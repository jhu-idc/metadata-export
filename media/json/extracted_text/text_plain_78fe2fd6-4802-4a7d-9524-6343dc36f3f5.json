This article is an interview with two<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins faculty who,in addition to being<br />\nhighly respected scholars, also happen to be gay. Under<br />\nthese circumstances, a professor's personnal life is more<br />\nlikely to come under consideration at different times and<br />\nfor different reasons, and Drs. N. and V. shared with me a<br />\nfew informal remarks about being gay in a university<br />\nsetting.<br />\nI asked Dr. N. if he felt that there was an<br />\nanti-homosexual policy among members of the<br />\nadministration. \"Despite its basic conversatism,\" he<br />\nanswered, \"Hopkins has an outstanding record. I can't<br />\nthink of a single instance where you could truly say<br />\nsomeone was discriminated against, and that goes back<br />\nthirty or forty years. But, of course, gay single men (and<br />\nwomen, if there were any) were expected to stay in line<br />\nand keep in the closet. On the other hand, gay men who<br />\nare married and have families, even those who are<br />\nshamelessly promiscuous or blatant, are not discriminated<br />\nagainst at all. I don't even think they're gossiped about,<br />\nunless, of course, they get in trouble with the law....I<br />\ncan't speak for the administration, but I do know that on<br />\nthis subject Steven Muller is absolutely open-minded. I<br />\nmean, that's an area where he's ahead of his time.\" While<br />\nagreeing that Dr. Muller is unprejudiced, Dr. V. was not so<br />\noptimistic otherwise, saying, \"There may well be no<br />\ndiscrimination against gay professors already here, but<br />\nthat isn't to say there hasn't been any in hiring.\"<br />\nThis led me to ask about intra-departmental attitudes<br />\ntoward homosexuality, and Dr. V. answered, \"I'd be<br />\nsurprised if any of my colleagues didn't know about me.<br />\nAlso, I'd be surprised if I didn't have some sort of<br />\nreputation among the undergraduates. I don't myself feel<br />\nuncomfortable being gay or having graduate students or<br />\ncolleagues know.\"<br />\n\"This I know,\" Dr. N. said when I asked about<br />\nattitudes in his department, \"that you can only come out<br />\nto certain colleagues. Others would be horrified if the<br />\nsubject were brought up. I've learned never to introduce<br />\nthe subject except with people I know are open to it.\"<br />\nWhen I asked if he had ever worried that being gay would<br />\neffect his employment, he answered, \"Sure. Up until ten<br />\nyears ago, that was a real consideration. When given<br />\ntenure at another, university, I was told that during the<br />\ndiscussion some members of the department had<br />\n<br />\nregistered their objections to my private life--which I had<br />\nthought was private.\"<br />\nOn the role of gays in universities, Dr. N. remarked, \"I<br />\nthink it's true in most universities that gay men are largely<br />\nleft out of the decision-making processes of the<br />\nuniversity, but that's not true of gay women. Gay women<br />\nusually become deans. Well, often become deans.\" What<br />\nabout coming out publicly? \"It still is,\" Dr. N. said, \"a<br />\nsocially unacceptable thing to declare yourself in public,<br />\nand I think it's ill-advised. I would still be considered a<br />\nbreach of decorum, but it would be better if it weren't<br />\nthat way. I am against this 'coming-out-in-the-classroom'<br />\nthing. Of course, if you're teaching a course in gay<br />\nstudies, it would be relevant; otherwise, it's political<br />\nexploitation of the classroom situation....Many students<br />\njust aren't ready for it. Of course, in ten years they may<br />\nbe\"<br />\nDr. V. had a number of remarks about political<br />\nactivitism at Hopkins. \"When I got here,\" he began in<br />\nresponse to a question about gay activitism, \"I was<br />\nastonished by the lack of political activism on campus. I<br />\nhad thought of leaving the country because of the<br />\nVietman War. The reception of the news of the bombing<br />\nof Cambodia was the only time I have seen anything like<br />\npolitical activism on this. campus, and what's more, it was<br />\nresented.\" He observed that gay life at Hopkins is still<br />\nquite closeted, relative to other universities, and said,<br />\n\"It's an anomaly that no member of the faculty has ever<br />\nattended a meeting of the Gay Caucus.\" At this point on<br />\nmy manuscript, Dr. N. interjected, \"Nobody ever invited<br />\nus,\" and Dr. V. continued with \"I think it's not an<br />\naccident that gay activism would increase with women on<br />\ncampus. I think things will gradually geget better.\"<br />\nWhen I asked why this situation existed, Dr. V.<br />\nsuggested two reasons for this. \"The faculty itself is<br />\nentrenched; they're academic mandarins to an extent not<br />\nexceede by any other university in the land. They're very<br />\nconscious of academic values, often vulgarly, and they<br />\npursue them, to the neglect of political and social issues.<br />\nThey're remarkably conservative. The second reason I<br />\nthink is basically the same, namely the extroardinary<br />\ncareerism of the undergraduates. A flourishingly careerist<br />\nmind in a healthy body seems to be the ideal.\"<br />\nDespite their criticisms, Drs. V. and N. had generally<br />\npositive attitudes toward Hopkins. Dr. V. probably<br />\nsummed this up best when he concluded that, \"All this<br />\nnot withstanding, Hopkins is a real university; I mean,<br />\nscholarship is seriously pursued.\"<br />\n<br />\n14ait<br />\nPython Redux<br />\n<br />\nA Modest Proposal<br />\n<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nIt mildly dismayed me to find t<br />\nthat the powers<br />\nthat apparently were showed us a cut version of \"Pleasure<br />\nat Her Majesty's\" (a.k.\"Monty Python meets Beyond the<br />\nFringe\").

Administrators are by definition the<br />\nguardians of our education, and everything they do is for<br />\nour own good; just ask anyone in Garland Hall or<br />\nHomewood House.<br />\nTo illustrate this necessity, consider the ecent decree<br />\nthat all Intersession courses shall be considered<br />\nindependent research. Without total faith in the<br />\nadministration, one might begin to wonder if some<br />\nconspiracy were underfoot. After all, they did this<br />\nwithout extending the maximum yearly amount of<br />\n<br />\nindepedent research credits to nin (it is now six), which<br />\nwould have made it possible for a student to both take<br />\nIntersession and do indepedent in the Fall and Spring<br />\nsessions. But under the present set of circumstances, we<br />\ncannot do this; and therefore, Intersession enrollment will<br />\ndrop for January, 1978.<br />\nRemember the honorable Dr. Muller's desire to scrap<br />\nIntersession? But no ... I have faith and recognize the<br />\nsituation as merely a curious coincidence.<br />\nOf course, a student who wisned to circumvent all of<br />\nthis could ask his independent research supervisor to<br />\ncreate a course for him. The course enrollment may turn<br />\nout to be only one, but there is no rule against that. But I<br />\nmust ask all students not to do this. It shows a lack of<br />\nfaith in the administration.

At that time, Mr.<br />\nSimms charged, Mr. Berchielli<br />\nwas \"uncooperative.\" Mr.<br />\nBerchielli stated that although he<br />\nhad contacted many students,<br />\nthere was very little interest in<br />\nthe project.<br />\nMr. Simms claimed that a<br />\nmajority of the JHU Republicans<br />\nfavor expanding the club's<br />\nactivity and that Mr. Berchielli's<br />\n\"isolationist\" attitude hindered<br />\nthe .club's development.

It is mediocrity<br />\nof which he is most frightened.<br />\nAnd so the reader is taken through the ups and downs<br />\nof Kepesh's life: tnat is, until middle-age, at which time<br />\nthe hero, resigned to a future devoid of the intensities of<br />\nYouth, concludes his monologue. What the unsuspecting<br />\nreader is subjected to is an at times tedious, but very<br />\noften witty, account of the frustrations oi college,<br />\nmarriage, and the beginnings of m:.le menopause. Oh,<br />\nthere are happy times, too, but they are usually so<br />\nClouded over with guilt or dwarfed by fantasies of greater<br />\n<br />\nglories that one is not allowed to appreciate them. This is<br />\nonly fair, for neither is Kepesh.<br />\nActually, poor Kepesh will never be satisfied. His two<br />\ngreat passions-- academia and sex--do not mix.This is not<br />\nan unfamiliar dilemma\u2014how to reconcile the cravings of<br />\nthe mind with those of the flesn\u2014and fortunately Roth<br />\ndoes not exploit it. Not surprisingly, Kepesh is unable to<br />\nconcentrate on his work when he is unfulfilled sexually,<br />\nand of COuTSC becomes quite prolific when he believes he<br />\nhas found the right ,- voman. What is unusual is Kepesh's<br />\nnarcissistic obsession with the condition of his own desire.<br />\nOne almost expects tam to devise some way of<br />\nquantifying it, so intent is he upon cataloguing nis variou.,<br />\nlusts. I believe it is this preoccupation with Ms own<br />\nemotional state tnat keeps him from attaining true<br />\nsatisfaction.<br />\nDavid Kepesh, like most people, always wants what he<br />\ndoesn't have. The problem is that he overlooks the<br />\npositive things he does have until lie has lost them. Then,<br />\nof course, he wants them even more. This insatiability is<br />\nboth intriguing and exasperating. He is absolutely<br />\nmiserable with nis wife, Helen, yet o ice he is rid of her he<br />\nremembers only the good things about her.-<br />\n<br />\nAnother problem with Kepesh is that he is victimize(<br />\nby externals. For all his strong desires,' he is incredibl)<br />\nlacking in courage. He canhot divorce ids intolerable wife<br />\ncannot put a stop to the persistent advances of an<br />\nobnoxious nomosexual, and, saddest of all, he cannot love<br />\nwithout regret. He accepts as inevitable the premature<br />\ndeath of desire, as if it were something regulated by a dial<br />\nsomewhere, rather than kindled from within.<br />\nThe novel has characters and themes of interest.<br />\nFreudians will appreciate Kepesh's breast fixation,<br />\nparticularly when he falls for a schoolteacher with the<br />\ndisposition and manner of his own mother. Claire is a true<br />\nEarth Mother: she g..rdens and sews and cooks--a perfect<br />\nsymbol of creativity and fer.ility. Herbie Bratasky is<br />\nunforgettable as young Kepesh's id.:1, as are Birgitta and<br />\nmany of the other women, who, in their uni,,ue ways,<br />\nattempt to satisfy Kepesh's many lusts.<br />\nRoth's style is very appealing for several reasons. The<br />\nuse of the first person establishes an immediate rapport<br />\nbetween narrator and reader, who is drawn into the story<br />\n'from the very beginning by the vivid, flowing prose.<br />\nCharacters are drawn witih an impeccable attention to<br />\ndetail that makes them unique, living individuals. The<br />\nbook is far from boring, and can even be iuite amusing if<br />\none can tolerate the relentless and often annoyingly<br />\nself-indulgent soul-searching. 1 nad .problems accepting<br />\nKepesh's weaknesses, but found them interesting<br />\nnevertheless.

What he fails to see is that singular devotion to<br />\nanything, be it a piece of music or the pursuit of love,<br />\nmust inevitable become not only tiring, but deeply<br />\ndisappointing as well.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 6/DECEMBER 2,1977<br />\n<br />\nEssayist Picks<br />\nThrough<br />\nThe Rubble<br />\nBY MIKE GUILIANO.<br />\nMissing Persons and Other Essays. By Heinrich Boll.<br />\nTranslated from the German by Leila Vennewitz. 281<br />\npages. McGraw-Hill. $9.95. Available at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Book Center.<br />\n\"Human imagination and delight in storytelling are<br />\nevidently no match for documents..\"Heinrich Boll.<br />\n\"We write essays? who reads essays?\" Irving Howe.<br />\nAs Irving Howe suggests, essays are not the most<br />\npopular literary form, though several essayists, John<br />\nUpdike, E.B. White and Howe among them, have<br />\ncontinuted to write distinguished pieces of non-fiction.<br />\nHeinrich Boll, another member of this select group, has<br />\nenjoyed much critical renown in America for the English<br />\ntranslations of his novels, and the American press has<br />\ngiven him a small measure of notoriety in reporting his<br />\npolitical views and confrontations with the conservative<br />\nGerman press, but what American readers have not<br />\nreceived, until the publication of this book, is a collection<br />\nof Boll's non-fiction prose. Many of us have read, or are at<br />\nleast familiar with, a few of the books Boll has written<br />\nsince the second World War, among them Billiards at<br />\nHalf-Past Ninee, (1962) The Clown,(1%5)Group Portrait<br />\nWith Lady,(1973) and The Lost Honor of Katharine Blum<br />\n(1975) the last of which even surfaced in Baltimore as a<br />\nrather mediocre film a year or so ago.<br />\nBoll has been writing essays during that same period,<br />\nand now English readers have access to a selection of 29<br />\nessays, reviews and miscellaneous pieces<br />\nspanning twenty-some<br />\nyears. Unfortunately, although<br />\nMissing Persons includes many satiric comments and<br />\nbitter observations about contemporary Germany, there is<br />\nvirtually no mention of the very issues that have<br />\npreoccupied Boll since the early 1970's, namely the<br />\nGerman press, urban terrorists, and West Germany's<br />\nfrightening right-wing backlash. Indeed, Boll, a Catholic<br />\npacifist, has been the whipping-boy of conservative<br />\npoliticians and newspapers, for they accuse him of<br />\nencouraging a radical climate that fosters utban terrorists<br />\nlike the Baader-Meinhof group. Boll's numerous<br />\nstatements, including television appearances, in his<br />\nself-defense have not appeased the conservative<br />\nopposition. Fellow-dovelist Gunter Grass described the<br />\nattacks on Boll as part of \"a witch-hunt against writers,<br />\nintellectuals, and men of the church, a witch-hunt which<br />\nis spreading into newspaper editorial rooms.\" It is Boll's<br />\nmisfortune. that he is all three-- a Catholic, an intellectual,<br />\nand a novelist. Although he is a pacifist as well, lie has<br />\ndefended himself admirably, and, for that matter, has<br />\nlaunched his own counterattack in articles and speeches,<br />\nas well as in his novels, particularly in Tne Lost Honor of<br />\nKatharine Blunz, a sharp criticism of the sensationalistic,<br />\n\"yellow,' reactionary West German press.<br />\nMany of the essays in Missing Persons were written<br />\nin recent years, but they do not comment on the<br />\nparticular situation outlined above, and it's a<br />\ndisappointing omission that will hopefully be rectified in<br />\nfuture translations of Boll essays. What disappoints, then,<br />\nis not what is present in Missing Persons, but what is<br />\nmissing, for the volume includes many interesting, and a<br />\nfew compelling, essays. The title essay, for instance,<br />\nrecords the author's search for his mother, not as she<br />\nremains in memory, but as she really was as a little girl.<br />\nThe search broadens to include not only Boll himself, but<br />\nthe entire past itself: \"I am looking for myself, aged ten,<br />\nriding to school on mybicycle...lt is not the permanent I<br />\nam z4fter but the present that has become the<br />\npast...I want the present of those who belong to the<br />\npast.\"<br />\nIn a sense that is Boll's task as a novelist, to present<br />\nthe past as present, to explore the recent German past,<br />\nhandling it as he would handle contemporaryreality. The<br />\ntitle essay, \"Missing Persons,\" says as much in a general<br />\nway. but other essays, especially \"Trying to Close the<br />\nGap,\" are much more specific. In that latter essay Boll<br />\nproceeds from a discussion of War and Peace as an<br />\nhistorical novel, to several observations on the<br />\nrelationship between fiction and history: \"Every novel,<br />\nunless it is Utopian, is historical, even the so-called<br />\n'contemporary novel.' The inevitable time lag between<br />\nwriting and publishing is in itself enough to turn the<br />\nthematic in<br />\ninto history.\" By turning all novelists,<br />\nor nearly all novelists, into historians, Boll, no doubt,<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nr<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nfeels more comfortable hi vindicating his own role as an<br />\nhistorical novelist: \"I am an author, I write novels, all of<br />\nthem attempts to close the gap to all that is inexplicable<br />\nin recent German history.\"<br />\nBoll's defense of one type of novel, the historical, is<br />\naccompanied by a defense of the subject matter found in<br />\nso many novels written about the Second World War,<br />\nwhat Boll has called the literature of war, rubble and<br />\nhomecoming. Two essays, \"In Defense of Washtubs\" and<br />\n\"In Defense of 'Rubble Literature,\" are discussions of<br />\nthe 'rubble literature' produced by the Second World War.<br />\nAlthough the first essay is humorous and effectively<br />\nmakes its point, the second essay provides a somewhat<br />\nmore serorious definition of what is meant by the term<br />\n`rubble literature.\"<br />\n\"The first literary attempts of our generation since<br />\n1945,\" explains Boll, \"have been described as excessively<br />\npreoccupied with the bomb-ravaged cities and towns of<br />\nGermany and hence dismissed as 'rubble literature.' \"<br />\nBoll, defending this school, takes delight in the fact that<br />\nthe prototype of all Western authors, Homer, was likewise<br />\npreoccupied with war, rubble and homecoming. Just as<br />\nDickens, growing up in a milieu of workhouses and<br />\nprisons, eventually wrote about and criticized that<br />\nenvironment, Boll, as a schoolchild reading Mein Kamph<br />\nand as a young man in the German army, collected the<br />\nstorehouse of experiences and observations on which he<br />\nhas built his career. If he writes 'rubble literature,' it is<br />\nsimply because Germany during and immediately after<br />\nthe War was a land of war, rubble, and homecomings.<br />\nCritics of Boll's approach sometimes note that because<br />\nthe War was and no longer is, Boll's preoccupation with it,<br />\neven in his \u2022novels of contemporary German life, is<br />\ninappropriate, an expression of his own partcular<br />\nbackground and obsessions rather than an accurate<br />\nportrayal of Germany. In one beautifully-written<br />\nparagraph, Boll,defends 'rubble literature.\"And behind the dusty windows of a small factory the<br />\nwriter's eye sees a young girl standing at a machine<br />\npunching out buttons, buttons without which our clothes<br />\nwould not be garments but pieces of cloth hanging loosely<br />\non us, neither adorning us nor keeping us warm; this<br />\nyoung working girl wears lipstick when sue is not at work,<br />\nalso goes to the movies, smokes cigarettes, goes walking<br />\nwith a young man who repairs cars or drives a bus. And it<br />\nis part of this young girl that her mother lies buried<br />\nsomewhere beneath a pile of rubble: under a mound of<br />\ndirty bricks and mortar, somewhere deep in the ground<br />\nlies the mother of this girl and her grave has no cross.<br />\nVery rarely--once in a year--the girl goes to the spot and<br />\nlays some flowers on that dirty pile of rubble under w!tich<br />\nher mother lies buried.\u2014<br />\nModern Germany has constructed skyscrapers and<br />\nfactories over the rubble and over the mother's grave, but<br />\nof Germans alive today who<br />\nthere are in<br />\nexperienced the War, and millions more, like that young<br />\nworking girl, who have been affected by it, for no matter<br />\nhow much makeup and lipstick the girl wears, regardless<br />\nof how modern her lifestyle might be, there r, still.<br />\nbeneath the personal and social cosmetics, within herself<br />\nand within her society, rubble. Wars and their devastating<br />\neffects don't end with the armistices, even though many<br />\nWest German officials and teacners have tried to ignore or<br />\ndownplay the Nazi years, as if there had never been any<br />\nrubble.<br />\nBoll must shudder when informed of a recent poll<br />\ntaken among West German schoolchildren, which found<br />\nthat quite a few had no idea who Adolph Hitler was,<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n.1<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\nI<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nwhile others admired the Nazi regime .tor the solidarity<br />\nand stability the German people displayed. There are also,<br />\nas Boll has noted, and as Marcel Ophuls has recorded in<br />\nThe Memory of Justice, thousands of unrepentant Nazis<br />\nin Germany. The entire climate, political and social, is<br />\nbecoming more conservative, more aggressively<br />\nnationalistic, which can only frighten Boll, as well as<br />\nothers who see that beneath the cosmetics there are piles<br />\nof rubble-- remnants from the last War and ominous<br />\nportents for the future. Several essays in ,Missing<br />\nPersons, discuss, admire and defend another writer of<br />\n'rubble literature,' Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who, when<br />\nexiled from the U.S.S.R., was flown to West Germany<br />\nand secluded in Boll's country retreat. This collection<br />\nincludes essays about Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Want, The Oak:<br />\nand tile Calf, Stories and Prose Poems, The First Circle,<br />\nand The Gulag Archipelago. Commenting on one of the<br />\nmore horrifying facts recorded in Gulag, Stalin's<br />\nimprisonment of liberated Russian P.O.W.'s because they<br />\nhad iiad contact with Germans, Boll adds a chilling,<br />\npersonal note of his own: \"I recall having looked on, from<br />\nthe inner cage of an American prisoner-of-war camp,<br />\nwhile former Russian P.O.W.'s had to be positively forced<br />\ninto rail cars and trucks, many of them screaming and<br />\nresisting in vain. At the time wt.: did not grasp the terrible<br />\nsignificance of what was happening: we only found out<br />\nlater. They were being taken to the Gulag Archipelago.\"<br />\nTime collection also includes Boll's locture foi the 1972<br />\nNobel Prize in Literature, ossays on Sean O'Casey,<br />\nNorthern Ireland, BrendanBelian, and Bernard Malamud's<br />\nThe Fixer. Generally speaking, those essays dealing with<br />\nRussian nuth ors like Solzhenitsyn, Tolstoi and<br />\nDostoevsky, and those concerning Boll's observations on<br />\nthe Second World War, provide the most interesting<br />\nreading. What, personally, I find the most compelling and<br />\nmemorable essay is \"The Gun Was Aimed at Kafka.\" Bolt<br />\nhappened to bc in Prague in August, 1968 when the<br />\nRussians invaded, and ins account of the events is<br />\nstriking:\"The shot., were live, and numerous, and they<br />\nswept us back twenty-five years and a few months. The<br />\nshots declared categorically: Europe knows no peace, it<br />\nexists in a state of varying armistices. Here, in Prague, an<br />\narmistice was being broken...Outside the building where<br />\nKafka was born stood a tank, its gun barrel aimed at the<br />\nbust of Kafka.\"<br />\nThe Writing Seminars is placing greater emphasis on<br />\nthe media in its spring course offerings, with two<br />\nnewspaper internships and o ic television internship.<br />\nA course given in conjunct!on with the Baltintote<br />\nNews-A merican.

Admission to this pass/fail course is on a<br />\ncompetitive basis and is limited to five juniors or seniors.<br />\nStudent interns are assigned to an editor or section of the<br />\nnewspaper, and report one day a week to either work in<br />\nthe office or p.ck up assignments. Another, recentlY<br />\nstarted newspaper internship with the Baltimore<br />\nSunpapers is limited to three students. Also, a new<br />\ninternship with WJZ TV (ABC, Channel 13) has openings<br />\nfor three students.<br />\nBecause competition for these positions s intensive,<br />\npreference is given to juniors or seniors with experience<br />\nand career plans in these areas.

The sensual effects are so strong as to go<br />\nfar beyond a merely decorative function, and must not be<br />\nshrugged off as such. Kubrick is in control throughout the<br />\nfilm, as is evident by the precision of his work: first, the<br />\npure technical quality which exceeds out expectations as<br />\nto touch our imaginations; second, the synchronization of<br />\nassociative artworks within the overall film - the sterile<br />\nsecuality of tile people and their culture as reflected in<br />\ntheir white plastic sculptures and flat, stylised nude<br />\npaintings, their meaningless white and silver \"pop\" decor<br />\nand vynl wardrobes - juxtaposed against an overwhelming<br />\n\u2022 score which gives a sense of vitality so absent from the<br />\nfuturistic culture; and third, Kubrick's successful and<br />\nmeticulous manipulation not only of his medium, but of<br />\nus, the viewers.<br />\nThe film deals with several common ethical theemes in<br />\nan uncommon manner, basically contrastin and<br />\ncomparing Alex, young murderer/rapist/social outcast and a cold futuristic society of mediocre, insipid people.<br />\nIn this context, Alex brings out the same genius of vitality<br />\nas the music that inspires hini; his violence is a relief, as<br />\nwe are hypnotized by the lyrical narration and mehagerie<br />\nof images. In one sense Alex is forced to watch films with<br />\nhis eyelids pinned open. The close-up of his eyes as lie<br />\nstrains to close them is painful to watcn, as it reflects our<br />\nown will and inability to look away from the screen.<br />\nWhat, then, is Kubrick's point? I could hunt out a<br />\nmeaning, bet that would be limiting tile scope of the film.<br />\nThe important thing is to watch the visual themes: the<br />\n/repetitive blank white areas at the back of several shots,<br />\nthe channel-shpaed sets that continually surround Alex,<br />\nthe psychological test he takes near the end which repeats<br />\nOn a small test screen earlier themes. The idea of watching<br />\na film is emphasised within tile film - the audience being,<br />\nconditioned, the director in control, the frame mirroring<br />\nour own situation. Kubrick makes us look, teases as, and.<br />\n,<br />\nraises questions about the roles of control, sex, violence,<br />\nSystems of law, and filmmaking in itself. The pot is not.l.<br />\nKubrick's conclusion, if lie has one sure conclusion; the<br />\nPoint is not what he makes us see but how ne makes us:,<br />\nsee. That is the importance of the film, and the mot,<br />\nsatisfying aspect of it. As Alex says: \"It's funny how the<br />\ncolors of the real world are only seem really real when,<br />\nYou viddy them o,n the screen.\"<br />\n<br />\nMore Making It<br />\nCOIVTINUED FROM PAGE 8<br />\nThrowing the floor open to questions from the<br />\naudience, Ms. Raskin colunteered opinions on a variety of<br />\ntopics. On the financial future of music in America, and<br />\nits artistic future as well, she refused to categorize<br />\nthe<br />\nsituation as \"bleak.\" Foundations such as the Ford<br />\nfoundation's music programs, and the National<br />\nEndowment for the Arts (on which she srved for four<br />\nYears as chairperson of the opera panel), have oily arisen<br />\nIn the past ten or twelve years. \"We've been through<br />\nbleak; the future will be different.\"<br />\nOn nervousness on stage, she observed that this is ften<br />\na psychological problem; a singer often must develop<br />\nforms of mental protection for himself. \"I tell inysel,,<br />\nI'm OK.'...We tend, as singers, to want to be loved. When<br />\nwe are not loved, we feel rejected.\"<br />\nPeabody's lecture series continues with Jeanne<br />\nRehrend, pianist, discussing and performing American<br />\nPiano music on December 7, and George Mendelssohn de<br />\nHartholdy, President of Vox Records, discussing<br />\n'Musicians and the Recording Industry in America\" on<br />\n<br />\nDecember 14.

Unfortunately, the film has<br />\nlittle else to offer, and eventually even the photography<br />\n. lapses into what Pauline Kael calls \"calendar art.\"<br />\nKubrick's visual compositions take on the sensationalistic<br />\n;and sometimes erotic character of a calendar on the wall<br />\nof an adolescent who thinks such grotesque distortions of<br />\nthe human condition are, essentially, real.<br />\nIn the movie, Alex, the anti-social punk wit() serves as a<br />\n, hero, is subjected the the LudovicoTreatment, a sort of<br />\nbehavior modification process based on conditioned<br />\nresponses. Kubrick seemingly takes the tack that such<br />\n\"treatment\" is inhuman and despicable. Yet, at the same<br />\ntime, the audience is subjected to the Kubrick Treatment.<br />\nThe audience's response to the movie is shaped by the<br />\nsame psychological theory. For example, when Kubrick<br />\nshows that frolicsome group sex scene sped up to the tune<br />\nof the William Tell Overture, the audience laughs at the<br />\nincongruity between the music (memories of the Lone<br />\nRanger cah't be suspended) and the image. Kubrick is<br />\nplaying on the cinematically induced conditioned<br />\nresponse, just as the Ludivico Treatmentdepends upon<br />\ninstinctively induced conditiohed responses. Alex has a<br />\ndrug which promotes the response; the movie audience<br />\nhas its catalogue of cinematic devices to form a reaction.<br />\nLately I have asked several Kubrick admirers to<br />\nelucidate the theme(s) of A Clockwork Orange. Needless<br />\nto say, no one could give an answer that made much<br />\nsense. \"Well, you know it's political, moral, social,<br />\nreligious, and you know, somethin of everything.\"<br />\nUh-huh. This seems to confirm my suspicions; Kubrick<br />\nhimself doesn't know what he is trying to say. Kubrick<br />\nhas a dim view of modern man, a species seemingly<br />\nincapable of asserting itself by other than violent means.<br />\nTechnology overwhelms the individual in this future.<br />\nKubrick wants to condemn this, but contradicts himself<br />\nbecause he uses cinematic technology to overwhelm the<br />\naudience.<br />\nOverall, A Clockwork Orange is not as great as<br />\neveryone seems to think. The film has a sensationalistic<br />\nquality wortny of tabloid sociology. Every now and then<br />\na movie comes along ahd appeals to the dark side of the<br />\nhuman psyche. Perhaps the Clockwork Orange enthusiasts<br />\nin some way feel guilty about their own repressed<br />\n. violence.

This article is an interview with two<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins faculty who,in addition to being<br />\nhighly respected scholars, also happen to be gay. Under<br />\nthese circumstances, a professor's personnal life is more<br />\nlikely to come under consideration at different times and<br />\nfor different reasons, and Drs. N. and V. shared with me a<br />\nfew informal remarks about being gay in a university<br />\nsetting.<br />\nI asked Dr. N. if he felt that there was an<br />\nanti-homosexual policy among members of the<br />\nadministration. \"Despite its basic conversatism,\" he<br />\nanswered, \"Hopkins has an outstanding record. I can't<br />\nthink of a single instance where you could truly say<br />\nsomeone was discriminated against, and that goes back<br />\nthirty or forty years. But, of course, gay single men (and<br />\nwomen, if there were any) were expected to stay in line<br />\nand keep in the closet. On the other hand, gay men who<br />\nare married and have families, even those who are<br />\nshamelessly promiscuous or blatant, are not discriminated<br />\nagainst at all. I don't even think they're gossiped about,<br />\nunless, of course, they get in trouble with the law....I<br />\ncan't speak for the administration, but I do know that on<br />\nthis subject Steven Muller is absolutely open-minded. I<br />\nmean, that's an area where he's ahead of his time.\" While<br />\nagreeing that Dr. Muller is unprejudiced, Dr. V. was not so<br />\noptimistic otherwise, saying, \"There may well be no<br />\ndiscrimination against gay professors already here, but<br />\nthat isn't to say there hasn't been any in hiring.\"<br />\nThis led me to ask about intra-departmental attitudes<br />\ntoward homosexuality, and Dr. V. answered, \"I'd be<br />\nsurprised if any of my colleagues didn't know about me.<br />\nAlso, I'd be surprised if I didn't have some sort of<br />\nreputation among the undergraduates. I don't myself feel<br />\nuncomfortable being gay or having graduate students or<br />\ncolleagues know.\"<br />\n\"This I know,\" Dr. N. said when I asked about<br />\nattitudes in his department, \"that you can only come out<br />\nto certain colleagues. Others would be horrified if the<br />\nsubject were brought up. I've learned never to introduce<br />\nthe subject except with people I know are open to it.\"<br />\nWhen I asked if he had ever worried that being gay would<br />\neffect his employment, he answered, \"Sure. Up until ten<br />\nyears ago, that was a real consideration. When given<br />\ntenure at another, university, I was told that during the<br />\ndiscussion some members of the department had<br /><br />\nregistered their objections to my private life--which I had<br />\nthought was private.\"<br />\nOn the role of gays in universities, Dr. N. remarked, \"I<br />\nthink it's true in most universities that gay men are largely<br />\nleft out of the decision-making processes of the<br />\nuniversity, but that's not true of gay women. Gay women<br />\nusually become deans. Well, often become deans.\" What<br />\nabout coming out publicly? \"It still is,\" Dr. N. said, \"a<br />\nsocially unacceptable thing to declare yourself in public,<br />\nand I think it's ill-advised. I would still be considered a<br />\nbreach of decorum, but it would be better if it weren't<br />\nthat way. I am against this 'coming-out-in-the-classroom'<br />\nthing. Of course, if you're teaching a course in gay<br />\nstudies, it would be relevant; otherwise, it's political<br />\nexploitation of the classroom situation....Many students<br />\njust aren't ready for it. Of course, in ten years they may<br />\nbe\"<br />\nDr. V. had a number of remarks about political<br />\nactivitism at Hopkins. \"When I got here,\" he began in<br />\nresponse to a question about gay activitism, \"I was<br />\nastonished by the lack of political activism on campus. I<br />\nhad thought of leaving the country because of the<br />\nVietman War. The reception of the news of the bombing<br />\nof Cambodia was the only time I have seen anything like<br />\npolitical activism on this. campus, and what's more, it was<br />\nresented.\" He observed that gay life at Hopkins is still<br />\nquite closeted, relative to other universities, and said,<br />\n\"It's an anomaly that no member of the faculty has ever<br />\nattended a meeting of the Gay Caucus.\" At this point on<br />\nmy manuscript, Dr. N. interjected, \"Nobody ever invited<br />\nus,\" and Dr. V. continued with \"I think it's not an<br />\naccident that gay activism would increase with women on<br />\ncampus. I think things will gradually geget better.\"<br />\nWhen I asked why this situation existed, Dr. V.<br />\nsuggested two reasons for this. \"The faculty itself is<br />\nentrenched; they're academic mandarins to an extent not<br />\nexceede by any other university in the land. They're very<br />\nconscious of academic values, often vulgarly, and they<br />\npursue them, to the neglect of political and social issues.<br />\nThey're remarkably conservative. The second reason I<br />\nthink is basically the same, namely the extroardinary<br />\ncareerism of the undergraduates. A flourishingly careerist<br />\nmind in a healthy body seems to be the ideal.\"<br />\nDespite their criticisms, Drs. V. and N. had generally<br />\npositive attitudes toward Hopkins. Dr. V. probably<br />\nsummed this up best when he concluded that, \"All this<br />\nnot withstanding, Hopkins is a real university; I mean,<br />\nscholarship is seriously pursued.\"<br /><br />\n14ait<br />\nPython Redux<br /><br />\nA Modest Proposal<br /><br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nIt mildly dismayed me to find t<br />\nthat the powers<br />\nthat apparently were showed us a cut version of \"Pleasure<br />\nat Her Majesty's\" (a.k.\"Monty Python meets Beyond the<br />\nFringe\").

After all, they did this<br />\nwithout extending the maximum yearly amount of<br /><br />\nindepedent research credits to nin (it is now six), which<br />\nwould have made it possible for a student to both take<br />\nIntersession and do indepedent in the Fall and Spring<br />\nsessions.

But no ... I have faith and recognize the<br />\nsituation as merely a curious coincidence.<br />\nOf course, a student who wisned to circumvent all of<br />\nthis could ask his independent research supervisor to<br />\ncreate a course for him. The course enrollment may turn<br />\nout to be only one, but there is no rule against that. But I<br />\nmust ask all students not to do this. It shows a lack of<br />\nfaith in the administration.

The book, though depressing for the must part, is<br />\nwell-written and revealing.<br />\nThe theme of the novel itself\u2014how one man deals<br />\nWith his numerous and consuming desires-; s fascinating.<br />\nWe all experience passion: for art, for knowledge, for<br />\npossessiohs, etc. We devote ourselves to people and to<br />\nIdeals. What is so interesting about David Kepesh, the<br />\nnarrator, is that\u2022his ?reate-si love is passion itself. He is<br />\nequally satisfied with' melancholy a.\u201e with elation, as lung<br />\nas what he feels is an extreme of emotion. It is mediocrity<br />\nof which he is most frightened.<br />\nAnd so the reader is taken through the ups and downs<br />\nof Kepesh's life: tnat is, until middle-age, at which time<br />\nthe hero, resigned to a future devoid of the intensities of<br />\nYouth, concludes his monologue. What the unsuspecting<br />\nreader is subjected to is an at times tedious, but very<br />\noften witty, account of the frustrations oi college,<br />\nmarriage, and the beginnings of m:.le menopause. Oh,<br />\nthere are happy times, too, but they are usually so<br />\nClouded over with guilt or dwarfed by fantasies of greater<br /><br />\nglories that one is not allowed to appreciate them. This is<br />\nonly fair, for neither is Kepesh.<br />\nActually, poor Kepesh will never be satisfied.

Not surprisingly, Kepesh is unable to<br />\nconcentrate on his work when he is unfulfilled sexually,<br />\nand of COuTSC becomes quite prolific when he believes he<br />\nhas found the right ,- voman. What is unusual is Kepesh's<br />\nnarcissistic obsession with the condition of his own desire.<br />\nOne almost expects tam to devise some way of<br />\nquantifying it, so intent is he upon cataloguing nis variou.,<br />\nlusts. I believe it is this preoccupation with Ms own<br />\nemotional state tnat keeps him from attaining true<br />\nsatisfaction.<br />\nDavid Kepesh, like most people, always wants what he<br />\ndoesn't have. The problem is that he overlooks the<br />\npositive things he does have until lie has lost them. Then,<br />\nof course, he wants them even more. This insatiability is<br />\nboth intriguing and exasperating. He is absolutely<br />\nmiserable with nis wife, Helen, yet o ice he is rid of her he<br />\nremembers only the good things about her.-<br /><br />\nAnother problem with Kepesh is that he is victimize(<br />\nby externals.

He canhot divorce ids intolerable wife<br />\ncannot put a stop to the persistent advances of an<br />\nobnoxious nomosexual, and, saddest of all, he cannot love<br />\nwithout regret.

By Heinrich Boll.<br />\nTranslated from the German by Leila Vennewitz. 281<br />\npages. McGraw-Hill. $9.95. Available at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Book Center.<br />\n\"Human imagination and delight in storytelling are<br />\nevidently no match for documents..\"Heinrich Boll.<br />\n\"We write essays? who reads essays?\" Irving Howe.<br />\nAs Irving Howe suggests, essays are not the most<br />\npopular literary form, though several essayists, John<br />\nUpdike, E.B. White and Howe among them, have<br />\ncontinuted to write distinguished pieces of non-fiction.<br />\nHeinrich Boll, another member of this select group, has<br />\nenjoyed much critical renown in America for the English<br />\ntranslations of his novels, and the American press has<br />\ngiven him a small measure of notoriety in reporting his<br />\npolitical views and confrontations with the conservative<br />\nGerman press, but what American readers have not<br />\nreceived, until the publication of this book, is a collection<br />\nof Boll's non-fiction prose. Many of us have read, or are at<br />\nleast familiar with, a few of the books Boll has written<br />\nsince the second World War, among them Billiards at<br />\nHalf-Past Ninee, (1962) The Clown,(1%5)Group Portrait<br />\nWith Lady,(1973) and The Lost Honor of Katharine Blum<br />\n(1975) the last of which even surfaced in Baltimore as a<br />\nrather mediocre film a year or so ago.<br />\nBoll has been writing essays during that same period,<br />\nand now English readers have access to a selection of 29<br />\nessays, reviews and miscellaneous pieces<br />\nspanning twenty-some<br />\nyears. Unfortunately, although<br />\nMissing Persons includes many satiric comments and<br />\nbitter observations about contemporary Germany, there is<br />\nvirtually no mention of the very issues that have<br />\npreoccupied Boll since the early 1970's, namely the<br />\nGerman press, urban terrorists, and West Germany's<br />\nfrightening right-wing backlash. Indeed, Boll, a Catholic<br />\npacifist, has been the whipping-boy of conservative<br />\npoliticians and newspapers, for they accuse him of<br />\nencouraging a radical climate that fosters utban terrorists<br />\nlike the Baader-Meinhof group. Boll's numerous<br />\nstatements, including television appearances, in his<br />\nself-defense have not appeased the conservative<br />\nopposition. Fellow-dovelist Gunter Grass described the<br />\nattacks on Boll as part of \"a witch-hunt against writers,<br />\nintellectuals, and men of the church, a witch-hunt which<br />\nis spreading into newspaper editorial rooms.\" It is Boll's<br />\nmisfortune. that he is all three-- a Catholic, an intellectual,<br />\nand a novelist. Although he is a pacifist as well, lie has<br />\ndefended himself admirably, and, for that matter, has<br />\nlaunched his own counterattack in articles and speeches,<br />\nas well as in his novels, particularly in Tne Lost Honor of<br />\nKatharine Blunz, a sharp criticism of the sensationalistic,<br />\n\"yellow,' reactionary West German press.<br />\nMany of the essays in Missing Persons were written<br />\nin recent years, but they do not comment on the<br />\nparticular situation outlined above, and it's a<br />\ndisappointing omission that will hopefully be rectified in<br />\nfuture translations of Boll essays. What disappoints, then,<br />\nis not what is present in Missing Persons, but what is<br />\nmissing, for the volume includes many interesting, and a<br />\nfew compelling, essays. The title essay, for instance,<br />\nrecords the author's search for his mother, not as she<br />\nremains in memory, but as she really was as a little girl.<br />\nThe search broadens to include not only Boll himself, but<br />\nthe entire past itself: \"I am looking for myself, aged ten,<br />\nriding to school on mybicycle...lt is not the permanent I<br />\nam z4fter but the present that has become the<br />\npast...I want the present of those who belong to the<br />\npast.\"<br />\nIn a sense that is Boll's task as a novelist, to present<br />\nthe past as present, to explore the recent German past,<br />\nhandling it as he would handle contemporaryreality. The<br />\ntitle essay, \"Missing Persons,\" says as much in a general<br />\nway. but other essays, especially \"Trying to Close the<br />\nGap,\" are much more specific. In that latter essay Boll<br />\nproceeds from a discussion of War and Peace as an<br />\nhistorical novel, to several observations on the<br />\nrelationship between fiction and history: \"Every novel,<br />\nunless it is Utopian, is historical, even the so-called<br />\n'contemporary novel.' The inevitable time lag between<br />\nwriting and publishing is in itself enough to turn the<br />\nthematic in<br />\ninto history.\" By turning all novelists,<br />\nor nearly all novelists, into historians, Boll, no doubt,<br /><br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nr<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br /><br />\nfeels more comfortable hi vindicating his own role as an<br />\nhistorical novelist: \"I am an author, I write novels, all of<br />\nthem attempts to close the gap to all that is inexplicable<br />\nin recent German history.\"<br />\nBoll's defense of one type of novel, the historical, is<br />\naccompanied by a defense of the subject matter found in<br />\nso many novels written about the Second World War,<br />\nwhat Boll has called the literature of war, rubble and<br />\nhomecoming. Two essays, \"In Defense of Washtubs\" and<br />\n\"In Defense of 'Rubble Literature,\" are discussions of<br />\nthe 'rubble literature' produced by the Second World War.<br />\nAlthough the first essay is humorous and effectively<br />\nmakes its point, the second essay provides a somewhat<br />\nmore serorious definition of what is meant by the term<br />\n`rubble literature.\"<br />\n\"The first literary attempts of our generation since<br />\n1945,\" explains Boll, \"have been described as excessively<br />\npreoccupied with the bomb-ravaged cities and towns of<br />\nGermany and hence dismissed as 'rubble literature.' \"<br />\nBoll, defending this school, takes delight in the fact that<br />\nthe prototype of all Western authors, Homer, was likewise<br />\npreoccupied with war, rubble and homecoming. Just as<br />\nDickens, growing up in a milieu of workhouses and<br />\nprisons, eventually wrote about and criticized that<br />\nenvironment, Boll, as a schoolchild reading Mein Kamph<br />\nand as a young man in the German army, collected the<br />\nstorehouse of experiences and observations on which he<br />\nhas built his career. If he writes 'rubble literature,' it is<br />\nsimply because Germany during and immediately after<br />\nthe War was a land of war, rubble, and homecomings.<br />\nCritics of Boll's approach sometimes note that because<br />\nthe War was and no longer is, Boll's preoccupation with it,<br />\neven in his \u2022novels of contemporary German life, is<br />\ninappropriate, an expression of his own partcular<br />\nbackground and obsessions rather than an accurate<br />\nportrayal of Germany. In one beautifully-written<br />\nparagraph, Boll,defends 'rubble literature.\"And behind the dusty windows of a small factory the<br />\nwriter's eye sees a young girl standing at a machine<br />\npunching out buttons, buttons without which our clothes<br />\nwould not be garments but pieces of cloth hanging loosely<br />\non us, neither adorning us nor keeping us warm; this<br />\nyoung working girl wears lipstick when sue is not at work,<br />\nalso goes to the movies, smokes cigarettes, goes walking<br />\nwith a young man who repairs cars or drives a bus. And it<br />\nis part of this young girl that her mother lies buried<br />\nsomewhere beneath a pile of rubble: under a mound of<br />\ndirty bricks and mortar, somewhere deep in the ground<br />\nlies the mother of this girl and her grave has no cross.<br />\nVery rarely--once in a year--the girl goes to the spot and<br />\nlays some flowers on that dirty pile of rubble under w!tich<br />\nher mother lies buried.\u2014<br />\nModern Germany has constructed skyscrapers and<br />\nfactories over the rubble and over the mother's grave, but<br />\nof Germans alive today who<br />\nthere are in<br />\nexperienced the War, and millions more, like that young<br />\nworking girl, who have been affected by it, for no matter<br />\nhow much makeup and lipstick the girl wears, regardless<br />\nof how modern her lifestyle might be, there r, still.<br />\nbeneath the personal and social cosmetics, within herself<br />\nand within her society, rubble. Wars and their devastating<br />\neffects don't end with the armistices, even though many<br />\nWest German officials and teacners have tried to ignore or<br />\ndownplay the Nazi years, as if there had never been any<br />\nrubble.<br />\nBoll must shudder when informed of a recent poll<br />\ntaken among West German schoolchildren, which found<br />\nthat quite a few had no idea who Adolph Hitler was,<br /><br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n.1<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n1<br />\nI<br />\n1<br /><br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n1<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br />\nwhile others admired the Nazi regime .tor the solidarity<br />\nand stability the German people displayed. There are also,<br />\nas Boll has noted, and as Marcel Ophuls has recorded in<br />\nThe Memory of Justice, thousands of unrepentant Nazis<br />\nin Germany. The entire climate, political and social, is<br />\nbecoming more conservative, more aggressively<br />\nnationalistic, which can only frighten Boll, as well as<br />\nothers who see that beneath the cosmetics there are piles<br />\nof rubble-- remnants from the last War and ominous<br />\nportents for the future. Several essays in ,Missing<br />\nPersons, discuss, admire and defend another writer of<br />\n'rubble literature,' Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who, when<br />\nexiled from the U.S.S.R., was flown to West Germany<br />\nand secluded in Boll's country retreat. This collection<br />\nincludes essays about Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Want, The Oak:<br />\nand tile Calf, Stories and Prose Poems, The First Circle,<br />\nand The Gulag Archipelago. Commenting on one of the<br />\nmore horrifying facts recorded in Gulag, Stalin's<br />\nimprisonment of liberated Russian P.O.W.'s because they<br />\nhad iiad contact with Germans, Boll adds a chilling,<br />\npersonal note of his own: \"I recall having looked on, from<br />\nthe inner cage of an American prisoner-of-war camp,<br />\nwhile former Russian P.O.W.'s had to be positively forced<br />\ninto rail cars and trucks, many of them screaming and<br />\nresisting in vain. At the time wt.: did not grasp the terrible<br />\nsignificance of what was happening: we only found out<br />\nlater. They were being taken to the Gulag Archipelago.\"<br />\nTime collection also includes Boll's locture foi the 1972<br />\nNobel Prize in Literature, ossays on Sean O'Casey,<br />\nNorthern Ireland, BrendanBelian, and Bernard Malamud's<br />\nThe Fixer. Generally speaking, those essays dealing with<br />\nRussian nuth ors like Solzhenitsyn, Tolstoi and<br />\nDostoevsky, and those concerning Boll's observations on<br />\nthe Second World War, provide the most interesting<br />\nreading. What, personally, I find the most compelling and<br />\nmemorable essay is \"The Gun Was Aimed at Kafka.\" Bolt<br />\nhappened to bc in Prague in August, 1968 when the<br />\nRussians invaded, and ins account of the events is<br />\nstriking:\"The shot., were live, and numerous, and they<br />\nswept us back twenty-five years and a few months. The<br />\nshots declared categorically: Europe knows no peace, it<br />\nexists in a state of varying armistices. Here, in Prague, an<br />\narmistice was being broken...Outside the building where<br />\nKafka was born stood a tank, its gun barrel aimed at the<br />\nbust of Kafka.\"<br />\nThe Writing Seminars is placing greater emphasis on<br />\nthe media in its spring course offerings, with two<br />\nnewspaper internships and o ic television internship.<br />\nA course given in conjunct!on with the Baltintote<br />\nNews-A merican.

The sensual effects are so strong as to go<br />\nfar beyond a merely decorative function, and must not be<br />\nshrugged off as such. Kubrick is in control throughout the<br />\nfilm, as is evident by the precision of his work: first, the<br />\npure technical quality which exceeds out expectations as<br />\nto touch our imaginations; second, the synchronization of<br />\nassociative artworks within the overall film - the sterile<br />\nsecuality of tile people and their culture as reflected in<br />\ntheir white plastic sculptures and flat, stylised nude<br />\npaintings, their meaningless white and silver \"pop\" decor<br />\nand vynl wardrobes - juxtaposed against an overwhelming<br />\n\u2022 score which gives a sense of vitality so absent from the<br />\nfuturistic culture; and third, Kubrick's successful and<br />\nmeticulous manipulation not only of his medium, but of<br />\nus, the viewers.<br />\nThe film deals with several common ethical theemes in<br />\nan uncommon manner, basically contrastin and<br />\ncomparing Alex, young murderer/rapist/social outcast and a cold futuristic society of mediocre, insipid people.<br />\nIn this context, Alex brings out the same genius of vitality<br />\nas the music that inspires hini; his violence is a relief, as<br />\nwe are hypnotized by the lyrical narration and mehagerie<br />\nof images. In one sense Alex is forced to watch films with<br />\nhis eyelids pinned open. The close-up of his eyes as lie<br />\nstrains to close them is painful to watcn, as it reflects our<br />\nown will and inability to look away from the screen.<br />\nWhat, then, is Kubrick's point? I could hunt out a<br />\nmeaning, bet that would be limiting tile scope of the film.<br />\nThe important thing is to watch the visual themes: the<br />\n/repetitive blank white areas at the back of several shots,<br />\nthe channel-shpaed sets that continually surround Alex,<br />\nthe psychological test he takes near the end which repeats<br />\nOn a small test screen earlier themes. The idea of watching<br />\na film is emphasised within tile film - the audience being,<br />\nconditioned, the director in control, the frame mirroring<br />\nour own situation. Kubrick makes us look, teases as, and.<br />\n,<br />\nraises questions about the roles of control, sex, violence,<br />\nSystems of law, and filmmaking in itself. The pot is not.l.<br />\nKubrick's conclusion, if lie has one sure conclusion; the<br />\nPoint is not what he makes us see but how ne makes us:,<br />\nsee. That is the importance of the film, and the mot,<br />\nsatisfying aspect of it. As Alex says: \"It's funny how the<br />\ncolors of the real world are only seem really real when,<br />\nYou viddy them o,n the screen.\"<br /><br />\nMore Making It<br />\nCOIVTINUED FROM PAGE 8<br />\nThrowing the floor open to questions from the<br />\naudience, Ms. Raskin colunteered opinions on a variety of<br />\ntopics. On the financial future of music in America, and<br />\nits artistic future as well, she refused to categorize<br />\nthe<br />\nsituation as \"bleak.\" Foundations such as the Ford<br />\nfoundation's music programs, and the National<br />\nEndowment for the Arts (on which she srved for four<br />\nYears as chairperson of the opera panel), have oily arisen<br />\nIn the past ten or twelve years. \"We've been through<br />\nbleak; the future will be different.\"<br />\nOn nervousness on stage, she observed that this is ften<br />\na psychological problem; a singer often must develop<br />\nforms of mental protection for himself. \"I tell inysel,,<br />\nI'm OK.'...We tend, as singers, to want to be loved. When<br />\nwe are not loved, we feel rejected.\"<br />\nPeabody's lecture series continues with Jeanne<br />\nRehrend, pianist, discussing and performing American<br />\nPiano music on December 7, and George Mendelssohn de<br />\nHartholdy, President of Vox Records, discussing<br />\n'Musicians and the Recording Industry in America\" on<br /><br />\nDecember 14. Both lectures are at noon in the Peabod<br />\ny<br />\nConcert Hall, and are free to the public.<br />\nIncidentally, these lectures are not the only free<br />\nofferings at Peabody. the concerts of the PeabQd<br />\ny<br />\nOrchestra and othermajor ensembles are free to Hopkin<br />\ns<br />\n(and SAIS, medical institution, and APL) students,<br />\nwho<br />\nmust pick up their tickets at the Information Office<br />\nat 1<br />\nE.

Unfortunately, the film has<br />\nlittle else to offer, and eventually even the photography<br />\n. lapses into what Pauline Kael calls \"calendar art.\"<br />\nKubrick's visual compositions take on the sensationalistic<br />\n;and sometimes erotic character of a calendar on the wall<br />\nof an adolescent who thinks such grotesque distortions of<br />\nthe human condition are, essentially, real.<br />\nIn the movie, Alex, the anti-social punk wit() serves as a<br />\n, hero, is subjected the the LudovicoTreatment, a sort of<br />\nbehavior modification process based on conditioned<br />\nresponses. Kubrick seemingly takes the tack that such<br />\n\"treatment\" is inhuman and despicable. Yet, at the same<br />\ntime, the audience is subjected to the Kubrick Treatment.<br />\nThe audience's response to the movie is shaped by the<br />\nsame psychological theory. For example, when Kubrick<br />\nshows that frolicsome group sex scene sped up to the tune<br />\nof the William Tell Overture, the audience laughs at the<br />\nincongruity between the music (memories of the Lone<br />\nRanger cah't be suspended) and the image. Kubrick is<br />\nplaying on the cinematically induced conditioned<br />\nresponse, just as the Ludivico Treatmentdepends upon<br />\ninstinctively induced conditiohed responses. Alex has a<br />\ndrug which promotes the response; the movie audience<br />\nhas its catalogue of cinematic devices to form a reaction.<br />\nLately I have asked several Kubrick admirers to<br />\nelucidate the theme(s) of A Clockwork Orange. Needless<br />\nto say, no one could give an answer that made much<br />\nsense. \"Well, you know it's political, moral, social,<br />\nreligious, and you know, somethin of everything.\"<br />\nUh-huh. This seems to confirm my suspicions; Kubrick<br />\nhimself doesn't know what he is trying to say. Kubrick<br />\nhas a dim view of modern man, a species seemingly<br />\nincapable of asserting itself by other than violent means.<br />\nTechnology overwhelms the individual in this future.<br />\nKubrick wants to condemn this, but contradicts himself<br />\nbecause he uses cinematic technology to overwhelm the<br />\naudience.<br />\nOverall, A Clockwork Orange is not as great as<br />\neveryone seems to think. The film has a sensationalistic<br />\nquality wortny of tabloid sociology. Every now and then<br />\na movie comes along ahd appeals to the dark side of the<br />\nhuman psyche. Perhaps the Clockwork Orange enthusiasts<br />\nin some way feel guilty about their own repressed<br />\n. violence. For them the film is a catharsis.<br />\nAs thoughts of intersession flicker through<br />\none's acacremic mind, here's a suggestion that might give<br />\nmore breadth to the field of available courses: Mauro's<br />\nMusic.
