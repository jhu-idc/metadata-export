And each year the<br />\nsame bickerings and disputes have broken out, delay proceedings until about two weeks before the finals, when the fear of<br />\nhaving no agreement at. all has driven the delegates into a<br />\nhasty compromise.<br />\nFor the sake of the peace of mind of the campus as a<br />\nwhole, and of members of the Board in particular, we hope<br />\nthat events proceed more smoothly than in the past, although,<br />\nwe have no real reason to think that they will, for conditions<br />\non the campus have changed very little, and human nature not<br />\nat all. However, we wish them success, and at the same time<br />\ntake the liberty to offer a suggestion, which we think is advanced at a most opportune time, for, sinCe the agreement has<br />\nnot been made, and therefore could not have possibly been<br />\nbroken, this suggestion of ours will be based purely on principle.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER would suggest, then, that, whatever type<br />\nof agreement is made, it contains provisions that will insure<br />\nspeedy and severe punishment for all violations.<br />\nOur wish may be bloodthirsty, but it is sincere.<br />\n<br />\nCOMMON SENSE<br />\nThe decision of the June Week Committee to dispense with<br />\n<br />\nan out-of-town orchestra has shared the fate of most departures<br />\nfrom the old way of doing things in that it has evoked quite a<br />\nbit of adverse criticism, from both undergraduates and alumni.<br />\nThere are perhaps some grounds for the opposition to the<br />\nCommittee's policy. It has been argued that the name of a<br />\nnationally famous orchestra would go far toward popularizing<br />\nJune Week, especially among the younger alumni. There is<br />\nalso the consideration that the music furnished by one of the<br />\n\"big\" orchestras might be a trifle more pleasant to dance to,<br />\nbut that seems to carry relatively little weight. The lure of<br />\nthe name, the desire for Hopkins to do things in a \"bigger and<br />\nbetter\" way, are the main factors.<br />\nAll of which is' true enough, if conditions were ideal. But<br />\nsordid and worldly motives have a way of affecting all our<br />\ndecisions. And thus it is at Hopkins; the condition of the student pocket book has quite an influence on the June Week<br />\npolicy.<br />\nJune Week has always been a rather expensive affair, and<br />\nthe largest item of expense has invariably been the out-of-town<br />\n''orchestras.

And each year the<br />\nsame bickerings and disputes have broken out, delay proceedings until about two weeks before the finals, when the fear of<br />\nhaving no agreement at. all has driven the delegates into a<br />\nhasty compromise.<br />\nFor the sake of the peace of mind of the campus as a<br />\nwhole, and of members of the Board in particular, we hope<br />\nthat events proceed more smoothly than in the past, although,<br />\nwe have no real reason to think that they will, for conditions<br />\non the campus have changed very little, and human nature not<br />\nat all. However, we wish them success, and at the same time<br />\ntake the liberty to offer a suggestion, which we think is advanced at a most opportune time, for, sinCe the agreement has<br />\nnot been made, and therefore could not have possibly been<br />\nbroken, this suggestion of ours will be based purely on principle.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER would suggest, then, that, whatever type<br />\nof agreement is made, it contains provisions that will insure<br />\nspeedy and severe punishment for all violations.<br />\nOur wish may be bloodthirsty, but it is sincere.<br /><br />\nCOMMON SENSE<br />\nThe decision of the June Week Committee to dispense with<br /><br />\nan out-of-town orchestra has shared the fate of most departures<br />\nfrom the old way of doing things in that it has evoked quite a<br />\nbit of adverse criticism, from both undergraduates and alumni.<br />\nThere are perhaps some grounds for the opposition to the<br />\nCommittee's policy. It has been argued that the name of a<br />\nnationally famous orchestra would go far toward popularizing<br />\nJune Week, especially among the younger alumni. There is<br />\nalso the consideration that the music furnished by one of the<br />\n\"big\" orchestras might be a trifle more pleasant to dance to,<br />\nbut that seems to carry relatively little weight. The lure of<br />\nthe name, the desire for Hopkins to do things in a \"bigger and<br />\nbetter\" way, are the main factors.<br />\nAll of which is' true enough, if conditions were ideal. But<br />\nsordid and worldly motives have a way of affecting all our<br />\ndecisions. And thus it is at Hopkins; the condition of the student pocket book has quite an influence on the June Week<br />\npolicy.<br />\nJune Week has always been a rather expensive affair, and<br />\nthe largest item of expense has invariably been the out-of-town<br />\n''orchestras.
