Special articles on the<br />\nriot were printed in the news<br />\nmagazines, with a special picture<br />\nstory appearing in Life, Since<br />\nthen, a group of Yale students<br />\nhave been collecting news stories,<br />\nreports<br />\nphotos,<br />\non-the-scene<br />\nfrom eye-witnesses and other<br />\nmaterial concerning the now<br />\nfamous riot. The information<br />\nclearly indicates that the disturbance was not instigated by<br />\nYale students, but by the New<br />\nHaven police themselves.<br />\nThis information appears for<br />\nthe first time here in the Johns<br />\nHopkins News-Letter since these<br />\nstudents feel that any attempt to<br />\nprint such material in the Yale<br />\nDaily News might lead to reprisal by the Yale administration.<br />\nThe facts of the riot itself are<br />\nrelatively simple.<br />\nTwo days later, on March 15<br />\nthe New Haven St. Patrick's Day<br />\nthe<br />\nthrough<br />\nwound<br />\nparade<br />\nmiddle of Yale. There was no<br />\ntrouble during the celebration,<br />\nbut later on, as the marchers<br />\nwere returning along the route<br />\nof the parade, a fracas occured<br />\nthe<br />\nbetween policemen and<br />\nYalies.<br />\nThe police charged into the<br />\ncrowd of Yalies with night-sticks<br />\nand revolvers drawn, clubbing<br />\neveryone in front of them. Many<br />\nYalies were clubbed as they fled<br />\nto the sanctuary of the Calhoun<br />\nCollege courtyard.<br />\n'According to William Emerson.<br />\nAssistant Professor of History at<br />\nYale, the students put up no<br />\nresistance to the police attack.<br />\nAs is usual in Yale riots, the<br />\ncollege gates were quickly locked<br />\nfrom the inside, but this did not<br />\nstop the intrepid policemen; they.<br />\nbroke down the gates and<br />\nswarmed onto the Yale campus<br />\ncarrying with them many townspeople who had been watching<br />\nthe parade a short time earlier.<br />\nMost of those who were<br />\nclubbed and/or arrested had<br />\nnothing whatever to do with the<br />\nprevious action, but were merely<br />\ndisinterested onlookers. One of<br />\nthe fleeing Yalies dropped his<br />\nglasses in flight and was Struck<br />\nfrom behind by two policemen<br />\nas he bent down to pick them<br />\nup. He required eight stitches. A<br />\n69-year-old Sterling Professor of<br />\nHistory was struck on the head,<br />\nby a night-stick.<br />\nSenator Prescott Bush and his<br />\nson had been observing the parade from across the street. An<br />\noffices. crossed the street and<br />\nstruck the younger Bush on the<br />\nhead and had him charted off in<br />\nthe wagon. Another policeman<br />\non the Yale campus missed the<br />\nYalie for whom he was aiming<br />\nand struck a nine-year-old girl<br />\nwho had been carried in with the<br />\ninflux of onlookers. The attacked<br />\nYale student picked up the profusely bleeding child and carried<br />\nher outside of the gates, where<br />\nanother policeman attempted to<br />\nstrike him down.<br />\nOf the 16 students that were<br />\narrested, several were beaten<br />\nseverely in the paddy-wagon on<br />\nthe way to the station; in one<br />\ncase the police van reportedly<br />\nstopped so that the officers could<br />\nstudents a more<br />\ngive the<br />\nthorough working over in an<br />\nalley.<br />\nThe physical beating the policemen gave the arrested students, however, was no worse<br />\n<br />\nthan the reputational black eye of anti-Yale publicity and unthat the Yellow Press gave the mentioned police brutality is the<br />\nstudent body as a whole.<br />\nbasic mystery of how the riot<br />\nThe New Haven Register, the began in the first place.

The most important quality in a<br />\nroom-mate is that he should be exactly your size. Otherwise<br />\nyou will have to have his clothes altered tO fit you, which can<br />\nbe a considerable nuisance. In fact, it is sometimes flatly inPossible. I recollect one time I roomed with a man named<br />\nOsage Treiiiblatt who was just under seven feet tall and weighed<br />\nnearly four hundred pounds. There wasn't a blessed thing I<br />\ncould use in his entire wardrobe\u2014until one night when I was<br />\nInvited to a masquerade party. I cut one leg off a pair of TremWatt's trousers, jumped into it, sewed up both ends, and went<br />\ntO the party as a bolster. I took second prize. First prize went<br />\nto a girl named Antenna Itadnitz who poured molasses over<br />\nlier head and went as a candied apple.<br />\nBut I digress. Let its turn back to the qualities that make<br />\ndesirable room-mates. Not the least of these is the cigarettes<br />\nthey smoke. When we bum cigarettes, do we want them to be<br />\nshoddy and nondescript? Certainly not! We want them to be<br />\ndistinguished, gently reared, zestful and zingy. And what cigarette is distinguished, gently reared, zestful and zingy? Why,<br />\nPhilip Morris, of corns! Any further questions?<br />\nTo go on.

The information<br />\nclearly indicates that the disturbance was not instigated by<br />\nYale students, but by the New<br />\nHaven police themselves.<br />\nThis information appears for<br />\nthe first time here in the Johns<br />\nHopkins News-Letter since these<br />\nstudents feel that any attempt to<br />\nprint such material in the Yale<br />\nDaily News might lead to reprisal by the Yale administration.<br />\nThe facts of the riot itself are<br />\nrelatively simple.<br />\nTwo days later, on March 15<br />\nthe New Haven St. Patrick's Day<br />\nthe<br />\nthrough<br />\nwound<br />\nparade<br />\nmiddle of Yale. There was no<br />\ntrouble during the celebration,<br />\nbut later on, as the marchers<br />\nwere returning along the route<br />\nof the parade, a fracas occured<br />\nthe<br />\nbetween policemen and<br />\nYalies.<br />\nThe police charged into the<br />\ncrowd of Yalies with night-sticks<br />\nand revolvers drawn, clubbing<br />\neveryone in front of them. Many<br />\nYalies were clubbed as they fled<br />\nto the sanctuary of the Calhoun<br />\nCollege courtyard.<br />\n'According to William Emerson.<br />\nAssistant Professor of History at<br />\nYale, the students put up no<br />\nresistance to the police attack.<br />\nAs is usual in Yale riots, the<br />\ncollege gates were quickly locked<br />\nfrom the inside, but this did not<br />\nstop the intrepid policemen; they.<br />\nbroke down the gates and<br />\nswarmed onto the Yale campus<br />\ncarrying with them many townspeople who had been watching<br />\nthe parade a short time earlier.<br />\nMost of those who were<br />\nclubbed and/or arrested had<br />\nnothing whatever to do with the<br />\nprevious action, but were merely<br />\ndisinterested onlookers. One of<br />\nthe fleeing Yalies dropped his<br />\nglasses in flight and was Struck<br />\nfrom behind by two policemen<br />\nas he bent down to pick them<br />\nup. He required eight stitches. A<br />\n69-year-old Sterling Professor of<br />\nHistory was struck on the head,<br />\nby a night-stick.<br />\nSenator Prescott Bush and his<br />\nson had been observing the parade from across the street. An<br />\noffices. crossed the street and<br />\nstruck the younger Bush on the<br />\nhead and had him charted off in<br />\nthe wagon. Another policeman<br />\non the Yale campus missed the<br />\nYalie for whom he was aiming<br />\nand struck a nine-year-old girl<br />\nwho had been carried in with the<br />\ninflux of onlookers. The attacked<br />\nYale student picked up the profusely bleeding child and carried<br />\nher outside of the gates, where<br />\nanother policeman attempted to<br />\nstrike him down.<br />\nOf the 16 students that were<br />\narrested, several were beaten<br />\nseverely in the paddy-wagon on<br />\nthe way to the station; in one<br />\ncase the police van reportedly<br />\nstopped so that the officers could<br />\nstudents a more<br />\ngive the<br />\nthorough working over in an<br />\nalley.<br />\nThe physical beating the policemen gave the arrested students, however, was no worse<br /><br />\nthan the reputational black eye of anti-Yale publicity and unthat the Yellow Press gave the mentioned police brutality is the<br />\nstudent body as a whole.<br />\nbasic mystery of how the riot<br />\nThe New Haven Register, the began in the first place.

The most important quality in a<br />\nroom-mate is that he should be exactly your size. Otherwise<br />\nyou will have to have his clothes altered tO fit you, which can<br />\nbe a considerable nuisance. In fact, it is sometimes flatly inPossible. I recollect one time I roomed with a man named<br />\nOsage Treiiiblatt who was just under seven feet tall and weighed<br />\nnearly four hundred pounds. There wasn't a blessed thing I<br />\ncould use in his entire wardrobe\u2014until one night when I was<br />\nInvited to a masquerade party. I cut one leg off a pair of TremWatt's trousers, jumped into it, sewed up both ends, and went<br />\ntO the party as a bolster. I took second prize. First prize went<br />\nto a girl named Antenna Itadnitz who poured molasses over<br />\nlier head and went as a candied apple.<br />\nBut I digress. Let its turn back to the qualities that make<br />\ndesirable room-mates. Not the least of these is the cigarettes<br />\nthey smoke. When we bum cigarettes, do we want them to be<br />\nshoddy and nondescript? Certainly not! We want them to be<br />\ndistinguished, gently reared, zestful and zingy. And what cigarette is distinguished, gently reared, zestful and zingy? Why,<br />\nPhilip Morris, of corns! Any further questions?<br />\nTo go on.
