Christine Ladd was<br />\nhorn in Winsor, Conn., December<br />\nr, 1847, of a long line of. Puritan<br />\nancestry. She graduated from Vassar near the head of the brilliaat<br />\nclass of '69, and in 1878 came to<br />\nthe Hopkins to carry on graduate<br />\nwork in mathematics.- In those<br />\ndays it was an unheard of thing in<br />\nthis country for a woman to pursue<br />\npost-graduate studies, and even<br />\nhere at the new University which<br />\nwas introducing so many innovations into the American system of<br />\neducation, no degree was open to<br />\nher. Nevertheless, Miss Ladd remained here four' years, and was<br />\na prominent figure in the life of the<br />\nUniversity. Iier ability soon attracted recognition. One who turns<br />\nover the files of the University Circular for those years will often<br />\nfind her name; and in the issue for<br />\nDecember, 1879, and again in that<br />\nfor January, 1881, he will also find<br />\na notice printed in small type and<br />\nappended to the roll of Fellows.<br />\nThe notice reads:<br />\n<br />\nnew edition which is just from the<br />\npress.

Permit me<br />\nto subscribe the following statement which, I trust, will exonerate<br />\nthe ushers\u2022of manifestly unwarranted charges.<br />\nThe details of this incident, which<br />\nthe modest \"Spectator\" has endeavored to furnish with minute<br />\naccuracy, have on the other hand<br />\nbeen grossly distorted and 'hopelessly exaggerated. The only apparent disturbance occurred during<br />\nthe course of the second speaker's<br />\nremarks, when some one, who<br />\nchanced to be sitting with the<br />\nushers, but not himself an usher,<br />\nbegan to engage in a succession of<br />\nmirth-provoking remarks, and continued to such an extent that the<br />\nalumnus mentioned was twice obliged to request the garrulous one<br />\nto be quiet.<br />\nThe occurrence was most unfortunate, and no one regretted it<br />\nmore than I ; but I wish it clearly<br />\nunderstood that the ushers are not<br />\nthe subjects for censure.

Christine Ladd was<br />\nhorn in Winsor, Conn., December<br />\nr, 1847, of a long line of. Puritan<br />\nancestry. She graduated from Vassar near the head of the brilliaat<br />\nclass of '69, and in 1878 came to<br />\nthe Hopkins to carry on graduate<br />\nwork in mathematics.- In those<br />\ndays it was an unheard of thing in<br />\nthis country for a woman to pursue<br />\npost-graduate studies, and even<br />\nhere at the new University which<br />\nwas introducing so many innovations into the American system of<br />\neducation, no degree was open to<br />\nher. Nevertheless, Miss Ladd remained here four' years, and was<br />\na prominent figure in the life of the<br />\nUniversity. Iier ability soon attracted recognition. One who turns<br />\nover the files of the University Circular for those years will often<br />\nfind her name; and in the issue for<br />\nDecember, 1879, and again in that<br />\nfor January, 1881, he will also find<br />\na notice printed in small type and<br />\nappended to the roll of Fellows.<br />\nThe notice reads:<br /><br />\nnew edition which is just from the<br />\npress.

Permit me<br />\nto subscribe the following statement which, I trust, will exonerate<br />\nthe ushers\u2022of manifestly unwarranted charges.<br />\nThe details of this incident, which<br />\nthe modest \"Spectator\" has endeavored to furnish with minute<br />\naccuracy, have on the other hand<br />\nbeen grossly distorted and 'hopelessly exaggerated. The only apparent disturbance occurred during<br />\nthe course of the second speaker's<br />\nremarks, when some one, who<br />\nchanced to be sitting with the<br />\nushers, but not himself an usher,<br />\nbegan to engage in a succession of<br />\nmirth-provoking remarks, and continued to such an extent that the<br />\nalumnus mentioned was twice obliged to request the garrulous one<br />\nto be quiet.<br />\nThe occurrence was most unfortunate, and no one regretted it<br />\nmore than I ; but I wish it clearly<br />\nunderstood that the ushers are not<br />\nthe subjects for censure. I hope,<br />\nalso, that the offended alumnus will<br />\nrecognize his error, and will never<br />\nhave occasion to feel aught but<br />\npride for his alma mater..<br />\n\u2022<br />\nVery truly yours, .<br />\nHAROLD B.
