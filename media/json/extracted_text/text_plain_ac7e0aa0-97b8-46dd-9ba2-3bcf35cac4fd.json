The University is yet beginning to overtake such comparable<br />\ncolleges as Williams, Amherst and Swarthmore in this field.<br />\nThe facilities of the department are still limited, and the list<br />\nof lecturers is not large. But rather than fill its staff with permanent but perhaps inadequate members, it has relied on importing<br />\ndistinguished authorities each term as 'visiting lecturers. In its<br />\ncurriculum, the department has once again satisfied itself with a<br />\nfew top-grade courses, rather than a mass of mediocre ones.<br />\nThe dynamic character of the new department is not merely<br />\nthe reflection of a trend. To a great extent it results from the<br />\ninterest of its Direetor, Dr. Richard H. Howland in integrating<br />\nart with other humanities and at times engineering courses. This<br />\neffort has givemothe Art Department a relative uniqueness in a<br />\nUniversity which bases its strength almost entirely on the individual, often is6lated departments.<br />\nOne of the first attempts at integrating art with other courses<br />\nwas -Dr Hans Gatke's use of an illustrated lecture on 18th and<br />\n19th century painting given by Dr Howland in the History 3-4<br />\nsurvey course. While the lecture was to all extent concerned with<br />\npurely artistic trends, it was much more than an aesthetic work-out.<br />\nThere was a definite attempt made to correlate art with the leading<br />\npolitical movements of the era and the success of this single experisrnent has contributed to the continued concern of the .department<br />\nfor integration with allied fietds. . Recognizing the danger of the department's retreating into. a<br />\nshell, Di. Howland has further. expressed his interest by introducing the Art Department into still other fields as well as the local<br />\ncommunity. The department has already begun work with the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art and intends to-further increase this effort. Perhaps its most notable recent achievment has been its<br />\nlimited integration with 'The engineering school. A Mechanical<br />\n.Drawing course for pre-architectural students has been created<br />\nwhich is jointly operated by both departments.<br />\nTo the humanities students disappointed with the liberal arts<br />\ncurriculum., the Arts Department presents a refreshingly vital<br />\noutlook. Though burdened with inadequate facilities and meager<br />\nfunds it is nevertheless progressing and has refused to restrict<br />\nitself to the confines of the first floor of Gilman.<br />\nThe coordination of the individual humanities departments<br />\nto ptevent overlappings and give the liberal arts student a more<br />\ncomplete background has not come from an inter-departmental<br />\nadministrative unit, but will rather come from independent depart mental leadership. And, as in the Art Department, it must be<br />\ncharacterized by a . deliberate concern for the integration of the<br />\ndepartment with the allied fields of the University.<br />\n<br />\nbys in trench-fighting, convoytruck-driving,\u2022 and sniper-warfare<br />\nuntil finally, by early 1949, Israel was victorious.

This Spring is no exception. The team<br />\nhas won one me (on one hit and a host of errors) and the chances<br />\nare very slim against their winning any more. Wha hoppon I<br />\nWHAT CAN. BE WRONG?<br />\nEach year these same Jay fans eliminate one of the variables<br />\nthat go to make a baseball club in the hopes that the following<br />\nseason they can come up with d winner. Two years ago they made<br />\nit a major sport and gave them a full set of uniforms. Last year<br />\nthey lost the old coach, only to find that the new one couldn't win<br />\neither.<br />\nSince this appears to rank with the riddle of the sphinx and<br />\nsince I can't be any more wrong than the next guy, I am going<br />\nto try to give a few reasons why the 1949 Jay baseball team can<br />\nnot win ball games.<br />\nProbably the main factor is that it is still, in spite of the size<br />\nof the letter awarded, a minor sport. All the schools on the Jay<br />\nslate consider the game a No 1 sport. All their energies and money<br />\nand enthusiasm go into it. At Hopkins, the baseballers get leftovers, from fans to equipment.<br />\n(Continued on Page 7)<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n.30141sTOHS<br />\nElikVID<br />\nDRIVE WASTItAED<br />\nAT 184 FEET PP.R.<br />\nSECOND .13EITER THAN<br />\n2MILES A MINUTE.\u00b0<br />\n<br />\nCHAMPIONSHIP<br />\nTENNIS TWINS<br />\n<br />\nim9itson<br />\n<br />\n'.4.\u2022 r<br />\n.<br />\n0..\u2022<br />\nm\u2022<br />\n.- CHAMPIONSHIP<br />\n'\u2022,4,<br />\n:\u2022 AK U.s.Lta...wocs. cOVIR<br />\nV\u2022;.1.7<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u202214..,<br />\n.?<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 .. ,.' -<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 ,...<br />\n. .<br />\n<br />\n.44,...,4,-.\u2022 -.ei.rr 4.\u2022 S<br />\n-. .

The University is yet beginning to overtake such comparable<br />\ncolleges as Williams, Amherst and Swarthmore in this field.<br />\nThe facilities of the department are still limited, and the list<br />\nof lecturers is not large. But rather than fill its staff with permanent but perhaps inadequate members, it has relied on importing<br />\ndistinguished authorities each term as 'visiting lecturers. In its<br />\ncurriculum, the department has once again satisfied itself with a<br />\nfew top-grade courses, rather than a mass of mediocre ones.<br />\nThe dynamic character of the new department is not merely<br />\nthe reflection of a trend. To a great extent it results from the<br />\ninterest of its Direetor, Dr. Richard H. Howland in integrating<br />\nart with other humanities and at times engineering courses. This<br />\neffort has givemothe Art Department a relative uniqueness in a<br />\nUniversity which bases its strength almost entirely on the individual, often is6lated departments.<br />\nOne of the first attempts at integrating art with other courses<br />\nwas -Dr Hans Gatke's use of an illustrated lecture on 18th and<br />\n19th century painting given by Dr Howland in the History 3-4<br />\nsurvey course. While the lecture was to all extent concerned with<br />\npurely artistic trends, it was much more than an aesthetic work-out.<br />\nThere was a definite attempt made to correlate art with the leading<br />\npolitical movements of the era and the success of this single experisrnent has contributed to the continued concern of the .department<br />\nfor integration with allied fietds. . Recognizing the danger of the department's retreating into. a<br />\nshell, Di. Howland has further. expressed his interest by introducing the Art Department into still other fields as well as the local<br />\ncommunity. The department has already begun work with the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art and intends to-further increase this effort. Perhaps its most notable recent achievment has been its<br />\nlimited integration with 'The engineering school. A Mechanical<br />\n.Drawing course for pre-architectural students has been created<br />\nwhich is jointly operated by both departments.<br />\nTo the humanities students disappointed with the liberal arts<br />\ncurriculum., the Arts Department presents a refreshingly vital<br />\noutlook. Though burdened with inadequate facilities and meager<br />\nfunds it is nevertheless progressing and has refused to restrict<br />\nitself to the confines of the first floor of Gilman.<br />\nThe coordination of the individual humanities departments<br />\nto ptevent overlappings and give the liberal arts student a more<br />\ncomplete background has not come from an inter-departmental<br />\nadministrative unit, but will rather come from independent depart mental leadership. And, as in the Art Department, it must be<br />\ncharacterized by a . deliberate concern for the integration of the<br />\ndepartment with the allied fields of the University.<br /><br />\nbys in trench-fighting, convoytruck-driving,\u2022 and sniper-warfare<br />\nuntil finally, by early 1949, Israel was victorious.
