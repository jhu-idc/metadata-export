The \u201cpayment in lieu of taxes\u201d, if reckoned<br />\nas 10% of the ordinary shelter rent of $118,245,<br />\nwould be $11,825 (see Appendix M). The latest<br />\npayment (for 1944) is greater because the<br />\ntenants\u2019 earnings are (temporarily) greater, and<br />\nstands at $16,216 (see Appendix K) instead of<br />\n$11,825. However, these payments depend on the<br />\npolicy of the F.P.H.A., which may be changed as<br />\nthat Authority sees fit, and presumably the pay-<br />\nments will presently diminish. Nevertheless' we<br />\nfollow here the figures of Appendix K, except that<br />\nwe take the 1945 rate of City taxation since that<br />\nis used in our other comparable calculations. The<br />\nCity taxes on the property\u2019 at the present tax-<br />\nassessed value of $2,395,390, in Appendix K, at<br />\nthe 1945 rate for the City of .0289, would be<br />\n<br />\n$69,227. Subtracting the payment in lieu of<br />\ntaxes, $16,216, the City subsidizes the project<br />\nby $53,011. The State taxes at .0012 would be<br />\n$2,874.

The sum of<br />\nthese subsidies is $120,097 per year for at least<br />\nthe 60 years of life of the project, or in total<br />\n$7,205,820. This works out as $53.57 per year<br />\nper head of the inhabitants. If the project turns<br />\nover its assets at the end of 60 years to the City,<br />\nthe public subsidy would thus be reduced to about<br />\n$51.48 per head per year (see Table 35).<br />\nFurther, the above figures do not quite com-<br />\npletely explain the full amount of the subsidy.<br />\nA proportionate part of the overhead and salaries<br />\nof the Housing Authority of Baltimore City is<br />\nnot itemized, nor a similar apportionment of the<br />\n<br />\nexpenses of the Federal Public Housing Authority<br />\n<br />\nin Washington and in the field. We do not know<br />\nwhat these figures are, and do not attempt to<br />\nestimate them, but they are presumably consider-<br />\nable. It is, we believe, assumed that part or all<br />\nof these expenses will be covered by the difference<br />\nbetween the rate of interest which the Govern-<br />\nment pays on its borrowings and the rate at which<br />\nit lends money to the Housing Authority. Even<br />\nso, this sum remains a payment toward mainten-<br />\nance and management to be considered in com-<br />\nparing these projects with other alternatives.<br />\nFurthermore, the bonds of the Baltimore Hous-<br />\ning Authority are entirely tax-exempt.
