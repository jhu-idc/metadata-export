Although<br />\nthis is certainly a lamentable fact, especially for grad<br />\nstudents, in some ways it sounds more equitable than<br />\nthe present system. According to statistics presented at<br />\nthe case study on Hopkins last week, the school gives<br />\n52.6 million in aid to grad students, and $750,000 to<br />\nundergraduates. When all the money from the federal<br />\ngovernment and foundations is counted in, graduate<br />\nfinancial assistance totals $4 million, while<br />\nundergraduates get $3 million. To top the whole<br />\nsystem off, Vice President George Benton maintained<br />\nthat it was the undergraduate program that generated<br />\nmore money for the school than the graduate one.<br />\nIt seems only fair that the University contribute<br />\nmore financial assistance to those students who are<br />\nproviding Hopkins with more revenue. Perhaps the<br />\nUniversity should seek more revenue from the<br />\ngraduate students who hold a more elevated status at<br />\nHopkins. By relying on the money of upper-middle<br />\nclass undergraduates, the University is forced<br />\nultimately to reject qualified students who cannot<br />\nafford a Hopkins education without financial<br />\nassistance. There are graduate students presently<br />\nenrolled who receive aid on the basis of academic<br />\nperformance despite the fact that they could afford to<br />\ncontribute to their fees.

In an early scene high<br />\nschool-aged Sonny (Timothy Bottoms),<br />\nthe central character, goes to the picture<br />\nshow. He sits down with his blank-faced,<br />\ngum-chewing girlfriend, and we know<br />\nimmediately that he has been growing<br />\nincreasingly bored with her.

In a way,it is<br />\nfunctional, since we realize after a while<br />\nthat much of the chatter isn't worth<br />\nhearing, that it's just another sound<br />\namong the chorus of droning radios and<br />\njukeboxes.<br />\nIn any case, these are minor quibbles<br />\nwhen placed against the convincing<br />\nspectrum of small town life which is laid<br />\nout before us. The casting is consistently<br />\nsuperb, from Bottoms, who looks<br />\ncheerful and wholesome, yet has a deep<br />\nstrain of melancholy underneath (rather<br />\nlike an ethereal Ryan O'Neal) to a<br />\nsharp-tongued waitress, a simpering rich<br />\nboy and a fat S1.50-a-throw whore. The<br />\nacting and writing are good in the few<br />\ndramatic outbursts, but their quality is<br />\nmore evident in the smaller moments:<br />\nscenes of people fumbling for words of<br />\ngratitude or forgiving friends for past<br />\ncruelties are always much harder to stage<br />\nconvincingly.<br />\nThe direction is generally spare. Some<br />\ntouches are rather jazzy, such as a cut<br />\nfrom a young couple squabbling in a<br />\nmotel room to the graduating seniors<br />\nsinging a sort of \"Texas, Texas, uber<br />\nalles\" anthem.<br />\nBut a few gimmicks impede only<br />\nslightly Bogdanovich's pointed<br />\nexamination of Anarene's and our own<br />\ntownsmen stand over his body discussing lack of heroes. I add \"our own\" because<br />\nthe boy's stupidity in their monotonous \"The Last Picture Show\" should strike us<br />\ndrawls. Sonny screams at them, carries as more than a period piece, living as we<br />\nthe body over to the sidewalk and drives do in an era when we see the Olympics<br />\npackaged into ten-minute, filmed<br />\nfuriously out of town. The countryside<br />\nprovides no means of escape. It is as segments and filtered through the<br />\ncolorless and monotonous as the town. perceptions of Curt Gowdy, and<br />\nSonny simply turns around and heads suburban he-men spend their Saturday<br />\nback. perhaps because he doesn't know afternoons commandeering their ride-'em<br />\nwhat else to do, perhaps because he lawn mowers around the backyard.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letter/march 21, 1972<br />\n<br />\nNO MORE PENCILS,NO MORE BOOKS,<br />\nNO MORE TEACH S'DIRTY LOOKS.<br />\n<br />\nTWA INTRODUCES THE 1972<br />\nGETAWAY*PROGRAM.<br />\nThis ad wasn't written to amuse you.

But Yale would not<br />\ngive up, and by the end of the<br />\nthird period they led 8-6,<br />\nnecessitating the Hopkins<br />\n<br />\ncomeback.<br />\nThe Eli 7-1 scoring margin in<br />\nthis 28 minute stretch belies an<br />\noverwhelming control that did<br />\nnot actually exist. Play went up<br />\nand down the field with neither<br />\nteam retaining posession very<br />\nlong. In fact, during this time.<br />\nHopkins outshot Yale 27-19. Eli<br />\ngoalie Bing Gordon, however,<br />\nproved the difference as his<br />\npositioning continually cut off<br />\naccess to the scoreboard. He<br />\nturned aside 20 shots in the<br />\ngame, including 13 saves in this<br />\nstretch.<br />\nFrustrated<br />\nThe Bulldog defense further<br />\nfrustrated Hopkins as Larry<br />\nStory and Larry Fox both played<br />\noutstanding games. They<br />\neffectively stymied the Blue Jays<br />\n<br />\nwhen both teams were at full<br />\nstrength in the Yale zone. It was<br />\nonly while breaking clears, in<br />\nextra man situations, and on fast<br />\nbreaks that Hopkins managed to<br />\ndo well offensively.. The visitors<br />\nscored first when Tom Fagan<br />\nscooped the ball in a scrap at the<br />\nrestraining line and pTomptly fed<br />\nPete Tarr for an easy goal. Within<br />\n30 seconds Don Krohn tied the<br />\nscore for Hopkins, netting a Dave<br />\nNelz rebound.<br />\nTurning Point<br />\nThe turning point of the game<br />\ncame when Yale was penalized<br />\nfor holding with 23 seconds left<br />\nin the third quarter. Hopkins<br />\nplayed out the peroid with the<br />\nman advantage, but was unable<br />\nto set up a score. Moments after<br />\n<br />\nthe fourth period started another<br />\nYale penalty gave Hopkins more<br />\npower play time. Kowalchuk<br />\nearned his hat trick almost<br />\nimmediately on a perfect shot to<br />\nthe lower corner past Gordon's<br />\nankle. Within minutes Ken<br />\nWinegrad scored to tie the game<br />\nat 8 apiece. Midway through the<br />\nperiod, on another power play,<br />\nKrohn cut to the crease and<br />\nscored the winning goal on a feed<br />\n<br />\nfrom Thomas.<br />\nIn the final minutes of the<br />\ngame Hopkins tried to stall while<br />\nYale managed several offensiye<br />\nrushes. Outstanding defensive<br />\nplays by Jim Head and Joe<br />\nCieslowski saved the win for the<br />\nBlue Jays.<br />\nToday Hopkins faces Hobart<br />\nCollege here at 4 pm in the last<br />\nscrimmage of the pre-season<br />\nschedule.<br />\n<br />\nWe've got the guts<br />\nto take on competition.<br />\nJeep guts.<br />\n<br />\nJay mermen 6th in nation<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nswim team and head coach Frank<br />\nComfort continued their climb to<br />\nnational prominence last<br />\nweekend with a sixth-place finish<br />\nin the college division<br />\nchampionship at Washington and<br />\nLee.

According to statistics presented at<br />\nthe case study on Hopkins last week, the school gives<br />\n52.6 million in aid to grad students, and $750,000 to<br />\nundergraduates.

Perhaps the<br />\nUniversity should seek more revenue from the<br />\ngraduate students who hold a more elevated status at<br />\nHopkins. By relying on the money of upper-middle<br />\nclass undergraduates, the University is forced<br />\nultimately to reject qualified students who cannot<br />\nafford a Hopkins education without financial<br />\nassistance. There are graduate students presently<br />\nenrolled who receive aid on the basis of academic<br />\nperformance despite the fact that they could afford to<br />\ncontribute to their fees.

In an early scene high<br />\nschool-aged Sonny (Timothy Bottoms),<br />\nthe central character, goes to the picture<br />\nshow. He sits down with his blank-faced,<br />\ngum-chewing girlfriend, and we know<br />\nimmediately that he has been growing<br />\nincreasingly bored with her. She is<br /><br />\ncertainly no match for the gorgeous<br />\nElizabeth Taylor, on-screen in \"Father of<br />\nthe Bride.\"<br />\nAfter the show they go parking. It's<br />\nnot so much that they want to go, as that<br />\nit's what they do every Saturday night;<br />\nit's absolutely all there is to do.

He is the only<br />\nperson in Anarene with a moral code and<br />\nthe only one who can even remember<br />\nwhat it's like to be doing something<br />\nexciting.

I don't<br />\nsubscribe to this theory: \"Bonnie and<br />\nClyde\" was shot in color, and the<br />\nlandscape of drab browns and dreary,<br />\nburned-out greens and yellows was<br />\neloquent. Also, whether because of the<br />\nsoundtrack or the drawls, much of the<br />\nsmall talk is incoherent. This, however,<br />\nmay have been intentional. In a way,it is<br />\nfunctional, since we realize after a while<br />\nthat much of the chatter isn't worth<br />\nhearing, that it's just another sound<br />\namong the chorus of droning radios and<br />\njukeboxes.<br />\nIn any case, these are minor quibbles<br />\nwhen placed against the convincing<br />\nspectrum of small town life which is laid<br />\nout before us. The casting is consistently<br />\nsuperb, from Bottoms, who looks<br />\ncheerful and wholesome, yet has a deep<br />\nstrain of melancholy underneath (rather<br />\nlike an ethereal Ryan O'Neal) to a<br />\nsharp-tongued waitress, a simpering rich<br />\nboy and a fat S1.50-a-throw whore. The<br />\nacting and writing are good in the few<br />\ndramatic outbursts, but their quality is<br />\nmore evident in the smaller moments:<br />\nscenes of people fumbling for words of<br />\ngratitude or forgiving friends for past<br />\ncruelties are always much harder to stage<br />\nconvincingly.<br />\nThe direction is generally spare. Some<br />\ntouches are rather jazzy, such as a cut<br />\nfrom a young couple squabbling in a<br />\nmotel room to the graduating seniors<br />\nsinging a sort of \"Texas, Texas, uber<br />\nalles\" anthem.<br />\nBut a few gimmicks impede only<br />\nslightly Bogdanovich's pointed<br />\nexamination of Anarene's and our own<br />\ntownsmen stand over his body discussing lack of heroes. I add \"our own\" because<br />\nthe boy's stupidity in their monotonous \"The Last Picture Show\" should strike us<br />\ndrawls. Sonny screams at them, carries as more than a period piece, living as we<br />\nthe body over to the sidewalk and drives do in an era when we see the Olympics<br />\npackaged into ten-minute, filmed<br />\nfuriously out of town.

But Yale would not<br />\ngive up, and by the end of the<br />\nthird period they led 8-6,<br />\nnecessitating the Hopkins<br /><br />\ncomeback.<br />\nThe Eli 7-1 scoring margin in<br />\nthis 28 minute stretch belies an<br />\noverwhelming control that did<br />\nnot actually exist. Play went up<br />\nand down the field with neither<br />\nteam retaining posession very<br />\nlong. In fact, during this time.<br />\nHopkins outshot Yale 27-19. Eli<br />\ngoalie Bing Gordon, however,<br />\nproved the difference as his<br />\npositioning continually cut off<br />\naccess to the scoreboard. He<br />\nturned aside 20 shots in the<br />\ngame, including 13 saves in this<br />\nstretch.<br />\nFrustrated<br />\nThe Bulldog defense further<br />\nfrustrated Hopkins as Larry<br />\nStory and Larry Fox both played<br />\noutstanding games. They<br />\neffectively stymied the Blue Jays<br /><br />\nwhen both teams were at full<br />\nstrength in the Yale zone. It was<br />\nonly while breaking clears, in<br />\nextra man situations, and on fast<br />\nbreaks that Hopkins managed to<br />\ndo well offensively.. The visitors<br />\nscored first when Tom Fagan<br />\nscooped the ball in a scrap at the<br />\nrestraining line and pTomptly fed<br />\nPete Tarr for an easy goal. Within<br />\n30 seconds Don Krohn tied the<br />\nscore for Hopkins, netting a Dave<br />\nNelz rebound.<br />\nTurning Point<br />\nThe turning point of the game<br />\ncame when Yale was penalized<br />\nfor holding with 23 seconds left<br />\nin the third quarter. Hopkins<br />\nplayed out the peroid with the<br />\nman advantage, but was unable<br />\nto set up a score. Moments after<br /><br />\nthe fourth period started another<br />\nYale penalty gave Hopkins more<br />\npower play time. Kowalchuk<br />\nearned his hat trick almost<br />\nimmediately on a perfect shot to<br />\nthe lower corner past Gordon's<br />\nankle. Within minutes Ken<br />\nWinegrad scored to tie the game<br />\nat 8 apiece. Midway through the<br />\nperiod, on another power play,<br />\nKrohn cut to the crease and<br />\nscored the winning goal on a feed<br /><br />\nfrom Thomas.<br />\nIn the final minutes of the<br />\ngame Hopkins tried to stall while<br />\nYale managed several offensiye<br />\nrushes. Outstanding defensive<br />\nplays by Jim Head and Joe<br />\nCieslowski saved the win for the<br />\nBlue Jays.<br />\nToday Hopkins faces Hobart<br />\nCollege here at 4 pm in the last<br />\nscrimmage of the pre-season<br />\nschedule.<br /><br />\nWe've got the guts<br />\nto take on competition.<br />\nJeep guts.<br /><br />\nJay mermen 6th in nation<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nswim team and head coach Frank<br />\nComfort continued their climb to<br />\nnational prominence last<br />\nweekend with a sixth-place finish<br />\nin the college division<br />\nchampionship at Washington and<br />\nLee.
