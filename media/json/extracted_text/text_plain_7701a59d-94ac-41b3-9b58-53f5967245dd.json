In other words, a reviewer, whether,<br />\nhe is a professional or amateur, is no more than a retail merchant. No matter<br />\nwho the merchant and no matter what his price, the final say, of course, lies<br />\nwith the reader. This amounts to a personal apology to Karl Shapiro for<br />\nreviewing his poems; for he maintains to his poetry falls \"the task of<br />\ndestroying the government of critics and of making a wholesale return to<br />\nthe anarchy of experience.\"<br />\nI don't think Mr Shapiro really means what he says. He does not<br />\ndirect his hatred against all critics, but only a particular class of critics<br />\nwho would chop his poetry up and lay it out beside their carefully measured, but rather worn out, yardsticks. Against these self-appointed poetrypreachers, who presume to give final pronouncements on the beauty, eternality, morality, and conventionality of his work, Mr Shapiro is really<br />\nprotesting. For if he hated all his critics, he would be hating himself,<br />\nthan whom no more powerful critic could be found. In his Own Note On<br />\nPoetry, he sets up his standards.<br />\nI think of poetry as the most common experiences of human<br />\nnature converted by the judgment into verbal impulses and rendered<br />\nby the heart into languages at its most beautiful . .. the poem must<br />\nbe able to cope with a generality, present a homily, or contain a<br />\nmoral or a proof. It cannot undertake to cope with phenomena or<br />\nto deal with the invisible, except<br />\n<br />\nas<br />\n<br />\nthe invisible is believed in by<br />\n<br />\nall. It has no sense of time, no idea of progress or growth, and no<br />\nambition. It cannot entertain for itself the idea of perfection, for<br />\nsuccessful poetry always believes in its own failure.<br />\n<br />\nWhat if a poem should not follow these precepts? According to Mr<br />\nShapiro, would it be poetry, or bad poetry, or what?

He does not always beat down his path carefully and<br />\nhard, but scoots over it at times as if he were being chased, leaving the<br />\nrtader lost in the darkness of the underbrush.

In other words, a reviewer, whether,<br />\nhe is a professional or amateur, is no more than a retail merchant. No matter<br />\nwho the merchant and no matter what his price, the final say, of course, lies<br />\nwith the reader. This amounts to a personal apology to Karl Shapiro for<br />\nreviewing his poems; for he maintains to his poetry falls \"the task of<br />\ndestroying the government of critics and of making a wholesale return to<br />\nthe anarchy of experience.\"<br />\nI don't think Mr Shapiro really means what he says. He does not<br />\ndirect his hatred against all critics, but only a particular class of critics<br />\nwho would chop his poetry up and lay it out beside their carefully measured, but rather worn out, yardsticks. Against these self-appointed poetrypreachers, who presume to give final pronouncements on the beauty, eternality, morality, and conventionality of his work, Mr Shapiro is really<br />\nprotesting. For if he hated all his critics, he would be hating himself,<br />\nthan whom no more powerful critic could be found. In his Own Note On<br />\nPoetry, he sets up his standards.<br />\nI think of poetry as the most common experiences of human<br />\nnature converted by the judgment into verbal impulses and rendered<br />\nby the heart into languages at its most beautiful . .. the poem must<br />\nbe able to cope with a generality, present a homily, or contain a<br />\nmoral or a proof. It cannot undertake to cope with phenomena or<br />\nto deal with the invisible, except<br /><br />\nas<br /><br />\nthe invisible is believed in by<br /><br />\nall. It has no sense of time, no idea of progress or growth, and no<br />\nambition. It cannot entertain for itself the idea of perfection, for<br />\nsuccessful poetry always believes in its own failure.<br /><br />\nWhat if a poem should not follow these precepts? According to Mr<br />\nShapiro, would it be poetry, or bad poetry, or what? Mr Shapiro, of<br />\ncourse, finds himself just so severe as any 9ther critic, and I am sure he<br />\nwould not mind if I told people I liked some of his poems\u2014as they appear<br />\nin the book 5 Young American Poets (second series)\u2014especially Necropolis, The Confirmation, ,University, and Drug Store.<br />\nWhat Mr Shapiro writes about lies not more than a stone's throw away<br />\nfrom his own front porch. Wherever he goes, he writes about nothing he<br />\ncould not reach out and touch if he wanted to. \"I write about myself,\"<br />\nhe says,\"my house,say street, and my city, and not about 'America,' the word<br />\nthat is the chief enemy of modern poetry.\" Nevertheless, it must be said<br />\nthat Mr Shapiro does catch a relatalely small part of the American scene,<br />\nyet a very tine onewsBaltimore.<br />\nithataumberHiwowhimaiteL<br />\ne knows his, own<br />\n13,044<br />\nInsp7ti<br />\n;<br />\nti utio<br />\nlar, ,ti<br />\nhe k;ise<br />\n\u201eperch, the<br />\nas they roll dew* the ,Reisterstown Road.

At other times, however, we lose his image in the obscure depths<br />\nof bungled words. He does not always beat down his path carefully and<br />\nhard, but scoots over it at times as if he were being chased, leaving the<br />\nrtader lost in the darkness of the underbrush.
