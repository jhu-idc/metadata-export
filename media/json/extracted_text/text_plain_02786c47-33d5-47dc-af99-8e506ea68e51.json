Dean of<br />\nStudents, Robert Fitzpatrick,<br />\nhopes the center will begin,<br />\npreliminary operation in<br />\nFebruary 1973.<br />\nAndy Savitz, President of the<br />\nStudent Council, stated that the<br />\nproposal came about as a result<br />\nof the tuition hike scheduled for<br />\nSeptember 1973.<br />\n\"When the tuition hike was<br />\napproved we looked for ways to<br />\n<br />\ncompensate for the added<br />\nexpense.

I think a University<br />\ncomposed entirely of rich people<br />\nwould be one of the worst<br />\neducational possibilities<br />\nimaginable,\" the Dean<br />\n<br />\ncommented.<br />\nFitzpatrick and Savitz stressed<br />\nthe fact that the Employment<br />\nCenter would be an integral part<br />\nof an expanded financial aid<br />\nsystem. Such a program, still in<br />\nearly planning stages, would be<br />\nformulated to meet the<br />\nincreasing financial burden<br />\nimposed by tuition and living<br />\ncosts. The program would entail<br />\nconsolidation and expansion of<br />\nthe existing Financial Aid Office.<br />\nThe Student Employment<br />\nCenter would assist students in<br />\nfinding jobs on and off campus.<br />\n\"Basically what we want is for<br />\nthe University to hire a full time<br />\nemployee whose job would be to<br />\nfind work for undergraduates on<br />\nor off campus.

Consequently,she<br />\ncontinued, many of the problems<br />\nin these areas go unsolved for<br />\n<br />\nlack of financing.

In Western Europe rising<br />\ninflation \"threatens political disaster for<br />\nseveral governments...\" (SUN, 19 Oct),<br />\nand in the US unemployment continues<br />\ndespite unparalelled and unmaintainable<br />\npump-priming.<br />\nWhat does all this mean to the average<br />\nstudent who happily thinks of himself as<br />\nunpolitical? First, he probably won't get<br />\na job. Further he is going to have to<br />\nchoose between two political alternatives:<br />\nsocialism or fascism! These two political<br />\ntendencies appear in the form of ongoing<br />\npolicies and struggles, comprehensible in<br />\nthe way they converge on political ends.<br />\nThe prevailing capitalist policy today is<br />\nausterity, expressed directly in Phase II<br />\n<br />\nEver since its inception five years ago, the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium has centered on political<br />\ntopics, to the exclusion of the arts, humanities and<br />\nsciences. While there have been some very<br />\ndistinguished speakers and very enthusiastic receptions<br />\nof the symposia, never before has any symposium<br />\ncentered on a topic as universally important and as<br />\nuniversally ignored as creativity.<br />\nAlthough this year's chairmen cast their topic in<br />\nthe form of a question, \"Creativity: The Moving Force<br />\nIn Society?\" this year's program still comes far closer<br />\nto more central human concerns than do any of the<br />\nprevious topics, such as Violence, Latin American<br />\nRevolution or the Urban Crises. This year's topic not<br />\nonly invites participation by people prominent in a<br />\nwide range of fields, but also suggests the existence of<br />\na wide range of interests and ability in men.<br />\nThis year's Symposium is a major step forward<br />\nfor everyone at Hopkins. In earlier years, the symposia<br />\ndiscussed specific failures of mankind - for .example,<br />\nthe failure of men to live together peacefully, the<br />\nfailure of men to develop adequately a whole<br />\ncontinent, the failure of men to design habitable cities.<br />\nFor the first time, we are to be told about our<br />\nsuccesses and our abilities, not just about our failures.<br />\nThat in itself should prove to be a large contribution<br />\nto students who for so long have felt threatened by<br />\nfailure in their experience here.<br />\n<br />\nsurvival. At least that would be the logical<br />\nconclusion of the ZG'ers.

Here at Homewood I<br />\noften find myself doubting what I know<br />\nto be truth. Let me explain.<br />\nI'll admit that chem lectures can be<br />\nquite titillating when interesting and<br />\nmesmerizing whether interesting or not.<br />\nHowever, as far as my experience in class<br />\nwill carry me, I'd gladly divert my gaze<br />\nfrom the lesson for nothing more than<br />\nthe discovery and subsequent perusion of<br />\nan appealing devotchka. Just how the<br />\nintrusion of a canine buttinsky into a<br />\ncrowded Remsen 101 could proceed<br />\nunnoticed is far beyond me. You know<br />\none doesn't go around rebuffing man's<br />\nbest friend every day of the week - or<br />\nmaybe you don't know, again I'm not<br />\nquite sure.<br />\nRationale?<br />\nI suppose that a reasonable rationale<br />\ncould be found to explain just how 300<br />\nstudents attached to their seats in<br />\nRemsen at 9 o'clock in the morning<br />\nmight fail to respond were one of<br />\nHopkins' canine stragglers to forget<br />\nhimself for the moment and plunge into<br />\nan already saturated room, destroying the<br />\nequilibrium. Would someone please come<br />\nup with that rationale? Indeed, one of<br />\nour 4-legged friends did invade the<br />\n4uietude that was Remsen, whether out<br />\nof disrespect or ignorance I can't begin to<br />\n<br />\nguess. And believe it or not, save for one<br />\nor two enlightened souls, oh me brothers,<br />\n300 Hoppies sat there in the gravest of<br />\nultrasilence issuing forth not one chuckle<br />\nof recognition as that epitome of caninity<br />\ntraversed the room.<br />\nIf Hoppies are content to so engross<br />\nthemselves in their work, that the<br />\ncomedy of life literally passes them by,<br />\nthen I'm just not quite sure.... Well that<br />\nwas Monday.<br />\nTuesday follows Monday, right? The<br />\nfollowing day I chose to traverse the<br />\nHopkins campus at a relatively rapid clip,<br />\nand much to my dismay, the traditional<br />\njogging apparel. which I decided not to<br />\ndon, was missed by all too many Hoppies.<br />\nIf! experience either the urge or the<br />\nnecessity to race across Homewood en<br />\nroute to a Calculus hourly. and chose to<br />\ndo so in a trot devoid of all mundane<br />\nimpedence, than if for nothing more than<br />\nthe sake of self-release, allow me my<br />\npleasure without those condemning<br />\nstares. I still find it hard to believe that<br />\nme, a humble Hop, could attract such a<br />\nslew of wild eyes by traversing Keyser<br />\n'Quadrangle in a gait distinct from the<br />\naccepted strut. For Hopkins' sake, one<br />\nwould think I was recreating Godiva's<br />\nride!<br />\nIf I've offended anyone I deeply regret<br />\nit. I don't know how it affected you, my<br />\nfellow Hoppies, but for me, even though<br />\nGodiva had nothing to do with it, these<br />\ntwo experiences are a bit of indecent<br />\nexposure.<br />\n<br />\nKing George a tyrant, reviled him, burned<br />\nhim in effigy, revolted against him, and<br />\nthen for the next seventy-five years built<br />\nalmost all of their buildings in a style<br />\nnamed after him. Homewood House and<br />\nthe Barn, constructed at this time as part<br />\nof the Carroll estate, are two of the local<br />\nconsequences of' this fad. When Hopkins<br />\nmoved to its Homewood site, the powers<br />\nthat be decided to continue with the<br />\nGeorgian style, including its ever-present<br />\ncupolas.<br />\nWeathervanes<br />\nFour Homewood buildings are topped<br />\nwith these fanciful Georgian doohickies.<br />\nSmall structures built on the roofs of<br />\nbuildings. these cupolas are intended to<br />\nserve absolutely no purpose whatsoever<br />\nexcept to provide an aesthetic \"capping<br />\noff\" to the neoclassic symmetry of<br />\nGeorgian buildings. They supply a nice<br />\nbase for weathervanes. They would also<br />\nmake nice bell towers, but, judging from<br />\nthe local examples. this rarely occurred to<br />\nanyone.<br />\nThough both the Shriver Hall and Barn<br />\ncupolas are graced with vanes, the cupolas<br />\nwere not built for that purpose. (it's<br />\nalways raining in Baltimore. no matter<br />\nwhich direction the wind is blowing.)<br />\nTherefore, through the process of<br />\ndeductive elimination, the cupolas were<br />\nevidently planned for the strictly artistic<br />\nqualities that they would add to the<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nAfter carefully observing the cupolas at<br />\nHomewood. one can only shake his head<br />\nand sigh, \"They shudda stuck to<br />\nweathervanes.\" The word \"cupola\" is<br />\nLatin for \"little tub,\" but who would<br />\nhave thought that the Hopkins architects<br />\nwould have taken their etymology so<br />\nseriously?<br />\nOnly the barn is enhanced by its<br />\ncupola. Significantly, this is the only<br />\nbuilding with a cupola that was not<br />\nplanned by the University. The simple,<br />\n<br />\ngraceful symmetry of the theatre is<br />\nheightened by a cupola that is<br />\nproportional to the building and thus<br />\ncomplements it. Unfortunately, the same<br />\ncannot be said about the other three<br />\ncupolas. Since students are unaware of<br />\nthe existence of Latrobe Hall, students<br />\nare more than likely unaware of the<br />\nexistence of Latrobe Hall's cupola, an<br />\ninsignificant nothing that does absolutely<br />\nnil for an already nondescript building.<br />\nThe definitely-Georgian Maryland Hall is<br />\ntopped by a vaguely-Gothic-VictorianGingerbread cupola, a relationship that<br />\nlooks as incongruous as it sounds. And<br />\nwhat exactly is that thing rising so<br />\nmajestically and phallically out of Shriver<br />\nHall? If it were a little bit taller it would<br />\nhave made a nice lighthouse.<br />\n<br />\nFor good or bad, cupolas are now on<br />\ntheir way out at Hopkins. Mr. John<br />\nPeach, Director of Physical Planning for<br />\nthe Homewood campus, pointed out that<br />\nnone of the latest buildings constructed<br />\non campus have cupolas. The reason for<br />\nthis, he explained, is that \"the University<br />\nis gradually making the transition from<br />\nthe Georgian style to the contemporary<br />\nstyle.\" Peach added that bell towers and<br />\ncupolas serve only frivolous purposes, and<br />\nthat the University does not have the<br />\nmoney to build them. But judging from<br />\nHopkins' last step in the transition,<br />\nGarland Hall. even a cupolated<br />\nmonstrosity would be a vast<br />\nimprovement.<br />\nBut on Keyser...<br />\nAll of the vulgarities and absurdities of<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nthese cupolas are counterbalanced by<br />\nGilman Hall's clock tower, a structure<br />\nsimilar in design to but much larger in<br />\nproportion than a cupola. Gilman was the<br />\nfirst building built by the University on<br />\nthe Homewood site, and they should have<br />\nstopped while they were ahead. The<br />\nGilman tower is the most visually plasing<br />\nstructure on campus, dominating the<br />\nKeyser Quadrangle and yet not<br />\noverpowering it.<br />\nThe most interesting aspect of the<br />\ntower is the clock. Belting out<br />\nWestminster Chimes, or parts therof,<br />\nevery fifteen minutes, the clock was built<br />\nin Boston by the grandfather of Dr.<br />\nDonald Howard, Professor of English at<br />\nHopkins, while the bells themselves are<br />\nnatives of Baltimore. Both the clock and<br />\nthe chimes are weight-operated, wound<br />\nevery week by the University's chief<br />\nelectrician. And once a year, during the<br />\nCommencement in May, the chimes are<br />\nturned off.<br />\nSince Gilman Hall is a major focal<br />\npoint of the campus, the tower has been<br />\nthe site of many extracurricular events<br />\nand at least one prank. In April of 1960,<br />\nseveral frolicsome Hoppies, taking time<br />\nout from their goldfish swallowing and<br />\ntelephone booth stuffing, placed a big<br />\npicture of Mickey Mouse's face on the<br />\nclock, thus making it the world's largest<br />\nMickey Mouse watch. And until a few<br />\nyears ago, trumpeters used to stand on<br />\nthe balcony at the base of the cupola<br />\nduring the Glee Club's annual Christmas<br />\nconcert that was held in the quad in front<br />\nof Gilman Hall, a custom that has<br />\nunfortunately fallen by the wayside.<br />\nOne just hopes that, when those<br />\nfour-eyed creatures from the planet<br />\nThwylo land on Earth and dig up the<br />\nremnants of civilization that they will<br />\nuncover Gilman Hall instead of Shriver.<br />\nThey'll never figure out why Hopkins put<br />\na short lighthouse atop their auditorium.<br />\n<br />\n\fuptight<br />\nfri. october 20<br />\n<br />\nsat. october 21<br />\n<br />\nTheatre<br />\n\"The Apple Cart\" by G.B.<br />\nShaw.

Last<br />\nyear they were near the bottom<br />\nof the list of cross country<br />\nfinishers in meets as well as in<br />\npractice. More than once there<br />\nwas some question as to whether<br />\ntheir times would ever improve<br />\nor if they would just continue in<br />\nthe same rut. This year both<br />\nparts of the question were<br />\nanswered.<br />\nKen, a junior political science<br />\nmajor, has taken his running<br />\nmore seriously this year than ever<br />\nbefore. Last year his main aim<br />\nwas simply to stay in shape. This<br />\nseason he says, .\"I've dropped<br />\nsmoking my cigar and decided to<br />\ngive cross country an honest<br />\nchance.\" No one was more<br />\n<br />\nsurprised .than Ken when his<br />\ntimes started improving. He also<br />\nbegan to move up on the list of<br />\nrunners.<br />\nThe season has already had its<br />\nfirst highlight for Ken as he<br />\nplaced in the top five for<br />\nHopkins in the team's recent<br />\nlosses to Haverford and Drexel.<br />\nInspired by his recent success<br />\nKen plans to run track this spring<br />\nif he can fit it in between his.<br />\nskydiving trips.<br />\nJohn Tetzlaff is in his second<br />\nyear of cross country. He is at a<br />\nparticular disadvantage because<br />\nof his build, which is tall and<br />\nmuscular rather than the shorter<br />\nslighter figure presented by most<br />\nrunners. In an attempt to<br />\ncompensate John came back to<br />\nschool this fall fifteen pounds<br />\nlighter than last 'year and with<br />\nseveral hundred miles of running<br />\n<br />\nPodrazik, Charley Gilman, Joe<br />\nRutkowski, and John Igoe<br />\ncontinually turned Gettysburg<br />\noffensive threats into Hopkins'<br />\noffensive maneuvers.<br />\nWith sixteen minutes left in<br />\nthe game, Hieter crossed the ball,<br />\nafter leaving his defender on the<br />\nground, from the right side of the<br />\nfield, to the head of Arguero who<br />\nplaced the ball into the left side<br />\nof the net away from the goalie.<br />\nThis was his eighth goal of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nThen, as tradition would have<br />\nit, senior Marc Manzione, who<br />\nhad scored one goal in each of<br />\nthe past three games with<br />\nGettysburg, added his share to<br />\nthe scoreboard with nine minutes<br />\nleft in the game. The ball was<br />\nlooped into the middle of the<br />\nfield to Manzione who<br />\nfancy-footed his way around<br />\nthree Bullet defenders and placed<br />\nthe ball into the right corner<br />\nwhile the goalie was coming out.<br />\n\"A fine, all around team<br />\neffort,\" were the words of coach<br />\nRobert Oliver who gave everyone<br />\non the team a chance to play.<br />\n\"It was a deserving win. As in<br />\nsome of our other games, we<br />\ndeserved to win but didn't. We<br />\ntalked about the win then, now<br />\nwe got it.\"<br />\n<br />\nand bicycling done this summer.<br />\nAlthough he has been running<br />\nbetter and his times have<br />\nimproved greatly he has been<br />\nhampered by recent injuries. At<br />\nDickinson, as he was going down<br />\na hill, \"...I went one way and my<br />\nlegs went the other...\" The result<br />\nwas a sprained ankle, which kept<br />\nhim from finishing the race. To<br />\nadd to the injury John has had a<br />\nbad case of shin splints for<br />\nseveral weeks; he has, however,<br />\nconsistently placed in the top<br />\nfive Hopkins runners. Lately he<br />\nhas been running easier in<br />\npractices in an attempt to allow<br />\ntime for his legs to heal. Since he<br />\nis in better shape this fall John<br />\nplans to run the marathon this<br />\nwinter, in preparation for track<br />\nin the spring and perhaps a trip<br />\nto Boston to run in the marathon<br />\nclassic.<br />\n<br />\nexcept for last Sunday's 21-0<br />\nwhitewash courtesy of the Dallas<br />\nCowboys, but McCafferty's<br />\nability speaks for itself. In 1970,<br />\nthe 51 year old \"Easy Rider,\"<br />\ninheriting a club that carried an<br />\n8-5-1 record for coaching great,<br />\nDon Shula, only took the Colts<br />\nto their first World<br />\nChampionship since 1959. To<br />\nthose cynics who claim that<br />\nMcCafferty did it with Shula's<br />\nteam, one might point out that as<br />\nof yet, Don Shula has never won<br />\na World Championship. In the<br />\nmeantime, last season the Colts<br />\nfinished within one game of<br />\nduplicating their 1970 feast.<br />\nBut maybe there is something<br />\nto be said for Mac's failures this<br />\nyear. After all, McCafferty<br />\nshould be held accountable for<br />\nthe Colts poor showing<br />\nparticularly since the front office<br />\nlet ALL-PRO John Williams slip<br />\nout of their hands following a<br />\ncontract dispute, and of course<br />\nhe must also be faulted for<br />\nBubba Smith tearing his knee<br />\ninto a pulp while running over a<br />\nchain marker. But hold on, there<br />\nis more. McCafferty should be<br />\nblamed for losing Eddie Hinton,<br />\nNorm Bulaich and Glen Ressler<br />\nto injuries and let us not forget<br />\nJohn Mackey who decided he<br />\ndidn't want to play second string<br />\nto Tom Mitchell, the Colts<br />\nleading receiver. Mackey, one<br />\nmight recall has had problems<br />\ntripping over blades of grass after<br />\nhauling in his pat ented one catch<br />\nper game the last couple of years.<br />\nSurely McCafferty is to blame,<br />\nand the front office who hasn't<br />\neven bothered to meet the<br />\nplayers yet, is in full command of<br />\nthe situation.<br />\nPerhaps the most tragic part of<br />\nsee COLT WOES, page 11<br />\n<br />\n\foctober 20, 1972/news-letter page 11<br />\n<br />\nJohnny U QB's from bench<br />\nCOLT WOES,from page 10<br />\nit all is the demoting of 39 year<br />\nold John Unitas, most likely the<br />\nreason for McCafferty's dismissal.<br />\nUnitas, considered by many to be<br />\nthe greatest quarterback that ever<br />\nlived, has been very patient with<br />\nthe Colts' new inexperienced<br />\nreceivers. Eddie Hinton, Unitas'<br />\nfavorite target, is sidelined with a<br />\ngroin injury. In 1970, the Colts<br />\nhad one of the finest receivers in<br />\nfootball, Roy Jefferson. One<br />\ncontract dispute later, he was<br />\ngone.<br />\nSince then, the Colts have lost<br />\nall of their veteran receivers<br />\nthrough retirement or contract<br />\ndisputes making it pretty<br />\nfrustrating for \"the old master,\"<br />\nholder of virtually every passing<br />\nrecord in league history. The<br />\ntruth of it is, that Unitas has not<br />\nlooked had at all, standing third<br />\namong AFC quarterbacks in<br />\nPassing statistics this year. What<br />\nis so disgusting is the receiver's<br />\ninability to get open and when<br />\nthey have broken clear, their<br />\n<br />\nfailure to handle John Unitas'<br />\nperfectly thrown passes. Granted,<br />\nUnitas isn't getting any younger,<br />\nbut he's still one of the best<br />\nquarterbacks round.<br />\nJohn Unitas broke in with the<br />\nColts in 1956 along with another<br />\nunknown by the name of<br />\nRaymond Berry. It took Unitas<br />\none year to record the Colts first<br />\nwinning season. A season later,<br />\nthe 25 year old quarterback took<br />\nthe Colts to the World<br />\nChampionship before repeating<br />\nhis feat again in 1959. In 1960,<br />\nthe Colts missed out on the title<br />\nby a hair's breadth and for the<br />\nyears that followed including a<br />\nWestern Conference title in 1964<br />\nand a NFL title in 1968, Unitas<br />\nwas the Colts. In the early sixties<br />\nhe carried a mediocre football<br />\nteam, making them look far<br />\nbetter than they really were, even<br />\nbattling for titles that couldn't be<br />\nwon.<br />\nNo one could ever forget his<br />\nclassic \"two minute drills\" which<br />\nhe used with cool, clever, daring<br />\n<br />\nJays host battle with<br />\ntough Georgetown<br />\nFOOTBALL,from page 10<br />\nof last year's game.<br />\nEntering the Georgetown<br />\ngame, the Blue Jays rank second<br />\nal passing and rushing and fifth<br />\nin defense in the league statistics.<br />\nQuarterback Jack Thomas has<br />\ncompleted 45 of 76 passes for<br />\n429 yards and three touchdowns.<br />\n<br />\nRick Kowalchuk and Grant<br />\nSkevchik have been the top<br />\nreceivers with seventeen and<br />\nthirteen receptions respectively.<br />\nTim Doyle still remains the<br />\nteam's leading ground gainer with<br />\n167 yards.

Time after time with<br />\nseconds remaining on the clock,<br />\nUnitas pulled of spine tingling<br />\nmiracles that electrified and<br />\ndelighted the fans. In 1967,<br />\nUnitas took the Colts through<br />\n13 games without a defeat before<br />\nbowing to the Rams in the last<br />\ngame of the season. He<br />\nannihilated the opposition with<br />\noverwhelming scores, literally<br />\nshredding some of the finest<br />\ndefenses in the league. It was his<br />\nthird Most Valuable Player<br />\nAward that year and no one<br />\ndeserved it more. In 1968, the<br />\narm fell victim to tendonitus and<br />\nsome doubted whether Unitas<br />\nwould ever make it back. Not<br />\nbeing able to throw beyond<br />\nfifteen yards, he rallied the Colts<br />\nin the Super Bowl before time<br />\nput the game away.

In response, the<br />\nCouncil is attempting to improve<br />\nits communication with the<br />\nUniversity community.<br />\n\"We must make clear our role<br />\nand give publicity to the<br />\nCouncil,\" said Dr. Francis<br />\nRourke, Political Science, a new<br />\nmember of the Council. Another<br />\nmember, Dr. M. Gordon Wolman,<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering stated, \"We must try<br />\nto get rid of the notion of the<br />\nAcademic Council as some type<br />\nof cloak and dagger operation.\"<br />\nThere was some discussion<br />\namong the Council as to whether<br />\nwhat goes on at Academic<br />\nCouncil meetings should be<br />\npublicized. Dean George Owen,<br />\nex-officio member, has settled<br />\nthis, however, by submitting the<br />\nminutes of Academic Council<br />\nmeetings to the Hopkins Gazette<br />\nfor publication.<br />\nRecently, Council actions and<br />\ndiscussions have centered upon<br />\nthe processing of individual<br />\nappointments, the issue of<br />\nappointing more women to the<br />\nfaculty, the creation of some<br />\ntype of student evaluation of<br />\nteaching, and the establishment<br />\nof \"adjunct research<br />\nprofessorships,\" which according<br />\nto Dean Owen, \"are the<br />\nequivalent of faculty members,<br />\nbut are not paid by the<br />\nUniversity - they do strictly<br /><br />\nresearch.\"<br />\nThe Blue Ribbon Panel<br />\nReport, which presented its final<br />\nreport last spring, is scheduled to<br />\nbe discussed soon. Many<br />\nmembers have stated that it is<br />\n\"probably too early to comment<br />\non the BRP yet.\"<br /><br />\ntheir individual views to Woolf.<br />\nAfter the Provost has studied<br />\nthese proposals and formulated a<br />\ngeneral view of the situation, the<br />\ncommittee will be called and<br />\nhopefully arrive at some sort of<br />\nconsensus.<br />\nSuskind stated that he felt that<br />\nmost of the opinions had been<br />\nsubmitted to Woolf and that the<br />\ncommittee would be meeting in<br />\nthe near future. \"Discussion and<br />\nanalysis will continue for some<br />\ntime,\" he added.<br />\nThe Dean commented on the<br />\ndifficulty. of determining . the<br />\n\"guiding principles\" for such a<br />\ndepartment.<br />\n\"We must gather information<br />\non what education departments<br />\ndo and what its composition and<br />\ncomrnittment should be,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nSuskind questioned whether or<br />\nnot there was a specific discipline<br />\nof education and asked if it were<br /><br />\npossibly an inter-disciplinary area<br />\nof study.<br />\n\"It would be foolhardy to say<br />\nthat yes, there will be a<br />\ndepartment.

Dean of<br />\nStudents, Robert Fitzpatrick,<br />\nhopes the center will begin,<br />\npreliminary operation in<br />\nFebruary 1973.<br />\nAndy Savitz, President of the<br />\nStudent Council, stated that the<br />\nproposal came about as a result<br />\nof the tuition hike scheduled for<br />\nSeptember 1973.<br />\n\"When the tuition hike was<br />\napproved we looked for ways to<br /><br />\ncompensate for the added<br />\nexpense. Increased financial aid<br />\nand more part-time jobs for<br />\nundergraduates seemed a<br />\nworkable solution,\" Savitz<br />\ncommented.<br />\nFitzpatrick characterized the<br />\nUniversity's role in the creation<br />\nof such a center as necessary,<br />\nciting the tuition increase and<br />\nfederal cutbacks on the<br />\nWork -Study Program as<br />\nincreasing the economic burden<br />\non Hopkins undergraduates.<br />\n\"I think that the University<br />\nhas a responsibility that goes<br />\nbeyond the classroom. Therefore<br />\nif we don't want to limit the<br />\nUniversity to those who can pay,<br />\nthen we have to accept<br />\nresponsibility for those who<br />\ncan't. I think a University<br />\ncomposed entirely of rich people<br />\nwould be one of the worst<br />\neducational possibilities<br />\nimaginable,\" the Dean<br /><br />\ncommented.<br />\nFitzpatrick and Savitz stressed<br />\nthe fact that the Employment<br />\nCenter would be an integral part<br />\nof an expanded financial aid<br />\nsystem. Such a program, still in<br />\nearly planning stages, would be<br />\nformulated to meet the<br />\nincreasing financial burden<br />\nimposed by tuition and living<br />\ncosts. The program would entail<br />\nconsolidation and expansion of<br />\nthe existing Financial Aid Office.<br />\nThe Student Employment<br />\nCenter would assist students in<br />\nfinding jobs on and off campus.<br />\n\"Basically what we want is for<br />\nthe University to hire a full time<br />\nemployee whose job would be to<br />\nfind work for undergraduates on<br />\nor off campus.

We<br />\nchallenge any ZG'er, physicist, or<br />\ninterested person to refute the<br />\npracticality of fusion-power.<br />\nThe only factor standing in the way of<br />\nman's qualitative leap forward predicated<br />\non fusion power is capitalism. At present<br />\nonly $26 million has been provided for<br />\nnecessary research compared to the<br />\nbillions squandered in underwriting<br />\ninvestment in fossil fuels.<br />\nIn contrast to this social, task-oriented<br />\ndefinition of creativity, in the Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium creativity is presented as an<br />\nabstraction.

Here at Homewood I<br />\noften find myself doubting what I know<br />\nto be truth. Let me explain.<br />\nI'll admit that chem lectures can be<br />\nquite titillating when interesting and<br />\nmesmerizing whether interesting or not.<br />\nHowever, as far as my experience in class<br />\nwill carry me, I'd gladly divert my gaze<br />\nfrom the lesson for nothing more than<br />\nthe discovery and subsequent perusion of<br />\nan appealing devotchka. Just how the<br />\nintrusion of a canine buttinsky into a<br />\ncrowded Remsen 101 could proceed<br />\nunnoticed is far beyond me. You know<br />\none doesn't go around rebuffing man's<br />\nbest friend every day of the week - or<br />\nmaybe you don't know, again I'm not<br />\nquite sure.<br />\nRationale?<br />\nI suppose that a reasonable rationale<br />\ncould be found to explain just how 300<br />\nstudents attached to their seats in<br />\nRemsen at 9 o'clock in the morning<br />\nmight fail to respond were one of<br />\nHopkins' canine stragglers to forget<br />\nhimself for the moment and plunge into<br />\nan already saturated room, destroying the<br />\nequilibrium. Would someone please come<br />\nup with that rationale? Indeed, one of<br />\nour 4-legged friends did invade the<br />\n4uietude that was Remsen, whether out<br />\nof disrespect or ignorance I can't begin to<br /><br />\nguess. And believe it or not, save for one<br />\nor two enlightened souls, oh me brothers,<br />\n300 Hoppies sat there in the gravest of<br />\nultrasilence issuing forth not one chuckle<br />\nof recognition as that epitome of caninity<br />\ntraversed the room.<br />\nIf Hoppies are content to so engross<br />\nthemselves in their work, that the<br />\ncomedy of life literally passes them by,<br />\nthen I'm just not quite sure.... Well that<br />\nwas Monday.<br />\nTuesday follows Monday, right? The<br />\nfollowing day I chose to traverse the<br />\nHopkins campus at a relatively rapid clip,<br />\nand much to my dismay, the traditional<br />\njogging apparel. which I decided not to<br />\ndon, was missed by all too many Hoppies.<br />\nIf! experience either the urge or the<br />\nnecessity to race across Homewood en<br />\nroute to a Calculus hourly. and chose to<br />\ndo so in a trot devoid of all mundane<br />\nimpedence, than if for nothing more than<br />\nthe sake of self-release, allow me my<br />\npleasure without those condemning<br />\nstares. I still find it hard to believe that<br />\nme, a humble Hop, could attract such a<br />\nslew of wild eyes by traversing Keyser<br />\n'Quadrangle in a gait distinct from the<br />\naccepted strut. For Hopkins' sake, one<br />\nwould think I was recreating Godiva's<br />\nride!<br />\nIf I've offended anyone I deeply regret<br />\nit. I don't know how it affected you, my<br />\nfellow Hoppies, but for me, even though<br />\nGodiva had nothing to do with it, these<br />\ntwo experiences are a bit of indecent<br />\nexposure.<br /><br />\nKing George a tyrant, reviled him, burned<br />\nhim in effigy, revolted against him, and<br />\nthen for the next seventy-five years built<br />\nalmost all of their buildings in a style<br />\nnamed after him. Homewood House and<br />\nthe Barn, constructed at this time as part<br />\nof the Carroll estate, are two of the local<br />\nconsequences of' this fad. When Hopkins<br />\nmoved to its Homewood site, the powers<br />\nthat be decided to continue with the<br />\nGeorgian style, including its ever-present<br />\ncupolas.<br />\nWeathervanes<br />\nFour Homewood buildings are topped<br />\nwith these fanciful Georgian doohickies.<br />\nSmall structures built on the roofs of<br />\nbuildings. these cupolas are intended to<br />\nserve absolutely no purpose whatsoever<br />\nexcept to provide an aesthetic \"capping<br />\noff\" to the neoclassic symmetry of<br />\nGeorgian buildings. They supply a nice<br />\nbase for weathervanes. They would also<br />\nmake nice bell towers, but, judging from<br />\nthe local examples. this rarely occurred to<br />\nanyone.<br />\nThough both the Shriver Hall and Barn<br />\ncupolas are graced with vanes, the cupolas<br />\nwere not built for that purpose. (it's<br />\nalways raining in Baltimore. no matter<br />\nwhich direction the wind is blowing.)<br />\nTherefore, through the process of<br />\ndeductive elimination, the cupolas were<br />\nevidently planned for the strictly artistic<br />\nqualities that they would add to the<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nAfter carefully observing the cupolas at<br />\nHomewood. one can only shake his head<br />\nand sigh, \"They shudda stuck to<br />\nweathervanes.\" The word \"cupola\" is<br />\nLatin for \"little tub,\" but who would<br />\nhave thought that the Hopkins architects<br />\nwould have taken their etymology so<br />\nseriously?<br />\nOnly the barn is enhanced by its<br />\ncupola. Significantly, this is the only<br />\nbuilding with a cupola that was not<br />\nplanned by the University. The simple,<br /><br />\ngraceful symmetry of the theatre is<br />\nheightened by a cupola that is<br />\nproportional to the building and thus<br />\ncomplements it. Unfortunately, the same<br />\ncannot be said about the other three<br />\ncupolas. Since students are unaware of<br />\nthe existence of Latrobe Hall, students<br />\nare more than likely unaware of the<br />\nexistence of Latrobe Hall's cupola, an<br />\ninsignificant nothing that does absolutely<br />\nnil for an already nondescript building.<br />\nThe definitely-Georgian Maryland Hall is<br />\ntopped by a vaguely-Gothic-VictorianGingerbread cupola, a relationship that<br />\nlooks as incongruous as it sounds. And<br />\nwhat exactly is that thing rising so<br />\nmajestically and phallically out of Shriver<br />\nHall? If it were a little bit taller it would<br />\nhave made a nice lighthouse.<br /><br />\nFor good or bad, cupolas are now on<br />\ntheir way out at Hopkins. Mr. John<br />\nPeach, Director of Physical Planning for<br />\nthe Homewood campus, pointed out that<br />\nnone of the latest buildings constructed<br />\non campus have cupolas. The reason for<br />\nthis, he explained, is that \"the University<br />\nis gradually making the transition from<br />\nthe Georgian style to the contemporary<br />\nstyle.\" Peach added that bell towers and<br />\ncupolas serve only frivolous purposes, and<br />\nthat the University does not have the<br />\nmoney to build them. But judging from<br />\nHopkins' last step in the transition,<br />\nGarland Hall. even a cupolated<br />\nmonstrosity would be a vast<br />\nimprovement.<br />\nBut on Keyser...<br />\nAll of the vulgarities and absurdities of<br />\nA<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nthese cupolas are counterbalanced by<br />\nGilman Hall's clock tower, a structure<br />\nsimilar in design to but much larger in<br />\nproportion than a cupola. Gilman was the<br />\nfirst building built by the University on<br />\nthe Homewood site, and they should have<br />\nstopped while they were ahead. The<br />\nGilman tower is the most visually plasing<br />\nstructure on campus, dominating the<br />\nKeyser Quadrangle and yet not<br />\noverpowering it.<br />\nThe most interesting aspect of the<br />\ntower is the clock. Belting out<br />\nWestminster Chimes, or parts therof,<br />\nevery fifteen minutes, the clock was built<br />\nin Boston by the grandfather of Dr.<br />\nDonald Howard, Professor of English at<br />\nHopkins, while the bells themselves are<br />\nnatives of Baltimore. Both the clock and<br />\nthe chimes are weight-operated, wound<br />\nevery week by the University's chief<br />\nelectrician. And once a year, during the<br />\nCommencement in May, the chimes are<br />\nturned off.<br />\nSince Gilman Hall is a major focal<br />\npoint of the campus, the tower has been<br />\nthe site of many extracurricular events<br />\nand at least one prank. In April of 1960,<br />\nseveral frolicsome Hoppies, taking time<br />\nout from their goldfish swallowing and<br />\ntelephone booth stuffing, placed a big<br />\npicture of Mickey Mouse's face on the<br />\nclock, thus making it the world's largest<br />\nMickey Mouse watch. And until a few<br />\nyears ago, trumpeters used to stand on<br />\nthe balcony at the base of the cupola<br />\nduring the Glee Club's annual Christmas<br />\nconcert that was held in the quad in front<br />\nof Gilman Hall, a custom that has<br />\nunfortunately fallen by the wayside.<br />\nOne just hopes that, when those<br />\nfour-eyed creatures from the planet<br />\nThwylo land on Earth and dig up the<br />\nremnants of civilization that they will<br />\nuncover Gilman Hall instead of Shriver.<br />\nThey'll never figure out why Hopkins put<br />\na short lighthouse atop their auditorium.<br /><br />\nuptight<br />\nfri. october 20<br /><br />\nsat. october 21<br /><br />\nTheatre<br />\n\"The Apple Cart\" by G.B.<br />\nShaw.

Last<br />\nyear they were near the bottom<br />\nof the list of cross country<br />\nfinishers in meets as well as in<br />\npractice. More than once there<br />\nwas some question as to whether<br />\ntheir times would ever improve<br />\nor if they would just continue in<br />\nthe same rut. This year both<br />\nparts of the question were<br />\nanswered.<br />\nKen, a junior political science<br />\nmajor, has taken his running<br />\nmore seriously this year than ever<br />\nbefore. Last year his main aim<br />\nwas simply to stay in shape. This<br />\nseason he says, .\"I've dropped<br />\nsmoking my cigar and decided to<br />\ngive cross country an honest<br />\nchance.\" No one was more<br /><br />\nsurprised .than Ken when his<br />\ntimes started improving. He also<br />\nbegan to move up on the list of<br />\nrunners.<br />\nThe season has already had its<br />\nfirst highlight for Ken as he<br />\nplaced in the top five for<br />\nHopkins in the team's recent<br />\nlosses to Haverford and Drexel.<br />\nInspired by his recent success<br />\nKen plans to run track this spring<br />\nif he can fit it in between his.<br />\nskydiving trips.<br />\nJohn Tetzlaff is in his second<br />\nyear of cross country. He is at a<br />\nparticular disadvantage because<br />\nof his build, which is tall and<br />\nmuscular rather than the shorter<br />\nslighter figure presented by most<br />\nrunners. In an attempt to<br />\ncompensate John came back to<br />\nschool this fall fifteen pounds<br />\nlighter than last 'year and with<br />\nseveral hundred miles of running<br /><br />\nPodrazik, Charley Gilman, Joe<br />\nRutkowski, and John Igoe<br />\ncontinually turned Gettysburg<br />\noffensive threats into Hopkins'<br />\noffensive maneuvers.<br />\nWith sixteen minutes left in<br />\nthe game, Hieter crossed the ball,<br />\nafter leaving his defender on the<br />\nground, from the right side of the<br />\nfield, to the head of Arguero who<br />\nplaced the ball into the left side<br />\nof the net away from the goalie.<br />\nThis was his eighth goal of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nThen, as tradition would have<br />\nit, senior Marc Manzione, who<br />\nhad scored one goal in each of<br />\nthe past three games with<br />\nGettysburg, added his share to<br />\nthe scoreboard with nine minutes<br />\nleft in the game. The ball was<br />\nlooped into the middle of the<br />\nfield to Manzione who<br />\nfancy-footed his way around<br />\nthree Bullet defenders and placed<br />\nthe ball into the right corner<br />\nwhile the goalie was coming out.<br />\n\"A fine, all around team<br />\neffort,\" were the words of coach<br />\nRobert Oliver who gave everyone<br />\non the team a chance to play.<br />\n\"It was a deserving win.

In 1970,<br />\nthe 51 year old \"Easy Rider,\"<br />\ninheriting a club that carried an<br />\n8-5-1 record for coaching great,<br />\nDon Shula, only took the Colts<br />\nto their first World<br />\nChampionship since 1959. To<br />\nthose cynics who claim that<br />\nMcCafferty did it with Shula's<br />\nteam, one might point out that as<br />\nof yet, Don Shula has never won<br />\na World Championship. In the<br />\nmeantime, last season the Colts<br />\nfinished within one game of<br />\nduplicating their 1970 feast.<br />\nBut maybe there is something<br />\nto be said for Mac's failures this<br />\nyear. After all, McCafferty<br />\nshould be held accountable for<br />\nthe Colts poor showing<br />\nparticularly since the front office<br />\nlet ALL-PRO John Williams slip<br />\nout of their hands following a<br />\ncontract dispute, and of course<br />\nhe must also be faulted for<br />\nBubba Smith tearing his knee<br />\ninto a pulp while running over a<br />\nchain marker. But hold on, there<br />\nis more. McCafferty should be<br />\nblamed for losing Eddie Hinton,<br />\nNorm Bulaich and Glen Ressler<br />\nto injuries and let us not forget<br />\nJohn Mackey who decided he<br />\ndidn't want to play second string<br />\nto Tom Mitchell, the Colts<br />\nleading receiver. Mackey, one<br />\nmight recall has had problems<br />\ntripping over blades of grass after<br />\nhauling in his pat ented one catch<br />\nper game the last couple of years.<br />\nSurely McCafferty is to blame,<br />\nand the front office who hasn't<br />\neven bothered to meet the<br />\nplayers yet, is in full command of<br />\nthe situation.<br />\nPerhaps the most tragic part of<br />\nsee COLT WOES, page 11<br /><br />\noctober 20, 1972/news-letter page 11<br /><br />\nJohnny U QB's from bench<br />\nCOLT WOES,from page 10<br />\nit all is the demoting of 39 year<br />\nold John Unitas, most likely the<br />\nreason for McCafferty's dismissal.<br />\nUnitas, considered by many to be<br />\nthe greatest quarterback that ever<br />\nlived, has been very patient with<br />\nthe Colts' new inexperienced<br />\nreceivers. Eddie Hinton, Unitas'<br />\nfavorite target, is sidelined with a<br />\ngroin injury. In 1970, the Colts<br />\nhad one of the finest receivers in<br />\nfootball, Roy Jefferson. One<br />\ncontract dispute later, he was<br />\ngone.<br />\nSince then, the Colts have lost<br />\nall of their veteran receivers<br />\nthrough retirement or contract<br />\ndisputes making it pretty<br />\nfrustrating for \"the old master,\"<br />\nholder of virtually every passing<br />\nrecord in league history. The<br />\ntruth of it is, that Unitas has not<br />\nlooked had at all, standing third<br />\namong AFC quarterbacks in<br />\nPassing statistics this year. What<br />\nis so disgusting is the receiver's<br />\ninability to get open and when<br />\nthey have broken clear, their<br /><br />\nfailure to handle John Unitas'<br />\nperfectly thrown passes. Granted,<br />\nUnitas isn't getting any younger,<br />\nbut he's still one of the best<br />\nquarterbacks round.<br />\nJohn Unitas broke in with the<br />\nColts in 1956 along with another<br />\nunknown by the name of<br />\nRaymond Berry. It took Unitas<br />\none year to record the Colts first<br />\nwinning season. A season later,<br />\nthe 25 year old quarterback took<br />\nthe Colts to the World<br />\nChampionship before repeating<br />\nhis feat again in 1959. In 1960,<br />\nthe Colts missed out on the title<br />\nby a hair's breadth and for the<br />\nyears that followed including a<br />\nWestern Conference title in 1964<br />\nand a NFL title in 1968, Unitas<br />\nwas the Colts.
