A word on that score<br />\nshould suffice. We are faced with<br />\ntwo problems here: that of underemphasizing the fraternity influence<br />\nand that of overemphasizing it. It<br />\nmust not be believed that the fraternity man is ipso facto incompetent or<br />\ncrooked.

The fundamental<br />\ninheritance mechanism (i e., chromosomes and genes) responsible for<br />\nMendelian heredity in organisms in<br />\ngeneral, is present in Sciara. It is the<br />\noperation and segregation of these<br />\nchromosomes which is different, and<br />\nthe ratios of inherited factors are<br />\ntherefore different. It is the fact that<br />\nSciara has that typical fundamental<br />\nhereditary system and yet the system<br />\noperates in a manner so different from<br />\nthat in the ordinary organism, which<br />\nmakes it especially important for research. By studying these differences<br />\nand abnormal actions, additional light<br />\nis thrown on the nature of the fundamental mechanism responsible for<br />\nMendelian inheritance.<br />\nMorris A.

The fundamental<br />\ninheritance mechanism (i e., chromosomes and genes) responsible for<br />\nMendelian heredity in organisms in<br />\ngeneral, is present in Sciara. It is the<br />\noperation and segregation of these<br />\nchromosomes which is different, and<br />\nthe ratios of inherited factors are<br />\ntherefore different. It is the fact that<br />\nSciara has that typical fundamental<br />\nhereditary system and yet the system<br />\noperates in a manner so different from<br />\nthat in the ordinary organism, which<br />\nmakes it especially important for research.

But even for a reader<br />\nhitherto unacquainted with this magnificent family, Whiteoak Harvest is<br />\na rich and lusty tale, complete in itself. All Jalna fans will find this book<br />\nas satisfactory as any\u2014indeed, it is<br />\nvery nearly the best of the lot.<br />\nMa.zo de la Roche handles her many<br />\ncharacters and their multiple activities so skillfully that each retains his<br />\nown strongly individual characteristics. There is the story of Finch and<br />\niiis too-possessive wife, there is Uncle<br />\nErnest's belated love affair, there are<br />\nClara Lebraux and her daughter,<br />\neiaketield with his amazing self-importance which he takes into a monastery, and the mortgage which hangs<br />\nover them all\u2014plenty of dramatic material. All these are really surplots,<br />\nhowever, less important than the<br />\ncrisis in the life of Jalna's master,<br />\nRonny Whiteoak. Remy is one of the<br />\nmost compelling and attractive figures in recent fiction. Most women<br />\nwill not understand how his coldly<br />\nself-centered wife Alayne could possibly leave him, though to be sure she<br />\n,had a good reason. Their differences<br />\nare satisfactorily settled in the final<br />\nchapters, but let us hope this won't<br />\nmean the end of the Jalna book. No,<br />\nas long as there is a Whiteoak left<br />\nalive there will be exciting and important things going on at Jalna.<br />\nGod in a Rolls-Royce.
