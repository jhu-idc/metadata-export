Savitz had<br />\nearlier stated that the advance<br />\nPlanning of the concert was<br />\nPoorly done.<br />\nOn Their Own<br />\nThe Student Council, after<br />\ndeciding on Nov. 1 to curtail all<br />\ncooperation with the<br />\nadministration except on the<br />\ngovernance reform issue, elected<br />\nto run the concert on their own.<br />\nThey renounced administration<br />\nsupport, deciding to sponsor and<br />\nOperate the concert themselves.<br />\nThe Council's decision to run<br />\nthe event without school<br />\nsupport came on the heels of the<br />\nresignation of Esta Baker,<br />\nCouncil VP and Social<br />\nCommittee Chairman. The<br />\nresultant confusion lead many<br />\nCouncil members to estimate<br />\nthat losses from the<br />\nYoungbloods concert would<br />\ntotal over $4,000. Savitz then<br />\nvolunteered to run the event.<br />\nSavitz commented that the<br />\nlack of Administration support<br />\nfor the concert was not a factor<br />\nin the losswhich was incurred. \"I<br />\ndon't think that administration<br />\ncooperation could have helped<br />\nus any,\" he said. Savitz had<br />\n<br />\nearlier indicated that the turnout<br />\nwould be a measure of student<br />\nsupport for SC actions to cut<br />\nadministration ties.<br />\nMany Council members at the<br />\nNov. 1 meeting were opposed to<br />\ncontinuing the proposed<br />\nconcert, saying that the<br />\nprojected loss would be greater<br />\nthan the Council could afford.<br />\n\"If we lose a lot of money on<br />\nthis concert, it will shoot down<br />\nthe social events for the rest of<br />\nthe year,\" one member said.<br />\nSome Council members were<br />\ncritical of the manner in which<br />\nBaker handled the advance<br />\nplanning of the event. Some<br />\nspeculated that the poor planing<br />\n<br />\nof the concert was one of the<br />\nfactors leading to Baker's sudden<br />\nresignation. As vice-president of<br />\nthe Council, Baker was<br />\nresponsible for all social events<br />\nsponsored by the SC. She<br />\nreported that her resignation was<br />\nbased on \"personal\" reasons.<br />\nThe Youngbloods reportedly<br />\nreceived $4,500 payment for the<br />\nperformance. Gate receipts from<br />\n1,400 tickets would have<br />\ntotaled under $4,000.<br />\nAdditional expenses (building<br />\nrental, set-up costs) boosted the<br />\ntotal cost. \"If we had a sell-out<br />\ncrowd, we would still have lost<br />\nabout $500,\" Savitz said.<br />\n<br />\nJohn J.

According to<br />\nthe initial Board proposal,<br />\n<br />\nUrban Studies Dept.Pushed<br />\nBy JACKIE DOWD<br />\nStudents, faculty and Urban<br />\nAffairs workers met Sunday to<br />\ndiscuss present opportunities<br />\navailable to Urban Studies<br />\nmajors at Hopkins, including<br />\nthe possibility of forming an<br />\nUrban Studies Department.<br />\nJerry Doctrow, coordinator of<br />\nthe meeting, cited the need for<br />\nan Urban Studies Department.<br />\n\"\u2018The University has already<br />\nmade a commitment of<br />\nresponsibility to the city, but<br />\nhas done nothing to coordinate<br />\nwhat goes on. Although there<br />\nare presently many programs,<br />\nthings proceed in an unorganized<br />\nmanner,\" he said.<br />\nDoctrow explained, \"There<br />\nshould be a specific list of<br />\ncourses available to Urban<br />\nStudies majors, and this should<br />\nbe set up in a department. What<br />\nwe need in Urban Studies is<br />\nformality and continuity.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. Sol Levine, Director of<br />\nthe Center for Urban Affairs,<br />\ndisagreed with the idea of a<br />\nspecific Urban Studies<br />\nDepartment. \"Urban Studies cut<br />\nacross too many departments.<br />\nThere is already the Social<br />\nRelations Department and the<br />\nCenter for Urban Affairs where<br />\nprograms could be structured.<br />\nThere is no need for a specific<br />\ndepartment.\"<br />\nLevine continued, \"The<br />\nCenter wants to help students<br />\nget more structured programs<br />\nand also help them individually.<br />\nWhen students call we direct<br />\nthem to courses, research<br />\nprojects or any opportunities<br />\nwhich might be helpful to<br />\nthem.\" He added that he will<br />\nsend out the Center's News<br />\nSummary to interested students.<br />\nDr. Sherry Olson, Geography<br />\nand Environmental Engineering,<br />\nstated one of the problems was<br />\n<br />\nwould be easy to get a job<br />\nworking for an established<br />\nrestaurant with his reputation<br />\nbut he prefers doing things his<br />\nown way, so that he can<br />\nmaintain an intimate<br />\nrelationship with people who<br />\nappreciate the food and<br />\ncompany for what it is,<br />\nunpretentious and real.<br />\n<br />\nmost of the students at Hopkins<br />\nare pre-med, and those who are<br />\nnot do not realize that there<br />\ncould be an Urban Studies<br />\nprogram. This view was<br />\nsupported by many non-science<br />\nmajors who generally agreed that<br />\nthe pre-med orientation at<br />\nHdpkins<br />\nmakes it difficult to<br />\nfind out about programs such as<br />\nUrban Studies.<br />\nGood Program<br />\nDr. Peter Rossi, Social<br />\nRelations, discussed the<br />\npossibility for expansion by<br />\naddition of courses. He stated he<br />\nhad talked to Dean Sigmund<br />\nSuskind about some ideas, and<br />\nwas told to set up something<br />\nformal and present it to the<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\n\"What we need now to do is<br />\nset up an organizing committee<br />\nand draw up proposals,\" Rossi<br />\nconcluded.<br />\n<br />\nseniors interested in becoming<br />\ntrustees have to collect at least<br />\n25 senior names on a petition to<br />\nbe eligible for the election.<br />\n\"We want a recent alumnus<br />\nwith a younger viewpoint that<br />\nreflects the viewpoints of the<br />\nundergraduates,\" said senior<br />\nclass president Alfred Dimiero.<br />\nHe called for volunteers at the<br />\nsenior class meeting to compose<br />\na group that will piopose a<br />\nselection process.<br />\nThe selection process is yet to<br />\nbe determined, but Dimiero<br />\nindicated that meetings with<br />\nEisenhower and other<br />\nadministrators will yield a<br />\nmeaningful process of selection<br />\ninvolving some type of election.<br />\nMahinka, who now attends<br />\nHarvard Law School, stated last<br />\nyear, \"There probably should<br />\nhave been an election and in the<br />\nfuture there should be some<br />\ntype of student vote in the<br />\nselection process.\" The Board<br />\nwants a younger spokesman, and<br />\na vote will make him something<br />\nmore, according to Dimiero.<br />\nFull Members<br />\nThe two newly selected<br />\nalumni trustees serve as full<br />\nmembers of the Board for<br />\ntwo-year terms Their functions<br />\nare like those of any other Board<br />\nmember.<br />\nLast April, Eisenhower<br />\npointed out that the new<br />\nstudent Board members will be<br />\nserving when the final decision<br />\nabout the appointment of a new<br />\npresident is made.<br />\nSerious Seniors<br />\nThe group of seven seniors is<br />\nattempting to provide \"an input<br />\non how the selection process<br />\nshould be done,\" said Dimiero.<br />\nHe emphasized that the<br />\nmembers of this group are<br />\nseriously concerned with this<br />\nresponsibility.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nNov. 23, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNew Undergrad Science Journal Released<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.

But the narrowness of its proposed<br />\nstudent-faculty Central Committee and the grandiose<br />\nnature of some suggested reforms make revisions necessary<br />\nbefore their December 1 interim governance report is<br />\nreleased. The low participation so far in the committee's<br />\nmeetings point to the greatest danger facing the Student<br />\nCouncil in winning a new governance system: lack of<br />\nstudent support. Faculty and administration opposition to<br />\nmajor changes will, of course, be intense, and unless the<br />\nStudent Council'is willing to go through the hard work of<br />\ninteresting students in governance reform, nothing can be<br />\naccomplished.<br />\nRight now, it seems that the Governance Committee is<br />\nheaded towards an interim report that will call for a<br />\n17-member student-faculty committee with the power of<br />\nreview over Homewood's academic, non-academic and<br />\nbudgetary decisions. The proposed committee would best<br />\nserve the interests of both students and faculty if it<br />\nbecame more than a mere committee and was expanded to<br />\na University Senate, affording a wider representation and<br />\nbroader discussion of issues. This would tend to submerge<br />\nthe personality differences which have plagued the Student<br />\nCouncil this year. And having veto power over complex<br />\nfiscal affairs is a responsibility too overwhelming for<br />\npart-time policy-makers like students and faculty. But like<br />\nthe Academic Council now, a future University Senate<br />\nshould be fully incorporated into the fiscal<br />\ndecision-making process in an advisory capacity.<br />\nIn the other key areas of Arts and Sciences concern,<br />\nthough, there is no reason why a representative body for<br />\nstudents and faculty should not have veto power over<br />\nacademic and non-academic decisions, since they will be<br />\nthe ones most affected by them. A University Senate<br />\nwould not supplant other important decision - making<br />\ngroups on campus,such as the Academic Council, but only<br />\nmake them more responsive by having their decisions<br />\nreviewed by a body with broader representation. The main<br />\ntask before the Student Council now is coming up with a<br />\nrealizable plan that can unite students, as well as enlisting<br />\nthe support of faculty members and administrators<br />\ninterested in change.<br />\n<br />\nNov. 23, 1971<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\nLatest Moves On Checkerboard Square, Washington<br />\n<br />\nTo the editors :<br />\nI was very disappointed at the<br />\nlack of undergraduate<br />\neducational questioning<br />\ndisplayed at last Friday's<br />\nYoungbloods concert. Everyone<br />\nknows that the clever<br />\nundergraduate is not to take<br />\nthings at face value, but is<br />\nsupposed to ponder and to<br />\nconsider before taking action. It<br />\nwas very difficult to devise an<br />\nadequate thesis to carry the<br />\nYoungbloods' message through a<br />\nconcise fifteen pages. Fifteen<br />\npages of paper have to be filled<br />\nwith meaty thoughts, juicy<br />\nwriting, and a lack of fat.<br />\nOthei\u2022wise, one might be called<br />\nto account for his creation to<br />\nthe butcher who picked up his<br />\ncopy of the Gospel in the library<br />\nlast week. Nonetheless, it is clear<br />\nthat the thoughtful<br />\nundergraduate should not sit<br />\nback at a concert just listening<br />\nto the music, or digging the vibes<br />\nor putting the moves on the<br />\nluscious lovely under him. Nor<br />\nmust he strain to capture the<br />\nelusive butterfly which runs<br />\nthroughout all of his<br />\nnovels.(Everybody knows that<br />\nBob Lynn is an anagram of sorts<br />\nfor Vivian Thunderclap, or<br />\nVivian Bustwhistle, or Vivian<br />\nBratwurst.) Instead, this<br />\n<br />\nthoughtful undergrad must go<br />\nand cut the soles of his shoes. He<br />\nmust sit on a treelimb of course,<br />\nto ride the wind. But T-bone<br />\nshuffling out to the gym, our<br />\n<br />\nstudent hero is brought back<br />\nonce again to the reality of the<br />\nblank pages which confront him<br />\nin the visage.<br />\nLucretia L,eTreadmoore<br />\n<br />\nNew Party<br />\n<br />\nPlatform<br />\nAlternative<br />\nBased on the premise that the present major<br />\npolitical parties of the United States do not<br />\nadequately represent nor reflect the social,<br />\npolitical or economic views of a large segment of<br />\nthe American people, a new and different<br />\npolitical force has been organized. The<br />\nCoalition, as that force has been named, will<br />\nhold their National Convention in Dallas, Texas<br />\nNovember 24 through November 28, 1971.<br />\nThe coalition was formed over July 4th<br />\nweedend, 1971, at a meeting in Albuquerque,<br />\nNew Mexico. Participants from 25 states and<br />\nthe District of Columbia were present at the<br />\ninitial organizational meeting. They represented<br />\nthe New Party, Peace and Freedom Party,<br />\nHuman Rights Party, New Reform Party,<br />\nIndependent New Mexico Party, Liberal Party,<br />\nD.C. Statehood Party and the Wisconsin<br />\nAlliance.<br />\nA platform drafted at the Albuquerque<br />\nmeeting will presented at the National<br />\nConvention.

We are<br />\norganizing at every level to produce a new<br />\npolitical alternative based on grass-roots<br />\ndemocratic procedures, including electoral<br />\npolitics, counter institutions, and non-violent,<br />\ndirect action. Our goal is a new nation with<br />\nnew institutions controled by the people who<br />\nparticipate in them.\"<br />\nThe National Convention will also consider<br />\npossible candidates for United States President,<br />\nVice-President, and shadow cabinet. The agenda<br />\nincludes discussion of national structure. Of<br />\nthat topic, the preamble says: \"This new<br />\npolitical party recognizes the serious dangers of<br />\npolarization of our society and the alienation of<br />\nour people. We therefore dedicate ourselves to<br />\nthe proposition that whatever affects one<br />\nindividual must concern us all. We are more<br />\ncommitted to the next generation than to the<br />\nThis column was exerpted from the New<br />\nCoalition's platform.<br />\n<br />\nnext election.\"<br />\nThe document goes on to state: \"Our<br />\ncountry has drifted into a national mood that<br />\nneglects the working man and the poor, and has<br />\nfailed to respond to the people from which the<br />\nsource of government flows. Instead, our<br />\nleaders, public and private, put profits ahead of<br />\npeople and apply our national wealth toward<br />\nfurther economic expansion rather than<br />\nimproving the quality of all life.\"<br />\nThe Coalition sees no solution to national<br />\nproblems coming from either of the two major<br />\nnational parties. They claim that \"No effective<br />\neffort has been made by either the Republican<br />\nor Democratic party to reverse this national<br />\nmood.\"<br />\nAmong the accomplishments which the group<br />\nmade at the July meeting were the formulation<br />\nof statements which spell out their position on<br />\na number of topics. The far-reaching policies<br />\ncall for \"Immediate withdrawal of'U.S. troops<br />\nand armaments from all foreign countries...and the use of milirary force \"...only to defend<br />\nagainst direct attacks upon the country.\" The<br />\nproblems of the Coalition are based on what<br />\nthey call a \"frame-work of ecology.\" That<br />\nframework is defined as \"... the relationship of<br />\neach person and every living thing to each other<br />\nand their environment.\"<br />\nThe policy statements also deal with<br />\nEconomics, Education, Law and Justice, Health<br />\nCare and Personal Rreedoms. Of the latter, the<br />\ngroup says \"Individuals must take precedence<br />\nover institutions and property rights...We<br />\ncondemn restrictions which prevent individuals<br />\nand groups from living their lives as they<br />\nchoose, other than the minimal restrictions<br />\nnecessary to insure the same freedoms for<br />\nothers.\"<br />\nThe summation of the group's purpose is<br />\nfound in the conclusion of the preamble, which<br />\nsays:\"We shall strive to create a sense of national<br />\npurpose and higher standards of public behavior<br />\nand to make the machinery of government<br />\nresponsive to the people.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nphotos by<br />\ndave pickall<br />\n<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\n\"RCA didn't know what the<br />\nYoungbloods were.

That's why the<br />\nYoungbloods are now on Warner<br />\n<br />\nBrothers.<br />\n\"The crowd was great. They listened<br />\nwhen they were supposed to, and<br />\njumped around when they were<br />\nsupposed to do that,\" drummer Joe<br />\nBauer had said just a few minutes<br />\nearlier.<br />\nSaturday evening, out in the gym, the<br />\nYoungbloods had made that crowd do<br />\nwhat they were supposed to, playing the<br />\n1500 people like they were a fifth<br />\ninstrument.<br />\nSeemingly somewhat wined up, and<br />\nhyped in the wrong direction by the<br />\npseudo c &w first group (guitarist Jim<br />\nJones showed why he earned the<br />\nnickname \"Jumpin\" when he worked<br />\nfor the N-L), it looked like a bad crowd<br />\nfor the oh,so mellow Youngbloods. But<br />\na slow smooth \"Grizzly Bear,\" followed<br />\nby \"Darkness, Darkness,\" .and those<br />\npresent could only sit back and marvel<br />\nat real talent.<br />\n\"Sure I enjoyed it,\" Young said<br />\nafterwards. \"This is the first night on<br />\nthis tour and it's always nice to be back<br />\nplaying.\"<br />\nAnd, indeed, they did seem to be<br />\nenjoying themselves. Signed, to play for<br />\n90 minutes, the group stayed for over<br />\ntwo hours, the concert ending well after<br />\nmidnight.<br />\nWhen the crowd started to get<br />\nrestless, a little too much Boone's Farm<br />\nfor the Banana's smooth electric piano,<br />\nthe Youngbloods showed that they<br />\ncould do that shit too, and played some<br />\n<br />\nfantastic blues, allowing those so<br />\ninclined to attempt clapping in time.<br />\n\"Get Together,\" not a bit<br />\ndisappointing, and then, everybody up<br />\non their feet, they kept it going, the<br />\nblues,\"Beautiful,\" it was a fine time.<br />\nThey molded the audience seemingly<br />\nwith ease. Initial restlessness<br />\ndisappeared under a barrage of sweet<br />\nmusic. By the end, everyone was<br />\ngathered around and the Youngbloods<br />\nlevitated them about six inches with<br />\n\"Ride the Wind,\" one of the mellowest<br />\nsongs ever recorded. At that point no<br />\none seemed to mind that they couldn't<br />\nclap their hands and stomp their feet<br />\nand dance around in the back of the<br />\ngym, the yearnings of some earlier.<br />\nThere wasn't even anyone yelling out<br />\nfor a \"Boogie.\" People merely shuffled<br />\ntheir feet and drifted along.<br />\nNow it seemed like a small group of<br />\npeople. The Youngbloods had achieved<br />\na certain amount of intimacy, and they<br />\nannounced and played their last song, a<br />\nquick, nice \u2014T-Bone Shuffle,\" and then<br />\nleft.<br />\nAfterwards, they helped pack up<br />\ntheir equipment, and then sat around<br />\none of the -locker rooms and talked.<br />\nThere were no bizarre groupies, no<br />\nheavy dope, no pretentiousness. They<br />\ntalked of their sound that night,<br />\npossible experiments with Michael<br />\nKane's bass. They talked of the matters<br />\nof well-off bohemia, cameras and ,new<br />\nsound systems. Nice people who make<br />\n<br />\nnice music.<br />\n\"We've been together for seven<br />\nyears,\" Young was saying. \"Maybe it's<br />\nonly six, I don't know.\"<br />\nYoung is quick to smile, flashing his<br />\nfriendly eyes. It seems strange to hear<br />\nnormal conversation coming from the<br />\nvoice floated so beautifully across the<br />\ngym a few moments earlier.<br />\n\"I still enjoy it.

Pierre, with his thinning<br />\nslicked back hair dirty apron,<br />\nserves as waiter, lief de cuisine,<br />\nbusboy, cash register operator,<br />\nand as your friendly and<br />\ntalkative host. He is able to do<br />\nall these jobs because customers<br />\ndrift in very slowly and<br />\nirregularly. \"But it's not the<br />\nvolume of business you do that's<br />\nI mportant,\" says Pierre,\"it's the<br /><br />\nmoney you take home at the<br />\nend of the week.\"<br />\nPierre is very sensitive about<br />\nthe condition of his<br />\nestablishment. When he took it<br />\nover a year ago he had to invest<br />\nover $1200 to whip it into<br />\nworking order. But, he refuses to<br />\ndo more renovating since he is<br />\nonly renting the building.<br />\n\"At least my place is clean,if<br />\nanyone can find caked-on dirt or<br />\na cockroach I'll eat it,\" said<br />\nPierre.<br />\n\u2022 Finest<br />\nPierre reminisced, \"At one<br />\ntime I owned the finest<br />\nrestaurant in Baltimore, The<br />\nRestaurant Pierre.\" He bought<br />\nthe Baltimore restaurant<br />\nMaxim's in 1945, renamed it,<br />\nand it boasted the finest cuisine<br />\nin the area. If you ask he will<br />\npull out his briefcase filled with<br />\nnews clippings and autographed<br />\npictures of himself with such<br />\nnotables as Charles de Gaulle<br />\nand Edward G. Robinson, and<br />\nramble on for hours.<br />\nHe lost the establishment,<br />\nwhich was netting him $1,000 a<br />\nweek, because of a rape incident<br />\nin his parking lot at the 704 N.<br />\nHoward St. location, which<br />\neventually lead to his loss of<br /><br />\ncustomers and bankrupcy.<br />\n\"It was a story of going from<br />\nriches to rags,\" said Pierre.<br />\nBut Pierre knew poverty<br />\nbefore when he first came to this<br />\ncountry from Athens in 1922.<br />\nHe started his culinary career by<br />\nbusing tables in the Waldorf<br />\nAstoria in New York. But he<br />\nquickly rose to the post of chief<br />\nsteward on the Moore-McCormick Ocean Lines and to head<br />\nchef at the St. Regis in New<br />\nYork.<br />\nPierre, though he went to<br />\nschool for only three months,<br />\nclaims to know five languages<br />\nand he has taught himself<br />\ndifferent styles of cooking.<br />\n\"People don't care about the<br />\nstudents, but I have a great love<br />\nof learning and I would like to<br />\nsee and meet more Hopkins<br />\nstudents,\" said Pierre.<br />\nLoving Care<br />\nPierre treats those students he<br />\ndoes know with loving care and<br />\nprovides an extra helping of<br />\nmost dishes he serves. He has<br />\nestablished a small but<br />\nconsistent clientele who know<br />\nhim and come to partake of his<br />\ngood food, and conversation, all<br />\nfor a very moderate price.<br />\nThe food, which he describes<br /><br />\nConcert Loses Money<br />\nDespite relatively high<br />\nattendance, preliminary figures<br />\nI ndicate that Friday's<br />\nYoungbloods concert will lose<br />\nseveral thousand dollars.<br />\nAndrew Savitz, who<br />\ncoordinated the Student Council<br />\nSponsored concert, set the loss<br />\nfigure as \"at least $2,000.\" He<br />\nsaid that final expenditure totals<br />\nhave not yet been compiled.<br />\nSavitz reported that 1,400<br />\ntickets were sold for the event.<br />\n2,200 tickets would have<br />\nrepresented a sell-out. \"When I<br />\ntook over control of the concert,<br />\nno more than 40 tickets had<br />\nbeen sold,\" he said. Savitz had<br />\nearlier stated that the advance<br />\nPlanning of the concert was<br />\nPoorly done.<br />\nOn Their Own<br />\nThe Student Council, after<br />\ndeciding on Nov. 1 to curtail all<br />\ncooperation with the<br />\nadministration except on the<br />\ngovernance reform issue, elected<br />\nto run the concert on their own.<br />\nThey renounced administration<br />\nsupport, deciding to sponsor and<br />\nOperate the concert themselves.<br />\nThe Council's decision to run<br />\nthe event without school<br />\nsupport came on the heels of the<br />\nresignation of Esta Baker,<br />\nCouncil VP and Social<br />\nCommittee Chairman. The<br />\nresultant confusion lead many<br />\nCouncil members to estimate<br />\nthat losses from the<br />\nYoungbloods concert would<br />\ntotal over $4,000. Savitz then<br />\nvolunteered to run the event.<br />\nSavitz commented that the<br />\nlack of Administration support<br />\nfor the concert was not a factor<br />\nin the losswhich was incurred. \"I<br />\ndon't think that administration<br />\ncooperation could have helped<br />\nus any,\" he said. Savitz had<br /><br />\nearlier indicated that the turnout<br />\nwould be a measure of student<br />\nsupport for SC actions to cut<br />\nadministration ties.<br />\nMany Council members at the<br />\nNov. 1 meeting were opposed to<br />\ncontinuing the proposed<br />\nconcert, saying that the<br />\nprojected loss would be greater<br />\nthan the Council could afford.<br />\n\"If we lose a lot of money on<br />\nthis concert, it will shoot down<br />\nthe social events for the rest of<br />\nthe year,\" one member said.<br />\nSome Council members were<br />\ncritical of the manner in which<br />\nBaker handled the advance<br />\nplanning of the event. Some<br />\nspeculated that the poor planing<br /><br />\nof the concert was one of the<br />\nfactors leading to Baker's sudden<br />\nresignation. As vice-president of<br />\nthe Council, Baker was<br />\nresponsible for all social events<br />\nsponsored by the SC. She<br />\nreported that her resignation was<br />\nbased on \"personal\" reasons.<br />\nThe Youngbloods reportedly<br />\nreceived $4,500 payment for the<br />\nperformance. Gate receipts from<br />\n1,400 tickets would have<br />\ntotaled under $4,000.<br />\nAdditional expenses (building<br />\nrental, set-up costs) boosted the<br />\ntotal cost. \"If we had a sell-out<br />\ncrowd, we would still have lost<br />\nabout $500,\" Savitz said.<br /><br />\nJohn J.

What<br />\nwe need in Urban Studies is<br />\nformality and continuity.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Sol Levine, Director of<br />\nthe Center for Urban Affairs,<br />\ndisagreed with the idea of a<br />\nspecific Urban Studies<br />\nDepartment. \"Urban Studies cut<br />\nacross too many departments.<br />\nThere is already the Social<br />\nRelations Department and the<br />\nCenter for Urban Affairs where<br />\nprograms could be structured.<br />\nThere is no need for a specific<br />\ndepartment.\"<br />\nLevine continued, \"The<br />\nCenter wants to help students<br />\nget more structured programs<br />\nand also help them individually.<br />\nWhen students call we direct<br />\nthem to courses, research<br />\nprojects or any opportunities<br />\nwhich might be helpful to<br />\nthem.\" He added that he will<br />\nsend out the Center's News<br />\nSummary to interested students.<br />\nDr. Sherry Olson, Geography<br />\nand Environmental Engineering,<br />\nstated one of the problems was<br /><br />\nwould be easy to get a job<br />\nworking for an established<br />\nrestaurant with his reputation<br />\nbut he prefers doing things his<br />\nown way, so that he can<br />\nmaintain an intimate<br />\nrelationship with people who<br />\nappreciate the food and<br />\ncompany for what it is,<br />\nunpretentious and real.<br /><br />\nmost of the students at Hopkins<br />\nare pre-med, and those who are<br />\nnot do not realize that there<br />\ncould be an Urban Studies<br />\nprogram. This view was<br />\nsupported by many non-science<br />\nmajors who generally agreed that<br />\nthe pre-med orientation at<br />\nHdpkins<br />\nmakes it difficult to<br />\nfind out about programs such as<br />\nUrban Studies.<br />\nGood Program<br />\nDr. Peter Rossi, Social<br />\nRelations, discussed the<br />\npossibility for expansion by<br />\naddition of courses.

Science students now have an<br />\nopportunity to write about they<br />\nscientific interests and thus<br />\nstimulate another aspect of their<br />\neducation through the<br />\npublication of the Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate Science Bulletin.<br />\nJames Economou', a first year<br />\nmed student in the 2-5 program,<br />\nwho is editor of the Bulletin,<br />\nstated, \"We wanted to issue a<br />\njournal with science research<br />\narticles which undergraduates<br />\ncould read with ease.\"<br />\nHe explained that all previous<br />\nHopkins publications failed after<br />\nonly one or two issues, citing the<br />\nVector and the Charles St.<br />\nReview as examples. \"We<br />\nthought about what students<br />\nwould want to read, and since a<br />\nmajor portion of Hopkins<br /><br />\nundergraduates are science<br />\nmajors, we decided that a<br />\nscience bulletin would be<br />\nreceived well,\" said Economou.<br />\nSpecial Areas<br />\nDr. Saul Roseman, Biology<br />\nChairman and Faculty Advisor<br />\nfor the Bulletin said, \"I like to<br />\nsee undergraduates working in<br />\nspecial areas of science which<br />\naren't covered in their regular<br />\ncurriculum.

Judging from the<br />\nnumber of pre-meds and science<br />\nmajors at Hopkins, the bulletin<br />\nshould meet with success.\"<br />\nEconomou explained it was<br />\ndifficult to evaluate the success<br />\nof the Bulletin at this time. \"If<br />\nwe were determining success by<br />\nsales, the Bulletin would have to<br />\nbe termed unsuccessful.

But the narrowness of its proposed<br />\nstudent-faculty Central Committee and the grandiose<br />\nnature of some suggested reforms make revisions necessary<br />\nbefore their December 1 interim governance report is<br />\nreleased. The low participation so far in the committee's<br />\nmeetings point to the greatest danger facing the Student<br />\nCouncil in winning a new governance system: lack of<br />\nstudent support. Faculty and administration opposition to<br />\nmajor changes will, of course, be intense, and unless the<br />\nStudent Council'is willing to go through the hard work of<br />\ninteresting students in governance reform, nothing can be<br />\naccomplished.<br />\nRight now, it seems that the Governance Committee is<br />\nheaded towards an interim report that will call for a<br />\n17-member student-faculty committee with the power of<br />\nreview over Homewood's academic, non-academic and<br />\nbudgetary decisions. The proposed committee would best<br />\nserve the interests of both students and faculty if it<br />\nbecame more than a mere committee and was expanded to<br />\na University Senate, affording a wider representation and<br />\nbroader discussion of issues. This would tend to submerge<br />\nthe personality differences which have plagued the Student<br />\nCouncil this year. And having veto power over complex<br />\nfiscal affairs is a responsibility too overwhelming for<br />\npart-time policy-makers like students and faculty. But like<br />\nthe Academic Council now, a future University Senate<br />\nshould be fully incorporated into the fiscal<br />\ndecision-making process in an advisory capacity.<br />\nIn the other key areas of Arts and Sciences concern,<br />\nthough, there is no reason why a representative body for<br />\nstudents and faculty should not have veto power over<br />\nacademic and non-academic decisions, since they will be<br />\nthe ones most affected by them. A University Senate<br />\nwould not supplant other important decision - making<br />\ngroups on campus,such as the Academic Council, but only<br />\nmake them more responsive by having their decisions<br />\nreviewed by a body with broader representation. The main<br />\ntask before the Student Council now is coming up with a<br />\nrealizable plan that can unite students, as well as enlisting<br />\nthe support of faculty members and administrators<br />\ninterested in change.<br /><br />\nNov. 23, 1971<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\nLatest Moves On Checkerboard Square, Washington<br /><br />\nTo the editors :<br />\nI was very disappointed at the<br />\nlack of undergraduate<br />\neducational questioning<br />\ndisplayed at last Friday's<br />\nYoungbloods concert. Everyone<br />\nknows that the clever<br />\nundergraduate is not to take<br />\nthings at face value, but is<br />\nsupposed to ponder and to<br />\nconsider before taking action. It<br />\nwas very difficult to devise an<br />\nadequate thesis to carry the<br />\nYoungbloods' message through a<br />\nconcise fifteen pages. Fifteen<br />\npages of paper have to be filled<br />\nwith meaty thoughts, juicy<br />\nwriting, and a lack of fat.<br />\nOthei\u2022wise, one might be called<br />\nto account for his creation to<br />\nthe butcher who picked up his<br />\ncopy of the Gospel in the library<br />\nlast week. Nonetheless, it is clear<br />\nthat the thoughtful<br />\nundergraduate should not sit<br />\nback at a concert just listening<br />\nto the music, or digging the vibes<br />\nor putting the moves on the<br />\nluscious lovely under him. Nor<br />\nmust he strain to capture the<br />\nelusive butterfly which runs<br />\nthroughout all of his<br />\nnovels.(Everybody knows that<br />\nBob Lynn is an anagram of sorts<br />\nfor Vivian Thunderclap, or<br />\nVivian Bustwhistle, or Vivian<br />\nBratwurst.) Instead, this<br /><br />\nthoughtful undergrad must go<br />\nand cut the soles of his shoes. He<br />\nmust sit on a treelimb of course,<br />\nto ride the wind. But T-bone<br />\nshuffling out to the gym, our<br /><br />\nstudent hero is brought back<br />\nonce again to the reality of the<br />\nblank pages which confront him<br />\nin the visage.<br />\nLucretia L,eTreadmoore<br /><br />\nNew Party<br /><br />\nPlatform<br />\nAlternative<br />\nBased on the premise that the present major<br />\npolitical parties of the United States do not<br />\nadequately represent nor reflect the social,<br />\npolitical or economic views of a large segment of<br />\nthe American people, a new and different<br />\npolitical force has been organized. The<br />\nCoalition, as that force has been named, will<br />\nhold their National Convention in Dallas, Texas<br />\nNovember 24 through November 28, 1971.<br />\nThe coalition was formed over July 4th<br />\nweedend, 1971, at a meeting in Albuquerque,<br />\nNew Mexico. Participants from 25 states and<br />\nthe District of Columbia were present at the<br />\ninitial organizational meeting. They represented<br />\nthe New Party, Peace and Freedom Party,<br />\nHuman Rights Party, New Reform Party,<br />\nIndependent New Mexico Party, Liberal Party,<br />\nD.C. Statehood Party and the Wisconsin<br />\nAlliance.<br />\nA platform drafted at the Albuquerque<br />\nmeeting will presented at the National<br />\nConvention. The preamble to that platform<br />\nstates: \"Independent political parties in many<br />\nstates are now uniting to provide a national<br />\nchallenge to the existing system. We are<br />\norganizing at every level to produce a new<br />\npolitical alternative based on grass-roots<br />\ndemocratic procedures, including electoral<br />\npolitics, counter institutions, and non-violent,<br />\ndirect action. Our goal is a new nation with<br />\nnew institutions controled by the people who<br />\nparticipate in them.\"<br />\nThe National Convention will also consider<br />\npossible candidates for United States President,<br />\nVice-President, and shadow cabinet. The agenda<br />\nincludes discussion of national structure. Of<br />\nthat topic, the preamble says: \"This new<br />\npolitical party recognizes the serious dangers of<br />\npolarization of our society and the alienation of<br />\nour people. We therefore dedicate ourselves to<br />\nthe proposition that whatever affects one<br />\nindividual must concern us all. We are more<br />\ncommitted to the next generation than to the<br />\nThis column was exerpted from the New<br />\nCoalition's platform.<br /><br />\nnext election.\"<br />\nThe document goes on to state: \"Our<br />\ncountry has drifted into a national mood that<br />\nneglects the working man and the poor, and has<br />\nfailed to respond to the people from which the<br />\nsource of government flows. Instead, our<br />\nleaders, public and private, put profits ahead of<br />\npeople and apply our national wealth toward<br />\nfurther economic expansion rather than<br />\nimproving the quality of all life.\"<br />\nThe Coalition sees no solution to national<br />\nproblems coming from either of the two major<br />\nnational parties. They claim that \"No effective<br />\neffort has been made by either the Republican<br />\nor Democratic party to reverse this national<br />\nmood.\"<br />\nAmong the accomplishments which the group<br />\nmade at the July meeting were the formulation<br />\nof statements which spell out their position on<br />\na number of topics. The far-reaching policies<br />\ncall for \"Immediate withdrawal of'U.S. troops<br />\nand armaments from all foreign countries...and the use of milirary force \"...only to defend<br />\nagainst direct attacks upon the country.\" The<br />\nproblems of the Coalition are based on what<br />\nthey call a \"frame-work of ecology.\" That<br />\nframework is defined as \"... the relationship of<br />\neach person and every living thing to each other<br />\nand their environment.\"<br />\nThe policy statements also deal with<br />\nEconomics, Education, Law and Justice, Health<br />\nCare and Personal Rreedoms. Of the latter, the<br />\ngroup says \"Individuals must take precedence<br />\nover institutions and property rights...We<br />\ncondemn restrictions which prevent individuals<br />\nand groups from living their lives as they<br />\nchoose, other than the minimal restrictions<br />\nnecessary to insure the same freedoms for<br />\nothers.\"<br />\nThe summation of the group's purpose is<br />\nfound in the conclusion of the preamble, which<br />\nsays:\"We shall strive to create a sense of national<br />\npurpose and higher standards of public behavior<br />\nand to make the machinery of government<br />\nresponsive to the people.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nphotos by<br />\ndave pickall<br /><br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\n\"RCA didn't know what the<br />\nYoungbloods were. They thought we<br />\nwere some sort of bubble-gum group.\"<br />\nsaid Jesse Colin Young before<br />\ndisappearing into the bathroom marked<br />\n\"Visitors.\" Young and the three<br />\nmembers of his group had just<br />\ndemonstrated that they were far from<br />\nbubble-gum status. That's why the<br />\nYoungbloods are now on Warner<br /><br />\nBrothers.<br />\n\"The crowd was great.

But<br />\na slow smooth \"Grizzly Bear,\" followed<br />\nby \"Darkness, Darkness,\" .and those<br />\npresent could only sit back and marvel<br />\nat real talent.<br />\n\"Sure I enjoyed it,\" Young said<br />\nafterwards. \"This is the first night on<br />\nthis tour and it's always nice to be back<br />\nplaying.\"<br />\nAnd, indeed, they did seem to be<br />\nenjoying themselves. Signed, to play for<br />\n90 minutes, the group stayed for over<br />\ntwo hours, the concert ending well after<br />\nmidnight.<br />\nWhen the crowd started to get<br />\nrestless, a little too much Boone's Farm<br />\nfor the Banana's smooth electric piano,<br />\nthe Youngbloods showed that they<br />\ncould do that shit too, and played some<br /><br />\nfantastic blues, allowing those so<br />\ninclined to attempt clapping in time.<br />\n\"Get Together,\" not a bit<br />\ndisappointing, and then, everybody up<br />\non their feet, they kept it going, the<br />\nblues,\"Beautiful,\" it was a fine time.<br />\nThey molded the audience seemingly<br />\nwith ease. Initial restlessness<br />\ndisappeared under a barrage of sweet<br />\nmusic. By the end, everyone was<br />\ngathered around and the Youngbloods<br />\nlevitated them about six inches with<br />\n\"Ride the Wind,\" one of the mellowest<br />\nsongs ever recorded. At that point no<br />\none seemed to mind that they couldn't<br />\nclap their hands and stomp their feet<br />\nand dance around in the back of the<br />\ngym, the yearnings of some earlier.<br />\nThere wasn't even anyone yelling out<br />\nfor a \"Boogie.\" People merely shuffled<br />\ntheir feet and drifted along.<br />\nNow it seemed like a small group of<br />\npeople. The Youngbloods had achieved<br />\na certain amount of intimacy, and they<br />\nannounced and played their last song, a<br />\nquick, nice \u2014T-Bone Shuffle,\" and then<br />\nleft.<br />\nAfterwards, they helped pack up<br />\ntheir equipment, and then sat around<br />\none of the -locker rooms and talked.<br />\nThere were no bizarre groupies, no<br />\nheavy dope, no pretentiousness. They<br />\ntalked of their sound that night,<br />\npossible experiments with Michael<br />\nKane's bass. They talked of the matters<br />\nof well-off bohemia, cameras and ,new<br />\nsound systems.

Officer<br />\nHitchcock checks the situation with the<br />\nPinkertons on duty for the concert.<br />\nHitchcock is sixtyish, but, talkative,<br /><br />\nchipper and very conscientious about<br />\nhis job.<br />\nAt 10 pm, Unit One rolls by the<br />\nwell-lit freshmen dorms and down to<br />\nthe ROTC building. When the car passes<br />\nthrough the gates, past the gray,<br />\nwooden structure, two people can be<br />\nseen sitting against the back of the<br />\nAthletic Center passing a joint. When<br />\nthey see the car they casually get up and<br />\nwalk around front, as if they had<br />\nnothing to worry about. Hitchcock gets<br />\nout of the car and goes up after them,<br />\nbut by the time he makes his way up<br />\nthe wet, cement steps the pair is gone<br />\nand all he finds is a box of burnt<br />\nmatches. Getting back in the car he<br />\nmumbles, \"They had enough matches<br />\nup there to start a bonfire\u2014 I wonder<br />\nwhat they were doing.\"<br />\n\"Unit one.

The patrolmen on foot are<br />\nmaking their rounds and when they see<br />\nthe car, they seem anxious to talk to<br />\nsomeone. The man checking the faculty<br />\nclub said he found a door open, but that<br />\neverything else was fine. All the.<br />\nwatchmen carry walkie-talkies and can<br /><br />\ncontact the patrol car at any time.<br />\nShift Changes<br />\nAt 11 pm, the car winds its way back<br />\nto the security office in Whitehead Hall<br />\nand the shift changes. Thirteen men<br />\nstand packed together in the 9' by 10'<br />\noffice, exchanging radios and punching<br />\nthe time clock.<br />\nAfter the shift changes, Officer Bill<br />\nDeese takes over the patrol car: He is<br />\nmiddle-aged and talks a lot about his<br />\ntwo sons in the Navy.<br />\nFor what seems about the hundredth<br />\ntime, he checks the Rodgers House,<br />\nHomewood House, and Wolman Hall.<br />\nBy this time the concert has broken up<br />\nand a steady stream of cars leave the<br />\ncampus. A few couples walk arm in arm<br />\ntowards the dorms or their cars and the<br />\ncampus begins to quiet down.<br />\n\"Unit one to post one- come in<br />\nplease.\"<br />\n\"Post one here.\"<br />\n\"Have you been Levering yet?\"<br />\n\"Yeah, everything's quiet.\"<br />\n\"O.K.

The cold has moved in and<br />\nthe few people on Charles Street move<br />\nquickly toward the warmth of their<br />\nhomes and beds. Deese is checking the<br />\ncomputer center in Garland Hall, the<br />\nlights shining down the sides making it<br />\nstand out under the crystal clear, starry<br />\nsky.<br />\nLights remain on in some of the<br />\ncampus buildings where the janitors are<br />\nhard at work mopping the floors and<br />\nwashing the blackboards covered with<br />\nwhite dust.<br />\nMoving slowly around the perimeter<br />\nof campus, Deese stops to put up<br />\nbarricades for the football game the<br />\nnext day. He moves quickly in the cold,<br />\nwearing only a sweater. When he gets<br />\nback in the car he seems refreshed and<br />\nwide awake, despite the fact that it is<br />\nthree o'clock in the morning.
