We are<br />\na cross section of the community. And, as<br />\nsuch, running a corporation is not our<br />\nprofession. We haven't had a lot of<br />\npractice at it.

If you want<br />\na corporation that will not make such<br />\nmistakes then you'll have to have a Board<br />\nof Directors like banks or prestigious<br />\nuniversities have. But then, we've been<br />\nwaiting for them to confront social<br />\nproblems for a long time.<br />\nThe background with which the<br />\nNews-Letter published the editorial of<br />\nOctober 10 needs to be questioned.

To put<br />\n<br />\nWilliamsburg, Virginia is far away from the Hopkins<br />\ncampus, and indeed, that is why it was chosen as the<br />\nsite of the weekend's semi-annual meeting of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees. As President Muller said earlier in<br />\nthe year, the Board met away from the campus, with<br />\nthe Hospital's Board, so they could start Centennial<br />\nplanning, among other things. One of those things was<br />\nthe passage of the $300 tuition rise. Although one<br />\ntrustee commented, \"The trustees really did care<br />\nabout it,\" their simply caring is not going to do much<br />\nfor the undergraduate who has to find the extra<br />\nmoney almost a year from now. There was talk of<br />\n\"hard economic realities\" forcing the increase, but no<br />\none did anything more than talk about what a problem<br />\na tuition rise would cause for the 2000<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nAll this sounds a little strange when one hears talk<br />\nof Hopkins raising .$150 million in the coming<br />\ncentennial campaign, while undergraduates are being<br />\nasked to balance the University's books to the tune of<br />\n$600,000. And an administrator said recently that<br />\nHopkins couldn't stop paying stipends to graduate<br />\nstudents, because otherwise, the grad students would<br />\ngo somewhere else to school. The Trustees did<br />\nquestion that statement, but the tuition will still rise.<br />\nMaybe Williamsburg is too far away.<br />\n<br />\nthe NUS Corporation, the International<br />\nBank for Reconstruction and<br />\nDevelopment, etc.<br />\nNotable by their total absence are<br />\nserious opponents to the present<br />\nregime--those who might think, for<br />\nexample, that the counter-revolution<br />\nunder way in Brazil deserves at least equal<br />\nbilling with its \"economic miracle,\"<br />\nparticularly since we have previously<br />\nheard in the 1960's of \"economic<br />\nmiracles\" in South Vietnam and South<br />\nKorea.<br />\nThese sessions of the symposium, we<br />\nbelieve, bring shame to Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe symposium demonstrates how<br />\nUniversity auspices can be used to<br />\nlegitimize support for American<br />\nimperialism. It further demonstrates,<br />\nshould any proof be needed, the<br />\nnecessary and prevailing ideological biases<br />\nin an institution supposedly dedicated to<br />\nindependent scholarship.<br />\nThe symposium will be held at<br />\nEvergreen House, its final sessions at 2<br />\npm and 4 pm, on Thursday, October 19,<br />\n<br />\nBy SUE BLUM and BILL ABBOTT<br />\nWe've seen better, and the Barn has,<br />\ntoo.

As a heavy-set, beared<br />\nJewish uncle sort, Torsch was<br />\nincrongruously cast into the minor role of<br />\nHome Secretary in King Magnus' cabinet.<br />\nHis antics of inebriation, including<br />\nslapstick facial contortions, grunt, and a .<br />\nvery stiff upper lip added humor and<br />\nstrength to the interplays between King<br />\nand cabinet. So powerful was the Balbus<br />\n<br />\ncharacter that it detracted from<br />\nimportant political soliloquies by<br />\nprotagonists, holding the audience captive<br />\nin anticipation of another amusing<br />\ngrimace.<br />\nThe first of two acts portrays a<br />\ndissident cabinet attempting to connive<br />\nthe King to signing over his already<br />\nfragmented power. But in the style of<br />\nmuch more recent leaders, King Magnus<br />\ndemonstrates that one man can manipulate<br />\na body of men (and women) much better<br />\nthan vice versa, even though they are both<br />\nhopelessly inept. In the second act, Magnus<br />\nmaintains his domination in spite of the<br />\ncabinet's demand for democracy by<br />\nthreatening to abdicate totally, to run for<br />\nthe House of Commons, and to have<br />\nhimself annointed by parliament to the<br />\nPresidency.<br />\nTechnical flaws sapped strength from<br />\n<br />\nAcv.i Vwc\u2018<br />\n<br />\nkilow there was<br />\ncontacted.<br />\ndope in the House.

This editorial misrepresents<br />\nboth the purpose and the nature of the<br />\nHouse Center program as it has been<br />\noperating during the past seven months.<br />\nRather than being a \"drug rehabilitation<br />\nprogram,\" as your editorial refers to, we<br />\nare, a drug education and preverion<br />\nprogram which seeks to provide<br />\nmeaningful alternatives to drug use to the<br />\nyouth of the Remington community. If<br />\nour files had been consulted, rather than.<br />\ncharging that we have \"been rinae to<br />\nprovide any of the drug conseling\" for<br />\nwhich we were funded, the clear<br />\nover 100 individual recorded cases of<br />\ndrug ard drug related problems being<br />\nhandled by the Center since May 1972,<br />\nwould have come forth. Conversation<br />\nwith any member of the staff would have<br />\nbrought forth the fact that we serve 120<br />\nyouths from the area, an average of 50<br />\nyouth utilizing the drop-in recreational<br />\nfacilities of the Center in any one day.<br />\nThe facts are that an epidemic of glue<br />\nsniffing in our community has been<br />\nstifled sirp.-! the Center opened and that a<br />\nhalf dozen cases could be cited where<br />\nyouth were turned away from hard drug<br />\nuse before they got past the experimental<br />\nstage.<br />\nIn addition, we wish to publicly<br />\ndisagree with the allegation that Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire \"has not indicated that<br />\nhe has a real grasp of the problem.\"<br />\nRather, we feel that such individuals as<br />\nDr. Wickwire should be held up as<br />\nexamples of meaningful participation by<br />\nUniversity resources in the attempt to<br />\ndeal with community problems. His<br />\nefforts, and the efforts of the Student<br />\nAssociation and CODE, which are<br />\naffiliated with the Chaplain's Office, have<br />\nprovided much of the administrative<br />\nknowledge, information, and above all<br />\nhumanitariap concern which are<br />\nnecessary to establish a community<br />\ncorporation and attack drug abuse on a<br />\npreventative level. I feel that the<br />\nunfortunate incident involving the two<br />\nsuspended staff members should not be<br />\nased either to attack Dr. Wickwire or to<br />\n<br />\ndealing with 20th century Brazil, and<br />\ncharmingly entitled \"Modern Brazil, the<br />\neconomic miracle\" and \"Modern Brazil,<br />\nthe country of the future,\" that could<br />\nnot and should not have been put on<br />\ninstead by AID, in conjunction with the<br />\nvarious banks, corporations and<br />\nfoundations interested in foreign trade.<br />\nBut by Johns Hopkins University?<br />\nWe would go further and disagree with<br />\nthe entire commemorative aspect of the<br />\nconference. We find it slightly obscene<br />\nthat Hopkins should sponsor a<br />\nsymposium celebrating Brazilian<br />\nindependence from Portugal, for<br />\ncenturies a has-been imperialist power,<br />\nwhile the people of Brazil are ruled by a<br />\nfascist dictatorship and Brazil itself is a<br />\ntrading and investment colony of the U.S.<br />\nOur distaste in this respect is enhanced by<br />\nthe participation in the conference of the<br />\nAmbassador of Brazil and the First<br />\nSecretary of the Brazilian Embassy.<br />\nDistaste builds to outrage when the<br />\ninstitutional affiliations of participants in<br />\nthese sessions are analyzed. Participants,<br />\nwith few exceptions, do not even enjoy.<br />\nthe appearnce of independence. They<br />\ncome predominantly from such neutral,<br />\nscholarly organizations as the First<br />\nNational Bank of Maryland, the Equitable<br />\nTrust Company, the U.S. Department of<br />\nCommerce, the Export-Import Bank of<br />\nthe U.S., the U.S. Department of State,<br />\n<br />\nRic Pfeffer<br />\nDavid Harvey<br />\n<br />\nHousemasters<br />\nand Serena<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was surprised to read of the dispute<br />\nbetween Colonel Serena and<br />\nex-housemaster Boehlke; my surprise was<br />\nthe greater since I am supposedly a<br />\nprincipal in this dispute. I won't repeat<br />\nthe usual about being quoted out of<br />\ncontext. It just isn't worth the effort.<br />\nWhat should be made clear is that I<br />\nbelieve Colonel Serena does an excellent<br />\njob with far too limited staff and funding<br />\nand that the housemaster perform<br />\noutstanding service to the resident<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\n\u2022 What then is the basis of my<br />\ncomments?

Unorganized prop<br />\nshifts by the stage crew, bad phone<br />\nconnections between the stage booth and<br />\ndressing room, and faulty recording<br />\nequipment were terribly obvious.<br />\nDouglas Tillett and W. P. Ellis<br />\nperformed admirably in their respective<br />\nroles as the American Ambassador (from<br />\nTexas) and Boanerges, the Archie Bunker<br />\nlabor leader. The Ambassador, replete<br />\nwith 10-gallon hat,red, white, and blue tie,<br />\nand Henry Gibson accent, provided a<br />\nperfect contrast to the inbredetiquette of<br />\nthe English monarch. Boanerges, the<br />\nnaive commoner accidently ascended to<br />\nthe Chair of the Board of Trade,<br />\namplified Magnus' monarchial control<br />\nwith cockney rhetoric reminiscent of Liza<br />\nDoolitle's father in My Fair Lady.<br />\nThe Ambassador and Boanerges<br />\ntogether offered legitimate excuses for<br />\naudience sympathy siding with the King.<br />\nAnd Magnus, with the help of Robert<br />\nWalsh's striking resemblance to Chet<br />\nr e onc, 'agnus was as. )nvincing 0 the<br />\naudience as he was to his cabinet.

Traveling to Hoplcins<br />\nfrom the suburbs of Philadelphia<br />\nthe Garnets arrived at<br />\nHomewood with a record no<br />\nbetter than that of the Blue Jay<br />\nteam. Swarthmore had lost the<br />\nonly two games of their season.<br />\nTheir two opponents, however,<br />\nwere the nationally ranked<br />\nteams, Penn and Princeton. The<br />\nQuakers, defeated Swarthmore<br />\nby a score of 5-1, while Princeton<br />\nhad triumphed with a 6-1 margin.<br />\nkly'r \u201e<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jays wanted to win<br />\nthis game as would any team who<br />\nhad a zero in their winning<br />\ncolumn. Last year when the Jays<br />\ntravelled to Philly with<br />\n\u2022Swarthmore as their host, they<br />\nwere defeated by one goal which<br />\ncame with fifty seconds left in<br />\nthe second period of overtime.<br />\nThe final score was 2-1.<br />\nThe crowded stands saw<br />\nSwarthmore take an early lead in<br />\nthe first half when their senior<br />\nstar, Wally Ramsey, headed a ball<br />\nreceived from his teammate, Sam<br />\nAgger, in a corner kick situation.<br />\nThe ball was placed well away<br />\nfrom the Blue Jay goalie,<br />\nfreshman Jack Bukowski, who<br />\n<br />\nRoberto Arguero dashes into the midst ofthe enemy pursuing the ball<br />\n<br />\nwas starting in his second varsity<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nA half hour went by with no<br />\nactual domination by either<br />\nteam. Swarthmore had doubled<br />\nthe number of shots taken by the<br />\nBlue Jays, only half of which<br />\nwere actually on the goal. With<br />\nten minutes remaining in the first<br />\nhalf, junior Larry Schall caught<br />\nthe Hopkins defense off guard<br />\nand drilled in a shot from 18<br />\nyards to the far corner of the<br />\ngoal past Bukowski which gave<br />\nSwarthmore a 2-0 lead.<br />\nNo Control<br />\nThe second half started much<br />\nthe same as the first half except<br />\nthat Hopkins seemed to have<br />\nlittle edge as far as ball control<br />\ngoes. The scoring ice of the<br />\nsecond half was finally broken<br />\nwhen junior Ken Cohen crossed<br />\nthe ball from the right side of the<br />\nfield to the waiting foot of Wally,<br />\nRamsey in the middle of the field I><br />\nwho fired the ball into the left<br />\nside of the net. With the score<br />\n3-0, the Jays couldn't figure out<br />\nwhat was wrong. They were<br />\nplaying good ball, their passes<br />\nwere accurate, their defense was<br />\nstrong, and their shots were<br />\nclose. The only thing that didn't<br />\nshow all this was the scoreboard.<br />\nFinally with nineteen minutes<br />\nleft to go in the game, freshman<br />\nBruce Cazenave drew the<br />\nSwarthmore goalie, Shalit,put of<br />\nthe goal before passing to junior<br />\nRoberto Arguero, who placed the<br />\n<br />\nWorld Series jinx hits Cincinnati<br />\nBy MICHAEL BERESTON<br />\nWith Oakland two games<br />\nahead and the World Series<br />\nshifting to the west coast,<br />\nCincinatti fans can sit back and<br />\nwonder why their team is<br />\nsnake-bitten once again in the<br />\nOctober classic.<br />\nIn 1970, Reds pitching was<br />\nsolid all year, then fell apart in<br />\nthe World Series. A lot had to do<br />\nwith sore pitching arms and in<br />\n1972, sore arms could tell the<br />\nstory again.<br />\nSomehow though, one gets th\u20ac<br />\nfeeling that the Reds, were over<br />\nconfident at the start of this<br />\nseries, particularly since the A's<br />\nReggie! Jackson was lost with a<br />\npulled hamstring muscle. Still the<br />\nAmerican League was supposed<br />\nto be asking such questions as<br />\nwhether Joe Morgan really was<br />\nfaster than a speeding bullet or<br />\nwas that cannon attached to<br />\nJohnny Bench's right shoulder<br />\nreally his throwing arm? The A's<br />\ndecided not to ask anything and<br />\nthe Reds are now forced to take<br />\ntwo out of the next three in<br />\nOakland to bring the series back<br />\nto Cincinatti.<br />\nOne has to wonder how the<br />\nA's personnel actually did pull off<br />\nthe first two wins. The first game<br />\nmight be considered an upset<br />\nwith Holtzman, Fingers and Blue<br />\nturning in excellent pitching<br />\nperformances, but when Hunter<br />\nand Fingers stopped the Reds<br />\nagain in game two, the thought<br />\nfinally occurred that maybe<br />\nOakland pitching is going to nail<br />\nthe Reds in their coffin for the<br />\nrest of the series. If someone<br />\n<br />\nfinds that hard to believe with<br />\nCincinnati boasting a lineup of<br />\nRose, Morgan, Tolan, Bench,<br />\nPerez, Menke and Geronimo,<br />\nthen they are not aware of the<br />\npowers of great pitching. If the<br />\nReds can muster no more than<br />\none or two runs a game, which<br />\nmight be the case with Odom and<br />\nBlue scheduled to pitch the next<br />\ntwo outings, then Cincinnati is in<br />\nbig trouble. It would put<br />\nimmense pressure on the Reds'<br />\npitching to avoid any mistakes at<br />\nall - Nolan made two all last<br />\nSaturday and it cost him three<br />\nruns.<br />\nWhen pitching is that tight,<br />\n\u2022 then suddenly people take notice of<br />\nthe electrically charged<br />\natmosphere which erupts with<br />\nevery hit and gives lesser knowns<br />\na sounding board to show off<br />\ntheir baseball prowess . Who<br />\ncould have imagined that a<br />\ncatcher with the unlikely name<br />\nof Gene Tenace would blast game<br />\nwinning home runs in his first<br />\ntwo World Series at bats? But the<br />\nhistory of the World Series is<br />\nfilled with Gene Tenaces and<br />\ntight ball games only mean more<br />\nto come.<br />\n- Big Plays<br />\nIn 1970, the Reds did<br />\neverything they could just to<br />\nsmack a baseball through Brooks<br />\nRobinson. They failed, bu,<br />\neveryone agreed that no on\u20ac<br />\nwould ever equal Robinson'<br />\nfeat.

We are<br />\na cross section of the community. And, as<br />\nsuch, running a corporation is not our<br />\nprofession. We haven't had a lot of<br />\npractice at it.

To put<br /><br />\nWilliamsburg, Virginia is far away from the Hopkins<br />\ncampus, and indeed, that is why it was chosen as the<br />\nsite of the weekend's semi-annual meeting of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees. As President Muller said earlier in<br />\nthe year, the Board met away from the campus, with<br />\nthe Hospital's Board, so they could start Centennial<br />\nplanning, among other things. One of those things was<br />\nthe passage of the $300 tuition rise. Although one<br />\ntrustee commented, \"The trustees really did care<br />\nabout it,\" their simply caring is not going to do much<br />\nfor the undergraduate who has to find the extra<br />\nmoney almost a year from now. There was talk of<br />\n\"hard economic realities\" forcing the increase, but no<br />\none did anything more than talk about what a problem<br />\na tuition rise would cause for the 2000<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nAll this sounds a little strange when one hears talk<br />\nof Hopkins raising .$150 million in the coming<br />\ncentennial campaign, while undergraduates are being<br />\nasked to balance the University's books to the tune of<br />\n$600,000. And an administrator said recently that<br />\nHopkins couldn't stop paying stipends to graduate<br />\nstudents, because otherwise, the grad students would<br />\ngo somewhere else to school. The Trustees did<br />\nquestion that statement, but the tuition will still rise.<br />\nMaybe Williamsburg is too far away.<br /><br />\nthe NUS Corporation, the International<br />\nBank for Reconstruction and<br />\nDevelopment, etc.<br />\nNotable by their total absence are<br />\nserious opponents to the present<br />\nregime--those who might think, for<br />\nexample, that the counter-revolution<br />\nunder way in Brazil deserves at least equal<br />\nbilling with its \"economic miracle,\"<br />\nparticularly since we have previously<br />\nheard in the 1960's of \"economic<br />\nmiracles\" in South Vietnam and South<br />\nKorea.<br />\nThese sessions of the symposium, we<br />\nbelieve, bring shame to Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe symposium demonstrates how<br />\nUniversity auspices can be used to<br />\nlegitimize support for American<br />\nimperialism. It further demonstrates,<br />\nshould any proof be needed, the<br />\nnecessary and prevailing ideological biases<br />\nin an institution supposedly dedicated to<br />\nindependent scholarship.<br />\nThe symposium will be held at<br />\nEvergreen House, its final sessions at 2<br />\npm and 4 pm, on Thursday, October 19,<br /><br />\nBy SUE BLUM and BILL ABBOTT<br />\nWe've seen better, and the Barn has,<br />\ntoo.

As a heavy-set, beared<br />\nJewish uncle sort, Torsch was<br />\nincrongruously cast into the minor role of<br />\nHome Secretary in King Magnus' cabinet.<br />\nHis antics of inebriation, including<br />\nslapstick facial contortions, grunt, and a .<br />\nvery stiff upper lip added humor and<br />\nstrength to the interplays between King<br />\nand cabinet. So powerful was the Balbus<br /><br />\ncharacter that it detracted from<br />\nimportant political soliloquies by<br />\nprotagonists, holding the audience captive<br />\nin anticipation of another amusing<br />\ngrimace.<br />\nThe first of two acts portrays a<br />\ndissident cabinet attempting to connive<br />\nthe King to signing over his already<br />\nfragmented power. But in the style of<br />\nmuch more recent leaders, King Magnus<br />\ndemonstrates that one man can manipulate<br />\na body of men (and women) much better<br />\nthan vice versa, even though they are both<br />\nhopelessly inept. In the second act, Magnus<br />\nmaintains his domination in spite of the<br />\ncabinet's demand for democracy by<br />\nthreatening to abdicate totally, to run for<br />\nthe House of Commons, and to have<br />\nhimself annointed by parliament to the<br />\nPresidency.<br />\nTechnical flaws sapped strength from<br /><br />\nAcv.i Vwc\u2018<br /><br />\nkilow there was<br />\ncontacted.<br />\ndope in the House.

This editorial misrepresents<br />\nboth the purpose and the nature of the<br />\nHouse Center program as it has been<br />\noperating during the past seven months.<br />\nRather than being a \"drug rehabilitation<br />\nprogram,\" as your editorial refers to, we<br />\nare, a drug education and preverion<br />\nprogram which seeks to provide<br />\nmeaningful alternatives to drug use to the<br />\nyouth of the Remington community. If<br />\nour files had been consulted, rather than.<br />\ncharging that we have \"been rinae to<br />\nprovide any of the drug conseling\" for<br />\nwhich we were funded, the clear<br />\nover 100 individual recorded cases of<br />\ndrug ard drug related problems being<br />\nhandled by the Center since May 1972,<br />\nwould have come forth. Conversation<br />\nwith any member of the staff would have<br />\nbrought forth the fact that we serve 120<br />\nyouths from the area, an average of 50<br />\nyouth utilizing the drop-in recreational<br />\nfacilities of the Center in any one day.<br />\nThe facts are that an epidemic of glue<br />\nsniffing in our community has been<br />\nstifled sirp.-! the Center opened and that a<br />\nhalf dozen cases could be cited where<br />\nyouth were turned away from hard drug<br />\nuse before they got past the experimental<br />\nstage.<br />\nIn addition, we wish to publicly<br />\ndisagree with the allegation that Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire \"has not indicated that<br />\nhe has a real grasp of the problem.\"<br />\nRather, we feel that such individuals as<br />\nDr. Wickwire should be held up as<br />\nexamples of meaningful participation by<br />\nUniversity resources in the attempt to<br />\ndeal with community problems. His<br />\nefforts, and the efforts of the Student<br />\nAssociation and CODE, which are<br />\naffiliated with the Chaplain's Office, have<br />\nprovided much of the administrative<br />\nknowledge, information, and above all<br />\nhumanitariap concern which are<br />\nnecessary to establish a community<br />\ncorporation and attack drug abuse on a<br />\npreventative level. I feel that the<br />\nunfortunate incident involving the two<br />\nsuspended staff members should not be<br />\nased either to attack Dr. Wickwire or to<br /><br />\ndealing with 20th century Brazil, and<br />\ncharmingly entitled \"Modern Brazil, the<br />\neconomic miracle\" and \"Modern Brazil,<br />\nthe country of the future,\" that could<br />\nnot and should not have been put on<br />\ninstead by AID, in conjunction with the<br />\nvarious banks, corporations and<br />\nfoundations interested in foreign trade.<br />\nBut by Johns Hopkins University?<br />\nWe would go further and disagree with<br />\nthe entire commemorative aspect of the<br />\nconference. We find it slightly obscene<br />\nthat Hopkins should sponsor a<br />\nsymposium celebrating Brazilian<br />\nindependence from Portugal, for<br />\ncenturies a has-been imperialist power,<br />\nwhile the people of Brazil are ruled by a<br />\nfascist dictatorship and Brazil itself is a<br />\ntrading and investment colony of the U.S.<br />\nOur distaste in this respect is enhanced by<br />\nthe participation in the conference of the<br />\nAmbassador of Brazil and the First<br />\nSecretary of the Brazilian Embassy.<br />\nDistaste builds to outrage when the<br />\ninstitutional affiliations of participants in<br />\nthese sessions are analyzed. Participants,<br />\nwith few exceptions, do not even enjoy.<br />\nthe appearnce of independence. They<br />\ncome predominantly from such neutral,<br />\nscholarly organizations as the First<br />\nNational Bank of Maryland, the Equitable<br />\nTrust Company, the U.S. Department of<br />\nCommerce, the Export-Import Bank of<br />\nthe U.S., the U.S. Department of State,<br /><br />\nRic Pfeffer<br />\nDavid Harvey<br /><br />\nHousemasters<br />\nand Serena<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was surprised to read of the dispute<br />\nbetween Colonel Serena and<br />\nex-housemaster Boehlke; my surprise was<br />\nthe greater since I am supposedly a<br />\nprincipal in this dispute.

The Ambassador, replete<br />\nwith 10-gallon hat,red, white, and blue tie,<br />\nand Henry Gibson accent, provided a<br />\nperfect contrast to the inbredetiquette of<br />\nthe English monarch.

Traveling to Hoplcins<br />\nfrom the suburbs of Philadelphia<br />\nthe Garnets arrived at<br />\nHomewood with a record no<br />\nbetter than that of the Blue Jay<br />\nteam. Swarthmore had lost the<br />\nonly two games of their season.<br />\nTheir two opponents, however,<br />\nwere the nationally ranked<br />\nteams, Penn and Princeton. The<br />\nQuakers, defeated Swarthmore<br />\nby a score of 5-1, while Princeton<br />\nhad triumphed with a 6-1 margin.<br />\nkly'r \u201e<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jays wanted to win<br />\nthis game as would any team who<br />\nhad a zero in their winning<br />\ncolumn. Last year when the Jays<br />\ntravelled to Philly with<br />\n\u2022Swarthmore as their host, they<br />\nwere defeated by one goal which<br />\ncame with fifty seconds left in<br />\nthe second period of overtime.<br />\nThe final score was 2-1.<br />\nThe crowded stands saw<br />\nSwarthmore take an early lead in<br />\nthe first half when their senior<br />\nstar, Wally Ramsey, headed a ball<br />\nreceived from his teammate, Sam<br />\nAgger, in a corner kick situation.<br />\nThe ball was placed well away<br />\nfrom the Blue Jay goalie,<br />\nfreshman Jack Bukowski, who<br /><br />\nRoberto Arguero dashes into the midst ofthe enemy pursuing the ball<br /><br />\nwas starting in his second varsity<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nA half hour went by with no<br />\nactual domination by either<br />\nteam. Swarthmore had doubled<br />\nthe number of shots taken by the<br />\nBlue Jays, only half of which<br />\nwere actually on the goal. With<br />\nten minutes remaining in the first<br />\nhalf, junior Larry Schall caught<br />\nthe Hopkins defense off guard<br />\nand drilled in a shot from 18<br />\nyards to the far corner of the<br />\ngoal past Bukowski which gave<br />\nSwarthmore a 2-0 lead.<br />\nNo Control<br />\nThe second half started much<br />\nthe same as the first half except<br />\nthat Hopkins seemed to have<br />\nlittle edge as far as ball control<br />\ngoes. The scoring ice of the<br />\nsecond half was finally broken<br />\nwhen junior Ken Cohen crossed<br />\nthe ball from the right side of the<br />\nfield to the waiting foot of Wally,<br />\nRamsey in the middle of the field I&gt;<br />\nwho fired the ball into the left<br />\nside of the net. With the score<br />\n3-0, the Jays couldn't figure out<br />\nwhat was wrong. They were<br />\nplaying good ball, their passes<br />\nwere accurate, their defense was<br />\nstrong, and their shots were<br />\nclose. The only thing that didn't<br />\nshow all this was the scoreboard.<br />\nFinally with nineteen minutes<br />\nleft to go in the game, freshman<br />\nBruce Cazenave drew the<br />\nSwarthmore goalie, Shalit,put of<br />\nthe goal before passing to junior<br />\nRoberto Arguero, who placed the<br /><br />\nWorld Series jinx hits Cincinnati<br />\nBy MICHAEL BERESTON<br />\nWith Oakland two games<br />\nahead and the World Series<br />\nshifting to the west coast,<br />\nCincinatti fans can sit back and<br />\nwonder why their team is<br />\nsnake-bitten once again in the<br />\nOctober classic.<br />\nIn 1970, Reds pitching was<br />\nsolid all year, then fell apart in<br />\nthe World Series. A lot had to do<br />\nwith sore pitching arms and in<br />\n1972, sore arms could tell the<br />\nstory again.<br />\nSomehow though, one gets th\u20ac<br />\nfeeling that the Reds, were over<br />\nconfident at the start of this<br />\nseries, particularly since the A's<br />\nReggie! Jackson was lost with a<br />\npulled hamstring muscle. Still the<br />\nAmerican League was supposed<br />\nto be asking such questions as<br />\nwhether Joe Morgan really was<br />\nfaster than a speeding bullet or<br />\nwas that cannon attached to<br />\nJohnny Bench's right shoulder<br />\nreally his throwing arm? The A's<br />\ndecided not to ask anything and<br />\nthe Reds are now forced to take<br />\ntwo out of the next three in<br />\nOakland to bring the series back<br />\nto Cincinatti.<br />\nOne has to wonder how the<br />\nA's personnel actually did pull off<br />\nthe first two wins. The first game<br />\nmight be considered an upset<br />\nwith Holtzman, Fingers and Blue<br />\nturning in excellent pitching<br />\nperformances, but when Hunter<br />\nand Fingers stopped the Reds<br />\nagain in game two, the thought<br />\nfinally occurred that maybe<br />\nOakland pitching is going to nail<br />\nthe Reds in their coffin for the<br />\nrest of the series. If someone<br /><br />\nfinds that hard to believe with<br />\nCincinnati boasting a lineup of<br />\nRose, Morgan, Tolan, Bench,<br />\nPerez, Menke and Geronimo,<br />\nthen they are not aware of the<br />\npowers of great pitching. If the<br />\nReds can muster no more than<br />\none or two runs a game, which<br />\nmight be the case with Odom and<br />\nBlue scheduled to pitch the next<br />\ntwo outings, then Cincinnati is in<br />\nbig trouble. It would put<br />\nimmense pressure on the Reds'<br />\npitching to avoid any mistakes at<br />\nall - Nolan made two all last<br />\nSaturday and it cost him three<br />\nruns.<br />\nWhen pitching is that tight,<br />\n\u2022 then suddenly people take notice of<br />\nthe electrically charged<br />\natmosphere which erupts with<br />\nevery hit and gives lesser knowns<br />\na sounding board to show off<br />\ntheir baseball prowess . Who<br />\ncould have imagined that a<br />\ncatcher with the unlikely name<br />\nof Gene Tenace would blast game<br />\nwinning home runs in his first<br />\ntwo World Series at bats?
