WASHINGTON<br />\nVarsity Forges Ahead toward End of<br />\nGame, Administering 4-2 Defeat to<br />\nHillmen\u2014Captain Baxley Continues Steady Shooting.<br />\n<br />\nThe Varsity lacrosse team<br />\ngained a well-earned victory on<br />\nSaturday, April 20, over the Mt.<br />\nWashington club by a score of<br />\n4 to 2. The game was fast and<br />\nclean from start to finish, both<br />\nsides showing flashes of brilliant<br />\nplaying, and it was the sort of<br />\ncontest which will popularize<br />\nthe sport here.<br />\nThe Hillmen aggregation was<br />\ncomposed of former stars from<br />\nSwarthmore, University of Penn,<br />\nsylvania, and Hopkins, and despite the lack of consistent team<br />\nplay, their individual work was<br />\nof the highest order, forcing the<br />\n'Varsity to extend itself to the<br />\nlimit. The Hopkins team, however, was greatly weakened by<br />\nthe absence of Sutton and Silberstein who were prevented from<br />\nstarting<br />\n' on account of injuries<br />\nsustained in the Navy, game.<br />\nDaugherty also was absent, but<br />\nSadtler, who took his place at<br />\ngoal, made a very creditable<br />\nshowing.<br />\nBauernschmidt, who started the<br />\ngame at first attack, made the<br />\nfirst score after four minutes of<br />\nplay. The visitors Were not long<br />\nin evening matters, Johnny<br />\nKnipp, netting the ball with the<br />\ntying goal, as a result of splendid<br />\nattack work on the part of Mt.<br />\nWashington. From then on to<br />\nthe end of the half, it was a seesaw affair with honors about<br />\neven.<br />\nThe second half produced an<br />\neven better brand of lacrosse,<br />\nand frequent shots at goal were<br />\nmade by each side, but none entered the net. Finally, Gail shot<br />\none past Sadtler, and it seemed<br />\nthat there would be no more<br />\nscoring. At this point Silberstein was sent in for Bauerenschmidt, and the Hopkins attack<br />\ntook a new lease on life. Baxley<br />\ngot two goals in rapid succession, and Hoffman netted one just<br />\nbefore the whistle blew.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\nMt.

As<br />\nthe score indicates, the game was<br />\ndecidedly one-sided, and State<br />\nwas clearly outclassed. It was<br />\noriginally arranged for Penn<br />\nstate to play, but at the last<br />\nmoment they were forced to<br />\nabandon their trip, and Maryland State was asked to act as<br />\nsubstitutes.<br />\nFrom the start, it was evident<br />\nthat it would be merely a question of how large the score would<br />\nbe, although for a while State<br />\ngamely prevented _ any score.<br />\nBut after Blum shot the first<br />\ngoal, eight others followed in<br />\nrapid, succession making the<br />\nscore at the end of the first half<br />\n9 to 0. During the entire first<br />\nhalf the pall was in State territory and the 'Varsity attack had<br />\nlittle trouble out-playing their<br />\nopponents. Superior stick-work<br />\nand a better knowledge of the<br />\nfiner points of the game gave<br />\nHopkins a decided advantage in<br />\nteam work, with which their opponents could not cope.<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nRELAY TEAM BREAKS RECORD<br />\nVan Ness, Driver, Bartels, and Smith<br />\nCapture Championship of Southern<br />\nStates, Smashing Previous S.<br />\nA. 1. A. A. Records.<br />\n<br />\nAt one of the largest track<br />\nmeets ever held by the University<br />\nof Pennsylvania, the Hopkins relay team established a new record in the S. A. I. A. A. for the<br />\nmile relay. This is the third<br />\ntime that the championship of<br />\nthe southern states has come to<br />\nBaltimore, the team having taken<br />\nfirst place at the Penn Relay<br />\nCarnival in 1918, at the Second<br />\nRegiment Indoor Games at Baltimore in 1919, and again at Philadelphia on Saturday, April 26.<br />\nAlthough the absence of Firor<br />\nwas a great loss to the team, J.<br />\nBartels substituted in a very able<br />\nstyle. The team traveling up to<br />\nPhiladelphia consisted of Captain<br />\nB. Smith, A. Taylor, W. Driver,<br />\nJ. Bartels, and B. VanNess, together with Coach England. The<br />\nother entries in the S. A. I. A. A.<br />\nmile relay were Georgetown and<br />\nCatholic University.<br />\nVan Ness ran as first man for<br />\nHopkins, and<br />\nalthough<br />\nthe<br />\nGeorgetown runner dropped his<br />\nbaton, there was an appreciable<br />\ngain handed to Driver, the second of the Hopkins quartet.<br />\nDriver, running a great race,<br />\nmore than held his own, and was<br />\nable to give a lead of some three<br />\nyards to Bartels, who added another yard by the end of his<br />\nquarter. Captain Smith, even<br />\nthough greatly handicapped by a<br />\nstrained tendon in his leg, had<br />\nthings all his own way on the<br />\nlast lap and crossed the finish<br />\nline ten yards ahead of Georgetown. The time of the team,<br />\nwhich broke the S. A. I. A.

The scoring<br />\nwas practically the duplicate of<br />\nthat of 1918, minus the points<br />\nwhich the absence of Firor forfeited.<br />\nB. Smith and Guy Leadbetter<br />\nwere the two highest point winners for Hopkins, the former with<br />\nfirsts in the 440-yard dash and<br />\nhalf-mile run, the latter pulling<br />\n10 points with a first in the shot<br />\nand in the discus, breaking the<br />\nHopkins record in this event with<br />\na throw of 125 feet 8/<br />\n1<br />\n2 inches.<br />\nThe surprise of the meet was the<br />\nwinning of first place in the high<br />\nhurdles by R.

Although Captain Smith and Leadbetter won<br />\ntheir usual two first places apiece,<br />\nwith three places counting, the<br />\nNavy men had no competition for<br />\nsecond or third places in many of<br />\nthe events. There was excellent<br />\ntime made in the mile and halfmile runs, considering the slow<br />\ntrack.<br />\nThe Navy results follow: Smith<br />\nfirst in the 100 and 440 yard<br />\ndashes.

It is suggested<br />\nthat the first contest of the league<br />\nwill probably take place in 1920.<br />\nPending the formation of a definite and permanent constitution a<br />\ntentative agreement has lieen submitted. It provides that the business of the League shall be conducted by an executive committee<br />\ncomposed of one member of the<br />\nfaculty of each of the institutions<br />\naccepting this agreement.<br />\nOnly persons who are pursuing<br />\nundergraduate studies at the time<br />\nof the contest and who have not<br />\nreceived academic degrees shall<br />\nbe admitted as competitors.<br />\nSpeeches must not exceed twenty<br />\nminutes in delivery, and must<br />\ndeal with political, social, or economic subjects of current interest. Extempore speaking shall be<br />\nagreed to be preferable to speaking from memory. Prizes shall<br />\nbe awarded at the discretion of<br />\nthe executive committee.<br />\nCopies of this tentative agreement are being sent to the following universities beside Hopkins:<br />\nVanderbilt University, University<br />\nof Tennessee, University of Alabama, University of Virginia,<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina,<br />\nUniversity of Kentucky.<br />\nSpring Football Practice Progresses.<br />\n<br />\nSpring football practiCe on the<br />\nlower field is now well under way,<br />\nas far as other sports and activities will permit. At present it<br />\nis possible to hold only two field<br />\nwork-outs each week, for a number of men who would otherwise<br />\nbe out at these practices are engaged in some spring sport.<br />\nAs soon as the spring sports<br />\nare over, the last game scheduled<br />\nis May 24th, the tryouts for the<br />\nfall training camp will be held.<br />\nDuring this period of three weeks<br />\nbefore the undergraduate examinations are held, the entire squad<br />\nwill be expected out for light but<br />\nintensive work-outs daily.<br />\nThe plan now on foot is to pick<br />\nfrom these men a certain number<br />\nwho are showing up well and<br />\nworking faithfully to go to an<br />\nearly camp to be held during September. The advantages these<br />\nmen will have over the others are<br />\nonly too obvious, and it is not<br />\nimpossible that the entire 'Varsity may be picked from their<br />\nnumber. The benefits which Hopkins will get are equally obvious.<br />\n<br />\nMANY OFFICERS VISIT UNIT;<br />\n\"R.0. T. C. EXCHANGE\" STARTED.<br />\n<br />\nWithin the last few weeks the<br />\nR. 0. T. C. has begun preparations for the annual inspection,<br />\nhas been visited by many officers<br />\nfrom other colleges, and has<br />\nstarted \"The R. 0. T. C. Exchange.\"<br />\nThe unit is being worked into<br />\nshape for the annual Government<br />\ninspection to be held on May 19<br />\nand 20. Col. J. B. Douglas, of<br />\nthe General Staff, will be the reviewing officer. The whole R. 0.<br />\nT. C. will be called out for two<br />\ndays previous to the inspection,<br />\nin order thoroughly to drill the<br />\nmen, and it will remain out for<br />\nthe entire two days of the inspection.<br />\nA number of officers have recently visited the University to<br />\nfind out the details of the organization of the R. O. T. C. unit<br />\nhere. In a visitors' book that was<br />\nrecently begun appear the following names: Col. S. R. Bull, Lieut.Col. Alex M. Hall and Lieut.-Col.<br />\nR. Butler, from the Third District headquarters at Philadelphia; Second Lieut. Stanley S.<br />\nWohl, commandant of the Grove<br />\nCity College R. 0. T. C.;'and._<br />\nMajor G. A. Matile, commandant<br />\nof the Maryland State College R.<br />\n0. T. C.<br />\nThe new \"R. 0. T. C. Exchange\"<br />\nis a periodical published \"with a<br />\nview to awakening interest in an<br />\nexchange periodical devoted to the<br />\ninterests of the R. 0. T. C. of the<br />\ncountry.\" For the time being this<br />\npaper is published bi-monthly,<br />\nfree of charge, by the George Banta Publishing Company. The first<br />\nnumber was largely devoted to the<br />\nHopkins R. 0. T. C. Subsequent<br />\nissues are to be dedicated to the<br />\nR. 0. T. C.'s of other colleges.<br />\nThere is to be a slight charge<br />\nfor the paper later on, and it is<br />\nhoped that before long the paper<br />\nwill be self-supporting. If each<br />\nof the 300 R. 0. T. C. units were<br />\nto subscribe to only 10 copies per<br />\nissue of the \"Exchange,\" the paper could be made a self-supporting monthly.<br />\nJunior Class Banquet to be Held<br />\nMay 19th.<br />\n<br />\nAt the last meeting of the Junion Class, held Tuesday, April 15,<br />\nthe plans of the Banquet Committee were explained in detail by<br />\nGeorge Wagner.

The Haverford<br />\nMandolin club included some accomplished players of the banjo,<br />\nxylophone, and traps, as well a<br />\nfull set of mandolins and violins.<br />\nTheir Glee club likewise gave a<br />\nmost creditable exhibition of<br />\ntheir powers over the elusive note.<br />\nThe Hopkins club gave only<br />\nfour of the numbers, but it was<br />\nhard to realize that the organization had been in existence less<br />\nthan three months. All of the<br />\ncredit is due to Director Bochau,<br />\nwho has worked untiringly with<br />\nthe students. The best number<br />\nwas the Haverford \"Victory<br />\nMarch,\" by the mandolin club.<br />\nThe \"Anaesthetic\" dancing was<br />\nboth extremely original and<br />\nhighly amusing.<br />\nThe dancing that followed fully<br />\ncame up to all expectations. The<br />\nchairs flew out of the hall in a<br />\nmanner fearful and wonderful to<br />\nbehold, the floor being ready be:<br />\nfore the orchestra was.

The game was fast and<br />\nclean from start to finish, both<br />\nsides showing flashes of brilliant<br />\nplaying, and it was the sort of<br />\ncontest which will popularize<br />\nthe sport here.<br />\nThe Hillmen aggregation was<br />\ncomposed of former stars from<br />\nSwarthmore, University of Penn,<br />\nsylvania, and Hopkins, and despite the lack of consistent team<br />\nplay, their individual work was<br />\nof the highest order, forcing the<br />\n'Varsity to extend itself to the<br />\nlimit. The Hopkins team, however, was greatly weakened by<br />\nthe absence of Sutton and Silberstein who were prevented from<br />\nstarting<br />\n' on account of injuries<br />\nsustained in the Navy, game.<br />\nDaugherty also was absent, but<br />\nSadtler, who took his place at<br />\ngoal, made a very creditable<br />\nshowing.<br />\nBauernschmidt, who started the<br />\ngame at first attack, made the<br />\nfirst score after four minutes of<br />\nplay. The visitors Were not long<br />\nin evening matters, Johnny<br />\nKnipp, netting the ball with the<br />\ntying goal, as a result of splendid<br />\nattack work on the part of Mt.<br />\nWashington. From then on to<br />\nthe end of the half, it was a seesaw affair with honors about<br />\neven.<br />\nThe second half produced an<br />\neven better brand of lacrosse,<br />\nand frequent shots at goal were<br />\nmade by each side, but none entered the net. Finally, Gail shot<br />\none past Sadtler, and it seemed<br />\nthat there would be no more<br />\nscoring. At this point Silberstein was sent in for Bauerenschmidt, and the Hopkins attack<br />\ntook a new lease on life.

As<br />\nthe score indicates, the game was<br />\ndecidedly one-sided, and State<br />\nwas clearly outclassed.

During the entire first<br />\nhalf the pall was in State territory and the 'Varsity attack had<br />\nlittle trouble out-playing their<br />\nopponents. Superior stick-work<br />\nand a better knowledge of the<br />\nfiner points of the game gave<br />\nHopkins a decided advantage in<br />\nteam work, with which their opponents could not cope.<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nRELAY TEAM BREAKS RECORD<br />\nVan Ness, Driver, Bartels, and Smith<br />\nCapture Championship of Southern<br />\nStates, Smashing Previous S.<br />\nA. 1.

This is the third<br />\ntime that the championship of<br />\nthe southern states has come to<br />\nBaltimore, the team having taken<br />\nfirst place at the Penn Relay<br />\nCarnival in 1918, at the Second<br />\nRegiment Indoor Games at Baltimore in 1919, and again at Philadelphia on Saturday, April 26.<br />\nAlthough the absence of Firor<br />\nwas a great loss to the team, J.<br />\nBartels substituted in a very able<br />\nstyle. The team traveling up to<br />\nPhiladelphia consisted of Captain<br />\nB. Smith, A. Taylor, W. Driver,<br />\nJ. Bartels, and B. VanNess, together with Coach England. The<br />\nother entries in the S. A. I. A. A.<br />\nmile relay were Georgetown and<br />\nCatholic University.<br />\nVan Ness ran as first man for<br />\nHopkins, and<br />\nalthough<br />\nthe<br />\nGeorgetown runner dropped his<br />\nbaton, there was an appreciable<br />\ngain handed to Driver, the second of the Hopkins quartet.<br />\nDriver, running a great race,<br />\nmore than held his own, and was<br />\nable to give a lead of some three<br />\nyards to Bartels, who added another yard by the end of his<br />\nquarter. Captain Smith, even<br />\nthough greatly handicapped by a<br />\nstrained tendon in his leg, had<br />\nthings all his own way on the<br />\nlast lap and crossed the finish<br />\nline ten yards ahead of Georgetown.

Full<br />\nrecognition should be accorded<br />\nthe labors of those who have had<br />\nthe initiative to organize a club<br />\nwhich, in its first year, can put<br />\nforth a production which draws<br />\nsuch unlimited praise from those<br />\nwho have seen recent rehearsals.<br />\nThere is not alone the incentive of Hopkins loyalty, but far<br />\nmore that of pure enjoyment.<br />\nJust picture three of our heroes<br />\nportraying female roles\u2014and sh<br />\nthey . say two of them are extremely good-looking.

Umpire\u2014Boone.<br /><br />\nINVITED TO JOIN SOUTHERN<br />\nORATORICAL LEAGUE<br /><br />\nIn a letter to Dr. John C.<br />\nFrench from Dr. Edward C.<br />\nMabie of the University of Kentucky, Johns Hopkins has been<br />\ninvited to enter a Southern Oratorical League. It is suggested<br />\nthat the first contest of the league<br />\nwill probably take place in 1920.<br />\nPending the formation of a definite and permanent constitution a<br />\ntentative agreement has lieen submitted. It provides that the business of the League shall be conducted by an executive committee<br />\ncomposed of one member of the<br />\nfaculty of each of the institutions<br />\naccepting this agreement.<br />\nOnly persons who are pursuing<br />\nundergraduate studies at the time<br />\nof the contest and who have not<br />\nreceived academic degrees shall<br />\nbe admitted as competitors.<br />\nSpeeches must not exceed twenty<br />\nminutes in delivery, and must<br />\ndeal with political, social, or economic subjects of current interest. Extempore speaking shall be<br />\nagreed to be preferable to speaking from memory. Prizes shall<br />\nbe awarded at the discretion of<br />\nthe executive committee.<br />\nCopies of this tentative agreement are being sent to the following universities beside Hopkins:<br />\nVanderbilt University, University<br />\nof Tennessee, University of Alabama, University of Virginia,<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina,<br />\nUniversity of Kentucky.<br />\nSpring Football Practice Progresses.<br /><br />\nSpring football practiCe on the<br />\nlower field is now well under way,<br />\nas far as other sports and activities will permit. At present it<br />\nis possible to hold only two field<br />\nwork-outs each week, for a number of men who would otherwise<br />\nbe out at these practices are engaged in some spring sport.<br />\nAs soon as the spring sports<br />\nare over, the last game scheduled<br />\nis May 24th, the tryouts for the<br />\nfall training camp will be held.<br />\nDuring this period of three weeks<br />\nbefore the undergraduate examinations are held, the entire squad<br />\nwill be expected out for light but<br />\nintensive work-outs daily.<br />\nThe plan now on foot is to pick<br />\nfrom these men a certain number<br />\nwho are showing up well and<br />\nworking faithfully to go to an<br />\nearly camp to be held during September. The advantages these<br />\nmen will have over the others are<br />\nonly too obvious, and it is not<br />\nimpossible that the entire 'Varsity may be picked from their<br />\nnumber. The benefits which Hopkins will get are equally obvious.<br /><br />\nMANY OFFICERS VISIT UNIT;<br />\n\"R.0. T. C. EXCHANGE\" STARTED.<br /><br />\nWithin the last few weeks the<br />\nR. 0. T. C. has begun preparations for the annual inspection,<br />\nhas been visited by many officers<br />\nfrom other colleges, and has<br />\nstarted \"The R. 0. T. C. Exchange.\"<br />\nThe unit is being worked into<br />\nshape for the annual Government<br />\ninspection to be held on May 19<br />\nand 20. Col. J. B. Douglas, of<br />\nthe General Staff, will be the reviewing officer. The whole R. 0.<br />\nT. C. will be called out for two<br />\ndays previous to the inspection,<br />\nin order thoroughly to drill the<br />\nmen, and it will remain out for<br />\nthe entire two days of the inspection.<br />\nA number of officers have recently visited the University to<br />\nfind out the details of the organization of the R. O. T. C. unit<br />\nhere. In a visitors' book that was<br />\nrecently begun appear the following names: Col. S. R. Bull, Lieut.Col. Alex M. Hall and Lieut.-Col.<br />\nR. Butler, from the Third District headquarters at Philadelphia; Second Lieut. Stanley S.<br />\nWohl, commandant of the Grove<br />\nCity College R. 0. T. C.;'and._<br />\nMajor G. A. Matile, commandant<br />\nof the Maryland State College R.<br />\n0. T. C.<br />\nThe new \"R. 0. T. C. Exchange\"<br />\nis a periodical published \"with a<br />\nview to awakening interest in an<br />\nexchange periodical devoted to the<br />\ninterests of the R. 0. T. C. of the<br />\ncountry.\" For the time being this<br />\npaper is published bi-monthly,<br />\nfree of charge, by the George Banta Publishing Company. The first<br />\nnumber was largely devoted to the<br />\nHopkins R. 0. T. C. Subsequent<br />\nissues are to be dedicated to the<br />\nR. 0. T. C.'s of other colleges.<br />\nThere is to be a slight charge<br />\nfor the paper later on, and it is<br />\nhoped that before long the paper<br />\nwill be self-supporting. If each<br />\nof the 300 R. 0. T. C. units were<br />\nto subscribe to only 10 copies per<br />\nissue of the \"Exchange,\" the paper could be made a self-supporting monthly.<br />\nJunior Class Banquet to be Held<br />\nMay 19th.<br /><br />\nAt the last meeting of the Junion Class, held Tuesday, April 15,<br />\nthe plans of the Banquet Committee were explained in detail by<br />\nGeorge Wagner.

The Haverford<br />\nMandolin club included some accomplished players of the banjo,<br />\nxylophone, and traps, as well a<br />\nfull set of mandolins and violins.<br />\nTheir Glee club likewise gave a<br />\nmost creditable exhibition of<br />\ntheir powers over the elusive note.<br />\nThe Hopkins club gave only<br />\nfour of the numbers, but it was<br />\nhard to realize that the organization had been in existence less<br />\nthan three months. All of the<br />\ncredit is due to Director Bochau,<br />\nwho has worked untiringly with<br />\nthe students. The best number<br />\nwas the Haverford \"Victory<br />\nMarch,\" by the mandolin club.<br />\nThe \"Anaesthetic\" dancing was<br />\nboth extremely original and<br />\nhighly amusing.<br />\nThe dancing that followed fully<br />\ncame up to all expectations. The<br />\nchairs flew out of the hall in a<br />\nmanner fearful and wonderful to<br />\nbehold, the floor being ready be:<br />\nfore the orchestra was.
