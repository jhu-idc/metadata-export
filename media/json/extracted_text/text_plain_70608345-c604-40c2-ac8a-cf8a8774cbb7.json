This is to<br />\neliminate muddle resulting from<br /><br />\nthe Homewood's multitude of organizations attempting to control violations in restricted areas<br />\n(e.g. fraternities, dormitories)<br />\nand lack of a general body to<br />\nsystematize the entire undergraduate school.<br />\nThe Student Government discussion revealed that theStudent<br />\nCouncil is a \"frustrated coordinator of campus groups.\" It has<br />\nevidently delegated its own responsibilities too widely over the<br />\npast few years and now is left<br />\nwith little effective coordination<br />\npowers on campus.

Well, sir, \"dormitory\" is<br />\nLatin for \"bed of pain\".<br />\nNext, let us discuss student-teacher relationships. In college<br />\nthe keynote of the relationship between student and teacher is<br />\ninformality. When you meet a teacher on campus, you need<br />\nnot salute. Simply tug your forelock. If you are bald and have<br />\nno forelock, a low curtsey will suffice. In no circumstances<br />\nshould you polish a teacher's car or sponge and press his suit.<br />\nIt is, however, permissible to worm his dog.<br />\nWith the President of the University, of course, your relationship will be a bit more formal. When you encounter the President, fling yourself prone on the sidewalk and sing loudly:<br />\n!`Prery is wise<br />\nPrexy is true<br />\nPrexy has eyes<br />\nOf Lake Louise blue.\"<br /><br />\nAs you can see, the President of the University is tailed<br />\n\"Prexy\". Similarly, Deans are called \"Dixie\". Professors are<br />\ncalled \"Proxie\". Housemothers are called \"Hbxie Moxie\".<br />\nStudents are called \"Amoebae\".<br /><br />\nWELCOME FRESHMEN<br /><br />\nPAPERBOUND BOOKS<br />\n\u2014 Most Complete Stock In Baltimore \u2014<br />\nGENERAL BOOKS OF CURRENT INTEREST<br />\nTECHNICAL AND REFERENCE BOOKS<br />\nTEXTBOOKS NEW AND USED<br /><br />\nALSO<br /><br />\nNOTEBOOKS &amp; BINDERS<br />\nSTATIONERY<br /><br />\nFOUNTAIN PENS &amp; PENCILS<br />\nLAB SUPPLIES<br /><br />\nGREETING CARDS<br /><br />\nPAPERS<br /><br />\nENGINEERING SUPPLIES<br /><br />\nHOPKINS SOUVENIRS<br /><br />\nTHE JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE<br /><br />\nOD 1961 Mal Shulinem<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nThis uncensored, free-wheeling column will be brought to<br />\nyou throughout the school year by the makers of Marlboro<br />\nand Marlboro's partner in pleasure, the new, unfiltered,<br />\nking-size Philip Morris Commander.
