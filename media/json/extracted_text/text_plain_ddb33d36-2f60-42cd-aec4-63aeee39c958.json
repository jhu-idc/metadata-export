United States<br />\nSenate.<br />\nThe INF treaty had its origin in<br />\nthe proposal of the zero-zero option that Reagan made to the<br />\nSoviet Union in 1981. The offer<br />\nto eliminate both superpowers'<br />\nnuclear arsenals in Europe was<br />\nrejected, argued David, because<br />\nthe Soviets had no compelling<br />\nreason to seek arms reductions.<br />\nAt that time, the U.S. had no<br />\nintermediate range nuclear<br />\nsystem in place in Europe.<br />\n\"Why should the Russians get<br />\nrid of existing systems in exchange for an American promise<br />\nnot to deploy systems we might<br />\nnot be able to deploy anyway?\"<br />\nasked David. He argued that the<br />\ntreaty would never have been<br />\nsigned had the U.S. not first<br />\ndeployed medium-range nuclear<br />\nmissiles in Europe and thereby<br />\nstrengthened the U.S.'s bargaining position with the Soviet<br />\nUnion.<br />\n\"It's only when we built our<br />\nweapons up in Europe that both<br />\nsides agreed to come down [in the<br />\nnumber of missiles],\" he claimed. David praised the Reagan administration for pushing through<br />\ndeployment of the Pershing<br />\nsystem in Europe despite the turmoil the issue caused in the countries that comprise the North<br />\nAtlantic Treaty Organization.<br />\n\"If we had listened to the doveish end of the spectrum in the early 1980s,\" continued David,\"we<br />\nwould have agreed to a nuclear<br />\nfreeze, in which case we would<br />\nhave hundreds of Soviet nuclear<br />\nweapons in Europe and no<br />\ncounterparts in the West, or we<br />\nwould have agreed to a<br />\nmoratorium, in which case the<br />\n<br />\nSoviets would presumably still retain their monopoly of weapons.<br />\n\"It's interesting that when the<br />\nSoviets walked out [of the arms<br />\nreduction negotiations], they said<br />\nthey would not return until<br />\nAmerica got rid of its nuclear<br />\nweapons in Europe,\" he continued.\" America did not get rid<br />\nof its nuclear weapons in Europe,<br />\n[and] the Soviets returned<br />\nanyway. I can't imagine any<br />\nAmerican administration going<br />\nback with its tail between its legs<br />\nand saying, 'Never mind.\"<br />\nDavid lauded the precedents<br />\nthis treaty sets, among them the<br />\nconcept of bargaining from a<br />\nposition of strength. Measures in<br />\nthe treaty provide for previously<br />\nunheard of verification procedures, including on-site, ondemand inspection of suspected<br />\nmissile sites both in the Soviet<br />\nUnion and in the U.S.<br />\nFor the first time, \"an equal<br />\noutcome by unequal cuts\" in the<br />\nsuperpowers' aresenals is<br />\nguaranteed, as the Soviet Union<br />\nis required to eliminate three<br />\ntimes as many warheads as the<br />\nU.S., he said.<br />\n\"I feel that we should approve<br />\nthe treaty,. . . because it's a good<br />\ntreaty,\" said David. The United<br />\nStates, though, might not be able<br />\nto back out of ratifying the treaty.<br />\n\"For one reason, we proposed it,\" remarked David. \"If we<br />\nsay no to the treaty, it looks like<br />\nwe're saying to the Russians, we<br />\ndon't take yes for an answer. Furthermore, if we back out now,<br />\nI'm convinced the Europeans<br />\nwould not allow us to complete<br />\nour deployment of nuclear<br />\nweapons and probably force out<br />\nthe weapons that are there.\"<br />\nOne of the major shortcomings<br />\nof the INF treaty is that it does<br />\nnot address the disparity betwen<br />\nthe conventional forces of the<br />\nWarsaw Pact and NATO. \"In a<br />\nconventiona1 war, the Soviets and<br />\nWarsaw Pact forces would win,<br />\nwould win easily, and would win<br />\nquickly,\" noted David, as he<br />\nenumerated what critics from the<br />\nright have said about the INF<br />\ntreaty.<br />\nDavid doubted that the United<br />\nStates would risk a retaliatory<br />\nstrike against American soil by<br />\n<br />\nusing nuclear weapons in<br />\nresponse to a Soviet invasion of<br />\nEurope. \"No one, including<br />\nmyself, believes that we would<br />\nuse strategic weapons first to defend Europe,\" he said.<br />\nFrance and Britain, believes<br />\nDavid, are also not likely to<br />\nemploy nuclear weapons in the<br />\nevent of Soviet agression, not<br />\neven in a second strike.<br />\nCalling this stance a \"better red<br />\nthan dead mentality,\" David added, \"They know that as soon as<br />\nthey push that button, they can<br />\nkiss their societies good bye.<br />\nFrance, in World War II, in<br />\nessence said, 'We'd rather<br />\ncapitulate than have the destruction of our society.\"<br />\n\"The Europeans will feel<br />\nthat. . .[they] will have to fend<br />\nfor themselves, that the U.S. is<br />\nabandoning them, isolating<br />\nthem,\" he continued.<br />\nAccording to David, some<br />\ncritics argue that such a situation<br />\nwill cause the European nations<br />\nto adopt a much more neutralist<br />\npolitical stance that will no longer<br />\nbe pro-U.S. \"Our concern is that<br />\nif the Europeans will feel this way<br />\nthat the way they'll fend for<br />\nthemselves is to appease the<br />\nSoviet Union, the so-called<br />\n'Finlandization' of Europe,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"And the final problem with<br />\nthis treaty, especially argued<br />\nfrom the right,\" continued<br />\nDavid, \"is that it will lull the<br />\nUnited States into a false sense of<br />\nsecurity. . .[D]emocracies simply can't sign arms control treaties<br />\nwith totalitarian states.\" David<br />\ncited the Anglo-German Naval<br />\ntreaty between Britain and Nazi<br />\nGermany as a case in point.<br />\nAccording to David, though,<br />\nthe Soviet Union has given indications that it is willing to<br />\nreduce the number of troops and<br />\namount of material amassed on<br />\nthe border between the Warsaw<br />\nPact and NATO. David called the<br />\ncurrent state of arms control<br />\nnegotiations a case of \"wait and<br />\nsee what happens next.\"<br />\nHe concluded, \"I think it's important for us to be hopeful, to<br />\ngive peace a chance, as we used<br />\nto say in my day, but I think we<br />\nhave to do it with our eyes open.\"<br />\n<br />\nDon'tcompete<br />\nwith a<br />\nKaplan student<br />\nbe one.<br />\nWhy?

The two most salient and, admittedly, most<br />\ncounterintuitive of these conclusions amount to a demise<br />\nof \"learning\" (if this expression is taken in the standard<br />\nsense) and to the demise of all criteria of \"utility\" and<br />\n\"usability\" in the design of natural languages. In the course<br />\nof this talk, I will attempt to justify these claims and, also.<br />\ntry to do justice to the claim that cognitive science is, at bottom, a brandh of biology characterized by an appropriately abstract level of explanation.

The report made a stinging indictment of the Homewood<br />\natmosphere in recommending<br />\nwide-ranging changes in<br />\nHomewood's academic, administrative, and social structure.<br />\nThe report claimed that the<br />\nrelationships between the administration, faculty, staff and<br />\nstudents is at \"the heart of the<br />\nproblems of the human climate,\"<br />\nand noted an \"artificial separation of the community\" that<br />\n\"creates a hierarchy that is elitist<br />\nand exclusive and causes certain<br />\nmembers to feel like second-class<br />\ncitizens.\"<br />\nThe Task Force, composed of<br />\ndozens of administration<br />\nmembers, faculty members and<br />\nstudents, came into being in October, 1986 under a directive<br />\nfrom University President Steven<br />\nMuller to determine the means by<br />\nwhich problems at Homewood<br />\nmay be addressed.<br />\nRecommending the creation of<br />\nan \"office of ombudsperson at a<br />\nhigh administrative level,\" the<br />\nTask Force called for examinations of Homewood governments, personnel policies, and the<br />\nstatus of racial and ethnic<br />\nminorities, especially blacks.<br />\nThe Task Force also recommended a reevaluation of<br />\nundergraduate education and urged the University to find funding<br />\nto develop adequate student<br />\nspace, \"including improvement<br />\nand expansion of the Student<br />\nUnion and Athletic Center<br />\nfacilities and additional University housing.\"<br />\nAlso included in the report<br />\nwere statements criticizing the<br />\npreoccupation of students and<br />\nfaculty with career advancement<br />\nand selfish drives for success.<br />\nThe Task Force also recommended an investigation into the<br />\npossibility of reinstating an honor<br />\ncode.<br />\nSince publication, many<br />\nstudents and administrators have<br />\ninvoked the name of the report in<br />\nproposing activities or changes to<br />\nimprove the quality of life here.<br />\nThe creation of Hoppy Hour has<br />\nproven to be a success, but little<br />\nelse has happened this year to indicate that the report has impacted<br />\nmuch upon decision making, particularly at the administrative<br />\nlevel.<br />\nWe would like to see more<br />\ndone. Minor steps were made to<br />\nchange the tenure policy for professors, and a student group appears on the way to making<br />\nrecommendations on the feasibility of instituting an honor code.<br />\nThe major problem with the<br />\nreport is that implementation of<br />\nmany of the major recommendations would require money, and<br />\nthat money, particularly in light<br />\n<br />\nof the Arts and Sciences' deficit,<br />\ndoes not appear to be coming.<br />\nThe Human Climate Report,<br />\ntherefore, stands as a base for<br />\nfuture progress.

The stories we presented offered<br />\nundetermined potential for progress: MindBrain, the Ethics Crisis, and the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force Report. And while<br />\npotential is a subjective determination<br />\nwhich feeds the imagination, as the year<br />\ndraws near, the excitement has not been<br />\nreplenished with results.<br />\nWhy results could not be achieved remains mysterious, at all levels of the<br />\nUniversity. It is obviously not sufficient to<br />\npawn off stonewalling on a hostile administration or an ambivalent Student<br />\nCouncil. Rather, if anyone or thing is to<br />\nblame, it might be problematic inertia.<br />\nThere is something about this school that<br />\nmakes it hard to accomplish anything of any<br />\nreal significance.<br />\nIt is not for us to complain, though, that<br />\ngood ideas have not come to their fruition<br />\nin our tenure. To do so would be to suggest ideas might be stifled until the object<br />\nhas been achieved, which is fallacious and<br />\ndangerous reasoning. It is only with the<br />\ncommunication of ideas\u2014and problems\u2014<br />\nthat progress can be made.<br />\nStudents this year were full of projects<br />\nand ideas for and about Hopkins. In fact,<br />\nthere seemed to be a concentration of activity focused not on South Africa or other<br />\npolitical issues, but rather on the direction<br />\nin which Homewood is moving. Two issues<br />\nin particular\u2014the resignation of Dean of<br />\nHomewood Schools Administration Robert<br />\nWelch and the budget deficit in the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences\u2014were of particular<br />\n<br />\nconcern to students, encouraging them to<br />\ntake a role in setting the course for the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nGetting emotionally involved again has<br />\nits costs. It is hard to listen to President<br />\nMuller insist that the Arts and Sciences<br />\ndeficit would have no effect on our education, and then find out about a plan to shrink<br />\nthe size of the faculty and delay<br />\nconstruction.<br />\nMore frustrating even than that,<br />\nhowever, is that it is hard to be indignant.<br />\nHow do we really know,for example, what<br />\nthe effects of a ten percent decrease in<br />\nfaculty over the next five years will be?<br />\nSure, rationally it means more students to<br />\nfewer faculty, but what does that necessarily mean for an individual student?<br />\nIt would be nice to end the year as<br />\npositively as we started it, with hope and<br />\nexpectation, but all too many of this year's<br />\nexpectations led only to disappointment.<br />\nMaybe, come next fall, some of these confusing issues will be a little clearer.<br />\nWe would like to wish luck to everyone<br />\nleaving Hopkins this spring\u2014especially<br />\nthose who tried to make a difference around<br />\nhere (students and administrators included.)<br />\nMany of those who arrived here a few years<br />\nago with fresh ideas and an abundance of<br />\nenergy might leave feeling a little frustrated<br />\nwith this school; you finally begin to<br />\nunderstand what Hopkins is all about, and<br />\nthen it's time to leave. Just remember that<br />\nyou've perhaps broken the ground with<br />\nyour efforts, and that's no small accomplishment at a place like this.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nA. Lee Davis<br />\nHere I am, receiving requests<br />\nfor donations of a thousand<br />\ndollars from my high school.<br />\nsmall pleas for whatever I can<br />\ngive from the Hopkins alumni<br />\noffice\u2014you would think I was on<br />\nthe eve of becoming a functioning member of society. Hold on,<br />\nI must have gotten on the wrong<br />\ntrain.<br />\nLast week I pulled off the alltime coup of my Hopkins career.<br />\nWhen the flyers which advertised caps and gowns first appeared<br />\nin our Gilman boxes, I spotted the<br />\nname that has hounded me since<br />\nmy pre-frosh days: Barnes & Noble. There on the spot I decided<br />\nI would attend graduation in a suit<br />\nand tie, jams and Wayfarers.<br />\nBVD's and chest hair\u2014anything but in a cap and gown<br />\nrented from B&N.<br />\nA few weeks passed and I missed the deadline for reserving the<br />\nvestments, which was fine with<br />\nme. Lisa, however, was getting<br />\nnervous. When she inquired, she<br />\nwas told it was too late to order<br />\ncaps and gowns. When she asked a B&N representative the<br />\nname of the company that was<br />\nrenting them to B&N so she could<br />\ncontact them herself, she was<br />\ntold, \"You may order them<br />\nthrough Barnes & Noble only.\u2014<br />\nUpon hearing the woeful tale,<br />\nI decided to do a little investigating. In no time at all I had<br />\ncontacted a company downtOwn<br />\nthat would rent me two caps and<br />\ngowns for ten dollars a day.<br />\nWhen I told the salesgirl that I<br />\nneeded them On May 26, she urged me to come in for a fitting<br />\nASAP because they were doing<br />\ncollege graduations during that<br />\n<br />\ntunc. It didn't take nary two firings of the old neurons to sense<br />\nthat something was going on.<br />\nMy victory was made sweeter<br />\nby the fact that B&N charged $15<br />\nper day. With the late fee, it<br />\nwould be twenty. Young entrepreneurs prick up your ears!<br />\nAlthough I don't know the exact<br />\nsize of our graduating class, with<br />\nall the undergraduate degrees and<br />\ngraduate degrees being awarded<br />\ncome the last week of May. I'd<br />\nsurmise that there will be about<br />\n900 cap/gown combinations<br />\nfloating around campus. At fifteen dollars a head. that's a gross<br />\nof almost fourteen grand.<br />\nSuppose B&N got a bulk rental rate from the uniforms company, say $5 an outfit. That<br />\nleaves nine thousand. Subtract<br />\nminimal operating costs, and<br />\nB&N picks up a pretty healthy<br />\npenny for a day's work. Congratulations to those procrastinators and fellow protestors<br />\nwho also found other options. To<br />\nyou others, lines form on the left<br />\nfor bluing and tattooing.<br />\nAhem. It's a tough subject to<br />\nbroach, but we all know that this<br />\nis the end. Last year. I drove up<br />\nto Ithaca to sec my brother<br />\ngraduate from Cornell. Watching<br />\nthose champagne bottles spit like<br />\nthe froth on a sea of red caps, I<br />\nwas suddenly all choked up. I let<br />\nthe feeling overcome me, hoping<br />\nthat a little vicarious trickle then<br />\nwould prevent a flood when I<br />\nunderwent the same ceremony a<br />\nyear later.<br />\nAs expected. there have been<br />\ngood -times and had times at<br />\nHopkins, in Baltimore. I shan't<br />\nsubject you to an enumeration of<br />\nSee LEE, 11<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\n<br />\nNoam Neusner<br />\n<br />\nObservina Jewish Holidays<br />\nIn April, Jews observe three<br />\nholidays of seemingly disparate<br />\nmeaning. The first, Passover,<br />\ncelebrates the redemption from<br />\nslavery in Egypt. The second,<br />\nYom Hashoa, is a day of mourning for the Jews who perished in<br />\nthe Holocaust. The third is<br />\nIsrael's Independence Day.<br />\nExcept for Chanukah and the<br />\nHigh Holidays, these three are<br />\ncelebrated by more Jews than any<br />\nother holidays, including the<br />\nweekly Sabbath.<br />\nOn Passover Jewish students,<br />\nfor the most part, celebrated the<br />\nSeder with their families or at<br />\nschool with their friends. On<br />\nYom Hashoa Jewish students at<br />\nHopkins organized a touching and<br />\nthoughtful service mourning the<br />\nloss of 6 million Jews, and on<br />\nIsraeli Independence Day these<br />\nstudents, besides having sponsored a symposium on Israeli<br />\nscience a few weeks earlier,<br />\ncelebrated the cultural and<br />\npolitical significance of Israel.<br />\nIt says a great deal about Jews.<br />\n(and Jewish students, for that<br />\nmatter) that their most observed<br />\nholidays are ones that speak of a<br />\nparticular philosophy, for<br />\nPassover, Yom Hashoa, and<br />\nIsrael Independence Day corn-<br />\n<br />\nmemorate historical and religious<br />\nredemption from slavery.<br />\nOn Passover we celebrate our<br />\nfreedom from the slavery in<br />\nEgypt. It says in the Passover<br />\nHagadah, \"We were slaves of<br />\nPharoah in Egypt and the Lord<br />\nour God brought us forth from<br />\nthere with a mighty hand and an<br />\noutstretched arm. And if the Holy One had not brought our<br />\nfathers forth from Egypt, then we<br />\nand our descendants would still<br />\nbe slaves to pharoaoh in Egypt.\"<br />\nAnd so it is that we celebrate<br />\nPassover in freedom, not in<br />\nslavery. Each year Jews of different levels of observance tell the<br />\nsame story, some in a more abbreviated form than others, but<br />\nnonetheless with the same purpose: to thank God for this act by<br />\nrepeating it to every successive<br />\ngeneration.<br />\nYom Hashoa was placed<br />\nstrategically (by the Israelis, one<br />\nwould assume) one week before<br />\nIsraeli Independence Day precisely because the Shoah is perceived as the slavery before the<br />\nredemption, the creation of a<br />\nJewish state.<br />\nIt is not so much an historical<br />\noutlook as much as a spiritual<br />\none. Israel was not created<br />\n<br />\nbecause of the Shoah (although<br />\nthere was obviously more support<br />\nfor a Jewish state after the<br />\nHolocaust), but instead, Israel is<br />\nseen as the redemption from the<br />\nmodern version of slavery in<br />\nEgypt, the Nazi plan to destroy<br />\nthe Jewish people.<br />\nIt is particularly thoughtprovoking that Jewish students<br />\nshould identify with these<br />\nholidays so closely. That Jewish<br />\nstudents should consistently<br />\ncelebrate the crises and triumphs<br />\nof the Jewish nation but not the<br />\nrites and rituals of the Jewish<br />\nreligion makes one thing clear:<br />\nJewish students, on the whole,<br />\ncelebrate their Jewishness as a<br />\npeople, not as a religion.<br />\nIt is also easier to raise the interests of Jewish students by appealing to their concerns as a<br />\npolitical entity.<br />\nWitness the most recent focal<br />\npoints for Jewish students' concerns: one, the current rioting in<br />\nIsrael which has all but ended<br />\nIsrael's once peaceful relationship<br />\nwith her Arab citizens, and two,<br />\nthe impossible situation for Jews<br />\nin Russia.<br />\n<br />\nSee HOLIDAY, 11<br />\n<br />\nEditors<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nJulie Levine, Flory Ware<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

For example,<br />\nwhen posed with the potentially<br />\nexplosive issue of ordaining<br />\nfemale rabbis, Jewish students<br />\nobserve an uncharacteristic<br />\nsilence. The same is true for their<br />\nnon-reaction to attacks on Reform<br />\nJudaism from ultra-Orthodox<br />\nJews. Should we interpret this<br />\n<br />\nsilence as indifference to<br />\nJudaism?<br />\nThe answer to that question is<br />\nno. Jewish students are concerned with the political battles which<br />\ndiscuss Jewish freedom and survival because they act out the<br />\nstory of redemption and slavery<br />\nrepeated in the Passover service<br />\nand in the observance of Yom<br />\nHashoah and Israeli Independence Day.<br />\nWe were slaves in Egypt, yet<br />\n<br />\nwe do not want to be slaves in<br />\nIsrael to a potentially dangerous<br />\nPalestinian state.<br />\nJewish students are not concerned with infra-religious struggles because the freedom of Jews<br />\neverywhere is not yet a fact.<br />\nJudaism as a religion has not<br />\nlost any significance; it did not<br />\nhave as much as we might have<br />\nwanted to believe. Judaism as a<br />\nreligion fails to raise the interest<br />\nof Jewish students because the<br />\n<br />\nThe Revenge of Changing Majors<br />\nby Eric Ruck<br />\nRemember what I wrote about<br />\nchanging majors the week before<br />\nlast? Well, apparently a number<br />\nof people do, for I got a number<br />\nof different responses. I've had<br />\nfriends tell me \"Great editorial,<br />\nand you know, you're right,\"<br />\nand, \"Nice editorial, but.<br />\nI also got letters from Whiting<br />\nSchool Associate Dean Alan Karr<br />\nand Electrical and Computer<br />\nEngineering Chair Charles<br />\nWestgate. Aside from determining that Dean Karr has nicer stationary, it has occurred to me that<br />\nit may be wise to elaborate on my<br />\npast scrawlings.<br />\nTrue, I was and still am unsatisfied with the advising and<br />\ntreatment of undergraduates as a<br />\nwhole. My former advisor may<br />\nhave been a \"relative newcomer<br />\nto campus,\" but it took me all of<br />\nmaybe two weeks to figure out<br />\nwhere just about every department with which I would ever<br />\nwant to associate is located.<br />\nOf course I cannot characterize<br />\nall professors this way, but at<br />\nleast for me the department is doing about as well as the Orioles.<br />\nIt may very well be that I talked<br />\nto all the wrong people, but such<br />\nis life.<br />\nI realize that to have a topnotch engineering program we<br />\nmust attract protessors on the cutting edge of research; however,<br />\nthe people of the psychology<br />\ndepartment are actively involved<br />\nin research, yet they still have<br />\ntime to sponsor freshmen in-<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\n<br />\nI I<br />\n<br />\nNHAPPAYA ME4N, I<br />\n\"L/'Re Suglacvs?\"<br />\n<br />\nYo /v6 Got- Yore?<br />\noff' MD GNAW AND<br />\nEVERV94INGI.<br />\n<br />\nz mem',<br />\n<br />\ndependent projects.<br />\nI do not believe that the other<br />\nprestigious schools are any better.<br />\nI really wouldn't expect the professors at MIT to have lunch and<br />\ndiscuss grades with their<br />\nundergraduates.

This lack of consideration is not the way by which<br />\nI wish to be educated.<br />\nThe primary reason why I do<br />\nnot choose to continue in the<br />\nengineering program, however,<br />\nis because I have lost interest in<br />\nthe field. Sure, I continually score<br />\nabove-average grades, but they<br />\nare lower than they should be<br />\nbecause I have developed such an<br />\napathy to the work.

Our opposition to this work is consistent with our<br />\nlongstanding testimony of nonviolence. George Fox stated it<br />\nclearly: \"We utterly deny all outward wars and strife and<br />\nfighting with outward weapons, for any end or under any pretense whatsoever\" (1661).<br />\nIn addition to our spiritual perspective, there is a need to<br />\nconsider this in relation to the mission of the University.<br />\nIntended as an institution of education and healing, Hopkins<br />\nis now a major military contractor, top among universities.<br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) engages in research on<br />\nsome of the most ethically controversial weapons systems<br />\ncurrently under development. The APL's work on missile guidance<br />\nsystems is critical to the development of the Pentagon's Cruise<br />\nand Trident II programs. By accepting work on these nuclear<br />\nweapons systems, as well as the Strategic Defense Initiative,<br />\nthe University is contributing to the dangers of a nuclear<br />\nholocaust.<br />\nWe believe the University has a respopslbility to provide an<br />\nethical framework for students, and to fulfill this, must consider the moral implications of its own endeavors. No institution<br />\ncan hope to foster social responsibility in students unless it<br />\nis itself socially responsible. It is inappropriate for The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University to be associated with a military laboratory. We urge you to cease the APL's work for the Pentagon,<br />\nor to sever ties 4ifetween the APL and the University.<br />\nMay we have the opportunity to discuss this matter with you?<br />\nSi)acerely,<br />\n<br />\n\u201e<br />\nAnne C.W.

Someone should have told Ruck that<br />\nthere is an Office of Advising and<br />\nCounseling to answer questions<br />\nof this nature. Furthermore,<br />\nsimply because Ruck feels that<br />\none professor is ignorant does not<br />\ngive him the right to condemn the<br />\nentire department. Would it be<br />\nfair to say that because one<br />\nfreshman makes sweeping<br />\ngeneralizations that all freshmen<br />\nare so closed-minded as to do the<br />\nsame? Certainly not.<br />\nIf Ruck doesn't know of any<br />\nengineering professors with \"half<br />\nthe devotion\" for the engineering<br />\nstudents as Robert Arellano had<br />\nfor the writing seminars students,<br />\nlet me enlighten him.

Professors Cammarata of Materials Science,<br />\nJones of Civil Engineering,<br />\nNaiman of Mathematical<br />\nSciences, and Revelle of<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering also care about their<br />\nstudents. In fact, I can only think<br />\nof two professors that fit Ruck's<br />\nunflattering description. I'm not<br />\nsaying that all engineering faculty are attentive to the needs of<br />\nstudents, but the situation is no<br />\nworse than in any other department at this school.<br />\nRuck is certainly entitled to his<br />\nopinions, however, one would<br />\n<br />\nLETTERS, from 11<br />\nmade no departures from its antilibertarian stance on Mr. Corbett's freedom of expression.<br />\nThe re-emergence of free<br />\nspeech issues elicits concern that<br />\nin general the problem may be infrastructural and that the situation<br />\nwarrants more concerted attention from the administration.

Not having seen TV in<br />\nmonths I was pretty pleased with<br />\nthe idea of kicking back and watchin' some vids on this great new<br />\nhunk of technology. Well,<br />\nwouldn't you know that those<br />\ndinks at MTV would pick this<br />\nweekend to run some bogus ninehour countdown of \"the top 100<br />\nvideos of all time.\" Needless to<br />\nsay, most of the yids they picked<br />\nblew great big slimy chunks. So,<br />\nI picked up the ol' remote and<br />\nstarted flipping around the channels. I ended up watching Nighttracks on TBS, and what to my<br />\nwondering eyes should appear but<br />\nthe video for Midnight Oil's<br />\n\"Beds are Burning.\" Truly. this<br />\nis the mark of success.<br />\nIt's about time. The Oils have<br />\nbeen the hottest thing since sliced bread in the native Aussie<br />\nhomeland since \"10. 9, 8, 7, 6,<br />\n5, 4, 3, 2, 1\" was released in<br />\n1983, but it took until now for<br />\nAmericans to get used to the idea<br />\nof some largish dude screaming<br />\nout political convictions backed<br />\nby one of the grooviest bands<br />\naround.<br />\nA lot of that probably had to do<br />\nwith the Oil's rather outspoken<br />\npolitical views, views which they<br />\nhad no qualms about incorporating into the lyrics. \"10, 9, 8...\"<br />\ncould almost come across as the<br />\nliberal manifesto against the<br />\nmilitary-industrial complex and<br />\nthe fat-cats of capitalism. I've II<br />\nproblems with politics in my<br />\nmusic, but some folks seem<br />\nunable to get into the groove<br />\nwhen they think they're being lectured to. Of course, American audiences in general are used to<br />\nmusic that's so politically lame,<br />\neven Ronald Reagan can get away<br />\nwith quoting popular lyrics, and<br />\nnobody gets too upset. When we<br />\ndo want politics, we want it backed with pretty four-part har-<br />\n<br />\nmonies and folk guitars. That's a<br />\nfar cry from the dance-club/<br />\nstudio sound of \"10, 9, 8...\u2014<br />\nYeah, there are some tamborines<br />\nand acoustic guitars in here, but<br />\nit's none of this 12-string fingerpicking stuff.

There are some really<br />\nnice vocals too, like on \"Power<br />\nand the Passion,\" where Peter<br />\nGarret's vocals soar all over the<br />\nscales. He's not showing off or<br />\ntrying to sound pretty, he's a man<br />\nwith a cause, and he's letting you<br />\nhear the passion in his soul.<br />\nWith Red Sails in the Sunset,<br />\nGarret and co. backed off a little<br />\nfrom their world-reaching vision<br />\nand decided to concentrate on<br />\nsome issues particular to their<br />\nhomeland with songs like \"Sherman's Boxers,\" \"Kosciousko,\"<br />\nand \"Shipyards of New Zealand.\" The problem was that nonAustralian listeners didn't know<br />\nwhat the hell they were talking<br />\nabout half the time, and if they<br />\ndidn't know, they didn't care. It<br />\nwas kind of a trade-off, 'cause the<br />\nmusic was showing a tendency to<br />\nmove away from the studio<br />\ntowards a more guitar-rock kind<br />\nof thing. Tracks like \"When the<br />\nGenerals Talk\" and \"Bakerman\"<br />\nstill showed signs of a love-affair<br />\nwith Fairlights and samplers, but<br />\nthe guitars of Jim Moginie and<br />\nMartin Rotsey were being given<br />\na much larger role in things.<br />\nWhich brings us to their latest<br />\nalbum, Diesels and Dust. Open<br />\nup the gatefold sleeve, see the<br />\nAborigine kids, and you've got<br />\nno excuse for not figuring out<br />\nwhat this album's about\u2014<br />\noppression and ecology. If you<br />\nwant to be specific, Aboriginal<br />\noppression and Australian<br />\necology, but there really ain't no<br />\nreason to be specific. Just kick<br />\n<br />\nback and listen to the grooves,<br />\nand rest easy in the knowledge<br />\nthat if you want to be picky about<br />\nthe lyrics, you can relate to them.<br />\nSure, \"Beds are Burning\" is<br />\nabout giving Ayers Rock and<br />\nother land back to the Aborigines<br />\n(I think), but not knowing that<br />\ndoesn't keep you from saying,<br />\n\"Hey, it's a song about man impinging on nature.\" The Oils<br />\nhave finally learned the graceful<br />\nart of writing the double-sided<br />\nlyric, the kind of thing you can<br />\nknow the specifics of (if you're<br />\nreally hip), or if you don't know,<br />\nyou can figure out.<br />\nThey've also 1earned what a<br />\nmean groove the rhythm section<br />\nof Peter Gifford and Rob Hurst<br />\ncan lay down when they aren't<br />\nfighting their way around a flood<br />\nof synth. There's a lot less synth<br />\non this album and a lot more<br />\nguitar. The guitars actually carry<br />\nmost of the melody, with the<br />\nsynths just adding some nice ambient washes here and there, with<br />\nthe occasional straight-forward<br />\npart. This new-found respect for<br />\nguitars can be chalked up to new<br />\nproducer Warne Livesay, who<br />\napparently doesn't share Nick<br />\nLauney's love for the Fairlight.<br />\nIt's those mean guitars that are<br />\ngonna make this a big album,<br />\nbecause that's what American audiences want.

It<br />\nseems they'd found Marcy<br />\nslumped over his desk that morning, killed by three bullets fired<br />\nfrom his own gun. The only<br />\nprints on the gun were those of<br />\nMarcy and his wife. They were<br />\nholding her now for questioning.<br />\nBill took me to the room where<br />\nshe was and let me have a few<br />\nminutes with her.<br />\n\"Oh, Mac, thank God you're<br />\nhere,\" she said, practically launching herself at me as she started<br />\nto cry.<br />\n\"There, there,\" I said. Tears<br />\nstreamed from her eyes. I found<br />\nmyself more and more attracted<br />\nto her; but I had a rule never to<br />\nget involved with clients.(Well,<br />\nit was more of a guideline than a<br />\nrule.) I restrained myself and continued,\"Now calm down and tell<br />\nme what happened.\"<br />\n\"Last night when Phil came<br />\nhome, I confronted him. I showed him the pictures and told him<br />\nI wanted a divorce. He went into<br />\na rage. He left the house and said<br />\nhe was going to sleep at his office.<br />\nI called him there, and he was a<br />\nlittle better, but we were still mad<br />\nat each other.

Although their encounter<br />\nis short, it leaves indelible print<br />\non Fiorentino who continues to<br />\nsend Fermina telegraphs, until<br />\nshe denies him for the upright Dr.<br />\nJuvenal Urbino at the request of<br />\nher father. Fermina and Dr. Urbino live quietly without much interference from Florentino, who<br />\nhas resigned himself to waiting<br />\nfor Fermina to be free. His opportunity will ultimately come at<br />\nthe death of Urbino in chapter<br />\none, when the old doctor falls<br />\nfrom a mango tree while trying<br />\nto reach his precious, Latinspeaking parrot.

Garcia Marquez has written a novel<br />\nof life, where the growth of<br />\ncharacters is emphasized, and has<br />\nenclosed it in the shell of a novel<br />\nof fate, where opposing forces<br />\nmust come to a head at the<br />\nnovel's close. It is the fatalistic<br />\npremise that kicks off the story<br />\n(that gray-haired Fermina must<br />\neither accept or reject Fiorentino)<br />\nthat carries the reader effortlessly through the rest of the story.<br />\nAnd at the narrative's wrap-up,<br />\nafter letting us in on the intimate<br />\ndetails of each of the relationships, Garcia Marquez has the<br />\nreader championing Fiorentino,<br />\nwishing against reason that Fermina, stron. and determined like<br />\n<br />\nmost of the women of the story,<br />\nwill accept her fate and live out<br />\nher days with Fiorentino on the<br />\nriver.<br />\nThematically, Love in the Time<br />\nofCholera is seamless. The story<br />\nquestions if innocent desire is<br />\npossible in the adult world. The<br />\npitting of pure love versus cool<br />\nreality establishes the subtextual<br />\ntension. In his speech to the<br />\nNobel Prize Committee in 1982,<br />\nGarcia Marquez explained that it<br />\nis the writer's obligation to create<br />\nUtopia. His story must sing the<br />\nprais of love against any odds,<br />\nof love in the time of lost hope,<br />\nof love in the time of anger, even<br />\nof love in the time of cholera.<br />\nGarcia Marquez, who has written<br />\nmysteries and melodramas,<br />\nelevating each style to new artistic<br />\nheights, brings the love story to<br />\napical proportions with his uncanny, distanced narrator's voice; it<br />\nis the voice of an infant Grandfather, held by the trappings of<br />\ninnocence in a naive youth, but<br />\ntaken by nature into old age. The<br />\n<br />\ntone, like the theme, expresses<br />\nthe exclusivity of realism and<br />\nidealism. All of which is resolved in a magnificent and stunning<br />\nconclusion.<br />\nThe story contains the requisite<br />\nscenes of shock: gossip, sex, and<br />\nviolence. But Garcia Marquez,<br />\nwho has never shied from traditional reader interests, manages<br />\nto encorporate the crowd-pleasers<br />\ninto the fabric of the narrative so<br />\nflawlessly, they are immaculately believable; hence, the real<br />\nmagic of the story. Love in the<br />\nTime of Cholera, already a bestseller around the world, is destined to become another classic,<br />\nkeeping pace with (some would<br />\nsay even surpassing) One Hundred Years ofSolitude.

Dermatologists are concerned with<br />\ngrowing evidence which shows<br />\nthat tanning contributes vitamin<br />\ndeficiencies and night blindness.<br />\nMore important, however, is the<br />\nsharp increase in cases of<br />\nreported skin cancer. The<br />\nAmerican Academy of Dermatology predicts that half a<br />\nmillion Americans will develop<br />\nskin cancer this year. The lifetime risk of melanoma, the most<br />\ndangerous type of skin cancer, is<br />\nup 900 percent since 1930.<br />\nMalignant melanoma affects<br />\nnearly 25,000 people annually<br />\nand of this number each year,<br />\nabout 5500 die. As a whole,<br />\nAmericans are aware of the<br />\ndangers of tanning and try to<br />\nshield themselves with the<br />\nvarious sunscreens on the market.<br />\nBut sunscreens offer only limited<br />\nprotection.<br />\nSo why do people gamble with<br />\ntheir health while the media is<br />\nteeming with sun warnings? All<br />\nAmerica loves a tan. Many<br />\nbelieve that this love affair with<br />\nsunshine is purely psychological.<br />\nPeople like the look and feel of<br />\na tan. But only recently has the<br />\ntan truly come into vogue. Before<br />\nthe fifties, a tan was the sign of<br />\na worker, like a field hand, who<br />\ncould not afford to be sheltered<br />\nfrom the sun. But fads come and<br />\n<br />\ngo. today, a tan is a sign of<br />\nleisure, carefree youth, spring<br />\nbreak in Fort Lauderdale, or tennis at the club. The result of tans<br />\nbecoming such a status symbol,<br />\nhowever, is that people do not<br />\nwant to listen to what doctors<br />\nhave to say about the dangers of<br />\nsuntanning.<br />\nThe Tanning Process<br />\nDuring the tanning process, exposure to sunlight triggers special<br />\nskin cells to release melanin, a<br />\nprotective pigment, onto the surface. Melanin causes the skin to<br />\nthicken and absorb only a fraction<br />\nof the ultraviolet(UV)rays from<br />\nsunlight. This thickened skin tries<br />\nto scatter the remainder of the UV<br />\nrays and prevent them from<br />\npenetrating to deeper layers of<br />\nHence, the upper melanincovered layers become \"tanned\"<br />\nwhen they absorb the UV rays.<br />\nUnfortunately, all of these rays<br />\ncannot be absorbed or scattered<br />\nduring long periods of exposure.<br />\nWhat people interpret as a healthy<br />\nresponse to the sun is actually the<br />\nbody trying to shield itself.<br />\nThe Damage<br />\nUV rays come in two varieties<br />\nof wavelengths: alpha (a) which<br />\nare longer waves and beta (b)<br />\nwhich are shorter. Beta waves are<br />\nmore effective for tanning but are<br />\nmore dangerous. These waves are<br />\nconcentrated around midday.<br />\nAlthough UV-A rays are not as<br />\ndangerous as UV-B rays, neither<br />\nof them are considered safe.<br />\n<br />\nHarry Targovnik, a radiotherapist<br />\nat Mount Sinai Medical Center in<br />\nNew York, found that high doses<br />\nof UV-A rays can inhibit the enzyme necessary for the DNA<br />\nrepair which follows the damage<br />\ncaused by UV-B rays.<br />\nResearch shows that UV radiation can cause imbalances in the<br />\nmolecular structure of DNA,<br />\nwhich leads to cancer. Other<br />\nsuspected health hazards include:<br />\nthe suppression of the immune<br />\nsystem, promotion of cataracts,<br />\nand toxic reactions in people taking antibiotics. The most<br />\ndevastating of these health<br />\nhazards, however, is skin cancer.<br />\nSkin cancer is the uncontrolled<br />\ngrowth of cell layers. All three<br />\ntypes of skin cancer (basal<br />\nsquamous and melanoma)can be<br />\ncured if treated in time. Malignant melanoma is the least common of the three; however, it is<br />\nby far the most dangerous. Basal<br />\nand squamous cell cancer are the<br />\nresult of cumulative sun exposure<br />\nwhile melanoma is triggered by<br />\nblistering sunburns from<br />\nchildhood and adolescence. Dr.<br />\nSidney Hurwitz, clinical professor of pediatrics and dermatology at the Yale School of<br />\nMedicine, says that children that<br />\nget sunburned double their<br />\nchances for developing malignant<br />\nmelanoma in later life.<br />\nProtection<br />\nSo, what can sun worshippers<br />\ndo for protection'? Use sunscreen.<br />\nEven a seemingly safe overcast<br />\nday will let in up to 80 percent of<br />\n<br />\nthe UV rays. Being underwater<br />\nhas the same effect. And despite<br />\nour thinking that the dangerous<br />\nsun is only at the beach. UV rays<br />\n,do not stop at arms hanging out<br />\nof car windows or legs walking<br />\naround parks. For these reasons,<br />\nusing a sunscreen is important for<br />\nany stay in the sun.<br />\nDermatologists recognize six<br />\ncategories of pigment from very<br />\nfair to deeply colored. From these<br />\ncategories, dermatologists have<br />\nassigned varying strengths of<br />\nsunscreens, ranging form 2 for<br />\nminimal protection to 32 for maximum protection. The Skin<br />\nCancer Fondation, however,<br />\nrecommends using a sunscreen<br />\nwith no less a protection rating<br />\nthan 15. Sunscreens are rated according to their \"sun protection<br />\nfactor\" or SPF. SPF multiplies<br />\nthe amount of time that a bather<br />\ncan stay in the sun by a factor of<br />\nthe product. For example, using<br />\na sunscreen with an SPF of 2<br />\nallows the user to stay in the sun<br />\ntwice as long as they could<br />\nwithout protection before burning. Most of these products convariation of<br />\ntain some<br />\nparaminobenzoic acid (PABA)<br />\nwhich is found in all living cells<br />\nand absorbs some of the UV rays.<br />\nPABA is usually combined with<br />\nUV-A screens like benzophenomes or anthranilates for<br />\nadded protection.<br />\nThe problem is that sunscreens<br />\ncan only offer a limited amount<br />\nof protection. Excessive use of<br />\nsunscreens inhibit the body's production of vitamin D. The precursor to vitamin D is 7-dehydro-<br />\n<br />\ncholesterol, a steroid which is excreted onto the skin's surface.<br />\nThrough a photochemical reaction with UV-B radiation, the previtamin D is spontaneously converted into vitamin D and is absorbed back into the skin. According to scientists at the University of Illinois, sunscreens interfere<br />\nwith the vitamin's production by<br />\nabsorbing the radiation necessary<br />\nfor its synthesis.<br />\nTo avoid the dangers of<br />\nultraviolet radiation, tan worshippers try tan accelerators and tanning pills. Tan accelerators, when<br />\napplied several days prior to tanning, contain the chemical<br />\nprecursor to melanin so that the<br />\nskin tans faster, decreasing the<br />\namount of time in the sun. Tanning pills, however, have little to<br />\ndo with the body's natural tanning mechanism. In fact, they contain coloring pigments which do<br />\nnothing for the skin except turn<br />\nit orange. But tanning pills have<br />\nan unexpected side effect. European studies reveal that consumers who have taken the pills<br />\nfor an extended amount of time<br />\nfind it hard to adapt their vision<br />\nat twilight and at night. This<br />\nblindness is a result of crystalline<br />\nstructures of the main coloring<br />\npigment, canthaxanthin, building<br />\nup on the retina.<br />\nDermatologists agree that the<br />\nbest protection in the sun is the<br />\nshade. Simply stay out of the sun.<br />\nIf one must go in, wear a hat and<br />\nlong sleeves.<br />\n<br />\nTaking off all that unwanted winter flab<br />\nby Brook Wiers<br />\nSo you've got a little soft<br />\ntissue, some flab around the<br />\nmidriff, or maybe it has gone a<br />\nlittle beyond that.

Well, cheer up\u2014you've<br />\ngot a lot of worth as a human being, and beauty is only skin deep.<br />\nThe above is true, but if you'd<br />\nlike to do something about those<br />\nextra pounds, read on.<br />\nWhy people are overweight<br />\nBefore you can do something<br />\nabout a problem, it helps to know<br />\na little about it. Perhaps it would<br />\nhelp to review a couple of<br />\ntheories on how people become<br />\nand remain overweight:<br />\nFat cells\u2014Adipose tissue cells<br />\nare the cells in your body which<br />\nstore fat. As an adolescent, one<br />\ngains weight by increasing the<br />\nnumber of fat cells (hyperplasia),<br />\nwhich all stay in one uniform<br />\nsize, more or less.<br />\nAs an adult fewer new fat cells<br />\nare formed, but each already existing one increases in size<br />\n(hypertrophy) as weight is<br />\ngained.<br />\nThere is some indication that<br />\ndieters can lose weight until all<br />\ntheir fat cells have shrunk to normal size, and then they will lose<br />\n<br />\nno more. Since a fat cell once<br />\ngained is never lost, this is bad<br />\nnews for people who became<br />\noverweight as adolescents.<br />\nLiposuction, which would permanently remove fat cells, is an<br />\nalternative treatment.<br />\nOvereating\u2014Studies have<br />\nshown that overeating is encouraged when foods have high<br />\nfat content and are available in a<br />\nwide variety. Sweetness of food<br />\nalso contributes. Sounds like the<br />\ntypical American diet, doesn't it?<br />\nWhen you see a person in the<br />\ncafeteria eating three peas and a<br />\nglass of water for dinner, pay<br />\nattention\u2014he or she may be on to<br />\nsomething; the low fat content<br />\nand variety will make the food<br />\nseem unappealing, and he or she<br />\nwill eat less.<br />\nWhat can be done to combat<br />\nobesity.<br />\nThe central idea is that your<br />\nbody has an energy balance between intake and output. The<br />\ndieter's goal is to make energy<br />\noutput exceed energy input, forcing the body to make up the difference by burning away its<br />\nenergy reserves, which are fat.<br />\nFirst, let's address energy output. The big factor over which<br />\nyou have some voluntary control<br />\nis exercise. The most obvious<br />\nbenefit of exercise is energy<br />\n<br />\nexercise couldn't hurt. But what<br />\nsort of exercise program is right<br />\nfor you?<br />\nIn terms of type of exercise,<br />\nprobably aerobic would be best.<br />\nAerobic exercise is steady exercise wich elevates your heartrate<br />\nto \"at least 70% of the maximum.\" Some common exercises<br />\nmight be jogging, stationary cycling, aerobic dance, rowing, and<br />\nswimming.<br />\nIn addition to burning up<br />\ncalories, aerobic exercise tends to<br />\nimprove components of fitness<br />\nsuch as flexibility and muscular<br />\nand cardiovascular endurance.<br />\nThat's aerobic exercise's advantage over something more<br />\nanaerobic like weight lifting,<br />\nwhich burns calories but doesn't<br />\nhave these salutary effects.<br />\nOf course, working out with<br />\nweights to tone up muscles after<br />\nsome aerobic exercise would be<br />\nfine. If you're like most people,<br />\nthough, you may just not have the<br />\nenergy to do all that in one shot,<br />\nand, if you tried to do it all, you<br />\nmight become discouraged with<br />\nyour program and eventually<br />\nquit.<br />\nWhich brings us to the second<br />\nimportant part of designing an exercise program\u2014adherence.

Exercise also has several<br />\nmore subtle effects for the dieter.<br />\n1) Exercise will increase your<br />\nbasal metabolism\u2014normally<br />\ndieting's restriction of caloric intakes causes your body to reduce<br />\nits rate of metabolic energy output by 15 to 30%, and you're<br />\nback where you started. Exercise<br />\ncounteracts this drop.<br />\n2) Normally when you diet,<br />\n25% of the pounds you lose are<br />\nactually lost lean tissue (muscle).<br />\nExercise will alter the ratio of loss<br />\nof fat to muscle so that 95% of<br />\nall weight lost will be fat.<br />\n3) Exercise suppresses<br />\nappetite\u2014a nifty little side effect.<br />\n4) Lastly, but still importantly,<br />\nexercise can counter some of the<br />\nill effects of obesity such as<br />\nelevated plasma insulin levels<br />\n(related to diabetes) and elevated<br />\nplasma lipid levels (linked to<br />\nhealthy.<br />\nheart disease).<br />\nIn addition to all these positive<br />\neffects, exercise will also counter<br />\nnegative<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nsome<br />\npsychological effects of being<br />\noverweight, such as low selfesteem\u2014you've gone out and<br />\ndone something good for your<br />\nbody, and you can feel proud of<br />\nthat.<br />\n<br />\nyourself for not doing it\u2014instead,<br />\ndesign a program that you will<br />\nstick to.<br />\nBe especially sure to keep in<br />\nmind that you are an individual<br />\nand that this program is designed<br />\njust for you; don't be bothered by<br />\nthe fact that others can do more,<br />\nor do it more quickly. That's fine<br />\nfor them, but your program is for<br />\nyou.<br />\nExercise physiologists and<br />\nbehaviorists have come up with<br />\nsome helpful tips that can help<br />\nyou to stay with your program:<br />\n1) Start at low intensity and<br />\nmake changes gradually. This is<br />\nan exercise program which could<br />\nlast your whole life, so there's no<br />\nneed to push things.<br />\n2) Set goals and be sure to<br />\nreward yourself when you<br />\nachieve them. In fact, try to encourage yourself every step of the<br />\nway. This process of positive<br />\nreinforcement is important in<br />\nestablishing a positive mental attitude toward exercising. In setting goals, note that time-based<br />\ngoals are mentally easier to take<br />\nthan distance-based goals.<br />\n3) Get some social support for<br />\nyour exercise by exercising with<br />\nothers.

The increased usage poses many questions: Do steroids actually<br />\nenhance performance? What are<br />\nand<br />\nphysiological<br />\nthe<br />\npsychological effects, if any? Is<br />\nthis fair?<br />\nTo most athletes the answers to<br />\nthese questions are related. If<br />\nsteroids enhance athletic ability,<br />\nthen the athlete may be willing to<br />\nrisk negative effects in exchange<br />\nfor the increased ability.<br />\nMany athletes use steroids as a<br />\nsupplement to their training,<br />\nmuch like vitamins or diet. Some<br />\nconsider steroid use \"replacement therapy\"; during physical<br />\nand emotional stress, the body's<br />\nhormone level decreases. Steroids replace these lost hormones.<br />\nThis would be similar to drinking<br />\nGatorade after intense exercise to<br />\nreplace minerals lost in sweat.<br />\nIn this light, many athletes view<br />\nsteroid use as fair. At the same<br />\ntime, however, in an effort to<br />\nmaintain a fair level of competition, the governing bodies of both<br />\namateur and professonal sports<br />\nhave expanded drug testing to include steroids.<br />\nAlthough ethical considerations<br />\nremain unresolved, the strict<br />\nscientific evidence is somewhat<br />\nclearer. Most physicians agree<br />\n<br />\nBye-bye flab<br />\nFLAB, from 22<br />\nflowers\"\u2014focus on the pleasant<br />\naspects of exercise (your environment) and not on the more<br />\nunpleasant aspects such as bodily sensations. Make exercising<br />\nenjoyable; it may be slower that<br />\nway, but it's worth it if it'll keep<br />\nyou at it.<br />\nFood<br />\nNow to the diet itself, which,<br />\nas should be clear to you by now,<br />\nis only one part of a good weight<br />\nloss plan. To be perfectly honest,<br />\nI don't have any specific ideas<br />\nhere. In general, attempt to eat a<br />\nbalanced diet that stays away<br />\nfrom high fat content and/or<br />\nsweet foods (remember the<br />\n\"overeating\" diet).<br />\nEven though variety lends to<br />\novereating, it's probably a good<br />\nidea with the right foods (fish,<br />\npoultry, salads) in order to maintain interest in eating these<br />\n\"good\" foods.<br />\nTo keep the \"energy input\" to<br />\nyour body down, watch the<br />\ncalories in your diet. Consulting<br />\na nutrition book should help you<br />\nlearn approximately how many<br />\ncalories different foods have.<br />\nAfter doing this, though, don't<br />\ndraw up one of those precise<br />\nevery-calorie-every-meal-everyday-of-the-week diets; they're too<br />\ncomplicated. A better, more<br />\npractical idea might be to formulate a mental list of \"good\"<br />\nfoods to eat and choose menu<br />\nitems at each meal from this list.<br />\nFor those not satisfied with this<br />\ngeneral advice, one last bit of<br />\nmiracle dieting hope: the VLCD,<br />\na diet developed in France in the<br />\nlate 1960's, has been proven to be<br />\ndramatically effective and is considered safe. Weight losses have<br />\n-raged 45 pounds in only 12<br />\n<br />\nweeks.<br />\n\"VLCD\" stands for \"verylow-calorie-diet.\" Participants<br />\neat \"400 to 700 calories per day<br />\nconsisting of 55 to 75 grams of<br />\nprotein along with vitamin and<br />\nmineral supplements\".<br />\nEssentially a protein, vitamins,<br />\nand minerals-supplemented fast,<br />\nthis diet is similar to that consumed by some anorexics.

Hormones regulate<br />\nthe body's complex system of interrelated functions.<br />\nFor example, epinephrine<br />\n(adrenalin) increases blood ,<br />\npressure and pulse rate, contracts<br />\nmost involuntary muscles, and<br />\nmakes chemical energy available<br />\nto the body for the conversion of<br />\nmanual work. Therefore, an extreme increase in hormone levels<br />\ncan cause effects beyond the<br />\ndesired ones.<br />\nFor many years, short-term effects of steroids have been<br />\nobserved. They include changes<br />\nin the concentration of lipids in<br />\nthe bloodstream. Lipids ale<br />\norganic molecules made up of fat<br />\nand sugar that cannot be dissolved in water. Such compounds,<br />\nwhen linked to protein, are called lipoproteins.<br />\nResearchers now believe that<br />\nthe sixty percent decrease in High<br />\nDensity Lipoproteins (HDL)<br />\nobserved after only four weeks of<br />\nsteroid use may result in increased risk of heart attack.<br />\nLow Density Lipoproteins<br />\n(LDL) supply cholesterol to the<br />\norgans through the bloodstream,<br />\nwhile HDL's displace the extra<br />\ncholesterol. When the amount of<br />\nHDL is decreased, the cholesterol<br />\nbuilds up in the blood vessels,<br />\nnarrowing them and decreasing<br />\nthe blood supply to the heart.<br />\nFurthermore, the synthetic hormone tricks the body into believing that its natural testosterone<br />\nlevels are above normal. As a<br />\nresult, not enough natural<br />\ntestosterone is produced, causing<br />\ndecreased sperm production,<br />\nshrinkage of the testicles, and<br />\nimpotence.<br />\nAdditionally, due to the in-<br />\n<br />\ncreased body size, a person's<br />\nframe cannot support the increased body mass, causing frequent<br />\nand more severe injuries and<br />\nlonger rehabilitation after injuries. In women, steroid use is \u2022<br />\nassociated with a deepening of the<br />\nvoice and increased facial hair.<br />\nLong-term physiological effects are just now being studied<br />\nbecause steroid use has only<br />\nrecently become widespread.<br />\nScientists hypothesize that steroid<br />\nuse may result in cardiovascular<br />\nproblems and tumor formation.<br />\nEven more frightening than the<br />\nphysiological changes caused by<br />\nsteroid use are the psychological<br />\nchanges.<br />\nOne of the effects of testerone<br />\nis aggressive behavior. Aggression may actually be beneficial to<br />\nsports competitors, but in everyday life, agression and the other<br />\npsychological changes can be<br />\nharmful.<br />\nA recent study of 41 steroidusing body builders performed by<br />\nHarrison G. Pope and David I.<br />\nKatz, indicated a variety of<br />\npsychotic symptoms found in the<br />\ngroup. Twelve percent reported<br />\n\"overtly psychotic symptoms,\"<br />\nand another ten percent were<br />\ndescribed as subthreshold<br />\npsychotic.<br />\nDuring the period of steroid<br />\nuse, a full one-third showed major mood swings and twelve percent had \"manic episodes.\" This<br />\nwas evidenced dramatically by<br />\nthe case of a body builder who<br />\ndrove an old car into a tree at forty miles per hour while his friend<br />\nvideotaped the entire affair.<br />\nThe most striking information<br />\nin the study is that not one of the<br />\nsubjects experienced such<br />\nbehavior before steroid use. Furthermore, they were shocked by<br />\ntheir actions.

Hopkins has<br />\nnow won seven games in a row<br />\nand seems well on its way to<br />\nanother appearance in the Final<br />\nFour, to be held this year in<br />\nSyracuse on the Memorial Day<br />\nweekend.<br />\nOver 10,000 Homecoming Day<br />\nfans filled a chilled Geblein<br />\nStadium to see the Jays take a 7-1<br />\nlead and never lose control of the<br />\ngame. Five different Hopkins<br />\nplayers scored before Maryland<br />\ncould register its first goal 6:16<br />\ninto the second quarter. In fact,<br />\nseven different Jays scored before<br />\na single Jay player could connect<br />\nfor a second time\u2014Senior attackman Mike Morrill scored<br />\nthree times and now has 19 goals<br />\non the season.<br />\nThe win proved that the Jays<br />\nhave not lost the momentum they<br />\ngathered in games following their<br />\n19-7 opening game loss to<br />\nSyracuse. Since then the Jays<br />\nhave beaten all their major<br />\nrivals\u2014Virginia, North Carolina,<br />\nand Maryland\u2014and are ranked<br />\nsecond in the Division I coaches'<br />\npoll. Barring an upset Hopkins<br />\nwill end the regular season as the<br />\nnumber two team in the nation.<br />\nThe victory over Maryland on<br />\nSaturday may have knocked the<br />\nTerrapins from the playoff hunt<br />\nin which Hopkins is doing so<br />\nwell. The Terps won their first<br />\nfour games but have since recorded just as many losses.<br />\nAt Homewood Maryland's fortunes sank low enough to be<br />\noutplayed by Hopkins in every<br />\nfacet of the game. The Jays not<br />\nonly outscored the Terrapins but<br />\nalso outshot them 38-26, and the<br />\n<br />\nJays picked up more ground balls<br />\nthan Maryland, 56-35. Hopkins'<br />\nstandout sophomore goaltender<br />\nQuint Kessenich made twelve<br />\nsaves to Terp goalie Dennis<br />\nSullivan's eight.<br />\nThe Jays also outshone the<br />\nTerps in ways that don't show up<br />\non the scoresheets. Several times<br />\nthe Jays batted Maryland passes<br />\nout of the air. Other times<br />\nMaryland would botch long<br />\ncross-field passes, and the Jays<br />\nwould complete them and head<br />\ntowards the net.<br />\nEven in the physical game the<br />\nBlue Jays outdid the Terrapins. In<br />\none play a Maryland midfielder<br />\nset himself to clobber Hopkins<br />\nmidfielder Brendan Kelly. But<br />\nKelly hopped out of the way at the<br />\nlast moment, sending the charging Terrapin sprawling on the<br />\nturf. The Jays, on the other hand,<br />\nfinished their checks.<br />\nLate in the second quarter a<br />\nlong pass was flung in the direction of Maryland midfielder Doug<br />\nPoindexter. Lurking near<br />\nPoindexter was Hokins junior<br />\ndefenseman Dave Pietramala.<br />\nThe hit applied by Pietramala was<br />\nprobably the most complete in<br />\ncollege lacrosse this season;<br />\nPoindexter lay motionless on the<br />\nturf and was forced to leave the<br />\ngame with a separated shoulder.<br />\nThe Blue Jays then scored two<br />\nmore goals to end the half with<br />\na 7-1 lead.<br />\nBut Petro's role was not just to<br />\ndeliver monster checks. He spent<br />\nthe entire afternoon menacing<br />\nMaryland attaclunen and bringing<br />\nthe ball upfield for the Hopkins<br />\noffense. He is arguably the best<br />\ndefender in the country.<br />\nPietramala was joined as usual<br />\non defense by junior Jim DeTommaso and junior Greg Lilly, who<br />\nreturned to the line-up following<br />\na knee injury. Both played the<br />\n<br />\ntype of defense that has limited<br />\nBlue Jay opponents to fewer than<br />\nten goals in six of eight games.<br />\nFreshman Matt Panetta got<br />\nthings going for the Jays with his<br />\nseventh goal of the year at 5:24<br />\ninto the first quarter. Sophomore<br />\nattackman Scott Marr followed<br />\nless than five minutes later with<br />\nhis ninth goal of the season. Marr<br />\nis now second on the Jays in total<br />\npoints (combined goals and<br />\nassists) with 22, and leads<br />\nHopkins in assists with his 13.<br />\nThe Jays ended all first period<br />\nscoring with an extra-man goal by<br />\nBrendan Kelly. It was Kelly's<br />\nninth goal of the season to accompany his 7 assists.<br />\nIn the second quarter junior<br />\nmidfielder Joe Rzempoluch<br />\nstarted things up with a goal just<br />\n22 seconds into the period. The<br />\nJays' face-off specialist now has<br />\nfour goals this season. Less than<br />\n2 minutes later Morrill scored his<br />\nfirst goal of the afternoon followed by Pietramala's check and then<br />\ntwo goals by unsung heroes for<br />\nthe Jays.<br />\nSenior co-captain Jack<br />\nCrawford scored his fourth goal<br />\nof the season on an assist from<br />\nMarr. The midfielder has rebounded nicely this year from a<br />\nknee injury that kept him sidelined all of 1987. Then, freshman<br />\nlong-stick middie Bill Dwan<br />\nscored his first goal of the season,<br />\nassisted by sophomore Jay<br />\nClarke. Following the graduation<br />\nof the 1989 season superstars.<br />\nDwan is sure to become an anchor of the Jays defense.<br />\nThe Terrapins jumped out<br />\nquickly in the third quarter scoring three early goals, tiut with<br />\n7:18 remaining, a pushing penalty on midfielder Toni Bedard<br />\nresulted in Morrill's second goal<br />\nof the game. He was assisted by<br />\nMarr. This combo combined for<br />\nanother extra-man score 1:10<br />\nlater, and the win was never again<br />\nin doubt.<br />\nThe fourth quarter was started<br />\nby Joe Rzempoluch in the same<br />\nvein as his second quarter effort.<br />\nRezy netted his second goal of the<br />\nyear 33 seconds into play.<br />\nMaryland then scored three<br />\ngoals, but sophomore long-stick<br />\nmiddie Dave Howland recorded<br />\nhis third goal of the season and<br />\nended the game's scoring.<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays will play seventhranked Navy at Annapolis tomorrow.

It happened two weeks<br />\nago in College Park when Navy<br />\nfaced the highly touted Terps of<br />\nMaryland. Just 26 seconds into<br />\nthe first overtime, Mike Herger<br />\ntook a pass from Brian Keith and<br />\nsailed it past Maryland goalie<br />\nDennis Sullivan. The goal not only sealed an 8-7 upset for the<br />\nMidshipmen, but it made Navy a<br />\nserious contender in the race for<br />\nthe NCAA Lacrosse National<br />\nTitle.<br />\nThe secret to victory was ball<br />\ncontrol, and the Midshipmen executed it to perfection. Herger<br />\nand the rest of the the Middie attack did an excellent job of keeping the ball away from the explosive Terrapin offense. When<br />\nthe Terps did mount an offensive<br />\nsurge, senior goalie Joe Donnelly was there to stop them, as he<br />\nmade 12 saves and held Maryland<br />\nto only 7 goals on 42 shots. Thus,<br />\nHerger's third goal of the afternoon was enough to give Navy<br />\nit's third consecutive victory and<br />\na place among the college<br />\nlacrosse elite.<br />\nLast week, Navy proved that<br />\ntheir victory over Maryland was<br />\nno fluke, as they handed Virginia<br />\ntheir second straight defeat by a<br />\nscore of 7-5. Plagued by penalties<br />\nin the first half. Navy fell behind<br />\n5-2 despite some brilliant play<br />\nfrom Donnelly and the defensive<br />\ncrew of Nick Amaturio, Jim Darcy, and Tony Iuculano. The<br />\ndefense continued to sparkle in<br />\nthe second half, as Donnelly<br />\nmade 5 of his 13 saves in the third<br />\nquarter, until the offense finally<br />\nbegan to click. Once again using<br />\na ball-control offense. Navy<br />\nquickly rebounded to take a 7-5<br />\nlead in the fourth quarter. Two<br />\ngoals each by Paul Basile, Brian<br />\nKeith, and Herger were enough<br />\nto improve Navy's record to 7-3.<br />\nThe biggest story for the<br />\nMishipmen this season has been<br />\n<br />\nRichard Bell<br />\n<br />\nFreshman dynamo Matt Panetta blasted a shot past Terp netminder Dennis Sullivan to give the Jays an early lead.<br />\n<br />\nthe play of Joe Donnelly. Even<br />\nwhen his team was struggling to<br />\na 3-3 start, Donnelly was coming<br />\nup with big games. In the 9-4 loss<br />\nto Rutgers on March 12, Joe<br />\nmade 14 saves in the first half<br />\nalone. Against Yale, Navy fell<br />\n10-7 despite Donnelly's 17 saves.<br />\nJoe's leadership and outstanding<br />\nplay in the last two weeks is a big<br />\nreason that Navy has pulled off<br />\ntwo consecutive upsets, and it is<br />\na big reason the Midshipmen are<br />\noptimistic going into this Saturday's game against Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nNavy's offense is similar to the<br />\nBlue Jay's in that both teams<br />\nprefer a slow, ball-control game.<br />\nSophomore Mike Herger has<br />\nemerged as the Middies most<br />\ndangerous scoring threat, scoring<br />\n3 goals against Maryland and 2<br />\ngoals last week against Virginia.<br />\nJunior Paul Basile has also played<br />\nwell in the clutch for Coach Mat-<br />\n<br />\nthews, tallying twice last week<br />\nagainst the Cavaliers. Rounding<br />\nout Navy's attack unit is<br />\nSophomore Brian Keith, who<br />\nseems most effective when teamed up with Herger.<br />\nThis Saturday's game against<br />\nHopkins will match two teams<br />\nwith very similar philosophies.<br />\nBoth teams like a controlled offense and seem to avoid the fastbreak. Also, both the Jays and the<br />\nMiddies rely heavily on their<br />\ngoaltenders and solid defensive<br />\nunits. But that doesn't mean that<br />\nthe crowd in Annapolis this<br />\nSaturday will be bored, because<br />\nHopkins and Navy always seem<br />\nto play extremely close games.<br />\n<br />\nLast season great goaltending by<br />\nDonnelly kept Navy in the game<br />\nhere at Homewood, but a late rally by the Midshipmen fell just<br />\nshort as the Jays won 10-9. The<br />\nseries between the two teams is<br />\nalso very close, with Hopkins<br />\nholding a slight 33-25-1 edge.<br />\nNo matter what happens this<br />\nSaturday, Navy has certainly proven themselves to the NCAA<br />\nTournament Selection Committee.

The<br />\nLady Jays continued their streak<br />\nlast Wednesday against Gettysburg with four record-breaking<br />\nperformances. Krista Johnson<br />\nand Mary Gifford ran 26.2 and<br />\n26.3 in the 200 meter dash,<br />\nknocking a whole second off of<br />\nGifford's old record of 27.25,<br />\nwhile Valerie Wilson and Laura<br />\nPerlinn ran 17.1 and 17.2 in the<br />\n100 meter hurdles to slip under<br />\nthe 1984 record of 17.3.<br />\nOverall, Hopkins placed second at the Swarthmore tri-meet<br />\nwith 35 points behind Messiah<br />\n(89 points) and ahead of Swarthmore (24 points). All three<br />\nteams knew that Messiah, the<br />\n1987 MAC Champions, would<br />\nrun away with most of the points,<br />\nso the main battle was between<br />\nHopkins and Swarthmore for second place. The Lady Jays appeared to be at a big disadvantage<br />\nbecause Swarthmore had beaten<br />\nthem the last five years in a row.<br />\nHopkins was also missing their<br />\ntwo best middle-distance runners,<br />\nSuzi McGinn and Diana Logan,<br />\ndue to injuries, and they agian<br />\nhad no women competing in the<br />\nhigh jump, shot put, discus or<br />\njavelin. Despite these shortcomings, Hopkins took first in three<br />\nevents through the efforts of<br />\nMary Gifford in the 100, Johnson<br />\nin the 200, and Perlinn in the 400<br />\nhurdles, who were supported by<br />\nnumerous second, third and<br />\nfourth place points from the 400<br />\nrelay team, Wilson and Perlinn in<br />\nthe 100 hurdles, April Savoye in<br />\nthe 400, Molly Bardsley in the<br />\n1500 and 3000, Johnson in the<br />\n100, and Gifford in the 200 and<br />\n<br />\nlong jump.<br />\nIn the 84-50 loss to Gettysburg<br />\nCollege on Wednesday, April 27,<br />\nHopkins did much better than the<br />\nscore shows, especially considering the fact that Gettysburg beat<br />\nthem last year 100-31. This year,<br />\nthe Lady Jays were ahead 42-40<br />\nin the running events but with no<br />\nHopkins entries in the high jump<br />\nor the field events. Gettysburg<br />\npicked up 36 free points and won<br />\nthe meet easily. The women earned first place points from the 4 X<br />\n100(Perlinn, Logan, Savoye, and<br />\nJohnson), Gifford in the 100,<br />\nJohnson in the 200, Perlinn in the<br />\n400 meter hurdles, McGinn in the<br />\n800, and Bardsley in the 3000,<br />\nwho ran a personal best of 11:07.<br />\nThe women travel to Pennsylvania tomorrow to compete in<br />\nthe Millersville Metric Invitational, a meet renowned for producing fast times 'due to the fully<br />\nautomatic timing and swift track.<br />\nOne week later they're off to<br />\nWestern Maryland for the grand<br />\nfinale, the MAC Championship<br />\nmeet.

Also leaving are<br />\njunior Mary Gifford and<br />\nsophomore Krista Johnson, who<br />\nare both transfering. These seven<br />\npeople together accounted for a<br />\nlarge percentage of points earned at meets this year.

The Human<br />\nClimate Task Force recognized<br />\nthis issue, yet so little seems to be<br />\npromoted. Student Council as<br />\nwell as the GRO would be doing<br />\na service to the Hopkins community if they worked together.<br />\nReligion\u2014It's time that the administration realize the importance and the influence of the<br />\nvarious religious communities at<br />\nHopkins. Once this is done,<br />\n<br />\nmaybe some real support and encouragement can be provided for<br />\nthe different communities.<br />\nAs for the leaders of the<br />\nvarious religious communities\u2014<br />\nit's time you started working<br />\ntogether. Speaking from personal<br />\nexperience, some of you can't see<br />\nbeyond your own concerns. I<br />\nstrongly encourage you to start<br />\ndoing so. First, think about the<br />\npurpose of religion, then consider<br />\nyour responsibilities to Hopkins.<br />\nSomething that I haven't heard<br />\nanything about and haven't asked about is a student chapel. For<br />\nan administration which claims to<br />\nbe concerned about student life,<br />\nthey sure ignore a significant part<br />\nof many people's lives. Hopkins<br />\nis a university. This should mean<br />\nthat it is open to all ideas. A nondenominational student chapel<br />\nwould only mean acknowledging<br />\nthat religion and faith do play an<br />\nimportant part in many people's<br />\nlives. The University would only be showing its maturity in supporting a chapel, instead of its<br />\nfear in dealing with anything<br />\nreligiously connected. The ditch<br />\nbehind the Glass Pay would be a<br />\nnice place\u2014something tells me<br />\nalumni would find the money to<br />\nsupport this effort. I hope the<br />\nUniversity is sincere in its efforts<br />\nto improve student life and student relationships. I hope religion<br />\nis an area the University will<br />\nacknowledge.<br />\nChaplain's Office\u2014For those<br />\nof you who don't know, there's<br />\na Religious Life Committee on<br />\ncampus under the auspices of the<br />\nChaplain. This committee needs<br />\nto set some goals, decide whether<br />\nthey are going to work together<br />\nand then actually do something.<br />\nInterfaith retreats, discussion<br />\ngroups, dinners. . . There also<br />\nneeds to be an outreach to<br />\nstudents. The Chaplain has many<br />\na responsibility. The only comment I would make here is that<br />\nthere should be more concern<br />\nwith the campus\u2014i.e. campus<br />\ngroups, campus issues, etc. I<br />\ndon't think that diatribes in stu-<br />\n<br />\ndent publications help the<br />\nHopkins community. If the goal<br />\nis to raise awareness, there are<br />\nother, more decent ways to<br />\nachieve this. One of the things I<br />\nhave mentioned consistently during the past few weeks is that the<br />\nDean of Student's office is accessible. Susan Boswell is accessible. Try these people before<br />\nthrowing a public tirade, which<br />\nwill only cause the other side to<br />\nbecome defensive.<br />\nSpring Fair\u2014Congrats to the<br />\nchair people.

Coach<br />\nAnderson then prevailed upon<br />\nmidfielder<br />\nKristin<br />\nCole<br />\n(Boothwyn, PA)to take a shot at<br />\nthe goalie position. Anderson's<br />\nchoice turned out to be an excellent one, and Cole's play has<br />\nbeen a welcome surprise that has<br />\nmade the difference in several<br />\ngames.<br />\nDefense has been the key to<br />\nHopkins' victories, according to<br />\nCoach Anderson. Leaders on the<br />\nclose defense are Julie Seigrist<br />\n(Pasadena, MA), Erica Feller<br />\n(Washington, DC), and Liz Davis<br />\n(Newport, RI).

United States<br />\nSenate.<br />\nThe INF treaty had its origin in<br />\nthe proposal of the zero-zero option that Reagan made to the<br />\nSoviet Union in 1981. The offer<br />\nto eliminate both superpowers'<br />\nnuclear arsenals in Europe was<br />\nrejected, argued David, because<br />\nthe Soviets had no compelling<br />\nreason to seek arms reductions.<br />\nAt that time, the U.S. had no<br />\nintermediate range nuclear<br />\nsystem in place in Europe.<br />\n\"Why should the Russians get<br />\nrid of existing systems in exchange for an American promise<br />\nnot to deploy systems we might<br />\nnot be able to deploy anyway?\"<br />\nasked David. He argued that the<br />\ntreaty would never have been<br />\nsigned had the U.S. not first<br />\ndeployed medium-range nuclear<br />\nmissiles in Europe and thereby<br />\nstrengthened the U.S.'s bargaining position with the Soviet<br />\nUnion.<br />\n\"It's only when we built our<br />\nweapons up in Europe that both<br />\nsides agreed to come down [in the<br />\nnumber of missiles],\" he claimed. David praised the Reagan administration for pushing through<br />\ndeployment of the Pershing<br />\nsystem in Europe despite the turmoil the issue caused in the countries that comprise the North<br />\nAtlantic Treaty Organization.<br />\n\"If we had listened to the doveish end of the spectrum in the early 1980s,\" continued David,\"we<br />\nwould have agreed to a nuclear<br />\nfreeze, in which case we would<br />\nhave hundreds of Soviet nuclear<br />\nweapons in Europe and no<br />\ncounterparts in the West, or we<br />\nwould have agreed to a<br />\nmoratorium, in which case the<br /><br />\nSoviets would presumably still retain their monopoly of weapons.<br />\n\"It's interesting that when the<br />\nSoviets walked out [of the arms<br />\nreduction negotiations], they said<br />\nthey would not return until<br />\nAmerica got rid of its nuclear<br />\nweapons in Europe,\" he continued.\" America did not get rid<br />\nof its nuclear weapons in Europe,<br />\n[and] the Soviets returned<br />\nanyway. I can't imagine any<br />\nAmerican administration going<br />\nback with its tail between its legs<br />\nand saying, 'Never mind.\"<br />\nDavid lauded the precedents<br />\nthis treaty sets, among them the<br />\nconcept of bargaining from a<br />\nposition of strength. Measures in<br />\nthe treaty provide for previously<br />\nunheard of verification procedures, including on-site, ondemand inspection of suspected<br />\nmissile sites both in the Soviet<br />\nUnion and in the U.S.<br />\nFor the first time, \"an equal<br />\noutcome by unequal cuts\" in the<br />\nsuperpowers' aresenals is<br />\nguaranteed, as the Soviet Union<br />\nis required to eliminate three<br />\ntimes as many warheads as the<br />\nU.S., he said.<br />\n\"I feel that we should approve<br />\nthe treaty,. . . because it's a good<br />\ntreaty,\" said David. The United<br />\nStates, though, might not be able<br />\nto back out of ratifying the treaty.<br />\n\"For one reason, we proposed it,\" remarked David. \"If we<br />\nsay no to the treaty, it looks like<br />\nwe're saying to the Russians, we<br />\ndon't take yes for an answer. Furthermore, if we back out now,<br />\nI'm convinced the Europeans<br />\nwould not allow us to complete<br />\nour deployment of nuclear<br />\nweapons and probably force out<br />\nthe weapons that are there.\"<br />\nOne of the major shortcomings<br />\nof the INF treaty is that it does<br />\nnot address the disparity betwen<br />\nthe conventional forces of the<br />\nWarsaw Pact and NATO. \"In a<br />\nconventiona1 war, the Soviets and<br />\nWarsaw Pact forces would win,<br />\nwould win easily, and would win<br />\nquickly,\" noted David, as he<br />\nenumerated what critics from the<br />\nright have said about the INF<br />\ntreaty.<br />\nDavid doubted that the United<br />\nStates would risk a retaliatory<br />\nstrike against American soil by<br /><br />\nusing nuclear weapons in<br />\nresponse to a Soviet invasion of<br />\nEurope. \"No one, including<br />\nmyself, believes that we would<br />\nuse strategic weapons first to defend Europe,\" he said.<br />\nFrance and Britain, believes<br />\nDavid, are also not likely to<br />\nemploy nuclear weapons in the<br />\nevent of Soviet agression, not<br />\neven in a second strike.<br />\nCalling this stance a \"better red<br />\nthan dead mentality,\" David added, \"They know that as soon as<br />\nthey push that button, they can<br />\nkiss their societies good bye.<br />\nFrance, in World War II, in<br />\nessence said, 'We'd rather<br />\ncapitulate than have the destruction of our society.\"<br />\n\"The Europeans will feel<br />\nthat. . .[they] will have to fend<br />\nfor themselves, that the U.S. is<br />\nabandoning them, isolating<br />\nthem,\" he continued.<br />\nAccording to David, some<br />\ncritics argue that such a situation<br />\nwill cause the European nations<br />\nto adopt a much more neutralist<br />\npolitical stance that will no longer<br />\nbe pro-U.S. \"Our concern is that<br />\nif the Europeans will feel this way<br />\nthat the way they'll fend for<br />\nthemselves is to appease the<br />\nSoviet Union, the so-called<br />\n'Finlandization' of Europe,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"And the final problem with<br />\nthis treaty, especially argued<br />\nfrom the right,\" continued<br />\nDavid, \"is that it will lull the<br />\nUnited States into a false sense of<br />\nsecurity. . .[D]emocracies simply can't sign arms control treaties<br />\nwith totalitarian states.\" David<br />\ncited the Anglo-German Naval<br />\ntreaty between Britain and Nazi<br />\nGermany as a case in point.<br />\nAccording to David, though,<br />\nthe Soviet Union has given indications that it is willing to<br />\nreduce the number of troops and<br />\namount of material amassed on<br />\nthe border between the Warsaw<br />\nPact and NATO. David called the<br />\ncurrent state of arms control<br />\nnegotiations a case of \"wait and<br />\nsee what happens next.\"<br />\nHe concluded, \"I think it's important for us to be hopeful, to<br />\ngive peace a chance, as we used<br />\nto say in my day, but I think we<br />\nhave to do it with our eyes open.\"<br /><br />\nDon'tcompete<br />\nwith a<br />\nKaplan student<br />\nbe one.<br />\nWhy?

On the eve of<br />\nthe vote, students held a<br />\ncandlelight vigil supporting the<br />\noriginal faculty plan.<br />\nIn last week's vote, the council agreed to a plan that called on<br />\nthe administration to \"require\"<br />\neach program or department to<br />\ndemonstrate aggressive recruiting<br />\nefforts. The council earlier turned down that recommendation in<br />\nfavor of an amended version that<br />\nsaid the university should \"provide incentives\" to help departments step up their recruiting.<br />\nCritics called that a watereddown attempt that would<br />\nperpetuate the status quo.<br />\n\"It was felt by a lot of people<br />\nsymbolically important to word it<br />\none way rather than the other,\"<br />\nsaid Philip Stewart, a professor of<br />\nFrench who heads the faculty<br />\ncouncil.<br />\nH.

The report made a stinging indictment of the Homewood<br />\natmosphere in recommending<br />\nwide-ranging changes in<br />\nHomewood's academic, administrative, and social structure.<br />\nThe report claimed that the<br />\nrelationships between the administration, faculty, staff and<br />\nstudents is at \"the heart of the<br />\nproblems of the human climate,\"<br />\nand noted an \"artificial separation of the community\" that<br />\n\"creates a hierarchy that is elitist<br />\nand exclusive and causes certain<br />\nmembers to feel like second-class<br />\ncitizens.\"<br />\nThe Task Force, composed of<br />\ndozens of administration<br />\nmembers, faculty members and<br />\nstudents, came into being in October, 1986 under a directive<br />\nfrom University President Steven<br />\nMuller to determine the means by<br />\nwhich problems at Homewood<br />\nmay be addressed.<br />\nRecommending the creation of<br />\nan \"office of ombudsperson at a<br />\nhigh administrative level,\" the<br />\nTask Force called for examinations of Homewood governments, personnel policies, and the<br />\nstatus of racial and ethnic<br />\nminorities, especially blacks.<br />\nThe Task Force also recommended a reevaluation of<br />\nundergraduate education and urged the University to find funding<br />\nto develop adequate student<br />\nspace, \"including improvement<br />\nand expansion of the Student<br />\nUnion and Athletic Center<br />\nfacilities and additional University housing.\"<br />\nAlso included in the report<br />\nwere statements criticizing the<br />\npreoccupation of students and<br />\nfaculty with career advancement<br />\nand selfish drives for success.<br />\nThe Task Force also recommended an investigation into the<br />\npossibility of reinstating an honor<br />\ncode.<br />\nSince publication, many<br />\nstudents and administrators have<br />\ninvoked the name of the report in<br />\nproposing activities or changes to<br />\nimprove the quality of life here.<br />\nThe creation of Hoppy Hour has<br />\nproven to be a success, but little<br />\nelse has happened this year to indicate that the report has impacted<br />\nmuch upon decision making, particularly at the administrative<br />\nlevel.<br />\nWe would like to see more<br />\ndone. Minor steps were made to<br />\nchange the tenure policy for professors, and a student group appears on the way to making<br />\nrecommendations on the feasibility of instituting an honor code.<br />\nThe major problem with the<br />\nreport is that implementation of<br />\nmany of the major recommendations would require money, and<br />\nthat money, particularly in light<br /><br />\nof the Arts and Sciences' deficit,<br />\ndoes not appear to be coming.<br />\nThe Human Climate Report,<br />\ntherefore, stands as a base for<br />\nfuture progress.

The stories we presented offered<br />\nundetermined potential for progress: MindBrain, the Ethics Crisis, and the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force Report. And while<br />\npotential is a subjective determination<br />\nwhich feeds the imagination, as the year<br />\ndraws near, the excitement has not been<br />\nreplenished with results.<br />\nWhy results could not be achieved remains mysterious, at all levels of the<br />\nUniversity. It is obviously not sufficient to<br />\npawn off stonewalling on a hostile administration or an ambivalent Student<br />\nCouncil. Rather, if anyone or thing is to<br />\nblame, it might be problematic inertia.<br />\nThere is something about this school that<br />\nmakes it hard to accomplish anything of any<br />\nreal significance.<br />\nIt is not for us to complain, though, that<br />\ngood ideas have not come to their fruition<br />\nin our tenure. To do so would be to suggest ideas might be stifled until the object<br />\nhas been achieved, which is fallacious and<br />\ndangerous reasoning. It is only with the<br />\ncommunication of ideas\u2014and problems\u2014<br />\nthat progress can be made.<br />\nStudents this year were full of projects<br />\nand ideas for and about Hopkins. In fact,<br />\nthere seemed to be a concentration of activity focused not on South Africa or other<br />\npolitical issues, but rather on the direction<br />\nin which Homewood is moving. Two issues<br />\nin particular\u2014the resignation of Dean of<br />\nHomewood Schools Administration Robert<br />\nWelch and the budget deficit in the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences\u2014were of particular<br /><br />\nconcern to students, encouraging them to<br />\ntake a role in setting the course for the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nGetting emotionally involved again has<br />\nits costs. It is hard to listen to President<br />\nMuller insist that the Arts and Sciences<br />\ndeficit would have no effect on our education, and then find out about a plan to shrink<br />\nthe size of the faculty and delay<br />\nconstruction.<br />\nMore frustrating even than that,<br />\nhowever, is that it is hard to be indignant.<br />\nHow do we really know,for example, what<br />\nthe effects of a ten percent decrease in<br />\nfaculty over the next five years will be?<br />\nSure, rationally it means more students to<br />\nfewer faculty, but what does that necessarily mean for an individual student?<br />\nIt would be nice to end the year as<br />\npositively as we started it, with hope and<br />\nexpectation, but all too many of this year's<br />\nexpectations led only to disappointment.<br />\nMaybe, come next fall, some of these confusing issues will be a little clearer.<br />\nWe would like to wish luck to everyone<br />\nleaving Hopkins this spring\u2014especially<br />\nthose who tried to make a difference around<br />\nhere (students and administrators included.)<br />\nMany of those who arrived here a few years<br />\nago with fresh ideas and an abundance of<br />\nenergy might leave feeling a little frustrated<br />\nwith this school; you finally begin to<br />\nunderstand what Hopkins is all about, and<br />\nthen it's time to leave. Just remember that<br />\nyou've perhaps broken the ground with<br />\nyour efforts, and that's no small accomplishment at a place like this.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nA. Lee Davis<br />\nHere I am, receiving requests<br />\nfor donations of a thousand<br />\ndollars from my high school.<br />\nsmall pleas for whatever I can<br />\ngive from the Hopkins alumni<br />\noffice\u2014you would think I was on<br />\nthe eve of becoming a functioning member of society. Hold on,<br />\nI must have gotten on the wrong<br />\ntrain.<br />\nLast week I pulled off the alltime coup of my Hopkins career.<br />\nWhen the flyers which advertised caps and gowns first appeared<br />\nin our Gilman boxes, I spotted the<br />\nname that has hounded me since<br />\nmy pre-frosh days: Barnes &amp; Noble. There on the spot I decided<br />\nI would attend graduation in a suit<br />\nand tie, jams and Wayfarers.<br />\nBVD's and chest hair\u2014anything but in a cap and gown<br />\nrented from B&amp;N.<br />\nA few weeks passed and I missed the deadline for reserving the<br />\nvestments, which was fine with<br />\nme. Lisa, however, was getting<br />\nnervous. When she inquired, she<br />\nwas told it was too late to order<br />\ncaps and gowns. When she asked a B&amp;N representative the<br />\nname of the company that was<br />\nrenting them to B&amp;N so she could<br />\ncontact them herself, she was<br />\ntold, \"You may order them<br />\nthrough Barnes &amp; Noble only.\u2014<br />\nUpon hearing the woeful tale,<br />\nI decided to do a little investigating. In no time at all I had<br />\ncontacted a company downtOwn<br />\nthat would rent me two caps and<br />\ngowns for ten dollars a day.<br />\nWhen I told the salesgirl that I<br />\nneeded them On May 26, she urged me to come in for a fitting<br />\nASAP because they were doing<br />\ncollege graduations during that<br /><br />\ntunc. It didn't take nary two firings of the old neurons to sense<br />\nthat something was going on.<br />\nMy victory was made sweeter<br />\nby the fact that B&amp;N charged $15<br />\nper day. With the late fee, it<br />\nwould be twenty. Young entrepreneurs prick up your ears!<br />\nAlthough I don't know the exact<br />\nsize of our graduating class, with<br />\nall the undergraduate degrees and<br />\ngraduate degrees being awarded<br />\ncome the last week of May. I'd<br />\nsurmise that there will be about<br />\n900 cap/gown combinations<br />\nfloating around campus. At fifteen dollars a head. that's a gross<br />\nof almost fourteen grand.<br />\nSuppose B&amp;N got a bulk rental rate from the uniforms company, say $5 an outfit. That<br />\nleaves nine thousand. Subtract<br />\nminimal operating costs, and<br />\nB&amp;N picks up a pretty healthy<br />\npenny for a day's work. Congratulations to those procrastinators and fellow protestors<br />\nwho also found other options. To<br />\nyou others, lines form on the left<br />\nfor bluing and tattooing.<br />\nAhem. It's a tough subject to<br />\nbroach, but we all know that this<br />\nis the end. Last year. I drove up<br />\nto Ithaca to sec my brother<br />\ngraduate from Cornell. Watching<br />\nthose champagne bottles spit like<br />\nthe froth on a sea of red caps, I<br />\nwas suddenly all choked up. I let<br />\nthe feeling overcome me, hoping<br />\nthat a little vicarious trickle then<br />\nwould prevent a flood when I<br />\nunderwent the same ceremony a<br />\nyear later.<br />\nAs expected. there have been<br />\ngood -times and had times at<br />\nHopkins, in Baltimore. I shan't<br />\nsubject you to an enumeration of<br />\nSee LEE, 11<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br /><br />\nNoam Neusner<br /><br />\nObservina Jewish Holidays<br />\nIn April, Jews observe three<br />\nholidays of seemingly disparate<br />\nmeaning. The first, Passover,<br />\ncelebrates the redemption from<br />\nslavery in Egypt. The second,<br />\nYom Hashoa, is a day of mourning for the Jews who perished in<br />\nthe Holocaust. The third is<br />\nIsrael's Independence Day.<br />\nExcept for Chanukah and the<br />\nHigh Holidays, these three are<br />\ncelebrated by more Jews than any<br />\nother holidays, including the<br />\nweekly Sabbath.<br />\nOn Passover Jewish students,<br />\nfor the most part, celebrated the<br />\nSeder with their families or at<br />\nschool with their friends. On<br />\nYom Hashoa Jewish students at<br />\nHopkins organized a touching and<br />\nthoughtful service mourning the<br />\nloss of 6 million Jews, and on<br />\nIsraeli Independence Day these<br />\nstudents, besides having sponsored a symposium on Israeli<br />\nscience a few weeks earlier,<br />\ncelebrated the cultural and<br />\npolitical significance of Israel.<br />\nIt says a great deal about Jews.<br />\n(and Jewish students, for that<br />\nmatter) that their most observed<br />\nholidays are ones that speak of a<br />\nparticular philosophy, for<br />\nPassover, Yom Hashoa, and<br />\nIsrael Independence Day corn-<br /><br />\nmemorate historical and religious<br />\nredemption from slavery.<br />\nOn Passover we celebrate our<br />\nfreedom from the slavery in<br />\nEgypt. It says in the Passover<br />\nHagadah, \"We were slaves of<br />\nPharoah in Egypt and the Lord<br />\nour God brought us forth from<br />\nthere with a mighty hand and an<br />\noutstretched arm. And if the Holy One had not brought our<br />\nfathers forth from Egypt, then we<br />\nand our descendants would still<br />\nbe slaves to pharoaoh in Egypt.\"<br />\nAnd so it is that we celebrate<br />\nPassover in freedom, not in<br />\nslavery. Each year Jews of different levels of observance tell the<br />\nsame story, some in a more abbreviated form than others, but<br />\nnonetheless with the same purpose: to thank God for this act by<br />\nrepeating it to every successive<br />\ngeneration.<br />\nYom Hashoa was placed<br />\nstrategically (by the Israelis, one<br />\nwould assume) one week before<br />\nIsraeli Independence Day precisely because the Shoah is perceived as the slavery before the<br />\nredemption, the creation of a<br />\nJewish state.<br />\nIt is not so much an historical<br />\noutlook as much as a spiritual<br />\none. Israel was not created<br /><br />\nbecause of the Shoah (although<br />\nthere was obviously more support<br />\nfor a Jewish state after the<br />\nHolocaust), but instead, Israel is<br />\nseen as the redemption from the<br />\nmodern version of slavery in<br />\nEgypt, the Nazi plan to destroy<br />\nthe Jewish people.<br />\nIt is particularly thoughtprovoking that Jewish students<br />\nshould identify with these<br />\nholidays so closely. That Jewish<br />\nstudents should consistently<br />\ncelebrate the crises and triumphs<br />\nof the Jewish nation but not the<br />\nrites and rituals of the Jewish<br />\nreligion makes one thing clear:<br />\nJewish students, on the whole,<br />\ncelebrate their Jewishness as a<br />\npeople, not as a religion.<br />\nIt is also easier to raise the interests of Jewish students by appealing to their concerns as a<br />\npolitical entity.<br />\nWitness the most recent focal<br />\npoints for Jewish students' concerns: one, the current rioting in<br />\nIsrael which has all but ended<br />\nIsrael's once peaceful relationship<br />\nwith her Arab citizens, and two,<br />\nthe impossible situation for Jews<br />\nin Russia.<br /><br />\nSee HOLIDAY, 11<br /><br />\nEditors<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nJulie Levine, Flory Ware<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

For example,<br />\nwhen posed with the potentially<br />\nexplosive issue of ordaining<br />\nfemale rabbis, Jewish students<br />\nobserve an uncharacteristic<br />\nsilence. The same is true for their<br />\nnon-reaction to attacks on Reform<br />\nJudaism from ultra-Orthodox<br />\nJews. Should we interpret this<br /><br />\nsilence as indifference to<br />\nJudaism?<br />\nThe answer to that question is<br />\nno. Jewish students are concerned with the political battles which<br />\ndiscuss Jewish freedom and survival because they act out the<br />\nstory of redemption and slavery<br />\nrepeated in the Passover service<br />\nand in the observance of Yom<br />\nHashoah and Israeli Independence Day.<br />\nWe were slaves in Egypt, yet<br /><br />\nwe do not want to be slaves in<br />\nIsrael to a potentially dangerous<br />\nPalestinian state.<br />\nJewish students are not concerned with infra-religious struggles because the freedom of Jews<br />\neverywhere is not yet a fact.<br />\nJudaism as a religion has not<br />\nlost any significance; it did not<br />\nhave as much as we might have<br />\nwanted to believe.

Our opposition to this work is consistent with our<br />\nlongstanding testimony of nonviolence. George Fox stated it<br />\nclearly: \"We utterly deny all outward wars and strife and<br />\nfighting with outward weapons, for any end or under any pretense whatsoever\" (1661).<br />\nIn addition to our spiritual perspective, there is a need to<br />\nconsider this in relation to the mission of the University.<br />\nIntended as an institution of education and healing, Hopkins<br />\nis now a major military contractor, top among universities.<br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) engages in research on<br />\nsome of the most ethically controversial weapons systems<br />\ncurrently under development. The APL's work on missile guidance<br />\nsystems is critical to the development of the Pentagon's Cruise<br />\nand Trident II programs. By accepting work on these nuclear<br />\nweapons systems, as well as the Strategic Defense Initiative,<br />\nthe University is contributing to the dangers of a nuclear<br />\nholocaust.<br />\nWe believe the University has a respopslbility to provide an<br />\nethical framework for students, and to fulfill this, must consider the moral implications of its own endeavors. No institution<br />\ncan hope to foster social responsibility in students unless it<br />\nis itself socially responsible. It is inappropriate for The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University to be associated with a military laboratory. We urge you to cease the APL's work for the Pentagon,<br />\nor to sever ties 4ifetween the APL and the University.<br />\nMay we have the opportunity to discuss this matter with you?<br />\nSi)acerely,<br /><br />\n\u201e<br />\nAnne C.W.

Would it be<br />\nfair to say that because one<br />\nfreshman makes sweeping<br />\ngeneralizations that all freshmen<br />\nare so closed-minded as to do the<br />\nsame? Certainly not.<br />\nIf Ruck doesn't know of any<br />\nengineering professors with \"half<br />\nthe devotion\" for the engineering<br />\nstudents as Robert Arellano had<br />\nfor the writing seminars students,<br />\nlet me enlighten him.

Professors Cammarata of Materials Science,<br />\nJones of Civil Engineering,<br />\nNaiman of Mathematical<br />\nSciences, and Revelle of<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering also care about their<br />\nstudents. In fact, I can only think<br />\nof two professors that fit Ruck's<br />\nunflattering description.

It<br />\nseems they'd found Marcy<br />\nslumped over his desk that morning, killed by three bullets fired<br />\nfrom his own gun. The only<br />\nprints on the gun were those of<br />\nMarcy and his wife. They were<br />\nholding her now for questioning.<br />\nBill took me to the room where<br />\nshe was and let me have a few<br />\nminutes with her.<br />\n\"Oh, Mac, thank God you're<br />\nhere,\" she said, practically launching herself at me as she started<br />\nto cry.<br />\n\"There, there,\" I said. Tears<br />\nstreamed from her eyes. I found<br />\nmyself more and more attracted<br />\nto her; but I had a rule never to<br />\nget involved with clients.(Well,<br />\nit was more of a guideline than a<br />\nrule.) I restrained myself and continued,\"Now calm down and tell<br />\nme what happened.\"<br />\n\"Last night when Phil came<br />\nhome, I confronted him.

His opportunity will ultimately come at<br />\nthe death of Urbino in chapter<br />\none, when the old doctor falls<br />\nfrom a mango tree while trying<br />\nto reach his precious, Latinspeaking parrot.

Garcia Marquez has written a novel<br />\nof life, where the growth of<br />\ncharacters is emphasized, and has<br />\nenclosed it in the shell of a novel<br />\nof fate, where opposing forces<br />\nmust come to a head at the<br />\nnovel's close. It is the fatalistic<br />\npremise that kicks off the story<br />\n(that gray-haired Fermina must<br />\neither accept or reject Fiorentino)<br />\nthat carries the reader effortlessly through the rest of the story.<br />\nAnd at the narrative's wrap-up,<br />\nafter letting us in on the intimate<br />\ndetails of each of the relationships, Garcia Marquez has the<br />\nreader championing Fiorentino,<br />\nwishing against reason that Fermina, stron. and determined like<br /><br />\nmost of the women of the story,<br />\nwill accept her fate and live out<br />\nher days with Fiorentino on the<br />\nriver.<br />\nThematically, Love in the Time<br />\nofCholera is seamless. The story<br />\nquestions if innocent desire is<br />\npossible in the adult world. The<br />\npitting of pure love versus cool<br />\nreality establishes the subtextual<br />\ntension. In his speech to the<br />\nNobel Prize Committee in 1982,<br />\nGarcia Marquez explained that it<br />\nis the writer's obligation to create<br />\nUtopia. His story must sing the<br />\nprais of love against any odds,<br />\nof love in the time of lost hope,<br />\nof love in the time of anger, even<br />\nof love in the time of cholera.<br />\nGarcia Marquez, who has written<br />\nmysteries and melodramas,<br />\nelevating each style to new artistic<br />\nheights, brings the love story to<br />\napical proportions with his uncanny, distanced narrator's voice; it<br />\nis the voice of an infant Grandfather, held by the trappings of<br />\ninnocence in a naive youth, but<br />\ntaken by nature into old age. The<br /><br />\ntone, like the theme, expresses<br />\nthe exclusivity of realism and<br />\nidealism. All of which is resolved in a magnificent and stunning<br />\nconclusion.<br />\nThe story contains the requisite<br />\nscenes of shock: gossip, sex, and<br />\nviolence. But Garcia Marquez,<br />\nwho has never shied from traditional reader interests, manages<br />\nto encorporate the crowd-pleasers<br />\ninto the fabric of the narrative so<br />\nflawlessly, they are immaculately believable; hence, the real<br />\nmagic of the story. Love in the<br />\nTime of Cholera, already a bestseller around the world, is destined to become another classic,<br />\nkeeping pace with (some would<br />\nsay even surpassing) One Hundred Years ofSolitude. To which<br />\nmany of his readers must think:<br />\nthat Garcia Marquez would write<br />\nanother work of astonishment,<br />\nlike of the reminiscence at the<br />\nscent of bitter almonds, was<br />\ninevitable.<br /><br />\nOFFICERS' TRAINING<br /><br />\nCORPS<br /><br />\nGARDNER REALTY CORP.<br />\nMANHATTAN'S FOREMOST<br />\nAPT.

Dermatologists are concerned with<br />\ngrowing evidence which shows<br />\nthat tanning contributes vitamin<br />\ndeficiencies and night blindness.<br />\nMore important, however, is the<br />\nsharp increase in cases of<br />\nreported skin cancer. The<br />\nAmerican Academy of Dermatology predicts that half a<br />\nmillion Americans will develop<br />\nskin cancer this year. The lifetime risk of melanoma, the most<br />\ndangerous type of skin cancer, is<br />\nup 900 percent since 1930.<br />\nMalignant melanoma affects<br />\nnearly 25,000 people annually<br />\nand of this number each year,<br />\nabout 5500 die. As a whole,<br />\nAmericans are aware of the<br />\ndangers of tanning and try to<br />\nshield themselves with the<br />\nvarious sunscreens on the market.<br />\nBut sunscreens offer only limited<br />\nprotection.<br />\nSo why do people gamble with<br />\ntheir health while the media is<br />\nteeming with sun warnings? All<br />\nAmerica loves a tan. Many<br />\nbelieve that this love affair with<br />\nsunshine is purely psychological.<br />\nPeople like the look and feel of<br />\na tan. But only recently has the<br />\ntan truly come into vogue. Before<br />\nthe fifties, a tan was the sign of<br />\na worker, like a field hand, who<br />\ncould not afford to be sheltered<br />\nfrom the sun. But fads come and<br /><br />\ngo. today, a tan is a sign of<br />\nleisure, carefree youth, spring<br />\nbreak in Fort Lauderdale, or tennis at the club. The result of tans<br />\nbecoming such a status symbol,<br />\nhowever, is that people do not<br />\nwant to listen to what doctors<br />\nhave to say about the dangers of<br />\nsuntanning.<br />\nThe Tanning Process<br />\nDuring the tanning process, exposure to sunlight triggers special<br />\nskin cells to release melanin, a<br />\nprotective pigment, onto the surface. Melanin causes the skin to<br />\nthicken and absorb only a fraction<br />\nof the ultraviolet(UV)rays from<br />\nsunlight. This thickened skin tries<br />\nto scatter the remainder of the UV<br />\nrays and prevent them from<br />\npenetrating to deeper layers of<br />\nHence, the upper melanincovered layers become \"tanned\"<br />\nwhen they absorb the UV rays.<br />\nUnfortunately, all of these rays<br />\ncannot be absorbed or scattered<br />\nduring long periods of exposure.<br />\nWhat people interpret as a healthy<br />\nresponse to the sun is actually the<br />\nbody trying to shield itself.<br />\nThe Damage<br />\nUV rays come in two varieties<br />\nof wavelengths: alpha (a) which<br />\nare longer waves and beta (b)<br />\nwhich are shorter. Beta waves are<br />\nmore effective for tanning but are<br />\nmore dangerous. These waves are<br />\nconcentrated around midday.<br />\nAlthough UV-A rays are not as<br />\ndangerous as UV-B rays, neither<br />\nof them are considered safe.<br /><br />\nHarry Targovnik, a radiotherapist<br />\nat Mount Sinai Medical Center in<br />\nNew York, found that high doses<br />\nof UV-A rays can inhibit the enzyme necessary for the DNA<br />\nrepair which follows the damage<br />\ncaused by UV-B rays.<br />\nResearch shows that UV radiation can cause imbalances in the<br />\nmolecular structure of DNA,<br />\nwhich leads to cancer. Other<br />\nsuspected health hazards include:<br />\nthe suppression of the immune<br />\nsystem, promotion of cataracts,<br />\nand toxic reactions in people taking antibiotics. The most<br />\ndevastating of these health<br />\nhazards, however, is skin cancer.<br />\nSkin cancer is the uncontrolled<br />\ngrowth of cell layers. All three<br />\ntypes of skin cancer (basal<br />\nsquamous and melanoma)can be<br />\ncured if treated in time. Malignant melanoma is the least common of the three; however, it is<br />\nby far the most dangerous. Basal<br />\nand squamous cell cancer are the<br />\nresult of cumulative sun exposure<br />\nwhile melanoma is triggered by<br />\nblistering sunburns from<br />\nchildhood and adolescence. Dr.<br />\nSidney Hurwitz, clinical professor of pediatrics and dermatology at the Yale School of<br />\nMedicine, says that children that<br />\nget sunburned double their<br />\nchances for developing malignant<br />\nmelanoma in later life.<br />\nProtection<br />\nSo, what can sun worshippers<br />\ndo for protection'? Use sunscreen.<br />\nEven a seemingly safe overcast<br />\nday will let in up to 80 percent of<br /><br />\nthe UV rays. Being underwater<br />\nhas the same effect. And despite<br />\nour thinking that the dangerous<br />\nsun is only at the beach. UV rays<br />\n,do not stop at arms hanging out<br />\nof car windows or legs walking<br />\naround parks. For these reasons,<br />\nusing a sunscreen is important for<br />\nany stay in the sun.<br />\nDermatologists recognize six<br />\ncategories of pigment from very<br />\nfair to deeply colored. From these<br />\ncategories, dermatologists have<br />\nassigned varying strengths of<br />\nsunscreens, ranging form 2 for<br />\nminimal protection to 32 for maximum protection. The Skin<br />\nCancer Fondation, however,<br />\nrecommends using a sunscreen<br />\nwith no less a protection rating<br />\nthan 15. Sunscreens are rated according to their \"sun protection<br />\nfactor\" or SPF. SPF multiplies<br />\nthe amount of time that a bather<br />\ncan stay in the sun by a factor of<br />\nthe product. For example, using<br />\na sunscreen with an SPF of 2<br />\nallows the user to stay in the sun<br />\ntwice as long as they could<br />\nwithout protection before burning. Most of these products convariation of<br />\ntain some<br />\nparaminobenzoic acid (PABA)<br />\nwhich is found in all living cells<br />\nand absorbs some of the UV rays.<br />\nPABA is usually combined with<br />\nUV-A screens like benzophenomes or anthranilates for<br />\nadded protection.<br />\nThe problem is that sunscreens<br />\ncan only offer a limited amount<br />\nof protection. Excessive use of<br />\nsunscreens inhibit the body's production of vitamin D. The precursor to vitamin D is 7-dehydro-<br /><br />\ncholesterol, a steroid which is excreted onto the skin's surface.<br />\nThrough a photochemical reaction with UV-B radiation, the previtamin D is spontaneously converted into vitamin D and is absorbed back into the skin. According to scientists at the University of Illinois, sunscreens interfere<br />\nwith the vitamin's production by<br />\nabsorbing the radiation necessary<br />\nfor its synthesis.<br />\nTo avoid the dangers of<br />\nultraviolet radiation, tan worshippers try tan accelerators and tanning pills. Tan accelerators, when<br />\napplied several days prior to tanning, contain the chemical<br />\nprecursor to melanin so that the<br />\nskin tans faster, decreasing the<br />\namount of time in the sun. Tanning pills, however, have little to<br />\ndo with the body's natural tanning mechanism. In fact, they contain coloring pigments which do<br />\nnothing for the skin except turn<br />\nit orange. But tanning pills have<br />\nan unexpected side effect. European studies reveal that consumers who have taken the pills<br />\nfor an extended amount of time<br />\nfind it hard to adapt their vision<br />\nat twilight and at night. This<br />\nblindness is a result of crystalline<br />\nstructures of the main coloring<br />\npigment, canthaxanthin, building<br />\nup on the retina.<br />\nDermatologists agree that the<br />\nbest protection in the sun is the<br />\nshade. Simply stay out of the sun.<br />\nIf one must go in, wear a hat and<br />\nlong sleeves.<br /><br />\nTaking off all that unwanted winter flab<br />\nby Brook Wiers<br />\nSo you've got a little soft<br />\ntissue, some flab around the<br />\nmidriff, or maybe it has gone a<br />\nlittle beyond that.

Well, cheer up\u2014you've<br />\ngot a lot of worth as a human being, and beauty is only skin deep.<br />\nThe above is true, but if you'd<br />\nlike to do something about those<br />\nextra pounds, read on.<br />\nWhy people are overweight<br />\nBefore you can do something<br />\nabout a problem, it helps to know<br />\na little about it. Perhaps it would<br />\nhelp to review a couple of<br />\ntheories on how people become<br />\nand remain overweight:<br />\nFat cells\u2014Adipose tissue cells<br />\nare the cells in your body which<br />\nstore fat. As an adolescent, one<br />\ngains weight by increasing the<br />\nnumber of fat cells (hyperplasia),<br />\nwhich all stay in one uniform<br />\nsize, more or less.<br />\nAs an adult fewer new fat cells<br />\nare formed, but each already existing one increases in size<br />\n(hypertrophy) as weight is<br />\ngained.<br />\nThere is some indication that<br />\ndieters can lose weight until all<br />\ntheir fat cells have shrunk to normal size, and then they will lose<br /><br />\nno more. Since a fat cell once<br />\ngained is never lost, this is bad<br />\nnews for people who became<br />\noverweight as adolescents.<br />\nLiposuction, which would permanently remove fat cells, is an<br />\nalternative treatment.<br />\nOvereating\u2014Studies have<br />\nshown that overeating is encouraged when foods have high<br />\nfat content and are available in a<br />\nwide variety. Sweetness of food<br />\nalso contributes. Sounds like the<br />\ntypical American diet, doesn't it?<br />\nWhen you see a person in the<br />\ncafeteria eating three peas and a<br />\nglass of water for dinner, pay<br />\nattention\u2014he or she may be on to<br />\nsomething; the low fat content<br />\nand variety will make the food<br />\nseem unappealing, and he or she<br />\nwill eat less.<br />\nWhat can be done to combat<br />\nobesity.<br />\nThe central idea is that your<br />\nbody has an energy balance between intake and output. The<br />\ndieter's goal is to make energy<br />\noutput exceed energy input, forcing the body to make up the difference by burning away its<br />\nenergy reserves, which are fat.<br />\nFirst, let's address energy output. The big factor over which<br />\nyou have some voluntary control<br />\nis exercise. The most obvious<br />\nbenefit of exercise is energy<br /><br />\nexercise couldn't hurt. But what<br />\nsort of exercise program is right<br />\nfor you?<br />\nIn terms of type of exercise,<br />\nprobably aerobic would be best.<br />\nAerobic exercise is steady exercise wich elevates your heartrate<br />\nto \"at least 70% of the maximum.\" Some common exercises<br />\nmight be jogging, stationary cycling, aerobic dance, rowing, and<br />\nswimming.<br />\nIn addition to burning up<br />\ncalories, aerobic exercise tends to<br />\nimprove components of fitness<br />\nsuch as flexibility and muscular<br />\nand cardiovascular endurance.<br />\nThat's aerobic exercise's advantage over something more<br />\nanaerobic like weight lifting,<br />\nwhich burns calories but doesn't<br />\nhave these salutary effects.<br />\nOf course, working out with<br />\nweights to tone up muscles after<br />\nsome aerobic exercise would be<br />\nfine. If you're like most people,<br />\nthough, you may just not have the<br />\nenergy to do all that in one shot,<br />\nand, if you tried to do it all, you<br />\nmight become discouraged with<br />\nyour program and eventually<br />\nquit.<br />\nWhich brings us to the second<br />\nimportant part of designing an exercise program\u2014adherence.

That doesn't<br />\nSo you've decided a little more mean you should get down on<br /><br />\nexpenditure\u2014calories will be<br />\nburnt. Exercise also has several<br />\nmore subtle effects for the dieter.<br />\n1) Exercise will increase your<br />\nbasal metabolism\u2014normally<br />\ndieting's restriction of caloric intakes causes your body to reduce<br />\nits rate of metabolic energy output by 15 to 30%, and you're<br />\nback where you started. Exercise<br />\ncounteracts this drop.<br />\n2) Normally when you diet,<br />\n25% of the pounds you lose are<br />\nactually lost lean tissue (muscle).<br />\nExercise will alter the ratio of loss<br />\nof fat to muscle so that 95% of<br />\nall weight lost will be fat.<br />\n3) Exercise suppresses<br />\nappetite\u2014a nifty little side effect.<br />\n4) Lastly, but still importantly,<br />\nexercise can counter some of the<br />\nill effects of obesity such as<br />\nelevated plasma insulin levels<br />\n(related to diabetes) and elevated<br />\nplasma lipid levels (linked to<br />\nhealthy.<br />\nheart disease).<br />\nIn addition to all these positive<br />\neffects, exercise will also counter<br />\nnegative<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nsome<br />\npsychological effects of being<br />\noverweight, such as low selfesteem\u2014you've gone out and<br />\ndone something good for your<br />\nbody, and you can feel proud of<br />\nthat.<br /><br />\nyourself for not doing it\u2014instead,<br />\ndesign a program that you will<br />\nstick to.<br />\nBe especially sure to keep in<br />\nmind that you are an individual<br />\nand that this program is designed<br />\njust for you; don't be bothered by<br />\nthe fact that others can do more,<br />\nor do it more quickly. That's fine<br />\nfor them, but your program is for<br />\nyou.<br />\nExercise physiologists and<br />\nbehaviorists have come up with<br />\nsome helpful tips that can help<br />\nyou to stay with your program:<br />\n1) Start at low intensity and<br />\nmake changes gradually. This is<br />\nan exercise program which could<br />\nlast your whole life, so there's no<br />\nneed to push things.<br />\n2) Set goals and be sure to<br />\nreward yourself when you<br />\nachieve them. In fact, try to encourage yourself every step of the<br />\nway. This process of positive<br />\nreinforcement is important in<br />\nestablishing a positive mental attitude toward exercising. In setting goals, note that time-based<br />\ngoals are mentally easier to take<br />\nthan distance-based goals.<br />\n3) Get some social support for<br />\nyour exercise by exercising with<br />\nothers.

It happened two weeks<br />\nago in College Park when Navy<br />\nfaced the highly touted Terps of<br />\nMaryland. Just 26 seconds into<br />\nthe first overtime, Mike Herger<br />\ntook a pass from Brian Keith and<br />\nsailed it past Maryland goalie<br />\nDennis Sullivan. The goal not only sealed an 8-7 upset for the<br />\nMidshipmen, but it made Navy a<br />\nserious contender in the race for<br />\nthe NCAA Lacrosse National<br />\nTitle.<br />\nThe secret to victory was ball<br />\ncontrol, and the Midshipmen executed it to perfection. Herger<br />\nand the rest of the the Middie attack did an excellent job of keeping the ball away from the explosive Terrapin offense. When<br />\nthe Terps did mount an offensive<br />\nsurge, senior goalie Joe Donnelly was there to stop them, as he<br />\nmade 12 saves and held Maryland<br />\nto only 7 goals on 42 shots. Thus,<br />\nHerger's third goal of the afternoon was enough to give Navy<br />\nit's third consecutive victory and<br />\na place among the college<br />\nlacrosse elite.<br />\nLast week, Navy proved that<br />\ntheir victory over Maryland was<br />\nno fluke, as they handed Virginia<br />\ntheir second straight defeat by a<br />\nscore of 7-5. Plagued by penalties<br />\nin the first half. Navy fell behind<br />\n5-2 despite some brilliant play<br />\nfrom Donnelly and the defensive<br />\ncrew of Nick Amaturio, Jim Darcy, and Tony Iuculano.

The<br />\nLady Jays continued their streak<br />\nlast Wednesday against Gettysburg with four record-breaking<br />\nperformances. Krista Johnson<br />\nand Mary Gifford ran 26.2 and<br />\n26.3 in the 200 meter dash,<br />\nknocking a whole second off of<br />\nGifford's old record of 27.25,<br />\nwhile Valerie Wilson and Laura<br />\nPerlinn ran 17.1 and 17.2 in the<br />\n100 meter hurdles to slip under<br />\nthe 1984 record of 17.3.<br />\nOverall, Hopkins placed second at the Swarthmore tri-meet<br />\nwith 35 points behind Messiah<br />\n(89 points) and ahead of Swarthmore (24 points). All three<br />\nteams knew that Messiah, the<br />\n1987 MAC Champions, would<br />\nrun away with most of the points,<br />\nso the main battle was between<br />\nHopkins and Swarthmore for second place. The Lady Jays appeared to be at a big disadvantage<br />\nbecause Swarthmore had beaten<br />\nthem the last five years in a row.<br />\nHopkins was also missing their<br />\ntwo best middle-distance runners,<br />\nSuzi McGinn and Diana Logan,<br />\ndue to injuries, and they agian<br />\nhad no women competing in the<br />\nhigh jump, shot put, discus or<br />\njavelin. Despite these shortcomings, Hopkins took first in three<br />\nevents through the efforts of<br />\nMary Gifford in the 100, Johnson<br />\nin the 200, and Perlinn in the 400<br />\nhurdles, who were supported by<br />\nnumerous second, third and<br />\nfourth place points from the 400<br />\nrelay team, Wilson and Perlinn in<br />\nthe 100 hurdles, April Savoye in<br />\nthe 400, Molly Bardsley in the<br />\n1500 and 3000, Johnson in the<br />\n100, and Gifford in the 200 and<br /><br />\nlong jump.<br />\nIn the 84-50 loss to Gettysburg<br />\nCollege on Wednesday, April 27,<br />\nHopkins did much better than the<br />\nscore shows, especially considering the fact that Gettysburg beat<br />\nthem last year 100-31. This year,<br />\nthe Lady Jays were ahead 42-40<br />\nin the running events but with no<br />\nHopkins entries in the high jump<br />\nor the field events. Gettysburg<br />\npicked up 36 free points and won<br />\nthe meet easily. The women earned first place points from the 4 X<br />\n100(Perlinn, Logan, Savoye, and<br />\nJohnson), Gifford in the 100,<br />\nJohnson in the 200, Perlinn in the<br />\n400 meter hurdles, McGinn in the<br />\n800, and Bardsley in the 3000,<br />\nwho ran a personal best of 11:07.<br />\nThe women travel to Pennsylvania tomorrow to compete in<br />\nthe Millersville Metric Invitational, a meet renowned for producing fast times 'due to the fully<br />\nautomatic timing and swift track.<br />\nOne week later they're off to<br />\nWestern Maryland for the grand<br />\nfinale, the MAC Championship<br />\nmeet.

The Human<br />\nClimate Task Force recognized<br />\nthis issue, yet so little seems to be<br />\npromoted. Student Council as<br />\nwell as the GRO would be doing<br />\na service to the Hopkins community if they worked together.<br />\nReligion\u2014It's time that the administration realize the importance and the influence of the<br />\nvarious religious communities at<br />\nHopkins. Once this is done,<br /><br />\nmaybe some real support and encouragement can be provided for<br />\nthe different communities.<br />\nAs for the leaders of the<br />\nvarious religious communities\u2014<br />\nit's time you started working<br />\ntogether. Speaking from personal<br />\nexperience, some of you can't see<br />\nbeyond your own concerns. I<br />\nstrongly encourage you to start<br />\ndoing so. First, think about the<br />\npurpose of religion, then consider<br />\nyour responsibilities to Hopkins.<br />\nSomething that I haven't heard<br />\nanything about and haven't asked about is a student chapel. For<br />\nan administration which claims to<br />\nbe concerned about student life,<br />\nthey sure ignore a significant part<br />\nof many people's lives. Hopkins<br />\nis a university. This should mean<br />\nthat it is open to all ideas. A nondenominational student chapel<br />\nwould only mean acknowledging<br />\nthat religion and faith do play an<br />\nimportant part in many people's<br />\nlives. The University would only be showing its maturity in supporting a chapel, instead of its<br />\nfear in dealing with anything<br />\nreligiously connected. The ditch<br />\nbehind the Glass Pay would be a<br />\nnice place\u2014something tells me<br />\nalumni would find the money to<br />\nsupport this effort. I hope the<br />\nUniversity is sincere in its efforts<br />\nto improve student life and student relationships. I hope religion<br />\nis an area the University will<br />\nacknowledge.<br />\nChaplain's Office\u2014For those<br />\nof you who don't know, there's<br />\na Religious Life Committee on<br />\ncampus under the auspices of the<br />\nChaplain. This committee needs<br />\nto set some goals, decide whether<br />\nthey are going to work together<br />\nand then actually do something.<br />\nInterfaith retreats, discussion<br />\ngroups, dinners. . . There also<br />\nneeds to be an outreach to<br />\nstudents. The Chaplain has many<br />\na responsibility. The only comment I would make here is that<br />\nthere should be more concern<br />\nwith the campus\u2014i.e. campus<br />\ngroups, campus issues, etc. I<br />\ndon't think that diatribes in stu-<br /><br />\ndent publications help the<br />\nHopkins community. If the goal<br />\nis to raise awareness, there are<br />\nother, more decent ways to<br />\nachieve this. One of the things I<br />\nhave mentioned consistently during the past few weeks is that the<br />\nDean of Student's office is accessible. Susan Boswell is accessible. Try these people before<br />\nthrowing a public tirade, which<br />\nwill only cause the other side to<br />\nbecome defensive.<br />\nSpring Fair\u2014Congrats to the<br />\nchair people.

Since<br />\nthen, the Blue Jays have defeated<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, Notre<br />\nDame, and Mary Washington to<br />\nbring their winning streak to 7.<br />\nThe MAC finals, to be played<br />\nat an undetermined site on May<br />\n7, will mark the first appearance<br />\nof Johns Hopkins in the playoffs.<br />\nThe opposition will come from<br />\nthe winner of the Drew vs.<br />\nFranklin and Marshall game on<br />\nSaturday. Meanwhile, the Jays<br />\nhave additional regular season<br />\ngames scheduled against Hood<br />\nand Georgetown.<br />\nCoach Sally Beth Anderson<br />\nplans to keep the pressure on her<br />\nteam for the last two games in<br />\norder to remain in contention for<br />\na bid to the NCAA Division III<br />\nfinal tournament. At present,<br /><br />\nHopkins is ranked second in the<br />\nNCAA Southern Region and is<br />\nfavorite to capture the bid. Firstranked Roanoke, winner over<br />\nHopkins earlier in the season, is<br />\nexpected to get the lone automatic<br />\nqualifying position for the<br />\nSouthern Region.<br />\nThe veteran Blue Jay squad,<br />\nnow 10 and 2, features two of last<br />\nyear's All-America players in<br />\nHeather Klink and Alice Collins.<br />\nCenter Heather Klink has been a<br />\ntower of strength at both ends of<br />\nthe field. Alice Collins is the<br />\nleading scorer with 31 goals.<br />\nBoth are from Baltimore.<br />\nMaggie Schmidt, of Gibson<br />\nIsland, Maryland, leads Hopkins<br />\nin assists with a total of 25 to add<br />\nto her 22 goals. Kathy Hart(Middletown, DE) is also a key point<br />\nproducer with 27 goals and 4<br />\nassists. Other starters in the offensive midfield are Patty Lagator<br />\nof Timonium and Kara Tipton of<br />\nAbingdon. MD. Tipton is one of<br />\nthe only two freshmen to break<br />\ninto the lineup.<br /><br />\nThe other freshman has been<br />\nlife-saver to the Jays. The team's<br />\nhopes had received a setback early in the year when first string<br />\ngoalie Laura Porter (Lincoln<br />\nPark, NJ) was injured. Disappointment turned to despair when<br />\nher replacement in the goal,<br />\nDawn Nee (Upper Darby, PA),<br />\ncontacted mononucleosis. Coach<br />\nAnderson then prevailed upon<br />\nmidfielder<br />\nKristin<br />\nCole<br />\n(Boothwyn, PA)to take a shot at<br />\nthe goalie position. Anderson's<br />\nchoice turned out to be an excellent one, and Cole's play has<br />\nbeen a welcome surprise that has<br />\nmade the difference in several<br />\ngames.<br />\nDefense has been the key to<br />\nHopkins' victories, according to<br />\nCoach Anderson. Leaders on the<br />\nclose defense are Julie Seigrist<br />\n(Pasadena, MA), Erica Feller<br />\n(Washington, DC), and Liz Davis<br />\n(Newport, RI). Defensive midfielders are Jennifer Stahl<br />\n(Scarsdale, NY) and Carrie<br />\nAllalemdjian (Huntington, NY).<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/31<br /><br />\nampus<br /><br />\nnotei<br />\nnotoi<br /><br />\nampui<br /><br />\n7/0(e3<br /><br />\nC<br />\nC<br />\nC<br /><br />\nampui<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nampus<br /><br />\nnote3<br />\nnotes<br />\nnotes<br />\nnotes<br /><br />\nf-1<br />\nL___ampui<br /><br />\n7/ote3<br /><br />\nCampui<br />\ncl<br />\nLampu3<br /><br />\np<br />\nLampu3<br /><br />\nC<br />\nnotei<br />\nC<br />\nnotes<br />\nC<br />\nnolei<br />\nC<br />\nCampus note<br />\nn0te3<br />\nC<br />\nnotei<br />\nC<br />\nampus<br /><br />\nnava<br /><br />\nampus<br /><br />\nampus<br />\nampus<br /><br />\nampus<br /><br />\nampus<br /><br />\nThe Caribbean Interest Group's<br />\nsponsoring a lecture by Dr. Franklin<br />\nKnight, Mini-states, macro-powers: a<br />\ncase study of the Jamaican economy.<br />\n5.30 p.m. Monday, May 2 in the Garrett Room, MSE.<br />\nTonight try something different, real<br />\ndifferent!
