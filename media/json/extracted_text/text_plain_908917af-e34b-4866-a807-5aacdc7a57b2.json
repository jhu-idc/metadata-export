Such an event needs no recommendation from the NEWS-LETTER. In common with every editor \u2022<br />\nbefore us, we urge the undergraduates to attend. Officials of the<br />\nUniversity have spent months in arranging a program which will<br />\nbe impressive and interesting. Surely the student can forget the<br />\ndaily grind of studies and activities for one day, and be present<br />\nat an event which will bring home to him, perhaps for the first<br />\ntime, the importance and magnitude of his university.<br />\n<br />\nDIME DIPLOMACY<br />\nAgain we take our hats off to the Interfraternity Board.<br />\nIt was generally thought that last year that august body, with its<br />\nquick convictions and dollar fines, had set a shining example of<br />\nwhat not to do. Last Monday, however, the members surpassed<br />\nthemselves. They appear as loath to spend money for cups as<br />\nthey were to collect it in the form of fines. In this effort to<br />\nrival the Coolidge administration in economy, all notions of fair<br />\nplay and all sense of obligation seems to have been forgotten.<br />\nA few years ago the Board instituted an Interfraternity baseball tournament. The plan succeeded famously, and the tournament became an annual event. Not least among the factors in<br />\nthe success of the idea was the silver loving cup presented each<br />\nyear to the winning fraternity.<br />\n.Last year when the appointed time had rolled around the<br />\nbaseball games were played as usual. Delta Gamma Theta put<br />\nout a nine which routfd all of Its rivals and won the championship together with a perfectly valid claim to the cup. The trophy,<br />\nhowever, was not forthcoming; the Board, perhaps, was in financial difficulty, having collected only two dollars in fines.<br />\nThe delegates, proverbially open minded, did not want to see<br />\nbaseball<br />\nvictors cheated out of their cup; so last Monday they<br />\nthe<br />\nproceeded to set matters right by voting them out of it in an<br />\neminently legal manner. Since cups are expensive and since<br />\nthe winner of two years ago naturally refused to give up its trophy,<br />\nthe Board, prudent in money matters, wisely decided that, beginning with last year, there should be but one cup, which should<br />\ncirculate from chapter house to chapter house until the end of<br />\ntime.<br />\nIf the ruling were to go into effect this season, it might deserve commendation. But a retroactive ruling which deprives a<br />\nfraternity of a trophy they won honorably is another matter entirely. Sometime ago we spoke of the \"dollar diplomacy\" of the<br />\nInterfraternity Board;'now, it seems, they have shifted their attention to even smaller denominations.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMAILBAG<br />\nTHOSE GENTLE SOLDIERS<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nCritics of the R. 0. T. C. have<br />\nseized the opportunity presented by<br />\nthe Frederick Y. M. C. A. conference's hostile resolution to again try<br />\nto blackball and belittle the former<br />\norganization.

One wonders at their<br />\npersistence in such a patently ridiculous ideal. Polite signs are<br />\nplastered throughout our otherwise dignified hall-ways; keennosed professors have traced the errant smoke-wisps of Camels,<br />\nChesterfields, and the distinctly collegiate Lucky Strikes to their<br />\ninnocent sources; the omnipresent decrepit janitor spends his peaceful hours reminding the undergraduate of rules;\u2014and the undergraduate smokes<br />\nOne reason for the stubbornness of the janitors may be contained in their unwillingness to soil their brooms.<br />\nNo habitual smoker among Hopkins students ever leaves a<br />\n<br />\nMANAGING EDITOR.<br />\n<br />\nTelephone<br />\n<br />\nJ.<br />\n<br />\nBUSINESS MANA-<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nbuilding merely for the purpose of catching a drag. He becomes<br />\nadept at palming his cigarette when passing Dr. Latane's office,<br />\nhe learns to apprehend the moment of the janitor's shuffling appearance, and he makes a habit of opening the windows during<br />\na quiz. Such interruptions to scholastic pursuits, however, as<br />\nthat of a certain spectacled, puny, stupid Ethiope who broke in<br />\non an English examination to enforce the law\u2014such interruptions are inexcusable.<br />\nThis moral obtuseness on the part of the students is not<br />\nmerely an outgrowth of a general disapproval of rules and regulations. Rather, it indicates clearly the need of some loafing place,<br />\nto be enjoyed by the mass. For those who object to walking<br />\nthrough food, sitting on greasy papers; for any who detest the<br />\nmessiness of spilled milk, melted ice-cream, or for those who lack<br />\nsufficient Hopkins spirit to enthuse over ghastly trophies of the<br />\nvintage of 1900, the loft of the Barn constitutes a sty rather than<br />\na retreat.

Officials of the<br />\nUniversity have spent months in arranging a program which will<br />\nbe impressive and interesting.

Last Monday, however, the members surpassed<br />\nthemselves. They appear as loath to spend money for cups as<br />\nthey were to collect it in the form of fines. In this effort to<br />\nrival the Coolidge administration in economy, all notions of fair<br />\nplay and all sense of obligation seems to have been forgotten.<br />\nA few years ago the Board instituted an Interfraternity baseball tournament. The plan succeeded famously, and the tournament became an annual event. Not least among the factors in<br />\nthe success of the idea was the silver loving cup presented each<br />\nyear to the winning fraternity.<br />\n.Last year when the appointed time had rolled around the<br />\nbaseball games were played as usual. Delta Gamma Theta put<br />\nout a nine which routfd all of Its rivals and won the championship together with a perfectly valid claim to the cup. The trophy,<br />\nhowever, was not forthcoming; the Board, perhaps, was in financial difficulty, having collected only two dollars in fines.<br />\nThe delegates, proverbially open minded, did not want to see<br />\nbaseball<br />\nvictors cheated out of their cup; so last Monday they<br />\nthe<br />\nproceeded to set matters right by voting them out of it in an<br />\neminently legal manner. Since cups are expensive and since<br />\nthe winner of two years ago naturally refused to give up its trophy,<br />\nthe Board, prudent in money matters, wisely decided that, beginning with last year, there should be but one cup, which should<br />\ncirculate from chapter house to chapter house until the end of<br />\ntime.<br />\nIf the ruling were to go into effect this season, it might deserve commendation. But a retroactive ruling which deprives a<br />\nfraternity of a trophy they won honorably is another matter entirely. Sometime ago we spoke of the \"dollar diplomacy\" of the<br />\nInterfraternity Board;'now, it seems, they have shifted their attention to even smaller denominations.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nMAILBAG<br />\nTHOSE GENTLE SOLDIERS<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nCritics of the R. 0.

To call the R. 0. T.<br />\nC. militaristic is patently ridiculous;<br />\non the contrary, the object of the<br />\nmilitary training at this University,<br />\nas expressed by the Hopkins professors of military science and by the<br />\nrepresentative of the Third Corps<br />\nArea at the military exercises last<br />\nspring is to create a strong enough<br />\nreserve force to make aggressive nations chary of attacking the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nFurthermore, it has always been<br />\nthe object of the R. 0. T.

Rather, it indicates clearly the need of some loafing place,<br />\nto be enjoyed by the mass. For those who object to walking<br />\nthrough food, sitting on greasy papers; for any who detest the<br />\nmessiness of spilled milk, melted ice-cream, or for those who lack<br />\nsufficient Hopkins spirit to enthuse over ghastly trophies of the<br />\nvintage of 1900, the loft of the Barn constitutes a sty rather than<br />\na retreat.

Those not caring to<br />\ndance found amusement in several<br />\nrubbers of bridge and other card<br />\ngames.<br />\n* * *<br />\nTwenty-six out of the twentyseven feminine secretaries at Northwestern University have organized<br />\nto combat the fraternities, whom<br />\nthey claim control the campus politics. The young ladies appear to<br />\nbe out for blood.<br />\n* *<br />\nAn edict prohibiting dancing has<br />\nagain been issued at Ohio Northern<br />\nUniversity. Any student who is observed while indulging in such idle<br />\namusement or any student organization, which gives a dance, is threatened with probable expulsion.<br />\n* * *<br />\nThree campus newspapers have<br />\nbeen issued in as many days at the<br />\nUniversity of Manitoba. The trouble started when Leonard L. Knott,<br />\n.the editor of the Manitobian, the official student paper, was asked to resign by the faculty, as a result of<br />\nthe time-worn question of the freedom of the press. A new staff was<br />\nelected to the Manitobian, while<br />\nKnott proceeded to establish a rival paper which he called the Manitoba Student. These two papers<br />\nappeared on successive days, and<br />\non the third day the other publication appeared under the name of the<br />\nRed Herring, which contained libelous reports involving almost every<br />\noutstanding student at the University; and was printed in true fashion on bright red paper. It was finally disclosed that the students responsible were all members of the<br />\nManinew editorial staff of<br />\n_ the<br />\ntoban, who desired an anonymous<br />\ncomeback at Knott, but unhappily<br />\ntried to bite off a good deal more<br />\nthan they were able to masticate.<br />\nNecking parties and \"guzzling\" in<br />\nbootleggers' dives were among the<br />\nlurid accounts enclosed therein. To<br />\ndate libel action has been threatened<br />\nby several students and the matter<br />\nhas been laid in the hands of the<br />\nproper legal authorities.<br />\n* * *<br />\nA rather unique proposal has re cently been made by an alumnus of<br />\nColumbia University.- This loyal<br />\nson has inaugurated a movement to<br />\nhave every alumnus of the institution leave one-tenth of his estate to<br />\nthe University at his death. At<br />\nPresent the movement does not apPear to be progressing very favorably.<br />\n* * *<br />\nPrizes of $500, $300, and $200<br />\nhave been offered by Harper's Magaz:ine for the three best prose manuscripts written by undergraduates<br />\nin any of the American colleges or<br />\nUniversities. Full information concerning the contest may be obtained<br />\nfrom Harper's Magazine, 49 East<br />\n33rd Street, New York City.

So, in the case of Granger Rough<br />\nCut, the plea is that Judge Pipe's verdict<br />\nbe accepted as FINAL!<br />\nTo make a long brief brief: Character<br />\nwitnesses everywhere have sworn to<br />\nGranger's sterling quality. Experts have<br />\nvouched for the superiority of its rough<br />\ncut. Chemists have testified that the new<br />\n\"glassine-sealed\" foil-pouch keeps the<br />\ntobacco in perfect condition.<br />\nFinally, it has been shown that by<br />\nusing this foil-pouch (instead of a costly<br />\ntin) it is possible to sell Granger at just<br />\nten cents. On these arguments Granger<br />\nrests its case! A couple of pipefuls will<br />\nconvince Squire Pipe that it is the world's<br />\ngreatest pipe tobacco . and any good<br />\njudge oftobaccos will confirm the decision!<br /><br />\nR<br />\nRANGE<br />\nCUT<br />\nROUGH<br /><br />\nThe half-pound vacuum tin is forty-five<br />\ncents, the foil-pouch<br />\npackage, sealed in<br />\nglassine, is ten cents.<br /><br />\nfor pipes only!<br /><br />\nGranger Rough Cut is made by the Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, FEBRUARY 18, 1927<br />\nDANCE TO BE HELD<br />\nMONDAY AT BELVEDERE<br />\nDue to a misunderstanding<br />\nwith the Emerson Hotel in regard to the date there will be<br />\nno dance given by the Cotillon<br />\nClub tomorrow night.
