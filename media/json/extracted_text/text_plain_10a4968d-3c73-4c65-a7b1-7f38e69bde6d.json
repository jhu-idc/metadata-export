Namor<br />\n<br />\nStudent housing<br />\nIt is clear now that we have been required to<br />\nflounder about in the Baltimore housing market for far<br />\ntoo long. The University has simply failed to meet its<br />\nresponsibility toward members of its community. And<br />\nno one has been victimized as much by an insensitive<br />\nUniversity and exploitative landlords as the undergraduate. The University, with its financial<br />\nresources and power and legal skill, is quite capable of<br />\nproviding meaningful aid to those who seek city housing.<br />\nBoth the University and students, however, must take<br />\ninto consideration the feelings of the surrounding<br />\ncommunity; there is no place for disgraces like the<br />\nvandalizat'on of fraternity houses by their own members.<br />\nMuch of the difficulty in finding decent student<br />\nhousing stems from the contemporary Middle American<br />\nhatred of youth. But in too many cases, other, more<br />\ntraditional forms of bigotry play a role in denying<br />\nstudents housing. One indication is the three - quarters<br />\ndrop in properties listed with the Outside Housing Office<br />\nsince 1965, when the University decided not to list those<br />\nlandlords who refused to sign a pledge against racial<br />\ndiscrimination. The choice, then, for many students is<br />\neither a drab cubicle in the pathetic upper - class dorms, or some shoddy, high - priced apartment in the<br />\nHomewood area. There is no reason for the choice to be<br />\nso dismal.<br />\nWhat is needed, of course, is a genuine housing<br />\noffice, where complete and accurate rental data would<br />\nbe only the beginning of the University's involvement in<br />\nthe housing problem.liopkins should provide its community full information about our housing rights, and<br />\nprovide legal aid for suits against landlords who<br />\ndiscriminate or violate housing codes. Professional aid<br />\nshould include a community liaison officer who could<br />\nhelp students protect themselves from the housing and<br />\nfood entrepreneurs so adept at the polite theft of student<br />\nmoney. Students, quite willing to picket and bocott for<br />\nothers, are strangely vulnerable in their own lives,<br />\nreluctant to use the weapons of protest for their own<br />\npersonal benefit.<br />\nYet even more important is the need for additional<br />\ndecent housing in the area, which can be gained by the<br />\njudicious purchase of housing properties that are either<br />\nin good condition or are amenable to renovation.<br />\nWithout dislocating the elderly residents of the area, it<br />\nshould be possible to make wise acquisitions that could<br />\nease the housing shortage, as well as provide for a<br />\ncloser - knit Homewood community.<br />\n<br />\nthe news-letter is published twice each week daring the school<br />\nyear by the students of the johns hopkins university, homewood<br />\ncampus, baltimore, maryland. editorial and business correspondence should be addressed to box 1230, the johns hopkins university, baltimore, 21218; telephone 301-366-3300, extension 1308.<br />\nsubscriptions $8 per annum. member, columbia scholastic press<br />\nassociation.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nMORE LIES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSeveral corrections need to<br />\nbe made to clear out wrong<br />\nimpressions given in the<br />\narticle on charter flights in<br />\nthe last News-Letter.

I am<br />\nmaking this information<br />\navailable to interested<br />\nstudents. I believe nobody<br />\nwho once took a charter flight<br />\nand had trouble getting access to the information would<br />\nobject to that.

We will have a new<br />\nundergraduate Dean, a new Provost and<br />\nabove all, a new President - all of whom are<br />\nanxious to work with undergraduates. Dr.<br />\nEisenhower called on all of us in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to do our share. We, the undergraduates, must respond to that call. We<br />\nmust all join in and work together.<br />\nThis past year several events have occurred to enhance the position of undergraduates. The TAC and Undergraduate<br />\nHearings established lines of communication with faculty and administration<br />\npreviously unavailable to the undergraduates.

Dobie Gillis...rte.)<br />\n<br />\n\"Dean\" Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry<br />\nToday let us pay tribute to the most overworked and underappreciated figure on campus. I refer of course to the Dean.<br />\nThe Dean (from the Latin dcancrc\u2014to disembowel) is not, as<br />\nmost of you seem to think, a kind of academic policeman. True,<br />\nhe does administer discipline sometimes, but more often he administers kindness, understanding and simple human goodness. The<br />\nDean (from the Greek dcanos\u2014to rend) is much more than a rule<br />\nenforcer; he is also guide and oracle, shepherd and seer, proconsul and pal. The Dean (from the German dcangcmacht\u2014to poop<br />\na party) is available day and night to students with problems. His<br />\nhours are long, his free time practically nonexistent. Therefore,<br />\non those rare occasions when he does manage to get a few minutes<br />\nto relax, he does it in the best possible way, which means of course<br />\nhe sits down and stretches his legs and pours himself a glass of<br />\nMiller High Life Beer.<br />\n<br />\nDISTRIBUTING CREDIT CARD<br />\nAPPLICATIONS ON CAMPUS<br />\n<br />\nHARLEY'S<br />\n<br />\nPLEASE CALL MR.

Because Miller High Life, as every<br />\nthinking American knows, is the perfect beer to refresh and<br />\nrestore. It is a haven to the harried, a shelter to the spent, a buoy<br />\nto the beat, a boon to the bent, a bolster to the bedraggled, a pillow<br />\nto the pooped. Try it yourself the next time you get weary and sick<br />\nof trying and tired of living and scared of dying. You'll find it<br />\ngratifyingly true what the kindly, decent folks who make Miller<br />\nBeer keep telling us:.\"1/ you've got thc time, we've got the beer.\"<br />\nBut I digress. We were paying tribute to that selfless, shining<br />\npersonage, the Dean. We do not begin to appreciate how hard he<br />\nworks, how hideously complex the problems he solves each day.<br />\nTake, for example, these typical cases from the files of Dean<br />\nat the University of Y<br />\n(If you promise not to<br />\ntell, I'll give you the real names. The Dean is called Sigafoos and<br />\nthe University is Yutah.)<br />\nRecently, the Dean was visited by a freshman named Walter<br />\nAcupuncture who came to ask permission to marry one Emma<br />\nBlenheim, his dormitory laundress. To the Dean the marriage<br />\nseemed ill-advised, for Walter was 18 years of age and Emma was<br />\n94, and rarely do these May-September romances work out.<br />\nAfter a frank, man-to-man talk, the Dean persuaded Walter<br />\nof the folly of his course. Still, Walter felt guilty about jilting<br />\nEmma who had had her garnets polished and bought three new suits<br />\nof underwear in anticipation of the honeymoon. The Dean suggested that Walter send her a handsome gift to soothe her feelings, and Walter did. He sent Emma a nice kidney machine, and<br />\nthey are good friends to this day.<br />\nFreed from his misalliance with Emma, Walter soon found<br />\na girl much nearer his own age\u2014Agnes Yucca, 74. Today they are<br />\nhappily married and Walter is the proud father\u2014step-father,<br />\nactually\u2014of three fine bouncing boys from Agnes's first marriage\u2014<br />\nEverett, 38; Willem, 43; and Rex, 55. Believe me, when Walter<br />\nputs the boys in their little velvet suits and takes them out in the<br />\nperambulator on Sunday afternoons, there is not a dry eye in<br />\nall Yutah.<br />\nBut kindness and understanding don't always work. Sometimes the Dean has no choice but to be firm. Take, for instance,<br />\nthe case of Baxter Mackadangdang.<br />\nBaxter, an exchange student from Polynesia, grew up in the<br />\nidyllic South Sea Isle of Goona-Goona where the leading social<br />\nevent of the year was the feast of Max, the Sun God. A quaint<br />\nall-day ceremony was held, with tribal dancing, war chants, fat<br />\nlady races, pie-eating contests, and, for the grand finale, the<br />\nsacrifice of eleven dozen virgins.<br />\nThus, according to Baxter's folkways, sacrificing virgins was<br />\nperfectly acceptable, but when he became an exchange student he<br />\nsoon learned that Americans take a dim view of this custom, in<br />\nYutah, at any rate. The first twelve or thirteen times Baxter<br />\nsacrificed a virgin, the Dean let him off with a warning. When,<br />\nhowever, Baxter persisted, the Dean was forced to impose a heavy<br />\npenalty: he cancelled Baxter's parking permit.<br />\nA broken man, Baxter quit school and returned to GoonaGoona where today he scratches out a meager living selling forged<br />\nautographs of Joseph Conrad.<br />\nThis column is brought to you weekly by the brewers of Miller<br />\nHigh Life Beer who are otherwise rational men.<br />\n<br />\nLAST CHANCE (NO JOKE)<br />\n5th Annual Hopkins Group *<br />\nfrom Baltimore<br />\nrnd.<br />\nfor dates-call 467-2874<br />\n$238 trip<br />\n5 seats left<br />\n* on regular-not charter-airline<br />\n<br />\nCALL 467-2874<br />\n<br />\nEUROPE<br />\n<br />\nDON'T GET STUCK PAYING EXTRA \u2014<br />\n1.

With what time<br />\nremains, he attends to the<br />\nnumerous and assorted injuries afflicting Hopkins<br />\nprofessors, administrators,<br />\nstudents, local club lacrosse<br />\nplayers, and even some<br />\nBaltimore Olympic Club<br />\npeople.<br />\nNo' man could conceivably<br />\ndo all this by himself.

Now, Brandy<br />\ndoes as much for the sprained<br />\nankle or pulled muscle of the<br />\ntrack and field man as he<br />\ndoes for the same injury to a<br />\nlacrosse player.<br />\nTo be sure, more injuries<br />\noccur in lacrosse, which is,<br />\nafter all, a contact sport.<br />\nBrandy, in fact, travels with<br />\nthe team. During games, be<br />\nthey home or away, he is to be<br />\nfound right around the<br />\nHopkins bench.<br />\nWhen he's not at lacrosse<br />\ngames or socializing at<br />\nHopkins fraternity parties,<br />\nBrandy can be found in the<br />\ntraining room. Often he is<br />\nthere early in the morning to<br />\ngive treatment or do a tape<br />\njob for athletes who must<br />\nboard a bus for an away<br />\ncontest hours before competition.<br />\n<br />\nA trainer, of course, could<br />\neasily overlook the athlete's<br />\noverall welfare. He could<br />\nconsider winning more important. Brandy, however,<br />\nadvises an athlete not to<br />\nparticipate in a game, meet,<br />\nor match if he believes there<br />\nis a likelihood that the athlete<br />\nwill aggravate an injury he is<br />\nreceiving treatment for.<br />\nOf course, Brandy is not a<br />\nsaint. Ile occasionally loses<br />\nhis patience and unlooses his<br />\nNavy vocabulary on Hopkins<br />\ncoaches, student trainers,<br />\nand opposing team players<br />\ninvading his fortress.<br />\nMost often, though, Brandy<br />\njust does his job quietly and<br />\nthe results of his handiwork<br />\noften go unseen.

Namor<br /><br />\nStudent housing<br />\nIt is clear now that we have been required to<br />\nflounder about in the Baltimore housing market for far<br />\ntoo long. The University has simply failed to meet its<br />\nresponsibility toward members of its community. And<br />\nno one has been victimized as much by an insensitive<br />\nUniversity and exploitative landlords as the undergraduate. The University, with its financial<br />\nresources and power and legal skill, is quite capable of<br />\nproviding meaningful aid to those who seek city housing.<br />\nBoth the University and students, however, must take<br />\ninto consideration the feelings of the surrounding<br />\ncommunity; there is no place for disgraces like the<br />\nvandalizat'on of fraternity houses by their own members.<br />\nMuch of the difficulty in finding decent student<br />\nhousing stems from the contemporary Middle American<br />\nhatred of youth. But in too many cases, other, more<br />\ntraditional forms of bigotry play a role in denying<br />\nstudents housing. One indication is the three - quarters<br />\ndrop in properties listed with the Outside Housing Office<br />\nsince 1965, when the University decided not to list those<br />\nlandlords who refused to sign a pledge against racial<br />\ndiscrimination. The choice, then, for many students is<br />\neither a drab cubicle in the pathetic upper - class dorms, or some shoddy, high - priced apartment in the<br />\nHomewood area.

We will have a new<br />\nundergraduate Dean, a new Provost and<br />\nabove all, a new President - all of whom are<br />\nanxious to work with undergraduates. Dr.<br />\nEisenhower called on all of us in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to do our share. We, the undergraduates, must respond to that call. We<br />\nmust all join in and work together.<br />\nThis past year several events have occurred to enhance the position of undergraduates. The TAC and Undergraduate<br />\nHearings established lines of communication with faculty and administration<br />\npreviously unavailable to the undergraduates.

Dobie Gillis...rte.)<br /><br />\n\"Dean\" Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry<br />\nToday let us pay tribute to the most overworked and underappreciated figure on campus. I refer of course to the Dean.<br />\nThe Dean (from the Latin dcancrc\u2014to disembowel) is not, as<br />\nmost of you seem to think, a kind of academic policeman. True,<br />\nhe does administer discipline sometimes, but more often he administers kindness, understanding and simple human goodness. The<br />\nDean (from the Greek dcanos\u2014to rend) is much more than a rule<br />\nenforcer; he is also guide and oracle, shepherd and seer, proconsul and pal. The Dean (from the German dcangcmacht\u2014to poop<br />\na party) is available day and night to students with problems. His<br />\nhours are long, his free time practically nonexistent. Therefore,<br />\non those rare occasions when he does manage to get a few minutes<br />\nto relax, he does it in the best possible way, which means of course<br />\nhe sits down and stretches his legs and pours himself a glass of<br />\nMiller High Life Beer.<br /><br />\nDISTRIBUTING CREDIT CARD<br />\nAPPLICATIONS ON CAMPUS<br /><br />\nHARLEY'S<br /><br />\nPLEASE CALL MR.

Because Miller High Life, as every<br />\nthinking American knows, is the perfect beer to refresh and<br />\nrestore. It is a haven to the harried, a shelter to the spent, a buoy<br />\nto the beat, a boon to the bent, a bolster to the bedraggled, a pillow<br />\nto the pooped. Try it yourself the next time you get weary and sick<br />\nof trying and tired of living and scared of dying. You'll find it<br />\ngratifyingly true what the kindly, decent folks who make Miller<br />\nBeer keep telling us:.\"1/ you've got thc time, we've got the beer.\"<br />\nBut I digress. We were paying tribute to that selfless, shining<br />\npersonage, the Dean. We do not begin to appreciate how hard he<br />\nworks, how hideously complex the problems he solves each day.<br />\nTake, for example, these typical cases from the files of Dean<br />\nat the University of Y<br />\n(If you promise not to<br />\ntell, I'll give you the real names. The Dean is called Sigafoos and<br />\nthe University is Yutah.)<br />\nRecently, the Dean was visited by a freshman named Walter<br />\nAcupuncture who came to ask permission to marry one Emma<br />\nBlenheim, his dormitory laundress. To the Dean the marriage<br />\nseemed ill-advised, for Walter was 18 years of age and Emma was<br />\n94, and rarely do these May-September romances work out.<br />\nAfter a frank, man-to-man talk, the Dean persuaded Walter<br />\nof the folly of his course. Still, Walter felt guilty about jilting<br />\nEmma who had had her garnets polished and bought three new suits<br />\nof underwear in anticipation of the honeymoon. The Dean suggested that Walter send her a handsome gift to soothe her feelings, and Walter did. He sent Emma a nice kidney machine, and<br />\nthey are good friends to this day.<br />\nFreed from his misalliance with Emma, Walter soon found<br />\na girl much nearer his own age\u2014Agnes Yucca, 74. Today they are<br />\nhappily married and Walter is the proud father\u2014step-father,<br />\nactually\u2014of three fine bouncing boys from Agnes's first marriage\u2014<br />\nEverett, 38; Willem, 43; and Rex, 55. Believe me, when Walter<br />\nputs the boys in their little velvet suits and takes them out in the<br />\nperambulator on Sunday afternoons, there is not a dry eye in<br />\nall Yutah.<br />\nBut kindness and understanding don't always work. Sometimes the Dean has no choice but to be firm. Take, for instance,<br />\nthe case of Baxter Mackadangdang.<br />\nBaxter, an exchange student from Polynesia, grew up in the<br />\nidyllic South Sea Isle of Goona-Goona where the leading social<br />\nevent of the year was the feast of Max, the Sun God. A quaint<br />\nall-day ceremony was held, with tribal dancing, war chants, fat<br />\nlady races, pie-eating contests, and, for the grand finale, the<br />\nsacrifice of eleven dozen virgins.<br />\nThus, according to Baxter's folkways, sacrificing virgins was<br />\nperfectly acceptable, but when he became an exchange student he<br />\nsoon learned that Americans take a dim view of this custom, in<br />\nYutah, at any rate. The first twelve or thirteen times Baxter<br />\nsacrificed a virgin, the Dean let him off with a warning. When,<br />\nhowever, Baxter persisted, the Dean was forced to impose a heavy<br />\npenalty: he cancelled Baxter's parking permit.<br />\nA broken man, Baxter quit school and returned to GoonaGoona where today he scratches out a meager living selling forged<br />\nautographs of Joseph Conrad.<br />\nThis column is brought to you weekly by the brewers of Miller<br />\nHigh Life Beer who are otherwise rational men.<br /><br />\nLAST CHANCE (NO JOKE)<br />\n5th Annual Hopkins Group *<br />\nfrom Baltimore<br />\nrnd.<br />\nfor dates-call 467-2874<br />\n$238 trip<br />\n5 seats left<br />\n* on regular-not charter-airline<br /><br />\nCALL 467-2874<br /><br />\nEUROPE<br /><br />\nDON'T GET STUCK PAYING EXTRA \u2014<br />\n1.

White Athletic<br />\nCenter lies a neatly stencilled<br />\nname plate that reads L.R.J.<br />\nBrandimore.<br />\nTo<br />\nmost<br />\nHopkins athletes, the man<br />\nwho occasionally sits behind<br />\nthat desk is very familiar.<br />\n\"Brandy,\" as he is called,<br />\nis Hopkins' full-time trainer.<br />\nA many-year veteran of the<br />\nNavy before coming to<br />\nHopkins, Brandy has as his<br />\nfirst priority mending the<br />\ninjured wings of Blue Jay<br />\nathletes. With what time<br />\nremains, he attends to the<br />\nnumerous and assorted injuries afflicting Hopkins<br />\nprofessors, administrators,<br />\nstudents, local club lacrosse<br />\nplayers, and even some<br />\nBaltimore Olympic Club<br />\npeople.<br />\nNo' man could conceivably<br />\ndo all this by himself. And so,<br />\nBrandy is assisted by several<br />\npart-time student trainers,<br />\nhalf of whose tuition is picked<br />\nup by the University in return<br />\nfor a \"maximum\" twenty<br />\nhour work week. \"They may<br />\nbe supposed to work twenty<br />\nhours here a week, but they<br />\noften put in much more,\"<br /><br />\nWJHU<br /><br />\nqualifies Brandimore.<br />\nEnds Torture<br /><br />\nThose who spend even a<br />\nlittle time in the training<br />\nroom during the spring know<br />\nthat Brandy provides personal treatment for all<br />\nathletes, regardless of sport.<br />\nIn pre-Brandy days, a nonlacrosse player could barely<br />\nwedge his way into the<br />\ntraining room. Now, Brandy<br />\ndoes as much for the sprained<br />\nankle or pulled muscle of the<br />\ntrack and field man as he<br />\ndoes for the same injury to a<br />\nlacrosse player.<br />\nTo be sure, more injuries<br />\noccur in lacrosse, which is,<br />\nafter all, a contact sport.<br />\nBrandy, in fact, travels with<br />\nthe team. During games, be<br />\nthey home or away, he is to be<br />\nfound right around the<br />\nHopkins bench.<br />\nWhen he's not at lacrosse<br />\ngames or socializing at<br />\nHopkins fraternity parties,<br />\nBrandy can be found in the<br />\ntraining room. Often he is<br />\nthere early in the morning to<br />\ngive treatment or do a tape<br />\njob for athletes who must<br />\nboard a bus for an away<br />\ncontest hours before competition.<br /><br />\nA trainer, of course, could<br />\neasily overlook the athlete's<br />\noverall welfare. He could<br />\nconsider winning more important. Brandy, however,<br />\nadvises an athlete not to<br />\nparticipate in a game, meet,<br />\nor match if he believes there<br />\nis a likelihood that the athlete<br />\nwill aggravate an injury he is<br />\nreceiving treatment for.<br />\nOf course, Brandy is not a<br />\nsaint. Ile occasionally loses<br />\nhis patience and unlooses his<br />\nNavy vocabulary on Hopkins<br />\ncoaches, student trainers,<br />\nand opposing team players<br />\ninvading his fortress.<br />\nMost often, though, Brandy<br />\njust does his job quietly and<br />\nthe results of his handiwork<br />\noften go unseen.
