In order to determine the sentiment of alumni and friends of the<br />\ncollege on this question, a questionnaire has been presented; the<br />\nsame means have been adopted at<br />\nthe 'University of Haverford. The<br />\nhistory of the Haverford-Swarthmore football question is extremely<br />\ninteresting: the first game was held<br />\nin 1879, but due to the unpopularity<br />\nof the sport, no contest was again<br />\nheld until 1884. From then until<br />\n1904, with the exception of 1896<br />\nwhen the game was cancelled because o fthe death of a Swarthmore<br />\nplayer the football contest was an<br />\nannual event. A change in Swarthmore's policy of \"good feeling and<br />\nkind treatment,\" according to the<br />\nHaverford News, resulted in a severance of relations. An attempt was<br />\nmade to heal the break, resulting in<br />\nthe establishment of the Haverford<br />\nNews as a means of resuming relations. The result was favorable, and<br />\nthe contest continued to be an annual event until 1925 when relations<br />\nwere again severed because Haverford authorities declared that \"It<br />\nis unwise to close the season with a<br />\ncollege whose widely differing athletic policies produce a condition of<br />\ninequality in football competition.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "HOPKINS STICKMEN<br />\nTO MEET OLYMPICS<br /><br />\nPrice 5 Cents<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 27, 1930<br /><br />\nVOL.

In order to determine the sentiment of alumni and friends of the<br />\ncollege on this question, a questionnaire has been presented; the<br />\nsame means have been adopted at<br />\nthe 'University of Haverford. The<br />\nhistory of the Haverford-Swarthmore football question is extremely<br />\ninteresting: the first game was held<br />\nin 1879, but due to the unpopularity<br />\nof the sport, no contest was again<br />\nheld until 1884. From then until<br />\n1904, with the exception of 1896<br />\nwhen the game was cancelled because o fthe death of a Swarthmore<br />\nplayer the football contest was an<br />\nannual event. A change in Swarthmore's policy of \"good feeling and<br />\nkind treatment,\" according to the<br />\nHaverford News, resulted in a severance of relations. An attempt was<br />\nmade to heal the break, resulting in<br />\nthe establishment of the Haverford<br />\nNews as a means of resuming relations. The result was favorable, and<br />\nthe contest continued to be an annual event until 1925 when relations<br />\nwere again severed because Haverford authorities declared that \"It<br />\nis unwise to close the season with a<br />\ncollege whose widely differing athletic policies produce a condition of<br />\ninequality in football competition.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 38464, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "6fb0bd3e-c089-4d80-a406-87b52fde9c5e", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12141-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12141, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "e9aa6178-62b5-4953-86cb-549f5d16d99f", "url": "/node/12141"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "6b80be7c-d387-4c1d-9323-bc3ff600f9ab"}]}
