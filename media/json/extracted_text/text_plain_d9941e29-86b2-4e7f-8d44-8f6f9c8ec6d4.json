So, in deference to this imaginary injunction,<br />\nwe restrain ourselves with heroic efforts from gloating over another development in the Student Activities Council's already acute case of mental and motor<br />\nataxia.<br />\nSeveral weeks ago we threw discretion to the<br />\nwinds and ventured to predict that if the S. A. C.<br />\ndidn't do something about its condition immediately<br />\nthere would be a constant recession of its powers and<br />\nusefulness to the point of absolute insignificance. At<br />\nthe present writing, we find the campus activities in<br />\none of the most straitened situations they have ever<br />\nfaced. With a tremendous debt left from last year<br />\nbecause of the bank failure, and with an acute need<br />\nfor operating funds because of general business conditions, the funds available for work do not meet<br />\neven 50 per cent of the requirements.<br />\nThis case is not unusual among businesses. But<br />\nwhat is striking about the affair is that the S. A. C.<br />\nhas done positively nothing since the University<br />\nopened. Not once has the word \"budget\" received<br />\nattention from the assembled Council. During the<br />\nlast two weeks, when developments have come fast<br />\nand furiously and when altercations between activities and administration have been numerous, the Council hasn't met at all, even on the excuse of adding new<br />\nmembers or revising the constitution.<br />\nThese facts constitute a rather imposing refutation<br />\nof the Council's argument that it is a place of profitable discussion; an incubator, as 'twere, of cooperative spirit. When has the cause of student interests<br />\never required a more united front and stronger championing than at the present? The authorities collect<br />\nthe fees, take out whatever the University thinks<br />\nbest, pay off the debts, re-apportion the budgets, and<br />\n_give us the money when it so suits them.

The students figure not at all.<br />\nOf course, if the Council really did meet about<br />\nthis, all it could do would be to wax indignant\u2014<br />\na perfect subversion of all further student interests.<br />\nThe real effectiveness of the activities has been in the<br />\nactions of their own leaders who have gone to the<br />\n<br />\nDean and President wholly on their own initiative.<br />\nIf the authorities have been at all diverted from their<br />\noriginal designs of running the show regardless, it<br />\nhas been through the individual efforts of these activities heads. Just picture the Dean's office, for instance, being at all perturbed by an indignant resolution from the Council! Experience has taught us<br />\nbetter.<br />\nThis brings us back to our first proposition, advanced early in the year: provide a single activities<br />\nman, equivalent to the present S. A. C. president, who<br />\nwill act as a sort of \"Commissioner of Activities\".<br />\nMatters that concern more than one group can be<br />\ntaken up between those groups exclusively, without<br />\noutside interference. Matters requiring faculty attention may be taken up just as they are now\u2014individually by the activities heads. Let the Commissioner<br />\nconduct, with assistants, any necessary investigations.<br />\nMake him a virtual dictator, if you will, holding office<br />\nat the pleasure of the Student Council and activities<br />\nheads.<br />\nBut in the name of decency, bounce this farcial,<br />\ninefficient, useless institution, the Student Activities<br />\nCouncil.<br />\n<br />\nIn Acknowledgement<br />\nLast year we had occasion to point out the need<br />\nexisting for a laboratory in the economics department.<br />\nThe quarters provided for problem work were very<br />\ncramped and were entirely unventilated, lacking windows.<br />\nWhen the fact had been sufficiently emphasized and<br />\nbrought to the attention of the President, he made<br />\narrangements to accommodate the increasing numbers<br />\nof students in economics. We are glad to close a<br />\nchapter in our history with such a favorable event.<br />\nMen working 'in the lab may now, through the<br />\nefforts of self-sacrificing social reformers, spend the<br />\nnormal amount of time in looking out the window,<br />\nbless their hearts!<br />\n<br />\nAt It Again<br />\nThe \"Y\" boys are at it again. Worked up to a<br />\nfever pitch through weeks of anticipation and encouraged by the never-failing Grin, they're riding<br />\nevery mother's son of us in a gallant effort to raise<br />\nfunds to meet the Levering budget for the year. Some<br />\nof the newer men around the University may wonder why Levering should have to canvass the students and not derive its funds through the regular<br />\nendowment and tuition channels. And, if we may<br />\ndigress for a word aside, President Ames is probably<br />\nwondering if Remsen and Rowland Halls couldn't<br />\nrout out their staffs and do the same sort of highclass begging.<br />\nA short explanation will clear up this point. The<br />\nmen are not merely trying to pull over a fast<br />\none on unsuspecting frosh. They are really not an<br />\nintegral part of the University establishment but are<br />\na distinct group known as the Hopkins Y. M. C. A.<br />\nThey must meet their own budgets, pay the interest<br />\non their own mortgage, hire their own help, and take<br />\ncare of all financial obligations of any nature. The<br />\nUniversity does not exercise any jurisdiction over<br />\nMr. Schaal, other than conventional ties, and the<br />\nactivities must secure his permission to use the Hall,<br />\nsince he ig the \"Y\" secretary.<br />\nLevering Hall has fitted into our extra-curricular<br />\nlife so intimately and indispensably that those of us<br />\nwho have been through earlier campaigns for money<br />\nare in perfect sympathy with the cause. In a spirit<br />\nof mutual self-interest we'd like to pass the word<br />\nalong that to support the drive to the best of your<br />\nability is quite \"the thing to do\" and you will not<br />\ncome into derision for having been \"caught\" by<br />\nsmooth talkers. We regard the campaign as affording<br />\nus an opportunity to pay off a little of the debt we<br />\nowe the \"Y\".<br />\n<br />\nFlashes<br />\nBy Millard Langfeld<br />\nDEMOCRATIC DURGE<br />\n<br />\nflew last Thursday in many a polling place<br />\nin old Gotham and the Tammany Tiger took it<br />\non the chin. Amidst an uproar the scope of which<br />\noutprecedents any previous mayoralty disturbance,<br />\nFiorella LaGuardia was catapaulted into office by one<br />\nof the most powerful political battering-rams Manhattan has ever seen.<br />\nHis is a strange personality. Often termed the<br />\n\"Little Flower\" of New York streets, he spent most<br />\nof his boyhood in the west. An avowed Republican,<br />\nhe held office as a Socialist congressman. As American consul, he once defied an Old World princess,<br />\nand was officially spanked by an apologetic State Department. And now he holds a desk which has become the focal point of a great national game.<br />\nFor there was more in the recent battle than was<br />\ndreamt about in the average voter's philosophy. That<br />\nbattle was fought in a larger arena than our twentyfour dollar island in the Hudson, and concerned a<br />\nlarger prize. The Roosevelt regime, in the person of<br />\nthe able Mr. Farley, was attendant in all force. The<br />\nRoosevelt regime played a skillful game, but the deck<br />\nwas cut one too many times.<br />\nIt is true, the smiling lord of Capitol Hill did not<br />\nby personal word or deed enter into the controversy.<br />\nYet the able grand mogul of the Democratic Party<br />\nrushed in with a vengeance. And the White House<br />\ndid not say him nay.<br />\nIt was a worthy stake. Victory for McKee meant<br />\nsurety for Roosevelt in the congressional elections of<br />\n1934. 1936 is another presidential year, not to men-<br />\n<br />\nFISTS<br />\n<br />\ntion the governor's chair at Albany, beckoning to a<br />\ncertain laboring national party chairman. And, last<br />\nbut not least, there would have been thousands of city<br />\njobs for the faithful. Verily, control of New York<br />\nwas a worthy stake.<br />\nBut now the fusionists have it, and to the victor<br />\nbelong the spoils.<br />\nA LITTLE less than a month and the noble experiment will be no more, in name as well as in fact.<br />\nAlthough opposed in the last moment by two of the<br />\ngreatest moonshine states in the country, repeal<br />\nawaits but the formal ceremonies of ratification and<br />\nproclamation to become law.<br />\nIt has been a long and bitter fight. And to both<br />\nsides must be conceded the acclaim which goes with<br />\nsincerity. There were hypocrites a-many to be sure,<br />\nbut the majority of staunch crusaders, no matter<br />\nwhere their convictions lay, were in earnest. And so<br />\nin victory there is tragedy as well as triumph.<br />\nBut now comes the real test. The people of the<br />\nnation have spoken. It now stands to be seen if<br />\nthose who fell before their verdict can take as well as<br />\ngive. It now stands to be seen if they will join the<br />\ntide of progress, aid in the enactment of sane and not<br />\nfanatical liquor legislation, and turn their funds and<br />\ntalents to more pressing issues in the pending national<br />\nand international hour of need. Or if they will continue in stiff-necked and futile defiance of the popular<br />\nwill, and earn contempt instead of the respectful admiration which is the consolation cup of all who have<br />\nfought a good fight and with conviction.<br />\n<br />\nCampus Brevities<br />\nThe Battle of the Century took<br />\nplace in Levering the other day.

In connection with the so-called<br />\n\"dirty\" politics in fraternity matters, the recent Alpha Tau Omega<br />\naffair came up.

So, in deference to this imaginary injunction,<br />\nwe restrain ourselves with heroic efforts from gloating over another development in the Student Activities Council's already acute case of mental and motor<br />\nataxia.<br />\nSeveral weeks ago we threw discretion to the<br />\nwinds and ventured to predict that if the S. A. C.<br />\ndidn't do something about its condition immediately<br />\nthere would be a constant recession of its powers and<br />\nusefulness to the point of absolute insignificance. At<br />\nthe present writing, we find the campus activities in<br />\none of the most straitened situations they have ever<br />\nfaced. With a tremendous debt left from last year<br />\nbecause of the bank failure, and with an acute need<br />\nfor operating funds because of general business conditions, the funds available for work do not meet<br />\neven 50 per cent of the requirements.<br />\nThis case is not unusual among businesses. But<br />\nwhat is striking about the affair is that the S. A. C.<br />\nhas done positively nothing since the University<br />\nopened. Not once has the word \"budget\" received<br />\nattention from the assembled Council. During the<br />\nlast two weeks, when developments have come fast<br />\nand furiously and when altercations between activities and administration have been numerous, the Council hasn't met at all, even on the excuse of adding new<br />\nmembers or revising the constitution.<br />\nThese facts constitute a rather imposing refutation<br />\nof the Council's argument that it is a place of profitable discussion; an incubator, as 'twere, of cooperative spirit. When has the cause of student interests<br />\never required a more united front and stronger championing than at the present? The authorities collect<br />\nthe fees, take out whatever the University thinks<br />\nbest, pay off the debts, re-apportion the budgets, and<br />\n_give us the money when it so suits them. Note,<br />\nthe authorities do this. The students figure not at all.<br />\nOf course, if the Council really did meet about<br />\nthis, all it could do would be to wax indignant\u2014<br />\na perfect subversion of all further student interests.<br />\nThe real effectiveness of the activities has been in the<br />\nactions of their own leaders who have gone to the<br /><br />\nDean and President wholly on their own initiative.<br />\nIf the authorities have been at all diverted from their<br />\noriginal designs of running the show regardless, it<br />\nhas been through the individual efforts of these activities heads. Just picture the Dean's office, for instance, being at all perturbed by an indignant resolution from the Council! Experience has taught us<br />\nbetter.<br />\nThis brings us back to our first proposition, advanced early in the year: provide a single activities<br />\nman, equivalent to the present S. A. C. president, who<br />\nwill act as a sort of \"Commissioner of Activities\".<br />\nMatters that concern more than one group can be<br />\ntaken up between those groups exclusively, without<br />\noutside interference. Matters requiring faculty attention may be taken up just as they are now\u2014individually by the activities heads. Let the Commissioner<br />\nconduct, with assistants, any necessary investigations.<br />\nMake him a virtual dictator, if you will, holding office<br />\nat the pleasure of the Student Council and activities<br />\nheads.<br />\nBut in the name of decency, bounce this farcial,<br />\ninefficient, useless institution, the Student Activities<br />\nCouncil.<br /><br />\nIn Acknowledgement<br />\nLast year we had occasion to point out the need<br />\nexisting for a laboratory in the economics department.<br />\nThe quarters provided for problem work were very<br />\ncramped and were entirely unventilated, lacking windows.<br />\nWhen the fact had been sufficiently emphasized and<br />\nbrought to the attention of the President, he made<br />\narrangements to accommodate the increasing numbers<br />\nof students in economics. We are glad to close a<br />\nchapter in our history with such a favorable event.<br />\nMen working 'in the lab may now, through the<br />\nefforts of self-sacrificing social reformers, spend the<br />\nnormal amount of time in looking out the window,<br />\nbless their hearts!<br /><br />\nAt It Again<br />\nThe \"Y\" boys are at it again. Worked up to a<br />\nfever pitch through weeks of anticipation and encouraged by the never-failing Grin, they're riding<br />\nevery mother's son of us in a gallant effort to raise<br />\nfunds to meet the Levering budget for the year. Some<br />\nof the newer men around the University may wonder why Levering should have to canvass the students and not derive its funds through the regular<br />\nendowment and tuition channels. And, if we may<br />\ndigress for a word aside, President Ames is probably<br />\nwondering if Remsen and Rowland Halls couldn't<br />\nrout out their staffs and do the same sort of highclass begging.<br />\nA short explanation will clear up this point. The<br />\nmen are not merely trying to pull over a fast<br />\none on unsuspecting frosh. They are really not an<br />\nintegral part of the University establishment but are<br />\na distinct group known as the Hopkins Y. M. C. A.<br />\nThey must meet their own budgets, pay the interest<br />\non their own mortgage, hire their own help, and take<br />\ncare of all financial obligations of any nature. The<br />\nUniversity does not exercise any jurisdiction over<br />\nMr. Schaal, other than conventional ties, and the<br />\nactivities must secure his permission to use the Hall,<br />\nsince he ig the \"Y\" secretary.<br />\nLevering Hall has fitted into our extra-curricular<br />\nlife so intimately and indispensably that those of us<br />\nwho have been through earlier campaigns for money<br />\nare in perfect sympathy with the cause. In a spirit<br />\nof mutual self-interest we'd like to pass the word<br />\nalong that to support the drive to the best of your<br />\nability is quite \"the thing to do\" and you will not<br />\ncome into derision for having been \"caught\" by<br />\nsmooth talkers. We regard the campaign as affording<br />\nus an opportunity to pay off a little of the debt we<br />\nowe the \"Y\".<br /><br />\nFlashes<br />\nBy Millard Langfeld<br />\nDEMOCRATIC DURGE<br /><br />\nflew last Thursday in many a polling place<br />\nin old Gotham and the Tammany Tiger took it<br />\non the chin. Amidst an uproar the scope of which<br />\noutprecedents any previous mayoralty disturbance,<br />\nFiorella LaGuardia was catapaulted into office by one<br />\nof the most powerful political battering-rams Manhattan has ever seen.<br />\nHis is a strange personality. Often termed the<br />\n\"Little Flower\" of New York streets, he spent most<br />\nof his boyhood in the west. An avowed Republican,<br />\nhe held office as a Socialist congressman. As American consul, he once defied an Old World princess,<br />\nand was officially spanked by an apologetic State Department. And now he holds a desk which has become the focal point of a great national game.<br />\nFor there was more in the recent battle than was<br />\ndreamt about in the average voter's philosophy. That<br />\nbattle was fought in a larger arena than our twentyfour dollar island in the Hudson, and concerned a<br />\nlarger prize. The Roosevelt regime, in the person of<br />\nthe able Mr. Farley, was attendant in all force. The<br />\nRoosevelt regime played a skillful game, but the deck<br />\nwas cut one too many times.<br />\nIt is true, the smiling lord of Capitol Hill did not<br />\nby personal word or deed enter into the controversy.<br />\nYet the able grand mogul of the Democratic Party<br />\nrushed in with a vengeance. And the White House<br />\ndid not say him nay.<br />\nIt was a worthy stake.

But, it<br />\nwas pointed out in reply, there can<br />\nbe no comparison between high<br /><br />\nschool and college fraternities, as<br />\nthe men of the latter are older and<br />\nare of more responsible nature.<br />\nThe intricacies of fraternity politics were then explained: \"clean\"<br />\npolitics, in which the fraternity's<br />\nmembers work for the welfare of<br />\nall, and \"dirty\" politics, in which the<br />\nmembers use unfair means to increase their own particular prosperity. In connection with the so-called<br />\n\"dirty\" politics in fraternity matters, the recent Alpha Tau Omega<br />\naffair came up.
