Brubeck Quartette<br />\nTakes Five Too Many<br />\nBy PETER ONUF<br />\nHippies and pseudo-Hippies<br />\nthink a lot of different things<br />\nabout Brubeck. Hoppies, however, who made the Big Weekend Scene at Shriver were unanimous, if not in enthusiasm,<br />\nat least in trying to be enthusiastic. Tweedy old men tapped<br />\ntheir feet and smiled tentatively<br />\nat tweedy old ladies; Hopkins<br />\nmen and girls knew that this<br />\nwas the real thing. During the<br />\ncourse of the evening, the audience ranged from warm to hot<br />\nIn responsiveness and personal<br />\ncomfort, respectively. The Quartette blew cool and cold. If<br />\nanyone, Desmond was particularly disappointing\u2014he played<br />\nprettily on a couple of ballads,<br />\nbut generally wasn't interested\u2014<br />\nthe way he folds his hands over<br />\nhis axe is cool, however, if nothing else. He only got half worked-up over his own \"Take Five,\"<br />\nand fared only passably on another one of his standard solos<br />\nin \"Three to Get Ready.\" His<br />\nbest moments featured Gene<br />\nWright's steady and always rewarding basswork. Wright, in<br />\nfact, even seemed to be enjoying<br />\nhimself. Morello, however, is<br />\nconstitutionally unable to smile;<br />\nhe outcooled even Desmond, who<br />\ndespite his apathy showed an<br />\noccasional sparkle of humanity.<br />\nThe drummer knew he was good<br />\nand, like a true concert favorite,<br />\nknew how to get laughs and<br />\nnoise from the audience. Brubeck himself is hard to figure.<br />\nHippies generally write him off.<br />\nHe is certainly no Monk, nor is<br />\n- he a Bill Evans, but he does have<br />\nprofessional polish and an intelligent approach. If anyone cared,<br />\nhe did and most of the musically exciting moments of the<br />\nevening were during his solos\u2014<br />\nsome of this excitement was<br />\nnoise, some polyrhythmic virtuosity, and some, again, simple<br />\nIntelligence. There seemed to be<br />\nlittle rapport, however, between<br />\nDesmond and Brubeck, and the<br />\nQuartette to be at its best depends on this. Brubeck was at<br />\nhome with his rhythm, though,<br />\nand if the swing passages could<br />\nbe redeemed from Desmond's<br />\ntepid interpretations, Brubeck<br />\nwas able to do it.<br />\nAmong the numbers performed<br />\nwas a bit of church jazz, \"40<br />\nDays,\" which, if anything, was<br />\na vehicle for some of the better<br />\nsolos of the evening.

During the<br />\nnext four years, all too few of<br />\nthem ever return.<br />\nAt present, there are three extraordinary exhibits less than a<br />\nfive-minute walk from Levering.<br />\nThey range from Renaissance<br />\nJewels through Japanese photographs to pop and op art.<br />\n\"Pop and Op,\" an exhibition of<br />\n65 graphic works circulating<br />\nthroughout the country by the<br />\nAmerican Federation of Art, includes such contemporary<br />\n\"greats\" as Andy Warhol, Roy<br />\nLichtenstein, John Wesley and<br />\nEllsworth Kelly.<br />\nThe exhibit is rather more fun<br />\nthan stimulating or exciting. It is<br />\nall as would be expected: the op<br />\ndizzies, the pop is good old camp<br />\n(thank god Batman is excluded).<br />\nEven more exciting is the exhibition of works by three Japanese<br />\nphotographers, Hiroshi<br />\nHamaya, Koyo<br />\nOkada<br />\nand<br />\nTokutaro Tanaka. The exhibit<br />\ndemonstrates well what artistic<br />\nheights photography can achieve.<br />\nIn Japanese artistic tradition,<br />\nthe photographers concentrate on<br />\nparticular themes through a sequence of photographs in which<br />\nthey translate their perceptions<br />\nof nature and man into a feeling<br />\nand sensitive whole.<br />\nOkada, who has spent 50 years<br />\n<br />\nphotographing Mt. Fuji, captures<br />\nwell the many and changing faces<br />\nof the mountain in various angles and weather conditions. The<br />\nsubject is the same, but the photographs differ greatly in theme<br />\nand feeling.<br />\nTanaka's photographs of the<br />\nwhite egret, a beautiful and<br />\ngraceful bird, are filled with<br />\nechoes of Japanese brush painting. He uses twigs, plants and<br />\nangular structures to show the<br />\nsymmetry of the bird on a perch<br />\nand in flight.<br />\nHamaya captures the drudgery<br />\nand hardships of peasant life on<br />\nthe backcoast of Japan, especially in times of bad weather. It is<br />\na life of constant struggle with<br />\nthe natural elements of life.<br />\nThe latest exhibit to arrive at<br />\nthe museum is the Melvin Gutman Collection of Renaissance<br />\njewels in the recently completed<br />\nRenaissance Room of the Decorative Arts Gallery.<br />\nThe exhibit includes over 200<br />\njewels and jeweled objects de<br />\nvertue from all over Europe and<br />\nRussia which were made between<br />\nthe late 1400's and 1700. Most are<br />\nof gold, a few of silver, amber,<br />\npearl and ivory.<br />\nThe greatest tribute to the artistic taste of the museum exhibitors is the room itself, a mahagony panelled 17th century<br />\nroom transported from England<br />\nincluding authentic Renaissance<br />\nfurniture, statuary, and stained<br />\nglass windows.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and oh!, try:<br />\n<br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest Italian food in town<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br />\nCALL 889-3831<br />\n<br />\nWe Are Looking For A ...<br />\n<br />\nBy CHARLES VERMONT<br />\nOn the eve of what may be for<br />\nsome students the most important exam of their academic career, it may be well for those<br />\ntaking the test not to examine<br />\nwhat they are being subjected to.<br />\nA student should always prepare<br />\nfor an important exam, if not<br />\nthrough actual study, then by<br />\npsychological preparation, that is,<br />\nby being well-rested or by becoming tense to the point where intelligence is induced. One key<br />\nhint on successful test taking is<br />\nto avoid asking unsettling questions concerning the meaning of<br />\none's activity during the fortyeight hour period preceding the<br />\ntest.<br />\nWarning: those taking the<br />\nSelective Service Examination<br />\nshould at all costs refrain from<br />\nasking penetrating questions because it is likely that one will<br />\nnot have to penetrate too far in<br />\norder to be upset. Many students<br />\nare already aware of their own<br />\nhypocrisy concerning the war.<br />\nOthers recognize that the haphazardness and the biases of Selective Service have placed them in<br />\na quandary.<br />\nMany of the students at Hopkins, who in one breath denounce<br />\nanti-war demonstrators, are turning around tomorrow and in another breath will be taking a test<br />\nto avoid fighting in a war which<br />\nthey advocate. The Selective<br />\nService Exam throws into relief<br />\nthe hypocrisy of these students.<br />\nIn fact, this may be the only<br />\ngood attribute of the test.<br />\n\"Why Me?\"<br />\nA question which is commonly<br />\nasked by draft-age men is \"Why<br />\nme?\" The draft is certainly haphazard. Only a small percentage<br />\nof draft-age men are ever inducted. For instance, in early<br />\n1965 Brig. Gen. Lynn D. Smith,<br />\nhead of the Army's enlisted personnel directorate, stated in Military Review that only 4.6% of<br />\nthe 10 million between 17 and 26<br />\nyears of age actually went into<br />\nthe Army in 1963. With a growing population, universality of<br />\nthe draft is a bit of a farce.<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, the pretense<br />\nuniversality is kept up.<br />\n<br />\nThat the draft is hapharzard is<br />\nobvious. It is obvious, too, that<br />\nit is biased. In the first place it is<br />\nbiased because those who never<br />\nhave a chance to go to college<br />\nare drafted first. The poor and<br />\nmembers of minority groups,<br />\nNegroes, Puerto Ricans, and<br />\nMexican-Americans, make up a<br />\ndisproportionate percentage of<br />\nthe armed forces. Thus there is<br />\nan element of class privilege involved in 2-S. But the biases do<br />\nnot stop; they go on to the college level.<br />\nScience-Biased<br />\nDeferments are granted in<br />\nthose areas that are critical to<br />\nnational defense, which in times<br />\nof manpower shortages essentially means the sciences. Tomorrow's examination will reflect<br />\nthis bias, but this is nothing new.<br />\nThe functions of the Selective<br />\nService go far beyond those of<br />\nprocuring bodies for the armed<br />\nforces. Its director, General Hershey, has already publicly characterized Selective Service as an<br />\nex-officio agency for national<br />\neconomic planning. Before the<br />\nHouse Armed Services Committee, Hershey stated: \"For the<br />\npast twenty years the selective<br />\nservice system has been what we<br />\ncall a channeler . .. The deferment is the carrot that we have<br />\nused to get individuals into occupations and professions that are<br />\nsaid by those in charge of the<br />\ngovernment to be the necessary<br />\nones.\" Economic planning is not<br />\na priori bad. The question is<br />\nplanning for whom and by whom.<br />\nPresently, the emphasis in Amer-<br />\n<br />\nCau<br />\n(Continued from Page 5)<br />\ntunity to read the whole article<br />\nbut I was particularly interested<br />\nin your presentation of he problem of the voter-driver and<br />\nyour comment that the age of<br />\n<br />\nONE-EYED, THREE-LEGGED CROSS BETWEEN<br />\nAN ALASKAN BIRD DOG AND A<br />\nSINCERE CHIHUAHUA<br />\nWe know the German word for<br />\n<br />\nelectrolumintscenct<br />\n<br />\nCHEMICAL PROCESS ENGINEER<br />\nWe are a leading manufacturer of unsaturated polyester resins and a division of one of the fastest.<br />\ngrowing chemical companies.<br />\nALL COMPANY BENEFITS<br />\nGROWTH OPPORTUNITY<br />\nMETROPOLITAN LOCATION STIMULATING WORK<br />\nEDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE VARIED ASSIGNMENTS<br />\nPLEASE SEND RESUME AND TRANSCRIPT TO:<br />\nJ.

If drafted their stature will be improved both physically and morally, a ploy much<br />\nused by Gen. Hershey to justify<br />\nthe principle of universality<br />\nwhen the draft system was under<br />\nattack by Congressional critics.<br />\nJohnson Magic<br />\nDuring peacetime (March and<br />\nApril 1964) a group of Congressmen led by Congressman Curtis<br />\nof Missouri and Senators led by<br />\nformer Sen. Keating of New<br />\nYork called for a comprehensive<br />\nreview of the draft. They had the<br />\nidea that the manpower practices of the armed forces could<br />\nbe made less expensive and more<br />\nefficient<br />\neconomically. Some<br />\neven felt that conscription could<br />\nbe abolished during peacetime.<br />\nPresident Johnson headed off this<br />\ngroup by calling for a study of<br />\nSelective Service by the Defense<br />\nDepartment. The report has not<br />\ncome out and is almost a year<br />\noverdue. Undoubtedly, Johnson's<br />\nmove was an exellent piece of<br />\nexecutive hocus-pocus. Now that<br />\nthe country is at war, attempts<br />\nat Selective Service reform may<br />\nbe branded unpatriotic, just as<br />\ncriticism of the war is sometimes branded unpatriotic. More<br />\noften criticism of the war is just<br />\ndisregarded by policy makers<br />\nwho make their policies stick<br />\nthrough public relations. Tomorrow's test is not a public relations item; it is the real thing.

Brubeck Quartette<br />\nTakes Five Too Many<br />\nBy PETER ONUF<br />\nHippies and pseudo-Hippies<br />\nthink a lot of different things<br />\nabout Brubeck. Hoppies, however, who made the Big Weekend Scene at Shriver were unanimous, if not in enthusiasm,<br />\nat least in trying to be enthusiastic. Tweedy old men tapped<br />\ntheir feet and smiled tentatively<br />\nat tweedy old ladies; Hopkins<br />\nmen and girls knew that this<br />\nwas the real thing. During the<br />\ncourse of the evening, the audience ranged from warm to hot<br />\nIn responsiveness and personal<br />\ncomfort, respectively. The Quartette blew cool and cold. If<br />\nanyone, Desmond was particularly disappointing\u2014he played<br />\nprettily on a couple of ballads,<br />\nbut generally wasn't interested\u2014<br />\nthe way he folds his hands over<br />\nhis axe is cool, however, if nothing else. He only got half worked-up over his own \"Take Five,\"<br />\nand fared only passably on another one of his standard solos<br />\nin \"Three to Get Ready.\" His<br />\nbest moments featured Gene<br />\nWright's steady and always rewarding basswork. Wright, in<br />\nfact, even seemed to be enjoying<br />\nhimself. Morello, however, is<br />\nconstitutionally unable to smile;<br />\nhe outcooled even Desmond, who<br />\ndespite his apathy showed an<br />\noccasional sparkle of humanity.<br />\nThe drummer knew he was good<br />\nand, like a true concert favorite,<br />\nknew how to get laughs and<br />\nnoise from the audience. Brubeck himself is hard to figure.<br />\nHippies generally write him off.<br />\nHe is certainly no Monk, nor is<br />\n- he a Bill Evans, but he does have<br />\nprofessional polish and an intelligent approach. If anyone cared,<br />\nhe did and most of the musically exciting moments of the<br />\nevening were during his solos\u2014<br />\nsome of this excitement was<br />\nnoise, some polyrhythmic virtuosity, and some, again, simple<br />\nIntelligence. There seemed to be<br />\nlittle rapport, however, between<br />\nDesmond and Brubeck, and the<br />\nQuartette to be at its best depends on this. Brubeck was at<br />\nhome with his rhythm, though,<br />\nand if the swing passages could<br />\nbe redeemed from Desmond's<br />\ntepid interpretations, Brubeck<br />\nwas able to do it.<br />\nAmong the numbers performed<br />\nwas a bit of church jazz, \"40<br />\nDays,\" which, if anything, was<br />\na vehicle for some of the better<br />\nsolos of the evening.

During the<br />\nnext four years, all too few of<br />\nthem ever return.<br />\nAt present, there are three extraordinary exhibits less than a<br />\nfive-minute walk from Levering.<br />\nThey range from Renaissance<br />\nJewels through Japanese photographs to pop and op art.<br />\n\"Pop and Op,\" an exhibition of<br />\n65 graphic works circulating<br />\nthroughout the country by the<br />\nAmerican Federation of Art, includes such contemporary<br />\n\"greats\" as Andy Warhol, Roy<br />\nLichtenstein, John Wesley and<br />\nEllsworth Kelly.<br />\nThe exhibit is rather more fun<br />\nthan stimulating or exciting. It is<br />\nall as would be expected: the op<br />\ndizzies, the pop is good old camp<br />\n(thank god Batman is excluded).<br />\nEven more exciting is the exhibition of works by three Japanese<br />\nphotographers, Hiroshi<br />\nHamaya, Koyo<br />\nOkada<br />\nand<br />\nTokutaro Tanaka. The exhibit<br />\ndemonstrates well what artistic<br />\nheights photography can achieve.<br />\nIn Japanese artistic tradition,<br />\nthe photographers concentrate on<br />\nparticular themes through a sequence of photographs in which<br />\nthey translate their perceptions<br />\nof nature and man into a feeling<br />\nand sensitive whole.<br />\nOkada, who has spent 50 years<br /><br />\nphotographing Mt. Fuji, captures<br />\nwell the many and changing faces<br />\nof the mountain in various angles and weather conditions. The<br />\nsubject is the same, but the photographs differ greatly in theme<br />\nand feeling.<br />\nTanaka's photographs of the<br />\nwhite egret, a beautiful and<br />\ngraceful bird, are filled with<br />\nechoes of Japanese brush painting. He uses twigs, plants and<br />\nangular structures to show the<br />\nsymmetry of the bird on a perch<br />\nand in flight.<br />\nHamaya captures the drudgery<br />\nand hardships of peasant life on<br />\nthe backcoast of Japan, especially in times of bad weather. It is<br />\na life of constant struggle with<br />\nthe natural elements of life.<br />\nThe latest exhibit to arrive at<br />\nthe museum is the Melvin Gutman Collection of Renaissance<br />\njewels in the recently completed<br />\nRenaissance Room of the Decorative Arts Gallery.<br />\nThe exhibit includes over 200<br />\njewels and jeweled objects de<br />\nvertue from all over Europe and<br />\nRussia which were made between<br />\nthe late 1400's and 1700. Most are<br />\nof gold, a few of silver, amber,<br />\npearl and ivory.<br />\nThe greatest tribute to the artistic taste of the museum exhibitors is the room itself, a mahagony panelled 17th century<br />\nroom transported from England<br />\nincluding authentic Renaissance<br />\nfurniture, statuary, and stained<br />\nglass windows.<br /><br />\nHopkins students, new and oh!, try:<br /><br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest Italian food in town<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br /><br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br />\nCALL 889-3831<br /><br />\nWe Are Looking For A ...<br /><br />\nBy CHARLES VERMONT<br />\nOn the eve of what may be for<br />\nsome students the most important exam of their academic career, it may be well for those<br />\ntaking the test not to examine<br />\nwhat they are being subjected to.<br />\nA student should always prepare<br />\nfor an important exam, if not<br />\nthrough actual study, then by<br />\npsychological preparation, that is,<br />\nby being well-rested or by becoming tense to the point where intelligence is induced. One key<br />\nhint on successful test taking is<br />\nto avoid asking unsettling questions concerning the meaning of<br />\none's activity during the fortyeight hour period preceding the<br />\ntest.<br />\nWarning: those taking the<br />\nSelective Service Examination<br />\nshould at all costs refrain from<br />\nasking penetrating questions because it is likely that one will<br />\nnot have to penetrate too far in<br />\norder to be upset. Many students<br />\nare already aware of their own<br />\nhypocrisy concerning the war.<br />\nOthers recognize that the haphazardness and the biases of Selective Service have placed them in<br />\na quandary.<br />\nMany of the students at Hopkins, who in one breath denounce<br />\nanti-war demonstrators, are turning around tomorrow and in another breath will be taking a test<br />\nto avoid fighting in a war which<br />\nthey advocate. The Selective<br />\nService Exam throws into relief<br />\nthe hypocrisy of these students.<br />\nIn fact, this may be the only<br />\ngood attribute of the test.<br />\n\"Why Me?\"<br />\nA question which is commonly<br />\nasked by draft-age men is \"Why<br />\nme?\" The draft is certainly haphazard. Only a small percentage<br />\nof draft-age men are ever inducted. For instance, in early<br />\n1965 Brig. Gen. Lynn D. Smith,<br />\nhead of the Army's enlisted personnel directorate, stated in Military Review that only 4.6% of<br />\nthe 10 million between 17 and 26<br />\nyears of age actually went into<br />\nthe Army in 1963. With a growing population, universality of<br />\nthe draft is a bit of a farce.<br /><br />\nNevertheless, the pretense<br />\nuniversality is kept up.<br /><br />\nThat the draft is hapharzard is<br />\nobvious. It is obvious, too, that<br />\nit is biased. In the first place it is<br />\nbiased because those who never<br />\nhave a chance to go to college<br />\nare drafted first. The poor and<br />\nmembers of minority groups,<br />\nNegroes, Puerto Ricans, and<br />\nMexican-Americans, make up a<br />\ndisproportionate percentage of<br />\nthe armed forces. Thus there is<br />\nan element of class privilege involved in 2-S. But the biases do<br />\nnot stop; they go on to the college level.<br />\nScience-Biased<br />\nDeferments are granted in<br />\nthose areas that are critical to<br />\nnational defense, which in times<br />\nof manpower shortages essentially means the sciences. Tomorrow's examination will reflect<br />\nthis bias, but this is nothing new.<br />\nThe functions of the Selective<br />\nService go far beyond those of<br />\nprocuring bodies for the armed<br />\nforces. Its director, General Hershey, has already publicly characterized Selective Service as an<br />\nex-officio agency for national<br />\neconomic planning. Before the<br />\nHouse Armed Services Committee, Hershey stated: \"For the<br />\npast twenty years the selective<br />\nservice system has been what we<br />\ncall a channeler . .. The deferment is the carrot that we have<br />\nused to get individuals into occupations and professions that are<br />\nsaid by those in charge of the<br />\ngovernment to be the necessary<br />\nones.\" Economic planning is not<br />\na priori bad. The question is<br />\nplanning for whom and by whom.<br />\nPresently, the emphasis in Amer-<br /><br />\nCau<br />\n(Continued from Page 5)<br />\ntunity to read the whole article<br />\nbut I was particularly interested<br />\nin your presentation of he problem of the voter-driver and<br />\nyour comment that the age of<br /><br />\nONE-EYED, THREE-LEGGED CROSS BETWEEN<br />\nAN ALASKAN BIRD DOG AND A<br />\nSINCERE CHIHUAHUA<br />\nWe know the German word for<br /><br />\nelectrolumintscenct<br /><br />\nCHEMICAL PROCESS ENGINEER<br />\nWe are a leading manufacturer of unsaturated polyester resins and a division of one of the fastest.<br />\ngrowing chemical companies.<br />\nALL COMPANY BENEFITS<br />\nGROWTH OPPORTUNITY<br />\nMETROPOLITAN LOCATION STIMULATING WORK<br />\nEDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE VARIED ASSIGNMENTS<br />\nPLEASE SEND RESUME AND TRANSCRIPT TO:<br />\nJ.

If drafted their stature will be improved both physically and morally, a ploy much<br />\nused by Gen. Hershey to justify<br />\nthe principle of universality<br />\nwhen the draft system was under<br />\nattack by Congressional critics.<br />\nJohnson Magic<br />\nDuring peacetime (March and<br />\nApril 1964) a group of Congressmen led by Congressman Curtis<br />\nof Missouri and Senators led by<br />\nformer Sen. Keating of New<br />\nYork called for a comprehensive<br />\nreview of the draft. They had the<br />\nidea that the manpower practices of the armed forces could<br />\nbe made less expensive and more<br />\nefficient<br />\neconomically. Some<br />\neven felt that conscription could<br />\nbe abolished during peacetime.<br />\nPresident Johnson headed off this<br />\ngroup by calling for a study of<br />\nSelective Service by the Defense<br />\nDepartment. The report has not<br />\ncome out and is almost a year<br />\noverdue. Undoubtedly, Johnson's<br />\nmove was an exellent piece of<br />\nexecutive hocus-pocus. Now that<br />\nthe country is at war, attempts<br />\nat Selective Service reform may<br />\nbe branded unpatriotic, just as<br />\ncriticism of the war is sometimes branded unpatriotic. More<br />\noften criticism of the war is just<br />\ndisregarded by policy makers<br />\nwho make their policies stick<br />\nthrough public relations. Tomorrow's test is not a public relations item; it is the real thing.
