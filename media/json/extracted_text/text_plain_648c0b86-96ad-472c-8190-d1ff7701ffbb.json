SCHEIDT, '30<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Company, Lombard and South Streets,<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL COMMENT<br />\nA WELCOME INNOVATION<br />\nRADITION concerning college year books is very emphatic regarding one point. Every 'university annual must have some<br />\none theme which motivates its art work and general make-up. bowing<br />\nto this universal custom, the editors of the 1927 Hullabaloo employed the life career of a knight in armor as the central theme of<br />\nthe illustrations which introduced the various classes. The freshmen were represented as young warriors about to serve their apprenticeships. An \u2022illustration of a sheep herder tending his flocks<br />\nintroduced the sophomores. A sketch of a warrior paying homage<br />\nto his lady was the froutpiece for the junior's section, while the<br />\nseniors were symbolized by a knight in the act of slaying a dragon.<br />\nThis year, the Hullabaloo staff will,attempt an innovation: Instead of adopting some theme, fcireigli' to the University, they have<br />\ndecided to use, as their motivating idea, the life of Sidney Lanierr<br />\nLamer, contrary to the popular notion of many students, was.a man of action. He was not the conventional .poet---the-half human,<br />\neccentric individual who ekes out a bare existence in some actic.<br />\nHe was not the Bohemian type -which lives solely for the life philosophy of \"art for art's 'sake.\" Lanier led an active,- diverse life.<br />\nHe fought with Robert E. Lee in the Civil War and endured the<br />\nhardships of the prison camp. He was an accomplished musician,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nan ardent student and an enthusiastic teacher.<br />\nEven though his body' was wracked with the ravagd of disease,<br />\nSidney Lamer continued on, doggedly, persistently, fighting the good.<br />\nfight. HiS beautiful lyrics reflect in no way the utter hopelessness<br />\nand despair which followed him to his grave.<br />\nUnfottunately, however, we feel that Lanier's work and the prominent place which he holds in American literature is not properly '<br />\nappreciated by the University undergraduate of today. Once a year,<br />\nan assembly is held to honot the memory of the great poet and the<br />\nrambling ivy on Gilmao Hall's walls commemorates the deeds of this<br />\nfamed alumnus. But, in spite of these attempts to keep the memory<br />\nof Lanier alive, we fear that the real significance of his work has<br />\nnot-been made sufficiently impressive.<br />\nPerhaps some day the University will see fit to establish a regular.<br />\nundergraduate course for the study of Lanier's life and writings.<br />\nCertainly, such a course would be the most appropriate of all memorials.<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\nIn adopting Lanier's life for its art theme, the 1929 Hullabaloo<br />\nstaff is rendering a real service.. It will show the poet in the true<br />\nlight of his accomplishments. He will be revealed as a soldier, a<br />\nteacher and a musician, as well as a poet. And, above all, it will<br />\nshow Lanier as a'man of courage, a man of valor and a man of<br />\naction.<br />\n<br />\nnights.

SCHEIDT, '30<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Company, Lombard and South Streets,<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL COMMENT<br />\nA WELCOME INNOVATION<br />\nRADITION concerning college year books is very emphatic regarding one point. Every 'university annual must have some<br />\none theme which motivates its art work and general make-up. bowing<br />\nto this universal custom, the editors of the 1927 Hullabaloo employed the life career of a knight in armor as the central theme of<br />\nthe illustrations which introduced the various classes. The freshmen were represented as young warriors about to serve their apprenticeships. An \u2022illustration of a sheep herder tending his flocks<br />\nintroduced the sophomores. A sketch of a warrior paying homage<br />\nto his lady was the froutpiece for the junior's section, while the<br />\nseniors were symbolized by a knight in the act of slaying a dragon.<br />\nThis year, the Hullabaloo staff will,attempt an innovation: Instead of adopting some theme, fcireigli' to the University, they have<br />\ndecided to use, as their motivating idea, the life of Sidney Lanierr<br />\nLamer, contrary to the popular notion of many students, was.a man of action. He was not the conventional .poet---the-half human,<br />\neccentric individual who ekes out a bare existence in some actic.<br />\nHe was not the Bohemian type -which lives solely for the life philosophy of \"art for art's 'sake.\" Lanier led an active,- diverse life.<br />\nHe fought with Robert E. Lee in the Civil War and endured the<br />\nhardships of the prison camp. He was an accomplished musician,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nan ardent student and an enthusiastic teacher.<br />\nEven though his body' was wracked with the ravagd of disease,<br />\nSidney Lamer continued on, doggedly, persistently, fighting the good.<br />\nfight. HiS beautiful lyrics reflect in no way the utter hopelessness<br />\nand despair which followed him to his grave.<br />\nUnfottunately, however, we feel that Lanier's work and the prominent place which he holds in American literature is not properly '<br />\nappreciated by the University undergraduate of today. Once a year,<br />\nan assembly is held to honot the memory of the great poet and the<br />\nrambling ivy on Gilmao Hall's walls commemorates the deeds of this<br />\nfamed alumnus. But, in spite of these attempts to keep the memory<br />\nof Lanier alive, we fear that the real significance of his work has<br />\nnot-been made sufficiently impressive.<br />\nPerhaps some day the University will see fit to establish a regular.<br />\nundergraduate course for the study of Lanier's life and writings.<br />\nCertainly, such a course would be the most appropriate of all memorials.<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\nIn adopting Lanier's life for its art theme, the 1929 Hullabaloo<br />\nstaff is rendering a real service.. It will show the poet in the true<br />\nlight of his accomplishments. He will be revealed as a soldier, a<br />\nteacher and a musician, as well as a poet.
