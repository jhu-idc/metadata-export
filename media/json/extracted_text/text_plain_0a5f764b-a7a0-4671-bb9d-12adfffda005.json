Today<br />\nthe tenseness and double-dealings of<br />\ninternational rivalry have resulted in<br />\nthe exaltation of patriotism over<br />\ntruth as the essential element and<br />\nvirtue of statesmanship. The chances<br />\nare very great that the world will<br />\nshortly find itself in the chaos of<br />\nanother great War. When that war<br />\ncomes, one of its chief weapons will<br />\nbe falsehood, and lying. The casual,<br />\neveryday lie is often condoned, or at<br />\nleast ignored. But the wholesale deception of an entire nation by official<br />\nconnivance cannot be easily neglected.<br />\nLord Ponsonby has collected in his<br />\nsmall volume a group of the more<br />\ncommon, more insidious lies circulated in England, France, Germany,<br />\nItaly, and America during the War.<br />\nA long career in parliament and the<br />\ndiplomatic service has given him<br />\nboth the means and the ability to<br />\ntrace these lies to their sources.<br />\nThe denial of England's commitments to France, the invasion of<br />\nBelgium as the causus belli, the war<br />\nguilt of Germany, the passage of<br />\nRussian troops through England, the<br />\nstories of the mutilated nurse, the<br />\nhandless baby, the crucified Canadian,<br />\nand the German corpse factory are<br />\nobjectively, calmly, but relentlessly<br />\ntraced by Lord Ponsonby to their<br />\norigins and exposed as deliberate subterfuge and trickery on the part of<br />\nsupposedly responsible governments.<br />\n\"There is not a living soul in any<br />\ncountry who does not deeply resent having his passions roused,<br />\nhis indignation flamed, his pariotism exploited, and his highest<br />\nideals desecrated by concealment,<br />\nsubterfuge, fraud, trickery, and<br />\ndeliberate lying on the part of<br />\nthose in whom he is taught to<br />\nrepose confidence and to whom<br />\nhe Is enjoined to pay respect.<br />\n'None of the heroes prepared for<br />\nsuffering and sacrifice, none of<br />\nthe common herd ready for service and obedience, will be inclined<br />\nto listen to the call of their country once they discover the polluted sources from whence that<br />\ncall proceeds and recognize the<br />\nmonstrous finger of falsehood<br />\nwhich beckons them to the battlefield.\"<br />\nEducation of this type at this time<br />\nwill put a previously unsuspecting<br />\npeople on its guard when the debacle<br />\ncomes, will render it much less cred-<br /><br />\nREVIEWS<br /><br />\n-:-<br /><br />\nulous of statements, rumours, and lies like a man unveiling a statue of himissued specifically for its consumption self.
