Thus the<br />\nmembers of one division of engineering will have the opportimity<br />\nof hearing a report or talk on interesting and practical problems<br />\nwhich confront the men in other<br />\nphases of the engineering work.<br />\nThe men nominated by their respective branches were: J.

Perkins, of the electrical department. The election of the<br />\nchairmen was taken up by the entire society, which chose E. M.<br />\nStuart, S. E. Howard and L.

However, before speaking of his<br />\narticle, it seems proper to question the sincerity of a reformer,<br />\nwho does not have backbone<br />\nenough to shoulder the responsibility of his ideas by signing his<br />\nname to his letter. A man who<br />\nwishes to accomplish a reformation must not start out by making<br />\nthe mistake of doing the thing he<br />\nwishes to have reformed. He<br />\nshould not show mere half-hearted<br />\ninterest and lack of real spirit,<br />\nbut, if he has any faith in his<br />\nideas and convictions, he sholild<br />\nbe both willing to acknowledge<br />\nand to fight for them.<br />\nThe attitude of the \"Would-Be<br />\nRooter,\" and others of the student-body who agree with him,<br />\nnamely, the lack of true interest,<br />\nearnest desire, stability of purpose, and ,loyal support, along<br />\nwith the unwillingness to bear<br />\nfull responsibility, to fight and<br />\nundergo a defeat seems to me to<br />\nbe the trouble with Hopkins. If<br />\nthe football team is winning,<br />\neverything is all right; but as<br />\nsoon as the team takes a slump\u2014<br />\nloses a game\u2014then the talk begins. The team coaches and management come in for their share<br />\nof criticism, which, in most cases,<br />\nthey are far from meriting. Failing to see that under these circumstances, when things look<br />\nblue, the team needs help and encouragement, is what needs correction. Therefore, if you desire<br />\na change in the athletic policy,<br />\nwait until the time of policymaking and urge it; if the students want it they will adopt it<br />\nat the proper time, but do not<br />\nyou, as one of them, sieze the moment when those, whom you have<br />\nchosen to carry out the accepted<br />\npolicies, are in the press of doubtful battle to ridicule the plan and<br />\nassail the leaders from cover of<br />\nsuch a pseudonym as \"Would-Be<br />\nRooter.\" Every Hopkins man is a<br />\n\"Should-Be Rooter.\"<br />\nThe writer said in his fist letter,<br />\n\"the fault does not lie with us,<br />\nit lies with the Athletic Association.\" What is the Athletic Association but another .form of the<br />\nstudent body who compose and<br />\ncontrol it? The management of<br />\nthe Athletic Association can merely carry out the policies of its<br />\nmembers, and it has done this in<br />\n<br />\nthe most.efficient and satisfactory<br />\nmanner which was possible with<br />\nthe means in its hand. It was<br />\nsaid that its policy was primarily<br />\nto make money, and then the use<br />\nof old football equipment was<br />\nquoted to uphold this point. , In<br />\nanswer I would like to state that<br />\nit is not a question of making,<br />\nbut of not going in a debt which<br />\nkeeps the management from<br />\nmaking expenditures. How much<br />\neasier it would be if the managers<br />\ncould simply buy and not worry<br />\nover how these bills are paid. I<br />\nam sure that the management<br />\nwould be delighted to purchase<br />\nequipment if some one else were<br />\npaying the bills, or if they knew<br />\nfrom what source funds to meet<br />\nthese expenditures were to be<br />\ndrawn.<br />\nTo discuss the question of football equipment in particular, I<br />\nwould like to state that a sum of<br />\nmoney which would have more<br />\nthan thoroughly equipped a former<br />\nHopkins team has been spent, but<br />\nthat this year, with 56 candidates<br />\nout for the team, the, strain on<br />\nthe management to furnish equipment has been very great. This<br />\nnecessarily requires the use of<br />\nsome old equipment, and as is<br />\nthe custom at other large colleges,<br />\nthis equipment is given to the second-string men, while the 'varsity<br />\nreceives the new outfits.<br />\nThe managerial system, which<br />\nthe writer called a farce, is the<br />\nmost effective system at the present time in use at any of the other<br />\nuniversities or colleges. That this<br />\nsystem in itself is excellent seems<br />\nunnecessary to prove, for it is selfevident. The working of such a<br />\nsystem is always limited by the<br />\nmaterial it has to work with, and,<br />\nif the system fails to turn out efficient managers, it is because the<br />\nstudent body has not taken<br />\nenough interest individually and<br />\nas a whole to insure its best results. Only by having keen competition among the assistant managers, and a general interest in<br />\nthe selection of the manager by<br />\nthe board, can good managers be<br />\nobtained.<br />\nHowever, the question is again<br />\nreduced to the fact that the student body controls the Athletic<br />\nAssociation and, if it does not<br />\nlike the managerial system, or the<br />\nworkings of such a system, it is<br />\nup to it to change them. Failing to do this, the student body<br />\nshould endeavor to support the<br />\nsystem in its workings. In other<br />\nwords\u2014do something. Change it,<br />\nor support it, but don't just talk.<br />\nThe statement that Charlie<br />\nBrickley was brought to Hopkins<br />\nsimply as a financial policy is absurd. The alumni and football<br />\nadvisors thought that they might<br />\narouse the undergraduates by<br />\nbringing to Hopkins a coach who<br />\nhad just finished his college career, and who could turn out a<br />\nsuccessful team. They secured<br />\nBrickley; their hopes and ours<br />\nwere realized.

Thus the<br />\nmembers of one division of engineering will have the opportimity<br />\nof hearing a report or talk on interesting and practical problems<br />\nwhich confront the men in other<br />\nphases of the engineering work.<br />\nThe men nominated by their respective branches were: J. Trueman Thompson and Edward M.<br />\nStuart, of the mechanical engineering department; Stanley E.<br />\nHoward, of the civil department;<br />\nand Louis McC. Young and Everett E. Perkins, of the electrical department. The election of the<br />\nchairmen was taken up by the entire society, which chose E. M.<br />\nStuart, S. E. Howard and L. McC.<br />\nYoung, all of the 1917 class.<br />\nInterest in the Engineering Society is growing considerably, and<br />\nit promises soon to become one of<br />\nthe most important of the student<br />\nactivities. At other colleges offices on the Engineering Society<br />\nhoard are looked upon as coveted<br />\nhonors. At the University of<br />\nWisconsin, for instance, where<br />\nboth Prof. C. C. Thomas and Prof.<br />\nA. G. Christie, instructors in mechanical engineering here, taught<br />\nfor several years, the election of<br />\nthe gociety was one of the big<br />\nevents of the year.<br />\nInteresting talks will be arranged by the society, and the student-body as a whole are invited<br />\nto attend. Most of the lectures<br />\nwill be illustrated with slides.<br /><br />\n343 NORTH CHARLES STREET<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nMARLEY 21/<br />\n2 IN.

Edison who never<br />\nsaw the inside of a college as a<br />\nstudent, once had in his laboratory a man fresh from one of our<br />\ngreat universities, where he had<br />\nbeen graduated at the head of his<br />\nclass. Soon this young Bachelor<br />\nof Arts met much that upset his<br />\npet theories. But he would not readjust these theories. When<br />\nthings were done contrary to rules<br />\nlaid down in the books, he looked<br />\non with indulgence.<br />\n\"One day Mr. Edison unscrewed<br />\nfrom its socket an incandescent<br />\n-electric light bulb.'Find the cubic<br />\ncontents of this!' he said to the<br />\ncollege graduate.<br />\n\"To work out the problem by<br />\nmathematical rote was about as<br />\ndifficult as squaring the circle.<br />\nBut the college student went at it<br />\nboldly. Reams of paper were figured and disfigured by his energetic pencil during the next few<br />\ndays. Finally he brought to Mr.<br />\nEdison the result of his calculations. 'You're at least 10 per cent.<br />\nout of the way,' said the inventor.<br />\nThe graduate, sublimely confident, disputed this.<br />\n\"All right,' said Edison calmly.

However, before speaking of his<br />\narticle, it seems proper to question the sincerity of a reformer,<br />\nwho does not have backbone<br />\nenough to shoulder the responsibility of his ideas by signing his<br />\nname to his letter. A man who<br />\nwishes to accomplish a reformation must not start out by making<br />\nthe mistake of doing the thing he<br />\nwishes to have reformed. He<br />\nshould not show mere half-hearted<br />\ninterest and lack of real spirit,<br />\nbut, if he has any faith in his<br />\nideas and convictions, he sholild<br />\nbe both willing to acknowledge<br />\nand to fight for them.<br />\nThe attitude of the \"Would-Be<br />\nRooter,\" and others of the student-body who agree with him,<br />\nnamely, the lack of true interest,<br />\nearnest desire, stability of purpose, and ,loyal support, along<br />\nwith the unwillingness to bear<br />\nfull responsibility, to fight and<br />\nundergo a defeat seems to me to<br />\nbe the trouble with Hopkins. If<br />\nthe football team is winning,<br />\neverything is all right; but as<br />\nsoon as the team takes a slump\u2014<br />\nloses a game\u2014then the talk begins. The team coaches and management come in for their share<br />\nof criticism, which, in most cases,<br />\nthey are far from meriting. Failing to see that under these circumstances, when things look<br />\nblue, the team needs help and encouragement, is what needs correction. Therefore, if you desire<br />\na change in the athletic policy,<br />\nwait until the time of policymaking and urge it; if the students want it they will adopt it<br />\nat the proper time, but do not<br />\nyou, as one of them, sieze the moment when those, whom you have<br />\nchosen to carry out the accepted<br />\npolicies, are in the press of doubtful battle to ridicule the plan and<br />\nassail the leaders from cover of<br />\nsuch a pseudonym as \"Would-Be<br />\nRooter.\" Every Hopkins man is a<br />\n\"Should-Be Rooter.\"<br />\nThe writer said in his fist letter,<br />\n\"the fault does not lie with us,<br />\nit lies with the Athletic Association.\" What is the Athletic Association but another .form of the<br />\nstudent body who compose and<br />\ncontrol it? The management of<br />\nthe Athletic Association can merely carry out the policies of its<br />\nmembers, and it has done this in<br /><br />\nthe most.efficient and satisfactory<br />\nmanner which was possible with<br />\nthe means in its hand. It was<br />\nsaid that its policy was primarily<br />\nto make money, and then the use<br />\nof old football equipment was<br />\nquoted to uphold this point. , In<br />\nanswer I would like to state that<br />\nit is not a question of making,<br />\nbut of not going in a debt which<br />\nkeeps the management from<br />\nmaking expenditures. How much<br />\neasier it would be if the managers<br />\ncould simply buy and not worry<br />\nover how these bills are paid. I<br />\nam sure that the management<br />\nwould be delighted to purchase<br />\nequipment if some one else were<br />\npaying the bills, or if they knew<br />\nfrom what source funds to meet<br />\nthese expenditures were to be<br />\ndrawn.<br />\nTo discuss the question of football equipment in particular, I<br />\nwould like to state that a sum of<br />\nmoney which would have more<br />\nthan thoroughly equipped a former<br />\nHopkins team has been spent, but<br />\nthat this year, with 56 candidates<br />\nout for the team, the, strain on<br />\nthe management to furnish equipment has been very great.

That this<br />\nsystem in itself is excellent seems<br />\nunnecessary to prove, for it is selfevident. The working of such a<br />\nsystem is always limited by the<br />\nmaterial it has to work with, and,<br />\nif the system fails to turn out efficient managers, it is because the<br />\nstudent body has not taken<br />\nenough interest individually and<br />\nas a whole to insure its best results. Only by having keen competition among the assistant managers, and a general interest in<br />\nthe selection of the manager by<br />\nthe board, can good managers be<br />\nobtained.<br />\nHowever, the question is again<br />\nreduced to the fact that the student body controls the Athletic<br />\nAssociation and, if it does not<br />\nlike the managerial system, or the<br />\nworkings of such a system, it is<br />\nup to it to change them.
