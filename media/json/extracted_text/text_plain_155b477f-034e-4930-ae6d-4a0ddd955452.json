It is already supposed to be handling used books<br />\nas a result of Student Council action last year. Evidently they do<br />\nnot care for the present arrangement as is evidenced by new plans<br />\nwhich have been released by this year's Student Council.<br />\nUnder one plan the Bookstore will buy the books from students<br />\ngiving them a fifty percent return on the list price. The Bookstoi:e<br />\nwill re-sell the books at seventy-five percent of the original price.<br />\nIn both instances the prices offered are too high. Students interested in used books are looking for something inexpensive, not a<br />\nbook just twenty-five percent less than the price of a new text.<br />\nThe best plan seems to be that set forth by the Sudent Council.<br />\nThey suggested that used books be sold by students working under<br />\nconcession rules through the Bureau of Appointments. This would<br />\nappear to be the logical system. Under this plan, students with a<br />\ndirect financial interest would insure the plan's success and more<br />\nthan likely the high prices offered in the first plan by the Bookstore<br />\ncould be reduced considerably.<br />\n<br />\nNewest Local Magazine Appraised;<br />\nSeen As Almost A One Man Show<br />\nOver a quarter of a century ago,<br />\ntwo aspiring college graduates set<br />\nup in a rented corner in New York<br />\nthe crude beginnings of one of<br />\nAmerica's<br />\ngreatest<br />\nmagazines,<br />\nTime.

This problem has<br />\ncarried from ,one year to another and should be solved now.<br />\nSince there have been so many ideas set forth as to methods of<br />\nhandling used books it seems apparent that no one wants to be<br />\nbothered with the excess work which arises from buying and<br />\nre-selling these books.<br />\n(<br /><br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, November 9, 1951<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FOUR<br /><br />\nThe Bookstore certainly should be the organization to handle<br />\nused books. It is already supposed to be handling used books<br />\nas a result of Student Council action last year. Evidently they do<br />\nnot care for the present arrangement as is evidenced by new plans<br />\nwhich have been released by this year's Student Council.<br />\nUnder one plan the Bookstore will buy the books from students<br />\ngiving them a fifty percent return on the list price. The Bookstoi:e<br />\nwill re-sell the books at seventy-five percent of the original price.<br />\nIn both instances the prices offered are too high. Students interested in used books are looking for something inexpensive, not a<br />\nbook just twenty-five percent less than the price of a new text.<br />\nThe best plan seems to be that set forth by the Sudent Council.<br />\nThey suggested that used books be sold by students working under<br />\nconcession rules through the Bureau of Appointments. This would<br />\nappear to be the logical system.
