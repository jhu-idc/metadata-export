The Editorial<br />\nBoard voted unanimously at its<br />\nmeeting Tuesday in the Trophy<br />\nRoom to give the class-book to Dr.<br />\nFrank J.

One<br />\nadvocated a Hullabaloo of the<br />\nsame style as previous issues, and<br />\nthe other was for a burlesque on<br />\nformer Hullabaloos. After much<br />\ndiscussion a compromise plan was<br />\nhit upon, which calls for a book<br />\nof much comedy and \"original<br />\nfeatures\" and some burlesque. The<br />\ncompromise was reached happily,<br />\nand the minority will pitch in and<br />\nwork for the success of \"the most<br />\ninteresting class-book Hopkins has<br />\never had.\"<br />\nAdvertising Manager Merrick reports progress in his work. Business Manager Spencer, however,<br />\nfinds fund collecting rather slow,<br />\nand Editor Short is still smiling<br />\nover some of the \"copy\" which he<br />\nhas received.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Frank J. Goodnow, president<br />\nof the University, will be the guest<br />\nof honor at the \"dinner meeting\" of<br />\nthe New York Academy of Political Science on Thursday evening at<br />\nthe Astor Hotel in New York. Dr.<br />\nGoodnow was formerly a trustee of<br />\nthe Academy.<br />\nAccording to an announcement<br />\nsent out by the New York alumni<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, the Hopkins men<br />\nwill join the former colleagues of<br />\nDr. Goodnow at Columbia University in taking advantage of the coming dinner to welcome him back<br />\nfrom the Orient and to wish him<br />\nsuccess in his new work in Baltimore. Special tables will be reserved for both Columbia and Hopkins men at the dinner. Among<br />\nthe speakers of the evening will be<br />\nDr. Goodnow, Senator Elihu Root<br />\n<br />\nPresident Goodnow returned last<br />\nweek from Princeton, where he attended the convention of the Association of American Universities.<br />\nThis Association is an organization of college presidents, or of<br />\ntheir personal representatives, and<br />\nmeets to discuss matters of interest<br />\nto the college world. The meetings<br />\nare rather informal\u2014the object being that of \"getting together\" and<br />\nworking for the standardization of<br />\nstudies and institutions.<br />\nA great deal of discussion was<br />\ngiven to the question of honorary<br />\ndegrees, and to ymethods of awarding fellowships and scholarships.<br />\nEach University has its own particular procedure in these matters,<br />\nand it is recognized by all . that<br />\nsome degree of uniformity should<br />\nbe adopted. What action was taken<br />\nis not known, but the first steps towards a standard have been made.<br />\nPresident Vincent of the University of Minnesota read a paper on<br />\n\"University Publications\"\u2014such as<br />\nwe have here in \"Modern Language<br />\nNotes\" and studies in history and<br />\npolitical science. The best way to<br />\nmanage these was sought, and the<br />\npaper brought out a great deal of<br />\nwholesome discussion. President<br />\nLowell of Harvard presented a<br />\npaper of interest on -The Economy<br />\nof Time.\"<br />\nOne of the most striking developments of the meeting was the<br />\nbringing to notice of the new Western experiments in education, which<br />\nso far have proved able to shorten<br />\nschool and college work by one<br />\nyear, and which are hoped to be<br />\nable to cut at least another year<br />\nfrom the time necessary to complete an education.<br />\n\u2022 The University of Chicago has<br />\nset up a complete school, from the<br />\nearliest stages to the last year of<br />\nhigh school, in connection with<br />\ntheir department of education. In<br />\nthis, it has been found that by coordinating the effort of the pupils,<br />\na year is saved. It is not a system of cramming for college, nor<br />\nare the students overworked. The<br />\nobject is merely to eliminate the<br />\nwaste of time that is sure to occur<br />\nin the education of the average pupil. The results have been highly<br />\nencouraging to the experimenters,<br />\nand they are enthusiastic over the<br />\nidea.<br />\nThe Western institution, the<br />\nJunior College, was fully explained.<br />\nThis is another evolution in education, and aims to do away with the<br />\n\u2022 intermediary. A. B. course which<br />\n\u2022 heretofore has stood between the<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins was defeated by<br />\nHaverford College at Homewood<br />\non Saturday by a score of 10 to o.,<br />\nThis score probably represents the<br />\nrelative merits of the teams as they<br />\nlined up. Without wishing to detract from Haverford's performance and without any apologies for<br />\nHopkins' failure to win, it should<br />\nbe stated that we put a patched up<br />\nteam on the field. If Haverford's<br />\nteam is really as good as claimed<br />\nby its supporters, then we should<br />\nbe well pleased with the work of<br />\nour team on Saturday.<br />\nBarring a long end run by<br />\nHaverford in the first few minutes<br />\nof play, and our failure in the<br />\nearly stages of the game to diagnose a really good delayed forward pass, the teams played pretty<br />\nevenly. Our offence was poor.<br />\nThis was due in part to the fact that<br />\nthe Haverford defence was good,<br />\nand in part to the fact that our back<br />\nfield had never even run signals,<br />\nto say nothing of not having- scrimmaged as a combination. Injuries<br />\nof a minor nature, but sufficiently<br />\nserious to impair their efficiency,<br />\nkept B. Randall and Tischler out<br />\nof the game at the last minute.<br />\nThis, with Captain Wilkinson's<br />\nlameness, rendered effective offensive work out of the question.<br />\nAn offensive campaign requires<br />\nmuch drilling of men. Time for<br />\nthis is not available so we have<br />\nto be content with developing our<br />\nmen in theory only. The results<br />\nare painfully obvious. There is<br />\nsome consolation in the thought<br />\nthat men who do really creditable<br />\nwork with almost no practice would<br />\ndo splendid work if they were<br />\ngiven half a chance.<br />\nIt all comes back to a question<br />\nof time. Football should not be developed at the expense of time<br />\nnecessary for scholastic work. It<br />\nseems to be conceded, however,<br />\nthat some time should be devoted<br />\nto football, and when the day arrives when the time so conceded<br />\nmay be available by daylight and<br />\nnot dark, then we may hope to<br />\nmake some real progress.<br />\nThe season has developed one<br />\nthing certainly, and that is that our<br />\nmen have good stuff in them. That<br />\nthey can and do play determined<br />\nup-hill football against odds which<br />\nare not apparent to the casual on-looker. Even in such defeats as<br />\nhave been experienced this year,<br />\nevery Hopkins man has good reason to be proud of his team.

For<br />\nthe second time he \"fooled\" his<br />\ndoctors as he said Ile would.<br />\nThey told. Bob his chances for<br />\nrecovery were very slight.<br />\n\"But I'll fool you,\" he said, and<br />\nwhen his nurse returned to the<br />\nroom when the doctor left, Bob told<br />\nher that she must help him fight<br />\nagainst the doctor's verdict.<br />\nWhen he learned that the football schedule probably would be<br />\ncancelled should Ile die, he protested. He sent for his mother at<br />\nonce, and asked her to see that all<br />\ngames were played in spite of his<br />\ncondition, and even should he die.<br />\nwhen his father learned of the request, he too agreed with Bob, and<br />\nthe football management has been<br />\nasked by all three of the Layfields<br />\nto continue through the season.<br />\nIt has been two weeks since the<br />\nLehigh game, in which Layfield sustained the broken backbone, from<br />\nwhich leading doctors at Johns<br />\nHopkins said he would not recover.<br />\nIt is surprising to them that he<br />\nhas lived so long, and friends who<br />\nknow of his pluck and determination see these characteristics making themselves evident in his fight<br />\nto put off the end.<br />\nHe was tired of his milk diet, and<br />\nasked for a change. His doctors<br />\nsaid he might have tea, and Bob<br />\nreplied:<br />\n\"But make it safe-tea first.\"<br />\nOne of his chief delights is to<br />\nshow the visitor his Black and<br />\nBlue sweater with the honorary<br />\n\"H\" that was awarded him at a<br />\nspecial meeting of the Athletic Association.<br />\nThe sweater hangs on the post<br />\nof his bed where he can see it and<br />\npoint it out to his friends.

I think<br />\nthe chief influence of a University<br />\n.11 as is<br />\nis not in actual study so muc<br />\nin the spirit transmitted by the faculty and associations.<br />\nHopkins has a great name for<br />\nconservatism, and it is the spirit<br />\nof dignity and reserve, of calm<br />\nthoughtfulness and watchful waiting that characterizes and makes<br />\nsuccessful and tolerable the men<br />\nwho go out into the professional<br />\nand business worlds with the label<br />\n\"He is a Hopkins man.\"<br />\nI am proud that I shall be called<br />\na Hopkins man, but I am ashamed<br />\nthat I know so little of Hopkins,<br />\nof Sylvester, Gilman, Lanier and<br />\nthe others of whom you spoke.

Your memorial society is a<br />\nhappy suggestion, and I suggest<br />\nthat some member or members of<br />\nour faculty organize it. I for one<br />\nwill join, and I believe there are<br />\nmany more in the University who<br />\nwould like to take advantage of<br />\nsuch an opportunity to learn of<br />\nHopkins' glories of the past.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nA FRIEND OF YOURS.<br />\n<br />\ncause the Gettysburg team wore<br />\n<br />\nlarge numbers sewed on their backs.<br />\n<br />\nORGANIZATION MEETINGS<br />\nTO BE HELD IN DECEMBER<br />\n<br />\nWhat person who sat in the stands<br />\nwould not have known the quarterback (No. 8) of the opposition<br />\nwhen the action of play was on the<br />\nother side of the field. No. 8 made<br />\nthe majority of his team's gains,<br />\nbut he would not have been so<br />\nconspicuous had it not been for the<br />\nfact that the Gettysburg players<br />\nwere numbered.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Hopkins team<br />\nwas not numbered, and the result<br />\nwas that whenever a Hopkins player made a sterling play our cheer<br />\nleader was compelled to ask, \"Who<br />\nwas that?\" There were usually<br />\nabout three or four answers given,<br />\nfrom which one name was chosen<br />\nand a cheer given for that player.<br />\nIt is quite difficult to pick out a<br />\nstar player. \"with red hair,\" as the<br />\ntop of a football player's head is<br />\nusually protected by a headgear.<br />\nIt is also difficult to recognize the<br />\nstar everytime, as several men have<br />\nsimilar statures and -several wear<br />\nankle stays. Finally, the majority<br />\nof the spectators do not know the<br />\nHopkins players when they see<br />\nthem and would enjoy the games<br />\nmuch more if the Hopkins men<br />\nwore numbers.<br />\nFor these few reasons I believe<br />\nthat it is advisable for Hopkins to<br />\nget in line with the other big colleges in the country and number<br />\ntheir football players.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nA HOPKINS PROGRESSIVE.<br />\n<br />\nOrganization meetings of the<br />\ntrack, lacrosse and baseball squads<br />\nwill be held soon after the close<br />\nof the football season; all those<br />\ninterested in Hopkins athletics are<br />\nasked to be present at these meetings.<br />\nThe date for the lacrosse organization has been set for Tuesday,<br />\nDecember 1.

The Editorial<br />\nBoard voted unanimously at its<br />\nmeeting Tuesday in the Trophy<br />\nRoom to give the class-book to Dr.<br />\nFrank J. Goodnow, who, in the'few<br />\ntimes he has addressed the undergraduates, has become widely popular.<br />\nA full page cut of a special<br />\nphotograph of the new president<br />\nwill be a feature of the Hullabaloo,<br />\nthe dedication taking this form.<br />\nAnother full page portrait will be<br />\nthat of Dr. John C. French, the<br />\nhonorary president of the senior<br />\nclass.<br />\nThe first business meeting of<br />\nthe editors and business staff was<br />\ndevoted to a formulation of \"policy.\" Two views were held. One<br />\nadvocated a Hullabaloo of the<br />\nsame style as previous issues, and<br />\nthe other was for a burlesque on<br />\nformer Hullabaloos. After much<br />\ndiscussion a compromise plan was<br />\nhit upon, which calls for a book<br />\nof much comedy and \"original<br />\nfeatures\" and some burlesque. The<br />\ncompromise was reached happily,<br />\nand the minority will pitch in and<br />\nwork for the success of \"the most<br />\ninteresting class-book Hopkins has<br />\never had.\"<br />\nAdvertising Manager Merrick reports progress in his work. Business Manager Spencer, however,<br />\nfinds fund collecting rather slow,<br />\nand Editor Short is still smiling<br />\nover some of the \"copy\" which he<br />\nhas received.<br /><br />\nDr. Frank J. Goodnow, president<br />\nof the University, will be the guest<br />\nof honor at the \"dinner meeting\" of<br />\nthe New York Academy of Political Science on Thursday evening at<br />\nthe Astor Hotel in New York. Dr.<br />\nGoodnow was formerly a trustee of<br />\nthe Academy.<br />\nAccording to an announcement<br />\nsent out by the New York alumni<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, the Hopkins men<br />\nwill join the former colleagues of<br />\nDr. Goodnow at Columbia University in taking advantage of the coming dinner to welcome him back<br />\nfrom the Orient and to wish him<br />\nsuccess in his new work in Baltimore. Special tables will be reserved for both Columbia and Hopkins men at the dinner. Among<br />\nthe speakers of the evening will be<br />\nDr. Goodnow, Senator Elihu Root<br /><br />\nPresident Goodnow returned last<br />\nweek from Princeton, where he attended the convention of the Association of American Universities.<br />\nThis Association is an organization of college presidents, or of<br />\ntheir personal representatives, and<br />\nmeets to discuss matters of interest<br />\nto the college world. The meetings<br />\nare rather informal\u2014the object being that of \"getting together\" and<br />\nworking for the standardization of<br />\nstudies and institutions.<br />\nA great deal of discussion was<br />\ngiven to the question of honorary<br />\ndegrees, and to ymethods of awarding fellowships and scholarships.<br />\nEach University has its own particular procedure in these matters,<br />\nand it is recognized by all . that<br />\nsome degree of uniformity should<br />\nbe adopted. What action was taken<br />\nis not known, but the first steps towards a standard have been made.<br />\nPresident Vincent of the University of Minnesota read a paper on<br />\n\"University Publications\"\u2014such as<br />\nwe have here in \"Modern Language<br />\nNotes\" and studies in history and<br />\npolitical science. The best way to<br />\nmanage these was sought, and the<br />\npaper brought out a great deal of<br />\nwholesome discussion. President<br />\nLowell of Harvard presented a<br />\npaper of interest on -The Economy<br />\nof Time.\"<br />\nOne of the most striking developments of the meeting was the<br />\nbringing to notice of the new Western experiments in education, which<br />\nso far have proved able to shorten<br />\nschool and college work by one<br />\nyear, and which are hoped to be<br />\nable to cut at least another year<br />\nfrom the time necessary to complete an education.<br />\n\u2022 The University of Chicago has<br />\nset up a complete school, from the<br />\nearliest stages to the last year of<br />\nhigh school, in connection with<br />\ntheir department of education. In<br />\nthis, it has been found that by coordinating the effort of the pupils,<br />\na year is saved. It is not a system of cramming for college, nor<br />\nare the students overworked. The<br />\nobject is merely to eliminate the<br />\nwaste of time that is sure to occur<br />\nin the education of the average pupil. The results have been highly<br />\nencouraging to the experimenters,<br />\nand they are enthusiastic over the<br />\nidea.<br />\nThe Western institution, the<br />\nJunior College, was fully explained.<br />\nThis is another evolution in education, and aims to do away with the<br />\n\u2022 intermediary. A. B. course which<br />\n\u2022 heretofore has stood between the<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins was defeated by<br />\nHaverford College at Homewood<br />\non Saturday by a score of 10 to o.,<br />\nThis score probably represents the<br />\nrelative merits of the teams as they<br />\nlined up. Without wishing to detract from Haverford's performance and without any apologies for<br />\nHopkins' failure to win, it should<br />\nbe stated that we put a patched up<br />\nteam on the field. If Haverford's<br />\nteam is really as good as claimed<br />\nby its supporters, then we should<br />\nbe well pleased with the work of<br />\nour team on Saturday.<br />\nBarring a long end run by<br />\nHaverford in the first few minutes<br />\nof play, and our failure in the<br />\nearly stages of the game to diagnose a really good delayed forward pass, the teams played pretty<br />\nevenly. Our offence was poor.<br />\nThis was due in part to the fact that<br />\nthe Haverford defence was good,<br />\nand in part to the fact that our back<br />\nfield had never even run signals,<br />\nto say nothing of not having- scrimmaged as a combination. Injuries<br />\nof a minor nature, but sufficiently<br />\nserious to impair their efficiency,<br />\nkept B. Randall and Tischler out<br />\nof the game at the last minute.<br />\nThis, with Captain Wilkinson's<br />\nlameness, rendered effective offensive work out of the question.<br />\nAn offensive campaign requires<br />\nmuch drilling of men. Time for<br />\nthis is not available so we have<br />\nto be content with developing our<br />\nmen in theory only. The results<br />\nare painfully obvious. There is<br />\nsome consolation in the thought<br />\nthat men who do really creditable<br />\nwork with almost no practice would<br />\ndo splendid work if they were<br />\ngiven half a chance.<br />\nIt all comes back to a question<br />\nof time. Football should not be developed at the expense of time<br />\nnecessary for scholastic work. It<br />\nseems to be conceded, however,<br />\nthat some time should be devoted<br />\nto football, and when the day arrives when the time so conceded<br />\nmay be available by daylight and<br />\nnot dark, then we may hope to<br />\nmake some real progress.<br />\nThe season has developed one<br />\nthing certainly, and that is that our<br />\nmen have good stuff in them. That<br />\nthey can and do play determined<br />\nup-hill football against odds which<br />\nare not apparent to the casual on-looker. Even in such defeats as<br />\nhave been experienced this year,<br />\nevery Hopkins man has good reason to be proud of his team. A<br />\nsplendid manly lot of men who<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\nBob Layfield, 'Varsity quarterback, has fought off his second<br />\nsinking spell, and is resting comfortably at Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nHis determination\u2014that which won<br />\nhim his place as quarterback over<br />\na number of other candidates\u2014has<br />\nshown itself in his fight for life.<br />\nFriday night his doctors said death<br />\nwould come shortly, but Bob rallied<br />\nas he had done Tuesday night. For<br />\nthe second time he \"fooled\" his<br />\ndoctors as he said Ile would.<br />\nThey told. Bob his chances for<br />\nrecovery were very slight.<br />\n\"But I'll fool you,\" he said, and<br />\nwhen his nurse returned to the<br />\nroom when the doctor left, Bob told<br />\nher that she must help him fight<br />\nagainst the doctor's verdict.<br />\nWhen he learned that the football schedule probably would be<br />\ncancelled should Ile die, he protested. He sent for his mother at<br />\nonce, and asked her to see that all<br />\ngames were played in spite of his<br />\ncondition, and even should he die.<br />\nwhen his father learned of the request, he too agreed with Bob, and<br />\nthe football management has been<br />\nasked by all three of the Layfields<br />\nto continue through the season.<br />\nIt has been two weeks since the<br />\nLehigh game, in which Layfield sustained the broken backbone, from<br />\nwhich leading doctors at Johns<br />\nHopkins said he would not recover.<br />\nIt is surprising to them that he<br />\nhas lived so long, and friends who<br />\nknow of his pluck and determination see these characteristics making themselves evident in his fight<br />\nto put off the end.<br />\nHe was tired of his milk diet, and<br />\nasked for a change. His doctors<br />\nsaid he might have tea, and Bob<br />\nreplied:<br />\n\"But make it safe-tea first.\"<br />\nOne of his chief delights is to<br />\nshow the visitor his Black and<br />\nBlue sweater with the honorary<br />\n\"H\" that was awarded him at a<br />\nspecial meeting of the Athletic Association.<br />\nThe sweater hangs on the post<br />\nof his bed where he can see it and<br />\npoint it out to his friends. Just beyond is a bank of flowers\u2014tributes<br />\nsent by a number of friends, classes<br />\nand organizations. He has received, too, a great number of letters. Every morning he awaits<br />\neagerly the time when his nurse<br />\nbrings in the mail. The letters are<br />\nread to him, and some are set aside<br />\nfor a second reading.<br />\nMrs. Layfield now spends her<br />\nnights at the bedside of her son,<br />\nas this is the most uncomfortable<br />\npart of his time.<br /><br />\nDR.

I think<br />\nthe chief influence of a University<br />\n.11 as is<br />\nis not in actual study so muc<br />\nin the spirit transmitted by the faculty and associations.<br />\nHopkins has a great name for<br />\nconservatism, and it is the spirit<br />\nof dignity and reserve, of calm<br />\nthoughtfulness and watchful waiting that characterizes and makes<br />\nsuccessful and tolerable the men<br />\nwho go out into the professional<br />\nand business worlds with the label<br />\n\"He is a Hopkins man.\"<br />\nI am proud that I shall be called<br />\na Hopkins man, but I am ashamed<br />\nthat I know so little of Hopkins,<br />\nof Sylvester, Gilman, Lanier and<br />\nthe others of whom you spoke.

Your memorial society is a<br />\nhappy suggestion, and I suggest<br />\nthat some member or members of<br />\nour faculty organize it. I for one<br />\nwill join, and I believe there are<br />\nmany more in the University who<br />\nwould like to take advantage of<br />\nsuch an opportunity to learn of<br />\nHopkins' glories of the past.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nA FRIEND OF YOURS.<br /><br />\ncause the Gettysburg team wore<br /><br />\nlarge numbers sewed on their backs.<br /><br />\nORGANIZATION MEETINGS<br />\nTO BE HELD IN DECEMBER<br /><br />\nWhat person who sat in the stands<br />\nwould not have known the quarterback (No. 8) of the opposition<br />\nwhen the action of play was on the<br />\nother side of the field. No. 8 made<br />\nthe majority of his team's gains,<br />\nbut he would not have been so<br />\nconspicuous had it not been for the<br />\nfact that the Gettysburg players<br />\nwere numbered.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Hopkins team<br />\nwas not numbered, and the result<br />\nwas that whenever a Hopkins player made a sterling play our cheer<br />\nleader was compelled to ask, \"Who<br />\nwas that?\" There were usually<br />\nabout three or four answers given,<br />\nfrom which one name was chosen<br />\nand a cheer given for that player.<br />\nIt is quite difficult to pick out a<br />\nstar player. \"with red hair,\" as the<br />\ntop of a football player's head is<br />\nusually protected by a headgear.<br />\nIt is also difficult to recognize the<br />\nstar everytime, as several men have<br />\nsimilar statures and -several wear<br />\nankle stays. Finally, the majority<br />\nof the spectators do not know the<br />\nHopkins players when they see<br />\nthem and would enjoy the games<br />\nmuch more if the Hopkins men<br />\nwore numbers.<br />\nFor these few reasons I believe<br />\nthat it is advisable for Hopkins to<br />\nget in line with the other big colleges in the country and number<br />\ntheir football players.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nA HOPKINS PROGRESSIVE.<br /><br />\nOrganization meetings of the<br />\ntrack, lacrosse and baseball squads<br />\nwill be held soon after the close<br />\nof the football season; all those<br />\ninterested in Hopkins athletics are<br />\nasked to be present at these meetings.<br />\nThe date for the lacrosse organization has been set for Tuesday,<br />\nDecember 1.
