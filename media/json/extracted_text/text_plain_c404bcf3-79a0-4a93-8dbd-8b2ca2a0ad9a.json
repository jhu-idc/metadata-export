In<br />\nview of the small number of candidates in<br />\nour own State who have taken adva ntage<br />\nof the offer, it would seem that there must<br />\nbe a good deal of ignorance as to just what<br />\nMr. Rhodes' bequest means. Many people<br />\nare asking \"What are the Rhodes' Scholarships What sort of men are the scholars<br />\nWhat kind of a place is Oxford, and what<br />\ndoes it offer to Americans?\" To answer<br />\nthese questions fully would require more<br />\nspace than is at the writer's disposal, and we<br />\ncan only hope to give in the present article<br />\na general idea on each of these points.<br />\nMr. Rhodes' idea when he established the<br />\nscholarships was a very broad one. He<br />\nplanned to gather together young men from<br />\nevery part of the world where there are<br />\nEnglish-speaking people, whether subjects<br />\nof the King or citizens of the United States;<br />\nand he also wished to add to these students<br />\nfrom the German Empire, in order to bring<br />\nthe Germans into closer relations and better<br />\nnnderstanding with their Anglo-Saxon<br />\ncousins. Mr. Rhodes had a firm faith in the<br />\nfuture of the Anglo-Saxons, and believed<br />\nthat the two great branches of that race<br />\ncould, if united (not politically, but by<br />\nmutual sympathy and interest) be a power<br />\nfor good in the world such as has never before existed. Being an Englishman and a<br />\ngraduate of Oriel College, he believed firmly<br />\nin Knglish Institutions and above all in the<br />\neducational system of Oxford. He therefore determined to bring together representatives from the English speaking states in<br />\nevery part of the world, in order that the<br />\nAnglo-Saxons may know their old home and<br />\nits people, and that they in turn may be<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nknown and understood by the men of their<br />\nrace everywhere. With this end in view,<br />\nhe left in his will ten million dollars to endow nearly two hundred scholarships at Oxford ;.fifteen of them are for Germans, seventy-eight for men from the English Colonies,<br />\nand ninety-six for Americans from the<br />\nUnited States. According to this arrangement, one man is appointed from each State<br />\nand Territory in 1904, and another in 1905;<br />\nin the third year there are no appointments,<br />\nand with the fourth the arrangement repeats<br />\nitself. At the last selection of candidates<br />\nevery State sent a candidate except Florida,<br />\nMississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona, and forty-three appointments were<br />\nmade.<br />\nIn one respect at least these forty-three<br />\nyoung men were nearly all alike. Almost all<br />\nof them were Bachelors of Arts from some<br />\nAmerican College, and indeed, not a few were<br />\nM. A.'s. Then, too, almost all were Fraternity men, while several had attained to the<br />\nhonor of wearing a small gold key on their<br />\nwatch fobs. All of them had definitely decided what they were going to do at Oxford;<br />\nsome were anxious to study law, others history or literature; while a few were going<br />\nin for classics and several for modern languages. On the arrival of the party in England, the London Press commented on them<br />\nkindly, if a little sarcastically. The \"Express\" spoke of them as follows:<br />\n\"All are young men, all are scholars, all<br />\nare athletes (it should have said athletic),<br />\nbut they are very American. Eager, sallow,<br />\nbrimming over with enthusiasm, and dressed<br />\nin the free-and-easy style affected by the<br />\nAmerican student, they are likely to cause<br />\na decided stir in the select circles of the<br />\nUniversity on the Isis. It will be long before<br />\nthey attain to the Oxford manner. So pronounced is their nasal twang that their prospects of rising to the Oxford drawl are poor.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThese difficulties have, however, no terrors<br />\nfor the thirty-five. They have other views.\"<br />\nThe \"Daily Telegraph\" had an editorial<br />\non the subject in which it remarked:<br />\n\"The ordinary undergraduate is a little<br />\nastonished to find the scholars are much like<br />\nother Freshmen, instead of being distinguished, as he hoped, by the strangeness of<br />\ntheir attire, the unconventionality of their<br />\nmanners, and a profusion of hirsute adornment in the shape of beards. It would have<br />\nadded much to the picturesqueness of Oxford if these Parthians, Medes and Elamites,<br />\nand dwellers in Mesopotamia had arrived,<br />\nlet us say, like red Indians or Basutos or<br />\nflat-footed Hollanders.\"<br />\nIt has taken the young American some<br />\nlittle time to get used to Oxford, for everything over there was very different from the<br />\nAmerican Colleges from which they came.<br />\nThe reader must recollect that Oxford consists, not of one college, but of twenty-one<br />\ndifferent colleges. The appointees had been<br />\nallowed to decide what college they preferred to enter, and they were provided for<br />\nas nearly as possible in accordance with<br />\nthese expressed preferences. Every college<br />\nreceived two or three of the newcomers,<br />\nOriel, Magdalen, Christ Church, and Brasenose seeming to have been among the most<br />\npopular. The wishes of the new scholars<br />\nwith regard to studies took the authorities<br />\nrather by surprise. They had expected that<br />\nall the men would wish to take the regular<br />\ncollege course, but instead nearly all of them<br />\nwished advanced work; naturally having<br />\ntheir degrees already, they had not come to<br />\nOxford to go over again what they had<br />\nalready learned. But Oxford has different<br />\nideas from ours on the utility of the three<br />\nyears spent in college.<br />\nA much greater<br />\nemphasis is laid on the development of culture and character than on mere knowledge<br />\ngained from books. So much is this so that<br />\nmere residence in the social and intellectual<br />\nenvironment of the University is considered<br />\na matter of prime importance. With us in<br />\nAmerica, men are allowed and even sometimes encouraged to graduate as early as<br />\npossible, and permitted to work over-time<br />\nif by so doing they can graduate \"ahead<br />\nof their class.\" At Oxford one must \"re-<br />\n<br />\nside\" in the college the full number of terms<br />\nprovided for by statute. A man may pass<br />\nall the necessary examinations and yet be<br />\ncompelled to reside on, in perfect idleness,<br />\nso far as doing required work is concerned,<br />\nin order to absorb the full amount of the<br />\nOxford atmosphere. It is for this reason<br />\nthat at Oxford most of the studying is done<br />\nnot in term time, but during the three long<br />\nholidays\u2014two months at Christmas, two at<br />\nEaster, and four in Summer. During the<br />\nfour months of term time a man is expected<br />\nto read with his tutor, and go to the lectures<br />\nwhich his tutor indicates as advisable. The<br />\nrest of his time he divides between athletics<br />\nand social duties, leaving the hard work till<br />\nvacation.<br />\nThe aforementioned tutor is the foundation of the Oxford educational system, which<br />\nthereby differs in another point from the<br />\nAmerican plan. It is by the tutors that the<br />\nmain instruction is carried on. The tutor,<br />\nin America the resort of the backward and<br />\nfeeble-minded, is at the English University,<br />\nthe principal, in fact, the only teacher. He<br />\ntakes hold of his charge's studies, searching<br />\nout his weak points and strengthening them,<br />\nadvises him as to hours and methods of<br />\nstudy, giving him lists of books to read, and<br />\nquestioning him as to the results of his reading. There are lectures, indeed, plenty of<br />\nthem, but attendance on them is not required<br />\nby the University, although the student will<br />\nprobably find it advantageous to go to them.<br />\nExaminations are the one test, and they are<br />\nsevere ones and no man who has not worked<br />\nwell during the term can get through them<br />\ncreditably.<br />\nNo one is in a hurry at Oxford, and the<br />\nnew man may take his time in getting adjusted. The upper classmen are important<br />\nfactors in getting the new corners introduced<br />\ninto the life of the University in the proper<br />\nway. In a manner exactly opposite to the<br />\nmethod in which such things are arranged<br />\nin America, the second year men at Oxford,<br />\nthose who correspond to the Sophomores in<br />\nour colleges, constitute themselves the protectors and friends of the Freshmen. Every<br />\nsecond year man is expected to give a series<br />\nof breakfasts, at which the new men become<br />\nacquainted with their immediate Seniors, and<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwith the men of their own year. And it may<br />\nbe remarked in passing that the wine, whiskey, and tobacco for these and other such<br />\nentertainments are supplied by the College<br />\nauthorities, and the money paid into the<br />\nTreasury. What a sensation such a course<br />\nwould create in this country!<br />\nEveryone at Oxford is expected to go in<br />\nfor some form of athletics as soon as he gets<br />\nthere. Running, rowing, cricket and football are the principal forms it takes. The<br />\nAmericans are, for the most part, learning<br />\nto row; several are playing on the Freshman<br />\nfootball team, and in one college there are<br />\n<br />\nthree Americans on the team. Others are<br />\nat work on the track, where practice goes<br />\nIn a recent<br />\non the whole year round.<br />\nFreshman track meet, eight of the ten events<br />\nwere carried off by Americans\u2014Schutt, of<br />\nCornell, Porter, of Bowdoin, and Young, of<br />\nSouth Dakota.<br />\nAltogether the American<br />\nscholars seem to be having things very much<br />\ntheir own way at Oxford in athletic contests.<br />\nIf they are as good students as athletes,<br />\nAmerica will have reason to be proud of<br />\nthem.<br />\nA. 0.

This trip is<br />\nalways, if not the pleasantest, at least one of<br />\nthe most pleasant of the year; and this<br />\nseason's concert was no exception to the<br />\nrule. The men left Camden Station at four<br />\nP. M. for Washington. The special car was<br />\nthere coupled to another train, and the trip<br />\nwas made to Forest Glen without mishap.<br />\nAfter a quarter of a mile walk across the<br />\nsnowy lawns, the men arrived at the Seminary. They then met the teachers in an informal way, and were given seats of honor<br />\nat the several tables. An excellent dinner<br />\nwas served, at which a mysterious dish called<br />\n\"lady lock\" was perhaps most enjoyed.<br />\nAfter dinner, a reception was held in the<br />\nbeautiful social room of the school. Everyone then adjourned to the theatre, where the<br />\nconcert was to be given. The concert,<br />\nthough good, suffered somewhat through the<br />\nlack of a quartette. Adkins, of the Medial<br />\nSchool, was unable to come out on account<br />\nof a bad cold, and his place could not be<br />\nfilled. Bristol's solos and recitation were,<br />\nas usual, the feature of the evening. After<br />\nthe concert, the men were invited to the<br />\nvarious sorority houses, where they were<br />\nroyally entertained, and from which they<br />\ncould hardly be torn when the time for departure arrived. The train for Washington<br />\nwas very late, but the wait was pleasantly<br />\nspent in singing ('1) certain well-known<br />\nditties, and in rending the night air with frequent \"Hullabaloos.\" Altogether, the trip<br />\nwas successful in every way, and each member of the Club enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />\n<br />\nThe Committee for the Senior Banquet,<br />\nMessrs.

Dr. Willis lectured on the two<br />\ntitles, \"Some Landscapes of China,\"<br />\nand \"My Friends, the Chinese.\" Dr. Davis's<br />\nlectures were on \"A Summer in Turkestan,\"<br />\nand \"The Work of Glaciers.\" Dr. S. Weir<br />\nMitchell delivered an especially interesting<br />\ntalk on January 27. His title was \"A Lecture on Lecturers.\" The audience filled<br />\nMcCoy Hall to the doors, and in fact many<br />\npeople could not gain admision and were<br />\nturned away. On February 2, Dr. Frederick<br />\nKeutgen of the Historical Department lectured on \"The Necessity in America of the<br />\nStudy of the Early History of Modern\u2014.\"<br />\nTwo courses of lectures are to be given<br />\nin the near future. Dr. Frank L. Blake<br />\nwill talk on the Philippine Islands. This<br />\ncourse will be preceded by a short geographical and historical sketch of the Archipelago.<br />\nDr. Keidel will lecture on French Versification.

To the man who appreciates the<br />\nvalue of knowing how to write it will be of<br />\ninterest to know that there exists a vacancy<br />\non the NEws-LETTIm Board.

It teaches a man<br />\nthe value of close observation and accurate<br />\nattention. Were there not something about<br />\nthe 'cussed' thing, though, that makes it<br />\nhard for a man to quit, one year on a paper<br />\nwould be worth two at College.

Lacrosse is, of course, the<br />\ngreat sport at the University. It is the only<br />\ngame, in fact, in which we meet on equal<br />\nterms with the big Northern Colleges. Consequently all the energies of the University<br />\nare exerted to make this team a success, as<br />\ntradition and college spirit demand that it<br />\nshould be. A team on which the University<br />\ndepends for so much and which ranks so high<br />\namong its rivals, should attract the interest<br />\nand hearty support of everyone in the University, student and professor alike. These<br />\narticles by the coach of the team will give<br />\na frank and outspoken view of its skill and<br />\nprogress and will grow more and more valuable as time goes on. Not only, however,<br />\nare they of interest to the University at<br />\nlarge, but they are epecially valuable to the<br />\nplayers themselves, for whom Mr. Schmeisser has written the articles.

From the expressions of approval which followed our first announce:<br />\nment the editors feel sure that the innovation<br />\nwill prove popular. It is the intention of<br />\nthe NEWS-LATTER to review only high-class<br />\nliterature published by reputable firms, and<br />\nto do this in a way which will make the Department of real service to the busy readers<br />\nof the paper. Books upon scientific subjects<br />\nwill be reviewed by students in the departMents under which they come, qualified by<br />\ntraining and experience to criticise intelligently. Many of the leading publishers of<br />\nthe country have offered to furnish books for<br />\nreview and we call them to the attention of<br />\nour friends.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER was pleased last week to<br />\nreceive as an \"exchange\" the first issue of<br />\n\"Old Maryland,'3 a monthly just started by<br />\nthe University of Maryland. Our first impression of \"Old Maryland\" is distinctly a<br />\nfavorable one, which we trust will improve<br />\nwith fuller acquaintance. The paper is well<br />\nconceived, well written, and full of news,<br />\nand we compliment the editors upon their<br />\nfirst effort.<br />\nThis issue of the NEws-LETTa makes its<br />\nappearance over ten days late. A series of<br />\nmishaps, culminating last week in a serious<br />\naccident to the printing establishment at<br />\nwhich the presswork of this paper is done,<br />\ncombined to cause the delay. Under the<br />\ncircumstances, the editors feel inclined to<br />\ncongratulate themselves upon getting the<br />\npaper out so soon. There is a tradition connected with the N4WS-LETTER that in every<br />\nyear there is a \"Jonah\" issue. This issue<br />\nis our \"Jonah.\"<br />\n\"You say he's color-blind?\"<br />\n\"Yes; he took Dr. Greene's course when<br />\nhe might have taken Dr. Brown's.\"<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nTHE PROPHET IN HIS OWN<br />\nCOUNTRY.<br />\nIt is surprising how little is known of the<br />\nHopkins right here in Baltimore. The great<br />\nmajority of the people you meet on the<br />\nstreet can direct you to the Hospital, but<br />\nfew are aware of the presence of the University; that is, comparatively few. A Harvard man was in Baltimore not long ago,<br />\nand tells this story:<br />\n\"I happened to be passing through Baltimore, and it occurred to me that as I had a<br />\nday at my disposal I couldn't do better than<br />\nsee something of the great American University of which I had heard so much. Moreover, I had a friend here who is a graduate<br />\nstudent in chemistry, and I thought I'd look<br />\nhim up and make him show me through the<br />\nHopkins. At Union Station I inquired how<br />\nto get to the Hopkins, and, following my<br />\ndirections, I soon arrived at. Broadway.<br />\nThere I found, of course, the Medical School<br />\nand learned for the first time that the University proper was situated across town at<br />\na distance of a mile or more. I was told,<br />\nhowever, how to reach it. When I got off<br />\nthe Madison Avenue car at Monument St.<br />\nI looked around and saw some large buildings, but to make sure that they housed the<br />\nUniversity, I stepped into the cigar store<br />\nnext door to what I now know to be Levering Hall. 'Will you tell me,' I asked, 'in<br />\nwhich one of these buildings the Chemical<br />\nLaboratory of the University is to be found?'<br />\n\"'Why,' said my Baltimore friend,'what<br />\nUniversity do you mean?\"The Hopkins,'<br />\nI replied. 'Oh, the Johns Hopkins\u2014well,<br />\nthat's around here somewhere, but I am<br />\nsorry I can't tell you exactly where.'<br />\n\"Well,\" continued the Harvard man, \"to<br />\nmake a long story short I found my friend<br />\nand he showed me through your various<br />\nlaboratories and libraries, and I had some<br />\nof your big men pointed out to me and also<br />\nhad the pleasure of meeting two of them.<br />\nI was very much impressed, I'll admit, but<br />\nthe thing that I'll never forget and can't<br />\nunderstand, is how the cigar man did not<br />\nknow, though he lived next door to it, where<br />\nthe University was.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe Progress of the Lacrosse Team.<br />\nIt has been about six weeks since the last<br />\nreport of the progress of the men trying for<br />\nour lacrosse team has appeared in the colDuring this<br />\numns of the INNWS-LETTER.<br />\ngoing on,<br />\nbeen<br />\nhas<br />\nwork<br />\ngood<br />\ninterval the<br />\n\"standold<br />\nthe<br />\nby<br />\ninterest<br />\nwatched with<br />\nthings<br />\nsay<br />\ngallery,<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\nbys\" who, seated<br />\nmade<br />\nis<br />\nplay<br />\nbad<br />\na<br />\nwhen<br />\nbreath<br />\nunder their<br />\nteamHopkins<br />\nof<br />\nbit<br />\na<br />\nwhen<br />\nand applaud<br />\nwork becomes apparent.<br />\nThe coaches are still working on this difficult problem: given the material in hand,<br />\nwhat is the combination that will make the<br />\nchampionship team of 1905? Each man has<br />\nbeen shifted from place to place so as to be<br />\ngiven an opportunity to display any inherent<br />\nqualities which he may have peculiar to a<br />\ncertain position. When the man or group<br />\nof men best suited for each respective position has been found, the coaches will pick<br />\nout the faults of the player and try to eradicate them.<br />\nNever before have so many men, trying<br />\nfor the team, played with such equal ability;<br />\nnevertheless, the coaches feel safe in predicting that the team will be picked from the<br />\nfollowing players: Captain Dill, FIlanck,<br />\nStrobhar, Meyer, Morse, Hudgins, H. Smith,<br />\nChambers, Bryan, Shakelford, Erlanger,<br />\nMengel, Knipp, Tough, MacSherry, W.<br />\nBlank, Hartman, Armstrong, Pease, Raleigh,<br />\nH. Schrneisser, Holland and Iglehart.<br />\nSince the scope of this report will not<br />\nallow a detailed criticism of each player, a<br />\nfew general remarks will have to suffice.<br />\nThe players left over from last year have<br />\n<br />\nlost none of their cunningness; but are not<br />\nat present playing a steady game. Their<br />\nstickwork is not as sure as it ought to be,<br />\nno doubt often due to the bad light in the<br />\ncage. Much the same may be said of those<br />\nmen who played on the scrub last year, only<br />\ntheir ability to do the right thing at the<br />\nright time, or a lack of scientific knowledge<br />\nof the game is their additional weakness.<br />\nAs for the freshmen, they have been making<br />\nfine progress; they have learned much of the<br />\ngame in the last six weeks, but they have<br />\nyet many a mile to travel before they will<br />\nbegin to fill the place of a man with three<br />\nor four years' experience. Their principal<br />\nstumbling block is \"stickwork ;\" no man can<br />\nplay a good game of lacrosse if he is compelled to think about the ball after he<br />\ntouches it with his stick.<br />\nIn conclusion the writer will say that it<br />\nis the opinion of the coaches that from a<br />\nphysical point of view, we have better material for a team this year than last. The<br />\nmen are heavier, faster, and ought to be<br />\nable to stand more work. Now, is it possible<br />\nfor this rather raw team to take on that<br />\nstickwork and team-work which have been<br />\nthe greatest factors in Hopkins' success in<br />\nthe past? It can, but only by each player<br />\nmaking an exact study of where his partners wish to have the ball passed and putting<br />\nit there. This careful \"stickwork\" practice may be tedious to some men, but it is<br />\nthe only sure road to success. If we want<br />\na great team this year we must have team- \u2022<br />\nwork.<br />\nWm. C. Schmeisser.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 20; U. of M., 8.<br />\nFive hundred persons witnessed the initial<br />\nperformance of Hopkins upon the basketball field, on the evening of Saturday, Jan.<br />\n21 ,when our valiant quintet played the University of Maryland in the Hopkins cage.<br />\nThat same five hundred soon realized that<br />\nlacrosse and football not alone offered us<br />\nunbounded possibilities, when we defeated<br />\nthe Black and Red team to the tune of 20-8.<br />\nIt had been specially announced throughout the University that the evening was to<br />\nbe a social event, and the claim was justified<br />\nby the brilliant audience that witnessed the<br />\ngame. Some of the season's fairest debutantes adorned the otherwise unimposing<br />\ngallery of the cage and patches of Black<br />\nand Blue on their dresses, showed plainly<br />\nthat our men had loyal sympathizers among<br />\nBaltimore's fairest.<br />\nPresident and Mrs.<br />\nRemsen occupied a central position in the<br />\nfront row of the gallery, and other members<br />\nof the faculty also lent their encouragement.<br />\nPromptly at 8.30 the Maryland team<br />\ntrotted out on the field to the hospitable<br />\napplause of our rooters and the encouragements of their own following. They engaged in a brief practice, and it was immediately remarked, that, while they outweighed our men, they lacked team work.<br />\nFive minutes later a rousing \"Hullabaloo\"<br />\ngreeted our team.<br />\nThe toss-up gave us the south goal, and<br />\nquickly the two teams lined up. After a<br />\nfew anxious moments of suspense, Referee<br />\nKistler sounded the whistle, and the battle<br />\nbegan which was to decide our chances at<br />\nthe new game. The first encouragement<br />\nwas remarked in the fact that our centre,<br />\nHelmholtz, had been well placed, for with<br />\nremarkable precision he sent the ball to<br />\nHolmes. After the first few moments, required for the individual opponents to size<br />\nup each other, it gradually became apparent<br />\nthat our better team work was going to give<br />\nus unexpected chances. The game put up<br />\nby the Maryland boys, while not lacking in.<br />\nardor, was disappointing from the frequency<br />\nwith which their players fouled.<br />\nThese<br />\nfouls were made more conspicuous by the<br />\naccuracy with which we took advantage of<br />\nthem in getting goals from the foul line.<br />\nWithin the first five minutes Holmes had<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nthrice filled the basket on foul goals. Then<br />\nfor a short while Maryland turned the tables<br />\non us and secured two foul goals. It would<br />\nbe impossible to decribe in detail the plays<br />\nthat followed. Suffice it to say that we<br />\nshowed throughout the game superior team<br />\nwork and goal throwing. McClure threw<br />\ntwo field goals in the first half and Holmes<br />\nadded another to the score, together with<br />\nthree more foul goals.<br />\nThe second half showed for a while a<br />\nchange for the better in Maryland's playing,<br />\nbut the change was short-lived. Five more<br />\nfoul goals and one field goal were scored by<br />\nHolmes, while Helmholtz threw the fifth one.<br />\nMaryland succeeded in placing two field<br />\ngoals and two more foul goals to her credit,<br />\nand the game ended with the score 20-8.<br />\nThe feature of the game was the extreme<br />\naccuracy displayed by Captain Holmes in<br />\nthrowing goal from the foul line. Out of<br />\nthe fifteen chances offered him he succeeded<br />\nin ten. Maryland threw four foul goals out<br />\nof the fourteen chances offered. The strong<br />\ndefense work of Strobar and McClure also<br />\ndeserves special mention.<br />\nOur line-up was as follows: Helmholtz,<br />\nc; Holmes (Capt.), r. f.; Holden\u2014Blanck,<br />\nI. f.; McClure, r. d.; Strobar, 1. d.<br />\n<br />\nPENN., 42; HOPKINS, 13.<br />\nBefore a large and enthusiastic audience<br />\nHopkins went down to defeat last Friday<br />\nnight in what was undoubtedly the most important game of basket ball which the University has played this season. I say enthusiastic; yes, for the friends of both teams,<br />\nHopkins and Penn, were out in full force,<br />\nand yelled lustily for their respective favorites. But some of the friends of the Black<br />\nand Blue were not so enthusiastic, for to play<br />\nand defeat Dickinson is one thing; and to<br />\ntackle old Penn is another, for it must be<br />\nremembered that Penn's basket ball team is<br />\nscarcely excelled by any in the country, unless it be Columbia's.<br />\nIt is not to be expected that such a new<br />\naggregation of players as Hopkins has can<br />\nsuccessfully cope with such old veterans as<br />\nPenn; and although Hopkins lost the game,<br />\nit is to our great credit that we scored<br />\nat all.<br />\nShortly after the game started it became<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\napparent that Hopkins was utterly outclassed. Our team work could not possibly<br />\nequal that of our opponents, which was almost perfect, for no matter where the ball<br />\nwas sent, it nearly always landed in Penn's<br />\nhands. Penn's long passes were the features<br />\nof the game; and their team work and speed<br />\nwill long be remembered. Most of Hopkins'<br />\ngoals were made from the foul, and while<br />\nthe visitors made their 42 goals almost at<br />\nwill, the locals found opportunity to pile up<br />\n13 for themselves.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nJ.

There was a large and enthusiastic attendance; the events were well<br />\ncontested; and, what is more important to<br />\nthe Hopkins student, the University won the<br />\nmeet by a good margin. The failure to obtain a worthy opponent for the relay team<br />\nwas the cause of much disappointment; but<br />\nthe disappointment was somewhat lessened<br />\nby the excellent work of the Hopkins men<br />\nin the individual events. Entered in seven<br />\nevents, they won three firsts, five seconds and<br />\none third, making a total of 31 points out of<br />\na possible 63.<br />\nThe events were run off with a promptness which reflects great credit upon the<br />\nofficials. Hill won the open thirty yard dash<br />\nby a very small margin from Walker of<br />\nGeorgetown. In the quarter, Gilbert ran<br />\nsecond to Randall, M. A. C., who, as usual,<br />\nwon; and Hunter was beaten out by Lorando, G. U., by a yard for third place.<br />\nStewart put up a splendid fight for first in<br />\nthe half, but was beaten out by Lorando in<br />\nthe same time in which the latter won the<br />\nevent last year. Boyce, J. H. U., was third.<br />\nHopkins did not place in the high jump;<br />\nbut took both first and second in the shot put.<br />\nThe prettiest race of the evening was,<br />\n<br />\nwithout doubt, the mile. Breyer, B. C. C.,<br />\nset a fast pace from the start. At the fifteenth, lap Morse passed him with some difficulty and held the lead until the last lap<br />\nwhen Griffith, who had been quietly holding<br />\nthird, made a beautiful sprint and won by<br />\nabout 10 yards.<br />\nThe surprise of the evening came in the<br />\nbroad jump. Davis, of the City College, beat<br />\nHill by about nine inches. Hill's best jump<br />\nwas 21 ft. 8 in., while Davis jumped 22 ft.<br />\n51/2 in. Hill's jump was far below his usual<br />\nmark; his failure was probably due to overconfidence, as he missed the take-off several<br />\ntimes.<br />\nThe inter-scholastic events and the relay<br />\nraces were close and interesting, and good<br />\nmarks were made in all, especially the 30yard dash, in which the time was one-fifth<br />\nof a second faster than that of the open dash.<br />\nThe only fault to be found with the meet<br />\nis one which the officials were, perhaps, unable to prevent: the crowding of the spectators on the field. The only persons who had<br />\na right on the field were the athletes, the<br />\nofficials, and the spectators who held seats<br />\non the grounds; nevertheless there were<br />\nabout three times as many people crowded<br />\non the field. The contestants in both the<br />\nbroad jump and pole vault were hindered<br />\nby the crowds, and at the next meet some<br />\nremedy should be found for this evil.<br />\nThe following is a summary of events of<br />\nspecial interest to Hopkins men:<br />\n30-yard Dash (open).

It is astonishing upon<br />\nreading the book to find how much of one's<br />\nconception of the great Corsican belongs to<br />\nthe realm of pure fancy. The story does not<br />\npretend to be exhaustive, but the light it<br />\nsheds upon the character and motives of<br />\nthe real Napoleon make it valuable, while<br />\nthe easy style of the writer renders it delightful reading.<br />\nNot the least interesting part of the volume is a reprint of the famous satire of Jean<br />\nBaptiste Peres, published in 1827.<br />\nThis<br />\nsatire, one of the best ever written in any<br />\nlanguage, was intended as an attack upon<br />\nthe scepticism of the age in which it was<br />\npublished, and was directed more especially<br />\nat the teachings of M.

In<br />\nview of the small number of candidates in<br />\nour own State who have taken adva ntage<br />\nof the offer, it would seem that there must<br />\nbe a good deal of ignorance as to just what<br />\nMr. Rhodes' bequest means. Many people<br />\nare asking \"What are the Rhodes' Scholarships What sort of men are the scholars<br />\nWhat kind of a place is Oxford, and what<br />\ndoes it offer to Americans?\" To answer<br />\nthese questions fully would require more<br />\nspace than is at the writer's disposal, and we<br />\ncan only hope to give in the present article<br />\na general idea on each of these points.<br />\nMr. Rhodes' idea when he established the<br />\nscholarships was a very broad one. He<br />\nplanned to gather together young men from<br />\nevery part of the world where there are<br />\nEnglish-speaking people, whether subjects<br />\nof the King or citizens of the United States;<br />\nand he also wished to add to these students<br />\nfrom the German Empire, in order to bring<br />\nthe Germans into closer relations and better<br />\nnnderstanding with their Anglo-Saxon<br />\ncousins. Mr. Rhodes had a firm faith in the<br />\nfuture of the Anglo-Saxons, and believed<br />\nthat the two great branches of that race<br />\ncould, if united (not politically, but by<br />\nmutual sympathy and interest) be a power<br />\nfor good in the world such as has never before existed. Being an Englishman and a<br />\ngraduate of Oriel College, he believed firmly<br />\nin Knglish Institutions and above all in the<br />\neducational system of Oxford. He therefore determined to bring together representatives from the English speaking states in<br />\nevery part of the world, in order that the<br />\nAnglo-Saxons may know their old home and<br />\nits people, and that they in turn may be<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nknown and understood by the men of their<br />\nrace everywhere. With this end in view,<br />\nhe left in his will ten million dollars to endow nearly two hundred scholarships at Oxford ;.fifteen of them are for Germans, seventy-eight for men from the English Colonies,<br />\nand ninety-six for Americans from the<br />\nUnited States. According to this arrangement, one man is appointed from each State<br />\nand Territory in 1904, and another in 1905;<br />\nin the third year there are no appointments,<br />\nand with the fourth the arrangement repeats<br />\nitself. At the last selection of candidates<br />\nevery State sent a candidate except Florida,<br />\nMississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona, and forty-three appointments were<br />\nmade.<br />\nIn one respect at least these forty-three<br />\nyoung men were nearly all alike. Almost all<br />\nof them were Bachelors of Arts from some<br />\nAmerican College, and indeed, not a few were<br />\nM. A.'s. Then, too, almost all were Fraternity men, while several had attained to the<br />\nhonor of wearing a small gold key on their<br />\nwatch fobs. All of them had definitely decided what they were going to do at Oxford;<br />\nsome were anxious to study law, others history or literature; while a few were going<br />\nin for classics and several for modern languages. On the arrival of the party in England, the London Press commented on them<br />\nkindly, if a little sarcastically. The \"Express\" spoke of them as follows:<br />\n\"All are young men, all are scholars, all<br />\nare athletes (it should have said athletic),<br />\nbut they are very American. Eager, sallow,<br />\nbrimming over with enthusiasm, and dressed<br />\nin the free-and-easy style affected by the<br />\nAmerican student, they are likely to cause<br />\na decided stir in the select circles of the<br />\nUniversity on the Isis. It will be long before<br />\nthey attain to the Oxford manner. So pronounced is their nasal twang that their prospects of rising to the Oxford drawl are poor.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThese difficulties have, however, no terrors<br />\nfor the thirty-five. They have other views.\"<br />\nThe \"Daily Telegraph\" had an editorial<br />\non the subject in which it remarked:<br />\n\"The ordinary undergraduate is a little<br />\nastonished to find the scholars are much like<br />\nother Freshmen, instead of being distinguished, as he hoped, by the strangeness of<br />\ntheir attire, the unconventionality of their<br />\nmanners, and a profusion of hirsute adornment in the shape of beards. It would have<br />\nadded much to the picturesqueness of Oxford if these Parthians, Medes and Elamites,<br />\nand dwellers in Mesopotamia had arrived,<br />\nlet us say, like red Indians or Basutos or<br />\nflat-footed Hollanders.\"<br />\nIt has taken the young American some<br />\nlittle time to get used to Oxford, for everything over there was very different from the<br />\nAmerican Colleges from which they came.<br />\nThe reader must recollect that Oxford consists, not of one college, but of twenty-one<br />\ndifferent colleges. The appointees had been<br />\nallowed to decide what college they preferred to enter, and they were provided for<br />\nas nearly as possible in accordance with<br />\nthese expressed preferences. Every college<br />\nreceived two or three of the newcomers,<br />\nOriel, Magdalen, Christ Church, and Brasenose seeming to have been among the most<br />\npopular. The wishes of the new scholars<br />\nwith regard to studies took the authorities<br />\nrather by surprise. They had expected that<br />\nall the men would wish to take the regular<br />\ncollege course, but instead nearly all of them<br />\nwished advanced work; naturally having<br />\ntheir degrees already, they had not come to<br />\nOxford to go over again what they had<br />\nalready learned. But Oxford has different<br />\nideas from ours on the utility of the three<br />\nyears spent in college.<br />\nA much greater<br />\nemphasis is laid on the development of culture and character than on mere knowledge<br />\ngained from books. So much is this so that<br />\nmere residence in the social and intellectual<br />\nenvironment of the University is considered<br />\na matter of prime importance. With us in<br />\nAmerica, men are allowed and even sometimes encouraged to graduate as early as<br />\npossible, and permitted to work over-time<br />\nif by so doing they can graduate \"ahead<br />\nof their class.\" At Oxford one must \"re-<br /><br />\nside\" in the college the full number of terms<br />\nprovided for by statute. A man may pass<br />\nall the necessary examinations and yet be<br />\ncompelled to reside on, in perfect idleness,<br />\nso far as doing required work is concerned,<br />\nin order to absorb the full amount of the<br />\nOxford atmosphere. It is for this reason<br />\nthat at Oxford most of the studying is done<br />\nnot in term time, but during the three long<br />\nholidays\u2014two months at Christmas, two at<br />\nEaster, and four in Summer. During the<br />\nfour months of term time a man is expected<br />\nto read with his tutor, and go to the lectures<br />\nwhich his tutor indicates as advisable. The<br />\nrest of his time he divides between athletics<br />\nand social duties, leaving the hard work till<br />\nvacation.<br />\nThe aforementioned tutor is the foundation of the Oxford educational system, which<br />\nthereby differs in another point from the<br />\nAmerican plan. It is by the tutors that the<br />\nmain instruction is carried on. The tutor,<br />\nin America the resort of the backward and<br />\nfeeble-minded, is at the English University,<br />\nthe principal, in fact, the only teacher. He<br />\ntakes hold of his charge's studies, searching<br />\nout his weak points and strengthening them,<br />\nadvises him as to hours and methods of<br />\nstudy, giving him lists of books to read, and<br />\nquestioning him as to the results of his reading. There are lectures, indeed, plenty of<br />\nthem, but attendance on them is not required<br />\nby the University, although the student will<br />\nprobably find it advantageous to go to them.<br />\nExaminations are the one test, and they are<br />\nsevere ones and no man who has not worked<br />\nwell during the term can get through them<br />\ncreditably.<br />\nNo one is in a hurry at Oxford, and the<br />\nnew man may take his time in getting adjusted. The upper classmen are important<br />\nfactors in getting the new corners introduced<br />\ninto the life of the University in the proper<br />\nway. In a manner exactly opposite to the<br />\nmethod in which such things are arranged<br />\nin America, the second year men at Oxford,<br />\nthose who correspond to the Sophomores in<br />\nour colleges, constitute themselves the protectors and friends of the Freshmen. Every<br />\nsecond year man is expected to give a series<br />\nof breakfasts, at which the new men become<br />\nacquainted with their immediate Seniors, and<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwith the men of their own year. And it may<br />\nbe remarked in passing that the wine, whiskey, and tobacco for these and other such<br />\nentertainments are supplied by the College<br />\nauthorities, and the money paid into the<br />\nTreasury. What a sensation such a course<br />\nwould create in this country!<br />\nEveryone at Oxford is expected to go in<br />\nfor some form of athletics as soon as he gets<br />\nthere. Running, rowing, cricket and football are the principal forms it takes. The<br />\nAmericans are, for the most part, learning<br />\nto row; several are playing on the Freshman<br />\nfootball team, and in one college there are<br /><br />\nthree Americans on the team. Others are<br />\nat work on the track, where practice goes<br />\nIn a recent<br />\non the whole year round.<br />\nFreshman track meet, eight of the ten events<br />\nwere carried off by Americans\u2014Schutt, of<br />\nCornell, Porter, of Bowdoin, and Young, of<br />\nSouth Dakota.<br />\nAltogether the American<br />\nscholars seem to be having things very much<br />\ntheir own way at Oxford in athletic contests.<br />\nIf they are as good students as athletes,<br />\nAmerica will have reason to be proud of<br />\nthem.<br />\nA. 0.

This trip is<br />\nalways, if not the pleasantest, at least one of<br />\nthe most pleasant of the year; and this<br />\nseason's concert was no exception to the<br />\nrule. The men left Camden Station at four<br />\nP. M. for Washington. The special car was<br />\nthere coupled to another train, and the trip<br />\nwas made to Forest Glen without mishap.<br />\nAfter a quarter of a mile walk across the<br />\nsnowy lawns, the men arrived at the Seminary. They then met the teachers in an informal way, and were given seats of honor<br />\nat the several tables. An excellent dinner<br />\nwas served, at which a mysterious dish called<br />\n\"lady lock\" was perhaps most enjoyed.<br />\nAfter dinner, a reception was held in the<br />\nbeautiful social room of the school. Everyone then adjourned to the theatre, where the<br />\nconcert was to be given. The concert,<br />\nthough good, suffered somewhat through the<br />\nlack of a quartette. Adkins, of the Medial<br />\nSchool, was unable to come out on account<br />\nof a bad cold, and his place could not be<br />\nfilled. Bristol's solos and recitation were,<br />\nas usual, the feature of the evening. After<br />\nthe concert, the men were invited to the<br />\nvarious sorority houses, where they were<br />\nroyally entertained, and from which they<br />\ncould hardly be torn when the time for departure arrived. The train for Washington<br />\nwas very late, but the wait was pleasantly<br />\nspent in singing ('1) certain well-known<br />\nditties, and in rending the night air with frequent \"Hullabaloos.\" Altogether, the trip<br />\nwas successful in every way, and each member of the Club enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />\nThe Committee for the Senior Banquet,<br />\nMessrs.

Dr. Willis lectured on the two<br />\ntitles, \"Some Landscapes of China,\"<br />\nand \"My Friends, the Chinese.\" Dr. Davis's<br />\nlectures were on \"A Summer in Turkestan,\"<br />\nand \"The Work of Glaciers.\" Dr. S. Weir<br />\nMitchell delivered an especially interesting<br />\ntalk on January 27. His title was \"A Lecture on Lecturers.\" The audience filled<br />\nMcCoy Hall to the doors, and in fact many<br />\npeople could not gain admision and were<br />\nturned away. On February 2, Dr. Frederick<br />\nKeutgen of the Historical Department lectured on \"The Necessity in America of the<br />\nStudy of the Early History of Modern\u2014.\"<br />\nTwo courses of lectures are to be given<br />\nin the near future.

To the man who appreciates the<br />\nvalue of knowing how to write it will be of<br />\ninterest to know that there exists a vacancy<br />\non the NEws-LETTIm Board. The man<br />\nwho succeeds in winning the position<br />\non its staff will learn a little something of<br />\nthe art of writing in the only way the power<br />\nto write is acquired, which is by writing.<br />\nMoreover, he gets something of the training<br />\nwhich John Fox so heartily recommends\u2014<br />\nand considers of such great value.<br /><br />\nIn talking about journalism as a profession, John Fox, Jr., the novelist and war<br />\ncorrespondent, said to one of the editors of<br />\nthis paper: \"There is nothing like a year<br />\nor two on a newspaper. It teaches a man<br />\nthe value of close observation and accurate<br />\nattention. Were there not something about<br />\nthe 'cussed' thing, though, that makes it<br />\nhard for a man to quit, one year on a paper<br />\nwould be worth two at College. In fact,<br />\nI think it is anyhow.\"<br />\nIn this America of ours we are in such a<br />\nhurry to get through one thing in order that<br />\nwe may get at another that what John Fox<br />\nsays may appear, and to the average man<br />\ndoubtless is, impracticable.

The<br />\nNtws-LETTER is sure that the article will<br />\nbe read with interest by all those who are<br />\ninterested in the development of the team,<br />\nin which number, we trust, the whole University is included, and not simply those directly concerned. Lacrosse is, of course, the<br />\ngreat sport at the University. It is the only<br />\ngame, in fact, in which we meet on equal<br />\nterms with the big Northern Colleges. Consequently all the energies of the University<br />\nare exerted to make this team a success, as<br />\ntradition and college spirit demand that it<br />\nshould be. A team on which the University<br />\ndepends for so much and which ranks so high<br />\namong its rivals, should attract the interest<br />\nand hearty support of everyone in the University, student and professor alike. These<br />\narticles by the coach of the team will give<br />\na frank and outspoken view of its skill and<br />\nprogress and will grow more and more valuable as time goes on. Not only, however,<br />\nare they of interest to the University at<br />\nlarge, but they are epecially valuable to the<br />\nplayers themselves, for whom Mr. Schmeisser has written the articles.

It is the intention of<br />\nthe NEWS-LATTER to review only high-class<br />\nliterature published by reputable firms, and<br />\nto do this in a way which will make the Department of real service to the busy readers<br />\nof the paper.

Many of the leading publishers of<br />\nthe country have offered to furnish books for<br />\nreview and we call them to the attention of<br />\nour friends.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER was pleased last week to<br />\nreceive as an \"exchange\" the first issue of<br />\n\"Old Maryland,'3 a monthly just started by<br />\nthe University of Maryland. Our first impression of \"Old Maryland\" is distinctly a<br />\nfavorable one, which we trust will improve<br />\nwith fuller acquaintance.

A series of<br />\nmishaps, culminating last week in a serious<br />\naccident to the printing establishment at<br />\nwhich the presswork of this paper is done,<br />\ncombined to cause the delay. Under the<br />\ncircumstances, the editors feel inclined to<br />\ncongratulate themselves upon getting the<br />\npaper out so soon.

The great<br />\nmajority of the people you meet on the<br />\nstreet can direct you to the Hospital, but<br />\nfew are aware of the presence of the University; that is, comparatively few. A Harvard man was in Baltimore not long ago,<br />\nand tells this story:<br />\n\"I happened to be passing through Baltimore, and it occurred to me that as I had a<br />\nday at my disposal I couldn't do better than<br />\nsee something of the great American University of which I had heard so much. Moreover, I had a friend here who is a graduate<br />\nstudent in chemistry, and I thought I'd look<br />\nhim up and make him show me through the<br />\nHopkins. At Union Station I inquired how<br />\nto get to the Hopkins, and, following my<br />\ndirections, I soon arrived at. Broadway.<br />\nThere I found, of course, the Medical School<br />\nand learned for the first time that the University proper was situated across town at<br />\na distance of a mile or more. I was told,<br />\nhowever, how to reach it. When I got off<br />\nthe Madison Avenue car at Monument St.<br />\nI looked around and saw some large buildings, but to make sure that they housed the<br />\nUniversity, I stepped into the cigar store<br />\nnext door to what I now know to be Levering Hall. 'Will you tell me,' I asked, 'in<br />\nwhich one of these buildings the Chemical<br />\nLaboratory of the University is to be found?'<br />\n\"'Why,' said my Baltimore friend,'what<br />\nUniversity do you mean?\"The Hopkins,'<br />\nI replied. 'Oh, the Johns Hopkins\u2014well,<br />\nthat's around here somewhere, but I am<br />\nsorry I can't tell you exactly where.'<br />\n\"Well,\" continued the Harvard man, \"to<br />\nmake a long story short I found my friend<br />\nand he showed me through your various<br />\nlaboratories and libraries, and I had some<br />\nof your big men pointed out to me and also<br />\nhad the pleasure of meeting two of them.<br />\nI was very much impressed, I'll admit, but<br />\nthe thing that I'll never forget and can't<br />\nunderstand, is how the cigar man did not<br />\nknow, though he lived next door to it, where<br />\nthe University was.\"<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe Progress of the Lacrosse Team.<br />\nIt has been about six weeks since the last<br />\nreport of the progress of the men trying for<br />\nour lacrosse team has appeared in the colDuring this<br />\numns of the INNWS-LETTER.<br />\ngoing on,<br />\nbeen<br />\nhas<br />\nwork<br />\ngood<br />\ninterval the<br />\n\"standold<br />\nthe<br />\nby<br />\ninterest<br />\nwatched with<br />\nthings<br />\nsay<br />\ngallery,<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\nbys\" who, seated<br />\nmade<br />\nis<br />\nplay<br />\nbad<br />\na<br />\nwhen<br />\nbreath<br />\nunder their<br />\nteamHopkins<br />\nof<br />\nbit<br />\na<br />\nwhen<br />\nand applaud<br />\nwork becomes apparent.<br />\nThe coaches are still working on this difficult problem: given the material in hand,<br />\nwhat is the combination that will make the<br />\nchampionship team of 1905? Each man has<br />\nbeen shifted from place to place so as to be<br />\ngiven an opportunity to display any inherent<br />\nqualities which he may have peculiar to a<br />\ncertain position. When the man or group<br />\nof men best suited for each respective position has been found, the coaches will pick<br />\nout the faults of the player and try to eradicate them.<br />\nNever before have so many men, trying<br />\nfor the team, played with such equal ability;<br />\nnevertheless, the coaches feel safe in predicting that the team will be picked from the<br />\nfollowing players: Captain Dill, FIlanck,<br />\nStrobhar, Meyer, Morse, Hudgins, H. Smith,<br />\nChambers, Bryan, Shakelford, Erlanger,<br />\nMengel, Knipp, Tough, MacSherry, W.<br />\nBlank, Hartman, Armstrong, Pease, Raleigh,<br />\nH. Schrneisser, Holland and Iglehart.<br />\nSince the scope of this report will not<br />\nallow a detailed criticism of each player, a<br />\nfew general remarks will have to suffice.<br />\nThe players left over from last year have<br /><br />\nlost none of their cunningness; but are not<br />\nat present playing a steady game. Their<br />\nstickwork is not as sure as it ought to be,<br />\nno doubt often due to the bad light in the<br />\ncage. Much the same may be said of those<br />\nmen who played on the scrub last year, only<br />\ntheir ability to do the right thing at the<br />\nright time, or a lack of scientific knowledge<br />\nof the game is their additional weakness.<br />\nAs for the freshmen, they have been making<br />\nfine progress; they have learned much of the<br />\ngame in the last six weeks, but they have<br />\nyet many a mile to travel before they will<br />\nbegin to fill the place of a man with three<br />\nor four years' experience. Their principal<br />\nstumbling block is \"stickwork ;\" no man can<br />\nplay a good game of lacrosse if he is compelled to think about the ball after he<br />\ntouches it with his stick.<br />\nIn conclusion the writer will say that it<br />\nis the opinion of the coaches that from a<br />\nphysical point of view, we have better material for a team this year than last. The<br />\nmen are heavier, faster, and ought to be<br />\nable to stand more work. Now, is it possible<br />\nfor this rather raw team to take on that<br />\nstickwork and team-work which have been<br />\nthe greatest factors in Hopkins' success in<br />\nthe past? It can, but only by each player<br />\nmaking an exact study of where his partners wish to have the ball passed and putting<br />\nit there. This careful \"stickwork\" practice may be tedious to some men, but it is<br />\nthe only sure road to success. If we want<br />\na great team this year we must have team- \u2022<br />\nwork.<br />\nWm. C.

Some of the season's fairest debutantes adorned the otherwise unimposing<br />\ngallery of the cage and patches of Black<br />\nand Blue on their dresses, showed plainly<br />\nthat our men had loyal sympathizers among<br />\nBaltimore's fairest.<br />\nPresident and Mrs.<br />\nRemsen occupied a central position in the<br />\nfront row of the gallery, and other members<br />\nof the faculty also lent their encouragement.<br />\nPromptly at 8.30 the Maryland team<br />\ntrotted out on the field to the hospitable<br />\napplause of our rooters and the encouragements of their own following. They engaged in a brief practice, and it was immediately remarked, that, while they outweighed our men, they lacked team work.<br />\nFive minutes later a rousing \"Hullabaloo\"<br />\ngreeted our team.<br />\nThe toss-up gave us the south goal, and<br />\nquickly the two teams lined up. After a<br />\nfew anxious moments of suspense, Referee<br />\nKistler sounded the whistle, and the battle<br />\nbegan which was to decide our chances at<br />\nthe new game. The first encouragement<br />\nwas remarked in the fact that our centre,<br />\nHelmholtz, had been well placed, for with<br />\nremarkable precision he sent the ball to<br />\nHolmes. After the first few moments, required for the individual opponents to size<br />\nup each other, it gradually became apparent<br />\nthat our better team work was going to give<br />\nus unexpected chances. The game put up<br />\nby the Maryland boys, while not lacking in.<br />\nardor, was disappointing from the frequency<br />\nwith which their players fouled.<br />\nThese<br />\nfouls were made more conspicuous by the<br />\naccuracy with which we took advantage of<br />\nthem in getting goals from the foul line.<br />\nWithin the first five minutes Holmes had<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nthrice filled the basket on foul goals. Then<br />\nfor a short while Maryland turned the tables<br />\non us and secured two foul goals. It would<br />\nbe impossible to decribe in detail the plays<br />\nthat followed. Suffice it to say that we<br />\nshowed throughout the game superior team<br />\nwork and goal throwing. McClure threw<br />\ntwo field goals in the first half and Holmes<br />\nadded another to the score, together with<br />\nthree more foul goals.<br />\nThe second half showed for a while a<br />\nchange for the better in Maryland's playing,<br />\nbut the change was short-lived. Five more<br />\nfoul goals and one field goal were scored by<br />\nHolmes, while Helmholtz threw the fifth one.<br />\nMaryland succeeded in placing two field<br />\ngoals and two more foul goals to her credit,<br />\nand the game ended with the score 20-8.<br />\nThe feature of the game was the extreme<br />\naccuracy displayed by Captain Holmes in<br />\nthrowing goal from the foul line. Out of<br />\nthe fifteen chances offered him he succeeded<br />\nin ten. Maryland threw four foul goals out<br />\nof the fourteen chances offered. The strong<br />\ndefense work of Strobar and McClure also<br />\ndeserves special mention.<br />\nOur line-up was as follows: Helmholtz,<br />\nc; Holmes (Capt.), r. f.; Holden\u2014Blanck,<br />\nI. f.; McClure, r. d.; Strobar, 1. d.<br /><br />\nPENN., 42; HOPKINS, 13.<br />\nBefore a large and enthusiastic audience<br />\nHopkins went down to defeat last Friday<br />\nnight in what was undoubtedly the most important game of basket ball which the University has played this season. I say enthusiastic; yes, for the friends of both teams,<br />\nHopkins and Penn, were out in full force,<br />\nand yelled lustily for their respective favorites. But some of the friends of the Black<br />\nand Blue were not so enthusiastic, for to play<br />\nand defeat Dickinson is one thing; and to<br />\ntackle old Penn is another, for it must be<br />\nremembered that Penn's basket ball team is<br />\nscarcely excelled by any in the country, unless it be Columbia's.<br />\nIt is not to be expected that such a new<br />\naggregation of players as Hopkins has can<br />\nsuccessfully cope with such old veterans as<br />\nPenn; and although Hopkins lost the game,<br />\nit is to our great credit that we scored<br />\nat all.<br />\nShortly after the game started it became<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\napparent that Hopkins was utterly outclassed. Our team work could not possibly<br />\nequal that of our opponents, which was almost perfect, for no matter where the ball<br />\nwas sent, it nearly always landed in Penn's<br />\nhands. Penn's long passes were the features<br />\nof the game; and their team work and speed<br />\nwill long be remembered. Most of Hopkins'<br />\ngoals were made from the foul, and while<br />\nthe visitors made their 42 goals almost at<br />\nwill, the locals found opportunity to pile up<br />\n13 for themselves.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nJ. H. U.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nU. of P.<br /><br />\nMcClure<br />\nR F.<br />\nFlint<br />\nBoyd<br />\nL F<br />\nniers<br />\nHolmes<br />\nWalker<br />\nHoughton<br />\nR D.<br />\nFales<br />\nStrobar<br />\n.L.

Score<br />\n\u2014U. of P., 42; J. H. U., 13.<br /><br />\nTHE MEET.<br />\nThe ninth annual indoor meet of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University was, in every respect, a<br />\ndecided success. There was a large and enthusiastic attendance; the events were well<br />\ncontested; and, what is more important to<br />\nthe Hopkins student, the University won the<br />\nmeet by a good margin. The failure to obtain a worthy opponent for the relay team<br />\nwas the cause of much disappointment; but<br />\nthe disappointment was somewhat lessened<br />\nby the excellent work of the Hopkins men<br />\nin the individual events. Entered in seven<br />\nevents, they won three firsts, five seconds and<br />\none third, making a total of 31 points out of<br />\na possible 63.<br />\nThe events were run off with a promptness which reflects great credit upon the<br />\nofficials. Hill won the open thirty yard dash<br />\nby a very small margin from Walker of<br />\nGeorgetown. In the quarter, Gilbert ran<br />\nsecond to Randall, M. A. C., who, as usual,<br />\nwon; and Hunter was beaten out by Lorando, G. U., by a yard for third place.<br />\nStewart put up a splendid fight for first in<br />\nthe half, but was beaten out by Lorando in<br />\nthe same time in which the latter won the<br />\nevent last year. Boyce, J. H. U., was third.<br />\nHopkins did not place in the high jump;<br />\nbut took both first and second in the shot put.<br />\nThe prettiest race of the evening was,<br /><br />\nwithout doubt, the mile. Breyer, B. C. C.,<br />\nset a fast pace from the start. At the fifteenth, lap Morse passed him with some difficulty and held the lead until the last lap<br />\nwhen Griffith, who had been quietly holding<br />\nthird, made a beautiful sprint and won by<br />\nabout 10 yards.<br />\nThe surprise of the evening came in the<br />\nbroad jump. Davis, of the City College, beat<br />\nHill by about nine inches. Hill's best jump<br />\nwas 21 ft. 8 in., while Davis jumped 22 ft.<br />\n51/2 in. Hill's jump was far below his usual<br />\nmark; his failure was probably due to overconfidence, as he missed the take-off several<br />\ntimes.<br />\nThe inter-scholastic events and the relay<br />\nraces were close and interesting, and good<br />\nmarks were made in all, especially the 30yard dash, in which the time was one-fifth<br />\nof a second faster than that of the open dash.<br />\nThe only fault to be found with the meet<br />\nis one which the officials were, perhaps, unable to prevent: the crowding of the spectators on the field. The only persons who had<br />\na right on the field were the athletes, the<br />\nofficials, and the spectators who held seats<br />\non the grounds; nevertheless there were<br />\nabout three times as many people crowded<br />\non the field. The contestants in both the<br />\nbroad jump and pole vault were hindered<br />\nby the crowds, and at the next meet some<br />\nremedy should be found for this evil.<br />\nThe following is a summary of events of<br />\nspecial interest to Hopkins men:<br />\n30-yard Dash (open).

It is astonishing upon<br />\nreading the book to find how much of one's<br />\nconception of the great Corsican belongs to<br />\nthe realm of pure fancy. The story does not<br />\npretend to be exhaustive, but the light it<br />\nsheds upon the character and motives of<br />\nthe real Napoleon make it valuable, while<br />\nthe easy style of the writer renders it delightful reading.<br />\nNot the least interesting part of the volume is a reprint of the famous satire of Jean<br />\nBaptiste Peres, published in 1827.<br />\nThis<br />\nsatire, one of the best ever written in any<br />\nlanguage, was intended as an attack upon<br />\nthe scepticism of the age in which it was<br />\npublished, and was directed more especially<br />\nat the teachings of M. Depuis, who main-<br /><br />\ntained that all religions, that of Jesus of<br />\nNazareth among them, could be explained as<br />\nsolar myths. Using the exact methods of M.<br />\nDupuis, Peres \"proved\" with a delightful<br />\nmimicry of historical methods, that Napoleon<br />\nwas merely an allegorical being, the personification of the sun!<br />\nThe book is handsomely bound and is illustrated with excellent reproductions of<br />\nfamous Napoleonic pictures.<br />\n\"Tor A Street Boy of Jerusalem,\" by<br />\nFlorence Morse Kingsley; 7x41/; 190 pp.;<br />\nprice $1.00; Henry Altemus Co., 507-513<br />\nCherry Street, Philadelphia, Pa.<br />\n\"Tor\" is a first-rate story and at the same<br />\ntime a book of some historical value.
