Yet the percentage of<br />\nthose high school graduates who<br />\nhave gone on to college has<br />\ndropped steadily from an all-time<br />\nhigh of 55% in 1968 to 47% in<br />\n1974.

H. Bell.<br />\n\u2014 Enrollments vary drastically<br />\nacross the country. Citing lack of<br />\nspace, the University of Colorado<br />\nturned away 200 upperclassmen<br />\nwho showed up to register this<br />\nfall. The students failed to notify<br />\nthe university by August that<br />\n<br />\nCollege for some a dead-end<br />\n(CPS)\u2014There was a time when<br />\ngoing to college was an honor, a<br />\npromsiing sign, a good omen for<br />\nthe future. Jobs were plentiful'<br />\nfor the upwardly mobile.<br />\nCollege-educated people were<br />\nthought to be bound for a better<br />\nworld, armed with the ability to<br />\nthink and analyze that they had<br />\nacquired in college. If everyone<br />\nwere college educated, many<br />\npeople thought, the world would<br />\nbe a better place to live.<br />\nBut Caroline Bird, author of<br />\nthe controversial book The Case<br />\nAgainst College, and a college<br />\ngraduate herself, argues that<br />\nthese were just society's myths<br />\nduring the education boom of<br />\nthe late fifties and sixties. The<br />\nspace race with Russia was in<br />\nprogress and mass higher<br />\neducation seemed to be the hope<br />\nof the future. But statistics in the<br />\nearly seventies show that many<br />\ncollege graduates are working in<br />\nfactories, driving cabs or waiting<br />\non tables. It has also become<br />\napparent to some that college<br />\ngraduates are not the invaluable<br />\ncommodity they once were<br />\nthought to be.<br />\nWhy then, Bird wonders<br />\nrhetorically, are so many young<br />\npeople still flocking to college,<br />\nknowing that four years of<br />\ntrainign won't insure them a job<br />\nin their fields? It is partly the<br />\nreligion of the liberal arts<br />\neducation, Bird concludes. A<br />\nbody of worship has come to<br />\nsurround the liberally educated<br />\nPerson. No one dares to propose<br />\nthat better and more useful<br />\nlearning can be obtained outside<br />\nthe university walls. The ideal<br />\nRenaissance -style liberal<br />\neducation is an unquestioned<br />\ngood.<br />\n<br />\nIi<br />\n<br />\nBut Bird suggests that learning<br />\noutside the university would be a<br />\nbetter choice for as many as a<br />\nthird of the students now in<br />\ncollege who came to get away<br />\nfrom home, to be independent<br />\nwithout really cutting off all ties<br />\nor just to pass four years without<br />\nhaving to take an unpromising<br />\njob.<br />\nBird's evaluation of the college<br />\nexperience has been the subject<br />\nof heated criticism by college<br />\nadministrators and students.<br />\nAttacks by administrators have<br />\nusually centered on her section<br />\nconcerning college as an<br />\ninvestment. Bird contends that if<br />\na student took the money he<br />\nspent on college-related expenses,<br />\nadded the money he wouldhave<br />\nearned working those four years,<br />\nand put it all into a bank instead,<br />\nby age 60 he would have<br />\naccumulated more money than a<br />\ncollege graduate who earned the<br />\naverage yearly salary for<br />\ncollege-educated workers. In<br />\nother words, don't do it for the<br />\nmoney, Bird advises.<br />\nOddly enough, an American<br />\nCouncil of Education survey<br />\nshowed that more students were<br />\ngoing to college to be \"very well<br />\noff\" in 1974 than in 1966, when<br />\nthe chances of attaining that goal<br />\nsoon after college were much<br />\ngreater.<br />\nAttacks by recent graduates<br />\nhave been harsher and more<br />\nangry than those by<br />\nadministrators and professors,<br />\nBird said in an interview. \"I've<br />\nreceived many illiterate attacks<br />\nfrom people who have just<br />\ngraduated from college, which<br />\nproves my point.\"<br />\n\"College graduates tend to feel<br />\nthat by my saying college is not<br />\n<br />\nall that good, I'm taking<br />\nsomething away from them.<br />\nThey think if I'd only shut up,<br />\nthings about college would be a<br />\nlot better,\" Bird said.<br />\nBird's critics have also claimed<br />\nthat college enriches the society<br />\nby producing better citizens, but<br />\nBird finds this myth as invalid as<br />\nthe rest. College doesn't create<br />\nbright, ambitious, happy, liberal<br />\npeople from nothing. The bright,<br />\nambitious, happy, liberal people<br />\nare the ones who choose to go to<br />\ncollege. This class selectivity may<br />\nbecome more prevalent as tuition<br />\nand expenses rise while loan<br />\nmoney becomes scarcer and more<br />\nexpensive.<br />\nSnobbishness<br />\nFor now, society uses the<br />\ncollege degree as a kind of<br />\nfirst-round screening in picking<br />\ncandidates for the future. In<br />\nmany cases, Bird argues, a college<br />\neducation is unnecessary since<br />\nmost jobs require extensive<br />\ntraining that a \u2022 person with<br />\ncommon sense could easily pick<br />\nup. It is a kind of snobbishness<br />\nwhich is based more on pretense<br />\nthan reality.<br />\n\"The bellhop at the hotel<br />\nwhere I stayed last night had a<br />\ncollege degree,\" Bird said. \"If a<br />\nhotel can afford to require their<br />\nbellhops to have a college degree,<br />\nthey will. If everybody goes to<br />\ncollege, you can demand a degree<br />\nto be a bellhop. It's just like<br />\ncharging everybody a heavy tax<br />\nfor getting a job\u2014any job.<br />\n. Bird said she hadn't changed<br />\nher assessment of college because<br />\nof the reactions she has received.<br />\n\"College is fine if you want it,<br />\nbut it can't be thrust upon you.<br />\nNobody will stop dead if they<br />\ndon't go to college.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Pulp Soap Opera:<br />\nComic Books<br />\nStan Lee<br />\nEditor and publisher<br />\nMarvel Comics Groups<br />\nOctober 13, 4:00 P.M.<br />\nShriver Hall<br />\nReception Afterwards<br />\nIn The<br />\nClipper Room<br />\n<br />\nTHEPEN AS THESWORD<br />\n<br />\nthey were returning, university<br />\nofficials explained.

According to a<br />\nsoon-to-be-released Office of<br />\nEducation study, tuition is rising<br />\nfaster than the consumer price<br />\nindex.

The<br />\nOffice of Education predicts that<br />\nenrollment will gradually level<br />\noff until the 1980's when it will<br />\nbegin to drop.

While we<br />\ncan understand the community's natural response to having<br />\nhousing units removed from the market, we feel they have<br />\noverreacted to what seems to us to be a reasonable<br />\ncompromise between the University's need for more housing<br />\nand the Community's desire to preserve its neighborhoods<br />\nOf all the buildings in the area the Baltimorean seems to<br />\ndeprive the community of the least housing, since many of<br />\nthe residents are on short-term leases.<br />\nIn addition, Hopkins, if anything, is likely to refurbish the<br />\nbuilding. The very presence of the University on 29th Street<br />\nwill probably increase the security provided in that<br />\nneighborhood, and consequently make it a safer place for all<br />\nresidents to live.<br />\nMoreover, we believe that the way the University has gone<br />\nabout the proposed purchase of the Baltimorean has been in<br />\nthe spirit of community cooperation. Hopkins has not yet<br />\nbought the building and has consulted the community<br />\nbeforehand, as it said it would. Even the students are aware<br />\nof the need for increased communication and understanding<br />\nbetween the University and the Community, as evidenced by<br />\nthe formation of the Student Council's Community Relations<br />\nCommittee. We never expect area residents to be overjoyed<br />\nwith a Hopkins purchase of a large bloc of housing, but they<br />\nshould realize that the University\u2014its students\u2014have certain<br />\nneeds which must be met in a reasonable manner. While we<br />\nrealize that the Community may have been abused by<br />\nHopkins in the past, we hope they will act in the spirit of<br />\ncooperation and consider the needs of others as we trust the<br />\nUniversity will.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nRecently, a serious problem<br />\nhas come to my attention. Within<br />\nthe past two weeks, five<br />\nundergraduates have been<br />\nsubjected to some form of<br />\nassault. The specific incidents<br />\nwere as follows:<br />\n1. On September 25, 11:30<br />\np.m., two students were robbed<br />\nat gunpoint while walking north!<br />\n-3n Charles Street.<br />\n2. The week of September 22,<br />\n(the victim could not be reached<br />\nto get the exact date) a student<br />\nwas assaulted and knifed on West<br />\nUniversity Parkway while<br />\nwalking to his car.<br />\n3. On October 2 at 2:30 a.m.,<br />\na student was assaulted and<br />\nrequired hospital attention. The<br />\nassault took place at North<br />\nCalvert and 30th Street as the<br />\nstudent was returning home.<br />\n4. On October 5, at 9:00 p.m.,<br />\na Baltimore youth broke into the<br />\nhome of four Hopkins students,<br />\nnear 30th Street and Guilford. A<br />\nself-confessed \"junkie,\" he was<br />\nlooking for money to support his<br />\nhabit. Only one member of the<br />\nhousehold was at home, and she<br />\n<br />\nwas confronted by the youth<br />\nwhile in the bathroom.<br />\nAll four of these incidents<br />\ninvolving students occurred<br />\neither in the student ghetto or in<br />\nthe immediate area of campus.<br />\nBut only one of these incidents<br />\never appeared in the News-Letter.<br />\nI realize that there is no sure<br />\nsolution to the crime problem.<br />\nHowever, I hope that by using<br />\nthe News-Letter to increase<br />\nstudent awareness, we could<br />\nreduce the crimes against<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe purpose of this letter is<br />\nnot to attack the News-Letter,<br />\nbut to expose a problem which<br />\nmost of the campus seems to<br />\nignore.<br />\nAll four incidents were<br />\nreported to the Baltimore Police.<br />\nbut Campus Security was only<br />\naware of one.<br />\nThe recent outbreak of crimes<br />\nagainst students should not be<br />\ntreated lightly. It is a serious<br />\nproblem that deserves immediate<br />\nattention from students,<br />\nUniversity officials, and police.<br />\nSheldon Himelfarb<br />\nJunior Class President<br />\n<br />\nThe Gonzo Hero's fans<br />\nget what they came for<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nThe time was right for an<br />\nhonest to god spectacle at<br />\nHomewood. See, it had come to<br />\nthe point where excitement<br />\nseekers were roaming around<br />\ncampus with hands in pockets<br />\nand question mark faces, uttering<br />\nonly an occasional \"Hey man,<br />\nwhat's goin' on, any kicks to be<br />\nhad around here?\" It's true, the<br />\nnovelty of the new school year<br />\nhas evaporated, students are<br />\nstarting to take classes and<br />\nstudies seriously, gossip of<br />\nphysics tests and organic labs are<br />\nfilling the lunchroom. Yup, the<br />\nhoneymoon is over.<br />\nWhen Carl Bernstein opened<br />\nthe MSE Symposium last<br />\nMonday, some of us had hope<br />\nthat the doldrums would be<br />\ndramatically interrupted. No<br />\nluck. Bernstein said nothing new,<br />\nall the funnies in his speech were<br />\nculled from his best seller, All the<br />\nPresident's Men. But wait, the<br />\noptimists cried out, Dr. Hunter S.<br />\nThompson, the one and only<br />\nRaoul Duke, would be speaking<br />\nThursday in Shriver Hall. What a<br />\ntrip it would be. Bets were waged<br />\nas to whether he'd light up a<br />\nstick of dynamite Pago Pago<br />\nweed on stage, and if not that,<br />\nthe podium would definitely be<br />\nflooded with Coors cans. \"For<br />\nsure!\" squealed the Thompson<br />\nfreak.<br />\nAnd so, yesterday, Shriver Hall<br />\nwas filled to capacity, housed<br />\nwith the usual Symposium<br />\nattendees, but mostly with the<br />\ntroops of Thompson's local<br />\nlegions, all arriving with<br />\npre-conceived notions of the<br />\nmass-appointed Gonzo Hero.<br />\nThey were hardly disappointed<br />\nwith the Symposium Wheels very<br />\nnoticeably furnished the stage<br />\nwith a block of ice, numerous<br />\nglasses and a bottle of Wild<br />\nTurkey. Cheers thundered from<br />\nthe crowd, and when he walked<br />\non stage, well, you might have<br />\nthought Christ or even Charlie<br />\nChaplin was making a rare guest<br />\nappearance. Scores of<br />\n<br />\nconversations could be heard<br />\nfrom either side of the<br />\nauditorium, and you know what,<br />\nthey were all the same! Listen to<br />\nthis: \"Man, I told you so. Look<br />\nat that whiskey, I knew he got<br />\nfucked up all the time, he's so<br />\ncool, leave it to old Hunter S.<br />\nYou know, I picked up on him a<br />\nlong time ago, back when he<br />\nwrote Fear and Loathing in Las<br />\nVegas. Man, I bet he's stoned as<br />\nshit.\"<br />\nIt was the most informal of<br />\nSymposium settings. The<br />\naudience was wholly uninhibited,<br />\nshouting yay or nay to the<br />\ncomments, openly hissing when<br />\nthe Symposium Wheels asked<br />\ntrite questions. No smoking signs<br />\nwere blatantly ignored and fans<br />\nsat wherever they wanted, in the<br />\nseats, aisles, anywhere. A rowdier<br />\ncrowd the Symposium had not<br />\nseen.<br />\nThe canned format for the<br />\nperformance was poorly planned.<br />\nThe Wheels were intent on<br />\nkeeping Thompson away from<br />\ndrug or gonzo talk, the subjects<br />\nthat everyone came to hear.<br />\nWhen Thompson began to<br />\nramble, his manager,<br />\nconveniently seated in the center<br />\nfirst row, was quick to ask<br />\npolitical questions and put the<br />\nshow back on target. But the<br />\ncharade had to stop. After the<br />\nWheels repeatedly asked<br />\nquestions like \"Do you have faith<br />\nin the American people?\" it was<br />\nclear that things were not going<br />\nquite right. Finally, Thompson<br />\nhad to suggest that the audience<br />\nbe permitted to join in with the<br />\nquestions. People didn't come to<br />\nsee Thompson the alleged<br />\njournalist, they wanted<br />\nThompson the cult figure, Duke<br />\nof Doonesbury fame. One even<br />\nexpected Zonker to make a quick<br />\nside entrance, ready to fill his<br />\n\"uncle's\" whiskey glass.<br />\nEven though the Wheels<br />\nstruggled to confine Thompson's<br />\nremarks to politics and<br />\njournalism, Duke was able to<br />\ndigress often enough to evoke<br />\n<br />\ninstant guffaws and howls from<br />\nhis many admirers. He would<br />\nmumble something totally<br />\npredictable like,\"Ah, Humphrey,<br />\nthat no good swine,\" and zoom,<br />\nhalf the audience was yukking it<br />\nup.<br />\nBut the real hero worshipping<br />\nwas reserved for the reception in<br />\nthe Clipper Room. Thompson<br />\nand his entourage climbed ever so<br />\ngingerly up the stairs, into the<br />\nswarm of fans. Immediately, he<br />\nwas beseiged with dope-growing<br />\nhints, lit hash pipes and the finest<br />\nacid this side of Charles St.<br />\nHunter whispered to his aides in<br />\nrambling slurred speech, \"Hey<br />\nget me to the window, too<br />\ncrowded here, get me some air.\"<br />\nAnd sure enough, his loyal<br />\nkeepers took him to the window,<br />\nassuring him that he wasn't too<br />\nburned out to face the crowd.<br />\nBut those looking for a crazed<br />\nThompson found exactly that.<br />\nHands trembling as he<br />\nchain-smoked Dunhills, his eyes<br />\nshifted nervously around the<br />\nroom as he asked his aides<br />\nquestions like \"Can I turn around<br />\nnow, nothing behind me, are you<br />\nsure it's all right;\" and quickly,<br />\nhis keepers responded \"yeah, it's<br />\nall right Hunter, don't worry.\"<br />\nPut-on<br />\nHe might have been putting us<br />\non. It seemed a wee bit<br />\norchestrated, like he pulled the<br />\nsame tricks at each college<br />\naudience, satisfying his fans with<br />\na stoned front. They hung on his<br />\nevery word and nodded with<br />\ndeep understanding when his<br />\nsecretary threw out tired lines<br />\nlike, \"Well, Hunter isn't like any<br />\nother writer. No, he can't be<br />\nforced to write, he just does it,<br />\nand when it happens it's always<br />\ngreat, there's no one like him.\"<br />\nOf course, it doesn't really<br />\nmatter if Thompson's act was<br />\nstaged or real. People wanted to<br />\nsee the legendary drug-crazed<br />\nwriter, someone they understood<br />\nand could identify with.

If you<br />\ninclude sports, Hopkins has the<br />\nbest lacrosse program and team<br />\nfrom coast to coast.<br />\nBut one area where the<br />\nUniversity could use some<br />\ndefinite modernization and<br />\nimprovement is the Homewood<br />\nplaying fields.

If everyone<br />\nwere college educated, many<br />\npeople thought, the world would<br />\nbe a better place to live.<br />\nBut Caroline Bird, author of<br />\nthe controversial book The Case<br />\nAgainst College, and a college<br />\ngraduate herself, argues that<br />\nthese were just society's myths<br />\nduring the education boom of<br />\nthe late fifties and sixties. The<br />\nspace race with Russia was in<br />\nprogress and mass higher<br />\neducation seemed to be the hope<br />\nof the future. But statistics in the<br />\nearly seventies show that many<br />\ncollege graduates are working in<br />\nfactories, driving cabs or waiting<br />\non tables. It has also become<br />\napparent to some that college<br />\ngraduates are not the invaluable<br />\ncommodity they once were<br />\nthought to be.<br />\nWhy then, Bird wonders<br />\nrhetorically, are so many young<br />\npeople still flocking to college,<br />\nknowing that four years of<br />\ntrainign won't insure them a job<br />\nin their fields? It is partly the<br />\nreligion of the liberal arts<br />\neducation, Bird concludes. A<br />\nbody of worship has come to<br />\nsurround the liberally educated<br />\nPerson. No one dares to propose<br />\nthat better and more useful<br />\nlearning can be obtained outside<br />\nthe university walls. The ideal<br />\nRenaissance -style liberal<br />\neducation is an unquestioned<br />\ngood.<br /><br />\nIi<br /><br />\nBut Bird suggests that learning<br />\noutside the university would be a<br />\nbetter choice for as many as a<br />\nthird of the students now in<br />\ncollege who came to get away<br />\nfrom home, to be independent<br />\nwithout really cutting off all ties<br />\nor just to pass four years without<br />\nhaving to take an unpromising<br />\njob.<br />\nBird's evaluation of the college<br />\nexperience has been the subject<br />\nof heated criticism by college<br />\nadministrators and students.<br />\nAttacks by administrators have<br />\nusually centered on her section<br />\nconcerning college as an<br />\ninvestment. Bird contends that if<br />\na student took the money he<br />\nspent on college-related expenses,<br />\nadded the money he wouldhave<br />\nearned working those four years,<br />\nand put it all into a bank instead,<br />\nby age 60 he would have<br />\naccumulated more money than a<br />\ncollege graduate who earned the<br />\naverage yearly salary for<br />\ncollege-educated workers. In<br />\nother words, don't do it for the<br />\nmoney, Bird advises.<br />\nOddly enough, an American<br />\nCouncil of Education survey<br />\nshowed that more students were<br />\ngoing to college to be \"very well<br />\noff\" in 1974 than in 1966, when<br />\nthe chances of attaining that goal<br />\nsoon after college were much<br />\ngreater.<br />\nAttacks by recent graduates<br />\nhave been harsher and more<br />\nangry than those by<br />\nadministrators and professors,<br />\nBird said in an interview. \"I've<br />\nreceived many illiterate attacks<br />\nfrom people who have just<br />\ngraduated from college, which<br />\nproves my point.\"<br />\n\"College graduates tend to feel<br />\nthat by my saying college is not<br /><br />\nall that good, I'm taking<br />\nsomething away from them.<br />\nThey think if I'd only shut up,<br />\nthings about college would be a<br />\nlot better,\" Bird said.<br />\nBird's critics have also claimed<br />\nthat college enriches the society<br />\nby producing better citizens, but<br />\nBird finds this myth as invalid as<br />\nthe rest. College doesn't create<br />\nbright, ambitious, happy, liberal<br />\npeople from nothing. The bright,<br />\nambitious, happy, liberal people<br />\nare the ones who choose to go to<br />\ncollege. This class selectivity may<br />\nbecome more prevalent as tuition<br />\nand expenses rise while loan<br />\nmoney becomes scarcer and more<br />\nexpensive.<br />\nSnobbishness<br />\nFor now, society uses the<br />\ncollege degree as a kind of<br />\nfirst-round screening in picking<br />\ncandidates for the future. In<br />\nmany cases, Bird argues, a college<br />\neducation is unnecessary since<br />\nmost jobs require extensive<br />\ntraining that a \u2022 person with<br />\ncommon sense could easily pick<br />\nup. It is a kind of snobbishness<br />\nwhich is based more on pretense<br />\nthan reality.<br />\n\"The bellhop at the hotel<br />\nwhere I stayed last night had a<br />\ncollege degree,\" Bird said. \"If a<br />\nhotel can afford to require their<br />\nbellhops to have a college degree,<br />\nthey will. If everybody goes to<br />\ncollege, you can demand a degree<br />\nto be a bellhop. It's just like<br />\ncharging everybody a heavy tax<br />\nfor getting a job\u2014any job.<br />\n. Bird said she hadn't changed<br />\nher assessment of college because<br />\nof the reactions she has received.<br />\n\"College is fine if you want it,<br />\nbut it can't be thrust upon you.<br />\nNobody will stop dead if they<br />\ndon't go to college.\"<br /><br />\nThe Pulp Soap Opera:<br />\nComic Books<br />\nStan Lee<br />\nEditor and publisher<br />\nMarvel Comics Groups<br />\nOctober 13, 4:00 P.M.<br />\nShriver Hall<br />\nReception Afterwards<br />\nIn The<br />\nClipper Room<br /><br />\nTHEPEN AS THESWORD<br /><br />\nthey were returning, university<br />\nofficials explained. At Case<br />\nWestern Reserve University in<br />\nCleveland, Ohio, however,<br />\nundergraduate enrollment is<br />\ndown 5% this year.<br />\n\u2014More students are going to<br />\ntwo-year colleges. Enrollment in<br />\npublic two-year colleges is<br />\nexpected to hit 2.3 million<br />\nstudents, an increase of 6.7%<br />\nover last year, according to the<br />\nOffice of Education.<br />\n\u2014Fewer students from<br />\nmiddle-income families are<br />\nenrolling in college. New data<br />\nfrom the Bureau of Statistics<br />\nshows that among families in the<br />\n$10,000 to $15,000-a -year<br />\nincome bracket, college<br />\nattendence fell 9% from 1969 to<br />\n1973. The decline is considerably<br />\nless for families with incomes<br />\nbelow $7500 and for those above<br />\n$15,000.<br />\nExperts disagree on why fewer<br />\nhigh school students are enrolling<br />\nin college.<br />\nAccording to Stampen of<br />\nAASCU, \"increased college costs<br />\nexplain declining attendance<br />\nrates.\" But a frequently given<br />\nreason for declining college<br />\nattendence, the end of the draft,<br />\nwas not a major factor, according<br />\nto Stampen. \"Attendance began<br />\ndeclining in 1968, long before<br />\nthe end of the Vietnam War and<br />\nthe draft,\" he says.<br />\nWhether the major factor for<br />\ndeclining attendance or not,college costs have jumped<br />\ndrastically. According to a<br />\nsoon-to-be-released Office of<br />\nEducation study, tuition is rising<br />\nfaster than the consumer price<br />\nindex. While the consumer price<br />\nindex has risen 57% from 1967<br />\nto 1975, tuition at public schools<br />\nhas increased 69% during the<br />\nsame period and tuition at<br />\nprivate schools has jumped 76%,<br /><br />\nsays Kent Halstead, an Office of<br />\nEducation official.<br />\nYet rising tuition may not play<br />\nas large a part in enrollment rates<br />\nas students' apprehensions about<br />\nthe decreasing economic value of<br />\na college degree, according to J.P.<br />\nLipsack, director of Purdue<br />\nUniversity's Office of Manpower<br />\nStudies.<br />\nLipsack recently completed a<br />\nsurvey of Indiana high school<br />\nstudents and found that a smaller<br />\nproportion of them planned to<br />\nattend college. \"There was a<br />\nfeeling that the job market for<br />\ncollege graduates is saturated,\"<br />\nLipsack says. \"The students<br />\nthink, 'God, you get a degree and<br />\nyou still can't get a job!\"<br />\nThe enrollment forecast calls<br />\nfor more gathering clouds. The<br />\nOffice of Education predicts that<br />\nenrollment will gradually level<br />\noff until the 1980's when it will<br />\nbegin to drop. How big a drop is<br />\na matter of dispute, but at least<br />\none indicator of bad times to<br />\ncome is that. elementary school<br />\nenrollment was down by more<br />\nthan 600,000 this year.<br />\nAt least one school doesn't<br />\nseem fazed by the dwindling<br />\nenrollments, however. At a time<br />\nwhen most colleges are relaxing<br />\ntheir admissions standards,<br />\nAlfred University in New York<br />\nhas announced that standards<br />\nwill be tightened this year. \"Only<br />\nschools which are strong<br />\nacademically will be able to<br />\n.survive when the full force of the<br />\ndeclining college-age population<br />\nhits the country,\" the admissions<br />\ndirector says.<br />\nBut in at least one area,<br />\nAlfred's strength has been<br />\nsignificantly reduced this fall:<br />\nhigher standards have cost the<br />\nschool 60 fewer freshmen and an<br />\nestimated $200.000 in tuition<br />\nand room and board revenues.<br /><br />\nBUSES<br />\nto<br />\nWASHINGTON D.C.<br />\nSATURDAY OCT. 18<br />\nTwo stops in WashingtonGEORGETOWN<br />\nand the<br />\nSMITHSONIAN<br />\nLeave the Union:<br />\nReturn:<br /><br />\n10:30<br />\n4:30<br /><br />\nTOTAL COST: $1.00<br />\nSign up at the Desk or<br />\nWednesday dinner in the dorms<br />\nSponsored by the SCSC I<br /><br />\noctoher 10. 1975/news-letter/page 5<br />\n...-:::::: \u2022-::::.<br />\n:::::\u2022::::.;-::::....:::::<br />\n.\u2022:<br />\n;<br />\n\u2022:<br />\n\u2022:.::<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n.<br />\n.;\u2022::::.;-::::.:-::::.,\u2022\u2022::::;.%::::.,\u2022\u2022::::..\u2022\u2022:<br />\n:<br />\n.\u2022\u2022::::.,\u2022\u2022::::.,\u2022\u2022:<br />\n.<br />\n.%:<br />\n:::.,\u2022\u2022::::<br />\n::\u2022,....::<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n.,%::::....:::-...\u2022\u2022:<br />\n:<br />\n.,\u2022\u2022:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n::.:-:::<br />\n.:<br />\n-0:<br />\ni::::::::::::<br /><br />\n1.

While we<br />\ncan understand the community's natural response to having<br />\nhousing units removed from the market, we feel they have<br />\noverreacted to what seems to us to be a reasonable<br />\ncompromise between the University's need for more housing<br />\nand the Community's desire to preserve its neighborhoods<br />\nOf all the buildings in the area the Baltimorean seems to<br />\ndeprive the community of the least housing, since many of<br />\nthe residents are on short-term leases.<br />\nIn addition, Hopkins, if anything, is likely to refurbish the<br />\nbuilding. The very presence of the University on 29th Street<br />\nwill probably increase the security provided in that<br />\nneighborhood, and consequently make it a safer place for all<br />\nresidents to live.<br />\nMoreover, we believe that the way the University has gone<br />\nabout the proposed purchase of the Baltimorean has been in<br />\nthe spirit of community cooperation. Hopkins has not yet<br />\nbought the building and has consulted the community<br />\nbeforehand, as it said it would. Even the students are aware<br />\nof the need for increased communication and understanding<br />\nbetween the University and the Community, as evidenced by<br />\nthe formation of the Student Council's Community Relations<br />\nCommittee. We never expect area residents to be overjoyed<br />\nwith a Hopkins purchase of a large bloc of housing, but they<br />\nshould realize that the University\u2014its students\u2014have certain<br />\nneeds which must be met in a reasonable manner. While we<br />\nrealize that the Community may have been abused by<br />\nHopkins in the past, we hope they will act in the spirit of<br />\ncooperation and consider the needs of others as we trust the<br />\nUniversity will.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nRecently, a serious problem<br />\nhas come to my attention.

Bets were waged<br />\nas to whether he'd light up a<br />\nstick of dynamite Pago Pago<br />\nweed on stage, and if not that,<br />\nthe podium would definitely be<br />\nflooded with Coors cans. \"For<br />\nsure!\" squealed the Thompson<br />\nfreak.<br />\nAnd so, yesterday, Shriver Hall<br />\nwas filled to capacity, housed<br />\nwith the usual Symposium<br />\nattendees, but mostly with the<br />\ntroops of Thompson's local<br />\nlegions, all arriving with<br />\npre-conceived notions of the<br />\nmass-appointed Gonzo Hero.<br />\nThey were hardly disappointed<br />\nwith the Symposium Wheels very<br />\nnoticeably furnished the stage<br />\nwith a block of ice, numerous<br />\nglasses and a bottle of Wild<br />\nTurkey. Cheers thundered from<br />\nthe crowd, and when he walked<br />\non stage, well, you might have<br />\nthought Christ or even Charlie<br />\nChaplin was making a rare guest<br />\nappearance. Scores of<br /><br />\nconversations could be heard<br />\nfrom either side of the<br />\nauditorium, and you know what,<br />\nthey were all the same! Listen to<br />\nthis: \"Man, I told you so. Look<br />\nat that whiskey, I knew he got<br />\nfucked up all the time, he's so<br />\ncool, leave it to old Hunter S.<br />\nYou know, I picked up on him a<br />\nlong time ago, back when he<br />\nwrote Fear and Loathing in Las<br />\nVegas. Man, I bet he's stoned as<br />\nshit.\"<br />\nIt was the most informal of<br />\nSymposium settings. The<br />\naudience was wholly uninhibited,<br />\nshouting yay or nay to the<br />\ncomments, openly hissing when<br />\nthe Symposium Wheels asked<br />\ntrite questions. No smoking signs<br />\nwere blatantly ignored and fans<br />\nsat wherever they wanted, in the<br />\nseats, aisles, anywhere. A rowdier<br />\ncrowd the Symposium had not<br />\nseen.<br />\nThe canned format for the<br />\nperformance was poorly planned.<br />\nThe Wheels were intent on<br />\nkeeping Thompson away from<br />\ndrug or gonzo talk, the subjects<br />\nthat everyone came to hear.<br />\nWhen Thompson began to<br />\nramble, his manager,<br />\nconveniently seated in the center<br />\nfirst row, was quick to ask<br />\npolitical questions and put the<br />\nshow back on target. But the<br />\ncharade had to stop. After the<br />\nWheels repeatedly asked<br />\nquestions like \"Do you have faith<br />\nin the American people?\" it was<br />\nclear that things were not going<br />\nquite right. Finally, Thompson<br />\nhad to suggest that the audience<br />\nbe permitted to join in with the<br />\nquestions. People didn't come to<br />\nsee Thompson the alleged<br />\njournalist, they wanted<br />\nThompson the cult figure, Duke<br />\nof Doonesbury fame. One even<br />\nexpected Zonker to make a quick<br />\nside entrance, ready to fill his<br />\n\"uncle's\" whiskey glass.<br />\nEven though the Wheels<br />\nstruggled to confine Thompson's<br />\nremarks to politics and<br />\njournalism, Duke was able to<br />\ndigress often enough to evoke<br /><br />\ninstant guffaws and howls from<br />\nhis many admirers. He would<br />\nmumble something totally<br />\npredictable like,\"Ah, Humphrey,<br />\nthat no good swine,\" and zoom,<br />\nhalf the audience was yukking it<br />\nup.<br />\nBut the real hero worshipping<br />\nwas reserved for the reception in<br />\nthe Clipper Room. Thompson<br />\nand his entourage climbed ever so<br />\ngingerly up the stairs, into the<br />\nswarm of fans. Immediately, he<br />\nwas beseiged with dope-growing<br />\nhints, lit hash pipes and the finest<br />\nacid this side of Charles St.<br />\nHunter whispered to his aides in<br />\nrambling slurred speech, \"Hey<br />\nget me to the window, too<br />\ncrowded here, get me some air.\"<br />\nAnd sure enough, his loyal<br />\nkeepers took him to the window,<br />\nassuring him that he wasn't too<br />\nburned out to face the crowd.<br />\nBut those looking for a crazed<br />\nThompson found exactly that.<br />\nHands trembling as he<br />\nchain-smoked Dunhills, his eyes<br />\nshifted nervously around the<br />\nroom as he asked his aides<br />\nquestions like \"Can I turn around<br />\nnow, nothing behind me, are you<br />\nsure it's all right;\" and quickly,<br />\nhis keepers responded \"yeah, it's<br />\nall right Hunter, don't worry.\"<br />\nPut-on<br />\nHe might have been putting us<br />\non. It seemed a wee bit<br />\norchestrated, like he pulled the<br />\nsame tricks at each college<br />\naudience, satisfying his fans with<br />\na stoned front. They hung on his<br />\nevery word and nodded with<br />\ndeep understanding when his<br />\nsecretary threw out tired lines<br />\nlike, \"Well, Hunter isn't like any<br />\nother writer. No, he can't be<br />\nforced to write, he just does it,<br />\nand when it happens it's always<br />\ngreat, there's no one like him.\"<br />\nOf course, it doesn't really<br />\nmatter if Thompson's act was<br />\nstaged or real. People wanted to<br />\nsee the legendary drug-crazed<br />\nwriter, someone they understood<br />\nand could identify with.

To take a poke at the<br />\ntitles used by large newspapers<br />\nand magazines, Thompson<br />\ngranted himself an honorary<br />\ndoctorate in \"Gonzo\"<br />\njournalism, \"the only good kind<br />\naround,\" and established the<br />\n\"National Affairs suite,\" which<br />\nwas whatever hotel room he<br />\nhappened to be staying in at that<br />\npoint in his coverage.<br />\nBut in the end, Thompson is<br />\ndistinguished from his more'<br />\nconservative colleagues. by his<br />\nacrimonious prose-, a style which<br />\nseems to spring from some vast<br />\nwell of pent-up hatred.<br />\nIn his campaign coverage,<br />\nThompson wrote that he was so<br />\nsick of listening to Hubert<br /><br />\nHumphrey's speeches that he was<br />\nperfecting a \"million pound shit<br />\nhammer\" with which he planned<br />\nto \"knock some sense into the<br />\nman's head.\"<br />\nHe later said of Humphrey,<br />\n\"Someone should drive a stake<br />\nthrough that man's heart.\"<br />\nAsked yesterday if he still feels<br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n.0\"<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\nthe same way about he<br />\nMinnesota senator, he replied,<br />\n\"Hubert Humphrey is the foulest<br />\nswine ever to be catapulted out<br />\nof the gutter into politics on the<br />\nnational scene, and he wouldn't<br />\nknow the truth if it crawled up<br />\nhis leg and bit his kneecap off.\"<br />\nThough several spectators left<br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\nthe audience yesterday after<br />\nhearing this stream of bitter<br />\nepithets, the great majority<br />\nreveled in the spectacle, asking<br />\nThompson questions about<br />\nspecifics of his past, addressing ,<br />\nhim humbly as the honorific \"Dr.<br />\nThompson.\"<br />\nSpeaking about his future in<br />\njournalism, he professed great<br />\nskepticism about the upcoming<br />\nPresidential election, expressing<br />\n\"the sincere conviction that .1<br />\nwon't have to cover it again.\"<br />\n\"After a year of covering some<br />\nof the most contemptible beasts<br />\nI've ever laid eyes on,\" he<br />\nexplained, \"I'm not too anxious<br />\nto do it again.\"<br />\n\"I find the best way to handle<br />\nreality is to describe it as<br />\naccurately as possible\u2014it's the<br />\nonly way to keep your head.\"<br />\nAt his reception in the Clipper Room, Thompson was<br />\nsurrounded by awe-struck<br />\nadmirers who shook the good<br />\ndoctor's hand, applauding his.<br />\ncourage, envying his insight.

If you<br />\ninclude sports, Hopkins has the<br />\nbest lacrosse program and team<br />\nfrom coast to coast.<br />\nBut one area where the<br />\nUniversity could use some<br />\ndefinite modernization and<br />\nimprovement is the Homewood<br />\nplaying fields. Basking in the<br />\nshadow of the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center, a facility that is<br />\nremarkable in size .and scope for<br />\na university the size of Hopkins,<br />\nlies an antiquated and old<br />\nHomewood Field.<br />\nWhy , should anyone make<br />\ncomplaints over such a seemingly<br />\nnon-issue? The reason is simple.<br />\nWith millions of dollars pouring<br /><br />\nteams in size in the conference<br />\nand will be able to hold their<br />\nown against anyone.\"<br />\nSluggish<br />\nWhat the Blue Jays hope to do<br />\nis to take advantage of their<br />\nopponents size and relative<br />\nslowness by use of quick hitting<br />\nplays and fast defensive<br />\nreactions.<br />\nHopkins defensive tackles<br />\nWillie Oliver, Bob Moses, and<br />\nGeorge Skegas will be severely<br /><br />\nunchanged since 1922. Granted,<br />\nthe addition of the new athletic<br />\ncenter was certainly a major step<br />\nin improving student resources<br />\non the Homewood campus<br />\n(despite Dr. Eisenhower's claim<br />\nthat the new Student Union was<br />\nthe single greatest improvement).<br />\nBut Homewood Field needs<br />\nplenty of work.<br />\nAccording to Robert Scott,<br />\nDirector of Athletics, an<br />\nexpenditure of $250,000 would<br />\nbe required to loft Hopkins into<br />\nthe twentieth century. Such<br />\nmonies would be used improve<br />\nthe lighting on the field, install a<br />\nnatural turf system of drainage<br />\nand watering and add more<br />\npermanent seating to the existing<br />\nstands. the last item would<br />\neliminate the need to rent<br />\nexpensive temporary seating for<br />\nHomecoming weekend.<br /><br />\nNAME THE JOCKS<br /><br />\nIf you can name all six people in this picture correctly, a case of Johnny Walker Black is yours.

However, a stout<br />\nHopkins defense from goalie Ken<br />\nSeuess and fullbacks Ami Cohen,<br />\nLou Podrazik and frank<br />\nOlszewski kept the game a<br />\nscoreless tie.<br />\nThe Tigers finally pierced the<br />\nhome team armor for the only<br />\ntime all evening at the fifteen<br />\nminute mark of the first stanza.<br />\nA shot towards the Blue Jay goal<br />\nwas slowed down when it glanced<br />\noff a defender and the ensuing<br />\nrace for the ball between Seuess<br />\nand a Towson State forward was<br />\nwon by the latter, who looped it<br />\ninto the goal for a 1-0 lead.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense came to<br />\nlife several minutes later and<br />\nbegan to put sonic pressure on<br />\nthe Tiger goalie. Finally, Larry<br />\nMcGowan redirected a Joe<br />\nRutkowski shot past the visiting<br />\nnetminder and the score after the<br />\nfirst forty-five minutes of play<br />\nwas 1-1.<br />\nIn the locker room between<br />\nthe halves, the Blue Jays changed<br />\ntheir offensive strategy.<br />\n\"We decided to pick on their<br />\nwing fullbacks, especially their<br />\nright fullback,\" Homewood<br />\ncoach Bob Oliver later explained.<br />\n\"Fortunately, we adapted to this<br />\nvery well.\"<br />\nThis adjustment apparently<br />\nmade all the difference in the<br />\nworld. Hopkins struck for three<br />\nunanswered goals and consistently<br />\nhad the ball in their offensive end<br />\nof the field.,<br />\nGreg Cunningham opened the<br />\nsecond half scoring when he<br />\nheaded a Lou Podrazik corner<br />\nkick into the net. McGowan then<br />\nnotched his second goal of the<br /><br />\nevening when he took a Gary<br />\nIgnatowski pass and rifled it past<br />\nthe stunned Tiger netkeeper.<br />\nGunningham then closed cout<br />\nthe barrage as he beat the goalie<br />\non an assist from Bob Teasdale.<br />\n\"It was all us in the second<br />\nhalf,\" Oliver declared. \"They had<br />\nno penetration intO our deep<br />\nbackfield.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jay mentor had<br />\npersonal plaudits for several<br />\nmembers of his defensive corps.<br />\nHe commented that the play of<br />\nAmi Cohen was \"the finest. since<br />\nhe's been here at Hopkins\" and<br />\nnoted \"the excellent job done by<br />\nKen Seuess in only his second<br />\ngame in the goal.\"<br />\nOliver called Monday night's<br />\nteam practice under the lights a<br />\nkey to his squad's preparation for<br />\nthe game.<br />\n\"It was a fast paced hour<br />\nscrimmage,\" the Coach said.<br />\n\"Our second string did an<br />\nexcellent job of playing the role<br />\nof.
