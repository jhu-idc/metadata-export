Some<br />\nsuch there are and they should be<br />\nencouraged and helped, while others<br />\nwill probably become junior colleges of the type fast springing up<br />\nthroughout that part of the country.<br />\nIn the eastern part of the country<br />\nthe position of the independent colleges is quite different. They have<br />\npreserved and maintained their traditions, and their graduates find<br />\nthemselves at home with others in<br />\nthe professional schools of the<br />\nneighboring universities whose students by rule or in practice are holders of a bachelor's degree. The function of those colleges is, as it always<br />\nhas been, essentially the same as that<br />\nof the four-year cultural college in<br />\na university, to give a general education of high grade. In doing so<br />\ntheir situation is in some ways less,<br />\nand in others more, favorable than<br />\nthese. The university from the size<br />\nof its faculties is able to offer a<br />\nwider range of opportunity, and can<br />\ncommand the services of more eminent professors, although it is the<br />\nfashion for some men to prefer<br />\nteaching only students in the graduate school, in other words, prospective teachers. On the other hand,<br />\nthe independent college is better<br />\nplaced for inducing a close contact<br />\nbetween the students and the instructing staff, which we are striving to bring about in universities by<br />\nvarious devices, among them the<br />\nsubdividing of the undergraduate<br />\nbody into Houses.<br />\nThere is no reason why the independent college should not attract<br />\nas able a corps of professors as it<br />\n<br />\nwants, as good, for example, as the<br />\naverage of tutors at Oxford, or the<br />\ncorresponding supervisors of studies<br />\nat Cambridge. To do so three<br />\nchanges are needed. First, to increase the salaries above the present level; not inevitably to that of<br />\nthe universities which are generally<br />\nin cities where the cost of living is<br />\nhigher. Second, to avoid the common but mistaken practice of setting the young Ph.D., inexperienced<br />\nin teaching, to give the most difficult of all instruction, lecturing to<br />\nlarge classes of freshmen. Third,<br />\nand most important of all, to reduce<br />\nthe load of the instructing staff and<br />\nto provide them with occasional<br />\nleaves of absence to libraries and<br />\nlaboratories elsewhere, so as to facilitate and encourage productive<br />\nscholarship on their part. This has<br />\na great influence on attracting ambitious men. It costs something, but<br />\nnot an excessive amount if the students, instead of relying on their<br />\nteachers for everything, are induced<br />\nto work more on their own account,<br />\nto understand that all true development on the higher planes comes<br />\nfrom personal effort, and that they<br />\nshould acquire under guidance in<br />\ncollege the art and the habit of selfeducation.<br />\n<br />\nJays Blank Gettysburg 7-0 In Winning Third Victory Of Present<br />\nSeason<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday at 2.30 the Hopkins<br />\nnetmen will meet the William and<br />\nMary tennis team on the Homewood<br />\ncourts.

His talk 'Economics<br />\nand War\" was presented at the request of the Women's International<br />\nLeague for Peace and Freedom, the<br />\ngroup which is making efforts to reinforce the public's favorable attitude toward the coming plenary Disarmament Conference.<br />\n\"There is need enough to rally<br />\nnational sentiment for peace,\" said<br />\nDr. Mitchell. \"There are strong<br />\ngroups working in every country,<br />\nwhether they say so or not, for war.<br />\nThey want more armaments\u2014sometimes they are military or naval men<br />\nwho take a narrow professional<br />\niiew, sometimes they are demogogue<br />\npoliticians who try to get votes by<br />\nwaving the flag, far too often they<br />\nare `patrioteers' who persuade themselves that the glory of one nation<br />\nis measured by the injury of other<br />\nnations.<br />\n\"Those who want peace must organize against powerful propagandists for war. We must let our<br />\nvoices be heard at the table of the<br />\nDisarmament Conference\u2014be heard<br />\nabove the compromises and bickerings and evasions and timidities of<br />\nthe official conferees. We must<br />\nstand for the uncontestable principles of peace, and give the country's<br />\nrepresentatives a mandate to work<br />\nout the details so far as reduction<br />\nof armaments looks to that end.\"<br />\nEconomics, Housekeeping<br />\n<br />\nEconomics, the Hopkins professor declared, is merely national and<br />\ninternational housekeeping, housekeeping which proceeds often with<br />\nfights.<br />\n\"You may be reminding yourselves of the old saying that 'competition is the life of trade.'

LEE<br /><br />\nSpecial Attention Given to Students<br /><br />\nHopkins Tennis Team<br />\nMeets Indians Friday<br /><br />\nindependent college after two years<br />\nand enter a university is great;<br />\nand only the strongest colleges seem<br />\nlikely to stand the pressure. Some<br />\nsuch there are and they should be<br />\nencouraged and helped, while others<br />\nwill probably become junior colleges of the type fast springing up<br />\nthroughout that part of the country.<br />\nIn the eastern part of the country<br />\nthe position of the independent colleges is quite different. They have<br />\npreserved and maintained their traditions, and their graduates find<br />\nthemselves at home with others in<br />\nthe professional schools of the<br />\nneighboring universities whose students by rule or in practice are holders of a bachelor's degree. The function of those colleges is, as it always<br />\nhas been, essentially the same as that<br />\nof the four-year cultural college in<br />\na university, to give a general education of high grade. In doing so<br />\ntheir situation is in some ways less,<br />\nand in others more, favorable than<br />\nthese. The university from the size<br />\nof its faculties is able to offer a<br />\nwider range of opportunity, and can<br />\ncommand the services of more eminent professors, although it is the<br />\nfashion for some men to prefer<br />\nteaching only students in the graduate school, in other words, prospective teachers. On the other hand,<br />\nthe independent college is better<br />\nplaced for inducing a close contact<br />\nbetween the students and the instructing staff, which we are striving to bring about in universities by<br />\nvarious devices, among them the<br />\nsubdividing of the undergraduate<br />\nbody into Houses.<br />\nThere is no reason why the independent college should not attract<br />\nas able a corps of professors as it<br /><br />\nwants, as good, for example, as the<br />\naverage of tutors at Oxford, or the<br />\ncorresponding supervisors of studies<br />\nat Cambridge. To do so three<br />\nchanges are needed. First, to increase the salaries above the present level; not inevitably to that of<br />\nthe universities which are generally<br />\nin cities where the cost of living is<br />\nhigher. Second, to avoid the common but mistaken practice of setting the young Ph.D., inexperienced<br />\nin teaching, to give the most difficult of all instruction, lecturing to<br />\nlarge classes of freshmen. Third,<br />\nand most important of all, to reduce<br />\nthe load of the instructing staff and<br />\nto provide them with occasional<br />\nleaves of absence to libraries and<br />\nlaboratories elsewhere, so as to facilitate and encourage productive<br />\nscholarship on their part. This has<br />\na great influence on attracting ambitious men. It costs something, but<br />\nnot an excessive amount if the students, instead of relying on their<br />\nteachers for everything, are induced<br />\nto work more on their own account,<br />\nto understand that all true development on the higher planes comes<br />\nfrom personal effort, and that they<br />\nshould acquire under guidance in<br />\ncollege the art and the habit of selfeducation.<br /><br />\nJays Blank Gettysburg 7-0 In Winning Third Victory Of Present<br />\nSeason<br /><br />\nOn Friday at 2.30 the Hopkins<br />\nnetmen will meet the William and<br />\nMary tennis team on the Homewood<br />\ncourts.
