McKEY<br />\nThere was once a student,<br />\nHerman Greenbaum by name.<br />\nHerman was a student at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University,<br />\nthough the dates of his<br />\nenrollment period must be<br />\nconcealed out of respect to his<br />\nfamily.<br />\nHerman was always extremely<br />\nconscientious where his<br />\nschoolwork was concerned, but<br />\nespecially so during exam weeks.<br />\nAs exam weeks neared for the<br />\nfirst semester of his freshman<br />\nyear, Herman began preparing for<br />\nthem diligently. A typical day for<br />\nhim went something like this: he<br />\nwould wake up in the morning<br />\nand go to all his classes, usually<br />\ncarrying a large number of books<br />\nwith him so he could study a<br />\nlittle between classtimes. With<br />\nclasses over for the day, he would<br />\neat a leisurely dinner, always<br />\ncareful not to upset his digestion.<br />\n<br />\nreject<br />\n<br />\nAfter dinner, Herman would<br />\nlock himself into his room for<br />\nabout two hours and complete all<br />\nhis homework. By this time his<br />\nroommate (about whom I will<br />\nsay much more later) had usually<br />\nshown up, and Herman would<br />\ngather up his calculus and<br />\nchemistry books and descend to<br />\nD-level in the library where he<br />\nwould prepare for his final<br />\nexams.<br />\nWhile engaged in this<br />\npreparation, Herman would let<br />\nnothing distract him, lest an<br />\nimportant detail should escape<br />\nhis notice. Just how intent he<br />\nwas can in fact be illustrated by<br />\nthe telling of a rather unusual<br />\nanecdote. It occurred one night<br />\nafter Herman had been studying<br />\nabout half an hour. A short,<br />\npimply fellow was sitting at the<br />\nopposite end of the table. He had<br />\nbeen sweating profusely all night.<br />\nand now he began' to shiver. He<br />\n<br />\nAfter six months of dispute, it appeared that the<br />\nquestion of student discipline was finally going to be<br />\nsettled Wednesday afternoon at the meeting of the<br />\nHomewood Advisory Council. The Council was going to<br />\nbe presented with the final Student Council plan,<br />\nworked out over six weeks of bitter debate, the HAC<br />\nwas going to ratify it, and send it to President Muller,<br />\nand the controversy was going to be over.<br />\nBut it didn't work out that way, because Homewood<br />\nVice-President George Benton wanted to add a clause to<br />\nthe code re -affirming the Board of Trustees' final<br />\nauthority in all disciplinary matters, and the HAC went<br />\nalong. While there is no doubt that as the ultimate legal<br />\nauthority in the University, the Board of Trustees in<br />\ngeneral has the power to review any actions taken in the<br />\nname of the institution, for any disciplinary procedure<br />\nto retain its credibility, decisions made pursuant to it<br />\nmust be irreversible.<br />\nNow that the SC's simple and sensible proposal has<br />\nbeen modified, the whole matter is back where it was six<br />\nmonths ago, when the controversy started. Now that the<br />\nAppeals Board, designed to be the final authority in<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\ndiscipline matters, has lost its autonomy, there seems to<br />\nLast night at Levering Hall, the<br />\nbe little reason for it to exist at all. For the University Flying Monkey Concert Series<br />\nto expect students to accept the plan is absurd, because offered the Hopkins community<br />\nthe original intent of a disciplinary code was to protect several hours of enjoyable and<br />\nstudents from capricious actions against them on the professionally presented acoustic<br />\nrock music free of charge.<br />\npart of the University. Now that the proposal emphasizes<br />\nAs was to be expected,<br />\nthat the code can be reversed or ignored by the Trustees, scarcely thirty students chose to<br />\ntake advantage of this veritable<br />\nthat protection has evaporated.<br />\ncornucopia<br />\nof compositional<br />\nWhile it is likely true that very few students will<br />\noriginality, the remainder being<br />\never be affected by the discipline code and its<br />\npresumably too busy with<br />\nprocedures, and that even fewer will ever see a decision<br />\ncontinental traversals or scholarly<br />\npursuits to engage in such plebian<br />\naffecting them reversed by the Board of Trustees, there<br />\nactivities as leisure aria<br />\nis no justification whatever for setting up a system that<br />\nenjoyment.

For the<br />\nfirst time in the three-year<br />\nhistory of the event, all games<br />\nwill be played in Gym no. 2 on<br />\nthe University of Maryland<br />\nBaltimore County campus,<br />\none-half mile out from Beltway<br />\nexit 12. The Jays, seeded fourth,<br />\nrun into the Bees from the<br />\nUniversity of Baltimore in their<br />\nopening contest.<br />\nThe Schaefer Tourney pits<br />\nseven Baltimore area schools<br />\nagainst one another over a<br />\nthree-day span. As a<br />\nseason-opening event for all<br />\nteams, the tourney has become<br />\nsynonymous with exciting<br />\nbasketball. Nine of the previous<br />\neighteen games played have<br />\neither gone into overtime or have<br />\nbeen decided by one point.<br />\nHopkins is hoping to improve<br />\nupon last year's fifth-place finish<br />\nwhich included wins over Coppin<br />\nState and U.M.B.C. following an<br />\nopening round heartbreaker with<br />\nTowson State. Many felt the<br />\nlimited press appeal of<br />\nconsolation games kept Blue Jay<br />\nforward Bill Jews of the<br />\nAll-Tournament team, so it is<br />\nhoped that a higher finish this<br />\nyear will provide additional<br />\nindividual recognition.<br />\nThe Blue Jays have no easy<br />\npath to this year's crown,<br />\nhowever, as the Bees should<br />\nprovide stiff competition in the<br />\n<br />\nfirst round. Traditionally a<br />\nhotbed of talent from<br />\nPhiladelphia and Baltimore, B.U.<br />\nreturns All-Tourney selection<br />\nCarl Kenty and All-Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference pick Fran<br />\nJamrogowicz. Top-flight<br />\nfreshmen and junior college<br />\ntransfers are aded to make a team<br />\nlacking height but loaded with<br />\nspeed.<br />\nThe winner of tonight's<br />\nmatchup is a \"loser\" of sorts, as<br />\nthey must play top-seeded<br />\nMorgan State in the showcase<br />\ncontest Saturday at 9 p.m.<br />\nMorgan, the defending Schaefer<br />\nTourney champion, is led by the<br />\n\"Human Eraser,\" 7-0 Marvin<br />\nWebster. The Edmondson High<br />\ngraduate earned All-American<br />\nstatus last season as a sophomore.<br />\nas well as winning the Schaefer<br />\nTourney's MVP award. Webster<br />\nhas filled out his frame over the<br />\noff-season with 35 additional<br />\npounds and is expected to be an<br />\neven greater shot-blockingsartist<br />\nthis season than his 10 stops per<br />\ngame average in the past. The<br />\nBlue Jays would have their hands<br />\nfull with Webster alone, but<br />\nMorgan starts two 6-7 wingmen<br />\nto compound the problem.<br />\nLower Seeds<br />\nIf Hopkins can get to the final<br />\nround, they must face the winner<br />\nfrom the lower bracket that<br />\nincludes Coppin, Towson, Loyola<br />\nand U.M.B.C.

The big<br />\ndisappointment to the organizers,<br />\n<br />\nwho were trying to attract the<br />\nwhole Hopkins community, was<br />\nthe fact that only a half dozen<br />\nfaculty members attended.<br />\nAmong those attending were<br />\nseveral members of the 1948<br />\nfootball team who were<br />\ncelebrating the 25th anniversary<br />\nof their 7-1 season when they<br />\nwere Mason-Dixon champs. That<br />\nsquad turned down an invitation<br />\nto the Tangerine Bowl, the only<br />\nbowl bid ever received by a Blue<br />\nJay eleven.<br />\nFollowing the success of this<br />\nBull Roast, the social affair will<br />\nbecome an annual event.

A typical day for<br />\nhim went something like this: he<br />\nwould wake up in the morning<br />\nand go to all his classes, usually<br />\ncarrying a large number of books<br />\nwith him so he could study a<br />\nlittle between classtimes. With<br />\nclasses over for the day, he would<br />\neat a leisurely dinner, always<br />\ncareful not to upset his digestion.<br /><br />\nreject<br /><br />\nAfter dinner, Herman would<br />\nlock himself into his room for<br />\nabout two hours and complete all<br />\nhis homework. By this time his<br />\nroommate (about whom I will<br />\nsay much more later) had usually<br />\nshown up, and Herman would<br />\ngather up his calculus and<br />\nchemistry books and descend to<br />\nD-level in the library where he<br />\nwould prepare for his final<br />\nexams.<br />\nWhile engaged in this<br />\npreparation, Herman would let<br />\nnothing distract him, lest an<br />\nimportant detail should escape<br />\nhis notice. Just how intent he<br />\nwas can in fact be illustrated by<br />\nthe telling of a rather unusual<br />\nanecdote. It occurred one night<br />\nafter Herman had been studying<br />\nabout half an hour. A short,<br />\npimply fellow was sitting at the<br />\nopposite end of the table. He had<br />\nbeen sweating profusely all night.<br />\nand now he began' to shiver. He<br /><br />\nAfter six months of dispute, it appeared that the<br />\nquestion of student discipline was finally going to be<br />\nsettled Wednesday afternoon at the meeting of the<br />\nHomewood Advisory Council. The Council was going to<br />\nbe presented with the final Student Council plan,<br />\nworked out over six weeks of bitter debate, the HAC<br />\nwas going to ratify it, and send it to President Muller,<br />\nand the controversy was going to be over.<br />\nBut it didn't work out that way, because Homewood<br />\nVice-President George Benton wanted to add a clause to<br />\nthe code re -affirming the Board of Trustees' final<br />\nauthority in all disciplinary matters, and the HAC went<br />\nalong. While there is no doubt that as the ultimate legal<br />\nauthority in the University, the Board of Trustees in<br />\ngeneral has the power to review any actions taken in the<br />\nname of the institution, for any disciplinary procedure<br />\nto retain its credibility, decisions made pursuant to it<br />\nmust be irreversible.<br />\nNow that the SC's simple and sensible proposal has<br />\nbeen modified, the whole matter is back where it was six<br />\nmonths ago, when the controversy started. Now that the<br />\nAppeals Board, designed to be the final authority in<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\ndiscipline matters, has lost its autonomy, there seems to<br />\nLast night at Levering Hall, the<br />\nbe little reason for it to exist at all. For the University Flying Monkey Concert Series<br />\nto expect students to accept the plan is absurd, because offered the Hopkins community<br />\nthe original intent of a disciplinary code was to protect several hours of enjoyable and<br />\nstudents from capricious actions against them on the professionally presented acoustic<br />\nrock music free of charge.<br />\npart of the University. Now that the proposal emphasizes<br />\nAs was to be expected,<br />\nthat the code can be reversed or ignored by the Trustees, scarcely thirty students chose to<br />\ntake advantage of this veritable<br />\nthat protection has evaporated.<br />\ncornucopia<br />\nof compositional<br />\nWhile it is likely true that very few students will<br />\noriginality, the remainder being<br />\never be affected by the discipline code and its<br />\npresumably too busy with<br />\nprocedures, and that even fewer will ever see a decision<br />\ncontinental traversals or scholarly<br />\npursuits to engage in such plebian<br />\naffecting them reversed by the Board of Trustees, there<br />\nactivities as leisure aria<br />\nis no justification whatever for setting up a system that<br />\nenjoyment.

President Muller should reject this plan.<br />\nHopkins scholars from their William of Orange.<br /><br />\nshivered harder and harder. He<br />\nshivered so hard that books and<br />\nashtrays vibrated off of the table<br />\nand clattered to the floor. His<br />\nglasses fell off, and he began to<br />\nfoam at the mouth, the saliva<br />\ndripping off his lip, running<br />\ndown his shirtfront and down his<br />\npants leg. He went on this way<br />\nfor about two minutes when<br />\nsuddenly his eyes rolled up into<br />\nhis head and he let out a loud,<br />\nlong blosid curdling scream.<br />\nThen, ripping a 'calculus book in<br />\nhalf (lengthwise) he jumped up<br />\nand ran out of the place, crashing<br />\nfull force into a bookshelf. All<br />\nthis is neither here nor there<br />\nexcept to show how Herman<br />\nacted when the fit of study was<br />\nupon him, for he remained<br />\nunmoved during all this activity.<br />\nHerman's roommate,. however,<br />\na fellow by the name of Ralph<br />\nWeinstein, had no such strength<br />\nof character, though he was a<br /><br />\nvery bright buy. He didn't study<br />\nmuch, and was in fact a master of<br />\nthe art of procrastination. Ralph<br />\ndidn't even have a major, being a<br />\n999 (undecided). Ralph studied<br />\nvery seldom, spending most of<br />\nhis time doing such things as<br />\nplaying with an Etch-a-sketch,<br />\ntaking weird pictures with an<br />\nexpensive camera and taking<br />\ndrugs. When exam week rolled<br />\naround, Ralph spent about as<br />\nmuch time studying for his finals.<br />\nas I did for my French final, that<br />\nis about forty-five minutes with<br />\nthe T.V. on<br />\nStuffed Brains<br />\nHerman, who had been<br />\nstuffing his brains for the past<br />\nthree weeks, breezed through his<br />\nexams with little or no difficulty.<br />\nHe did so well, in fact, that on<br />\nthe last day of his exams, after all<br />\nhis tests were over, he decided to<br />\ntake a walk and figure out how<br />\nto occupy his mind in the coming<br /><br />\nFlying Monkey Concert Series continues<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nCynthia Kinnard's is sponsored Snooper's defense fund.

I<br />\nthink they would be surprised to<br />\nlearn that the course had never<br />\nbeen taught before.<br />\nCertainly their responses<br />\nwould be a better guide to the<br />\ncourse than what is printed: \"a<br />\nreview of another 'women's<br />\nstudies' course taught last year<br />\nby Emily Toth.\" That course is<br />\nnot even named.

What is<br />\nthe source of the statement that<br />\n\"Women's Center-sponsored<br />\ncourses'' cannot be<br />\nrecommended for a \"true<br />\neducation?\"<br />\nI certainly do believe in \"true<br />\neducation.\" I also think it must<br />\ninclude a tiue presentation of the<br />\nfacts: neither my course nor<br /><br />\n, Fictions.\"<br /><br />\nckaA walttle v._<br />\nregular hours and is extremely<br /><br />\nFinally, the Course Guide courteous.<br />\nSAVE OUR SNOOPER.

But, since a case of<br /><br />\nstudent discipline by the<br />\nUniversity hasn't arisen in three<br />\nyears, the HAC members, fairly<br />\nconfident that the code could be<br />\nmodified if the need arises and<br />\nthus willing to give the code a<br />\ntry, passed the proposal.<br />\n.Bent-On<br />\nAt the suggestion of Benton,<br />\nthe HAC also voted to permit<br />\nonly the faculty and student<br />\nmembers of the Council to vote<br />\non the conduct code proposal,<br />\nsince according to Benton, the<br />\nproposal directly affects only<br />\nthose groups.<br /><br />\nOR ENGAGED IN A FILMIC HIGH NOON<br />\nWHICH PREPARATIONS WERE<br />\nSOON INTERRUPTED BY REVERIES SHOWDOWN WITH DIRTY JOHN,<br />\nOF CINEMATIC CELEBRITY.
