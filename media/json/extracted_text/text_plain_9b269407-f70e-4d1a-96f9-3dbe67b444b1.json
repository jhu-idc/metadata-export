INTRODUCTION<br />\nThis manual is intended to aid you in looking for an apartment,<br />\nrenting an apartment and living in an apartment. It is important for<br />\ntenants to know what their rights are, and who to turn to if you run<br />\ninto problems. We hope you find it useful. We plan to expand and<br />\nimprove it in the future. Please let us know what you think and how<br />\nwe can make it better. Drop us a line in Campus mail. Write Hopkins<br />\nMaryPIRG, Student Activity Center, Levering Hall.<br />\nII. WHAT ARE YOUR REQUIREMENTS FOR RENTING AN<br />\nAPARTMENT<br />\nBefore you even begin to look for an apartment, it is important<br />\nthat you realize your needs and limitations.<br />\n1. What do you want to pay for rent? For furniture?<br />\n2. Where do you want to live? Within walking distance?<br />\n3. Will you have a roommate?<br />\n4. How many bedrooms do you want?<br />\n5. What services would you like to be offered? Parking? Washing<br />\nmachines and dryers? Security'?<br />\n6. Would it be feasible for you to rent the apartment for one<br />\nyear'? Will you be staying through the summer? Can you sublet?<br />\nIII. DISCRIMINATION<br />\nThere are cases where landlords discriminate because of race, sex,<br />\nstudents. If you run up against such a problem, report this landlord<br />\nto MaryP1RG and also call a lawyer at:<br />\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union<br />\n1231 N. Calvert St.<br />\n685-5195<br />\nLawyer Referral<br />\n539-0065 Also it is imperative that you cal HUD (Housing &<br />\nUrban Development).<br />\n962-2520<br />\nIV. CONDITION OF THE APARTMENT - A CHECKLIST<br />\nIs the apartment near a drugstore, a grocery store, and other<br />\nfrequented businesses? If not, can you get to the stores located<br />\nfarther away'?<br />\nIs the door sturdy and well enough equipped with locks, etc. to<br />\nbe secure?<br />\nIs the apartment on an upper floor? How much of a hassle will it<br />\nbe to move in furniture?<br />\nAre there water problems in the apartment? In other words does<br />\nthe roof leak? Watch out for telltale fresh coatings of paint that<br />\nmight cover up leaks. In a basement apartment, does the place smell<br />\ndamp'? Will paint stay on the wall? A poorly drained basement can<br />\nmean ruined furniture and possibly an unhealthy climate.<br />\nDo you have your own thermostat in your apartment? Will you<br />\nbe able to adjust the heat yourself(not just radiator knobs but with<br />\nreal control).<br />\nWhat's covered in the rent? Are the utilities covered - water, gas<br />\nelectricity? Who pays for these things?<br />\nIs the water pressure adequate? Turn on the taps and possibly the<br />\nshower. Flush the toilet. If the gushing tap turns into a trickle, you<br />\nmay have trouble when your neighbor takes a shower or flushes his<br />\ntoilet.<br />\nV. RENTING AN APARTMENT<br />\n(A) Before renting an apartment, always inspect the premises for<br />\ncommon housing code violations. (B) Always make sure you get a<br />\ncopy of your lease. Make sure you read it carefully before you sign<br />\nit.<br />\nMake sure all the blanks are filled in as agreed upon.<br />\nLook for late fee, provisions (if there. is no fine specified in the<br />\nlease, the landlord has no right to ask for one).<br />\nSecurity Deposits<br />\n(A) This is to protect the landlord against non-payment of rent or<br />\ndamage. The security deposit may not exceed two month's rent or<br />\n$50, whichever is greater. (B) The landlord must give you a reciept<br />\nfor a security deposit or must return $25 if he does not give a<br />\nreciept and if you request a description of all existing damage, he<br />\nmust give it to you. Ask for this, it will protect you against false<br />\ndamage claims a landlord may make against your security deposit<br />\nwhen you move out.(C) The landlord is required to pay you back<br />\n3% simple interest on your security deposit when you move out,<br />\nand the deposit plus interest must be returned within 45 days after<br />\nyou leave. (D) If the landlord fails to attempt to notify the tenant,<br />\nat his last known address, within 30 days after termination of his<br />\ntenancy, of reasons of withholding the security deposit. the landlord<br />\nloses the right to withhold the deposit to offset damages.<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\neNS<br />\n<br />\nThe Housing Code<br />\n(A) Responsibilities of the Landlord<br />\n1. He must know and comply with regulations determining how<br />\nmany people may occupy any particular dwelling. There must be<br />\nclosets, kitchen, bath and adequate space for sleeping. No one may<br />\nsleep in the kitchen.<br />\n2. He is responsible for the safety and maintenance of the interior and the exterior of the structure.<br />\n3. He must provide and maintain facilities and utilities including<br />\nheat, plumbing (toilet, sinks, sewage disposal), water (including<br />\nhot), lights, electrical outlets and proper ventilation (windows). It<br />\nmust be possible to maintain an average temperature of 70 degrees<br />\nduring the day and not less than 60 degrees at night from Oct. 1 to<br />\nMay 1.<br />\n4. He must provide adequate protection against rodents, insects<br />\nand vermin.<br />\n5. He must maintain cleanliness of all common areas and provide<br />\nreceptacles for storage of trash, garbage and ashes in dwellings of 3<br />\nor more families.<br />\n6. He must post in a conspicuous place the name, address and<br />\ntelephone number of the owner or a responsible person.<br />\n(B) Responsibilities of the Tenant<br />\n1. He must not overcrowd the apartment.<br />\n2. He must not destroy, deface or damage his dwelling.<br />\n3. He must keep all exits clear at all times.<br />\n4. He must deposit garbage and trash in proper containers and not<br />\nin gutters or alleys.<br />\n5. He must allow the landlord entry at all reasonable times to<br />\nmake repairs or inspection to comply with the building code.<br />\n6. He must notify the landlord 3 days before he moves out, leave<br />\nthe dwelling clean and return the keys 24 hours after leaving.<br />\nIf the tenant thinks there is a violation in his house that should be<br />\ncorrected, he can report it directly to the Department of Housing<br />\nand Community Development(HCD)in Baltimore.<br />\nVI. RENT ESCROW LAW<br />\nWhen a landlord refuses to repair a condition which constitutes or<br />\nwill constitute a serious threat to the life, health or safety of the<br />\ntenant or which constitutes a fire hazard, the tenant has the right to<br />\ninitiate actions against the landlord's failure to repair dangerous<br />\nconditions.<br />\nFor example:<br />\nI. Lack of hot or cold running water.<br />\n2. Lack of heat, light or electricity.<br />\n3. Lack of adequate sewage facilities.<br />\n4. Presence of rats or mice.<br />\n5. Presence of lead paint.<br />\nThe tenant may take an affirmative procedure. To this he must:<br />\n1. Send a certified letter to the landlord describing the defective<br />\ncondition (so the tenant will have a \"Return receipt\"; also you<br />\nshould retain a copy of the letter).<br />\n2. The landlord must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to<br />\nmake repairs(not in excess of 30 days).<br />\n3. If the landlord fails to make the repairs, the tenant can then<br />\nfile an action and withhold rent from the landlord while paying the<br />\nmoney into a court account.<br />\n4. A hearing will follow leaving the landlord an opportunity to<br />\nreply to the action.<br />\n5. If the repairs are found to be necessary, the tenant will then<br />\npay his rent to Escrow account. The Rent Escrow law authorizes<br />\nthat the account may be paid out for the specific purpose of making<br />\nbadly needed repairs.<br />\na) In the judgment of the court, either the landlord or the tenant<br />\nmay utilize the withheld money to make necessary repairs.<br />\nb) If no repairs are made 6 months later, the money in the account is returned to the tenant, or rent may be abated by an<br />\namount determined by the court to equitably represent the conditions found to exist.<br />\nIf the lease term is one year or less, an alternative to the affirmative action procedure is:<br />\nI. The tenant sends a certified letter to the landlord (keeping the<br />\nreciept and a copy of the letter).<br />\n2. If the landlord fails to make the repairs within 30 days the<br />\ntenant stops paying rent but the tenant keeps the rent money to pay<br />\nto the court w.hen required.<br />\n3. The tenant will receive a summons to appear in rent court as<br />\nthe landlord will seek to<br />\nevict, you for nonpayment of rent. In court<br />\nthe tenant presents the<br />\ncourt with a copy of the<br />\nletter sent to the landlord, the receipt and all<br />\nthe rent money he has<br />\nwithheld.<br />\n4. If the court finds<br />\nthe Rent Escrow Law applies, the procedure will<br />\nbe as in the positive affirmative action.<br />\nVII. EVICTION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT<br />\nIf a tenant receives a notice from the court to appear for \"summary ejectment\" proceedings, he must attend, but seek advice first.<br />\nEVICTIONS CAN BE VERY SPEEDY. What the landlord will have<br />\ndone is:<br />\nI. Landlord may request a written complaint for back rent due.<br />\nHe may request this as soon as a rent due date- has passed and the<br />\ntenant has failed to pay the rent.<br />\n2. The tenant will receive notice to appear in first class mail<br />\nscheduled 5 court days after the landlord's complaint was filed.<br />\n3. If the landlord wins the case, the tenant will be ordered to<br />\nleave the dwelling within 2 days unless he pays the back rent before<br />\nthat time.<br />\n4. The tenant has to leave. Ply the rent, or he has the rich t of<br />\nappeal.<br />\n<br />\nEviction for Reasons Oilier Than Non-Payment of Rent:<br />\nI. In cases of tenancies fro year to year, the landlord must give the<br />\ntenant 90 days' notice before the end of the year in order to terminate the tenancy.<br />\n2. For tenancies of any other lengths, including month to month<br />\nthe landlord can give the tenant a 60 day NOTICE TO QUIT (notice<br />\nto move out) for any of the following reasons or without giving any<br />\nreason at all:<br />\na) He wants the dwelling for himself.<br />\nb) The dwelling requires substantial remodeling.<br />\nc) The dwelling is being converted to non-housing use.<br />\n3. The landlord must give a 30 day NOT TO QUIT for any of the<br />\nfollowing reasons (he must give a reason):<br />\na) The tenant has denied the landlord reasonable entry to the<br />\napartment.<br />\nb) The dwelling is being used for illegal or immoral purposes.<br />\nc) The lease has expired and the \"principal tenant\" no longer<br />\noccupies the dwelling and the present occupants are sub-tenants.<br />\nVIII.

Not only has the Honor Code been revised, but<br />\nthe previously murky area of student conduct has begun to<br />\nbe clarified. The Honor Code was something of a farce it<br />\nseemed, since some professors ignored its demands upon<br />\nthem and some students cheated iii spite of it. Maybe the<br />\nnew one will work; we'll find out next semester.<br />\nAs far as the question of non-academic conduct goes,<br />\nthere are in any community questions of pilferage, of inflicted injuries and of interference with the rights of others.<br />\nMany communities spend a long time struggling over such<br />\nquestions and many never come up with a satisfactory answer.<br />\nHopkins is trying to remedy that situation with its current consideration of a two-part student conduct and procedure code. The Conduct code is to define whaticonstitutes a violation of University rules and the rights of others<br />\nand the procederural code is to define a means of establishing whether any violation occurred. But the essential problem with such a code is the fact that Hopkins is a private<br />\nuniversity, and as such, the ultimate power in it rests with<br />\nthe President and the Board of Trustees. They may delegate<br />\nwhat powers they see fit to the appropriate officers of the<br />\nUniversity, but they are ultimately responsible for what the<br />\ninstitution does. Thus, any discussion of a review process<br />\nfor complaints about student conduct becomes a little specious. If the University were ever threatened by a serious<br />\nmatter of a student's conduct, such as might occur during a<br />\nstrike, the responsible authorities might act to insure that<br />\nno decision on that student's conduct is made which jeopardizes the institution. On that basis alone, any discipline<br />\ncode suffers from a certain lack of credibility.<br />\n<br />\n3400<br />\n<br />\non<br />\nStage<br />\nphoto essay<br />\nby<br />\nrobert baum,<br />\nbrian blitz,<br />\njohn hynan,<br />\njeff mc erlean<br />\nand<br />\njeff posner<br />\ntext by b. h. cohen<br />\n3400 on Stage, the second<br />\nannual Hopkins spring fair,<br />\nmelange of springtime revelry,<br />\namusement park depravity, and<br />\nschoolday charm, faded into night<br />\nlate Sunday evening, as the Smith<br />\nStreet Society, musicians after a<br />\n<br />\nPresident Savitz at the bat, Garland Hall dwarfed in his magnitude.<br />\nfashion, gave way on the Gilman<br />\nQuadrangle to a half-hour sizzling<br />\nfireworks display.

Write Hopkins<br />\nMaryPIRG, Student Activity Center, Levering Hall.<br />\nII. WHAT ARE YOUR REQUIREMENTS FOR RENTING AN<br />\nAPARTMENT<br />\nBefore you even begin to look for an apartment, it is important<br />\nthat you realize your needs and limitations.<br />\n1. What do you want to pay for rent? For furniture?<br />\n2. Where do you want to live? Within walking distance?<br />\n3. Will you have a roommate?<br />\n4. How many bedrooms do you want?<br />\n5. What services would you like to be offered? Parking? Washing<br />\nmachines and dryers? Security'?<br />\n6. Would it be feasible for you to rent the apartment for one<br />\nyear'? Will you be staying through the summer? Can you sublet?<br />\nIII. DISCRIMINATION<br />\nThere are cases where landlords discriminate because of race, sex,<br />\nstudents. If you run up against such a problem, report this landlord<br />\nto MaryP1RG and also call a lawyer at:<br />\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union<br />\n1231 N. Calvert St.<br />\n685-5195<br />\nLawyer Referral<br />\n539-0065 Also it is imperative that you cal HUD (Housing &amp;<br />\nUrban Development).<br />\n962-2520<br />\nIV. CONDITION OF THE APARTMENT - A CHECKLIST<br />\nIs the apartment near a drugstore, a grocery store, and other<br />\nfrequented businesses? If not, can you get to the stores located<br />\nfarther away'?<br />\nIs the door sturdy and well enough equipped with locks, etc. to<br />\nbe secure?<br />\nIs the apartment on an upper floor? How much of a hassle will it<br />\nbe to move in furniture?<br />\nAre there water problems in the apartment? In other words does<br />\nthe roof leak? Watch out for telltale fresh coatings of paint that<br />\nmight cover up leaks. In a basement apartment, does the place smell<br />\ndamp'? Will paint stay on the wall? A poorly drained basement can<br />\nmean ruined furniture and possibly an unhealthy climate.<br />\nDo you have your own thermostat in your apartment? Will you<br />\nbe able to adjust the heat yourself(not just radiator knobs but with<br />\nreal control).<br />\nWhat's covered in the rent? Are the utilities covered - water, gas<br />\nelectricity? Who pays for these things?<br />\nIs the water pressure adequate? Turn on the taps and possibly the<br />\nshower. Flush the toilet. If the gushing tap turns into a trickle, you<br />\nmay have trouble when your neighbor takes a shower or flushes his<br />\ntoilet.<br />\nV. RENTING AN APARTMENT<br />\n(A) Before renting an apartment, always inspect the premises for<br />\ncommon housing code violations. (B) Always make sure you get a<br />\ncopy of your lease. Make sure you read it carefully before you sign<br />\nit.<br />\nMake sure all the blanks are filled in as agreed upon.<br />\nLook for late fee, provisions (if there. is no fine specified in the<br />\nlease, the landlord has no right to ask for one).<br />\nSecurity Deposits<br />\n(A) This is to protect the landlord against non-payment of rent or<br />\ndamage. The security deposit may not exceed two month's rent or<br />\n$50, whichever is greater. (B) The landlord must give you a reciept<br />\nfor a security deposit or must return $25 if he does not give a<br />\nreciept and if you request a description of all existing damage, he<br />\nmust give it to you. Ask for this, it will protect you against false<br />\ndamage claims a landlord may make against your security deposit<br />\nwhen you move out.(C) The landlord is required to pay you back<br />\n3% simple interest on your security deposit when you move out,<br />\nand the deposit plus interest must be returned within 45 days after<br />\nyou leave. (D) If the landlord fails to attempt to notify the tenant,<br />\nat his last known address, within 30 days after termination of his<br />\ntenancy, of reasons of withholding the security deposit. the landlord<br />\nloses the right to withhold the deposit to offset damages.<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\neNS<br /><br />\nThe Housing Code<br />\n(A) Responsibilities of the Landlord<br />\n1. He must know and comply with regulations determining how<br />\nmany people may occupy any particular dwelling. There must be<br />\nclosets, kitchen, bath and adequate space for sleeping. No one may<br />\nsleep in the kitchen.<br />\n2. He is responsible for the safety and maintenance of the interior and the exterior of the structure.<br />\n3. He must provide and maintain facilities and utilities including<br />\nheat, plumbing (toilet, sinks, sewage disposal), water (including<br />\nhot), lights, electrical outlets and proper ventilation (windows). It<br />\nmust be possible to maintain an average temperature of 70 degrees<br />\nduring the day and not less than 60 degrees at night from Oct. 1 to<br />\nMay 1.<br />\n4. He must provide adequate protection against rodents, insects<br />\nand vermin.<br />\n5. He must maintain cleanliness of all common areas and provide<br />\nreceptacles for storage of trash, garbage and ashes in dwellings of 3<br />\nor more families.<br />\n6. He must post in a conspicuous place the name, address and<br />\ntelephone number of the owner or a responsible person.<br />\n(B) Responsibilities of the Tenant<br />\n1. He must not overcrowd the apartment.<br />\n2. He must not destroy, deface or damage his dwelling.<br />\n3. He must keep all exits clear at all times.<br />\n4. He must deposit garbage and trash in proper containers and not<br />\nin gutters or alleys.<br />\n5. He must allow the landlord entry at all reasonable times to<br />\nmake repairs or inspection to comply with the building code.<br />\n6. He must notify the landlord 3 days before he moves out, leave<br />\nthe dwelling clean and return the keys 24 hours after leaving.<br />\nIf the tenant thinks there is a violation in his house that should be<br />\ncorrected, he can report it directly to the Department of Housing<br />\nand Community Development(HCD)in Baltimore.<br />\nVI. RENT ESCROW LAW<br />\nWhen a landlord refuses to repair a condition which constitutes or<br />\nwill constitute a serious threat to the life, health or safety of the<br />\ntenant or which constitutes a fire hazard, the tenant has the right to<br />\ninitiate actions against the landlord's failure to repair dangerous<br />\nconditions.<br />\nFor example:<br />\nI. Lack of hot or cold running water.<br />\n2. Lack of heat, light or electricity.<br />\n3. Lack of adequate sewage facilities.<br />\n4. Presence of rats or mice.<br />\n5. Presence of lead paint.<br />\nThe tenant may take an affirmative procedure. To this he must:<br />\n1. Send a certified letter to the landlord describing the defective<br />\ncondition (so the tenant will have a \"Return receipt\"; also you<br />\nshould retain a copy of the letter).<br />\n2. The landlord must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to<br />\nmake repairs(not in excess of 30 days).<br />\n3. If the landlord fails to make the repairs, the tenant can then<br />\nfile an action and withhold rent from the landlord while paying the<br />\nmoney into a court account.<br />\n4. A hearing will follow leaving the landlord an opportunity to<br />\nreply to the action.<br />\n5. If the repairs are found to be necessary, the tenant will then<br />\npay his rent to Escrow account. The Rent Escrow law authorizes<br />\nthat the account may be paid out for the specific purpose of making<br />\nbadly needed repairs.<br />\na) In the judgment of the court, either the landlord or the tenant<br />\nmay utilize the withheld money to make necessary repairs.<br />\nb) If no repairs are made 6 months later, the money in the account is returned to the tenant, or rent may be abated by an<br />\namount determined by the court to equitably represent the conditions found to exist.<br />\nIf the lease term is one year or less, an alternative to the affirmative action procedure is:<br />\nI. The tenant sends a certified letter to the landlord (keeping the<br />\nreciept and a copy of the letter).<br />\n2. If the landlord fails to make the repairs within 30 days the<br />\ntenant stops paying rent but the tenant keeps the rent money to pay<br />\nto the court w.hen required.<br />\n3. The tenant will receive a summons to appear in rent court as<br />\nthe landlord will seek to<br />\nevict, you for nonpayment of rent. In court<br />\nthe tenant presents the<br />\ncourt with a copy of the<br />\nletter sent to the landlord, the receipt and all<br />\nthe rent money he has<br />\nwithheld.<br />\n4. If the court finds<br />\nthe Rent Escrow Law applies, the procedure will<br />\nbe as in the positive affirmative action.<br />\nVII. EVICTION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT<br />\nIf a tenant receives a notice from the court to appear for \"summary ejectment\" proceedings, he must attend, but seek advice first.<br />\nEVICTIONS CAN BE VERY SPEEDY. What the landlord will have<br />\ndone is:<br />\nI. Landlord may request a written complaint for back rent due.<br />\nHe may request this as soon as a rent due date- has passed and the<br />\ntenant has failed to pay the rent.<br />\n2. The tenant will receive notice to appear in first class mail<br />\nscheduled 5 court days after the landlord's complaint was filed.<br />\n3. If the landlord wins the case, the tenant will be ordered to<br />\nleave the dwelling within 2 days unless he pays the back rent before<br />\nthat time.<br />\n4. The tenant has to leave. Ply the rent, or he has the rich t of<br />\nappeal.<br /><br />\nEviction for Reasons Oilier Than Non-Payment of Rent:<br />\nI. In cases of tenancies fro year to year, the landlord must give the<br />\ntenant 90 days' notice before the end of the year in order to terminate the tenancy.<br />\n2. For tenancies of any other lengths, including month to month<br />\nthe landlord can give the tenant a 60 day NOTICE TO QUIT (notice<br />\nto move out) for any of the following reasons or without giving any<br />\nreason at all:<br />\na) He wants the dwelling for himself.<br />\nb) The dwelling requires substantial remodeling.<br />\nc) The dwelling is being converted to non-housing use.<br />\n3. The landlord must give a 30 day NOT TO QUIT for any of the<br />\nfollowing reasons (he must give a reason):<br />\na) The tenant has denied the landlord reasonable entry to the<br />\napartment.<br />\nb) The dwelling is being used for illegal or immoral purposes.<br />\nc) The lease has expired and the \"principal tenant\" no longer<br />\noccupies the dwelling and the present occupants are sub-tenants.<br />\nVIII.

Not only has the Honor Code been revised, but<br />\nthe previously murky area of student conduct has begun to<br />\nbe clarified. The Honor Code was something of a farce it<br />\nseemed, since some professors ignored its demands upon<br />\nthem and some students cheated iii spite of it. Maybe the<br />\nnew one will work; we'll find out next semester.<br />\nAs far as the question of non-academic conduct goes,<br />\nthere are in any community questions of pilferage, of inflicted injuries and of interference with the rights of others.<br />\nMany communities spend a long time struggling over such<br />\nquestions and many never come up with a satisfactory answer.<br />\nHopkins is trying to remedy that situation with its current consideration of a two-part student conduct and procedure code. The Conduct code is to define whaticonstitutes a violation of University rules and the rights of others<br />\nand the procederural code is to define a means of establishing whether any violation occurred. But the essential problem with such a code is the fact that Hopkins is a private<br />\nuniversity, and as such, the ultimate power in it rests with<br />\nthe President and the Board of Trustees. They may delegate<br />\nwhat powers they see fit to the appropriate officers of the<br />\nUniversity, but they are ultimately responsible for what the<br />\ninstitution does. Thus, any discussion of a review process<br />\nfor complaints about student conduct becomes a little specious. If the University were ever threatened by a serious<br />\nmatter of a student's conduct, such as might occur during a<br />\nstrike, the responsible authorities might act to insure that<br />\nno decision on that student's conduct is made which jeopardizes the institution. On that basis alone, any discipline<br />\ncode suffers from a certain lack of credibility.<br /><br />\n3400<br /><br />\non<br />\nStage<br />\nphoto essay<br />\nby<br />\nrobert baum,<br />\nbrian blitz,<br />\njohn hynan,<br />\njeff mc erlean<br />\nand<br />\njeff posner<br />\ntext by b. h. cohen<br />\n3400 on Stage, the second<br />\nannual Hopkins spring fair,<br />\nmelange of springtime revelry,<br />\namusement park depravity, and<br />\nschoolday charm, faded into night<br />\nlate Sunday evening, as the Smith<br />\nStreet Society, musicians after a<br /><br />\nPresident Savitz at the bat, Garland Hall dwarfed in his magnitude.<br />\nfashion, gave way on the Gilman<br />\nQuadrangle to a half-hour sizzling<br />\nfireworks display. Admittedly,<br />\n10:30 p.m. was a little late to<br />\nbegin; and yes, the sound was so<br />\ndeafening that switchboards here<br />\nand at police stations(nearby were<br />\njammed with irate and even<br />\ncurious callers. Their children had<br />\nbeen awakened; their dogs would<br />\nnot hush; they thought perhaps the<br />\nchemistry building had blown up.<br /><br />\nYou could hear the sound clear out<br />\ninto Reisterstown. The next<br />\nmorning, offices here were flooded<br />\nwith calls. When someone down in<br />\nCity Hall suggested that Hopkins<br />\nhad not bothered to get a license,<br />\nSC President Andy Savitz hauled<br />\nass downtown, license in hand.<br />\nIt was one of those things. After<br />\nit was all over, co-chairman Eric<br />\nRasmussen, looking somewhat<br />\nsleepless, placidly said he'd never<br />\nrun a fair again.<br />\nAnd George S.
