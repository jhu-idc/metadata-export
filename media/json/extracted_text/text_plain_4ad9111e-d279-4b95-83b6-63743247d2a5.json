H. U., 4.<br />\nU. OF P., 1.<br />\nBlack and Blue opened her inter-colHE<br />\nlegiate lacrosse season on last Saturday<br />\nafternoon when she defeated the University of<br />\nPennsylvania team at the new athletic grounds<br />\non the York Road by a score of 4 to 1. This<br />\nis the second consecutive time that the wearers<br />\nof the Red and Blue have suffered defeat at<br />\nthe hands of our team, and by so doing have<br />\nvery auspiciously opened the present season.<br />\nThe result of the game showed much to both<br />\nsides. Pennsylvania succeeded in scoring a<br />\ngoal and in holding down her opponents to a<br />\nsmall score. While our boys showed that<br />\nthey had in there numbers men who will<br />\nbecome worthy successors to Maddren, McInness, Foster, Grimes, Guggenheimer, and<br />\nothers whose names are still dear to every<br />\nloyal Hopkins man. To be sure the men were<br />\nstill raw owing to the number of new men,<br />\nbut even in the little time which had elapsed<br />\nsince the All-Baltimore game, a decided improvement could be noticed. The University<br />\nof Pennsylvania team showed a decided improvement over last year's form, notwithstanding the loss of such men as Cross, Thomas,<br />\nand Van Valkenberg. Brommell, ex-captain<br />\nof the Swarthmore team, and Orton, Pennsy's<br />\nfamous miler, have been acting as coaches,<br />\nand the result of their work was quite apparent<br />\nespecially in their team work.<br />\nWhen .the game was called a fair crowd<br />\noccupied the grandstand and yelled encouragement to their favorites. In the first<br />\nhalf the ball hovered for some minutes dangerously near the Hopkins goal, but soon \"Aber\"<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nNo. 13<br />\n<br />\nsecured it and hurried it up the field to the<br />\nattack. Clever work by Hatch and Palmer<br />\nBernheim soon advanced it to the elder Bernheim who missed the play, and Penn. again got<br />\nthe ball, but soon it was back again in Pennsie's territory and Putts made an attempt for<br />\na goal, but failed. After two more failures<br />\nBernheim was able to put it in the net, and<br />\nmade the first point for Hopkins. When the<br />\nball was again in play it was secured by<br />\nEbaugh, who shot high for a try at goal.<br />\nRanft only partially stopped it and the ball<br />\nrolled into the net just before the referee's<br />\nwhistle sounded for the end of the first half.<br />\nIn the second half our boys took a big brace,<br />\nand three goals by Putts were the result before<br />\nthe half was over. Putts is a new man and<br />\nwill find it hard work to fill his position as his<br />\npredecessor, McInness, did, but on Saturday,<br />\nsteadied by the older men on the attack, Bernheim and Bandel, he displayed considerable<br />\nability in the way he covered his territory.<br />\nHatch and Bernheim, also new men on the<br />\nattack, showed splendid form and a thorough<br />\nknowledge of the game. Ranft, the new goal<br />\nkeeper, still lacks experience, but was unusually good for a new tender. He turned aside<br />\nseveral\"hot\" shots, but was unfortunate in<br />\nhaving one drop from his stick and roll into<br />\nthe net after he had partially stopped it.<br />\n\"Bill\" Schmeiser, one of the old men, played in his usual way. He alone cut off several<br />\nexcellent shots that were going straight for<br />\nthe goal by simply jumping in the way, and<br />\nwas able to surprise the newer men by his<br />\ncoolness. Tyler at cover point captained his<br />\nteam and took everything that came his way.<br />\nBruton played in the same old energetic way<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE \u2022NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nand the two freshmen, Tough and Earnest<br />\nSchmeiser, did most creditable work on the<br />\ndefense. Abercrombie was always at the<br />\nright place at the right time, and caused much<br />\nmerriment for the spectators in the way he<br />\ndodged his opponent.<br />\nAs a team the defense put up much the<br />\nstronger game, but the attack did well and no<br />\ndoubt will improve when they have played together longer.<br />\nThe way the teams lined up is as follows:<br />\n<br />\nthat Dr. Gilman's kindness was appreciated<br />\nby us all too.<br />\nWishing you all success for the season, I am<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nApril 15t11.<br />\nCORNELIOUS D.

Captain \"Pete\" Moore and Manager<br />\nFrank Neer are giving their undivided attention to the necessary arrangements, and thus<br />\nfar the encouragingly large squad of candidates<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nhas been very prompt in showing up for<br />\npractice.<br />\nThe revival of interest in the national sport<br />\nat Hopkins has been due in a large measure to<br />\nthe efforts of Manager Neer. For several<br />\nweeks past he has endeavered to inform himself with regard to the material at the University and the spirit of those interested in the<br />\nsport. The investigation ended in having a<br />\nmeeting, on April 5, of the old players, at which<br />\nit was decided that an attempt should be made<br />\nto start the movement. Accordingly, practice<br />\nwas held on the following day at American<br />\nLeague Park; it resulted favorably, and upon<br />\nseveral occasions during the past week over a<br />\ndozen candidates have turned out. Among<br />\nthe men who intend to try for positions are<br />\nCarr, formerly second-baseman on the University of North Carolina; Baker, who used to<br />\npitch for Western Maryland College; Neer, of<br />\nthe Rock Hill College team; \"Pete\" Moore,<br />\nAtkinson, Humphreys, Campbell, Constantine,<br />\nBlanck, E Strouse, Hand, Naigel, Moorse,<br />\nAdelsdorf, Duck, Lupton, Marine, Boyer,<br />\nGutman, Yearley, Frazier, Stubbs, and Smith,<br />\nof the Medical School. This list should<br />\ncertainly prove encouraging to the promoters<br />\nof the project. Among the number are almost<br />\nall the old players, and several new ones who<br />\nhave made very favorable impressions on Captain Moore. Coaching by such men as McGraw<br />\nand Robinson will be of great benefit to<br />\nthe candidates. President Reese of the Athletic Association and Physical Director Mackdemott have promised to aid the movement in<br />\nevery way possible. Encouraged by the success attained, therefore, Manager Neer has<br />\nopened communication with a number of<br />\ncolleges. Among them are Lehigh, Georgetown, Rutgers, Gallaudet, and Rock Hill. He<br />\nalso hopes to enter a Hopkins' nine in the<br />\nInter-Collegiate League against St. John's and<br />\nWestern Maryland. Who knows but what<br />\nanother pennant may be hung to the trophy<br />\nroom before the football season. Let us hope<br />\nso; but at the same time, let every man who<br />\nknows what a baseball is come out and try for<br />\na position.

One of the papers circulated<br />\nthe report that the entire sum had been raised,<br />\nwhich statement brought forth a strong denial<br />\non the part of the Trustees of the University.<br />\nAs a matter of fact the million has by no<br />\nmeans been raised; as yet only about half having been subscribed. As soon as the total<br />\namount is reached the announcement will be<br />\nmade, and until then there is nothing to do<br />\nbut patiently wait.<br />\n<br />\nw<br />\n<br />\nstriking example of \"truth crushed to<br />\nearth\" has been afforded the scholastic<br />\nworld by the summary dismissal of two of<br />\nLeland Stanford University's most brilliant<br />\nprofessors, because in a free country, enjoying<br />\nthe rights of free press and free speech, these<br />\ngentlemen dared to express their opinions regarding certain economic questions of vital<br />\nimportance.<br />\nWhen Dr. Ross, professor in economics,<br />\npointed out the pernicious influence of under-<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\npaid Chinese labor being brought into competition with American workmen, he was informed that his services at Leland Stanford could<br />\nbe dispensed with, for she who controlled the<br />\nUniversity finances employs Chinese labor.<br />\nA few weeks later, Dr. Howard, in tracing<br />\nthe causes leading up to the French Revolution, discovered some startling comparisons<br />\nbetween the methods of the degenerate French<br />\naristocracy and those employed by American<br />\ncapitalists and capitalistic corporations. He<br />\nemphasized the necessity of public ownership<br />\nof natural monopolies, and declared himself<br />\npositively in favor of municipal ownership of<br />\nstreet railways, etc. He showed that little<br />\ndifference existed between the \"fiade defamine\"<br />\nor famous grain ring of Louis XV, and similar combinations of the present time. In conclusion he said, \"I have a negative as well as<br />\na positive creed. I do not worship Saint Market Street; I do not reverence holy Standard<br />\nOil, nor do I doff my cap to the Celestial Six<br />\nCompanies.\"<br />\nThese utterances caused some consternation<br />\nin the city of the \"Golden Gate.\" A delegation of injured capitalists representing the<br />\ninterests of the Market Street Railway Co.<br />\nsought an audience with Mrs. Stanford. A<br />\ncouncil of war was held, and it was decided<br />\nthat such expressions were seditious, and, if<br />\nnot curbed, would exert an unholy influence<br />\nupon the youth of the land, thereby causing it<br />\nto form profane ideas regarding the sacred character of our holy American corporations. Dr.<br />\nHoward was summoned before the high tribunal, and told to recant or go into exile, while<br />\nat the same time the fate of Dr. Ross was pictured to him in startling colors. Dr. Howard<br />\nreplied that the duty of the scholar was to investigate scientifically, and speak the truth<br />\nboldly, as the guarantee of American Democracy lay in the intrepid scholar. This heretical<br />\ndoctrine sealed his fate, and he was forthwith<br />\ndismissed. In Germany, the home of higher<br />\ncriticism, and advanced economic thought, even<br />\nthough the Universities are supported by the<br />\ngovernment, restrictions upon free thought are<br />\nnot imposed.

In the first place, the words \"the<br />\nides do march\" are entirely incorrect, and<br />\nwere never written by Brutus, as has been<br />\nproven by an energetic Junior of the Shakspeare class. It was discovered last month<br />\nduring Exams, that the sentence should have<br />\nread \"the ideas do march,\" according to which<br />\nWillie intended to convey the meaning that<br />\nsometimes during Exams, ideas do pass quickly<br />\nthrough the brain of the lad sitting in torture<br />\nand watching the minute hand of the clock<br />\nmove, with all the bravery of a Cxsar.

H. U., 4.<br />\nU. OF P., 1.<br />\nBlack and Blue opened her inter-colHE<br />\nlegiate lacrosse season on last Saturday<br />\nafternoon when she defeated the University of<br />\nPennsylvania team at the new athletic grounds<br />\non the York Road by a score of 4 to 1. This<br />\nis the second consecutive time that the wearers<br />\nof the Red and Blue have suffered defeat at<br />\nthe hands of our team, and by so doing have<br />\nvery auspiciously opened the present season.<br />\nThe result of the game showed much to both<br />\nsides. Pennsylvania succeeded in scoring a<br />\ngoal and in holding down her opponents to a<br />\nsmall score. While our boys showed that<br />\nthey had in there numbers men who will<br />\nbecome worthy successors to Maddren, McInness, Foster, Grimes, Guggenheimer, and<br />\nothers whose names are still dear to every<br />\nloyal Hopkins man. To be sure the men were<br />\nstill raw owing to the number of new men,<br />\nbut even in the little time which had elapsed<br />\nsince the All-Baltimore game, a decided improvement could be noticed. The University<br />\nof Pennsylvania team showed a decided improvement over last year's form, notwithstanding the loss of such men as Cross, Thomas,<br />\nand Van Valkenberg. Brommell, ex-captain<br />\nof the Swarthmore team, and Orton, Pennsy's<br />\nfamous miler, have been acting as coaches,<br />\nand the result of their work was quite apparent<br />\nespecially in their team work.<br />\nWhen .the game was called a fair crowd<br />\noccupied the grandstand and yelled encouragement to their favorites. In the first<br />\nhalf the ball hovered for some minutes dangerously near the Hopkins goal, but soon \"Aber\"<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nNo. 13<br /><br />\nsecured it and hurried it up the field to the<br />\nattack. Clever work by Hatch and Palmer<br />\nBernheim soon advanced it to the elder Bernheim who missed the play, and Penn. again got<br />\nthe ball, but soon it was back again in Pennsie's territory and Putts made an attempt for<br />\na goal, but failed. After two more failures<br />\nBernheim was able to put it in the net, and<br />\nmade the first point for Hopkins. When the<br />\nball was again in play it was secured by<br />\nEbaugh, who shot high for a try at goal.<br />\nRanft only partially stopped it and the ball<br />\nrolled into the net just before the referee's<br />\nwhistle sounded for the end of the first half.<br />\nIn the second half our boys took a big brace,<br />\nand three goals by Putts were the result before<br />\nthe half was over. Putts is a new man and<br />\nwill find it hard work to fill his position as his<br />\npredecessor, McInness, did, but on Saturday,<br />\nsteadied by the older men on the attack, Bernheim and Bandel, he displayed considerable<br />\nability in the way he covered his territory.<br />\nHatch and Bernheim, also new men on the<br />\nattack, showed splendid form and a thorough<br />\nknowledge of the game. Ranft, the new goal<br />\nkeeper, still lacks experience, but was unusually good for a new tender. He turned aside<br />\nseveral\"hot\" shots, but was unfortunate in<br />\nhaving one drop from his stick and roll into<br />\nthe net after he had partially stopped it.<br />\n\"Bill\" Schmeiser, one of the old men, played in his usual way. He alone cut off several<br />\nexcellent shots that were going straight for<br />\nthe goal by simply jumping in the way, and<br />\nwas able to surprise the newer men by his<br />\ncoolness. Tyler at cover point captained his<br />\nteam and took everything that came his way.<br />\nBruton played in the same old energetic way<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE \u2022NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nand the two freshmen, Tough and Earnest<br />\nSchmeiser, did most creditable work on the<br />\ndefense.

Captain \"Pete\" Moore and Manager<br />\nFrank Neer are giving their undivided attention to the necessary arrangements, and thus<br />\nfar the encouragingly large squad of candidates<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nhas been very prompt in showing up for<br />\npractice.<br />\nThe revival of interest in the national sport<br />\nat Hopkins has been due in a large measure to<br />\nthe efforts of Manager Neer. For several<br />\nweeks past he has endeavered to inform himself with regard to the material at the University and the spirit of those interested in the<br />\nsport. The investigation ended in having a<br />\nmeeting, on April 5, of the old players, at which<br />\nit was decided that an attempt should be made<br />\nto start the movement. Accordingly, practice<br />\nwas held on the following day at American<br />\nLeague Park; it resulted favorably, and upon<br />\nseveral occasions during the past week over a<br />\ndozen candidates have turned out. Among<br />\nthe men who intend to try for positions are<br />\nCarr, formerly second-baseman on the University of North Carolina; Baker, who used to<br />\npitch for Western Maryland College; Neer, of<br />\nthe Rock Hill College team; \"Pete\" Moore,<br />\nAtkinson, Humphreys, Campbell, Constantine,<br />\nBlanck, E Strouse, Hand, Naigel, Moorse,<br />\nAdelsdorf, Duck, Lupton, Marine, Boyer,<br />\nGutman, Yearley, Frazier, Stubbs, and Smith,<br />\nof the Medical School. This list should<br />\ncertainly prove encouraging to the promoters<br />\nof the project. Among the number are almost<br />\nall the old players, and several new ones who<br />\nhave made very favorable impressions on Captain Moore. Coaching by such men as McGraw<br />\nand Robinson will be of great benefit to<br />\nthe candidates. President Reese of the Athletic Association and Physical Director Mackdemott have promised to aid the movement in<br />\nevery way possible. Encouraged by the success attained, therefore, Manager Neer has<br />\nopened communication with a number of<br />\ncolleges. Among them are Lehigh, Georgetown, Rutgers, Gallaudet, and Rock Hill. He<br />\nalso hopes to enter a Hopkins' nine in the<br />\nInter-Collegiate League against St. John's and<br />\nWestern Maryland. Who knows but what<br />\nanother pennant may be hung to the trophy<br />\nroom before the football season. Let us hope<br />\nso; but at the same time, let every man who<br />\nknows what a baseball is come out and try for<br />\na position.

He<br />\nemphasized the necessity of public ownership<br />\nof natural monopolies, and declared himself<br />\npositively in favor of municipal ownership of<br />\nstreet railways, etc. He showed that little<br />\ndifference existed between the \"fiade defamine\"<br />\nor famous grain ring of Louis XV, and similar combinations of the present time. In conclusion he said, \"I have a negative as well as<br />\na positive creed. I do not worship Saint Market Street; I do not reverence holy Standard<br />\nOil, nor do I doff my cap to the Celestial Six<br />\nCompanies.\"<br />\nThese utterances caused some consternation<br />\nin the city of the \"Golden Gate.\" A delegation of injured capitalists representing the<br />\ninterests of the Market Street Railway Co.<br />\nsought an audience with Mrs. Stanford. A<br />\ncouncil of war was held, and it was decided<br />\nthat such expressions were seditious, and, if<br />\nnot curbed, would exert an unholy influence<br />\nupon the youth of the land, thereby causing it<br />\nto form profane ideas regarding the sacred character of our holy American corporations. Dr.<br />\nHoward was summoned before the high tribunal, and told to recant or go into exile, while<br />\nat the same time the fate of Dr. Ross was pictured to him in startling colors. Dr. Howard<br />\nreplied that the duty of the scholar was to investigate scientifically, and speak the truth<br />\nboldly, as the guarantee of American Democracy lay in the intrepid scholar. This heretical<br />\ndoctrine sealed his fate, and he was forthwith<br />\ndismissed.

A., on the period from 1816 to<br />\n1835, \"teaching upon the reorganization of<br />\nthe commercial policy, the protest of the minority, and the nullification movement as a<br />\ntest of the Union \u2014 its origin, nature, and significance.\"<br /><br />\nD<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nINQUIRY COLUMN.<br />\n(In this column the NEWS-LETTER will answer, to the best of<br />\nits ability, the queries forwarded by correspondents.)<br /><br />\nMr. Editor: I recently had a discussion<br />\nwith a literary friend in regard to the place in<br />\nthe works of Julius Shakspeare where the following quotation occurs: \"Beware! the Ides<br />\ndo march !\" My friend persisted that Omlet<br />\nsaid this to MacDuffy in the third inning of<br />\nTwelve Nights of Midsummer Madness, but I<br />\nam sure it was published in the Baltimore Sun<br />\nduring the last presidential campaign. Can<br />\nyou set us right?\u2014Critic.<br />\nThe settlement of the point under discussion requires a thorough knowledge of Textual or Lower criticism, and the editors feel<br />\nparticularly fitted just now to decide, having<br />\njust passed through a course of English Literature. In the first place, the words \"the<br />\nides do march\" are entirely incorrect, and<br />\nwere never written by Brutus, as has been<br />\nproven by an energetic Junior of the Shakspeare class. It was discovered last month<br />\nduring Exams, that the sentence should have<br />\nread \"the ideas do march,\" according to which<br />\nWillie intended to convey the meaning that<br />\nsometimes during Exams, ideas do pass quickly<br />\nthrough the brain of the lad sitting in torture<br />\nand watching the minute hand of the clock<br />\nmove, with all the bravery of a Cxsar. We<br />\nthought we were familiar with Shakspeare's<br />\nDivine Novels, but a thorough perusal of the<br />\nnew annotated edition of the Diamond Dick<br />\nLibrary fails to reveal the character referred<br />\nto. Under the new interpretation the question regarding our most worthy contemporary<br />\nthe Sun answers itself.<br />\nMr. Editor: As a stranger to this city, I<br />\nshould like to know whether the new Court<br />\nHouse or the City College is the most magnificent building in Baltimore. Would you<br />\nkindly give a short description of each?<br />\n\u2014New York.<br />\nThere can be absolutely no comparison<br />\nbetween the two buildings mentioned. The<br />\nCourt House is built for occupancy by greyheaded upholders of the law. We are sorry<br />\nto state that we know very little of the City<br />\nCollege, but are under the impression that its<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nchief characteristic and greatest claim to fame<br />\nlies in the fact that it is situated next to a<br />\ngreat educational center.<br />\nMr. Editor: Can you give me in one word<br />\nthe main element of Spenser's poetry?<br />\n\u2014English Student.<br />\nInsomniaantidote.<br />\nV.=S.<br /><br />\nATHLETIC NOTES.<br />\nByrne has received a telegram<br />\nMANAGER<br />\nfrom Manager Metcalf of the Harvard<br />\nLacrosse Team stating that they will play the<br />\nHopkins Team in Baltimore on May the sixth<br />\ninstead of the second as formerly announced.<br />\nThis is the only change which has been made<br />\nin the schedule as announced in the NEwsLETTER several weeks ago.<br />\nw w<br />\nDirector Mackdermott, Captain Hoffmann<br />\nand Manager Pearre have about decided on the<br />\nfollowing entries for the Princeton handicap<br />\ngames which take place on April the 20.<br />\nRobert Garrett\u2014shot\u2014put running high<br />\njumps, and rnnning broad jumps.

The examinations are over, and<br />\nafter working very hard I succeeded in passing<br />\nall of them, and making a very good impression<br />\nupon the professors, especially Dr. Green, the<br />\nprofessor in Rhetoric. I have lost my report<br />\nbut will send it to you as soon as I can find it.<br />\nI stayed in town because our vacation was very<br />\nshort, and was invited to a friend's to spend<br />\nEaster with him. My expenses are pretty<br />\nheavy as I have joined Y. M. C.

I will send<br />\nyou an account of all my expenses in my next<br />\nletter.<br /><br />\n[2.]<br />\nDEAR FRED,\u2014I tell you college life is great<br />\nonly it's expensive. The night before examinations I went out with some fellows and<br />\nspoiled a suit of clothes, and it takes all my<br />\nknowledge of arithmetic to make up an<br />\nexpense account once a month. \"Figures<br />\nnever lie.\" The profs. down here don't give<br />\nfair examinations, and I think they show<br />\npartiality, because they flunked me in every<br />\nsubject except drawing and public speaking,<br />\nand I had to stay in town during vacation and<br />\ntake two exams, over again. When you<br />\nflunk here they won't let you play on athletic<br />\nteams or go on musical club trips, and if it<br />\nwasn't for that I think I could do good work<br />\non both. If you get through school this year<br />\nyou better come to Hopkins next year; its lots<br />\nof fun down here. If I get a check from the<br />\nfolks tomorrow I'm going out and have some<br />\nfun tomorrow night, hut I'm broke now and<br />\nI've borrowed six dollars and twenty-five cents<br />\nYours,<br />\nfrom my room-mate.<br /><br />\nCHARLIE.<br /><br />\nP.

First a number of Freshmen were fascinated by the charms of infantile measles, now<br />\nit appears that an epidemic of that horrible<br />\ndisease, that desire to bind oneself to somebody<br />\nelse which is so killing, has struck the place<br />\nwith a full blast. Not satisfied with carrying<br />\naway our chief rooter, and striking dismay into<br />\nthe halls of W. C. B. and G. L. S. it has<br />\ncaught in its whirl a member of the Junk);<br />\nClass who announces that he is going to marry.<br />\nJust let your thoughts rest for a moment on<br />\nthat awe-inspiring announcement,\u2014a Junior<br />\ngoing to marry. The first idea that struck<br />\nour minds was children must not play with<br />\nfire. We can easily conceive how the elderly,<br />\nserious seniors (e. g. the chief rooter) whose<br />\nthoughts are always elevated towards higher,<br />\nnobler fields where they can roam about enjoying nectarine happiness, are willing to drop all<br />\nearthly cares for the heavenly bliss of domesticity; but how Juniors, sordid, animal creatures, can possibly attain to such heights is<br />\nentirely beyond our comprehension. The<br />\nsenior at 2 years of age is perfectly prepared<br />\nto turn from the heavy duties of college<br />\nroutine and its noon-day lunches to a lighter,<br />\nmore airy sphere; a senior can do this, but we<br />\nserionsly fear that a grave danger confronts all<br />\nJuniors who attempt such a thing.<br />\nSome means must be taken to stop the danger,\u2014a stringent barrier placed before the<br />\ndangerous monster that to be loved needs but<br />\nto be seen, or some law proposed that will<br />\nsucceed in attaining the object. We are aware<br />\nthat there is a law against a minor procuring<br />\na marriage license; there is, however, also a<br />\nlaw to procure one. The latter law we believe,<br />\ncame into existence in 188o ; it threatens to go<br />\nout now. Most Juniors, we venture to say, are<br />\nnot of age, and are therefore subject to prohibitory laws against matrimony. It is doubtful to our mind if a minor can be married with<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nthe law on his side; yes, the question is can he?<br />\nIt all events we simply wish to point out<br />\nthe dangers of such occurrences, it is not our<br />\nduty to stop them.
