The Blue Ribbon Panel on Undergraduate<br />\nEducation considered the matter and decided to<br />\ninclude it in their list of recommendations.

New input on teacher criteria by<br />\nundergraduates is not only necessary but will also be<br />\nwell received by the Academic Council.

Under<br />\nthe amiable but aimless direction of<br />\nHoward Mitchelo, the Symphony, playing<br />\nat the cavernous and usually half-empty<br />\nDAR Constituiton Hall, was considered<br />\nmediocre at best, an opinion underscored<br />\nby the frequent and always sole-out<br />\nappearances of other orchestras, such as<br />\nthose of Philadelphia, London, and<br />\nVienna.<br />\n<br />\nBut Washingtonians needn't laugh nay<br />\nmore. In the last several years, the<br />\nfortunes of the National Symphony have<br />\ntaken a sudden and dramatic turn for the<br />\nbetter. Performances are now given at the<br />\nConcert Hall of the new Kennedy Center<br />\nfor the Performing Arts, an auditorium<br />\nwhich is acoustically magnificent, if not<br />\narchitecturally so, and are for the most<br />\npart very well attended.

I<br />\nhave no intention of saying students can't<br />\ntake courses elsewhere.<br />\nOne thing we'd like to do is to open up<br />\nthe Evening College. ...There's<br />\nmisdirection in the current operating<br />\nrules, because part of the form day school<br />\npeople fill out requires them to justify<br />\ntheir taking an Evening College course.<br />\nMy view is about 180 degrees from that<br />\nstatement of justification. The Evening<br />\nCollege should be used to diversify the<br />\nundergraduate program. ...I would expect<br />\nthat if a course is offered in the Natural<br />\nSciences, for example, in the day school<br />\nthat's required for someone majoring in<br />\nthat area, the student would take it in the<br />\nday school. But if a student wants to take<br />\na course in the Evening College that's not<br />\nin his major, that should be fine, although<br />\nI would think that some limit would be<br />\nput on the total number of credits<br />\ncoming from the Evening College that<br />\ncould be used towards graduation.<br />\nBut do you think that the existing<br />\ncredit system should be continued? I<br />\nthink a lot of people are dissatisfied with<br />\nit. Let rne quote Dr. Laurence Holland<br />\nfrom a March 1972 News-Letter:<br />\n\"There's less chance at Hopkins for an<br />\nundergrad to explore his full range of<br />\ninterests. Attention is fragmented. A<br />\nstudent can't work as intensively on any<br />\none course or independent study project<br />\nas at places where the course load ism<br />\nmore concentrated (i.e. in fewer<br />\ncourses).\"<br />\nIf I could devise a system which would<br />\nwork, I would put us on a subject basis<br />\nand get us off credits and numbers. There<br />\nare smaller schools, such as<br />\nManhantanville, which don't have a credit<br />\nsystem and instead judge students by<br />\ncuriculum content and with frequent<br />\nfaculty evaluations. ...But we can't mold<br />\nourselves in their image any more than<br />\nthey (smaller schools)can do all what we<br />\ncan do right now. We can certainly<br />\nde-emphasize credits, and I think the<br />\nfaculty would be delighted with that.<br />\nWhy?<br />\nBecause the credit system ties them to<br />\nnumbers. It's a system of currency.<br />\nDollars become credits. A lot of<br />\nbargaining goes on. People shop around<br />\nfor courses, and this occurrs often enough<br />\nto give the feeling of a marketplace....<br />\nBut don't you think this is the fault of<br />\n<br />\nI iii not all<br />\n<br />\nraising graduation<br />\n<br />\nrequirements to 130 credits, if that's<br />\nwhat you mean. ...Decisions are going to<br />\nbe made before spring advising, because<br />\nthe decisions will have a bearing on<br />\nstudents' academic plans for the summer<br />\nand next fall. But I can't picture making a<br />\nmajor revision of credit requirements or<br />\ndegree requirements.<br />\nOne thing I will say is that before you<br />\nknock the credit system, you should talk<br />\nto some of the students I think many of<br />\nthem like the present system. They like<br />\nthe it because it gives them a target,<br />\nsomething predictable. There's less doubt<br />\nin their minds for when requirements for<br />\na degree can be met, and the<br />\nprogramming of courses is simpler. I m<br />\nnot sure you would find objections to the<br />\ncredit system so strong among students.<br />\nBut we agree that the system isn't all<br />\nthat it could be, that there are valid<br />\nobjections to it. What changes do you<br />\nthink are possible?<br />\nI could see ways to make the credit<br />\nsystem more flexible. Let's say you<br />\nrequire a student, going into any field, to<br />\ntake 96 credits in that field -the<br />\neducational core\u2014and then set another<br />\nnumber for filling in that would be wide<br />\nopen for the student. The core area<br />\nwould need to be defined with some care.<br />\nw=.-a t the constraints and what the<br />\nexposure should be. There would be no<br />\nmore battles of points, and it would leave<br />\nthe student free to do as he or she would<br />\nlike.<br />\nAnother topic which has come up<br />\nrecently is that of early graduation. How<br />\nmany people have graduated early this<br />\nyear, and is this number larger than it has<br />\nbeen in the past?<br />\nThe trend is that the number is<br />\nincreasing significantly. Without having<br />\nseen any specific figures\u2014I'm just dealing<br />\nin round numbers right now\u2014I would say<br />\nthat at least double the number who<br />\ngraduated early last year will do so this<br />\nyear. Again, this is coupled to having to<br />\nhave 120 credits. There's been a<br />\nnoticeable shift from 10 or 15 years ago<br />\nwhen programs exceeding 120 credits was<br />\nthe rule. More and more people now aim<br />\nfor only the mininium, and I get requests<br />\nfrom people who want to graduate with<br />\n117. It calls into question the whole<br />\nprocess of putting numbers on courses.<br />\nThe number of students who are going<br />\ntowards an early graduation<br />\nquite<br />\nlegitimately, which I want to stress, is<br />\ngoing to increase as long as the financial<br />\nsituation remains as it is....<br />\nIf the undergraduate school could<br />\ndevelop some method for eliminating<br />\ntuition (this is pie in the sky I'm talking<br />\nabout), I would wager that this whole<br />\nissue (of early graduation) would<br />\n<br />\nThe fifty-five works on exhibit in the<br />\n<br />\ngallery at the Eisenhower Library,<br />\nthrough March 2, are representative of a<br />\nvariety of meduims, running the gamut of<br />\nwater colors, oils, collages, etchings, and<br />\npen and ink.

Of all the Blue Jays who<br />\nsaw more than limited action,<br />\nonly John Rutter, Al Robinson,<br />\nand Paul Spence appeared to<br />\nhustle throughout. The remaining<br />\nmembers seemed convinced that<br />\nthe game was nothing more than<br />\na scrimmage; as a result, the<br />\nhighly partisan crowd, not known<br />\nfor their love of referees, booed<br />\ntheir own team more than the<br />\nofficials.<br />\nThe story of the game could<br />\nGreg Delong meets the opposition. not be told by the shooting<br />\npercentages. The visiting<br />\n<br />\nNWS-LETFER<br />\n<br />\nGreyhounds canned 34 of 77<br />\nfrom the field, or 44.1%. JHU<br />\nmade 33 of 75 shots, or 44%.<br />\nFrom the free throw line, Loyola<br />\ntallied on 26 of 35 for 74% while<br />\ntheir hosts hit 24 or 30 for 80%.<br />\nThe difference in this contest<br />\nwas under the backboards.<br />\nLoyola grabbed 54 caroms while<br />\nthe Jays had only 39. Many of<br />\nthe \"Hounds\" rebounds were on<br />\noffense, allowing them two or<br />\nmore shots at the basket. On<br />\nthese occasions, the Hopkins<br />\nfront line though maintaining a<br />\npronounced height advantage,<br />\nappeared to be nailed fast to the<br />\nfloor. More often than one cares<br />\nto remember, the visitors' Keven<br />\nRobinson, Rodney Floyd, and<br />\nGene Gwaizdowski, all no taller<br />\nthan 6 feet, outleaped 6-7 Bill<br />\nJews for easy tip-ins.<br />\nThe game got off to an<br />\nextremely strange start, albeit<br />\nonly a portent of things to come.<br />\n<br />\nspoRTs<br />\n<br />\nNeither side was able to connect<br />\nfrom the field until Floyd made a<br />\nbrilliant layup almost 4 minutes<br />\ninto the match. Not until Spence<br />\nhit form the corner at the 5.20<br />\nmark was JHU able to score a<br />\ntwo-pointer. Hopkins marlaged to<br />\ntake two leads midway in the<br />\nfirst half, each time off a Loyola<br />\nturnover.<br />\nJews hit a jumper off a<br />\nbeautiful feed from Al Robinson<br />\nto put the Jays in front at 18-16.<br />\nAfter Mark Rhode tied it,<br />\nSpence's rebound made it 20-18.<br />\nBut Loyola's stringbean sub<br />\ncenter Jim Smith hit two in a<br />\nrow and the Hounds had a lead<br />\nthey never relinquished.<br />\nJHU managed to keep it close<br />\nuntil the closing minutes when,<br />\nafter a Greg DeLong bucket cut<br />\nthe lead to 42-37, Rhode hit over<br />\nJews, and Gwaizdowski tallied a<br />\nthree point play to boost the<br />\nmargin to 47-37.

Morrison had never<br />\nplayed with a loser before and<br />\nthe way things started out, this<br />\ncampaign didn't appear to be an<br />\nexception. After all, this was the<br />\nteam which last year scratched<br />\nand clawed in the finals with<br />\nNova Scotia before bowing in a<br />\nheartstopping six games for the<br />\nCalder Cup.<br />\nAh, but this was also the team<br />\nthat was ravaged perhaps more<br />\nthan any other, for players to<br />\n<br />\nJim Morrison, a loser at last.<br />\n<br />\nstock the new rebel World<br />\nHockey Association (WHA). As a<br />\nresult there were only seven<br />\nplayers remaining from last year's<br />\nWestern division champions,<br />\nfavorites to have taken the Calder<br />\nCup.<br />\nMore<br />\nStill, this is nothing new in the<br />\nAHL where on opening night it<br />\npays to buy a program in order<br />\nto find out who's the hometown<br />\nteam. American hockey league<br />\nplayers are constantly being<br />\nshuffled and reshuffled, so why<br />\nthe sudden downfall into<br />\noblivion? Even oblivion sounds<br />\nmore enticing when compared to<br />\nthe Clippers' present standing,<br />\nstruggling to reach double figures<br />\nin the win column after 55<br />\ngames.<br />\nMuch of the answer has to do<br />\nwith the WHA raid on Baltimore<br />\nwhich cornered the Clippers'<br />\nfinest hockey players. Even the<br />\ncharacteristic shuffling of the<br />\nAHL at least provides<br />\nreplacement talent for what is<br />\nlost. The WHA gives no such<br />\nexchange in its war for talent<br />\nwith the established National<br />\nHockey League.<br />\nClever<br />\nStill, all the other AHL teams<br />\nwere raided, so why were the<br />\nClippers so handicapped? Some<br />\nsay it was because of Baltimore's<br />\nhigh standing but then why is it<br />\nNova Scotia (the Calder Cup<br />\nchampions) and Cincinnati didn't<br />\nfall apart?

The<br />\nClippers have lacked motivation<br />\nand are disspirited and<br />\nunemotional? all the makings for<br />\na disastrous season. It has<br />\nbecome a Clipper trademark to<br />\ngive up the initial goal or goals so<br />\nthat \"catch up hockey\" has been<br />\ncommonplace. The Clippers have<br />\nnot been discriminating either,<br />\nhaving played consistently poor<br />\nat home and on the road.<br />\nThe Clipper defense is porous,<br />\nwith age playing a big part in the<br />\nsuccess of younger rivals. It's a<br />\nwonder that Baltimore goalies<br />\nKen Lockett and Jim Shaw,have<br />\nheld up against a league leading<br />\nassault of 36 shots per game.<br />\nThe criticism directed at a one<br />\nline dependence on carrying the<br />\noffensive burden was also<br />\njustified.

Benton stated that a<br />\nfD<br />\nsurvey of recent mailings to<br /><br />\nstudents and faculty showed that<br />\nless than 50% of the letters were<br />\nread. \"How do you publicize<br />\nanything on this campus?\" asked<br />\nBenton.<br />\nThe Council restricted<br />\ndiscussion of the student housing<br />\nproblem to an outline of the four<br />\npossibilities to increase the<br />\nnumber of living units available<br />\nto the University: 1) New<br />\nUniversity housing which would<br />\nbe built by the University on or<br />\nnear campus. Benton criticized<br />\nthis proposal on the grounds that<br />\nit would be prohibitively<br />\nexpensive without<br />\ncontruction-loan subsidies. 2) A<br />\n\"turn-key\" operation which<br />\nwould have Corporation built<br />\nhousing on a special arrangement<br />\nbasis serving as student<br />\nresidences. 3) The purchase of<br />\nanother apartment house near<br />\ncampus is a possibility, but not a<br />\nlikely one. According to Benton<br />\nthe University will probably not<br />\npurchase another building near<br />\ncampus because of community<br />\nrelations, city tax, and zoning<br />\ndifficulties. 4) The gradual<br />\nacquisition of real estate around<br />\nHomewood into which student<br />\ncould be moved.<br /><br />\nCatering service sought by Food<br />\n' Committee<br />\nMackie, presently catering the.<br />\nLevering concession and Prophet,<br />\nnow servicing the dormitories.<br />\n\"Involved in the process of<br />\nselecting (the food company)are<br />\n3000 to 4000 pages of<br />\ndocuments,\" said Fitzpatrick.<br />\n\"They have given us sample<br />\nmenus, equipment reports, and<br />\nstatistics on the number of<br />\nemployees needed.\"<br />\nChris Marret, Hopkins<br />\nsophomore Food Committe<br />\nmember, stated that the Food<br />\nCommittee had evaluated Prophet<br />\nduring several meetings and that<br />\nhe had seen several problems<br />\nwith the company.<br />\n\"When Proplefirst came to the<br />\nUniversity several years ago the<br />\nadministration offered them<br />\n$30,000 for renovations,\" Marret<br />\nexplained. \"But they turned<br />\nlown the money saying 'all the<br />\ne quipment is good<br />\nenough'...Later, when the Food<br />\nCommitte toured the Dorm<br />\ncafeteria, the equipment really<br />\nlooked bad,\" he added.<br />\nMarret also indicated that the<br />\nFood Service Company changed<br />\nmanagers so often (four in the<br />\nlast to years) that Hopkins<br /><br />\nappears to be just a training spot<br />\nfor Propheremployees.<br />\nOn the other had, Fitzpatrick<br />\nsaid that the Dormitory service<br />\nhas undergone considerable<br />\nchanges.<br />\n\"They have submitted new<br />\nmenus,\" he said. \"We have also<br />\n;igned a new contract that will<br />\nimprove the quality (of the food)<br />\nfurther.\"<br />\nAccording to Marret, the Food<br />\nCommittee would like to see the<br />\nestablishment of one main dish at<br />\neach meal.<br />\n\"I think there should be a full<br />\nbreakfast,\" he asserted, \"and perhaps something more for<br />\nlunch.

I'd be willing to<br />\nkeep in touch with students at<br />\nHopkins so I could really give<br />\ntheir viewpoints at Board<br />\nmeetings.<br />\nFeinmark: I think , that<br />\nthe only qualification that's<br />\nnecessary is that you've been a<br />\nstudent here, and that you've<br />\nspent your time involved in the<br />\nevery day workings of the<br />\ncampus. I've been involved in a<br />\ncouple of different things, and I<br />\nknow my way around the<br /><br />\nis flexibility. In other words,<br />\nyou're. going into a situation<br />\nthat's fairly gooey; the rules are<br />\nnot completely set and it's not<br />\nparticularly clear what your role<br />\nis. In being flexible. I mean in<br />\ntaking input from the Trustees as<br />\nwell as from my peers, because it<br />\nseems clear to me one of the<br />\nfunctions of the young trustee is<br />\nto mediate between two groups:<br />\nthe people who run the<br />\nUniversity and the people who<br />\nattend the University. And often<br />\ntheir goals are very different.<br />\nBlock: I think I have a pretty<br />\ngood understanding of the way<br />\nthings are run on campus, and 1<br /><br />\nmain qualification as being one<br />\nof communication. I think<br />\neveryone sitting at this table will<br />\nagree that if you are selected to<br />\nbe the young trustee it's going to<br />\nbe a learning experience for you.<br />\nI'm sure everyone of your<br />\npreconceived notions are going to<br />\nbe changed once you get there.<br />\nBut from the experience I've had,<br />\nI think the Trustees look at us as<br />\na valuable source of information.<br />\nJust recently I had a meeting in<br />\nregard to the spring festival with<br />\nsome members of the class of<br />\n1923, as the festival will pay<br />\nspecial tribute to them.

There are a<br />\ncertain level of students involved<br />\nin those activities, and sometimes<br /><br />\nthere, and goes onto grad grad<br />\ngrad school is qualified to be a<br />\nyoung trustee either.

I've been on the<br />\nYearbook for four years, and I've<br />\ngotten to know a great deal<br />\naobut the operation of the<br />\ncampus through that. Also,<br />\nbecause we do a great deal of<br />\nYearbook trading with other<br />\nuniversities, you can get a pretty<br />\ngood feel of what other campus<br />\nattitudes across the nation are.<br />\nThat may be of some interest to<br />\nthe Board, but the main thing is<br />\nthat I feel I can communicate to<br />\nthe people on the Board.<br />\nKestigian:<br />\nI think one of the<br />\nthings I could say, which is<br />\ncertainly rare among my<br />\nacquaintances, is that I've been<br />\nabsolutely satisfied with my<br />\nHopkins experience. That, I<br />\nthink, makes me qualified,<br />\nbecause I have a real respect for<br />\nWhat this institution was set up<br />\nto do. In academics, in athletics<br />\nand campus organizations, I've<br />\nParticipated in a lot of different<br />\nthings.

For years undergraduates called for<br />\nteacher evaluation as one criterion for faculty<br />\npromotion with no response from the Academic'<br />\nCouncil. The Blue Ribbon Panel on Undergraduate<br />\nEducation considered the matter and decided to<br />\ninclude it in their list of recommendations. Last spring,<br />\nDean Owen stated that a new emphasis would be put \u2022<br />\non teaching ability in considering faculty promotion,<br />\nbut that no satisfactory means were available for<br />\njudging teaching ability other than the Course Guide<br />\nevaluation.<br />\nPresently the Student Council is considering a<br />\nformula for teacher evaluation drawn up by a Council<br />\nsub-committee. This plan sould not be underestimated<br />\nin its significance. The SC subcommittee<br />\nrecomendations embody a set of criteria, developed by<br />\nundergraduates, which surpass the feeble popularity<br />\njudgements serving as the bases of the Course Guide<br />\ncriteria. New input on teacher criteria by<br />\nundergraduates is not only necessary but will also be<br />\nwell received by the Academic Council. Hopefully the<br />\nStudent Council will have enough wisdom to adopt<br />\nthis plan which has the potential to provide Hopkins<br />\nwith a satisfactory means of evaluating teacher ability.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n, \u201e<br /><br />\nIECITAL Di<br /><br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\n\u2022k t<br /><br />\nyr,,' \u2022.\u201e1.11,; \u2022\u2022\u2022..\".v<br />\n.;1711,,NN11,<br />\n____Ll<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n10111ati Mak<br />\n110.10%,ft lie<br />\nan Nit<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n\\\\jai<br /><br />\nlarli111111111111<br />\n-$1111111111111111111<br /><br />\n...111111111111<br /><br />\nALL P<br />\n..IY,4k1).r.212<br /><br />\nStaff writers: Lloyd Berkowitz, Richard Bland, Sue Blum, John<br />\nBortz, Martin French, Peter Gardner, Jeff Greene, Ann Hayes,<br />\nAndy Lashley, Jerry Nesser, Bertha Polin, Mark Secor, Allen<br />\nShort, Michael Siegel, Pat Smithwick, Mitch Tenzer<br />\nsports staff: Mike Bereston, Steve Brown, Nils Brubaker, Robert<br />\nFreudlich, Gerry Greenfield, Barry Kemelhor, Chuck Slonim,<br />\nMike Slowinski, Lawrence Weinstein<br />\nproduction staff: S.

But there are some soft<br />\nprograms, which I think the students<br />\nknow as well as I do.<br />\n'way<br />\n\\v\u2022va s \u2022 '<br />\nlk%<br />\nyou know, sli171111er .s-Chaal courses are<br /><br />\nthe credit system itself?<br />\nIt's the system's fault, but the system<br />\nwasn't generated spontaneously. The<br />\nstudents are trying to survive in a highly<br />\ncompetitive atmosphere, and Hopkins is a<br />\nstep on the road but not the termination<br />\npoint for them. This makes it difficult to<br />\nbe philosophical....<br />\nWe all know that the credit system is<br />\nless than ideal, and we don't play this<br />\ngame with graduate students. ...But on<br />\nthe other hand, it's the way most<br />\ninstitutions evaluate students for graduate<br />\nor professional study, either credits or the<br />\nnumber of courses.<br />\nBut should this be the reason for<br />\nHopkins to keep the credit system?<br />\nNo one has yet come up with another<br />\nsystem you can use when you're dealing<br />\nwith a large pre-professional and<br />\npre-graduate group. ...The First Response<br />\nreport of last year described an<br />\nindependent study contract system, ...but<br />\nthat was never envisioned as representing<br />\nthe program of a substantial number of<br /><br />\ndisappear....

The only statement I want to<br />\nmake is that the whole quesiton is under<br />\nserious consideration by the<br />\nadministration at this time By spring<br />\nadvising, we'll know the guidelines.<br /><br />\nBy MICHAEL SIEGEL<br />\nUntil recently, the National Symphony<br />\nwas the subject of polite but derisive<br />\nlaughter among Washingtonians. Under<br />\nthe amiable but aimless direction of<br />\nHoward Mitchelo, the Symphony, playing<br />\nat the cavernous and usually half-empty<br />\nDAR Constituiton Hall, was considered<br />\nmediocre at best, an opinion underscored<br />\nby the frequent and always sole-out<br />\nappearances of other orchestras, such as<br />\nthose of Philadelphia, London, and<br />\nVienna.<br /><br />\nBut Washingtonians needn't laugh nay<br />\nmore. In the last several years, the<br />\nfortunes of the National Symphony have<br />\ntaken a sudden and dramatic turn for the<br />\nbetter. Performances are now given at the<br />\nConcert Hall of the new Kennedy Center<br />\nfor the Performing Arts, an auditorium<br />\nwhich is acoustically magnificent, if not<br />\narchitecturally so, and are for the most<br />\npart very well attended. But more<br />\nimportantly, the reknown Antal Dorati<br />\nhas taken on the leadership of the<br />\norchestra.

I<br />\nhave no intention of saying students can't<br />\ntake courses elsewhere.<br />\nOne thing we'd like to do is to open up<br />\nthe Evening College. ...There's<br />\nmisdirection in the current operating<br />\nrules, because part of the form day school<br />\npeople fill out requires them to justify<br />\ntheir taking an Evening College course.<br />\nMy view is about 180 degrees from that<br />\nstatement of justification. The Evening<br />\nCollege should be used to diversify the<br />\nundergraduate program. ...I would expect<br />\nthat if a course is offered in the Natural<br />\nSciences, for example, in the day school<br />\nthat's required for someone majoring in<br />\nthat area, the student would take it in the<br />\nday school. But if a student wants to take<br />\na course in the Evening College that's not<br />\nin his major, that should be fine, although<br />\nI would think that some limit would be<br />\nput on the total number of credits<br />\ncoming from the Evening College that<br />\ncould be used towards graduation.<br />\nBut do you think that the existing<br />\ncredit system should be continued? I<br />\nthink a lot of people are dissatisfied with<br />\nit. Let rne quote Dr. Laurence Holland<br />\nfrom a March 1972 News-Letter:<br />\n\"There's less chance at Hopkins for an<br />\nundergrad to explore his full range of<br />\ninterests. Attention is fragmented. A<br />\nstudent can't work as intensively on any<br />\none course or independent study project<br />\nas at places where the course load ism<br />\nmore concentrated (i.e. in fewer<br />\ncourses).\"<br />\nIf I could devise a system which would<br />\nwork, I would put us on a subject basis<br />\nand get us off credits and numbers. There<br />\nare smaller schools, such as<br />\nManhantanville, which don't have a credit<br />\nsystem and instead judge students by<br />\ncuriculum content and with frequent<br />\nfaculty evaluations. ...But we can't mold<br />\nourselves in their image any more than<br />\nthey (smaller schools)can do all what we<br />\ncan do right now. We can certainly<br />\nde-emphasize credits, and I think the<br />\nfaculty would be delighted with that.<br />\nWhy?<br />\nBecause the credit system ties them to<br />\nnumbers. It's a system of currency.<br />\nDollars become credits. A lot of<br />\nbargaining goes on. People shop around<br />\nfor courses, and this occurrs often enough<br />\nto give the feeling of a marketplace....<br />\nBut don't you think this is the fault of<br /><br />\nI iii not all<br /><br />\nraising graduation<br /><br />\nrequirements to 130 credits, if that's<br />\nwhat you mean. ...Decisions are going to<br />\nbe made before spring advising, because<br />\nthe decisions will have a bearing on<br />\nstudents' academic plans for the summer<br />\nand next fall. But I can't picture making a<br />\nmajor revision of credit requirements or<br />\ndegree requirements.<br />\nOne thing I will say is that before you<br />\nknock the credit system, you should talk<br />\nto some of the students I think many of<br />\nthem like the present system. They like<br />\nthe it because it gives them a target,<br />\nsomething predictable. There's less doubt<br />\nin their minds for when requirements for<br />\na degree can be met, and the<br />\nprogramming of courses is simpler. I m<br />\nnot sure you would find objections to the<br />\ncredit system so strong among students.<br />\nBut we agree that the system isn't all<br />\nthat it could be, that there are valid<br />\nobjections to it. What changes do you<br />\nthink are possible?<br />\nI could see ways to make the credit<br />\nsystem more flexible. Let's say you<br />\nrequire a student, going into any field, to<br />\ntake 96 credits in that field -the<br />\neducational core\u2014and then set another<br />\nnumber for filling in that would be wide<br />\nopen for the student. The core area<br />\nwould need to be defined with some care.<br />\nw=.-a t the constraints and what the<br />\nexposure should be. There would be no<br />\nmore battles of points, and it would leave<br />\nthe student free to do as he or she would<br />\nlike.<br />\nAnother topic which has come up<br />\nrecently is that of early graduation. How<br />\nmany people have graduated early this<br />\nyear, and is this number larger than it has<br />\nbeen in the past?<br />\nThe trend is that the number is<br />\nincreasing significantly. Without having<br />\nseen any specific figures\u2014I'm just dealing<br />\nin round numbers right now\u2014I would say<br />\nthat at least double the number who<br />\ngraduated early last year will do so this<br />\nyear. Again, this is coupled to having to<br />\nhave 120 credits. There's been a<br />\nnoticeable shift from 10 or 15 years ago<br />\nwhen programs exceeding 120 credits was<br />\nthe rule. More and more people now aim<br />\nfor only the mininium, and I get requests<br />\nfrom people who want to graduate with<br />\n117. It calls into question the whole<br />\nprocess of putting numbers on courses.<br />\nThe number of students who are going<br />\ntowards an early graduation<br />\nquite<br />\nlegitimately, which I want to stress, is<br />\ngoing to increase as long as the financial<br />\nsituation remains as it is....<br />\nIf the undergraduate school could<br />\ndevelop some method for eliminating<br />\ntuition (this is pie in the sky I'm talking<br />\nabout), I would wager that this whole<br />\nissue (of early graduation) would<br /><br />\nThe fifty-five works on exhibit in the<br /><br />\ngallery at the Eisenhower Library,<br />\nthrough March 2, are representative of a<br />\nvariety of meduims, running the gamut of<br />\nwater colors, oils, collages, etchings, and<br />\npen and ink.

Of all the Blue Jays who<br />\nsaw more than limited action,<br />\nonly John Rutter, Al Robinson,<br />\nand Paul Spence appeared to<br />\nhustle throughout. The remaining<br />\nmembers seemed convinced that<br />\nthe game was nothing more than<br />\na scrimmage; as a result, the<br />\nhighly partisan crowd, not known<br />\nfor their love of referees, booed<br />\ntheir own team more than the<br />\nofficials.<br />\nThe story of the game could<br />\nGreg Delong meets the opposition. not be told by the shooting<br />\npercentages. The visiting<br /><br />\nNWS-LETFER<br /><br />\nGreyhounds canned 34 of 77<br />\nfrom the field, or 44.1%. JHU<br />\nmade 33 of 75 shots, or 44%.<br />\nFrom the free throw line, Loyola<br />\ntallied on 26 of 35 for 74% while<br />\ntheir hosts hit 24 or 30 for 80%.<br />\nThe difference in this contest<br />\nwas under the backboards.<br />\nLoyola grabbed 54 caroms while<br />\nthe Jays had only 39. Many of<br />\nthe \"Hounds\" rebounds were on<br />\noffense, allowing them two or<br />\nmore shots at the basket. On<br />\nthese occasions, the Hopkins<br />\nfront line though maintaining a<br />\npronounced height advantage,<br />\nappeared to be nailed fast to the<br />\nfloor. More often than one cares<br />\nto remember, the visitors' Keven<br />\nRobinson, Rodney Floyd, and<br />\nGene Gwaizdowski, all no taller<br />\nthan 6 feet, outleaped 6-7 Bill<br />\nJews for easy tip-ins.<br />\nThe game got off to an<br />\nextremely strange start, albeit<br />\nonly a portent of things to come.<br /><br />\nspoRTs<br /><br />\nNeither side was able to connect<br />\nfrom the field until Floyd made a<br />\nbrilliant layup almost 4 minutes<br />\ninto the match. Not until Spence<br />\nhit form the corner at the 5.20<br />\nmark was JHU able to score a<br />\ntwo-pointer. Hopkins marlaged to<br />\ntake two leads midway in the<br />\nfirst half, each time off a Loyola<br />\nturnover.<br />\nJews hit a jumper off a<br />\nbeautiful feed from Al Robinson<br />\nto put the Jays in front at 18-16.<br />\nAfter Mark Rhode tied it,<br />\nSpence's rebound made it 20-18.<br />\nBut Loyola's stringbean sub<br />\ncenter Jim Smith hit two in a<br />\nrow and the Hounds had a lead<br />\nthey never relinquished.<br />\nJHU managed to keep it close<br />\nuntil the closing minutes when,<br />\nafter a Greg DeLong bucket cut<br />\nthe lead to 42-37, Rhode hit over<br />\nJews, and Gwaizdowski tallied a<br />\nthree point play to boost the<br />\nmargin to 47-37.

Morrison had never<br />\nplayed with a loser before and<br />\nthe way things started out, this<br />\ncampaign didn't appear to be an<br />\nexception. After all, this was the<br />\nteam which last year scratched<br />\nand clawed in the finals with<br />\nNova Scotia before bowing in a<br />\nheartstopping six games for the<br />\nCalder Cup.<br />\nAh, but this was also the team<br />\nthat was ravaged perhaps more<br />\nthan any other, for players to<br /><br />\nJim Morrison, a loser at last.<br /><br />\nstock the new rebel World<br />\nHockey Association (WHA). As a<br />\nresult there were only seven<br />\nplayers remaining from last year's<br />\nWestern division champions,<br />\nfavorites to have taken the Calder<br />\nCup.<br />\nMore<br />\nStill, this is nothing new in the<br />\nAHL where on opening night it<br />\npays to buy a program in order<br />\nto find out who's the hometown<br />\nteam. American hockey league<br />\nplayers are constantly being<br />\nshuffled and reshuffled, so why<br />\nthe sudden downfall into<br />\noblivion? Even oblivion sounds<br />\nmore enticing when compared to<br />\nthe Clippers' present standing,<br />\nstruggling to reach double figures<br />\nin the win column after 55<br />\ngames.<br />\nMuch of the answer has to do<br />\nwith the WHA raid on Baltimore<br />\nwhich cornered the Clippers'<br />\nfinest hockey players. Even the<br />\ncharacteristic shuffling of the<br />\nAHL at least provides<br />\nreplacement talent for what is<br />\nlost. The WHA gives no such<br />\nexchange in its war for talent<br />\nwith the established National<br />\nHockey League.<br />\nClever<br />\nStill, all the other AHL teams<br />\nwere raided, so why were the<br />\nClippers so handicapped? Some<br />\nsay it was because of Baltimore's<br />\nhigh standing but then why is it<br />\nNova Scotia (the Calder Cup<br />\nchampions) and Cincinnati didn't<br />\nfall apart? Cincinnati leads the<br />\nWest and Nova Scotia heads the<br />\nEast.<br />\nTo this, there is no<br />\nexplanation and anybody who<br />\nsaw the feeble contact the<br />\nClippers have generated this<br />\nseason compared to their rivals,<br /><br />\nthe reason goes far deeper. The<br />\nClippers have lacked motivation<br />\nand are disspirited and<br />\nunemotional? all the makings for<br />\na disastrous season. It has<br />\nbecome a Clipper trademark to<br />\ngive up the initial goal or goals so<br />\nthat \"catch up hockey\" has been<br />\ncommonplace. The Clippers have<br />\nnot been discriminating either,<br />\nhaving played consistently poor<br />\nat home and on the road.<br />\nThe Clipper defense is porous,<br />\nwith age playing a big part in the<br />\nsuccess of younger rivals. It's a<br />\nwonder that Baltimore goalies<br />\nKen Lockett and Jim Shaw,have<br />\nheld up against a league leading<br />\nassault of 36 shots per game.<br />\nThe criticism directed at a one<br />\nline dependence on carrying the<br />\noffensive burden was also<br />\njustified. The Rivard, Murphy,<br />\nDufour line was devastating in<br /><br />\nseason;<br />\nthe initial stages of the<br />\nup<br />\n\"wised<br />\nBut then opponents<br />\ndown<br />\nbearing<br />\nand began<br />\npotent<br />\nwhenever the most<br />\neven<br />\nClipper line hit the ice.

I think the on the Homewood campus. I<br />\npeople on the Board have shown think my main function would<br />\nan interest in what goes on, and be to keep the 52 members of<br />\nthe current young trustees I've the Board informed as to what's<br />\ntalked to seem to think there is a happening here. The Board sits in<br />\nvehicle in the young trusteeship their meetings with wonderful<br />\nwith which you can get things intentions but I don't think they<br />\naccomplished.

I feel that as one<br />\nof the first women at Hopkins, I<br />\ncan sympathize or empathize<br />\nwith the problems of the<br />\nminority groups here, such as<br />\nthose women face. Every student<br />\nat Hopkins has problems, but I<br />\nfeel that women need to be<br />\nrepresented too.<br />\nQ:: If a Board member<br />\napproached you, and asked<br />\n\"How do you think you are<br />\nqualified,\" how would you<br />\nrespond?<br />\nhonestly<br />\nKlemmer: I don't<br />\nknow what qualifications others<br />\non the Board have met, but I<br />\nguess my best qualification<br />\nwould be--if the purpose of the<br />\nyoung trustee is to bridge the gap<br />\nbetween the men in the business<br />\nworld and the students at<br />\nHopkins who have to deal with<br />\nHopkins every day\u2014that I have<br /><br />\nQ: What provoked you to run?<br />\nBob C.

Young: Like Bob, I've<br />\nalso gained some familiarity with<br />\nthe problems here, and I'm tired<br />\nof confronting problems that<br />\nstop me in my tracks. Too often<br />\nI'm told there's just no authority<br />\nin one office or another to do<br />\nsomething about them. On some<br />\nof the things that bother me, the<br />\nBoard can affect a change. For<br />\ninstnace, I've criticized some<br />\npeople concerning the parkIng<br />\nsituation, and I later learned<br />\nthere was a standing committee 0)<br />\non the Board which could do<br />\nsomething about it.<br />\nEight Young Trustee candidates interviewed:(1 to r)Kathy Klemmer, Steve Feinmark, Rick Kinnaird,<br />\nNelson Block Through.
