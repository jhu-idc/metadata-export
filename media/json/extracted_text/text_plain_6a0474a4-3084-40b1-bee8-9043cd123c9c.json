Following approval of the agreement<br />\nby President Gordon the Strike<br />\nCommittee voted overwhelmingly<br />\nto suspend the strike and continue<br />\nnegotiations on the other demands.<br />\nNegotiations were highly emotional. At one point early in the<br />\ntalks, Dr. Richard Pfeffer, another<br />\nStrike Committee negotiator, told<br />\nadministrators, \"I think you guys<br />\nare not here to negotiate,\" and<br />\nstomped out. Pfeffer's outburst<br />\nhad a sobering effect on the meeting. \"Several people either broke<br />\ndown or were in tears,\" stated<br />\nDr. Pepper. Upon Pfeffer's return,<br />\nthe meeting started moving.<br />\nStrike Committee negotiator<br />\nDr. Steven Pepper called the settlement \"better than anybody expected.\"<br />\nRecruiting Suspended<br />\nThe substance of the agreement<br />\nhas military recruiting suspended<br />\non the Homewood Campus unless<br />\nten percent of the student body<br />\npetitions for such recruitment be.fore May 1. In that case, an all-student referendum will be held on<br />\nthe matter. Any referendum must<br />\nbe held before May l or military<br />\nrecruiting will be permanently banned.<br />\nThe outcome of the referendum<br />\nwould be decided by a majority of<br />\nthose voting. The faculty would<br />\nnot vote unless the General Assembly decided to take up the issue.<br />\nIf that happened, the faculty vote<br />\nwould be added to the referendum<br />\nresults on a one-man, one-vote basis. The faculty cannot initiate the<br />\ncall for the referendum, and, in<br />\nany case, the vote wuold be binding.<br />\nIn further agreements, Benton<br />\nstated that a student-faculty committee would be drawn up to work<br />\nover the summer on a .r:\u20222w governance system to be instituted in<br />\nthe fall. Negotiations on the makeUP of the committee will be held<br />\nnext week.<br />\nThe Strike Committee is calling<br />\nfor a noon rally today in commemoration of the Vietnamese<br />\ndead, which they describe as \"a<br />\nre-dedication to the struggle.\"<br />\nThey also have called a meeting to<br />\nPlan next week's negotiations.<br />\npie by Weingarten<br />\n<br />\nStrikers hope to have the issues of<br />\nAPL and ROTC included in these<br />\ndiscussions. Benton gave a verbal<br />\ncommittment that the Academic<br />\nCouncil would act quickly on the<br />\nrecommendations of the Committee on Student Relations concerning ROTC. (See page 3.) Strikers<br />\ndropped the demand calling for an<br />\ninvestigation of Gordon's actions<br />\nduring the past few days.<br />\nEmotion-Filled<br />\nThe final agreement was ironed<br />\nout in a three-hour emotion-filled session last night, the second<br />\nsuch session in as many days. The<br />\nstrikers took the results back to a<br />\nLevering Hall Strike Committee<br />\nmeeting which had originally been<br />\ncalled to plan tactics for today.<br />\nApplause broke out after the agreement was announced.<br />\nBenton and Bevan took the results to Gordon's house where he<br />\napproved them. When his approval<br />\nwas relayed to the Levering meeting the strikers broke out in a chorus of wild applause, added their<br />\naffirmative vote and suspended<br />\nFriday's strike.<br />\nFollowing Wednesday's bargaining session, there remained disagreement Over the question of military recruiting. Strikers wanted<br />\nrecruiting banned as a University<br />\npolicy. They maintained that only<br />\na new governance system should<br />\nhave the power to alter the policy;<br />\nand then only if it chose to discuss<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nBenton and Bevan had proposed<br />\nthat the recruiting be suspended<br />\nfor a specified period at which<br />\ntime new governing body would<br />\ndecide the question.<br />\nThe Strike Committee negotiating team consisted of Drs. Pepper<br />\nand Pfeffer, Chris Ohly, Larry<br />\nGoldberg, Roger Faxon, John<br />\nGuess, Bob Cotter, Steve Asin, Peter Harnik and Dr. Steven Mann.<br />\nSame Ten Back<br />\nThursday the ten strikers reported these results to an afternoon<br />\nmeeting which affirmed the strikers' position and sent the same<br />\nten back to the evening session.<br />\nThe agreement followed a day<br />\nof escalating strike activities which<br />\nsaw class attendance drop by over<br />\n50 percent from normal. Picket<br />\nlines were set up at all University<br />\nentrances. Four picketers reported<br />\nthat they were struck by vehicles<br />\ndriving through the lines. including<br />\nLarry Spetka, who said he was hit<br />\nby a car driven by Stephen Nem-<br />\n<br />\nphes, Chief University Accountant.<br />\nNemphes drove through the picket<br />\nline after the strikers refused to allow him to enter the campus without taking a leaflet. The incident<br />\noccurred at the Art Museum Drive<br />\nentrance to the campus. Spetka is<br />\npressing charges against Nemphes<br />\nfor leaving the scene of an accident.<br />\nThursday morning, James Claxton, President of Local Union<br />\n1231, which represents some 450<br />\nHopki us \u2022 nonprofessional workers,<br />\nannounced his support of the<br />\nstrike.<br />\nWednesday evening the Student<br />\nCouncil voted overwhelmingly in<br />\nfavor of the strike.<br />\nA meet ing\"of the General Assembly has been called for this afternoon at 4 p.m. by Vice-Chairman<br />\n<br />\nMichael Beer. Beer stated that<br />\nmany faculty had requested such a<br />\nmeeting, which he termed \"informational.\" The Assembly, which<br />\nis open to a limited number of<br />\nstudent observers, will i\u2022hear a statement by Benton.<br />\nGrants Jeopardized<br />\nIt was also revealed Thursday<br />\nthat the University receives nearly<br />\n5500,000 in research grants which<br />\nwould be jeopardized if military<br />\nrecruiters were barred from campus. The grants come from NASA<br />\nand are awarded under a bill which<br />\nstates that \"colleges and Universities that bar armed forces recruiters from their campuses will not be<br />\neligible for funds.\"<br />\n(continued on page 3)<br />\n<br />\nStrikers Seek Injunction<br />\n\"We are moving to protect<br />\nthose in our movement against<br />\nany repressive or retaliatory act<br />\nby the administration, by asking<br />\nfor a court injunction enjoining<br />\nthe University and its agents from<br />\ninterfering with the rights of strikers,\" the Hopkins Strike Committee announced yesterday.<br />\nThe attorney for the strikers,<br />\nWilliam H. Murphy, explained the<br />\naction as a \"positive sort of action,<br />\nthat doesn't freeze anyone,\" and<br />\nthat just preserves \"law and<br />\norder\".<br />\nMurphy was uncertain whether he would file suite on Friday<br />\nor the following Monday. \"I'm<br />\ngoing to try to get it filed tomorrow (Friday)\", he said, but explained that an important case<br />\npreviously scheduled for Friday<br />\nmight necessitate his putting off<br />\nfiling until Monday.<br />\nHe gave the suit a 50-50<br />\nchance of success, explaining that<br />\n\"the courts in this part of the<br />\ncountry have not been the friendliest\" to such causes. Any hope<br />\nof success which he entertained<br />\nhe based on the fact that \"We're<br />\nwithin the law and are just asking<br />\nfor rights.\"<br />\nSome Reasons<br />\nThe strike committee explained their reason for the injunction as, \"in the past, this University has subtly and not-so-subtly<br />\ntampered with the rights of dis<br />\ntampered with the rights of dissent and free expression on campus.\" Murphy added that the<br />\nstrikers had \"reason to believe<br />\n<br />\n...tenure nas been tampered with.\"<br />\nHe further charged the University<br />\nwith \"an old concept of what a<br />\nstudent should be, a slave or a<br />\nvassal.\"<br />\nMurphy also cast legal doubts<br />\non the recently formulated student<br />\ndiscipline code, pointing out that<br />\nstudents have certain constitutional rights which may not be respected by the Code, such as the<br />\nright of the accused to inspect<br />\nany evidence to be used against<br />\nhim, to be informed of the witnesses against him and any written<br />\ndepositions they may have made,<br />\nand to be bound by published<br />\nrules which are not so vague as to<br />\nbe limiting to First Amendment<br />\nrights.<br />\nTo Insure<br />\nThe injunction would attempt to insure these and various<br />\nother legal rights to students, as<br />\nwell as defining any limitations<br />\nof . free political expression to<br />\ncases of clear and present danger<br />\nof serious violations of law.<br />\nMurphy elaborated that the<br />\ninjunction would seek to prohibit<br />\nloss of tenure or other sorts of<br />\nintimidation by the University towards its professors or employees<br />\nas a result of participation in demonstrations or political activities.<br />\nThe injunction, according to<br />\nMurphy, would \"make it possible<br />\nfor students to voice their dissent.\" Thus it would seek to bar<br />\nthe use of offensive weapons, such<br />\nas nightsticks, MACE, etc., on<br />\ncampus by police, or any other<br />\ngroup.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nApril 24,1970<br />\n<br />\nBrazilian Accuses Gordon of Supporting Coup<br />\nBy MARC KRIZACK<br />\nSpeaking at Shriver Hall Wednesday afternoon, Marcio Alves,<br />\nCongressman - in - exile from<br />\nBrazil, accused Dr. Lincoln Gordon, former U.S. Ambassador to<br />\nBrazil, of full knowledge and tacit<br />\nsupport of the military coup which<br />\noverthrew the constitutional government of Brazil in 1964.<br />\nIn describing Gordon's role in<br />\nthe military coup, Alves called<br />\nhim, \"one of the midwives of this<br />\nregime.\" The 1964 coup, disguised as reformed constitutional<br />\nlaw, \"came as no surprise to the<br />\nUnited States,\" said Alves. \"In<br />\nfact,\" continued Alves,\"the coup<br />\nwas helped by the United States<br />\nembassy\"<br />\nMarcio Alves was originally<br />\nbrought to Hopkins by Manuel<br />\nRodriguez to debate Dr. Gordon<br />\nover the issue of the 1964 coup.<br />\nRodriguez pointed out that in<br />\nGordon's address to the crowd<br />\ngathered<br />\naround<br />\nHomewood<br />\nHouse over the weekend, he stated that he would debate about<br />\nBrazil with \"anyone, anytime.\"<br />\nIn his written statement, sent to<br />\nfaculty and students, concerning<br />\nthis week's anti-military protests<br />\non campus, Gordon specifically<br />\nstated that he had kept his calendar open for April 22 -- if anyone wanted to meet with him to<br />\ndiscuss the issues in which this<br />\ncampus is currently embroiled.<br />\nYet, according to Rodriguez<br />\nDr. Gordon had left for a meeting of the American Association<br />\n<br />\nof Universities in Washington<br />\nWednesday morning.

Faculty<br />\nmembers,<br />\ntenured and non-tenured, and students,<br />\ngraduates and undergraduates, were all<br />\nallowed to express their views.<br />\nAccording to the report, the Committee on Undergraduate Education is to<br />\nreview and then recommend resolution<br />\nof grievances about education. Such<br />\ntopics as admissions, curriculum, improved teaching, and a meaningful mini-<br />\n<br />\nmester are to be included in the investigation. Other topics are not excluded,<br />\nhowever, and no time limit for reporting the results has been set.<br />\nPolicy-Making<br />\nThe new governance task force will<br />\ndeal with the recommendations in terms<br />\nof policy making in the Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. The report stated that<br />\nthe issues involved are; provisionwithin the present framework for better<br />\ncommunication and representation on<br />\nall levels for undergraduates graduates,<br />\nand non-tenured faculty; clarification<br />\nof the lines of authority; and rationalization of the committee structure.<br />\nThe committee recommend that membership of a special committee on undergraduate educt<br />\ngraduate education consist of the Provost, the Associate Dean of Undergrad- .<br />\n<br />\nuate Studies, two tenured and two nontenured faculty, two undergraduates,and<br />\none graduate student. The task force<br />\nis to consist of the Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences, one tenured and one nontenured faculty, one graduate student<br />\nand one undergraduate.<br />\nThis group<br />\nshould have its report for the General<br />\nAssembly and the Academic Council by<br />\nDecember 1, 1970.<br />\nThe procedure for the canvass of the<br />\ncommunity varied from group to group.<br />\nThe faculty were interviewed; views of<br />\nadministrative committees with studentfaculty membership were solicited (only<br />\n3 of 12 replied); students attended open<br />\nforums and took part in polls.<br />\nDecisive Voice<br />\nForty-seven per cent of the 531 undergraduates polled expressed dissatisfaci<br />\n<br />\n4 crowd offrom 200 to 500 persons gathered in front of Homewood House for a rally, Wednesday, the first day of the strike.<br />\n<br />\nGovernance<br />\nUnsettled<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n. 4440<br />\nAlma,<br />\n<br />\nStrikers in front of Homewood House which<br />\nwas hit by a bomb scare late Wednesday night.<br />\n<br />\n(continued from page I)<br />\nPickets manned the lines in scant numbers on Wednesday, but were out in force<br />\nThursday morning, stopping most people<br />\nfrom coming on campus. Besides Spetka,<br />\nDavid Charry and John Moriarty reported<br />\nbeing struck by vehicles moving through<br />\nthe lines. Dr Richard Pfeffer claimed that<br />\nhe was forced to jump out of the way<br />\nof the path of a car driven by Dr. Ferdinand Hamburger, Director of the Centennial Planning Committee. Many students<br />\nreported similar near-misses. Because<br />\nof the danger of further incidents, picket lines were called in at the beginning<br />\nof the Strike Committee's meeting at 3<br />\np.m.<br />\nOther Thursday actions included class<br />\ndisruption. Strikers in conjunction with<br />\nEnvironmental Teach-In organizers entered class meetings and asked for them<br />\nto discuss the strike issues. Participants<br />\nreported moderate success.<br />\n<br />\nEnd of ROTC Predicted<br />\nThe end of ROTC at Hopkins has been<br />\npredicted by the Committee on Student<br />\nRelations, a subcommittee of the Academic Council chaired by Edwin S. Mills,<br />\nProfessor of Political Economy.<br />\nIn the committee report issued yesterdaY but dated April 17, the committee<br />\nannounced that it was \"ursanknous in<br />\nbelieving that the present status of ROTC<br />\nat Johns Hopkins is unsatisfactory\" and<br />\nthat \"major changes should be made.\"<br />\nA majority of the committee,accrilinng<br />\nto the report, \"believes that FliOTC is inconsistent with the basic goals of the<br />\nUniversity and that ROTC should be ended<br />\nas soon as possible, consistent with orderly termination of the contract.\"<br />\nThe minority viewpoint was that ROTC<br />\nshould be treated as an extracurricular<br />\nactivity, thus witholding departmental<br />\n<br />\nstatus from ROTC and academic status from its instructors. If a new contract cannot be negotiated, \"the minority urges that ROTC be terminated,\"<br />\nthe report stated.<br />\nThe statement concluded that, \"Although the minority urges the University<br />\nto make a serious attempt to renegotiate the contract, it is not sanguine that<br />\na satisfactory contract is possible.\"<br />\nMills explained that other colleges<br />\nwhich have attempted to relegate ROTC<br />\nto an extracurricular activity have been<br />\nunable to do so to the satisfaction of the<br />\narmed forces and have been forced to<br />\nterminate their contracts.<br />\nHe also claimed that the committee<br />\nwas \"absolutely uninfluenced by the<br />\nevents of the past few days, and had<br />\nreached its decision over a week ago.\"<br />\n<br />\npix by Weingarten<br />\n<br />\ntion with governance; while 13 per cent<br />\nexpressed satisfaction with the status<br />\nquo. A majority of these students want<br />\na decisive voice in extra-curricular<br />\nactivities, their own conduct, and course<br />\nofferings. They want to be consulted on<br />\nall other academic affairs of the University.<br />\nMost faculty interviews gave support<br />\nto the undergraduates' desires. However, the faculty wished to maintain its<br />\nsuperiority over curriculum. A sizeable<br />\nminority of the undergraduates, 21 per<br />\ncent, were willing to devote at least five<br />\nhou'rs per week or inure to governance.<br />\nThe canvass found that graduate students agree with the rest of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity that the main problem concerns undergraduates. Their complaints<br />\ndeal with a larger formal role in their<br />\ntraditional role of consultation for academic affairs on the departmental level.<br />\nThey also express a desire for a larger<br />\nsay in University-wide decisions due to<br />\ndiscontent with the committee structure.<br />\nThe tenured faculty expressed dissatisfaction especially about the lines of<br />\nauthority, particularly in committees.<br />\nThey also asserted that the academic<br />\ncouncil was overworked and that the<br />\npower of the administration for administrative appointments and research<br />\ngrants was not monitored by faculty.<br />\nJunior faculty felt that teaching and<br />\nresearch were hindered by the quantitative requirements of publication. Some<br />\nof these faculty who are primarily involved in departmental affairs, want a formal channel in decisions for the whole<br />\nU niversity.<br />\nAdministrators were dissatisfied with<br />\ntheir responsibility in relationwith their<br />\npower. Those polled Telt excessively<br />\ninvolved with the details of student relations and preempted by special interest<br />\ngroups of faculty and students. A strain<br />\nin the University tradition of faculty<br />\nself-government has thus resulted.<br />\n<br />\nSAC Again Refuses<br />\nReferendum Request<br />\nBy ibNDY GREEN<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee voted<br />\ndown for the second time in three dayia<br />\nproposal that it hold a referendum on<br />\nmilitary recruiting on campus.<br />\nSAC Chairman Dr. John White and the<br />\nother committee members who had resigned after a controversial Monday night<br />\nmeeting tentatively decided to remain on<br />\nthe committee.<br />\nThe vote on military recruiting came<br />\nafter two hours of often angry debate<br />\nWednesday afternoon. SAC Chairman<br />\nDr. John White proposed the motion after<br />\nAlex Sotir, a committee member, petitioned the SAC to allow military recruiters on campus. In responding to<br />\nSotir's petition, the SAC acted on its own<br />\nrecommendation regarding recruitment.<br />\nPassed Monday night, that recommendation proposed that no recruiters<br />\nbe allowed on campus until someone presented a petition requesting such recruiting. That recommendation was passed<br />\nafter an initial proposal to conduct a referendum was defeated.<br />\nPresident Lincoln Gordon has not<br />\nresponded publicly to the SAC's recommendation. Dr. White, however,stated at<br />\nthe Wednesday meeting that Gordon had<br />\ntold him in private that the proposalwas<br />\nunacceptable to him.<br />\nArguing consistently in favor of a referendum, White pointed out that Gordon<br />\nhas previously declared that be would<br />\naccept the SAC's inierpretabon of the<br />\nresults of such a poll as binding.<br />\nStating that \"it is pointkess for us to<br />\nact upon a policy that has not yet been<br />\nmade policy,\" Dr. Jam S. Mann another<br />\nSAC member,alleged that tne referendum<br />\nmotion was out of order. Mann termed<br />\nGordon's failure to acknowledge the<br />\nCommittee's recommendation \"an insult.\" He then moved that hearings be<br />\nheld by the SAC onthe subject of recruit-<br />\n<br />\nment but that a decision be delayed until<br />\na new university governance system is<br />\ninstituted. The motion was never voted<br />\nupon.<br />\nWhite alleged that the SAC would be<br />\n\"clogging the channels of democracy\" if<br />\nit refused to conduct a referendum. The<br />\nreferendum would also set a precedent,<br />\nclaimed White, in deciding major campus issues in a democratic fashion.<br />\nWhen it was finally brought to a vote,<br />\nthe referendum motion w as defeated, 5-4.<br />\nPrior to the debate over the referendum, Mann announced that he would<br />\ncirculate a letter in rebuttal to Dr.<br />\nWhite's letter of resignation circulated<br />\nTuesday. White's letter censured the SAC<br />\nfor its original refusal to conduct a referendum. Mann's letter states that the<br />\nCommittee was completely in order in<br />\nmoving to ban recruiters after a democratically conducted meeting.<br />\nAlso signing the letter that Mann had<br />\npresented are committee members Chris<br />\nOhly, John Guess,Robert Cotter,Richard<br />\nConvisor, and Stuart Seidel. Convisor is<br />\nsigning the letter although he did not<br />\nattend the Monday night meeting because<br />\nhe claims to be \"familiar enough\" with<br />\nthe facts of the meeting and in support<br />\nof the spirit of the letter.<br />\nDr. White, who had submitted his resignation to Dean Allyn Kimball on Tuesday, announced that be had decided at<br />\nKimball's request to remain as chairman.<br />\nIt was then decided that the resignations<br />\nof weer&I other cumin Him* members in-c.leding Mapes had not been tendered<br />\nformally, and were not accepted. Tbe<br />\nSAC therefore remains latact.<br />\nThe resignations of Seidel and Ohly<br />\nhave to be considered by the Student<br />\nCouncil and Cotter's has to be heard<br />\nby the Graduate Student Organization.<br />\nMann's resignation has to be considered<br />\nby Dean Kimball.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nApril 24, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nVolpe: The Auto Is Deadly<br />\nBy RALPH MOLLER<br />\nVolpe, Secretary of<br />\nJohn<br />\nTransportation, kicked off the<br />\nHopkins Environmental Teachin Wednesday night with an address in which he discussed transportation and the environment.<br />\nAmong the things he covered<br />\nwere land-use planning, mass<br />\ntransit and the role of government in transportation and the<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nVolpe explained that a lot of<br />\nstructures have been designed<br />\nwithout regard to their effects<br />\non their surroundings.

The other is the<br />\nquestion of University governance. Another year is gone<br />\nand the Howard committee has announced that it will take<br />\nthe revolutionary step of recommending the appointment<br />\nof more committees. The administration asked the strikers<br />\nto \"trust us\" and those at the Strike Committee meeting in<br />\nLevering Hall. decided to do so. One thing is for certain: the<br />\nrelationship between administrators and students here has<br />\nnever' been one of trust.

Certainly about the discontent with and w ithin our institutions of higher learning, and they<br />\nwill probably attribute it to the narrowness and<br />\ninappropriatness of universities' goals.<br />\nFor it is now clear that they are moving toward<br />\na single major objective--the production of technological knowledge and of technological researchers to produce more technological knowledge.<br />\nThe ethos of graduate schools has permeated<br />\nundergraduate schools, where students are judged on the basis of their promise as future researchers. In the prestigious professional schools,<br />\npractice is often viewed as inferior to research.<br />\nAnd in our graduate schools students are taught<br />\nto believe that they should engage only inthe narrow research activities for which they have been<br />\nspecifically trained.<br />\n<br />\nIntellectual Monism<br />\nThis primary purpose may not be appropriate<br />\nfor universities in our time. Even if it were, it<br />\nshould not become the only purpose, for the dangers inherent in intellectual monism are well<br />\ndocumented in human experience.<br />\nAt our level of affluence it is doubtful that technological progress will henceforth coincide with<br />\nhuman progress. Moreover, it is not certain that<br />\nwe can employ additional technological knowledge<br />\nto extricate ourselves from the problems that<br />\nprevious technology has created. Although there<br />\nare many areas of human agony that call for more<br />\neffective technological achievement, given the<br />\ncurrent conception of research it is possible that<br />\nwe are now spending too much money on it; scientists and their epigones, the social scientists, are<br />\n\"producing\" on the one hand technical information<br />\nthat is infinitely more hazardous than the problems it solves, and, on the other hand, oceans<br />\nand mountains of ambiguous data that are employed to give a pseudo-scientific warranty to preferences, biases, and lusts for social power. Nuclear<br />\nenergy, perhaps, the most trite example of the<br />\nfirst; another is that we may be on the urge of<br />\nlearning how to control the future development of<br />\nour species. As an example of the second kind of<br />\ninformation, we need only to look at the volume<br />\nand vacuity of scientific research on teacher<br />\neffectiveness.<br />\n<br />\nWalton<br />\n<br />\nAre we arguing for ignorance? And, are we despairing a social science of human behavior? To<br />\nthe first question, the reply is unequivocally in<br />\nthe negative. We are suggesting that the priorities of knowledge should be shifted. How much<br />\nmore important other kinds of knowledge will be<br />\nif and when we acquire the technical skill to control the genetic development of our species and/<br />\nor arrive at a significant science of human behavior.<br />\n<br />\nTo Poetry and Art<br />\nGiven, then, a technological system that exceeds<br />\nin many ways our needs, that has produced fearsome side effects, and the current lack of human<br />\nsatisfactions, the primary responsibility of universities should be shifted from science to values,<br />\nfrom the production of technical knowledge that to<br />\npoetry and art, from the norms of technical researchers to that of serious inquiries into morality<br />\nand meaning.<br />\nTechnological research must be continued, as<br />\nwell as a number of other intellectual activities,<br />\nfor it is not good for universities to indulge in<br />\nthe fanaticism of singleness of purpose. Observe<br />\nwhat the exaggerated emphasis on research has<br />\ndone to teaching; in many universities teaching is<br />\nimportant only if it can be subjected to research;<br />\nin others it is of interest only if it can be translated into technology. But it is possible that one<br />\nof the major intellectual contributions a university can make is to provide succeeding generations with humane scholars as their teachers.<br />\nThere may, then, be some truth to the explanation of student unrest that finds its cause in affluence. Students now know that they can overeat,<br />\noverlive, and overkill amidst the banalities and<br />\nabstractions that modern technology has provided.<br />\nAnd they can look forward to<br />\na ride to the moon<br />\nany Sunday afternoon,<br />\nwatching (via the screen) all the way<br />\nbirds,(Orioles) at play,<br />\nwhile polluting heaven.<br />\nEducation institutions that are intent on magnifying these superfluities may well indeed be<br />\nobsolete.<br />\nDr. John Walton is a professor of Education at Homewood<br />\n<br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nPEACE FAST<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nConcerning last week's Fast for Peace:I respect<br />\nSaga Bill's concern for starving Vietnamese children, but why can he not refund all freshmen their<br />\nmoney for each meal missed?

Yet the movement to alleviate<br />\ntension has attempted to get all parties<br />\ninvolved by a diversification of the demands presented. This is a mistake.The<br />\nstudents who want an abolition of all military recruitment and ROTC on the campus<br />\nmaintain that it is the primary issue and<br />\ngovernance is only secondary. This is<br />\nalso a mistake.<br />\nIf the strike is to be a strike supported<br />\nby a majority of the four thousand plus<br />\ngraduates and undergraduates attending<br />\nthis university, the issues must be clarified. Most of the students are aware of<br />\nthe critical need for a new governance<br />\nsystem and are also aware because of<br />\npast precedent that Dr. Gordon is quite<br />\nadept at giving the illusion of open chan-<br />\n<br />\nnels while he is in effect making all the<br />\ndecisions himself. The governance issue<br />\nis the most important issue we now have<br />\nbefore us. The students are getting actively involved as they have never done<br />\nbefore. We can not risk losing this valuable momentum by making the primary<br />\nissue an issue that is only receiving lukewarm support. Governance should and<br />\nMUST be primary. This is the only ay we<br />\ncan get the majority of students to support us.<br />\nIf the strike demands are met and a<br />\nUniversity Senate is created,the students<br />\nwould then have a place to bring their<br />\narguments as to why military recruiting<br />\nand ROTC should not be allowed on campus. If a Mr method of governance were<br />\nset up then these issues can be deliberated and a fair settlement can be<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe issue of military recruitment is<br />\na minor one. If the student strikers are<br />\nso opposed to the war machine they<br />\n<br />\nshould take the logical step of banning<br />\nall war-related recruitment from the<br />\ncampus. One can surely find things wrong<br />\nwith most of the corporations who recruit<br />\nhere. If your General Electrics did not<br />\nproduce jet engines for bombers and your<br />\nchemical companies did not produce<br />\nnapalm and gunpowder thenthe war machine would surely be put in a nonfunctional position. If these recruiters<br />\ndid not come onto the college campuses<br />\nit would be a lot harder for them to get<br />\npeople to do research in these areas for<br />\nthem. We must move toward the exclusion of all these recruiters from the<br />\ncampus if we are not to be hypocritical.<br />\nThe issue of ROTC on campus is essentially one where the strikers claim it<br />\nis a clear case of university complacency<br />\nand militarism. The ROTC program at<br />\nthis university is voluntary and not compulsory. Any student has a choice in the<br />\nmatter and is free to remain outside the<br />\nROTC program if he sees fit. If there<br />\n<br />\nwere no ROTC, then the military would<br />\nbe forced to draw solely on officers<br />\ntrained in the service academies. The<br />\nend result would be a military elite of<br />\nofficers indoctrinated in one way. There<br />\nis an advantage in having officers trained<br />\nin schools such as Johns Hopkins<br />\nwhere they receive exposure to many<br />\nliberal and redical ideas. The APL issue,<br />\non the other hand cannot be compromised,<br />\nit is logical to ask for the end of classified<br />\nresearch. The July 1971 date provides<br />\ntime for the university to find new nonmilitary research grants.<br />\nThe University Senate I propose would<br />\nprovide equal representation for the<br />\nfaculty, administration, graduates, and<br />\nundergraduates. Each person would have<br />\none vote and each group (Student Body,<br />\nGraduate Student Organization, Faculty<br />\nSenate, and Administration)would choose<br />\ntheir own representatives as they see fit..<br />\nI submit this is a logical proposal for the<br />\nconsideration of the parties involved.<br />\n<br />\n6:02 a.m. Westminster.<br />\n(A Poem)<br />\n<br />\nYou only go around once in life:<br />\nSo grab for all the gusto you can.<br />\nEven in the beer you drink.<br />\nWhy settle for less?<br />\nWhen you're out of Schlitz,<br />\nyou're out of beer.<br />\n<br />\n'Do you think anyone knows the shit<br />\nwe go through to put something like<br />\nthis out?' - Rohilich,<br />\n'Not unless they're done it.' - Tor<br />\nloss.

Last season, Johns Hopkins and the U.S.<br />\nMilitary Academy were national<br />\nco-champions, despite Hopkins'<br />\n14-11 triumph over the Cadets.<br />\nPre-season forecasters picked<br />\nArmy to be undisputed national<br />\nchamps this year. In the words<br />\nof Hopkins veteran coach Bob<br />\nScott, \"They've lived up to the<br />\ncoaches' expectations of being<br />\nthe number one college team.\"<br />\nA tattered Blue Jay ten, following their humiliating defeat by<br />\nVirginia, have their sights set on<br />\nan upset, but this is way off alignment with reality.<br />\nThe Miller Division coaches'<br />\nbuild-up of Army has portrayed<br />\nthe Cadets as veritable supermen. Yet, the Cadets' \"unbeatable\" tag had to be dropped after<br />\nthe Long Island Lacrosse Club,<br />\nlast year's club champions,doused Army's chances for a perfect<br />\nseason, 12-8. The game, played<br />\non the Island, was held at night.<br />\nUnused to night lacrosse, the<br />\nBlack Knights were affected.<br />\nArmy with a 4-1 record is undefeated in college play.<br />\n<br />\nCountry's Best Attack<br />\nCoach Scott refers to Army's<br />\nattack as \"the best in the coun-<br />\n<br />\ntry\". Senior and 1969 first team<br />\nall-American<br />\nPete Cramblet<br />\n(Jersey No. 2) leads the attack<br />\nwith 15 goals and 9 assists. Cramblet is joined by classmate, Marty<br />\nKnorr (no. 16), whose twelve<br />\ngoals is second only to Cramblet. Knorr has 4 assists. Both<br />\nattackmen have played together<br />\nfor at least 7 years. They played<br />\ntheir high school lacrosse at<br />\nHuntington on the Island.<br />\nAnother Long Island product,<br />\nTom Cafaro (no. 14), rounds out<br />\nthe starting attack unit. The<br />\nslick-shooting Cafaro is a junior<br />\nand was a second team all-American as a sophomore. He missed<br />\nthe Princeton game, but still<br />\nhas 11 goals and 7 assists to his<br />\ncredit.<br />\nCramblet has to be the key to<br />\nthis high scoring attack. Last<br />\nyear against the Jays, he had 6<br />\ngoals. He matched this number<br />\nagainst Princeton this year in<br />\nhis team's 12-6 win. In 1969, the<br />\nsix - foot 175 - pound attackman<br />\nscored 4 or more goals in 5<br />\ngames. All told in 1969,this awesome trio had 66 goals and 44<br />\nassists. With such impressive<br />\nstats, the word perhaps \"triumvirate\" better typifies Army's<br />\nformidable attack.<br />\n<br />\nPunch<br />\nWest Point's scoring punch is<br />\nmostly in their attack, but senior midfielder Ed Hirsch(no.21),<br />\nhas 9 goals and 3 assists in<br />\nArmy's five games.

Following approval of the agreement<br />\nby President Gordon the Strike<br />\nCommittee voted overwhelmingly<br />\nto suspend the strike and continue<br />\nnegotiations on the other demands.<br />\nNegotiations were highly emotional. At one point early in the<br />\ntalks, Dr. Richard Pfeffer, another<br />\nStrike Committee negotiator, told<br />\nadministrators, \"I think you guys<br />\nare not here to negotiate,\" and<br />\nstomped out. Pfeffer's outburst<br />\nhad a sobering effect on the meeting. \"Several people either broke<br />\ndown or were in tears,\" stated<br />\nDr. Pepper. Upon Pfeffer's return,<br />\nthe meeting started moving.<br />\nStrike Committee negotiator<br />\nDr. Steven Pepper called the settlement \"better than anybody expected.\"<br />\nRecruiting Suspended<br />\nThe substance of the agreement<br />\nhas military recruiting suspended<br />\non the Homewood Campus unless<br />\nten percent of the student body<br />\npetitions for such recruitment be.fore May 1. In that case, an all-student referendum will be held on<br />\nthe matter. Any referendum must<br />\nbe held before May l or military<br />\nrecruiting will be permanently banned.<br />\nThe outcome of the referendum<br />\nwould be decided by a majority of<br />\nthose voting. The faculty would<br />\nnot vote unless the General Assembly decided to take up the issue.<br />\nIf that happened, the faculty vote<br />\nwould be added to the referendum<br />\nresults on a one-man, one-vote basis. The faculty cannot initiate the<br />\ncall for the referendum, and, in<br />\nany case, the vote wuold be binding.<br />\nIn further agreements, Benton<br />\nstated that a student-faculty committee would be drawn up to work<br />\nover the summer on a .r:\u20222w governance system to be instituted in<br />\nthe fall. Negotiations on the makeUP of the committee will be held<br />\nnext week.<br />\nThe Strike Committee is calling<br />\nfor a noon rally today in commemoration of the Vietnamese<br />\ndead, which they describe as \"a<br />\nre-dedication to the struggle.\"<br />\nThey also have called a meeting to<br />\nPlan next week's negotiations.<br />\npie by Weingarten<br /><br />\nStrikers hope to have the issues of<br />\nAPL and ROTC included in these<br />\ndiscussions. Benton gave a verbal<br />\ncommittment that the Academic<br />\nCouncil would act quickly on the<br />\nrecommendations of the Committee on Student Relations concerning ROTC. (See page 3.) Strikers<br />\ndropped the demand calling for an<br />\ninvestigation of Gordon's actions<br />\nduring the past few days.<br />\nEmotion-Filled<br />\nThe final agreement was ironed<br />\nout in a three-hour emotion-filled session last night, the second<br />\nsuch session in as many days. The<br />\nstrikers took the results back to a<br />\nLevering Hall Strike Committee<br />\nmeeting which had originally been<br />\ncalled to plan tactics for today.<br />\nApplause broke out after the agreement was announced.<br />\nBenton and Bevan took the results to Gordon's house where he<br />\napproved them. When his approval<br />\nwas relayed to the Levering meeting the strikers broke out in a chorus of wild applause, added their<br />\naffirmative vote and suspended<br />\nFriday's strike.<br />\nFollowing Wednesday's bargaining session, there remained disagreement Over the question of military recruiting. Strikers wanted<br />\nrecruiting banned as a University<br />\npolicy. They maintained that only<br />\na new governance system should<br />\nhave the power to alter the policy;<br />\nand then only if it chose to discuss<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nBenton and Bevan had proposed<br />\nthat the recruiting be suspended<br />\nfor a specified period at which<br />\ntime new governing body would<br />\ndecide the question.<br />\nThe Strike Committee negotiating team consisted of Drs.

Picket<br />\nlines were set up at all University<br />\nentrances. Four picketers reported<br />\nthat they were struck by vehicles<br />\ndriving through the lines. including<br />\nLarry Spetka, who said he was hit<br />\nby a car driven by Stephen Nem-<br /><br />\nphes, Chief University Accountant.<br />\nNemphes drove through the picket<br />\nline after the strikers refused to allow him to enter the campus without taking a leaflet.

Any hope<br />\nof success which he entertained<br />\nhe based on the fact that \"We're<br />\nwithin the law and are just asking<br />\nfor rights.\"<br />\nSome Reasons<br />\nThe strike committee explained their reason for the injunction as, \"in the past, this University has subtly and not-so-subtly<br />\ntampered with the rights of dis<br />\ntampered with the rights of dissent and free expression on campus.\" Murphy added that the<br />\nstrikers had \"reason to believe<br /><br />\n...tenure nas been tampered with.\"<br />\nHe further charged the University<br />\nwith \"an old concept of what a<br />\nstudent should be, a slave or a<br />\nvassal.\"<br />\nMurphy also cast legal doubts<br />\non the recently formulated student<br />\ndiscipline code, pointing out that<br />\nstudents have certain constitutional rights which may not be respected by the Code, such as the<br />\nright of the accused to inspect<br />\nany evidence to be used against<br />\nhim, to be informed of the witnesses against him and any written<br />\ndepositions they may have made,<br />\nand to be bound by published<br />\nrules which are not so vague as to<br />\nbe limiting to First Amendment<br />\nrights.<br />\nTo Insure<br />\nThe injunction would attempt to insure these and various<br />\nother legal rights to students, as<br />\nwell as defining any limitations<br />\nof . free political expression to<br />\ncases of clear and present danger<br />\nof serious violations of law.<br />\nMurphy elaborated that the<br />\ninjunction would seek to prohibit<br />\nloss of tenure or other sorts of<br />\nintimidation by the University towards its professors or employees<br />\nas a result of participation in demonstrations or political activities.<br />\nThe injunction, according to<br />\nMurphy, would \"make it possible<br />\nfor students to voice their dissent.\" Thus it would seek to bar<br />\nthe use of offensive weapons, such<br />\nas nightsticks, MACE, etc., on<br />\ncampus by police, or any other<br />\ngroup.<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nApril 24,1970<br /><br />\nBrazilian Accuses Gordon of Supporting Coup<br />\nBy MARC KRIZACK<br />\nSpeaking at Shriver Hall Wednesday afternoon, Marcio Alves,<br />\nCongressman - in - exile from<br />\nBrazil, accused Dr. Lincoln Gordon, former U.S. Ambassador to<br />\nBrazil, of full knowledge and tacit<br />\nsupport of the military coup which<br />\noverthrew the constitutional government of Brazil in 1964.<br />\nIn describing Gordon's role in<br />\nthe military coup, Alves called<br />\nhim, \"one of the midwives of this<br />\nregime.\" The 1964 coup, disguised as reformed constitutional<br />\nlaw, \"came as no surprise to the<br />\nUnited States,\" said Alves. \"In<br />\nfact,\" continued Alves,\"the coup<br />\nwas helped by the United States<br />\nembassy\"<br />\nMarcio Alves was originally<br />\nbrought to Hopkins by Manuel<br />\nRodriguez to debate Dr. Gordon<br />\nover the issue of the 1964 coup.<br />\nRodriguez pointed out that in<br />\nGordon's address to the crowd<br />\ngathered<br />\naround<br />\nHomewood<br />\nHouse over the weekend, he stated that he would debate about<br />\nBrazil with \"anyone, anytime.\"<br />\nIn his written statement, sent to<br />\nfaculty and students, concerning<br />\nthis week's anti-military protests<br />\non campus, Gordon specifically<br />\nstated that he had kept his calendar open for April 22 -- if anyone wanted to meet with him to<br />\ndiscuss the issues in which this<br />\ncampus is currently embroiled.<br />\nYet, according to Rodriguez<br />\nDr. Gordon had left for a meeting of the American Association<br /><br />\nof Universities in Washington<br />\nWednesday morning.

Faculty<br />\nmembers,<br />\ntenured and non-tenured, and students,<br />\ngraduates and undergraduates, were all<br />\nallowed to express their views.<br />\nAccording to the report, the Committee on Undergraduate Education is to<br />\nreview and then recommend resolution<br />\nof grievances about education. Such<br />\ntopics as admissions, curriculum, improved teaching, and a meaningful mini-<br /><br />\nmester are to be included in the investigation. Other topics are not excluded,<br />\nhowever, and no time limit for reporting the results has been set.<br />\nPolicy-Making<br />\nThe new governance task force will<br />\ndeal with the recommendations in terms<br />\nof policy making in the Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. The report stated that<br />\nthe issues involved are; provisionwithin the present framework for better<br />\ncommunication and representation on<br />\nall levels for undergraduates graduates,<br />\nand non-tenured faculty; clarification<br />\nof the lines of authority; and rationalization of the committee structure.<br />\nThe committee recommend that membership of a special committee on undergraduate educt<br />\ngraduate education consist of the Provost, the Associate Dean of Undergrad- .<br /><br />\nuate Studies, two tenured and two nontenured faculty, two undergraduates,and<br />\none graduate student. The task force<br />\nis to consist of the Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences, one tenured and one nontenured faculty, one graduate student<br />\nand one undergraduate.<br />\nThis group<br />\nshould have its report for the General<br />\nAssembly and the Academic Council by<br />\nDecember 1, 1970.<br />\nThe procedure for the canvass of the<br />\ncommunity varied from group to group.<br />\nThe faculty were interviewed; views of<br />\nadministrative committees with studentfaculty membership were solicited (only<br />\n3 of 12 replied); students attended open<br />\nforums and took part in polls.<br />\nDecisive Voice<br />\nForty-seven per cent of the 531 undergraduates polled expressed dissatisfaci<br /><br />\n4 crowd offrom 200 to 500 persons gathered in front of Homewood House for a rally, Wednesday, the first day of the strike.<br /><br />\nGovernance<br />\nUnsettled<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n. 4440<br />\nAlma,<br /><br />\nStrikers in front of Homewood House which<br />\nwas hit by a bomb scare late Wednesday night.<br /><br />\n(continued from page I)<br />\nPickets manned the lines in scant numbers on Wednesday, but were out in force<br />\nThursday morning, stopping most people<br />\nfrom coming on campus. Besides Spetka,<br />\nDavid Charry and John Moriarty reported<br />\nbeing struck by vehicles moving through<br />\nthe lines. Dr Richard Pfeffer claimed that<br />\nhe was forced to jump out of the way<br />\nof the path of a car driven by Dr. Ferdinand Hamburger, Director of the Centennial Planning Committee. Many students<br />\nreported similar near-misses. Because<br />\nof the danger of further incidents, picket lines were called in at the beginning<br />\nof the Strike Committee's meeting at 3<br />\np.m.<br />\nOther Thursday actions included class<br />\ndisruption. Strikers in conjunction with<br />\nEnvironmental Teach-In organizers entered class meetings and asked for them<br />\nto discuss the strike issues. Participants<br />\nreported moderate success.<br /><br />\nEnd of ROTC Predicted<br />\nThe end of ROTC at Hopkins has been<br />\npredicted by the Committee on Student<br />\nRelations, a subcommittee of the Academic Council chaired by Edwin S. Mills,<br />\nProfessor of Political Economy.<br />\nIn the committee report issued yesterdaY but dated April 17, the committee<br />\nannounced that it was \"ursanknous in<br />\nbelieving that the present status of ROTC<br />\nat Johns Hopkins is unsatisfactory\" and<br />\nthat \"major changes should be made.\"<br />\nA majority of the committee,accrilinng<br />\nto the report, \"believes that FliOTC is inconsistent with the basic goals of the<br />\nUniversity and that ROTC should be ended<br />\nas soon as possible, consistent with orderly termination of the contract.\"<br />\nThe minority viewpoint was that ROTC<br />\nshould be treated as an extracurricular<br />\nactivity, thus witholding departmental<br /><br />\nstatus from ROTC and academic status from its instructors. If a new contract cannot be negotiated, \"the minority urges that ROTC be terminated,\"<br />\nthe report stated.<br />\nThe statement concluded that, \"Although the minority urges the University<br />\nto make a serious attempt to renegotiate the contract, it is not sanguine that<br />\na satisfactory contract is possible.\"<br />\nMills explained that other colleges<br />\nwhich have attempted to relegate ROTC<br />\nto an extracurricular activity have been<br />\nunable to do so to the satisfaction of the<br />\narmed forces and have been forced to<br />\nterminate their contracts.<br />\nHe also claimed that the committee<br />\nwas \"absolutely uninfluenced by the<br />\nevents of the past few days, and had<br />\nreached its decision over a week ago.\"<br /><br />\npix by Weingarten<br /><br />\ntion with governance; while 13 per cent<br />\nexpressed satisfaction with the status<br />\nquo. A majority of these students want<br />\na decisive voice in extra-curricular<br />\nactivities, their own conduct, and course<br />\nofferings. They want to be consulted on<br />\nall other academic affairs of the University.<br />\nMost faculty interviews gave support<br />\nto the undergraduates' desires. However, the faculty wished to maintain its<br />\nsuperiority over curriculum. A sizeable<br />\nminority of the undergraduates, 21 per<br />\ncent, were willing to devote at least five<br />\nhou'rs per week or inure to governance.<br />\nThe canvass found that graduate students agree with the rest of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity that the main problem concerns undergraduates. Their complaints<br />\ndeal with a larger formal role in their<br />\ntraditional role of consultation for academic affairs on the departmental level.<br />\nThey also express a desire for a larger<br />\nsay in University-wide decisions due to<br />\ndiscontent with the committee structure.<br />\nThe tenured faculty expressed dissatisfaction especially about the lines of<br />\nauthority, particularly in committees.<br />\nThey also asserted that the academic<br />\ncouncil was overworked and that the<br />\npower of the administration for administrative appointments and research<br />\ngrants was not monitored by faculty.<br />\nJunior faculty felt that teaching and<br />\nresearch were hindered by the quantitative requirements of publication. Some<br />\nof these faculty who are primarily involved in departmental affairs, want a formal channel in decisions for the whole<br />\nU niversity.<br />\nAdministrators were dissatisfied with<br />\ntheir responsibility in relationwith their<br />\npower. Those polled Telt excessively<br />\ninvolved with the details of student relations and preempted by special interest<br />\ngroups of faculty and students. A strain<br />\nin the University tradition of faculty<br />\nself-government has thus resulted.<br /><br />\nSAC Again Refuses<br />\nReferendum Request<br />\nBy ibNDY GREEN<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee voted<br />\ndown for the second time in three dayia<br />\nproposal that it hold a referendum on<br />\nmilitary recruiting on campus.<br />\nSAC Chairman Dr. John White and the<br />\nother committee members who had resigned after a controversial Monday night<br />\nmeeting tentatively decided to remain on<br />\nthe committee.<br />\nThe vote on military recruiting came<br />\nafter two hours of often angry debate<br />\nWednesday afternoon. SAC Chairman<br />\nDr. John White proposed the motion after<br />\nAlex Sotir, a committee member, petitioned the SAC to allow military recruiters on campus. In responding to<br />\nSotir's petition, the SAC acted on its own<br />\nrecommendation regarding recruitment.<br />\nPassed Monday night, that recommendation proposed that no recruiters<br />\nbe allowed on campus until someone presented a petition requesting such recruiting. That recommendation was passed<br />\nafter an initial proposal to conduct a referendum was defeated.<br />\nPresident Lincoln Gordon has not<br />\nresponded publicly to the SAC's recommendation. Dr. White, however,stated at<br />\nthe Wednesday meeting that Gordon had<br />\ntold him in private that the proposalwas<br />\nunacceptable to him.<br />\nArguing consistently in favor of a referendum, White pointed out that Gordon<br />\nhas previously declared that be would<br />\naccept the SAC's inierpretabon of the<br />\nresults of such a poll as binding.<br />\nStating that \"it is pointkess for us to<br />\nact upon a policy that has not yet been<br />\nmade policy,\" Dr. Jam S. Mann another<br />\nSAC member,alleged that tne referendum<br />\nmotion was out of order. Mann termed<br />\nGordon's failure to acknowledge the<br />\nCommittee's recommendation \"an insult.\" He then moved that hearings be<br />\nheld by the SAC onthe subject of recruit-<br /><br />\nment but that a decision be delayed until<br />\na new university governance system is<br />\ninstituted. The motion was never voted<br />\nupon.<br />\nWhite alleged that the SAC would be<br />\n\"clogging the channels of democracy\" if<br />\nit refused to conduct a referendum. The<br />\nreferendum would also set a precedent,<br />\nclaimed White, in deciding major campus issues in a democratic fashion.<br />\nWhen it was finally brought to a vote,<br />\nthe referendum motion w as defeated, 5-4.<br />\nPrior to the debate over the referendum, Mann announced that he would<br />\ncirculate a letter in rebuttal to Dr.<br />\nWhite's letter of resignation circulated<br />\nTuesday. White's letter censured the SAC<br />\nfor its original refusal to conduct a referendum. Mann's letter states that the<br />\nCommittee was completely in order in<br />\nmoving to ban recruiters after a democratically conducted meeting.<br />\nAlso signing the letter that Mann had<br />\npresented are committee members Chris<br />\nOhly, John Guess,Robert Cotter,Richard<br />\nConvisor, and Stuart Seidel. Convisor is<br />\nsigning the letter although he did not<br />\nattend the Monday night meeting because<br />\nhe claims to be \"familiar enough\" with<br />\nthe facts of the meeting and in support<br />\nof the spirit of the letter.<br />\nDr. White, who had submitted his resignation to Dean Allyn Kimball on Tuesday, announced that be had decided at<br />\nKimball's request to remain as chairman.<br />\nIt was then decided that the resignations<br />\nof weer&amp;I other cumin Him* members in-c.leding Mapes had not been tendered<br />\nformally, and were not accepted. Tbe<br />\nSAC therefore remains latact.<br />\nThe resignations of Seidel and Ohly<br />\nhave to be considered by the Student<br />\nCouncil and Cotter's has to be heard<br />\nby the Graduate Student Organization.<br />\nMann's resignation has to be considered<br />\nby Dean Kimball.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nApril 24, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nVolpe: The Auto Is Deadly<br />\nBy RALPH MOLLER<br />\nVolpe, Secretary of<br />\nJohn<br />\nTransportation, kicked off the<br />\nHopkins Environmental Teachin Wednesday night with an address in which he discussed transportation and the environment.<br />\nAmong the things he covered<br />\nwere land-use planning, mass<br />\ntransit and the role of government in transportation and the<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nVolpe explained that a lot of<br />\nstructures have been designed<br />\nwithout regard to their effects<br />\non their surroundings.

Certainly about the discontent with and w ithin our institutions of higher learning, and they<br />\nwill probably attribute it to the narrowness and<br />\ninappropriatness of universities' goals.<br />\nFor it is now clear that they are moving toward<br />\na single major objective--the production of technological knowledge and of technological researchers to produce more technological knowledge.<br />\nThe ethos of graduate schools has permeated<br />\nundergraduate schools, where students are judged on the basis of their promise as future researchers. In the prestigious professional schools,<br />\npractice is often viewed as inferior to research.<br />\nAnd in our graduate schools students are taught<br />\nto believe that they should engage only inthe narrow research activities for which they have been<br />\nspecifically trained.<br /><br />\nIntellectual Monism<br />\nThis primary purpose may not be appropriate<br />\nfor universities in our time. Even if it were, it<br />\nshould not become the only purpose, for the dangers inherent in intellectual monism are well<br />\ndocumented in human experience.<br />\nAt our level of affluence it is doubtful that technological progress will henceforth coincide with<br />\nhuman progress. Moreover, it is not certain that<br />\nwe can employ additional technological knowledge<br />\nto extricate ourselves from the problems that<br />\nprevious technology has created. Although there<br />\nare many areas of human agony that call for more<br />\neffective technological achievement, given the<br />\ncurrent conception of research it is possible that<br />\nwe are now spending too much money on it; scientists and their epigones, the social scientists, are<br />\n\"producing\" on the one hand technical information<br />\nthat is infinitely more hazardous than the problems it solves, and, on the other hand, oceans<br />\nand mountains of ambiguous data that are employed to give a pseudo-scientific warranty to preferences, biases, and lusts for social power. Nuclear<br />\nenergy, perhaps, the most trite example of the<br />\nfirst; another is that we may be on the urge of<br />\nlearning how to control the future development of<br />\nour species. As an example of the second kind of<br />\ninformation, we need only to look at the volume<br />\nand vacuity of scientific research on teacher<br />\neffectiveness.<br /><br />\nWalton<br /><br />\nAre we arguing for ignorance? And, are we despairing a social science of human behavior? To<br />\nthe first question, the reply is unequivocally in<br />\nthe negative. We are suggesting that the priorities of knowledge should be shifted. How much<br />\nmore important other kinds of knowledge will be<br />\nif and when we acquire the technical skill to control the genetic development of our species and/<br />\nor arrive at a significant science of human behavior.<br /><br />\nTo Poetry and Art<br />\nGiven, then, a technological system that exceeds<br />\nin many ways our needs, that has produced fearsome side effects, and the current lack of human<br />\nsatisfactions, the primary responsibility of universities should be shifted from science to values,<br />\nfrom the production of technical knowledge that to<br />\npoetry and art, from the norms of technical researchers to that of serious inquiries into morality<br />\nand meaning.<br />\nTechnological research must be continued, as<br />\nwell as a number of other intellectual activities,<br />\nfor it is not good for universities to indulge in<br />\nthe fanaticism of singleness of purpose. Observe<br />\nwhat the exaggerated emphasis on research has<br />\ndone to teaching; in many universities teaching is<br />\nimportant only if it can be subjected to research;<br />\nin others it is of interest only if it can be translated into technology. But it is possible that one<br />\nof the major intellectual contributions a university can make is to provide succeeding generations with humane scholars as their teachers.<br />\nThere may, then, be some truth to the explanation of student unrest that finds its cause in affluence. Students now know that they can overeat,<br />\noverlive, and overkill amidst the banalities and<br />\nabstractions that modern technology has provided.<br />\nAnd they can look forward to<br />\na ride to the moon<br />\nany Sunday afternoon,<br />\nwatching (via the screen) all the way<br />\nbirds,(Orioles) at play,<br />\nwhile polluting heaven.<br />\nEducation institutions that are intent on magnifying these superfluities may well indeed be<br />\nobsolete.<br />\nDr. John Walton is a professor of Education at Homewood<br /><br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nPEACE FAST<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nConcerning last week's Fast for Peace:I respect<br />\nSaga Bill's concern for starving Vietnamese children, but why can he not refund all freshmen their<br />\nmoney for each meal missed?

Yet the movement to alleviate<br />\ntension has attempted to get all parties<br />\ninvolved by a diversification of the demands presented. This is a mistake.The<br />\nstudents who want an abolition of all military recruitment and ROTC on the campus<br />\nmaintain that it is the primary issue and<br />\ngovernance is only secondary. This is<br />\nalso a mistake.<br />\nIf the strike is to be a strike supported<br />\nby a majority of the four thousand plus<br />\ngraduates and undergraduates attending<br />\nthis university, the issues must be clarified. Most of the students are aware of<br />\nthe critical need for a new governance<br />\nsystem and are also aware because of<br />\npast precedent that Dr. Gordon is quite<br />\nadept at giving the illusion of open chan-<br /><br />\nnels while he is in effect making all the<br />\ndecisions himself. The governance issue<br />\nis the most important issue we now have<br />\nbefore us. The students are getting actively involved as they have never done<br />\nbefore. We can not risk losing this valuable momentum by making the primary<br />\nissue an issue that is only receiving lukewarm support. Governance should and<br />\nMUST be primary. This is the only ay we<br />\ncan get the majority of students to support us.<br />\nIf the strike demands are met and a<br />\nUniversity Senate is created,the students<br />\nwould then have a place to bring their<br />\narguments as to why military recruiting<br />\nand ROTC should not be allowed on campus. If a Mr method of governance were<br />\nset up then these issues can be deliberated and a fair settlement can be<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe issue of military recruitment is<br />\na minor one. If the student strikers are<br />\nso opposed to the war machine they<br /><br />\nshould take the logical step of banning<br />\nall war-related recruitment from the<br />\ncampus. One can surely find things wrong<br />\nwith most of the corporations who recruit<br />\nhere. If your General Electrics did not<br />\nproduce jet engines for bombers and your<br />\nchemical companies did not produce<br />\nnapalm and gunpowder thenthe war machine would surely be put in a nonfunctional position. If these recruiters<br />\ndid not come onto the college campuses<br />\nit would be a lot harder for them to get<br />\npeople to do research in these areas for<br />\nthem. We must move toward the exclusion of all these recruiters from the<br />\ncampus if we are not to be hypocritical.<br />\nThe issue of ROTC on campus is essentially one where the strikers claim it<br />\nis a clear case of university complacency<br />\nand militarism. The ROTC program at<br />\nthis university is voluntary and not compulsory. Any student has a choice in the<br />\nmatter and is free to remain outside the<br />\nROTC program if he sees fit. If there<br /><br />\nwere no ROTC, then the military would<br />\nbe forced to draw solely on officers<br />\ntrained in the service academies. The<br />\nend result would be a military elite of<br />\nofficers indoctrinated in one way. There<br />\nis an advantage in having officers trained<br />\nin schools such as Johns Hopkins<br />\nwhere they receive exposure to many<br />\nliberal and redical ideas. The APL issue,<br />\non the other hand cannot be compromised,<br />\nit is logical to ask for the end of classified<br />\nresearch. The July 1971 date provides<br />\ntime for the university to find new nonmilitary research grants.<br />\nThe University Senate I propose would<br />\nprovide equal representation for the<br />\nfaculty, administration, graduates, and<br />\nundergraduates. Each person would have<br />\none vote and each group (Student Body,<br />\nGraduate Student Organization, Faculty<br />\nSenate, and Administration)would choose<br />\ntheir own representatives as they see fit..<br />\nI submit this is a logical proposal for the<br />\nconsideration of the parties involved.<br /><br />\n6:02 a.m. Westminster.<br />\n(A Poem)<br /><br />\nYou only go around once in life:<br />\nSo grab for all the gusto you can.<br />\nEven in the beer you drink.<br />\nWhy settle for less?<br />\nWhen you're out of Schlitz,<br />\nyou're out of beer.<br /><br />\n'Do you think anyone knows the shit<br />\nwe go through to put something like<br />\nthis out?' - Rohilich,<br />\n'Not unless they're done it.' - Tor<br />\nloss.

Last season, Johns Hopkins and the U.S.<br />\nMilitary Academy were national<br />\nco-champions, despite Hopkins'<br />\n14-11 triumph over the Cadets.<br />\nPre-season forecasters picked<br />\nArmy to be undisputed national<br />\nchamps this year. In the words<br />\nof Hopkins veteran coach Bob<br />\nScott, \"They've lived up to the<br />\ncoaches' expectations of being<br />\nthe number one college team.\"<br />\nA tattered Blue Jay ten, following their humiliating defeat by<br />\nVirginia, have their sights set on<br />\nan upset, but this is way off alignment with reality.<br />\nThe Miller Division coaches'<br />\nbuild-up of Army has portrayed<br />\nthe Cadets as veritable supermen. Yet, the Cadets' \"unbeatable\" tag had to be dropped after<br />\nthe Long Island Lacrosse Club,<br />\nlast year's club champions,doused Army's chances for a perfect<br />\nseason, 12-8. The game, played<br />\non the Island, was held at night.<br />\nUnused to night lacrosse, the<br />\nBlack Knights were affected.<br />\nArmy with a 4-1 record is undefeated in college play.<br /><br />\nCountry's Best Attack<br />\nCoach Scott refers to Army's<br />\nattack as \"the best in the coun-<br /><br />\ntry\". Senior and 1969 first team<br />\nall-American<br />\nPete Cramblet<br />\n(Jersey No. 2) leads the attack<br />\nwith 15 goals and 9 assists. Cramblet is joined by classmate, Marty<br />\nKnorr (no. 16), whose twelve<br />\ngoals is second only to Cramblet. Knorr has 4 assists. Both<br />\nattackmen have played together<br />\nfor at least 7 years. They played<br />\ntheir high school lacrosse at<br />\nHuntington on the Island.<br />\nAnother Long Island product,<br />\nTom Cafaro (no. 14), rounds out<br />\nthe starting attack unit. The<br />\nslick-shooting Cafaro is a junior<br />\nand was a second team all-American as a sophomore. He missed<br />\nthe Princeton game, but still<br />\nhas 11 goals and 7 assists to his<br />\ncredit.<br />\nCramblet has to be the key to<br />\nthis high scoring attack.
