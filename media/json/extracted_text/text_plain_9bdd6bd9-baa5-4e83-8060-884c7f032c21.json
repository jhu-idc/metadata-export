A<br />\ndisarmament conference, Arnold Toynbee, Nina Simone,<br />\nClarence Mitchell, and the various other events included<br />\ntherein roused this campus from its semester-long lethargy<br />\nand gave undergraduates an indication of what they've<br />\nbeen missing.<br />\nThe purpose of all these activities was to remind<br />\nHopkins students of the need for brotherhood among men<br />\nduring these troubled times. We hear about it all the<br />\ntime, read about it. Seldom do we think about it, and<br />\neven less, practice it.<br />\nBut college students like to consider themselves the<br />\nepitome of \"thinking men.\" If this be so, then it should<br />\nbe self-evident that they would constantly reappraise and<br />\nre-examine the value-systems by which they live.<br />\nCharacter growth is an essential of any sound education. Even Hopkins holds it as one of its aims (see catalog, p. 12). The truly educated man should be prepared<br />\nto contribute to society's moral as well as to its material<br />\nadvancement. But if he thinks only of the differences<br />\nbetween himself and others, or sits back while others<br />\nderogate a man for his color or his religion he is offering<br />\nevidence that his education hasn't even begun.<br />\nThe News-Letter offers congratulations to all concerned for a magnificent Brotherhood Week.

The unjustness of<br />\nthis ruling is clearly seen in its<br />\nretroactive nature. . Obviously,<br />\nthe unlimited cut system was being abused, and the German Department feels that, in abolishing it, it is doing the only possible thing to continue a sound<br />\neducational program. There must<br />\nhave been a reason for the students' abuse of our cutting rules.<br />\nThe intellectual calibre of the<br />\nstudent body that the University<br />\naccepts certainly hasn't gone<br />\ndown, but rather, has improved<br />\nin the past years. If the students<br />\nare more intelligent and have<br />\nfound it necessary to avoid attending German classes, maybe<br />\nthe fault lies in the department.<br />\nObviously the department has<br />\nnot realized that the students<br />\nnormally take at least four or<br />\nfive courses besides German.<br />\nWith assignments which are as<br />\nlong as those given in German<br />\ncourses, there doesn't seem to be<br />\ntime for everyone to prepare for<br />\nclasses, especially since the<br />\nclasses are held on three successive days.<br />\nThere can be only two Temedies for the educational problem<br />\nwhich the German Department<br />\nfaces, and one of them is not<br />\nforcing the students to come to<br />\nclass unprepared. The possible<br />\nsolutions can only be either, 1.<br />\nshorter assignments which can<br />\nbe done in a reasonable amount<br />\nof time and not usurping the<br />\nwhole evening before a class, or<br />\n2. a staggering of clases, every<br />\nother day, so that the assignments can be done without sacrificing preparation for other<br />\nclasses.<br />\nMike Hendricks<br />\n<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nfor<br />\nsystem<br />\ncourses. This decision is department policy and, according to<br />\none instructor, was not an idea<br />\noriginating with the graduate<br />\nstudents teaching the course, but<br />\nrather with the policy-making<br />\nprofessors of the department.<br />\nIt is somewhat ironic that this<br />\npolicy, violating the concept of<br />\nnon-obligatory class attendance<br />\nwhich the University advertises,<br />\nshould start in the German Department. The idea of class attendance being left to the students originated in the German<br />\nuniversities and it is upon this<br />\nEuropean system of education<br />\nthat this University was founded.<br />\nSupposedly, this system is part<br />\nof the Hopkins tradition. I believe that this violating of tradition marks the impending fall<br />\nof the mature, adult approach to<br />\neducation which Hopkins has al-<br />\n<br />\nlege freshman a \"general liberal<br />\narts program of high quality.\"<br />\nParts of this promise have not<br />\nbeen fulfilled, nor does there<br />\nseem any immediate prospect of<br />\ntheir being fulfilled.<br />\nAny \"general liberal arts program,\" especially one \"of high<br />\nquality,\" must include the study<br />\nof music theory and music history. There is no course of any<br />\nsuch kind offered at the present<br />\ntime. The explanation for this<br />\nlack is simple\u2014there is no music<br />\ndepartment. I think certainly<br />\nthat no one of the faculty or<br />\nadministration could or would<br />\ndeny the need for such a course;<br />\nif the aim of the University is<br />\ntruly to develop some degree of<br />\ncompleteness of personality, as<br />\nis so often claimed, at least a<br />\nbasic course in the music field<br />\nis a necessity. Certainly there is<br />\nenough interest among the un-<br />\n<br />\nNina Simone<br />\n<br />\nWhile this does hedge a bit in the realm of 'Sports,'<br />\nwe feel that since so much has been said, and done, by the<br />\nHopkins community in their apparent support for the<br />\nactivities sponsored by the Board of Intramural Athletics,<br />\nwe ought to examine what is really happening.<br />\nIt certainly appears that after more than a quarter<br />\nof a century, Hopkins is beginning to look at sports as a<br />\nrecreational activity, a way of breaking up the academic<br />\nroutine without detracting in any way from it.<br />\nWhile support for intermural athletics is waning,<br />\nsupport and participation in intramural athletics is waxing. Perhaps this is indicative of a new trend, or a<br />\npendulum swinging the other way. In any event it seems<br />\nto be upholding many people's ideas on the right role of<br />\nathletics at a University pledged towards the future of<br />\nGerman Class Cuts<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe would like to sound out the Hopkins community Today the German Depart- Liberal Education<br />\ntrend, and its direction.

May we suggest to Mr. Adams that the only<br />\nsolution to his woes is not rescheduling meetings, but<br />\nchanging a few faces.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\ndergraduate student body to<br />\nwarrant such a course.<br />\nNor, in fact, is this lack the<br />\nonly one which begins to question the whole truth of the \"general liberal arts program of high<br />\nquality\" statement. There is, for<br />\nexample, no drama department,<br />\nper se. This absence could be<br />\nalleviated, at least in part, by<br />\nthe separate departments' offering general courses, in translation, in drama, such as Dr. Harold Jantz's most excellent course<br />\nin Faust. A course in ancient<br />\nGreek tragedy was withdrawn<br />\nfrom the list of offered courses<br />\nin ti- e fall semester of 1959, and<br />\nno mention of it has been made<br />\nsince.<br />\nOne further basic need, long<br />\nand<br />\nequally long<br />\ndiscussed<br />\nignored as far as any action is<br />\nconcerned, is that of language<br />\nlaboratories. For many years<br />\ncommon equipment in most universities and even in many high<br />\nschools, language labs are virtually non-existent here. The<br />\nestablishment of such laboratories does indeed present many<br />\nproblems. Physical<br />\nfacilities,<br />\nfinancial output, etc. are all difficulties to be overcome, but the<br />\nrewards which would be reaped<br />\nby the undergraduate students<br />\nfar surpass the problems involved.<br />\nIn general, the liberal arts<br />\ncourses are marked by a singular lack of audio-visual aids,<br />\nwhose efficacy, while still questioned, is generally accepted. At<br />\nleast in part, the blame may be<br />\nlaid upon the individual instructors, who seem not to make use<br />\nof even the facilities that the<br />\nUniversity does have, such as<br />\nslide and movie projectors.<br />\nPossibly all these improvements will magically appear in<br />\nthe new library, the construction<br />\nof which is virtually mushrooming at the present moment. But<br />\nat any rate, the $5 million Ford<br />\nFoundation grant, given to Hopkins last year, and not earmarked for anything in particular, could certainly finance at<br />\nleast five or six music departments, a language lab, and a few<br />\ncourses in foreign and ancient<br />\ndrama.<br />\nSteve Salchenberger<br />\n<br />\nVVL Column<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nJust a word of commendation from an old News-Letter<br />\n\"ghost\" who still lurks around<br />\nthese hallowed halls.

On the other hand, Dr. Richard Cummerbund Twonkey, who, as the whole world knows, translated<br />\n\"The Pajama Game\" into Middle High Bactrian, contended<br />\nin his paper that the Old Wendish rune \"pt\" derives from the<br />\nLow Erse rune \"mf\" (pronounced \"gr\").<br />\nWell, sir the discussion grew so heated that Dr. Twonkey<br />\nfinally asked Dr. Spleen if he would like to step into the gymnasium and put on the gloves. Dr. Spleen accepted the challenge promptly, but the contest was never held because there<br />\nWere no gloves in the gymnasium that would fit Dr. Twonkey.<br />\n(The reader is doubtless finding this hard to believe as<br />\nEastern Reserve University is celebrated the length and breadth<br />\nof the land for the size of its glove collection. However, the<br />\nreader is asked to remember that Dr. Twonkey has extraordinarily small hands and arms. In fact, he spent the last<br />\nWar working in a small-arms plant, where lie received two<br />\nNavy \"E\" Awards and was widely hailed as a \"manly little<br />\n\u00a9 1901 Max Shulman<br />\nchap.\")<br />\n<br />\nrest of this little piece I seem<br />\nto be taking what appears to be<br />\nmerely a rather clever idea to its<br />\nlimits, I should urge that we discover the essence of the commonplace only in the extremes<br />\nto which it might be pushed.<br />\nNow I should like to carry out<br />\nthis argument a bit further. I<br />\nsubmit that old Walt, fat, hearty<br />\nand optimistic, is one of the most<br />\ndangerous writers who has ever<br />\npublished a line and that the<br />\nacademic embarrassment in the<br />\nface of Walt's largesse is symptomatic of a subconscious knowledge of this fact. I submit that<br />\nMr. Eliot's somewhat pathetic<br />\ninsistence that \"no verse is free\"<br />\nis nothing more than an hysterical defense against the anarchic tendencies of his own<br />\nform; the fact that his later<br />\nworks, as well as the poetry<br />\nof the current academic generation, are for the most part highly<br />\nformal, would seem to bear me<br />\nout. I presume that Mr. Eliot's<br />\nargument hinges on the so-called<br />\n\"ineluctable limits\" of<br />\nthe<br />\nhuman breath; but the natural<br />\nlaws of breathing and the unnatural laws of meter are two different things; and, of course,<br />\nman can alter his pace of breathing at will, so much so that the<br />\norganic laws of breath are ultimately as flexible and, who<br />\nknows, perhaps as suicidal\u2014as<br />\nthe laws that govern the gang<br />\nas apart from the community.<br />\nPerhaps this Faustian plunge,<br />\nredolent of Renaissance man, is<br />\nself-destructive at the root and<br />\nall roads in the modern world<br />\nlead to nada. But I digress, as<br />\nMax Schulman says. Another<br />\nAmerican poet, William Carlos<br />\nWilliams, has castigated imagism (a movement which made<br />\nfree verse one of its battlecries) for not having discovered<br />\n\"structural necessity.\" Significantly, Mr. Williams is not terribly fond of Whitman, and his<br />\nown later verse is composed in<br />\na relatively strict three-beat line.<br />\nBut, aside from Mr. Williams,<br />\nmost modern critics and poets\u2014<br />\nand this is a fascinating point-are notoriously unwilling to dis(Continued on Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nNORTH AMERICAN AVIATION, INC.*<br />\n<br />\nStudents' Shop in Levering<br />\nHall<br />\nManufactured by<br />\n<br />\nJ.

It can't be blamed on<br />\nthe players because these same hoopsters as Freshmen in<br />\nthe previous years lost a total of 4 games in 25 against<br />\nthe same competition.<br />\nThe real difference is that the hoopsters lacked the<br />\ndesire to win because it made very little difference to<br />\nanyone if they did. As the scores became worse and worse<br />\nthe team soon lost all interest in ,the garrie itself.

I therefore suggest that<br />\nsince the D.S.R.C. seems to have<br />\nno intention of submitting this<br />\nproposal to the dorms in a plebiscite, and I feel it is important<br />\nenough for such action, that the<br />\ndorm students should avail<br />\nthemselves of every opportunity<br />\nof protest by attending the<br />\nD.S.R.C. meetings and writing<br />\nthe News-Letter Fraternity men<br />\nshould also be aware that perhaps the fraternity houses may<br />\nalso soon need advisors, or are<br />\nthey called house-mothers?<br />\n<br />\n-NOTICESANNOUNCER<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from Page 7)<br />\ntwo year unbeaten record in dual<br />\nmeet competition, having scored<br />\nfifteen straight victories.<br />\nAgainst Catholic U. last Saturday the matmen compiled<br />\ntheir biggest point spread of the<br />\ncampaign.

A committee has been<br />\nappointed .to investigate the<br />\nmatter, which was proposed by<br />\nthe administration.<br />\nNot Proctors<br /><br />\nAs defined by Conrad, the<br />\nrole of the new Dorm residents<br />\nwill be to act as counselors and<br />\nadvisors to the Dorm students.<br />\nHe stated that they will not be<br />\n\"proctors\" in the accepted sense<br />\nof the word, but that their main<br />\nfunction will be an advisory one.<br />\nThese men are envisioned as<br />\nslightly older, more experienced<br />\npersons who will be in a position to help the students with<br />\ntheir problems as an academic<br />\nadvisor cannot.<br />\nThe reason given for the raise<br />\nin the number of dorm counselors from three to seven is<br />\nthat with more advisors there<br />\nis a greater likelihood that students of \u2022different temperaments<br />\nwill find someone of their own<br /><br />\n'al \u2022<br /><br />\nSIRON<br />\nC0111411 .11.ASI<br />\nLES BROWN<br />\nCALLON:41M<br />\n\"'CAB<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\nCAGAI<br />\nIONNI:- DORSEI<br />\nEDDI 1)\u20181141,<br />\njcE ELLING1(<br />\nBILL,\u2022 ul<br /><br />\nCOLLECTOR'S ITEM<br />\nA<br /><br />\nilk whom they feel that they can<br />\ntrust with their problems.

A<br />\ndisarmament conference, Arnold Toynbee, Nina Simone,<br />\nClarence Mitchell, and the various other events included<br />\ntherein roused this campus from its semester-long lethargy<br />\nand gave undergraduates an indication of what they've<br />\nbeen missing.<br />\nThe purpose of all these activities was to remind<br />\nHopkins students of the need for brotherhood among men<br />\nduring these troubled times. We hear about it all the<br />\ntime, read about it. Seldom do we think about it, and<br />\neven less, practice it.<br />\nBut college students like to consider themselves the<br />\nepitome of \"thinking men.\" If this be so, then it should<br />\nbe self-evident that they would constantly reappraise and<br />\nre-examine the value-systems by which they live.<br />\nCharacter growth is an essential of any sound education. Even Hopkins holds it as one of its aims (see catalog, p. 12). The truly educated man should be prepared<br />\nto contribute to society's moral as well as to its material<br />\nadvancement. But if he thinks only of the differences<br />\nbetween himself and others, or sits back while others<br />\nderogate a man for his color or his religion he is offering<br />\nevidence that his education hasn't even begun.<br />\nThe News-Letter offers congratulations to all concerned for a magnificent Brotherhood Week.

The unjustness of<br />\nthis ruling is clearly seen in its<br />\nretroactive nature. . Obviously,<br />\nthe unlimited cut system was being abused, and the German Department feels that, in abolishing it, it is doing the only possible thing to continue a sound<br />\neducational program. There must<br />\nhave been a reason for the students' abuse of our cutting rules.<br />\nThe intellectual calibre of the<br />\nstudent body that the University<br />\naccepts certainly hasn't gone<br />\ndown, but rather, has improved<br />\nin the past years. If the students<br />\nare more intelligent and have<br />\nfound it necessary to avoid attending German classes, maybe<br />\nthe fault lies in the department.<br />\nObviously the department has<br />\nnot realized that the students<br />\nnormally take at least four or<br />\nfive courses besides German.<br />\nWith assignments which are as<br />\nlong as those given in German<br />\ncourses, there doesn't seem to be<br />\ntime for everyone to prepare for<br />\nclasses, especially since the<br />\nclasses are held on three successive days.<br />\nThere can be only two Temedies for the educational problem<br />\nwhich the German Department<br />\nfaces, and one of them is not<br />\nforcing the students to come to<br />\nclass unprepared. The possible<br />\nsolutions can only be either, 1.<br />\nshorter assignments which can<br />\nbe done in a reasonable amount<br />\nof time and not usurping the<br />\nwhole evening before a class, or<br />\n2. a staggering of clases, every<br />\nother day, so that the assignments can be done without sacrificing preparation for other<br />\nclasses.<br />\nMike Hendricks<br /><br />\nundergraduate<br />\nfor<br />\nsystem<br />\ncourses. This decision is department policy and, according to<br />\none instructor, was not an idea<br />\noriginating with the graduate<br />\nstudents teaching the course, but<br />\nrather with the policy-making<br />\nprofessors of the department.<br />\nIt is somewhat ironic that this<br />\npolicy, violating the concept of<br />\nnon-obligatory class attendance<br />\nwhich the University advertises,<br />\nshould start in the German Department. The idea of class attendance being left to the students originated in the German<br />\nuniversities and it is upon this<br />\nEuropean system of education<br />\nthat this University was founded.<br />\nSupposedly, this system is part<br />\nof the Hopkins tradition. I believe that this violating of tradition marks the impending fall<br />\nof the mature, adult approach to<br />\neducation which Hopkins has al-<br /><br />\nlege freshman a \"general liberal<br />\narts program of high quality.\"<br />\nParts of this promise have not<br />\nbeen fulfilled, nor does there<br />\nseem any immediate prospect of<br />\ntheir being fulfilled.<br />\nAny \"general liberal arts program,\" especially one \"of high<br />\nquality,\" must include the study<br />\nof music theory and music history. There is no course of any<br />\nsuch kind offered at the present<br />\ntime. The explanation for this<br />\nlack is simple\u2014there is no music<br />\ndepartment. I think certainly<br />\nthat no one of the faculty or<br />\nadministration could or would<br />\ndeny the need for such a course;<br />\nif the aim of the University is<br />\ntruly to develop some degree of<br />\ncompleteness of personality, as<br />\nis so often claimed, at least a<br />\nbasic course in the music field<br />\nis a necessity. Certainly there is<br />\nenough interest among the un-<br /><br />\nNina Simone<br /><br />\nWhile this does hedge a bit in the realm of 'Sports,'<br />\nwe feel that since so much has been said, and done, by the<br />\nHopkins community in their apparent support for the<br />\nactivities sponsored by the Board of Intramural Athletics,<br />\nwe ought to examine what is really happening.<br />\nIt certainly appears that after more than a quarter<br />\nof a century, Hopkins is beginning to look at sports as a<br />\nrecreational activity, a way of breaking up the academic<br />\nroutine without detracting in any way from it.<br />\nWhile support for intermural athletics is waning,<br />\nsupport and participation in intramural athletics is waxing. Perhaps this is indicative of a new trend, or a<br />\npendulum swinging the other way.

This wasn't good enough for Mr. Adams, SC President, so he has rescheduled his meetings for 12 noon on<br />\nWednesdays. May we suggest to Mr. Adams that the only<br />\nsolution to his woes is not rescheduling meetings, but<br />\nchanging a few faces.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\ndergraduate student body to<br />\nwarrant such a course.<br />\nNor, in fact, is this lack the<br />\nonly one which begins to question the whole truth of the \"general liberal arts program of high<br />\nquality\" statement. There is, for<br />\nexample, no drama department,<br />\nper se. This absence could be<br />\nalleviated, at least in part, by<br />\nthe separate departments' offering general courses, in translation, in drama, such as Dr. Harold Jantz's most excellent course<br />\nin Faust. A course in ancient<br />\nGreek tragedy was withdrawn<br />\nfrom the list of offered courses<br />\nin ti- e fall semester of 1959, and<br />\nno mention of it has been made<br />\nsince.<br />\nOne further basic need, long<br />\nand<br />\nequally long<br />\ndiscussed<br />\nignored as far as any action is<br />\nconcerned, is that of language<br />\nlaboratories. For many years<br />\ncommon equipment in most universities and even in many high<br />\nschools, language labs are virtually non-existent here. The<br />\nestablishment of such laboratories does indeed present many<br />\nproblems. Physical<br />\nfacilities,<br />\nfinancial output, etc. are all difficulties to be overcome, but the<br />\nrewards which would be reaped<br />\nby the undergraduate students<br />\nfar surpass the problems involved.<br />\nIn general, the liberal arts<br />\ncourses are marked by a singular lack of audio-visual aids,<br />\nwhose efficacy, while still questioned, is generally accepted. At<br />\nleast in part, the blame may be<br />\nlaid upon the individual instructors, who seem not to make use<br />\nof even the facilities that the<br />\nUniversity does have, such as<br />\nslide and movie projectors.<br />\nPossibly all these improvements will magically appear in<br />\nthe new library, the construction<br />\nof which is virtually mushrooming at the present moment. But<br />\nat any rate, the $5 million Ford<br />\nFoundation grant, given to Hopkins last year, and not earmarked for anything in particular, could certainly finance at<br />\nleast five or six music departments, a language lab, and a few<br />\ncourses in foreign and ancient<br />\ndrama.<br />\nSteve Salchenberger<br /><br />\nVVL Column<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nJust a word of commendation from an old News-Letter<br />\n\"ghost\" who still lurks around<br />\nthese hallowed halls.

Among the many interesting mementos of his<br />\njourney is his own head, shrunk to the size of a kumquat.

All of<br />\nwhich is perhaps an unnecessary<br />\nintroduction to this little diversion whose theme is that the<br />\nmoral precepts which can be<br />\ndrawn from a knowledge of the<br />\nimplications of the free verse<br />\ntechnique of Walt Whitman are<br />\nentirely similar to those which<br />\ncan be drawn from the ethos of<br />\nthe murderer.<br />\nYou will probably have guessed<br />\nby now., that it is the word<br />\nfree which is to be stressed,<br />\nfor as soon as a writer insists<br />\nthat all formal barriers of technique be razed (\"Unscrew the<br />\nlocks from the doors!

On the other hand, Dr. Richard Cummerbund Twonkey, who, as the whole world knows, translated<br />\n\"The Pajama Game\" into Middle High Bactrian, contended<br />\nin his paper that the Old Wendish rune \"pt\" derives from the<br />\nLow Erse rune \"mf\" (pronounced \"gr\").<br />\nWell, sir the discussion grew so heated that Dr. Twonkey<br />\nfinally asked Dr. Spleen if he would like to step into the gymnasium and put on the gloves. Dr. Spleen accepted the challenge promptly, but the contest was never held because there<br />\nWere no gloves in the gymnasium that would fit Dr. Twonkey.<br />\n(The reader is doubtless finding this hard to believe as<br />\nEastern Reserve University is celebrated the length and breadth<br />\nof the land for the size of its glove collection. However, the<br />\nreader is asked to remember that Dr. Twonkey has extraordinarily small hands and arms. In fact, he spent the last<br />\nWar working in a small-arms plant, where lie received two<br />\nNavy \"E\" Awards and was widely hailed as a \"manly little<br />\n\u00a9 1901 Max Shulman<br />\nchap.\")<br /><br />\nrest of this little piece I seem<br />\nto be taking what appears to be<br />\nmerely a rather clever idea to its<br />\nlimits, I should urge that we discover the essence of the commonplace only in the extremes<br />\nto which it might be pushed.<br />\nNow I should like to carry out<br />\nthis argument a bit further. I<br />\nsubmit that old Walt, fat, hearty<br />\nand optimistic, is one of the most<br />\ndangerous writers who has ever<br />\npublished a line and that the<br />\nacademic embarrassment in the<br />\nface of Walt's largesse is symptomatic of a subconscious knowledge of this fact. I submit that<br />\nMr. Eliot's somewhat pathetic<br />\ninsistence that \"no verse is free\"<br />\nis nothing more than an hysterical defense against the anarchic tendencies of his own<br />\nform; the fact that his later<br />\nworks, as well as the poetry<br />\nof the current academic generation, are for the most part highly<br />\nformal, would seem to bear me<br />\nout. I presume that Mr. Eliot's<br />\nargument hinges on the so-called<br />\n\"ineluctable limits\" of<br />\nthe<br />\nhuman breath; but the natural<br />\nlaws of breathing and the unnatural laws of meter are two different things; and, of course,<br />\nman can alter his pace of breathing at will, so much so that the<br />\norganic laws of breath are ultimately as flexible and, who<br />\nknows, perhaps as suicidal\u2014as<br />\nthe laws that govern the gang<br />\nas apart from the community.<br />\nPerhaps this Faustian plunge,<br />\nredolent of Renaissance man, is<br />\nself-destructive at the root and<br />\nall roads in the modern world<br />\nlead to nada. But I digress, as<br />\nMax Schulman says. Another<br />\nAmerican poet, William Carlos<br />\nWilliams, has castigated imagism (a movement which made<br />\nfree verse one of its battlecries) for not having discovered<br />\n\"structural necessity.\" Significantly, Mr. Williams is not terribly fond of Whitman, and his<br />\nown later verse is composed in<br />\na relatively strict three-beat line.<br />\nBut, aside from Mr. Williams,<br />\nmost modern critics and poets\u2014<br />\nand this is a fascinating point-are notoriously unwilling to dis(Continued on Page 6)<br /><br />\nNORTH AMERICAN AVIATION, INC.*<br /><br />\nStudents' Shop in Levering<br />\nHall<br />\nManufactured by<br /><br />\nJ.

There<br />\nare no scholarships, but even more hard to swallow is that<br />\nthere is no student support.<br />\nThis might well be a reason why the hoop squad<br />\nposted such a poor record this year. It can't be blamed on<br />\nthe players because these same hoopsters as Freshmen in<br />\nthe previous years lost a total of 4 games in 25 against<br />\nthe same competition.<br />\nThe real difference is that the hoopsters lacked the<br />\ndesire to win because it made very little difference to<br />\nanyone if they did. As the scores became worse and worse<br />\nthe team soon lost all interest in ,the garrie itself. If the<br />\nteam deserves any slaps on the back it is for having the<br />\nguts to stick with what they soon considered a bad mistake,<br />\nespecially when the time they spent with it hurt their<br />\nscholastic standings. It can be predicted with almost<br />\nstartling accuracy that all but two will not be back for<br />\nmore next year. But that's sports at Hopkins.<br />\nCOPYRIGHT j1.961, THE COCA-COLA COMPANY.

As for the<br />\ndorm students, not a single one<br />\nwhom I spoke with was in favor<br />\nof the addition of advisors.<br /><br />\nDorm Advisors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI have refrained this year from<br />\nthe popular fad of criticizing<br />\ncampus organizations because I<br />\nthink that a great deal of the<br />\nSolution lies in student attitudes<br />\nand desire for effective student<br />\ngovernment. However, I feel that<br />\nI must make a few remarks<br />\nabout the present situation in<br />\nthe D.S.R.C. It seems that<br />\nelected bodies must constantly<br />\nbe reminded that they were<br />\nelected and are in theory at least<br />\nsubject to the will of the electorate.<br />\nIn the present discussion of<br />\nthe D.S.R.C. the feasibility of<br />\nhaving more dorm advisors has<br />\nbeen referred to committee, Notice that the matter was not<br />\ntabled for a few weeks in order<br />\nto ascertain student opinion, it<br />\nwas sent to a committee for discussion. This addition of advisors, a rather poorly disguised<br />\nmaneuver by the Administration,<br /><br />\nI believe in the Gentleman's<br />\nCode and the Hopkins traditions<br />\nthat we are all considered mature enough to go to classes<br />\nand attend to our daily affairs<br />\nwithout the need of Big Brothers. To me, the most lamentable<br />\naspect of this situation is that<br />\nthe Administration is getting exactly what it wants from the<br />\nD.S.R.C.\u2014student endorsement<br />\nof a curtailment of student freedom. I therefore suggest that<br />\nsince the D.S.R.C. seems to have<br />\nno intention of submitting this<br />\nproposal to the dorms in a plebiscite, and I feel it is important<br />\nenough for such action, that the<br />\ndorm students should avail<br />\nthemselves of every opportunity<br />\nof protest by attending the<br />\nD.S.R.C. meetings and writing<br />\nthe News-Letter Fraternity men<br />\nshould also be aware that perhaps the fraternity houses may<br />\nalso soon need advisors, or are<br />\nthey called house-mothers?<br /><br />\n-NOTICESANNOUNCER<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 7)<br />\ntwo year unbeaten record in dual<br />\nmeet competition, having scored<br />\nfifteen straight victories.<br />\nAgainst Catholic U. last Saturday the matmen compiled<br />\ntheir biggest point spread of the<br />\ncampaign.
