Can a college weekly<br />\nor semi-weekly be worth anything (even the subscription price)<br />\nto the student who reads it? These questions have been worrying<br />\nus for quite a while, and whereas we are incapable of satisfactorily<br />\nanswering them ourselves, we can at least analyze them and wait<br />\nfor comments\u2014constructive or non-constructive.<br />\nA semi-weekly of the type of the NEWS-LETTER attempts to<br />\nprint news that pertains directly to the undergraduate body as<br />\nHopkins students. It makes little effort to give detailed information concerning what is happening in other departments of the<br />\nUniversity, not much more concerning the goings-on at other colleges, and none at all about topics not of a direct college nature.<br />\nMuch of the news is stale by the time that it appears, and a portion of it is of interest only to certain men. It would be possible,<br />\nif the readers so desired, to publish more news of other Universities (or other departments of this University), but there has<br />\nbeen no articulate demand for such news.<br />\nThe paper's editorial policy can be one of several varieties.<br />\nThe editorials can shout \"Hurrah\"- and comment inanely upon<br />\ncampus events, making an obsequious attempt to please everybody.<br />\nThey can take issue with every question which lends itself to argument, and can invent a few besides. Or they can try to \"mirror\"<br />\ncampus opinion\u2014if there be such a thing. They can be a compromise between the first two policies, and, of course, they can be<br />\na kind of conglomerate potpourri of all three.<br />\nThey can attempt to evaluate the courses offered to the students, as has been done at Harvard. They can make an effort to<br />\ninfluence students in matters of a wider interest than pure \"campus<br />\ntopics.\" They can criticise activities and individuals in the campus<br />\nlimelight\u2014favorably or adversely. None of these have, to our<br />\nknowledge, been tried on this campus. The most weighty objection, it seems, is that the campus is so small that it is extremely<br />\ndifficult (and undesirable, say some) to avoid the personal element<br />\nin conducting a campus newspaper. \"<br />\nFor the remainder of this year, we are inclined to evade the<br />\nissue, for it is too late to formulate a definite policy which could<br />\nbear fruit. To the extent that we sincerely desire to give the student body the type of newspaper that it wants (within limits\u2014<br />\nfinancial and otherwise), we aim to please. Who knows that the<br />\nmajority doesn't want any at all? We invite expressions of opinion on this subject, for we should like something to .think about<br />\nduring the summer. Are we wasting much valuable time, or do<br />\nwe or can we accomplish a certain amount of positive good?<br />\n<br />\nDO WE \"RATE\" IT?<br />\n<br />\nFACULTY OF PHILOSOPHY STUDENT BOOK STORE TO<br />\nCATALOGUE HAS MANY<br />\nOPEN THIS SPRING<br />\nNEW COURSES<br />\nDURING EXAMS<br />\nMajority of Those Dropped from Col- Will Enable Students Who Will Not<br />\nlege List Are Found in<br />\nReturn Next Year to Get<br />\nNew Bulletin<br />\nRid of Old Stock<br />\n<br />\nA comparison of the 1926-27 catalogue of the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences with the Faculty of Philosophy circular for 1927-28, just issued, drives home the change which<br />\nDr. Frank J.

Can a college weekly<br />\nor semi-weekly be worth anything (even the subscription price)<br />\nto the student who reads it? These questions have been worrying<br />\nus for quite a while, and whereas we are incapable of satisfactorily<br />\nanswering them ourselves, we can at least analyze them and wait<br />\nfor comments\u2014constructive or non-constructive.<br />\nA semi-weekly of the type of the NEWS-LETTER attempts to<br />\nprint news that pertains directly to the undergraduate body as<br />\nHopkins students. It makes little effort to give detailed information concerning what is happening in other departments of the<br />\nUniversity, not much more concerning the goings-on at other colleges, and none at all about topics not of a direct college nature.<br />\nMuch of the news is stale by the time that it appears, and a portion of it is of interest only to certain men. It would be possible,<br />\nif the readers so desired, to publish more news of other Universities (or other departments of this University), but there has<br />\nbeen no articulate demand for such news.<br />\nThe paper's editorial policy can be one of several varieties.<br />\nThe editorials can shout \"Hurrah\"- and comment inanely upon<br />\ncampus events, making an obsequious attempt to please everybody.<br />\nThey can take issue with every question which lends itself to argument, and can invent a few besides. Or they can try to \"mirror\"<br />\ncampus opinion\u2014if there be such a thing. They can be a compromise between the first two policies, and, of course, they can be<br />\na kind of conglomerate potpourri of all three.<br />\nThey can attempt to evaluate the courses offered to the students, as has been done at Harvard. They can make an effort to<br />\ninfluence students in matters of a wider interest than pure \"campus<br />\ntopics.\" They can criticise activities and individuals in the campus<br />\nlimelight\u2014favorably or adversely. None of these have, to our<br />\nknowledge, been tried on this campus. The most weighty objection, it seems, is that the campus is so small that it is extremely<br />\ndifficult (and undesirable, say some) to avoid the personal element<br />\nin conducting a campus newspaper. \"<br />\nFor the remainder of this year, we are inclined to evade the<br />\nissue, for it is too late to formulate a definite policy which could<br />\nbear fruit. To the extent that we sincerely desire to give the student body the type of newspaper that it wants (within limits\u2014<br />\nfinancial and otherwise), we aim to please. Who knows that the<br />\nmajority doesn't want any at all? We invite expressions of opinion on this subject, for we should like something to .think about<br />\nduring the summer. Are we wasting much valuable time, or do<br />\nwe or can we accomplish a certain amount of positive good?<br /><br />\nDO WE \"RATE\" IT?<br /><br />\nFACULTY OF PHILOSOPHY STUDENT BOOK STORE TO<br />\nCATALOGUE HAS MANY<br />\nOPEN THIS SPRING<br />\nNEW COURSES<br />\nDURING EXAMS<br />\nMajority of Those Dropped from Col- Will Enable Students Who Will Not<br />\nlege List Are Found in<br />\nReturn Next Year to Get<br />\nNew Bulletin<br />\nRid of Old Stock<br /><br />\nA comparison of the 1926-27 catalogue of the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences with the Faculty of Philosophy circular for 1927-28, just issued, drives home the change which<br />\nDr. Frank J.
