The Middies are<br />\nthe only team to have turned back<br />\nthe Jays thus far. He stated that<br />\n\"they have a good coach, good<br />\nmaterial, and have won most of<br />\ntheir matches by very decisive<br />\nscores. I expect to see a better<br />\nclass of fencers than we have for<br />\nthe most part this season, and<br />\nthe boys will really have to be on<br />\ntheir toes to handle it.\"<br />\nLast Saturday afternon, the<br />\nBlue Jay fencers met and beat a<br />\nvisiting Haverford College team<br />\nby the lop-sided score of 18-9. According to Schlick, \"the greatest<br />\nsingle factor in the victory was<br />\nthe spirit of the team Which<br />\nseemed to sort of overwhelm the<br />\nopposition. Even the substitutes<br />\ncaught it and turned in victories<br />\nin their bouts.\"<br />\nHopkins captured all three<br />\nclasses- of the match, taking the<br />\n<br />\nfoil 5-4, the epee 7-2, and the<br />\nsabre 6-3. Dick Everett began to<br />\nshape up to pre-season predictions. Everett turned in three successive victories in his event.<br />\nHowie Pierce and Fred Rosenbloom each recorded 1-2 slates in<br />\nthe event.<br />\nSchlick praised Tom Feher's<br />\nperformance in the epee. Tom<br />\nemerged victorious in two bouts<br />\nbefore making way for a substitute. Mark Zequeira, who substituted for him, won the third. Joe<br />\nRivkin, 1-1; Sid Miller, 1-0; and<br />\nAl Rose, 2-1; rounded out the<br />\nscoring for Hopkins in the event.<br />\nCaptain John Forte continued<br />\nhis winning ways in the sabre,<br />\ncoming out on top twice, without<br />\na setback. Joe Fetsch substituted<br />\nfor him in the third bout and<br />\nkept the winning streak going.<br />\nFetsch, as Schlick pointed out, is<br />\na victim of circumstances. He is<br />\n<br />\ninexperienced and up against experienced teammates in that weapon of the fencing team 'which<br />\nranks highest. Thus far, Joe has<br />\nbeen in four bouts and won all of<br />\nthem. Darryl Carter and Dick<br />\nHeckman turned in 2-1 and 1-2<br />\nrecords respectively in the Sabre<br />\nevent.<br />\nSince each man must go 36<br />\nbouts, top conditioning is of the<br />\nutmost importance. Only one man<br />\nfrom Hopkins will participate in<br />\neach weapon. Forte looks like a<br />\nsure bet to go in the sabre, while<br />\nEverett will most likely get the go<br />\nahead sign in the foil.<br />\n<br />\nSTOTLER<br />\nGULF STATION<br />\n401 E. 33rd St.<br />\nCH. 3-9181<br />\n<br />\nST.

Joe<br />\nRivkin, 1-1; Sid Miller, 1-0; and<br />\nAl Rose, 2-1; rounded out the<br />\nscoring for Hopkins in the event.<br />\nCaptain John Forte continued<br />\nhis winning ways in the sabre,<br />\ncoming out on top twice, without<br />\na setback. Joe Fetsch substituted<br />\nfor him in the third bout and<br />\nkept the winning streak going.<br />\nFetsch, as Schlick pointed out, is<br />\na victim of circumstances. He is<br /><br />\ninexperienced and up against experienced teammates in that weapon of the fencing team 'which<br />\nranks highest. Thus far, Joe has<br />\nbeen in four bouts and won all of<br />\nthem. Darryl Carter and Dick<br />\nHeckman turned in 2-1 and 1-2<br />\nrecords respectively in the Sabre<br />\nevent.<br />\nSince each man must go 36<br />\nbouts, top conditioning is of the<br />\nutmost importance.
