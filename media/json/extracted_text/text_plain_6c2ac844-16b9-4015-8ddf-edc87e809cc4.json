It is turning that<br />\ncolor seemingly to keep green all<br />\nthe memories of the man it portrays. The man is Sidney Lanier.<br />\nHis memory is kept alive in another way here at Hopkins. On<br />\nthe third floor of Gilman Hall a<br />\nroom had been set aside and dedicated as the 'Lanier Room.\" It is<br />\nthe respected site for the admirers of the Southern poet; for all<br />\nhis original manuscripts, and<br />\nDarts of his personal belongings<br />\nare housed there. The room was<br />\ndedicated in 1942, the centennial<br />\nof Lanier's birth. All the books<br />\nand furniture found there were<br />\ndonated by the poet's son, Charles<br />\nW. Lanier.<br />\nAvailable And Valuable<br />\nUniversity students and people<br />\nfrom many different professions<br />\nvisit the room to make use of its<br />\nresources. Along the wall are<br />\nglass-covered book shelves that<br />\nhouse various editions of Lanier's<br />\nworks. Beneath these are panel<br />\ndoors, and behind them there are<br />\nSliding files of metal boxes in<br />\nWhich Lanier's manuscripts are<br />\nPreserved forever. There are letters to and from him.<br />\nCorrespondence from Whitman,<br />\nLongfellow, other fellow poets,<br />\n000000000000000000000000<br />\n24 Hours of Dependable<br />\n1<br />\nService At<br />\n<br />\nPETERSON'S<br />\nESSO STATION<br />\n33rd St. & Greenmount Ave.<br />\nTelephone: Cr. 3390<br />\n000000000000000000000000<br />\n<br />\nThe amount of culture it holds<br />\nis not its only impressive aspect.<br />\nThis is heightened by the atmosphere of the place.

Thies, who knows more about<br />\nthe room and the poet than one<br />\n\u2022<br />\ncould ask.<br />\nHopkins Lecturer<br />\nThe reason for this room-memorial is obvious. Over the entrance of the room is a plaque<br />\nwhich explains Lanier's connection with Hopkins.

Mr. Logan referred<br />\n<br />\nif they want to go down in the record books. After a hasty<br />\nconsultation with our musty files, the 'Nester found that the<br />\nJays aren't doing so badly after all. Out of 260 major colleges<br />\nlast year at least three had more than 300 points tallyed against<br />\nthem. Shaw University apparently led the parade with a grand<br />\ntotal of 328 against nine rivals\u2014averaging 45.4 per game.<br />\nThe Utah State Aggies had a rough go of it in eight games,<br />\nwatching 316 counters cross their goal -average 39.5 per.<br />\nVirginia Polytech ran a close third with an eight game total of<br />\n306 for a 38.2 average.<br />\nSeveral teams had well over the two hundred mark. Wooster<br />\nCollege from Ohio was right at the top of the list with 286 for<br />\nseven games. Following in order were: the U. of Richmond-279<br />\nin eight games; Western Reserve-267 in eight tilts; University<br />\nof [tali-256 in nine; the Nevade U \"Wolfpack\"-253 in six;<br />\nthe mighty Boston \"Crimson\", Harvard-248 points against eight<br />\ntop-flight opponents. In our own sphere, the same Gettysburg<br />\nsquad that whipped last year's Jays into 46 to 14 submission had<br />\n203 points scored against them in their nine game slate.<br />\nWith five games remaining the big Blue will have to allow \"He always makes such a proan average of 19 points per game if they want to reach that duction of putting in the<br />\nlower-high bracket of 200 and to reach the glorious 300 point Angostura*.\"<br />\ncategoric they'll have to really uncork with a grand-slam 361,lus average.

That was right after they beat Hopkins a Manhattan<br />\n<br />\nAwcorria.<br />\n<br />\n20-14.<br />\nSo, with the firm conviction that ball games cannot be won<br />\nwith an offense alone, the eyes of the Hopkins sports world will<br />\nbe on the defensive Blue mules again this Saturday.<br />\nAll sorts of football fireworks may be breaking out in<br />\nthe coaching circles of the Southern Conference very shortly.<br />\nhi September the conference presidents got together at Chapel<br />\nHill and drafted a series of recommendations which they felt<br />\n1%.ould help cut down the onslaught of \"big-time\" football in<br />\nthe Southlands. The recommendations are: 1) To restrict or<br />\neliminate all out of season practice; 2) To forbid the use of<br />\nfreshman in varsity competition after next September; 3) To<br />\nmake ineligible all transfer students who played on the freshman or varsity teams of the sport in another four year college;<br />\n4) To require a faculty member, not the coaches, to do the<br />\nvoting at conference meetings; 5) To retain the new conference resolution which prevents freshmen with athletic scholarships from accepting jobs; 6) To forbid participation in<br />\nPost-season bowl games as of next January 1.<br />\nThe final voting on these recommendations will be held at the<br />\nconference meeting in Richmond December 7. It is believed in<br />\nmost circles that they will be passed without any trouble; and if<br />\nthey are, our hats go off to the conference presidents. Without a<br />\ndoubt, college football has grown far too big and powerful for its<br />\ngold-plated - shoulder pads. It's impossible to keep giving the<br />\nbig boy a bigger set of pads every year. The only thing to do is cut<br />\nthe lad down to useful size, the size he was intended to be.

On<br />\nthe third floor of Gilman Hall a<br />\nroom had been set aside and dedicated as the 'Lanier Room.\" It is<br />\nthe respected site for the admirers of the Southern poet; for all<br />\nhis original manuscripts, and<br />\nDarts of his personal belongings<br />\nare housed there. The room was<br />\ndedicated in 1942, the centennial<br />\nof Lanier's birth. All the books<br />\nand furniture found there were<br />\ndonated by the poet's son, Charles<br />\nW. Lanier.<br />\nAvailable And Valuable<br />\nUniversity students and people<br />\nfrom many different professions<br />\nvisit the room to make use of its<br />\nresources. Along the wall are<br />\nglass-covered book shelves that<br />\nhouse various editions of Lanier's<br />\nworks. Beneath these are panel<br />\ndoors, and behind them there are<br />\nSliding files of metal boxes in<br />\nWhich Lanier's manuscripts are<br />\nPreserved forever.

After a hasty<br />\nconsultation with our musty files, the 'Nester found that the<br />\nJays aren't doing so badly after all. Out of 260 major colleges<br />\nlast year at least three had more than 300 points tallyed against<br />\nthem. Shaw University apparently led the parade with a grand<br />\ntotal of 328 against nine rivals\u2014averaging 45.4 per game.<br />\nThe Utah State Aggies had a rough go of it in eight games,<br />\nwatching 316 counters cross their goal -average 39.5 per.<br />\nVirginia Polytech ran a close third with an eight game total of<br />\n306 for a 38.2 average.<br />\nSeveral teams had well over the two hundred mark. Wooster<br />\nCollege from Ohio was right at the top of the list with 286 for<br />\nseven games. Following in order were: the U. of Richmond-279<br />\nin eight games; Western Reserve-267 in eight tilts; University<br />\nof [tali-256 in nine; the Nevade U \"Wolfpack\"-253 in six;<br />\nthe mighty Boston \"Crimson\", Harvard-248 points against eight<br />\ntop-flight opponents. In our own sphere, the same Gettysburg<br />\nsquad that whipped last year's Jays into 46 to 14 submission had<br />\n203 points scored against them in their nine game slate.<br />\nWith five games remaining the big Blue will have to allow \"He always makes such a proan average of 19 points per game if they want to reach that duction of putting in the<br />\nlower-high bracket of 200 and to reach the glorious 300 point Angostura*.\"<br />\ncategoric they'll have to really uncork with a grand-slam 361,lus average.

The recommendations are: 1) To restrict or<br />\neliminate all out of season practice; 2) To forbid the use of<br />\nfreshman in varsity competition after next September; 3) To<br />\nmake ineligible all transfer students who played on the freshman or varsity teams of the sport in another four year college;<br />\n4) To require a faculty member, not the coaches, to do the<br />\nvoting at conference meetings; 5) To retain the new conference resolution which prevents freshmen with athletic scholarships from accepting jobs; 6) To forbid participation in<br />\nPost-season bowl games as of next January 1.<br />\nThe final voting on these recommendations will be held at the<br />\nconference meeting in Richmond December 7. It is believed in<br />\nmost circles that they will be passed without any trouble; and if<br />\nthey are, our hats go off to the conference presidents. Without a<br />\ndoubt, college football has grown far too big and powerful for its<br />\ngold-plated - shoulder pads.
