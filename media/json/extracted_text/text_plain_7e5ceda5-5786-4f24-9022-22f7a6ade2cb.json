The unfortunate one may yet greet<br />\nthe yuletide in the way it deserves. One block north, and one west, and he reaches the fount<br />\nof Bacchus and happiness. An hour or so of worship at this shrine, and the most desolate<br />\nwill see the silver fringe of the cloud of trouble.<br />\n<br />\nViNtZSZfirlv<br />\nztAorv<br />\n\u2022v<br />\nt\u2022p,, r,<br />\n<br />\nvvv<br />\n*v \u2022<br />\n\u2713 4,4<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\n1:\u2022 VV11104,<br />\nV 111<br />\nVISV,<br />\n.- Ac<br />\n,<br />\n, etiA\u2022 14, vvrIzr....,,b<br />\n<br />\nE understand that there is a committee, appointed by the president of<br />\nthe Athletic Association, whose duty is to look after the Trophy<br />\nRoom and to see that the pictures are properly hung, and the banners,<br />\nflags, cups and such are kept in their proper places. Well, a casual<br />\nvisit to the Trophy Room shows that the committee needs to get to<br />\nwork. The class flags, we believe, are still in the cloak room.<br />\nThe banners are not hung. The pictures are awry, and one, at<br />\nleast, has never been put on the wall. The clock is usually not<br />\ngoing, and the interior of the of case for the special trophies needs\u2014<br />\nwell rearranging, to say the least. Now, committee, get to work.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nAST year the NEWS-LETTER ventured to make the suggestion that the<br />\ncustom of having spring football practice be inaugurated at Hopkins.<br />\nThe suggestion was not accepted, and, therefore, we repeat it this<br />\nyear, somewhat earlier in the season, and ask that the authorities on<br />\nthe question considei the suggestion seriously. It is a well-known<br />\n4? fact that in the North, colleges of athletic reputation find spring foot'<br />\nball practice of the greatest value. The conflict here between<br />\nlacrosse and football is not sufficiently great, we believe, to prevent<br />\nthe establishing of this custom. The cage could be used by the football squad on the days when the field at Homewood is not available<br />\nbecause of the lacrosse men. If the adoption of this suggestion, however, would tend to interfere with the work of the lacrosse team, it should not be seriously considered. Yet we can<br />\nnot see that this would be the case, and again urge the officers of the Athletic Association to<br />\nconsider the question carefully. It is an unquestionable fact that the amount of judicious practice which members of the football squad are able to have, is of great importance in the building up of a good, strong, all-around team. We think the idea of spring practice can be put in<br />\noperation here just as well as at Northern Colleges. The college spirit this year at the University makes the idea possible. Can't we make a try at putting it in operation?<br />\n<br />\n10.)<br />\nrt:<br />\n!.'4\"1111tii<br />\nslurs*<br />\n<br />\nF.: received a letter from the Lacrosse Team of 1902, in regard to the<br />\n<br />\ninter-class lacrosse games. The team has most generously offered<br />\ntrophies for the winners of two out of three games between the<br />\nsophomore and freshman classes. We are very glad to see that<br />\nw\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nLacrosse Team of 1902 is going to continue the custom, which it be*.<br />\n\u2022<br />\ngan a few years ago. The conditions are practically the same, with<br />\nthe addition of the seventh clause. This is a very just clause, since<br />\nit gives a preference to men who have come out and have worked<br />\nhard and faithfully, over those who come out at the last moment and<br />\non account of their physical superiority are given positions on the<br />\nteam.<br />\nWe regret very much that we could not publish the letter in our last issue, but it was<br />\nreceived too late.<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nvirvvvv-v*Inorw<br />\n<br />\nIt is with profound regret that the NEWS-LETTER has heard of the death of Mr. Weston<br />\nHarding of the class of nineteen seven. The sad tidings came as a great shock to those<br />\nwho had known Mr. Harding while he was at the University, for he had endeared himself<br />\nboth among the professors and the student body by his cheerful and pleasant ways. At the<br />\ntime of his death, he was a professor in St. John's University, Shanghai, China and doing<br />\nnoble work.<br />\n<br />\n1,<br />\n)<br />\n<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER wishes to congratulate Mr. McCabe on his election to the important \u2022<br />\npost of Football Captain. We believe that the team has made a wise choice, and we expect<br />\ngreat things next season, even the defeat of St. John's.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, December 14, 1908.<br />\nMR. FRANKLIN B. PEDRICK,<br />\nEditor-in-chief of the NEws-LETTER,<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDear Sir:\u2014On reading in the daily papers<br />\na few days ago that a call for candidates for<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Lacrosse Team of 1909<br />\nhad gone forth, we were awakened to the<br />\nfact that the undergraduates would probably<br />\nlike to know whether the Inter-class trophies<br />\nwould again be donated this year.<br />\nThe undersigned have kept a close watch<br />\non the class games io see what effect they<br />\nhave in improving the general efficiency of<br />\nthe 'Varsity team. Taking all in all, we are<br />\nsatisfied that the result is worth while; at the<br />\nthe same time we do not believe it is productive of the best results nor fair to some of the<br />\nclass members to play men on the class teams<br />\nwho never pick up a stick until the day of the<br />\nfirst-class game and then only play in the<br />\nseries to carry off a trophy. We wish to<br />\ndevelop lacrosse material and think a man<br />\nwho has come out and worked with the squad,<br />\nalthough inferior in physical powers to some<br />\nother man who has shown no interest up to<br />\nthe date of the games, should by all means be<br />\ngiven the preference for a place on the team.<br />\nTo put this idea into practical effect we have<br />\nadded section seven to the usual list of conditions given below.<br />\nTo meet the change of class arrangement<br />\nwhich has taken place at the University, the<br />\nLacrosse Team of 1902 this year offers to<br />\ndonate twelve Inter-class trophies to the<br />\nstudent body of the Johns Hopkins University\u2014to be played for by the sophomore and<br />\nfreshman classes, instead of the juniors and<br />\nfreshmen as has been the custom heretofore.<br />\nThe conditions governing the contest to be<br />\nas follows:<br />\nFirst.\u2014The parties tc\u2022 the contest shall be<br />\ntwelve players picked from the sophomore<br />\nclass on the one side; and twelve players<br />\npicked from the freshman class on the other.<br />\nSecond.\u2014The games may be played on any<br />\nfield the contesting classes may select.<br />\nThird.\u2014The games are to be played if possible in March and up to the middle of April,<br />\nand on such dates as not to interfere with the<br />\npractice of the University Lacrosse Team.<br />\n<br />\nFourth.\u2014Two out of three games must be<br />\nplayed.<br />\nFifIh.\u2014Should any disputes arise between<br />\nthe two classes as to the eligibility of any<br />\nstudent, date and place of games, length of<br />\nhalves, officials, etc., it shall devolve upon a<br />\ncommittee consisting of the captain of the<br />\n'Varsity Lacrosse Team, the Physical Director<br />\nof the University and the President of the<br />\nBoard of Governors of the Athletic Association to pass on such disputes. Whatever<br />\ndecision may be reached by this committee<br />\nshall be final.<br />\nit should so happen that two or<br />\nmore men should be called on to fill the same<br />\nposition, in the same or different games<br />\nthroughout the series, it shall devolve on the<br />\nclass organization to select the player entitled<br />\nto receive the prize.<br />\nSeventh.\u2014A man who has enrolled himself<br />\nas a member of and worked with the class<br />\nsquad shall have preference over a man who<br />\nhas not done so.<br />\nWe suggest that the two classes appoint<br />\ntheir captains at their earliest opportunity, so<br />\nthat these men may see to it that their candidates report to practice with the 'Varsity<br />\nsquad and thus raise the standard of the class<br />\nteams.<br />\nWe also wish to express our approval of the<br />\naction of the lacrosse management of last<br />\nspring in giving the Baltimore City College<br />\nand the class teams an opportunity to play<br />\nmatch games on the same afternoon with the<br />\n'Varsity contests. It certainly kept things<br />\ngoing at the \"college\" and gave our class<br />\nteams practice.<br />\nIn conclusion we wish to call attention to<br />\nthe fact that some of us who live out of the<br />\ncity, and whose information with reference to<br />\nthe progress of the university teams is mostly<br />\ngleaned from the daily papers, are often surprised and hurt, after meeting some of the<br />\nboys who have been able to follow the teams<br />\nclosely, to find out that (since the newspaper<br />\naccounts are generally so inaccurate) we<br />\nreally do not know what is going on. On<br />\ncomparing notes we are convinced that this is<br />\nnot the fault of the Baltimore Press, but<br />\nrather of the student reporters,who,when they<br />\ndo not even know what men filled the respec-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ntive positions on the 'Varsity team of last<br />\nyear, are also too lazy to walk into the trophy<br />\nroom or ask someone who knows, so as to<br />\npost themselves on the elements of athletics;<br />\nbut write practically anything to fill space in<br />\nthe papers.<br />\nYet this is an old story, so we will not<br />\nbother you about it, and only ask you to give<br />\nthe matter of the inter-class trophies your attention in the columns of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nYours respectfully,<br />\nTHE LACROSSE TEAM OF 1902,<br />\nB.

In fact, Sunday is a<br />\nfavorite night for concerts, opera and the like.<br />\nSunday a week ago I heard the 'Damnation<br />\nof Faust,\"\u2014four soloists, a chorus of 200<br />\nvoices and an orchestra, under the direction<br />\nof Felix Motte, one of the most celebrated<br />\nconductors in Europe,\u2014one has music here<br />\nas never dreamt of. Think of a city the size<br />\nof Baltimore\u2014Munich has just the number of<br />\npeople we have \u2014supporting opera houses at<br />\nevery performances of which, at least 3000 to<br />\n4000 people attend. They have half-a-dozen<br />\nfirst-class theatres. Orchestra and string<br />\nquartet and solo concerts galore. Really it is<br />\nbewildering when one attempts to choose a<br />\nplace for an evening's entertainment, since<br />\nthe array of desirables is so great. In Baltimore, opera and Boston Symphony concerts<br />\nare looked forward to as one does to Christmas.<br />\nTuesday night I heard Schuman-Heink.<br />\nThe last time she appeared in Baltimore I<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nmissed her and this time I determined to<br />\nmake good the opportunity. We have reduced prices at the theatres and main concerts,<br />\nso for 25 cents I was admitted. She sang<br />\nwonderfully well and is loved not only for her<br />\nvoice, but also her simple hearted impulsiveness. After her final selection had been sung<br />\na wild burst of enthusiasm broke forth. With<br />\ntheir hand-clappingsand bravos they crowded<br />\nto the stage. Of course, I was up front. At<br />\nlast she did give an encore, and as she was<br />\nleaving the stage, I being very close, called<br />\nfor, \"Sweet Thoughts of Home,\" that being<br />\nthe name of a song I once heard her sing in<br />\nBaltimore. She smiled at me and putting her<br />\nhand to her breast, said in English, \"I only<br />\nwish\"\u2014and was lost in the crowd.<br />\nLast Sunday afternoon I went to hear<br />\n\"Tristan and Tsaede\" Wagner's opera, and<br />\nto be more able to fully understand it, I spent<br />\nSaturday afternoon and evening reading the<br />\nstory in German and the explanation of the<br />\nmusic. The opera house was crowded, some<br />\n3000-4000. It was a rather curious sight to<br />\nwatch the promenade of beautifully gowned<br />\nladies and the military men in their brilliant<br />\nuniforms. Of course, Germany is all military<br />\nand the way the officers strut about makes<br />\none feel that he has no right to be living anyway.<br />\nIt is most marvelous when one considers<br />\nGermany's military equipment. It is strange<br />\nthat a country no larger than New York and<br />\nPennsylvania should have a standing army of<br />\n100,000 and more, and that in 24 hours she<br />\ncould have one million men in the field.<br />\n<br />\n[THE END.]<br />\n()<br />\nTHE HARE'S FOOT CLUB.<br />\nThe Executive Committee of the Hare's<br />\nFoot Club held a meeting on December 6th,<br />\nand decided definitely to produce '`The<br />\nMagistrate,\" a farcial comedy in three acts,<br />\nat Albaugh's Theatre, on the evenings of<br />\nFebruary 16th and 17th. The play is one of<br />\nthe most popular pieces of Arthur Wing<br />\nPiller\u00b0, the well-known English play-writer,<br />\nand like all his comedies has a plot that is not<br />\nlike the usual farce; its dialogue is clever and<br />\nand the action and fun continuous.

He came of a wealthy<br />\nfamily, and, since all of his near relatives<br />\nwere dead, was possessed of a fortune large<br />\nenough to make work unnecessary for the<br />\nrest of his life. Nevertheless, he prosecuted<br />\nhis studies as earnestly as I, who contemplated<br />\nentering upon a medical career. His favorite<br />\nsubjects were the exact sciences, especially<br />\nchemistry and physics, and, strangely enough,<br />\nhe was rather inclined towards occultism.<br />\nSo much I knew from hearsay during the<br />\nfirst term of our college life; I became better<br />\nacquainted with him through an accident. I<br />\nhad often seen him working in the laboratory,<br />\nand wondered who the tall, handsome man,<br />\nwith the dark face and piercing gray eyes,<br />\nmight be. Late one day, we were working<br />\nafter the rest had left,\u2014I, anxious to finish a<br />\nprescribed experiment; he, I suppose, dabbling in something of his own. Suddenly I<br />\nheard a loud report, the peculiar crackling hiss<br />\nof cold water and hot glass, and exclamations<br />\nof anger and pain from his part of the room.<br />\nI left my work, and, going to him, found his<br />\nhand badly cut and his apparatus in ruins. I<br />\noffered to bind up the wound, and, while<br />\ndoing so, asked what had happened. A retort,<br />\nhad exploded, he said, while he was experimenting with \"ether and other things.\"<br />\n\"Why were you doing that?\" I asked;<br />\nrather rudely, perhaps.<br />\n\"For my own amusement. Very neatly<br />\ndone, Doctor, thank you;\" and he looked<br />\nthrough me with those unfathomable gray<br />\neyes.<br />\nFrom this incident arose acqaintance, friendship, then intimacy. I found him interesting,<br />\nand well-read on all subjects. He, I believe,<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nused me, with my practicality, as a foil to<br />\nhis own idealism. At bottom, our natures<br />\nwere antipodal, but on the surface we agreed<br />\nvery well; for our minds ran in the same<br />\nchannels, even when we were at variance.<br />\nWe studied together, confided our plans to<br />\none another, and, when we were graduated,<br />\nhad become inseparable. During my medical<br />\ncourse (he was then a graduate student in<br />\nchemistry), I saw him often, and, when<br />\nfinally I opened an office, he procured apartments in a nearby street, and we spent much<br />\ntime together.<br />\nDuring all this time he had said little concerning his belief in the occult, and I supposed he had outgrown it. One evening,<br />\nhowever, I went over to his house to borrow<br />\na book on the history of Germany in the<br />\nMiddle Ages. John, his servant, showed me<br />\ninto the laboratory.<br />\nThe laboratory was the room where Randolph practically lived. It was a long apartment, divided into two parts by a double<br />\ndoor. The smaller, at the far end, was the<br />\nlaboratory proper, with a long working-table,<br />\nand shelves of reagents and apparatus. The<br />\nlarger part of the room was a well-furnished<br />\nlibrary, filled with the oldest and newest of<br />\nbooks.<br />\nMy friend welcomed me, led me to the<br />\ncentral table, and lighted the lamp. I sat<br />\ndown in one easy-chair; he, after lighting<br />\npipes, in another, and thus we sat smoking in<br />\nsilence. I always waited for him to begin to<br />\ntalk; this evening he was unusually quiet.<br />\nAt the end of five minutes be took the pipe<br />\nfrom his mouth and said:<br />\n'Doc, what is time?\"<br />\n\"Half-past nine,\" I replied, looking at him<br />\nin surprise. \"What is the matter with your<br />\nwatch?''<br />\n\"No, not the time; what is time, time is<br />\ngeneral?'' I stared at him in amazement.<br />\n\"I merely wanted your ideas on the subject,\" he continued. \"A traveler ought to<br />\nknow something of the places he visits. I<br />\nshould like to take a trip through time.\"<br />\n\"Henry, Henry,\" said I laughing, \"have<br />\nyou gone back to those foolish ideas of your<br />\ncollege days? . But I suppose there is something in you that must come out; so let us<br />\nhave it. The sooner the better.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"Have I ever told you of my soul-theory?<br />\nDo not groan, I shall not burden you with all<br />\nof it now. Suffice it to say that I am firm in<br />\nthe belief that the soul is linked mysteriously<br />\nwith the body\u2014physically, of course. By the<br />\nsoul I mean the reasoning part of man, the<br />\nsensibilities, and the will,\u2014all that distinguishes him from the brute. This soul is<br />\ncomposed of atomic elements just as the body<br />\nis. These soul-elements are transmitted in<br />\nvarying combinations to the offspring by the<br />\nparents in just the same way as the bodyelements.<br />\nThey constitute the basis of<br />\nheredity, instinct, and so on, corresponding<br />\nto physical resemblance and similarity. Death<br />\nis a complete disintegration of the soul; followed by decay, the disintegration of the<br />\nbody. Since both soul and body are thus<br />\nresolved into their elements, or, more correctly, elementary combinations, the one is no<br />\nmore immortal than the other. That is my<br />\nbelief in a nutshell.\"<br />\n\"You are an atheistic dreamer.\"<br />\n\"You are a superstitious bigot. Now to<br />\nthe case in point, my friend went on. \"I<br />\nsuspect that there is a relation between all<br />\nthe so-called elements, physical and spiritual.<br />\nThey must be merely variations of a primitive<br />\nsubstance which can exist only in the<br />\ninfinite.\"<br />\n\"Explain,\" said I, \"I must confess, I<br />\ndon't quite understand.\"<br />\n'`I mean that, if a human being (body and<br />\nsoul) could be reduced to this primitive state,<br />\nduring such a process he would be outside of<br />\nspace and time, and could return to the sphere<br />\nof this universe, in any place or time he<br />\nchose, in exactly the same condition in<br />\nwhich he left it.' I remembered that sentence later.<br />\nRandolph smoked for a few moments in<br />\nsilence; then he continued: ''Who knows but<br />\nthat I may be some mysterious person in the<br />\nbygone ages; for instance, the Man in the<br />\nIron Mask or the soothsayer that warned<br />\nCLesar? Why should not either one of them<br />\nhave been some traveler from the past or the<br />\nfuture?\"<br />\n'Quite possible. But listen, Henry. Suppose that you should go back a couple of<br />\nhundreds or thousands of years; and that you<br />\nwere in a position to change history. I mean<br />\n<br />\nthis: that if a certain event, such as the murder of Cesar, were set down in history, and<br />\nyou should go to Cesar and warn him: and<br />\nhe should save himself, thus belying history<br />\n\u2014what then?'<br />\n\"That is a wonderful question. I have<br />\noften thought of it and would give worlds to<br />\nmake the experiment. Change history?\"<br />\nAnd he fell into a reverie.<br />\n\"It merely proves,\" said I, triumphantly,<br />\n'that the hypothesis that you can go back in<br />\ntime is unsound. Your subsequent reasoning<br />\nis flawless, yet the result if absurd; ergo, your<br />\nhypothesis is false. My 'Logic and Philosophy' taught me that much, if yours did not.<br />\nWhy did you go to college, anyway, Henry?\u2014<br />\n\"'There are more things in heaven and<br />\nearth than are dreamed of in your philosophy'.\"<br />\n\"To be serious again,\" said I, after a pause.<br />\n\"If your body and soul are disintegrated,<br />\nwhat is there left to direct your actions out in<br />\nthe infinite?\"<br />\n'That remains to be seen; there lies the<br />\nonly doubtful part of my theory. I think<br />\nthere is a vital principle, independent of soul<br />\nand body, which is eternal and indestructible.<br />\nIt is a part of a great whole, the 'ethereal<br />\nquintessence of Heaven,' if you will, and<br />\nmanifests itself in all organisms. It may be<br />\ntermed Life; taken in the aggregate, you may<br />\ncall it\u2014God.\"<br />\n'You are not sure of this, then?' I asked,<br />\na little sarcastically.<br />\n\"I am sure of nothing, but this is the most<br />\nuncertain.\"<br />\n\"You had better have a care, then, before<br />\nyou make an irretrievable step,\" I said, half<br />\njoking.<br />\n\"It is worth the chance,\" said he, as a faraway look came into the deep gray eyes.<br />\n\"This is all theory,\" said I, after another<br />\npause; \"have V ou any idea of the practical<br />\nside of the affair?\"<br />\n\"Only a little; but I am making progress.<br />\nI nearly killed myself yesterday by another<br />\nexplosion.\"<br />\n\"Henry, Henry, have a care,\" I said, with<br />\nreal anxiety for my friend's welfare. \"Let<br />\nthis foolish business alone. You will do<br />\nsomething terrible yet.

Well, a casual<br />\nvisit to the Trophy Room shows that the committee needs to get to<br />\nwork. The class flags, we believe, are still in the cloak room.<br />\nThe banners are not hung. The pictures are awry, and one, at<br />\nleast, has never been put on the wall. The clock is usually not<br />\ngoing, and the interior of the of case for the special trophies needs\u2014<br />\nwell rearranging, to say the least. Now, committee, get to work.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nAST year the NEWS-LETTER ventured to make the suggestion that the<br />\ncustom of having spring football practice be inaugurated at Hopkins.<br />\nThe suggestion was not accepted, and, therefore, we repeat it this<br />\nyear, somewhat earlier in the season, and ask that the authorities on<br />\nthe question considei the suggestion seriously. It is a well-known<br />\n4? fact that in the North, colleges of athletic reputation find spring foot'<br />\nball practice of the greatest value. The conflict here between<br />\nlacrosse and football is not sufficiently great, we believe, to prevent<br />\nthe establishing of this custom. The cage could be used by the football squad on the days when the field at Homewood is not available<br />\nbecause of the lacrosse men. If the adoption of this suggestion, however, would tend to interfere with the work of the lacrosse team, it should not be seriously considered. Yet we can<br />\nnot see that this would be the case, and again urge the officers of the Athletic Association to<br />\nconsider the question carefully. It is an unquestionable fact that the amount of judicious practice which members of the football squad are able to have, is of great importance in the building up of a good, strong, all-around team. We think the idea of spring practice can be put in<br />\noperation here just as well as at Northern Colleges. The college spirit this year at the University makes the idea possible. Can't we make a try at putting it in operation?<br /><br />\n10.)<br />\nrt:<br />\n!.'4\"1111tii<br />\nslurs*<br /><br />\nF.: received a letter from the Lacrosse Team of 1902, in regard to the<br /><br />\ninter-class lacrosse games. The team has most generously offered<br />\ntrophies for the winners of two out of three games between the<br />\nsophomore and freshman classes. We are very glad to see that<br />\nw\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nLacrosse Team of 1902 is going to continue the custom, which it be*.<br />\n\u2022<br />\ngan a few years ago. The conditions are practically the same, with<br />\nthe addition of the seventh clause. This is a very just clause, since<br />\nit gives a preference to men who have come out and have worked<br />\nhard and faithfully, over those who come out at the last moment and<br />\non account of their physical superiority are given positions on the<br />\nteam.<br />\nWe regret very much that we could not publish the letter in our last issue, but it was<br />\nreceived too late.<br />\n-<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nvirvvvv-v*Inorw<br /><br />\nIt is with profound regret that the NEWS-LETTER has heard of the death of Mr. Weston<br />\nHarding of the class of nineteen seven. The sad tidings came as a great shock to those<br />\nwho had known Mr. Harding while he was at the University, for he had endeared himself<br />\nboth among the professors and the student body by his cheerful and pleasant ways. At the<br />\ntime of his death, he was a professor in St. John's University, Shanghai, China and doing<br />\nnoble work.<br /><br />\n1,<br />\n)<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER wishes to congratulate Mr. McCabe on his election to the important \u2022<br />\npost of Football Captain. We believe that the team has made a wise choice, and we expect<br />\ngreat things next season, even the defeat of St. John's.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, December 14, 1908.<br />\nMR. FRANKLIN B. PEDRICK,<br />\nEditor-in-chief of the NEws-LETTER,<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDear Sir:\u2014On reading in the daily papers<br />\na few days ago that a call for candidates for<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Lacrosse Team of 1909<br />\nhad gone forth, we were awakened to the<br />\nfact that the undergraduates would probably<br />\nlike to know whether the Inter-class trophies<br />\nwould again be donated this year.<br />\nThe undersigned have kept a close watch<br />\non the class games io see what effect they<br />\nhave in improving the general efficiency of<br />\nthe 'Varsity team. Taking all in all, we are<br />\nsatisfied that the result is worth while; at the<br />\nthe same time we do not believe it is productive of the best results nor fair to some of the<br />\nclass members to play men on the class teams<br />\nwho never pick up a stick until the day of the<br />\nfirst-class game and then only play in the<br />\nseries to carry off a trophy. We wish to<br />\ndevelop lacrosse material and think a man<br />\nwho has come out and worked with the squad,<br />\nalthough inferior in physical powers to some<br />\nother man who has shown no interest up to<br />\nthe date of the games, should by all means be<br />\ngiven the preference for a place on the team.<br />\nTo put this idea into practical effect we have<br />\nadded section seven to the usual list of conditions given below.<br />\nTo meet the change of class arrangement<br />\nwhich has taken place at the University, the<br />\nLacrosse Team of 1902 this year offers to<br />\ndonate twelve Inter-class trophies to the<br />\nstudent body of the Johns Hopkins University\u2014to be played for by the sophomore and<br />\nfreshman classes, instead of the juniors and<br />\nfreshmen as has been the custom heretofore.<br />\nThe conditions governing the contest to be<br />\nas follows:<br />\nFirst.\u2014The parties tc\u2022 the contest shall be<br />\ntwelve players picked from the sophomore<br />\nclass on the one side; and twelve players<br />\npicked from the freshman class on the other.<br />\nSecond.\u2014The games may be played on any<br />\nfield the contesting classes may select.<br />\nThird.\u2014The games are to be played if possible in March and up to the middle of April,<br />\nand on such dates as not to interfere with the<br />\npractice of the University Lacrosse Team.<br /><br />\nFourth.\u2014Two out of three games must be<br />\nplayed.<br />\nFifIh.\u2014Should any disputes arise between<br />\nthe two classes as to the eligibility of any<br />\nstudent, date and place of games, length of<br />\nhalves, officials, etc., it shall devolve upon a<br />\ncommittee consisting of the captain of the<br />\n'Varsity Lacrosse Team, the Physical Director<br />\nof the University and the President of the<br />\nBoard of Governors of the Athletic Association to pass on such disputes. Whatever<br />\ndecision may be reached by this committee<br />\nshall be final.<br />\nit should so happen that two or<br />\nmore men should be called on to fill the same<br />\nposition, in the same or different games<br />\nthroughout the series, it shall devolve on the<br />\nclass organization to select the player entitled<br />\nto receive the prize.<br />\nSeventh.\u2014A man who has enrolled himself<br />\nas a member of and worked with the class<br />\nsquad shall have preference over a man who<br />\nhas not done so.<br />\nWe suggest that the two classes appoint<br />\ntheir captains at their earliest opportunity, so<br />\nthat these men may see to it that their candidates report to practice with the 'Varsity<br />\nsquad and thus raise the standard of the class<br />\nteams.<br />\nWe also wish to express our approval of the<br />\naction of the lacrosse management of last<br />\nspring in giving the Baltimore City College<br />\nand the class teams an opportunity to play<br />\nmatch games on the same afternoon with the<br />\n'Varsity contests. It certainly kept things<br />\ngoing at the \"college\" and gave our class<br />\nteams practice.<br />\nIn conclusion we wish to call attention to<br />\nthe fact that some of us who live out of the<br />\ncity, and whose information with reference to<br />\nthe progress of the university teams is mostly<br />\ngleaned from the daily papers, are often surprised and hurt, after meeting some of the<br />\nboys who have been able to follow the teams<br />\nclosely, to find out that (since the newspaper<br />\naccounts are generally so inaccurate) we<br />\nreally do not know what is going on. On<br />\ncomparing notes we are convinced that this is<br />\nnot the fault of the Baltimore Press, but<br />\nrather of the student reporters,who,when they<br />\ndo not even know what men filled the respec-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ntive positions on the 'Varsity team of last<br />\nyear, are also too lazy to walk into the trophy<br />\nroom or ask someone who knows, so as to<br />\npost themselves on the elements of athletics;<br />\nbut write practically anything to fill space in<br />\nthe papers.<br />\nYet this is an old story, so we will not<br />\nbother you about it, and only ask you to give<br />\nthe matter of the inter-class trophies your attention in the columns of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nYours respectfully,<br />\nTHE LACROSSE TEAM OF 1902,<br />\nB.

In fact, Sunday is a<br />\nfavorite night for concerts, opera and the like.<br />\nSunday a week ago I heard the 'Damnation<br />\nof Faust,\"\u2014four soloists, a chorus of 200<br />\nvoices and an orchestra, under the direction<br />\nof Felix Motte, one of the most celebrated<br />\nconductors in Europe,\u2014one has music here<br />\nas never dreamt of. Think of a city the size<br />\nof Baltimore\u2014Munich has just the number of<br />\npeople we have \u2014supporting opera houses at<br />\nevery performances of which, at least 3000 to<br />\n4000 people attend. They have half-a-dozen<br />\nfirst-class theatres. Orchestra and string<br />\nquartet and solo concerts galore. Really it is<br />\nbewildering when one attempts to choose a<br />\nplace for an evening's entertainment, since<br />\nthe array of desirables is so great. In Baltimore, opera and Boston Symphony concerts<br />\nare looked forward to as one does to Christmas.<br />\nTuesday night I heard Schuman-Heink.<br />\nThe last time she appeared in Baltimore I<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nmissed her and this time I determined to<br />\nmake good the opportunity. We have reduced prices at the theatres and main concerts,<br />\nso for 25 cents I was admitted. She sang<br />\nwonderfully well and is loved not only for her<br />\nvoice, but also her simple hearted impulsiveness. After her final selection had been sung<br />\na wild burst of enthusiasm broke forth. With<br />\ntheir hand-clappingsand bravos they crowded<br />\nto the stage. Of course, I was up front. At<br />\nlast she did give an encore, and as she was<br />\nleaving the stage, I being very close, called<br />\nfor, \"Sweet Thoughts of Home,\" that being<br />\nthe name of a song I once heard her sing in<br />\nBaltimore. She smiled at me and putting her<br />\nhand to her breast, said in English, \"I only<br />\nwish\"\u2014and was lost in the crowd.<br />\nLast Sunday afternoon I went to hear<br />\n\"Tristan and Tsaede\" Wagner's opera, and<br />\nto be more able to fully understand it, I spent<br />\nSaturday afternoon and evening reading the<br />\nstory in German and the explanation of the<br />\nmusic. The opera house was crowded, some<br />\n3000-4000. It was a rather curious sight to<br />\nwatch the promenade of beautifully gowned<br />\nladies and the military men in their brilliant<br />\nuniforms. Of course, Germany is all military<br />\nand the way the officers strut about makes<br />\none feel that he has no right to be living anyway.<br />\nIt is most marvelous when one considers<br />\nGermany's military equipment. It is strange<br />\nthat a country no larger than New York and<br />\nPennsylvania should have a standing army of<br />\n100,000 and more, and that in 24 hours she<br />\ncould have one million men in the field.<br /><br />\n[THE END.]<br />\n()<br />\nTHE HARE'S FOOT CLUB.<br />\nThe Executive Committee of the Hare's<br />\nFoot Club held a meeting on December 6th,<br />\nand decided definitely to produce '`The<br />\nMagistrate,\" a farcial comedy in three acts,<br />\nat Albaugh's Theatre, on the evenings of<br />\nFebruary 16th and 17th. The play is one of<br />\nthe most popular pieces of Arthur Wing<br />\nPiller\u00b0, the well-known English play-writer,<br />\nand like all his comedies has a plot that is not<br />\nlike the usual farce; its dialogue is clever and<br />\nand the action and fun continuous. It was<br />\nstarred several years ago by Ada Rehan and<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nJohn Drew, but has never been presented in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nRehearsals have already started and parts<br />\nhave been assigned. The cast includes:<br />\nOwens, Woods, Haynes, Weems, Lee, Stollenwerck, Merrick, Smith, Guerard, Hayne,<br />\nMichael, Waters, Fulton, Bosley, McCabe,<br />\nGoddard and Buckler. The ladies of the<br />\ncompany are: \"Misses\" Weems, Lee, Smith<br />\nand Merrick. The fellows are working hard,<br />\nand a production that we can all be justly<br />\nproud of is assured. Professor Philip Ogden,<br />\nthe Club's Honorary President, is taking an<br />\nactive interest in the rehearsals and his efforts<br />\nare being valuable.<br />\nThe charity which is to divide with the<br />\nHomewood Building Fund the profits of the<br />\nperformances has not as yet been selected,<br />\nand suggestions for this will gladly be received by the Executive Committee.<br /><br />\nDEBATE.<br />\nA radical change has been made this year<br />\nin the preparations for both university and<br />\nclass debates. The three-year agreement<br />\nwith Virginia having expired, arrangements<br />\nhave been made to debate Washington and<br />\nLee University, on April 23rd, in Baltimore.<br />\nA return contest at Lexington, has also been<br />\nagreed upon. The subject for the debate<br />\nwill be:<br />\nResolved, That o u r national legislation<br />\nshould be shaped toward a gradual abolition<br />\nof the protective tariff.<br />\nThe annual preliminary debate will not be<br />\na \"class\" debate this year, as the small size<br />\nof the junior class precludes this. Consequently, places on both teams will be open to<br />\nevery undergraduate student who has taken,<br />\nor is taking, Forensies 2. The subject will<br />\nbe the same as that of the 'Varsity debate.<br />\nThe teams will be composed, as in former<br />\nyears, of five members\u2014three speakers, an<br />\nalternate and an adviser. The Adams prizes<br />\n(books, valued at twenty dollars, to each<br />\nspeaker) will be awarded as usual.<br />\nThe public speaking contest for sophomores<br />\nwill take place as usual.<br /><br />\nAMERICAN ASSOCIATION.<br />\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science, held its sixtieth annual<br />\nmeeting here during the holidays.

He came of a wealthy<br />\nfamily, and, since all of his near relatives<br />\nwere dead, was possessed of a fortune large<br />\nenough to make work unnecessary for the<br />\nrest of his life. Nevertheless, he prosecuted<br />\nhis studies as earnestly as I, who contemplated<br />\nentering upon a medical career. His favorite<br />\nsubjects were the exact sciences, especially<br />\nchemistry and physics, and, strangely enough,<br />\nhe was rather inclined towards occultism.<br />\nSo much I knew from hearsay during the<br />\nfirst term of our college life; I became better<br />\nacquainted with him through an accident. I<br />\nhad often seen him working in the laboratory,<br />\nand wondered who the tall, handsome man,<br />\nwith the dark face and piercing gray eyes,<br />\nmight be. Late one day, we were working<br />\nafter the rest had left,\u2014I, anxious to finish a<br />\nprescribed experiment; he, I suppose, dabbling in something of his own. Suddenly I<br />\nheard a loud report, the peculiar crackling hiss<br />\nof cold water and hot glass, and exclamations<br />\nof anger and pain from his part of the room.<br />\nI left my work, and, going to him, found his<br />\nhand badly cut and his apparatus in ruins. I<br />\noffered to bind up the wound, and, while<br />\ndoing so, asked what had happened. A retort,<br />\nhad exploded, he said, while he was experimenting with \"ether and other things.\"<br />\n\"Why were you doing that?\" I asked;<br />\nrather rudely, perhaps.<br />\n\"For my own amusement. Very neatly<br />\ndone, Doctor, thank you;\" and he looked<br />\nthrough me with those unfathomable gray<br />\neyes.<br />\nFrom this incident arose acqaintance, friendship, then intimacy. I found him interesting,<br />\nand well-read on all subjects. He, I believe,<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nused me, with my practicality, as a foil to<br />\nhis own idealism. At bottom, our natures<br />\nwere antipodal, but on the surface we agreed<br />\nvery well; for our minds ran in the same<br />\nchannels, even when we were at variance.<br />\nWe studied together, confided our plans to<br />\none another, and, when we were graduated,<br />\nhad become inseparable. During my medical<br />\ncourse (he was then a graduate student in<br />\nchemistry), I saw him often, and, when<br />\nfinally I opened an office, he procured apartments in a nearby street, and we spent much<br />\ntime together.<br />\nDuring all this time he had said little concerning his belief in the occult, and I supposed he had outgrown it. One evening,<br />\nhowever, I went over to his house to borrow<br />\na book on the history of Germany in the<br />\nMiddle Ages. John, his servant, showed me<br />\ninto the laboratory.<br />\nThe laboratory was the room where Randolph practically lived. It was a long apartment, divided into two parts by a double<br />\ndoor. The smaller, at the far end, was the<br />\nlaboratory proper, with a long working-table,<br />\nand shelves of reagents and apparatus. The<br />\nlarger part of the room was a well-furnished<br />\nlibrary, filled with the oldest and newest of<br />\nbooks.<br />\nMy friend welcomed me, led me to the<br />\ncentral table, and lighted the lamp. I sat<br />\ndown in one easy-chair; he, after lighting<br />\npipes, in another, and thus we sat smoking in<br />\nsilence. I always waited for him to begin to<br />\ntalk; this evening he was unusually quiet.<br />\nAt the end of five minutes be took the pipe<br />\nfrom his mouth and said:<br />\n'Doc, what is time?\"<br />\n\"Half-past nine,\" I replied, looking at him<br />\nin surprise. \"What is the matter with your<br />\nwatch?''<br />\n\"No, not the time; what is time, time is<br />\ngeneral?'' I stared at him in amazement.<br />\n\"I merely wanted your ideas on the subject,\" he continued. \"A traveler ought to<br />\nknow something of the places he visits. I<br />\nshould like to take a trip through time.\"<br />\n\"Henry, Henry,\" said I laughing, \"have<br />\nyou gone back to those foolish ideas of your<br />\ncollege days? . But I suppose there is something in you that must come out; so let us<br />\nhave it. The sooner the better.\"<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"Have I ever told you of my soul-theory?<br />\nDo not groan, I shall not burden you with all<br />\nof it now. Suffice it to say that I am firm in<br />\nthe belief that the soul is linked mysteriously<br />\nwith the body\u2014physically, of course. By the<br />\nsoul I mean the reasoning part of man, the<br />\nsensibilities, and the will,\u2014all that distinguishes him from the brute. This soul is<br />\ncomposed of atomic elements just as the body<br />\nis. These soul-elements are transmitted in<br />\nvarying combinations to the offspring by the<br />\nparents in just the same way as the bodyelements.<br />\nThey constitute the basis of<br />\nheredity, instinct, and so on, corresponding<br />\nto physical resemblance and similarity. Death<br />\nis a complete disintegration of the soul; followed by decay, the disintegration of the<br />\nbody. Since both soul and body are thus<br />\nresolved into their elements, or, more correctly, elementary combinations, the one is no<br />\nmore immortal than the other. That is my<br />\nbelief in a nutshell.\"<br />\n\"You are an atheistic dreamer.\"<br />\n\"You are a superstitious bigot. Now to<br />\nthe case in point, my friend went on. \"I<br />\nsuspect that there is a relation between all<br />\nthe so-called elements, physical and spiritual.<br />\nThey must be merely variations of a primitive<br />\nsubstance which can exist only in the<br />\ninfinite.\"<br />\n\"Explain,\" said I, \"I must confess, I<br />\ndon't quite understand.\"<br />\n'`I mean that, if a human being (body and<br />\nsoul) could be reduced to this primitive state,<br />\nduring such a process he would be outside of<br />\nspace and time, and could return to the sphere<br />\nof this universe, in any place or time he<br />\nchose, in exactly the same condition in<br />\nwhich he left it.' I remembered that sentence later.<br />\nRandolph smoked for a few moments in<br />\nsilence; then he continued: ''Who knows but<br />\nthat I may be some mysterious person in the<br />\nbygone ages; for instance, the Man in the<br />\nIron Mask or the soothsayer that warned<br />\nCLesar? Why should not either one of them<br />\nhave been some traveler from the past or the<br />\nfuture?\"<br />\n'Quite possible. But listen, Henry. Suppose that you should go back a couple of<br />\nhundreds or thousands of years; and that you<br />\nwere in a position to change history. I mean<br /><br />\nthis: that if a certain event, such as the murder of Cesar, were set down in history, and<br />\nyou should go to Cesar and warn him: and<br />\nhe should save himself, thus belying history<br />\n\u2014what then?'<br />\n\"That is a wonderful question. I have<br />\noften thought of it and would give worlds to<br />\nmake the experiment. Change history?\"<br />\nAnd he fell into a reverie.<br />\n\"It merely proves,\" said I, triumphantly,<br />\n'that the hypothesis that you can go back in<br />\ntime is unsound. Your subsequent reasoning<br />\nis flawless, yet the result if absurd; ergo, your<br />\nhypothesis is false. My 'Logic and Philosophy' taught me that much, if yours did not.<br />\nWhy did you go to college, anyway, Henry?\u2014<br />\n\"'There are more things in heaven and<br />\nearth than are dreamed of in your philosophy'.\"<br />\n\"To be serious again,\" said I, after a pause.<br />\n\"If your body and soul are disintegrated,<br />\nwhat is there left to direct your actions out in<br />\nthe infinite?\"<br />\n'That remains to be seen; there lies the<br />\nonly doubtful part of my theory. I think<br />\nthere is a vital principle, independent of soul<br />\nand body, which is eternal and indestructible.<br />\nIt is a part of a great whole, the 'ethereal<br />\nquintessence of Heaven,' if you will, and<br />\nmanifests itself in all organisms. It may be<br />\ntermed Life; taken in the aggregate, you may<br />\ncall it\u2014God.\"<br />\n'You are not sure of this, then?' I asked,<br />\na little sarcastically.<br />\n\"I am sure of nothing, but this is the most<br />\nuncertain.\"<br />\n\"You had better have a care, then, before<br />\nyou make an irretrievable step,\" I said, half<br />\njoking.<br />\n\"It is worth the chance,\" said he, as a faraway look came into the deep gray eyes.<br />\n\"This is all theory,\" said I, after another<br />\npause; \"have V ou any idea of the practical<br />\nside of the affair?\"<br />\n\"Only a little; but I am making progress.<br />\nI nearly killed myself yesterday by another<br />\nexplosion.\"<br />\n\"Henry, Henry, have a care,\" I said, with<br />\nreal anxiety for my friend's welfare. \"Let<br />\nthis foolish business alone.

'Here's your transfer,<br />\nmadam,\" he called, giving the old woman a<br />\nticket, while the motorman impatiently<br />\nclanged his bell.<br />\nThe car started, the conductor growled<br />\naudibly, \"Five cents out for me,\" and the<br />\nincident was apparently closed, except perhaps for the whispers and approving glances<br />\ndirected towards the conductor by several<br />\nold ladies.<br />\nAt the next corner, fifteen persons boarded<br />\nthe car. The conductor pushed his way forward to collect the fares. The sharp tinkle<br />\nof the register pleased me, and I idly counted<br />\nthe strokes.

M. C. A. Cross<br /><br />\nCountry Run on New Year's day was the<br />\nlargest ever held in this section of the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nThirty-eight men were entered, representing the Washington Y. M. C. A., Philadelphia Y. M. C. A., Baltimore Cross Country<br />\nClub, Bloomingdale Athletic Club, McCulloh<br />\nAthletic Club, George Washington University,<br />\nWashington and Lee, and Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nThe members of our team\u2014<br /><br />\nBreyer, Griffith, Reeside, Russell, Wolfe and<br />\nStockett\u2014had been training for several weeks,<br />\nand all were in good condition for the tenmile grind.<br />\nThe course started at the Washington monument, and, after a mile loop, continued<br />\nacross the Potomac into Virginia, and then<br />\nback again, ending at the monument. The<br />\nroads were frozen hard and in a fairly good<br />\ncondition.<br />\nEvery one knows the result of the race,<br />\nthat the banner went to Hopkins, and Griffith,<br />\na scratch man, finished second, with the best<br />\ntime, 57 minutes, 33 seconds. The only<br />\nthing that marred the success of the run was<br />\nthe raw deal given to Hopkins in the matter<br /><br />\nof handicaps. A single example of this will<br />\nshow how the team was treated.<br />\nIt will be remembered that, in the Cross<br />\nCountry Club Run held this fall, Cannon of<br />\nthat club finished third; Reeside, eighth;<br />\nRussell, tenth; and Stockett, fourteenth. In<br />\nthe run on New Year's day Cannon was<br />\njustly given three minutes, but Reeside was<br />\ngiven only one minute and thirty seconds; Russell, thirty seconds,. Wolfe, one minute and<br />\nfifteen seconds; and Stockett,forty-five seconds!<br />\nOur men went into the run with certain defeat<br />\nstaring them in the face, but with hard running they carried off the banner from the<br />\nWashington Y. M. C. A. by the score of<br />\n53 to 63.<br />\nIt is useless to go into details. Suffice it to<br />\nsay that the actual time of the winner, J. P.<br />\nFleming, of George Washington University,<br />\ncounting his handicap of four minutes and<br />\nforty-five seconds, was sixty-six minutes and<br />\nfifteen seconds.<br />\nThe actual time of the Hopkins team,<br />\ncounting the handicaps, was as follows:<br />\nGriffith, 57.33.<br />\nBreyer, 62.48.<br />\nRussell, 64.10.<br />\nReeside, 64.30.<br />\nWolfe, 64.59.<br />\nStockett, 65.46.<br />\nIf just handicaps had been given our men,<br />\nsay four minutes and forty-five seconds to<br />\nStockett, four minutes to Wolfe, and three<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nminutes and a half to Russell and Reeside,<br />\nall of our team would have finished among<br />\nthe first ten, and the run would have been a<br />\nwalkover for Hopkins. As it was, the Johns<br />\nHopkins team brought home the banner, a<br />\ncup, and six bronze medals, the last being<br />\ngiven for finishing within a certain time limit.<br /><br />\nNext Saturday evening (January 16th) the<br />\nannual Sophomore-Freshman Track Meet will<br />\nbe held in the cage.

The<br />\nsophomore team will consist of Tappan<br />\n(captain), Stollenwerck, Makel, Burgan,<br />\nMcCabe, Charles Tilghman, Wolfe, Musser<br />\nand others; while the honor of 1912 will he<br />\ndefended by Fulton (captain), Martin, Lawton, Todes, Carroll, Abel, Haynes, Stewart,<br />\nLurman, Paulus and Brown.<br /><br />\ndents is as 1 to 3%, a figure which puts Hopkins ahead of all other American institutions<br />\nin this respect.<br />\nThe courses actually given, excluding the<br />\nMedical School, and not counting laboratory<br />\nwork, number 237, or about one to every<br />\nstudent and a half, a proportion which is<br />\nprobably far beyond all other universities.<br />\nThe students are residents of forty states,<br />\none territory and the District of Columbia,<br />\nand of six foreign countries.<br /><br />\nRROW<br /><br />\nELME() SHRUNK<br /><br />\nQUARTER SIZE<br /><br />\nC 0 L LAKS<br />\nThey neither shrink, scratch,<br />\n15c.-2 for 25c.<br />\nsaw nor stretch<br />\nCluett,Peabody clz Co., Troy, N.Y.<br /><br />\n0<br />\nA FEW FIGURES.<br />\nAccording to the new Preliminary Register<br />\nof the university, which appeared just before<br />\nChristmas, the enrollment this year is 707, an<br />\nincrease of 24 over last year.
