His talk was the second<br />\nof this year's Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium on the<br />\ntopic of \"Terrorism: Implications for a free society.\"<br />\nTurner, who directed the<br />\nCIA during the Carter Administration, suggested five<br />\nspecific measures as a first step<br />\nin countering the growing<br />\nthreat of terrorism to Americans at home and abroad.<br />\nHe said, \"I'm reasonably optimistic that we can reduce the<br />\nnumber of terrorist attacks by<br />\nimproving U.S. intelligence of<br />\nterrorist activities, pressuring<br />\nother countries to improve their<br />\nsurveillance of local terrorist<br />\ngroups, fortifying American<br />\nembassies and installations<br />\noverseas, pulling out of particularly dangerous countries<br />\naltogether, and not panicking<br />\nor overreacting when crises do<br />\narise.\"<br />\nDiscussing the need for im-<br />\n<br />\nproved U.S. intelligence gathering, Turner said, \"There are<br />\nessentially two ways to collect<br />\nintelligence: from spies or from<br />\ntechnical devices like satellites<br />\nand bugs. Unfortunately, technical devices are not terribly applicable to terrorism since to a<br />\nsatellite, a truck with a bomb<br />\nlooks just like a truck without<br />\na bomb.<br />\n\"Therefore, we have to rely<br />\nlargely on spies to penetrate terrorist organizations. So improving our network of human<br />\nintelligence gathering on terrorist activities should be a<br />\nlarger concern.\"<br />\nTurner suggested, however,<br />\nthat an even more effective<br />\nmeans of terrorism prevention<br />\nwould be to encourage other<br />\nnations to step up efforts to<br />\ncontrol terrorists in their own<br />\ncountries.\"We must insist that<br />\nlocals abroad work on it too,<br />\nsince after all, they are in a<br />\nmuch better situation to deal<br />\nwith their own people, customs,<br />\nand languages.\"<br />\nTurner added that improving<br />\nthe physical protection of<br />\nAmerican installations abroad<br />\nshould be continued too.

We need better physical<br />\nsecurity and barriers around all<br />\nAmerican compounds, especially those in hazardous<br />\ncountries.\"<br />\n\"An even better response,\"<br />\ncontinued Turner, \"would be<br />\nto pull out our American<br />\npresence entirely from countries<br />\nlike Lebanon with a history of<br />\nterrorist attacks against<br />\nAmericans and an inability or<br />\nan unwillingness of local<br />\ngovernments to provide adequate security support, and<br />\nmove our people to a nearby<br />\nrelatively safe city like Cyprus.<br />\n\"Such a move would be very<br />\ninconvenient to Lebanese<br />\ndiplomats, and certainly we<br />\ndon't want to be out of<br />\nLebanon, but the safety of our<br />\nNews & Information<br />\npeople should be our overriding<br />\nStansfield Turner<br />\nconcern.

However, the<br />\nphotography editors took it<br />\nupon themselves to counterbalance what they perceived as<br />\nthe 'liberal anti-Reagan' slant<br />\nof the News-Letter. This 'decision' was based on the fact that<br />\nthere were a number of antiReagan cartoons in recent<br />\nissues. The result was the<br />\nReagan-Bush ad (endorsement?)in the campus notes section. This advertisement may<br />\nwell have been illegal on a<br />\nnumber of grounds: The campaign logo is copyrighted,<br />\ntherefore someone may be<br />\nliable for copyright infringement; secondly, the unpaid<br />\nadvertisement may have<br />\nviolated federal election laws.<br />\nI was aware of these problems, and expressed my<br />\ndissatisfaction with the advertisement to the News-Letter<br />\neditorial board and Director of<br />\nStudent Activities.

The<br />\nReagan administration talked<br />\nof phasing out the Ethiopia aid<br />\ncompletely.<br />\nU.S. food aid to Ethiopia<br />\nrose to about $22 million, or<br />\n41,000 metric tons, last year,<br />\naccording to an AID<br />\nspokesman. Because of the current crisis, the U.S. will more<br />\n\u2022than double those figures in the<br />\n1985 fiscal year.<br />\nBut that doesn't mean the<br />\ngovernment has acted on its<br />\nown initiative. McPherson's<br />\npublic declaration of new support came only two weeks after<br />\nthe administrator told a<br />\nmeeting of dozens of private<br />\norganizations that the situation<br />\nin Ethiopia didn't warrant additional U.S. government<br />\nassistance. Ostensibly, only<br />\n<br />\nMaxwell<br />\n<br />\nlen<br />\nCody<br />\n<br />\nrr<br />\nafter NBC's recent broadcast of<br />\ngrisly BBC footage prompted<br />\nan emotional response from<br />\ntelevision viewers did the<br />\ngovernment loosen its purse<br />\nstrings further.<br />\nMorris, a 43-year-old former<br />\nprogram manager for Motorola<br />\nCorp., bluntly expressed the<br />\nadministration's sentiments last<br />\nsummer. For one, he said, U.S.<br />\nfood shipments to Ethiopia<br />\nwere three times the value of<br />\nsimilar Soviet gifts to all of subSaharan Africa.<br />\nMorris added that the Ethiopian government, which wastes<br />\nalmost half its resources on a<br />\nmilitary embroiled in civil war,<br />\nhad until recently made hunger<br />\nassistance a low priority. His<br />\ncontentions were reinforced by<br />\nreports last week that the Ethiopians had imported $4 million<br />\nworth of Scotch whiskey to, according to an Ehtiopian<br />\ndiplomat, \"fight the black<br />\nmarket and to spare the people.\" Outside observers said the<br />\n<br />\nz<br />\n\u2022 Arr,,.<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nC.<br />\n<br />\n%<br />\nCoNege Press Service<br />\n<br />\nshipment would have coincided<br />\nwith the regime's 10th anniversary celebrations.<br />\n\"It isn't their ideology that<br />\nbothers us,\" Morris said. \"It's<br />\ntheir behavior.\"<br />\nUntil recently, at least, Congress felt similarly. It could<br />\nhave sustained Carter's last<br />\nlevel of aid, but didn't. And<br />\nthis year it failed to pass proposals of Rep.

Clearly, when they shift their focus<br />\nfrom presidential politics to<br />\nhuman tragedy, the media are<br />\npowerful humanitarian tool.<br />\nNow that the U.S. has turned its attention to an emergency 11 years in the making, it<br />\ncould make the difference for<br />\nsome, if not all, of the hungry.<br />\nSo many stomachs should not<br />\nhave gone empty in the first<br />\nplace.<br />\nCopyright 1984<br />\nNews Group Chicago, Inc.<br />\nNews America Syndicate<br />\n<br />\nLetters continued<br />\nContinued from Page 6<br />\nthrough a number of communications with the NewsLetter staff, was given the<br />\nstrong impression that equal<br />\ntime for the Democratic ticket<br />\nwould be given in last week's<br />\nissue.

However, no<br />\nHopkins publication, particularly the only widely<br />\ndistributed (and widely read)<br />\ncampus newspaper, has carte<br />\nblanche to do whatever it<br />\npleases, especially something as<br />\npoorly timed as this. Students<br />\nof all political persuasions were<br />\nsurprised by the advertisement;<br />\nmany were outraged at what<br />\nthey viewed as a News-Letter<br />\nendorsement of the Republican<br />\nticket. I am personally disappointed that the editors, having<br />\nthe chance to redress the situation, failed to do so. This<br />\nreduces the credibility and nonpartisan nature of the publication in general.

I am sure you<br />\ncan appreciate my shock and<br />\nsurprise at discovering that<br />\n\"Reagan-Bush '84\" advertisement in the Campus Notes section two weeks ago.<br />\nDue to the obvious legal<br />\novertones of this apparent endorsement, instead of writing to<br />\nyou, I aired my disdain to<br />\nmembers of the Young<br />\nDemocrats and to the S.A.C.<br />\nExecutive Board.

In this way, it continues the fine tradition of<br />\nMickey Spillane (Yes, Mickey<br />\nSpillane; he's better than the<br />\nTV show Mike Hammer) and<br />\nRaymond Chandler. But unlike<br />\nmost books in this genre, he examines themes that are contemporary, touching, and often<br />\ndepressing. This combination<br />\nof thrills and thought makes<br />\nthis book compelling and<br />\nreadable.<br />\nThe hero of this book, Milo<br />\nMilodragovitch, is not your<br />\neveryday hero. His faults<br />\nnumber far too many to be<br />\ncounted offhand. He had quit<br />\nhis private investigator work,<br />\nand gotten a job with a security company where he sits and<br />\nhides outside gas stations to<br />\ncatch burglars. He spends the<br />\nrest of his time drinking, snorting cocaine, and paying<br />\nalimony to a string of ex-wives.<br />\nSuddenly, he gets a letter telling him that someone would<br />\n<br />\n-A-taut, stirring, highly ori9in,ol<br />\n\"t\u2022if<br />\n<br />\nlike to hire him as an Investigator. The mysterious<br />\nclient is an older woman who<br />\nhad been his father's mistress<br />\nwhen he was a boy. She asks<br />\nhim to follow a young couple<br />\nwho have a weekly tryst outside<br />\nher window. In her old age,she<br />\n<br />\nP14.;LADEPHit,<br />\n<br />\nnas become a busybody and<br />\njust wants to find out who these<br />\npeople are. In a weird coincidence, the woman she wants<br />\nhim to follow turns out to be<br />\nthe same woman he's following<br />\nfor work. While he is following<br />\nthe man, Milo sees him die. As<br />\n<br />\nhe searches the car, he finds<br />\nmunitions, a kilo of grass, and<br />\na bag of very pure cocaine.<br />\nIf you can believe it, things,<br />\nmanage to get crazier from<br />\nhere. But it's a tribute to Mr.<br />\nCrumley's writing that one<br />\nnever doubts that this is a possible, if not probable, scenario;<br />\nand fiction is rarely about the<br />\nmundane and probable. The<br />\nplot alone is interesting and the<br />\nwriting style carries us through<br />\nall the twists well enough for<br />\nthe book to be enjoyable based<br />\npurely on the plot.<br />\nHowever, there's more to<br />\nthis book than the plot twists<br />\n(which this reviewer, you may<br />\nhave noticed, has carefully<br />\navoided telling you about. Do<br />\nyou want me to tell you<br />\neverything?!) In the course of<br />\nthe book, Milo manages to<br />\nthink about many of the questions that this kind of book<br />\nnormally strives to avoid. From<br />\nthe first chapter, where Milo<br />\nthinks about the legacy of the<br />\nMidwest, to the last, where he<br />\ncontemplates who has responsibility for world problems, the<br />\nthemes are developed in ways<br />\nthat make you think.<br />\nIt is this way of presenting<br />\nMilo as a character who thinks<br />\nsimply about deep questions<br />\nthat makes all the fantastic happenings believable. Though we<br />\nrarely find people who find a<br />\ncache of drugs and munitions,<br />\nwe know a lot of people like<br />\n<br />\nMilo. Our world may not be<br />\nfilled with the other characters<br />\nand events, but we know that if<br />\nwe were put into the same situations, we'd do the same things.<br />\nBoth bad and noble things are<br />\ndone because they must be<br />\ndone. The themes are taken up<br />\nbecause they are thrust on<br />\nMilo. That's why the book is so<br />\nbelievable.<br />\nEither one of these elements,<br />\nplot or style, is normally<br />\n<br />\nAuthor James Crowley<br />\n<br />\nenough to get us to read a<br />\nbook.

The<br />\nalbum is a decent hardcore<br />\npunk sampler featuring songs<br />\nby Black Flag, the Circle Jerks,<br />\nand Suicidal Tendencies; in<br />\nfact, the album is responsible<br />\nfor popularizing (in a strict cult<br />\nsense) Suicidal Tendencies'<br />\nclassic song, \"Institutionalized.\" Thus, I assumed that this<br />\nwould be some sort of punk<br />\nrock movie. It's not really;<br />\npunk is just one element of its<br />\nmadness. That much is<br />\nrelegated to the first fifteen<br />\nminutes or so of this movie,<br />\n<br />\nshowing main character Otto's<br />\nnatural punk element. In fact,<br />\nthe movie takes the somewhat<br />\nnaive and cliched view that all<br />\npunk rockers are criminal,<br />\nthough this can easily be<br />\nforgiven, since it's used to great<br />\neffect. Anyway, hardcore fans<br />\nwon't be disappointed, if solely for the hilarious cameo appearance by the Circle Jerks.<br />\nRepo man is probably the<br />\nfirst movie directly inspired by<br />\nWeekly World News. Its plot<br />\ngoes somewhat like this: Otto,<br />\nan LA punk rocker (played<br />\nquite convincingly by Emilio<br />\nEstevez, the son of Martin<br />\nSheen) gets indoctrinated into<br />\nthe world of car repossesion by<br />\nBud, a veteran repo man<br />\n(Harry Dean Stanton.) At the<br />\nsame time there's a Chevy<br />\n<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix<br />\n<br />\nLIQUID SKY<br />\nthe<br />\nelaborate story<br />\nabout a girl<br />\nfrom Connecticut<br />\nFRIDAY & SATURDAY<br />\n7 9 & 11pm<br />\nSHRIVER<br />\n<br />\nSenior Class Film Series<br />\nAt*<br />\n<br />\nafoSosa ,ItyCiimht Ilesio\u2022\u202244<br />\n<br />\nLisps*<br />\nopt out ha'the<br />\nloasioot olovb<br />\nabout<br />\nweer=1\u2022P<br />\n<br />\nPOMO<br />\n1INIS Mipsripsermi<br />\n<br />\nAlso showing BUGS BUNNY<br />\n<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nNov 16 & 17<br />\n<br />\n7:00 9:00 & 11:00<br />\n<br />\nMalibu with aliens in its trunk<br />\nbeing driven around LA, which<br />\na secret government agency<br />\n(though that's really not made<br />\nclear) will go to any lengths to<br />\nget. Thus, a $20,000 reward is<br />\noffered for its recovery. This of<br />\ncourse gets to the repo men,<br />\nand they spend the rest of the<br />\nmovie trying to get the Malibu.<br />\nBut plot is probably about as<br />\nimportant in this movie as it<br />\nwas in a movie like Airplane!In<br />\nfact, there hasn't been a movie<br />\nsince Airplane! in which you<br />\nhave had to pay so much attention to what's going on in the<br />\nbackground. What makes this<br />\nmovie great is its complete irreverence coupled with a lot of<br />\nsensible thinking; it quite nicely avoids the problems of<br />\npreachiness, the downfall of<br />\nmany an independent movie,<br />\nand complete weirdness. The<br />\nmovie isn't so bizarre that you<br />\ncan't figure out what's going<br />\non.<br />\nFurthermore, Repo Man is<br />\nremarkable in the way in which<br />\nthe distinctions between reality<br />\nand un-reality are blurred. I<br />\nmentioned Weekly World<br />\nNews\u2014that's the world in<br />\nwhich this movie is based: a<br />\nworld of UFO's, time<br />\nmachines, and evil punk<br />\nrockers. The movie slips effortlessly from the bizarre to<br />\nthe realistic, from the<br />\npsychedelic world of Otto's<br />\nparents' house, ruled by an omnipotent TV evangelist, to the<br />\nvery real relationships between<br />\n<br />\nOtto and his repo man mentors.<br />\nSometimes there are blanks in<br />\nthe guns, sometimes there are<br />\nreal bullets. Yet ultimately you<br />\nare left with the impression that<br />\nmaybe things aren't so unreal<br />\nafter all. At on point, the<br />\ndriver of the Malibu (Fox Harris) describes in vowing detail<br />\nthe effects of the neut.=<br />\nbomb. At first you laugh, but<br />\nthen you realize\u2014hey, the<br />\nneutron bomb is for real. At<br />\nanother point, there is a scene<br />\nso violent that you have to<br />\nlaugh at the overkill until you<br />\nremember that less than two<br />\nblocks away from a lot of us a<br />\nwoman was raped, savagely<br />\nbeaten, and almost set on fire.<br />\nMaybe the real world isn't as<br />\nreal as we imagine it is. And<br />\nthrough it all there is one<br />\ncharacter, the idiot/sage/hero,<br />\nMiller, played by Tracey<br />\nWalter, who seems to straddle<br />\nthis line\u2014he's the WWN<br />\nembodied.<br />\nAt one point in this movie<br />\nBud says something to the effect of \"Ordinary fucking<br />\npeople\u2014I hate 'em... the ordinary person spends his whole<br />\nlife trying to get out of tense<br />\nsituations.

Everybody is out to prove that this is a solid club.\"<br />\nWith only one starter among the seven returnees<br />\nfrom last year's varsity squad and no freshman<br />\nrecruits, the hoopsters may have difficulty maturing<br />\nas a team.<br />\nStill, Coach Doherty feels that the team has many<br />\nstrong points. \"We have an abundance of 6'2\" and<br />\n6'3\" players and we're much quicker this year than<br />\nlast,\" he said. \"We'll be out to exploit our advantages<br />\nby being more daring on defense. We'll gamble more<br />\nbecause of our quickness, look to the fastbreak outlet<br />\npasses and also press more.\"<br />\nThe close games will be the critical ones for the Jays<br />\nthis year if they do hope to finish with a winning<br />\nrecord. Last year, the team was 3-4 in games which<br />\nwere decided by three or less points. Claims Doherty,<br />\n\"Discipline wins the close games and we'll run a more<br />\ndisciplined game plan this year. You have to win the<br />\nclose ones to make the playoffs.\"<br />\nWhile hopes are high for the upcoming season, it<br />\nwould be unfair to expect last year's reserves to quickly<br />\ndevelop into a cohesive starting unit. Doherty admits<br />\nthat the team \"does not have the best talent individually,\" but believes they will do well \"if everybody accepts their role and plays within themselves.\"<br />\nSaid the coach, \"We're an undetermined commodity, but exploitation of our speed, and our desire to win<br />\nand improve on last year will make us more successful.<br />\nWe will play as a unit and be competitive.

Last year Ken averaged 3.3 points per game<br />\nand shot 45% from the field. \"Kenny is the best pure<br />\nshooter on the team, and one of the finest I've ever<br />\ncoached,\" notes coach Nap Doherty. \"He's a good<br />\nleader and we're expecting big things from him this<br />\nseason.\"<br />\n<br />\nMoving up from the JV squad, \"Slick\" is a strong<br />\nrebounder, with much improved shooting and ball<br />\nhandling skills. \"Terry is an aggressive player<br />\nunderneath the basket, and has a nice shooting touch,\"<br />\nCoach Doherty noted. \"With further improvement in<br />\nhis defensive skills, he should see a lot of playing time<br />\nthis year.\"<br />\n<br />\nRalph Horne<br />\nBronx, NY<br />\nCenter<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'8\", 205<br />\n<br />\nCharlie Sikorsky<br />\nClub Hill, MD<br />\nForward<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'4\", 195<br />\n<br />\nAn excellent defensive player and rebound specialist,<br />\nHorne has greatly improved his offensive skills.<br />\n\"Ralph is our defensive stalwart,\" said Doherty. \"As<br />\nthe starting center, I expect him to be a solid double<br />\nfigure scorer, and provide us with the needed rebounds.\" As a sophomore Ralph averaged 2.2 points<br />\nper game, and was second on the team in blocked shots<br />\nwith nine.<br />\n<br />\nSikorsky has vastly improved his overall game since<br />\nlast year, and will be relied upon for strength under<br />\nthe boards. \"Charlie is a real hard worker,\" Doherty<br />\nnoted. \"He's a good open shooter and has the strength<br />\nto get rebounds at both ends of the court.\" As a<br />\nsophomore, Mike finished fourth on the team in field<br />\ngoal percentage, by shooting fifty percent from the<br />\nfield.<br />\n<br />\n* Blue Jay *<br />\n* Profiles *<br />\nby Mike Silverman<br />\nPhotos by Jess Bunshaft<br />\n<br />\nMike Kowatch<br />\nBaltimore, MD<br />\nGuard<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'2\", 160<br />\n<br />\nEd Doherty<br />\nHead Coach<br />\n<br />\nA good shooter with excellent speed and leaping<br />\nability, Kowatch isompected to play an integral part<br />\non this year's Hopkins team. \"Mike looks more relaxed on the court this year,\" says Doherty.\"He has improved his shooting, and I expect him to see a lot of<br />\nplaying time this season.\" As a sophomore, Mike<br />\naveraged 2.2 points per game, and had 19 assists.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Ed \"Nappy\" Doherty is entering his fourth<br />\nseason at Hopkins.

The loss<br />\ndropped the Blue Jays' record<br />\nto 7-8-2.<br />\nThe game, played at<br />\nSalisbury State, was a semifinal matchup in the Maryland<br />\nState Tournment. Hopkins<br />\nknocked off the Green Terrors<br />\nof Western Maryland to advance to this round. The<br />\nbooters were riding a fourgame winning streak, but<br />\nwere unable to push it to<br />\nfive.<br />\n.<br />\nAfter a three hour van ride to<br />\nSalisbury, the Jays were greeted<br />\nwith a goal by Seagull Paul<br />\nMousec only three minutes into the match.<br />\n\"We came out sluggish,\"<br />\nsaid junior midfielder Rob Nardino. \"We were a little<br />\nunorganized and they caught us<br />\noff guard. The early goal kind<br />\nof demoralized us, knd we<br />\nnever settled into our game.\"<br />\nSalisbury State showed up<br />\nready to play, while Hopkins<br />\nappeared tentative. Some intensity was lacking, and, as<br />\nfreshman standout Steve Gallo<br />\nput it, \"We weren't tackling<br />\nhard.\"<br />\nSalisbury kept penetrating<br />\nthrough the Jay defense, and<br />\nthe Seagulls scored again ten<br />\nmunutes before halftime on a<br />\nheader by Mike Orlowski.<br />\nSalisbury outshot Hopkins 8-3<br />\nin the first half, and they held<br />\na 2-0 lead at the intermission.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were playing<br />\nwithout the services of junior<br />\nDave Gallo, Steve's brother<br />\nand one of the team's top offensive threats. Gallo sprained<br />\nhis ankle sliding into the goalie<br />\nimmilmaw<br />\n<br />\nJunior Rob Nardino was one of the Jays top assistmen this season.<br />\n<br />\nin Hopkins' game against Gettysburg last week. According to<br />\nNardino, \"not having Dave in<br />\nthere hurt us more than we<br />\nthought it would.\"<br />\n\"Dave's been a spark-plug<br />\nfor us. Offensively, he's been<br />\nhot \u2014 beating people, passing<br />\nand scoring,\" explained captain<br />\nDavid Plaut. \"Our offense<br />\nlooks to Dave and Grenville<br />\nJones on the outside. Without<br />\nDave, the flow of the game was<br />\nvery unbalanced.\"<br />\nIn addition to Gallo's ailment, Nardino injured his<br />\nankle in a collision with the<br />\nSalisbury goalie during the first<br />\nhalf. Although he played the<br />\nrest of the game, he was not at<br />\nfull strength.<br />\nIn the second half, the Jays<br />\ncame out with a different attitude. \"We were a little more<br />\npsyched,\" said Steve Gallo.<br />\n\"We were penetrating, but then<br />\nthey got a goal in the middle of<br />\nthe half.\" The score, at 23:13<br />\nof the second stanza, put<br />\n<br />\nHopkins in a big hole. The Jays<br />\nfound themselves down by<br />\nthree with only twenty minutes<br />\nto play.<br />\nResponding to the apparent<br />\nreluctance of the referee to<br />\nblow his whistle, the Blue Jays<br />\nbegan playing much more<br />\nphysically in the second half.<br />\nAs a result of their increased<br />\naggressiveness, four booters<br />\nwere rewarded with yellow<br />\ncards. Ian Rothrock, Paul<br />\nMiller, Gallo and Jones all<br />\nreceived the bright yellow<br />\npenalty placards.<br />\nHopkins finally got on the<br />\nboard late in the second half as<br />\nfreshman Kevin Flynn scored<br />\non an assist from Plaut. But, as<br />\nSteve Gallo noted, \"it was too<br />\nlittle too late\" for the Jays.<br />\nWith just two minutes left in<br />\nthe game, the referee called<br />\nPlaut for a foul in the penalty<br />\narea. Seagull Eric Tewey converted on the penalty shot,<br />\nmaking the score 4-1 and icing<br />\nthe game for Salisbury.<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\n<br />\nEarly damage<br />\nAfter the game, there was a<br />\nfeeling among the players that<br />\nthe team was never able to undo the damage done by<br />\nSalisbury's quick goal at the<br />\nbeginning of the contest.<br />\n\"When they scored, we were<br />\nstunned,\" Steve Gallo said. \"It<br />\nchanged the whole momentum<br />\nof the game. It took us a long<br />\ntime to get back to our style of<br />\nplay.\"<br />\nGiving up an early goal also<br />\nled to defeat for Hopkins<br />\nearlier in the season, when<br />\nSwarthmore scored on the Jays<br />\nonly 37 seconds into the game.<br />\nThe Quakers went on to top the<br />\nJays 3-0.<br />\nThe Salisbury State contest<br />\nmarked the sixth road loss for<br />\nHopkins in 1984. While the<br />\nbooters finished 5-2-2 at<br />\nHomewood Field, their road<br />\nrecord was a poor 2-6.<br />\nSalisbury State had a grass<br />\nfield, and the Blue Jays went in-<br />\n<br />\nto the contest having played<br />\nthree consecutive games on the<br />\nHopkins artificial turf. As<br />\nNiyogi said,\"We always have<br />\ntrouble going from grass to<br />\nturf.\"<br />\nSteve Gallo agreed. \"Turf is<br />\nflat, and you get regular<br />\nbounces. The grass field we<br />\nplayed on had clumps which<br />\ncaused irregular bounces,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nUnwilling to consider any excuses, Plaut felt that \"the main<br />\nreason we didn't play very well<br />\nwas just because we had an off<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nThe Jays were not happy<br />\nwith the loss, but they were<br />\nsatisfied about their improvement during the course of the<br />\nseason. \"You're always disappointed when you don't win, of<br />\ncourse,\" Niyogi said. \"I don't<br />\nthink we played as well as we<br />\ndid in our previous four<br />\ngames.\"<br />\nHowever, Steve Gallo noted,<br />\n\"the last game wasn't indicative<br />\nof what we were like during the<br />\nlast few weeks or of how much<br />\nwe improved.\"<br />\n\"We've been playing a much<br />\nbetter brand of soccer of late<br />\nthan we showed in this game.<br />\nAgainst Gettysburg we gutted<br />\nout a difficult situation,\" the<br />\ncaptain explained. \"We didn't<br />\nplay poorly against Salisbury<br />\nState; they were a really good<br />\nteam. We just didn't play with<br />\nthe same intensity. There were<br />\nmental lapses that we hadn't<br />\nhad in the last four games. If<br />\nwe had been more intense, it<br />\nwould have been a different<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nThe Jays' caliber of play improved<br />\ntremendously<br />\nthroughout the year.

They<br />\nalso did a great job of shutting<br />\ndown the running attack.<br />\nOn offense, Hopkins struggled a bit, mainly due to a sudden rash of injuries in the first<br />\nhalf. On their second possession of the day, left tackle Joe<br />\nNador went down with a knee<br />\ninjury and had to be helped off<br />\nthe turf.

McLam rushed for 103<br />\nyards in the first quarter alone,<br />\nbut then injured his ankle and<br />\nwas forced to the bench early in<br />\nthe second period.

His talk was the second<br />\nof this year's Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium on the<br />\ntopic of \"Terrorism: Implications for a free society.\"<br />\nTurner, who directed the<br />\nCIA during the Carter Administration, suggested five<br />\nspecific measures as a first step<br />\nin countering the growing<br />\nthreat of terrorism to Americans at home and abroad.<br />\nHe said, \"I'm reasonably optimistic that we can reduce the<br />\nnumber of terrorist attacks by<br />\nimproving U.S. intelligence of<br />\nterrorist activities, pressuring<br />\nother countries to improve their<br />\nsurveillance of local terrorist<br />\ngroups, fortifying American<br />\nembassies and installations<br />\noverseas, pulling out of particularly dangerous countries<br />\naltogether, and not panicking<br />\nor overreacting when crises do<br />\narise.\"<br />\nDiscussing the need for im-<br /><br />\nproved U.S. intelligence gathering, Turner said, \"There are<br />\nessentially two ways to collect<br />\nintelligence: from spies or from<br />\ntechnical devices like satellites<br />\nand bugs. Unfortunately, technical devices are not terribly applicable to terrorism since to a<br />\nsatellite, a truck with a bomb<br />\nlooks just like a truck without<br />\na bomb.<br />\n\"Therefore, we have to rely<br />\nlargely on spies to penetrate terrorist organizations. So improving our network of human<br />\nintelligence gathering on terrorist activities should be a<br />\nlarger concern.\"<br />\nTurner suggested, however,<br />\nthat an even more effective<br />\nmeans of terrorism prevention<br />\nwould be to encourage other<br />\nnations to step up efforts to<br />\ncontrol terrorists in their own<br />\ncountries.\"We must insist that<br />\nlocals abroad work on it too,<br />\nsince after all, they are in a<br />\nmuch better situation to deal<br />\nwith their own people, customs,<br />\nand languages.\"<br />\nTurner added that improving<br />\nthe physical protection of<br />\nAmerican installations abroad<br />\nshould be continued too.

We need better physical<br />\nsecurity and barriers around all<br />\nAmerican compounds, especially those in hazardous<br />\ncountries.\"<br />\n\"An even better response,\"<br />\ncontinued Turner, \"would be<br />\nto pull out our American<br />\npresence entirely from countries<br />\nlike Lebanon with a history of<br />\nterrorist attacks against<br />\nAmericans and an inability or<br />\nan unwillingness of local<br />\ngovernments to provide adequate security support, and<br />\nmove our people to a nearby<br />\nrelatively safe city like Cyprus.<br />\n\"Such a move would be very<br />\ninconvenient to Lebanese<br />\ndiplomats, and certainly we<br />\ndon't want to be out of<br />\nLebanon, but the safety of our<br />\nNews &amp; Information<br />\npeople should be our overriding<br />\nStansfield Turner<br />\nconcern.

This was followed last<br />\nweek by a statement that the<br />\nspace is exclusively for the use<br />\nof the photography editors,<br />\nwho may do whatever they<br />\nwant with the space.<br />\nOf course, this is entirely<br />\nproper\u2014when there are<br />\nphotographs in the spot in<br />\nquestion. However, the<br />\nphotography editors took it<br />\nupon themselves to counterbalance what they perceived as<br />\nthe 'liberal anti-Reagan' slant<br />\nof the News-Letter. This 'decision' was based on the fact that<br />\nthere were a number of antiReagan cartoons in recent<br />\nissues. The result was the<br />\nReagan-Bush ad (endorsement?)in the campus notes section. This advertisement may<br />\nwell have been illegal on a<br />\nnumber of grounds: The campaign logo is copyrighted,<br />\ntherefore someone may be<br />\nliable for copyright infringement; secondly, the unpaid<br />\nadvertisement may have<br />\nviolated federal election laws.<br />\nI was aware of these problems, and expressed my<br />\ndissatisfaction with the advertisement to the News-Letter<br />\neditorial board and Director of<br />\nStudent Activities. I was contacted by a member of the<br />\nMondale campaign, who told<br />\nme that they were considering<br />\nrequesting an injunction to prevent the News-Letter from going to print.

Morris,<br />\nthe No. 2 official at the U.S.<br />\nAgency for International<br />\nDevelopment (AID).<br />\nBut politics has almost<br />\neverything to do with the starvation in Ethiopia that is<br />\nreportedly taking from 100 to<br />\n250 lives per week and, according to the United Nations,<br />\nthreatens as many as 7 million<br />\nof that country's estimated 34<br />\nmillion people. And the U.S.<br />\nholds its share of responsibility.<br />\nLast week's announcement<br />\nby Morris' boss, AID Administrator M. Peter McPherson, of a U.S. decision to ship<br />\nan extra 30,000 metric tons of<br />\ncorn, wheat and other grains to<br />\nEthiopia overstates the enthusiasm of our government for<br />\nhelping that East African nation. Since Ethiopia's last major famine led to the replacement in 1974 of a U.S.-backed<br />\ndictator, Haile Selassie, with<br />\nSoviet-backed Marxists, Congress and every administration<br />\nsince Nixon's have looked<br />\naskance at giving the current<br />\nregime humanitarian assistance<br />\nthat could be construed as a<br />\npolitical endorsement.<br />\nFederal law forbids the U.S.<br />\nfrom providing to Ethiopia<br />\ndevelopmental or long-term<br />\nassistance of any kind. The prohibition went into effect in 1974<br />\nwhen Ethiopia's new government took control of the assets<br />\nof U.S. companies operating<br />\nthere.<br />\nThat left the door open only<br />\nto \"emergency\" food and nonfood assistance for distribution<br />\nthrough private, voluntary<br />\nagencies. Because of its ability<br />\nto move enormous amounts of<br />\ngrain', the federal government<br />\nhas provided the bulk of food<br />\nshipped from the U.S. to<br />\nEthiopia over the years.<br />\nYet, according to an AID<br />\ncompendium, \"U.S. Overseas<br />\nLoans and Grants,\" gifts of<br />\nfood to Ethiopia rose to $15<br />\nmillion in 1980, Jimmy Carter's<br />\nlast year, but then dropped by<br />\ntwo-thirds in 1981. In 1982 and<br /><br />\n1983, U.S. shipments were<br />\nworth $2.5 million and $2.8<br />\nmillion, respectively. The<br />\nReagan administration talked<br />\nof phasing out the Ethiopia aid<br />\ncompletely.<br />\nU.S. food aid to Ethiopia<br />\nrose to about $22 million, or<br />\n41,000 metric tons, last year,<br />\naccording to an AID<br />\nspokesman. Because of the current crisis, the U.S. will more<br />\n\u2022than double those figures in the<br />\n1985 fiscal year.<br />\nBut that doesn't mean the<br />\ngovernment has acted on its<br />\nown initiative. McPherson's<br />\npublic declaration of new support came only two weeks after<br />\nthe administrator told a<br />\nmeeting of dozens of private<br />\norganizations that the situation<br />\nin Ethiopia didn't warrant additional U.S. government<br />\nassistance. Ostensibly, only<br /><br />\nMaxwell<br /><br />\nlen<br />\nCody<br /><br />\nrr<br />\nafter NBC's recent broadcast of<br />\ngrisly BBC footage prompted<br />\nan emotional response from<br />\ntelevision viewers did the<br />\ngovernment loosen its purse<br />\nstrings further.<br />\nMorris, a 43-year-old former<br />\nprogram manager for Motorola<br />\nCorp., bluntly expressed the<br />\nadministration's sentiments last<br />\nsummer. For one, he said, U.S.<br />\nfood shipments to Ethiopia<br />\nwere three times the value of<br />\nsimilar Soviet gifts to all of subSaharan Africa.<br />\nMorris added that the Ethiopian government, which wastes<br />\nalmost half its resources on a<br />\nmilitary embroiled in civil war,<br />\nhad until recently made hunger<br />\nassistance a low priority. His<br />\ncontentions were reinforced by<br />\nreports last week that the Ethiopians had imported $4 million<br />\nworth of Scotch whiskey to, according to an Ehtiopian<br />\ndiplomat, \"fight the black<br />\nmarket and to spare the people.\" Outside observers said the<br /><br />\nz<br />\n\u2022 Arr,,.<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nC.<br /><br />\n%<br />\nCoNege Press Service<br /><br />\nshipment would have coincided<br />\nwith the regime's 10th anniversary celebrations.<br />\n\"It isn't their ideology that<br />\nbothers us,\" Morris said. \"It's<br />\ntheir behavior.\"<br />\nUntil recently, at least, Congress felt similarly. It could<br />\nhave sustained Carter's last<br />\nlevel of aid, but didn't. And<br />\nthis year it failed to pass proposals of Rep.

Clearly, when they shift their focus<br />\nfrom presidential politics to<br />\nhuman tragedy, the media are<br />\npowerful humanitarian tool.<br />\nNow that the U.S. has turned its attention to an emergency 11 years in the making, it<br />\ncould make the difference for<br />\nsome, if not all, of the hungry.<br />\nSo many stomachs should not<br />\nhave gone empty in the first<br />\nplace.<br />\nCopyright 1984<br />\nNews Group Chicago, Inc.<br />\nNews America Syndicate<br /><br />\nLetters continued<br />\nContinued from Page 6<br />\nthrough a number of communications with the NewsLetter staff, was given the<br />\nstrong impression that equal<br />\ntime for the Democratic ticket<br />\nwould be given in last week's<br />\nissue.

I was even asked by the<br />\nNews-Letter for a MondaleFerraro bumper sticker so that<br />\nthey could properly copy the<br />\nlogo.<br />\nInstead, last week's NewsLetter carried the blurb about<br />\nthe space being the sole province of the photography<br />\neditors.

However, no<br />\nHopkins publication, particularly the only widely<br />\ndistributed (and widely read)<br />\ncampus newspaper, has carte<br />\nblanche to do whatever it<br />\npleases, especially something as<br />\npoorly timed as this. Students<br />\nof all political persuasions were<br />\nsurprised by the advertisement;<br />\nmany were outraged at what<br />\nthey viewed as a News-Letter<br />\nendorsement of the Republican<br />\nticket. I am personally disappointed that the editors, having<br />\nthe chance to redress the situation, failed to do so. This<br />\nreduces the credibility and nonpartisan nature of the publication in general.

I am sure you<br />\ncan appreciate my shock and<br />\nsurprise at discovering that<br />\n\"Reagan-Bush '84\" advertisement in the Campus Notes section two weeks ago.<br />\nDue to the obvious legal<br />\novertones of this apparent endorsement, instead of writing to<br />\nyou, I aired my disdain to<br />\nmembers of the Young<br />\nDemocrats and to the S.A.C.<br />\nExecutive Board.

In this way, it continues the fine tradition of<br />\nMickey Spillane (Yes, Mickey<br />\nSpillane; he's better than the<br />\nTV show Mike Hammer) and<br />\nRaymond Chandler. But unlike<br />\nmost books in this genre, he examines themes that are contemporary, touching, and often<br />\ndepressing. This combination<br />\nof thrills and thought makes<br />\nthis book compelling and<br />\nreadable.<br />\nThe hero of this book, Milo<br />\nMilodragovitch, is not your<br />\neveryday hero. His faults<br />\nnumber far too many to be<br />\ncounted offhand. He had quit<br />\nhis private investigator work,<br />\nand gotten a job with a security company where he sits and<br />\nhides outside gas stations to<br />\ncatch burglars. He spends the<br />\nrest of his time drinking, snorting cocaine, and paying<br />\nalimony to a string of ex-wives.<br />\nSuddenly, he gets a letter telling him that someone would<br /><br />\n-A-taut, stirring, highly ori9in,ol<br />\n\"t\u2022if<br /><br />\nlike to hire him as an Investigator. The mysterious<br />\nclient is an older woman who<br />\nhad been his father's mistress<br />\nwhen he was a boy. She asks<br />\nhim to follow a young couple<br />\nwho have a weekly tryst outside<br />\nher window. In her old age,she<br /><br />\nP14.;LADEPHit,<br /><br />\nnas become a busybody and<br />\njust wants to find out who these<br />\npeople are. In a weird coincidence, the woman she wants<br />\nhim to follow turns out to be<br />\nthe same woman he's following<br />\nfor work. While he is following<br />\nthe man, Milo sees him die. As<br /><br />\nhe searches the car, he finds<br />\nmunitions, a kilo of grass, and<br />\na bag of very pure cocaine.<br />\nIf you can believe it, things,<br />\nmanage to get crazier from<br />\nhere. But it's a tribute to Mr.<br />\nCrumley's writing that one<br />\nnever doubts that this is a possible, if not probable, scenario;<br />\nand fiction is rarely about the<br />\nmundane and probable. The<br />\nplot alone is interesting and the<br />\nwriting style carries us through<br />\nall the twists well enough for<br />\nthe book to be enjoyable based<br />\npurely on the plot.<br />\nHowever, there's more to<br />\nthis book than the plot twists<br />\n(which this reviewer, you may<br />\nhave noticed, has carefully<br />\navoided telling you about. Do<br />\nyou want me to tell you<br />\neverything?!) In the course of<br />\nthe book, Milo manages to<br />\nthink about many of the questions that this kind of book<br />\nnormally strives to avoid. From<br />\nthe first chapter, where Milo<br />\nthinks about the legacy of the<br />\nMidwest, to the last, where he<br />\ncontemplates who has responsibility for world problems, the<br />\nthemes are developed in ways<br />\nthat make you think.<br />\nIt is this way of presenting<br />\nMilo as a character who thinks<br />\nsimply about deep questions<br />\nthat makes all the fantastic happenings believable. Though we<br />\nrarely find people who find a<br />\ncache of drugs and munitions,<br />\nwe know a lot of people like<br /><br />\nMilo. Our world may not be<br />\nfilled with the other characters<br />\nand events, but we know that if<br />\nwe were put into the same situations, we'd do the same things.<br />\nBoth bad and noble things are<br />\ndone because they must be<br />\ndone. The themes are taken up<br />\nbecause they are thrust on<br />\nMilo. That's why the book is so<br />\nbelievable.<br />\nEither one of these elements,<br />\nplot or style, is normally<br /><br />\nAuthor James Crowley<br /><br />\nenough to get us to read a<br />\nbook.

The<br />\nalbum is a decent hardcore<br />\npunk sampler featuring songs<br />\nby Black Flag, the Circle Jerks,<br />\nand Suicidal Tendencies; in<br />\nfact, the album is responsible<br />\nfor popularizing (in a strict cult<br />\nsense) Suicidal Tendencies'<br />\nclassic song, \"Institutionalized.\" Thus, I assumed that this<br />\nwould be some sort of punk<br />\nrock movie. It's not really;<br />\npunk is just one element of its<br />\nmadness. That much is<br />\nrelegated to the first fifteen<br />\nminutes or so of this movie,<br /><br />\nshowing main character Otto's<br />\nnatural punk element. In fact,<br />\nthe movie takes the somewhat<br />\nnaive and cliched view that all<br />\npunk rockers are criminal,<br />\nthough this can easily be<br />\nforgiven, since it's used to great<br />\neffect. Anyway, hardcore fans<br />\nwon't be disappointed, if solely for the hilarious cameo appearance by the Circle Jerks.<br />\nRepo man is probably the<br />\nfirst movie directly inspired by<br />\nWeekly World News. Its plot<br />\ngoes somewhat like this: Otto,<br />\nan LA punk rocker (played<br />\nquite convincingly by Emilio<br />\nEstevez, the son of Martin<br />\nSheen) gets indoctrinated into<br />\nthe world of car repossesion by<br />\nBud, a veteran repo man<br />\n(Harry Dean Stanton.) At the<br />\nsame time there's a Chevy<br /><br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix<br /><br />\nLIQUID SKY<br />\nthe<br />\nelaborate story<br />\nabout a girl<br />\nfrom Connecticut<br />\nFRIDAY &amp; SATURDAY<br />\n7 9 &amp; 11pm<br />\nSHRIVER<br /><br />\nSenior Class Film Series<br />\nAt*<br /><br />\nafoSosa ,ItyCiimht Ilesio\u2022\u202244<br /><br />\nLisps*<br />\nopt out ha'the<br />\nloasioot olovb<br />\nabout<br />\nweer=1\u2022P<br /><br />\nPOMO<br />\n1INIS Mipsripsermi<br /><br />\nAlso showing BUGS BUNNY<br /><br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nNov 16 &amp; 17<br /><br />\n7:00 9:00 &amp; 11:00<br /><br />\nMalibu with aliens in its trunk<br />\nbeing driven around LA, which<br />\na secret government agency<br />\n(though that's really not made<br />\nclear) will go to any lengths to<br />\nget. Thus, a $20,000 reward is<br />\noffered for its recovery. This of<br />\ncourse gets to the repo men,<br />\nand they spend the rest of the<br />\nmovie trying to get the Malibu.<br />\nBut plot is probably about as<br />\nimportant in this movie as it<br />\nwas in a movie like Airplane!In<br />\nfact, there hasn't been a movie<br />\nsince Airplane! in which you<br />\nhave had to pay so much attention to what's going on in the<br />\nbackground. What makes this<br />\nmovie great is its complete irreverence coupled with a lot of<br />\nsensible thinking; it quite nicely avoids the problems of<br />\npreachiness, the downfall of<br />\nmany an independent movie,<br />\nand complete weirdness. The<br />\nmovie isn't so bizarre that you<br />\ncan't figure out what's going<br />\non.<br />\nFurthermore, Repo Man is<br />\nremarkable in the way in which<br />\nthe distinctions between reality<br />\nand un-reality are blurred. I<br />\nmentioned Weekly World<br />\nNews\u2014that's the world in<br />\nwhich this movie is based: a<br />\nworld of UFO's, time<br />\nmachines, and evil punk<br />\nrockers. The movie slips effortlessly from the bizarre to<br />\nthe realistic, from the<br />\npsychedelic world of Otto's<br />\nparents' house, ruled by an omnipotent TV evangelist, to the<br />\nvery real relationships between<br /><br />\nOtto and his repo man mentors.<br />\nSometimes there are blanks in<br />\nthe guns, sometimes there are<br />\nreal bullets. Yet ultimately you<br />\nare left with the impression that<br />\nmaybe things aren't so unreal<br />\nafter all. At on point, the<br />\ndriver of the Malibu (Fox Harris) describes in vowing detail<br />\nthe effects of the neut.=<br />\nbomb. At first you laugh, but<br />\nthen you realize\u2014hey, the<br />\nneutron bomb is for real. At<br />\nanother point, there is a scene<br />\nso violent that you have to<br />\nlaugh at the overkill until you<br />\nremember that less than two<br />\nblocks away from a lot of us a<br />\nwoman was raped, savagely<br />\nbeaten, and almost set on fire.<br />\nMaybe the real world isn't as<br />\nreal as we imagine it is. And<br />\nthrough it all there is one<br />\ncharacter, the idiot/sage/hero,<br />\nMiller, played by Tracey<br />\nWalter, who seems to straddle<br />\nthis line\u2014he's the WWN<br />\nembodied.<br />\nAt one point in this movie<br />\nBud says something to the effect of \"Ordinary fucking<br />\npeople\u2014I hate 'em... the ordinary person spends his whole<br />\nlife trying to get out of tense<br />\nsituations. The repo man<br />\nspends his whole life getting into tense situations.\" There is a<br />\nclear line drawn between people like Otto's parents who are<br />\nsimultaneously stoned and<br />\nbrainwashed and the intensity<br />\nseekers. It is virtually the punk<br />\nethic: in order to keep your<br />\nsanity in this real/un-real world<br /><br />\nyou must have extreme stimulation, all the time. When Otto's<br />\nPunk criminal friends rip off a<br />\nstore, it's simply the equivalent<br />\nof taking speed\u2014\"Let's do a<br />\ncrime,\" is what they say. The<br />\nsame is true of the repo man\u2014<br />\nthey have to break into half of<br />\nthe cars they repossess, usually<br />\nin plain sight of the owner.<br />\nBut don't let the above<br />\n\"musings\" mislead you into<br />\nthinking that Repo Man is<br />\nanything less than afun movie.<br />\nIt itself is damn intense\u2014the<br />\naction never stops long enough<br />\nfor you to catch your breath.<br />\nAnd the sight gags are never<br />\nmerely \"silly\" as they often<br />\nwere in Airplane!. Furthermore, the acting is very competent, the plot is just loaded with<br />\ntwists and bizarre coincidences,<br />\nand the production values<br />\noverall are very good. An interesting note: the executive<br />\nproducer of Repo Man was<br />\nMichael Nesmith\u2014maybe there<br />\nwas something to the Monkees<br />\nafter all.<br />\nI'll close by saying that I actually feel kind of bad about<br />\nreviewing this movie now,<br />\nbecause as far as I know there<br />\nis no place anywhere near here<br />\nwhere this movie is playing. But<br />\nI'm confident that it will<br />\nbecome something of a cult<br />\nfilm (as an independently made<br />\nmovie has to become to make<br />\nany money anymore)so be sure<br />\nto catch it the next time around.<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nTHEATRE:<br /><br />\nthrough Dec. 9.

Everybody is out to prove that this is a solid club.\"<br />\nWith only one starter among the seven returnees<br />\nfrom last year's varsity squad and no freshman<br />\nrecruits, the hoopsters may have difficulty maturing<br />\nas a team.<br />\nStill, Coach Doherty feels that the team has many<br />\nstrong points. \"We have an abundance of 6'2\" and<br />\n6'3\" players and we're much quicker this year than<br />\nlast,\" he said. \"We'll be out to exploit our advantages<br />\nby being more daring on defense. We'll gamble more<br />\nbecause of our quickness, look to the fastbreak outlet<br />\npasses and also press more.\"<br />\nThe close games will be the critical ones for the Jays<br />\nthis year if they do hope to finish with a winning<br />\nrecord. Last year, the team was 3-4 in games which<br />\nwere decided by three or less points. Claims Doherty,<br />\n\"Discipline wins the close games and we'll run a more<br />\ndisciplined game plan this year. You have to win the<br />\nclose ones to make the playoffs.\"<br />\nWhile hopes are high for the upcoming season, it<br />\nwould be unfair to expect last year's reserves to quickly<br />\ndevelop into a cohesive starting unit. Doherty admits<br />\nthat the team \"does not have the best talent individually,\" but believes they will do well \"if everybody accepts their role and plays within themselves.\"<br />\nSaid the coach, \"We're an undetermined commodity, but exploitation of our speed, and our desire to win<br />\nand improve on last year will make us more successful.<br />\nWe will play as a unit and be competitive. I'm very<br />\noptimistic about our chances.\"<br /><br />\nKen Puhala<br />\nFrederick, MD<br />\nGuard<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'0\", 175<br /><br />\nTerry Ryan<br />\nMerrick, NY<br />\nForward<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'3\", 170<br /><br />\nThe captain of this year's squad, Puhala will start<br />\nat guard.

The loss<br />\ndropped the Blue Jays' record<br />\nto 7-8-2.<br />\nThe game, played at<br />\nSalisbury State, was a semifinal matchup in the Maryland<br />\nState Tournment. Hopkins<br />\nknocked off the Green Terrors<br />\nof Western Maryland to advance to this round. The<br />\nbooters were riding a fourgame winning streak, but<br />\nwere unable to push it to<br />\nfive.<br />\n.<br />\nAfter a three hour van ride to<br />\nSalisbury, the Jays were greeted<br />\nwith a goal by Seagull Paul<br />\nMousec only three minutes into the match.<br />\n\"We came out sluggish,\"<br />\nsaid junior midfielder Rob Nardino. \"We were a little<br />\nunorganized and they caught us<br />\noff guard. The early goal kind<br />\nof demoralized us, knd we<br />\nnever settled into our game.\"<br />\nSalisbury State showed up<br />\nready to play, while Hopkins<br />\nappeared tentative. Some intensity was lacking, and, as<br />\nfreshman standout Steve Gallo<br />\nput it, \"We weren't tackling<br />\nhard.\"<br />\nSalisbury kept penetrating<br />\nthrough the Jay defense, and<br />\nthe Seagulls scored again ten<br />\nmunutes before halftime on a<br />\nheader by Mike Orlowski.<br />\nSalisbury outshot Hopkins 8-3<br />\nin the first half, and they held<br />\na 2-0 lead at the intermission.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were playing<br />\nwithout the services of junior<br />\nDave Gallo, Steve's brother<br />\nand one of the team's top offensive threats. Gallo sprained<br />\nhis ankle sliding into the goalie<br />\nimmilmaw<br /><br />\nJunior Rob Nardino was one of the Jays top assistmen this season.<br /><br />\nin Hopkins' game against Gettysburg last week. According to<br />\nNardino, \"not having Dave in<br />\nthere hurt us more than we<br />\nthought it would.\"<br />\n\"Dave's been a spark-plug<br />\nfor us. Offensively, he's been<br />\nhot \u2014 beating people, passing<br />\nand scoring,\" explained captain<br />\nDavid Plaut. \"Our offense<br />\nlooks to Dave and Grenville<br />\nJones on the outside. Without<br />\nDave, the flow of the game was<br />\nvery unbalanced.\"<br />\nIn addition to Gallo's ailment, Nardino injured his<br />\nankle in a collision with the<br />\nSalisbury goalie during the first<br />\nhalf. Although he played the<br />\nrest of the game, he was not at<br />\nfull strength.<br />\nIn the second half, the Jays<br />\ncame out with a different attitude. \"We were a little more<br />\npsyched,\" said Steve Gallo.<br />\n\"We were penetrating, but then<br />\nthey got a goal in the middle of<br />\nthe half.\" The score, at 23:13<br />\nof the second stanza, put<br /><br />\nHopkins in a big hole. The Jays<br />\nfound themselves down by<br />\nthree with only twenty minutes<br />\nto play.<br />\nResponding to the apparent<br />\nreluctance of the referee to<br />\nblow his whistle, the Blue Jays<br />\nbegan playing much more<br />\nphysically in the second half.<br />\nAs a result of their increased<br />\naggressiveness, four booters<br />\nwere rewarded with yellow<br />\ncards. Ian Rothrock, Paul<br />\nMiller, Gallo and Jones all<br />\nreceived the bright yellow<br />\npenalty placards.<br />\nHopkins finally got on the<br />\nboard late in the second half as<br />\nfreshman Kevin Flynn scored<br />\non an assist from Plaut. But, as<br />\nSteve Gallo noted, \"it was too<br />\nlittle too late\" for the Jays.<br />\nWith just two minutes left in<br />\nthe game, the referee called<br />\nPlaut for a foul in the penalty<br />\narea. Seagull Eric Tewey converted on the penalty shot,<br />\nmaking the score 4-1 and icing<br />\nthe game for Salisbury.<br /><br />\nJess Bunshaft<br /><br />\nEarly damage<br />\nAfter the game, there was a<br />\nfeeling among the players that<br />\nthe team was never able to undo the damage done by<br />\nSalisbury's quick goal at the<br />\nbeginning of the contest.<br />\n\"When they scored, we were<br />\nstunned,\" Steve Gallo said. \"It<br />\nchanged the whole momentum<br />\nof the game. It took us a long<br />\ntime to get back to our style of<br />\nplay.\"<br />\nGiving up an early goal also<br />\nled to defeat for Hopkins<br />\nearlier in the season, when<br />\nSwarthmore scored on the Jays<br />\nonly 37 seconds into the game.<br />\nThe Quakers went on to top the<br />\nJays 3-0.<br />\nThe Salisbury State contest<br />\nmarked the sixth road loss for<br />\nHopkins in 1984. While the<br />\nbooters finished 5-2-2 at<br />\nHomewood Field, their road<br />\nrecord was a poor 2-6.<br />\nSalisbury State had a grass<br />\nfield, and the Blue Jays went in-<br /><br />\nto the contest having played<br />\nthree consecutive games on the<br />\nHopkins artificial turf. As<br />\nNiyogi said,\"We always have<br />\ntrouble going from grass to<br />\nturf.\"<br />\nSteve Gallo agreed. \"Turf is<br />\nflat, and you get regular<br />\nbounces. The grass field we<br />\nplayed on had clumps which<br />\ncaused irregular bounces,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nUnwilling to consider any excuses, Plaut felt that \"the main<br />\nreason we didn't play very well<br />\nwas just because we had an off<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nThe Jays were not happy<br />\nwith the loss, but they were<br />\nsatisfied about their improvement during the course of the<br />\nseason. \"You're always disappointed when you don't win, of<br />\ncourse,\" Niyogi said. \"I don't<br />\nthink we played as well as we<br />\ndid in our previous four<br />\ngames.\"<br />\nHowever, Steve Gallo noted,<br />\n\"the last game wasn't indicative<br />\nof what we were like during the<br />\nlast few weeks or of how much<br />\nwe improved.\"<br />\n\"We've been playing a much<br />\nbetter brand of soccer of late<br />\nthan we showed in this game.<br />\nAgainst Gettysburg we gutted<br />\nout a difficult situation,\" the<br />\ncaptain explained. \"We didn't<br />\nplay poorly against Salisbury<br />\nState; they were a really good<br />\nteam. We just didn't play with<br />\nthe same intensity. There were<br />\nmental lapses that we hadn't<br />\nhad in the last four games.
