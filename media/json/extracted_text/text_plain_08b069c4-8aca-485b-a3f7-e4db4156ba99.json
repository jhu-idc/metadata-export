Eighty per cent of the press of the nation<br />\nwas solidly aligned against President Roosevelt. It is<br />\nevident that the day when the American newspaper<br />\ncan swing an election is past. The ugly head of American journalism has shouted more charges and counter<br />\ncharges, and has provided more mud-slinging, than in<br />\nany election since the Cleveland-Blaine campaign of<br />\n1884. Yet Roosevelt, with the greatest newspapers<br />\nagainst him, won overwhelmingly.<br />\nThis one has been a campaign of labels\u2014and except<br />\nfor that provided by the small radical political groups,<br />\nall the labels have come from the Republican camps.<br />\nEvery word synonymous with \"un-American\" and \"socialistic\" has been applied to Mr. Roosevelt and his<br />\nadvisors. The American press has provided more editorial abuse than ever before in its history. It is unfortunate that American journalism, with all its potential<br />\ninfluence and possibilities of educating the public, should<br />\nstoop to smoke screen and vilification to serve its own<br />\nends.<br />\nProbably the greatest factor in the waning power of<br />\nthe press is the rapidly increasing use of the radio. All<br />\nof the important addresses of the presidential candidates were carried throughout the country by nationwide hook-ups. Gone is the possibility of making sectional appeals through the country. A serious nominee can no longer hope to convince a farmer gathering<br />\nin the middle West that he intends to provide an<br />\nexpensive farm program, if in New York he promises<br />\nan urban and industrialist audience that he will balance the budget.

Eighty per cent of the press of the nation<br />\nwas solidly aligned against President Roosevelt. It is<br />\nevident that the day when the American newspaper<br />\ncan swing an election is past. The ugly head of American journalism has shouted more charges and counter<br />\ncharges, and has provided more mud-slinging, than in<br />\nany election since the Cleveland-Blaine campaign of<br />\n1884.

The American press has provided more editorial abuse than ever before in its history. It is unfortunate that American journalism, with all its potential<br />\ninfluence and possibilities of educating the public, should<br />\nstoop to smoke screen and vilification to serve its own<br />\nends.<br />\nProbably the greatest factor in the waning power of<br />\nthe press is the rapidly increasing use of the radio. All<br />\nof the important addresses of the presidential candidates were carried throughout the country by nationwide hook-ups. Gone is the possibility of making sectional appeals through the country. A serious nominee can no longer hope to convince a farmer gathering<br />\nin the middle West that he intends to provide an<br />\nexpensive farm program, if in New York he promises<br />\nan urban and industrialist audience that he will balance the budget.
