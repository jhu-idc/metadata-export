Puss<br />\nWatson in the beginning bore the<br />\nbrunt of the gaining, but tired as<br />\nthe game wore on, so Calkins<br />\ncame more and more into the<br />\nlimelight. However, Puss showed<br />\nthat he had \u2022 always one more<br />\ngood punch left when he tore<br />\naround right end for a spectacular twenty-five yard run in the<br />\nfourth period, which was largely<br />\ninstrumental in the scoring of the<br />\nfinal touchdown. Little Dick<br />\nTome, until he was hurt, played a<br />\nbrilliant game, and Bobby Owings, who went in in his place,<br />\ngeneraled the team cleverly.<br />\nThe visitors scored their single<br />\ntouchdown when Behman punted<br />\nfrom his 40-yard line.

The Blue and White tightened on their 10-yard line and<br />\nHoffman was sent in to dropkick. However, the angle was too<br />\ngreat, and the ball went wide.<br />\nLebanon was unable to gain, and<br />\nwas forced to punt. Tome ran<br />\nthe ball back twenty yards, being<br />\ndowned on their 40-yard line.<br />\nHopkins tore off two more first<br />\ndowns, to,be held on the visitors<br />\n15-yard line.

Beginning Monday, November 3rd, the drive will extend over<br />\na period of four weeks, culminat- \u2022<br />\ning the Monday after the St.<br />\nJohu's game. Each week during<br />\nthis month, a circular or folder<br />\nWill be mailed to each alumnus,<br />\ntogether with a form of pledge,<br />\nurging the imperative necessity of<br />\na dormitory at Hopkins. Five<br />\nyears will be allowed for the redemptioii. of this pledge. Mr.<br />\nGeorge L. Radcliffe, Maryland's<br />\nsecretary of state, is president of<br />\nthe Alumni Association and is in<br />\nCharge of the campaign. The estimated cost of the dormitory will<br />\nbe $300,000. The proposed new<br />\nbuilding will be in the rear of the<br />\nCarroll mansion and will face<br />\n' Charles street. If the fund is<br />\nraised, ground will probably be<br />\nbroke11 this spring and the building completed before the opening<br />\nof the University next fall. The<br />\nPlans have already been drawn.<br />\nThe plan to build a memorial<br />\ndormitory came into being at the<br />\nAlumni Reunion in June, when<br />\nMr. Glassie '92 made a stirring<br />\nappeal for \"a living memorial to<br />\nWhat Hopkins men fought for and<br />\ndied for during the war.\" It was<br />\n.then that the proposed campaign<br />\nbecame a reality, for Dr. Tom<br />\nBrown, president of the class of<br />\n1902, pledged his class for $5,000.<br />\nHe was .followed by the presidents of '00 and '03 both of whom<br />\nPledged a minimum of $10,000 for<br />\ntheir classes. This movement was<br />\ntaken up by others until the evening ended with $59,000 pledged.<br />\nThe presidents of all the Alumni<br />\nClasses have written to their<br />\nclass mates in behalf of the dormitory, and prominent alumni of<br />\nBaltimore will address the Alumni Associations of the different<br />\nstates.

It is the<br />\nreal beginning of an important<br />\nera for this University. Every<br />\none who has watched the progress<br />\nof Hopkins in the last four years,<br />\nwho has seen her move from Howard street to Homewood, who has<br />\nwatched the erection of the beautiful new buildings and the improvements in the grounds, must<br />\nfeel pleasure in these outward<br />\nsigns of inward greatness. But,<br />\nif they hold the future of Hopkins<br />\ndear, they have looked forward to<br />\nthe erection of a new dormitory.<br />\nThey have seen the need for housing the students of the college, for<br />\nbringing them together on the<br />\ncampus in a unified community<br />\nfrom which can spring true col,<br />\nlege spirit.<br />\nThis is what Hopkins needs<br />\nmore than additions to her faculty, more than a scientific discovery, more than a treatise on some<br />\nlearned subject, more than a laboratory, more than new books.<br />\nShe needs a physical means to<br />\nbind her devotees together, to<br />\n\"collegify\" college.<br />\nThis first dorinitory is to be a<br />\nmemorial dormitory and its halls<br />\nare to be named after the Hopkins men who fell in the war. In<br />\nno other way could the memory<br />\nof these fallen heroes be more indelibly impressed upon the minds<br />\nof future Hopkins students.

This<br />\ntime it is the sixth goal that is<br />\nundertaken.<br />\nIt is believed that a dormitory<br />\nwill give to Hopkins what it has<br />\nalways lacked: a community<br />\nspirit. The dormitory would be a<br />\ncommon meeting place for all the<br />\nmembers of the University. It<br />\nwould be the home of the faculty, graduates and undergraduates alike. An advantage of a<br />\ndormitory over other buildings, is<br />\nthat it is self-supporting. The<br />\nhalls would be named for Hopkins men who were killed in the<br />\nwar. Former President Gilman in<br />\nhis book entitled, \"The Launching<br />\nof a University,\" said: \"Nothing,<br />\nhowever, has happened in our history of greater importance to the<br />\ncollege than the move to Homewood. Here is an opportunity for<br />\nanother experiinent, under most<br />\nfavorable conditions. The present attractive surroundings must<br />\nreact upon the student body and<br />\nlead to a happier and more satisfactory life.
