Bessemer's method of<br />\nforcing air through molten pigiron in a giant converter is much<br />\nmore simple and convenient. In<br />\ncommunities where electric power is cheap, the electric arc furnace is used, which has a capacity<br />\nof about 30 tons. The openhearth process, however, is generally accepted as better than any<br />\nother in the manufacturing of<br />\nsteel on a large scale. Pig-iron<br />\nis placed in an open furnace and<br />\nsubjected to a tremendously high<br />\ntemperature, as high as the brick<br />\nwork can stand, for eight or<br />\ntwelve hours. 250 tons of molten<br />\nsteel is the result. Most of the<br />\nsteel manufactured in the world<br />\ntoday is open hearth steel.<br />\nA number of illustrative slides<br />\nwere thrown on the screen showing pictures .of the extensive steel<br />\nworks at Sparrows Point.

As a matter offact,<br />\nthere are many important men in an organization like Westinghouse who seldom use<br />\na desk or office at all. They achieve by<br />\ngoing to other men's offices.

ROBERTS ADDRESSES<br />\nASSEMBLY ON STEEL<br />\nContinued from page 1<br /><br />\nern processes of manufacture.<br />\nThe crucible process, he said, has<br />\nproved unsatisfactory i recent<br />\nyears. Bessemer's method of<br />\nforcing air through molten pigiron in a giant converter is much<br />\nmore simple and convenient. In<br />\ncommunities where electric power is cheap, the electric arc furnace is used, which has a capacity<br />\nof about 30 tons. The openhearth process, however, is generally accepted as better than any<br />\nother in the manufacturing of<br />\nsteel on a large scale. Pig-iron<br />\nis placed in an open furnace and<br />\nsubjected to a tremendously high<br />\ntemperature, as high as the brick<br />\nwork can stand, for eight or<br />\ntwelve hours. 250 tons of molten<br />\nsteel is the result. Most of the<br />\nsteel manufactured in the world<br />\ntoday is open hearth steel.<br />\nA number of illustrative slides<br />\nwere thrown on the screen showing pictures .of the extensive steel<br />\nworks at Sparrows Point. These<br />\nincluded the rolling mills, with<br />\ntheir vast system of complicated<br />\nrollers capable of reducing huge<br />\ningots of red-hot steel to thin<br />\nstrips or plates; the huge blast<br />\nfurnace; the insatiable Bessemer<br />\nconverters with bursts of flame<br />\nroaring out of their upturned<br />\nmouths; the orderly rows of coke<br />\novens-; and many other interesting<br />\npictures of the mighty machinery<br />\nused in the iron and steel industry.<br />\nMr. Roberts concluded his talk<br />\nwith the statement that, although<br />\nthere has been a great deal of<br />\nspeculation as to the suppiy 01<br />\niron ore in the world, it has been<br />\nestimated that only seven percent of the reserve of ore has been<br />\nused in the history of iron.<br />\nAfter George Hess announced<br />\nthat notices would be posted some<br />\ntime this week advising Seniors<br />\nwhere the Hullabaloo pictures<br />\nwill be taken, Townsend rolled*<br />\nup the slide screen disclosing on<br />\nthe blackboard two magic words:<br />\n\"Beat Maryland !\" The noise<br />\nthat ensued must have convinced<br />\nanyone within the radius of a mile<br />\nthat Hopkins is in dead earnest<br />\nabout backing up the team on<br />\nThanksgiving Day. There will<br />\nbe a giant bonfire to prove it.<br /><br />\nHe\u2014Do you think that you<br />\ncould learn to love me?<br />\nShe\u2014I'm afraid not.<br />\nHe\u2014'Tis as I feared, too old to<br />\nlearn.\u2014Jack o' Lantern.<br /><br />\nAcross Another Man's Desk<br />\nThose looking forward to careers in<br />\nbusiness often associate the big accomplishments with men in private offices, who sit<br />\nback of massive desks. As a matter offact,<br />\nthere are many important men in an organization like Westinghouse who seldom use<br />\na desk or office at all. They achieve by<br />\ngoing to other men's offices. They are termed<br />\n\"sales engineers\".<br /><br />\nbe witnessed in every branch of industrial<br />\nlife today.<br /><br />\nGeorge Westinghouse,for example,rendered his greatest service to industry and<br />\nmankind not merely by perfecting alternating current but by selling it\u2014in the face<br />\nof the stiffest kind of opposition.<br /><br />\nFollowing the example of its Founder,<br />\nthe Westinghouse organization includes a<br />\nbody of engineers whose work is to carry<br />\nelectrical advancement into every nook and<br />\ncorner of the world. They have sold electrification to the factories, the farms, the<br />\nhomes, the railroads, the mines, the ships.<br />\nThey are mechanical and electrical, engineers whose imaginations are fired, not<br />\nmerely by engineering achievement, but<br />\nby the benefits from such achievement to<br />\n\"the market\".<br /><br />\nAuthorities declared it was impractical; laws were urged against it; yet the<br />\nsalesman, Westinghouse, threw back of<br />\nalternating current, the strength of his<br />\nselling personality\u2014with results that can<br /><br />\nEngineering needs men of sales ability<br />\nand sales personality; and industry needs<br />\nto have them in engineering. Organizations like Westinghouse, must sell before<br />\nthey can serve.<br /><br />\nWestinghouse<br />\nACHIEVEMENT8 OPPORTUNITY<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37915, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "0e5b52dd-c1aa-48ad-875e-969168c2f668", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13146-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13146, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "a8931f94-ac8a-4d9b-87d9-76f9b98f06ce", "url": "/node/13146"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "95fb2ae4-82ab-4ef5-900a-1d34ac78b06a"}]}
