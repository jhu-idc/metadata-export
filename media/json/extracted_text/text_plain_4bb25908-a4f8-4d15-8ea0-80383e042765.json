M. C. A.<br />\nIt is planned to have these<br />\nmeetings become a fixed institution, which will serve as a means<br />\nto keep interest in the various<br />\nHopkins activities alive among<br />\nthe students. A feature of future<br />\nassemblies will be the incorporation of the series of vocational<br />\ntalks, begun last week by the Y.<br />\nM. C. A. with the address by Dr.<br />\nBirckhead. According to the present proposal, these talks will be<br />\ngiven under the joint auspices of<br />\nall the associations mentioned.<br />\nAnother feature of the meetings, if the plan materializes, will<br />\nbe discussion of various matters<br />\nby the students themselves. After<br />\nthe address has been delivered by<br />\nthe speaker of the day, and after<br />\nany announcements which either<br />\nthe faculty or any student organization wishes to bring forth have<br />\nbeen read, the meeting will be<br />\nturned into an open forum, where<br />\ninformal remarks on problems of<br />\nstudent interest may be made<br />\nfrom the floor.<br />\nBoth President Goodnow and<br />\nDean Brush have expressed themselves in hearty accord with the<br />\ngeneral idea of such meetings.<br />\nFormal consent for the series<br />\nplanned has not as yet been obtained, but there is every likelihood that the plan will soon be<br />\nofficially indorsed.<br />\nThe meeting last Thursday had<br />\nbeen requested by the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa and was to have<br />\nbeen presided over by the dean.<br />\nDr. Brush's illness, however, rendered this impossible.<br />\nAt the present time, it seems<br />\nunlikely that the meetings can be<br />\nheld at any time which conflicts<br />\nwith the regular class hours. It<br />\nis felt, however, that the sacrifice<br />\nof half an hour will be made willingly by the great majority of the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nThe details of the plan have<br />\nnot as yet been fully worked out<br />\nby the various organizations, but,<br />\nonce that it has been cifficially indorsed, no difficulty is anticipated<br />\nin completing all the necessary arrangements. Especial care is to<br />\nbe taken to see that the length of<br />\nthe meetings is restricted to a<br />\nreasonable time.<br />\n<br />\nAt the Park School last Monday<br />\nmorning the committee which has<br />\nin charge the advertisement of<br />\nHopkins in the preparatory,and<br />\nhigh schools began its active work.<br />\nThose who are writing the<br />\nspeeches, which are to be placed<br />\nin the hands of different delegations of undergraduates to be delivered in as many of the Maryland schools as possible before<br />\nnext June, had an opportunity on<br />\nthis occasion to try out their material before a most attentive and<br />\nappreciative audience. The advantages of the academic department of our University were presented by Reuben Oppenheimer.<br />\nRandolph Smith, in a clear and<br />\nconcrete manner, told the story of<br />\nthe Hopkins Technical School and<br />\nexplained the advantages and<br />\npromising position which this department occupies among institutions of its kind. The last speech<br />\nwas made by Frederick P. Hall,<br />\nchairman of the committee, who<br />\ndescribed the Homewood buildings and the various forms of<br />\nstudent activities which are engaged in by the Hopkins students.<br />\nThis last talk was illustrated by<br />\nlantern slides showing buildings,<br />\nviews of the campus, and representative athletic teams.<br />\nFrom the manner in which the<br />\nsubjects were presented and from<br />\nthe cordial reception which the efforts of the delegation received at<br />\nthe hands of the students and officers of the school it is to be inferred that this newly inaugurated branch of service to our<br />\nAlma Mater is to have results of<br />\nsignificant proportions.<br />\nIn all the advances which the<br />\ncommittee has made to various<br />\nschool authorities its offers have<br />\nbeen accepted with the utmost<br />\neagerness and commendation. The<br />\nonly obstacle which now blocks<br />\nthe pathway to the fullest measure of success is the preoccupation of those who are asked to<br />\ntake part in the work. The approach of examinations, the<br />\nsteady increase in the activity of<br />\nthe athletic organizations, and a<br />\ngeneral attitude of conservatism<br />\non the part of many otherwise<br />\ncapable workers, all are counteracting tendencies to the success<br />\nof the work.<br />\nOn Wednesday the second attack in the campaign is to be<br />\nstaged at Jefferson School. The<br />\ndelegation will consist of Robert<br />\nG. Merrick,Henry Baker and John<br />\nC. Knipp, while another public-<br />\n<br />\nThe Commemoration Day exercises of the forty-first anniversary<br />\nof the founding of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity will be held on the<br />\nmorning of February 22. The address of the day will be delivered<br />\nby ex-President William Howard<br />\nTaft, now Kent professor of law<br />\nat Yale University.<br />\nThe assembly room in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building at Homewood is not large enough to accommodate the crowd expected to<br />\nbe present at these ceremonies,<br />\nhence the Lyric Opera House has<br />\nbeen secured. The exercises will<br />\nbe held there at 11 o'clock on the<br />\nmorning of February 22.<br />\nHopkins has always been singularly fortunate in obtaining wellknown and talented men to speak<br />\nat the Commemoration Day exercises. Last year, Dr. Wellington<br />\nKoo, the Chinese Minister at<br />\nWashington,delivered the address,<br />\nand the year before, Dr. Nicholas<br />\nMurray Butler, president of Columbia University, was the chief<br />\norator.<br />\nMr. Taft has not as yet announced the subject of his speech,<br />\nnor have all the arrangements for<br />\nthe exercises been completed. The<br />\nrequest to take part in the exercises was dispatched to Mr. Taft<br />\nsome time ago, but, until a few<br />\ndays ago, he did not feel at liberty to announce definitely that<br />\nhe would be able to accept.<br />\n<br />\nThe annual field and track meet<br />\nheld by the sophomore and freshman classes last Saturday in the<br />\nold Howard street gymnasium resulted in a well-won victory for<br />\nthe freshmen, the final score being 46 to 31.<br />\nBeverly Smith, captain of the<br />\n1920 Class team, was the star of<br />\nthe contest, winning first in both<br />\nthe 220-yard and 440-yard dashes,<br />\nand second in the 30-yard dash.<br />\nHis time in the quarter was<br />\n582/5 seconds, which is a remarkably good cage record. The second highest point winner was<br />\nBowen, a graduate of Polytechnic,<br />\nalso a member of the freshman<br />\nclass. Bowen won first in the<br />\nmile and 880-yard run.<br />\nMelamet was the individual<br />\nstar of the sophomores in the<br />\ndashes, achieving second places in<br />\nthe high jump, the 220 and 440yard dashes. In the last two<br />\nevents he gave Smith a close rub,<br />\nbeing in the lead for a couple of<br />\nlaps in the 440, but Smith passed<br />\nhim in the final spurt.<br />\nThe freshmen started off with a<br />\nflourish that gave them both<br />\nplaces in the 30-yard dash, Bratt<br />\nbeing first and Smith second.<br />\nMelamet and Weech ran best for<br />\nthe sophomores.<br />\nThe 880 was one of the best<br />\nraces of the day, being in doubt<br />\nuntil the crack of the pistol on<br />\nthe last lap, when Bowen, displaying remarkable reserve force,<br />\ndashed to victory a few yards<br />\nahead of his sophomore opponent.<br />\nThe agility of Melamet seemed<br />\nat first to presage success for him<br />\nover Parkman ('20) in the high<br />\njump. The bar rose higher and<br />\nhigher but at 5 feet 4 inches the<br />\nsophomore failed to clear, and<br />\nParkman was granted a hard-won<br />\nvictory. Parkman again showed<br />\nhis prowess in the 30-yard hurdles<br />\nin which he tied with Defandorf<br />\n('20).<br />\nThe final event--the sophomorefreshman relay race\u2014was won by<br />\n1920. The summary:<br />\n<br />\n\"Barn\" to Have Opening After Exams.<br />\n<br />\nIn spite of the completion and<br />\npresent use of the Student Activities Building, it was definitely decided by the University authorities to postpone the official opening and dedication until after the<br />\nmid-year examinations. It is the<br />\nhope of the committee in charge<br />\nto make this reception a fine affair, and it was thought unwise<br />\nto attempt ally action which<br />\nmight interfere with or be interfered with by the examinations.<br />\nAccording to present plans, it is<br />\ndesired to get the alumni out in<br />\nforce. Speeches will be made by<br />\nboth past and present students.<br />\nspirited senior has consented to<br />\nfacilitate matters by means of his<br />\nmotorcar. Immediately after the<br />\nexaminations as full a schedule of<br />\nengagements will be arranged as<br />\nthe support of the students warrants, and the committee expects<br />\nits effectiveness to increase steadily with the accumulation of experiences and helpful suggestions.<br />\n<br />\n30-Yard Dash (First Heat)\u2014First,<br />\nSmith (freshman); second, Melamet,<br />\n(sophomore).

The fact that the<br />\nhonor system prevails at Hopkins<br />\nis regarded by upper-classmen as<br />\nan obvious commonplace\u2014as obvious as is the inevitability of examinations themselves, and it is<br />\naccepted by freshmen as a part of<br />\nthe general order into which they<br />\nhave been introduced; yet in<br />\nmany colleges and universities the<br />\nhonor system is as yet unknown,<br />\nand it has been carried to the<br />\npoint at which it exists in Hopkins only by a comparative few.<br />\nThe idea that college men are,<br />\nby nature, possessed of enough<br />\nintegrity to fulfill the little printed statement pasted across the inside of the first page of Hopkins'<br />\nexamination books, considered as<br />\nan abstract theory, is by no means<br />\na radical one. Nevertheless, the<br />\nfact remains that, at many American colleges, classes are treated<br />\non the theory that the only thing<br />\nwhich prevents them from reading<br />\noff notes from their cuffs or from<br />\nhaving a general consultation as<br />\nto the way in which a certain<br />\nquestion should be answered is<br />\nthe presence of a vigilant professor at their elbow. The exact<br />\ncausal relation between espionage<br />\n<br />\nand attempted transgression has<br />\nnever been exactly determined,<br />\nbut the conviction is coming to be<br />\nstronger and stronger that the<br />\nbest way to insure a man's honesty is to assume that honesty before you begin.<br />\nIt should be thoroughly understood by freshmen that they are<br />\nunder no obligation to sign the<br />\npledge affixed to their examination papers. Nor if, for any reason, they do not wish to sign it,<br />\nwill it be assumed for an instant<br />\nthat their refusal is necessarily<br />\ndue to an inability to meet with<br />\nits requirements. It is the policy<br />\nof the Student Council to urge all<br />\nto sign the slip, more as a matter<br />\nof form than anything else, as an<br />\nappreciation of the courtesy on<br />\nthe part of the faculty which the<br />\nhonor system involves; but even<br />\nif it is not so formally attested,<br />\nthe fact that \"assistance has<br />\nneither been given nor received\"<br />\nis always regarded as a matter<br />\nof course.<br />\nHopkins has quite a few problems to solve during the next few<br />\nyears, but how to obtain the honorableness of its student body is<br />\nnot one of them.<br />\nThe Eternal Question.<br />\n<br />\nJust why so many men who, in<br />\nother respects, could be regarded<br />\nas typical Hopkins products<br />\nshould insist upon designating the<br />\nUniversity which they attend by<br />\nthe name of \"school\" is a question<br />\nwhich has not as yet been satisfactorily answered. That they do<br />\nso, and that the habit is not confined to the freshmen, may be affirmed by listening to the most<br />\ncasual conversation in the basement or in the hall. \"I was almost late for school today\";<br />\n\"School is getting harder\"; \"I<br />\nwish the school would abolish examinations\" \u2014 the examples are<br />\nmyriad.<br />\nIs there no way in which the<br />\nentire student body can be made<br />\nto realize the fact that they have<br />\nleft their preparatory days behind<br />\nthem? The Baltimore City College is a school, the Polytechnic<br />\nInstitute is a school, Gilman's,<br />\nand Jefferson's, and all the rest<br />\nare schools, but Hopkins is a university. If the thing were only<br />\nan evidence of slang, it would be<br />\nunderstandable and excusable, but<br />\nit isn't\u2014it is the evidence of an<br />\nunmistakable provincialism, the<br />\nremnant of an atmosphere which<br />\nshould have been discarded\u2014and<br />\nhasn't been.<br />\n<br />\nsuccess in athletics than has ever<br />\nbeen attained heretofore.

M. C. A.<br />\nIt is planned to have these<br />\nmeetings become a fixed institution, which will serve as a means<br />\nto keep interest in the various<br />\nHopkins activities alive among<br />\nthe students. A feature of future<br />\nassemblies will be the incorporation of the series of vocational<br />\ntalks, begun last week by the Y.<br />\nM. C. A. with the address by Dr.<br />\nBirckhead. According to the present proposal, these talks will be<br />\ngiven under the joint auspices of<br />\nall the associations mentioned.<br />\nAnother feature of the meetings, if the plan materializes, will<br />\nbe discussion of various matters<br />\nby the students themselves. After<br />\nthe address has been delivered by<br />\nthe speaker of the day, and after<br />\nany announcements which either<br />\nthe faculty or any student organization wishes to bring forth have<br />\nbeen read, the meeting will be<br />\nturned into an open forum, where<br />\ninformal remarks on problems of<br />\nstudent interest may be made<br />\nfrom the floor.<br />\nBoth President Goodnow and<br />\nDean Brush have expressed themselves in hearty accord with the<br />\ngeneral idea of such meetings.<br />\nFormal consent for the series<br />\nplanned has not as yet been obtained, but there is every likelihood that the plan will soon be<br />\nofficially indorsed.<br />\nThe meeting last Thursday had<br />\nbeen requested by the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa and was to have<br />\nbeen presided over by the dean.<br />\nDr. Brush's illness, however, rendered this impossible.<br />\nAt the present time, it seems<br />\nunlikely that the meetings can be<br />\nheld at any time which conflicts<br />\nwith the regular class hours. It<br />\nis felt, however, that the sacrifice<br />\nof half an hour will be made willingly by the great majority of the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nThe details of the plan have<br />\nnot as yet been fully worked out<br />\nby the various organizations, but,<br />\nonce that it has been cifficially indorsed, no difficulty is anticipated<br />\nin completing all the necessary arrangements. Especial care is to<br />\nbe taken to see that the length of<br />\nthe meetings is restricted to a<br />\nreasonable time.<br /><br />\nAt the Park School last Monday<br />\nmorning the committee which has<br />\nin charge the advertisement of<br />\nHopkins in the preparatory,and<br />\nhigh schools began its active work.<br />\nThose who are writing the<br />\nspeeches, which are to be placed<br />\nin the hands of different delegations of undergraduates to be delivered in as many of the Maryland schools as possible before<br />\nnext June, had an opportunity on<br />\nthis occasion to try out their material before a most attentive and<br />\nappreciative audience. The advantages of the academic department of our University were presented by Reuben Oppenheimer.<br />\nRandolph Smith, in a clear and<br />\nconcrete manner, told the story of<br />\nthe Hopkins Technical School and<br />\nexplained the advantages and<br />\npromising position which this department occupies among institutions of its kind. The last speech<br />\nwas made by Frederick P. Hall,<br />\nchairman of the committee, who<br />\ndescribed the Homewood buildings and the various forms of<br />\nstudent activities which are engaged in by the Hopkins students.<br />\nThis last talk was illustrated by<br />\nlantern slides showing buildings,<br />\nviews of the campus, and representative athletic teams.<br />\nFrom the manner in which the<br />\nsubjects were presented and from<br />\nthe cordial reception which the efforts of the delegation received at<br />\nthe hands of the students and officers of the school it is to be inferred that this newly inaugurated branch of service to our<br />\nAlma Mater is to have results of<br />\nsignificant proportions.<br />\nIn all the advances which the<br />\ncommittee has made to various<br />\nschool authorities its offers have<br />\nbeen accepted with the utmost<br />\neagerness and commendation. The<br />\nonly obstacle which now blocks<br />\nthe pathway to the fullest measure of success is the preoccupation of those who are asked to<br />\ntake part in the work. The approach of examinations, the<br />\nsteady increase in the activity of<br />\nthe athletic organizations, and a<br />\ngeneral attitude of conservatism<br />\non the part of many otherwise<br />\ncapable workers, all are counteracting tendencies to the success<br />\nof the work.<br />\nOn Wednesday the second attack in the campaign is to be<br />\nstaged at Jefferson School. The<br />\ndelegation will consist of Robert<br />\nG. Merrick,Henry Baker and John<br />\nC.

The address of the day will be delivered<br />\nby ex-President William Howard<br />\nTaft, now Kent professor of law<br />\nat Yale University.<br />\nThe assembly room in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building at Homewood is not large enough to accommodate the crowd expected to<br />\nbe present at these ceremonies,<br />\nhence the Lyric Opera House has<br />\nbeen secured. The exercises will<br />\nbe held there at 11 o'clock on the<br />\nmorning of February 22.<br />\nHopkins has always been singularly fortunate in obtaining wellknown and talented men to speak<br />\nat the Commemoration Day exercises. Last year, Dr. Wellington<br />\nKoo, the Chinese Minister at<br />\nWashington,delivered the address,<br />\nand the year before, Dr. Nicholas<br />\nMurray Butler, president of Columbia University, was the chief<br />\norator.<br />\nMr. Taft has not as yet announced the subject of his speech,<br />\nnor have all the arrangements for<br />\nthe exercises been completed. The<br />\nrequest to take part in the exercises was dispatched to Mr. Taft<br />\nsome time ago, but, until a few<br />\ndays ago, he did not feel at liberty to announce definitely that<br />\nhe would be able to accept.<br /><br />\nThe annual field and track meet<br />\nheld by the sophomore and freshman classes last Saturday in the<br />\nold Howard street gymnasium resulted in a well-won victory for<br />\nthe freshmen, the final score being 46 to 31.<br />\nBeverly Smith, captain of the<br />\n1920 Class team, was the star of<br />\nthe contest, winning first in both<br />\nthe 220-yard and 440-yard dashes,<br />\nand second in the 30-yard dash.<br />\nHis time in the quarter was<br />\n582/5 seconds, which is a remarkably good cage record. The second highest point winner was<br />\nBowen, a graduate of Polytechnic,<br />\nalso a member of the freshman<br />\nclass. Bowen won first in the<br />\nmile and 880-yard run.<br />\nMelamet was the individual<br />\nstar of the sophomores in the<br />\ndashes, achieving second places in<br />\nthe high jump, the 220 and 440yard dashes. In the last two<br />\nevents he gave Smith a close rub,<br />\nbeing in the lead for a couple of<br />\nlaps in the 440, but Smith passed<br />\nhim in the final spurt.<br />\nThe freshmen started off with a<br />\nflourish that gave them both<br />\nplaces in the 30-yard dash, Bratt<br />\nbeing first and Smith second.<br />\nMelamet and Weech ran best for<br />\nthe sophomores.<br />\nThe 880 was one of the best<br />\nraces of the day, being in doubt<br />\nuntil the crack of the pistol on<br />\nthe last lap, when Bowen, displaying remarkable reserve force,<br />\ndashed to victory a few yards<br />\nahead of his sophomore opponent.<br />\nThe agility of Melamet seemed<br />\nat first to presage success for him<br />\nover Parkman ('20) in the high<br />\njump. The bar rose higher and<br />\nhigher but at 5 feet 4 inches the<br />\nsophomore failed to clear, and<br />\nParkman was granted a hard-won<br />\nvictory. Parkman again showed<br />\nhis prowess in the 30-yard hurdles<br />\nin which he tied with Defandorf<br />\n('20).<br />\nThe final event--the sophomorefreshman relay race\u2014was won by<br />\n1920.

The fact that the<br />\nhonor system prevails at Hopkins<br />\nis regarded by upper-classmen as<br />\nan obvious commonplace\u2014as obvious as is the inevitability of examinations themselves, and it is<br />\naccepted by freshmen as a part of<br />\nthe general order into which they<br />\nhave been introduced; yet in<br />\nmany colleges and universities the<br />\nhonor system is as yet unknown,<br />\nand it has been carried to the<br />\npoint at which it exists in Hopkins only by a comparative few.<br />\nThe idea that college men are,<br />\nby nature, possessed of enough<br />\nintegrity to fulfill the little printed statement pasted across the inside of the first page of Hopkins'<br />\nexamination books, considered as<br />\nan abstract theory, is by no means<br />\na radical one. Nevertheless, the<br />\nfact remains that, at many American colleges, classes are treated<br />\non the theory that the only thing<br />\nwhich prevents them from reading<br />\noff notes from their cuffs or from<br />\nhaving a general consultation as<br />\nto the way in which a certain<br />\nquestion should be answered is<br />\nthe presence of a vigilant professor at their elbow. The exact<br />\ncausal relation between espionage<br /><br />\nand attempted transgression has<br />\nnever been exactly determined,<br />\nbut the conviction is coming to be<br />\nstronger and stronger that the<br />\nbest way to insure a man's honesty is to assume that honesty before you begin.<br />\nIt should be thoroughly understood by freshmen that they are<br />\nunder no obligation to sign the<br />\npledge affixed to their examination papers. Nor if, for any reason, they do not wish to sign it,<br />\nwill it be assumed for an instant<br />\nthat their refusal is necessarily<br />\ndue to an inability to meet with<br />\nits requirements. It is the policy<br />\nof the Student Council to urge all<br />\nto sign the slip, more as a matter<br />\nof form than anything else, as an<br />\nappreciation of the courtesy on<br />\nthe part of the faculty which the<br />\nhonor system involves; but even<br />\nif it is not so formally attested,<br />\nthe fact that \"assistance has<br />\nneither been given nor received\"<br />\nis always regarded as a matter<br />\nof course.<br />\nHopkins has quite a few problems to solve during the next few<br />\nyears, but how to obtain the honorableness of its student body is<br />\nnot one of them.<br />\nThe Eternal Question.<br /><br />\nJust why so many men who, in<br />\nother respects, could be regarded<br />\nas typical Hopkins products<br />\nshould insist upon designating the<br />\nUniversity which they attend by<br />\nthe name of \"school\" is a question<br />\nwhich has not as yet been satisfactorily answered. That they do<br />\nso, and that the habit is not confined to the freshmen, may be affirmed by listening to the most<br />\ncasual conversation in the basement or in the hall. \"I was almost late for school today\";<br />\n\"School is getting harder\"; \"I<br />\nwish the school would abolish examinations\" \u2014 the examples are<br />\nmyriad.<br />\nIs there no way in which the<br />\nentire student body can be made<br />\nto realize the fact that they have<br />\nleft their preparatory days behind<br />\nthem? The Baltimore City College is a school, the Polytechnic<br />\nInstitute is a school, Gilman's,<br />\nand Jefferson's, and all the rest<br />\nare schools, but Hopkins is a university.
