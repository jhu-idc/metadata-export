This learned<br />\ngentleman also informs us that summer school students only eat onehalf as much candy a, the winter<br />\nstudents.<br />\n<br />\nFOR A<br />\n<br />\nYELLOW CAB<br />\n<br />\nREPRESSION IN THE COLLEGE<br />\nHE college is regarded as the cradle of original 'thought; one of<br />\nits chief aims is to provide stimulation to those unique indiPerfect<br />\nviduals who have the ability to work, along original lines.<br />\nwhatfreedom must be allowed the student to think,.read, and spak<br />\nout<br />\never, in his own opinion, is the truth. Johns Hopkins carries<br />\nhave<br />\nthis creed to perfection, but recently a number of other Colleges<br />\nunderamong<br />\nmovements<br />\nclamped down on all the so-called radical<br />\ngraduates and faculty.<br />\nThe New Student furnishes a number of instances of this policy<br />\nthe<br />\nof repression. The University of Pittsburgh recently caused<br />\nLiberal Club of that college to disband. The important aspect of<br />\nunmitigated<br />\nare<br />\nmemllers<br />\nthis case is. not whether the Liberal Club<br />\nasses or budding geniuses, but whether the Univ;rsity has the right<br />\nto keep them from acting like unmitigated asses if they so desire. In<br />\nthe reply to the Dean of men, the Liberal Club, in refusing to disband, made the following statement,\"We consider a university campus as the fittest of all places for a free discussion Of any ideas,<br />\ntheories, or practices that are current anywhere in the world.\u201d That<br />\nis a clear statement of fact. If the University of Pittsburgh desires<br />\nonly to instil a certain amount of rote learning into its student, it<br />\nwould be better if it passed from the group of universities.<br />\nwe are not upholding the ideas of the Liberal Club, but we do maintain that the members shbiild be allowed to hold and disseminate their<br />\nideas.<br />\nNot only are some college authorities busying themselves in the<br />\nfight to suppress new thought and new customs, but outside organizations are entering the fray. The Woman's'Christian 'Temperance Union, for example. The branch of the W. C..T. U. located at<br />\nFairmount, West Virginia, is vigorously campaigning against the<br />\nestablishment of smoking rooms for girls at West Virginia University.<br />\nRepression by properly constituted authority is 'frid enough, but to<br />\nallow an organization extraneous to the campus dictate the practices<br />\nof the undergraduates is infinitely worse. ,And yet the W. C. T. O.<br />\nis making no unsuccessful fight.<br />\nThis situation at West Virginia University illustrates very clearly<br />\none of the great weaknesses of state educational institutions. The<br />\nDean of a private college could very easily inform the W. C. T. U.<br />\nto mind their own business,and he would probably do that very thing.<br />\nBut the heads of state universities are dependent on politicians for<br />\ntheir positions and the politicians in turn are dependent in part on<br />\nevery fanatical group, such as the W. C. T.,U., which desires to<br />\nmix in college matters. The result is that the college authorities must<br />\npussyfoot, must be conciliatory, and must spend their time listening<br />\nto foolish advice, unless they be extraordinarily capable and fearless<br />\nmen.<br />\nNo laymen would try to tell a sculptor how to carve a bust, 'or<br />\nteach a pharmacist how to fill a prescription, but a great number of<br />\nthem, particularly women, think they know all about education and<br />\nthey all are perfectly sure they know what, why, and how the younger<br />\ngeneration should think.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nTHE ART MUSEUM<br />\nE wonder how many of the undergraduates at Johns Hopto walk half a block to investigate the<br />\nW kin, have botherednext<br />\ndoor, so to speak, the City of Baltinew Art Mu,eum Right<br />\nmore has erected a structure to exhibit the best in the fine arts which<br />\nIt is possible to obtain.

Smiley.<br />\nhead of the Department of Hygiene<br />\nand Preventative 'Aledicine at Cornell University, the health of college students trends downward from<br />\nthe time they enter, colleges as<br />\nfreshmen until they leave. Dr.<br />\nSmiley explains this by saying that<br />\neach year that a man is in college<br />\nhe takes less and less care of himself. The doctor his arrived at<br />\nthree causes for this. The first is<br />\nthat the influence of hnme and<br />\nmother is usually strong for good<br />\nhealth habits and maiitenance. The<br />\nlonger the student, is away from that<br />\ninfluence, the less he feels its effect.<br />\nSecondly, that student life has for<br />\nmany years been notable for it neglect of the ordinary hygienic laws.<br />\nThere are too 'many bull-sessions<br />\nlasting far into the night and morning and too many bouts'of excessive<br />\ndrinking. Thirdly, says Dr. Smiley,<br />\na fair number of college students<br />\nare attempting the physical impossibility of doing the work of two men,<br />\nliving the life of a day laborer to<br />\nearn a living, and the life of a student to acquire an education.<br />\nWe notice the fact that, sad as it<br />\nmay seem, although Dr. Smiley has<br />\ntold us our defects he has not suggested any means by which we may<br />\nbetter these conditions. ,<br /><br />\n\u00b0Good Smoke!<br />\nSays Hubby<br />\n\"0.

This learned<br />\ngentleman also informs us that summer school students only eat onehalf as much candy a, the winter<br />\nstudents.<br /><br />\nFOR A<br /><br />\nYELLOW CAB<br /><br />\nREPRESSION IN THE COLLEGE<br />\nHE college is regarded as the cradle of original 'thought; one of<br />\nits chief aims is to provide stimulation to those unique indiPerfect<br />\nviduals who have the ability to work, along original lines.<br />\nwhatfreedom must be allowed the student to think,.read, and spak<br />\nout<br />\never, in his own opinion, is the truth. Johns Hopkins carries<br />\nhave<br />\nthis creed to perfection, but recently a number of other Colleges<br />\nunderamong<br />\nmovements<br />\nclamped down on all the so-called radical<br />\ngraduates and faculty.<br />\nThe New Student furnishes a number of instances of this policy<br />\nthe<br />\nof repression. The University of Pittsburgh recently caused<br />\nLiberal Club of that college to disband. The important aspect of<br />\nunmitigated<br />\nare<br />\nmemllers<br />\nthis case is. not whether the Liberal Club<br />\nasses or budding geniuses, but whether the Univ;rsity has the right<br />\nto keep them from acting like unmitigated asses if they so desire. In<br />\nthe reply to the Dean of men, the Liberal Club, in refusing to disband, made the following statement,\"We consider a university campus as the fittest of all places for a free discussion Of any ideas,<br />\ntheories, or practices that are current anywhere in the world.\u201d That<br />\nis a clear statement of fact. If the University of Pittsburgh desires<br />\nonly to instil a certain amount of rote learning into its student, it<br />\nwould be better if it passed from the group of universities.<br />\nwe are not upholding the ideas of the Liberal Club, but we do maintain that the members shbiild be allowed to hold and disseminate their<br />\nideas.<br />\nNot only are some college authorities busying themselves in the<br />\nfight to suppress new thought and new customs, but outside organizations are entering the fray. The Woman's'Christian 'Temperance Union, for example. The branch of the W. C..T. U. located at<br />\nFairmount, West Virginia, is vigorously campaigning against the<br />\nestablishment of smoking rooms for girls at West Virginia University.<br />\nRepression by properly constituted authority is 'frid enough, but to<br />\nallow an organization extraneous to the campus dictate the practices<br />\nof the undergraduates is infinitely worse. ,And yet the W. C. T. O.<br />\nis making no unsuccessful fight.<br />\nThis situation at West Virginia University illustrates very clearly<br />\none of the great weaknesses of state educational institutions. The<br />\nDean of a private college could very easily inform the W. C. T. U.<br />\nto mind their own business,and he would probably do that very thing.<br />\nBut the heads of state universities are dependent on politicians for<br />\ntheir positions and the politicians in turn are dependent in part on<br />\nevery fanatical group, such as the W. C. T.,U., which desires to<br />\nmix in college matters. The result is that the college authorities must<br />\npussyfoot, must be conciliatory, and must spend their time listening<br />\nto foolish advice, unless they be extraordinarily capable and fearless<br />\nmen.<br />\nNo laymen would try to tell a sculptor how to carve a bust, 'or<br />\nteach a pharmacist how to fill a prescription, but a great number of<br />\nthem, particularly women, think they know all about education and<br />\nthey all are perfectly sure they know what, why, and how the younger<br />\ngeneration should think.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nTHE ART MUSEUM<br />\nE wonder how many of the undergraduates at Johns Hopto walk half a block to investigate the<br />\nW kin, have botherednext<br />\ndoor, so to speak, the City of Baltinew Art Mu,eum Right<br />\nmore has erected a structure to exhibit the best in the fine arts which<br />\nIt is possible to obtain.
