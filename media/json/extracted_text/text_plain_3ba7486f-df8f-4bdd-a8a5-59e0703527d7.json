The majority of them indulge themselves in that very current delusion that Hopkins is purely a medical<br />\nschool. Here is an extract from a Canadian paper.<br />\n\"Johns Hopkins University is to be complimented for one<br />\nthing at least. It does not allow its representative paper to talk<br />\nshop. We are accustomed to consider that University as affording<br />\nthe best medical facilities on the continent; yet in the January publication there is no mention of a medical topic; neither is there even a<br />\njoke which suggests the dissecting room. From the contents of the<br />\njournal the casual reader might conclude that the institution afforded better facilities for a<br />\npost-graduate course in athletics than in medicine. All the prose articles save one are on<br />\nathletics, and the solitary exception is a selection on monuments. We hope that it is not<br />\ndeemed a fitting conclusion to the preceding discourses on athletic topics.\"<br />\nIn another issue of the same paper they quote those enthusiastic verses which so ably<br />\npadded out the NEWS-LETTUR in time of need.<br />\n\"They do more than study medicine at Johns Hopkins University. Listen to this:<br />\nRosy-red lips, and honey-dew eyes,<br />\nTwo arching eyebrows, mockingly wise,<br />\nChin with a dimple, laughing and gay!<br />\nPearl among pearls!<br />\nQuestion\u2014Is it a co-educational institution or not?\"<br />\nBut the amazing part of the whole business is that the women had not at that time<br />\nbeen admitted to Hopkins. Now the query is whether or no the opinion of women will<br />\nchange when they do conic next fall. Will we still cling to the verses of S. C. C. or will we<br />\nembrace the \"vampirical\" style of Rudyard Kipling\u2014\"the rag and bone and hank of hair\u2014<br />\nbut the fool he called her his lady fair?\" This is not a question to be discussed in Gordons<br />\n'Undergraduate Club,\" nor yet in its annex the Barber Shop\u2014in short to be discussed by the<br />\nordinary mortal, but rather to the non-cigarette smoking elements\u2014the debating team and<br />\nthose enthusiastic women seekers who lounge in Levering Hall to watch the girls go home<br />\nfrom school and Kernan's.

But it is at least open to dispute whether the boys on the<br />\nthe team do not get as much inspiration from the fair ladies in the grandstand as from the<br />\nconcerted numbers rendered on the bleachers.<br />\nThere is a class of students, fortunately small, who have neither the inclination to bring<br />\na girl, (or perhaps it is that no girl has the inclination to be brought) nor the energy to get<br />\nout and root.

W. Perce, Jr.<br />\nManager, F. B. Pedrick.<br />\nLeader of the Glee Club, C. F. Ranft.<br />\nLeader of Mandolin Club, H. K. Hughes.<br />\nOn the motion of Mr. Bloomfield, the<br />\nelection of an assistant manager was posponed<br />\nuntil the fall. It was proposed that the<br />\ncandidates be made to show their merit before<br />\nanyone be chosen for the much esteemed<br />\nposition.<br />\n<br />\nby no means shows how close the contest was,<br />\nfor it was only by narrow margins that Hopkins<br />\nwon. The hundred and two hundred and<br />\ntwenty yard dashes were won by the narrowest<br />\nmargins, and in the 220 yard hurdles, and the<br />\nhalf mile, the first and second men were but<br />\ninches apart. The unexpected came early in<br />\nthe meet, when Maynard, our freshman highjumper, jumped at least 3 inches higher than<br />\never before, and cleared 5 feet 9 inches.<br />\nMaynard possesses plenty of the required grit,<br />\nand, if he works hard to develope better form,<br />\nshould break the Hopkins record before he<br />\nleaves the University. Maynard's form is<br />\nvery ragged at present, and it is a wonder that<br />\nhe gets over the bar as well as he does.<br />\nStewart came back to his own in the halfmile and was excellent, considering the strong<br />\nwind blowing up the back stretch. Mears<br />\nran a plucky race in the half-mile, and should<br />\nreceive part of the credit for the victory.<br />\nThe individual honors went to Perce with<br />\ntwenty points, Randolph, of Virginia, being<br />\nsecond with thirteen.

Although<br />\nthe score was 8 to 8, the game was by no<br />\nmeans one-sided, and the Black and Blue had<br />\nto work harder than at any time this season,<br />\nwith the exception of the Mt. Washington<br />\ngame. It was, perhaps, fifteen or twenty<br />\nminutes before Frank landed the ball in the<br />\nnet<br />\nThe game was full of rough play, Swarthmore being responsible for the major part of<br />\nit. Instead of trying to pick the ball up, they<br />\nplayed more field hockey, and slashed most<br />\nwildly, sometimes with result, and again without result. Had they played more cleanly,<br />\nthey might have had a better score to show.<br />\nThe whole team played hard and as one man.<br />\nThey were in excellent physical condition,<br />\nand their team work showed the effect of hard<br />\npractice all through the winter. The passing<br />\nwas accurate, on the whole, with the exception<br />\nof a few shots at goal; the body checking was<br />\ngood; and none of the fellows were run off<br />\ntheir feet. Frank was severely cut on the<br />\nhead in the second half, and forced to leave<br />\nthe field, his place being taken by Mathias.<br />\nA few moments later, Williams was ruled off<br />\nthe field for the entire game. At this time<br />\nthe score was 5 to 0 in our favor. William's<br />\nopponent, the Swarthmore out-home was<br />\nruled out until the next goal was shot, which<br />\nmade the score 6 to 0. Then the Swarthmore<br />\nman was allowed to resume his place on field,<br />\nbut Williams had to stay on the sidelines !<br />\nThis gave Swarthmore twelve men to our<br />\neleven. Not until they got the extra man in<br />\nthis fashion could Swathmore score at all.<br />\nYet, playing with eleven men against twelve,<br />\nthe Hopkins attack was able to score two goals.<br />\nShortly after, Breyer was temporarily ruled<br />\noff, and now, with twelve men to our ten, it<br />\ntook Swarthmore over five minutes to score.<br />\nThere is no doubt that, had we been able to<br />\nkeep our full team throughout, Swarthmore<br />\ncould never have scored. The defense played<br />\nlike a stone wall, and the men in Garnet and<br />\nWhite could not possibly get through for<br />\nclose shots. All their shots were long and<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nBlanck was right their with the goods. The<br />\nattack played a very fast game, and would<br />\nhave scored more in the second half had the<br />\ndefense not been up against such odds.<br />\nThere was a 'loyal bunch of old alumni<br />\npresent at the game, and their encouragement<br />\nand cheering helped the 'Varsity materially.<br />\nThis gives us the championship of the Southern<br />\nDivision of the Lacrosse League, which practically means the championship of the country,<br />\nfor the teams of the Northern Division are not<br />\nof the calibre of the teams of the Southern<br />\nDivision.

But she had treated him with indifference. They had not quarrelled\u2014a lover's<br />\nquarrel is easily made up\u2014no, the determination of the young man was not the result of<br />\nmomentary displeasure. For months she had<br />\nbeen playing with his fine manly feelings, and<br />\nso had at length crushed the affection she had<br />\nonce inspired. Willingly would she have<br />\nowned her real feelings for him, but she feared<br />\nby such an acknowledgment to lose the host<br />\nof admirers, by whom she was surrounded.<br />\nNow, however, the real truth impressed<br />\nitself upon her.

And can you, knowing that the hope of years has been ruthlessly<br />\ncrushed, that I have loved you since boyhood<br />\nand fancied that you might one day become<br />\nfixed in your feelings, ask why I am wretched?<br />\nBut, Alice, it is useless to protact a meeting<br />\nwhich must needs be distasteful to you and<br />\npainful to us both.

You are changed, but to me that<br />\nis of little or no consequence since there are<br />\nmore than enough who will gladly supply<br />\nyour place, and may you also have the good<br />\nfortune to find some one who will make you<br />\nhappy.\"<br />\n\"Never, never,\" interrupted he, with<br />\nenergy, \"no one can ever fill up the void<br />\nwhich your heartless conduct has left.

We meet again this evening.\"<br />\nAlice, on taking leave of her rejected lover,<br />\nfelt some compunction for her past conduct;<br />\nand no sooner had she reached her apartment<br />\nthan, throwing herself into a chair, she gave<br />\nway to a passionate burst of feeling. It was<br />\nuseless to suppose that Davenport would alter<br />\nhis determinations; his mind was well regulated, and she was convinced that his decision<br />\non this point, as on all others, had been the<br />\nresult of mature, deliberation and of the conviction as to its wisdom. Yet notwithstanding<br />\nthis she ventured to hope that she might<br />\nspeedily regain and ultimately retain his confidence.<br />\nThere was to be a party in the evening and<br />\nshe resolved to regulate her conduct in such<br />\nwise as must please him. Many of her flattering admirers would attend the function, and<br />\nCharles should see how lightly she valued<br />\ntheir attentions.<br />\nAt the commencement of the entertainment<br />\nall went as Alice had planned, but gradually<br />\nand unconsciously yielding to her dominating<br />\npassion for admiration she again became the<br />\ngayest of the gay. True, when her eyes met<br />\nthose of Charles she seemed abashed and her<br />\nguilt betrayed itself in her altered countenance<br />\nand embarrased manner.<br />\nBut genuine as this emotion may have been,<br />\nit quickly passed, and she again joined in the<br />\nlight laugh and the joyous song.<br />\nDavenport left the party early, alleging as<br />\nan excuse for his abrupt departure, the recur-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nrence of a violent headache. Alice knew the<br />\nreal cause and this too had its momentary<br />\neffect upon her.<br />\nThat evening passed, and the next day<br />\nfound Charles many miles from his uncle's and<br />\nfrom all that had for years constituted his<br />\nhappiness.<br />\nCharles, who, it may readilly be supposed<br />\nnever once forgot his misfortune, revisted his<br />\nuncle some years later. He found Alice still<br />\nunmarried, and but little changed. A few<br />\ndays after his arrival, she gave him to understand that she recently had a very advantageous<br />\noffer of marriage made her, upon which she<br />\nwould like to have his opinion.<br />\n`.1 Miss Hunter will do best to consult her<br />\nown heart\u2014if indeed she yet has one; and if<br />\nMajor M\u2014 is such as to merit her esteem,<br />\nand if her acceptance of him will further her<br />\nfather's interests, I should advise her to give<br />\nhis proposals her most serious and disinterested<br />\nconsideration,\" was his reply.<br />\nAlice, tired of still being Miss Hunter at<br />\ntwenty-eight, and thinking only of the rank<br />\nand pretentious of Major M\u2014, accepted<br />\nhim.<br />\nCharles had long been declining in health,<br />\nand to see her whom he still loved with all<br />\nthe ardor of youth, cast her lot with a man<br />\nwhom nature had endowed with the mind and<br />\nmanners of a profligate, was more than he<br />\ncould bare.<br />\nMajor M\u2014 was tyrannical and jealous,<br />\nAlice still self-willed, and the end of such a<br />\nunion could only be misery. No sooner was<br />\nCharles apprised of the unhappiness of Alice<br />\nthan his suffering plainly proved that he<br />\ncould not long sustain the burden of this last<br />\nand greatest affliction. Within a few weeks<br />\nhe was too ill to leave his room and not until<br />\nthen did Alice venture to approach him.<br />\n\"Charles,\" said she one morning, how<br />\nyour illness grieves me! it is I who have<br />\ncaused all you have suffered; but,neglected by<br />\nmy husband, I too am unhappy. I wantonly<br />\ndashed the cup of happiness from my lips, and<br />\nyou are avenged.\"<br />\nHush, Alice, do not arraign the providence<br />\nwhich has directed all things for our good.<br />\nWe have both sinned, but I am convinced that<br />\nwe have been punished on this earth for eternal<br />\ngood hereafter. Had you received my affection<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nwith reciprocal feeling, I might have been too<br />\nhappy, and in the gift have forgotten the<br />\ngiver, and thus have sinned past all hope of<br />\nforgiveness. But I forget, Alice, that you<br />\nhave been here some time, and that Major<br />\nM\u2014 may be angry at your long delay. Do<br />\nnot expose yourself to anything disagreeable<br />\non my account, but leave me to my good<br />\nnurse. \"May God bless and reward you for<br />\nyour kindness.\"<br />\n\"Charles, my husband has been absent<br />\nsome time and can not possibly return for<br />\nsome days. Let me have the only consolation<br />\nI may now hope to enjoy\u2014that of administering to the comfort of others. If,therefore, my<br />\npresence is not painful to you, let me remain.\"<br />\n\"Painful ? no; on the contrary it is a greater<br />\nblessing than I could have hoped for. But,<br />\nAlice, be composed, learn to feel as well as to<br />\nsay, God's will be done.\" As he spoke his<br />\nvoice failed, and Alice beheld with alarm his<br />\naltered countenance.<br />\n\"You grow worse! what shall I get for<br />\nyou?\" \"Nothing,\" faintly answered he,<br />\n\"the morning has changed\u2014I feel chilly.\"<br />\nAlice gazed at his pale face with fear and<br />\nbewilderment, but felt some relief when she<br />\nperceived an unvented brightness overspread<br />\nhis countenance. He smiled, and she supposed he had revived.<br />\n\"Alice, go summon some one\u2014I am<br />\ndying\u2014I cannot suffer you to be alone at this<br />\nawful moment\u2014awful to survivors\u2014but 0,<br />\nhow blissful to those who rest in God. May<br />\nhe heap blessings upon you.\" As he concluded, he again smiled, fixed his eyes upon<br />\nher with an expression of the wildest ecstacy,<br />\nand his soul embarked upon its mysterious<br />\nvoyage to that \"undiscovered country, from<br />\nwhose bourn no traveler returns.\"<br />\nThe acute bodily and mental agony of Alice<br />\nmust be felt rather than described, Her years<br />\nwere unmarked by either pleasure or comfort<br />\ntill she was released from,the bonds of marriage<br />\nby the sudden and unlooked for death of her<br />\nhusband\u2014an event which had been wished<br />\nrather than hoped for; for it would have been<br />\ncontrary to nature had she not felt relief from<br />\nhis oppression.

The majority of them indulge themselves in that very current delusion that Hopkins is purely a medical<br />\nschool. Here is an extract from a Canadian paper.<br />\n\"Johns Hopkins University is to be complimented for one<br />\nthing at least. It does not allow its representative paper to talk<br />\nshop. We are accustomed to consider that University as affording<br />\nthe best medical facilities on the continent; yet in the January publication there is no mention of a medical topic; neither is there even a<br />\njoke which suggests the dissecting room. From the contents of the<br />\njournal the casual reader might conclude that the institution afforded better facilities for a<br />\npost-graduate course in athletics than in medicine. All the prose articles save one are on<br />\nathletics, and the solitary exception is a selection on monuments. We hope that it is not<br />\ndeemed a fitting conclusion to the preceding discourses on athletic topics.\"<br />\nIn another issue of the same paper they quote those enthusiastic verses which so ably<br />\npadded out the NEWS-LETTUR in time of need.<br />\n\"They do more than study medicine at Johns Hopkins University. Listen to this:<br />\nRosy-red lips, and honey-dew eyes,<br />\nTwo arching eyebrows, mockingly wise,<br />\nChin with a dimple, laughing and gay!<br />\nPearl among pearls!<br />\nQuestion\u2014Is it a co-educational institution or not?\"<br />\nBut the amazing part of the whole business is that the women had not at that time<br />\nbeen admitted to Hopkins. Now the query is whether or no the opinion of women will<br />\nchange when they do conic next fall. Will we still cling to the verses of S. C. C. or will we<br />\nembrace the \"vampirical\" style of Rudyard Kipling\u2014\"the rag and bone and hank of hair\u2014<br />\nbut the fool he called her his lady fair?\" This is not a question to be discussed in Gordons<br />\n'Undergraduate Club,\" nor yet in its annex the Barber Shop\u2014in short to be discussed by the<br />\nordinary mortal, but rather to the non-cigarette smoking elements\u2014the debating team and<br />\nthose enthusiastic women seekers who lounge in Levering Hall to watch the girls go home<br />\nfrom school and Kernan's. Still, \"Better be jocund with the fruitful grape than sadden after<br />\nnone\u2014or bitter fruit.''<br />\nV VV<br />\n11014)*(0,<br />\n*WSW*<br />\nVVVVV<br /><br />\n4NO,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nHE undergraduate spectators at the Lacrosse games this spring have<br />\nbeen divided into two parts, those who root and those who do not.<br />\nThe latter section is composed of a wee small band of devotes of the<br />\nfair sex, who are seen regularly every Saturday in faithful attendance<br />\nupon the several objects of their adoration; and this band is at times<br />\nsabject to the severest recrimination from their friends of the cheering section.<br /><br />\nWhether such epithets as \"a set of durned fussers\"<br /><br />\nare inspired by envy of the happy lot of these same fussers it is not<br />\nfor the NEWS-LETTER to decide. But it is at least open to dispute whether the boys on the<br />\nthe team do not get as much inspiration from the fair ladies in the grandstand as from the<br />\nconcerted numbers rendered on the bleachers.<br />\nThere is a class of students, fortunately small, who have neither the inclination to bring<br />\na girl, (or perhaps it is that no girl has the inclination to be brought) nor the energy to get<br />\nout and root. Such objectionable people wonder disconsolately around like disembodied<br />\nspirits, and find shelter where they are not wanted--among the aforesaid \"durned<br />\nfussers.\"<br /><br />\nIn little Ross street on any morning bright,<br />\nThere's a little band of fellows to be seen\u2014<br />\nThey're so very interested that the chance spectator might<br />\nJust speculate a bit on what they mean,<br />\nBy standing on the curb-stone and tossing o'er the street<br />\nAlmost the smallest coin in the land<br />\nThough it isn't edifying, come let us take a seat,<br />\nAnd watch this little nickle-tossing band.<br /><br />\nSing a song of nickles!<br />\nMake the money spin!<br />\nFour and twenty fellows<br />\nBaking in the tin!<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nOn Monday, May 20, 1907, the annual<br />\nmeeting of the Musical Clubs, for the purpose<br />\nof electing officers for the coming year, was<br />\nheld in the Trophy Room.<br />\nA large and enthusiastic number attended<br />\nthe meeting,and the voting on the officers was<br />\nvery exciting and close,<br />\nThe first order of business was the report of<br />\nthe manager for the year past.<br />\nWhen the members recovered from the<br />\neffect of this report the meeting proceeded to<br />\nthe election of officers.<br />\nAfter a spirited ballot the following were<br />\nelected :<br />\nPresident, L. W. Perce, Jr.<br />\nManager, F. B. Pedrick.<br />\nLeader of the Glee Club, C. F. Ranft.<br />\nLeader of Mandolin Club, H. K. Hughes.<br />\nOn the motion of Mr. Bloomfield, the<br />\nelection of an assistant manager was posponed<br />\nuntil the fall. It was proposed that the<br />\ncandidates be made to show their merit before<br />\nanyone be chosen for the much esteemed<br />\nposition.<br /><br />\nby no means shows how close the contest was,<br />\nfor it was only by narrow margins that Hopkins<br />\nwon. The hundred and two hundred and<br />\ntwenty yard dashes were won by the narrowest<br />\nmargins, and in the 220 yard hurdles, and the<br />\nhalf mile, the first and second men were but<br />\ninches apart. The unexpected came early in<br />\nthe meet, when Maynard, our freshman highjumper, jumped at least 3 inches higher than<br />\never before, and cleared 5 feet 9 inches.<br />\nMaynard possesses plenty of the required grit,<br />\nand, if he works hard to develope better form,<br />\nshould break the Hopkins record before he<br />\nleaves the University. Maynard's form is<br />\nvery ragged at present, and it is a wonder that<br />\nhe gets over the bar as well as he does.<br />\nStewart came back to his own in the halfmile and was excellent, considering the strong<br />\nwind blowing up the back stretch.

Although<br />\nthe score was 8 to 8, the game was by no<br />\nmeans one-sided, and the Black and Blue had<br />\nto work harder than at any time this season,<br />\nwith the exception of the Mt. Washington<br />\ngame. It was, perhaps, fifteen or twenty<br />\nminutes before Frank landed the ball in the<br />\nnet<br />\nThe game was full of rough play, Swarthmore being responsible for the major part of<br />\nit. Instead of trying to pick the ball up, they<br />\nplayed more field hockey, and slashed most<br />\nwildly, sometimes with result, and again without result. Had they played more cleanly,<br />\nthey might have had a better score to show.<br />\nThe whole team played hard and as one man.<br />\nThey were in excellent physical condition,<br />\nand their team work showed the effect of hard<br />\npractice all through the winter. The passing<br />\nwas accurate, on the whole, with the exception<br />\nof a few shots at goal; the body checking was<br />\ngood; and none of the fellows were run off<br />\ntheir feet. Frank was severely cut on the<br />\nhead in the second half, and forced to leave<br />\nthe field, his place being taken by Mathias.<br />\nA few moments later, Williams was ruled off<br />\nthe field for the entire game. At this time<br />\nthe score was 5 to 0 in our favor. William's<br />\nopponent, the Swarthmore out-home was<br />\nruled out until the next goal was shot, which<br />\nmade the score 6 to 0. Then the Swarthmore<br />\nman was allowed to resume his place on field,<br />\nbut Williams had to stay on the sidelines !<br />\nThis gave Swarthmore twelve men to our<br />\neleven. Not until they got the extra man in<br />\nthis fashion could Swathmore score at all.<br />\nYet, playing with eleven men against twelve,<br />\nthe Hopkins attack was able to score two goals.<br />\nShortly after, Breyer was temporarily ruled<br />\noff, and now, with twelve men to our ten, it<br />\ntook Swarthmore over five minutes to score.<br />\nThere is no doubt that, had we been able to<br />\nkeep our full team throughout, Swarthmore<br />\ncould never have scored.

But I forget, Alice, that you<br />\nhave been here some time, and that Major<br />\nM\u2014 may be angry at your long delay.

On the whole we are<br />\ninclined to believe the book is neither better Expert Repairer of all String Instruments<br />\nnor worse than its many predecessors. Its<br />\n306 N.

Liberty Street, Baltimore<br />\nAthletics, Histories and all the usual ''truck''<br />\nof year books. These write-ups were in conception good, but unfortunately in execution<br />\nthey are for the most part poor.

On the other hand,<br />\nHats, Umbrellas, Canes, Hand Satchels<br />\nbad jokes are much worse than none. Indeed<br />\nMark Cross Co.'s London Gloves<br />\nthere's no such thing as a \"bad joke;\" a<br />\njoke's a joke or it is not, and, with the aid of<br />\n11 NORTH CHARLES STREET<br />\na microscope, we have been unable to detect a<br />\njoke in Hullabaloo-1907.\"<br /><br />\nChas.
