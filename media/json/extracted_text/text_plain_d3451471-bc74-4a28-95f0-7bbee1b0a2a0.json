Amidst a dinner<br />\nof taco salad and cups of soda,<br />\nthey gave us the following<br />\ninterview:<br />\nN-L:In terms of student involvement, community involvement, financial solvency, and<br />\noverall smoothness, how successful will this year's Fair be<br />\nrelative to past years' Fairs?<br />\n<br />\nThere are no junk vendors, just high quality<br />\ncrafts.<br />\n\u2014Mel Coursey<br />\nI think a lot of [faculty]<br />\ndo enjoy the Fair itself,<br />\nespecially when we talk<br />\nto other administrators and they say,<br />\n\"This year's Spring Fair<br />\nshould be really good.\"<br />\n\u2014Donald Chang<br />\nCoursey: Very successful in a<br />\nlot of ways. The Fair has done<br />\nvery well for itself financially,<br />\nmainly because of our arts and<br />\ncrafts, food, and program committees, which are our chief<br />\nmoneymakers. We've tried to put<br />\nall that money back into the Fair.<br />\nChang: As far as community<br />\ninvolvement, we have tried to<br />\npublicize the Fair through radio,<br />\nTV and the newspapers. The<br />\nMayor himself will open the Fair.<br />\n<br />\nThe Fair is supposed to break<br />\neven and we will be able to do<br />\nthat because all committees have<br />\nraised more than we anticipated.<br />\nWe are also getting elementary<br />\nstudents to participate in the<br />\nSafari contest and also in the<br />\nopening ceremony with 3,000<br />\nballoons.<br />\nN-L:Last year, the Fair was<br />\nheld the second weekend of<br />\nApril. Why is it being held the<br />\nfirst weekend of May this year?<br />\nChang: We don't have a lot of<br />\ndates to work with. We have to<br />\nwork within Homecoming, the<br />\nMCAT weekend, Passover and<br />\nEaster weekend. We found out<br />\nwe had only two weekends to<br />\nwork with, and that it was either<br />\ngoing to be April 11, 12 and 13,<br />\nor May 1, 2 and 3, and the Student Council chose the May 1, 2<br />\nand 3.<br />\nWhen we were selected to run<br />\nSpring Fair, we had a choice to<br />\nmove it back, but we decided it<br />\nwould be a much better date on<br />\nMay 1, 2 and 3, with a lot less<br />\npeople studying.<br />\nCoursey: The only real problem with the May 1 date us that<br />\nit conflicts with the Towsontowne<br />\nFestival, but we thought it would<br />\nbe much better for the students if<br />\nit were held May 1. It's right<br />\nbefore Reading Week and it gives<br />\nthem plenty of time before finals<br />\nto prepare. We're also hoping for<br />\nbetter weather.<br />\nN-L:Were there any major<br />\nunforseen problems or successes encountered in preparation for the Fair.<br />\nCoursey:There were no real<br />\nproblems I could think of offhand \u2014 nothing major. We consider our two biggest successes<br />\ngetting the 10-K run back and the<br />\nconcert.<br />\nChang: We also got private<br />\nsponsors for the 10-K, which<br />\nreally helped a lot.<br />\nN-L: In recent Fairs, there<br />\nhave been complaints that the<br />\narts and crafts seemed to have<br />\na flea-market type of nature.<br />\nWhat steps have you taken to<br />\nlimit the commercial nature of<br />\nthe Fair?<br />\nCoursey: Getting away from<br />\nthe flea-market type of atmosphere is what they tried to do<br />\nlast year, and they really did suc-<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter File<br />\n<br />\nMel Coursey and Donald Chang, the co-chairmen of Spring Fair.<br />\nceed.

There<br />\nare no junk vendors, just high<br />\nquality crafts.<br />\nN-L: A Fair concert will be<br />\nheld for the first time since<br />\n1984. How was the return of the<br />\n<br />\nconcert arranged?<br />\nCoursey: We tried getting the<br />\nconcert through a different route<br />\nthis year than they have in the<br />\npast couple of years. It's just too<br />\nbig a burden to put on ourselves \u2014 if the concert didn't go<br />\nwell, the whole Fair would<br />\ncollapse.<br />\nWe tried to get an outside promoter to run the concert, and he's<br />\none that's worked with student<br />\nactivities in the past. He did Pat<br />\n<br />\nMetheny in Shriver Hall, and the<br />\nRoches last year. We asked him<br />\nif he could arrange a deal for 500<br />\ntickets reserved solely for<br />\nstudents, at a five dollar discount.<br />\nIn return, we publicized it to<br />\nthe Hopkins community and tried<br />\nto sell those 500 tickets.

Vendors selling imported crafts will not be at the<br />\nFair, though over 100 other vendors will be participating. Still,<br />\nPeppe said, \"We've turned down<br />\n<br />\nmore this year than we have in a<br />\nwhile.\"<br />\nIn addition to raising the quality<br />\nof the crafts, Peppe, who chaired<br />\nthe committee with Carolyn<br />\nWillis, also tried to make the exhibits more interesting for the<br />\ncrowds.<br />\n\"We are trying to get craftsmen who do live demonstrations,\" she said. \"We'd like to<br />\nmake it interesting for the people<br />\nwhile they're walking around.<br />\nWe're trying to make it more active.\" Live demonstrations will<br />\ninclude a glass blower, a craftsman who writes poetry, African<br />\ninstruments, and a candlemaker<br />\nwho reads tarot cards.<br />\n\"We're trying to get the school<br />\nmore involved,\" said Peppe.<br />\nMembers of the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences are<br />\nselling photos of places they have<br />\nvisited, and are also selling<br />\nmicroscope pictures of rocks.<br />\nThe Maryland Art Institute will<br />\nhave a stand.

The past couple of<br />\nyears that I've been at Hopkins,<br />\nit's been an energizing kind of<br />\nfeeling, because it heralds in the<br />\nnew season and also I think that<br />\nmost of the kids on campus are<br />\nlooking forward to summer, and<br />\nthat kind of excitement is contagious. It wasn't so long ago that<br />\nI was on a similar campus looking forward to summer.<br />\nAs far as the role that it plays<br />\nto Baltimore, besides it being a<br />\nseasonal rite, it's important for<br />\nfairs not to be just urban\u2014steamy<br />\nsidewalks, garbage.

Having<br />\nknown Vandana for a while (we<br />\nwent to high school together, so<br />\nI really should have been on my<br />\nguard), being committed to committing academic suicide this<br />\nsemester, and just being a<br />\ngenerally warm, compassionate,<br />\nintelligent, generous(5' 10\", 160<br />\nlbs., brown hair/eyes, 19 years<br />\nold, 235-1303) person, I offered<br />\nto help out. \"Write anything you<br />\nwant, it doesn't matter,\" Vandana said, not realizing that she<br />\nwould later come to regret these<br />\nwords.<br />\nI first called Claire Battistella,<br />\nFair Games Co-Chair. Ms. Battistella reported that there would<br />\nbe about thirty teams participating<br />\nin the Games. She said that the<br />\nGames (which start at 1:00 on<br />\nGarland Field, Saturday and Sunday) would be in keeping with the<br />\nSafari theme, and that she thought<br />\nthe Costume Relay would be a<br />\ndefinite highlight. When I asked<br />\nfor a creative assessment of the<br />\n<br />\nSafari Games, Ms. Battistella<br />\nclaimed that as a Chemical<br />\nEngineer, she was not a good person to ask, and directed me to her<br />\nco-chair Julie Marrone (Political<br />\nEconomy). \"That's a more<br />\ncreative field,\" I was told. I had<br />\na feeling, after putting down the<br />\nphone, that Claire had just proven her creativity.<br />\nMs. Marrone has done the Fair<br />\nGames ever since they were<br />\nstarted, and still finds the antics<br />\nhilarious to watch. She promises<br />\nthat while Master of Ceremonies<br />\nSteve Schiller is a comedian in his<br />\nown right, the real comedians are<br />\nthe participants. During the<br />\nCostume Relay, competitors<br />\ndress up (and undress) as Safari<br />\nGuides. \"The clothes are really,<br />\nreally big.

I informed her that she should come and<br />\nwatch me when I get up in the<br />\nmorning (her description seemed<br />\n<br />\nfairly accurate).<br />\nNext I phoned Ellen Zimmerman, Special Events Co-Chair.<br />\nMs. Zimmerman informed me<br />\nabout the Balloon Ascension,<br />\nwith Ken Matz and Sally Thorner<br />\nas masters of ceremony (Du<br />\nBurns couldn't make it).

We<br />\nweren't really part of the community, and didn't want to be. It<br />\npleases me that the student body<br />\nat Hopkins is very active in the<br />\ncommunity. And that works both<br />\nways, by the way. When you<br />\nhave news happening on your<br />\ncampus, whether its good news<br />\nlike the Fair, which we're very<br />\nheavily involved in, as you know,<br />\nor if its the Apartheid situation,<br />\nwe're there for each other, and I<br />\nthink that that's a very healthy<br />\nrelationship. Before I was really<br />\nrecognized in this town, I was<br />\nrecognized by Hopkins, so I feel<br />\nlike I owe you guys something,<br />\nand I'm going to continue, as long<br />\nas you allow me to, to be a part<br />\nof your campus.<br />\nAs for my advice to students<br />\nwhose first Fair it is\u2014 make sure<br />\nto try the sushi.<br />\n<br />\n10-K Kicks Off<br />\nby Howell Sasser<br />\nAfter a two-year hiatus, the<br />\n10-K Run is back as a part of<br />\nSpring Fair.

The stories that generated<br />\nheat six months ago have lost their pizzazz. And<br />\nthe comments we've made on these pages have,<br />\nfor the most part, been forgotten or ignored.<br />\nIn one last-ditch effort to rekindle some<br />\nsparks, we've collected some of our favorite<br />\nremarks over the course of the year.<br />\nAnd so, we give you, the final word. . . .<br />\nThe Shanty-Ban: In the end, if the new<br />\nshanty-ban is enforced, the Administration may<br />\nfind itself continuing what the firebombers<br />\nstarted\u2014using force and violence to silence the<br />\nopinions of others. (Sept. 12)<br />\nFirebombing: We commend the University<br />\nfor trying to discipline D.U. When the elected<br />\npresident of a fraternity publicly takes the lead<br />\nin planning a terrorist attack and nobody in the<br />\nhouse tries to stop him, the fraternity should<br />\nindeed be held partially accountable. It's absurd that Delta Upsilon International doesn't<br />\nagree. (Sept. 19)<br />\nAlcohol Policy: Every year at about this time,<br />\nthe Inter Fraternity Council has a meeting with<br />\nHomewood administrators. And every year, the<br />\nI.F.C. shudders from the Administration's fireand-brimstone prophesies about enforcement of<br />\nthe ever changing alcohol policy. This year has<br />\nbeen no exception.<br />\nThe new measures for the enforcement of the<br />\nUniversity's alcohol policy point to a problem<br />\nof growing concern. During the last three or<br />\nfour years since the state changed its drinking<br />\nage from 18 to 21, the University has taken<br />\nupon itself the obligation of actively enforcing<br />\nMaryland State drinking laws through every<br />\nmeans it has at its disposal. Fraternities have<br />\nbeen fined, placed on social probation, threatened with the loss of pledge classes, etc. . . . Now<br />\nthe University seems ready to recruit a network<br />\nof spies to infiltrate parties. The University has<br />\ngone too far. (Sept. 26)<br />\nShanty Arrests: This morning, an impending<br />\nsequel to Monday's ignoble events seems to<br />\nhave been averted. Reason has apparently<br />\ntriumphed over the brute force tactics used<br />\nearlier this week.<br />\nWe can only hope that the latest decision to<br />\npermit the construction of safe protest shanties<br />\nwill foreshadow a climate of cooperation between protestors and the University and prevent<br />\nunnecessary and mutually unproductive<br />\nhostilities in the future. (Oct. 3)<br />\nWJHU Power Boost: In the wake of the<br />\nUniversity's less than electrifying planning of<br />\nthe the station's power boost, perhaps a few<br />\nthings can be learned. First, in planning a project, particularly a technical one, discussion<br />\nwith technical advisors from the earliest<br />\nmoments of project planning needs to take<br />\nplace.[WJHU General Manager David] Creagh<br />\nhas continually maintained that developing a<br />\nstation like the new WJHU takes at least a year<br />\nand a half to two years to complete. His projection seems reasonable.<br />\nWhy then was the University community told<br />\ninitially that the entire process would take only three months? Either a lack of technical consultation or complete disregard for technical advice must have been at work. (Oct. 17)<br />\nDean Departure: As the top men in the<br />\n<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences (the largest<br />\nacademic division at Homewood), Fisher and<br />\nCrenson have done an excellent job in directing and coordinating a vast array of academic<br />\ndepartments. Furthermore, both deans have<br />\nbeen remarkably accessible and eager to work<br />\nwith students.<br />\nIt's difficult to single out any specific achievement exclusively attributable to the work of the<br />\ndeparting deans. However, that probably is as<br />\nit should be. After all, the mark of many good<br />\nand efficient administrators is the lack of a<br />\ndistinctive mark. (Oct. 24)<br />\nM.S.E.: Already, some departments have indicated that their programs are suffering from<br />\na lack of literary resources. If those claims are<br />\ntrue, and they probably are, the University<br />\nshould be outraged.<br />\nNo top-rated prestigious research institution<br />\ncan function without a top-rated prestigious<br />\nlibrary. If Hopkins is indeed dedicated to the<br />\nacquisition and dissemination of knowledge, it<br />\nneeds to make a much stronger commitment to<br />\nthe improvement of the M.S.E. Library. (Oct.<br />\n24)<br />\nCarrier Station: Ever since the plans to hire<br />\na professional staff for WJHU were announced three years ago, proposals have been kicked around to establish a student-run alternative<br />\nstation to recapture the spirit of the \"Old<br />\nWJHU.\" Unfortunately, though, the glory days<br />\nare over, and such plans seem to be more the<br />\nwhimsy of a handful of die-hard WJHUers than<br />\na realistic strategy for the disbursement of the<br />\nSAC dollar . . . . (Nov. 21)<br />\nOrientation Report: Something sneaky is<br />\nafoot.<br />\nLast Friday at a 7:30 a.m. closed \"breakfast\"<br />\nmeeting, Dean of Students Chris Colombo<br />\npresented the Report of the Orientation Review<br />\nCommittee to the few Council members who<br />\nmanaged to attend. The report, which has been<br />\nin the works since December, not surprisingly<br />\nproposes recommendations which are unprecedented in the recent history of Homewood<br />\nstudent activities. . . .<br />\nThen as suddenly as the report appeared, it<br />\nfaded into the twilight zone of the Homewood<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nColombo told us early this week that the<br />\nreport had become an \"internal document.\"<br />\nHowever prudent the recommendations of the<br />\nreport may be (and we do not believe they are<br />\nprudent) one must wonder, why they were<br />\nscrapped almost overnight before the community had the opportunity to evaluate the work of<br />\nthe Orientation Review COmmittee. (Mar. 6)<br />\nTerwilliger: This week, the News-Letter<br />\nreceived a second letter from Joseph Terwilliger<br />\nin which he explains that his intention in writing<br />\nhis first letter of February 20 was not to discuss<br />\nthe Holocasut or John Demjanjuk, but to asses<br />\nthe vigor with which the University community would protect the right of someone to express \"neo-Nazi propaganda.\"<br />\nWe are outraged and ashamed.<br />\nTerwilliger abused this forum. While we are<br />\ncommitted to almost unrestrained expression of<br />\nconscientiously-held ideas on these pages, we<br />\nfeel no responsibility whatsoever to print lies.<br />\nThere is little we can do to retract the letter<br />\nthat was printed two weeks ago. But we do<br />\napologize to the community for being gullible<br />\nenough to trust Terwilliger. (Mar. 26)<br />\n<br />\nQuod est demonstratum.<br />\n<br />\nYet again our anti-Apartheid<br />\nshanty shares the fate of the<br />\nsquatter camp known as<br />\n\"Crossroads\" outside Capetown,<br />\nSouth Africa. Last time, for the<br />\numpteenth time, anonymous<br />\nstudents<br />\n(they're<br />\ncalled<br />\n\"vigilantes\" in S.A.) have taken<br />\nthe law into their own hands and<br />\ndestroyed our small form of<br />\nresistance to the Apartheid<br />\nsystem.<br />\nLike the Botha regime in the<br />\nrazing of Crossroads, the<br />\nHopkins Administration looks on<br />\nwithout critical comment.

It is,<br />\nafter all, a pretty qualified bunch.<br />\nThe question is whether or not<br />\nthe Administration recognizes<br />\nthis. Spring Fair is the largest<br />\nstudent-run event, but Orientation<br />\nand the MSE Symposium are of<br />\nequal importance, and the former<br />\nis being discussed to the detriment of students. The autonomy<br />\nand authority granted to<br />\nundergraduates are a privelege<br />\nand responsibility. This is usually overlooked. In order to<br />\npreserve the best student-run activities, students must not only get<br />\ninvolved, but they also ought to<br />\nthank those other students who<br />\nhave organized films, lectures,<br />\nparties and Spring Fairs for the<br />\nbenefit of all.

The events affected students, faculty members,<br />\nand administrators, and some of them changed, or will<br />\nchange, the nature of Hopkins.<br />\nTo present the issues in retrospect, we have written brief<br />\nsummaries describing the issue as it developed, and have<br />\nselected quotations that we believe accurately reflect the<br />\nnature and significance of the issues presented.<br />\nThe following is the list:<br />\n<br />\nStudent Activism<br />\nIt should come as no surprise that our top story for the<br />\n1986-87 academic year was<br />\nthe arrest and trial of three<br />\nHopkins protest shanty<br />\nfirebombers, the controversy<br />\nsurrounding the construction<br />\nof shanties in particular, and<br />\nthe issues of divestment and freedom of expression in<br />\ngeneral.<br />\nSo much happened with regard to the activities of the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa, the College<br />\nRepublicans, and miscellaneous splinter groups that it<br />\nwould be impossible to outline those events individually<br />\nhere.

Archer, the Hopkins graduate student who<br />\nwas burned during the May 24, 1986 firebomb attack on<br />\nan anti-Apartheid shanty, May 25, 1986: \"I'm just happy that we hadn't gotten in the [sleeping] bags. I don't<br />\nthink we'd have gotten out.\"<br />\nRussell Abrams, one of the three Hopkins students convicted of arson and conspiracy to commit arson, May 24,<br />\n1986: \"Don't take me to the police.

The vigor of the reaction against the University's aberrant action is evidence that those commitments<br />\nremain firm throughout much of the University<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\n<br />\nFlathman Report<br />\nThe second biggest story of<br />\n1986-87 is the publication of<br />\nthe Report of the Committee<br />\non Freedom of Expression,<br />\nalso known as the Flathman<br />\nReport.

Those who expect a profound statement, a witty script, or<br />\neven a plot, stop reading here.<br />\nCelebration aspires to nothing<br />\nmore than a pastiche of past Barnstormer musicals and a collection<br />\nof songs from great American<br />\nBroadway musicals. Thirty people run around for two and a half<br />\nhours singing bits from Shenandoah or West Side Story. No, it's<br />\nnot a very thrilling idea. It's the<br />\nsort of thing they use as filler at<br />\nthe Tony Awards. But the Barnstormers carry it off with just the<br />\nkind of enthusiasm they also lack<br />\nat the Tony Awards. Overall,<br />\nthey manage to put on a good<br />\nshow.<br />\nWhen the naive newcomer to<br />\nthe world of the Barnstormers<br />\nasks if she can join the show,<br />\neverybody gripes about what a<br />\npain it all is. But why do they do<br />\nit? Suddenly the cast launches into \"Applause.\" The song talks of<br />\ntheir love of the spotlight and it<br />\nmanages to start changing tune.<br />\nSoon they are singing the tune of<br />\nFiddler on the Roofs \"Tradition\"\u2014only they use the word<br />\n\"applause\". They even carry it<br />\ninto Evita: 'Don't cry for me,just<br />\napplau-aud.\"<br />\nPeter Piccinini, who produced<br />\nthe show, comes on the PA and<br />\nannounces that he is now going to<br />\ntake us back over ten years of<br />\n<br />\nHopkins musicals. They begin in<br />\n1976 with Peanuts. Kathy Kennedy, as Lucy, is very appealing<br />\nin the song \"Little Known Facts\"<br />\nin which she explains the world<br />\nto Linus\u2014wrong, of course. It's<br />\na small number, relying more on<br />\nKathy's personality than her<br />\nvoice, but it comes off very well.<br />\nThe 1977 musical, The Fantasticks, yielded better songs than<br />\n\"I Can See It,\" but that was the<br />\nsong they chose. Michael Robinson has a sweet voice, and he<br />\nmostly drowned out Louis<br />\nKleiman, although the lighting<br />\nwas nifty. The 1978 Sondheim<br />\nmusical,<br />\nCompany,<br />\nwas<br />\nrepresented by \"You Could Drive<br />\nA _Person Crazy.\" Jill Austin,<br />\nBrigid Joyce and Julie Steigerwalt<br />\ndid a fair job doing-up the Andrews Sisters.<br />\nThe 1979 entry\u2014Anything<br />\nGoes\u2014was represented by the title song. A zippy little number,<br />\nit was sung with too little pep by<br />\nMarci Anderson. It was livened<br />\nup by some impressive tap dancing. The 1980 Music Man was<br />\ngiven a sour pick\u2014\"Till There<br />\nWas You\" is not one of this<br />\nmusical's better songs. The<br />\nmusical Pippin was represented<br />\nby \"Magic To Do.\"<br />\n\"Happily Ever After\", from<br />\nthe 1983 production of Once<br />\nUpon A Mattress, was fun. Kara<br />\nStein vamped it up as the princess<br />\nand gave the song inspiration.<br />\nHowever, at times the drummer<br />\ndrowned her out with his incongruous Keith Moon imitations. 1984's Hair was given two<br />\nsongs: \"Aquarius,\" sung by<br />\nLucinda Harper, and \"Hair,\"<br />\nsung by Greg Harmon. They<br />\ndidn't capture the spirit of the sixties, but it was a good try.<br />\nThe two songs culled from<br />\n1985's West Side Story were key<br />\nchoices: \"America\" was given a<br />\nclassy turn from Dede La Barre<br />\nand Emily Hamel. Hamel in particular was very good.. And<br />\n\"Tonight\" was given a decent<br />\njob, although the different groups<br />\nsinging didn't mesh all that well.<br />\nThree songs were performed<br />\nfrom last year's Godspell.<br />\nMichael Robinson sang a very<br />\n<br />\nsweet \"When Wilt Thou Save<br />\nThe People\" and Dale Bell joined him on \"We Beseech Thee.\"<br />\nThe highlight, though, was Alice<br />\nGriffin's rendition of \"Day by<br />\nDay.\" She set the tone, and when<br />\nthe cast joined in, it sounded just<br />\nright.<br />\nIntermission came, and a<br />\nchance to prepare the next batch<br />\nof costumes. The costumer,<br />\nIsabel Blevins, did a really terrific<br />\njob coming up with outfits for<br />\neveryone for every number. They<br />\nspruced up the dances, which, as<br />\nchoreographed by Ilona Kessell,<br />\nwere fairly entertaining but<br />\nnothing special. While synchronized well, the group dancing lacked spark. And there were<br />\na few people who seemed lost.<br />\nDuring intermission the audience had a chance to buy new<br />\nBarnstormer mugs, and to get set<br />\nfor Act Two's overview of<br />\nAmerican musicals. When the<br />\nlights went on, Peter Piccinini's<br />\ndisembodied voice promised to<br />\n\"journey with us, to a place in<br />\nevery town in America. . . to<br />\nBroadway.\" Besides the sudden<br />\nincrease in overbaked verbal flotsam, Act Two was even more exuberant than Act One.<br />\nA celebration of Broadway ensued, with \"Go Into Your<br />\nDance\" and \"42nd Street\"\u2014<br />\nsporting a Wayne-Newtonish<br />\nDale Bell. Then began the<br />\n\"Americana\" segment. Paying<br />\ntribute to dated musicals like<br />\nShowboat and Oklahoma is a nice<br />\nidea, but the song choice is<br />\nimportant.<br />\nSanjay Aggarwal came out to<br />\nperform what the Barnstormers<br />\nprobably expected to be a showstopping \"Old Man River.\" Aggarwal has a deep enough voice,<br />\nbut didn't have the range or emotion. It's a very intense song, and<br />\npeople make the mistake of<br />\nassuming only a bass or baritone<br />\ncan carry it off. If you have the<br />\nright feel, any bluesy voice can<br />\ncarry it off: the best version of<br />\n\"Old Man River\" you'll hear on<br />\na rock album was done by Rod<br />\nStewart on Jeff Beck's first<br />\nalbum. But Sanjay tried.<br />\nGreg Harmon performed \"Oh<br />\n<br />\nWhat a Beautiful Morning\" from<br />\nOklahoma as if he were singing<br />\nto his shoes. His voice kept losing it, and it was a disappointment, because Harmon can be so<br />\ndamn good. The next bright point<br />\noccurred two songs later, when<br />\nthe men, including Piccinini and<br />\nAndy<br />\ndirector<br />\ntechnical<br />\nAngelino, performed \"Next to<br />\nLovin'.\" It was very snappy, and<br />\nthe western clothes made you<br />\nforget that twenty minutes earlier<br />\neveryone was dressed in jazzy<br />\nblack-and-white outfits for the<br />\nBroadway numbers.<br />\nSkipping half a dozen songs<br />\nthat were listed in the program,<br />\nthe cast went to a few solos. Shari<br />\nRosen's \"Memories\"\u2014that one<br />\nmemorable song from Cats\u2014was<br />\na telling sign. She has a beautiful<br />\nvoice, but needed more practice<br />\nworking with the mike. Now,<br />\nwhy burden a performer with<br />\nelectronics, glitz and all those<br />\nthings that are superfluous to<br />\ntheater? Kathy Kennedy's \"What<br />\nI Did for Love\" was mike-less<br />\nand came off much better.<br />\nWhich is the problem with this<br />\nshow. Sure, director Linda Brody<br />\nis an old hand at this thing, with<br />\nlots of experience at Towsontowne Dinner Theatre. But producer Piccinini should leave this<br />\nglamour stuff to David Wolper.<br />\nWhen the cast settled for \"They<br />\nSly That Falling In Love Is<br />\nWonderful\" there was a moment<br />\nwhen angels might have flown in<br />\nfrom the wings. When the cast<br />\nwas all singing together on<br />\n\"Lullaby of Broadway\" it sounded great, but it was the small mowent that carried the show<br />\nthrough. When Lucy (Kathy Kennedy)explains to Linus what fire<br />\nhydrants are; when Michael<br />\nRobinson<br />\nstarts singing,<br />\n\"Tonight, tonight, won't be just<br />\nany night . . .\"A Celebration of<br />\nApplause is performed well, and<br />\nis a great way to spend two-anda-half hours immersed in extravagance. But next year, let's<br />\nhave a musical with a plot and<br />\ncharacters, and leave the tinsel to<br />\nHollywood. They've already<br />\nmade the sequel to That's<br />\nEntertainment.<br />\n<br />\nOn MOW:NTT or &institution<br />\nby Jay Lechtman<br />\n<br />\n\"Of the approximately<br />\n4,000,000 words in the English<br />\nlanguage, there are seven you<br />\ncan't say on television.\"<br />\nSince 1975, when the Federal<br />\nCommunications Commission<br />\nturned Geroge Carlin's famous<br />\nmonologue into broadcasting<br />\nregulation, there have been<br />\n\"seven dirty words\" that radio<br />\nand television stations have had<br />\nto watch out for.<br />\nNow the FCC says that those<br />\nstations have to watch out for<br />\n<br />\ntwo\u2014\"patently\"<br />\nand<br />\n\"offensive\".<br />\nThe meanings of the seven<br />\nwords were obvious, but the<br />\nmeaning of the two new words<br />\nisn't as clear. According to the<br />\nFCC, \"patently offensive\"<br />\nmeans anything deemed \"offensive by contemporary community standards for the broadcast<br />\nmedium.\"<br />\nWhat it means to the rest of us<br />\nis that a station can be fined or<br />\nprosecuted for broadcasting a<br />\nprogram on AIDS.<br />\nIt means that a station is forbidden from playing a song with sexually explicit lyrics, a song that<br />\ncan be purchased at the record<br />\n<br />\nstore across the street for the<br />\nprice of a 45 or LP.<br />\nIt means that the FCC can use<br />\nthis vague guideline to censor virtually any broadcaster\u2014from<br />\nmaverick DJ's like New York's<br />\nHoward Stern to mainstream personalities like Oprah, Phil<br />\nDonahue, or Dr. Ruth.<br />\nWhose standards are being<br />\nmeasured here, anyway?

True to<br />\nthe play, the cast gave an inspired<br />\nperformance centering around<br />\nShaw's conflict between souls<br />\nand profit. The play is especially<br />\nrelevant in the high-stakes<br />\n1980's, and the question of<br />\nmorality is just as modern if not<br />\nmore so. What is salvation? What<br />\ndo people want?

The Mozart Trio's interpretation gave little notice to<br />\nthe foreshadowing of the fiery<br />\nmature music of the master.

Wu<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nBand will play its sixty-third annual Spring Concert on Saturday,<br />\nMay 9, at 8 p.m. in Shriver<br />\nHall. The fifty-five member band<br />\nhas rehearsed since January for<br />\nthe event, and expects a crowd of<br />\nthree hundred, according to Band<br />\nPresident Howell Sasser.<br />\nStudents and the general public<br />\nare invited to attend free \"the<br />\nmost serious of all our events,\"<br />\nas Sasser describes it. The one<br />\nand a half hour performance of<br />\nmarching-style music will be<br />\nfollowed by a reception in the<br />\nClipper Room. Before taking this<br />\nmusical challenge, Sasser and<br />\nBand Vice-President Aaron Long<br />\nagreed to discuss some of the<br />\nlighter aspects of band<br />\nperformances.<br />\nOne of the highlights of band<br />\nshowings at the lacrosse games is<br />\nthe tinfoil barrage. Sasser explains, \"tinfoil is thrown at me.\"<br />\nThe Band President directs at<br />\n<br />\ngames, and \"two Presidents ago,<br />\nmy predecessor was, well, fat. So<br />\nhe made a big target, and some<br />\nmembers thought he was too<br />\nserious, so one of the ways they<br />\nloosened him up was by throwing tinfoil. It's a holdover from<br />\nthat. The band has refined the<br />\nprocess. Now they bring their<br />\nown rolls of tinfoil.\"<br />\nThen there is the game banana,<br />\n\"awarded\" to the player who<br />\nscores the decisive goal, in the<br />\nopinion of the band. Long says,<br />\n\"you pass a banana out to<br />\neveryone in the band, and then<br />\nafter the decisive goal, you all<br />\nshake the banana, you wave it<br />\nabout. And then you eat them.<br />\nI'm not sure of the origin or value<br />\nor this tradition, but I appreciate<br />\ngetting a banana at every game.\"<br />\nSasser has also been known to<br />\nstrip, or at least take off his shirt,<br />\nwhile the song \"Stripper\" is being performed. Long says, \"he<br />\ntook off his shirt once. Disappointed? Actually, I was<br />\nrelieved.\"<br />\n<br />\nSasser is also known as \"Daddy\" to all of the band members.<br />\nThis came about on the bus rides<br />\nto football games, when the<br />\n\"band members, being what they<br />\nare, decided to give me grief,\"<br />\nsays Sasser. \"The standard joke<br />\nwas 'Daddy, are we there yet?'<br />\nI chose to react to it somewhat<br />\nless than stoically, I've accepted<br />\nthe name now.\"<br />\nOlder than \"Daddy\" is the band's<br />\nrecording making machine. \"It's<br />\nblown a few tubes,\" says Sasser,<br />\n\"if we got some new tubes, we'd<br />\nbe recording again.\" But Long<br />\nadds, \u2014there happens to be a<br />\nmachine in the band capable of<br />\nmaking records. It's just a thing<br />\nwhich makes records. It's forty<br />\nyears old probably. We may have<br />\ncut a record in the past. We will<br />\nnever do it again.\"<br />\nSo until this machine is<br />\nrepaired, the band can, only be<br />\nheard in live performances, and<br />\nthe Spring Concert will be one of<br />\nthe few outings which does not<br />\ninclude tinfoil or bananas.<br />\n<br />\nUNLOAD YOUR STUFF WITH US!<br />\n<br />\nElI ALL-STOR<br />\nDOWNTOWN SELF STORAGE<br />\nO STUDENT DISCOUNTS<br />\n\u2022LOW MONTHLY RATES<br />\nO TRUCKS AVAILABLE FOR RENT<br />\nO STATE-OF-THE-ART SECURITY<br />\nO SIZES TO FIT EVERY NEED<br />\n<br />\n685-7170<br />\n<br />\n\f,<br />\n5d14W 11 116817<br />\n<br />\nArts Cal<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nin<br />\n<br />\nfish<br />\n<br />\nurinal.<br />\n<br />\nAreas<br />\nFinest<br />\nHaircutting<br />\nHAIR<br />\n<br />\nSTUDIO<br />\n<br />\n3333 N Charles St, Next to Wdmon iou<br />\n338-1126<br />\n10% Off With Student ID<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n'ROTUNDA'<br />\n<br />\nFILM<br />\n<br />\nMUSIC<br />\n<br />\nTHEATER<br />\n<br />\nAt UA Harbor Park you can<br />\ncatch the wild shenanigans of<br />\nNicholas Cage in Raising<br />\nArizona.

Already we've seen<br />\nthree Superman movies, one<br />\nabout Howard the Duck, and,<br />\nmost recently, a minor bidding<br />\nwar over the rights to DC Comics' Watchmen series. The<br />\npremise of the last is a \"realistic\"<br />\nrendition of costumed heroes in<br />\na pre-apocalyptic American<br />\nsociety. Movie makers are spending a lot of money to do the<br />\nthings comics publishers can do<br />\nfor much less.<br />\nComics hold a fascination for<br />\nHollywood right now for a very<br />\nsimple reason; special effects are<br />\ncoming close to the visual options<br />\navailable to comics. It's the<br />\nSpielberg \"Oh neat! Look what<br />\n<br />\nwe can do!\" syndrome. Pop<br />\nmovies are, to a degree, turning<br />\ninto comic books. Conversely,<br />\nmainstream comic books, with<br />\ntheir new emphasis on<br />\nsuperheroes who have \"real life\"<br />\nproblems(no joke, one of Marvel<br />\nComics' characters is dying of<br />\nAIDS), are turning into movies or<br />\nworse, soap operas. It's<br />\nfrustrating to see these mostlypale imitations, but occasionally<br />\nsomething comes along to point<br />\nthe way comic books can go, and<br />\nto justify whatever attention they<br />\nmay be receiving.<br />\nMore American Splendor, by<br />\nHarvey Pekar (Dolphin Books, a<br />\ndivision of Doubleday) is a surprising success. First, a few<br />\nreasons why it's surprising. The<br />\ncover of the book is a disaster.<br />\nThe designer just did not understand the selling points of this<br />\nbook. If ever a book was wronged by its cover, this is the book.<br />\nSecondly, the book consists<br />\nof<br />\nalmost - entirely<br />\nautobiographical sketches, and is<br />\nprominently subtitled \"The Life<br />\nand Times of Harvey Pekar.\"<br />\nDespite this, there is no \"the poor<br />\nsuffering artist disdainfully<br />\nobserved the fools around him\"<br />\nfoolishness to ruin the stories. Ignore the cover, and trust the<br />\nauthor's sense of perspective.<br />\nThe stories take care of<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nThe stories are about life in<br />\nCleveland. Don't let that bother<br />\n<br />\nyou either. The dialogue is<br />\nauthentic, the narrative consistently down-to-earth without<br />\nbeing affected, and the plotting<br />\nsubtly, meaningful, and realistic.<br />\nIn other words, the writing is<br />\ngreat. The only real disappoint-<br />\n<br />\nics are criticized on the merits of<br />\ntheir writing. Here, the writing is<br />\nliterate and skillful.

Traditionally, com-<br />\n<br />\nAmerican Splendor.<br />\n<br />\nthough, the book really shines,<br />\nparticularly in the story \"I'll Be<br />\nForty-three on Friday (How I'm<br />\nLiving Now).\" Art in a comic<br />\nbook should be more than a<br />\nsubstitute for descriptive writing,<br />\nor stop-motion photography.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the art and the writing in<br />\nthis book come together, the effect is astounding.<br />\nLong-time comics readers<br />\nknow the potential inherent in the<br />\nmedium, but it's good to see a<br />\nbook like More American Splendor that appeals to a more skeptical audience. No one wears a<br />\ncape. Tall buildings do not have<br />\ntheir dignity assaulted. And<br />\nabove all else, it is a thinking<br />\ncomic. Superheroes may always<br />\ndominate comics. Only in that<br />\nmedium do they seem to work,<br />\nand honest, there are intelligent<br />\nstories. (The<br />\nsuperhero<br />\naforementioned Watchmen, for<br />\nexample.)

They were coming off a<br />\ndisappointing 1986 campaign in<br />\nwhich the Blue Jays managed only four victories. Miracles could<br />\ncertainly not be expected from<br />\ntheir new coach, for while Coach<br />\nNelson is known for his success<br />\non the basketball court, he had<br />\nnever coached a tennis team<br />\nbefore coming to Baltimore.<br />\nThe Blue Jays, however, exploded to a quick 3-0 start with<br />\nshutout victories over Glassboro<br />\nState, Loyola, and Drew. The<br />\ncomeback was fueled by the addition of three key starters to the<br />\nlineup. Shaun Gelsinger returned<br />\nfrom a year overseas to regain his<br />\nposition as the top singles player<br />\nat Hopkins. Jason Shaplen also<br />\nreturned to the squad after taking<br />\na year off, and Ryu lwai transferred from SUNY just in time for<br />\nthe tennis season. Together with<br />\nDave Hannan, Jeff Shiffer, and<br />\nformer Delbarton standout Bob<br />\nFiocco, they formed the nucleus<br />\nof a team bound for great<br />\nimprovement.<br />\nThe fast start was brought to a<br />\nbrief halt, as Hopkins dropped<br />\ntheir next two matches to<br />\nGeorgetown and Widener.

Amidst a dinner<br />\nof taco salad and cups of soda,<br />\nthey gave us the following<br />\ninterview:<br />\nN-L:In terms of student involvement, community involvement, financial solvency, and<br />\noverall smoothness, how successful will this year's Fair be<br />\nrelative to past years' Fairs?<br /><br />\nThere are no junk vendors, just high quality<br />\ncrafts.<br />\n\u2014Mel Coursey<br />\nI think a lot of [faculty]<br />\ndo enjoy the Fair itself,<br />\nespecially when we talk<br />\nto other administrators and they say,<br />\n\"This year's Spring Fair<br />\nshould be really good.\"<br />\n\u2014Donald Chang<br />\nCoursey: Very successful in a<br />\nlot of ways. The Fair has done<br />\nvery well for itself financially,<br />\nmainly because of our arts and<br />\ncrafts, food, and program committees, which are our chief<br />\nmoneymakers. We've tried to put<br />\nall that money back into the Fair.<br />\nChang: As far as community<br />\ninvolvement, we have tried to<br />\npublicize the Fair through radio,<br />\nTV and the newspapers. The<br />\nMayor himself will open the Fair.<br /><br />\nThe Fair is supposed to break<br />\neven and we will be able to do<br />\nthat because all committees have<br />\nraised more than we anticipated.<br />\nWe are also getting elementary<br />\nstudents to participate in the<br />\nSafari contest and also in the<br />\nopening ceremony with 3,000<br />\nballoons.<br />\nN-L:Last year, the Fair was<br />\nheld the second weekend of<br />\nApril. Why is it being held the<br />\nfirst weekend of May this year?<br />\nChang: We don't have a lot of<br />\ndates to work with. We have to<br />\nwork within Homecoming, the<br />\nMCAT weekend, Passover and<br />\nEaster weekend. We found out<br />\nwe had only two weekends to<br />\nwork with, and that it was either<br />\ngoing to be April 11, 12 and 13,<br />\nor May 1, 2 and 3, and the Student Council chose the May 1, 2<br />\nand 3.<br />\nWhen we were selected to run<br />\nSpring Fair, we had a choice to<br />\nmove it back, but we decided it<br />\nwould be a much better date on<br />\nMay 1, 2 and 3, with a lot less<br />\npeople studying.<br />\nCoursey: The only real problem with the May 1 date us that<br />\nit conflicts with the Towsontowne<br />\nFestival, but we thought it would<br />\nbe much better for the students if<br />\nit were held May 1. It's right<br />\nbefore Reading Week and it gives<br />\nthem plenty of time before finals<br />\nto prepare. We're also hoping for<br />\nbetter weather.<br />\nN-L:Were there any major<br />\nunforseen problems or successes encountered in preparation for the Fair.<br />\nCoursey:There were no real<br />\nproblems I could think of offhand \u2014 nothing major.

How was the return of the<br /><br />\nconcert arranged?<br />\nCoursey: We tried getting the<br />\nconcert through a different route<br />\nthis year than they have in the<br />\npast couple of years. It's just too<br />\nbig a burden to put on ourselves \u2014 if the concert didn't go<br />\nwell, the whole Fair would<br />\ncollapse.<br />\nWe tried to get an outside promoter to run the concert, and he's<br />\none that's worked with student<br />\nactivities in the past. He did Pat<br /><br />\nMetheny in Shriver Hall, and the<br />\nRoches last year. We asked him<br />\nif he could arrange a deal for 500<br />\ntickets reserved solely for<br />\nstudents, at a five dollar discount.<br />\nIn return, we publicized it to<br />\nthe Hopkins community and tried<br />\nto sell those 500 tickets.

Vendors selling imported crafts will not be at the<br />\nFair, though over 100 other vendors will be participating.

The past couple of<br />\nyears that I've been at Hopkins,<br />\nit's been an energizing kind of<br />\nfeeling, because it heralds in the<br />\nnew season and also I think that<br />\nmost of the kids on campus are<br />\nlooking forward to summer, and<br />\nthat kind of excitement is contagious.

Having<br />\nknown Vandana for a while (we<br />\nwent to high school together, so<br />\nI really should have been on my<br />\nguard), being committed to committing academic suicide this<br />\nsemester, and just being a<br />\ngenerally warm, compassionate,<br />\nintelligent, generous(5' 10\", 160<br />\nlbs., brown hair/eyes, 19 years<br />\nold, 235-1303) person, I offered<br />\nto help out. \"Write anything you<br />\nwant, it doesn't matter,\" Vandana said, not realizing that she<br />\nwould later come to regret these<br />\nwords.<br />\nI first called Claire Battistella,<br />\nFair Games Co-Chair. Ms. Battistella reported that there would<br />\nbe about thirty teams participating<br />\nin the Games. She said that the<br />\nGames (which start at 1:00 on<br />\nGarland Field, Saturday and Sunday) would be in keeping with the<br />\nSafari theme, and that she thought<br />\nthe Costume Relay would be a<br />\ndefinite highlight. When I asked<br />\nfor a creative assessment of the<br /><br />\nSafari Games, Ms. Battistella<br />\nclaimed that as a Chemical<br />\nEngineer, she was not a good person to ask, and directed me to her<br />\nco-chair Julie Marrone (Political<br />\nEconomy). \"That's a more<br />\ncreative field,\" I was told. I had<br />\na feeling, after putting down the<br />\nphone, that Claire had just proven her creativity.<br />\nMs. Marrone has done the Fair<br />\nGames ever since they were<br />\nstarted, and still finds the antics<br />\nhilarious to watch. She promises<br />\nthat while Master of Ceremonies<br />\nSteve Schiller is a comedian in his<br />\nown right, the real comedians are<br />\nthe participants. During the<br />\nCostume Relay, competitors<br />\ndress up (and undress) as Safari<br />\nGuides. \"The clothes are really,<br />\nreally big.

We<br />\nweren't really part of the community, and didn't want to be. It<br />\npleases me that the student body<br />\nat Hopkins is very active in the<br />\ncommunity. And that works both<br />\nways, by the way. When you<br />\nhave news happening on your<br />\ncampus, whether its good news<br />\nlike the Fair, which we're very<br />\nheavily involved in, as you know,<br />\nor if its the Apartheid situation,<br />\nwe're there for each other, and I<br />\nthink that that's a very healthy<br />\nrelationship.

The stories that generated<br />\nheat six months ago have lost their pizzazz. And<br />\nthe comments we've made on these pages have,<br />\nfor the most part, been forgotten or ignored.<br />\nIn one last-ditch effort to rekindle some<br />\nsparks, we've collected some of our favorite<br />\nremarks over the course of the year.<br />\nAnd so, we give you, the final word. . . .<br />\nThe Shanty-Ban: In the end, if the new<br />\nshanty-ban is enforced, the Administration may<br />\nfind itself continuing what the firebombers<br />\nstarted\u2014using force and violence to silence the<br />\nopinions of others. (Sept. 12)<br />\nFirebombing: We commend the University<br />\nfor trying to discipline D.U. When the elected<br />\npresident of a fraternity publicly takes the lead<br />\nin planning a terrorist attack and nobody in the<br />\nhouse tries to stop him, the fraternity should<br />\nindeed be held partially accountable. It's absurd that Delta Upsilon International doesn't<br />\nagree. (Sept. 19)<br />\nAlcohol Policy: Every year at about this time,<br />\nthe Inter Fraternity Council has a meeting with<br />\nHomewood administrators. And every year, the<br />\nI.F.C. shudders from the Administration's fireand-brimstone prophesies about enforcement of<br />\nthe ever changing alcohol policy. This year has<br />\nbeen no exception.<br />\nThe new measures for the enforcement of the<br />\nUniversity's alcohol policy point to a problem<br />\nof growing concern. During the last three or<br />\nfour years since the state changed its drinking<br />\nage from 18 to 21, the University has taken<br />\nupon itself the obligation of actively enforcing<br />\nMaryland State drinking laws through every<br />\nmeans it has at its disposal. Fraternities have<br />\nbeen fined, placed on social probation, threatened with the loss of pledge classes, etc. . . . Now<br />\nthe University seems ready to recruit a network<br />\nof spies to infiltrate parties. The University has<br />\ngone too far. (Sept. 26)<br />\nShanty Arrests: This morning, an impending<br />\nsequel to Monday's ignoble events seems to<br />\nhave been averted. Reason has apparently<br />\ntriumphed over the brute force tactics used<br />\nearlier this week.<br />\nWe can only hope that the latest decision to<br />\npermit the construction of safe protest shanties<br />\nwill foreshadow a climate of cooperation between protestors and the University and prevent<br />\nunnecessary and mutually unproductive<br />\nhostilities in the future. (Oct. 3)<br />\nWJHU Power Boost: In the wake of the<br />\nUniversity's less than electrifying planning of<br />\nthe the station's power boost, perhaps a few<br />\nthings can be learned. First, in planning a project, particularly a technical one, discussion<br />\nwith technical advisors from the earliest<br />\nmoments of project planning needs to take<br />\nplace.[WJHU General Manager David] Creagh<br />\nhas continually maintained that developing a<br />\nstation like the new WJHU takes at least a year<br />\nand a half to two years to complete. His projection seems reasonable.<br />\nWhy then was the University community told<br />\ninitially that the entire process would take only three months? Either a lack of technical consultation or complete disregard for technical advice must have been at work. (Oct. 17)<br />\nDean Departure: As the top men in the<br /><br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences (the largest<br />\nacademic division at Homewood), Fisher and<br />\nCrenson have done an excellent job in directing and coordinating a vast array of academic<br />\ndepartments. Furthermore, both deans have<br />\nbeen remarkably accessible and eager to work<br />\nwith students.<br />\nIt's difficult to single out any specific achievement exclusively attributable to the work of the<br />\ndeparting deans. However, that probably is as<br />\nit should be. After all, the mark of many good<br />\nand efficient administrators is the lack of a<br />\ndistinctive mark. (Oct. 24)<br />\nM.S.E.: Already, some departments have indicated that their programs are suffering from<br />\na lack of literary resources. If those claims are<br />\ntrue, and they probably are, the University<br />\nshould be outraged.<br />\nNo top-rated prestigious research institution<br />\ncan function without a top-rated prestigious<br />\nlibrary. If Hopkins is indeed dedicated to the<br />\nacquisition and dissemination of knowledge, it<br />\nneeds to make a much stronger commitment to<br />\nthe improvement of the M.S.E. Library. (Oct.<br />\n24)<br />\nCarrier Station: Ever since the plans to hire<br />\na professional staff for WJHU were announced three years ago, proposals have been kicked around to establish a student-run alternative<br />\nstation to recapture the spirit of the \"Old<br />\nWJHU.\" Unfortunately, though, the glory days<br />\nare over, and such plans seem to be more the<br />\nwhimsy of a handful of die-hard WJHUers than<br />\na realistic strategy for the disbursement of the<br />\nSAC dollar . . . . (Nov. 21)<br />\nOrientation Report: Something sneaky is<br />\nafoot.<br />\nLast Friday at a 7:30 a.m. closed \"breakfast\"<br />\nmeeting, Dean of Students Chris Colombo<br />\npresented the Report of the Orientation Review<br />\nCommittee to the few Council members who<br />\nmanaged to attend. The report, which has been<br />\nin the works since December, not surprisingly<br />\nproposes recommendations which are unprecedented in the recent history of Homewood<br />\nstudent activities. . . .<br />\nThen as suddenly as the report appeared, it<br />\nfaded into the twilight zone of the Homewood<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nColombo told us early this week that the<br />\nreport had become an \"internal document.\"<br />\nHowever prudent the recommendations of the<br />\nreport may be (and we do not believe they are<br />\nprudent) one must wonder, why they were<br />\nscrapped almost overnight before the community had the opportunity to evaluate the work of<br />\nthe Orientation Review COmmittee. (Mar. 6)<br />\nTerwilliger: This week, the News-Letter<br />\nreceived a second letter from Joseph Terwilliger<br />\nin which he explains that his intention in writing<br />\nhis first letter of February 20 was not to discuss<br />\nthe Holocasut or John Demjanjuk, but to asses<br />\nthe vigor with which the University community would protect the right of someone to express \"neo-Nazi propaganda.\"<br />\nWe are outraged and ashamed.<br />\nTerwilliger abused this forum. While we are<br />\ncommitted to almost unrestrained expression of<br />\nconscientiously-held ideas on these pages, we<br />\nfeel no responsibility whatsoever to print lies.<br />\nThere is little we can do to retract the letter<br />\nthat was printed two weeks ago. But we do<br />\napologize to the community for being gullible<br />\nenough to trust Terwilliger. (Mar. 26)<br /><br />\nQuod est demonstratum.<br /><br />\nYet again our anti-Apartheid<br />\nshanty shares the fate of the<br />\nsquatter camp known as<br />\n\"Crossroads\" outside Capetown,<br />\nSouth Africa. Last time, for the<br />\numpteenth time, anonymous<br />\nstudents<br />\n(they're<br />\ncalled<br />\n\"vigilantes\" in S.A.) have taken<br />\nthe law into their own hands and<br />\ndestroyed our small form of<br />\nresistance to the Apartheid<br />\nsystem.<br />\nLike the Botha regime in the<br />\nrazing of Crossroads, the<br />\nHopkins Administration looks on<br />\nwithout critical comment.

They are<br />\nfully aware that they don't have<br />\na legal leg to stand on\u2014many<br />\npens have said that the injunction<br />\nwill be ruled invalid. How could<br />\nthe Coalition shanty cause \"irreparable harm,\" as the injunction alleges, and then be allowed<br />\non the lower quad all year?

Spring Fair is the largest<br />\nstudent-run event, but Orientation<br />\nand the MSE Symposium are of<br />\nequal importance, and the former<br />\nis being discussed to the detriment of students. The autonomy<br />\nand authority granted to<br />\nundergraduates are a privelege<br />\nand responsibility. This is usually overlooked. In order to<br />\npreserve the best student-run activities, students must not only get<br />\ninvolved, but they also ought to<br />\nthank those other students who<br />\nhave organized films, lectures,<br />\nparties and Spring Fairs for the<br />\nbenefit of all.

The events affected students, faculty members,<br />\nand administrators, and some of them changed, or will<br />\nchange, the nature of Hopkins.<br />\nTo present the issues in retrospect, we have written brief<br />\nsummaries describing the issue as it developed, and have<br />\nselected quotations that we believe accurately reflect the<br />\nnature and significance of the issues presented.<br />\nThe following is the list:<br /><br />\nStudent Activism<br />\nIt should come as no surprise that our top story for the<br />\n1986-87 academic year was<br />\nthe arrest and trial of three<br />\nHopkins protest shanty<br />\nfirebombers, the controversy<br />\nsurrounding the construction<br />\nof shanties in particular, and<br />\nthe issues of divestment and freedom of expression in<br />\ngeneral.<br />\nSo much happened with regard to the activities of the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa, the College<br />\nRepublicans, and miscellaneous splinter groups that it<br />\nwould be impossible to outline those events individually<br />\nhere. Instead, we have decided to group the firebombing<br />\nand the wave of issues it raised under the general rubric<br />\nof \"Student Activism.\"<br />\nThe comments of those who were directly involved in<br />\nthis year's student activist dramas probably speak more<br />\npoigantly than any description we could provide, so we<br />\npresent here our collection of the year's best quotations<br />\non the subject.<br /><br />\nal\"<br /><br />\nKevin W. Archer, the Hopkins graduate student who<br />\nwas burned during the May 24, 1986 firebomb attack on<br />\nan anti-Apartheid shanty, May 25, 1986: \"I'm just happy that we hadn't gotten in the [sleeping] bags.

The vigor of the reaction against the University's aberrant action is evidence that those commitments<br />\nremain firm throughout much of the University<br />\ncommunity.\"<br /><br />\nFlathman Report<br />\nThe second biggest story of<br />\n1986-87 is the publication of<br />\nthe Report of the Committee<br />\non Freedom of Expression,<br />\nalso known as the Flathman<br />\nReport.

Last week,<br />\nthe Student Council, after deciding that the Flathman<br />\nReport would not limit free expression on campus enough,<br />\ndrafted its own report on free expression.<br />\nThe Flathman Report: -\"In obtaining and requesting the<br />\nenforcement of an injunction against non-violent forms of<br />\npolitical expression, the University took an action that is<br />\nunprecedented in its specific character and a sharp departure from the traditional commitment of this University<br />\ncommunity to the protection and encouragement of the<br />\nwidest possible freedom of expression.\"<br />\nThe Flathman Report: \"So long as neither physical injury to persons nor significant damage to property is inflicted, freedom of expression must not only be protected,<br />\nit must be fostered.

It's<br />\na small number, relying more on<br />\nKathy's personality than her<br />\nvoice, but it comes off very well.<br />\nThe 1977 musical, The Fantasticks, yielded better songs than<br />\n\"I Can See It,\" but that was the<br />\nsong they chose. Michael Robinson has a sweet voice, and he<br />\nmostly drowned out Louis<br />\nKleiman, although the lighting<br />\nwas nifty. The 1978 Sondheim<br />\nmusical,<br />\nCompany,<br />\nwas<br />\nrepresented by \"You Could Drive<br />\nA _Person Crazy.\" Jill Austin,<br />\nBrigid Joyce and Julie Steigerwalt<br />\ndid a fair job doing-up the Andrews Sisters.<br />\nThe 1979 entry\u2014Anything<br />\nGoes\u2014was represented by the title song. A zippy little number,<br />\nit was sung with too little pep by<br />\nMarci Anderson. It was livened<br />\nup by some impressive tap dancing. The 1980 Music Man was<br />\ngiven a sour pick\u2014\"Till There<br />\nWas You\" is not one of this<br />\nmusical's better songs. The<br />\nmusical Pippin was represented<br />\nby \"Magic To Do.\"<br />\n\"Happily Ever After\", from<br />\nthe 1983 production of Once<br />\nUpon A Mattress, was fun. Kara<br />\nStein vamped it up as the princess<br />\nand gave the song inspiration.<br />\nHowever, at times the drummer<br />\ndrowned her out with his incongruous Keith Moon imitations. 1984's Hair was given two<br />\nsongs: \"Aquarius,\" sung by<br />\nLucinda Harper, and \"Hair,\"<br />\nsung by Greg Harmon. They<br />\ndidn't capture the spirit of the sixties, but it was a good try.<br />\nThe two songs culled from<br />\n1985's West Side Story were key<br />\nchoices: \"America\" was given a<br />\nclassy turn from Dede La Barre<br />\nand Emily Hamel. Hamel in particular was very good.. And<br />\n\"Tonight\" was given a decent<br />\njob, although the different groups<br />\nsinging didn't mesh all that well.<br />\nThree songs were performed<br />\nfrom last year's Godspell.<br />\nMichael Robinson sang a very<br /><br />\nsweet \"When Wilt Thou Save<br />\nThe People\" and Dale Bell joined him on \"We Beseech Thee.\"<br />\nThe highlight, though, was Alice<br />\nGriffin's rendition of \"Day by<br />\nDay.\" She set the tone, and when<br />\nthe cast joined in, it sounded just<br />\nright.<br />\nIntermission came, and a<br />\nchance to prepare the next batch<br />\nof costumes. The costumer,<br />\nIsabel Blevins, did a really terrific<br />\njob coming up with outfits for<br />\neveryone for every number. They<br />\nspruced up the dances, which, as<br />\nchoreographed by Ilona Kessell,<br />\nwere fairly entertaining but<br />\nnothing special. While synchronized well, the group dancing lacked spark. And there were<br />\na few people who seemed lost.<br />\nDuring intermission the audience had a chance to buy new<br />\nBarnstormer mugs, and to get set<br />\nfor Act Two's overview of<br />\nAmerican musicals. When the<br />\nlights went on, Peter Piccinini's<br />\ndisembodied voice promised to<br />\n\"journey with us, to a place in<br />\nevery town in America. . . to<br />\nBroadway.\" Besides the sudden<br />\nincrease in overbaked verbal flotsam, Act Two was even more exuberant than Act One.<br />\nA celebration of Broadway ensued, with \"Go Into Your<br />\nDance\" and \"42nd Street\"\u2014<br />\nsporting a Wayne-Newtonish<br />\nDale Bell. Then began the<br />\n\"Americana\" segment. Paying<br />\ntribute to dated musicals like<br />\nShowboat and Oklahoma is a nice<br />\nidea, but the song choice is<br />\nimportant.<br />\nSanjay Aggarwal came out to<br />\nperform what the Barnstormers<br />\nprobably expected to be a showstopping \"Old Man River.\" Aggarwal has a deep enough voice,<br />\nbut didn't have the range or emotion. It's a very intense song, and<br />\npeople make the mistake of<br />\nassuming only a bass or baritone<br />\ncan carry it off. If you have the<br />\nright feel, any bluesy voice can<br />\ncarry it off: the best version of<br />\n\"Old Man River\" you'll hear on<br />\na rock album was done by Rod<br />\nStewart on Jeff Beck's first<br />\nalbum. But Sanjay tried.<br />\nGreg Harmon performed \"Oh<br /><br />\nWhat a Beautiful Morning\" from<br />\nOklahoma as if he were singing<br />\nto his shoes. His voice kept losing it, and it was a disappointment, because Harmon can be so<br />\ndamn good. The next bright point<br />\noccurred two songs later, when<br />\nthe men, including Piccinini and<br />\nAndy<br />\ndirector<br />\ntechnical<br />\nAngelino, performed \"Next to<br />\nLovin'.\" It was very snappy, and<br />\nthe western clothes made you<br />\nforget that twenty minutes earlier<br />\neveryone was dressed in jazzy<br />\nblack-and-white outfits for the<br />\nBroadway numbers.<br />\nSkipping half a dozen songs<br />\nthat were listed in the program,<br />\nthe cast went to a few solos. Shari<br />\nRosen's \"Memories\"\u2014that one<br />\nmemorable song from Cats\u2014was<br />\na telling sign. She has a beautiful<br />\nvoice, but needed more practice<br />\nworking with the mike. Now,<br />\nwhy burden a performer with<br />\nelectronics, glitz and all those<br />\nthings that are superfluous to<br />\ntheater? Kathy Kennedy's \"What<br />\nI Did for Love\" was mike-less<br />\nand came off much better.<br />\nWhich is the problem with this<br />\nshow. Sure, director Linda Brody<br />\nis an old hand at this thing, with<br />\nlots of experience at Towsontowne Dinner Theatre. But producer Piccinini should leave this<br />\nglamour stuff to David Wolper.<br />\nWhen the cast settled for \"They<br />\nSly That Falling In Love Is<br />\nWonderful\" there was a moment<br />\nwhen angels might have flown in<br />\nfrom the wings. When the cast<br />\nwas all singing together on<br />\n\"Lullaby of Broadway\" it sounded great, but it was the small mowent that carried the show<br />\nthrough. When Lucy (Kathy Kennedy)explains to Linus what fire<br />\nhydrants are; when Michael<br />\nRobinson<br />\nstarts singing,<br />\n\"Tonight, tonight, won't be just<br />\nany night . . .\"A Celebration of<br />\nApplause is performed well, and<br />\nis a great way to spend two-anda-half hours immersed in extravagance.

According to the<br />\nFCC, \"patently offensive\"<br />\nmeans anything deemed \"offensive by contemporary community standards for the broadcast<br />\nmedium.\"<br />\nWhat it means to the rest of us<br />\nis that a station can be fined or<br />\nprosecuted for broadcasting a<br />\nprogram on AIDS.<br />\nIt means that a station is forbidden from playing a song with sexually explicit lyrics, a song that<br />\ncan be purchased at the record<br /><br />\nstore across the street for the<br />\nprice of a 45 or LP.<br />\nIt means that the FCC can use<br />\nthis vague guideline to censor virtually any broadcaster\u2014from<br />\nmaverick DJ's like New York's<br />\nHoward Stern to mainstream personalities like Oprah, Phil<br />\nDonahue, or Dr. Ruth.<br />\nWhose standards are being<br />\nmeasured here, anyway?

True to<br />\nthe play, the cast gave an inspired<br />\nperformance centering around<br />\nShaw's conflict between souls<br />\nand profit. The play is especially<br />\nrelevant in the high-stakes<br />\n1980's, and the question of<br />\nmorality is just as modern if not<br />\nmore so. What is salvation? What<br />\ndo people want? Do people want<br />\nsalvation?<br />\nThe play opens in the library of<br />\nLady Britomart Undershaft<br />\n(Delphi Lawrence). She confronts her son Stephen (Tony<br />\nSoper) with her problem: her husband, from whom she is<br />\nseparated, is their sole means of<br />\nsupport. And it looks like they'll<br />\nneed more since her daughters are<br />\nboth marrying men who are not<br />\nwealthy. \"It's not a matter of getting money from him,\" she says,<br />\n\"it's a matter of how much.\"<br />\nAnd for Stephen?

This 'new<br />\nsong' idea is what the Police try<br />\non their album, in the form of<br />\n\"Every Breath You Take\u2014`86.\"<br />\nThis song, however, is not worth<br />\nthe price of the album.

The Mozart Trio's interpretation gave little notice to<br />\nthe foreshadowing of the fiery<br />\nmature music of the master. The<br />\nensemble compressed the<br />\ndynamic range, limiting moments<br />\nwith a kind of glibness.

Wu<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nBand will play its sixty-third annual Spring Concert on Saturday,<br />\nMay 9, at 8 p.m. in Shriver<br />\nHall. The fifty-five member band<br />\nhas rehearsed since January for<br />\nthe event, and expects a crowd of<br />\nthree hundred, according to Band<br />\nPresident Howell Sasser.<br />\nStudents and the general public<br />\nare invited to attend free \"the<br />\nmost serious of all our events,\"<br />\nas Sasser describes it. The one<br />\nand a half hour performance of<br />\nmarching-style music will be<br />\nfollowed by a reception in the<br />\nClipper Room. Before taking this<br />\nmusical challenge, Sasser and<br />\nBand Vice-President Aaron Long<br />\nagreed to discuss some of the<br />\nlighter aspects of band<br />\nperformances.<br />\nOne of the highlights of band<br />\nshowings at the lacrosse games is<br />\nthe tinfoil barrage. Sasser explains, \"tinfoil is thrown at me.\"<br />\nThe Band President directs at<br /><br />\ngames, and \"two Presidents ago,<br />\nmy predecessor was, well, fat. So<br />\nhe made a big target, and some<br />\nmembers thought he was too<br />\nserious, so one of the ways they<br />\nloosened him up was by throwing tinfoil. It's a holdover from<br />\nthat. The band has refined the<br />\nprocess. Now they bring their<br />\nown rolls of tinfoil.\"<br />\nThen there is the game banana,<br />\n\"awarded\" to the player who<br />\nscores the decisive goal, in the<br />\nopinion of the band. Long says,<br />\n\"you pass a banana out to<br />\neveryone in the band, and then<br />\nafter the decisive goal, you all<br />\nshake the banana, you wave it<br />\nabout. And then you eat them.<br />\nI'm not sure of the origin or value<br />\nor this tradition, but I appreciate<br />\ngetting a banana at every game.\"<br />\nSasser has also been known to<br />\nstrip, or at least take off his shirt,<br />\nwhile the song \"Stripper\" is being performed. Long says, \"he<br />\ntook off his shirt once. Disappointed? Actually, I was<br />\nrelieved.\"<br /><br />\nSasser is also known as \"Daddy\" to all of the band members.<br />\nThis came about on the bus rides<br />\nto football games, when the<br />\n\"band members, being what they<br />\nare, decided to give me grief,\"<br />\nsays Sasser. \"The standard joke<br />\nwas 'Daddy, are we there yet?'<br />\nI chose to react to it somewhat<br />\nless than stoically, I've accepted<br />\nthe name now.\"<br />\nOlder than \"Daddy\" is the band's<br />\nrecording making machine. \"It's<br />\nblown a few tubes,\" says Sasser,<br />\n\"if we got some new tubes, we'd<br />\nbe recording again.\" But Long<br />\nadds, \u2014there happens to be a<br />\nmachine in the band capable of<br />\nmaking records. It's just a thing<br />\nwhich makes records. It's forty<br />\nyears old probably. We may have<br />\ncut a record in the past. We will<br />\nnever do it again.\"<br />\nSo until this machine is<br />\nrepaired, the band can, only be<br />\nheard in live performances, and<br />\nthe Spring Concert will be one of<br />\nthe few outings which does not<br />\ninclude tinfoil or bananas.<br /><br />\nUNLOAD YOUR STUFF WITH US!<br /><br />\nElI ALL-STOR<br />\nDOWNTOWN SELF STORAGE<br />\nO STUDENT DISCOUNTS<br />\n\u2022LOW MONTHLY RATES<br />\nO TRUCKS AVAILABLE FOR RENT<br />\nO STATE-OF-THE-ART SECURITY<br />\nO SIZES TO FIT EVERY NEED<br /><br />\n685-7170<br /><br />\n,<br />\n5d14W 11 116817<br /><br />\nArts Cal<br />\nA<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nin<br /><br />\nfish<br /><br />\nurinal.<br /><br />\nAreas<br />\nFinest<br />\nHaircutting<br />\nHAIR<br /><br />\nSTUDIO<br /><br />\n3333 N Charles St, Next to Wdmon iou<br />\n338-1126<br />\n10% Off With Student ID<br />\n-<br /><br />\n'ROTUNDA'<br /><br />\nFILM<br /><br />\nMUSIC<br /><br />\nTHEATER<br /><br />\nAt UA Harbor Park you can<br />\ncatch the wild shenanigans of<br />\nNicholas Cage in Raising<br />\nArizona.

Already we've seen<br />\nthree Superman movies, one<br />\nabout Howard the Duck, and,<br />\nmost recently, a minor bidding<br />\nwar over the rights to DC Comics' Watchmen series. The<br />\npremise of the last is a \"realistic\"<br />\nrendition of costumed heroes in<br />\na pre-apocalyptic American<br />\nsociety. Movie makers are spending a lot of money to do the<br />\nthings comics publishers can do<br />\nfor much less.<br />\nComics hold a fascination for<br />\nHollywood right now for a very<br />\nsimple reason; special effects are<br />\ncoming close to the visual options<br />\navailable to comics. It's the<br />\nSpielberg \"Oh neat! Look what<br /><br />\nwe can do!\" syndrome. Pop<br />\nmovies are, to a degree, turning<br />\ninto comic books. Conversely,<br />\nmainstream comic books, with<br />\ntheir new emphasis on<br />\nsuperheroes who have \"real life\"<br />\nproblems(no joke, one of Marvel<br />\nComics' characters is dying of<br />\nAIDS), are turning into movies or<br />\nworse, soap operas. It's<br />\nfrustrating to see these mostlypale imitations, but occasionally<br />\nsomething comes along to point<br />\nthe way comic books can go, and<br />\nto justify whatever attention they<br />\nmay be receiving.<br />\nMore American Splendor, by<br />\nHarvey Pekar (Dolphin Books, a<br />\ndivision of Doubleday) is a surprising success. First, a few<br />\nreasons why it's surprising. The<br />\ncover of the book is a disaster.<br />\nThe designer just did not understand the selling points of this<br />\nbook. If ever a book was wronged by its cover, this is the book.<br />\nSecondly, the book consists<br />\nof<br />\nalmost - entirely<br />\nautobiographical sketches, and is<br />\nprominently subtitled \"The Life<br />\nand Times of Harvey Pekar.\"<br />\nDespite this, there is no \"the poor<br />\nsuffering artist disdainfully<br />\nobserved the fools around him\"<br />\nfoolishness to ruin the stories. Ignore the cover, and trust the<br />\nauthor's sense of perspective.<br />\nThe stories take care of<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nThe stories are about life in<br />\nCleveland. Don't let that bother<br /><br />\nyou either. The dialogue is<br />\nauthentic, the narrative consistently down-to-earth without<br />\nbeing affected, and the plotting<br />\nsubtly, meaningful, and realistic.<br />\nIn other words, the writing is<br />\ngreat. The only real disappoint-<br /><br />\nics are criticized on the merits of<br />\ntheir writing. Here, the writing is<br />\nliterate and skillful.

Traditionally, com-<br /><br />\nAmerican Splendor.<br /><br />\nthough, the book really shines,<br />\nparticularly in the story \"I'll Be<br />\nForty-three on Friday (How I'm<br />\nLiving Now).\" Art in a comic<br />\nbook should be more than a<br />\nsubstitute for descriptive writing,<br />\nor stop-motion photography.<br /><br />\nWhen the art and the writing in<br />\nthis book come together, the effect is astounding.<br />\nLong-time comics readers<br />\nknow the potential inherent in the<br />\nmedium, but it's good to see a<br />\nbook like More American Splendor that appeals to a more skeptical audience. No one wears a<br />\ncape. Tall buildings do not have<br />\ntheir dignity assaulted. And<br />\nabove all else, it is a thinking<br />\ncomic. Superheroes may always<br />\ndominate comics. Only in that<br />\nmedium do they seem to work,<br />\nand honest, there are intelligent<br />\nstories. (The<br />\nsuperhero<br />\naforementioned Watchmen, for<br />\nexample.)

Becker, Sc.D., codirector of Hopkins' Preventive<br />\nCardiology Program, also found<br />\nattitudes of some nurses that may<br />\nindirectly encourage patients to<br />\nsmoke. The findings, she says<br />\nprobably apply to nurses in<br />\ngeneral and not just to those affiliated with a large urban hospital<br />\nsuch as Johns Hopkins.<br />\nMore than 25 percent of the<br />\nnurses who smoke, for example,<br />\nfelt patients should be permitted<br />\nto smoke in their rooms, even if<br />\nnonsmokers shared them.<br />\nAlmost half of the same sample said they should be allowed to<br />\nsmoke while on duty in the<br /><br />\nhospital and that encouraging patients to stop smoking was not a<br />\nnurse's role.<br />\n\"Nurses who smoke unequivocally influence patient<br />\nsmoking,\" Becker says. \"There<br />\nare a lot of small pieces of<br />\nevidence that show this.\" She<br />\ncites studies where presence of<br />\npeople pretending to be health<br />\nprofessionals smoking encouraged people in a hospital waiting<br />\nroom to do the same. A University of Minnesota survey shows<br />\npeople feel safer about smoking<br />\nwhen they see health professionals doing it.<br />\nBecker's stud), published in a<br />\nrecent issue of the American<br />\nJournal of Public Health, also<br />\nshows that nurses smoke in highly<br />\nvisible places such as conference<br />\nrooms, lounges and even, to a<br />\nlesser extent, at the nurses' stations, thus increasing their<br /><br />\ninfluence.<br />\nThe Hopkins study notes that<br />\n21.8 percent of all the nurses<br />\nsurveyed smoke, compared with<br />\ngeneral population figures of 30<br />\npercent. \"But\", Becker points<br />\nout, \"this is still high when compared with physicians and dentists.

They were coming off a<br />\ndisappointing 1986 campaign in<br />\nwhich the Blue Jays managed only four victories. Miracles could<br />\ncertainly not be expected from<br />\ntheir new coach, for while Coach<br />\nNelson is known for his success<br />\non the basketball court, he had<br />\nnever coached a tennis team<br />\nbefore coming to Baltimore.<br />\nThe Blue Jays, however, exploded to a quick 3-0 start with<br />\nshutout victories over Glassboro<br />\nState, Loyola, and Drew. The<br />\ncomeback was fueled by the addition of three key starters to the<br />\nlineup. Shaun Gelsinger returned<br />\nfrom a year overseas to regain his<br />\nposition as the top singles player<br />\nat Hopkins. Jason Shaplen also<br />\nreturned to the squad after taking<br />\na year off, and Ryu lwai transferred from SUNY just in time for<br />\nthe tennis season. Together with<br />\nDave Hannan, Jeff Shiffer, and<br />\nformer Delbarton standout Bob<br />\nFiocco, they formed the nucleus<br />\nof a team bound for great<br />\nimprovement.<br />\nThe fast start was brought to a<br />\nbrief halt, as Hopkins dropped<br />\ntheir next two matches to<br />\nGeorgetown and Widener. The<br />\nJays quickly rebounded,<br />\nhowever, to win four straight,<br />\nand their record now stands at<br />\n12-5.

Special Quizmaster thank you's go out to<br />\nmy favorite Quizlette (known affectionately as the Quizmistress), my favorite ratrunning typist for the timely advice and soda, and my favorite ratrunning photo gal<br />\nfor laying out Oprah, and my favorite copy editoresses.
