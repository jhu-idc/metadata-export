The assembly, sponsored by the Student<br />\nCouncil in conjunction with the two campus political organizations, marks the 1960 nationwide<br />\npresidential campaigns.<br />\nPat Connolly, in behalf of the Young Republicans, and Barry Miller, speaking for the<br />\nYoung Democrats, presented platforms on national security, human rights, education, economic<br />\ngrowth and the farm situation.<br />\nAfter the assembly, which was arranged mainly through the efforts of Bill Brandon, Dave<br />\nRicci and Bill DeVoe, ebospherated students expressed their political sentiments by casting ballots in ballot boxes located in the lobby of Shriven Alpha Phi Omega, the national service fraternity, counted the votes.<br />\nBelow are summaries of the platforms of the two political clubs as presented this morning.<br />\n<br />\nRepublicans<br />\n<br />\nDemocrats<br />\n<br />\nThe members of the Young<br />\nRepublicans Club of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, wish to reassert their faith in the philosophy of the Republican Party<br />\nand the principles which that<br />\nparty forwards.<br />\nThey believe that Republicanism is solidly grounded on traditional American political philosophy, the Republican Party<br />\nabhors centralization of power,<br />\nand has consistently made a studied effort to<br />\nbuild up the strength of state and local government; it firmly adheres to the balance of<br />\npower and checks and balances theory of American government.<br />\nIt views private enterprise as a force for the<br />\ngood and believes that regulation of such enterprise can only be condoned when the welfare<br />\nof the whole is threatened. It firmly holds that<br />\ninflation is detrimental to sound economic<br />\ngrowth, and that price, wage, and material controls are justified only in times of severe dislocation due to war emergency.<br />\nIt holds that labor and management are now<br />\non approximately equal bargaining terms, and<br />\nthat government interference only tends to postpone bona fide bargaining. The two Republican Administrations of President Eisenhower<br />\nhave seen no loss of territory or principle to<br />\nthe United States and the Free World, the unleashing of our economy from arbitrary governmental controls, the encouragement of free,<br />\nprivate enterprise which has raised America to<br />\nthe highest standards of prosperity.<br />\nThey hold that the present Republican Administration has proven itself more than capable of assuming leadership of a world threatened by totalitarian Communism; critics of the<br />\npresent administration have labeled it a \"do<br />\nnothing\" administration, but never before have<br />\npeoples in foreign lands given a head of state a<br />\nmore enthusiastic acclamation than that given<br />\nto Dwight D. Eisenhower as he rallied the<br />\nstrength of the Free World behind American<br />\nleadership.<br />\nThe Young Republicans firmly hold that<br />\nAmerica's leadership of the Free World can<br />\nonly be maintained by a reelection of a Republican Administration dedicated to protecting<br />\nhuman rights, dignity, and honor in a world<br />\nmade stronger by America's selfless leadership.<br />\n<br />\nThe Young Democrats' platform has been described as one<br />\nof \"constructive protest against<br />\nthe aimlessness and apathy of<br />\nthe Republicm Administration.\"<br />\nThe national security plant criticizes the Eisenhower administration for \"tuiduly compromis9 ing America's former unquestioned military superiority.\"<br />\nThe club advocates increased<br />\nmobility of the armed forces, an<br />\nincreased reserve and effective unification of<br />\nthe armed forces.<br />\nThe platform calls on the administration to<br />\nrecapture the diplomatic lead by proposing<br />\n\"bold and creative programs for the peaceful<br />\ninternational administration of outer space,\"<br />\nby increasing aid to underdeveloped countries<br />\nwith increased emphasis on the emerging African states.<br />\n<br />\nST,PAUL CLEANERS<br />\nTailoring - Repairing - Dyeing<br />\nSame Day Pressing<br />\ntomplete Laundry Service<br />\n32ND & ST.

They advocate the<br />\nestablishment of a Federal Fair Employment<br />\nPractices Commission, the enactment of a federal anti-lynching bill, federal aid to schools<br />\ninvolved in desegregation, holding back aid to<br />\ncolleges and universities which discriminate in<br />\nadmissions on the basis of race, creed or national origins.<br />\n<br />\nHaving previously reached an<br />\nagreement on the length of the<br />\nofficial rush season, planned to<br />\nbe two-and-one-half weeks long,<br />\nthe IFC delegates set upon the<br />\ntask of deciding just what wouLd<br />\ntake place during that period.<br />\n<br />\nThey call on President Eisenhower to endorse<br />\nthe Supreme Court decision of desegregating the<br />\npublic schools.

He further stipulated the<br />\nguarantee of human rights under<br />\nthe protection of the fourteenth<br />\nand fifteenth amendments.

A moderately large<br />\nassemblage heard Dr. N. Bryllion Fagin, associate professor of English and Drama at this<br />\nuniversity on the topic: Chekhov, the Dramatist, 1860-1960. Dr. Fagin is former director of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Playshop where in the past<br />\nhe has directed several of the plays of Anton<br />\nChekhov for presentation to the Hopkins community. Currently, Dr. Fagin is engaged in work<br />\non a book on Chekhov. His affinity for his subject and his devotion to it were plainly evident.<br />\nTalking about Chekhov is, for Dr. Fagin, a<br />\n\"labor of love\".<br />\nDr. Fagin chose to begin his remarks by discussing a movement in modern literary criticism, the so-called \"New Criticism\", in which<br />\nany consideration of the man is removed from<br />\nany consideration of his works. For a correct<br />\nview of Chekhov, Dr. Fagin feels that the man<br />\nand his works are inseparable. Chekhov was a<br />\ngreat human being as well as a good writer. His<br />\nwork reflects the writer and shows the kind of<br />\nperson he was. Chekhov \"loved\" his characters<br />\nand painted them with warmth and understanding. And the quality of the mind and genius of<br />\nChekhov, said Dr. Fagin, can be seen resident<br />\nwithin his works.<br />\nBy means of a brief biographical sketch of<br />\nChekhov Dr. Fagin attempted to show how<br />\nevents in Chekhov's own life and times, when<br />\ntransferred to bis plays, were accurately and<br />\nsympathetically portrayed. In his works, Chekhov could combine compassion as well as subjectivity. In formulating a new type of shortstory writing, which portrayed pathos which<br />\nwas not sentimental, the lecturer pointed to<br />\n<br />\nChekhov's influence in this respect upon such<br />\nwell-known literary figures as Katherine Masefield, D. H. Lawrence, and Franz Kafka.<br />\nIn the 1890's Chekhov's play The Sea-Gull<br />\nopened, only to be hooted-off the stage a failure.<br />\nBut in 1897 with the formation of the noncommercial Moscow Art Theatre by Stanislavsky and Danchenko, Chekhov had a proper<br />\nshowcase for his talents. This play literally<br />\n\"made\" the Moscow Art Theatre and ChekhoV<br />\nas a playwright. To this day, the emblem of the<br />\nMoscow Art Theatre is a sea-gull. (It is interesting to note a somewhat parallel situation<br />\nin the case of Eugene O'Neill, who found the<br />\n\"special showcase\" for the display of his talents<br />\nin the Provincetown Players, where many of<br />\nO'Neill's early plays were first produced.)<br />\nChekhov (like O'Neill) had no \"slickness\" of<br />\nstyle, and could not be termed a \"technician\".<br />\nHe wrote a new type of tragi-comedy. He foresook Aristotle's dictum that a play is action,<br />\nin favor of emphasizing the fact that, in life,<br />\nnothing happens. By means of his poetry and lyricism he could effectively dramatize this. He also<br />\nsaw the ridiculousness of futile hopes and built<br />\ncomedy around those observations. In viewing<br />\nChekhov, what is observed is a great spirit who<br />\ninfused his writing with his love of mankind.<br />\nFollowing Dr. Fagin's lecture, several members of the Johns Hopkins Playshop Association<br />\npresented readings from three Chekhov works;<br />\nThe Sea-Gull, The Evils of Tobacco, and Swan<br />\nSong. Featured were Richard Hart, Matina<br />\nPsoras, Paul Hinrichs, Walter Koehler, and<br />\nRoche Dorio. These scenes helped graphically<br />\nto illustrate many of the points made about<br />\nChekhov in Dr. Fagin's lecture and were very<br />\nastutely selected and directed by Hillary Hinrichs.<br />\n<br />\nP.B.<br />\n<br />\n-ealaedtiandence<br />\n<br />\nSection Hb of the Student Activities Commission<br />\nby-laws forbids anyone with less than a 2.3 average from Adamart Protest<br />\nrunning for a Board of Control position on any SAC To the Editors:<br />\nIn your previous issue, the<br />\nactivity.

The assembly, sponsored by the Student<br />\nCouncil in conjunction with the two campus political organizations, marks the 1960 nationwide<br />\npresidential campaigns.<br />\nPat Connolly, in behalf of the Young Republicans, and Barry Miller, speaking for the<br />\nYoung Democrats, presented platforms on national security, human rights, education, economic<br />\ngrowth and the farm situation.<br />\nAfter the assembly, which was arranged mainly through the efforts of Bill Brandon, Dave<br />\nRicci and Bill DeVoe, ebospherated students expressed their political sentiments by casting ballots in ballot boxes located in the lobby of Shriven Alpha Phi Omega, the national service fraternity, counted the votes.<br />\nBelow are summaries of the platforms of the two political clubs as presented this morning.<br /><br />\nRepublicans<br /><br />\nDemocrats<br /><br />\nThe members of the Young<br />\nRepublicans Club of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, wish to reassert their faith in the philosophy of the Republican Party<br />\nand the principles which that<br />\nparty forwards.<br />\nThey believe that Republicanism is solidly grounded on traditional American political philosophy, the Republican Party<br />\nabhors centralization of power,<br />\nand has consistently made a studied effort to<br />\nbuild up the strength of state and local government; it firmly adheres to the balance of<br />\npower and checks and balances theory of American government.<br />\nIt views private enterprise as a force for the<br />\ngood and believes that regulation of such enterprise can only be condoned when the welfare<br />\nof the whole is threatened. It firmly holds that<br />\ninflation is detrimental to sound economic<br />\ngrowth, and that price, wage, and material controls are justified only in times of severe dislocation due to war emergency.<br />\nIt holds that labor and management are now<br />\non approximately equal bargaining terms, and<br />\nthat government interference only tends to postpone bona fide bargaining. The two Republican Administrations of President Eisenhower<br />\nhave seen no loss of territory or principle to<br />\nthe United States and the Free World, the unleashing of our economy from arbitrary governmental controls, the encouragement of free,<br />\nprivate enterprise which has raised America to<br />\nthe highest standards of prosperity.<br />\nThey hold that the present Republican Administration has proven itself more than capable of assuming leadership of a world threatened by totalitarian Communism; critics of the<br />\npresent administration have labeled it a \"do<br />\nnothing\" administration, but never before have<br />\npeoples in foreign lands given a head of state a<br />\nmore enthusiastic acclamation than that given<br />\nto Dwight D. Eisenhower as he rallied the<br />\nstrength of the Free World behind American<br />\nleadership.<br />\nThe Young Republicans firmly hold that<br />\nAmerica's leadership of the Free World can<br />\nonly be maintained by a reelection of a Republican Administration dedicated to protecting<br />\nhuman rights, dignity, and honor in a world<br />\nmade stronger by America's selfless leadership.<br /><br />\nThe Young Democrats' platform has been described as one<br />\nof \"constructive protest against<br />\nthe aimlessness and apathy of<br />\nthe Republicm Administration.\"<br />\nThe national security plant criticizes the Eisenhower administration for \"tuiduly compromis9 ing America's former unquestioned military superiority.\"<br />\nThe club advocates increased<br />\nmobility of the armed forces, an<br />\nincreased reserve and effective unification of<br />\nthe armed forces.<br />\nThe platform calls on the administration to<br />\nrecapture the diplomatic lead by proposing<br />\n\"bold and creative programs for the peaceful<br />\ninternational administration of outer space,\"<br />\nby increasing aid to underdeveloped countries<br />\nwith increased emphasis on the emerging African states.<br /><br />\nST,PAUL CLEANERS<br />\nTailoring - Repairing - Dyeing<br />\nSame Day Pressing<br />\ntomplete Laundry Service<br />\n32ND &amp; ST.

They advocate the<br />\nestablishment of a Federal Fair Employment<br />\nPractices Commission, the enactment of a federal anti-lynching bill, federal aid to schools<br />\ninvolved in desegregation, holding back aid to<br />\ncolleges and universities which discriminate in<br />\nadmissions on the basis of race, creed or national origins.<br /><br />\nHaving previously reached an<br />\nagreement on the length of the<br />\nofficial rush season, planned to<br />\nbe two-and-one-half weeks long,<br />\nthe IFC delegates set upon the<br />\ntask of deciding just what wouLd<br />\ntake place during that period.<br /><br />\nThey call on President Eisenhower to endorse<br />\nthe Supreme Court decision of desegregating the<br />\npublic schools. The platform also calls for a<br />\nmassive program of federal aid to education and<br />\nthe repeal of the loyalty oath on National Defense Loans.<br />\nOther planks include a program to drastically reduce farm surpluses and extension of<br />\nsocial security benefits to mtdical insurance.<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page I)<br />\ndeclared this practice \"one of the<br />\nmost sinister and subversive elements ir. the administration and<br />\ngovernment today.\"<br />\nAlthough these were the main<br />\nthemes of his speech, the Senator from Oregon digressed occasionally to assure his audience<br />\nof the seriousness of his Presidential campaign; \"I don't know<br />\nhow I could be more serious<br />\nabout anything.

He further stipulated the<br />\nguarantee of human rights under<br />\nthe protection of the fourteenth<br />\nand fifteenth amendments.

A moderately large<br />\nassemblage heard Dr. N. Bryllion Fagin, associate professor of English and Drama at this<br />\nuniversity on the topic: Chekhov, the Dramatist, 1860-1960. Dr. Fagin is former director of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Playshop where in the past<br />\nhe has directed several of the plays of Anton<br />\nChekhov for presentation to the Hopkins community. Currently, Dr. Fagin is engaged in work<br />\non a book on Chekhov. His affinity for his subject and his devotion to it were plainly evident.<br />\nTalking about Chekhov is, for Dr. Fagin, a<br />\n\"labor of love\".<br />\nDr. Fagin chose to begin his remarks by discussing a movement in modern literary criticism, the so-called \"New Criticism\", in which<br />\nany consideration of the man is removed from<br />\nany consideration of his works. For a correct<br />\nview of Chekhov, Dr. Fagin feels that the man<br />\nand his works are inseparable. Chekhov was a<br />\ngreat human being as well as a good writer. His<br />\nwork reflects the writer and shows the kind of<br />\nperson he was. Chekhov \"loved\" his characters<br />\nand painted them with warmth and understanding. And the quality of the mind and genius of<br />\nChekhov, said Dr. Fagin, can be seen resident<br />\nwithin his works.<br />\nBy means of a brief biographical sketch of<br />\nChekhov Dr. Fagin attempted to show how<br />\nevents in Chekhov's own life and times, when<br />\ntransferred to bis plays, were accurately and<br />\nsympathetically portrayed. In his works, Chekhov could combine compassion as well as subjectivity. In formulating a new type of shortstory writing, which portrayed pathos which<br />\nwas not sentimental, the lecturer pointed to<br /><br />\nChekhov's influence in this respect upon such<br />\nwell-known literary figures as Katherine Masefield, D. H. Lawrence, and Franz Kafka.<br />\nIn the 1890's Chekhov's play The Sea-Gull<br />\nopened, only to be hooted-off the stage a failure.<br />\nBut in 1897 with the formation of the noncommercial Moscow Art Theatre by Stanislavsky and Danchenko, Chekhov had a proper<br />\nshowcase for his talents. This play literally<br />\n\"made\" the Moscow Art Theatre and ChekhoV<br />\nas a playwright. To this day, the emblem of the<br />\nMoscow Art Theatre is a sea-gull. (It is interesting to note a somewhat parallel situation<br />\nin the case of Eugene O'Neill, who found the<br />\n\"special showcase\" for the display of his talents<br />\nin the Provincetown Players, where many of<br />\nO'Neill's early plays were first produced.)<br />\nChekhov (like O'Neill) had no \"slickness\" of<br />\nstyle, and could not be termed a \"technician\".<br />\nHe wrote a new type of tragi-comedy. He foresook Aristotle's dictum that a play is action,<br />\nin favor of emphasizing the fact that, in life,<br />\nnothing happens. By means of his poetry and lyricism he could effectively dramatize this. He also<br />\nsaw the ridiculousness of futile hopes and built<br />\ncomedy around those observations. In viewing<br />\nChekhov, what is observed is a great spirit who<br />\ninfused his writing with his love of mankind.<br />\nFollowing Dr. Fagin's lecture, several members of the Johns Hopkins Playshop Association<br />\npresented readings from three Chekhov works;<br />\nThe Sea-Gull, The Evils of Tobacco, and Swan<br />\nSong. Featured were Richard Hart, Matina<br />\nPsoras, Paul Hinrichs, Walter Koehler, and<br />\nRoche Dorio. These scenes helped graphically<br />\nto illustrate many of the points made about<br />\nChekhov in Dr. Fagin's lecture and were very<br />\nastutely selected and directed by Hillary Hinrichs.<br /><br />\nP.B.<br /><br />\n-ealaedtiandence<br /><br />\nSection Hb of the Student Activities Commission<br />\nby-laws forbids anyone with less than a 2.3 average from Adamart Protest<br />\nrunning for a Board of Control position on any SAC To the Editors:<br />\nIn your previous issue, the<br />\nactivity.
