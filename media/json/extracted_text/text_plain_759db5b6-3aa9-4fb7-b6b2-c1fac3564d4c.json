Truth to<br />\ntell, they are not only afforded this opportunity; they<br />\nare required to take advantage of it, since the course<br />\nis necessary for graduation. So far, so good. A<br />\nknowledge of the workings of the business mechanism, no matter how sketchy it may be, is a decided<br />\nasset to any student, regardless of the particular field<br />\nof study in which he is engaged.<br />\nAll of the foregoing, however, is based on the<br />\nsupposition that the principles propounded to the<br />\nstudent are of sufficiently vital importance and embrace the many trends of economic thought which<br />\nprevail at the present time. But what do we find<br />\nat the Hopkins? Three professors hold forth on the<br />\nsubject, and it is a matter of record that two of them<br />\nhave as yet to enlighten their classes concerning the<br />\ndoctrine of Karl Marx and his followers. This, in<br />\nthe face of the fact that the Marxian interpretation<br />\nof economics is acknowledged to have exerted tremendous influence upon the history of Europe during<br />\nthe last century.<br />\nA discussion of public utilities, marginal value, and<br />\ntheories of rent, wages, etc., have their respective<br />\nvalue in an understanding and appreciation of the<br />\neconomic scheme as it is effected here in the United<br />\nStates. But we submit that such instruction be supplemented by a more universal study. This certainly<br />\nwould not be taking the study beyond the realm of<br />\nits elements. And in view of the fact that this one<br />\ncourse is all of the business schooling that the student<br />\nin the College receives, we believe it imperative that<br />\nit be made as extensive as possible.<br />\n<br />\nished by the Councils \u2014 unity between the underclasses and publicizing of activities\u2014that it is definitely a valuable project and that a certain measure<br />\nof vindication exists for the compulsory regulation.<br />\nBy ERIC GOLDMAN<br />\nAttendance at such assemblies as those addressed by<br />\nArthur Garfield Hays, Rev.

He said rather mournfully that<br />\nhe would play more if he had the time.<br />\nHe likes golf, too, and added that he didn't play<br />\noften because (more sadly still) he didn't have the<br />\ntime. During the summer he likes to travel, and<br />\nhere he added, again with a twinge, \"I'd like to do<br />\nmore of it if I had the time.\"<br />\nIt's easy to understand why Dr. Hubbard can not<br />\nfollow up the things he would like to do. I wasn't<br />\nin his office over five minutes, but during that time at<br />\nleast five people wandered in, looking for him.<br />\nIT WAS with the greatest difficulty that he Ns-as<br />\nfinally persuaded to even mention the title \\ of anything he had written. He simply won't talk about<br />\nhimself or what he has done. During the War, he<br />\nwrote the official history of the Signal Corps. \"I<br />\nhaven't much sympathy,\" he said, \"with the professional pacifists, but I deplore war.\"<br />\nHe is very interested in following campus affairs.<br />\nIncidentally, he spoke very nicely of this organ, saying that he thought it was the best college paper he<br />\nhad seen this year.<br />\nAs I should have mentioned before, Dr. Hubbard's official position is professor of physics and<br />\nchairman of the undergraduate work in physics. Although he would be the last one in the world to say<br />\nanything about his work in his field, just take a peek<br />\ninto Who's Who, and you'll find plenty.<br />\nHE IS completely absorbed in his work, and the<br />\nwork of his students. He said their problems were<br />\nalways a source of his greatest interest.<br />\nAfter the sixth person came in looking for Dr.<br />\nHubbard, I thought it about time to leave. And he<br />\nreturned to his quiet lab to help his students.<br />\nI never thought I'd live to see the day when a new<br />\n\"boardwalk\" would be installed between Gilman and<br />\nLevering. At least, I never thought it would come<br />\nthe same year that we were blessed with new roads,<br />\ntoo. I wonder if they found any money underneath<br />\nthe old one?<br />\n<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATES<br />\nThe Engineering School at the University of Delaware, according to The Review, undergraduate publication, recently announced the receipt of \"a valuableand instructive gift.\" The General Motors Corporation is building a 1934 Model Pontiac chaSsis for<br />\nthe school which will have sections cut from it to<br />\nshow in detail the operation of each part.

The money was<br />\nbeing spent and no noble edifices were<br />\narising to perpetuate their names, no libraries, no hospitals, not even a forlorn museum to proclaim their magnanimity. As usual, they explained their<br />\nsupport by a veritable catalogue of good<br />\nintentions, some of them very plausible<br />\nand all of a high and glittering nobility,<br />\nbut unfortunately not the motive which<br />\ninspired their contribution. They were<br />\ngiving neither to save Chicago from<br />\nthe gangsters nor to protect youth from<br />\nthe bootlegger. They wanted repeal because the enforcement of prohibition was<br />\nincompatible with an economic interest<br />\ncommon to them all.<br />\nBusiness men of every sort were solicited for funds and support in a letter<br />\nof which the following is Mr. Stayton's<br />\n(the chairman of the Board of Directors)<br />\nmemorandum:<br />\n\"Do you relize that Congress has<br />\nthe power to legalize at once a glass<br />\nof mild, wholesome beer? And that<br />\nworkingmen and others would willingly pay a tax of three cents per<br />\nglass and that that amount would<br />\nenable the federal government to get<br />\nrid of the burdensome corporation<br />\ntaxes and income taxes, . . . ?\"<br />\n0-0<br />\nTHE argument was hospitably received by the money men. But Mr.<br />\nStayton was not satisfied; he \u2022wanted<br />\nto make repeal a straight business proposition and exact from each man a sum<br />\nproportionate to his anticipated gain:<br />\n\"The Treasury Department figures<br />\nshow that there were nine individuals in Arizona who . . . had incomes of $90,000 and over . . .<br />\nBased on modification and the adoption of the proposed beer tax, each<br />\nof these nine . . . would be relieved<br />\nof more than $20,000 a year tax.<br />\nProvided these facts can be brought<br />\nto the attention of these nine taxpayers through the proper source<br />\nand in a serious manner, contributions of at least ten per cent of the<br />\nannual saving do not seem to me to<br />\nbe unreasonable.\"<br />\nOn these pious pleas the crusaders<br />\nfilled their war chest. And they were<br />\nconsciously and cunningly hypocritical.<br />\nMr. Stayton guarded the public reputation of the Association against any<br />\nimputation of self-interest. He instructed his assistants:<br />\n\"When writing to a man concerning the iniquities of the income tax<br />\nand the need of a beer tax, etc., . . .<br />\nwe should be sure to say, in substance, `it is not practicable in a<br />\nsingle letter to discuss all of the<br />\nevils that have come from national<br />\nprohibition . . . We are confining<br />\nthis letter to the financial cost of<br />\nthis evil measure.'\"<br />\nMr. Stayton's conception of a sincere<br />\nman is, in substance, one who murmurs<br />\nthe Golden Rule while stealing his neighbor's radishes.<br />\n0-0<br />\nMAGAZINES, of course, were not<br />\nneglected, the' North American Review,<br />\nApril, 1930, printed an article over the<br />\nsignature of ex-Senator Wadsworth, of<br />\nNew York, which happens to have been<br />\nwritten by Mr. Samuel Morse, \"of our<br />\norganization\".

He conferred with duPont<br />\nregarding<br />\nthe<br />\nSuperintendency<br />\nof<br />\nSchools in Wilmington, Del.:<br />\n\"It occurs to me that our association should endeavor to help select<br />\na new appointee . . . and thereby<br />\nprevent the teaching of dry propaganda in the schools .<br />\nThe point of this paper, however, is<br />\nnot that a group of men resorted to a<br />\ncynical circumvention of democratic institutions in order to repeal prohibition.<br />\nThat is sufficiently sordid, but not particularly unusual . . . What is of more<br />\nsocial significance in the instance of the<br />\nAssociation Against the Prohibition<br />\nAmendment is the brazen admission that<br />\nthe ultimate purpose of its persistent<br />\nlabors and vast expenditures was really<br />\nnot the immediate end which its io<br />\nenl<br />\ntrancing arguments led to, really<br />\nrepeal but the economic advantages<br />\nwhich these men expected to gain for<br />\nthemselves upon the success of their<br />\nagitation. If repeal is actually of general benefit, then its value is quite incidental; for the purpose of the Association was to repeal income, security, and<br />\ncorporation taxes and the way to do that<br />\nhappens to have been the repeal of<br />\nprohibition. In this instance, at least,<br />\nwe are getting legislation only as a byproduct of a definite group's interest and<br />\nit is scarcely a matter for less concern<br />\nif, this once and solely by coincidence,<br />\nthe by-product proves to be beneficial to<br />\nmore people than the members of the<br />\none class.<br />\nThe ugly situation is not without its<br />\nludicrous interludes. There are those<br />\nlolling in the easy chairs provided by<br />\nthe money aristocracy for whom that<br />\nposition is extraordinarily funny. Mr.<br />\nHenry Mencken, for example, is a man<br />\none would not casually classify as a<br />\nserf. He seems as free as the larruping<br />\nlingo in which he scatters forth his crashing dissonances of thought and phrase;<br />\nhis works are one terrific invocation at<br />\nthe altar of liberty; he has scarcely1 written a page without its eulogy of the unreformed man, or its disparagement of<br />\nthose who would assuage his pristine<br />\ncussedness. Yet /this notorious anarchist is not freer than any of the rest<br />\nof the meeker citizens to say what he<br />\npleases when his thoughts collide with the<br />\nvital tenets of the American class who<br />\nmanipulate every fofum of opinion and<br />\ndetermine whether new ones shall be<br />\nbuilt. He has his magazine, the American Mercury, \"committed to the return<br />\nof the American saloon\", as he proudly<br />\nannounces, simply because some wealthy<br />\ngentlemen, among them Alfred Knopf,<br />\nshare his dislike of prohibition and are<br />\nwilling to stake a publication in which<br />\nMencken's fervor and abilities may be<br />\nfully utilized in the cause. He is free<br />\nto say what he thinks because people of<br />\naffluence agree with him. His liberty<br />\nis one of rigorously enforced limits. He<br />\nis a prisoner who naively believes himself free because he doesn't want to go<br />\nbeyond the Prison walls anyhow.

Truth to<br />\ntell, they are not only afforded this opportunity; they<br />\nare required to take advantage of it, since the course<br />\nis necessary for graduation. So far, so good. A<br />\nknowledge of the workings of the business mechanism, no matter how sketchy it may be, is a decided<br />\nasset to any student, regardless of the particular field<br />\nof study in which he is engaged.<br />\nAll of the foregoing, however, is based on the<br />\nsupposition that the principles propounded to the<br />\nstudent are of sufficiently vital importance and embrace the many trends of economic thought which<br />\nprevail at the present time. But what do we find<br />\nat the Hopkins? Three professors hold forth on the<br />\nsubject, and it is a matter of record that two of them<br />\nhave as yet to enlighten their classes concerning the<br />\ndoctrine of Karl Marx and his followers. This, in<br />\nthe face of the fact that the Marxian interpretation<br />\nof economics is acknowledged to have exerted tremendous influence upon the history of Europe during<br />\nthe last century.<br />\nA discussion of public utilities, marginal value, and<br />\ntheories of rent, wages, etc., have their respective<br />\nvalue in an understanding and appreciation of the<br />\neconomic scheme as it is effected here in the United<br />\nStates. But we submit that such instruction be supplemented by a more universal study. This certainly<br />\nwould not be taking the study beyond the realm of<br />\nits elements. And in view of the fact that this one<br />\ncourse is all of the business schooling that the student<br />\nin the College receives, we believe it imperative that<br />\nit be made as extensive as possible.<br /><br />\nished by the Councils \u2014 unity between the underclasses and publicizing of activities\u2014that it is definitely a valuable project and that a certain measure<br />\nof vindication exists for the compulsory regulation.<br />\nBy ERIC GOLDMAN<br />\nAttendance at such assemblies as those addressed by<br />\nArthur Garfield Hays, Rev.

C.<br />\nHubbard. And so the long arduous journey from<br />\nGilman over the many and various ditches and<br />\ntrenches was well rewarded. The physics lab, in<br />\nwhich I first saw Dr. Hubbard, was a quiet place,<br />\nand seemed conducive to work, which is more than<br />\ncan be said about some of the madhouses that like<br />\nto call themselves labs.<br />\nThis quiet, subdued atmosphere is certainly exactly suited to Dr. Hubbard, for he is without a doubt<br />\nquietness, mildness and modesty personified. And it<br />\ncomes as sort of a shock to find that he hails from<br />\nColorado, which for some unknown reason I had always associated with blustery sort of people.<br />\nON THE other hand, it is not surprising to find<br />\nthat Dr. Hubbard's chief hobby is music . . . more<br />\nespecially the piano. He said rather mournfully that<br />\nhe would play more if he had the time.<br />\nHe likes golf, too, and added that he didn't play<br />\noften because (more sadly still) he didn't have the<br />\ntime. During the summer he likes to travel, and<br />\nhere he added, again with a twinge, \"I'd like to do<br />\nmore of it if I had the time.\"<br />\nIt's easy to understand why Dr. Hubbard can not<br />\nfollow up the things he would like to do. I wasn't<br />\nin his office over five minutes, but during that time at<br />\nleast five people wandered in, looking for him.<br />\nIT WAS with the greatest difficulty that he Ns-as<br />\nfinally persuaded to even mention the title \\ of anything he had written. He simply won't talk about<br />\nhimself or what he has done. During the War, he<br />\nwrote the official history of the Signal Corps. \"I<br />\nhaven't much sympathy,\" he said, \"with the professional pacifists, but I deplore war.\"<br />\nHe is very interested in following campus affairs.<br />\nIncidentally, he spoke very nicely of this organ, saying that he thought it was the best college paper he<br />\nhad seen this year.<br />\nAs I should have mentioned before, Dr. Hubbard's official position is professor of physics and<br />\nchairman of the undergraduate work in physics. Although he would be the last one in the world to say<br />\nanything about his work in his field, just take a peek<br />\ninto Who's Who, and you'll find plenty.<br />\nHE IS completely absorbed in his work, and the<br />\nwork of his students. He said their problems were<br />\nalways a source of his greatest interest.<br />\nAfter the sixth person came in looking for Dr.<br />\nHubbard, I thought it about time to leave. And he<br />\nreturned to his quiet lab to help his students.<br />\nI never thought I'd live to see the day when a new<br />\n\"boardwalk\" would be installed between Gilman and<br />\nLevering.

As usual, they explained their<br />\nsupport by a veritable catalogue of good<br />\nintentions, some of them very plausible<br />\nand all of a high and glittering nobility,<br />\nbut unfortunately not the motive which<br />\ninspired their contribution. They were<br />\ngiving neither to save Chicago from<br />\nthe gangsters nor to protect youth from<br />\nthe bootlegger. They wanted repeal because the enforcement of prohibition was<br />\nincompatible with an economic interest<br />\ncommon to them all.<br />\nBusiness men of every sort were solicited for funds and support in a letter<br />\nof which the following is Mr. Stayton's<br />\n(the chairman of the Board of Directors)<br />\nmemorandum:<br />\n\"Do you relize that Congress has<br />\nthe power to legalize at once a glass<br />\nof mild, wholesome beer?

But Mr.<br />\nStayton was not satisfied; he \u2022wanted<br />\nto make repeal a straight business proposition and exact from each man a sum<br />\nproportionate to his anticipated gain:<br />\n\"The Treasury Department figures<br />\nshow that there were nine individuals in Arizona who . . . had incomes of $90,000 and over . . .<br />\nBased on modification and the adoption of the proposed beer tax, each<br />\nof these nine . . . would be relieved<br />\nof more than $20,000 a year tax.<br />\nProvided these facts can be brought<br />\nto the attention of these nine taxpayers through the proper source<br />\nand in a serious manner, contributions of at least ten per cent of the<br />\nannual saving do not seem to me to<br />\nbe unreasonable.\"<br />\nOn these pious pleas the crusaders<br />\nfilled their war chest.

He conferred with duPont<br />\nregarding<br />\nthe<br />\nSuperintendency<br />\nof<br />\nSchools in Wilmington, Del.:<br />\n\"It occurs to me that our association should endeavor to help select<br />\na new appointee . . . and thereby<br />\nprevent the teaching of dry propaganda in the schools .<br />\nThe point of this paper, however, is<br />\nnot that a group of men resorted to a<br />\ncynical circumvention of democratic institutions in order to repeal prohibition.<br />\nThat is sufficiently sordid, but not particularly unusual . . . What is of more<br />\nsocial significance in the instance of the<br />\nAssociation Against the Prohibition<br />\nAmendment is the brazen admission that<br />\nthe ultimate purpose of its persistent<br />\nlabors and vast expenditures was really<br />\nnot the immediate end which its io<br />\nenl<br />\ntrancing arguments led to, really<br />\nrepeal but the economic advantages<br />\nwhich these men expected to gain for<br />\nthemselves upon the success of their<br />\nagitation. If repeal is actually of general benefit, then its value is quite incidental; for the purpose of the Association was to repeal income, security, and<br />\ncorporation taxes and the way to do that<br />\nhappens to have been the repeal of<br />\nprohibition. In this instance, at least,<br />\nwe are getting legislation only as a byproduct of a definite group's interest and<br />\nit is scarcely a matter for less concern<br />\nif, this once and solely by coincidence,<br />\nthe by-product proves to be beneficial to<br />\nmore people than the members of the<br />\none class.<br />\nThe ugly situation is not without its<br />\nludicrous interludes. There are those<br />\nlolling in the easy chairs provided by<br />\nthe money aristocracy for whom that<br />\nposition is extraordinarily funny. Mr.<br />\nHenry Mencken, for example, is a man<br />\none would not casually classify as a<br />\nserf. He seems as free as the larruping<br />\nlingo in which he scatters forth his crashing dissonances of thought and phrase;<br />\nhis works are one terrific invocation at<br />\nthe altar of liberty; he has scarcely1 written a page without its eulogy of the unreformed man, or its disparagement of<br />\nthose who would assuage his pristine<br />\ncussedness. Yet /this notorious anarchist is not freer than any of the rest<br />\nof the meeker citizens to say what he<br />\npleases when his thoughts collide with the<br />\nvital tenets of the American class who<br />\nmanipulate every fofum of opinion and<br />\ndetermine whether new ones shall be<br />\nbuilt. He has his magazine, the American Mercury, \"committed to the return<br />\nof the American saloon\", as he proudly<br />\nannounces, simply because some wealthy<br />\ngentlemen, among them Alfred Knopf,<br />\nshare his dislike of prohibition and are<br />\nwilling to stake a publication in which<br />\nMencken's fervor and abilities may be<br />\nfully utilized in the cause. He is free<br />\nto say what he thinks because people of<br />\naffluence agree with him. His liberty<br />\nis one of rigorously enforced limits. He<br />\nis a prisoner who naively believes himself free because he doesn't want to go<br />\nbeyond the Prison walls anyhow.
