The natural features of the region shotm<br />\non the map are those which are peculiar to the country that lies<br />\n<br />\nalong what is called the \u201cfall line\u201d\u2014the line or zone in which<br />\n<br />\nthe streams of the southern Atlantic slope fall in cataracts - .<br />\n<br />\nor rapids. from the Piedmont Plateau to the Coastal Plain.<br />\nWashington, Baltimore, and other cities farther north or south<br />\n<br />\nstand in this zone, which marks the head of navigation and .<br />\n<br />\nso determined their location. In the area northwest of this<br />\nzone the streams flow swiftly or turbulently in rather narrow<br />\nchannels; in the area southeast of it, at least in this region, they<br />\nbecome broad tidal estuaries. The Potomac makes its largest<br />\nleap at Grreat Falls, about 16 miles above Washington, and it<br />\nfoams in a smaller cascade at Little Falls, about 5 miles above<br />\nthe city. Those who may journey to Great Falls will find<br />\nthere, on the Virginia side, a half-ruined stretch of a part of<br />\na canal built under the direction of George Washington as a<br />\nlink in a projected chain of waterways designed to connect the<br />\n<br />\n\u201cEast and the West of his day. This canal was replaced by<br />\n<br />\nthe Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, on the Maryland side of the<br />\n<br />\nriver, which extends from Washingfon to Cumberland. The<br />\n- seene at the falls is impressively wild and rugged. Here the<br />\n<br />\nriver has long been wearing its way into hard rocks\u2014gnelss<br />\nand schist\u2014and in a deep gorge thus made below the falls its<br />\nwaters surge swiftly forward in their course to the sea.<br />\n<br />\nAt Washington the Potomac is joined by the Anacostia\u2014 -<br />\n<br />\nthe \u201cEastern Branch\u201d \u2014 on which, it is said, boats once<br />\nascended on tidewater to Bladensburg. In the Piedmont<br />\ncountry we can see how stream beds are cut; here, on the<br />\nCoastal Plain, \u2018'we can see how, by similar slow yet ceaseless<br />\n<br />\n-natural processes, stream beds are filled up; and we have<br />\nlearned, too, that the crust of the earth, seemlngly so stable, -<br />\n<br />\nis really always in' quivering motion and that regions are raised<br />\n<br />\nor lowered by subterranean forces which . from age to Hge -<br />\n<br />\ntransform land to sea and sea to land.<br />\n<br />\nIt is by just such erosion and deposition and by such ups<br />\nand downs that geologic formations are made: Areas that<br />\nare uplifted or that stand high are gradually worn down<br />\nby rain and rill and slide and stream, rocks are broken up<br />\nby frost and chemical action into fragments; and the waste<br />\nthus formed is carried down and deposited elegwhere at one<br />\n<br />\n\u2018or another period of time as gravel and sand and mud in<br />\n<br />\ngreat patches or in widely extended deposits to make forma-<br />\ntions. A formation is thus merely a deposit or a series of<br />\n<br />\ndeposits laid down, generally in water, at a certain time and<br />\n<br />\nplace; the stuff of which it is made is @s old as the earth.<br />\n\u2018The record of the time in which it was formed\u2014its geologic<br />\nage\u2014can be learned best from the remnants of once living<br />\nbeings that made it their graveyard for every age bas its<br />\ncharacteristic fossils. :<br />\n<br />\nThe rocks that lie northwest of the fall line are in general<br />\nold and hard\u2014rocks like granite\u2014and evidently once lay far<br />\nbeneath the surface; those that lie southeast of that line are in<br />\ngeneral younger and softer, including sand and clay. The<br />\ngource .of the softer deposits was, of course, the harder, older<br />\nrocks, and the way in which these rocks are broken down<br />\ninto fragments may be seen in any natural or artificial cut that<br />\nexposes them to weatherir g, such as a streamway or a road cut.<br />\n<br />\nWhere the granitic rocks are thus disintegrated the minerals of -<br />\n<br />\nwhich they are composed-\u2014quartz, mica, and feldspar, for ex-<br />\n<br />\nample\u2014become loose sand and clay and, being then subject to -<br />\n<br />\nmovement by running water, are gradually carried downstream<br />\ntoward the sea\u2014in this region southeastward. The oldest of<br />\n<br />\nthese southeasterly deposits were laid down in \"Cretaceous-<br />\n<br />\ntime, in what has been called the age of reptiles\u2014not snakes,<br />\nfor snakes were rare in that age\u2014but lizard-like and other<br />\nforms, some of them huge and unwieldy, much larger than<br />\n<br />\nalligators, others smaller, and still others having wings and -<br />\nBirds with teeth were among the strange<br />\n<br />\nthe power of flight. .<br />\nbeings of that age.

The natural features of the region shotm<br />\non the map are those which are peculiar to the country that lies<br /><br />\nalong what is called the \u201cfall line\u201d\u2014the line or zone in which<br /><br />\nthe streams of the southern Atlantic slope fall in cataracts - .<br /><br />\nor rapids. from the Piedmont Plateau to the Coastal Plain.<br />\nWashington, Baltimore, and other cities farther north or south<br /><br />\nstand in this zone, which marks the head of navigation and .<br /><br />\nso determined their location. In the area northwest of this<br />\nzone the streams flow swiftly or turbulently in rather narrow<br />\nchannels; in the area southeast of it, at least in this region, they<br />\nbecome broad tidal estuaries. The Potomac makes its largest<br />\nleap at Grreat Falls, about 16 miles above Washington, and it<br />\nfoams in a smaller cascade at Little Falls, about 5 miles above<br />\nthe city. Those who may journey to Great Falls will find<br />\nthere, on the Virginia side, a half-ruined stretch of a part of<br />\na canal built under the direction of George Washington as a<br />\nlink in a projected chain of waterways designed to connect the<br /><br />\n\u201cEast and the West of his day. This canal was replaced by<br /><br />\nthe Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, on the Maryland side of the<br /><br />\nriver, which extends from Washingfon to Cumberland. The<br />\n- seene at the falls is impressively wild and rugged. Here the<br /><br />\nriver has long been wearing its way into hard rocks\u2014gnelss<br />\nand schist\u2014and in a deep gorge thus made below the falls its<br />\nwaters surge swiftly forward in their course to the sea.<br /><br />\nAt Washington the Potomac is joined by the Anacostia\u2014 -<br /><br />\nthe \u201cEastern Branch\u201d \u2014 on which, it is said, boats once<br />\nascended on tidewater to Bladensburg. In the Piedmont<br />\ncountry we can see how stream beds are cut; here, on the<br />\nCoastal Plain, \u2018'we can see how, by similar slow yet ceaseless<br /><br />\n-natural processes, stream beds are filled up; and we have<br />\nlearned, too, that the crust of the earth, seemlngly so stable, -<br /><br />\nis really always in' quivering motion and that regions are raised<br /><br />\nor lowered by subterranean forces which . from age to Hge -<br /><br />\ntransform land to sea and sea to land.<br /><br />\nIt is by just such erosion and deposition and by such ups<br />\nand downs that geologic formations are made: Areas that<br />\nare uplifted or that stand high are gradually worn down<br />\nby rain and rill and slide and stream, rocks are broken up<br />\nby frost and chemical action into fragments; and the waste<br />\nthus formed is carried down and deposited elegwhere at one<br /><br />\n\u2018or another period of time as gravel and sand and mud in<br /><br />\ngreat patches or in widely extended deposits to make forma-<br />\ntions. A formation is thus merely a deposit or a series of<br /><br />\ndeposits laid down, generally in water, at a certain time and<br /><br />\nplace; the stuff of which it is made is @s old as the earth.<br />\n\u2018The record of the time in which it was formed\u2014its geologic<br />\nage\u2014can be learned best from the remnants of once living<br />\nbeings that made it their graveyard for every age bas its<br />\ncharacteristic fossils. :<br /><br />\nThe rocks that lie northwest of the fall line are in general<br />\nold and hard\u2014rocks like granite\u2014and evidently once lay far<br />\nbeneath the surface; those that lie southeast of that line are in<br />\ngeneral younger and softer, including sand and clay. The<br />\ngource .of the softer deposits was, of course, the harder, older<br />\nrocks, and the way in which these rocks are broken down<br />\ninto fragments may be seen in any natural or artificial cut that<br />\nexposes them to weatherir g, such as a streamway or a road cut.<br /><br />\nWhere the granitic rocks are thus disintegrated the minerals of -<br /><br />\nwhich they are composed-\u2014quartz, mica, and feldspar, for ex-<br /><br />\nample\u2014become loose sand and clay and, being then subject to -<br /><br />\nmovement by running water, are gradually carried downstream<br />\ntoward the sea\u2014in this region southeastward.
