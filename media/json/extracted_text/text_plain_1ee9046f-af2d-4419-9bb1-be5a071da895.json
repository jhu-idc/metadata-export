Telephone BE 5-5879.<br />\n<br />\nEscape From Freedom<br />\n\"Life at a university is an endless exercise in freedom.\" This is Hopkins' most generous self-plaudit. This<br />\nis the theory, but not the practice. It is a theory which<br />\nbreeds permissiveness\u2014an attitudp which assumes that<br />\ntile entering student is mature enough to be governed by<br />\nan ideal \"Gentleman's Code,\" that all phases of life should<br />\nbe on, a live and let live basis, that the proctor merely<br />\nprovides a hateful symbol to be evaded, and that the giving<br />\nof responsibility is of benefit in the maturation process.<br />\nThe maturation process is disturbing and is the basis<br />\nfor a rejection of the theory. The transition from high<br />\nschool .to college is difficult, but given Hopkins' permissiveness, it is more difficult. Any reaction to this situation<br />\nnecessarily varies with the individual, but there are three<br />\ngeneral reactions.<br />\nMost students make a good adjustment, and temper<br />\npermissiveness with an awareness that they must fulfill<br />\ncertain obligations. Others abuse their freedom, refuse<br />\nto recognize their freedom and suffer academic harm.<br />\nStill others initially reject the freedom and seek authority<br />\nto guide them, while some escape the early consequences<br />\nof an improper reaction to permissiveness and eventually<br />\nconclude, like those who initially reject freedom, that it<br />\nwas not beneficial for them and is prone -to limitation.<br />\nThose who abuse freedom reject it because it harms<br />\nthem. Those who reject it initially do so because they<br />\nrefuse to exercise it in a situation which permits and<br />\nencourages its use and which is founded on the assumption that the reasonable man will not turn freedom into<br />\nlicense. In all cases, they seek to escape freedom.<br />\nIn escaping, they indicate that, given less than optimum maturity, they become dependent on multifarious<br />\ncrutches which allow them to evade the vissicitudes of<br />\nfreedom and the concommitant self-reliance which forces<br />\nthem to become adults. They indicate their immaturity<br />\nand unwillingness to develop independently.<br />\nThese crutches are, moreover, insidious to others because they have the indirect effect of jeopardizing the<br />\npermissive system which some find compatible with their<br />\ndesires for self-fulfillment. Further, when self-reliance<br />\nis surrendered by a few, it may well be given over by<br />\nmany who see an example of the easier life through props.<br />\nThe paradox is clear\u2014those who reject freedom do<br />\nnot, however, want total authority, but merely benevolent<br />\ncrutches. And yet in surrendering some of their freedom, they tend to surrender most; worse yet, they fail<br />\nto recognize the ultimate value of freedom to themselves<br />\nand the danger they do to the freedom of those who do<br />\nnot want crutches or overbearing authority.<br />\n<br />\nLike Nowhere, Man!<br />\nAttacked, chided and analyzed, a generation stands<br />\nseemingly friendless. Today's college generation has been<br />\nvariously characterized as \"beat,\" \"silent\" or \"without a<br />\ncause.\"<br />\nLying directly within the range of fire of seedy and<br />\nmusty dons, criptie and notetaking analysts, socilogically<br />\nminded educators, religiously oriented activity creators<br />\nand all those who mind other people's business because<br />\ntheir own is too menial and worthless, the generation is<br />\nbeat(en), and \"woe\" cry its delighted detractors.<br />\nWe asked a few articulate undergraduates in all areas<br />\nof study, of all ages and-of all backgrounds to give the one<br />\nword which best characterizes the most prominent trait<br />\nof their generation. From the collection of words, we<br />\nhave found a pattern.<br />\nOur contemporaries think themselves to be spineless<br />\nand gutless\u2014without strength or courage. They are, they<br />\nsay; \"cautious,\" \"afraid,\" \"apathetic,\" \"group-minded,\"<br />\n\"lacking courage,\" \"security seeking,\" 4'complacent,\"<br />\n\"overaided and underworked,\" \"lazy,\" \"disinterested,\" \"bewildered,\" \"frustrated,\" \"undirected,\" \"seeking\" and<br />\n\"waiting.\" Above all, they are \"conformist.\"<br />\nWe presume our generation's justified critics would<br />\nhave us change. Yet such change\u2014when seen as the action of the student leader who dares advocate his opinions<br />\nwhen they are not expedient or popular; of the undergraduate who calls the shots as he sees them; of the<br />\nstudent who avoids the crutches offered and seeks his own<br />\nstandards; of the imaginative who condones what convention may term \"bad\"\u2014is hardly given a better reception. We are faced with the dismaying paradox of criticism for not only silence and conformity but also for initiative and non-conformity.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 6, 1959<br />\n<br />\nHooded Figures Attach List<br />\nTo Gilman Hall Main Door<br />\nLast night, by the light of a<br />\nburning St. Andrew's cross,<br />\nhooded figures tacked a list. of.<br />\ncomplaints to the main door of<br />\nGilman Hall.<br />\n<br />\n.............<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSecond, assuming the Pro'<br />\npriety of devoting the amount<br />\ninvolved to the dormitories It<br />\nwould be preferable to emploY<br />\nit in one of the many possible<br />\nways which would promote better living on campus.

Telephone BE 5-5879.<br /><br />\nEscape From Freedom<br />\n\"Life at a university is an endless exercise in freedom.\" This is Hopkins' most generous self-plaudit. This<br />\nis the theory, but not the practice. It is a theory which<br />\nbreeds permissiveness\u2014an attitudp which assumes that<br />\ntile entering student is mature enough to be governed by<br />\nan ideal \"Gentleman's Code,\" that all phases of life should<br />\nbe on, a live and let live basis, that the proctor merely<br />\nprovides a hateful symbol to be evaded, and that the giving<br />\nof responsibility is of benefit in the maturation process.<br />\nThe maturation process is disturbing and is the basis<br />\nfor a rejection of the theory. The transition from high<br />\nschool .to college is difficult, but given Hopkins' permissiveness, it is more difficult. Any reaction to this situation<br />\nnecessarily varies with the individual, but there are three<br />\ngeneral reactions.<br />\nMost students make a good adjustment, and temper<br />\npermissiveness with an awareness that they must fulfill<br />\ncertain obligations. Others abuse their freedom, refuse<br />\nto recognize their freedom and suffer academic harm.<br />\nStill others initially reject the freedom and seek authority<br />\nto guide them, while some escape the early consequences<br />\nof an improper reaction to permissiveness and eventually<br />\nconclude, like those who initially reject freedom, that it<br />\nwas not beneficial for them and is prone -to limitation.<br />\nThose who abuse freedom reject it because it harms<br />\nthem. Those who reject it initially do so because they<br />\nrefuse to exercise it in a situation which permits and<br />\nencourages its use and which is founded on the assumption that the reasonable man will not turn freedom into<br />\nlicense. In all cases, they seek to escape freedom.<br />\nIn escaping, they indicate that, given less than optimum maturity, they become dependent on multifarious<br />\ncrutches which allow them to evade the vissicitudes of<br />\nfreedom and the concommitant self-reliance which forces<br />\nthem to become adults. They indicate their immaturity<br />\nand unwillingness to develop independently.<br />\nThese crutches are, moreover, insidious to others because they have the indirect effect of jeopardizing the<br />\npermissive system which some find compatible with their<br />\ndesires for self-fulfillment. Further, when self-reliance<br />\nis surrendered by a few, it may well be given over by<br />\nmany who see an example of the easier life through props.<br />\nThe paradox is clear\u2014those who reject freedom do<br />\nnot, however, want total authority, but merely benevolent<br />\ncrutches. And yet in surrendering some of their freedom, they tend to surrender most; worse yet, they fail<br />\nto recognize the ultimate value of freedom to themselves<br />\nand the danger they do to the freedom of those who do<br />\nnot want crutches or overbearing authority.<br /><br />\nLike Nowhere, Man!<br />\nAttacked, chided and analyzed, a generation stands<br />\nseemingly friendless. Today's college generation has been<br />\nvariously characterized as \"beat,\" \"silent\" or \"without a<br />\ncause.\"<br />\nLying directly within the range of fire of seedy and<br />\nmusty dons, criptie and notetaking analysts, socilogically<br />\nminded educators, religiously oriented activity creators<br />\nand all those who mind other people's business because<br />\ntheir own is too menial and worthless, the generation is<br />\nbeat(en), and \"woe\" cry its delighted detractors.<br />\nWe asked a few articulate undergraduates in all areas<br />\nof study, of all ages and-of all backgrounds to give the one<br />\nword which best characterizes the most prominent trait<br />\nof their generation. From the collection of words, we<br />\nhave found a pattern.<br />\nOur contemporaries think themselves to be spineless<br />\nand gutless\u2014without strength or courage. They are, they<br />\nsay; \"cautious,\" \"afraid,\" \"apathetic,\" \"group-minded,\"<br />\n\"lacking courage,\" \"security seeking,\" 4'complacent,\"<br />\n\"overaided and underworked,\" \"lazy,\" \"disinterested,\" \"bewildered,\" \"frustrated,\" \"undirected,\" \"seeking\" and<br />\n\"waiting.\" Above all, they are \"conformist.\"<br />\nWe presume our generation's justified critics would<br />\nhave us change. Yet such change\u2014when seen as the action of the student leader who dares advocate his opinions<br />\nwhen they are not expedient or popular; of the undergraduate who calls the shots as he sees them; of the<br />\nstudent who avoids the crutches offered and seeks his own<br />\nstandards; of the imaginative who condones what convention may term \"bad\"\u2014is hardly given a better reception. We are faced with the dismaying paradox of criticism for not only silence and conformity but also for initiative and non-conformity.<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 6, 1959<br /><br />\nHooded Figures Attach List<br />\nTo Gilman Hall Main Door<br />\nLast night, by the light of a<br />\nburning St. Andrew's cross,<br />\nhooded figures tacked a list. of.<br />\ncomplaints to the main door of<br />\nGilman Hall.<br /><br />\n.............<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nSecond, assuming the Pro'<br />\npriety of devoting the amount<br />\ninvolved to the dormitories It<br />\nwould be preferable to emploY<br />\nit in one of the many possible<br />\nways which would promote better living on campus.
