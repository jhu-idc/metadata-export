In the first place, the actual length of the season during<br />\nwhich the men participate in the work is entirely different; members of an athletic team practice for three months, at the most;<br />\nmembers of a publication staff give up from two to four afternoons a week throughout the year. A second difference\u2014one<br />\nwhich, although it sounds extremely childish,is actually based upon<br />\nadult human nature\u2014is that members of athletic teams receive a<br />\nvery considerable reward in the form of \"glory\" and \"publicity.\"<br />\nSuperficial as such rewards may appear to be, they have proved<br />\nto be great incentives to hard work during an athletic \"season.\"<br />\nNow members of publications bask in none of this sunshine; they<br />\ncannot look forward to the day when the season is over and they<br />\ncan break training and take it easy. Their work goes on steadily<br />\nfor eight months. Moreover, the small number of available men<br />\ndoes not permit staff members to take holidays every other week,<br />\nfor \"copy\" must be written.<br />\nIt is only natural, therefore, when a man has worked on a publication for two or three years, and has not attained a position on the<br />\nboard which carries with it a vast amount of prestige, his natural<br />\ninclination is to quit. And quit he usually does, doing great harm<br />\nto the publication. We realize full well that ideally it is fine to<br />\nhave men work every week for three or four years for pure fun<br />\nand through pure \"spirit,\" but, after all, human nature is unfortunately human nature. Giving these men an additional incentive<br />\nwill result in a great improvement in the quality and quantity of<br />\nwork that they will do for the publication.<br />\nThere are cases which we can quote of men who have been<br />\nforced to resign position on the NEWS-LETTER because they needed<br />\nthe time for some outside work which would be remunerative. Is<br />\nit not far better to have such men carry on? It is a well-known<br />\nfact that if an athlete is in need of funds he can nearly always find<br />\nsinecures to supply them. In the case of publications, which can<br />\nbe, comparatively, as profitable undertakings as larger newspapers,<br />\nwe see no reason why the men who give up much valuable time<br />\nshould not be allowed to realize on their efforts.<br />\nThe plan is not original at Hopkins. Princeton, for example,<br />\nhas been remurerating members of publications for over eighteen<br />\nyears. The members of all college dailies and a majority of semiweeklies, as well as most comics, have employed similar plans for<br />\na number of years. The idea has received the approval here of<br />\nsuch men as Dean Ames, Dr. Wight, Mr. S. Page Nelson, and the<br />\nentire faculty committee on student affairs.<br />\nWe hope that the feeling expressed in the letter in the \"Mailbag\"<br />\ndoes not represent widespread opinion, for we feel that, under the<br />\nconditions mentioned, there is nothing unfair or unduly \"professionalistic\" in the plan. It is merely a means to accomplish two<br />\nends; first, to improve the quality of the publications by affording<br />\nkeener competition, and second, to afford an additional reward for<br />\nthose men to whom great quantities of glory does not accrue.<br />\n<br />\nCORRIDOR<br />\nThis room will be quite peaceful, if I close the door.<br />\nThe music tires me; we will dance some more<br />\nWhen I have rested; there :\u2014we'll only stay<br />\nA moment, since the music is so gay.<br />\nThe sound snaps off like an electric light;<br />\nComes tolerance, inertia close to wisdom, peace;<br />\nSoon we'll return, and dance away the night<br />\nTo that young tragic tune; I like this short release<br />\nFrom hectic, maddened, happy, noisy youth . .<br />\nThis lack of feeling . . . it may be, in truth,<br />\nA subtle fusion of the music's shrill appeal . .<br />\nI guess that wisdom is to never feel . . .<br />\nPhilosophy . . .

Dr. Motley emphasized the value of such a<br />\nbuilding in providing for the students' social life, and of the desirability of perpetuating it. He pointed<br />\nout that the gifts of Mr. Levering,<br />\nsubstantial as they are, will not be<br />\nadequate for providing a student<br />\nbuilding for the enlarged University.<br />\nProf. Arthur Holmes, professor<br />\nof the Psychology of Religion at<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania,<br />\nspoke on the place of religion in<br />\nthe student's life.

No doubt he<br />\nwas congratulated by many!<br />\nThe most astounding fact, however, was that the initiate did not<br />\neven know what the pin meant! To<br />\nblame this on the colored brother's<br />\nstupidity is useless, for we have<br />\nonly to remember the days of the<br />\n\"sweatbox.\" As yet the question<br />\n<br />\nhas not come before the Interfratemity Board, but certainly that<br />\ngroup will at least bar the new fraternity man from representative<br />\nmembership on the Board.<br />\nBut to continue the story, in fairness to the fraternity involved.

I was near\u2014oblivion...<br />\nWith a shock I fell\u2014fell into the clear black pit of sleep; and,<br />\nturning sharply on my pillow, I was wide awake again.<br />\nThere was no sleep for me.<br /><br />\nREMUNERATION FOR PUBLICATION MEMBERS<br />\nA letter to the editor of the NEWS-LETTER published in this issue<br />\nobjects to the recently announced plan for remunerating members<br />\nof staffs of undergraduate publications on the grounds, chiefly,<br />\nthat the move inevitably will bring about distasteful \"professionalism.\" He draws an analogy between athletic teams and publications, pointing out that if members of a football team were to<br />\n- receive cash for their efforts, there would be no end to the criticism that would follow.<br />\nBefore advancing any other arguments, we wish to call attention to the fact that, whereas this analogy seems, superficially, to<br />\nbe well drawn, closer inspection shows that it is really not so<br />\nstrong. In the first place, the actual length of the season during<br />\nwhich the men participate in the work is entirely different; members of an athletic team practice for three months, at the most;<br />\nmembers of a publication staff give up from two to four afternoons a week throughout the year. A second difference\u2014one<br />\nwhich, although it sounds extremely childish,is actually based upon<br />\nadult human nature\u2014is that members of athletic teams receive a<br />\nvery considerable reward in the form of \"glory\" and \"publicity.\"<br />\nSuperficial as such rewards may appear to be, they have proved<br />\nto be great incentives to hard work during an athletic \"season.\"<br />\nNow members of publications bask in none of this sunshine; they<br />\ncannot look forward to the day when the season is over and they<br />\ncan break training and take it easy. Their work goes on steadily<br />\nfor eight months. Moreover, the small number of available men<br />\ndoes not permit staff members to take holidays every other week,<br />\nfor \"copy\" must be written.<br />\nIt is only natural, therefore, when a man has worked on a publication for two or three years, and has not attained a position on the<br />\nboard which carries with it a vast amount of prestige, his natural<br />\ninclination is to quit. And quit he usually does, doing great harm<br />\nto the publication. We realize full well that ideally it is fine to<br />\nhave men work every week for three or four years for pure fun<br />\nand through pure \"spirit,\" but, after all, human nature is unfortunately human nature. Giving these men an additional incentive<br />\nwill result in a great improvement in the quality and quantity of<br />\nwork that they will do for the publication.<br />\nThere are cases which we can quote of men who have been<br />\nforced to resign position on the NEWS-LETTER because they needed<br />\nthe time for some outside work which would be remunerative. Is<br />\nit not far better to have such men carry on? It is a well-known<br />\nfact that if an athlete is in need of funds he can nearly always find<br />\nsinecures to supply them. In the case of publications, which can<br />\nbe, comparatively, as profitable undertakings as larger newspapers,<br />\nwe see no reason why the men who give up much valuable time<br />\nshould not be allowed to realize on their efforts.<br />\nThe plan is not original at Hopkins. Princeton, for example,<br />\nhas been remurerating members of publications for over eighteen<br />\nyears. The members of all college dailies and a majority of semiweeklies, as well as most comics, have employed similar plans for<br />\na number of years. The idea has received the approval here of<br />\nsuch men as Dean Ames, Dr. Wight, Mr. S. Page Nelson, and the<br />\nentire faculty committee on student affairs.<br />\nWe hope that the feeling expressed in the letter in the \"Mailbag\"<br />\ndoes not represent widespread opinion, for we feel that, under the<br />\nconditions mentioned, there is nothing unfair or unduly \"professionalistic\" in the plan. It is merely a means to accomplish two<br />\nends; first, to improve the quality of the publications by affording<br />\nkeener competition, and second, to afford an additional reward for<br />\nthose men to whom great quantities of glory does not accrue.<br /><br />\nCORRIDOR<br />\nThis room will be quite peaceful, if I close the door.<br />\nThe music tires me; we will dance some more<br />\nWhen I have rested; there :\u2014we'll only stay<br />\nA moment, since the music is so gay.<br />\nThe sound snaps off like an electric light;<br />\nComes tolerance, inertia close to wisdom, peace;<br />\nSoon we'll return, and dance away the night<br />\nTo that young tragic tune; I like this short release<br />\nFrom hectic, maddened, happy, noisy youth . .<br />\nThis lack of feeling . . . it may be, in truth,<br />\nA subtle fusion of the music's shrill appeal . .<br />\nI guess that wisdom is to never feel . . .<br />\nPhilosophy . . .

In his<br />\nlongings for tonight he had painted many dreams, sung the beauty<br />\nof Eurydice, touched in his sleep the gleaming ivory of her arm,<br />\nseen clear her profile on the emptiness of night, and smelled<br />\nSpring's fragrance in her silken hair. These had been his visions<br />\nof tonight\u2014and now\u2014was it the taint of sorrow on the rain-swept<br />\nair, or some foresight of ill, or was it but the flatness of achieved<br />\ndesire?

Dr. Motley emphasized the value of such a<br />\nbuilding in providing for the students' social life, and of the desirability of perpetuating it.

No doubt he<br />\nwas congratulated by many!<br />\nThe most astounding fact, however, was that the initiate did not<br />\neven know what the pin meant! To<br />\nblame this on the colored brother's<br />\nstupidity is useless, for we have<br />\nonly to remember the days of the<br />\n\"sweatbox.\" As yet the question<br /><br />\nhas not come before the Interfratemity Board, but certainly that<br />\ngroup will at least bar the new fraternity man from representative<br />\nmembership on the Board.<br />\nBut to continue the story, in fairness to the fraternity involved. The<br />\nnegro is no longer proudly wearing<br />\nthe badge\u2014which, by the way, he<br />\nconsidered at first to be an army<br />\nmedal!\u2014and he was not excommunicated from the fraternity,<br />\neither.
