Comment on the<br />\nscheme seems almost unnecessary; so many arguments on both<br />\nsides have appeared in our editorial and news columns within<br />\nthe past year that we merely voice our approval of the Trustees<br />\naction. There can be no doubt of our position in the matter.<br />\nAs usual, however, there is a fly in the ointment; no one but<br />\nPresident Goodnow seems to know just what plan will be used,<br />\nand Dr. Goodnow appears to be unwilling or unprepared to divulge the details of the manner in which the reorganized uni\u2022 versity will function.<br />\nWe understand that several possible methods might be employed in putting Johns Hopkins upon a purely \"advanced<br />\nstudy\" basis. It is known that the university will have to provide, for a time at least, for the instruction that formally was<br />\ngiven in the Freshman and Sophomore years. A junior college<br />\nin connection with the advanced work, the placing of the burden<br />\n\u2022 of preliminary teaching entirely upon the city high schools, or<br />\nthe continuance of the College for Teachers; any one of these<br />\nsystems might be used to bridge the gap. According to reports<br />\nwhich are not easily verifiable, the last of these is in favor at<br />\npresent.<br />\nThe disadvantages of all three are too obvious to need further comment; it is our belief that the present undergraduate<br />\nschool is far superior to them in every respect. When the New<br />\nPlan cs put into effect we advocate a complete break with the<br />\npast, a complete reorganization utton an entirely new basis. It<br />\nis only through the elimination of all elementary instruction<br />\nidea-of advanced work-can be made effeetivetteachers<br />\nCourses, Junior Colleges and all other ideas of similar nature<br />\nshould be dropped with the undergraduate school as hindrances<br />\nand useless burdens.<br />\nIf the Johns Hopkins University attempts to substitute<br />\nevil for evil there is no point to the reorganization. It is our<br />\nhope and belief that Dr. Goodnow does intend to go the limit<br />\nand make a complete change. If he does not,\u2014why then we<br />\nwould prefer the present undergraduate school with all of its<br />\nfailings.<br />\nYes, the news is good\u2014but we still await the details of<br />\ntlie place\u2014.<br />\n<br />\nRULES ARE RULES<br />\nAthletes on the black list -are strictly barred from representing Johns Hopkins on any team. It always has been our<br />\nimpression that the non-athletic activities were run on the same<br />\nbasis. And yet we look around and see various men who are<br />\nin the well-known scolastie difficulties writing for publications,<br />\nserving on committees, singing. acting, and in other ways representing the university in activities. In one case a man has left<br />\nthe undergraduate and continues to head an important board.<br />\nWe hold no personal animus to any of these men, but rules<br />\nshould work both ways.<br />\n<br />\nWe cannot account for a Hopkins team playing two games in<br />\none afternoOn, but apparently<br />\nthat is just the thing they,did, for<br />\n<br />\nto $190<br />\nRound Trip<br />\n<br />\n$170<br />\n<br />\nTOURIST THIRD CABIN<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Apts., Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nures.

Comment on the<br />\nscheme seems almost unnecessary; so many arguments on both<br />\nsides have appeared in our editorial and news columns within<br />\nthe past year that we merely voice our approval of the Trustees<br />\naction. There can be no doubt of our position in the matter.<br />\nAs usual, however, there is a fly in the ointment; no one but<br />\nPresident Goodnow seems to know just what plan will be used,<br />\nand Dr. Goodnow appears to be unwilling or unprepared to divulge the details of the manner in which the reorganized uni\u2022 versity will function.<br />\nWe understand that several possible methods might be employed in putting Johns Hopkins upon a purely \"advanced<br />\nstudy\" basis. It is known that the university will have to provide, for a time at least, for the instruction that formally was<br />\ngiven in the Freshman and Sophomore years. A junior college<br />\nin connection with the advanced work, the placing of the burden<br />\n\u2022 of preliminary teaching entirely upon the city high schools, or<br />\nthe continuance of the College for Teachers; any one of these<br />\nsystems might be used to bridge the gap. According to reports<br />\nwhich are not easily verifiable, the last of these is in favor at<br />\npresent.<br />\nThe disadvantages of all three are too obvious to need further comment; it is our belief that the present undergraduate<br />\nschool is far superior to them in every respect. When the New<br />\nPlan cs put into effect we advocate a complete break with the<br />\npast, a complete reorganization utton an entirely new basis. It<br />\nis only through the elimination of all elementary instruction<br />\nidea-of advanced work-can be made effeetivetteachers<br />\nCourses, Junior Colleges and all other ideas of similar nature<br />\nshould be dropped with the undergraduate school as hindrances<br />\nand useless burdens.<br />\nIf the Johns Hopkins University attempts to substitute<br />\nevil for evil there is no point to the reorganization. It is our<br />\nhope and belief that Dr. Goodnow does intend to go the limit<br />\nand make a complete change. If he does not,\u2014why then we<br />\nwould prefer the present undergraduate school with all of its<br />\nfailings.<br />\nYes, the news is good\u2014but we still await the details of<br />\ntlie place\u2014.<br /><br />\nRULES ARE RULES<br />\nAthletes on the black list -are strictly barred from representing Johns Hopkins on any team.
