The<br />\nexistence of twelve or more parties makes intelligent legislation<br />\nan impossibility, according to Dr.<br />\nMattern, and the cabinet must<br />\ncarry through all important legislative measures.<br />\nIn addition to the .a bove hindrances, the country, at the present time, is laboring under other<br />\nstaggering burdens. Among those<br />\ncited were the\u00b7 huge reparation<br />\nbill, the loss of credit, inabilty . to<br />\npay many of her present debts,<br />\nanc;l th,e great numbers of starvil~g<br />\nunemployed. He\u00b7 .a lso added the<br />\npre\u00b7v ailance of some m~smanage\u00ad<br />\n!nt;nt of the public funds.<br />\n'Dr. Mattern stressed the fact<br />\nthat in considering the present<br />\nstate of affairs in Germany and<br />\nthe National Socialist party, Hitler's personality must be taken<br />\ninto account.<br />\nHitler Aqstrian<br />\nHitler was born in Austria.<br />\nDisappointed hopes caused by the<br />\nearly death of his father, acord\u00b7<br />\ning to Dr. Mattern, led to much<br />\nof the radicalism of the man today. He was attracted to Germany by the greater prevalance<br />\nof national feeling there. The<br />\ninteresting fact was disclosed<br />\nthat, at present, Hitler is a man<br />\nwithout a country-having \u00b7lost<br />\nhis Austrian citizenship during the<br />\nwar, and never having become a<br />\ncitizen of Germany.<br />\nHe first sprang into prominence<br />\nwhen he took an active part in<br />\nsurpressing<br />\nthe<br />\ncommunistic<br />\nmovement in Bavaria. Later he<br />\nwas one of the principal participants in a plot to take over the<br />\ngovernment of Germany; plot<br />\nthat failed, and resulted in Hitler<br />\nbeing sentenced to prison for a<br />\nperiod of five years.<br />\nReleased From Prison<br />\nHe obtained release in six<br />\nmonths, and took up his present<br />\nwork as leader of the National<br />\nSocialist Party. In this connection Dr. Mattern made the statement that he considered Hitler as<br />\nmore or less \u00b7 of a pathological<br />\ncase, or at least one on the border<br />\nline. He stressed the fact that<br />\nHitler talks too much, boasts too<br />\nmuch, as well as promising and<br />\nattacking too much. He quoted<br />\na remar~ of the party leader,<br />\nmade when the subject of a forceful seizure of the present government was brought up. Hitler at<br />\nthat time said: \"We need not<br />\nmarch on Berlin, when we are<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nalready<br />\n<br />\nsure<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\nthis<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Maryland. Although<br />\nthe date for a match has not been<br />\ndecided upon, the club believes<br />\nthat it will take place a little after<br />\nthe Christmas holiday.<br />\nIn order to prepare for the<br />\nmatch, the members of the club<br />\nhave been playing in a roundrobin tournament. This tournament was closed last Thursday.<br />\nThe club has four rather skilled<br />\nplayers who will probably represent the university. They are 0.<br />\nSugar, A. M. Potts, L.

The<br />\nexistence of twelve or more parties makes intelligent legislation<br />\nan impossibility, according to Dr.<br />\nMattern, and the cabinet must<br />\ncarry through all important legislative measures.<br />\nIn addition to the .a bove hindrances, the country, at the present time, is laboring under other<br />\nstaggering burdens. Among those<br />\ncited were the\u00b7 huge reparation<br />\nbill, the loss of credit, inabilty . to<br />\npay many of her present debts,<br />\nanc;l th,e great numbers of starvil~g<br />\nunemployed. He\u00b7 .a lso added the<br />\npre\u00b7v ailance of some m~smanage\u00ad<br />\n!nt;nt of the public funds.<br />\n'Dr. Mattern stressed the fact<br />\nthat in considering the present<br />\nstate of affairs in Germany and<br />\nthe National Socialist party, Hitler's personality must be taken<br />\ninto account.<br />\nHitler Aqstrian<br />\nHitler was born in Austria.<br />\nDisappointed hopes caused by the<br />\nearly death of his father, acord\u00b7<br />\ning to Dr. Mattern, led to much<br />\nof the radicalism of the man today. He was attracted to Germany by the greater prevalance<br />\nof national feeling there. The<br />\ninteresting fact was disclosed<br />\nthat, at present, Hitler is a man<br />\nwithout a country-having \u00b7lost<br />\nhis Austrian citizenship during the<br />\nwar, and never having become a<br />\ncitizen of Germany.<br />\nHe first sprang into prominence<br />\nwhen he took an active part in<br />\nsurpressing<br />\nthe<br />\ncommunistic<br />\nmovement in Bavaria. Later he<br />\nwas one of the principal participants in a plot to take over the<br />\ngovernment of Germany; plot<br />\nthat failed, and resulted in Hitler<br />\nbeing sentenced to prison for a<br />\nperiod of five years.<br />\nReleased From Prison<br />\nHe obtained release in six<br />\nmonths, and took up his present<br />\nwork as leader of the National<br />\nSocialist Party. In this connection Dr. Mattern made the statement that he considered Hitler as<br />\nmore or less \u00b7 of a pathological<br />\ncase, or at least one on the border<br />\nline. He stressed the fact that<br />\nHitler talks too much, boasts too<br />\nmuch, as well as promising and<br />\nattacking too much. He quoted<br />\na remar~ of the party leader,<br />\nmade when the subject of a forceful seizure of the present government was brought up. Hitler at<br />\nthat time said: \"We need not<br />\nmarch on Berlin, when we are<br />\n0<br /><br />\nalready<br /><br />\nsure<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\nthis<br /><br />\nUniversity of Maryland. Although<br />\nthe date for a match has not been<br />\ndecided upon, the club believes<br />\nthat it will take place a little after<br />\nthe Christmas holiday.<br />\nIn order to prepare for the<br />\nmatch, the members of the club<br />\nhave been playing in a roundrobin tournament. This tournament was closed last Thursday.<br />\nThe club has four rather skilled<br />\nplayers who will probably represent the university. They are 0.<br />\nSugar, A. M. Potts, L.
