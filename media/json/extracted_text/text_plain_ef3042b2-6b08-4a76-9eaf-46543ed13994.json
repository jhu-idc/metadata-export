Before going to Homewood, President Ira Remsen made<br />\nan address, explaining the plans for<br />\nthe proposed technological school,<br />\nand the members of the party spent<br />\na short time in going over the present University buildings.<br />\nDr. Michel I. Pupin, head of the<br />\ndepartment of electrical engineering<br />\nat Columbia University, New York,<br />\nwas the principal speaker at the<br />\ndinner at the Merchants' Club. He<br />\nmade an eloquent appeal for the<br />\nestablishment of a technological<br />\nschool by Hopkins, and pointed out<br />\nhow advantageous it would be for<br />\nthe South.<br />\nCol. William S. Powell, of Ellicott City, president of the Maryland Editorial Association, told of<br />\nthe impetus which would be given<br />\nthe manufacturing interests of<br />\nMaryland by the establishment of<br />\na technological school. Other speakers were: Messrs. R. Brent Keyser.<br />\nWilliam L. Marbury, B. Howell<br />\nGriswold, Jr., and Senator Hammond of Harford county.<br />\n<br />\nThe University track team won<br />\nthe point trophy at the annual<br />\nGeorgetown indoor meet in Washington on Saturday night, with a<br />\ntotal of 19 points, with Virginia<br />\nsecond, 15 points; Georgetown<br />\nthird, io points, and Princeton,<br />\nYale, and Cornell, each 5 points.<br />\nHopkins score was consistent all<br />\nthrough the evening, receiving<br />\npoints in seven events. The team<br />\nhas developed the last week into<br />\na well-balanced aggregation, which<br />\nis evident from the fact that no<br />\nman scored more than once.<br />\nThe feature performance was<br />\nCaptain Lee's race in the mile. He<br />\nstarted from scratch with J. P.<br />\nJones, of Cornell, the outdoor record holder for the distance. The<br />\ntime was 4.304, and at the finish<br />\nLee was so close that he could have,<br />\ntouched Jones with his outstretched<br />\narm. The result shows the sterling<br />\nquality of Lee's running this year.<br />\nDignan won the shot-put in good<br />\nform; distance, 43 feet 3 inches.<br />\nHorrax took second place in the<br />\nopen handicap hurdles from scratch,<br />\nand also second in the invitation<br />\nhurdles. The latter race did not<br />\ncount for the point trophy. Uhler,<br />\nthe best man from the freshman<br />\n*class, did excellent work in the 44o<br />\nopen, and won second medal after<br />\nthe race had been run in heats. Catlin came in a close second in the<br />\nopen half mile. Two third-place<br />\nmedals came to Tappan in the high<br />\njump and the pole-vault.<br />\nThe results of the meet were<br />\nmore or less a surprise to the crowd<br />\nof supporters Hopkins had at the<br />\ngames. Work hitherto has been<br />\nvery mediocre, indeed, and Hopkins<br />\nhas hardly held her own in the previous indoor meets of the winter;<br />\nbut the work of the coaches since<br />\nthe Armory meet has been centered<br />\nupon the development of some<br />\ntwelve men in order to have as<br />\nmany as possible win points, instead of depending- upon two or<br />\nthree stars. A well balanced team<br />\nwent, therefore, to Washington on<br />\nSaturday, and seven of the members contributed to the score that<br />\nwon the meet. One first place,<br />\nfour second places, and two third<br />\nplaces netted the nineteen - points,.<br />\nwhich is four more than Virginia<br />\nwon. All of this gives promise of<br />\na strong team for the spring- meets<br />\nwhich begin after the Easter vacation.

Before going to Homewood, President Ira Remsen made<br />\nan address, explaining the plans for<br />\nthe proposed technological school,<br />\nand the members of the party spent<br />\na short time in going over the present University buildings.<br />\nDr. Michel I. Pupin, head of the<br />\ndepartment of electrical engineering<br />\nat Columbia University, New York,<br />\nwas the principal speaker at the<br />\ndinner at the Merchants' Club. He<br />\nmade an eloquent appeal for the<br />\nestablishment of a technological<br />\nschool by Hopkins, and pointed out<br />\nhow advantageous it would be for<br />\nthe South.<br />\nCol. William S. Powell, of Ellicott City, president of the Maryland Editorial Association, told of<br />\nthe impetus which would be given<br />\nthe manufacturing interests of<br />\nMaryland by the establishment of<br />\na technological school. Other speakers were: Messrs. R. Brent Keyser.<br />\nWilliam L. Marbury, B. Howell<br />\nGriswold, Jr., and Senator Hammond of Harford county.<br /><br />\nThe University track team won<br />\nthe point trophy at the annual<br />\nGeorgetown indoor meet in Washington on Saturday night, with a<br />\ntotal of 19 points, with Virginia<br />\nsecond, 15 points; Georgetown<br />\nthird, io points, and Princeton,<br />\nYale, and Cornell, each 5 points.<br />\nHopkins score was consistent all<br />\nthrough the evening, receiving<br />\npoints in seven events. The team<br />\nhas developed the last week into<br />\na well-balanced aggregation, which<br />\nis evident from the fact that no<br />\nman scored more than once.<br />\nThe feature performance was<br />\nCaptain Lee's race in the mile. He<br />\nstarted from scratch with J. P.<br />\nJones, of Cornell, the outdoor record holder for the distance. The<br />\ntime was 4.304, and at the finish<br />\nLee was so close that he could have,<br />\ntouched Jones with his outstretched<br />\narm. The result shows the sterling<br />\nquality of Lee's running this year.<br />\nDignan won the shot-put in good<br />\nform; distance, 43 feet 3 inches.<br />\nHorrax took second place in the<br />\nopen handicap hurdles from scratch,<br />\nand also second in the invitation<br />\nhurdles. The latter race did not<br />\ncount for the point trophy. Uhler,<br />\nthe best man from the freshman<br />\n*class, did excellent work in the 44o<br />\nopen, and won second medal after<br />\nthe race had been run in heats. Catlin came in a close second in the<br />\nopen half mile. Two third-place<br />\nmedals came to Tappan in the high<br />\njump and the pole-vault.<br />\nThe results of the meet were<br />\nmore or less a surprise to the crowd<br />\nof supporters Hopkins had at the<br />\ngames. Work hitherto has been<br />\nvery mediocre, indeed, and Hopkins<br />\nhas hardly held her own in the previous indoor meets of the winter;<br />\nbut the work of the coaches since<br />\nthe Armory meet has been centered<br />\nupon the development of some<br />\ntwelve men in order to have as<br />\nmany as possible win points, instead of depending- upon two or<br />\nthree stars. A well balanced team<br />\nwent, therefore, to Washington on<br />\nSaturday, and seven of the members contributed to the score that<br />\nwon the meet. One first place,<br />\nfour second places, and two third<br />\nplaces netted the nineteen - points,.<br />\nwhich is four more than Virginia<br />\nwon. All of this gives promise of<br />\na strong team for the spring- meets<br />\nwhich begin after the Easter vacation.
