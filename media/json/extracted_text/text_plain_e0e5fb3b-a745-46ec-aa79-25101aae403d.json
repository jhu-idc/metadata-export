The committee has<br />\nalready called for undergraduate housing in Wolman<br />\nHall and a plan to eliminate mandatory food service<br />\nsubscription by dormitory freshmen.

I feel, as do a<br />\nnumber of administration and faculty<br />\nmembers, that the present council is not<br />\ntruly representative of the student body, and<br />\nthat this is certainly reflected in the degree<br />\nof participation in Student Council activities<br />\nby the students. Because the council lacks a<br />\ntruly representative structure, the issues<br />\nthat have memerged from the council in the<br />\npast have not been of a nature conducive to<br />\nwidespread student involvement. The<br />\ncouncil has fallen prey to a small group of<br />\nindividuals who determine campus issues<br />\nand subsequently direct Council energies<br />\ntoward these issues in session after session<br />\nof fruitless debate. Issues that are important<br />\nto the students at Hopkins should emerge<br />\nnaturally from the body itself, and the only<br />\nway this can come about is by making the<br />\nstructure of the Council more reflective of<br />\nstudent desires and interests. We must be<br />\nable to voice and to implement these desires<br />\nin such a manner that students will find it an<br />\nenjoyable as well as a meaningful experience to take part in the activities of the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nThe first step in stimulating student<br />\nsupport for council programs is to broaden<br />\nthe representation of students on the council.<br />\nThis could be accomplished by the sub<br />\nstitution_ of a student senate_ composed of<br />\nGerald Bates is a candidate for Student Council<br />\npresident. He is opposing Martin Vogel in today's<br />\nran-off.<br />\n<br />\nelected representatives from dormitory<br />\nhouses, campus organizations, fraternities,<br />\ncommuters, and off campus students for the<br />\npresently structured student council.<br />\nSimilar senates are successfully in operation<br />\nat Brown, Fordham and Antioch, and such a<br />\nstructure would greatly improve communication between the council and the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nSecondly, the student government should<br />\nprovide the impetus for meaningful involvement in urban and environmental<br />\naffairs. The council, as an organization<br />\nsupposedly reflective of student intersts,<br />\nshould not limit its focus to the internal affairs of the University when so many of the<br />\nproblems of the city and urban environment<br />\ngo begging for the talents of students of the<br />\ncalibre that we have at Hopkins.<br />\nRelevant programs for student involvement could be sponsored by the council<br />\nin conjunction with local community groups,<br />\nhospitals, consumer protection agencies,<br />\nenvironmental action groups, etc. The<br />\nstudent council, by taking the initiative in<br />\nthese types of activities could be a very<br />\npositive stimulant to student activism.<br />\nBut the most important factor in these<br />\nsteps to stimulate student participation must<br />\nbe that the issues and programs considered<br />\nand implemented by the council must be<br />\ntruly relective of the interests and<br />\nmotivations of the student body. This is the<br />\nonly means by which the Council can remove<br />\nthe taint of clannishness and isolation that<br />\npresently pervades our notions of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\n<br />\n\fApril 23, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nThe universe as seen from an outhouse<br />\nBy LES KAUFMAN<br />\n\"Some people think it's an<br />\noversized bathroom,\" I thought to<br />\nmyself, looking across the freshman playing field from my stone<br />\nperch in front of the upperclass<br />\ndorms.

After<br />\nunlocking the shutters I began to<br />\nroll the roof back by hand, when it<br />\nstruck me that although I was<br />\nwearing only an undershirt, I was<br />\nwarm enough.

They<br />\ncollected strange pictures. Little<br />\ndid they know that the strange<br />\npictures that they knew and loved<br />\nso much at 27 rue de Fleurus would<br />\nbecome one of the finest collections<br />\nof modern art the world has ever<br />\nknown.<br />\nThey collected pictures painted<br />\nby their friends Henri (Matisse),<br />\nPablo (Picasso), Juan (Gris),<br />\nPaul (Cezanne), and many others.<br />\nIt was a good thing that the four<br />\nAmericans did this, because at that<br />\ntime other picture collectors didn't<br />\nlike those strange pictures.<br />\nAll Good Things<br />\nAfter many years and good times<br />\nat the 27 rue de Fleurus apartment<br />\nthe Steins moved away and their<br />\ncollection of strange pictures was<br />\n<br />\nbroken up and sent to all corners of<br />\nthe world. The pictures were very<br />\nsad about this because they had<br />\ndeveloped a very close friendship<br />\namong themselves.<br />\nSoon, nobody remembered just<br />\nwhich pictures had been together in<br />\nthe apartment. (The pictures did<br />\nbut they couldn't tell anybody.) But<br />\nluckily Gertrude had taken a<br />\nphotograph of the 27 rue de Fleurus<br />\napartment. All the pictures were in<br />\nthe photograph.<br />\nLast year, the Museum of<br />\nModern Art found the photograph<br />\nand planned a reunion for all the<br />\npictures in it.

Ile could not tell me<br />\nwhy. Ile only knew that some one or some thing was calling him back<br />\nand he had to go at once. Apologizing profusely, he left me alone on<br />\nthe lake and tiortaged to the nearest town (Moose Jaw, well over a<br />\nthousand miles, and pois(m sumac every inch), and there he chartered<br />\n:t Ford Tri-M()tor tttd flew home.<br />\nWell sir, at first he felt like an tit ter dolt.

This would also include<br />\nthe return of all American POW's,<br />\nDefinite Date<br />\nChurch added, \"The notion of a<br />\nresidual force to be left behind<br />\nmust be rejected. Obviously,<br />\nnothing in the long run will be<br />\ngained by an American garrison in<br />\nSouth Viet Nam.\"<br />\nSetting a definite date for the<br />\ncompletion of the withdrawal by<br />\nthe President was the second point<br />\nof the end-the-war policy. \"As the<br />\nFrench learned before us, the<br />\nrelease of prisoners does not<br />\nprecede, but follows the commitment to withdrawal,\" claimed<br />\nChurch.<br />\nThe final point of the joint<br />\nresolution stated that American<br />\nforces shall not participate in any<br />\ninvasion of North Viet Nam, nor in<br />\nany more incursions into Laos or<br />\n(continued on page 4)<br /><br />\nThe first report, issued in<br />\nOctober 1969, indicates that<br />\nthe medical school is most<br />\nanxious to end its role in the<br />\nventure, but because BMC<br />\nstill exists, the Hospital's<br />\ninvolvement will continue<br />\nindefinitely.<br />\nKaberle said of the Corporation, \"If things go along<br />\nas they are today, this will<br />\nalways be a subsidy<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\nSo far he has reworked the<br />\nbudget for BMC's holdings to<br />\nslow their deficit down to<br />\n$55,100. Since most of their<br />\nleases are on student housing<br />\nfacilities, he feels that he<br />\ncannot raise rents, even<br />\nthough expenses are rising at<br />\na rate of four to five per cent<br />\neach year.<br />\nThe 550 Building, originally<br />\nconstructed in 1961 to provide<br />\noffice space for Hospital<br />\npersonnel, is expected to run<br />\n$119,000 in the red this year.<br />\nAlthough now fully occupied,<br />\nwith eight floors in use as<br />\nhousing for married students,<br />\nmaintenance costs and a<br />\nbuilding loan cause the loss.<br />\nThe Broadway Apartments, a block of low-cost<br />\nhousing behind the 550<br />\nBuilding, are expected to lose<br />\nalmost $15,000 due to cheap<br />\nconstruction and high maintenance costs.<br />\nNext to this group of<br />\nbuildings is a shopping center<br />\nowned by BMC. Although<br />\nalmost half the building is<br />\nvacant now, Kaberle expects<br />\nto have three of the four<br />\nempty rooms filled with<br />\ntenants by July. This would<br />\nlimit the center's loss to<br />\n$4,500.<br />\nThe only profit-making<br />\nconcern that BMC owns is the<br />\nSheraton Inn, down Broadway from the Hospital. The<br />\nhotel is expected to net more<br />\nthan ever this year; the gain<br />\nis estimated at $74,500.<br />\nThe University has sole<br />\nownership of only two en-<br /><br />\nMarven Kaberle<br /><br />\nterprises, Reed Hall and its<br />\nCafeteria. In the present<br />\nbudget, which ends fiscal 1971<br />\nin June, Reed Hall is set for a<br />\nloss of $126,200, while the<br />\ncafeteria is anticipated to<br />\nbreak even.<br />\nKaberle, who is also<br />\nmanaging these facilities,<br />\nexpects the dining service to<br />\nlose money nevertheless. The<br />\ndeficit for the building itself,<br />\nhe indicated,stems<br />\nfrom the lack of kitchens in<br />\none wing.<br />\nOne of the Hospital's<br />\nproperties, a parking garage<br />\nbuilt in 1967 next to the<br />\nhospital, clears well over<br />\n$100,000.

Perhaps it was the experience of<br />\nlast spring when for the first time large numbers of<br />\nstudents adopted extra-legal methods of expressing<br />\ntheir grievances that promoted the school's higher-ups<br />\nto be unusually responsive especially concerning undergraduate education to the Student Council this year.<br />\nThis is not to say that good Student government is a<br />\npanacea,as the administration has its usual practice of<br />\nignoring student demands on such issues as the<br />\ndiscipline code and governance. But it does give a<br />\ncertain importance to today's second day of balloting for<br />\nStudent Council president.<br />\nThe office can be effective if there is a good man<br />\nfilling it, and luckily both candidates seem capable of<br />\nhandling the job. Gerald Bates has conducted a very<br />\nimaginative campaign reasing some good points about<br />\nthe role of the Council in the lives of students. His<br />\nrecommendations for Student Senate is definitely<br />\nworthy of study. But we would have to give the edge to<br />\nMartin Vogel. Over the past year he has been one of the<br />\nmost active of the SC's members. Many of the Council's<br />\naccomplishments are due to his initiatives. While Bates<br />\ntalks well, effectiveness is still annunknown quantity.<br />\nVogel has proven he can get the job done, so our vote<br />\nwould have to go to him. But whoever wins, we would<br />\nurge the loser to stay active in student affairs as the<br />\nCouncil needs more of the type of ideas that have been<br />\nexpressed in this campaign.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\n\"Good Thinking, Chief \u2014 And If This Crime Wave<br />\nGets Any Worse,I Say We Should Call A Policeman-<br /><br />\n'WM 6F<br />\ndagYggg<br /><br />\nQUIT<br />\nTo the Editors;<br />\nFor some time, I, a faculty<br />\nwife, have been reading your<br />\nnewspaper with interest and<br />\npleasure.

The committee has<br />\nalready called for undergraduate housing in Wolman<br />\nHall and a plan to eliminate mandatory food service<br />\nsubscription by dormitory freshmen. Both decisions are<br />\nsound, and we hope that financial pressures will not<br />\ncause the interim President to abandon undergraduates<br />\nby ignoring the proposals of this committee. But we urge<br />\nboth the committee and Dr. Eisenhower to take a<br />\nbroader look at the entire housing problem for members<br />\nof the Hopkins community.<br />\nThe addition of Wolman Hall to the undergraduate<br />\nhousing market should come as welcome relief to some,<br />\nwith its relatively low prices, and convenience.<br />\nBut the committee has, so far, failed to move towards<br />\nany significant improvements in the desperate housing<br />\nsituation. The committee must urge on the University a<br />\nmore aggressive and helpful approach to the housing<br />\nproblem, especially for undergraduates.

I feel, as do a<br />\nnumber of administration and faculty<br />\nmembers, that the present council is not<br />\ntruly representative of the student body, and<br />\nthat this is certainly reflected in the degree<br />\nof participation in Student Council activities<br />\nby the students. Because the council lacks a<br />\ntruly representative structure, the issues<br />\nthat have memerged from the council in the<br />\npast have not been of a nature conducive to<br />\nwidespread student involvement. The<br />\ncouncil has fallen prey to a small group of<br />\nindividuals who determine campus issues<br />\nand subsequently direct Council energies<br />\ntoward these issues in session after session<br />\nof fruitless debate. Issues that are important<br />\nto the students at Hopkins should emerge<br />\nnaturally from the body itself, and the only<br />\nway this can come about is by making the<br />\nstructure of the Council more reflective of<br />\nstudent desires and interests. We must be<br />\nable to voice and to implement these desires<br />\nin such a manner that students will find it an<br />\nenjoyable as well as a meaningful experience to take part in the activities of the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nThe first step in stimulating student<br />\nsupport for council programs is to broaden<br />\nthe representation of students on the council.<br />\nThis could be accomplished by the sub<br />\nstitution_ of a student senate_ composed of<br />\nGerald Bates is a candidate for Student Council<br />\npresident. He is opposing Martin Vogel in today's<br />\nran-off.<br /><br />\nelected representatives from dormitory<br />\nhouses, campus organizations, fraternities,<br />\ncommuters, and off campus students for the<br />\npresently structured student council.<br />\nSimilar senates are successfully in operation<br />\nat Brown, Fordham and Antioch, and such a<br />\nstructure would greatly improve communication between the council and the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nSecondly, the student government should<br />\nprovide the impetus for meaningful involvement in urban and environmental<br />\naffairs. The council, as an organization<br />\nsupposedly reflective of student intersts,<br />\nshould not limit its focus to the internal affairs of the University when so many of the<br />\nproblems of the city and urban environment<br />\ngo begging for the talents of students of the<br />\ncalibre that we have at Hopkins.<br />\nRelevant programs for student involvement could be sponsored by the council<br />\nin conjunction with local community groups,<br />\nhospitals, consumer protection agencies,<br />\nenvironmental action groups, etc. The<br />\nstudent council, by taking the initiative in<br />\nthese types of activities could be a very<br />\npositive stimulant to student activism.<br />\nBut the most important factor in these<br />\nsteps to stimulate student participation must<br />\nbe that the issues and programs considered<br />\nand implemented by the council must be<br />\ntruly relective of the interests and<br />\nmotivations of the student body. This is the<br />\nonly means by which the Council can remove<br />\nthe taint of clannishness and isolation that<br />\npresently pervades our notions of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br /><br />\nApril 23, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nThe universe as seen from an outhouse<br />\nBy LES KAUFMAN<br />\n\"Some people think it's an<br />\noversized bathroom,\" I thought to<br />\nmyself, looking across the freshman playing field from my stone<br />\nperch in front of the upperclass<br />\ndorms.

That they are living on a<br />\nspeck of dust, that a person should<br />\nbat least be aware of the far<br />\ngrander things going on in places<br />\nhe can not reach?

After<br />\nunlocking the shutters I began to<br />\nroll the roof back by hand, when it<br />\nstruck me that although I was<br />\nwearing only an undershirt, I was<br />\nwarm enough.

The very\u2018spotting scope<br />\nattached to the larger refractor is<br />\nitself a fairly decent three inch<br />\nrefractor, and a tempermental<br />\neight inch reflector sat in one<br />\ncorner until it was finally carted<br />\ndown to Rowland Hall for repairs.<br />\nA four inch reflector, Dr. Walker's<br />\nown antique, stands at wobbly<br />\nattention near a jumble of equally<br />\nancient brass tubes and wheels, the<br />\nremains of a transit circle.

They<br />\ncollected strange pictures.

The pictures were very<br />\nsad about this because they had<br />\ndeveloped a very close friendship<br />\namong themselves.<br />\nSoon, nobody remembered just<br />\nwhich pictures had been together in<br />\nthe apartment. (The pictures did<br />\nbut they couldn't tell anybody.) But<br />\nluckily Gertrude had taken a<br />\nphotograph of the 27 rue de Fleurus<br />\napartment. All the pictures were in<br />\nthe photograph.<br />\nLast year, the Museum of<br />\nModern Art found the photograph<br />\nand planned a reunion for all the<br />\npictures in it.

Certainly it falls into none of these<br />\ncategories, but just as cert:doly it exists.

I low many times have you been absolutely certain something was going to happen hundreds or even thousands of miles away<br />\nand, sure enough, it did?<br />\nLet me tell you about a case I am fortunately able to document.<br />\nSome years ago I went fishing with my dear friend Donald L.

It was hellishly difficult to<br />\nget there, but we did not mind, for the moment we dropped our lines<br />\nW( each caught :t splendid crappie. M ine weighed just over 300 pounds.<br />\nDonald's was somewhat smaller, but, by far the friendlier.<br />\nImagine toy surprise then when, before we could throw our lines<br />\nback for another try, Donald suddenly leaped up and cried he'd had a<br />\npremonition that he must go home immediately. Ile could not tell me<br />\nwhy. Ile only knew that some one or some thing was calling him back<br />\nand he had to go at once. Apologizing profusely, he left me alone on<br />\nthe lake and tiortaged to the nearest town (Moose Jaw, well over a<br />\nthousand miles, and pois(m sumac every inch), and there he chartered<br />\n:t Ford Tri-M()tor tttd flew home.<br />\nWell sir, at first he felt like an tit ter dolt.

Ile flang open the door. And there, by George, he saw<br />\nwhere the whimliering was coming Innn: someone had left a basket on<br />\nt he hack stoop!<br />\nWell sir, who can blame Donald for crying a cry of joy and triumph'? What a find! A whimpering basket! That's something you don't<br />\nsee every day, let me tell you!<br />\nAnd so today, as you know of course, Donald L.

Next Sunday, in fact, he completes his -I Ill consecutive year 00<br />\nEd Sullivan.<br /><br />\nAs for me, I too was a beneficiary of Donald's ESP, for when he<br />\nleft me alone on the lake I figured I would get to drink all\u2014not just<br />\nhalf\u2014of the goodly supply of Miller High Life Beer we had brought<br />\nalong, and as you know of course, Miller High Life is never so welcome<br />\nas it is on a tranquil sylvan lake while a flock of Canada geese darkens<br />\nthe sky above. Of course, Miller isn't bad in a noisy bar either while a<br />\nflock of American coeds darkens the jukebox. For that matter, it's even<br />\ngreat in the dorm while your cruddy roommate darkens the tub.<br />\nBut as it happened, I never did get to drink all our Miller High<br />\nLife because I forgot how well sound travels across a sylvan lake. No<br />\nsooner did I pop my first can of Miller when \u2014lo and behold!\u2014ten<br />\nMounties galloped out of the forest singing selections from Rose Marie!<br />\nOf course, I shared my Miller with them, and gladly, because I know<br />\nit's hard being a Mountie, especially if you're an alto.
