The proposal is expected<br />\nto be made official in a few<br />\nweeks, at which time it will be<br />\nopen to criticism, suggestions<br />\nand comments for 30 days.<br />\nSusan Broadbent, director of<br />\nfinancial aid at Hopkins, feels<br />\nthat the regulation \"is discriminating against needy students\"<br />\nbecause a student who does not<br />\nneed financial aid will not be<br />\naffected by the regulation<br />\nwhether he has registered or<br />\nnot. It will only enforce registration for those who need<br />\nfederal financial aid. Broadbent<br />\nsaid,\"I am hoping [the regulation] disappears and goes<br />\naway,\" not only because of its<br />\ndiscriminatory nature, but because it would cause \"an adsministrative nightmare.\"<br />\nIf the proposal becomes law<br />\nthe Financial Aid Office will<br />\n<br />\ncomply because Broadbent cannot put the University at odds<br />\nwith the law unless the trustees<br />\nexplicitely state that the institution cannot follow the new<br />\nlegislation. The office will<br />\ncheck and make sure that students eligible for financial aid<br />\nhave registered and the students<br />\nwill be asked to produce a copy<br />\nof the letter from the selective<br />\nservice acknowledging their<br />\nregistration.<br />\n\u2022 Financial Aid will request<br />\nnon-registered students to sign<br />\na questionnaire stating their<br />\nreasons for not registering. At<br />\nthis point, Broadbent does not<br />\nknow what will happen to the<br />\nnon-registered students who<br />\nwill be denied federal aid. She<br />\nfeels that the regulation will be<br />\n\"an additional unnecessary<br />\nburden on financial aid\" and<br />\nshe disapproves of using universities as \"an arm of the law.\"<br />\nThis opinion is shared by<br />\nmany students at Hopkins.<br />\nHousemaster Jeff Martin said,<br />\n\"The two programs should be<br />\ncompletely separate, and stucont. on p. 3<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\nBecause of a lack of patrons, the Rat will be closed on Frida and Saturda) nights.<br />\n<br />\nRathskeller Will Close Weekends<br />\nAs Students Avoid Campus Pub<br />\nBY ANDREW HURLEY<br />\nAND<br />\nMIKE VOGELBAUM<br />\nThe Rathskellar will be closed on Friday and Saturday<br />\nnights starting this semester.<br />\nThe reduced operation of the<br />\nRat is in response to the lack of<br />\nattendence on the two nights.<br />\nAccording to Bettye Miller,<br />\nDirector of Auxiallary Enterprises, only one or two persons<br />\n<br />\nCity Fails To Close Traffic Lane<br />\nBy January Date As Anticipated<br />\nBY MARIANNE PERRELLA<br />\nContrary to expectations,<br />\nthe single southbound lane<br />\non North Charles Street has<br />\nnot yet been closed to traffic. While the plan for lane<br />\nclosure has been approved<br />\nby Hopkins administration,<br />\nthe Charles Village Association and the Baltimore<br />\nDepartment of Transit and<br />\nTraffic, progress on the problem appears to be nonexistent.<br />\nIn a meeting with Student<br />\nCouncil members last July,<br />\nPaul Burns, city traffic<br />\nengineer,<br />\nmentioned<br />\nJanuary of this year as a<br />\npossible project completion<br />\ndate. \"This was a very tentative estimate,\" Burns now<br />\nasserts. \"There's a lot involved in a lane closure.'<br />\nThe process involves<br />\nvarious city procedures.

The committee included six<br />\nstudents and Associate Dean of<br />\nStudents, Chris Colombo, who<br />\nworked as a resource person.<br />\nTwo of the problems that the<br />\ncommittee cited are the preference of students to go off<br />\ncampus on weekends, and the<br />\n\"cold\" interior design of the<br />\nRat. The lack of popular musical groups, due to the prohibitive cost of such attractions,<br />\n<br />\nblamed for the decline.<br />\nBased on these problems, the<br />\ncommittee published a set of<br />\nrecommendations. Although it<br />\nrecommended the closing of the<br />\nRat as it is organized now on<br />\nFriday and Saturday nights, the<br />\ncommittee suggested that the<br />\nopportunity for weekend programming be open to the general student body. The Union<br />\nBoard will help coordinate any<br />\nentertainment suggested and<br />\nplanned by students.

Other plans call for the<br />\naddition of endowed faculty<br />\nchairs at SAIS and the establish<br />\nment of more student scholarships. A committee of SAIS<br />\nfaculty members, alumni and<br />\nadministrators drafted these<br />\nplans during a two-year period<br />\nin 1979-80. The committee did<br />\nnot conceive specific plans, but<br />\n<br />\nrather attempted to identify<br />\nareas of future concern for<br />\nSAIS. Once funds are secured,<br />\nmore detailed plans will become<br />\navailable, according to Crowell.<br />\nThe building addition will<br />\nreceive first priority, said<br />\nCrowell. He indicated that<br />\nmost of the addition will be occupied by the library. The remaining space will become avail<br />\nable for student-use areas. This<br />\nexpansion will not be accompanied by an increase in enrollment, and no plans call for such<br />\nan increase. The actual construction probably will not begin for some time, due to the<br />\nneed for permits and negotiations with several concerned<br />\nneighborhood groups.<br />\n<br />\nFellman Survey Results: Faculty<br />\nTeaches Council About Tenure<br />\nBY LAURA CAHAGAN<br />\nThe Student Council has received \"a hell of a response\" to<br />\nits faculty teaching survey, according to SC President Doug<br />\nFellman.

Fellman compared the<br />\ndepartments<br />\nto<br />\n\"little<br />\nfamilies,\" and he said this question showed that faculty<br />\nmembers would speak only for<br />\ntheir own departments.

Research is not incompatible<br />\nwith<br />\nundergraduate education.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nNor is it categorically opposed to breadth and quality of<br />\neducation. The problem, as<br />\nmany see it, comes when<br />\nundergrads perceive the<br />\nresearch orientation as a barrier to creative learning orwhen the faculty really is inaccessible, because of<br />\nresearch obligations.<br />\nA number of academic<br />\nalternatives do exist here, or<br />\nat least they are alleged to<br />\nexist.

An ad-hoc committee, which studied possible<br />\nuses for the dining area after a<br />\nnew dining hall is opened next<br />\nyear, recommended that four<br />\nrooms be created. The plan<br />\ndoes not call for any breaking<br />\nor building of walls.

Fellman likened<br />\nthe area to the Garrett Room in<br />\nthe MSE Library.<br />\nThe basement, where the kitchen is situated, will be a game<br />\nroom and arcade. Krueger believes the arcade will \"make a<br />\nfew bucks.\"<br />\nThe present serving area, in<br />\nthe center of the dining hall,<br />\nwill be a \"multimedia room.\"<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Krueger, the<br />\nroom will be equipped with<br />\n\"videocommunications and<br />\nother facilities aligned with the<br />\nsocial sciences and humanities.\" The committee estimates<br />\nthat approximately ten to<br />\ntwelve thousand dollars will be<br />\nspent on video equipment.<br />\nIn addition to the four large<br />\nrooms, expanded storage space,<br />\na bike room, larger laundry<br />\nroqms and more common kitchens were also recommended.<br />\nSo far, there has not been too<br />\nmuch attention to detail.

Among<br />\nthese are the effort to give students a broader<br />\nbased education and securing assurance that<br />\nundergraduates will no longer have to be<br />\nsubjected to teaching assistants with poor<br />\ncommunicative skills.<br />\nThe TA issue is an old one and at the end<br />\nof last semester finally was brought to the<br />\nattention of the Academic Council. In urging the departments to remedy this problem,<br />\nthe Council made a positive move, if only<br />\nby recognizing that a problem existed.<br />\nHowever, the Academic Council tabled a<br />\nsensible CUS amendment which would have<br />\nbarred questionable first year graduate<br />\nstudents from acting as teaching assistants.<br />\nThrowing the problem to the departments<br />\nis not an efficient solution because a lack of<br />\nuniformity is bound to arise. In the absence<br />\nof further Academic Council action on this<br />\nmatter, it is essential that the deans take an<br />\nactive role in setting and enforcing guidelines<br />\nfor the departments. There is no excuse for<br />\nthe TA issue to remain unresolved by the end<br />\nof this 'semester.<br />\n<br />\nThe effort to secure a liberal arts education for undergraduates is a newer concern,<br />\nbut in the long run, much more important<br />\nthan the TA issue. Last semester witnessed<br />\nthe first steps in achieving this goal. We<br />\nshould expect more substantive gains in the<br />\ncoming semester. Specific proposals must be<br />\nworked out among students, administrators,<br />\nand faculty. If none of these groups take the<br />\ninitiative to move ahead on this issue, it<br />\nwould be appropriate for President Muller,<br />\nwho favors such curriculum changes, to step<br />\nin and get the ball rolling.<br />\nThere is a third issue that we have heard<br />\nlittle about last semester but is bound to be<br />\nthe center of controversy in the coming<br />\nsemester. This is the issue of an alcohol<br />\npolicy. By the time next years freshmen class<br />\nenters Hopkins, those students who will not<br />\nbe legally allowed to drink will approach the<br />\nfifty percent mark. In the next few months<br />\nhard decisions will have to be made about<br />\nenforcing the law, serving liquor and campus social events, and resuscitating a lagging<br />\ncampus social climate.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Ain't A Cop<br />\nEven putting aside the debate over the<br />\nmerits of compulsory draft registration, the<br />\ncurrent proposal to deny federal financial aid<br />\nto male students who fail to register should<br />\nbe opposed. The major objection to the proposal is that it blatantly diceriminates against<br />\nneedy students. Those students who do not<br />\nrequire aid will remain unaffected. The proposal also warps the main principle behind<br />\nfinancial aid: to equalize educational opportunity for Americans of all classes. Under<br />\nthis proposal, patriotism would become a requisite for access to educational opportunities. Finally, the regulation would force<br />\nuniversities to take on the role of policemen.<br />\nIf the federal government is intent on enforcing draft registration it should bear the<br />\nresponsibilities and financial burdens.<br />\nThe issue of financial aid and draft<br />\nregistration was brought up briefly before<br />\nthe Student Council at Wednesday night's<br />\nmeeting. In the Council's recent tradition of<br />\n<br />\navoiding involvement in politics, they chose<br />\nnot to consider taking a stand on the issue.<br />\nWhile keeping away from hot political issues<br />\nis often prudent, in this case it is repulsive.<br />\nIt is one thing to resist endorsing a presidential candidate in a national election; it is quite<br />\nanother to ignore issues, such as financial<br />\naid, that strike at the heart of student concerns. The Student Council's attitude reflects<br />\ntimidity and irresponsibility. Refusing to<br />\neven consider taking a stand just because the<br />\nissue is \"political\" is completely absurd.<br />\nThe Student Council's unwillingness to<br />\nstand by student's interests on this issue does<br />\nnot preclude the administration from doing<br />\nso. Administration and faculties of several<br />\nuniversities have publicly complained about<br />\nthe policy. Formally lodged complaints or<br />\nbehind the scenes lobbying by the administration as a whole or by President<br />\nMuller would surely be welcomed by the<br />\nstudents of Johns Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nRed Tape And Death<br />\nSeveral months ago the Baltimore City plan is time consuming.

We<br />\nwere fortunate to have a teacher native to the language area<br />\nstudied, and to be in the<br />\npresence of a remarkable person. Her famous tiara is now a<br />\ncrown of laurel.<br />\nStories and anecdotes illuminate her legendary and real<br />\nhistory. When she was emigrating from Russia, early, in the<br />\ncentury, all her baggage and<br />\nworldly goods were lost or<br />\nstolen, a material loss she<br />\nstoically shrugged off. Arriving<br />\nat customs in the port of entry,<br />\nshe literally had nothing to<br />\ndeclare but her genius, wit, zest<br />\nand culture.<br />\nBut Dr. Keefer always rose<br />\nabove what she regarded as the<br />\nmerely personal, domestic and<br />\nlogistical superfluities of existence. Her main interests were<br />\npurely impersonal, the great<br />\nthings of the mind and spirit,<br />\n<br />\nthough she would disdain this<br />\npanegyric writing about her, if<br />\nindeed she would even deign to<br />\nread it in her new abode among<br />\nthe eternal stars and the music<br />\nof the spheres.<br />\nMu-sic was her forte. She was<br />\na pianist, also professor of<br />\nmusic appreciation at the Hopkins and the Peabody Conservatory. Her book Music Angels<br />\n(1976) covers a thousand years<br />\nof patronage of music by women. She herself was a patroness, an angel of music.<br />\nThis aristocratic lady was<br />\nalso a prime mover of a Russian<br />\nCulture Society that met monthly in the Garrett Room of the<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library,<br />\nor in her salon on Tudor Arms<br />\nAvenue.<br />\nAs said above, she would<br />\nbrush aside eulogy and ecomia,<br />\nif she could overhear them<br />\nnow\u2014and I suspect she can\u2014<br />\nand so no conventional litany is<br />\noffered here. More fitting,<br />\nwould be a salute.<br />\nLubov Keefer, do-svidanya!<br />\nArthur Dzura<br />\n<br />\nThere Is Life After Graduation With Coupons<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs a recent Hopkins<br />\ngraduate, I would like to share<br />\nwith you thoughts on LifeAfter-Graduation, and, in particular, now hobbies. Without<br />\nnights in the Reserve Room or<br />\nRolling Rock at the Grad Club,<br />\nI have time for leisure.<br />\nAlthough I work for the State<br />\nof Colorado in Denver, evenings and early mornings I am<br />\nfree to pursue my interest in<br />\ncoupon clipping.<br />\nI became interested in<br />\ncoupons when I realized that<br />\nevery week I buy the same<br />\ngroceries. No matter where I<br />\nam, in Denver, Baltimore, or<br />\nPerth Amboy, I invariably<br />\nreach for thei familiar blue box<br />\nof Nabisco Brand Bran Buds,<br />\nfor the stylish bottle of Kikkoman Soy Sauce, the crinkly<br />\nblocks of raman noodles, and<br />\nthe comforting squaw on the<br />\nLand of Lakes margarine box.<br />\n<br />\nOne day, before I threw out a<br />\nnewspaper supplement, I noticed that I could save 20 cents on<br />\nmy next purchase of Wheat,<br />\nRice or Corn Checks. La Choy<br />\nSoy Sauce would save me 7<br />\ncents, and Dial Soap (blue or<br />\ngold) was an outrageous 18<br />\ncents off the regular price. I<br />\nbegan combing the paper for<br />\ncoupons. The coupon caper<br />\nwas a challenge, as well as an<br />\nopportunity to break out of my<br />\nname brand rut.<br />\nBeing a college graduate<br />\ngives you the time to pursue<br />\nand initiate new ideas and<br />\nspecial interests.

But Intersession has come and gone<br />\nand those potted plants still sit<br />\nbefore the Q-Level entrance;<br />\nsmugly photosynthesizing, they<br />\nremain oblivious, like those<br />\nwho placed them there, to the<br />\ncatastrophic changes they have<br />\neffected upon the emotional<br />\nwell-being of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAs everyone knows, the<br />\nplants are a replacement for the<br />\nrow of sofas that once greeted<br />\nthe weary Q-Level entrant with<br />\noffers of comfort and the<br />\nchance to sit and talk with a<br />\nfriend. Now that these same<br />\nsofas have been shoved against<br />\nthe unfeeling walls of the north<br />\nwing, they can offer nothing<br />\nbut unrelieved gloom.<br />\nSit down on one and look<br />\naround. The ceiling is lower<br />\nhere than above the entrance;<br />\nsmoke hangs lower in the air,<br />\nsmells thicker. It's dark;<br />\nsunlight, it' there is any, slips in<br />\nbetween the slats of Venetian<br />\nblinds and around the folds of<br />\nshabby, burlap-colored drapes.<br />\nA collapsible barred fence<br />\nstands in one corner, giving the<br />\nplace a penitentiary pallor.<br />\nThere's no view to speak of;<br />\ndoors are grey and forbidding,<br />\nwalls are a sickly shade of<br />\nwhite, with occasional tan<br />\nsplotches. The only people you<br />\nsee are the haggard students<br />\nand library staffers who stagger<br />\nin and out of the employee kitchen for a coffee fix. Floor<br />\nspace is wide and desolate; the<br />\ntrashcans and ashtrays are spaced too far apart to be easily accessible to most of the people<br />\nwho come here to sit. Is this any<br />\nway to relax?<br />\nNow cast your thoughts back<br />\nward. Remember the sunlight<br />\nthat used to flood in on you<br />\nwhen the sofas were in front of<br />\nthe doors? Remember the ruddy, determined faces of the<br />\npeople as they entered, fresh<br />\nfrom reality, ready to tackle the<br />\nlibrary on its own terms? Remember overhearing conversations held beneath you among<br />\nthe M-Level card catalogs?<br />\nRemember having the Gilman<br />\nclock always in view, keeping<br />\nyou posted on the progress of<br />\nyour day even as you remained<br />\nin a reclining position? All<br />\nthings of the past. Plants in ugly pots supported by casserole<br />\ntins grow wild here now, chained to more of those prison-like<br />\nbars, presenting the possibility<br />\nthat you might poke out an eye<br />\non an upreaching shoot, or trip<br />\non a tentacled floor-creeper and<br />\ntumble over the too-low bars,<br />\nlanding spine first on one of the<br />\ncard catalogs.<br />\nTo be fair, this bit of indoor<br />\nnature can sometimes be pleasing to look at, not to mention<br />\nthe ability it possesses to provide those nearby with fresh<br />\n<br />\noxygen. But you can't sit comfortably on it, at least not until<br />\nit becomes a full arboreum (if<br />\nthat's the University's ultimate<br />\nplan); when the branches are<br />\nthicker, each small tree could<br />\nhold up to three undergrads or<br />\ntwo postgrads with no trouble.<br />\nBut until then, unless you're<br />\ndesperate for a candy bar or<br />\nhave to go into the Garrett<br />\nRoom for something, it's probably best to avoid Q-Level. Its<br />\natmosphere is, sadly, no longer<br />\nconducive to the healthy<br />\nsocializing we all need to get<br />\nthrough the day. And that's<br />\nwhat a college education is all<br />\nabout, isn't it? Well, isn't it?<br />\n<br />\nKing's Birthday Warrants National Holiday<br />\nBY ANITA ROWLAND<br />\n\"The quality, not the<br />\nlongevity, of one's life is what<br />\nis important. It' you are cut<br />\ndown in a movement that is<br />\ndesigned to save the soul of a<br />\nnation, then no other death<br />\ncould be more redemptive.\" As<br />\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,<br />\nspoke these words, he epitomized<br />\nthe spirit and strength<br />\nof his life and of the<br />\ncivil rights movement<br />\nthat he led.

Through the passage of<br />\ncivil rights legislation, race could<br />\nno longer be used to deny a<br />\nperson from enjoying full<br />\nparticipation in American<br />\nsociety. At least this was true in<br />\nprinciple. Dr. King was<br />\nassassinated in 1968, fighting for<br />\nracial equality as a way of life,<br />\nBut some people continue to<br />\nargue that his work does not<br />\nwarrant having his birthday<br />\ndeclared a national holiday They<br />\nargue that it should be the<br />\ndecision of the individual state or<br />\ncity as to whether and how Dr.<br />\nKing's birthday should be<br />\ncelebrated,<br />\nPresently, some cities around<br />\nthe United States do have iheir<br />\ndistinctive celebrations for Dr.<br />\nKing's birthday. Specifically, his<br />\nhometown of Atlanta, Georgia,<br />\ncelebrates with the presentation<br />\nof' the Martin Luther King, Jr.,<br />\nFreedom Medals, the Adult and<br />\n<br />\nYouth Rally, and the Ecumenical<br />\nServices, to mention a few of the<br />\nevents. Numerous celebrities<br />\ncome to town; many recount<br />\ntheir triumphs and disappointments with Dr. King<br />\nduring thc movement. Others<br />\ngive their predictions for the<br />\nfuture of race relations in<br />\nAmerica. And while this is good,<br />\nit must be remembered that Dr.<br />\nKing did not fight just t'or<br />\nAtlanta or the celebrities, he<br />\nfought for all of America and all<br />\nAmericans. If Dr. king had not<br />\nchosen to put himself at the<br />\nforefront of the civil rights<br />\nmovement, the bombings,<br />\nhosings and the riots of the '60s<br />\ncould very well have become the<br />\nbombings and hosings of the<br />\n'70s.

And since the 10 Common Market countries represent 75 percent of the<br />\n.market for seal products, the continuation of the seal<br />\nhunt is threatened.<br />\nBecause of the slim possibility that no seal hunt will<br />\noccur this spring, Greenpeace is actively raising funds<br />\nto support their protest, approximately $225,000. This<br />\nis less than 75 cents for every baby seal now killed<br />\nannually.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10/JANUARY 28, 1983<br />\n<br />\nProcess For Young Trustee Selection Begins<br />\nYoung Trustee Elections<br />\nJanuary 24<br />\n-January 28, 1983<br />\n<br />\nPetitions and biographical information<br />\nforms will be available at Steinwald<br />\nAlumni House, 3211 N.

So Many<br />\nBY GILLIAN F. CLARK<br />\nWilbur Hicks. The name should<br />\nsound familiar to those of you who<br />\nkeep abreast of your game shows.<br />\nThe popularity of Baltimore's Hicks<br />\narises from his appearance on twentyfive consecutive Tic Tac Dough programs and winning over $159,000.<br />\nAired through November, the shows<br />\nmade Hicks a household word and a<br />\nhero for a brief time here in Charm<br />\nCity. For Hicks, it feels good to be<br />\nsuddenly out of the limelight. The<br />\n36-year-old bachelor is an associate<br />\nEnglish professor at the Community College of Baltimore and judicial affairs<br />\nofficer at University of Maryland/Baltimore County. He is still recognized on the street often, and is relieved<br />\nto see the end of the radio and television commercials that featured him<br />\nand increased his already soaring<br />\npopularity.<br />\nThe road to the bittersweet world<br />\nof game show success was not an easy<br />\none. In fact it was almost over before<br />\nit started. Hicks was one of four people selected from five hundred<br />\nfollowing a test of television personality and ability in a contest sponsored by WMAR,\"Baltimore Wins,<br />\n<br />\nGoes Hollywood.\" Hicks made his<br />\nfirst appearance in March, 1982, and<br />\nwon $12,000 before losing. However,<br />\na question Hicks answered correctly<br />\nwas mistakenly marked incorrect and<br />\nhe was invited to reappear in No-<br />\n<br />\nBaltimorean Wilbur Hicks, fully recovered from Wink's winking.<br />\n<br />\nRestaurant Review<br />\n<br />\nC.C., Signor, Jen-erally O.K<br />\nBY SUSIE PARKER<br />\nAND KRISTIN CONRADI<br />\nAs we're sure you've all seen, Jen's<br />\nRestaurant was recently transformed<br />\ninto the C.C., specializing in carryout pizza. Being not only curious and<br />\nadventurous, but also pizza lovers,<br />\nwe decided to continue our neverending quest for better pizza and try it.<br />\nDespite the large sign advertising<br />\npizza, one of the first things we noticed about the C.C. was its snack barlike atmosphere. The restaurant is<br />\nrelatively small and offers a variety<br />\nof grilled fast food, running the<br />\ngamut from breakfast foods (mostly<br />\neggs) to burgers and subs. The prices<br />\nare reasonable, ranging from 60' for<br />\nan egg to $3.40-$4.00 for a large sub.<br />\nHamburgers are 95' and hot dogs are<br />\n75'. Some eye-catching selections are<br />\nthe suki-yaki sub, the shrimp salad<br />\nsub and the crab soup. They also offer Mrs. Smith's cake and pie at 85'<br />\nand 75' a slice, respectively, as well<br />\nas a variety of candy, juices, ice<br />\ncream and even fresh donuts.<br />\nHowever, since our main interest<br />\nwas the pizza, we proceeded to<br />\n<br />\nvember. Given this second chance,<br />\nHicks had no trouble collecting his<br />\nsmall fortune, which he calls, \"time<br />\nconsuming to manage.\"<br />\nAlthough an extensively educated<br />\nman (Hicks earned an A.A. from<br />\n<br />\nchoose from the list featuring tomato<br />\nand cheese($2.90 for a 9-inch pie and<br />\n$4.45 for a 14-inch pie) as well as<br />\nmushroom, pepperoni, green pepper,<br />\nonion, meat sauce and sausage($3.25<br />\nfor a 9-inch pie and $4.75 for a<br />\n14-inch pie). We decided to order a<br />\nlarge pepperoni and a small onion<br />\npigza. The pizza was se..ved. within<br />\ntwenty minutes with refreshing<br />\nfriendliness. We found the pizza to<br />\nbe on par with Dugout pizza,<br />\nalthough the cheese on this pizza has<br />\na more distinctive flavor and is a bit<br />\noilier. The crust is nice and thin<br />\nalthough the one on the small pizza<br />\nwas a bit undercooked. The pepperoni is also exceptionally good.<br />\nAlso available for $7.60 is the C.C.<br />\nspecial, which we learned is the same<br />\npizza with everything on it.<br />\nGenerally, we were really pleased<br />\nwith our latest pizza experience,<br />\nthanks to the immaculate atmosphere, the friendliness, and<br />\nespecially the pizza.<br />\n<br />\nCCB, his bachelor's from Fisk, one<br />\nmaster's degree from Harvard,<br />\nanother from Johns Hopkins and a<br />\nlaw degree from Maryland) he does<br />\nnot attribute his game show success<br />\nto his schooling, but to his avid<br />\nreading. Aside from that accumulation of knowledge, the ability to<br />\nthink logically probably came from<br />\nlaw school. \"Lawyers, as a group,<br />\ntend to do well on the show [TTD]<br />\nsays Hicks. From his collection of<br />\ndegrees it would seem that Hicks was<br />\na professional student. However, that<br />\nis not the case; Hicks does not plan<br />\nto be on the other side of the lecturer's podium for some time. He explains, \"I enjoyed learning and going to school, but I really don't have<br />\nany immediate plans to go back.\"<br />\n<br />\nHicks' winnings were quickly accumulated. He spent only three days<br />\nactually taping the show in California. \"I spent one day in August taping, one day in September, and finally one in October.\" Hicks did not<br />\neven have to take a leave of absence<br />\nfrom his associate professor's position. Seven or eight shows are taped<br />\neach day. For three days' work,<br />\n$159,000 is quite a sum of money.<br />\nNonetheless, Hicks seemed to earn<br />\nevery penny. He was something to<br />\nwatch; very distinguished looking<br />\n(glasses and moustache), he really<br />\nlooked like a college professor or a<br />\nlawyer. He stood tall and confidently at the podium, as at ease as if he<br />\nwere about to lecture or give his closing statements. If he answered a winning question correctly, which he did<br />\nquite often, he would allow himself<br />\na smile and perhaps a little selfacclamation. Hicks was just the boost<br />\nTic Tac Dough needed. He was<br />\nlikeable and he was winning. And if<br />\nany unlikely soul was not charmed by<br />\nHicks' TV personality, he would<br />\nwatch in anticipation of Hicks' game<br />\nshow demise.<br />\n\"The people around me are more<br />\nexcited about this than I am,\" says<br />\nHicks. Of course his family is proud<br />\nand very happy for him. Hicks is<br />\neven stopped on the street and congratulated. If his stay on the show<br />\nwere any longer, it's possible Hicks<br />\nwould have become a cult figure.<br />\nMoreover, there is some significance<br />\nbehind the success of Wilbur Hicks.<br />\nFirstly, as he explains, it certainly<br />\nsays something about lawyers and<br />\ngame shows. \"The big winners on the<br />\nshow, because of their training, are<br />\nusually lawyers.\" Secondly, Hicks<br />\ncontinued, \"I received many letters<br />\nfrom black people who were proud<br />\nthat I had done so well. Many blacks<br />\nidentified with me. Traditionally<br />\nblacks have not done well on the<br />\nshow. I was pleased to show differently, to show that it was possible.\"<br />\n<br />\nC.C.

So I went to<br />\nHarvard, yet even then I wasn't<br />\nsatisfied, so I came to Hopkins, but<br />\nstill I felt my education was incomplete. I had always had an interest in law, so I studied it at<br />\nMaryland and that's where I finished.\"<br />\n<br />\nContrary to popular belief, the<br />\nwinnings have left Hicks' life relatively unchanged. \"I'm not as anxious<br />\nabout money, but my lifestyle is really still the same.\" Popularity has not<br />\nput a drastic dent in Hicks' personality either; his phone number is still<br />\nlisted.<br />\nAlthough it seemed it would never<br />\nhappen, Hicks was finally defeated<br />\nafter 25 appearances on NBC's Tic<br />\n<br />\n\fStudying Abroad<br />\n<br />\nOats!! Israel: Yentas And Young Folk<br />\nTac Dough. \"The loss wasn't painful. I wasn't as sharp because I had<br />\nwon so much and the game was no<br />\nlonger challenging. I had mastered<br />\nthe game and there was nothing more<br />\nto prove,\" Hicks explains.<br />\nFor those of you who missed it, I<br />\nwill recount how Hicks lost. The<br />\nquestion, to me, seemed easy for ol'<br />\nWilbur: \"Who was the female who<br />\nstarred in the NBC series Police<br />\nWoman?\"<br />\nTic, toe, tic, toe\u2014Hicks thought a<br />\nmoment.<br />\n\"Angie Dickerson,\" he answered.<br />\nBuzzzzzzzzzzzz\u2014<br />\n\"I'm sorry Wilbur. Audience, the<br />\ncorrect answer?\"<br />\n\"Angie Dickinson!\" Like a trained chorus.<br />\nSo that was the end for Wilbur<br />\nHicks, short and \"painless.\" One can<br />\nstay on top for so long, and after that<br />\nthe only place to go is down. But<br />\nHicks is still remembered and respected because he proved himself. There<br />\nseemed to be relief in his mien as he<br />\nwalked off the set, not a loser but a<br />\nchampion. Hicks has no plans to appear on any game shows in the immediate future. \"Only if I'm invited<br />\nback to Tic Tac Dough as a previous<br />\nchampion,\" he explains.<br />\nBy law, it will be six months before<br />\nHicks can get his hands on the<br />\nmoney. He has no extravagant plans,<br />\nbut he does have the prizes in his<br />\npossession, including a new car. Remaining unchanged by sudden wealth,<br />\nHicks has not sunken to vice and<br />\ndebauchery although he \"went to<br />\nAtlantic City and blew $200.\" A<br />\nmere bagatelle for Wilbur. Hicks has<br />\nwisely decided to invest the rest of the<br />\nloot.<br />\n<br />\nBY SHARON KOZINN<br />\nIn addition to the SA IS Bologna<br />\nprogram, many opportunities exist<br />\nfor Hopkins students wishing to<br />\nstudy abroad. This week we present<br />\nthe first in a number of pieces<br />\nrecounting the various experiences of<br />\nHopkins students who have left<br />\nHomewoodfor a semester or more to<br />\nstudy overseas.<br />\nJuly 27, 1981.1'm sitting in an aisle seat on El Al flight 010 New YorkTel Aviv. There are about 150 other<br />\nkids who, like me, are on their way<br />\nto the Hebrew University in<br />\nJerusalem One Year Program(OYP)<br />\nfor Overseas Students. I feel sorry for<br />\nthe rest of the passengers, who have<br />\nhad to put up wilth a constant buzz<br />\nof \"Hi. My name is (inaudible<br />\nsound). Who are you? Where do you<br />\ngo to school? Hey, didn't you go to<br />\nCamp Ramah? You were in my bunk<br />\nin 6th grade when we put the salami<br />\nin the counselor's bed. Yeah, I<br />\nremember you.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe plane lands. The captain<br />\nswitches on the music and the whole<br />\nplane starts clapping and cheering.<br />\nPeople start crying, and everyone is<br />\nsuddenly stunned by the realization<br />\nthat after 12 hours of bagels, selfintroductions, and little old ladies<br />\nwho resemble Grandma (\"I have a<br />\ngrandson\u2014Lyou want maybe to see his<br />\npiciure?\"), we have arrived. The<br />\nOYP has begun.<br />\nThe Rot hberg School for Overseas'<br />\nStudents was moved to the Mount<br />\nScopus campus after the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967. Since then,<br />\nthousands of students from all over<br />\nthe U.S.., Canada, Europe, and Latin<br />\nand South- America, have studied in<br />\none of the several programs offered<br />\nfor overseas students. The most<br />\npopular one is the OYP, which for<br />\nthe majority of the students is a.<br />\njunior year abroad, fully accredited<br />\nat most universities. Even Hopkins<br />\ntakes transfer credits, and many<br />\nother top schools are represented<br />\nthere.<br />\nThe program begirs with a Summer Ulpan\u2014an intensive ten week<br />\nHebrew crash course held the summer before the academic year. Ulpan<br />\nis an experience in itself.\u2022 Hundreds<br />\nof people from all over the world participate in order to learn or improve<br />\ntheir command of the Hebrew<br />\nlanguage. Last summer there were<br />\neight subclasses for beginners alone,<br />\nand each of the six levels had between<br />\n6 and 8 sublevels. Everyone learns.<br />\nUlpan runs from Sunday to Thursday, with occasional Friday classes,<br />\nand goes from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. During those 5 hours the teachers(whom<br />\nyou always address by his/her first<br />\nname\u2014things are sort of laid back over<br />\nthere) come up with all kinds ,of<br />\n<br />\neducational diversions. There is a TV<br />\nseries, a listening lab, endless special<br />\nspeakers (who speak at the appropriate level of Hebrew for each<br />\nclass), field trips into the city of<br />\nJerusalem and every Thursday, or<br />\nFriday, if there is a class, a short exam and a party. The afternoons are<br />\nkept free.<br />\nMost OYPers take full advantage<br />\nof their proximity to some of the<br />\nworld's most beautiful sights.<br />\nJerusalem is alive with a unique<br />\nmagic. Faces of a hundred different<br />\ncultures can be seen as one strolls<br />\ndown Jaffa road in the center of<br />\ntown. One is suddenly lurched back<br />\nin time wandering through the Arab<br />\nmarket in the old city\u2014people squabble over the price of everything from<br />\nT-shirts and Cassette's to backgammon boards, water pipes and sheep<br />\nskin coat's. The Church of the Holy<br />\nSepulchre, the Mosque of Omar, and<br />\nthe Western Wall are within a few<br />\nminutes walk of one another.<br />\nJerusalem is an archeologist's dream,<br />\na history buff's paradise, and a<br />\ntourist's haven. The city is packed<br />\nwith restaurants representing the<br />\nmany heritages which make up Israeli<br />\nsociety\u2014Italian, Moroccan, French,<br />\nArgentinian, Russian, Hungarian,<br />\nGreek, and of course there is always<br />\nthe Israeli national food\u2014falafel.<br />\nThe people of Jerusalem are as<br />\ndiverse as the many cultures they<br />\nrepresent, yet they share one overwhelming quality\u2014hospitality. In the<br />\nyear I spent there I stayed in the<br />\ndorms precisely 3 weekends, and<br />\nthose were by choice. Every weekend<br />\nseemed to bring another invitation.<br />\nIf you don't know anyone there when<br />\nyou go, you will by the time you<br />\nleave. Someone down the hall will invite you home, or send you to friends<br />\nor relatives, and before you know it<br />\nyou'll be thinking of hiring someone<br />\nto organize all those scraps of paper<br />\nwith names and phone numbers accompanied by the open invitation,<br />\n\"come anytime.\"<br />\nAlthough one could easily spend a<br />\nlifetime in Jerusalem and never get<br />\nbored, there is much more in Israel<br />\nto see and do. During Ulpan, the<br />\nUniversity sponsors afternoon and<br />\nday trips all over the country. There<br />\nis nothing to stop you from exploring on your own. After Ulpan, there<br />\nis a one-month vacation before the<br />\nacademic year begins. OYPers may<br />\ntake this opportunity to go to Italy,<br />\nGreece or Egypt, or they may stay in<br />\n<br />\nIsrael and travel within the country.<br />\nBus fare is cheap and there are student discounts for almost everything.<br />\nYouth hostels are abundant and it is<br />\nsafe to hitchhike. Since the country<br />\nis so small, you can easily go up<br />\nNorth one day and be down South<br />\nthe next day, or even that evening. In<br />\nthe North, there is the ancient city of<br />\nSafed, the old Phonecian port later<br />\nconCvered by the Crusaders in Acco,<br />\nTiberias along the Sea of Galilee, the<br />\nplush farm lands in the Galil, the<br />\nmodern port city of Haifa, the resort<br />\ntown of Nahariya, the water falls at<br />\nRosh Hanicra, and the majestic<br />\nsplendor of the Golan Heights.<br />\nEverywhere one gos there is plenty<br />\nto see, and the biggest problem is<br />\ndeciding what not to do. One asks<br />\n\"Can I climb Masada, visit the<br />\nsprings at Ein Gedi, float on the Dead<br />\nSea and catch snorkling and a glass<br />\nbottom boat in Eilat, all in one day?\"<br />\nAlas, vacation is soon over and<br />\nschool begins. However, the program<br />\nis designed for students taking a year<br />\nabroad, and offers as many opportunities as possible to explore new<br />\nthings. The classes are taught in<br />\nEnglish, although there are some<br />\ntaught in Hebrew for those who<br />\nprefer, and for those proficient<br />\nenough, regular university courses are<br />\nopen to OYPers. The staff of the<br />\nOYP is made up mostly of Americans<br />\nand Canadians who have moved to<br />\nIsrael, but also includes lsrealis with<br />\na solid command of English. Several<br />\nother nationalities are represented on<br />\nthe staff. The courses offered are<br />\ndiverse and challenging, yet they are<br />\nstructured with the understanding<br />\nthat students want time to explore the<br />\ncountry. Throughout the year trips,<br />\nseminars and social and religious activities are sponsored by the Office of<br />\nStudent Activities(OSA)of' the OYP.<br />\nThere is ample opportunity to get in-volved through the Pipeline Committee (the OYP student council), the<br />\nOYP newspaper, the OYP yearbook,<br />\nor one of the many groups organized by the OSA for the benefit of<br />\noverseas students. All in all, there are<br />\napproximately 500 students from all<br />\nover the US and Canada representing<br />\nhundreds of different universities. In<br />\naddition, the semester program from<br />\nGreat Britian and the preperatory<br />\nyear for Spanish and French speaking students make the School for<br />\nOverseas Students an incredible opportunity to experience different<br />\ncultures while continuing with a<br />\nuniversity education.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem's quad life.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 14/JANUARY 28, 1983<br />\n<br />\nControversy At .11111<br />\n<br />\nCHEESE CO-OP<br />\n<br />\nNADPC Hates JHPIEGO<br />\n<br />\nGood Cheese Cheap!<br />\n<br />\nBY SHARON ASHLEY<br />\nLate last November, the National Democratic Policy Committee, an independent political<br />\naction group, circulated a flier<br />\nat the Northeast Market entitled \"Hitler Is Alive and Well at<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital.\" The<br />\nflier states that Hopkins doctors, under the auspices of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Program for<br />\nInternational Education in<br />\nGynecology and Obstetrics<br />\n(JHPIEGO), with funds from<br />\nthe World Bank and the United<br />\nStates Agency for International<br />\nDevelopment, were \"involved<br />\ndaily in perfecting the efficient<br />\npractice of genocide,\" by performing permanent surgical<br />\nsterilizations on thousands of<br />\nwomen of Third World Nations.<br />\nIn the flier, the NDPC<br />\ndemanded that the so-called<br />\n\"Nazi doctors\" be prohibited<br />\nfrom performing these operations and using tax dollars to do<br />\nso. The group urged people to<br />\ncontact their Congressmen and<br />\nthe Director of JHPIEGO, Ronald Berkman, to tell them that<br />\n\"Nazi doctors are not welcome<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nAs of late December, Charlotte Ellis, spokeswoman for<br />\nJHPIEGO at Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nsaid that there had been very<br />\n<br />\nfew phone calls in response to<br />\nthe flier. When asked what she<br />\nthought of the circular and if<br />\nthere would be any response by<br />\nthe hospital, she said that the<br />\nallegations made by the NDPC<br />\nwould not be dignified by a<br />\nresponse.<br />\nThe NDPC circular states<br />\nthat JHPIEGO is training doctors to implement \"the final<br />\nsolution\u2014permanent surgical<br />\nsterilization\" because traditional methods of contraception have failed to keep in<br />\ncheck the population of Third<br />\nWorld Nations.<br />\nThe flier implies, however,<br />\nthat Hopkins-trained doctors<br />\nare mercilessly sterilizing<br />\nwomen against their will. Further, it implies that the sole purpose of JHPIEGO is to train<br />\ndoctors for this purpose. The<br />\nNDPC states that JHPIEGO<br />\ndoctors are committing acts<br />\n\"for which others were tried at<br />\nNuremberg.\"<br />\nCharlotte Ellis, in a<br />\ntelephone interview, stated that<br />\nthe main purpose of JHPIEGO<br />\nis the education of doctors to<br />\ndeal with the problems of preand post-natal health care, infertility and contraception in<br />\ndeveloping nations.<br />\nJHPIEGO offers training<br />\nprograms for health profes-<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 sionals at Hopkins Hospital<br />\nand overseas.

At the<br />\nheart of Peter Weiss' drama is the ironic<br />\nsimilarity of life under successful revolutionary regimes to life under their ousted<br />\npredecessors. Marat/Sade compares<br />\nNapoleonic France with ancient regime<br />\nFrance, but its effect upon viewing today i< to make one question the wisdom<br />\nbehind the rhetoric of our own political<br />\nleaders. In this respect, it is probably<br />\nmore powerful in 1983 than when it was<br />\nfirst performed in the mid-1960s.<br />\nMarat/Sade made its Hopkins<br />\npremiere last night in association with<br />\nthe Writing Seminars, and plays again<br />\ntonight, tomorrOw and Sunday. For a<br />\n$2 asimission charge ($3 at the door),<br />\none is treated to an ambitious, expansive production which is at once exhiliarating, unsettling and draining.<br />\nMany of the personnel involved with last<br />\nyear's Blossius of Cumae and Rosencram:and Guildenstern are Dead con-<br />\n<br />\ntribute to Marat/Sade, though the<br />\nformer works can now be seen simply<br />\nas preludes to the current production,<br />\nwhich far surpasses them in its attention to detail and sustained energy level.<br />\nGruman, Juhas and company take<br />\nample advantage of the open configuration of the L/V Room,and the audience<br />\nis repeatedly drawn into the drama. The<br />\nunsettling effect of this derives from<br />\nMarat/Sade's setting, a Paris asylum in<br />\n1808. When the inmates/actors disperse<br />\namong the rows of the theater (even<br />\nwhen offering complimentary Gallo<br />\nHearty Burgundy), their strange (read<br />\ninsane) behavior can alternately charm<br />\nand upset. Bring your best humoring instincts to ensure an enjoyable theater<br />\nexperience.<br />\n\u2022 The set, costumes and live musical accompaniment each reflect an all-stopspulled attitude toward production<br />\nvalues, which are the equal of any this<br />\nreviewer has ever seen in an amateur<br />\npresentation. The visual appeal of the<br />\nclothing and set is colorful and accurate.<br />\n<br />\nSingers shown cross-eyed in Alarat/Sade<br />\n<br />\nMusical direction by Joe Levine and<br />\nNancy Galib is commendable, though<br />\nthe full five-piece instrumental complement was not present on the night this<br />\nreviewer saw the play.<br />\nThe driving momentum of Weiss'<br />\ndrama propels it through quick and<br />\noften humorous developments. Within<br />\nthis frenzy, there are performances<br />\nwhich stand out, others which stupefy,<br />\nand some which do both. Andrew<br />\nO'Hehir as Coulmier, keeper of the<br />\nasylum, projects the impenetrable air of<br />\nbureaucratic propriety so suitable to<br />\nNapoleonic gentry, yet cultivated on this<br />\ncontinent only by boarding-school headmasters. O'Hehir's performance also<br />\n<br />\nrts<br />\n<br />\nranks as absolutely the finest Peter<br />\nO'Toole impersonation this reviewer has<br />\never seen.<br />\nWalter Hook once again appears 41S<br />\na bemused sage, this time the Marquis<br />\nde Sade. When Hook speaks, it is in<br />\ndulcet contrast to his counterpart,<br />\nMalcolm Shelley as Jean-Paul Marat,<br />\nwhose impassioned ravings quickly<br />\ndegenerate into strident, stultifying<br />\nmonotony. As the peasants cry out to<br />\nMarat, \"We want our rights/And we<br />\ndon't care how/We want a revolution<br />\nnow!\" his croaking becomes progressively less tolerable, and when Sade<br />\ndebates Marat (confined to \"your bath,<br />\nyour world\")one tends to ignore the opposing substance of their discourse, for<br />\none is too easily distracted by the contrasting deliveries.<br />\nGenerally the action of the drama is<br />\ngroup-oriented, and the brisk choreography is so overwhelming as to minimize the impact of individual performances. This is to the credit of the entire directorial staff. Several lesser roles<br />\nstand out nonetheless.

After he<br />\nleft Miles, however, Herbie became<br />\nremarkably uneven, alternating between<br />\nspectacular jazz albums and some of the<br />\nmost wretched disco-funk imaginable.<br />\nHis new album on Columbia, The Herbie Hancock Quartet, shows that Herbie is still an all-star pianist. Recorded<br />\nin Japan (the Japanese don't stand for<br />\nthe garbage we do), it reunites Hancock<br />\nwith the rest of the old Davis rhythm<br />\nsection:'bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams. They are a superb<br />\nteam. Carter's majestically deep, driving bass lines allow Williams a lot of<br />\nrhythmic freedom, while Herbie's right<br />\nhand produces airy cascades of notes.<br />\nThey also swing like hell.<br />\nInto this mix is thrown the boy<br />\nwonder of jazz, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who at age 21 (21!) has become<br />\none of the top jazzmen around. An<br />\nunknown in 1979, Marsalis swept the<br />\n1982 Downbeat magazine readers' poll:<br />\nMusician of the Year, Album of the<br />\nYear (his debut, Wynton Marsalis) and<br />\nBest Trumpeter.

After<br />\nwinning only two of their first<br />\ntwelve games, both victories<br />\ncoming against Gallaudet, the<br />\nteam was 2-2 in the last four<br />\ngames. And, importantly, their<br />\nrecord stands at 2-1 in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast. The Blue Jays'<br />\noverall record of 4-12 is somewhat misleading, as four of the<br />\nlosses were suffered at the<br />\nhands of tough Division 1 opponents. Still, the season must<br />\n<br />\ncenter Bob Clayton. This made<br />\nit even more difficult for the<br />\nJays to control Pharmacy's<br />\npowerful front line, though<br />\nHopkins put forth a good effort, with Kuame Workman<br />\ndoing a commendable job<br />\nreplacing Clayton.

Neither<br />\nteam played exceptionally well,<br />\nand the Hopkins victory can be<br />\nattributed greatly to the Jays'<br />\nsuperior foul shooting. While<br />\nthe Haverford squad missed<br />\nmany one and one opportunities, Hopkins was able to hit<br />\ndown the stretch and maintain<br />\ntheir lead. The star of Hopkins'<br />\n69-61 victory was sophomore<br />\nKen Puhala, who made key<br />\nsteals and hit 13 straight foul<br />\nshots in the final part of the<br />\ngame.<br />\n<br />\nHuh Nilson pra)s tor a \u2018iclor.<br />\n<br />\nTuesday, the Jays faced Messiah College in a home game.<br />\nAfter a close first half, Messiah<br />\npulled out to a 12-point lead.<br />\nHopkins pulled within two as<br />\nless than two minutes remained, but after an obvious offensive foul on Messiah was not<br />\ncalled, Messiah was able to convert on a number of opportunities and Messiah came away<br />\nwith a 69-61 victory.<br />\nIn what has essentially been<br />\na tough season for the .lays thus<br />\nfar, there have been some stand<br />\nout performers.

To<br />\nsuch lacrosse powerhouses as<br />\n<br />\nNorth Carolina, Princeton,<br />\nUMBC and, of course,<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWhen Scott was named athletic director in 1973, he chose<br />\nCiccarone to succeed him as<br />\nhead coach. Ciccarone played<br />\n<br />\nCurrent .lay head lacrosse coach, Henry Ciccarone, as Hopkins gridder.<br />\n<br />\nNorth Carolina and Virginia,<br />\nHopkins means rivalry and<br />\nsomething else\u2014coaches. Both<br />\nschools are coached by<br />\nHopkins lacrosse alumni. But it<br />\ndoes not stop there. The<br />\nHopkins lacrosse program has<br />\nflooded the collegiate lacrosse<br />\nscene with outstanding coaches.<br />\nWhat is it that makes coaches<br />\nfrom Hopkins so good? Hopkins Athletic Director Bob<br />\nScott believes that \"the key to<br />\nsuccess is the great tradition<br />\nhere which draws so many<br />\ntalented people into the program.\" Head Coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone describes the Blue<br />\nJay program as \"one of excellence, where the players are<br />\ngiven a thorough knowledge of<br />\nlacrosse through outstanding<br />\ncoaching.\" Ciccarone attributes success in coaching to<br />\n\"having the knowledge and being able to convey it.\" Since<br />\nHopkins attracts high-caliber<br />\nplayers, they can translate success on the playing field into<br />\nsuccessful Coaching.<br />\nHere at Hopkins, upwards of<br />\n95 percent of all coaches have<br />\nbeen Hopkins graduates. According to Scott, \"They were<br />\nselected for excellence and not<br />\nfor playing here.\" The present<br />\ncoaching tradition dates back to<br />\nScott's playing days. He was an<br />\nhonorable mention all-American in 1952, and is regarded as<br />\nthe authority on lacrosse.<br />\nBeginning in 1954, he coached<br />\nfor 20 years and led Hopkins to<br />\nseven national championships.<br />\nHe coached 42 players to first<br />\nteam all-American positions.<br />\nSeveral players under Scott now<br />\npilot lacrosse programs at<br />\n<br />\nunder Scott and was a threetime all-American, in addition<br />\nto being an outstanding football player. He was captain of<br />\nboth the lacrosse and football<br />\nteams. He was also an assistant<br />\ncoach for Scott. From his<br />\nknowledge of \"Chic's\" leadershi both as a \u2022layer and as a<br />\n<br />\nBob<br />\n<br />\ncolt in<br />\n<br />\niS p y g<br />\n<br />\nays.<br />\n<br />\ncoach, Scott picked him to take<br />\nover the lacrosse team. \"I knew<br />\nthat Chic was the best person<br />\naround and would be outstanding,\" Scott explained. In his<br />\neight years as head man, Ciccarone has coached Hopkins to<br />\nthree national championships,<br />\nfour second-place finishes, and<br />\none third-place finish. He was<br />\nnamed 1981 Coach of the Year.<br />\nClearly, Ciccarone's playing<br />\nskills carried over into coaching.<br />\nCiccarone has surrounded<br />\nhimself with the best assistants;<br />\nall Hopkins grads. He has two<br />\nfull-time assistants, Don Zimmerman and Jerry Pfeifer. Zim<br />\nmerman is the recently-added<br />\nnumber two man, described as<br />\n\"the best around\" by Scott.<br />\nZimmerman will work with the<br />\n3ffense. As a player, Pfeifer<br />\nwas an all-American attackman<br />\nfor three years, in addition to<br />\nquarterbacking the football<br />\nteam. Presently he is also the<br />\nhead football coach. Pfeifer<br />\nworks with the goalkeepers and<br />\noverall defense.<br />\nThere are also four part-time<br />\nassistants. Dennis Townsend, a<br />\n'65 grad who played on the<br />\nUSA world team, works with<br />\nattackmen and close defense.<br />\nThree-time all-American Joe<br />\nCowan, considered the best<br />\nlacrosse player of his generation, concentrates on close attack and extra-man defense.<br />\nFred Smith has been either a<br />\nscout or assistant since 1954,<br />\nand is responsible for close and<br />\nextra-man defense. Howdy<br />\nNicklaus, a 1980 graduate, was<br />\nan assistant iv coach, and is<br />\nnow the junior varsity's head<br />\ncoach.<br />\nCiccarone believes much of<br />\nHopkins' success is due to the<br />\nquality of his assistant coaches.<br />\n\"A coach is only as good as<br />\nthose with whom he is surrounded,\" he claims. Also,<br />\n\"It's a lot easier to have a person who has been through our<br />\nsystem become an assistant<br />\ncoach.\" Since the coaches have<br />\npassed through the same system, \"they have similar lines of<br />\nthinking. Each has his own personality, and they complement<br />\neach other. All are leaders.\"<br />\nThese factors add up to a successful coaching situation.<br />\nHopkins lacrosse graduates<br />\nare also responsible for the success of many of the Blue Jays'<br />\nrivals. The most success, in recent years, has been enjoyed by<br />\nthe University of North Carolina. The Tarheels, coached by<br />\n1969 Hopkins graduate Willie<br />\nScroggs, have beaten Johns<br />\nHopkins in the NCAA Division<br />\nI championship game the last<br />\ntwo years. Scroggs played<br />\nlacrosse at Hopkins from 1967<br />\nto 1969, under Scott. After<br />\ngraduation, he returned to<br />\nHopkins as an assistant coach.<br />\nIn 1978, after five years as a<br />\nBlue Jay assistant, he left<br />\nBaltimore to take over the<br />\nNorth Carolina program. In<br />\njust four years, he has turned<br />\nCarolina into a lacrosse power.<br />\nThe University of Virginia<br />\nWahoos are led by 1950 Hopkins graduate Ace Adams.<br />\n<br />\nAdams, along with Scott, played under Howdy Myers. Adams'<br />\nsuccessful coaching career<br />\nbegan at West Point and led to<br />\nfour University Division championships during an eight-year<br />\ntenure. After leaving West<br />\n<br />\nDick Watts, a 1956 graduate,<br />\nis both director of athletics and<br />\nhead lacrosse coach at UMBC.<br />\nUMBC obtained Division I<br />\nstanding just last year, and<br />\nWatts led them through a successful season that ended in<br />\n<br />\nAssistant coach Ciccarone and head coach Scott inspire 1964 taxman.<br />\n<br />\nPoint, Adams spent four years<br />\ncoaching at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania. In 1977, Adams<br />\ntook command of the Virginia<br />\nprogram, which has become a<br />\nperennial title contender.<br />\n<br />\nPfeifer as Jay QB.<br />\n<br />\nClass of '62 graduate Jerry<br />\nSchmidt now coaches at Princeton. A teammate of Ciccarone's,<br />\nSchmidt previously led Hobart<br />\nto three Division III championships.<br />\n<br />\nconsideration for the Division<br />\nI post-season tournament. As a<br />\nDivision II school, UMBC captured a championship, also<br />\nunder Watts. Scott describes<br />\nWatts as \"doing an excellent<br />\njob with the UMBC program.\"<br />\nMost recently, 1979 graduate<br />\nDave Huntley and 1982 graduate Dave Black joined the<br />\nLoyola College lacrosse program as assistant coaches.<br />\nHuntley was a first team allAmerican midfielder and Black<br />\na second team defenseman.<br />\nEach year Hopkins competes<br />\nagainst teams coached by<br />\nformer Blue Jays. Thus, there<br />\nexists the potential for heightened intensity during play. According to Ciccarone, this is<br />\nparticularly evident when the<br />\nJays take on North Carolina.<br />\n\"Now that we've lost to<br />\nScroggs twice, you could say<br />\nit's getting more intense.\"<br />\n<br />\nNorth Carolina head coach Willie Scroggs and Hopkins assistant<br />\ncoach Joe Cowan played football as well as lacrosse at JHU.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 22/JANUARY 28, 1983<br />\n<br />\nHost Susquehanna tomorrow<br />\n<br />\nWrestlers Pin Down 3-2 Intersession Record<br />\nBY HOWARD BREGMAN<br />\nAfter most Hopkins students<br />\nwere finished grappling with<br />\ntheir final exams, the varsity<br />\nwrestling team continued to hit<br />\nthe mats through Intersession in<br />\ndaily practices and four tough<br />\nmatches. The 16-man team, led<br />\nby third-year Coach John Fred<br />\nKohler, succeeded in scoring<br />\ntwo MAC victories while also<br />\ngaining needed experience against stronger Division I<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe grapplers were trounced<br />\nby powerful Div. 1 American<br />\nUniversity, 42-3. According to<br />\nKohler,\"There are some teams<br />\nyou just know you aren't going<br />\nto beat,\" and playing better<br />\nteams i the best way to improve one's skills. The Jays<br />\nshowed this with a win last<br />\nSaturday at home against<br />\nHaverford by a 43-12 score,<br />\nbringing their Intersession<br />\nrecord to 3-2. Previous victories<br />\ncame against Frederick Community College and Loyola,<br />\nwhile the team lost to Western<br />\nMaryland. Two losses to<br />\nGeorge Washington and Howard occurred early in the<br />\nseason.<br />\nContributing much to the<br />\nJays' effort so far have been cocaptains Chester Wagstaff at<br />\n142 and Joel Eichler at 158, as<br />\nwell as Paul DiMuzio and Rick<br />\nGrohl at 150 and 167, respectively.

The proposal is expected<br />\nto be made official in a few<br />\nweeks, at which time it will be<br />\nopen to criticism, suggestions<br />\nand comments for 30 days.<br />\nSusan Broadbent, director of<br />\nfinancial aid at Hopkins, feels<br />\nthat the regulation \"is discriminating against needy students\"<br />\nbecause a student who does not<br />\nneed financial aid will not be<br />\naffected by the regulation<br />\nwhether he has registered or<br />\nnot. It will only enforce registration for those who need<br />\nfederal financial aid. Broadbent<br />\nsaid,\"I am hoping [the regulation] disappears and goes<br />\naway,\" not only because of its<br />\ndiscriminatory nature, but because it would cause \"an adsministrative nightmare.\"<br />\nIf the proposal becomes law<br />\nthe Financial Aid Office will<br /><br />\ncomply because Broadbent cannot put the University at odds<br />\nwith the law unless the trustees<br />\nexplicitely state that the institution cannot follow the new<br />\nlegislation. The office will<br />\ncheck and make sure that students eligible for financial aid<br />\nhave registered and the students<br />\nwill be asked to produce a copy<br />\nof the letter from the selective<br />\nservice acknowledging their<br />\nregistration.<br />\n\u2022 Financial Aid will request<br />\nnon-registered students to sign<br />\na questionnaire stating their<br />\nreasons for not registering. At<br />\nthis point, Broadbent does not<br />\nknow what will happen to the<br />\nnon-registered students who<br />\nwill be denied federal aid. She<br />\nfeels that the regulation will be<br />\n\"an additional unnecessary<br />\nburden on financial aid\" and<br />\nshe disapproves of using universities as \"an arm of the law.\"<br />\nThis opinion is shared by<br />\nmany students at Hopkins.<br />\nHousemaster Jeff Martin said,<br />\n\"The two programs should be<br />\ncompletely separate, and stucont. on p. 3<br /><br />\n...<br /><br />\nBecause of a lack of patrons, the Rat will be closed on Frida and Saturda) nights.<br /><br />\nRathskeller Will Close Weekends<br />\nAs Students Avoid Campus Pub<br />\nBY ANDREW HURLEY<br />\nAND<br />\nMIKE VOGELBAUM<br />\nThe Rathskellar will be closed on Friday and Saturday<br />\nnights starting this semester.<br />\nThe reduced operation of the<br />\nRat is in response to the lack of<br />\nattendence on the two nights.<br />\nAccording to Bettye Miller,<br />\nDirector of Auxiallary Enterprises, only one or two persons<br /><br />\nCity Fails To Close Traffic Lane<br />\nBy January Date As Anticipated<br />\nBY MARIANNE PERRELLA<br />\nContrary to expectations,<br />\nthe single southbound lane<br />\non North Charles Street has<br />\nnot yet been closed to traffic. While the plan for lane<br />\nclosure has been approved<br />\nby Hopkins administration,<br />\nthe Charles Village Association and the Baltimore<br />\nDepartment of Transit and<br />\nTraffic, progress on the problem appears to be nonexistent.<br />\nIn a meeting with Student<br />\nCouncil members last July,<br />\nPaul Burns, city traffic<br />\nengineer,<br />\nmentioned<br />\nJanuary of this year as a<br />\npossible project completion<br />\ndate. \"This was a very tentative estimate,\" Burns now<br />\nasserts. \"There's a lot involved in a lane closure.'<br />\nThe process involves<br />\nvarious city procedures.

This equipment will consist of internally illuminated signs flashing<br />\na message which will divert<br />\ntraffic into the isolated<br /><br />\nwent to the Rat each Friday and<br />\nSaturday nights. She added that<br />\nthe attendence had been declining for theipast four years, but<br />\nthis year it hit \"rock bottom.\"<br />\nIn an attempt to determine<br />\nwhy the attendence was declining, an ad hoc Rathskellar<br />\nReview Committee was formed. The committee included six<br />\nstudents and Associate Dean of<br />\nStudents, Chris Colombo, who<br />\nworked as a resource person.<br />\nTwo of the problems that the<br />\ncommittee cited are the preference of students to go off<br />\ncampus on weekends, and the<br />\n\"cold\" interior design of the<br />\nRat. The lack of popular musical groups, due to the prohibitive cost of such attractions,<br /><br />\nblamed for the decline.<br />\nBased on these problems, the<br />\ncommittee published a set of<br />\nrecommendations. Although it<br />\nrecommended the closing of the<br />\nRat as it is organized now on<br />\nFriday and Saturday nights, the<br />\ncommittee suggested that the<br />\nopportunity for weekend programming be open to the general student body. The Union<br />\nBoard will help coordinate any<br />\nentertainment suggested and<br />\nplanned by students.

Other plans call for the<br />\naddition of endowed faculty<br />\nchairs at SAIS and the establish<br />\nment of more student scholarships. A committee of SAIS<br />\nfaculty members, alumni and<br />\nadministrators drafted these<br />\nplans during a two-year period<br />\nin 1979-80. The committee did<br />\nnot conceive specific plans, but<br /><br />\nrather attempted to identify<br />\nareas of future concern for<br />\nSAIS. Once funds are secured,<br />\nmore detailed plans will become<br />\navailable, according to Crowell.<br />\nThe building addition will<br />\nreceive first priority, said<br />\nCrowell. He indicated that<br />\nmost of the addition will be occupied by the library. The remaining space will become avail<br />\nable for student-use areas.

An ad-hoc committee, which studied possible<br />\nuses for the dining area after a<br />\nnew dining hall is opened next<br />\nyear, recommended that four<br />\nrooms be created. The plan<br />\ndoes not call for any breaking<br />\nor building of walls.

Among<br />\nthese are the effort to give students a broader<br />\nbased education and securing assurance that<br />\nundergraduates will no longer have to be<br />\nsubjected to teaching assistants with poor<br />\ncommunicative skills.<br />\nThe TA issue is an old one and at the end<br />\nof last semester finally was brought to the<br />\nattention of the Academic Council. In urging the departments to remedy this problem,<br />\nthe Council made a positive move, if only<br />\nby recognizing that a problem existed.<br />\nHowever, the Academic Council tabled a<br />\nsensible CUS amendment which would have<br />\nbarred questionable first year graduate<br />\nstudents from acting as teaching assistants.<br />\nThrowing the problem to the departments<br />\nis not an efficient solution because a lack of<br />\nuniformity is bound to arise. In the absence<br />\nof further Academic Council action on this<br />\nmatter, it is essential that the deans take an<br />\nactive role in setting and enforcing guidelines<br />\nfor the departments. There is no excuse for<br />\nthe TA issue to remain unresolved by the end<br />\nof this 'semester.<br /><br />\nThe effort to secure a liberal arts education for undergraduates is a newer concern,<br />\nbut in the long run, much more important<br />\nthan the TA issue. Last semester witnessed<br />\nthe first steps in achieving this goal. We<br />\nshould expect more substantive gains in the<br />\ncoming semester. Specific proposals must be<br />\nworked out among students, administrators,<br />\nand faculty. If none of these groups take the<br />\ninitiative to move ahead on this issue, it<br />\nwould be appropriate for President Muller,<br />\nwho favors such curriculum changes, to step<br />\nin and get the ball rolling.<br />\nThere is a third issue that we have heard<br />\nlittle about last semester but is bound to be<br />\nthe center of controversy in the coming<br />\nsemester. This is the issue of an alcohol<br />\npolicy. By the time next years freshmen class<br />\nenters Hopkins, those students who will not<br />\nbe legally allowed to drink will approach the<br />\nfifty percent mark. In the next few months<br />\nhard decisions will have to be made about<br />\nenforcing the law, serving liquor and campus social events, and resuscitating a lagging<br />\ncampus social climate.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Ain't A Cop<br />\nEven putting aside the debate over the<br />\nmerits of compulsory draft registration, the<br />\ncurrent proposal to deny federal financial aid<br />\nto male students who fail to register should<br />\nbe opposed. The major objection to the proposal is that it blatantly diceriminates against<br />\nneedy students. Those students who do not<br />\nrequire aid will remain unaffected. The proposal also warps the main principle behind<br />\nfinancial aid: to equalize educational opportunity for Americans of all classes. Under<br />\nthis proposal, patriotism would become a requisite for access to educational opportunities. Finally, the regulation would force<br />\nuniversities to take on the role of policemen.<br />\nIf the federal government is intent on enforcing draft registration it should bear the<br />\nresponsibilities and financial burdens.<br />\nThe issue of financial aid and draft<br />\nregistration was brought up briefly before<br />\nthe Student Council at Wednesday night's<br />\nmeeting. In the Council's recent tradition of<br /><br />\navoiding involvement in politics, they chose<br />\nnot to consider taking a stand on the issue.<br />\nWhile keeping away from hot political issues<br />\nis often prudent, in this case it is repulsive.<br />\nIt is one thing to resist endorsing a presidential candidate in a national election; it is quite<br />\nanother to ignore issues, such as financial<br />\naid, that strike at the heart of student concerns. The Student Council's attitude reflects<br />\ntimidity and irresponsibility. Refusing to<br />\neven consider taking a stand just because the<br />\nissue is \"political\" is completely absurd.<br />\nThe Student Council's unwillingness to<br />\nstand by student's interests on this issue does<br />\nnot preclude the administration from doing<br />\nso. Administration and faculties of several<br />\nuniversities have publicly complained about<br />\nthe policy.

We<br />\nwere fortunate to have a teacher native to the language area<br />\nstudied, and to be in the<br />\npresence of a remarkable person. Her famous tiara is now a<br />\ncrown of laurel.<br />\nStories and anecdotes illuminate her legendary and real<br />\nhistory. When she was emigrating from Russia, early, in the<br />\ncentury, all her baggage and<br />\nworldly goods were lost or<br />\nstolen, a material loss she<br />\nstoically shrugged off. Arriving<br />\nat customs in the port of entry,<br />\nshe literally had nothing to<br />\ndeclare but her genius, wit, zest<br />\nand culture.<br />\nBut Dr. Keefer always rose<br />\nabove what she regarded as the<br />\nmerely personal, domestic and<br />\nlogistical superfluities of existence. Her main interests were<br />\npurely impersonal, the great<br />\nthings of the mind and spirit,<br /><br />\nthough she would disdain this<br />\npanegyric writing about her, if<br />\nindeed she would even deign to<br />\nread it in her new abode among<br />\nthe eternal stars and the music<br />\nof the spheres.<br />\nMu-sic was her forte. She was<br />\na pianist, also professor of<br />\nmusic appreciation at the Hopkins and the Peabody Conservatory. Her book Music Angels<br />\n(1976) covers a thousand years<br />\nof patronage of music by women. She herself was a patroness, an angel of music.<br />\nThis aristocratic lady was<br />\nalso a prime mover of a Russian<br />\nCulture Society that met monthly in the Garrett Room of the<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library,<br />\nor in her salon on Tudor Arms<br />\nAvenue.<br />\nAs said above, she would<br />\nbrush aside eulogy and ecomia,<br />\nif she could overhear them<br />\nnow\u2014and I suspect she can\u2014<br />\nand so no conventional litany is<br />\noffered here.

Is this any<br />\nway to relax?<br />\nNow cast your thoughts back<br />\nward. Remember the sunlight<br />\nthat used to flood in on you<br />\nwhen the sofas were in front of<br />\nthe doors? Remember the ruddy, determined faces of the<br />\npeople as they entered, fresh<br />\nfrom reality, ready to tackle the<br />\nlibrary on its own terms? Remember overhearing conversations held beneath you among<br />\nthe M-Level card catalogs?<br />\nRemember having the Gilman<br />\nclock always in view, keeping<br />\nyou posted on the progress of<br />\nyour day even as you remained<br />\nin a reclining position? All<br />\nthings of the past. Plants in ugly pots supported by casserole<br />\ntins grow wild here now, chained to more of those prison-like<br />\nbars, presenting the possibility<br />\nthat you might poke out an eye<br />\non an upreaching shoot, or trip<br />\non a tentacled floor-creeper and<br />\ntumble over the too-low bars,<br />\nlanding spine first on one of the<br />\ncard catalogs.<br />\nTo be fair, this bit of indoor<br />\nnature can sometimes be pleasing to look at, not to mention<br />\nthe ability it possesses to provide those nearby with fresh<br /><br />\noxygen. But you can't sit comfortably on it, at least not until<br />\nit becomes a full arboreum (if<br />\nthat's the University's ultimate<br />\nplan); when the branches are<br />\nthicker, each small tree could<br />\nhold up to three undergrads or<br />\ntwo postgrads with no trouble.<br />\nBut until then, unless you're<br />\ndesperate for a candy bar or<br />\nhave to go into the Garrett<br />\nRoom for something, it's probably best to avoid Q-Level. Its<br />\natmosphere is, sadly, no longer<br />\nconducive to the healthy<br />\nsocializing we all need to get<br />\nthrough the day. And that's<br />\nwhat a college education is all<br />\nabout, isn't it? Well, isn't it?<br /><br />\nKing's Birthday Warrants National Holiday<br />\nBY ANITA ROWLAND<br />\n\"The quality, not the<br />\nlongevity, of one's life is what<br />\nis important. It' you are cut<br />\ndown in a movement that is<br />\ndesigned to save the soul of a<br />\nnation, then no other death<br />\ncould be more redemptive.\" As<br />\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,<br />\nspoke these words, he epitomized<br />\nthe spirit and strength<br />\nof his life and of the<br />\ncivil rights movement<br />\nthat he led. The<br />\npurpose of this article<br />\nis not to recount the<br />\nsit-ins,<br />\nmarches,<br />\njailing, beatings or any<br />\nof the other events of<br />\nthe movement. (Any<br />\ngood history book<br />\nshould be able to do<br />\nthat.) Instead, it is in<br />\nof the<br />\nsupport<br />\nlegislation that has<br />\nbeen introduced to<br />\nmake Dr. King's<br />\nbirthday, January 15,<br />\na national holiday.<br /><br />\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,<br />\nled a civil rights movement that<br />\nwas designed to raise an<br />\nawareness in the American<br />\nconsciousness to the paradox between this country's ideals of<br />\nfreedom and democracy and the<br />\nreality of second-class citizenship<br />\ngranted to some of her people.<br />\nDr. King's \"war\" against<br />\nsegregation and discrimination<br /><br />\nAll News-Letter Staffers:<br />\nThere will be a MANDATORY meeting for<br />\nall News-Letter staff members(everyone whose<br />\nname appears in the box) on Saturday,<br />\nJanuary 29, 1983 at 3 p.m. at the News-Letter<br />\noffice. We will discuss plans for the coming<br />\nsemester and confirm some editorial positions.<br /><br />\ntransformed the personality of<br />\nAmerica's treatment of the race<br />\nproblem. Through the passage of<br />\ncivil rights legislation, race could<br />\nno longer be used to deny a<br />\nperson from enjoying full<br />\nparticipation in American<br />\nsociety. At least this was true in<br />\nprinciple. Dr. King was<br />\nassassinated in 1968, fighting for<br />\nracial equality as a way of life,<br />\nBut some people continue to<br />\nargue that his work does not<br />\nwarrant having his birthday<br />\ndeclared a national holiday They<br />\nargue that it should be the<br />\ndecision of the individual state or<br />\ncity as to whether and how Dr.<br />\nKing's birthday should be<br />\ncelebrated,<br />\nPresently, some cities around<br />\nthe United States do have iheir<br />\ndistinctive celebrations for Dr.<br />\nKing's birthday. Specifically, his<br />\nhometown of Atlanta, Georgia,<br />\ncelebrates with the presentation<br />\nof' the Martin Luther King, Jr.,<br />\nFreedom Medals, the Adult and<br /><br />\nYouth Rally, and the Ecumenical<br />\nServices, to mention a few of the<br />\nevents. Numerous celebrities<br />\ncome to town; many recount<br />\ntheir triumphs and disappointments with Dr. King<br />\nduring thc movement. Others<br />\ngive their predictions for the<br />\nfuture of race relations in<br />\nAmerica. And while this is good,<br />\nit must be remembered that Dr.<br />\nKing did not fight just t'or<br />\nAtlanta or the celebrities, he<br />\nfought for all of America and all<br />\nAmericans. If Dr. king had not<br />\nchosen to put himself at the<br />\nforefront of the civil rights<br />\nmovement, the bombings,<br />\nhosings and the riots of the '60s<br />\ncould very well have become the<br />\nbombings and hosings of the<br />\n'70s. Have America and her<br />\npeople forgotten the movement?<br />\nThe Dream? Is it too much to<br />\nask her to remember?

Morris agreed with<br />\nFellman on the importance of<br />\nthe committee issue, but also<br />\nadded the council's campaign<br />\nagainst adoption and the NewsLetter's editorial advocating a<br />\nno vote as key issues.<br />\nFellman, however, disputed<br />\nthe importance of the council's<br />\ncampaign.<br />\n\"I don't think the campaign<br />\nwaged by council was particularly good or particularly<br />\neffective,\" Fellman said. \"We<br />\nwere not that organized, and we<br />\ndidn't spend nearly as much<br />\nmoney as they did.\"<br />\nIn a fiercly waged campaign,<br />\nthe two sides frequently accused each other of lying.<br />\nAlthough Morris submitted<br />\nthe petition for the proposed<br />\nconstitution, the council referred to it, verbally and in its<br />\ncampaign posters, as the \"Lally Constitution.\" Fellman said<br />\nthe council did this because Lally was the \"driving force\"<br />\nbehind the new constitution.<br />\n\"I know Grant went aroung<br />\ngetting signatures for the petition because he asked me to<br />\nsign it,\" Fellman said. \"He was<br />\nthe driving force behind it... If<br /><br />\nthey want to put someone else's<br />\nname on it, that's their<br />\nprerogative,\" Fellman added,<br />\n\"but he shouldn't be ashamed<br />\nof his name.\"<br />\nLally told the News-Letter<br />\nthat to refer to the constitution<br />\nas the \"Lally Constitution\"<br />\nwas \"grossly inaccurate.\" He<br />\nalso denied being the \"driving<br />\nforce\" behind the document.<br />\nAsked why he thinks the<br />\ncouncil used his name, Lally<br />\nsaid, \"[the council] perceived<br />\nthere was political advantage to<br />\nbe gained by doing it.\"<br />\nMorris agreed. \"I think they<br />\ndid it because Grant is a controversial person with a controversial personality. It was<br />\nsomething for the council<br />\nmembers to rally around; they<br />\ncould all go out and attack<br />\nGrant Lally.\"<br />\nMorris said Lally was one of<br />\nabout 12 authors, though he<br />\ndescribed Lally as a \"major<br />\ncontributor.\" '<br />\nWhile Fellman said he plans<br />\nno formal action in response to<br />\nthe election, he said he would<br />\nbe interested in hearing any<br />\ncomplaints<br />\nabout<br />\nthe<br />\nconstitution.<br />\n\"If the people who have concerns would like to put together<br />\nsome sort of list of recommendations and bring them to<br />\ncouncil,\" he said, \"I would be<br />\ninterested in hearing them.\"<br /><br />\nTenure Survey<br />\ncont. from p. 2<br />\n\"The key question,\" according to Fellman, was \"In your<br />\nopinion, how will/did your<br />\nteaching<br />\ninfluence<br />\nthe<br />\nAcademic Council's decision<br />\nregarding your promotion or<br />\ntenure?\" The AC publishes<br />\nrules on tenure each year, and<br />\nFellman says the rules divide<br />\nthe importance of teaching and<br />\nresearch equally. Almost none<br />\nof the responses, however,<br />\nviewed these as equal, and most<br />\nsaid that their teaching had<br />\nbeen considered \"very little\" or<br />\n\"not at all.\" Some respondents<br />\nargued that classroom teaching<br />\nis not the only form of<br />\nteaching; that publishing is just<br /><br />\nas good. Fellman states,<br />\nhowever, that if this were true,<br />\n\"We could all go to mail-order<br />\ncolleges... We are here to<br />\ninteract.\"<br />\nThe last question\u2014\"Can undergraduates play a role in<br />\nevaluating teaching for promotion or tenure decisions? If so,<br />\nhow?\"\u2014evoked the longest<br />\nanswers; the responses were the<br />\nmost individual, and the faculty \"really expressed itself,\" said<br />\nFellman. They<br />\nshowed<br />\nthemselves to be concerned<br />\nwith how students formed their<br />\nopinions.

In 1978, the Greenpeace<br />\ntook two Congressmen onto the ice, and a Greenpeace<br />\nmember was arrested for protecting seals with his<br />\nbody. In 1979, Greenpeace volunteers chained them-,<br />\nselves to sealing ships. In 1980, Greenpeace volunteers<br />\ndyed seals green. In 1981, Greenpeace members, along<br />\nwith citizens of Prince Edward Island, organized a protest to ban the hunt from the island.

So Many<br />\nBY GILLIAN F. CLARK<br />\nWilbur Hicks. The name should<br />\nsound familiar to those of you who<br />\nkeep abreast of your game shows.<br />\nThe popularity of Baltimore's Hicks<br />\narises from his appearance on twentyfive consecutive Tic Tac Dough programs and winning over $159,000.<br />\nAired through November, the shows<br />\nmade Hicks a household word and a<br />\nhero for a brief time here in Charm<br />\nCity. For Hicks, it feels good to be<br />\nsuddenly out of the limelight. The<br />\n36-year-old bachelor is an associate<br />\nEnglish professor at the Community College of Baltimore and judicial affairs<br />\nofficer at University of Maryland/Baltimore County. He is still recognized on the street often, and is relieved<br />\nto see the end of the radio and television commercials that featured him<br />\nand increased his already soaring<br />\npopularity.<br />\nThe road to the bittersweet world<br />\nof game show success was not an easy<br />\none. In fact it was almost over before<br />\nit started. Hicks was one of four people selected from five hundred<br />\nfollowing a test of television personality and ability in a contest sponsored by WMAR,\"Baltimore Wins,<br /><br />\nGoes Hollywood.\" Hicks made his<br />\nfirst appearance in March, 1982, and<br />\nwon $12,000 before losing. However,<br />\na question Hicks answered correctly<br />\nwas mistakenly marked incorrect and<br />\nhe was invited to reappear in No-<br /><br />\nBaltimorean Wilbur Hicks, fully recovered from Wink's winking.<br /><br />\nRestaurant Review<br /><br />\nC.C., Signor, Jen-erally O.K<br />\nBY SUSIE PARKER<br />\nAND KRISTIN CONRADI<br />\nAs we're sure you've all seen, Jen's<br />\nRestaurant was recently transformed<br />\ninto the C.C., specializing in carryout pizza. Being not only curious and<br />\nadventurous, but also pizza lovers,<br />\nwe decided to continue our neverending quest for better pizza and try it.<br />\nDespite the large sign advertising<br />\npizza, one of the first things we noticed about the C.C. was its snack barlike atmosphere. The restaurant is<br />\nrelatively small and offers a variety<br />\nof grilled fast food, running the<br />\ngamut from breakfast foods (mostly<br />\neggs) to burgers and subs. The prices<br />\nare reasonable, ranging from 60' for<br />\nan egg to $3.40-$4.00 for a large sub.<br />\nHamburgers are 95' and hot dogs are<br />\n75'. Some eye-catching selections are<br />\nthe suki-yaki sub, the shrimp salad<br />\nsub and the crab soup. They also offer Mrs. Smith's cake and pie at 85'<br />\nand 75' a slice, respectively, as well<br />\nas a variety of candy, juices, ice<br />\ncream and even fresh donuts.<br />\nHowever, since our main interest<br />\nwas the pizza, we proceeded to<br /><br />\nvember. Given this second chance,<br />\nHicks had no trouble collecting his<br />\nsmall fortune, which he calls, \"time<br />\nconsuming to manage.\"<br />\nAlthough an extensively educated<br />\nman (Hicks earned an A.A. from<br /><br />\nchoose from the list featuring tomato<br />\nand cheese($2.90 for a 9-inch pie and<br />\n$4.45 for a 14-inch pie) as well as<br />\nmushroom, pepperoni, green pepper,<br />\nonion, meat sauce and sausage($3.25<br />\nfor a 9-inch pie and $4.75 for a<br />\n14-inch pie). We decided to order a<br />\nlarge pepperoni and a small onion<br />\npigza. The pizza was se..ved. within<br />\ntwenty minutes with refreshing<br />\nfriendliness. We found the pizza to<br />\nbe on par with Dugout pizza,<br />\nalthough the cheese on this pizza has<br />\na more distinctive flavor and is a bit<br />\noilier. The crust is nice and thin<br />\nalthough the one on the small pizza<br />\nwas a bit undercooked. The pepperoni is also exceptionally good.<br />\nAlso available for $7.60 is the C.C.<br />\nspecial, which we learned is the same<br />\npizza with everything on it.<br />\nGenerally, we were really pleased<br />\nwith our latest pizza experience,<br />\nthanks to the immaculate atmosphere, the friendliness, and<br />\nespecially the pizza.<br /><br />\nCCB, his bachelor's from Fisk, one<br />\nmaster's degree from Harvard,<br />\nanother from Johns Hopkins and a<br />\nlaw degree from Maryland) he does<br />\nnot attribute his game show success<br />\nto his schooling, but to his avid<br />\nreading. Aside from that accumulation of knowledge, the ability to<br />\nthink logically probably came from<br />\nlaw school. \"Lawyers, as a group,<br />\ntend to do well on the show [TTD]<br />\nsays Hicks. From his collection of<br />\ndegrees it would seem that Hicks was<br />\na professional student. However, that<br />\nis not the case; Hicks does not plan<br />\nto be on the other side of the lecturer's podium for some time. He explains, \"I enjoyed learning and going to school, but I really don't have<br />\nany immediate plans to go back.\"<br /><br />\nHicks' winnings were quickly accumulated. He spent only three days<br />\nactually taping the show in California. \"I spent one day in August taping, one day in September, and finally one in October.\" Hicks did not<br />\neven have to take a leave of absence<br />\nfrom his associate professor's position. Seven or eight shows are taped<br />\neach day. For three days' work,<br />\n$159,000 is quite a sum of money.<br />\nNonetheless, Hicks seemed to earn<br />\nevery penny. He was something to<br />\nwatch; very distinguished looking<br />\n(glasses and moustache), he really<br />\nlooked like a college professor or a<br />\nlawyer. He stood tall and confidently at the podium, as at ease as if he<br />\nwere about to lecture or give his closing statements. If he answered a winning question correctly, which he did<br />\nquite often, he would allow himself<br />\na smile and perhaps a little selfacclamation. Hicks was just the boost<br />\nTic Tac Dough needed. He was<br />\nlikeable and he was winning. And if<br />\nany unlikely soul was not charmed by<br />\nHicks' TV personality, he would<br />\nwatch in anticipation of Hicks' game<br />\nshow demise.<br />\n\"The people around me are more<br />\nexcited about this than I am,\" says<br />\nHicks. Of course his family is proud<br />\nand very happy for him. Hicks is<br />\neven stopped on the street and congratulated. If his stay on the show<br />\nwere any longer, it's possible Hicks<br />\nwould have become a cult figure.<br />\nMoreover, there is some significance<br />\nbehind the success of Wilbur Hicks.<br />\nFirstly, as he explains, it certainly<br />\nsays something about lawyers and<br />\ngame shows. \"The big winners on the<br />\nshow, because of their training, are<br />\nusually lawyers.\" Secondly, Hicks<br />\ncontinued, \"I received many letters<br />\nfrom black people who were proud<br />\nthat I had done so well. Many blacks<br />\nidentified with me. Traditionally<br />\nblacks have not done well on the<br />\nshow. I was pleased to show differently, to show that it was possible.\"<br /><br />\nC.C.

So I went to<br />\nHarvard, yet even then I wasn't<br />\nsatisfied, so I came to Hopkins, but<br />\nstill I felt my education was incomplete. I had always had an interest in law, so I studied it at<br />\nMaryland and that's where I finished.\"<br /><br />\nContrary to popular belief, the<br />\nwinnings have left Hicks' life relatively unchanged. \"I'm not as anxious<br />\nabout money, but my lifestyle is really still the same.\" Popularity has not<br />\nput a drastic dent in Hicks' personality either; his phone number is still<br />\nlisted.<br />\nAlthough it seemed it would never<br />\nhappen, Hicks was finally defeated<br />\nafter 25 appearances on NBC's Tic<br /><br />\nStudying Abroad<br /><br />\nOats!! Israel: Yentas And Young Folk<br />\nTac Dough. \"The loss wasn't painful. I wasn't as sharp because I had<br />\nwon so much and the game was no<br />\nlonger challenging. I had mastered<br />\nthe game and there was nothing more<br />\nto prove,\" Hicks explains.<br />\nFor those of you who missed it, I<br />\nwill recount how Hicks lost. The<br />\nquestion, to me, seemed easy for ol'<br />\nWilbur: \"Who was the female who<br />\nstarred in the NBC series Police<br />\nWoman?\"<br />\nTic, toe, tic, toe\u2014Hicks thought a<br />\nmoment.<br />\n\"Angie Dickerson,\" he answered.<br />\nBuzzzzzzzzzzzz\u2014<br />\n\"I'm sorry Wilbur. Audience, the<br />\ncorrect answer?\"<br />\n\"Angie Dickinson!\" Like a trained chorus.<br />\nSo that was the end for Wilbur<br />\nHicks, short and \"painless.\" One can<br />\nstay on top for so long, and after that<br />\nthe only place to go is down. But<br />\nHicks is still remembered and respected because he proved himself. There<br />\nseemed to be relief in his mien as he<br />\nwalked off the set, not a loser but a<br />\nchampion. Hicks has no plans to appear on any game shows in the immediate future. \"Only if I'm invited<br />\nback to Tic Tac Dough as a previous<br />\nchampion,\" he explains.<br />\nBy law, it will be six months before<br />\nHicks can get his hands on the<br />\nmoney. He has no extravagant plans,<br />\nbut he does have the prizes in his<br />\npossession, including a new car. Remaining unchanged by sudden wealth,<br />\nHicks has not sunken to vice and<br />\ndebauchery although he \"went to<br />\nAtlantic City and blew $200.\" A<br />\nmere bagatelle for Wilbur. Hicks has<br />\nwisely decided to invest the rest of the<br />\nloot.<br /><br />\nBY SHARON KOZINN<br />\nIn addition to the SA IS Bologna<br />\nprogram, many opportunities exist<br />\nfor Hopkins students wishing to<br />\nstudy abroad.

The most<br />\npopular one is the OYP, which for<br />\nthe majority of the students is a.<br />\njunior year abroad, fully accredited<br />\nat most universities.

There is a TV<br />\nseries, a listening lab, endless special<br />\nspeakers (who speak at the appropriate level of Hebrew for each<br />\nclass), field trips into the city of<br />\nJerusalem and every Thursday, or<br />\nFriday, if there is a class, a short exam and a party.

The city is packed<br />\nwith restaurants representing the<br />\nmany heritages which make up Israeli<br />\nsociety\u2014Italian, Moroccan, French,<br />\nArgentinian, Russian, Hungarian,<br />\nGreek, and of course there is always<br />\nthe Israeli national food\u2014falafel.<br />\nThe people of Jerusalem are as<br />\ndiverse as the many cultures they<br />\nrepresent, yet they share one overwhelming quality\u2014hospitality.

During Ulpan, the<br />\nUniversity sponsors afternoon and<br />\nday trips all over the country. There<br />\nis nothing to stop you from exploring on your own. After Ulpan, there<br />\nis a one-month vacation before the<br />\nacademic year begins. OYPers may<br />\ntake this opportunity to go to Italy,<br />\nGreece or Egypt, or they may stay in<br /><br />\nIsrael and travel within the country.<br />\nBus fare is cheap and there are student discounts for almost everything.<br />\nYouth hostels are abundant and it is<br />\nsafe to hitchhike. Since the country<br />\nis so small, you can easily go up<br />\nNorth one day and be down South<br />\nthe next day, or even that evening. In<br />\nthe North, there is the ancient city of<br />\nSafed, the old Phonecian port later<br />\nconCvered by the Crusaders in Acco,<br />\nTiberias along the Sea of Galilee, the<br />\nplush farm lands in the Galil, the<br />\nmodern port city of Haifa, the resort<br />\ntown of Nahariya, the water falls at<br />\nRosh Hanicra, and the majestic<br />\nsplendor of the Golan Heights.<br />\nEverywhere one gos there is plenty<br />\nto see, and the biggest problem is<br />\ndeciding what not to do.

However, the program<br />\nis designed for students taking a year<br />\nabroad, and offers as many opportunities as possible to explore new<br />\nthings. The classes are taught in<br />\nEnglish, although there are some<br />\ntaught in Hebrew for those who<br />\nprefer, and for those proficient<br />\nenough, regular university courses are<br />\nopen to OYPers. The staff of the<br />\nOYP is made up mostly of Americans<br />\nand Canadians who have moved to<br />\nIsrael, but also includes lsrealis with<br />\na solid command of English. Several<br />\nother nationalities are represented on<br />\nthe staff. The courses offered are<br />\ndiverse and challenging, yet they are<br />\nstructured with the understanding<br />\nthat students want time to explore the<br />\ncountry. Throughout the year trips,<br />\nseminars and social and religious activities are sponsored by the Office of<br />\nStudent Activities(OSA)of' the OYP.<br />\nThere is ample opportunity to get in-volved through the Pipeline Committee (the OYP student council), the<br />\nOYP newspaper, the OYP yearbook,<br />\nor one of the many groups organized by the OSA for the benefit of<br />\noverseas students. All in all, there are<br />\napproximately 500 students from all<br />\nover the US and Canada representing<br />\nhundreds of different universities. In<br />\naddition, the semester program from<br />\nGreat Britian and the preperatory<br />\nyear for Spanish and French speaking students make the School for<br />\nOverseas Students an incredible opportunity to experience different<br />\ncultures while continuing with a<br />\nuniversity education.<br /><br />\nThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem's quad life.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nPAGE 14/JANUARY 28, 1983<br /><br />\nControversy At .11111<br /><br />\nCHEESE CO-OP<br /><br />\nNADPC Hates JHPIEGO<br /><br />\nGood Cheese Cheap!<br /><br />\nBY SHARON ASHLEY<br />\nLate last November, the National Democratic Policy Committee, an independent political<br />\naction group, circulated a flier<br />\nat the Northeast Market entitled \"Hitler Is Alive and Well at<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital.\" The<br />\nflier states that Hopkins doctors, under the auspices of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Program for<br />\nInternational Education in<br />\nGynecology and Obstetrics<br />\n(JHPIEGO), with funds from<br />\nthe World Bank and the United<br />\nStates Agency for International<br />\nDevelopment, were \"involved<br />\ndaily in perfecting the efficient<br />\npractice of genocide,\" by performing permanent surgical<br />\nsterilizations on thousands of<br />\nwomen of Third World Nations.<br />\nIn the flier, the NDPC<br />\ndemanded that the so-called<br />\n\"Nazi doctors\" be prohibited<br />\nfrom performing these operations and using tax dollars to do<br />\nso. The group urged people to<br />\ncontact their Congressmen and<br />\nthe Director of JHPIEGO, Ronald Berkman, to tell them that<br />\n\"Nazi doctors are not welcome<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nAs of late December, Charlotte Ellis, spokeswoman for<br />\nJHPIEGO at Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nsaid that there had been very<br /><br />\nfew phone calls in response to<br />\nthe flier. When asked what she<br />\nthought of the circular and if<br />\nthere would be any response by<br />\nthe hospital, she said that the<br />\nallegations made by the NDPC<br />\nwould not be dignified by a<br />\nresponse.<br />\nThe NDPC circular states<br />\nthat JHPIEGO is training doctors to implement \"the final<br />\nsolution\u2014permanent surgical<br />\nsterilization\" because traditional methods of contraception have failed to keep in<br />\ncheck the population of Third<br />\nWorld Nations.<br />\nThe flier implies, however,<br />\nthat Hopkins-trained doctors<br />\nare mercilessly sterilizing<br />\nwomen against their will. Further, it implies that the sole purpose of JHPIEGO is to train<br />\ndoctors for this purpose. The<br />\nNDPC states that JHPIEGO<br />\ndoctors are committing acts<br />\n\"for which others were tried at<br />\nNuremberg.\"<br />\nCharlotte Ellis, in a<br />\ntelephone interview, stated that<br />\nthe main purpose of JHPIEGO<br />\nis the education of doctors to<br />\ndeal with the problems of preand post-natal health care, infertility and contraception in<br />\ndeveloping nations.<br />\nJHPIEGO offers training<br />\nprograms for health profes-<br /><br />\n\u2022 sionals at Hopkins Hospital<br />\nand overseas.

At the<br />\nheart of Peter Weiss' drama is the ironic<br />\nsimilarity of life under successful revolutionary regimes to life under their ousted<br />\npredecessors. Marat/Sade compares<br />\nNapoleonic France with ancient regime<br />\nFrance, but its effect upon viewing today i&lt; to make one question the wisdom<br />\nbehind the rhetoric of our own political<br />\nleaders. In this respect, it is probably<br />\nmore powerful in 1983 than when it was<br />\nfirst performed in the mid-1960s.<br />\nMarat/Sade made its Hopkins<br />\npremiere last night in association with<br />\nthe Writing Seminars, and plays again<br />\ntonight, tomorrOw and Sunday. For a<br />\n$2 asimission charge ($3 at the door),<br />\none is treated to an ambitious, expansive production which is at once exhiliarating, unsettling and draining.<br />\nMany of the personnel involved with last<br />\nyear's Blossius of Cumae and Rosencram:and Guildenstern are Dead con-<br /><br />\ntribute to Marat/Sade, though the<br />\nformer works can now be seen simply<br />\nas preludes to the current production,<br />\nwhich far surpasses them in its attention to detail and sustained energy level.<br />\nGruman, Juhas and company take<br />\nample advantage of the open configuration of the L/V Room,and the audience<br />\nis repeatedly drawn into the drama. The<br />\nunsettling effect of this derives from<br />\nMarat/Sade's setting, a Paris asylum in<br />\n1808. When the inmates/actors disperse<br />\namong the rows of the theater (even<br />\nwhen offering complimentary Gallo<br />\nHearty Burgundy), their strange (read<br />\ninsane) behavior can alternately charm<br />\nand upset. Bring your best humoring instincts to ensure an enjoyable theater<br />\nexperience.<br />\n\u2022 The set, costumes and live musical accompaniment each reflect an all-stopspulled attitude toward production<br />\nvalues, which are the equal of any this<br />\nreviewer has ever seen in an amateur<br />\npresentation. The visual appeal of the<br />\nclothing and set is colorful and accurate.<br /><br />\nSingers shown cross-eyed in Alarat/Sade<br /><br />\nMusical direction by Joe Levine and<br />\nNancy Galib is commendable, though<br />\nthe full five-piece instrumental complement was not present on the night this<br />\nreviewer saw the play.<br />\nThe driving momentum of Weiss'<br />\ndrama propels it through quick and<br />\noften humorous developments. Within<br />\nthis frenzy, there are performances<br />\nwhich stand out, others which stupefy,<br />\nand some which do both. Andrew<br />\nO'Hehir as Coulmier, keeper of the<br />\nasylum, projects the impenetrable air of<br />\nbureaucratic propriety so suitable to<br />\nNapoleonic gentry, yet cultivated on this<br />\ncontinent only by boarding-school headmasters. O'Hehir's performance also<br /><br />\nrts<br /><br />\nranks as absolutely the finest Peter<br />\nO'Toole impersonation this reviewer has<br />\never seen.<br />\nWalter Hook once again appears 41S<br />\na bemused sage, this time the Marquis<br />\nde Sade. When Hook speaks, it is in<br />\ndulcet contrast to his counterpart,<br />\nMalcolm Shelley as Jean-Paul Marat,<br />\nwhose impassioned ravings quickly<br />\ndegenerate into strident, stultifying<br />\nmonotony. As the peasants cry out to<br />\nMarat, \"We want our rights/And we<br />\ndon't care how/We want a revolution<br />\nnow!\" his croaking becomes progressively less tolerable, and when Sade<br />\ndebates Marat (confined to \"your bath,<br />\nyour world\")one tends to ignore the opposing substance of their discourse, for<br />\none is too easily distracted by the contrasting deliveries.<br />\nGenerally the action of the drama is<br />\ngroup-oriented, and the brisk choreography is so overwhelming as to minimize the impact of individual performances. This is to the credit of the entire directorial staff. Several lesser roles<br />\nstand out nonetheless.

After he<br />\nleft Miles, however, Herbie became<br />\nremarkably uneven, alternating between<br />\nspectacular jazz albums and some of the<br />\nmost wretched disco-funk imaginable.<br />\nHis new album on Columbia, The Herbie Hancock Quartet, shows that Herbie is still an all-star pianist. Recorded<br />\nin Japan (the Japanese don't stand for<br />\nthe garbage we do), it reunites Hancock<br />\nwith the rest of the old Davis rhythm<br />\nsection:'bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams. They are a superb<br />\nteam.

And, importantly, their<br />\nrecord stands at 2-1 in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast. The Blue Jays'<br />\noverall record of 4-12 is somewhat misleading, as four of the<br />\nlosses were suffered at the<br />\nhands of tough Division 1 opponents. Still, the season must<br /><br />\ncenter Bob Clayton.

To<br />\nsuch lacrosse powerhouses as<br /><br />\nNorth Carolina, Princeton,<br />\nUMBC and, of course,<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWhen Scott was named athletic director in 1973, he chose<br />\nCiccarone to succeed him as<br />\nhead coach.

The<br />\nHopkins lacrosse program has<br />\nflooded the collegiate lacrosse<br />\nscene with outstanding coaches.<br />\nWhat is it that makes coaches<br />\nfrom Hopkins so good? Hopkins Athletic Director Bob<br />\nScott believes that \"the key to<br />\nsuccess is the great tradition<br />\nhere which draws so many<br />\ntalented people into the program.\" Head Coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone describes the Blue<br />\nJay program as \"one of excellence, where the players are<br />\ngiven a thorough knowledge of<br />\nlacrosse through outstanding<br />\ncoaching.\" Ciccarone attributes success in coaching to<br />\n\"having the knowledge and being able to convey it.\" Since<br />\nHopkins attracts high-caliber<br />\nplayers, they can translate success on the playing field into<br />\nsuccessful Coaching.<br />\nHere at Hopkins, upwards of<br />\n95 percent of all coaches have<br />\nbeen Hopkins graduates. According to Scott, \"They were<br />\nselected for excellence and not<br />\nfor playing here.\" The present<br />\ncoaching tradition dates back to<br />\nScott's playing days. He was an<br />\nhonorable mention all-American in 1952, and is regarded as<br />\nthe authority on lacrosse.<br />\nBeginning in 1954, he coached<br />\nfor 20 years and led Hopkins to<br />\nseven national championships.<br />\nHe coached 42 players to first<br />\nteam all-American positions.<br />\nSeveral players under Scott now<br />\npilot lacrosse programs at<br /><br />\nunder Scott and was a threetime all-American, in addition<br />\nto being an outstanding football player. He was captain of<br />\nboth the lacrosse and football<br />\nteams. He was also an assistant<br />\ncoach for Scott. From his<br />\nknowledge of \"Chic's\" leadershi both as a \u2022layer and as a<br /><br />\nBob<br /><br />\ncolt in<br /><br />\niS p y g<br /><br />\nays.<br /><br />\ncoach, Scott picked him to take<br />\nover the lacrosse team. \"I knew<br />\nthat Chic was the best person<br />\naround and would be outstanding,\" Scott explained. In his<br />\neight years as head man, Ciccarone has coached Hopkins to<br />\nthree national championships,<br />\nfour second-place finishes, and<br />\none third-place finish. He was<br />\nnamed 1981 Coach of the Year.<br />\nClearly, Ciccarone's playing<br />\nskills carried over into coaching.<br />\nCiccarone has surrounded<br />\nhimself with the best assistants;<br />\nall Hopkins grads. He has two<br />\nfull-time assistants, Don Zimmerman and Jerry Pfeifer. Zim<br />\nmerman is the recently-added<br />\nnumber two man, described as<br />\n\"the best around\" by Scott.<br />\nZimmerman will work with the<br />\n3ffense. As a player, Pfeifer<br />\nwas an all-American attackman<br />\nfor three years, in addition to<br />\nquarterbacking the football<br />\nteam. Presently he is also the<br />\nhead football coach. Pfeifer<br />\nworks with the goalkeepers and<br />\noverall defense.<br />\nThere are also four part-time<br />\nassistants. Dennis Townsend, a<br />\n'65 grad who played on the<br />\nUSA world team, works with<br />\nattackmen and close defense.<br />\nThree-time all-American Joe<br />\nCowan, considered the best<br />\nlacrosse player of his generation, concentrates on close attack and extra-man defense.<br />\nFred Smith has been either a<br />\nscout or assistant since 1954,<br />\nand is responsible for close and<br />\nextra-man defense. Howdy<br />\nNicklaus, a 1980 graduate, was<br />\nan assistant iv coach, and is<br />\nnow the junior varsity's head<br />\ncoach.<br />\nCiccarone believes much of<br />\nHopkins' success is due to the<br />\nquality of his assistant coaches.<br />\n\"A coach is only as good as<br />\nthose with whom he is surrounded,\" he claims. Also,<br />\n\"It's a lot easier to have a person who has been through our<br />\nsystem become an assistant<br />\ncoach.\" Since the coaches have<br />\npassed through the same system, \"they have similar lines of<br />\nthinking. Each has his own personality, and they complement<br />\neach other. All are leaders.\"<br />\nThese factors add up to a successful coaching situation.<br />\nHopkins lacrosse graduates<br />\nare also responsible for the success of many of the Blue Jays'<br />\nrivals. The most success, in recent years, has been enjoyed by<br />\nthe University of North Carolina. The Tarheels, coached by<br />\n1969 Hopkins graduate Willie<br />\nScroggs, have beaten Johns<br />\nHopkins in the NCAA Division<br />\nI championship game the last<br />\ntwo years. Scroggs played<br />\nlacrosse at Hopkins from 1967<br />\nto 1969, under Scott. After<br />\ngraduation, he returned to<br />\nHopkins as an assistant coach.<br />\nIn 1978, after five years as a<br />\nBlue Jay assistant, he left<br />\nBaltimore to take over the<br />\nNorth Carolina program. In<br />\njust four years, he has turned<br />\nCarolina into a lacrosse power.<br />\nThe University of Virginia<br />\nWahoos are led by 1950 Hopkins graduate Ace Adams.<br /><br />\nAdams, along with Scott, played under Howdy Myers. Adams'<br />\nsuccessful coaching career<br />\nbegan at West Point and led to<br />\nfour University Division championships during an eight-year<br />\ntenure. After leaving West<br /><br />\nDick Watts, a 1956 graduate,<br />\nis both director of athletics and<br />\nhead lacrosse coach at UMBC.<br />\nUMBC obtained Division I<br />\nstanding just last year, and<br />\nWatts led them through a successful season that ended in<br /><br />\nAssistant coach Ciccarone and head coach Scott inspire 1964 taxman.<br /><br />\nPoint, Adams spent four years<br />\ncoaching at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania. In 1977, Adams<br />\ntook command of the Virginia<br />\nprogram, which has become a<br />\nperennial title contender.<br /><br />\nPfeifer as Jay QB.<br /><br />\nClass of '62 graduate Jerry<br />\nSchmidt now coaches at Princeton. A teammate of Ciccarone's,<br />\nSchmidt previously led Hobart<br />\nto three Division III championships.<br /><br />\nconsideration for the Division<br />\nI post-season tournament. As a<br />\nDivision II school, UMBC captured a championship, also<br />\nunder Watts. Scott describes<br />\nWatts as \"doing an excellent<br />\njob with the UMBC program.\"<br />\nMost recently, 1979 graduate<br />\nDave Huntley and 1982 graduate Dave Black joined the<br />\nLoyola College lacrosse program as assistant coaches.<br />\nHuntley was a first team allAmerican midfielder and Black<br />\na second team defenseman.<br />\nEach year Hopkins competes<br />\nagainst teams coached by<br />\nformer Blue Jays. Thus, there<br />\nexists the potential for heightened intensity during play. According to Ciccarone, this is<br />\nparticularly evident when the<br />\nJays take on North Carolina.<br />\n\"Now that we've lost to<br />\nScroggs twice, you could say<br />\nit's getting more intense.\"<br /><br />\nNorth Carolina head coach Willie Scroggs and Hopkins assistant<br />\ncoach Joe Cowan played football as well as lacrosse at JHU.<br /><br />\nPAGE 22/JANUARY 28, 1983<br /><br />\nHost Susquehanna tomorrow<br /><br />\nWrestlers Pin Down 3-2 Intersession Record<br />\nBY HOWARD BREGMAN<br />\nAfter most Hopkins students<br />\nwere finished grappling with<br />\ntheir final exams, the varsity<br />\nwrestling team continued to hit<br />\nthe mats through Intersession in<br />\ndaily practices and four tough<br />\nmatches. The 16-man team, led<br />\nby third-year Coach John Fred<br />\nKohler, succeeded in scoring<br />\ntwo MAC victories while also<br />\ngaining needed experience against stronger Division I<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe grapplers were trounced<br />\nby powerful Div. 1 American<br />\nUniversity, 42-3. According to<br />\nKohler,\"There are some teams<br />\nyou just know you aren't going<br />\nto beat,\" and playing better<br />\nteams i the best way to improve one's skills. The Jays<br />\nshowed this with a win last<br />\nSaturday at home against<br />\nHaverford by a 43-12 score,<br />\nbringing their Intersession<br />\nrecord to 3-2. Previous victories<br />\ncame against Frederick Community College and Loyola,<br />\nwhile the team lost to Western<br />\nMaryland. Two losses to<br />\nGeorge Washington and Howard occurred early in the<br />\nseason.<br />\nContributing much to the<br />\nJays' effort so far have been cocaptains Chester Wagstaff at<br />\n142 and Joel Eichler at 158, as<br />\nwell as Paul DiMuzio and Rick<br />\nGrohl at 150 and 167, respectively. Kohler points to them as<br /><br />\nthe most consistent competitors that the guys on our team<br />\nThis season culminates at the chance to test themselves<br />\nfor this season.
