Dr. Eisenhower responded<br />\nto a 415 signature petition presented to him at the<br />\nmeeting by three Hopkins freshmen. Plant manager of<br />\nthe University Wesley Taylor, in whose department<br />\nthe food service belongs, will conduct the investigation.<br />\nThe petition, which was organized by freshmen Bob<br />\nGayle, Richard Hammond, Bruce McLeish and Mark<br />\nOlman, asked for an investigation of the \"inferior<br />\nquality of the food,\" because \"the apparent lack of<br />\n.quality constitutes a serious detriment to our health<br />\nand morale.\" Included in the copies of the petition<br />\npresented to the administration were more specific<br />\ncomplaints such as the small size and quality of the<br />\nmeat, the lack of proteins in the diet, the greasiness of<br />\nthe meat, the shortage of garden vegetables and fresh<br />\nfruits, and the cleaning of the silver and glassware.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower expressed a deep concern for the<br />\nsituation in the cafeteria and promised action. Ham-.<br />\nmond, Olman, Gayle, and Taylor will meet next Tues.<br />\nday at 10:00 A.M. to further discuss the situation.<br />\nLaShaw Concerned<br />\nMr. Howard LaShaw, director of the food service,<br />\nalso expressed concern over the students' complaints.<br /><br />\nREEXAMINED<br />\nThe director stated that he would personally prepare<br />\nthe menus for the dormitory and that \"I'll be there<br />\nphysically nine-tenths of the day. I will be right there<br />\nfor all meals, observing the cooking.\" Mr. LaShaw<br />\nhoped to be able to talk to students during the meals<br />\nIn order to hear specific complaints. \"I'll very definitely<br />\nbe up there from here on out,\" he repeated. \"We do<br />\nwant suggestions. The door is open every meal and<br />\nplease stop by with any suggestions at all. We will be<br />\nmore than glad to listen to them and put them into<br />\neffect. The fellows live here nine months out of the<br />\nyear and we certainly want to try to keep thent<br />\nhappy.\"<br />\nIn addition to personally supervising the dormitory<br />\ncafeteria, LaShaw is surveying the menu's from the<br />\npast years to see if there really is lack of protein in the<br />\nplanned diet. He also explained that the service only<br />\nbuys top quality meats and other foods.<br />\nGov't Stamped<br />\nAll canned foods bear a certificate of quality and<br />\ncondition from the U.S. Department of Agriculture<br />\nwhich checks that the cans meet the specifications.<br />\nThe service only buys top grade, U.S. Choice- or U.S.<br />\nGood meat The government classifies meat as prime,<br />\nchoice, good, and commercial in order of quality.<br />\nLa Shaw emphasized that he was very interested in<br />\nspecific complaints such as greasy food, and that<br />\nthese would be acted upon promptly. He was puzzled<br />\nover what was different this year than other years<br />\nthat the students should think that the food had become exceptionally bad. \"The cooks are the same<br />\npeople, the procedure the same, the meat quality is<br />\nthe same.\"<br />\nStudent Views<br />\nStudent opinion in the dormitories seemed to agree<br />\nwith the tone of the petition. Toby Simon, a senior,<br />\nstated that \"the extremely bad quality of the dormitory food seems to be part of the general policy of<br />\nletting the dormitory facilities decay and becoming<br />\nless desirable to live in.
