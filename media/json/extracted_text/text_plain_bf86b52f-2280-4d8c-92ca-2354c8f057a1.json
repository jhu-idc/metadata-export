The<br />\nintroduction the The Humanities<br />\nbrochure elaborates: \"(Daniel<br />\nCoit) Gilman managed to capture<br />\nthe essence of the European<br />\neducation system with its<br />\nemphasis on academic freedom,<br />\ngraduate study, and research, and<br />\nto translate it to the American<br />\nscene. In doing so he won a place<br />\nfor higher learning in a culture<br />\nthat until that time had rejected<br />\nthe theoretical and nad been<br />\nbasically indifferent to.<br />\nfundamental research.\" It<br />\ncontinues, \"You may wonder<br />\nwhat the key is to this unusuali<br />\nHopkins system....How it has<br />\nmanaged to remain a place where<br />\na good deal of the education that<br />\ngoes on stems from the \u2022<br />\nstudents\u2014both undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate\u2014motivating each other?<br />\nThe answer to this question says<br />\na lot about the kind of place<br />\nHopkins is.\" Unfortunately, the<br />\nbulletin seems to have missed a<br />\nmore important question: Why is<br />\nthis university hierarchy<br />\nstructured, in a way that<br />\ndiscourages<br />\nundergraduate-graduate<br />\nrelations?<br />\n\"Department walls are very<br />\nPermeable,\" a faculty member<br />\nremarks in .The Humanities<br />\nbulletin. An English grad student<br />\ndisagrees. \"The graduate<br />\nstudents, in general, don't freely<br />\nassociate with each other, so why<br />\nshould they be expected to<br />\nassociate with the<br />\nundergraduates?\" -Every grad<br />\n<br />\nstudent interviewed mentioned<br />\nacademic and social<br />\n\"compartmentalization\" among<br />\ndepartments. For example, an<br />\nArt History grad student feels<br />\nfamiliar with only \"a part of the<br />\nschool, in that I know graduate<br />\nstudents in the humanities.. I<br />\nknow no science grad students.\"<br />\nA Romance Languages grad<br />\nstudent admits that it is \"easy to<br />\ndepartmentalize yourself...Even<br />\nwithin Romance Languages,<br />\n[students of a particular<br />\nlanguage] stick to themselves.\"<br />\nSmall seminars and independent<br />\nresearch separate graduate<br />\nstudents from each other and<br />\nalso from the undergraduates.<br />\n\"We're really two student<br />\nbodies,\" an Art History grad<br />\nstudent says.

It's<br />\njust impossible!\" But some<br />\ndepartments are structured to<br />\nfacilitate graduate-undergraduate<br />\ninteraction. \"I don't think there's<br />\na -.big gap between graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students,\"<br />\nHumanities Center grad student<br />\nremarks. \"A graduate student has<br />\na piece of paper. But Humanities<br />\nis the exception to the rule,\" he<br />\nadmits. Also, History grad<br />\nstudents mix with<br />\nundergraduates in some classes.<br />\nAlthough 300-level courses are<br />\nnot required as part of his<br />\ncurriculum, one History grad<br />\n<br />\nstudent audited a course last<br />\nsemester to gain competence in<br />\nantebellum American studies.<br />\nCurrently, 15% of the students<br />\nenrolled in 300-level courses are<br />\ngraduate students; 10% of<br />\n600-level students are<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nThe most common way that<br />\nundergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents share knowledge is<br />\n1:s<br />\nthrough conferences, at which<br />\nthe grad students act as teaching c3<br />\nassistants. Many graduate<br />\nI Chris Tomlins<br />\nstudents gain their, only contact<br />\nwith undergraduates through<br />\nbeing TA's. Student experiences<br />\nwith TA's vary greatly.

Ah, in<br />\nspring a youngster's fancy turns to thoughts of<br />\nlove and politics; while some may see one as a<br />\nstepping stone to the other, matters of the heart<br />\nand of the government do not mix. To be a<br />\nconsummate<br />\nthough<br />\nnot consummated)<br />\npolitician one has to be ruthless, tough,<br />\nambitious, egotistical, arrogant, fanatical,<br />\ndogmatic, and pragmtic. Just take a look at Stu<br />\nDavidson. If one is looking for a little<br />\nhubba-hubba, the Hopkins student government,<br />\nat any level, is not the place to begin the search.<br />\nIn its own ethereal way, the News-Letter has<br />\na ways professed an aversion to student politics.<br />\nAs oldtimers recall and wheeze, various political<br />\nmountebanks have tried to do the<br />\nNews-Lettert<br />\nin. Naturally our tempers were<br />\nteased to tolerance, but we maintained our<br />\ndignity to the end and never allowed ourselves a<br />\nstoop to the level of those gewgaws. Unlike the<br />\nHopkins student government, we down at the<br />\nNews-Letter believe in doing the greatest good<br />\nfor the greatest number. We may fail at times,<br />\nbut at least we try. Enough of the bathos and<br />\nback to this boring editorial topic: student<br />\npolitics.<br />\nSo you say you want to be a student<br />\npolitician. Our first impulse is to snicker<br />\n\"Sucker!\" and then, depending upon your<br />\ndisposition, offer either our deepest sympathies<br />\n<br />\nor the backs of our hands. Unfortunately nice<br />\nguys do not make good politicians. Student<br />\nCouncil president David Chesanow is one of the<br />\nnicest guys we know, so we won't even mention<br />\nhis performance in office. Too many people have<br />\nexploited Dave's never-ending kindness for their<br />\nown ends. His effectiveness as a student leader<br />\nwas reduced exponentially by the number of<br />\ndoodly-squat complaints (Should there be pinball<br />\nmachines in the library?) that seemed to find<br />\ntheir way to his already over-burdened attention.<br />\nOf course, David did not keep his campaign<br />\npromise of\"pot for every chicken,\" but that may<br />\nbe because many of his closest advisers and<br />\nassociates were busy dipping into the pot<br />\nthemselves. David has the same problem as a<br />\npromiscuous trollop; he can't say no.<br />\nWe are not suggesting the rise to power of a<br />\ncollegiate Metternich who would divide the<br />\nHomewood campus into a cozy network of<br />\nduchies. Andrew Savitz, a personage once placed<br />\nin the pantheon with Christ and Franz<br />\nWittlesburger, had to wash the brown off his nose<br />\nevery time he left Garland Hall. If you stripped<br />\nSavitz, of his nompositv and arrogance, you<br />\nwould get some schlep who leads Simon Says at<br />\nGrossinger's during the summer. More often than<br />\nnot, the active dynamic student politician is out<br />\nfor nothing but ego gratification, numero unto.<br />\nAndy Savitz got his Rhodes Scholarship, didn't<br />\nhe?<br />\nPerhaps we are advocating the ascension of a<br />\ngentle but firm type of politico.

Appearance aside,<br />\nGeorge Connolly, the sole candidate and presto!<br />\nthe new Student Council President, seems to be<br />\njust the type we were wishing for. From what we<br />\nknow, it seems likely that George will be a good<br />\nCouncil President.

Apathy<br />\nhas seemingly reached a new high. Or perhaps the<br />\nrelative indifference is caused by ignorance. The<br />\nStudent Council made little effort to inform the<br />\npopulace that election time was drawing near. In<br />\nthe back of our minds is the sickening thought<br />\nthat maybe this year's Council deliberately did<br />\nnot public'ae the upcoming election. We all know<br />\nhow they ramrodded the Constitution through,<br />\nthe student body, but it is inconceivable that<br />\nthey could do the same thing with a hand-picked<br />\ncandidate.

Whether sponsored by the Student<br />\nCouncil Social Committee or another organization such as<br />\nthe Rat, the Fine Arts Committee, the Office of Special<br />\nEvents, the BSU, Orientation or the four classes, there<br />\nshould be entertainment scheduled every weekend. It is<br />\nthe job of the Social Director to coordinate these<br />\nactivities and fill in whith his own events whenever there<br />\nis an empty weekend. It is the job of the Social Director<br />\nto coordinate these activities and fill in with his own<br />\nevents whenever there is an empty weekend, a<br />\npredominance of a single type of social event, or a special<br />\noccasion such as the 102 Birthday Celebration. The event<br />\ncan be on a larger scale- a major concert in Shriver Hall- or<br />\nsmaller- a simple coffee house. Movies, free beer nights,<br />\nand rock dances have continually been the best attended<br />\nsocial activities at Hopkins. Alternatives such as coffee<br />\nhouses, jazz, country-rock, and bluegrass bands, wine and<br />\ncheese parties, comediants, and mime must be offered.<br />\nBut the Social Director should be careful with offering<br />\nalternatives and realize the popularity of some events.

Relatively few students<br />\nattended, although, tile general<br />\nnature of the speech was geared<br />\nto those who knew little about<br />\nurban policy and nave limited<br />\naccess to tile news media.<br />\nWhat the Secretary presented<br />\nwas a general overview of past<br />\nUrban policy and some of the<br />\nadministration's broad intentions<br />\nfor the future. Her talk, !Uglily<br />\ncolored by political rhetoric,<br />\njabbed at Nixon/Ford cutbacks<br />\nin urban spending, yet excused<br />\nthe present Urban Policy Task<br />\nForce's foot-dragging by asserting<br />\nthat urban policy must be<br />\ncarefully conceived. The Cabinet<br />\nLevel Task Force, representing<br />\nseven departments, carefully<br />\nconceived for a year. Carter<br />\nrejected that policy-in December,<br />\nPlacing the Task Force and Harris<br />\n<br />\nin a somewhat embattled<br />\nposition.<br />\nA discussion of the problems<br />\nencountered in a policy-making<br />\nprocess involving seven<br />\nautonomous inputs would have<br />\nbeen fascinating, but the political<br />\nrealities of Harris' position<br />\npreclude such frank discussion.<br />\nTne protesters provided the<br />\nonly intellectual stimulation of<br />\nthe evening. The fact that they<br />\nsat down after initially stating<br />\ntheir grievances had very little to<br />\ndo with Harris' glib coercion:<br />\ntheir interest is not chaos, but<br />\ncommunication. Altnough a<br />\nreception was held afterwards to<br />\nallow for questions, tne Secretary<br />\nleft within 15 minutes, apparently<br />\nunable or unwilling to discuss the<br />\nissues raised by the protesters.<br />\nObviously, Harris is not at<br />\nliberty to discuss anything even<br />\nslightly controversial. Engaging<br />\nher to deliver a meaningful<br />\naddress under sucii informal<br />\ncircumstances was a waste of<br />\ntime, effort and University<br />\nmoney. The lecture committee<br />\nmay have believed that having a<br />\nCabinet member speak would<br />\nbring prestige to the University,<br />\nbut Harris' speech worked to the<br />\ndetriment of Hopkins' image.<br />\nTne elementary focus and<br />\npolitical innuendo were insulting<br />\nto most, and her refusal to<br />\ndiscuss HUD issues concerning<br />\nBaltimore was a further snub to<br />\nthe audience.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nSusan C.

The<br />\ngraduate students are too<br />\nspecialized and too<br />\nknowledgeable to participate in a<br />\ndiscussion on tile same level with<br />\nundergraduates.\" Hooker views<br />\nthe TA experience as a \"formal<br />\nopportunity (for grad students)<br />\nto share their wisdom.\" He -is<br />\ninterested in \"improving the<br />\nquality of graduate student<br />\nteaching...teaching them to<br />\nteach.\"<br />\nSome graduate students share<br />\nDean Hooker's pessimism about<br />\nthe feasibility of graduate and<br />\n<br />\nundergraduate students<br />\ninteracting well as classmates. An<br />\nArt History student comments,<br />\n\"It's not possible (for the two<br />\ngroups) to work together. You<br />\nhave to know the material before<br />\nyou can contribute on an equal<br />\nbasis. Undergraduates don't have<br />\nas mucn to offer as graduate<br />\nstudents.\" Other gr,..d students<br />\nare more hopeful. \"In an<br />\nadvanced (foreign language) class<br />\ntaught in(that language),<br />\ngraduate students nave an<br />\nadvantage, but in a class taugnt in<br />\nEnglish, it's different.\" A<br />\nHumanities grad student, taking a<br />\n300-level course tAis semester,<br />\nsees no problem in mixing<br />\nacademically with<br />\nundergraduates. \"It doesn't take<br />\nacademic training to discuss<br />\nliterature. Any classroom is a<br />\ngive-and-take situation. Each<br />\nindividual profits from the class.\"<br />\nAt the undergraduate college he<br />\nattended, an interdisciplinary<br />\ncolloquium on novels written in<br />\nthe 1860's attracted a variety of<br />\nstudents from different fields. He<br />\ndoubts that this would work here<br />\nbecause most graduate students<br />\n<br />\nhave rigorous requirements in<br />\ntheir own departments. A<br />\nHistory student believes that \"a<br />\nreading seminar could work\" if<br />\nundergraduates were given time<br />\nfor intensive reading. A Writing<br />\nSeminars undergraduate suggests<br />\nan extracurricular<br />\napproach--attending meetings of<br />\nthe \"First Draft\" and \"Tudor<br />\nand Stuart\" clubs.<br />\nAlthough some contact<br />\nbetween Hopkins' graduate and<br />\nundergraduate student<br />\npopulations occurs, the<br />\nuniversity structure discourages<br />\nintellectual and social sharing.<br />\nAccording to The Humanities<br />\nbulletin, \"For the enterprising<br />\nstudent, Hopkins ilas<br />\nopportunities that don't exist<br />\nanywhere else that I know of.\"<br />\nThus, to transcend the<br />\nuniversity's \"permeable walls,\"<br />\nthe \"two student bodies\" must<br />\nmake an effort as individuals to<br />\nmeet each other and to share<br />\ninformation.

He has been involved in many apsects of<br />\nmedical school admissions. In this interview he answers<br />\nsome of the questions most frequently asked by medical<br />\nschool applicants: improving one's chances of being<br />\naccepted from the waiting list, requesting an interview<br />\nwith an admissions committee after being rejected and<br />\nlater gaining acceptance to the same school the following<br />\nyear.<br />\nDr. Gryder is available to personally answer students'<br />\nquestions in Homewood House during most weekday<br />\nafternoons. To make an appointment, students should call<br />\nLinda Garren at 338-7974. A complete text of this<br />\ninterview can be found in Linda Garren's office.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gryder: The Preil<br />\n<br />\nInterviewer: What is the general timetable for<br />\nadmissions to medical school as far as notifications for<br />\ninterviews and acceptances?<br />\nDr. Gryder: It varies tremendously. Some schools start<br />\naccepting very soon after July 1. I guess the first<br />\nacceptances that I heard of last year were in late August.<br />\nAnd then there are some people who are still getting<br />\ninterviews now even though their applications were in a<br />\nlong time ago.<br />\nInt: What is the latest time an applicant should expect<br />\nto hear for inter Dr. Gryder: Last year there were some<br />\npeople who received interviews in June.<br />\nInt: Were these applicants successful in getting in?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I'd have to go back and check exactly but I<br />\nthink some of those were successful.<br />\nInt: What do you do if you are an applicant at this<br />\nstage, and you have only received one interview or have<br />\nnot heard anything at all and have received a few<br />\nrejections?<br />\nDr. Gryder: The person should come to see me.<br />\nSometimes when I talk to the individual I can detect<br />\nthings that may have given a false impression in his ,<br />\ninterviews. These can sometimes be corrected in future<br />\ninterviews and sometimes additional information can be<br />\nsent to schools to compensate for the false impressions.<br />\nInt: Is litere anything the applicant can do to enhance<br />\nhis position on his own?<br />\nDr. Gryder_ That's a little tricky. I don't think it does<br />\nany harm if you contact the school either by phone or<br />\nletter, once in a wiiile, although some schools discourage<br />\nthat. You should not make a pest of yourself.<br />\nInt: Is it advisable to retake the MCAT in April if you<br />\nare still on the waiting list or have not heard anything<br />\nfrom any schools?<br />\nDr. Gryder: If you want to make another attempt and<br />\nyou think that the MCAT is part of the reasoa you stave<br />\nnot gotten in, then, it is a good idea. If you already have<br />\ngood MCAT's then, it is not necessary. Again, I think it is<br />\nbest to see me for each individual case to try to establish<br />\nwhy you are having difficulty.<br />\nInt: Again, if you are an applicant vino has not heard<br />\nanything as yet or have had very few interviews, w.tat else<br />\nIt was Sunday afternoon, and the mindless gang that<br />\nhad kept the Frat party rocking late into the night were<br />\nnow groaning and leaning on the dormitory railing outside<br />\nthe door. Some sat glassy- eyed on the steps, gyrating<br />\nheads resting in pairs of hands. Others were still awake,<br />\nspeeding yet from the previous evening, and dashing back<br />\nand forth across the quad in pursuit of frisbees. One space<br />\npioneer, young Alex, was already busily tripping after his<br />\nusual sabboth hit of micro-dot.<br />\nIt wasn't always this bad the morning after. Usually we<br />\nwould meet in one of our rooms and bong it up--best<br />\nthing in the world for a hangover; Sunday, however, we<br />\nwere dry. Not one of the nine of us had a single speck,<br />\nseed, or step of pot. We sat, groaning in unison, until an<br />\nolder student, maybe a graduate, came whistling towards<br />\nus with a bulging,sack thrown over one shoulder.<br />\nHe made his way through our tangled heap of bodies<br />\nup the steps, turned and asked, \"What the hell is wrong<br />\nwith you guys, you look awful?\"<br />\nIt was our cue; we had a special prayer that we used in<br />\nresponse to such questions during times of such need. We<br />\nscrambled into position \u2022 of such need. We scrambled into<br />\nposition, three rows of three on each of the steps, and<br />\nbegan to sing in parched, cracking cacophony:<br />\n\"Our Father, Who art-in Columbia,<br />\nBlasted be thy brain.<br />\nThy bong be full, thy pipe aflame<br />\nWhen you get fried with Cain.<br />\nGive us this day our daily high,<br />\nAnd forgive us out lung power,<br />\nJust as we forgive those who such down all our reefer.<br />\nLead us not unto a bad trip,<br />\nBut deliver us from narcs,<br />\nFor thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory<br />\nOf agriculture in Columbia.\"\u2022<br />\n\"That was great,\" he told us,\"but why are you hanging<br />\n<br />\nshould you be doing to protect yourself for the future?<br />\ni.e; what other programs should you pursue during the<br />\none year interval before you re-apply?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think that everyone, not just unsuccessful<br />\n__should have been<br />\nnot just unsuccessful candidates,<br />\nwhat tney<br />\nfreshmen<br />\nthey're<br />\ntime<br />\nthe<br />\nfrom<br />\nconsidering<br />\nmight like to do for a second choice. Sometimes they find<br />\nthey are really more interested in the second choice and<br />\nthen never: apply to medical school. But restricting the<br />\nanswer to your question about someone who in the<br />\nprocess who hasn't heard anything, he should be thinking<br />\nabout his options at this point, trying to discover the<br />\nkinds of rewards he expects from medicine, both<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gryder\u2014Before<br />\nmonetarily and personally, where else he might make the<br />\ncontributions he wants to make, and the kinds of rewards<br />\nhe wants. He should realistically appraise nis strengths and<br />\nweaknesses. He should have something else in mind that<br />\nhe could do so that he doesn't waste a year bumming<br />\naround, unless he is doing that intentionally because he<br />\nfeels that's the best thing for him. But he shouldn't be<br />\nforced into doing something just because he hasn't gotten<br />\ninto medical school, and there isn't anything to do.Such a<br />\nperson should certainly be considering his options. It<br />\nmight be that he would like to go off and do something<br />\nfor a couple of years and try again. All sorts of<br />\npossibilities exist that would be different for each<br />\nparticular individual.<br />\n<br />\nInt: Some people say that medical schools seem to like<br />\nthe idea of a student taking a year off and just leaving the<br />\nfield of academics for a while. Is this a good idea?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think tnat depends very much on why<br />\nyou were not accepted the first time. If it was because of<br />\npoor grades, for example, then getting a master's degree in<br />\nsome field is to your advantage if you do well in the<br />\ncourse work. I do think it is different for each person. I<br />\ncan give you examples of people who have been successful<br />\nat getting into medical school doing all sorts of things.<br />\nincluding one who was a taxi driver.<br />\nInt: Are there certain areas of interest in graduate<br />\nprograms that are better to pursue than others!?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think it varies from individual to<br />\nindividual. I really don't think that there is a single<br />\napproach that is universally recommended.<br />\nInt: When an applicant reapplies in the future is there<br />\nanything he should be aware of'?<br />\nDr. Gryder: Yes. The first thing he should be aware of<br />\nis to keep the recommendations committee informed of<br />\nhis plans and to update the information in his files. Many<br />\npeople think they should sort of slink off after they're<br />\nunsuccessful and they are not heard of again until some<br />\ntime in December when they make a telephone call to<br />\nMiss Garren saying, \"Send off the material in my file.\"<br />\nFrequently if they come around and talk to us we can<br />\nmodify the letters, put in something they have done, that<br />\ncompensates for weaknesses in the past, and give a better<br />\npackage to the medical schools. They should keep us<br />\ninformed about what they're doing.<br />\nInt: Then the applicant should obtain additional<br />\nrecommendations from people he has worked with:<br />\nDr. Gryder: Yes, that's right. If he is doing something<br />\nwhich permits someone to find out about him in a<br />\ndifferent way, we can write a more recent letter of<br />\nrecommendation. We'll have to incorporate that in a new<br />\nletter. I know it has helped in some cases.<br />\nInt: Is it advisable for an applicant, who has not been<br />\naccepted the first time around and, has one school in<br />\nparticular he wishes to attend, to request an interview<br />\nwith the admissions committee, after they have made a<br />\nnegative decision, to find out what he can do to enhance<br />\nhis candidacy at that medical school?<br />\nDr. Gryder: That has proven to be successful in some<br />\ncases. Again, I think it depends on the particular medical<br />\nschool in this situation. Some are more receptive to doing<br />\nthat than othels and I think that also changes from year<br />\nto year depending upon who the director of admissions is<br />\nat a medical school. I don't think it does any harm,.<br />\nhowever. In fact, I know some people who were on the<br />\nwaiting list to the very end and then applied early<br />\ndecision at the school even though their credentials were<br />\n<br />\nHigh Drama: The D<br />\naround singing--enjoy!\"<br />\n\"We can't help it,\" we answered,\"we're straight.\"<br />\nWe didn't know it at the time, but we had been run<br />\ninto by just the right man to end our blues. \"We need<br />\nsome j's\" we began ensemble, \"To cure our daze\" -another favorite chorus.<br />\nHe asked us if we wanted to get high so bad why didn't<br />\nwe make some phone calls and hustle up some weed. We<br />\ntold him that we already had done so, first thing when we<br />\ngot us, but that there weren't any ounces to be had. Not a<br />\nsingle gram of oily hash, not a crystal of cocaine, not even<br />\nan old multi-colored hit of speed was available to get us<br />\nback on track that morning.<br />\nHe told us he had to go see the house-master in<br />\nJennings and then he'd stop back and give us some, er,<br />\nadvice.<br />\nWe all sat us when we saw his head pop through the<br />\ndoor of the dormitory; had he been scoring us some<br />\ndrugs? The student walked past our group, motioning us<br />\nto follow him into the bakment. Going down the stairs<br />\nnine pairs of eyes lit up as their object of vision put tour<br />\njoints into his mouth and put a match to all four.<br />\nWe got high with him for an hour or so, all the while<br />\nreceiving some free advice from a seemingly<br />\nknowledgeable source. He drilled us on search and seizure<br />\nlaws, travelling with drugs, bong- cleaning methods, and<br />\nnumerous other `wheres and whens'. He didn't know that<br />\nwe were taking notes, and he might eveni be angry if we<br />\nlet his secrets be made public, but in the interest of every<br />\nresin-blooded student on campus we have listed a number<br />\nof his key suggestions. While these rules of thumb are by<br />\nno means all-inclusive, we have found them to be<br />\nindispensible at Hopkins' higher altitudes.<br />\n<br />\nllorkiN\"<br />\n<br />\n\fDr. Gryder: If you are on the waiting list you certainly<br />\nwant to keep them informed of your continual interest in<br />\nthe school. This becomes particularly important if you are<br />\non the waiting lists towards tile end of the summer. In the<br />\nbeginning, most schools have their lists (rank ordered),<br />\nand there probably is not much you can do to change tile<br />\norder at the beginning of the summer. As time goes on, if<br />\nthey have some openings towards the end of the summer,<br />\nit becomes much more important to them to fill that<br />\nposition than it is to keep the order they have on the<br />\nwaiting list, and they have decided anyone on the waiting<br />\nlist is acceptable. 8o that as the summer draws to an end<br />\nand you're still on the waiting lists and have not been<br />\naccepted, let them know where you can be reached by<br />\ntelephone 'where somebody is going to answer that<br />\ntelephone day or night. Frequently they will just go down<br />\nthe list until they get the first person who is there. That is<br />\ncertainly a way of increasing your chances of Ibeing<br />\ntaken off the waiting list.<br />\nInt: How should you keep them informed of where<br />\nyou could be reached? Should the applicant talk to the<br />\ndirector of admissions or write a letter?Dr. Gryder:<br />\nProbably not to tne director. This is usually done, I think,<br />\nby the secretary in charge at the end when somebody<br />\ndoes not show up and the director says, \"Get on that<br />\nphone and find somebody.\" Both by letter and phone.<br />\nAgain, not making a pest of yourself but showing that<br />\nyour interest is still there.<br />\nInt: Would a personal visit be useful to help the<br />\nsecretary remember you?<br />\nDr. Gryder: It could be that a personal visit would be<br />\nhelpful, yes.<br />\nInt: Suppose an applicant has a very strong preference<br />\nfor one school in particular, and he has not heard<br />\nanything from them. Should he contact the school?<br />\nDr. Gryder: 1 think if you do it once, that is perfectly<br />\nall right, too. Let them know that it really is your first<br />\nchoice...You are on safer grounds in doing that if you<br />\nhave been accepted someplace else--that there is still<br />\nanother school that is your first choice because I<br />\nthink--and this is just hearsay--but I' m pretty sure that<br />\nsome schools, if .they notice you have been accepted<br />\nsomeplace else, are less likely to give you an offer.<br />\n<br />\n4ed Survival Course<br />\nnot particularly good. When I say 'not good,'they were from the graduate school he is in. If he has been<br />\nunderhanded with them, it may be harder to pull in<br />\nnot the sort of credentials that one would normally say an<br />\nwho is willing to write a good letter.

If he is not having good success I think it is<br />\nbetter. if it comes from someone else who can add<br />\nadditional comments other than just the grades. Sending<br />\nthe grades provides another excuse for bringing the<br />\ncandidate to the attention of the -committee.<br />\nInt: Should that someone else be a faculty member or a<br />\nperson on toe Pre-Medical Recommendations Committee?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think it is better if he is on the Pre-Medical<br />\nRecommendations Committee because that person has<br />\naccess to what was said before. I can recall some cases in<br />\nwhich people had a bad semester just before the letter was<br />\nwritten. Then the person writing the letterwould say that<br />\nthe earlier years were indicative of his true ability. Then,<br />\nif this person comes out with a particularly strong<br />\nsemester later, we can refer back to the letter and say,<br />\n\"See, I was right.\" If you get to know someone well after<br />\nthe recommendation has been sent, have the letters sent<br />\nto the Committee to be forwarded to the schools.<br />\nInt: What does it mean to be placed on a medical<br />\nschool's waiting list?<br />\nDr. Gryder: That varies from school to school, but sort<br />\nof as a rule of thumb it means that your chances at that<br />\nschool are somewhere between one in three and one in<br />\ntwo of being accepted. So if you are on several waiting<br />\nlists your chances are pretty good that you'll pick up on<br />\none of them. Unfortunately, that could be the day classes<br />\nDr. Grvder\u2014After<br />\nstart, so you really do not know if you're going to go to<br />\nmedical school or not if you're on several waiting lists<br />\nuntil sometime in September, which, going to the it will make it harder for him to get into graduate school<br />\nPrevious question about what you should do in the event but, not impossible. I think anybody who has a record<br />\nyou don't get into medical school, makes it very difficult that is ever going to get him into medical school is going<br />\nfor planning. Something I don't recommend is to go to to beable to get into graduate school. Maybe not his first<br />\ngraduate school without letting the graduate school know choice graduate school, but I think that is less important<br />\nYou are still a pre-med, for two reasons. One, it is sort of should his ultimate goal still really be to go to medical<br />\nunfair to the graduate school. We, in chemistry, last year school. There are some people who should really change<br />\nlost somebody on the first day of classes because he got their minds. I'm not suggesting that everyone should<br />\npicked up by a medical school. But aside from being re-apply. But, if he certainly is re-applying I don't think it<br />\nunfair to the graduate school, I think it's also unfair to will cause any difficulties.<br />\nInt: What can an applicant who is on the waiting list do<br />\nthe student in the event he isn't picked up that year<br />\nenhance his credentials?<br />\nto<br />\n1<br />\nrecommendatim3<br />\nof<br />\nletter<br />\na<br />\nwant<br />\nto<br />\ngoing<br />\nbecause he is<br />\n<br />\ng Scene At Hopkins<br />\nPi<br />\nAT \u2022<br />\nAvsi\u2022<br />\nWAS<br />\n<br />\n,.)0.,ED<br />\nQ<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\nV\" '<br />\nANJCE-1<br />\n<br />\n\u00b0Never buy pot on a Baltimore street, especially on the<br />\nBlock. The problem is not the chance of arrest, rather it is<br />\nthe likelihood of purchasing the dealer's own secret<br />\nmixture of sawdust and sand. The safest drugs are on<br />\ncampus.<br />\n2)If you must sell dope, never sell to non-students you<br />\ndon't know. It only takes one bust.<br />\n3)The safest place to smoke is home. Cops mind<br />\nsmoking much less than smoking while driving or smoking<br />\nwhile walking down the street in front of Police<br />\nHeadquarters.<br />\n4)Register all bong-a-thons with NORML for<br />\nachievement awards. Make sure to mark the size of each<br />\nhit taken as :Wimp, lightweight, mediocre, regular,<br />\npremium, super-regular, lung-buster, professional, Hoover,<br />\nor Eureka.<br />\n5)Never clean your bongs in the bathroom sinks. Who<br />\nup with pipe tar and bong-stench while<br />\nwants to put<br />\nthey're shaving? There are plenty of custodial wash<br />\nclosets which can be used; if your custodian objects you<br />\ncan use \"Frannie's House\"\u2014 third floor Lazear near the<br />\ndoor to Jennings. Long as you clean up, \"Frannie t'ain't<br />\nbe mindin\".<br />\n6)Never smoke joints on the platforms at the Baltmore<br />\ntrain station waiting for trains. The Amtrak Red-Cpas,<br />\nwhose eyes are usually more red than their caps, will<br />\nswoop down on you, assume a voice of authority, and<br />\n\"confiscate that illegal-smelling cigarette\"; it is<br />\nextinguished and placed in a tin box with any others<br />\nfound until the end of the shift.<br />\nIf you have to smoke on a train, wait until the train is<br />\nmoving, then blow a quick joint between cars, keeping<br />\none open for the conductors and the other for a chick<br />\n<br />\nInt: So, in other words, getting into another place<br />\ncould hurt you?<br />\nDr. Gryder: To some extent. I think this is a secondary<br />\nproblem, and I think some schools do not pay any<br />\nattention to it, but I think that some do not give offers,<br />\nand particularly should you be interested in a school<br />\nwhich on paper looks inferior to one you have been<br />\naccepted in. Then I think it is very important that you let<br />\nthem know that you still want to go for it.<br />\nInt: Snould the applicant state during the interview<br />\nthat the school is his first choice?<br />\nDr. Gryder: As long as it conies out as sincere on youi<br />\npart. You don't do it just because you think it is going to<br />\nincrease your chances at a given school. I think it's usually<br />\ntransparent.<br />\n<br />\nwho's looking to get high.<br />\n7)If you're ever caught smoking by a Baltimore cop,<br />\nthere are three options, the choosing of which will<br />\ndetermine whether it's a simple head rush or a two-year<br />\nsentence. a) If he's over thirty-five, whip out your<br />\nHopkins I.S., say you didn't know what jio\u2014UW-efe doing,<br />\nand offer him a shoe shine; b) If he's under thirty-five,<br />\ndon't show him your I.D. He's liable to be jealous and do<br />\nan extra good job of frisking you. Instead, offer him a<br />\ncouple of tokes, which is probably all he was after<br />\nanyway; c) If you're too high to tell how old he is, you<br />\nmight as well not fight it; you'll probably laugh through<br />\nthe whole thing.<br />\n8)For the hard core, commandment number eight goes<br />\nwithout saying, but it is sound advice for the drug-initiate.<br />\nKeep Visine handy. For the time that you can't resist a<br />\nfew bongs before class or work, Visine is supreme. Don't<br />\nforget;it's when one's eyes are red that one is high.<br />\n9)Pay no attention to marijuana's color in shopping<br />\naround. Light does tricky things, and so do bleach, red<br />\nink, dyes and haircoloring.<br />\n10) If you're ever caught- smoking by a campus cop,<br />\nlaugh. He's not going to bother you unless you're smoking<br />\n'destructive' marijuana-- braking chairs -iver piles of<br />\nbodies, or trash. Unless you cause an awful lot of trouble,<br />\nyou have a certain amount of freedom of choice that<br />\ndoesn's exist anywhere but on 'college campuses-- where<br />\npeople who don't get high seem to enjoy pondering the<br />\npossibilities as much as people who do. Living at Hopkins<br />\npresents the unique opportunity to, while remaining at a<br />\ndecend academic status, get blown out a lot. For those of<br />\nyou who do, cheers.

Their<br />\nlatest production, Tennessee Williams' The Night of the<br />\nIguana, represents a poor effort on the part of all. Why<br />\nthis dull play was ever chosen in the first place is beyond<br />\ncomprehension, but its weaknesses, too glaring for even<br />\nthe most professional company to overcome, render this<br />\nproduction almost laughable. It certainly offers no<br />\naesthetic or intellectual satisfaction.<br />\nDr. Edward Berkeley, handicapped from the start with<br />\nthis mediocre script, saddled himself with unskilled<br />\nactors, allowed Set Designer Peter Harvey to run totally<br />\namuck with fluorescent paint and cardboard, pawed<br />\nthrough Goodwill's ten cent record collection for the<br />\nincidental music, and then had the ,nerve to present this<br />\nmess to an audience of unsuspecting octogenarians in the<br />\nhope they would like it. And the saddest part is, they<br />\nprobably did. The critics sure did.<br />\nThe play itself is full of cliches,. ethnic slurs and<br />\nstereotypes. It lacks poignancy, humor and message. I had<br />\ntrouble even finding a theme to latch on to. Only one<br />\ncharacter seems real and deserving of our attention. The<br />\nrest are transparent bores who for the most part stand<br />\naround trying to look like they belong on a steamy<br />\nMexican veranda in 1940. They are expected to be hot and<br />\nfrustrated, as most of Williams' characters are, but there is<br />\nno evidence of true feeling or motivation, nor even a<br />\nsense ot that intangible known as stage presence.<br />\nOur hero, Shannon, is a real let-down. His character is<br />\nso poorly defined that we can't decide whether to love or<br />\nto hate him. Not that we care--he is presented as a victim<br />\nof jungle fever (and that's not alp\u2014but it is only when the<br />\nlines remind him that he remembers to act nauseous and<br />\nlethargic. And even then he is unconvincing. Janet Sarno<br />\nas Maxine, the touch chick who runs the motel at which<br />\n[he action takes place, takes her role far too seriously. She<br />\n<br />\ncomes across as the ultimate in sexy bitchiness, and plays productions this season, The Rivals and The Runner<br />\nit to the hilt.

By Penelope Gilliatt. 147 pp. Coward,<br />\nMcCann and Geohegan. $7.95.<br />\n<br />\nBY MIKE GIULIANO<br />\n<br />\nPenelope Gilliat<br />\n<br />\nPenelope Gilliatt, a film critic for The New Yorker, has<br />\nalso written short stories and novels, as well as tile<br />\nscreenplay for Sunday Bloody Sunday, whicit received a<br />\nnomination for an Academy Award. Splendid Lives, her<br />\nnew collection of nine short stories, could be labelled a<br />\ncollection of transatlantic stories, because so many of<br />\nthem are set in England and America.Her own life is split<br />\nbetween New York, London and tile Continent, so it's<br />\nnot surprising butt her fiction often deals with the<br />\nproblems of jet-set life. \"Fleeced\" is the story of a boy<br />\nabandoned on a tropical island by his jet-set parents. In<br />\n\"Autumn of a Doormouse,\" a grandmother and ner<br />\ngrandson make 37 round trips, on a daily basis, from New<br />\nYork to Rome. These are unusual problems, but Gilliatt's<br />\n<br />\n,naracters are usually wealthier, better educated and more<br />\neloquent than the average person.<br />\nAlong with their greater wealth and verbal facility<br />\nthere's<br />\nalso a good deal of eccentricity, as if Gilliatt, like<br />\nIP<br />\nso many English writers before her, is determined to<br />\nprove that no one is more eccentric than an Englishman.<br />\nThis eccentricity, however, is- admirable. Their lives are<br />\nsplendid lives. The main character in toe title story, for<br />\ninstance, is the Bishop of Hurlingham, who at 92 recalls<br />\nhis pre-World War I imprisonment for aiding suffragettes,<br />\nall the while cutting into nis quail pie and plotting new<br />\nmischief. The grandmother in \"Autumn of a Dormouse\"<br />\nsums up Gilliatt's attitude towards eccentricity rather<br />\nnicely: \"people will tell us we're eccentric, but everyone's<br />\neccentric when you get to know them, thank<br />\ngoodness.\"<br />\nAlthough none of these stories is splendid, they do<br />\ncontain a wealth of splendid, eccentric characters, woo<br />\nare preoccupied witii transatlantic interests and worries,<br />\nand woo are confronted, as in \"Iron Larks,\" with the fact<br />\nthat \"French toast is<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16 / MARCH 10, 1978<br />\n<br />\nNONDENOMINATIONAL'<br />\nOFFICE OF THE<br />\nThe<br />\nCHAPLAIN<br />\n6unday<br />\nprzesents<br />\nExperience\\,_<br />\n<br />\n(MoOds Foa Goeo'<br />\nDR.

After<br />\nstudying the paintings, assemblages and environmental<br />\ndisplays of such artists as Max Ernst, Rene Magritte and<br />\nSalvador Dali, the twenty students enrolled in the class<br />\nwere required to submit either a paper or a conceptual art<br />\nproject in which they exercised their knowledge of the<br />\nprinciples underlying surrealist art. The suggested project,<br />\nwhich was the more popular alternative, was to show in a<br />\ncareful drawing or collage how one could drastically<br />\nchange a conspicuous building, monument or public place<br />\nin Baltimore so as to surprise passersby, divert them from<br />\ntheir customary tasks and thoughts and prompt<br />\nassociative thinking. The project was to be accompanied<br />\nby a text explaining the creation's subversive effect and<br />\nmeaning. Of the students who submitted projects, more<br />\nthan half decided to metamorphose a building on or near<br />\ncampus. Here are some of their rather sensational results:<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nwhich actually, seemed to suggest a camera. The top of<br />\nthe museum was triangular, so (almost) was the top of a<br />\ncamera. The semi-cylindrical portions of the museum's<br />\nfacade suggested body parts of a camera too. The student<br />\n<br />\n'More than<br />\nhalf decided to<br />\nmetamorphose<br />\na building........\"<br />\nadded a shutter release and a winding button to her<br />\ndrawing and the museum's transformation into a camera<br />\n\"was complete.\" Not yet satisfied, she decided to change<br />\nthe columns at the museum's entrance and, in order to<br />\nobtain a surprising and original idea, she asked a friend<br />\nwhat \"column\" spontaneously suggested to him. He<br />\nthought of newspaper columns; she used that association<br />\nin her picture. Finally, she substituted a gigantic broken<br />\nflashcube for the Duchamp-Villon sculpture at the steps<br />\nleading up to the Museum of Art. She is confident that if<br />\nher idea were ever fully realized, it would cause passersby<br />\nto stop dead in their tracks, forget tneir daily<br />\nbusiness\u2014and wonder.<br />\nWhat would be the poetic meaning of her building?<br />\nAmong other things Ms. Anderson feels that a<br />\ncamera-shaped museum would cause people to reflect on<br />\nthe nature of art. Like film in a camera, paintings and<br />\nsculptures in a museum mirror the world which<br />\nexists outside its walls.<br />\nAnother student's project was more cynical:<br />\n<br />\nOther students proposed: to transform Johns Hopkins<br />\ncampus into a colossal sterile chamber supplied with<br />\noxygen from a tank in Gilman Hall; to transform Mudd<br />\nHall, tne new biology building, into an Erlenmeyer flask;<br />\nto replace the sculpture in front of the MSE Library with<br />\na gargantuan rubber snowboot; to transform Shriver Hall<br />\ninto a living organism supported by human limbs; to<br />\ntransform the bronze sculpture in tile center of Charles<br />\nCenter Plaza into a nuge blown fuse or a beating heart; to<br />\ntransform the Peabody Library into a graveyard<br />\nenvironment where subway vents in the floors were<br />\nwindows on graves and archways, and bookcases<br />\nsuggested hidden images of skulls; to balance the World<br />\nTrade Center precariously on a pyramid symbolic of<br />\nthe American dollar; and to nave the vertical shaft of the<br />\nWashington Monument seized by a colossal nand. Two<br />\nstudents made familiar sights in Baltimore, tile MSE<br />\nLibrary and the U.S.S. Constellation, the focus of an<br />\ninner drama and the manifest content of a dream.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nThe starting point for the composition was a broken<br />\nflashcube which the student noticed and picked up in<br />\nfront of the museum. She claims tnat at first she could<br />\nnot identify it and admired it solely for its mystery. After<br />\nshe realized what it was, it occurred to her tnat perhaps<br />\none would surprise people and stimulate associative<br />\nthinking if one were to transform the building in front of<br />\nwhich she found the flashcube, the Baltimore Museum,<br />\ninto an object that the flashcube suggested to her--a<br />\ncamera. The transformation of the museum entrance into<br />\na colossal camera lens indeed seemed rather startling.(We<br />\ntend to perceive museum entrances as benign and passive<br />\nthings--gateways to look at and pass through; the<br />\nsubstituted lens would be bewildering because<br />\nnon-ingressible, frightening, and suggestive of an unknown<br />\npresence watching). Moreover, the association of camera<br />\nand museum brought out several features of the museum<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nMEMO41M14141.1\u202214<br />\n<br />\nThe shape of Garland Hall spontaneously suggested a<br />\ncash register to this student who feels that that<br />\nassociation is just \"in light of increasing tuition costs.\" At<br />\nthe top of his building, transformed into a money<br />\nmachine, is a row of nines stretching across the entire<br />\nwidth to indicate that \"the University,just like any other<br />\nbusiness, is trying to make as large a profit as it possibly<br />\ncan.\" (The nines suggest that, he explains, because, for<br />\nany given number of digits, the greatest numerical value is<br />\nobtained by repeating nines).<br />\nNot content with only one interpretation for Garland<br />\n(he was aware of the surrealist fondness for multiple<br />\nimagery), he discovered that if the streets around Garland<br />\nwere considered as a continuous configuration and<br />\nobserved from an area between Ames and Latrobe Halls,<br />\nthey suggested an anthropomorphic figure whose arms<br />\nand legs are formed by the streets. According to the<br />\nstudent, this robot represents a pre-med student. The<br />\nstethoscope and scalpel in tae two front windows of the<br />\nbuilding which suggest the robot's eyes represent the<br />\npre-med's burning ambition and sole purpose for<br />\nexistence: to become a doctor. The ears of this pre-med<br />\nhave been left out purposely to emphasize tile desire and<br />\nthe robot-like head underscores it. Like a robot, lie<br />\nclaims, a pre-med student is programmed-4cademically<br />\nprogrammed--to do only one tiling (be a doctor). A<br />\nsignificant number of pre-med students, however, are,<br />\nunfortunately, unable to nandle their program; they find<br />\nthe course load too much and are forced to drop their<br />\npre-med studies. Like the nines which flash on in an<br />\nelectronic calculator's digits display wnen the calculator's<br />\nsystem is overloaded, the nines flashing at the top of tile<br />\npre-med student's head allegedly represent an overload.<br />\nHe is no longer in tne running; the proverbial \"axe\" has<br />\nfallen on him.

The<br />\nintroduction the The Humanities<br />\nbrochure elaborates: \"(Daniel<br />\nCoit) Gilman managed to capture<br />\nthe essence of the European<br />\neducation system with its<br />\nemphasis on academic freedom,<br />\ngraduate study, and research, and<br />\nto translate it to the American<br />\nscene. In doing so he won a place<br />\nfor higher learning in a culture<br />\nthat until that time had rejected<br />\nthe theoretical and nad been<br />\nbasically indifferent to.<br />\nfundamental research.\" It<br />\ncontinues, \"You may wonder<br />\nwhat the key is to this unusuali<br />\nHopkins system....How it has<br />\nmanaged to remain a place where<br />\na good deal of the education that<br />\ngoes on stems from the \u2022<br />\nstudents\u2014both undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate\u2014motivating each other?<br />\nThe answer to this question says<br />\na lot about the kind of place<br />\nHopkins is.\" Unfortunately, the<br />\nbulletin seems to have missed a<br />\nmore important question: Why is<br />\nthis university hierarchy<br />\nstructured, in a way that<br />\ndiscourages<br />\nundergraduate-graduate<br />\nrelations?<br />\n\"Department walls are very<br />\nPermeable,\" a faculty member<br />\nremarks in .The Humanities<br />\nbulletin. An English grad student<br />\ndisagrees. \"The graduate<br />\nstudents, in general, don't freely<br />\nassociate with each other, so why<br />\nshould they be expected to<br />\nassociate with the<br />\nundergraduates?\" -Every grad<br /><br />\nstudent interviewed mentioned<br />\nacademic and social<br />\n\"compartmentalization\" among<br />\ndepartments. For example, an<br />\nArt History grad student feels<br />\nfamiliar with only \"a part of the<br />\nschool, in that I know graduate<br />\nstudents in the humanities.. I<br />\nknow no science grad students.\"<br />\nA Romance Languages grad<br />\nstudent admits that it is \"easy to<br />\ndepartmentalize yourself...Even<br />\nwithin Romance Languages,<br />\n[students of a particular<br />\nlanguage] stick to themselves.\"<br />\nSmall seminars and independent<br />\nresearch separate graduate<br />\nstudents from each other and<br />\nalso from the undergraduates.<br />\n\"We're really two student<br />\nbodies,\" an Art History grad<br />\nstudent says. All of his courses<br />\nare saninars \"from which<br />\nundergraduates are , excluded.\"<br />\n\"Graduate students approach the<br />\nmaterial differently,\" he says.<br />\n\"They have greater knowledge.<br />\nUndergraduates can be very<br />\nsophomoric. Their theories are<br />\nnot based in solid fact\". A<br />\nChemistry grad student agrees.<br />\n\"What junior could sit in On a<br />\ngraduate-level Physics course? It's<br />\njust impossible!\" But some<br />\ndepartments are structured to<br />\nfacilitate graduate-undergraduate<br />\ninteraction. \"I don't think there's<br />\na -.big gap between graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students,\"<br />\nHumanities Center grad student<br />\nremarks. \"A graduate student has<br />\na piece of paper. But Humanities<br />\nis the exception to the rule,\" he<br />\nadmits. Also, History grad<br />\nstudents mix with<br />\nundergraduates in some classes.<br />\nAlthough 300-level courses are<br />\nnot required as part of his<br />\ncurriculum, one History grad<br /><br />\nstudent audited a course last<br />\nsemester to gain competence in<br />\nantebellum American studies.<br />\nCurrently, 15% of the students<br />\nenrolled in 300-level courses are<br />\ngraduate students; 10% of<br />\n600-level students are<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nThe most common way that<br />\nundergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents share knowledge is<br />\n1:s<br />\nthrough conferences, at which<br />\nthe grad students act as teaching c3<br />\nassistants. Many graduate<br />\nI Chris Tomlins<br />\nstudents gain their, only contact<br />\nwith undergraduates through<br />\nbeing TA's. Student experiences<br />\nwith TA's vary greatly.

Ah, in<br />\nspring a youngster's fancy turns to thoughts of<br />\nlove and politics; while some may see one as a<br />\nstepping stone to the other, matters of the heart<br />\nand of the government do not mix. To be a<br />\nconsummate<br />\nthough<br />\nnot consummated)<br />\npolitician one has to be ruthless, tough,<br />\nambitious, egotistical, arrogant, fanatical,<br />\ndogmatic, and pragmtic. Just take a look at Stu<br />\nDavidson. If one is looking for a little<br />\nhubba-hubba, the Hopkins student government,<br />\nat any level, is not the place to begin the search.<br />\nIn its own ethereal way, the News-Letter has<br />\na ways professed an aversion to student politics.<br />\nAs oldtimers recall and wheeze, various political<br />\nmountebanks have tried to do the<br />\nNews-Lettert<br />\nin.

Unlike the<br />\nHopkins student government, we down at the<br />\nNews-Letter believe in doing the greatest good<br />\nfor the greatest number. We may fail at times,<br />\nbut at least we try. Enough of the bathos and<br />\nback to this boring editorial topic: student<br />\npolitics.<br />\nSo you say you want to be a student<br />\npolitician. Our first impulse is to snicker<br />\n\"Sucker!\" and then, depending upon your<br />\ndisposition, offer either our deepest sympathies<br /><br />\nor the backs of our hands. Unfortunately nice<br />\nguys do not make good politicians. Student<br />\nCouncil president David Chesanow is one of the<br />\nnicest guys we know, so we won't even mention<br />\nhis performance in office. Too many people have<br />\nexploited Dave's never-ending kindness for their<br />\nown ends. His effectiveness as a student leader<br />\nwas reduced exponentially by the number of<br />\ndoodly-squat complaints (Should there be pinball<br />\nmachines in the library?) that seemed to find<br />\ntheir way to his already over-burdened attention.<br />\nOf course, David did not keep his campaign<br />\npromise of\"pot for every chicken,\" but that may<br />\nbe because many of his closest advisers and<br />\nassociates were busy dipping into the pot<br />\nthemselves. David has the same problem as a<br />\npromiscuous trollop; he can't say no.<br />\nWe are not suggesting the rise to power of a<br />\ncollegiate Metternich who would divide the<br />\nHomewood campus into a cozy network of<br />\nduchies.

If you stripped<br />\nSavitz, of his nompositv and arrogance, you<br />\nwould get some schlep who leads Simon Says at<br />\nGrossinger's during the summer.

Appearance aside,<br />\nGeorge Connolly, the sole candidate and presto!<br />\nthe new Student Council President, seems to be<br />\njust the type we were wishing for.

Apathy<br />\nhas seemingly reached a new high. Or perhaps the<br />\nrelative indifference is caused by ignorance. The<br />\nStudent Council made little effort to inform the<br />\npopulace that election time was drawing near. In<br />\nthe back of our minds is the sickening thought<br />\nthat maybe this year's Council deliberately did<br />\nnot public'ae the upcoming election. We all know<br />\nhow they ramrodded the Constitution through,<br />\nthe student body, but it is inconceivable that<br />\nthey could do the same thing with a hand-picked<br />\ncandidate.

The event<br />\ncan be on a larger scale- a major concert in Shriver Hall- or<br />\nsmaller- a simple coffee house.

Having<br />\nspent some time in the Celville<br />\nRiver Delta on the Arctic slope, I<br />\nnave been exposed to some of<br />\nth..:se complicated situations, for<br />\nexample; the waste of bowhead<br />\nwhales by Eskimos, , tile<br />\n\"inexplicable\" decline of the<br />\nWestern Arctic caribou herd, and<br />\nof course tile controversial<br />\ndevelopment of tne Prudhoe Bay<br />\noil fields.<br />\nGuiliano's review, wane<br />\nb\u201csically accurate, presents two<br />\nsignificant misconceptions.

Relatively few students<br />\nattended, although, tile general<br />\nnature of the speech was geared<br />\nto those who knew little about<br />\nurban policy and nave limited<br />\naccess to tile news media.<br />\nWhat the Secretary presented<br />\nwas a general overview of past<br />\nUrban policy and some of the<br />\nadministration's broad intentions<br />\nfor the future. Her talk, !Uglily<br />\ncolored by political rhetoric,<br />\njabbed at Nixon/Ford cutbacks<br />\nin urban spending, yet excused<br />\nthe present Urban Policy Task<br />\nForce's foot-dragging by asserting<br />\nthat urban policy must be<br />\ncarefully conceived. The Cabinet<br />\nLevel Task Force, representing<br />\nseven departments, carefully<br />\nconceived for a year. Carter<br />\nrejected that policy-in December,<br />\nPlacing the Task Force and Harris<br /><br />\nin a somewhat embattled<br />\nposition.<br />\nA discussion of the problems<br />\nencountered in a policy-making<br />\nprocess involving seven<br />\nautonomous inputs would have<br />\nbeen fascinating, but the political<br />\nrealities of Harris' position<br />\npreclude such frank discussion.<br />\nTne protesters provided the<br />\nonly intellectual stimulation of<br />\nthe evening. The fact that they<br />\nsat down after initially stating<br />\ntheir grievances had very little to<br />\ndo with Harris' glib coercion:<br />\ntheir interest is not chaos, but<br />\ncommunication. Altnough a<br />\nreception was held afterwards to<br />\nallow for questions, tne Secretary<br />\nleft within 15 minutes, apparently<br />\nunable or unwilling to discuss the<br />\nissues raised by the protesters.<br />\nObviously, Harris is not at<br />\nliberty to discuss anything even<br />\nslightly controversial. Engaging<br />\nher to deliver a meaningful<br />\naddress under sucii informal<br />\ncircumstances was a waste of<br />\ntime, effort and University<br />\nmoney. The lecture committee<br />\nmay have believed that having a<br />\nCabinet member speak would<br />\nbring prestige to the University,<br />\nbut Harris' speech worked to the<br />\ndetriment of Hopkins' image.<br />\nTne elementary focus and<br />\npolitical innuendo were insulting<br />\nto most, and her refusal to<br />\ndiscuss HUD issues concerning<br />\nBaltimore was a further snub to<br />\nthe audience.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nSusan C. Williams<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nPlease thank Mr. Shapiro for<br />\nhis thougntful review of<br />\nVolpone.

The<br />\nmore serious scenes, in which<br />\nJonson built his major themes,<br />\nwere played, as written, in a<br />\ndifferent key, as, for instance,<br />\nthe lyrical meeting of Celia and<br />\nVolpone wnere Celia dropped her<br />\n\"stereotype\" and became a more<br />\ndimensional character whom we<br />\ncould credit.

The<br />\nfirst year I was here (as a grad<br />\nstudent), I thought that the<br /><br />\ngraduate students were the<br />\nugliest people I'd ever seen in my<br />\nlife.\" Rebelling against the<br />\nsystem, she socialized with many<br />\nundergraduates, mucn to the<br />\nchagrin of her roommate, a fellow<br />\ngrad student.<br />\nAlthough some graduate<br />\nstudents believe otherwise, Dean<br />\nHooker thinks that the \"two<br />\nstudent bodies wouldn't enjoy it<br />\nif they were brought together.\"<br />\n\"They share the same physical<br />\nspace,\" he notes. \"If they did<br />\nwant to be together, they would<br />\nhave gotten together already.\"<br />\nReflecting on his own graduate<br />\nschool experience, Hooker<br />\nremarks, \"Those worlds are as<br />\ndifferent as night and<br />\nday...Graduate students are<br />\ntotally committed to their<br />\nstudies... It's a day-and-night<br />\nthing for them.\" Hooker thinks<br />\nthat undergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents in 300-level courses<br />\n\"don't mix very well. The<br />\ngraduate students are too<br />\nspecialized and too<br />\nknowledgeable to participate in a<br />\ndiscussion on tile same level with<br />\nundergraduates.\" Hooker views<br />\nthe TA experience as a \"formal<br />\nopportunity (for grad students)<br />\nto share their wisdom.\" He -is<br />\ninterested in \"improving the<br />\nquality of graduate student<br />\nteaching...teaching them to<br />\nteach.\"<br />\nSome graduate students share<br />\nDean Hooker's pessimism about<br />\nthe feasibility of graduate and<br /><br />\nundergraduate students<br />\ninteracting well as classmates. An<br />\nArt History student comments,<br />\n\"It's not possible (for the two<br />\ngroups) to work together. You<br />\nhave to know the material before<br />\nyou can contribute on an equal<br />\nbasis. Undergraduates don't have<br />\nas mucn to offer as graduate<br />\nstudents.\" Other gr,..d students<br />\nare more hopeful. \"In an<br />\nadvanced (foreign language) class<br />\ntaught in(that language),<br />\ngraduate students nave an<br />\nadvantage, but in a class taugnt in<br />\nEnglish, it's different.\" A<br />\nHumanities grad student, taking a<br />\n300-level course tAis semester,<br />\nsees no problem in mixing<br />\nacademically with<br />\nundergraduates. \"It doesn't take<br />\nacademic training to discuss<br />\nliterature. Any classroom is a<br />\ngive-and-take situation. Each<br />\nindividual profits from the class.\"<br />\nAt the undergraduate college he<br />\nattended, an interdisciplinary<br />\ncolloquium on novels written in<br />\nthe 1860's attracted a variety of<br />\nstudents from different fields. He<br />\ndoubts that this would work here<br />\nbecause most graduate students<br /><br />\nhave rigorous requirements in<br />\ntheir own departments. A<br />\nHistory student believes that \"a<br />\nreading seminar could work\" if<br />\nundergraduates were given time<br />\nfor intensive reading. A Writing<br />\nSeminars undergraduate suggests<br />\nan extracurricular<br />\napproach--attending meetings of<br />\nthe \"First Draft\" and \"Tudor<br />\nand Stuart\" clubs.<br />\nAlthough some contact<br />\nbetween Hopkins' graduate and<br />\nundergraduate student<br />\npopulations occurs, the<br />\nuniversity structure discourages<br />\nintellectual and social sharing.<br />\nAccording to The Humanities<br />\nbulletin, \"For the enterprising<br />\nstudent, Hopkins ilas<br />\nopportunities that don't exist<br />\nanywhere else that I know of.\"<br />\nThus, to transcend the<br />\nuniversity's \"permeable walls,\"<br />\nthe \"two student bodies\" must<br />\nmake an effort as individuals to<br />\nmeet each other and to share<br />\ninformation.

He has been involved in many apsects of<br />\nmedical school admissions. In this interview he answers<br />\nsome of the questions most frequently asked by medical<br />\nschool applicants: improving one's chances of being<br />\naccepted from the waiting list, requesting an interview<br />\nwith an admissions committee after being rejected and<br />\nlater gaining acceptance to the same school the following<br />\nyear.<br />\nDr. Gryder is available to personally answer students'<br />\nquestions in Homewood House during most weekday<br />\nafternoons. To make an appointment, students should call<br />\nLinda Garren at 338-7974. A complete text of this<br />\ninterview can be found in Linda Garren's office.<br /><br />\nDr. Gryder: The Preil<br /><br />\nInterviewer: What is the general timetable for<br />\nadmissions to medical school as far as notifications for<br />\ninterviews and acceptances?<br />\nDr. Gryder: It varies tremendously. Some schools start<br />\naccepting very soon after July 1. I guess the first<br />\nacceptances that I heard of last year were in late August.<br />\nAnd then there are some people who are still getting<br />\ninterviews now even though their applications were in a<br />\nlong time ago.<br />\nInt: What is the latest time an applicant should expect<br />\nto hear for inter Dr. Gryder: Last year there were some<br />\npeople who received interviews in June.<br />\nInt: Were these applicants successful in getting in?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I'd have to go back and check exactly but I<br />\nthink some of those were successful.<br />\nInt: What do you do if you are an applicant at this<br />\nstage, and you have only received one interview or have<br />\nnot heard anything at all and have received a few<br />\nrejections?<br />\nDr. Gryder: The person should come to see me.<br />\nSometimes when I talk to the individual I can detect<br />\nthings that may have given a false impression in his ,<br />\ninterviews. These can sometimes be corrected in future<br />\ninterviews and sometimes additional information can be<br />\nsent to schools to compensate for the false impressions.<br />\nInt: Is litere anything the applicant can do to enhance<br />\nhis position on his own?<br />\nDr. Gryder_ That's a little tricky. I don't think it does<br />\nany harm if you contact the school either by phone or<br />\nletter, once in a wiiile, although some schools discourage<br />\nthat. You should not make a pest of yourself.<br />\nInt: Is it advisable to retake the MCAT in April if you<br />\nare still on the waiting list or have not heard anything<br />\nfrom any schools?<br />\nDr. Gryder: If you want to make another attempt and<br />\nyou think that the MCAT is part of the reasoa you stave<br />\nnot gotten in, then, it is a good idea. If you already have<br />\ngood MCAT's then, it is not necessary. Again, I think it is<br />\nbest to see me for each individual case to try to establish<br />\nwhy you are having difficulty.<br />\nInt: Again, if you are an applicant vino has not heard<br />\nanything as yet or have had very few interviews, w.tat else<br />\nIt was Sunday afternoon, and the mindless gang that<br />\nhad kept the Frat party rocking late into the night were<br />\nnow groaning and leaning on the dormitory railing outside<br />\nthe door. Some sat glassy- eyed on the steps, gyrating<br />\nheads resting in pairs of hands. Others were still awake,<br />\nspeeding yet from the previous evening, and dashing back<br />\nand forth across the quad in pursuit of frisbees. One space<br />\npioneer, young Alex, was already busily tripping after his<br />\nusual sabboth hit of micro-dot.<br />\nIt wasn't always this bad the morning after. Usually we<br />\nwould meet in one of our rooms and bong it up--best<br />\nthing in the world for a hangover; Sunday, however, we<br />\nwere dry. Not one of the nine of us had a single speck,<br />\nseed, or step of pot. We sat, groaning in unison, until an<br />\nolder student, maybe a graduate, came whistling towards<br />\nus with a bulging,sack thrown over one shoulder.<br />\nHe made his way through our tangled heap of bodies<br />\nup the steps, turned and asked, \"What the hell is wrong<br />\nwith you guys, you look awful?\"<br />\nIt was our cue; we had a special prayer that we used in<br />\nresponse to such questions during times of such need. We<br />\nscrambled into position \u2022 of such need. We scrambled into<br />\nposition, three rows of three on each of the steps, and<br />\nbegan to sing in parched, cracking cacophony:<br />\n\"Our Father, Who art-in Columbia,<br />\nBlasted be thy brain.<br />\nThy bong be full, thy pipe aflame<br />\nWhen you get fried with Cain.<br />\nGive us this day our daily high,<br />\nAnd forgive us out lung power,<br />\nJust as we forgive those who such down all our reefer.<br />\nLead us not unto a bad trip,<br />\nBut deliver us from narcs,<br />\nFor thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory<br />\nOf agriculture in Columbia.\"\u2022<br />\n\"That was great,\" he told us,\"but why are you hanging<br /><br />\nshould you be doing to protect yourself for the future?<br />\ni.e; what other programs should you pursue during the<br />\none year interval before you re-apply?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think that everyone, not just unsuccessful<br />\n__should have been<br />\nnot just unsuccessful candidates,<br />\nwhat tney<br />\nfreshmen<br />\nthey're<br />\ntime<br />\nthe<br />\nfrom<br />\nconsidering<br />\nmight like to do for a second choice. Sometimes they find<br />\nthey are really more interested in the second choice and<br />\nthen never: apply to medical school. But restricting the<br />\nanswer to your question about someone who in the<br />\nprocess who hasn't heard anything, he should be thinking<br />\nabout his options at this point, trying to discover the<br />\nkinds of rewards he expects from medicine, both<br /><br />\nDr. Gryder\u2014Before<br />\nmonetarily and personally, where else he might make the<br />\ncontributions he wants to make, and the kinds of rewards<br />\nhe wants. He should realistically appraise nis strengths and<br />\nweaknesses. He should have something else in mind that<br />\nhe could do so that he doesn't waste a year bumming<br />\naround, unless he is doing that intentionally because he<br />\nfeels that's the best thing for him. But he shouldn't be<br />\nforced into doing something just because he hasn't gotten<br />\ninto medical school, and there isn't anything to do.Such a<br />\nperson should certainly be considering his options. It<br />\nmight be that he would like to go off and do something<br />\nfor a couple of years and try again. All sorts of<br />\npossibilities exist that would be different for each<br />\nparticular individual.<br /><br />\nInt: Some people say that medical schools seem to like<br />\nthe idea of a student taking a year off and just leaving the<br />\nfield of academics for a while. Is this a good idea?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think tnat depends very much on why<br />\nyou were not accepted the first time. If it was because of<br />\npoor grades, for example, then getting a master's degree in<br />\nsome field is to your advantage if you do well in the<br />\ncourse work. I do think it is different for each person. I<br />\ncan give you examples of people who have been successful<br />\nat getting into medical school doing all sorts of things.<br />\nincluding one who was a taxi driver.<br />\nInt: Are there certain areas of interest in graduate<br />\nprograms that are better to pursue than others!?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think it varies from individual to<br />\nindividual. I really don't think that there is a single<br />\napproach that is universally recommended.<br />\nInt: When an applicant reapplies in the future is there<br />\nanything he should be aware of'?<br />\nDr. Gryder: Yes. The first thing he should be aware of<br />\nis to keep the recommendations committee informed of<br />\nhis plans and to update the information in his files. Many<br />\npeople think they should sort of slink off after they're<br />\nunsuccessful and they are not heard of again until some<br />\ntime in December when they make a telephone call to<br />\nMiss Garren saying, \"Send off the material in my file.\"<br />\nFrequently if they come around and talk to us we can<br />\nmodify the letters, put in something they have done, that<br />\ncompensates for weaknesses in the past, and give a better<br />\npackage to the medical schools. They should keep us<br />\ninformed about what they're doing.<br />\nInt: Then the applicant should obtain additional<br />\nrecommendations from people he has worked with:<br />\nDr. Gryder: Yes, that's right. If he is doing something<br />\nwhich permits someone to find out about him in a<br />\ndifferent way, we can write a more recent letter of<br />\nrecommendation. We'll have to incorporate that in a new<br />\nletter. I know it has helped in some cases.<br />\nInt: Is it advisable for an applicant, who has not been<br />\naccepted the first time around and, has one school in<br />\nparticular he wishes to attend, to request an interview<br />\nwith the admissions committee, after they have made a<br />\nnegative decision, to find out what he can do to enhance<br />\nhis candidacy at that medical school?<br />\nDr. Gryder: That has proven to be successful in some<br />\ncases. Again, I think it depends on the particular medical<br />\nschool in this situation. Some are more receptive to doing<br />\nthat than othels and I think that also changes from year<br />\nto year depending upon who the director of admissions is<br />\nat a medical school. I don't think it does any harm,.<br />\nhowever. In fact, I know some people who were on the<br />\nwaiting list to the very end and then applied early<br />\ndecision at the school even though their credentials were<br /><br />\nHigh Drama: The D<br />\naround singing--enjoy!\"<br />\n\"We can't help it,\" we answered,\"we're straight.\"<br />\nWe didn't know it at the time, but we had been run<br />\ninto by just the right man to end our blues. \"We need<br />\nsome j's\" we began ensemble, \"To cure our daze\" -another favorite chorus.<br />\nHe asked us if we wanted to get high so bad why didn't<br />\nwe make some phone calls and hustle up some weed. We<br />\ntold him that we already had done so, first thing when we<br />\ngot us, but that there weren't any ounces to be had. Not a<br />\nsingle gram of oily hash, not a crystal of cocaine, not even<br />\nan old multi-colored hit of speed was available to get us<br />\nback on track that morning.<br />\nHe told us he had to go see the house-master in<br />\nJennings and then he'd stop back and give us some, er,<br />\nadvice.<br />\nWe all sat us when we saw his head pop through the<br />\ndoor of the dormitory; had he been scoring us some<br />\ndrugs? The student walked past our group, motioning us<br />\nto follow him into the bakment. Going down the stairs<br />\nnine pairs of eyes lit up as their object of vision put tour<br />\njoints into his mouth and put a match to all four.<br />\nWe got high with him for an hour or so, all the while<br />\nreceiving some free advice from a seemingly<br />\nknowledgeable source. He drilled us on search and seizure<br />\nlaws, travelling with drugs, bong- cleaning methods, and<br />\nnumerous other `wheres and whens'. He didn't know that<br />\nwe were taking notes, and he might eveni be angry if we<br />\nlet his secrets be made public, but in the interest of every<br />\nresin-blooded student on campus we have listed a number<br />\nof his key suggestions. While these rules of thumb are by<br />\nno means all-inclusive, we have found them to be<br />\nindispensible at Hopkins' higher altitudes.<br /><br />\nllorkiN\"<br /><br />\nDr. Gryder: If you are on the waiting list you certainly<br />\nwant to keep them informed of your continual interest in<br />\nthe school. This becomes particularly important if you are<br />\non the waiting lists towards tile end of the summer. In the<br />\nbeginning, most schools have their lists (rank ordered),<br />\nand there probably is not much you can do to change tile<br />\norder at the beginning of the summer. As time goes on, if<br />\nthey have some openings towards the end of the summer,<br />\nit becomes much more important to them to fill that<br />\nposition than it is to keep the order they have on the<br />\nwaiting list, and they have decided anyone on the waiting<br />\nlist is acceptable. 8o that as the summer draws to an end<br />\nand you're still on the waiting lists and have not been<br />\naccepted, let them know where you can be reached by<br />\ntelephone 'where somebody is going to answer that<br />\ntelephone day or night. Frequently they will just go down<br />\nthe list until they get the first person who is there. That is<br />\ncertainly a way of increasing your chances of Ibeing<br />\ntaken off the waiting list.<br />\nInt: How should you keep them informed of where<br />\nyou could be reached? Should the applicant talk to the<br />\ndirector of admissions or write a letter?Dr. Gryder:<br />\nProbably not to tne director. This is usually done, I think,<br />\nby the secretary in charge at the end when somebody<br />\ndoes not show up and the director says, \"Get on that<br />\nphone and find somebody.\" Both by letter and phone.<br />\nAgain, not making a pest of yourself but showing that<br />\nyour interest is still there.<br />\nInt: Would a personal visit be useful to help the<br />\nsecretary remember you?<br />\nDr. Gryder: It could be that a personal visit would be<br />\nhelpful, yes.<br />\nInt: Suppose an applicant has a very strong preference<br />\nfor one school in particular, and he has not heard<br />\nanything from them. Should he contact the school?<br />\nDr. Gryder: 1 think if you do it once, that is perfectly<br />\nall right, too. Let them know that it really is your first<br />\nchoice...You are on safer grounds in doing that if you<br />\nhave been accepted someplace else--that there is still<br />\nanother school that is your first choice because I<br />\nthink--and this is just hearsay--but I' m pretty sure that<br />\nsome schools, if .they notice you have been accepted<br />\nsomeplace else, are less likely to give you an offer.<br /><br />\n4ed Survival Course<br />\nnot particularly good. When I say 'not good,'they were from the graduate school he is in. If he has been<br />\nunderhanded with them, it may be harder to pull in<br />\nnot the sort of credentials that one would normally say an<br />\nwho is willing to write a good letter. If he has<br />\nsomeone<br />\nthey<br />\nbecause<br />\nbut<br />\nchance<br />\na<br />\nhad<br />\napplicant<br />\nearly de,ision<br />\ntalked with them' and let them know they were still gone to the graduate school with their realizing that he<br />\nplans to complete some degree program and then apply to<br />\ninterested arid, put on the waiting list till the end, they<br />\nschool, they have a better feeling about it and are<br />\nmedical<br />\nyear.<br />\nfollowing<br />\nwere taken early decision for the<br />\nmuch more likely to write a good letter for him when<br />\nInt: They were advised to apply early decision?<br />\nhe applies to medical school later.<br />\nDr. Gryder: Yes.<br />\nInt: If the applicant is interested in pursuing his<br />\nInt: Suppose the senior applying to medical school has<br />\nan excellent fall semester. Should he personally notify the interest in chemistry in the meantime, doesn't he hurt his<br />\nmedical schools or should he let somebody do it for him? chances of getting into a graduate program when he states<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think it's best if he lets someone else do that he is still interested in medicine?Dr. Gryder: I think<br />\nit for him. If he is not having good success I think it is<br />\nbetter. if it comes from someone else who can add<br />\nadditional comments other than just the grades. Sending<br />\nthe grades provides another excuse for bringing the<br />\ncandidate to the attention of the -committee.<br />\nInt: Should that someone else be a faculty member or a<br />\nperson on toe Pre-Medical Recommendations Committee?<br />\nDr. Gryder: I think it is better if he is on the Pre-Medical<br />\nRecommendations Committee because that person has<br />\naccess to what was said before. I can recall some cases in<br />\nwhich people had a bad semester just before the letter was<br />\nwritten. Then the person writing the letterwould say that<br />\nthe earlier years were indicative of his true ability. Then,<br />\nif this person comes out with a particularly strong<br />\nsemester later, we can refer back to the letter and say,<br />\n\"See, I was right.\" If you get to know someone well after<br />\nthe recommendation has been sent, have the letters sent<br />\nto the Committee to be forwarded to the schools.<br />\nInt: What does it mean to be placed on a medical<br />\nschool's waiting list?<br />\nDr. Gryder: That varies from school to school, but sort<br />\nof as a rule of thumb it means that your chances at that<br />\nschool are somewhere between one in three and one in<br />\ntwo of being accepted. So if you are on several waiting<br />\nlists your chances are pretty good that you'll pick up on<br />\none of them. Unfortunately, that could be the day classes<br />\nDr. Grvder\u2014After<br />\nstart, so you really do not know if you're going to go to<br />\nmedical school or not if you're on several waiting lists<br />\nuntil sometime in September, which, going to the it will make it harder for him to get into graduate school<br />\nPrevious question about what you should do in the event but, not impossible. I think anybody who has a record<br />\nyou don't get into medical school, makes it very difficult that is ever going to get him into medical school is going<br />\nfor planning. Something I don't recommend is to go to to beable to get into graduate school. Maybe not his first<br />\ngraduate school without letting the graduate school know choice graduate school, but I think that is less important<br />\nYou are still a pre-med, for two reasons. One, it is sort of should his ultimate goal still really be to go to medical<br />\nunfair to the graduate school. We, in chemistry, last year school. There are some people who should really change<br />\nlost somebody on the first day of classes because he got their minds. I'm not suggesting that everyone should<br />\npicked up by a medical school. But aside from being re-apply. But, if he certainly is re-applying I don't think it<br />\nunfair to the graduate school, I think it's also unfair to will cause any difficulties.<br />\nInt: What can an applicant who is on the waiting list do<br />\nthe student in the event he isn't picked up that year<br />\nenhance his credentials?<br />\nto<br />\n1<br />\nrecommendatim3<br />\nof<br />\nletter<br />\na<br />\nwant<br />\nto<br />\ngoing<br />\nbecause he is<br /><br />\ng Scene At Hopkins<br />\nPi<br />\nAT \u2022<br />\nAvsi\u2022<br />\nWAS<br /><br />\n,.)0.,ED<br />\nQ<br /><br />\nS<br />\nV\" '<br />\nANJCE-1<br /><br />\n\u00b0Never buy pot on a Baltimore street, especially on the<br />\nBlock. The problem is not the chance of arrest, rather it is<br />\nthe likelihood of purchasing the dealer's own secret<br />\nmixture of sawdust and sand. The safest drugs are on<br />\ncampus.<br />\n2)If you must sell dope, never sell to non-students you<br />\ndon't know. It only takes one bust.<br />\n3)The safest place to smoke is home.

Make sure to mark the size of each<br />\nhit taken as :Wimp, lightweight, mediocre, regular,<br />\npremium, super-regular, lung-buster, professional, Hoover,<br />\nor Eureka.<br />\n5)Never clean your bongs in the bathroom sinks. Who<br />\nup with pipe tar and bong-stench while<br />\nwants to put<br />\nthey're shaving? There are plenty of custodial wash<br />\nclosets which can be used; if your custodian objects you<br />\ncan use \"Frannie's House\"\u2014 third floor Lazear near the<br />\ndoor to Jennings. Long as you clean up, \"Frannie t'ain't<br />\nbe mindin\".<br />\n6)Never smoke joints on the platforms at the Baltmore<br />\ntrain station waiting for trains. The Amtrak Red-Cpas,<br />\nwhose eyes are usually more red than their caps, will<br />\nswoop down on you, assume a voice of authority, and<br />\n\"confiscate that illegal-smelling cigarette\"; it is<br />\nextinguished and placed in a tin box with any others<br />\nfound until the end of the shift.<br />\nIf you have to smoke on a train, wait until the train is<br />\nmoving, then blow a quick joint between cars, keeping<br />\none open for the conductors and the other for a chick<br /><br />\nInt: So, in other words, getting into another place<br />\ncould hurt you?<br />\nDr. Gryder: To some extent. I think this is a secondary<br />\nproblem, and I think some schools do not pay any<br />\nattention to it, but I think that some do not give offers,<br />\nand particularly should you be interested in a school<br />\nwhich on paper looks inferior to one you have been<br />\naccepted in. Then I think it is very important that you let<br />\nthem know that you still want to go for it.<br />\nInt: Snould the applicant state during the interview<br />\nthat the school is his first choice?<br />\nDr. Gryder: As long as it conies out as sincere on youi<br />\npart. You don't do it just because you think it is going to<br />\nincrease your chances at a given school. I think it's usually<br />\ntransparent.<br /><br />\nwho's looking to get high.<br />\n7)If you're ever caught smoking by a Baltimore cop,<br />\nthere are three options, the choosing of which will<br />\ndetermine whether it's a simple head rush or a two-year<br />\nsentence. a) If he's over thirty-five, whip out your<br />\nHopkins I.S., say you didn't know what jio\u2014UW-efe doing,<br />\nand offer him a shoe shine; b) If he's under thirty-five,<br />\ndon't show him your I.D. He's liable to be jealous and do<br />\nan extra good job of frisking you. Instead, offer him a<br />\ncouple of tokes, which is probably all he was after<br />\nanyway; c) If you're too high to tell how old he is, you<br />\nmight as well not fight it; you'll probably laugh through<br />\nthe whole thing.<br />\n8)For the hard core, commandment number eight goes<br />\nwithout saying, but it is sound advice for the drug-initiate.<br />\nKeep Visine handy. For the time that you can't resist a<br />\nfew bongs before class or work, Visine is supreme. Don't<br />\nforget;it's when one's eyes are red that one is high.<br />\n9)Pay no attention to marijuana's color in shopping<br />\naround. Light does tricky things, and so do bleach, red<br />\nink, dyes and haircoloring.<br />\n10) If you're ever caught- smoking by a campus cop,<br />\nlaugh. He's not going to bother you unless you're smoking<br />\n'destructive' marijuana-- braking chairs -iver piles of<br />\nbodies, or trash. Unless you cause an awful lot of trouble,<br />\nyou have a certain amount of freedom of choice that<br />\ndoesn's exist anywhere but on 'college campuses-- where<br />\npeople who don't get high seem to enjoy pondering the<br />\npossibilities as much as people who do.

Their<br />\nlatest production, Tennessee Williams' The Night of the<br />\nIguana, represents a poor effort on the part of all. Why<br />\nthis dull play was ever chosen in the first place is beyond<br />\ncomprehension, but its weaknesses, too glaring for even<br />\nthe most professional company to overcome, render this<br />\nproduction almost laughable. It certainly offers no<br />\naesthetic or intellectual satisfaction.<br />\nDr. Edward Berkeley, handicapped from the start with<br />\nthis mediocre script, saddled himself with unskilled<br />\nactors, allowed Set Designer Peter Harvey to run totally<br />\namuck with fluorescent paint and cardboard, pawed<br />\nthrough Goodwill's ten cent record collection for the<br />\nincidental music, and then had the ,nerve to present this<br />\nmess to an audience of unsuspecting octogenarians in the<br />\nhope they would like it. And the saddest part is, they<br />\nprobably did. The critics sure did.<br />\nThe play itself is full of cliches,. ethnic slurs and<br />\nstereotypes. It lacks poignancy, humor and message. I had<br />\ntrouble even finding a theme to latch on to. Only one<br />\ncharacter seems real and deserving of our attention. The<br />\nrest are transparent bores who for the most part stand<br />\naround trying to look like they belong on a steamy<br />\nMexican veranda in 1940. They are expected to be hot and<br />\nfrustrated, as most of Williams' characters are, but there is<br />\nno evidence of true feeling or motivation, nor even a<br />\nsense ot that intangible known as stage presence.<br />\nOur hero, Shannon, is a real let-down. His character is<br />\nso poorly defined that we can't decide whether to love or<br />\nto hate him. Not that we care--he is presented as a victim<br />\nof jungle fever (and that's not alp\u2014but it is only when the<br />\nlines remind him that he remembers to act nauseous and<br />\nlethargic. And even then he is unconvincing. Janet Sarno<br />\nas Maxine, the touch chick who runs the motel at which<br />\n[he action takes place, takes her role far too seriously. She<br /><br />\ncomes across as the ultimate in sexy bitchiness, and plays productions this season, The Rivals and The Runner<br />\nit to the hilt. Every wink, every twitch of the hip, is Stumbles. The season's opener,The Goodbye People, was<br />\nnot a success, but it wasn't a disaster like this one. Maybe<br />\npredictable.

By Penelope Gilliatt. 147 pp. Coward,<br />\nMcCann and Geohegan. $7.95.<br /><br />\nBY MIKE GIULIANO<br /><br />\nPenelope Gilliat<br /><br />\nPenelope Gilliatt, a film critic for The New Yorker, has<br />\nalso written short stories and novels, as well as tile<br />\nscreenplay for Sunday Bloody Sunday, whicit received a<br />\nnomination for an Academy Award. Splendid Lives, her<br />\nnew collection of nine short stories, could be labelled a<br />\ncollection of transatlantic stories, because so many of<br />\nthem are set in England and America.Her own life is split<br />\nbetween New York, London and tile Continent, so it's<br />\nnot surprising butt her fiction often deals with the<br />\nproblems of jet-set life. \"Fleeced\" is the story of a boy<br />\nabandoned on a tropical island by his jet-set parents. In<br />\n\"Autumn of a Doormouse,\" a grandmother and ner<br />\ngrandson make 37 round trips, on a daily basis, from New<br />\nYork to Rome. These are unusual problems, but Gilliatt's<br /><br />\n,naracters are usually wealthier, better educated and more<br />\neloquent than the average person.<br />\nAlong with their greater wealth and verbal facility<br />\nthere's<br />\nalso a good deal of eccentricity, as if Gilliatt, like<br />\nIP<br />\nso many English writers before her, is determined to<br />\nprove that no one is more eccentric than an Englishman.<br />\nThis eccentricity, however, is- admirable. Their lives are<br />\nsplendid lives. The main character in toe title story, for<br />\ninstance, is the Bishop of Hurlingham, who at 92 recalls<br />\nhis pre-World War I imprisonment for aiding suffragettes,<br />\nall the while cutting into nis quail pie and plotting new<br />\nmischief. The grandmother in \"Autumn of a Dormouse\"<br />\nsums up Gilliatt's attitude towards eccentricity rather<br />\nnicely: \"people will tell us we're eccentric, but everyone's<br />\neccentric when you get to know them, thank<br />\ngoodness.\"<br />\nAlthough none of these stories is splendid, they do<br />\ncontain a wealth of splendid, eccentric characters, woo<br />\nare preoccupied witii transatlantic interests and worries,<br />\nand woo are confronted, as in \"Iron Larks,\" with the fact<br />\nthat \"French toast is<br /><br />\nPAGE 16 / MARCH 10, 1978<br /><br />\nNONDENOMINATIONAL'<br />\nOFFICE OF THE<br />\nThe<br />\nCHAPLAIN<br />\n6unday<br />\nprzesents<br />\nExperience\\,_<br /><br />\n(MoOds Foa Goeo'<br />\nDR.

After<br />\nstudying the paintings, assemblages and environmental<br />\ndisplays of such artists as Max Ernst, Rene Magritte and<br />\nSalvador Dali, the twenty students enrolled in the class<br />\nwere required to submit either a paper or a conceptual art<br />\nproject in which they exercised their knowledge of the<br />\nprinciples underlying surrealist art. The suggested project,<br />\nwhich was the more popular alternative, was to show in a<br />\ncareful drawing or collage how one could drastically<br />\nchange a conspicuous building, monument or public place<br />\nin Baltimore so as to surprise passersby, divert them from<br />\ntheir customary tasks and thoughts and prompt<br />\nassociative thinking. The project was to be accompanied<br />\nby a text explaining the creation's subversive effect and<br />\nmeaning. Of the students who submitted projects, more<br />\nthan half decided to metamorphose a building on or near<br />\ncampus. Here are some of their rather sensational results:<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nwhich actually, seemed to suggest a camera. The top of<br />\nthe museum was triangular, so (almost) was the top of a<br />\ncamera. The semi-cylindrical portions of the museum's<br />\nfacade suggested body parts of a camera too. The student<br /><br />\n'More than<br />\nhalf decided to<br />\nmetamorphose<br />\na building........\"<br />\nadded a shutter release and a winding button to her<br />\ndrawing and the museum's transformation into a camera<br />\n\"was complete.\" Not yet satisfied, she decided to change<br />\nthe columns at the museum's entrance and, in order to<br />\nobtain a surprising and original idea, she asked a friend<br />\nwhat \"column\" spontaneously suggested to him. He<br />\nthought of newspaper columns; she used that association<br />\nin her picture. Finally, she substituted a gigantic broken<br />\nflashcube for the Duchamp-Villon sculpture at the steps<br />\nleading up to the Museum of Art. She is confident that if<br />\nher idea were ever fully realized, it would cause passersby<br />\nto stop dead in their tracks, forget tneir daily<br />\nbusiness\u2014and wonder.<br />\nWhat would be the poetic meaning of her building?<br />\nAmong other things Ms. Anderson feels that a<br />\ncamera-shaped museum would cause people to reflect on<br />\nthe nature of art. Like film in a camera, paintings and<br />\nsculptures in a museum mirror the world which<br />\nexists outside its walls.<br />\nAnother student's project was more cynical:<br /><br />\nOther students proposed: to transform Johns Hopkins<br />\ncampus into a colossal sterile chamber supplied with<br />\noxygen from a tank in Gilman Hall; to transform Mudd<br />\nHall, tne new biology building, into an Erlenmeyer flask;<br />\nto replace the sculpture in front of the MSE Library with<br />\na gargantuan rubber snowboot; to transform Shriver Hall<br />\ninto a living organism supported by human limbs; to<br />\ntransform the bronze sculpture in tile center of Charles<br />\nCenter Plaza into a nuge blown fuse or a beating heart; to<br />\ntransform the Peabody Library into a graveyard<br />\nenvironment where subway vents in the floors were<br />\nwindows on graves and archways, and bookcases<br />\nsuggested hidden images of skulls; to balance the World<br />\nTrade Center precariously on a pyramid symbolic of<br />\nthe American dollar; and to nave the vertical shaft of the<br />\nWashington Monument seized by a colossal nand. Two<br />\nstudents made familiar sights in Baltimore, tile MSE<br />\nLibrary and the U.S.S. Constellation, the focus of an<br />\ninner drama and the manifest content of a dream.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nThe starting point for the composition was a broken<br />\nflashcube which the student noticed and picked up in<br />\nfront of the museum. She claims tnat at first she could<br />\nnot identify it and admired it solely for its mystery. After<br />\nshe realized what it was, it occurred to her tnat perhaps<br />\none would surprise people and stimulate associative<br />\nthinking if one were to transform the building in front of<br />\nwhich she found the flashcube, the Baltimore Museum,<br />\ninto an object that the flashcube suggested to her--a<br />\ncamera. The transformation of the museum entrance into<br />\na colossal camera lens indeed seemed rather startling.(We<br />\ntend to perceive museum entrances as benign and passive<br />\nthings--gateways to look at and pass through; the<br />\nsubstituted lens would be bewildering because<br />\nnon-ingressible, frightening, and suggestive of an unknown<br />\npresence watching). Moreover, the association of camera<br />\nand museum brought out several features of the museum<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nMEMO41M14141.1\u202214<br /><br />\nThe shape of Garland Hall spontaneously suggested a<br />\ncash register to this student who feels that that<br />\nassociation is just \"in light of increasing tuition costs.\" At<br />\nthe top of his building, transformed into a money<br />\nmachine, is a row of nines stretching across the entire<br />\nwidth to indicate that \"the University,just like any other<br />\nbusiness, is trying to make as large a profit as it possibly<br />\ncan.\" (The nines suggest that, he explains, because, for<br />\nany given number of digits, the greatest numerical value is<br />\nobtained by repeating nines).<br />\nNot content with only one interpretation for Garland<br />\n(he was aware of the surrealist fondness for multiple<br />\nimagery), he discovered that if the streets around Garland<br />\nwere considered as a continuous configuration and<br />\nobserved from an area between Ames and Latrobe Halls,<br />\nthey suggested an anthropomorphic figure whose arms<br />\nand legs are formed by the streets. According to the<br />\nstudent, this robot represents a pre-med student. The<br />\nstethoscope and scalpel in tae two front windows of the<br />\nbuilding which suggest the robot's eyes represent the<br />\npre-med's burning ambition and sole purpose for<br />\nexistence: to become a doctor. The ears of this pre-med<br />\nhave been left out purposely to emphasize tile desire and<br />\nthe robot-like head underscores it. Like a robot, lie<br />\nclaims, a pre-med student is programmed-4cademically<br />\nprogrammed--to do only one tiling (be a doctor). A<br />\nsignificant number of pre-med students, however, are,<br />\nunfortunately, unable to nandle their program; they find<br />\nthe course load too much and are forced to drop their<br />\npre-med studies. Like the nines which flash on in an<br />\nelectronic calculator's digits display wnen the calculator's<br />\nsystem is overloaded, the nines flashing at the top of tile<br />\npre-med student's head allegedly represent an overload.<br />\nHe is no longer in tne running; the proverbial \"axe\" has<br />\nfallen on him.
