It was at<br />\nthe time when a wave of feeling against frosh rules was spreading<br />\nthroughout the country.<br />\nThen came the historic Annihilation of Annapolis. The story of<br />\nthat struggle has been told and retold so often that it is needless to<br />\ndwell upon it further. That event probably did more to ameliorate<br />\nthe harshness of freshman regulations and the consequent fights than<br />\nany other single event. For when the Class of '30 became sophomores<br />\nthey checked paddling and the first step toward the abolition of freshman regulations was accomplished.<br />\nBut the new system worked very, very badly. The regulations were<br />\nsupposed to be obeyed, but there was nobody to enforce them. Theoretically the plan was perfect, practically it proved to be a dismal<br />\nfailure. The road was clear; either the old paddles would have to be<br />\nrenovated or the regulations abolished in toto. This year witnesses<br />\nthe solution; and the correct one, we feel sure.<br />\nBefore praising .the new system, we must first see what the old<br />\nintended to accomplish. In the first place, freshman regulations were<br />\nintended to teach the yearlings their proper place, and it did so undoubtedly. Yet anyone who takes the trouble to review his own freshman days (or daze) can realize that no regulations were necessary to<br />\nkeep him in his place. The average freshman can see exactly how<br />\nunimportant he is. The faculty with its eternal \"No admittance to<br />\nthis course,\" and \"Keep out of here,\" furnishes a far better example<br />\nthan even the most hardened member of a sophomore pep-committee.<br />\nAnd if freshmen are still unconvinced by their instructors, fraternities<br />\ncertainly leave no doubt in their minds. Of course, rushing season has<br />\nthe opposite effect, but once the little button is securely fastened, the<br />\n.attitude changes. We know of no better cure for a superiority complex<br />\nthan a bucket of soapy water, a rag, and a nice, dirty floor.<br />\n<br />\ncan college student. Modern moving pictures, novels and plays contautly depict our college students<br />\ns irresponsible and immoral young<br />\nmen, who have no regard for the<br />\nordinary conventions of life. If<br />\none really looks into the matter, he<br />\nwill find that in most cases the<br />\n1 uthors of these fallacious writings,<br />\n, re people who have had no college<br />\n,education and have not even gone<br />\n,to the trouble of investigating the<br />\n1 ictual situation in the American<br />\nuniversities. If they had looked<br />\nnto the matter more deeply they<br />\ncould have discovered that the<br />\ni verage student today is a conscienious, sane-minded person who is<br />\ntriving toward some definite goal,<br />\nc nd is usually willing to sacrifice a<br />\nI reat deal, in order to make this<br />\noal a realization. If some of these<br />\nI eople, who criticize so severely,<br />\n( ould only be given the chance to<br />\ni bserve the work of some of our<br />\nA lopkins pre-medical and engineerng students, they would perhaps<br />\n-hange their ideas considerably. I<br />\nt ke our University merely as an<br />\nc %ample, for I feel sure that at<br />\n( ther universities the story is excicily the same. Of course there are<br />\nc lways exceptions to a rule, but I<br />\n,, ust say that in general there should<br />\nt e a general emancipation of the<br />\n4 merican student in the minds of<br />\nhe American public.<br />\n* * * *<br />\n<br />\n. Acting upon the copy-book maxim that misery loves company, it<br />\nwas thought that regulations tended to bind the freshmen closer together. We believe that vigorous enforcement of regulations did have<br />\nthis salutory effect, but the same result can be accomplished by a close,<br />\nwell-knit class organization. The freshman class-officers will have to<br />\nfind a substitute for the old-fashioned manner of bringing the yearlings into close contact with each other.<br />\nIn two respects, however, the new system falls a little short of the<br />\nmark. The frosh should wear some distinguishing insignia, such as a<br />\nbutton, to help them get acquainted with each other. The theory that<br />\n\"you can tell them apart, anyhow,\" is quite erroneous in a number of<br />\ninstances. Then, too, the freshmen should be made to greet every<br />\nman they pass on the campus. The cheery \"Hello,\" that used to welcome the undergraduate everywhere is misssd. It created a certain<br />\ncamaraderie that built up a splendid atmosphere of congeniality.<br />\nMany friends were made by that ruling and we view its departure<br />\nwith the feeling that an old and worthy tradition has passed away.<br />\nStill and all, the Student Council is to be heartily congratulated on<br />\nthe abolition of freshman regulations. After all, they were childish.<br />\n<br />\nAn old grad at the University of<br />\n1Vermont laments the passing of the<br />\n1 ood old days when the fists of<br />\nc ollege students were used for<br />\nt hings other than manipulating a<br />\nencil. He declared \"the city is unt sually quiet for the first college<br />\nN -eek of the year.\" He claimed that<br />\nI,when he was in college, havoc<br />\nreigned during the first week, classe s being held only if there were any<br />\nsurvivors. In those days \"there<br />\n-ere no lights on the campus and<br />\nI obody hesitated to paste his antagonist one if the occasion offered<br />\ni self.

It was at<br />\nthe time when a wave of feeling against frosh rules was spreading<br />\nthroughout the country.<br />\nThen came the historic Annihilation of Annapolis. The story of<br />\nthat struggle has been told and retold so often that it is needless to<br />\ndwell upon it further. That event probably did more to ameliorate<br />\nthe harshness of freshman regulations and the consequent fights than<br />\nany other single event. For when the Class of '30 became sophomores<br />\nthey checked paddling and the first step toward the abolition of freshman regulations was accomplished.<br />\nBut the new system worked very, very badly. The regulations were<br />\nsupposed to be obeyed, but there was nobody to enforce them. Theoretically the plan was perfect, practically it proved to be a dismal<br />\nfailure. The road was clear; either the old paddles would have to be<br />\nrenovated or the regulations abolished in toto. This year witnesses<br />\nthe solution; and the correct one, we feel sure.<br />\nBefore praising .the new system, we must first see what the old<br />\nintended to accomplish. In the first place, freshman regulations were<br />\nintended to teach the yearlings their proper place, and it did so undoubtedly. Yet anyone who takes the trouble to review his own freshman days (or daze) can realize that no regulations were necessary to<br />\nkeep him in his place. The average freshman can see exactly how<br />\nunimportant he is. The faculty with its eternal \"No admittance to<br />\nthis course,\" and \"Keep out of here,\" furnishes a far better example<br />\nthan even the most hardened member of a sophomore pep-committee.<br />\nAnd if freshmen are still unconvinced by their instructors, fraternities<br />\ncertainly leave no doubt in their minds. Of course, rushing season has<br />\nthe opposite effect, but once the little button is securely fastened, the<br />\n.attitude changes. We know of no better cure for a superiority complex<br />\nthan a bucket of soapy water, a rag, and a nice, dirty floor.<br /><br />\ncan college student. Modern moving pictures, novels and plays contautly depict our college students<br />\ns irresponsible and immoral young<br />\nmen, who have no regard for the<br />\nordinary conventions of life. If<br />\none really looks into the matter, he<br />\nwill find that in most cases the<br />\n1 uthors of these fallacious writings,<br />\n, re people who have had no college<br />\n,education and have not even gone<br />\n,to the trouble of investigating the<br />\n1 ictual situation in the American<br />\nuniversities. If they had looked<br />\nnto the matter more deeply they<br />\ncould have discovered that the<br />\ni verage student today is a conscienious, sane-minded person who is<br />\ntriving toward some definite goal,<br />\nc nd is usually willing to sacrifice a<br />\nI reat deal, in order to make this<br />\noal a realization.

I<br />\nt ke our University merely as an<br />\nc %ample, for I feel sure that at<br />\n( ther universities the story is excicily the same. Of course there are<br />\nc lways exceptions to a rule, but I<br />\n,, ust say that in general there should<br />\nt e a general emancipation of the<br />\n4 merican student in the minds of<br />\nhe American public.<br />\n* * * *<br /><br />\n. Acting upon the copy-book maxim that misery loves company, it<br />\nwas thought that regulations tended to bind the freshmen closer together. We believe that vigorous enforcement of regulations did have<br />\nthis salutory effect, but the same result can be accomplished by a close,<br />\nwell-knit class organization. The freshman class-officers will have to<br />\nfind a substitute for the old-fashioned manner of bringing the yearlings into close contact with each other.<br />\nIn two respects, however, the new system falls a little short of the<br />\nmark. The frosh should wear some distinguishing insignia, such as a<br />\nbutton, to help them get acquainted with each other. The theory that<br />\n\"you can tell them apart, anyhow,\" is quite erroneous in a number of<br />\ninstances. Then, too, the freshmen should be made to greet every<br />\nman they pass on the campus. The cheery \"Hello,\" that used to welcome the undergraduate everywhere is misssd. It created a certain<br />\ncamaraderie that built up a splendid atmosphere of congeniality.<br />\nMany friends were made by that ruling and we view its departure<br />\nwith the feeling that an old and worthy tradition has passed away.<br />\nStill and all, the Student Council is to be heartily congratulated on<br />\nthe abolition of freshman regulations. After all, they were childish.<br /><br />\nAn old grad at the University of<br />\n1Vermont laments the passing of the<br />\n1 ood old days when the fists of<br />\nc ollege students were used for<br />\nt hings other than manipulating a<br />\nencil.

What with the<br />\ncomplete absence of the aforementioned this year, undoubtedly the<br />\nupperclassmen will still bring up<br />\nthe subject.<br />\nThe \"Y\" Handbook gives an interesting page or two to the describing of what will be required this<br />\nyear of the freshmen, and composing the largest class since the University was threatened with the New<br />\nPlan. Freshmen are advised that<br />\nthey should carry out these extremely few regulations to the n'th degree<br />\nor face the consequences. These are<br />\nto be found at the top of page thirtyfive.<br />\nAll joking (?) aside we wish to<br />\npersonally advise the new men that<br />\n\"Attendance at the weekly assemblies * * * is the only duty imposed\"<br />\nis also the bunk. \"We know students who never attended any assembly and they never were susFended, etc., etc.\" One should attend one or two of them just for<br />\nfun, however.<br />\nThis policy probably is the answer<br />\nto the complaints of those \"letterwriters\" of last year who insistently<br /><br />\ndemanded that the regulations be<br />\ncompletely enforced or dropped altogether. Since the latter has happened; and this article has been<br />\nwritten forstalling such, not more<br />\nthan six hundred and six letters<br />\nwill be written this year.<br />\nOn one hand we have the plaudits<br />\nof those who are glad to see tlic.<br />\nlast remnants of childishness vanish<br />\nfrom the campus and on the other<br />\nhand we have the howls of anguish<br />\nof those who hate to see the passing of the last traditions of the good<br />\nold days when there was really such<br />\na thing known as college spirit.<br />\nPerhaps the first group contains<br />\nthe majority.
