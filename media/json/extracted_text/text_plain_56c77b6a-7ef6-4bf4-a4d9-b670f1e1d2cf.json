Of the whole group, nine<br />\nspecies are valuable as food-fishes, *but rather on<br />\naccount of quantity than quality. None suffer more<br />\nfrom the want of protection than these fishes. They<br />\ninhabit the upper waters of all our streams, and are<br />\ncut off in thousands by every mill-dam on the many<br />\nsmaller and larger creeks in the country. Their<br />\nenormous productiveness (some deposit at one time<br />\n500,000 eggs) does not make up for this in the case<br />\nof any particular stream from which they may have<br />\nbeen finally driven.
