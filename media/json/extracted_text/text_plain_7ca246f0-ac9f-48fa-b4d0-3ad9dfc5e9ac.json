The policy of the University<br />\nwith regard to additIona! parking<br />\nfacilities on the north side of the<br />\ncampus is \u2022governed by the ultimate use to which the area is to<br />\nbe put. In accordance with the<br />\npresent developments, the north<br />\nside of the campus is to be a residential area and all efforts are<br />\nnow being turned toward keeping<br />\nthis section of the campus as<br />\nquiet as possible, which necessitates that all vehicular traffic be<br />\nheld to a minimum. The construction of the additional parking facilities on the north side of the<br />\ncampus is not consistent with University policy and therefore the<br />\nCommittee hesitates to recom-<br />\n<br />\nsion after it has had a chance to<br />\nstudy the survey of the Levering<br />\nHall parking area.<br />\n5.

It is suggested that the Student Council enlist the cooperation of the student body: on a voluntary basis for<br />\nsuch a proposal.<br />\n7.

To call this a<br />\nnaive betrayal of anti-capitalist<br />\nsentiments is hardly beyond the<br />\npale of reasonable conjecture.<br />\nDuring the first few weeks of<br />\nhis residence with them, the Domars noted the following quirks in<br />\nHector's behavior: (1) uncanny<br />\nfear of going up and down steps;<br />\n(2) refusal to enter the kitchen;<br />\n(3) refusal to enter the bathroom; (4) intense hatred and mistrust of policemen.<br />\nAn explanation put forth by<br />\none school of thought is that Hector, a creature of foreign extraction (Germany, it is well known,<br />\nwas the couch of Nazism and the<br />\ncradle of the communist prophet),<br />\nwas markedly unused to the<br />\nsimple, capitalist luxuries of life:<br />\nautomobiles, kitchen sinks, bathtubs, the very commonplaces of<br />\nour free .society.

From<br />\nour point of view, however, attributing subconscious motivations to a mere dog does not seem<br />\neither wholesome or realistic.<br />\nWe here rest our case, temporarily. Met with the stubborn refusal of Hector to cooperate, halted by his tendency to answer evasively, we have tried to be unbiased.

The policy of the University<br />\nwith regard to additIona! parking<br />\nfacilities on the north side of the<br />\ncampus is \u2022governed by the ultimate use to which the area is to<br />\nbe put. In accordance with the<br />\npresent developments, the north<br />\nside of the campus is to be a residential area and all efforts are<br />\nnow being turned toward keeping<br />\nthis section of the campus as<br />\nquiet as possible, which necessitates that all vehicular traffic be<br />\nheld to a minimum. The construction of the additional parking facilities on the north side of the<br />\ncampus is not consistent with University policy and therefore the<br />\nCommittee hesitates to recom-<br /><br />\nsion after it has had a chance to<br />\nstudy the survey of the Levering<br />\nHall parking area.<br />\n5. The Committ:e agrees to revise future printing of the parking<br />\ntickets to accommodate the Student Council in its enforcement<br />\nprocedures.<br /><br />\n6. The Committee lKsitates to<br />\naccept this recommendation of the<br />\nStudent Council and points out<br />\nthat the problem of enforcement<br />\nwould be impossible. It is suggested that the Student Council enlist the cooperation of the student body: on a voluntary basis for<br />\nsuch a proposal.<br />\n7. The Committee is forced to.<br />\nreject this proposal of the Student<br />\nCouncil, pointing out that the<br />\nexisting fire regulations and campus traffic flow requirements dictate strict enforcement of the (attic'<br />\npus road \"No Parking\" regulamend it.<br />\n2.

To call this a<br />\nnaive betrayal of anti-capitalist<br />\nsentiments is hardly beyond the<br />\npale of reasonable conjecture.<br />\nDuring the first few weeks of<br />\nhis residence with them, the Domars noted the following quirks in<br />\nHector's behavior: (1) uncanny<br />\nfear of going up and down steps;<br />\n(2) refusal to enter the kitchen;<br />\n(3) refusal to enter the bathroom; (4) intense hatred and mistrust of policemen.<br />\nAn explanation put forth by<br />\none school of thought is that Hector, a creature of foreign extraction (Germany, it is well known,<br />\nwas the couch of Nazism and the<br />\ncradle of the communist prophet),<br />\nwas markedly unused to the<br />\nsimple, capitalist luxuries of life:<br />\nautomobiles, kitchen sinks, bathtubs, the very commonplaces of<br />\nour free .society.

From<br />\nour point of view, however, attributing subconscious motivations to a mere dog does not seem<br />\neither wholesome or realistic.<br />\nWe here rest our case, temporarily. Met with the stubborn refusal of Hector to cooperate, halted by his tendency to answer evasively, we have tried to be unbiased.
