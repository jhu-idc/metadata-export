Summing up the duties of a<br />\ngood college to itself and its undergraduates is the statement that \"If our colleges can succeed in producing<br />\ngraduates with a sense of mission, a deep, annoying<br />\nconscience about the social ills of man, and the courage<br />\nto help correct them, then higher education will have a<br />\nstrategic place in society so long as man has problems<br />\nto be solved.\"<br />\nWhat catches our eye immediately is the concern<br />\nwith the \"social ills of man\" and their correction. Such<br />\n\"social awareness\" is characteristic of the generation<br />\nwhich grew up in the twenties and thirties. They have<br />\nbeen accustomed from their youth to think of the world<br />\nin terms of social phenomena involving masses of men;<br />\nthe \"sense of mission\" in society is central to their approach to life. Thus they have castigated our own generation because we seem uninterested in the problems<br />\ncurrently facing society as a whole, in such things as<br />\nintegration and Peace.<br />\nWhat is not generally appreciated is that the profound social consciousness of previous generations has<br />\ngiven way to an equally profound, often anguished, self<br />\nconsciousness. The deepest musings of today's undergraduate tend to an examination of himself rather than<br />\nhis society. His concern is not to make a worthwhile<br />\nsociety, but to make himself what he considers a worthwhile human being. Perfecting the group has become<br />\nsecondary to perfecting the individual.<br />\nEvidence for this change in undergraduate thinking<br />\nis the books he reads. Recent favorites have been Lord<br />\nof the Flies and the writings of J. D. Salinger, works<br />\nhich deal with the essential nature of the human<br />\nanimal. Such social dramatists as Sinclair Lewis are<br />\ngenerally regarded as trivial and out of date. We all<br />\nknow Babbit; we do not much like him, and we see no<br />\npoint in anatomizing him at any length. Also, campus<br />\npolitical activity has, in general, declined\u2014despite the<br />\nobvious vitality of C.O.R.E. et al. A Communist speaker<br />\nor a debate on Cuba arouses real interest but no fervor.<br />\nEven the thunder on the right cannot match the<br />\ncacaphony from the other end of the political spectrum<br />\nwith which our fathers were famiilar.<br />\nWe make no claims for the originality of this self<br />\nconsciousness, it had engendered an extensive literature<br />\nlong before we were born; nor will we attempt to defend<br />\nit. We simply point out that this generation is different<br />\nand that the social and political activities of the first<br />\nhalf of the century have given us the Bomb and the<br />\nWall with no more adequate compensation than color<br />\ntelevision.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking of Institutions<br />\nThe official opening, last week, of the Goucher College Center marks an exciting addition to the suburban<br />\ncultural setting and indicates how beneficial a privately<br />\noperated institution can he to the community in which it<br />\nis situated.<br />\nWhile the center will provide greater cultural and<br />\nsocial facilities for Goucherites, its serviceability to the<br />\nsuburban community of Baltimore demonstrates the role<br />\nwhich educational institutions can play in the marketing<br />\nof culture to their geographically contiguous neighbors.<br />\n<br />\nJuvenes Dum Sumus<br />\nCornelius Lee Grove, DSRC president, has supplied<br />\nthe News-Letter with a relentlessly prepared report (see<br />\npage 1) of the semester operations of the efficacious<br />\ndormitory council.

(The first gravest problem is of<br />\ncourse, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house<br />\ncanaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority<br />\nfeelings and their possible cures.<br />\nPsychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal<br />\ncategories:<br />\n1. Physical inferiority.<br />\n2. Mental inferiority.<br />\n3. Financial inferiority.<br />\n(A few say there is also a fourth category: ichthyological<br />\ninferiority\u2014a feeling that other people have prettier fish\u2014<br />\nbut I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the<br />\nGreat Lakes area.)<br />\nLet us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps<br />\nthe easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined to feel<br />\ninferior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful homecoming queen. But we should not. Look at all the people,<br />\nneither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their marks in<br />\nthe world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates. Look at<br />\nCaesar. Look at Lassie.<br />\n<br />\nre are &Titled'6/eeliffbiars<br />\n<br />\nWhat I mean is that you can't always tell what's inside a<br />\npackage by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course, you<br />\ncan. Take Marlboro Cigarettes, for example. Just one glance<br />\nat that jolly red-and-white package\u2014so bright and pert \u2014 so<br />\nneat but not gaudy\u2014so perfectly in place whether you are at<br />\na formal dinner or a beach picnic\u2014so invariably correct for<br />\nany time, clime, or condition\u2014one look, I say, at this paragon<br />\nof packs and you know it has to contain cigarettes of absolute<br />\nperfection. And you are right! That pure white Marlboro<br />\nfilter, that fine, flavorful blend of Marlboro tobaccos, will<br />\ngive you a smoke to make the welkin ring, whatever that is.<br />\nSo those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your<br />\nMarlboro packs since the beginning of the semester, why don't<br />\nyou open a pack and light one? Light a cigarette, I mean\u2014<br />\nnot the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your<br />\nMarlboro and, at the same time, continue to gaze rapturously<br />\nat the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are if<br />\nthat is possible.)<br />\nBut I digress. Let us turn now to the second category\u2014<br />\nmental inferiority. A lot of people think they are dumber than<br />\nother people. This is not so. It must be remembered that there<br />\nare different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and Sturbridge, students at Wake Forest. It was always assumed that Claude was<br />\nthe more intelligent just because he knew more than Sturbridge about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the humanities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten<br />\ntimes smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny knots.<br />\nBut no matter; everybody looked down on \"Stupid Sturbridge,\"<br />\nas they called him and looked up at \"Clever Claude,\" as they<br />\ncalled him. But who do you think turned out to be the smart<br />\none when their granny almost got loose and ran away? You<br />\nguessed it\u2014good old Stupid Sturbridge.<br />\nWe arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.<br />\nOne way to deal with this condition is to increase your income.<br />\nYou can, for example, become a fence. Or you can pose for a<br />\nlife class, if your college is well heated.<br />\nBut a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept<br />\nit philosophically. Look on the bright side of poverty. True,<br />\nothers may have more money than you have, but look at all<br />\nthe things you have that they don't\u2014debts, for instance, and<br />\nhunger cramps.<br />\nAnd what about friendship? You don't need money to have<br />\nfriends, and let me tell you something, good people: the older<br />\nyou get the more you will realize that nothing is so precious as<br />\nfriendship, and the richest man in the world is the one with<br />\nthe most money.<br />\n<br />\ne 1965 Max %tames<br />\n<br />\nRich or poor, you can all afford the pleasure of Marlboro1<br />\navailable at popular prices in all 59 slates of the Union.<br />\n<br />\n\fBermuda Trip<br />\nTentative flight scheduled<br />\nto Bermuda for Spring vacawith<br />\nproject<br />\njoint<br />\ntion;<br />\nGoucher.

Part of the<br />\nreason for last year's disappointing 4-16 season was the foul as<br />\nat least five games were decided<br />\nagainst the Jays in this fashion.<br />\nThus far this season, coach Ross<br />\nSachs has been trying to keep<br />\nhis boys from fouling, and has<br />\nfor the most part, been successful. However, this old bugaboo<br />\nshowed up again in the last two<br />\ngames as more than twenty were<br />\ncalled against the hoopsters, altogether. Washington College<br />\nconverted 19 of 27 chances and<br />\nWestern Maryland hit on 9-,17.<br />\nThe WM conversions probably<br />\nwas a great factor in a game<br />\nthat went to them by a 55-49<br />\nscore. Hopkins garnered but 5<br />\npoints via the foul line. In the<br />\nWashington College game, the<br />\nJays converted 20-28 to offset<br />\ntheir great number of fouls.<br />\nThe Western Maryland game<br />\nplayed last Wednesday night<br />\nproved to be a defensive battle<br />\nas the score stood at a low 55-49.<br />\nHopkins led at the half time<br />\nbreak 24-23 on a good team effort, as the score was tied many<br />\ntimes.

Business Mgr<br /><br />\n-----<br /><br />\nHoward Maniloff<br />\nMurray Cohen<br />\n-Bruce Copeland<br />\nJeff Diver<br /><br />\nOut Of The Dust<br />\nThe January 19 issue of the Saturday Review contains a thoughtful article on the challenge facing higher<br />\neducation in America. Summing up the duties of a<br />\ngood college to itself and its undergraduates is the statement that \"If our colleges can succeed in producing<br />\ngraduates with a sense of mission, a deep, annoying<br />\nconscience about the social ills of man, and the courage<br />\nto help correct them, then higher education will have a<br />\nstrategic place in society so long as man has problems<br />\nto be solved.\"<br />\nWhat catches our eye immediately is the concern<br />\nwith the \"social ills of man\" and their correction. Such<br />\n\"social awareness\" is characteristic of the generation<br />\nwhich grew up in the twenties and thirties. They have<br />\nbeen accustomed from their youth to think of the world<br />\nin terms of social phenomena involving masses of men;<br />\nthe \"sense of mission\" in society is central to their approach to life. Thus they have castigated our own generation because we seem uninterested in the problems<br />\ncurrently facing society as a whole, in such things as<br />\nintegration and Peace.<br />\nWhat is not generally appreciated is that the profound social consciousness of previous generations has<br />\ngiven way to an equally profound, often anguished, self<br />\nconsciousness. The deepest musings of today's undergraduate tend to an examination of himself rather than<br />\nhis society. His concern is not to make a worthwhile<br />\nsociety, but to make himself what he considers a worthwhile human being. Perfecting the group has become<br />\nsecondary to perfecting the individual.<br />\nEvidence for this change in undergraduate thinking<br />\nis the books he reads. Recent favorites have been Lord<br />\nof the Flies and the writings of J. D. Salinger, works<br />\nhich deal with the essential nature of the human<br />\nanimal. Such social dramatists as Sinclair Lewis are<br />\ngenerally regarded as trivial and out of date. We all<br />\nknow Babbit; we do not much like him, and we see no<br />\npoint in anatomizing him at any length. Also, campus<br />\npolitical activity has, in general, declined\u2014despite the<br />\nobvious vitality of C.O.R.E. et al. A Communist speaker<br />\nor a debate on Cuba arouses real interest but no fervor.<br />\nEven the thunder on the right cannot match the<br />\ncacaphony from the other end of the political spectrum<br />\nwith which our fathers were famiilar.<br />\nWe make no claims for the originality of this self<br />\nconsciousness, it had engendered an extensive literature<br />\nlong before we were born; nor will we attempt to defend<br />\nit. We simply point out that this generation is different<br />\nand that the social and political activities of the first<br />\nhalf of the century have given us the Bomb and the<br />\nWall with no more adequate compensation than color<br />\ntelevision.<br /><br />\nSpeaking of Institutions<br />\nThe official opening, last week, of the Goucher College Center marks an exciting addition to the suburban<br />\ncultural setting and indicates how beneficial a privately<br />\noperated institution can he to the community in which it<br />\nis situated.<br />\nWhile the center will provide greater cultural and<br />\nsocial facilities for Goucherites, its serviceability to the<br />\nsuburban community of Baltimore demonstrates the role<br />\nwhich educational institutions can play in the marketing<br />\nof culture to their geographically contiguous neighbors.<br /><br />\nJuvenes Dum Sumus<br />\nCornelius Lee Grove, DSRC president, has supplied<br />\nthe News-Letter with a relentlessly prepared report (see<br />\npage 1) of the semester operations of the efficacious<br />\ndormitory council.

(The first gravest problem is of<br />\ncourse, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house<br />\ncanaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority<br />\nfeelings and their possible cures.<br />\nPsychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal<br />\ncategories:<br />\n1. Physical inferiority.<br />\n2. Mental inferiority.<br />\n3. Financial inferiority.<br />\n(A few say there is also a fourth category: ichthyological<br />\ninferiority\u2014a feeling that other people have prettier fish\u2014<br />\nbut I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the<br />\nGreat Lakes area.)<br />\nLet us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps<br />\nthe easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined to feel<br />\ninferior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful homecoming queen. But we should not. Look at all the people,<br />\nneither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their marks in<br />\nthe world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates. Look at<br />\nCaesar. Look at Lassie.<br /><br />\nre are &amp;Titled'6/eeliffbiars<br /><br />\nWhat I mean is that you can't always tell what's inside a<br />\npackage by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course, you<br />\ncan. Take Marlboro Cigarettes, for example. Just one glance<br />\nat that jolly red-and-white package\u2014so bright and pert \u2014 so<br />\nneat but not gaudy\u2014so perfectly in place whether you are at<br />\na formal dinner or a beach picnic\u2014so invariably correct for<br />\nany time, clime, or condition\u2014one look, I say, at this paragon<br />\nof packs and you know it has to contain cigarettes of absolute<br />\nperfection. And you are right! That pure white Marlboro<br />\nfilter, that fine, flavorful blend of Marlboro tobaccos, will<br />\ngive you a smoke to make the welkin ring, whatever that is.<br />\nSo those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your<br />\nMarlboro packs since the beginning of the semester, why don't<br />\nyou open a pack and light one? Light a cigarette, I mean\u2014<br />\nnot the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your<br />\nMarlboro and, at the same time, continue to gaze rapturously<br />\nat the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are if<br />\nthat is possible.)<br />\nBut I digress. Let us turn now to the second category\u2014<br />\nmental inferiority. A lot of people think they are dumber than<br />\nother people. This is not so. It must be remembered that there<br />\nare different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and Sturbridge, students at Wake Forest. It was always assumed that Claude was<br />\nthe more intelligent just because he knew more than Sturbridge about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the humanities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten<br />\ntimes smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny knots.<br />\nBut no matter; everybody looked down on \"Stupid Sturbridge,\"<br />\nas they called him and looked up at \"Clever Claude,\" as they<br />\ncalled him. But who do you think turned out to be the smart<br />\none when their granny almost got loose and ran away? You<br />\nguessed it\u2014good old Stupid Sturbridge.<br />\nWe arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.<br />\nOne way to deal with this condition is to increase your income.<br />\nYou can, for example, become a fence. Or you can pose for a<br />\nlife class, if your college is well heated.<br />\nBut a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept<br />\nit philosophically. Look on the bright side of poverty. True,<br />\nothers may have more money than you have, but look at all<br />\nthe things you have that they don't\u2014debts, for instance, and<br />\nhunger cramps.<br />\nAnd what about friendship? You don't need money to have<br />\nfriends, and let me tell you something, good people: the older<br />\nyou get the more you will realize that nothing is so precious as<br />\nfriendship, and the richest man in the world is the one with<br />\nthe most money.<br /><br />\ne 1965 Max %tames<br /><br />\nRich or poor, you can all afford the pleasure of Marlboro1<br />\navailable at popular prices in all 59 slates of the Union.<br /><br />\nBermuda Trip<br />\nTentative flight scheduled<br />\nto Bermuda for Spring vacawith<br />\nproject<br />\njoint<br />\ntion;<br />\nGoucher.
