With the<br />\nsplendid engineering facilities and<br />\nthe extensive ground at Homewood, Professor Tilden and his<br />\nassistants will be able to conduct<br />\nthe course with a satisfying degree<br />\nof completeness. While the course<br />\nis not limited to engineering students, it presupposes a working<br />\nknowledge of plane geometry and<br />\ntrigonometry. The classes have<br />\nbeen set tentatively for Tuesday<br />\nfrom 4 to 6 P. M. and Saturday<br />\nmorning.<br />\nIn the general orders issued<br />\nlast week another important step<br />\nwas taken toward the ultimate<br />\n\"hundred per cent. efficiency\"<br />\nwhich Major Guild has set as the<br />\ngoal for the Hopkins battalion.<br />\nProvision was made for the officers and non-commissioned officers of the battalion to get training in the rank above them. To<br />\nthis end, the captains will, on<br />\nspecified occasions, act as battalion commander; the lieutenants<br />\nwill be given regular opportunities to command their companies;<br />\nthe adjutant will exchange places<br />\nwith a company first lieutenant,<br />\nand the sergeant-major and the<br />\nduty sergeants will have similar<br />\nopportunities to learn one another's duties. In this way, the<br />\nefficiency of the battalion will be<br />\nraised by the fact that whenever<br />\na man is promoted he will be familiar with the duties of his new<br />\nstation.<br />\nIn his first lecture for this term,<br />\ndelivered last Thursday, Major<br />\nGuild made it clear that orders<br />\ndelivered by him \"mean business.\"<br />\nHe stated that the utter irresponsibility shown by a small group<br />\nof men in neglecting to attend<br />\ndrills and in disregarding orders<br />\nhas caused him,with the backing of<br />\nthe University authorities, to es<br />\ntablish a system of demerits. Fifty demerits the first semester or<br />\nsixty the second will cause a man<br />\nto be dropped from the course in<br />\n<br />\nThe first battalion dance, given<br />\nlast Friday evening in the lecture<br />\nhall of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding, was a brilliant success.<br />\nThe dance was all that Hopkins<br />\nheart could desire; in the words<br />\nof a former opponent of the battalion dance plan, it had the \"old<br />\ncotillions beat a mile.\"<br />\nEvery man was in uniform.<br />\nMr. Kistler, the man who has made<br />\nthese dances possible, remarked to<br />\nthe writer, \"I want to make that<br />\nuniform the swellest full-dress outfit that can appear at Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe dance was distinctly a battalion dance; civilians were absolutely tabooed. Even the chaperones\u2014Mrs. Guild, Mrs. Abercrombie and Mrs. Kistler\u2014have more<br />\nthan a passing interest in the<br />\ncorps.<br />\nThe battalion dances and the<br />\ninter-company athletics are part<br />\nof a carefully worked out plan,<br />\noriginating with Theodore Kistler,<br />\nJohns Hopkins physical instructor, and backed by Major Guild<br />\nand Dr. Abercrombie, which was<br />\nfirst announced several weeks ago.<br />\nWhile the scheme is expected to<br />\nconfer many lesser benefits on the<br />\nstudent body, its ultimate goal is<br />\nthe increased efficiency of the battalion. The dances are expected<br />\nto bring out a spirit of battalion<br />\npride and good fellowship among<br />\nthe men; while the inter-company<br />\nathletics are intended to produce<br />\ncompany rivalry, and incidentally<br />\nto benefit the men physically. In<br />\nMr. Kistler's own words, \"Work<br />\nhard and play hard\u2014that's efficiency.\"<br />\nIf the enthusiastic co-operation<br />\nshown thus far by the students is<br />\nany indication, the plan is already<br />\na brilliant success, according to<br />\nMr. Kistler. The three inter-company football games already<br />\nstaged on Straus Field have been<br />\nfar from the jokes that many<br />\nfeared they would be. Right from<br />\nthe start the brand of football exhibited, while possibly not scientific, has at least been very spirited, and, in the opinion of its backers, it promises big things for the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nAccording to the expressed<br />\nopinion of a large number of the<br />\nundergraduates, the introduction<br />\nof general athletics and a common<br />\nsocial interest is one of the greatest events in the history of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins and Haverford last<br />\nSaturday battled through a<br />\nwretched game of football, characterized by fumbles and rough<br />\nand erratic playing on both sides,<br />\nto a scoreless tie. The showing of<br />\nthe 'Varsity on Saturday, after its<br />\nbrilliant victory over Western<br />\nMaryland and \u2022 the snappy practices of last week, was a bitter disappointment to Hopkins followers.<br />\nThe Homewood machine, which<br />\nhas improved steadily since the<br />\nDickinson game of unpleasant<br />\nmemory and seemed to be at its<br />\nhighest point of development, underwent a deceidedly downward<br />\nreversal of form. There was not<br />\nthe slightest trace of a scoring<br />\npunch in the Hopkins machine,<br />\nand\u2014unless the .Black and Blue<br />\nstages a phenomenal comeback in<br />\nthe immediate future\u2014the outlook<br />\nfor bringing the State championship to Homewood is extremely<br />\ndark.<br />\nHaverford succeeded in playing<br />\nas poorly as Hopkins, but should<br />\nhave scored a touchdown in the<br />\nthird period, when she had the<br />\nball just one foot from the Hopkins goal line had not Brennick's<br />\ncharges stood off in stonewall<br />\nfashion the vicious plunges of the<br />\nQuaker backs.<br />\nThere were several brilliant<br />\nplays, sufficiently isolated to have<br />\nno effect on the scoring, that stand<br />\nout in the otherwise indifferent<br />\nplay of the local team. Captain<br />\nWoodward caught two long forward passes from Winslow, which<br />\ngained, respectively, 20 and 40<br />\nyards. On the defensive Woodward threw the Haverford<br />\n' backs<br />\nfor frequent losses and hard falls;<br />\nhis work was the redeeming feature of his team's play. Sheffey<br />\ngave a beautiful exhibition of<br />\nbroken field running (when he<br />\ndodged his way through the Main<br />\nLine team for 35 yards, and Winslow got away for a 25-yard run<br />\nafter receiving one of Leonard's<br />\npunts. But the team as a whole<br />\nseemed overconfident or indifferent, did not work together, made<br />\ncostly blunders, made no interference worthy of the name and consistently fell gown in the pinches.<br />\nHopkins made its best attempt<br />\nto score in the first period when<br />\nWinslow's place-kick from the 32yard line missed the middle of the<br />\ncross-bars by inches. Hopkins outplayed its opponents during this<br />\nstage of the game, but the punch<br />\nwas not there when they came<br />\nwithin scoring distance. Winslow<br />\n<br />\nmilitary training and force him to<br />\ntake the whole period over again<br />\nbefore he may get a University<br />\ndiploma.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued \u00f4i page 6, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nMaking Ready for St. John's.<br />\nBy COACH BRENN1CK<br />\n<br />\nOn Saturday the annual game<br />\nwith Haverford was played at that<br />\ncollege and for the first time since<br />\nrelations were established our<br />\neleven came out of the contest undefeated. The game itself was a<br />\nslow, deliberate time-consuming<br />\nprocess, for Haverford seemed<br />\nbent on conserving her resources<br />\nfor the Swarthmore game. None<br />\nthe less she had her usual good<br />\nteam and was much stronger than<br />\nour men had anticipated. Hopkins had not altogether recovered<br />\nfrom the strain of the Western<br />\nMaryland game, which, since it<br />\nwas our first State championship<br />\ngame, took more of the men than<br />\nwas generally suspected. It was,<br />\ntherefore, somewhat natural that<br />\nthe team should have let down to<br />\nsome degree, but this letting down<br />\nwas so marked that it almost resulted in defeat.<br />\nThe one saving factor of the contest is the fact that the men themselves realize that they did not<br />\nplay up to the limit of their powers, and this realization makes one<br />\nfeel that now that the slump is<br />\nover better things may be expected. At any rate, better things<br />\nmust be done if we are to defeat<br />\nSt. John's. This team from Annapolis is making steady progress<br />\nand is, of course, pointing its game<br />\nfor us, and if we hope to win we<br />\nmust work for improvement in<br />\nseveral branches of the game.<br />\nThe team as yet, with the exception of the drive in the Western Maryland game, has not developed a \"punch\" sufficient to<br />\nscore on a team like St. John's or<br />\nMaryland State. One must remember that a good offense is the<br />\nbest defense,for the offensive team<br />\npossesses all the rights of initiative and all freedom of action. It<br />\nis absolutely necessary, therefore,<br />\nthat this week see a marked development in the power with<br />\nwhich the team carries the ball.<br />\nIn our interference, likewise, we<br />\nmust see improvement. In practice, against our own men, the<br />\nbacks leave their feet and take out<br />\nthe proper opponent, but it seems<br />\nthat, once in a contest, the backs<br />\nfeet are glued to the ground. On<br />\nthe whole, the line played well at<br />\nHaverford, for it more than held<br />\nits own, so that, granted normal<br />\ngrowth, its power should be effective in our final games.<br />\nThe real acid test comes Saturday when St. John's comes to<br />\nHomewood. One hears much of<br />\nSt. John's spirit, but it is much<br />\nto be doubted if they are one whit<br />\nsuperior to our men in this regard, for we have as game an<br />\neleven as _ ever represented Hop(Continued on page 10, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 19, 1917.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\nBesides, the reputation of an old-established firm is<br />\nback of each sale with a guarantee.<br />\n<br />\nJohn C.

Twelve<br />\nmonths passed ; a team representing Hopkins was unable to win a<br />\nsingle significant game.

One class went out between the years, three remained,<br />\na new class came in which has<br />\nproved itself fully up to the standard. Yet one year our athletics<br />\nwere \"fine\"; the next, \"rotten.\"<br />\nOur physical worth must certainly have been about the same for<br />\nboth years, good, bad or indifferent, whatever it may really have<br />\nbeen; yet one year we said our<br />\nathletics were \"fine\"; the next<br />\n\"rotten.\" Could both estimates<br />\nhave been true? Isn't it reasonable to suppose that in the average<br />\nour standing, whatever it may be,<br />\nremains about the same?<br />\n. There is something wrong, then,<br />\nwith our standards of judgment.<br />\nIf eleven specialists from St.<br />\nJohn's defeat eleven of our specialists on the gridiron, we say<br />\nthat athletics at Hopkins are in<br />\na fearful state; and, moreover,<br />\nthat St. John's is our superior in<br />\nathletics. But what are we judging from? The athletic performance of less than five per cent, of<br />\nour number, if we allow for all<br />\nsubstitutions. That's science for<br />\nyou!<br />\n<br />\nA Tribute.<br />\n<br />\nIn looking over the editorial<br />\ncolumns of a NEWS-LETTEROf about<br />\na year ago we find this sentence:<br />\n\"Hopkins has not awakened; the<br />\nspirit which carried our team<br />\nthrough to the winning of the<br />\nState championship last year has<br />\nbeen lost; the student body, in the<br />\nsupport of its team, is in a state<br />\nof apathy.\"<br />\nFor most of us the deplorable condition of affairs at Homewood that brought forth this rebuke is an only too vivid memory.<br />\nThe situation was a peculiar one.<br />\nCollege traditions and college<br />\nspirit must be somehow inseperably bound up with and dependent<br />\nupon environment; for when the<br />\nJohns Hopkins undergraduates<br />\nwere lifted bodily from their old<br />\nquarters to the beautiful new ones<br />\nat Homewood, these invaluable attributes seemed to be utterly lost.<br />\nThe general attitude toward football and college activity generally,<br />\nwas a sort of tolerant apathy,<br />\nmaddening to those who had<br />\nworked so hard for the building<br />\nup of Hopkins traditions and<br />\nHopkins spirit.

I arrived here (El<br />\nPasso, Texas) on the twenty-ninth<br />\nof August and have been most<br />\nhopelessly busy ever since. The<br />\nSi h Engineers (mounted) is one of<br />\nthe two mounted engineer battalions in the Regular Army, the<br />\nother being the 9th Battalion,<br />\nwhich is stationed next door to<br />\nus. Our actual location is Camp<br />\nStewart, which is about three<br />\nmiles from the big army post, Fort<br />\nBliss. Plain sand, mosquito brush,<br />\nan occasional prairie dog and the<br />\nburrows and several variations of<br />\ncactus constitute our foreground<br />\nscenery. The background is a little better. The mountains rise up<br />\non our west and north sides and<br />\nafford the one solace to the country's general appearance.<br />\nYou can imagine my feelings<br />\nupon reading the telegram assigning me to a regular battalion of<br />\nengineers, but they were somewhat<br />\ndampened when I realized that I<br />\nwas joining a mounted outfit located in Texas, the home of the<br />\ncowpuncher and where everyone<br />\nlearns to ride before attempting<br />\nto walk. And I was detailed to<br />\nact as a mounted officer to such<br />\nan organization! Ye gods! But<br />\nI was quite a worried person for<br />\nsome time, particularly as I always did fancy motorcycles and<br />\npreferred them to the uncertain<br />\ndisposition and personal equation<br />\nthat is present in a horse. But I<br />\ndiscovered that there were a few<br />\nother reserve officers assigned to<br />\nthe 8th and also found that they<br />\nwere in the same predicament; so,<br />\nof course, that helped immensely.<br />\nFor a full three weeks we went<br />\nthrough the horrors of learning<br />\nhow to ride and I can assure you<br />\nthat learning to become a military<br />\nhorseman on a McClellan saddle<br />\nis not a plush cushion siesta by<br />\nany means. But at last we have<br />\npassed that ordeal.<br />\nAbout two weeks ago the major<br />\ncalled all the officers of the battalion together and we rode out to<br />\nthe foothills where the major had<br />\nselected a spot for.the erection of<br />\n<br />\na simple trestle timber bridge.<br />\nSpan was 60 feet and the material<br />\navailable was given us. From the<br />\nabove data he asked for individual<br />\nplans to be submitted by each officer in three days. I worked a<br />\nproposition up based almost entirely on the good old reliable \"My<br />\n= If\" formula (I had no technical<br />\nbooks). I remembered \"I\" for<br />\nbd3<br />\nrectangle to be \u2014 and the \"f\"<br />\n12<br />\nfor yellow pine (the timber we<br />\nused)- was given us. The bridge<br />\nwas to be constructed for a threeton truck, which amounts to about<br />\n15,000 pounds. I turned mine in<br />\nand at officers' call three days<br />\nlater the major proclaimed mine<br />\nto stand Al. I was certainly<br />\ntickled because it was practical<br />\nwork done without reference and<br />\nyou can bet I thanked heaven for<br />\nthe several hours spent some time<br />\nback on C. E. I. Of course I had<br />\nthe slight advantage over ;he officers as I am the \"kid\" in the battalion and consequently fresh from<br />\ncollege. Another thing I am most<br />\nthankful for is the time I spent<br />\non learning to letter. E was given<br />\nthe job of taking care of the company fund in may company. It<br />\nhappened that the man who kept<br />\nit before me was a captain from<br />\nthe \"Point\" and his work was in<br />\nit most horrible scrawl,so I thought<br />\nI'd best let him know that we have<br />\nsome things that they don't teach<br />\nat the Academy, and I put my<br />\ntabulations down in my best printing. It was time well spent, for<br />\nwhen the books were inspected, as<br />\nthey are each quarter, 1 received<br />\nanother little boost, and you know<br />\nseveral boosts make a shove and<br />\neach shove is just that much<br />\nnearer one silver bar.<br />\nDon't imagine I am anything of<br />\na horseman yet.

Waldo Newcomer was the<br />\neditor-in-chief who wrote its foreword:\"The Class of '89 is about to<br />\nleave the college halls and go forth<br />\ninto the world,\" feeling \"fully prepared to join the graduates coming from other colleges to dazzle<br />\nthe world in its ignorance by the<br />\nlight of their own superior wisdom.\" There, too, you read the<br />\nsame jokes; find the dean and<br />\n\"Tommy\" Ball the same objects of<br />\nveneration; there the same class<br />\ncontests; the same compulsory hygiene lectures; you learn that in<br />\n'88 \"the Hopkins boys faced the<br />\nfield and gave the 'rah-rah-rah.<br />\nHopkins'\"; in 1888\u2014<br />\nFreshmen hastening to and fro,<br />\nWith looks of misery and woe.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the interesting features<br />\nof the book is the page containing<br />\nthe football scores of the year '88:<br />\nHopkins, 6; Kendall College, 4.<br />\nHopkins, 0; St. John's, 6.<br />\nHopkins, 0; Princeton, 104.<br />\nHopkins, 54; Univ. of Md., 0.<br />\nHopkins, 26; Duponts, 0.<br />\nHopkins, 6; Baltimore Club, 0.<br />\nHopkins, 0; Charter, 12.<br />\nHopkins, 26; Navy, 12.<br />\nHopkins, 10; Univ. of Pa., 24.<br />\nHopkins, 26; Univ. of Va., 0.<br />\nHopkins, 6; St. John's, 12.<br />\n<br />\nIt is evident here, however, time<br />\nhas worked great changes, both for<br />\nbetter and for worse. Navy was at<br />\nthat time a frequent victim of<br />\nHopkins' prowess; and, as noted<br />\nabove, in '88 Hopkins defeated the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia by the score<br />\nof 26 to 0; but on the other hand<br />\nthe Black and Blue played St.<br />\nJohn's for five years before scoring a first victory in 1889.<br />\nThe extent of public interest is<br />\ndoubtless best indicated by the<br />\nnewspapers of the day. On the<br />\nWednesday succeeding a game\u2014<br />\nwhich, by the way, seemed to be<br />\nHopkins' newspaper day\u2014if the<br />\ngame had been important locally,<br />\nthe Sun or the American would<br />\nperhaps give an account in some<br />\ndetail. The great outof-town<br />\ngames of other colleges sometimes<br />\nreceived mention. The advance<br />\nwrite-ups were short and sweet\u2014<br />\nand naive; for instance, on October 28, 1888, appears this brief notice: \"Next Saturday the Johns<br />\nHopkins football team will go up<br />\nto Princeton for their regular annual licking.\"<br />\nToward the middle of 1888, however, the Sun apparently secured<br />\nan enterprising sporting editor,<br />\nand he started a real sporting column; and that year three games<br />\nreceived his particular attention,<br />\nof which the Baltimore Club game<br />\nwas the best reported. The Baltimore Club, as you will read below,<br />\nwas composed of \"the daintiest<br />\nyoung fellows in town,\" many of<br />\n<br />\nball had to be returned to the middle<br />\nof the field. Another series of scrimmages occurred when the Baltimore<br />\nClub was hemmed in to prevent interference, and Dashiell made a long run,<br />\nlaying C. Riggs low before going to<br />\nthe grass himself. The battle was<br />\nfought to within two yards of the<br />\nBaltimore goal line, when the first inning was over without a point being<br />\nscored on either side.<br />\nThe second inning again opened with<br />\nthe Baltimores on the strong run for<br />\nthe Hopkins line. The rushline of the<br />\nlatter gave way before the daring onslaught, and Poe, with the ball in his<br />\narms and surrounded by his team, was<br />\npushed by main force twenty yards.<br />\nHe was tackled in time and in about<br />\nthree seconds ten of the daintiest<br />\nyoung fellows in town were piled in<br />\nsuch a confused mass upon the sward<br />\nthat it seemed doubtful if they would<br />\ncome out each with his own limbs.<br />\nHopkins secured the ball and in their<br />\n\"snap-off\" Dashiell and Whitelock made<br />\na pretty play by which the latter got<br />\na good run, followed by a scrimmage<br />\nand a run by Fearn, who was neatly<br />\nstopped by Fullback Julius Dashiell, at<br />\nthe cost of taking a butting square in<br />\nthe pit of the stomach.<br />\nHopkins then went in for blood\u2014<br />\nand they got it.

The<br />\nClifton days were big days; an<br />\neight-horse bus for a two mile ride<br />\nto a more than presentable field<br />\nbeside the mansion house.<br />\nI was much surprised to learn<br />\nthat thete were few mass plays in<br />\n1888.

In each case .there<br />\nhas been a captain and three other<br />\nspeakers, and a quartet has also<br />\nbeen taken along each time to provide the music.<br />\n\"When I first knew that millionaire, he was a boy watering cows<br />\nand horses on a farm.\"<br />\n\"Doing the same thing now, except he is watering stock in *all<br />\nStreet.\"\u2014Ex.<br />\nin until the '90's, nor did the \"revolving wedge.\" The \"turtle back\"<br />\nconsisted of the whole team,locked<br />\nhalf standing, the man with the<br />\nball in the center; when it seemed<br />\nin danger of being broken up, it<br />\nsplit to let the man with the ball<br />\ndart out. The \"revolving wedge\"<br />\nwas a variation of this; the men<br />\nlocked shoulder to shoulder and<br />\nrevolved as soon as struck. The<br />\nmost approved fashion of stopping<br />\nthis was to have a heavy man dive<br />\nunder the advancing play, while.<br />\nsimultaneously, some one else<br />\nhurdled the first row and landed<br />\non top of the man with the ball.<br />\n(Meantime, I presume, the man<br />\nunderneath had to remain there\u2014<br />\nand pray!)<br />\nProtective padding was also an<br />\ninnovation of the '90's.

Leonard dropped back for<br />\na punt that traveled -40 yards and<br />\nthen bounced down the field for 40<br />\nmore. That play stirred Hopkins<br />\nmomentarily and they reeled off<br />\ntwo first downs in rapid succession, Jones gaining 16 yards and<br />\nShelley 10. But that exhausted<br />\nthe driving power of the Black<br />\nand Blue, and Woodward was<br />\nforced to punt. A few minutes<br />\nafterward, Winslow ran back<br />\nLoanard's punt to Haverford's 25yard line, but a bad pass on the<br />\nnext play, gave the ball to the<br />\nQuakers.<br />\n\u2022 In the second half,. Haverford<br />\nt veled 40 yards down the field at<br />\nbreakneck speed ; the Hopkins line<br />\nmade a stand and Carey turned<br />\nthe tide to the favor of the Black<br />\nand Blue when he recovered the<br />\nball by catching a blocked punt.<br />\nSheffey plunged through the line<br />\nfor two 4-yard gains, and Jones<br />\nmade it first down. End runs<br />\ngained nothing and Woodward<br />\npunted once more. Schmidt was<br />\nright on the job when Fitts fumbled the kick and recovered the<br />\nball. The Quaker line held and<br />\nWinslow essayed one more placekick. This time the Red and<br />\nBlack forwards broke through,<br />\nblocked the kick and carried the<br />\nball 20 yards down the field.<br />\nThis was the impetus that started Haverford on an auspicious<br />\nmarch to all but a touchdown. A<br />\nforward pass from DeWees to<br />\nBrown netted 20 yards. DeWees<br />\nskirted the end for 13 more and<br />\nLeonard went through the line for<br />\n7, placing the ball on Hopkins' 5yard line. It called forth the supreme strength of the Hopkins defense to prevent a touchdown, and<br />\n1<br />\n2they made good in spite of a 2/<br />\nyard penalty. Haverford backs<br />\nhit the line three times only to be<br />\nthrown back, and after a forward<br />\npass was grounded for a touchback, Hopkins took the ball on her<br />\nown 20 yard line. Winslow was<br />\ntackled so hard on the next play<br />\nthat the ball got away from him<br />\nand Haverford had one more<br />\nchance to score. But Hecht<br />\nblocked and recovered an attempted place-kick, immediately after<br />\nwhich Sheffey broke away for a<br />\n35-yard gain. Hopkins fought desperately to<br />\nwin the old football game in the<br />\nfinal stanza, but to no avail. A<br />\n20-yard pass from Winslow to<br />\nWoodward put the ball on Haverford's 20-yard line, but DeWees intercepted the pass on the next<br />\nplay and pulled his team out of a<br />\nbad hole. Woodward caught a 40yard pass soon after, but heavy<br />\npenalties kept his team at a safe<br />\ndistance from the goal line.

We<br />\nare fighting their government, not<br />\nthem. They will have no further<br />\npart in the war ; hence, if they are<br />\nhelped it will not advance the<br />\n(;erman cause, but rather our own.<br />\nby proving to them our good<br />\nwishes. By this means only we<br />\nmay enable the V. M. C. A. to<br />\nreach our soldiers imprisoned in<br />\n(;ermany.<br />\nThese allied prisoners, being<br />\nidle, need more of our attention<br />\nthan the soldiers in the trenches.<br />\nLet us give those conducting the<br />\ncampaign credit for a little common sense. If our money meant<br />\nfor the allied prisoners were unlikely to reach its'destination, it is<br />\nvery improbable that such an organization as the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nwould risk it when it is so much<br />\nneeded elsewhere. We may be<br />\nsure the money will be well used.<br />\nThe need is great; we must stop<br />\ntalking and give.<br />\nHUMANITY.<br />\nNovember 14, 1917.<br />\nPatriotism and the Senior Class.<br />\n<br />\nGentlemen, we arc in, this war<br />\nand we intend to win, it, and let<br />\nthe Kaiser make no mistake about<br />\nthat. I care not what temporary<br />\nsuccess he gets, America means-to<br />\nwin this war and she means to<br />\nfight it to a finish,. Secretary McAdoo of the Treasury was speaking last night to a convention of<br />\nbankers at the Belvedere Hotel;<br />\nbe might have said the same thing<br />\nto an assembly of Hopkins men.<br />\nWe cannot be reminded too often<br />\nnor tpo emphatically that \"we are<br />\nin this war,\" that we mean to win,<br />\nnd\u2014specifically\u2014that we Hopkins men must help.<br />\n-To do our bit\" is no longer<br />\nenough. If the experience of the<br />\nlast three years means anything,<br />\nGermany will not be licked by<br />\n\"bits.\" It behooses each one of us<br />\nnow to do our all\u2014to act, each of<br />\nus, as though the fate of the whole<br />\n<br />\ncountry depended upon each of us<br />\nalone. Anything short of the fullest measure of what we can do is<br />\nthe measure of our responsibility<br />\nin this war. What each one of us<br />\ndoes now in his own personal<br />\nthought and action, without delay, has many. times the potential<br />\nvalue of what might be done a<br />\nyear from now. Germany is the<br />\nmaster mbchanic of European<br />\nstarvation. Every ounce of food<br />\nthat each one of us can personally<br />\ndeflect from ourselves to the men<br />\nand women and children fighting<br />\nand working for us, and every dollar we can spare to the Government in loans and taxes, will be<br />\nnone too much. We must not shift<br />\nto others the burden of knowing.<br />\nWe must learn, ourselves. Each<br />\none of us must study foods and agricultures\u2014yes, and the building<br />\nof ships. It is what all the people<br />\nknow about any one thing that is<br />\nthe measure of the power of the<br />\nGovernment to accomplish that<br />\none thing. The power of combined<br />\nthought in a nation is supreme.<br />\nAs college men, we have additional and particular responsibilities. Men in the commercial world<br />\nhave personal interests, professional men have out-of-date ideas ; college students are purely disinterested investigators of the living<br />\ntruth\u2014it is to them that the nation looks in the present crisis, for<br />\nleadership in public opinion. It<br />\nis particularly upon us, who have<br />\nall the instruments of current<br />\nknowledge at our immediate command, that our country will depend for the formation of a public opinion and the determination<br />\nof a personal responsibility that<br />\nwill bring the war to its speediest<br />\nend.<br />\nThe Senior Class was brought<br />\na week ago face to face with a<br />\nwar probINn which unfortunately<br />\nit stubborn ly refused to recognize;<br />\nit weakly and blindly permitted<br />\nclass tradition and personal interest to completely overshadow national expediency. The men of<br />\nthe Class of 1918 wilfully shut<br />\ntheir eyes to all the momentous<br />\naffairs beyond the limits of Homewood\u2014the mobilization of millions<br />\nof men and billions of money; the<br />\ncrying need for funds for the stoppage of waste, and- for the elimination of the unnecessary; the<br />\ncountry's call for active, practical,<br />\nwhole-hearted patriotism\u2014when it<br />\noverruled the original Hullabaloo<br />\nBoard and voted to publish a Hullabaloo.<br />\nWilt it heti) to win the war?<br />\nis the test that Daniel Willard,<br />\nof the -National Council of Defense<br />\nand trustee of this University,<br />\nwould put to every expenditure.<br />\nJIll vnte or public, in this hour of<br />\n<br />\nnational need. The Association of<br />\nAmerican Investment Bankers,<br />\nwhose convention in our own city<br />\nadjourned only yesterday, echoed<br />\nthat sentiment when it \"pledged<br />\n'itself to the furtherance of only<br />\nthose enterprises that have a direct bearing on the conduct of<br />\nthe war.\" The Government recently knocked the bottom out of<br />\nthat \"business as usual\" theory<br />\nwhen it promised to shut down all<br />\nindustries not necessary for the<br />\nsuccessful prosecution of the war.<br />\nAt the same time the Y. 1V1. C. A.<br />\nis waging a vigorous campaign<br />\nfor millions for an undeniable and<br />\nworld-benefitting cause, failure to<br />\nraise this fund would be nothing<br />\nless than a national calamity. I<br />\nhardly need mention the Red<br />\nCross and the Liberty Loan. Gentlemen of the Senior Class, a Hullabaloo\u2014however serviceable and<br />\nexcusable in peace times\u2014is, in<br />\nthese times of national stress, woefully out of place and directly contrary to the spirit of the times.<br />\nWhile our country faces a tremendous need for food, ships, munitions, guns, airplanes, supplies;<br />\nwhile millions of men .women and<br />\nchildren are bleeding, starving<br />\nand dying on the battlefields and<br />\nin the ruins of Europe; while millions of prisoners of war are be<br />\ning driven insane, for the lack of<br />\nthe barest human necessities, will<br />\nthe Senior Class insist upon investing hundreds of dollars in anelaborate souvenir of their college life? What is the Ilullabaloo,<br />\nat best, but a mere whim ? It is<br />\na showy book published by the<br />\ngraduating class, which holds between its gold-stamped leather<br />\ncovers unnatural likenesses of<br />\nmost of the members of the class,<br />\nsupplemented by a tabulation of<br />\ntheir sine-cures and affiliations,<br />\nand further elaborated by the<br />\nforced humor and irrelevant remarks of the learned editors.<br />\nThere are also sketchy accounts\u2014<br />\nheavily veneered with the imagination and poorly focused admiration of the editors\u2014of the various teams and activities, and finally the \"ads\" which the business<br />\nmanager will consistently eulogize<br />\nand recommend to your loyal and<br />\nundying patronage.

In this way, the<br />\nefficiency of the battalion will be<br />\nraised by the fact that whenever<br />\na man is promoted he will be familiar with the duties of his new<br />\nstation.<br />\nIn his first lecture for this term,<br />\ndelivered last Thursday, Major<br />\nGuild made it clear that orders<br />\ndelivered by him \"mean business.\"<br />\nHe stated that the utter irresponsibility shown by a small group<br />\nof men in neglecting to attend<br />\ndrills and in disregarding orders<br />\nhas caused him,with the backing of<br />\nthe University authorities, to es<br />\ntablish a system of demerits. Fifty demerits the first semester or<br />\nsixty the second will cause a man<br />\nto be dropped from the course in<br /><br />\nThe first battalion dance, given<br />\nlast Friday evening in the lecture<br />\nhall of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding, was a brilliant success.<br />\nThe dance was all that Hopkins<br />\nheart could desire; in the words<br />\nof a former opponent of the battalion dance plan, it had the \"old<br />\ncotillions beat a mile.\"<br />\nEvery man was in uniform.<br />\nMr. Kistler, the man who has made<br />\nthese dances possible, remarked to<br />\nthe writer, \"I want to make that<br />\nuniform the swellest full-dress outfit that can appear at Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe dance was distinctly a battalion dance; civilians were absolutely tabooed. Even the chaperones\u2014Mrs. Guild, Mrs. Abercrombie and Mrs. Kistler\u2014have more<br />\nthan a passing interest in the<br />\ncorps.<br />\nThe battalion dances and the<br />\ninter-company athletics are part<br />\nof a carefully worked out plan,<br />\noriginating with Theodore Kistler,<br />\nJohns Hopkins physical instructor, and backed by Major Guild<br />\nand Dr. Abercrombie, which was<br />\nfirst announced several weeks ago.<br />\nWhile the scheme is expected to<br />\nconfer many lesser benefits on the<br />\nstudent body, its ultimate goal is<br />\nthe increased efficiency of the battalion. The dances are expected<br />\nto bring out a spirit of battalion<br />\npride and good fellowship among<br />\nthe men; while the inter-company<br />\nathletics are intended to produce<br />\ncompany rivalry, and incidentally<br />\nto benefit the men physically. In<br />\nMr. Kistler's own words, \"Work<br />\nhard and play hard\u2014that's efficiency.\"<br />\nIf the enthusiastic co-operation<br />\nshown thus far by the students is<br />\nany indication, the plan is already<br />\na brilliant success, according to<br />\nMr. Kistler. The three inter-company football games already<br />\nstaged on Straus Field have been<br />\nfar from the jokes that many<br />\nfeared they would be. Right from<br />\nthe start the brand of football exhibited, while possibly not scientific, has at least been very spirited, and, in the opinion of its backers, it promises big things for the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nAccording to the expressed<br />\nopinion of a large number of the<br />\nundergraduates, the introduction<br />\nof general athletics and a common<br />\nsocial interest is one of the greatest events in the history of the<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nHopkins and Haverford last<br />\nSaturday battled through a<br />\nwretched game of football, characterized by fumbles and rough<br />\nand erratic playing on both sides,<br />\nto a scoreless tie. The showing of<br />\nthe 'Varsity on Saturday, after its<br />\nbrilliant victory over Western<br />\nMaryland and \u2022 the snappy practices of last week, was a bitter disappointment to Hopkins followers.<br />\nThe Homewood machine, which<br />\nhas improved steadily since the<br />\nDickinson game of unpleasant<br />\nmemory and seemed to be at its<br />\nhighest point of development, underwent a deceidedly downward<br />\nreversal of form. There was not<br />\nthe slightest trace of a scoring<br />\npunch in the Hopkins machine,<br />\nand\u2014unless the .Black and Blue<br />\nstages a phenomenal comeback in<br />\nthe immediate future\u2014the outlook<br />\nfor bringing the State championship to Homewood is extremely<br />\ndark.<br />\nHaverford succeeded in playing<br />\nas poorly as Hopkins, but should<br />\nhave scored a touchdown in the<br />\nthird period, when she had the<br />\nball just one foot from the Hopkins goal line had not Brennick's<br />\ncharges stood off in stonewall<br />\nfashion the vicious plunges of the<br />\nQuaker backs.<br />\nThere were several brilliant<br />\nplays, sufficiently isolated to have<br />\nno effect on the scoring, that stand<br />\nout in the otherwise indifferent<br />\nplay of the local team. Captain<br />\nWoodward caught two long forward passes from Winslow, which<br />\ngained, respectively, 20 and 40<br />\nyards. On the defensive Woodward threw the Haverford<br />\n' backs<br />\nfor frequent losses and hard falls;<br />\nhis work was the redeeming feature of his team's play. Sheffey<br />\ngave a beautiful exhibition of<br />\nbroken field running (when he<br />\ndodged his way through the Main<br />\nLine team for 35 yards, and Winslow got away for a 25-yard run<br />\nafter receiving one of Leonard's<br />\npunts. But the team as a whole<br />\nseemed overconfident or indifferent, did not work together, made<br />\ncostly blunders, made no interference worthy of the name and consistently fell gown in the pinches.<br />\nHopkins made its best attempt<br />\nto score in the first period when<br />\nWinslow's place-kick from the 32yard line missed the middle of the<br />\ncross-bars by inches. Hopkins outplayed its opponents during this<br />\nstage of the game, but the punch<br />\nwas not there when they came<br />\nwithin scoring distance. Winslow<br /><br />\nmilitary training and force him to<br />\ntake the whole period over again<br />\nbefore he may get a University<br />\ndiploma.<br /><br />\n(Continued \u00f4i page 6, col. 3)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nMaking Ready for St. John's.<br />\nBy COACH BRENN1CK<br /><br />\nOn Saturday the annual game<br />\nwith Haverford was played at that<br />\ncollege and for the first time since<br />\nrelations were established our<br />\neleven came out of the contest undefeated. The game itself was a<br />\nslow, deliberate time-consuming<br />\nprocess, for Haverford seemed<br />\nbent on conserving her resources<br />\nfor the Swarthmore game. None<br />\nthe less she had her usual good<br />\nteam and was much stronger than<br />\nour men had anticipated. Hopkins had not altogether recovered<br />\nfrom the strain of the Western<br />\nMaryland game, which, since it<br />\nwas our first State championship<br />\ngame, took more of the men than<br />\nwas generally suspected. It was,<br />\ntherefore, somewhat natural that<br />\nthe team should have let down to<br />\nsome degree, but this letting down<br />\nwas so marked that it almost resulted in defeat.<br />\nThe one saving factor of the contest is the fact that the men themselves realize that they did not<br />\nplay up to the limit of their powers, and this realization makes one<br />\nfeel that now that the slump is<br />\nover better things may be expected. At any rate, better things<br />\nmust be done if we are to defeat<br />\nSt. John's. This team from Annapolis is making steady progress<br />\nand is, of course, pointing its game<br />\nfor us, and if we hope to win we<br />\nmust work for improvement in<br />\nseveral branches of the game.<br />\nThe team as yet, with the exception of the drive in the Western Maryland game, has not developed a \"punch\" sufficient to<br />\nscore on a team like St. John's or<br />\nMaryland State. One must remember that a good offense is the<br />\nbest defense,for the offensive team<br />\npossesses all the rights of initiative and all freedom of action. It<br />\nis absolutely necessary, therefore,<br />\nthat this week see a marked development in the power with<br />\nwhich the team carries the ball.<br />\nIn our interference, likewise, we<br />\nmust see improvement. In practice, against our own men, the<br />\nbacks leave their feet and take out<br />\nthe proper opponent, but it seems<br />\nthat, once in a contest, the backs<br />\nfeet are glued to the ground. On<br />\nthe whole, the line played well at<br />\nHaverford, for it more than held<br />\nits own, so that, granted normal<br />\ngrowth, its power should be effective in our final games.<br />\nThe real acid test comes Saturday when St. John's comes to<br />\nHomewood. One hears much of<br />\nSt. John's spirit, but it is much<br />\nto be doubted if they are one whit<br />\nsuperior to our men in this regard, for we have as game an<br />\neleven as _ ever represented Hop(Continued on page 10, col. 3)<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 19, 1917.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\nBesides, the reputation of an old-established firm is<br />\nback of each sale with a guarantee.<br /><br />\nJohn C.

Twelve<br />\nmonths passed ; a team representing Hopkins was unable to win a<br />\nsingle significant game.

I arrived here (El<br />\nPasso, Texas) on the twenty-ninth<br />\nof August and have been most<br />\nhopelessly busy ever since. The<br />\nSi h Engineers (mounted) is one of<br />\nthe two mounted engineer battalions in the Regular Army, the<br />\nother being the 9th Battalion,<br />\nwhich is stationed next door to<br />\nus. Our actual location is Camp<br />\nStewart, which is about three<br />\nmiles from the big army post, Fort<br />\nBliss. Plain sand, mosquito brush,<br />\nan occasional prairie dog and the<br />\nburrows and several variations of<br />\ncactus constitute our foreground<br />\nscenery. The background is a little better. The mountains rise up<br />\non our west and north sides and<br />\nafford the one solace to the country's general appearance.<br />\nYou can imagine my feelings<br />\nupon reading the telegram assigning me to a regular battalion of<br />\nengineers, but they were somewhat<br />\ndampened when I realized that I<br />\nwas joining a mounted outfit located in Texas, the home of the<br />\ncowpuncher and where everyone<br />\nlearns to ride before attempting<br />\nto walk. And I was detailed to<br />\nact as a mounted officer to such<br />\nan organization! Ye gods! But<br />\nI was quite a worried person for<br />\nsome time, particularly as I always did fancy motorcycles and<br />\npreferred them to the uncertain<br />\ndisposition and personal equation<br />\nthat is present in a horse. But I<br />\ndiscovered that there were a few<br />\nother reserve officers assigned to<br />\nthe 8th and also found that they<br />\nwere in the same predicament; so,<br />\nof course, that helped immensely.<br />\nFor a full three weeks we went<br />\nthrough the horrors of learning<br />\nhow to ride and I can assure you<br />\nthat learning to become a military<br />\nhorseman on a McClellan saddle<br />\nis not a plush cushion siesta by<br />\nany means. But at last we have<br />\npassed that ordeal.<br />\nAbout two weeks ago the major<br />\ncalled all the officers of the battalion together and we rode out to<br />\nthe foothills where the major had<br />\nselected a spot for.the erection of<br /><br />\na simple trestle timber bridge.<br />\nSpan was 60 feet and the material<br />\navailable was given us. From the<br />\nabove data he asked for individual<br />\nplans to be submitted by each officer in three days. I worked a<br />\nproposition up based almost entirely on the good old reliable \"My<br />\n= If\" formula (I had no technical<br />\nbooks). I remembered \"I\" for<br />\nbd3<br />\nrectangle to be \u2014 and the \"f\"<br />\n12<br />\nfor yellow pine (the timber we<br />\nused)- was given us. The bridge<br />\nwas to be constructed for a threeton truck, which amounts to about<br />\n15,000 pounds. I turned mine in<br />\nand at officers' call three days<br />\nlater the major proclaimed mine<br />\nto stand Al. I was certainly<br />\ntickled because it was practical<br />\nwork done without reference and<br />\nyou can bet I thanked heaven for<br />\nthe several hours spent some time<br />\nback on C. E. I. Of course I had<br />\nthe slight advantage over ;he officers as I am the \"kid\" in the battalion and consequently fresh from<br />\ncollege. Another thing I am most<br />\nthankful for is the time I spent<br />\non learning to letter. E was given<br />\nthe job of taking care of the company fund in may company. It<br />\nhappened that the man who kept<br />\nit before me was a captain from<br />\nthe \"Point\" and his work was in<br />\nit most horrible scrawl,so I thought<br />\nI'd best let him know that we have<br />\nsome things that they don't teach<br />\nat the Academy, and I put my<br />\ntabulations down in my best printing. It was time well spent, for<br />\nwhen the books were inspected, as<br />\nthey are each quarter, 1 received<br />\nanother little boost, and you know<br />\nseveral boosts make a shove and<br />\neach shove is just that much<br />\nnearer one silver bar.<br />\nDon't imagine I am anything of<br />\na horseman yet.

Waldo Newcomer was the<br />\neditor-in-chief who wrote its foreword:\"The Class of '89 is about to<br />\nleave the college halls and go forth<br />\ninto the world,\" feeling \"fully prepared to join the graduates coming from other colleges to dazzle<br />\nthe world in its ignorance by the<br />\nlight of their own superior wisdom.\" There, too, you read the<br />\nsame jokes; find the dean and<br />\n\"Tommy\" Ball the same objects of<br />\nveneration; there the same class<br />\ncontests; the same compulsory hygiene lectures; you learn that in<br />\n'88 \"the Hopkins boys faced the<br />\nfield and gave the 'rah-rah-rah.<br />\nHopkins'\"; in 1888\u2014<br />\nFreshmen hastening to and fro,<br />\nWith looks of misery and woe.<br /><br />\nOne of the interesting features<br />\nof the book is the page containing<br />\nthe football scores of the year '88:<br />\nHopkins, 6; Kendall College, 4.<br />\nHopkins, 0; St. John's, 6.<br />\nHopkins, 0; Princeton, 104.<br />\nHopkins, 54; Univ. of Md., 0.<br />\nHopkins, 26; Duponts, 0.<br />\nHopkins, 6; Baltimore Club, 0.<br />\nHopkins, 0; Charter, 12.<br />\nHopkins, 26; Navy, 12.<br />\nHopkins, 10; Univ. of Pa., 24.<br />\nHopkins, 26; Univ. of Va., 0.<br />\nHopkins, 6; St. John's, 12.<br /><br />\nIt is evident here, however, time<br />\nhas worked great changes, both for<br />\nbetter and for worse. Navy was at<br />\nthat time a frequent victim of<br />\nHopkins' prowess; and, as noted<br />\nabove, in '88 Hopkins defeated the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia by the score<br />\nof 26 to 0; but on the other hand<br />\nthe Black and Blue played St.<br />\nJohn's for five years before scoring a first victory in 1889.<br />\nThe extent of public interest is<br />\ndoubtless best indicated by the<br />\nnewspapers of the day. On the<br />\nWednesday succeeding a game\u2014<br />\nwhich, by the way, seemed to be<br />\nHopkins' newspaper day\u2014if the<br />\ngame had been important locally,<br />\nthe Sun or the American would<br />\nperhaps give an account in some<br />\ndetail. The great outof-town<br />\ngames of other colleges sometimes<br />\nreceived mention. The advance<br />\nwrite-ups were short and sweet\u2014<br />\nand naive; for instance, on October 28, 1888, appears this brief notice: \"Next Saturday the Johns<br />\nHopkins football team will go up<br />\nto Princeton for their regular annual licking.\"<br />\nToward the middle of 1888, however, the Sun apparently secured<br />\nan enterprising sporting editor,<br />\nand he started a real sporting column; and that year three games<br />\nreceived his particular attention,<br />\nof which the Baltimore Club game<br />\nwas the best reported. The Baltimore Club, as you will read below,<br />\nwas composed of \"the daintiest<br />\nyoung fellows in town,\" many of<br /><br />\nball had to be returned to the middle<br />\nof the field. Another series of scrimmages occurred when the Baltimore<br />\nClub was hemmed in to prevent interference, and Dashiell made a long run,<br />\nlaying C. Riggs low before going to<br />\nthe grass himself. The battle was<br />\nfought to within two yards of the<br />\nBaltimore goal line, when the first inning was over without a point being<br />\nscored on either side.<br />\nThe second inning again opened with<br />\nthe Baltimores on the strong run for<br />\nthe Hopkins line. The rushline of the<br />\nlatter gave way before the daring onslaught, and Poe, with the ball in his<br />\narms and surrounded by his team, was<br />\npushed by main force twenty yards.<br />\nHe was tackled in time and in about<br />\nthree seconds ten of the daintiest<br />\nyoung fellows in town were piled in<br />\nsuch a confused mass upon the sward<br />\nthat it seemed doubtful if they would<br />\ncome out each with his own limbs.<br />\nHopkins secured the ball and in their<br />\n\"snap-off\" Dashiell and Whitelock made<br />\na pretty play by which the latter got<br />\na good run, followed by a scrimmage<br />\nand a run by Fearn, who was neatly<br />\nstopped by Fullback Julius Dashiell, at<br />\nthe cost of taking a butting square in<br />\nthe pit of the stomach.<br />\nHopkins then went in for blood\u2014<br />\nand they got it.

M. C. A. are well under<br />\nway. Three or four churches have<br />\nbeen visited on the last few Sunday evenings. In each case .there<br />\nhas been a captain and three other<br />\nspeakers, and a quartet has also<br />\nbeen taken along each time to provide the music.<br />\n\"When I first knew that millionaire, he was a boy watering cows<br />\nand horses on a farm.\"<br />\n\"Doing the same thing now, except he is watering stock in *all<br />\nStreet.\"\u2014Ex.<br />\nin until the '90's, nor did the \"revolving wedge.\" The \"turtle back\"<br />\nconsisted of the whole team,locked<br />\nhalf standing, the man with the<br />\nball in the center; when it seemed<br />\nin danger of being broken up, it<br />\nsplit to let the man with the ball<br />\ndart out. The \"revolving wedge\"<br />\nwas a variation of this; the men<br />\nlocked shoulder to shoulder and<br />\nrevolved as soon as struck. The<br />\nmost approved fashion of stopping<br />\nthis was to have a heavy man dive<br />\nunder the advancing play, while.<br />\nsimultaneously, some one else<br />\nhurdled the first row and landed<br />\non top of the man with the ball.<br />\n(Meantime, I presume, the man<br />\nunderneath had to remain there\u2014<br />\nand pray!)<br />\nProtective padding was also an<br />\ninnovation of the '90's. The players would doubtless have considered themselves in armor plate had<br />\nthey worn the various guards of<br />\n1917; however, they wore stocking<br />\ncaps or even visored caps, and<br />\nfrom one of the above pictures it<br />\nis evident that side whiskers were<br />\nallowed!<br />\nH. E. CORNER,<br />\nGraduate Manager of Athletics.<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nmade another try at place-kicking<br />\ngoal in the second period, but the<br />\nkick was short and Haverford<br />\ntook the ball on her own 6-yard<br />\nline. Leonard dropped back for<br />\na punt that traveled -40 yards and<br />\nthen bounced down the field for 40<br />\nmore. That play stirred Hopkins<br />\nmomentarily and they reeled off<br />\ntwo first downs in rapid succession, Jones gaining 16 yards and<br />\nShelley 10. But that exhausted<br />\nthe driving power of the Black<br />\nand Blue, and Woodward was<br />\nforced to punt. A few minutes<br />\nafterward, Winslow ran back<br />\nLoanard's punt to Haverford's 25yard line, but a bad pass on the<br />\nnext play, gave the ball to the<br />\nQuakers.<br />\n\u2022 In the second half,. Haverford<br />\nt veled 40 yards down the field at<br />\nbreakneck speed ; the Hopkins line<br />\nmade a stand and Carey turned<br />\nthe tide to the favor of the Black<br />\nand Blue when he recovered the<br />\nball by catching a blocked punt.<br />\nSheffey plunged through the line<br />\nfor two 4-yard gains, and Jones<br />\nmade it first down. End runs<br />\ngained nothing and Woodward<br />\npunted once more. Schmidt was<br />\nright on the job when Fitts fumbled the kick and recovered the<br />\nball. The Quaker line held and<br />\nWinslow essayed one more placekick. This time the Red and<br />\nBlack forwards broke through,<br />\nblocked the kick and carried the<br />\nball 20 yards down the field.<br />\nThis was the impetus that started Haverford on an auspicious<br />\nmarch to all but a touchdown. A<br />\nforward pass from DeWees to<br />\nBrown netted 20 yards. DeWees<br />\nskirted the end for 13 more and<br />\nLeonard went through the line for<br />\n7, placing the ball on Hopkins' 5yard line. It called forth the supreme strength of the Hopkins defense to prevent a touchdown, and<br />\n1<br />\n2they made good in spite of a 2/<br />\nyard penalty. Haverford backs<br />\nhit the line three times only to be<br />\nthrown back, and after a forward<br />\npass was grounded for a touchback, Hopkins took the ball on her<br />\nown 20 yard line. Winslow was<br />\ntackled so hard on the next play<br />\nthat the ball got away from him<br />\nand Haverford had one more<br />\nchance to score. But Hecht<br />\nblocked and recovered an attempted place-kick, immediately after<br />\nwhich Sheffey broke away for a<br />\n35-yard gain. Hopkins fought desperately to<br />\nwin the old football game in the<br />\nfinal stanza, but to no avail. A<br />\n20-yard pass from Winslow to<br />\nWoodward put the ball on Haverford's 20-yard line, but DeWees intercepted the pass on the next<br />\nplay and pulled his team out of a<br />\nbad hole. Woodward caught a 40yard pass soon after, but heavy<br />\npenalties kept his team at a safe<br />\ndistance from the goal line.

They will have no further<br />\npart in the war ; hence, if they are<br />\nhelped it will not advance the<br />\n(;erman cause, but rather our own.<br />\nby proving to them our good<br />\nwishes. By this means only we<br />\nmay enable the V. M. C. A. to<br />\nreach our soldiers imprisoned in<br />\n(;ermany.<br />\nThese allied prisoners, being<br />\nidle, need more of our attention<br />\nthan the soldiers in the trenches.<br />\nLet us give those conducting the<br />\ncampaign credit for a little common sense. If our money meant<br />\nfor the allied prisoners were unlikely to reach its'destination, it is<br />\nvery improbable that such an organization as the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nwould risk it when it is so much<br />\nneeded elsewhere. We may be<br />\nsure the money will be well used.<br />\nThe need is great; we must stop<br />\ntalking and give.<br />\nHUMANITY.<br />\nNovember 14, 1917.<br />\nPatriotism and the Senior Class.<br /><br />\nGentlemen, we arc in, this war<br />\nand we intend to win, it, and let<br />\nthe Kaiser make no mistake about<br />\nthat. I care not what temporary<br />\nsuccess he gets, America means-to<br />\nwin this war and she means to<br />\nfight it to a finish,. Secretary McAdoo of the Treasury was speaking last night to a convention of<br />\nbankers at the Belvedere Hotel;<br />\nbe might have said the same thing<br />\nto an assembly of Hopkins men.<br />\nWe cannot be reminded too often<br />\nnor tpo emphatically that \"we are<br />\nin this war,\" that we mean to win,<br />\nnd\u2014specifically\u2014that we Hopkins men must help.<br />\n-To do our bit\" is no longer<br />\nenough. If the experience of the<br />\nlast three years means anything,<br />\nGermany will not be licked by<br />\n\"bits.\" It behooses each one of us<br />\nnow to do our all\u2014to act, each of<br />\nus, as though the fate of the whole<br /><br />\ncountry depended upon each of us<br />\nalone. Anything short of the fullest measure of what we can do is<br />\nthe measure of our responsibility<br />\nin this war. What each one of us<br />\ndoes now in his own personal<br />\nthought and action, without delay, has many. times the potential<br />\nvalue of what might be done a<br />\nyear from now. Germany is the<br />\nmaster mbchanic of European<br />\nstarvation. Every ounce of food<br />\nthat each one of us can personally<br />\ndeflect from ourselves to the men<br />\nand women and children fighting<br />\nand working for us, and every dollar we can spare to the Government in loans and taxes, will be<br />\nnone too much. We must not shift<br />\nto others the burden of knowing.<br />\nWe must learn, ourselves. Each<br />\none of us must study foods and agricultures\u2014yes, and the building<br />\nof ships. It is what all the people<br />\nknow about any one thing that is<br />\nthe measure of the power of the<br />\nGovernment to accomplish that<br />\none thing. The power of combined<br />\nthought in a nation is supreme.<br />\nAs college men, we have additional and particular responsibilities. Men in the commercial world<br />\nhave personal interests, professional men have out-of-date ideas ; college students are purely disinterested investigators of the living<br />\ntruth\u2014it is to them that the nation looks in the present crisis, for<br />\nleadership in public opinion. It<br />\nis particularly upon us, who have<br />\nall the instruments of current<br />\nknowledge at our immediate command, that our country will depend for the formation of a public opinion and the determination<br />\nof a personal responsibility that<br />\nwill bring the war to its speediest<br />\nend.<br />\nThe Senior Class was brought<br />\na week ago face to face with a<br />\nwar probINn which unfortunately<br />\nit stubborn ly refused to recognize;<br />\nit weakly and blindly permitted<br />\nclass tradition and personal interest to completely overshadow national expediency. The men of<br />\nthe Class of 1918 wilfully shut<br />\ntheir eyes to all the momentous<br />\naffairs beyond the limits of Homewood\u2014the mobilization of millions<br />\nof men and billions of money; the<br />\ncrying need for funds for the stoppage of waste, and- for the elimination of the unnecessary; the<br />\ncountry's call for active, practical,<br />\nwhole-hearted patriotism\u2014when it<br />\noverruled the original Hullabaloo<br />\nBoard and voted to publish a Hullabaloo.<br />\nWilt it heti) to win the war?<br />\nis the test that Daniel Willard,<br />\nof the -National Council of Defense<br />\nand trustee of this University,<br />\nwould put to every expenditure.<br />\nJIll vnte or public, in this hour of<br /><br />\nnational need. The Association of<br />\nAmerican Investment Bankers,<br />\nwhose convention in our own city<br />\nadjourned only yesterday, echoed<br />\nthat sentiment when it \"pledged<br />\n'itself to the furtherance of only<br />\nthose enterprises that have a direct bearing on the conduct of<br />\nthe war.\" The Government recently knocked the bottom out of<br />\nthat \"business as usual\" theory<br />\nwhen it promised to shut down all<br />\nindustries not necessary for the<br />\nsuccessful prosecution of the war.<br />\nAt the same time the Y. 1V1. C. A.<br />\nis waging a vigorous campaign<br />\nfor millions for an undeniable and<br />\nworld-benefitting cause, failure to<br />\nraise this fund would be nothing<br />\nless than a national calamity. I<br />\nhardly need mention the Red<br />\nCross and the Liberty Loan. Gentlemen of the Senior Class, a Hullabaloo\u2014however serviceable and<br />\nexcusable in peace times\u2014is, in<br />\nthese times of national stress, woefully out of place and directly contrary to the spirit of the times.<br />\nWhile our country faces a tremendous need for food, ships, munitions, guns, airplanes, supplies;<br />\nwhile millions of men .women and<br />\nchildren are bleeding, starving<br />\nand dying on the battlefields and<br />\nin the ruins of Europe; while millions of prisoners of war are be<br />\ning driven insane, for the lack of<br />\nthe barest human necessities, will<br />\nthe Senior Class insist upon investing hundreds of dollars in anelaborate souvenir of their college life? What is the Ilullabaloo,<br />\nat best, but a mere whim ? It is<br />\na showy book published by the<br />\ngraduating class, which holds between its gold-stamped leather<br />\ncovers unnatural likenesses of<br />\nmost of the members of the class,<br />\nsupplemented by a tabulation of<br />\ntheir sine-cures and affiliations,<br />\nand further elaborated by the<br />\nforced humor and irrelevant remarks of the learned editors.<br />\nThere are also sketchy accounts\u2014<br />\nheavily veneered with the imagination and poorly focused admiration of the editors\u2014of the various teams and activities, and finally the \"ads\" which the business<br />\nmanager will consistently eulogize<br />\nand recommend to your loyal and<br />\nundying patronage. The Hullabaloo, as already inferred, was a<br />\nhighly attractive institution in<br />\nante-bellum days.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo\u2014granting that<br />\nit could be competently published<br />\nby the newly elected board and<br />\nwithin an unprecedented short<br />\nperiod of time\u2014serves no purpose<br />\nnot served more completely and<br />\nefficiently by THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nIf the vanity of the class had to<br />\nfind expressibn, THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nBoard would surely consent to<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nFull Dress and Tuxedo<br />\nProper Dress for dance time.<br />\nFull Dress and Tuxedos, Opera<br />\nHats,Evening Gloves,Ties,etc.<br /><br />\nTHE QUALITY SHOP<br />\n\"Collar-Hug\" Clothes<br />\nBALTIMORE AND LIBERTY<br />\nMilitary Headquarters<br /><br />\nHENDERSON'S<br />\nBaltimore's Most Popular Price Stationers<br /><br />\n229 N.
