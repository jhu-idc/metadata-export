According to Major Robert Larkin<br />\nof campus security, the corpse<br />\nof a 48-year-old black male was<br />\ndiscovered shortly before 11:00<br />\np.m. by the driver of a passing<br />\nautomobile. The victim was<br />\nidentified as Norman Barnes of<br />\n1708 Eutaw Place.<br />\nThe victim was found lying<br />\nface down in the roadway. At<br />\nfirst police thought :he<br />\nhad succumbed to a heart<br />\nattack, since no blood was<br />\nfound except for a small amount<br />\nin the nose and his clothing was<br />\n<br />\nundisturbed. However, upon<br />\ncloser examination doctors at<br />\nUnion Memorial Hospital discovered a small bullet wound in<br />\nthe left side of the victim's<br />\nhead. The wound had been<br />\nobscured by the victim's hair.<br />\nPolice believe that Barnes<br />\nwas killed elsewhere and that his<br />\nbody was, to quote Major<br />\nLarkin, \"probably dumped\" on<br />\nSan Martin Drive from an<br />\nautomobile. Police are uncertain<br />\nhow long the victim had been<br />\ndead, but, according to Larkin,<br />\n\"it couldn't have been very<br />\nlong.\" No solid clues as to the<br />\nidentity of the killers have yet<br />\nbeen found, but an investigation<br />\nis continuing.<br />\n<br />\nTwo Assaulted<br />\nNear Garland<br />\nBY LINDSAY KAPLAN<br />\n<br />\nMajor Larkin<br />\n<br />\nTwo incidents of physical<br />\nassault were reported to Campus<br />\nSecurity recently.

The<br />\nStudent Constitution, which is<br />\npredominant, requires a unanimous vote of the Student<br />\nCouncil to close meetings of<br />\nstanding committees, which include the Student Activities<br />\nCommission and presumably its<br />\nown subcommittee, the Executive Board.<br />\nAsked why discussion about expenditures of student<br />\nfunds are closed to the student<br />\nbody, SAC Chairman Karl Block<br />\nanswered, \"Because they're not<br />\nopen.\" Student Council President George Connolly, who<br />\nintroduced the motion to close<br />\nthe meeting, argued that the<br />\nBoard must meet in secret<br />\nsession in order to discuss<br />\n\"personalities\", that is, SAC<br />\nclub officers who submit requests for allocations.<br />\nBlock had stated earlier<br />\n<br />\nthat not only were meetings to<br />\nbe held in closed session, but<br />\ndecisions of the Board and the<br />\nSAC budget itself were to be<br />\nsecret except for the annual<br />\nratification by the SAC and<br />\nStudent Council.

He referred<br />\nto the furor last year when the<br />\nMed School accepted only nine<br />\nHopkins undergraduates, most<br />\nof them in the accelerated<br />\nprogram, and promised, \"You'll<br />\nget a good shake. We tend to go<br />\nwith those we know best.\"<br />\nAnderson told the attentive pre-meds how they would<br />\nbe evaluated by medical school<br />\nadmissions committees, even as<br />\nhe despaired at flaws in the<br />\nsystem. \"Play the game.\" was<br />\nhis advice when asked how to<br />\nanswer application questions.<br />\n\"I've told you categorically that I don't believe in the<br />\nMCAT.\" he said, pointing out<br />\nthat the new format has been in<br />\nuse only three years. Explaining<br />\nthat the MCAT covers a broad<br />\nspectrum of subject material, he<br />\nadded, \"People at Homewood<br />\nwho start at the cell and work<br />\ndown are at a disadvantage.\"<br />\nAlthough unwilling to endorse preparation courses such<br />\nas Stanley Kaplan's, Anderson<br />\nhinted that applicants should<br />\nprepare in some way for the<br />\nMCAT's. The Kaplan service is<br />\nexpensive, but offers sample test<br />\nquestions taken from past<br />\nMCAT's. Anderson said that<br />\nmost medical schools require a<br />\nminimum average score of nine.<br />\nAnderson outlined the<br />\ncontroversy over New York<br />\nState's `truth in testing' law,<br />\nwhich requires that corrected<br />\ncopies of standardized tests be<br />\n\u2022returned to the students. The<br />\ncorporation which administers<br />\nthe MCAT claims that disclosure<br />\nwould exhaust its stock of<br />\nquestions and announced that<br />\ntest centers will no longer be<br />\noffered in New.York. Similar<br />\nlegislation is under consideration<br />\nin Maryland and in Congress.<br />\nThe Director of Admissions cited statistics to demonstrate that one's chances of<br />\nadmission to medical school vary<br />\non the basis of state residency.<br />\nEven 'private' colleges receive<br />\nstate funds and therefore favor<br />\nresidents. Some applicants are<br />\nvirtually assured of admission to<br />\na state medical college. Other<br />\nstates, including those in the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Region, produce<br />\nmore applicants to medical school<br />\nthan they have seats to offer.<br />\nOn the bright side, applications<br />\nto medical schools peaked early<br />\nin the decade and have declined<br />\nabout 10% each year since.<br />\nApplicants were advised<br />\nnot to submit `cute' or sarcastic<br />\nessays on the application form.<br />\nResponses should be credible;<br />\nfor example, interest professed<br />\nin a particular school will have<br />\nmore impact if one cites a<br />\nparticular program or professor.<br />\nAnderson said that applicants<br />\ncan expect to be questioned at<br />\nthe interview on the subject<br />\nof their essays.<br />\nAt Hopkins, a pencil and<br />\npaper are provided at the interview so that the applicant can<br />\ndetail his research work or the<br />\nlike by sketching molecular<br />\n<br />\nstructures, etc. Other medical<br />\nschools use 'stress' techniques at<br />\nthe interview, such as rapid<br />\nquestioning by several admissions officers.<br />\nAnderson stated that there<br />\nis a linear correlation between<br />\nGPA and acceptance to medical<br />\nschool, 3.1 being the minimum,<br />\nbut expressed doubt that the<br />\nGPA is a good predictor of<br />\nsuccess. One's grade in organic<br />\nchemistry may be a better<br />\nindication of first year performance in medical school, according to Anderson.<br />\nAnderson urged applicants<br />\nto withdraw any pending applications once they are admitted<br />\nto the school of their choice, in<br />\norder that those slots can be<br />\nfilled.

I will deal with Mr.<br />\nMoritz' glaring contradiction<br />\n<br />\nfirst and get that out of the way.<br />\nMr. Moritz insists that the<br />\nChaplain's Office should be<br />\nnon-political. I challenge him to<br />\nname one religious institution<br />\nthat does not, somewhere along<br />\nthe line, come into contact and<br />\ndeal with political issues. The<br />\nfact is, that the primary function<br />\nof religion is to assist in the<br />\nfulfillment of people's spiritual<br />\nneeds. People's spiritual needs<br />\nhave much to do with their daily<br />\nlives, and that includes most<br />\npolitical issues, because they do<br />\naffect people. The first step to<br />\ndeal with these needs is to be<br />\ninformed about them.<br />\nThe<br />\nChaplain's Office provides information that would otherwise<br />\nbe hard to get.<br />\nYou want the \"other side\"?<br />\nThat's easy to find on this<br />\ncampus. Just go to class and<br />\nlisten to most of the professors.<br />\nTalk to any member of the<br />\nadministration. Buy a newspaper<br />\nor a magazine, turn on the radio<br />\nor TV. It's the Chaplain's Office<br />\nthat gives this campus a semblance of balance on political<br />\nissues.<br />\nMr. Moritz, in your next<br />\nfour years here, if you are<br />\nobservant, you will notice this<br />\npattern in the work of the<br />\nChaplain's Office: It's priorities<br />\nare to meet people's needs, on<br />\nand off campus, that are not<br />\nbeing attended to by anyone<br />\nelse. These may be material--for<br />\ninstance, the Chaplain's Office<br />\ncan always be counted on to<br />\nwork with relief efforts for disaster victims through food<br />\nand clothing drives; or non<br />\nmaterial--such as the Tutorial<br />\nProject or the informative seminars available to interested Hopkins students.<br />\nAnd one last thing you<br />\nmight notice: anything sponsored by the Chaplain's Office has<br />\nthe whole-hearted support of Dr.<br />\nWickwire and the entire staff.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nJ.

He<br />\nwrote concerning the essentially<br />\nbiased political leanings of the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain.<br />\nFirst of all, I would like to<br />\npoint out that aside from<br />\npicking up a copy of the Lowdown, attending two Sunday<br />\nExperiences, and one Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix, I have had no<br />\naffiliation with the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice whatsoever. My comments are purely those of an<br />\ninterested student.<br />\nIt appears to me that what<br />\nis most crucial about Mr.<br />\nMoritz's arguments is his main<br />\nassumption that the realms of<br />\npolitics and religion are, and<br />\nought to be, separate entities.<br />\nOn the merely practical level, this<br />\nhardly seems possible. Political,<br />\nreligious, economic, indeed, any<br />\nsocial system is ultimately based<br />\non, interacts within, and creates<br />\nmodifications in a shared value<br />\nstructure. To separate religion<br />\nfrom politics in terms of no<br />\nnationally sanctioned orthodoxy, is far from prohibiting the<br />\nreligious communities from actively following the dictates of<br />\ntheir consciences in all matters<br />\npolitical or not. In fact, I would<br />\nhope that this separation would<br />\ntend to facilitate such grass roots<br />\nparticipation in politics.<br />\nReligion was never intended<br />\nas a barrier behind which we can<br />\nretreat from the evils of our<br />\nworld, but rather as a structure<br />\nthrough which we can identify<br />\nand actively strive to end those<br />\nevils. When John quoted Christ<br />\nas saying, \"...You will know the<br />\ntruth, and the truth will make<br />\nyou free,\" he was recording<br />\nwhat is perhaps one of the<br />\nmost unequivocal statements in<br />\nthe New Testament. Freedom is<br />\nnot ours to accept or reject, and<br />\nneither are the responsibilities<br />\nwhich accompany it.<br />\nI am<br />\npersonally very grateful that in<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office there are<br />\nthose who \"know the truth\",<br />\nand fully accept the responsibilities of freedom.<br />\nFinally, to think that such<br />\npolitical activities are allowed to<br />\npersist in an institution so<br />\nrepresentative of the monied<br />\ninterests of this country, is one<br />\nof the few indications I have had<br />\nwhile at Hopkins that our<br />\nmorally stagnant culture has<br />\nsome hope for the future.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nGerald Macdonald<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt's October and the leaves are turning brown. It is a season of<br />\nchange \u2014 the clear, cold death of winter shines ahead of us.<br />\nSoon we will be able to see our breath, frisk with small dogs in<br />\nthe snow, and roll our cars over on patches of black ice. With<br />\nwinter approaching and good jokes sure to be as scarce as<br />\nsummer birds, now is the time to lay in a winter's supply of<br />\njokes in the new October comedy issue of National Lampoon;<br />\nand as for summer birds, you can probably mail away for them<br />\nto Florida.

So go buy one now at, your local newsstand or<br />\nbookstore before David Frost starts nipping people's noses,<br />\nmaking it a pain to go outside.<br />\n<br />\nKarl Moritz raised a question meaningful for everyone<br />\nfrom atheists to Jesus freaks in<br />\nhis 9/29/79 letter to the editor:<br />\nHow involved should religious<br />\ninstitutions be with the rest of<br />\nsociety?<br />\nStating that \"it is<br />\ncertainly wrong to have certain<br />\npolitical viewpoints sponsored<br />\nby the Office of the Chaplain...\", the letter claims that the<br />\nChaplain's office should be<br />\nnon-political and non-partisan.<br />\n<br />\nHis argument that religion<br />\nbelongs'in chu-rches and temples<br />\nand should not enter into<br />\npolitics (into the structuring of<br />\nsociety) is as repugnant as the<br />\nargument that women belong in<br />\nthe house and should not enter<br />\nthe work force.<br />\nReligions are in large part<br />\nethical codes concerning how<br />\npeople should relate. The major<br />\nworld religions hold a vision of a<br />\nsociety where people behave<br />\nmore kindly to one another than<br />\nwe do now. So why is a religious institution wrong for trying to do a little bit to help<br />\nmake society more humane. A<br />\nlot of people, including me<br />\nadmittedly, believe that society<br />\nshould be more humane but<br />\ndon't do a hell of a lot to change<br />\nit<br />\nThe Chaplain's office works<br />\nto bring non-denominational<br />\nreligious beliefs to bear on<br />\nsociety. This is the extent of the<br />\nOffice's involvement in politics<br />\nand I see nothing, wrong with it.<br />\nIt's ret'reshing to see people who<br />\ndo more with religion than pay<br />\nan offering and lip service one<br />\nday a week and go on living<br />\nhypocritically the rest of the<br />\ntime.<br />\nIt's good to see people<br />\ndiscard alienation and work to<br />\nimprove society. It's political<br />\nfor the Chaplain's Office to run<br />\nits program tutoring underpriviledged kids. Does the fact that<br />\nit's political make it wrong?<br />\nMr. Moritz objects if the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain is using<br />\nhis money to get involved in<br />\npolitics (i.e. suggesting boycotting J. P. Stevens products<br />\nbecause Stevens is one of the<br />\nmost flagrant violators of the<br />\nway non-denominational religious beliefs say people should<br />\ntreat one another). What is<br />\nwrong with taking a stand on<br />\nissues that involve your beliefs?<br />\nMr. Moritz clearly differs<br />\nwith some of the stands the nondenominational Office of the<br />\nChaplain takes. If the Office<br />\nwere to avoid taking stand on<br />\npolitical issues, it would be<br />\nshirking its duties as a spokesgroup for the common elements<br />\nof religion. God has not endorsed the political status quo<br />\n(though rumor has it s/he is<br />\nconsidering endorsing Ted Kennedy).<br />\nSeriously, not all of us at<br />\nHopkins are going to agree with<br />\nevery stand the 0. C. takes, just<br />\nas I'm sure not all of us agree<br />\nwith the way Hopkins spends<br />\nand invests its (our) bucks (so<br />\nthat you and I support racism in<br />\nSouth Africa, for instance).<br />\nIf the Chaplain's Office<br />\nwere to avoid taking a stand<br />\nbecause not all of us agree with<br />\nit, the 0.C. would become what<br />\nmany American religious institutions are today: spineless in<br />\nliving up to their ethical/religious codes, and ineffective in<br />\nsetting an example and in<br />\ncreating a structure through<br />\nwhich those who purport to<br />\nbelieve in their codes demonstrate their beliefs by their<br />\nactions.<br />\nBruce Smith '80<br />\n<br />\nMary<br />\nFrat<br />\nClarke<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn response to that great<br />\nfeminist tract of September 29,<br />\n\"Frat Strategy,\" this housewife-politico would appreciate<br />\nthe chance to correct the few,<br />\nfaltering attempts at fact which<br />\ninsinuated themselves into the<br />\notherwise distracting rhetoric \u2022<br />\n(cf, Mixed Metaphors, Hyperbole, et. al.). Wishful thinking<br />\naside, the pernicious Anti-Frat<br />\nBill does not require rewriting. It<br />\nis, as we say,\"legally sufficient.\"<br />\nProposed amendments would, of<br />\ncourse, be considered by the<br />\nCommittee (cf Lawyer Referral<br />\nService). Furthermore, a bill<br />\nwhich has not yet been scheduled for hearing is unlikely to be<br />\nvoted on as soon as City Council<br />\nreconvenes on October 8 (cf<br />\nAmerican History 101). Finally,<br />\nin most circles, \"house-wife\"<br />\n(sic) is not considered a perjorative label, especially by those<br />\nwhose tuition is paid by same (cf<br />\n\"...the hand that feeds you\").<br />\nMy compliments on so effectively restraining any impulse to<br />\nlobby against this legislation.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nMary Pat Clarke<br />\n<br />\nYearbook<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nPlease let us know if there is<br />\nany problem in filling the 1980<br />\nyearbook with photos.

It's the<br />\nkind of novel that would look nice under<br />\na Christmas tree or, even better, adorning<br />\none. But, like an ornament, the shimmer<br />\nquickly fades and leaves you taking it<br />\napart trying to figure out just what you<br />\nfound so intriguing in the first place.<br />\nAnd, in the end, you wind up with shreds<br />\nof tinsel and cardboard and nothing left<br />\nto do but throw the mess away. John<br />\nIrving's The World According to Carp is<br />\njust that -- a book asking to be thrown<br />\naway.<br />\nBut the novel purported to be<br />\n\"America's most jubilant best seller!\"is<br />\nvery 'sly. John Irving is a master prose<br />\nstylist who knows how to trap the reader<br />\nin his tale. He's also got his finger on the<br />\nAmerican public's pulse \u2014 its hunger for<br />\nnews about its eccentric self. The book<br />\nbegins,\"Garp's mother, Jenny Fields, was<br />\narrested in Boston in 1942 for wounding<br />\n<br />\na man in a movie theater,\" and leads us<br />\non through a picaresque tale of an<br />\nindependent nurse who seizes her opportunity to have a fatherless child<br />\nby sitting on a vegetable-minded sergeant's last erection. The preposterous<br />\nplot touches every eccentric extreme as<br />\nthe nurse and her son involve themselves<br />\nwith tongueless feminists, child molesters,<br />\ntranssexual football players and many<br />\nother typical products of the brutal<br />\ninsanity of the modern world.<br />\nBy dangling those lurid tidbits<br />\nbefore our eyes, Irving nearly manages to<br />\nmake us care about his characters and<br />\nmanipulate us into accepting his inanely<br />\ninnocuous conclusion that though \"we<br />\nare all terminal cases,\" \"we must have<br />\nenergy.\" Toward the middle of the book,<br />\nwe slowly begin to realize Irving's empty<br />\nprofundity and actual purpose \u2014 the<br />\ndestructive mockery of America, of<br />\nwriters, and of himself. Irving's hero,<br />\nCarp (Jenny's son)is a writer, or rather,<br />\na would-be writer. His Kafka-esque tales,<br />\nfaithfully \"re-printed\" in full in the<br />\n<br />\nnovel, are poorly written and boring, and<br />\nhis adolescent attempts at plotting make<br />\nhim sound like a washed-out Holden<br />\nCaulfield.<br />\nBut Irving's self-destructiveness<br />\nis most manifest in his point-of-view. Of<br />\ncourse, nothing in a novel is there without a purpose, but Irving smears this in<br />\nour faces by his omnipresent use of the<br />\nconstruction, \"would become\": not only<br />\ndoes he spoil the suspense, he even rips<br />\naway the illusion of it. Irving does this<br />\nmore and more frequently as he realizes<br />\nthat his story is going nowhere. The<br />\nplot's tragedies become harsher and more<br />\nabsurd and the characters die ridiculous<br />\ndeaths as Irving quickly drops his facade<br />\nof omniscient narrator and assumes that<br />\nwhich he has secretly nursed all along -God. The World According to Garp is the<br />\ngospel of modern life.<br />\nIlls gospel, this distorted truth<br />\nabout a failed writer in a failed world,<br />\ndisintegrates precisely the way the story<br />\ndoes \u2014 because of modernity's lack of<br />\nnerve. Irving's attempt at mythologizing<br />\n<br />\nazel<br />\n\u2022 American lite clearly reveals the temporariness of our society, a \"world\" of<br />\npettiness, unimportant values and writers<br />\nthrowing together slick but shallow<br />\nbest-sellers. If The World According to<br />\nGarp had tried to offer new solutions or<br />\ninsights, John Irving's considerable talent<br />\nmight have served some purpose. By<br />\nflashing the tinsel, by fooling us with<br />\nclever sleight-of-hand, Irving has knowingly written a book that will flicker and<br />\nfade -- leaving us staring at the Garp-filled<br />\nwastebasket with the sugarstupid satisfaction of having consumed over 600 pages<br />\nof mental junk food.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nDylan's Train Arrives<br />\nBY DAVE ARMSTRONG<br />\nBob Dylan has been making<br />\nrecords for 17 years now. Slow Train<br />\nCorning is, in my opinion, the best record<br />\nhe's ever made.<br />\nSources close to Dylan have been<br />\nsaying that for the past few months he has<br />\nbeen attending a Bible-study group led<br />\nby a fundamentalist preacher. Along<br />\nwith these confirmed repprts came some<br />\nrumors - that Dylan had veen \"born<br />\nagain\", that Dylan had been baptized in<br />\n(of all places) Pat Boone's pool; that<br />\nDylan was going to retire, ad nauseum.<br />\nIt is apparent from listening to<br />\nSlow Train Corning that Dylan has, in<br />\nfact been doing some Bible-reading; the<br />\ntitles alone suggest that, with songs like<br />\n\"Gotta Serve Somebody\", \"Gonna<br />\nChange My Way of Thinking\", and<br />\n\"When He Returns.\" However, the<br />\nsubject matter of the lyrics doesn't<br />\nmatter. Dylan has delivered, in one<br />\nbreathtaking swoop, the most cohesive<br />\nartistic statement he's ever made.<br />\nThe songs are incisive, biting<br />\ncommentaries on American society. Dylan now has the opportunity and the<br />\ninsight to be as unflinchingly honest as he<br />\never was with \"Blowin' In The Wind\" and<br />\n\"The Times They Are A-Changing\", and<br />\nhe's responded by surpassing his old<br />\nheights. \"Slow Train\" is probably the<br />\nbest example of this awesome eloquence and also contains the most chilling set of<br />\nlines on the album: \"Take a look around<br />\nyou/ You're sure to be embarassed\".<br />\nThere is not a bad cut on the<br />\nentire album. Side One opens with<br />\n\"Gotta Serve Somebody\", a slow, bluesy,<br />\nhaunting piece. It comes across as a<br />\nwarning, like a revivalist sermon of fire<br />\n<br />\nand brimstone. Driven by Barry Beck- Budokan, the album immediately precedett's ekectric piano, Dylan growls out the ing this one. (As a matter of fact, the<br />\nlyrics with the most confidence and same stylistic shifts which mark Slow<br />\nself-assurance he's ever displayed. \"Pre- Train Coming are discernable in embryoncious Angel\", which follows, is a beauti- ic form on that album).<br />\nThe album's closer, \"When He<br />\nful folk -rich melody around which<br />\nDylan has woven his \"new style\" lyrics, Returns\",- is a surprising, spiritually-influsuch as \"You know I just can't make enced piece with Barry Beckett' providing<br />\nit by myself / I'm a little too blind to Dylan's sole accompaniment on acoustic<br />\npiano. Dylan half-shouts it, singing with<br />\nsee\".<br />\n\"Gonna Change My Way of the;ame maniacal fervor that characterizes<br />\nThinking\" is a surprising stylistic twist. black spirituals. This is the piece where<br />\nElectric guitar and horns; combine to Dylan most heavily shows the Biblical<br />\ncreate an interplay reminiscent of the influence.<br />\nRolling Stones. \"When You Gonna Wake<br />\nAt least half of what makes Slow<br />\nUp\" is another masterpiece, with the Train Coming so special is not the comsame sort of syncopated rythmic pattern positions but the truly extraordinary<br />\nthat was previously most apparent on group of musicians Dylan has put toge\"Love Minus Zero\" from Bob Dylan at ther for this album. Mark Knopfler and<br />\nPick Withers of Dire Straits provide the<br />\nguitar and drum work, while the aforementioned Barry Beckett does his usual<br />\nsuperb job on keyboards.

It was all<br />\nthere: the sounds of banging mixed<br />\nwith whispers of \"hey man, wanna buy<br />\nsome Panama Red?\"; the crowd yelling<br />\nand lighting matches and farting; the<br />\nsmells of dope, Mennen antiperspirant,<br />\npuke, beer, ten-year-old sweatshirts, and<br />\nsinged hair (from the matches); and<br />\nabove all, the 115 decibel wall of soundwaves from the two renowned heavy<br />\nmetal bands.<br />\nThe reputations of Rainbow and<br />\nBlue Oyster Cult promised a night of<br />\nreal headbanger music (as News-Letter<br />\nrockcritic Steve Randall calls it), and<br />\nthis promise was more or less fulfilled.<br />\nRainbow, in case you Hoppie nerds<br />\ndon't know, is simply the showcase for<br />\nguitarist Ritchie Blackmore and his ego<br />\ntrips. Since Blackmore was the main<br />\ncreative force for the late great Deep<br />\nPurple, Rainbow is usually pretty good<br />\nAnd since<br />\nasskicking heavy metal.<br />\nDeep Purple was known for its dynamic<br />\nstage shows, it follows that Rainbow<br />\nshould be equally exciting. I was in<br />\n<br />\nLondon this summer when the new<br />\nRainbow album came out and heard a<br />\nradio interview with Cozy Powell (drummer for Rainbow); when it was mentioned that Roger Glover (another<br />\nex-Purple) was the new bassist for the<br />\ngroup, I thought, hey, like it's almost as<br />\nif D.P. was back on its feet again, and<br />\nwe fossils from the heavy metal age<br />\ncould plug in our headphones for a good<br />\nfreaking. So, there were great expectations for the Rainbow set.<br />\nBlue Oyster Cult was another<br />\nmatter entirely. Before 1976 (i.e. before<br />\n\"Agents of Fortune\") the Cult played<br />\nsome of the heaviest metal around. But<br />\nlately their stuff has been kind of bland:<br />\nsomeone had put a leash on their trademark \"Charge of the Guitar Brigade\"<br />\nstyle. However, the Cult has always had a<br />\ngood live set, and their laser/light show<br />\nwas reputed to be second to none. So, I<br />\nexpected that either they would play a<br />\nlot of their oldies, and blow the roof off<br />\nthe Civic Center, or play mostly new cuts,<br />\nwhich would bore us to tears.<br />\nAnd now to see who was the<br />\nbetter of the two bands: the envelope, please... and the winner is the Blue<br />\nOyster Cult, by a mile; sorry Ritchie,<br />\nonly Starkist makes tunafish from oranges! Anyway, Rainbow, to me (an<br />\n<br />\nA Slice ofthe 60's<br />\nBY ROSALIND RESNICK<br />\nSixties nostalgia has become the<br />\ntopic of innumerable cocktail parties and<br />\neditorials in the past few years. Successful<br />\nmembers of the \"Cynical Seventies\"<br />\napathetic, material culture now long for<br />\nthe days of Flower Power, marches on<br />\nWashington, civil rights, worker-student<br />\nsolidarity and hash brownies. There's no<br />\ngoing back, of course, but there is a place<br />\nfor the True Believer to go\u2014The Bread and<br />\nRoses Coffeehouse, a little hole-in- the-wall<br />\nin Waverly, off 31st and Greenmount.<br />\nThe Coffeehouse, a 60' by 25'<br />\nrectangular room with a bar on the side,<br />\nis plastered with leftist political literature<br />\nof all kinds-- women's rights, gay rights,<br />\nworker's rights, anti-nuke, co-ops, clinics,<br />\nand freedom for political prisoners. The<br />\nwalls are lined with bookshelves and<br />\nmagazine racks stuffed with \"alternative<br />\nperiodicals.\" Beside the big bulletin board<br />\nis a sunrise mural with a Chesapeake<br />\nEnergy Alliance banner draped over it;<br />\nbeside the bar is a big, circular mirror and<br />\na \"Free Angela Davis\" poster. The<br />\ndonated chairs and tables include every<br />\nconceivable style, and you can sit there<br />\nand munch your home-made goodies<br />\nfrom the Natural Foods Co-op across the<br />\nstreet while listening to the New Wave<br />\nband in the dim light of the wine-bottled<br />\n<br />\ncandles.<br />\nBread and Roses preserves pretty<br />\nmuch the same atmosphere it had in 1975<br />\nwhen it was opened by several members<br />\nof the New American Movement, a<br />\nDemocratic Socialist organization. They<br />\nnamed the place Bread and Roses after a<br />\nlabor movement slogan taken from a<br />\n1912 strike against the textile industries.<br />\nToday, the Coffeehouse is run by a<br />\n\"workers' council\" consisting of Chris<br />\nStadler, a day-care worker and distributor<br />\nof leftist literature; Linda Scheetz,<br />\nanother day-care worker; and Joel Killgore, a baker's apprentice. According to<br />\nStadler, the Coffeehouse's purpose is to<br />\n\"be a real community center\" where<br />\npeople can \"talk, get to know one another, play games, read a book.., and be<br />\ntogether in a free way.\" Stadler also sees<br />\nthe Coffeehouse as an \"information<br />\ncenter and resource facility.., for social<br />\nchange.\"<br />\nThe members of the \"workers'<br />\ncouncil\" insist they work \"with\" the<br />\nCoffeehouse and not \"for\" it. No one is<br />\npaid for working there, and all decisions<br />\nare reached through concensus, not<br />\nvoting. According to Stadler, the Coffeehouse sponsors most events itself but<br />\nsometimes rents the hall to those groups<br />\nwho support \"freedom, justice, and<br />\nequality uppermost in practice\" and are<br />\n<br />\nold metalphile), was quite disappointing. Blackmore was undoubtedly ticked<br />\nabout being the opener, and this probably had some effect on the set. The<br />\nband plowed through its numbers with a<br />\nminimum of frills, doing only tracks<br />\nfrom its new album Down to Earth.<br />\nThe Baltimorons loved 'em, though--the<br />\nsigns \"Blackmore is No. 1\" and \"Rainbow\" were all over the place, and the lead<br />\nvocalist had them stomping and yelling<br />\nand lighting matches. On All Night Love<br />\nthe audience got to do some of its own<br />\nsinging; \"Love's No Friend of Mine\" also<br />\nbrought a frenzied response from the<br />\ngrunge-crazed crowd. However, instrumentals dominated the major portion of<br />\nthe 50-m in ute set. These included<br />\nsegments of \"A Light in the Black\",<br />\n\"Come on All Ye Faithful\"(!),\"The Star<br />\nSpangled Banner\" (who does Blackmore<br />\nthink he is, Hendrix?!) and Tchaikovsky's<br />\n\"1812 Overture\" (!!) on synthesizer with<br />\ncrashing drums at the climax.., this was<br />\nprobably the best part of the whole<br />\nRainbow show, with some wild lights<br />\nwreaking havoc on organist Don Earle.<br />\nThe band then disappeared to a soft<br />\nchorus of \"Over the Rainbow\", and<br />\ntotally ignored the fans' cries for an<br />\nencore.<br />\nRainbow is extremely com-petent,<br />\nand Ritchie Blackmore is, despite his<br />\nfaults, an incredible guitarist. I'm sure<br />\nthat the band's main set would be much<br />\nmore exciting; I mean, what does one<br />\nfrom<br />\nan<br />\nexpect<br />\nopening<br />\nact?<br />\nThe Blue Oyster Cult more than made<br />\nup for the disappointing Rainbow set.<br />\nComing on about half an hour Sfter the<br />\nlast strains of \"Over the Rainbow\"<br />\nhad died away, the Cult immediately<br />\nlaunched into a searing version of\"Dominance and Submission\" (from their<br />\nclassic Secret Treaties album). Right off,<br />\nit had the crowd shouting part of the<br />\nchorus (\"dominance... dominance... \").<br />\nThen came a track from the new album<br />\nMirrors, called \"Dr. Musik\". It, too, was<br />\nwell-received by the crowd. Then, a little<br />\nrap with the crowd: \"Don't want you all<br />\nto get paranoid that we're not going to<br />\nplay your old favourites,\" and hit \"Cities<br />\n\"consistent with movements for people's<br />\nfreedom... and the removal of class<br />\ndistinctions.\" In the past, Bread and<br />\nRoses has presented folk nights (where<br />\nyou bring your musical instruments and<br />\njam), poetry readings, pot luck suppers,<br />\nsolo guitarists, folk singers, bluegrass,<br />\nreggae, and New Wave bands, art films,<br />\nand a slide show on \"Lesbian Sexual<br />\nImagery in the Fine Arts.\"<br />\nDespite the heavy political emphasis, most of the late 20's crowd that<br />\ncomes to the Coffeehouse is not politically active, Stadler says. Last Saturday<br />\nnight people came to the \"Anti-Nuke/Anti-Disco\" mainly to hear the \"New<br />\nWave\" sound of Baltimore's local group,<br />\nThe Reason. According to group member<br />\nJ.D. Considine, The Reason is not especially anti-disco, but its lead singer is<br />\nstrongly committed to the anti-nuclear<br />\ncause and has given six or seven free<br />\nconcerts to raise money for it. The<br />\nReason's music was loud and upbeat, and<br />\nthe lead singer's vibrant charisma sparked<br />\nthe atmosphere for the crowd's loose,<br />\nsixties-style rocking.<br />\nThough Stadler and the rest of the<br />\n\"workers' council\" try to provide music<br />\nthat will \"make people think,\" they don't<br />\nalways succeed. Stadler concedes that<br />\nsometimes the Coffeehouse is little<br />\ndifferent from commercial bars and disco<br />\nparlors. Nervertheless, Bread and Roses<br />\nplans to \"k tep looking for new culture<br />\nand creative culture.., with social cause<br />\nrelation.\"<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 15<br />\non Flame\". And so it went,\"Extraterrestrial Intelligence,\" \"Buck's Boogie\" (an<br />\noldie guitar workout by Donald Roeser.<br />\nalias Buck Dharma), \"The Last Days of<br />\nMay\", \"Godzilla\" (the one the crowd<br />\nwas waiting for, which they performed<br />\nwith their characteristic crunching power chords), \"Hot Rails To Hell\", an<br />\nunnamed boogie featuring all five members of the band on guitars, \"Born<br />\nto be Wild\" and \"ME 262\" as their last<br />\nnumber, which was marked by the<br />\nexplosion of fireworks--an extremely<br />\nimpressive display that illuminated the<br />\nstoned crowd. On they came for an<br />\nencore, ending the night with a fiery<br />\nrendition of their epic \"Don't Fear the<br />\nReaper\". Truly fantastic.<br />\nMy only complaint was that<br />\nthe Cult did not have its famous laser<br />\nshow, but it made up for this with the<br />\nfireworks and the excellent light effects.<br />\nThe reason, I suspect, for all the oldies<br />\nplayed in the set lies behind a rumour<br />\nthat lead vocalist Eric Bloom had a sore<br />\nthroat; the old numbers do not contain<br />\nas much vocal material as the newer<br />\ntracks. If that rumour is true, well<br />\ndone!

According to Major Robert Larkin<br />\nof campus security, the corpse<br />\nof a 48-year-old black male was<br />\ndiscovered shortly before 11:00<br />\np.m. by the driver of a passing<br />\nautomobile. The victim was<br />\nidentified as Norman Barnes of<br />\n1708 Eutaw Place.<br />\nThe victim was found lying<br />\nface down in the roadway. At<br />\nfirst police thought :he<br />\nhad succumbed to a heart<br />\nattack, since no blood was<br />\nfound except for a small amount<br />\nin the nose and his clothing was<br /><br />\nundisturbed. However, upon<br />\ncloser examination doctors at<br />\nUnion Memorial Hospital discovered a small bullet wound in<br />\nthe left side of the victim's<br />\nhead. The wound had been<br />\nobscured by the victim's hair.<br />\nPolice believe that Barnes<br />\nwas killed elsewhere and that his<br />\nbody was, to quote Major<br />\nLarkin, \"probably dumped\" on<br />\nSan Martin Drive from an<br />\nautomobile. Police are uncertain<br />\nhow long the victim had been<br />\ndead, but, according to Larkin,<br />\n\"it couldn't have been very<br />\nlong.\" No solid clues as to the<br />\nidentity of the killers have yet<br />\nbeen found, but an investigation<br />\nis continuing.<br /><br />\nTwo Assaulted<br />\nNear Garland<br />\nBY LINDSAY KAPLAN<br /><br />\nMajor Larkin<br /><br />\nTwo incidents of physical<br />\nassault were reported to Campus<br />\nSecurity recently.

The<br />\nStudent Constitution, which is<br />\npredominant, requires a unanimous vote of the Student<br />\nCouncil to close meetings of<br />\nstanding committees, which include the Student Activities<br />\nCommission and presumably its<br />\nown subcommittee, the Executive Board.<br />\nAsked why discussion about expenditures of student<br />\nfunds are closed to the student<br />\nbody, SAC Chairman Karl Block<br />\nanswered, \"Because they're not<br />\nopen.\" Student Council President George Connolly, who<br />\nintroduced the motion to close<br />\nthe meeting, argued that the<br />\nBoard must meet in secret<br />\nsession in order to discuss<br />\n\"personalities\", that is, SAC<br />\nclub officers who submit requests for allocations.<br />\nBlock had stated earlier<br /><br />\nthat not only were meetings to<br />\nbe held in closed session, but<br />\ndecisions of the Board and the<br />\nSAC budget itself were to be<br />\nsecret except for the annual<br />\nratification by the SAC and<br />\nStudent Council. At the meeting, however,Connolly promised<br />\nthat the actions of the Executive<br />\nBoard would be published by<br />\nthe Council.<br /><br />\nOther members of the<br />\nExecutive Board are Mike Banton, Steve Brown, Jeff Earle,<br />\nand Greg Pecoraro, who were<br />\nelected by the SAC membership,<br />\nand Director of Student Activities Chris Colombo.<br />\nAmong the actions of the<br />\nExecutive Board yesterday was<br />\nan allocation of at least $189 to<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br /><br />\nwas gone by the time Campus<br />\nPatrol reached the scene.<br />\nThe next day another<br />\nwoman was opening her car<br />\nwhen a man, again with a knife<br />\ngrabbed her, got into the car and<br />\npulled her in after him. Assuring<br />\nthe woman that he would not<br />\nharm her, he told her to drive<br />\nhim to Eastpoint: upon arriving<br />\nthere he simply left the vehicle.<br />\nThe woman had been neither<br />\nphysically harmed, or verbally<br />\nthreatened.

He referred<br />\nto the furor last year when the<br />\nMed School accepted only nine<br />\nHopkins undergraduates, most<br />\nof them in the accelerated<br />\nprogram, and promised, \"You'll<br />\nget a good shake. We tend to go<br />\nwith those we know best.\"<br />\nAnderson told the attentive pre-meds how they would<br />\nbe evaluated by medical school<br />\nadmissions committees, even as<br />\nhe despaired at flaws in the<br />\nsystem. \"Play the game.\" was<br />\nhis advice when asked how to<br />\nanswer application questions.<br />\n\"I've told you categorically that I don't believe in the<br />\nMCAT.\" he said, pointing out<br />\nthat the new format has been in<br />\nuse only three years. Explaining<br />\nthat the MCAT covers a broad<br />\nspectrum of subject material, he<br />\nadded, \"People at Homewood<br />\nwho start at the cell and work<br />\ndown are at a disadvantage.\"<br />\nAlthough unwilling to endorse preparation courses such<br />\nas Stanley Kaplan's, Anderson<br />\nhinted that applicants should<br />\nprepare in some way for the<br />\nMCAT's. The Kaplan service is<br />\nexpensive, but offers sample test<br />\nquestions taken from past<br />\nMCAT's. Anderson said that<br />\nmost medical schools require a<br />\nminimum average score of nine.<br />\nAnderson outlined the<br />\ncontroversy over New York<br />\nState's `truth in testing' law,<br />\nwhich requires that corrected<br />\ncopies of standardized tests be<br />\n\u2022returned to the students. The<br />\ncorporation which administers<br />\nthe MCAT claims that disclosure<br />\nwould exhaust its stock of<br />\nquestions and announced that<br />\ntest centers will no longer be<br />\noffered in New.York. Similar<br />\nlegislation is under consideration<br />\nin Maryland and in Congress.<br />\nThe Director of Admissions cited statistics to demonstrate that one's chances of<br />\nadmission to medical school vary<br />\non the basis of state residency.<br />\nEven 'private' colleges receive<br />\nstate funds and therefore favor<br />\nresidents. Some applicants are<br />\nvirtually assured of admission to<br />\na state medical college. Other<br />\nstates, including those in the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Region, produce<br />\nmore applicants to medical school<br />\nthan they have seats to offer.<br />\nOn the bright side, applications<br />\nto medical schools peaked early<br />\nin the decade and have declined<br />\nabout 10% each year since.<br />\nApplicants were advised<br />\nnot to submit `cute' or sarcastic<br />\nessays on the application form.<br />\nResponses should be credible;<br />\nfor example, interest professed<br />\nin a particular school will have<br />\nmore impact if one cites a<br />\nparticular program or professor.<br />\nAnderson said that applicants<br />\ncan expect to be questioned at<br />\nthe interview on the subject<br />\nof their essays.<br />\nAt Hopkins, a pencil and<br />\npaper are provided at the interview so that the applicant can<br />\ndetail his research work or the<br />\nlike by sketching molecular<br /><br />\nstructures, etc. Other medical<br />\nschools use 'stress' techniques at<br />\nthe interview, such as rapid<br />\nquestioning by several admissions officers.<br />\nAnderson stated that there<br />\nis a linear correlation between<br />\nGPA and acceptance to medical<br />\nschool, 3.1 being the minimum,<br />\nbut expressed doubt that the<br />\nGPA is a good predictor of<br />\nsuccess. One's grade in organic<br />\nchemistry may be a better<br />\nindication of first year performance in medical school, according to Anderson.<br />\nAnderson urged applicants<br />\nto withdraw any pending applications once they are admitted<br />\nto the school of their choice, in<br />\norder that those slots can be<br />\nfilled.

I will deal with Mr.<br />\nMoritz' glaring contradiction<br /><br />\nfirst and get that out of the way.<br />\nMr. Moritz insists that the<br />\nChaplain's Office should be<br />\nnon-political. I challenge him to<br />\nname one religious institution<br />\nthat does not, somewhere along<br />\nthe line, come into contact and<br />\ndeal with political issues. The<br />\nfact is, that the primary function<br />\nof religion is to assist in the<br />\nfulfillment of people's spiritual<br />\nneeds. People's spiritual needs<br />\nhave much to do with their daily<br />\nlives, and that includes most<br />\npolitical issues, because they do<br />\naffect people. The first step to<br />\ndeal with these needs is to be<br />\ninformed about them.<br />\nThe<br />\nChaplain's Office provides information that would otherwise<br />\nbe hard to get.<br />\nYou want the \"other side\"?<br />\nThat's easy to find on this<br />\ncampus. Just go to class and<br />\nlisten to most of the professors.<br />\nTalk to any member of the<br />\nadministration. Buy a newspaper<br />\nor a magazine, turn on the radio<br />\nor TV. It's the Chaplain's Office<br />\nthat gives this campus a semblance of balance on political<br />\nissues.<br />\nMr. Moritz, in your next<br />\nfour years here, if you are<br />\nobservant, you will notice this<br />\npattern in the work of the<br />\nChaplain's Office: It's priorities<br />\nare to meet people's needs, on<br />\nand off campus, that are not<br />\nbeing attended to by anyone<br />\nelse. These may be material--for<br />\ninstance, the Chaplain's Office<br />\ncan always be counted on to<br />\nwork with relief efforts for disaster victims through food<br />\nand clothing drives; or non<br />\nmaterial--such as the Tutorial<br />\nProject or the informative seminars available to interested Hopkins students.<br />\nAnd one last thing you<br />\nmight notice: anything sponsored by the Chaplain's Office has<br />\nthe whole-hearted support of Dr.<br />\nWickwire and the entire staff.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nJ.

He<br />\nwrote concerning the essentially<br />\nbiased political leanings of the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain.<br />\nFirst of all, I would like to<br />\npoint out that aside from<br />\npicking up a copy of the Lowdown, attending two Sunday<br />\nExperiences, and one Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix, I have had no<br />\naffiliation with the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice whatsoever. My comments are purely those of an<br />\ninterested student.<br />\nIt appears to me that what<br />\nis most crucial about Mr.<br />\nMoritz's arguments is his main<br />\nassumption that the realms of<br />\npolitics and religion are, and<br />\nought to be, separate entities.<br />\nOn the merely practical level, this<br />\nhardly seems possible. Political,<br />\nreligious, economic, indeed, any<br />\nsocial system is ultimately based<br />\non, interacts within, and creates<br />\nmodifications in a shared value<br />\nstructure. To separate religion<br />\nfrom politics in terms of no<br />\nnationally sanctioned orthodoxy, is far from prohibiting the<br />\nreligious communities from actively following the dictates of<br />\ntheir consciences in all matters<br />\npolitical or not. In fact, I would<br />\nhope that this separation would<br />\ntend to facilitate such grass roots<br />\nparticipation in politics.<br />\nReligion was never intended<br />\nas a barrier behind which we can<br />\nretreat from the evils of our<br />\nworld, but rather as a structure<br />\nthrough which we can identify<br />\nand actively strive to end those<br />\nevils. When John quoted Christ<br />\nas saying, \"...You will know the<br />\ntruth, and the truth will make<br />\nyou free,\" he was recording<br />\nwhat is perhaps one of the<br />\nmost unequivocal statements in<br />\nthe New Testament. Freedom is<br />\nnot ours to accept or reject, and<br />\nneither are the responsibilities<br />\nwhich accompany it.<br />\nI am<br />\npersonally very grateful that in<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office there are<br />\nthose who \"know the truth\",<br />\nand fully accept the responsibilities of freedom.<br />\nFinally, to think that such<br />\npolitical activities are allowed to<br />\npersist in an institution so<br />\nrepresentative of the monied<br />\ninterests of this country, is one<br />\nof the few indications I have had<br />\nwhile at Hopkins that our<br />\nmorally stagnant culture has<br />\nsome hope for the future.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nGerald Macdonald<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt's October and the leaves are turning brown. It is a season of<br />\nchange \u2014 the clear, cold death of winter shines ahead of us.<br />\nSoon we will be able to see our breath, frisk with small dogs in<br />\nthe snow, and roll our cars over on patches of black ice.

So go buy one now at, your local newsstand or<br />\nbookstore before David Frost starts nipping people's noses,<br />\nmaking it a pain to go outside.<br /><br />\nKarl Moritz raised a question meaningful for everyone<br />\nfrom atheists to Jesus freaks in<br />\nhis 9/29/79 letter to the editor:<br />\nHow involved should religious<br />\ninstitutions be with the rest of<br />\nsociety?<br />\nStating that \"it is<br />\ncertainly wrong to have certain<br />\npolitical viewpoints sponsored<br />\nby the Office of the Chaplain...\", the letter claims that the<br />\nChaplain's office should be<br />\nnon-political and non-partisan.<br /><br />\nHis argument that religion<br />\nbelongs'in chu-rches and temples<br />\nand should not enter into<br />\npolitics (into the structuring of<br />\nsociety) is as repugnant as the<br />\nargument that women belong in<br />\nthe house and should not enter<br />\nthe work force.<br />\nReligions are in large part<br />\nethical codes concerning how<br />\npeople should relate. The major<br />\nworld religions hold a vision of a<br />\nsociety where people behave<br />\nmore kindly to one another than<br />\nwe do now. So why is a religious institution wrong for trying to do a little bit to help<br />\nmake society more humane. A<br />\nlot of people, including me<br />\nadmittedly, believe that society<br />\nshould be more humane but<br />\ndon't do a hell of a lot to change<br />\nit<br />\nThe Chaplain's office works<br />\nto bring non-denominational<br />\nreligious beliefs to bear on<br />\nsociety. This is the extent of the<br />\nOffice's involvement in politics<br />\nand I see nothing, wrong with it.<br />\nIt's ret'reshing to see people who<br />\ndo more with religion than pay<br />\nan offering and lip service one<br />\nday a week and go on living<br />\nhypocritically the rest of the<br />\ntime.<br />\nIt's good to see people<br />\ndiscard alienation and work to<br />\nimprove society. It's political<br />\nfor the Chaplain's Office to run<br />\nits program tutoring underpriviledged kids. Does the fact that<br />\nit's political make it wrong?<br />\nMr. Moritz objects if the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain is using<br />\nhis money to get involved in<br />\npolitics (i.e. suggesting boycotting J. P. Stevens products<br />\nbecause Stevens is one of the<br />\nmost flagrant violators of the<br />\nway non-denominational religious beliefs say people should<br />\ntreat one another). What is<br />\nwrong with taking a stand on<br />\nissues that involve your beliefs?<br />\nMr. Moritz clearly differs<br />\nwith some of the stands the nondenominational Office of the<br />\nChaplain takes. If the Office<br />\nwere to avoid taking stand on<br />\npolitical issues, it would be<br />\nshirking its duties as a spokesgroup for the common elements<br />\nof religion. God has not endorsed the political status quo<br />\n(though rumor has it s/he is<br />\nconsidering endorsing Ted Kennedy).<br />\nSeriously, not all of us at<br />\nHopkins are going to agree with<br />\nevery stand the 0. C. takes, just<br />\nas I'm sure not all of us agree<br />\nwith the way Hopkins spends<br />\nand invests its (our) bucks (so<br />\nthat you and I support racism in<br />\nSouth Africa, for instance).<br />\nIf the Chaplain's Office<br />\nwere to avoid taking a stand<br />\nbecause not all of us agree with<br />\nit, the 0.C. would become what<br />\nmany American religious institutions are today: spineless in<br />\nliving up to their ethical/religious codes, and ineffective in<br />\nsetting an example and in<br />\ncreating a structure through<br />\nwhich those who purport to<br />\nbelieve in their codes demonstrate their beliefs by their<br />\nactions.<br />\nBruce Smith '80<br /><br />\nMary<br />\nFrat<br />\nClarke<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn response to that great<br />\nfeminist tract of September 29,<br />\n\"Frat Strategy,\" this housewife-politico would appreciate<br />\nthe chance to correct the few,<br />\nfaltering attempts at fact which<br />\ninsinuated themselves into the<br />\notherwise distracting rhetoric \u2022<br />\n(cf, Mixed Metaphors, Hyperbole, et. al.).

It<br />\nis, as we say,\"legally sufficient.\"<br />\nProposed amendments would, of<br />\ncourse, be considered by the<br />\nCommittee (cf Lawyer Referral<br />\nService). Furthermore, a bill<br />\nwhich has not yet been scheduled for hearing is unlikely to be<br />\nvoted on as soon as City Council<br />\nreconvenes on October 8 (cf<br />\nAmerican History 101).

While the plates go to press, we mount<br />\nour dented chariot for a short cruise through<br />\nWestminster (Aha! There's the Elvis statue!) to<br />\nthe land of greasy coffee and black eggs.

It's the<br />\nkind of novel that would look nice under<br />\na Christmas tree or, even better, adorning<br />\none. But, like an ornament, the shimmer<br />\nquickly fades and leaves you taking it<br />\napart trying to figure out just what you<br />\nfound so intriguing in the first place.<br />\nAnd, in the end, you wind up with shreds<br />\nof tinsel and cardboard and nothing left<br />\nto do but throw the mess away. John<br />\nIrving's The World According to Carp is<br />\njust that -- a book asking to be thrown<br />\naway.<br />\nBut the novel purported to be<br />\n\"America's most jubilant best seller!\"is<br />\nvery 'sly. John Irving is a master prose<br />\nstylist who knows how to trap the reader<br />\nin his tale. He's also got his finger on the<br />\nAmerican public's pulse \u2014 its hunger for<br />\nnews about its eccentric self. The book<br />\nbegins,\"Garp's mother, Jenny Fields, was<br />\narrested in Boston in 1942 for wounding<br /><br />\na man in a movie theater,\" and leads us<br />\non through a picaresque tale of an<br />\nindependent nurse who seizes her opportunity to have a fatherless child<br />\nby sitting on a vegetable-minded sergeant's last erection. The preposterous<br />\nplot touches every eccentric extreme as<br />\nthe nurse and her son involve themselves<br />\nwith tongueless feminists, child molesters,<br />\ntranssexual football players and many<br />\nother typical products of the brutal<br />\ninsanity of the modern world.<br />\nBy dangling those lurid tidbits<br />\nbefore our eyes, Irving nearly manages to<br />\nmake us care about his characters and<br />\nmanipulate us into accepting his inanely<br />\ninnocuous conclusion that though \"we<br />\nare all terminal cases,\" \"we must have<br />\nenergy.\" Toward the middle of the book,<br />\nwe slowly begin to realize Irving's empty<br />\nprofundity and actual purpose \u2014 the<br />\ndestructive mockery of America, of<br />\nwriters, and of himself. Irving's hero,<br />\nCarp (Jenny's son)is a writer, or rather,<br />\na would-be writer. His Kafka-esque tales,<br />\nfaithfully \"re-printed\" in full in the<br /><br />\nnovel, are poorly written and boring, and<br />\nhis adolescent attempts at plotting make<br />\nhim sound like a washed-out Holden<br />\nCaulfield.<br />\nBut Irving's self-destructiveness<br />\nis most manifest in his point-of-view. Of<br />\ncourse, nothing in a novel is there without a purpose, but Irving smears this in<br />\nour faces by his omnipresent use of the<br />\nconstruction, \"would become\": not only<br />\ndoes he spoil the suspense, he even rips<br />\naway the illusion of it. Irving does this<br />\nmore and more frequently as he realizes<br />\nthat his story is going nowhere. The<br />\nplot's tragedies become harsher and more<br />\nabsurd and the characters die ridiculous<br />\ndeaths as Irving quickly drops his facade<br />\nof omniscient narrator and assumes that<br />\nwhich he has secretly nursed all along -God. The World According to Garp is the<br />\ngospel of modern life.<br />\nIlls gospel, this distorted truth<br />\nabout a failed writer in a failed world,<br />\ndisintegrates precisely the way the story<br />\ndoes \u2014 because of modernity's lack of<br />\nnerve. Irving's attempt at mythologizing<br /><br />\nazel<br />\n\u2022 American lite clearly reveals the temporariness of our society, a \"world\" of<br />\npettiness, unimportant values and writers<br />\nthrowing together slick but shallow<br />\nbest-sellers. If The World According to<br />\nGarp had tried to offer new solutions or<br />\ninsights, John Irving's considerable talent<br />\nmight have served some purpose. By<br />\nflashing the tinsel, by fooling us with<br />\nclever sleight-of-hand, Irving has knowingly written a book that will flicker and<br />\nfade -- leaving us staring at the Garp-filled<br />\nwastebasket with the sugarstupid satisfaction of having consumed over 600 pages<br />\nof mental junk food.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 13<br /><br />\nDylan's Train Arrives<br />\nBY DAVE ARMSTRONG<br />\nBob Dylan has been making<br />\nrecords for 17 years now. Slow Train<br />\nCorning is, in my opinion, the best record<br />\nhe's ever made.<br />\nSources close to Dylan have been<br />\nsaying that for the past few months he has<br />\nbeen attending a Bible-study group led<br />\nby a fundamentalist preacher. Along<br />\nwith these confirmed repprts came some<br />\nrumors - that Dylan had veen \"born<br />\nagain\", that Dylan had been baptized in<br />\n(of all places) Pat Boone's pool; that<br />\nDylan was going to retire, ad nauseum.<br />\nIt is apparent from listening to<br />\nSlow Train Corning that Dylan has, in<br />\nfact been doing some Bible-reading; the<br />\ntitles alone suggest that, with songs like<br />\n\"Gotta Serve Somebody\", \"Gonna<br />\nChange My Way of Thinking\", and<br />\n\"When He Returns.\" However, the<br />\nsubject matter of the lyrics doesn't<br />\nmatter. Dylan has delivered, in one<br />\nbreathtaking swoop, the most cohesive<br />\nartistic statement he's ever made.<br />\nThe songs are incisive, biting<br />\ncommentaries on American society. Dylan now has the opportunity and the<br />\ninsight to be as unflinchingly honest as he<br />\never was with \"Blowin' In The Wind\" and<br />\n\"The Times They Are A-Changing\", and<br />\nhe's responded by surpassing his old<br />\nheights. \"Slow Train\" is probably the<br />\nbest example of this awesome eloquence and also contains the most chilling set of<br />\nlines on the album: \"Take a look around<br />\nyou/ You're sure to be embarassed\".<br />\nThere is not a bad cut on the<br />\nentire album. Side One opens with<br />\n\"Gotta Serve Somebody\", a slow, bluesy,<br />\nhaunting piece. It comes across as a<br />\nwarning, like a revivalist sermon of fire<br /><br />\nand brimstone. Driven by Barry Beck- Budokan, the album immediately precedett's ekectric piano, Dylan growls out the ing this one. (As a matter of fact, the<br />\nlyrics with the most confidence and same stylistic shifts which mark Slow<br />\nself-assurance he's ever displayed. \"Pre- Train Coming are discernable in embryoncious Angel\", which follows, is a beauti- ic form on that album).<br />\nThe album's closer, \"When He<br />\nful folk -rich melody around which<br />\nDylan has woven his \"new style\" lyrics, Returns\",- is a surprising, spiritually-influsuch as \"You know I just can't make enced piece with Barry Beckett' providing<br />\nit by myself / I'm a little too blind to Dylan's sole accompaniment on acoustic<br />\npiano. Dylan half-shouts it, singing with<br />\nsee\".<br />\n\"Gonna Change My Way of the;ame maniacal fervor that characterizes<br />\nThinking\" is a surprising stylistic twist. black spirituals.

Mark Knopfler and<br />\nPick Withers of Dire Straits provide the<br />\nguitar and drum work, while the aforementioned Barry Beckett does his usual<br />\nsuperb job on keyboards. Producer Jerry<br />\nWexler adds the finishing touches; probably because of his influence, this is the<br />\nmost polished and commercial record<br />\nthat ,Dylan has ever made. Dylan has<br />\nnever been so meticulous about his<br />\nattangements (if you disagree, listen to<br />\nStreet Legal, his previous solo album, and<br />\ncompare.)<br />\nThis album, more than any other,<br />\ndemonstrates Bob Dylan's greatness. The<br />\nsongs are brilliantly and meticulously<br />\nconstructed; Dylan's playing and singing<br />\nare far better than they have ever been;<br />\nthe band working with him is the best<br />\nhe's ever had; and the production of the<br />\nentire album is flawless.

It was all<br />\nthere: the sounds of banging mixed<br />\nwith whispers of \"hey man, wanna buy<br />\nsome Panama Red?\"; the crowd yelling<br />\nand lighting matches and farting; the<br />\nsmells of dope, Mennen antiperspirant,<br />\npuke, beer, ten-year-old sweatshirts, and<br />\nsinged hair (from the matches); and<br />\nabove all, the 115 decibel wall of soundwaves from the two renowned heavy<br />\nmetal bands.<br />\nThe reputations of Rainbow and<br />\nBlue Oyster Cult promised a night of<br />\nreal headbanger music (as News-Letter<br />\nrockcritic Steve Randall calls it), and<br />\nthis promise was more or less fulfilled.<br />\nRainbow, in case you Hoppie nerds<br />\ndon't know, is simply the showcase for<br />\nguitarist Ritchie Blackmore and his ego<br />\ntrips. Since Blackmore was the main<br />\ncreative force for the late great Deep<br />\nPurple, Rainbow is usually pretty good<br />\nAnd since<br />\nasskicking heavy metal.<br />\nDeep Purple was known for its dynamic<br />\nstage shows, it follows that Rainbow<br />\nshould be equally exciting. I was in<br /><br />\nLondon this summer when the new<br />\nRainbow album came out and heard a<br />\nradio interview with Cozy Powell (drummer for Rainbow); when it was mentioned that Roger Glover (another<br />\nex-Purple) was the new bassist for the<br />\ngroup, I thought, hey, like it's almost as<br />\nif D.P. was back on its feet again, and<br />\nwe fossils from the heavy metal age<br />\ncould plug in our headphones for a good<br />\nfreaking. So, there were great expectations for the Rainbow set.<br />\nBlue Oyster Cult was another<br />\nmatter entirely. Before 1976 (i.e. before<br />\n\"Agents of Fortune\") the Cult played<br />\nsome of the heaviest metal around. But<br />\nlately their stuff has been kind of bland:<br />\nsomeone had put a leash on their trademark \"Charge of the Guitar Brigade\"<br />\nstyle. However, the Cult has always had a<br />\ngood live set, and their laser/light show<br />\nwas reputed to be second to none. So, I<br />\nexpected that either they would play a<br />\nlot of their oldies, and blow the roof off<br />\nthe Civic Center, or play mostly new cuts,<br />\nwhich would bore us to tears.<br />\nAnd now to see who was the<br />\nbetter of the two bands: the envelope, please... and the winner is the Blue<br />\nOyster Cult, by a mile; sorry Ritchie,<br />\nonly Starkist makes tunafish from oranges! Anyway, Rainbow, to me (an<br /><br />\nA Slice ofthe 60's<br />\nBY ROSALIND RESNICK<br />\nSixties nostalgia has become the<br />\ntopic of innumerable cocktail parties and<br />\neditorials in the past few years. Successful<br />\nmembers of the \"Cynical Seventies\"<br />\napathetic, material culture now long for<br />\nthe days of Flower Power, marches on<br />\nWashington, civil rights, worker-student<br />\nsolidarity and hash brownies. There's no<br />\ngoing back, of course, but there is a place<br />\nfor the True Believer to go\u2014The Bread and<br />\nRoses Coffeehouse, a little hole-in- the-wall<br />\nin Waverly, off 31st and Greenmount.<br />\nThe Coffeehouse, a 60' by 25'<br />\nrectangular room with a bar on the side,<br />\nis plastered with leftist political literature<br />\nof all kinds-- women's rights, gay rights,<br />\nworker's rights, anti-nuke, co-ops, clinics,<br />\nand freedom for political prisoners. The<br />\nwalls are lined with bookshelves and<br />\nmagazine racks stuffed with \"alternative<br />\nperiodicals.\" Beside the big bulletin board<br />\nis a sunrise mural with a Chesapeake<br />\nEnergy Alliance banner draped over it;<br />\nbeside the bar is a big, circular mirror and<br />\na \"Free Angela Davis\" poster. The<br />\ndonated chairs and tables include every<br />\nconceivable style, and you can sit there<br />\nand munch your home-made goodies<br />\nfrom the Natural Foods Co-op across the<br />\nstreet while listening to the New Wave<br />\nband in the dim light of the wine-bottled<br /><br />\ncandles.<br />\nBread and Roses preserves pretty<br />\nmuch the same atmosphere it had in 1975<br />\nwhen it was opened by several members<br />\nof the New American Movement, a<br />\nDemocratic Socialist organization. They<br />\nnamed the place Bread and Roses after a<br />\nlabor movement slogan taken from a<br />\n1912 strike against the textile industries.<br />\nToday, the Coffeehouse is run by a<br />\n\"workers' council\" consisting of Chris<br />\nStadler, a day-care worker and distributor<br />\nof leftist literature; Linda Scheetz,<br />\nanother day-care worker; and Joel Killgore, a baker's apprentice. According to<br />\nStadler, the Coffeehouse's purpose is to<br />\n\"be a real community center\" where<br />\npeople can \"talk, get to know one another, play games, read a book.., and be<br />\ntogether in a free way.\" Stadler also sees<br />\nthe Coffeehouse as an \"information<br />\ncenter and resource facility.., for social<br />\nchange.\"<br />\nThe members of the \"workers'<br />\ncouncil\" insist they work \"with\" the<br />\nCoffeehouse and not \"for\" it. No one is<br />\npaid for working there, and all decisions<br />\nare reached through concensus, not<br />\nvoting. According to Stadler, the Coffeehouse sponsors most events itself but<br />\nsometimes rents the hall to those groups<br />\nwho support \"freedom, justice, and<br />\nequality uppermost in practice\" and are<br /><br />\nold metalphile), was quite disappointing. Blackmore was undoubtedly ticked<br />\nabout being the opener, and this probably had some effect on the set. The<br />\nband plowed through its numbers with a<br />\nminimum of frills, doing only tracks<br />\nfrom its new album Down to Earth.<br />\nThe Baltimorons loved 'em, though--the<br />\nsigns \"Blackmore is No. 1\" and \"Rainbow\" were all over the place, and the lead<br />\nvocalist had them stomping and yelling<br />\nand lighting matches. On All Night Love<br />\nthe audience got to do some of its own<br />\nsinging; \"Love's No Friend of Mine\" also<br />\nbrought a frenzied response from the<br />\ngrunge-crazed crowd. However, instrumentals dominated the major portion of<br />\nthe 50-m in ute set. These included<br />\nsegments of \"A Light in the Black\",<br />\n\"Come on All Ye Faithful\"(!),\"The Star<br />\nSpangled Banner\" (who does Blackmore<br />\nthink he is, Hendrix?!) and Tchaikovsky's<br />\n\"1812 Overture\" (!!) on synthesizer with<br />\ncrashing drums at the climax.., this was<br />\nprobably the best part of the whole<br />\nRainbow show, with some wild lights<br />\nwreaking havoc on organist Don Earle.<br />\nThe band then disappeared to a soft<br />\nchorus of \"Over the Rainbow\", and<br />\ntotally ignored the fans' cries for an<br />\nencore.<br />\nRainbow is extremely com-petent,<br />\nand Ritchie Blackmore is, despite his<br />\nfaults, an incredible guitarist. I'm sure<br />\nthat the band's main set would be much<br />\nmore exciting; I mean, what does one<br />\nfrom<br />\nan<br />\nexpect<br />\nopening<br />\nact?<br />\nThe Blue Oyster Cult more than made<br />\nup for the disappointing Rainbow set.<br />\nComing on about half an hour Sfter the<br />\nlast strains of \"Over the Rainbow\"<br />\nhad died away, the Cult immediately<br />\nlaunched into a searing version of\"Dominance and Submission\" (from their<br />\nclassic Secret Treaties album). Right off,<br />\nit had the crowd shouting part of the<br />\nchorus (\"dominance... dominance... \").<br />\nThen came a track from the new album<br />\nMirrors, called \"Dr. Musik\". It, too, was<br />\nwell-received by the crowd. Then, a little<br />\nrap with the crowd: \"Don't want you all<br />\nto get paranoid that we're not going to<br />\nplay your old favourites,\" and hit \"Cities<br />\n\"consistent with movements for people's<br />\nfreedom... and the removal of class<br />\ndistinctions.\" In the past, Bread and<br />\nRoses has presented folk nights (where<br />\nyou bring your musical instruments and<br />\njam), poetry readings, pot luck suppers,<br />\nsolo guitarists, folk singers, bluegrass,<br />\nreggae, and New Wave bands, art films,<br />\nand a slide show on \"Lesbian Sexual<br />\nImagery in the Fine Arts.\"<br />\nDespite the heavy political emphasis, most of the late 20's crowd that<br />\ncomes to the Coffeehouse is not politically active, Stadler says. Last Saturday<br />\nnight people came to the \"Anti-Nuke/Anti-Disco\" mainly to hear the \"New<br />\nWave\" sound of Baltimore's local group,<br />\nThe Reason. According to group member<br />\nJ.D. Considine, The Reason is not especially anti-disco, but its lead singer is<br />\nstrongly committed to the anti-nuclear<br />\ncause and has given six or seven free<br />\nconcerts to raise money for it. The<br />\nReason's music was loud and upbeat, and<br />\nthe lead singer's vibrant charisma sparked<br />\nthe atmosphere for the crowd's loose,<br />\nsixties-style rocking.<br />\nThough Stadler and the rest of the<br />\n\"workers' council\" try to provide music<br />\nthat will \"make people think,\" they don't<br />\nalways succeed. Stadler concedes that<br />\nsometimes the Coffeehouse is little<br />\ndifferent from commercial bars and disco<br />\nparlors. Nervertheless, Bread and Roses<br />\nplans to \"k tep looking for new culture<br />\nand creative culture.., with social cause<br />\nrelation.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 15<br />\non Flame\". And so it went,\"Extraterrestrial Intelligence,\" \"Buck's Boogie\" (an<br />\noldie guitar workout by Donald Roeser.<br />\nalias Buck Dharma), \"The Last Days of<br />\nMay\", \"Godzilla\" (the one the crowd<br />\nwas waiting for, which they performed<br />\nwith their characteristic crunching power chords), \"Hot Rails To Hell\", an<br />\nunnamed boogie featuring all five members of the band on guitars, \"Born<br />\nto be Wild\" and \"ME 262\" as their last<br />\nnumber, which was marked by the<br />\nexplosion of fireworks--an extremely<br />\nimpressive display that illuminated the<br />\nstoned crowd. On they came for an<br />\nencore, ending the night with a fiery<br />\nrendition of their epic \"Don't Fear the<br />\nReaper\". Truly fantastic.<br />\nMy only complaint was that<br />\nthe Cult did not have its famous laser<br />\nshow, but it made up for this with the<br />\nfireworks and the excellent light effects.<br />\nThe reason, I suspect, for all the oldies<br />\nplayed in the set lies behind a rumour<br />\nthat lead vocalist Eric Bloom had a sore<br />\nthroat; the old numbers do not contain<br />\nas much vocal material as the newer<br />\ntracks.
