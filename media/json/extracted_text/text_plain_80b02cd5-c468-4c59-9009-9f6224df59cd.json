You have not yet, I think,<br />\naccepted an academic role as the integral part of your<br />\nown character and your own enterprise.\"<br />\nCommager goes on to relate this new role to that<br />\nof the university, and he concludes that the university<br />\nitself must take the responsibility to further the academic<br />\nfunction of the bookstore.\"The university has an interest<br />\nin getting books into the hands of students, inculcating<br />\nin all who are connected with it the habits of buying<br />\nbooks, in lifting the level of community -literacy. It does<br />\nnot have a legitimate interest in selling toothpaste or<br />\nundershirts. These are laudible enterprises, but the Bookstore is not responsible for serving this particular convenience.\"<br />\nConsequently, says Commager, the bookstore \"no<br />\nlonger should be expected to show a profit than a university theatre of music department should be expected<br />\nto show a profit.\"<br />\nGoldman takes a wider, though no less compelling<br />\nviewpoint, when he relates the role of the Bookstore to<br />\nfile intellectually oriented members of the post-urban society which he calls Metroamerica. \"In the new role of<br />\nthe university\u2014with its special relationship to the culturally important Metroamerican group\u2014why should not<br />\ndie Campus Store be considered another and significant<br />\ndepartment of the university?<br />\n\"Nobody asks whether or not the department of<br />\nhistory or the department of zoology is a financial asset.<br />\n'Why should there not be the same attitude toward the<br />\nstore which is the surest link to the continuing and<br />\nmounting needs of an adult public?<br />\n\"Some day in some specific place, someone is going<br />\nto propose a College Store as a genuine cultural center.<br />\nI venture the opinion that you may be surprised at the<br />\nreaction. There are fresh winds stirring inside universities and outside them\u2014and it is not at all inconceivable<br />\nto me that such a plan would win the approval of the<br />\nmore advanced university administrators and even attract substantial endowment funds from Metroamericans.\"<br />\nThese observations have special validity for the<br />\nHopkins campus. With the imminent completion of a<br />\nnew bookstore, the University can insure its maximum<br />\nacademic potential is realized by reversing its current<br />\npolicy of operating to make a profit. That the profit<br />\nfrom the bookstore goes to make up deficits elsewhere<br />\nIn the budget only shows that students are being exploited, when in fact they should be given every consideration, in the purchase of essentials such as books.<br />\nFurthermore, in view of the expansion of campus<br />\nfacilities over the next twenty-five years, Hopkins will<br />\ncome to serve more and more of the intellectual community. The bookstore can and should be a primary<br />\nmeans of fulfilling this responsibility,but can be so only if<br />\nthe administration is willing to reconsider its current<br />\npolicy and take a more progressive attitude towards the<br />\nrole of the bookstore.<br />\n<br />\na__<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of<br />\n<br />\nGROUP<br />\n<br />\n11111JZ-T1/ 113 NV<br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\nEyes!

He sported two<br />\nTD's rushing and one on a pass<br />\nfrom Moore.<br />\nRohlfing scored the fourth Jay<br />\nTD on a \"freak\" pass that<br />\nbounced off the intended receiver, Larry Roberts. Rohlfing<br />\nalso gained two points for the<br />\nfrosh when he tackled a PMC<br />\nhalfback in the end zone for a<br />\nsafety. John Hicks, filling in for<br />\ninjured Dan Rosenfeld, gave a<br />\nfine performance in the fullback<br />\nslot, gaining about five yards per<br />\ncarry.<br />\nWeiss came up with the first<br />\nscore of the contest on a 36 yard<br />\njaunt in the first quarter. PMC<br />\nquickly came back with its 66<br />\nyard pass play, but they were<br />\nlater unable to stop the Frosh<br />\nJays' attack. Weiss again scored,<br />\nthis time on a one yard plunge,<br />\nthen proceeded to score a twopoint conversion. The second<br />\nquarter saw Rohlfing spill PMC<br />\nfor the safety, and Moore hit<br />\nWeiss on a 14 yard TD pass.<br />\nNeither team posted a score in<br />\nthe third period, but in the final<br />\nquarter, Hopkins and PMC both<br />\ncrossed the goal line.

You have not yet, I think,<br />\naccepted an academic role as the integral part of your<br />\nown character and your own enterprise.\"<br />\nCommager goes on to relate this new role to that<br />\nof the university, and he concludes that the university<br />\nitself must take the responsibility to further the academic<br />\nfunction of the bookstore.\"The university has an interest<br />\nin getting books into the hands of students, inculcating<br />\nin all who are connected with it the habits of buying<br />\nbooks, in lifting the level of community -literacy. It does<br />\nnot have a legitimate interest in selling toothpaste or<br />\nundershirts. These are laudible enterprises, but the Bookstore is not responsible for serving this particular convenience.\"<br />\nConsequently, says Commager, the bookstore \"no<br />\nlonger should be expected to show a profit than a university theatre of music department should be expected<br />\nto show a profit.\"<br />\nGoldman takes a wider, though no less compelling<br />\nviewpoint, when he relates the role of the Bookstore to<br />\nfile intellectually oriented members of the post-urban society which he calls Metroamerica. \"In the new role of<br />\nthe university\u2014with its special relationship to the culturally important Metroamerican group\u2014why should not<br />\ndie Campus Store be considered another and significant<br />\ndepartment of the university?<br />\n\"Nobody asks whether or not the department of<br />\nhistory or the department of zoology is a financial asset.<br />\n'Why should there not be the same attitude toward the<br />\nstore which is the surest link to the continuing and<br />\nmounting needs of an adult public?<br />\n\"Some day in some specific place, someone is going<br />\nto propose a College Store as a genuine cultural center.<br />\nI venture the opinion that you may be surprised at the<br />\nreaction.

The squad possessed an all-around attack. After<br />\nrecovering from a midseason low<br />\npoint against Western Maryland,<br />\nthe Baby Jays' spirit and enthusiasm proved strong.<br />\nDefense Impressive<br />\nLed by an improved pass coverage and strong interior line,<br />\nthe frosh defense turned out to<br />\nbe a major stumbling block for<br />\nthe PMC offense.

Steve<br />\nClark was aggressive as defensive<br />\ntackle. Nevertheless PMC was<br />\nable to connect on several passes<br />\nto the flat. One of these ended<br />\nin a 66 yard run for their first<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe Scoring Trio<br />\nRussell Moore, Paul Weiss, and<br />\nBob Rohlfing again sparked the<br />\nHopkins offense. Quarterback<br />\nMoore was 8 for 18 through the<br />\nair, and connected for two touchdowns and one conversion. Weiss<br />\ngained 173 yards in 23 attempts<br />\nfor an average of about eight<br />\nyards per carry. He sported two<br />\nTD's rushing and one on a pass<br />\nfrom Moore.<br />\nRohlfing scored the fourth Jay<br />\nTD on a \"freak\" pass that<br />\nbounced off the intended receiver, Larry Roberts. Rohlfing<br />\nalso gained two points for the<br />\nfrosh when he tackled a PMC<br />\nhalfback in the end zone for a<br />\nsafety. John Hicks, filling in for<br />\ninjured Dan Rosenfeld, gave a<br />\nfine performance in the fullback<br />\nslot, gaining about five yards per<br />\ncarry.<br />\nWeiss came up with the first<br />\nscore of the contest on a 36 yard<br />\njaunt in the first quarter. PMC<br />\nquickly came back with its 66<br />\nyard pass play, but they were<br />\nlater unable to stop the Frosh<br />\nJays' attack. Weiss again scored,<br />\nthis time on a one yard plunge,<br />\nthen proceeded to score a twopoint conversion. The second<br />\nquarter saw Rohlfing spill PMC<br />\nfor the safety, and Moore hit<br />\nWeiss on a 14 yard TD pass.<br />\nNeither team posted a score in<br />\nthe third period, but in the final<br />\nquarter, Hopkins and PMC both<br />\ncrossed the goal line. With 55<br />\nseconds remaining, Penn.
