But apparently other brooms were busy as well, and<br />\nthe publishers of HORIZONS, or at any rate the more enterprising of them, were swept from the groves of Homewood\u2014<br />\nthrough no inhospitality on the part of Homewood, we hasten<br />\nto add.<br />\nWhether they felt that their mission, which they<br />\nseemed to take very seriously, was accomplished, or whether<br />\ntheir energy was exhausted by the really rather good things<br />\nthey did accomplish, we do not know. At all events, HORIZONS lapsed. Three years have passed, and during that time<br />\nsteam has gradually accumulated again. Though the kettle may<br />\nnot be boiling furiously, nevertheless it threatens to lift the lid<br />\nwhich has settled so peacefully and unprotestingly. How high<br />\nit will jump, or how often, no one knows.<br />\nThat depends on the undergraduates, who are a very uncertain lot. Some few have responded nobly. But they have<br />\nbeen chiefly those who were already counted on. And one important reason for such a venture as a literary supplement is,<br />\nthat it may uncover some one whom it had not expected at all.<br />\nIt may even be hoped that it will encourage or stimulate such a<br />\nperson. And there is one particular direction in which it would<br />\nlike to do a little stimulating. That is toward serious prose,<br />\nnarrative or descriptive. Poets may be trusted generally to<br />\ntake care of themselves.<br />\nYoung writers seem to feel too<br />\noften that if they are not writing verse they are not writing<br />\nat all. As a matter of fact good narrative prose is quite as rare<br />\nas good verse. And on that particular subject which the undergraduate is particularly qualified to treat, it is so rare as to<br />\nbe almost non-existent. We mean intelligent artistic treatment of undergraduate life. Young writers have a bias toward the romantic, and a too modest opinion of the importance<br />\nand interest of their own activities. This is unfortunate, because few things would be more interesting than a serious study<br />\nof that large part of America which is in attendance at her huge<br />\nuniversities. Why not begin it at Hopkins? A sort of swansong, in this case; let the \"despised undergraduate\", as he has<br />\nbeen wont to call himself lately, prove, if not his right to exist,<br />\nat any rate his actual existence, which some have even dared to<br />\ndoubt.<br />\nOne principle we adhere to now, and will adhere to firmly<br />\nin the future, we hope. It has been said often since the days of<br />\nHORIZONS that what Hopkins really needs, is a literary magazine. This we venture to doubt. If Hopkins had needed a lit- \u2022<br />\nerary magazine it would have had it long ago. Such things are<br />\nnot to be forced. If they do not make themselves it is futile ai4<br />\nfoolish to try to make them. We shall not try. We are not<br />\nso ambitious as HORIZONS. We have serious doubts about<br />\nour continued existence. We hope we shall be able to retire as<br />\ngracefully as our predecessors, if we find we are not wanted.<br />\nNot that we do not want to stay. We are ambitious; we<br />\nhope we shall be energetic; still more that we shall deserve the<br />\ninterest which we have already aroused. But we cannot, or will<br />\nnot, do it by ourselves.<br />\nT. T.<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nIn relinquishing the verse to pitiless publicity, the co-ed<br />\nsuggested that it might be followed by such a Cabell-like editor's note as:<br />\n(Translation from<br />\nNicholas Guyon<br />\n1529)<br />\n<br />\nAssistant Business Managers<br />\nJunior Editors<br />\n<br />\nand N<br />\n<br />\n1897<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nBut to return to our sympathizings with the distressing<br />\nconditions of local co-ed-dom, we recall a student vote (of<br />\nwhich interesting events, by the way, there are far too few) on<br />\nthis question, conducted by the NEWS-LETTER about two<br />\nyears ago. The result was an overwhelming condemnation of<br />\nthe co-educational system, at least as applied to Hopkins. We<br />\nhave since wondered at this, and, of late, our speculations have<br />\ntaken a cynical tone.<br />\nAs we see it, there were at least five factors, of varying<br />\nimportance, behind this vote:<br />\nMen, in general, are secretly suspicious, highly skeptical<br />\nand even a little resentful of higher education for women. This<br />\nattitude probably has much to do with the preservation of superiority complexes, doubtless soundly based on social history.<br />\nAs a result, men are equally suspicious of the type of women likely to be found in co-educational institutions, i. e., where<br />\nmen are also taught, i. e., where higher education is ordinarily<br />\nhighest.<br />\nMen want to air their knowledge in mixed company as if<br />\nit were innate. Thus, the men are not anxious to have feminine eyes witness so vulgar a process as the acquiring of learning, especially when the girls are in a position to pass judgments on masculine receptivity.<br />\nIn the daily class-to-class races, .there would be little opportunity for the boys to enjoy, leisurely, the feminine society<br />\nso near and yet so far away. The girls would be a distraction,<br />\nan intriguing and insufficient glimpse.<br />\nThe day to day activity of boys is not the constantly topnotch existence that the average girl's can be, when she so<br />\ndesires.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nFoot-Note to Love<br />\nMy love is not a simple song,<br />\nA tale for children!<br />\nIt cannot guess at Right or<br />\nIt's neither weak nor brave nor Wrong,<br />\nIt won't be short or even long strong,<br />\nAs it is bidden.<br />\n<br />\nNOTICES<br />\nLACROSSE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\nThe entire staff will meet in<br />\nthe News-Letter office at 12.20<br />\non next Tuesday, for the purpose<br />\nof electing new members of the<br />\nEditorial and Business Boards.<br />\nHULLABALOO<br />\nAny men in any of the lower<br />\nclasses who want to contest for<br />\nthe Business Staff of the 1926<br />\nHullabaloo give their names, box<br />\nnumbers to Henry Turnbull or<br />\nGeorge Snoops at once.<br />\n<br />\n1925 Book Will Appear May 20; Staff<br />\nto Hold Banquet; Three<br />\nMen Make Staff<br />\n<br />\nThe 1926 Hullabaloo has signed<br />\na contract with the White Studio<br />\nof New York to make all the necessary photographs for the Annual, it was announced yesterday<br />\nby Henry R.

But apparently other brooms were busy as well, and<br />\nthe publishers of HORIZONS, or at any rate the more enterprising of them, were swept from the groves of Homewood\u2014<br />\nthrough no inhospitality on the part of Homewood, we hasten<br />\nto add.<br />\nWhether they felt that their mission, which they<br />\nseemed to take very seriously, was accomplished, or whether<br />\ntheir energy was exhausted by the really rather good things<br />\nthey did accomplish, we do not know. At all events, HORIZONS lapsed. Three years have passed, and during that time<br />\nsteam has gradually accumulated again. Though the kettle may<br />\nnot be boiling furiously, nevertheless it threatens to lift the lid<br />\nwhich has settled so peacefully and unprotestingly. How high<br />\nit will jump, or how often, no one knows.<br />\nThat depends on the undergraduates, who are a very uncertain lot. Some few have responded nobly. But they have<br />\nbeen chiefly those who were already counted on. And one important reason for such a venture as a literary supplement is,<br />\nthat it may uncover some one whom it had not expected at all.<br />\nIt may even be hoped that it will encourage or stimulate such a<br />\nperson. And there is one particular direction in which it would<br />\nlike to do a little stimulating. That is toward serious prose,<br />\nnarrative or descriptive. Poets may be trusted generally to<br />\ntake care of themselves.<br />\nYoung writers seem to feel too<br />\noften that if they are not writing verse they are not writing<br />\nat all. As a matter of fact good narrative prose is quite as rare<br />\nas good verse. And on that particular subject which the undergraduate is particularly qualified to treat, it is so rare as to<br />\nbe almost non-existent. We mean intelligent artistic treatment of undergraduate life. Young writers have a bias toward the romantic, and a too modest opinion of the importance<br />\nand interest of their own activities. This is unfortunate, because few things would be more interesting than a serious study<br />\nof that large part of America which is in attendance at her huge<br />\nuniversities. Why not begin it at Hopkins? A sort of swansong, in this case; let the \"despised undergraduate\", as he has<br />\nbeen wont to call himself lately, prove, if not his right to exist,<br />\nat any rate his actual existence, which some have even dared to<br />\ndoubt.<br />\nOne principle we adhere to now, and will adhere to firmly<br />\nin the future, we hope. It has been said often since the days of<br />\nHORIZONS that what Hopkins really needs, is a literary magazine. This we venture to doubt. If Hopkins had needed a lit- \u2022<br />\nerary magazine it would have had it long ago. Such things are<br />\nnot to be forced. If they do not make themselves it is futile ai4<br />\nfoolish to try to make them. We shall not try. We are not<br />\nso ambitious as HORIZONS. We have serious doubts about<br />\nour continued existence. We hope we shall be able to retire as<br />\ngracefully as our predecessors, if we find we are not wanted.<br />\nNot that we do not want to stay. We are ambitious; we<br />\nhope we shall be energetic; still more that we shall deserve the<br />\ninterest which we have already aroused. But we cannot, or will<br />\nnot, do it by ourselves.<br />\nT. T.<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nIn relinquishing the verse to pitiless publicity, the co-ed<br />\nsuggested that it might be followed by such a Cabell-like editor's note as:<br />\n(Translation from<br />\nNicholas Guyon<br />\n1529)<br /><br />\nAssistant Business Managers<br />\nJunior Editors<br /><br />\nand N<br /><br />\n1897<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nBut to return to our sympathizings with the distressing<br />\nconditions of local co-ed-dom, we recall a student vote (of<br />\nwhich interesting events, by the way, there are far too few) on<br />\nthis question, conducted by the NEWS-LETTER about two<br />\nyears ago. The result was an overwhelming condemnation of<br />\nthe co-educational system, at least as applied to Hopkins. We<br />\nhave since wondered at this, and, of late, our speculations have<br />\ntaken a cynical tone.<br />\nAs we see it, there were at least five factors, of varying<br />\nimportance, behind this vote:<br />\nMen, in general, are secretly suspicious, highly skeptical<br />\nand even a little resentful of higher education for women.
