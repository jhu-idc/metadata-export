When the war is over,<br />\nthese are the men who will step into<br />\nthe best civilian positions and receive<br />\nthe promotions.

At this concert was the<br />\npremiere of Ellington's jazz tone<br />\npoem, Black, Brown and Beige, a<br />\nMusical delineation,of the history of<br />\nthe Negro in America. Mike Levin,<br />\nmusic critic of Downbeat says this of<br />\nthe concert: The Duke is working towards music where he can use all the<br />\nrich scoring and harmonic advantages of the classical tradition, plus<br />\nthe gusto, poignance and emotional<br />\ndrive of great hot jazz, specifically<br />\nthe solo . . . The concert was a synthesis of everything the Duke has<br />\nbeen able to learn from the history<br />\nof music, his own rich background<br />\nand that of his men in the great<br />\nNegro tradition, plus the personal<br />\nFIllington band.'<br />\nEllington and his orchestra are<br />\ngenerally considered to be among the<br />\nmost versatile musical organizations<br />\nin America. His rhythm specials are<br />\nwell known among jazz fans. But<br />\nhe also has quite a following as a<br />\nsweet orchestra. In fact, his band<br />\nplaced fifth in Downbeat's poll for<br />\nsweet bands. He is the composer<br />\nnot only of such jazz classics as<br />\nBlack and Tan Fantasy, Creole<br />\nRhapsody, and Rockin' in Rhythm;<br />\nhe has also written such all-time<br />\nfavorites as Sophisticated Lady,<br />\nMood indigo, Solitude, I Let a Song<br />\nGo Out of My Heart, and the recent<br />\nI Got It Bad and That Ain't Good. ,<br />\nHughes Panassie, eminent French<br />\njazz critic, has this to say of Ellington: 'Duke Ellington's orchestra is<br />\ntruly an exceptional creation in the<br />\nhistory of jazz. In contrast to all<br />\nother, orchestras, it depends entirely<br />\non the leader: this orchestra is a<br />\nbody of which Duke is the head and<br />\nnerve center. However brilliant the<br />\nvarious musicians, the orchestra is<br />\nbefore all else the instrument through<br />\nwhich the Duke expresses his ideas.<br />\nFor Ellington is not, like the others,<br />\na simple arranger; he is a creative<br />\nmusician working through the medium of an entire orchestra, a musician<br />\nwho thinks in orchestral terms.'<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE TWO<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\nFounded 1897<br />\nSubscription per year<br />\n$200<br />\nBy Mad<br />\n$2 50<br />\nRemit subscription fees to Treasurer, Student Activities Council,<br />\nRernsen Hall, Postoffice, Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nPublished weekly from October to June, except during examination<br />\nand college holiday periods ky undergraduates of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBOARD OF CONTROL<br />\nJames Applegate<br />\nArnold Harberger<br />\nLeo Flaslinian<br />\nDavid Jeffreys<br />\nFits Dodson<br />\nCarl SchopfCr<br />\nLeonard Goodmaa_<br />\nHorace Siegler<br />\nMelvin Edelstein._<br />\nMarvin Adelson<br />\n<br />\n-Editor-iirChief<br />\nNews Eche,<br />\nMobs-up Editor<br />\nFeature Editor<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\n--Advertising Manager<br />\nSTAFF EDITORS<br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nCopy Edits',<br />\n_Eschange Editor<br />\n<br />\nREPORTERS<br />\nMarvin Adelson, Milton Glatt, Henry Siegel, Bill Smith, Joe<br />\nSchapiro, Russell Baker, Robert Chapman, Leonard Kergelman, George<br />\nWinokur, Charles Sussman, Stanley Greenfield.<br />\nBUSINESS STAFF<br />\nCarl Schopfer<br />\n__Business Manager<br />\nLeonard Goodman----_Advertising Manager<br />\nJake Schlenger<br />\nAccounting Manager<br />\nPhil Dunk<br />\n--Accounting Manager<br />\nRepresented for National Advertising by<br />\nNATIONAL ADVIRTI.ING SERVICE, INC.<br />\n420 Madison Avenue; New York City, New York<br />\n<br />\nTUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1943<br />\n<br />\nThe Future of Activities<br />\nThe meeting of the leaders of the<br />\nvarious campus activities, which is<br />\nto take place tonight, is the first<br />\nstep in trying to solve a very real<br />\nproblem which has threatened to<br />\neliminate the extracurricular life of<br />\nthe Hopkins man.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER firmly believes<br />\nthat activities are an important part<br />\nof campus life and that \\thos4who<br />\nparticipate in these activities gain<br />\na broad and practical education<br />\nvdiicli can not be gained in the class<br />\nroom alone. The war effort has,<br />\nhowever, taken away many of the<br />\n--- participants as well as much_ of the<br />\nspare time of those who remain.<br />\nThus activities and fraternities are<br />\nslowly starving to death.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER hopes that the<br />\nactivity leaders will aim at the full<br />\ncontinuation of activities after the<br />\nwar. It has been proposed that the<br />\ngirls in the College for Teachers<br />\nmay help the activities survive the<br />\nwar.<br />\nIt has been suggested that<br />\neacp activity compile a history of<br />\nitself. These histories, if carefully<br />\nwritten, will be valuable in reconstructing activities after the war.<br />\nThe activity leaders have accepted a challenge. It is right that<br />\nthey should. The NEWS-LETTER, as<br />\nwell as the other activities, is solidavor CT this attempt to solve<br />\nthe pressing problem. We hope that<br />\nout of the meeting will come some<br />\nmeans by which activities may be<br />\ncontinued during the war. We hope<br />\neven more strongly that plans will<br />\nbe made for the continuation of activities after the war if it is found<br />\nnecessary to curtail or even eliminate them for the duration.<br />\n<br />\nThe Viereck Case<br />\n<br />\nthe prosecuting attorney struck 'foul<br />\nblows' in his summing up speech by<br />\ninciting the jury to prejudice<br />\nagainst the defendant. The charge<br />\nagainst Viereck was that he had not<br />\nreported his personal activities in<br />\nbehalf of the German Library of Information, a branch of the German<br />\ngovernment; literally, the act only<br />\nrequires foreign agents to report<br />\nactivities for which they are in the<br />\npay of a foreign government.<br />\n<br />\nFrom The Bible,<br />\nKing Nassau's<br />\nTranslation<br />\n(Editorial note: We are reprinting<br />\nthe following article from the Daily<br />\nPrincetonian of January 11, 1943.)<br />\n1 Now it came to pass in the<br />\ntenth year of the reign of Roosevelt<br />\nIt, that there arose a mighty famine<br />\nin many lands.<br />\n2 And in the land of Goucher,<br />\nyea, also in that of Smith and Sarah<br />\nLawrence there was a great cry.<br />\n3 And the pantry shelves being<br />\nbare, the daughters of these lands<br />\nwere driven even unto the book<br />\nshelves.<br />\n4 (And the oldest inhabitants<br />\nshook their heads, saying: 'Lo, it<br />\nhatleysr before come to this in<br />\nour time, nor yet in the time of our<br />\nfathers.')<br />\n4 But certain daughters took council among themselves, saying: 'Behold, the Land of Nassau is a land<br />\nflowing with silk and money.

There is valuable training and<br />\nexperience to be gained from taking<br />\npart in the various activities at Hopkins, and you men who come to<br />\nschool in the morning and go<br />\nstraight home after your last class<br />\nare not getting it. It seems to me<br />\nthat we have a great enough variety<br />\nof activities here at Hopkins so that<br />\neach student should be able to find<br />\nat least one in which he is interested.<br />\nI realize the insecurity of the present situation but feel that this is all<br />\nthe more reason why you should all<br />\nparticipate in some activity now and<br />\nget what training you can from it.<br />\nBesides providing valuable training<br />\nfor after the war it will help develop<br />\nthat quality of leadership which is so<br />\nImportant in winning promotions in<br />\nthe armed services--something which<br />\nwe should all be interested in. So read<br />\nyour handbooks, find out what the<br />\nvarious activities are, select one that<br />\ninterests you, get in touch with one<br />\nof its leaders immediately.

At this concert was the<br />\npremiere of Ellington's jazz tone<br />\npoem, Black, Brown and Beige, a<br />\nMusical delineation,of the history of<br />\nthe Negro in America. Mike Levin,<br />\nmusic critic of Downbeat says this of<br />\nthe concert: The Duke is working towards music where he can use all the<br />\nrich scoring and harmonic advantages of the classical tradition, plus<br />\nthe gusto, poignance and emotional<br />\ndrive of great hot jazz, specifically<br />\nthe solo . . . The concert was a synthesis of everything the Duke has<br />\nbeen able to learn from the history<br />\nof music, his own rich background<br />\nand that of his men in the great<br />\nNegro tradition, plus the personal<br />\nFIllington band.'<br />\nEllington and his orchestra are<br />\ngenerally considered to be among the<br />\nmost versatile musical organizations<br />\nin America. His rhythm specials are<br />\nwell known among jazz fans. But<br />\nhe also has quite a following as a<br />\nsweet orchestra. In fact, his band<br />\nplaced fifth in Downbeat's poll for<br />\nsweet bands. He is the composer<br />\nnot only of such jazz classics as<br />\nBlack and Tan Fantasy, Creole<br />\nRhapsody, and Rockin' in Rhythm;<br />\nhe has also written such all-time<br />\nfavorites as Sophisticated Lady,<br />\nMood indigo, Solitude, I Let a Song<br />\nGo Out of My Heart, and the recent<br />\nI Got It Bad and That Ain't Good. ,<br />\nHughes Panassie, eminent French<br />\njazz critic, has this to say of Ellington: 'Duke Ellington's orchestra is<br />\ntruly an exceptional creation in the<br />\nhistory of jazz. In contrast to all<br />\nother, orchestras, it depends entirely<br />\non the leader: this orchestra is a<br />\nbody of which Duke is the head and<br />\nnerve center. However brilliant the<br />\nvarious musicians, the orchestra is<br />\nbefore all else the instrument through<br />\nwhich the Duke expresses his ideas.<br />\nFor Ellington is not, like the others,<br />\na simple arranger; he is a creative<br />\nmusician working through the medium of an entire orchestra, a musician<br />\nwho thinks in orchestral terms.'<br /><br />\nPAGE TWO<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\nFounded 1897<br />\nSubscription per year<br />\n$200<br />\nBy Mad<br />\n$2 50<br />\nRemit subscription fees to Treasurer, Student Activities Council,<br />\nRernsen Hall, Postoffice, Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nPublished weekly from October to June, except during examination<br />\nand college holiday periods ky undergraduates of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBOARD OF CONTROL<br />\nJames Applegate<br />\nArnold Harberger<br />\nLeo Flaslinian<br />\nDavid Jeffreys<br />\nFits Dodson<br />\nCarl SchopfCr<br />\nLeonard Goodmaa_<br />\nHorace Siegler<br />\nMelvin Edelstein._<br />\nMarvin Adelson<br /><br />\n-Editor-iirChief<br />\nNews Eche,<br />\nMobs-up Editor<br />\nFeature Editor<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\n--Advertising Manager<br />\nSTAFF EDITORS<br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nCopy Edits',<br />\n_Eschange Editor<br /><br />\nREPORTERS<br />\nMarvin Adelson, Milton Glatt, Henry Siegel, Bill Smith, Joe<br />\nSchapiro, Russell Baker, Robert Chapman, Leonard Kergelman, George<br />\nWinokur, Charles Sussman, Stanley Greenfield.<br />\nBUSINESS STAFF<br />\nCarl Schopfer<br />\n__Business Manager<br />\nLeonard Goodman----_Advertising Manager<br />\nJake Schlenger<br />\nAccounting Manager<br />\nPhil Dunk<br />\n--Accounting Manager<br />\nRepresented for National Advertising by<br />\nNATIONAL ADVIRTI.ING SERVICE, INC.<br />\n420 Madison Avenue; New York City, New York<br /><br />\nTUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1943<br /><br />\nThe Future of Activities<br />\nThe meeting of the leaders of the<br />\nvarious campus activities, which is<br />\nto take place tonight, is the first<br />\nstep in trying to solve a very real<br />\nproblem which has threatened to<br />\neliminate the extracurricular life of<br />\nthe Hopkins man.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER firmly believes<br />\nthat activities are an important part<br />\nof campus life and that \\thos4who<br />\nparticipate in these activities gain<br />\na broad and practical education<br />\nvdiicli can not be gained in the class<br />\nroom alone. The war effort has,<br />\nhowever, taken away many of the<br />\n--- participants as well as much_ of the<br />\nspare time of those who remain.<br />\nThus activities and fraternities are<br />\nslowly starving to death.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER hopes that the<br />\nactivity leaders will aim at the full<br />\ncontinuation of activities after the<br />\nwar. It has been proposed that the<br />\ngirls in the College for Teachers<br />\nmay help the activities survive the<br />\nwar.<br />\nIt has been suggested that<br />\neacp activity compile a history of<br />\nitself. These histories, if carefully<br />\nwritten, will be valuable in reconstructing activities after the war.<br />\nThe activity leaders have accepted a challenge. It is right that<br />\nthey should. The NEWS-LETTER, as<br />\nwell as the other activities, is solidavor CT this attempt to solve<br />\nthe pressing problem. We hope that<br />\nout of the meeting will come some<br />\nmeans by which activities may be<br />\ncontinued during the war.
