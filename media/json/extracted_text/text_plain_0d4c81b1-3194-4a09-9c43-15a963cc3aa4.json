After the final approval<br />\nprocess, the bill will be introduced within the next few weeks<br />\nas an \"administration bill\" filed<br />\non behalf of the Governor by<br />\n<br />\nthe Speaker of the House and<br />\nthe President of the State<br />\nSenate.<br />\nThe attractiveness of the<br />\nnew proposal, as seen by Muller,<br />\nis that \"it would not cost state<br />\ntaxpayers a cent\"; the state<br />\nlegislature need only approve the<br />\ntax exempt status to permit the<br />\nfloating of the tax free bonds.<br />\nThe bonds would be backed<br />\nsolely by the institutions that<br />\nissue them. \"We would borrow<br />\nat a lower rate than if they were<br />\ntaxable bonds and then lend to<br />\nstudents at the lower rate,\"<br />\nMuller explained. Since the new<br />\nlow interest rate requires capital,<br />\nthe extra funds will in turn come<br />\nfrom the Student Aid Budget.<br />\nHowever, according to Director<br />\nof Financial Aid Susan Broadbent, a tremendous amount of<br />\nmoney would still have to be<br />\ninvested by Hopkins to make the<br />\nbonds more attractive to prospective investors.<br />\nWoodworth also added that<br />\npassage of the bill is now necessary, because \"Reaganomics has<br />\ndriven colleges to look for other<br />\nsources of support for their<br />\nstudents.\" If the bill is passed<br />\nduring this legislative session,<br />\nthe law will be enacted June 1.<br />\nWoodworth hopes that if bond<br />\nsales proceed, the resulting student money should become<br />\navailable at Hopkins as early as<br />\nJanuary 1983.<br />\nThe state of Illinois has<br />\n<br />\nalready passed legislation under<br />\na similar plan. However, one<br />\ndrawback of the Illinois program<br />\nis that only state residents can<br />\nreceive the loans. The Hopkins<br />\nbackers of the Maryland bill are<br />\nhoping to circumvent this obstacle since a large number of<br />\nHopkins loan recipients are from<br />\nout of state.<br />\nAlthough plans to implement the loan program are still<br />\ntentative,- Broadbent feels the<br />\nprogram will be run similar to<br />\nthe Guaranteed Student Loan<br />\nProgram. However, eligibility<br />\nwould most likely only extend<br />\nto students who are now disqualified from GSLs due to the new<br />\nincome limitations imposed by<br />\nCongress.<br />\nBroadbent<br />\ndescribes as<br />\n\"frightening\" the inability to<br />\npredict exactly how much Ellery Woodworth of the Office of Governmental Affairs hopes that<br />\nthe Maryland Assembly will pass legislation to help JHU finance<br />\ncon 't. on p.7<br />\nmore student loans.<br />\n<br />\n\"Pro-Choice Teach-In\"Starts<br />\nNew Organization At JHU<br />\nBY MARTIN CARLSON<br />\nDespite rumors of a possible<br />\npro-life protest, Planned Parenthood and the Maryland Students<br />\nFor Choice organized a calm<br />\npro-choice workshop from 1 to<br />\n3 p.m. last Friday in the Garrett<br />\nRoom of the Eisenhower Li-<br />\n<br />\nCUS Approves Measure To Restore<br />\nLetter Grades For Student Research<br />\nBY KARL MORITZ<br />\n<br />\nThe new rule was prompted<br />\nby the problems that arose when<br />\nCiting \"inability to enforce \\ the CUS decided independent<br />\nthe rule,\" the Committee on research should be pass/fail,<br />\nUndergraduate Studies has de- while keeping the letter grade<br />\ncided to change the grading lp system for independent study.<br />\nsystem for independent research Professors and students were<br />\nfrom mandatory pass/fail to that quick to realize that by giving<br />\nof the standard letter grades. the group of students doing the<br />\n<br />\nStudents doing independent research may now receive letter grades.<br />\n<br />\nresearch a name and organizing<br />\nit as a class, they could use the<br />\nletter grade system. When the<br />\nCUS realized the ease with<br />\nwhich the rule was being circumvented, they decided to change<br />\nthe grades back to the letter<br />\ntype.<br />\nWhy would students want<br />\nthe added pressure of working<br />\ntoward a letter grade? According to one student currently<br />\ninvolved in research, the letter<br />\ngrade provides more incentive to<br />\ndo one's best on a project, and it<br />\nis also a better reflection of the<br />\nkind of job a student has done.<br />\nFurthermore, since the University allows a student to take<br />\nonly one class pass/fail each<br />\nsemester, any student doing<br />\nresearch does not have the<br />\nchance to take another class<br />\npass/fail.<br />\n\"I think it's to the credit of<br />\nthe CUS that if they think a rule<br />\nis unenforcable, they change it,\"<br />\nsaid Martha Roseman, Director<br />\nof Advising and Counseling.<br />\n<br />\nbrary. The date marked the<br />\nninth anniversary of the Roe vs.<br />\nWade Supreme Court decision<br />\nwhich declared abortion as a<br />\nconstitutional right.<br />\nAfter outlining the two<br />\nmajor pro-life measures presently before Congress, Jeni Schofield of Students For Choice<br />\nstated a major objection to the<br />\nHelms and Hatch proposals: a<br />\ndefinition of life beginning at<br />\nfertilization would ban the IUD<br />\nand all forms of oral contraceptives which prevent implantation<br />\nof the embryo. Schofield also<br />\npointed out that national polls<br />\nshow a majority of Americans<br />\nopposed to attempts to outlaw<br />\nabortion in this country.<br />\nIlse Darling and Robin<br />\nSchavitz of Planned Parenthood<br />\nfollowed with a presentation on<br />\ntechniques of lobbying for prochoice. They suggested telegrams, personal letters and post-<br />\n<br />\ncards, phone calls, and petitions<br />\nas excellent means of lobbying a<br />\nlegislator. But if a person wants<br />\nto go to state or national<br />\nlegislatures, Darling said that he<br />\nor she must be \"reasonable\"<br />\nand know many of the facts<br />\nunderlying the abortion controversy. She added, \"We keep<br />\nmaking<br />\nthe<br />\nstress<br />\non<br />\nchoice...we're not 'pro-abortion,'<br />\nbut we want to allow women to<br />\nchoose.\"<br />\nTo illustrate their<br />\npoints about legislative lobbying,<br />\nDarling<br />\nand Schavitz placed<br />\nthemselves in the roles of<br />\nCongresswoman and lobbyist.<br />\nAfter the speeches, the<br />\norganizers divided the audience<br />\ninto smaller groups according to<br />\nschools\u2014Homewood, the Health<br />\nInstitutions, Towson State, and<br />\nUMBC.<br />\nIn the Homewood<br />\ncorner, students discussed the<br />\ndifficulties of forming a new<br />\ncon 't. on p.7<br />\n<br />\nRepresentatives from pm-choice groups address students.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2 / JANUARY 29, 1982<br />\n<br />\nPSU Outlines FocalPoints For Spring Semester<br />\nBY SUNITA HANJURA<br />\nUnder: an organizational<br />\nplan slightly different from last<br />\nsemesters.: the Hopkins Progressive Students Union (PSU) has<br />\noutlined i:ts focal points and<br />\nplanned a! debate as well as<br />\nseveral forums aimed at informing students about, and eliciting<br />\ndiscussion of. various issues.<br />\nchief among them being increased militarism and the effect<br />\n<br />\nof federal budget cuts on higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe PSU plans a debate<br />\nwith the Young Republicans on<br />\nthe former topic: for the latter,<br />\nthey have scheduled a forum, to<br />\nbe held February 24, on cuts in<br />\neducational benefits and their<br />\neffect on the student population. Present at the forum will<br />\nbe Susan Broadbent, Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid, Jan Fein of the<br />\nU.S. Student Association, and<br />\n<br />\nGreg Paul considers this year's PSU work.<br />\n<br />\nJoel Weisman of the University<br />\nof Massachusetts at Amherst.<br />\nAccording to Philip Schmandt of<br />\nthe PSU, Weisman will provide a<br />\n\"political analysis of Reagan's<br />\nattitude and strategy\" regarding<br />\nhigher education while Fein and<br />\nBroadbent will elucidate what<br />\nthe budget cuts are in general<br />\nand how they will affect<br />\nHopkins students.<br />\nAlso related to this theme,<br />\nthe PSU plans to send a group to<br />\nthe AFSCME march in Annapolis<br />\nto be held March 13. The<br />\nHopkins demonstrators will<br />\nmarch under the slogan \"Don't<br />\nReaganize Education,\" as part of<br />\nthe \"Solidarity\" theme of the<br />\ndemonstration: \"Don't Reaganize Maryland.\"<br />\nAlthough these two issues<br />\nare the primary points of focus<br />\nfor the PSU this semester, the<br />\ngroup, with an estimated membership of forty, will address<br />\nother political issues.<br />\nOn<br />\nFebruary 10th, the Union will<br />\nhold a forum dealing with the<br />\ncrisis in Poland featuring Solidarity member Eva Hauser, a Polish<br />\nactivist who left the country in<br />\n1971.<br />\nThe group also plans to take<br />\npart in the antiwar demonstration sponsored by the Committee in Solidarity with the people<br />\nof El Salvador. The demonstration, scheduled for March 27,<br />\nwill be held at Fort Bragg, where<br />\nSalvadorean soldiers are already<br />\nbeing trained for combat and<br />\nsent to El Salvador to fight.<br />\nIn addition, the PSU, in<br />\naffiliation<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\nJHU<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Center, is dealing with<br />\nissues concerning the rights of<br />\nwomen. Cindy Stagoff of the<br />\nPSU is currently organizing a<br />\nforum on how Reagan's budget<br />\ncuts affect women. The Forum.<br />\nstill in its planning stages, will<br />\ndeal with the implications of the<br />\nHuman Life Amendment and<br />\nthe Family Protection Act.<br />\nIn the view of several of its<br />\norganizers, Tracy Stambaugh,<br />\nChris Campbell, and Philip<br />\nSchmandt, the PSU this semester<br />\nrepresents a better-organized<br />\ngroup. Rather than breaking up<br />\ninto various committees, each<br />\n<br />\nbiweekly business meetings' on<br />\nTuesday nights with educational<br />\nmeetings to be held on alternating weeks. At the educational<br />\nmeetings, each member of the<br />\nPSU will be asked to give a talk<br />\non a politically-related topic he<br />\nor she is interested in. According to Schmandt, this will<br />\nimprove the speaking abilities of<br />\nthe members and give the<br />\nlisteners a broader scope.<br />\nAccording to Campbell and<br />\nSchmandt, interest in the PSU<br />\nhas been increasing since the end<br />\nof last semester, and reorganization seems to have been a factor<br />\n<br />\nKathy Ogren and Neil Smith discuss future plans for PSU.<br />\nwith its own issue of concern, in this respect.

Since<br />\n1968, many more supplemental and enrichment courses have<br />\nbeen added to the program,<br />\nwith over seventy courses to be<br />\noffered during the 1982 Spring<br />\nSemester.

With the demise of the<br />\nPhiladelphia Bulletin today, the alarming<br />\ntrend of failing newspapers threatens to<br />\nbecome an unstoppable wave. Papers are<br />\nfolding everywhere, and not just across the<br />\nmiddle of the page. Why? Because, in<br />\naddition to all the complicated socioeconomic reasons, no one wants to take the<br />\ntime td sit down and read anymore. As<br />\nHodding Carter III, former White House<br />\nspokesman, said in a recent speech at<br />\nHopkins, the piblic wants a headline<br />\nserVice, and they are getting it from TV,<br />\nradio, and surviving publications.

Many of the<br />\ntexts used at Johns Hopkins are<br />\nhighly advanced rather than<br />\ngeneralized. Students like to<br />\nkeep these advanced books for<br />\nreference.<br />\nStudents who do want to<br />\nsell their textbooks can sell them<br />\nback to the book center. Barnes<br />\nand Noble will usually pay 50<br />\npercent of the cover price for<br />\ncurrent books. They will then<br />\ntry to sell the book at 75 percent of the cover price. Newton<br />\nsays that some students try to<br />\nsell books on their own, usually<br />\nat two-thirds of the list price,<br />\nbut most students do not find<br />\nthat the slight savings warrant<br />\nthe inconvenience of bypassing<br />\nthe campus bookstore.<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office is<br />\nconsidering organizing some sort<br />\nof book sale for next semester so<br />\nstudents can trade or sell those<br />\nbooks that they don't want to<br />\nkeep.<br />\n<br />\nattend the meeting, at which<br />\nformer participants in the program will be present to answer<br />\nquestions.<br />\nApplicants must<br />\napply by Tuesday, Feb. 16, for<br />\nthe academic year 1982-83.<br />\nAcceptances, which are determined primarily by the student's<br />\nacademic standing, will be announced by Feb. 23.<br />\n<br />\nThe Office of Undergraduate and Graduate Studies has<br />\nscheduled a meeting for students<br />\ninterested in spending a year<br />\nstudying at Hopkins' Bologna<br />\nCenter in Italy at 12 noon on<br />\nTuesday, Feb. 9, in Gilman<br />\n348.<br />\nThe program's courses primarily deal with international<br />\nstudies and European politics;<br />\nthis year, however, courses in<br />\nItalian culture are also being<br />\nname in its title.

The gap is, of course, largely<br />\nthe fault of the student himself, for either he does<br />\nnot know what he wants, or has chosen to pursue an<br />\ninterest that most people are unwilling to pay him<br />\nfor.

Dr. Holland is the foremost authority on<br />\ncareer guidance. Holland's test identifies a person's<br />\nstrengths and preferences in six areas: social, enterprising, conventional, realistic, artistic, and investigative. The results lead to a combination of a student's<br />\nthree greatest strengths out of the six groups. Under<br />\neach combination there is a list of careers which<br />\nmight suit his or 'her particular skills and aspirations.<br />\nFor instance, if you are an ESA you might want to<br />\nbecome a judge, lawyer, politician, stockbroker,<br />\nfashion coordinator, seller of photographic equipment, travel guide, flight attendant, or seller of<br />\nmusical instruments.<br />\nHolland's test is particularly helpful because it<br />\ncombines skills with one's desire to do a job. First<br />\none marks the activities one likes or dislikes, then one<br />\nmarks the occupations that one has an interest in or<br />\nthat seem a ppealing.Finally, the test instructs one to<br />\nrank one's own abilities as compared with persons of<br />\none's own age.<br />\nSupplementing Holland's test is a book of<br />\njobs, The Directory of Occupational Titles, which can<br />\nbe found in most libraries and employment and<br />\ncounseling offices, would feed your code combination into many occupations you may never have<br />\nconsidered, or even heard of! For instance, if you are<br />\nrealistic, artistic, and investigative you might be a<br />\ncompositor! (Curious about being a compositor? Call<br />\n338-7647 for more information.)<br />\nDeciding what you want to do is only part of<br />\nthe battle. Once you've picked a general focus,,then<br />\nit's time to pound the pavement. You've got to<br />\nconvince the profession that you've chosen to choose<br />\nyou<br />\n<br />\ndecide not to continue their education, or to delay summer jobs \u2014 go for the ones you've only dreamed<br />\nfurther education for different reasons.<br />\nof getting.

After the final approval<br />\nprocess, the bill will be introduced within the next few weeks<br />\nas an \"administration bill\" filed<br />\non behalf of the Governor by<br /><br />\nthe Speaker of the House and<br />\nthe President of the State<br />\nSenate.<br />\nThe attractiveness of the<br />\nnew proposal, as seen by Muller,<br />\nis that \"it would not cost state<br />\ntaxpayers a cent\"; the state<br />\nlegislature need only approve the<br />\ntax exempt status to permit the<br />\nfloating of the tax free bonds.<br />\nThe bonds would be backed<br />\nsolely by the institutions that<br />\nissue them. \"We would borrow<br />\nat a lower rate than if they were<br />\ntaxable bonds and then lend to<br />\nstudents at the lower rate,\"<br />\nMuller explained. Since the new<br />\nlow interest rate requires capital,<br />\nthe extra funds will in turn come<br />\nfrom the Student Aid Budget.<br />\nHowever, according to Director<br />\nof Financial Aid Susan Broadbent, a tremendous amount of<br />\nmoney would still have to be<br />\ninvested by Hopkins to make the<br />\nbonds more attractive to prospective investors.<br />\nWoodworth also added that<br />\npassage of the bill is now necessary, because \"Reaganomics has<br />\ndriven colleges to look for other<br />\nsources of support for their<br />\nstudents.\" If the bill is passed<br />\nduring this legislative session,<br />\nthe law will be enacted June 1.<br />\nWoodworth hopes that if bond<br />\nsales proceed, the resulting student money should become<br />\navailable at Hopkins as early as<br />\nJanuary 1983.<br />\nThe state of Illinois has<br /><br />\nalready passed legislation under<br />\na similar plan. However, one<br />\ndrawback of the Illinois program<br />\nis that only state residents can<br />\nreceive the loans. The Hopkins<br />\nbackers of the Maryland bill are<br />\nhoping to circumvent this obstacle since a large number of<br />\nHopkins loan recipients are from<br />\nout of state.<br />\nAlthough plans to implement the loan program are still<br />\ntentative,- Broadbent feels the<br />\nprogram will be run similar to<br />\nthe Guaranteed Student Loan<br />\nProgram. However, eligibility<br />\nwould most likely only extend<br />\nto students who are now disqualified from GSLs due to the new<br />\nincome limitations imposed by<br />\nCongress.<br />\nBroadbent<br />\ndescribes as<br />\n\"frightening\" the inability to<br />\npredict exactly how much Ellery Woodworth of the Office of Governmental Affairs hopes that<br />\nthe Maryland Assembly will pass legislation to help JHU finance<br />\ncon 't. on p.7<br />\nmore student loans.<br /><br />\n\"Pro-Choice Teach-In\"Starts<br />\nNew Organization At JHU<br />\nBY MARTIN CARLSON<br />\nDespite rumors of a possible<br />\npro-life protest, Planned Parenthood and the Maryland Students<br />\nFor Choice organized a calm<br />\npro-choice workshop from 1 to<br />\n3 p.m. last Friday in the Garrett<br />\nRoom of the Eisenhower Li-<br /><br />\nCUS Approves Measure To Restore<br />\nLetter Grades For Student Research<br />\nBY KARL MORITZ<br /><br />\nThe new rule was prompted<br />\nby the problems that arose when<br />\nCiting \"inability to enforce \\ the CUS decided independent<br />\nthe rule,\" the Committee on research should be pass/fail,<br />\nUndergraduate Studies has de- while keeping the letter grade<br />\ncided to change the grading lp system for independent study.<br />\nsystem for independent research Professors and students were<br />\nfrom mandatory pass/fail to that quick to realize that by giving<br />\nof the standard letter grades. the group of students doing the<br /><br />\nStudents doing independent research may now receive letter grades.<br /><br />\nresearch a name and organizing<br />\nit as a class, they could use the<br />\nletter grade system. When the<br />\nCUS realized the ease with<br />\nwhich the rule was being circumvented, they decided to change<br />\nthe grades back to the letter<br />\ntype.<br />\nWhy would students want<br />\nthe added pressure of working<br />\ntoward a letter grade? According to one student currently<br />\ninvolved in research, the letter<br />\ngrade provides more incentive to<br />\ndo one's best on a project, and it<br />\nis also a better reflection of the<br />\nkind of job a student has done.<br />\nFurthermore, since the University allows a student to take<br />\nonly one class pass/fail each<br />\nsemester, any student doing<br />\nresearch does not have the<br />\nchance to take another class<br />\npass/fail.<br />\n\"I think it's to the credit of<br />\nthe CUS that if they think a rule<br />\nis unenforcable, they change it,\"<br />\nsaid Martha Roseman, Director<br />\nof Advising and Counseling.<br /><br />\nbrary. The date marked the<br />\nninth anniversary of the Roe vs.<br />\nWade Supreme Court decision<br />\nwhich declared abortion as a<br />\nconstitutional right.<br />\nAfter outlining the two<br />\nmajor pro-life measures presently before Congress, Jeni Schofield of Students For Choice<br />\nstated a major objection to the<br />\nHelms and Hatch proposals: a<br />\ndefinition of life beginning at<br />\nfertilization would ban the IUD<br />\nand all forms of oral contraceptives which prevent implantation<br />\nof the embryo. Schofield also<br />\npointed out that national polls<br />\nshow a majority of Americans<br />\nopposed to attempts to outlaw<br />\nabortion in this country.<br />\nIlse Darling and Robin<br />\nSchavitz of Planned Parenthood<br />\nfollowed with a presentation on<br />\ntechniques of lobbying for prochoice. They suggested telegrams, personal letters and post-<br /><br />\ncards, phone calls, and petitions<br />\nas excellent means of lobbying a<br />\nlegislator. But if a person wants<br />\nto go to state or national<br />\nlegislatures, Darling said that he<br />\nor she must be \"reasonable\"<br />\nand know many of the facts<br />\nunderlying the abortion controversy. She added, \"We keep<br />\nmaking<br />\nthe<br />\nstress<br />\non<br />\nchoice...we're not 'pro-abortion,'<br />\nbut we want to allow women to<br />\nchoose.\"<br />\nTo illustrate their<br />\npoints about legislative lobbying,<br />\nDarling<br />\nand Schavitz placed<br />\nthemselves in the roles of<br />\nCongresswoman and lobbyist.<br />\nAfter the speeches, the<br />\norganizers divided the audience<br />\ninto smaller groups according to<br />\nschools\u2014Homewood, the Health<br />\nInstitutions, Towson State, and<br />\nUMBC.<br />\nIn the Homewood<br />\ncorner, students discussed the<br />\ndifficulties of forming a new<br />\ncon 't. on p.7<br /><br />\nRepresentatives from pm-choice groups address students.<br /><br />\nPAGE 2 / JANUARY 29, 1982<br /><br />\nPSU Outlines FocalPoints For Spring Semester<br />\nBY SUNITA HANJURA<br />\nUnder: an organizational<br />\nplan slightly different from last<br />\nsemesters.: the Hopkins Progressive Students Union (PSU) has<br />\noutlined i:ts focal points and<br />\nplanned a! debate as well as<br />\nseveral forums aimed at informing students about, and eliciting<br />\ndiscussion of. various issues.<br />\nchief among them being increased militarism and the effect<br /><br />\nof federal budget cuts on higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe PSU plans a debate<br />\nwith the Young Republicans on<br />\nthe former topic: for the latter,<br />\nthey have scheduled a forum, to<br />\nbe held February 24, on cuts in<br />\neducational benefits and their<br />\neffect on the student population. Present at the forum will<br />\nbe Susan Broadbent, Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid, Jan Fein of the<br />\nU.S. Student Association, and<br /><br />\nGreg Paul considers this year's PSU work.<br /><br />\nJoel Weisman of the University<br />\nof Massachusetts at Amherst.<br />\nAccording to Philip Schmandt of<br />\nthe PSU, Weisman will provide a<br />\n\"political analysis of Reagan's<br />\nattitude and strategy\" regarding<br />\nhigher education while Fein and<br />\nBroadbent will elucidate what<br />\nthe budget cuts are in general<br />\nand how they will affect<br />\nHopkins students.<br />\nAlso related to this theme,<br />\nthe PSU plans to send a group to<br />\nthe AFSCME march in Annapolis<br />\nto be held March 13. The<br />\nHopkins demonstrators will<br />\nmarch under the slogan \"Don't<br />\nReaganize Education,\" as part of<br />\nthe \"Solidarity\" theme of the<br />\ndemonstration: \"Don't Reaganize Maryland.\"<br />\nAlthough these two issues<br />\nare the primary points of focus<br />\nfor the PSU this semester, the<br />\ngroup, with an estimated membership of forty, will address<br />\nother political issues.<br />\nOn<br />\nFebruary 10th, the Union will<br />\nhold a forum dealing with the<br />\ncrisis in Poland featuring Solidarity member Eva Hauser, a Polish<br />\nactivist who left the country in<br />\n1971.<br />\nThe group also plans to take<br />\npart in the antiwar demonstration sponsored by the Committee in Solidarity with the people<br />\nof El Salvador. The demonstration, scheduled for March 27,<br />\nwill be held at Fort Bragg, where<br />\nSalvadorean soldiers are already<br />\nbeing trained for combat and<br />\nsent to El Salvador to fight.<br />\nIn addition, the PSU, in<br />\naffiliation<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\nJHU<br /><br />\nWomen's Center, is dealing with<br />\nissues concerning the rights of<br />\nwomen. Cindy Stagoff of the<br />\nPSU is currently organizing a<br />\nforum on how Reagan's budget<br />\ncuts affect women. The Forum.<br />\nstill in its planning stages, will<br />\ndeal with the implications of the<br />\nHuman Life Amendment and<br />\nthe Family Protection Act.<br />\nIn the view of several of its<br />\norganizers, Tracy Stambaugh,<br />\nChris Campbell, and Philip<br />\nSchmandt, the PSU this semester<br />\nrepresents a better-organized<br />\ngroup. Rather than breaking up<br />\ninto various committees, each<br /><br />\nbiweekly business meetings' on<br />\nTuesday nights with educational<br />\nmeetings to be held on alternating weeks. At the educational<br />\nmeetings, each member of the<br />\nPSU will be asked to give a talk<br />\non a politically-related topic he<br />\nor she is interested in. According to Schmandt, this will<br />\nimprove the speaking abilities of<br />\nthe members and give the<br />\nlisteners a broader scope.<br />\nAccording to Campbell and<br />\nSchmandt, interest in the PSU<br />\nhas been increasing since the end<br />\nof last semester, and reorganization seems to have been a factor<br /><br />\nKathy Ogren and Neil Smith discuss future plans for PSU.<br />\nwith its own issue of concern, in this respect. Says Schmandt:<br />\nthis semester the PSU is more \"We've been around for a<br />\ncohesive in that the group as a year now and I think people are<br />\nwhole will concentrate on two beginning to realize that we're<br />\nnot a layover from the '60s or<br />\nmain points.<br />\nThe members will hold some commie craze.\"<br /><br />\n\u2022i,a43cM=V3=3Ca3==a43cMCMaorao3ir2S<br />\ntcli<br />\nf;<br /><br />\nNOTICE<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\ntl JIGAMSA<br />\nJewish Interprofessional Graduate And<br />\nMedical Student Association<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\n4<br />\ng<br />\n#<br /><br />\ng<br />\nPRESENTS ITS FIRST<br />\nii<br /><br />\nrs<br /><br />\n\u00a71<br />\nrs<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\nCOFFEEHOUSE<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\nFEATURING MUSIC OF THE 60's&amp;70's BY<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\nSKYLINE DRIVE<br /><br />\n#<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\nSUNDAY, JANUARY 31<br />\n8:30 PM g<br />\nti THE RATHSKELLAR,JHU HOMEWOOD CAMPUS<br /><br />\n# REFRESHMENTS SERVED<br />\n$2.50 DONATION g<br />\ng for more information call 889-5783 / 889-5413<br />\ng<br />\ng<br />\ng<br /><br />\n#<br /><br />\n#<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\n=ctorrtor==or==aoracm3Xtoraor<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nThe American Association of University Students is a<br />\nconsortium of 7 major universities (Brown, Columbia,<br />\nCornell, nuke, Harvard, Penn, Tufts) which has recenty invited Johns Hopkins to become a member.

The<br />\nschool is a \"no-cost, noncredit, no-grades\" university<br />\nwithin the Hopkins framework.<br />\nThe Baltimore Free University<br />\nis affiliated with Hopkins<br />\nthrough the sponsorship of the<br />\nChaplain's Office, and is now<br />\ndirected by the Assistant to the<br />\nChaplain, Daniel J.

Since<br />\n1968, many more supplemental and enrichment courses have<br />\nbeen added to the program,<br />\nwith over seventy courses to be<br />\noffered during the 1982 Spring<br />\nSemester. An example of this<br />\nis the nuclear energy program.<br />\nThe Free U. instructors are<br />\nnot employed; they volunteer<br />\nto teach a subject and students<br />\nsign up for the classes on the<br />\nbasis of interest.

The fee helps to cover<br />\nthe costs of administrative<br />\nservices, brochure publication,<br />\nand advertising. The curricu-<br /><br />\nlum is comprised of practical,<br />\ncreative, and unusual courses,<br />\nprimarily skill-and-enrichment<br />\noriented. There is a wide<br />\nvariety of courses from which<br />\nto choose in the areas of<br />\n\"How-To,\" Sports, Fitness,<br />\nRecreation, Art, Music and<br />\nDance, Languages, Literature<br />\nand Writing, Issues and Discussion, and Self.<br />\nFeedback from the Free<br />\nUniversity participants is encouraged and received. The<br />\nquestionnaires<br />\nevaluating which are circulated among the<br />\nstudents reveal that most are<br />\nsatisfied with the course selection and instruction. Recommendations are made as to the<br />\ncontinuing needs of the community, classes students want<br />\nto see offered in future semesters, and scheduling problems. Everyone is welcomed<br />\nand admitted to the school, as<br />\nthe Free University promises<br />\n\"something for everyone.\"<br />\nThe atmosphere of this<br />\nsupplementary and complementary system of education is<br />\nopen and informal, with all<br />\ncourses presented free of<br />\ngrades, exams, credits, pressure<br />\nand cost.<br />\n\"This freedom<br />\npromotes the successful mutual<br />\ninterests. of the participants,\"<br />\ncomments Kurland.

Dr. Holland is the foremost authority on<br />\ncareer guidance. Holland's test identifies a person's<br />\nstrengths and preferences in six areas: social, enterprising, conventional, realistic, artistic, and investigative. The results lead to a combination of a student's<br />\nthree greatest strengths out of the six groups. Under<br />\neach combination there is a list of careers which<br />\nmight suit his or 'her particular skills and aspirations.<br />\nFor instance, if you are an ESA you might want to<br />\nbecome a judge, lawyer, politician, stockbroker,<br />\nfashion coordinator, seller of photographic equipment, travel guide, flight attendant, or seller of<br />\nmusical instruments.<br />\nHolland's test is particularly helpful because it<br />\ncombines skills with one's desire to do a job. First<br />\none marks the activities one likes or dislikes, then one<br />\nmarks the occupations that one has an interest in or<br />\nthat seem a ppealing.Finally, the test instructs one to<br />\nrank one's own abilities as compared with persons of<br />\none's own age.<br />\nSupplementing Holland's test is a book of<br />\njobs, The Directory of Occupational Titles, which can<br />\nbe found in most libraries and employment and<br />\ncounseling offices, would feed your code combination into many occupations you may never have<br />\nconsidered, or even heard of! For instance, if you are<br />\nrealistic, artistic, and investigative you might be a<br />\ncompositor! (Curious about being a compositor?

My role<br />\nmodel is Danny Zeitland, a jazz pianist<br />\nwho graduated from the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool several years ago.And of course, the fantasy of the<br />\nunofficial performer is a very personal<br />\none, which is why Lansman is not playing<br />\nthe part of keyboard wizard for some<br />\ngroup, even on a casual basis.<br />\n\"There's a good Bill Evans quote I<br />\nlike to think of in connection with that,he says. \"He said.

But now the jamming scene is<br />\nbone dry around here again.\"<br />\nLansman closes out a discussion<br />\nof his music with a pitch for jazz in<br />\ngeneral: \"I didn't listen to it until I was<br />\n20. and then only because a friend forced<br />\nme to.

After<br />\nlast night's game against Franklin and Marshall, the Jays sport a<br />\n7-8 record. However, they are a<br />\nperfect 6-0 in the friendly<br />\nconfines of the Newton II. White<br />\nAthletic Center. Coach Nappy<br />\nDoherty explained, \"It's much<br />\neasier to come from behind<br />\nwhen the crowd is behind you.\"<br />\nThe Jays are 7-5 in Division<br />\nIII play, having lost to Division I<br />\nTech ,<br />\npowerhouses Virginia<br />\nVirginia Commonwealth and<br />\nWake Forest.

Tom Tessitore was a<br />\nkey to the Blue Jay surge,<br />\nhitting for 12 first-half points.<br />\nThe second half was a tight<br />\nscoring battle, as neither team<br />\nmanaged a lead of more than 6<br />\npoints. With only a few minutes<br />\nleft, and Hopkins trailing 64-61,<br />\nLebanon Valley's two big men,<br />\nGoodwin and Malen, fouled<br />\nout. Nick Nikic took command<br />\nfor the Jays, scoring two field<br />\ngoals and hitting eight free<br />\nthrows. Nevertheless, Lebanon<br />\nValley fought back, tying the<br />\ngame at 73-73. With thirteen<br />\nseconds left, Hopkins inbounded<br />\nthe ball looking for Nikic, who<br />\nhad the hot hand. Nikic missed,<br />\nbut Tessitore got the rebound<br />\nand was fouled on the play.<br />\nWith three seconds on the clock,<br />\nhe calmly sank the two free<br />\nthrows, giving the Jays the<br />\nvictory. Nikic finished the game<br />\nwith 20 points, while Tessitore<br />\ntallied 16 points.<br />\nJust two days later, the Jays<br />\nwon another cliffhanger, defeating Cabrini 60-59. The Jays<br />\nplayed a g6od first half and led<br />\n33-29 at the intermission.<br />\nThe way the Jays started<br />\nthe second half, they should<br />\nhave stayed in the locker room.<br />\nPlaying poorly, the Jays fell<br />\nbehind 5848. However, once<br />\nagain, the full court press went<br />\nto work. With the crowd urging<br />\nthem on, the Jays rallied to take<br />\na 60-58 lead with three minutes<br />\nremaining. Neither team could<br />\ntake advantage of its one-andone opportunities.<br />\nWith only three seconds<br />\nremaining, and Hopkins leading<br />\n60-59, Cabrini had the ball.<br />\nCabrini's Ray Young was fouled<br />\nand he went to the line for a<br />\none-and-one. He missed the first<br />\nfree throw, but Cabrini's Jim<br />\nBaukal got the rebound and was<br />\nfouled on the play. Baukal went<br /><br />\nto the line for two shots and a<br />\nchance to win the game.
