Athletic scholarships are granted by many<br />\ncolleges with a good deal of hypocritical talk about Rhodes scholarships, high grades, fine character,<br />\neligibility, etc., but for the obvious<br />\npurpose of providing teams with<br />\npaid players to win games.\"<br />\nThe new plan provides for athletic<br />\nscholarship which the athletes are<br />\nawarded not for competition on representative teams, but for their assistance in teaching sports to other<br />\nstudents. The change in policy also<br />\nbrought the resignation of present<br />\ncoaches Valentine (Dutch) Lentz and<br />\nJohn C Donohue. Barr praised the<br />\ntwo coaches for their recent extensive development of intramural sports<br />\nwhich made it possible to complete<br />\nthe new plans.<br />\nBarr expressed the sentiment that<br />\nthe new plan would not decrease the<br />\ninterest in athletics. \"Fear may be<br />\nexpressed that dropping intercollegiate athletics will kill interest in all<br />\nathletics. This fear seems to be<br />\ngroundless. There are two kinds of<br />\ninterest in athletics, the interest a<br />\ngood player feels in playing well, and<br />\nthe interest a 'popular athlete' feels<br />\nin attracting applause. We want and<br />\nexpect at St John's a great deal of<br />\nthe first kind of interest but exhibitionism does not interest us.\"<br />\n<br />\nSlants on Thanksgiving .<br />\nBy OUR HOLIDAYS CORRESPONDENT<br />\nThis is a Thanksgiving feature.<br />\nThat's all that can be said for it.<br />\nThank God!<br />\nThanksgiving.<br />\nMost people go home for Thanksgiving.

But sometime between the<br />\nfirst one and the last one we passed<br />\nthe law of diminishing returns.<br />\nAt last after three hours of glut,<br />\nwe slumped from our chair to the<br />\nfloor and lay there immobile until<br />\nlong after dark. Then taking a chance<br />\nof moving ourselves without being<br />\nabsolutely convinced that our belly<br />\nwas coming along with us, we crawled<br />\nto the couch and there we spent the<br />\nnight amid ghoulish dreams.<br />\nWhen we say ghoulish, we mean it.<br />\nA swiss yodeler duet sung in company with three discordant banjoes<br />\nand an oboe.

Athletic scholarships are granted by many<br />\ncolleges with a good deal of hypocritical talk about Rhodes scholarships, high grades, fine character,<br />\neligibility, etc., but for the obvious<br />\npurpose of providing teams with<br />\npaid players to win games.\"<br />\nThe new plan provides for athletic<br />\nscholarship which the athletes are<br />\nawarded not for competition on representative teams, but for their assistance in teaching sports to other<br />\nstudents. The change in policy also<br />\nbrought the resignation of present<br />\ncoaches Valentine (Dutch) Lentz and<br />\nJohn C Donohue. Barr praised the<br />\ntwo coaches for their recent extensive development of intramural sports<br />\nwhich made it possible to complete<br />\nthe new plans.<br />\nBarr expressed the sentiment that<br />\nthe new plan would not decrease the<br />\ninterest in athletics. \"Fear may be<br />\nexpressed that dropping intercollegiate athletics will kill interest in all<br />\nathletics. This fear seems to be<br />\ngroundless. There are two kinds of<br />\ninterest in athletics, the interest a<br />\ngood player feels in playing well, and<br />\nthe interest a 'popular athlete' feels<br />\nin attracting applause.

Then taking a chance<br />\nof moving ourselves without being<br />\nabsolutely convinced that our belly<br />\nwas coming along with us, we crawled<br />\nto the couch and there we spent the<br />\nnight amid ghoulish dreams.<br />\nWhen we say ghoulish, we mean it.<br />\nA swiss yodeler duet sung in company with three discordant banjoes<br />\nand an oboe.
