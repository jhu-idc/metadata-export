But we do want to impress upon the stu- \u2022<br />\ndents the necessity of working hard at the business of selling<br />\ntickets. Hopkins teams may not be the leading college teams<br />\nof the country, but we are willing to ask the man who says that<br />\nHopkins lacrosse is poor to step outside. And it is for the<br />\nlacrosse season that the tickets are to be sold.

Now,<br />\nafter much work upon the part of those most interested, we<br />\nhave a capable swimming team, an excellent pool, and a fair<br />\nleague schedule, considering the short space of time in which<br />\nit was compiled. The Athletic Association is backing the meets<br />\nwhich are always followed by enjoyable dances in order to<br />\nmake the events more enticing. Yet with all this only a handful of spectators turned out at the first two meets with Rutgers<br />\nand Delaware, in both of which Hopkins showed up well.<br />\nThe Athletic Association has stobd the loss of money in<br />\nspite of its failing finances, but this does not make the outlook<br />\nbright for succeeding teams in the future.<br />\nBaseball has gone and it looks as though a similar fate<br />\nwill be tarked to the swimming team, unless it is supported<br />\nmuch more strongly at the remaining two meets.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER urges every man to attend the meet tonight not because we think he will enjoy himself and want to<br />\nadvertise the team, but because of interest in the future of<br />\nsports at Hopkins.<br />\nC.
