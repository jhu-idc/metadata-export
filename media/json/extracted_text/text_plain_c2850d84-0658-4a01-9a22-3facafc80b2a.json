They were<br />\nlikewise alarmed at the determination that<br />\nthe station would be professionally managed rather than student run, as it had been<br />\nsince its inception. Students, especially those<br />\npreviously active with the station, understandably became concerned and seriously question the decision of the administration to<br />\nreduce student input. Resolutions were<br />\nsubsequently proposed by Student Council<br />\nand several meetings were held between<br />\nstudents and administrators to advocate<br />\nsignificant student involvement when WJHU<br />\nresumed broadcasting activities.<br />\nRecently, another announcement was<br />\nissued by the Office of the Vice President for<br />\nCommunications and Publicity stating the<br />\nWJHU-FM would, in fact, return to the airwaves early this spring, broadcasting at its<br />\nprevious power of 10 watts. This seems an<br />\nencouraging<br />\ndevelopment,<br />\nsince<br />\nundergraduates now have the opportunity to<br />\ndemonstrate to the administration the<br />\nnecessity of extensive student participation<br />\nat the ramplic radio station. In addition,<br />\n<br />\nstudents may enjoy, at least briefly, the notion that the administration occasionally<br />\nlistens to their concerns.<br />\nIt may be a bit premature, however, to<br />\ncongratulate ourselves on our notable influence upon administrative decisions. It is<br />\nunlikely that student demands played more<br />\nthan a minimal role in the resurrection of<br />\nWJHU. Johns Hopkins has received<br />\nnumerous license extensions from the<br />\nFederal Communications Commission since<br />\nthe station has been off the air, the latest of<br />\nwhich coincidentally expires in February.<br />\nFurthermore, the undergraduates have yet<br />\nto receive any guarantee of continued meaningful student participation in the future,<br />\nwhen the station progresses to 25,000 watts.<br />\nWhat the administration has achieved is the<br />\nappeasement of senior staff members of the<br />\nstation, who will have graduated when the<br />\nnew station begins broadcasting.<br />\nthis is not to detract from the dedication<br />\nof individual students to maintain the integrity and character of WJHU as a student station. Our rather pessimistic view is based<br />\nupon past observation of administrationstudent interaction and we will reserve our<br />\napplause until next September.<br />\n<br />\nLet Young People Be Young<br />\nby Maxwell Glen and Cody<br />\nShearer<br />\nWASHINGTON\u2014Before<br />\nRonald Reagan had even<br />\nrenewed his oath of office,<br />\naides to Sen.

So many<br />\nparticulars.<br />\nWhen honest people such as<br />\nyourselves are faced with difficult questions, they seek<br />\nanswers. Sometimes the answer<br />\ncomes in the form of a deeper<br />\nquestion. If the current reality<br />\nin Baltimore brutalizes the<br />\npoor, why is a great university<br />\nsuch as Hopkins so heavily involved in the killing business?<br />\nYou can't eat a Cruise missile.<br />\nYou can't rest your head on a<br />\nTrident II. In fact the current<br />\nmadness tells us that we continue to make weapons that we<br />\ncannot use.

In 1977, the<br />\nTrustees voted to re-establish<br />\nthe School of Engineering. This<br />\nschool would bring, as Dr. M.<br />\nGordon Wolman, chairman of<br />\nDOGEE stated, \"increased<br />\nvisibility of engineering\" at<br />\nHopkins, and with it, a new<br />\nrecognition of the special needs<br />\nof engineering research and<br />\neducation.<br />\nThus, DOGEE was posed for<br />\na period of growth that would<br />\ngreatly enhance its programs. A<br />\ngood measure of this change is<br />\nthe fact that nearly half of<br />\nDOGEE's faculty joined the<br />\ndepartment since 1979. As Dr.<br />\nWolman is happy to point out,<br />\nthe new School of Engineering<br />\nnot only has helped make<br />\nengineering at Hopkins more<br />\nvisible, it has also made<br />\nDOGEE more visible.<br />\nOne may wonder how a<br />\ndepartment such as DOGEE,<br />\nwhich is among the most diversified departments of the<br />\nUniversity, manages to be so effective within the confines of a<br />\nsmall university.<br />\nPart of that strength, of<br />\ncourse, rests in the existence of<br />\nan outstanding faculty.

These four faculty members along with other<br />\nfaculty from DOGEE offer a<br />\nlarge number of courses which<br />\nare part of the core curriculum<br />\nfor undergraduates studying<br />\ncivil engineering. Civil<br />\nEngineering reciprocates in this<br />\nrelationship by having a strong<br />\nand growing research interest in<br />\ngeotechnical engineering\u2014an<br />\narea of strong interest to several<br />\nDOGEE researchers.<br />\nAnother cooperative relationship exists between<br />\nDOGEE and the Center for<br />\nMetropolitan Planning (Metro<br />\nCenter). Metro Center's<br />\nresearch interests cover all<br />\naspects of urban problems and<br />\ninternational and national<br />\nplanning. The Director of<br />\nMetro Center, Jack C.

An area of<br />\nresearch of interest to' several<br />\nprofessors is that of human<br />\ngeography, urban studies, and<br />\nspatial location. Recent studies<br />\nin this area include investigations of the impact of multinational corporations, the origins<br />\nof organized town planning in<br />\nthe United States, and the<br />\npolitical historical geography of<br />\npublic works (e.g. water and:<br />\n.<br />\nwastewater treatment plants)<br />\ndevelopment in nineteenth century Baltimore.<br />\nRelated to the general area of<br />\ngeography is the research<br />\nunderway in systems analysis<br />\nand economics for public decision making.

They were<br />\nlikewise alarmed at the determination that<br />\nthe station would be professionally managed rather than student run, as it had been<br />\nsince its inception. Students, especially those<br />\npreviously active with the station, understandably became concerned and seriously question the decision of the administration to<br />\nreduce student input. Resolutions were<br />\nsubsequently proposed by Student Council<br />\nand several meetings were held between<br />\nstudents and administrators to advocate<br />\nsignificant student involvement when WJHU<br />\nresumed broadcasting activities.<br />\nRecently, another announcement was<br />\nissued by the Office of the Vice President for<br />\nCommunications and Publicity stating the<br />\nWJHU-FM would, in fact, return to the airwaves early this spring, broadcasting at its<br />\nprevious power of 10 watts. This seems an<br />\nencouraging<br />\ndevelopment,<br />\nsince<br />\nundergraduates now have the opportunity to<br />\ndemonstrate to the administration the<br />\nnecessity of extensive student participation<br />\nat the ramplic radio station. In addition,<br /><br />\nstudents may enjoy, at least briefly, the notion that the administration occasionally<br />\nlistens to their concerns.<br />\nIt may be a bit premature, however, to<br />\ncongratulate ourselves on our notable influence upon administrative decisions. It is<br />\nunlikely that student demands played more<br />\nthan a minimal role in the resurrection of<br />\nWJHU. Johns Hopkins has received<br />\nnumerous license extensions from the<br />\nFederal Communications Commission since<br />\nthe station has been off the air, the latest of<br />\nwhich coincidentally expires in February.<br />\nFurthermore, the undergraduates have yet<br />\nto receive any guarantee of continued meaningful student participation in the future,<br />\nwhen the station progresses to 25,000 watts.<br />\nWhat the administration has achieved is the<br />\nappeasement of senior staff members of the<br />\nstation, who will have graduated when the<br />\nnew station begins broadcasting.<br />\nthis is not to detract from the dedication<br />\nof individual students to maintain the integrity and character of WJHU as a student station. Our rather pessimistic view is based<br />\nupon past observation of administrationstudent interaction and we will reserve our<br />\napplause until next September.<br /><br />\nLet Young People Be Young<br />\nby Maxwell Glen and Cody<br />\nShearer<br />\nWASHINGTON\u2014Before<br />\nRonald Reagan had even<br />\nrenewed his oath of office,<br />\naides to Sen.

Their goal was to<br />\nenhance these research efforts<br />\nand strengthen their programs<br />\nof study. These four departments, Geology, Oceanography,<br />\nEnvironmental<br />\nEngineering, and Geography,<br />\nas a result of this conscious effort to examine themselves and<br />\ntheir roles in the University,<br />\ndecided to form two new<br />\ndepartments. Geololgy and<br />\nOceanography were the core of<br />\nwhat became the Department<br />\nof Earth and Planetary<br />\nSciences.<br />\nEnvironmental<br />\nEngineering and Geography<br />\nbecame, not surprisingly, the<br />\nDepartment of Geography and<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering \u2014<br />\nor DOGEE for short.<br />\nThe story of engineering at<br />\nHopkins begins in 1912, when<br />\nthe Maryland State Legislature<br />\nset aside $600,000 for \"a school<br />\nor department of applied<br />\nadvanced<br />\nand<br />\nscience<br />\ntechnology.\" From this date,<br />\nengineering grew. The University awarded its first engineering Ph.D. in 1916 and in the<br />\nsame year began evening classes<br />\nfor engineering students.<br />\nEngineering at Hopkins<br />\nthrough the 1950's remained<br />\nstrong and even flourished. At<br />\nabout this time, however,<br />\nHopkins began to follow trends<br />\nwhich would lead to an<br />\nengineering that emphasized the<br />\nbasic sciences and mathematics,<br />\nsometimes at the expense of the<br />\n\"practical\" side of engineering.<br />\nIn 1966, after some depart-<br /><br />\nments had disbanded or merged, the School of Engineering<br />\nSciences and the Faculty of<br />\nPhilosophy joined to form the<br />\nnew faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nBetween 1966 and 1977,<br />\nwhen the G.W.C. Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering was<br />\nfounded, engineering at<br />\nHopkins existed but with greatly decreased emphasis. One of<br />\nthe strong departments that remianed \u2014 DOGEE \u2014 helped<br />\nbridge this period of decline.<br />\nWhat was needed, many felt,<br />\nwas a renewed commitment to<br />\nengineering. In 1977, the<br />\nTrustees voted to re-establish<br />\nthe School of Engineering. This<br />\nschool would bring, as Dr. M.<br />\nGordon Wolman, chairman of<br />\nDOGEE stated, \"increased<br />\nvisibility of engineering\" at<br />\nHopkins, and with it, a new<br />\nrecognition of the special needs<br />\nof engineering research and<br />\neducation.<br />\nThus, DOGEE was posed for<br />\na period of growth that would<br />\ngreatly enhance its programs. A<br />\ngood measure of this change is<br />\nthe fact that nearly half of<br />\nDOGEE's faculty joined the<br />\ndepartment since 1979. As Dr.<br />\nWolman is happy to point out,<br />\nthe new School of Engineering<br />\nnot only has helped make<br />\nengineering at Hopkins more<br />\nvisible, it has also made<br />\nDOGEE more visible.<br />\nOne may wonder how a<br />\ndepartment such as DOGEE,<br />\nwhich is among the most diversified departments of the<br />\nUniversity, manages to be so effective within the confines of a<br />\nsmall university.<br />\nPart of that strength, of<br />\ncourse, rests in the existence of<br />\nan outstanding faculty.

An area of<br />\nresearch of interest to' several<br />\nprofessors is that of human<br />\ngeography, urban studies, and<br />\nspatial location. Recent studies<br />\nin this area include investigations of the impact of multinational corporations, the origins<br />\nof organized town planning in<br />\nthe United States, and the<br />\npolitical historical geography of<br />\npublic works (e.g. water and:<br />\n.<br />\nwastewater treatment plants)<br />\ndevelopment in nineteenth century Baltimore.<br />\nRelated to the general area of<br />\ngeography is the research<br />\nunderway in systems analysis<br />\nand economics for public decision making.
