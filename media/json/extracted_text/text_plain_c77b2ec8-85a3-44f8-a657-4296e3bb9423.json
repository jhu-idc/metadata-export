The I, the<br />\nsubjective self.\" The unconscious<br />\n\"is most evident to us in two<br />\nplaces\u2014in dreams and in fantasies.\" These basic notions of<br />\nSwiss psychologist Jung and<br />\nAustrian psychoanalyst Sigmund<br />\nFreud are \"subject to a lot of<br />\ndebate,\" she said. \"Dreams are<br />\nmetaphorical statements,\" she<br />\ncontinued, transmitted in \"symbolic and metaphoric language.\"<br />\nA brief history of dreams<br />\nfollowed, and Campbell-Scott<br />\nremarked that although dreams<br />\nfigured prominently in the Old<br />\n<br />\nand New Testaments and in many<br />\npast societies, Americans are frequently skeptical about them.<br />\n\"You shouldn't be daydreaming\" is a common sentiment here,<br />\nshe said.<br />\nBut dream study can be<br />\nbeneficial, she stated, paraphrasing Jungian analyst James Hall's<br />\nview that \"by paying attention to<br />\nour dreams we can enlarge our<br />\nconsciousness\" and \"become<br />\naware of issues that have driven<br />\nus . . . as we become more aware<br />\nof our unconscious, we become<br />\nmore aware of choices.\" Jung,<br />\nshe said, held that \"aspects of<br />\nourselves that we are unaware of<br />\nare in our unconsciousness and<br />\nmanifest themselves in dreams.\"<br />\nShe added that dreams might contain elements of a dreamer's<br />\nindividuation, the process<br />\nwhereby one develops a sense of<br />\nidentity.<br />\nA practical method to study<br />\ndreams, Campbell-Scott said, is<br />\nto pay close attention to, and to<br />\nquestion extensively the details of<br />\nthe dream. \"Put a notebook by<br />\n<br />\nyour bed to write it down,\" she<br />\nsaid of a hypothetical dream, and<br />\n\"tell yourself before you sleep to<br />\ndo it . . . once you have the<br />\ndream itself, what is the setting?\"<br />\nAlso important is \"the dream ego<br />\n. . . the I in the dream . . . the<br />\npart that is most like your conscious ego.\" One should<br />\nscrutinize, she continued, the<br />\nissues, conflicts, and people surrounding the dream ego.<br />\nShe stressed that other objects,<br />\nsuch as a house, a method of<br />\ntransportation, or animals in the<br />\ndream could also be important.<br />\n\"All of those tell you something<br />\nabout yourself.\" One should Ask<br />\n\"what are the feelings [you]<br />\nassociate with it\" and \"what does<br />\nit mean to [you]?\"<br />\nAlso, one could \"ask what are<br />\n[your] associations in the dream<br />\nto what happened in the day,\" or<br />\ndetermine \"your own association<br />\nto each element of the dream.\"<br />\nCampbell-Scott said that some<br />\ndreams feature characters from a<br />\ndreamer's past, a character the<br />\nscarcely<br />\nmight<br />\ndreamer<br />\n<br />\nremember. This person, of the<br />\nsame sex as the dreamer, was<br />\ncalled a \"shadow figure\" by<br />\nJung. The figure might represent<br />\n\"a rejected part of yourself' and<br />\ncan be \"a way of getting in touch<br />\nwith some rejected aspect of<br />\nyourself.\"<br />\nOne might talk to a shadow<br />\nfigure, or another mysterious<br />\ndream character, to learn more<br />\nabout it, Campbell-Scott noted.<br />\nThe dreamer could try, during the<br />\ndream, \"asking the question and<br />\nthen letting the answer be<br />\nwhatever it is . . . if it gets scary<br />\n. . . then stop it. You don't have<br />\nto keep going. You are not under<br />\na very powerful spell.\"<br />\nThough some forget their<br />\ndreams, Campbell-Scott said<br />\n'<br />\n\"you can discipline yourself\"<br />\nthrough practice and effort to<br />\nenhance dream retention.<br />\nOne \"can learn a great deal inside and out of therapy,\" by<br />\nstudying dreams, she said. \"I<br />\nthink it enriches our lives.\"<br />\n<br />\nBSN<br />\nSTUDENTS.<br />\n<br />\nIN<br />\n<br />\nEnter the Air Force<br />\nimmediately after graduation \u2014 without waiting for the<br />\nresults of your State Boards.

This often leads to<br />\nfeelings of frustration or a need<br />\nto escape to a fantasy environment because the person is<br />\nmisdirecting his feelings. The<br />\ntraditional role of women called<br />\nfor non-assertive behavior:<br />\nwomen were taught to be polite<br />\nand kind even when they did not<br />\nwant to.<br />\nThe consequences of nonassertive behavior can be serious.<br />\nThe most common result is<br />\ndepression. Feelings of low selfesteem or self-worth can also<br />\ndevelop as a result of nonassertiveness. Boswell explained<br />\nthat studies have been done which<br />\nshow that people who display<br />\nnon-assertive behavior often fail<br />\nto achieve personal goals or build<br />\nsuccessful relationships<br />\nA second type of behavior<br />\nDean Boswell identified was aggressive behavior. Aggressive<br />\nbehavior is defined as behavior<br />\nused by an individual to achieve<br />\nsomething which denies others<br />\n<br />\ntheir personal rights. Aggressive<br />\nbehavior includes a tone of voice<br />\nwhich may be loud or cold, a stiff<br />\nor uncomfortable stance, and<br />\ntense or hostile facial expressions.<br />\n<br />\nSometimes people who are inwardly insecure use aggression to<br />\ndivert attention from themselves.<br />\nOther explanations for aggressive<br />\nbehavior include childhood experiences, previous success or a<br />\nfear of loss of power. Aggressive<br />\nbehavior is expressed verbally<br />\nthrough the use of \"loaded\"<br />\nwords, which are words that can<br />\nhave multiple meanings. It can<br />\nalso be displayed through the use<br />\nof sarcasm or insults.<br />\n<br />\nBoswell discussed was assertive<br />\nbehavior. She defined it as<br />\n\"behavior which allows a person<br />\nto act in his or her own interest<br />\nwithout denying the rights of<br />\nothers.\" Assertive behavior is<br />\nphysically displayed with a relaxed, confident posture and facial<br />\nexpressions which are congruent<br />\nto what is being said.<br />\n<br />\nA person who is assertive is<br />\nable to freely express his own<br />\nneeds to others. This is a result<br />\nof a positive self-image and good<br />\nself-esteem. An assertive person<br />\nis able to achieve personal goals<br />\nbut by using negotiation and compromise rather than threats and<br />\nbullying. Additionally, an asserperson is respected by his or<br />\ntive<br />\nA person who is constantly agand is able to build solid<br />\npeers<br />\nher<br />\ngressive creates stress for himself<br />\nrelationships.<br />\ninterpersonal<br />\nor herself which could stimulate<br />\nfurther aggression and unhapThe secret to becoming an<br />\npiness. According to Boswell,<br />\nagressive behavior is essentially assertive person, according to<br />\nself-destructive because one is Boswell, is to use your mind. An<br />\ndoing damage to himself and his assertive person approaches problems rationally, not emotionalenvironment.<br />\nly. As a result, he or she has the<br />\nThe third type of behavior self-assuredness to listen to others<br />\n<br />\nand formulate an opinion which<br />\nwill truly reflect the way he or she<br />\nfeels. Dean Boswell suggested<br />\nthat one should start out by asking a simple question: \"Are you<br />\ngetting what you want?\" If the<br />\nanswer is no, then one should<br />\nrationally think about what the<br />\nproblem is and how to approach<br />\nit.<br />\nBoswell concluded her lecture<br />\nwith a list of myths about<br />\nbehavior. The first myth is that<br />\nassertive behavior is destructive<br />\nand wasteful. The second myth is<br />\nthat if one states how one truly<br />\nfeels about a relationship, the<br />\nother person will not be able to<br />\nhandle it. Boswell said one shold<br />\nnot feel responsible for the way<br />\nothers react.<br />\nby<br />\nBoswell concluded<br />\nenumerating a few essential rights<br />\nthat everyone has: the right to be<br />\nthe ultimate judge of one's self,<br />\nthe right not to justify one's<br />\nbehavior, the right to change<br />\none's mind, and the right to make<br />\nmistakes and take responsibility<br />\nfor those mistakes.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council resumes Rotunda Shuttle<br />\nCOUNCIL, from 2<br />\ncouraged attendance of the class'<br />\nopen meeting next Wednesday at<br />\n6:00 in the SAC Lounge and has<br />\narranged tickets for \"Les<br />\nMiserables\" to be sold for $16.00<br />\nstarting Monday.<br />\nIn open discussion, Junior<br />\nClass Representative Munia<br />\nMitra commented that the Student<br />\nHealth Advisory Committee<br />\n<br />\nneeds interested students to help while the School of Continuing<br />\nprovide the student body with bet- Studies will still provide some<br />\nter information concerning the courses in the evening.

McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: the<br />\npostman cometh . . .<br />\nToday I pull yet another letter<br />\nfrom the bulging bag of fan mail<br />\nthat I receive every week from<br />\nyou readers at home. This week's<br />\npostal tidbit comes from Nelson<br />\nFinefare, an imaginary Biology<br />\nmajor, who asks:<br />\n\"Dear Chris: Every week you<br />\nreceive a bulging bag of fan mail<br />\nfrom your readers at home, but<br />\nyou never respond to any of it in<br />\nyour column because you're too<br />\nbusy using it to misrepresent your<br />\nfriends. Wouldn't it be more efficient to just write us back, via<br />\nthe good old U.S. Postal<br />\nService?\"<br />\nThe fact of the matter is that<br />\nI'm afraid to use the mail ysstem.<br />\nMy explanation begins with two<br />\nelements: my obsessivecompulsive behavior, and the<br />\ntoaster oven that my brother<br />\nbought me last year for Christmas<br />\n(which I still haven't opened).<br />\nPerhaps this explanation will be<br />\nof use to those of you who, for<br />\nwhatever reason, don't get<br />\naround to writing people you<br />\nknow.<br />\nI have a friend who lives in<br />\nFlorida with a toaster oven just<br />\nlike the one I just mentioned. We<br />\nare very close, at least as close<br />\nas two people who see each other<br />\nat most one week out of each year<br />\ncan be.<br />\nI submit (and I don't think my<br />\neditors will disagree with me<br />\nhere) that were I to begin writing<br />\nto her, my letters would be<br />\nsimilarly long-winded. But it<br />\nwould take too long for me to<br />\nfinish each letter, and the guilt<br />\nwould build up, along with an<br />\nobsessive-compulsive urge to<br />\nend letter after letter. So,I would<br />\n'probably end up sending a page<br />\nof a letter every day.<br />\nI think it's safe to assume that<br />\nanyone would get annoyed trying<br />\nto read a letter a page at a time,<br />\nso she would collect my letters in<br />\na brown bag in her kitchen, promising herself that she'd open<br />\nthem all up one day and read<br />\nthem, while each night she'd just<br />\nrationalize a different reason as<br />\n<br />\nto why she hadn't opened them.<br />\nOne night she'll say it's<br />\nbecause she's in a hurry to get to<br />\naerobics class.

The<br />\npapers delivered to the Homewood campus this week contain condoms, not as some stunt done for shock value or<br />\na good laugh, but rather to stress the importance of education and responsibility in practicing safe sex.<br />\nTwo years ago, when the News-Letter first delivered<br />\ncondoms with its Valentine's Day issue, most Americans<br />\ncould not say the word \"condom\" in mixed company<br />\nwithout people raising their eyebrows or laughing nervously. Since then, education has been instrumental in not only lowering the condom's mystery and embarrassing<br />\nreputation, but also in teaching people about<br />\nthe benefits of using condoms.<br />\nThe condom is not just a means of contraception. Using a condom correctly can protect both you and your partner from the spread of many sexually transmitted diseases.<br />\nThe Health Center suggests the following simple steps to<br />\nsafe sex with a condom: 1) Ensure before use that the condom's package is sealed, and that it has been stored in a<br />\ncool, dry place. If you are unsure of how long it's been<br />\nsulking around your apartment, don't use it. 2) While putting on the condom (which can be an intimate part of<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nforeplay and not just an embarrassing pause in the middle<br />\nof things), make sure there is space in the tip to act as a<br />\nreservoir and then roll it all the way on to the penis. 3)<br />\nUse lubricants that are water-soluble and contain a spermicide such as Nonoxyl 9. 4) After climax, remove the<br />\nerect penis before it relaxes in the vagina. Hold the condom at its base and be careful not to tear it as you slowly<br />\nwithdraw. 5) Another important step in using a condom<br />\nis discussing the decision to use one with your partner.<br />\nOpening the channels of communication can improve an<br />\nalready intimate relationship. It is important to remember<br />\nthat just because a man wears the condom, the choices and<br />\nresponsibilies involved are not his alone, but those of his<br />\npartner as well.<br />\nIn providing you with condoms, the News-Letter is not<br />\ninviting you to drape them from trees, inflate them in class,<br />\nor scatter them all over Gilman. What we do hope is that<br />\nyou will deal with them responsibly, even if this means<br />\nthrowing them, unopened, into the nearest trash bin.<br />\nAdditional information on condoms and safe sex is<br />\navailable at the Health Center. Condoms are available there<br />\nfor a dollar a dozen. The Union Desk also has a wide selection, in a variety of shapes, colors and styles, available<br />\nfor your perusal.<br />\n<br />\nThe right to write<br />\nIt has been suggested that a Hopkins publication might<br />\nbe in jeopardy of losing its funding, as well as SAC<br />\nrecognition, were it to publish something which the majority of the SAC board found distasteful or inappropriate.<br />\nSuch an intrusive move on the part of the SAC would not<br />\nbe a good idea.<br />\nWhen editors are presented with material which may be<br />\noffensive to certain groups or individuals on campus, they<br />\nmust be allowed to make the decision as to whether or not<br />\nthe material is fit for publication. To mandate \"tolerance,\"<br />\nby setting strict guidelines as to what the SAC or the<br />\nUniversity finds offensive, is to render such a decision<br />\nmeaningless. As it has been said before, one cannot<br />\nlegislate morality.<br />\nStudent government, or the University administration,<br />\nmust be clearly separated from student publications. For<br />\na publication to be meaningful, its editors must have a certain level of responsibility for its contents. An editor must<br />\nhave the right and responsibility to edit staff work (letters<br />\n<br />\nto the editor are another issue). If a reader doesn't like<br />\na certain journal's bias or choice of material, he or she<br />\nshould be able to choose another or even begin his or her<br />\nown publication, with the SAC's blessing and funding.<br />\nProliferating campus publications would yield a wider<br />\nrange of ideas and forums, the aggregate result being a<br />\nbetter representation of campus awareness through a variety of editorial boards. The SAC, as an arm of the student<br />\ngovernment, must stay out of this entire process, aside<br />\nfrom acting as a facilitator. If the SAC,or the Administration, were to set artificial publication content guidelines,<br />\nthey might well be guilty of censorship.<br />\nWe suggest that the SAC invest in a desktop publishing<br />\nsystem, complete with a set of terminals, software and a<br />\nlaser printer,which would be available to any group which<br />\nwanted to publish. The consequential growth in the campus press would both invigorate campus intellectual life,<br />\nand remove the pressure from existing publications to be<br />\nall things to all people.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nHomewood II<br />\nHomewood I<br />\nThe following letter was<br />\ndistributed to the Homewood<br />\ncommunity this past week.<br />\n<br />\nTo All Members of the<br />\nHomewood Community:<br />\nThe cartoon published in the<br />\nHopkins Spectator, Volume 2,<br />\nIssue Number 3, is of concern.<br />\nIt is this sort of publication that<br />\nhelps create and promote an environment accepting sexism.

It has<br />\nlong been tradition that universities allow students to use their<br />\nown discretion in deciding what<br />\nis proper for print and what is inappropriate. If the students feel<br />\nthat what they are reading is offensive, they should react responsibly and with maturity, not by<br />\nrunning to the nearest university<br />\nofficial.

You might have concluded that James Rosen had drawn<br />\nsome kind of \"racist...ignorant'<br />\ncartoon about the Snack Bar staff<br />\nhere at Hopkins.<br />\nIf you read all five of the letters<br />\nthat conspired to generate this<br />\nconclusion, you may then consider yourself acquainted with a<br />\nstandard hypocrisy and disdain<br />\nfor you, the reader, that you probably will never again encounter<br />\nwith printed material.<br />\nLetters to the editor are usually persuasive efforts, and these<br />\nwere no different save for one<br />\naspect. You were told that you<br />\nwould certainly agree with these<br />\npeople if you were allowed to see<br />\nRosen's drawing, but that you<br />\nshould not see the strip in the first<br />\nplace, because it might upset you.<br />\nThese were thus the first letters<br />\nto the editor I've ever read whose<br />\nauthors sought to deny you the information that would most win<br />\nyou to their sides.<br />\nYou were also led to believe<br />\nthat the undeniability of this conclusion, that I draw racist cartoons, stems from the diversity of<br />\nbackground in those who felt<br />\nequipped to comment on it. Five<br />\npeople who somehow had more<br />\nright than you to see this cartoon...as well as five attendants<br />\nof the same meeting of a single<br />\nstudent group, which looks about<br />\n<br />\nas impartial as five Klansmen<br />\ntestifying together.<br />\nIt would seem to me, then, that<br />\nany such persuasive efforts would<br />\nbe consigned to failure ifjust one<br />\nperson, after finishing the fifth<br />\nletter, thought to him or herself:<br />\n\"Well, what did the comic strip<br />\nactually SAY?\" What could these<br />\nletter writers respond to you\u2014<br />\n\"Uh, trust us on this one, really.\" It's like asking a jury to<br />\nbelieve that a photograph shows<br />\nthe murder in action, without<br />\nshowing the jury the photograph.<br />\nThe reason for not printing the<br />\ncartoon is, simply, that my<br />\ndetractors are afraid of what you<br />\nmight do if you saw this cartoon.<br />\nCarlos Pezua, who complained<br />\nabout two comic strips in one<br />\nweek, claimed that my drawing<br />\nwould prompt from you \"a tirade<br />\nof racial outbursts.\" Throughout<br />\nthis sorry episode, I have never<br />\nwavered in my trust of your ability to read and think for<br />\nyourselves, like some have, nor<br />\nhave I ever believed, as some,<br />\nthat a cartoon would lead you to<br />\nviolent behavior.<br />\nPersonally I find the idea of<br />\ntrying to debate the merits of a<br />\nconcealed picture kind of...insipid...and so I will not demean<br />\nyou, as some have, by asking you<br />\nto believe anything at all about the<br />\nstrip until you've seen it for<br />\nyourself.<br />\nAs for my detractors' logic,<br />\nthat is there for all to see. Mr.<br />\nPezua wrote, \"The problem with<br />\nthis comic strip is that it harshly<br />\nadresses a sensitive issue.\" I<br />\nwould characterize Do The Right<br />\nThing in the same way.<br />\nGeorge Lerner told you I<br />\nbordered n Fascism while asking<br />\nyou to convict me on unseen<br />\nevidence\u2014much like a show trial<br />\nin a...Fascist...country. \"Look,<br />\nwe got five people to say it!\" Mr.<br />\nLerner also lamented to you the<br />\nSee LETTERS, 6<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nDouglas Munro<br />\n<br />\nSpeaker's Comer<br />\n<br />\nRebecca Garron<br />\nIt is about time that the Hopkins<br />\nCommunity\u2014male, female,<br />\nBlack, White, Gentile or Jew,<br />\nfaculty or student\u2014recognized<br />\nthe pervasive institutionalization<br />\nof sexism, racism, and exclusivism. It is also time for<br />\nspecial interests groups to<br />\nreevaluate their criticisms of Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel's cartoon, which I<br />\nwould like to defend from<br />\nimpassioned<br />\nmisdirected,<br />\ncriticism.<br />\nI am a member, in no prioritized order, of the female, white,<br />\nand Jewish Hopkins communities, and am painfully aware<br />\nof the prejudices directed at the<br />\nmembership of at least two of<br />\nthese. I am also aware that<br />\n\"special interest\" groups, being<br />\nhuman, are fallible, and, when<br />\nvictimized, can rashly critize<br />\nwithout fully understanding the<br />\ncomplexities of an issue.<br />\nMr. Podurgiel's cartoon,<br />\nthough lacking intellectual skill<br />\n(i.e. it is impossible to decipher<br />\nhis postion), is not necessarily<br />\nsexist. His cartoon rendered,<br />\nthrough a not-so-comic comic<br />\nmedium, a conversation to which<br />\nevery male and female at Hopkins<br />\nhas been subjected; that is the<br />\nbelief first, that women at<br />\nHopkins are physically unattractive, and second, the real sexism,<br />\nthat in fact the only way in which<br />\nto acknowledge women is as sexual entities. (It might be interesting to note that the cartoon<br />\nfurther implies that Hopkins men<br />\nare incapable of any kind of relationship sans alchohol). His cartoon does not necessarily agree<br />\nwith those beliefs, nor does it<br />\nnecessarily suggest that Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel espouses those beliefs.<br />\nThe cartoon is perhaps a means<br />\nby which to publicize the existence of those beliefs, and obviously, it did so successfully.<br />\nThis is an important distinction.<br />\nI can not speak for Mr.<br />\nPoduirgal's sensibilities; I can<br />\nonly hope to draw attention to the<br />\nGOOD MORNING,<br />\nROOF. P PENNY<br />\nFOR YOUR<br />\n-rmooGHTS<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\ntn<br />\n<br />\ncartoon so that we can all ask<br />\nwhat it means and in what ways<br />\nit is productive to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. I do hold Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel responsible for his<br />\nwords. Having explicitly invited<br />\ncriticism, it is now his obligation<br />\nto respond to those criticisms.<br />\nMr. Podurgiel?<br />\nBoth the victimized and the victimizers are members of the<br />\nHopkins community. We all have<br />\nresponsibilities to that community, and there are productive ways<br />\nof confronting divisive issues.<br />\n1. Censorship is not the<br />\nanswer. Women's groups in particular have called for the suppression of sexist material. Censorship only creates a violently<br />\npressurized silence beneath which<br />\nbreeds prejudice and misconceptions, both of which, given time,<br />\nwill explode in our faces. A more<br />\nproductive way of confronting<br />\nand eradicating prejudice is to<br />\npublicly engage those who nurture such prejudice. Either<br />\nboycott those publications which<br />\nencourage ignorance or use those<br />\npublications as a vehicle of<br />\ndebate. The responsibility is not<br />\nto denounce, but to inform.<br />\n2. Obviously, it is not only the<br />\nvictimized who are responsible<br />\nfor eradicating the ignorance<br />\nunderlying<br />\ndestructive<br />\nmisconceptions. Publications, the<br />\nadministration, and special interest groups alike are responsible for providing a forum in<br />\nwhich all can engage in healthy<br />\ndiscourse. The most blameworthy in this entire situation is not<br />\nMr. Podurgiel, nor individual<br />\nsexists (though they contribute to<br />\nthe problem), nor any one special<br />\ninterest group. It is The Spectator, a publication which does<br />\nnot even pretend to have an agenda and which chooses to attack<br />\nthe personal qualities of individuals, rather than discuss<br />\nissues in any depth. If asked. I am<br />\nboth happy and prepared to provide examples of The Spectator's<br />\n<br />\nDO YOU 864,e-YE<br />\nIN LovE?<br />\n<br />\ninept journalism. If not asked, I<br />\nwill assume that The Spectator is<br />\nnot only incompetent but<br />\napathetic, that they are aware of<br />\nhow irresposible and shallow is<br />\ntheir publication, and that by their<br />\nsilence they consent to agreement. Our responsibility then is<br />\nto demand that SAC pull its funding from The Spectator or that<br />\nit financially aid a competing and<br />\nresponsible publication.<br />\n3. No group on campus is solely responsible to itself; women's<br />\ngroups (i.e. the Women's Center)<br />\nshould publicly denounce not<br />\nonly sexism, but racism, financial<br />\nirresponsibility, etc. Jewish<br />\ngroups (i.e. JSA), Black groups<br />\n(i.e. BSU), and all special interest<br />\ngroups are obligated to speak out<br />\non issues that divide the community, regardless of whether or<br />\nnot they are the most visible and<br />\nimmediate victims. Every student<br />\nshould demand administrative<br />\nresponsibility: they've admitted<br />\nfemale bodies; it's time they've<br />\nadmitted female intellect.<br />\nEveryone should seek to eradicate<br />\nthose organizations which encourage exclusivism.

In<br />\nlast week's News-Letter there<br />\nwere six letters referring to a<br />\nJames Rosen cartoon which I<br />\ndon't remember seeing published. It turned out that my memory<br />\nhadn't failed me\u2014the cartoon had<br />\nbeen suppressed and five of the<br />\nletters were messages of congratulation to the editors for a job<br />\nwell done. It turned out that the<br />\nfive letter writers saw the cartoon<br />\nin a meeting of the Black Student<br />\nUnion. It also turned out that the<br />\nNews-Letter has a circulation of<br />\nsix-thousand. After some simple<br />\nsubtraction I realized that not too<br />\nmany people are going to be able<br />\nto contextualize the remarks of<br />\nRosens's critics, cogent though<br />\nthey may be.<br />\nThen my memory began working overtime, and I recalled an<br />\nunpleasant incident this summer,<br />\nwhich was reported in the<br />\nnewspapers and on television, so<br />\nmany News-Letter readers might<br />\nrecall it as well. Robert Mapplethorpe, a photographer of<br />\nsome renown and now deceased,<br />\nwas to have his work exhibited at<br />\nthe Concoran Gallery in<br />\nWashington D.C. The exhibit<br />\n<br />\nwas to be sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts,<br />\nuntil Senator Jesse Helms protested due to the homoerotic<br />\nnature of some of the<br />\nphotographs. NEA funding was<br />\nrevoked and the exhibit was moved to a smaller gallery amid controversy and debate. Newspaper<br />\nand television standards are such<br />\nthat none of the photographs in<br />\nquestion could appear for the<br />\npublic on whose behalf,<br />\npresumably, the debate began.<br />\nMany students who are pleased to<br />\nsee James Rosen's cartoon<br />\nrailroaded out of existence were<br />\nprobably outraged at the attempt<br />\nto supress Mapplethorpe's work.<br />\nMany of the arguments against<br />\nthe publicaton of the cartoon,<br />\nspecifically those forwarded by<br />\nGeorge Lerner, Makeba Lindsay,<br />\nand Craig Freeman mirror those<br />\nof Senator Helms in opposition to<br />\nthe Mapplethorpe exhibit.<br />\nIt is arrogant of the News-Letter<br />\neditors to presume to moderate a<br />\ndebate which their own restrictive<br />\neditorial policies have considered<br />\nmoot. (It is perhaps this same arrogance which compelled the<br />\nNews-Letter. to run an editorial<br />\nabout its editorial policies over<br />\nthe editorial on our new president.) If this debate is to continue<br />\nthe cartoon must be published.<br />\nNewspapers, like government,<br />\nserve a public need. When they<br />\ntry to dictate public need to serve<br />\nthemselves their function<br />\ndeteriorates into self-abuse.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, is it sexist to think a<br />\nwoman homely? Or must one's<br />\nconcept of beauty also be radically democratic making all<br />\nbeautiful as to not offend anyone?<br />\n<br />\nDavid Cohen<br />\n<br />\nCartoon IV<br />\n<br />\nAdam Mazmanian<br />\n<br />\nEditors'note: We can only repeat<br />\nthat Mr. Rosen was a member of<br />\nour staff, and therefore subject to<br />\nediting. We would oppose any attempt to penalize a publication<br />\nwhich decided to run his strip,<br />\nalthough wefeel under no obligation to do so ourselves.<br />\n<br />\nCartoon III<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI must take issue with some of<br />\nthe opinions raised in last week's<br />\nissue of the News-Letter. George<br />\nLerner says that \"the idea<br />\nborders on Fascism\" that James<br />\nRosen should be allowed to print<br />\nwhatever he wants. Although<br />\ncommon sense should be sufficient to discover the moronic<br />\nreasoning behind such a conclusion, maybe a more complete<br />\ncriticism is required. Fascism<br />\nproperly defined is a form of<br />\ngovernment that unites business<br />\nand state leadership with a<br />\nbelligerent nationalism. The most<br />\n\"successful\" form of fascism is<br />\ntotalitarianism which is a society<br />\nbased on extreme unity and<br />\nauthoritarianism, usually some<br />\nform of dictatorship. Totalitarian<br />\nregimes make much use of propaganda, a word which originates<br />\nfrom the Catholic counterreformation and the Holy Office<br />\nfor the Propagation of the Faith.<br />\nCensorship is an authoritarian<br />\nconcept as is coercive propagation of faith (whatever that faith<br />\nmay be\u2014for example religion and<br />\nradical democracy.)<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nMcCarthyist-type<br />\ndemagoguery in the name of<br />\nwiping out sexism, racism, antisemitism and homophobism is a<br />\ngrowing problem at Hopkins.<br />\nThe News-Letter's decision to<br />\njoin with the Women's Center in<br />\nsupporting the censorship of the<br />\n\"2x +1\" strip is particularly<br />\ndisturbing.<br />\nI didn't expect anything more<br />\nfrom the Women's Center.<br />\nFeminists at Hopkins have traditionally thrived on finding<br />\nsomething with sexual overtones<br />\nand changing it into the most<br />\nhorrible piece ever written. This<br />\nis precisely the strategy used by<br />\nJoe McCarthy in his battle against<br />\nCommunism. In the past, The<br />\nWomen's Center has even<br />\nresorted to opening other people's<br />\nmail, as Mr. Ellis so eloquently<br />\npoints out. This is a federal offense, but nothing new to Joe<br />\nMcCarthy and his disciples.<br />\nThe Women's Center should<br />\nalso keep in mind that they don't<br />\nspeak for all the women at J.H.U.<br />\nMost females I have talked with<br />\nhave no problem with the comic<br />\nstrip; some even found it funny.<br />\nAs for the News-Letter's reaction, I am stunned. McCarthyistlike fringe groups will always<br />\nexist, but it is only when<br />\nnewspapers and other media<br />\noutlets join the witch hunt that<br />\nthings start getting dangerous. In<br />\nlast week's editorial, the NewsLetter asserts \"sexism and racism<br />\nhave no place on our campus.\"<br />\nWho judges what is sexist or<br />\nracist and what is not? The NewsLetter! In the 2x +1 controversy,<br />\nthe News-Letter views sexism in<br />\nvery encompassing terms. Where<br />\ndoes the News-Letter draw the<br />\nline? Does every movie shown on<br />\ncampus have to be screened to<br />\nmake sure no scene is derogatory<br />\nto some group? I hope it never<br />\ncomes to this, but the News-Letter<br />\nis on a dangerous road. McCarthy defined liberals, civil libertarians and many others who<br />\ndisagreed with him as Communists. Is everyone who annoys<br />\nthe radical feminists doomed to<br />\nbe labeled as sexist?<br />\nWhen the News-Letter preaches<br />\nabout \"promoting tolerance on<br />\ncampus,\" they should keep in<br />\nmind that censorship of free<br />\nspeech is antithetical to tolerance.<br />\nIt is in this spirit that I encourage<br />\nanyone who disagrees with the<br />\nbasic tenents of this article to respond in next week's News-Letter.<br />\nYou see, everyone is entitled to<br />\ntheir own opinion: even<br />\nMcCarthy ists<br />\nDan Abrams<br />\n<br />\nEditor's note: At no point did\u2022we<br />\nadvocate the censorship ofeither<br />\nLETTERS, from 6<br />\n<br />\nVAMOS<br />\nAO<br />\nBRASIL!<br />\nWORK.

In their<br />\nopinion, the cartoon was simply<br />\nin poor taste.<br />\nEach of us on the Spectator<br />\neditorial board fully abhor the atthe<br />\nin<br />\ndepicted<br />\ntitude<br />\ncartoon. The attitude is sexist,<br />\nutterly<br />\nderrogatory, and<br />\nrepulsive. Nevertheless, the attitude does exist on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. One can easily find<br />\nmany instances of male Hopkins<br />\nstudents talking in such a manner.<br />\nMany readers seem to have<br />\nforgotten that this is an editorial<br />\ncartoon, and as such, it is not<br />\nmeant to endorse this attitude.<br />\nAny cartoon, whether it be found<br />\non the editorial page of a<br />\nnewspaper or in the comic section, attempts to take a slice of<br />\nlife and present it under a<br />\nmicroscope for all to see. The<br />\n\"2x +I\" cartoon does exactly<br />\nthis, for it forces us all to confront<br />\nsexism on campus.<br />\nThe cartoon has, therefore,<br />\nsucceeded in its task. It has forced us all\u2014both males and<br />\nfemales\u2014to reevaluate our attitudes toward the opposite sex.<br />\nIt has stimulated discussion of<br />\nsexism; before the cartoon was<br />\npublished, there was very little,<br />\nif any, serious discussion of this<br />\nimportant issue. Open discussion<br />\nof prejudices is always more<br />\nfruitful than the suppression and<br />\nfailure to acknowledge such attitudes. As long as discussion is<br />\noccurring, we are all kept aware<br />\nof the problem of sexist attitudes,<br />\nand we can do something to<br />\nchange them.<br />\nBefore such discussion occurs,<br />\nwe should all become responsible readers and should not<br />\nmisconstrue the cartoonist's intent. As we said before, this was<br />\na cartoon. The two males<br />\ndepicted in it were not intended<br />\nto be people whom we should<br />\nrespect. Instead, they looked silly and repulsing. We all became<br />\nconscious of the sexist attitudes<br />\nthat do exist on campus. As Carl<br />\nPezua wrote in a letter last week,<br />\n\"This comic strip made me<br />\n<br />\nthink\u2014really think\u2014about the attitudes and sensitivities of<br />\nHopkins students.\" In my opinion, the cartoon fully served its<br />\npurpose.<br />\nSandeep Kishan<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nThe Spectator<br />\n<br />\nAPL<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing in regard to the article entitled \"APL Tests<br />\nMissiles\" by Mr. Stephen<br />\nMizrach in your issue of<br />\nFebruary 2. I do not wish to<br />\n[dispute] any of the points which<br />\nMr. Mizrach makes in his article,<br />\nbut I do dispute the objectivity of<br />\nhis coverage.<br />\nIt appears from the text of his<br />\narticle that Mr. Mizrach relied<br />\nexclusively on testimony from<br />\nprofessional peace activists (or at<br />\nleast people willing to be described as peace activists). Now, it<br />\nshould be obvious that any peace<br />\nactivist will oppose nuclear<br />\ntesting in any form. At the very<br />\nleast, Mr. Mizrach could have included a statement by someone<br />\nfrom A.P.L.(or, for that matter,<br />\nthe Navy) as to the role of Trident II in protecting America's<br />\nsecurity interests in what he quite<br />\ncorrectly describes as a time<br />\nwhen \"Soviet military response<br />\nis so unpredictable.\"<br />\nThere is no doubt that nuclear<br />\nweapons, in and of themselves,<br />\nare horrible and disturbing things.<br />\nBut they are also a component of<br />\nAmerica's national defense which<br />\nhas negated the threat of world<br />\nwar for over forty years. Only<br />\nafter journalists such as Steve<br />\nMizrach begin to write more<br />\nbalanced articles can the general<br />\nreadership (of this paper or any<br />\nother) become cognizant of the<br />\nbenefits as well as the costs of our<br />\nnation's nuclear capabilities.<br />\n<br />\nLetters Policy<br />\n<br />\nCouncil<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs president of the Student<br />\nCouncil I would like to inform<br />\neveryone of two very important<br />\nchanges to the regular functions<br />\nof the Council. First, our weekly meetings for commitee<br />\nbusiness and open discussions<br />\nwill be held in the Shriver Hall<br />\nBoard Room every Wednesday<br />\nevening at 1:00 p.m. unless<br />\notherwise posted. This is one<br />\nhour earlier than before and as<br />\nusual the meetings are open to all<br />\nstudents.<br />\nSecond, the Student Council<br />\noffice has been moved to the first<br />\nfloor of Levering Hall adjacent to<br />\nthe StudeTit Activities Office.

McColl<br />\n<br />\nA tangible bittersweetness coats every frame of<br />\nPaul Mazursky's exceptional \"Enemies, A Love<br />\nStory.\" Although the film can be quickly described as the adventures of a man who is married to<br />\nthree women, some far more grueling machinations are at work here. Herman Broder and his<br />\nwives are Holocaust survivors, part of a select few<br />\nwith permanent, unthinkable stains on their<br />\nmemories.<br />\nBased on an Isaac Bashevis Singer novel,<br />\n\"Enemies\" is such a compelling tale that one<br />\nalmost misses its larger, more insidious themes.<br />\nHerman (Ron Silver) is a struggling writer who<br />\nsurvived the Nazi scourge through the aid of Yadwiga (Margaret Sophie Stein), a Polish peasant<br />\ngirl who sequestered him in her hayloft during the<br />\nwar. Married out of Herman's sense of obligation, they now live together on Coney Island,<br />\nalthough he continues to see camp survivor Masha<br />\n(Lena Olin) on the side.<br />\nHerman's marital responsibilities are laced with<br />\nguilt: when he's about to forget Yadwiga entirely, he hears the barking dogs of the German occupation, and feels the blows that<br />\nYadwiga withstood to preserve their secret. Yadwiga'a link to Herman is both maternal and<br />\nchildlike\u2014she cleans up after him while begging for his approval. Herman can't abandon the<br />\nwoman who saved his life, no matter how unattractive he finds her. And Masha is always there<br />\nto satisfy his obsessive craving for intimacy.<br />\nThe scenes between Masha and Herman are the<br />\nmost revealing in \"Enemies\"; they are convincing expressions of mutual need. The pair make<br />\nlove as if they were the last two people on earth.<br />\nThey have learned to cherish each moment<br />\ntogether since they hardly expected to have any.<br />\nFor the survivors of \"Enemies\" there is no hiding<br />\nin years of psychological bandaging; every emotion is brutally up front. One gets the sense that<br />\nsomething has been carved away against their will,<br />\nand that the healing will begin only after they bring<br />\nanother person as close as is possible.<br />\nWhen Herman promises Masha a Catskills vacation and then waffles at the last minute, she fumes<br />\n<br />\nThe renovated Albee plays went up this past<br />\nweekend, this year under the name \"Theatre Lab\"<br />\nbecause Edward Albee did not return this year.<br />\nThe intersession course was instead taught by<br />\nmore contemporary names in the theatre world,<br />\nsuch as Tina Howe and Jennifer Warren. The<br />\nchange in personnel was made as the result of<br />\ngeneral dissatisfaction with the course and production of last year's plays. Despite everyone's<br />\nbest efforts and intentions, however, there still remains a great deal of room for improvement.<br />\nTo begin with, the plays were performed in what<br />\nis typically the stage-right section of the audience.<br />\nThis was intriguing at first. Upon entering the<br />\ntheatre, one found the chairs placed on stage for<br />\nthe patrons to sit in, and lighting stands set up in<br />\nvarious parts of the auditorium, (the standard<br />\nlighting was useless in the areas used during the<br />\nperformance).<br />\nAfter the initial wonder wore off, however, the<br />\nrealisms hit. It is my guess that this cut down on<br />\nthe number of available seats, although I could<br />\nnot say for certain; if it did not, it certainly cut<br />\ndown severely on the number of good seats, as<br />\nthe audience's view was obstructed by railings,<br />\nlighting racks, and in some cases, shadows. Other<br />\ninconveniences included the fact that there was<br />\nno miking, so those actors with weaker voices<br />\nwent largely unheard in the sound-proofed room.<br />\nAdditionally, the view of the playing area was difficult to see from the lighting booth, and as such,<br />\nit was necessary for Jennifer Warren to give<br />\nlighting cues from the audience, which was<br />\ndistracting to those sitting around her.<br />\nThe evening's production began with Joshua<br />\nColeman's \"On the Web,\" a play about a<br />\ngentleman returning home from work on the subway who is suddenly accosted by a youth who fancies himself a comic-book hero of sorts. The play<br />\nlargely centers around hi assorted rantings and<br />\nself-discoveries, played convincingly by Jeff Perlstein, who presented a perfect picture of an 80's<br />\n\"young tough,\" though his excessive nervous<br />\nlaughter seemed inconsistent with the character.<br />\nHis movement, which at times drew one away<br />\nfrom his lines, was nonetheless energetic and<br />\nstrong. In fact, Perlstein was able to carry such<br />\nstrength into the play's more difficult lines, as in<br />\na speech on Greek mythology with phrases like<br />\n\"hooves of doom,\" which otherwise might have<br />\nfallen flat. The rest of Spiderman's speeches were<br />\nalso excellent, for that matter, largely due to<br />\nstronger writing.<br />\nIn the background, meanwhile, was Ed Einhorn<br />\nas Sal, the late train's other passenger. At the<br />\nplay's beginning, Einhorn does well with very little, sitting extremely still and shifting his eyes as<br />\nthe youth jumps around him, periodically spitting<br />\nout a line just to pacify the youth. It is when Sal<br />\nneeds to stand on his own that Einhorn falters.<br />\nThis may be due in part to the poor flow of the<br />\nwhole piece\u2014the jumps from exposition to plot<br />\nconflict to other plot conflict, etc., were drastic<br />\nand heavy-handed\u2014but the speech Sal makes<br />\nabout his job is well-written. Unfortunately,<br />\nEinhorn's whiny tone offered comedy where irony<br />\nwas needed.<br />\nThe play's progression from this point is obvious: the boy gets nervous and has a gun, so<br />\nnaturally he must shoot the innocent passenger.<br />\nThe fight scene was poorly acted as well, and quite<br />\nfrankly, I just didn't buy the moment when Spidey<br />\nSee THEATER, 15<br />\n<br />\nand begins to stalk off. But realization hits her,<br />\nand she turns back to Herman. He sighs and<br />\nshrugs, blinking slowly, as if to say that he's doing the best he can. Masha is the one who solidifies<br />\nthe most powerful moments in \"Enemies.\" Her<br />\nunblinking desire for truth makes her a genuinely tragic figure when the truth finally hits.<br />\nHerman discovers that Tamara (Anjelica<br />\nHuston), his wife from Europe, is alive and living in New York. She has returned from the dead,<br />\nin a sense: she survived burial in a mass grave,<br />\nalthough neither of the couple's children was so<br />\nfortunate. With a bullet still lodged in her hip,<br />\nTamara walks with mock sensuality\u2014she is Herman's safe alternative, the known quantity who<br />\nno longer appeals to him in the same complete way<br />\nshe once did.<br />\nMasha wants to be made an \"honest woman,\"<br />\nand Herman obliges at about the same time that<br />\nYadwiga announces she is pregnant with his child.<br />\nThe idea of three wives has the potential to<br />\ndegenerate quickly into hijinks, but there's no such<br />\ntendency in \"Enemies.\" The film glides on such<br />\na high level that conventional flaws can hardly<br />\nreach it.<br />\nAs things grow tougher for Herman, the<br />\npossibility of leaving it all behind grows increasingly attractive. His three wives are more than just<br />\nmanifestations of a freewheeling libido. He is<br />\nresponding to the God that has turned its back on<br />\nthe Jews. \"There is no God,\" he says to Yadwiga, \"and if there were, I would defy him.\"<br />\n(This drives Yadwiga to tears, since she has converted to Judaism to win his affections.) Despite<br />\nhis flaws, Herman is a convincing and empathetic<br />\ncharacter: there isn't a hint of malice in him.<br />\nThe actors in \"Enemies\u2014 are sensational; they<br />\npractically bleed their belief in the material. Silver<br />\nand his character are a tight fit, and Huston turns<br />\nin another sterling supporting performance. As<br />\nMasha, Lena Olin is simply devastating.<br />\nMazursky and co-writer Roger Simon reveal only brief glimpses of the Nazi horrors that plague<br />\n<br />\nIn Paul Mazursky's \"Enemies, A Love Story,\"<br />\n(clockwise from top) Ron Silver and Lena Olin;<br />\nAnjelica Huston\u2014outstanding performances.<br />\nthese characters. \"Enemies\" replaces visual cluc<br />\nwith psychological ones, an even more frightening demonstration of the Holocaust's impact on<br />\nits battered survivors.

Backed by D.J.<br />\nMark the 45 King (who is also perhaps the rap<br />\nproducer of the year), \"All Hail the Queen\"<br />\nboasts the guest talents of De La Soul, Stetasonic's<br />\nDaddy-0, KRS-One, and Monie Love, as well as<br />\na lyrical outlook similar to the Jungle Brothers'.<br />\nA lot of the raps on \"All Hail the Queen\" offer Latifah the chance to put down racism,<br />\nviolence, and sexism; or to play sly, posturing<br />\ncharacters, as on the goofy \"Mama Gave Birth<br />\nto the Soul Children.\" Latifah speaks righteously, and when the mix starts to match her beat with<br />\nsampled sound from Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix, and<br />\neven The The, it's a genuine privilege to be a part<br />\nof her queendom.<br />\nGraham Parker\u2014Human Soul(RCA)<br />\nDespite Graham Parker's demonstrated<br />\nsongwriting ability, there's something oddly unsatisfying about \"Human Soul.\" Certain songs<br />\nare superb, as strong as anything of their kind.(4.<br />\nspecial mention should go to \"Daddy's A<br />\nPostman,\" a truly hilarous look at the postcardperfect American family.) Parker's political stance<br />\nis commendable, as well, though he has jumped<br />\non the bandwagon with \"Slash and Burn,\" his version of the requisite save-the-rainforest song that's<br />\nseems destined to show up in some form on every<br />\nalbum this year.<br />\nSo what's wrong here? A few years ago, this<br />\nmight have been a groundbreaking record. But the<br />\nnagging feeling that \"Human Soul\" generates,<br />\nespecially after two or three listenings, is that this<br />\nis all-too-familiar territory. Parker clearly owes<br />\na great deal to Elvis Costello; besides their similar<br />\nvoices, Parker's production style (even his inconsistency) is reminiscent of Elvis's.

The<br />\nmembers of the group remain<br />\nloyal to a protean, occasionally !oopy repertoire (several hundred songs strong) and, as their<br />\nJanuary 30 performance at<br />\nHammerjack's made clear, they<br />\nplay it with a peerless rapport.<br />\nNot that they flaunt it: The<br />\nprimary concern at the Hammerjack's show was, as always<br />\nwith NRBQ, entertainment.<br />\nThe group ripped through one<br />\nrafter-shaking tune after another<br />\n(\"Crazy Like a Fox,\" \"Get<br />\nRhythm,\" \"12 Bar Blues\") and<br />\nonly rarely came up for air, as<br />\nin guitarist Al Anderson's<br />\n<br />\nearnest rendition of \"Make<br />\nLove Not War\" early in the<br />\nfirst set.<br />\nYet even the poor sound<br />\nsystem and the dense, raucous<br />\ncrowd could not mask the<br />\nband's remarkable musicianship.

The<br />\ngroup also gave prominent billing to songs from its recent<br />\n\"Wild Weekend\" (Virgin), of<br />\nwhich the delightful \"The One<br />\nand Only\" and \"Fraction of<br />\nAction\" were standouts.<br />\nNo performance of the New<br />\nRhythm and Blues Quartet<br />\nwould be complete, however,<br />\nwithout at least one song that<br />\nthreatened to pervert the mood<br />\nof the entire show. \"White<br />\nChristmas\" was the culprit at<br />\nHammerjack's, in a version<br />\nSee CONCERTS, 15<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/15<br />\n<br />\nMOVIES<br />\n<br />\nNew 'Stella' Falls Short of<br />\nIts Predecessor and its Story<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nIn John Erman's \"Stella,\"<br />\nBette Midler has both a good role<br />\nand a potentially great story<br />\nbefore her. Barbara Stanwyck<br />\nfirst played the doting and<br />\nanguished Stella Claire in 1939,<br />\nin a film (and a performance) that<br />\nmany now consider a classic. Yet<br />\nfrom the evidence of the new<br />\n\"Stella,\" one is led to suspect<br />\nthat both Erman and Midler were<br />\nprepared to ride on the coattails<br />\nof the earlier film.<br />\nThe choppy storyline begins as<br />\nStella is made pregnant by a<br />\nyoung medical student (Stephen<br />\nCollins), who agrees to do the<br />\nright thing and marry her. She<br />\nelects to raise the child herself,<br />\n<br />\nhowever, and after Jenny is born,<br />\nStella's main objective in life appears to be making her happy.<br />\nYet the spectre of father always<br />\nlingers. Jenny meets her wellsituated father repeatedly over the<br />\nyears (illustrated in a time-elapsed<br />\nseries of ice cream sundae lunches) and grows up before the audience's eyes. Although Jenny is<br />\nliving under her mother's roof,<br />\nthe film glosses over roughly a<br />\ndozen years of her life (in the<br />\naforementioned scene) with next<br />\nto no mention of Stella. Whatever<br />\ninsight we might gain from seeing them \"grow up\" together is<br />\nblacked out.<br />\nEven in Jenny's early years<br />\n(presumably before she started<br />\ngoing out for ice cream), the rap-<br />\n<br />\nport between she and Stella seems<br />\ncliched. Though Stella's love may<br />\nindeed be perdurable and genuine, it comes across as nothing<br />\nspecial: Stella brushes Jenny's<br />\nhair, puts on her pretty dresses<br />\nand Mary Jane shoes, etc.<br />\nWhen Jenny grows up, she no<br />\nlonger seems very appealing. The<br />\nadolescent<br />\nJenny<br />\n(Trini<br />\nAlvarado) spends most of her<br />\ntime looking physically exhausted, and she certainly isn't<br />\nvery lovable\u2014a quality that<br />\nwould make Stella's crude,<br />\ndown-home affections at least<br />\nplausible, if not necessarily likely.

Curiously, there isn't an<br />\nounce of tension in these scenes:<br />\nBoth parents are so accomodating<br />\nto Jenny that they come across as<br />\nmerely bland and uncommitted.<br />\nThe filmmakers, unfortunately, are committed in a different<br />\nway. Throughout \"Stella\" there<br />\nare constant (and not very subtle)<br />\nshifts of contrast, from Stella's<br />\nsparse furniture and clothes to the<br />\npomp and elegance of the father's<br />\nsurroundings. The carrot has<br />\nbeen mounted on the stick for<br />\nJenny, one would assume, but<br />\n\"Stella\" tries repeatedly to lure<br />\nthe au6ience into its materialist<br />\nmindset. It's difficult not to feel<br />\nfor Stella: not only is she poor<br />\nand in danger of losing her<br />\ndaughter, her own film is against<br />\nher, as well.<br />\nAt the same time, Midler often<br />\ncomes close to swallowing the entire picture with her presence.<br />\nStella Claire is a jewel of a role,<br />\nand Midler knows it. In her<br />\n<br />\neuphoria to play it faithfully, she<br />\npractically strangles the character<br />\nto death. She is constantly talking too loudly, slamming doors,<br />\njumping onto bars, and the like,<br />\nthreatening at times to swamp the<br />\nentire picture.<br />\nThis is compounded by director John Erman's weighty<br />\ndramatic atmosphere, which<br />\nseeks to add emotional intensity<br />\nwhere none is necessary or even<br />\npossible. When Stella decides to<br />\nhave her child alone, early in the<br />\nfilm, the audience is supposed to<br />\naccept her decision as fatalistic:<br />\nStella is destined to have an arduous, unfulfilling life.

The<br />\nmonologue focused on a grandmother reminiscing on her late husband and their experiences in<br />\ngrowing old. But in the short time it went on, it<br />\nexplored the fear of technology, sex after sixty,<br />\nromance, antagonism in marriage, fear of<br />\nlonliness, and a host of other subjects. Bragen's<br />\nwriting is bright, funny, and strong, and Nancy<br />\nWerner's performance as Eula was nothing less<br />\nthan endearing. She did little more than sit in a<br />\nrocking chair and point her finger to Heaven, but<br />\nher voice was all she really needed. It made \"Body<br />\nParts\" the best part of the evening.<br />\nThen came another monologue, \"Rhiannon's<br />\nBane,\" written by Douglas Barre, also an actor,<br />\nand performed by Robin Brillante. The segment<br />\nconcerned a teenager making a trip to the free<br />\nclinic for the obvious and her explanation to the<br />\ninvisible doctor (receptionist? nurse?) about why<br />\n<br />\nshe is taking the step that she is. Perhaps it's just<br />\nthat it is a man writing about a woman's anxiety<br />\nbefore an abortion, perhaps not, but this just didn't<br />\nwork well at all, particularly in the wake of<br />\nsomething as fresh as \"Body Parts.\"<br />\nThe idea is hackneyed, and Barre handles it<br />\nvaguely. After all, this woman is planning to have<br />\nan abortion, yet she tells a story (again from Greek<br />\nmythology) about a goddess punished for killing<br />\nher baby, then says that she didn't want to feel<br />\nlike she was killing hers. Confusing. Even given<br />\nthat poetic license, however, neither Barre's<br />\nwriting nor Brillante's performance convinced me<br />\nthat this character would delve deeply into Greek<br />\nmythology to explain her own pregnancy.<br />\nThe segment did have one terrific aspect,<br />\nhowever: Brillante's face. For whatever her words<br />\nlacked, her face supplied: a wrinkled brow and<br />\npursed smirk for naive confusion, a slight tilt for<br />\nshame or embarrassment. While these devices<br />\ncouldn't always drag the writing up onto a higher<br />\nlevel, her expressions, at least, stood far enough<br />\nabove the text to be noteworthy.<br />\nSee THEATER, 16<br />\n<br />\nOPEN HOUSE<br />\nWEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1990 3:00-5:00 PM<br />\nREFRESHMENTS IN THE HOMEWOOD MAIN LOBBY & MCCOY SOCIAL LOUNGE<br />\nSTUDENT HOUSING TOURS OF THE BALTIMOREAN, HOMEWOOD, AND MCCOY APARTMENTS<br />\n<br />\nntis,<br />\n<br />\nAiti\"0<br />\n\u2022gr.,ao<br />\nt.<br />\n<br />\nLottery information session<br />\nTuesday, March 6 at 7:00<br />\np.m. Multi-purpose room\u2014<br />\nAMR I<br />\n<br />\n1988 Creative Mt<br />\n<br />\ncervices<br />\n<br />\n\"HAVING CHOICES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH FINDING A COMFORTABLE FIT.\"<br />\nThe Housing Office Staff invites you to participate in the OPEN HOUSE festivities!!<br />\nk<br />\n<br />\n\f16/FEBRUARY 9, 1990<br />\n<br />\nTHEATER<br />\n<br />\nTheatre Lab's Highs and Lows<br />\nTHEATER, from 15<br />\nThen came \"Volunteers,\" David Dudley's play<br />\nabout three men in a government drug testing experiment. Douglas Barre played the neophyte<br />\nGreen to comic excellence, hitting all the whines<br />\njust right, but rarely letting them go too far, prodding the other two men (Red in particular) just<br />\nthe right amount. Andrew Bragen played the<br />\nworldly irate Red, whose main goal seemed to be<br />\ngetting free food, a free place to stay, and his<br />\nmoney. While the role was small, Bragen filled<br />\nit well, turning otherwise gratuitous cursing into<br />\neffective punctuation in the scenes. Unfortunately, the character itself was the weakest of the three,<br />\nserving as the explainer and mediator of the other<br />\ntwo.<br />\nBut when Blue (Josh Coleman) entered in the<br />\nfirst scene, it was as if electricity were suddenly<br />\npumped onto the stage. He wore his character like<br />\nmost people wear an old coat\u2014he was comfortable, and knew exactly how to wear it to make<br />\nit look good. You really believed that he was<br />\nbrain-fried from too many previous experiments.<br />\nWhile most actors would use nervous tics to flush<br />\nout a character, Coleman used them as explanations of his own. His tapping fingers and rubbing<br />\nhands were expressions both of drug abuse and<br />\nof fear\u2014fear of going outside, fear of staying in,<br />\nand fear of the power of the other two men over<br />\nhim, for if anyone leaves or loses control of<br />\nhimself, we were told, the experiment is off.<br />\nThe three worked together beautifully, so well<br />\nin fact that it became tough to say if it was good<br />\nacting or good writing or both. Green and Red<br />\nseemed to rely on Blue for information, and Blue<br />\non them as well, though the audience was never<br />\ntold what for. By the third scene, the audience<br />\nknew that they'd been cooped up in that room for<br />\nthree weeks, watching the same movies, building<br />\nforced comradery, eating Twinkies, smoking<br />\ndope, and getting on each others' nerves. In one<br />\nscene, Green badgered Red by counting randomly while Red did sit-ups. Red lost count of how<br />\nmany he'd done, and nearly punched Green until<br />\nBlue reminded him of the violence clause in the<br />\nexperiment agreement. Later in the same scene,<br />\nhowever, in a beautifully comic reprisal, Green<br />\nbegan banging his head against the wall in frusration, and Red, realizing that the experiment and<br />\nhis paycheck would be cancelled, began counting<br />\nrandomly, hoping Green would lose track of how<br />\nmany times he had hit himself.<br />\nUnfortunately, Dudley needed maybe one more<br />\nscene to pull off the ending. When Blue slammed<br />\nhis way out of the experiment, it felt as though<br />\nthe tables had turned too quickly and too obviously<br />\n<br />\nfor a play of this intelligence. Something is missing, and while the ending works, given what<br />\npreceded it, it could work better.<br />\nAfter intermission, Elin Hilderbrand came out<br />\nand performed Salvatore Zannino's \"Pageant.' In<br />\nit, Aria Alexander is about to go out for the evening wear segment of a beauty pageant and in an<br />\nespecially inane speech, she comments on her<br />\nlooks in a mirror. Hildebrand had only 45 seconds<br />\nto save herself from the mire of the writing and<br />\nthe hurried miming of make-up application, and<br />\nunfortunately, it just wasn't enough time. She was<br />\nforced to deliver lines that begin with \"Oh, Lynda Carter,\" and \"Oh, Liz Taylor\" and ended by<br />\ninsulting these actresses in ways that were neither<br />\nclever nor poignant in terms of her character. The<br />\npiece had no apparent purpose, except to waste<br />\nHilderbrand's considerable talent.<br />\nThe fourth and final monologue, \"American<br />\nGeisha,\" was written and performed by Kerry<br />\nTesoriero. It concerned a stock person at a clothing<br />\nstore as she (rather amorously) considered a<br />\nfemale co-worker. Tesoriero swayed and stared<br />\nand spoke deeply, offering an erotic tension so<br />\nintense that I thought the two women were<br />\nhomosexual. The writing was tremendous, and the<br />\nimages Tesoriero created accentuated the tones she<br />\nestablished, one such image being the \"faux-lizard<br />\nsling-gack pumps, green\" that surfaced at just the<br />\nright moments. Toward the end, however,<br />\nTesoriero introduces the co-worker's boyfriend\u2014<br />\nare these merely voiced mental musings? Still, as<br />\nin the case of \"Volunteers,\" strong acting<br />\nthroughout, and strong writing that paled towards<br />\nthe end.<br />\nThe final piece of the evening was Nathan Potter's \"Rubber Bullets.\" Jason Katz played Alex,<br />\na cleaning man who works in a bar owned by an<br />\nalcoholic, wife-beating jerk named Dennis (Carl<br />\nLarkin). Alex is friendly with the bartender, Lenny<br />\n(Raymond Parungoa), who offers advice on Alex's<br />\naffections for Dennis's wife, Cara. Alex is essentially a milquetoast who lets himself be bullied,<br />\nhumors himself, and tries to humor others by offering artistic criticism on Martin Scorcese's film<br />\n\"Taxi Driver\" (based on notes no doubt taken<br />\nin Linda Benn's film class last semester). When<br />\nAlex manages to get a gun away from a mugger<br />\n(the second one he has encountered that day), he<br />\nbecomes filled with delusions of changing his life<br />\nby killing Dennis and stealing Cara away. In the<br />\nend of course, he can't go through with it, and<br />\nthe play ends largely the way it begins.<br />\nJason Katz truimphs over very difficult material<br />\nin this play, giving a depth to his character that<br />\nis lacking in the other three performers. He<br />\n<br />\nGOLD RING SALE<br />\n$75 OFF 18K<br />\n$50 OFF 14K<br />\n$ 5 OFF 10K<br />\n<br />\nmanages to make even the most awkward scenes<br />\nwork as best they might(including Alex's impersonation of Robert DeNiro's psychotic<br />\nconfrontation with his mirror in Taxi Driver).<br />\nRaymond Parungao also does an admirable job<br />\nwith his material as Lenny, but unfortunately, he<br />\njust doesn't deliver the amount of realism that Katz<br />\ndoes\u2014some of his lines are just too unreal to be<br />\ndelivered well. Carl Latkin as the abusive, weighttrained Dennis moved too stiffly and spoke too<br />\ndeliberately to be intimidating, but moreover his<br />\ncharacter was just inconsistent, though this is a<br />\nflaw in the writing. For example, told that his wife<br />\nhas cheated on him, why doesn't he beat her<br />\nsoundly when he has the chance? We are told he<br />\nhas done this before, for less of a reason. Julia<br />\nRo's character suffers from many of the same<br />\nproblems\u2014if she is so rational and determined to<br />\nstay with her husband, why does his display of<br />\nuncaring send her to Alex's apartment? And if she<br />\nisn't intelligent enough to have left her husband<br />\nor to get help for him, or to understand Alex's<br />\ncomments on the movie, then how is she able to<br />\nfigure out Alex's scheme\u2014even Lenny isn't that<br />\nbad a liar. She knows that killing is crazy, but<br />\ndoesn't realize cheating on her physically abusive<br />\nhusband is crazy. Unfortunately, these inconsistencies proved to be too much for Ro who was<br />\nbelievable scene to scene, but not as a whole<br />\ncharacter.<br />\nBut the root of the problems with the acting stem<br />\nfrom the play itself. Apart from the inconsistent<br />\n<br />\ncharacters mentioned above and the obviously<br />\nplagarized elements from Taxi Driver, the movement of the play just doesn't work. Potter<br />\nestablishes such extreme characters at the beginning of the play that he has nowhere to take them<br />\nbut to mediocrity. Alex is so spineless that the gun<br />\nmight have the legitimate ability to send him over<br />\nthe deep end and kill Dennis, but he doesn't. Dennis is so self-centered and ill-tempered that realizing that Alex has cuckolded him would be enough<br />\nreason for him to kill Alex when he gets the chance.<br />\nBut he doesn't. And the scene ot the two men<br />\nabout to kill each other playing with a real gun<br />\nshould be enough to make even someone as<br />\nunintelligent as Cara realize that the two men are<br />\ndangerous, but it doesn't. On top of which is the,.<br />\nquestion of the gun itself. One of the first things<br />\na writer is told is an old adage by Chekov, which<br />\nstates, \"if you put a gun on the wall in Act I, you'd<br />\nbetter have used it by Act V.\" Potter sets himself<br />\nup with a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't<br />\nsituation. If Alex does kill Dennis, or vice-versa,<br />\nthen that's too obvious. But because the gun never<br />\ngets used, the audience is left feeling unfulfilled,<br />\nas though they have just watched nothing change.<br />\nThe intersession program did an admirable job<br />\nin the time they had to work in. But the limitation of time, added to the already disorienting notion of not performing on stage may have proven<br />\nto be too much, for, in many cases, they seemed<br />\nto fall short of polished work.<br />\n<br />\nRECORDS<br />\nRECORDS, from 14<br />\narrangements were deranged as their lyrics, relying upon insane combinations of saxophone,<br />\naccordian, and almost any other instrument<br />\nimaginable.

For those individuals<br />\nwho have made the decisions to be sexually active, the best protection is consistent use of condoms in conjunction with spermicidal<br />\nfoam, jellies, or creams.<br />\nIn the 1990's, the sexually transmitted disease that will make the<br />\nfront page of \"Time\" magazine and dominate the science sections<br />\nof newspapers is that caused by the Human Papilloma Virus. As with<br />\nother sexuallly transmitted diseases, infection rates are highest among<br />\nadolescents and college students. A study done at the University of<br />\nWashington (Seattle) showed that 17 percent of sexuallly active<br />\nwomen were infected with HPV. At Hopkins, approximately ten percent of students have some evidence of HPV infection.<br />\nThere are over 50 strains of this virus. Some strains typically cause<br />\nwarts on the skin. Other strains cause warts to develop anywhere<br />\non or in the male or female genital tract. Warts may develop on the<br />\npenis or scrotum or on the vulva, in the vagina or on the cervix.<br />\nBoth males and females can develop warts around the anus even if<br />\nthey do not engage in anal intercourse. Visible warts usually develop<br />\nin two-thirds of individuals who have intercourse with an infected<br />\npartner. The time from infection to the appearance of visible warts<br />\n<br />\nby Alan Joffe<br />\nMedical Director, Student Health Clinic<br />\nThe two most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases on college<br />\ncampuses today, Johns Hopkins University included, are Chlamydia<br />\nTrachomatis and Human Papillorna Virus (HPV). Over the last<br />\ndecade, the symptoms, complications and treatment for chlamidial<br />\ninfections have been well delineated. For HPV infection, optimum<br />\nidentification and treatment strategies have only begun to emerge.<br />\nChlamydia Trachomatis is an organism that can only live within<br />\ncells of the body. It most commonly infects genital tract cells but<br />\ncan infect other areas as well. Approximately ten percent of sexually active college students get this infection; nationwide, infection rates<br />\nare highest among people 15-24 years of age.<br />\nSymptoms of infection usually develop within two weeks of exposure to this organism. Among males, the urethra is most commonly<br />\ninvolved. Typically, students complain of discharge from the penis<br />\nand/or burning when they urinate. However, many infected males<br />\nmay have no symptoms whatsoever yet are still capable of transmitting the infection to their partner.<br />\nFor females, the most common site of infection is the cervix; women<br />\nmay seek treatment for a vaginal discharge. However, since this<br />\norganism can also infect the urethra, a woman may experience burning when she urinates. This symptom is also experienced by women<br />\n<br />\nJohn /Asa<br />\n<br />\nSorry...it takes more than a \"Fiesta\" colored condom to impress this<br />\nNineties woman. But, your sensitivity and knowledge of safer sex is<br />\ndefinitely appreciated.<br />\n<br />\nwith a bladder infection; hence, women who seek treatment at the<br />\nStudent Health Clinic for a presumed bladder infection are often<br />\nqueried about and evaluated for the possibility of infection with<br />\nchlamydia. Again, many women with Chlamydia Trachomatis infections lack any symptoms; consequently, routine screening for this<br />\norganism is a regular part of annual gynecologic exams at the Clinic.<br />\nEven though the symptoms of this infection are often mild or even<br />\nnonexistent, the consequences of untreated infections can be<br />\ndevastating, especially for women. This organism can gain access<br />\nto the uterus and fallopian tubes, setting up an intense inflammation<br />\nthat can result in scarring which leads to infertility and/or an increased<br />\nrisk for ectopic pregnancy (an abnormal pregnancy in which the fertilized egg grows in the fallopian tube rather than the uterus.) Fortunately, ther are several inexpensive tests that can identify individuals<br />\neven if thay have no symptoms. All of these techniques are available<br />\nthrough the Student Health Clinic.<br />\nOnce an infection is detected, treatment is relatively simple. A student need only take doxycycline, tetracycline, or erythromycin for<br />\nseven to ten days. Successful treatment, and limitation of spread of<br />\nthis organism, requires notification of all recent sex partners. Unfortunately, infection does not confer immunity: one can be infected<br />\nwith chlamydia as often as one is exposed to a partner with this infection. Many individuals erroneously believe that use of birth control pills protects against chlamydia infection. In fact, use of the pill<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION<br />\nAll Sophomores<br />\nand<br />\nJuniors:<br />\nApplications for Community<br />\nAssistants and Student<br />\nAssistants are now available<br />\nfrom the Residential Life<br />\nOffice, Housing Office, and<br />\n1-G Wolman.<br />\n<br />\nDeadline for applications is<br />\nFebruary 23 (Friday).<br />\n<br />\nSee CONDOM, 19<br />\n<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\n<br />\nJay contemplates...\"Sex?

However, recent research has established a link<br />\nbetween HPV infection and the development of cancer of the cervix<br />\nin women. This is not to say that any woman with genital warts will<br />\ndevelop cervical cancer. Rather, sexually active women with HPV<br />\ninfection appear to be at higher risk for developing cervical cancer<br />\nthan sexually active women who do not have such an infection. The<br />\nmagnitude and nature of the risk has yet to be worked out. A piece<br />\nof the puzzle appears to be that certain strains of HPV that cause<br />\ngenital warts have the capability of transforming normal cells into<br />\ncancerous cells whereas other strains of genital HPV do not. It is<br />\nalso likely that other factors\u2014as yet unidentified\u2014play a role.<br />\nAny male who has any concerns that he has genital warts should<br />\nseek care at the Student Health Clinic. Those who have been told<br />\nby their sex partners that they are infected should seek care even<br />\nif they personally cannot detect any warts.<br />\nWe make this recommendation because many males may have infection that can only be detected through use of a magnifying glass<br />\nand a vinegar wash.<br />\nFifty to sixty percent of women with warts on their external genitalia<br />\nwill also have cervical infection. However, only three to six percent<br />\nof women with cervical HPV infection will have external genital<br />\nwarts. Hence, use of a PAP smear as a regular component of the<br />\nannual gynecologic exam has become more critical than ever. The<br />\nmost common cause of a persistently abnormal PAP smear among<br />\ncollege women is the presence of HPV infection. Hence, women<br />\nwhose PAP smears remain abnormal even after they receive treatment for other sexually transmitted diseases, will likely require further evaluation, usually by a gynecologist at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital. This is because physicians who look at PAP smears cannot readily distinguish between changes associated with HPV infection and those seen in early cervical cancer.<br />\nTreatment of external genital warts usually consists of applications<br />\nof a resin called podophyllin or liquid nitrogen. Depending on the<br />\nsize of the wart, six or seven treatments, one week apart, are often<br />\nneeded. Warts in the vagina or penis or on the cervix require more<br />\nspecialized treatment, usually by a gynecologist or urologist. Because<br />\nthe DNA from the wart virus can be incorporated into normal human<br />\ncells, HPV infections can persist and be very difficult to treat. Since<br />\ninfection with one strain does not confer immunity against other<br />\nstrains, one can be infected multiple times. It also appears that one<br />\ncan be reinfected with the same strain even after successful treatment. As with any sexually transmitted infection, notification and<br />\ntreatment of sex partners is critical.<br />\nHow do you protect yourself against infection? Again, condoms<br />\nused with spermicides offer the best protection. Condoms offer a<br />\nmechanical barrier of protection while the active ingredient in spermicides (nonxyno1-9) appears capable of killing the wart virus. Use<br />\nof condoms will also decrease your risk of getting AIDS. In many<br />\nparts of the world, condoms are the primary means of contraception; among the Japanese, almost two-thirds of sexually active males<br />\nregularly use condoms. If we are to stem the \u2022 epidemic of sexually<br />\ntransmitted diseases in the United States, we need to follow their lead.<br />\n<br />\nHILLCREST CLINIC<br />\nPrompt confidential help<br />\n\u2022 FREE PREGNANCY TESTING<br />\n\u2022 ABORTION SERVICES<br />\n\u2022 BIRTH CONTROL SERVICES<br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br />\n<br />\n788-44001<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 SONOGRAMS<br />\n\u2022 COUNSELING<br />\n\u2022 COMMUNITY EDUCATION<br />\n<br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n830 500pm<br />\n<br />\n:7An<br />\n<br />\n5602 Baltimore National Pike *600<br />\n<br />\nthatiumot\u00b1)0nm:1-Au f:<br />\nomit*<br />\ntta ,1591.6DX*(n)*1990*(i L< 11,<br />\n<br />\n%3Eil<br />\ntJ14<br />\n<br />\n1991*5E*()*7<br />\n<br />\nOR*4.1.`i/S -C<Dfli101113ZAItil,CIM,;819i-<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 rzIs8s500s -clottfk0ittit s<br />\nebalca5tr_TOa..* roc*TElitfrO)41-1)(<br />\nto<br />\n\":16!gillitclVilkoDialt,<br />\ni!),<br />\nLiair6OgglifficillatIS10Ye.

Hopkins began<br />\nFebruary trailing second-place<br />\nWidener by one game in the<br />\nMAC Southeastern Division and<br />\nfacing a tough league foe, Ursinus, on the road. Coach Bill<br />\nNelson was asked before the<br />\ngame whether Hopkins was<br />\nfavored to win. \"Are you kidding? They beat us down here fat<br />\nHopkins] last time!\" Had Nelson<br />\nknown that his leading scorer,<br />\nAndy Enfield, would be held to<br />\neleven points, he would have<br />\nbeen even more concerned than<br />\ncoaches usually are in such situations. The Jays came through,<br />\nhowever, to beat Ursinus 75-72<br />\nwith a balanced offensive attack,<br />\nsetting up a showdown for second<br />\nwith Widener.<br />\nThe Widener game began with<br />\na strong defensive effort and a<br />\nprecisely run offense. Unfortunately for Hopkins, both were<br />\nput forth by Widener, who quickly went up 10-0.

By the time the half ended, the Jays were down 30-13. To<br />\nsay they were struggling on offense would be quite an<br />\nunderstatement.<br />\n<br />\nWidener came in with a simple but calculated game plan to<br />\nstop Hopkins and proceeded to<br />\nexecute it to perfection. On offense, they played a slow-down<br />\ngame, running the 45-second shot<br />\nclock down to 10 practically<br />\nevery offensive trip. At that moment, the Widener coach would<br />\nyell \"Ten!\" and one of the<br />\nWidener guards would look to<br />\ndrive and create. Amazingly,<br />\nWidener was able to get good<br />\nshots off, even with the shot clock<br />\nrunning down, and finished the<br />\ngame 23-for-44 for 52 percent.<br />\nOn defense they played a zone<br />\nthat extended out to the threepoint circle and retracted back into the lane with astonishing<br />\ncelerity. The Jays tried their usual<br />\nzone-breaking scheme by putting<br />\nEnfield and Jay Gangemi just outside the three-point circle, and<br />\nBill Zahn on the baseline. Zahn,<br />\nhowever, wasn't able to connect<br />\non his first three attempts from<br />\nthat location and the Widener<br />\nguards and forwards were very<br />\nquick to jump out on Enfield<br />\nwhenever he touched the ball.<br />\nThis occasionally left Gangemi<br />\nopen, who had hit 46 percent of<br />\nhis three-pointers on the season.<br />\nBut this wasn't to be his night,<br />\nunless there were recent job<br />\nopenings in the bricklaying industry, as Gangemi was only able<br />\nto connect on three of twelve<br />\ntreys and three of fourteen shots<br />\noverall, finishing with nine<br />\npoints.

In this instance Eikenberg's unwillingness<br />\nto launch the three-pointer seemed to limit Hopkins' attack.

Hopkins was<br />\nalso unable to get the ball inside<br />\nthe zone either by inlet passes or<br />\npenetration.

The I, the<br />\nsubjective self.\" The unconscious<br />\n\"is most evident to us in two<br />\nplaces\u2014in dreams and in fantasies.\" These basic notions of<br />\nSwiss psychologist Jung and<br />\nAustrian psychoanalyst Sigmund<br />\nFreud are \"subject to a lot of<br />\ndebate,\" she said. \"Dreams are<br />\nmetaphorical statements,\" she<br />\ncontinued, transmitted in \"symbolic and metaphoric language.\"<br />\nA brief history of dreams<br />\nfollowed, and Campbell-Scott<br />\nremarked that although dreams<br />\nfigured prominently in the Old<br /><br />\nand New Testaments and in many<br />\npast societies, Americans are frequently skeptical about them.<br />\n\"You shouldn't be daydreaming\" is a common sentiment here,<br />\nshe said.<br />\nBut dream study can be<br />\nbeneficial, she stated, paraphrasing Jungian analyst James Hall's<br />\nview that \"by paying attention to<br />\nour dreams we can enlarge our<br />\nconsciousness\" and \"become<br />\naware of issues that have driven<br />\nus . . . as we become more aware<br />\nof our unconscious, we become<br />\nmore aware of choices.\" Jung,<br />\nshe said, held that \"aspects of<br />\nourselves that we are unaware of<br />\nare in our unconsciousness and<br />\nmanifest themselves in dreams.\"<br />\nShe added that dreams might contain elements of a dreamer's<br />\nindividuation, the process<br />\nwhereby one develops a sense of<br />\nidentity.<br />\nA practical method to study<br />\ndreams, Campbell-Scott said, is<br />\nto pay close attention to, and to<br />\nquestion extensively the details of<br />\nthe dream. \"Put a notebook by<br /><br />\nyour bed to write it down,\" she<br />\nsaid of a hypothetical dream, and<br />\n\"tell yourself before you sleep to<br />\ndo it . . . once you have the<br />\ndream itself, what is the setting?\"<br />\nAlso important is \"the dream ego<br />\n. . . the I in the dream . . . the<br />\npart that is most like your conscious ego.\" One should<br />\nscrutinize, she continued, the<br />\nissues, conflicts, and people surrounding the dream ego.<br />\nShe stressed that other objects,<br />\nsuch as a house, a method of<br />\ntransportation, or animals in the<br />\ndream could also be important.<br />\n\"All of those tell you something<br />\nabout yourself.\" One should Ask<br />\n\"what are the feelings [you]<br />\nassociate with it\" and \"what does<br />\nit mean to [you]?\"<br />\nAlso, one could \"ask what are<br />\n[your] associations in the dream<br />\nto what happened in the day,\" or<br />\ndetermine \"your own association<br />\nto each element of the dream.\"<br />\nCampbell-Scott said that some<br />\ndreams feature characters from a<br />\ndreamer's past, a character the<br />\nscarcely<br />\nmight<br />\ndreamer<br /><br />\nremember. This person, of the<br />\nsame sex as the dreamer, was<br />\ncalled a \"shadow figure\" by<br />\nJung. The figure might represent<br />\n\"a rejected part of yourself' and<br />\ncan be \"a way of getting in touch<br />\nwith some rejected aspect of<br />\nyourself.\"<br />\nOne might talk to a shadow<br />\nfigure, or another mysterious<br />\ndream character, to learn more<br />\nabout it, Campbell-Scott noted.<br />\nThe dreamer could try, during the<br />\ndream, \"asking the question and<br />\nthen letting the answer be<br />\nwhatever it is . . . if it gets scary<br />\n. . . then stop it. You don't have<br />\nto keep going. You are not under<br />\na very powerful spell.\"<br />\nThough some forget their<br />\ndreams, Campbell-Scott said<br />\n'<br />\n\"you can discipline yourself\"<br />\nthrough practice and effort to<br />\nenhance dream retention.<br />\nOne \"can learn a great deal inside and out of therapy,\" by<br />\nstudying dreams, she said. \"I<br />\nthink it enriches our lives.\"<br /><br />\nBSN<br />\nSTUDENTS.<br /><br />\nIN<br /><br />\nEnter the Air Force<br />\nimmediately after graduation \u2014 without waiting for the<br />\nresults of your State Boards.

This often leads to<br />\nfeelings of frustration or a need<br />\nto escape to a fantasy environment because the person is<br />\nmisdirecting his feelings. The<br />\ntraditional role of women called<br />\nfor non-assertive behavior:<br />\nwomen were taught to be polite<br />\nand kind even when they did not<br />\nwant to.<br />\nThe consequences of nonassertive behavior can be serious.<br />\nThe most common result is<br />\ndepression. Feelings of low selfesteem or self-worth can also<br />\ndevelop as a result of nonassertiveness. Boswell explained<br />\nthat studies have been done which<br />\nshow that people who display<br />\nnon-assertive behavior often fail<br />\nto achieve personal goals or build<br />\nsuccessful relationships<br />\nA second type of behavior<br />\nDean Boswell identified was aggressive behavior. Aggressive<br />\nbehavior is defined as behavior<br />\nused by an individual to achieve<br />\nsomething which denies others<br /><br />\ntheir personal rights. Aggressive<br />\nbehavior includes a tone of voice<br />\nwhich may be loud or cold, a stiff<br />\nor uncomfortable stance, and<br />\ntense or hostile facial expressions.<br /><br />\nSometimes people who are inwardly insecure use aggression to<br />\ndivert attention from themselves.<br />\nOther explanations for aggressive<br />\nbehavior include childhood experiences, previous success or a<br />\nfear of loss of power. Aggressive<br />\nbehavior is expressed verbally<br />\nthrough the use of \"loaded\"<br />\nwords, which are words that can<br />\nhave multiple meanings. It can<br />\nalso be displayed through the use<br />\nof sarcasm or insults.<br /><br />\nBoswell discussed was assertive<br />\nbehavior. She defined it as<br />\n\"behavior which allows a person<br />\nto act in his or her own interest<br />\nwithout denying the rights of<br />\nothers.\" Assertive behavior is<br />\nphysically displayed with a relaxed, confident posture and facial<br />\nexpressions which are congruent<br />\nto what is being said.<br /><br />\nA person who is assertive is<br />\nable to freely express his own<br />\nneeds to others. This is a result<br />\nof a positive self-image and good<br />\nself-esteem. An assertive person<br />\nis able to achieve personal goals<br />\nbut by using negotiation and compromise rather than threats and<br />\nbullying.

According to Boswell,<br />\nagressive behavior is essentially assertive person, according to<br />\nself-destructive because one is Boswell, is to use your mind.

As a result, he or she has the<br />\nThe third type of behavior self-assuredness to listen to others<br /><br />\nand formulate an opinion which<br />\nwill truly reflect the way he or she<br />\nfeels. Dean Boswell suggested<br />\nthat one should start out by asking a simple question: \"Are you<br />\ngetting what you want?\" If the<br />\nanswer is no, then one should<br />\nrationally think about what the<br />\nproblem is and how to approach<br />\nit.<br />\nBoswell concluded her lecture<br />\nwith a list of myths about<br />\nbehavior. The first myth is that<br />\nassertive behavior is destructive<br />\nand wasteful. The second myth is<br />\nthat if one states how one truly<br />\nfeels about a relationship, the<br />\nother person will not be able to<br />\nhandle it. Boswell said one shold<br />\nnot feel responsible for the way<br />\nothers react.<br />\nby<br />\nBoswell concluded<br />\nenumerating a few essential rights<br />\nthat everyone has: the right to be<br />\nthe ultimate judge of one's self,<br />\nthe right not to justify one's<br />\nbehavior, the right to change<br />\none's mind, and the right to make<br />\nmistakes and take responsibility<br />\nfor those mistakes.<br /><br />\nStudent Council resumes Rotunda Shuttle<br />\nCOUNCIL, from 2<br />\ncouraged attendance of the class'<br />\nopen meeting next Wednesday at<br />\n6:00 in the SAC Lounge and has<br />\narranged tickets for \"Les<br />\nMiserables\" to be sold for $16.00<br />\nstarting Monday.<br />\nIn open discussion, Junior<br />\nClass Representative Munia<br />\nMitra commented that the Student<br />\nHealth Advisory Committee<br /><br />\nneeds interested students to help while the School of Continuing<br />\nprovide the student body with bet- Studies will still provide some<br />\nter information concerning the courses in the evening.

McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: the<br />\npostman cometh . . .<br />\nToday I pull yet another letter<br />\nfrom the bulging bag of fan mail<br />\nthat I receive every week from<br />\nyou readers at home. This week's<br />\npostal tidbit comes from Nelson<br />\nFinefare, an imaginary Biology<br />\nmajor, who asks:<br />\n\"Dear Chris: Every week you<br />\nreceive a bulging bag of fan mail<br />\nfrom your readers at home, but<br />\nyou never respond to any of it in<br />\nyour column because you're too<br />\nbusy using it to misrepresent your<br />\nfriends. Wouldn't it be more efficient to just write us back, via<br />\nthe good old U.S. Postal<br />\nService?\"<br />\nThe fact of the matter is that<br />\nI'm afraid to use the mail ysstem.<br />\nMy explanation begins with two<br />\nelements: my obsessivecompulsive behavior, and the<br />\ntoaster oven that my brother<br />\nbought me last year for Christmas<br />\n(which I still haven't opened).<br />\nPerhaps this explanation will be<br />\nof use to those of you who, for<br />\nwhatever reason, don't get<br />\naround to writing people you<br />\nknow.<br />\nI have a friend who lives in<br />\nFlorida with a toaster oven just<br />\nlike the one I just mentioned. We<br />\nare very close, at least as close<br />\nas two people who see each other<br />\nat most one week out of each year<br />\ncan be.<br />\nI submit (and I don't think my<br />\neditors will disagree with me<br />\nhere) that were I to begin writing<br />\nto her, my letters would be<br />\nsimilarly long-winded. But it<br />\nwould take too long for me to<br />\nfinish each letter, and the guilt<br />\nwould build up, along with an<br />\nobsessive-compulsive urge to<br />\nend letter after letter. So,I would<br />\n'probably end up sending a page<br />\nof a letter every day.<br />\nI think it's safe to assume that<br />\nanyone would get annoyed trying<br />\nto read a letter a page at a time,<br />\nso she would collect my letters in<br />\na brown bag in her kitchen, promising herself that she'd open<br />\nthem all up one day and read<br />\nthem, while each night she'd just<br />\nrationalize a different reason as<br /><br />\nto why she hadn't opened them.<br />\nOne night she'll say it's<br />\nbecause she's in a hurry to get to<br />\naerobics class. This will be the<br />\nclass, of course, in which she<br />\nmeets that tall, handsome stranger<br />\nwearing Eau-de-recent-graduateof-Penn-business-school-who'sin-Florida-to-make-a-killing-inthe-condo-game, and the two will<br />\nwalk along the beach and talk into<br />\nthe wee hours. He will try<br />\nnothing more daring than a goodnight kiss, because he's really<br />\nvery sensitive, and it just doesn't<br />\nfeel right, besides he doesn't want<br />\nto do anything that she doesn't.<br />\nShe insists that she's got to go<br />\nbecause she's got to get up early<br />\nfor work and oh my God it's<br />\nalready 3:30.<br />\nWhile Rourke writes his<br />\nnumber on the back of the letter she got from me that day, she<br />\nexplains that she was going to<br />\nwrite to me the other day, but she<br />\nhad to get her toaster oven<br />\nrepaired. Of course, she got there<br />\njust as the place was closing, so<br />\nthey couldn't fix it anyway. The<br />\nsensitive Rourke will know exactly how she feels, because he's<br />\nbeen having trouble with the<br />\nphone company.<br />\nThe next morning, she'll hurriedly grab her toast on her way<br />\nout, knocking the toaster oven off<br />\nthe counter and into the bag filled with my letters, yanking the<br />\nplug out of the wall as it fall, but<br />\nshe'll be so late that she won't<br />\nhave time to fix it. She'll get to<br />\nit later. Anyway, it's unplugged.<br />\nBut while she's gone, the<br />\nheating elements inside the<br />\nmachine, which are, of course,<br />\nstill glowing, will come in contact with one of my letters, and<br />\nstart it smouldering, eventually<br />\nigniting the whole bag and<br />\ndestroying all of my work.<br />\nAt this point, however, she's at<br />\nwork smiling goofily, daydreaming about Rourke and playing<br />\nwith the envelope with his phone<br />\nnumber. Her boss walks past,<br />\nstartling her, and she rips open<br />\nthe letter as though it's some imSee PUNCHLINE, 5<br /><br />\nHere a condom. .<br />\nWhile flipping through the pages of the News-Letter to<br />\nfind the crossword puzzle, some of you were probably surprised to find a condom inserted within its pages. The<br />\npapers delivered to the Homewood campus this week contain condoms, not as some stunt done for shock value or<br />\na good laugh, but rather to stress the importance of education and responsibility in practicing safe sex.<br />\nTwo years ago, when the News-Letter first delivered<br />\ncondoms with its Valentine's Day issue, most Americans<br />\ncould not say the word \"condom\" in mixed company<br />\nwithout people raising their eyebrows or laughing nervously. Since then, education has been instrumental in not only lowering the condom's mystery and embarrassing<br />\nreputation, but also in teaching people about<br />\nthe benefits of using condoms.<br />\nThe condom is not just a means of contraception. Using a condom correctly can protect both you and your partner from the spread of many sexually transmitted diseases.<br />\nThe Health Center suggests the following simple steps to<br />\nsafe sex with a condom: 1) Ensure before use that the condom's package is sealed, and that it has been stored in a<br />\ncool, dry place. If you are unsure of how long it's been<br />\nsulking around your apartment, don't use it. 2) While putting on the condom (which can be an intimate part of<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nforeplay and not just an embarrassing pause in the middle<br />\nof things), make sure there is space in the tip to act as a<br />\nreservoir and then roll it all the way on to the penis. 3)<br />\nUse lubricants that are water-soluble and contain a spermicide such as Nonoxyl 9. 4) After climax, remove the<br />\nerect penis before it relaxes in the vagina. Hold the condom at its base and be careful not to tear it as you slowly<br />\nwithdraw. 5) Another important step in using a condom<br />\nis discussing the decision to use one with your partner.<br />\nOpening the channels of communication can improve an<br />\nalready intimate relationship. It is important to remember<br />\nthat just because a man wears the condom, the choices and<br />\nresponsibilies involved are not his alone, but those of his<br />\npartner as well.<br />\nIn providing you with condoms, the News-Letter is not<br />\ninviting you to drape them from trees, inflate them in class,<br />\nor scatter them all over Gilman. What we do hope is that<br />\nyou will deal with them responsibly, even if this means<br />\nthrowing them, unopened, into the nearest trash bin.<br />\nAdditional information on condoms and safe sex is<br />\navailable at the Health Center. Condoms are available there<br />\nfor a dollar a dozen. The Union Desk also has a wide selection, in a variety of shapes, colors and styles, available<br />\nfor your perusal.<br /><br />\nThe right to write<br />\nIt has been suggested that a Hopkins publication might<br />\nbe in jeopardy of losing its funding, as well as SAC<br />\nrecognition, were it to publish something which the majority of the SAC board found distasteful or inappropriate.<br />\nSuch an intrusive move on the part of the SAC would not<br />\nbe a good idea.<br />\nWhen editors are presented with material which may be<br />\noffensive to certain groups or individuals on campus, they<br />\nmust be allowed to make the decision as to whether or not<br />\nthe material is fit for publication. To mandate \"tolerance,\"<br />\nby setting strict guidelines as to what the SAC or the<br />\nUniversity finds offensive, is to render such a decision<br />\nmeaningless. As it has been said before, one cannot<br />\nlegislate morality.<br />\nStudent government, or the University administration,<br />\nmust be clearly separated from student publications. For<br />\na publication to be meaningful, its editors must have a certain level of responsibility for its contents. An editor must<br />\nhave the right and responsibility to edit staff work (letters<br /><br />\nto the editor are another issue). If a reader doesn't like<br />\na certain journal's bias or choice of material, he or she<br />\nshould be able to choose another or even begin his or her<br />\nown publication, with the SAC's blessing and funding.<br />\nProliferating campus publications would yield a wider<br />\nrange of ideas and forums, the aggregate result being a<br />\nbetter representation of campus awareness through a variety of editorial boards. The SAC, as an arm of the student<br />\ngovernment, must stay out of this entire process, aside<br />\nfrom acting as a facilitator. If the SAC,or the Administration, were to set artificial publication content guidelines,<br />\nthey might well be guilty of censorship.<br />\nWe suggest that the SAC invest in a desktop publishing<br />\nsystem, complete with a set of terminals, software and a<br />\nlaser printer,which would be available to any group which<br />\nwanted to publish. The consequential growth in the campus press would both invigorate campus intellectual life,<br />\nand remove the pressure from existing publications to be<br />\nall things to all people.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nHomewood II<br />\nHomewood I<br />\nThe following letter was<br />\ndistributed to the Homewood<br />\ncommunity this past week.<br /><br />\nTo All Members of the<br />\nHomewood Community:<br />\nThe cartoon published in the<br />\nHopkins Spectator, Volume 2,<br />\nIssue Number 3, is of concern.<br />\nIt is this sort of publication that<br />\nhelps create and promote an environment accepting sexism. In<br />\naddition, it promoted an irresponsible attitude towards the consumption of alcohol. It is in opposition to the mission of an institute of higher learning.<br />\nAs the Deans of Homewood<br />\nSchools, we are committed to improving the climate at Homewood<br />\nfor all members of the Community. We applaud the Student Activities Commission for taking action and scheduling a hearing and<br />\nfeel confident that appropriate action will be taken.<br />\nIt is our goal to establish an environment that is sensitive to the<br />\nneeds of inidividuals within the<br />\ncommunity and fosters tolerance<br />\nand the pursuit of knowledge. We<br />\nurge all members of the<br />\nHomewood Community to support and assist us in creating an<br />\nenvironment that is conducive to<br />\nthis goal.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn response to a letter received by \"all members of the<br />\nHomewood Community\" I question the commitment our university hierarchy has towards \"improving the climate at<br />\nHomewood.\" Those who signed<br />\nthe letter seemed to feel that an<br />\nimprovement in our community<br />\nshould come through censorship<br />\nof student publications. It has<br />\nlong been tradition that universities allow students to use their<br />\nown discretion in deciding what<br />\nis proper for print and what is inappropriate. If the students feel<br />\nthat what they are reading is offensive, they should react responsibly and with maturity, not by<br />\nrunning to the nearest university<br />\nofficial. It is absolutely inconceivable that the proper way<br />\nto respond is through censorship.<br />\nOn the masthead of\"The Johns<br />\nHopkins News-Letter \"it says:<br />\n\"Student Publication Since<br />\n1897.\" I beg the Jesse Helmses,<br />\nthe Joseph McCartheys, and the<br />\nfascists of the university administration, to allow the students<br />\nto continue free publication, and<br />\nto keep the ninety-three year old<br />\nstudent publication alive and<br />\nuncensored.<br />\nAvi Fisher<br />\nAndrew B.

You might have concluded that James Rosen had drawn<br />\nsome kind of \"racist...ignorant'<br />\ncartoon about the Snack Bar staff<br />\nhere at Hopkins.<br />\nIf you read all five of the letters<br />\nthat conspired to generate this<br />\nconclusion, you may then consider yourself acquainted with a<br />\nstandard hypocrisy and disdain<br />\nfor you, the reader, that you probably will never again encounter<br />\nwith printed material.<br />\nLetters to the editor are usually persuasive efforts, and these<br />\nwere no different save for one<br />\naspect. You were told that you<br />\nwould certainly agree with these<br />\npeople if you were allowed to see<br />\nRosen's drawing, but that you<br />\nshould not see the strip in the first<br />\nplace, because it might upset you.<br />\nThese were thus the first letters<br />\nto the editor I've ever read whose<br />\nauthors sought to deny you the information that would most win<br />\nyou to their sides.<br />\nYou were also led to believe<br />\nthat the undeniability of this conclusion, that I draw racist cartoons, stems from the diversity of<br />\nbackground in those who felt<br />\nequipped to comment on it. Five<br />\npeople who somehow had more<br />\nright than you to see this cartoon...as well as five attendants<br />\nof the same meeting of a single<br />\nstudent group, which looks about<br /><br />\nas impartial as five Klansmen<br />\ntestifying together.<br />\nIt would seem to me, then, that<br />\nany such persuasive efforts would<br />\nbe consigned to failure ifjust one<br />\nperson, after finishing the fifth<br />\nletter, thought to him or herself:<br />\n\"Well, what did the comic strip<br />\nactually SAY?\" What could these<br />\nletter writers respond to you\u2014<br />\n\"Uh, trust us on this one, really.\" It's like asking a jury to<br />\nbelieve that a photograph shows<br />\nthe murder in action, without<br />\nshowing the jury the photograph.<br />\nThe reason for not printing the<br />\ncartoon is, simply, that my<br />\ndetractors are afraid of what you<br />\nmight do if you saw this cartoon.<br />\nCarlos Pezua, who complained<br />\nabout two comic strips in one<br />\nweek, claimed that my drawing<br />\nwould prompt from you \"a tirade<br />\nof racial outbursts.\" Throughout<br />\nthis sorry episode, I have never<br />\nwavered in my trust of your ability to read and think for<br />\nyourselves, like some have, nor<br />\nhave I ever believed, as some,<br />\nthat a cartoon would lead you to<br />\nviolent behavior.<br />\nPersonally I find the idea of<br />\ntrying to debate the merits of a<br />\nconcealed picture kind of...insipid...and so I will not demean<br />\nyou, as some have, by asking you<br />\nto believe anything at all about the<br />\nstrip until you've seen it for<br />\nyourself.<br />\nAs for my detractors' logic,<br />\nthat is there for all to see. Mr.<br />\nPezua wrote, \"The problem with<br />\nthis comic strip is that it harshly<br />\nadresses a sensitive issue.\" I<br />\nwould characterize Do The Right<br />\nThing in the same way.<br />\nGeorge Lerner told you I<br />\nbordered n Fascism while asking<br />\nyou to convict me on unseen<br />\nevidence\u2014much like a show trial<br />\nin a...Fascist...country. \"Look,<br />\nwe got five people to say it!\" Mr.<br />\nLerner also lamented to you the<br />\nSee LETTERS, 6<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nDouglas Munro<br /><br />\nSpeaker's Comer<br /><br />\nRebecca Garron<br />\nIt is about time that the Hopkins<br />\nCommunity\u2014male, female,<br />\nBlack, White, Gentile or Jew,<br />\nfaculty or student\u2014recognized<br />\nthe pervasive institutionalization<br />\nof sexism, racism, and exclusivism. It is also time for<br />\nspecial interests groups to<br />\nreevaluate their criticisms of Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel's cartoon, which I<br />\nwould like to defend from<br />\nimpassioned<br />\nmisdirected,<br />\ncriticism.<br />\nI am a member, in no prioritized order, of the female, white,<br />\nand Jewish Hopkins communities, and am painfully aware<br />\nof the prejudices directed at the<br />\nmembership of at least two of<br />\nthese. I am also aware that<br />\n\"special interest\" groups, being<br />\nhuman, are fallible, and, when<br />\nvictimized, can rashly critize<br />\nwithout fully understanding the<br />\ncomplexities of an issue.<br />\nMr. Podurgiel's cartoon,<br />\nthough lacking intellectual skill<br />\n(i.e. it is impossible to decipher<br />\nhis postion), is not necessarily<br />\nsexist. His cartoon rendered,<br />\nthrough a not-so-comic comic<br />\nmedium, a conversation to which<br />\nevery male and female at Hopkins<br />\nhas been subjected; that is the<br />\nbelief first, that women at<br />\nHopkins are physically unattractive, and second, the real sexism,<br />\nthat in fact the only way in which<br />\nto acknowledge women is as sexual entities. (It might be interesting to note that the cartoon<br />\nfurther implies that Hopkins men<br />\nare incapable of any kind of relationship sans alchohol). His cartoon does not necessarily agree<br />\nwith those beliefs, nor does it<br />\nnecessarily suggest that Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel espouses those beliefs.<br />\nThe cartoon is perhaps a means<br />\nby which to publicize the existence of those beliefs, and obviously, it did so successfully.<br />\nThis is an important distinction.<br />\nI can not speak for Mr.<br />\nPoduirgal's sensibilities; I can<br />\nonly hope to draw attention to the<br />\nGOOD MORNING,<br />\nROOF. P PENNY<br />\nFOR YOUR<br />\n-rmooGHTS<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\ntn<br /><br />\ncartoon so that we can all ask<br />\nwhat it means and in what ways<br />\nit is productive to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. I do hold Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel responsible for his<br />\nwords. Having explicitly invited<br />\ncriticism, it is now his obligation<br />\nto respond to those criticisms.<br />\nMr. Podurgiel?<br />\nBoth the victimized and the victimizers are members of the<br />\nHopkins community. We all have<br />\nresponsibilities to that community, and there are productive ways<br />\nof confronting divisive issues.<br />\n1. Censorship is not the<br />\nanswer. Women's groups in particular have called for the suppression of sexist material. Censorship only creates a violently<br />\npressurized silence beneath which<br />\nbreeds prejudice and misconceptions, both of which, given time,<br />\nwill explode in our faces. A more<br />\nproductive way of confronting<br />\nand eradicating prejudice is to<br />\npublicly engage those who nurture such prejudice. Either<br />\nboycott those publications which<br />\nencourage ignorance or use those<br />\npublications as a vehicle of<br />\ndebate. The responsibility is not<br />\nto denounce, but to inform.<br />\n2. Obviously, it is not only the<br />\nvictimized who are responsible<br />\nfor eradicating the ignorance<br />\nunderlying<br />\ndestructive<br />\nmisconceptions. Publications, the<br />\nadministration, and special interest groups alike are responsible for providing a forum in<br />\nwhich all can engage in healthy<br />\ndiscourse. The most blameworthy in this entire situation is not<br />\nMr. Podurgiel, nor individual<br />\nsexists (though they contribute to<br />\nthe problem), nor any one special<br />\ninterest group. It is The Spectator, a publication which does<br />\nnot even pretend to have an agenda and which chooses to attack<br />\nthe personal qualities of individuals, rather than discuss<br />\nissues in any depth. If asked. I am<br />\nboth happy and prepared to provide examples of The Spectator's<br /><br />\nDO YOU 864,e-YE<br />\nIN LovE?<br /><br />\ninept journalism. If not asked, I<br />\nwill assume that The Spectator is<br />\nnot only incompetent but<br />\napathetic, that they are aware of<br />\nhow irresposible and shallow is<br />\ntheir publication, and that by their<br />\nsilence they consent to agreement. Our responsibility then is<br />\nto demand that SAC pull its funding from The Spectator or that<br />\nit financially aid a competing and<br />\nresponsible publication.<br />\n3. No group on campus is solely responsible to itself; women's<br />\ngroups (i.e. the Women's Center)<br />\nshould publicly denounce not<br />\nonly sexism, but racism, financial<br />\nirresponsibility, etc. Jewish<br />\ngroups (i.e. JSA), Black groups<br />\n(i.e. BSU), and all special interest<br />\ngroups are obligated to speak out<br />\non issues that divide the community, regardless of whether or<br />\nnot they are the most visible and<br />\nimmediate victims. Every student<br />\nshould demand administrative<br />\nresponsibility: they've admitted<br />\nfemale bodies; it's time they've<br />\nadmitted female intellect.<br />\nEveryone should seek to eradicate<br />\nthose organizations which encourage exclusivism. The fraternity system should be held accountable for its exclusivism.<br />\nFrats are a potentially powerful<br />\nand productive social force, and<br />\nshould be responsible for active<br />\nsupport of special interest groups<br />\non campus.<br />\nIf we can't eradicate prejudice<br />\nin the containment of academia,<br />\nwe will be unable to hinder its<br />\nreproduction in society at large.<br />\nThis is a call to the university,<br />\nand that includes all and any in<br />\nany way affiliated with Johns<br />\nHopkins; let's examine our own<br />\nsensibilities, and reevaluate a<br />\nsystem in which we accept the<br />\ndisgusting display of selfproclaimed superiority and the<br />\nconsequent denial of others<br />\nhumanity.<br /><br />\noH, You MeAll 7-1,/AT..<br />\nLOVe?

The<br />\neditors fo the News-Letter have<br />\nno such excuse for the labeling of<br />\nthe Spectator as \"campus'<br />\nequivalent of the Dartmouth<br />\nReview.\" This is a wholly unjust<br />\ncomparison.

This is not entirely true:<br />\nthe Review receives no funding<br />\nfrom the organization, though it<br />\nis a member of the same umbrella<br />\ngroup, the Collegiate Network.<br />\nBut then so are 52 other campus<br />\npublications. Are they all to be<br />\ntarred with the same brush?<br />\nMoreover, if it truly was simply<br />\nthe funding question that the<br />\neditors meant to draw attention<br />\nto, I feel sure that slightly less<br />\nloaded phraseology would have<br />\nbeen employed.<br />\nTo the editors of the NewsLetter: if you want to be sanctimonious about editorial responsibility, you might just want to<br />\nstart at home.<br />\nAs for everyone else, while I<br />\ncannot say that we Spectator staff<br />\nrelish being harangued in the corridor, we acknowledge your right<br />\nto do it.

In<br />\nlast week's News-Letter there<br />\nwere six letters referring to a<br />\nJames Rosen cartoon which I<br />\ndon't remember seeing published. It turned out that my memory<br />\nhadn't failed me\u2014the cartoon had<br />\nbeen suppressed and five of the<br />\nletters were messages of congratulation to the editors for a job<br />\nwell done. It turned out that the<br />\nfive letter writers saw the cartoon<br />\nin a meeting of the Black Student<br />\nUnion. It also turned out that the<br />\nNews-Letter has a circulation of<br />\nsix-thousand. After some simple<br />\nsubtraction I realized that not too<br />\nmany people are going to be able<br />\nto contextualize the remarks of<br />\nRosens's critics, cogent though<br />\nthey may be.<br />\nThen my memory began working overtime, and I recalled an<br />\nunpleasant incident this summer,<br />\nwhich was reported in the<br />\nnewspapers and on television, so<br />\nmany News-Letter readers might<br />\nrecall it as well. Robert Mapplethorpe, a photographer of<br />\nsome renown and now deceased,<br />\nwas to have his work exhibited at<br />\nthe Concoran Gallery in<br />\nWashington D.C. The exhibit<br /><br />\nwas to be sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts,<br />\nuntil Senator Jesse Helms protested due to the homoerotic<br />\nnature of some of the<br />\nphotographs. NEA funding was<br />\nrevoked and the exhibit was moved to a smaller gallery amid controversy and debate. Newspaper<br />\nand television standards are such<br />\nthat none of the photographs in<br />\nquestion could appear for the<br />\npublic on whose behalf,<br />\npresumably, the debate began.<br />\nMany students who are pleased to<br />\nsee James Rosen's cartoon<br />\nrailroaded out of existence were<br />\nprobably outraged at the attempt<br />\nto supress Mapplethorpe's work.<br />\nMany of the arguments against<br />\nthe publicaton of the cartoon,<br />\nspecifically those forwarded by<br />\nGeorge Lerner, Makeba Lindsay,<br />\nand Craig Freeman mirror those<br />\nof Senator Helms in opposition to<br />\nthe Mapplethorpe exhibit.<br />\nIt is arrogant of the News-Letter<br />\neditors to presume to moderate a<br />\ndebate which their own restrictive<br />\neditorial policies have considered<br />\nmoot. (It is perhaps this same arrogance which compelled the<br />\nNews-Letter. to run an editorial<br />\nabout its editorial policies over<br />\nthe editorial on our new president.) If this debate is to continue<br />\nthe cartoon must be published.<br />\nNewspapers, like government,<br />\nserve a public need. When they<br />\ntry to dictate public need to serve<br />\nthemselves their function<br />\ndeteriorates into self-abuse.<br /><br />\nFinally, is it sexist to think a<br />\nwoman homely? Or must one's<br />\nconcept of beauty also be radically democratic making all<br />\nbeautiful as to not offend anyone?<br /><br />\nDavid Cohen<br /><br />\nCartoon IV<br /><br />\nAdam Mazmanian<br /><br />\nEditors'note: We can only repeat<br />\nthat Mr. Rosen was a member of<br />\nour staff, and therefore subject to<br />\nediting. We would oppose any attempt to penalize a publication<br />\nwhich decided to run his strip,<br />\nalthough wefeel under no obligation to do so ourselves.<br /><br />\nCartoon III<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI must take issue with some of<br />\nthe opinions raised in last week's<br />\nissue of the News-Letter. George<br />\nLerner says that \"the idea<br />\nborders on Fascism\" that James<br />\nRosen should be allowed to print<br />\nwhatever he wants. Although<br />\ncommon sense should be sufficient to discover the moronic<br />\nreasoning behind such a conclusion, maybe a more complete<br />\ncriticism is required. Fascism<br />\nproperly defined is a form of<br />\ngovernment that unites business<br />\nand state leadership with a<br />\nbelligerent nationalism. The most<br />\n\"successful\" form of fascism is<br />\ntotalitarianism which is a society<br />\nbased on extreme unity and<br />\nauthoritarianism, usually some<br />\nform of dictatorship. Totalitarian<br />\nregimes make much use of propaganda, a word which originates<br />\nfrom the Catholic counterreformation and the Holy Office<br />\nfor the Propagation of the Faith.<br />\nCensorship is an authoritarian<br />\nconcept as is coercive propagation of faith (whatever that faith<br />\nmay be\u2014for example religion and<br />\nradical democracy.)<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nMcCarthyist-type<br />\ndemagoguery in the name of<br />\nwiping out sexism, racism, antisemitism and homophobism is a<br />\ngrowing problem at Hopkins.<br />\nThe News-Letter's decision to<br />\njoin with the Women's Center in<br />\nsupporting the censorship of the<br />\n\"2x +1\" strip is particularly<br />\ndisturbing.<br />\nI didn't expect anything more<br />\nfrom the Women's Center.<br />\nFeminists at Hopkins have traditionally thrived on finding<br />\nsomething with sexual overtones<br />\nand changing it into the most<br />\nhorrible piece ever written. This<br />\nis precisely the strategy used by<br />\nJoe McCarthy in his battle against<br />\nCommunism. In the past, The<br />\nWomen's Center has even<br />\nresorted to opening other people's<br />\nmail, as Mr. Ellis so eloquently<br />\npoints out. This is a federal offense, but nothing new to Joe<br />\nMcCarthy and his disciples.<br />\nThe Women's Center should<br />\nalso keep in mind that they don't<br />\nspeak for all the women at J.H.U.<br />\nMost females I have talked with<br />\nhave no problem with the comic<br />\nstrip; some even found it funny.<br />\nAs for the News-Letter's reaction, I am stunned. McCarthyistlike fringe groups will always<br />\nexist, but it is only when<br />\nnewspapers and other media<br />\noutlets join the witch hunt that<br />\nthings start getting dangerous. In<br />\nlast week's editorial, the NewsLetter asserts \"sexism and racism<br />\nhave no place on our campus.\"<br />\nWho judges what is sexist or<br />\nracist and what is not? The NewsLetter! In the 2x +1 controversy,<br />\nthe News-Letter views sexism in<br />\nvery encompassing terms. Where<br />\ndoes the News-Letter draw the<br />\nline? Does every movie shown on<br />\ncampus have to be screened to<br />\nmake sure no scene is derogatory<br />\nto some group? I hope it never<br />\ncomes to this, but the News-Letter<br />\nis on a dangerous road. McCarthy defined liberals, civil libertarians and many others who<br />\ndisagreed with him as Communists. Is everyone who annoys<br />\nthe radical feminists doomed to<br />\nbe labeled as sexist?<br />\nWhen the News-Letter preaches<br />\nabout \"promoting tolerance on<br />\ncampus,\" they should keep in<br />\nmind that censorship of free<br />\nspeech is antithetical to tolerance.<br />\nIt is in this spirit that I encourage<br />\nanyone who disagrees with the<br />\nbasic tenents of this article to respond in next week's News-Letter.<br />\nYou see, everyone is entitled to<br />\ntheir own opinion: even<br />\nMcCarthy ists<br />\nDan Abrams<br /><br />\nEditor's note: At no point did\u2022we<br />\nadvocate the censorship ofeither<br />\nLETTERS, from 6<br /><br />\nVAMOS<br />\nAO<br />\nBRASIL!<br />\nWORK.

Per- hallmark of the intellectual<br />\nsonally, I thought that the Spec- freedom of the Western univertator cartoon was very offensive sity; to deny these rights is to exto the female half of our institu- pose the sanctity of every intion as well as illogical (if dividual's mind to the fiat of those<br />\nHopkins women are so wretched, in power. It is saddening that<br />\nwhy do the great majority have many students here have preciseboyfriends?). Assuming that the ly chosen this alternative to that<br />\nRosen cartoon is racist, then op- of reasoned moral debate which<br />\nprobrium is justified. But these was the original intention of<br />\nare personal opinions and have no higher education.<br />\nplace in mandating what views<br />\nHarry Johnson<br />\nothers must have. I believe that<br />\nthe University Community is<br />\nmaking a large mistake in its calls Cartoon VI<br />\nfor censorship regarding the<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\ncartoons.<br />\nIn regard to the News-Letter's<br />\nI am writing in reference to the<br />\nactions on this matter, the<br />\neditorial board has made the \"2x +1\" cartoon that was printed<br />\ndisturbing proclamation that the in last month's issue of the Specends justify the means. The Feb. tator. Many people have express2 editorial \"Censorship and ed their dissatisfaction with the atEditorship\" tries to escape the titudes expressed in the cartoon<br />\nSee LETTERS, 7<br /><br />\nand have gone further in criticizing the editorial staff for<br />\npublishing the cartoon. In their<br />\nopinion, the cartoon was simply<br />\nin poor taste.<br />\nEach of us on the Spectator<br />\neditorial board fully abhor the atthe<br />\nin<br />\ndepicted<br />\ntitude<br />\ncartoon. The attitude is sexist,<br />\nutterly<br />\nderrogatory, and<br />\nrepulsive. Nevertheless, the attitude does exist on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. One can easily find<br />\nmany instances of male Hopkins<br />\nstudents talking in such a manner.<br />\nMany readers seem to have<br />\nforgotten that this is an editorial<br />\ncartoon, and as such, it is not<br />\nmeant to endorse this attitude.<br />\nAny cartoon, whether it be found<br />\non the editorial page of a<br />\nnewspaper or in the comic section, attempts to take a slice of<br />\nlife and present it under a<br />\nmicroscope for all to see. The<br />\n\"2x +I\" cartoon does exactly<br />\nthis, for it forces us all to confront<br />\nsexism on campus.<br />\nThe cartoon has, therefore,<br />\nsucceeded in its task. It has forced us all\u2014both males and<br />\nfemales\u2014to reevaluate our attitudes toward the opposite sex.<br />\nIt has stimulated discussion of<br />\nsexism; before the cartoon was<br />\npublished, there was very little,<br />\nif any, serious discussion of this<br />\nimportant issue. Open discussion<br />\nof prejudices is always more<br />\nfruitful than the suppression and<br />\nfailure to acknowledge such attitudes. As long as discussion is<br />\noccurring, we are all kept aware<br />\nof the problem of sexist attitudes,<br />\nand we can do something to<br />\nchange them.<br />\nBefore such discussion occurs,<br />\nwe should all become responsible readers and should not<br />\nmisconstrue the cartoonist's intent. As we said before, this was<br />\na cartoon. The two males<br />\ndepicted in it were not intended<br />\nto be people whom we should<br />\nrespect. Instead, they looked silly and repulsing. We all became<br />\nconscious of the sexist attitudes<br />\nthat do exist on campus. As Carl<br />\nPezua wrote in a letter last week,<br />\n\"This comic strip made me<br /><br />\nthink\u2014really think\u2014about the attitudes and sensitivities of<br />\nHopkins students.\" In my opinion, the cartoon fully served its<br />\npurpose.<br />\nSandeep Kishan<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nThe Spectator<br /><br />\nAPL<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing in regard to the article entitled \"APL Tests<br />\nMissiles\" by Mr. Stephen<br />\nMizrach in your issue of<br />\nFebruary 2. I do not wish to<br />\n[dispute] any of the points which<br />\nMr. Mizrach makes in his article,<br />\nbut I do dispute the objectivity of<br />\nhis coverage.<br />\nIt appears from the text of his<br />\narticle that Mr. Mizrach relied<br />\nexclusively on testimony from<br />\nprofessional peace activists (or at<br />\nleast people willing to be described as peace activists). Now, it<br />\nshould be obvious that any peace<br />\nactivist will oppose nuclear<br />\ntesting in any form. At the very<br />\nleast, Mr. Mizrach could have included a statement by someone<br />\nfrom A.P.L.(or, for that matter,<br />\nthe Navy) as to the role of Trident II in protecting America's<br />\nsecurity interests in what he quite<br />\ncorrectly describes as a time<br />\nwhen \"Soviet military response<br />\nis so unpredictable.\"<br />\nThere is no doubt that nuclear<br />\nweapons, in and of themselves,<br />\nare horrible and disturbing things.<br />\nBut they are also a component of<br />\nAmerica's national defense which<br />\nhas negated the threat of world<br />\nwar for over forty years. Only<br />\nafter journalists such as Steve<br />\nMizrach begin to write more<br />\nbalanced articles can the general<br />\nreadership (of this paper or any<br />\nother) become cognizant of the<br />\nbenefits as well as the costs of our<br />\nnation's nuclear capabilities.<br /><br />\nLetters Policy<br /><br />\nCouncil<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs president of the Student<br />\nCouncil I would like to inform<br />\neveryone of two very important<br />\nchanges to the regular functions<br />\nof the Council. First, our weekly meetings for commitee<br />\nbusiness and open discussions<br />\nwill be held in the Shriver Hall<br />\nBoard Room every Wednesday<br />\nevening at 1:00 p.m. unless<br />\notherwise posted. This is one<br />\nhour earlier than before and as<br />\nusual the meetings are open to all<br />\nstudents.<br />\nSecond, the Student Council<br />\noffice has been moved to the first<br />\nfloor of Levering Hall adjacent to<br />\nthe StudeTit Activities Office. For<br />\nthose of you who are't familiar<br />\nwith the location, just make a left<br />\nat the Great Hall and it will be<br />\nthrough the first door on your<br />\nright. Student Council members<br />\nhave office hours from 9:00 a.m.<br />\nto 5:00 p.m. if you have any concerns you would like to address.<br />\nThe office is also the place for all<br />\nelected and student appointed<br />\npositions, such as Orientation,<br />\nM.S.E. Symposium, and Spring<br />\nFair chairs, and Student Council<br />\npositions. The phone number in<br />\nthe office is 338-8203 if there are<br />\nany questions and an answering<br />\nmachine is in effect after hours. I<br />\nI hope that everyone at some<br />\npoint in their time here at<br />\nHopkins will take the opportunity to voice an opinion or concern<br />\non an aspect of student life they<br />\nfeel needs to be improved. The<br />\nStudent Council is just one<br />\nmechanism for that purpose, and<br />\nin order for it to be effective we<br />\nneed as much participation and<br />\ndiversity as is possible. To that<br />\neffect, no one should feel excluded and we will attempt to remain<br />\na visible body for students in the<br />\ntime to come.<br />\nLou Giangiulio<br /><br />\nJames L. T.

McColl<br /><br />\nA tangible bittersweetness coats every frame of<br />\nPaul Mazursky's exceptional \"Enemies, A Love<br />\nStory.\" Although the film can be quickly described as the adventures of a man who is married to<br />\nthree women, some far more grueling machinations are at work here. Herman Broder and his<br />\nwives are Holocaust survivors, part of a select few<br />\nwith permanent, unthinkable stains on their<br />\nmemories.<br />\nBased on an Isaac Bashevis Singer novel,<br />\n\"Enemies\" is such a compelling tale that one<br />\nalmost misses its larger, more insidious themes.<br />\nHerman (Ron Silver) is a struggling writer who<br />\nsurvived the Nazi scourge through the aid of Yadwiga (Margaret Sophie Stein), a Polish peasant<br />\ngirl who sequestered him in her hayloft during the<br />\nwar. Married out of Herman's sense of obligation, they now live together on Coney Island,<br />\nalthough he continues to see camp survivor Masha<br />\n(Lena Olin) on the side.<br />\nHerman's marital responsibilities are laced with<br />\nguilt: when he's about to forget Yadwiga entirely, he hears the barking dogs of the German occupation, and feels the blows that<br />\nYadwiga withstood to preserve their secret. Yadwiga'a link to Herman is both maternal and<br />\nchildlike\u2014she cleans up after him while begging for his approval. Herman can't abandon the<br />\nwoman who saved his life, no matter how unattractive he finds her. And Masha is always there<br />\nto satisfy his obsessive craving for intimacy.<br />\nThe scenes between Masha and Herman are the<br />\nmost revealing in \"Enemies\"; they are convincing expressions of mutual need. The pair make<br />\nlove as if they were the last two people on earth.<br />\nThey have learned to cherish each moment<br />\ntogether since they hardly expected to have any.<br />\nFor the survivors of \"Enemies\" there is no hiding<br />\nin years of psychological bandaging; every emotion is brutally up front. One gets the sense that<br />\nsomething has been carved away against their will,<br />\nand that the healing will begin only after they bring<br />\nanother person as close as is possible.<br />\nWhen Herman promises Masha a Catskills vacation and then waffles at the last minute, she fumes<br /><br />\nThe renovated Albee plays went up this past<br />\nweekend, this year under the name \"Theatre Lab\"<br />\nbecause Edward Albee did not return this year.<br />\nThe intersession course was instead taught by<br />\nmore contemporary names in the theatre world,<br />\nsuch as Tina Howe and Jennifer Warren. The<br />\nchange in personnel was made as the result of<br />\ngeneral dissatisfaction with the course and production of last year's plays. Despite everyone's<br />\nbest efforts and intentions, however, there still remains a great deal of room for improvement.<br />\nTo begin with, the plays were performed in what<br />\nis typically the stage-right section of the audience.<br />\nThis was intriguing at first. Upon entering the<br />\ntheatre, one found the chairs placed on stage for<br />\nthe patrons to sit in, and lighting stands set up in<br />\nvarious parts of the auditorium, (the standard<br />\nlighting was useless in the areas used during the<br />\nperformance).<br />\nAfter the initial wonder wore off, however, the<br />\nrealisms hit. It is my guess that this cut down on<br />\nthe number of available seats, although I could<br />\nnot say for certain; if it did not, it certainly cut<br />\ndown severely on the number of good seats, as<br />\nthe audience's view was obstructed by railings,<br />\nlighting racks, and in some cases, shadows. Other<br />\ninconveniences included the fact that there was<br />\nno miking, so those actors with weaker voices<br />\nwent largely unheard in the sound-proofed room.<br />\nAdditionally, the view of the playing area was difficult to see from the lighting booth, and as such,<br />\nit was necessary for Jennifer Warren to give<br />\nlighting cues from the audience, which was<br />\ndistracting to those sitting around her.<br />\nThe evening's production began with Joshua<br />\nColeman's \"On the Web,\" a play about a<br />\ngentleman returning home from work on the subway who is suddenly accosted by a youth who fancies himself a comic-book hero of sorts. The play<br />\nlargely centers around hi assorted rantings and<br />\nself-discoveries, played convincingly by Jeff Perlstein, who presented a perfect picture of an 80's<br />\n\"young tough,\" though his excessive nervous<br />\nlaughter seemed inconsistent with the character.<br />\nHis movement, which at times drew one away<br />\nfrom his lines, was nonetheless energetic and<br />\nstrong. In fact, Perlstein was able to carry such<br />\nstrength into the play's more difficult lines, as in<br />\na speech on Greek mythology with phrases like<br />\n\"hooves of doom,\" which otherwise might have<br />\nfallen flat. The rest of Spiderman's speeches were<br />\nalso excellent, for that matter, largely due to<br />\nstronger writing.<br />\nIn the background, meanwhile, was Ed Einhorn<br />\nas Sal, the late train's other passenger. At the<br />\nplay's beginning, Einhorn does well with very little, sitting extremely still and shifting his eyes as<br />\nthe youth jumps around him, periodically spitting<br />\nout a line just to pacify the youth. It is when Sal<br />\nneeds to stand on his own that Einhorn falters.<br />\nThis may be due in part to the poor flow of the<br />\nwhole piece\u2014the jumps from exposition to plot<br />\nconflict to other plot conflict, etc., were drastic<br />\nand heavy-handed\u2014but the speech Sal makes<br />\nabout his job is well-written. Unfortunately,<br />\nEinhorn's whiny tone offered comedy where irony<br />\nwas needed.<br />\nThe play's progression from this point is obvious: the boy gets nervous and has a gun, so<br />\nnaturally he must shoot the innocent passenger.<br />\nThe fight scene was poorly acted as well, and quite<br />\nfrankly, I just didn't buy the moment when Spidey<br />\nSee THEATER, 15<br /><br />\nand begins to stalk off. But realization hits her,<br />\nand she turns back to Herman. He sighs and<br />\nshrugs, blinking slowly, as if to say that he's doing the best he can. Masha is the one who solidifies<br />\nthe most powerful moments in \"Enemies.\" Her<br />\nunblinking desire for truth makes her a genuinely tragic figure when the truth finally hits.<br />\nHerman discovers that Tamara (Anjelica<br />\nHuston), his wife from Europe, is alive and living in New York. She has returned from the dead,<br />\nin a sense: she survived burial in a mass grave,<br />\nalthough neither of the couple's children was so<br />\nfortunate. With a bullet still lodged in her hip,<br />\nTamara walks with mock sensuality\u2014she is Herman's safe alternative, the known quantity who<br />\nno longer appeals to him in the same complete way<br />\nshe once did.<br />\nMasha wants to be made an \"honest woman,\"<br />\nand Herman obliges at about the same time that<br />\nYadwiga announces she is pregnant with his child.<br />\nThe idea of three wives has the potential to<br />\ndegenerate quickly into hijinks, but there's no such<br />\ntendency in \"Enemies.\" The film glides on such<br />\na high level that conventional flaws can hardly<br />\nreach it.<br />\nAs things grow tougher for Herman, the<br />\npossibility of leaving it all behind grows increasingly attractive. His three wives are more than just<br />\nmanifestations of a freewheeling libido. He is<br />\nresponding to the God that has turned its back on<br />\nthe Jews. \"There is no God,\" he says to Yadwiga, \"and if there were, I would defy him.\"<br />\n(This drives Yadwiga to tears, since she has converted to Judaism to win his affections.) Despite<br />\nhis flaws, Herman is a convincing and empathetic<br />\ncharacter: there isn't a hint of malice in him.<br />\nThe actors in \"Enemies\u2014 are sensational; they<br />\npractically bleed their belief in the material. Silver<br />\nand his character are a tight fit, and Huston turns<br />\nin another sterling supporting performance. As<br />\nMasha, Lena Olin is simply devastating.<br />\nMazursky and co-writer Roger Simon reveal only brief glimpses of the Nazi horrors that plague<br /><br />\nIn Paul Mazursky's \"Enemies, A Love Story,\"<br />\n(clockwise from top) Ron Silver and Lena Olin;<br />\nAnjelica Huston\u2014outstanding performances.<br />\nthese characters. \"Enemies\" replaces visual cluc<br />\nwith psychological ones, an even more frightening demonstration of the Holocaust's impact on<br />\nits battered survivors.

The DeLas were<br />\nmavericks because they didn't wear sweat suits<br />\n(though they had funny names) and their attitude<br />\nwas decidedly mellow.

On<br />\ncuts like \"Acknowledge Your Own History,\" \"J.<br />\nBeez Comin' Through,\" and \"Tribe Vibes,\" the<br />\nJungle Brothers alternately identify with and update their ancestry, and they invite all takers to<br />\ndo the same. Their message is clear: they \"Forsee<br />\na future of Unity/U and I you and me.\"<br />\nLike Soul II Soul, the Jungle Brothers also<br />\nrecognize the primal and redemptive powers of<br />\ndance, and the frequent chants and exhortations<br />\nhere to move one's body are not mindless hypes,<br />\nbut genuine calls for congress on the dance floor.<br />\n(\"No matter what size, shape, or color/We can<br />\njam and enjoy each other.\") It's a starkly unified<br />\nlyrical vision, and the music backs it with a sleek,<br />\nuncluttered sound that recalls the early output of<br />\nTommy Boy Records (as well as the hard grooves<br />\nof the Furious Flames). The much-funky \"Feelin'<br />\nAlright\" and \u2014 U' Make Me Sweat\" should convince all non-believers.<br />\nQueen Latifah, meanwhile, has assembled an<br />\nimpressive panoply of styles\u2014from rap to dancehall to house music\u2014and mixed them with some<br /><br />\nattitude, with \"All Hail the Queen\" the result.<br />\nThe album's first single, \"Dance for Me,\" was<br />\none of last year's hip-hop rages, and this LP is<br />\nbrimming with similar treats. Backed by D.J.<br />\nMark the 45 King (who is also perhaps the rap<br />\nproducer of the year), \"All Hail the Queen\"<br />\nboasts the guest talents of De La Soul, Stetasonic's<br />\nDaddy-0, KRS-One, and Monie Love, as well as<br />\na lyrical outlook similar to the Jungle Brothers'.<br />\nA lot of the raps on \"All Hail the Queen\" offer Latifah the chance to put down racism,<br />\nviolence, and sexism; or to play sly, posturing<br />\ncharacters, as on the goofy \"Mama Gave Birth<br />\nto the Soul Children.\" Latifah speaks righteously, and when the mix starts to match her beat with<br />\nsampled sound from Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix, and<br />\neven The The, it's a genuine privilege to be a part<br />\nof her queendom.<br />\nGraham Parker\u2014Human Soul(RCA)<br />\nDespite Graham Parker's demonstrated<br />\nsongwriting ability, there's something oddly unsatisfying about \"Human Soul.\" Certain songs<br />\nare superb, as strong as anything of their kind.(4.<br />\nspecial mention should go to \"Daddy's A<br />\nPostman,\" a truly hilarous look at the postcardperfect American family.) Parker's political stance<br />\nis commendable, as well, though he has jumped<br />\non the bandwagon with \"Slash and Burn,\" his version of the requisite save-the-rainforest song that's<br />\nseems destined to show up in some form on every<br />\nalbum this year.<br />\nSo what's wrong here? A few years ago, this<br />\nmight have been a groundbreaking record. But the<br />\nnagging feeling that \"Human Soul\" generates,<br />\nespecially after two or three listenings, is that this<br />\nis all-too-familiar territory. Parker clearly owes<br />\na great deal to Elvis Costello; besides their similar<br />\nvoices, Parker's production style (even his inconsistency) is reminiscent of Elvis's.

The<br />\nmembers of the group remain<br />\nloyal to a protean, occasionally !oopy repertoire (several hundred songs strong) and, as their<br />\nJanuary 30 performance at<br />\nHammerjack's made clear, they<br />\nplay it with a peerless rapport.<br />\nNot that they flaunt it: The<br />\nprimary concern at the Hammerjack's show was, as always<br />\nwith NRBQ, entertainment.<br />\nThe group ripped through one<br />\nrafter-shaking tune after another<br />\n(\"Crazy Like a Fox,\" \"Get<br />\nRhythm,\" \"12 Bar Blues\") and<br />\nonly rarely came up for air, as<br />\nin guitarist Al Anderson's<br /><br />\nearnest rendition of \"Make<br />\nLove Not War\" early in the<br />\nfirst set.<br />\nYet even the poor sound<br />\nsystem and the dense, raucous<br />\ncrowd could not mask the<br />\nband's remarkable musicianship.

Barbara Stanwyck<br />\nfirst played the doting and<br />\nanguished Stella Claire in 1939,<br />\nin a film (and a performance) that<br />\nmany now consider a classic. Yet<br />\nfrom the evidence of the new<br />\n\"Stella,\" one is led to suspect<br />\nthat both Erman and Midler were<br />\nprepared to ride on the coattails<br />\nof the earlier film.<br />\nThe choppy storyline begins as<br />\nStella is made pregnant by a<br />\nyoung medical student (Stephen<br />\nCollins), who agrees to do the<br />\nright thing and marry her. She<br />\nelects to raise the child herself,<br /><br />\nhowever, and after Jenny is born,<br />\nStella's main objective in life appears to be making her happy.<br />\nYet the spectre of father always<br />\nlingers. Jenny meets her wellsituated father repeatedly over the<br />\nyears (illustrated in a time-elapsed<br />\nseries of ice cream sundae lunches) and grows up before the audience's eyes. Although Jenny is<br />\nliving under her mother's roof,<br />\nthe film glosses over roughly a<br />\ndozen years of her life (in the<br />\naforementioned scene) with next<br />\nto no mention of Stella. Whatever<br />\ninsight we might gain from seeing them \"grow up\" together is<br />\nblacked out.<br />\nEven in Jenny's early years<br />\n(presumably before she started<br />\ngoing out for ice cream), the rap-<br /><br />\nport between she and Stella seems<br />\ncliched. Though Stella's love may<br />\nindeed be perdurable and genuine, it comes across as nothing<br />\nspecial: Stella brushes Jenny's<br />\nhair, puts on her pretty dresses<br />\nand Mary Jane shoes, etc.<br />\nWhen Jenny grows up, she no<br />\nlonger seems very appealing. The<br />\nadolescent<br />\nJenny<br />\n(Trini<br />\nAlvarado) spends most of her<br />\ntime looking physically exhausted, and she certainly isn't<br />\nvery lovable\u2014a quality that<br />\nwould make Stella's crude,<br />\ndown-home affections at least<br />\nplausible, if not necessarily likely.

Meanwhile, Adams<br />\njumped onto the drum riser and<br />\nbegan banging gleefully on Ardolino's kit, against the beat.<br />\nThis sort of excursion into<br />\ncraziness has made NRBQ's<br />\nlive performances legendary.<br />\nCoupled with the band's<br />\nrefreshing approach to concert<br />\nprogramming\u2014Adams chooses<br />\nthe evening's program sponat<br />\neach<br />\ntaneously<br />\nperformance\u2014it brings both excitement and a chance of col-<br /><br />\nlapse to every NRBQ show.<br />\nThe Hammerjack's performance witnessed a little of both.<br />\nAlthough \"White Christmas\"<br />\nwas zanily inspired, some of<br />\nAdams' other choices at show's<br />\nend (\"Green Lights,\" \"Ridin'<br />\nin My Car\") seemed too conventional, lacking in nerve. One<br />\nof the band's agile, complex instrumentals would have been a<br />\nwelcome substitute.<br />\nDespite the loss of steam at<br />\nthe end, the band's set and two<br />\nencores were clean, energetic,<br />\nand deceptively nuanced. Part<br />\nof NRBQ's appeal is the apparent ease with which they<br />\ntackle so many musical idioms;<br />\nnothing seems beyond the<br />\nplayers' technical or emotional<br />\nrange. Unfortunately, that<br /><br />\nmutable quality has also been a<br />\nparty to the Quartet's commercial demise; one suspects that<br />\nradio programmers (and many<br />\npotential fans) simply don't<br />\nknow what to make of their eccentric musical aesthetic.<br />\nAs their performances and<br />\ntheir records attest, however,<br />\nthe New Rhythm and Blues<br />\nQuartet isn't eager to be<br />\npigeonholed artistically. The<br />\ngroup has survived two decades<br />\nwithout serious threat to its<br />\nschizophrenic Muse, and loyal<br />\nlisteners have reaped the<br />\nbenefits.

Wealthy John<br />\n(of upstate New York) and<br />\ncosmetic-toting Stella (of upper<br />\nmiddle Nowheresville) face off<br />\nfor their daughter's lovetorn affections. Curiously, there isn't an<br />\nounce of tension in these scenes:<br />\nBoth parents are so accomodating<br />\nto Jenny that they come across as<br />\nmerely bland and uncommitted.<br />\nThe filmmakers, unfortunately, are committed in a different<br />\nway. Throughout \"Stella\" there<br />\nare constant (and not very subtle)<br />\nshifts of contrast, from Stella's<br />\nsparse furniture and clothes to the<br />\npomp and elegance of the father's<br />\nsurroundings. The carrot has<br />\nbeen mounted on the stick for<br />\nJenny, one would assume, but<br />\n\"Stella\" tries repeatedly to lure<br />\nthe au6ience into its materialist<br />\nmindset. It's difficult not to feel<br />\nfor Stella: not only is she poor<br />\nand in danger of losing her<br />\ndaughter, her own film is against<br />\nher, as well.<br />\nAt the same time, Midler often<br />\ncomes close to swallowing the entire picture with her presence.<br />\nStella Claire is a jewel of a role,<br />\nand Midler knows it. In her<br /><br />\neuphoria to play it faithfully, she<br />\npractically strangles the character<br />\nto death. She is constantly talking too loudly, slamming doors,<br />\njumping onto bars, and the like,<br />\nthreatening at times to swamp the<br />\nentire picture.<br />\nThis is compounded by director John Erman's weighty<br />\ndramatic atmosphere, which<br />\nseeks to add emotional intensity<br />\nwhere none is necessary or even<br />\npossible. When Stella decides to<br />\nhave her child alone, early in the<br />\nfilm, the audience is supposed to<br />\naccept her decision as fatalistic:<br />\nStella is destined to have an arduous, unfulfilling life. The hitch<br />\nis, if you don't buy Midler's<br />\nposturing\u2014Erman<br />\ntries<br />\ndesperately to ensure that you<br />\ndo\u2014the rest of \"Stella\" is utterly predictable.<br />\nDespite all this, however,<br /><br />\nMidler is perfectly cast. It's a<br />\ntestimony to her ability that she<br />\nnavigates Robert Getchell's<br />\ntiresome screenplay so adroitly.<br />\nHer Stella is loud, brash, and unself-conscious, so much so that<br />\nshe all but eclipses the other performances in the film.(Even Erman seems intimidated by her<br />\npresence, choosing to shoot her<br />\nat a distance rather than in<br />\nclose-up.)<br />\nIt remains clear, even after<br />\nMidler has blazed across the<br />\nscreen and the credits have rolled, that somewhere in \"Stella\"<br />\nlies a great story. Not a great<br />\nscript, necessarily, but a story.<br />\nThe latest version of \"Stella\"<br />\nsuggests that Erman and Midler<br />\nthought so, too, but that they expected the story to do their dirty<br />\nwork for them.<br /><br />\nSTELLA<br />\nDirected by John Erman<br />\nScreenplay by Robert Getchell<br />\nBased on a novel by Olive Higgins Prouty<br />\nProduced by Samuel Goldwyn Jr.<br />\nDirector of Photography Billy Williams, B.S.C.<br /><br />\nTheatre Lab's Highs and Lows<br />\nTHEATER, from 14<br />\ncomes back to hug Sal's body; it was corny and<br />\nfelt like a hammer pounding in a message.<br />\nNext came the first of the evening's four<br />\nmonologues, \"Body Parts,\" which was written<br />\nby Andrew Bragen (also actor in the show). The<br />\nmonologue focused on a grandmother reminiscing on her late husband and their experiences in<br />\ngrowing old. But in the short time it went on, it<br />\nexplored the fear of technology, sex after sixty,<br />\nromance, antagonism in marriage, fear of<br />\nlonliness, and a host of other subjects. Bragen's<br />\nwriting is bright, funny, and strong, and Nancy<br />\nWerner's performance as Eula was nothing less<br />\nthan endearing. She did little more than sit in a<br />\nrocking chair and point her finger to Heaven, but<br />\nher voice was all she really needed. It made \"Body<br />\nParts\" the best part of the evening.<br />\nThen came another monologue, \"Rhiannon's<br />\nBane,\" written by Douglas Barre, also an actor,<br />\nand performed by Robin Brillante. The segment<br />\nconcerned a teenager making a trip to the free<br />\nclinic for the obvious and her explanation to the<br />\ninvisible doctor (receptionist? nurse?) about why<br /><br />\nshe is taking the step that she is. Perhaps it's just<br />\nthat it is a man writing about a woman's anxiety<br />\nbefore an abortion, perhaps not, but this just didn't<br />\nwork well at all, particularly in the wake of<br />\nsomething as fresh as \"Body Parts.\"<br />\nThe idea is hackneyed, and Barre handles it<br />\nvaguely. After all, this woman is planning to have<br />\nan abortion, yet she tells a story (again from Greek<br />\nmythology) about a goddess punished for killing<br />\nher baby, then says that she didn't want to feel<br />\nlike she was killing hers. Confusing. Even given<br />\nthat poetic license, however, neither Barre's<br />\nwriting nor Brillante's performance convinced me<br />\nthat this character would delve deeply into Greek<br />\nmythology to explain her own pregnancy.<br />\nThe segment did have one terrific aspect,<br />\nhowever: Brillante's face. For whatever her words<br />\nlacked, her face supplied: a wrinkled brow and<br />\npursed smirk for naive confusion, a slight tilt for<br />\nshame or embarrassment. While these devices<br />\ncouldn't always drag the writing up onto a higher<br />\nlevel, her expressions, at least, stood far enough<br />\nabove the text to be noteworthy.<br />\nSee THEATER, 16<br /><br />\nOPEN HOUSE<br />\nWEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1990 3:00-5:00 PM<br />\nREFRESHMENTS IN THE HOMEWOOD MAIN LOBBY &amp; MCCOY SOCIAL LOUNGE<br />\nSTUDENT HOUSING TOURS OF THE BALTIMOREAN, HOMEWOOD, AND MCCOY APARTMENTS<br /><br />\nntis,<br /><br />\nAiti\"0<br />\n\u2022gr.,ao<br />\nt.<br /><br />\nLottery information session<br />\nTuesday, March 6 at 7:00<br />\np.m. Multi-purpose room\u2014<br />\nAMR I<br /><br />\n1988 Creative Mt<br /><br />\ncervices<br /><br />\n\"HAVING CHOICES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH FINDING A COMFORTABLE FIT.\"<br />\nThe Housing Office Staff invites you to participate in the OPEN HOUSE festivities!!<br />\nk<br /><br />\n16/FEBRUARY 9, 1990<br /><br />\nTHEATER<br /><br />\nTheatre Lab's Highs and Lows<br />\nTHEATER, from 15<br />\nThen came \"Volunteers,\" David Dudley's play<br />\nabout three men in a government drug testing experiment. Douglas Barre played the neophyte<br />\nGreen to comic excellence, hitting all the whines<br />\njust right, but rarely letting them go too far, prodding the other two men (Red in particular) just<br />\nthe right amount. Andrew Bragen played the<br />\nworldly irate Red, whose main goal seemed to be<br />\ngetting free food, a free place to stay, and his<br />\nmoney. While the role was small, Bragen filled<br />\nit well, turning otherwise gratuitous cursing into<br />\neffective punctuation in the scenes. Unfortunately, the character itself was the weakest of the three,<br />\nserving as the explainer and mediator of the other<br />\ntwo.<br />\nBut when Blue (Josh Coleman) entered in the<br />\nfirst scene, it was as if electricity were suddenly<br />\npumped onto the stage. He wore his character like<br />\nmost people wear an old coat\u2014he was comfortable, and knew exactly how to wear it to make<br />\nit look good. You really believed that he was<br />\nbrain-fried from too many previous experiments.<br />\nWhile most actors would use nervous tics to flush<br />\nout a character, Coleman used them as explanations of his own. His tapping fingers and rubbing<br />\nhands were expressions both of drug abuse and<br />\nof fear\u2014fear of going outside, fear of staying in,<br />\nand fear of the power of the other two men over<br />\nhim, for if anyone leaves or loses control of<br />\nhimself, we were told, the experiment is off.<br />\nThe three worked together beautifully, so well<br />\nin fact that it became tough to say if it was good<br />\nacting or good writing or both. Green and Red<br />\nseemed to rely on Blue for information, and Blue<br />\non them as well, though the audience was never<br />\ntold what for. By the third scene, the audience<br />\nknew that they'd been cooped up in that room for<br />\nthree weeks, watching the same movies, building<br />\nforced comradery, eating Twinkies, smoking<br />\ndope, and getting on each others' nerves. In one<br />\nscene, Green badgered Red by counting randomly while Red did sit-ups. Red lost count of how<br />\nmany he'd done, and nearly punched Green until<br />\nBlue reminded him of the violence clause in the<br />\nexperiment agreement. Later in the same scene,<br />\nhowever, in a beautifully comic reprisal, Green<br />\nbegan banging his head against the wall in frusration, and Red, realizing that the experiment and<br />\nhis paycheck would be cancelled, began counting<br />\nrandomly, hoping Green would lose track of how<br />\nmany times he had hit himself.<br />\nUnfortunately, Dudley needed maybe one more<br />\nscene to pull off the ending. When Blue slammed<br />\nhis way out of the experiment, it felt as though<br />\nthe tables had turned too quickly and too obviously<br /><br />\nfor a play of this intelligence. Something is missing, and while the ending works, given what<br />\npreceded it, it could work better.<br />\nAfter intermission, Elin Hilderbrand came out<br />\nand performed Salvatore Zannino's \"Pageant.' In<br />\nit, Aria Alexander is about to go out for the evening wear segment of a beauty pageant and in an<br />\nespecially inane speech, she comments on her<br />\nlooks in a mirror. Hildebrand had only 45 seconds<br />\nto save herself from the mire of the writing and<br />\nthe hurried miming of make-up application, and<br />\nunfortunately, it just wasn't enough time. She was<br />\nforced to deliver lines that begin with \"Oh, Lynda Carter,\" and \"Oh, Liz Taylor\" and ended by<br />\ninsulting these actresses in ways that were neither<br />\nclever nor poignant in terms of her character. The<br />\npiece had no apparent purpose, except to waste<br />\nHilderbrand's considerable talent.<br />\nThe fourth and final monologue, \"American<br />\nGeisha,\" was written and performed by Kerry<br />\nTesoriero. It concerned a stock person at a clothing<br />\nstore as she (rather amorously) considered a<br />\nfemale co-worker. Tesoriero swayed and stared<br />\nand spoke deeply, offering an erotic tension so<br />\nintense that I thought the two women were<br />\nhomosexual. The writing was tremendous, and the<br />\nimages Tesoriero created accentuated the tones she<br />\nestablished, one such image being the \"faux-lizard<br />\nsling-gack pumps, green\" that surfaced at just the<br />\nright moments. Toward the end, however,<br />\nTesoriero introduces the co-worker's boyfriend\u2014<br />\nare these merely voiced mental musings? Still, as<br />\nin the case of \"Volunteers,\" strong acting<br />\nthroughout, and strong writing that paled towards<br />\nthe end.<br />\nThe final piece of the evening was Nathan Potter's \"Rubber Bullets.\" Jason Katz played Alex,<br />\na cleaning man who works in a bar owned by an<br />\nalcoholic, wife-beating jerk named Dennis (Carl<br />\nLarkin). Alex is friendly with the bartender, Lenny<br />\n(Raymond Parungoa), who offers advice on Alex's<br />\naffections for Dennis's wife, Cara. Alex is essentially a milquetoast who lets himself be bullied,<br />\nhumors himself, and tries to humor others by offering artistic criticism on Martin Scorcese's film<br />\n\"Taxi Driver\" (based on notes no doubt taken<br />\nin Linda Benn's film class last semester). When<br />\nAlex manages to get a gun away from a mugger<br />\n(the second one he has encountered that day), he<br />\nbecomes filled with delusions of changing his life<br />\nby killing Dennis and stealing Cara away. In the<br />\nend of course, he can't go through with it, and<br />\nthe play ends largely the way it begins.<br />\nJason Katz truimphs over very difficult material<br />\nin this play, giving a depth to his character that<br />\nis lacking in the other three performers. He<br /><br />\nGOLD RING SALE<br />\n$75 OFF 18K<br />\n$50 OFF 14K<br />\n$ 5 OFF 10K<br /><br />\nmanages to make even the most awkward scenes<br />\nwork as best they might(including Alex's impersonation of Robert DeNiro's psychotic<br />\nconfrontation with his mirror in Taxi Driver).<br />\nRaymond Parungao also does an admirable job<br />\nwith his material as Lenny, but unfortunately, he<br />\njust doesn't deliver the amount of realism that Katz<br />\ndoes\u2014some of his lines are just too unreal to be<br />\ndelivered well. Carl Latkin as the abusive, weighttrained Dennis moved too stiffly and spoke too<br />\ndeliberately to be intimidating, but moreover his<br />\ncharacter was just inconsistent, though this is a<br />\nflaw in the writing. For example, told that his wife<br />\nhas cheated on him, why doesn't he beat her<br />\nsoundly when he has the chance? We are told he<br />\nhas done this before, for less of a reason. Julia<br />\nRo's character suffers from many of the same<br />\nproblems\u2014if she is so rational and determined to<br />\nstay with her husband, why does his display of<br />\nuncaring send her to Alex's apartment? And if she<br />\nisn't intelligent enough to have left her husband<br />\nor to get help for him, or to understand Alex's<br />\ncomments on the movie, then how is she able to<br />\nfigure out Alex's scheme\u2014even Lenny isn't that<br />\nbad a liar. She knows that killing is crazy, but<br />\ndoesn't realize cheating on her physically abusive<br />\nhusband is crazy. Unfortunately, these inconsistencies proved to be too much for Ro who was<br />\nbelievable scene to scene, but not as a whole<br />\ncharacter.<br />\nBut the root of the problems with the acting stem<br />\nfrom the play itself. Apart from the inconsistent<br /><br />\ncharacters mentioned above and the obviously<br />\nplagarized elements from Taxi Driver, the movement of the play just doesn't work. Potter<br />\nestablishes such extreme characters at the beginning of the play that he has nowhere to take them<br />\nbut to mediocrity. Alex is so spineless that the gun<br />\nmight have the legitimate ability to send him over<br />\nthe deep end and kill Dennis, but he doesn't. Dennis is so self-centered and ill-tempered that realizing that Alex has cuckolded him would be enough<br />\nreason for him to kill Alex when he gets the chance.<br />\nBut he doesn't. And the scene ot the two men<br />\nabout to kill each other playing with a real gun<br />\nshould be enough to make even someone as<br />\nunintelligent as Cara realize that the two men are<br />\ndangerous, but it doesn't. On top of which is the,.<br />\nquestion of the gun itself. One of the first things<br />\na writer is told is an old adage by Chekov, which<br />\nstates, \"if you put a gun on the wall in Act I, you'd<br />\nbetter have used it by Act V.\" Potter sets himself<br />\nup with a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't<br />\nsituation. If Alex does kill Dennis, or vice-versa,<br />\nthen that's too obvious. But because the gun never<br />\ngets used, the audience is left feeling unfulfilled,<br />\nas though they have just watched nothing change.<br />\nThe intersession program did an admirable job<br />\nin the time they had to work in. But the limitation of time, added to the already disorienting notion of not performing on stage may have proven<br />\nto be too much, for, in many cases, they seemed<br />\nto fall short of polished work.<br /><br />\nRECORDS<br />\nRECORDS, from 14<br />\narrangements were deranged as their lyrics, relying upon insane combinations of saxophone,<br />\naccordian, and almost any other instrument<br />\nimaginable.

For those individuals<br />\nwho have made the decisions to be sexually active, the best protection is consistent use of condoms in conjunction with spermicidal<br />\nfoam, jellies, or creams.<br />\nIn the 1990's, the sexually transmitted disease that will make the<br />\nfront page of \"Time\" magazine and dominate the science sections<br />\nof newspapers is that caused by the Human Papilloma Virus. As with<br />\nother sexuallly transmitted diseases, infection rates are highest among<br />\nadolescents and college students. A study done at the University of<br />\nWashington (Seattle) showed that 17 percent of sexuallly active<br />\nwomen were infected with HPV. At Hopkins, approximately ten percent of students have some evidence of HPV infection.<br />\nThere are over 50 strains of this virus. Some strains typically cause<br />\nwarts on the skin. Other strains cause warts to develop anywhere<br />\non or in the male or female genital tract. Warts may develop on the<br />\npenis or scrotum or on the vulva, in the vagina or on the cervix.<br />\nBoth males and females can develop warts around the anus even if<br />\nthey do not engage in anal intercourse. Visible warts usually develop<br />\nin two-thirds of individuals who have intercourse with an infected<br />\npartner. The time from infection to the appearance of visible warts<br /><br />\nby Alan Joffe<br />\nMedical Director, Student Health Clinic<br />\nThe two most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases on college<br />\ncampuses today, Johns Hopkins University included, are Chlamydia<br />\nTrachomatis and Human Papillorna Virus (HPV). Over the last<br />\ndecade, the symptoms, complications and treatment for chlamidial<br />\ninfections have been well delineated. For HPV infection, optimum<br />\nidentification and treatment strategies have only begun to emerge.<br />\nChlamydia Trachomatis is an organism that can only live within<br />\ncells of the body. It most commonly infects genital tract cells but<br />\ncan infect other areas as well. Approximately ten percent of sexually active college students get this infection; nationwide, infection rates<br />\nare highest among people 15-24 years of age.<br />\nSymptoms of infection usually develop within two weeks of exposure to this organism. Among males, the urethra is most commonly<br />\ninvolved. Typically, students complain of discharge from the penis<br />\nand/or burning when they urinate. However, many infected males<br />\nmay have no symptoms whatsoever yet are still capable of transmitting the infection to their partner.<br />\nFor females, the most common site of infection is the cervix; women<br />\nmay seek treatment for a vaginal discharge. However, since this<br />\norganism can also infect the urethra, a woman may experience burning when she urinates. This symptom is also experienced by women<br /><br />\nJohn /Asa<br /><br />\nSorry...it takes more than a \"Fiesta\" colored condom to impress this<br />\nNineties woman. But, your sensitivity and knowledge of safer sex is<br />\ndefinitely appreciated.<br /><br />\nwith a bladder infection; hence, women who seek treatment at the<br />\nStudent Health Clinic for a presumed bladder infection are often<br />\nqueried about and evaluated for the possibility of infection with<br />\nchlamydia. Again, many women with Chlamydia Trachomatis infections lack any symptoms; consequently, routine screening for this<br />\norganism is a regular part of annual gynecologic exams at the Clinic.<br />\nEven though the symptoms of this infection are often mild or even<br />\nnonexistent, the consequences of untreated infections can be<br />\ndevastating, especially for women. This organism can gain access<br />\nto the uterus and fallopian tubes, setting up an intense inflammation<br />\nthat can result in scarring which leads to infertility and/or an increased<br />\nrisk for ectopic pregnancy (an abnormal pregnancy in which the fertilized egg grows in the fallopian tube rather than the uterus.) Fortunately, ther are several inexpensive tests that can identify individuals<br />\neven if thay have no symptoms. All of these techniques are available<br />\nthrough the Student Health Clinic.<br />\nOnce an infection is detected, treatment is relatively simple. A student need only take doxycycline, tetracycline, or erythromycin for<br />\nseven to ten days. Successful treatment, and limitation of spread of<br />\nthis organism, requires notification of all recent sex partners. Unfortunately, infection does not confer immunity: one can be infected<br />\nwith chlamydia as often as one is exposed to a partner with this infection. Many individuals erroneously believe that use of birth control pills protects against chlamydia infection. In fact, use of the pill<br /><br />\nATTENTION<br />\nAll Sophomores<br />\nand<br />\nJuniors:<br />\nApplications for Community<br />\nAssistants and Student<br />\nAssistants are now available<br />\nfrom the Residential Life<br />\nOffice, Housing Office, and<br />\n1-G Wolman.<br /><br />\nDeadline for applications is<br />\nFebruary 23 (Friday).<br /><br />\nSee CONDOM, 19<br /><br />\nJohn Misa<br /><br />\nJay contemplates...\"Sex?

However, recent research has established a link<br />\nbetween HPV infection and the development of cancer of the cervix<br />\nin women. This is not to say that any woman with genital warts will<br />\ndevelop cervical cancer. Rather, sexually active women with HPV<br />\ninfection appear to be at higher risk for developing cervical cancer<br />\nthan sexually active women who do not have such an infection. The<br />\nmagnitude and nature of the risk has yet to be worked out. A piece<br />\nof the puzzle appears to be that certain strains of HPV that cause<br />\ngenital warts have the capability of transforming normal cells into<br />\ncancerous cells whereas other strains of genital HPV do not. It is<br />\nalso likely that other factors\u2014as yet unidentified\u2014play a role.<br />\nAny male who has any concerns that he has genital warts should<br />\nseek care at the Student Health Clinic. Those who have been told<br />\nby their sex partners that they are infected should seek care even<br />\nif they personally cannot detect any warts.<br />\nWe make this recommendation because many males may have infection that can only be detected through use of a magnifying glass<br />\nand a vinegar wash.<br />\nFifty to sixty percent of women with warts on their external genitalia<br />\nwill also have cervical infection. However, only three to six percent<br />\nof women with cervical HPV infection will have external genital<br />\nwarts. Hence, use of a PAP smear as a regular component of the<br />\nannual gynecologic exam has become more critical than ever. The<br />\nmost common cause of a persistently abnormal PAP smear among<br />\ncollege women is the presence of HPV infection. Hence, women<br />\nwhose PAP smears remain abnormal even after they receive treatment for other sexually transmitted diseases, will likely require further evaluation, usually by a gynecologist at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital. This is because physicians who look at PAP smears cannot readily distinguish between changes associated with HPV infection and those seen in early cervical cancer.<br />\nTreatment of external genital warts usually consists of applications<br />\nof a resin called podophyllin or liquid nitrogen. Depending on the<br />\nsize of the wart, six or seven treatments, one week apart, are often<br />\nneeded. Warts in the vagina or penis or on the cervix require more<br />\nspecialized treatment, usually by a gynecologist or urologist. Because<br />\nthe DNA from the wart virus can be incorporated into normal human<br />\ncells, HPV infections can persist and be very difficult to treat. Since<br />\ninfection with one strain does not confer immunity against other<br />\nstrains, one can be infected multiple times. It also appears that one<br />\ncan be reinfected with the same strain even after successful treatment. As with any sexually transmitted infection, notification and<br />\ntreatment of sex partners is critical.<br />\nHow do you protect yourself against infection? Again, condoms<br />\nused with spermicides offer the best protection. Condoms offer a<br />\nmechanical barrier of protection while the active ingredient in spermicides (nonxyno1-9) appears capable of killing the wart virus. Use<br />\nof condoms will also decrease your risk of getting AIDS. In many<br />\nparts of the world, condoms are the primary means of contraception; among the Japanese, almost two-thirds of sexually active males<br />\nregularly use condoms. If we are to stem the \u2022 epidemic of sexually<br />\ntransmitted diseases in the United States, we need to follow their lead.<br /><br />\nHILLCREST CLINIC<br />\nPrompt confidential help<br />\n\u2022 FREE PREGNANCY TESTING<br />\n\u2022 ABORTION SERVICES<br />\n\u2022 BIRTH CONTROL SERVICES<br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br /><br />\n788-44001<br /><br />\n\u2022 SONOGRAMS<br />\n\u2022 COUNSELING<br />\n\u2022 COMMUNITY EDUCATION<br /><br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n830 500pm<br /><br />\n:7An<br /><br />\n5602 Baltimore National Pike *600<br /><br />\nthatiumot\u00b1)0nm:1-Au f:<br />\nomit*<br />\ntta ,1591.6DX*(n)*1990*(i L&lt; 11,<br /><br />\n%3Eil<br />\ntJ14<br /><br />\n1991*5E*()*7<br /><br />\nOR*4.1.`i/S -C\n<br />\n\u2022 rzIs8s500s -clottfk0ittit s<br />\nebalca5tr_TOa..* roc*TElitfrO)41-1)(<br />\nto<br />\n\":16!gillitclVilkoDialt,<br />\ni!),<br />\nLiair6OgglifficillatIS10Ye.

Hopkins began<br />\nFebruary trailing second-place<br />\nWidener by one game in the<br />\nMAC Southeastern Division and<br />\nfacing a tough league foe, Ursinus, on the road. Coach Bill<br />\nNelson was asked before the<br />\ngame whether Hopkins was<br />\nfavored to win. \"Are you kidding? They beat us down here fat<br />\nHopkins] last time!\" Had Nelson<br />\nknown that his leading scorer,<br />\nAndy Enfield, would be held to<br />\neleven points, he would have<br />\nbeen even more concerned than<br />\ncoaches usually are in such situations. The Jays came through,<br />\nhowever, to beat Ursinus 75-72<br />\nwith a balanced offensive attack,<br />\nsetting up a showdown for second<br />\nwith Widener.<br />\nThe Widener game began with<br />\na strong defensive effort and a<br />\nprecisely run offense. Unfortunately for Hopkins, both were<br />\nput forth by Widener, who quickly went up 10-0. A Dick Vitalelike feeling emanated throughout<br />\nthe arena: Get a T.O., baby\u2014<br />\nwhich Nelson did to try to help<br />\nthe Jays figure out how to break<br />\nWidener's zone defense.<br />\nThe results, however, were<br />\nsimilar to those reaped if a boxer switched from a traditional<br />\nright-handed stance to southpaw<br />\nin attempting to outpoint Mike<br />\nTyson. By the time the half ended, the Jays were down 30-13. To<br />\nsay they were struggling on offense would be quite an<br />\nunderstatement.<br /><br />\nWidener came in with a simple but calculated game plan to<br />\nstop Hopkins and proceeded to<br />\nexecute it to perfection. On offense, they played a slow-down<br />\ngame, running the 45-second shot<br />\nclock down to 10 practically<br />\nevery offensive trip. At that moment, the Widener coach would<br />\nyell \"Ten!\" and one of the<br />\nWidener guards would look to<br />\ndrive and create. Amazingly,<br />\nWidener was able to get good<br />\nshots off, even with the shot clock<br />\nrunning down, and finished the<br />\ngame 23-for-44 for 52 percent.<br />\nOn defense they played a zone<br />\nthat extended out to the threepoint circle and retracted back into the lane with astonishing<br />\ncelerity. The Jays tried their usual<br />\nzone-breaking scheme by putting<br />\nEnfield and Jay Gangemi just outside the three-point circle, and<br />\nBill Zahn on the baseline. Zahn,<br />\nhowever, wasn't able to connect<br />\non his first three attempts from<br />\nthat location and the Widener<br />\nguards and forwards were very<br />\nquick to jump out on Enfield<br />\nwhenever he touched the ball.<br />\nThis occasionally left Gangemi<br />\nopen, who had hit 46 percent of<br />\nhis three-pointers on the season.<br />\nBut this wasn't to be his night,<br />\nunless there were recent job<br />\nopenings in the bricklaying industry, as Gangemi was only able<br />\nto connect on three of twelve<br />\ntreys and three of fourteen shots<br />\noverall, finishing with nine<br />\npoints. The rest of the Jays'<br />\nregulars got similar results,<br />\nhoisting up 34 shots and connecting on only 12.<br />\nWidener's zone was also effective in keeping Hopkins off the<br /><br />\nOne Fan's View:<br /><br />\nIn defense of an<br />\nunappreciated art<br /><br />\nboards, as three or four Jays were<br />\nusually on the perimeter when<br />\nshots were attempted. The basic<br />\nproblem, though, was Hopkins'<br />\nlack of a third outside shooter to<br />\nbreak the zone. With point guard<br />\nDave Eikenberg, whose main<br />\njobs are to play tough defense,<br />\nrun the offense, and distribute the<br />\nball, at the top of the key,<br />\nWidener's guards were able to<br />\nleave him open for the most part<br />\nand key on Enfield. In this instance Eikenberg's unwillingness<br />\nto launch the three-pointer seemed to limit Hopkins' attack. In addition, Eikenberg had an uncharacteristic five turnovers and<br />\nonly three assists. Hopkins was<br />\nalso unable to get the ball inside<br />\nthe zone either by inlet passes or<br />\npenetration. On several occasions<br />\nEikenberg was able to penetrate,<br />\nbut rather than breaking down the<br />\ndefense he found himself surrounded by Widener players with<br />\nno one to pass the ball to.<br />\nHopkins was able to cut the<br />\nlead to single digits after<br />\nGangemi connected on three treys<br />\nearly in the second half, but the<br />\nJays were never able to seriously threaten Widener after that,<br />\nlosing by the final score of 60-50.<br />\nEnfield was unable to get untracked, finishing with 10 points<br />\n(which led the team) on 4-9<br />\nshooting. Widener's coach implored his players to be conscious<br />\nof Enfield's location at all times.<br />\nDuring every timeout he could be<br />\nheard saying, \"Know where Enfield is!
