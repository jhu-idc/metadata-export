That's because we pack each and<br />\nevery Lucky full to the brim with long, even<br />\nstrands of the finest Turkish and domestic<br />\ntobaccos\u2014only the center leaves. Not the top<br />\nleaves\u2014because those are under-developed.<br /><br />\nNot the bottom leaves\u2014because those are inferior in quality. We use only the center leaves<br />\n\u2014because they are the mildest and fully ripe<br />\nfor perfect smoking. That's why Luckies<br />\nalways draw easily, burn evenly \u2014and are<br />\nalways mild and smooth. So smoke a Lucky,<br />\na fully packed cigarette. And remember,\"It's<br />\ntoasted\"\u2014for throat protection\u2014for finer taste.<br /><br />\nFrom the Diamond Horse-Shoe<br />\nof the<br />\nMetropolitan Opera House<br />\nEvery Saturday at z P.
