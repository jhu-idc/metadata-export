Men travel all over<br />\nthe world in order to be able to study under certain scholars.<br />\nEven a Hopkins undergraduate can choose his courses.<br />\nAt least four new men will be needed next year to take<br />\nthe places of Doctors Bright, Greene, Vincent, and Thatch. Two<br />\nof these vacancies have already been filled tentatively, but as<br />\nboth of them are heads of departments, the undergraduate is<br />\nlittle concerned. The other positions, however, are those of<br />\nundergraduate instructors. No announcements have been made<br />\nby our Sphinx-like administrators in reference to possibilities<br />\nfor these posts. Although the student body is, or should be,<br />\nvitally interested in the matter their wishes, and even their<br />\nhopes, are not even considered.<br />\nWill Hopkins get some really creative men in the English<br />\nDepartment? Will there be \"big names\" or big men here next<br />\nyear?
