THE NEWS-LETTER realizes<br />\nthat business is business. It realizes<br />\nthat unless the public believes that<br />\nthe supply of year-books is limited<br />\nit will not put its hand down far<br />\nenough into its pocket to find the<br />\ntwo-dollar bill which is covered up<br />\nby trie big, red, spotted handkerchief which we have been<br />\nbrought up to believe the public always carries in its pocket. THE<br />\nNEws-LETTER has a few business<br />\nwrinkles of its own, to be sure. It<br />\ndoes not begrudge the Hullabaloo<br />\nthis one, but it must protest against<br />\nthe \"do it now\" part of the sign<br />\nwhich very early publication of the<br />\nbook makes necessary. It must<br />\nspeak out against the order which<br />\nhas been issued by the editor-inchief of the Hullabaloo that all<br />\nbiographies must be handed in at<br />\nonce, though the biographies of at<br />\n<br />\nleast one-third of the members of the<br />\nsenior .class are not yet complete.<br />\nOne-third of the members refuse<br />\nto be Oslerized in the middle of<br />\ntheir senior year.<br />\nAnd who are these ?\u2022 First, the<br />\nwinners of the P B K keys; secondly, the men who win their \"H's\"'<br />\nfor the first time in one of the<br />\nspring sports; thirdly, senior members of the tennis team; fourthly,<br />\nthe winner of the Tocqueville<br />\nmedal; fifthly, the winner of the<br />\nMohonk essay medal; and so the<br />\nwriter might go on, if he wished to,<br />\nbut he doesn't.<br />\nThe biographies in the Hullabaloo are supposed to be complete<br />\nrecords of what the various members of the senior class have accomplished during their four years<br />\nat college. If the Hullabaloo is<br />\npublished now, those biographies<br />\ncannot be complete. The man who<br />\nhas spent his four years earning a<br />\nP B K key will be denied the right<br />\nto publish in his year-book, which<br />\nhe is expected to buy, the fact that<br />\nhis ambition is realized\u2014the fact<br />\nthat he has won a key. The man<br />\nwho wins his \"H. A. A.\" in football in his senior year is permitted<br />\nto publish the fact; the man who<br />\nwins his \"H\" in baseball is not<br />\npermitted to publish his greater<br />\nhonor. The first will be considered<br />\none of Hopkins athletes by the fair<br />\nones who read the book; the second<br />\nmight as well not have even come<br />\nout for the baseball team at all.<br />\nIf what is in one's biography makes<br />\nno difference to the members of the<br />\nsenior class, why do we trouble with<br />\nhaving biographies?<br />\nThe 1913 Hullabaloo is the first<br />\nyear-book to be published in the<br />\nlast few years. The date of its<br />\npublication will set the date for the<br />\npublication for future books. And<br />\nso for years the men who do things<br />\nafter the date on which the editors<br />\nof the Hullabaloo publish the classbook (and it is the class' book)<br />\nwill go down in minds of future<br />\nstudents who read the Hullabaloo<br />\nin the Y.

Almost 250 people<br />\nattended the concert and showed<br />\ntheir appreciation of the musicians'<br />\nefforts by loudly applauding and demanding frequent encores. The Instrumental Club won special glory<br />\nby its good work, and the quartette<br />\ngained the good will of everyone.<br />\nAfter the concert, ice cream and<br />\ncake were sold (except to the Hopkins men, and they were delightfully<br />\nsurprised by having it given to them<br />\ngratis). Everyone seemed to enjoy<br />\nthe \"social hour\" which the ice<br />\ncream and cake stimulated.<br />\nOn Thursday evening, the 27th,<br />\nthe Clubs set out in the drizzling<br />\nrain and journeyed to the Catonsville High School. In spite of the<br />\nweather and the muddy roads, about<br />\n150 people gathered to hear the concert. It was one of the best the<br />\nClubs have given, and repeatedly<br />\ndrew forth the applause or the<br />\nrisibilities of the audience. After<br />\nthe concert, the floor was cleared<br />\nof the chairs, and a dance followed<br />\ntill midnight. Several of the chaperones had not made the acquaintance of the Tango Dance, and<br />\nstopped one of the early dances because they thought several couples<br />\nwere \"doin' the turkey trot.\" But<br />\nthey were soon enlightened, and<br />\nthe dancing proceeded:<br />\nThose who took part in the concerts were: Messrs.

C., wife<br />\nof the Assistant Secretary of State.<br />\nDr. Howell was introduced by<br />\nDr. Barker, professor of medicine<br />\nat Hopkins. When Dr. Howell<br />\nrose to speak, he said that he would<br />\nfirst explain eugenics as a preface<br />\nto his lecture. The aim of eugenics,<br />\nhe went on to say, is the perpetuation of the best strains of the human race. Just as plants are grafted to produce new and better plants<br />\nand just as care is taken to breed<br />\nonly healthy animals, so only good<br />\nstrains of human life should be perpetuated.<br />\nThe claims of eugenics are being<br />\nmore and more widely recognized,<br />\nand some of its principles are being<br />\nincorporated into law, taking the<br />\nform of restrictions on marriage.<br />\n'1 he plan of the supporters of the<br />\npropaganda is to refuse marriage<br />\nlicenses to members of pauper and<br />\ncriminal families. It has been<br />\nproved that unfortunate characteristics are passed on from generation<br />\nto generation, and that one way to<br />\nprevent their reappearance is to refuse marriage permits to persons<br />\nknown to possess the undesirable<br />\nqualities. Dr. Howell said: \"Children inherit the characteristics of<br />\ntheir parents. A person is developed according to the characteristics<br />\nof his strain, and these characteristics are not only his personal<br />\nproperty, but he must pass them<br />\non.\" He declared that a reliable<br />\nsuperintendent of an almshouse reported that out of 1o5 children born<br />\nto people under his charge 102 were<br />\nfeeble minded.<br />\nForest Park.

The two prizes<br />\nof seventy-five and fifty dollars are<br />\noffered yearly by the Maryland<br />\nPeace Society to that student in any<br />\nMaryland college who, as representative of his college, makes the best<br />\noriginal oration on some subject<br />\nconnected with international arbitration at an intercollegiate contest<br />\nto be held on April 4 in McCoy<br />\nHall.

It realizes<br />\nthat unless the public believes that<br />\nthe supply of year-books is limited<br />\nit will not put its hand down far<br />\nenough into its pocket to find the<br />\ntwo-dollar bill which is covered up<br />\nby trie big, red, spotted handkerchief which we have been<br />\nbrought up to believe the public always carries in its pocket. THE<br />\nNEws-LETTER has a few business<br />\nwrinkles of its own, to be sure. It<br />\ndoes not begrudge the Hullabaloo<br />\nthis one, but it must protest against<br />\nthe \"do it now\" part of the sign<br />\nwhich very early publication of the<br />\nbook makes necessary. It must<br />\nspeak out against the order which<br />\nhas been issued by the editor-inchief of the Hullabaloo that all<br />\nbiographies must be handed in at<br />\nonce, though the biographies of at<br /><br />\nleast one-third of the members of the<br />\nsenior .class are not yet complete.<br />\nOne-third of the members refuse<br />\nto be Oslerized in the middle of<br />\ntheir senior year.<br />\nAnd who are these ?\u2022 First, the<br />\nwinners of the P B K keys; secondly, the men who win their \"H's\"'<br />\nfor the first time in one of the<br />\nspring sports; thirdly, senior members of the tennis team; fourthly,<br />\nthe winner of the Tocqueville<br />\nmedal; fifthly, the winner of the<br />\nMohonk essay medal; and so the<br />\nwriter might go on, if he wished to,<br />\nbut he doesn't.<br />\nThe biographies in the Hullabaloo are supposed to be complete<br />\nrecords of what the various members of the senior class have accomplished during their four years<br />\nat college. If the Hullabaloo is<br />\npublished now, those biographies<br />\ncannot be complete. The man who<br />\nhas spent his four years earning a<br />\nP B K key will be denied the right<br />\nto publish in his year-book, which<br />\nhe is expected to buy, the fact that<br />\nhis ambition is realized\u2014the fact<br />\nthat he has won a key. The man<br />\nwho wins his \"H. A. A.\" in football in his senior year is permitted<br />\nto publish the fact; the man who<br />\nwins his \"H\" in baseball is not<br />\npermitted to publish his greater<br />\nhonor. The first will be considered<br />\none of Hopkins athletes by the fair<br />\nones who read the book; the second<br />\nmight as well not have even come<br />\nout for the baseball team at all.<br />\nIf what is in one's biography makes<br />\nno difference to the members of the<br />\nsenior class, why do we trouble with<br />\nhaving biographies?<br />\nThe 1913 Hullabaloo is the first<br />\nyear-book to be published in the<br />\nlast few years. The date of its<br />\npublication will set the date for the<br />\npublication for future books. And<br />\nso for years the men who do things<br />\nafter the date on which the editors<br />\nof the Hullabaloo publish the classbook (and it is the class' book)<br />\nwill go down in minds of future<br />\nstudents who read the Hullabaloo<br />\nin the Y.

Howell, profesor of physiology in the Hopkins<br />\nMedical School, lectured last Thursday afternoon in McCoy Hall on<br />\nthe subject of `Eugenics.\" The<br />\nlecture was one of several to be delivered before American student<br />\nbodies, which have been made possible by a gift of Mrs. Huntington<br />\nWilson of Washington, D. C., wife<br />\nof the Assistant Secretary of State.<br />\nDr. Howell was introduced by<br />\nDr. Barker, professor of medicine<br />\nat Hopkins. When Dr. Howell<br />\nrose to speak, he said that he would<br />\nfirst explain eugenics as a preface<br />\nto his lecture. The aim of eugenics,<br />\nhe went on to say, is the perpetuation of the best strains of the human race. Just as plants are grafted to produce new and better plants<br />\nand just as care is taken to breed<br />\nonly healthy animals, so only good<br />\nstrains of human life should be perpetuated.<br />\nThe claims of eugenics are being<br />\nmore and more widely recognized,<br />\nand some of its principles are being<br />\nincorporated into law, taking the<br />\nform of restrictions on marriage.<br />\n'1 he plan of the supporters of the<br />\npropaganda is to refuse marriage<br />\nlicenses to members of pauper and<br />\ncriminal families. It has been<br />\nproved that unfortunate characteristics are passed on from generation<br />\nto generation, and that one way to<br />\nprevent their reappearance is to refuse marriage permits to persons<br />\nknown to possess the undesirable<br />\nqualities. Dr. Howell said: \"Children inherit the characteristics of<br />\ntheir parents. A person is developed according to the characteristics<br />\nof his strain, and these characteristics are not only his personal<br />\nproperty, but he must pass them<br />\non.\" He declared that a reliable<br />\nsuperintendent of an almshouse reported that out of 1o5 children born<br />\nto people under his charge 102 were<br />\nfeeble minded.<br />\nForest Park. This will probably<br />\nwind up this year's season, and the<br />\nClubs' managers are hoping that<br />\nthese concerts will leave them in<br />\ngood financial condition.<br /><br />\nEXCLUSIVE<br />\nIDEAS<br /><br />\nPRELIMINARY PEACE CONTEST<br />\nTo Se'ect Hopkins'Representative for the<br />\nIntercollegiate Contest\u2014Two Prizes<br />\nOfferrd Maryland Students.<br /><br />\nA splendid opportunity to win a<br />\nprize of seventy-five or fifty dolhrs,<br />\nto have a chance to compete for two<br />\nmore sets of such prizes, to maintain the proud reputation Hopkins<br />\nhas won in oratorical contests in the<br />\npast few years, will be given to<br />\nevery student of the University on<br />\nMarch 15 at the preliminary oratorical contest to be held in McCoy<br />\nHall on that date. The two prizes<br />\nof seventy-five and fifty dollars are<br />\noffered yearly by the Maryland<br />\nPeace Society to that student in any<br />\nMaryland college who, as representative of his college, makes the best<br />\noriginal oration on some subject<br />\nconnected with international arbitration at an intercollegiate contest<br />\nto be held on April 4 in McCoy<br />\nHall. The selection of Hopkins'<br />\nrepresentative, who will compete in<br />\nthe intercollegiate contest, will be<br />\nmade at the preliminary contest on<br />\nMarch 15. The man who wins the<br />\nfirst prize in the Maryland contest<br />\nis entitled to compete with the winners of similar contests in our<br />\nneighboring States. The man who<br />\nwins that contest will compete with<br />\nthe men who have defeated the representatives of the States which surround their native States. This last<br />\ncontest is held at Lake Mohonk at<br />\nthe time of the annual peace conference which always takes place<br />\nthere.
