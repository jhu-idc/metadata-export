Close to 80 neighborhoods will be represented, and a<br />\nlarge number of other organizations and businesses will also be<br />\npresent. The fair, which commemorates the city's 250th<br />\nanniversary, has another historical dimension: it will take place<br />\non the 165th anniversary of the<br />\nwriting of Francis Scott Key's<br />\n\"The Star Spangled Banner.\"<br />\nThe idea of having a city<br />\nfair was conceived in response to<br />\nthe tension that arose in<br />\nBaltimore during the late 1960's.<br />\nAt that time, the Fair was seen<br />\nas a way to bring people together by showcasing the various<br />\nethnic and neighborhood groups<br />\nwithin Baltimore. It is not<br />\nactually sponsored by the city<br />\ngovernment, but by a volunteer<br />\ncorporation. Most of the work<br />\ninvolved in planning and hosting<br />\nthe fair is done by volunteers,<br />\nwhose activities are supplemented by a small paid staff.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has participated actively in the Fair since it<br />\nwas first held in 1970. At that<br />\ntime Dea Andersen Kline, now<br />\nDirector of Community Affairs<br />\nat the University, pledged Hopkins' help in recruiting and<br />\norganizing non-profit groups for<br />\nthe Fair. Kline is participating<br />\nin this year's opening ceremonies, where she will present<br />\nMayor William Schaefer with a<br />\nreproduction of one of the first<br />\nedition copies of \"The Star<br />\nSpangled Banner.\" The facsimile will also be distributed to<br />\nwho attend the<br />\nfairgoers<br />\nHopkins exhibit.<br />\nAt 2 p.m. on Friday, the<br />\nMayor and the Senior Alumni<br />\nwill participate in an 80th<br />\nbirthday salute to President<br />\nEmeritus Milton S. Eisenhower.<br />\nOther Hopkins activities include<br />\na videotape on a newly-developed power-assisted wheelchair and<br />\n<br />\nmedical manipulator, presented<br />\nby the Applied Physics Laboratory (Friday and Sunday from<br />\nnoon to 7 p.m.; Saturday from<br />\n10 a.m. to 7 p.m.); a presentation<br />\nof \"The Wonderful World of<br />\nMaterials\" by Professors Robert<br />\nE. Green and Robert B. Pond of<br />\nthe Whiting School of Engineering (Saturday and Sunday,1 to 2<br />\np.m.); and demonstrations of<br />\ncardio-pulmonary resuscitation<br />\n(CPR) by the University's<br />\nEmergency Medicine Department (Saturday and Sunday,<br />\n2 to 4 p.m.). Also, a children's<br />\n\"percussion workshop\", sponsored by the Peabody Institute,<br />\nwill be held from 10 a.m. to<br />\nnoon on Saturday.<br />\nVolunteers from all areas<br />\nof the Hopkins community will<br />\nbe present to greet fairgoers,<br />\nhost the Hopkins exhibit, and<br />\ndistribute materials on the Evening College, Summer Session and<br />\ngood health rules. There will be<br />\nnurse recruiting from 10 a.m. to<br />\nnoon on Saturday. Kline sees the<br />\nHopkins exhibit as a means for<br />\nmembers of the different divisions of Johns Hopkins to<br />\nbecome familiar with one another, in much the same way<br />\nthat the fair itself helps people<br />\n<br />\nfrom the different communities<br />\nin Baltimore to become acquainted and overcome their differences.<br />\nA large number of the<br />\nactivities at the Fair will be<br />\nsponsored by the neighborhood<br />\nand civic groups: games, rides,<br />\nfood stands, and local craftsmen<br />\nwill all be a part of the entertainment. In addition, there will<br />\nbe four large stages at the Fair<br />\nthat will feature \"name\" entertainers.

Their main<br />\nobjection was that the Code did<br />\nnot define the University's jurisdiction clearly enough.<br />\nThe Code defines academic offenses as those which<br />\n\"constitute direct or material<br />\ndamage and/or 'threats to the<br />\nhealth, safety or property of the<br />\nmembers of the University<br />\ncommunity or damage to the<br />\nphysical facilities of the University, and occur on University<br />\nproperty or arise from the<br />\nstudent's affiliation with the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nLoebel said that her committee will concentrate on drafting a code specific enough to<br />\nprotect both University and<br />\nstudent interests. \"It's a very<br />\ndifficult problem to strike that<br />\nbalance, to protect everybody,\"<br />\nshe said. Loebel also plans<br />\nto reexamine the positions assigned to University administrators in the adjudication process.<br />\nHarry Lerner, one of last<br />\nyear's objectors to the Code,<br />\nrecently made this statement:<br />\n\"We need not just elaborate<br />\nrules of disciplinary procedure,<br />\nbut the substantial protection of<br />\nexplicit limits on\u2022 the University's authority. Anything less<br />\nonly legitimizes the administration's arbitrary powers.<br />\n\"Unfortunately, the leading figures on the Student<br />\nCouncil are the same students<br />\nwho endorsed last year's proposal by the Council, which was<br />\n<br />\ndefeated by student referendum.<br />\nAt least one member has said<br />\nthat the same version should be<br />\nresubmitted this year.\"<br />\nThe Code will deal only<br />\nwith non-academic offenses.<br />\nThe Ethics Board will continue<br />\nto handle academic problems.<br />\nUnder the system proposed in<br />\nthe most recent draft of the<br />\nCode, The Director of Student<br />\nServices will certify a charge<br />\n(since that position has been<br />\neliminated, this duty will be<br />\nreassigned).

If<br />\nnew evidence in a case is discovered, the student may have his<br />\ncase redetermined within 15 days<br />\nof notifying the University.<br />\nAppeals are directed to the<br />\nProvost.

The volunteers spend a total of three hours<br />\neach week (two 90-minute sessions) with their tutees on the<br />\nHopkins Campus, in an efiort to<br />\nimprove the child's basic skills<br />\nwhile making the learning experience an enjoyable one.<br />\nThis year the Tutorial Project is being run by Ralph<br />\nSanchez (replacing former director David Fishkin) along with<br />\nAssistant Directors Douglas<br />\nBoardman and Anne Hirsch.<br />\nSanchez, described the program's one-to-one tutoring situation as \"unique, because it<br />\nprovides a personal element that<br />\ngives kids the individual attention they might not normally get<br />\n<br />\nin school.\" He feels that this<br />\nindividual focus makes up for<br />\nthe relatively short time that the<br />\nstudents actually spend with<br />\ntheir tutors. The fact that they<br />\nare taught on the Hopkins<br />\nCampus brings the children into<br />\ncontact with new and stimulating aspects of education such as<br />\nexploring the laboratories and<br />\ncomputer rooms -- an experience<br />\nmany of them would not normally get.<br />\nOther changes besides administrative ones are either<br />\nplanned or have already taken<br />\nplace. The Project has applied<br />\nfor a Federal Grant through the<br />\nprogram (Reading Is<br />\nFundamental) which supplies<br />\nmatching funds for the purchase<br />\nof books.

Yes, even you S. & B.S.<br />\nmajors will have to \u2014 sorry, there's just no avoiding it.<br />\nThis year, however, a new treat awaits you on freshly-carpeted M Level which should make the trip a bit more<br />\ninteresting.<br />\nAt first we had some difficulty in divining the purpose<br />\nof the Library's new \"Tattletape\" (what a cute name)<br />\nBook-Theft Detector. This electronic Sam Spade cost a<br />\ncool ten G's and certainly appears threatening enough \u2014<br />\nbut it was the usefulness of this new toy that had us<br />\nbaffled. It certainly couldn't have been installed in order<br />\nto save any money, because it's obvious that even if it<br />\nbecomes 100% effective (don't hold your breath) there<br />\nwill still have to be at least one guard on duty to check<br />\nincoming IDs, stop malefactors who set off the beeper<br />\nand tell those with luminous watch dials to setp back and<br />\ngo through again without them.<br />\nDid the Library spend all that money just to make M<br />\nLevel look like an airport concourse? We thought so at<br />\nfirst, but after a little pondering the real answer became<br />\napparent. Since the system operates by emitting microwaves, it must exist for the sole purpose of killing those<br />\nLibrary patrons who wear electronic pacemakers. We can<br />\nsee the Library's point readily enough. After all, the old<br />\ngeezers are living on borrowed time, and it must be a huge<br />\nannoyance to have to drag them up out of the stacks when<br />\nthey kick the bucket on D Level. This dandy new machine<br />\nplants'em at the door, where body removal is considerably<br />\neasier.<br />\nThe point is that the new machine is merely window<br />\ndressing: it looks impressive and costs a lot of dough,(our<br />\ndough, don't forget,) but it doesn't contribute to the<br />\ntruely important business of the University. A library with<br />\nten thousand dollars worth of additional books is far<br />\nsuperior to one which can qualify for admission to the Air<br />\n& Space Museum by virtue of its fancy hardware.<br />\nThis attitude of putting appearance ahead of substance<br />\nis by no means confined to the Library \u2014 rather, it is<br />\ncampus wide. This same type of fuzzy thinking produced<br />\nsuch marvels as the Great Wall of Hopkins -- that meandering structure on the campus' southern fringe. Not only is<br />\nit expensive and strictly for show (who is it supposed to<br />\nkeep out...or in?,) but it looks as though it was designed<br />\nby someone who was enjoying his twelth martini at the<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe next time this University's money moguls find<br />\nthemselves in the possession of a little mad money, why<br />\ndon't they consider spending it to keep on a professor or<br />\ntwo, or upgrade some laboratory equipment? It is the<br />\nsubstance of a school which makes it a quality institution,<br />\nnot the amount of ivy on the walls, and even Hopkins<br />\ncannot afford to waste money on paltry cosmetics. Remember boys, beauty is only skin deep.<br />\n<br />\n-Sot<br />\n<br />\no<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n0.<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n,,/<br />\n<br />\nt4 \u2022 '<br />\n<br />\n11 \u2022 i \u2022<br />\nNis 4<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n..Ary<br />\n<br />\nDr. Steven Muller's<br />\nrespect for art is equaled only<br />\nby his knowledge of the names<br />\nand faces of every undergraduate<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nThe university<br />\npossesses some of the finest art<br />\ncollections in the United States,<br />\nbut how does the administration<br />\nshow its appreciation of these<br />\ncultural treasures? By selling<br />\nthem, that's how.<br />\nParts of the highly-esteemed Garrett coin collection<br />\nare being sold. The Gilmor<br />\ndrawings, another first-rate<br />\nHopkins-owned collection, will<br />\nlikewise be put on the auctioneer's block. I certainly would<br />\nnot deny the university its right<br />\nto sell anything it owns; rather, I<br />\nquestion the reasoning behind<br />\nthe sale of these art works.<br />\nHopkins officials claim<br />\nthe university needs some quick<br />\ncash, ostensibly for the impecunious Peabody Conservatory.<br />\nGranted, these are inflationary<br />\ntimes, but a well-heeled institution like Hopkins can hardly he<br />\n<br />\nstrapped for bucks, can it? If<br />\nfunds are needed to bail out any<br />\ndivision of the university, then<br />\nsurely the money can be raised<br />\nsome way other than by selling<br />\nthe Garrett coins and the Gilmor<br />\ndrawings.<br />\nPerhaps university<br />\nofficials just find this an easy<br />\nand convenient method. That<br />\nkind of \"garage sale\" mentality<br />\nmay be permissible in suburban<br />\nhousewives, but not in the<br />\nadministrators of a renowned<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nMoreover, Dr. Muller<br />\nmust realize the worth of the<br />\ncollections to art historians and<br />\nother scholars (many of which,<br />\nincidentally, can often be found<br />\non the JHU campus.) Hopkins is<br />\na business, but above and<br />\nbeyond all else, it is in the<br />\nbusiness of education.<br />\nLastly, these collections<br />\nwere intended by their donors to<br />\nedify and give pleasure to<br />\nthe citizens of Baltimore. Dr.<br />\nMuller would do well to keep<br />\nthat in mind before he goes<br />\npeddling the Garrett coins, the<br />\nGilmor drawings, the Peabody<br />\n<br />\npaintings, the Evergreen House,<br />\nor anything else the university<br />\nhappens to own by way of<br />\ninheritance. (In defense of the<br />\nsales, Dr. Muller has stated that<br />\nHopkins has neither the funds to<br />\ninsure these various art collections nor the space to exhibit<br />\nthem properly \u2014 other pressing<br />\nmatters, of course, come first,<br />\nsuch as paying the electric bill<br />\nfor the Mudd Building. Local<br />\nmuseum curators, who are outraged over the possible loss of<br />\nthe collections, would be all too<br />\nhappy to take them on loan<br />\nfrom the university and exhibit<br />\nthem at the Walters Art Gallery<br />\nor the Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nAt least that way they would remain<br />\nin Baltimore, where they belong.<br />\nHad Baltimore's late art<br />\ncollectors foreseen that Hopkins<br />\nwould someday have an avid<br />\nart fan like Steve Muller as<br />\npresident, then they might have<br />\nbequeathed their treasures to<br />\nsome school that would have<br />\nbeen more appreciative -- like,<br />\nsay, Towson State University<br />\nor Essex Community College.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nFrosh<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWith all due respect to the<br />\nnewswriters of last week's article<br />\non Freshmen Orientation, I feel<br />\nthat some of the things I was<br />\nquoted as saying may have been<br />\nill-timed, poorly stated or<br />\nmisinterpreted.<br />\nFirst off, when I said, \"If<br />\nit wasn't for my low budget and<br />\nmy social committee,everything<br />\nwould have gone great\" I meant.<br />\nno slur against the committee On<br />\ntheir overall effort and performance. As a matter of fact, I feel<br />\nthe committee( Audrey Zettich,<br />\nBruce Karner and Amy Caplan)<br />\ndid an excellent job, and each<br />\nsocial event was well planned for<br />\nand very well executed (problems occurring during any of the<br />\nevents were by no means the<br />\nfault of the committee). I was<br />\namazed at how well put together<br />\nthe social calendar for the week<br />\nhad been set-up, especially in the<br />\ntime they took. My comment<br />\nwas taken out of context. It did<br />\nexpress my feelings in mid-July<br />\nwhen I had a million things on<br />\nmy mind,and social planning for<br />\nOrientation hadn't begun, but it<br />\nDOES NOT reflect my opinion<br />\nof their performance, and furthermore, Amy does deserve an<br />\nawful lot of credit for what she<br />\ndid.<br />\nMy second point of correction is where Karl Block<br />\nasked the social committee to<br />\n<br />\ntake over financial management.<br />\nI was not present when Karl<br />\nspoke to the other committee<br />\nmembers so I could only speculate as to what went on while I<br />\nwas away. I left some things to<br />\nbe done in my absence, and I do<br />\nknow that the committee got<br />\ntogether, but I honestly can't<br />\nknow what was said at the time.<br />\nMy other comments such<br />\nas those on \"personality conflicts\" and \"the group not<br />\nworking well together\" also<br />\nseemed to be out of place.<br />\nPersonality conflicts are to be<br />\ntaken for granted since people<br />\nwho normally aren't \"in the<br />\nsame group\" can't be expected<br />\nto become friends with other<br />\npeople just because they happened to have been picked to<br />\nwork together on a school<br />\ncommittee. The committee not<br />\nworking well together seems to<br />\nbe contradicted by the fact that<br />\nOrientation was such a success.<br />\nYes, we made mistakes, and<br />\nsometimes disagreed, but we're<br />\nonly human, and are subject to<br />\nerror and changes in disposition.<br />\nOnce again I thank everyone on my committee and<br />\nextend my apologies to those<br />\noffended by my comments of<br />\nlast week. If there are still any<br />\nquestions about what I may have<br />\nmeant or the context of anything else I said, I'm willing to<br />\ndiscuss them with the offended<br />\nparties.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nFrannie Garfinkel<br />\n<br />\nReFrosh<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe recent article on<br />\nfreshmen orientation was very<br />\nunfair to all of the people who<br />\ncame through and worked so<br />\nhard to make orientation a<br />\nsuccess. The weekly News-Letter<br />\nis not the place to discuss the<br />\n\"dirty laundry\" of committee<br />\nmembers, but to emphasize the<br />\nenjoyment of the activities of<br />\norientation week. It seems to me<br />\nthat the issue of personality<br />\nconflicts, ego trips and money<br />\nproblems are everyday occurences. Orientation comes around<br />\nbut once a year. After everyone<br />\nhas experienced a week of hassle<br />\nfree fun, why is a negative<br />\nattitude<br />\ndisplayed<br />\ntoward<br />\nfreshman Orientation?<br />\nFor a committee that<br />\nwasn't doing anything, there<br />\nsure seemed to be a lot of<br />\nsocializing going on.<br />\nAmy Caplan<br />\nSocial Director<br />\n<br />\nMs. Caplan 'S objections show<br />\nthat she misunderstood the<br />\ntheme of the article and the<br />\nreasons for describing the problems the Committee faced.<br />\nAs set forth in the second<br />\nparagraph, the article sets up<br />\na contrast between the success<br />\nof the program (as indicated<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nNew Student Assistant;<br />\nMarshal Salant Interview ,<br />\nBY MARK TRACHTEN BERG<br />\n<br />\nSenior Marshal Salant has<br />\nbeen appointed Student Assistant to Associate Dean of<br />\nHomewood Faculties Jakie Hall.<br />\nHe will perform a wide variety<br />\nof duties, including the preparation of a comprehensive evaluation of student services, conducting a survey of student housing<br />\nneeds and preferences, and acting as ombudsman with the<br />\nAdministration for student concerns. Salant will also aid the<br />\nSecretary for the Board of<br />\nTrustees, and will help the<br />\nMetro Center coordinate the<br />\nINternational Fellows program<br />\nwhich brings foreign urban<br />\nspecialists to the U.S. to study<br />\nand exchange information about<br />\ncity problems.<br />\nSalant emphasized that he<br />\ndoes not want to encroach upon<br />\nthe role of the Student Council.<br />\n\"George Connolly is a fine guy,\"<br />\nhe said, \"but there are always a<br />\nnumber of projects which the<br />\nS.C. simply doesn't have time to<br />\npursue.\" He cited as an example<br />\nthe Class of '79 Memorial<br />\nScholarship Fund, which Stuart<br />\nDavidson, last year's Student<br />\nAssistant, played a major role in<br />\nsetting up.<br />\nSalant also does not want to<br />\nact or be seen as a barrier<br />\nbetween other students and the<br />\nAdministration. \"Jakie really<br />\ntries to be accessible, really<br />\nwants to hear directly what's<br />\nbugging students. But if for<br />\n<br />\nsome reason you can't find him<br />\nor you feel uncomfortable about<br />\ntalking to an administrator, you<br />\nshould come to me.\"<br />\nSalant has a long history of<br />\ninvolvement in student activities.<br />\nHe has served as a Student<br />\nCouncil REpresentative, directed<br />\nthe 1979 Spring Fair, and is<br />\ncurrently the housemaster of<br />\nWilson-Wood. \"I've always felt<br />\nthat the wily way to improve<br />\nlife at Hopkins is to get involved<br />\nwith the Administration and<br />\n<br />\nvoice our concerns,\" Salant<br />\nsaid. \"I suppose I feel a duty to<br />\ndo it, but i'm certainly no<br />\nmartyr. I really enjoy running<br />\nevents, and the administrative<br />\nexperience is very important,<br />\nsince I plan to go to business<br />\nschool.\"<br />\nAs a Mathematical Sciences<br />\nmajor, Salant feels that not<br />\nbeing pre-med br pre-law gives<br />\nhim more time for extracurricular activities. \"Besides,\" he<br />\nadds, \"I never have been the<br />\ntype to spend a huge amount of<br />\n<br />\ntime studying. What I did for<br />\nSpring Fair was far more valuable to me than any of my<br />\nclasses. I wouldn't have been<br />\nable to enjoy it so much otherwise.\"<br />\nSalant believes that the<br />\nnotorious apathy of Hopkins<br />\nstudents can be overcome: \"It's<br />\npointless to sit in your room,<br />\nbitching about how nobody<br />\ncares. I made it a point to get<br />\npeople who had never been<br />\nactive (in student organizations)<br />\nbefore involved in Spring Fair.<br />\nWe had 60 people on the Fair<br />\nCommittee, where the year<br />\nbefore it had been 12. The wider<br />\ninvolvement helped make it a<br />\nsuccess.<br />\n\"But it's true that it's<br />\nharder to get the mass of students involved than it was in<br />\nhigh school. The woi-kload is<br />\nmuch greater, and a lot of<br />\npeople who did stuff in high<br />\nschool just stick to the books<br />\nhere. And of the people who are<br />\ninvolved, too many of them are<br />\ninto rhetoric. Politicians-in-training. They'll go on and on<br />\nabout how we have an ethical<br />\nobligation to do something when<br />\nthe only relevant issge is whether we can afford it. I stress<br />\npracticality and finances, not<br />\nmoral crusades.<br />\n\"So it's easy to see how<br />\nsomeone might have a gripe, but<br />\nbe completely turned off on the<br />\npossibliity of doing something<br />\nabout it.

The House is a temporary<br />\nshelter for battered women<br />\n(those physically abused by their<br />\nspouses or men they live with).<br />\nThe volunteers participate in all<br />\naspects of the program, answering the hot-line, meeting with<br />\nabused women, and caring for<br />\ntheir children.

For those serving<br />\nprison sentences there is a<br />\none-to-one prison visitation program in which volunteers ate<br />\nassigned an inmate with an<br />\nimmediate need and work towards solving his or her particular problem. For example, the<br />\nprisoner may have been supporting a family, in which case the<br />\nvolunteer will help establish<br />\ncommunication with family<br />\nmembers.

They<br />\nexpressed the hope that some<br />\ngraduate students specializing in<br />\neducation would do an evaluative study on the effects of the<br />\ntutoring, as they lack the resources necessary to subsidize<br />\nsuch a project.<br />\nAlso planned is a day-long<br />\ntrip to the Smithsonian in<br />\nWashington D.C. in which the<br />\ntutors and their friends would<br />\naccompany the tutees on a tour<br />\nof the museum.<br />\nSanchez is confident that<br />\nmany new tutors will volunteer.<br />\nHe encourages all students to<br />\nsign up for the program - especially freshmen and transfer students as it is a good way to meet<br />\nstuder,ts from Hopkins as well as<br />\nfrom surrounding schools.

Guest<br />\nspeakers discuss social and political issues of current improtance.<br />\nSpeaking on \"Women's Rights in<br />\nthe Twentieth Century\" were<br />\nElisbeth Bothe, Associate Judge<br />\nof the Supreme Bench of<br />\nBaltimore City; Ann Wilson,<br />\nfamily sociologist at UMBC;and<br />\nEdyth Schoenrich, Associate<br />\nDean of the Hopkins School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Wilson, the<br />\nfundemental problem all working women face is the critical<br />\neconomic situation. Although<br />\nmore women are aorking, the<br />\nincome gap between males and<br />\nfemales is becoming wider. With<br />\nfewer jobs available and increasing numbers of applicants,<br />\n\"Women not only must be as<br />\ngood as men to be considered<br />\nfor a job-- but the qualifications<br />\nfor men are increasing.\"<br />\nWilson expressed concern<br />\nabout women in higher education. Though more women are<br />\nattending graduate and professional schools, the median number of years they spend in higher<br />\neducation is decreasing. She<br />\npointed out that the proportion<br />\nof women in academia has not<br />\nincreased since the 60's.<br />\n<br />\nBothe said that although<br />\nwomen in the professions are<br />\noften able through preferential<br />\ntreatment to advance more<br />\nrapidly than men, they \"have<br />\nnever been able to advance<br />\nthemselves on a par\" with other<br />\ndisadvantaged groups. She cited<br />\nas an example the success of the<br />\ncoordinated black movement in<br />\nBaltimore to create a demand<br />\nfor black lawyers. \"Now there<br />\naren't enough black lawyers to<br />\nmeet the demand or need,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nBothe said that without a<br />\ncohesive women's force to direct<br />\nits interpretation, ERA has most<br />\noften been used to benefit<br />\nmen. \"we now have male airline<br />\nstewardesses, men getting maternity leave, and shorter policemen,\" she said.<br />\nSchoenrich said that combining a career and a family was<br />\n\"Not Easy, and yet worth the<br />\neffort to do both.\" Bothe called<br />\nfor a men's consciousness-raising<br />\nrevolution. Wilson expressed her<br />\nhope for a sharing or roles<br />\nbetween men and women with<br />\nrespect to career and family.<br />\n<br />\nKen Kiesler<br />\nGlee Club Head<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Glee Club has a new<br />\nmusical director, its third in<br />\nas many years. Its previous<br />\ndirector, Hugh Wolff, left his<br />\npost at Hopkins to take on the<br />\nassistant conductorship of the<br />\nNational Symphony Orchestra in<br />\nWashington<br />\nD. C. under<br />\nRostapovich. Replacing Wolff is<br />\nKen Kiesler, who is also the<br />\nconductor of the Peabody Conservatory Chamber Orchestra,<br />\nChorus and Chamber Chorus, as<br />\nwell as being the Music Director<br />\nand Conductor of the Prince<br />\nGeorges County Philharmonic.<br />\nThis changeover seems to<br />\nhave had no disruptive effect on<br />\nthe choir whatsoever. Over 75<br />\nstudents showed up at the open<br />\nrehearsals held this past Monday<br />\n- practically double the size of<br />\nlast year's group, according to<br />\nchoir president Suber Huang.<br />\nWhile the first meeting of the<br />\n<br />\nTHE STROH BREWERY COMPANY, DETROIT, MICHIGAN \u00a9 1978<br />\n<br />\nGlee Club is usually a large one,<br />\nHuang believes that most of the<br />\nstudents who came to the<br />\nMonday rehearsal will remain in<br />\nthe choir.<br />\nMany of those<br />\npresent were former members<br />\nwho decided to rejoin the Club,<br />\nor graduate students who took<br />\npart in the organization while<br />\nHuang also<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nattributes the enlarged membership to the extensive recruiting<br />\ncampaign directed towards the<br />\nfreshman this year.<br />\nThe choir's program for<br />\nthe fall is as yet undertermined,<br />\nowing to the fact that Kiesler<br />\nwas hired just this past week.<br />\nHowever, Huang estimated that<br />\nthe Glee Club would perform<br />\nfour or five concerts this season,<br />\nprobably consisting of several<br />\nshort pieces accompanied by a<br />\nstring ensemble. Kiesler is open<br />\nto program suggestions at this<br />\npoint; and is hoping to cover a<br />\nlarge range of choral music including<br />\nBenjamin<br />\nBritten<br />\npieces, Poulenc motets, spirituals<br />\nand one larger, \"substantial\"<br />\nwork.<br />\n<br />\nVolunteer<br />\ncont. from p. 7<br />\nsistance, or helping take care of<br />\nthe family.<br />\nThe second program at<br />\nOffender Aid Restoration is a<br />\nthird-party custody arrangement. Workers scan the lists of<br />\nthose arrested during the weekend and select persons whom<br />\nthey think they will be able to<br />\nhelp. The Judge can then release<br />\nthe prisoner to the organization<br />\nat a bail reduction hearing. A<br />\nvolunteer is assigned to each<br />\nprisoner, and helps him with<br />\nbasic necessities such as housing<br />\nand employment. The volunteer<br />\nappears in court at the trial and<br />\ninforms the judge of the prisoner's progress and activities.<br />\nCortez Reiney, in-jail specialist<br />\nwith Offender Aid and Restoration, spoke about the direct<br />\nimpact of the program. \"If the<br />\nprisoner can show that over 2 or<br />\n3 months he has taken initiative<br />\nto become involved in some<br />\nproductive activity such as going<br />\nto school or finding employment, this can be a deciding<br />\nfactor in the Judge's decision<br />\nconcerning the prisoner's return<br />\nto society.\"<br />\n<br />\nResponse<br />\n<br />\n\"What an act!... and he gets to do it twice a night.\"<br />\n<br />\nFor the real beer lover.<br />\n<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nby the favorable responses of<br />\nthose freshmen interviewed)and<br />\nthe obstacles with which the<br />\nCommittee had to contend. The<br />\nCommittee's \"dirty laundry\"<br />\nwas one of those; the general<br />\npersonality conflict was outlined<br />\nwithout mentioning names pr<br />\nincidents.<br />\nspecific<br />\nThe article was factual and<br />\ncompletely devoid of sensationalism in both intent and result.<br />\nI deny that any of Ms.<br />\nGarfinkel's remarks were taken<br />\nout of context. The quotes used<br />\nexpressed the general attitude<br />\nshe conveyed to me in our<br />\ninterview.<br />\n-E.P.<br />\n<br />\n\fphotos by Di-Gel Newman<br />\n<br />\nIt is often pointed out that Hopkins<br />\nstudents can, if they so desire, live at arms<br />\nlength from the real world with little or no<br />\neffert. The University, like some grand incubator for post-adolescents, is fully capable of<br />\nwrapping its protective tentacles around an<br />\nundergraduate until he altogether ceases to<br />\ninteract with the frightening world beyond big,<br />\nbad Charles Street. Not all of us fall into such a<br />\nsterile trap, of course, but the vast majority of<br />\nfolks out there think we do, which invariably<br />\nleads to some problems. Who among us has not<br />\nbeen accosted at one time or another by a<br />\nbellicose cabbie, brawny construction worker, or<br />\nother blue-collar miscontent, who, upon spying<br />\nthe Hopkins crest on our sweat-free shirt,<br />\nproceeds to chew .us out for \"not knowing<br />\na goddamn thing about what it means to work<br />\nfor a living\" and having our heads stuffed full<br />\nof \"candyass intellectual bullshit.\" The most<br />\nvexing thing about such heated verbal ambushes<br />\nis that they contain considerably more than a<br />\ngrain of truth.<br />\nThis past summer I decided to silence these<br />\ncritics and test my mettel at the same time by<br />\nplunging headlong into the job market. No more<br />\n\"ranch maintenance\" for Uncle George in the<br />\nhigh Sierras, no Ian, \"joke n' toke\" work-study<br />\njobs in the MSE stacks-- just me, a ball point<br />\npen, and the want ads.<br />\nI really wondered what was going to<br />\nhappen to my ideology. Can someone who's<br />\nread all of Ayn Rand's novels and watched<br />\nFiring Line religiously since high school go to<br />\nwork in the real marketplace for real bosses and<br />\ncome out anywhere this side of Colonel Khaddafi? The only thing I was sure of was that<br />\nno set of beliefs was worth a damn if they<br />\ncouldn't be put to a test now and again. It had<br />\nto be a difficult test, too... if working for<br />\ncapitalism really was hell, I was determined to<br />\nfind the Seventh Circle.<br />\nI found it alright-- in that distinctively<br />\nAmerican version of the Inferno-- Fast Food.<br />\nIt is no idle metaphor I've been using, for<br />\nwhen this reporter arrived for work on the first<br />\nafternoon, the kitchen was a plutonic hundred<br />\nand ten degrees. It was explained to me by one<br />\nprofusely perspiring veteran that this particular<br />\nstore had dropped below its monthly sales quota<br />\nand was therefore being \"punished\" by being<br />\nplaced at the end of the district's lengthy<br />\nmaintenance list.<br />\nIn the weeks that followed, while the Dog<br />\nDays of summer dragged their tails along the<br />\nburning concrete parking lot outside, the heat<br />\nwithin climbed to truly unbearable heights. By<br />\nthe fourth of July it was almost redundant to<br />\nturn on the stoves, as most of the cuisine would<br />\nbegin cooking the instant it was removed from<br />\nthe cooler. The managers and assistant managers, too cowed to protest to their superiors,<br />\nattempted instead to project an air of cool<br />\nunconcern to the muttering troops. Their guise<br />\nof bravado faltered, however, when one of the<br />\nmore obese capitans suddenly cried out \"Mom-<br />\n<br />\nWorking Forl:api<br />\nby Cates<br />\nmy! Help!\" in a weak voice and slumped over<br />\ninto a pot of refried beans, his dangling company tie catching fire on the gas jet.<br />\nI finally decided to put a stop to this<br />\nnonsense and called OSHA, only to be told that<br />\ndue to \"the President's deep concern over saving<br />\nenergy,\" that they were not investigating any<br />\nexcessive heat violations that summer. Like Bill<br />\nBuckley says, where is government over-regulation when you need it?<br />\nThe next step was obvious. If we couldn't<br />\nget our unseen tormentors slapped with a heavy<br />\nfine, at least we could get some breathable air<br />\nwith a little sleight of hand. All it took was a call<br />\nfrom one of the huskier-voiced employees<br />\nclaiming to be an irate customer whose darling<br />\ndaughter had fainted dead away while waiting<br />\nfor a taco in the dining area. For good measure,<br />\nhe also claimed that he was considering writing a<br />\nletter to the papers about it. Wellsir, quicker<br />\nthan you could list all the nutrients in a burrito,<br />\nwe had traded the burning Sudan for the bracing<br />\nair of Switzerland.<br />\nThus was I enlightened as to the first rule<br />\nof Fast Food: threats work better than rational<br />\ndiscussion. Managers use threats, therefore they<br />\nunderstand them. Managers don't think, therefore thinking is wasted on them.<br />\nA word or two needs to be said about how<br />\nthe Great Chain of Beans was organized in<br />\nEnchilada Land. At the bottom of the chili vat<br />\nwere the great mass of employees-- the drones as<br />\nwe called ourselves. My fellow workers were far<br />\nfrom being lumpen prolitariat-- for the most part<br />\nthey consisted of housewives, military personnel<br />\ntaking second jobs, teenagers and other people<br />\nwell toward the middle of any bell-curve you'd<br />\ncare to construct. In short, they were people<br />\nheavily in debt who lacked either the training or<br />\nrescouces or the time to seek more rewarding<br />\nwork. They were, for the most part, only<br />\nsemi-educated, but definitely not stupid. They<br />\nwere not particularly docile, either, but they<br />\nneeded money badly enough to put up with a<br />\ngreat deal of humiliation for the sake of $3.00<br />\nan hour. In one way or another, they all seemed<br />\ntrapped there ... some only temporarily, others<br />\nfor the rest of their lives.<br />\nDirectly above us were those most despised<br />\nof creatures, (and rightly so), the assistant<br />\nmanagers. Picked out from the mass of undermensch specifically for their pettyness and<br />\nass-smouching ability, the A.M.'s were given all<br />\nthe dirty and unpleasant jobs by the managers,<br />\nwhich they then performed with a sneering<br />\nrelish and .-,eemingly innate ability. The A.M.'s<br />\nwere cr;atures of rules-- beings who would have<br />\nbeen utter.y lost had they had no one to constantly t Ai them what to do, how to do it, and<br />\nwhat would happen to them if they didn't. They<br />\nloved the company with all their heart (what<br />\nthere was of it) because the company had a rule<br />\nfor literaly everything-- from stuffing enchiladas<br />\nto breaking wind. The company excused them<br />\nfrom thinking, excused them from feeling.., and<br />\nthey were eternally grateful.<br />\nAll these many rules were put down for the<br />\nenlightenment of the Chosen in two, thick<br />\nvolumes which rested on a shelf high above the<br />\nmanagers desk, safe from the prying of vulgar<br />\neyes. Many a night I would see an A.M. bent<br />\nover his beloved rule book, beady eyes intent on<br />\nthe holy scripture, burning with the feverish fire<br />\nof a zealot.<br />\nDirectly over the slime beetles described<br />\n<br />\nabove were the store managers, for all intents<br />\nand purposes gentlemen of leisure. The work<br />\nthese people did was all cerebral, if I may stretch<br />\nthat term to the breaking point. The typical<br />\nstore manager's day consisted of eight hours of<br />\nanimated criticism of employees or discussions<br />\nof weighty taco politics with other bigwigs,<br />\ninterrupted by frequent meal and coffee breaks.<br />\nI only saw our store manager once-- on the day I<br />\nwas hired-- but I heard about her every day<br />\nwithout fail from then on. Each evening we<br />\nwould get a searing report on her opinion of our<br />\nwork the previous night. Invariably we were<br />\ninformed that she was one of the following:<br />\npissed off, teed off, really steamed, really boiled,<br />\nfed up, fit to be tied, on the warpath, on the rag,<br />\non the ragged edge, ready to scream, ready to<br />\nblow, madder than hell, madder than all hell,<br />\nor completely out of patience with our shoddy<br />\nperformance. She must have been great fun at<br />\nparties.<br />\nThe truth was that managers were not<br />\nencouraged to praise employees for anything at<br />\nanytime or to help them when the going got;<br />\nrough, because:\"such activities tend to blur the<br />\ndistinction between manager and employee and<br />\ncompromise the superior presence essential to all<br />\nmanagerial personnel.\" That's a direct quote<br />\nfrom the Big Book, son, and of such stuff was<br />\nthe day to day environment of good people<br />\nfashioned. Never a \"thank you\", never a \"job<br />\nwell done.\" Nothing to make the drone feel like<br />\nhe was part of a team, or laboring toward a<br />\ncommon goal. Of course there were some rare<br />\nmanagers who refused to toe that noxious line,<br />\nand actually acted like decent human beings.<br />\nThese were the people who got twice the work<br />\nout of their crews with half the problems, much<br />\nto the amazement and annoyance of the party<br />\nliners.<br />\nThe etherial realms above store manager<br />\nwere populated, for the most part, by mythical<br />\nbeings known only to the drones by their<br />\ncryptic monikers: \"Craig,\" \"Mr. Burns,\" and the<br />\napparently omnipotent \"Man From California.\"<br />\nThey sat, so we were told, in their palacial<br />\noffices on Olympus, playing medicine-ball with<br />\nthe planets and toppling governments with just a<br />\nscratch of their crotches. One of these Titans did<br />\ndescend into our midst for a while, though,<br />\nfurnishing an interesting comment on the<br />\nPaths to Taco Glory.<br />\nRick was the training manager for our area<br />\nwhich meant he spent a good portion of cad<br />\nday dealing with assistant managers-- which it<br />\nturn meant that he was bound to have a jaundi<br />\n<br />\n\fpitali\u00f1iBotuIisrn<br />\nBaldridge<br />\nsize of the potential labor pool for that sort of<br />\nunskilled work guarantees that no effective<br />\norganization of Fast Food peons will ever come<br />\nabout in the near future. The lack of such<br />\n\"constraints upon the market,\" far from producing the harmonious realtions between worker<br />\nand management which some of my libertarian<br />\npundits predicted, instead seemed to produce a<br />\nrampant pettiness and an attitiude of unconcern<br />\namong the managers, the like of which I had<br />\nnever imagined.<br />\nSome examples: In an attempt at cosmetic<br />\nsurgery, every franchise had a secret ceiling on<br />\n<br />\nced-eye view of life. He was a top shelf rotter all<br />\nright-- one of the worst. The man seemed to<br />\nexude malevolence whenever he stalked into<br />\nour store, eyes darting back and forth in a<br />\ntireless search for every slip-up those frightened<br />\nyoungsters were capable of making. He enjoyed<br />\nchewing people out-- the more minor the offense, the better. No matter how well a certain<br />\ntask was performed, he always managed to pull<br />\nsome niggling fault out of his black hat. He<br />\nmade no attempt to be likeable, and ruled by<br />\nfear alone.<br />\nIt happened that one night Rick had to<br />\ndrive me home, and when he found out that I<br />\nwas a college student, he suddenly felt obligated<br />\nto tell me his philosophy concerning the better<br />\nrunning of fast food establishments. \"I know<br />\nJerry's a nice guy,\" he said, \"but he just doesn't<br />\nhave the right attitude. And I know you think<br />\nJulie's a real nice lady, but she's just too slow<br />\nand I wish she wasn't working for me. Now I<br />\nknow you guys think Suzie's a real bitch, and I<br />\nguess she is, but she's a great little worker all the<br />\nsame.\"<br />\nDear God! I wanted to grab him around his<br />\nhamboned neck and shout: \"Don't you see a<br />\npattern there, chum? Don't you see that you've<br />\nset up a place in which nice people have no place<br />\nand only bastards can make the grade?\"<br />\nBut Rick went rattling on. He was a chicano, and he told me about how he had been<br />\nborn to an unwed mother in the barrio; how he<br />\nhad had to fight his way out of poverty; and<br />\nhow he had grabbed every opportunity that<br />\ncame his direction, no matter what it was. He<br />\ntold me about his upcoming promotion and how<br />\nhe felt that he had \"made it.\" Just before I got<br />\nout of the car, he mentioned something about<br />\ntrying to help his people back in the barrios, and<br />\nhow, for some strange reason he didn't understand, it was so hard to communicate with them<br />\nnow. Bad as he was, I actually felt sorry for the<br />\nheel at that moment. The poor guy didn't see<br />\nhow far down the road he'd strayed; how much<br />\nhe had come to put money ahead of people;<br />\nrules ahead of feelings; and expediency ahead<br />\nof caring. In short, Rick didn't realize just how<br />\nwhite he'd become.<br />\nThe impossibility of any kind of employee<br />\naction for the alleviation of grievances is an<br />\nobvious fact about Fast Food. Every drone in<br />\nthe country could get his pink slip tomorrow<br />\nand within a week the company could be back<br />\nto full strength, stuffing a hungry nation with<br />\nenchiladas once again. The youth and the<br />\nturnover rate of the employees, as well as the<br />\n<br />\nthe number of people who were supposed to be<br />\nfired each year. For this reason, drones unpopular with the managers had their hours cut and<br />\nwere then repeatedly harrassed in the hope<br />\nthat they- would quit \"voluntarily.\" One exceptionally nice fellow found his work-week reduced to a ludicrous five hours, and his religion<br />\nruthlessly mocked by whatever manager happened to be on duty during that miniscule shift.<br />\nWhen a timecard was submitted with any<br />\novertime on it, the paycheck was routinely<br />\nheld up by what was termed \"paperwork problems in California.\" When it finally arrived,<br />\ntwo to three weeks late, it was invariably made<br />\nout for only a regular forty hour week. Of<br />\ncourse by this time the drone involved was<br />\nusually so glad to finally get some amount of<br />\ngrocery money that seldom was a further protest<br />\nheard.<br />\nOne day during July I accidentally discovered a way of doing one of the many tasks<br />\nin a faster and more efficient way than that laid<br />\ndown in the mighty Book of Rules. One of<br />\nthe assistant managers spotted me and gave me a<br />\ndressing-down on the spot, which was a common<br />\nenough experience. The next day, however, I<br />\ncaught him doing it my way, and by weeks end<br />\nhe was chastizing other drones for not doing it<br />\nin the new manner. It wasn't long before the<br />\nmanagers were swearing up and down that the<br />\nnew way was the way it had always been done,<br />\never since the first primitive burrito crawled out<br />\nof the primevil sea to spawn upon the land.<br />\nThe best piece of textbook exploitation,<br />\nhowever, concerned cash register over-rings:<br />\nthose inevitable mistakes which occur when<br />\ndrunken customers change their order after<br />\nyou've already rung it up. According to the<br />\nBook of Rules, the amount of money in the cash<br />\nregister had to agree exactly with the amount<br />\nshown on the receipt tape at the end of the day.<br />\nAt first the managers were content with verbal<br />\nchastizements directed at those whose registers<br />\ncame up \"short,\" but such permissive behaviour<br />\nwas not destined to last. California was displeased--we had come up short too many times.<br />\nOne day in August it was announced that<br />\neveryone who wound up short would have to<br />\npay the difference out of their own pocket.<br />\nFor people who brought home less than S18.00<br />\na day after taxes, it was nothing short of robbery. This was the pinto bean that ripped the<br />\ntortilla's back. I told them I had no intention of<br />\npaying their punitive fine and if they didn't like<br />\nit they could get another taco stuffer and<br />\nstuff their tacos. The kingpins fussed and fumed<br />\nabout insubordination, but I just didn't care<br />\nanymore. Not a penny would they take from<br />\nmy already unimpressive paycheck. As I remember, I got drunk that night and saw the<br />\nghost of Sir Thomas More. (Luckilly, one of the<br />\ndrones possessing a more practical nature called<br />\n<br />\nthe D.A's office and got the blatantly illegal<br />\npractice stopped in its tracks.)<br />\nI could go on and on with examples like<br />\nthese, but I'm sure that by now the general<br />\npicture is apparent. Fast Food sucks...and I'm<br />\ntalking about more than just the taste.<br />\nIt is rather ironic that the pot-bellied Elks<br />\nand Kiwanas on America's chambers of commerce always greet a new Fast Food franchise<br />\nwith open arms and open bottles of scotch, for<br />\nthere is surely no institution capable of turning<br />\nteenagers against everything they stand for faster<br />\nthan Fast Food. It produces, for the most part,<br />\npeople whose first work experience has been<br />\nentirely negative; people who have gotten<br />\nnothing for their labor but abuse and a few<br />\nshekels; people whose introduction into American business has left them disenchanted, disheartened, and angry.<br />\nSo much for the proles. The sad thing<br />\nabout the managers was that they were all<br />\nso young. No one in any position of authority<br />\nin the company was over twenty-eight years old,<br />\nincluding the district manager. Yet they manifested attitudes I had come to expect from<br />\npeople much much older than they. Such blind<br />\nobedience to something so shabby at such an<br />\nearly age is doubly sad...and doubly frightening.<br />\nIt just seemed to me that they had all given up<br />\nthe fight much too soon.<br />\nWe do many things almost unconciously,<br />\none of which is to stop in at a Fast Food joint<br />\nfor a burger, a taco, or whatever. It can't even<br />\nbe called a meal, really--just a motorized, mechanized fuel stop on the way to somewhere else.<br />\nMy point is this: that meal which gets placed<br />\nbefore you gets there so easily and so swiftly<br />\nonly because somebody (probably everybody)<br />\nbehind the counter is getting the shaft in a big<br />\nway. There are no hassles to buying fast food<br />\nbecause hassles are the normal results of human<br />\ninteraction, and Fast Food tries to minimize the<br />\nhuman element in every facet of its operation.<br />\nIf the managers had their druthers, most of their<br />\noperation would be mechanized--or at least<br />\n<br />\n.s<br />\nthe proles' part of. You see, the managers and<br />\nassistant managers just .couldn't be replaced by<br />\ncircuitry, for as of now no one has devised a way<br />\nto make a machine act like an asshole.<br />\nI don't know if I've altered my political<br />\nleanings to any great degree as a result of this<br />\nvery instructive summer, but certain things have<br />\nchanged. I'm more skeptical now of any ideology which claims superiority only by virtue of<br />\nhow good it 'ooks on paper. From now on,<br />\nbefore I take up any banners, I want to see how<br />\nit works in practice on a very small, interpersonal basis: I want to see what it does<br />\nfor-or to-the drones.<br />\n<br />\n\f5t<br />\n<br />\ni _;),Ivc/<br />\n(.1<br />\nPAGE 12/ SEPTEMBER 14, 1979<br />\n<br />\nN-L<br />\nCLASSIFIEDS<br />\n<br />\nANIMAL commtess<br />\n<br />\nme COMM ACT<br />\n<br />\nTuesday<br />\n8:30<br />\n<br />\nFri.!Sat.<br />\n<br />\n$3admission<br />\n<br />\n$3 admission<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nCEJ\u00b0 if 1<br />\nHAIRCUT - SHAMPOO & CONDITION $7.50 for Men, Women, &<br />\nChildren WITH THIS AD.

The skit ends with a fifteensecond blackout, then two men appear on<br />\nthe stage to do a spot for \"Penis Weave\",<br />\na racy parody of Baltimore's ever-popular<br />\n\"Mr. Ray's Hair Weave\" commercial.<br />\nAnd so it goes.<br />\nIs this Saturday Night Live? Monty<br />\nPython? Second City? None of the<br />\nabove? Since the beginning of May,<br />\nBaltimore has been blessed with potentially the finest crew of motley scumbags<br />\nthis side of a John Waters Christmas<br />\nparty, legitimized under the name Animal<br />\n<br />\nCrackers. Under the direction of Steven<br />\nA. Libowitz, the six-member troupe of<br />\nLinda Rae Favila, John Kassir, Jerry<br />\nMaglio, Marie Marciano, Jeff Marder, and<br />\nLarry Schwartz has had to turn away<br />\nbetween 50 and 200 people at the door<br />\nfrom each of their Friday and Saturday<br />\nmidnight shows in the tiny Bolton Hill<br />\nDinner Theatre.<br />\nLibowitz is astounded by the turnout. \"We had no idea, when we began,<br />\nwhether or not the city would support us.<br />\nOur philosophy was, and is, that the<br />\nBaltimore audience has been subjected to<br />\nyears of New York and California humor,<br />\nbetween television and the movies. Since<br />\ncomedy ultimately deals with the truth,<br />\nand since all of us in Animal Crackers are<br />\nfrom the area, we felt that Baltimoreans<br />\nmight be receptive to us and our jokes<br />\nabout the city.\"<br />\nAnd receptive they were. Tuesday's<br />\nshow, a selection of the \"Best of Animal<br />\nCrackers\" from the past four months,<br />\ndrew uncontrollable laughter from the<br />\naudience. In fact, during the blackout<br />\n<br />\nfollowing a satirized advertisement for<br />\n\"The Maryland National Sperm Bank,\" in<br />\nwhich John Kassir was making a night<br />\ndeposit into something called \"Harvey<br />\nBallbanger,\" I thought I noticed someone<br />\nrushing off with a bursting bladder to<br />\nrelieve himself.<br />\nAnimal Crackers' members were<br />\nchosen from public auditions held last<br />\nApril. The six chosen turned out to be<br />\nstudents from Towson StateandUniversity<br />\nof Maryland, Baltimore Campus. Libowitz casually contends that his group has<br />\nan advantage over the cast of Saturday<br />\nNight Live, whose players are constantly at each other's throats backstage. The<br />\nBaltimore group shares the best of<br />\nfeelings between its members. There are<br />\nother important differences between the<br />\ntwo: Animal Crackers is under no<br />\nrestriction from the Federal Communications Commission and is therefore free to<br />\nstage a no-holds-barred show, whereas a<br />\nnationally televised program like Saturday Night Live must obviously shy away<br />\nfrom regionalism, where Animal Crackers<br />\nuses regional comedy as its mainstay.<br />\nOverall, the quality of the writing is<br />\nvery good; 90% of the time it is right<br />\non the mark. Only in the longer skits was<br />\nthe humor difficult to sustain. According<br />\nto Libowitz, the cast members do most of<br />\nthe writing, although outside scripts are<br />\nalso accepted. Many of the scripts are<br />\nwritten for certain ensemble members;<br />\nmany are written in the process of<br />\nworking out the idea. Usually the group<br />\nbegins performing a skit three weeks from<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br />\n<br />\nBreaking Away:<br />\nA Tour de Force<br />\nBY CLIFF HARRIS<br />\nDave Stoller, the bicycle-pedaling<br />\nteen-ager in Breaking Away, seems<br />\nnormal enough on the surface; he's just<br />\nout of high school, without a job or any<br />\nparticular plans for the future, and tends<br />\nto hang out with his three buddies, Mike,<br />\nMoocher, and Cyril at an abandoned<br />\nstone quarry in his town of Bloomington,<br />\nIndiana. But contrary to the soft, lazy<br />\nmood evoked in the film's opening<br />\nsequence, Dave is strongly driven. Obsessed with bicycling, he rides as often as<br />\npossible, pampering his ten-speeder the<br />\nway other boys his age fuss over hot rods.<br />\nBut Dave's obsession doesn't stop there;<br />\nhe is madly infatuated with Italy, the<br />\nhome of the world's top cyclists, and<br />\ndoes everything possible to transform<br />\nhimself into a true Italian, from adopting<br />\nwhat he likes to think is an Italian accent<br />\nto naming his cat Fellini and feeding him<br />\nHe even<br />\nfrom a Cinzano ashtray.<br />\nexperiences Italian romance, falling in<br />\nlove with a dark-haired sorority girl from<br />\nlocal Indiana Unviersity and passing<br />\nhimself off as an Italian exchange student.<br />\nDave's father, played with superb<br />\nbefuddlement and impatience by Paul<br />\nDooley, doesn't exactly approve of his<br />\nson's \"eye-talian\" inclinations. He is a<br />\ntrue-blue middle American, from his<br />\nclip-on tie down to his pot-belly, and is<br />\nsincerely proud of his beginnings as a<br />\nhard-working stonecutter in the local<br />\nlimestone quarries. Much of the film's<br />\nhumor derives from Dooley's confused,<br />\nbrow-knitting reactions to his son's<br />\nItalian opera records, his greeting of<br />\n\"Ciao, Poppa!\" and his ever-thickening<br />\naccent. Mr. Stoller simply can't compre-<br />\n<br />\nhend why his Son would be interested in<br />\nanything besides french fries, used cars,<br />\nand limestone. However, Dave's mother,<br />\nsensitively protrayed by Barbara Barrie,<br />\nsympathizes with her son's attraction to<br />\nItaly; although she has relatively little to<br />\nsay, the warm, knowing look in her eyes<br />\nsuggests that she realizes, unlike her<br />\nobstinate husband, that their lives could<br />\nuse a dash or two of romance.<br />\nDennis Christopher, as Dave, and<br />\nDennis Quaid, Daniel Stern, and Jackie<br />\nEarl Haley as his friends, all give excellent, convincing performances, while<br />\ncarefully avoiding pretention or showi\u2014<br />\nness. As they are relatively unknown,<br />\nunfamiliar faces, they are well suited to 1,<br />\nSteve Tesich's screenplay, which is a s<br />\nmarvelous example of skillful understatement and restraint. Using characters<br />\nand situations that often border on<br />\nstereotype or cliche, Tesich does not<br />\nallow himself to go too far, and maintains<br />\nfull, genuine individuals without sacrificing comedy. The antagonism between<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nthe fraternity members at the local<br />\ncollege and the four boys, who feel<br />\nIt takes a mean man to hate a<br />\nthreatened and frustrated by the academ-- little muppet--especially a muppet as<br />\nic environment on campus, is a real charming and personable as Kermit the<br />\nand felt conflict, in spite of occasional Frog. But that's exactly what Doc Hoptendencies toward slapstick. Mocked by per, a fast-food frog-legs entrepreneur,<br />\nthe college community, which calls them manages to do. Having caught Kermit's<br />\n\"cutters\" because of their working class, act at the Sleez-O Cafe, Hopper chases<br />\nquarry origins, the boys, except for Dave, our hero and his merry band all the way<br />\nare further united by their resentment. to Hollywood where they evade him and<br />\nPeter Yates, the film's director, fulfill their dreams of screen stardom and<br />\nrecognized as a master of the auto-chase live happily ever after in a world of love<br />\ngenre for his direction of \"Bullit,\" makes and rainbows.<br />\noptimum use of chase and race footage.<br />\nThough the plot of The Muppet<br />\nThe pacing, one of the film's finest Movie, like Sesame Street where it<br />\nfeatures, is carefully babences so that the originated, is designed for kids, the movie<br />\nnarrative neither floats along airily and should entertain anyone who likes a little<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br />\nfantasy and magic. The soft rock music<br />\n<br />\nMuppets A Must<br />\nand theatrical backdrops set the film's<br />\nlight tone as do the innocuous gags and<br />\npractical jokes.

According to Fink, the<br />\nnew constitution has better<br />\nchecks and balances over spending.<br />\nFink also stated that the<br />\nconstitution had not been passed<br />\nlast year because of the SAC's<br />\ninability to get a quorum at a<br />\nmeeting to vote on it even<br />\nthough they tried several times.<br /><br />\nBaltimore City Fair Open<br />\nBY BARBARA BUSHARIS<br />\nThe 10th annual Baltimore<br />\nCity Fair, scheduled to run from<br />\nnoon today to 10 p.m. on<br />\nSunday, will offer a wide variety<br />\nof events. Close to 80 neighborhoods will be represented, and a<br />\nlarge number of other organizations and businesses will also be<br />\npresent. The fair, which commemorates the city's 250th<br />\nanniversary, has another historical dimension: it will take place<br />\non the 165th anniversary of the<br />\nwriting of Francis Scott Key's<br />\n\"The Star Spangled Banner.\"<br />\nThe idea of having a city<br />\nfair was conceived in response to<br />\nthe tension that arose in<br />\nBaltimore during the late 1960's.<br />\nAt that time, the Fair was seen<br />\nas a way to bring people together by showcasing the various<br />\nethnic and neighborhood groups<br />\nwithin Baltimore. It is not<br />\nactually sponsored by the city<br />\ngovernment, but by a volunteer<br />\ncorporation. Most of the work<br />\ninvolved in planning and hosting<br />\nthe fair is done by volunteers,<br />\nwhose activities are supplemented by a small paid staff.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has participated actively in the Fair since it<br />\nwas first held in 1970. At that<br />\ntime Dea Andersen Kline, now<br />\nDirector of Community Affairs<br />\nat the University, pledged Hopkins' help in recruiting and<br />\norganizing non-profit groups for<br />\nthe Fair. Kline is participating<br />\nin this year's opening ceremonies, where she will present<br />\nMayor William Schaefer with a<br />\nreproduction of one of the first<br />\nedition copies of \"The Star<br />\nSpangled Banner.\" The facsimile will also be distributed to<br />\nwho attend the<br />\nfairgoers<br />\nHopkins exhibit.<br />\nAt 2 p.m. on Friday, the<br />\nMayor and the Senior Alumni<br />\nwill participate in an 80th<br />\nbirthday salute to President<br />\nEmeritus Milton S. Eisenhower.<br />\nOther Hopkins activities include<br />\na videotape on a newly-developed power-assisted wheelchair and<br /><br />\nmedical manipulator, presented<br />\nby the Applied Physics Laboratory (Friday and Sunday from<br />\nnoon to 7 p.m.; Saturday from<br />\n10 a.m. to 7 p.m.); a presentation<br />\nof \"The Wonderful World of<br />\nMaterials\" by Professors Robert<br />\nE. Green and Robert B. Pond of<br />\nthe Whiting School of Engineering (Saturday and Sunday,1 to 2<br />\np.m.); and demonstrations of<br />\ncardio-pulmonary resuscitation<br />\n(CPR) by the University's<br />\nEmergency Medicine Department (Saturday and Sunday,<br />\n2 to 4 p.m.). Also, a children's<br />\n\"percussion workshop\", sponsored by the Peabody Institute,<br />\nwill be held from 10 a.m. to<br />\nnoon on Saturday.<br />\nVolunteers from all areas<br />\nof the Hopkins community will<br />\nbe present to greet fairgoers,<br />\nhost the Hopkins exhibit, and<br />\ndistribute materials on the Evening College, Summer Session and<br />\ngood health rules. There will be<br />\nnurse recruiting from 10 a.m. to<br />\nnoon on Saturday. Kline sees the<br />\nHopkins exhibit as a means for<br />\nmembers of the different divisions of Johns Hopkins to<br />\nbecome familiar with one another, in much the same way<br />\nthat the fair itself helps people<br /><br />\nfrom the different communities<br />\nin Baltimore to become acquainted and overcome their differences.<br />\nA large number of the<br />\nactivities at the Fair will be<br />\nsponsored by the neighborhood<br />\nand civic groups: games, rides,<br />\nfood stands, and local craftsmen<br />\nwill all be a part of the entertainment. In addition, there will<br />\nbe four large stages at the Fair<br />\nthat will feature \"name\" entertainers. One of these, the Main<br />\nStage, will offer the following<br />\nacts: The Baltimore Symphony<br />\n(Friday, 8 p.m.); Marilyn McCoo<br />\nand Billy Davis Jr. (Saturday, 8<br />\np.m.); and Diahann Carroll<br />\n(Sunday, 8 p.m.). A special<br />\nattraction on Saturday afternoon will be Doug Jones'<br />\nattempt to set a high-diving<br />\nrecord by diving from a 170-foot<br />\ncrane into the Inner Harbor.<br />\nThe event will receive national<br />\nmedia<br />\nattention, including<br />\ncoverage by Wide World of<br />\nSports.<br />\nThe finale of the Fair will<br />\ntake place at 9:30 p.m. Sunday,<br />\nwhen there will be a fireworks<br />\ndisplay over the water at the<br />\nInner Harbor.<br /><br />\nBaltimore's City Fair, the largest of its kind, takes place<br />\nthis weekend at the recently renovated inner harbor area.<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nstaged by students. Their main<br />\nobjection was that the Code did<br />\nnot define the University's jurisdiction clearly enough.<br />\nThe Code defines academic offenses as those which<br />\n\"constitute direct or material<br />\ndamage and/or 'threats to the<br />\nhealth, safety or property of the<br />\nmembers of the University<br />\ncommunity or damage to the<br />\nphysical facilities of the University, and occur on University<br />\nproperty or arise from the<br />\nstudent's affiliation with the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nLoebel said that her committee will concentrate on drafting a code specific enough to<br />\nprotect both University and<br />\nstudent interests. \"It's a very<br />\ndifficult problem to strike that<br />\nbalance, to protect everybody,\"<br />\nshe said. Loebel also plans<br />\nto reexamine the positions assigned to University administrators in the adjudication process.<br />\nHarry Lerner, one of last<br />\nyear's objectors to the Code,<br />\nrecently made this statement:<br />\n\"We need not just elaborate<br />\nrules of disciplinary procedure,<br />\nbut the substantial protection of<br />\nexplicit limits on\u2022 the University's authority. Anything less<br />\nonly legitimizes the administration's arbitrary powers.<br />\n\"Unfortunately, the leading figures on the Student<br />\nCouncil are the same students<br />\nwho endorsed last year's proposal by the Council, which was<br /><br />\ndefeated by student referendum.<br />\nAt least one member has said<br />\nthat the same version should be<br />\nresubmitted this year.\"<br />\nThe Code will deal only<br />\nwith non-academic offenses.<br />\nThe Ethics Board will continue<br />\nto handle academic problems.<br />\nUnder the system proposed in<br />\nthe most recent draft of the<br />\nCode, The Director of Student<br />\nServices will certify a charge<br />\n(since that position has been<br />\neliminated, this duty will be<br />\nreassigned). The fudent can<br />\nchoose to have hii case' heard<br />\nby either a Dean cof student<br />\nhearing panel. The five-member<br />\npanel will be selected from a<br />\nBoard<br />\nJudicial<br />\n10-member<br />\nchosen by the Council.<br />\nThe student can choose to<br />\nhave his case made public or<br />\nFour of the<br />\nkept private.<br />\nfive members of the panel must<br />\nvote guilty for a conviction.<br />\nUpon conviction the panel recommends a punishment to the<br />\nDean of Homewood Faculties.<br />\nThe dean, however, does not<br />\nhave to follow that recommendation.<br />\nThe Code also sets up<br />\nprocedures for rehearings. If<br />\nnew evidence in a case is discovered, the student may have his<br />\ncase redetermined within 15 days<br />\nof notifying the University.<br />\nAppeals are directed to the<br />\nProvost. If the punishment was<br />\nexpulsion or suspension. he may<br />\nappeal to the President after<br />\ngoing to the Provost.<br /><br />\nTutorial Program<br />\nBY LINDSAY KAPLAN<br />\nFall on the Homewood<br />\nCampus manifests itself in many<br />\nforms, not the least familiar<br />\nof which is the inundation of<br />\nLevering Hall with many small,<br />\nenergetic individuals armed with<br />\nbooks, papers and pencils.<br />\nThese persons are not, as one<br />\nmight suspect, members of the<br />\nnewly matriculated freshman<br />\nclass; in actuality they are<br />\nstudents from Baltimore public<br />\nschools between the ages of six<br />\nand 12 participating in the Johns<br />\nHopkins Tutorial Project.<br />\nThe Project, sponsored by<br />\nthe Chaplain's office, organizes<br />\narea college and high school<br />\nstudent volunteers to tutor<br />\nchildren who need help in<br />\nmath on a<br />\nreading and<br />\none-on-one basis. The volunteers spend a total of three hours<br />\neach week (two 90-minute sessions) with their tutees on the<br />\nHopkins Campus, in an efiort to<br />\nimprove the child's basic skills<br />\nwhile making the learning experience an enjoyable one.<br />\nThis year the Tutorial Project is being run by Ralph<br />\nSanchez (replacing former director David Fishkin) along with<br />\nAssistant Directors Douglas<br />\nBoardman and Anne Hirsch.<br />\nSanchez, described the program's one-to-one tutoring situation as \"unique, because it<br />\nprovides a personal element that<br />\ngives kids the individual attention they might not normally get<br /><br />\nin school.\" He feels that this<br />\nindividual focus makes up for<br />\nthe relatively short time that the<br />\nstudents actually spend with<br />\ntheir tutors. The fact that they<br />\nare taught on the Hopkins<br />\nCampus brings the children into<br />\ncontact with new and stimulating aspects of education such as<br />\nexploring the laboratories and<br />\ncomputer rooms -- an experience<br />\nmany of them would not normally get.<br />\nOther changes besides administrative ones are either<br />\nplanned or have already taken<br />\nplace. The Project has applied<br />\nfor a Federal Grant through the<br />\nprogram (Reading Is<br />\nFundamental) which supplies<br />\nmatching funds for the purchase<br />\nof books.

Yes, even you S. &amp; B.S.<br />\nmajors will have to \u2014 sorry, there's just no avoiding it.<br />\nThis year, however, a new treat awaits you on freshly-carpeted M Level which should make the trip a bit more<br />\ninteresting.<br />\nAt first we had some difficulty in divining the purpose<br />\nof the Library's new \"Tattletape\" (what a cute name)<br />\nBook-Theft Detector. This electronic Sam Spade cost a<br />\ncool ten G's and certainly appears threatening enough \u2014<br />\nbut it was the usefulness of this new toy that had us<br />\nbaffled. It certainly couldn't have been installed in order<br />\nto save any money, because it's obvious that even if it<br />\nbecomes 100% effective (don't hold your breath) there<br />\nwill still have to be at least one guard on duty to check<br />\nincoming IDs, stop malefactors who set off the beeper<br />\nand tell those with luminous watch dials to setp back and<br />\ngo through again without them.<br />\nDid the Library spend all that money just to make M<br />\nLevel look like an airport concourse? We thought so at<br />\nfirst, but after a little pondering the real answer became<br />\napparent. Since the system operates by emitting microwaves, it must exist for the sole purpose of killing those<br />\nLibrary patrons who wear electronic pacemakers. We can<br />\nsee the Library's point readily enough. After all, the old<br />\ngeezers are living on borrowed time, and it must be a huge<br />\nannoyance to have to drag them up out of the stacks when<br />\nthey kick the bucket on D Level. This dandy new machine<br />\nplants'em at the door, where body removal is considerably<br />\neasier.<br />\nThe point is that the new machine is merely window<br />\ndressing: it looks impressive and costs a lot of dough,(our<br />\ndough, don't forget,) but it doesn't contribute to the<br />\ntruely important business of the University. A library with<br />\nten thousand dollars worth of additional books is far<br />\nsuperior to one which can qualify for admission to the Air<br />\n&amp; Space Museum by virtue of its fancy hardware.<br />\nThis attitude of putting appearance ahead of substance<br />\nis by no means confined to the Library \u2014 rather, it is<br />\ncampus wide. This same type of fuzzy thinking produced<br />\nsuch marvels as the Great Wall of Hopkins -- that meandering structure on the campus' southern fringe. Not only is<br />\nit expensive and strictly for show (who is it supposed to<br />\nkeep out...or in?,) but it looks as though it was designed<br />\nby someone who was enjoying his twelth martini at the<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe next time this University's money moguls find<br />\nthemselves in the possession of a little mad money, why<br />\ndon't they consider spending it to keep on a professor or<br />\ntwo, or upgrade some laboratory equipment? It is the<br />\nsubstance of a school which makes it a quality institution,<br />\nnot the amount of ivy on the walls, and even Hopkins<br />\ncannot afford to waste money on paltry cosmetics. Remember boys, beauty is only skin deep.<br /><br />\n-Sot<br /><br />\no<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n0.<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\n,,/<br /><br />\nt4 \u2022 '<br /><br />\n11 \u2022 i \u2022<br />\nNis 4<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n..Ary<br /><br />\nDr. Steven Muller's<br />\nrespect for art is equaled only<br />\nby his knowledge of the names<br />\nand faces of every undergraduate<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nThe university<br />\npossesses some of the finest art<br />\ncollections in the United States,<br />\nbut how does the administration<br />\nshow its appreciation of these<br />\ncultural treasures? By selling<br />\nthem, that's how.<br />\nParts of the highly-esteemed Garrett coin collection<br />\nare being sold. The Gilmor<br />\ndrawings, another first-rate<br />\nHopkins-owned collection, will<br />\nlikewise be put on the auctioneer's block. I certainly would<br />\nnot deny the university its right<br />\nto sell anything it owns; rather, I<br />\nquestion the reasoning behind<br />\nthe sale of these art works.<br />\nHopkins officials claim<br />\nthe university needs some quick<br />\ncash, ostensibly for the impecunious Peabody Conservatory.<br />\nGranted, these are inflationary<br />\ntimes, but a well-heeled institution like Hopkins can hardly he<br /><br />\nstrapped for bucks, can it? If<br />\nfunds are needed to bail out any<br />\ndivision of the university, then<br />\nsurely the money can be raised<br />\nsome way other than by selling<br />\nthe Garrett coins and the Gilmor<br />\ndrawings.<br />\nPerhaps university<br />\nofficials just find this an easy<br />\nand convenient method. That<br />\nkind of \"garage sale\" mentality<br />\nmay be permissible in suburban<br />\nhousewives, but not in the<br />\nadministrators of a renowned<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nMoreover, Dr. Muller<br />\nmust realize the worth of the<br />\ncollections to art historians and<br />\nother scholars (many of which,<br />\nincidentally, can often be found<br />\non the JHU campus.) Hopkins is<br />\na business, but above and<br />\nbeyond all else, it is in the<br />\nbusiness of education.<br />\nLastly, these collections<br />\nwere intended by their donors to<br />\nedify and give pleasure to<br />\nthe citizens of Baltimore. Dr.<br />\nMuller would do well to keep<br />\nthat in mind before he goes<br />\npeddling the Garrett coins, the<br />\nGilmor drawings, the Peabody<br /><br />\npaintings, the Evergreen House,<br />\nor anything else the university<br />\nhappens to own by way of<br />\ninheritance. (In defense of the<br />\nsales, Dr. Muller has stated that<br />\nHopkins has neither the funds to<br />\ninsure these various art collections nor the space to exhibit<br />\nthem properly \u2014 other pressing<br />\nmatters, of course, come first,<br />\nsuch as paying the electric bill<br />\nfor the Mudd Building. Local<br />\nmuseum curators, who are outraged over the possible loss of<br />\nthe collections, would be all too<br />\nhappy to take them on loan<br />\nfrom the university and exhibit<br />\nthem at the Walters Art Gallery<br />\nor the Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nAt least that way they would remain<br />\nin Baltimore, where they belong.<br />\nHad Baltimore's late art<br />\ncollectors foreseen that Hopkins<br />\nwould someday have an avid<br />\nart fan like Steve Muller as<br />\npresident, then they might have<br />\nbequeathed their treasures to<br />\nsome school that would have<br />\nbeen more appreciative -- like,<br />\nsay, Towson State University<br />\nor Essex Community College.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nFrosh<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWith all due respect to the<br />\nnewswriters of last week's article<br />\non Freshmen Orientation, I feel<br />\nthat some of the things I was<br />\nquoted as saying may have been<br />\nill-timed, poorly stated or<br />\nmisinterpreted.<br />\nFirst off, when I said, \"If<br />\nit wasn't for my low budget and<br />\nmy social committee,everything<br />\nwould have gone great\" I meant.<br />\nno slur against the committee On<br />\ntheir overall effort and performance. As a matter of fact, I feel<br />\nthe committee( Audrey Zettich,<br />\nBruce Karner and Amy Caplan)<br />\ndid an excellent job, and each<br />\nsocial event was well planned for<br />\nand very well executed (problems occurring during any of the<br />\nevents were by no means the<br />\nfault of the committee). I was<br />\namazed at how well put together<br />\nthe social calendar for the week<br />\nhad been set-up, especially in the<br />\ntime they took. My comment<br />\nwas taken out of context. It did<br />\nexpress my feelings in mid-July<br />\nwhen I had a million things on<br />\nmy mind,and social planning for<br />\nOrientation hadn't begun, but it<br />\nDOES NOT reflect my opinion<br />\nof their performance, and furthermore, Amy does deserve an<br />\nawful lot of credit for what she<br />\ndid.<br />\nMy second point of correction is where Karl Block<br />\nasked the social committee to<br /><br />\ntake over financial management.<br />\nI was not present when Karl<br />\nspoke to the other committee<br />\nmembers so I could only speculate as to what went on while I<br />\nwas away. I left some things to<br />\nbe done in my absence, and I do<br />\nknow that the committee got<br />\ntogether, but I honestly can't<br />\nknow what was said at the time.<br />\nMy other comments such<br />\nas those on \"personality conflicts\" and \"the group not<br />\nworking well together\" also<br />\nseemed to be out of place.<br />\nPersonality conflicts are to be<br />\ntaken for granted since people<br />\nwho normally aren't \"in the<br />\nsame group\" can't be expected<br />\nto become friends with other<br />\npeople just because they happened to have been picked to<br />\nwork together on a school<br />\ncommittee. The committee not<br />\nworking well together seems to<br />\nbe contradicted by the fact that<br />\nOrientation was such a success.<br />\nYes, we made mistakes, and<br />\nsometimes disagreed, but we're<br />\nonly human, and are subject to<br />\nerror and changes in disposition.<br />\nOnce again I thank everyone on my committee and<br />\nextend my apologies to those<br />\noffended by my comments of<br />\nlast week. If there are still any<br />\nquestions about what I may have<br />\nmeant or the context of anything else I said, I'm willing to<br />\ndiscuss them with the offended<br />\nparties.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nFrannie Garfinkel<br /><br />\nReFrosh<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe recent article on<br />\nfreshmen orientation was very<br />\nunfair to all of the people who<br />\ncame through and worked so<br />\nhard to make orientation a<br />\nsuccess. The weekly News-Letter<br />\nis not the place to discuss the<br />\n\"dirty laundry\" of committee<br />\nmembers, but to emphasize the<br />\nenjoyment of the activities of<br />\norientation week. It seems to me<br />\nthat the issue of personality<br />\nconflicts, ego trips and money<br />\nproblems are everyday occurences. Orientation comes around<br />\nbut once a year. After everyone<br />\nhas experienced a week of hassle<br />\nfree fun, why is a negative<br />\nattitude<br />\ndisplayed<br />\ntoward<br />\nfreshman Orientation?<br />\nFor a committee that<br />\nwasn't doing anything, there<br />\nsure seemed to be a lot of<br />\nsocializing going on.<br />\nAmy Caplan<br />\nSocial Director<br /><br />\nMs. Caplan 'S objections show<br />\nthat she misunderstood the<br />\ntheme of the article and the<br />\nreasons for describing the problems the Committee faced.<br />\nAs set forth in the second<br />\nparagraph, the article sets up<br />\na contrast between the success<br />\nof the program (as indicated<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 5<br /><br />\nNew Student Assistant;<br />\nMarshal Salant Interview ,<br />\nBY MARK TRACHTEN BERG<br /><br />\nSenior Marshal Salant has<br />\nbeen appointed Student Assistant to Associate Dean of<br />\nHomewood Faculties Jakie Hall.<br />\nHe will perform a wide variety<br />\nof duties, including the preparation of a comprehensive evaluation of student services, conducting a survey of student housing<br />\nneeds and preferences, and acting as ombudsman with the<br />\nAdministration for student concerns. Salant will also aid the<br />\nSecretary for the Board of<br />\nTrustees, and will help the<br />\nMetro Center coordinate the<br />\nINternational Fellows program<br />\nwhich brings foreign urban<br />\nspecialists to the U.S. to study<br />\nand exchange information about<br />\ncity problems.<br />\nSalant emphasized that he<br />\ndoes not want to encroach upon<br />\nthe role of the Student Council.<br />\n\"George Connolly is a fine guy,\"<br />\nhe said, \"but there are always a<br />\nnumber of projects which the<br />\nS.C. simply doesn't have time to<br />\npursue.\" He cited as an example<br />\nthe Class of '79 Memorial<br />\nScholarship Fund, which Stuart<br />\nDavidson, last year's Student<br />\nAssistant, played a major role in<br />\nsetting up.<br />\nSalant also does not want to<br />\nact or be seen as a barrier<br />\nbetween other students and the<br />\nAdministration. \"Jakie really<br />\ntries to be accessible, really<br />\nwants to hear directly what's<br />\nbugging students. But if for<br /><br />\nsome reason you can't find him<br />\nor you feel uncomfortable about<br />\ntalking to an administrator, you<br />\nshould come to me.\"<br />\nSalant has a long history of<br />\ninvolvement in student activities.<br />\nHe has served as a Student<br />\nCouncil REpresentative, directed<br />\nthe 1979 Spring Fair, and is<br />\ncurrently the housemaster of<br />\nWilson-Wood. \"I've always felt<br />\nthat the wily way to improve<br />\nlife at Hopkins is to get involved<br />\nwith the Administration and<br /><br />\nvoice our concerns,\" Salant<br />\nsaid. \"I suppose I feel a duty to<br />\ndo it, but i'm certainly no<br />\nmartyr. I really enjoy running<br />\nevents, and the administrative<br />\nexperience is very important,<br />\nsince I plan to go to business<br />\nschool.\"<br />\nAs a Mathematical Sciences<br />\nmajor, Salant feels that not<br />\nbeing pre-med br pre-law gives<br />\nhim more time for extracurricular activities. \"Besides,\" he<br />\nadds, \"I never have been the<br />\ntype to spend a huge amount of<br /><br />\ntime studying. What I did for<br />\nSpring Fair was far more valuable to me than any of my<br />\nclasses. I wouldn't have been<br />\nable to enjoy it so much otherwise.\"<br />\nSalant believes that the<br />\nnotorious apathy of Hopkins<br />\nstudents can be overcome: \"It's<br />\npointless to sit in your room,<br />\nbitching about how nobody<br />\ncares. I made it a point to get<br />\npeople who had never been<br />\nactive (in student organizations)<br />\nbefore involved in Spring Fair.<br />\nWe had 60 people on the Fair<br />\nCommittee, where the year<br />\nbefore it had been 12. The wider<br />\ninvolvement helped make it a<br />\nsuccess.<br />\n\"But it's true that it's<br />\nharder to get the mass of students involved than it was in<br />\nhigh school. The woi-kload is<br />\nmuch greater, and a lot of<br />\npeople who did stuff in high<br />\nschool just stick to the books<br />\nhere. And of the people who are<br />\ninvolved, too many of them are<br />\ninto rhetoric. Politicians-in-training. They'll go on and on<br />\nabout how we have an ethical<br />\nobligation to do something when<br />\nthe only relevant issge is whether we can afford it. I stress<br />\npracticality and finances, not<br />\nmoral crusades.<br />\n\"So it's easy to see how<br />\nsomeone might have a gripe, but<br />\nbe completely turned off on the<br />\npossibliity of doing something<br />\nabout it.

Guest<br />\nspeakers discuss social and political issues of current improtance.<br />\nSpeaking on \"Women's Rights in<br />\nthe Twentieth Century\" were<br />\nElisbeth Bothe, Associate Judge<br />\nof the Supreme Bench of<br />\nBaltimore City; Ann Wilson,<br />\nfamily sociologist at UMBC;and<br />\nEdyth Schoenrich, Associate<br />\nDean of the Hopkins School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health.<br /><br />\nAccording to Wilson, the<br />\nfundemental problem all working women face is the critical<br />\neconomic situation. Although<br />\nmore women are aorking, the<br />\nincome gap between males and<br />\nfemales is becoming wider. With<br />\nfewer jobs available and increasing numbers of applicants,<br />\n\"Women not only must be as<br />\ngood as men to be considered<br />\nfor a job-- but the qualifications<br />\nfor men are increasing.\"<br />\nWilson expressed concern<br />\nabout women in higher education. Though more women are<br />\nattending graduate and professional schools, the median number of years they spend in higher<br />\neducation is decreasing. She<br />\npointed out that the proportion<br />\nof women in academia has not<br />\nincreased since the 60's.<br /><br />\nBothe said that although<br />\nwomen in the professions are<br />\noften able through preferential<br />\ntreatment to advance more<br />\nrapidly than men, they \"have<br />\nnever been able to advance<br />\nthemselves on a par\" with other<br />\ndisadvantaged groups. She cited<br />\nas an example the success of the<br />\ncoordinated black movement in<br />\nBaltimore to create a demand<br />\nfor black lawyers. \"Now there<br />\naren't enough black lawyers to<br />\nmeet the demand or need,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nBothe said that without a<br />\ncohesive women's force to direct<br />\nits interpretation, ERA has most<br />\noften been used to benefit<br />\nmen. \"we now have male airline<br />\nstewardesses, men getting maternity leave, and shorter policemen,\" she said.<br />\nSchoenrich said that combining a career and a family was<br />\n\"Not Easy, and yet worth the<br />\neffort to do both.\" Bothe called<br />\nfor a men's consciousness-raising<br />\nrevolution. Wilson expressed her<br />\nhope for a sharing or roles<br />\nbetween men and women with<br />\nrespect to career and family.<br /><br />\nKen Kiesler<br />\nGlee Club Head<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Glee Club has a new<br />\nmusical director, its third in<br />\nas many years. Its previous<br />\ndirector, Hugh Wolff, left his<br />\npost at Hopkins to take on the<br />\nassistant conductorship of the<br />\nNational Symphony Orchestra in<br />\nWashington<br />\nD. C. under<br />\nRostapovich. Replacing Wolff is<br />\nKen Kiesler, who is also the<br />\nconductor of the Peabody Conservatory Chamber Orchestra,<br />\nChorus and Chamber Chorus, as<br />\nwell as being the Music Director<br />\nand Conductor of the Prince<br />\nGeorges County Philharmonic.<br />\nThis changeover seems to<br />\nhave had no disruptive effect on<br />\nthe choir whatsoever. Over 75<br />\nstudents showed up at the open<br />\nrehearsals held this past Monday<br />\n- practically double the size of<br />\nlast year's group, according to<br />\nchoir president Suber Huang.<br />\nWhile the first meeting of the<br /><br />\nTHE STROH BREWERY COMPANY, DETROIT, MICHIGAN \u00a9 1978<br /><br />\nGlee Club is usually a large one,<br />\nHuang believes that most of the<br />\nstudents who came to the<br />\nMonday rehearsal will remain in<br />\nthe choir.<br />\nMany of those<br />\npresent were former members<br />\nwho decided to rejoin the Club,<br />\nor graduate students who took<br />\npart in the organization while<br />\nHuang also<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nattributes the enlarged membership to the extensive recruiting<br />\ncampaign directed towards the<br />\nfreshman this year.<br />\nThe choir's program for<br />\nthe fall is as yet undertermined,<br />\nowing to the fact that Kiesler<br />\nwas hired just this past week.<br />\nHowever, Huang estimated that<br />\nthe Glee Club would perform<br />\nfour or five concerts this season,<br />\nprobably consisting of several<br />\nshort pieces accompanied by a<br />\nstring ensemble. Kiesler is open<br />\nto program suggestions at this<br />\npoint; and is hoping to cover a<br />\nlarge range of choral music including<br />\nBenjamin<br />\nBritten<br />\npieces, Poulenc motets, spirituals<br />\nand one larger, \"substantial\"<br />\nwork.<br /><br />\nVolunteer<br />\ncont. from p. 7<br />\nsistance, or helping take care of<br />\nthe family.<br />\nThe second program at<br />\nOffender Aid Restoration is a<br />\nthird-party custody arrangement.

A<br />\nvolunteer is assigned to each<br />\nprisoner, and helps him with<br />\nbasic necessities such as housing<br />\nand employment. The volunteer<br />\nappears in court at the trial and<br />\ninforms the judge of the prisoner's progress and activities.<br />\nCortez Reiney, in-jail specialist<br />\nwith Offender Aid and Restoration, spoke about the direct<br />\nimpact of the program. \"If the<br />\nprisoner can show that over 2 or<br />\n3 months he has taken initiative<br />\nto become involved in some<br />\nproductive activity such as going<br />\nto school or finding employment, this can be a deciding<br />\nfactor in the Judge's decision<br />\nconcerning the prisoner's return<br />\nto society.\"<br /><br />\nResponse<br /><br />\n\"What an act!... and he gets to do it twice a night.\"<br /><br />\nFor the real beer lover.<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nby the favorable responses of<br />\nthose freshmen interviewed)and<br />\nthe obstacles with which the<br />\nCommittee had to contend.

The quotes used<br />\nexpressed the general attitude<br />\nshe conveyed to me in our<br />\ninterview.<br />\n-E.P.<br /><br />\nphotos by Di-Gel Newman<br /><br />\nIt is often pointed out that Hopkins<br />\nstudents can, if they so desire, live at arms<br />\nlength from the real world with little or no<br />\neffert. The University, like some grand incubator for post-adolescents, is fully capable of<br />\nwrapping its protective tentacles around an<br />\nundergraduate until he altogether ceases to<br />\ninteract with the frightening world beyond big,<br />\nbad Charles Street. Not all of us fall into such a<br />\nsterile trap, of course, but the vast majority of<br />\nfolks out there think we do, which invariably<br />\nleads to some problems. Who among us has not<br />\nbeen accosted at one time or another by a<br />\nbellicose cabbie, brawny construction worker, or<br />\nother blue-collar miscontent, who, upon spying<br />\nthe Hopkins crest on our sweat-free shirt,<br />\nproceeds to chew .us out for \"not knowing<br />\na goddamn thing about what it means to work<br />\nfor a living\" and having our heads stuffed full<br />\nof \"candyass intellectual bullshit.\" The most<br />\nvexing thing about such heated verbal ambushes<br />\nis that they contain considerably more than a<br />\ngrain of truth.<br />\nThis past summer I decided to silence these<br />\ncritics and test my mettel at the same time by<br />\nplunging headlong into the job market. No more<br />\n\"ranch maintenance\" for Uncle George in the<br />\nhigh Sierras, no Ian, \"joke n' toke\" work-study<br />\njobs in the MSE stacks-- just me, a ball point<br />\npen, and the want ads.<br />\nI really wondered what was going to<br />\nhappen to my ideology. Can someone who's<br />\nread all of Ayn Rand's novels and watched<br />\nFiring Line religiously since high school go to<br />\nwork in the real marketplace for real bosses and<br />\ncome out anywhere this side of Colonel Khaddafi? The only thing I was sure of was that<br />\nno set of beliefs was worth a damn if they<br />\ncouldn't be put to a test now and again. It had<br />\nto be a difficult test, too... if working for<br />\ncapitalism really was hell, I was determined to<br />\nfind the Seventh Circle.<br />\nI found it alright-- in that distinctively<br />\nAmerican version of the Inferno-- Fast Food.<br />\nIt is no idle metaphor I've been using, for<br />\nwhen this reporter arrived for work on the first<br />\nafternoon, the kitchen was a plutonic hundred<br />\nand ten degrees. It was explained to me by one<br />\nprofusely perspiring veteran that this particular<br />\nstore had dropped below its monthly sales quota<br />\nand was therefore being \"punished\" by being<br />\nplaced at the end of the district's lengthy<br />\nmaintenance list.<br />\nIn the weeks that followed, while the Dog<br />\nDays of summer dragged their tails along the<br />\nburning concrete parking lot outside, the heat<br />\nwithin climbed to truly unbearable heights. By<br />\nthe fourth of July it was almost redundant to<br />\nturn on the stoves, as most of the cuisine would<br />\nbegin cooking the instant it was removed from<br />\nthe cooler. The managers and assistant managers, too cowed to protest to their superiors,<br />\nattempted instead to project an air of cool<br />\nunconcern to the muttering troops. Their guise<br />\nof bravado faltered, however, when one of the<br />\nmore obese capitans suddenly cried out \"Mom-<br /><br />\nWorking Forl:api<br />\nby Cates<br />\nmy! Help!\" in a weak voice and slumped over<br />\ninto a pot of refried beans, his dangling company tie catching fire on the gas jet.<br />\nI finally decided to put a stop to this<br />\nnonsense and called OSHA, only to be told that<br />\ndue to \"the President's deep concern over saving<br />\nenergy,\" that they were not investigating any<br />\nexcessive heat violations that summer. Like Bill<br />\nBuckley says, where is government over-regulation when you need it?<br />\nThe next step was obvious. If we couldn't<br />\nget our unseen tormentors slapped with a heavy<br />\nfine, at least we could get some breathable air<br />\nwith a little sleight of hand. All it took was a call<br />\nfrom one of the huskier-voiced employees<br />\nclaiming to be an irate customer whose darling<br />\ndaughter had fainted dead away while waiting<br />\nfor a taco in the dining area. For good measure,<br />\nhe also claimed that he was considering writing a<br />\nletter to the papers about it. Wellsir, quicker<br />\nthan you could list all the nutrients in a burrito,<br />\nwe had traded the burning Sudan for the bracing<br />\nair of Switzerland.<br />\nThus was I enlightened as to the first rule<br />\nof Fast Food: threats work better than rational<br />\ndiscussion. Managers use threats, therefore they<br />\nunderstand them. Managers don't think, therefore thinking is wasted on them.<br />\nA word or two needs to be said about how<br />\nthe Great Chain of Beans was organized in<br />\nEnchilada Land. At the bottom of the chili vat<br />\nwere the great mass of employees-- the drones as<br />\nwe called ourselves. My fellow workers were far<br />\nfrom being lumpen prolitariat-- for the most part<br />\nthey consisted of housewives, military personnel<br />\ntaking second jobs, teenagers and other people<br />\nwell toward the middle of any bell-curve you'd<br />\ncare to construct. In short, they were people<br />\nheavily in debt who lacked either the training or<br />\nrescouces or the time to seek more rewarding<br />\nwork. They were, for the most part, only<br />\nsemi-educated, but definitely not stupid. They<br />\nwere not particularly docile, either, but they<br />\nneeded money badly enough to put up with a<br />\ngreat deal of humiliation for the sake of $3.00<br />\nan hour. In one way or another, they all seemed<br />\ntrapped there ... some only temporarily, others<br />\nfor the rest of their lives.<br />\nDirectly above us were those most despised<br />\nof creatures, (and rightly so), the assistant<br />\nmanagers. Picked out from the mass of undermensch specifically for their pettyness and<br />\nass-smouching ability, the A.M.'s were given all<br />\nthe dirty and unpleasant jobs by the managers,<br />\nwhich they then performed with a sneering<br />\nrelish and .-,eemingly innate ability. The A.M.'s<br />\nwere cr;atures of rules-- beings who would have<br />\nbeen utter.y lost had they had no one to constantly t Ai them what to do, how to do it, and<br />\nwhat would happen to them if they didn't. They<br />\nloved the company with all their heart (what<br />\nthere was of it) because the company had a rule<br />\nfor literaly everything-- from stuffing enchiladas<br />\nto breaking wind. The company excused them<br />\nfrom thinking, excused them from feeling.., and<br />\nthey were eternally grateful.<br />\nAll these many rules were put down for the<br />\nenlightenment of the Chosen in two, thick<br />\nvolumes which rested on a shelf high above the<br />\nmanagers desk, safe from the prying of vulgar<br />\neyes. Many a night I would see an A.M. bent<br />\nover his beloved rule book, beady eyes intent on<br />\nthe holy scripture, burning with the feverish fire<br />\nof a zealot.<br />\nDirectly over the slime beetles described<br /><br />\nabove were the store managers, for all intents<br />\nand purposes gentlemen of leisure. The work<br />\nthese people did was all cerebral, if I may stretch<br />\nthat term to the breaking point. The typical<br />\nstore manager's day consisted of eight hours of<br />\nanimated criticism of employees or discussions<br />\nof weighty taco politics with other bigwigs,<br />\ninterrupted by frequent meal and coffee breaks.<br />\nI only saw our store manager once-- on the day I<br />\nwas hired-- but I heard about her every day<br />\nwithout fail from then on. Each evening we<br />\nwould get a searing report on her opinion of our<br />\nwork the previous night. Invariably we were<br />\ninformed that she was one of the following:<br />\npissed off, teed off, really steamed, really boiled,<br />\nfed up, fit to be tied, on the warpath, on the rag,<br />\non the ragged edge, ready to scream, ready to<br />\nblow, madder than hell, madder than all hell,<br />\nor completely out of patience with our shoddy<br />\nperformance. She must have been great fun at<br />\nparties.<br />\nThe truth was that managers were not<br />\nencouraged to praise employees for anything at<br />\nanytime or to help them when the going got;<br />\nrough, because:\"such activities tend to blur the<br />\ndistinction between manager and employee and<br />\ncompromise the superior presence essential to all<br />\nmanagerial personnel.\" That's a direct quote<br />\nfrom the Big Book, son, and of such stuff was<br />\nthe day to day environment of good people<br />\nfashioned. Never a \"thank you\", never a \"job<br />\nwell done.\" Nothing to make the drone feel like<br />\nhe was part of a team, or laboring toward a<br />\ncommon goal. Of course there were some rare<br />\nmanagers who refused to toe that noxious line,<br />\nand actually acted like decent human beings.<br />\nThese were the people who got twice the work<br />\nout of their crews with half the problems, much<br />\nto the amazement and annoyance of the party<br />\nliners.<br />\nThe etherial realms above store manager<br />\nwere populated, for the most part, by mythical<br />\nbeings known only to the drones by their<br />\ncryptic monikers: \"Craig,\" \"Mr. Burns,\" and the<br />\napparently omnipotent \"Man From California.\"<br />\nThey sat, so we were told, in their palacial<br />\noffices on Olympus, playing medicine-ball with<br />\nthe planets and toppling governments with just a<br />\nscratch of their crotches. One of these Titans did<br />\ndescend into our midst for a while, though,<br />\nfurnishing an interesting comment on the<br />\nPaths to Taco Glory.<br />\nRick was the training manager for our area<br />\nwhich meant he spent a good portion of cad<br />\nday dealing with assistant managers-- which it<br />\nturn meant that he was bound to have a jaundi<br /><br />\npitali\u00f1iBotuIisrn<br />\nBaldridge<br />\nsize of the potential labor pool for that sort of<br />\nunskilled work guarantees that no effective<br />\norganization of Fast Food peons will ever come<br />\nabout in the near future. The lack of such<br />\n\"constraints upon the market,\" far from producing the harmonious realtions between worker<br />\nand management which some of my libertarian<br />\npundits predicted, instead seemed to produce a<br />\nrampant pettiness and an attitiude of unconcern<br />\namong the managers, the like of which I had<br />\nnever imagined.<br />\nSome examples: In an attempt at cosmetic<br />\nsurgery, every franchise had a secret ceiling on<br /><br />\nced-eye view of life. He was a top shelf rotter all<br />\nright-- one of the worst. The man seemed to<br />\nexude malevolence whenever he stalked into<br />\nour store, eyes darting back and forth in a<br />\ntireless search for every slip-up those frightened<br />\nyoungsters were capable of making. He enjoyed<br />\nchewing people out-- the more minor the offense, the better. No matter how well a certain<br />\ntask was performed, he always managed to pull<br />\nsome niggling fault out of his black hat. He<br />\nmade no attempt to be likeable, and ruled by<br />\nfear alone.<br />\nIt happened that one night Rick had to<br />\ndrive me home, and when he found out that I<br />\nwas a college student, he suddenly felt obligated<br />\nto tell me his philosophy concerning the better<br />\nrunning of fast food establishments. \"I know<br />\nJerry's a nice guy,\" he said, \"but he just doesn't<br />\nhave the right attitude. And I know you think<br />\nJulie's a real nice lady, but she's just too slow<br />\nand I wish she wasn't working for me. Now I<br />\nknow you guys think Suzie's a real bitch, and I<br />\nguess she is, but she's a great little worker all the<br />\nsame.\"<br />\nDear God! I wanted to grab him around his<br />\nhamboned neck and shout: \"Don't you see a<br />\npattern there, chum? Don't you see that you've<br />\nset up a place in which nice people have no place<br />\nand only bastards can make the grade?\"<br />\nBut Rick went rattling on. He was a chicano, and he told me about how he had been<br />\nborn to an unwed mother in the barrio; how he<br />\nhad had to fight his way out of poverty; and<br />\nhow he had grabbed every opportunity that<br />\ncame his direction, no matter what it was. He<br />\ntold me about his upcoming promotion and how<br />\nhe felt that he had \"made it.\" Just before I got<br />\nout of the car, he mentioned something about<br />\ntrying to help his people back in the barrios, and<br />\nhow, for some strange reason he didn't understand, it was so hard to communicate with them<br />\nnow. Bad as he was, I actually felt sorry for the<br />\nheel at that moment. The poor guy didn't see<br />\nhow far down the road he'd strayed; how much<br />\nhe had come to put money ahead of people;<br />\nrules ahead of feelings; and expediency ahead<br />\nof caring. In short, Rick didn't realize just how<br />\nwhite he'd become.<br />\nThe impossibility of any kind of employee<br />\naction for the alleviation of grievances is an<br />\nobvious fact about Fast Food. Every drone in<br />\nthe country could get his pink slip tomorrow<br />\nand within a week the company could be back<br />\nto full strength, stuffing a hungry nation with<br />\nenchiladas once again. The youth and the<br />\nturnover rate of the employees, as well as the<br /><br />\nthe number of people who were supposed to be<br />\nfired each year. For this reason, drones unpopular with the managers had their hours cut and<br />\nwere then repeatedly harrassed in the hope<br />\nthat they- would quit \"voluntarily.\" One exceptionally nice fellow found his work-week reduced to a ludicrous five hours, and his religion<br />\nruthlessly mocked by whatever manager happened to be on duty during that miniscule shift.<br />\nWhen a timecard was submitted with any<br />\novertime on it, the paycheck was routinely<br />\nheld up by what was termed \"paperwork problems in California.\" When it finally arrived,<br />\ntwo to three weeks late, it was invariably made<br />\nout for only a regular forty hour week. Of<br />\ncourse by this time the drone involved was<br />\nusually so glad to finally get some amount of<br />\ngrocery money that seldom was a further protest<br />\nheard.<br />\nOne day during July I accidentally discovered a way of doing one of the many tasks<br />\nin a faster and more efficient way than that laid<br />\ndown in the mighty Book of Rules. One of<br />\nthe assistant managers spotted me and gave me a<br />\ndressing-down on the spot, which was a common<br />\nenough experience. The next day, however, I<br />\ncaught him doing it my way, and by weeks end<br />\nhe was chastizing other drones for not doing it<br />\nin the new manner. It wasn't long before the<br />\nmanagers were swearing up and down that the<br />\nnew way was the way it had always been done,<br />\never since the first primitive burrito crawled out<br />\nof the primevil sea to spawn upon the land.<br />\nThe best piece of textbook exploitation,<br />\nhowever, concerned cash register over-rings:<br />\nthose inevitable mistakes which occur when<br />\ndrunken customers change their order after<br />\nyou've already rung it up. According to the<br />\nBook of Rules, the amount of money in the cash<br />\nregister had to agree exactly with the amount<br />\nshown on the receipt tape at the end of the day.<br />\nAt first the managers were content with verbal<br />\nchastizements directed at those whose registers<br />\ncame up \"short,\" but such permissive behaviour<br />\nwas not destined to last. California was displeased--we had come up short too many times.<br />\nOne day in August it was announced that<br />\neveryone who wound up short would have to<br />\npay the difference out of their own pocket.<br />\nFor people who brought home less than S18.00<br />\na day after taxes, it was nothing short of robbery. This was the pinto bean that ripped the<br />\ntortilla's back. I told them I had no intention of<br />\npaying their punitive fine and if they didn't like<br />\nit they could get another taco stuffer and<br />\nstuff their tacos. The kingpins fussed and fumed<br />\nabout insubordination, but I just didn't care<br />\nanymore. Not a penny would they take from<br />\nmy already unimpressive paycheck. As I remember, I got drunk that night and saw the<br />\nghost of Sir Thomas More. (Luckilly, one of the<br />\ndrones possessing a more practical nature called<br /><br />\nthe D.A's office and got the blatantly illegal<br />\npractice stopped in its tracks.)<br />\nI could go on and on with examples like<br />\nthese, but I'm sure that by now the general<br />\npicture is apparent. Fast Food sucks...and I'm<br />\ntalking about more than just the taste.<br />\nIt is rather ironic that the pot-bellied Elks<br />\nand Kiwanas on America's chambers of commerce always greet a new Fast Food franchise<br />\nwith open arms and open bottles of scotch, for<br />\nthere is surely no institution capable of turning<br />\nteenagers against everything they stand for faster<br />\nthan Fast Food. It produces, for the most part,<br />\npeople whose first work experience has been<br />\nentirely negative; people who have gotten<br />\nnothing for their labor but abuse and a few<br />\nshekels; people whose introduction into American business has left them disenchanted, disheartened, and angry.<br />\nSo much for the proles. The sad thing<br />\nabout the managers was that they were all<br />\nso young. No one in any position of authority<br />\nin the company was over twenty-eight years old,<br />\nincluding the district manager. Yet they manifested attitudes I had come to expect from<br />\npeople much much older than they. Such blind<br />\nobedience to something so shabby at such an<br />\nearly age is doubly sad...and doubly frightening.<br />\nIt just seemed to me that they had all given up<br />\nthe fight much too soon.<br />\nWe do many things almost unconciously,<br />\none of which is to stop in at a Fast Food joint<br />\nfor a burger, a taco, or whatever. It can't even<br />\nbe called a meal, really--just a motorized, mechanized fuel stop on the way to somewhere else.<br />\nMy point is this: that meal which gets placed<br />\nbefore you gets there so easily and so swiftly<br />\nonly because somebody (probably everybody)<br />\nbehind the counter is getting the shaft in a big<br />\nway. There are no hassles to buying fast food<br />\nbecause hassles are the normal results of human<br />\ninteraction, and Fast Food tries to minimize the<br />\nhuman element in every facet of its operation.<br />\nIf the managers had their druthers, most of their<br />\noperation would be mechanized--or at least<br /><br />\n.s<br />\nthe proles' part of. You see, the managers and<br />\nassistant managers just .couldn't be replaced by<br />\ncircuitry, for as of now no one has devised a way<br />\nto make a machine act like an asshole.<br />\nI don't know if I've altered my political<br />\nleanings to any great degree as a result of this<br />\nvery instructive summer, but certain things have<br />\nchanged. I'm more skeptical now of any ideology which claims superiority only by virtue of<br />\nhow good it 'ooks on paper. From now on,<br />\nbefore I take up any banners, I want to see how<br />\nit works in practice on a very small, interpersonal basis: I want to see what it does<br />\nfor-or to-the drones.<br /><br />\n5t<br /><br />\ni _;),Ivc/<br />\n(.1<br />\nPAGE 12/ SEPTEMBER 14, 1979<br /><br />\nN-L<br />\nCLASSIFIEDS<br /><br />\nANIMAL commtess<br /><br />\nme COMM ACT<br /><br />\nTuesday<br />\n8:30<br /><br />\nFri.!Sat.<br /><br />\n$3admission<br /><br />\n$3 admission<br /><br />\nI<br />\nCEJ\u00b0 if 1<br />\nHAIRCUT - SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITION $7.50 for Men, Women, &amp;<br />\nChildren WITH THIS AD.

Monty<br />\nPython? Second City? None of the<br />\nabove? Since the beginning of May,<br />\nBaltimore has been blessed with potentially the finest crew of motley scumbags<br />\nthis side of a John Waters Christmas<br />\nparty, legitimized under the name Animal<br /><br />\nCrackers. Under the direction of Steven<br />\nA. Libowitz, the six-member troupe of<br />\nLinda Rae Favila, John Kassir, Jerry<br />\nMaglio, Marie Marciano, Jeff Marder, and<br />\nLarry Schwartz has had to turn away<br />\nbetween 50 and 200 people at the door<br />\nfrom each of their Friday and Saturday<br />\nmidnight shows in the tiny Bolton Hill<br />\nDinner Theatre.<br />\nLibowitz is astounded by the turnout. \"We had no idea, when we began,<br />\nwhether or not the city would support us.<br />\nOur philosophy was, and is, that the<br />\nBaltimore audience has been subjected to<br />\nyears of New York and California humor,<br />\nbetween television and the movies. Since<br />\ncomedy ultimately deals with the truth,<br />\nand since all of us in Animal Crackers are<br />\nfrom the area, we felt that Baltimoreans<br />\nmight be receptive to us and our jokes<br />\nabout the city.\"<br />\nAnd receptive they were. Tuesday's<br />\nshow, a selection of the \"Best of Animal<br />\nCrackers\" from the past four months,<br />\ndrew uncontrollable laughter from the<br />\naudience. In fact, during the blackout<br /><br />\nfollowing a satirized advertisement for<br />\n\"The Maryland National Sperm Bank,\" in<br />\nwhich John Kassir was making a night<br />\ndeposit into something called \"Harvey<br />\nBallbanger,\" I thought I noticed someone<br />\nrushing off with a bursting bladder to<br />\nrelieve himself.<br />\nAnimal Crackers' members were<br />\nchosen from public auditions held last<br />\nApril. The six chosen turned out to be<br />\nstudents from Towson StateandUniversity<br />\nof Maryland, Baltimore Campus. Libowitz casually contends that his group has<br />\nan advantage over the cast of Saturday<br />\nNight Live, whose players are constantly at each other's throats backstage. The<br />\nBaltimore group shares the best of<br />\nfeelings between its members. There are<br />\nother important differences between the<br />\ntwo: Animal Crackers is under no<br />\nrestriction from the Federal Communications Commission and is therefore free to<br />\nstage a no-holds-barred show, whereas a<br />\nnationally televised program like Saturday Night Live must obviously shy away<br />\nfrom regionalism, where Animal Crackers<br />\nuses regional comedy as its mainstay.<br />\nOverall, the quality of the writing is<br />\nvery good; 90% of the time it is right<br />\non the mark. Only in the longer skits was<br />\nthe humor difficult to sustain. According<br />\nto Libowitz, the cast members do most of<br />\nthe writing, although outside scripts are<br />\nalso accepted. Many of the scripts are<br />\nwritten for certain ensemble members;<br />\nmany are written in the process of<br />\nworking out the idea. Usually the group<br />\nbegins performing a skit three weeks from<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br /><br />\nBreaking Away:<br />\nA Tour de Force<br />\nBY CLIFF HARRIS<br />\nDave Stoller, the bicycle-pedaling<br />\nteen-ager in Breaking Away, seems<br />\nnormal enough on the surface; he's just<br />\nout of high school, without a job or any<br />\nparticular plans for the future, and tends<br />\nto hang out with his three buddies, Mike,<br />\nMoocher, and Cyril at an abandoned<br />\nstone quarry in his town of Bloomington,<br />\nIndiana. But contrary to the soft, lazy<br />\nmood evoked in the film's opening<br />\nsequence, Dave is strongly driven. Obsessed with bicycling, he rides as often as<br />\npossible, pampering his ten-speeder the<br />\nway other boys his age fuss over hot rods.<br />\nBut Dave's obsession doesn't stop there;<br />\nhe is madly infatuated with Italy, the<br />\nhome of the world's top cyclists, and<br />\ndoes everything possible to transform<br />\nhimself into a true Italian, from adopting<br />\nwhat he likes to think is an Italian accent<br />\nto naming his cat Fellini and feeding him<br />\nHe even<br />\nfrom a Cinzano ashtray.<br />\nexperiences Italian romance, falling in<br />\nlove with a dark-haired sorority girl from<br />\nlocal Indiana Unviersity and passing<br />\nhimself off as an Italian exchange student.<br />\nDave's father, played with superb<br />\nbefuddlement and impatience by Paul<br />\nDooley, doesn't exactly approve of his<br />\nson's \"eye-talian\" inclinations. He is a<br />\ntrue-blue middle American, from his<br />\nclip-on tie down to his pot-belly, and is<br />\nsincerely proud of his beginnings as a<br />\nhard-working stonecutter in the local<br />\nlimestone quarries. Much of the film's<br />\nhumor derives from Dooley's confused,<br />\nbrow-knitting reactions to his son's<br />\nItalian opera records, his greeting of<br />\n\"Ciao, Poppa!\" and his ever-thickening<br />\naccent. Mr. Stoller simply can't compre-<br /><br />\nhend why his Son would be interested in<br />\nanything besides french fries, used cars,<br />\nand limestone. However, Dave's mother,<br />\nsensitively protrayed by Barbara Barrie,<br />\nsympathizes with her son's attraction to<br />\nItaly; although she has relatively little to<br />\nsay, the warm, knowing look in her eyes<br />\nsuggests that she realizes, unlike her<br />\nobstinate husband, that their lives could<br />\nuse a dash or two of romance.<br />\nDennis Christopher, as Dave, and<br />\nDennis Quaid, Daniel Stern, and Jackie<br />\nEarl Haley as his friends, all give excellent, convincing performances, while<br />\ncarefully avoiding pretention or showi\u2014<br />\nness. As they are relatively unknown,<br />\nunfamiliar faces, they are well suited to 1,<br />\nSteve Tesich's screenplay, which is a s<br />\nmarvelous example of skillful understatement and restraint.
