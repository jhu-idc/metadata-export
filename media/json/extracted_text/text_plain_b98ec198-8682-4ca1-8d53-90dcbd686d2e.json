In his letter of invitation to President Bush, Muller<br />\nsuggested two dates to give a<br />\nspeech at Hopkins\u2014the June 7<br />\ndate and Commemoration Day on<br />\nFebruary 22, the official end of<br />\nthe centennial year celebration.<br />\nThe President was unable to<br />\nspeak at the inauguration on June<br />\n7, sending Secretary of Health<br />\nand Human Services Louis<br />\nSullivan in his stead.<br />\nBush's decision in late January<br />\nto accept Hopkins' standing invitation to speak on February 22<br />\ncame as a surprise to the Hopkins<br />\nadministration.<br />\nThe University had solicited<br />\nmembers of the faculty and administration to participate in the<br />\nprocessional at the ceremony.<br />\nPrior to the White House announcement, about 500 faculty<br />\nmembers had responded to invitations. In the past, many pro-<br />\n<br />\nMike Blumhardt<br />\n<br />\nPresident Muller regretted that so few students were invited to Commemoration Day ceremonies. President<br />\nBush is the invited speaker for the 100th commemoration of Hopkins Medicine.<br />\n<br />\nfessors who returned confirmations nevertheless did not appeared at the Commemoration<br />\nceremony.<br />\n\"We expect very few no-shows<br />\nnow because Bush is speaking,\"<br />\nsaid Muller.<br />\nGeorge Bush will bring along<br />\nan extensive entourage of security<br />\npersonnel and media to the<br />\nHopkins campus, adding to the<br />\nlarge number already expected to<br />\nbe present at the speech.<br />\n<br />\nThe White House announcement in late January prompted<br />\nHopkins to move the Commemoration Day ceremonies<br />\nfrom the 700-seat Turner<br />\nauditorium at the medical institutions to the 1150-seat Shriver Hall<br />\non the Homewood campus.<br />\nAs with any appearance by the<br />\nPresident, special requirements<br />\nmust be met for the media.<br />\nSeating the White House press<br />\ncorps alone demands at least 100<br />\n<br />\nSee BUSH, 2<br />\n<br />\nin Henry's edition, \"write-ins\"<br />\nmust register with the Elections<br />\nCommittee \"at least 36 hours<br />\nbefore the opening of the polls.\"<br />\nIn response to sharp criticism<br />\nconcerning this restrictive clause,<br />\nHenry voiced the committee's<br />\nopinion that, under the current<br />\nsystem, the \"write-in\" process is<br />\ntoo easy to abuse. The committee felt that one should have to<br />\n\"make an effort\" to get elected.<br />\nCouncil Vice-President Petrina<br />\nHsi argued that in order to win<br />\nas a \"write-in\" significant effort<br />\nis involved, including getting in<br />\ntouch with enough voters, making sure they actually write down<br />\nthe name, and making sure they<br />\nhave spelled it correctly. Other<br />\nproblems cited by representatives<br />\nwere the possible abuse of the advanced standing to change the<br />\nclass in which one is elected, the<br />\ncut in signatures to only five per-<br />\n<br />\ncent of the total number in the<br />\nclass, and the inclusion of at least<br />\ntwo candidates' forums.<br />\nHenry agreed to address all of<br />\nthese concerns in the revised edition of the Constitution that he<br />\nwill present to Council next<br />\nweek. In closing, he added that<br />\nthe changes were intended to<br />\n\"make the elections process more<br />\nreal,\" hoping that if \"the candidates take the process more<br />\nseriously, the student body will<br />\ntake the process more seriously.\"<br />\nDiscussion turned to Commemoration Day ceremonies and<br />\nthe prospect of student attendance.

Our<br />\nmain goal is bringing the offensive behavior to an end,\" said<br />\nAndrea Perry, director of<br />\nResidential Life and a member of<br />\nthe Network.<br />\nThe network uses an informal<br />\nresolution process,as its primary<br />\nrole is as a support for the victim. According to Perry, \"The<br />\nadvisors are able to put victims<br />\nin touch with legal avenues and<br />\nmake a referral to the appropriate<br />\nadministrative office on campus<br />\nso that a formal complaint is<br />\nrecorded.\"<br />\n\"All the members of the Network have received some<br />\ntraining in the counseling of victims of harassment,\" according<br />\nto Perry. The main purpose of the<br />\nnetwork \"is to assist all members<br />\nof the [University] community<br />\nthat feel that they have been sexually harassed or are uncertain<br />\nabout whether they have been.\"<br />\n\"The Network is very anxious<br />\nto publicize its existence and encourages members of the community who are confronting an<br />\n<br />\nissue to take advantage of the support network,\" said Perry. She<br />\nwent on to add, \"Often times we<br />\nassist in figuring out whether or<br />\nnot they have been harassed. In<br />\nmany incidences, people are unsure if what has occurred is<br />\nharassment.\"<br />\nSexual harassment is not<br />\nalways as obvious as one would<br />\nbelieve. Harassment in the<br />\nuniversity environment encompasses more than just requiring<br />\nsexual favors as a prerequisite for<br />\nacademic success. It also comes<br />\nin many less blatant forms, including sexual teasing or jokes,<br />\neven slight physical contact.<br />\nBecause sexual harassment does<br />\ncome in many forms and varying<br />\ndegrees, many people choose to<br />\nignore it, fearing they may be<br />\nwrong; others are sure, but are<br />\ntoo embarrassed to talk with<br />\nanyone about it. According to<br />\nPerry, there is nothing to fear or<br />\nbe embarrassed over; everyone<br />\nhas the right to pursue their<br />\neducation in a conducive atmosphere. In reporting sexual<br />\nharassment one is merely asserting the rights one has under<br />\nUniversity policy as well as state<br />\nlaw.<br />\nThe University has a strict<br />\npolicy on sexual harassment: any<br />\nconduct \"which creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive<br />\nlearning or working environment<br />\n<br />\nis prohibited. The University will<br />\npromptly investigate complaints<br />\nof sexual harassment and . . . will<br />\ninstitute disciplinary proceedings<br />\nagainst the offending individual.\"<br />\nAlso, according to Perry,\"The<br />\nAdvisors Network is not primarily designed to help victims of<br />\nassault or rape.\" It is suggested<br />\nthat if one is assaulted that one<br />\ncontact either campus security or<br />\nthe police immediately and seek<br />\nmedical attention.

Additionally,\". . . in all<br />\nof the battles he was victorious.\"<br />\nJones interpreted the 960 figure<br />\nas poetic, not truth. Given that the<br />\nWelsh phrase describing this<br />\nnumber exhibits alliteration (a<br />\npoetic device where the initial<br />\nletter of several words in succession sounds or is the same), Jones<br />\nsaid, \"I'm convinced that we are<br />\ndealing with a poem.\"<br />\nHe added, \"Poets judge valor.<br />\nThey determine bravery.\"<br />\nTherefore, Jones continued to<br />\npresent examples of how poets<br />\n<br />\nduring this time transformed King<br />\nArthur into a hero of fantastic<br />\nproportions. \"Arthur became a<br />\nmagnet toward whom all sorts of<br />\ndrifting tales attached,\" said<br />\nJones. In his opinion, \"Arthur retains the human dimension. He is<br />\nSuperman but not supernatural.\"<br />\nJones covered many different<br />\npossibilities in his lecture surrounding the existence of King<br />\nArthur. He said there were those<br />\npoets who were unsure of Arthur's existence and therefore<br />\nchose not to mention him in their<br />\nworks.<br />\n\"Who is Arthur?\" Jones questioned. \"We do not know. What<br />\nwe do know is that there were<br />\nmany [different Arthurs].\" He<br />\nalso said, \"One can claim that<br />\nWales is the cradle of early Arthurian literature.\"<br />\n\"I happen to believe that a man<br />\ncalled Arthur lived,\" said Jones.<br />\n\"I believe he lived around 500<br />\n[A.D.].

Recently, this prevailing<br />\nattitude has been made evident by<br />\nthe minimal involvement of<br />\nUniversity-owned apartment<br />\nresidents in the decision making<br />\nprocess regarding University<br />\napartment renovations. The committees set up to discuss these<br />\nrenovations included administrators from the Offices of<br />\nResidential Life, Auxiliary Enterprises, Housing, Facilities<br />\nManagement, and the Dean of<br />\nStudents. Initially, when this<br />\ncomprehensive committee met,<br />\nresident input was not effectively utilized. As far as can be<br />\ndiscerned, no appropriate resident<br />\nrepresentatives were included in<br />\nthe planning process. In fact, the<br />\nstudents on the original committee were chosen specifically<br />\nbecause they lived in off-campus<br />\nhousing and were hand-picked by<br />\nthe administration. As a result,<br />\nthese students considered only the<br />\ndisadvantages of living in University housing. In making changes<br />\nthat affect resident life, those<br />\nstudents most directly affected<br />\nshould have been consulted on a<br />\nmuch larger scale. Specifically,<br />\nstudents living in Universityowned apartments would have<br />\nbeen an ideal choice for additional student representation for<br />\nthis comprehensive committee.<br />\nCommunity Assistants, working for the Housing Office and<br />\nthe Office of Residential Life,<br />\nhave as one of their major responsibilities the role of liason between the University-owned apartment residents and the administrators of the Homewood<br />\ncampus for housing-related concerns. In light of this responssibility, it would have been appropriate to include Community<br />\nAssistants on the committee for<br />\nUniversity apartment renovations. Because of this omission,<br />\nideas form residents were not<br />\nconsidered. The following are<br />\nconcerns relayed to Community<br />\n<br />\nAssistants by current University<br />\napartment residents with regards<br />\nto the soon-to-be-available Bradford Apartments.<br />\n(1) Students will be held<br />\nresponsible for the entire apartment lease, paying per unit instead of the current method of<br />\npaying per bed.<br />\n(2) Eventual plans include forcing the tenant to commit to a<br />\n12-month lease instead of the current 9-month lease option.<br />\n(3) Students will be responsible for arranging their own<br />\nutilities. This will be an additional expense not accounted for<br />\nin the rent.<br />\n(4) Rental price estimates have<br />\nyet to be released for students and<br />\ntheir parents.<br />\nSome other concerns, in<br />\ngeneral, about the proposed<br />\nUniversity apartment renovations<br />\nare as follows:<br />\n(1) More apartment units<br />\nshould have been designated as<br />\nsingle-occupancy dwellings.<br />\n(2) Attention should have been<br />\npaid more to the overall quality<br />\nof student life than to the maximum number of students housed together.<br />\n(3) The current question over<br />\nmandated versus guaranteed<br />\nsophomore housing in the<br />\nrenovated Wolman and McCoy<br />\nApartments should be answered<br />\nonly after consulting students<br />\nmost affected by the plans.<br />\nThese are just a few of the ideas<br />\nthat have yet to be addresses<br />\nsatisfactorily. Future renovation<br />\nplans must resolve these issues.<br />\nClearly student involvement at all<br />\nlevels is crucial in planning for<br />\nresident life. It is not sufficient for<br />\nonly students outside of University housing to participate in the<br />\ndecision making process.<br />\nResidents, instead, should be actively involved from the beginning. While it is understandable<br />\nSee HOUSING, 6<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn response to the article written by Rebecca Garron which appeared in the last issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter: Ms. Garron states<br />\nthat the intention of her discourse<br />\nis to defend the 2x +1 cartoon<br />\nfrom \"misdirected, impassioned<br />\ncriticism.\" She begins her<br />\ndefense by questioning whether<br />\nor not the cartoon, a cartoon<br />\nwhich seeks to define a woman's<br />\nmerit solely on the basis of her<br />\nsexual attractiveness, is sexist.<br />\nThe call for \"all hate mail\"<br />\nscrawled beneath the cartoon<br />\nunderscores the fact that the<br />\nauthor's primary intention was to<br />\noffend. Mr. Podurgiel requested<br />\na response; I think he is getting<br />\nthat for which he asked.<br />\nMs. Garron goes on to<br />\nenumerate the responsibilities of<br />\nthe Hopkins community. She<br />\nstates that censorship in not the<br />\nanswer. She is completely correct. To address the issue at hand.<br />\nwhen we, not the Women's<br />\nGroup but for Hopkins students,<br />\nspoke to Dean Boswell, our intentions were as follows. We<br />\nwanted a letter to be distributed<br />\nto all students by Homewood<br />\nDeans stating that sexism should<br />\nnot be tolerated on the campus.<br />\nSecondly, we wanted a meeting<br />\narranged between the Spectator,<br />\nthe GRO, and the concerned<br />\nstudents so that we could determine the positions of all involved, why the GRO allocated<br />\nUniversity funds to support this<br />\nissue of the Spectator, and<br />\nwhether the GRO was aware of<br />\nthe cartoon in question.<br />\nIt was not these four students<br />\nbut Ms. Garron herself who calls<br />\nfor the SAC to \"pull its funding<br />\nfrom the Spectator.\" It seems that<br />\nMs. Garron did not bother to<br />\ngather the correct information<br />\nbefore she began her tirade. Firstly, it was not a \"special-interest<br />\ngroup\" which filed the complaint<br />\nagainst the Spectator but four<br />\nstudents, two of whom were<br />\nunaffiliated. Secondly, the goal of<br />\nthese students was not to stifle but<br />\nto draw out the issue of sexism.<br />\nThirdly, the Spectator is not funded by the SAC but an outside<br />\norganization. It was granted funds<br />\nfor only this issue by the GRO,<br />\nthus her call for SAC funding to<br />\nbe denied, besides suggesting<br />\ncensorship, is useless.<br />\nTo continue with Ms. Garron's<br />\nlist of reponsibilities: under item<br />\nnumber two, she attempts to shift<br />\nthe \"blame\" for this cartoon<br />\nfrom the cartoonist to the Spectator. My questions to Rebecca<br />\nGarron: Is the Spectator some<br />\namorphous mass? Is it not made<br />\nup of its contributors? Do they<br />\nhave no responsibility for their<br />\nsubmissions?<br />\nThe list is concluded with item<br />\n<br />\nnumber three, in which Ms. Garron attempts to redefine the<br />\ndefinition of special interest<br />\ngroups, claiming that all groups<br />\nshould be dedicated to combatting<br />\n\"all issues which divide the community.\" Perhaps Ms. Garron is<br />\nthe only student who has the time<br />\nand energy to devote to every<br />\nissue on campus; the fact that<br />\nmost students are busy with<br />\nclasses, etc. is the reason why<br />\nresponsibilities are divided.<br />\nMs. Garron does make one<br />\nuseful comment: \"if we can't<br />\neradicate prejudice in the containment of academia, we will be<br />\nunable to hinder its reproduction<br />\nin society at large.\" This is our<br />\noverall goal, not censorship, but<br />\nincreased awareness and eventual<br />\ndefeat of the prejudices that are<br />\nprevalent on the campus and in<br />\nsociety. Perhaps Ms. Garron and<br />\nothers like her should stop to<br />\nassess the correct information<br />\nfrom \"misdirected, impassioned<br />\ncriticism.\"<br />\nKelly King<br />\n<br />\nDear James<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAt the risk of joining what I<br />\nthink is a senseless enterprise, I<br />\nhave a few things I'd like to bring<br />\nup.<br />\nLook, James, you're a funny<br />\nguy and a talented artist, and your<br />\nwork in the past has been impressive. However, don't kid<br />\nyourself into thinking that you're<br />\nthe end-all and be-all of political<br />\ncommentary on this campus.<br />\nYour apology to your reading<br />\npublic in your first letter was<br />\nridiculous. Do you really believe<br />\nthat anyone at Hopkins relied on<br />\nyour cartoon every week? Don't<br />\nbe silly. If it was there, they read<br />\nit. If it was funny, they laughed.<br />\nOtherwise, you went largely unnoticed. It's been tested, James\u2014<br />\nvery few people can remember on<br />\nMonday what your cartoon on<br />\nFriday was about without prompting. Besides which, if you<br />\nreally wanted to provide for your<br />\nreading public after you left the<br />\nNews-Letter, you could have<br />\ntaken the Hopkins Spectator way<br />\nout, and postered campus, now<br />\ncouldn't you?<br />\nAs far as the censorship issue<br />\ngoes, you weren't censored, you<br />\nwere edited. I didn't see the cartoon, and quite frankly, I don't<br />\ncare to see it. The fact of the matter is that you have been on staff<br />\nat the News-Letter for four years<br />\nnow, and if you have any problem with the judgement of your<br />\neditors, you should have brought<br />\nit up before they were picked last<br />\nyear. Obviously, the number of<br />\npeople that feel as you do are in<br />\nthe minority there, otherwise,<br />\nBrown and Engler would not be<br />\nwhere they are now. And if the<br />\nLax player cartoon you published the week before all this started<br />\n<br />\nwas any indication, they probably<br />\ndidn't edit you because of the<br />\nsubject material, they probably<br />\nedited you because you weren't<br />\nfunny.<br />\nThis is not a dig, this is not an<br />\ninsult, it's just a point. All the<br />\ncomments made by the Lax coach<br />\nin the cartoon were hackneyed<br />\nstereotypical ideas that I have<br />\nheard since I got here, and the<br />\ndrawing was redundant. I did not<br />\nfear for the social harmony of the<br />\ncampus, I was not brought to<br />\nsome as-yet-unequalled ire, I just<br />\ndidn't laugh. It wasn't funny,<br />\nJames.<br />\nYou could argue, I suppose,<br />\nthat you weren't trying to be funny, that you were making a social<br />\ncommentary, a la Garry Trudeau<br />\n(parallel to be noted by the style<br />\nof the drawing). Well, Garry<br />\nTrudeau manages to be funny<br />\nwhen he makes his social commentary, and I have never known<br />\nGarry Trudeau to draw real people in his cartoon for the sole purpose of lambasting them, as you<br />\nhave done in the past (George<br />\nLerner, Andrea Perry, Steven<br />\nMuller, etc.). If this still does not<br />\nconvince you, James, show the<br />\ncartoon to Mr. Trudeau when he<br />\narrives in May and see what he<br />\nthinks.<br />\nBut I digress. James, every<br />\nweek, I turn in about 50-60 pages<br />\nof text, and I get edited down to<br />\nabout three. I'm hurt, I feel<br />\ncheated, but I turn in a new column the next week. Brown and<br />\nEngler leave in what they think<br />\nwill still be amusing, and<br />\nsometimes they're wrong. And,<br />\nif they decided to cut me<br />\naltogether one week, they would<br />\ndo it. Such is life.<br />\nBut then, no doubt you think<br />\nmy column is useless fluff. And<br />\nyou're right. I choose not to make<br />\nthe sweeping and important<br />\nstatements that you do. I would<br />\nimagine the whole approach to<br />\nyour cartoon is different. Certainly you would not allow them to<br />\nhack one of your panels every<br />\nweek. This is a given. Also, I<br />\nunderstand that each week,<br />\nBrown and Engler waited for you<br />\nto turn in your \"cartoon.\"<br />\nSingular. That is, if they didn't<br />\ngo with what you gave them, they<br />\nwent with nothing. This was not<br />\ntheir doing, it was yours. You<br />\nmight have given them an alternative, as the other writers at the<br />\nNews-Letter do. But you don't.<br />\nYou made editing, their job,<br />\nimpossible.<br />\nJames, why should you be the<br />\nonly writer at the News-Letter not<br />\nsubject to editing? The editors of<br />\nthe News-Letter are faced with the<br />\ntask of presenting an acceptable<br />\nNews-Letter to a politically<br />\nvolatile campus. With your last<br />\ncartoon, you presented them with<br />\na no-win situation. Either the<br />\npresumed racial subject matter<br />\nwould become the controversy,<br />\n<br />\nor you would. Very clever on<br />\nyour part, James, but it makes me<br />\nwonder whether you're reacting<br />\nthis way because you truly feel<br />\nwronged or because you're upset<br />\nabout being taken out of the<br />\nspotlight.<br />\nBy the way, was that your<br />\nValentine to the News-Letter in<br />\nlast week's issue?<br />\nChristopher T. McColl<br />\n<br />\nFree Speech<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n<br />\nAs a relative newcomer to The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, I<br />\nthought I might add perspective<br />\non the controversies over \"free<br />\nspeech versus an offensive<br />\nmessage\" debate. Before arriving at Hopkins in September, I<br />\nspent four years at Stanford<br />\nUniversity, where a serious<br />\ndebate concerning the same subject divided the campus along<br />\nsimilar lines. The main controversy was over whether the<br />\nUniversity should allow students<br />\nwith extremely offensive,<br />\negregiously inappropriate opinions to proclaim their cretinous<br />\nstupidity in posters in university<br />\ndormitories. One specific case involved Ujaama, the Black theme<br />\nhouse, which found a defaced<br />\nposter of Beethoven (who it is<br />\nbelieved was partially Black) with<br />\na racist epithet scrawled across<br />\nthe front. Various campus<br />\ngroups, most notably the<br />\nresidents of the house, were appalled; \"Clearly we do not have<br />\nto tolerate that sort of belittling,<br />\ndefaming, racist-motivated, irrational attack on the grounds of<br />\nfreedom of speech, do we?\" they<br />\nasked in outrage.<br />\nWell, as a member of a leftwing coalition most likely to<br />\nagree with this point of view,<br />\nnonethless I personally must<br />\ndisagree; we do have to tolerate<br />\nthat sort of thing. The forum of<br />\nideas that the various media provide us with should not be<br />\nregulated by the prevailing<br />\nfashion, or we may soon find our<br />\nopinions silenced as well. The<br />\nUnited States has not always been<br />\na land where people could speak<br />\nout against established points of<br />\nview. A congressman from my<br />\nhome state, J.Q. Adams<br />\n(previously U.S. President), was<br />\nrepeatedly refused the right to<br />\nspeak in Congress in the 1830's<br />\nand 40's against slavery. Adams<br />\nwaged an unending, unsuccessful<br />\nbattle against the infamous \"gag<br />\nrule.\" His views were not allowed to be aired, because they offended the sensitivities of the<br />\nSoutherners and their peculiar institution.<br />\nNowadays, it is easy to say that<br />\nall races should be treated equally. To think otherwise is difficult,<br />\nSee LETTERS, 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nLETTERS, from 4<br />\nto express otherwise is to risk<br />\nsocial ostracism, and that's great.<br />\nIt shows how successful those offensive people in the 50's and<br />\n60's were in changing people's<br />\nattitudes. However, when someone wants to cross outside of<br />\nour new version of the politically correct, it is his or her right to<br />\ndo so, and he or she should have<br />\nthe same access to the same<br />\nmedia that we right-thinking folks<br />\ndo. After all, without that, our<br />\nideas would never have become<br />\nwhat right-thinking folks are now<br />\nthinking. Just this week, South<br />\nAfricans received the right to<br />\nprint and say what they think.<br />\nWhite and Blacks were dancing<br />\nin the streets as uncensored<br />\nnewspapers rolled off the presses.<br />\nAnd if someday when the goodguys who are protecting us from<br />\nthe nastiness of offensive cartoons<br />\nwith racist and sexist messages<br />\nhave fallen out of favor, and the<br />\nevil-nasties are back in charge of<br />\ndetermining what the public<br />\nshould or shouldn't read, we, the<br />\nonce-again-offensive, may wish<br />\nwe had not established the precedent of easy censorship of difference of opinion, in the name<br />\nof protecting the offended.<br />\nJohn S. Mill once wrote, in On<br />\nLiberty, \"The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others,<br />\nor wanting in due consideration for<br />\ntheir welfare, without going the<br />\nlength of violating their constituted rights.\" And \"We have<br />\na right, also, in various ways, to<br />\nact upon our unfavourable opinion of anyone, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in<br />\nthe excercise of ours.\" Excercise<br />\nyour individuality. Tell the jerk<br />\nhow much you hate his cartoon.<br />\nDeprive yourself of the publication to show them how mad it<br />\nmade you. Stick out your tongue<br />\nat the next three guys you see.<br />\nPerhaps before the right-thinking<br />\npeople on campus oppress the individuality of the cartoonist in<br />\nquestion by requesting that journals publishing offensive<br />\n<br />\nAll the World's A...<br />\n<br />\nmaterials lose their funding, or<br />\nthe journals themselves selfcensor these opinions by refusing<br />\nto print them, Mill's \u2022 words<br />\nshould be heeded. Maybe not.<br />\nYou have the right to your own<br />\nopinion. Just be careful of what<br />\nyou want, my little children, or<br />\nyou shall surely get it.<br />\nAndy Schwartz<br />\n<br />\nBush 1<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Feb. 22nd, George Bush is<br />\nslated to speak at Hopkins' Commemoration Day exercises, and<br />\nto receive an honorary degree.<br />\nThe irony of this has thus far<br />\ncaused very little controversy on<br />\nthe Homewood Campus, considering that this is an institute of<br />\nhigher learning whose fame has<br />\ncome primarily from advancing<br />\nmedical knowledge and human<br />\nhealth.<br />\nThis man, who in cahoots with<br />\nhis predecessor, has wrought<br />\nhavoc on higher education and<br />\nhealth care in this country, is going to receive the highest accolade that this university has to<br />\noffer. His 1990 budget proposal<br />\nallocated less than 8% for all<br />\nhealth and education programs<br />\ncombined (1.5 billion dollars less<br />\nthan the 1990 budget proposed by<br />\nthe Reagan administration!). In<br />\nspite of all of the events in the<br />\nworld over the past year, his 1991<br />\nbudget proposes increasing the<br />\nmilitary budget again, while funding for higher education loan<br />\nprograms will be cut, again. This<br />\nman's sole public health accomplishment has been to create<br />\npublic hysteria over illegal drug<br />\nconsumption, at a time when illegal drug death rates and addiction rates are at their lowest in 15<br />\nyears. (According to former<br />\nSurgeon General Koop, in 1988<br />\nthere were about 2,000 cocaine<br />\nrelated deaths in the U.S. and<br />\n390,000 deaths from tobacco.) At<br />\nthe same time, the Reagan and<br />\nBush administrations have been<br />\n<br />\nrelentless in their political arm<br />\ntwisting in order to open foreign<br />\nmarkets to tobacco imports (i.e.<br />\nThailand). The domestic health<br />\npolicies of the past decade have<br />\nallowed such places as Italy, East<br />\nGermany, and Hong Kong to surpass the U.S. with regard to infant survival rates.<br />\nHopkins has had a somewhat<br />\nschizophrenic face since it was<br />\nfounded by a liquor-running<br />\nQuaker. Today these faces remain, personified by A.P.L. and<br />\nHopkins' notoriously cutthroat<br />\nfiscal policies(as recently criticized in the Wall Street Journal), and<br />\npersonifying the other face, as the<br />\nhost of the Albert Schweitzer<br />\nAward for Humanitarianism, and<br />\nby the University's fundraising<br />\nefforts for the United Way. It is<br />\nnot difficult to conclude which<br />\nface has invited Mr. Bush.<br />\nLes Roberts<br />\n<br />\nBush H<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nCommemoration Day is a<br />\nspecial occasion for the university. This is a time for all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community to celebrate and share in<br />\nthe great pride of our school's<br />\nfounding. Unfortunately, students<br />\nare not allowed to join in the<br />\ncelebration this year.<br />\nOn February 22, President<br />\nGeorge Bush will be addressing<br />\nan audience devoid of students in<br />\nShriver Hall. Although there<br />\nwere provisions made to allow<br />\nfor one representative from each<br />\nof the divisions of the school (one<br />\nfor the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences and one for the Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering), it is a<br />\ndefinite slight on the student body<br />\nand a statement on how the<br />\nperceives the<br />\nuniversity<br />\nundergraduate community. I<br />\nunderstand that there are trustees,<br />\nadministrators, and faculty who<br />\nshould be present, yet the one student representative allotment is<br />\nfar from appeasing.<br />\nHow does the school perceive<br />\n<br />\nELL., I'M GoING TO GO<br />\n//sire rite we-1W ! tnsr<br />\nA PorTEN<br />\nON IN IC<br />\nEGG!<br />\n<br />\nby Jack Horn<br />\n<br />\ntVicKr, bo ri tr Fonaer<br />\nTo conrcki Our POIt<br />\n!<br />\n!SHARKS<br />\n<br />\nAL.L<br />\n<br />\n'SO<br />\n<br />\n44.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nundergrads?

This<br />\nrelationship, however, has been<br />\nseriously jeopardized. I sincerely hope that the University<br />\nchanges its attitude toward the<br />\nstudents of this school. In the<br />\nfuture, the university should be<br />\nmore conscious of the implications of their decisions and should<br />\ntreat students less as an annoyance to deal with and more as<br />\nan integral part of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nArt Yoon<br />\nPresident, Class of 1991<br />\n<br />\nMuller<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn the midst of all the Commemoration Day- excitement, I<br />\nwould like to express an open invitation to all students to another<br />\nannual event of interest\u2014 President Muller's address to the Student Council on tuition increases<br />\nfor the upcoming year.

To say it's a less difficult book than \"Gravity's Rainbow\" hardly speaks well of its<br />\naccessibility, though that is one<br />\nof its strengths. Set in pre- and<br />\npost-war California with brief<br />\ntrips to Japan and Honolulu, Pynchon's focus has returned home<br />\nto consider the past, present, and<br />\nfuture of America and its confused children. Gone are the interminable ellipses and horrific<br />\ninterludes; they've been replaced by a crackling narrative<br />\nand rapturous illustrations of the<br />\nnorthern California countryside<br />\nthat is the imaginary Vineland<br />\nCounty.

Tender<br />\ntales of the middle-aged working<br />\nclass are few and far between,<br />\nand for good reason: if they're<br />\naccurate, they're completely<br />\nuneventful. Martin Ritt's<br />\n\"Stanley and Iris\" is the latest<br />\ncrack at this difficult nut\u2014and as<br />\nfar as nuts go, it's pretty<br />\nindigestible.<br />\nRobert DeNiro sheds his<br />\npalooka image to play Stanley<br />\nCox, an illiterate cook who eventually loses his job due to his inability to read. Of course, he<br />\nwasn't having any problems at all<br />\nuntil the nosy Iris King (Jane<br />\nFonda) put her two cents in.<br />\nIris is recently widowed, raising her grade-school son (Harley<br />\nCross) and budding daughter<br />\n(Martha Plimpton) on a pastry<br />\nand a prayer.

He gets evicted, loses his<br />\nonly friend (who happens to be<br />\nhis father), and continues to<br />\nwander in a world he pretty much<br />\ncan't understand.<br />\nA certain loss of identity comes<br />\nwith illiteracy, and the finest<br />\nmoments of \"Stanley and Iris\"<br />\ncome when Stanley first tries to<br />\nconvey his problem to Iris. He<br />\ncannot take the bus or get a<br />\ndriver's license. He cannot open<br />\na checking account. \"Have I got<br />\na name if! can't read it?\" Stanley<br />\nasks.<br />\nRegrettably, that's about it as<br />\nfar as deep meaning or audience<br />\nengagement. It is inherently difficult for the filmmakers to convey the challenge of illiteracy, or<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\nfor anyone to appreciate the scope<br />\nor nature of the problem. Stanley<br />\nand Iris proceed with the delicate<br />\ndance of his education, but the<br />\nfilm never really lives up to the<br />\ngreatness of the problem.<br />\nThere's more than a few<br />\nassembly line aspects to \"Stanley<br />\nand Iris,\" beyond the fact that<br />\nthey both work in a pastry factory. The screenplay, by Harriet<br />\nFrank and Irving Ravetch, has<br />\n\"rewrite\" written all over it.<br />\nDirector Martin Ritt (\"Norma<br />\nRae,\" \"Nuts\")tries to nudge the<br />\nfilm along, but he elicits nothing<br />\nbut the flattest of readings from<br />\nDeNiro and Fonda.<br />\nDeNiro has tried these roles<br />\nbefore, but Stanley Cox is simply a waste of his talent. (Did he<br />\nforget how to read in preparation<br />\nfor this role'?) There's no rage or<br />\npassion in his work; it's practically numbing. As for the doe-eyed<br />\nFonda, her melodramatics, unfortunately, fit the material.<br />\nStanley's inevitable attachment<br />\nto Iris's son, like all other<br />\nsubplots, is limited to one scene.<br />\nThe sister and brother-in-law<br />\ndisappear from the film about<br />\nhalfway through. And Iris's unwed daughter, halfway through a<br />\nhigh school pregnancy, drops out<br />\nof school to begin working in the<br />\nfactory. Huh? This film was<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nRobert DeNiro and Jane Fonda in \"Stanley and Iris\"<br />\nedited with a hatchet.<br />\nIn an effort to make the<br />\ncharacters stand out from their<br />\nmontonous nine-to-five existence,<br />\nthey either say things that are<br />\nunbelievably stupid or embarassingly profound. It's awkward in<br />\neither case. When the family<br />\nstarts to act up at the dinner table,<br />\nIris chides her sister, \"We're all<br />\nin the same lifeboat\u2014don't rock<br />\nit.\" This is one adult talking to<br />\nanother!<br />\n\"Stanley and Iris\" makes such<br />\nan effort to stress the<br />\nincarceration-like aspects of the<br />\ncharacter's lives that any attempts<br />\nto inflate them beyond ordinary<br />\nstature seems akin to glorifying<br />\ncriminals. Everyone hates his<br />\n<br />\njob, yearns for more self-esteem,<br />\nand something beyond the<br />\nassembly line.<br />\n\"This is my prison,\" the<br />\ncharacters repeatedly insist. But<br />\n<br />\nin this battle of boredom, the audience is likely to emerge the<br />\nprisoner cramped in an uncomfortable theater chair during this<br />\nforgettable film.<br />\n<br />\nSTANLEY AND IRIS<br />\nDirected by Martin Ritt<br />\nWritten by Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch<br />\nBased on a novel by Pat Barker<br />\nProduced by Arlene Sellers and Alex Winitsky<br />\nExecutive Producer Patrick Palmer<br />\nDirector of Photography Donald McAlpine,<br />\nA.S.

What were you doing with the material?<br />\nA lot of editing.<br />\nHow much material did you<br />\nhave?<br />\n50 hours.<br />\nWhat sort of choices did you<br />\nmake?<br />\nFirst of all, we started with the<br />\nstuff that was in focus. So that cut<br />\n<br />\nabout half the film out right there.<br />\nAnd then I had to figure out how<br />\nto fit it into the story line, keeping in mind that it was a dark<br />\ncomedy. A lot of the serious stuff<br />\nwere the things that were<br />\nrepetitive. I didn't want to make<br />\nthe same point three times. I just<br />\nwanted to get in and get out.<br />\nDid you have a storyboard?<br />\nNo, not really. I put all the<br />\nscenes on index cards, and then<br />\nhad a big bulletin board, and I<br />\nshifted them around.<br />\nDid you ever think Roger Smith<br />\nwas going to come to Flint?<br />\nOh, yeah. I thought he would.<br />\nI always told the film crew, \"get<br />\nready.\" I thought he'd call our<br />\nbluff, but he never did.<br />\nOther than that, were there any<br />\nevents that changed what you had<br />\nthought when you began making<br />\nthe film?<br />\nNo, but you don't know Miss<br />\nMichigan is going to become<br />\nMiss America, you don't know<br />\nthe Nightline van is going to be<br />\nstolen, you don't know a lot of<br />\nthings. You've just got to be<br />\nthere, be reading the paper, watching what's going on. The film<br />\n<br />\nends up pretty much what I<br />\nthought it would.<br />\nIt seems that with some of those<br />\nevents, that they were almost too<br />\ngood to be true. Miss Michigan,<br />\nfor example. You must have been<br />\nexcited when she said, \"I'm for<br />\nemployment.\"<br />\nNot at the time. Because, you<br />\nknow, in terms of her, guys like<br />\nme are always nervous around<br />\npretty girls. You're trying not to<br />\nlook like an asshole.<br />\nShe looked pretty nervous.<br />\nYou think so?<br />\nShe was shaking.<br />\nReally? She didn't seem that<br />\nway at the time. She seemed really cool to me.<br />\nIt's almost as if she could sense<br />\nsomething coming, that she<br />\nwasn't....<br />\nWell, she's sifting, because the<br />\nwhole time she's thinking, \"don't<br />\nblow it, don't blow it, Miss<br />\nAmerica, Miss America.\"<br />\nWhen I've seen the film\u2014I've<br />\nseen it twice now\u2014the audience<br />\nseemed to be laughing at a lot of<br />\nthese people.

Park<br />\nThe twenty stories in Stephen<br />\nDixon's eleventh book, \"Love<br />\nand Will,\" are informed by a<br />\nterse, overridingly sharp, urban<br />\nsensibility and painted with a<br />\npalette of styles impressive both<br />\nfor their diversity and their ability<br />\n<br />\nto startle. In his best stories, Dixon reveals a forceful and uncanny ability to subvert reality,<br />\nrendering powerful, elliptical<br />\nmovements of the mind and heart<br />\nwhere the past unfurls concurrently with the present, or the implausible becomes suddenly intimate. He can take a seemingly<br />\nmundane event and twist it until<br />\nit takes on an entirely new, mordant significance.

But it's also<br />\nabout revolution, betrayal, and<br />\npower. Pynchon realized the<br />\npotency of film early on. His first<br />\nnovel,\"V\"(1963), featured entire chapters narrated in jumpcuts, close-ups, and wide-angle<br />\npans, while large portions of<br />\n\"Gravity's Rainbow\" (1973)<br />\nseemed to consist entirely of<br />\n<br />\ngrainy, often surreal, film clips<br />\nrandomly spliced together into<br />\nlong reels. In \"Vineland,\" the<br />\nmetaphor, amplified by the proliferation of television, reaches its<br />\nfull depth and its sharpest resolution. In 1984 (and Orwellian<br />\ncomparisons are entirely appropriate) television has completely and seamlessly permeated<br />\nNorth America's collective unconscious. It's become an integral<br />\npart of our thought process, a<br />\nparallel reality at times more<br />\n\"real\" than the one it imitates.<br />\nIt's not uncommon, for example,<br />\nto hear a person discuss his or her<br />\nlife as though it were a made-forTV docudrama.

I don't know if that's<br />\njust my school ... or did you get<br />\nthe sense that these people were<br />\nbeing lampooned?<br />\nWell, no, that's not the way I<br />\nintended it. People laugh for a lot<br />\nof different reasons. They laugh<br />\nbecause they're nervous, , they<br />\nlaugh because they don't want to<br />\ncry.<br />\nSometimes you'll get yuppies,<br />\nor children of yuppies, laughing<br />\nat the people. And I always like<br />\nthat because the non-yuppies in<br />\nthe audience get real mad at the<br />\nyuppies for laughing, and sort of<br />\ncreates a political action within<br />\nthe audience. It generates more<br />\nhatred towards the yuppies,<br />\nwhich I think is a healthy thing.<br />\nYou have used the phrase<br />\n\"economic violence\" to describe<br />\nthe situation in Flint. It immediately stuck in my head<br />\nbecause I've heard Jesse Jackson<br />\nuse that phrase. And you've mentioned that Flint's political<br />\npreference has switched to Jesse.<br />\nHow do you feel about him?<br />\nHe's a good guy. I think he's<br />\nabout all we've got in terms of a<br />\npolitical opposition in this country. National politics is very<br />\ndiscouraging. I mean, I think we<br />\nreally have a one-party system in<br />\nthis country. With two heads, but<br />\nthey're essentially both saying the<br />\nsame thing.<br />\nYou did the editing on \"Roger<br />\nand Me\"in Washington. Did that<br />\nchange any of your opinions?<br />\nThat's a good question. I don't<br />\nknow how much it affected us. It<br />\nwas probably best to be out of<br />\nFlint, because you are too close<br />\nto it . . . . we certainly were a lot<br />\nmore tuned into things on a national political level living in<br />\nWashington. The shop talk<br />\naround Washington, it's very<br />\ndifferent.<br />\nAnd the scene where the rabbit is<br />\nclubbed\u2014have you taken some<br />\n<br />\nheat for that?<br />\nYeah. I tell people to look<br />\naway, but [to) listen to what she's<br />\nsaying. It's there because it happened. And my camera not being<br />\nthere didn't make it not happen.<br />\nWe didn't know she was going to<br />\ndo it.

The bunny lady's on the<br />\nlocal rock station doing<br />\npromotions.<br />\nWhat sort of projects are you<br />\nworking on now?<br />\nNothing\u2014just trying to get<br />\nthrough this tour. I've got four or<br />\nfive ideas of other films I'll start<br />\nworking on. Some documentaries, some fiction.

I mean, it's<br />\nimportant for the film if it means<br />\nmore people will go see the film.<br />\nThen I'm happy. I'm not opposed to the Oscars, I'm not a snob<br />\nabout it, but I didn't make this<br />\nmovie to win an Academy<br />\nAward. And I frankly don't<br />\nbelieve it will be nominated, in<br />\nany category.<br />\nYou've been on all the talk shows<br />\nrecently. What's David Letterman<br />\nlike?<br />\nVery nice guy. Very nice to<br />\nme, he liked the film. He's a fun-<br />\n<br />\nny guy. I enjoy watching his<br />\nshow.<br />\nAnything goofy on the set?<br />\nHijinks?<br />\nJust Biff (stage manager Biff<br />\nHenderson]. Biff, a great<br />\nAmerican.

I asked him to get me some<br />\nwater, and I thought it was<br />\nregular water, but it was Perrier.<br />\nAnd I said, \"Biff, what are you<br />\ndoing handing out Perrier?\"<br />\nIt was pretty uneventful. The<br />\nwriters all came down. They'd all<br />\nseen the movie\u2014they really liked the movie. Letterman saw it<br />\nthat day. The writers had seen it<br />\nlong before.<br />\nAre you still up in Flint a lot?<br />\nI'm going up in the morning.<br />\nI'll be there for the weekend.<br />\nYeah, I'm there as often as I can<br />\nget there.<br />\nSo is that where you'll be working on the next project?<br />\nNo, I'll go wherever I need to<br />\ngo. But I still consider that home,<br />\nand I like to spend as much time<br />\nthere as I can.<br />\nI wanted to ask you something<br />\nabout college. But you dropped<br />\nout?<br />\n<br />\nYeah, I went for a year to U.<br />\nof M. University of Michigan.<br />\nThe big campus? Ann Arbor?<br />\nNo, no. Better make that clear.<br />\nThose people in Ann Arbor don't<br />\nlike that, if you went to the Flint<br />\nbranch. [laughs] School's pretty<br />\nboring. I hate to say it, but you<br />\ngotta do what you think is best for<br />\nyourself. A lot of times I think it's<br />\na waste.<br />\nNow tell me something about<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Is there a film<br />\nschool?<br />\nNo. Is that something you would<br />\nsuggest to someone who is interested in film?<br />\nNo. Don't go! Save the money.<br />\nWhat would you do if you were<br />\ninterested in film, and you were<br />\ngraduatingfrom school in a year,<br />\nand you didn't know what to do?<br />\nI think the most important thing<br />\nin a movie is the script. Lots of<br />\ngood actors, lots of good directors, lots of lousy scripts. That's<br />\nwhere the movie usually falls<br />\napart. So I think if you're a good<br />\nwriter, if you can write a good<br />\nscript, that's the key thing. And<br />\nthen I would just try to make your<br />\nown movie, do it as low budget<br />\nas possible.<br />\n<br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nReviewer's Note:<br />\nIn my discussion of Nathan<br />\nPotter's play, \"Rubber<br />\nBullets,\" in the Theatre Lab<br />\nreview [News-Letter, Feb. 9],<br />\nI used the phrase \"obviously<br />\nplagiarized elements from 'Taxi<br />\nDriver.\" While I admit to<br />\nwriting these words in draft, I<br />\nrealized their inaccuracy and<br />\nrequested that the Arts Editor<br />\nchange this sentence. Due to<br />\nsome unavoidable confusion,<br />\nhowever, the text remained as<br />\nit was in the draft.<br />\nilmierstand that Mr. Potter<br />\n<br />\nmeant certain scenes to reflect<br />\nthe obsession of his protagonist,<br />\nAlex, with the film. My point<br />\nin the review was simply that<br />\nbecause these scenes seem<br />\nlargely unmotivated, and<br />\nbecause Alex does not seem to<br />\nbe a strong enough character to<br />\ncreate them on his own, the<br />\nduplications come across as<br />\ngratuitous \"loans\" from the<br />\nfilm.<br />\nI apologize for any assault on<br />\nMr. Potter's character.<br />\n\u2014Christopher T. McColl<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/15<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\n<br />\nGeology in the park<br />\nby Dan Grossman<br />\nOn a cool November day, the<br />\ntrees shedding their leaves for<br />\nwinter, Professor Laurie Hardy<br />\nled eight geology students, myself<br />\namong them, into the depths of<br />\nWyman Park, adjacent to the<br />\nHomewood Campus. Also with<br />\nus was our lab instructor, Lydon,<br />\na graduate student originally from<br />\nJackson Hole, Wyoming. Hardie<br />\ncarried a shovel over his shoulder<br />\nas he led us students across the<br />\ndangerous San Martin Drive,<br />\nwhere cars swing around tight<br />\ncurves at high velocities. In the<br />\ncloud-dampened light, with his<br />\npointed gray beard and glasses,<br />\nhe looked to me like a younger,<br />\nmore intellectually vibrant version of Moses.<br />\n\"This park's a refuge for kids<br />\nplaying hookey as well as a place<br />\nof interest for geologists,\" he<br />\nsaid, revealing a dry, sardonic<br />\nwit.<br />\nAs we descended on a dim path<br />\nthrough the woods at the park's<br />\nperiphery, then crossed a bridge<br />\nover Stoney Run, the creek that<br />\nruns through the park, we saw<br />\nevidence that the park was indeed<br />\na hangout for kids: a rope swing<br />\ntied to a tree over a stagnant pool<br />\nat streamside.<br />\nBut the reason why we geo-lab<br />\nstudents (or pebble pups, as we<br />\ncalled ourselves) had come was<br />\nnot immediately apparent; we had<br />\nto walk upstream along Stoney<br />\nRun in order to see the streambed and the slopes above where<br />\nbeds of ancient basalts and<br />\ngranites were formed more than<br />\na billion years ago. The reason<br />\nwe had come here, he said, was<br />\n<br />\nbecause the Baltimore topography<br />\nyields little naturally exposed<br />\nbedrock. It is only along<br />\nstreambeds where rocks, by a<br />\nstream's cutting action, become<br />\nexposed.<br />\nHardie led us up along a badly<br />\neroded streambank slope broken<br />\nby exposed tree roots and<br />\nweathered boulders. He walked<br />\nup to one of the boulders and we<br />\ngathered around. Hardie pushed<br />\nhis shovel deep into what looked<br />\nlike solid granite and then lifted<br />\na shovelful of crumbled rock for<br />\nus students to inspect.<br />\n\"It looks more like sand than<br />\nsolid rock,\" said Hardie. In fact,<br />\nthe material was rich in quartz,<br />\nthe main component of beach<br />\nsand. He explained to us that the<br />\ndecomposed rock we were looking at had been physically and<br />\nchemically weathered. The<br />\nmaterial in the shovel, he said, is<br />\nan example of the first step of soil<br />\nformation.

He explained<br />\nthat the rapid streambank erosion<br />\nwashes it all away before it can<br />\nform. \"The whole slope's moving into the stream,\" he said.<br />\nAs we walked farther up along<br />\n<br />\nthe streambed, we noticed other<br />\nminerals, besides quartz, that the<br />\nancient rocks had decayed into.<br />\nKate, a graduate student in the<br />\nDepartment of History, dug her<br />\nhands deep into a white powdery<br />\nsubstance formed by the chemical<br />\ndecomposition of granite.<br />\n\"That's Kaolin,\" Hardie said.<br />\n\"You can put it in your<br />\nmilkshakes, or if you have tummy trouble, swallow it.\"<br />\nHardie was joking but only to<br />\na point: the mineral kaolinite is<br />\nused by many fast-food chains as<br />\na milk substitute in shakes. It is<br />\nalso used in common digestive<br />\nremedies such a Kaopectate.<br />\nWe then walked down from the<br />\nslope and out onto a dry portion<br />\nof the granitic streambed.<br />\n\"Mainly, these rocks are<br />\nmetamorphosed and altered<br />\nvolcanic rocks,\" Hardie said,<br />\npointing to the streambed.<br />\n\"They're more than a billion<br />\nyears old.\" Some of the students<br />\nwere now scrambling off on their<br />\nown, identifying rocks and<br />\nminerals.<br />\nI peeled off a thin dark mineral<br />\nlayer' off one of the streamed<br />\nrocks and asked, \"Isn't that<br />\nmica?\"<br />\n\"That's right,\" Hardie said.<br />\n\"It's biotite\"(a dark, smokecolored mica). \"Look over<br />\nthere,\" he said, pointing to a pink<br />\nmineral about as big as a basketball embedded in the bedrock<br />\nnearby. \"Can you guess what<br />\nthat is?\"<br />\n\"Potassium feldspar?\" said<br />\nZenah Wilson, a senior History<br />\nof Science major.<br />\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"It's<br />\na huge specimen.\"<br />\n<br />\nJoon Lee<br />\n<br />\n\"Imagine the amount of the<br />\ntime this uncomformity spans,\"<br />\nLyndon said, pointing to the concrete retainer wall, perched on the<br />\nbedrock, preventing the softball<br />\nfields in Wyman Park above,<br />\nfrom slumping into the stream<br />\nbelow.' Linden, with his<br />\ngeologist's jokes, was referring<br />\nto the amount of time, unaccounted for by rock strata, between the formation of the rock<br />\nand the construction of the retainer wall.<br />\nWe walked on along the<br />\nstreamside, looking at the various<br />\nlayered rocks and digging up<br />\nsamples. I began to climb up a<br />\nsteep section of the streamslope,<br />\nin order to get a sample of some<br />\ninteresting looking orange ironoxide minerals eroded out from<br />\na slab of basement basalt. But my<br />\nmind was still on the retainer<br />\nwall. The amount of time<br />\nrepresented by the uncomformi-<br />\n<br />\nprevented me from falling farther<br />\nwhen my feet came into contact<br />\nwith it.<br />\nBy then we had had our fill of<br />\nthe rocks that underlie the foundations of the Homewood Campus. I brushed off the mud from<br />\nthe seat of my pants and followed the others back out towards the<br />\nbridge. Yes, it was back into the<br />\nworld of term papers, exams,<br />\nbooze, birth control, coffee, NoDoz, and volatile relationships for<br />\nus students. Then the thought occured to me: Where would we all<br />\nbe in a billion years? Somewhere<br />\nin jumbled bunch of mud-covered<br />\nfossils on a slippery streamslope? Gelatinous ooze in the<br />\nPacific? Radiant shreds of intelligent being somewhere in the<br />\ncosmic void? The possibilities are<br />\ninfinite, I thought, but difficult to<br />\ncontemplate without falling on<br />\nyour ass.<br />\n<br />\nty was almost incomprehensible<br />\nto me.<br />\nNevertheless, I was trying to<br />\nimagine it as I climbed up the<br />\nslope; a billion's worth of history<br />\nlocked up in the rocks beneath my<br />\nfeet. I didn't get too far though:<br />\neither in my imaginings or my<br />\nclimb up the streamslope. As I<br />\nneared the top, the ground suddenly gave out from under me<br />\nand I started sliding back down<br />\nagain towards the stream.

He calls his<br />\nhypothesis the \"core-fringelegume\" pattern, or CFLP.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Mintz, the<br />\nstaple of nearly every culture's<br />\ndiet s is some starchy carbohydrate, providing about threequarters of the calorie intake.<br />\nThis. starch, which Dr. Mintz<br />\nterms the \"core,\" varies between<br />\ncivilizations but is usually a local<br />\ngrain or some product of that<br />\ngrain. For example, in East Asia,<br />\ntne core is rice; in Native<br />\n<br />\nAmerican tribes, maize; in<br />\nEastern Europe, potatoes.<br />\nMembers of these groups find the<br />\ncore absolutely necessary to the<br />\nmaking of a meal. This may be<br />\nout of necessity, since most of a<br />\nsociety's nutrition typically<br />\ncomes from the core food. Rarely, however, is a CFLP society<br />\nso sophisticated as to understand<br />\nabout balanced diets and recommended daily allowances; the<br />\ndesirability of core food is usually<br />\ninterpreted simply through its<br />\nfamiliarity and taste. A person<br />\ndisplaced to a culture in which the<br />\nwill<br />\ncore is unfamiliar<br />\nsometimes suffer from malnutrition even if the local core is<br />\navailable. \"They just don't consider it food,\" explains Dr.<br />\nMintz.<br />\nAlong with the core, most<br />\ncultures serve what Dr. Mintz<br />\ncalls the \"fringe.\" Fringe is,<br />\nsimply put, anything that makes<br />\nthe core more palatable. The<br />\nfringe can take a wide variety of<br />\nforms; it sometimes contains<br />\nmeat, sometimes vegetables or<br />\nspices. The fringe also tends to<br />\nbe made of more \"exotic,\" or<br />\nharder-to-get ingredients. (Dr.<br />\n<br />\ntein in beans is not as efficientlyi<br />\nused by the body as is anitn41 protein, it is a good substiturewhen,<br />\nmeats are unavailable. Often, as<br />\na society develops, the animal<br />\nproteins are eaten by the upper<br />\nclasses, while the rest consume<br />\nmost of the legumes.<br />\nThis stratification process and<br />\nits effects are an important<br />\nmotivation to anthropological<br />\nfood research. Since industrialized, wealthy nations can provide<br />\na choice of diets, consumers<br />\nnaturally select products near the<br />\ntop of the food chain\u2014especially<br />\ncultivated livestock. Land that<br />\nwould otherwise have been used<br />\nto raise grains for human consumption is therefore used to<br />\nraise feed; still more land goes to<br />\nthe raising of the animals<br />\nthemselves. The net result is a<br />\nluxury that takes on an enormous<br />\nscale. \"For every mouthful of<br />\ngrain we eat,\" says Dr. Mintz,<br />\n\"somewhere, we have taken two<br />\nmouthfuls of grain from someone<br />\nelse.\" Any efforts toward a solution to these problems, however,<br />\nmust begin with awareness and<br />\nknowledge. Dr. Mintz's research<br />\nhas provided a much-needed first<br />\nstep.<br />\n<br />\nMintz has suggested that religious<br />\nceremonies that center around<br />\nfood often focus on the fringe, using little or no core; this emphasizes the \"special\" quality of<br />\nthe fringe.) Examples abound<br />\neven in familiar ethnicities; as<br />\nItalians ladle tomato sauce over<br />\ntheir pasta, the Chinese add soy<br />\nsauce and vegetables to their rice,<br />\nand New Englanders pour maple<br />\nsyrup over their pancakes.<br />\nThe core and fringe are put<br />\ntogether in a variety of ways.<br />\nSometimes the fringe is poured<br />\nover the core at the table; other<br />\ngroups make a \"pocket\" out of<br />\nthe core (for example, pita bread)<br />\nwhich is filled with fringe foods.<br />\nStill others have their own techniques. Many cultures make a beer<br />\nout of the core grain as well. This<br />\nis commonly used at special occasions and celebrations.<br />\nTogether with the core and<br />\nfringe, most diets include a<br />\nlegume\u2014most commonly, beans.<br />\nThe legume is especially important in societies that consume little or no meat since beans are<br />\nhigh in protein. Legumes are, in<br />\nfact, often called the \"poor man's<br />\nmeat\"; while the vegetable pro-<br />\n<br />\nAllied Health Professionals<br />\n<br />\nSTEP UP TO TODAY'S<br />\nAIR FORCE.<br />\nDiscover a challenging future with opportunities for professional growth.

The team competed in the fourth division, and<br />\nsurprised almost everyone at the<br />\nHowe Cup by tying Smith College for top honors. The tournament is divided into four divisions, with teams being seeded<br />\naccording to their records and<br />\nlevel of competition throughout<br />\nthe year.

He went on to say<br />\nthat the fact that the team defeated<br />\nthree teams at the Howe Cup that<br />\nhad defeated them earlier in the<br />\nyear really illustrates the amount<br />\nof improvement the team has<br />\nundergone.<br />\nThe Jays arrived at Yale last<br />\nFriday and began preparing for<br />\ntheir first match against<br />\nWesleyan. Said sophomore<br />\nJessica Trcp p, \"We came into<br />\n<br />\nthe tournament a little skeptical,<br />\nbut we had a good overall<br />\nattitude\u2014we had nothing to lose<br />\nand nowhere to go but up.\"<br />\nEchoing these sentiments, senior<br />\ncaptain Kathryn Ng stated,\"We<br />\ndecided to take each match one<br />\nat a time.\" The positive attitude<br />\npaid off, as the squad posted a 7-2<br />\nvictory over Wesleyan.<br />\nThis victory is made even more<br />\nimpressive when one considers<br />\nthat Wesleyan beat Hopkins 7-2<br />\nearlier in the year. Later, on Friday, the team beat Bates 6-3, a<br />\nteam they had lost to 5-4 earlier<br />\nin the season. \"After those two<br />\nwins on Friday against the top-<br />\n<br />\nseeded teams, we began to realize<br />\nwe had a good chance of winning our division,\" stated Tropp.<br />\nSaturday started with an impressive 8-1 victory over Mt.<br />\nHolyoke College. The team carried their gathering momentum<br />\ninto the fourth match against<br />\nConnecticut College and came<br />\naway with a 6-3 victory. On Sunday the team trounced Haverford<br />\nfor the second time this year with<br />\na 7-2 score. \"The bottom half of<br />\nour line-up really came through<br />\nfor us,\" stated Frank Cushman.<br />\nIn fact, the fourth through seventh<br />\nranked players went undefeated<br />\nthroughout the entire tournament.<br />\n<br />\n\"We are a very even team, which<br />\nallows us to win many matches<br />\nbecause other teams don't usually have as strong a bottom half as<br />\nwe do,\" continued Cushman.<br />\nHopkins' showing at the tournament is surprising due to the<br />\nyoung and inexperienced squad<br />\nthey carry. Seven out of the nine<br />\nplayers on the team are either<br />\nsophomores or freshmen, and<br />\nmany players have only a year or<br />\ntwo of court experience. Most of<br />\nthe teams Hopkins faced were<br />\ncomprised ofjuniors and seniors<br />\nSee SQUASH, 19<br />\n<br />\nwas point guard Dave Eikenberg.<br />\nHe had his best game of the<br />\nseason, both offensively and<br />\ndefensively, and possibly the best<br />\ngame of his career. The Hopkins<br />\ncoaching staff gave Eikenberg the<br />\nunenviable task of guarding Case<br />\nWestern's leading scorer, Ed<br />\nSaxon. Saxon was averaging 21<br />\npoints per game, including 28 ppg<br />\nover the last ten games. He had<br />\nrecently poured in 41 points in<br />\none game. Eikenberg held Saxon to 18 points on 8-of-19<br />\nshooting. \"We told Eik that he<br />\nI Saxon] was good, and he took<br />\nthe challenge,\" said Nelson. The<br />\nCase Western players were<br />\nequally impressed. \"Not one person has been able to stop him all<br />\nyear,\" said one player. \"He<br />\nusually just blows right by<br />\neverybody. We couldn't believe<br />\nhow quick your guy was.\"<br />\nEikenberg was equally impressive on the offensive end,<br />\nscoring a career-high 16 points,<br />\nalong with five rebounds and five<br />\nassists. The Jays often ran the<br />\nshot clock down to 15 seconds,<br />\nat which time Nelson would call<br />\nthe \"four play,\" in which the<br />\n\"four\" man, usually Eric<br />\nHastings, would set a pick for<br />\nEikenberg at the top of the key.<br />\nEikenberg would then beat his<br />\nman off the dribble, penetrate,<br />\nand either shoot or dish off.<br />\n\"When I penetrate, I just read<br />\nBill IZahnrs man. If he comes<br />\nover, I just dish it to Bill for the<br />\ncorner jumper. If he doesn't, then<br />\nI shoot.\" The strategy worked to<br />\nperfection, and the result was an<br />\n88-71 win. The Jays were able to<br />\nwin without having to rely on outside shooting. Andy Enfield had<br />\n27 points, and Gangemi added 14<br />\ndespite playing on a very sore<br />\nankle.<br />\nDespite Hopkins' tough<br />\nschedule, Coach Nelson has<br />\nplayed his bench less and less as<br />\nthe games become more crucial.<br />\nIn the Washington and Case<br />\nWestern games, for instance, only five players got more than 15<br />\nminutes of playing time.

For the second<br />\ntime this season, the team scored<br />\nabove the 4,000-point threshold<br />\nby shooting for 4,008 points out<br />\nof a possible 4,800.<br />\nAll of the Hopkins shooters<br />\nperformed well in the intense heat<br />\nand carbon-choked air of the<br />\npoorly ventilated indoor rifle<br />\nrange. Senior Larry Young<br />\nfinished his college career with a<br />\nstrong 920 point match; junior<br />\nMatt Fisher and freshman Andy<br />\nBernstein shot for 985 and 961<br />\npoints, respectively. Senior Matt<br />\nMayr, the team captain, fired for<br />\n1,002 points out of a possible<br />\n1,200, regaining his usual<br />\nnumber two position.<br />\nSenior Jim Kielkopf hoped to<br />\nbeat 1,100 points and set a record<br />\nscore in the last match of his college career. He was well on his<br />\nway to achieving that mark go-<br />\n<br />\ning into the last of his four standing targets.(One target contains<br />\nten bulls, or a possible 100<br />\npoints.) He had averaged in the<br />\nhigh 80s in his first three standing<br />\ntargets, but with only three shots<br />\nleft on the fourth target something<br />\nslipped, and Kielkopf let a shot<br />\nfly off target. The miss shattered<br />\nKielkopf's mental composure,<br />\nand the loss of concentration and<br />\nconfidence caused him to lost 20<br />\nout of 30 points over the last three<br />\nshots of standing positiondestroying his chance to beat<br />\n1,100 points. Kielkopf regained<br />\nhis composure in kneeling position and fired two record targets<br />\nthere, but he was forced to settle<br />\nfor a final score of 1,060 pointsfar below his goal, but a strong<br />\nshowing nonetheless.<br />\nThe 1988-89 and 1989-90 rifle<br />\nteams have been the strongest<br />\nHopkins teams in recent history.<br />\nLast year Hopkins came in second in the Mid-Atlantic Conference championship match, and<br />\nthis year Hopkins shot its highest<br />\nscoring season ever.

However, the two returning shooters, Matt Fisher and<br />\nAndy Bernstein, have shown<br />\nremarkable improvement this<br />\nyear, even challenging Mays and<br />\nYoung for the number two and<br />\nthree spots.

I hope Valentine's Day was<br />\npleasant for all. I, for one, never get tired of hearing the words,<br />\n\"I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know,\" \"Let's just<br />\nbe friends,\" \"I think you're really nice, but .. .,\" and, of course,<br />\n\"She doesn't hate you yet? Give her time, she will.\" Anyway,<br />\nit's time for another drink, so get those entries to the office by<br />\n1700 hrs, Wednesday or I'll take your heart and throw it through<br />\na wood chipper.<br />\n. Results: Being a newly born virgin, it was very difficult for me<br />\nto correct the quiz entries. I give my thanks to Dr. Ruth<br />\nWestheimer, Dr. Alex Comfort, and Dr. John Money, whose<br />\nlectures are the only thing I will ever remember from my sentence<br />\nat JHU. The definition section should be extremely helpful to<br />\nmany who lack the proper words to tell their loved ones what<br />\nthey would like.

In his letter of invitation to President Bush, Muller<br />\nsuggested two dates to give a<br />\nspeech at Hopkins\u2014the June 7<br />\ndate and Commemoration Day on<br />\nFebruary 22, the official end of<br />\nthe centennial year celebration.<br />\nThe President was unable to<br />\nspeak at the inauguration on June<br />\n7, sending Secretary of Health<br />\nand Human Services Louis<br />\nSullivan in his stead.<br />\nBush's decision in late January<br />\nto accept Hopkins' standing invitation to speak on February 22<br />\ncame as a surprise to the Hopkins<br />\nadministration.<br />\nThe University had solicited<br />\nmembers of the faculty and administration to participate in the<br />\nprocessional at the ceremony.<br />\nPrior to the White House announcement, about 500 faculty<br />\nmembers had responded to invitations. In the past, many pro-<br /><br />\nMike Blumhardt<br /><br />\nPresident Muller regretted that so few students were invited to Commemoration Day ceremonies. President<br />\nBush is the invited speaker for the 100th commemoration of Hopkins Medicine.<br /><br />\nfessors who returned confirmations nevertheless did not appeared at the Commemoration<br />\nceremony.<br />\n\"We expect very few no-shows<br />\nnow because Bush is speaking,\"<br />\nsaid Muller.<br />\nGeorge Bush will bring along<br />\nan extensive entourage of security<br />\npersonnel and media to the<br />\nHopkins campus, adding to the<br />\nlarge number already expected to<br />\nbe present at the speech.<br /><br />\nThe White House announcement in late January prompted<br />\nHopkins to move the Commemoration Day ceremonies<br />\nfrom the 700-seat Turner<br />\nauditorium at the medical institutions to the 1150-seat Shriver Hall<br />\non the Homewood campus.<br />\nAs with any appearance by the<br />\nPresident, special requirements<br />\nmust be met for the media.<br />\nSeating the White House press<br />\ncorps alone demands at least 100<br /><br />\nSee BUSH, 2<br /><br />\nin Henry's edition, \"write-ins\"<br />\nmust register with the Elections<br />\nCommittee \"at least 36 hours<br />\nbefore the opening of the polls.\"<br />\nIn response to sharp criticism<br />\nconcerning this restrictive clause,<br />\nHenry voiced the committee's<br />\nopinion that, under the current<br />\nsystem, the \"write-in\" process is<br />\ntoo easy to abuse. The committee felt that one should have to<br />\n\"make an effort\" to get elected.<br />\nCouncil Vice-President Petrina<br />\nHsi argued that in order to win<br />\nas a \"write-in\" significant effort<br />\nis involved, including getting in<br />\ntouch with enough voters, making sure they actually write down<br />\nthe name, and making sure they<br />\nhave spelled it correctly. Other<br />\nproblems cited by representatives<br />\nwere the possible abuse of the advanced standing to change the<br />\nclass in which one is elected, the<br />\ncut in signatures to only five per-<br /><br />\ncent of the total number in the<br />\nclass, and the inclusion of at least<br />\ntwo candidates' forums.<br />\nHenry agreed to address all of<br />\nthese concerns in the revised edition of the Constitution that he<br />\nwill present to Council next<br />\nweek. In closing, he added that<br />\nthe changes were intended to<br />\n\"make the elections process more<br />\nreal,\" hoping that if \"the candidates take the process more<br />\nseriously, the student body will<br />\ntake the process more seriously.\"<br />\nDiscussion turned to Commemoration Day ceremonies and<br />\nthe prospect of student attendance.

Our<br />\nmain goal is bringing the offensive behavior to an end,\" said<br />\nAndrea Perry, director of<br />\nResidential Life and a member of<br />\nthe Network.<br />\nThe network uses an informal<br />\nresolution process,as its primary<br />\nrole is as a support for the victim. According to Perry, \"The<br />\nadvisors are able to put victims<br />\nin touch with legal avenues and<br />\nmake a referral to the appropriate<br />\nadministrative office on campus<br />\nso that a formal complaint is<br />\nrecorded.\"<br />\n\"All the members of the Network have received some<br />\ntraining in the counseling of victims of harassment,\" according<br />\nto Perry. The main purpose of the<br />\nnetwork \"is to assist all members<br />\nof the [University] community<br />\nthat feel that they have been sexually harassed or are uncertain<br />\nabout whether they have been.\"<br />\n\"The Network is very anxious<br />\nto publicize its existence and encourages members of the community who are confronting an<br /><br />\nissue to take advantage of the support network,\" said Perry. She<br />\nwent on to add, \"Often times we<br />\nassist in figuring out whether or<br />\nnot they have been harassed. In<br />\nmany incidences, people are unsure if what has occurred is<br />\nharassment.\"<br />\nSexual harassment is not<br />\nalways as obvious as one would<br />\nbelieve. Harassment in the<br />\nuniversity environment encompasses more than just requiring<br />\nsexual favors as a prerequisite for<br />\nacademic success. It also comes<br />\nin many less blatant forms, including sexual teasing or jokes,<br />\neven slight physical contact.<br />\nBecause sexual harassment does<br />\ncome in many forms and varying<br />\ndegrees, many people choose to<br />\nignore it, fearing they may be<br />\nwrong; others are sure, but are<br />\ntoo embarrassed to talk with<br />\nanyone about it. According to<br />\nPerry, there is nothing to fear or<br />\nbe embarrassed over; everyone<br />\nhas the right to pursue their<br />\neducation in a conducive atmosphere. In reporting sexual<br />\nharassment one is merely asserting the rights one has under<br />\nUniversity policy as well as state<br />\nlaw.<br />\nThe University has a strict<br />\npolicy on sexual harassment: any<br />\nconduct \"which creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive<br />\nlearning or working environment<br /><br />\nis prohibited. The University will<br />\npromptly investigate complaints<br />\nof sexual harassment and . . . will<br />\ninstitute disciplinary proceedings<br />\nagainst the offending individual.\"<br />\nAlso, according to Perry,\"The<br />\nAdvisors Network is not primarily designed to help victims of<br />\nassault or rape.\" It is suggested<br />\nthat if one is assaulted that one<br />\ncontact either campus security or<br />\nthe police immediately and seek<br />\nmedical attention.

Under ordinary<br />\ncircumstances (ie: no Bush), there would have been more<br />\nthan enough seats available for the student body.

Recently, this prevailing<br />\nattitude has been made evident by<br />\nthe minimal involvement of<br />\nUniversity-owned apartment<br />\nresidents in the decision making<br />\nprocess regarding University<br />\napartment renovations. The committees set up to discuss these<br />\nrenovations included administrators from the Offices of<br />\nResidential Life, Auxiliary Enterprises, Housing, Facilities<br />\nManagement, and the Dean of<br />\nStudents. Initially, when this<br />\ncomprehensive committee met,<br />\nresident input was not effectively utilized. As far as can be<br />\ndiscerned, no appropriate resident<br />\nrepresentatives were included in<br />\nthe planning process. In fact, the<br />\nstudents on the original committee were chosen specifically<br />\nbecause they lived in off-campus<br />\nhousing and were hand-picked by<br />\nthe administration. As a result,<br />\nthese students considered only the<br />\ndisadvantages of living in University housing. In making changes<br />\nthat affect resident life, those<br />\nstudents most directly affected<br />\nshould have been consulted on a<br />\nmuch larger scale. Specifically,<br />\nstudents living in Universityowned apartments would have<br />\nbeen an ideal choice for additional student representation for<br />\nthis comprehensive committee.<br />\nCommunity Assistants, working for the Housing Office and<br />\nthe Office of Residential Life,<br />\nhave as one of their major responsibilities the role of liason between the University-owned apartment residents and the administrators of the Homewood<br />\ncampus for housing-related concerns. In light of this responssibility, it would have been appropriate to include Community<br />\nAssistants on the committee for<br />\nUniversity apartment renovations. Because of this omission,<br />\nideas form residents were not<br />\nconsidered. The following are<br />\nconcerns relayed to Community<br /><br />\nAssistants by current University<br />\napartment residents with regards<br />\nto the soon-to-be-available Bradford Apartments.<br />\n(1) Students will be held<br />\nresponsible for the entire apartment lease, paying per unit instead of the current method of<br />\npaying per bed.<br />\n(2) Eventual plans include forcing the tenant to commit to a<br />\n12-month lease instead of the current 9-month lease option.<br />\n(3) Students will be responsible for arranging their own<br />\nutilities. This will be an additional expense not accounted for<br />\nin the rent.<br />\n(4) Rental price estimates have<br />\nyet to be released for students and<br />\ntheir parents.<br />\nSome other concerns, in<br />\ngeneral, about the proposed<br />\nUniversity apartment renovations<br />\nare as follows:<br />\n(1) More apartment units<br />\nshould have been designated as<br />\nsingle-occupancy dwellings.<br />\n(2) Attention should have been<br />\npaid more to the overall quality<br />\nof student life than to the maximum number of students housed together.<br />\n(3) The current question over<br />\nmandated versus guaranteed<br />\nsophomore housing in the<br />\nrenovated Wolman and McCoy<br />\nApartments should be answered<br />\nonly after consulting students<br />\nmost affected by the plans.<br />\nThese are just a few of the ideas<br />\nthat have yet to be addresses<br />\nsatisfactorily. Future renovation<br />\nplans must resolve these issues.<br />\nClearly student involvement at all<br />\nlevels is crucial in planning for<br />\nresident life. It is not sufficient for<br />\nonly students outside of University housing to participate in the<br />\ndecision making process.<br />\nResidents, instead, should be actively involved from the beginning. While it is understandable<br />\nSee HOUSING, 6<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn response to the article written by Rebecca Garron which appeared in the last issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter: Ms. Garron states<br />\nthat the intention of her discourse<br />\nis to defend the 2x +1 cartoon<br />\nfrom \"misdirected, impassioned<br />\ncriticism.\" She begins her<br />\ndefense by questioning whether<br />\nor not the cartoon, a cartoon<br />\nwhich seeks to define a woman's<br />\nmerit solely on the basis of her<br />\nsexual attractiveness, is sexist.<br />\nThe call for \"all hate mail\"<br />\nscrawled beneath the cartoon<br />\nunderscores the fact that the<br />\nauthor's primary intention was to<br />\noffend. Mr. Podurgiel requested<br />\na response; I think he is getting<br />\nthat for which he asked.<br />\nMs. Garron goes on to<br />\nenumerate the responsibilities of<br />\nthe Hopkins community. She<br />\nstates that censorship in not the<br />\nanswer. She is completely correct. To address the issue at hand.<br />\nwhen we, not the Women's<br />\nGroup but for Hopkins students,<br />\nspoke to Dean Boswell, our intentions were as follows. We<br />\nwanted a letter to be distributed<br />\nto all students by Homewood<br />\nDeans stating that sexism should<br />\nnot be tolerated on the campus.<br />\nSecondly, we wanted a meeting<br />\narranged between the Spectator,<br />\nthe GRO, and the concerned<br />\nstudents so that we could determine the positions of all involved, why the GRO allocated<br />\nUniversity funds to support this<br />\nissue of the Spectator, and<br />\nwhether the GRO was aware of<br />\nthe cartoon in question.<br />\nIt was not these four students<br />\nbut Ms. Garron herself who calls<br />\nfor the SAC to \"pull its funding<br />\nfrom the Spectator.\" It seems that<br />\nMs. Garron did not bother to<br />\ngather the correct information<br />\nbefore she began her tirade. Firstly, it was not a \"special-interest<br />\ngroup\" which filed the complaint<br />\nagainst the Spectator but four<br />\nstudents, two of whom were<br />\nunaffiliated. Secondly, the goal of<br />\nthese students was not to stifle but<br />\nto draw out the issue of sexism.<br />\nThirdly, the Spectator is not funded by the SAC but an outside<br />\norganization. It was granted funds<br />\nfor only this issue by the GRO,<br />\nthus her call for SAC funding to<br />\nbe denied, besides suggesting<br />\ncensorship, is useless.<br />\nTo continue with Ms. Garron's<br />\nlist of reponsibilities: under item<br />\nnumber two, she attempts to shift<br />\nthe \"blame\" for this cartoon<br />\nfrom the cartoonist to the Spectator. My questions to Rebecca<br />\nGarron: Is the Spectator some<br />\namorphous mass? Is it not made<br />\nup of its contributors? Do they<br />\nhave no responsibility for their<br />\nsubmissions?<br />\nThe list is concluded with item<br /><br />\nnumber three, in which Ms. Garron attempts to redefine the<br />\ndefinition of special interest<br />\ngroups, claiming that all groups<br />\nshould be dedicated to combatting<br />\n\"all issues which divide the community.\" Perhaps Ms. Garron is<br />\nthe only student who has the time<br />\nand energy to devote to every<br />\nissue on campus; the fact that<br />\nmost students are busy with<br />\nclasses, etc. is the reason why<br />\nresponsibilities are divided.<br />\nMs. Garron does make one<br />\nuseful comment: \"if we can't<br />\neradicate prejudice in the containment of academia, we will be<br />\nunable to hinder its reproduction<br />\nin society at large.\" This is our<br />\noverall goal, not censorship, but<br />\nincreased awareness and eventual<br />\ndefeat of the prejudices that are<br />\nprevalent on the campus and in<br />\nsociety. Perhaps Ms. Garron and<br />\nothers like her should stop to<br />\nassess the correct information<br />\nfrom \"misdirected, impassioned<br />\ncriticism.\"<br />\nKelly King<br /><br />\nDear James<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAt the risk of joining what I<br />\nthink is a senseless enterprise, I<br />\nhave a few things I'd like to bring<br />\nup.<br />\nLook, James, you're a funny<br />\nguy and a talented artist, and your<br />\nwork in the past has been impressive. However, don't kid<br />\nyourself into thinking that you're<br />\nthe end-all and be-all of political<br />\ncommentary on this campus.<br />\nYour apology to your reading<br />\npublic in your first letter was<br />\nridiculous. Do you really believe<br />\nthat anyone at Hopkins relied on<br />\nyour cartoon every week? Don't<br />\nbe silly. If it was there, they read<br />\nit. If it was funny, they laughed.<br />\nOtherwise, you went largely unnoticed. It's been tested, James\u2014<br />\nvery few people can remember on<br />\nMonday what your cartoon on<br />\nFriday was about without prompting. Besides which, if you<br />\nreally wanted to provide for your<br />\nreading public after you left the<br />\nNews-Letter, you could have<br />\ntaken the Hopkins Spectator way<br />\nout, and postered campus, now<br />\ncouldn't you?<br />\nAs far as the censorship issue<br />\ngoes, you weren't censored, you<br />\nwere edited. I didn't see the cartoon, and quite frankly, I don't<br />\ncare to see it. The fact of the matter is that you have been on staff<br />\nat the News-Letter for four years<br />\nnow, and if you have any problem with the judgement of your<br />\neditors, you should have brought<br />\nit up before they were picked last<br />\nyear. Obviously, the number of<br />\npeople that feel as you do are in<br />\nthe minority there, otherwise,<br />\nBrown and Engler would not be<br />\nwhere they are now. And if the<br />\nLax player cartoon you published the week before all this started<br /><br />\nwas any indication, they probably<br />\ndidn't edit you because of the<br />\nsubject material, they probably<br />\nedited you because you weren't<br />\nfunny.<br />\nThis is not a dig, this is not an<br />\ninsult, it's just a point. All the<br />\ncomments made by the Lax coach<br />\nin the cartoon were hackneyed<br />\nstereotypical ideas that I have<br />\nheard since I got here, and the<br />\ndrawing was redundant. I did not<br />\nfear for the social harmony of the<br />\ncampus, I was not brought to<br />\nsome as-yet-unequalled ire, I just<br />\ndidn't laugh. It wasn't funny,<br />\nJames.<br />\nYou could argue, I suppose,<br />\nthat you weren't trying to be funny, that you were making a social<br />\ncommentary, a la Garry Trudeau<br />\n(parallel to be noted by the style<br />\nof the drawing). Well, Garry<br />\nTrudeau manages to be funny<br />\nwhen he makes his social commentary, and I have never known<br />\nGarry Trudeau to draw real people in his cartoon for the sole purpose of lambasting them, as you<br />\nhave done in the past (George<br />\nLerner, Andrea Perry, Steven<br />\nMuller, etc.). If this still does not<br />\nconvince you, James, show the<br />\ncartoon to Mr. Trudeau when he<br />\narrives in May and see what he<br />\nthinks.<br />\nBut I digress. James, every<br />\nweek, I turn in about 50-60 pages<br />\nof text, and I get edited down to<br />\nabout three. I'm hurt, I feel<br />\ncheated, but I turn in a new column the next week. Brown and<br />\nEngler leave in what they think<br />\nwill still be amusing, and<br />\nsometimes they're wrong. And,<br />\nif they decided to cut me<br />\naltogether one week, they would<br />\ndo it. Such is life.<br />\nBut then, no doubt you think<br />\nmy column is useless fluff. And<br />\nyou're right. I choose not to make<br />\nthe sweeping and important<br />\nstatements that you do. I would<br />\nimagine the whole approach to<br />\nyour cartoon is different. Certainly you would not allow them to<br />\nhack one of your panels every<br />\nweek. This is a given. Also, I<br />\nunderstand that each week,<br />\nBrown and Engler waited for you<br />\nto turn in your \"cartoon.\"<br />\nSingular. That is, if they didn't<br />\ngo with what you gave them, they<br />\nwent with nothing. This was not<br />\ntheir doing, it was yours. You<br />\nmight have given them an alternative, as the other writers at the<br />\nNews-Letter do. But you don't.<br />\nYou made editing, their job,<br />\nimpossible.<br />\nJames, why should you be the<br />\nonly writer at the News-Letter not<br />\nsubject to editing? The editors of<br />\nthe News-Letter are faced with the<br />\ntask of presenting an acceptable<br />\nNews-Letter to a politically<br />\nvolatile campus. With your last<br />\ncartoon, you presented them with<br />\na no-win situation. Either the<br />\npresumed racial subject matter<br />\nwould become the controversy,<br /><br />\nor you would. Very clever on<br />\nyour part, James, but it makes me<br />\nwonder whether you're reacting<br />\nthis way because you truly feel<br />\nwronged or because you're upset<br />\nabout being taken out of the<br />\nspotlight.<br />\nBy the way, was that your<br />\nValentine to the News-Letter in<br />\nlast week's issue?<br />\nChristopher T. McColl<br /><br />\nFree Speech<br />\nTo the Editors:<br /><br />\nAs a relative newcomer to The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, I<br />\nthought I might add perspective<br />\non the controversies over \"free<br />\nspeech versus an offensive<br />\nmessage\" debate. Before arriving at Hopkins in September, I<br />\nspent four years at Stanford<br />\nUniversity, where a serious<br />\ndebate concerning the same subject divided the campus along<br />\nsimilar lines. The main controversy was over whether the<br />\nUniversity should allow students<br />\nwith extremely offensive,<br />\negregiously inappropriate opinions to proclaim their cretinous<br />\nstupidity in posters in university<br />\ndormitories. One specific case involved Ujaama, the Black theme<br />\nhouse, which found a defaced<br />\nposter of Beethoven (who it is<br />\nbelieved was partially Black) with<br />\na racist epithet scrawled across<br />\nthe front. Various campus<br />\ngroups, most notably the<br />\nresidents of the house, were appalled; \"Clearly we do not have<br />\nto tolerate that sort of belittling,<br />\ndefaming, racist-motivated, irrational attack on the grounds of<br />\nfreedom of speech, do we?\" they<br />\nasked in outrage.<br />\nWell, as a member of a leftwing coalition most likely to<br />\nagree with this point of view,<br />\nnonethless I personally must<br />\ndisagree; we do have to tolerate<br />\nthat sort of thing. The forum of<br />\nideas that the various media provide us with should not be<br />\nregulated by the prevailing<br />\nfashion, or we may soon find our<br />\nopinions silenced as well. The<br />\nUnited States has not always been<br />\na land where people could speak<br />\nout against established points of<br />\nview. A congressman from my<br />\nhome state, J.Q. Adams<br />\n(previously U.S. President), was<br />\nrepeatedly refused the right to<br />\nspeak in Congress in the 1830's<br />\nand 40's against slavery. Adams<br />\nwaged an unending, unsuccessful<br />\nbattle against the infamous \"gag<br />\nrule.\" His views were not allowed to be aired, because they offended the sensitivities of the<br />\nSoutherners and their peculiar institution.<br />\nNowadays, it is easy to say that<br />\nall races should be treated equally. To think otherwise is difficult,<br />\nSee LETTERS, 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nLETTERS, from 4<br />\nto express otherwise is to risk<br />\nsocial ostracism, and that's great.<br />\nIt shows how successful those offensive people in the 50's and<br />\n60's were in changing people's<br />\nattitudes. However, when someone wants to cross outside of<br />\nour new version of the politically correct, it is his or her right to<br />\ndo so, and he or she should have<br />\nthe same access to the same<br />\nmedia that we right-thinking folks<br />\ndo. After all, without that, our<br />\nideas would never have become<br />\nwhat right-thinking folks are now<br />\nthinking. Just this week, South<br />\nAfricans received the right to<br />\nprint and say what they think.<br />\nWhite and Blacks were dancing<br />\nin the streets as uncensored<br />\nnewspapers rolled off the presses.<br />\nAnd if someday when the goodguys who are protecting us from<br />\nthe nastiness of offensive cartoons<br />\nwith racist and sexist messages<br />\nhave fallen out of favor, and the<br />\nevil-nasties are back in charge of<br />\ndetermining what the public<br />\nshould or shouldn't read, we, the<br />\nonce-again-offensive, may wish<br />\nwe had not established the precedent of easy censorship of difference of opinion, in the name<br />\nof protecting the offended.<br />\nJohn S. Mill once wrote, in On<br />\nLiberty, \"The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others,<br />\nor wanting in due consideration for<br />\ntheir welfare, without going the<br />\nlength of violating their constituted rights.\" And \"We have<br />\na right, also, in various ways, to<br />\nact upon our unfavourable opinion of anyone, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in<br />\nthe excercise of ours.\" Excercise<br />\nyour individuality. Tell the jerk<br />\nhow much you hate his cartoon.<br />\nDeprive yourself of the publication to show them how mad it<br />\nmade you.

His 1990 budget proposal<br />\nallocated less than 8% for all<br />\nhealth and education programs<br />\ncombined (1.5 billion dollars less<br />\nthan the 1990 budget proposed by<br />\nthe Reagan administration!). In<br />\nspite of all of the events in the<br />\nworld over the past year, his 1991<br />\nbudget proposes increasing the<br />\nmilitary budget again, while funding for higher education loan<br />\nprograms will be cut, again. This<br />\nman's sole public health accomplishment has been to create<br />\npublic hysteria over illegal drug<br />\nconsumption, at a time when illegal drug death rates and addiction rates are at their lowest in 15<br />\nyears. (According to former<br />\nSurgeon General Koop, in 1988<br />\nthere were about 2,000 cocaine<br />\nrelated deaths in the U.S. and<br />\n390,000 deaths from tobacco.) At<br />\nthe same time, the Reagan and<br />\nBush administrations have been<br /><br />\nrelentless in their political arm<br />\ntwisting in order to open foreign<br />\nmarkets to tobacco imports (i.e.<br />\nThailand). The domestic health<br />\npolicies of the past decade have<br />\nallowed such places as Italy, East<br />\nGermany, and Hong Kong to surpass the U.S. with regard to infant survival rates.<br />\nHopkins has had a somewhat<br />\nschizophrenic face since it was<br />\nfounded by a liquor-running<br />\nQuaker. Today these faces remain, personified by A.P.L. and<br />\nHopkins' notoriously cutthroat<br />\nfiscal policies(as recently criticized in the Wall Street Journal), and<br />\npersonifying the other face, as the<br />\nhost of the Albert Schweitzer<br />\nAward for Humanitarianism, and<br />\nby the University's fundraising<br />\nefforts for the United Way. It is<br />\nnot difficult to conclude which<br />\nface has invited Mr. Bush.<br />\nLes Roberts<br /><br />\nBush H<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nCommemoration Day is a<br />\nspecial occasion for the university. This is a time for all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community to celebrate and share in<br />\nthe great pride of our school's<br />\nfounding. Unfortunately, students<br />\nare not allowed to join in the<br />\ncelebration this year.<br />\nOn February 22, President<br />\nGeorge Bush will be addressing<br />\nan audience devoid of students in<br />\nShriver Hall. Although there<br />\nwere provisions made to allow<br />\nfor one representative from each<br />\nof the divisions of the school (one<br />\nfor the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences and one for the Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering), it is a<br />\ndefinite slight on the student body<br />\nand a statement on how the<br />\nperceives the<br />\nuniversity<br />\nundergraduate community.

This<br />\nrelationship, however, has been<br />\nseriously jeopardized. I sincerely hope that the University<br />\nchanges its attitude toward the<br />\nstudents of this school.

In general, Universityowned housing or buildings with<br />\nhigh concentrations of students<br />\ntend to be more tolerant of parties, hanging in the halls, or loud<br />\nmusic.

Tender<br />\ntales of the middle-aged working<br />\nclass are few and far between,<br />\nand for good reason: if they're<br />\naccurate, they're completely<br />\nuneventful.

Of course, he<br />\nwasn't having any problems at all<br />\nuntil the nosy Iris King (Jane<br />\nFonda) put her two cents in.<br />\nIris is recently widowed, raising her grade-school son (Harley<br />\nCross) and budding daughter<br />\n(Martha Plimpton) on a pastry<br />\nand a prayer.

He gets evicted, loses his<br />\nonly friend (who happens to be<br />\nhis father), and continues to<br />\nwander in a world he pretty much<br />\ncan't understand.<br />\nA certain loss of identity comes<br />\nwith illiteracy, and the finest<br />\nmoments of \"Stanley and Iris\"<br />\ncome when Stanley first tries to<br />\nconvey his problem to Iris. He<br />\ncannot take the bus or get a<br />\ndriver's license. He cannot open<br />\na checking account. \"Have I got<br />\na name if! can't read it?\" Stanley<br />\nasks.<br />\nRegrettably, that's about it as<br />\nfar as deep meaning or audience<br />\nengagement. It is inherently difficult for the filmmakers to convey the challenge of illiteracy, or<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\nfor anyone to appreciate the scope<br />\nor nature of the problem. Stanley<br />\nand Iris proceed with the delicate<br />\ndance of his education, but the<br />\nfilm never really lives up to the<br />\ngreatness of the problem.<br />\nThere's more than a few<br />\nassembly line aspects to \"Stanley<br />\nand Iris,\" beyond the fact that<br />\nthey both work in a pastry factory. The screenplay, by Harriet<br />\nFrank and Irving Ravetch, has<br />\n\"rewrite\" written all over it.<br />\nDirector Martin Ritt (\"Norma<br />\nRae,\" \"Nuts\")tries to nudge the<br />\nfilm along, but he elicits nothing<br />\nbut the flattest of readings from<br />\nDeNiro and Fonda.<br />\nDeNiro has tried these roles<br />\nbefore, but Stanley Cox is simply a waste of his talent. (Did he<br />\nforget how to read in preparation<br />\nfor this role'?) There's no rage or<br />\npassion in his work; it's practically numbing. As for the doe-eyed<br />\nFonda, her melodramatics, unfortunately, fit the material.<br />\nStanley's inevitable attachment<br />\nto Iris's son, like all other<br />\nsubplots, is limited to one scene.<br />\nThe sister and brother-in-law<br />\ndisappear from the film about<br />\nhalfway through. And Iris's unwed daughter, halfway through a<br />\nhigh school pregnancy, drops out<br />\nof school to begin working in the<br />\nfactory. Huh? This film was<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nRobert DeNiro and Jane Fonda in \"Stanley and Iris\"<br />\nedited with a hatchet.<br />\nIn an effort to make the<br />\ncharacters stand out from their<br />\nmontonous nine-to-five existence,<br />\nthey either say things that are<br />\nunbelievably stupid or embarassingly profound. It's awkward in<br />\neither case. When the family<br />\nstarts to act up at the dinner table,<br />\nIris chides her sister, \"We're all<br />\nin the same lifeboat\u2014don't rock<br />\nit.\" This is one adult talking to<br />\nanother!<br />\n\"Stanley and Iris\" makes such<br />\nan effort to stress the<br />\nincarceration-like aspects of the<br />\ncharacter's lives that any attempts<br />\nto inflate them beyond ordinary<br />\nstature seems akin to glorifying<br />\ncriminals. Everyone hates his<br /><br />\njob, yearns for more self-esteem,<br />\nand something beyond the<br />\nassembly line.<br />\n\"This is my prison,\" the<br />\ncharacters repeatedly insist.

So that cut<br /><br />\nabout half the film out right there.<br />\nAnd then I had to figure out how<br />\nto fit it into the story line, keeping in mind that it was a dark<br />\ncomedy. A lot of the serious stuff<br />\nwere the things that were<br />\nrepetitive. I didn't want to make<br />\nthe same point three times. I just<br />\nwanted to get in and get out.<br />\nDid you have a storyboard?<br />\nNo, not really.

In his best stories, Dixon reveals a forceful and uncanny ability to subvert reality,<br />\nrendering powerful, elliptical<br />\nmovements of the mind and heart<br />\nwhere the past unfurls concurrently with the present, or the implausible becomes suddenly intimate. He can take a seemingly<br />\nmundane event and twist it until<br />\nit takes on an entirely new, mordant significance.

But it's also<br />\nabout revolution, betrayal, and<br />\npower. Pynchon realized the<br />\npotency of film early on. His first<br />\nnovel,\"V\"(1963), featured entire chapters narrated in jumpcuts, close-ups, and wide-angle<br />\npans, while large portions of<br />\n\"Gravity's Rainbow\" (1973)<br />\nseemed to consist entirely of<br /><br />\ngrainy, often surreal, film clips<br />\nrandomly spliced together into<br />\nlong reels. In \"Vineland,\" the<br />\nmetaphor, amplified by the proliferation of television, reaches its<br />\nfull depth and its sharpest resolution. In 1984 (and Orwellian<br />\ncomparisons are entirely appropriate) television has completely and seamlessly permeated<br />\nNorth America's collective unconscious. It's become an integral<br />\npart of our thought process, a<br />\nparallel reality at times more<br />\n\"real\" than the one it imitates.<br />\nIt's not uncommon, for example,<br />\nto hear a person discuss his or her<br />\nlife as though it were a made-forTV docudrama.

I don't know if that's<br />\njust my school ... or did you get<br />\nthe sense that these people were<br />\nbeing lampooned?<br />\nWell, no, that's not the way I<br />\nintended it.

They laugh<br />\nbecause they're nervous, , they<br />\nlaugh because they don't want to<br />\ncry.<br />\nSometimes you'll get yuppies,<br />\nor children of yuppies, laughing<br />\nat the people.

I think he's<br />\nabout all we've got in terms of a<br />\npolitical opposition in this country. National politics is very<br />\ndiscouraging.

It<br />\nwas probably best to be out of<br />\nFlint, because you are too close<br />\nto it . . . . we certainly were a lot<br />\nmore tuned into things on a national political level living in<br />\nWashington.

I mean, it's<br />\nimportant for the film if it means<br />\nmore people will go see the film.<br />\nThen I'm happy. I'm not opposed to the Oscars, I'm not a snob<br />\nabout it, but I didn't make this<br />\nmovie to win an Academy<br />\nAward. And I frankly don't<br />\nbelieve it will be nominated, in<br />\nany category.<br />\nYou've been on all the talk shows<br />\nrecently. What's David Letterman<br />\nlike?<br />\nVery nice guy.

Save the money.<br />\nWhat would you do if you were<br />\ninterested in film, and you were<br />\ngraduatingfrom school in a year,<br />\nand you didn't know what to do?<br />\nI think the most important thing<br />\nin a movie is the script. Lots of<br />\ngood actors, lots of good directors, lots of lousy scripts. That's<br />\nwhere the movie usually falls<br />\napart. So I think if you're a good<br />\nwriter, if you can write a good<br />\nscript, that's the key thing. And<br />\nthen I would just try to make your<br />\nown movie, do it as low budget<br />\nas possible.<br /><br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nReviewer's Note:<br />\nIn my discussion of Nathan<br />\nPotter's play, \"Rubber<br />\nBullets,\" in the Theatre Lab<br />\nreview [News-Letter, Feb. 9],<br />\nI used the phrase \"obviously<br />\nplagiarized elements from 'Taxi<br />\nDriver.\" While I admit to<br />\nwriting these words in draft, I<br />\nrealized their inaccuracy and<br />\nrequested that the Arts Editor<br />\nchange this sentence. Due to<br />\nsome unavoidable confusion,<br />\nhowever, the text remained as<br />\nit was in the draft.<br />\nilmierstand that Mr. Potter<br /><br />\nmeant certain scenes to reflect<br />\nthe obsession of his protagonist,<br />\nAlex, with the film. My point<br />\nin the review was simply that<br />\nbecause these scenes seem<br />\nlargely unmotivated, and<br />\nbecause Alex does not seem to<br />\nbe a strong enough character to<br />\ncreate them on his own, the<br />\nduplications come across as<br />\ngratuitous \"loans\" from the<br />\nfilm.<br />\nI apologize for any assault on<br />\nMr. Potter's character.<br />\n\u2014Christopher T. McColl<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/15<br /><br />\nScience<br /><br />\nGeology in the park<br />\nby Dan Grossman<br />\nOn a cool November day, the<br />\ntrees shedding their leaves for<br />\nwinter, Professor Laurie Hardy<br />\nled eight geology students, myself<br />\namong them, into the depths of<br />\nWyman Park, adjacent to the<br />\nHomewood Campus. Also with<br />\nus was our lab instructor, Lydon,<br />\na graduate student originally from<br />\nJackson Hole, Wyoming. Hardie<br />\ncarried a shovel over his shoulder<br />\nas he led us students across the<br />\ndangerous San Martin Drive,<br />\nwhere cars swing around tight<br />\ncurves at high velocities. In the<br />\ncloud-dampened light, with his<br />\npointed gray beard and glasses,<br />\nhe looked to me like a younger,<br />\nmore intellectually vibrant version of Moses.<br />\n\"This park's a refuge for kids<br />\nplaying hookey as well as a place<br />\nof interest for geologists,\" he<br />\nsaid, revealing a dry, sardonic<br />\nwit.<br />\nAs we descended on a dim path<br />\nthrough the woods at the park's<br />\nperiphery, then crossed a bridge<br />\nover Stoney Run, the creek that<br />\nruns through the park, we saw<br />\nevidence that the park was indeed<br />\na hangout for kids: a rope swing<br />\ntied to a tree over a stagnant pool<br />\nat streamside.<br />\nBut the reason why we geo-lab<br />\nstudents (or pebble pups, as we<br />\ncalled ourselves) had come was<br />\nnot immediately apparent; we had<br />\nto walk upstream along Stoney<br />\nRun in order to see the streambed and the slopes above where<br />\nbeds of ancient basalts and<br />\ngranites were formed more than<br />\na billion years ago. The reason<br />\nwe had come here, he said, was<br /><br />\nbecause the Baltimore topography<br />\nyields little naturally exposed<br />\nbedrock. It is only along<br />\nstreambeds where rocks, by a<br />\nstream's cutting action, become<br />\nexposed.<br />\nHardie led us up along a badly<br />\neroded streambank slope broken<br />\nby exposed tree roots and<br />\nweathered boulders. He walked<br />\nup to one of the boulders and we<br />\ngathered around. Hardie pushed<br />\nhis shovel deep into what looked<br />\nlike solid granite and then lifted<br />\na shovelful of crumbled rock for<br />\nus students to inspect.<br />\n\"It looks more like sand than<br />\nsolid rock,\" said Hardie. In fact,<br />\nthe material was rich in quartz,<br />\nthe main component of beach<br />\nsand. He explained to us that the<br />\ndecomposed rock we were looking at had been physically and<br />\nchemically weathered. The<br />\nmaterial in the shovel, he said, is<br />\nan example of the first step of soil<br />\nformation. Then, after the rock<br />\ncrumbles into its various components, it forms substances that<br />\nlook more like soil than rock\u2014<br />\nthe second step of soil formation.<br />\nThe best example of the<br />\nphenomenon was underfoot: the<br />\norange clay-like substance that<br />\ncovered most of the streamslope<br />\nand stuck to our sneakers when<br />\nwe walked on it.<br />\nBut Hardie could not point out<br />\nan example of the final step of soil<br />\nformation because there was no<br />\ntopsoil to be found anywhere on<br />\nthe streamslope. He explained<br />\nthat the rapid streambank erosion<br />\nwashes it all away before it can<br />\nform. \"The whole slope's moving into the stream,\" he said.<br />\nAs we walked farther up along<br /><br />\nthe streambed, we noticed other<br />\nminerals, besides quartz, that the<br />\nancient rocks had decayed into.<br />\nKate, a graduate student in the<br />\nDepartment of History, dug her<br />\nhands deep into a white powdery<br />\nsubstance formed by the chemical<br />\ndecomposition of granite.<br />\n\"That's Kaolin,\" Hardie said.<br />\n\"You can put it in your<br />\nmilkshakes, or if you have tummy trouble, swallow it.\"<br />\nHardie was joking but only to<br />\na point: the mineral kaolinite is<br />\nused by many fast-food chains as<br />\na milk substitute in shakes. It is<br />\nalso used in common digestive<br />\nremedies such a Kaopectate.<br />\nWe then walked down from the<br />\nslope and out onto a dry portion<br />\nof the granitic streambed.<br />\n\"Mainly, these rocks are<br />\nmetamorphosed and altered<br />\nvolcanic rocks,\" Hardie said,<br />\npointing to the streambed.<br />\n\"They're more than a billion<br />\nyears old.\" Some of the students<br />\nwere now scrambling off on their<br />\nown, identifying rocks and<br />\nminerals.<br />\nI peeled off a thin dark mineral<br />\nlayer' off one of the streamed<br />\nrocks and asked, \"Isn't that<br />\nmica?\"<br />\n\"That's right,\" Hardie said.<br />\n\"It's biotite\"(a dark, smokecolored mica). \"Look over<br />\nthere,\" he said, pointing to a pink<br />\nmineral about as big as a basketball embedded in the bedrock<br />\nnearby. \"Can you guess what<br />\nthat is?\"<br />\n\"Potassium feldspar?\" said<br />\nZenah Wilson, a senior History<br />\nof Science major.<br />\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"It's<br />\na huge specimen.\"<br /><br />\nJoon Lee<br /><br />\n\"Imagine the amount of the<br />\ntime this uncomformity spans,\"<br />\nLyndon said, pointing to the concrete retainer wall, perched on the<br />\nbedrock, preventing the softball<br />\nfields in Wyman Park above,<br />\nfrom slumping into the stream<br />\nbelow.' Linden, with his<br />\ngeologist's jokes, was referring<br />\nto the amount of time, unaccounted for by rock strata, between the formation of the rock<br />\nand the construction of the retainer wall.<br />\nWe walked on along the<br />\nstreamside, looking at the various<br />\nlayered rocks and digging up<br />\nsamples. I began to climb up a<br />\nsteep section of the streamslope,<br />\nin order to get a sample of some<br />\ninteresting looking orange ironoxide minerals eroded out from<br />\na slab of basement basalt. But my<br />\nmind was still on the retainer<br />\nwall. The amount of time<br />\nrepresented by the uncomformi-<br /><br />\nprevented me from falling farther<br />\nwhen my feet came into contact<br />\nwith it.<br />\nBy then we had had our fill of<br />\nthe rocks that underlie the foundations of the Homewood Campus. I brushed off the mud from<br />\nthe seat of my pants and followed the others back out towards the<br />\nbridge. Yes, it was back into the<br />\nworld of term papers, exams,<br />\nbooze, birth control, coffee, NoDoz, and volatile relationships for<br />\nus students. Then the thought occured to me: Where would we all<br />\nbe in a billion years? Somewhere<br />\nin jumbled bunch of mud-covered<br />\nfossils on a slippery streamslope? Gelatinous ooze in the<br />\nPacific? Radiant shreds of intelligent being somewhere in the<br />\ncosmic void? The possibilities are<br />\ninfinite, I thought, but difficult to<br />\ncontemplate without falling on<br />\nyour ass.<br /><br />\nty was almost incomprehensible<br />\nto me.<br />\nNevertheless, I was trying to<br />\nimagine it as I climbed up the<br />\nslope; a billion's worth of history<br />\nlocked up in the rocks beneath my<br />\nfeet. I didn't get too far though:<br />\neither in my imaginings or my<br />\nclimb up the streamslope. As I<br />\nneared the top, the ground suddenly gave out from under me<br />\nand I started sliding back down<br />\nagain towards the stream. On my<br />\nslide down, I noticed some of the<br />\nminerals we had seen on our walk<br />\nalong the streambank.

He calls his<br />\nhypothesis the \"core-fringelegume\" pattern, or CFLP.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Mintz, the<br />\nstaple of nearly every culture's<br />\ndiet s is some starchy carbohydrate, providing about threequarters of the calorie intake.<br />\nThis. starch, which Dr. Mintz<br />\nterms the \"core,\" varies between<br />\ncivilizations but is usually a local<br />\ngrain or some product of that<br />\ngrain. For example, in East Asia,<br />\ntne core is rice; in Native<br /><br />\nAmerican tribes, maize; in<br />\nEastern Europe, potatoes.<br />\nMembers of these groups find the<br />\ncore absolutely necessary to the<br />\nmaking of a meal. This may be<br />\nout of necessity, since most of a<br />\nsociety's nutrition typically<br />\ncomes from the core food. Rarely, however, is a CFLP society<br />\nso sophisticated as to understand<br />\nabout balanced diets and recommended daily allowances; the<br />\ndesirability of core food is usually<br />\ninterpreted simply through its<br />\nfamiliarity and taste. A person<br />\ndisplaced to a culture in which the<br />\nwill<br />\ncore is unfamiliar<br />\nsometimes suffer from malnutrition even if the local core is<br />\navailable. \"They just don't consider it food,\" explains Dr.<br />\nMintz.<br />\nAlong with the core, most<br />\ncultures serve what Dr. Mintz<br />\ncalls the \"fringe.\" Fringe is,<br />\nsimply put, anything that makes<br />\nthe core more palatable. The<br />\nfringe can take a wide variety of<br />\nforms; it sometimes contains<br />\nmeat, sometimes vegetables or<br />\nspices. The fringe also tends to<br />\nbe made of more \"exotic,\" or<br />\nharder-to-get ingredients. (Dr.<br /><br />\ntein in beans is not as efficientlyi<br />\nused by the body as is anitn41 protein, it is a good substiturewhen,<br />\nmeats are unavailable. Often, as<br />\na society develops, the animal<br />\nproteins are eaten by the upper<br />\nclasses, while the rest consume<br />\nmost of the legumes.<br />\nThis stratification process and<br />\nits effects are an important<br />\nmotivation to anthropological<br />\nfood research. Since industrialized, wealthy nations can provide<br />\na choice of diets, consumers<br />\nnaturally select products near the<br />\ntop of the food chain\u2014especially<br />\ncultivated livestock. Land that<br />\nwould otherwise have been used<br />\nto raise grains for human consumption is therefore used to<br />\nraise feed; still more land goes to<br />\nthe raising of the animals<br />\nthemselves. The net result is a<br />\nluxury that takes on an enormous<br />\nscale. \"For every mouthful of<br />\ngrain we eat,\" says Dr. Mintz,<br />\n\"somewhere, we have taken two<br />\nmouthfuls of grain from someone<br />\nelse.\" Any efforts toward a solution to these problems, however,<br />\nmust begin with awareness and<br />\nknowledge. Dr. Mintz's research<br />\nhas provided a much-needed first<br />\nstep.<br /><br />\nMintz has suggested that religious<br />\nceremonies that center around<br />\nfood often focus on the fringe, using little or no core; this emphasizes the \"special\" quality of<br />\nthe fringe.) Examples abound<br />\neven in familiar ethnicities; as<br />\nItalians ladle tomato sauce over<br />\ntheir pasta, the Chinese add soy<br />\nsauce and vegetables to their rice,<br />\nand New Englanders pour maple<br />\nsyrup over their pancakes.<br />\nThe core and fringe are put<br />\ntogether in a variety of ways.<br />\nSometimes the fringe is poured<br />\nover the core at the table; other<br />\ngroups make a \"pocket\" out of<br />\nthe core (for example, pita bread)<br />\nwhich is filled with fringe foods.<br />\nStill others have their own techniques. Many cultures make a beer<br />\nout of the core grain as well. This<br />\nis commonly used at special occasions and celebrations.<br />\nTogether with the core and<br />\nfringe, most diets include a<br />\nlegume\u2014most commonly, beans.<br />\nThe legume is especially important in societies that consume little or no meat since beans are<br />\nhigh in protein. Legumes are, in<br />\nfact, often called the \"poor man's<br />\nmeat\"; while the vegetable pro-<br /><br />\nAllied Health Professionals<br /><br />\nSTEP UP TO TODAY'S<br />\nAIR FORCE.<br />\nDiscover a challenging future with opportunities for professional growth.

Later, on Friday, the team beat Bates 6-3, a<br />\nteam they had lost to 5-4 earlier<br />\nin the season. \"After those two<br />\nwins on Friday against the top-<br /><br />\nseeded teams, we began to realize<br />\nwe had a good chance of winning our division,\" stated Tropp.<br />\nSaturday started with an impressive 8-1 victory over Mt.<br />\nHolyoke College. The team carried their gathering momentum<br />\ninto the fourth match against<br />\nConnecticut College and came<br />\naway with a 6-3 victory. On Sunday the team trounced Haverford<br />\nfor the second time this year with<br />\na 7-2 score. \"The bottom half of<br />\nour line-up really came through<br />\nfor us,\" stated Frank Cushman.<br />\nIn fact, the fourth through seventh<br />\nranked players went undefeated<br />\nthroughout the entire tournament.<br /><br />\n\"We are a very even team, which<br />\nallows us to win many matches<br />\nbecause other teams don't usually have as strong a bottom half as<br />\nwe do,\" continued Cushman.<br />\nHopkins' showing at the tournament is surprising due to the<br />\nyoung and inexperienced squad<br />\nthey carry. Seven out of the nine<br />\nplayers on the team are either<br />\nsophomores or freshmen, and<br />\nmany players have only a year or<br />\ntwo of court experience. Most of<br />\nthe teams Hopkins faced were<br />\ncomprised ofjuniors and seniors<br />\nSee SQUASH, 19<br /><br />\nwas point guard Dave Eikenberg.<br />\nHe had his best game of the<br />\nseason, both offensively and<br />\ndefensively, and possibly the best<br />\ngame of his career. The Hopkins<br />\ncoaching staff gave Eikenberg the<br />\nunenviable task of guarding Case<br />\nWestern's leading scorer, Ed<br />\nSaxon. Saxon was averaging 21<br />\npoints per game, including 28 ppg<br />\nover the last ten games. He had<br />\nrecently poured in 41 points in<br />\none game. Eikenberg held Saxon to 18 points on 8-of-19<br />\nshooting. \"We told Eik that he<br />\nI Saxon] was good, and he took<br />\nthe challenge,\" said Nelson. The<br />\nCase Western players were<br />\nequally impressed. \"Not one person has been able to stop him all<br />\nyear,\" said one player. \"He<br />\nusually just blows right by<br />\neverybody. We couldn't believe<br />\nhow quick your guy was.\"<br />\nEikenberg was equally impressive on the offensive end,<br />\nscoring a career-high 16 points,<br />\nalong with five rebounds and five<br />\nassists. The Jays often ran the<br />\nshot clock down to 15 seconds,<br />\nat which time Nelson would call<br />\nthe \"four play,\" in which the<br />\n\"four\" man, usually Eric<br />\nHastings, would set a pick for<br />\nEikenberg at the top of the key.<br />\nEikenberg would then beat his<br />\nman off the dribble, penetrate,<br />\nand either shoot or dish off.<br />\n\"When I penetrate, I just read<br />\nBill IZahnrs man. If he comes<br />\nover, I just dish it to Bill for the<br />\ncorner jumper. If he doesn't, then<br />\nI shoot.\" The strategy worked to<br />\nperfection, and the result was an<br />\n88-71 win. The Jays were able to<br />\nwin without having to rely on outside shooting. Andy Enfield had<br />\n27 points, and Gangemi added 14<br />\ndespite playing on a very sore<br />\nankle.<br />\nDespite Hopkins' tough<br />\nschedule, Coach Nelson has<br />\nplayed his bench less and less as<br />\nthe games become more crucial.<br />\nIn the Washington and Case<br />\nWestern games, for instance, only five players got more than 15<br />\nminutes of playing time. The<br />\nresults have been good, however,<br />\nas the Jays continue to shoot well<br />\nSee MEN, 19<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br /><br />\nMen win four at NJIT<br /><br />\nHopkins Swimming<br />\nTop Times 1989-90<br />\n(through completion of regular season)<br /><br />\nWomen fencers remain at .500<br />\nby Bill Berger<br />\nThe Hopkins women's fencing<br />\nteam suffered losses Saturday to<br />\nWilliam Patterson and host<br />\nBrooklyn College.

I hope Valentine's Day was<br />\npleasant for all. I, for one, never get tired of hearing the words,<br />\n\"I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know,\" \"Let's just<br />\nbe friends,\" \"I think you're really nice, but .. .,\" and, of course,<br />\n\"She doesn't hate you yet? Give her time, she will.\" Anyway,<br />\nit's time for another drink, so get those entries to the office by<br />\n1700 hrs, Wednesday or I'll take your heart and throw it through<br />\na wood chipper.<br />\n. Results: Being a newly born virgin, it was very difficult for me<br />\nto correct the quiz entries. I give my thanks to Dr. Ruth<br />\nWestheimer, Dr. Alex Comfort, and Dr. John Money, whose<br />\nlectures are the only thing I will ever remember from my sentence<br />\nat JHU. The definition section should be extremely helpful to<br />\nmany who lack the proper words to tell their loved ones what<br />\nthey would like.
