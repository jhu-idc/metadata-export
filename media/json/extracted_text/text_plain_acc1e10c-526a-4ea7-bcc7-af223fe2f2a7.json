On the other hand,<br />\nif it is incompetent to lead rousingly, the<br />\nwhole glittering display is spiritless, the<br />\nparade is a flop, and the onlookers are<br />\ndisappointed.<br />\nA good campus newspaper should always be abreast and even a little ahead<br />\nof the current of campus life, attempting<br />\nto recognize trends in advance and to<br />\narticulate tangible opinions upon them, in<br />\nan effort to keep every one in step and<br />\nheading toward a definite goal.<br />\nThe march of campus events during<br />\nthe next year promises to be interesting<br />\nand significant.
