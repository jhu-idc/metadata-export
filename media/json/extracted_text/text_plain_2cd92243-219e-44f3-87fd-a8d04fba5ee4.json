This week we<br />\nshall relate the proper collegiate<br />\natmosphere that once prevailed<br />\nat the Hopkins and probably<br />\nwill again. Taking excerpts from<br />\nthe 1918 issue of the now-extinct<br />\n\"Student Life at Johns Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nArts Editor<br />\nBob Landau<br />\n....Photographer<br />\n<br />\nDave Malta.. .........<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nTom Smith<br />\n<br />\nJack Clock<br />\n<br />\nWe Need Women<br />\nA combination of a winning lacrosse team and the<br />\nawareness of summer vaction just ahead has seemed<br />\nto inject that undergraduate body with some kind of<br />\nspirit that has been lacking on this campus for many<br />\nyears and which appears to be anything but unhealthy.<br />\nWe submit, that if there is any way to make this a<br />\npermanent addition to the Hopkins campus, coeducation is it.<br />\nIn earnestness, we suggest that some committee<br />\nformed<br />\nto study such a prospect. It would seem that<br />\nhe<br />\nthe addition of women to a men's school would tio much<br />\nmore than boost the morale of the student body. It<br />\nwould most probably boost the academic standing of<br />\nthe undergraduate body by increasing the number of<br />\ntop applicants.<br />\nBut further, the University, we feel, may have some<br />\nresponsibility to the community to open its doors to all<br />\nqualified students who wish to attend. It is the only<br />\nuniversity of great stature in Baltimore, one of the<br />\nnation's largest cities. With this academic monopoly,<br />\nexclusiveness ought not be in order.<br />\nWe don't know what significant changes or expenses<br />\nwould be incurred to carry out this suggestion, but if<br />\nIt is a possibility, it certainly ought to be investigated.<br />\n<br />\nThoughts From Below<br />\nWe would like to suggest a further step in the<br />\nuniversity's program to cheer up its undergraduates.<br />\nCould it not cater to the discriminating taste of the<br />\nHopkins community and provide university funds to<br />\nonderwrite some really first class functions on campus?<br />\nThere has, for instance, been some rather nebulous talk<br />\nof bringing Ray Charles to Hopkins for a concert or a<br />\ndance. There is little doubt that he would draw a large<br />\nenthusiastic crowd; certainly no money would he lost on<br />\nsuch a venture. It would therefore cost the university,<br />\nin effect, nothing, were it to allow a student organization<br />\nthe funds to bring about an entertainment of this nature.<br />\nPerhaps our view is oversimplified but we see no<br />\nreason why money cannot be released to sponsor undergraduate affairs. If judiciously administered such a<br />\npolicy would be no financial loss to the university and a<br />\ngreat benefit to undergraduate morale.<br />\n<br />\nAre They Kidding?<br />\nJoe Permit\u00b0 informs us (see this week's correspondence) that he and the Cotillion Board are planning a big<br />\nweek end next spring. In spite of our enthusiasm at<br />\nthe prospect of a real college weekend at Hopkins we<br />\nmust register a cry of alarm at some of the proposed<br />\narrangements.<br />\nIt is hard to believe that a band as insipid as Ray<br />\nConnif's is being seriously considered. Should such a<br />\nlack of taste permeate the planning of the entire weekend<br />\nthe whole purpose of the event would be defeated.<br />\nEqually distressing are the projected financial arrangements, most of which appear tenuous indeed.<br />\nNeither the Administration nor the Alumni Association<br />\nis noted for its liberality in financing undergraduate<br />\naffairs, and to expect the local girls schools to pay part<br />\nof the costs is plain silly. Why should Goucher, Mount<br />\nSaint Agnes or Notre Dame invest in a function which<br />\nwill benefit a small fraction of their students at best?<br />\nThe Cotillion Board has a good idea on its hands.<br />\nIt would he a shame if it were to fail because of mismanagement and an unrealistic approach to the problems<br />\ninvolved.<br />\n<br />\nDignitas Pro Graduafione<br />\nWe are happy to note that the University has<br />\ninvited Julius Stratton, President of the Massachusetts<br />\nInstitute of Technology, to speak at commencement<br />\nexercises this June.<br />\nToo many universities have in recent years tried<br />\nto get the biggest political \"attraction\" available to address their June graduates. The University is quite right<br />\nin stepping out of this game.<br />\nGraduation is not a big show and should not be<br />\ntreated as a publicity gimmick. It is the culmination<br />\nof advanced studies and should he held with academic<br />\ndignity.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins men in days of old.<br />\n<br />\nPro Arte<br />\n<br />\nFour Artist Combination<br />\nAppears At Art Museum<br />\nBY WILLIAM BUSH .. ....v..<br />\nThe greater artist is the artist<br />\nwho can put into his art most<br />\nwhat he is. The four Parisian<br />\npainters Degas, Manet, Morisot,<br />\nand Cassatt, whose works are on<br />\nexhibit at the Baltimore Art Museum, are four greater artists, for<br />\none can read their sentiments in<br />\ntheir work. Each, besides creat-<br />\n<br />\neolaapandence<br />\nKudos From Perrotto<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs coordinating co-chairman<br />\nof the University Prom, I am<br />\nhappy to announce that the<br />\nProm was not only a social success, but also a financial one.<br />\nThe cost of the dance was approximately $6500, and the receipts were $6500: we had an<br />\nattendance of 1050 couples.<br />\nOf course, this dance, as all<br />\nother social functions at Hopkins owes its success to a group<br />\nof hard working fellows who are<br />\ninterested in seeing the social<br />\npart of the campus progress. A<br />\ngreat deal of thanks must go<br />\nto Charlie Van Beke, Zorel<br />\nParitzky, Lanney Berman, Lawrey Pollack, and Dick Rubin who<br />\ndid the promotion for the prom.<br />\nAnd much thanks must go to<br />\nBill Beck and George Kosmaler<br />\nwho designed our tremendous<br />\nposters. Our appreciation goes<br />\nalso to Clay Nagao for the<br />\nbeautiful decorations; to Dick<br />\nKesler who did a great job on<br />\nthe programs; to Ken Gertsen<br />\nfor getting the fellows who did<br />\nthe work at the Armory; to Walt<br />\nBraunholer and Dan Bronstein<br />\nwho took care of set-ups; to<br />\nTerry Sinclair for taking care<br />\nof table reservations, and a<br />\nmultitude of thanks to Fred<br />\nStoddard for the amazing efficient job he did in taking care<br />\nof ticket sales. Finally, I would<br />\nlike to thank the DSRC, the<br />\nH-Club, the Student Shop, the<br />\nI.C.C., the IFC, the SC, the<br />\nBooster Club, and last but not<br />\nleast, the News-Letter, whose<br />\nmembers sold tickets and publicized the event.<br />\nBig Weekend<br />\nSince the prom, the Cotillion<br />\nBoard has been considering put(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\ning a scene, portrait, or sketch,<br />\nputs his own stamp onto the<br />\nmaterial and reveals his or her<br />\nown sentiments.<br />\nMary Cassatt (1855-1926) is<br />\nthe only American of this Parisian school, and her art is the<br />\nmost superficial. She shows soft,<br />\nfeminine interests in her Subjects, mostly women of an upper<br />\nsocial circle or in the process of<br />\ngrooming. Her portraits are<br />\ntender and affectionate, especially the Caresse Enfantine, a<br />\nyoung girl gently kissing a baby<br />\nin her mother's lap. Yet beneath<br />\nthis Victorian facade and reserve, her figures do occasionally<br />\nshow some real depth \u2014not of<br />\nthe psychological penetration of<br />\nManet, but of a human tenderness.<br />\n<br />\nUniversity,\" we would like to<br />\nshow you some of the noble<br />\ntraditions after which we can<br />\npattern our future.<br />\n\"The college opens the first<br />\nMonday in October, and by<br />\nWednesday the freshman feels<br />\nhimself part of the new organism. He attends his first mass<br />\nmeeting; he feels the surge as<br />\nthe great crowd throbs with<br />\n\"Hullabaloo, Canuck, Canuck\";<br />\nhis blood warms as he learns<br />\nsuccessively 'On the line .<br />\nand 'Let's stand together ..<br />\nThen, indeed, does he really feel<br />\nthat he is a Hopkins man.\"<br />\n\"The President of the Student<br />\nCouncil enlightens (the freshmen) on the rules laid down by<br />\nupper classes for the conduct of<br />\nfreshmen:<br />\n1. Freshmen are expected to<br />\nknow the songs and yells in<br />\nthe Y.M.C.A. handbook before<br />\ntheir first class meeting.<br />\n2. Freshmen are not to ride in<br />\nthe elevator during the first<br />\nsemester. (???)<br />\n3. In crossing the campus, freshmen must keep to the walks.<br />\n4. Freshmen may not occupy<br />\nseats in the stand on Homewood Field other than in the<br />\nrooting section (?) unless<br />\naccompanied by guests.<br />\n5. No freshman may smoke<br />\nwhile in University buildings.<br />\n6. Freshmen may not wear their<br />\nhats in any University building.<br />\n7. Until their class shall have<br />\nwon two interclass contests<br />\nfreshmen shall wear the regulation freshman tie and cap<br />\nand black socks only.<br />\n8. Freshmen may enter and<br />\nleave Gilman Hall by the basement only.<br />\nIn conclusion, we might add<br />\nthis aphorism so fitting to stick<br />\nin the minds of all those products of our favorite University:<br />\n\"And all the way through college<br />\nand in after-life the Hopkins<br />\nman's ideal is summed up by<br />\nthe question: 'What can I do<br />\nfor the college, the country, the<br />\nworld?'\"<br />\n<br />\nMorisot and Manet<br />\nBerthe Morisot (1841-1895)<br />\nshows feminine interests similar<br />\nto Cassatt, but rather than the<br />\nlatter's superficial reserve, her<br />\nart has a reserve of sadness and<br />\neven loneliness. Her very candid<br />\nself-portrait is of a gentle, lonely and rather saddened artist.<br />\nThe eyes are blank but not all<br />\nlifeless. Her art shows Romantic<br />\ntendencies, frequently of solitary<br />\nindividuals, and subtle penetration into faces beyond Cassatt.<br />\n<br />\nOur Founder.<br />\n<br />\nCultural Events<br />\n<br />\nEdoard Manet (1832-1883) is<br />\na master of depth in a face.

We<br />\nestimate the cost of this WeekEnd to be $11,000. In order to<br />\nmeet this expense, we have asked<br />\nthe Administration for $3,000<br />\nand the Alumni Association for<br />\n$2,000. But even if we get this<br />\nmoney, we will not be able to<br />\nmeet the cost. Therefore, we feel<br />\nthat it is absolutely necessary<br />\nto increase class dues by at<br />\nleast two dollars. This would allow us a financial basis of approximately $6,000.The poll which<br />\nwas taken last week showed<br />\nthat of 545 students, 90% wanted the Week-end, but only 48%<br />\nwere willing to increase class<br />\ndues. Next week, the members<br />\nof the classes of '63. '64, and '65<br />\nare going to be asked to vote<br />\nfor or against the increase. From<br />\nthis, the Cotillion Board will be<br />\nable to tell if the students are<br />\nwilling to pay for the large<br />\nsocial event, which will include<br />\npeople such as the Limelighters<br />\nor Brubeck, and Ray Charles,<br />\nRay Coniff, or Glenn Miller.<br />\nIn seeking other ways of paying for this Week-end, I have<br />\ncontacted the president of the<br />\nstudent organizations at Goucher, Mae Mallory Spence, and<br />\nshe said that it is very possible<br />\nthat Goucher will increase their<br />\nclass dues by two dollars for<br />\nthe function \u2014 this would give<br />\nUs approximately $7,600, if our<br />\nclass dues are raised.

If the Johns<br />\nHopkins owes its eminence to its<br />\nintentness on freedom of research and self-propelled study,<br />\nit has been able to pursue this<br />\nideal with distinction largely because it has remained a small<br />\nuniversity and relatively free of<br />\norganizational burdens and of<br />\nwalls of partition between schools<br />\nand departments. In my time<br />\nthe undergraduate was benefitting too little by the comparative<br />\nabsence of such partitions.

This week we<br />\nshall relate the proper collegiate<br />\natmosphere that once prevailed<br />\nat the Hopkins and probably<br />\nwill again. Taking excerpts from<br />\nthe 1918 issue of the now-extinct<br />\n\"Student Life at Johns Hopkins<br /><br />\nArts Editor<br />\nBob Landau<br />\n....Photographer<br /><br />\nDave Malta.. .........<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nTom Smith<br /><br />\nJack Clock<br /><br />\nWe Need Women<br />\nA combination of a winning lacrosse team and the<br />\nawareness of summer vaction just ahead has seemed<br />\nto inject that undergraduate body with some kind of<br />\nspirit that has been lacking on this campus for many<br />\nyears and which appears to be anything but unhealthy.<br />\nWe submit, that if there is any way to make this a<br />\npermanent addition to the Hopkins campus, coeducation is it.<br />\nIn earnestness, we suggest that some committee<br />\nformed<br />\nto study such a prospect. It would seem that<br />\nhe<br />\nthe addition of women to a men's school would tio much<br />\nmore than boost the morale of the student body. It<br />\nwould most probably boost the academic standing of<br />\nthe undergraduate body by increasing the number of<br />\ntop applicants.<br />\nBut further, the University, we feel, may have some<br />\nresponsibility to the community to open its doors to all<br />\nqualified students who wish to attend. It is the only<br />\nuniversity of great stature in Baltimore, one of the<br />\nnation's largest cities. With this academic monopoly,<br />\nexclusiveness ought not be in order.<br />\nWe don't know what significant changes or expenses<br />\nwould be incurred to carry out this suggestion, but if<br />\nIt is a possibility, it certainly ought to be investigated.<br /><br />\nThoughts From Below<br />\nWe would like to suggest a further step in the<br />\nuniversity's program to cheer up its undergraduates.<br />\nCould it not cater to the discriminating taste of the<br />\nHopkins community and provide university funds to<br />\nonderwrite some really first class functions on campus?<br />\nThere has, for instance, been some rather nebulous talk<br />\nof bringing Ray Charles to Hopkins for a concert or a<br />\ndance. There is little doubt that he would draw a large<br />\nenthusiastic crowd; certainly no money would he lost on<br />\nsuch a venture. It would therefore cost the university,<br />\nin effect, nothing, were it to allow a student organization<br />\nthe funds to bring about an entertainment of this nature.<br />\nPerhaps our view is oversimplified but we see no<br />\nreason why money cannot be released to sponsor undergraduate affairs. If judiciously administered such a<br />\npolicy would be no financial loss to the university and a<br />\ngreat benefit to undergraduate morale.<br /><br />\nAre They Kidding?<br />\nJoe Permit\u00b0 informs us (see this week's correspondence) that he and the Cotillion Board are planning a big<br />\nweek end next spring. In spite of our enthusiasm at<br />\nthe prospect of a real college weekend at Hopkins we<br />\nmust register a cry of alarm at some of the proposed<br />\narrangements.<br />\nIt is hard to believe that a band as insipid as Ray<br />\nConnif's is being seriously considered. Should such a<br />\nlack of taste permeate the planning of the entire weekend<br />\nthe whole purpose of the event would be defeated.<br />\nEqually distressing are the projected financial arrangements, most of which appear tenuous indeed.<br />\nNeither the Administration nor the Alumni Association<br />\nis noted for its liberality in financing undergraduate<br />\naffairs, and to expect the local girls schools to pay part<br />\nof the costs is plain silly. Why should Goucher, Mount<br />\nSaint Agnes or Notre Dame invest in a function which<br />\nwill benefit a small fraction of their students at best?<br />\nThe Cotillion Board has a good idea on its hands.<br />\nIt would he a shame if it were to fail because of mismanagement and an unrealistic approach to the problems<br />\ninvolved.<br /><br />\nDignitas Pro Graduafione<br />\nWe are happy to note that the University has<br />\ninvited Julius Stratton, President of the Massachusetts<br />\nInstitute of Technology, to speak at commencement<br />\nexercises this June.<br />\nToo many universities have in recent years tried<br />\nto get the biggest political \"attraction\" available to address their June graduates. The University is quite right<br />\nin stepping out of this game.<br />\nGraduation is not a big show and should not be<br />\ntreated as a publicity gimmick. It is the culmination<br />\nof advanced studies and should he held with academic<br />\ndignity.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins men in days of old.<br /><br />\nPro Arte<br /><br />\nFour Artist Combination<br />\nAppears At Art Museum<br />\nBY WILLIAM BUSH .. ....v..<br />\nThe greater artist is the artist<br />\nwho can put into his art most<br />\nwhat he is.

A<br />\ngreat deal of thanks must go<br />\nto Charlie Van Beke, Zorel<br />\nParitzky, Lanney Berman, Lawrey Pollack, and Dick Rubin who<br />\ndid the promotion for the prom.<br />\nAnd much thanks must go to<br />\nBill Beck and George Kosmaler<br />\nwho designed our tremendous<br />\nposters. Our appreciation goes<br />\nalso to Clay Nagao for the<br />\nbeautiful decorations; to Dick<br />\nKesler who did a great job on<br />\nthe programs; to Ken Gertsen<br />\nfor getting the fellows who did<br />\nthe work at the Armory; to Walt<br />\nBraunholer and Dan Bronstein<br />\nwho took care of set-ups; to<br />\nTerry Sinclair for taking care<br />\nof table reservations, and a<br />\nmultitude of thanks to Fred<br />\nStoddard for the amazing efficient job he did in taking care<br />\nof ticket sales. Finally, I would<br />\nlike to thank the DSRC, the<br />\nH-Club, the Student Shop, the<br />\nI.C.C., the IFC, the SC, the<br />\nBooster Club, and last but not<br />\nleast, the News-Letter, whose<br />\nmembers sold tickets and publicized the event.<br />\nBig Weekend<br />\nSince the prom, the Cotillion<br />\nBoard has been considering put(Continued on Page 5)<br /><br />\ning a scene, portrait, or sketch,<br />\nputs his own stamp onto the<br />\nmaterial and reveals his or her<br />\nown sentiments.<br />\nMary Cassatt (1855-1926) is<br />\nthe only American of this Parisian school, and her art is the<br />\nmost superficial. She shows soft,<br />\nfeminine interests in her Subjects, mostly women of an upper<br />\nsocial circle or in the process of<br />\ngrooming. Her portraits are<br />\ntender and affectionate, especially the Caresse Enfantine, a<br />\nyoung girl gently kissing a baby<br />\nin her mother's lap.

He attends his first mass<br />\nmeeting; he feels the surge as<br />\nthe great crowd throbs with<br />\n\"Hullabaloo, Canuck, Canuck\";<br />\nhis blood warms as he learns<br />\nsuccessively 'On the line .<br />\nand 'Let's stand together ..<br />\nThen, indeed, does he really feel<br />\nthat he is a Hopkins man.\"<br />\n\"The President of the Student<br />\nCouncil enlightens (the freshmen) on the rules laid down by<br />\nupper classes for the conduct of<br />\nfreshmen:<br />\n1. Freshmen are expected to<br />\nknow the songs and yells in<br />\nthe Y.M.C.A. handbook before<br />\ntheir first class meeting.<br />\n2. Freshmen are not to ride in<br />\nthe elevator during the first<br />\nsemester. (???)<br />\n3. In crossing the campus, freshmen must keep to the walks.<br />\n4. Freshmen may not occupy<br />\nseats in the stand on Homewood Field other than in the<br />\nrooting section (?) unless<br />\naccompanied by guests.<br />\n5.

Freshmen may enter and<br />\nleave Gilman Hall by the basement only.<br />\nIn conclusion, we might add<br />\nthis aphorism so fitting to stick<br />\nin the minds of all those products of our favorite University:<br />\n\"And all the way through college<br />\nand in after-life the Hopkins<br />\nman's ideal is summed up by<br />\nthe question: 'What can I do<br />\nfor the college, the country, the<br />\nworld?'\"<br /><br />\nMorisot and Manet<br />\nBerthe Morisot (1841-1895)<br />\nshows feminine interests similar<br />\nto Cassatt, but rather than the<br />\nlatter's superficial reserve, her<br />\nart has a reserve of sadness and<br />\neven loneliness. Her very candid<br />\nself-portrait is of a gentle, lonely and rather saddened artist.<br />\nThe eyes are blank but not all<br />\nlifeless. Her art shows Romantic<br />\ntendencies, frequently of solitary<br />\nindividuals, and subtle penetration into faces beyond Cassatt.<br /><br />\nOur Founder.<br /><br />\nCultural Events<br /><br />\nEdoard Manet (1832-1883) is<br />\na master of depth in a face.

We<br />\nestimate the cost of this WeekEnd to be $11,000. In order to<br />\nmeet this expense, we have asked<br />\nthe Administration for $3,000<br />\nand the Alumni Association for<br />\n$2,000. But even if we get this<br />\nmoney, we will not be able to<br />\nmeet the cost. Therefore, we feel<br />\nthat it is absolutely necessary<br />\nto increase class dues by at<br />\nleast two dollars. This would allow us a financial basis of approximately $6,000.The poll which<br />\nwas taken last week showed<br />\nthat of 545 students, 90% wanted the Week-end, but only 48%<br />\nwere willing to increase class<br />\ndues. Next week, the members<br />\nof the classes of '63. '64, and '65<br />\nare going to be asked to vote<br />\nfor or against the increase. From<br />\nthis, the Cotillion Board will be<br />\nable to tell if the students are<br />\nwilling to pay for the large<br />\nsocial event, which will include<br />\npeople such as the Limelighters<br />\nor Brubeck, and Ray Charles,<br />\nRay Coniff, or Glenn Miller.<br />\nIn seeking other ways of paying for this Week-end, I have<br />\ncontacted the president of the<br />\nstudent organizations at Goucher, Mae Mallory Spence, and<br />\nshe said that it is very possible<br />\nthat Goucher will increase their<br />\nclass dues by two dollars for<br />\nthe function \u2014 this would give<br />\nUs approximately $7,600, if our<br />\nclass dues are raised.
