Some universities,<br />\nWhich had accepted more<br />\nraduate students than they could<br />\n2ndle in order to make up for<br />\nul.e draft's toll, have been faced<br />\nvvith money and housing<br />\nshortages too many students.<br />\nt,They had failed to calculate<br />\nfall's election and its<br />\nraMifications on the draft in their<br />\nestimates last spring.<br />\nFearful of Publicity<br />\nDeans of some of the nation's<br />\nlillost prestigious graduate schools,<br />\n,<br />\nllowever, are now worried that<br />\n44<br />\n\u201e<br />\nell publicity on the lack of<br />\nel!ects on graduate enrollment<br />\nill make it difficult for them to<br />\ni\u00b0\u00b0bY for changes in the draft<br />\n'<br />\nNvs. Many hoped that the new<br />\nministration and the new<br />\n'u.ngress taking office in January<br />\nWill alleviate many of the present<br />\nProblems laced by the schools.<br />\n<br />\n\"Nobody knows whether<br />\ngraduate schools are badly hurt,\"<br />\nstated Gustave Ant, president of<br />\nthe Council of Graduate Schools<br />\nin the U.S. Arlt is urging thai<br />\nuniversities gather more<br />\ninformation about their graduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nIn February, when the<br />\nSelective Service System<br />\nannounced that graduate students<br />\nwould no longer be deferred \"in<br />\nthe national interest,\" both<br />\nuniversities and the government<br />\npredicted that schools might lose<br />\nup to 70 per cent of their<br />\nfirst-year students. They forcasted<br />\na great increase in female and<br />\nmiddle-aged graduate students.<br />\nSmall Call-Up<br />\nSelective Service officials<br />\npredicted that students would<br />\nmake up to 90 per cent of the<br />\ndraft call-ups in many states. The<br />\nDefense Department said 63 per<br />\ncent of the 240,000 draftees<br />\npredicted for 1969 would be<br />\nstudents. Students made up 3.8<br />\nper cent this year.<br />\nBut the crunch failed to<br />\nmaterialize this fall. For one<br />\nthing, draft calls beginning in July<br />\nwere drastically lower than those<br />\nfor previous months. And they<br />\nwill stay that way until January<br />\nwhen the elections are well over.<br />\n<br />\nBack in March, a lot of<br />\nunadulterated crap was written<br />\nabout a Johnson victory in the<br />\ncurrent election. In retrospect and<br />\nin the long run, it seems that that<br />\nunadulterated crap was not far<br />\nfrom wrong. While Johnson<br />\nhimself chose not to go through<br />\nthe rigors of re-assembling the old<br />\nNew Deal coalition, his chosen<br />\nsuccessor proved that the old<br />\nwobbly combination of Liberals,<br />\nlabor and the minority groups<br />\ncould be scraped together just one<br />\nmore time.<br />\nHumphrey's election will,<br />\nunfortunately, be taken by him as<br />\na reward for once again pulling<br />\nthe New Deal out of his hat. This<br />\nwill be a twofold disaster. First, it<br />\nmeans that the new<br />\nadministration will have little, if<br />\nany, impetus to re-evaluate the<br />\nmistakes of the old one. These<br />\nmistakes are not entirely foreign<br />\n(foreign affairs being an area in<br />\nwhich the New Deal tradition sets<br />\nno rules or patterns).<br />\nDomestically, it will take more<br />\nthan a continuation of present<br />\nprograms and trends to solve the<br />\nproblems that the Democrats have<br />\nbeen traditionally interested in.<br />\nSocial problems are solved by<br />\nsocial reorganization; they are not<br />\nbought off. None of Humphrey's<br />\nstatements recognized that a<br />\nchange in the quality of American<br />\nsociety would be more necessary<br />\nthan continued increases in the<br />\nexpenditure of resources.<br />\nThe second drawback in the<br />\nHumphrey election is the<br />\ncontinued rift between liberal and<br />\nradical thinkers that will remain<br />\nto impede the progress really<br />\nneeded in the '70's. Liberals,<br />\nwhen all their soul-searching is<br />\ndone, trust Humphrey, while<br />\nradicals have already learned their<br />\nlessons about giving their hearts to<br />\nany man in the White House.<br />\n<br />\npermits for the rally in Lafayette<br />\nPark and the march from the<br />\nLincoln Memorial to the Park.<br />\nMore than 1,000 people<br />\ngathered at the Lincoln Memorial<br />\nto hear Carl Oglesby, former naHow much calls will raise will tional secretary of SDS, and<br />\nHubert Humphrey uses his<br />\ndepend on the manpower needs of Michael Tilman, a Washington, State of the Union address to<br />\nthe army, the status of the D.C. high school student.<br />\nlaunch his New Day program.

Larrabee of<br />\nBiophysics, who was head of the<br />\nCommittee from its inception<br />\nseven years ago until this year,<br />\nand Dr. Carl Swanson, the present<br />\nchairman, commented recently on<br />\nthe Committee's purpose and<br />\neffectiveness.<br />\nAgreeable to All<br />\nDr. Swanson pointed out that<br />\neach Committee member,<br />\nexperienced as he is in dealing<br />\nwith the differing requirements of<br />\nvarious medical schools, is able to<br />\ngather the necessary material<br />\nquickly and efficiently, thus<br />\nsaving the pre-med student<br />\nassigned to him a great deal of<br />\ntime and trouble. The process is<br />\nalso very agreeable to the medical<br />\nschools since they receive one<br />\ncompact file containing exactly<br />\nthe data they want to see.<br />\nAs explained by Drs. Swanson<br />\nand Larrabee, the Committee<br />\nmember serves essentially as a<br />\ndata co-ordinator. He starts with<br />\nthe student's academic record. To<br />\nthis he adds a list (prepared by the<br />\nstudent) of the student's<br />\nextra-curricular activities as well<br />\nas any scholarships and prizes he<br />\nhas received. The file is then<br />\ncompleted by the addition of the<br />\nresults of a personal interview<br />\nalong with as many letters of<br />\nreference as the particular school<br />\nrequires. As soon as the file is<br />\ncomplete, the Committee<br />\nforwards it to the applicant's \u2022<br />\nmedical institution.<br />\nAs often as possible the<br />\ninterview which becomes part of<br />\nthe file is conducted by the<br />\nstudent's faculty advisor. This is<br />\nnot always true, however, and<br />\nDean Swanson noted that the<br />\nstudent has some voice in. the<br />\nchoice of his interviewer. The<br />\nDean continued that if any<br />\nconflicts develop and a change is<br />\nrequested, the interviewer will be<br />\nreassigned immediately.<br />\nThe Time is Right<br />\nInterviews are given in the fall,<br />\nusually in October. Dr. Larrabee<br />\npointed out that while there has<br />\nbeen some criticism of the<br />\nadoption of the autumn period<br />\nover the selection of a span of<br />\nsimilar duration in late spring, the<br />\nchoice was the only one which<br />\nallows the Committee to prepare<br />\nsatisfactory recommendations. To<br />\nmake up files before all the junior<br />\nyear grades were available would<br />\ngive the medical schools an<br />\nincomplete and shallow picture of<br />\nthe applicant. Although the<br />\nsummer would seem to be an ideal<br />\ntime, most professors leave the<br />\ncampus and so are not available<br />\nfor recommendation work.<br />\nThe present procedure is for<br />\nany prospective medical student<br />\nto register with the registrar's<br />\noffice in the spring. Notifications<br />\nto this effect are posted on<br />\n<br />\nbulletin boards and placed in the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nThe registrar then starts a file<br />\non each student to be turned over<br />\nto the applicant's Committee<br />\nmember in the fall. The member<br />\nthen adds any other material<br />\npersuant to the application and<br />\ngives the file to the Committee<br />\nchairman for disposition.<br />\nNo Trouble<br />\nBoth Dr. Swanson and Dr.<br />\nLarrabee agreed that not only has<br />\nthere been no trouble in getting<br />\nthe medical institutions to accept<br />\nthe recommendation-by-committee system, but that the<br />\nschools seem to prefer our<br />\nmethod to the old separate<br />\nrecommendation method.<br />\nDr. Swanson also brought up<br />\nanother effect of the committee<br />\nsystem. By keeping track of which<br />\n<br />\nstudents gain admittance to which<br />\nschools the Committee members<br />\nare able to function somewhat as<br />\nguidance counselors.<br />\nStatistics bear out the<br />\neffectiveness of the Committee's<br />\nwork. Over the past four years the<br />\nCommittee has handled the<br />\napplications of approximately 70<br />\ngraduating seniors each year. Of<br />\nthese approximately 85% were<br />\naccepted each year with the<br />\nexception of 1968 for which<br />\ncomplete figures are not yet<br />\navailable. (Although partial<br />\nreturns indicate the percentage<br />\nwill be as high as in previous<br />\nye ar ).

Obviously, his purpose is to legalize the<br />\naction which the SC took towards the Black Students Union's bid for<br />\nrecognition. Such an amendment will also prevent the BSU from ever<br />\nseeking such a stamp of approval in the future, as if the Black group<br />\nwould ever desire this. President Bruce Baker of the B.S.U. has made<br />\nit clear that his organization intends to \"ignore\" the S.C. They can<br />\neasily do their very important work without the backing of the SC<br />\nwhich failed two weeks ago to recognize the real significance and<br />\nvalue of the BSU and the need to strengthen the present state of Black<br />\nidentityin this nation, and college. The University community and<br />\nadministration has shown its great concern for the work of the BSU<br />\nby recognizing it as a part of Hopkins and pledging funds for its<br />\noperation.<br />\nThe question now standing before the Student Council should be<br />\nrejected by its members on the grounds that it prevents the SC from<br />\nmaintaining even a small degree of maneuverability. As the BSU has<br />\nproven, there are situations when a narrow interest group can<br />\naccomplish certain highly beneficial aims for the University<br />\ncommunity, which could not be obtained if membership was open to<br />\neveryone.<br />\n<br />\nThe Peace Gap<br />\nOnce again the American government is permitting the illegitimate<br />\ngovernment of South Vietnam to dictate the terms of the conflict<br />\nthere and the peace negotiations which have been taking place in<br />\nParis. This situation has gone on for too long and must be changed. It<br />\nis time that Lyndon Johnson, if he truly desires to end this war and<br />\nclear his name for the history books, realizes that those are Americans<br />\ndying by the thousands in Southeast Asia. Thieu and his corrupt<br />\ncronies have repeatedly shown a disgust for the democratic process<br />\nand for any overtures which might bring the war to an end. He knows<br />\nall too well that any settlement would toll the end of his reign over<br />\nSouth Vietnam.<br />\nHe uses the excuse that he cannot attend the peace negotiations if<br />\nthe National Liberation Front is permitted to participate. His<br />\ninsistence on not sending a representative has forced the talks to be<br />\npostponed. When they will recommence is anyone's guest. Johnson<br />\nhas been stupid enough to allow Thieu to play this insidious and<br />\nfrightening game with the lives of our own men. LBJ has tried to tell<br />\nThieu that sitting at the same table with the NLF is not the same as<br />\nrecognizing them, and that they will play a very small roll in any<br />\nfuture South Vietnam government. Even the leaders of the Thieu<br />\nregime know that acceptance of the NLF at the negotiating table is<br />\ntantamount to recognition of that group. Hopefully, peace<br />\nnegotiations with both the Saigon government and the NLF included<br />\nwill lead to the formation of some sort of coalition government. Such<br />\nas occurrence is the only way to end the war with neither side losing<br />\nface. It is impossible at this time to conduct elections which are free<br />\nfrom intimidation and corruption. Even if such an idealistic action<br />\ncould occur, the NLF or the Thieu regime would never accept the<br />\noutcome if it ran against them.<br />\nThe real problem is what to do now that Thieu has refused to<br />\ncooperate. There is only one thing that can be done. The peace<br />\nnegotiations must begin immediately with or without the government<br />\nof South Vietnam. Our government, if necessary, has to do the<br />\nnegotiating for them. Acting on this premise and the hope that an<br />\naccommodating settlement can be achieved, we must begin working to<br />\nbring immediate peace to Vietnam. If the Thieu government should<br />\nrefuse to accept the decision of the conference, then we would have<br />\nonly one alternative remaining: All American troops should be<br />\nordered removed from South Vietnam. The people who are presently<br />\nbacking Thieu are not naive enough to sit back and watch the<br />\nAmericans leave the country. Undoubtedly, they would force Theiu<br />\nto accept the Paris settlement, or get rid of Thieu.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD BALTIMORE NOVEMBER 8 1968<br />\n<br />\nBlack Blues and Cream<br />\nBy MARK REUTTER<br />\nRock music traces its roots<br />\nback to the black blues. But instead of the dirty cubbyhole bars<br />\nwhich form the lifeline of the<br />\nBlack blues masters, their white<br />\ncounterparts can pack a full house<br />\nof enthusiastic thousands.<br />\nThis was evident in the final<br />\nperformance of The Cream amid<br />\nreports that this pace-setting<br />\ngroup will not split up after all.<br />\nThe Cream's effect on progressive<br />\nrock has been substantial<br />\nespecially in the last year. Many<br />\nnovice guitarists are imitating the<br />\nClapton Sound with varying<br />\ndegrees of success. But even with<br />\nthe trio's technical and inventive<br />\nbrilliance, they are essentially an<br />\nextension, although one of great<br />\nimpact, of the rapidly evolving<br />\nnature of the American blues. At<br />\ntheir demise, blues seems now to<br />\nbe edging towards jazz through<br />\nsuch groups as the Larry Coryell<br />\nQuartet and Ten Years After.<br />\nThe sounds of the<br />\nexperimental blues headed by The<br />\nCream have grown from a long<br />\nstring of white bluesmen who in<br />\nthe early 1960's broke through<br />\nthe color barrier and raised a<br />\ns u p re sse d minority's creative<br />\noutlet to the backbone of the<br />\nrock movement. The Negro artist,<br />\ntreated by many whites as just<br />\nanother Negro in the routines of<br />\nlife, is virtually worshipped by the<br />\nwhite musicans. Eric Clapton,<br />\nconsidered to be one of the<br />\ngreatest white bluesmen, once<br />\nremarked, \"You're a blues player<br />\nonly when you are playing, but<br />\nthe Negro bluesmen live the blues<br />\nenvironment. Even hearing them<br />\ntalk is to hear the blues . . . And<br />\nrock is like a battery that must<br />\nalways go back to the blues to get<br />\nrecharged.\"<br />\nAn early breakthrough in white<br />\nblues occurred in 1962 when a<br />\ncomposite of urban blues sounds<br />\nby white artists was released<br />\n<br />\nunder ELECTRA records, labeled<br />\nThe Blues Project. The cuts<br />\ncontained the non-electrified<br />\nsounds of Danny Kalb, later of<br />\nthe influential and now defunct<br />\ngroup, the Blues Project; Dave<br />\nVon Ronk, John Koerner, Eric<br />\nVon Schmidt, and other white<br />\nbluesmen.<br />\nMain Thrust<br />\nBut the main thrust at this<br />\ntime was in the capital of the<br />\nblues - - Chicago's South Side.<br />\nHere many of the great blues<br />\nplayers, including Mundy Waters,<br />\nLittle Walters, and Chester<br />\nWalters, and Chester \"Howling<br />\nWolf\" Burnett, perfected their art<br />\nin the grimy slum buildings. Here<br />\nalso was Paul Butterfield, a white<br />\nharmonica player and vocalist.<br />\nThrough the grueling blues circuit<br />\nhe won the respect of the black<br />\nprofession and in 1962 formed<br />\nthe inter-racial Butterfield Blues<br />\nBand. Later he attracted the<br />\nyoung guitarist, Mike Bloomfield,<br />\nwho ranks with Clapton as a<br />\nmaster of the blues. British<br />\nmusicians, among them The<br />\nStones, The Animals, and John<br />\nMayall's Bluesbreakers, looked at<br />\nthe American blues in the early<br />\n60's as a powerful musical force.<br />\nAnd then one of the most<br />\nunique exports from Britain, The<br />\nCream, began broadly<br />\nre-interpreting and refining the<br />\nblues along with some of the<br />\nexperimental black musicians,<br />\nnotably Albert King. In their<br />\nfirst release, Fresh Cream, the trio<br />\ntook pieces from the old geniuses<br />\nlike Muddy Waters all the time<br />\ndeveloping their own style of<br />\nblues. Their mode of playing<br />\nbecame more apparent in their<br />\nsecond album, but it was in their<br />\nlast, Wheels of Fire, that their<br />\nvolatile blues base came distinctly<br />\ninto focus.<br />\nThe three artists continually<br />\ncompeted for musical dominance<br />\nthat night. \"We're all playing<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nagainst each other. Each melody is<br />\nlargely improvised and the object<br />\nis to get so far away from the<br />\noriginal line that you're playing<br />\nsomething that has never been<br />\nheard before,\" Jack Bruce has said.<br />\nTHE CREAM played an<br />\nintense blues at their Civic Center<br />\nperformance. Their oft-found<br />\nalbum humor was only evident in<br />\ntheir second song.<br />\n\"Come on, baby, get into my big,<br />\nblack car; I'm gonna show you<br />\njust what my politics are .. \u2022 I<br />\nsupport the left; But I'm leaning<br />\nto the right...\"<br />\nJack Bruce, to this observer,<br />\nwas the most exciting performer.<br />\nIt was obvious by his physical<br />\nmovements that he lives as well as<br />\nplays the blues. His rendition of<br />\nTRAINTIME was a showpiece of<br />\nhis superb mastery of the<br />\nharmonica. In TOAD Ginger<br />\nproved to be the victor in his 13<br />\nminute blitzkrieg on the drums.<br />\nWithin the intense beauty of<br />\nthis final night lay also the pathos<br />\nof tortured flesh. It has been<br />\nrepeatedly rumored that Ginger<br />\nBaker is dying, leaving his,<br />\ndrumming odysseys only taped<br />\nmemories. Jack Bruce and Eric<br />\nClapton are sapped of energy after<br />\nalmost two years of grueling<br />\nvirtuosity continually demanded<br />\nby their audiences. They will g\u00b0<br />\nback to relative obscurity, at least<br />\nfor awhile, to replenish their life<br />\nand music.<br />\nTo watch THE CREAM play, it<br />\nis obvious that money does not<br />\nmotivate them. They play for the<br />\npossibility of finding a new riff<br />\nwhich will better express their<br />\ninner feelings. Clapton once<br />\nexplained, \"Being together only<br />\nhappens once in awhile. We'll be<br />\nplaying along, getting something<br />\nnew and I'll look up and they'll be<br />\njust where I am, doing the same<br />\nthinv. It can go on for a half hour<br />\nand when -it happens, it's a<br />\nglimpse of what can be. Yes, what<br />\nreally can be.\"<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nVeritas<br />\n<br />\nHonor Codellopelessi<br />\nBy HOWARD KATZ<br />\nThe Honor System is a good<br />\nidea. It is therefore rather<br />\nunfortunate that it does not work.<br />\nIts lack of success is not<br />\nattributable to the members of<br />\nthe Honor Commission, most of<br />\nwhom earnestly believe in the<br />\nsystem and desire to make it<br />\nwork. (Only a small minority of<br />\nthe Commission members are<br />\nthere because Commission<br />\nmembership looks good on<br />\ngraduate school applications.)<br />\nRather, the Honor System fails to<br />\nwork because there are defects in<br />\nit serious enough to necessitate<br />\nthe entire system being re-thought<br />\nout. Minor adjustments made<br />\nfrom year to year are just not<br />\nsufficient to do the job. Such a<br />\nminor adjustment is the new<br />\npolicy of having an open Honor<br />\nCommission meeting once a<br />\nmonth to induce greater student<br />\nparticipation and interest in the<br />\nHonor System. It's a progressive<br />\nthought, but unlikely to be of<br />\nsignificant help to the system.<br />\nChange Needed<br />\nRather, the system has to be<br />\ndrastically altered for it to<br />\nfunction effectively on campus. It<br />\nwill take more than open meetings<br />\nto convince the student body that<br />\nit is \"the student's Honor<br />\nCommission.\" The Honor<br />\nCommission is now part of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity system and is perceived<br />\nas such by the students. Instead,<br />\nthe Honor Commission should<br />\nexist as an option of which the<br />\nstudent may avail himself when<br />\naccused of cheating. The student<br />\nshould have the choice of either<br />\nsubmitting to a professor's<br />\njudgment as to his dishonesty or<br />\nopting for a judgment of his<br />\npeers. Possibly the Honor<br />\nCommission might be appealed to<br />\neven after the student has chosen<br />\nthe professor's justice and been<br />\nconvicted, the Honor Commission<br />\nserving as a last court of appeal. In<br />\nthis way, the Honor Commission,<br />\nthough impartial in its<br />\njudgments\u201e would more be felt<br />\nby the students to be working in<br />\nthe best interests of the student<br />\nbody, and this feeling is a<br />\nprerequisite for student support.<br />\nCheating<br />\nAnother basic change in the<br />\nfunction of the Honor<br />\nCommission is necessary.<br />\nCheating, while not rampant on<br />\ncampus, is certainly widespread.<br />\nYet, few cases are reported<br />\ncompared to the .amount of<br />\ncheating going on.

What is bothersome is that<br />\na large number of high marks<br />\ngotten by \"unfair academic<br />\nadvantage\" pushes the honest<br />\nstudent's low B into a C+ on the<br />\nclass curve.<br />\nTo help prevent this from<br />\nhappening, the Honor<br />\nCommission ought to allow a<br />\nstudent to report a course or a<br />\nprofessor for allowing cheating,<br />\neither due to his negligence or the<br />\nway he has structured his course.<br />\nThe Honor Commission would<br />\nthen investigate and if<br />\nappropriate, speak with the<br />\nprofessor about the problem. If<br />\nthe professor refuses to change,<br />\nthen the Honor Commission<br />\nshould publish in the Course<br />\nGuide, or in its own publication, a<br />\nlist of the \"cheating courses\" so<br />\nthat (a) the cheaters can compete<br />\nagainst each other and no one else<br />\nwill be hurt, and (b) if the honest<br />\nstudent still wishes to take the<br />\ncourse, at least he will know what<br />\nhe is going to be up against.

As far as the<br />\nfund is concerned, the federal funds can be ignored;federal money is<br />\nrarely allocated for capital purposes, and are always restrictive.<br />\nFurthermore, the Fund cannot, of course, solicit federal funds as the<br />\ngovernment decides upon its allocation.<br />\nThe private sector itself contains four separate sources of money:<br />\n1) wealthy non-alumni, 2) foundations, 3) alumni, and 4)<br />\ncorporations, whose financial support is sought by both professional<br />\nand volunteer money-raisers. The University cannot, however, use the<br />\nincome derived from these sources with any autonomy. Except for<br />\ngifts from alumni, the funds are usually restrictive\u2014invariably so if<br />\nthey are from foundation or corporations.<br />\nIn the period 1958-1967, foundations contributed approximately<br />\nhalf of all the funds received from the private sector, with the wealthy<br />\nnon-alumni contributions second with 28%. The high figure for<br />\nfoundations is the result of Hopkins rather privileged position among<br />\nfoundations because of its high academic standing, and also because<br />\nthe period was one of extreme generosity on the part of the Ford<br />\nFoundation.<br />\nYear-round Drives<br />\nWhile fund raising is a year-round job, the University from time to<br />\ntime undertakes major capital fund campaigns. The next drive, slated<br />\nfor 1969-1973, is being conducted to raise money for, among other<br />\nthings, the construction of an administrative building next to Levering<br />\nHall. Wealthy non-alumni are expected to contribute nearly half of<br />\nthe money for this drive, Dr. Burns stated.<br />\nIncome from the drive will, of course, be distributed among all of<br />\nthe Hopkins facilities, and will not be solely for construction on the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nThe need for capital expansion is such that one financial drive Will<br />\nin the future be immediately followed by another. The Hopkins fund<br />\nplanners expect that a three year campaign will follow the 1969-73<br />\ndrive.<br />\nTuition and Fund Raising<br />\nWhen asked what the relation was between rising tuition and<br />\ncapital fund raising, Burns said that they had little relation to each<br />\nother, as capital funds are entirely separate from the university s<br />\noperating budget. If the fund were ten times as successful as it is,<br />\nBurns continued, there would be no tuition rise; however, in general<br />\nany excess money (that over and above the target sum set by the<br />\ncampaign) would be spent in the capital area\u2014perhaps in the area of<br />\nendowment to hold down tuition.<br />\n.<br />\nr<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nEN tow gm mom Nom .1<br />\nII College Relations Director<br />\nI c/o Sheraton-Park Hotel, Washington, D.C. 20008<br />\n<br />\nPERFORMANCE<br />\nFrequency Response:<br />\n20 20,000 c p s , flat from<br />\n30 to 15,000 c PS \u2022 3db.<br />\nMaximum Input Power:<br />\n2 watts each phone<br />\nMaximum Acoustical Output:<br />\n138db s p I<br />\nImpedance:<br />\n8 ohms each phone<br />\nAttenuation of Ambient Noise:<br />\n40db at 1000 c.o.s.<br />\n<br />\nHarmonic Distortion:<br />\nDriven at 1 volt\u2022<br />\n50 cycles 1.7 %<br />\n200 cycles .35%<br />\n500 cycles .76%<br />\n1000 cycles .86%<br />\nSensitivity:<br />\n115 db re 0 0002 dyne CM\u00b0<br />\nat 1 volt input.<br />\nLateral Pressure:<br />\nApproximately 2 lbs.<br />\nover an area of<br />\n10 square inches<br />\n<br />\nMATERIAL<br />\nEar cups: Plastic high impact \"Cycolac.\" Shock and shatterproof.<br />\nEar seals: Vinyl.

James Jacobs, a<br />\nsenior, and Dean Rudoy, a sophomore, are permanent members of this<br />\ncommittee and Larry Campbell also sat in as the representative of the<br />\nCourse Guide.<br />\nRudoy explained that the Committee on Undergraduate Studies is<br />\nattempting to provide more opportunities for students to help<br />\ncjetermine the structure of undergraduate education at Hopkins. The<br />\nCommittee is setting up study groups in each of the five academic<br />\nareas: engineering studies, quantitative studies, natural sciences,<br />\numanistic studies, and social and behavioral sciences. Each group will<br />\nave a membership of one professor and one undergraduate from each<br />\nepartment in its area and will study proposals on course offerings,<br />\n1.nterdepartmental courses and majors, departmental coordination,<br />\nclepartment goals, quality for instructions and requirements for<br />\nmajors. The study groups will also consider the need for informal<br />\nseminars and noncredit courses.<br />\nIn the future, the Committees on Undergraduate Studies will<br />\nreview the recommendations from these study groups as part of its<br />\nregular agenda. The Committee will also discuss the problems of the<br />\narop date, calendar reform, and Hopkins-Goucher course exchange.<br />\nGeorge Kirschbaum, student representative to the Traffic and<br />\nForking Committee, reported that the committee has met several<br />\ntimes this semester but has yet to find a way to solVe the serious<br />\nParking problems on campus.<br />\nAn ad hoc committee to review the Athletic Department has had<br />\n.5\u00b0111e preliminary meetings but has not begun any substantive<br />\ninvestigation. Paul Allen, a junior, and Dennis Estis, a senior, are both<br />\nPermanent members of this group.<br />\nAlthough these examples demonstrate that student participation<br />\nOn faculty committees can give the undergraduates Some voice in<br />\nPolicy-making, there are still several major problems with this type of<br />\napproach. For example, several important groups have had no<br />\nMeetings so far. The Committees on Student Affiars, the Bookstore,<br />\nthe Library, and Admissions and Financial Aid have not met this<br />\nsemester although all of them have student representatives and each of<br />\nthem affects important areas of student life.<br />\nThere is still no student voice on the Academic Council, the most<br />\nimportant policy-making forum at Homewood.

The $150 million invested in the Games<br />\nwas profitably used to construct the most magnificient complex of<br />\nathletic facilities anywhere in the world. The immense problems of<br />\narranging an event of such proportions in a country ripe with political<br />\nstrife and student unrest must not be overlooked.<br />\nToo loud was the voice of those pessimists who added to the near<br />\nschizophrenic air by predicting a disruption of the XIX Olympics<br />\nbecause of \"insurmountable hurdles.\" The rarefied air of the<br />\n'7,349-foot high Mexican capital, the battles between students and<br />\ntroops, the South African question, the threats of boycott by Negro<br />\nAmericans, and the Russian-Czechoslovakia tension\u2014at least one<br />\nwould cause an early end to the Games, if indeed they could be held<br />\nat all.<br />\nScarcity of oxygen, heat, and Mexican food drew complaints from<br />\nall sides, but the quality of performances and number of world<br />\nrecords broken served to demonstrate their relative insignificance. The<br />\nshooting of thirty-four students on October 10 has been termed<br />\nunnecessary, and undoubtedly it was. The Olympic Games cannot be<br />\nheld responsible for their deaths. Brutality of such a nature has not<br />\nbeen uncommon to our neighbor in the south.<br />\nThe questions raised by Carlos and Smith, South Africans, and the<br />\nCzech demonstration of hatred for Russia have raised as much<br />\npublicity as the unbelievable performance of several athletes. It is<br />\nright that they should, and hypocritical to maintain that the situation<br />\ncould be otherwise. Pragmatically speaking, there is no better place to<br />\ndemonstrate political or social dissent. Avery Brundage has served<br />\nwell, but in this one area he is the victim of severe misjudgement.<br />\nThere shall never be another Olympiad devoid of political overtones.<br />\nHow can there be, when all of the emphasis is on nation vs. nation and<br />\nnot on athlete against athlete? How often has it been boasted, \"We<br />\nwon 45 gold medals, and the Russians got only 29?\" How can<br />\nAmerican Negroes be expected to calmly represent a country which<br />\nthey feel does not respect them as citizens? Similarly, illegal<br />\nmedicines, dope tests, and rumors of scandal and payoffs will remain<br />\npermanent elements of the Olympics.<br />\nPerhaps the most rewarding outcome of the XIX Olympiad, at least<br />\nfrom the American outlook, was the outstanding performances of<br />\nU.S. athletes. Victories exceeded expectations in almost every<br />\nevent\u2014certainly in track and field, basketball, and swimming (where<br />\nthe most one-sided Olympic meet ever occurred.) A few names suffice<br />\nto demonstrate the United States superiority\u2014Jim Hines, Tommie<br />\nSmith, Al Oerter Bill Toomey, Bob Beamon, Bob Seagren, Randy<br />\nMatson, Wyomia Tyus, and Dick Fosbury in track and field; Debbie<br />\nMeyer, Mike Burton, Charlie Hickcox, and Doug Russell in swimming;<br />\nGeorge Foreman in boxing; Bill Steinkraus in grand prix jumping; and<br />\nGary Anderson in free rifle shooting. The list continues, seemingly<br />\nwithout end.<br />\nAlso notable were our team performances. Basketball, predicted to<br />\nbe the most embarrassing event for the U.S., proved to be a highlight<br />\nof the Games. Coach Hank lba was determined to preserve an<br />\nunblemished record, and his charges did so handsomely. The absence<br />\nof such personages as Alcindor, Hayes, and Unseld made the victory<br />\neven more spectacular. Russia and Yugoslavia had best content<br />\nthemselves with trying for the silver in the future.<br />\nThe victories of American women competitors deserve note. Their<br />\nendeavors were much improved over those in Tokyo in<br />\n1964-especially in swimming.<br />\nOne final observation on the Mexican Games\u2014the competition has<br />\nbecome so intense that it would appear to place an age restriction on<br />\nmost events. The average age on an Olympiac looks to be declining.<br />\nFantastically improved performances last month came predominately<br />\nfrom the furor of the contests. Said Billy Toomey, California school<br />\nteacher and outstanding gold medal winner in the decathlon, \"I've<br />\nnever had to endure anything.so intense.

The passing<br />\nand rushing attacks were<br />\noutstanding; the defensive line<br />\nwas strong; and the secondary<br />\npicked off seven \"Mellon\" passes.<br />\nThe score wasn't lopsided only<br />\nbecause Lance Squires, the<br />\nCarnegie quarterback, didn't care<br />\nhow many of his passes were<br />\nintercepted.<br />\nHe threw 51 passes and<br />\ncompleted 25 of them to his<br />\nreceivers. Squires tossed five<br />\ntouchdown passes and rang up<br />\n402 yards through the air. After<br />\nhaving been trampled the week<br />\nbefore by Randolph Macon's<br />\nHoward Stevens, the Jays found<br />\nthe Carnegie Mellon offense an<br />\ninteresting contrast.<br />\nCowan and Weiss Star<br />\nThe Mellon defense, however,<br />\nwas much less of a hassle. Joe<br />\nCowan and Paul Weiss stepped<br />\n<br />\nthrough gaping holes in the<br />\nMellon line and between them<br />\ngained 350 yards. Jim Feely threw<br />\nwith prudence and completed<br />\nbetter than 50% of his passes. His<br />\nsingle mistake, however, provided<br />\na dramatic lift for the opposition<br />\nat a time when the Jays were<br />\nabout to administer a knockout<br />\nblow.<br />\nHopkins held a 27-12 halftime<br />\nlead and proceeded to take the<br />\nsecond half kickoff in for a score,<br />\na drive culminating in a six yard<br />\nrun by Paul Weiss. They were<br />\nmarching minutes later for<br />\nperhaps the clinching score when<br />\nReggin Cherray intercepted a<br />\nFeely pass in the Carnegie end<br />\nzone and returned it 102 yards for<br />\na touchdown; Hopkin's lead was<br />\nsliced to 33-18. Then Squires<br />\nthrew another scoring pass and<br />\nthe score now stood at 33-26.<br />\nBut Joe Cowan had yet to<br />\nmake his full presence felt. Paul<br />\nWeiss had been the workhorse of<br />\nthe first half, registering two,<br />\ntouchdowns, one on a short<br />\nplunge and the other on a 42<br />\nyard Feely pass. In the second<br />\nhalf, Cowan took over. He raced<br />\n42 yards for a Hopkins'<br />\ntouchdown to advance the score<br />\nto 41-26; when the Jays got the<br />\n<br />\nBaby Jays First Win<br />\nSaves Losing Record<br />\nBY MIKE SHORE<br />\nThe frosh football team<br />\nbecame winners for the first time<br />\nthis season, when they defeated<br />\nthe Susquehanna Junior Varsity<br />\nby a score of 16-6, at<br />\nSusquehanna.<br />\nSusquehanna came into the<br />\ngame with a very respectable 2-1<br />\nrecord, including victories over<br />\nWestern Maryland and Lycoming,<br />\nand their only loss to Stevens<br />\nTech. This was opposed to our<br />\nsquad's mediocre 0-1 record after<br />\nlast week's loss to F&M.<br />\nThe game started off on a<br />\ndisappointing note when<br />\nSusquehanna took the opening<br />\nkick-off and moved downfield like<br />\na juggernaut to the Hopkins six<br />\nfor a first down. Then the<br />\nHopkins defense showed the stuff<br />\nof which football players are<br />\nmade. After four successive<br />\nrunning plays failed to score, the<br />\nfrosh took over on the one foot<br />\nline. From then on the game was<br />\nunder our control.<br />\nAfter moving to two first<br />\ndowns, the offense sputtered; and<br />\nafter an exchange of punts our<br />\nmen got the ball on their own 25<br />\nyard line. They embarked on a<br />\nmarvelously executed drive which<br />\nled to a score. The drive was<br />\nhighlighted by two Bud Whalen to<br />\nDave Pickall passed for 27 and 21<br />\nyards respectively.<br />\nLet the Tough Get Going<br />\nThe drive was brought to a<br />\nsuccessful conclusion by Steve<br />\nUtz's 5 yard plunge for the first of<br />\nhis two touchdowns. The two<br />\npoints after touchdown were<br />\nmade by a Pickall to Kevin<br />\nKripatis pass and the score was<br />\n8-0.<br />\nThe next scoring came midway<br />\ninto the second quarter when<br />\nprodigious Hopkins guard Mike<br />\n<br />\nGross barrelled through the<br />\nSusquehanna line to block a punt<br />\nand turn it into a 2 point safety.<br />\nThis coup de grace gave the boys a<br />\n10-0 lead at halftime.<br />\nIn the third quarter<br />\nSusquehanna came back to score a<br />\ntouchdown, but they failed to get<br />\nthe extra point. The 10-6 score at<br />\nthis point was as close as they<br />\ncame for the duration.<br />\nHowever, the game's quota of<br />\nexcitement was not yet<br />\nexhausted. Towards the end of<br />\nthe fourth quarter Susquehanna<br />\nbegan to act as if they were going<br />\nto score again. They reached the<br />\nHopkins 30, but the defense once<br />\nagain handled them. Led by Bud<br />\nCleveland, they threw the QB for<br />\nseveral losses and forced him to<br />\nthrow the ball to an ineligible<br />\nreceiver for a penalty.<br />\nAfter another exchange of<br />\npunts, once again Steve Utz<br />\nscored\u2014this time with only 30<br />\nseconds left, bringing his yardage<br />\ntotal to 91 on 38 carries. This<br />\ncompleted the scoring for the<br />\ngame.<br />\nVarsity Potential<br />\nCoach Scott had a long list of<br />\nmembers of the squad who<br />\ndeserved special credit, including<br />\nthe entire defensive line, end Eric<br />\nBergofsky, tackle Howard Weaver,<br />\nand guard Mark Curtis.

For one<br />\nthing, draft calls beginning in July<br />\nwere drastically lower than those<br />\nfor previous months. And they<br />\nwill stay that way until January<br />\nwhen the elections are well over.<br /><br />\nBack in March, a lot of<br />\nunadulterated crap was written<br />\nabout a Johnson victory in the<br />\ncurrent election. In retrospect and<br />\nin the long run, it seems that that<br />\nunadulterated crap was not far<br />\nfrom wrong. While Johnson<br />\nhimself chose not to go through<br />\nthe rigors of re-assembling the old<br />\nNew Deal coalition, his chosen<br />\nsuccessor proved that the old<br />\nwobbly combination of Liberals,<br />\nlabor and the minority groups<br />\ncould be scraped together just one<br />\nmore time.<br />\nHumphrey's election will,<br />\nunfortunately, be taken by him as<br />\na reward for once again pulling<br />\nthe New Deal out of his hat. This<br />\nwill be a twofold disaster. First, it<br />\nmeans that the new<br />\nadministration will have little, if<br />\nany, impetus to re-evaluate the<br />\nmistakes of the old one. These<br />\nmistakes are not entirely foreign<br />\n(foreign affairs being an area in<br />\nwhich the New Deal tradition sets<br />\nno rules or patterns).<br />\nDomestically, it will take more<br />\nthan a continuation of present<br />\nprograms and trends to solve the<br />\nproblems that the Democrats have<br />\nbeen traditionally interested in.<br />\nSocial problems are solved by<br />\nsocial reorganization; they are not<br />\nbought off. None of Humphrey's<br />\nstatements recognized that a<br />\nchange in the quality of American<br />\nsociety would be more necessary<br />\nthan continued increases in the<br />\nexpenditure of resources.<br />\nThe second drawback in the<br />\nHumphrey election is the<br />\ncontinued rift between liberal and<br />\nradical thinkers that will remain<br />\nto impede the progress really<br />\nneeded in the '70's. Liberals,<br />\nwhen all their soul-searching is<br />\ndone, trust Humphrey, while<br />\nradicals have already learned their<br />\nlessons about giving their hearts to<br />\nany man in the White House.<br /><br />\npermits for the rally in Lafayette<br />\nPark and the march from the<br />\nLincoln Memorial to the Park.<br />\nMore than 1,000 people<br />\ngathered at the Lincoln Memorial<br />\nto hear Carl Oglesby, former naHow much calls will raise will tional secretary of SDS, and<br />\nHubert Humphrey uses his<br />\ndepend on the manpower needs of Michael Tilman, a Washington, State of the Union address to<br />\nthe army, the status of the D.C. high school student.<br />\nlaunch his New Day program.

Larrabee of<br />\nBiophysics, who was head of the<br />\nCommittee from its inception<br />\nseven years ago until this year,<br />\nand Dr. Carl Swanson, the present<br />\nchairman, commented recently on<br />\nthe Committee's purpose and<br />\neffectiveness.<br />\nAgreeable to All<br />\nDr. Swanson pointed out that<br />\neach Committee member,<br />\nexperienced as he is in dealing<br />\nwith the differing requirements of<br />\nvarious medical schools, is able to<br />\ngather the necessary material<br />\nquickly and efficiently, thus<br />\nsaving the pre-med student<br />\nassigned to him a great deal of<br />\ntime and trouble. The process is<br />\nalso very agreeable to the medical<br />\nschools since they receive one<br />\ncompact file containing exactly<br />\nthe data they want to see.<br />\nAs explained by Drs. Swanson<br />\nand Larrabee, the Committee<br />\nmember serves essentially as a<br />\ndata co-ordinator. He starts with<br />\nthe student's academic record. To<br />\nthis he adds a list (prepared by the<br />\nstudent) of the student's<br />\nextra-curricular activities as well<br />\nas any scholarships and prizes he<br />\nhas received. The file is then<br />\ncompleted by the addition of the<br />\nresults of a personal interview<br />\nalong with as many letters of<br />\nreference as the particular school<br />\nrequires. As soon as the file is<br />\ncomplete, the Committee<br />\nforwards it to the applicant's \u2022<br />\nmedical institution.<br />\nAs often as possible the<br />\ninterview which becomes part of<br />\nthe file is conducted by the<br />\nstudent's faculty advisor. This is<br />\nnot always true, however, and<br />\nDean Swanson noted that the<br />\nstudent has some voice in. the<br />\nchoice of his interviewer. The<br />\nDean continued that if any<br />\nconflicts develop and a change is<br />\nrequested, the interviewer will be<br />\nreassigned immediately.<br />\nThe Time is Right<br />\nInterviews are given in the fall,<br />\nusually in October. Dr. Larrabee<br />\npointed out that while there has<br />\nbeen some criticism of the<br />\nadoption of the autumn period<br />\nover the selection of a span of<br />\nsimilar duration in late spring, the<br />\nchoice was the only one which<br />\nallows the Committee to prepare<br />\nsatisfactory recommendations. To<br />\nmake up files before all the junior<br />\nyear grades were available would<br />\ngive the medical schools an<br />\nincomplete and shallow picture of<br />\nthe applicant. Although the<br />\nsummer would seem to be an ideal<br />\ntime, most professors leave the<br />\ncampus and so are not available<br />\nfor recommendation work.<br />\nThe present procedure is for<br />\nany prospective medical student<br />\nto register with the registrar's<br />\noffice in the spring. Notifications<br />\nto this effect are posted on<br /><br />\nbulletin boards and placed in the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nThe registrar then starts a file<br />\non each student to be turned over<br />\nto the applicant's Committee<br />\nmember in the fall. The member<br />\nthen adds any other material<br />\npersuant to the application and<br />\ngives the file to the Committee<br />\nchairman for disposition.<br />\nNo Trouble<br />\nBoth Dr. Swanson and Dr.<br />\nLarrabee agreed that not only has<br />\nthere been no trouble in getting<br />\nthe medical institutions to accept<br />\nthe recommendation-by-committee system, but that the<br />\nschools seem to prefer our<br />\nmethod to the old separate<br />\nrecommendation method.<br />\nDr. Swanson also brought up<br />\nanother effect of the committee<br />\nsystem. By keeping track of which<br /><br />\nstudents gain admittance to which<br />\nschools the Committee members<br />\nare able to function somewhat as<br />\nguidance counselors.<br />\nStatistics bear out the<br />\neffectiveness of the Committee's<br />\nwork. Over the past four years the<br />\nCommittee has handled the<br />\napplications of approximately 70<br />\ngraduating seniors each year. Of<br />\nthese approximately 85% were<br />\naccepted each year with the<br />\nexception of 1968 for which<br />\ncomplete figures are not yet<br />\navailable. (Although partial<br />\nreturns indicate the percentage<br />\nwill be as high as in previous<br />\nye ar ).

Obviously, his purpose is to legalize the<br />\naction which the SC took towards the Black Students Union's bid for<br />\nrecognition. Such an amendment will also prevent the BSU from ever<br />\nseeking such a stamp of approval in the future, as if the Black group<br />\nwould ever desire this. President Bruce Baker of the B.S.U. has made<br />\nit clear that his organization intends to \"ignore\" the S.C. They can<br />\neasily do their very important work without the backing of the SC<br />\nwhich failed two weeks ago to recognize the real significance and<br />\nvalue of the BSU and the need to strengthen the present state of Black<br />\nidentityin this nation, and college. The University community and<br />\nadministration has shown its great concern for the work of the BSU<br />\nby recognizing it as a part of Hopkins and pledging funds for its<br />\noperation.<br />\nThe question now standing before the Student Council should be<br />\nrejected by its members on the grounds that it prevents the SC from<br />\nmaintaining even a small degree of maneuverability. As the BSU has<br />\nproven, there are situations when a narrow interest group can<br />\naccomplish certain highly beneficial aims for the University<br />\ncommunity, which could not be obtained if membership was open to<br />\neveryone.<br /><br />\nThe Peace Gap<br />\nOnce again the American government is permitting the illegitimate<br />\ngovernment of South Vietnam to dictate the terms of the conflict<br />\nthere and the peace negotiations which have been taking place in<br />\nParis. This situation has gone on for too long and must be changed. It<br />\nis time that Lyndon Johnson, if he truly desires to end this war and<br />\nclear his name for the history books, realizes that those are Americans<br />\ndying by the thousands in Southeast Asia. Thieu and his corrupt<br />\ncronies have repeatedly shown a disgust for the democratic process<br />\nand for any overtures which might bring the war to an end. He knows<br />\nall too well that any settlement would toll the end of his reign over<br />\nSouth Vietnam.<br />\nHe uses the excuse that he cannot attend the peace negotiations if<br />\nthe National Liberation Front is permitted to participate. His<br />\ninsistence on not sending a representative has forced the talks to be<br />\npostponed. When they will recommence is anyone's guest. Johnson<br />\nhas been stupid enough to allow Thieu to play this insidious and<br />\nfrightening game with the lives of our own men. LBJ has tried to tell<br />\nThieu that sitting at the same table with the NLF is not the same as<br />\nrecognizing them, and that they will play a very small roll in any<br />\nfuture South Vietnam government. Even the leaders of the Thieu<br />\nregime know that acceptance of the NLF at the negotiating table is<br />\ntantamount to recognition of that group. Hopefully, peace<br />\nnegotiations with both the Saigon government and the NLF included<br />\nwill lead to the formation of some sort of coalition government. Such<br />\nas occurrence is the only way to end the war with neither side losing<br />\nface. It is impossible at this time to conduct elections which are free<br />\nfrom intimidation and corruption. Even if such an idealistic action<br />\ncould occur, the NLF or the Thieu regime would never accept the<br />\noutcome if it ran against them.<br />\nThe real problem is what to do now that Thieu has refused to<br />\ncooperate. There is only one thing that can be done. The peace<br />\nnegotiations must begin immediately with or without the government<br />\nof South Vietnam. Our government, if necessary, has to do the<br />\nnegotiating for them. Acting on this premise and the hope that an<br />\naccommodating settlement can be achieved, we must begin working to<br />\nbring immediate peace to Vietnam. If the Thieu government should<br />\nrefuse to accept the decision of the conference, then we would have<br />\nonly one alternative remaining: All American troops should be<br />\nordered removed from South Vietnam. The people who are presently<br />\nbacking Thieu are not naive enough to sit back and watch the<br />\nAmericans leave the country. Undoubtedly, they would force Theiu<br />\nto accept the Paris settlement, or get rid of Thieu.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD BALTIMORE NOVEMBER 8 1968<br /><br />\nBlack Blues and Cream<br />\nBy MARK REUTTER<br />\nRock music traces its roots<br />\nback to the black blues. But instead of the dirty cubbyhole bars<br />\nwhich form the lifeline of the<br />\nBlack blues masters, their white<br />\ncounterparts can pack a full house<br />\nof enthusiastic thousands.<br />\nThis was evident in the final<br />\nperformance of The Cream amid<br />\nreports that this pace-setting<br />\ngroup will not split up after all.<br />\nThe Cream's effect on progressive<br />\nrock has been substantial<br />\nespecially in the last year. Many<br />\nnovice guitarists are imitating the<br />\nClapton Sound with varying<br />\ndegrees of success. But even with<br />\nthe trio's technical and inventive<br />\nbrilliance, they are essentially an<br />\nextension, although one of great<br />\nimpact, of the rapidly evolving<br />\nnature of the American blues. At<br />\ntheir demise, blues seems now to<br />\nbe edging towards jazz through<br />\nsuch groups as the Larry Coryell<br />\nQuartet and Ten Years After.<br />\nThe sounds of the<br />\nexperimental blues headed by The<br />\nCream have grown from a long<br />\nstring of white bluesmen who in<br />\nthe early 1960's broke through<br />\nthe color barrier and raised a<br />\ns u p re sse d minority's creative<br />\noutlet to the backbone of the<br />\nrock movement. The Negro artist,<br />\ntreated by many whites as just<br />\nanother Negro in the routines of<br />\nlife, is virtually worshipped by the<br />\nwhite musicans. Eric Clapton,<br />\nconsidered to be one of the<br />\ngreatest white bluesmen, once<br />\nremarked, \"You're a blues player<br />\nonly when you are playing, but<br />\nthe Negro bluesmen live the blues<br />\nenvironment. Even hearing them<br />\ntalk is to hear the blues . . . And<br />\nrock is like a battery that must<br />\nalways go back to the blues to get<br />\nrecharged.\"<br />\nAn early breakthrough in white<br />\nblues occurred in 1962 when a<br />\ncomposite of urban blues sounds<br />\nby white artists was released<br /><br />\nunder ELECTRA records, labeled<br />\nThe Blues Project. The cuts<br />\ncontained the non-electrified<br />\nsounds of Danny Kalb, later of<br />\nthe influential and now defunct<br />\ngroup, the Blues Project; Dave<br />\nVon Ronk, John Koerner, Eric<br />\nVon Schmidt, and other white<br />\nbluesmen.<br />\nMain Thrust<br />\nBut the main thrust at this<br />\ntime was in the capital of the<br />\nblues - - Chicago's South Side.<br />\nHere many of the great blues<br />\nplayers, including Mundy Waters,<br />\nLittle Walters, and Chester<br />\nWalters, and Chester \"Howling<br />\nWolf\" Burnett, perfected their art<br />\nin the grimy slum buildings. Here<br />\nalso was Paul Butterfield, a white<br />\nharmonica player and vocalist.<br />\nThrough the grueling blues circuit<br />\nhe won the respect of the black<br />\nprofession and in 1962 formed<br />\nthe inter-racial Butterfield Blues<br />\nBand. Later he attracted the<br />\nyoung guitarist, Mike Bloomfield,<br />\nwho ranks with Clapton as a<br />\nmaster of the blues. British<br />\nmusicians, among them The<br />\nStones, The Animals, and John<br />\nMayall's Bluesbreakers, looked at<br />\nthe American blues in the early<br />\n60's as a powerful musical force.<br />\nAnd then one of the most<br />\nunique exports from Britain, The<br />\nCream, began broadly<br />\nre-interpreting and refining the<br />\nblues along with some of the<br />\nexperimental black musicians,<br />\nnotably Albert King. In their<br />\nfirst release, Fresh Cream, the trio<br />\ntook pieces from the old geniuses<br />\nlike Muddy Waters all the time<br />\ndeveloping their own style of<br />\nblues. Their mode of playing<br />\nbecame more apparent in their<br />\nsecond album, but it was in their<br />\nlast, Wheels of Fire, that their<br />\nvolatile blues base came distinctly<br />\ninto focus.<br />\nThe three artists continually<br />\ncompeted for musical dominance<br />\nthat night. \"We're all playing<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nagainst each other. Each melody is<br />\nlargely improvised and the object<br />\nis to get so far away from the<br />\noriginal line that you're playing<br />\nsomething that has never been<br />\nheard before,\" Jack Bruce has said.<br />\nTHE CREAM played an<br />\nintense blues at their Civic Center<br />\nperformance. Their oft-found<br />\nalbum humor was only evident in<br />\ntheir second song.<br />\n\"Come on, baby, get into my big,<br />\nblack car; I'm gonna show you<br />\njust what my politics are .. \u2022 I<br />\nsupport the left; But I'm leaning<br />\nto the right...\"<br />\nJack Bruce, to this observer,<br />\nwas the most exciting performer.<br />\nIt was obvious by his physical<br />\nmovements that he lives as well as<br />\nplays the blues. His rendition of<br />\nTRAINTIME was a showpiece of<br />\nhis superb mastery of the<br />\nharmonica. In TOAD Ginger<br />\nproved to be the victor in his 13<br />\nminute blitzkrieg on the drums.<br />\nWithin the intense beauty of<br />\nthis final night lay also the pathos<br />\nof tortured flesh. It has been<br />\nrepeatedly rumored that Ginger<br />\nBaker is dying, leaving his,<br />\ndrumming odysseys only taped<br />\nmemories. Jack Bruce and Eric<br />\nClapton are sapped of energy after<br />\nalmost two years of grueling<br />\nvirtuosity continually demanded<br />\nby their audiences. They will g\u00b0<br />\nback to relative obscurity, at least<br />\nfor awhile, to replenish their life<br />\nand music.<br />\nTo watch THE CREAM play, it<br />\nis obvious that money does not<br />\nmotivate them. They play for the<br />\npossibility of finding a new riff<br />\nwhich will better express their<br />\ninner feelings. Clapton once<br />\nexplained, \"Being together only<br />\nhappens once in awhile. We'll be<br />\nplaying along, getting something<br />\nnew and I'll look up and they'll be<br />\njust where I am, doing the same<br />\nthinv. It can go on for a half hour<br />\nand when -it happens, it's a<br />\nglimpse of what can be. Yes, what<br />\nreally can be.\"<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nVeritas<br /><br />\nHonor Codellopelessi<br />\nBy HOWARD KATZ<br />\nThe Honor System is a good<br />\nidea. It is therefore rather<br />\nunfortunate that it does not work.<br />\nIts lack of success is not<br />\nattributable to the members of<br />\nthe Honor Commission, most of<br />\nwhom earnestly believe in the<br />\nsystem and desire to make it<br />\nwork. (Only a small minority of<br />\nthe Commission members are<br />\nthere because Commission<br />\nmembership looks good on<br />\ngraduate school applications.)<br />\nRather, the Honor System fails to<br />\nwork because there are defects in<br />\nit serious enough to necessitate<br />\nthe entire system being re-thought<br />\nout. Minor adjustments made<br />\nfrom year to year are just not<br />\nsufficient to do the job. Such a<br />\nminor adjustment is the new<br />\npolicy of having an open Honor<br />\nCommission meeting once a<br />\nmonth to induce greater student<br />\nparticipation and interest in the<br />\nHonor System. It's a progressive<br />\nthought, but unlikely to be of<br />\nsignificant help to the system.<br />\nChange Needed<br />\nRather, the system has to be<br />\ndrastically altered for it to<br />\nfunction effectively on campus. It<br />\nwill take more than open meetings<br />\nto convince the student body that<br />\nit is \"the student's Honor<br />\nCommission.\" The Honor<br />\nCommission is now part of the<br /><br />\nUniversity system and is perceived<br />\nas such by the students. Instead,<br />\nthe Honor Commission should<br />\nexist as an option of which the<br />\nstudent may avail himself when<br />\naccused of cheating. The student<br />\nshould have the choice of either<br />\nsubmitting to a professor's<br />\njudgment as to his dishonesty or<br />\nopting for a judgment of his<br />\npeers. Possibly the Honor<br />\nCommission might be appealed to<br />\neven after the student has chosen<br />\nthe professor's justice and been<br />\nconvicted, the Honor Commission<br />\nserving as a last court of appeal. In<br />\nthis way, the Honor Commission,<br />\nthough impartial in its<br />\njudgments\u201e would more be felt<br />\nby the students to be working in<br />\nthe best interests of the student<br />\nbody, and this feeling is a<br />\nprerequisite for student support.<br />\nCheating<br />\nAnother basic change in the<br />\nfunction of the Honor<br />\nCommission is necessary.<br />\nCheating, while not rampant on<br />\ncampus, is certainly widespread.<br />\nYet, few cases are reported<br />\ncompared to the .amount of<br />\ncheating going on. The problem<br />\nseems to arise out of the students<br />\nnot wanting to judge their peers<br />\nor, alternatively, just refusing to<br />\nscrew them out of distaste for<br />\n\"tattle-taling\" or from a fear of<br />\nretaliation of some sort. The<br />\nHonor Commission recognized<br /><br />\nthis last year when it declared it<br />\nwas not an Honor violation not to<br />\nturn in someone who cheated,<br />\nmaking honest men of us all.<br />\nMost students do not<br />\npassionately begrudge all<br />\noccasional cheater his higher<br />\nmark. What is bothersome is that<br />\na large number of high marks<br />\ngotten by \"unfair academic<br />\nadvantage\" pushes the honest<br />\nstudent's low B into a C+ on the<br />\nclass curve.<br />\nTo help prevent this from<br />\nhappening, the Honor<br />\nCommission ought to allow a<br />\nstudent to report a course or a<br />\nprofessor for allowing cheating,<br />\neither due to his negligence or the<br />\nway he has structured his course.<br />\nThe Honor Commission would<br />\nthen investigate and if<br />\nappropriate, speak with the<br />\nprofessor about the problem. If<br />\nthe professor refuses to change,<br />\nthen the Honor Commission<br />\nshould publish in the Course<br />\nGuide, or in its own publication, a<br />\nlist of the \"cheating courses\" so<br />\nthat (a) the cheaters can compete<br />\nagainst each other and no one else<br />\nwill be hurt, and (b) if the honest<br />\nstudent still wishes to take the<br />\ncourse, at least he will know what<br />\nhe is going to be up against. The<br />\nHonor Commission should exist<br />\nto protect the honest ones. If it<br />\nrefuses to do that, it should pack<br />\nup andgo home.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 8, 1968<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nMusky Humbert, Election Protesters Caught Nixon Era Dawns<br />\n1 Humble Edmort<br />\nIn Lafayette Park Tangle As Nation Yawns,<br />\nDefeat NixA wng<br />\nSpiro T.

As far as the<br />\nfund is concerned, the federal funds can be ignored;federal money is<br />\nrarely allocated for capital purposes, and are always restrictive.<br />\nFurthermore, the Fund cannot, of course, solicit federal funds as the<br />\ngovernment decides upon its allocation.<br />\nThe private sector itself contains four separate sources of money:<br />\n1) wealthy non-alumni, 2) foundations, 3) alumni, and 4)<br />\ncorporations, whose financial support is sought by both professional<br />\nand volunteer money-raisers. The University cannot, however, use the<br />\nincome derived from these sources with any autonomy. Except for<br />\ngifts from alumni, the funds are usually restrictive\u2014invariably so if<br />\nthey are from foundation or corporations.<br />\nIn the period 1958-1967, foundations contributed approximately<br />\nhalf of all the funds received from the private sector, with the wealthy<br />\nnon-alumni contributions second with 28%. The high figure for<br />\nfoundations is the result of Hopkins rather privileged position among<br />\nfoundations because of its high academic standing, and also because<br />\nthe period was one of extreme generosity on the part of the Ford<br />\nFoundation.<br />\nYear-round Drives<br />\nWhile fund raising is a year-round job, the University from time to<br />\ntime undertakes major capital fund campaigns. The next drive, slated<br />\nfor 1969-1973, is being conducted to raise money for, among other<br />\nthings, the construction of an administrative building next to Levering<br />\nHall. Wealthy non-alumni are expected to contribute nearly half of<br />\nthe money for this drive, Dr. Burns stated.<br />\nIncome from the drive will, of course, be distributed among all of<br />\nthe Hopkins facilities, and will not be solely for construction on the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nThe need for capital expansion is such that one financial drive Will<br />\nin the future be immediately followed by another. The Hopkins fund<br />\nplanners expect that a three year campaign will follow the 1969-73<br />\ndrive.<br />\nTuition and Fund Raising<br />\nWhen asked what the relation was between rising tuition and<br />\ncapital fund raising, Burns said that they had little relation to each<br />\nother, as capital funds are entirely separate from the university s<br />\noperating budget. If the fund were ten times as successful as it is,<br />\nBurns continued, there would be no tuition rise; however, in general<br />\nany excess money (that over and above the target sum set by the<br />\ncampaign) would be spent in the capital area\u2014perhaps in the area of<br />\nendowment to hold down tuition.<br />\n.<br />\nr<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nEN tow gm mom Nom .1<br />\nII College Relations Director<br />\nI c/o Sheraton-Park Hotel, Washington, D.C. 20008<br /><br />\nPERFORMANCE<br />\nFrequency Response:<br />\n20 20,000 c p s , flat from<br />\n30 to 15,000 c PS \u2022 3db.<br />\nMaximum Input Power:<br />\n2 watts each phone<br />\nMaximum Acoustical Output:<br />\n138db s p I<br />\nImpedance:<br />\n8 ohms each phone<br />\nAttenuation of Ambient Noise:<br />\n40db at 1000 c.o.s.<br /><br />\nHarmonic Distortion:<br />\nDriven at 1 volt\u2022<br />\n50 cycles 1.7 %<br />\n200 cycles .35%<br />\n500 cycles .76%<br />\n1000 cycles .86%<br />\nSensitivity:<br />\n115 db re 0 0002 dyne CM\u00b0<br />\nat 1 volt input.<br />\nLateral Pressure:<br />\nApproximately 2 lbs.<br />\nover an area of<br />\n10 square inches<br /><br />\nMATERIAL<br />\nEar cups: Plastic high impact \"Cycolac.\" Shock and shatterproof.<br />\nEar seals: Vinyl.

The<br />\nCommittee is setting up study groups in each of the five academic<br />\nareas: engineering studies, quantitative studies, natural sciences,<br />\numanistic studies, and social and behavioral sciences. Each group will<br />\nave a membership of one professor and one undergraduate from each<br />\nepartment in its area and will study proposals on course offerings,<br />\n1.nterdepartmental courses and majors, departmental coordination,<br />\nclepartment goals, quality for instructions and requirements for<br />\nmajors. The study groups will also consider the need for informal<br />\nseminars and noncredit courses.<br />\nIn the future, the Committees on Undergraduate Studies will<br />\nreview the recommendations from these study groups as part of its<br />\nregular agenda. The Committee will also discuss the problems of the<br />\narop date, calendar reform, and Hopkins-Goucher course exchange.<br />\nGeorge Kirschbaum, student representative to the Traffic and<br />\nForking Committee, reported that the committee has met several<br />\ntimes this semester but has yet to find a way to solVe the serious<br />\nParking problems on campus.<br />\nAn ad hoc committee to review the Athletic Department has had<br />\n.5\u00b0111e preliminary meetings but has not begun any substantive<br />\ninvestigation.

The Committees on Student Affiars, the Bookstore,<br />\nthe Library, and Admissions and Financial Aid have not met this<br />\nsemester although all of them have student representatives and each of<br />\nthem affects important areas of student life.<br />\nThere is still no student voice on the Academic Council, the most<br />\nimportant policy-making forum at Homewood. The Council is holding<br />\nan informal meeting on November 12th to consider student<br />\nParticipation in its activities, but only two undergraduates will be<br />\nallowed to represent the entire student body.<br />\nFinally, the procedure for selecting student representatives and for<br />\nCollecting student opinions is still nebulous at best. The Student<br />\nCouncil hopes to remedy this situation by printing the names of all<br />\nstudent representatives in the Student Council Report which will be<br />\nissued in late November.

If the measure<br />\nwere approved, it would have to<br />\nbe submitted to a general student<br />\nreferendum for a final vote.<br />\nLecture Series<br />\nDuring the major part of the<br />\nmeeting, the Council approve.d<br />\nseveral important measures In<br />\nquick succession. A measure to<br />\nestablish two lecture series, one In<br />\nhonor of John F. and Robert<br />\nKennedy and the other In<br />\nmemory of Martin Luther King'<br />\nwas approved unanimously. The<br />\nKennedy series will focus on<br />\ninternational problems and th!<br />\nMann Luther King lectures will<br />\nexamine domestic issues. The S.C..<br />\nwill fund both series and will<br />\nschedule them each year<br />\n(<br />\naccording to the availability 0'<br />\nqualified speakers.<br />\nThe lectures this year will .he<br />\npresented during the spring<br />\nsemester. After approval of the<br />\ninitial proposal, Dean Rud\u00b0Y,<br />\nasked that Senator Edwaru<br />\nKennedy and Mrs. Coretta Kin.g<br />\nbe chosen as the first speakers In<br />\neach series. Again, approval was<br />\nunanimous.<br />\nCommunications<br />\nThe Council also gave quick<br />\napproval to the creation of .a<br />\nSpeakers Bureau The Bureau will<br />\nhandle all requests fr\u00b0111,<br />\ncommunity groups for studern<br />\nspeakers and will try to promote<br />\nmore dialogue between the<br />\nstudents and the people of the<br />\ncity in an attempt to get the<br />\nUniversity and the city to listen t\u00b0<br />\neach other. The Bureau will he<br />\nopen to all students who file au<br />\napplication with the Council.<br />\nFinally, the Council and the<br />\nDSRC agreed to send 4 free busses<br />\nto the Western Maryland football<br />\ngame on November 23rd, the last<br />\ngame of the season.

The $150 million invested in the Games<br />\nwas profitably used to construct the most magnificient complex of<br />\nathletic facilities anywhere in the world. The immense problems of<br />\narranging an event of such proportions in a country ripe with political<br />\nstrife and student unrest must not be overlooked.<br />\nToo loud was the voice of those pessimists who added to the near<br />\nschizophrenic air by predicting a disruption of the XIX Olympics<br />\nbecause of \"insurmountable hurdles.\" The rarefied air of the<br />\n'7,349-foot high Mexican capital, the battles between students and<br />\ntroops, the South African question, the threats of boycott by Negro<br />\nAmericans, and the Russian-Czechoslovakia tension\u2014at least one<br />\nwould cause an early end to the Games, if indeed they could be held<br />\nat all.<br />\nScarcity of oxygen, heat, and Mexican food drew complaints from<br />\nall sides, but the quality of performances and number of world<br />\nrecords broken served to demonstrate their relative insignificance. The<br />\nshooting of thirty-four students on October 10 has been termed<br />\nunnecessary, and undoubtedly it was. The Olympic Games cannot be<br />\nheld responsible for their deaths. Brutality of such a nature has not<br />\nbeen uncommon to our neighbor in the south.<br />\nThe questions raised by Carlos and Smith, South Africans, and the<br />\nCzech demonstration of hatred for Russia have raised as much<br />\npublicity as the unbelievable performance of several athletes. It is<br />\nright that they should, and hypocritical to maintain that the situation<br />\ncould be otherwise. Pragmatically speaking, there is no better place to<br />\ndemonstrate political or social dissent. Avery Brundage has served<br />\nwell, but in this one area he is the victim of severe misjudgement.<br />\nThere shall never be another Olympiad devoid of political overtones.<br />\nHow can there be, when all of the emphasis is on nation vs. nation and<br />\nnot on athlete against athlete? How often has it been boasted, \"We<br />\nwon 45 gold medals, and the Russians got only 29?\" How can<br />\nAmerican Negroes be expected to calmly represent a country which<br />\nthey feel does not respect them as citizens? Similarly, illegal<br />\nmedicines, dope tests, and rumors of scandal and payoffs will remain<br />\npermanent elements of the Olympics.<br />\nPerhaps the most rewarding outcome of the XIX Olympiad, at least<br />\nfrom the American outlook, was the outstanding performances of<br />\nU.S. athletes. Victories exceeded expectations in almost every<br />\nevent\u2014certainly in track and field, basketball, and swimming (where<br />\nthe most one-sided Olympic meet ever occurred.) A few names suffice<br />\nto demonstrate the United States superiority\u2014Jim Hines, Tommie<br />\nSmith, Al Oerter Bill Toomey, Bob Beamon, Bob Seagren, Randy<br />\nMatson, Wyomia Tyus, and Dick Fosbury in track and field; Debbie<br />\nMeyer, Mike Burton, Charlie Hickcox, and Doug Russell in swimming;<br />\nGeorge Foreman in boxing; Bill Steinkraus in grand prix jumping; and<br />\nGary Anderson in free rifle shooting. The list continues, seemingly<br />\nwithout end.<br />\nAlso notable were our team performances. Basketball, predicted to<br />\nbe the most embarrassing event for the U.S., proved to be a highlight<br />\nof the Games. Coach Hank lba was determined to preserve an<br />\nunblemished record, and his charges did so handsomely. The absence<br />\nof such personages as Alcindor, Hayes, and Unseld made the victory<br />\neven more spectacular. Russia and Yugoslavia had best content<br />\nthemselves with trying for the silver in the future.<br />\nThe victories of American women competitors deserve note. Their<br />\nendeavors were much improved over those in Tokyo in<br />\n1964-especially in swimming.<br />\nOne final observation on the Mexican Games\u2014the competition has<br />\nbecome so intense that it would appear to place an age restriction on<br />\nmost events. The average age on an Olympiac looks to be declining.<br />\nFantastically improved performances last month came predominately<br />\nfrom the furor of the contests. Said Billy Toomey, California school<br />\nteacher and outstanding gold medal winner in the decathlon, \"I've<br />\nnever had to endure anything.so intense. They shouldn't call this the<br />\nOlympic Games. It's not a game out there.\"<br />\nIt's no game because no one wants it that way.

The passing<br />\nand rushing attacks were<br />\noutstanding; the defensive line<br />\nwas strong; and the secondary<br />\npicked off seven \"Mellon\" passes.<br />\nThe score wasn't lopsided only<br />\nbecause Lance Squires, the<br />\nCarnegie quarterback, didn't care<br />\nhow many of his passes were<br />\nintercepted.<br />\nHe threw 51 passes and<br />\ncompleted 25 of them to his<br />\nreceivers. Squires tossed five<br />\ntouchdown passes and rang up<br />\n402 yards through the air. After<br />\nhaving been trampled the week<br />\nbefore by Randolph Macon's<br />\nHoward Stevens, the Jays found<br />\nthe Carnegie Mellon offense an<br />\ninteresting contrast.<br />\nCowan and Weiss Star<br />\nThe Mellon defense, however,<br />\nwas much less of a hassle. Joe<br />\nCowan and Paul Weiss stepped<br /><br />\nthrough gaping holes in the<br />\nMellon line and between them<br />\ngained 350 yards. Jim Feely threw<br />\nwith prudence and completed<br />\nbetter than 50% of his passes. His<br />\nsingle mistake, however, provided<br />\na dramatic lift for the opposition<br />\nat a time when the Jays were<br />\nabout to administer a knockout<br />\nblow.<br />\nHopkins held a 27-12 halftime<br />\nlead and proceeded to take the<br />\nsecond half kickoff in for a score,<br />\na drive culminating in a six yard<br />\nrun by Paul Weiss. They were<br />\nmarching minutes later for<br />\nperhaps the clinching score when<br />\nReggin Cherray intercepted a<br />\nFeely pass in the Carnegie end<br />\nzone and returned it 102 yards for<br />\na touchdown; Hopkin's lead was<br />\nsliced to 33-18. Then Squires<br />\nthrew another scoring pass and<br />\nthe score now stood at 33-26.<br />\nBut Joe Cowan had yet to<br />\nmake his full presence felt. Paul<br />\nWeiss had been the workhorse of<br />\nthe first half, registering two,<br />\ntouchdowns, one on a short<br />\nplunge and the other on a 42<br />\nyard Feely pass. In the second<br />\nhalf, Cowan took over. He raced<br />\n42 yards for a Hopkins'<br />\ntouchdown to advance the score<br />\nto 41-26; when the Jays got the<br /><br />\nBaby Jays First Win<br />\nSaves Losing Record<br />\nBY MIKE SHORE<br />\nThe frosh football team<br />\nbecame winners for the first time<br />\nthis season, when they defeated<br />\nthe Susquehanna Junior Varsity<br />\nby a score of 16-6, at<br />\nSusquehanna.<br />\nSusquehanna came into the<br />\ngame with a very respectable 2-1<br />\nrecord, including victories over<br />\nWestern Maryland and Lycoming,<br />\nand their only loss to Stevens<br />\nTech. This was opposed to our<br />\nsquad's mediocre 0-1 record after<br />\nlast week's loss to F&amp;M.<br />\nThe game started off on a<br />\ndisappointing note when<br />\nSusquehanna took the opening<br />\nkick-off and moved downfield like<br />\na juggernaut to the Hopkins six<br />\nfor a first down. Then the<br />\nHopkins defense showed the stuff<br />\nof which football players are<br />\nmade. After four successive<br />\nrunning plays failed to score, the<br />\nfrosh took over on the one foot<br />\nline.

The drive was<br />\nhighlighted by two Bud Whalen to<br />\nDave Pickall passed for 27 and 21<br />\nyards respectively.<br />\nLet the Tough Get Going<br />\nThe drive was brought to a<br />\nsuccessful conclusion by Steve<br />\nUtz's 5 yard plunge for the first of<br />\nhis two touchdowns.

The 10-6 score at<br />\nthis point was as close as they<br />\ncame for the duration.<br />\nHowever, the game's quota of<br />\nexcitement was not yet<br />\nexhausted. Towards the end of<br />\nthe fourth quarter Susquehanna<br />\nbegan to act as if they were going<br />\nto score again. They reached the<br />\nHopkins 30, but the defense once<br />\nagain handled them. Led by Bud<br />\nCleveland, they threw the QB for<br />\nseveral losses and forced him to<br />\nthrow the ball to an ineligible<br />\nreceiver for a penalty.<br />\nAfter another exchange of<br />\npunts, once again Steve Utz<br />\nscored\u2014this time with only 30<br />\nseconds left, bringing his yardage<br />\ntotal to 91 on 38 carries.

Coach<br />\nBarrette described the Hopkins<br />\neffort as \"flat\".<br />\n\"The Same Old Song\"<br />\nSaturday afternoon it was<br />\nmuch the same story--an inability<br />\nto score. Loyola goals came in the<br />\nfirst quarter on a screen shot that<br />\nHop goalie Avery saw too late to<br />\nstop, and in the second period on<br />\nan excellent midair shot by<br />\nLoyola booter Ty Smith.<br />\nAdding injury to insult, last<br />\nweek's winners left a host of Hops<br /><br />\ndisabled in their wake.

Perhaps<br />\nbecause he is the team captain and<br />\nloaded with a captain's<br />\nresponsibilities he sees soccer<br />\nmore as a cause than his team<br />\nmates.
