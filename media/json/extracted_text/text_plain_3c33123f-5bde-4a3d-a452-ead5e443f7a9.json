The ability of<br />\nthese men as actors was recognized, but their capabilities in the coaching line were unknown. That they are equally capable both as actors<br />\nand coaches is now apparent.<br />\nThe production and property staff both performed capably. The<br />\ndifficult sound effects were excellent, and not a single slip was<br />\napparent on either evening. The cast was well chosen, and performed<br />\nremarkably well on the whole.<br />\nIt seems quite regrettable the Barnstormers believe it impossible to<br />\ngive any further performances. We are sure that this year's production if given out of town, would be a credit to both the club and the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n<br />\nPURE FOOTBALL<br />\n<br />\nFROM a recent issue of the Brown and<br />\n<br />\nWhite, student newspaper<br />\nof Lehigh University, we learn that the lone athletic scholarship<br />\nformerly offered at that institution has been withdrawn, and that the<br />\nfaculty has passed a resolution by unanimous vote requesting the Board<br />\nof Control of Athletics to present for future faculty approval only<br />\nthose schedules which were confined to schools whose athletics are<br />\nunder scholastic and amateur standards. This is a worthy endeavor.<br />\nHowever, we doubt that Lehigh could find enough suitable opponents<br />\nwhose athletic records are absolutely pure. If the fact that no athletic<br />\nscholarships were awarded, proved that the institution were athletically<br />\npure then little trouble would be met in arranging a schedule. This<br />\nis not the principal factor in the professionalism of college athletics.<br />\nThe idea has been advanced that with the expansion of professional<br />\nfootball, professionalism in colleges will die out. If the administrations and athletic boards of educational institutions had complete control of the situation, pure athletics could be obtained. However, it is<br />\nthe alumni of the colleges and universities who are largely responsible<br />\nfor the present conditions. They must have their good football teams<br />\nand as long as they continue to financially support students, professionalism will remain. It sounds very fine to say that no athletic<br />\nscholarships are awarded, but as long as certain alumni regard the<br />\nstanding of the football team as more important than the educational<br />\nstandards of the institution, college athletics will not be pure and athletic scholarships will be of no importance.<br />\n<br />\n.1-<br />\n<br />\nSWEATERS<br />\nE are glad to note the athletic authorities finally awarded the<br />\nWsweaters<br />\nto the track and lacrosse teams of last year at this early<br />\nfor them to settle their differences<br />\n<br />\ndate. It certainly took long enough<br />\nwith a certain sporting goods company.<br />\n<br />\nSketches Moody's Life<br />\n<br />\nDr. French sketched rather hastily the life of Moody. From the<br />\nbeginning, existence was a real<br />\nstruggle for him, his mother and<br />\nfather both having died when he<br />\nhad reached the age of fifteen.<br />\nMoody's early life was spent in<br />\nboth teaching a country school and<br />\nprivate pupils. The latter occupation presented him with an opportunity to travel abroad in Greece<br />\nand Italy, an experience most valuable to him when he turned to<br />\npoetry.<br />\n\"Harvard College,\" said Dr.<br />\nFrench, \"where he took his master's degree was the next scene of<br />\nhis life. Again Moody returned to<br />\nteaching, which he then considered most unpleasant, since there<br />\nburned in him a desire to give expression to the emotions welling<br />\nwithin him. Soon his plays met<br />\nwith bountiful success and he severed his teaching connection.<br />\nMoody Affected by Conditions<br />\n\"It is claimed that much of his<br />\n<br />\npoetry savors of the old English<br />\nstyle. While this is quite true in<br />\nitself, there is unquestioned originality of thought and imagination<br />\nwoven into his themes.<br />\n\"Moody, like other twentieth<br />\ncentury writers was affected tremendously by the development of<br />\nsocial problems and conditions, and<br />\nthis note appears in much of his<br />\ncomposition. In his 'The Great Divide,' Moody depicts with penetrating keenness the vast difference<br />\nbetween the rugged and open western mind and the fine, thin New<br />\nEngland mind, both of which he<br />\nunderstood and evaluated unerringly because of his intimate association with both sections.\"<br />\nPlay Has Specific Origin<br />\n<br />\nAs is true of most of his works,<br />\nthe speaker affirmed, the theme for<br />\nthe \"Faith Healer\", has a specific<br />\norigin. It is contended that he received the inspiration for this play<br />\nfrom one Schlatter, who believing<br />\nhe was commanding the voice of<br />\nGod, went about the country working miracles among the sick. Schlatter, in his travels, meets a woman.<br />\nRhoda, with whom he falls in love.<br />\nFeeling this inconsistent with his<br />\ncommission, he becomes discouraged and abandons his practice. In<br />\nhis saner reflections, however, he<br />\nsees the absurdity of this idea, and<br />\nbegins anew his appointed work.<br />\nThe play, Dr. French asserted,<br />\nfollows pretty closely on these<br />\nlines.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014.7.<br />\n<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE<br />\nNEWS<br />\nAccording to Michigan State<br />\nNews, the freshmen up there must<br />\nhave taken it into their heads to kid<br />\nthe profs, as no one\u2014not even<br />\nfreshmen\u2014could naturally be so<br />\ndumb.

The ability of<br />\nthese men as actors was recognized, but their capabilities in the coaching line were unknown. That they are equally capable both as actors<br />\nand coaches is now apparent.<br />\nThe production and property staff both performed capably. The<br />\ndifficult sound effects were excellent, and not a single slip was<br />\napparent on either evening. The cast was well chosen, and performed<br />\nremarkably well on the whole.<br />\nIt seems quite regrettable the Barnstormers believe it impossible to<br />\ngive any further performances. We are sure that this year's production if given out of town, would be a credit to both the club and the<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nPURE FOOTBALL<br /><br />\nFROM a recent issue of the Brown and<br /><br />\nWhite, student newspaper<br />\nof Lehigh University, we learn that the lone athletic scholarship<br />\nformerly offered at that institution has been withdrawn, and that the<br />\nfaculty has passed a resolution by unanimous vote requesting the Board<br />\nof Control of Athletics to present for future faculty approval only<br />\nthose schedules which were confined to schools whose athletics are<br />\nunder scholastic and amateur standards. This is a worthy endeavor.<br />\nHowever, we doubt that Lehigh could find enough suitable opponents<br />\nwhose athletic records are absolutely pure. If the fact that no athletic<br />\nscholarships were awarded, proved that the institution were athletically<br />\npure then little trouble would be met in arranging a schedule. This<br />\nis not the principal factor in the professionalism of college athletics.<br />\nThe idea has been advanced that with the expansion of professional<br />\nfootball, professionalism in colleges will die out. If the administrations and athletic boards of educational institutions had complete control of the situation, pure athletics could be obtained. However, it is<br />\nthe alumni of the colleges and universities who are largely responsible<br />\nfor the present conditions. They must have their good football teams<br />\nand as long as they continue to financially support students, professionalism will remain. It sounds very fine to say that no athletic<br />\nscholarships are awarded, but as long as certain alumni regard the<br />\nstanding of the football team as more important than the educational<br />\nstandards of the institution, college athletics will not be pure and athletic scholarships will be of no importance.<br /><br />\n.1-<br /><br />\nSWEATERS<br />\nE are glad to note the athletic authorities finally awarded the<br />\nWsweaters<br />\nto the track and lacrosse teams of last year at this early<br />\nfor them to settle their differences<br /><br />\ndate. It certainly took long enough<br />\nwith a certain sporting goods company.<br /><br />\nSketches Moody's Life<br /><br />\nDr. French sketched rather hastily the life of Moody. From the<br />\nbeginning, existence was a real<br />\nstruggle for him, his mother and<br />\nfather both having died when he<br />\nhad reached the age of fifteen.<br />\nMoody's early life was spent in<br />\nboth teaching a country school and<br />\nprivate pupils. The latter occupation presented him with an opportunity to travel abroad in Greece<br />\nand Italy, an experience most valuable to him when he turned to<br />\npoetry.<br />\n\"Harvard College,\" said Dr.<br />\nFrench, \"where he took his master's degree was the next scene of<br />\nhis life. Again Moody returned to<br />\nteaching, which he then considered most unpleasant, since there<br />\nburned in him a desire to give expression to the emotions welling<br />\nwithin him. Soon his plays met<br />\nwith bountiful success and he severed his teaching connection.<br />\nMoody Affected by Conditions<br />\n\"It is claimed that much of his<br /><br />\npoetry savors of the old English<br />\nstyle. While this is quite true in<br />\nitself, there is unquestioned originality of thought and imagination<br />\nwoven into his themes.<br />\n\"Moody, like other twentieth<br />\ncentury writers was affected tremendously by the development of<br />\nsocial problems and conditions, and<br />\nthis note appears in much of his<br />\ncomposition. In his 'The Great Divide,' Moody depicts with penetrating keenness the vast difference<br />\nbetween the rugged and open western mind and the fine, thin New<br />\nEngland mind, both of which he<br />\nunderstood and evaluated unerringly because of his intimate association with both sections.\"<br />\nPlay Has Specific Origin<br /><br />\nAs is true of most of his works,<br />\nthe speaker affirmed, the theme for<br />\nthe \"Faith Healer\", has a specific<br />\norigin. It is contended that he received the inspiration for this play<br />\nfrom one Schlatter, who believing<br />\nhe was commanding the voice of<br />\nGod, went about the country working miracles among the sick. Schlatter, in his travels, meets a woman.<br />\nRhoda, with whom he falls in love.<br />\nFeeling this inconsistent with his<br />\ncommission, he becomes discouraged and abandons his practice. In<br />\nhis saner reflections, however, he<br />\nsees the absurdity of this idea, and<br />\nbegins anew his appointed work.<br />\nThe play, Dr. French asserted,<br />\nfollows pretty closely on these<br />\nlines.<br /><br />\n\u2014.7.<br /><br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE<br />\nNEWS<br />\nAccording to Michigan State<br />\nNews, the freshmen up there must<br />\nhave taken it into their heads to kid<br />\nthe profs, as no one\u2014not even<br />\nfreshmen\u2014could naturally be so<br />\ndumb.
