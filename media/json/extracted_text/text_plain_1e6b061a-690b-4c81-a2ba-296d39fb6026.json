Clark, a<br />\nthirty-two year old native of New<br />\nMexico, will soon be leaving<br />\nHopkins to assume an Associate<br />\nProfessorship in English at the<br />\nUniversity of Florida. He<br />\nreflected on his four years at<br />\nHopkins with pleasure, adding<br />\nthat \"I've learned more at<br />\nHopkins than I've learned<br />\nanywhere else,\" but \"It's a good<br />\ntime to leave.\"<br />\n\"I came here because it was<br />\nthe best place and tiny, which<br />\nmeant that I got to be around all<br />\nthe big people,\" Clark pointed<br />\nout. Before coming to Hopkins,<br />\nIra Clark completed his graduate<br />\ndegrees at Northwestern<br />\nUniversity and did a two-year<br />\nhitch in the Army in Military<br />\nIntelligence.<br />\nUngraded School<br />\nAfter the Army, Clark<br />\nexplained, he was eager to get<br />\nback into literary criticism. Hired<br />\nas an assistant professor at<br />\nHopkins, Clark appreciated the<br />\nopportunity to \"study\" under,<br />\nD.C. Allen, Jackson Cope, and<br />\nEarl Wasserman.<br />\n<br />\n\"Being an Assistant Professor<br />\nhere is like being a student and<br />\ngoing through an ungraded<br />\nschool. There really isn't any<br />\nexpectation that a person will<br />\nstay,\" noted the Milton<br />\nspecialist.<br />\n\"I think I now basically<br />\nunderstand how Allen, Cope,and<br />\nWasserman do what they do,\"<br />\ncontinued Clark, adding with a<br />\nlaugh, \"I guess it's time to go<br />\nlearn from somebody else.\"<br />\nThoughtful looking, but with<br />\ncheerful blue eyes, Ira Clark loves<br />\nhis job teaching undergraduates.<br />\nBorn into a family of teachers, he<br />\ngrinned, \"I can't imagine doing<br />\nanything else!\"<br />\nProfessing a philosophy that a<br />\nteacher is someone who never<br />\nquits learning, Clark makes the<br />\nmost of teacher -student<br />\ninteraction in his small seminars.<br />\nHis aim in teaching is to<br />\nstimulate students to analyze<br />\ntheir reactions and then, \"convey<br />\nexcitement to them and make<br />\nthem interested enough to read<br />\nin an active way.\"<br />\nHopkins students, in Clark's<br />\nopinion, are often competitive in<br />\na healthy way. He approves of<br />\nthe competitive feeling which<br />\nstimulates a student to really get<br />\n<br />\nSC rejects new Honor<br />\nCommission proposals<br />\nLast night's Student Council<br />\nmeeting while covering a number<br />\nof topics, saw only two actions,<br />\none formal and one informal.<br />\nThe SC passed a motion<br />\nrejecting the Honor<br />\nCommission's proposed new<br />\nconstitution. The motion also<br />\ncalled for a council committee to<br />\nprepare a list of the Council's<br />\nobjections for the Honor<br />\nCommission.<br />\nInformally, President Gerry<br />\nBates thanked Council members<br />\nand others who had worked to<br />\nmake \"3400 On Stage\" what he<br />\ntermed \"an outstanding success.\"<br />\nReaction<br />\nThe motion which rejected the<br />\nnew Honor Commission<br />\nConstitution also called for an SC<br />\ncommittee, to be chaired by<br />\nJunior Class Representative Steve<br />\nLeGendre, to list the council's<br />\n<br />\nobjections for the use of the<br />\nHonor Commission in preparing a<br />\nnew revision.<br />\nCouncil objections seemed to<br />\ncenter around certain changes<br />\nproposed by an earlier revision<br />\ncommittee consisting of four<br />\nHonor Commission members, a<br />\nfaculty member, and LeGendre.<br />\nThese changes were deleted from<br />\nthe final Honor Commission<br />\nversion.<br />\nAccording to LeGendre, the<br />\nimportant changes deleted<br />\nincluded a provision for the<br />\naccused student to confront his<br />\naccuser (unless the charge is<br />\nanonymous), and an alteration to<br />\nallow students to be defended by<br />\nanyone within the University.<br />\ncommunity. Under the present<br />\nconstitution, the defender must<br />\nbe a member of the Honor<br />\nCommission.<br />\n<br />\ninto the reading of a poem or<br />\nnovel. Grades don't seem to be<br />\nthe major concern of students in<br />\nEnglish, he noted with<br />\nsatisfaction.<br />\nTheological Patterns<br />\n\"Finding secularized versions<br />\nof theological patterns in<br />\nliterature\" is one of Ira Clark's<br />\ncreative reading perspectives and<br />\nhe tries to encourage his students<br />\nto invent their own frameworks.<br />\n\"A student who feeds back the<br />\nprofessor's opinions in his papers<br />\nmay be doing it because he<br />\nthinks that's what the teacher<br />\nwants, or he may be insecure,\"<br />\nClark speculated. He feels that<br />\nthe undergraduate should learn<br />\nto trust his own instincts and feel<br />\ncomfortable expressing and<br />\nexplaining his feelings about a<br />\npiece of literature.<br />\nClark has obviously found<br />\nHopkins to be a pleasurable and<br />\nprofitable experience.

The consideration of changes in the<br />\nundergraduate academic program that might actually<br />\ntake place is heartening, and undergraduates will be<br />\njustified in looking for improvements in their academic<br />\nlot.

It still has to<br />\nundergo revision in the Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies before the Academic Council looks at it to<br />\nmake their own amendments.

She removed the roses and the dahlias<br />\nfrom the window display and transferred them to<br />\nthe refrigerator, pausing to make sure that the temperature was correctly set. With deft fingers she<br />\ngathered up the unused asparagus fern and arranged it in a soft air-filled pyramid, to be used<br />\ntomorrow. Making a circle of efficiency about the<br />\nshop, she picked up loose bits of florist's tape, wire<br />\n, leaves, stray petals, and the day's debris left by<br />\nthoughtless customers\u2014 cigarette butts, half-written<br />\nand discarded greeting cards\u2014 and relegated what<br />\ncould be salvaged to various nooks and drawers,<br />\nthrowing out what could not. In a last look about<br />\nthe shop, Ruth remembered to make a mental note<br />\nof tomorrow's special orders: a baseball arrangement for a small boy hospitalized with a broken<br />\nleg, an expensive orchid arrangement for a rich,<br />\ncancerous old lady. Then, going to the refrigerator,<br />\nher hand trembling ever so slightly, she carefully<br />\nchose an armful of her freshest spring flowers.<br />\nLeaving, Ruth's lips<br />\ntightened into a little frown that was customary,<br />\nbut that had rooted there so slowly and insidiously<br />\nover the years that she herself was barely aware of<br />\nit. At thirty-five, she knew that she was not an<br />\nextraordinary woman, but she prided herself on<br />\nher principles and on her dignity: she possessed<br />\nmuch of both. Of desire, she admitted nothing<br />\nmore than her desire to excel in her work; of impulses, she had only been 6ducated to ignore them;<br />\nof passion, she was ignorant. She realized that the<br />\nYears of fending for herself had taken their toll and<br />\n\u2022 that she had become settled in her little ways.<br />\nLong ago, she had tried to adjust to certain resignations that she felt she must make: Ruth knew<br />\nthat she was mousy and that her clothes of dull<br />\nblues and greys were not eye- catching, but she<br />\nwould have been embarrassed to appear in the vibrant reds and golds of her flowers. She had tried<br />\nto accept her chin, which she hated, and thought<br />\n*'<br />\ntoo small, and to accept living alone. Lately, more<br />\nOften than usual, it had begun to bother her that<br />\nshe was quickly slipping past the child-bearing<br />\nYears, but when this fear tried to surface in her, she<br />\nwould immediately bury herself in her flowers, and<br />\nthere she could find enough of contentment to sustain herself.<br />\nFor if there had been<br />\nthere<br />\nhad<br />\nalso been successes.<br />\ndisappointments,<br />\nThere was her shop. While it was not large or unusual, it did a brisk business, and Ruth felt that she<br />\nbrought something of art as well as competence to<br />\nher , Located on the ground floor of a sprawling metropolitan hospital, the shop received most of<br />\nthe business that the hospital's clientele brought in,<br />\nin addition to some external business earned by the<br />\nexcellent, if quiet, reputation that Ruth had gained<br />\nin the city. Then, too, she had made friends: Ruth<br />\nfrequently had coffee with the nurses. Secretly, she<br />\nthought some of them a little immoral: she knew<br />\nthat several of the unmarried ones had relationships with men. They kept coaxing her into letting<br />\nthem arrange a date for her with a man, but she<br />\nalways declined, knowing her chin was awful,<br />\ndreading not knowing what to say. \"Ruthie,\" they<br />\nwould tease, \"don't be such an old maid.\"\"Hush\"<br />\nshe always answered, \"ask one of the younger<br />\ngirls,\" and she would try to conceal her lonliness<br />\nfor a man and the certainty that she would be<br />\nrejected with an unsuccessful laugh that soured in<br />\n<br />\ni. ....,.<br />\n<br />\ni\u2022-,.-;,;.:.:71\u2018,..<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\ng ,..\u2018'....\u2022 ....:t.,.,<br />\n<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n'<br />\n4 T<br />\n:n \u2022i<br />\n'VI\"'<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n..\u2022 I<br />\nillt\u2022'...6,<br />\n<br />\n\u20221;..-0I<br />\n\u2022\u2014<br />\n<br />\n,.....<br />\n<br />\n\u2022.... ,<br />\n..'<br />\n4tk<br />\n:.%:.<br />\n...,': *<br />\n.,.<br />\n<br />\n,.......,,<br />\n2,2 \u201e.\u2018 .,...<br />\n..t.<br />\n<br />\n. z.<br />\n<br />\n---:\".<br />\n,<br />\n,ti\u2018<br />\n\\,\u0300<br />\n1'!:* 11<br />\n.....\"4111v,:e \\\\<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\n'\u2018\u2018O<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nzik3:4,44041... \\<br />\n<br />\noh\\%<br />\ni\"k\\\u2018<br />\n.kf<br />\nt.,04t41<br />\n41'<br />\n<br />\nher throat like a lie.<br />\n<br />\nwere her art.

But there wasn't really<br />\nexceptionally much in the way of<br />\nentertainment. Unless you enjoy rides on<br />\none of those little trains like they had at<br />\nthe beach two summers ago. Or unless<br />\nyou have a feeling for Hopkins' special<br />\nsense of humor.<br />\nIt all started Friday, just before noon,<br />\nwhen I was heading to the infirmary to<br />\nget shot up with my weekly allergy<br />\ninjection. In front of the library was a<br />\nscattered gathering of people,<br />\nanticipating the gala opening ceremonies<br />\nof the festival. I thought I noticed a<br />\ncouple of cameras (I was going to watch<br />\nthe news that night to see if we made it. I<br />\nremember viewing the local news last<br />\nyear the night the last president had<br />\nresigned. They had interviews with<br />\ntypical students in front of the dorms;<br />\nand you could see the lacrosse balls<br />\nwhizzing in the background.) A<br />\ncontingent from the band was torturing<br />\nsome Ta-da-de-dum type song,<br />\npunctuated by beats on a big drum with<br />\nthe University seal on it. Dr. Muller was<br />\nthere, clearing his voice, getting ready to<br />\nmake his speech. It was hardly a<br />\n<br />\nmuseum<br />\n<br />\nmomentous occasion. In fact, it was<br />\nverging on the pitiful. So I went on to the<br />\ninfirmary smiling,(or was that wrong??).<br />\nOn the way back, I was the staging of<br />\nthe-anti-war demonstration that had been<br />\nhinted at all week. It was a rather<br />\npleasant affair\u2014staged on the grass near<br />\nthe dorms behind Homewood House,<br />\nthat serene monument to Baltimore's<br />\ngolden days. It was, on the one hand,<br />\nheartening to see the Movement moving<br />\nagain and the .return to the Fifties<br />\npostponed. And on the other hand, it<br />\nseemed so mechanical, almost<br />\nhalf-hearted, as if they had all done this<br />\nso many times before, that they all<br />\ninstinctively knew the right movements.<br />\nIt was during this affair that the<br />\nabsurdity overwhelmed me.<br />\nYou could hear stereos from the dorms<br />\nblasting old Beatles songs out the<br />\nwindows. Guys were running back and<br />\nforth at the rear of the audience, tossing<br />\naround lacrosse balls (so you could know<br />\nit was Johns Hopkins). People were<br />\ncarrying helium-filled balloons as they<br />\nsprawled out on the grass. Some were<br />\neating their lunches. Some were<br />\ncelebrity -watching, picking out<br />\nprominent faculty membets in the crowd.<br />\nDr. Muller (I still remember how angry<br />\nyou were with his statement that the<br />\nPresident's house on campus was not a fit<br />\nplace to bring up his daughters) had<br />\nwalked around from where he had just<br />\nfinished his festival speech and was<br />\nclearing his throat in readiness for his<br />\ndemonstration speech.

Once again the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense held a competent<br />\nOpposition attack unit to a<br />\nmeager five goal output while the<br />\nyoung Hopkins attack again<br />\nproved its superiority against<br />\nsome of the best defensemen in<br />\nthe country.<br />\nBlack Knight defenders Tom<br />\nO'Leary, Bill Heilman, and Tom<br />\nFitzsimmons teamed up to hold<br />\nBlue Jay standout Jack Thomas<br />\nto a mere 2 goals and 3 assists,<br />\nbut Billy Nolan and Don Krohn<br />\ntook up the slack, scoring 3 or 4<br />\ngoals respectively.<br />\nKrohn and Nolan came up<br />\nwith the most demoralizing play<br />\nof the game as soon as action<br />\nresumed following a slashing<br />\npenalty on Thomas six and one<br />\n<br />\nhalf minutes into the first period.<br />\nHopkins was leading 2-0, but<br />\nArmy had an excellent<br />\nopportunity to cut the lead in<br />\nhalf on this extra man situation.<br />\nInstead, Krohn intercepted the<br />\nArmy clearing pass at midfield<br />\nand found Nolan open for a fast<br />\nbreak. Nolan capitalized with his<br />\nthird goal of the period and the<br />\nCadets never fully recovered.<br />\nA few minutes later Les<br />\nMatthews came up with a<br />\nbeautiful save when Rick<br />\nGoodhand splashed a bounce<br />\nshot at his feet. Army came back<br />\nup the field after O'Leary<br />\nsmothered both Thomas and<br />\nNolan, the Black Knights finally<br />\nscoring as Captain Frank Eich<br />\nbroke free and cut across the<br />\ncrease to convert a Phil Lynch<br />\nfeed.<br />\nDominate<br />\nIn the second quarter Hopkins<br />\ncontinued to dominate all aspects<br />\nof the game, while the Blue Jays<br />\n<br />\nPat mram and Harry Stringer digfor loose ball in the mud as Rick<br />\nNowalchuk watches.<br />\n<br />\ndefense held the Cadets to only<br />\nthree shots on goal. Taking as<br />\nmany shots in this period as<br />\nArmy had in the whole first half,<br />\nHopkins pushed the score to 8-1<br />\nbefore the Black Knights could<br />\nscore again.<br />\nThomas netted the sixth Blue<br />\nJay goal in spite of Bill Heilman's<br />\neffective poke-checking to open a<br />\nHopkins barrage of three goals<br />\nwithin two minutes. Forty-seven<br />\nseconds later freshman Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon notched his second<br />\ntally of the spring after coming<br />\nup with the ball in a mud<br />\nsplattered face off tangle.

The<br />\nensuing shot was hard, high and<br />\ngoal-bound, but Les got his stick<br />\nin the way and started a<br />\nsuccessful clear.<br />\nClosing Minutes<br />\nIn the closing minutes of the<br />\nquarter, O'Leary, a sophomore<br />\nand the most impressive<br />\nindividual defenseman Hopkins<br />\nhas seen all season, started a fast<br />\nbreak clear that resulted in Russ<br />\nBolling's third goal of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe game ended with Thomas<br />\ncontinuing his campaign for the<br />\nscoring championship, as he<br />\ncontributed on all three Blue Jay<br />\nfourth quarter goals. First,<br />\nThomas found Mike Perez open<br />\nat the crease, with Mike<br />\nconverting the feed just before<br />\nhis defender recovered. Two<br />\nminutes later, Thomas worked<br />\nO'Leary around the goal, getting<br />\nthe defensive star to slip in the<br />\nmud off the left pipe.

Clark, a<br />\nthirty-two year old native of New<br />\nMexico, will soon be leaving<br />\nHopkins to assume an Associate<br />\nProfessorship in English at the<br />\nUniversity of Florida. He<br />\nreflected on his four years at<br />\nHopkins with pleasure, adding<br />\nthat \"I've learned more at<br />\nHopkins than I've learned<br />\nanywhere else,\" but \"It's a good<br />\ntime to leave.\"<br />\n\"I came here because it was<br />\nthe best place and tiny, which<br />\nmeant that I got to be around all<br />\nthe big people,\" Clark pointed<br />\nout. Before coming to Hopkins,<br />\nIra Clark completed his graduate<br />\ndegrees at Northwestern<br />\nUniversity and did a two-year<br />\nhitch in the Army in Military<br />\nIntelligence.<br />\nUngraded School<br />\nAfter the Army, Clark<br />\nexplained, he was eager to get<br />\nback into literary criticism. Hired<br />\nas an assistant professor at<br />\nHopkins, Clark appreciated the<br />\nopportunity to \"study\" under,<br />\nD.C. Allen, Jackson Cope, and<br />\nEarl Wasserman.<br /><br />\n\"Being an Assistant Professor<br />\nhere is like being a student and<br />\ngoing through an ungraded<br />\nschool. There really isn't any<br />\nexpectation that a person will<br />\nstay,\" noted the Milton<br />\nspecialist.<br />\n\"I think I now basically<br />\nunderstand how Allen, Cope,and<br />\nWasserman do what they do,\"<br />\ncontinued Clark, adding with a<br />\nlaugh, \"I guess it's time to go<br />\nlearn from somebody else.\"<br />\nThoughtful looking, but with<br />\ncheerful blue eyes, Ira Clark loves<br />\nhis job teaching undergraduates.<br />\nBorn into a family of teachers, he<br />\ngrinned, \"I can't imagine doing<br />\nanything else!\"<br />\nProfessing a philosophy that a<br />\nteacher is someone who never<br />\nquits learning, Clark makes the<br />\nmost of teacher -student<br />\ninteraction in his small seminars.<br />\nHis aim in teaching is to<br />\nstimulate students to analyze<br />\ntheir reactions and then, \"convey<br />\nexcitement to them and make<br />\nthem interested enough to read<br />\nin an active way.\"<br />\nHopkins students, in Clark's<br />\nopinion, are often competitive in<br />\na healthy way. He approves of<br />\nthe competitive feeling which<br />\nstimulates a student to really get<br /><br />\nSC rejects new Honor<br />\nCommission proposals<br />\nLast night's Student Council<br />\nmeeting while covering a number<br />\nof topics, saw only two actions,<br />\none formal and one informal.<br />\nThe SC passed a motion<br />\nrejecting the Honor<br />\nCommission's proposed new<br />\nconstitution. The motion also<br />\ncalled for a council committee to<br />\nprepare a list of the Council's<br />\nobjections for the Honor<br />\nCommission.<br />\nInformally, President Gerry<br />\nBates thanked Council members<br />\nand others who had worked to<br />\nmake \"3400 On Stage\" what he<br />\ntermed \"an outstanding success.\"<br />\nReaction<br />\nThe motion which rejected the<br />\nnew Honor Commission<br />\nConstitution also called for an SC<br />\ncommittee, to be chaired by<br />\nJunior Class Representative Steve<br />\nLeGendre, to list the council's<br /><br />\nobjections for the use of the<br />\nHonor Commission in preparing a<br />\nnew revision.<br />\nCouncil objections seemed to<br />\ncenter around certain changes<br />\nproposed by an earlier revision<br />\ncommittee consisting of four<br />\nHonor Commission members, a<br />\nfaculty member, and LeGendre.<br />\nThese changes were deleted from<br />\nthe final Honor Commission<br />\nversion.<br />\nAccording to LeGendre, the<br />\nimportant changes deleted<br />\nincluded a provision for the<br />\naccused student to confront his<br />\naccuser (unless the charge is<br />\nanonymous), and an alteration to<br />\nallow students to be defended by<br />\nanyone within the University.<br />\ncommunity. Under the present<br />\nconstitution, the defender must<br />\nbe a member of the Honor<br />\nCommission.<br /><br />\ninto the reading of a poem or<br />\nnovel. Grades don't seem to be<br />\nthe major concern of students in<br />\nEnglish, he noted with<br />\nsatisfaction.<br />\nTheological Patterns<br />\n\"Finding secularized versions<br />\nof theological patterns in<br />\nliterature\" is one of Ira Clark's<br />\ncreative reading perspectives and<br />\nhe tries to encourage his students<br />\nto invent their own frameworks.<br />\n\"A student who feeds back the<br />\nprofessor's opinions in his papers<br />\nmay be doing it because he<br />\nthinks that's what the teacher<br />\nwants, or he may be insecure,\"<br />\nClark speculated.

In the<br />\nfirst place, the proposal was submitted by an<br />\nundergraduate, and its main thrust was reportedly<br />\naccepted enthusiastically by the faculty members on<br />\nthe committee. The consideration of changes in the<br />\nundergraduate academic program that might actually<br />\ntake place is heartening, and undergraduates will be<br />\njustified in looking for improvements in their academic<br />\nlot. They will even become aware that there is a long<br />\nestablished committee that has only ,recently begun<br />\nworking for changes in under graduate education rather<br />\nthan the more banal machinations concerning<br />\ngraduation requirements.<br />\nThis particular resolution, although it echoes these<br />\nsentiments for change, is involved with other related<br />\nissues, such as professorial teaching load and the whole<br />\ncredit system. it is too soon to tell just what the<br />\nproposal will be like in its final form. It still has to<br />\nundergo revision in the Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies before the Academic Council looks at it to<br />\nmake their own amendments.

She removed the roses and the dahlias<br />\nfrom the window display and transferred them to<br />\nthe refrigerator, pausing to make sure that the temperature was correctly set. With deft fingers she<br />\ngathered up the unused asparagus fern and arranged it in a soft air-filled pyramid, to be used<br />\ntomorrow. Making a circle of efficiency about the<br />\nshop, she picked up loose bits of florist's tape, wire<br />\n, leaves, stray petals, and the day's debris left by<br />\nthoughtless customers\u2014 cigarette butts, half-written<br />\nand discarded greeting cards\u2014 and relegated what<br />\ncould be salvaged to various nooks and drawers,<br />\nthrowing out what could not. In a last look about<br />\nthe shop, Ruth remembered to make a mental note<br />\nof tomorrow's special orders: a baseball arrangement for a small boy hospitalized with a broken<br />\nleg, an expensive orchid arrangement for a rich,<br />\ncancerous old lady. Then, going to the refrigerator,<br />\nher hand trembling ever so slightly, she carefully<br />\nchose an armful of her freshest spring flowers.<br />\nLeaving, Ruth's lips<br />\ntightened into a little frown that was customary,<br />\nbut that had rooted there so slowly and insidiously<br />\nover the years that she herself was barely aware of<br />\nit. At thirty-five, she knew that she was not an<br />\nextraordinary woman, but she prided herself on<br />\nher principles and on her dignity: she possessed<br />\nmuch of both. Of desire, she admitted nothing<br />\nmore than her desire to excel in her work; of impulses, she had only been 6ducated to ignore them;<br />\nof passion, she was ignorant. She realized that the<br />\nYears of fending for herself had taken their toll and<br />\n\u2022 that she had become settled in her little ways.<br />\nLong ago, she had tried to adjust to certain resignations that she felt she must make: Ruth knew<br />\nthat she was mousy and that her clothes of dull<br />\nblues and greys were not eye- catching, but she<br />\nwould have been embarrassed to appear in the vibrant reds and golds of her flowers. She had tried<br />\nto accept her chin, which she hated, and thought<br />\n*'<br />\ntoo small, and to accept living alone. Lately, more<br />\nOften than usual, it had begun to bother her that<br />\nshe was quickly slipping past the child-bearing<br />\nYears, but when this fear tried to surface in her, she<br />\nwould immediately bury herself in her flowers, and<br />\nthere she could find enough of contentment to sustain herself.<br />\nFor if there had been<br />\nthere<br />\nhad<br />\nalso been successes.<br />\ndisappointments,<br />\nThere was her shop. While it was not large or unusual, it did a brisk business, and Ruth felt that she<br />\nbrought something of art as well as competence to<br />\nher , Located on the ground floor of a sprawling metropolitan hospital, the shop received most of<br />\nthe business that the hospital's clientele brought in,<br />\nin addition to some external business earned by the<br />\nexcellent, if quiet, reputation that Ruth had gained<br />\nin the city. Then, too, she had made friends: Ruth<br />\nfrequently had coffee with the nurses. Secretly, she<br />\nthought some of them a little immoral: she knew<br />\nthat several of the unmarried ones had relationships with men. They kept coaxing her into letting<br />\nthem arrange a date for her with a man, but she<br />\nalways declined, knowing her chin was awful,<br />\ndreading not knowing what to say. \"Ruthie,\" they<br />\nwould tease, \"don't be such an old maid.\"\"Hush\"<br />\nshe always answered, \"ask one of the younger<br />\ngirls,\" and she would try to conceal her lonliness<br />\nfor a man and the certainty that she would be<br />\nrejected with an unsuccessful laugh that soured in<br /><br />\ni. ....,.<br /><br />\ni\u2022-,.-;,;.:.:71\u2018,..<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\ng ,..\u2018'....\u2022 ....:t.,.,<br /><br />\n.\u2022<br />\n'<br />\n4 T<br />\n:n \u2022i<br />\n'VI\"'<br />\n'<br /><br />\n..\u2022 I<br />\nillt\u2022'...6,<br /><br />\n\u20221;..-0I<br />\n\u2022\u2014<br /><br />\n,.....<br /><br />\n\u2022.... ,<br />\n..'<br />\n4tk<br />\n:.%:.<br />\n...,': *<br />\n.,.<br /><br />\n,.......,,<br />\n2,2 \u201e.\u2018 .,...<br />\n..t.<br /><br />\n. z.<br /><br />\n---:\".<br />\n,<br />\n,ti\u2018<br />\n\\,\u0300<br />\n1'!:* 11<br />\n.....\"4111v,:e \\\\<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\n'\u2018\u2018O<br /><br />\n,<br />\nzik3:4,44041... \\<br /><br />\noh\\%<br />\ni\"k\\\u2018<br />\n.kf<br />\nt.,04t41<br />\n41'<br /><br />\nher throat like a lie.<br /><br />\nwere her art.

I<br />\nremember viewing the local news last<br />\nyear the night the last president had<br />\nresigned. They had interviews with<br />\ntypical students in front of the dorms;<br />\nand you could see the lacrosse balls<br />\nwhizzing in the background.) A<br />\ncontingent from the band was torturing<br />\nsome Ta-da-de-dum type song,<br />\npunctuated by beats on a big drum with<br />\nthe University seal on it. Dr. Muller was<br />\nthere, clearing his voice, getting ready to<br />\nmake his speech. It was hardly a<br /><br />\nmuseum<br /><br />\nmomentous occasion. In fact, it was<br />\nverging on the pitiful. So I went on to the<br />\ninfirmary smiling,(or was that wrong??).<br />\nOn the way back, I was the staging of<br />\nthe-anti-war demonstration that had been<br />\nhinted at all week. It was a rather<br />\npleasant affair\u2014staged on the grass near<br />\nthe dorms behind Homewood House,<br />\nthat serene monument to Baltimore's<br />\ngolden days. It was, on the one hand,<br />\nheartening to see the Movement moving<br />\nagain and the .return to the Fifties<br />\npostponed. And on the other hand, it<br />\nseemed so mechanical, almost<br />\nhalf-hearted, as if they had all done this<br />\nso many times before, that they all<br />\ninstinctively knew the right movements.<br />\nIt was during this affair that the<br />\nabsurdity overwhelmed me.<br />\nYou could hear stereos from the dorms<br />\nblasting old Beatles songs out the<br />\nwindows. Guys were running back and<br />\nforth at the rear of the audience, tossing<br />\naround lacrosse balls (so you could know<br />\nit was Johns Hopkins). People were<br />\ncarrying helium-filled balloons as they<br />\nsprawled out on the grass. Some were<br />\neating their lunches. Some were<br />\ncelebrity -watching, picking out<br />\nprominent faculty membets in the crowd.<br />\nDr. Muller (I still remember how angry<br />\nyou were with his statement that the<br />\nPresident's house on campus was not a fit<br />\nplace to bring up his daughters) had<br />\nwalked around from where he had just<br />\nfinished his festival speech and was<br />\nclearing his throat in readiness for his<br />\ndemonstration speech.

Once again the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense held a competent<br />\nOpposition attack unit to a<br />\nmeager five goal output while the<br />\nyoung Hopkins attack again<br />\nproved its superiority against<br />\nsome of the best defensemen in<br />\nthe country.<br />\nBlack Knight defenders Tom<br />\nO'Leary, Bill Heilman, and Tom<br />\nFitzsimmons teamed up to hold<br />\nBlue Jay standout Jack Thomas<br />\nto a mere 2 goals and 3 assists,<br />\nbut Billy Nolan and Don Krohn<br />\ntook up the slack, scoring 3 or 4<br />\ngoals respectively.<br />\nKrohn and Nolan came up<br />\nwith the most demoralizing play<br />\nof the game as soon as action<br />\nresumed following a slashing<br />\npenalty on Thomas six and one<br /><br />\nhalf minutes into the first period.<br />\nHopkins was leading 2-0, but<br />\nArmy had an excellent<br />\nopportunity to cut the lead in<br />\nhalf on this extra man situation.<br />\nInstead, Krohn intercepted the<br />\nArmy clearing pass at midfield<br />\nand found Nolan open for a fast<br />\nbreak. Nolan capitalized with his<br />\nthird goal of the period and the<br />\nCadets never fully recovered.<br />\nA few minutes later Les<br />\nMatthews came up with a<br />\nbeautiful save when Rick<br />\nGoodhand splashed a bounce<br />\nshot at his feet. Army came back<br />\nup the field after O'Leary<br />\nsmothered both Thomas and<br />\nNolan, the Black Knights finally<br />\nscoring as Captain Frank Eich<br />\nbroke free and cut across the<br />\ncrease to convert a Phil Lynch<br />\nfeed.<br />\nDominate<br />\nIn the second quarter Hopkins<br />\ncontinued to dominate all aspects<br />\nof the game, while the Blue Jays<br /><br />\nPat mram and Harry Stringer digfor loose ball in the mud as Rick<br />\nNowalchuk watches.<br /><br />\ndefense held the Cadets to only<br />\nthree shots on goal. Taking as<br />\nmany shots in this period as<br />\nArmy had in the whole first half,<br />\nHopkins pushed the score to 8-1<br />\nbefore the Black Knights could<br />\nscore again.<br />\nThomas netted the sixth Blue<br />\nJay goal in spite of Bill Heilman's<br />\neffective poke-checking to open a<br />\nHopkins barrage of three goals<br />\nwithin two minutes. Forty-seven<br />\nseconds later freshman Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon notched his second<br />\ntally of the spring after coming<br />\nup with the ball in a mud<br />\nsplattered face off tangle. Krohn<br />\nscored the last of the three on<br />\nthe prettiest shot of the<br />\nafternoon, netting a Ken<br />\nWinegrad power play feed in the<br />\nupper left hand corner of the<br />\nArmy goal.<br />\nMidway through the third<br />\nperiod Matthews, who has been<br />\nlooking better each week, made<br />\nhis fifth and best save of the<br />\ngame, coming to the edge of the<br />\ncrease to cut down the angle on<br />\nan open charging Cadet. The<br />\nensuing shot was hard, high and<br />\ngoal-bound, but Les got his stick<br />\nin the way and started a<br />\nsuccessful clear.<br />\nClosing Minutes<br />\nIn the closing minutes of the<br />\nquarter, O'Leary, a sophomore<br />\nand the most impressive<br />\nindividual defenseman Hopkins<br />\nhas seen all season, started a fast<br />\nbreak clear that resulted in Russ<br />\nBolling's third goal of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe game ended with Thomas<br />\ncontinuing his campaign for the<br />\nscoring championship, as he<br />\ncontributed on all three Blue Jay<br />\nfourth quarter goals. First,<br />\nThomas found Mike Perez open<br />\nat the crease, with Mike<br />\nconverting the feed just before<br />\nhis defender recovered. Two<br />\nminutes later, Thomas worked<br />\nO'Leary around the goal, getting<br />\nthe defensive star to slip in the<br />\nmud off the left pipe.
