Cwk*Mr. Mark Rohrlich<br />\nEditor, The News-Letter<br />\n<br />\n41/<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nPeace over Laos?<br />\nThe dubious assumptions of Vietnamization have<br />\nbeen shattered by the invasion of Laos and the vast<br />\nincrease in United States' bombing in the Indochina<br />\nWar. Nixon's non-plan of gradual withdrawal seems<br />\nto have lulled the anti-war movement to sleep. Nixon<br />\nand his Administration believe that because it's cold<br />\noutside, and because he didn't make a dramatic plea<br />\nfor patriotism, thereby opening the floodgates to<br />\nrebuff, Laos will not be another Cambodia--at least.<br />\nnot on the domestic scene. He hopes that come<br />\n,spring --speculation is April--the big Laos thrust will<br />\nthe North Vietnamese supply schedule will have been<br />\nset back dramatically, and he will be able to<br />\nannounce a \"significant withdrawal\" of u.U.S.<br />\ncombat troops--a tried and true domestic pacifier.<br />\nHopefully, the peace forces in this country will<br />\nbrave the cold and make it a little more difficult for<br />\nMr. Nixon to bide his time and further expand the<br />\nwar. Hopefully, they will try to persuade those as yet<br />\nunconverted that what the President is doing may<br />\neventually lead to an American pullout, but it will be<br />\na pullout tainted with the dishonor--the blood of an<br />\neven wider war and one that, because of our<br />\npresence, will surely go on for many years after we<br />\nhave gone.<br />\nThe fact is that if there had been no protests, no<br />\nmarches on Washington, no peace candidates, we<br />\nwould likely be in a far more serious confrontation<br />\nthan we are now.<br />\nThe peace movement has taught a whole<br />\ngeneration to oppose the imperialist basis of United<br />\nStates foreign policy. Still, we are not out of<br />\nIndochina. That should be our main goal, and we are<br />\nfar from achieving it. With the invasion of Laos, the<br />\nanti-war movement has rolled over and played dead.<br />\nWednesday's demonstrations could barely draw a<br />\ncrowd, and the leadership of the anti-war movement<br />\nhas simply not stepped forward. From Fulbright to<br />\nTom Hayden to the Weathermen, there has been, at<br />\nleast in public, a passive acceptance of the Nixon<br />\nescalation.<br />\nSo, it is up to us. Starting from the bottom, like the<br />\noriginal opponents in the early sixties, we have to<br />\nbuild outward from the campuses once again. The<br />\npressure has to come from somewhere and we had<br />\nbetter provide it or be prepared to watch the<br />\nIndochina War become a permanent fixture of<br />\nnational life.<br />\n<br />\nGilman Clock<br />\nFor scores of years, as generations of Hopkins<br />\nstudents stirred restlessly in their classroom seats,<br />\nthe Gilman clock would play its little tune to their<br />\nstraining ears.

One measure, and<br />\neven though they thought the class must surely be<br />\njust about over, only fifteen minutes had elapsed.<br />\nTwo measures, and the suffering was half gone.<br />\nThree measures, and productive activity nearly<br />\nceased as the class would start packing up.<br />\nBut now,a misdirected austerity move has silenced<br />\nthis Homewood mainstay. Professors have no idea of<br />\nthe time and continue their monologue until the<br />\nmonotonous bong stops them and then it is too late to<br />\nmake the next class. It couldn't cost that much to fix<br />\nthis precious tradition, which now stands idle in<br />\ndisrepair, and so we urge that the administration<br />\nmove quickly to get the bells ringing across the<br />\nKeyser guadrangle once again.<br />\n<br />\nDear Ted:<br />\nWho's<br />\nRichard<br />\nArmbruster?<br />\nSincerely,<br />\n(signed) Dick<br />\nRobert Westcott<br />\nPROVERBIAL HORSE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nJim Cleary seems to have<br />\nput the cart before the<br />\nproverbial horse when he<br />\nclaimed in his February 9<br />\ncolumn that since everyone<br />\nnow leaves campus after<br />\nclasses because there is no<br />\nreason to stay, then if a<br />\nunion<br />\nwere<br />\nstudent<br />\nconstructed, still no one<br />\nwould remain.<br />\nA student union is certainly<br />\nno panacea, but it is a step<br />\ntowards sanity in this antisocial environment.<br />\nArsel Benny<br />\nPHYSICS COURSES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis is to inform you that<br />\nthe Physics Department is<br />\nteaching 13 courses this<br />\nsemester, not four as you<br />\nreported in last Friday's<br />\npaper.<br />\nDr. George Owen<br />\nChairman--Physics<br />\n<br />\n4'<br />\ne<br />\ntal<br />\n<br />\n4ty<br />\n<br />\n4)ek41r vot<br />\n\u2022\u201e 41,4,<br />\n\u2022 ,p<br />\n<br />\ntt*<br />\nOlv<br />\n<br />\nr\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\nBIOLOGY COURSES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour February 6 editorial<br />\nis partly erroneous and partly<br />\nmisleading with respect to<br />\nthe undergraduate teaching<br />\nload of the Department of<br />\nBiology.<br />\nWhile you indicate that the<br />\ncatalog \"lists 31 teaching<br />\n<br />\nprofessors in biology,\" seven<br />\nare listed as part- time ...

To a large extent this is true.<br />\nThis is true because the Student Council<br />\ndoes not have enough money in its treasury<br />\nto bring any good entertainment on campus.<br />\nThe way the system works now is that each<br />\nsemester the undergraduates pay $12.50 in<br />\nstudent activities fees $25 a year) which is<br />\nmatched by the administration.<br />\nThis money serves both the classes and the<br />\nStudent Council as their capital. Since there<br />\nare approximately 1,950 undergraduates<br />\nhere, this totals about $97,000 a year.<br />\nThis money finances most student<br />\nactivities. It also finances the entertainment<br />\nthat is brought onto campus.<br />\nIt should be clear that there is not too<br />\nmuch money for the latter activity. Not only<br />\nthat, but the fund must make up any debts<br />\nmade by the previous year's expenditures.<br />\nThis results in the presence of a threat<br />\nwhenever a group is brought on campus: it<br />\nmight lose money.<br />\nThis threat is very real and apparent to<br />\nanyone who has worked with the Student<br />\nCouncil. No band that costs a large amount<br />\nof money can be brought in since about $5,000<br />\nor $6,000 is all the Council can allocate for<br />\nany event. (This is a very liberal estimate.)<br />\nThe Council sells tickets to help finance the<br />\n'B' entertainment it has, and always falls<br />\nshort of its goals. This has meant it loses<br />\nmoney whenever it sponsors a band. This<br />\nloss is paid out of the student activity fund<br />\nwhich is too low anyway. And thus cycle<br />\nbegins.<br />\nLast year the Student Council inherited a<br />\nKen Bronstein is a -Hopkins \u2022 junior. -<br />\n<br />\ndebt that was so large that it could hardly<br />\nfinance any entertainment for that year.<br />\nThis was caused by the Council of two years<br />\nago which sponsored a lot of entertainment.<br />\nThe solution to the problem is obvious.<br />\nThe activity fee must be raised. I propose<br />\nthat the activity fee for each student here<br />\n(graduate and undergraduate) be raised by<br />\n$25.<br />\nThe increase would be used only to bring<br />\nquality entertainment to Hopkins. The<br />\nincrease would yield about $80,750. With the<br />\nmoney already allotted by the present fee for<br />\nentertainment, this would give about<br />\n$100,000 for entertainment. (Plus gate<br />\nreceipts from non-students would increase<br />\nthe fund).<br />\nThis increase would entitle the student to<br />\nget into any entertainment free brought here<br />\nby the fee.<br />\nHe would also be entitled to bring a date or<br />\nhis wife for free. (Non-students, though,<br />\nwould pay.) This money could be used to<br />\nsponsor movies and bands of quality without<br />\nfear of loss of funds. This could, for instance,<br />\nprovide for seven groups--each of which<br />\nc,harge $10,000--and a host of classic movies.<br />\nTo make sure that there is a program that<br />\nis worth this investment, a committee of<br />\nstudents, rather than one student as is the<br />\ncase now, should decide what the<br />\nentertainment will be, or the students could<br />\nvote on the programs.<br />\nFinally, if the additional $25 is too high, a<br />\nsmaller amount could be added. However,<br />\nthe student body would save money since<br />\nthey would not have to buy tickets to the<br />\nrather expensive entertainment that is<br />\noffered in Baltimore. The plan is not perfect,<br />\n'but it does offer an alternative to the present<br />\nsystem that does not work.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\na\u2022<br />\n<br />\n(1)<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.1<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n-4<br />\n<br />\nra\u2022\u2022\u2022\u202211014<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n000<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4*.<br />\n<br />\nWITHOUT<br />\nREALLY<br />\nTRYING<br />\n<br />\nre.1.<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n10/18<br />\n<br />\nMGM OTOKIIST P1ODUCTS PROViDI ITS 'ago RAO<br />\nIMIt\u2022 In firms! or .toos AND CiatAISS 1211 i/S1D<br />\n<br />\nedge./a,,Ae uirgestins93<br />\n1111111 4111111111/111111~i<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nPabat<br />\nBlue Ribbon<br />\nBEER<br />\n<br />\n111111111111111E<br />\n<br />\ntr.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nDAB<br />\nA\".......%.\\<br />\n\\ PAF1ST BREWING COMPANY.

Melvin's own feelings<br />\nabout the drug were at first<br />\nshaped mostly by the films he<br />\nsaw in health class, and so he<br />\nfirmly believed that one<br />\n\"drag\" on a \"reefer\" would<br />\nCause him to foam at the<br />\nmouth and molest little girls.<br />\nBut a few of the hip avantgarde in his school were<br />\nalready using the drug, and<br />\nMelvin would try to impress<br />\nthem<br />\nhis suave<br />\nwith<br />\nknowledge of the intricacies<br />\nof the narcotic underworld.<br />\n\"Hey Daddy-o,\" Melvin<br />\nOften said, \"got any Mary<br />\nJane?\"<br />\n.

Also, he wanted<br />\nto get laid.<br />\nMarijuana could be his<br />\nglorious introduction to the<br />\nmystic world of the New<br />\nMorality, where languid,<br />\ndark-haired beauties lounged<br />\naround in chic pads, sipping<br />\nexpresso and sharing deeply<br />\nfelt thoughts about Man's<br />\nDilemma. It could all be his:<br />\nVillage,<br />\nGreenwich<br />\nmuseums, poetry, concerts,<br />\nand<br />\nmarches,<br />\nprotest<br />\nscrewing. Melvin sighed at<br />\nthe mere thought of it.<br />\nWhen the opportunity<br />\ncame, then, for Melvin to<br />\nactually go to an elaborate,<br />\nrigidly formal ceremony<br />\nknown as a \"pot party,\" he<br />\nseized it eagerly. In those<br />\ndays, pot parties were as<br />\nenormous an undertaking as<br />\na meeting of a Resistance cell<br />\nin occupied France. Kids<br />\nwandered around the halls<br />\ngiving each other secret<br />\nsignals and whispering<br />\nconspiratorially, \"Got the<br />\nstuff?\"<br />\nWhen the day actually<br />\narrived for his initiation into<br />\nthe rites of the marijuana<br />\nMelvin<br />\nunderworld,<br />\nstudiously avoided reading<br />\nold Henry J.

In their relaxed<br />\nhis host fifteen minutes to<br />\npositions, they looked just<br />\nopen the door.

But Melvin<br />\ncould not be dissuaded from<br />\nhis belief that the house was<br />\nthe constant target of<br />\nsurveillance by the police,<br />\niter'<br />\nFBI, and Army.

He was gripped<br />\nby doubt now, and peering<br />\nthrough the haze, he<br />\nwondered whether they<br />\nsay<br />\nmust<br />\nwere...we<br />\nit...degenerates. He might be<br />\nentering the grim world of<br />\nfixes and cold turkey.<br />\nBut Melvin went ahead<br />\nanyway, eager to turn on.<br />\n\"Can I have some puffs?\"<br />\nMelvin asked, and he<br />\nwatched carefully as David<br />\ndemonstrated the sacred<br />\nmethod. David's face got red,<br />\ntears streamed down his face,<br />\nand in every .respect he<br />\nlooked as if he was having an<br />\nepileptic fit. Finally, David<br />\nexhaled, and panting wildly,<br />\nhanded the glowing pipe to<br />\nMelvin. \"Take it all the way<br />\nin, and hold it in your lungs as<br />\nlong as you can,- he said,<br />\nwith a gravity befitting the<br />\nsolemn occasion.<br />\nThe pipe, unfortunately,<br />\n.went out by the time it<br />\nreached Melvin's sweaty<br />\nhands and David re-lit it for<br />\nhim as Melvin puffed madly.<br />\nAt last, the marijuana burst<br />\ninto Melvin's throat-with the<br />\nintensity of a blowtorch.<br />\nMelvin coughed and gagged,<br />\nswooning the floor, where he<br />\nlay scratching at his throat<br />\nand picking marijuana<br />\n(ContinuCd on page 9)<br />\n<br />\nConservation<br />\n<br />\nThe Tragedy of Assateague<br />\nPhilip Hartman<br />\nTo the Algonquin Indians<br />\nAssateaque meant \"a long<br />\nbrownish yellow river of sand<br />\nacross the water.\" So this<br />\n'stretch of low, fragile barrier<br />\nreef off the coasts of<br />\nMaryland and Virginia<br />\nremains today.

The famous Keepsake certificate provides<br />\npermanent registration, trade-in<br />\nvalue and protection against loss<br />\nof diamonds from the setting.<br />\nCOLOR: Fine white diamonds are<br />\nquite rare and valued accordingly.<br />\nOther shades in relative order of<br />\ntheir worth are: blue, yellow,<br />\nbrown and black.<br />\nCUT: The cut of a diamond\u2014the<br />\nfacets placed on it by a trained<br />\ncutter\u2014brings out the gem's fire<br />\nand brilliance. Anything less than<br />\ncorrect cut reduces beauty, brilliance and value.<br />\nCLARITY: Determined by the absence of small impurities. A perfect diamond has no impurities<br />\nwhen examined under ten power<br />\nmagnification by a trained eye.<br />\nCARAT: A diamond's size is<br />\nmeasured in carats. As a diamond<br />\nincreases in size, its price will<br />\nincrease even more if the quality<br />\nremains constant.

The kids<br />\nrollerskatilig past the shop pause to<br />\nlean in the door and yell \"Hiya Nick!<br />\nHey Papa Nick.\" He might as well<br />\nnot have a last name.<br />\n****<br />\nWhen Nick was 15, he came to<br />\nAmerica, shovelling coal aboard the<br />\nsteamer from his native Greece. He<br />\ncould not speak English and he had<br />\nno education to speak of (\"1 gotta<br />\nyear in kindygarden and a halfa<br />\nyear school.\"). But he has always<br />\nstayed healthy and he loves to work.<br />\n\"Th' only time I get tired'n'sick is<br />\nwhen I don' hava no business.\"<br />\nBy the start of the Second World<br />\nWar, Nick had worked his way from<br />\nhis first job as a dishwasher to<br />\nowning a successful restaurant in<br />\nEssex, Maryland. After the war, he<br />\nleft Essex to open his shop on<br />\nGreenmount Avenue He recalls that<br /><br />\nthe neighborhood was growing and<br />\nprospering--\"Lotsa people inna<br />\nstreet--plenny business.\"<br />\nAfter a quarter-century, the<br />\ndeclined<br />\nhas<br />\nneighborhood<br />\nsomewhat, but Nick, at 66, is as<br />\nactive as he was when he came to<br />\nthis country. In twenty-six years, he<br />\nhas taken four days off--two Easter<br />\nSundays and two Christmas days.<br />\nDuring the time, he has never been<br />\nsick, and he prizes his health above<br />\nany amount of money. \"Whassa<br />\ngood to buy a beautiful steak an' you<br />\ncanna eat it?\"<br />\nBut the decline in business bothers<br />\nNick at times, He is only content<br />\nwhen he has customers to feed and<br />\nplenty to do. The last few years have<br />\nbeen particularly bad, and traffic in<br />\nthe restaurant is slower than ever<br /><br />\nThe decrease in the number of<br />\nstudents visiting Nick's is partially<br />\nexplained by the expansion of<br />\n\"chain-store\" operations such as<br />\nHarley's, Harry Little's and Gino's.<br />\nNick cannot see why anyone would<br />\nvisit one of these stores in<br />\npreference to his. \"Harley'sa sellin'<br />\none kinda sub--I can givit more,\" he<br />\nsays, and the variety of his<br />\nofferings is truly striking.

Greek Specials,<br />\nsubs, spaghetti and platters are all<br />\nmade to order.<br />\nClearly, Nick has been out-hyped.<br />\nHe doesn't have the money to<br />\nadvertise. His patrons don't sit in<br />\nchrome and plate glass luxury.<br />\nBut those who have met him know<br />\nthat he wouldn't affect that type of<br />\nersatz splendor even if he could. His<br />\nshop looks like it hasn't changed for<br />\nten, maybe twenty years. The<br />\nwooden booths have a new coat of<br />\npaint, a television (which nobody<br />\nwatches) is on continually, and the<br />\nlists which cover the walls have new<br />\nprices pasted over the old. But these<br />\nconcessions to the passage of time<br />\ndon't dispel the feelings of<br />\npermanence and antiquity which the<br />\nshop evokes.<br />\nTwenty-six years of frying with<br />\nolive oil has given a yellow cast to<br />\nthe overhead lights. Fading pictures<br />\nof the last supper and the madonna<br />\nand child are juxtaposed with early<br />\n'fifties pin-ups from which the<br />\ncalendars have long since fallen.<br />\nAnd high on the back wall is a small<br />\nsign almost hidden by the newer<br />\nprice lists--\"ICE CREAM SODAS<br />\n15\u00a2.\"<br />\nNick remembers well the days<br />\nwhen sodas were 15\u00a2 and when he<br />\noffered three backfin crab cakes for<br />\n25\u00a2. It makes him sad to think that<br />\nthose prices may never be seen<br />\nagain.

Cwk*Mr. Mark Rohrlich<br />\nEditor, The News-Letter<br /><br />\n41/<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nPeace over Laos?<br />\nThe dubious assumptions of Vietnamization have<br />\nbeen shattered by the invasion of Laos and the vast<br />\nincrease in United States' bombing in the Indochina<br />\nWar. Nixon's non-plan of gradual withdrawal seems<br />\nto have lulled the anti-war movement to sleep. Nixon<br />\nand his Administration believe that because it's cold<br />\noutside, and because he didn't make a dramatic plea<br />\nfor patriotism, thereby opening the floodgates to<br />\nrebuff, Laos will not be another Cambodia--at least.<br />\nnot on the domestic scene. He hopes that come<br />\n,spring --speculation is April--the big Laos thrust will<br />\nthe North Vietnamese supply schedule will have been<br />\nset back dramatically, and he will be able to<br />\nannounce a \"significant withdrawal\" of u.U.S.<br />\ncombat troops--a tried and true domestic pacifier.<br />\nHopefully, the peace forces in this country will<br />\nbrave the cold and make it a little more difficult for<br />\nMr. Nixon to bide his time and further expand the<br />\nwar. Hopefully, they will try to persuade those as yet<br />\nunconverted that what the President is doing may<br />\neventually lead to an American pullout, but it will be<br />\na pullout tainted with the dishonor--the blood of an<br />\neven wider war and one that, because of our<br />\npresence, will surely go on for many years after we<br />\nhave gone.<br />\nThe fact is that if there had been no protests, no<br />\nmarches on Washington, no peace candidates, we<br />\nwould likely be in a far more serious confrontation<br />\nthan we are now.<br />\nThe peace movement has taught a whole<br />\ngeneration to oppose the imperialist basis of United<br />\nStates foreign policy. Still, we are not out of<br />\nIndochina. That should be our main goal, and we are<br />\nfar from achieving it. With the invasion of Laos, the<br />\nanti-war movement has rolled over and played dead.<br />\nWednesday's demonstrations could barely draw a<br />\ncrowd, and the leadership of the anti-war movement<br />\nhas simply not stepped forward. From Fulbright to<br />\nTom Hayden to the Weathermen, there has been, at<br />\nleast in public, a passive acceptance of the Nixon<br />\nescalation.<br />\nSo, it is up to us. Starting from the bottom, like the<br />\noriginal opponents in the early sixties, we have to<br />\nbuild outward from the campuses once again. The<br />\npressure has to come from somewhere and we had<br />\nbetter provide it or be prepared to watch the<br />\nIndochina War become a permanent fixture of<br />\nnational life.<br /><br />\nGilman Clock<br />\nFor scores of years, as generations of Hopkins<br />\nstudents stirred restlessly in their classroom seats,<br />\nthe Gilman clock would play its little tune to their<br />\nstraining ears. Pencils would stop scratching against<br />\nnotebooks as the students would count the number of<br />\nmeasures that the clock rang out. One measure, and<br />\neven though they thought the class must surely be<br />\njust about over, only fifteen minutes had elapsed.<br />\nTwo measures, and the suffering was half gone.<br />\nThree measures, and productive activity nearly<br />\nceased as the class would start packing up.<br />\nBut now,a misdirected austerity move has silenced<br />\nthis Homewood mainstay. Professors have no idea of<br />\nthe time and continue their monologue until the<br />\nmonotonous bong stops them and then it is too late to<br />\nmake the next class. It couldn't cost that much to fix<br />\nthis precious tradition, which now stands idle in<br />\ndisrepair, and so we urge that the administration<br />\nmove quickly to get the bells ringing across the<br />\nKeyser guadrangle once again.<br /><br />\nDear Ted:<br />\nWho's<br />\nRichard<br />\nArmbruster?<br />\nSincerely,<br />\n(signed) Dick<br />\nRobert Westcott<br />\nPROVERBIAL HORSE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nJim Cleary seems to have<br />\nput the cart before the<br />\nproverbial horse when he<br />\nclaimed in his February 9<br />\ncolumn that since everyone<br />\nnow leaves campus after<br />\nclasses because there is no<br />\nreason to stay, then if a<br />\nunion<br />\nwere<br />\nstudent<br />\nconstructed, still no one<br />\nwould remain.<br />\nA student union is certainly<br />\nno panacea, but it is a step<br />\ntowards sanity in this antisocial environment.<br />\nArsel Benny<br />\nPHYSICS COURSES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis is to inform you that<br />\nthe Physics Department is<br />\nteaching 13 courses this<br />\nsemester, not four as you<br />\nreported in last Friday's<br />\npaper.<br />\nDr. George Owen<br />\nChairman--Physics<br /><br />\n4'<br />\ne<br />\ntal<br /><br />\n4ty<br /><br />\n4)ek41r vot<br />\n\u2022\u201e 41,4,<br />\n\u2022 ,p<br /><br />\ntt*<br />\nOlv<br /><br />\nr\u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\nBIOLOGY COURSES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour February 6 editorial<br />\nis partly erroneous and partly<br />\nmisleading with respect to<br />\nthe undergraduate teaching<br />\nload of the Department of<br />\nBiology.<br />\nWhile you indicate that the<br />\ncatalog \"lists 31 teaching<br /><br />\nprofessors in biology,\" seven<br />\nare listed as part- time ...

To a large extent this is true.<br />\nThis is true because the Student Council<br />\ndoes not have enough money in its treasury<br />\nto bring any good entertainment on campus.<br />\nThe way the system works now is that each<br />\nsemester the undergraduates pay $12.50 in<br />\nstudent activities fees $25 a year) which is<br />\nmatched by the administration.<br />\nThis money serves both the classes and the<br />\nStudent Council as their capital. Since there<br />\nare approximately 1,950 undergraduates<br />\nhere, this totals about $97,000 a year.<br />\nThis money finances most student<br />\nactivities. It also finances the entertainment<br />\nthat is brought onto campus.<br />\nIt should be clear that there is not too<br />\nmuch money for the latter activity. Not only<br />\nthat, but the fund must make up any debts<br />\nmade by the previous year's expenditures.<br />\nThis results in the presence of a threat<br />\nwhenever a group is brought on campus: it<br />\nmight lose money.<br />\nThis threat is very real and apparent to<br />\nanyone who has worked with the Student<br />\nCouncil. No band that costs a large amount<br />\nof money can be brought in since about $5,000<br />\nor $6,000 is all the Council can allocate for<br />\nany event. (This is a very liberal estimate.)<br />\nThe Council sells tickets to help finance the<br />\n'B' entertainment it has, and always falls<br />\nshort of its goals. This has meant it loses<br />\nmoney whenever it sponsors a band. This<br />\nloss is paid out of the student activity fund<br />\nwhich is too low anyway. And thus cycle<br />\nbegins.<br />\nLast year the Student Council inherited a<br />\nKen Bronstein is a -Hopkins \u2022 junior. -<br /><br />\ndebt that was so large that it could hardly<br />\nfinance any entertainment for that year.<br />\nThis was caused by the Council of two years<br />\nago which sponsored a lot of entertainment.<br />\nThe solution to the problem is obvious.<br />\nThe activity fee must be raised. I propose<br />\nthat the activity fee for each student here<br />\n(graduate and undergraduate) be raised by<br />\n$25.<br />\nThe increase would be used only to bring<br />\nquality entertainment to Hopkins. The<br />\nincrease would yield about $80,750. With the<br />\nmoney already allotted by the present fee for<br />\nentertainment, this would give about<br />\n$100,000 for entertainment. (Plus gate<br />\nreceipts from non-students would increase<br />\nthe fund).<br />\nThis increase would entitle the student to<br />\nget into any entertainment free brought here<br />\nby the fee.<br />\nHe would also be entitled to bring a date or<br />\nhis wife for free. (Non-students, though,<br />\nwould pay.) This money could be used to<br />\nsponsor movies and bands of quality without<br />\nfear of loss of funds. This could, for instance,<br />\nprovide for seven groups--each of which<br />\nc,harge $10,000--and a host of classic movies.<br />\nTo make sure that there is a program that<br />\nis worth this investment, a committee of<br />\nstudents, rather than one student as is the<br />\ncase now, should decide what the<br />\nentertainment will be, or the students could<br />\nvote on the programs.<br />\nFinally, if the additional $25 is too high, a<br />\nsmaller amount could be added. However,<br />\nthe student body would save money since<br />\nthey would not have to buy tickets to the<br />\nrather expensive entertainment that is<br />\noffered in Baltimore. The plan is not perfect,<br />\n'but it does offer an alternative to the present<br />\nsystem that does not work.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\na\u2022<br /><br />\n(1)<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n.1<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n-4<br /><br />\nra\u2022\u2022\u2022\u202211014<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n000<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n4*.<br /><br />\nWITHOUT<br />\nREALLY<br />\nTRYING<br /><br />\nre.1.<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\n10/18<br /><br />\nMGM OTOKIIST P1ODUCTS PROViDI ITS 'ago RAO<br />\nIMIt\u2022 In firms! or .toos AND CiatAISS 1211 i/S1D<br /><br />\nedge./a,,Ae uirgestins93<br />\n1111111 4111111111/111111~i<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nPabat<br />\nBlue Ribbon<br />\nBEER<br /><br />\n111111111111111E<br /><br />\ntr.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nDAB<br />\nA\".......%.\\<br />\n\\ PAF1ST BREWING COMPANY.

Melvin's own feelings<br />\nabout the drug were at first<br />\nshaped mostly by the films he<br />\nsaw in health class, and so he<br />\nfirmly believed that one<br />\n\"drag\" on a \"reefer\" would<br />\nCause him to foam at the<br />\nmouth and molest little girls.<br />\nBut a few of the hip avantgarde in his school were<br />\nalready using the drug, and<br />\nMelvin would try to impress<br />\nthem<br />\nhis suave<br />\nwith<br />\nknowledge of the intricacies<br />\nof the narcotic underworld.<br />\n\"Hey Daddy-o,\" Melvin<br />\nOften said, \"got any Mary<br />\nJane?\"<br />\n. Soon, however, Melvin read<br />\nin Time Magazine of beatniks<br />\nand hippies, and he wanted to<br />\nbe part of the consciousnessexpanding search for new<br />\ntruths, he yearned to share in<br /><br />\nthe communal grooviness of<br />\nWhat's Happening, he longed<br />\nto be part of the profound<br />\nidealism of the young<br />\ngeneration. Also, he wanted<br />\nto get laid.<br />\nMarijuana could be his<br />\nglorious introduction to the<br />\nmystic world of the New<br />\nMorality, where languid,<br />\ndark-haired beauties lounged<br />\naround in chic pads, sipping<br />\nexpresso and sharing deeply<br />\nfelt thoughts about Man's<br />\nDilemma. It could all be his:<br />\nVillage,<br />\nGreenwich<br />\nmuseums, poetry, concerts,<br />\nand<br />\nmarches,<br />\nprotest<br />\nscrewing. Melvin sighed at<br />\nthe mere thought of it.<br />\nWhen the opportunity<br />\ncame, then, for Melvin to<br />\nactually go to an elaborate,<br />\nrigidly formal ceremony<br />\nknown as a \"pot party,\" he<br />\nseized it eagerly. In those<br />\ndays, pot parties were as<br />\nenormous an undertaking as<br />\na meeting of a Resistance cell<br />\nin occupied France. Kids<br />\nwandered around the halls<br />\ngiving each other secret<br />\nsignals and whispering<br />\nconspiratorially, \"Got the<br />\nstuff?\"<br />\nWhen the day actually<br />\narrived for his initiation into<br />\nthe rites of the marijuana<br />\nMelvin<br />\nunderworld,<br />\nstudiously avoided reading<br />\nold Henry J.

But Melvin<br />\ncould not be dissuaded from<br />\nhis belief that the house was<br />\nthe constant target of<br />\nsurveillance by the police,<br />\niter'<br />\nFBI, and Army.

He might be<br />\nentering the grim world of<br />\nfixes and cold turkey.<br />\nBut Melvin went ahead<br />\nanyway, eager to turn on.<br />\n\"Can I have some puffs?\"<br />\nMelvin asked, and he<br />\nwatched carefully as David<br />\ndemonstrated the sacred<br />\nmethod. David's face got red,<br />\ntears streamed down his face,<br />\nand in every .respect he<br />\nlooked as if he was having an<br />\nepileptic fit. Finally, David<br />\nexhaled, and panting wildly,<br />\nhanded the glowing pipe to<br />\nMelvin. \"Take it all the way<br />\nin, and hold it in your lungs as<br />\nlong as you can,- he said,<br />\nwith a gravity befitting the<br />\nsolemn occasion.<br />\nThe pipe, unfortunately,<br />\n.went out by the time it<br />\nreached Melvin's sweaty<br />\nhands and David re-lit it for<br />\nhim as Melvin puffed madly.<br />\nAt last, the marijuana burst<br />\ninto Melvin's throat-with the<br />\nintensity of a blowtorch.<br />\nMelvin coughed and gagged,<br />\nswooning the floor, where he<br />\nlay scratching at his throat<br />\nand picking marijuana<br />\n(ContinuCd on page 9)<br /><br />\nConservation<br /><br />\nThe Tragedy of Assateague<br />\nPhilip Hartman<br />\nTo the Algonquin Indians<br />\nAssateaque meant \"a long<br />\nbrownish yellow river of sand<br />\nacross the water.\" So this<br />\n'stretch of low, fragile barrier<br />\nreef off the coasts of<br />\nMaryland and Virginia<br />\nremains today.

The famous Keepsake certificate provides<br />\npermanent registration, trade-in<br />\nvalue and protection against loss<br />\nof diamonds from the setting.<br />\nCOLOR: Fine white diamonds are<br />\nquite rare and valued accordingly.<br />\nOther shades in relative order of<br />\ntheir worth are: blue, yellow,<br />\nbrown and black.<br />\nCUT: The cut of a diamond\u2014the<br />\nfacets placed on it by a trained<br />\ncutter\u2014brings out the gem's fire<br />\nand brilliance. Anything less than<br />\ncorrect cut reduces beauty, brilliance and value.<br />\nCLARITY: Determined by the absence of small impurities. A perfect diamond has no impurities<br />\nwhen examined under ten power<br />\nmagnification by a trained eye.<br />\nCARAT: A diamond's size is<br />\nmeasured in carats. As a diamond<br />\nincreases in size, its price will<br />\nincrease even more if the quality<br />\nremains constant.
