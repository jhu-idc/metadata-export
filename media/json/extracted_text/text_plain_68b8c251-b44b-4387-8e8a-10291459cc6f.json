Part of the boot covers<br />\na front tire hubcap; a metal arm extends from<br />\nthis cover to cross in front of the tire and attach to its inside.<br />\n\"Any attempt to move the car will render<br />\ndamange,\" said Fred Raynor, a Transit and<br />\nTraffic spokesman.<br />\nTo have the boot removed, the owner of the<br />\ncar has to go to the Parking Fines Division in<br />\nthe Municipal Building downtown.

The boot fee is<br />\ndropped if the vehicle is towed, but a $27 towing charge is then added to the amount owed<br />\nfor the parking tickets.<br />\nBegun on March 15, the boot has been used<br />\non 60 or 70 cars throughout the city and has<br />\nproven \"more effective than towing,\" Raynor<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThe boot method is also easier and cheaper<br />\nthan towing, Raynor added, and there is a<br />\nsmaller chance of damage to the car.<br />\nThe response from owners of booted cars<br />\nthus far has been \"surprised more than anything,\" Raynor said.<br />\n<br />\nThe new \"Flex-Med' program at Hopkins' medical<br />\nschool will attempt to relieve<br />\nstudents from \"pre-med pressures,\" said the program's<br />\ncoordinator, Assistant Dean of<br />\nAdmissions of the Medical<br />\nSchool Norman Anderson.<br />\nOne of the program's several<br />\noptions is to allow accepted<br />\ngraduating seniors up to three<br />\nyears delay before entering<br />\ngraduate medical school.

Thus, they will be<br />\nable to complete their education<br />\nfor a baccalaureate degree<br />\n\"Free from pre-med pressures,\"<br />\nAnderson said.<br />\nThese students can \"pursue<br />\nquality learning experiences\"<br />\nby coming to the med school<br />\nfor summer classes or \"minimesters.\"<br />\nAccepted juniors will be expeeled to maintain a gradepoint average necessary to ohtam n a baccalaureate degree.<br />\n\"We fully expect the students<br />\nto have a lower GPA after acceptance,\" Anderson said, but<br />\nthe school is more interested in<br />\nmaking available the med<br />\nschool learning experience.<br />\nAnother option allows accepted juniors to go to another<br />\naccredited college for a senior<br />\n<br />\nCouncil Approves New Activities Budget<br />\nBY FIFHAN RARICK<br />\nWithout making any changes<br />\nWednesday night, the Student<br />\nCouncil approved the budget of<br />\nthe Student Activities Commission for next year. On Tuesday,<br />\nthe entire SAC had approved<br />\nthe budget, 13ut only after making some changes in the.original<br />\nbudget proposed by the SAC<br />\nExecutive Board.<br />\nThe budget passed by the<br />\ncouncil, which is therefore the<br />\nfinal budget of the SAC, provides for outlays of $99,975 for<br />\nstudent activities during the<br />\nnext academic year. In addition, the budget provides for a<br />\ncontingency fund of $13,445.<br />\nSAC groups may, throughout<br />\nthe course of the year, ask the<br />\nSAC Executive Board to give<br />\nthem money from this contingency fund to pay for un-<br />\n<br />\nforeseen expenses. The total<br />\nbudget of the SAC, therefore,<br />\nis $113,420. This amount, which<br />\nwas alloted to the SAC by the<br />\nadministration, is a 7 percent<br />\n-increase from 'last year.<br />\nMost notably, this budget<br />\neliminates all funding for the<br />\nStudent Council Speaker Committee. Under the budget proposed by the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard, this committee had been<br />\ngiven $10(X). On the floor of the<br />\nSAC, however, Jim Salles proposed an amendment, which<br />\npassed, eliminating all funding<br />\nFor this committee.<br />\nWednesday night, several<br />\ncouncil members objected to<br />\nthis cut. Junior Class Representative and Student Council<br />\nVice-President-Elect Dolores<br />\nBulleri abstained on the passage<br />\nof the budget. The only council member not to vote for<br />\n<br />\nHarry Davis<br />\n<br />\npassage, Bulleri said she abstained because she did not like<br />\nthe cuts made to the Speaker<br />\nCommittee. Council Treasurer<br />\nHarry Davis also complained of<br />\nthe cut, and said that he would<br />\nlike to see \"structural changes\"<br />\nwhich would protect Student<br />\n<br />\nCouncil committees from \"political maneuvering.\" Saying he<br />\nwould pursue these changes<br />\nnext fall, Davis said he felt the<br />\nbest method would be to make<br />\nit more difficult to amend the<br />\nbudget on the floor of the SAC.<br />\nAt the SAC meeting on Tuesday, there had been an attempt<br />\nby several SAC groups to discard the Executive Board's<br />\nbudget, and implement a substitute budget. This budget<br />\nwould have eliminated funding<br />\nfor the Council Speaker Committee, the Martin Luther King<br />\nLectureship, the Kennedy Lectureship and the Council Concert Committee. The funding<br />\nfor the Concert Committee<br />\nwould have been combined<br />\nwith that of the Social Committee.

After<br />\na total of two years at the<br />\nHopkins Institutes, the student<br />\nwill get his baccalaureate from<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAccording to Anderson,. this<br />\nprogram will be highly cornpetitive, and, students must<br />\ndemonstrate leadership ability,<br />\nhigh academic achievement,<br />\nhumanitarianism and creativity<br />\nin biomedical research.<br />\n\"What we really want to do<br />\nis to open up the pathways to<br />\neducation,\" said Anderson,<br />\n\"allowing students to get a<br />\nvariety of life experience on the<br />\nway.\" The program also tries<br />\nto integrate the traditionally<br />\n\"isolated undergraduate and<br />\nmed school learning experience.\"<br />\nApplications to the Flex-Med<br />\nprogram, open to students at<br />\nany accredited college, will be<br />\navailable beginning ,July 1,<br />\n1983. Students who will be<br />\njuniors in the fall, with at least<br />\n60 credits, and students who<br />\nwill be seniors in the fall, with<br />\nat least 90 credits, will be eligible for the program. According<br />\nto Anderson, the application<br />\nwill be the same as the regular<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine<br />\napplication, except for an insert<br />\nthat will offer the applicant<br />\nchoices of the career options<br />\navailable under the program.<br />\nA special committee will be<br />\nformed by the School of Medicine which will help the applicants choose their career options. A member of the undergraduate health professions advising board will serve on this<br />\nspecial committee. The objective of the committee is to<br />\ncreate the program \"which is<br />\nbest for each individual,\"<br />\nAnderson said.

Not necessarily. Certainly,<br />\nmore attention to the undergraduate curriculum, Financial aid and housing is warranted. A major shift in emphasis, however,<br />\ntowards undergraduates at Hopkins if at the<br />\nexpense of the graduate program, may have<br />\nsome unintended and undesirable consequences. A shift towards undergraduates could<br />\nprove disastrous to the humanities and social<br />\nsciences at Hopkins, unless preventative steps<br />\nare taken.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is, and probably always<br />\nwill be, a graduate-oriented institution.<br />\nNevertheless, over the past ten to fifteen<br />\nyears, Hopkins' emphasis has shifted somewhat towards undergraduate education.<br />\nUndergraduate enrollment has increased<br />\ndramatically; the number of graduate students has declined slightly. While graduate<br />\nstudents have battled to attain financial aid<br />\nawards that are competitive with peer institutions, federal policies have made it easier for<br />\na greater number of Americans to afford a<br />\ncollege education at the undergraduate level.<br />\nRecent shifts in the economy and government philosophy may result in a crisis in<br />\nhigher education. As funds dwindle, institutions such as Hopkins may be forced to<br />\nmake difficult choices. Hopkins must decide<br />\nhow to balance undergraduates with graduates, the humanities and social sciences with<br />\nthe sciences. Already, the administration hass<br />\nprovided indications that it will try to offset declining federal monies for undergraduate financial aid with University<br />\nmoney. Such a proposition is not only commendable but essential to maintain equality.<br />\nof opportunity for a college education. This<br />\ntype of commitment is expensive, however,<br />\nand could conceivably be financed at the expense of any graduate aid currently dependent on University funds.<br />\nFurther decreases in graduate aid have<br />\nsevere implications for non-science departments at Hopkins. Many departments in the<br />\nsocial sciences and humanities depend on<br />\ngraduate students for their strength. The<br />\nHistory Department, for instance, is one of<br />\nthe strongest in the nation. Aside from<br />\nresearch, its primary function is to train<br />\ngraduate students. Undergraduates, however, can reap benefits by taking courses by<br />\npremier historians. Cutting back on graduate<br />\nprograms, thus, makes it more difficult for<br />\nundergraduates to receive a well-rounded,<br />\n<br />\nliberal arts education. The connection between undergraduate enrollment and graduate programs is most important when it<br />\ncomes to the issue of teaching positions.<br />\nMany graduate programs justify their request funds on the grounds that they need<br />\nteaching assistants to instruct undergraduates. Although the administration tries to<br />\navoid having undergraduate enrollment dictating support for the graduate program, the<br />\nfact remains that in all likelihood, it' there<br />\nare to be any further cuts in graduate aid,<br />\nthey will affect those departments that do<br />\nnot use the money for teaching positions.<br />\nThis puts departments such as Classics and<br />\nNear Eastern Studies in a very precarious<br />\nposition because very few undergrads take<br />\ncourses in these areas. Such departments,<br />\ntherefore, have little need for teaching positions. Unless admissions policies change,<br />\nteaching positions for graduate students will<br />\ncontinue to be available in the sciences,<br />\nbecause most Hopkins undergraduates take<br />\nmany science courses..<br />\nIf' the size of the undergraduate body remains the same in the midst of tough financial times, there are, nevertheless, several<br />\nways by which to avoid the declension of<br />\nliberal arts at Hopkins. The best but most<br />\ndifficult solution would entail changing the<br />\nimage of Hopkins in order to attract more<br />\nliberal arts majors. The recent acquisition of<br />\nthe Peabody Conservatory and the development of academic programs in Italy and<br />\nChina contribute to a shift in image. Yet as<br />\nlong as Hopkins Hospital and Med School are<br />\ninternationally renowned, Hopkins will continue to attract many science-oriented<br />\nundergraduates. A more feasible alternative<br />\nwould entail a restructuring of the<br />\nundergraduate curriculum that would require<br />\nstudents to pursue .a broader liberal arts<br />\neducation, thus, saving some social science<br />\nand humanities departments from death.<br />\nOf course, if the University's capital campaign is successful, there will be no reason<br />\nto worry; there will be enough money to support a strong graduate as well as undergraduate program, thus maintaining the<br />\nbalance of liberal arts versus sciences at<br />\nHopkins. Yet there is no guarantee that the<br />\nUniversity will be able to obtain the revenue<br />\nnecessary to fulfill all of its desires, and if<br />\nfunds decrease, difficult choices will have to<br />\nbe made. It is important to begin thinking<br />\nabout these choices and to understand some<br />\nof the not so obvious implications that some<br />\nof these choices entait.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nRisking Harm To Students To Make The Campus Attractive Is Inexcusable<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhat is the reason for the<br />\ndestruction of plants around<br />\nthe trees on campus? Why is<br />\npoison being used to remove<br />\nthem? Who makes the decision<br />\nto use potentially harmful<br />\nchemicals on campus? What<br />\ncriteria justify their use?<br />\nLittle signs stapled to trees<br />\nexplain that the herbicide used<br />\nto kill the plants around them<br />\nis \"comparatively Safe.\" If<br />\n\"applied in proper amounts,\"<br />\n<br />\nthe sign continues, the trees<br />\n\"should\" suffer little damage<br />\nand the area should be \"reasonably sale /or sitlike or playing within a short lime.\" Further, \"the herbicide is not expected to sign/Jim/illy disturb<br />\nthe worm/bird biochain, nor<br />\nshould ground water runoff be<br />\nmach polluted.\" (Italics mine<br />\nthroughout.)<br />\nMy concerns about the ecological wisdom of this poisoning are heightened rather than<br />\n<br />\ncalmed by the explanation provided. It acknowledges that<br />\nsome ecological damage will occur and that there is some risk<br />\nto students playing or silting on<br />\ncampus. The disadvantages of<br />\nthe action taken must logically<br />\noutweigh the advantages, since<br />\nthere is not an advantage to be<br />\ngained by removing greenery<br />\nfrom the bases of trees.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\n<br />\nMary Sophia Smith<br />\n<br />\nWe as undergraduates applaud the initial attempts of our<br />\nalumni (see last week's Letter to<br />\nthe Editor) to return rock music<br />\nto the Spring Fair. As currently enrolled students, however,<br />\nwe feel that more should be<br />\ndone. We believe that undergraduates should be able to examine the specific reasoning of<br />\nthe administration for the ban,<br />\nand then to formulate their own<br />\nresponses in order to initiate a<br />\nmore open discussion in planning the fair.<br />\nAs best we can imagine, these<br />\nare the administration's arguments.<br />\nI. Rock music brings a security risk to the fair. Two<br />\nyears ago a knife was pulled out<br />\non the Gilman Stage. However,<br />\nit should be remembered that<br />\nthe -knife was put away, without<br />\nan incident, following the request of a security guard. This<br />\nlone incident, which occurred<br />\ntwo years ago, is now the basis<br />\nof a universal policy banning<br />\nrock music. By this time they<br />\nhave created a walkie-talkie<br />\nequipped student security force,<br />\n. have beefed-up Hopkins security, restricted beer to one<br />\nfenced-in area, and have banned rock music. The combination of these measures makes as<br />\nmuch sense as using a tank to<br />\nclear a kitchen of roaches.<br />\n2. Rock music leads to<br />\nalcohol abuse. Again, new<br />\nmeasures have more than compensated for any potential problems. The drinking age has<br />\nbeen raised, and beer will be<br />\nrestricted to the President's<br />\nGarden (enclosed by a double<br />\nfence with a \"no-man's land\"<br />\nin between fences) with only<br />\none entrance. There will also be<br />\na strict enforcement of IDs at<br />\nthe entrance. With an adequate<br />\nsecurity system and a restriction<br />\non alcohol sales and use, it is<br />\nhard to believe that alcoholrelated problems would occur<br />\ndue to the presence of rock<br />\nbands at the fair. But perhaps<br />\nthe point is that these are not<br />\nthe real issues behind the administration's argument, for<br />\nthey have all been resolved. Instead, the administration\u2014a la<br />\n<br />\nJames Watt\u2014wants to keep<br />\nthose it sees as \"undesirables\"<br />\noff this campus, during the<br />\nSpring Fair and otherwise.<br />\nWho suffers the most from<br />\nthese policies'? The students of<br />\nHopkins. We must keep in<br />\nmind that the Spring Fair was<br />\ncreated to encourage more interaction between JHU and the<br />\ncommunity and we, as students, still feel the need for an<br />\nopen policy towards the community. Furthermore, by trying<br />\nto isolate the campus from the<br />\ncommunity, the administration<br />\nhas managed to ruin the fair for<br />\nits own students. With a little<br />\nbit of common sense and all of<br />\nthe restrictions already imposed on the fair, it should be<br />\npossible for students to enjoy<br />\none of the few things they have<br />\nin common: an appreciation of<br />\nrock music.<br />\nWith this goal in mind, we<br />\nwould like to make a few requests of the administration.<br />\nI. To publicly explain, in<br />\nclear and precise terms, their<br />\nargument against rock music.<br />\nThis should appear in next<br />\nweek's News-Letter. (After all,<br />\nhow can students respond intelligently to the administration's policies if they are not<br />\nallowed to know the reasons<br />\nbehind the policies'?)<br />\n2. At the minimum, to remove the ban barring Hopkins'<br />\nown student bands from performing at the Spring Fair.<br />\nThese students, who have paid<br />\nthousands of dollars to attend<br />\nthe University, should have the<br />\nright to share their skills and<br />\ntalents with fellow students.<br />\nThe fact is that the administration will not be able to bar<br />\nstudents from playing at their<br />\nown fair. Student musicians<br />\nwill surely appear, through an<br />\nunderground guerilla-musician's network, to provide<br />\nsolace for tired (and certainly<br />\nappreciative) ears, in the spots<br />\nyou would least expect and<br />\ntimes you would least imagine.<br />\nMelanie May '85<br />\nHelen McCreedy<br />\nLuis Cruz<br />\nPhillip Schmandt<br />\nMartin Yon<br />\nBrian Ferguson<br />\ncorn. on p.5<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nAndrew Hurley..................................................

I feel<br />\nawfully gassy. I've burped three<br />\ntimes since I got here two<br />\nminutes ago. I'm not really sure<br />\nwho brought me here. I think<br />\nit was a big, fat man who is<br />\nholding me too tightly. He also<br />\nlikes to throw me up in the air<br />\nand then catch me. He almost<br />\ndropped me one time but grabbed my feet just before my head<br />\nwas about to hit the concrete.<br />\nI'm sitting in the back of the<br />\nroom. Most of the people are<br />\nsitting in front of me. They<br />\ndon't look too nice. There's a<br />\nman all the way up front who<br />\nis standing behind a \u2022 stereo<br />\nspeaker.

They have<br />\nsincerely tried to be fair to all<br />\ngroups this year. It is unfortunate that Steve Levine, Grant<br />\nLally, Maureen Freed and<br />\nothers of their group have tried<br />\nto undermine their fine job.<br />\nAlthough their motives may<br />\nhave been noble, Mr. Levine<br />\net.al. made a travesty of the<br />\nbudgeting process of the SAC.<br />\nThis year, all SAC groups were<br />\nnot able to receive all of the<br />\nfunds which they requested for<br />\nthe 1983-84 school year. However, a few groups connected<br />\nwith Mr. Levine, Mr. Lally<br />\neta!. tried to profit by making<br />\ndeals with other groups so they<br />\ncould get the funds they<br />\nwanted.<br />\nAt the meetings, Mr. Levine<br />\nproposed an alternative budget.<br />\nIn this budget, Mr. Levine<br />\nclaimed that his group contacted \"most\" of the groups<br />\nasking for funds from the SAC<br />\nthis year. When confronted for<br />\na listing of the groups contacted, Mr. Levine objected<br />\nstating it was not pertinent to<br />\nthe issue. As I found out later,<br />\nthe groups which received an<br />\nincrease in the alternative budget were those that were contacted. The number of groups<br />\ncontacted, according to Maureen Freed, was 16. The number<br />\n<br />\nof SAC groups contacted that<br />\nwished funding from the SAC<br />\nin this total, was 15. The<br />\nnumber of SAC groups that<br />\nwished to be funded next year<br />\nby the SAC is 31. This is not a<br />\ndefinition of \"most\"!<br />\nWhen the question was raised again, Mr. Levine was also<br />\nasked how groups were decided to be contacted. He stated<br />\nthat it was based on the amount<br />\nthat they requested minus the<br />\namount they got and also if the<br />\ngroup received less funding<br />\nthan 1983. I then stated that the<br />\nOutdoors Club fit into this<br />\ncategory. Mr. Levine, confronted with the fact that the<br />\nOutdoors Club received the<br />\nthird highest figure by their<br />\ncalculations, entered into<br />\nnegotiations to stop the objections. They offered to increase<br />\nthe Outdoors Club appropriations by $500. This showed that<br />\nall they were interested in was<br />\nto pass their own budget for<br />\ntheir own profit and that they<br />\nwere not concerned with the<br />\nwelfare of other groups. They<br />\ndid not even ask what the Outdoors Club needed the additional funds for. So Maureen<br />\nFreed, Mr. Lally and Mr. Levine, this is what you term<br />\nfairness to SAC groups. Your<br />\ntactics are appalling. There are<br />\nno ethics involved. If you<br />\nthought the budget presented<br />\nby the SAC was so bad, why<br />\ndid you not just reject it?

Examples are the Band, The Outdoors Club, etc. So why don't<br />\nwe do things the right way and<br />\nnot try to \"screw\" anybody<br />\nand play it fair.<br />\nLee Shang<br />\nesident, Outdoors Club<br />\n<br />\nClarification<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nIn the April 8 edition of the<br />\nNews-Letter some general<br />\nremarks of Professor Joseph<br />\nSampson were erroneously<br />\nassociated with Dean Suskind's<br />\nresearch plans. No such connection was intended.<br />\n<br />\nPorter Is Disrupter Of Student Activities<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhat is Mary Ellen Porter's<br />\njob? Last week the News-Letter<br />\nprinted that she was Director,of<br />\nStudent Activities. In that same<br />\narticle, and in a later one, we<br />\nread that not only did she think<br />\nthat student groups shouldn't<br />\nask for (and to read between<br />\nthe lines, didn't deserve) extra<br />\nmoney for the next scholastic<br />\nyear, but then she decides that<br />\nstudents shouldn't have the<br />\ntype of music they want to hear<br />\nat a student-run activity. After<br />\nreading this, one might get the<br />\nimpression that her title should<br />\nbe<br />\nDisrupter of Student<br />\nActivities.<br />\nI acknowledge that all University budgets are tight this<br />\nyear, but so are student group<br />\nbudgets. Apparently, Mary Ellen Porter's Union Board budget is not tight. The Union<br />\nBoard, under her direction, has<br />\nbrought us such financial<br />\nfiascos as the Bahamas party,<br />\nand probably will do it again<br />\nnext year. Meanwhile, she has<br />\nthe audacity to insinuate that<br />\nstudent groups shouldn't get<br />\nmore money because, in light of<br />\none mismanaged event, the administration assumes that all<br />\nstudent groups are negligent.<br />\nNot only is the point of her<br />\nargument against more student<br />\nmoney blatantly false\u2014very<br />\nfew groups lose money\u2014but<br />\nwhy isn't part of her job to go<br />\nto the administration and let<br />\nthem know that the concert was<br />\none isolated incident? Why<br />\ndidn't she stick up for us, at<br />\nleast in public, instead of seizing the moment to take a slap<br />\nat all student groups?<br />\n<br />\nFrom her public declarations<br />\nto her insidious attempts to<br />\nhinder the Course Guide and<br />\nother groups, Mary Ellen Porter has tried hard to ignore<br />\nmany student groups. In light<br />\nof all this, I ask again: What is<br />\nMary Ellen Porter's job?<br />\n<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nTed Hayes<br />\n<br />\nman is talking. He looks like<br />\nthe man who brought me into<br />\nthe room. But he looks friendlier. I wonder if he'll give me a<br />\nsip of his Coke which is next to<br />\ntwo other cans of Coke.<br />\nIn front of the man, who is<br />\nfacing me, are people between<br />\nhe and I. Most people are closer<br />\nto him. They keep asking him<br />\nquestions. He answers them<br />\nquickly. When they talk back,<br />\nhe times their responses. And<br />\nwhen they ask questions about<br />\nmoney, he picks up a calculator<br />\nwhich is on top of the speaker.<br />\nSome of the numbers are large,<br />\nbut some are small. The man<br />\nup front thinks that six plus<br />\nnine is twelve. He is wrong.<br />\nAnd everyone else yells, \"Try<br />\nagain, Harry.\" Harry is the<br />\nname of the man up front.<br />\nThere are a few people who<br />\nare smoking cigarettes. I don't<br />\nlike smoke. Mommy says it's<br />\nbad for me. What they usually<br />\ndo is sit with their legs crossed<br />\nand blow the smoke into the<br />\nair. And it's a funny thing. As<br />\nsoon as they finish smoking<br />\none, they smoke another.<br />\nI'm beginning to drool. On<br />\nthe big, fat man's lap. He<br />\ndoesn't notice at first. When he<br />\ndoes, he puts me on the floor.<br />\nI fall down and begin to cry.<br />\nEveryone turns around, and a<br />\nlady sitting next to me picks me<br />\nup. She doesn't look like Mommy. She begins talking to me.<br />\nI don't know what she's saying.<br />\nI'm still crying.<br />\n\"Congratulations, Mary Ellen,\" says the Beaver, who is<br />\nsitting in front of me.<br />\nShe takes me out of the<br />\n1- 00ITI.<br />\n<br />\n\"You're the only baby who<br />\nhas ever attended an SAC<br />\ngeneral meeting.\"<br />\n<br />\nWill The Soviet Union Survive Until 1984<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n\"Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?\" That is the<br />\nquestion a Soviet dissident<br />\nauthor, Andrei Amalrik, posed<br />\nin a book published in 1970,<br />\nafter his involuntary servitude<br />\nin Siberian labor camps.

Since you're so close to<br />\nsuch a great attraction, make a point of visiting it<br />\none weekend afternoon before your few years here<br />\nhave passed.<br />\nThe B&O Railroad Museum, located about 1 mile<br />\nwest of the Inner Harbor, on Pratt Street, contains<br />\nenough equipment and displays to inspire a keen<br />\ninterest in railroads in even the most casual<br />\nobserver. The museum, originally opened for permanent k iewing in 1953, is located on the site of _<br />\nmany \"firsts\" in America. From these grounds.<br />\nAmerica's first passenger and freight trains were<br />\ndispatched, and also here the nation's first depot<br />\nwas built. On this site, Peter Cooper, in 1830, constructed America's first locomoti\u2018e, the Tom<br />\nrhumb. From one of the buildings of the museum<br />\n,complex the world's first telegraph message,\"What<br />\nHath God Wrought?\" was transmitted.<br />\nThe centerpiece of the museum is its huge (240<br />\nfeet in diameter, 123 feet in height) roundhouse,<br />\nthat was erected 1883-1884. The museum and<br />\ngrounds underwent a $2 million renovation during<br />\nthe early 1970s, in preparation for the sesquicentennial celebration of the B&O Railroad's founding in<br />\n1827. The museum is expected to attract over<br />\n100,000 visitors this year.<br />\nLocated all around the exterior of the museum<br />\nare dozens of locomotives and cars, each a significant milestone in man's progress on the rails.<br />\nAmong the first things that one sees upon entering<br />\nthe museum is the B&O Railroad's \"First Stone:.<br />\nThis stone was set in place on July 4, 1828, by<br />\nCharles Carrollton, the last surviving signer of the<br />\nDeclaration of Independence.<br />\nAfter viewing many historic documents and paintings that show the growth of the B&O Railroad, the<br />\nisitor sees to his extreme left a large model of the<br />\nfirst race in the U.S. between a horse and a steam<br />\nlocomotive (the Tom Thumb) which took place on<br />\nAugust 25, 1830. .1-he horse won. The visitor then<br />\nviews some other interesting railroad memorabilia,<br />\nincluding the massive front of a modern locomotive,<br />\nand a display of fine china that was used on trains<br />\nduring the 19th century.<br />\nThe imagination is further fueled by a stop at the<br />\n\"Observation Car,\" the multimedia theater within<br />\nthe museum. Among the films shown is the Chessie<br />\nS'/earn Special, a film that documents the 8,000-mile<br />\npilgrimage of that train across the U.S. in the summer of 1977. It commemorated 150 years of operation of the B&O Railroad. This six-month journey<br />\nallowed over 25,000 riders to experience the thrill<br />\nof riding behind a coal-powered steam locomotive.<br />\nIt is estimated that one million people came to see<br />\nthe train as it pulled into the many small-town stations along its route.<br />\nOn the second floor of the museum is located<br />\nthe majority of its small-scale railroad display. Sur-<br />\n<br />\n\flackoEyed Susies Anymore<br />\nworkouts, each horse is warmed down, washed, fed<br />\nand groomed. The track is prepared for the day's<br />\nevents, and the crowds begin to appear soon after<br />\n12:00 for the 1:00 post time.<br />\nThe horses which race at Pimlico are among the<br />\nfastest in the world. They are trained year-round.<br />\nbut most intensely from December to September.<br />\nMost horses begin to race seriously in April of their<br />\nsecond year. The majority of the horses which race<br />\nat Pimlico are between three and eight years old,<br />\nand they will each race once every five to ten days,<br />\ndepending upon the time of season, their conditioning, and their age.<br />\nPimlico itself has an illustrious history. It first<br />\nopened on October 25, 1870, and after Saratoga,<br />\nis the second-oldest race track in the United States.<br />\nIt is owned and operated by the Maryland Jockey<br />\nClub, the nation's oldest sporting association.<br />\nPimlico is the home of the National Jockeys' Hall<br />\nof Fame and the Woodlawn Vase, billed as \"the<br />\nmost valuable trophy in American sports.\" The<br />\nvase, valued at over $750,000, is the Preakness<br />\ntrophy. Since 1953, a half-sized reproduction of the<br />\nvase has been awarded to the Preakness winner<br />\n<br />\nevery year.<br />\nIt is the Preakness, of course, for which Pimlico<br />\nis best known. The Preakness is the middle jewel<br />\nof the Triple Crown, three races held every year and<br />\nregarded as the best of the racing world. The other<br />\ntwo classics of the Friple Crown are the Kentucky<br />\nDerby and the Belmont Stakes. These races are<br />\nreserved for the premier three-year-olds in the land,<br />\nand have hosted all the great names in thoroughbred<br />\nhistory: Man O'War, Secretariat, Seattle Slew, Affirmed, Spectacular Bid and more.<br />\nIn recent years, the Preakness has become almost<br />\nas famous for its infield party as for its racing quality. Pimlico general manager Chick Lang contends<br />\nthat \"it's Woodstock, a family picnic, the Indy 500,<br />\nand a carnival all rolled into one.\" Infield attendance alone has grown from 12,000 in 1971 f o over<br />\n50,000 last year. \"You've got to be there when they<br />\n'pop' the gates at 9:00 to believe it,\" says Lang.<br />\n\"They carry scaffolding, homemade coolers of<br />\nevery description, grills, pieces of canvas, plywood,<br />\nand whatever they need for homemade construction. They have beach umbrellas, tents, blankets<br />\nand trash cans or wash tubs filled with ice and<br />\n<br />\ndrinks. Some use wheelbarrows, wagons, or shopping carts.\"<br />\nPimlico officials are not averse to the reputation<br />\nthat the Preakness infield has acquired. They bill<br />\nthe infield as the younger crowd's Preakness. If<br />\nsome of these younger fans catch the racing bug,<br />\nPimlico will benefit in the long run, explains Lang.<br />\nOtherwise,\"we promote the idea to come out and<br />\npicnic, and have fun.\"<br />\nPimlico, with its colorful 113-year tradition, has<br />\nachieved a position of admiration among racing<br />\nfans from Baltimore and beyond. From the prestige<br />\nof the Preakness to \"Cockey\" Johnson', from the<br />\nin ield party to the Woodlawn Vase, from that lonely 6:00 a.m. workout to the 1:00 post time, Pimlico<br />\nhas become a tradition rooted in the horse racing<br />\nhistory of America and the world.<br />\n<br />\nCorrection:<br />\nLast week's interview with Edward Albee<br />\nwas written by Todd Rosen.

Soon to come to this part Of the<br />\nmuseum, as a permanent display, are hundreds<br />\nmore model trains and a gargantuan '0' scale<br />\nlayout, all the gift of a generous man from Ohio.<br />\nThe fact that nearly all the displays and railroad<br />\nequipment are the generous donations of private individuals and corporations emphasizes how the<br />\nmuseum was established and is still run. The B&O<br />\nMuseum has no funding ties to the city of<br />\nBaltimore\u2014its funding is almost entirely from the<br />\nB&O Railroad, now part of the Chessie System.<br />\nMrs. Marian E. Smith, the director of the museum,<br />\nstressed that the work done here is nearly all that<br />\nof individuals who care very much to preserve<br />\nAmerica's railroading past. The work force of the<br />\nmuseum\u2014its many volunteers, especially those<br />\nfrom the B&O Historical Society, are involved in<br />\nall aspects of its operation. Their main job is that<br />\nof the restoration of old trains, where their strength<br />\nand skills shine through. Upon completion of each<br />\nmajor restoration project, a special exhibit is created<br />\nwhich highlights the finished product of years of<br />\nlabor.<br />\nAfter returning to the main level of the museum,<br />\nthe visitor walks, with growing anticipation, toward<br />\nwhat is probably the greatest shrine of railroading<br />\ntoday\u2014the roundhouse, with its large central turntable. It has 22 stalls which contain the oldest of<br />\nthe museum's unparalleled collection of historic<br />\nlocomotives and cars. Totally immersed in sights<br />\nand sounds of the railroad era, one feels temporarily<br />\ntransported to a time when the railroads were king,<br />\nan age especially hard to imagine now, when the<br />\nautomobile is ubiquitous.<br />\nHere one can see a working, authentic-to-the-lastdetail full-scale replica of the Tom Thumb; the<br />\nworld's oldest passenger vehicle (and dozens of<br />\nothers), and the many handcrafted Pangborn<br />\nReplicas of the last century. These full-scale models<br />\nwere the vision and creation of Joseph G.<br />\nPangborn, the legendary PR man of the B&O.<br />\n<br />\nThese<br />\nmodels, along with the<br />\nother restored engines, became, in the last<br />\ndecade of the 19th . cent urN ,<br />\npart of the largest industrial exhibit<br />\never mounted, at the Field Museum of<br />\nthe Columbian Exposition. Counting these<br />\nreplicas, the museum now contains o\u2018er 50 preserved locomotives.<br />\nFor a break from the displays stop at `Nos(algia<br />\nStation,' the B&O Museum's famous (at least<br />\namong railroad buffs) gift shop.<br />\nFor late spring and summer, the museum has<br />\nplanned many diversions. A snack train, operating<br />\non weekends from May to late summer, will slake<br />\neven the most insatiable appetite. During the third<br />\nweekend of every month in the summer (July-September) there will be rides aboard a steam engine<br />\nalong several miles of track around the museum.<br />\nThe museum is also thinking of sponsoring a spikedriving contest. To get there, take the Number 3<br />\nbus downtown. Every weekend this summer will<br />\nfeature a shuttle bus operating from the Inner Harbor to the museum.<br />\nThe museum is currently cataloging its entire archives, which contain information on nearly every<br />\naspect of trains and railroading. Mrs. Smith who,<br />\nalong with her staff, is completing this job, encouraged. anyone with a serious academic inquiry<br />\nabout railroads to contact her office. She noted that<br />\nmany times in the past she has had Hopkins<br />\nstudents do some phase of their research at the<br />\nmuseum.<br />\nMrs. Smith sees the museum as one that is constantly growing, thriving and searching out new<br />\nthings to accomplish. Part of this achievement rests<br />\non the B&O Railroad, whose financial support is<br />\n<br />\ncritical,<br />\nand whose<br />\nleadership over<br />\nmany decades was in<br />\nry,<br />\nthe forefront of preserv/ife<br />\nri<br />\ning great examples of rail,<br />\nroading in America. The B&O's<br />\n\"<br />\nstake in this past is unimaginable.<br />\nOften called the \"Railroad University of<br />\nAmerica,\" the B&O was the first railroad to publish a timetable (May 23, 1830), the first to use a<br />\nbaggage car (1834), the first to place an electric<br />\nlocomotive in regular service (July 27, 1895), and<br />\nthe first to operate a completely air-conditioned<br />\ntrain (May 1931).<br />\nMrs. Smith sees the birth and development of the<br />\nmuseum as corresponding to Baltimore's Renaissance, and imparts to those who listen a strong and<br />\nhealthy \"Baltimore is Best\" feeling.<br />\nAt just $2.00 for adult admission, join rail buffs<br />\nand the just plain inquisitive from all across the<br />\ncountry, and visit the \"Railroad University\" of the<br />\npast and the growing showplace of railroading of<br />\nthe present.

Put a happy dancer on stage, provide him with expressive choreography,<br />\nand watch him shine. After seeing the<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins Dance Company perform, you'll understand this<br />\npleasant phenomenon.

It's<br />\nclear that not only do the company<br />\nmembers enjoy what they're doing.<br />\nthey're also very good at what they do.<br />\nThe company was formed last spring<br />\nby a group of students, some dancers<br />\nand others students who wanted to<br />\nlearn. Although the company had a successful spring concert last year, the emphasis was not so much on performing<br />\nas it was on establishing a core group of<br />\ncommitted dancers. As one member explains, \"There was a definite enthusiasm<br />\nlast year that will he hard to match<br />\nagain.

An aged Antonio Salieri, et)<br />\ncomposer to .loseph II, relives his rivalr<br />\nwith the young genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart over the course of the long<br />\nevening before the dawn at which he will<br />\nattempt suicide. During the years 1781<br />\nto 1791, Salieri was a prosperous court<br />\nfigure, Mozart \"a vulgar, cackling upstart. Salieri's jealousy of Mozart's<br />\ntalents (Mozart transcribes onto paper<br />\ncomplete works he has fully orchestrated in his head) is not so much a byproduct of personal dislike, although<br />\nthat is present, but of a quarrel with<br />\nGod: why should Catholic Salieri, who<br />\nwants only to exalt the Lord with his<br />\ncompositions, have to suffer mediocrity when the irreligious, obscene Mozart<br />\npossesses such gifts?<br />\nThis is the central idea of Peter Shaffer's play, which under the direction of<br />\nPeter Hall runs through April 25 at the<br />\nMorris A.

With nothing like the psychological<br />\n<br />\nresults is a work that jumps from one<br />\nscene to the next without taking the time<br />\nto develop satisfying dramaturgical<br />\nlinks.<br />\nTo criticize the play, though, is not<br />\nnecessarily to criticize the production.<br />\nThe staging is ornate yet simple, the<br />\ntnovement through time fluid and coherent. Mark Hamill plays Mozart competently, although betraying mannerisms reminiscent not of Luke Skywalker (surprise!) but of Tim Curry,<br />\nwho has played this part in at least one<br />\nother production.<br />\nJohn Wood, as Salieri, holds the<br />\nshow together. He makes seamless transitions between the old and the young<br />\nSalieri, and between great extremes in<br />\nemotion.

Sophomore Alex Tang<br />\nis currently at number-two<br />\nsingles. \"Alex also improved a<br />\nlot over the summer,\" said San-<br />\n<br />\nIvor Longo<br />\ntamaria. \"He was erratic as a<br />\n<br />\nrespectively. All three have<br />\n<br />\nfreshman, but that was due to<br />\nhis inexperience.\"<br />\nAt numbers four, five and six<br />\nsingles are sophomore Bill<br />\n(;illespie, junior Mark Fusco,<br />\nand sophomore Dinh Njuyen,<br />\n<br />\nplayed well so far, but Fusco<br />\nhas seen little action due to<br />\nacademic commitments..Santamaria does, however, expect<br />\nhim to play a prominent role<br />\nduring the remainder of the<br />\n<br />\nseason. Rounding out the team<br />\nare juniors Doug Baruch and<br />\nSandy Teng, and sophomore<br />\nDave Gibbs.<br />\nThe team has played extremely well, with only a tough<br />\nloss to UMBC blemishing their<br />\n<br />\nrecord. Among the team's five<br />\nvictories was an amazing 5-4<br />\nwin over always tough Drew<br />\nUniversity, a team that has<br />\nbeaten Hopkins the last two<br />\nyears. \"We really didn't expect<br />\nto win,\" said Santamaria. \"It<br />\nwas an excellent win for us.\" In<br />\nthe squad's most recent match<br />\nto date, they outscored Western<br />\nMaryland by a 5-1 margin.<br />\nCoach Santamaria already<br />\nfeels that this year's team is better than last year's edition.<br />\n\"We have a better attitude this<br />\nyear,\" he explained. \"We're<br />\nreally coming together as a<br />\nteam. There's no animosity between the players. They're all<br />\nreally pulling for each otner out<br />\nthere, and that's what it's all<br />\nabout.\"<br />\nThe team's depth has also<br />\nimproved. \"I wouldn't say we<br />\nhave one real strong player,\"<br />\nsaid Santamaria. \"We have<br />\nstrength all through our<br />\nlineup\u2014that's our strength.\"<br />\nAside from his 13-3 prediction, Santamaria sees many<br />\nother positive things happening<br />\nthis season. He believes that<br />\nevery man on the team will have<br />\na winning record, and that<br />\nmany of his players will fare<br />\nwell in the individual MAC<br />\ntournament.<br />\nAnd what about capturing<br />\nthe MAC this season? \"1<br />\nwouldn't anticipate it,\" said<br />\nSantamaria. \"But it's definitely a possibility.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe G.

The time has<br />\ncome for action. We all know<br />\nthat your Yankees won't have<br />\nenough talent to win the<br />\nAmerican League East crown.<br />\nSo far, you've gone out and<br />\nbought two high-priced sluggers, and you're confident in<br />\ntheir god-like ability to lift the<br />\nYankees from fifth place.<br />\nSorry, George, but we can't<br />\nbuy that anymore.<br />\n<br />\nwho won 15 or more games.<br />\nEven your southern counterpart, Mr. Turner, knows the<br />\nvalue of good pitching, making<br />\nsure Steve Bedrosian (ERA<br />\n2.42), Terry Forster (3.04),<br />\nGene Garba (2.34) and Phil<br />\nNiekro (17-4) signed with his<br />\nteam.<br />\nWhat did you have against<br />\nRon Davis? You sentenced him<br />\nto exile in Minnesota after<br />\ntrading for Roy Smalley, insisting that Bucky Dent was not<br />\ngood enough for your team.<br />\nWith Ron Davis, your bullpen<br />\n-was unbeatable. With Roy<br />\nSmalley, you have a .257<br />\naverage and defensive problems<br />\n<br />\nyou, George, and many of the<br />\nbest baseball prospects bear a<br />\nYankee of Clipper education..<br />\nBut why are they scattered all<br />\nover the league, instead of playing in New York? Graig Nettles<br />\nis getting old, but you let both<br />\nof his possible replacements get<br />\naway. Pay Tobler hit .342 for<br />\nthe White Sox' AAA affiliate,<br />\nand Tucker Ashford hit .331<br />\nfor Columbus (your AAA<br />\nteam\u2014remember?), only to be<br />\nsent to Toronto. Tim Rollan<br />\nwon 16 games in San Diego and<br />\nWillie McGee was a key to St.<br />\nLouis' championship performance.<br />\nGeorge, you need one thing<br />\n<br />\nYanks are looking bad<br />\n<br />\nMr. Steinbrenner, you have<br />\na counterpart in Atlanta, named Ted Turner. Like you, he at shortstop. Sure, George,<br />\npays very high prices to very you've gone out and bought all<br />\npowerful hitters\u2014players such kinds of' pitchers, but look at<br />\nas Bob Horner, Dale Murphy them and their numbers: Doyle<br />\nand Chris Chambliss (remem- Alexander (ERA 6.08), Steve<br />\nber him?). However, he has one Corner (5.10), Roger Erickson<br />\nthing you lack\u2014baseball sense. (4.46), Shane Rawley (4.06)and<br />\nWhen the Braves lost to St. Bob Shirley (8-13). Sorry,<br />\nLouis in the National League George, but Rich Gossage can't<br />\nplayoffs, he did not go on a win 60 games this year\u2014he's<br />\nbuying binge. Instead, he gave only human.<br />\nmore money to his already solid<br />\nSeeing that you don't believe<br />\nteam. There was no ranting and in pitching, George, you've<br />\nraving about \"poor perfor- turned toward stocking your<br />\nmances\" and \"not gik ing it offensive arsenal with some of<br />\nyour best.\" Mr. Turner has pa- the best power hitters in the<br />\ntience, and his club will some- game today, by buying Don<br />\nday win the World Series be- Baylor and Steve Kemp to go<br />\ncause of that patience.<br />\nalong with Dave Winfield. But<br />\nnow you've got too many good<br />\nGeorge, what do you hake outfielders, and you'll have to<br />\nagainst pitching? Have you bench a .300 hitter.<br />\nMeanwhile, your infield is<br />\nnever heard the expression<br />\n\"pitching wins ballgames'?\" falling apart. Ken Griffey is<br />\nApparently, you don't believe sure to make many mistakes at<br />\nit, and you need to see some first base. Roy Smalley is poor<br />\nLoncrete proof that it is true. St. defensively at short, and Graig<br />\nLouis, last year's World Series Nettles has lost more than a few<br />\nchampions, had a team ERA of steps at third. In addition, their<br />\n3.37, third best in the National offensive play is bringing the<br />\nLeague. California, who won team down. What do you plan<br />\nthe American League West, to da about that, George?<br />\nYou've ensured that the<br />\nhad an ERA of 3.82, second<br />\nonly to Detroit. Baltimore, who Yankee tradition\" carries down<br />\nalmost won the American to your farm clubs, too. The<br />\nLeague East, had four pitchers best baseball scouts work for<br />\n<br />\nthat other general managers<br />\nhave, and that you can't buy\u2014<br />\nbaseball sense. You can't win<br />\ngame on power alone: pitching<br />\nand defense are crucial. Home<br />\nruns might put people in the<br />\nseats, but they'll never win ball<br />\ngames\u2014and nobody goes to see<br />\na losing team.(You know that,<br />\nGeorge.) So start trading intelligently: get some pitchers<br />\nwho can pitch, give the Goose<br />\nsome help in the bullpen, get<br />\nsome players who can field as<br />\nwell as hit for average (Milwaukee, with all its incredible<br />\npower, had four .300 hitters),<br />\nand stop letting your prospects<br />\nget away. For the Yankees to<br />\nimprove, you need some smart<br />\ntrades and some smart purchases, not just plain buying<br />\nevery player in sight. Yes,<br />\nGeorge, there is such a thing as<br />\nthe \"Yankee tradition\"\u2014<br />\nsomething which loyal Yankee<br />\nfans hold dear to our hearts.<br />\nBut at the moment, the Yankees have lost that winning<br />\nspirit. It's up to you, George.<br />\nYou can bring the championship back to the Bronx, where<br />\nit belongs. You have the power.<br />\nMr. Steinbrenner, the Yankee<br />\nfans deserve a winner, and it's<br />\ntime they got it.<br />\n<br />\nBlast Nip New York Arrows<br />\nBY BRUCE PELTZER<br />\nThe Baltimore Blast virtually clinched the Eastern Division<br />\nChampionship Sunday with a<br />\n4-3 win over the defending<br />\nchampion New York Arrows.<br />\nThe Blasts victory gave them a<br />\none-game lead over Cleveland,<br />\nwho were 8-5 losers to Buffalo.<br />\nThe game-winner came off<br />\nthe head of Loyola gi aduate<br />\nNick Mangione with 5:24 left in<br />\nthe game, on a rebound of<br />\nPeter I3aralic's shot.

Some good<br />\npenalty kicking held off the Arrows, but Fred Grgurev put<br />\nNew York on the board with<br />\n<br />\njust 12 seconds left on the<br />\npenalty.

Just 26<br />\nseconds later, Mike Stankovic<br />\ntied the score at three.<br />\nAfter the goal by Mangione,<br />\nBaltimore played defensively<br />\nfor several minutes.

Hopkins won 5-2 on a<br />\ntwo-hitter by Steve Hand. The<br />\nJays had a nine-day rest<br />\ncourtesy of rain and sloppy<br />\nplaying conditions. Coach<br />\nBabb feels the layoff may have<br />\n<br />\nbeen a blessing in disguise \"as<br />\nwe got back to the basics and<br />\nhad a lot of extra batting practice that we sorely needed.\"<br />\nOne Blue Jay who didn't need<br />\nthe rest was Hand, a righthanded senior.

In addition, the budget provides for a<br />\ncontingency fund of $13,445.<br />\nSAC groups may, throughout<br />\nthe course of the year, ask the<br />\nSAC Executive Board to give<br />\nthem money from this contingency fund to pay for un-<br /><br />\nforeseen expenses. The total<br />\nbudget of the SAC, therefore,<br />\nis $113,420. This amount, which<br />\nwas alloted to the SAC by the<br />\nadministration, is a 7 percent<br />\n-increase from 'last year.<br />\nMost notably, this budget<br />\neliminates all funding for the<br />\nStudent Council Speaker Committee. Under the budget proposed by the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard, this committee had been<br />\ngiven $10(X). On the floor of the<br />\nSAC, however, Jim Salles proposed an amendment, which<br />\npassed, eliminating all funding<br />\nFor this committee.<br />\nWednesday night, several<br />\ncouncil members objected to<br />\nthis cut. Junior Class Representative and Student Council<br />\nVice-President-Elect Dolores<br />\nBulleri abstained on the passage<br />\nof the budget. The only council member not to vote for<br /><br />\nHarry Davis<br /><br />\npassage, Bulleri said she abstained because she did not like<br />\nthe cuts made to the Speaker<br />\nCommittee. Council Treasurer<br />\nHarry Davis also complained of<br />\nthe cut, and said that he would<br />\nlike to see \"structural changes\"<br />\nwhich would protect Student<br /><br />\nCouncil committees from \"political maneuvering.\" Saying he<br />\nwould pursue these changes<br />\nnext fall, Davis said he felt the<br />\nbest method would be to make<br />\nit more difficult to amend the<br />\nbudget on the floor of the SAC.<br />\nAt the SAC meeting on Tuesday, there had been an attempt<br />\nby several SAC groups to discard the Executive Board's<br />\nbudget, and implement a substitute budget. This budget<br />\nwould have eliminated funding<br />\nfor the Council Speaker Committee, the Martin Luther King<br />\nLectureship, the Kennedy Lectureship and the Council Concert Committee. The funding<br />\nfor the Concert Committee<br />\nwould have been combined<br />\nwith that of the Social Committee.

Not necessarily. Certainly,<br />\nmore attention to the undergraduate curriculum, Financial aid and housing is warranted. A major shift in emphasis, however,<br />\ntowards undergraduates at Hopkins if at the<br />\nexpense of the graduate program, may have<br />\nsome unintended and undesirable consequences. A shift towards undergraduates could<br />\nprove disastrous to the humanities and social<br />\nsciences at Hopkins, unless preventative steps<br />\nare taken.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is, and probably always<br />\nwill be, a graduate-oriented institution.<br />\nNevertheless, over the past ten to fifteen<br />\nyears, Hopkins' emphasis has shifted somewhat towards undergraduate education.<br />\nUndergraduate enrollment has increased<br />\ndramatically; the number of graduate students has declined slightly. While graduate<br />\nstudents have battled to attain financial aid<br />\nawards that are competitive with peer institutions, federal policies have made it easier for<br />\na greater number of Americans to afford a<br />\ncollege education at the undergraduate level.<br />\nRecent shifts in the economy and government philosophy may result in a crisis in<br />\nhigher education. As funds dwindle, institutions such as Hopkins may be forced to<br />\nmake difficult choices. Hopkins must decide<br />\nhow to balance undergraduates with graduates, the humanities and social sciences with<br />\nthe sciences. Already, the administration hass<br />\nprovided indications that it will try to offset declining federal monies for undergraduate financial aid with University<br />\nmoney. Such a proposition is not only commendable but essential to maintain equality.<br />\nof opportunity for a college education. This<br />\ntype of commitment is expensive, however,<br />\nand could conceivably be financed at the expense of any graduate aid currently dependent on University funds.<br />\nFurther decreases in graduate aid have<br />\nsevere implications for non-science departments at Hopkins. Many departments in the<br />\nsocial sciences and humanities depend on<br />\ngraduate students for their strength. The<br />\nHistory Department, for instance, is one of<br />\nthe strongest in the nation. Aside from<br />\nresearch, its primary function is to train<br />\ngraduate students. Undergraduates, however, can reap benefits by taking courses by<br />\npremier historians. Cutting back on graduate<br />\nprograms, thus, makes it more difficult for<br />\nundergraduates to receive a well-rounded,<br /><br />\nliberal arts education. The connection between undergraduate enrollment and graduate programs is most important when it<br />\ncomes to the issue of teaching positions.<br />\nMany graduate programs justify their request funds on the grounds that they need<br />\nteaching assistants to instruct undergraduates. Although the administration tries to<br />\navoid having undergraduate enrollment dictating support for the graduate program, the<br />\nfact remains that in all likelihood, it' there<br />\nare to be any further cuts in graduate aid,<br />\nthey will affect those departments that do<br />\nnot use the money for teaching positions.<br />\nThis puts departments such as Classics and<br />\nNear Eastern Studies in a very precarious<br />\nposition because very few undergrads take<br />\ncourses in these areas. Such departments,<br />\ntherefore, have little need for teaching positions. Unless admissions policies change,<br />\nteaching positions for graduate students will<br />\ncontinue to be available in the sciences,<br />\nbecause most Hopkins undergraduates take<br />\nmany science courses..<br />\nIf' the size of the undergraduate body remains the same in the midst of tough financial times, there are, nevertheless, several<br />\nways by which to avoid the declension of<br />\nliberal arts at Hopkins. The best but most<br />\ndifficult solution would entail changing the<br />\nimage of Hopkins in order to attract more<br />\nliberal arts majors. The recent acquisition of<br />\nthe Peabody Conservatory and the development of academic programs in Italy and<br />\nChina contribute to a shift in image. Yet as<br />\nlong as Hopkins Hospital and Med School are<br />\ninternationally renowned, Hopkins will continue to attract many science-oriented<br />\nundergraduates. A more feasible alternative<br />\nwould entail a restructuring of the<br />\nundergraduate curriculum that would require<br />\nstudents to pursue .a broader liberal arts<br />\neducation, thus, saving some social science<br />\nand humanities departments from death.<br />\nOf course, if the University's capital campaign is successful, there will be no reason<br />\nto worry; there will be enough money to support a strong graduate as well as undergraduate program, thus maintaining the<br />\nbalance of liberal arts versus sciences at<br />\nHopkins. Yet there is no guarantee that the<br />\nUniversity will be able to obtain the revenue<br />\nnecessary to fulfill all of its desires, and if<br />\nfunds decrease, difficult choices will have to<br />\nbe made. It is important to begin thinking<br />\nabout these choices and to understand some<br />\nof the not so obvious implications that some<br />\nof these choices entait.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nRisking Harm To Students To Make The Campus Attractive Is Inexcusable<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhat is the reason for the<br />\ndestruction of plants around<br />\nthe trees on campus? Why is<br />\npoison being used to remove<br />\nthem? Who makes the decision<br />\nto use potentially harmful<br />\nchemicals on campus?

The disadvantages of<br />\nthe action taken must logically<br />\noutweigh the advantages, since<br />\nthere is not an advantage to be<br />\ngained by removing greenery<br />\nfrom the bases of trees.<br />\nSincerely,<br /><br />\nMary Sophia Smith<br /><br />\nWe as undergraduates applaud the initial attempts of our<br />\nalumni (see last week's Letter to<br />\nthe Editor) to return rock music<br />\nto the Spring Fair. As currently enrolled students, however,<br />\nwe feel that more should be<br />\ndone. We believe that undergraduates should be able to examine the specific reasoning of<br />\nthe administration for the ban,<br />\nand then to formulate their own<br />\nresponses in order to initiate a<br />\nmore open discussion in planning the fair.<br />\nAs best we can imagine, these<br />\nare the administration's arguments.<br />\nI. Rock music brings a security risk to the fair. Two<br />\nyears ago a knife was pulled out<br />\non the Gilman Stage. However,<br />\nit should be remembered that<br />\nthe -knife was put away, without<br />\nan incident, following the request of a security guard. This<br />\nlone incident, which occurred<br />\ntwo years ago, is now the basis<br />\nof a universal policy banning<br />\nrock music. By this time they<br />\nhave created a walkie-talkie<br />\nequipped student security force,<br />\n. have beefed-up Hopkins security, restricted beer to one<br />\nfenced-in area, and have banned rock music. The combination of these measures makes as<br />\nmuch sense as using a tank to<br />\nclear a kitchen of roaches.<br />\n2. Rock music leads to<br />\nalcohol abuse. Again, new<br />\nmeasures have more than compensated for any potential problems. The drinking age has<br />\nbeen raised, and beer will be<br />\nrestricted to the President's<br />\nGarden (enclosed by a double<br />\nfence with a \"no-man's land\"<br />\nin between fences) with only<br />\none entrance. There will also be<br />\na strict enforcement of IDs at<br />\nthe entrance. With an adequate<br />\nsecurity system and a restriction<br />\non alcohol sales and use, it is<br />\nhard to believe that alcoholrelated problems would occur<br />\ndue to the presence of rock<br />\nbands at the fair. But perhaps<br />\nthe point is that these are not<br />\nthe real issues behind the administration's argument, for<br />\nthey have all been resolved. Instead, the administration\u2014a la<br /><br />\nJames Watt\u2014wants to keep<br />\nthose it sees as \"undesirables\"<br />\noff this campus, during the<br />\nSpring Fair and otherwise.<br />\nWho suffers the most from<br />\nthese policies'? The students of<br />\nHopkins. We must keep in<br />\nmind that the Spring Fair was<br />\ncreated to encourage more interaction between JHU and the<br />\ncommunity and we, as students, still feel the need for an<br />\nopen policy towards the community. Furthermore, by trying<br />\nto isolate the campus from the<br />\ncommunity, the administration<br />\nhas managed to ruin the fair for<br />\nits own students. With a little<br />\nbit of common sense and all of<br />\nthe restrictions already imposed on the fair, it should be<br />\npossible for students to enjoy<br />\none of the few things they have<br />\nin common: an appreciation of<br />\nrock music.<br />\nWith this goal in mind, we<br />\nwould like to make a few requests of the administration.<br />\nI. To publicly explain, in<br />\nclear and precise terms, their<br />\nargument against rock music.<br />\nThis should appear in next<br />\nweek's News-Letter. (After all,<br />\nhow can students respond intelligently to the administration's policies if they are not<br />\nallowed to know the reasons<br />\nbehind the policies'?)<br />\n2. At the minimum, to remove the ban barring Hopkins'<br />\nown student bands from performing at the Spring Fair.<br />\nThese students, who have paid<br />\nthousands of dollars to attend<br />\nthe University, should have the<br />\nright to share their skills and<br />\ntalents with fellow students.<br />\nThe fact is that the administration will not be able to bar<br />\nstudents from playing at their<br />\nown fair. Student musicians<br />\nwill surely appear, through an<br />\nunderground guerilla-musician's network, to provide<br />\nsolace for tired (and certainly<br />\nappreciative) ears, in the spots<br />\nyou would least expect and<br />\ntimes you would least imagine.<br />\nMelanie May '85<br />\nHelen McCreedy<br />\nLuis Cruz<br />\nPhillip Schmandt<br />\nMartin Yon<br />\nBrian Ferguson<br />\ncorn. on p.5<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nAndrew Hurley..................................................

I feel<br />\nawfully gassy. I've burped three<br />\ntimes since I got here two<br />\nminutes ago. I'm not really sure<br />\nwho brought me here. I think<br />\nit was a big, fat man who is<br />\nholding me too tightly. He also<br />\nlikes to throw me up in the air<br />\nand then catch me. He almost<br />\ndropped me one time but grabbed my feet just before my head<br />\nwas about to hit the concrete.<br />\nI'm sitting in the back of the<br />\nroom. Most of the people are<br />\nsitting in front of me. They<br />\ndon't look too nice. There's a<br />\nman all the way up front who<br />\nis standing behind a \u2022 stereo<br />\nspeaker.

They have<br />\nsincerely tried to be fair to all<br />\ngroups this year. It is unfortunate that Steve Levine, Grant<br />\nLally, Maureen Freed and<br />\nothers of their group have tried<br />\nto undermine their fine job.<br />\nAlthough their motives may<br />\nhave been noble, Mr. Levine<br />\net.al. made a travesty of the<br />\nbudgeting process of the SAC.<br />\nThis year, all SAC groups were<br />\nnot able to receive all of the<br />\nfunds which they requested for<br />\nthe 1983-84 school year. However, a few groups connected<br />\nwith Mr. Levine, Mr. Lally<br />\neta!. tried to profit by making<br />\ndeals with other groups so they<br />\ncould get the funds they<br />\nwanted.<br />\nAt the meetings, Mr. Levine<br />\nproposed an alternative budget.<br />\nIn this budget, Mr. Levine<br />\nclaimed that his group contacted \"most\" of the groups<br />\nasking for funds from the SAC<br />\nthis year. When confronted for<br />\na listing of the groups contacted, Mr. Levine objected<br />\nstating it was not pertinent to<br />\nthe issue. As I found out later,<br />\nthe groups which received an<br />\nincrease in the alternative budget were those that were contacted. The number of groups<br />\ncontacted, according to Maureen Freed, was 16. The number<br /><br />\nof SAC groups contacted that<br />\nwished funding from the SAC<br />\nin this total, was 15. The<br />\nnumber of SAC groups that<br />\nwished to be funded next year<br />\nby the SAC is 31. This is not a<br />\ndefinition of \"most\"!<br />\nWhen the question was raised again, Mr. Levine was also<br />\nasked how groups were decided to be contacted. He stated<br />\nthat it was based on the amount<br />\nthat they requested minus the<br />\namount they got and also if the<br />\ngroup received less funding<br />\nthan 1983. I then stated that the<br />\nOutdoors Club fit into this<br />\ncategory. Mr. Levine, confronted with the fact that the<br />\nOutdoors Club received the<br />\nthird highest figure by their<br />\ncalculations, entered into<br />\nnegotiations to stop the objections. They offered to increase<br />\nthe Outdoors Club appropriations by $500. This showed that<br />\nall they were interested in was<br />\nto pass their own budget for<br />\ntheir own profit and that they<br />\nwere not concerned with the<br />\nwelfare of other groups. They<br />\ndid not even ask what the Outdoors Club needed the additional funds for. So Maureen<br />\nFreed, Mr. Lally and Mr. Levine, this is what you term<br />\nfairness to SAC groups. Your<br />\ntactics are appalling. There are<br />\nno ethics involved. If you<br />\nthought the budget presented<br />\nby the SAC was so bad, why<br />\ndid you not just reject it?

Last week the News-Letter<br />\nprinted that she was Director,of<br />\nStudent Activities. In that same<br />\narticle, and in a later one, we<br />\nread that not only did she think<br />\nthat student groups shouldn't<br />\nask for (and to read between<br />\nthe lines, didn't deserve) extra<br />\nmoney for the next scholastic<br />\nyear, but then she decides that<br />\nstudents shouldn't have the<br />\ntype of music they want to hear<br />\nat a student-run activity. After<br />\nreading this, one might get the<br />\nimpression that her title should<br />\nbe<br />\nDisrupter of Student<br />\nActivities.<br />\nI acknowledge that all University budgets are tight this<br />\nyear, but so are student group<br />\nbudgets. Apparently, Mary Ellen Porter's Union Board budget is not tight. The Union<br />\nBoard, under her direction, has<br />\nbrought us such financial<br />\nfiascos as the Bahamas party,<br />\nand probably will do it again<br />\nnext year. Meanwhile, she has<br />\nthe audacity to insinuate that<br />\nstudent groups shouldn't get<br />\nmore money because, in light of<br />\none mismanaged event, the administration assumes that all<br />\nstudent groups are negligent.<br />\nNot only is the point of her<br />\nargument against more student<br />\nmoney blatantly false\u2014very<br />\nfew groups lose money\u2014but<br />\nwhy isn't part of her job to go<br />\nto the administration and let<br />\nthem know that the concert was<br />\none isolated incident? Why<br />\ndidn't she stick up for us, at<br />\nleast in public, instead of seizing the moment to take a slap<br />\nat all student groups?<br /><br />\nFrom her public declarations<br />\nto her insidious attempts to<br />\nhinder the Course Guide and<br />\nother groups, Mary Ellen Porter has tried hard to ignore<br />\nmany student groups. In light<br />\nof all this, I ask again: What is<br />\nMary Ellen Porter's job?<br /><br />\nSincerely,<br />\nTed Hayes<br /><br />\nman is talking. He looks like<br />\nthe man who brought me into<br />\nthe room. But he looks friendlier. I wonder if he'll give me a<br />\nsip of his Coke which is next to<br />\ntwo other cans of Coke.<br />\nIn front of the man, who is<br />\nfacing me, are people between<br />\nhe and I. Most people are closer<br />\nto him. They keep asking him<br />\nquestions. He answers them<br />\nquickly. When they talk back,<br />\nhe times their responses. And<br />\nwhen they ask questions about<br />\nmoney, he picks up a calculator<br />\nwhich is on top of the speaker.<br />\nSome of the numbers are large,<br />\nbut some are small.

I don't<br />\nlike smoke. Mommy says it's<br />\nbad for me. What they usually<br />\ndo is sit with their legs crossed<br />\nand blow the smoke into the<br />\nair. And it's a funny thing. As<br />\nsoon as they finish smoking<br />\none, they smoke another.<br />\nI'm beginning to drool. On<br />\nthe big, fat man's lap. He<br />\ndoesn't notice at first.

The museum, originally opened for permanent k iewing in 1953, is located on the site of _<br />\nmany \"firsts\" in America. From these grounds.<br />\nAmerica's first passenger and freight trains were<br />\ndispatched, and also here the nation's first depot<br />\nwas built. On this site, Peter Cooper, in 1830, constructed America's first locomoti\u2018e, the Tom<br />\nrhumb.

The museum and<br />\ngrounds underwent a $2 million renovation during<br />\nthe early 1970s, in preparation for the sesquicentennial celebration of the B&amp;O Railroad's founding in<br />\n1827.

The majority of the horses which race<br />\nat Pimlico are between three and eight years old,<br />\nand they will each race once every five to ten days,<br />\ndepending upon the time of season, their conditioning, and their age.<br />\nPimlico itself has an illustrious history. It first<br />\nopened on October 25, 1870, and after Saratoga,<br />\nis the second-oldest race track in the United States.<br />\nIt is owned and operated by the Maryland Jockey<br />\nClub, the nation's oldest sporting association.<br />\nPimlico is the home of the National Jockeys' Hall<br />\nof Fame and the Woodlawn Vase, billed as \"the<br />\nmost valuable trophy in American sports.\" The<br />\nvase, valued at over $750,000, is the Preakness<br />\ntrophy. Since 1953, a half-sized reproduction of the<br />\nvase has been awarded to the Preakness winner<br /><br />\nevery year.<br />\nIt is the Preakness, of course, for which Pimlico<br />\nis best known. The Preakness is the middle jewel<br />\nof the Triple Crown, three races held every year and<br />\nregarded as the best of the racing world. The other<br />\ntwo classics of the Friple Crown are the Kentucky<br />\nDerby and the Belmont Stakes. These races are<br />\nreserved for the premier three-year-olds in the land,<br />\nand have hosted all the great names in thoroughbred<br />\nhistory: Man O'War, Secretariat, Seattle Slew, Affirmed, Spectacular Bid and more.<br />\nIn recent years, the Preakness has become almost<br />\nas famous for its infield party as for its racing quality. Pimlico general manager Chick Lang contends<br />\nthat \"it's Woodstock, a family picnic, the Indy 500,<br />\nand a carnival all rolled into one.\" Infield attendance alone has grown from 12,000 in 1971 f o over<br />\n50,000 last year. \"You've got to be there when they<br />\n'pop' the gates at 9:00 to believe it,\" says Lang.<br />\n\"They carry scaffolding, homemade coolers of<br />\nevery description, grills, pieces of canvas, plywood,<br />\nand whatever they need for homemade construction. They have beach umbrellas, tents, blankets<br />\nand trash cans or wash tubs filled with ice and<br /><br />\ndrinks. Some use wheelbarrows, wagons, or shopping carts.\"<br />\nPimlico officials are not averse to the reputation<br />\nthat the Preakness infield has acquired. They bill<br />\nthe infield as the younger crowd's Preakness. If<br />\nsome of these younger fans catch the racing bug,<br />\nPimlico will benefit in the long run, explains Lang.<br />\nOtherwise,\"we promote the idea to come out and<br />\npicnic, and have fun.\"<br />\nPimlico, with its colorful 113-year tradition, has<br />\nachieved a position of admiration among racing<br />\nfans from Baltimore and beyond. From the prestige<br />\nof the Preakness to \"Cockey\" Johnson', from the<br />\nin ield party to the Woodlawn Vase, from that lonely 6:00 a.m. workout to the 1:00 post time, Pimlico<br />\nhas become a tradition rooted in the horse racing<br />\nhistory of America and the world.<br /><br />\nCorrection:<br />\nLast week's interview with Edward Albee<br />\nwas written by Todd Rosen.

Soon to come to this part Of the<br />\nmuseum, as a permanent display, are hundreds<br />\nmore model trains and a gargantuan '0' scale<br />\nlayout, all the gift of a generous man from Ohio.<br />\nThe fact that nearly all the displays and railroad<br />\nequipment are the generous donations of private individuals and corporations emphasizes how the<br />\nmuseum was established and is still run. The B&amp;O<br />\nMuseum has no funding ties to the city of<br />\nBaltimore\u2014its funding is almost entirely from the<br />\nB&amp;O Railroad, now part of the Chessie System.<br />\nMrs. Marian E.

Their main job is that<br />\nof the restoration of old trains, where their strength<br />\nand skills shine through. Upon completion of each<br />\nmajor restoration project, a special exhibit is created<br />\nwhich highlights the finished product of years of<br />\nlabor.<br />\nAfter returning to the main level of the museum,<br />\nthe visitor walks, with growing anticipation, toward<br />\nwhat is probably the greatest shrine of railroading<br />\ntoday\u2014the roundhouse, with its large central turntable.

These full-scale models<br />\nwere the vision and creation of Joseph G.<br />\nPangborn, the legendary PR man of the B&amp;O.<br /><br />\nThese<br />\nmodels, along with the<br />\nother restored engines, became, in the last<br />\ndecade of the 19th . cent urN ,<br />\npart of the largest industrial exhibit<br />\never mounted, at the Field Museum of<br />\nthe Columbian Exposition.

Mrs. Smith who,<br />\nalong with her staff, is completing this job, encouraged. anyone with a serious academic inquiry<br />\nabout railroads to contact her office. She noted that<br />\nmany times in the past she has had Hopkins<br />\nstudents do some phase of their research at the<br />\nmuseum.<br />\nMrs. Smith sees the museum as one that is constantly growing, thriving and searching out new<br />\nthings to accomplish. Part of this achievement rests<br />\non the B&amp;O Railroad, whose financial support is<br /><br />\ncritical,<br />\nand whose<br />\nleadership over<br />\nmany decades was in<br />\nry,<br />\nthe forefront of preserv/ife<br />\nri<br />\ning great examples of rail,<br />\nroading in America. The B&amp;O's<br />\n\"<br />\nstake in this past is unimaginable.<br />\nOften called the \"Railroad University of<br />\nAmerica,\" the B&amp;O was the first railroad to publish a timetable (May 23, 1830), the first to use a<br />\nbaggage car (1834), the first to place an electric<br />\nlocomotive in regular service (July 27, 1895), and<br />\nthe first to operate a completely air-conditioned<br />\ntrain (May 1931).<br />\nMrs. Smith sees the birth and development of the<br />\nmuseum as corresponding to Baltimore's Renaissance, and imparts to those who listen a strong and<br />\nhealthy \"Baltimore is Best\" feeling.<br />\nAt just $2.00 for adult admission, join rail buffs<br />\nand the just plain inquisitive from all across the<br />\ncountry, and visit the \"Railroad University\" of the<br />\npast and the growing showplace of railroading of<br />\nthe present.

An aged Antonio Salieri, et)<br />\ncomposer to .loseph II, relives his rivalr<br />\nwith the young genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart over the course of the long<br />\nevening before the dawn at which he will<br />\nattempt suicide. During the years 1781<br />\nto 1791, Salieri was a prosperous court<br />\nfigure, Mozart \"a vulgar, cackling upstart. Salieri's jealousy of Mozart's<br />\ntalents (Mozart transcribes onto paper<br />\ncomplete works he has fully orchestrated in his head) is not so much a byproduct of personal dislike, although<br />\nthat is present, but of a quarrel with<br />\nGod: why should Catholic Salieri, who<br />\nwants only to exalt the Lord with his<br />\ncompositions, have to suffer mediocrity when the irreligious, obscene Mozart<br />\npossesses such gifts?<br />\nThis is the central idea of Peter Shaffer's play, which under the direction of<br />\nPeter Hall runs through April 25 at the<br />\nMorris A. Mechanic Theatre. It is a<br />\ngood idea, but one botched in the telling. With nothing like the psychological<br /><br />\nresults is a work that jumps from one<br />\nscene to the next without taking the time<br />\nto develop satisfying dramaturgical<br />\nlinks.<br />\nTo criticize the play, though, is not<br />\nnecessarily to criticize the production.<br />\nThe staging is ornate yet simple, the<br />\ntnovement through time fluid and coherent. Mark Hamill plays Mozart competently, although betraying mannerisms reminiscent not of Luke Skywalker (surprise!) but of Tim Curry,<br />\nwho has played this part in at least one<br />\nother production.<br />\nJohn Wood, as Salieri, holds the<br />\nshow together. He makes seamless transitions between the old and the young<br />\nSalieri, and between great extremes in<br />\nemotion. He instills Salieri's plight with<br />\npoignance and believability, and adds to<br />\nthe irony of the play's last few scenes<br />\ntautness of EqIIIIS, another of Shaffer's so bad if the scene in which it Occurs (after the suicide attempt) with his<br />\nworks, the key events in Salieri's at- weren't -the climax of the conflict and carefully inflected readings.<br />\nAmadeus is a play about cosmic intempted destruction of Mozart unfold the supposed cause (if only indirectly)<br />\njustice,<br />\nof<br />\nthe damnable inscrutability of a<br />\ninMozart's<br />\nFor<br />\ndeath.<br />\nnebulously.<br />\nhaphazardly and<br />\nthat<br />\nGod<br />\nis<br />\nwho<br />\nplay<br />\ndispenses his gifts without<br />\nThe<br />\nthat<br />\nSalieri<br />\nproblem<br />\nthe<br />\nwith<br />\nto<br />\nrevealed<br />\nstance, it is<br />\nMozart is haunted by the ghost of his Salieri actually has too little to do with regard for personal morality.

This year's<br />\nsquad is a combination of<br />\nyouth and experience, with captain Andrew Brief being the<br />\nlone senior. Brief is a four-year<br />\nstarter, and is currently playing<br />\nnumber-three singles. There is<br />\nalso just one freshman on the<br />\nvarsity\u2014Kenny Lee\u2014who Santamaria described as his<br />\n\"doubles specialist.\" Santamaria predict that Lee will<br />\nalso succeed in singles play in<br />\nthe future.<br />\nAt number-one singles is<br />\njunior Ivor Longo, who played<br />\nat number two last season.<br />\n\"Ivor improved tremendously<br />\nover the summer, and is coining along real well,\" said Santamaria. Sophomore Alex Tang<br />\nis currently at number-two<br />\nsingles. \"Alex also improved a<br />\nlot over the summer,\" said San-<br /><br />\nIvor Longo<br />\ntamaria. \"He was erratic as a<br /><br />\nrespectively.

Rounding out the team<br />\nare juniors Doug Baruch and<br />\nSandy Teng, and sophomore<br />\nDave Gibbs.<br />\nThe team has played extremely well, with only a tough<br />\nloss to UMBC blemishing their<br /><br />\nrecord. Among the team's five<br />\nvictories was an amazing 5-4<br />\nwin over always tough Drew<br />\nUniversity, a team that has<br />\nbeaten Hopkins the last two<br />\nyears. \"We really didn't expect<br />\nto win,\" said Santamaria. \"It<br />\nwas an excellent win for us.\" In<br />\nthe squad's most recent match<br />\nto date, they outscored Western<br />\nMaryland by a 5-1 margin.<br />\nCoach Santamaria already<br />\nfeels that this year's team is better than last year's edition.<br />\n\"We have a better attitude this<br />\nyear,\" he explained. \"We're<br />\nreally coming together as a<br />\nteam. There's no animosity between the players. They're all<br />\nreally pulling for each otner out<br />\nthere, and that's what it's all<br />\nabout.\"<br />\nThe team's depth has also<br />\nimproved. \"I wouldn't say we<br />\nhave one real strong player,\"<br />\nsaid Santamaria. \"We have<br />\nstrength all through our<br />\nlineup\u2014that's our strength.\"<br />\nAside from his 13-3 prediction, Santamaria sees many<br />\nother positive things happening<br />\nthis season.

So start trading intelligently: get some pitchers<br />\nwho can pitch, give the Goose<br />\nsome help in the bullpen, get<br />\nsome players who can field as<br />\nwell as hit for average (Milwaukee, with all its incredible<br />\npower, had four .300 hitters),<br />\nand stop letting your prospects<br />\nget away. For the Yankees to<br />\nimprove, you need some smart<br />\ntrades and some smart purchases, not just plain buying<br />\nevery player in sight.
