C. Herbert<br />\nBaxley, '19, star inhome of the<br />\nteam this spring, was elected.<br />\nThis is Baxley's third year on the<br />\nlacrosse squad, he having won his<br />\nH. A. A. in lacrosse during his<br />\nfreshman year.<br />\nThe party as a whole was a<br />\ngreat success; the dinner went all<br />\nthe way from soup to coffee\u2014a<br />\nnecessity for all lacrosse banquets<br />\nin order to keep the men awake<br />\nduring Bill Schmeisser's speech,<br />\naccording to Reaney Wolfe\u2014and<br />\nthe speeches were excellent. Captain Schmidt presided, of course,<br />\nand called on Dr. Abercrombie,<br />\nformer captain and member of five<br />\nHopkins lacrosse teams, for the<br />\nfirst speech. Dr. Abercrombie<br />\nspoke of the great fight all the<br />\nVarsity teams have made this year<br />\nunder the Most trying conditions,<br />\ncomplimented the team on bringing back the championship to Hopkins, and told them that all Hopkins men were proud of them.<br />\nThe next speech was from<br />\n\"Fritz\" Sadtler, who told some of<br />\nthe experiences of a freshman on<br />\nthe team, his remarks being supplemented by Joe Brennan, the<br />\nother fresh H man. The other<br />\nmembers of the team and the manager were then called on in their<br />\nturn, and told of their adventures<br />\nin New York during the recent<br />\nCrescent trip, or started the ball<br />\nrolling to beat Lehigh next year<br />\n\"on their own back-lot.\" The hit of<br />\nthe evening was undoubtedly Tiff<br />\nWilliams, who proved himself a<br />\ntrue comedian in giving an account of his experiences with<br />\n\"Rube\" Jarrett at Coney Island<br />\nand in the \"Big City.\" Graduate<br />\nManager Corner announced that<br />\nthe sweaters had been ordered and<br />\nwould arrive at an early date, and<br />\ncongratulated the team on its<br />\ncoaches and the wonderful work<br />\nthey have done for the team.<br />\nCaptain Schmidt then gave a<br />\nsplendid tribute to Alex Wolfe,<br />\ncaptain of the team this year<br />\nuntil he enlisted in the Aviation<br />\nservice. He told of the letters he<br />\nhad received from Alex during the<br />\n<br />\nThe Omicron Delta Kappa held<br />\nits final meeting of the year last<br />\nTuesday evening at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club. The members of<br />\nthe faculty present were Dean<br />\nBrush, Dr. French, and Major<br />\nGuild.<br />\nThe only elections that took<br />\nplace were those for the offices of<br />\nVice-President and SecretaryTreasurer. Beverly Smith, Jr.,<br />\nwho will be a Senior next year,<br />\nwill hold the former office, and<br />\nAylett B. Coleman, Jr., the latter<br />\nAn important topic of discussion was the question of conflict<br />\nbetween drill and football practice next year. A plan was suggested in which drills would be<br />\nheld every day from 12:30 to 1:30,<br />\nlunch would be eaten until 2:00,<br />\nand laboratories would be open<br />\nfrom 2:00 until 5.00.<br />\nIn connection with the honor<br />\nsystem, it was proposed that all<br />\ncommunication in examination<br />\nrooms be included with the<br />\nthings prohibited in the pledge.<br />\nThe matter of interesting men<br />\nof the Maryland high schools in<br />\ncoming to Hopkins was brought<br />\nup. Although no speakers have<br />\nbeen sent to the prep schools so<br />\nfar, it is very probable that Dean<br />\nBrush and Major Guild will make<br />\na few tours before the end of the<br />\nterm.<br />\nMajor Guild outlined a plan,<br />\nwhich, if followed sometimes,<br />\nwould undoubtedly arouse much<br />\noutside interest in the Battalion<br />\nand likewise in the University.<br />\nIt was that of organizing the Battalion as a mounted signal corps<br />\nunit. This could probably not be<br />\ndone, however, until after the war.<br />\n<br />\nJudging from reports, the Faculty will accomplish much during the summer vacation in their<br />\nuntiring efforts to serve our country in their best capacity. The<br />\nfollowing faculty members have<br />\ndefinitely decided upon their summer work:<br />\nSeveral members of the faculty<br />\nwill complete some of the tasks<br />\nthat they have put off until summer. Dean Murray P. Brush will<br />\nspend the vacation at Rome, N.<br />\nY.; Dr. John C. French at Blue<br />\nRidge Summitt, Pa.; and Dr.<br />\nHerbert E. Greene at Cape Cod,<br />\nMass.<br />\nDr. Herbert S. Jennings will do<br />\nresearch work at the University.<br />\nDr. Duncan S. Johnson will,<br />\nstudy the problem of diseases of<br />\nwheat. He will make his investigations in Alabama, and in the<br />\nStates north of it.<br />\nDr. Caswell Grave will be in<br />\nservice in the Ordnance Department, in New Jersey.<br />\nDr. Jacob Hollander will spend<br />\nthe summer in Baltimore.<br />\nDr. C. K. Swartz will be engaged this summer in government<br />\ngeological research in Maryland.<br />\nDr. Greenbaum has volunteered<br />\nto make official' translations for<br />\nthe Government. He will continue his own research work until called into service.<br />\nDr. Robinson will spend the<br />\nsummer making literary productions and doing archeological investigation. He will spend part<br />\nof the summer in New England.<br />\nDr. C. L.

In the second<br />\nround Webb smashed out a fly to<br />\ncenter which went past Bratt's<br />\nhead with such a breeze that it<br />\nblew him over; while Webb, in<br />\nthe meantime, circled the sacks<br />\nfor a homer. Winn, the '20<br />\npitcher, in avoiding being caught<br />\noff second in the fifth, spiked<br />\nhimself, breaking his ankle. Litman finished for him, and pitched<br />\nsome - nifty ball. The umpires<br />\ngave some raw decisions, calling<br />\nGreenbaum safe at home in the<br />\nfourth when he was a yard off,<br />\nmaking Fries safe at first in the<br />\neighth instead of being out by<br />\nthree feet, and putting Lederer<br />\nout at third in the ninth.<br />\nThe lacrosse game was more or<br />\nless a scramble. The Freshmen<br />\nwere able to land 2 only in the<br />\nfirst half and none in the second.<br />\nThe Sophs rounded in about 12<br />\ntowards the end, their entire defense, including Dougherty, left<br />\ntheir positions and tried shooting<br />\ngoals, while Ferdy Meyer, the<br />\n\"field judge,\" curled up in the net<br />\nand 'went to sleep.<br />\nThe scores:<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 2, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nHullabaloo Not Ready Till June 15.<br />\n<br />\nOwing to the shortage of labor,<br />\nthe \"Hullabaloo\" will not be issued to the subscribers until June<br />\nthe fifteenth.

Untimely<br />\ninterference was effectually prevented by keeping the place a<br />\ndark secret, from all but the committee, until an hour before it<br />\nstarted. When the meeting was<br />\ncalled to order, it was found that<br />\nover fifty were present, including<br />\nthe guest of honor.<br />\nAs in all the gatherings of the<br />\ngreat, the first thing done was<br />\nthe taking of the flash-light photograph, copies of which will be<br />\nsoon on sale. (This should be in<br />\ngreat demand, as a prominent<br />\nfeature is the handsome figure of<br />\nthe guest of honor). A rush was<br />\nthen made for the Hooverized refreshments. The crowd next sat<br />\ndown in a large circle and \"lit<br />\nup.\" Addresses were made by the<br />\nguest of honor, President Carey,<br />\nVice-President Marcuse, Secretary<br />\nHeiner, Treasurer Pegram, the<br />\nchairman of the Pin Committee<br />\nand the captains and managers of<br />\nthe class athletic teams. Aesthetic<br />\ndancing and stories of Frederick<br />\nwere some of the further sources<br />\nof enjoyment. The evening wound<br />\nup with the singing of various<br />\ncollege and other songs by the entire chorus, and a snake dance by<br />\nthe same.

He complimented especially those men who were shifted<br />\nfrom defense to new positions on<br />\nthe attack early in the season, and<br />\nthose men who sat on the bench<br />\nas reserves during a great part of<br />\nthe games. There are no first and<br />\nsecond string men on the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team, he said, but just<br />\na great combination, all working<br />\ntogether for the success of the<br />\nteam.<br />\nFather Bill Schmeisser made<br />\nthe final speech, and it was a new<br />\none. He let the team on to some<br />\nof the coaching secrets he and<br />\nReaney have used during this and<br />\nformer years.

Since this camp<br />\nhas been used before for the same<br />\npurposes, the equipment and the<br />\nconditions of the camp will be<br />\nthe best. The training will be<br />\nover on July 3\u2014just a month<br />\nafter it began.

Capt. \"Dick\" Benson started off like a house afire gathering<br />\nfive hits in the first two games, but then took a slump and failed to<br />\nconnect safely with the ball for the remainder of the season. Webb,<br />\nwith his consistent hitting, had things all his own way until Jack<br />\nJones broke into the game in place of Rogers. His first time at bat<br />\nthe little third-sacker smashed out a homer to left. He continued<br />\nclouting the pill, until, in the Catholic University game, he tied<br />\nWebb with a double. However, he lost his eye in the Army battle,<br />\nand, owing to his small number of trips to the plate, his percentage<br />\ndropped. Bloomsburg started off poorly, but proved to be a real dark<br />\nhorse, being Webb's sole competitor at the finish. Had the season<br />\ncontinued much longer it is a question as to who would have emerged<br />\non top. Larry Littman also starred with the stick.<br />\nWebb, besides carrying off the batting average, leads in the runscoring and extra-base hitting. Benson and Jones tied for stolen<br />\nbases.<br />\nIn fielding Benson is in a class by himself. During the entire<br />\nseason behind the bat, he made 54 putouts and 17 assists without a<br />\nsingle miscue. Moriarty was also in the 1.000 class, catching six hard<br />\nflies. Purcell managed himself well in the field, chalking up to his<br />\ncredit 84 putouts and letting four slip by. him, while Sickel tied him<br />\nwith 17 putouts, 4 assists and 1 error.<br />\nWelliver carried off the pitching honors, working exceptionally<br />\nwell in every contest but the Holy Cross game, which was his debut<br />\non the mound.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that nearly the entire team will return<br />\nnext year, and it is expected that they will acquit themselves well<br />\nnext season.<br />\nThe batting, pitching and fielding averages follow:<br />\nBATTING AVERAGES OF THE JOHNS HOPKINS BASEBALL TEAM.<br />\nTwo- ThreeSaulAt<br />\nBase.

May, 1917, the<br />\nForeign Service Committee of the<br />\nNational Research Council, found<br />\nitself at Chalons on the Marne,<br />\non a visit to the French front.<br />\nThe weather was beautiful, the<br />\nflowering shrubs and trees were in<br />\nfull bloom. The guns in actioh<br />\na few miles to the north were not<br />\naudible, and to the casual view<br />\nthe place seemed very much like<br />\na French garrison town in time of<br />\npeace. In the afternoon of the<br />\nday of our arrival, we went by<br />\nautomobiles to see the front lines.<br />\nAs we drove along the fine French<br />\nroads, through a fairly level country, we passed many lories moving<br />\nforward or to the rear; here and<br />\nthere we saw a camp of horses, or<br />\na park of supply wagons; occasionally a group of soldiers would<br />\nsaunter by, usually carrying picks<br />\nor spades, rifles being conspicuously absent. Now and then an<br />\nautomobile carrying officers, or a<br />\nman on motorcycle, would dash<br />\nby at a break-neck pace; but the<br />\ncountry seemed peaceful.<br />\nThe first indication of our approach to the front lines, was<br />\nsight of a row of captive observation balloons; they were placed<br />\nabout three miles behind the front<br />\nand three or four miles apart;<br />\nand thus, from a distance, marked<br />\nthe position of the lines. Sometimes six or eight were visible at<br />\nonce. As we approached, the distant booming of cannon could be<br />\nheard; but this section was inactive at the time of our visit, and<br />\nthe firing was not rapid. We left<br />\nthe automobiles and went to an<br />\nobservation post, which was placed<br />\nat the edge of a wood, so concealed by blanches as to be invisible at a small distance. From<br />\nthis point we could look over the<br />\nlines a short mile ahead. It was<br />\nan interesting and surprising<br />\nsight: a broad, very gently rolling<br />\ncountry, with patches of wood<br />\nhere and there, with the grass gone<br />\nfrom the part near the trenches,<br />\nwhich, in this region, were not<br />\n'very easily distinguished. Behind<br />\nus was the row of French captive<br />\nballoons, and at a greater distance<br />\nin front the enemy balloons; here<br />\nand there overhead an aeroplane<br />\nfloated in the sky, the noise of its<br />\nengine distinctly audible; frequently we would hear the sound<br />\nof a bursting shell and see the<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nExtracts From \"Hank\" Chalmer's Letters.<br />\n\"Hank\" is now with the Y.

He will ever be<br />\nremembered as a Hopkins all-around<br />\nman, and for his genial disposition.<br />\nThe following are extracts from his<br />\nletters:<br />\n<br />\n\"If things work out as I expect,<br />\nI shall be assigned to a dugout<br />\non tire French front working with<br />\nthe French soldiers. There has<br />\nbeen a call for volunteers for these<br />\nposts, because they can't send a<br />\nman there against his will; so, I<br />\nvolunteered, and they think I shall<br />\nbe accepted. If I get the job it<br />\nwill put me on the fighting line<br />\nwith the most marvelous opportunity for service I have had.<br />\nThe French people are wonderful,<br />\nand I hope I may be able to help<br />\nthem in their courageous fight.<br />\nThey say that we can render no<br />\nmore important service than our<br />\nwork among the French.\"<br />\n\"I am now only about twenty<br />\nmiles from the front, and there is<br />\nso much snow that it is impossible<br />\nto proceed at once to my Foyer.<br />\nIt is hard to get to, anyway, and,<br />\nespecially so, with two feet of<br />\nsnow on the ground. I shall stay<br />\nwhere I am today and go on again<br />\ntomorrow. Last night I slept in<br />\na room having one pane of glass,<br />\nthe other openings were covered<br />\nwith thin gauze. The mirror in<br />\nthe room had a hole in the side<br />\nand there was a hole in the wall.<br />\nThe shutters and ceiling were<br />\nscarred with holes. All this<br />\nwreckage was done by bombs.\"<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n\"I am in the midst of things. I<br />\ngot up at five o'clock to take a<br />\ntrain for my post.

It seems to<br />\nme that when we got organized,<br />\nafter the first few weeks, we have<br />\nhad a splendid spirit. Certainly<br />\nthe various athletic teams cannot<br />\nkick about the Freshmen not being well represented on them. To<br />\nthe football squad, we gave Carey<br />\nand Jones, and many others,<br />\nwhose spirit was none the less<br />\ngood, even if their opportunities<br />\nwere less great. Baseball stars<br />\nfrom the class of '21 were Weillye; Webb and J. Jones. Track<br />\nhad Mulliken and Van Ness. On<br />\nthe lacrosse team were Brennan<br />\nand Sadtler. Besides the men<br />\nnamed, there were many others<br />\nwho came out and gave of their<br />\nbest, that Hopkins might be successful in the field of sports. Our<br />\nclass, as well as the University,<br />\nis deeply grateful to them.<br />\nIn other things, too, the Freshmen have maintained a fine spirit.<br />\nThe few,regulations set down for<br />\nthem, during the first term were<br />\nvery well adhered to. Altogether,<br />\nthe class promises to be Ole to<br />\nmaintain, with honor to itself, the<br />\ntraditions of the University.<br />\nI look back \u2022upon the college<br />\nyear, now ending, as one of the<br />\nhappiest of my life, and as I look<br />\nforward to next year, I feel considerably saddened, when I think<br />\nof the s changes that will have<br />\ntaken place, of the students who<br />\nwill not return, and, perhaps, I<br />\nmyself will not be here. If this<br />\nlast should be the case, I want to<br />\nthank the professors for their fairness to me in my studies, and to<br />\nask the students to join me in a<br />\ngood, old Hullabaloo for Hopkins.<br />\nFRESHMAN.<br />\nConcerning the Employment Bureau.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nSir\u2014We have at the University<br />\nhere, although many students may<br />\nnot know it, an Employment Bu-<br />\n<br />\nThe Physics II Lab.<br />\n(An Extract from the Will of those<br />\nstudents finishing Physics II.)<br />\n* * * And the little Place<br />\nUp under the Roof of the M.

Charles Street, Baltimore<br />\nStudents Admitted at any Time<br />\n<br />\nsmoke and earth thrown up where<br />\nit had struck; once a fire burst<br />\nout where a dump of fusees had<br />\nbeen struck; but there was a general suggestion of peacefulness<br />\nover the country, and, strain our<br />\neyes as we might, not a soldier<br />\nwas visible; we looked through<br />\nthe powerful glasses at the observation post\u2014not a man to be<br />\nseen; the place seemed deserted.<br />\nBut well we knew that thousands<br />\nof men were in the trenches or in<br />\nthe dugouts within a short distance of us, paying the price of<br />\neternal vigilance that liberty<br />\nmight be saved. Death, from an<br />\ninvisible source, hovered about;<br />\nand the officers warned us that<br />\nif we exposed ourselves to view<br />\na German shell was likely soon to<br />\nland among us. This lesson was<br />\ntaught us in a very decisive way<br />\na few days later at Fort Douaumont near Verdun. After seeing<br />\nthe various underground passages,<br />\n\u2022 we had gone on top to look about.<br />\nAs near Chalons the country<br />\nlooked peaceful and deserted. A<br />\nFrench 75, so camouflaged that it<br />\nwas hardly visible at a distance<br />\nof 50 yards, barked sharply from<br />\ntime to time, as tho' to indicate<br />\nthat the fortress was not open to<br />\nstrangers. We stayed but a few<br />\nminutes, and had scarcely gotten<br />\nunder shelter, when, with a loud<br />\nexplosion, a German 77 landed<br />\nwhere we had been sitting, followed ten or fifteen seconds later<br />\nby a second. It was probably<br />\nsport to the German gunners, but<br />\nthey didn't see us again.<br />\nIt was absorbing to watch the<br />\nreconnoitering aeroplanes. They<br />\nswept majestically through the<br />\nair like great soaring buzzards.<br />\nAs we looked, a black splotch<br />\nwould suddenly appear in the air<br />\nin the neighborhood of a plane;<br />\nthen another, and another, until<br />\neight or ten could be seem. They<br />\nmarked the bursting of the antiaircraft shells. Gradually they<br />\ndissolved and disappeared, and the<br />\naeroplane sailed on undisturbed,<br />\nseemingly contemptuous of the efforts to bring it down.<br />\nAs a<br />\nfact, very few are destroyed in<br />\nthis way.<br />\nThe battle field about Douaumont was one vast collection of<br />\nshell holes; from a distance the<br />\nhill looks as though it had been<br />\ntrampled over by great herds; but<br />\na nearer view shows that the soil<br />\nhas all been overturned and the<br />\nformerly smooth surface is now<br />\nmerely a collection of intersecting<br />\nshell holes. Not a foot of the<br />\noriginal surface remains. The<br />\nFrench alone fired 360,000 shells<br />\nin one day when they retook the<br />\nfortress. It was gruesome sight;<br />\ncartridges, broken guns,fragments<br />\nof shells old accoutrements, lay<br />\nscattered<br />\n'about. Some shell holes<br />\ncontained rain water stained a<br />\ndeep red. An arm, a foot, or<br />\nlarger parts of bodies could be<br />\n<br />\nseen in places projecting from the<br />\nsides of the holes; and there was<br />\na stench that pervaded the whole<br />\nplace. There must be thousands<br />\nof bodies covered up in the ground<br />\non this hill. In the immediate<br />\nneighborhood of Fort Douaumont,<br />\nthough they had been clearing up<br />\nfor several months, remains were<br />\nstill being uncovered. We found<br />\nthe same general conditions at<br />\nVimy Ridge; the ground was so<br />\ntorn by shells, that the former<br />\nGerman trenches were scarcely<br />\nrecognizable.<br />\nIn our drives across the country, we passed many villages in<br />\nutter ruin. Some had been destroyed in the natural course of<br />\nbattles, others in sheer wantonness. The Kaiser is lately reported to have congratulated the<br />\npeople of Aix-la-Chapelle that<br />\ntheir country had not suffered the<br />\nfate of northern France. But<br />\nwhat can be said of a government<br />\nthat, for its own advantage, is<br />\nwilling to inflict such disaster on<br />\na neighbor and be complaisant because they have been spared? We<br />\nwant no German peace. It is to<br />\nbe hoped that the Allies may obtain so complete. a victory that<br />\nthey will be able to hold the German government strictly responsible for all it has done.

A. in lacrosse during his<br />\nfreshman year.<br />\nThe party as a whole was a<br />\ngreat success; the dinner went all<br />\nthe way from soup to coffee\u2014a<br />\nnecessity for all lacrosse banquets<br />\nin order to keep the men awake<br />\nduring Bill Schmeisser's speech,<br />\naccording to Reaney Wolfe\u2014and<br />\nthe speeches were excellent. Captain Schmidt presided, of course,<br />\nand called on Dr. Abercrombie,<br />\nformer captain and member of five<br />\nHopkins lacrosse teams, for the<br />\nfirst speech. Dr. Abercrombie<br />\nspoke of the great fight all the<br />\nVarsity teams have made this year<br />\nunder the Most trying conditions,<br />\ncomplimented the team on bringing back the championship to Hopkins, and told them that all Hopkins men were proud of them.<br />\nThe next speech was from<br />\n\"Fritz\" Sadtler, who told some of<br />\nthe experiences of a freshman on<br />\nthe team, his remarks being supplemented by Joe Brennan, the<br />\nother fresh H man. The other<br />\nmembers of the team and the manager were then called on in their<br />\nturn, and told of their adventures<br />\nin New York during the recent<br />\nCrescent trip, or started the ball<br />\nrolling to beat Lehigh next year<br />\n\"on their own back-lot.\" The hit of<br />\nthe evening was undoubtedly Tiff<br />\nWilliams, who proved himself a<br />\ntrue comedian in giving an account of his experiences with<br />\n\"Rube\" Jarrett at Coney Island<br />\nand in the \"Big City.\" Graduate<br />\nManager Corner announced that<br />\nthe sweaters had been ordered and<br />\nwould arrive at an early date, and<br />\ncongratulated the team on its<br />\ncoaches and the wonderful work<br />\nthey have done for the team.<br />\nCaptain Schmidt then gave a<br />\nsplendid tribute to Alex Wolfe,<br />\ncaptain of the team this year<br />\nuntil he enlisted in the Aviation<br />\nservice. He told of the letters he<br />\nhad received from Alex during the<br /><br />\nThe Omicron Delta Kappa held<br />\nits final meeting of the year last<br />\nTuesday evening at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club. The members of<br />\nthe faculty present were Dean<br />\nBrush, Dr. French, and Major<br />\nGuild.<br />\nThe only elections that took<br />\nplace were those for the offices of<br />\nVice-President and SecretaryTreasurer. Beverly Smith, Jr.,<br />\nwho will be a Senior next year,<br />\nwill hold the former office, and<br />\nAylett B. Coleman, Jr., the latter<br />\nAn important topic of discussion was the question of conflict<br />\nbetween drill and football practice next year. A plan was suggested in which drills would be<br />\nheld every day from 12:30 to 1:30,<br />\nlunch would be eaten until 2:00,<br />\nand laboratories would be open<br />\nfrom 2:00 until 5.00.<br />\nIn connection with the honor<br />\nsystem, it was proposed that all<br />\ncommunication in examination<br />\nrooms be included with the<br />\nthings prohibited in the pledge.<br />\nThe matter of interesting men<br />\nof the Maryland high schools in<br />\ncoming to Hopkins was brought<br />\nup. Although no speakers have<br />\nbeen sent to the prep schools so<br />\nfar, it is very probable that Dean<br />\nBrush and Major Guild will make<br />\na few tours before the end of the<br />\nterm.<br />\nMajor Guild outlined a plan,<br />\nwhich, if followed sometimes,<br />\nwould undoubtedly arouse much<br />\noutside interest in the Battalion<br />\nand likewise in the University.<br />\nIt was that of organizing the Battalion as a mounted signal corps<br />\nunit. This could probably not be<br />\ndone, however, until after the war.<br /><br />\nJudging from reports, the Faculty will accomplish much during the summer vacation in their<br />\nuntiring efforts to serve our country in their best capacity. The<br />\nfollowing faculty members have<br />\ndefinitely decided upon their summer work:<br />\nSeveral members of the faculty<br />\nwill complete some of the tasks<br />\nthat they have put off until summer. Dean Murray P. Brush will<br />\nspend the vacation at Rome, N.<br />\nY.; Dr. John C. French at Blue<br />\nRidge Summitt, Pa.; and Dr.<br />\nHerbert E. Greene at Cape Cod,<br />\nMass.<br />\nDr. Herbert S. Jennings will do<br />\nresearch work at the University.<br />\nDr. Duncan S. Johnson will,<br />\nstudy the problem of diseases of<br />\nwheat. He will make his investigations in Alabama, and in the<br />\nStates north of it.<br />\nDr. Caswell Grave will be in<br />\nservice in the Ordnance Department, in New Jersey.<br />\nDr. Jacob Hollander will spend<br />\nthe summer in Baltimore.<br />\nDr. C. K. Swartz will be engaged this summer in government<br />\ngeological research in Maryland.<br />\nDr. Greenbaum has volunteered<br />\nto make official' translations for<br />\nthe Government. He will continue his own research work until called into service.<br />\nDr. Robinson will spend the<br />\nsummer making literary productions and doing archeological investigation. He will spend part<br />\nof the summer in New England.<br />\nDr. C. L. Powell will probably<br />\nspend the summer working in the<br />\nRed Cross.<br />\nDr. Greene will spend most of<br />\nthe summer at his home at Cape<br />\nCod.<br />\nDr. William Kurrelmeyer will<br />\ndo farming on the campus.<br />\nDr. Ethan A. Andrews will<br />\nspend most of his time in the<br />\nbiological laboratory.<br />\nA large number of instructors<br />\nwill teach in ,the summer school,<br />\nwhich, opens here July the ninth<br />\nand closes August the sixteenth.<br />\nDr. Edward F.

In the second<br />\nround Webb smashed out a fly to<br />\ncenter which went past Bratt's<br />\nhead with such a breeze that it<br />\nblew him over; while Webb, in<br />\nthe meantime, circled the sacks<br />\nfor a homer. Winn, the '20<br />\npitcher, in avoiding being caught<br />\noff second in the fifth, spiked<br />\nhimself, breaking his ankle. Litman finished for him, and pitched<br />\nsome - nifty ball. The umpires<br />\ngave some raw decisions, calling<br />\nGreenbaum safe at home in the<br />\nfourth when he was a yard off,<br />\nmaking Fries safe at first in the<br />\neighth instead of being out by<br />\nthree feet, and putting Lederer<br />\nout at third in the ninth.<br />\nThe lacrosse game was more or<br />\nless a scramble. The Freshmen<br />\nwere able to land 2 only in the<br />\nfirst half and none in the second.<br />\nThe Sophs rounded in about 12<br />\ntowards the end, their entire defense, including Dougherty, left<br />\ntheir positions and tried shooting<br />\ngoals, while Ferdy Meyer, the<br />\n\"field judge,\" curled up in the net<br />\nand 'went to sleep.<br />\nThe scores:<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 2, col. 3)<br /><br />\nHullabaloo Not Ready Till June 15.<br /><br />\nOwing to the shortage of labor,<br />\nthe \"Hullabaloo\" will not be issued to the subscribers until June<br />\nthe fifteenth.

Untimely<br />\ninterference was effectually prevented by keeping the place a<br />\ndark secret, from all but the committee, until an hour before it<br />\nstarted. When the meeting was<br />\ncalled to order, it was found that<br />\nover fifty were present, including<br />\nthe guest of honor.<br />\nAs in all the gatherings of the<br />\ngreat, the first thing done was<br />\nthe taking of the flash-light photograph, copies of which will be<br />\nsoon on sale. (This should be in<br />\ngreat demand, as a prominent<br />\nfeature is the handsome figure of<br />\nthe guest of honor). A rush was<br />\nthen made for the Hooverized refreshments. The crowd next sat<br />\ndown in a large circle and \"lit<br />\nup.\" Addresses were made by the<br />\nguest of honor, President Carey,<br />\nVice-President Marcuse, Secretary<br />\nHeiner, Treasurer Pegram, the<br />\nchairman of the Pin Committee<br />\nand the captains and managers of<br />\nthe class athletic teams. Aesthetic<br />\ndancing and stories of Frederick<br />\nwere some of the further sources<br />\nof enjoyment. The evening wound<br />\nup with the singing of various<br />\ncollege and other songs by the entire chorus, and a snake dance by<br />\nthe same.

He complimented especially those men who were shifted<br />\nfrom defense to new positions on<br />\nthe attack early in the season, and<br />\nthose men who sat on the bench<br />\nas reserves during a great part of<br />\nthe games. There are no first and<br />\nsecond string men on the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team, he said, but just<br />\na great combination, all working<br />\ntogether for the success of the<br />\nteam.<br />\nFather Bill Schmeisser made<br />\nthe final speech, and it was a new<br />\none. He let the team on to some<br />\nof the coaching secrets he and<br />\nReaney have used during this and<br />\nformer years.

Capt. \"Dick\" Benson started off like a house afire gathering<br />\nfive hits in the first two games, but then took a slump and failed to<br />\nconnect safely with the ball for the remainder of the season. Webb,<br />\nwith his consistent hitting, had things all his own way until Jack<br />\nJones broke into the game in place of Rogers. His first time at bat<br />\nthe little third-sacker smashed out a homer to left. He continued<br />\nclouting the pill, until, in the Catholic University game, he tied<br />\nWebb with a double. However, he lost his eye in the Army battle,<br />\nand, owing to his small number of trips to the plate, his percentage<br />\ndropped. Bloomsburg started off poorly, but proved to be a real dark<br />\nhorse, being Webb's sole competitor at the finish. Had the season<br />\ncontinued much longer it is a question as to who would have emerged<br />\non top. Larry Littman also starred with the stick.<br />\nWebb, besides carrying off the batting average, leads in the runscoring and extra-base hitting. Benson and Jones tied for stolen<br />\nbases.<br />\nIn fielding Benson is in a class by himself. During the entire<br />\nseason behind the bat, he made 54 putouts and 17 assists without a<br />\nsingle miscue. Moriarty was also in the 1.000 class, catching six hard<br />\nflies. Purcell managed himself well in the field, chalking up to his<br />\ncredit 84 putouts and letting four slip by. him, while Sickel tied him<br />\nwith 17 putouts, 4 assists and 1 error.<br />\nWelliver carried off the pitching honors, working exceptionally<br />\nwell in every contest but the Holy Cross game, which was his debut<br />\non the mound.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that nearly the entire team will return<br />\nnext year, and it is expected that they will acquit themselves well<br />\nnext season.<br />\nThe batting, pitching and fielding averages follow:<br />\nBATTING AVERAGES OF THE JOHNS HOPKINS BASEBALL TEAM.<br />\nTwo- ThreeSaulAt<br />\nBase.

May, 1917, the<br />\nForeign Service Committee of the<br />\nNational Research Council, found<br />\nitself at Chalons on the Marne,<br />\non a visit to the French front.<br />\nThe weather was beautiful, the<br />\nflowering shrubs and trees were in<br />\nfull bloom. The guns in actioh<br />\na few miles to the north were not<br />\naudible, and to the casual view<br />\nthe place seemed very much like<br />\na French garrison town in time of<br />\npeace. In the afternoon of the<br />\nday of our arrival, we went by<br />\nautomobiles to see the front lines.<br />\nAs we drove along the fine French<br />\nroads, through a fairly level country, we passed many lories moving<br />\nforward or to the rear; here and<br />\nthere we saw a camp of horses, or<br />\na park of supply wagons; occasionally a group of soldiers would<br />\nsaunter by, usually carrying picks<br />\nor spades, rifles being conspicuously absent. Now and then an<br />\nautomobile carrying officers, or a<br />\nman on motorcycle, would dash<br />\nby at a break-neck pace; but the<br />\ncountry seemed peaceful.<br />\nThe first indication of our approach to the front lines, was<br />\nsight of a row of captive observation balloons; they were placed<br />\nabout three miles behind the front<br />\nand three or four miles apart;<br />\nand thus, from a distance, marked<br />\nthe position of the lines. Sometimes six or eight were visible at<br />\nonce. As we approached, the distant booming of cannon could be<br />\nheard; but this section was inactive at the time of our visit, and<br />\nthe firing was not rapid. We left<br />\nthe automobiles and went to an<br />\nobservation post, which was placed<br />\nat the edge of a wood, so concealed by blanches as to be invisible at a small distance. From<br />\nthis point we could look over the<br />\nlines a short mile ahead. It was<br />\nan interesting and surprising<br />\nsight: a broad, very gently rolling<br />\ncountry, with patches of wood<br />\nhere and there, with the grass gone<br />\nfrom the part near the trenches,<br />\nwhich, in this region, were not<br />\n'very easily distinguished. Behind<br />\nus was the row of French captive<br />\nballoons, and at a greater distance<br />\nin front the enemy balloons; here<br />\nand there overhead an aeroplane<br />\nfloated in the sky, the noise of its<br />\nengine distinctly audible; frequently we would hear the sound<br />\nof a bursting shell and see the<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nExtracts From \"Hank\" Chalmer's Letters.<br />\n\"Hank\" is now with the Y.

He will ever be<br />\nremembered as a Hopkins all-around<br />\nman, and for his genial disposition.<br />\nThe following are extracts from his<br />\nletters:<br /><br />\n\"If things work out as I expect,<br />\nI shall be assigned to a dugout<br />\non tire French front working with<br />\nthe French soldiers. There has<br />\nbeen a call for volunteers for these<br />\nposts, because they can't send a<br />\nman there against his will; so, I<br />\nvolunteered, and they think I shall<br />\nbe accepted. If I get the job it<br />\nwill put me on the fighting line<br />\nwith the most marvelous opportunity for service I have had.<br />\nThe French people are wonderful,<br />\nand I hope I may be able to help<br />\nthem in their courageous fight.<br />\nThey say that we can render no<br />\nmore important service than our<br />\nwork among the French.\"<br />\n\"I am now only about twenty<br />\nmiles from the front, and there is<br />\nso much snow that it is impossible<br />\nto proceed at once to my Foyer.<br />\nIt is hard to get to, anyway, and,<br />\nespecially so, with two feet of<br />\nsnow on the ground.

It seems to<br />\nme that when we got organized,<br />\nafter the first few weeks, we have<br />\nhad a splendid spirit. Certainly<br />\nthe various athletic teams cannot<br />\nkick about the Freshmen not being well represented on them. To<br />\nthe football squad, we gave Carey<br />\nand Jones, and many others,<br />\nwhose spirit was none the less<br />\ngood, even if their opportunities<br />\nwere less great. Baseball stars<br />\nfrom the class of '21 were Weillye; Webb and J. Jones. Track<br />\nhad Mulliken and Van Ness. On<br />\nthe lacrosse team were Brennan<br />\nand Sadtler. Besides the men<br />\nnamed, there were many others<br />\nwho came out and gave of their<br />\nbest, that Hopkins might be successful in the field of sports. Our<br />\nclass, as well as the University,<br />\nis deeply grateful to them.<br />\nIn other things, too, the Freshmen have maintained a fine spirit.<br />\nThe few,regulations set down for<br />\nthem, during the first term were<br />\nvery well adhered to. Altogether,<br />\nthe class promises to be Ole to<br />\nmaintain, with honor to itself, the<br />\ntraditions of the University.<br />\nI look back \u2022upon the college<br />\nyear, now ending, as one of the<br />\nhappiest of my life, and as I look<br />\nforward to next year, I feel considerably saddened, when I think<br />\nof the s changes that will have<br />\ntaken place, of the students who<br />\nwill not return, and, perhaps, I<br />\nmyself will not be here. If this<br />\nlast should be the case, I want to<br />\nthank the professors for their fairness to me in my studies, and to<br />\nask the students to join me in a<br />\ngood, old Hullabaloo for Hopkins.<br />\nFRESHMAN.<br />\nConcerning the Employment Bureau.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nSir\u2014We have at the University<br />\nhere, although many students may<br />\nnot know it, an Employment Bu-<br /><br />\nThe Physics II Lab.<br />\n(An Extract from the Will of those<br />\nstudents finishing Physics II.)<br />\n* * * And the little Place<br />\nUp under the Roof of the M.

Death, from an<br />\ninvisible source, hovered about;<br />\nand the officers warned us that<br />\nif we exposed ourselves to view<br />\na German shell was likely soon to<br />\nland among us. This lesson was<br />\ntaught us in a very decisive way<br />\na few days later at Fort Douaumont near Verdun. After seeing<br />\nthe various underground passages,<br />\n\u2022 we had gone on top to look about.<br />\nAs near Chalons the country<br />\nlooked peaceful and deserted. A<br />\nFrench 75, so camouflaged that it<br />\nwas hardly visible at a distance<br />\nof 50 yards, barked sharply from<br />\ntime to time, as tho' to indicate<br />\nthat the fortress was not open to<br />\nstrangers. We stayed but a few<br />\nminutes, and had scarcely gotten<br />\nunder shelter, when, with a loud<br />\nexplosion, a German 77 landed<br />\nwhere we had been sitting, followed ten or fifteen seconds later<br />\nby a second. It was probably<br />\nsport to the German gunners, but<br />\nthey didn't see us again.<br />\nIt was absorbing to watch the<br />\nreconnoitering aeroplanes. They<br />\nswept majestically through the<br />\nair like great soaring buzzards.<br />\nAs we looked, a black splotch<br />\nwould suddenly appear in the air<br />\nin the neighborhood of a plane;<br />\nthen another, and another, until<br />\neight or ten could be seem. They<br />\nmarked the bursting of the antiaircraft shells. Gradually they<br />\ndissolved and disappeared, and the<br />\naeroplane sailed on undisturbed,<br />\nseemingly contemptuous of the efforts to bring it down.<br />\nAs a<br />\nfact, very few are destroyed in<br />\nthis way.<br />\nThe battle field about Douaumont was one vast collection of<br />\nshell holes; from a distance the<br />\nhill looks as though it had been<br />\ntrampled over by great herds; but<br />\na nearer view shows that the soil<br />\nhas all been overturned and the<br />\nformerly smooth surface is now<br />\nmerely a collection of intersecting<br />\nshell holes. Not a foot of the<br />\noriginal surface remains. The<br />\nFrench alone fired 360,000 shells<br />\nin one day when they retook the<br />\nfortress. It was gruesome sight;<br />\ncartridges, broken guns,fragments<br />\nof shells old accoutrements, lay<br />\nscattered<br />\n'about. Some shell holes<br />\ncontained rain water stained a<br />\ndeep red. An arm, a foot, or<br />\nlarger parts of bodies could be<br /><br />\nseen in places projecting from the<br />\nsides of the holes; and there was<br />\na stench that pervaded the whole<br />\nplace. There must be thousands<br />\nof bodies covered up in the ground<br />\non this hill. In the immediate<br />\nneighborhood of Fort Douaumont,<br />\nthough they had been clearing up<br />\nfor several months, remains were<br />\nstill being uncovered. We found<br />\nthe same general conditions at<br />\nVimy Ridge; the ground was so<br />\ntorn by shells, that the former<br />\nGerman trenches were scarcely<br />\nrecognizable.<br />\nIn our drives across the country, we passed many villages in<br />\nutter ruin. Some had been destroyed in the natural course of<br />\nbattles, others in sheer wantonness. The Kaiser is lately reported to have congratulated the<br />\npeople of Aix-la-Chapelle that<br />\ntheir country had not suffered the<br />\nfate of northern France. But<br />\nwhat can be said of a government<br />\nthat, for its own advantage, is<br />\nwilling to inflict such disaster on<br />\na neighbor and be complaisant because they have been spared? We<br />\nwant no German peace. It is to<br />\nbe hoped that the Allies may obtain so complete. a victory that<br />\nthey will be able to hold the German government strictly responsible for all it has done.
