At that time the year<br />\nhad just begun, freshmen were absolutely green, and upper classmen had not yet got back in the traces. It was only natural that<br />\nduring the first week all types of organization should be at sixes<br />\nand sevens. We contented ourselves, therefore, with simply calling attention to the poor spirit, since in the past such<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\ncomment,<br />\n<br />\ncoupled with the settling influence exerted by the passage of a<br />\nweek or two, has always been all that was necessary to set things<br />\ngoing right.<br />\nThis year we were wrong; it has not been sufficient. Three<br />\nhome games have been played. At no time have more than four<br />\nhundred and fifty students been present; out of the eight hundred<br />\nonly slightly more than six hundred have procured their Athletic<br />\nAssociation tickets.<br />\nSupport of the team, especially as evidenced by cheering at<br />\ngames, has lagged all year; and in the Loyola game, when it was<br />\nneeded most, it reached its lowest ebb.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the eleven was<br />\n<br />\nsliding around in the mud, fighting its hardest against an opponent of totally unexpected strength, what support did it get<br />\nfrom the stands?<br />\n<br />\nNot much. The cheering section, small as<br />\n<br />\nit is, was not completely filled. Those who were there, huddled<br />\naround a hurriedly summoned remnant of the band, save for a<br />\nfew yells which were not any too good, sat in dejected silence.<br />\nThat was not an inspiring sight to the men on the field, who were<br />\ndoing their best and taking a bad beating in the bargain; nor<br />\nwas it encouraging to any of those interested in football at Hopkins.<br />\n\"Playing the game for the game's sake,\" and not \"a winner<br />\nat any cost,\" may be only poses at some institutions. At Hopkins this spirit has been genuine, and in it lies the strength and<br />\nvalue of athletics at the University. An incident like the spirit<br />\nat the Loyola game may be an indication that the old Hopkins<br />\nstandards of amateurism and sturdy support are changing. We<br />\nhope, however, that it was only an accident, springing from some<br />\nother cause.<br />\nThree more home games, including the two biggest, remain.<br />\nAt these three games we will have a chance to see whether or not<br />\nthe old Hopkins fight is passing.<br />\n<br />\nDr. French Picks<br />\nFrosh Debaters<br />\nAt a meeting of the candidates<br />\nfor the freshman debating team<br />\non last Wednesday, Dr. French<br />\npicked the men who will represent<br />\nthe class in the annual FreshmanSophomore Debate.<br />\nDr. French's selections were<br />\nbased on the quality of speeches<br />\nthat each candidate prepared on<br />\neither side of the question, \"Resolved, That the non-athletic activities in American colleges constitute an unwise use of the student's time.\"<br />\nThere was an exceedingly poor<br />\nrepresentation\u2014only four members of the class being present.<br />\nThe team finally chosen consisted<br />\nof Milton Blumenfeld, chairman,<br />\nPaul Spear, Paul Cordish, and<br />\nLeroy London, alternate.<br />\n<br />\nonl.<br />\ntile<br />\nit-1g<br />\nthe<br />\nTac<br />\nati<br />\nas<br />\nlea<br />\nCht<br />\nhas<br />\n<br />\nTHEATRE<br />\nDr. David Moore Robinson,<br />\nthe Corner from City Hall\"<br />\nAround<br />\n\"Just<br />\nProfessor of Archaeolgy and Epigraphy and Lecturer on Greek litThis Week<br />\nerature, is now out west visiting<br />\nCommencing Monday<br />\nmany of the important museums<br />\nNovember 1<br />\nand universities.

Dean Ames, in commenting on this step, said that the<br />\nLeland-Stanford plan would differ<br />\nfrom Johns Hopkins' in that Leland-Stanford does not plan to<br />\nmake a graduate university out of<br />\ntheir college, but merely to have<br />\ntwo years of college instead of<br />\nfour.<br />\nIt is thought that the great<br />\nnumber of junior colleges in California, will greatly facilitate the<br />\nworkings of the advanced plan at<br />\nLeland-Stanford. These junior<br />\ncolleges include just the first two<br />\nyears of college and a man who<br />\ngraduates from one of them will<br />\nbe eligible to enter Leland-Stanford immediately. It is thought<br />\nthat probably several of these<br />\njunior colleges will spring up in<br />\n<br />\nmbass31<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\nMaryland, when Johns Hopkins<br />\nadopts its new system.<br />\nDean Ames said that it is impossible to know if Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of LelandStanford developed his idea from<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins plan or if it<br />\nwas merely a natural outgrowth<br />\nfrom the junior colleges in California. In either case it reflects<br />\nhonor upon Dr. Goodnow who<br />\nfirst originated the plan to have<br />\nanother college adopt it.<br />\nThe workings of this plan at<br />\nJohns Hopkins will be much more<br />\nelaborate and comprehensive than<br />\nat Leland-Stanford. This will he<br />\nthe case since at Leland-Stanford<br />\nthey are going to limit their college, while we intend to expand<br />\nours. Their plan will merely make<br />\na two-year college from a fouryear one, while the plan here will<br />\nchange a college to a great university.<br />\n<br />\nE. E.

At that time the year<br />\nhad just begun, freshmen were absolutely green, and upper classmen had not yet got back in the traces. It was only natural that<br />\nduring the first week all types of organization should be at sixes<br />\nand sevens. We contented ourselves, therefore, with simply calling attention to the poor spirit, since in the past such<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\ncomment,<br /><br />\ncoupled with the settling influence exerted by the passage of a<br />\nweek or two, has always been all that was necessary to set things<br />\ngoing right.<br />\nThis year we were wrong; it has not been sufficient. Three<br />\nhome games have been played. At no time have more than four<br />\nhundred and fifty students been present; out of the eight hundred<br />\nonly slightly more than six hundred have procured their Athletic<br />\nAssociation tickets.<br />\nSupport of the team, especially as evidenced by cheering at<br />\ngames, has lagged all year; and in the Loyola game, when it was<br />\nneeded most, it reached its lowest ebb.<br /><br />\nWhile the eleven was<br /><br />\nsliding around in the mud, fighting its hardest against an opponent of totally unexpected strength, what support did it get<br />\nfrom the stands?<br /><br />\nNot much. The cheering section, small as<br /><br />\nit is, was not completely filled. Those who were there, huddled<br />\naround a hurriedly summoned remnant of the band, save for a<br />\nfew yells which were not any too good, sat in dejected silence.<br />\nThat was not an inspiring sight to the men on the field, who were<br />\ndoing their best and taking a bad beating in the bargain; nor<br />\nwas it encouraging to any of those interested in football at Hopkins.<br />\n\"Playing the game for the game's sake,\" and not \"a winner<br />\nat any cost,\" may be only poses at some institutions. At Hopkins this spirit has been genuine, and in it lies the strength and<br />\nvalue of athletics at the University. An incident like the spirit<br />\nat the Loyola game may be an indication that the old Hopkins<br />\nstandards of amateurism and sturdy support are changing. We<br />\nhope, however, that it was only an accident, springing from some<br />\nother cause.<br />\nThree more home games, including the two biggest, remain.<br />\nAt these three games we will have a chance to see whether or not<br />\nthe old Hopkins fight is passing.<br /><br />\nDr. French Picks<br />\nFrosh Debaters<br />\nAt a meeting of the candidates<br />\nfor the freshman debating team<br />\non last Wednesday, Dr. French<br />\npicked the men who will represent<br />\nthe class in the annual FreshmanSophomore Debate.<br />\nDr. French's selections were<br />\nbased on the quality of speeches<br />\nthat each candidate prepared on<br />\neither side of the question, \"Resolved, That the non-athletic activities in American colleges constitute an unwise use of the student's time.\"<br />\nThere was an exceedingly poor<br />\nrepresentation\u2014only four members of the class being present.<br />\nThe team finally chosen consisted<br />\nof Milton Blumenfeld, chairman,<br />\nPaul Spear, Paul Cordish, and<br />\nLeroy London, alternate.<br /><br />\nonl.<br />\ntile<br />\nit-1g<br />\nthe<br />\nTac<br />\nati<br />\nas<br />\nlea<br />\nCht<br />\nhas<br /><br />\nTHEATRE<br />\nDr. David Moore Robinson,<br />\nthe Corner from City Hall\"<br />\nAround<br />\n\"Just<br />\nProfessor of Archaeolgy and Epigraphy and Lecturer on Greek litThis Week<br />\nerature, is now out west visiting<br />\nCommencing Monday<br />\nmany of the important museums<br />\nNovember 1<br />\nand universities.

Dean Ames, in commenting on this step, said that the<br />\nLeland-Stanford plan would differ<br />\nfrom Johns Hopkins' in that Leland-Stanford does not plan to<br />\nmake a graduate university out of<br />\ntheir college, but merely to have<br />\ntwo years of college instead of<br />\nfour.<br />\nIt is thought that the great<br />\nnumber of junior colleges in California, will greatly facilitate the<br />\nworkings of the advanced plan at<br />\nLeland-Stanford. These junior<br />\ncolleges include just the first two<br />\nyears of college and a man who<br />\ngraduates from one of them will<br />\nbe eligible to enter Leland-Stanford immediately. It is thought<br />\nthat probably several of these<br />\njunior colleges will spring up in<br /><br />\nmbass31<br />\nE<br /><br />\nMaryland, when Johns Hopkins<br />\nadopts its new system.<br />\nDean Ames said that it is impossible to know if Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of LelandStanford developed his idea from<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins plan or if it<br />\nwas merely a natural outgrowth<br />\nfrom the junior colleges in California. In either case it reflects<br />\nhonor upon Dr. Goodnow who<br />\nfirst originated the plan to have<br />\nanother college adopt it.<br />\nThe workings of this plan at<br />\nJohns Hopkins will be much more<br />\nelaborate and comprehensive than<br />\nat Leland-Stanford. This will he<br />\nthe case since at Leland-Stanford<br />\nthey are going to limit their college, while we intend to expand<br />\nours. Their plan will merely make<br />\na two-year college from a fouryear one, while the plan here will<br />\nchange a college to a great university.<br /><br />\nE. E.
