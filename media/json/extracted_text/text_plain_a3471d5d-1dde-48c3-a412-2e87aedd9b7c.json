Considers Constitution<br />\nBY PETER CINQUEGRANI<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council deliberates on the proposed Adjudicatory Code.<br />\n<br />\nA proposed new Student<br />\nCouncil Constitution was unveiled<br />\nat Wednesday night's Council<br />\nmeeting by SC Vice-President<br />\nBarbara Squires. The constitution was written by Squires,<br />\nSid<br />\nSecretary<br />\nCouncil<br />\nGoodfriend, and Junior Class<br />\nPresident Mike Steele.<br />\nThe idea for a new constitution arose at a Council meeting<br />\nlast year, when an examination<br />\nof the constitution was made to<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council Hearing Debate<br />\nOn ProposedAd'udicator Code<br />\nBY SUNITA HANJURA<br />\nThe continued discussion of<br />\nthe Undergraduate Adjudicatory<br />\nCode comprised most of the<br />\nStudent Council's Feb. 20 meeting.<br />\nAt this point, the University<br />\nPeDemi Counsel, Estelle Fishbein, has had a chance to comment on the Code, and her<br />\nobjections fall into two main<br />\ncategories: a) aspects of the<br />\nCode that are illegal and must be<br />\nchanged; b) items she dislikes<br />\nand recommends the Council<br />\nmodify or change.<br />\nKaren Loebel opened the<br />\ndiscussion by asking that the<br />\nCouncil define what the Code<br />\nThe<br />\nhas jurisdiction over.<br />\nUniversity General Counsel proposed stating that the Code have<br />\njurisdiction over crimes 1)<br />\nagainst University property; 2)<br />\n<br />\nagainst a person affiliated with<br />\nthe University; and 3) against<br />\nthe property of a member of the<br />\nThe<br />\nUniversity community.<br />\nCode previously said that jurisdiction should be determined by<br />\nBaltimore City, Maryland state<br />\nand Federal law.<br />\nSid Goodfriend opposed<br />\ndefining jurisdiction in such a<br />\nHe contended that<br />\nmanner.<br />\nsetting such guidelines will mean<br />\nthat the Code lacks a set procedure. Arguing that \"the ac-cused and the accuser should<br />\nknow what the're getting into\"<br />\nbeforehand, Goodfriend's main<br />\nobjection was that similar cases<br />\nmay be viewed differently in<br />\ntwo consecutive years, depending on who is on the Adjudicatory Board.<br />\nIn favor of changing the<br />\nclassification of what jurisdiction includes, Connolly said that<br />\n<br />\nthe Council needs to adopt a<br />\nCode to fulfill the needs of the<br />\ncommunity. Connolly proposed<br />\nthat jurisdiction \"arise out of<br />\naffiliation with the University<br />\ncommunity,\" and that damage<br />\nmust be proved. The Counsel<br />\nchose not to define exactly what<br />\nconstitutes the \"University<br />\nConnolly's<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nmotion was approved by the<br />\nmajority in an informal vote.<br />\nAnother major point of<br />\ndiscussion was whether the hearing should remain private. The<br />\nCouncil ran through a gamut of<br />\npros and cons on this issue.<br />\nThe basic argument was that<br />\ncertain Council members challenge the stipulation that the<br />\naccused have the sole right to<br />\ndicide whether a meeting be<br />\nopened. Goodfriend suggested<br />\nthat the defendant and the<br />\n\u2022 cont. on p.5<br />\n<br />\nMaryland's College Republicans<br />\nOpen Meeting Here Tomorrow<br />\n<br />\ndetermine whether an Election<br />\nCommission could be formed to<br />\ntry to z-illevia i.e recurring probems<br />\nwith Student Council and class<br />\nofficer elections. According to<br />\nSquires, \"since we were looking<br />\nat the Constitution, we noticed<br />\nsome other things that needed<br />\nchanges.\"<br />\nSquires reported that the<br />\nmajor alterations considered<br />\nnecessary were for clarification<br />\nof procedt ral questions and a<br />\nsystemization of the voting<br />\nstructure. She commented that<br />\nthere seemed to be no pattern in<br />\nthe old constitution governing<br />\nthe number of votes necessary<br />\nfor the Council to approve such<br />\naction as the recall of appointed<br />\nofficers, closing meetings and<br />\nthe impeachment of Council<br />\nmembers. She added that it was<br />\noften difficult to determine any<br />\nset figure for the number of<br />\n<br />\nvotes needed to approve actions.<br />\nSquires noted that there<br />\nwere problems with Committee<br />\nstructure that the Council hoped<br />\nto correct with the new constitution.<br />\nwas<br />\nquestion<br />\nAnother<br />\nwhether missing two Council<br />\nmeetings was sufficient grounds<br />\nfor expulsion from the SC.<br />\nwas<br />\nConstitution<br />\nThe<br />\nwritten over Intersession after<br />\nagreement by the Council that<br />\nthat would be a good time to get<br />\nit finished. Having planned to<br />\nstay at Hopkins over Intersession, Squires volunteered for the<br />\nwork. The opportunity to assist<br />\nher was offered to any Council<br />\nmember who was interested and<br />\nwould be here. Both Steele and<br />\nGoodfriend volunteered to help.<br />\nSquires emphasized that<br />\nthis document w:is not in its<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br />\n<br />\nMSE Staff Fights Lice<br />\nIn Ladies' Lavatories<br />\nBY MARK TRACHTENBERG<br />\nThe restrooms in the Milton<br />\nS.

The Academic Council has directed CUS to<br />\nreview the report submitted by<br />\nthe Curriculum Review Committee (CRC) at the end of last<br />\nDecember. CUS will hold several<br />\nmeetings in March to examine<br />\nthe CRC report before making<br />\ntheir recommendations to the<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\nElkin feels that the scope of<br />\n<br />\nthe report as it now stands is<br />\nmuch narrower than it was<br />\noriginally. Although the CRC<br />\ndid deal with some specific<br />\nproblems, such as course<br />\nrequirements, advising and Intersession, it did not provide a<br />\ncomprehensive _discussion of the<br />\nUniversity's responsibility to its<br />\nstudents. The Education Committee hopes to raise student<br />\nconsciousness and generate<br />\ninterest in the quality of education at Hopkins by providing<br />\nforums for discussion, according<br />\nto Elkin.<br />\n\"This is a university where<br />\nfaculty autonomy and independence is maintained and<br />\nfought for very hard,\" said<br />\nElkin. He believes therefore<br />\nthat it is necessary for students<br />\nto be aware of and concerned<br />\nwith the academic atmosphere<br />\nprovided at JHU. \"This is an<br />\n<br />\nRobert Elkin<br />\nimportant period at Hopkins,\"<br />\nElkin said. \"We are being presented with the chance to make<br />\nsubstantive changes in the direction of education offered here.\"<br />\n<br />\nV-P Squires Explains<br />\nConstitution Needs<br />\ncont. from p. /<br />\nprovisions<br />\nthe<br />\nconcerning<br />\nfinal form asnd would almost by-laws of the Constitution.<br />\ncertainly be amended by the<br />\nUnder the current ConstituCouncil during debate on its tion a Council member can only<br />\npassage.

Again.<br />\nUnfortunately, the only response<br />\nthis fact has elicited from most Hopkins<br />\nstudents has been a resounding \"So<br />\nwhat?\" Undergraduates here are notorious for having only the sketchiest knowledge of Baltimore, but unfamiliarity with<br />\na valuable part of one's own university<br />\nwhich lies only twenty blocks away is not<br />\neasily excusable. The fact of the matter is<br />\nthat if Peabody ceases to exist, the<br />\nabsence will be sorely felt by all of<br />\nHopkins, and we will have lost a rare asset<br />\nand fine opportunity.<br />\nWe will not dwell on the great<br />\nintrinsic merits of supporting an institution the caliber of Peabody, because, for<br />\none reason or another, such arguments<br />\nseem to have little persuasive power on<br />\nthis campus. Instead, we will take a<br />\npurely selfish approach and ask \"What can<br />\nPeabody do for Homewood?\"<br />\nFor one thing, it can help to<br />\ndiscredit the image Hopkins has as a<br />\nmonolithic pre-med factory. Despite the<br />\nmany strong Humanities departments<br />\nhere, most outsiders still assume that<br />\nanyone attending Hopkins wants to be a<br />\ndoctor. Having a world-famous conservatory connected to the University might go<br />\nfar toward softening our distorted, hard\u2014<br />\nscience image.<br />\nIt is a truism that Hopkins is a sec-<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nond-choice haven for Ivy League also-rans.<br />\nHopkins seems to be the place where<br />\nundergrads who couldn't quite make it into<br />\nPrinceton wind up. One of the factors<br />\nwhich make Ivy League schools so revered<br />\nis that they possess excellent institutions<br />\nwhich are distinct from their basic Arts &<br />\nSciences curriculum:<br />\nHarvard Law,<br />\nYale Divinity, etc. In Peabody, Hopkins<br />\nhas just such an \"Ivy League\" asset. A<br />\ntop-notch conservatory, in conjunction<br />\nwith the existing top-notch School of<br />\nMedicine, can put to rest many of the<br />\nexcuses employed to keep Hopkins<br />\nout of the first eschelon of American<br />\nuniversities.<br />\nPart of the reason for student<br />\napathy is that the great resources of<br />\nPeabody are not being handled properly.<br />\nThe concerts, most of them free, are not<br />\nwell publicized at Homewood, and<br />\nthe many different types of music which<br />\nPeabody students perform has not been<br />\nstressed. Why, for instance, hasn't the<br />\nJazz Ensemble performed any we<br />\n*NO<br />\ndates at the Rat or the Glass Pavilion? A-if<br />\nlittle more contact between aspiring !.<br />\nmuscicians and pre-meds might break<br />\ndown the popular notion that they are<br />\ntwo groups who inhabit mutually exclusive worlds.<br />\nWe strongly support all efforts to<br />\nobtain, state financial assistance for the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory.<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\n<br />\n(Letters To The Editor<br />\n<br />\nPeter Choo<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nAnne McElwee<br />\n<br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nTex Naim<br />\nPhilip Schutzer<br />\n<br />\n1 eI I i<br />\n<br />\nProduction Staff<br />\nJeff Adelman<br />\nChris Hurley<br />\nDeborah Jones<br />\nP.J.

At<br />\nthe beginning of this semester,<br />\nthe editorial staff of the N-L was<br />\ngiven a similar privilege with<br />\nthe reinstatement of a column<br />\ncalled \"Opinion.\" Each week an<br />\neditor or a staff member is<br />\nresponsible on a rotating basis<br />\nfor filling this space with his or<br />\nher opinion. The column is<br />\nsigned, which indicates to the<br />\nreader that the author alone is<br />\nresponsible for the article, and<br />\nthat the opinions are solely his<br />\n(or her, in this case) own.<br />\nNow that the status of this<br />\nstatement, as well as that of<br />\nlettters to the Editor, has<br />\nbeen established, let me ask a<br />\nquestion. Who wrote that article<br />\ndirectly above and to the right<br />\nof mine? A surprisingly large<br />\namount of people think that the<br />\narticle in question, commonly<br />\nreferred to as an editorial, is the<br />\nopinion of the entire editorial<br />\n<br />\nstaff. Plausible hypothesis. But<br />\nlet me ask another question. If<br />\nthe editorial expresses my<br />\nopinions, as well as those of my<br />\ncolleagues, what need have we<br />\nfor the space set aside for<br />\n\"Opinion\"?<br />\nA misconception obviously<br />\nexists here which I feel responsible to clear up. The editorial<br />\ndoes not express (as it did in the<br />\npast) the view of the entire<br />\neditorial staff; in fact it does not<br />\nexpress the views of part of the<br />\neditorial staff. To be frank, I<br />\ndon't even know what the<br />\neditorial is going to be until I see<br />\nthe paper Friday morning.<br />\nI am not trying to find fault<br />\nwith the editorials written by<br />\nour Editor-In-Chief, Cates Baldridge; on the contrary, I believe<br />\nthat they are for the most part<br />\nintelligent, well-written opinions. My complaint is that they<br />\nare his opinions, not mine, and<br />\njust as I am responsible for<br />\nidentifying the author of my<br />\nviews, I feel he sould be likewise<br />\nobligated. The editorial \"we\"<br />\ncont. on p. 6<br />\n<br />\nnoticeably radical newssheet. force our beliefs on anyone else.<br />\nInstead,our purpose stems from<br />\nCheap Talk<br />\nEdmund L.

(BDM has<br />\ngrown an average 30 percent per<br />\nyear for the past 7 years.)<br />\n<br />\n2.\"Why is corporate growth<br />\nso important?\"<br />\nStrong corporate growth means that<br />\nthe opportunity for personal career<br />\ngrowth is much greater than in a<br />\nmore static organization.(Graduates<br />\nwho joined BDM two years ago have<br />\nmoved far ahead of their counterparts in most other organizations.)<br />\n<br />\n3.\"Why should I join a professional services company?\"<br />\n<br />\nbecome a service economy.

(BDM<br />\ngives you the best of two worlds \u2014<br />\nprofessional services growth plus a<br />\ncorporate focus on tomorrow's<br />\ntechnology and systems.)<br />\n<br />\n4.\"Whatare the most promising fields in which to apply<br />\nmy technical skills?\"<br />\n<br />\nNational defense, communications,<br />\nenergy,the environment,and transportation come quickly to mind.(Not<br />\ncoincidentally, these are the primary<br />\nThe Professionals We Seek<br />\nWe offer career opportunities to men<br />\nand women with degrees in ENGINEERING (especially EE ME.<br />\nAPPLIED PHYSICS<br />\nand AE )<br />\nAPPLIED MATHEMATICS<br />\nCOMPUTER SCIENCE (Scientific<br />\nOPERATIONS<br />\nApplications)<br />\nRESEARCH<br />\nWe re looking for highly motivated<br />\npeople who want the challenge of<br />\nanalyzing and solving problems in<br />\ncommunications software development systems analysis computer<br />\nsimulation and modeling laser physics and engineering, electro-optics.<br />\nnuclear effects, statistical test design. logistics electronics environmental sciences economics and<br />\nmanagement sciences energy<br />\nproduction and distribution and<br />\nrelated areas<br />\n<br />\nFor one reason, because ours has<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\nTHE<br />\nCORP RATION<br />\n<br />\nimplies opinion, and of what use<br />\nis an opinion which states<br />\nnothing but a diluted, middleof-the-road hodge-podge constructed from bits and pieces<br />\nfrom all positions ofa particular<br />\nissue.<br />\nLet there be no mistake.<br />\nThe editorials in the News-Letter<br />\nreflect my opinion and mine<br />\nalone.

I think that sponsoring<br />\nan event where a woman sells<br />\nher body to a probably drunk<br />\nand somewhat pressured student<br />\nis carrying the idea of sexual<br />\nfreedom a bit too far. By<br />\nplacing the assault on stripper<br />\nnight in the same context as<br />\nwitch burnings and literature<br />\nbans, Mr. Ebsworth seems to<br />\nexpect people to pity the<br />\npoor frats who are being unfairly<br />\nassaulted for having a little fun.<br />\nIt doesn't take a puritanical<br />\nmorality to see that there's<br />\nsomething inherently degrading<br />\nabout prostitution, and to try<br />\nand shroud it in rhetoric about<br />\nfreedom of expression clouds<br />\nthe real issue.<br />\nWhat is most annoying<br />\nabout Mr. Ebsworth's letter is<br />\nthe way he trys to treat the<br />\nentire event as a joke by assuming that those who were against<br />\nthe stripper-prostitutes were<br />\nmerely frustrated individuals.<br />\nHe writes, \"As an expedient<br />\nrelease for their tensions, nothing beats the indignant adoption<br />\nof a trivial cause, especially if it<br />\nallows one to condemn the<br />\nminor recreations of those who<br />\nseem to be having more fun.\"<br />\nBy calling prostitution \"trivial\",<br />\nEbsworth callously neglects the<br />\nfact that we are talking about a<br />\nperson, and not merely a sexual<br />\ntoy to be exploited.<br />\nEven if both parties consent, the frats involved are still<br />\ntaking advantage of a social<br />\nproblem which they can't ignore<br />\nwhen sponsoiing such events.

They can<br />\nignore - self-righteous preaching<br />\nof morality. They can not<br />\nignore the fact that a prostitute's<br />\nselling her body, even with<br />\nmutual consent, is not exactly<br />\ntrivial and involves a lot more<br />\nthan supposedly harmless fun.<br />\nMaybe when persons like Mr.<br />\nEbsworth and the frats realize<br />\nthat their entertainment involves<br />\npeople and not just things to be<br />\nused for \"minor recreation,\"<br />\nthey'll see that there have got to<br />\nbe better ways to approach Rush<br />\nweek.<br />\nGary Tolchinsky<br />\n<br />\nimpilimoimmoommooli.<br />\n<br />\n\frim<br />\n<br />\n1010<br />\n<br />\nEfl<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 7<br />\n10<br />\n101<br />\nDl<br />\n<br />\n\\xcloir<br />\n\"THE STATE OF THE ARTS IN MARYLAND\"<br />\nwith<br />\nMR.

The big day has finally arrived.<br />\nYour extended childhood is over, and you're ready to<br />\nassume a place in the \"Real World.\" And because<br />\nyou're a JHU grad, you expect to assume a significant<br />\nplace. In other words, a degree from mighty Johns<br />\nHopkins guarantees success.<br />\nThis may be the way it works for some people,<br />\nbut for other bonafide Hopkins men and women, Ringo<br />\nStarr's song says it all. This article, written as it is by<br />\na '78 Hopkins grad, is designed to advise graduating<br />\nseniors concerning the months after graduation, which<br />\ncan be a tough time for most people.<br />\nI hope the ideas and realities discussed here will<br />\nbe reassuring, or at least informative, to those who<br />\ngraduate and find that success does not fall into one's<br />\nlap. The Alumni Association will ask for dues, and the<br />\nperson responsible for getting funds from your class will<br />\ntry to milk money from you for the old alma mater, and<br />\nyou'll get those forms to fill out which ask you what<br />\nyour position is (dishwasher?), but no Hopkins official is<br />\ngoing to come down off his/her throne to tell you that<br />\nHopkins grads are not \"can't miss\" overnite sensations.<br />\nBelieve me, the Placement Office is only helpful if you<br />\ndon't need its assistance in the first place. Besides, they<br />\ntold you when you applied that you shouldn't come<br />\nhere unless you knew what you wanted to do.<br />\nThere are two groups of people for whom the<br />\ninformation presented here is not particularly relevant.<br />\nPeople who are (1) going directly on to grad school; and<br />\n(2) engineers and the like people who get great (17-20 K<br />\nper annum) jobs right away. Such folks will probably<br />\nnot experience that great change of life crisis which<br />\nbegins when one walks out of the hallowed halls of the<br />\nivory tower with a BA or BS, a crisis known as Post-Graduate Depression.<br />\nPost-Graduate Depression is a malaise which is<br />\nalmost never fatal, but it's damned uncomfortable while<br />\nit lasts -- and that may be a year or two. For most, it<br />\ncan last at least a summer. PGD, as we might call it,<br />\ninvolves the dawning realization that one has been thrust<br />\ninto a game with rules which differ from those of<br />\ncollege. The young man who lounges so cavalierly in<br />\nfront of Levering with his tattered jeans and free-style<br />\nhair, puffing on a joint, will find that the admiration his<br />\ncare-free actions generate on campus is not to be found<br />\nin the Real World. There is no more tragic sight than the<br />\nBig Man On Campus who one apring struts across his<br />\nturf like a sexual tycoon, while the next finds him<br />\ncowering in some executive's office with a fresh haircut,<br />\ngroveling for a job.<br />\n<br />\nPost-Graduate Depression is usually over when the<br />\nsubject has adapted to the Real World, i.e. is self-supporting, and has adjusted his/her social life to the<br />\nworking routine. The transformation is tough, because<br />\nthe job market is crowded. And if you're a white male,<br />\nyour shot at a good management track program is cut<br />\nby, say, 2/3, because those women who were once<br />\ncontent to be secretaries, and those minorities who once<br />\nnever made it to college, want a slice of your action with a vengeance. That realization doesn't make your<br />\nego feel any better when the days are long and lean.<br />\nAdjusting socially is as tough as getting the job.<br />\nFirst, you can't party until four in the morning and then<br />\nsleep through that ten o'clock class. Chronic absenteeism can blight your budding career pronto. Not only<br />\nthat, but after you graduate, you find you can't hang<br />\nout in front of Levering, or in the Rat, Library, coffee<br />\nshop, or other former favorite haunts, without attracting<br />\nthe goading question, \"What are you doing here?\" I<br />\nswear that I have encountered this question almost every<br />\ntime I've been on campus since that September in '78<br />\nwhen I glumly closed my Gilman bank account(low on<br />\nfunds) as the cheery underclassmen returned. The<br />\nquestion is irritating in any case, because it implies<br />\n(correctly) that you're no longer \"one of us.\" And if<br />\nyou have a lousy job or no job, you don't want to field<br />\nthe inevitable questions about what you're doing with<br />\nyour life, especially if those questions are tossed at you<br />\nby some bright-eyes undergrad who wields the whip<br />\ninnocently but effectively. I mean, you already have<br />\nyour dad telling you to \"get a job\" and asking \"Why do<br />\nyou think I spent a fortune putting you through<br />\nschool?\"<br />\nSee what I mean? When you graduate, you have<br />\na new social status and role as surely as a man in nineteenth century America who is suddenly transmogrified<br />\nfrom white to black. And the people who aren't standing in your shoes will not give a shit about your predicament. Those who haven't gotten this far don't know<br />\nwhat you're going through, and those who have already<br />\npassed this stage don't want much to do with anyone<br />\nwho is going through \"that stage.\" Those who have<br />\nsuccessfully resisted the urge to become a leftist during<br />\nschool sometimes succumb in the midst of Post-Graduate Depression. They thus suddenly stumble onto a<br />\ndandy new make-shift philosophy -\"Hey, everybody<br />\nought to have a job!\" This usually lasts until capitalism<br />\nhas mercy on them and gives them a place in the sun,at<br />\nwhich point they abandon their foolish ideas and completely forget about everyone back in the ringer.<br />\nOne good label for this new status and role is<br />\n\"B.A. Generalist.\" This phrase, devised by the Peace<br />\nCorps, classifies people who have a college degree but<br />\ndon't really know how to do anything which is marketable. This is the group which usually receives the full<br />\nimpact of Post-Graduate Depression. For these, of which<br />\nI was one, there aren't a lot of alternatives. The fact<br />\nthat one was, say, the smartest kid in one's High School<br />\ndoesn't mean doodly-squat in the job market.

(This is where the guys<br />\nwho were a lot dumber than you in high school get their<br />\nlong-a-waited revenge as they watch you squirm.) B.A.<br />\nGeneralists, excluding those who postpone the issue or<br />\nresolve it by going immediately to grad school, often<br />\nface the agonffing situation of being overqualified for<br />\nthe position they wind up in after graduation, and often<br />\nfeel that they are not using a great deal of their potential. This feeling of under-achievement is perhaps the<br />\nbitterest part of Post-Graduate Depression. One wit<br />\nquipped that the paycheck is life's report card, and for<br />\nthe person who's used to getting high grades at Hopkins,<br />\nthe drop in G.P.A. is usually pretty discouraging.

You have to<br />\naccept the fact that you're going to have to start on the<br />\nfirst rung of the ladder and prove that your intelligence<br />\nis good for something besides high grades. And emploY.<br />\ners often shy away from people who are fresh out of<br />\nschool (unless they have a marketable skill) because<br />\nnobody wants to be the one to break in the greenhorns.<br />\nThe situation I'm outlining is the worst possible<br />\none for the normal graduate: (1) You don't have all<br />\nimmediately marketable skill(How, you lash at yourself,<br />\ndid I let myself get into this mess?);(2) You're too sick<br />\nof school to go on to grad school, even though addition'<br />\nal certification means something; (3) You don't have,<br />\na \"connection\" who can land you that great job;(4)<br />\nYou need money, i.e. can't afford to screw around for a<br />\nyear or two while living off Dad or some other charitabl:No<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nI guess the first thing to do is figure out where<br />\nyou want to live when you leave Hopkins. Do you want<br />\nto live near campus, move back to your home town, or III<br />\njust (hardest of all) move to a different city where Y\u00b0L1<br />\ndon't know anybody? Do you want to more back wit'',<br />\nyour parents for a while?

I lived with my<br />\nparents for a four and a half month period after graduation, and it was really tough for everybody.

Most people<br />\nsacrifice clean air for proximity to a highly populated<br />\narea with more jobs, or they are prepared for a long<br />\ncommute every day, a wearisome and potentially dangerous (in light of the energy situation) plan. D.C. is a<br />\ngood example: the crime is really bad, and it's crowded,<br />\ntAit anybody can land some kind of white collar job<br />\nthere sooner or later. You just try to be careful and<br />\nforget about the sexual assault that occured on the<br />\nsubway during rush hour. And if you're willing to spend<br />\na couple hours a day on public transportation, and if<br />\nYou can stand living in squalor in the wealthiest county<br />\nIn the country, you can settle in beautiful Silver Spring.<br />\nChecking out the want ads is probably your next<br />\nstep, once you've decided where you're going to locate.<br />\nThey're a crude vehicle for finding a job, but the person<br />\nWithout contacts doesn't have many other ways of<br />\ndiscovering job opportunities. Very rarely does it happen<br />\nthat a friend notifies you of a great job opportunity<br />\nWhich doesn't interest him. Want ads are a long shot,<br />\nbut they can come through, so they are at least worthy<br />\nof examination. Reading the classified help wanted ads<br />\n<br />\ninvariably depressed me, but I guess that's just an<br />\noccupational hazard.<br />\nGoing to an employment agency is a good<br />\nmaneuver, because it gives you a foothold. You've got a<br />\ncounselor whose livelihood depends on getting you a<br />\njob, and he or she has contacts, and can set up interviews. Even if the interviews aren't good ones, they<br />\nprovide good experience in the art of selling yourself.<br />\nYou will probably be interviewed for jobs as an insurance salesman, manager of a Burger King, or file clerk,<br />\nbut what the heck. There are only two catches. The<br />\nfirst is that it may take you awhile before you recognize<br />\nthat your counselor is incompetent, and can switch<br />\nagencies. The second is that a job which is not fee paid<br />\nis going to consume a lot of your first paychecks.<br />\nEmployment agencies usually take 10-12% of your<br />\nannual salary for a non-fee paid job, and they take<br />\nit in the first ninety days of your employment. That's<br />\nrough. But on the other hand, there are lots of fee paid<br />\njobs (the employer pays the 10-12%) and half-fee paid<br />\njobs(half as bad as a non-fee paid job).<br />\nTrying to get a job with the Government is worth<br />\na try, because Government positions are usually pretty<br />\ncomfortable for the B. A. Generalist. The Professional<br />\nCareer Administrative Examination(PACE)is the test to<br />\ntake. Make sure you register in time, because it's only<br />\ngiven a couple of times a year. (And find out what<br />\n\"AI71\" is -- the basic form for applying to federal agencies for employment). But a good score on this board<br />\ntest will land you a Government job that virtually<br />\nguarantees steady promotion. One Hopkins girl got a<br />\n100 on this test, and got dozens of job offers. On the<br />\nother hand, if you get less than a ninety, better intensify<br />\nelsewhere. The IRS hires a lot a people because they do<br />\nthe dirty work that most people don't want any part of.<br />\nI had a shot at an IRS position in New Brunswick, NJ,<br />\nbut I wasn't that desperate. You can get your PACE<br />\neligibility (originally good for a year) extended for an<br />\nindefinite period, so you really can't lose. The main<br />\nproblem is that the new Civil Service Act really cut<br />\ndown on Government hiring largesse. A hiring freeze<br />\ncan wipe you out for months. The problem with the<br />\nGovernment is getting in; once you're in, you're well on<br />\nyour way, particularly if you're willing to live in D.C.<br />\nBut you'll almost deinitely need a temporary job while<br />\nyou wait to hear from Uncle Sam.<br />\nA good resume is going to be a helpful supplement to the above-mentioned steps. This document<br />\nshould cover your job experience, education, and<br />\npersonal background, and generally portray you as<br />\nhighly desirable for employment. Hopefully, you could<br />\ndrop fifty of these in the mail (covered by a brief<br />\ninquiry) and have a chance of getting a nibble. Specific<br />\nresume forms can be found in library reference. Be sure<br />\nto use the largest type size you can when typing it up or<br />\nhaving it prepared for you.<br />\nHand in glove with the resume is the interviewing<br />\nprocess. The ability to well in an interview is somewhat<br />\ninstinctual. You have to establish a rapport with the<br />\ninterviewer, but it's more than personal chemistry,<br />\nbreath mints, and a neat haircut. Interviewers generally<br />\nfollow a pattern (remember, some of them do this eight<br />\nhours a day). Typical questions are: What would you<br />\nlike to be doing five years from now? (My answer: in a<br />\npolicy-making position); why do you think you'll be<br />\ngood in this job? (think fast); what is your greatest<br />\nstrength? (don't exaggerate excessively); what is your<br />\ngreatest weakness? (be sincere, but don't say anything<br />\n<br />\nstupid). And ask intelligent questions of your own,<br />\nwhich reflect an understanding of the work environment and (if possible) the particular company you are<br />\napplying to. Nervousness during interviews is something<br />\nyou must deal with on you own, but if you are prepared<br />\nfor tough questions, and can verbalize your employment<br />\nvalue, you should do well. The more interviews you<br />\nhave, the better you'll become at selling yourself convincingly.<br />\nThe assumption throughout all this discussion of<br />\njob-seeking is that you need a job as soon as possible<br />\nbecause you need to support yourself. Most graduates<br />\ncertainly don't know what they want to do with their<br />\nlives, beyond get rich, famous, and frequently laid.<br />\nObviously, if you know what you want, you have an<br />\nadvantage in the effort to achieve it. But, I assume that<br />\nyou don't know what you want, and that your immediate goal is to put a roof above you and food on the<br />\ntable. In this light, a general strategy is to start somewhere and move to a management position on the basis<br />\nof your unique strengths as they operate in the particular job situation. The theory is that humanities majors<br />\nfrom Hopkins make good management people once they<br />\nget a little experience; but don't expect to work from<br />\nclerk to executive V.P. in eight months. And make sure<br />\nyou can distinguish between serving your apprenticeship<br />\nand beating your head against a brick wall.<br />\nAny management experience you've had during<br />\nprevious employment or extracurricular activities will<br />\nsubstantiate your claim to a position in the leadership<br />\ncadre. (Watering plants in the SAC office doesn't carry<br />\nmuch weight in this context.) But even peon jobs teach<br />\nyou something about management, because if you've<br />\never been mismanaged when you were an Indian, you'll<br />\nremember it when you become a chief. Some prospective employers like their future management people to be<br />\ncollege boys who have sweated out a summer at Bethlehem Steel, just because the blend of certification and<br />\nblue collar labor is a good one.<br />\nIn the long run (which is really beyond the scope<br />\nof this article) the B.A. Generalist can have a career<br />\nwhich is both financially and emotionally rewarding,<br />\nas well as satisfying to whatever philosophical needs you<br />\nmight have. President Muller suggested, in an article<br />\nwhich appeared in Newsweek a couple of years ago, that<br />\nvolunteer service was the key to utilizing the surplus of<br />\ncollege grads. The only flaw with this altruism is, as I<br />\nfound out first hand, that many times the volunteer<br />\norganizations don't want you unless you have skills<br />\nwhich are worth a lot on the job market. I tried to get<br />\ninto the Peace Corps for a year, and found that even<br />\nthey don't have much demand for English majors.<br />\nJob-hunting is the main feature of the Season in<br />\nHell which constitutes Post-Graduate Depression. The<br />\nnew social circle friends at work, school girlfriend or<br />\nboyfriend you keep around, school friends you stick<br />\nevolves haphazardly around the identity crisis<br />\nwith<br />\nwhich is most closely tied to career at this point. Like<br />\npuberty, graduation is a step from one phase of existence to another, and you can comfort yourself with the<br />\nthought that the months of self-doubt and scrambling<br />\nwill give was to a new personna which is stronger,<br />\ntougher, tried in the fire of adversity, and worthy of its<br />\nfuture success. Until the day that personna arrives, you<br />\ncan spend your IPost-Graduate Depression purging<br />\nyourself of unprofitable vanity and other assorted<br />\nbullshit you picked up in your college years.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10 FEBRUARY 2.2, 1980<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\nGRAD<br />\nCLUB<br />\n<br />\nWANTS<br />\n<br />\nYOU!!<br />\n<br />\nTO BE A<br />\nGRAD CLUB BARTENDER<br />\nPOSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK<br />\nNORMAL SHIFTS ARE 5 - 9 pm,9 - 2 am JUST ONCE A WEEK<br />\n<br />\nd<br />\n<br />\nCONTACT NEIL NELAN, DEPT.

Therefore, it was a bit surprising to hear of the<br />\nannouncement of a new show at the<br />\nGallery entitled \"African Image: Representations of the Black Throughout<br />\nHistory\", a supposedly comprehensive<br />\nsurvey of the portrayal of the black from<br />\nas early as the 15th century B.C. in<br />\nEgypt, to the present. The Walters does<br />\nnot usually devote itself to exhibits of<br />\nsuch broad scope and contemporary<br />\nsignificance. As it turns out, the show is<br />\na general disappointment, doomed by the<br />\nabsence of a distinct perspective--social,<br />\nartistic or otherwise, and a carelessness of<br />\narrangement and design which detracts<br />\nfrom any spirit the exhibit may evoke.<br />\nThe problem here is not that the<br />\nIn fact,<br />\nworks of art lack quality.<br />\n<br />\nthere are quite a few remarkable pieces,<br />\nincluding a sculpture (about 650 B.C.)<br />\nof King Senkamanisken of the early<br />\nAfrican kingdom of Kush, and a number<br />\nof medieval manuscript illuminations<br />\ndepicting the visitation of the Three Magi,<br />\nthe youngest of which is the Ethiopian<br />\nKing Caspar. As beautiful as many of<br />\nthese works may be, they appear to have<br />\nbeen chosen mainly to remind the viewer<br />\nthat Africans have indeed been around<br />\nfor quite a while, and that their presence<br />\nwas known long before their incorporation into the Western society. However, a<br />\nroom full of versions of the Adoration of<br />\nthe Magi.(some of which include Caspar<br />\nas a sublimal, hardly visible figure) does<br />\nlittle to tell us how the black was regarded in the Middle ages. Naturally, one<br />\nwould be hard pressed to find works that<br />\nwould do this appropriately, since blacks<br />\nare extremely rare in early European art;<br />\nfor this reason, there should have been<br />\nless emphasis on the earlier sections of<br />\nthe show, and more on works of the<br />\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nGericault's Head ofa Negro (1823-4); Mount's The Bones Player (1856).<br />\n<br />\nThe nineteenth century section is<br />\nperhaps the most impressive of the<br />\nexhibit, largely because of the relative<br />\nwealth of black-related art during this<br />\nperiod. Of special note are two works by<br />\nGericault, \"The Boxers\" and \"Head<br />\nof a Negro\", both of which suggest the<br />\nartist's sensitivity to the black man.<br />\nCharles Cordier's \"Bust of a Sengalese<br />\nWoman\" is a strikingly realistic work, and<br />\nfurther exemplifies the growing concern<br />\nin the 19th century for the depiction of<br />\nAfrican beauty. There are a number of<br />\nimpressive American works, including<br />\nThomas Waterman Wood's \"Moses, the<br />\nBaltimore News Vendor,\"which come<br />\nthe closest to rendering the black man in<br />\nhis social environment. Unfortunately,<br />\nthis portion of the exhibit ends all too<br />\nabruptly, and procedes to the twentieth<br />\ncentury, which is perhaps the greatest<br />\ndisappointment of the show. It consists<br />\nsolely of a series of 1970's photographs<br />\nby Baltimore photographer John Clark<br />\nMayden. While these are fine and very<br />\nsensitive works, and would on their own<br />\nconstitute an impressive personal exhibit,<br />\nthey are not an adequate representation<br />\nof the depiction of the black in this<br />\ncentury.. There is one painting by<br />\nThomas Hart Benton, at the entrance to<br />\nthe gallery, but this hardly makes up for<br />\nsuch a serious omission. It is especially<br />\nsurprising that the century in which<br />\nblacks attained their greatest recognition<br />\nis the least documented in the exhibit.<br />\n<br />\ncomprehensive perspective of the black<br />\nfrom the beginning of history, the curators of the exhibit have gone too far and<br />\nyet not far enough. They have taken a<br />\nmassively<br />\nchallenging<br />\nchronological<br />\nscope, so expansive that the exhibit could<br />\nnot possibly provide a full representation,<br />\nwhile limiting the ideological scope to<br />\nlittle more than the rendering of the<br />\nphysical features of black men and<br />\nwomen. Ironically, a display that should<br />\nhave asserted black pride does no more<br />\nthan acknowledge the existence of the<br />\nrace, which does not seem to be enough.<br />\nUpon leaving the show, one is not left<br />\nwith any distinct indication of where the<br />\nblack has been or where he is going.<br />\nWhether or not this was the intention of<br />\nthe show is unclear, as there is a blatant<br />\nlack of printed commentary; almost all of<br />\nthe written material is restricted to the<br />\nindividual placards, which often fail to<br />\nplace the work of art in proper perspective.<br />\nThe idea of an exhibit bringing<br />\ntogether portrayals of the black in art is<br />\nunique and worthwhile, but it could<br />\n\u2022have been done tar better justice in a<br />\nmore narrowly defined form, in which<br />\nonly the last two, or perhaps three<br />\ncenturies were taken into perspective. It<br />\nis unfortunate that a museum of such<br />\nexcellence as the Walters failed to recognize this necessity.<br />\nThe exhibit will be on display<br />\nthrougth March 30.<br />\n<br />\nIn thtir attempt to provide a<br />\n<br />\nYear's Saddest Comedy<br />\n<br />\nLast Couple Finishes...Last<br />\nBY ROSALIND RESNICK<br />\nThe Last Married Couple in<br />\nAmerica is, without a doubt, the saddest<br />\nmovie of the year, though perhaps<br />\n\"sorriest\" would be the more appropriate<br />\nadjective. Not only is the film poorly and<br />\nhastily made, with mediocre dialogue<br />\nand less-than-mediocre acting, it also<br />\nreveals a pathetic truth about the quality<br />\nof marriage in America--that couples have<br />\nmore in common with the movie's<br />\nsuperficial characters than Hollywood<br />\nwould have us believe.<br />\nDespite its apocalyptic title, The<br />\nCouple in America has<br />\nMarried<br />\nLast<br />\nnothing to do with science fiction.<br />\n<br />\nf.',ega an<br />\n<br />\nRather, it takes place in modern day<br />\nCalifornia, the hotbed of \"police strikes,<br />\nwomen's lib, gay lib, and condominiums,\" about which the movie's married,<br />\nseparated, and divorced couples constantly moan. The opening scene is a touchfootball game in a luxuriant, suburban<br />\npark. At first, four or five middle-aged<br />\ncouples split into teams and bicker<br />\ngood-naturedly. But as the movie unfolds, the couples allow their bickering<br />\n(mostly about sexual jealously and<br />\nrepression) to turn into divorce. Two by<br />\ntwo they leave the game, just like ten<br />\nlittle Indians.<br />\nThe protagonists of this modern<br />\ndrama are Jeff(George Segal) and Maurie<br />\n<br />\noo : a toas. o mcnogamy... or monotony.<br />\n<br />\n(Natalie Wood). They are the heroes<br />\nbecause they remain married while all<br />\ntheir friends separate or get divorced.<br />\nThough Jeff and Maurie are just as<br />\nsuperficial as their swinging friends, they<br />\nmanage to encounter enough negative<br />\nrole models to convince themselves that<br />\nmarriage, while it may be boring, sexually<br />\nunstimulating, and definitely un-chic, is<br />\nbetter than the \"liberation\" of the<br />\nsingle world--a world of loneliness, casual<br />\nsex, and orgies with people outside your<br />\nclose circle of friends. Jeff and Maurie<br />\nsplit up because Maurie gets gonnorhea<br />\nfrom Jeff, who has been pressured into<br />\nscrewing a woman who won't take \"no\"<br />\nfor an answer, and each takes a young<br />\nlover to make the other jealous. They<br />\nreunite in a melodramatic bedroom scene<br />\nin which a swinging wife from San Diego<br />\nstrips and then suddenly realizes that she<br />\nhas had enough orgies and \"doesn't know<br />\nwhat love-making means any more.\"<br />\nIt is then that Jeff and Maurie decide that<br />\nmarried life wasn't so bad after all.<br />\nIt is unclear whether The Last<br />\nMarried Couple is supposed to be taken as<br />\na serious social statement, a farce, or<br />\nboth. All the characters are stereotypes<br />\n(e.g., the super-aggressive woman who has<br />\nhad her vagina tightened, the plumber<br />\nwho makes pornographic movies and is<br />\nmarried--for the fourth time\u2014to a prostitute), and eyery line of dialogue sounds<br />\nlike it comes from a bad soap opera.<br />\nMost of these lines are recited mechanically, and the long, heart-felt speeches<br />\nhave the ring of Playboy's party jokes.<br />\nGeorge Segal's amazingly plastic face\u2014<br />\nso. unassumingly beguiling in his other<br />\n<br />\nCoupe um es t ,e pass.<br />\nmovies--is here almost gruesome. Natalie<br />\nWood's ever shapely legs (which she<br />\nshows to advantage in several revealing<br />\nskirts) are the best part of her performance.<br />\nBut, if this movie falls flat as<br />\nfarce, (intentionally or not) it reveals<br />\nmuch as social commentary. Many of<br />\nthose in our parents' generation, raised<br />\nwith one set of values and exposed to<br />\nanother while raising their own chiPrep,<br />\nnow feel cheated out of the rewards of<br />\nboth worlds. To make up for lost time,<br />\nmany are now discarding spouses and<br />\nchildren in a vain search to \"find them- \u2022<br />\nselves\"\u2014a journey that often leads to<br />\nunhappiness. At its most effective, The<br />\nLast Married Couple reali.3&aily porlravs<br />\nthese people, who often appear ridiculous<br />\n. The<br />\nin their bewildering corninertyr.<br />\ncharacters in the movie have<br />\nselves over into rigid \"new imavs\" in<br />\nwhich few are really happy. They are<br />\nobsessed with marriage, divorce, 2nd sex,<br />\nand discuss nothing else; they blindly<br />\nfollow the \"swinger\" lifestyle so clearly<br />\noutlined in trendy magazines; and they<br />\nare swept up in the contagious fad of<br />\ndivorce.

The<br />\nBlue Jays had a difficult time<br />\n'getting their offense going and<br />\nwere unable to defend successfully against the opposition's<br />\nquick passes and inside shots.<br />\nThe loss brought the team's<br />\nrecord to 4-11.<br />\nThe most exciting game of<br />\nthe season was played last<br />\nMonday night against Coppin<br />\n+State. After falling behind by<br />\nsix points the Jays rallied back<br />\nto take the lead. The team was<br />\nup by as many as 16 points<br />\nduring the first half but watched<br />\nCoppin fight back and tie the<br />\ngame with just over one minute<br />\nto play. With a tenacious full<br />\ncourt press, the Jays held on and<br />\nthe game went into overtime. In<br />\nthis final period Sue Tyler came<br />\nthrough with 6 of her game-high<br />\n22 points to lead the team to a<br />\nCarol Hahn,<br />\n63<br />\n,-61 victory.<br />\nGiteryl Baron and Bonnie Garner<br />\nwere all in double figures. The<br />\nfull court press and the balanced<br />\nscoring proved too much for<br />\nCoppin to handle.<br />\nBeing a successful athlete<br />\nmeans striving to sharpen one's<br />\nskills as well as developing the<br />\nmental attitude that is necessary<br />\nto be a team player.

Sue<br />\nTyler had a successful year as<br />\nthe layup expert of the team<br />\nwhen she wasn't busy wiping out<br />\nthe opposition. Strong rebounding and tough defense by Cheryl<br />\n\"Boom Boom\" Baron and<br />\nMartha Heyman gave the team a<br />\nsecond and third shot at the<br />\nhoop. At center, Bonnie Garner<br />\nand Caitlin Griffith added height<br />\nand a smooth inside shot that<br />\npleased the fans. At guard,<br />\nKathleen King amazed everyone<br />\nwith her outside \"bombs\" that<br />\nswished through the hoop.<br />\nFreshman guard Kim Stevens<br />\nsurprised the opposition with<br />\nher numerous steals and a<br />\nconsistent shot.<br />\nCoach Donna Seegar and<br />\nassistant Bill Richardson were<br />\npleased with the attitude of the<br />\nteam. Coach Seegar praised the<br />\nflexibility of the team members<br />\nin being able to shift positions in<br />\nthe middle of the season as well<br />\nas in the middle of a game. She<br />\nfeels that the team could have<br />\nwon more of the contests but<br />\nacknowledges that this year<br />\nhas been a building year for the<br />\nteam.

Averaging twenty-five turnovers a game, Hopkins was<br />\nout-rebounded by every opponent and shot poorly from the<br />\nfield and the foul line, 45.3%<br />\nand 63.6%, respectively.<br />\nHopkins' bad luck and<br />\ninconsistent play, a problem<br />\nduring the entire season, continued as the Blue Jays lost all<br />\neight of their last contests.<br />\nIn their final game of the season,<br />\nHopkins succumbed to Washington College in double overtime,<br />\n79-71. The Jays played with<br />\ngreat intensity and certainly did<br />\nnot look like a 3-19 team. Tom<br />\nTessitore led the team in scoring<br />\nwith 21 points, the majority of<br />\nthem coming from the foul line,<br />\nwhere he shot 11 for 13. Scott<br />\nBarr chipped in with 14 points.<br />\nA similar outcome marked<br />\nthe game against Haverford. In a<br />\nclose, but not well played game,<br />\nHopkins lost 63-59. The Jays<br />\nstayed close throughout the<br />\ngame, as thcy tried to avenge a<br />\nprevious 76-72 loss to Haverford.<br />\nIn their two games prior to<br />\nthe Haverford contest, Hopkins<br />\nwas soundly defeated by both<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, 85-53,<br />\nand Widener, 65-48. Against<br />\nWidener, Hopkins shot poorly<br />\nform the start, falling behind<br />\n30-9.

However, the Jays never got any<br />\ncloser, as Widener employed a<br />\nstall, slowing the game down.<br />\nCoach Jim Amen summed<br />\nup the season as a large disappointment. He pointed out the<br />\nteam had several tough losses:<br />\none point losses to the Merchant<br />\nMarine and York, two four point<br />\nlosses to Haverford, a two point<br />\nloss to Ursinus and a doubleovertime defeat at the hands of<br />\nWashington. Nevertheless, after<br />\nenjoying only seven of forty-five<br />\ngames in the past two years, the<br />\nteam needs a great deal of help.<br />\nCoach Amen feels the team<br />\nneeds a rebounder (to take the<br />\nheat off Tom Tessitore and Dan<br />\nJackson, who are shooting forwards), a man who can put the<br />\nball in the basket at least 50% of<br />\n<br />\nthe time, and someone who can<br />\nrun the offense and penetrate<br />\ninside. He feels the team has<br />\nsuffered from the lack of a guard<br />\nwho can shoot from the outside,<br />\na deficiency which has permitted<br />\nopposition defenses to sag inside, making it difficult for<br />\nHopkins to move the ball inside.<br />\nOnce again, the team was<br />\nled in scoring by Dan Jackson,<br />\nwho finished with a 14.8 point<br />\naverage. Jackson, who at one.<br />\npoint was averaging almost f7<br />\npoints per contest, found it<br />\nharder to score during the<br />\nsecond half of the season.<br />\nJackson also led the team in<br />\nrebounding and blocked shots.<br />\nScott Kautz, who became the<br />\nplaymaker during the second<br />\nhalf of the season, led the team<br />\nin steals and assists, but failed to<br />\npenetrate and score.<br />\n<br />\nFencers Prepare For<br />\n80 MAC Title Bout<br />\nThe Hopkins fencing team<br />\nhas reversed its recent string of<br />\ndefeats during the past two<br />\nweeks with a trio of wins over a<br />\nvariety of opponents. After an<br />\nembarassing 17-10 loss'to Haverford, the Jays managed three<br />\ncome-from behind victories<br />\nagainst U.M.B.C., Seton Hall,<br />\nand Rutgers-Newark. With one<br />\ndual meet left in their 1979-80<br />\ncampaign, the fencers are now<br />\n14-6.<br />\nTwo weeks ago, Hopkins<br />\nstarted badly by losing to<br />\nHaverford. In that meet, everybody on the Blue Jay squad<br />\nseemed'to fence below ability.<br />\nAgainst U.M.B.C., the fencers<br />\nto have trouble<br />\nseemed<br />\ngetting started, but found the<br />\nright combinnation in time to<br />\npick up a narrow 14-13 victory.<br />\nThe next week, Hopkins<br />\nsurvived two tough meets against<br />\nRutgers and Seton Hall. Julian<br />\nMcCarthy of Seton Hall remarked how much they had been<br />\npreparing for the meet with<br />\nHopkins<br />\nThZir preparation<br />\nshowed, as Hopkins fell behind<br />\nboth teams 11-10, before winn-<br />\n<br />\ning both meets 15-12. The<br />\nmeets were run simultaneously<br />\nand the final outcome of both<br />\ncontests was in doubt until the<br />\nvery end.<br />\nCoach Oles, discussing last<br />\nweek's performance, stated that<br />\n\"For the first time in two weeks,<br />\nwe fenced up to par. We ended<br />\na crisis of confidence and did all<br />\nthis without our number two<br />\nsabreman.\" He was referring to<br />\nAlan Benheim, who has been out<br />\nfor the past 3 weeks. Oles also<br />\nnoted that in the last rounds of<br />\nthe Seton Hall and Rutgers<br />\nmeets,\"we cleaned up, going 6-3<br />\nand 7-2\".<br />\nThe Jays are now looking<br />\nforward to the Middle Atlantic<br />\nChampionship meet to be held<br />\nSunday at George Mason. A lot<br />\nis riding on this year's championship. Hopkins is the defending champion, as well as the<br />\noverall champion.

Considers Constitution<br />\nBY PETER CINQUEGRANI<br /><br />\nStudent Council deliberates on the proposed Adjudicatory Code.<br /><br />\nA proposed new Student<br />\nCouncil Constitution was unveiled<br />\nat Wednesday night's Council<br />\nmeeting by SC Vice-President<br />\nBarbara Squires. The constitution was written by Squires,<br />\nSid<br />\nSecretary<br />\nCouncil<br />\nGoodfriend, and Junior Class<br />\nPresident Mike Steele.<br />\nThe idea for a new constitution arose at a Council meeting<br />\nlast year, when an examination<br />\nof the constitution was made to<br /><br />\nStudent Council Hearing Debate<br />\nOn ProposedAd'udicator Code<br />\nBY SUNITA HANJURA<br />\nThe continued discussion of<br />\nthe Undergraduate Adjudicatory<br />\nCode comprised most of the<br />\nStudent Council's Feb. 20 meeting.<br />\nAt this point, the University<br />\nPeDemi Counsel, Estelle Fishbein, has had a chance to comment on the Code, and her<br />\nobjections fall into two main<br />\ncategories: a) aspects of the<br />\nCode that are illegal and must be<br />\nchanged; b) items she dislikes<br />\nand recommends the Council<br />\nmodify or change.<br />\nKaren Loebel opened the<br />\ndiscussion by asking that the<br />\nCouncil define what the Code<br />\nThe<br />\nhas jurisdiction over.<br />\nUniversity General Counsel proposed stating that the Code have<br />\njurisdiction over crimes 1)<br />\nagainst University property; 2)<br /><br />\nagainst a person affiliated with<br />\nthe University; and 3) against<br />\nthe property of a member of the<br />\nThe<br />\nUniversity community.<br />\nCode previously said that jurisdiction should be determined by<br />\nBaltimore City, Maryland state<br />\nand Federal law.<br />\nSid Goodfriend opposed<br />\ndefining jurisdiction in such a<br />\nHe contended that<br />\nmanner.<br />\nsetting such guidelines will mean<br />\nthat the Code lacks a set procedure. Arguing that \"the ac-cused and the accuser should<br />\nknow what the're getting into\"<br />\nbeforehand, Goodfriend's main<br />\nobjection was that similar cases<br />\nmay be viewed differently in<br />\ntwo consecutive years, depending on who is on the Adjudicatory Board.<br />\nIn favor of changing the<br />\nclassification of what jurisdiction includes, Connolly said that<br /><br />\nthe Council needs to adopt a<br />\nCode to fulfill the needs of the<br />\ncommunity. Connolly proposed<br />\nthat jurisdiction \"arise out of<br />\naffiliation with the University<br />\ncommunity,\" and that damage<br />\nmust be proved. The Counsel<br />\nchose not to define exactly what<br />\nconstitutes the \"University<br />\nConnolly's<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nmotion was approved by the<br />\nmajority in an informal vote.<br />\nAnother major point of<br />\ndiscussion was whether the hearing should remain private. The<br />\nCouncil ran through a gamut of<br />\npros and cons on this issue.<br />\nThe basic argument was that<br />\ncertain Council members challenge the stipulation that the<br />\naccused have the sole right to<br />\ndicide whether a meeting be<br />\nopened. Goodfriend suggested<br />\nthat the defendant and the<br />\n\u2022 cont. on p.5<br /><br />\nMaryland's College Republicans<br />\nOpen Meeting Here Tomorrow<br /><br />\ndetermine whether an Election<br />\nCommission could be formed to<br />\ntry to z-illevia i.e recurring probems<br />\nwith Student Council and class<br />\nofficer elections. According to<br />\nSquires, \"since we were looking<br />\nat the Constitution, we noticed<br />\nsome other things that needed<br />\nchanges.\"<br />\nSquires reported that the<br />\nmajor alterations considered<br />\nnecessary were for clarification<br />\nof procedt ral questions and a<br />\nsystemization of the voting<br />\nstructure. She commented that<br />\nthere seemed to be no pattern in<br />\nthe old constitution governing<br />\nthe number of votes necessary<br />\nfor the Council to approve such<br />\naction as the recall of appointed<br />\nofficers, closing meetings and<br />\nthe impeachment of Council<br />\nmembers. She added that it was<br />\noften difficult to determine any<br />\nset figure for the number of<br /><br />\nvotes needed to approve actions.<br />\nSquires noted that there<br />\nwere problems with Committee<br />\nstructure that the Council hoped<br />\nto correct with the new constitution.<br />\nwas<br />\nquestion<br />\nAnother<br />\nwhether missing two Council<br />\nmeetings was sufficient grounds<br />\nfor expulsion from the SC.<br />\nwas<br />\nConstitution<br />\nThe<br />\nwritten over Intersession after<br />\nagreement by the Council that<br />\nthat would be a good time to get<br />\nit finished. Having planned to<br />\nstay at Hopkins over Intersession, Squires volunteered for the<br />\nwork. The opportunity to assist<br />\nher was offered to any Council<br />\nmember who was interested and<br />\nwould be here. Both Steele and<br />\nGoodfriend volunteered to help.<br />\nSquires emphasized that<br />\nthis document w:is not in its<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br /><br />\nMSE Staff Fights Lice<br />\nIn Ladies' Lavatories<br />\nBY MARK TRACHTENBERG<br />\nThe restrooms in the Milton<br />\nS.

The Academic Council has directed CUS to<br />\nreview the report submitted by<br />\nthe Curriculum Review Committee (CRC) at the end of last<br />\nDecember. CUS will hold several<br />\nmeetings in March to examine<br />\nthe CRC report before making<br />\ntheir recommendations to the<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\nElkin feels that the scope of<br /><br />\nthe report as it now stands is<br />\nmuch narrower than it was<br />\noriginally. Although the CRC<br />\ndid deal with some specific<br />\nproblems, such as course<br />\nrequirements, advising and Intersession, it did not provide a<br />\ncomprehensive _discussion of the<br />\nUniversity's responsibility to its<br />\nstudents. The Education Committee hopes to raise student<br />\nconsciousness and generate<br />\ninterest in the quality of education at Hopkins by providing<br />\nforums for discussion, according<br />\nto Elkin.<br />\n\"This is a university where<br />\nfaculty autonomy and independence is maintained and<br />\nfought for very hard,\" said<br />\nElkin. He believes therefore<br />\nthat it is necessary for students<br />\nto be aware of and concerned<br />\nwith the academic atmosphere<br />\nprovided at JHU. \"This is an<br /><br />\nRobert Elkin<br />\nimportant period at Hopkins,\"<br />\nElkin said. \"We are being presented with the chance to make<br />\nsubstantive changes in the direction of education offered here.\"<br /><br />\nV-P Squires Explains<br />\nConstitution Needs<br />\ncont. from p. /<br />\nprovisions<br />\nthe<br />\nconcerning<br />\nfinal form asnd would almost by-laws of the Constitution.<br />\ncertainly be amended by the<br />\nUnder the current ConstituCouncil during debate on its tion a Council member can only<br />\npassage.

Again.<br />\nUnfortunately, the only response<br />\nthis fact has elicited from most Hopkins<br />\nstudents has been a resounding \"So<br />\nwhat?\" Undergraduates here are notorious for having only the sketchiest knowledge of Baltimore, but unfamiliarity with<br />\na valuable part of one's own university<br />\nwhich lies only twenty blocks away is not<br />\neasily excusable. The fact of the matter is<br />\nthat if Peabody ceases to exist, the<br />\nabsence will be sorely felt by all of<br />\nHopkins, and we will have lost a rare asset<br />\nand fine opportunity.<br />\nWe will not dwell on the great<br />\nintrinsic merits of supporting an institution the caliber of Peabody, because, for<br />\none reason or another, such arguments<br />\nseem to have little persuasive power on<br />\nthis campus. Instead, we will take a<br />\npurely selfish approach and ask \"What can<br />\nPeabody do for Homewood?\"<br />\nFor one thing, it can help to<br />\ndiscredit the image Hopkins has as a<br />\nmonolithic pre-med factory. Despite the<br />\nmany strong Humanities departments<br />\nhere, most outsiders still assume that<br />\nanyone attending Hopkins wants to be a<br />\ndoctor. Having a world-famous conservatory connected to the University might go<br />\nfar toward softening our distorted, hard\u2014<br />\nscience image.<br />\nIt is a truism that Hopkins is a sec-<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nond-choice haven for Ivy League also-rans.<br />\nHopkins seems to be the place where<br />\nundergrads who couldn't quite make it into<br />\nPrinceton wind up. One of the factors<br />\nwhich make Ivy League schools so revered<br />\nis that they possess excellent institutions<br />\nwhich are distinct from their basic Arts &amp;<br />\nSciences curriculum:<br />\nHarvard Law,<br />\nYale Divinity, etc. In Peabody, Hopkins<br />\nhas just such an \"Ivy League\" asset. A<br />\ntop-notch conservatory, in conjunction<br />\nwith the existing top-notch School of<br />\nMedicine, can put to rest many of the<br />\nexcuses employed to keep Hopkins<br />\nout of the first eschelon of American<br />\nuniversities.<br />\nPart of the reason for student<br />\napathy is that the great resources of<br />\nPeabody are not being handled properly.<br />\nThe concerts, most of them free, are not<br />\nwell publicized at Homewood, and<br />\nthe many different types of music which<br />\nPeabody students perform has not been<br />\nstressed. Why, for instance, hasn't the<br />\nJazz Ensemble performed any we<br />\n*NO<br />\ndates at the Rat or the Glass Pavilion? A-if<br />\nlittle more contact between aspiring !.<br />\nmuscicians and pre-meds might break<br />\ndown the popular notion that they are<br />\ntwo groups who inhabit mutually exclusive worlds.<br />\nWe strongly support all efforts to<br />\nobtain, state financial assistance for the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory.<br />\n/<br /><br />\nPhoto Staff<br /><br />\n(Letters To The Editor<br /><br />\nPeter Choo<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nAnne McElwee<br /><br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nTex Naim<br />\nPhilip Schutzer<br /><br />\n1 eI I i<br /><br />\nProduction Staff<br />\nJeff Adelman<br />\nChris Hurley<br />\nDeborah Jones<br />\nP.J.

At<br />\nthe beginning of this semester,<br />\nthe editorial staff of the N-L was<br />\ngiven a similar privilege with<br />\nthe reinstatement of a column<br />\ncalled \"Opinion.\" Each week an<br />\neditor or a staff member is<br />\nresponsible on a rotating basis<br />\nfor filling this space with his or<br />\nher opinion. The column is<br />\nsigned, which indicates to the<br />\nreader that the author alone is<br />\nresponsible for the article, and<br />\nthat the opinions are solely his<br />\n(or her, in this case) own.<br />\nNow that the status of this<br />\nstatement, as well as that of<br />\nlettters to the Editor, has<br />\nbeen established, let me ask a<br />\nquestion. Who wrote that article<br />\ndirectly above and to the right<br />\nof mine? A surprisingly large<br />\namount of people think that the<br />\narticle in question, commonly<br />\nreferred to as an editorial, is the<br />\nopinion of the entire editorial<br /><br />\nstaff. Plausible hypothesis. But<br />\nlet me ask another question. If<br />\nthe editorial expresses my<br />\nopinions, as well as those of my<br />\ncolleagues, what need have we<br />\nfor the space set aside for<br />\n\"Opinion\"?<br />\nA misconception obviously<br />\nexists here which I feel responsible to clear up. The editorial<br />\ndoes not express (as it did in the<br />\npast) the view of the entire<br />\neditorial staff; in fact it does not<br />\nexpress the views of part of the<br />\neditorial staff. To be frank, I<br />\ndon't even know what the<br />\neditorial is going to be until I see<br />\nthe paper Friday morning.<br />\nI am not trying to find fault<br />\nwith the editorials written by<br />\nour Editor-In-Chief, Cates Baldridge; on the contrary, I believe<br />\nthat they are for the most part<br />\nintelligent, well-written opinions. My complaint is that they<br />\nare his opinions, not mine, and<br />\njust as I am responsible for<br />\nidentifying the author of my<br />\nviews, I feel he sould be likewise<br />\nobligated.

(BDM has<br />\ngrown an average 30 percent per<br />\nyear for the past 7 years.)<br /><br />\n2.\"Why is corporate growth<br />\nso important?\"<br />\nStrong corporate growth means that<br />\nthe opportunity for personal career<br />\ngrowth is much greater than in a<br />\nmore static organization.(Graduates<br />\nwho joined BDM two years ago have<br />\nmoved far ahead of their counterparts in most other organizations.)<br /><br />\n3.\"Why should I join a professional services company?\"<br /><br />\nbecome a service economy.

I think that sponsoring<br />\nan event where a woman sells<br />\nher body to a probably drunk<br />\nand somewhat pressured student<br />\nis carrying the idea of sexual<br />\nfreedom a bit too far. By<br />\nplacing the assault on stripper<br />\nnight in the same context as<br />\nwitch burnings and literature<br />\nbans, Mr. Ebsworth seems to<br />\nexpect people to pity the<br />\npoor frats who are being unfairly<br />\nassaulted for having a little fun.<br />\nIt doesn't take a puritanical<br />\nmorality to see that there's<br />\nsomething inherently degrading<br />\nabout prostitution, and to try<br />\nand shroud it in rhetoric about<br />\nfreedom of expression clouds<br />\nthe real issue.<br />\nWhat is most annoying<br />\nabout Mr. Ebsworth's letter is<br />\nthe way he trys to treat the<br />\nentire event as a joke by assuming that those who were against<br />\nthe stripper-prostitutes were<br />\nmerely frustrated individuals.<br />\nHe writes, \"As an expedient<br />\nrelease for their tensions, nothing beats the indignant adoption<br />\nof a trivial cause, especially if it<br />\nallows one to condemn the<br />\nminor recreations of those who<br />\nseem to be having more fun.\"<br />\nBy calling prostitution \"trivial\",<br />\nEbsworth callously neglects the<br />\nfact that we are talking about a<br />\nperson, and not merely a sexual<br />\ntoy to be exploited.<br />\nEven if both parties consent, the frats involved are still<br />\ntaking advantage of a social<br />\nproblem which they can't ignore<br />\nwhen sponsoiing such events.

The big day has finally arrived.<br />\nYour extended childhood is over, and you're ready to<br />\nassume a place in the \"Real World.\" And because<br />\nyou're a JHU grad, you expect to assume a significant<br />\nplace. In other words, a degree from mighty Johns<br />\nHopkins guarantees success.<br />\nThis may be the way it works for some people,<br />\nbut for other bonafide Hopkins men and women, Ringo<br />\nStarr's song says it all. This article, written as it is by<br />\na '78 Hopkins grad, is designed to advise graduating<br />\nseniors concerning the months after graduation, which<br />\ncan be a tough time for most people.<br />\nI hope the ideas and realities discussed here will<br />\nbe reassuring, or at least informative, to those who<br />\ngraduate and find that success does not fall into one's<br />\nlap. The Alumni Association will ask for dues, and the<br />\nperson responsible for getting funds from your class will<br />\ntry to milk money from you for the old alma mater, and<br />\nyou'll get those forms to fill out which ask you what<br />\nyour position is (dishwasher?), but no Hopkins official is<br />\ngoing to come down off his/her throne to tell you that<br />\nHopkins grads are not \"can't miss\" overnite sensations.<br />\nBelieve me, the Placement Office is only helpful if you<br />\ndon't need its assistance in the first place. Besides, they<br />\ntold you when you applied that you shouldn't come<br />\nhere unless you knew what you wanted to do.<br />\nThere are two groups of people for whom the<br />\ninformation presented here is not particularly relevant.<br />\nPeople who are (1) going directly on to grad school; and<br />\n(2) engineers and the like people who get great (17-20 K<br />\nper annum) jobs right away. Such folks will probably<br />\nnot experience that great change of life crisis which<br />\nbegins when one walks out of the hallowed halls of the<br />\nivory tower with a BA or BS, a crisis known as Post-Graduate Depression.<br />\nPost-Graduate Depression is a malaise which is<br />\nalmost never fatal, but it's damned uncomfortable while<br />\nit lasts -- and that may be a year or two. For most, it<br />\ncan last at least a summer. PGD, as we might call it,<br />\ninvolves the dawning realization that one has been thrust<br />\ninto a game with rules which differ from those of<br />\ncollege. The young man who lounges so cavalierly in<br />\nfront of Levering with his tattered jeans and free-style<br />\nhair, puffing on a joint, will find that the admiration his<br />\ncare-free actions generate on campus is not to be found<br />\nin the Real World. There is no more tragic sight than the<br />\nBig Man On Campus who one apring struts across his<br />\nturf like a sexual tycoon, while the next finds him<br />\ncowering in some executive's office with a fresh haircut,<br />\ngroveling for a job.<br /><br />\nPost-Graduate Depression is usually over when the<br />\nsubject has adapted to the Real World, i.e. is self-supporting, and has adjusted his/her social life to the<br />\nworking routine. The transformation is tough, because<br />\nthe job market is crowded. And if you're a white male,<br />\nyour shot at a good management track program is cut<br />\nby, say, 2/3, because those women who were once<br />\ncontent to be secretaries, and those minorities who once<br />\nnever made it to college, want a slice of your action with a vengeance. That realization doesn't make your<br />\nego feel any better when the days are long and lean.<br />\nAdjusting socially is as tough as getting the job.<br />\nFirst, you can't party until four in the morning and then<br />\nsleep through that ten o'clock class. Chronic absenteeism can blight your budding career pronto. Not only<br />\nthat, but after you graduate, you find you can't hang<br />\nout in front of Levering, or in the Rat, Library, coffee<br />\nshop, or other former favorite haunts, without attracting<br />\nthe goading question, \"What are you doing here?\" I<br />\nswear that I have encountered this question almost every<br />\ntime I've been on campus since that September in '78<br />\nwhen I glumly closed my Gilman bank account(low on<br />\nfunds) as the cheery underclassmen returned. The<br />\nquestion is irritating in any case, because it implies<br />\n(correctly) that you're no longer \"one of us.\" And if<br />\nyou have a lousy job or no job, you don't want to field<br />\nthe inevitable questions about what you're doing with<br />\nyour life, especially if those questions are tossed at you<br />\nby some bright-eyes undergrad who wields the whip<br />\ninnocently but effectively. I mean, you already have<br />\nyour dad telling you to \"get a job\" and asking \"Why do<br />\nyou think I spent a fortune putting you through<br />\nschool?\"<br />\nSee what I mean? When you graduate, you have<br />\na new social status and role as surely as a man in nineteenth century America who is suddenly transmogrified<br />\nfrom white to black. And the people who aren't standing in your shoes will not give a shit about your predicament. Those who haven't gotten this far don't know<br />\nwhat you're going through, and those who have already<br />\npassed this stage don't want much to do with anyone<br />\nwho is going through \"that stage.\" Those who have<br />\nsuccessfully resisted the urge to become a leftist during<br />\nschool sometimes succumb in the midst of Post-Graduate Depression. They thus suddenly stumble onto a<br />\ndandy new make-shift philosophy -\"Hey, everybody<br />\nought to have a job!\" This usually lasts until capitalism<br />\nhas mercy on them and gives them a place in the sun,at<br />\nwhich point they abandon their foolish ideas and completely forget about everyone back in the ringer.<br />\nOne good label for this new status and role is<br />\n\"B.A. Generalist.\" This phrase, devised by the Peace<br />\nCorps, classifies people who have a college degree but<br />\ndon't really know how to do anything which is marketable. This is the group which usually receives the full<br />\nimpact of Post-Graduate Depression. For these, of which<br />\nI was one, there aren't a lot of alternatives. The fact<br />\nthat one was, say, the smartest kid in one's High School<br />\ndoesn't mean doodly-squat in the job market.

(This is where the guys<br />\nwho were a lot dumber than you in high school get their<br />\nlong-a-waited revenge as they watch you squirm.) B.A.<br />\nGeneralists, excluding those who postpone the issue or<br />\nresolve it by going immediately to grad school, often<br />\nface the agonffing situation of being overqualified for<br />\nthe position they wind up in after graduation, and often<br />\nfeel that they are not using a great deal of their potential. This feeling of under-achievement is perhaps the<br />\nbitterest part of Post-Graduate Depression. One wit<br />\nquipped that the paycheck is life's report card, and for<br />\nthe person who's used to getting high grades at Hopkins,<br />\nthe drop in G.P.A. is usually pretty discouraging.

You have to<br />\naccept the fact that you're going to have to start on the<br />\nfirst rung of the ladder and prove that your intelligence<br />\nis good for something besides high grades. And emploY.<br />\ners often shy away from people who are fresh out of<br />\nschool (unless they have a marketable skill) because<br />\nnobody wants to be the one to break in the greenhorns.<br />\nThe situation I'm outlining is the worst possible<br />\none for the normal graduate: (1) You don't have all<br />\nimmediately marketable skill(How, you lash at yourself,<br />\ndid I let myself get into this mess?);(2) You're too sick<br />\nof school to go on to grad school, even though addition'<br />\nal certification means something; (3) You don't have,<br />\na \"connection\" who can land you that great job;(4)<br />\nYou need money, i.e. can't afford to screw around for a<br />\nyear or two while living off Dad or some other charitabl:No<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nI guess the first thing to do is figure out where<br />\nyou want to live when you leave Hopkins. Do you want<br />\nto live near campus, move back to your home town, or III<br />\njust (hardest of all) move to a different city where Y\u00b0L1<br />\ndon't know anybody? Do you want to more back wit'',<br />\nyour parents for a while?

It's not like you<br />\ncan bring a young lady to your parents' home, get high<br />\nand then flatten a matress with her. I lived with my<br />\nparents for a four and a half month period after graduation, and it was really tough for everybody.

You may want to live out in<br />\nthe country, but the employment situation there is nil.<br />\nFarmers are not in the market for college bred management trainees \u2014 at least, not usually. Most people<br />\nsacrifice clean air for proximity to a highly populated<br />\narea with more jobs, or they are prepared for a long<br />\ncommute every day, a wearisome and potentially dangerous (in light of the energy situation) plan. D.C. is a<br />\ngood example: the crime is really bad, and it's crowded,<br />\ntAit anybody can land some kind of white collar job<br />\nthere sooner or later. You just try to be careful and<br />\nforget about the sexual assault that occured on the<br />\nsubway during rush hour. And if you're willing to spend<br />\na couple hours a day on public transportation, and if<br />\nYou can stand living in squalor in the wealthiest county<br />\nIn the country, you can settle in beautiful Silver Spring.<br />\nChecking out the want ads is probably your next<br />\nstep, once you've decided where you're going to locate.<br />\nThey're a crude vehicle for finding a job, but the person<br />\nWithout contacts doesn't have many other ways of<br />\ndiscovering job opportunities. Very rarely does it happen<br />\nthat a friend notifies you of a great job opportunity<br />\nWhich doesn't interest him. Want ads are a long shot,<br />\nbut they can come through, so they are at least worthy<br />\nof examination. Reading the classified help wanted ads<br /><br />\ninvariably depressed me, but I guess that's just an<br />\noccupational hazard.<br />\nGoing to an employment agency is a good<br />\nmaneuver, because it gives you a foothold. You've got a<br />\ncounselor whose livelihood depends on getting you a<br />\njob, and he or she has contacts, and can set up interviews. Even if the interviews aren't good ones, they<br />\nprovide good experience in the art of selling yourself.<br />\nYou will probably be interviewed for jobs as an insurance salesman, manager of a Burger King, or file clerk,<br />\nbut what the heck. There are only two catches. The<br />\nfirst is that it may take you awhile before you recognize<br />\nthat your counselor is incompetent, and can switch<br />\nagencies. The second is that a job which is not fee paid<br />\nis going to consume a lot of your first paychecks.<br />\nEmployment agencies usually take 10-12% of your<br />\nannual salary for a non-fee paid job, and they take<br />\nit in the first ninety days of your employment. That's<br />\nrough. But on the other hand, there are lots of fee paid<br />\njobs (the employer pays the 10-12%) and half-fee paid<br />\njobs(half as bad as a non-fee paid job).<br />\nTrying to get a job with the Government is worth<br />\na try, because Government positions are usually pretty<br />\ncomfortable for the B. A. Generalist. The Professional<br />\nCareer Administrative Examination(PACE)is the test to<br />\ntake. Make sure you register in time, because it's only<br />\ngiven a couple of times a year. (And find out what<br />\n\"AI71\" is -- the basic form for applying to federal agencies for employment). But a good score on this board<br />\ntest will land you a Government job that virtually<br />\nguarantees steady promotion. One Hopkins girl got a<br />\n100 on this test, and got dozens of job offers. On the<br />\nother hand, if you get less than a ninety, better intensify<br />\nelsewhere. The IRS hires a lot a people because they do<br />\nthe dirty work that most people don't want any part of.<br />\nI had a shot at an IRS position in New Brunswick, NJ,<br />\nbut I wasn't that desperate. You can get your PACE<br />\neligibility (originally good for a year) extended for an<br />\nindefinite period, so you really can't lose. The main<br />\nproblem is that the new Civil Service Act really cut<br />\ndown on Government hiring largesse. A hiring freeze<br />\ncan wipe you out for months. The problem with the<br />\nGovernment is getting in; once you're in, you're well on<br />\nyour way, particularly if you're willing to live in D.C.<br />\nBut you'll almost deinitely need a temporary job while<br />\nyou wait to hear from Uncle Sam.<br />\nA good resume is going to be a helpful supplement to the above-mentioned steps. This document<br />\nshould cover your job experience, education, and<br />\npersonal background, and generally portray you as<br />\nhighly desirable for employment. Hopefully, you could<br />\ndrop fifty of these in the mail (covered by a brief<br />\ninquiry) and have a chance of getting a nibble. Specific<br />\nresume forms can be found in library reference. Be sure<br />\nto use the largest type size you can when typing it up or<br />\nhaving it prepared for you.<br />\nHand in glove with the resume is the interviewing<br />\nprocess. The ability to well in an interview is somewhat<br />\ninstinctual. You have to establish a rapport with the<br />\ninterviewer, but it's more than personal chemistry,<br />\nbreath mints, and a neat haircut. Interviewers generally<br />\nfollow a pattern (remember, some of them do this eight<br />\nhours a day). Typical questions are: What would you<br />\nlike to be doing five years from now? (My answer: in a<br />\npolicy-making position); why do you think you'll be<br />\ngood in this job? (think fast); what is your greatest<br />\nstrength? (don't exaggerate excessively); what is your<br />\ngreatest weakness? (be sincere, but don't say anything<br /><br />\nstupid). And ask intelligent questions of your own,<br />\nwhich reflect an understanding of the work environment and (if possible) the particular company you are<br />\napplying to. Nervousness during interviews is something<br />\nyou must deal with on you own, but if you are prepared<br />\nfor tough questions, and can verbalize your employment<br />\nvalue, you should do well. The more interviews you<br />\nhave, the better you'll become at selling yourself convincingly.<br />\nThe assumption throughout all this discussion of<br />\njob-seeking is that you need a job as soon as possible<br />\nbecause you need to support yourself. Most graduates<br />\ncertainly don't know what they want to do with their<br />\nlives, beyond get rich, famous, and frequently laid.<br />\nObviously, if you know what you want, you have an<br />\nadvantage in the effort to achieve it. But, I assume that<br />\nyou don't know what you want, and that your immediate goal is to put a roof above you and food on the<br />\ntable. In this light, a general strategy is to start somewhere and move to a management position on the basis<br />\nof your unique strengths as they operate in the particular job situation. The theory is that humanities majors<br />\nfrom Hopkins make good management people once they<br />\nget a little experience; but don't expect to work from<br />\nclerk to executive V.P. in eight months. And make sure<br />\nyou can distinguish between serving your apprenticeship<br />\nand beating your head against a brick wall.<br />\nAny management experience you've had during<br />\nprevious employment or extracurricular activities will<br />\nsubstantiate your claim to a position in the leadership<br />\ncadre. (Watering plants in the SAC office doesn't carry<br />\nmuch weight in this context.) But even peon jobs teach<br />\nyou something about management, because if you've<br />\never been mismanaged when you were an Indian, you'll<br />\nremember it when you become a chief. Some prospective employers like their future management people to be<br />\ncollege boys who have sweated out a summer at Bethlehem Steel, just because the blend of certification and<br />\nblue collar labor is a good one.<br />\nIn the long run (which is really beyond the scope<br />\nof this article) the B.A. Generalist can have a career<br />\nwhich is both financially and emotionally rewarding,<br />\nas well as satisfying to whatever philosophical needs you<br />\nmight have. President Muller suggested, in an article<br />\nwhich appeared in Newsweek a couple of years ago, that<br />\nvolunteer service was the key to utilizing the surplus of<br />\ncollege grads. The only flaw with this altruism is, as I<br />\nfound out first hand, that many times the volunteer<br />\norganizations don't want you unless you have skills<br />\nwhich are worth a lot on the job market. I tried to get<br />\ninto the Peace Corps for a year, and found that even<br />\nthey don't have much demand for English majors.<br />\nJob-hunting is the main feature of the Season in<br />\nHell which constitutes Post-Graduate Depression. The<br />\nnew social circle friends at work, school girlfriend or<br />\nboyfriend you keep around, school friends you stick<br />\nevolves haphazardly around the identity crisis<br />\nwith<br />\nwhich is most closely tied to career at this point. Like<br />\npuberty, graduation is a step from one phase of existence to another, and you can comfort yourself with the<br />\nthought that the months of self-doubt and scrambling<br />\nwill give was to a new personna which is stronger,<br />\ntougher, tried in the fire of adversity, and worthy of its<br />\nfuture success. Until the day that personna arrives, you<br />\ncan spend your IPost-Graduate Depression purging<br />\nyourself of unprofitable vanity and other assorted<br />\nbullshit you picked up in your college years.<br /><br />\nPAGE 10 FEBRUARY 2.2, 1980<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\nGRAD<br />\nCLUB<br /><br />\nWANTS<br /><br />\nYOU!!<br /><br />\nTO BE A<br />\nGRAD CLUB BARTENDER<br />\nPOSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK<br />\nNORMAL SHIFTS ARE 5 - 9 pm,9 - 2 am JUST ONCE A WEEK<br /><br />\nd<br /><br />\nCONTACT NEIL NELAN, DEPT.

Therefore, it was a bit surprising to hear of the<br />\nannouncement of a new show at the<br />\nGallery entitled \"African Image: Representations of the Black Throughout<br />\nHistory\", a supposedly comprehensive<br />\nsurvey of the portrayal of the black from<br />\nas early as the 15th century B.C. in<br />\nEgypt, to the present. The Walters does<br />\nnot usually devote itself to exhibits of<br />\nsuch broad scope and contemporary<br />\nsignificance. As it turns out, the show is<br />\na general disappointment, doomed by the<br />\nabsence of a distinct perspective--social,<br />\nartistic or otherwise, and a carelessness of<br />\narrangement and design which detracts<br />\nfrom any spirit the exhibit may evoke.<br />\nThe problem here is not that the<br />\nIn fact,<br />\nworks of art lack quality.<br /><br />\nthere are quite a few remarkable pieces,<br />\nincluding a sculpture (about 650 B.C.)<br />\nof King Senkamanisken of the early<br />\nAfrican kingdom of Kush, and a number<br />\nof medieval manuscript illuminations<br />\ndepicting the visitation of the Three Magi,<br />\nthe youngest of which is the Ethiopian<br />\nKing Caspar. As beautiful as many of<br />\nthese works may be, they appear to have<br />\nbeen chosen mainly to remind the viewer<br />\nthat Africans have indeed been around<br />\nfor quite a while, and that their presence<br />\nwas known long before their incorporation into the Western society. However, a<br />\nroom full of versions of the Adoration of<br />\nthe Magi.(some of which include Caspar<br />\nas a sublimal, hardly visible figure) does<br />\nlittle to tell us how the black was regarded in the Middle ages. Naturally, one<br />\nwould be hard pressed to find works that<br />\nwould do this appropriately, since blacks<br />\nare extremely rare in early European art;<br />\nfor this reason, there should have been<br />\nless emphasis on the earlier sections of<br />\nthe show, and more on works of the<br />\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nGericault's Head ofa Negro (1823-4); Mount's The Bones Player (1856).<br /><br />\nThe nineteenth century section is<br />\nperhaps the most impressive of the<br />\nexhibit, largely because of the relative<br />\nwealth of black-related art during this<br />\nperiod. Of special note are two works by<br />\nGericault, \"The Boxers\" and \"Head<br />\nof a Negro\", both of which suggest the<br />\nartist's sensitivity to the black man.<br />\nCharles Cordier's \"Bust of a Sengalese<br />\nWoman\" is a strikingly realistic work, and<br />\nfurther exemplifies the growing concern<br />\nin the 19th century for the depiction of<br />\nAfrican beauty. There are a number of<br />\nimpressive American works, including<br />\nThomas Waterman Wood's \"Moses, the<br />\nBaltimore News Vendor,\"which come<br />\nthe closest to rendering the black man in<br />\nhis social environment. Unfortunately,<br />\nthis portion of the exhibit ends all too<br />\nabruptly, and procedes to the twentieth<br />\ncentury, which is perhaps the greatest<br />\ndisappointment of the show. It consists<br />\nsolely of a series of 1970's photographs<br />\nby Baltimore photographer John Clark<br />\nMayden. While these are fine and very<br />\nsensitive works, and would on their own<br />\nconstitute an impressive personal exhibit,<br />\nthey are not an adequate representation<br />\nof the depiction of the black in this<br />\ncentury.. There is one painting by<br />\nThomas Hart Benton, at the entrance to<br />\nthe gallery, but this hardly makes up for<br />\nsuch a serious omission. It is especially<br />\nsurprising that the century in which<br />\nblacks attained their greatest recognition<br />\nis the least documented in the exhibit.<br /><br />\ncomprehensive perspective of the black<br />\nfrom the beginning of history, the curators of the exhibit have gone too far and<br />\nyet not far enough. They have taken a<br />\nmassively<br />\nchallenging<br />\nchronological<br />\nscope, so expansive that the exhibit could<br />\nnot possibly provide a full representation,<br />\nwhile limiting the ideological scope to<br />\nlittle more than the rendering of the<br />\nphysical features of black men and<br />\nwomen. Ironically, a display that should<br />\nhave asserted black pride does no more<br />\nthan acknowledge the existence of the<br />\nrace, which does not seem to be enough.<br />\nUpon leaving the show, one is not left<br />\nwith any distinct indication of where the<br />\nblack has been or where he is going.<br />\nWhether or not this was the intention of<br />\nthe show is unclear, as there is a blatant<br />\nlack of printed commentary; almost all of<br />\nthe written material is restricted to the<br />\nindividual placards, which often fail to<br />\nplace the work of art in proper perspective.<br />\nThe idea of an exhibit bringing<br />\ntogether portrayals of the black in art is<br />\nunique and worthwhile, but it could<br />\n\u2022have been done tar better justice in a<br />\nmore narrowly defined form, in which<br />\nonly the last two, or perhaps three<br />\ncenturies were taken into perspective.

Not only is the film poorly and<br />\nhastily made, with mediocre dialogue<br />\nand less-than-mediocre acting, it also<br />\nreveals a pathetic truth about the quality<br />\nof marriage in America--that couples have<br />\nmore in common with the movie's<br />\nsuperficial characters than Hollywood<br />\nwould have us believe.<br />\nDespite its apocalyptic title, The<br />\nCouple in America has<br />\nMarried<br />\nLast<br />\nnothing to do with science fiction.<br /><br />\nf.',ega an<br /><br />\nRather, it takes place in modern day<br />\nCalifornia, the hotbed of \"police strikes,<br />\nwomen's lib, gay lib, and condominiums,\" about which the movie's married,<br />\nseparated, and divorced couples constantly moan. The opening scene is a touchfootball game in a luxuriant, suburban<br />\npark. At first, four or five middle-aged<br />\ncouples split into teams and bicker<br />\ngood-naturedly. But as the movie unfolds, the couples allow their bickering<br />\n(mostly about sexual jealously and<br />\nrepression) to turn into divorce. Two by<br />\ntwo they leave the game, just like ten<br />\nlittle Indians.<br />\nThe protagonists of this modern<br />\ndrama are Jeff(George Segal) and Maurie<br /><br />\noo : a toas. o mcnogamy... or monotony.<br /><br />\n(Natalie Wood). They are the heroes<br />\nbecause they remain married while all<br />\ntheir friends separate or get divorced.<br />\nThough Jeff and Maurie are just as<br />\nsuperficial as their swinging friends, they<br />\nmanage to encounter enough negative<br />\nrole models to convince themselves that<br />\nmarriage, while it may be boring, sexually<br />\nunstimulating, and definitely un-chic, is<br />\nbetter than the \"liberation\" of the<br />\nsingle world--a world of loneliness, casual<br />\nsex, and orgies with people outside your<br />\nclose circle of friends. Jeff and Maurie<br />\nsplit up because Maurie gets gonnorhea<br />\nfrom Jeff, who has been pressured into<br />\nscrewing a woman who won't take \"no\"<br />\nfor an answer, and each takes a young<br />\nlover to make the other jealous. They<br />\nreunite in a melodramatic bedroom scene<br />\nin which a swinging wife from San Diego<br />\nstrips and then suddenly realizes that she<br />\nhas had enough orgies and \"doesn't know<br />\nwhat love-making means any more.\"<br />\nIt is then that Jeff and Maurie decide that<br />\nmarried life wasn't so bad after all.<br />\nIt is unclear whether The Last<br />\nMarried Couple is supposed to be taken as<br />\na serious social statement, a farce, or<br />\nboth. All the characters are stereotypes<br />\n(e.g., the super-aggressive woman who has<br />\nhad her vagina tightened, the plumber<br />\nwho makes pornographic movies and is<br />\nmarried--for the fourth time\u2014to a prostitute), and eyery line of dialogue sounds<br />\nlike it comes from a bad soap opera.<br />\nMost of these lines are recited mechanically, and the long, heart-felt speeches<br />\nhave the ring of Playboy's party jokes.<br />\nGeorge Segal's amazingly plastic face\u2014<br />\nso. unassumingly beguiling in his other<br /><br />\nCoupe um es t ,e pass.<br />\nmovies--is here almost gruesome. Natalie<br />\nWood's ever shapely legs (which she<br />\nshows to advantage in several revealing<br />\nskirts) are the best part of her performance.<br />\nBut, if this movie falls flat as<br />\nfarce, (intentionally or not) it reveals<br />\nmuch as social commentary. Many of<br />\nthose in our parents' generation, raised<br />\nwith one set of values and exposed to<br />\nanother while raising their own chiPrep,<br />\nnow feel cheated out of the rewards of<br />\nboth worlds. To make up for lost time,<br />\nmany are now discarding spouses and<br />\nchildren in a vain search to \"find them- \u2022<br />\nselves\"\u2014a journey that often leads to<br />\nunhappiness. At its most effective, The<br />\nLast Married Couple reali.3&amp;aily porlravs<br />\nthese people, who often appear ridiculous<br />\n. The<br />\nin their bewildering corninertyr.<br />\ncharacters in the movie have<br />\nselves over into rigid \"new imavs\" in<br />\nwhich few are really happy. They are<br />\nobsessed with marriage, divorce, 2nd sex,<br />\nand discuss nothing else; they blindly<br />\nfollow the \"swinger\" lifestyle so clearly<br />\noutlined in trendy magazines; and they<br />\nare swept up in the contagious fad of<br />\ndivorce.

The<br />\nBlue Jays had a difficult time<br />\n'getting their offense going and<br />\nwere unable to defend successfully against the opposition's<br />\nquick passes and inside shots.<br />\nThe loss brought the team's<br />\nrecord to 4-11.<br />\nThe most exciting game of<br />\nthe season was played last<br />\nMonday night against Coppin<br />\n+State. After falling behind by<br />\nsix points the Jays rallied back<br />\nto take the lead. The team was<br />\nup by as many as 16 points<br />\nduring the first half but watched<br />\nCoppin fight back and tie the<br />\ngame with just over one minute<br />\nto play. With a tenacious full<br />\ncourt press, the Jays held on and<br />\nthe game went into overtime. In<br />\nthis final period Sue Tyler came<br />\nthrough with 6 of her game-high<br />\n22 points to lead the team to a<br />\nCarol Hahn,<br />\n63<br />\n,-61 victory.<br />\nGiteryl Baron and Bonnie Garner<br />\nwere all in double figures.

Strong rebounding and tough defense by Cheryl<br />\n\"Boom Boom\" Baron and<br />\nMartha Heyman gave the team a<br />\nsecond and third shot at the<br />\nhoop. At center, Bonnie Garner<br />\nand Caitlin Griffith added height<br />\nand a smooth inside shot that<br />\npleased the fans. At guard,<br />\nKathleen King amazed everyone<br />\nwith her outside \"bombs\" that<br />\nswished through the hoop.<br />\nFreshman guard Kim Stevens<br />\nsurprised the opposition with<br />\nher numerous steals and a<br />\nconsistent shot.<br />\nCoach Donna Seegar and<br />\nassistant Bill Richardson were<br />\npleased with the attitude of the<br />\nteam. Coach Seegar praised the<br />\nflexibility of the team members<br />\nin being able to shift positions in<br />\nthe middle of the season as well<br />\nas in the middle of a game. She<br />\nfeels that the team could have<br />\nwon more of the contests but<br />\nacknowledges that this year<br />\nhas been a building year for the<br />\nteam.

Averaging twenty-five turnovers a game, Hopkins was<br />\nout-rebounded by every opponent and shot poorly from the<br />\nfield and the foul line, 45.3%<br />\nand 63.6%, respectively.<br />\nHopkins' bad luck and<br />\ninconsistent play, a problem<br />\nduring the entire season, continued as the Blue Jays lost all<br />\neight of their last contests.<br />\nIn their final game of the season,<br />\nHopkins succumbed to Washington College in double overtime,<br />\n79-71. The Jays played with<br />\ngreat intensity and certainly did<br />\nnot look like a 3-19 team. Tom<br />\nTessitore led the team in scoring<br />\nwith 21 points, the majority of<br />\nthem coming from the foul line,<br />\nwhere he shot 11 for 13. Scott<br />\nBarr chipped in with 14 points.<br />\nA similar outcome marked<br />\nthe game against Haverford. In a<br />\nclose, but not well played game,<br />\nHopkins lost 63-59. The Jays<br />\nstayed close throughout the<br />\ngame, as thcy tried to avenge a<br />\nprevious 76-72 loss to Haverford.<br />\nIn their two games prior to<br />\nthe Haverford contest, Hopkins<br />\nwas soundly defeated by both<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, 85-53,<br />\nand Widener, 65-48. Against<br />\nWidener, Hopkins shot poorly<br />\nform the start, falling behind<br />\n30-9.

However, the Jays never got any<br />\ncloser, as Widener employed a<br />\nstall, slowing the game down.<br />\nCoach Jim Amen summed<br />\nup the season as a large disappointment. He pointed out the<br />\nteam had several tough losses:<br />\none point losses to the Merchant<br />\nMarine and York, two four point<br />\nlosses to Haverford, a two point<br />\nloss to Ursinus and a doubleovertime defeat at the hands of<br />\nWashington. Nevertheless, after<br />\nenjoying only seven of forty-five<br />\ngames in the past two years, the<br />\nteam needs a great deal of help.<br />\nCoach Amen feels the team<br />\nneeds a rebounder (to take the<br />\nheat off Tom Tessitore and Dan<br />\nJackson, who are shooting forwards), a man who can put the<br />\nball in the basket at least 50% of<br /><br />\nthe time, and someone who can<br />\nrun the offense and penetrate<br />\ninside. He feels the team has<br />\nsuffered from the lack of a guard<br />\nwho can shoot from the outside,<br />\na deficiency which has permitted<br />\nopposition defenses to sag inside, making it difficult for<br />\nHopkins to move the ball inside.<br />\nOnce again, the team was<br />\nled in scoring by Dan Jackson,<br />\nwho finished with a 14.8 point<br />\naverage. Jackson, who at one.<br />\npoint was averaging almost f7<br />\npoints per contest, found it<br />\nharder to score during the<br />\nsecond half of the season.<br />\nJackson also led the team in<br />\nrebounding and blocked shots.<br />\nScott Kautz, who became the<br />\nplaymaker during the second<br />\nhalf of the season, led the team<br />\nin steals and assists, but failed to<br />\npenetrate and score.<br /><br />\nFencers Prepare For<br />\n80 MAC Title Bout<br />\nThe Hopkins fencing team<br />\nhas reversed its recent string of<br />\ndefeats during the past two<br />\nweeks with a trio of wins over a<br />\nvariety of opponents. After an<br />\nembarassing 17-10 loss'to Haverford, the Jays managed three<br />\ncome-from behind victories<br />\nagainst U.M.B.C., Seton Hall,<br />\nand Rutgers-Newark. With one<br />\ndual meet left in their 1979-80<br />\ncampaign, the fencers are now<br />\n14-6.<br />\nTwo weeks ago, Hopkins<br />\nstarted badly by losing to<br />\nHaverford. In that meet, everybody on the Blue Jay squad<br />\nseemed'to fence below ability.<br />\nAgainst U.M.B.C., the fencers<br />\nto have trouble<br />\nseemed<br />\ngetting started, but found the<br />\nright combinnation in time to<br />\npick up a narrow 14-13 victory.<br />\nThe next week, Hopkins<br />\nsurvived two tough meets against<br />\nRutgers and Seton Hall. Julian<br />\nMcCarthy of Seton Hall remarked how much they had been<br />\npreparing for the meet with<br />\nHopkins<br />\nThZir preparation<br />\nshowed, as Hopkins fell behind<br />\nboth teams 11-10, before winn-<br /><br />\ning both meets 15-12. The<br />\nmeets were run simultaneously<br />\nand the final outcome of both<br />\ncontests was in doubt until the<br />\nvery end.<br />\nCoach Oles, discussing last<br />\nweek's performance, stated that<br />\n\"For the first time in two weeks,<br />\nwe fenced up to par. We ended<br />\na crisis of confidence and did all<br />\nthis without our number two<br />\nsabreman.\" He was referring to<br />\nAlan Benheim, who has been out<br />\nfor the past 3 weeks. Oles also<br />\nnoted that in the last rounds of<br />\nthe Seton Hall and Rutgers<br />\nmeets,\"we cleaned up, going 6-3<br />\nand 7-2\".<br />\nThe Jays are now looking<br />\nforward to the Middle Atlantic<br />\nChampionship meet to be held<br />\nSunday at George Mason. A lot<br />\nis riding on this year's championship. Hopkins is the defending champion, as well as the<br />\noverall champion.
