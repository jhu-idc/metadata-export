The government felt that there was no problem, he said. Only after a tragic<br />\nfire were there results for the<br />\n\"hidden homeless,\"he said.<br />\nChong said that there is also a<br />\n\"destructive aspect\" to the<br />\n\"stigma of model minority.\"<br />\nPerceptions that \"Asians are better. . .creates tremendous resentment,\" according to Chong. The<br />\nsubliminal message being sent out<br />\nby the media, said Chong, is<br />\n\"why can't other minorities be<br />\nlike Asians?\"<br />\nChong also argued that the<br />\ndecline of the United States has<br />\nled to resentment, especially<br />\ntowards Japan. He cited a Time<br />\npoll which showed an eight percent increase in American resentment towards the Japanese from<br />\n1987 to 1990, while resentment<br />\nSoviets declined<br />\ntoward<br />\nmarkedly.<br />\nChong noted that the sale of<br />\nUniversal/MCA to Japan prompted a New York Newsday<br />\nheadline which questioned the<br />\nsale of movie companies to<br />\nforeign investors, while the sale<br />\nof MGM/UA to an Italian group<br />\ngot \"nowhere near the media attention.\"<br />\nDespite the media's negative<br />\nportrayal of foreign investment,<br />\n<br />\naccording to Chong, an MIT<br />\nstudy showed that the effects of<br />\nsuch investments are positive.<br />\n\"The US is facing a capital shortage,\" Chong said. \"They<br />\nwouldn't be here if there were<br />\nnecessary capital.\"<br />\nChong pointed to certain problems in US society which need to<br />\nbe addressed to explain the increased number of racial incidents against Asians. Specifically, he said that the United States<br />\nmust retool basic industries and<br />\nreinvest in education and<br />\ncommunities.<br />\nAccording to Chong, incidents<br />\nlike the Flatbush boycott of a<br />\nKorean merchant are symbolic of<br />\n\"two disenfranchised groups pitted against one another.\" He also<br />\nsaid that the \"media missed the<br />\nboat on the issue\" by superficially calling it a racist boycott.<br />\nWhile he agreed that blacks are<br />\ncapable of racism, Chong said<br />\nthat the real enemies are banks<br />\nwhich wield institutional racism.<br />\nHe suggested that banks' unwillingness to make loans to poor<br />\ncommunities amounts to racism.<br />\nCommunity leaders need to<br />\nbuild effective coalitions, according to Chong. He warned that it<br />\nis more difficult today, in a<br />\n\"climate of survivalism.\" Chong<br />\nalso said that it is important to get<br />\nresources channelled into communities and to \"go after the real<br />\nenemy: banks which are failing<br />\nto provide capital.\"<br />\n<br />\nBainerman Discusses Viability<br />\nOf Separate Palestinian State<br />\nby Bill Van Horne<br />\nJoel Bainerman discussed the<br />\neconomic and political dimensions of a separate Palestinian<br />\nstate in a lecture entitled \"What<br />\nWould Happen If.. .The Viability of a Palestinian State,\" on<br />\nWednesday, November 28.

Mr.<br />\nBainerman is currently a foreign<br />\ncorrespondent and economic<br />\neditor of the Jewish Post.<br />\nBecause the impending war in<br />\nthe Persian Gulf dominates the<br />\nnews today, Bainerman began by<br />\ndiscussing America's role in the<br />\ncurrent crisis. \"When I came<br />\nover to the United States, I<br />\nunderstood that Americans don't<br />\n<br />\nunderstand why they are in the<br />\nPersian Gulf,\" Bainerman said,<br />\nreferring to the 400,000 United<br />\nStates troops that will be in place<br />\nby the end of this January.<br />\n\"There is an extreme degree of<br />\nover-confidence in the U.S. The<br />\nIraqis have no problems with having heavy casualties in a war.\"<br />\nBainerman said, \"But once the<br />\nfirst 15 American soldiers come<br />\nback in body bags, it will be very<br />\ndifficult for the U.S. to continue<br />\nthe war.\"<br />\nBainerman also discussed the<br />\nconsequences of a war in the Persian Gulf. \"What happens if the<br />\nU.S. wins the war?\" Bainerman<br />\nasked. \"There will be a continued<br />\noccupation and military presence<br />\nin Saudi Arabia by the United<br />\n<br />\nThis Week<br />\n\"Direct it and they will<br />\ncome.\" A review of Kevin<br />\nCostner's directorial<br />\ndebut, Dances with<br />\nWolves, is in Arts, p. 6.<br />\nWho's Number One for<br />\nChicago-style pizza?

According to several modern theorists,<br />\nhe said, the Torah is made up of<br />\n<br />\na number of different documents<br />\nwritten by various people and<br />\npulled together over a period of<br />\ntime.<br />\nIn his attempt to discover<br />\nwhich of these theories comes<br />\nclosest to the truth, Goldfinger<br />\nused \"Torah Codes\" as<br />\nevidence. \"Torah Codes,\"<br />\nGoldfinger said, are ways in<br />\nwhich the author of the Torah<br />\ncommunicates messages and<br />\nideas to those who study it.<br />\nHe referred to two aspects of<br />\nthe Torah to establish the<br />\nlegitimacy of these codes. First,<br />\nhe said, the Torah is the communication by God to man: a<br />\nrevelation. It follows, Goldfinger<br />\nargued, that each letter of the<br />\nTorah is precious and must be<br />\nintact.<br />\nSecond, it is the plan of creation, he said. The Torah was<br />\ncreated before the world and the<br />\nworld was created only so the<br />\nTorah could be put into effect.<br />\n<br />\nGoldfinger gave an example of<br />\nparents being created in order to<br />\nbe honored. Therefore, deduced<br />\nGoldfinger, everything in the<br />\nworld must be found in the<br />\nTorah.<br />\nHaving set down the basic<br />\nfoundations for his arguments,<br />\nGoldfinger began his story. In<br />\n1917, he said, the Chairman of<br />\nthe Department of Mathematics<br />\nat Harvard University attempted<br />\nto prove divine origination of the<br />\nBible by looking at the only<br />\noriginal portion, the Hebrew text<br />\nof the Old Testament.<br />\nHe studied the text, Goldfinger<br />\nsaid, and found several complicated number patterns which<br />\nwould have been too complex to<br />\nhave been contrived by a human.<br />\nHe challenged several colleagues<br />\nto create a similar number pattern<br />\nand they were unable to do so.<br />\nCould this pattern have been accidental?

With<br />\nmoney and student commitment in perennial short supply, it can<br />\nbecome a herculean task just to produce an average issue of the NewsLetter, Zeniada, or The Spectator, to name only three. Administrators<br />\naren't much help; students often have to scramble for initial funding,<br />\nthen claw their way through budget hearings each year. Though campus publications, we are so often told, are \"useful\" and \"beneficial<br />\nto the community,\" they nonetheless remain the same as any other<br />\ncampus group\u2014no special treatment is the rule.<br />\nThe semi-annual Course Guide should be an exception to such<br />\nsystematic indifference; there is no campus publication with as much<br />\npotential to monitor and, where necessary, improve the quality of<br />\neducation at Hopkins. The Guide comprises student evaluations of<br />\ncourses and instructors, which are tabulated from the responses of<br />\nthe students in a given class. It grandiosely\u2014and appropriately\u2014<br />\nblesses or damns the instructors with a numerical rating and pegs<br />\nthe course with a letter grade. It's an increasingly important function within an institution where the non-English-speaking T.A., swelling seminar class, and somnolent professor have become distressingly commonplace. The Guide 's function, as we understand it, is<br />\nto help warn students away from such disasters\u2014and to alert them<br />\nto whatever gems the Listing of Courses may be hiding.<br />\nIn practice, however, the Guide is rather impoverished. It prints<br />\nlistings not merely of the courses offered in the coming semester,<br />\nbut of any course from the previous spring that received sufficient<br />\ndata. This makes for a puzzling read at times; each issue contains<br />\n\"reviews\" of courses that may not be offered this year\u2014or possibly<br />\never again. It would be far simpler to list courses for the coming<br />\nsemester in one section, and the non-repeating courses in another.<br />\nMore important are the results themselves, which range from comprehensive to mystifying to useless. One typical entry in the current<br />\nissue praises a Sociology class for its able and helpful T.A.s, but<br />\ngives none of their names. Numerous other listings cite the student<br />\nsample without a second number\u2014\"38/?\" to take one example. How<br />\ncan a reader gauge the accuracy of the data without knowing what<br />\npercentage they represent? Surely the Guide staff had access to such<br />\nuncontroversial figures. An astonishing number of courses are omitted<br />\nentirely from the Guide: every single offering by the Departments<br />\nof English and History and substantial numbers of those in<br />\nHumanities, Civil Engineering, Mathematics, and beyond.<br />\nClearly, improvement is needed if the Course Guide is to fulfill<br />\nits mission. The first step toward that goal would be to ensure that<br />\nit has the kind of staff it needs to do a complicated and maddening<br />\ntask. This is where the administration could step in, either by a) offering personnel to help in obtaining and compiling the data or b)<br />\nestablishing a payroll account substantial enough to maintain a decent work force at semester's end, when even the most selfless of<br />\nvolunteers disappear to save their GPAs.<br />\nEqually important, the administration should install a mechanism\u2014<br />\npreferably through the deans of Arts and Sciences and Engineering\u2014to<br />\nensure that professors and T.A.s pass out course evaluation forms<br />\n<br />\nand get them to the Guide quickly and without interference. If the<br />\ndeans and instructors protest that they don't have time, as likely they<br />\nwill, then the Guide staff should make regular reports to President<br />\nRichardson about the quality of various academic departments; that's<br />\nin effect what its job is, anyway. The Guide isn't a Sharper Image<br />\ncatalog manufactured for aimless student-consumers; it is there to<br />\nevaluate the faculty and courses of this University\u2014something which<br />\nany instructor or dean should take seriously.<br />\nBut the Course Guide has to earn that respect. Even without any<br />\nhelp from the administration, there are several changes it could enact<br />\nto make the whole process easier and more informative for all<br />\nconcerned:<br />\nFirst, redesign the evaluation forms. Most people are so frazzled<br />\nat semester's end that they struggle with filling out a deposit slip,<br />\nmuch less the convoluted, redundant queries on the student response<br />\nforms. Leave out questions about what was required for the course\u2014<br />\nask that on a separate instructor's form\u2014and concentrate on getting<br />\nopinions about the lectures and sections. More quotes from students<br />\nwould enliven the Guide tremendously; make sure there is ample opportunity to give them. In addition, find out what kind of readings<br />\nand papers a course requires. One instructor may expect 200 pages<br />\nof literary theory reading each week, with written summaries; another<br />\nmay assign 200 pages of Ecosystems and You, replete with cartoons<br />\nof evolving tadpoles. Recognize the difference, and weigh them<br />\naccordingly.<br />\nTake special care when reviewing courses such as language<br />\nElements, or Molecular Cell Biology, or International Monetary<br />\nEconomics. Required courses that attract such large numbers deserve<br />\na more explicit treatment than a seminar might, if only because they<br />\nloom so large in Hopkins legend. Find out who the most painless<br />\nTAs are, as well as the best ones, and give them recognition. Suggest tips for coping with the gargantuan class sizes, when applicable,<br />\nand what to do about navigating the reserve room. Most important<br />\nof all, render course descriptions in more interesting prose. Many<br />\nof the current entries are roughly as vivid as the average telegraph<br />\nmessage; it doesn't have to be that way. Faculty and students, for<br />\ntheir part, can help chiefly by cooperating with the Guide as much<br />\nas possible. Instructors should make certain they they distribute and<br />\ncollect the forms; students, similarly, should fill them out<br />\nthoughtfully\u2014it only takes about three minutes, and the benefits to<br />\nothers can be immense. Any student with a little extra time should<br />\nvolunteer it to the Guide to help with copy editing, assembling data,<br />\nor\u2014ideally\u2014restructuring the whole operation.<br />\nIt is always awkward when one campus publication puts another<br />\nunder the magnifying glass; often it is just an excuse to express condescension, sibling rivalry, or pointless malice. But the News-Letter<br />\nsees incalculable potential in the Course Guide, both as it is and how<br />\nit might be. With a few modifications and some consistent support<br />\nfrom the Hopkins community, it could eventually become the \"better mousetrap\" that Hopkins so badly needs.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br />\n<br />\nEpisode Ten: Tis the Season<br />\nMiranda slept on the train ride<br />\nhome from Thanksgiving at<br />\nCarol's. The girl sitting next to<br />\nher had her Walkman blaring<br />\nChristmas carols, and Miranda<br />\nwinced, remembering the onset<br />\nof the holiday season.<br />\nThe radio was worthless.<br />\nUsually Miranda listened to one<br />\nof those east coast progressive<br />\nrock stations; it gave her the opportunity to listen to all those<br />\nsongs that she liked so much in<br />\nLos Angeles three years ago.<br />\nBut come November 16, there<br />\nwas nowhere to turn. The moment Miranda had been dreading<br />\nhad arrived.<br />\nIts arrival was announced by<br />\nBig Dave Wild, after playing<br />\ntwelve big rock wild hits<br />\ncommercial-free. There was a<br />\nbrief moment of station identification, and then out of<br />\nnowhere came the opening chords<br />\nof \"Feliz Navidad.\"<br />\nMiranda froze for a moment<br />\nwith horror, her eyes widened<br />\nnoticeably, and she slowly<br />\nturned to face the portable stereo<br />\nunit that was assaulting her. Her<br />\nhand shot out with the speed of<br />\na snake in a box, desperate to end<br />\nthe offending music.<br />\nBut nothing she could do now<br />\ncould halt the core of the problem<br />\nthat faced her. One way or<br />\nanother, she would have to face<br />\nthe truth: holiday season was<br />\nhere.<br />\nThat evening, she headed off to<br />\npractice with the dance company,<br />\nher sole extracurricular activity.<br />\nBy that point, she had pushed the<br />\nmemory of the slowly encroaching season to the back of<br />\nher mind. It wasn't that Miranda<br />\ndidn't like the holiday season, just<br />\nthat she wished that it didn't start<br />\nuntil she was home to enjoy it.<br />\nThe Christmas season always<br />\nreminded her of David, more so<br />\nthan other seasons, because it was<br />\nthe day before Christmas that he<br />\nhad asked her out.<br />\nShe was crossing the street to<br />\n<br />\nget to campus when the second<br />\nomen made itself known to her.<br />\nUp on a telephone pole, a city<br />\nworker was busy affixing a red<br />\ntinsel Christmas tree. As Miranda looked, she saw that the entire street was lined with tinsel<br />\n<br />\nIt wasn't that Miranda<br />\ndidn't like the holiday<br />\nseason, she just wished<br />\nthat it didn't start<br />\nuntil she was home<br />\ntrees, red and white and silver.<br />\nIn this day and age, she knew<br />\nenough not to wonder about<br />\ngreen.<br />\nThankfully, dance rehearsal<br />\nwent without difficulty (difficulty as Miranda defined it had to do<br />\nwith any contact with trees,<br />\nChristmas carols, snow, AT&T<br />\n\"reach out\" commercials, and of<br />\ncourse, \"Feliz Navidad\"). They<br />\npracticed a few Laurie Anderson<br />\nroutines (half the reason Miranda liked dance), warmed up,<br />\nwarmed down, and got to wear<br />\nleotards. If there were ever a type<br />\nof clothing that could gainsay the<br />\nholiday season, it was leotards.<br />\nOn the way back to her apartment, Miranda noticed that the<br />\nworker was gone. The street was<br />\ncompletely buried in tinsel, and<br />\nnow little colored lights had been<br />\nturned on. Still no green.<br />\nCarol was watching some<br />\ntelevision, and Doris was cooking. Good: nothing was out of the<br />\nordinary. If her roommates could<br />\nonly make it to Thanksgiving<br />\nwithout bringing up holiday<br />\ncheer, Miranda wouldn't have to<br />\nkill them.<br />\nShe slumped down on the<br />\ncouch next to Carol.<br />\n\"You comiong with me for<br />\nThanksgiving?\" Carol asked.<br />\n\"Sure,\" Miranda said.<br />\n\"Cool.

I wish to report the<br />\nBoard's insult to common sense and<br />\nits abuse of the English language in<br />\ncategorizing the offense as \"sexual<br />\nharassment.\"<br />\nThe Board's reasoning is difficult<br />\nto fathom from your report, but I'll<br />\ntry to reconstruct it. We may assume<br />\nthat the offending phrase, \"Suck my<br />\ndick,\" if uttered to a male member<br />\nof the community would no longer<br />\nconstitute sexual harassment but<br />\nwould be censured as a deplorable<br />\nvulgarity. Alternatively, if an<br />\nequivalent formula like \"Kiss my<br />\nass\" had been addressed to an<br />\nargumentative female, this would<br />\npresumably no longer constitute<br />\nsexual harrassment, but rather the<br />\npersonal affront that it is. Since it<br />\nseems precisely this insult as<br />\ndelivered to a female that gives<br />\ngrounds for supposing it a sexual offense, are we to understand that it is<br />\nsome form of invitation or even<br />\ncoercion to a sexual encounter? The<br />\ncircumstances of the affair hardly<br />\nseem propitious. This phrase, in<br />\nthese circumstances, is an<br />\nungentlemanly outburst that requires<br />\na personal\u2014that is, person to<br />\nperson\u2014apology. This was<br />\ndelivered and should have closed the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nI go on at some length with this absurdity because it suggests deeper<br />\ncauses for concern. If the concept of<br />\n\"sexual harassment\" is to be extended to comparable displays of bad<br />\nmanners, we shall suffer other<br />\njudicial errors in which the punishment patently fails to fit the crime.<br />\nMore serious in the long run will be<br />\nthe loss of the concept of civility<br />\ngoverning non-legal and non-ethical<br />\nrelations between persons. It would<br />\nbe an ironic consequence of feminist<br />\nconsciousness raising, which promotes the use of the neutral term,<br />\n\"person,\" if it encouraged our losing the idea of a person\u2014while its<br />\nefforts to protect women from genuine sexual abuse were being<br />\ntrivialized. When insulting language<br />\nis considered not a personal but a<br />\nsexual offense, we are suffering<br />\nfrom a loss of civility.<br />\nAvrom Fleishman<br />\nProfessor of English<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing to voice my outrage<br />\nat the unfair way smokers are being<br />\ntreated by the Residential Life Committee, and for that matter, the<br />\nResidential Life Office. Approximately two days before Thanksgiving Break, residents were informed<br />\nof a change in the smoking policy<br />\nthrough a well-hidden column entry<br />\nin the pseudo-publication \"Residential Rap.\" Then, on November 25,<br />\na sign appeared in the AMR 11 mail<br />\nroom stating that \"A survey was<br />\ndone by your res. life rep revealing<br />\nan overwhelming desire to prohibit<br />\nsmoking on 'on campus' and `off<br />\ncampus' housing. As a result RAB<br />\nwould like to inform you that NO<br />\nSMOKING is allowed on<br />\nHALLWAYS, STAIRWELLS, or<br />\nBATHROOMS after 11-24-90.\"<br />\nNow I realize that smoking has<br />\nbeen banned in governmental and<br />\nsome local public areas, and these<br />\nlaws have been upheld in the courts.<br />\nHowever, the RAB has overlooked<br />\none important element: The areas<br />\nwhere smoking is banned are not<br />\nwhere people live. We live here, and<br />\npaid thousands of hard earned<br />\ndollars to do so. Because of this, we<br />\nshould have all of the comforts of<br />\nhome, or at least the comforts of a<br />\ncomparable apartment complex. To<br />\ndeny us the right to smoke as we<br />\nenter or leave the building, or when<br />\nwe use the rest rooms, makes us feel<br />\nas though we don't live here and are<br />\nnot welcome. We would not pay<br />\nthousands of dollars to feel<br />\nunwelcome.<br />\nAnother problem with the new<br />\nrule is that smokers must leave the<br />\nonly common areas we have if we<br />\nwant to smoke. Because there are no<br />\nlounges here, the hallways are the<br />\ncommon areas, and now smokers are<br />\nnot welcome there.<br />\nAs for the \"survey\" that Res. Life<br />\n<br />\nclaims to have taken, no member of<br />\nBuilding A, or Gildersleeve, Griffin,<br />\nor Jennings houses have told me that<br />\nthey even received a survey. Where<br />\nexactly is this \"overwhelming\" demand coming from? Not from the<br />\npeople who live in housing,<br />\napparently.<br />\nI must also question the action that<br />\nthe RAB took.

Very few reasons for<br />\nthis new requirement have come to<br />\n<br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

Letters<br />\ncredited only to organizations<br />\nwill not be printed. Due to<br />\nthe volume of letters received, not all can be printed. We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br />\n<br />\nlight, and even fewer goirci reasons<br />\nhave appeared. Plenty of problemshave, however.<br />\nOne of the biggest problems to the<br />\nstudents affected by this plan is the<br />\nhuge increase in the cost of living for<br />\nstudents during sophomore year. According to Bettye Miller, university<br />\nhousing will be \"competitively priced\" with private housing. As any<br />\nHopkins student who has ever priced local housing knows, she is either<br />\nbadly misinformed, or lying through<br />\nher teeth. Sure, it is possible to spend<br />\nmore on housing and food in the<br />\nprivate sector while a student here,<br />\nbut it is also a hell of a lot easier to<br />\nspend a good deal less. According<br />\nto Dean Boswell, the cost for<br />\nsophomore housing will be comparable to living in the dorms, and<br />\nthis probably means the cost for<br />\nbuildings A or B rather than the<br />\nAMRs, since the accommodations<br />\nwill be similar. As past residents of<br />\nthese dorms know, these dorms are<br />\na fair amount more expensive than<br />\nprivate housing, and much the worse<br />\nin living conditions. Since it is admitted that the kitchenettes in these<br />\nnew dorms will not be very useful<br />\nfor cooking, the purchase of a meal<br />\nplan will be required. The number<br />\nof upperclassmen on the present<br />\nmeal plan should indicate something<br />\nof its popularity, value and quality.<br />\nWe are assured, however, that the<br />\nnew \"food court\" concept will be<br />\nmuch better. Yeah, right. Multiple<br />\noutlets dispensing bad food still<br />\nequals bad food.(One related question: Will all of these outlets be run<br />\nby Seiler's, as the Terrace Room,<br />\nSnack Bar, and Levering are now,<br />\nor have our administrators finally<br />\nlearned about the principles of competition in a market?)<br />\nIn addition to the increased cost<br />\nthat will be incurred by required<br />\nuniversity housing, students must<br />\nalso deal with a loss of a great deal<br />\nof privacy and independence. A<br />\nlarge majority of, if not all, of the<br />\nrooms will be doubles, with two<br />\ndoubles sharing a bathroom. In case<br />\nthe Hopkins administration has not<br />\nrealized it yet, most people like having some space to themselves, frequently in the form of a bathroom.<br />\nMost students that share bedrooms<br />\nin apartments and houses now do it<br />\nto save money and get a better, not<br />\nworse deal on housing. Also, after<br />\nfreshman year, many students are<br />\ntired of dealing with housemasters.<br />\nWill these new housemaster/CA's<br />\nconduct room checks for illicit popcorn poppers and microwaves?

This<br />\nsignals some effort on the part of<br />\nthe editors,just not enough. How<br />\nuseful is this publication?<br />\nLaborious examinations of the<br />\nlistings reveal that of the 358<br />\nundergraduate courses offered<br />\nlast spring (excluding research<br />\nand independent study), 122 are<br />\nreviewed in the Fall 1990 Course<br />\nGuide. That's about 34 percent.<br />\nSo right off the bat, 66 percent<br />\nof all the courses offered last<br />\nspring are not mentioned.<br />\nIn theory, the guide should<br />\ncover what will be offered in the<br />\nupcoming semester. But only 87<br />\nof the 122 courses reviewed are<br />\nscheduled for next semester, so<br />\n29 percent of what was reviewed is not immediately relevant. More telling is what is absent. Of the approximately 350<br />\ncourses offered next semester, the<br />\nGuide contains reviews of 87.<br />\nThat's only 24 percent coverage,<br />\nwhich leaves a great void of information.

Quite<br />\nsimply, many students look forward<br />\nto moving out of the dorms and away<br />\nfrom these petty harassments.<br />\nIn the end, it all comes down to<br />\na very simple question: Why do the<br />\nHopkins administrators feel that it is<br />\nnecessary to cram this \"feeling of<br />\ncommunity\" down our throats? if<br />\nsome students wish to live in these<br />\nnew university housing units, as undoubtedly many will, then great.<br />\nMore power to them.

The<br />\nStation, through that Wednesday<br />\nmorning, maintained that our event<br />\nwould still go on despite the financial woes that they have been experiencing. Some miscommunication between the individuals in the<br />\nStation's management and the new<br />\nowners led to their momentary lapse<br />\nof professionalism and as a result the<br />\nSenior Class was informed the very<br />\nafternoon that our event was to take<br />\nplace.<br />\nUpon learning this, the Senior<br />\nClass acted by informing as many<br />\npeople as possible. The escort van<br />\nservice was informed not to take<br />\npeople to the Station, the IFC was<br />\nasked to announce the news at their<br />\nmeeting, posters were put up at the<br />\nHoops games, MSE, Hut, the Station's doors, and all those who were<br />\nremembered as having intentions of<br />\nattending the event were notified by<br />\nphone calls throughout the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe student body can expect a<br />\nhigh degree of professionalism from<br />\nthe Senior Class leadership.

Also missing (that is,<br />\nomitted entirely) are Anthropology, Chemistry (where<br />\nare the Gryder and Principe supporters?), Chinese, and Korean.<br />\nOf course, if the Course Guide<br />\nis not comprehensive, it serves no<br />\npurpose. Why does it have these<br />\nproblems? The answer is that the<br />\nwhole operation is poorly run,<br />\nand has been for years. That,<br />\ncompounded by the apathetic attitude displayed by the students<br />\ntoward filling out forms, and the<br />\nparanoia of some of the professors, make it a crippled if not<br />\nmoribund repository of information.

The main attraction running Friday<br />\nthrough Sunday is a great example of French poetic<br />\nrealism by director Marcel Came and surrealist poet<br />\nand scriptwriter Jacques Prevert. Their famous<br />\nromantic epic Children of Paradise (1943-45; 7:00<br />\nand 10:15 p.m. Call for matinee times), using the<br />\nstory of an affair between a woman and a pantomimist, explores the themes of the relationship between life and art, and realisty and theater. Since this<br />\nmasterpiece is just over three hours, the other feature<br />\nis a collection of short subjects by Emile Cole. From<br />\nDec 3-6, the Orpheum presents La Nuit De Varennes(1982, dir. Ettore Scola; 7:15), a comedy of ideas<br />\nbringing together Marcell\u00b0 Mastroianni, Harvey<br />\nKeitel and others as Thomas Paine, Casanova on the<br />\neve of the French Revolution. At 10:00 p.m. is Danton (1982, dir. Andrew Wajda), starring Gerard<br />\nDepardieu in another spectacular performance, this<br />\ntime set during the Reigh of Terror following the<br />\nFrench Revolution.<br />\nOn campus: Continuing the military theme in these<br />\njingoistic times, Weekend Wonderflix is going<br />\nhighbrow this week, with a screening of The Cook,<br />\nthe Thief, His Wife and Her Lover(1990, dir. Peter<br />\nGreenaway; Fri and Sat at 8 & 10:15 in Shriver<br />\nHall). Greenaway, whose films are always controversial, whether involving the detachment in the quest<br />\nfor knowledge or the taboo of cannibalism, is a<br />\nmaster allusioninst. CTWL draws on Jacobean<br />\nrevenge plays, Swift, Rabelais, and paintings to<br />\ncreate his tableaux. The result is stunning, accompanied by another Michael Nyman score. Going for<br />\nthe lowbrow crowd is the Senior Class Film Series,<br />\nwhich presents Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, John<br />\nDeBello's 1980 attempt at comedy. The title alone<br />\nis worthy of some sort of prize, but the content<br />\ndoesn't measure up. Women in Prison (Sunday at<br />\n7 & 9 in Shriver), the Reel World offering on Sunday, is probably not as bad as it sounds. This one<br />\npromises humiliation, dehumanization and bonding,<br />\nif not bondage. Admission to each of the above is<br />\n$2 for students, $3 general.<br />\nTonight only at 8 p.m. Maryland Institute/College<br />\nof Art (1300 W. Mt.

Corral.<br />\nBeautifully photographed, with great attention to<br />\ndetail. Saturday night the Film Forum presents The<br />\nLast Laugh, a video documentary about nine men<br />\nwith AIDS, narrated by Sally Kellerman.<br />\nOn Thursday Dec 6 the Showcase turns its spotlight<br />\non Renoir's La Bete Humaine(The Human Beast).<br />\nRenoir condemns the social system and confused ignorance of its victims in his update of Emile Zola's<br />\nnovel about passion and murder as a man plots to<br />\nhelp a woman kill her husband. 8 p.m. $4 for<br />\n'students.<br />\nThe Charles (1711 N.

Of all the hats he wears,<br />\nperhaps Costner deserves most of \u2022<br />\nthe admiration as co-producer,<br />\nfor convincing enough people in<br />\nthe film industry that a wellcrafted, entertaining Western<br />\ncould find an audience.

Sino-Western relations, mistaken<br />\nidentities (sexual, social, gender, and political,<br />\namong others) and allegory converge to create a<br />\nmemorable and affecting performance.

Domino's and<br />\nAngelo's may be convenient and<br />\ncheap, but let's face it: they sure<br />\nain't gourmet. If you hunger for<br />\nthick Chicago-style pizza with<br />\nfresh toppings and tons of cheese,<br />\nget yourself downtown to<br />\nPizzeria Uno's.<br />\nYes, Baltimore finally has a<br />\nreal Chicago-style pizzeria.<br />\nUno's in Harborplace mimics the<br />\noriginal in Chicago: black and<br />\nwhite floor tiles, and authentic<br />\nwooden bar, Hard Rock Cafestyle memorabilia and a bustling,<br />\ngood-time atmosphere. But<br />\nbecause Uno's is in Harborplace,<br />\nexpect at least a half-hour wait:<br />\nthey don't take reservations.<br />\n<br />\nWe finally sat down to a fantastic view of the Inner Harbor.<br />\nFor an appetizer we ordered simple tortilla chips with salsa. The<br />\nchips were good but generic, the<br />\nsalsa mild but unimpressive with<br />\na heavy tomato flavor.<br />\nFor entrees the three of us each<br />\nordered a pizza. Uno's serves individual 6\" pizzas so everyone<br />\ncan get what he wants. Uno's also<br />\nhas sandwiches, salads, burgers<br />\nand other American fare, but you<br />\ncan get that stuff anywhere in the<br />\nHarbor. Going to Uno's and not<br />\nordering a pizza is like going to<br />\nthe Windy City and not seeing the<br />\nSears Tower.<br />\nAt the suggestion of our fantastic waitress, Dara, I ordered<br />\nthe Spinoccoli pizza, a combination of spinach, broccoli,<br />\ncrushed tomatoes and garlic.<br />\n<br />\nDavid had a pepperoni pizza<br />\nwhile Pam selected a four-cheese<br />\npizza with tomato slices and a<br />\npesto base. Uno's has many unique pizzas to choose from, or you<br />\ncan start with the basics and add<br />\nyour toppings from there.<br />\nThe pizzas arrived promptly<br />\nand piping hot. And from the first<br />\nbite, we all knew that this was<br />\nwhat pizza was meant to be. The<br />\nreal tomato and garlic of the<br />\nSpinoccoli balanced the green<br />\nvegetables, both in terms of taste<br />\nand aesthetics. A pesto sauce was<br />\na tasty twist while the tomato<br />\nslices kept some of the traditional<br />\ncharacter in the gooey four<br />\ncheese pizza. And the pepperoni<br />\npizza was stacked high with<br />\ncheese, pepperoni and crushed<br />\ntomatoes, all the things you want<br />\nin a good pepperoni pizza.<br />\n<br />\nA 6\" pizza may not sound like<br />\na lot, but when you throw in a<br />\ngood thick crust and 1 /<br />\n1<br />\n2 inches<br />\nthick worth of veggies, meat and<br />\ncheese, you have a meal. David<br />\nand Pam couldn't make it to<br />\ndessert but on Dara's insistence<br />\nI tried the chocolate chip<br />\ncheesecake with hot fudge sauce.<br />\nThe cold cheesecake topped with<br />\nhot fudge was a deliciously rich<br />\nand gooey mess that finally left<br />\nme stuffed.<br />\nThe service was prompt, but<br />\nnot overly so, once we finally<br />\nlanded a table. Our waitress,<br />\nDara, was a high point of our<br />\nlunch, always friendly and<br />\nentertaining.<br />\nUno's prices are very<br />\nreasonable. Individual pizzas<br />\nfrom $3.50 to $5.50, with other<br />\nentrees in the same price range.<br />\n<br />\nChicago's Big Cheese<br />\nPizzeria Uno's serves up a pizza you can't refuse.<br />\nA very filling meal should cost no<br />\nmore than $10 per person.<br />\nPizzeria lItle\u00a7 has raised the<br />\npizza to new heights.

Now<br />\nreally, orange you ,glad you read this story?<br />\n<br />\nBy Don Karnage<br />\nOnce upon a time there were<br />\ntwo oranges named Ray and<br />\nLarry. They ripened together on<br />\ntwo adjacent trees in Florida. Ray<br />\nand Larry were not as round or<br />\nas orange as the other oranges.<br />\nAll the other oranges teased Larry<br />\nand Ray and bragged about their<br />\nperfect shape and color. At the<br />\npeak of the picking season Ray<br />\nand Larry were still green while<br />\nthe other oranges became fully<br />\nripe.<br />\nThe day arrived when Mr.<br />\nSunkist and Mr. Tropicana came<br />\nto pick some nice oranges for<br />\ntheir capitalistic gains. All the<br />\noranges were picked except for<br />\nRay and Larry. These two<br />\noranges hung on their tree<br />\ndisgraced and disappointed. Ray<br />\nand Larry were fed up, so they<br />\ndecided to roll to Hollywood to<br />\nbe in a Minute Maid commercial.<br />\nThe two oranges dropped from<br />\ntheir trees and began their<br />\n<br />\njourney.<br />\nThese two oranges started rolling down Interstate 10 singing<br />\n\"Born to be Wild\". Since Larry<br />\nand Ray were not used to all this<br />\ntumbling, they got very dizzy and<br />\ntired, so they stopped shortly after<br />\nthe Florida-Alabama border. Sitting on the side of the road, Larry<br />\nand Ray rested as they watched<br />\nthe cars speed along the Intersrate. Their skin was no longer<br />\nan orangish-green color. It had<br />\nturned black from all the road<br />\npollution.<br />\nWhile resting in the ditch, Ray<br />\nand Larry noticed a rotten,<br />\ndiscarded and half-smushed<br />\nbanana. They travelled over to<br />\nexamine this suffering fruit. J.R.<br />\nthe banana spoke to the two black<br />\noranges and admired what they<br />\nwere trying to do. J.R. told the<br />\nblack balls of industrial waste that<br />\nthey had a long journey ahead.<br />\nand a dangerous one at that.<br />\n<br />\nIn pain, J.R. continued his advice. He told them to be fruitful<br />\nand multiply, to plant their seed<br />\non fertile soil, and to practice safe<br />\nsex because they didn't know<br />\nwhere that dirt had been. He told<br />\nthem not to drink too much vodka<br />\nor they would be screwdrivered,<br />\nand to not play with Ouija boards<br />\nbecause they are evil. He then<br />\nreminded them to adjust their<br />\nwatches because they were in a<br />\ndifferent time zone.<br />\nBut all this talking made J.R.<br />\nexhausted. Soon after he finished speaking, he was nothing<br />\nmore than fertilizer. Larry and<br />\nRay adjusted their watches and<br />\nrolled off into the sunset on Interstate 10.<br />\nThe darkness began to fade as<br />\nthe sun appeared. The two tumbling oranges found themselves in<br />\nMississippi. Ray and Larry<br />\npulled over to enjoy the sunrise,<br />\nwhen two sexy mushrooms ap-<br />\n<br />\npeared on the scene. The sensuous 'shrooms danced towards<br />\nthe scared oranges.<br />\nThe erotic mushrooms began<br />\ncaressing, squeezing, and peeling<br />\nthe deeply aroused oranges until<br />\nthe juices flowed. In a fit of passion, the stimulated oranges<br />\nbegan to eat out the erect<br />\nmushrooms. Feelings of this sexual nature were unknown to the<br />\ntwo virgin oranges.<br />\nSoon after the excitement<br />\nended, the satisfied shrooms left,<br />\nlaughing at the two fruits.<br />\nRecovering from this experience,<br />\nthe oranges, who had travelled so<br />\nfar, did not realize that their trip<br />\nhad just begun.<br />\nWill Ray and Larry find eternal<br />\nhappiness in Hollywood? Or will<br />\nthey roll into the GulfofMexico?<br />\nAnd do you really care?

Despite the ap-<br />\n<br />\nHockey Loses to TSU<br />\nby Jay Friedman<br />\nMonday, November 19\u2014<br />\nThe Hopkins Ice Hockey Team<br />\ntook on crosstown rival and<br />\nMason-Dixon league leader<br />\nTowson State in a match at Mt<br />\nPleasant Ice Arena. Towson<br />\ndefeated the second-place Jays<br />\n8-5 in a rough game marred by<br />\nmore punches than a Buster<br />\nDouglas title bout and inept officiating. The Tigers capitalized on several Hopkins miscues at<br />\ntheir own blue line to take a 2-0<br />\nlead midway in the first period.<br />\nWhen Hopkins was called for<br />\ncross-checking in the offensive<br />\nzone, it looked like the Tigers<br />\nwere going to run away with the<br />\ngame. However, the TSU advantages were nullified by a Tiger<br />\ntripping foul 16 seconds later.<br />\nHopkins then had a brief advantage and with 2 seconds remaining in the 16-second power play.<br />\nSophomore winger Jason<br />\nSprague, shooting from the left<br />\ncircle, beat the Tiger goalie with<br />\na wrist shot to the wide side to lift<br />\nthe Jays to 1-2.<br />\nTowson came back a minute<br />\nlater and converted their third<br />\ngoal off a poor defensive play at<br />\n<br />\nthe blue line. After the goal, a<br />\nHopkins skater checked the<br />\nscorer in the boards and the<br />\nTowson player got up swinging.<br />\nSophomore Doug Conrad was<br />\nejected from the game under the<br />\nthird-man-in rule. The penalty<br />\nleft the teams playing with only<br />\nthree skaters on the ice. With<br />\nmoments remaining in the period,<br />\nTSU added another goal after a<br />\nfake drew the defense and left a<br />\nshooter open for the crossing<br />\npass.<br />\nThe rowdy partisan crowd<br />\ncheered the Tigers to a 5-1 lead<br />\nearly in the second period on a<br />\nslap shot from the right point,<br />\nHowever, midway through the<br />\nperiod the Jays strung together<br />\nback-to-back goals, one on a tight<br />\nangle from the bottom of the left<br />\ncircle, to get within two at 3-5.<br />\nAfter the minor run, the Jays'<br />\nCanadian star, Patrick Chiasson,<br />\nwas called for a cross-check<br />\nbehind the Tiger goal. Chiasson<br />\nbeat two Towson players to the<br />\npuck, weaved between them to<br />\nset up behind the net when he saw<br />\nan onrushing Towson defender.<br />\nChiasson lifted his hands (only<br />\none on the stick) and flattened the<br />\nTiger player, igniting the Jays'<br />\n<br />\nfans, especially the vocal John<br />\nDarre. However, the game had<br />\nbeen rough and the Towson<br />\nskater needed to be helped up so<br />\nthe officials thought it necessary<br />\nto call the penalty. Chiasson and<br />\nHopkins' assistant captain Dave<br />\nBoxenbaum pleaded the Jays'<br />\ncase to no avail. Fortunately,<br />\nTowson once again failed to convert during the advantage and the<br />\nperiod ended 3-5.<br />\nEarly in the third period, with<br />\nHopkins once again a man short,<br />\nthe referee indicated a delayed<br />\npenalty on Towson. Hopkins'<br />\ncaptain and goalie, Dave Bowyer,<br />\nsped to the bench for an extra attacker and the Jays scored to pull<br />\nwithin 4-5 at 12:32. Just seconds<br />\nlater a Blue Jay skater was taken<br />\ndown on a break, but the incompetent officials who must<br />\nhave been watching the Monday<br />\nNight Football game did not<br />\nmake a call.<br />\nThe Jays opened it up and appeared to be building momentum<br />\nduring the third period. Unfortunately, as is prone to happen in<br />\na wide-open game, Hopkins was<br />\nbeat in the offensive zone and<br />\nTowson converted the 2-on-. 1<br />\nContinued on page 11<br />\n<br />\nparently slow start, Hopkins, a<br />\nschool perenially strong in Division III swimming, has the potential to improve upon last year's<br />\nsuccess at Nationals where the<br />\nmen finished eighth and the<br />\nwomen tenth.<br />\nThe reason why Hopkins winloss record now, and throughout<br />\nthe season is not necessarily the<br />\nmost important measure of the<br />\nteam's success, has to do with the<br />\ncoaching strategy of Coach<br />\nGeorge Kennedy. While he and<br />\nthe team try to win every meet,<br />\nKennedy places greater emphasis<br />\non the more important Nationals<br />\nmeet at the end of the season.<br />\nKennedy, in his sixth year at<br />\nHopkins, prepares for Nationals<br />\nby switching swimmers in and<br />\nout of various events in different<br />\ncombinations from meet to meet,<br />\nhoping to fully develop the team<br />\nso it peaks in time for Nationals.<br />\n\"I definitely would like to win<br />\nevery meet, but we're going to be<br />\nmoving people around to get<br />\nthem ready for Nationals, so I<br />\ndon't think our record actually<br />\nwill indicate how strong we are,\"<br />\nsaid Kennedy. \"That is not to say<br />\nour record doesn't matter. One of<br />\nour other goals this year is to win<br />\nthe conference, and I think we<br />\ncan do that if we have a good effort.\"<br />\nHopkins' challenge to improve<br />\nupon last year's performance may<br />\nbe more of a challenge this year<br />\nbecause of the toll taken by<br />\ngraduation. The women lost three<br />\nDivision III All-Americans while<br />\nthe men lost four. Kennedy,<br />\nhowever, feels that there is still<br />\na good deal of talent and experience around which he can<br />\nbuild.<br />\n\"I think we're fortunate<br />\nbecause, particularly in the case<br />\nof the men, we have people<br />\nwho've been to Nationals and<br />\n<br />\nwho know what it takes to get<br />\nthere. I also think the team attitude is really strong, and that is<br />\nreally important in swimming<br />\nbecause it is such a mental<br />\nsport,\" said Kennedy.<br />\nKennedy is hoping for a strong<br />\nseason from senior co-captains<br />\nStever Giangrandi and Scott<br />\nEric<br />\nsophomore<br />\nMay,<br />\nSteindenger, and Jay Smith, a<br />\njunior transfer from Washington<br />\nand Lee. On the women's side<br />\nKennedy expects the team to be<br />\nled by co-captains junior Betsy<br />\nBatchelor and senior Jennifer<br />\nSosnowski, as well as junior<br />\nStephanie Dengler and senior<br />\nWendy Fenstamaker. Both<br />\nteams, according to Kennedy,<br />\nshould also benefit from a solid<br />\nclass of incoming freshmen.<br />\nMen's senior co-captain, Steve<br />\nGiangrandi, a diver, is equally<br />\noptimistic about the prospects for<br />\nthis season.<br />\n\"I think we're really strong in<br />\ndiving and we've got some strong<br />\nsprinters plus we do have some<br />\nexperience,\" said Giangrandi.<br />\nAnother factor that Kennedy<br />\nhopes will have an impact upon<br />\nthis year's team is the intangible<br />\nelement of the Hopkins swimming tradition.<br />\n\"For the last twenty years the<br />\nmen have been in the top ten at<br />\nNationals and the women have<br />\nbeen in the top ten the past few<br />\nyears, as well. That's something<br />\nI don't take credit for because I<br />\nhaven't been here that long, and<br />\nthat's something that no one person can take credit for. But I think<br />\nthat says a lot for the kind of<br />\ntradition and dedication we have<br />\nwith the swimming program here<br />\nat Hopkins,\" noted Kennedy.<br />\nWhile Kennedy and the team<br />\nhope the Hopkins swimming<br />\ntradition can carry them through<br />\nto Nationals, they have never<br />\n<br />\nforgotten that, after all, this is<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"I think one of the greatest<br />\nthings about this team is its ability<br />\nto manage the academics with the<br />\nathletics. We've had several<br />\nacademic All-Americans, and<br />\nwe're especially proud to be<br />\nrecognized for that,\" said Kennedy. \"I think the people on the<br />\nteam deserve a lot of credit<br />\nbecause practices and meets can<br />\ntake up a lot of time, but nobody<br />\never forgets how important<br />\nacademics are.\"<br />\nThe ability to balance school<br />\nwith sports is indicative of the<br />\nteam discipline and dedication<br />\nthat Kennedy feels will carry the<br />\nteams into a strong finish at<br />\nNationals.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Varsity<br />\nMen's and Women's Swimming<br />\nteams officially opened their<br />\nseason at Shippensburg,<br />\nNovember 9,followed by a home<br />\nmeet against George Washington<br />\non November 17.

The rotating, match-up<br />\nzone, which the Jays had only one<br />\nday to practice, forced the Yellow<br />\nJackets to adjust their offense and<br />\nhit from long range. Unfortunately for Hopkins, Rochester was<br />\nable to do both of these things,<br />\nespecially the latter, hitting six of<br />\nnine three-point attempts.<br />\nOffensively, Hopkins was<br />\nunable to generate open shots<br />\nwith their screen-oriented motion<br />\noffense as they could last year.<br />\nirtually every shot was contested by Rochester, whose big<br />\n<br />\nfrom someone other than Enfield<br />\nif they are to compete for the<br />\nMAC Championship<br />\n<br />\nfrontline negated Hopkins' inside<br />\ngame, which was not very formidable to begin with. Enfield,<br />\nhowever, took it upon himself to<br />\ncarry the scoring load, a la Bernard King of the Bullets. Despite<br />\ntough defense, Enfield scored 33<br />\npoints, including 22 in the second<br />\nhalf, mostly on pull-up jumpers<br />\noff the dribble. Two or three<br />\nyears ago, Enfield was mostly a<br />\nstand-up jump shooter, but has<br />\napparently added a few moves to<br />\nhis repertoire.<br />\n<br />\nThe much awaited 1990-91<br />\nbasketball season is finally underway, and Johns Hopkins opened<br />\nup by winning three of its first<br />\nfour contests, including a defeat<br />\nof Catholic University and two<br />\nwins over St. Mary's College of<br />\nMaryland. The Blue Jays' only<br />\nloss was to the Hampden-Sidney<br />\nTigers in the championship game<br />\nof the tournament hosted by that<br />\nschool.<br />\nHopkins drew St. Mary's in the<br />\nfirst round of the HampdenSydney Classic and grounded the<br />\nSeahawks 87-75 on the strength<br />\nof Andy Enfield's 31 points came<br />\nas no surprise, but Hastings' inside play seemed to catch St.<br />\nMary's unprepared as he scored<br />\na career high 18 points on 6-9<br />\nshooting. Point guard Dave<br />\nEikenberg picked up where he<br />\nleft off last season, dishing out six<br />\nassists, notching three steals, and<br />\nholding Seahawks point guard<br />\nQuentin Hillsman to four points<br />\nand no assists.<br />\nWhatever momentum the Jays<br />\npicked up against St. Mary's was<br />\ncompletely lost when they were<br />\nblown out by Hampden-Sydney<br />\nin the championship game.<br />\nHopkins was badly outplayed on<br />\nboth ends of the floor, falling<br />\n73-56. Hampden-Sydney was<br />\nrepeatedly able to get the ball inside to their big men, especially<br />\nRussell Turner, who scored 23<br />\npoints in 24 minutes. The Tigers<br />\nwould swing the ball around the<br />\nperimeter and flash people across<br />\nthe lane, creating passing angles.<br />\nToo often Hopkins' defenders<br />\ntrailed the cutting Tigers and<br />\nwere unable to close off the passing lanes. Without a legitimate<br />\nshot-blocker patrolling the middie, Hopkins was burned for 44<br />\npoints on 59 percent shooting in<br />\nthe first .half.<br />\nThe Jays' offense was shut<br />\ndown by the Tigers, who played<br />\na tough man-to-man defense and<br />\nwere able to avoid picks and<br />\nscreens set for Enfield and Jay<br />\nGangemi. This made open shots<br />\nextremely rare, and Hopkins shot<br />\nonly 36 percent for the game.<br />\nHopkins fell behind by sixteen<br />\npoints at halftime and by 29 midway through the second half,<br />\nprompting head coach Bill Nelson<br />\nto play the freshman crop for<br />\nmost of the second half. If one<br />\nwas to look for a silver lining in<br />\nthis game, the play of the second<br />\n<br />\nEnfield's hot shooting was not<br />\nenough to overcome Rochester,<br />\nwhich led from start to finish.<br />\nThe Jays managed to cut the lead<br />\nto two points on several occasions, but the Yellow Jackets<br />\nalways had an answer\u2014usually<br />\nPetrosky nailing an open jump<br />\nshot.

He found the perception<br />\nboth \"disturbing\" and \"damaging to communities\" because it<br />\n\"distorts reality.\"<br />\nChong said that in New York<br />\nCity, fifteen percent of Asians<br />\ndrop out of high school. According to a United Way survey, he<br />\nsaid, thirty percent of Asians in<br />\nNew York live at or below the<br />\npoverty level while only twentyfive percent of non-Asians do.<br />\nChong also noted that poverty in<br /><br />\n-Elisse Tukara<br /><br />\nBill Chong, president of Asian-Americans for Equality, discusses 'The<br />\nModel Minority' as part of the 1990 M.S.E. Symposium.<br /><br />\nChinatown is twenty-five percent<br />\nversus a city-wide rate of seventeen percent.<br />\nThe distortion of reality, according to Chong, had made efforts<br />\nto house homeless families in<br />\nChinatown difficult. The government felt that there was no problem, he said. Only after a tragic<br />\nfire were there results for the<br />\n\"hidden homeless,\"he said.<br />\nChong said that there is also a<br />\n\"destructive aspect\" to the<br />\n\"stigma of model minority.\"<br />\nPerceptions that \"Asians are better. . .creates tremendous resentment,\" according to Chong. The<br />\nsubliminal message being sent out<br />\nby the media, said Chong, is<br />\n\"why can't other minorities be<br />\nlike Asians?\"<br />\nChong also argued that the<br />\ndecline of the United States has<br />\nled to resentment, especially<br />\ntowards Japan. He cited a Time<br />\npoll which showed an eight percent increase in American resentment towards the Japanese from<br />\n1987 to 1990, while resentment<br />\nSoviets declined<br />\ntoward<br />\nmarkedly.<br />\nChong noted that the sale of<br />\nUniversal/MCA to Japan prompted a New York Newsday<br />\nheadline which questioned the<br />\nsale of movie companies to<br />\nforeign investors, while the sale<br />\nof MGM/UA to an Italian group<br />\ngot \"nowhere near the media attention.\"<br />\nDespite the media's negative<br />\nportrayal of foreign investment,<br /><br />\naccording to Chong, an MIT<br />\nstudy showed that the effects of<br />\nsuch investments are positive.<br />\n\"The US is facing a capital shortage,\" Chong said. \"They<br />\nwouldn't be here if there were<br />\nnecessary capital.\"<br />\nChong pointed to certain problems in US society which need to<br />\nbe addressed to explain the increased number of racial incidents against Asians. Specifically, he said that the United States<br />\nmust retool basic industries and<br />\nreinvest in education and<br />\ncommunities.<br />\nAccording to Chong, incidents<br />\nlike the Flatbush boycott of a<br />\nKorean merchant are symbolic of<br />\n\"two disenfranchised groups pitted against one another.\" He also<br />\nsaid that the \"media missed the<br />\nboat on the issue\" by superficially calling it a racist boycott.<br />\nWhile he agreed that blacks are<br />\ncapable of racism, Chong said<br />\nthat the real enemies are banks<br />\nwhich wield institutional racism.<br />\nHe suggested that banks' unwillingness to make loans to poor<br />\ncommunities amounts to racism.<br />\nCommunity leaders need to<br />\nbuild effective coalitions, according to Chong. He warned that it<br />\nis more difficult today, in a<br />\n\"climate of survivalism.\" Chong<br />\nalso said that it is important to get<br />\nresources channelled into communities and to \"go after the real<br />\nenemy: banks which are failing<br />\nto provide capital.\"<br /><br />\nBainerman Discusses Viability<br />\nOf Separate Palestinian State<br />\nby Bill Van Horne<br />\nJoel Bainerman discussed the<br />\neconomic and political dimensions of a separate Palestinian<br />\nstate in a lecture entitled \"What<br />\nWould Happen If.. .The Viability of a Palestinian State,\" on<br />\nWednesday, November 28.

If America defeats Iraq,<br />\nthe situation will get worse, and<br />\nnot better. I can assure you that<br />\nwhatever comes after Saddam<br />\nHussein will be far worse.\"<br />\nBainerman focused on the<br />\nPalestinians in the West Bank and<br />\nGaza Strip, addressing the problems of creating a separate<br />\nPalestinian state. \"If a Palestinian<br />\nstate was politically stable for 10<br />\nor 15 years,\" he said, \"[the<br />\nbe<br />\ncould<br />\nPalestinians]<br />\neconomically prosperous.\"<br />\nHe asked, however, \"Where<br />\nwould the money come from for<br />\na Palestinian state? $25 billion<br />\nover 10 years would be needed.\"<br />\nWhile Bainerman said that the<br />\nPalestinians believe that other<br />\nArab countries would donate<br />\nfunds, he also said that \"like a lot<br />\nof Palestinian assumptions, that<br />\nis quite unrealistic. No one will<br />\nput money into an unstable<br />\npolitical economy.\"<br />\nBainerman discussed the instability that would be present in<br />\nthe West Bank or the Gaza Strip.<br />\n\"The moment you have a Palestinian state, millions will want to<br />\ncome back,\" he said. In<br />\nreference to the West Bank, he<br />\nsaid, \"Refugees have been<br />\nbrought up to believe Israel is the<br />\nenemy.

According to several modern theorists,<br />\nhe said, the Torah is made up of<br /><br />\na number of different documents<br />\nwritten by various people and<br />\npulled together over a period of<br />\ntime.<br />\nIn his attempt to discover<br />\nwhich of these theories comes<br />\nclosest to the truth, Goldfinger<br />\nused \"Torah Codes\" as<br />\nevidence. \"Torah Codes,\"<br />\nGoldfinger said, are ways in<br />\nwhich the author of the Torah<br />\ncommunicates messages and<br />\nideas to those who study it.<br />\nHe referred to two aspects of<br />\nthe Torah to establish the<br />\nlegitimacy of these codes. First,<br />\nhe said, the Torah is the communication by God to man: a<br />\nrevelation. It follows, Goldfinger<br />\nargued, that each letter of the<br />\nTorah is precious and must be<br />\nintact.<br />\nSecond, it is the plan of creation, he said. The Torah was<br />\ncreated before the world and the<br />\nworld was created only so the<br />\nTorah could be put into effect.<br /><br />\nGoldfinger gave an example of<br />\nparents being created in order to<br />\nbe honored. Therefore, deduced<br />\nGoldfinger, everything in the<br />\nworld must be found in the<br />\nTorah.<br />\nHaving set down the basic<br />\nfoundations for his arguments,<br />\nGoldfinger began his story. In<br />\n1917, he said, the Chairman of<br />\nthe Department of Mathematics<br />\nat Harvard University attempted<br />\nto prove divine origination of the<br />\nBible by looking at the only<br />\noriginal portion, the Hebrew text<br />\nof the Old Testament.<br />\nHe studied the text, Goldfinger<br />\nsaid, and found several complicated number patterns which<br />\nwould have been too complex to<br />\nhave been contrived by a human.<br />\nHe challenged several colleagues<br />\nto create a similar number pattern<br />\nand they were unable to do so.<br />\nCould this pattern have been accidental?

With<br />\nmoney and student commitment in perennial short supply, it can<br />\nbecome a herculean task just to produce an average issue of the NewsLetter, Zeniada, or The Spectator, to name only three. Administrators<br />\naren't much help; students often have to scramble for initial funding,<br />\nthen claw their way through budget hearings each year. Though campus publications, we are so often told, are \"useful\" and \"beneficial<br />\nto the community,\" they nonetheless remain the same as any other<br />\ncampus group\u2014no special treatment is the rule.<br />\nThe semi-annual Course Guide should be an exception to such<br />\nsystematic indifference; there is no campus publication with as much<br />\npotential to monitor and, where necessary, improve the quality of<br />\neducation at Hopkins. The Guide comprises student evaluations of<br />\ncourses and instructors, which are tabulated from the responses of<br />\nthe students in a given class. It grandiosely\u2014and appropriately\u2014<br />\nblesses or damns the instructors with a numerical rating and pegs<br />\nthe course with a letter grade. It's an increasingly important function within an institution where the non-English-speaking T.A., swelling seminar class, and somnolent professor have become distressingly commonplace. The Guide 's function, as we understand it, is<br />\nto help warn students away from such disasters\u2014and to alert them<br />\nto whatever gems the Listing of Courses may be hiding.<br />\nIn practice, however, the Guide is rather impoverished. It prints<br />\nlistings not merely of the courses offered in the coming semester,<br />\nbut of any course from the previous spring that received sufficient<br />\ndata. This makes for a puzzling read at times; each issue contains<br />\n\"reviews\" of courses that may not be offered this year\u2014or possibly<br />\never again. It would be far simpler to list courses for the coming<br />\nsemester in one section, and the non-repeating courses in another.<br />\nMore important are the results themselves, which range from comprehensive to mystifying to useless. One typical entry in the current<br />\nissue praises a Sociology class for its able and helpful T.A.s, but<br />\ngives none of their names. Numerous other listings cite the student<br />\nsample without a second number\u2014\"38/?\" to take one example. How<br />\ncan a reader gauge the accuracy of the data without knowing what<br />\npercentage they represent? Surely the Guide staff had access to such<br />\nuncontroversial figures. An astonishing number of courses are omitted<br />\nentirely from the Guide: every single offering by the Departments<br />\nof English and History and substantial numbers of those in<br />\nHumanities, Civil Engineering, Mathematics, and beyond.<br />\nClearly, improvement is needed if the Course Guide is to fulfill<br />\nits mission. The first step toward that goal would be to ensure that<br />\nit has the kind of staff it needs to do a complicated and maddening<br />\ntask. This is where the administration could step in, either by a) offering personnel to help in obtaining and compiling the data or b)<br />\nestablishing a payroll account substantial enough to maintain a decent work force at semester's end, when even the most selfless of<br />\nvolunteers disappear to save their GPAs.<br />\nEqually important, the administration should install a mechanism\u2014<br />\npreferably through the deans of Arts and Sciences and Engineering\u2014to<br />\nensure that professors and T.A.s pass out course evaluation forms<br /><br />\nand get them to the Guide quickly and without interference. If the<br />\ndeans and instructors protest that they don't have time, as likely they<br />\nwill, then the Guide staff should make regular reports to President<br />\nRichardson about the quality of various academic departments; that's<br />\nin effect what its job is, anyway. The Guide isn't a Sharper Image<br />\ncatalog manufactured for aimless student-consumers; it is there to<br />\nevaluate the faculty and courses of this University\u2014something which<br />\nany instructor or dean should take seriously.<br />\nBut the Course Guide has to earn that respect. Even without any<br />\nhelp from the administration, there are several changes it could enact<br />\nto make the whole process easier and more informative for all<br />\nconcerned:<br />\nFirst, redesign the evaluation forms. Most people are so frazzled<br />\nat semester's end that they struggle with filling out a deposit slip,<br />\nmuch less the convoluted, redundant queries on the student response<br />\nforms. Leave out questions about what was required for the course\u2014<br />\nask that on a separate instructor's form\u2014and concentrate on getting<br />\nopinions about the lectures and sections. More quotes from students<br />\nwould enliven the Guide tremendously; make sure there is ample opportunity to give them. In addition, find out what kind of readings<br />\nand papers a course requires. One instructor may expect 200 pages<br />\nof literary theory reading each week, with written summaries; another<br />\nmay assign 200 pages of Ecosystems and You, replete with cartoons<br />\nof evolving tadpoles. Recognize the difference, and weigh them<br />\naccordingly.<br />\nTake special care when reviewing courses such as language<br />\nElements, or Molecular Cell Biology, or International Monetary<br />\nEconomics. Required courses that attract such large numbers deserve<br />\na more explicit treatment than a seminar might, if only because they<br />\nloom so large in Hopkins legend. Find out who the most painless<br />\nTAs are, as well as the best ones, and give them recognition. Suggest tips for coping with the gargantuan class sizes, when applicable,<br />\nand what to do about navigating the reserve room. Most important<br />\nof all, render course descriptions in more interesting prose. Many<br />\nof the current entries are roughly as vivid as the average telegraph<br />\nmessage; it doesn't have to be that way. Faculty and students, for<br />\ntheir part, can help chiefly by cooperating with the Guide as much<br />\nas possible. Instructors should make certain they they distribute and<br />\ncollect the forms; students, similarly, should fill them out<br />\nthoughtfully\u2014it only takes about three minutes, and the benefits to<br />\nothers can be immense. Any student with a little extra time should<br />\nvolunteer it to the Guide to help with copy editing, assembling data,<br />\nor\u2014ideally\u2014restructuring the whole operation.<br />\nIt is always awkward when one campus publication puts another<br />\nunder the magnifying glass; often it is just an excuse to express condescension, sibling rivalry, or pointless malice. But the News-Letter<br />\nsees incalculable potential in the Course Guide, both as it is and how<br />\nit might be. With a few modifications and some consistent support<br />\nfrom the Hopkins community, it could eventually become the \"better mousetrap\" that Hopkins so badly needs.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br /><br />\nEpisode Ten: Tis the Season<br />\nMiranda slept on the train ride<br />\nhome from Thanksgiving at<br />\nCarol's. The girl sitting next to<br />\nher had her Walkman blaring<br />\nChristmas carols, and Miranda<br />\nwinced, remembering the onset<br />\nof the holiday season.<br />\nThe radio was worthless.<br />\nUsually Miranda listened to one<br />\nof those east coast progressive<br />\nrock stations; it gave her the opportunity to listen to all those<br />\nsongs that she liked so much in<br />\nLos Angeles three years ago.<br />\nBut come November 16, there<br />\nwas nowhere to turn. The moment Miranda had been dreading<br />\nhad arrived.<br />\nIts arrival was announced by<br />\nBig Dave Wild, after playing<br />\ntwelve big rock wild hits<br />\ncommercial-free. There was a<br />\nbrief moment of station identification, and then out of<br />\nnowhere came the opening chords<br />\nof \"Feliz Navidad.\"<br />\nMiranda froze for a moment<br />\nwith horror, her eyes widened<br />\nnoticeably, and she slowly<br />\nturned to face the portable stereo<br />\nunit that was assaulting her. Her<br />\nhand shot out with the speed of<br />\na snake in a box, desperate to end<br />\nthe offending music.<br />\nBut nothing she could do now<br />\ncould halt the core of the problem<br />\nthat faced her. One way or<br />\nanother, she would have to face<br />\nthe truth: holiday season was<br />\nhere.<br />\nThat evening, she headed off to<br />\npractice with the dance company,<br />\nher sole extracurricular activity.<br />\nBy that point, she had pushed the<br />\nmemory of the slowly encroaching season to the back of<br />\nher mind. It wasn't that Miranda<br />\ndidn't like the holiday season, just<br />\nthat she wished that it didn't start<br />\nuntil she was home to enjoy it.<br />\nThe Christmas season always<br />\nreminded her of David, more so<br />\nthan other seasons, because it was<br />\nthe day before Christmas that he<br />\nhad asked her out.<br />\nShe was crossing the street to<br /><br />\nget to campus when the second<br />\nomen made itself known to her.<br />\nUp on a telephone pole, a city<br />\nworker was busy affixing a red<br />\ntinsel Christmas tree. As Miranda looked, she saw that the entire street was lined with tinsel<br /><br />\nIt wasn't that Miranda<br />\ndidn't like the holiday<br />\nseason, she just wished<br />\nthat it didn't start<br />\nuntil she was home<br />\ntrees, red and white and silver.<br />\nIn this day and age, she knew<br />\nenough not to wonder about<br />\ngreen.<br />\nThankfully, dance rehearsal<br />\nwent without difficulty (difficulty as Miranda defined it had to do<br />\nwith any contact with trees,<br />\nChristmas carols, snow, AT&amp;T<br />\n\"reach out\" commercials, and of<br />\ncourse, \"Feliz Navidad\"). They<br />\npracticed a few Laurie Anderson<br />\nroutines (half the reason Miranda liked dance), warmed up,<br />\nwarmed down, and got to wear<br />\nleotards. If there were ever a type<br />\nof clothing that could gainsay the<br />\nholiday season, it was leotards.<br />\nOn the way back to her apartment, Miranda noticed that the<br />\nworker was gone. The street was<br />\ncompletely buried in tinsel, and<br />\nnow little colored lights had been<br />\nturned on. Still no green.<br />\nCarol was watching some<br />\ntelevision, and Doris was cooking. Good: nothing was out of the<br />\nordinary. If her roommates could<br />\nonly make it to Thanksgiving<br />\nwithout bringing up holiday<br />\ncheer, Miranda wouldn't have to<br />\nkill them.<br />\nShe slumped down on the<br />\ncouch next to Carol.<br />\n\"You comiong with me for<br />\nThanksgiving?\" Carol asked.<br />\n\"Sure,\" Miranda said.<br />\n\"Cool.

I wish to report the<br />\nBoard's insult to common sense and<br />\nits abuse of the English language in<br />\ncategorizing the offense as \"sexual<br />\nharassment.\"<br />\nThe Board's reasoning is difficult<br />\nto fathom from your report, but I'll<br />\ntry to reconstruct it. We may assume<br />\nthat the offending phrase, \"Suck my<br />\ndick,\" if uttered to a male member<br />\nof the community would no longer<br />\nconstitute sexual harassment but<br />\nwould be censured as a deplorable<br />\nvulgarity. Alternatively, if an<br />\nequivalent formula like \"Kiss my<br />\nass\" had been addressed to an<br />\nargumentative female, this would<br />\npresumably no longer constitute<br />\nsexual harrassment, but rather the<br />\npersonal affront that it is. Since it<br />\nseems precisely this insult as<br />\ndelivered to a female that gives<br />\ngrounds for supposing it a sexual offense, are we to understand that it is<br />\nsome form of invitation or even<br />\ncoercion to a sexual encounter? The<br />\ncircumstances of the affair hardly<br />\nseem propitious.

Approximately two days before Thanksgiving Break, residents were informed<br />\nof a change in the smoking policy<br />\nthrough a well-hidden column entry<br />\nin the pseudo-publication \"Residential Rap.\" Then, on November 25,<br />\na sign appeared in the AMR 11 mail<br />\nroom stating that \"A survey was<br />\ndone by your res. life rep revealing<br />\nan overwhelming desire to prohibit<br />\nsmoking on 'on campus' and `off<br />\ncampus' housing. As a result RAB<br />\nwould like to inform you that NO<br />\nSMOKING is allowed on<br />\nHALLWAYS, STAIRWELLS, or<br />\nBATHROOMS after 11-24-90.\"<br />\nNow I realize that smoking has<br />\nbeen banned in governmental and<br />\nsome local public areas, and these<br />\nlaws have been upheld in the courts.<br />\nHowever, the RAB has overlooked<br />\none important element: The areas<br />\nwhere smoking is banned are not<br />\nwhere people live. We live here, and<br />\npaid thousands of hard earned<br />\ndollars to do so. Because of this, we<br />\nshould have all of the comforts of<br />\nhome, or at least the comforts of a<br />\ncomparable apartment complex. To<br />\ndeny us the right to smoke as we<br />\nenter or leave the building, or when<br />\nwe use the rest rooms, makes us feel<br />\nas though we don't live here and are<br />\nnot welcome. We would not pay<br />\nthousands of dollars to feel<br />\nunwelcome.<br />\nAnother problem with the new<br />\nrule is that smokers must leave the<br />\nonly common areas we have if we<br />\nwant to smoke. Because there are no<br />\nlounges here, the hallways are the<br />\ncommon areas, and now smokers are<br />\nnot welcome there.<br />\nAs for the \"survey\" that Res. Life<br /><br />\nclaims to have taken, no member of<br />\nBuilding A, or Gildersleeve, Griffin,<br />\nor Jennings houses have told me that<br />\nthey even received a survey. Where<br />\nexactly is this \"overwhelming\" demand coming from? Not from the<br />\npeople who live in housing,<br />\napparently.<br />\nI must also question the action that<br />\nthe RAB took. Why simply eliminate<br />\nsmoking? Why not allow for<br />\ndesignated areas within housing<br />\nwhere we can smoke? This issue<br />\ndoes not have to be all or nothing,<br />\nas the RAB seems to think it must<br />\nbe.<br />\nThis issue affects so many people<br />\nthat the RAB should have informed<br />\nthe residents that this issue was going to be discussed, so that our comments were welcomed. Before this<br />\ndecision was made, no information<br />\nwas given at all, not by Res. Life,<br />\nthe RAB, or by individual representatives. An issue this large should<br />\nhave been discussed in a public<br />\nforum, perhaps with a vote of the<br />\nresidents, not by some body that<br />\nclaims to represent our views, then<br />\ndenies us our rights.<br />\nMy advice to the other smokers in<br />\nuniversity housing is simple: blaze<br />\nup the hallways, so that the people<br />\nwho made up this stupid, unnecessary, and repugnant rule, know<br />\nexactly how we feel.<br />\nAndrew Whitman<br />\nClass of 1994<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am both concerned and disturbed by the apparent recent decision by<br />\nthe Hopkins administration to require future members .of the<br />\nsophomore class to live in university housing, specifically McCoy and<br />\nWolman Hall following their<br />\nrenovations. Very few reasons for<br />\nthis new requirement have come to<br /><br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br /><br />\nlight, and even fewer goirci reasons<br />\nhave appeared. Plenty of problemshave, however.<br />\nOne of the biggest problems to the<br />\nstudents affected by this plan is the<br />\nhuge increase in the cost of living for<br />\nstudents during sophomore year. According to Bettye Miller, university<br />\nhousing will be \"competitively priced\" with private housing. As any<br />\nHopkins student who has ever priced local housing knows, she is either<br />\nbadly misinformed, or lying through<br />\nher teeth. Sure, it is possible to spend<br />\nmore on housing and food in the<br />\nprivate sector while a student here,<br />\nbut it is also a hell of a lot easier to<br />\nspend a good deal less. According<br />\nto Dean Boswell, the cost for<br />\nsophomore housing will be comparable to living in the dorms, and<br />\nthis probably means the cost for<br />\nbuildings A or B rather than the<br />\nAMRs, since the accommodations<br />\nwill be similar. As past residents of<br />\nthese dorms know, these dorms are<br />\na fair amount more expensive than<br />\nprivate housing, and much the worse<br />\nin living conditions. Since it is admitted that the kitchenettes in these<br />\nnew dorms will not be very useful<br />\nfor cooking, the purchase of a meal<br />\nplan will be required. The number<br />\nof upperclassmen on the present<br />\nmeal plan should indicate something<br />\nof its popularity, value and quality.<br />\nWe are assured, however, that the<br />\nnew \"food court\" concept will be<br />\nmuch better. Yeah, right. Multiple<br />\noutlets dispensing bad food still<br />\nequals bad food.(One related question: Will all of these outlets be run<br />\nby Seiler's, as the Terrace Room,<br />\nSnack Bar, and Levering are now,<br />\nor have our administrators finally<br />\nlearned about the principles of competition in a market?)<br />\nIn addition to the increased cost<br />\nthat will be incurred by required<br />\nuniversity housing, students must<br />\nalso deal with a loss of a great deal<br />\nof privacy and independence. A<br />\nlarge majority of, if not all, of the<br />\nrooms will be doubles, with two<br />\ndoubles sharing a bathroom. In case<br />\nthe Hopkins administration has not<br />\nrealized it yet, most people like having some space to themselves, frequently in the form of a bathroom.<br />\nMost students that share bedrooms<br />\nin apartments and houses now do it<br />\nto save money and get a better, not<br />\nworse deal on housing. Also, after<br />\nfreshman year, many students are<br />\ntired of dealing with housemasters.<br />\nWill these new housemaster/CA's<br />\nconduct room checks for illicit popcorn poppers and microwaves?

This<br />\nsignals some effort on the part of<br />\nthe editors,just not enough. How<br />\nuseful is this publication?<br />\nLaborious examinations of the<br />\nlistings reveal that of the 358<br />\nundergraduate courses offered<br />\nlast spring (excluding research<br />\nand independent study), 122 are<br />\nreviewed in the Fall 1990 Course<br />\nGuide. That's about 34 percent.<br />\nSo right off the bat, 66 percent<br />\nof all the courses offered last<br />\nspring are not mentioned.<br />\nIn theory, the guide should<br />\ncover what will be offered in the<br />\nupcoming semester. But only 87<br />\nof the 122 courses reviewed are<br />\nscheduled for next semester, so<br />\n29 percent of what was reviewed is not immediately relevant. More telling is what is absent. Of the approximately 350<br />\ncourses offered next semester, the<br />\nGuide contains reviews of 87.<br />\nThat's only 24 percent coverage,<br />\nwhich leaves a great void of information.

Quite<br />\nsimply, many students look forward<br />\nto moving out of the dorms and away<br />\nfrom these petty harassments.<br />\nIn the end, it all comes down to<br />\na very simple question: Why do the<br />\nHopkins administrators feel that it is<br />\nnecessary to cram this \"feeling of<br />\ncommunity\" down our throats? if<br />\nsome students wish to live in these<br />\nnew university housing units, as undoubtedly many will, then great.<br />\nMore power to them.

The<br />\nStation, through that Wednesday<br />\nmorning, maintained that our event<br />\nwould still go on despite the financial woes that they have been experiencing. Some miscommunication between the individuals in the<br />\nStation's management and the new<br />\nowners led to their momentary lapse<br />\nof professionalism and as a result the<br />\nSenior Class was informed the very<br />\nafternoon that our event was to take<br />\nplace.<br />\nUpon learning this, the Senior<br />\nClass acted by informing as many<br />\npeople as possible. The escort van<br />\nservice was informed not to take<br />\npeople to the Station, the IFC was<br />\nasked to announce the news at their<br />\nmeeting, posters were put up at the<br />\nHoops games, MSE, Hut, the Station's doors, and all those who were<br />\nremembered as having intentions of<br />\nattending the event were notified by<br />\nphone calls throughout the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe student body can expect a<br />\nhigh degree of professionalism from<br />\nthe Senior Class leadership.

Also missing (that is,<br />\nomitted entirely) are Anthropology, Chemistry (where<br />\nare the Gryder and Principe supporters?), Chinese, and Korean.<br />\nOf course, if the Course Guide<br />\nis not comprehensive, it serves no<br />\npurpose. Why does it have these<br />\nproblems? The answer is that the<br />\nwhole operation is poorly run,<br />\nand has been for years. That,<br />\ncompounded by the apathetic attitude displayed by the students<br />\ntoward filling out forms, and the<br />\nparanoia of some of the professors, make it a crippled if not<br />\nmoribund repository of information.

The main attraction running Friday<br />\nthrough Sunday is a great example of French poetic<br />\nrealism by director Marcel Came and surrealist poet<br />\nand scriptwriter Jacques Prevert. Their famous<br />\nromantic epic Children of Paradise (1943-45; 7:00<br />\nand 10:15 p.m. Call for matinee times), using the<br />\nstory of an affair between a woman and a pantomimist, explores the themes of the relationship between life and art, and realisty and theater. Since this<br />\nmasterpiece is just over three hours, the other feature<br />\nis a collection of short subjects by Emile Cole. From<br />\nDec 3-6, the Orpheum presents La Nuit De Varennes(1982, dir. Ettore Scola; 7:15), a comedy of ideas<br />\nbringing together Marcell\u00b0 Mastroianni, Harvey<br />\nKeitel and others as Thomas Paine, Casanova on the<br />\neve of the French Revolution. At 10:00 p.m. is Danton (1982, dir. Andrew Wajda), starring Gerard<br />\nDepardieu in another spectacular performance, this<br />\ntime set during the Reigh of Terror following the<br />\nFrench Revolution.<br />\nOn campus: Continuing the military theme in these<br />\njingoistic times, Weekend Wonderflix is going<br />\nhighbrow this week, with a screening of The Cook,<br />\nthe Thief, His Wife and Her Lover(1990, dir. Peter<br />\nGreenaway; Fri and Sat at 8 &amp; 10:15 in Shriver<br />\nHall). Greenaway, whose films are always controversial, whether involving the detachment in the quest<br />\nfor knowledge or the taboo of cannibalism, is a<br />\nmaster allusioninst. CTWL draws on Jacobean<br />\nrevenge plays, Swift, Rabelais, and paintings to<br />\ncreate his tableaux. The result is stunning, accompanied by another Michael Nyman score. Going for<br />\nthe lowbrow crowd is the Senior Class Film Series,<br />\nwhich presents Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, John<br />\nDeBello's 1980 attempt at comedy. The title alone<br />\nis worthy of some sort of prize, but the content<br />\ndoesn't measure up. Women in Prison (Sunday at<br />\n7 &amp; 9 in Shriver), the Reel World offering on Sunday, is probably not as bad as it sounds. This one<br />\npromises humiliation, dehumanization and bonding,<br />\nif not bondage. Admission to each of the above is<br />\n$2 for students, $3 general.<br />\nTonight only at 8 p.m. Maryland Institute/College<br />\nof Art (1300 W. Mt.

Of all the hats he wears,<br />\nperhaps Costner deserves most of \u2022<br />\nthe admiration as co-producer,<br />\nfor convincing enough people in<br />\nthe film industry that a wellcrafted, entertaining Western<br />\ncould find an audience.

Domino's and<br />\nAngelo's may be convenient and<br />\ncheap, but let's face it: they sure<br />\nain't gourmet. If you hunger for<br />\nthick Chicago-style pizza with<br />\nfresh toppings and tons of cheese,<br />\nget yourself downtown to<br />\nPizzeria Uno's.<br />\nYes, Baltimore finally has a<br />\nreal Chicago-style pizzeria.<br />\nUno's in Harborplace mimics the<br />\noriginal in Chicago: black and<br />\nwhite floor tiles, and authentic<br />\nwooden bar, Hard Rock Cafestyle memorabilia and a bustling,<br />\ngood-time atmosphere. But<br />\nbecause Uno's is in Harborplace,<br />\nexpect at least a half-hour wait:<br />\nthey don't take reservations.<br /><br />\nWe finally sat down to a fantastic view of the Inner Harbor.<br />\nFor an appetizer we ordered simple tortilla chips with salsa. The<br />\nchips were good but generic, the<br />\nsalsa mild but unimpressive with<br />\na heavy tomato flavor.<br />\nFor entrees the three of us each<br />\nordered a pizza. Uno's serves individual 6\" pizzas so everyone<br />\ncan get what he wants. Uno's also<br />\nhas sandwiches, salads, burgers<br />\nand other American fare, but you<br />\ncan get that stuff anywhere in the<br />\nHarbor. Going to Uno's and not<br />\nordering a pizza is like going to<br />\nthe Windy City and not seeing the<br />\nSears Tower.<br />\nAt the suggestion of our fantastic waitress, Dara, I ordered<br />\nthe Spinoccoli pizza, a combination of spinach, broccoli,<br />\ncrushed tomatoes and garlic.<br /><br />\nDavid had a pepperoni pizza<br />\nwhile Pam selected a four-cheese<br />\npizza with tomato slices and a<br />\npesto base. Uno's has many unique pizzas to choose from, or you<br />\ncan start with the basics and add<br />\nyour toppings from there.<br />\nThe pizzas arrived promptly<br />\nand piping hot. And from the first<br />\nbite, we all knew that this was<br />\nwhat pizza was meant to be. The<br />\nreal tomato and garlic of the<br />\nSpinoccoli balanced the green<br />\nvegetables, both in terms of taste<br />\nand aesthetics. A pesto sauce was<br />\na tasty twist while the tomato<br />\nslices kept some of the traditional<br />\ncharacter in the gooey four<br />\ncheese pizza. And the pepperoni<br />\npizza was stacked high with<br />\ncheese, pepperoni and crushed<br />\ntomatoes, all the things you want<br />\nin a good pepperoni pizza.<br /><br />\nA 6\" pizza may not sound like<br />\na lot, but when you throw in a<br />\ngood thick crust and 1 /<br />\n1<br />\n2 inches<br />\nthick worth of veggies, meat and<br />\ncheese, you have a meal. David<br />\nand Pam couldn't make it to<br />\ndessert but on Dara's insistence<br />\nI tried the chocolate chip<br />\ncheesecake with hot fudge sauce.<br />\nThe cold cheesecake topped with<br />\nhot fudge was a deliciously rich<br />\nand gooey mess that finally left<br />\nme stuffed.<br />\nThe service was prompt, but<br />\nnot overly so, once we finally<br />\nlanded a table. Our waitress,<br />\nDara, was a high point of our<br />\nlunch, always friendly and<br />\nentertaining.<br />\nUno's prices are very<br />\nreasonable.

Now<br />\nreally, orange you ,glad you read this story?<br /><br />\nBy Don Karnage<br />\nOnce upon a time there were<br />\ntwo oranges named Ray and<br />\nLarry. They ripened together on<br />\ntwo adjacent trees in Florida. Ray<br />\nand Larry were not as round or<br />\nas orange as the other oranges.<br />\nAll the other oranges teased Larry<br />\nand Ray and bragged about their<br />\nperfect shape and color. At the<br />\npeak of the picking season Ray<br />\nand Larry were still green while<br />\nthe other oranges became fully<br />\nripe.<br />\nThe day arrived when Mr.<br />\nSunkist and Mr. Tropicana came<br />\nto pick some nice oranges for<br />\ntheir capitalistic gains. All the<br />\noranges were picked except for<br />\nRay and Larry. These two<br />\noranges hung on their tree<br />\ndisgraced and disappointed. Ray<br />\nand Larry were fed up, so they<br />\ndecided to roll to Hollywood to<br />\nbe in a Minute Maid commercial.<br />\nThe two oranges dropped from<br />\ntheir trees and began their<br /><br />\njourney.<br />\nThese two oranges started rolling down Interstate 10 singing<br />\n\"Born to be Wild\". Since Larry<br />\nand Ray were not used to all this<br />\ntumbling, they got very dizzy and<br />\ntired, so they stopped shortly after<br />\nthe Florida-Alabama border. Sitting on the side of the road, Larry<br />\nand Ray rested as they watched<br />\nthe cars speed along the Intersrate. Their skin was no longer<br />\nan orangish-green color. It had<br />\nturned black from all the road<br />\npollution.<br />\nWhile resting in the ditch, Ray<br />\nand Larry noticed a rotten,<br />\ndiscarded and half-smushed<br />\nbanana. They travelled over to<br />\nexamine this suffering fruit. J.R.<br />\nthe banana spoke to the two black<br />\noranges and admired what they<br />\nwere trying to do. J.R. told the<br />\nblack balls of industrial waste that<br />\nthey had a long journey ahead.<br />\nand a dangerous one at that.<br /><br />\nIn pain, J.R. continued his advice. He told them to be fruitful<br />\nand multiply, to plant their seed<br />\non fertile soil, and to practice safe<br />\nsex because they didn't know<br />\nwhere that dirt had been. He told<br />\nthem not to drink too much vodka<br />\nor they would be screwdrivered,<br />\nand to not play with Ouija boards<br />\nbecause they are evil. He then<br />\nreminded them to adjust their<br />\nwatches because they were in a<br />\ndifferent time zone.<br />\nBut all this talking made J.R.<br />\nexhausted. Soon after he finished speaking, he was nothing<br />\nmore than fertilizer. Larry and<br />\nRay adjusted their watches and<br />\nrolled off into the sunset on Interstate 10.<br />\nThe darkness began to fade as<br />\nthe sun appeared. The two tumbling oranges found themselves in<br />\nMississippi. Ray and Larry<br />\npulled over to enjoy the sunrise,<br />\nwhen two sexy mushrooms ap-<br /><br />\npeared on the scene. The sensuous 'shrooms danced towards<br />\nthe scared oranges.<br />\nThe erotic mushrooms began<br />\ncaressing, squeezing, and peeling<br />\nthe deeply aroused oranges until<br />\nthe juices flowed. In a fit of passion, the stimulated oranges<br />\nbegan to eat out the erect<br />\nmushrooms. Feelings of this sexual nature were unknown to the<br />\ntwo virgin oranges.<br />\nSoon after the excitement<br />\nended, the satisfied shrooms left,<br />\nlaughing at the two fruits.<br />\nRecovering from this experience,<br />\nthe oranges, who had travelled so<br />\nfar, did not realize that their trip<br />\nhad just begun.<br />\nWill Ray and Larry find eternal<br />\nhappiness in Hollywood? Or will<br />\nthey roll into the GulfofMexico?<br />\nAnd do you really care?

Despite the ap-<br /><br />\nHockey Loses to TSU<br />\nby Jay Friedman<br />\nMonday, November 19\u2014<br />\nThe Hopkins Ice Hockey Team<br />\ntook on crosstown rival and<br />\nMason-Dixon league leader<br />\nTowson State in a match at Mt<br />\nPleasant Ice Arena. Towson<br />\ndefeated the second-place Jays<br />\n8-5 in a rough game marred by<br />\nmore punches than a Buster<br />\nDouglas title bout and inept officiating. The Tigers capitalized on several Hopkins miscues at<br />\ntheir own blue line to take a 2-0<br />\nlead midway in the first period.<br />\nWhen Hopkins was called for<br />\ncross-checking in the offensive<br />\nzone, it looked like the Tigers<br />\nwere going to run away with the<br />\ngame. However, the TSU advantages were nullified by a Tiger<br />\ntripping foul 16 seconds later.<br />\nHopkins then had a brief advantage and with 2 seconds remaining in the 16-second power play.<br />\nSophomore winger Jason<br />\nSprague, shooting from the left<br />\ncircle, beat the Tiger goalie with<br />\na wrist shot to the wide side to lift<br />\nthe Jays to 1-2.<br />\nTowson came back a minute<br />\nlater and converted their third<br />\ngoal off a poor defensive play at<br /><br />\nthe blue line. After the goal, a<br />\nHopkins skater checked the<br />\nscorer in the boards and the<br />\nTowson player got up swinging.<br />\nSophomore Doug Conrad was<br />\nejected from the game under the<br />\nthird-man-in rule. The penalty<br />\nleft the teams playing with only<br />\nthree skaters on the ice. With<br />\nmoments remaining in the period,<br />\nTSU added another goal after a<br />\nfake drew the defense and left a<br />\nshooter open for the crossing<br />\npass.<br />\nThe rowdy partisan crowd<br />\ncheered the Tigers to a 5-1 lead<br />\nearly in the second period on a<br />\nslap shot from the right point,<br />\nHowever, midway through the<br />\nperiod the Jays strung together<br />\nback-to-back goals, one on a tight<br />\nangle from the bottom of the left<br />\ncircle, to get within two at 3-5.<br />\nAfter the minor run, the Jays'<br />\nCanadian star, Patrick Chiasson,<br />\nwas called for a cross-check<br />\nbehind the Tiger goal. Chiasson<br />\nbeat two Towson players to the<br />\npuck, weaved between them to<br />\nset up behind the net when he saw<br />\nan onrushing Towson defender.<br />\nChiasson lifted his hands (only<br />\none on the stick) and flattened the<br />\nTiger player, igniting the Jays'<br /><br />\nfans, especially the vocal John<br />\nDarre. However, the game had<br />\nbeen rough and the Towson<br />\nskater needed to be helped up so<br />\nthe officials thought it necessary<br />\nto call the penalty. Chiasson and<br />\nHopkins' assistant captain Dave<br />\nBoxenbaum pleaded the Jays'<br />\ncase to no avail. Fortunately,<br />\nTowson once again failed to convert during the advantage and the<br />\nperiod ended 3-5.<br />\nEarly in the third period, with<br />\nHopkins once again a man short,<br />\nthe referee indicated a delayed<br />\npenalty on Towson. Hopkins'<br />\ncaptain and goalie, Dave Bowyer,<br />\nsped to the bench for an extra attacker and the Jays scored to pull<br />\nwithin 4-5 at 12:32. Just seconds<br />\nlater a Blue Jay skater was taken<br />\ndown on a break, but the incompetent officials who must<br />\nhave been watching the Monday<br />\nNight Football game did not<br />\nmake a call.<br />\nThe Jays opened it up and appeared to be building momentum<br />\nduring the third period. Unfortunately, as is prone to happen in<br />\na wide-open game, Hopkins was<br />\nbeat in the offensive zone and<br />\nTowson converted the 2-on-. 1<br />\nContinued on page 11<br /><br />\nparently slow start, Hopkins, a<br />\nschool perenially strong in Division III swimming, has the potential to improve upon last year's<br />\nsuccess at Nationals where the<br />\nmen finished eighth and the<br />\nwomen tenth.<br />\nThe reason why Hopkins winloss record now, and throughout<br />\nthe season is not necessarily the<br />\nmost important measure of the<br />\nteam's success, has to do with the<br />\ncoaching strategy of Coach<br />\nGeorge Kennedy. While he and<br />\nthe team try to win every meet,<br />\nKennedy places greater emphasis<br />\non the more important Nationals<br />\nmeet at the end of the season.<br />\nKennedy, in his sixth year at<br />\nHopkins, prepares for Nationals<br />\nby switching swimmers in and<br />\nout of various events in different<br />\ncombinations from meet to meet,<br />\nhoping to fully develop the team<br />\nso it peaks in time for Nationals.<br />\n\"I definitely would like to win<br />\nevery meet, but we're going to be<br />\nmoving people around to get<br />\nthem ready for Nationals, so I<br />\ndon't think our record actually<br />\nwill indicate how strong we are,\"<br />\nsaid Kennedy. \"That is not to say<br />\nour record doesn't matter. One of<br />\nour other goals this year is to win<br />\nthe conference, and I think we<br />\ncan do that if we have a good effort.\"<br />\nHopkins' challenge to improve<br />\nupon last year's performance may<br />\nbe more of a challenge this year<br />\nbecause of the toll taken by<br />\ngraduation. The women lost three<br />\nDivision III All-Americans while<br />\nthe men lost four. Kennedy,<br />\nhowever, feels that there is still<br />\na good deal of talent and experience around which he can<br />\nbuild.<br />\n\"I think we're fortunate<br />\nbecause, particularly in the case<br />\nof the men, we have people<br />\nwho've been to Nationals and<br /><br />\nwho know what it takes to get<br />\nthere. I also think the team attitude is really strong, and that is<br />\nreally important in swimming<br />\nbecause it is such a mental<br />\nsport,\" said Kennedy.<br />\nKennedy is hoping for a strong<br />\nseason from senior co-captains<br />\nStever Giangrandi and Scott<br />\nEric<br />\nsophomore<br />\nMay,<br />\nSteindenger, and Jay Smith, a<br />\njunior transfer from Washington<br />\nand Lee. On the women's side<br />\nKennedy expects the team to be<br />\nled by co-captains junior Betsy<br />\nBatchelor and senior Jennifer<br />\nSosnowski, as well as junior<br />\nStephanie Dengler and senior<br />\nWendy Fenstamaker. Both<br />\nteams, according to Kennedy,<br />\nshould also benefit from a solid<br />\nclass of incoming freshmen.<br />\nMen's senior co-captain, Steve<br />\nGiangrandi, a diver, is equally<br />\noptimistic about the prospects for<br />\nthis season.<br />\n\"I think we're really strong in<br />\ndiving and we've got some strong<br />\nsprinters plus we do have some<br />\nexperience,\" said Giangrandi.<br />\nAnother factor that Kennedy<br />\nhopes will have an impact upon<br />\nthis year's team is the intangible<br />\nelement of the Hopkins swimming tradition.<br />\n\"For the last twenty years the<br />\nmen have been in the top ten at<br />\nNationals and the women have<br />\nbeen in the top ten the past few<br />\nyears, as well. That's something<br />\nI don't take credit for because I<br />\nhaven't been here that long, and<br />\nthat's something that no one person can take credit for. But I think<br />\nthat says a lot for the kind of<br />\ntradition and dedication we have<br />\nwith the swimming program here<br />\nat Hopkins,\" noted Kennedy.<br />\nWhile Kennedy and the team<br />\nhope the Hopkins swimming<br />\ntradition can carry them through<br />\nto Nationals, they have never<br /><br />\nforgotten that, after all, this is<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"I think one of the greatest<br />\nthings about this team is its ability<br />\nto manage the academics with the<br />\nathletics. We've had several<br />\nacademic All-Americans, and<br />\nwe're especially proud to be<br />\nrecognized for that,\" said Kennedy. \"I think the people on the<br />\nteam deserve a lot of credit<br />\nbecause practices and meets can<br />\ntake up a lot of time, but nobody<br />\never forgets how important<br />\nacademics are.\"<br />\nThe ability to balance school<br />\nwith sports is indicative of the<br />\nteam discipline and dedication<br />\nthat Kennedy feels will carry the<br />\nteams into a strong finish at<br />\nNationals.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Varsity<br />\nMen's and Women's Swimming<br />\nteams officially opened their<br />\nseason at Shippensburg,<br />\nNovember 9,followed by a home<br />\nmeet against George Washington<br />\non November 17.

The rotating, match-up<br />\nzone, which the Jays had only one<br />\nday to practice, forced the Yellow<br />\nJackets to adjust their offense and<br />\nhit from long range. Unfortunately for Hopkins, Rochester was<br />\nable to do both of these things,<br />\nespecially the latter, hitting six of<br />\nnine three-point attempts.<br />\nOffensively, Hopkins was<br />\nunable to generate open shots<br />\nwith their screen-oriented motion<br />\noffense as they could last year.<br />\nirtually every shot was contested by Rochester, whose big<br /><br />\nfrom someone other than Enfield<br />\nif they are to compete for the<br />\nMAC Championship<br /><br />\nfrontline negated Hopkins' inside<br />\ngame, which was not very formidable to begin with.

Hampden-Sydney was<br />\nrepeatedly able to get the ball inside to their big men, especially<br />\nRussell Turner, who scored 23<br />\npoints in 24 minutes. The Tigers<br />\nwould swing the ball around the<br />\nperimeter and flash people across<br />\nthe lane, creating passing angles.<br />\nToo often Hopkins' defenders<br />\ntrailed the cutting Tigers and<br />\nwere unable to close off the passing lanes. Without a legitimate<br />\nshot-blocker patrolling the middie, Hopkins was burned for 44<br />\npoints on 59 percent shooting in<br />\nthe first .half.<br />\nThe Jays' offense was shut<br />\ndown by the Tigers, who played<br />\na tough man-to-man defense and<br />\nwere able to avoid picks and<br />\nscreens set for Enfield and Jay<br />\nGangemi. This made open shots<br />\nextremely rare, and Hopkins shot<br />\nonly 36 percent for the game.<br />\nHopkins fell behind by sixteen<br />\npoints at halftime and by 29 midway through the second half,<br />\nprompting head coach Bill Nelson<br />\nto play the freshman crop for<br />\nmost of the second half.
