In this connection, he<br />\nread a number of passages from<br />\nConrad's representative works to<br />\nillustrate the author's unique<br />\npower.<br />\n<br />\nConrad was a native of Poland,<br />\nand his mastery of English, a foreign language, is consequently all<br />\nthe greater achievement. His<br />\nfirst novels, indeed, bear evidence<br />\nof this early struggle with a new<br />\nlanguage, acquired only after<br />\nyears of residence in Poland.<br />\nThe characters of Conrad's<br />\nnovels are singularly natural persons, and each novel merely gives<br />\na series of episodes from their<br />\nlives. He rarely analyses their<br />\ncharacters, but prefers to leave<br />\nthe reader to form his own impressions. The absence of a<br />\nstrong plot is the principal weakness of Conrad's novels, and for<br />\nthis reason it is probable that<br />\nthey will not long enjoy great<br />\npopularity, was Bramble's conclusion.<br />\nAfter a short discussion of this<br />\npaper, Max Levin read the first<br />\nhalf of his paper on \"Jews and<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD.<br />\nBAND AND ORCHESTRA INSTRUMENTS<br />\nVICTROLA SPECIALISTS<br />\n<br />\nTheir Literature.\" The discourse<br />\nwas, as he explained, really only<br />\nan introduction to the second<br />\nhalf of his paper. Levin traced \u2022<br />\nthe history of the Jewish people<br />\nfrom the time of Abraham up to<br />\nthe death of Christ, and dwelt<br />\nparticularly upon the, contributions of the Hebrew writers to<br />\nthe Old Testament. The books of<br />\nthe Prophets, Levin pointed out,<br />\ncontain some of the sublimest<br />\npoetry in any literature.<br />\nAt the next meeting, May 7,<br />\nLevin will read the remainder of<br />\nhis paper, and W.

After<br />\na week of stiff contests, which included defeats at the hands of<br />\nNavy and Mt. 'Washington, the<br />\nCrimson players forced the Black<br />\nand Blue through two extra periods of ten minutes each before<br />\nthe tie was broken. Both squads<br />\nput all they had into the battle,<br />\nand the play was often very<br />\nrough.<br />\nThe first half was scoreless;<br />\n.Hopkins was shooting from far<br />\nout, and the Crimson attack<br />\ncould make no headway against<br />\ntheir opponents' defense. Only<br />\nonce did they have a real chance,<br />\nwhen Hall, the Harvard in-home,<br />\nmissed an easy chance a few feet<br />\nfrom the crease. There was nothing to stop the ball, but it wentwide, and the period ended scoreless. \u2022<br />\nEarly in the second half the<br />\nball came down the field, and<br />\nStuart\"shoveled\" it in for the first<br />\nscore. Harvard came back and<br />\ntied the count when Thompson.<br />\nregistered. From then on the<br />\nball see-sawed back and forth.<br />\nThe Harvard players were following their men closely, \u2022 and<br />\npassing was difficult.<br />\nWith the spectators shouting,<br />\n\"Play it out!\" it was decided to<br />\ncontinue for an extra period; this<br />\nwas done, but the score remained<br />\ntied at 1-all. A second .period<br />\nwas half gone when Defandorf<br />\nshot the winning goal.

The issue<br />\nwas in doubt from start to finish,<br />\nfirst Hopkins and then Swarthmore forging ahead, and at the<br />\nend the decision hinged on the<br />\n'result of the 220-yard dash. In<br />\nthis event, the Hopkins supporters were cheered by seeing Van<br />\nNess jump into what seemed a<br />\ncommanding lead at the start,<br />\nbut their hopes crumbled when<br />\nwithin 20 yards of the tape the<br />\nBlack and Blue runner faltered,<br />\nand Spackman, of Swarthmore,<br />\nsqueezed in a winner. This gave<br />\nSwarthmore 58 points to Hopkins' 54.<br />\nA number of thincrs seemed to<br />\nconspire to prevent the<br />\n6 Homewood<br />\nboys from garnering the laurels:<br />\nHad three men run and 'third<br />\nplaces counted, had the \"blacklist\" been decorated with the<br />\nnames of fewer track stars, had<br />\nthe field men shown up but a little stronger, the outcome would<br />\nProbably have been more satisfying to Hopkins' rooters.<br />\nThe work of Thompson in winning the 440 and the 220 hurdles<br />\nand placing second in the 100<br />\nwas an outstanding feature. All<br />\nthree of these races were run in<br />\nfine time, and his performance<br />\nin each was up to that expected<br />\nof him.

In this connection, he<br />\nread a number of passages from<br />\nConrad's representative works to<br />\nillustrate the author's unique<br />\npower.<br /><br />\nConrad was a native of Poland,<br />\nand his mastery of English, a foreign language, is consequently all<br />\nthe greater achievement. His<br />\nfirst novels, indeed, bear evidence<br />\nof this early struggle with a new<br />\nlanguage, acquired only after<br />\nyears of residence in Poland.<br />\nThe characters of Conrad's<br />\nnovels are singularly natural persons, and each novel merely gives<br />\na series of episodes from their<br />\nlives. He rarely analyses their<br />\ncharacters, but prefers to leave<br />\nthe reader to form his own impressions. The absence of a<br />\nstrong plot is the principal weakness of Conrad's novels, and for<br />\nthis reason it is probable that<br />\nthey will not long enjoy great<br />\npopularity, was Bramble's conclusion.<br />\nAfter a short discussion of this<br />\npaper, Max Levin read the first<br />\nhalf of his paper on \"Jews and<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD.<br />\nBAND AND ORCHESTRA INSTRUMENTS<br />\nVICTROLA SPECIALISTS<br /><br />\nTheir Literature.\" The discourse<br />\nwas, as he explained, really only<br />\nan introduction to the second<br />\nhalf of his paper. Levin traced \u2022<br />\nthe history of the Jewish people<br />\nfrom the time of Abraham up to<br />\nthe death of Christ, and dwelt<br />\nparticularly upon the, contributions of the Hebrew writers to<br />\nthe Old Testament. The books of<br />\nthe Prophets, Levin pointed out,<br />\ncontain some of the sublimest<br />\npoetry in any literature.<br />\nAt the next meeting, May 7,<br />\nLevin will read the remainder of<br />\nhis paper, and W. Wiscott will<br />\npresent a paper on \"Andreyeff<br />\nand Russian Literature.\" President Goetz announced that an<br />\neffort was being made to secure<br />\nAlfred Noyes and Vachel Lindsay<br />\nto speak before the club.<br /><br />\n301<br /><br />\nN.
