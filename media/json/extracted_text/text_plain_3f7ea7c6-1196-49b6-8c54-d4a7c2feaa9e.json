(It<br />\nis to be remembered that the Playshop<br />\nIs composed of amateurs who desire<br />\nand receive practice in acting and direction, and production of plays, and<br />\nthat at each meeting another group<br />\nOf members takes its turn upon the<br />\nstage.)

This performance, from all<br />\nappearances, is regarded by modern<br />\nBaltimoreans as a social event. The advance ticket sale shows that many<br />\ntheatre parties are being planned for<br />\nthe evening of November 18, and also<br />\nthat many Hopkins students are taking this opportunity to see a fine play<br />\nacted by America's only repertory<br />\ncompany, Jasper Deeter's Hedgerow<br />\nPlayers. Mr. Deeter is the director who<br />\ntrained, among others, John Beale,<br />\nClaudette Colbert, Ann Harding and<br />\nLibby Holman. Consequently Baltimore and Hopkins audiences may justly expect a superb show at the Auditorium Theatre on next Wednesday<br />\nevening. '<br />\nAt the meeting, a further announcement was that of a record number of<br />\nseason subscribers to the Playshop's<br />\nPerformances. This year, nearly twohundred theatre-lovers have subscribed to date, showing the definite<br />\ngrowth in popularity of the Little<br />\nTheatre Movement.

From<br />\nthese announcnients it was evident<br />\nthat the year is to be varied and interesting.<br />\nFirst in the order of business came<br />\nthe one-act play, this time a light<br />\ncomedy with an all-girl cast, skillfully presented. According to tradition,<br />\nthe play was closely criticized by the<br />\naudience of Playshoppers -composed<br />\nfor the evening of about fifty men<br />\nand women, from the Hopkins campus<br />\nand from the city of Baltimore. (It<br />\nis to be remembered that the Playshop<br />\nIs composed of amateurs who desire<br />\nand receive practice in acting and direction, and production of plays, and<br />\nthat at each meeting another group<br />\nOf members takes its turn upon the<br />\nstage.) In future meetings this year,<br />\nas was planned by President Fusslebaugh, there will be presented similarly for, experience, Eugene O'Neill's<br />\nwartime play In the Zone, to be directed by Vannort Jackson, and a modern<br />\nChinese melodrama.<br />\nHedgerow Players Popular<br />\nDr. Fagin, direotor of the Playshop,<br />\nreported very favorably on the reception which Baltimore is giving to the<br />\nHedgerow Players, whose performance<br />\nof Bernard Shaw's comedy Getting<br />\nMarried is being sponsored by the<br />\nPlayshop. This performance, from all<br />\nappearances, is regarded by modern<br />\nBaltimoreans as a social event. The advance ticket sale shows that many<br />\ntheatre parties are being planned for<br />\nthe evening of November 18, and also<br />\nthat many Hopkins students are taking this opportunity to see a fine play<br />\nacted by America's only repertory<br />\ncompany, Jasper Deeter's Hedgerow<br />\nPlayers. Mr. Deeter is the director who<br />\ntrained, among others, John Beale,<br />\nClaudette Colbert, Ann Harding and<br />\nLibby Holman. Consequently Baltimore and Hopkins audiences may justly expect a superb show at the Auditorium Theatre on next Wednesday<br />\nevening.
