The<br />\nboys have been working hard at<br />\nimproving their strokes, and have<br />\nbeen trying to get that extra zip<br />\nin their serves.<br />\nWith the addition of former<br />\nfrosh star Ira Anderson to the<br />\nteam, the competition has become<br />\ntougher for singles berths. Senior<br />\nEd Habermann is, at present, the<br />\nnumber one man on the squad,<br />\nwith junior Al Greenberg in the<br />\n<br />\nnumber two slot. In a practice<br />\nmatch last Tuesday, they split sets,<br />\nGreenberg winning the opener, 6-1,<br />\nand Habermann taking the final,<br />\n6-3. Right behind Habermann and<br />\nGreenberg is Ron Creamer, who<br />\nhas impressed Coach Steinmann<br />\nwith his early season play. Sophomore Dan Switky played in the<br />\nnumber four spot in the American<br />\nUniversity match, and, although he<br />\nwas beaten in a tough three set<br />\nmatch, he showed Steinmann some<br />\ngood form and powerful strokes.<br />\nSwitky has been working all<br />\nweek to work out some of the weak<br />\nshots in his game, and as the JHU<br />\nmentor said, \"With a little confidence, Danny could be one of the<br />\nbetter players in the conference.\"<br />\nAnother player who has impressed Steinmann with his play'<br />\nso far this season is soph Herb<br />\nButler. Butler plays \"the good,<br />\n'<br />\nsteady, consistent type of tennis,'<br />\nand he \"rarely makes a bad shot.\"<br />\nTwo other sophomores have<br />\nshown Steinmann that they can<br />\nplay a good game of tennis. Joe<br />\nPedorella and Claude Barfield, who<br />\nteamed up to play third doubles<br />\nagainst American U., have \"im\"<br />\nproved quite a bit from last year'<br />\nand have bright futures in Hopkins tennis, according to the Jay'<br />\ncoach.

The<br />\nboys have been working hard at<br />\nimproving their strokes, and have<br />\nbeen trying to get that extra zip<br />\nin their serves.<br />\nWith the addition of former<br />\nfrosh star Ira Anderson to the<br />\nteam, the competition has become<br />\ntougher for singles berths. Senior<br />\nEd Habermann is, at present, the<br />\nnumber one man on the squad,<br />\nwith junior Al Greenberg in the<br /><br />\nnumber two slot. In a practice<br />\nmatch last Tuesday, they split sets,<br />\nGreenberg winning the opener, 6-1,<br />\nand Habermann taking the final,<br />\n6-3. Right behind Habermann and<br />\nGreenberg is Ron Creamer, who<br />\nhas impressed Coach Steinmann<br />\nwith his early season play. Sophomore Dan Switky played in the<br />\nnumber four spot in the American<br />\nUniversity match, and, although he<br />\nwas beaten in a tough three set<br />\nmatch, he showed Steinmann some<br />\ngood form and powerful strokes.<br />\nSwitky has been working all<br />\nweek to work out some of the weak<br />\nshots in his game, and as the JHU<br />\nmentor said, \"With a little confidence, Danny could be one of the<br />\nbetter players in the conference.\"<br />\nAnother player who has impressed Steinmann with his play'<br />\nso far this season is soph Herb<br />\nButler. Butler plays \"the good,<br />\n'<br />\nsteady, consistent type of tennis,'<br />\nand he \"rarely makes a bad shot.\"<br />\nTwo other sophomores have<br />\nshown Steinmann that they can<br />\nplay a good game of tennis.
