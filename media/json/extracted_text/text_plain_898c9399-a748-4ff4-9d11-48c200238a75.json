For there<br />\nis no sorrier example of failure in Hull's \"Good Neighbor\" policy than his treatment of Cardenas' unhappy<br />\ncountry.<br />\nCertain American publicists, their minds reportedly<br />\nstimulated by the Standard Oil Corporation, have done<br />\nmuch to spread the devil theory of Mexico.

Yet, Mr. Hull has<br />\nbeen conspicuous for the choleric quality of his protests.<br />\nThere is an age-old maxim that no Mexican president<br />\never lasts long without the support of these United<br />\nStates.
