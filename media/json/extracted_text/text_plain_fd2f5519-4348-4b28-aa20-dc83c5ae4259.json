Bowie expressed<br />\noptimism that the merger would<br />\nbest serve the financial interests<br />\nof each institution. \"We are<br />\nconvinced that we can do<br />\nsignificant things to improve<br />\ntheir financial situation.\"<br />\nProvide financial counseling<br />\nHopkins officials have publicly<br />\nadvocated that Peabody's present<br />\nfinancial straits are reparable and<br />\nthat they exist in large part<br />\nbecause of that school's inability<br />\nto exploit all available financial<br />\nresources, such as funds from the<br />\nfederal government. President<br />\nMuller explained the University's<br />\n<br />\nposition: \"They (Peabody) don't<br />\nhave the staff to apply for the<br />\nmoney. We (Hopkins) can help<br />\nthem here. We think that we can<br />\nalso provide some financial<br />\ncounseling to them.\" Muller,<br />\nalong with other Hopkins<br />\nadministrators, mentioned the<br />\nperceived ability of Hopkins to<br />\nprovide administrative services to<br />\nPeabody at a lower price then<br />\nthey now pay and stimulate<br />\nfund-raising and publicity efforts.<br />\nWhile Hopkins has been<br />\ncareful not to criticize any of the \u2022<br />\nPeabody officials on the basis of poor management, they have<br />\ninstead taken the position that it<br />\nis the relatively small size of<br />\nPeabody which has caused many<br />\nof their money worries. From a<br />\nhigh of $6 million in 1972, the<br />\nendowment there has plummeted<br />\nto a current low of $3.5 million.<br />\nHopkins endowment exceeds<br />\n$150 million.<br />\nGarland Hall spokesmen do<br />\nnot feel that the Peabody<br />\ncritical of<br />\nis<br />\ncommunity<br />\nHopkins coming to the aid of<br />\nthat struggling school. Said<br />\nBowie, \"I don't think they resent<br />\nus coming in.\" He continued,<br />\n\"They have some obvious<br />\nproblems which we think we<br />\ncould arrange to help. I don't<br />\nthink their financial management<br />\nis in shambles. They have a good<br />\nbusiness manager and he's doing<br />\na damn good job.\"<br />\nOne of the major obstacles<br />\nwhich the Peabody Institute has<br />\nencountered in attempting to<br />\nrescue itself from the economic<br />\nexigencies it has encountered<br />\nover the last several years has<br />\nbeen its poor credit rating. Muller<br />\ncommented, \"Their credit is to<br />\nsome degree questionable. They<br />\nwill have to borrow to get<br />\nthemselves righted financially.<br />\nWe can help them to arrange for<br />\nthe kind of credit they need.\"<br />\n<br />\n2nd edition-completely<br />\nrevised and expanded<br />\n<br />\nSciences George Owen echoes the<br />\nsentiment of others in saying:<br />\n\"There may be two or three<br />\nrelatively good conservatories in<br />\nthis country. Muller has taken an<br />\naltruistic position that Hopkins<br />\nshould provide shelter for the<br />\nPeabody and allow them to<br />\ncontinue their independence. I<br />\nhope that Hopkins is displaying<br />\nsome idealism here, and is going<br />\nforward for aesthetic reasons as<br />\nwell.\" It has been learned<br />\nrecently that one tenet of the<br />\naffiliation accord will allow<br />\nHopkins students to enroll in<br />\ncourses at the Peabody which<br />\nthey qualify for, and permit<br />\nPeabody students to do likewise<br />\nat Hopkins. Owen lauded that<br />\nproposal, explaining that many<br />\nHopkins students have long<br />\nexpressed the desire to take<br />\ncourses at the Peabody. However,<br />\nthe Dean admitted that most of<br />\nthe benefits in this area of<br />\ncooperation will probably accrue<br />\nto Peabody students taking<br />\nadvantage of Hopkins renowned<br />\narts and sciences.<br />\nIt has been difficult to<br />\ndetermine Peabody's position on<br />\nthe affiliation. Other than the<br />\ncomments given by trustees<br />\nthere, the institution has<br />\nmaintained a tight-linned posture<br />\non the affiliation. When peabody<br />\nDirector Richard Goldman was<br />\nasked to talk a reporter on the<br />\naffiliation proposal he declined,<br />\ntelling his secretary to relay the<br />\nmessage: \"There is nothing new<br />\nto report.\" Other Peabody<br />\nofficials have been unavailable<br />\nfor comment.<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\n\u2014 Diane Shugart<br />\n<br />\n\"Universal in appeal...<br />\nThe information imparted is vital<br />\nand simply expressed.\"<br />\n\u2014 Carol Kleiman, Chicago Tribune<br />\n<br />\n\"One of those rare<br />\nbooks that truly<br />\nmakes a difference.\"<br />\n\u2014 Genevieve Stuttaford,<br />\nSaturday Review<br />\n\u2022 Full Selection of the Woman<br />\nToday Book Club \u2022 Alternate<br />\nSelection of the Quality Paperback<br />\nBook Service \u2022 Alternate Selection of the Psychology Today<br />\n\u2022 Touchstone paperBoo',<br />\nback $4.95, cloth $12.95<br />\n<br />\nHENRY KISSINGER NEEDS YOU!!<br />\nMr. Gerald Monroe, Deputy Examiner for the Foreign<br />\nService, will visit the Johns Hopkins' Placement<br />\nBureau on Wednesday, October 20th.

Vice-president for Business Management Robert<br />\nBowie expresses the fear that the med school tuition hike<br />\ncould well serve to inhibit cross-fertilization among the<br />\ndivisions of the University. True, it is not clear at this point if<br />\nstudents from other divisions will be allowed to continue to<br />\ntake courses at the med school without falling prey to<br />\nsimilarly larger fees. But even if tuition remains at the lower<br />\nrate for cross-over students, ill-feelings could well be the<br />\nproduct of some students paying a higher rate for the same<br />\ninstruction.<br />\nDespite the University's claim that tuition at the School of<br />\nMedicine has \"inappropriately\" been held down in the past,<br />\nit appears that advantage is being taken of med students who,<br />\nwith future employment virtually assured, are not likely to<br />\nbe too vociferous in their complaints.

We felt no obligation<br />\nHanh Nguyen<br />\nto invite speakers whose main<br />\npurpose would be to guarantee a<br />\nlarge audience. This was one of<br />\nour first decisions and we take<br />\nresponsibiliyt for it.

This is perhaps<br />\nwhy we were accused of being<br />\n\"too cerebral\". If so, then we<br />\nplead guilty. As to the relevance<br />\nof this approach, as was<br />\nmentioned in the News-Letter<br />\narticle on Michael Harrington, To the Editor:<br />\nI disagree with the ideas<br />\nThe Other America was the<br />\nstimulus for the Kennedy presented by Janet Bouton (\"Is<br />\npoverty program.

The suit stems from a<br />\nseries of boycotts organized<br />\nagainst white merchants in<br />\nClaiborne County during 1966,<br />\nand, later, in 1969.<br />\nTen days ago, Federal Judge<br />\nOr ma R. Smith issued a<br />\ntemporary restraining order to<br />\nprevent Claiborne County<br />\nofficials from enforcing the<br />\njudgement. The NAACP has been<br />\ngiven at least until October 21 to<br />\nraise the $1.6 million required<br />\nfor appeal of the lower court<br />\ndecision. It is expected that<br />\nFederal officials will be<br />\nextremely sympathetic to the<br />\ncivil rights group.<br />\nThe Association has so far<br />\nraised almost $500,000 in<br />\ncontributions, much of it from<br />\nblack churches. Another half<br />\nmillion dollars has been loaned to<br />\nthe NAACP.

Haynes had his<br />\nway, the Association would be<br />\npaying $1.2 million to several<br />\nwhite merchants ,from the town<br />\nof Port Gibson. In his eighty-four<br />\npage opinion, Judge Haynes<br />\nfound that 134 defendants,(with<br />\nthe NAACP heading the list),<br />\n\"combined and colluded in civil<br />\nconspiracy, engaged in a<br />\nsecondary boycott against<br />\ncomplainants, illegaly created a<br />\nmonopoly, unlawfully interfered<br />\nwith<br />\nThe business relations of<br />\nthe complainants and unlawfully<br />\n<br />\nJudge Haynes flatly denies<br />\nany possibility of the merchants<br />\naiding the blacks in their cause.<br />\nCan this be true?

If true,<br />\nthen the noble ends of the blacks<br />\ncould not excuse such immoral<br />\nmeans. The decision written by<br />\nJudge Haynes reveals no<br />\ntestimony or evidence which<br />\nwithout question shows an<br />\n<br />\nreasonable greivance. . .over<br />\n<br />\namong its directors or<br />\nstockholders or a conspiracy of<br />\nits agents with other persons or<br />\ncorporations.\" However, the law<br />\nmakes an exception: \"It is held,<br />\nthough, that a corporation<br />\ncannot be a party to a conspiracy<br />\nconsisting of the corporation and<br />\nthe persons engaged in the<br />\nmanagement, direction, and<br />\ncontrol of the corporate affairs,<br />\nwhere the individuals are acting<br />\nonly for the corporation and not<br />\nfor any personal purpose of their<br />\nown...\"<br />\nSince the officers of the<br />\nNAACP are black, and they were<br />\nexerting themselves for all black<br />\npeople, the element of \"personal<br />\npurpose\" existed. It is assumed<br />\nthat it will be difficult in the<br />\nstate of Mississippi to pin a<br />\nsimilar rap on any other business<br />\ncorporation. Profits are not to be<br />\nregarded as personal interest.<br />\nThis whole case reflects a wide<br />\ndouble standard\u2014one for whites,<br />\nand one for prams.<br />\nThere now seems little doubt<br />\nthat the NAACP will find the<br />\nmoney to appeal its case; that the<br />\nruling will be overturned; and the<br />\nAssociation will get back to the<br />\nbusiness of securing freedom for<br />\n<br />\norganized attempt by any group<br />\n<br />\nall Americans.

The Civil Rights Act<br />\nof 1964 endowed such an<br />\nundertaking with legal validity.<br />\nDemands included not only the<br />\nwell known cries for<br />\ndesegregation of public jobs and<br />\nfacilities, but an end to a social<br />\norder which consciously<br />\nmaintained the second class<br />\nstatus of the black person.<br />\nTake for example these four<br />\nrequests in the letter sent by<br />\nblack leaders to the county<br />\nofficials: 1) \"Crossing guards are<br />\nto be posted at all schools, not<br />\njust white schools,\" 2)\"All snack<br />\nbars should be removed from<br />\nclassrooms,\" 3) \"Salesmen<br />\n<br />\nWhen<br />\nthe merchants refused to help,<br />\nthe blacks decided to give them a<br />\ntaste of their own medicine: \"If<br />\nyou won't help us, we won't help<br />\nyou.\"<br />\nTo facilitate an effective<br />\nboycott, the black community<br />\ncreated a corporation, Our Mart,<br />\nInc. \"All of the stock was owned<br />\nby black people, and all of its<br />\nofficers were black. The black<br />\ncitizens of Claiborne County<br />\nwere urged to do their trading<br />\nwith\" the new store.<br />\nJudge Haynes finds this piece<br />\nof evidence to be very important.<br />\nIt is, in his mind, a definite<br />\nindication of conspiracy. Others<br />\nhave called it free enterprise.<br />\nIn 1968, Section 97-23-85 of<br />\nthe Mississippi State Code was<br />\nenacted. This law, the effort of<br />\nthe Port Gibson representative to<br />\nthe state legislature, specifically<br />\nprohibited the type of boycotts<br />\nthe NAACP had engaged in. Prior<br />\nto this date, no state law existed<br />\nto cover this particular instance.<br />\nThe Section reads in part, \"If<br />\ntwo or more persons conspire to<br />\nprevent another person or<br />\npersons from trading or doing<br />\nbusiness with any merchant. .<br />\n.and as a result of said conspiracy<br />\nsaid persons induce or encourage<br />\nany individual or individuals to<br />\ncease doing business with any<br />\nmerchant. . .and when such<br />\nconspiracy is formed and<br />\neffectuated because of a<br />\n<br />\nperson shall be guilty or tile<br />\ncrime of unlawful restraint of<br />\n<br />\ntrade. . .and. . .shall be liable in<br />\ncivil action for any damages<br />\n<br />\nsuffered by said merchant...\"<br />\nThe merchants did not seem to<br />\nhave any trouble effecting legal<br />\nchange when it was for their<br />\nbenefit. -- Did they?<br />\nMore<br />\n<br />\nshould be barred from entering<br />\nclassrooms and interrupting<br />\nclasses,\" and, 4) \"The teachers'<br />\nlounge should be restored for<br />\nteachers use rather than a<br />\ncentralized area for selling.\"<br />\nChange<br />\nThe NAACP knew that white<br />\nbusiness leaders, although<br />\ntechnically without control over<br />\nthe government, could institute<br />\nchange if they so desired.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1969, the boycotts were<br />\nresumed after the shooting of a<br />\nyoung black male. This time, the<br />\nmerchants had legal ammunition<br />\nto defend themselves with.<br />\nThe defendants in this case<br />\ncontended that Section 97-23-85<br />\nwas unconstitutional under the<br />\nFirst and Fourteenth<br />\nAmendments. Judge Haynes<br />\nreplied, \"This contention is<br />\nwithout merit, for the reason<br />\nthat conduct and communication<br />\nwhich are illegal are not<br />\nprotected by the constitutional<br />\nprovisions relating to freedom of<br />\n<br />\n97-23-85 over Genesis 4:9?<br />\n<br />\nspeech.\"<br />\nIt is frightening to read a<br />\n<br />\naumission, useu a great ue\u2018u<br />\n<br />\nUI<br />\n<br />\ncircumstantial evidence to<br />\nconclude that the NAACP<br />\nconducted a campaign of terror<br />\nto insure all black citizens<br />\ncooperated with the boycott.<br />\n<br />\nThis added much weight to the<br />\nconspiracy charge. The<br />\ncomplainants, however, never<br />\ninstituted criminal proceedings<br />\nagainst the defendants. Such a<br />\nsituation would require a jury<br />\ntrial in which case, circumstantial<br />\nevidence would be insufficient<br />\nfor a conviction. A civil suit<br />\naccording to Mississippi law does<br />\nnot need a jury trial.<br />\nFinally, how is it that the<br />\nNAACP, a corporation, is held<br />\nresponsible for the acts of<br />\nindividuals?

Since it was a tie, the judges decided that the Macksey team won, on the basis of Neatness (as was specified),<br />\nand also due to the insane amount of information they provided.

Bowie expressed<br />\noptimism that the merger would<br />\nbest serve the financial interests<br />\nof each institution. \"We are<br />\nconvinced that we can do<br />\nsignificant things to improve<br />\ntheir financial situation.\"<br />\nProvide financial counseling<br />\nHopkins officials have publicly<br />\nadvocated that Peabody's present<br />\nfinancial straits are reparable and<br />\nthat they exist in large part<br />\nbecause of that school's inability<br />\nto exploit all available financial<br />\nresources, such as funds from the<br />\nfederal government. President<br />\nMuller explained the University's<br /><br />\nposition: \"They (Peabody) don't<br />\nhave the staff to apply for the<br />\nmoney. We (Hopkins) can help<br />\nthem here. We think that we can<br />\nalso provide some financial<br />\ncounseling to them.\" Muller,<br />\nalong with other Hopkins<br />\nadministrators, mentioned the<br />\nperceived ability of Hopkins to<br />\nprovide administrative services to<br />\nPeabody at a lower price then<br />\nthey now pay and stimulate<br />\nfund-raising and publicity efforts.<br />\nWhile Hopkins has been<br />\ncareful not to criticize any of the \u2022<br />\nPeabody officials on the basis of poor management, they have<br />\ninstead taken the position that it<br />\nis the relatively small size of<br />\nPeabody which has caused many<br />\nof their money worries.

Muller<br />\ncommented, \"Their credit is to<br />\nsome degree questionable.

I<br />\nhope that Hopkins is displaying<br />\nsome idealism here, and is going<br />\nforward for aesthetic reasons as<br />\nwell.\" It has been learned<br />\nrecently that one tenet of the<br />\naffiliation accord will allow<br />\nHopkins students to enroll in<br />\ncourses at the Peabody which<br />\nthey qualify for, and permit<br />\nPeabody students to do likewise<br />\nat Hopkins. Owen lauded that<br />\nproposal, explaining that many<br />\nHopkins students have long<br />\nexpressed the desire to take<br />\ncourses at the Peabody. However,<br />\nthe Dean admitted that most of<br />\nthe benefits in this area of<br />\ncooperation will probably accrue<br />\nto Peabody students taking<br />\nadvantage of Hopkins renowned<br />\narts and sciences.<br />\nIt has been difficult to<br />\ndetermine Peabody's position on<br />\nthe affiliation.

True, it is not clear at this point if<br />\nstudents from other divisions will be allowed to continue to<br />\ntake courses at the med school without falling prey to<br />\nsimilarly larger fees.

The suit stems from a<br />\nseries of boycotts organized<br />\nagainst white merchants in<br />\nClaiborne County during 1966,<br />\nand, later, in 1969.<br />\nTen days ago, Federal Judge<br />\nOr ma R. Smith issued a<br />\ntemporary restraining order to<br />\nprevent Claiborne County<br />\nofficials from enforcing the<br />\njudgement. The NAACP has been<br />\ngiven at least until October 21 to<br />\nraise the $1.6 million required<br />\nfor appeal of the lower court<br />\ndecision. It is expected that<br />\nFederal officials will be<br />\nextremely sympathetic to the<br />\ncivil rights group.<br />\nThe Association has so far<br />\nraised almost $500,000 in<br />\ncontributions, much of it from<br />\nblack churches.

Haynes had his<br />\nway, the Association would be<br />\npaying $1.2 million to several<br />\nwhite merchants ,from the town<br />\nof Port Gibson. In his eighty-four<br />\npage opinion, Judge Haynes<br />\nfound that 134 defendants,(with<br />\nthe NAACP heading the list),<br />\n\"combined and colluded in civil<br />\nconspiracy, engaged in a<br />\nsecondary boycott against<br />\ncomplainants, illegaly created a<br />\nmonopoly, unlawfully interfered<br />\nwith<br />\nThe business relations of<br />\nthe complainants and unlawfully<br /><br />\nJudge Haynes flatly denies<br />\nany possibility of the merchants<br />\naiding the blacks in their cause.<br />\nCan this be true?

If true,<br />\nthen the noble ends of the blacks<br />\ncould not excuse such immoral<br />\nmeans. The decision written by<br />\nJudge Haynes reveals no<br />\ntestimony or evidence which<br />\nwithout question shows an<br /><br />\nreasonable greivance. . .over<br /><br />\namong its directors or<br />\nstockholders or a conspiracy of<br />\nits agents with other persons or<br />\ncorporations.\" However, the law<br />\nmakes an exception: \"It is held,<br />\nthough, that a corporation<br />\ncannot be a party to a conspiracy<br />\nconsisting of the corporation and<br />\nthe persons engaged in the<br />\nmanagement, direction, and<br />\ncontrol of the corporate affairs,<br />\nwhere the individuals are acting<br />\nonly for the corporation and not<br />\nfor any personal purpose of their<br />\nown...\"<br />\nSince the officers of the<br />\nNAACP are black, and they were<br />\nexerting themselves for all black<br />\npeople, the element of \"personal<br />\npurpose\" existed. It is assumed<br />\nthat it will be difficult in the<br />\nstate of Mississippi to pin a<br />\nsimilar rap on any other business<br />\ncorporation. Profits are not to be<br />\nregarded as personal interest.<br />\nThis whole case reflects a wide<br />\ndouble standard\u2014one for whites,<br />\nand one for prams.<br />\nThere now seems little doubt<br />\nthat the NAACP will find the<br />\nmoney to appeal its case; that the<br />\nruling will be overturned; and the<br />\nAssociation will get back to the<br />\nbusiness of securing freedom for<br /><br />\norganized attempt by any group<br /><br />\nall Americans. That's the likely<br /><br />\nto gain their way through violent<br /><br />\nscenaic,<br /><br />\nwhich the said merchant. . .has<br /><br />\nzr<br />\ntook the judge three years to get<br />\nit all down on paper.<br />\nThat's a legal moutfilla and<br /><br />\nDemands<br />\nThis whole business started<br />\nbecause the Claiborne County<br />\nchapter of the NAACP demanded<br />\na better quality of life for the<br />\nblack citizens of that<br />\ncommunity. The Civil Rights Act<br />\nof 1964 endowed such an<br />\nundertaking with legal validity.<br />\nDemands included not only the<br />\nwell known cries for<br />\ndesegregation of public jobs and<br />\nfacilities, but an end to a social<br />\norder which consciously<br />\nmaintained the second class<br />\nstatus of the black person.<br />\nTake for example these four<br />\nrequests in the letter sent by<br />\nblack leaders to the county<br />\nofficials: 1) \"Crossing guards are<br />\nto be posted at all schools, not<br />\njust white schools,\" 2)\"All snack<br />\nbars should be removed from<br />\nclassrooms,\" 3) \"Salesmen<br /><br />\nWhen<br />\nthe merchants refused to help,<br />\nthe blacks decided to give them a<br />\ntaste of their own medicine: \"If<br />\nyou won't help us, we won't help<br />\nyou.\"<br />\nTo facilitate an effective<br />\nboycott, the black community<br />\ncreated a corporation, Our Mart,<br />\nInc. \"All of the stock was owned<br />\nby black people, and all of its<br />\nofficers were black. The black<br />\ncitizens of Claiborne County<br />\nwere urged to do their trading<br />\nwith\" the new store.<br />\nJudge Haynes finds this piece<br />\nof evidence to be very important.<br />\nIt is, in his mind, a definite<br />\nindication of conspiracy. Others<br />\nhave called it free enterprise.<br />\nIn 1968, Section 97-23-85 of<br />\nthe Mississippi State Code was<br />\nenacted. This law, the effort of<br />\nthe Port Gibson representative to<br />\nthe state legislature, specifically<br />\nprohibited the type of boycotts<br />\nthe NAACP had engaged in. Prior<br />\nto this date, no state law existed<br />\nto cover this particular instance.<br />\nThe Section reads in part, \"If<br />\ntwo or more persons conspire to<br />\nprevent another person or<br />\npersons from trading or doing<br />\nbusiness with any merchant. .<br />\n.and as a result of said conspiracy<br />\nsaid persons induce or encourage<br />\nany individual or individuals to<br />\ncease doing business with any<br />\nmerchant. . .and when such<br />\nconspiracy is formed and<br />\neffectuated because of a<br /><br />\nperson shall be guilty or tile<br />\ncrime of unlawful restraint of<br /><br />\ntrade. . .and. . .shall be liable in<br />\ncivil action for any damages<br /><br />\nsuffered by said merchant...\"<br />\nThe merchants did not seem to<br />\nhave any trouble effecting legal<br />\nchange when it was for their<br />\nbenefit. -- Did they?<br />\nMore<br /><br />\nshould be barred from entering<br />\nclassrooms and interrupting<br />\nclasses,\" and, 4) \"The teachers'<br />\nlounge should be restored for<br />\nteachers use rather than a<br />\ncentralized area for selling.\"<br />\nChange<br />\nThe NAACP knew that white<br />\nbusiness leaders, although<br />\ntechnically without control over<br />\nthe government, could institute<br />\nchange if they so desired.<br /><br />\nIn 1969, the boycotts were<br />\nresumed after the shooting of a<br />\nyoung black male. This time, the<br />\nmerchants had legal ammunition<br />\nto defend themselves with.<br />\nThe defendants in this case<br />\ncontended that Section 97-23-85<br />\nwas unconstitutional under the<br />\nFirst and Fourteenth<br />\nAmendments. Judge Haynes<br />\nreplied, \"This contention is<br />\nwithout merit, for the reason<br />\nthat conduct and communication<br />\nwhich are illegal are not<br />\nprotected by the constitutional<br />\nprovisions relating to freedom of<br /><br />\n97-23-85 over Genesis 4:9?<br /><br />\nspeech.\"<br />\nIt is frightening to read a<br /><br />\naumission, useu a great ue\u2018u<br /><br />\nUI<br /><br />\ncircumstantial evidence to<br />\nconclude that the NAACP<br />\nconducted a campaign of terror<br />\nto insure all black citizens<br />\ncooperated with the boycott.<br /><br />\nThis added much weight to the<br />\nconspiracy charge. The<br />\ncomplainants, however, never<br />\ninstituted criminal proceedings<br />\nagainst the defendants. Such a<br />\nsituation would require a jury<br />\ntrial in which case, circumstantial<br />\nevidence would be insufficient<br />\nfor a conviction.

Now on the<br />\nshort end of a 14-0 count, the<br />\nhome team moved from their<br />\nown thirty-nine to a first down at<br />\nthe Sea Gull twenty-three.<br />\nUnfortunately, the offense<br />\nchose this moment to move into<br />\nreverse. A penalty and several<br />\nquarterback sacks brought about<br />\na third and twenty-seven,<br />\nwhereupon the drive promptly<br />\nfizzled.<br /><br />\nAny hopes of a possible<br />\nvictory were squelched on the<br />\nopening kick-off of the second<br />\nhalf. Gathering in the ball at his<br />\nown two yard line, the Salisbury<br />\nkick returner moved untouched<br />\ndown the left sideline for<br />\nninety-eight yards and a<br />\ntouchdown. The successful extra<br />\npoint conversion made the score<br />\n21-0 and set the stage for the<br />\neventual rout.<br /><br />\n''If<br />\n\"If we eliminated our<br />\nmistakes, it would have been a<br />\nmuch better game,\" the Coach<br />\ncommented. \"I don't know if we<br />\nwould have won, but it would<br />\nhave been a better game.\"<br />\n\"The mistakes were a result of<br />\nour inexperience,\" the Blue Jay<br />\nmentor continued. \"We were well<br />\nprepared going into the game,<br />\nz<br />\nbut we made some early errors<br />\nco and our people got down.<br />\n``The mistakes were<br />\ncorrec<br />\ntable ones, but we'll have<br />\n:<br />\nto concentrate to eliminate<br />\nthem\"<br />\nDespite the overall team result,<br />\n-sz<br />\nthe Coach cited the excellent<br />\nplay of several of his players.<br />\nIncluded in this group were<br />\ndefensive tackles Willie Oliver<br />\nand Ned Sacha, linebacker Dave<br />\nBudzik and center Rick Law.<br />\nAnd, as if the team hadn't<br />\nalready had its share of injuries,<br />\ntri-captain Mike Rhodey was lost<br />\nfor the year with a shoulder<br />\ninjury. Rhodey was a two-way<br />\nstarter (defensive safety and<br />\noffensive tight end) and will be<br />\nsorely missed.<br />\nThe team (now 1-3) travels to<br />\nour nation's capitol this weekend<br />\nto face the Georgetown Hoyas.<br /><br />\nSoccer squad drops another one<br />\nThe Blue Jay soccer squad's<br />\nchances for a MAC divisional<br />\nchampionship this season<br />\nreceived a severe jolt as they<br />\ndropped a 1-0 heartbreaker to<br />\nSwarthmore College this past<br />\nSaturday at Homewood.<br />\nForward Torn Gilbert put a<br />\nshot past JHU goalie Ken Suesse<br />\nwith less than two minutes<br />\nremaining in the game to break a<br />\nscoreless tie.<br />\nThe game renresented a battle<br />\nbetween the two undefeated<br />\nteams of the league in order to<br />\ndecide which would take clear<br />\npossession of the top spot. As<br />\nexpected, both teams played<br />\nexcellent soccer in an exciting<br />\nconfrontation that saw tha Jays<br />\nand Quakers keep up with each<br />\nother stride for stride.<br />\nThe Jays were almost able to<br />\nbreak on top early sparked by<br />\ngreat play from forward Greg<br />\nCunningham and lineman Larry<br />\nMcGowarn.<br />\nFive minutes into the half,<br />\nMyrick fed a beautiful pass to<br />\nCunningham who was able to get<br />\nahead of the defenders with a<br />\nclear breakaway. In anticipation<br />\nof a possible score, though,<br />\nCunningham was unable to get<br />\noff a strong shot and he sent the<br />\nball wide of the net.<br />\nA few minutes later Larry<br />\nz\\<br />\n,e,<br />\nMcGowan<br />\nbattled for the control<br />\n1.1<br />\nof the ball in the Swarthmore<br /><br />\nend. lie was able to take the ball<br />\nin the left corner and send a<br />\nbeautiful pass to Cunningham<br />\nright in front of the opposing<br />\nnet. The excellent work of a<br />\nQuaker defender spelled the<br />\ndifference on that play as he<br />\nblocked the strong shot taken by<br />\nCunningham.<br />\nThe game, though, was evenly<br />\nbalanced and the Jays had ample<br />\nopportunity to show off their<br />\nstrong defense which had fully<br />\nrecoveied following their loss to<br />\nWestern Maryland last week.<br />\nThe opposing offense, led by<br />\nformer all-American Mac<br />\nToddman, gave some anxious<br />\nmoments to Jay fans in the first<br />\nhalf, but in the end it was Ken<br />\nSuesse and the defense that<br />\nprevailed.<br />\nIn one instance, Toddman<br />\ndribbled downfield and made a<br />\nbeautiful reverse pass to a<br />\nlineman who sent a ten yard shot<br />\nright on net. Goalie Ken Suesse<br />\nwas in perfect position to stop<br />\nthe ball; the half ended in a tie.<br />\nEarly in the second half, heavy<br />\noffensive pressure was applied by<br />\nthe Quakers. A scramble in front<br />\nof the Blue Jay net resulted in a<br />\npenalty committed by the<br />\ndefense and gave Swarthmore a<br />\ndirect kick. On the ensuing kick,<br />\nthe Swarthmore back was able to<br />\nloop his shot over the human<br />\nwall formed by the Jay defense,<br /><br />\nbut once again Suesse was able to<br />\nmake the save.<br />\nHopkins offense continued to<br />\nform opportunities in the<br />\nSwarthmore end, but they were<br />\njust never able to p'ut the ball<br />\npast the goalie who had an<br />\nexcellent.day.<br />\nForward Jeff Weissglass took a<br />\nlong pass from back Ignatowski<br />\nand approached the Swarthmore<br />\nnet. Weissglass sent a shot toward<br />\nthe left corner of the net but the<br />\nQuaker goalie made the save.<br />\nAs time began to run down in<br />\nthe second half the game seemed<br />\nto be headed into overtime. But.<br />\nwith only two minutes left in the<br />\ngame Swarthmore finally put a<br />\ntally in the scoreboard. The play<br />\noccurred when a Swarthmore<br />\nleftwinger took an angle shot on<br />\nSuesse who made the save, but<br />\nthe rebound was put in by<br />\nforward Tom Gilbert for the 1-0<br />\nvictory.<br />\nThe Jays had also been<br />\noutshot 18-12 during the game<br />\nwith forward Cunningham<br />\ncollecting 6 of the shots.<br />\n\"It's a tough loss for us,\" cited<br />\na misty eyed Coach Oliver.<br />\n\"We're playing hurt but we're<br />\nplaying with heart. We have a<br />\nseason left to play and we are<br />\ngoing to do well.\"<br />\nThe Jay record now stands at<br />\n2-3-1 with their next game to be<br />\nplayed Wednesday in Gettysburg.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41150, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "8e52fc8f-f0c9-45e3-8c31-3f543101214b", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14325-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14325, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "1404c46e-0e1c-4202-a5b2-076a6f8b7a05", "url": "/node/14325"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "5979bc3b-ef82-4b19-9e21-64b5ae37c18f"}]}
