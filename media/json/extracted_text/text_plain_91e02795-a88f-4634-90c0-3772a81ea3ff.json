At<br />\nthat time there was uncertainty regarding the lecture<br />\nseries' future.<br />\nThis year witnesses a reincarnation of the Lectures.<br />\nUnlike many series, the University Lectures are not directed to an esoteric group but ard intended to be comprehensible to the -intelligent laymen.<br />\nWe trust that these \"intelligent laymen\" will provide<br />\nsomething more than a token response next Wednesday.<br />\n<br />\nAxe-Handling<br />\nThe administrative axe at this University can be a<br />\nterrifying thing.- When it ig taken up, faculties \u2022gape,<br />\nCouncils tremble and heads roll.<br />\nWhen that axe is taken up merely because its wielder<br />\nhas an itchy feeling for some kind of disciplinary justice,<br />\nthe result can be devastating.<br />\nIt can also -be downright repugnant.<br />\nThe travesty of justice that took place last December<br />\n11 as a result of a student \"revival\" demonstration only<br />\nshows once again that our Dean of Students and certain<br />\n\"student leaders\" need a lesson in integrity and axehandling.<br />\nThe results of DSRC hearings for five students and<br />\nadministrative \"approval\" of the recommended penalties<br />\nas announced ,by DSRC president Stu Hanlein at a recent<br />\nStudent Council meeting cloaks the truth and glosses<br />\nwhat is s unjust a piece of high-level skullduggery as<br />\nwe've seen in years.<br />\nIn the first place, the DSRC, though its hearing procedures were well-handled and suitably fair, made disciplinary recommendations which overstepped the boundaries of its jurisdiction. Only two student bodies on<br />\nthis campus can make recommendations for a student's<br />\nacademic suspension or expulsion: the Student Council<br />\nand the Honor Commission. In a case such as this where<br />\nan academic penalty is recommended, the Student Council<br />\nshould be called in tO review and hear the.testimony.<br />\nBut more important is the right of every individual<br />\nto a free trial, to determine not only the actuality of his<br />\nguilt but also the extent of it.

Being as liberal as<br />\none dares to be in our society,<br />\nI have received such notices<br />\nwith \u2022much pain.<br />\nIt appears to me that our Student Council, several of whose<br />\nmembers I have voted for, ought<br />\nto reappraise its position, responsibilities, and its limitations<br />\non this campus. (It might also<br />\ntake the time to attend a few<br />\nlectures in Political Science I.)<br />\nOur Student Council doesn't<br />\ndo so much that it cannot take<br />\nthe time to fully inform its constituents of its activities. It is<br />\nnot the U. S. Senate or House<br />\nof Representatives\u2014there are no<br />\nsubcommittees iny e sti gating<br />\nrackets o,r rockets; there is no<br />\ntop secret or classified information. In fact, there is no reason<br />\nwhy anything that the SC has<br />\nto discuss should be kept from<br />\nthose who have chosen them for<br />\noffice\u2014the Hopkins .Community.<br />\nI,might also remind the reigning councilmen that their council, in its crudest form, is nothing but a method of giving certain fortunate individuals a<br />\nchance to get a school key (it<br />\nlooks great on a law or med<br />\nschool application), and perhaps<br />\nlearn a little about government<br />\nby participating in a sort of<br />\ngovernment. Unfortunately the<br />\nSC is more concerned about. the<br />\nkeys and satisfaction of egos<br />\nthan it is about learning about<br />\nrepresentative government.<br />\nPetty politicking is fine for<br />\nhigh-school, but may I remind<br />\nthe SC that it is supposed to<br />\nrepresent university students.<br />\nMay I also remind the council<br />\nmembers that their responsibilities could be discharged equally<br />\nwell, perhaps better, by the administrator of the university.<br />\nLet me reiterate that there is<br />\nnothing that could possibly go<br />\non in a Student Council meeting<br />\nthat is not .the business of, or<br />\nshould not be known by, the students of this university. If it is<br />\nso, that the Student Council<br />\nmust be secretive about some of<br />\nits activities, then there must be<br />\nsomething that someone is<br />\nafraid, or ashamed, to let the<br />\nstudents know about.

Note: We are happy,to find<br />\nat least one student has seen fit<br />\nto s- peitic out on this topic. Either<br />\nway the truth never hurts.<br />\n<br />\nIn the spring of. 1954, however, it was decided to make the<br />\nBall a big social event. The<br />\ndance was encouragingly successful:<br />\nNext year, 1955, the Second<br />\nArmy Dance Band delighted a<br />\nsellout crowd in the gym. For<br />\nadded distinction and to observe<br />\narmy customs, this Ball featured<br />\na Commanders Cotillion and no<br />\ncorsages.<br />\nSandwiched between the Newman Club Dance and the Spring<br />\nCotillion, the 1956 edition of the<br />\nMilitary Ball ranked as one of<br />\nthe best dances of the year,<br />\nattendance-wise and otherwise.<br />\nThe 1957 and 1958 Military<br />\nBalls were well attended and<br />\nconsequently<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nBut<br />\nlast year it was another story.<br />\nThose who went, enjoyed themselves. The majority, who were<br />\nnot present, probably enjoyed<br />\nreading Chemistry I.<br />\n\u2022 During the period of these<br />\nsucces.sful dances a new word<br />\nwas added to the Hopkins- dictionary: coercion\u2014defined on the<br />\nHomewood campus, it covered<br />\nthe charge of student and cadre<br />\nofficers intimidating cadets<br />\nthrough insinuations in an attempt to get the cadets to buy<br />\nMilitary Ball tickets.<br />\nUnlike the other campus organizations, the ROTC lacks a<br />\nstanding treasury; therefore, it<br />\nis dependent on ticket sales for<br />\nthe operating expenses of the<br />\nBall. At present, seniors are taxed<br />\n$12 for class dues, and the rest<br />\nof the student body, $7. Average yearly fraternity dues are<br />\n$100. We have an option in<br />\ncoming to Hopkins: joining fraternities, and ROTC, is voluntary.<br />\nThen how can one object, to<br />\na' modest social fee, a fee that<br />\nwill be paid several times over<br />\nby the second month of his junior year? On monetary grounds,<br />\nrebuttals are weak -excuses.<br />\nMust one then attribute hesitancy to support the Ball to<br />\nindifference to the whole military program in which the student has voluntarily placed himself? - In terms of fun alone, this<br />\nindifference; or lack of morale,<br />\ncost more than the $3 a year<br />\nselling price.<br />\nA.

At<br />\nthat time there was uncertainty regarding the lecture<br />\nseries' future.<br />\nThis year witnesses a reincarnation of the Lectures.<br />\nUnlike many series, the University Lectures are not directed to an esoteric group but ard intended to be comprehensible to the -intelligent laymen.<br />\nWe trust that these \"intelligent laymen\" will provide<br />\nsomething more than a token response next Wednesday.<br /><br />\nAxe-Handling<br />\nThe administrative axe at this University can be a<br />\nterrifying thing.- When it ig taken up, faculties \u2022gape,<br />\nCouncils tremble and heads roll.<br />\nWhen that axe is taken up merely because its wielder<br />\nhas an itchy feeling for some kind of disciplinary justice,<br />\nthe result can be devastating.<br />\nIt can also -be downright repugnant.<br />\nThe travesty of justice that took place last December<br />\n11 as a result of a student \"revival\" demonstration only<br />\nshows once again that our Dean of Students and certain<br />\n\"student leaders\" need a lesson in integrity and axehandling.<br />\nThe results of DSRC hearings for five students and<br />\nadministrative \"approval\" of the recommended penalties<br />\nas announced ,by DSRC president Stu Hanlein at a recent<br />\nStudent Council meeting cloaks the truth and glosses<br />\nwhat is s unjust a piece of high-level skullduggery as<br />\nwe've seen in years.<br />\nIn the first place, the DSRC, though its hearing procedures were well-handled and suitably fair, made disciplinary recommendations which overstepped the boundaries of its jurisdiction. Only two student bodies on<br />\nthis campus can make recommendations for a student's<br />\nacademic suspension or expulsion: the Student Council<br />\nand the Honor Commission. In a case such as this where<br />\nan academic penalty is recommended, the Student Council<br />\nshould be called in tO review and hear the.testimony.<br />\nBut more important is the right of every individual<br />\nto a free trial, to determine not only the actuality of his<br />\nguilt but also the extent of it.

Being as liberal as<br />\none dares to be in our society,<br />\nI have received such notices<br />\nwith \u2022much pain.<br />\nIt appears to me that our Student Council, several of whose<br />\nmembers I have voted for, ought<br />\nto reappraise its position, responsibilities, and its limitations<br />\non this campus. (It might also<br />\ntake the time to attend a few<br />\nlectures in Political Science I.)<br />\nOur Student Council doesn't<br />\ndo so much that it cannot take<br />\nthe time to fully inform its constituents of its activities. It is<br />\nnot the U. S. Senate or House<br />\nof Representatives\u2014there are no<br />\nsubcommittees iny e sti gating<br />\nrackets o,r rockets; there is no<br />\ntop secret or classified information. In fact, there is no reason<br />\nwhy anything that the SC has<br />\nto discuss should be kept from<br />\nthose who have chosen them for<br />\noffice\u2014the Hopkins .Community.<br />\nI,might also remind the reigning councilmen that their council, in its crudest form, is nothing but a method of giving certain fortunate individuals a<br />\nchance to get a school key (it<br />\nlooks great on a law or med<br />\nschool application), and perhaps<br />\nlearn a little about government<br />\nby participating in a sort of<br />\ngovernment. Unfortunately the<br />\nSC is more concerned about. the<br />\nkeys and satisfaction of egos<br />\nthan it is about learning about<br />\nrepresentative government.<br />\nPetty politicking is fine for<br />\nhigh-school, but may I remind<br />\nthe SC that it is supposed to<br />\nrepresent university students.<br />\nMay I also remind the council<br />\nmembers that their responsibilities could be discharged equally<br />\nwell, perhaps better, by the administrator of the university.<br />\nLet me reiterate that there is<br />\nnothing that could possibly go<br />\non in a Student Council meeting<br />\nthat is not .the business of, or<br />\nshould not be known by, the students of this university. If it is<br />\nso, that the Student Council<br />\nmust be secretive about some of<br />\nits activities, then there must be<br />\nsomething that someone is<br />\nafraid, or ashamed, to let the<br />\nstudents know about.

Either<br />\nway the truth never hurts.<br /><br />\nIn the spring of. 1954, however, it was decided to make the<br />\nBall a big social event. The<br />\ndance was encouragingly successful:<br />\nNext year, 1955, the Second<br />\nArmy Dance Band delighted a<br />\nsellout crowd in the gym. For<br />\nadded distinction and to observe<br />\narmy customs, this Ball featured<br />\na Commanders Cotillion and no<br />\ncorsages.<br />\nSandwiched between the Newman Club Dance and the Spring<br />\nCotillion, the 1956 edition of the<br />\nMilitary Ball ranked as one of<br />\nthe best dances of the year,<br />\nattendance-wise and otherwise.<br />\nThe 1957 and 1958 Military<br />\nBalls were well attended and<br />\nconsequently<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nBut<br />\nlast year it was another story.<br />\nThose who went, enjoyed themselves.

At present, seniors are taxed<br />\n$12 for class dues, and the rest<br />\nof the student body, $7. Average yearly fraternity dues are<br />\n$100. We have an option in<br />\ncoming to Hopkins: joining fraternities, and ROTC, is voluntary.<br />\nThen how can one object, to<br />\na' modest social fee, a fee that<br />\nwill be paid several times over<br />\nby the second month of his junior year? On monetary grounds,<br />\nrebuttals are weak -excuses.<br />\nMust one then attribute hesitancy to support the Ball to<br />\nindifference to the whole military program in which the student has voluntarily placed himself? - In terms of fun alone, this<br />\nindifference; or lack of morale,<br />\ncost more than the $3 a year<br />\nselling price.<br />\nA.
