Russel, of the Catholic Univers<br />\nity<br />\nof America, Washington,D.C.,opened<br />\nthe second series of leetures on<br />\nreligion at the Hopkins, sponso<br />\nred<br />\njointly by the National Conference<br />\nof Jews and Christians and the University. Dr. Russel's lecture was<br />\nthe first of three which he is to present dealing with the \"Historical<br />\nAspects of Catholicism.\"<br />\nDr. Russel, in his opening lecture<br />\n,<br />\nconcerned himself chiefly with<br />\nthe<br />\nChristological controversies of the<br />\nfourth and fifth centuries. These controversies centered about the question of the nature of Christ and<br />\nthe<br />\ndoctrine of incarnation.<br />\nDevelopment Of Controvemy<br />\nAfter the period of Roman persecution it was easy to become<br />\na<br />\nChristian and many new convert<br />\ns<br />\npoured in bringing with them questioning minds. One of the first<br />\nissues<br />\nwas provoked by the doctrin<br />\ne of<br />\nArius, a theologist of Alexandria,<br />\nwho was one of the leaders<br />\nof the<br />\nintellectuals of his time, and who was<br />\nunconsciously fighting the battle<br />\nfor<br />\npaganism. The doctrine maintained<br />\nthat Christ was not God and<br />\nthat<br />\nthere was no such thing as God<br />\nbecoming a man.<br />\nThe orthodox Christians also<br />\nhad<br />\nvery able leaders the chief of which<br />\nwas Athanasius. The fight betwee<br />\nn<br />\nthe two men assumed large proportions and resulted in the convoca<br />\ntion of the Conference of Nicea<br />\nby<br />\nConstantine in order to draw<br />\nup a<br />\ndefinite and binding Christian<br />\ncreed.<br />\nThis conference marked the -crushi<br />\nng<br />\nof Arianism and the adoption<br />\nof the<br />\ntrue Christian creed.<br /><br />\nAnchored 47 miles offshore, the<br />\n\u2014Nantucket Lightship guides traffic on<br />\nthe Atlantic Coast.
