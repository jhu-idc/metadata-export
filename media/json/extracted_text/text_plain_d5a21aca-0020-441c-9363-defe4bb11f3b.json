The topic<br />\nof the speaker's address was<br />\n\"Christianity and Paganism in<br />\nModern Civilization\".<br />\nChristian Morality<br />\n<br />\nDr. Ferrero describes the growth<br />\nof paganism and its serious threat<br />\nagainst the best in western civilization. \"In the middle ages Europe<br />\nwas a theocracy, as still today are<br />\nthe Musselmen lands and many<br />\neastern countries,\" the speaker<br />\nclaimed. \"And because Christian<br />\nmorality did not permit Europe to<br />\ngo to spleep\", he continued, \"Christian theocracy of the middle ages<br />\ndid not become crystallized like the<br />\ntheocracies of the Musselmen transformed itself, with an increased activity, step by step, into the wonderful present civilization, European-American. \"Christian morality accomplished this mainly by<br />\nsubjecting the power and the state<br />\nto morality\", he said.<br />\nEffects of the Renaissance<br />\n<br />\nDr. Ferrero went on to show how<br />\nfro mthe sixteenth century onwards<br />\nthe great political, scientific, and<br />\nmilitary progress brought on by the<br />\nRenaissance was accompanied by a<br />\ngrowing tendency in all lands towards making the state the supreme power, and to the subordination of morality to power, which<br />\nis the negative of Christianity.<br />\nGrowth of Paganism<br />\n\"Within the last half century, the<br />\nworld has become more paganized\", emphasized the noted historian and philosopher, -and on the<br />\nday western civilization is again<br />\nsubordinated to a pagan theocratic<br />\nconception of the state, western<br />\ncivilization will have fallen into irreparable decadence\". Dr. Ferrero<br />\nconcluded with the explanation of<br />\nthe great necessity of calling attention to this phenomena in order that<br />\na vigorous force be put forward in<br />\ndefense of Christian morality.<br />\nHistorian and Philosopher<br />\n<br />\nDr. Guglielmo Ferrero's first<br />\nvolume of his great work, \"The<br />\nGreatness and Decline of Rome,'<br />\nstamped him as one of the world's<br />\ngreatest historians. His work, \"Between the Old World and the<br />\nNew\", expressing valuable philosophical theories, places him in the<br />\nline of great philosophers. Some<br />\nof his more successful works are<br />\n\"The Young Europe,\" \"The Militarism\", and \"The Thircl Rome\",<br />\npublished in America as \"The Seven<br />\nVices\".<br />\nRoosevelt's Guest<br />\n<br />\nTheodore Roosevelt, then President, invited Dr. Ferrero to come<br />\nto the United States. Dr. Ferrero<br />\ncame in 1908 and lived at the White<br />\nHouse during most of his stay. It<br />\nwas at this time that President<br />\nRoosevelt declared him to be \"the<br />\nworld's greatest living historian\".<br />\nWhile in America he lectured before many of our leading universities.<br />\n<br />\nFour Opponents; Jay Defense May<br />\nBe Tested<br />\nAfter running roughshod over<br />\nits last four efforts, the Black and<br />\nBlue twelve may prepare itself for<br />\nopposition tomorrow of a better<br />\ncalibre than any it has encountered<br />\nthis season.

M. Jackson, Jr., sports editor of<br />\nThe Evening Capital, of Annapolis,<br />\nMd.<br />\nMr. Jackson further declares:<br />\nSt. John's is thoroughly disgusted with<br />\nthe way Hopkins has acted and from an<br />\nangle of self-respect could not be obliged<br />\nto meet the Jays on June 6, the date the<br />\nBaltimoreans are now endeavoring to force<br />\nthe locals after twice breaking faith on<br />\nwhat appeared definite dates with the Annapolitans.

In other words they see 'the<br />\npapering on the wall'. An excuse that<br />\nthey cannot play two games in one week<br />\nis rather silly.

In rejecting.,theSe offers by Homewood officials, the Crabtown authorities asserted, it is said, that the two April<br />\ndates were too early in the season<br />\nand,that the June date was too late<br />\nin the season and too near to graduation time.<br />\nFollowing this, St. John's offered<br />\nMay 2 as the lone suitable date for<br />\nthe annual clash. However, Hopkins was forced not to accept the<br />\ndate because of a game, scheduled<br />\nmany months previous, with Princeton. To meet the Annapolis twelve<br />\nthe day after was termed\"a physical impossibility\".<br />\nCompromise Suggested<br />\n<br />\nThe Athletic Board here, in a<br />\ncompromise, suggested that St.<br />\nJohn's play Princeton on May 1 and<br />\nHopkins on May 2; Hopkins,<br />\nPrinceton on May 23 and University of Maryland on June 6.

The topic<br />\nof the speaker's address was<br />\n\"Christianity and Paganism in<br />\nModern Civilization\".<br />\nChristian Morality<br /><br />\nDr. Ferrero describes the growth<br />\nof paganism and its serious threat<br />\nagainst the best in western civilization. \"In the middle ages Europe<br />\nwas a theocracy, as still today are<br />\nthe Musselmen lands and many<br />\neastern countries,\" the speaker<br />\nclaimed. \"And because Christian<br />\nmorality did not permit Europe to<br />\ngo to spleep\", he continued, \"Christian theocracy of the middle ages<br />\ndid not become crystallized like the<br />\ntheocracies of the Musselmen transformed itself, with an increased activity, step by step, into the wonderful present civilization, European-American. \"Christian morality accomplished this mainly by<br />\nsubjecting the power and the state<br />\nto morality\", he said.<br />\nEffects of the Renaissance<br /><br />\nDr. Ferrero went on to show how<br />\nfro mthe sixteenth century onwards<br />\nthe great political, scientific, and<br />\nmilitary progress brought on by the<br />\nRenaissance was accompanied by a<br />\ngrowing tendency in all lands towards making the state the supreme power, and to the subordination of morality to power, which<br />\nis the negative of Christianity.<br />\nGrowth of Paganism<br />\n\"Within the last half century, the<br />\nworld has become more paganized\", emphasized the noted historian and philosopher, -and on the<br />\nday western civilization is again<br />\nsubordinated to a pagan theocratic<br />\nconception of the state, western<br />\ncivilization will have fallen into irreparable decadence\". Dr. Ferrero<br />\nconcluded with the explanation of<br />\nthe great necessity of calling attention to this phenomena in order that<br />\na vigorous force be put forward in<br />\ndefense of Christian morality.<br />\nHistorian and Philosopher<br /><br />\nDr. Guglielmo Ferrero's first<br />\nvolume of his great work, \"The<br />\nGreatness and Decline of Rome,'<br />\nstamped him as one of the world's<br />\ngreatest historians. His work, \"Between the Old World and the<br />\nNew\", expressing valuable philosophical theories, places him in the<br />\nline of great philosophers. Some<br />\nof his more successful works are<br />\n\"The Young Europe,\" \"The Militarism\", and \"The Thircl Rome\",<br />\npublished in America as \"The Seven<br />\nVices\".<br />\nRoosevelt's Guest<br /><br />\nTheodore Roosevelt, then President, invited Dr. Ferrero to come<br />\nto the United States. Dr. Ferrero<br />\ncame in 1908 and lived at the White<br />\nHouse during most of his stay. It<br />\nwas at this time that President<br />\nRoosevelt declared him to be \"the<br />\nworld's greatest living historian\".<br />\nWhile in America he lectured before many of our leading universities.<br /><br />\nFour Opponents; Jay Defense May<br />\nBe Tested<br />\nAfter running roughshod over<br />\nits last four efforts, the Black and<br />\nBlue twelve may prepare itself for<br />\nopposition tomorrow of a better<br />\ncalibre than any it has encountered<br />\nthis season.

In other words they see 'the<br />\npapering on the wall'. An excuse that<br />\nthey cannot play two games in one week<br />\nis rather silly.

In rejecting.,theSe offers by Homewood officials, the Crabtown authorities asserted, it is said, that the two April<br />\ndates were too early in the season<br />\nand,that the June date was too late<br />\nin the season and too near to graduation time.<br />\nFollowing this, St. John's offered<br />\nMay 2 as the lone suitable date for<br />\nthe annual clash. However, Hopkins was forced not to accept the<br />\ndate because of a game, scheduled<br />\nmany months previous, with Princeton. To meet the Annapolis twelve<br />\nthe day after was termed\"a physical impossibility\".<br />\nCompromise Suggested<br /><br />\nThe Athletic Board here, in a<br />\ncompromise, suggested that St.<br />\nJohn's play Princeton on May 1 and<br />\nHopkins on May 2; Hopkins,<br />\nPrinceton on May 23 and University of Maryland on June 6.
