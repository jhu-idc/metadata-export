Hopkin\u00b7s made<br />\ntwelve first downs against a total<br />\nof three for the invaders.

Reynolds was,<br />\nagain, the most consistent ground<br />\ngainer for Hopkins. The speedy<br />\nhalfback was called upon time<br />\nand time again when only a long<br />\nrun meant a first down. Reed<br />\nand Beeler ate holes in the Garnet line on bucks and off tackle<br />\nslices that. netted upwards of<br />\nseven yards each time.<br />\nSwarthmore Scores First<br />\nThe first scoring was done by<br />\nSwarthmore. After an exchange<br />\nof punts, the invaders launched<br />\nan aerial \u00b7attack that was climaxed by a forty-yard pass, Funke to<br />\nSipler, that netted Swarthmore's<br />\nonly touchdown. Shembs, Garnet<br />\nleft halfback, added the extra<br />\npoint. After ~e kick-off, Hopkins gained on an exchange of<br />\npunts, and the quarter ended with<br />\nR eed placing the ball on Swarthmore's 30-yard line, after a beautiful 40-yard sprint. After losing<br />\nground on a miscue and a blocked<br />\npass, Hopkins smashed through<br />\nthe Garnet for a touchdown. The<br />\nmarch was featured by a 25-yard<br />\ndash of Beeler's, and a 30-yard<br />\nbroken field run of Kelly's.

Proceeding further Dr.<br />\nOliver said, that following its policy<br />\nof Student Regulation, the dormitory would be administrated by a<br />\nBoard of Governors, whose duties<br />\nwould be to provide a means of<br />\nrelationship between the authorities<br />\nand the students; to prevent infringements of Dormitory Regulations, and to promote the social<br />\nwelfare of the group.<br />\nBoard Of Governors Elected<br />\nThe Board of Governors is composed of two representatives from<br />\neach entry, one of whom is chosen<br />\nby the dormitory authorities and the<br />\nother by the residents of the particular entry.<br />\nElections Hotly\u00b7 Contested<br />\n.<br />\nDuring the past week the various<br />\nentries have held their respective<br />\nelections.

Shembs, Garnet<br />\nleft halfback, added the extra<br />\npoint. After ~e kick-off, Hopkins gained on an exchange of<br />\npunts, and the quarter ended with<br />\nR eed placing the ball on Swarthmore's 30-yard line, after a beautiful 40-yard sprint. After losing<br />\nground on a miscue and a blocked<br />\npass, Hopkins smashed through<br />\nthe Garnet for a touchdown. The<br />\nmarch was featured by a 25-yard<br />\ndash of Beeler's, and a 30-yard<br />\nbroken field run of Kelly's. This<br />\nlast . netting Hopkins' first marker, was easily the evening's prettie st play.

He outlined the traditions<br />\nof the institution, saying in part,<br />\nthat the dormitory was lent by the<br />\nUniversity to its residents without<br />\nrestrictions, and consequently behooved students to respect this<br />\nfreedom. Proceeding further Dr.<br />\nOliver said, that following its policy<br />\nof Student Regulation, the dormitory would be administrated by a<br />\nBoard of Governors, whose duties<br />\nwould be to provide a means of<br />\nrelationship between the authorities<br />\nand the students; to prevent infringements of Dormitory Regulations, and to promote the social<br />\nwelfare of the group.<br />\nBoard Of Governors Elected<br />\nThe Board of Governors is composed of two representatives from<br />\neach entry, one of whom is chosen<br />\nby the dormitory authorities and the<br />\nother by the residents of the particular entry.<br />\nElections Hotly\u00b7 Contested<br />\n.<br />\nDuring the past week the various<br />\nentries have held their respective<br />\nelections. Differing markedly from<br />\npast years, the elections were hotly<br />\ncontested. This was especially true<br />\nin \"A\" and \"B\" entries where two<br />\nelections had to be held. As yet<br />\nthere is still no one chosen as representative in \"A\" entry where the<br />\nvotes for Squire, Goepp and Caplan are equal. In \"B\" a contest between the Undergraduates and<br />\nGraduates resulted in a victory for<br />\nthe former, when they elected urnberger at the second ballot.<br />\nFrom the latest reports the following list of the men representing<br />\nthe residents has been compiled as<br />\nfollows:<br />\nBoard of Governors ( appointe\nEntry A-Dr. Andrews.<br />\nEntry B-D.

Wheeler gives a detailed resume<br />\nof his course in Advanced English<br />\nComposition.<br />\nAccording to the journal, the<br />\ncourse is designed to acquaint the<br />\n&amp;tudent with the more progressive<br />\nforms of written expression, and to<br />\nencourage him to develop an original style by the injection of his per:sonality into his writing. Unusual<br />\ndevices are employed by Dr.<br />\n:W heeler to accomplish this object,<br />\nthe principal one being that each<br />\n.class compiles its own text book.<br />\nThis text includes the best compo\u00b7sitions by the members of the class,<br />\nwhich are chosen after a thorough<br />\n'discussion of the relative merits of<br />\neach paper.<br />\nClass Is Limited<br />\nOnly those who exhibit an ability to handle the rudiments of English composition and gr_a mmar are<br />\ngiven an opportunity to join the<br />\nclass.

On the occasion referred to, the President of<br />\nthe University was to address thi;<br />\ngroup, composed largely of entering<br />\nstudents. Upon his reaching the<br />\nplatform, the first sight to greet<br />\nhim was one of a bold and brawny<br />\nfrosh sporting an R. 0. T.
