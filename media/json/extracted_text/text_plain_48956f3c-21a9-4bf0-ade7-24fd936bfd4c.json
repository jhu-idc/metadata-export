To some extent<br />\nthis threat has been checked and the need answered.<br />\nThe action taken was a request for closer supervision of tests<br />\nand examinations by the instructors. It was a precaution put into<br />\neffect without any hesitation. The Acting Dean of McCoy College<br />\nis lo he commended for the sift enactment of this temporary<br />\nmeasure.<br />\nWe shall continue to favor the extension of the day school<br />\nhonor system to the night sessions.

Discussion will be directed toward their honor<br />\ncode as the ideal goal.<br />\nReason demands, however, that this goal not be set up as the<br />\nonly acceptable solution. The essential problem, it is repeated for<br />\nemphasis, is to stamp out cheating. If the individuals whose duty<br />\nit will be to choose the better method find the obstacles to an honor<br />\nsystem too great to overcome, only one alternative will be left to<br />\nthem.<br />\nWe are confident that, inasmuch as attention has been focused<br />\non the disturbing state Of affairs in the !light school, avoidance<br />\nof the issue will not persist. The least possible measure that can<br />\nbe effected is a thorough and workable system of proctoring.<br />\n<br />\nA LIBRARY REQUEST<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins libraries are open many hours during<br />\nevery day of the- week they are not available to students on<br />\nSundays.<br />\nSunday afternoon and evening are spent in study by many<br />\nwho have heavy curricular and extra-curricular duties permitting them few hours of concentration during the week.

To some extent<br />\nthis threat has been checked and the need answered.<br />\nThe action taken was a request for closer supervision of tests<br />\nand examinations by the instructors. It was a precaution put into<br />\neffect without any hesitation. The Acting Dean of McCoy College<br />\nis lo he commended for the sift enactment of this temporary<br />\nmeasure.<br />\nWe shall continue to favor the extension of the day school<br />\nhonor system to the night sessions. It seems clearly unavoidable<br />\nto us that a person without the will to preserve his honor has no<br />\nplace in a division of the Johns Hopkins University, regardless<br />\nof how large or how heterogeneous that division might be.<br />\nA number of formidable obsttacles stand in the way of the<br />\nestablishment of an honor commission in McCoy College, the most<br />\nexasperating of which is the diffieulty of impressing on the shortterm, part-time students the importance of an honor code.<br />\nIndications show that every effort will be made both by interested day students and by the Dean to work out answers to these<br />\nvarious problems. Discussion will be directed toward their honor<br />\ncode as the ideal goal.<br />\nReason demands, however, that this goal not be set up as the<br />\nonly acceptable solution. The essential problem, it is repeated for<br />\nemphasis, is to stamp out cheating. If the individuals whose duty<br />\nit will be to choose the better method find the obstacles to an honor<br />\nsystem too great to overcome, only one alternative will be left to<br />\nthem.<br />\nWe are confident that, inasmuch as attention has been focused<br />\non the disturbing state Of affairs in the !light school, avoidance<br />\nof the issue will not persist. The least possible measure that can<br />\nbe effected is a thorough and workable system of proctoring.<br /><br />\nA LIBRARY REQUEST<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins libraries are open many hours during<br />\nevery day of the- week they are not available to students on<br />\nSundays.<br />\nSunday afternoon and evening are spent in study by many<br />\nwho have heavy curricular and extra-curricular duties permitting them few hours of concentration during the week. It is at<br />\nthis time that the main reading room should be open for reference<br />\nwork and as a place to \"get away\" from home, the dorm or the<br />\nfraternity house.<br />\nAn arrangement such as this would not require more than<br />\ntwo student librarians on hand to supervise.

This apparent complication<br />\nactually gives the production both<br />\na strong and a weak point, for<br />\nalthough one of the main faults<br />\nof the poorer members of the cast<br />\nIs the stiffness and hammyness<br />\nbrought about by a constant shifting from the action of the play<br />\nto the action of the play within a<br />\nplay, the actual effect of this transition, quite sudden at times, is<br />\nmost effective.<br />\nOther major characters who do<br />\nan admirable job are Ralph Berkhausen, playing with only-an occa-<br /><br />\n.3A #120,4<br />\n4,7<br />\n-r<br /><br />\n0,<br />\nte24.<br />\nsional trace of stiffness the part<br />\nof an actor doctor, and Helen<br />\nHepbron, as an offended pseudosocialite.

Originally billed for some<br />\n30 hours, in two-hour stretches,<br />\nthe experiment was prolonged to<br />\nabout 40 when what the researcher<br />\ncalled \"some very interesting indications\" were discovered in the<br />\nearly statistics.<br />\nSince this particular project<br />\ncalled for listening over earphoneS<br />\nto endless successions of singularly unvarying museial notes, and<br />\nnoting down the variations, it<br />\nrapidly grew to the proportions of<br />\ntorture. Constant fallings asleep<br />\ninside the specially-provided soundproof room were rudely interrupted by an anxious \"Are you still<br />\nthere?\" The stock answer was a<br />\nswallowed yawn, plus \"Sure. I'm<br />\nfine\u2014uh, how about taking a rest<br />\nnow?\"<br />\nThe Lines<br />\nBut the most tiring of all the<br />\ntests was a mere three-hour stint<br />\nspent squinting through the wrong<br />\nend of a telescope at a straight<br />\nline. Across this line at changing<br />\nanother<br />\nintervals was placed<br />\nstraight line. The trick was to<br />\nestimate the interval\u2014one-third<br />\nof the line, three-tenths, and so<br />\nforth. That job was such a strain<br />\nthat the guinea pig was provided<br />\nwith coffee to keep him awake<br />\nabsolutely-free, mind you!<br />\nThe experiment which came<br />\nnearest to disaster involved dartthrowing in an unlit room. After<br />\neach toss at the target, the guinea<br />\npig was shown how much he had<br />\nmissed by\u2014the point being to see<br />\nhow badly he was discouraged.<br />\nOne subject got so downhearted<br />\nthat he narrowly missed \u2022 the instructor.
