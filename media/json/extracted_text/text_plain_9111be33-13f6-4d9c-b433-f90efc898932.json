This<br />\nmay take the form of intellectual inquiry or participation in<br />\nsocial groups.<br />\nPatterson denied the existence of an \"ethnic instinct.\"<br />\nInstead the Jamaican-born sociologist focused on ethnicity as a<br />\n\"strategy of action, a way to<br />\nmobilize groups.\" It is \"not a<br />\nprimeval urge.., people choose<br />\nand are aware of choice. What is<br />\nimportant is that people believe<br />\nin [these] groups.\"<br />\n\"Ethnic strategies\" are used<br />\ntrying to enter the<br />\noutsiders<br />\nby<br />\nAmerican system, according to<br />\nPatterson. The strategy may be<br />\neither inclusive or exclusive. The<br />\ninclusive method is by definition<br />\ntemporary; integration is its<br />\ngoal. The group bands together<br />\nto give its members power but<br />\n\"ultimate success implies the<br />\nend of the group.\" This is \"not<br />\nto say they passively give in to<br />\nconformity,\" Patterson added.<br />\n\"The struggle will change both<br />\nthe group and the dominant<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nThe exclusive model emphasizes cultural differences. The<br />\nexistence of the group is permanent; they define themselves as<br />\ndistinct internally and seek a<br />\n<br />\n\"symbiotic relationship\" within<br />\nAmerican culture.<br />\nNovak admitted the existence of the use of ethnicity as a<br />\nsocial or political strategy but<br />\nfelt that this use had largely<br />\nbeen excluded in the United<br />\nStates. He was the \"politicization\" of ethnicity as being much<br />\nmore prevalent in Canada.<br />\nPortes characterized Novak's views as \"somewhat opinionated and rosy...emphasizing<br />\nfreedom.\" Novak had said that<br />\nour \"common culture allows<br />\n<br />\nMichael Novak<br />\n<br />\nroom for many different cultures.\" He felt that while \"all<br />\nethnic groups have the feeling of<br />\nnot belonging,\" there is enough<br />\nopportunity in the U.S. to<br />\nassimilate everyone. He did<br />\nallow that \"many of the most<br />\nsuccessful are successful by<br />\nforgetting ethnicity, following<br />\ntheir own desires and instincts.<br />\nthey<br />\ngo<br />\nCharacteristically<br />\nthrough a wrenching split with<br />\nfamily, ethnic group.\"<br />\nPatterson addressed a similar theme in his criticism of the<br />\n\"ethnic revival\" which he described as \"divisive...a diversion<br />\nthat emphasizes the wrong kinds<br />\nof group.\" He thought that this<br />\n\"romantic revolt\" could be both<br />\n\"anti-American\" and \"antiindividualistic,\" that people had<br />\nlost sight of their ultimate<br />\nobjective of Americanization<br />\nand shifted towards an \"exclusive type.\"<br />\nThe two-and-a-half hour<br />\nsymposium<br />\nwith<br />\nconcluded<br />\nquestions from the audience and<br />\na short reception with the<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nThis Monday night Nathan<br />\nGlazer, professor of education<br />\nand sociology at Harvard University, will speak on the topic,<br />\n\"The Presidency of Ethnicity:<br />\nJewish Immigration to the<br />\nUnited States.\"<br />\n<br />\nSecurity Worries Spur Decision<br />\nTo Ban Music From Spring Fair<br />\nwilt,from p. 1<br />\nall the acts of vandalism are<br />\ncaused by these non-students,\"<br />\nsaid Larkin. \"We've had minimal<br />\ntrouble in the lower quad,<br />\nwhere the steel band, Hopkins'<br />\norchestra, and country bands<br />\nperformed, and no trouble at all<br />\nin the Decker Gardens, where<br />\nthe dancers were.

Colombo's<br />\ngreatest concern is that rock<br />\nmusic may draw an uncontrollable crowd to campus. He feels<br />\nthat the redefinition of the<br />\nlength and type of live musical<br />\nentertainment is necessary. \"I<br />\ndon't think that its (rock music's) absence will eliminate the<br />\nundesirables the first year, be-<br />\n<br />\ncause they won't all know about<br />\nit, but it's a step in the right<br />\ndirection,\" he explained.<br />\nLarry Wolfe, coordinator of<br />\nmusic and concerts for the 1981<br />\nFair and a member of the Ad<br />\nHoc Committee, argued that the<br />\nfaculty and administration consider the safety of the students<br />\nto be more important than any<br />\nfair. \"Unfortunately, if we continue the format of continuous<br />\nmusic, odds are that we'll have<br />\nproblems which the faculty,<br />\nadministration and security will<br />\ndisapprove of,\" he said.<br />\nAll those voting in favor of<br />\nbanning daytime rock music<br />\nhope that this year the unwelcome individuals will find the<br />\nmusic contrary to what they<br />\nexpected, and will leave. \"If we<br />\ngive them any rock music at all,<br />\nthey'll hang out and hope for<br />\nmore,\" Wolfe explained. \"Students can appreciate diversity.<br />\nLet's bore the non-students to<br />\ndeath with culture.\"<br />\n\"The alternative plan to<br />\nhave two hours of live music<br />\nfollowed by two hours of filler<br />\n<br />\nprogramming is a terrific opportunity for the SAC groups to<br />\nperform,\" said Junior Class<br />\npresident Chris Hampton, the<br />\nchairman of the Ad Hoc Committee. \"These groups \u2014 the jazz<br />\nband, glee club, and Barnstormers \u2014 go to Hopkins and should<br />\nbe given the chance to show off<br />\ntheir talents at the festival.\"<br />\nBoth he and Wolfe are<br />\namong those who would personally appreciate the rock music<br />\nperformances throughout the<br />\nday, but they emphasized that<br />\nthere are eight locations where<br />\nrock concerts may be held at<br />\nnight indoors with admission<br />\ncontrolled, for the enjoyment of<br />\nthe Hopkins community.\"Hopefully, this way will be the best of<br />\ncommented<br />\nworlds,\"<br />\nboth<br />\nHampton.<br />\nAdvertising for the Fair will<br />\nbe designed to change the image<br />\n\"from a blow-out party to a<br />\nUniversity celebration,\" said<br />\nHampton.

Most of us like rock and roll<br />\n- it seems to have gained something of a<br />\nfollowing over the last few decades.<br />\nBut the committee's decision, howunpopular<br />\nit may prove, was not a<br />\never<br />\nkneejerk reaction. There have been an<br />\nincreasing number of violent incidents at<br />\nthe Fair during the last few years. A<br />\nlengthy report by the committee documents the opinions of a number of knowledgeable people (including Major Robert<br />\nLarkin, Chief of Security) that the elimination of rock music would substantially<br />\nreduce the potential for violence at the<br />\nFair.<br />\nSo, keeping in mind that the committee is not a group of Montiverdi-loving<br />\nnerds, we must look at the larger issue that<br />\nthey themselves addressed in making their<br />\ndecision: namely, what is the purpose of<br />\nthe Fair? Is it to make money or to have<br />\nfun? Fun, of course; and it should be<br />\npossible to have fun, safely, without<br />\nbanning the devil rock 'n' roll.<br />\nLook at it this way: the Fair is<br />\nperhaps the major non-academic event of<br />\nthe year. Within a space of three days,<br />\nsomething close to 150,000 people come<br />\ntromping across the Homewood campus.<br />\nThe money they spend makes possible<br />\nsome of the most attractive features of the<br />\nFair. such as the big-name performers like<br />\nMartin Mull; it makes up a large part of<br />\nmany student activity group budgets: and it<br />\ncontributes several thousand dollars to the<br />\nSAC emergency fund.<br />\nAn event of this magnitude is bound<br />\nhave<br />\nproblems on the same scale. First<br />\nto<br />\nis that the Campus Security<br />\nlist<br />\nthe<br />\non<br />\npolice, no matter how dedicated and<br />\ncompetent they may be, numbers only 14.<br />\nThis is less than one one-hundredth of a<br />\npercent of the size of the crowd they have<br />\n<br />\nto deal with over the three-day period. The<br />\nAdministration has indicated that it would<br />\nsooner cancel the Fair than bring in Baltimore City police, and Security Chief<br />\nLarkin says that coordination problems<br />\nwould rule out hiring additional men from<br />\na private security agency. It would seem,<br />\nthen, that the first priority in reducing<br />\nviolence should be reducing the size of the<br />\ncrowd.<br />\nOf course, reducing crowd size<br />\nmeans changing the nature of the enterprise, and this brings us to the next problem inherent in the present scope of the<br />\nFair: it's too risky, and last year proved it.<br />\nOne day of rain and a truckful of melted<br />\nice cream, and the finances of this or that<br />\nstudent group go down the tubes. Too<br />\nmuch is riding on the Fair. and the circumstances of the Fair cannot be counted on to<br />\nsupport the weight. To answer the question<br />\nraised above, the Fair should be fun, first<br />\nand foremost, and not a commercial<br />\nboondoggle that can backfire in everyone's<br />\nface.<br />\nThis is not to say that the Fair can or<br />\nshould be limited to Hopkins students, or<br />\nmade into some sort of innocuous bazaar:<br />\nbut it should be geared to the enjoyment of<br />\nthe students, and eliminating rock music<br />\nruns directly counter to that purpose. If<br />\nthe Fair were less of a commercial enterprise, crowd sizes would be smaller, and<br />\nthen there would be no need to eliminate<br />\nrock 'n' roll . There would be less financial.<br />\nrisk all around, and everyone just might<br />\nhave a better time.<br />\nOf course, it would be unrealistic to<br />\nexpect the Fair to be scaled down this year,<br />\nor possibly even in the next few years. We<br />\nurge the committee, then, to reconsider the<br />\ncompromise position that it rejected before<br />\nbanning rock music during the day. At least<br />\nsome rock could be played during the day,<br />\nwith two- or three-hour breaks in between<br />\neach set. But don't take it all away. It's<br />\nonly rock 'n' roll, but we like it...<br />\n<br />\nProduction Staff<br />\nSuzanne Conklin<br />\nGranville Greene<br />\nMichael Lorton<br />\n<br />\nP.J.

This makes<br />\nthe last digit of the GPA largely<br />\nmeaningless, but students would<br />\nbe disadvantaged in graduate or<br />\nprofessional school applications<br />\nif the GPA were stated as merely<br />\n3.5. The additional information<br />\nwhich +/\u2014 grading provides will<br />\nalso aid the student in that it<br />\ngives more information about his<br />\nor her performance. A committee of admission in my experience will look more favorably on<br />\na candidate about whom they<br />\nhave more information. Incidentally, many of our peer<br />\ninstitutions have had +/\u2014 grading for a long time and several<br />\nothers have recently adopted it.<br />\nMy proposal was presented<br />\nto the C.U.S. more than two<br />\nyears ago. The committee had 5<br />\n/acuity and 4 student members.<br />\nAfter lung and detailed discussions which included presentations by members of the Student<br />\nCouncil, the proposal was unanimously adopted. The then president of the Student Council<br />\nand the chairman of the Education Committee objected and<br />\nasked for the committee to wait<br />\n<br />\nuntil a poll of student opinion<br />\ncould be taken before submitting the recommendation to the<br />\nAcademic Council. This was<br />\nagreed, the pull was taken, and<br />\nabout 60% of the relatively small<br />\nnumber of'students participating<br />\nstated a preference against +/\u2014<br />\ngrading. A typical question was:<br />\n\"Do you think +/\u2014 grading will<br />\nincrease grade competition?\"<br />\nThe following year the C.U.S.<br />\nagain considered +/\u2014 grading<br />\nprior to submitting its recommendation to the Academic<br />\nCouncil. This time it passed with<br />\ntwo negative votes. In the<br />\nmeantime the Ad Hoc Curriculum Review Committee had<br />\ncome out against +/\u2014 grading,<br />\nlargely at the insistence of the<br />\nStudent Council president who<br />\nwas a member. Because many of<br />\nthe recommendations of the<br />\nCurriculum Review Committee<br />\nwere controversial and opposed<br />\nby the academic departments,<br />\nthe report of the committee has<br />\nled to few changes in academic<br />\nprocedures.<br />\nNear the end of last year tn(<br />\nAcademic Council considered<br />\nthe C.U.S. recommendation and<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nThe Plusses, The Minuses, And The Questions<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nadded an A+ with a 4.3 grade<br />\npoint. I opposed this, but the<br />\nCouncil accepted it along with<br />\nthe C.U.S. recommendation. Recently, the Council rescinded the<br />\n4.3 grade 'point because of the<br />\nchanges it implied in the grade<br />\npoint base.<br />\nAs you can see, claims that<br />\nthis decision to implement a +/\u2014<br />\ngrading system is undemocratic<br />\nand that students have had no<br />\nvoice in the matter are incorrect.<br />\nAt another level I say that I am<br />\ndeeply concerned about students<br />\nand would not have proposed<br />\nthis system if I were not convinced, particularly after long<br />\ndiscussion with faculty and<br />\nstudents inside and outside the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, that this would benefit<br />\nstudents. It is a scheme long<br />\ntested elsewhere and one which,<br />\nin my opinion, deals well with<br />\nthe necessary evil of providing<br />\nsome evaluation of student performances. Of course, most<br />\npeople are nervous about being<br />\nevaluated, but this is a major<br />\nresponsibility of the faculty. My<br />\ncolleagues and I are greatly<br />\ninterested in student opinion<br />\nin this matter and have listened<br />\nto it carefully. We must, however, decide how best to carry<br />\nout our responsibilities if these<br />\nevaluations are to be meaningful.<br />\nI think that the News-Letter<br />\nmisinforms its readership when<br />\nit casts this question as a student<br />\nvs.administration issue. It is also<br />\nnot a matter to be settled by<br />\nreferendum in preference to the<br />\nlong considered work of the<br />\nC.U.S. where students are well<br />\nrepresented. I appreciate that<br />\napproximately .63 x .83 = 52%<br />\nof the student body voted in<br />\nfavor of retention of the present<br />\nsystem of grading. What I don't<br />\nknow is how thoughtful and<br />\ninformed the voters were about<br />\nthe questions at hand. I remind<br />\nyou that a number of polls in<br />\nrecent years have indicated that<br />\nsome or all of the Bill of Rights<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nWickwire<br />\nFire Burns<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nlegitimate gripe, though. Forums<br />\nrun by the Office of the Chaplain tend to be one-sided, rarely<br />\nincluding anybody to the right<br />\nof Ted Kennedy. While the<br />\nSunday Experience and similar<br />\nevents are often enjoyable and<br />\ninformative, they would be even<br />\nmore so if the participants<br />\ndisagreed once in a while. The<br />\nrecent appearance of the representative from the Moral Majority and last year's debate between leftist geography professor David Harvey and a real<br />\nestate developer are a good start;<br />\nmore should be done along those<br />\nlines.<br />\nInstead of insulting the<br />\nChaplain, the YAFers should<br />\nrequest his help in bringing in<br />\nspeakers with their point of view<br />\nand in organizing events.

To the Academic<br />\nCouncil, an informal survey,<br />\nwhich came out 60 to 40 percent against plus/ minus grading,<br />\nwas not an \"overwhelming<br />\nenough\" mandate to persuade it<br />\nto drop plans for the new<br />\nsystem. Now that the Academic<br />\nCouncil has what it wanted \u2014 a<br />\ntruly overwhelming turnout in a<br />\nformal referendum \u2014 Dean<br />\n,Hooker states (see News-Letter<br />\narticle entitled \"Students Reject<br />\nPlus/Minus Grading\" in the<br />\nOctober 23 issue) that he is<br />\n\"delighted\" at the largest turnout of students in years, if not<br />\nthe largest in Hopkins history;<br />\nhowever, the Academic Council<br />\nprobably will not change its<br />\ndecision because it feels that<br />\nplus/minus grading is best for<br />\nthe students. If the students had<br />\nbeen told this one month ago,<br />\nthen the referendum could have<br />\nbeen dispensed with. Everyone<br />\nwould have known then that the<br />\nwishes of the majority of students count for virtually noth\u2022<br />\ning, even though more than 50<br />\npercent of the entire student<br />\nbody made it known that they<br />\ndo not want plus/minus grading<br />\n(on an A=4.0, A-=3.7 scale).

It is not clear to me,<br />\nhowever, how you feel regarding<br />\nthis very important issue. As<br />\nDean of Undergraduate and<br />\nGraduate Studies, I see some of<br />\nthe final responsibility resting<br />\nwith you, and believe that your<br />\nconcerns would be well taken by<br />\nthe Academic Council.<br />\nThough I am sure you have<br />\nconsidered the options involved<br />\nin adoption of the new system,<br />\nallow me to express my major<br />\nconcerns. Firstly, the students<br />\nhave enrolled in this university<br />\nunder the present system. It is<br />\nboth unfair and unwise to<br />\nchange the rules in the middle of<br />\nthe game. Would not a better<br />\nand less objectionable solution<br />\nbe to start next year's freshman<br />\nclass under the new plan, thus<br />\nallowing those of us who are<br />\nstudying under the current grading system to graduate with one<br />\nset of standards reflected in our<br />\ngrades?<br />\nI'm sure you realize just<br />\nhow excessive student grade<br />\nanxiety can be at this university,<br />\nand I do not understand why the<br />\nAcademic Council would institute a procedure that would<br />\nincrease student grade appeals.<br />\nInstead of arguing over a limited<br />\nnumber of grade possibilities,<br />\nplus/minus grading will add a<br />\n<br />\nmultitude of possible adjustment<br />\nthat will be argued for. If the<br />\nfaculty and the administration<br />\nare looking for a grading method<br />\nwhich will decrease their current<br />\ndissatisfaction, this certainly<br />\nseems to be an odd choice.<br />\nFinally, as I'm sure you read<br />\n<br />\nin the editorial of this past<br />\nNews- Letter, it is apparent that<br />\nthe academic administration<br />\nmay be taking the students for a<br />\nride.

Ever since 1966<br />\nwhen Lyndon Johnson turned<br />\nhis attention from achieving<br />\nsocio-economic justice in America to subduing Vietnam, the<br />\nexecutive branch of our govern-<br />\n<br />\nThe Loop<br />\n<br />\nment has pursued anything but<br />\n\"liberal\" policies. Surely no one<br />\nwould argue that Nixon or<br />\nFord pursued liberal economic<br />\nor social policies. As for Jimmy<br />\nCarter, his adherence to Republican socio-economic doctrines was<br />\nmade plain by Senator Kennedy<br />\nduring the 1980 primaries.<br />\nInstead of liberalism being<br />\nthe cause of our problems, the<br />\nsocio-economic crisis which our<br />\ncountry now faces is much more<br />\nreasonably attributed to the<br />\nNixon-Ford-Carter conservative<br />\npolicies of fostering high interest<br />\nrates and unemployment to fight<br />\ninflation, allowing a bloated<br />\ndefense budget to sap needed<br />\nresources from the rest of our<br />\neconomy, and ignoring the basic<br />\nsocio-economic inequities which<br />\nare at the core of so many of our<br />\nnation's troubles.

I<br />\ncommend the Committee for<br />\ncompleting a difficult task effectively and efficiently. Their<br />\nrecommendations should greatly<br />\nimprove the safety of the<br />\nupcoming Fair. However, I believe that they stepped too<br />\nfar in recommending the banning of rock music.<br />\nTo begin with, their other<br />\nproposals lead me to believe that<br />\nrock should be permitted.

The decision is<br />\npuzzling because we (students,<br />\nalumni(ae), & the community)<br />\nhave been told almost nothing of<br />\nthe rationale for this decision. A<br />\nSophomore Class Representative<br />\ntells us that the decision is a<br />\nresponse to last year's problems<br />\nwith drunkenness. My response<br />\nto that statement is to ask what<br />\nproblem is she referring to? No<br />\nstatement of the specific problems which allegedly occurred<br />\nhas been given. So my frist<br />\nquestion is what happened?<br />\nSecondly, we know very<br />\nlittle about how the decision was<br />\nmade. What standard was used<br />\nto decide this matter? Surely,<br />\npeople get drunk every Spring<br />\nFair and live to fondly remember the occasions. What makes<br />\nlast year so different? In addition, why is music the focus of<br />\nthis decision? Common sense<br />\ntells us that alcohol causes<br />\ndrunkenness, not music.<br />\nThirdly, it is difficult to<br />\nfathom why the decision focuses<br />\nspecifically upon Rock Music.<br />\nThe supporting facts, whatever<br />\nthey are, must be fascinating if<br />\nthey can indicate such a direct<br />\nand clear correlation between<br />\nthe rock content of music and<br />\ndrunkenness (or whatever else<br />\nmay be alleged).

Little did I know, John Waters was<br />\nback in town.<br />\nFor the film-goer who has experienced John Waters' previous endeavors,<br />\nPolyester is no surprise. In fact, one<br />\nwonders if he hasn't gone a bit slack in<br />\nthe passing years (his last film, Desperate<br />\nLiving, premiered in 1977), for Polyester<br />\nlacks the extreme gore and violence of<br />\nMultiple Maniacs, Pink Flamingos, and<br />\nFemale Trouble (1970, 1972 and 1974<br />\nrespectively). However, for those who<br />\nhave never even heard of Waters, and who<br />\nmay be drawn to the new film via his<br />\n\"scent-sational\" promotional gimmick<br />\n\"Odorama,\" numerous reactions are<br />\npossible, the most prevalent being disgust.<br />\nPerhaps I should explain.<br />\nJohn Waters is a weird guy. Even<br />\nweird for Baltimore. What some might<br />\ncall a by-product of Charm City, Waters<br />\ndelights in the bizarre, the sleazy, the<br />\ndecayed. As he says in the first line of his<br />\nautobiography, Shock Value, \"To me,<br />\nbad taste is what entertainment is all<br />\nabout.\" This probably accounts for the<br />\nnumbers of people who walk out after<br />\n<br />\nthe first twenty minutes of the movie,<br />\nand for those who, after the first showing, disgustedly comment to the people<br />\nwaiting on line for the second, \"Don't<br />\nbother. It's really gross.\"<br />\nWaters' characters are obese<br />\nwomen who go shopping with their hair<br />\nup in bright pink curlers; men who wear<br />\nloud checked blazers with striped pants;<br />\nadolescents who unnerve their parents<br />\nwith the latest fads and unusual fetishes<br />\n\u2014 in other words, utterly tacky people.<br />\nPolyester is the gathering of these characters into Waters' archetypal middle-class<br />\nAmerican family, an all-star cast of<br />\nWaters regulars headed by Divine.<br />\n<br />\nDivine could use some explanation. For an innocent, it could take more<br />\nthan half of the movie to realize that<br />\nDivine \u2014 the matriarch-heroine of this<br />\nfamily in decay \u2014 is not a woman.<br />\nActually, he is a 300-pound man who, as<br />\nWaters puts it, \"is simply an actor who is<br />\nusually cast as a woman.\" Divine's screen<br />\n<br />\nEdith Massey in leather and lace<br />\n<br />\nBlitz: Chic Punks On Dromedaries<br />\nBY GEORGE YATCHISIN<br />\nPunk is dead. The word is out<br />\naround England, even though youths are<br />\nrioting just like the Clash said a few years<br />\nago. The new \"in\" fashion is the Blitz.<br />\nThe trendsetters of what's hip have given<br />\nup on the doom and gloom forecast of<br />\npunk, simply because it was too damn<br />\ndepressing. Why wear ripped t-shirts and<br />\nput safety pins through myself if nobody<br />\nreally cares? Violence may be the answer, but I don't enjoy getting beaten to<br />\na bloody pulp. So why not celebrate?<br />\nDress up, pretend everything's alright.<br />\nIt's surely not a better solution, but it is<br />\ninfinitely more fun.<br />\nThe Blitz is having fun. Taking its<br />\nname from the London club where the<br />\nfad began, the Blitz is not only lifestyle<br />\nand fashion, but more importantly,<br />\nmusic. It has defined the elusive \"new<br />\nromantic\" movement. David Bowie is the<br />\nsuperhero of the Blitz as he is the king of<br />\ndressing up. His poses are both famous<br />\nand infamous, but that's what a Blitz kid<br />\nwants to be. Garish, gaudy, wearing<br />\nmake-up. Brocaded, ruffled, silk slicked.<br />\nLife is a ball.<br />\nBut back to the important thing \u2014<br />\nthe music. The Blitz's roots lie deep in<br />\nEurodisco (what else?), for if you can't<br />\ndance to it it really doesn't matter. In a<br />\ntypical Blitz club one would hear, lots of<br />\nBowie, old Roxy Music, practically<br />\nanything associated with the Glitter<br />\nMovement.<br />\nThere are new groups too, not to<br />\nmention a few who converted to the<br />\nBlitz's bouncy beat. Perhaps the musical<br />\nleader of this new New Wave is Steve<br />\nStrange, a founder of the early Blitz clubs<br />\nand of Visage, one of the original Blitz<br />\ngroups. To typify the essence of the<br />\nmovement, Strange arrived at his first<br />\nU.S. press conference riding a camel.<br />\nLike I said, these people mean to have<br />\nfun.<br />\nClearly, there is an air of irresponsibility that underlies this fad. At times<br />\nthis notion sneaks into the music \u2014 it<br />\nmight sound good, you might want to<br />\n<br />\nmove your finely tailored outfit to it on<br />\nthe dance floor, but it gets awfully insipid<br />\non the home stereo. The Blitz lads don't<br />\ncare \u2014 this is social music \u2014 but then<br />\nagain, the only group to put out two<br />\n\"official\" Blitz albums so far, Ultravox,<br />\ngot a little more dark and serious the<br />\nsecond time out. Maybe the immature<br />\nwill grow up.<br />\nA sampling of Blitz albums:<br />\nAdam and the Ants. Kings of the<br />\nWild Frontier. What can one say about<br />\nAdam Ant? He's already a cult figure of<br />\nsorts for mixing American Indian and<br />\npirate influences to create music powered<br />\nby two drummers(this is the only similarity to the Doobies). All of the songs<br />\nhere don't really fit the Blitz, but one<br />\nwouldn't want them to. It's a horribly<br />\nproduced album and beyond \"Dog Eat<br />\nDog\" and \"Los Rancheros\" there isn't<br />\n<br />\nmuch to listen to. (I know \u2014 Antmusic\"<br />\nis an anthem, but that fails to make it<br />\ngood.) However, the group does the<br />\nfashion of the Blitz to the hilt, and gets<br />\npoints for publicizing the fad in the first<br />\nplace.<br />\nClassix Nouveaux. Classix Nouveaux. This is actually an impressive, if<br />\nvery weird, debut. Sal Solo, group leader,<br />\nlooks like a bald Dr. Spock with a vampire fixation, but he has created an album<br />\nwhere six out of eleven tracks are really<br />\ngood (and not just within the Blitz<br />\nmovement). Beware of soprano vocals<br />\nfrom this all-male quartet, not to mention<br />\nlots of synthesizer. Outstanding tracks<br />\nare \"Guilty,\" \"Every Home,\" \"Tokyo,\"<br />\nand an instrumental, \"623,\" that sounds<br />\neven better at 45 r.p.m.<br />\nJourneys to<br />\nSpandau Ballet.<br />\ncont. on p. 13<br />\n<br />\nlife is depicted partly through Odorama, a<br />\nscratch-and-sniff card that the wary<br />\nviewer cannot escape once he understands<br />\nWaters' use of the device \u2014 that is, to<br />\nhorrify the nose as much as the eyes.<br />\nYou might as well scratch anyway: even<br />\nif you don't, there are bound to be other<br />\nfools in the audience who won't learn<br />\nfrom their mistake (trust in Waters), and<br />\nthereby offend your nose as well as their<br />\nown.<br />\nDivine is rescued from a life<br />\nriddled with alcoholism and impending<br />\ndivorce by none other than Tab Hunter.<br />\nAs the Man In The White Car (a Corvette), Hunter has some marvelously<br />\nsteamy sex scenes with Divine, whom he<br />\nseduces with his still-fifties-ish good<br />\nlooks. What, the astute viewer may<br />\nwonder, does he see in this slob? Waters<br />\nobviously has something up his sleeve, as<br />\nthe film escalates from simpering romanticism to fine-tuned suspense.<br />\nNot to be missed is Edith Massey,<br />\n\"discovered\" by Waters in Baltimore's<br />\nown Fells Point. In a _switch from one of<br />\nher roles as the \"fag-hag\" in Female<br />\nTrouble where her, well, most interesting<br />\ncostume is a skintight S & M black leather<br />\nlace-up, Edie plays Cuddles, Divine's<br />\nrich girlfriend, who favors Lacoste shirts,<br />\nshort white tennis outfits, pink-and-green<br />\nprep-wear, and her chauffeur. Edie, it<br />\nshould be noted, probably weighs almost<br />\nas much as the taller Divine.<br />\nHave I scared you off'? I hope not.<br />\nAlthough the film is not for the truly<br />\nsqueamish, the Hopkins crowd could do<br />\nwith a little Waters excitement. Immersed in academics, we are often saturated with too much good taste. It lakes a<br />\nfilm like Polyester to bring us back to the<br />\nreal world.<br />\nTake this as a dare. Go see<br />\nPolyester at the Charles, 1711 North<br />\nCharles Street, Friday and Saturday at 8<br />\nand 12 p.m. If you survive, stay to see<br />\nPink Flamingos, in which the question,<br />\n\"Who deserves the title of Filthiest<br />\nPerson in the World?\" is answered \u2014<br />\nquite definitively \u2014 daily at 10 p.m., with<br />\na Saturday matinee at six. Be warned,<br />\nthough: some of you may find yourselves<br />\nslightly out of your element.<br />\n<br />\nRepulsion<br />\n<br />\nCracked Woman Staring At Cracks<br />\nBY WALTER HOOK<br />\nThis Sunday, Repulsion, directed<br />\nby Roman Polanski, will be playing in the<br />\nReel World. The film will be a treat for all<br />\nof you who enjoy feeling alienated.<br />\nRepulsion opens with lengthy<br />\nscenes of Catherine Deneuve, a beautiful<br />\nblonde woman, walking home from the<br />\nbeauty parlor where she works. She looks<br />\nnervous and uncomfortable when construction workers whistle and jeer at her.<br />\nThen Polanski lets us see her take most of<br />\nher clothes off, wash her legs, and lie on<br />\nher bed \u2014 scenes which Polanski no<br />\ndoubt enjoyed shooting. An unknown<br />\nman has fallen in love with her, and after<br />\nmanaging to land a date, tries to kiss her.<br />\nThe look on our heroine's face tells the<br />\nstory: repulsion.<br />\nMale viewers, like the unknown<br />\nsuitor, have been seduced by Deneuve's,<br />\nlooks. But at least some of us have doubts<br />\nabout the woman's mental capacity. We<br />\noften find her staring in revulsion at<br />\n<br />\nY-shaped cracks. When her sister leaves<br />\non vacation with her boyfriend, our<br />\nheroine begins to cook a rabbit, and after<br />\nsetting it on the coffee table, she forgets<br />\nall about it. The rotting carcass ornaments her living room for the rest of the<br />\nfilm.<br />\nThe more our heroine puts off her<br />\nsuitor, the more he's convinced of his<br />\nundying love for her. As in E.T.A. Hoffman's \"The Sandman,\" we begin to<br />\nwonder if the woman isn't an automaton.<br />\nThe only personality this woman seems<br />\nto have is her revulsion for men, and the<br />\npressure the predatory suitor puts on this<br />\nautomaton seems to be making it malfunction. She stops going to work, chops<br />\nup her phone cord, and boards up her<br />\nfront door. Meanwhile, the rabbit is still<br />\nrotting. As the decaying dinner seems to<br />\nrepresent her own mental decay, the walls<br />\nof her apartment, which begin surrealistically cracking, not only symbolize her<br />\ncrack, but her cracking up. Then imaginary suitors being raping her, and as her<br />\n<br />\nrepulsion for men grows, so does her<br />\nmadness.<br />\nThe film is simultaneously witty<br />\nand chilling, making the male viewer<br />\nwince at his own ability to be seduced by<br />\nsuch an automaton. (There is a theory<br />\nthat since most beautiful women are<br />\nrepulsed by aggressive suitors such as<br />\nRoman Polanski, he portrays this repulsion as a form of mental illness to soothe<br />\nhis bruised ego. This is simply untenable.) The emphasis on close-ups creates a<br />\nvery claustrophobic atmosphere, and the<br />\nnumerous scenes shot in all-white rooms<br />\ngive the film a dehumanized quality.<br />\nThough the acting is solid, particularly<br />\nDeneuve's thoroughly convincing portrayal of the dumb blonde, the pacing of<br />\nthe film is painfully slow. Despite the<br />\ncleverness of the film's concepts, too<br />\noften I found myself bored. The film is<br />\nvery rewarding intellectually, but its<br />\nclaustrophobic, dehumanizing atmosphere and slow pacing make it uncomfortable to sit through.<br />\n<br />\n\fnortun<br />\n<br />\nTilt<br />\nma<br />\nYou have been down to<br />\nPeabody for your weekly piccolo<br />\nlesson, and wearily you trudge back<br />\nto Homewood.

In addition,<br />\nthe Trio performed the Adagio from the<br />\nTrio in B Flat major, Op. 11 by Beethoven, as a memorial to Mary Bradley<br />\nMeyer, a longtime patron of the arts at<br />\nJohns Hopkins who died earlier this<br />\nmonth.<br />\nFor its encore, Beaux Arts<br />\nplayed a movement from the Dumky Trio<br />\nby Antonin Dvorak.<br />\nAlthough the musical proficiency<br />\nof the Beaux Arts Trio, who have performed together for a quarter of a century, is beyond question, the program<br />\n<br />\nwas disturbing. The excessively romantic<br />\nChausson, which opened the program,<br />\noverpowered the rest of the concert with<br />\nits bathos. The Mozart Trio right afterwards, in particular, was overwhelmed<br />\nby the Chausson, the contrast between<br />\nthe two being emphasized by the finesse<br />\nwith which the Trio played the Mozart as<br />\n'opposed to the overenthusiasm exhibited<br />\nduring the Chausson.<br />\nAlthough the Chausson piece was<br />\ninappropriate, this highly chromatic<br />\n<br />\nwork, written while Chausson was heavily<br />\ninfluenced by his teacher, Cesar Franck,<br />\nwas played. with the requisite bravado.<br />\nPianist Menahem Pressler was particularly<br />\nimpressive, especially the manner with<br />\nwhich he treated the Bambi-like Anime.<br />\nUnlike the Chausson, the Mozart<br />\nTrio was played too delicately. This<br />\ncomparatively late work, written in 1788,<br />\nthe year of the great \"Jupiter Symphony,\" is characterized by an emphasis<br />\non counterpoint often missing in Mozart's<br />\n<br />\nMore Junk For Well-DressedPunks<br />\ncont,from p. 9<br />\nGlory.

ELDRITCH<br />\n(Not Dan Vitale)<br />\nWell, I come into this smoky,<br />\nlow-ceilinged room looks sorta like an<br />\nEgyptian tomb \u2014 Jester's Place, I think<br />\nthey call it \u2014 and I plunk myself down<br />\ninto a seat and settle back to watch the<br />\nshow. First there's this homosexual gotta<br />\nglazed white expression on his face, he<br />\ncomes out and tells everybody to hurry<br />\n'up and sit down so's the show can start. I<br />\ndon't know, he looked kinda like Walter<br />\nHook, but he was talkin' like he had<br />\nmarbles in his mouth. Then it goes all<br />\ndark and we can hear this deep tropical<br />\nvoice singing about limes and cocoanuts,<br />\n<br />\nBeaux Arts'<br />\nmore youthful works.<br />\ninterpretation, however,seemed to reflect<br />\nthe manner of a younger, more aristocratic Mozart. But even the overrefinement did not masque the brilliance of the<br />\npiece.<br />\nThe Beaux Arts Trio lived up to<br />\nits reputation in the Schubert Trio,<br />\nhowever. The simple elegance of the<br />\nSchubert composition was perfectly conveyed, with class and character.<br />\n<br />\nand then the lights come on and we see<br />\nthese two guys, one's gotta guitar and the<br />\nother's sittin' behind a pianer. The<br />\nposters said these guys was called the<br />\nPage Boys, I think \u2014 yeah, Ed and Art<br />\nPage. They sang lotsa different songs<br />\nwhich I never found out the names of,<br />\nsome of 'em written by Gordon Footlights and others by Jethro Tool, and<br />\nsome by this guy name of O'Riginal.<br />\nThese last ones were all weird and crazylike, all about Greek cactuses and granola<br />\nsouffle and such like. I thought the<br />\nsongs by O'Riginal were really bizarre<br />\nand strange \u2014 especially this one which<br />\nsounded sorta like a ancient Mid-<br />\n<br />\nevil drinking song which they sang<br />\ntowards the end, where two more guys<br />\njumped up on stage with the Pages and<br />\nstarted shouting about severing skulls or<br />\nsomethin', so loud and fast till I didn't<br />\nknow what they was singin' about. After<br />\nthis, the two guys left and the Page Boys<br />\nsang a dumb song about eatin' they<br />\nbreakfasts (also by O'Riginal) and then<br />\nthe show was over. Well I'll tell you,<br />\nmy head was a'spinnin' by now, what<br />\nwith all this weird bazooka-music and<br />\neverything, so I just got up, had myself<br />\na few more beers, and high-tailed it outta<br />\nthere. I never did see no jester, neither.<br />\n<br />\nsynthesizer/violin/viola<br />\nplayer<br />\nBilly<br />\nCurrie are the heart of what's now a<br />\nquartet, and combine their rock sensibilities with that of that Blitz to set Ultravox<br />\napart.

Rage gets better with repeated listenings and contains one knockout<br />\npunch, \"I Remember (Death in the<br />\nAfternoon).\" Needless to say, the Joy<br />\nDivision side wins out in lyrics and song<br />\ntitles.<br />\nVisage. Visage. Don't get confused, but one of the songs is named<br />\n\"Visage\" and another \"Visa-age.\" Here<br />\nredundancy is the problem, although as<br />\ndance music, this is the Saturday Night<br />\nFever of the Blitz. Buy this one to dance<br />\nto, or to say group leader Steve Strange is<br />\nyour friend, or to listen to the superlative<br />\ncut \"Mind of a Toy\" repeatedly. Midge<br />\nUre and Billy Currie guest star, which is<br />\nprobably what makes this C+ effort<br />\nworth buying.<br />\n<br />\n-Nr.usiTop\u2022---W,M11..\"\"<br />\n<br />\nevv<br />\n<br />\nThe johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Band<br />\n<br />\n4vo<br />\n<br />\n+0<br />\n<br />\npresents its annual<br />\n<br />\nON%<br />\n<br />\n9\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAppearing<br />\nThursday Nights<br />\n<br />\nJ.<br />\n<br />\nPaul Trattner<br />\n<br />\n04 :4<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nThe Magician<br />\n<br />\nSYMPHONY No. 3<br />\n<br />\nWAGNER'S<br />\nRIENZI<br />\n<br />\nNovember 5, November 12<br />\n& November 19<br />\n9:00<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n,4k \u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe Wizardry of the Magician will amaze, astound, and<br />\namuse you.

What followed was an unprecedented<br />\nscreening process whereby Chief<br />\nOfficials of the Administration<br />\nattempted to decipher the Rock<br />\ncontent of proposed bands.<br />\nAlthough this process was rather<br />\nmysterious, it may have been<br />\nunsuccessful. Perhaps, the undergraduates who no doubt have<br />\nstereos, who listen to Rock<br />\nMusic on a regular basis, and<br />\nwho have appreciated its \"effect\" will have better success.<br />\nFourth, it is clear both from<br />\nthe 10/23/8 1 News-Letter article<br />\nand the Ad Hoc Committee's<br />\nletter to the Editor, that the<br />\nStudent Council has based its<br />\ndecision merely on the Committee's recommendations. The<br />\nCommittee's letter refers to a<br />\nReport which is forthcoming.<br />\nWhy has the Student Council<br />\nalready made its decision with-<br />\n<br />\nout first considering the Report'?<br />\nHow can the Council possibly<br />\nevaluate the basis for the Committee's recommendations without at least reviewing the facts<br />\nand reasons presented in the<br />\nReport? Why?<br />\nNot only am I puzzled by<br />\nthis decision, but I am, frankly,<br />\ndisturbed by it. As a freshman<br />\nwho witnessed the first Spring<br />\nFair in 1972, I am keenly aware<br />\nof the valuable role music has<br />\nplayed at the Fair. Fair originators empnasized music as a very<br />\nappropriate way to both celebrate the unique character of<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nand to allow the entire community to share in that celebration.<br />\nThe Fair's musical showcases<br />\nwith its 2 stages has always been<br />\na primary topic of conversation<br />\namong Fair goers, a major selling<br />\npoint to those getting acquainted with the Fair, and a favorite<br />\nStudents,<br />\nactivity.<br />\nFair<br />\n<br />\nalumni(ae) and others have enjoyed the opportunities to see<br />\nand hear their friends and<br />\nfamily perform. Musicians have<br />\nplayed for relatively small compensation to be a part of the<br />\ncelebration. The outdoor music<br />\nhas successfully embodied much<br />\nof the idealistic spirit of the<br />\nFair. Yet the Student Council<br />\nnow plans for the first time in<br />\nthe Fair's history to drastically<br />\nreduce the amount of music for<br />\nsome vague, unexplained reason.<br />\nIn addition, the openness of<br />\nthe decisionmaking process is<br />\nquestionable.<br />\nThe Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee's letter indicates that<br />\nthe Chief of Campus Security,<br />\nthe Administration, some members of last year's Spring Fair<br />\nBoard, and some student groups<br />\nwere given input into the decisionmaking process. Why were<br />\nnot members of the student<br />\nbody, graduate students, alumni(ae) and members of the<br />\n<br />\ncommunity given notice of this<br />\ninquiry and encouraged to participate? If the purpose of the<br />\ncommittee was to include proposing sweeping changes in the<br />\nrunning of the Fair, how could it<br />\nproperly perform this task without first considering the impact<br />\nof its recommendations upon all<br />\nFair participants'?<br />\nMy gut feeling about this<br />\nwhole matter, which is shared by<br />\nothers, is that the Administration, after having made extraordinary efforts to ensure the<br />\nsmooth running of the Fair each<br />\nyear, is suffering from battle<br />\nfatigue. As a result of its weariness with the whole enterprise,<br />\nthe Administration is now sending signals to the students to<br />\neliminate any possible source<br />\nof trouble which starts with T<br />\nwhich does not rhyme with M,<br />\nbut which means Music. It<br />\nappears that there are relatively<br />\nfew undergraduates around this<br />\n<br />\nplace anymore who are willing<br />\nand able to actively maintain the<br />\nvalue and tradition of the Fair<br />\nby showing that primary Fair<br />\nactivities, in general, and music,<br />\nin particular, are worth the<br />\ntrouble. I hope there is somebody around who will prove this<br />\njudgement incorrect.

The last is just<br />\na game, of course, sponsored by<br />\nHopSFA every year. It is called<br />\nthe Killer Game, and the president, John Harkness, a former<br />\nplayer, and Laury Hott, a<br />\nstudent at Hopkins, are running<br />\nthe unusual game this year. The<br />\ngame began this week, with<br />\nabout 35 people participating.<br />\nStudents from all classes<br />\nmay take part in the contest,<br />\nwhich consists of chosen \"killers\" shooting their assigned<br />\n\"victims\" with rubber-tipped<br />\ndart guns. The killer is assigned<br />\none victim at first, and if he kills<br />\nhis victim within two weeks, he<br />\nis immediately given another.<br />\nThis goes on until all of the<br />\nkillers, of which there can be<br />\nany number, kill their victims \u2014<br />\nand each other \u2014 and there is<br />\nonly one person left ... the<br />\nwinner. This winner's prize is<br />\nthe satisfaction of knowing he<br />\nkilled everyone.<br />\nThe other<br />\nplayers gain some satisfaction,<br />\ntoo, of having fun and temporarily turning their minds away<br />\nfrom schoolwork.<br />\nAccording to Hott, the<br />\ngame from last year is still going<br />\non, though it was only supposed<br />\nto last for two weeks. Her<br />\nreason for this is that it went<br />\nfast at first, and then \"it got<br />\nsneaky.\" This was true for all<br />\nthree of the previous games(two<br />\nofficial games and one unofficial<br />\none).<br />\nSome of the victims<br />\nbecame<br />\nespecially<br />\ncautious<br />\naboia killers \u2014 they made sure<br />\nthey had many friends with<br />\nthem at all times, among other<br />\nthings.<br />\n<br />\nCould this mean that the<br />\ngame is taken too seriously by<br />\nthe players? A few think so.<br />\nHott had a visiting roommate<br />\nlast year who thought that the<br />\ngame was being carried too far<br />\nby extremely enthusiastic participants. But evidently, almost<br />\neveryone else feels differently,<br />\nfor the whole senior class played<br />\nlast year. A former student of<br />\nHopkins said it is a great game<br />\nwhich \"keeps people out of<br />\ntrouble.\" He has played in all<br />\nthe previous contests.<br />\nLike other games. Killer has<br />\nits rules. First of all, there can<br />\nonly be one witness when<br />\nyou kill someone or are killed,<br />\nso you can't jump up in the<br />\nmiddle of class and aim your<br />\ndart gun at your victim. Aiming<br />\nbrings about another rule: no<br />\nhead shots. If you are caught<br />\nshooting someone in the head<br />\narea two times, you are out of<br />\nthe game. No other weapon can<br />\nbe used but a dart gun or rifle<br />\nwith rubber-tipped darts, The<br />\nvictim is not to be informed of<br />\nhis killer: he will know in time,<br />\nbecause before he can shoot, the<br />\n<br />\nmurderer must say, \"I am<br />\nyour killer.- But there are two<br />\nchances for the victim to escape<br />\ndeath.<br />\nAfter the murderer<br />\nhas announced his identity, the<br />\nvictim has the opportunity to<br />\nshoot his killer if his killer<br />\nis too slow to fire the dart gun.<br />\nAlso, the killer and victim<br />\nmay sign a truce, agreeing not to<br />\nmurder each other. This isn't<br />\nmuch of a relief, though, for if<br />\none leaves the other's sight for<br />\nfive minutes, the truce is off.<br />\nYou may kill as many<br />\nvictims as you are assigned, but<br />\nyou cannot have a roommate for<br />\na killer or a victim. And each<br />\nkilling must be written out with<br />\nboth the killer's and the victim's<br />\nsignatures. So the game is not as<br />\neasy as it sounds.<br />\nThe only problem, according to Hott, occurs when students who do not live on or near<br />\nthe campus want to be in the<br />\ngame. \"Then they have to make<br />\nspecial trips to the campus to<br />\nkill someone,\" she explained.<br />\nOther than that, the Killer Game<br />\nruns without major mishap each<br />\nyear.<br />\n<br />\nPractice makes perfect.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 17<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Shoots' For MAC Title<br />\n<br />\nFencers Sharpen Blades For The Coming Season<br />\nBY ANDREW WOLFE<br />\n<br />\ntradition with tournament vic- but they have to be ready to Usually they don't make it here;<br />\ntories this season by junior Tim work before they can compete.\" the JVs surpass them in only a<br />\nD'Artagnan would shudder Hsieh, 35-26 last year, in sabre<br />\nThis unique program of few weeks.

It was the second largest<br />\nSymposium audience of the<br />\nyear; Stephen Thernstrom's address attracted between 150 and<br /><br />\nPatterson, Novak Express Views<br />\nOn American Melting Pot Theory<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nrequires that the individual make<br />\na conscious effort to acquaint<br />\nhimself with his ethnicity. This<br />\nmay take the form of intellectual inquiry or participation in<br />\nsocial groups.<br />\nPatterson denied the existence of an \"ethnic instinct.\"<br />\nInstead the Jamaican-born sociologist focused on ethnicity as a<br />\n\"strategy of action, a way to<br />\nmobilize groups.\" It is \"not a<br />\nprimeval urge.., people choose<br />\nand are aware of choice. What is<br />\nimportant is that people believe<br />\nin [these] groups.\"<br />\n\"Ethnic strategies\" are used<br />\ntrying to enter the<br />\noutsiders<br />\nby<br />\nAmerican system, according to<br />\nPatterson. The strategy may be<br />\neither inclusive or exclusive. The<br />\ninclusive method is by definition<br />\ntemporary; integration is its<br />\ngoal. The group bands together<br />\nto give its members power but<br />\n\"ultimate success implies the<br />\nend of the group.\" This is \"not<br />\nto say they passively give in to<br />\nconformity,\" Patterson added.<br />\n\"The struggle will change both<br />\nthe group and the dominant<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nThe exclusive model emphasizes cultural differences. The<br />\nexistence of the group is permanent; they define themselves as<br />\ndistinct internally and seek a<br /><br />\n\"symbiotic relationship\" within<br />\nAmerican culture.<br />\nNovak admitted the existence of the use of ethnicity as a<br />\nsocial or political strategy but<br />\nfelt that this use had largely<br />\nbeen excluded in the United<br />\nStates. He was the \"politicization\" of ethnicity as being much<br />\nmore prevalent in Canada.<br />\nPortes characterized Novak's views as \"somewhat opinionated and rosy...emphasizing<br />\nfreedom.\" Novak had said that<br />\nour \"common culture allows<br /><br />\nMichael Novak<br /><br />\nroom for many different cultures.\" He felt that while \"all<br />\nethnic groups have the feeling of<br />\nnot belonging,\" there is enough<br />\nopportunity in the U.S. to<br />\nassimilate everyone. He did<br />\nallow that \"many of the most<br />\nsuccessful are successful by<br />\nforgetting ethnicity, following<br />\ntheir own desires and instincts.<br />\nthey<br />\ngo<br />\nCharacteristically<br />\nthrough a wrenching split with<br />\nfamily, ethnic group.\"<br />\nPatterson addressed a similar theme in his criticism of the<br />\n\"ethnic revival\" which he described as \"divisive...a diversion<br />\nthat emphasizes the wrong kinds<br />\nof group.\" He thought that this<br />\n\"romantic revolt\" could be both<br />\n\"anti-American\" and \"antiindividualistic,\" that people had<br />\nlost sight of their ultimate<br />\nobjective of Americanization<br />\nand shifted towards an \"exclusive type.\"<br />\nThe two-and-a-half hour<br />\nsymposium<br />\nwith<br />\nconcluded<br />\nquestions from the audience and<br />\na short reception with the<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nThis Monday night Nathan<br />\nGlazer, professor of education<br />\nand sociology at Harvard University, will speak on the topic,<br />\n\"The Presidency of Ethnicity:<br />\nJewish Immigration to the<br />\nUnited States.\"<br /><br />\nSecurity Worries Spur Decision<br />\nTo Ban Music From Spring Fair<br />\nwilt,from p. 1<br />\nall the acts of vandalism are<br />\ncaused by these non-students,\"<br />\nsaid Larkin. \"We've had minimal<br />\ntrouble in the lower quad,<br />\nwhere the steel band, Hopkins'<br />\norchestra, and country bands<br />\nperformed, and no trouble at all<br />\nin the Decker Gardens, where<br />\nthe dancers were. In the past,<br />\nmost all of the trouble occurred<br />\nin the Gilman quad, where the<br />\nrock bands played.\" He feels<br />\nthat if rock music is stopped, the<br />\nrowdy crowds will disperse, and<br />\nmany of the problems will be<br />\nsolved.<br />\n\"As an administrator closely<br />\nrelated to the Fair, I very<br />\nstrongly recommend that rock<br />\nmusic be stopped during the<br />\nday,\" said Colombo. Colombo's<br />\ngreatest concern is that rock<br />\nmusic may draw an uncontrollable crowd to campus. He feels<br />\nthat the redefinition of the<br />\nlength and type of live musical<br />\nentertainment is necessary. \"I<br />\ndon't think that its (rock music's) absence will eliminate the<br />\nundesirables the first year, be-<br /><br />\ncause they won't all know about<br />\nit, but it's a step in the right<br />\ndirection,\" he explained.<br />\nLarry Wolfe, coordinator of<br />\nmusic and concerts for the 1981<br />\nFair and a member of the Ad<br />\nHoc Committee, argued that the<br />\nfaculty and administration consider the safety of the students<br />\nto be more important than any<br />\nfair. \"Unfortunately, if we continue the format of continuous<br />\nmusic, odds are that we'll have<br />\nproblems which the faculty,<br />\nadministration and security will<br />\ndisapprove of,\" he said.<br />\nAll those voting in favor of<br />\nbanning daytime rock music<br />\nhope that this year the unwelcome individuals will find the<br />\nmusic contrary to what they<br />\nexpected, and will leave. \"If we<br />\ngive them any rock music at all,<br />\nthey'll hang out and hope for<br />\nmore,\" Wolfe explained. \"Students can appreciate diversity.<br />\nLet's bore the non-students to<br />\ndeath with culture.\"<br />\n\"The alternative plan to<br />\nhave two hours of live music<br />\nfollowed by two hours of filler<br /><br />\nprogramming is a terrific opportunity for the SAC groups to<br />\nperform,\" said Junior Class<br />\npresident Chris Hampton, the<br />\nchairman of the Ad Hoc Committee. \"These groups \u2014 the jazz<br />\nband, glee club, and Barnstormers \u2014 go to Hopkins and should<br />\nbe given the chance to show off<br />\ntheir talents at the festival.\"<br />\nBoth he and Wolfe are<br />\namong those who would personally appreciate the rock music<br />\nperformances throughout the<br />\nday, but they emphasized that<br />\nthere are eight locations where<br />\nrock concerts may be held at<br />\nnight indoors with admission<br />\ncontrolled, for the enjoyment of<br />\nthe Hopkins community.\"Hopefully, this way will be the best of<br />\ncommented<br />\nworlds,\"<br />\nboth<br />\nHampton.<br />\nAdvertising for the Fair will<br />\nbe designed to change the image<br />\n\"from a blow-out party to a<br />\nUniversity celebration,\" said<br />\nHampton. Publicity will emphasize the display of the University<br />\ntalents.<br /><br />\n200 people. So far, this year's<br />\ncrowds, which have averaged<br />\nabout 100 people per night, are<br />\nfar below last year's audiences.<br />\nMany students feel less<br />\ninclined to attend the Symposium this year because of the<br />\nlack of \"big name\" speakers.<br />\npresident<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nChuck Peifer explained,\"It's not<br />\na symposium to attract the<br />\nmasses. There are no famous<br />\npeople,.no TV personalities or<br />\nnews reporters. If you want to<br />\nhave a serious symposium you<br />\nhave to take the risk of having<br />\nonly 100 people show up.\"<br />\nPeifer added that when the<br />\nSymposium topic was chosen, he<br />\nknew it would not draw spectacularly, but it was picked because<br />\nit was the best subject.<br />\nEthan Kent, a senior who<br />\nhas attended two lectures this<br />\nyear, explained, \"You're not<br />\ngetting bona fide celebrities like<br />\nJohn Anderson. No, you get<br />\nOrlando Patterson. Who knows<br />\nOrlando Patterson?\"<br />\nExpressing a similar view,<br />\nsenior Paul Marra commented,<br />\n\"I'm enjoying the Symposium<br />\nless this year. It's more like<br />\ngoing to class. Last year they<br />\ngot bigger names and it made<br />\nfor a more enjoyable evening.\"<br /><br />\nco-chairman<br />\nSymposium<br />\nDavid Kaplan admitted that he<br />\nwas upset at the size of the<br />\naudiences, but he emphasized<br />\nthat the organizers' intention<br />\nwas to strive for \"competence\"<br />\nand not big names. Kaplan is<br />\nhopeful, however, that the<br />\ncrowds will pick up in November<br />\nwhen more well-known speakers<br />\nsuch as Jerzy Kosinski and Rev.<br />\nTheodore Hesburgh will appear.<br />\nOne consolation for the<br />\norganizers is that the size of the<br />\naudiences bears no relationship<br />\nto the Symposium's finances.<br />\nBefore the Symposium begins,<br />\nthe Student Council and local<br />\nbusinesses such as Black and<br />\nDecker and Equitable Trust<br />\ndonate funds to the Symposium.<br />\nThis year's Symposium has received more money than any<br />\nprevious one.<br />\nDespite the small audiences,<br />\nthere are students who continue<br />\nto attend the talks regularly.<br />\nStuart McConnell, a graduate<br />\nstudent in the History Department, has attended all but one<br />\nevent. \"The quality of speakers<br />\ntends to be very good,\" he<br />\ncommented.<br />\nAnother student who has<br />\nattended almost all of this year's<br />\nlectures remarked,\"I only go for<br />\nthe food.\"<br /><br />\nSC Lobbies Against<br />\nPlus/Minus Grading<br />\nBY LINDA MCINTYRE<br />\nSince last week's referendum vote on plus/minus grading,<br />\nmany students have been wondering what the next step will<br />\nbe. The Student Council is<br />\ncurrently working out its strategy for the next phase in the<br />\ndebate.<br />\nAccording to Student Council president Chuck Peifer, the<br />\noverwhelming \"no\" vote in last<br />\nweek's balloting served to firm<br />\nup the Council's position on the<br />\nissue. \"The vote last week<br />\nrubber-stamped our position on<br />\nthe issue,\" he said. \"We have<br />\ndecided to officially oppose the<br />\nplus/minus grading system.\"<br />\nPresident Steven Muller in<br />\nan address to freshmen Wednesday night said that he felt<br />\nplus/minus grading would be \"a<br />\ngreat disservice to undergraduates.\" He added, however, that<br />\nhe is unable to do much to<br />\nchange the policy; that, he said,<br />\nis up to the Academic Council.<br /><br />\nPeifer, along with Education<br />\nDoug<br />\nCommittee Chairman<br />\nFellman, plans to visit members<br />\nof the Academic Council, the<br />\ngroup of faculty members elected by their peers, who initiated<br />\nthe proposal, to discuss their<br />\nposition on the matter. Some of<br />\nthe members have already talked<br />\nwith Peifer and Fellman and,<br />\naccording to Fellman, \"the faculty is being very receptive to<br />\nstudent input.\"<br />\nThe Student Council also<br />\nhopes to be put on the agenda<br />\nfor the next Academic Council<br />\nmeeting, which will be held<br />\nsometime next month.<br />\nAs it stands now, it no<br />\nchange is made in the current<br />\nAcademic Council policy the<br />\ngrading system will change to a<br />\nplus/minus system in September<br />\n1982. Although there would be<br />\nan A+, it would be an honorary<br />\ngrade appearing only on transcripts. For purposes of the<br />\nGPA, the A+ would count as<br />\n4.0.<br /><br />\nNOW Sponsors Walk<br />\nFor Passage Of ERA<br />\nBY PETER YAROSCHUK<br />\nThe National Organization<br />\nfor Women (NOW) staged a<br />\nWalk -a,Thon last Saturday for<br />\nthe benefit of the ERA.

Most of us like rock and roll<br />\n- it seems to have gained something of a<br />\nfollowing over the last few decades.<br />\nBut the committee's decision, howunpopular<br />\nit may prove, was not a<br />\never<br />\nkneejerk reaction. There have been an<br />\nincreasing number of violent incidents at<br />\nthe Fair during the last few years. A<br />\nlengthy report by the committee documents the opinions of a number of knowledgeable people (including Major Robert<br />\nLarkin, Chief of Security) that the elimination of rock music would substantially<br />\nreduce the potential for violence at the<br />\nFair.<br />\nSo, keeping in mind that the committee is not a group of Montiverdi-loving<br />\nnerds, we must look at the larger issue that<br />\nthey themselves addressed in making their<br />\ndecision: namely, what is the purpose of<br />\nthe Fair? Is it to make money or to have<br />\nfun? Fun, of course; and it should be<br />\npossible to have fun, safely, without<br />\nbanning the devil rock 'n' roll.<br />\nLook at it this way: the Fair is<br />\nperhaps the major non-academic event of<br />\nthe year. Within a space of three days,<br />\nsomething close to 150,000 people come<br />\ntromping across the Homewood campus.<br />\nThe money they spend makes possible<br />\nsome of the most attractive features of the<br />\nFair. such as the big-name performers like<br />\nMartin Mull; it makes up a large part of<br />\nmany student activity group budgets: and it<br />\ncontributes several thousand dollars to the<br />\nSAC emergency fund.<br />\nAn event of this magnitude is bound<br />\nhave<br />\nproblems on the same scale. First<br />\nto<br />\nis that the Campus Security<br />\nlist<br />\nthe<br />\non<br />\npolice, no matter how dedicated and<br />\ncompetent they may be, numbers only 14.<br />\nThis is less than one one-hundredth of a<br />\npercent of the size of the crowd they have<br /><br />\nto deal with over the three-day period. The<br />\nAdministration has indicated that it would<br />\nsooner cancel the Fair than bring in Baltimore City police, and Security Chief<br />\nLarkin says that coordination problems<br />\nwould rule out hiring additional men from<br />\na private security agency. It would seem,<br />\nthen, that the first priority in reducing<br />\nviolence should be reducing the size of the<br />\ncrowd.<br />\nOf course, reducing crowd size<br />\nmeans changing the nature of the enterprise, and this brings us to the next problem inherent in the present scope of the<br />\nFair: it's too risky, and last year proved it.<br />\nOne day of rain and a truckful of melted<br />\nice cream, and the finances of this or that<br />\nstudent group go down the tubes. Too<br />\nmuch is riding on the Fair. and the circumstances of the Fair cannot be counted on to<br />\nsupport the weight. To answer the question<br />\nraised above, the Fair should be fun, first<br />\nand foremost, and not a commercial<br />\nboondoggle that can backfire in everyone's<br />\nface.<br />\nThis is not to say that the Fair can or<br />\nshould be limited to Hopkins students, or<br />\nmade into some sort of innocuous bazaar:<br />\nbut it should be geared to the enjoyment of<br />\nthe students, and eliminating rock music<br />\nruns directly counter to that purpose. If<br />\nthe Fair were less of a commercial enterprise, crowd sizes would be smaller, and<br />\nthen there would be no need to eliminate<br />\nrock 'n' roll . There would be less financial.<br />\nrisk all around, and everyone just might<br />\nhave a better time.<br />\nOf course, it would be unrealistic to<br />\nexpect the Fair to be scaled down this year,<br />\nor possibly even in the next few years. We<br />\nurge the committee, then, to reconsider the<br />\ncompromise position that it rejected before<br />\nbanning rock music during the day. At least<br />\nsome rock could be played during the day,<br />\nwith two- or three-hour breaks in between<br />\neach set. But don't take it all away. It's<br />\nonly rock 'n' roll, but we like it...<br /><br />\nProduction Staff<br />\nSuzanne Conklin<br />\nGranville Greene<br />\nMichael Lorton<br /><br />\nP.J.

The committee had 5<br />\n/acuity and 4 student members.<br />\nAfter lung and detailed discussions which included presentations by members of the Student<br />\nCouncil, the proposal was unanimously adopted. The then president of the Student Council<br />\nand the chairman of the Education Committee objected and<br />\nasked for the committee to wait<br /><br />\nuntil a poll of student opinion<br />\ncould be taken before submitting the recommendation to the<br />\nAcademic Council. This was<br />\nagreed, the pull was taken, and<br />\nabout 60% of the relatively small<br />\nnumber of'students participating<br />\nstated a preference against +/\u2014<br />\ngrading. A typical question was:<br />\n\"Do you think +/\u2014 grading will<br />\nincrease grade competition?\"<br />\nThe following year the C.U.S.<br />\nagain considered +/\u2014 grading<br />\nprior to submitting its recommendation to the Academic<br />\nCouncil. This time it passed with<br />\ntwo negative votes. In the<br />\nmeantime the Ad Hoc Curriculum Review Committee had<br />\ncome out against +/\u2014 grading,<br />\nlargely at the insistence of the<br />\nStudent Council president who<br />\nwas a member. Because many of<br />\nthe recommendations of the<br />\nCurriculum Review Committee<br />\nwere controversial and opposed<br />\nby the academic departments,<br />\nthe report of the committee has<br />\nled to few changes in academic<br />\nprocedures.<br />\nNear the end of last year tn(<br />\nAcademic Council considered<br />\nthe C.U.S. recommendation and<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nThe Plusses, The Minuses, And The Questions<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nadded an A+ with a 4.3 grade<br />\npoint. I opposed this, but the<br />\nCouncil accepted it along with<br />\nthe C.U.S. recommendation. Recently, the Council rescinded the<br />\n4.3 grade 'point because of the<br />\nchanges it implied in the grade<br />\npoint base.<br />\nAs you can see, claims that<br />\nthis decision to implement a +/\u2014<br />\ngrading system is undemocratic<br />\nand that students have had no<br />\nvoice in the matter are incorrect.<br />\nAt another level I say that I am<br />\ndeeply concerned about students<br />\nand would not have proposed<br />\nthis system if I were not convinced, particularly after long<br />\ndiscussion with faculty and<br />\nstudents inside and outside the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, that this would benefit<br />\nstudents. It is a scheme long<br />\ntested elsewhere and one which,<br />\nin my opinion, deals well with<br />\nthe necessary evil of providing<br />\nsome evaluation of student performances. Of course, most<br />\npeople are nervous about being<br />\nevaluated, but this is a major<br />\nresponsibility of the faculty. My<br />\ncolleagues and I are greatly<br />\ninterested in student opinion<br />\nin this matter and have listened<br />\nto it carefully. We must, however, decide how best to carry<br />\nout our responsibilities if these<br />\nevaluations are to be meaningful.<br />\nI think that the News-Letter<br />\nmisinforms its readership when<br />\nit casts this question as a student<br />\nvs.administration issue. It is also<br />\nnot a matter to be settled by<br />\nreferendum in preference to the<br />\nlong considered work of the<br />\nC.U.S. where students are well<br />\nrepresented. I appreciate that<br />\napproximately .63 x .83 = 52%<br />\nof the student body voted in<br />\nfavor of retention of the present<br />\nsystem of grading. What I don't<br />\nknow is how thoughtful and<br />\ninformed the voters were about<br />\nthe questions at hand. I remind<br />\nyou that a number of polls in<br />\nrecent years have indicated that<br />\nsome or all of the Bill of Rights<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nWickwire<br />\nFire Burns<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nlegitimate gripe, though. Forums<br />\nrun by the Office of the Chaplain tend to be one-sided, rarely<br />\nincluding anybody to the right<br />\nof Ted Kennedy. While the<br />\nSunday Experience and similar<br />\nevents are often enjoyable and<br />\ninformative, they would be even<br />\nmore so if the participants<br />\ndisagreed once in a while. The<br />\nrecent appearance of the representative from the Moral Majority and last year's debate between leftist geography professor David Harvey and a real<br />\nestate developer are a good start;<br />\nmore should be done along those<br />\nlines.<br />\nInstead of insulting the<br />\nChaplain, the YAFers should<br />\nrequest his help in bringing in<br />\nspeakers with their point of view<br />\nand in organizing events.

It is ironic that the<br />\nwishes of the students are not<br />\nreferendum. The academic gov- held in higher regard at a univerernance of the University allows sity which prides itself on the<br />\nstudents to be heard and they independence and leeway of<br />\nare heard.

Jones<br />\nChairman<br />\nThe Elections Commission<br /><br />\nWe Said No<br /><br />\nEt Tu, Dean Hooker?<br /><br />\nTO the Editor:<br /><br />\nDear Dean Hooker:<br /><br />\nIn previous News-Letter articles, Dean Hooker and the<br />\nAcademic Council were represented as supporting plus/minus<br />\ngrading because the students<br />\nwanted it. To the Academic<br />\nCouncil, an informal survey,<br />\nwhich came out 60 to 40 percent against plus/ minus grading,<br />\nwas not an \"overwhelming<br />\nenough\" mandate to persuade it<br />\nto drop plans for the new<br />\nsystem. Now that the Academic<br />\nCouncil has what it wanted \u2014 a<br />\ntruly overwhelming turnout in a<br />\nformal referendum \u2014 Dean<br />\n,Hooker states (see News-Letter<br />\narticle entitled \"Students Reject<br />\nPlus/Minus Grading\" in the<br />\nOctober 23 issue) that he is<br />\n\"delighted\" at the largest turnout of students in years, if not<br />\nthe largest in Hopkins history;<br />\nhowever, the Academic Council<br />\nprobably will not change its<br />\ndecision because it feels that<br />\nplus/minus grading is best for<br />\nthe students. If the students had<br />\nbeen told this one month ago,<br />\nthen the referendum could have<br />\nbeen dispensed with. Everyone<br />\nwould have known then that the<br />\nwishes of the majority of students count for virtually noth\u2022<br />\ning, even though more than 50<br />\npercent of the entire student<br />\nbody made it known that they<br />\ndo not want plus/minus grading<br />\n(on an A=4.0, A-=3.7 scale). If<br />\nthe 37 percent of the student<br />\nbody that did not vote had<br /><br />\nI read with great dismay<br />\nyour comments regarding the<br />\neffectiveness of this past week's<br />\nstudent referendum on plus/minus grading. It is not clear to me,<br />\nhowever, how you feel regarding<br />\nthis very important issue. As<br />\nDean of Undergraduate and<br />\nGraduate Studies, I see some of<br />\nthe final responsibility resting<br />\nwith you, and believe that your<br />\nconcerns would be well taken by<br />\nthe Academic Council.<br />\nThough I am sure you have<br />\nconsidered the options involved<br />\nin adoption of the new system,<br />\nallow me to express my major<br />\nconcerns. Firstly, the students<br />\nhave enrolled in this university<br />\nunder the present system. It is<br />\nboth unfair and unwise to<br />\nchange the rules in the middle of<br />\nthe game. Would not a better<br />\nand less objectionable solution<br />\nbe to start next year's freshman<br />\nclass under the new plan, thus<br />\nallowing those of us who are<br />\nstudying under the current grading system to graduate with one<br />\nset of standards reflected in our<br />\ngrades?<br />\nI'm sure you realize just<br />\nhow excessive student grade<br />\nanxiety can be at this university,<br />\nand I do not understand why the<br />\nAcademic Council would institute a procedure that would<br />\nincrease student grade appeals.<br />\nInstead of arguing over a limited<br />\nnumber of grade possibilities,<br />\nplus/minus grading will add a<br /><br />\nmultitude of possible adjustment<br />\nthat will be argued for. If the<br />\nfaculty and the administration<br />\nare looking for a grading method<br />\nwhich will decrease their current<br />\ndissatisfaction, this certainly<br />\nseems to be an odd choice.<br />\nFinally, as I'm sure you read<br /><br />\nin the editorial of this past<br />\nNews- Letter, it is apparent that<br />\nthe academic administration<br />\nmay be taking the students for a<br />\nride. No longer can the excuse<br />\nbe made that a majority of the<br />\nstudent body has not expressed<br />\ncont. On p. 7<br /><br />\nThe Outside World<br />\nL<br /><br />\niberalism Lives<br /><br />\nBY VINCENT DEMARCO<br /><br />\nLast year's election of<br />\nRonald Reagan, combined as it<br />\nwas with the defeat of several<br />\nliberal Democratic Senators,<br />\ncaused great concern among<br />\nliberals across the country.<br />\nMany of them, having at least<br />\nReagan's<br />\naccepted<br />\npartially<br />\nclaim that liberalism in its<br />\npresent form has failed and<br />\nbeing convinced that the 1980<br />\nelection was in large part a<br />\nrejection of traditional liberalism, have called for a \"reassessment\" of liberal policies and the<br />\ncreation of a \"new\" (apparently<br />\nmore conservative) liberalism.<br />\nAlthough liberals should always<br />\nbe prepared to \"reassess\" their<br />\npositions and policies in light of<br />\nchanging circumstances and conditions, it would be both totally<br />\nunwarranted and extremely<br />\nharmful for liberals to respond<br />\nto Reagan's election by moving<br />\nto the right.<br />\nThe argument that liberalism should be reassessed because<br />\nits failure has led to our present<br />\neconomic woes is easily refuted<br />\nby the fact that liberal policies<br />\nwere never given a chance to<br />\nsucceed or fail. Ever since 1966<br />\nwhen Lyndon Johnson turned<br />\nhis attention from achieving<br />\nsocio-economic justice in America to subduing Vietnam, the<br />\nexecutive branch of our govern-<br /><br />\nThe Loop<br /><br />\nment has pursued anything but<br />\n\"liberal\" policies. Surely no one<br />\nwould argue that Nixon or<br />\nFord pursued liberal economic<br />\nor social policies. As for Jimmy<br />\nCarter, his adherence to Republican socio-economic doctrines was<br />\nmade plain by Senator Kennedy<br />\nduring the 1980 primaries.<br />\nInstead of liberalism being<br />\nthe cause of our problems, the<br />\nsocio-economic crisis which our<br />\ncountry now faces is much more<br />\nreasonably attributed to the<br />\nNixon-Ford-Carter conservative<br />\npolicies of fostering high interest<br />\nrates and unemployment to fight<br />\ninflation, allowing a bloated<br />\ndefense budget to sap needed<br />\nresources from the rest of our<br />\neconomy, and ignoring the basic<br />\nsocio-economic inequities which<br />\nare at the core of so many of our<br />\nnation's troubles. Far from being<br />\nresponsible for these disastrous<br />\npolicies, liberals strenuously,<br />\nthough unsuccessfully, opposed<br />\nthem.<br />\nIt is true that during the<br />\nNixon-Ford-Carter years liberals<br />\nheld positions of great influence<br />\nin Congress and were able.<br />\nsometimes over Presidential<br />\nvetoes, to enact some very<br />\nimportant social welfare legislaThey were, however.<br />\ntion.<br />\nvery far from being able to set<br />\nthe national agenda.

The decision is<br />\npuzzling because we (students,<br />\nalumni(ae), &amp; the community)<br />\nhave been told almost nothing of<br />\nthe rationale for this decision. A<br />\nSophomore Class Representative<br />\ntells us that the decision is a<br />\nresponse to last year's problems<br />\nwith drunkenness. My response<br />\nto that statement is to ask what<br />\nproblem is she referring to? No<br />\nstatement of the specific problems which allegedly occurred<br />\nhas been given. So my frist<br />\nquestion is what happened?<br />\nSecondly, we know very<br />\nlittle about how the decision was<br />\nmade. What standard was used<br />\nto decide this matter? Surely,<br />\npeople get drunk every Spring<br />\nFair and live to fondly remember the occasions. What makes<br />\nlast year so different? In addition, why is music the focus of<br />\nthis decision?

Little did I know, John Waters was<br />\nback in town.<br />\nFor the film-goer who has experienced John Waters' previous endeavors,<br />\nPolyester is no surprise. In fact, one<br />\nwonders if he hasn't gone a bit slack in<br />\nthe passing years (his last film, Desperate<br />\nLiving, premiered in 1977), for Polyester<br />\nlacks the extreme gore and violence of<br />\nMultiple Maniacs, Pink Flamingos, and<br />\nFemale Trouble (1970, 1972 and 1974<br />\nrespectively). However, for those who<br />\nhave never even heard of Waters, and who<br />\nmay be drawn to the new film via his<br />\n\"scent-sational\" promotional gimmick<br />\n\"Odorama,\" numerous reactions are<br />\npossible, the most prevalent being disgust.<br />\nPerhaps I should explain.<br />\nJohn Waters is a weird guy. Even<br />\nweird for Baltimore. What some might<br />\ncall a by-product of Charm City, Waters<br />\ndelights in the bizarre, the sleazy, the<br />\ndecayed. As he says in the first line of his<br />\nautobiography, Shock Value, \"To me,<br />\nbad taste is what entertainment is all<br />\nabout.\" This probably accounts for the<br />\nnumbers of people who walk out after<br /><br />\nthe first twenty minutes of the movie,<br />\nand for those who, after the first showing, disgustedly comment to the people<br />\nwaiting on line for the second, \"Don't<br />\nbother. It's really gross.\"<br />\nWaters' characters are obese<br />\nwomen who go shopping with their hair<br />\nup in bright pink curlers; men who wear<br />\nloud checked blazers with striped pants;<br />\nadolescents who unnerve their parents<br />\nwith the latest fads and unusual fetishes<br />\n\u2014 in other words, utterly tacky people.<br />\nPolyester is the gathering of these characters into Waters' archetypal middle-class<br />\nAmerican family, an all-star cast of<br />\nWaters regulars headed by Divine.<br /><br />\nDivine could use some explanation. For an innocent, it could take more<br />\nthan half of the movie to realize that<br />\nDivine \u2014 the matriarch-heroine of this<br />\nfamily in decay \u2014 is not a woman.<br />\nActually, he is a 300-pound man who, as<br />\nWaters puts it, \"is simply an actor who is<br />\nusually cast as a woman.\" Divine's screen<br /><br />\nEdith Massey in leather and lace<br /><br />\nBlitz: Chic Punks On Dromedaries<br />\nBY GEORGE YATCHISIN<br />\nPunk is dead. The word is out<br />\naround England, even though youths are<br />\nrioting just like the Clash said a few years<br />\nago. The new \"in\" fashion is the Blitz.<br />\nThe trendsetters of what's hip have given<br />\nup on the doom and gloom forecast of<br />\npunk, simply because it was too damn<br />\ndepressing. Why wear ripped t-shirts and<br />\nput safety pins through myself if nobody<br />\nreally cares? Violence may be the answer, but I don't enjoy getting beaten to<br />\na bloody pulp. So why not celebrate?<br />\nDress up, pretend everything's alright.<br />\nIt's surely not a better solution, but it is<br />\ninfinitely more fun.<br />\nThe Blitz is having fun. Taking its<br />\nname from the London club where the<br />\nfad began, the Blitz is not only lifestyle<br />\nand fashion, but more importantly,<br />\nmusic. It has defined the elusive \"new<br />\nromantic\" movement. David Bowie is the<br />\nsuperhero of the Blitz as he is the king of<br />\ndressing up. His poses are both famous<br />\nand infamous, but that's what a Blitz kid<br />\nwants to be. Garish, gaudy, wearing<br />\nmake-up. Brocaded, ruffled, silk slicked.<br />\nLife is a ball.<br />\nBut back to the important thing \u2014<br />\nthe music. The Blitz's roots lie deep in<br />\nEurodisco (what else?), for if you can't<br />\ndance to it it really doesn't matter. In a<br />\ntypical Blitz club one would hear, lots of<br />\nBowie, old Roxy Music, practically<br />\nanything associated with the Glitter<br />\nMovement.<br />\nThere are new groups too, not to<br />\nmention a few who converted to the<br />\nBlitz's bouncy beat. Perhaps the musical<br />\nleader of this new New Wave is Steve<br />\nStrange, a founder of the early Blitz clubs<br />\nand of Visage, one of the original Blitz<br />\ngroups. To typify the essence of the<br />\nmovement, Strange arrived at his first<br />\nU.S. press conference riding a camel.<br />\nLike I said, these people mean to have<br />\nfun.<br />\nClearly, there is an air of irresponsibility that underlies this fad. At times<br />\nthis notion sneaks into the music \u2014 it<br />\nmight sound good, you might want to<br /><br />\nmove your finely tailored outfit to it on<br />\nthe dance floor, but it gets awfully insipid<br />\non the home stereo. The Blitz lads don't<br />\ncare \u2014 this is social music \u2014 but then<br />\nagain, the only group to put out two<br />\n\"official\" Blitz albums so far, Ultravox,<br />\ngot a little more dark and serious the<br />\nsecond time out. Maybe the immature<br />\nwill grow up.<br />\nA sampling of Blitz albums:<br />\nAdam and the Ants. Kings of the<br />\nWild Frontier. What can one say about<br />\nAdam Ant? He's already a cult figure of<br />\nsorts for mixing American Indian and<br />\npirate influences to create music powered<br />\nby two drummers(this is the only similarity to the Doobies). All of the songs<br />\nhere don't really fit the Blitz, but one<br />\nwouldn't want them to. It's a horribly<br />\nproduced album and beyond \"Dog Eat<br />\nDog\" and \"Los Rancheros\" there isn't<br /><br />\nmuch to listen to. (I know \u2014 Antmusic\"<br />\nis an anthem, but that fails to make it<br />\ngood.) However, the group does the<br />\nfashion of the Blitz to the hilt, and gets<br />\npoints for publicizing the fad in the first<br />\nplace.<br />\nClassix Nouveaux. Classix Nouveaux. This is actually an impressive, if<br />\nvery weird, debut. Sal Solo, group leader,<br />\nlooks like a bald Dr. Spock with a vampire fixation, but he has created an album<br />\nwhere six out of eleven tracks are really<br />\ngood (and not just within the Blitz<br />\nmovement). Beware of soprano vocals<br />\nfrom this all-male quartet, not to mention<br />\nlots of synthesizer. Outstanding tracks<br />\nare \"Guilty,\" \"Every Home,\" \"Tokyo,\"<br />\nand an instrumental, \"623,\" that sounds<br />\neven better at 45 r.p.m.<br />\nJourneys to<br />\nSpandau Ballet.<br />\ncont. on p. 13<br /><br />\nlife is depicted partly through Odorama, a<br />\nscratch-and-sniff card that the wary<br />\nviewer cannot escape once he understands<br />\nWaters' use of the device \u2014 that is, to<br />\nhorrify the nose as much as the eyes.<br />\nYou might as well scratch anyway: even<br />\nif you don't, there are bound to be other<br />\nfools in the audience who won't learn<br />\nfrom their mistake (trust in Waters), and<br />\nthereby offend your nose as well as their<br />\nown.<br />\nDivine is rescued from a life<br />\nriddled with alcoholism and impending<br />\ndivorce by none other than Tab Hunter.<br />\nAs the Man In The White Car (a Corvette), Hunter has some marvelously<br />\nsteamy sex scenes with Divine, whom he<br />\nseduces with his still-fifties-ish good<br />\nlooks. What, the astute viewer may<br />\nwonder, does he see in this slob? Waters<br />\nobviously has something up his sleeve, as<br />\nthe film escalates from simpering romanticism to fine-tuned suspense.<br />\nNot to be missed is Edith Massey,<br />\n\"discovered\" by Waters in Baltimore's<br />\nown Fells Point. In a _switch from one of<br />\nher roles as the \"fag-hag\" in Female<br />\nTrouble where her, well, most interesting<br />\ncostume is a skintight S &amp; M black leather<br />\nlace-up, Edie plays Cuddles, Divine's<br />\nrich girlfriend, who favors Lacoste shirts,<br />\nshort white tennis outfits, pink-and-green<br />\nprep-wear, and her chauffeur. Edie, it<br />\nshould be noted, probably weighs almost<br />\nas much as the taller Divine.<br />\nHave I scared you off'? I hope not.<br />\nAlthough the film is not for the truly<br />\nsqueamish, the Hopkins crowd could do<br />\nwith a little Waters excitement. Immersed in academics, we are often saturated with too much good taste. It lakes a<br />\nfilm like Polyester to bring us back to the<br />\nreal world.<br />\nTake this as a dare. Go see<br />\nPolyester at the Charles, 1711 North<br />\nCharles Street, Friday and Saturday at 8<br />\nand 12 p.m. If you survive, stay to see<br />\nPink Flamingos, in which the question,<br />\n\"Who deserves the title of Filthiest<br />\nPerson in the World?\" is answered \u2014<br />\nquite definitively \u2014 daily at 10 p.m., with<br />\na Saturday matinee at six. Be warned,<br />\nthough: some of you may find yourselves<br />\nslightly out of your element.<br /><br />\nRepulsion<br /><br />\nCracked Woman Staring At Cracks<br />\nBY WALTER HOOK<br />\nThis Sunday, Repulsion, directed<br />\nby Roman Polanski, will be playing in the<br />\nReel World. The film will be a treat for all<br />\nof you who enjoy feeling alienated.<br />\nRepulsion opens with lengthy<br />\nscenes of Catherine Deneuve, a beautiful<br />\nblonde woman, walking home from the<br />\nbeauty parlor where she works. She looks<br />\nnervous and uncomfortable when construction workers whistle and jeer at her.<br />\nThen Polanski lets us see her take most of<br />\nher clothes off, wash her legs, and lie on<br />\nher bed \u2014 scenes which Polanski no<br />\ndoubt enjoyed shooting. An unknown<br />\nman has fallen in love with her, and after<br />\nmanaging to land a date, tries to kiss her.<br />\nThe look on our heroine's face tells the<br />\nstory: repulsion.<br />\nMale viewers, like the unknown<br />\nsuitor, have been seduced by Deneuve's,<br />\nlooks. But at least some of us have doubts<br />\nabout the woman's mental capacity. We<br />\noften find her staring in revulsion at<br /><br />\nY-shaped cracks. When her sister leaves<br />\non vacation with her boyfriend, our<br />\nheroine begins to cook a rabbit, and after<br />\nsetting it on the coffee table, she forgets<br />\nall about it. The rotting carcass ornaments her living room for the rest of the<br />\nfilm.<br />\nThe more our heroine puts off her<br />\nsuitor, the more he's convinced of his<br />\nundying love for her. As in E.T.A. Hoffman's \"The Sandman,\" we begin to<br />\nwonder if the woman isn't an automaton.<br />\nThe only personality this woman seems<br />\nto have is her revulsion for men, and the<br />\npressure the predatory suitor puts on this<br />\nautomaton seems to be making it malfunction. She stops going to work, chops<br />\nup her phone cord, and boards up her<br />\nfront door. Meanwhile, the rabbit is still<br />\nrotting. As the decaying dinner seems to<br />\nrepresent her own mental decay, the walls<br />\nof her apartment, which begin surrealistically cracking, not only symbolize her<br />\ncrack, but her cracking up. Then imaginary suitors being raping her, and as her<br /><br />\nrepulsion for men grows, so does her<br />\nmadness.<br />\nThe film is simultaneously witty<br />\nand chilling, making the male viewer<br />\nwince at his own ability to be seduced by<br />\nsuch an automaton. (There is a theory<br />\nthat since most beautiful women are<br />\nrepulsed by aggressive suitors such as<br />\nRoman Polanski, he portrays this repulsion as a form of mental illness to soothe<br />\nhis bruised ego. This is simply untenable.) The emphasis on close-ups creates a<br />\nvery claustrophobic atmosphere, and the<br />\nnumerous scenes shot in all-white rooms<br />\ngive the film a dehumanized quality.<br />\nThough the acting is solid, particularly<br />\nDeneuve's thoroughly convincing portrayal of the dumb blonde, the pacing of<br />\nthe film is painfully slow. Despite the<br />\ncleverness of the film's concepts, too<br />\noften I found myself bored. The film is<br />\nvery rewarding intellectually, but its<br />\nclaustrophobic, dehumanizing atmosphere and slow pacing make it uncomfortable to sit through.<br /><br />\nnortun<br /><br />\nTilt<br />\nma<br />\nYou have been down to<br />\nPeabody for your weekly piccolo<br />\nlesson, and wearily you trudge back<br />\nto Homewood.

Mozart; and Schubert's Trio in B<br />\nFlat major, No. 1, Op. 99. In addition,<br />\nthe Trio performed the Adagio from the<br />\nTrio in B Flat major, Op. 11 by Beethoven, as a memorial to Mary Bradley<br />\nMeyer, a longtime patron of the arts at<br />\nJohns Hopkins who died earlier this<br />\nmonth.<br />\nFor its encore, Beaux Arts<br />\nplayed a movement from the Dumky Trio<br />\nby Antonin Dvorak.<br />\nAlthough the musical proficiency<br />\nof the Beaux Arts Trio, who have performed together for a quarter of a century, is beyond question, the program<br /><br />\nwas disturbing. The excessively romantic<br />\nChausson, which opened the program,<br />\noverpowered the rest of the concert with<br />\nits bathos. The Mozart Trio right afterwards, in particular, was overwhelmed<br />\nby the Chausson, the contrast between<br />\nthe two being emphasized by the finesse<br />\nwith which the Trio played the Mozart as<br />\n'opposed to the overenthusiasm exhibited<br />\nduring the Chausson.<br />\nAlthough the Chausson piece was<br />\ninappropriate, this highly chromatic<br /><br />\nwork, written while Chausson was heavily<br />\ninfluenced by his teacher, Cesar Franck,<br />\nwas played. with the requisite bravado.<br />\nPianist Menahem Pressler was particularly<br />\nimpressive, especially the manner with<br />\nwhich he treated the Bambi-like Anime.<br />\nUnlike the Chausson, the Mozart<br />\nTrio was played too delicately. This<br />\ncomparatively late work, written in 1788,<br />\nthe year of the great \"Jupiter Symphony,\" is characterized by an emphasis<br />\non counterpoint often missing in Mozart's<br /><br />\nMore Junk For Well-DressedPunks<br />\ncont,from p. 9<br />\nGlory. This is the Blitz group in England.<br />\nThey are the kings of the wild Blitz<br />\nfashion. They stink as a musical group.<br />\nWhile O.M.D. occasionally drags, Journeys to Glory is a journey to the Land of<br />\nNod. Spandau Ballet is the group that<br />\ngives the Blitz a bad name among critics;<br /><br />\nat least they look good creating awful<br />\nmusic. In large doses this group produces<br />\nterminal ennui. Stay away at all costs.<br />\nUltravox. Vienna and Rage in<br />\nEden.

ELDRITCH<br />\n(Not Dan Vitale)<br />\nWell, I come into this smoky,<br />\nlow-ceilinged room looks sorta like an<br />\nEgyptian tomb \u2014 Jester's Place, I think<br />\nthey call it \u2014 and I plunk myself down<br />\ninto a seat and settle back to watch the<br />\nshow. First there's this homosexual gotta<br />\nglazed white expression on his face, he<br />\ncomes out and tells everybody to hurry<br />\n'up and sit down so's the show can start. I<br />\ndon't know, he looked kinda like Walter<br />\nHook, but he was talkin' like he had<br />\nmarbles in his mouth. Then it goes all<br />\ndark and we can hear this deep tropical<br />\nvoice singing about limes and cocoanuts,<br /><br />\nBeaux Arts'<br />\nmore youthful works.<br />\ninterpretation, however,seemed to reflect<br />\nthe manner of a younger, more aristocratic Mozart. But even the overrefinement did not masque the brilliance of the<br />\npiece.<br />\nThe Beaux Arts Trio lived up to<br />\nits reputation in the Schubert Trio,<br />\nhowever. The simple elegance of the<br />\nSchubert composition was perfectly conveyed, with class and character.<br /><br />\nand then the lights come on and we see<br />\nthese two guys, one's gotta guitar and the<br />\nother's sittin' behind a pianer. The<br />\nposters said these guys was called the<br />\nPage Boys, I think \u2014 yeah, Ed and Art<br />\nPage. They sang lotsa different songs<br />\nwhich I never found out the names of,<br />\nsome of 'em written by Gordon Footlights and others by Jethro Tool, and<br />\nsome by this guy name of O'Riginal.<br />\nThese last ones were all weird and crazylike, all about Greek cactuses and granola<br />\nsouffle and such like. I thought the<br />\nsongs by O'Riginal were really bizarre<br />\nand strange \u2014 especially this one which<br />\nsounded sorta like a ancient Mid-<br /><br />\nevil drinking song which they sang<br />\ntowards the end, where two more guys<br />\njumped up on stage with the Pages and<br />\nstarted shouting about severing skulls or<br />\nsomethin', so loud and fast till I didn't<br />\nknow what they was singin' about. After<br />\nthis, the two guys left and the Page Boys<br />\nsang a dumb song about eatin' they<br />\nbreakfasts (also by O'Riginal) and then<br />\nthe show was over. Well I'll tell you,<br />\nmy head was a'spinnin' by now, what<br />\nwith all this weird bazooka-music and<br />\neverything, so I just got up, had myself<br />\na few more beers, and high-tailed it outta<br />\nthere. I never did see no jester, neither.<br /><br />\nsynthesizer/violin/viola<br />\nplayer<br />\nBilly<br />\nCurrie are the heart of what's now a<br />\nquartet, and combine their rock sensibilities with that of that Blitz to set Ultravox<br />\napart. Vienna is the best Blitz album,<br />\ncontaining the hit \"Sleepwalk\" and the<br />\ngreatest celebratory instrumental since<br />\nthe \"Overture of 1812\" in \"Astradyne.\"<br />\nRage in Eden is akin to Joy Division<br />\nmeets the Blitz and still is somehow<br />\ncompetent. Rage gets better with repeated listenings and contains one knockout<br />\npunch, \"I Remember (Death in the<br />\nAfternoon).\" Needless to say, the Joy<br />\nDivision side wins out in lyrics and song<br />\ntitles.<br />\nVisage. Visage. Don't get confused, but one of the songs is named<br />\n\"Visage\" and another \"Visa-age.\" Here<br />\nredundancy is the problem, although as<br />\ndance music, this is the Saturday Night<br />\nFever of the Blitz. Buy this one to dance<br />\nto, or to say group leader Steve Strange is<br />\nyour friend, or to listen to the superlative<br />\ncut \"Mind of a Toy\" repeatedly. Midge<br />\nUre and Billy Currie guest star, which is<br />\nprobably what makes this C+ effort<br />\nworth buying.<br /><br />\n-Nr.usiTop\u2022---W,M11..\"\"<br /><br />\nevv<br /><br />\nThe johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Band<br /><br />\n4vo<br /><br />\n+0<br /><br />\npresents its annual<br /><br />\nON%<br /><br />\n9\u2022<br /><br />\nAppearing<br />\nThursday Nights<br /><br />\nJ.<br /><br />\nPaul Trattner<br /><br />\n04 :4<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nThe Magician<br /><br />\nSYMPHONY No. 3<br /><br />\nWAGNER'S<br />\nRIENZI<br /><br />\nNovember 5, November 12<br />\n&amp; November 19<br />\n9:00<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n,4k \u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\nThe Wizardry of the Magician will amaze, astound, and<br />\namuse you.

What followed was an unprecedented<br />\nscreening process whereby Chief<br />\nOfficials of the Administration<br />\nattempted to decipher the Rock<br />\ncontent of proposed bands.<br />\nAlthough this process was rather<br />\nmysterious, it may have been<br />\nunsuccessful. Perhaps, the undergraduates who no doubt have<br />\nstereos, who listen to Rock<br />\nMusic on a regular basis, and<br />\nwho have appreciated its \"effect\" will have better success.<br />\nFourth, it is clear both from<br />\nthe 10/23/8 1 News-Letter article<br />\nand the Ad Hoc Committee's<br />\nletter to the Editor, that the<br />\nStudent Council has based its<br />\ndecision merely on the Committee's recommendations. The<br />\nCommittee's letter refers to a<br />\nReport which is forthcoming.<br />\nWhy has the Student Council<br />\nalready made its decision with-<br /><br />\nout first considering the Report'?<br />\nHow can the Council possibly<br />\nevaluate the basis for the Committee's recommendations without at least reviewing the facts<br />\nand reasons presented in the<br />\nReport? Why?<br />\nNot only am I puzzled by<br />\nthis decision, but I am, frankly,<br />\ndisturbed by it. As a freshman<br />\nwho witnessed the first Spring<br />\nFair in 1972, I am keenly aware<br />\nof the valuable role music has<br />\nplayed at the Fair. Fair originators empnasized music as a very<br />\nappropriate way to both celebrate the unique character of<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nand to allow the entire community to share in that celebration.<br />\nThe Fair's musical showcases<br />\nwith its 2 stages has always been<br />\na primary topic of conversation<br />\namong Fair goers, a major selling<br />\npoint to those getting acquainted with the Fair, and a favorite<br />\nStudents,<br />\nactivity.<br />\nFair<br /><br />\nalumni(ae) and others have enjoyed the opportunities to see<br />\nand hear their friends and<br />\nfamily perform. Musicians have<br />\nplayed for relatively small compensation to be a part of the<br />\ncelebration. The outdoor music<br />\nhas successfully embodied much<br />\nof the idealistic spirit of the<br />\nFair. Yet the Student Council<br />\nnow plans for the first time in<br />\nthe Fair's history to drastically<br />\nreduce the amount of music for<br />\nsome vague, unexplained reason.<br />\nIn addition, the openness of<br />\nthe decisionmaking process is<br />\nquestionable.<br />\nThe Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee's letter indicates that<br />\nthe Chief of Campus Security,<br />\nthe Administration, some members of last year's Spring Fair<br />\nBoard, and some student groups<br />\nwere given input into the decisionmaking process. Why were<br />\nnot members of the student<br />\nbody, graduate students, alumni(ae) and members of the<br /><br />\ncommunity given notice of this<br />\ninquiry and encouraged to participate? If the purpose of the<br />\ncommittee was to include proposing sweeping changes in the<br />\nrunning of the Fair, how could it<br />\nproperly perform this task without first considering the impact<br />\nof its recommendations upon all<br />\nFair participants'?<br />\nMy gut feeling about this<br />\nwhole matter, which is shared by<br />\nothers, is that the Administration, after having made extraordinary efforts to ensure the<br />\nsmooth running of the Fair each<br />\nyear, is suffering from battle<br />\nfatigue. As a result of its weariness with the whole enterprise,<br />\nthe Administration is now sending signals to the students to<br />\neliminate any possible source<br />\nof trouble which starts with T<br />\nwhich does not rhyme with M,<br />\nbut which means Music. It<br />\nappears that there are relatively<br />\nfew undergraduates around this<br /><br />\nplace anymore who are willing<br />\nand able to actively maintain the<br />\nvalue and tradition of the Fair<br />\nby showing that primary Fair<br />\nactivities, in general, and music,<br />\nin particular, are worth the<br />\ntrouble. I hope there is somebody around who will prove this<br />\njudgement incorrect. Otherwise,<br />\nthis Student Council decision<br />\ncould be, in the words of the<br />\nRock Musician Jackson Browne,<br />\nthe Fair's Opening Farewell.<br />\nDavid R.

The last is just<br />\na game, of course, sponsored by<br />\nHopSFA every year. It is called<br />\nthe Killer Game, and the president, John Harkness, a former<br />\nplayer, and Laury Hott, a<br />\nstudent at Hopkins, are running<br />\nthe unusual game this year. The<br />\ngame began this week, with<br />\nabout 35 people participating.<br />\nStudents from all classes<br />\nmay take part in the contest,<br />\nwhich consists of chosen \"killers\" shooting their assigned<br />\n\"victims\" with rubber-tipped<br />\ndart guns. The killer is assigned<br />\none victim at first, and if he kills<br />\nhis victim within two weeks, he<br />\nis immediately given another.<br />\nThis goes on until all of the<br />\nkillers, of which there can be<br />\nany number, kill their victims \u2014<br />\nand each other \u2014 and there is<br />\nonly one person left ... the<br />\nwinner. This winner's prize is<br />\nthe satisfaction of knowing he<br />\nkilled everyone.<br />\nThe other<br />\nplayers gain some satisfaction,<br />\ntoo, of having fun and temporarily turning their minds away<br />\nfrom schoolwork.<br />\nAccording to Hott, the<br />\ngame from last year is still going<br />\non, though it was only supposed<br />\nto last for two weeks. Her<br />\nreason for this is that it went<br />\nfast at first, and then \"it got<br />\nsneaky.\" This was true for all<br />\nthree of the previous games(two<br />\nofficial games and one unofficial<br />\none).<br />\nSome of the victims<br />\nbecame<br />\nespecially<br />\ncautious<br />\naboia killers \u2014 they made sure<br />\nthey had many friends with<br />\nthem at all times, among other<br />\nthings.<br /><br />\nCould this mean that the<br />\ngame is taken too seriously by<br />\nthe players? A few think so.<br />\nHott had a visiting roommate<br />\nlast year who thought that the<br />\ngame was being carried too far<br />\nby extremely enthusiastic participants. But evidently, almost<br />\neveryone else feels differently,<br />\nfor the whole senior class played<br />\nlast year. A former student of<br />\nHopkins said it is a great game<br />\nwhich \"keeps people out of<br />\ntrouble.\" He has played in all<br />\nthe previous contests.<br />\nLike other games. Killer has<br />\nits rules. First of all, there can<br />\nonly be one witness when<br />\nyou kill someone or are killed,<br />\nso you can't jump up in the<br />\nmiddle of class and aim your<br />\ndart gun at your victim. Aiming<br />\nbrings about another rule: no<br />\nhead shots. If you are caught<br />\nshooting someone in the head<br />\narea two times, you are out of<br />\nthe game. No other weapon can<br />\nbe used but a dart gun or rifle<br />\nwith rubber-tipped darts, The<br />\nvictim is not to be informed of<br />\nhis killer: he will know in time,<br />\nbecause before he can shoot, the<br /><br />\nmurderer must say, \"I am<br />\nyour killer.- But there are two<br />\nchances for the victim to escape<br />\ndeath.<br />\nAfter the murderer<br />\nhas announced his identity, the<br />\nvictim has the opportunity to<br />\nshoot his killer if his killer<br />\nis too slow to fire the dart gun.<br />\nAlso, the killer and victim<br />\nmay sign a truce, agreeing not to<br />\nmurder each other.
