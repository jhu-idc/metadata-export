To begin with I'm<br />\na romantic, an idealist.\"<br />\nAt the some time Oles expresses<br />\ndispleasure over several currents of<br />\nstudent behavior. \"I dop't like people<br />\nwho put down other people or things.<br />\nIt's the mark of a small mind. Radicals<br />\nuse putting-down as a weapon. They try<br />\nto get a reaction from things which<br />\nother people hold dear. It's childish and<br />\nalso supremely arrogant.\"<br />\nDick Oles feels that there are two<br />\nreasons why a \"radical minority\" has<br />\npower on campus. \"The radicals are<br />\nhitting and waiting. They alone are the<br />\nkeepers of the revealed truth. They're<br />\nhollering the most and like the old<br />\nsaying, the wheel which squeaks the<br />\nloudest gets the oil.\"<br />\n<br />\nBut he adds, \"Americans are very<br />\ngood natured. They take a heck of a lot,<br />\nbut when they get fed up,look out.\"<br />\nDick Oles, however, would rather talk<br />\nabout fencing than politics. He's of<br />\nmedium height, and robust, muscular<br />\nbuild. Blue eyes twinkle from a small<br />\nhead with brown curly hair.<br />\nWhy?<br />\n\"Aren't you even going to ask me<br />\nwhy I'm coaching? \" he grins. \"Well<br />\nobviously not for the money. I'm just<br />\none of those people who maybe have to<br />\nimpart something of themselves in order<br />\nto feel worthwhile. It certainly isn't for<br />\nthe glory. Maybe I'm like a father who<br />\nhopes his son will be able to pass on the<br />\ngood which he, the father, has taught<br />\nthe son.\"<br />\nSwashbuckling romance has always<br />\nfascinated him. \"But if that's all fencing<br />\nwere,\" he adds, \"I wouldn't be<br />\ninterested. It's more than just a physical<br />\nthing. Fencing is like a fast combination<br />\nof chess on wheels and boxing with<br />\nbrains.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe fencing strip is 3 feet by 40 feet.<br />\nA contest generally takes three minutes,<br />\nand as Oles describes, \"The sport deals<br />\nin fractions of an inch. It requires a<br />\ntremendous amount of precision and<br />\nself-disipline. Many of today's youth<br />\ndon't have the desire, inclination or guts<br />\nfor this. Our \"mortality\" rate is about<br />\n50%.\"<br />\nSince becoming head coach of the<br />\nfencing team in 1960, his teams have<br />\nwon at least one of three conference<br />\nteam championships every year.<br />\n\"I wouldn't be here if I didn't like<br />\nit,\" he says. \"I had offers from<br />\nMaryland and Navy, but I'd rather be<br />\nhere because building something like<br />\nthis is a challenge. The bigger schools<br />\nget kids with experience. We're lucky to<br />\nget one a year.\"<br />\nHe points to some photos on the wall<br />\nof youngsters he has coached. \"These<br />\nwere taken between the formal shots.<br />\nTheir expressions are relaxed, more<br />\ncheerful and revealing. If you still don't<br />\n\u2022 know why I'm coaching, I don't know<br />\nwhat else could help.\"<br />\n<br />\nHealth Center Opens Soon<br />\nThe new East Baltimore<br />\nMedical Plan slated to start on<br />\nOct. 15 will provide the 5,000<br />\nresidents of four area housing<br />\nprojects with almost all of their<br />\naverage health care needs,<br />\naccording to its director, Dr.<br />\nJames Shepardwitli.<br />\nAmong the services to be<br />\noffered are check-ups, maternity<br />\ncare, family planning advice and<br />\ntreatment of drug and alcoholic<br />\nproblems.

M. Kopper, who has<br />\nbeen directing the renovation<br />\nsince July, noted that<br />\nefficient<br />\nfunctioning of the labs has been<br />\nhampered by leaky pipes, faulty<br />\nbench exhaust coverings and<br />\npoor lighting. In the past, it<br />\nwas<br />\nnot uncommon to<br />\nexperience<br />\nclose to 50 fires a year<br />\nbecause<br />\nof the old<br />\ncoverings, he said.<br />\nBecause \u2022 of the limited<br />\nfunding, those labs with the<br />\nmost outdated facilities will be<br />\nattended to first.

There are children of<br />\ndifferent races and financial<br />\nbackgrounds. There are many<br />\nday care centers in Baltimore,<br />\nbut most of them are either<br />\nprivate or for the<br />\nunderprivileged. Homewood has<br />\nboth privileged and<br />\nunderprivileged children. Any<br />\nchildren in the area are eligible<br />\nto use the Center.<br />\nThe weekly rate is $28 but<br />\nscholarships are given in the<br />\nform of reduced rates for those<br />\nwho cannot afford it. The Social<br />\nService Department of Baltimore<br />\nis presently helping eight of the<br />\neighteen children at the Day<br />\nCare Center.<br />\n<br />\nvery little about it, but are<br />\nanxious to learn.\"<br />\nNature Lovers<br />\nWhile there are many<br />\nldifferent and important<br />\nactivities at the center, a main<br />\none concerns nature. The<br />\nchildren are taken on trips to the<br />\nfood market to learn how food<br />\ngrows, and how it is processed<br />\nbefore they eat it. \"We had<br />\nhopes of getting a garden and<br />\nletting the children plant seeds<br />\nand watch them grow, but we<br />\nwere unable to secure the<br />\nnecessary land,\" explained<br />\nBalch.<br />\nAlthough facilities are not<br />\nnumerous for outdoor activities,<br />\nthey frequently visit Wyman<br />\nPark and Druid Hill Park, where<br />\nswings and other playground<br />\nequipment is available.<br />\nThe children love animals and<br />\nthe Center houses three gunea<br />\npigs and a rabbit. They also visit<br />\nthe zoo and go to see farm<br />\nanimals on day trips.<br />\nAnother activity of the Center<br />\nis to visit train stations, railroad<br />\nstations and lumberyards. \"We<br />\nwant them to get a look at the<br />\nworld and the people around<br />\nIthem,\" stated Balch, \"and the<br />\nonly way to do this is to expose<br />\nthem to it.\"<br />\nEach day offers a variety of<br />\nopportunities for creativity.<br />\n<br />\nPhysical activity gives the<br />\nchildren a chance to use some of<br />\ntheir seemingly inexhaustible<br />\nsupply of energy. There is also<br />\nmusic time, when Balch plays<br />\nthe piano . and sings and the<br />\nchildren, - \\dance: and play,<br />\ninstruments, expressing<br />\nthemselves in any way they<br />\nwish.

Over the past<br />\ntwenty years, the graduate writing seminars program has<br />\ndeveloped into one of the best such offerings in the country, attracting some of the nation's best writers to the<br />\none-year master's program. The presence of these people<br />\nallows undergraduates to take advantage of the introductory writing courses, as well as sharpening their skills in the<br />\nundergraduate seminars.<br />\nBehind all of this is Dr. Coleman, who founded the<br />\nDepartment and has nurtured it into its current state. His<br />\nreputation as one of the country's leading poets has<br />\nbrought prestige to Hopkins and to the Writing Seminars,<br />\nthough the 65-year-old Coleman is probably better known<br />\non campus for the understanding, kindness and skill ,he<br />\nbrings to the difficult job of teaching people to write poetry. But, in announcing his decision,Dean Benton<br />\nrefused<br />\nto commit himself to the indefinite continuance or<br />\nthe<br />\nWriting Seminars, only saying that he recognized the<br />\nneed<br />\nfor some sort of writing program. Freshman compos<br />\nition<br />\nmight suffice for the Dean. Though it is hoped that<br />\nhe will<br />\nstay as long as possible, Eliot Coleman's retirem<br />\nent will<br />\ncome in the next few years, and the University<br />\nshould<br />\nmake a committment, financial and otherwise,<br />\nto replace<br />\nhim with a man of eminent stature that will allow the<br />\nprogram to continue in its current form.<br />\n<br />\nSC isolation<br />\nThe Student Council at its latest meeting passed a series of procedural motions aimed at limiting participation<br />\nby those who, unfortunately, are not members of the<br />\ncouncil. Slipped in quietly among their vapid discussions<br />\nabout possible concerts and various meaningless committees, the motions drastically reduce the speaking opportunities of non-members, and completely ban participation in<br />\nSC debates. The Student Council has frequently been attacked as powerless and irrelevant, and this latest move<br />\nonly underscores their isolation from students.<br />\nThe Student Council is almost by nature removed from<br />\nthe campus it's supposed to represent. The so-called representatives and other class officers who serve on it invarift<br />\nably get their posts in elections which have a small turnout<br />\nand little or no choice. Most SC members are.considered<br />\nbig winners if they pull in more than 100 votes. Compounded by the problems of student apathy, and lack of<br />\ngenuine power, the Student Council is an organization<br />\nwhich needs to push for as much participation as possible<br />\nby non-members.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis is in reference to the two<br />\nurgent appeals for voter approval<br />\nof the proposed increase in the<br />\nStudent Activities Fee that were<br />\nin the October 1, 1971 issue of<br />\nthe News-Letter. One appeal was<br />\nin the form of an editorial, and<br />\nthe other presented in a column<br />\nby Dick Heddleson, Student<br />\nCouncil Treasurer.<br />\nMr. Heddleson stated that<br />\n\"This increase is the only (his<br />\nemphasis) way the decrease, in<br />\nthe Student Activity Fund can<br />\nbe reduced.\" Well, perhaps as a<br />\nfreshman I'm not yet acclimated<br />\nto the ways of college student<br />\ngovernment, but I can't<br />\nunderstand why in high school<br />\nqiousands of dollars could be<br />\nraised for student activities by<br />\nstudent activities, wh.\"<br />\nThe paradox becomes clear, I<br />\n'think, when the Sha-na-na<br />\nConcert is considered.

Pleas to<br />\nstop the test, however, can be traced less to<br />\nlegitimate complaints than to politics, anti-war<br />\nfever and irrational complaints. Liberal senators<br />\nhave been leading the charge in opposition,<br />\nincluding Mike Gravel (D-Alaska). Fearful of<br />\noffending Soviet Russia and Canada, the State<br />\nDepartment has joined the foes, while the<br />\nPresident's Council on Environmental Quality is<br />\neager to quash the test.<br />\nBut the Defense Department and the Atomic<br />\nEnergy Commission believe the test is absolutely<br />\nvital to the creation of an effective anti-ballistic<br />\nmissile system. Writing to Alaska Gov. William<br />\nEgan on Aug. 5, Defense Secretary Milvin Laird<br />\nexplained the importance of the test to our<br />\nentire military posture. The Amchitka project, he<br />\nstressed, is crucial to the development of the<br />\nSafeguard anti-ballistic missile program. And the<br />\nABM, he emphasized, is needed to shield our<br />\nMinuteman ICMB force from being wiped out in<br />\na nuclear attack.<br />\nNo Risk<br />\nThe U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's report<br />\nof June fully expounded on the potential dangers<br />\nof the project, demonstrating that the test shot<br />\nholds virtually no risks for Alaskans or the<br />\nenvironment, contrary to the doomsayers. The<br />\ntest is code-named \"Cannikin.\"<br />\nIn arriving at its decision to approve the<br />\nHuman Events is a conservative weekly<br />\n<br />\n\"\"\u2022,,z;;;;,;,f),;<br />\n<br />\nHuman Events<br />\n<br />\nCannikin test, the AEC utilized top scientific<br />\ntalent, including radiobiologists, soil experts,<br />\ngeophysicists, geologists, seismologists and the<br />\nlike.

Echoing Laird, the AEC stresses<br />\nthat it \"is a vital part of the U.S. weapons<br />\ndevelopement program.\"<br />\nThe U.S. already has fired off a test shot on<br />\nAmchitka, code-named \"Milrow,\" in October of<br />\n1969. The yield was approximately one megaton.<br />\nIts sole purpose was to obtain data concerning<br />\nthe physical and biological effects of a high-yield<br />\nunderground explosion upon the Amchitka<br />\nenvironment, and to provide an experimental<br />\nbasis for prediction of the approaching test. The<br />\nAEC reported that the new test can be fired<br />\n\"without important detrimental impact.\"<br />\nThe test won't cause a gigantic earthquake or<br />\nharm man.

The city<br />\nwas very compact and since<br />\ntransportation was on horseback<br />\nor on foot, not many people<br />\nventured far. There was a<br />\ndefinite downtown area where<br />\neveryone worked and only the<br />\nwealthy lived in the suburbs, she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nToday the city has become<br />\nmore district-oriented. As Dr.<br />\nStanton compared it to London,<br />\npeople in Baltimore now stay in<br />\ntheir individual sections of town.<br />\nAn individual knows his city by<br />\nthe small area around him and<br />\nmost of his social life takes place<br />\nin this micro-city. Life has<br />\nmoved from a nuclear city to a<br />\nnuclear neighborhood.<br />\nThe speed in modern<br />\ntransportation is responsible for<br />\nthis shift in city life, according<br />\nto Stanton. People no longer<br />\nfind it necessary to go<br />\n\"downtown\" for their needs or<br />\nto live in the city to hold down a<br />\njob. Dr. Stanton asserted that<br />\n<br />\nUsing Baltimore as an<br />\nexample, Stanton, Chairman of<br />\nArt History, began her<br />\nillustrated lecture on cities and<br />\ntheir future. Dr. Stanton's theme<br />\nwas the \"design\" upon which<br />\nBaltimore was originally built<br />\nand whether this theme would<br />\nbe applicable in the future.<br />\nIn first constructing a city,<br />\nasserted Dr. Stanton, city<br />\nplanning researchers found it<br />\nnecessary to adapt the new<br />\nconstruction to that which<br />\nalready existed.

She is a radio<br />\nartist in India and has given<br />\nconcerts in Varanasi, Calcutta,<br />\nBombay and Indore over the<br />\npast few years. These<br />\nperformances plus a recent tour<br />\nin Holland give Miss Sanyal the<br />\ndistinction of being one of the<br />\nmost widely heard female<br />\nsitarists.<br />\nShe comes from an illustrious<br />\nmusical family or gharana which<br />\nbegan with the great court<br />\nmusician of Akbar's \"darbar\"<br />\nTansen generations ago.

But<br />\nRoberto Aguerro's penalty shot<br />\nwas caught by the Delaware<br />\ngoalie and the momentum went<br />\nback to the Hens. With six minutes left in the half, Naunheim<br />\ncame out of the goal to try to<br />\nmake a save, and the inevitable<br />\nbunching up let Bill Danenberg<br />\nsend the ball into an open Hopkins net. The Blue Hens held this<br />\n2 to 0 lead into the half.<br />\nHeads-Up<br />\nAfter the intermission, Hopkins come out looking like they<br />\nwanted to play some soccer. For<br />\nabout 14 minutes they played<br />\nheads-up, textbook ball but just<br />\ncould not get past a tough Delaware defense. Two missed corner kicks sent the momentum to<br />\nDelaware once again where it<br />\nwas to remain the rest of the<br />\n<br />\nSoccer team against Delaware<br />\non as they finished out the perigame.

As one<br />\nteam member remarked,\"This is<br />\nthe first time in a long while that<br />\nHopkins has started off the season with a winning record, and<br />\nI'd like to keep it that way.\"<br />\n<br />\nquarterback, Don Larson, a<br />\n6'2\", 200 lber. Larson has<br />\nthrown well so far this year. And<br />\nwhy not? His favorite target,<br />\nBruce Montgomery, statistically<br />\nranks as the seventh leading pass<br />\ncatcher in the country.<br />\nWhen Larson gets tired of<br />\nplaying catch with Montgomery,<br />\nhe will hand the ball to 6'1\",<br />\n195 lb. running back Harry Adrion (Cox: \"He looks bigger than<br />\nthat to me\"), who last year<br />\nrushed for 1047 yards in nine<br />\ngames. The Jays' inability to<br />\nstop F&M's rushing game last<br />\nweek will probably induce Ursinus to go more with the run<br />\nthan the pass this week, Cox predicted.<br />\nPressure<br />\nWhile Hopkins' defense allowed F&M 24 pts. last week, \"it<br />\n<br />\ndidn't really play that badly,\"<br />\nsays Cox, \"considering the fact<br />\nthat every time F&M had the<br />\nball, they were inside our 50.<br />\nThat's an awful lot of pressure<br />\non our defense.\"<br />\nThis week, the Jays have been<br />\nworking intensively on keeping<br />\nthe pressure off the defense by<br />\nestablishing good field positionl<br />\nKey to this is a good kicking<br />\ngame that has been hurting so<br />\nfar. Occasional breakdowns in<br />\npunt blocking and several bad<br />\nsnaps have put the pressure on<br />\npunter Jack Thomas.<br />\nBetter punting and more passing can be expected from the<br />\nJays this Saturday. Defensively,<br />\nthey'll try to stop the run and<br />\nforce Ursinus to pass.

No formal elegibility<br />\nguidelines are yet in force<br />\nthough Turner is confident that<br />\nthe various schools and coaches<br />\nwill ultimately come to a common unwritten understanding on<br />\nwho can play \"sub-varsity.\"<br />\n\"The purpose of the sub-varsity<br />\nteam, as I see it, is to give tailenders on the team a chance to<br />\nplay and not to give the secondstringer on a team a chance to<br />\nplay a lot,\" Turner added.<br />\nMuch of the course will depend on whether there are<br />\nenough players to put together a<br />\nsub-varsity team. Football coach<br />\nDennis Cox has not yet decided<br />\nif he will field a sub-varsity<br />\nteam. \"I'd like to have one, not<br />\nonly this year but as long as I'm<br />\nhere as coach. It all depends on<br />\n<br />\nthe numbers and desire of our<br />\nplayers,\" explained Cox. Two<br />\ngames are already on tap for the<br />\nteam, its first being October 29.<br />\nBasketball coach Gary Rupert<br />\nand assistant coach Hoe Loveland will doubtless have little<br />\ndifficulty in getting enough<br />\nbodies on the court for varsity<br />\nand sub-varsity teams.

The<br />\nRotunda is different, designed<br />\nfrom the beginning to provide a<br />\nstyle of shopping previously<br />\nunheard of in the area.<br />\nCommunity Landmark<br />\nTo begin with, only a small<br />\nportion of the project is<br />\nspringing up. In fact, the<br />\nprinciple structure has been a<br />\ncommunity landmark since<br />\n1921, serving 49 years as the<br />\nMaryland Casualty building. This<br />\nshopping center boasts a<br />\nGeorgian cupola complete with<br />\nstained-glass window in the<br />\ndome topping a masonry<br />\nrotunda, with columns both in<br />\nthe rotunda and outside on the<br />\nfront of the building.<br />\nIn addition, the Rotunda will<br />\ndiffer from most shopping malls<br />\nby featuring only smaller<br />\n\"specialty\" shops rather than<br />\nthe usual enormous department<br />\nstores.<br />\n\"In a lot of shopping malls,<br />\nyou feel depersonalized,\"<br />\nexplained Richard Manekin, one<br />\nof several Manekins in the<br />\n<br />\nManekin Corporation, a real<br />\nestate company sharing the<br />\nventure with the Marcasco<br />\nCompany. \"The Rotunda is not<br />\nso large size-wise that you feel<br />\nlost, but big enough that you<br />\nwant to turn the corner to see<br />\nwhat is beyond.\"<br />\nManekin pointed out that the<br />\nstyle of shopping to be provided<br />\nhas been determined largely by<br />\nthe limitations imposed by the<br />\nbuilding. The only additions<br />\nhave been in the courts of the<br />\npreviously \"H\"\u2014shaped<br />\nstructure.<br />\nWhen remodeled, the<br />\nfour-story building will feature<br />\ntwo floors of retail shopping<br />\narea below and two floors of<br />\noffices above.

To begin with I'm<br />\na romantic, an idealist.\"<br />\nAt the some time Oles expresses<br />\ndispleasure over several currents of<br />\nstudent behavior. \"I dop't like people<br />\nwho put down other people or things.<br />\nIt's the mark of a small mind. Radicals<br />\nuse putting-down as a weapon. They try<br />\nto get a reaction from things which<br />\nother people hold dear. It's childish and<br />\nalso supremely arrogant.\"<br />\nDick Oles feels that there are two<br />\nreasons why a \"radical minority\" has<br />\npower on campus. \"The radicals are<br />\nhitting and waiting. They alone are the<br />\nkeepers of the revealed truth. They're<br />\nhollering the most and like the old<br />\nsaying, the wheel which squeaks the<br />\nloudest gets the oil.\"<br /><br />\nBut he adds, \"Americans are very<br />\ngood natured. They take a heck of a lot,<br />\nbut when they get fed up,look out.\"<br />\nDick Oles, however, would rather talk<br />\nabout fencing than politics. He's of<br />\nmedium height, and robust, muscular<br />\nbuild. Blue eyes twinkle from a small<br />\nhead with brown curly hair.<br />\nWhy?<br />\n\"Aren't you even going to ask me<br />\nwhy I'm coaching? \" he grins. \"Well<br />\nobviously not for the money. I'm just<br />\none of those people who maybe have to<br />\nimpart something of themselves in order<br />\nto feel worthwhile. It certainly isn't for<br />\nthe glory. Maybe I'm like a father who<br />\nhopes his son will be able to pass on the<br />\ngood which he, the father, has taught<br />\nthe son.\"<br />\nSwashbuckling romance has always<br />\nfascinated him. \"But if that's all fencing<br />\nwere,\" he adds, \"I wouldn't be<br />\ninterested. It's more than just a physical<br />\nthing. Fencing is like a fast combination<br />\nof chess on wheels and boxing with<br />\nbrains.\"<br /><br />\nThe fencing strip is 3 feet by 40 feet.<br />\nA contest generally takes three minutes,<br />\nand as Oles describes, \"The sport deals<br />\nin fractions of an inch. It requires a<br />\ntremendous amount of precision and<br />\nself-disipline. Many of today's youth<br />\ndon't have the desire, inclination or guts<br />\nfor this. Our \"mortality\" rate is about<br />\n50%.\"<br />\nSince becoming head coach of the<br />\nfencing team in 1960, his teams have<br />\nwon at least one of three conference<br />\nteam championships every year.<br />\n\"I wouldn't be here if I didn't like<br />\nit,\" he says. \"I had offers from<br />\nMaryland and Navy, but I'd rather be<br />\nhere because building something like<br />\nthis is a challenge. The bigger schools<br />\nget kids with experience. We're lucky to<br />\nget one a year.\"<br />\nHe points to some photos on the wall<br />\nof youngsters he has coached. \"These<br />\nwere taken between the formal shots.<br />\nTheir expressions are relaxed, more<br />\ncheerful and revealing. If you still don't<br />\n\u2022 know why I'm coaching, I don't know<br />\nwhat else could help.\"<br /><br />\nHealth Center Opens Soon<br />\nThe new East Baltimore<br />\nMedical Plan slated to start on<br />\nOct. 15 will provide the 5,000<br />\nresidents of four area housing<br />\nprojects with almost all of their<br />\naverage health care needs,<br />\naccording to its director, Dr.<br />\nJames Shepardwitli.<br />\nAmong the services to be<br />\noffered are check-ups, maternity<br />\ncare, family planning advice and<br />\ntreatment of drug and alcoholic<br />\nproblems.

There are children of<br />\ndifferent races and financial<br />\nbackgrounds. There are many<br />\nday care centers in Baltimore,<br />\nbut most of them are either<br />\nprivate or for the<br />\nunderprivileged. Homewood has<br />\nboth privileged and<br />\nunderprivileged children. Any<br />\nchildren in the area are eligible<br />\nto use the Center.<br />\nThe weekly rate is $28 but<br />\nscholarships are given in the<br />\nform of reduced rates for those<br />\nwho cannot afford it.

The<br />\nchildren are taken on trips to the<br />\nfood market to learn how food<br />\ngrows, and how it is processed<br />\nbefore they eat it. \"We had<br />\nhopes of getting a garden and<br />\nletting the children plant seeds<br />\nand watch them grow, but we<br />\nwere unable to secure the<br />\nnecessary land,\" explained<br />\nBalch.<br />\nAlthough facilities are not<br />\nnumerous for outdoor activities,<br />\nthey frequently visit Wyman<br />\nPark and Druid Hill Park, where<br />\nswings and other playground<br />\nequipment is available.<br />\nThe children love animals and<br />\nthe Center houses three gunea<br />\npigs and a rabbit. They also visit<br />\nthe zoo and go to see farm<br />\nanimals on day trips.<br />\nAnother activity of the Center<br />\nis to visit train stations, railroad<br />\nstations and lumberyards. \"We<br />\nwant them to get a look at the<br />\nworld and the people around<br />\nIthem,\" stated Balch, \"and the<br />\nonly way to do this is to expose<br />\nthem to it.\"<br />\nEach day offers a variety of<br />\nopportunities for creativity.<br /><br />\nPhysical activity gives the<br />\nchildren a chance to use some of<br />\ntheir seemingly inexhaustible<br />\nsupply of energy.

Over the past<br />\ntwenty years, the graduate writing seminars program has<br />\ndeveloped into one of the best such offerings in the country, attracting some of the nation's best writers to the<br />\none-year master's program. The presence of these people<br />\nallows undergraduates to take advantage of the introductory writing courses, as well as sharpening their skills in the<br />\nundergraduate seminars.<br />\nBehind all of this is Dr. Coleman, who founded the<br />\nDepartment and has nurtured it into its current state. His<br />\nreputation as one of the country's leading poets has<br />\nbrought prestige to Hopkins and to the Writing Seminars,<br />\nthough the 65-year-old Coleman is probably better known<br />\non campus for the understanding, kindness and skill ,he<br />\nbrings to the difficult job of teaching people to write poetry. But, in announcing his decision,Dean Benton<br />\nrefused<br />\nto commit himself to the indefinite continuance or<br />\nthe<br />\nWriting Seminars, only saying that he recognized the<br />\nneed<br />\nfor some sort of writing program. Freshman compos<br />\nition<br />\nmight suffice for the Dean. Though it is hoped that<br />\nhe will<br />\nstay as long as possible, Eliot Coleman's retirem<br />\nent will<br />\ncome in the next few years, and the University<br />\nshould<br />\nmake a committment, financial and otherwise,<br />\nto replace<br />\nhim with a man of eminent stature that will allow the<br />\nprogram to continue in its current form.<br /><br />\nSC isolation<br />\nThe Student Council at its latest meeting passed a series of procedural motions aimed at limiting participation<br />\nby those who, unfortunately, are not members of the<br />\ncouncil. Slipped in quietly among their vapid discussions<br />\nabout possible concerts and various meaningless committees, the motions drastically reduce the speaking opportunities of non-members, and completely ban participation in<br />\nSC debates. The Student Council has frequently been attacked as powerless and irrelevant, and this latest move<br />\nonly underscores their isolation from students.<br />\nThe Student Council is almost by nature removed from<br />\nthe campus it's supposed to represent. The so-called representatives and other class officers who serve on it invarift<br />\nably get their posts in elections which have a small turnout<br />\nand little or no choice. Most SC members are.considered<br />\nbig winners if they pull in more than 100 votes. Compounded by the problems of student apathy, and lack of<br />\ngenuine power, the Student Council is an organization<br />\nwhich needs to push for as much participation as possible<br />\nby non-members.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis is in reference to the two<br />\nurgent appeals for voter approval<br />\nof the proposed increase in the<br />\nStudent Activities Fee that were<br />\nin the October 1, 1971 issue of<br />\nthe News-Letter.

Pleas to<br />\nstop the test, however, can be traced less to<br />\nlegitimate complaints than to politics, anti-war<br />\nfever and irrational complaints. Liberal senators<br />\nhave been leading the charge in opposition,<br />\nincluding Mike Gravel (D-Alaska). Fearful of<br />\noffending Soviet Russia and Canada, the State<br />\nDepartment has joined the foes, while the<br />\nPresident's Council on Environmental Quality is<br />\neager to quash the test.<br />\nBut the Defense Department and the Atomic<br />\nEnergy Commission believe the test is absolutely<br />\nvital to the creation of an effective anti-ballistic<br />\nmissile system. Writing to Alaska Gov. William<br />\nEgan on Aug. 5, Defense Secretary Milvin Laird<br />\nexplained the importance of the test to our<br />\nentire military posture. The Amchitka project, he<br />\nstressed, is crucial to the development of the<br />\nSafeguard anti-ballistic missile program. And the<br />\nABM, he emphasized, is needed to shield our<br />\nMinuteman ICMB force from being wiped out in<br />\na nuclear attack.<br />\nNo Risk<br />\nThe U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's report<br />\nof June fully expounded on the potential dangers<br />\nof the project, demonstrating that the test shot<br />\nholds virtually no risks for Alaskans or the<br />\nenvironment, contrary to the doomsayers.

Echoing Laird, the AEC stresses<br />\nthat it \"is a vital part of the U.S. weapons<br />\ndevelopement program.\"<br />\nThe U.S. already has fired off a test shot on<br />\nAmchitka, code-named \"Milrow,\" in October of<br />\n1969. The yield was approximately one megaton.<br />\nIts sole purpose was to obtain data concerning<br />\nthe physical and biological effects of a high-yield<br />\nunderground explosion upon the Amchitka<br />\nenvironment, and to provide an experimental<br />\nbasis for prediction of the approaching test.

The city<br />\nwas very compact and since<br />\ntransportation was on horseback<br />\nor on foot, not many people<br />\nventured far. There was a<br />\ndefinite downtown area where<br />\neveryone worked and only the<br />\nwealthy lived in the suburbs, she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nToday the city has become<br />\nmore district-oriented. As Dr.<br />\nStanton compared it to London,<br />\npeople in Baltimore now stay in<br />\ntheir individual sections of town.<br />\nAn individual knows his city by<br />\nthe small area around him and<br />\nmost of his social life takes place<br />\nin this micro-city. Life has<br />\nmoved from a nuclear city to a<br />\nnuclear neighborhood.<br />\nThe speed in modern<br />\ntransportation is responsible for<br />\nthis shift in city life, according<br />\nto Stanton. People no longer<br />\nfind it necessary to go<br />\n\"downtown\" for their needs or<br />\nto live in the city to hold down a<br />\njob. Dr. Stanton asserted that<br /><br />\nUsing Baltimore as an<br />\nexample, Stanton, Chairman of<br />\nArt History, began her<br />\nillustrated lecture on cities and<br />\ntheir future. Dr. Stanton's theme<br />\nwas the \"design\" upon which<br />\nBaltimore was originally built<br />\nand whether this theme would<br />\nbe applicable in the future.<br />\nIn first constructing a city,<br />\nasserted Dr. Stanton, city<br />\nplanning researchers found it<br />\nnecessary to adapt the new<br />\nconstruction to that which<br />\nalready existed. Taken into<br />\nconsideration were the<br />\ntransportation problems, area<br />\nof movement, the small<br /><br />\nIndian music coming<br />\nto the Garrett Room<br />\nBy M.E.

She is a radio<br />\nartist in India and has given<br />\nconcerts in Varanasi, Calcutta,<br />\nBombay and Indore over the<br />\npast few years. These<br />\nperformances plus a recent tour<br />\nin Holland give Miss Sanyal the<br />\ndistinction of being one of the<br />\nmost widely heard female<br />\nsitarists.<br />\nShe comes from an illustrious<br />\nmusical family or gharana which<br />\nbegan with the great court<br />\nmusician of Akbar's \"darbar\"<br />\nTansen generations ago.

As one<br />\nteam member remarked,\"This is<br />\nthe first time in a long while that<br />\nHopkins has started off the season with a winning record, and<br />\nI'd like to keep it that way.\"<br /><br />\nquarterback, Don Larson, a<br />\n6'2\", 200 lber. Larson has<br />\nthrown well so far this year. And<br />\nwhy not?

No formal elegibility<br />\nguidelines are yet in force<br />\nthough Turner is confident that<br />\nthe various schools and coaches<br />\nwill ultimately come to a common unwritten understanding on<br />\nwho can play \"sub-varsity.\"<br />\n\"The purpose of the sub-varsity<br />\nteam, as I see it, is to give tailenders on the team a chance to<br />\nplay and not to give the secondstringer on a team a chance to<br />\nplay a lot,\" Turner added.<br />\nMuch of the course will depend on whether there are<br />\nenough players to put together a<br />\nsub-varsity team. Football coach<br />\nDennis Cox has not yet decided<br />\nif he will field a sub-varsity<br />\nteam. \"I'd like to have one, not<br />\nonly this year but as long as I'm<br />\nhere as coach. It all depends on<br /><br />\nthe numbers and desire of our<br />\nplayers,\" explained Cox. Two<br />\ngames are already on tap for the<br />\nteam, its first being October 29.<br />\nBasketball coach Gary Rupert<br />\nand assistant coach Hoe Loveland will doubtless have little<br />\ndifficulty in getting enough<br />\nbodies on the court for varsity<br />\nand sub-varsity teams.

The<br />\nRotunda is different, designed<br />\nfrom the beginning to provide a<br />\nstyle of shopping previously<br />\nunheard of in the area.<br />\nCommunity Landmark<br />\nTo begin with, only a small<br />\nportion of the project is<br />\nspringing up. In fact, the<br />\nprinciple structure has been a<br />\ncommunity landmark since<br />\n1921, serving 49 years as the<br />\nMaryland Casualty building. This<br />\nshopping center boasts a<br />\nGeorgian cupola complete with<br />\nstained-glass window in the<br />\ndome topping a masonry<br />\nrotunda, with columns both in<br />\nthe rotunda and outside on the<br />\nfront of the building.<br />\nIn addition, the Rotunda will<br />\ndiffer from most shopping malls<br />\nby featuring only smaller<br />\n\"specialty\" shops rather than<br />\nthe usual enormous department<br />\nstores.<br />\n\"In a lot of shopping malls,<br />\nyou feel depersonalized,\"<br />\nexplained Richard Manekin, one<br />\nof several Manekins in the<br /><br />\nManekin Corporation, a real<br />\nestate company sharing the<br />\nventure with the Marcasco<br />\nCompany. \"The Rotunda is not<br />\nso large size-wise that you feel<br />\nlost, but big enough that you<br />\nwant to turn the corner to see<br />\nwhat is beyond.\"<br />\nManekin pointed out that the<br />\nstyle of shopping to be provided<br />\nhas been determined largely by<br />\nthe limitations imposed by the<br />\nbuilding. The only additions<br />\nhave been in the courts of the<br />\npreviously \"H\"\u2014shaped<br />\nstructure.<br />\nWhen remodeled, the<br />\nfour-story building will feature<br />\ntwo floors of retail shopping<br />\narea below and two floors of<br />\noffices above.
