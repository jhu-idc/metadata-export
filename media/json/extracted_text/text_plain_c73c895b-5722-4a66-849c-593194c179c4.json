As a<br />\nresult, a residuum of gloom has<br />\nset in over the campus. The reu.4<br />\nson for this is the common feeW<br />\ning that having lost the Navy<br />\ngame, the Jays have forfeited<br />\nall hopes of a national title. We<br />\nhere feel that this is an essentially fallacious assumption.<br />\nNavy still has two games left.<br />\nThey must face Baltimore University and then Army. While<br />\nnobody would predict that the<br />\nBee's will take the Tars, last<br />\nyear's B.U. team forced the Middies into overtime before taking<br />\na 12-10 loss. Army seizing upon<br />\nthis, won a 10-7 decision at Annapolis over a highly favored<br />\nNavy squad, and became national<br />\nco-champions. While it is unlikely that B.U., which suffered<br />\na 17-6 defeat at the hands of<br />\nVirginia recently, will upset<br />\nNavy, Army might well do so.<br />\nArmy Has Chance<br />\nThe reasons for this are twofold. The first is that Army's<br />\nstrong points and Navy's strong<br />\npoints are complementary. The<br />\nCadets have a strong defense, as<br />\nwitnessed in their holding the<br />\nJays to only 9 goals. Navy, on<br />\nthe other hand, has a stronger<br />\noffense. The game could boil<br />\ndown to which of the two is superior.<br />\nThe second reason is that in<br />\nall Army-Navy games, seasonal<br />\nrecords mean relatively little.<br />\nThese two teams are traditional<br />\nrivals, and hate each other with<br />\na venomous passion. Football<br />\nstories are rampant concerning<br />\nunbeaten Navy teams which have<br />\nlost to previously unvictorious<br />\nArmy squads, and vice versa.<br />\nThis could happen again.<br />\nJays vs. Terps<br />\nWe are not concerned with<br />\nthe odds or probabilities of this<br />\ngame, however, quite so much as<br />\nwe are with those concerning<br />\nthe Jays' upcoming game with<br />\nMaryland's Terrapins. The Terps<br />\nhave not had too successful a<br />\nseason. They have lost to Army<br />\nand Virginia, and were squashed<br />\nby Navy. On the basis of seasonal record, they should lose<br />\nthis Saturday; but, heartened by<br />\nour defeat by Navy they will be<br />\nextra-tough to defeat. If the<br />\n<br />\nJays Strive For Comeback<br />\n'After Tough Loss To Navy<br />\n<br />\nJays succeed in winning the<br />\ngame, however, they may prop<br />\nthemselves into a position for a<br />\ntie with Army and Navy, if the<br />\nCadets succeed in taking the<br />\nMiddies.<br />\nThis victory becomes all important. The Jays are healthier<br />\nand stronger than they were<br />\nlast year, and ought to win. If<br />\nthey do, a little bit of luck and<br />\na considerable amount of prayer<br />\nmight be of some service.<br />\nAlways next year<br />\nThe baseball team repeated its<br />\n3-9 log of last year, but not without a good deal of hope for next<br />\nyear's squad. A quick glance at<br />\nthe record shows that the team's<br />\ntwo best hitters, Leon Poffenberger at .353 and Joe Gotwals<br />\nat .341, will be returning, as will<br />\nthe entire first string infield,<br />\noutfield, and catching staff, with<br />\nthe sole exception of second<br />\nbaseman Leo Hollein. The sole<br />\nproblem, and it is a big one,<br />\nis the graduation of the entire<br />\nfirst string pitching staff, led<br />\nby Dave Leonhard, who garnered all of the Jays' three victories<br />\nthis year.<br />\nAlthough Coach Ross Sachs is<br />\nfaced with this problem, it is<br />\nnot a problem which cannot be<br />\nsolved. This season can be written off, more or less, as a learning one, in which most of the<br />\nplayers learned to work with<br />\neach other. When they return<br />\nnext year, they will be a year<br />\nmore experienced and a year<br />\nbetter. The consequence of this<br />\nshould be an improved defense<br />\nand better hitting. Most of the<br />\nteam's best hitters remain, led<br />\nby Poffenberger and Gotwaki,<br />\nand Dick Carroll and Dennis<br />\nDonnelly came along strong as<br />\nhitters in the latter half of this<br />\nseason, and are looked to for<br />\nprobable improvement. If any of<br />\nthe freshman pitchers can combine with Sachs to provide adequate pitching for this renovated<br />\nunit, baseball might take a big<br />\nstride upward at the Homewood<br />\nnext year.<br />\nApologia<br />\nThe end of the year is gen(Continued on Page 10)<br />\n<br />\nBEY, CUT THAT OUT: Cries Billy Flannery as Don MaeLaughlin<br />\n(12) pushes him aside in preparation for a shot.

As a<br />\nresult, a residuum of gloom has<br />\nset in over the campus. The reu.4<br />\nson for this is the common feeW<br />\ning that having lost the Navy<br />\ngame, the Jays have forfeited<br />\nall hopes of a national title. We<br />\nhere feel that this is an essentially fallacious assumption.<br />\nNavy still has two games left.<br />\nThey must face Baltimore University and then Army. While<br />\nnobody would predict that the<br />\nBee's will take the Tars, last<br />\nyear's B.U. team forced the Middies into overtime before taking<br />\na 12-10 loss. Army seizing upon<br />\nthis, won a 10-7 decision at Annapolis over a highly favored<br />\nNavy squad, and became national<br />\nco-champions. While it is unlikely that B.U., which suffered<br />\na 17-6 defeat at the hands of<br />\nVirginia recently, will upset<br />\nNavy, Army might well do so.<br />\nArmy Has Chance<br />\nThe reasons for this are twofold. The first is that Army's<br />\nstrong points and Navy's strong<br />\npoints are complementary. The<br />\nCadets have a strong defense, as<br />\nwitnessed in their holding the<br />\nJays to only 9 goals. Navy, on<br />\nthe other hand, has a stronger<br />\noffense. The game could boil<br />\ndown to which of the two is superior.<br />\nThe second reason is that in<br />\nall Army-Navy games, seasonal<br />\nrecords mean relatively little.<br />\nThese two teams are traditional<br />\nrivals, and hate each other with<br />\na venomous passion. Football<br />\nstories are rampant concerning<br />\nunbeaten Navy teams which have<br />\nlost to previously unvictorious<br />\nArmy squads, and vice versa.<br />\nThis could happen again.<br />\nJays vs. Terps<br />\nWe are not concerned with<br />\nthe odds or probabilities of this<br />\ngame, however, quite so much as<br />\nwe are with those concerning<br />\nthe Jays' upcoming game with<br />\nMaryland's Terrapins. The Terps<br />\nhave not had too successful a<br />\nseason. They have lost to Army<br />\nand Virginia, and were squashed<br />\nby Navy. On the basis of seasonal record, they should lose<br />\nthis Saturday; but, heartened by<br />\nour defeat by Navy they will be<br />\nextra-tough to defeat. If the<br /><br />\nJays Strive For Comeback<br />\n'After Tough Loss To Navy<br /><br />\nJays succeed in winning the<br />\ngame, however, they may prop<br />\nthemselves into a position for a<br />\ntie with Army and Navy, if the<br />\nCadets succeed in taking the<br />\nMiddies.<br />\nThis victory becomes all important. The Jays are healthier<br />\nand stronger than they were<br />\nlast year, and ought to win. If<br />\nthey do, a little bit of luck and<br />\na considerable amount of prayer<br />\nmight be of some service.<br />\nAlways next year<br />\nThe baseball team repeated its<br />\n3-9 log of last year, but not without a good deal of hope for next<br />\nyear's squad. A quick glance at<br />\nthe record shows that the team's<br />\ntwo best hitters, Leon Poffenberger at .353 and Joe Gotwals<br />\nat .341, will be returning, as will<br />\nthe entire first string infield,<br />\noutfield, and catching staff, with<br />\nthe sole exception of second<br />\nbaseman Leo Hollein. The sole<br />\nproblem, and it is a big one,<br />\nis the graduation of the entire<br />\nfirst string pitching staff, led<br />\nby Dave Leonhard, who garnered all of the Jays' three victories<br />\nthis year.<br />\nAlthough Coach Ross Sachs is<br />\nfaced with this problem, it is<br />\nnot a problem which cannot be<br />\nsolved. This season can be written off, more or less, as a learning one, in which most of the<br />\nplayers learned to work with<br />\neach other. When they return<br />\nnext year, they will be a year<br />\nmore experienced and a year<br />\nbetter. The consequence of this<br />\nshould be an improved defense<br />\nand better hitting. Most of the<br />\nteam's best hitters remain, led<br />\nby Poffenberger and Gotwaki,<br />\nand Dick Carroll and Dennis<br />\nDonnelly came along strong as<br />\nhitters in the latter half of this<br />\nseason, and are looked to for<br />\nprobable improvement. If any of<br />\nthe freshman pitchers can combine with Sachs to provide adequate pitching for this renovated<br />\nunit, baseball might take a big<br />\nstride upward at the Homewood<br />\nnext year.<br />\nApologia<br />\nThe end of the year is gen(Continued on Page 10)<br /><br />\nBEY, CUT THAT OUT: Cries Billy Flannery as Don MaeLaughlin<br />\n(12) pushes him aside in preparation for a shot.
