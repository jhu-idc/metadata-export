For those intricate high-speed<br />\nmachines, he must not only act as<br />\ndesigner, but must often assist in<br />\nselling, and must look after the<br />\nservice when problems arise in<br />\noperation.

Have they opportunity to<br />\n,-xercise creative talents? Or are<br />\nthey forced into narrow grooves?<br />\nThis series of advertisements<br />\nthrows light on these questions.

Laffoon designed one. Then, through<br />\nan unexpected change in a trade<br />\nsituation, the machine was not<br />\nused. Did it go to the scrap heap?<br />\nRead and see.<br />\nIndustry had been seeking a<br />\nbetter way to melt expensive metal<br />\nof high heat resistance\u2014aluminum,<br />\nplatinum, certain alloy steels, and<br />\nthe like. Ordinary smelting methods couldn't be used. Properties<br />\n<br />\nhad to be kept unchanged; and the<br />\ngreat heat liquefied the ordinary<br />\ncrucible as well as- the metal. Laffoon's discarded radio- generator<br />\nwas .found to offer an ideal application to a new high- frequency<br />\ninduction furnace for melting those<br />\nspecial metals; and so Laffoon designed that machine.<br />\n. You can measure the advance<br />\nin high-speed -turbo-generator apparatus by comparing the models<br />\nof 1918 (when Laffoon entered the<br />\nparticular field to which he has<br />\ncontributed), with those of 1926.<br />\nThen 25,000 KVA was some machine.
