In<br />\nview of the fact that two class<br />\nmeetings were taking place at<br />\nthe same time, it is reasonable to<br />\nexpect that the normal attendance<br />\nwill be much ;greater than the<br />\nabove figure, far outstripping alt\u2022<br />\nprevious records of the society.<br />\nDean Latane made a brief address, in which he extended his<br />\nbest wishes for the coming year.<br />\nIn the course of his talk, he pointed out, among other things, that<br />\nthe justice of the Jews' claims to<br />\nPalestine has been recognized by<br />\nthe statesmen of the world. Dr.<br />\nLatane was followed by Dr. David S. Blondheim, of the French<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nDr. Blondheim's<br />\ntalk consisted chiefly of 'advice<br />\nconcerning the work of the coming year. He reminded the members that it is their duty as well<br />\nas privilege to investigate the academic phases of the Zionist movement. He urged those present to<br />\nmaintain the reputation that the<br />\nHopkins Society possesses in the<br />\nfield of collegiate Zionist activity<br />\n\u2014a reputation comparable to that<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nin the field of education and science.<br />\nFollowing Dr. Illond.heim's addn.:4s there- was a discussion of<br />\n''plans for the season. It is intended\u2022to establish a number of study<br />\ncircles, details of which will be<br />\nannounced later.

Copies of these regulations have been<br />\nposted in conspicuous places so<br />\nthat no excuse is accepted for not<br />\ncomplying with them. Already<br />\nbands of zealous sophomores have<br />\ntaken care to inform the ignorant<br />\nand punish the flagrant guilty.<br />\nThere are, however, few of the<br />\nlatter type. By far the great majority of the freshmen have received the regulations in the spirit<br />\nin which they are given, regarding<br />\nthem not as methods of hazing or<br />\nbullying upon the part of the<br />\nsophomores, but as traditions and<br />\ncustoms imposed upon- them by<br />\nthe entire University.<br />\nThe freshman regulations for<br />\ntime Class of 1923 are as follows:<br />\n1. Freshmen must know the<br />\nsongs and yells in the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nHandbook before the first class<br />\nmeeting.<br />\n2. In crossing the campus,<br />\nfreshmen must keep to the walks<br />\n3. Freshmen may not wear<br />\ntheir bats in any University<br />\n4.

In entering doors no freshman may precede an upper classman.<br />\n9. Freshmen must not keep<br />\ntheir hands in their pockets while<br />\non University property.<br />\n10. Each 'freshman must obey<br />\nthese regulations until the Easter<br />\nholidays.<br />\nIn order that regulation No. 4<br />\nmay be more strictly enforced, the<br />\nfreshmen have been divided into<br />\nsections, each of which is under<br />\na sophomore leader. These sections<br />\nwill be assembled on the quadrangle, in front of \u2022 Gilman Hall<br />\nshortly before the game and will<br />\nthen be marched in squad formation to Homewood Field.

In<br />\nview of the fact that two class<br />\nmeetings were taking place at<br />\nthe same time, it is reasonable to<br />\nexpect that the normal attendance<br />\nwill be much ;greater than the<br />\nabove figure, far outstripping alt\u2022<br />\nprevious records of the society.<br />\nDean Latane made a brief address, in which he extended his<br />\nbest wishes for the coming year.<br />\nIn the course of his talk, he pointed out, among other things, that<br />\nthe justice of the Jews' claims to<br />\nPalestine has been recognized by<br />\nthe statesmen of the world. Dr.<br />\nLatane was followed by Dr. David S. Blondheim, of the French<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nDr. Blondheim's<br />\ntalk consisted chiefly of 'advice<br />\nconcerning the work of the coming year. He reminded the members that it is their duty as well<br />\nas privilege to investigate the academic phases of the Zionist movement.
