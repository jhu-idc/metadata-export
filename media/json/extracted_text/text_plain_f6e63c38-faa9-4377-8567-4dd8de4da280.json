Going into the<br />\nfront room he.saw his valet, Chez, lying on the dirty sofa;<br />\nhe was spitting on the ceiling and rather successfully<br />\naiming at the same spot. The nonchalance of his servant<br />\nenraged Andy; he hit him on the forehead with his hat,<br />\nsaying: \"You pig, you are always doing something<br />\nstupid.\"<br />\nChez jumped off and helped him off with his coat, but<br />\nmuttering all the while,\"I don't believe ne did that!\"<br />\nAndy then slowly approached the mirror and at first<br />\nscrewed up his eyes with the idea that maybe his nose<br />\nwould appear in its proper place; but at the last minute<br />\nsprang back, saying,\"what a terrible sight!\"<br />\nIt was really incomprehensible. However, thinking over<br />\nthe circumstances, Chairman Andy reached toe<br />\nsupposition that what might be nearest to the truth that<br />\nthe person most responsible for this could be no other<br />\nthan Madame Sbarsky, who wanted him to marry her<br />\ndaughter. He himself liked flirting with'her, but avoided a<br />\nagement. When the mother informed him<br />\nplainly that<br />\n..<br />\n,<br />\nished for marriage, he had slyly put her<br />\noff with complimelits.\u201esaying that he was still young. And<br />\nthat Madame Sbarsky NO therefore made up her mind,<br />\nprobably out of revenge,c.. ruin him, and had hired for<br />\nthe purpose some peasant witches, because it was<br />\nimpossible to suppose that thellose had been cut off in<br />\nany other way; no one had come into his room; .the<br />\nbarber Stretch Hogan had shaved him on Wednesday, and<br />\nAIM rest of the day he was allright - that he remembered<br />\ni<br />\nand was quite certain about; besides, he would have felt<br />\npaig and there could be no doubt that the wound could<br />\nnot heal so soon and be as flat as a pancake. He formed<br />\nvarious plans in his mind: either timmon Madame<br />\nSbarsky in court or go to her himself and confront her,<br />\nwhen his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of Chez<br />\nletting a visitor in the door.<br />\n\"Does the collegiate hero Andy live lier 9 the voice<br />\nrang out.<br />\n\"Come in.

His hands trembled. Cautiously<br />\nand gently he replaced it in its- former position. Oh<br />\nhorror, the nose would not stick on!.... He put it to ais<br />\nlips, slightly warmed it with his breath, and again applied,<br />\nit to the flatspace between his two cheeks; but nothing<br />\nwould make the nose stick.<br />\nHe called Cilez and sent him for Ecort Keuf, the<br />\npresidential premedical student wao makes strange noises.<br />\nHe came immediately and simultaneously with Chez, and<br />\nthen went upstairs to look at the collegiate hero's nose.<br />\nAfter studying it in great detail, the doctor<br />\npronounced, \"No, it's impossible.

Then the rumor<br />\nspread that it was not on Charles Street but in Wyman<br />\nPark that the nose walked, and more crowds went, only<br />\nto be surprised from benind.

When toese young men left their<br />\nJournals, magazines, cafe tables and cinema clubs to make<br />\nfilms of their own, they develoned drastically different<br />\nStyles; yet every one of them acknowledged the effect<br />\nBazin had on his development as a critic and a director.<br />\nAlthougn Bazin died on November 11, 1958, tile day after<br />\nShooting began for The 400 Blows. Truffaut and toe<br />\nOther pupils of Bazin generally remained faithful to their<br />\ncinematic godfather. This film, along with a few other<br />\nFrench movies of the late 1950's, such as Alain Resnais'<br />\nHiroshima Mon Amour and Godard's Breathless,<br />\nestablished what came to be known as tile Nouvelle Vague<br />\n(New Wave).<br />\nOnly 27 wrien lie made The 400 Blows, Trufftrut filmed<br />\nin Paris, with entirely natural settings, both interior and<br />\nexterior. The natural settings, together with the minimum<br />\nof camera tricks, do mucit to give one the impression that<br />\n\u2022 Truffaut has not so much invented a story as filmed one<br />\nalready in existence. But what really convinces one of the<br />\nauthenticity and intensity of the story is the performance<br />\nof Jean-Pierre L,eaud as the thirteen-year-old lead<br />\ncharacter, Antoine Doinel. It seems inappropriate, and<br />\nsomehow even insulting, to call Leaud's presence in the<br />\nfilm\"acting.\" As is tile case with One of Truffaut's<br />\nmentors, Robert Bresson, the actor, rather than<br />\nPerforming in a theatrical manner, should be a model of<br />\nnatural benavior. Audiences believe in the authenticity of<br />\nAntoine Doinel just as strongly as they believe in the<br />\nauthenticity of a Bresson<br />\ncountry priest.<br />\nAntoine has a grim, unhappy life both in school and at<br />\nhome. His teachers are nearly grotesque in their absence<br />\nof sympathy for the problems and needs of adolescents.<br />\nHis parents, constantly quarreling, neglect the boy.

In fact, hiS first<br />\nthe<br />\ndebut was a Baltimore production of Victoria<br />\nliveg;\" in wiiich he played \"the good.:.st man who ever<br />\ne'\u2022 lie was so good he hardly had any humanity at<br />\nall\"<br />\n.'<br />\n<br />\nin the street one day, he sees his mother witir a strange<br />\nman, but ms father, obsessed with automobiles and nis<br />\nGuide Michelin, knows nothing of her adultery. This<br />\nchild, like nearly all tile children in Truffaut's films, is<br />\nmore observant and sensitive than the adults around him.<br />\nWhat Antoine learns of tne world, though, serves only to<br />\nfurther confuse and depress him.<br />\nLike the environment in which tile Mouchette of:<br />\nnovelist George Bernanos lives, the entire environment,<br />\nphysical, and personal, that surrounds Antoine, is bleak.<br />\nThere are, however, some comforts, several brief respites,<br />\nincluding Antoine's good friend Rene. And at an<br />\namusement park, Antoine rides \"The Rotor,\" enjoying<br />\nthis short, exhilerating escape from his dismal milieu.<br />\nSimilarly, when, Bresson filmed Bernanos' Mouchette in<br />\n1966, he added a scene in an amusement park that is not<br />\npresent in the novel. Mouchette, alienated from nearly<br />\neveryone in her provincial village, rides in a bumper car<br />\nand delights in being bumped by other cars, because it is a<br />\nrecognition, though nonverbal and violent, of her<br />\nexistence.<br />\nMouchette, at least, had tile benefit of a loving mother.<br />\nAntoine's mother tends to verbally abuse the boy woen<br />\nshe isn't ignoring nim. \"My nusband is busy with an<br />\nautomobile club,\" she offers by way of excuse. \"It's<br />\npossible we left the ciiild alone sometimes...He hates<br />\nsports-she'd rattler stay shut up for hours at the movies<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Francois Truffaut<br />\nand ruin nis eyes.\" Neglected, Antoine soon turns to<br />\npetty thefts, and it isn't long before he's locked up and<br />\nsent to a c\u2014enter for delinquent minors. \u2022Truffaut's<br />\npresentation of these scenes is without directorial<br />\ncommentary. Totally absent is the sentimentality--and,<br />\nsome would assert, senility--of Truffaut's most recent<br />\nstudy of childhood, Small Change. The film is not<br />\nautobiographical. Jacques Rivette, in a 1959 issue of<br />\nCa hiers c/a Cinema, put it rather well: \"Francois<br />\nTruffaut's strorrg point is that he never directly speaks of<br />\nhimself, but instead patiently dogs the footsteps of<br />\nanother young boy wrio perhaps resembles him like a.<br />\nbrother, but an objectified younger brother.\"<br />\nDuring an encounter Antoine has with a woman<br />\npsychologist near tile end of The 400 Blows, we never see,<br />\nbut only hear, the woman. The only image we see is a<br />\nshot of Antoine. That shot dissolves, but is followed by<br />\nan identical snot. Again, as witii Bresson, dr,tracting,<br />\nextraneous details have been stripped away, leaving<br />\nnothing but tile actor's face. For Truffaut, indeed for the<br />\n,nistory of cinema, it was a revolutionary step. Georges<br />\nFranju, in an interview with Truffaut, explains why this<br />\nsequence is the finest in what many consider Truffaut's<br />\nfinest film: \"This is the first film that ever showed a kid<br />\nhaving a four-minute conversation, with no curs to<br />\nanything else.

Maybe the easiest<br />\nplace to start is with the factual<br />\ninformation: the records.<br />\nTim Collins, in particular, was!<br />\na record breaker in the past week'<br />\nby setting a pool and university<br />\nrecord in the 1000 meter<br />\nfreestyle with a time of 9:54<br />\nSaturday, and then breaking his<br />\nown record Wednesday night by<br />\n16 seconds. His official time was<br />\n9:38.8. There were also<br />\nuniversity records set in the 400<br />\nMedley relay by Jon Klein, Bill<br />\nSmiddy, Doug Morgan, and<br />\nFrancis Florez: the 200 freestyle<br />\nby Francis Florez and the 500<br />\nfree by Tim Collins. And that's<br />\nonly part of it.<br />\nThe performances of the team<br />\nput the Hopkins team as the,<br />\nleading team in Division III in toe<br />\nnation in the following events:<br />\n400 Medley Relay, Tim Collins in<br />\nthe 1000 and 500 free, Florez in<br />\nthe 200 free, Smiddy in the 200<br />\nIndividual Medley, and the team<br />\nis also second and third in the<br />\n200 backstroke with Doug<br />\nMorgan and Jon Klein.<br />\nProbably one of the most<br />\nexcited members of the team,<br />\nthough, would have to be Bill<br />\nSmiddy. To say that this was one<br />\nof the most important meets of<br />\nthe year for him would not be<br />\ngiving it enough emphasis.<br />\nIn the 200 breaststroke, Bill<br />\nSmiddy came in first followed by<br />\nFrosh Jon Blank. It was more<br />\nthan a simple victory, however,<br />\nfor Smiddy. His time qualified<br />\nhim for the Division I Nationals<br />\nthat will be held in Long Beach,,<br />\nCalifornia the last week in March.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Welsh was so sure of<br />\nSmiddy's ability to qualify that<br />\nhe confirmed the hotel<br />\nreservations last week.<br />\nWelsh said: \"He set a<br />\nuniversity record, a pool record<br />\nand further established his lead in<br />\nthe Nation in Division III. By<br />\nqualifying for Division I he will<br />\nbe competing with the best in the:<br />\ncountry.\" The Division I cuts,.<br />\nhe added, are amazingly tough.<br />\nThey are designed to limit the<br />\nnumber of swimmers in the<br />\ncountry to 40 in the 200<br />\nbreaststroke.<br />\nThe pivotal event in the meet<br />\ncould easily be pinned as the 100'<br />\nfreestyle. Welsh saw the victory<br />\nas unexpected. Maryland should<br />\nhave won, but Francis Florez<br />\nmanaged to pull it out for the<br />\nteam and with that event bring<br />\nvictory a little closer to a_reality.<br />\nThe event that preceeded the<br />\n100 freestyle was the 200<br />\nbutterfly which was a toss up,<br />\nbut Maryland came out on top.<br />\nCoach Welsh adds that \"If<br />\nMaryland had then gone 1-2 in<br />\nthe 100 freestyle, the meet<br />\nwould have been over right<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nTim Collins' victory in the<br />\n1000 freestyle was also a major<br />\nvictory.Welsh feels that with his<br />\nperformance no one in the<br />\nEastern United States would have<br />\nbeen able to beat him.<br />\nJon Klein also gave an<br />\nimportant assist in the relay by<br />\ndelivering in the Medley Relay.<br />\nThe backstroke was the key to a<br />\nvictory in this event and it was<br />\nimperative that Hopkins win this<br />\nevent. The Hopkins team finished<br />\nfirst with participation by Klein,<br />\nSmiddy, Morgan, and Florez.<br />\nThe actual results of the meet<br />\nwere so astounding that it is<br />\npossible to list tile particulars<br />\nforever, but it is just as important<br />\nto realize what the meet meant<br />\nto the team. Primarily, it was the<br />\nfirst time ever that Hopkins has<br />\nbeen victorious over the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland team.<br />\nWelsh sees the actual victory as<br />\nastounding and the way in which<br />\nthe team pulled itself together<br />\nfor the meet. \"They really got<br />\n<br />\nLi<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Aquamen<br />\npsyched. My job as coach<br />\nnecessarily begins and ends at the<br />\npool, but these kids see each<br />\nother every day. They got each<br />\nother so up for the meet that 1<br />\ncould see their own excitement<br />\nbuilding.\"<br />\nAs a dual meet it was<br />\ndefinitely, in the eyes of the<br />\ncoach, and anyone who had the<br />\nthrill of watching, the biggest<br />\nmeet of the year. The stands at<br />\nthe Athletic Center were filled<br />\nand the encouragement of the<br />\ncrowd must certainly be cited as<br />\nan encouraging factor in the<br />\nvictory.<br />\nTim Welsh was quick to give<br />\ncredit where it was due and could<br />\nnot help thanking the Assistant<br />\nCoach, Josii Treem who was a<br />\nformer Hopkins swimmer. Welsh<br />\nsaid, \"His support held us<br />\ntogether. His encouragement and<br />\nstability was a definite factor in<br />\nthe victory.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins team worked<br />\nhard fot this victory and they<br />\nmost certainly deserved it. All of<br />\nthe morning workouts and<br />\npractices since October have<br />\nculminated in a superb dual<br />\nmeet. Francis Florez summed up<br />\nthe sentiments of toe entire team<br />\nwhen he said at the end of the<br />\nmeet, \"This is the feeling that \u2022<br />\nmakes swimming worthwhile.\"<br />\n<br />\nVirgin win at Goucher<br />\nBY RON BIALEK<br />\nCrushing vicotries are not the<br />\nusual natur,<br />\n: of. the Blue Jay<br />\nWomen's Basketball team.<br />\nTuesday evening was different.<br />\nCrushing is the only way to<br />\ndescribe Hopkins 48-25 win over<br />\ntheir weaker opponent, Goucher<br />\nCollege.<br />\nHopkins came out early in<br />\ndecisive fashion looking for the<br />\nfast break and applying- a tough<br />\nfull court press.

Going into the<br />\nfront room he.saw his valet, Chez, lying on the dirty sofa;<br />\nhe was spitting on the ceiling and rather successfully<br />\naiming at the same spot. The nonchalance of his servant<br />\nenraged Andy; he hit him on the forehead with his hat,<br />\nsaying: \"You pig, you are always doing something<br />\nstupid.\"<br />\nChez jumped off and helped him off with his coat, but<br />\nmuttering all the while,\"I don't believe ne did that!\"<br />\nAndy then slowly approached the mirror and at first<br />\nscrewed up his eyes with the idea that maybe his nose<br />\nwould appear in its proper place; but at the last minute<br />\nsprang back, saying,\"what a terrible sight!\"<br />\nIt was really incomprehensible. However, thinking over<br />\nthe circumstances, Chairman Andy reached toe<br />\nsupposition that what might be nearest to the truth that<br />\nthe person most responsible for this could be no other<br />\nthan Madame Sbarsky, who wanted him to marry her<br />\ndaughter. He himself liked flirting with'her, but avoided a<br />\nagement.

When toese young men left their<br />\nJournals, magazines, cafe tables and cinema clubs to make<br />\nfilms of their own, they develoned drastically different<br />\nStyles; yet every one of them acknowledged the effect<br />\nBazin had on his development as a critic and a director.<br />\nAlthougn Bazin died on November 11, 1958, tile day after<br />\nShooting began for The 400 Blows. Truffaut and toe<br />\nOther pupils of Bazin generally remained faithful to their<br />\ncinematic godfather. This film, along with a few other<br />\nFrench movies of the late 1950's, such as Alain Resnais'<br />\nHiroshima Mon Amour and Godard's Breathless,<br />\nestablished what came to be known as tile Nouvelle Vague<br />\n(New Wave).<br />\nOnly 27 wrien lie made The 400 Blows, Trufftrut filmed<br />\nin Paris, with entirely natural settings, both interior and<br />\nexterior. The natural settings, together with the minimum<br />\nof camera tricks, do mucit to give one the impression that<br />\n\u2022 Truffaut has not so much invented a story as filmed one<br />\nalready in existence. But what really convinces one of the<br />\nauthenticity and intensity of the story is the performance<br />\nof Jean-Pierre L,eaud as the thirteen-year-old lead<br />\ncharacter, Antoine Doinel. It seems inappropriate, and<br />\nsomehow even insulting, to call Leaud's presence in the<br />\nfilm\"acting.\" As is tile case with One of Truffaut's<br />\nmentors, Robert Bresson, the actor, rather than<br />\nPerforming in a theatrical manner, should be a model of<br />\nnatural benavior. Audiences believe in the authenticity of<br />\nAntoine Doinel just as strongly as they believe in the<br />\nauthenticity of a Bresson<br />\ncountry priest.<br />\nAntoine has a grim, unhappy life both in school and at<br />\nhome. His teachers are nearly grotesque in their absence<br />\nof sympathy for the problems and needs of adolescents.<br />\nHis parents, constantly quarreling, neglect the boy. While<br /><br />\nVincent Price<br />\nreturns to<br />\nBaltimore as<br />\nOscar Wilde<br />\n,<br /><br />\nBY NED A.

Wilde Diversions mid Delights. But<br />\nN's!ii more interesting than<br />\nthe character ne is portraying,<br />\nis hie<br />\nfigure of Price himself.<br />\nMr. Price is a delightful presence wrio seems never to be<br />\ncamera. His ready wit and charm immediately<br />\nc.aPtivated Lie audience<br />\nof reporters at the Morris<br />\n!<br />\n.leciianic Theater. When Vincent Price tells you now<br />\n,<br />\nw.oriderful he was in a particular movie role,<br />\nyou believe<br />\n!<br />\n1 411, because he's absolutely wonderful in real life. He<br />\nis a<br />\nPeaker wno has the uncanny ability to turn even the<br />\nost ridiculous<br />\nquestions into intelligent responses.<br />\nca Q: You seem so nice and such a gentleman riere. How<br />\n.101.1<br />\n11<br />\nplay such terrible people on screen?<br />\n-1): Easily. I believe in villains, not very much in<br />\n\"t,eroes. I love villains.Bes<br />\nides, villains don't really think<br />\nY're<br />\nkiod villains. After all, Charles Manson still believes ne's<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nThis is not Mr.<br />\nPrice's Baltimore debut. In fact, hiS first<br />\nthe<br />\ndebut was a Baltimore production of Victoria<br />\nliveg;\" in wiiich he played \"the good.:.st man who ever<br />\ne'\u2022 lie was so good he hardly had any humanity at<br />\nall\"<br />\n.'<br /><br />\nin the street one day, he sees his mother witir a strange<br />\nman, but ms father, obsessed with automobiles and nis<br />\nGuide Michelin, knows nothing of her adultery. This<br />\nchild, like nearly all tile children in Truffaut's films, is<br />\nmore observant and sensitive than the adults around him.<br />\nWhat Antoine learns of tne world, though, serves only to<br />\nfurther confuse and depress him.<br />\nLike the environment in which tile Mouchette of:<br />\nnovelist George Bernanos lives, the entire environment,<br />\nphysical, and personal, that surrounds Antoine, is bleak.<br />\nThere are, however, some comforts, several brief respites,<br />\nincluding Antoine's good friend Rene. And at an<br />\namusement park, Antoine rides \"The Rotor,\" enjoying<br />\nthis short, exhilerating escape from his dismal milieu.<br />\nSimilarly, when, Bresson filmed Bernanos' Mouchette in<br />\n1966, he added a scene in an amusement park that is not<br />\npresent in the novel. Mouchette, alienated from nearly<br />\neveryone in her provincial village, rides in a bumper car<br />\nand delights in being bumped by other cars, because it is a<br />\nrecognition, though nonverbal and violent, of her<br />\nexistence.<br />\nMouchette, at least, had tile benefit of a loving mother.<br />\nAntoine's mother tends to verbally abuse the boy woen<br />\nshe isn't ignoring nim. \"My nusband is busy with an<br />\nautomobile club,\" she offers by way of excuse. \"It's<br />\npossible we left the ciiild alone sometimes...He hates<br />\nsports-she'd rattler stay shut up for hours at the movies<br /><br />\n\u2022 Francois Truffaut<br />\nand ruin nis eyes.\" Neglected, Antoine soon turns to<br />\npetty thefts, and it isn't long before he's locked up and<br />\nsent to a c\u2014enter for delinquent minors. \u2022Truffaut's<br />\npresentation of these scenes is without directorial<br />\ncommentary. Totally absent is the sentimentality--and,<br />\nsome would assert, senility--of Truffaut's most recent<br />\nstudy of childhood, Small Change. The film is not<br />\nautobiographical. Jacques Rivette, in a 1959 issue of<br />\nCa hiers c/a Cinema, put it rather well: \"Francois<br />\nTruffaut's strorrg point is that he never directly speaks of<br />\nhimself, but instead patiently dogs the footsteps of<br />\nanother young boy wrio perhaps resembles him like a.<br />\nbrother, but an objectified younger brother.\"<br />\nDuring an encounter Antoine has with a woman<br />\npsychologist near tile end of The 400 Blows, we never see,<br />\nbut only hear, the woman. The only image we see is a<br />\nshot of Antoine. That shot dissolves, but is followed by<br />\nan identical snot. Again, as witii Bresson, dr,tracting,<br />\nextraneous details have been stripped away, leaving<br />\nnothing but tile actor's face. For Truffaut, indeed for the<br />\n,nistory of cinema, it was a revolutionary step. Georges<br />\nFranju, in an interview with Truffaut, explains why this<br />\nsequence is the finest in what many consider Truffaut's<br />\nfinest film: \"This is the first film that ever showed a kid<br />\nhaving a four-minute conversation, with no curs to<br />\nanything else. As the person he's talking to isn't visible,<br />\nhe's speaking to tile public, the brat, he's speaking to us.\"<br /><br />\nPrice has been lecturing for eighteen years and claims<br />\nQ: Are you going to Joan Crawford's laqction<br />\nhe may be the only person w1ro knows there are 350 cities<br />\n.V.P: No. I don't want to bey her eyelashes<br />\nin this country.

Maybe the easiest<br />\nplace to start is with the factual<br />\ninformation: the records.<br />\nTim Collins, in particular, was!<br />\na record breaker in the past week'<br />\nby setting a pool and university<br />\nrecord in the 1000 meter<br />\nfreestyle with a time of 9:54<br />\nSaturday, and then breaking his<br />\nown record Wednesday night by<br />\n16 seconds. His official time was<br />\n9:38.8. There were also<br />\nuniversity records set in the 400<br />\nMedley relay by Jon Klein, Bill<br />\nSmiddy, Doug Morgan, and<br />\nFrancis Florez: the 200 freestyle<br />\nby Francis Florez and the 500<br />\nfree by Tim Collins. And that's<br />\nonly part of it.<br />\nThe performances of the team<br />\nput the Hopkins team as the,<br />\nleading team in Division III in toe<br />\nnation in the following events:<br />\n400 Medley Relay, Tim Collins in<br />\nthe 1000 and 500 free, Florez in<br />\nthe 200 free, Smiddy in the 200<br />\nIndividual Medley, and the team<br />\nis also second and third in the<br />\n200 backstroke with Doug<br />\nMorgan and Jon Klein.<br />\nProbably one of the most<br />\nexcited members of the team,<br />\nthough, would have to be Bill<br />\nSmiddy. To say that this was one<br />\nof the most important meets of<br />\nthe year for him would not be<br />\ngiving it enough emphasis.<br />\nIn the 200 breaststroke, Bill<br />\nSmiddy came in first followed by<br />\nFrosh Jon Blank. It was more<br />\nthan a simple victory, however,<br />\nfor Smiddy. His time qualified<br />\nhim for the Division I Nationals<br />\nthat will be held in Long Beach,,<br />\nCalifornia the last week in March.<br /><br />\nCoach Welsh was so sure of<br />\nSmiddy's ability to qualify that<br />\nhe confirmed the hotel<br />\nreservations last week.<br />\nWelsh said: \"He set a<br />\nuniversity record, a pool record<br />\nand further established his lead in<br />\nthe Nation in Division III. By<br />\nqualifying for Division I he will<br />\nbe competing with the best in the:<br />\ncountry.\" The Division I cuts,.<br />\nhe added, are amazingly tough.<br />\nThey are designed to limit the<br />\nnumber of swimmers in the<br />\ncountry to 40 in the 200<br />\nbreaststroke.<br />\nThe pivotal event in the meet<br />\ncould easily be pinned as the 100'<br />\nfreestyle. Welsh saw the victory<br />\nas unexpected. Maryland should<br />\nhave won, but Francis Florez<br />\nmanaged to pull it out for the<br />\nteam and with that event bring<br />\nvictory a little closer to a_reality.<br />\nThe event that preceeded the<br />\n100 freestyle was the 200<br />\nbutterfly which was a toss up,<br />\nbut Maryland came out on top.<br />\nCoach Welsh adds that \"If<br />\nMaryland had then gone 1-2 in<br />\nthe 100 freestyle, the meet<br />\nwould have been over right<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nTim Collins' victory in the<br />\n1000 freestyle was also a major<br />\nvictory.Welsh feels that with his<br />\nperformance no one in the<br />\nEastern United States would have<br />\nbeen able to beat him.<br />\nJon Klein also gave an<br />\nimportant assist in the relay by<br />\ndelivering in the Medley Relay.<br />\nThe backstroke was the key to a<br />\nvictory in this event and it was<br />\nimperative that Hopkins win this<br />\nevent. The Hopkins team finished<br />\nfirst with participation by Klein,<br />\nSmiddy, Morgan, and Florez.<br />\nThe actual results of the meet<br />\nwere so astounding that it is<br />\npossible to list tile particulars<br />\nforever, but it is just as important<br />\nto realize what the meet meant<br />\nto the team. Primarily, it was the<br />\nfirst time ever that Hopkins has<br />\nbeen victorious over the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland team.<br />\nWelsh sees the actual victory as<br />\nastounding and the way in which<br />\nthe team pulled itself together<br />\nfor the meet. \"They really got<br /><br />\nLi<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Aquamen<br />\npsyched. My job as coach<br />\nnecessarily begins and ends at the<br />\npool, but these kids see each<br />\nother every day. They got each<br />\nother so up for the meet that 1<br />\ncould see their own excitement<br />\nbuilding.\"<br />\nAs a dual meet it was<br />\ndefinitely, in the eyes of the<br />\ncoach, and anyone who had the<br />\nthrill of watching, the biggest<br />\nmeet of the year. The stands at<br />\nthe Athletic Center were filled<br />\nand the encouragement of the<br />\ncrowd must certainly be cited as<br />\nan encouraging factor in the<br />\nvictory.<br />\nTim Welsh was quick to give<br />\ncredit where it was due and could<br />\nnot help thanking the Assistant<br />\nCoach, Josii Treem who was a<br />\nformer Hopkins swimmer. Welsh<br />\nsaid, \"His support held us<br />\ntogether. His encouragement and<br />\nstability was a definite factor in<br />\nthe victory.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins team worked<br />\nhard fot this victory and they<br />\nmost certainly deserved it. All of<br />\nthe morning workouts and<br />\npractices since October have<br />\nculminated in a superb dual<br />\nmeet. Francis Florez summed up<br />\nthe sentiments of toe entire team<br />\nwhen he said at the end of the<br />\nmeet, \"This is the feeling that \u2022<br />\nmakes swimming worthwhile.\"<br /><br />\nVirgin win at Goucher<br />\nBY RON BIALEK<br />\nCrushing vicotries are not the<br />\nusual natur,<br />\n: of. the Blue Jay<br />\nWomen's Basketball team.<br />\nTuesday evening was different.<br />\nCrushing is the only way to<br />\ndescribe Hopkins 48-25 win over<br />\ntheir weaker opponent, Goucher<br />\nCollege.<br />\nHopkins came out early in<br />\ndecisive fashion looking for the<br />\nfast break and applying- a tough<br />\nfull court press. With four<br />\nminutes gone in the half,<br />\nGoucher took a 4-2 lead, but this<br />\nwas the only time they were to<br />\nbe found on top.<br />\nBoth ends of the court were<br />\ndominated by the Blue Jay<br />\nsquad. Carole Stafford and Chris<br />\nRanum pulled down rebound<br />\nafter rebound, giving their<br />\noffense three, four and even five<br />\nshots each time down the court.<br />\nIn the first half, Joanne Engler<br />\nled the offensive attack with 10<br />\npoints and a fine display of<br />\noutside shooting. Passes were<br />\ncrisp and found their way to the<br />\nopen players.<br />\nThe second half witnessed<br />\nmuch of the same play.
