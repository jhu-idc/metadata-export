There<br />\nhad been an insistent call for a<br />\nnumber of years from the alumni<br />\nthat the University be moved to<br />\nHomewood.

It<br />\nwill also afford a splendid opportunity to pay fit tribute to<br />\nalumni who have, returned from<br />\nthe war and to welcome them.<br />\nThe plans for the reunion are<br />\nstill somewhat incomplete. They<br />\nwill include an inspection of<br />\nHomewood by the alumni, memorial exercises to the dead and<br />\nthe erection of a memorial tablet.<br />\nA number of features of a lighter<br />\nnature will be incorporated; for<br />\ninstance, a lacrosse game with<br />\nthe University of Toronto a baseball game, a smoker at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club, a review of the R.<br />\n0.

A number<br />\nof very interesting features are<br />\nplanned, however, for the interval<br />\nbetween that date and the commencement on June 24.

Aldred Lecture was on the subject of \"Ore<br />\nDocks on the Great Lakes,\" and<br />\nwas given by Mr..John E. Greiner,<br />\nconsulting engineer of this city.<br />\nThe chief topics dwelt upon were<br />\nthe expansion of the ore-handling<br />\nbusiness, the construction of the<br />\ndocks (both loading and unloading) and the types of unloading<br />\nmachinery.<br />\nThe speaker began with saying<br />\nthat the Sault Ste Marie Canal increased the shipments of ore from<br />\n1,450 tons to 36,000 in one year,<br />\nand that last year the output had<br />\nincreased to 61,000,000 tons. Most<br />\nof the deposits are along the<br />\nsouthern shore of Lake Superior;<br />\nhence, the docks there are of the<br />\nloading kind, with high bins and<br />\nchutes to deliver the ore by gravity into the holds of the steamers.<br />\nThe unloading docks along<br />\nLakes Michigan, Erie and Huron<br />\nhave huge scoops and buckets for<br />\nlifting the ore from the holds of\u2022<br />\nthe steamers and depositing it<br />\nupon storage piles or in cars. The<br />\nscoops act like giant hands, turning and twisting into every corner, under the control of the driver, who sometimes sits in a compartment on the scoop and sometimes on the crane.<br />\nThis field of engineering, which<br />\nincludes the design of docks and<br />\ntheir machinery, and the operation<br />\nand upkeep of the same, is still<br />\nin its infancy. The rapid growth<br />\nbefore the war and the wide possibilities of development in the future will afford many openings<br />\nfor the young engineers.<br />\n<br />\nAt Pennsylvania the membership in the Athletic Association<br />\nwill be compulsory, and the fees<br />\nwill constitute a part of the college entrarrce charges.<br />\n* * *<br />\nVassar and Wellesley freshmen<br />\neach have started a literary sheet<br />\nof their own.

Three of the main features<br />\non the program are a thorough<br />\ninspection of the Homewood<br />\nbuildings by the alumni, many<br />\nof whom have never seen Hopkins in its up-town home; memorial exercises, including the<br />\nerection of a memorial tablet to<br />\nthe dead; and a welcome to Hopkins' sons who have returned<br />\nfrom overseas.<br />\nThe alumni long advocated the<br />\nchange of site from down-town<br />\nto Homewood; and now they, will<br />\nhave a chance to see what is still<br />\nneeded in the way of buildings<br />\nand equipment. The lack of adequate dormitories, a gym, laboratory buildings and the like, will<br />\nimmediately be apparent. The<br />\nalumni are seeking a permanent<br />\nmemorial for Hopkins men who<br />\nmade the supreme sacrifice.<br />\nWhat could be more suitable than<br />\na memorial dormitory or gymnasium?<br />\nIt would be fitting for the present to have tablets to perpetuate<br />\nthe memory of those who gave<br />\ntheir lives, but in the near future<br />\na memorial building should by all<br />\nmeans be erected. Princeton is<br />\nconsidering for this purpose a<br />\nchapel; Washington and Lee, an<br />\narch, and Lehigh is carrying on<br />\na most successful campaign for a<br />\n<br />\nmemorial administration building, the first $100,000 having been<br />\ncontributed by fifty men. The<br />\nHopkins alumni are looked to to<br />\nhelp put the thing across for us;<br />\nand the reunion in June will<br />\nprobably start a Hopkins memorial campaign.<br />\nThe reunion plans and the<br />\nnames of prominent alumni and<br />\nofficials who will attend the reunion appear in another part of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER. Mr. George<br />\nRadcliffe, president of the Alumni<br />\nAssociation, is exerting every effort for the success of the alumni<br />\nget-together. The students and<br />\nfaculty, by their co-operation and<br />\nenthusiasm, can do much to aid<br />\nhim and the committees in<br />\ncharge. We should lend our aid<br />\nin every way toward making the<br />\nexercises in June one of the greatest events in the history of the<br />\nUniversity. The NEWS-LETTER IS<br />\nplanning to do its part by issuing<br />\na special alumni number to be<br />\nsent to all parts of the country,<br />\nwith the intention of interesting<br />\nthe alumni.<br />\nThe reunion, which will last<br />\nthrough commencement, will tend<br />\nto make the finals this year more<br />\neventful. More elaborate finals<br />\ntraditions would certainly be<br />\nmost beneficial to Hopkins. The<br />\nPrinceton finals, for example,<br />\nwith their combination of dignity,<br />\nimpressiveness and gaiety, are<br />\nthe crowning event of the year.<br />\nEvery class with surviving members returns to pay homage to its<br />\nAlma Mater. Each class has<br />\nits separate headquarters, where<br />\nsong and reminiscence\u2014and in<br />\nthe future, Bevo \u2014 hold sway.<br />\nSocial events for both undergraduates and older men crowd the<br />\ncalendar. The alumni thus renew their zeal for Princeton and<br />\nform a veritable army to back it<br />\nfinancially and in every other<br />\nway.<br />\nHere at Hopkins, however, the<br />\ntermination of the final exams<br />\nmarks the closing of the year for<br />\nmany. When the last dread<br />\nordeal is a thing of the past, they<br />\nimmediately repair to home or<br />\nresort. We hope that the coming<br />\nAlumni Reunion will be a forerunner of real Hopkins finals, in<br />\nwhich every class since the founding of the University and every<br />\nundergraduate will take an active<br />\npart.<br />\nWere You There?<br />\n<br />\nThe performance of the track<br />\nartists and stickmen Saturday<br />\ndeserved better attendance. The<br />\nfair-weather rooters evidently<br />\npreferred the sheltering coziness<br />\nof some tea emporium to the cold<br />\ndrizzle of Homewood field\u2014or,<br />\nperhaps, hearing at Friday's<br />\nmass-meeting of the fate of all<br />\nhead-gears not of the straw variety, and fearing the rain's effect on their new Knox, they just<br />\ndidn't know what to wear. At<br />\nall events, they would have been<br />\n'rewarded for any trouble just to<br />\nhave witnessed the lacrosse game,<br />\n<br />\nwhich resulted in such a fiasco<br />\nfor the Philadelphians. If the<br />\nBlack and Blue stickmen can repeat next Saturday against<br />\nLehigh, they will again bring the<br />\nchampionship to Hopkins.<br />\nThe names of the nominees for<br />\nelection to the G. A. A., appear<br />\nelsewhere in the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nConsider them carefully and don't<br />\nfail to be present at the massmeeting Thursday.

E. building on<br />\nThursday, May 8th, for the purposes of collecting money for the<br />\nband, and for arranging a program for Senior Week. After<br />\ndiscussing the latter proposition<br />\nat length without arriving at a<br />\nconclusion, the class decided that<br />\na committee should be appointed to investigate the matter.<br />\nHooper, Stanley, Schmidt, Hancock and Tull were appointed,<br />\nand these men are expected to<br />\nhave a report ready next week.<br />\nCarneal, the chairman of the banquet committee announced that<br />\nhis committee held a balance of<br />\nabout $12.00, which would go toward defraying the expenses of the<br />\ncoining festivities. The president,<br />\nin a touching little speech,<br />\nthanked Mr. Carneal and the<br />\ncommittee for their efforts on<br />\nbehalf of the class.<br />\nThe class then decided that a<br />\npetition to the Board of Collegiate Studies, should be drawn<br />\nup, to exempt seniors, whose records have been creditable, from<br />\nfinal examination. Hooper was<br />\nauthorized to write such a petition, and to present it to all seniors for their signatures. The<br />\npetition has already been passed<br />\naround; the reasons given are<br />\nfirst, the collegiate year ends so<br />\nlate that the additional time required for .examinations will interfere with future plans; and,<br />\nsecond, that final examinations<br />\nare deemed unnecessary for seniors who have done well in the<br />\npast.<br />\n<br />\n--With that<br />\nsomething<br />\nthat college<br />\nmen like<br />\n<br />\ne 41:3 Hub<br />\nBaltimore Street At Charles<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF<br />\nFOR COMING YEAR ELECTED.<br />\n<br />\nJohn H.

The acting of all the members of the cast was excellent,<br />\nand, in particular, the men impersonating female characters<br />\nseemed made for their roles.<br />\nThe play was produced under<br />\nthe personal direction of Miss<br />\nClementine Walter, whose remarkable talents and untiring efforts made the performance possible. She not only coached the<br />\nmen with infinite patience, but she<br />\nalso designed the costumes.<br />\nThe character of the philosophic<br />\nwaiter, filled by George U. Carneal,required great histrionic ability. To impersonate a man seventy years of age, of inferior social<br />\nstanding, the confidante of so obstrepterous a family, who grasps<br />\nevery situation with consummate<br />\ntact, is a part for a professional<br />\nof no common powers. The acting<br />\nof Carneal, however, could hardly<br />\nhave been improved upon.<br />\nThe female characters were very<br />\nnatural, but caused convulsions of<br />\nlaughter throughout the audience.<br />\nJohn Lewin, with his mincing<br />\ngestures, dainty form and falsetto<br />\nvoice, was a wonderful twentieth<br />\ncentury mother, while Edward<br />\nNorris, his daughter, not only<br />\nstole the heart of the hero, but incidentally broke those important<br />\norgans of the male members of<br />\nthe audience.

We all<br />\nrecognize that lacrosse is the<br />\ngame in which Hopkins specializes<br />\nand excels. No one will deny<br />\nthat lacrosse is one of the prettiest games played, but the fact<br />\nremains that at most institutions<br />\nit is.unknown, or at best a minor<br />\nsport. At several colleges and<br />\nuniversities it is true that it is a<br />\nmajor sport, but at perhaps none<br />\nis it given as much preference as<br />\nhere. In order to draw public<br />\nattention we must cater to public taste, and at present public<br />\ntaste is not fondest of lacrosse. To<br />\nbring honor to the Black and<br />\nBlue we cannot afford to sacrifice track, tennis, baseball, and<br />\neven football, to a game which is<br />\nconsidered less important. To<br />\novercome this prevalent difficulty<br />\none of two things must be done:<br />\neither we must persuade more<br />\ncolleges and universities to adopt<br />\nlacrosse as their big spring game,<br />\nor we must stop giving our best<br />\nmaterial to a game which we all<br />\nlove, but which does not do the<br />\nutmost good for Hopkins.<br />\nSurely one or the other of these<br />\ncourses could be adopted, and the<br />\nadditional publicity either would<br />\ncast on Hopkins would without a<br />\ndoubt justify whatever sacrifice<br />\nwould be entailed.<br />\nG.F. N.<br />\nHOPKINS FRESHMEN TRY<br />\nTO OUT RIVAL JULES VERNE.<br />\n<br />\nTwo Hopkins freshmen had a<br />\nunique experience when they<br />\nstarted off in the cross-country<br />\nVictory Loan Balloon, which was<br />\ncast loose at the sunken gardens<br />\non St. Paul street on May 6. It<br />\nwas a real hydrogen-gas balloon,<br />\npropelled only by the gentle<br />\nbreezes, carrying besides the pilot<br />\nfour enthusiastic passengers, including \"Star\" Lovell and John<br />\nMarkel'. The greatest thrill of<br />\nall was the getting off, for as<br />\nthere were many candidates<br />\naround the balloon with $10,000<br />\nworth of bonds, lots had to be<br />\ndrawn.<br />\nIn five minutes from the time<br />\nwhen the lines were cast loose, the<br />\nballoon was 5,500 feet in the air,<br />\nand kept going up at the same<br />\nrate until it was far above the<br />\nclouds. The aerial travelers, after being up fifty-five minutes,<br />\n<br />\nTwo very pretty girls met on<br />\nthe street and kissed each other<br />\nrapturously. Two young men<br />\nwatched the meeting. \"There's<br />\nanother of those things that are<br />\nso unfair,\" said one.<br />\n\"What is that?\" said his friend.<br />\nHe pointed to the scene: \"Women<br />\ndoing men's work.\"\u2014Ex.<br />\nexperiencing many thrills and<br />\nfor a lono. time believing that<br />\nthey were6headed for the Chesapeake Bay, came down and finally<br />\nlanded near Pimlico.<br />\n\"I had an irresistable desire to<br />\nyank on that red cord when we<br />\nwere way up there,\" said the<br />\n\"Admiral\" to John, when they<br />\nwere safe back on Mother Earth.<br />\n\"It's a good thing you didn't,\"<br />\nsaid the other, \"that was the rip<br />\ncord. As for me, I never wanted<br />\nto light a cigarette more in my<br />\nlife than wh.,n we were under<br />\nthat hydrogen gas.\"<br />\nThe loneliness of the situation<br />\nover a mile up is what impressed<br />\nthe travelers most. For that reason, their friends have had to<br />\nlisten to their experiences ever<br />\nsince the event.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nHAT TIPS<br />\n<br />\nThe man who \"hates to buy a<br />\nProfessor Gildersleeve, classic<br />\nhat\" will find the experience<br />\nscholar of world-wide fame; Mr.<br />\na pleasant one here.

This<br />\nwill be the first gathering of former Hopkins men since the move<br />\nto Homewood was made. There<br />\nhad been an insistent call for a<br />\nnumber of years from the alumni<br />\nthat the University be moved to<br />\nHomewood. They will now have<br />\nan opportunity to see what a<br />\nsplendid start has been made by<br />\nthe University in that direction<br />\nand to form an impression as to<br />\nwhat there is yet to be done to<br />\ncomplete the job.<br />\nThe principal reason for having<br />\na reunion at this time is that it<br />\nis a most appropriate time for all<br />\nto unite in memorial exercises to<br />\nthose of the alumni who have lost<br />\ntheir lives in the World War. It<br />\nwill also afford a splendid opportunity to pay fit tribute to<br />\nalumni who have, returned from<br />\nthe war and to welcome them.<br />\nThe plans for the reunion are<br />\nstill somewhat incomplete. They<br />\nwill include an inspection of<br />\nHomewood by the alumni, memorial exercises to the dead and<br />\nthe erection of a memorial tablet.<br />\nA number of features of a lighter<br />\nnature will be incorporated; for<br />\ninstance, a lacrosse game with<br />\nthe University of Toronto a baseball game, a smoker at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club, a review of the R.<br />\n0. T. C. battalion, class and department dinners and reunions.<br />\nTheoretically speaking, the reunion will come to an end Saturday night, June 21. A number<br />\nof very interesting features are<br />\nplanned, however, for the interval<br />\nbetween that date and the commencement on June 24. A number of very prominent officials of<br />\nthe United States and Canada<br />\nwill be present at this time<br />\ntime, and<br />\na cable was sent to Dr.<br />\nwho is now in Europe, to endeavor to secure the presence of<br />\nDr. Osler.<br />\nIf the Peace Conference does<br />\nnot interfere, the committee plans<br />\nto have present at the meeting. President Wilson, Secretary<br />\nBaker, both Hopkins alumni, and<br />\nalso the Prime Minister of Canada.<br />\nAmong the alumni who are expected to be present, are men of<br />\nnational reputation in their respective fields of work, such as<br /><br />\nAgainst a field of the best athletes in the South, the Black and<br />\nBlue squad amassed a total of<br />\n561/2 points and tied Georgetown<br />\nin the South. Atlantic Intercollegiate Championships held Saturday on Homewood Field. The<br />\nsix highest point winners for<br />\nHopkins were: B. Smith, 10<br />\npoints; G. Leadbetter, 10; W. V.<br />\nEvans, 51/2; J. Bartels, 5; W.<br />\nDriver, 5; B. VanNess, 5.<br />\nBeverly Smith provided the<br />\nsensation for the meet when he<br />\nran the quarter mile in 51 seconds flat over a soggy track. He<br />\nnot only lowered the Hopkins<br />\nrecord, but showed that he will<br />\nbe a close competitor for the collegiate record in the I. C. A. A.<br />\nA. A. on May 31. Taking the<br />\nlead at the start, Bev crossed the<br />\nline twenty yards ahead of McClure of V. P. I. After winning<br />\nthe 440, Smith came back and<br />\ntook first honors in the half mile,<br />\ndrawing out from third place on<br />\nthe last turn with a sprint which<br />\nbrought him across the finish<br />\nwith a safe margin.<br />\nGuy Leadbetter won his two<br />\nfirst places again, none of the<br />\nother entries being able to compete with him in the shot or<br />\ndiscus. In the coming Lafayette<br />\nmeet, Leadbetter may be counted<br />\nupon for a third first, as the hammer throw another of his specialthe list for that meet.<br />\nties, is on'<br />\nIn the distant events, Hopkins<br />\nhad things all her own way.<br />\nSmith took first in the half mile.<br />\nDriver coming in for a third,<br />\nwith L.

Norwood placed fifth in the<br />\nsame event.<br />\nIn the two-mile run, Mullikin<br />\nled until Grave his team-mate,<br />\npassed him on the fifth lap; at<br />\nthe last turn on the final round,_<br />\nboth men droped back a place<br />\nwhen Linkin of V.

Aldred Lecture was on the subject of \"Ore<br />\nDocks on the Great Lakes,\" and<br />\nwas given by Mr..John E. Greiner,<br />\nconsulting engineer of this city.<br />\nThe chief topics dwelt upon were<br />\nthe expansion of the ore-handling<br />\nbusiness, the construction of the<br />\ndocks (both loading and unloading) and the types of unloading<br />\nmachinery.<br />\nThe speaker began with saying<br />\nthat the Sault Ste Marie Canal increased the shipments of ore from<br />\n1,450 tons to 36,000 in one year,<br />\nand that last year the output had<br />\nincreased to 61,000,000 tons. Most<br />\nof the deposits are along the<br />\nsouthern shore of Lake Superior;<br />\nhence, the docks there are of the<br />\nloading kind, with high bins and<br />\nchutes to deliver the ore by gravity into the holds of the steamers.<br />\nThe unloading docks along<br />\nLakes Michigan, Erie and Huron<br />\nhave huge scoops and buckets for<br />\nlifting the ore from the holds of\u2022<br />\nthe steamers and depositing it<br />\nupon storage piles or in cars. The<br />\nscoops act like giant hands, turning and twisting into every corner, under the control of the driver, who sometimes sits in a compartment on the scoop and sometimes on the crane.<br />\nThis field of engineering, which<br />\nincludes the design of docks and<br />\ntheir machinery, and the operation<br />\nand upkeep of the same, is still<br />\nin its infancy. The rapid growth<br />\nbefore the war and the wide possibilities of development in the future will afford many openings<br />\nfor the young engineers.<br /><br />\nAt Pennsylvania the membership in the Athletic Association<br />\nwill be compulsory, and the fees<br />\nwill constitute a part of the college entrarrce charges.<br />\n* * *<br />\nVassar and Wellesley freshmen<br />\neach have started a literary sheet<br />\nof their own.

Three of the main features<br />\non the program are a thorough<br />\ninspection of the Homewood<br />\nbuildings by the alumni, many<br />\nof whom have never seen Hopkins in its up-town home; memorial exercises, including the<br />\nerection of a memorial tablet to<br />\nthe dead; and a welcome to Hopkins' sons who have returned<br />\nfrom overseas.<br />\nThe alumni long advocated the<br />\nchange of site from down-town<br />\nto Homewood; and now they, will<br />\nhave a chance to see what is still<br />\nneeded in the way of buildings<br />\nand equipment. The lack of adequate dormitories, a gym, laboratory buildings and the like, will<br />\nimmediately be apparent. The<br />\nalumni are seeking a permanent<br />\nmemorial for Hopkins men who<br />\nmade the supreme sacrifice.<br />\nWhat could be more suitable than<br />\na memorial dormitory or gymnasium?<br />\nIt would be fitting for the present to have tablets to perpetuate<br />\nthe memory of those who gave<br />\ntheir lives, but in the near future<br />\na memorial building should by all<br />\nmeans be erected. Princeton is<br />\nconsidering for this purpose a<br />\nchapel; Washington and Lee, an<br />\narch, and Lehigh is carrying on<br />\na most successful campaign for a<br /><br />\nmemorial administration building, the first $100,000 having been<br />\ncontributed by fifty men. The<br />\nHopkins alumni are looked to to<br />\nhelp put the thing across for us;<br />\nand the reunion in June will<br />\nprobably start a Hopkins memorial campaign.<br />\nThe reunion plans and the<br />\nnames of prominent alumni and<br />\nofficials who will attend the reunion appear in another part of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER. Mr. George<br />\nRadcliffe, president of the Alumni<br />\nAssociation, is exerting every effort for the success of the alumni<br />\nget-together. The students and<br />\nfaculty, by their co-operation and<br />\nenthusiasm, can do much to aid<br />\nhim and the committees in<br />\ncharge. We should lend our aid<br />\nin every way toward making the<br />\nexercises in June one of the greatest events in the history of the<br />\nUniversity. The NEWS-LETTER IS<br />\nplanning to do its part by issuing<br />\na special alumni number to be<br />\nsent to all parts of the country,<br />\nwith the intention of interesting<br />\nthe alumni.<br />\nThe reunion, which will last<br />\nthrough commencement, will tend<br />\nto make the finals this year more<br />\neventful. More elaborate finals<br />\ntraditions would certainly be<br />\nmost beneficial to Hopkins. The<br />\nPrinceton finals, for example,<br />\nwith their combination of dignity,<br />\nimpressiveness and gaiety, are<br />\nthe crowning event of the year.<br />\nEvery class with surviving members returns to pay homage to its<br />\nAlma Mater. Each class has<br />\nits separate headquarters, where<br />\nsong and reminiscence\u2014and in<br />\nthe future, Bevo \u2014 hold sway.<br />\nSocial events for both undergraduates and older men crowd the<br />\ncalendar. The alumni thus renew their zeal for Princeton and<br />\nform a veritable army to back it<br />\nfinancially and in every other<br />\nway.<br />\nHere at Hopkins, however, the<br />\ntermination of the final exams<br />\nmarks the closing of the year for<br />\nmany. When the last dread<br />\nordeal is a thing of the past, they<br />\nimmediately repair to home or<br />\nresort. We hope that the coming<br />\nAlumni Reunion will be a forerunner of real Hopkins finals, in<br />\nwhich every class since the founding of the University and every<br />\nundergraduate will take an active<br />\npart.<br />\nWere You There?<br /><br />\nThe performance of the track<br />\nartists and stickmen Saturday<br />\ndeserved better attendance. The<br />\nfair-weather rooters evidently<br />\npreferred the sheltering coziness<br />\nof some tea emporium to the cold<br />\ndrizzle of Homewood field\u2014or,<br />\nperhaps, hearing at Friday's<br />\nmass-meeting of the fate of all<br />\nhead-gears not of the straw variety, and fearing the rain's effect on their new Knox, they just<br />\ndidn't know what to wear. At<br />\nall events, they would have been<br />\n'rewarded for any trouble just to<br />\nhave witnessed the lacrosse game,<br /><br />\nwhich resulted in such a fiasco<br />\nfor the Philadelphians. If the<br />\nBlack and Blue stickmen can repeat next Saturday against<br />\nLehigh, they will again bring the<br />\nchampionship to Hopkins.<br />\nThe names of the nominees for<br />\nelection to the G. A. A., appear<br />\nelsewhere in the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nConsider them carefully and don't<br />\nfail to be present at the massmeeting Thursday.

After<br />\ndiscussing the latter proposition<br />\nat length without arriving at a<br />\nconclusion, the class decided that<br />\na committee should be appointed to investigate the matter.<br />\nHooper, Stanley, Schmidt, Hancock and Tull were appointed,<br />\nand these men are expected to<br />\nhave a report ready next week.<br />\nCarneal, the chairman of the banquet committee announced that<br />\nhis committee held a balance of<br />\nabout $12.00, which would go toward defraying the expenses of the<br />\ncoining festivities. The president,<br />\nin a touching little speech,<br />\nthanked Mr. Carneal and the<br />\ncommittee for their efforts on<br />\nbehalf of the class.<br />\nThe class then decided that a<br />\npetition to the Board of Collegiate Studies, should be drawn<br />\nup, to exempt seniors, whose records have been creditable, from<br />\nfinal examination. Hooper was<br />\nauthorized to write such a petition, and to present it to all seniors for their signatures. The<br />\npetition has already been passed<br />\naround; the reasons given are<br />\nfirst, the collegiate year ends so<br />\nlate that the additional time required for .examinations will interfere with future plans; and,<br />\nsecond, that final examinations<br />\nare deemed unnecessary for seniors who have done well in the<br />\npast.<br /><br />\n--With that<br />\nsomething<br />\nthat college<br />\nmen like<br /><br />\ne 41:3 Hub<br />\nBaltimore Street At Charles<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF<br />\nFOR COMING YEAR ELECTED.<br /><br />\nJohn H.

The acting of all the members of the cast was excellent,<br />\nand, in particular, the men impersonating female characters<br />\nseemed made for their roles.<br />\nThe play was produced under<br />\nthe personal direction of Miss<br />\nClementine Walter, whose remarkable talents and untiring efforts made the performance possible. She not only coached the<br />\nmen with infinite patience, but she<br />\nalso designed the costumes.<br />\nThe character of the philosophic<br />\nwaiter, filled by George U.

We all<br />\nrecognize that lacrosse is the<br />\ngame in which Hopkins specializes<br />\nand excels. No one will deny<br />\nthat lacrosse is one of the prettiest games played, but the fact<br />\nremains that at most institutions<br />\nit is.unknown, or at best a minor<br />\nsport. At several colleges and<br />\nuniversities it is true that it is a<br />\nmajor sport, but at perhaps none<br />\nis it given as much preference as<br />\nhere. In order to draw public<br />\nattention we must cater to public taste, and at present public<br />\ntaste is not fondest of lacrosse. To<br />\nbring honor to the Black and<br />\nBlue we cannot afford to sacrifice track, tennis, baseball, and<br />\neven football, to a game which is<br />\nconsidered less important. To<br />\novercome this prevalent difficulty<br />\none of two things must be done:<br />\neither we must persuade more<br />\ncolleges and universities to adopt<br />\nlacrosse as their big spring game,<br />\nor we must stop giving our best<br />\nmaterial to a game which we all<br />\nlove, but which does not do the<br />\nutmost good for Hopkins.<br />\nSurely one or the other of these<br />\ncourses could be adopted, and the<br />\nadditional publicity either would<br />\ncast on Hopkins would without a<br />\ndoubt justify whatever sacrifice<br />\nwould be entailed.<br />\nG.F. N.<br />\nHOPKINS FRESHMEN TRY<br />\nTO OUT RIVAL JULES VERNE.<br /><br />\nTwo Hopkins freshmen had a<br />\nunique experience when they<br />\nstarted off in the cross-country<br />\nVictory Loan Balloon, which was<br />\ncast loose at the sunken gardens<br />\non St. Paul street on May 6. It<br />\nwas a real hydrogen-gas balloon,<br />\npropelled only by the gentle<br />\nbreezes, carrying besides the pilot<br />\nfour enthusiastic passengers, including \"Star\" Lovell and John<br />\nMarkel'. The greatest thrill of<br />\nall was the getting off, for as<br />\nthere were many candidates<br />\naround the balloon with $10,000<br />\nworth of bonds, lots had to be<br />\ndrawn.<br />\nIn five minutes from the time<br />\nwhen the lines were cast loose, the<br />\nballoon was 5,500 feet in the air,<br />\nand kept going up at the same<br />\nrate until it was far above the<br />\nclouds. The aerial travelers, after being up fifty-five minutes,<br /><br />\nTwo very pretty girls met on<br />\nthe street and kissed each other<br />\nrapturously. Two young men<br />\nwatched the meeting. \"There's<br />\nanother of those things that are<br />\nso unfair,\" said one.<br />\n\"What is that?\" said his friend.<br />\nHe pointed to the scene: \"Women<br />\ndoing men's work.\"\u2014Ex.<br />\nexperiencing many thrills and<br />\nfor a lono. time believing that<br />\nthey were6headed for the Chesapeake Bay, came down and finally<br />\nlanded near Pimlico.<br />\n\"I had an irresistable desire to<br />\nyank on that red cord when we<br />\nwere way up there,\" said the<br />\n\"Admiral\" to John, when they<br />\nwere safe back on Mother Earth.<br />\n\"It's a good thing you didn't,\"<br />\nsaid the other, \"that was the rip<br />\ncord.
