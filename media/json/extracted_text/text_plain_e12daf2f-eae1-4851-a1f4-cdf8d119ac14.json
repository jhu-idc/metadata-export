Jerry Maley learned<br />\na great deal about computers in a very short time. Incidentally,this small calculator has gone into production.<br />\n\"It makes an engineer feel good,\" he says, \"to see his<br />\nproject reach the production stage\u2014and to be able to<br />\nfollow it through.\"<br />\nPromoted to Associate Engineer after sixteen months;<br />\nhe became the leader of a nine-man team, assigning<br />\nproblems to his group for solution, approving their<br />\nblock diagrams and the models they built. A short<br />\nwhile ago, he was again promoted\u2014 this time to<br />\nProject Engineer. \"A<br />\nparticularly interesting<br />\naspect of my present<br />\njob,\" Jerry Maley says,<br />\n\"is the further development of magnetic<br />\ncores\u2014new memory<br />\nstorage devices for electronic digital computers.\" His administrative details have been<br />\nreduced to a minimum, freeing him for creative<br />\nAssigning problem to group member engineering work.<br />\nPerhaps an hour a day goes into paper work such as<br />\nrequisitioning equipment for his group and reviewing<br />\ntechnical publications, in counseling members of his<br />\nteam, and preparing for trips to technical society<br />\nmeetings.<br />\n<br />\nWhy he chose IBM<br />\nOf course, there were many reasons why Jerry Maley<br />\nselected IBM. He was vitally interested in computers,<br />\nand IBM is a leader in computer technology. He comes<br />\nfrom a scientific family (his brother is a mathematician),<br />\nand is fascinated by these IBM mathematical marvels<br />\nwhich are revolutionizing ways of doing things in so<br />\nmany fields. He enjoys working on large equipment...<br />\nand on \"pulses.\"\"It's more logical,\" he says.\"In computer work, you can actually see electronics at work.<br />\nAnd it's not all solid math, either. What's more, this<br />\n<br />\nIBM?<br />\n<br />\nfield is so new, you're contributing along with everybody else in a short time.\" He endorses the IBM<br />\npolicy of promoting<br />\nfrom within, with merit t<br />\nthe sole criterion. The<br />\nsalary factor, although<br />\nit was excellent, was<br />\nnot his first employment consideration, he<br />\nrecalls. The tremendous advancement po,<br />\ntential was of greater<br />\nTesting a new development<br />\nimportance.<br />\n<br />\nWhat about promotions?<br />\nWhen asked about advancement opportunities at IBM,<br />\nhe says,\"You can hardly miss in this field and in this<br />\ncompany. IBM sales have doubled, on the average,<br />\nevery five years. Company expansion at this rate\u2014<br />\nin a dynamic industry\u2014<br />\nmakes my future look<br />\nbright indeed.\" Since<br />\nJerry Maley came<br />\nwith IBM in 1953,<br />\ncareer opportunities<br />\nat IBM are brighter<br />\nthan ever, as all business, industry, science<br />\nand government turn<br />\nincreasingly to automation through elecReviewing technical publications<br />\ntronic computers.<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThis profile is just one example of what it's like to be<br />\nwith IBM.

Maley,like<br />\nmany other engineers, mathematicians and physicists,<br />\ncame to IBM directly from college. Here he tells how<br />\nhe put his E.E. degree to work in the exciting new field<br />\nof computer development.<br /><br />\nWhat's it like to be with<br />\n\"What really sold me,\" says Gerald Maley, \"was the<br />\nway they approach engineering at IBM.I had expected<br />\nrooms full of engineers at desks. Instead,I found all the<br />\nfriendly informality of my college lab.\"<br />\nAn E.E., he came directly to IBM from the University<br />\nof Buffalo in 1953. Starting as a Technical Engineer,<br />\nhe was immediately assigned to work, with two others,<br />\non designing a small calculator. Jerry Maley learned<br />\na great deal about computers in a very short time. Incidentally,this small calculator has gone into production.<br />\n\"It makes an engineer feel good,\" he says, \"to see his<br />\nproject reach the production stage\u2014and to be able to<br />\nfollow it through.\"<br />\nPromoted to Associate Engineer after sixteen months;<br />\nhe became the leader of a nine-man team, assigning<br />\nproblems to his group for solution, approving their<br />\nblock diagrams and the models they built. A short<br />\nwhile ago, he was again promoted\u2014 this time to<br />\nProject Engineer. \"A<br />\nparticularly interesting<br />\naspect of my present<br />\njob,\" Jerry Maley says,<br />\n\"is the further development of magnetic<br />\ncores\u2014new memory<br />\nstorage devices for electronic digital computers.\" His administrative details have been<br />\nreduced to a minimum, freeing him for creative<br />\nAssigning problem to group member engineering work.<br />\nPerhaps an hour a day goes into paper work such as<br />\nrequisitioning equipment for his group and reviewing<br />\ntechnical publications, in counseling members of his<br />\nteam, and preparing for trips to technical society<br />\nmeetings.<br /><br />\nWhy he chose IBM<br />\nOf course, there were many reasons why Jerry Maley<br />\nselected IBM. He was vitally interested in computers,<br />\nand IBM is a leader in computer technology. He comes<br />\nfrom a scientific family (his brother is a mathematician),<br />\nand is fascinated by these IBM mathematical marvels<br />\nwhich are revolutionizing ways of doing things in so<br />\nmany fields. He enjoys working on large equipment...<br />\nand on \"pulses.\"\"It's more logical,\" he says.\"In computer work, you can actually see electronics at work.<br />\nAnd it's not all solid math, either. What's more, this<br /><br />\nIBM?<br /><br />\nfield is so new, you're contributing along with everybody else in a short time.\" He endorses the IBM<br />\npolicy of promoting<br />\nfrom within, with merit t<br />\nthe sole criterion. The<br />\nsalary factor, although<br />\nit was excellent, was<br />\nnot his first employment consideration, he<br />\nrecalls. The tremendous advancement po,<br />\ntential was of greater<br />\nTesting a new development<br />\nimportance.<br /><br />\nWhat about promotions?<br />\nWhen asked about advancement opportunities at IBM,<br />\nhe says,\"You can hardly miss in this field and in this<br />\ncompany. IBM sales have doubled, on the average,<br />\nevery five years. Company expansion at this rate\u2014<br />\nin a dynamic industry\u2014<br />\nmakes my future look<br />\nbright indeed.\" Since<br />\nJerry Maley came<br />\nwith IBM in 1953,<br />\ncareer opportunities<br />\nat IBM are brighter<br />\nthan ever, as all business, industry, science<br />\nand government turn<br />\nincreasingly to automation through elecReviewing technical publications<br />\ntronic computers.<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThis profile is just one example of what it's like to be<br />\nwith IBM.
