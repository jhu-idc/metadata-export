In this first issue of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER the Board of Editors takes the opportunity to welcome<br />\nall the old students back as well as the Freshmen. It is not necessary to give another account of the policy of the paper, for this was<br />\nprinted in one of the issues of last spring.<br />\nHowever, one change will be made, and that is to publish instead of a story in each number, an article written by one of the<br />\nfaculty on whatever subject the author may select. For the first of<br />\nthis series of leading articles we are greatly indebted to Dr. French,<br />\nwho has written thoughtfully upon a very vital question, in which the undergraduates<br />\nespecially will be interested.<br />\nWe expect to have many other articles which will be just as important and delightful<br />\nto read. These articles if nothing more should make the students take a renewed interest in<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER. We shall also have a new cover design for each issue. These designs<br />\nwill be the product of the students, and we shall be glad to receive for the approval of the<br />\nBoard original pictures from all who draw.

Makel to succeed Mr. Wright as Business Manager.<br />\n<br />\nA friend of the University has presented to it a collection of coins formed between 1850<br />\nand 1880 by the Marquis de Molius, a Spanish diplomatist, who served as Ambassador in<br />\nParis and London. After his death it passed into the hands of Don Antonio Vives, the wellknown collector and numismatist of Madrid, from whom it was recently purchased. The<br />\ncollection comprises more than 3,000 specimens, and includes coins of the Roman Republic,<br />\n(gold, silver and copper), of the Roman Emperors, (gold, 44, silver and copper), and 837<br />\ncoins of the Iberian and Roman-Spanish cities and colonies issued prior to the reign of Caligula.<br />\nIn this series of early Spanish coins lies the chief value of the collection, many of the known<br />\nissues represented being excessively rare, and several specimens in this collection being, so far<br />\nas is known, unique. Many years would be required to form another such Spanish collection,<br />\nand it would be most difficult to secure so many well-preserved specimens. The main interest<br />\nof this primitive Spanish coinage lies in the fact that it represents early Iberian art, and that it<br />\nfurnishes the best original material for the solution of the many problems connected with the<br />\nIberian language and Iberian epigraphy.<br />\nDon Antonio Vives, the last owner of the collection, by whom it was, to some extent,<br />\nenlarged, is author of the standard work on the coinage of the Spanish Moors, \"Monedas de<br />\nlas Dinastias Arabigo-Espanolas,\" Madrid, 1893. He formed the collection of Hispano_<br />\nMoorish coins now in the National Archological Museum at Madrid, which the Spanish<br />\nGovernment bought from him for 110,000 pesetas, and he owns the best private collection of<br />\nprimitive Iberian bronzes, to which reference is made in many publications on this subject.<br />\nThe following gifts have also been received recently for the department of Botany:<br />\nFrom the Park Commissioners of Baltimore, through Superintendent Manning, cuttings<br />\nof 50 species of exotic plants and 10 young plants; from Mrs. Augustus Hoen, of Baltimore, a<br />\nsplendid specimen of Cycas revoluta and a fine clump of Strelitzia regince; from Professor H. S.<br />\nCollard, of Iowa College, formerly a Johnston Scholar of the University, a 1,000-gram chemical<br />\nbalance.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nUPPER CLASSMEN AND LOWER.<br />\nBY JOHN C. FRENCH.<br />\n<br />\nBeing an upper-classman at Hopkins may,<br />\nperhaps, be regarded as a greater honor now<br />\nthan in former years. The present seniors,<br />\ntho themselves completing a three-year course,<br />\nare as a class the last who will do so. From<br />\nnow on seniors, being separated from freshmen by a greater interval, may justly demand<br />\nthe greater respect from them, and in the<br />\ntraditional enmity between sophomores and<br />\nfreshmen, never having been the rivals of<br />\neither, they may now hold an unembarrassed<br />\nneutrality. Advice to new students as to<br />\ntheir part in college life has never been<br />\nscanty; they get kindly, wholesome words<br />\nfrom the Dean at matriculation, exhortations<br />\nfrom the captains of teams and clubs at the<br />\nopening reception, and fatherly counsel in<br />\nprivate from their advisers. Of such official<br />\npatronizing they have perhaps enough. The<br />\ntime is opportune, however, to ask that upperclassmen shall take stock of their opportunities<br />\nand look their responsibilities in the face.<br />\nThose alumni who are concerned that<br />\nstudent life at Hopkins shall be enriched<br />\nwith worthy traditions\u2014and no others\u2014look<br />\nto the upper-classmen to inaugurate and maintain them. Tho speaking as one having no<br />\nauthority, I venture to say that both faculty<br />\nand alumni would give their moral support to<br />\na greater dominance over college customs by<br />\nseniors. Let me hazard a few suggestions as<br />\nto what they would have seniors do.<br />\nWithout question, the alumni would have<br />\nseniors put away childish things. Otherwise<br />\nthey can serve no useful purpose as arbiters of<br />\ncollege affairs. A certain regrettable incident<br />\nof last year's student frivolity was all the<br />\nmore regrettable because the disturbance\u2014itself without precedent or excuse\u2014was incited<br />\nand abetted by seniors.<br />\nAgain, they would have seniors free themselves from all manner of partiality. As between freshmen and sophomores, they must be<br />\ncapable of a judicial attitude. Students expect, and rightly, that such members of the<br />\nfaculty as belong to fraternities having chapters here shall not carry the least memory of<br />\ntheir affiliations into the class room. An<br />\nequal impartiality should be possible to seniors.<br />\nThe censor of college customs must wield a<br />\nspear that knows no brother.<br />\n<br />\nIf there is to be hazing\u2014and I beg leave to<br />\nevade altogether the question whether there<br />\nshould be\u2014we should welcome some guarantee<br />\nthat it wiil not be carried beyond the limits of<br />\ngood-natured buffoonery. Is it not possible<br />\nto establish a tradition that no hazing whatever shall go on without the presence of a<br />\nSenior whose veto would be instantly respected? A referee is thought necessary when<br />\nthe parties to a sport are evenly matched.<br />\nHow much more necessary when one of them<br />\nis overborne by numbers and is expected for<br />\nthe sake of future college spirit to carry away<br />\nno rancor in his heart! . I believe there has<br />\nbeen no brutal hazing at Johns Hopkins; yet<br />\nthere have been freshmen, disposed to take<br />\ntheir hazing impersonally and as a sort of<br />\ninitiation to Hopkins life, who have carried<br />\non in bitterness the conviction that in their<br />\ncase the limits of reasonable exaction had<br />\nbeen over-stepped. It is to prevent this, as<br />\nwell as the possibility, remote as it is here,<br />\nperhaps, of physical injury thru some sophomore's excessive zeal, that I would have no<br />\nhazing except under rigid senior control.<br />\nWhere there are several fraternities and<br />\nnone too many students, rivalry becomes<br />\nkeen and abuses are likely to creep in. It is<br />\nno secret that at Hopkins some regulation of<br />\ninter-fraternity competition is needed. To the<br />\nupper-classmen, again, we look for the inauguration of reforms. This may not be a matter<br />\nfor legislation by the senior class-meeting, but<br />\na senior pan-hellenic conference might reach<br />\nconclusions to which the weight of their influence would secure acquiescence in every<br />\nchapter house.<br />\nFraternities might then<br />\nretain their dignity in the opening weeks of<br />\nthe college year and might safely spare its the<br />\nevil of pledging in infancy.<br />\nOf course, the senior's responsibility in his<br />\nfraternity does not end with the freshman's<br />\ninitiation, and it is fair to say that many older<br />\nfraternity men exercise a wholesome influence<br />\nover the rest of the chapter. Yet I believe<br />\nthey could do much more. For example, in<br />\nat least one northern college it is no uncommon thing for a senior fraternity man to call<br />\nupon a freshman's adviser to ask about the<br />\nyoungster's standing. In this way a student<br />\nwhose head is in danger of being turned by<br />\nthe new-found whirl of college pleasures may<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nbe saved a mistake he would regret. I have<br />\nknown a fraternity man to make shipwreck of<br />\nhis college course in the first few months,<br />\nwhen it semted to me that a good blowing-up<br />\nin the chapter house might have done more<br />\nfor him than the admonitions of dean and<br />\nadviser together. I see no reason why the<br />\nseniors in a fraternity should not stand in loco<br />\nparentis even to a freshman who lives in Baltimore. They should see to it that he becomes<br />\nneither an over-conscientious grind nor an<br />\nunscrupulous loafer, that he does not thru<br />\ndiffidence or indolence fail of his rightful<br />\nplace in college affairs, and that he lacks no<br />\npraise or blame that a careful older brother<br />\nwould not withhold.<br />\nMany freshmen do not, for a variety of<br />\nreasons become members of a fraternity.<br />\nThey should not on that account be neglected.<br />\nI would have the Senior class president so far<br />\npresume upon his office as to see that no<br />\nfreshman, by reason ot poverty or lack of<br />\nfriends or for any cause except wilful indifference, should remain wholly out of the current of student activities. It follows that the<br />\nsenior president should be chosen with care.<br />\nObviously, he should be man of tried tact<br />\nwith scholarship spfficient to assure him some<br />\nleisure for his task.<br />\nIn conclusion, let me offer a specific suggestion. On account of the change to a<br />\nfour-year course, the class of 1910 will have<br />\nat graduation scarcely more than a dozen or<br />\nfifteen members. In that year why not let the<br />\nHullabaloo be issued jointly by 1910 and 1911<br />\nand thereafter by the Junior Class?<br />\nNo<br />\nHullabaloo comes off the press just when its<br />\neditors intend. The result is that the seniors<br />\nare burdened at the same time with their<br />\nfinal examinations, all the details of graduating exercises, and the business affairs of<br />\nan enterprise reaching nearly a thousand<br />\ndollars. Senior year should involve less<br />\nstress rather than more. It is the last opportunity before the engrossing specialization of<br />\nprofessional school or business for the following of culture courses, for some indulgence<br />\nof intellectual whim, and for such richer and<br />\nfuller college life as I think all alumni would<br />\nhave Hopkins seniors enjoy and bequeath to<br />\nsophomores and freshmen.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nTHE CLASS RUSH.<br />\nThe official opening of the University was<br />\ncompleted on Thursday, October the eighth,<br />\nwhen there took place the sophomore-freshman ''Rush.\" The occasion was perhaps<br />\nmore in the nature of an afternoon tea than<br />\nin former years, as the ground was thickly<br />\nspread with tan-bark, this provision doing<br />\naway with much of the unpleasantness caused<br />\nby the filling of one's mouth with a superabundance of mother earth.<br />\nThe rush itself was quite a successful affair,<br />\nparticularly in the last two conflicts, when<br />\nthe contestants appeared more warmed to the<br />\nwork. The freshmen gathered at one end of<br />\nthe arena and after the sophomores had given<br />\na blood-curdling ''Hullabaloo,\" followed by a<br />\nshrill and defiant \"Gee-bee, Gee-haa\" from<br />\nthe freshmen, signal was given, the two bands<br />\nrushed towards one another, and soon were<br />\nmingled in confusion. The sight of struggling<br />\nwarriors, the waving arms and legs and the<br />\ncries of ''Rescue!\" 'Freshman!\" ''Sophie!\"<br />\nwere no less delightful to the handful of the<br />\nFaculty than to the older students who had<br />\nassembled as spectators at this feature of the<br />\nsocial activities of the University.<br />\nThe \"decision\" was given to the freshmen<br />\nby the votes of the Officials and, in our<br />\nopinion, was really deserved. Both sides are<br />\nto be commended for the entire lack of bad<br />\nfeeling, and the amount of ginger and energy<br />\nin the whole affair.<br />\nFinally, we wish to extend our sympathy<br />\nto a certain prominent professor of mathematics, who, by a miscalculation, arrived<br />\njust too late to view the conflict.<br />\n<br />\nWALTER AND HAPPY RETURN.<br />\nWalter Noir, manufacturer of the famous<br />\nHair Tonic, has returned to the University,<br />\ntogether with the no less popular \u2014 Happy.\"<br />\nNeither of these individuals appears to change<br />\nin the slightest from year to year and return<br />\nreadier than ever to polish up our chins or<br />\nshoes, as the case may be. The welcome to<br />\nthese two patriarchs of the University is so<br />\nuniVersal that it is scarcely necessary for us<br />\nto say that we rejoice at their coming.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE DEAL IN \"J. & H.\"<br />\nWall Street has had many leaders, but no<br />\none-ever had it so completely under control as<br />\nSilas Bonds.

The reason for this can probably be found in the old adage \"Nothing<br />\nsucceeds like success,\" and everyone knows<br />\nthat he has had but one failure and that even<br />\nthis was not his fault. Several stories of why<br />\nthe deal fell through are going the rounds,<br />\nbut none are correct. Mr. Bonds is too<br />\npiqued and Harry Davis is too tickle to tell<br />\nthe story in a form that will hand it down to<br />\nthe brokers of future generations as it really<br />\nwas, and so I, who am in a position to know,<br />\nfeel that, as John Henry says, \"it's up<br />\ntome.\"<br />\nOne day last autumn, Mr. Bonds was at<br />\nhis big mahogany desk, figuring out a deal in<br />\n\"railways\" by which he hoped to cripple his<br />\nalready panic-wounded opponents so completely that he would have the floor to himself for some time. As he sat there, planning<br />\ncarefully each move in the big deal, the card<br />\nof his wife's sister was brought in. Mr.<br />\nI3onds does not like to receive women in his<br />\noffice, for he feels they have no business in<br />\n\"The Street,\" but this lady's husband had<br />\nonly recently died, naming him executor.<br />\nAccordingly, Mr. Bonds felt that he must<br />\nsee her. When she was ushered in he met<br />\nher in the formally gracious way he uses towards all women, for hard, sharp business<br />\nman that he is, he has not forgotten what the<br />\nold school taught and expected.<br />\n\"Oh! Silas,\" she said, gushingly, as is her<br />\nway, \"I'm so sorry to trouble you, but really<br />\nI must see you on most important business.<br />\nYou know poor Jack didn't leave nearly as<br />\nmuch as we thought he would and I've come<br />\nto ask if you can't tell me some stock I can<br />\nbuy and sell in a day or two for more, so I<br />\ncan buy more of those bonds you are going to<br />\nget for me.\"<br />\n\"My dear Alice,\" replied Mr. Bonds,<br />\nsmiling under his grey moustache and smoking<br />\nhard so that she would not see, \"nothing is<br />\nsure in stocks and while I can probably find<br />\nyou something compartively safe still I could<br />\n<br />\nnot guarantee that all your little fortune<br />\nmight not be wiped out.\"<br />\nThis frightened her and she said so, but he<br />\nhastened to reassure her by saying, \"There<br />\nis little chance of losing all, but it is possible<br />\nthat a small loss, which would mean a good<br />\ndeal to you, might however be suffered. I<br />\nwould advise you to risk, well say, only ten<br />\nthousand. I can buy you one hundred and<br />\nfifty shares of a security I have in mind,<br />\nusing, of course, a small margin. The stock<br />\nis now selling at 81 and I am expecting it<br />\nto go to 150. I am buying all I can get myself. Are you willing to risk it?\"<br />\nShe was willing and so that morning the<br />\nhouse of Bonds & Company bought one hundred and fifty shares of Jerkwater and Huckleberry Railroad stock and entered it on the<br />\nbooks as the property of Mrs. Alice M.<br />\nFowler. Each morning after, that lady, before she even looked at the weather, the day's<br />\nbargains, or the society news, opened her<br />\nHerald at the financial page and looked for<br />\nthe cabalistic symbol `.J. & H.,\" and each<br />\nmorning she found the figures opposite were<br />\nhigher than the day before.<br />\nSilas Bonds had planned a deal in that<br />\nstock and the deal was working successfully.<br />\nFirst, he picked up all the floating shares he<br />\ncould lay his hands on and then to inflate<br />\nits price, through his agents, his employees,<br />\nhis friends, his allies, and perhaps, too, by<br />\nthe aid of a little \"washing.\" Slowly the<br />\nprice rose, point by point, half point by half<br />\npoint, till by Christmas it reached 1480.<br />\nEverything was ripe for the culmination of<br />\nthe plan: a gradual unloading of the stock on<br />\nthe market. This must be carefully done, for,<br />\nin spite of the apparent demand, it would be<br />\na very easy thing to burst the bubble, since the<br />\nstock was quoting 'way above its true value.<br />\nNo one had discovered the scheme. True,<br />\nHogan & Company held a big block, but their<br />\ngreed for the security would only catch them<br />\nthe surer in the slump that eventually was<br />\nsure to come.<br />\nThe day after Christmas, Mr. Bonds wrote<br />\nMrs. Fowler, telling her that \"J. & H.,\" in<br />\nhis opinion, had reached the limit of its soar,<br />\nand asking her permission to sell her holdings.<br />\nThat very evening Mrs. Fowler was seated at<br />\ndinner next to a Mr. Henry Davis, who, so<br />\n<br />\nAMIN<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nw5\"<br />\n<br />\ntheir hostess said, was \"in Wall Street.\"<br />\nAccordingly, during a lull in the conversation,<br />\nthe good lady told her dinner companion that<br />\nshe was the proud possessor of one hundred<br />\nand fifty shares of \"J. & H.\" Though \"shop<br />\ntalk\" is not good \"dinner talk,\" still Davis<br />\ncould not resist the temptation of asking if she<br />\nwould sell, as he was rather keen for J. & H.\"<br />\n\"Oh! yes!\" cried Mrs. Fowler, pleased<br />\nthat this intelligent and apparently prosperous<br />\nyoung broker should take such a interest in<br />\nher dealing, and anxious to display her<br />\nknowledge of the market, \"I'll sell for Silas\u2014<br />\nI mean Mr. Silas Bonds, my brother-in-law.<br />\nHe wrote me this morning that the stock had<br />\ngone as high as he could put it, and that he<br />\nwas going to sell all he had.\"<br />\nNext morning \"J. & H.\" broke with a<br />\ncrash that could be heard from the Battery<br />\nto Harlem. In ten minutes it dropped from<br />\n14972 down to 91.Tg. The intelligent and<br />\napparently prosperous young broker, who had<br />\nbeen Mrs. Fowler's confidant the evening before, was junior partner of Hogan & Company, and they, seeing a chance to pinch their<br />\nrivals hard, dumped all their \"J. & H.\" on<br />\nthe market.<br />\nThere's a postscript to the story which Mr.<br />\nBonds will not like me to tell, but it is surely<br />\npart of the history of the deal in \"J. & H.<br />\nAfter the smoke of the first explosion settled<br />\na bit, he sat down and drew a personal cheque<br />\nfor twenty-two thousand four hundred and<br />\nfive dollars in Mrs. Fowler's favor and sent it<br />\nto her, saying he had bought her stock at<br />\nH.<br />\n14972 before the break.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nsongs. These were the excuses, \"I don't<br />\nknow the words,\" and 'I can't sing.\" Both<br />\nof these are absurd. The first is scarcely<br />\nlegitimate, as the songs are printed in the<br />\nHand-Book. The second is no excuse, for in<br />\na crowd of students there must certainly be<br />\none boy that can turn a tune, and if he starts,<br />\nthe rest will follow.<br />\nNow, when Hopkins has such good songs,<br />\nit certainly seems deplorable that they are not<br />\nused. Think of the encouragement to the<br />\nteams! The players hear their classmates<br />\nurging them and naturally brace up. It may<br />\nseem odd to some that cheering can help a<br />\nteam, but it is, nevertheless, true. Nearly<br />\neveryone has heard of the Princeton song,<br />\n\"Old Nassau,\" and of the wonderful effect<br />\nthe singing of this song has in arousing and<br />\nbracing up the teams. It is marvelous. The<br />\nHopkins songs can be made to have the same<br />\neffect, if only they are sung. Therefore, this<br />\nfall, at the football games, let all the students<br />\ngather together and sing that inspiring song,<br />\n\"Our Alma Mater in Dixie Land,\" the first<br />\nlines of which are:<br />\n\"Come, stand together, we'll raise a cheer,<br />\nand wave the Black and Blue;<br />\nWe pledge our faith as loyal sons, to Hopkins<br />\nwe'll be true.\"<br />\n<br />\nWHY NOT SING THE HOPKINS SONGS<br />\nTHIS YEAR?<br />\n<br />\nAttention! all you readers,<br />\nAnd make a careful note<br />\nOf how conceit has fallen;<br />\nVanquished by the goat\u2014<br />\nNow a Freshman may be bashful,<br />\nAnd afraid that he'll obtrude,<br />\nBut a Sophomore is a creature<br />\nWho usually is rude.<br />\n<br />\nLast year the rooting was unusually good.<br />\nUnder the inspiring leadership of Purdon<br />\nWright, the boys soon caught on to all the<br />\nyells and cheered lustily, with the same vigor<br />\nwhen Hopins was losing ground as when she<br />\nwas driving the opponents down the field.<br />\nThere was, however, one thing that they<br />\ndid not do, a thing that was greatly missed by<br />\nthose who had attended the games during<br />\nprevious years\u2014they did not sing the Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nTo him its second nature,<br />\nTo bully and annoy<br />\nAny shy and timid stranger<br />\nWho is just a little boy.<br />\nAnd so it is with pleasure<br />\nThat all devour the page<br />\nOf 1911's drubbing<br />\nBy the Freshmen in the cage.<br />\n\u2014V.

It has been said that the papers<br />\nmust keep their sporting .pages full, and that<br />\nthe baseball season is just over; it has been<br />\nclaimed that this is an age of athleticism run<br />\nwild; the real reason is, however, that school is<br />\nwork and athletics is play. It goes without<br />\nsaying that a more interesting and lively<br />\nnewspaper story can be written about the<br />\nnovelties of a college education than about its<br />\nrealities, for it really is true that students<br />\nseem to pick up a football with more avidity<br />\nthan they do books.<br />\nThere is, however, a just complaint that is<br />\nmade against too much newspaper talk about<br />\nthe college athlete. I have heard it granted<br />\nreadily that too much rushing into the public<br />\neye usually achieves notoriety for a college<br />\nprofessor, but that the more a college athlete<br />\ngets his picture and his doughty deeds in<br />\nthe paper, so much the more is his school<br />\nadvertised, and his own fame increased.<br />\nHere, to my notion, lies the fallacy, and I<br />\nneed only to cite the case of Ralph Rose to<br />\nmake my point. The more advertising a man<br />\ngets, the more likely he is to think too well of<br />\nhimself, and then he gets into trouble.<br />\nCollege athletics is a big topic and an absorbing one. About that there is no question.<br />\n<br />\nBut in the arguments about the autumn sport,<br />\nfootball, there are, now and then, things said<br />\non both sides that are a bit unfair. For<br />\ninstance, there is too much stress laid on the<br />\naccident side of football. Statistics show it to<br />\nbe well down in the list of sports, when the<br />\nproportion is shown of participants and accidents. I was much struck with the detailed<br />\nstatements which were given in a Pittsburg<br />\npaper four years ago. In a certain year, 1903<br />\nor 1904, there were more deaths in West<br />\nVirginia alone during the first week of the<br />\nhunting season than there had been in football in the whole of the United States in tell<br />\nyears. And in comparison with automobile,<br />\nsteamship and railroad accidents, football is,<br />\nas the boys say, \"A squeak in a whirlwind.\"<br />\nPerhaps it is because the death or injury of a<br />\nfine, strong, young man, just at the beginning<br />\nof his career, seems so much more unnecessary<br />\nthan the same thing in automobile or railroad<br />\naccidents.<br />\nAgain, the blame for accidents is often put<br />\nwhere it does not belong. I remember the<br />\nsorrow in a certain Western college at the<br />\ndeath of a young man on the football team,<br />\nand also the bitterness of his family against<br />\nfootball. It developed very soon that the<br />\nyoung man had been doing, no matter what,<br />\nbut several things that were contrary to the<br />\ntraining agreement under which the team had<br />\nvoluntarily promised to work. When the big<br />\nscrimmage came, the young fellow was there<br />\nwith all the will and pluck he had, but his<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nstrength was undermined, and he went down.<br />\nThat kind of a fellow might as well be killed<br />\none way as another. A man will pay for dishonesty in athletics as well as anywhere else.<br />\nFootball at Johns Hopkins seems to me to<br />\nbe on a very sane basis, and for that reason<br />\nso much the more solid. On the agreement<br />\nthat a student, who was not fit to represent<br />\nhis university in scholastic lines, was not fit<br />\nto represent it in athletics, practically all the<br />\nschools in this country have the eligibility<br />\nrule based on class standing. The good faith<br />\nof one school or another has been called in<br />\nquestion, now and then, but to the honor of<br />\nJohns Hopkins be it said, that such has not<br />\nbeen the case here. The rule is right, no one<br />\nquestions that. That it often works hardships on teams is certain. But I maintain<br />\nthat this need not be true so often. Student<br />\nsentiment should and could compel the exact<br />\ncompliance with both spirit and letter of the<br />\nlaw of training. But more, the class mates,<br />\nthe fraternity brothers, or intimate friends,<br />\nshould see to it that no man on any athletic<br />\nteam is allowed to do poor work in his studies.<br />\nWhatever that man needs, help, encouragement, criticism, scorn, boycott, to stir up his<br />\nenergies or arouse his sense of shame, that is<br />\nwhat he should get from the friends whom he,<br />\nas an athlete, is representing.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has reasons enough to feel<br />\nproud of its football team this year. There<br />\nis not as large a squad out as there should be,<br />\nbut there is a fine spirit in the men who are<br />\nthere. A good many of the necessary things<br />\nthat go to make up a successful season are<br />\nours. As good a field as any in the country,<br />\na splendid grand-stand of concrete, a nucleus<br />\nof old men in the team, a good coach and a<br />\ntried one, harmony between the men and the<br />\ncoach, a growing interest in the body of<br />\nalumni. Those are nearly enough to insure<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nOne thing more is absolutely necessary,<br />\nhowever, to make a football team. That is a<br />\nsecond team. It is the second team, the<br />\nscrubs, if you will, who are not good enough<br />\nto make the team this year, who may never be<br />\ngood enough to make it, so far as that goes,<br />\nthat makes the 'varsity team. I know men<br />\nwho have played on the second team for four<br />\nyears, and never made the \"Team,\" but they<br />\n<br />\nhelped make it, and they knew it, and so did<br />\neverybody else, and the deserved credit came<br />\ntheir way. No team which plays only its<br />\nregular weekly games can hope to make a fair<br />\nshowing against a team which has a daily<br />\ngame, for, of course, that few minutes or half<br />\nhour of daily tussle with a second team accustoms the men to the chances and exigencies<br />\nof intercollegiate games.<br />\nIf everybody who could get out and help,<br />\nwould do so, would take his knocks, would<br />\nput up with the difficulties the manager often<br />\nhas with clothes and shoes, would do his level<br />\nbest, and not be too quick to think that he is<br />\nnot being given a fair show, would live up<br />\nfaithfully to the scholastic requirements he<br />\nknows to be just and right, Johns Hopkins<br />\nwould not only have a successful team, and<br />\none to be proud of, but it would feel the<br />\nincrease of that kind of spirit which makes<br />\nJohns Hopkins known for its tenacity to<br />\nideals, which aim at a just proportion for<br />\nevery kind of university activity, and which<br />\ndemand an honest, earnest and strenuous<br />\nendeavor in every one of them.<br />\nRALPH V. D. MAGOFFIN.<br />\n<br />\nSTEVENS NEXT.<br />\nOur fellows will back up against a tough<br />\nproposition when they play Stevens next<br />\nSaturday, for the Hoboken team has certainly been playing great football up to the<br />\npresent time. It has already played five<br />\nhard games and in the last two contests its<br />\nform has been greatly improved. Although<br />\noutweighed by fifteen pounds it played the<br />\nstrong Union eleven to a standstill, Lehigh<br />\nwhich always has a strong eleven, was only<br />\nable to score one touchdown against the Stute<br />\nteam. In the third game, which was with<br />\nPrinceton, Stevens played so strongly that<br />\nthe Tigers scored only four touchdowns in<br />\n<br />\nlJJ Hopkins men have long been pleased with the<br />\nexcellence of the furnishings to be found in the<br />\nMen's Store at ::<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLEK 13K1ME5(3;<br />\n210-218 NORTH HOWARD ST.<br />\n<br />\n1=1111<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ntwo twenty-minute halves. The contest with<br />\nthe New York University, Stevens won<br />\nhandily 6 to 5.<br />\nThe team is fast and well drilled and has<br />\nbeen working the onside kick and forward<br />\npass with great success. It possesses two<br />\ngood punters in Fonda and Ackerman. The<br />\nlatter seldom fails to boot the ball for less than<br />\n60 or 70 yards. Pettibone is fast at left half<br />\nand scored their only touchdown in the New<br />\nYork game. The latest lineup of the team<br />\nis as follows:<br />\nLeft end\u2014Bruce.<br />\nLeft tackle\u2014Hearsey.<br />\nLeft guard\u2014White.<br />\nCenter-0'Conner.<br />\nRight guard\u2014Johnson.<br />\nRight tackle\u2014Hendricks, Captain.<br />\nRight end\u2014Myers.<br />\nQuarter\u2014Buttfield.<br />\nLeft half\u2014Pettibone.<br />\nRight half\u2014Ackerman.<br />\nFullback\u2014Fonda.<br />\nOur team will not have an easy task next<br />\nSaturday. It is therefore, the duty and<br />\nshould be the pleasure of every man in the<br />\nUniversity who can possibly get away to form<br />\npart of the cheering section which is to help<br />\nthe team.

Nearly all of the old<br />\nmen are back again, and have already started<br />\nto limber up in the cage.<br />\nThe Freshmen Class is especially rich in<br />\nathletic material, and will undoubtedly<br />\nstrengthen the team considerably. One of<br />\nour weak spots last year, the broad jump, will<br />\nbe capably filled by Martin, who did great<br />\nwork for the City College last year. He is<br />\nalso speedy in the hurdle and dash events.<br />\nCaptain Brenton will be missed, but as Fulton,<br />\nalso of the City College, has entered, he, with<br />\n\"Old Reliable\" Dutch Breyer, will make the<br />\ndistance men sweat blood to win.<br />\nThe dashes will be well taken care of, for<br />\nJimmy Hunter, one of the best men on the<br />\n1906 team, has come back to help out. He,<br />\nwith Captain Bailey, Stollenwerck and George<br />\nStewart, will certainly form a speedy quartet.<br />\nBridgman and Tappan, will be out again for<br />\nthe hurdles; Maynard, Burgan and Tappan<br />\nfor the high jump; and Stewart and Deming in<br />\nthe broad. Bridgman will, as usual, take care<br />\nof the pole-vault. All of the old men in the<br />\nweights\u2014Magoffin, Miller and Bryant\u2014will<br />\nbe back.<br />\nThe schedule of games has not been arranged as yet, but we will have dual meets<br />\nwith Virginia, the Navy, Dickinson, Haverford and, perhaps, Swarthmore. Besides the<br />\ndual meets, there will be two open meets\u2014<br />\none in the cage or armory and one at Homewood.<br />\nAbove all, we must have a winning relay<br />\nteam this year. If all the men who can run<br />\nwill come out and work, there is not a reason<br />\nin the world why we should not have a winner. All of the places are open, and everybody will be given a fair chance. If you can<br />\nrun, or even if you think you might be able to<br />\n<br />\n\f12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nrun, respond to the first call for practise, and<br />\ncome out and work. Let's have a team that<br />\nwill beat everything we run against this year.<br />\nLACROSSE 1909.<br />\nWe are going to have a championship<br />\nlacrosse team this year. That is almost an<br />\nundisputable fact, for last year we had a<br />\nchampionship team and this year we will have<br />\nall our old men except three\u2014Walter Blanck,<br />\nCharlie Myers and Ralph Williams.<br />\nFrom this fact, however, it does not result<br />\nthat the squad should be small this year. We<br />\nwant a big lacrosse squad this year, in fact<br />\nwe must have it if we expect to uphold our<br />\nreputation in the next few years to come. It<br />\nis true that there will be few places open on<br />\nthe team, but there will be an entirely different story in 1910, for then almost all of our<br />\npresent playing strength will have completed<br />\ntheir four years.<br />\nNow, everybody knows that first-class<br />\nlacrosse men are not developed in one year or<br />\neven two. The more the experience, the<br />\nbetter the player. This fact was conelusively<br />\nproved in the game with Toronto last season.<br />\nIn 1910 and 1911 the entire burden of putting<br />\nout a championship team will fall on the<br />\nshoulders of the present Freshmen and Sophomores.

We can add nothing here to what will be said in the<br />\n\u2022 daily journals about his life. None can better appreciate his greatness, however, than those who are connected with the institution<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\nwhose success is the crowning achievement of his life.<br />\n'Act<br />\nBut there is another, more personal side to the loss, which is<br />\nfelt by all who are members of the University. Very few of the<br />\npresent undergraduate body were personally acquainted with him,<br />\n\u2022 but we have the traditions of past years to shows us how much he<br />\nwill be mourned by hundreds of Hopkins men all over the world.<br /><br />\nNCE more the University has opened its doors to its students, and<br />\ncollege activities have begun with a vim. In this first issue of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER the Board of Editors takes the opportunity to welcome<br />\nall the old students back as well as the Freshmen. It is not necessary to give another account of the policy of the paper, for this was<br />\nprinted in one of the issues of last spring.<br />\nHowever, one change will be made, and that is to publish instead of a story in each number, an article written by one of the<br />\nfaculty on whatever subject the author may select. For the first of<br />\nthis series of leading articles we are greatly indebted to Dr. French,<br />\nwho has written thoughtfully upon a very vital question, in which the undergraduates<br />\nespecially will be interested.<br />\nWe expect to have many other articles which will be just as important and delightful<br />\nto read. These articles if nothing more should make the students take a renewed interest in<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER. We shall also have a new cover design for each issue. These designs<br />\nwill be the product of the students, and we shall be glad to receive for the approval of the<br />\nBoard original pictures from all who draw. These will make the paper as attractive on the<br />\noutside as it will be on the inside.<br /><br />\nv<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1,14. \u2022 .tisii2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nc\u2022z1464::.<br /><br />\nHE NEWS-LETTER is \"published by the undergraduate students of<br />\nJohns Hopkins University,\" and its editorial board is intended to be<br />\n4<br />\n\u20181<br />\n,-N<br />\n-1'<br />\ncomposed of representatives of each of the classes. Last year, howlb<br />\n12<br />\never, not one of the freshman class made the board. There were a<br />\n\u2022<br />\nfew competitors, but their work was not considered acceptable. This<br />\nleft that class without representation on the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nIt is hoped that the class of 1912 will show more interest in the<br />\n\u2022 -if::ZZ 2z:: \u2022<br />\nNEWS-LETTER.

What we want are short, snappy accounts of<br />\nclass doings, athletic notes, bright nonsense-rhymes and pen and ink sketches.

Makel to succeed Mr. Wright as Business Manager.<br /><br />\nA friend of the University has presented to it a collection of coins formed between 1850<br />\nand 1880 by the Marquis de Molius, a Spanish diplomatist, who served as Ambassador in<br />\nParis and London. After his death it passed into the hands of Don Antonio Vives, the wellknown collector and numismatist of Madrid, from whom it was recently purchased. The<br />\ncollection comprises more than 3,000 specimens, and includes coins of the Roman Republic,<br />\n(gold, silver and copper), of the Roman Emperors, (gold, 44, silver and copper), and 837<br />\ncoins of the Iberian and Roman-Spanish cities and colonies issued prior to the reign of Caligula.<br />\nIn this series of early Spanish coins lies the chief value of the collection, many of the known<br />\nissues represented being excessively rare, and several specimens in this collection being, so far<br />\nas is known, unique. Many years would be required to form another such Spanish collection,<br />\nand it would be most difficult to secure so many well-preserved specimens. The main interest<br />\nof this primitive Spanish coinage lies in the fact that it represents early Iberian art, and that it<br />\nfurnishes the best original material for the solution of the many problems connected with the<br />\nIberian language and Iberian epigraphy.<br />\nDon Antonio Vives, the last owner of the collection, by whom it was, to some extent,<br />\nenlarged, is author of the standard work on the coinage of the Spanish Moors, \"Monedas de<br />\nlas Dinastias Arabigo-Espanolas,\" Madrid, 1893. He formed the collection of Hispano_<br />\nMoorish coins now in the National Archological Museum at Madrid, which the Spanish<br />\nGovernment bought from him for 110,000 pesetas, and he owns the best private collection of<br />\nprimitive Iberian bronzes, to which reference is made in many publications on this subject.<br />\nThe following gifts have also been received recently for the department of Botany:<br />\nFrom the Park Commissioners of Baltimore, through Superintendent Manning, cuttings<br />\nof 50 species of exotic plants and 10 young plants; from Mrs. Augustus Hoen, of Baltimore, a<br />\nsplendid specimen of Cycas revoluta and a fine clump of Strelitzia regince; from Professor H. S.<br />\nCollard, of Iowa College, formerly a Johnston Scholar of the University, a 1,000-gram chemical<br />\nbalance.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nUPPER CLASSMEN AND LOWER.<br />\nBY JOHN C. FRENCH.<br /><br />\nBeing an upper-classman at Hopkins may,<br />\nperhaps, be regarded as a greater honor now<br />\nthan in former years. The present seniors,<br />\ntho themselves completing a three-year course,<br />\nare as a class the last who will do so. From<br />\nnow on seniors, being separated from freshmen by a greater interval, may justly demand<br />\nthe greater respect from them, and in the<br />\ntraditional enmity between sophomores and<br />\nfreshmen, never having been the rivals of<br />\neither, they may now hold an unembarrassed<br />\nneutrality. Advice to new students as to<br />\ntheir part in college life has never been<br />\nscanty; they get kindly, wholesome words<br />\nfrom the Dean at matriculation, exhortations<br />\nfrom the captains of teams and clubs at the<br />\nopening reception, and fatherly counsel in<br />\nprivate from their advisers. Of such official<br />\npatronizing they have perhaps enough. The<br />\ntime is opportune, however, to ask that upperclassmen shall take stock of their opportunities<br />\nand look their responsibilities in the face.<br />\nThose alumni who are concerned that<br />\nstudent life at Hopkins shall be enriched<br />\nwith worthy traditions\u2014and no others\u2014look<br />\nto the upper-classmen to inaugurate and maintain them. Tho speaking as one having no<br />\nauthority, I venture to say that both faculty<br />\nand alumni would give their moral support to<br />\na greater dominance over college customs by<br />\nseniors. Let me hazard a few suggestions as<br />\nto what they would have seniors do.<br />\nWithout question, the alumni would have<br />\nseniors put away childish things. Otherwise<br />\nthey can serve no useful purpose as arbiters of<br />\ncollege affairs. A certain regrettable incident<br />\nof last year's student frivolity was all the<br />\nmore regrettable because the disturbance\u2014itself without precedent or excuse\u2014was incited<br />\nand abetted by seniors.<br />\nAgain, they would have seniors free themselves from all manner of partiality. As between freshmen and sophomores, they must be<br />\ncapable of a judicial attitude. Students expect, and rightly, that such members of the<br />\nfaculty as belong to fraternities having chapters here shall not carry the least memory of<br />\ntheir affiliations into the class room. An<br />\nequal impartiality should be possible to seniors.<br />\nThe censor of college customs must wield a<br />\nspear that knows no brother.<br /><br />\nIf there is to be hazing\u2014and I beg leave to<br />\nevade altogether the question whether there<br />\nshould be\u2014we should welcome some guarantee<br />\nthat it wiil not be carried beyond the limits of<br />\ngood-natured buffoonery. Is it not possible<br />\nto establish a tradition that no hazing whatever shall go on without the presence of a<br />\nSenior whose veto would be instantly respected? A referee is thought necessary when<br />\nthe parties to a sport are evenly matched.<br />\nHow much more necessary when one of them<br />\nis overborne by numbers and is expected for<br />\nthe sake of future college spirit to carry away<br />\nno rancor in his heart! . I believe there has<br />\nbeen no brutal hazing at Johns Hopkins; yet<br />\nthere have been freshmen, disposed to take<br />\ntheir hazing impersonally and as a sort of<br />\ninitiation to Hopkins life, who have carried<br />\non in bitterness the conviction that in their<br />\ncase the limits of reasonable exaction had<br />\nbeen over-stepped. It is to prevent this, as<br />\nwell as the possibility, remote as it is here,<br />\nperhaps, of physical injury thru some sophomore's excessive zeal, that I would have no<br />\nhazing except under rigid senior control.<br />\nWhere there are several fraternities and<br />\nnone too many students, rivalry becomes<br />\nkeen and abuses are likely to creep in. It is<br />\nno secret that at Hopkins some regulation of<br />\ninter-fraternity competition is needed. To the<br />\nupper-classmen, again, we look for the inauguration of reforms. This may not be a matter<br />\nfor legislation by the senior class-meeting, but<br />\na senior pan-hellenic conference might reach<br />\nconclusions to which the weight of their influence would secure acquiescence in every<br />\nchapter house.<br />\nFraternities might then<br />\nretain their dignity in the opening weeks of<br />\nthe college year and might safely spare its the<br />\nevil of pledging in infancy.<br />\nOf course, the senior's responsibility in his<br />\nfraternity does not end with the freshman's<br />\ninitiation, and it is fair to say that many older<br />\nfraternity men exercise a wholesome influence<br />\nover the rest of the chapter. Yet I believe<br />\nthey could do much more. For example, in<br />\nat least one northern college it is no uncommon thing for a senior fraternity man to call<br />\nupon a freshman's adviser to ask about the<br />\nyoungster's standing. In this way a student<br />\nwhose head is in danger of being turned by<br />\nthe new-found whirl of college pleasures may<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nbe saved a mistake he would regret. I have<br />\nknown a fraternity man to make shipwreck of<br />\nhis college course in the first few months,<br />\nwhen it semted to me that a good blowing-up<br />\nin the chapter house might have done more<br />\nfor him than the admonitions of dean and<br />\nadviser together. I see no reason why the<br />\nseniors in a fraternity should not stand in loco<br />\nparentis even to a freshman who lives in Baltimore. They should see to it that he becomes<br />\nneither an over-conscientious grind nor an<br />\nunscrupulous loafer, that he does not thru<br />\ndiffidence or indolence fail of his rightful<br />\nplace in college affairs, and that he lacks no<br />\npraise or blame that a careful older brother<br />\nwould not withhold.<br />\nMany freshmen do not, for a variety of<br />\nreasons become members of a fraternity.<br />\nThey should not on that account be neglected.<br />\nI would have the Senior class president so far<br />\npresume upon his office as to see that no<br />\nfreshman, by reason ot poverty or lack of<br />\nfriends or for any cause except wilful indifference, should remain wholly out of the current of student activities. It follows that the<br />\nsenior president should be chosen with care.<br />\nObviously, he should be man of tried tact<br />\nwith scholarship spfficient to assure him some<br />\nleisure for his task.<br />\nIn conclusion, let me offer a specific suggestion. On account of the change to a<br />\nfour-year course, the class of 1910 will have<br />\nat graduation scarcely more than a dozen or<br />\nfifteen members. In that year why not let the<br />\nHullabaloo be issued jointly by 1910 and 1911<br />\nand thereafter by the Junior Class?<br />\nNo<br />\nHullabaloo comes off the press just when its<br />\neditors intend. The result is that the seniors<br />\nare burdened at the same time with their<br />\nfinal examinations, all the details of graduating exercises, and the business affairs of<br />\nan enterprise reaching nearly a thousand<br />\ndollars. Senior year should involve less<br />\nstress rather than more. It is the last opportunity before the engrossing specialization of<br />\nprofessional school or business for the following of culture courses, for some indulgence<br />\nof intellectual whim, and for such richer and<br />\nfuller college life as I think all alumni would<br />\nhave Hopkins seniors enjoy and bequeath to<br />\nsophomores and freshmen.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE CLASS RUSH.<br />\nThe official opening of the University was<br />\ncompleted on Thursday, October the eighth,<br />\nwhen there took place the sophomore-freshman ''Rush.\" The occasion was perhaps<br />\nmore in the nature of an afternoon tea than<br />\nin former years, as the ground was thickly<br />\nspread with tan-bark, this provision doing<br />\naway with much of the unpleasantness caused<br />\nby the filling of one's mouth with a superabundance of mother earth.<br />\nThe rush itself was quite a successful affair,<br />\nparticularly in the last two conflicts, when<br />\nthe contestants appeared more warmed to the<br />\nwork. The freshmen gathered at one end of<br />\nthe arena and after the sophomores had given<br />\na blood-curdling ''Hullabaloo,\" followed by a<br />\nshrill and defiant \"Gee-bee, Gee-haa\" from<br />\nthe freshmen, signal was given, the two bands<br />\nrushed towards one another, and soon were<br />\nmingled in confusion. The sight of struggling<br />\nwarriors, the waving arms and legs and the<br />\ncries of ''Rescue!\" 'Freshman!\" ''Sophie!\"<br />\nwere no less delightful to the handful of the<br />\nFaculty than to the older students who had<br />\nassembled as spectators at this feature of the<br />\nsocial activities of the University.<br />\nThe \"decision\" was given to the freshmen<br />\nby the votes of the Officials and, in our<br />\nopinion, was really deserved. Both sides are<br />\nto be commended for the entire lack of bad<br />\nfeeling, and the amount of ginger and energy<br />\nin the whole affair.<br />\nFinally, we wish to extend our sympathy<br />\nto a certain prominent professor of mathematics, who, by a miscalculation, arrived<br />\njust too late to view the conflict.<br /><br />\nWALTER AND HAPPY RETURN.<br />\nWalter Noir, manufacturer of the famous<br />\nHair Tonic, has returned to the University,<br />\ntogether with the no less popular \u2014 Happy.\"<br />\nNeither of these individuals appears to change<br />\nin the slightest from year to year and return<br />\nreadier than ever to polish up our chins or<br />\nshoes, as the case may be. The welcome to<br />\nthese two patriarchs of the University is so<br />\nuniVersal that it is scarcely necessary for us<br />\nto say that we rejoice at their coming.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE DEAL IN \"J. &amp; H.\"<br />\nWall Street has had many leaders, but no<br />\none-ever had it so completely under control as<br />\nSilas Bonds. No one has ever foretold so<br />\naccurately the actions of stocks, no one has<br />\never had so many blind followers, no one has<br />\never made so much money on the Exchange,<br />\nas Mr. Bonds. The reason for this can probably be found in the old adage \"Nothing<br />\nsucceeds like success,\" and everyone knows<br />\nthat he has had but one failure and that even<br />\nthis was not his fault. Several stories of why<br />\nthe deal fell through are going the rounds,<br />\nbut none are correct. Mr. Bonds is too<br />\npiqued and Harry Davis is too tickle to tell<br />\nthe story in a form that will hand it down to<br />\nthe brokers of future generations as it really<br />\nwas, and so I, who am in a position to know,<br />\nfeel that, as John Henry says, \"it's up<br />\ntome.\"<br />\nOne day last autumn, Mr. Bonds was at<br />\nhis big mahogany desk, figuring out a deal in<br />\n\"railways\" by which he hoped to cripple his<br />\nalready panic-wounded opponents so completely that he would have the floor to himself for some time. As he sat there, planning<br />\ncarefully each move in the big deal, the card<br />\nof his wife's sister was brought in. Mr.<br />\nI3onds does not like to receive women in his<br />\noffice, for he feels they have no business in<br />\n\"The Street,\" but this lady's husband had<br />\nonly recently died, naming him executor.<br />\nAccordingly, Mr. Bonds felt that he must<br />\nsee her. When she was ushered in he met<br />\nher in the formally gracious way he uses towards all women, for hard, sharp business<br />\nman that he is, he has not forgotten what the<br />\nold school taught and expected.<br />\n\"Oh! Silas,\" she said, gushingly, as is her<br />\nway, \"I'm so sorry to trouble you, but really<br />\nI must see you on most important business.<br />\nYou know poor Jack didn't leave nearly as<br />\nmuch as we thought he would and I've come<br />\nto ask if you can't tell me some stock I can<br />\nbuy and sell in a day or two for more, so I<br />\ncan buy more of those bonds you are going to<br />\nget for me.\"<br />\n\"My dear Alice,\" replied Mr. Bonds,<br />\nsmiling under his grey moustache and smoking<br />\nhard so that she would not see, \"nothing is<br />\nsure in stocks and while I can probably find<br />\nyou something compartively safe still I could<br /><br />\nnot guarantee that all your little fortune<br />\nmight not be wiped out.\"<br />\nThis frightened her and she said so, but he<br />\nhastened to reassure her by saying, \"There<br />\nis little chance of losing all, but it is possible<br />\nthat a small loss, which would mean a good<br />\ndeal to you, might however be suffered. I<br />\nwould advise you to risk, well say, only ten<br />\nthousand. I can buy you one hundred and<br />\nfifty shares of a security I have in mind,<br />\nusing, of course, a small margin. The stock<br />\nis now selling at 81 and I am expecting it<br />\nto go to 150. I am buying all I can get myself. Are you willing to risk it?\"<br />\nShe was willing and so that morning the<br />\nhouse of Bonds &amp; Company bought one hundred and fifty shares of Jerkwater and Huckleberry Railroad stock and entered it on the<br />\nbooks as the property of Mrs. Alice M.<br />\nFowler. Each morning after, that lady, before she even looked at the weather, the day's<br />\nbargains, or the society news, opened her<br />\nHerald at the financial page and looked for<br />\nthe cabalistic symbol `.J. &amp; H.,\" and each<br />\nmorning she found the figures opposite were<br />\nhigher than the day before.<br />\nSilas Bonds had planned a deal in that<br />\nstock and the deal was working successfully.<br />\nFirst, he picked up all the floating shares he<br />\ncould lay his hands on and then to inflate<br />\nits price, through his agents, his employees,<br />\nhis friends, his allies, and perhaps, too, by<br />\nthe aid of a little \"washing.\" Slowly the<br />\nprice rose, point by point, half point by half<br />\npoint, till by Christmas it reached 1480.<br />\nEverything was ripe for the culmination of<br />\nthe plan: a gradual unloading of the stock on<br />\nthe market. This must be carefully done, for,<br />\nin spite of the apparent demand, it would be<br />\na very easy thing to burst the bubble, since the<br />\nstock was quoting 'way above its true value.<br />\nNo one had discovered the scheme. True,<br />\nHogan &amp; Company held a big block, but their<br />\ngreed for the security would only catch them<br />\nthe surer in the slump that eventually was<br />\nsure to come.<br />\nThe day after Christmas, Mr. Bonds wrote<br />\nMrs. Fowler, telling her that \"J. &amp; H.,\" in<br />\nhis opinion, had reached the limit of its soar,<br />\nand asking her permission to sell her holdings.<br />\nThat very evening Mrs. Fowler was seated at<br />\ndinner next to a Mr. Henry Davis, who, so<br /><br />\nAMIN<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nw5\"<br /><br />\ntheir hostess said, was \"in Wall Street.\"<br />\nAccordingly, during a lull in the conversation,<br />\nthe good lady told her dinner companion that<br />\nshe was the proud possessor of one hundred<br />\nand fifty shares of \"J. &amp; H.\" Though \"shop<br />\ntalk\" is not good \"dinner talk,\" still Davis<br />\ncould not resist the temptation of asking if she<br />\nwould sell, as he was rather keen for J. &amp; H.\"<br />\n\"Oh! yes!\" cried Mrs. Fowler, pleased<br />\nthat this intelligent and apparently prosperous<br />\nyoung broker should take such a interest in<br />\nher dealing, and anxious to display her<br />\nknowledge of the market, \"I'll sell for Silas\u2014<br />\nI mean Mr. Silas Bonds, my brother-in-law.<br />\nHe wrote me this morning that the stock had<br />\ngone as high as he could put it, and that he<br />\nwas going to sell all he had.\"<br />\nNext morning \"J. &amp; H.\" broke with a<br />\ncrash that could be heard from the Battery<br />\nto Harlem. In ten minutes it dropped from<br />\n14972 down to 91.Tg. The intelligent and<br />\napparently prosperous young broker, who had<br />\nbeen Mrs. Fowler's confidant the evening before, was junior partner of Hogan &amp; Company, and they, seeing a chance to pinch their<br />\nrivals hard, dumped all their \"J. &amp; H.\" on<br />\nthe market.<br />\nThere's a postscript to the story which Mr.<br />\nBonds will not like me to tell, but it is surely<br />\npart of the history of the deal in \"J. &amp; H.<br />\nAfter the smoke of the first explosion settled<br />\na bit, he sat down and drew a personal cheque<br />\nfor twenty-two thousand four hundred and<br />\nfive dollars in Mrs. Fowler's favor and sent it<br />\nto her, saying he had bought her stock at<br />\nH.<br />\n14972 before the break.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nsongs. These were the excuses, \"I don't<br />\nknow the words,\" and 'I can't sing.\" Both<br />\nof these are absurd. The first is scarcely<br />\nlegitimate, as the songs are printed in the<br />\nHand-Book. The second is no excuse, for in<br />\na crowd of students there must certainly be<br />\none boy that can turn a tune, and if he starts,<br />\nthe rest will follow.<br />\nNow, when Hopkins has such good songs,<br />\nit certainly seems deplorable that they are not<br />\nused. Think of the encouragement to the<br />\nteams! The players hear their classmates<br />\nurging them and naturally brace up. It may<br />\nseem odd to some that cheering can help a<br />\nteam, but it is, nevertheless, true. Nearly<br />\neveryone has heard of the Princeton song,<br />\n\"Old Nassau,\" and of the wonderful effect<br />\nthe singing of this song has in arousing and<br />\nbracing up the teams. It is marvelous. The<br />\nHopkins songs can be made to have the same<br />\neffect, if only they are sung. Therefore, this<br />\nfall, at the football games, let all the students<br />\ngather together and sing that inspiring song,<br />\n\"Our Alma Mater in Dixie Land,\" the first<br />\nlines of which are:<br />\n\"Come, stand together, we'll raise a cheer,<br />\nand wave the Black and Blue;<br />\nWe pledge our faith as loyal sons, to Hopkins<br />\nwe'll be true.\"<br /><br />\nWHY NOT SING THE HOPKINS SONGS<br />\nTHIS YEAR?<br /><br />\nAttention! all you readers,<br />\nAnd make a careful note<br />\nOf how conceit has fallen;<br />\nVanquished by the goat\u2014<br />\nNow a Freshman may be bashful,<br />\nAnd afraid that he'll obtrude,<br />\nBut a Sophomore is a creature<br />\nWho usually is rude.<br /><br />\nLast year the rooting was unusually good.<br />\nUnder the inspiring leadership of Purdon<br />\nWright, the boys soon caught on to all the<br />\nyells and cheered lustily, with the same vigor<br />\nwhen Hopins was losing ground as when she<br />\nwas driving the opponents down the field.<br />\nThere was, however, one thing that they<br />\ndid not do, a thing that was greatly missed by<br />\nthose who had attended the games during<br />\nprevious years\u2014they did not sing the Hopkins<br /><br />\nTo him its second nature,<br />\nTo bully and annoy<br />\nAny shy and timid stranger<br />\nWho is just a little boy.<br />\nAnd so it is with pleasure<br />\nThat all devour the page<br />\nOf 1911's drubbing<br />\nBy the Freshmen in the cage.<br />\n\u2014V.

It has been said that the papers<br />\nmust keep their sporting .pages full, and that<br />\nthe baseball season is just over; it has been<br />\nclaimed that this is an age of athleticism run<br />\nwild; the real reason is, however, that school is<br />\nwork and athletics is play. It goes without<br />\nsaying that a more interesting and lively<br />\nnewspaper story can be written about the<br />\nnovelties of a college education than about its<br />\nrealities, for it really is true that students<br />\nseem to pick up a football with more avidity<br />\nthan they do books.<br />\nThere is, however, a just complaint that is<br />\nmade against too much newspaper talk about<br />\nthe college athlete. I have heard it granted<br />\nreadily that too much rushing into the public<br />\neye usually achieves notoriety for a college<br />\nprofessor, but that the more a college athlete<br />\ngets his picture and his doughty deeds in<br />\nthe paper, so much the more is his school<br />\nadvertised, and his own fame increased.<br />\nHere, to my notion, lies the fallacy, and I<br />\nneed only to cite the case of Ralph Rose to<br />\nmake my point. The more advertising a man<br />\ngets, the more likely he is to think too well of<br />\nhimself, and then he gets into trouble.<br />\nCollege athletics is a big topic and an absorbing one. About that there is no question.<br /><br />\nBut in the arguments about the autumn sport,<br />\nfootball, there are, now and then, things said<br />\non both sides that are a bit unfair. For<br />\ninstance, there is too much stress laid on the<br />\naccident side of football. Statistics show it to<br />\nbe well down in the list of sports, when the<br />\nproportion is shown of participants and accidents. I was much struck with the detailed<br />\nstatements which were given in a Pittsburg<br />\npaper four years ago. In a certain year, 1903<br />\nor 1904, there were more deaths in West<br />\nVirginia alone during the first week of the<br />\nhunting season than there had been in football in the whole of the United States in tell<br />\nyears. And in comparison with automobile,<br />\nsteamship and railroad accidents, football is,<br />\nas the boys say, \"A squeak in a whirlwind.\"<br />\nPerhaps it is because the death or injury of a<br />\nfine, strong, young man, just at the beginning<br />\nof his career, seems so much more unnecessary<br />\nthan the same thing in automobile or railroad<br />\naccidents.<br />\nAgain, the blame for accidents is often put<br />\nwhere it does not belong. I remember the<br />\nsorrow in a certain Western college at the<br />\ndeath of a young man on the football team,<br />\nand also the bitterness of his family against<br />\nfootball. It developed very soon that the<br />\nyoung man had been doing, no matter what,<br />\nbut several things that were contrary to the<br />\ntraining agreement under which the team had<br />\nvoluntarily promised to work. When the big<br />\nscrimmage came, the young fellow was there<br />\nwith all the will and pluck he had, but his<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nstrength was undermined, and he went down.<br />\nThat kind of a fellow might as well be killed<br />\none way as another. A man will pay for dishonesty in athletics as well as anywhere else.<br />\nFootball at Johns Hopkins seems to me to<br />\nbe on a very sane basis, and for that reason<br />\nso much the more solid. On the agreement<br />\nthat a student, who was not fit to represent<br />\nhis university in scholastic lines, was not fit<br />\nto represent it in athletics, practically all the<br />\nschools in this country have the eligibility<br />\nrule based on class standing. The good faith<br />\nof one school or another has been called in<br />\nquestion, now and then, but to the honor of<br />\nJohns Hopkins be it said, that such has not<br />\nbeen the case here. The rule is right, no one<br />\nquestions that. That it often works hardships on teams is certain. But I maintain<br />\nthat this need not be true so often. Student<br />\nsentiment should and could compel the exact<br />\ncompliance with both spirit and letter of the<br />\nlaw of training. But more, the class mates,<br />\nthe fraternity brothers, or intimate friends,<br />\nshould see to it that no man on any athletic<br />\nteam is allowed to do poor work in his studies.<br />\nWhatever that man needs, help, encouragement, criticism, scorn, boycott, to stir up his<br />\nenergies or arouse his sense of shame, that is<br />\nwhat he should get from the friends whom he,<br />\nas an athlete, is representing.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has reasons enough to feel<br />\nproud of its football team this year. There<br />\nis not as large a squad out as there should be,<br />\nbut there is a fine spirit in the men who are<br />\nthere. A good many of the necessary things<br />\nthat go to make up a successful season are<br />\nours. As good a field as any in the country,<br />\na splendid grand-stand of concrete, a nucleus<br />\nof old men in the team, a good coach and a<br />\ntried one, harmony between the men and the<br />\ncoach, a growing interest in the body of<br />\nalumni. Those are nearly enough to insure<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nOne thing more is absolutely necessary,<br />\nhowever, to make a football team. That is a<br />\nsecond team. It is the second team, the<br />\nscrubs, if you will, who are not good enough<br />\nto make the team this year, who may never be<br />\ngood enough to make it, so far as that goes,<br />\nthat makes the 'varsity team. I know men<br />\nwho have played on the second team for four<br />\nyears, and never made the \"Team,\" but they<br /><br />\nhelped make it, and they knew it, and so did<br />\neverybody else, and the deserved credit came<br />\ntheir way. No team which plays only its<br />\nregular weekly games can hope to make a fair<br />\nshowing against a team which has a daily<br />\ngame, for, of course, that few minutes or half<br />\nhour of daily tussle with a second team accustoms the men to the chances and exigencies<br />\nof intercollegiate games.<br />\nIf everybody who could get out and help,<br />\nwould do so, would take his knocks, would<br />\nput up with the difficulties the manager often<br />\nhas with clothes and shoes, would do his level<br />\nbest, and not be too quick to think that he is<br />\nnot being given a fair show, would live up<br />\nfaithfully to the scholastic requirements he<br />\nknows to be just and right, Johns Hopkins<br />\nwould not only have a successful team, and<br />\none to be proud of, but it would feel the<br />\nincrease of that kind of spirit which makes<br />\nJohns Hopkins known for its tenacity to<br />\nideals, which aim at a just proportion for<br />\nevery kind of university activity, and which<br />\ndemand an honest, earnest and strenuous<br />\nendeavor in every one of them.<br />\nRALPH V. D. MAGOFFIN.<br /><br />\nSTEVENS NEXT.<br />\nOur fellows will back up against a tough<br />\nproposition when they play Stevens next<br />\nSaturday, for the Hoboken team has certainly been playing great football up to the<br />\npresent time. It has already played five<br />\nhard games and in the last two contests its<br />\nform has been greatly improved. Although<br />\noutweighed by fifteen pounds it played the<br />\nstrong Union eleven to a standstill, Lehigh<br />\nwhich always has a strong eleven, was only<br />\nable to score one touchdown against the Stute<br />\nteam. In the third game, which was with<br />\nPrinceton, Stevens played so strongly that<br />\nthe Tigers scored only four touchdowns in<br /><br />\nlJJ Hopkins men have long been pleased with the<br />\nexcellence of the furnishings to be found in the<br />\nMen's Store at ::<br /><br />\nHUTZLEK 13K1ME5(3;<br />\n210-218 NORTH HOWARD ST.<br /><br />\n1=1111<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ntwo twenty-minute halves. The contest with<br />\nthe New York University, Stevens won<br />\nhandily 6 to 5.<br />\nThe team is fast and well drilled and has<br />\nbeen working the onside kick and forward<br />\npass with great success. It possesses two<br />\ngood punters in Fonda and Ackerman. The<br />\nlatter seldom fails to boot the ball for less than<br />\n60 or 70 yards. Pettibone is fast at left half<br />\nand scored their only touchdown in the New<br />\nYork game. The latest lineup of the team<br />\nis as follows:<br />\nLeft end\u2014Bruce.<br />\nLeft tackle\u2014Hearsey.<br />\nLeft guard\u2014White.<br />\nCenter-0'Conner.<br />\nRight guard\u2014Johnson.<br />\nRight tackle\u2014Hendricks, Captain.<br />\nRight end\u2014Myers.<br />\nQuarter\u2014Buttfield.<br />\nLeft half\u2014Pettibone.<br />\nRight half\u2014Ackerman.<br />\nFullback\u2014Fonda.<br />\nOur team will not have an easy task next<br />\nSaturday. It is therefore, the duty and<br />\nshould be the pleasure of every man in the<br />\nUniversity who can possibly get away to form<br />\npart of the cheering section which is to help<br />\nthe team.

Nearly all of the old<br />\nmen are back again, and have already started<br />\nto limber up in the cage.<br />\nThe Freshmen Class is especially rich in<br />\nathletic material, and will undoubtedly<br />\nstrengthen the team considerably. One of<br />\nour weak spots last year, the broad jump, will<br />\nbe capably filled by Martin, who did great<br />\nwork for the City College last year. He is<br />\nalso speedy in the hurdle and dash events.<br />\nCaptain Brenton will be missed, but as Fulton,<br />\nalso of the City College, has entered, he, with<br />\n\"Old Reliable\" Dutch Breyer, will make the<br />\ndistance men sweat blood to win.<br />\nThe dashes will be well taken care of, for<br />\nJimmy Hunter, one of the best men on the<br />\n1906 team, has come back to help out. He,<br />\nwith Captain Bailey, Stollenwerck and George<br />\nStewart, will certainly form a speedy quartet.<br />\nBridgman and Tappan, will be out again for<br />\nthe hurdles; Maynard, Burgan and Tappan<br />\nfor the high jump; and Stewart and Deming in<br />\nthe broad. Bridgman will, as usual, take care<br />\nof the pole-vault. All of the old men in the<br />\nweights\u2014Magoffin, Miller and Bryant\u2014will<br />\nbe back.<br />\nThe schedule of games has not been arranged as yet, but we will have dual meets<br />\nwith Virginia, the Navy, Dickinson, Haverford and, perhaps, Swarthmore. Besides the<br />\ndual meets, there will be two open meets\u2014<br />\none in the cage or armory and one at Homewood.<br />\nAbove all, we must have a winning relay<br />\nteam this year. If all the men who can run<br />\nwill come out and work, there is not a reason<br />\nin the world why we should not have a winner. All of the places are open, and everybody will be given a fair chance. If you can<br />\nrun, or even if you think you might be able to<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nrun, respond to the first call for practise, and<br />\ncome out and work. Let's have a team that<br />\nwill beat everything we run against this year.<br />\nLACROSSE 1909.<br />\nWe are going to have a championship<br />\nlacrosse team this year. That is almost an<br />\nundisputable fact, for last year we had a<br />\nchampionship team and this year we will have<br />\nall our old men except three\u2014Walter Blanck,<br />\nCharlie Myers and Ralph Williams.<br />\nFrom this fact, however, it does not result<br />\nthat the squad should be small this year. We<br />\nwant a big lacrosse squad this year, in fact<br />\nwe must have it if we expect to uphold our<br />\nreputation in the next few years to come. It<br />\nis true that there will be few places open on<br />\nthe team, but there will be an entirely different story in 1910, for then almost all of our<br />\npresent playing strength will have completed<br />\ntheir four years.<br />\nNow, everybody knows that first-class<br />\nlacrosse men are not developed in one year or<br />\neven two. The more the experience, the<br />\nbetter the player. This fact was conelusively<br />\nproved in the game with Toronto last season.<br />\nIn 1910 and 1911 the entire burden of putting<br />\nout a championship team will fall on the<br />\nshoulders of the present Freshmen and Sophomores. Therefore, it is more necessary than<br />\never before that a large squad come out and<br />\nget us their stickwork.<br />\nStickwork, however, is not the only thing<br />\nthat is necessary to develop a championship<br />\nsquad. Endurance is a most important factor,<br />\nand it is to develop this that the cross country<br />\nruns are being held twice every week. Look<br />\non the bulletin board and see when the next<br />\nis to be held and then go out and run.<br /><br />\nTHE RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS FOR 1910.<br />\nThe next Qualifying Examination for Scholars in the United States under the Rhodes<br />\nBequest will be held in October 1909; the<br />\nselection will be made before the end of<br />\nJanuary 1910, and the elected Scholars will<br />\nbegin residence at Oxford in October of the<br />\nsame year.<br />\nInquiries respecting the Scholarships for<br />\nMaryland may be addressed to President<br />\nRemsen, Johns Hopkins University, who is<br />\nchairman of the Committee for Maryland.<br /><br />\nDE NOBIS<br />\nThe year had gloomly begun<br />\nFor Willie Weeks, a poor man's<br /><br />\nSon.<br /><br />\nHe was beset by bill and dun<br />\nAnd he had very little<br /><br />\nMon.<br /><br />\n\"This cash,\" said he,\"wont pay my dues<br />\nI've nothing here but ones and<br />\nTues.<br />\nA bright thought struck him and he said<br />\nThe rich Miss Goldrich I will<br />\nWed.<br />\nBut when he paid his court to her<br />\nShe lisped, but firmly said, \"No<br /><br />\nThur.<br /><br />\n\"Alas!\"said he, \"then I must die.\"<br />\nHis soul went where they say souls<br /><br />\nFri.<br /><br />\nThey found his gloves and coat and hat<br />\nAnd the coroner then upon them<br /><br />\nSat.<br /><br />\n\u2014University Journal.<br /><br />\nHopkins Students!!!<br />\nSTYLE<br /><br />\nAND SERVICE<br /><br />\nARE<br /><br />\nWOVEN<br /><br />\nAND<br /><br />\nSTITCHED INTO EVERY<br /><br />\nARROW<br />\n15 CENTS EACH<br /><br />\nTWO FOR 25 CENTS<br /><br />\nCLUETT, PEABODY &amp; CO., MAKERS<br /><br />\nSTATIONERS<br />\n311 N.CHARLES ST<br />\n*<br />\n:\"11<br />\n.<br />\n.rrtiM0qE<br />\n;\"<br />\n:rd:Z<br />\n-;<br />\nTocaAviw<br /><br />\nSocial Etiquette with College<br />\nMen is an essential, therefore your<br />\nVisiting Cards and Stamped Stationery as well as your Gifts<br />\nshould be correct LYCETT, the<br />\nSociety Stationer, is at 317 N.<br />\nCharles Street, and can give you<br />\nall of these at reasonable prices.<br /><br />\nChocolates<br /><br />\nBonbons<br /><br />\n18 and 20 E.
