The Athletic Center, though still caught<br />\nin the throes of scheduling around bikinis and various types ofjock-e t tes, i.e., sauna hours that accommodate both the intermingling<br />\nand segregation of members of the bi-sexual undergraduate body,<br />\nand equal time in the weight room for coeds, has successfully attempted to attune its ear to adjusting to the invasion of women.<br />\nPutting these two developments in our back pocket to be used only as minor exceptions we must confront the reality of the coeducational situation at Hopkins which finds the undergraduate woman<br />\ncast in a definite category with respect to her male peers and professors.<br />\nIntellectually, the woman at Hopkins cannot realize a genuine persuit of knowledge without meeting stigmas inherently fostered in<br />\nany environment, particularly a former all-male one. While trying to<br />\noverlook the flagrant instances where professors have executed the<br />\npolicy of bestowing the highest academic honors to those students<br />\npossessing Pepsodent smiles and an equally appealing set of legs: or,<br />\non the other scale, professors adopting a hard-line attitude towards<br />\nthe same. It is not se easy to excuse the patronizing condescension<br />\nof male classmates, however. The latter have been known to practice<br />\nthe \"body but no brains\" philosophy when coping with an equally<br />\ncapable intellect housed in a female physique.<br />\nThose women who might be cited as having \"made it\" in a man's<br />\nworld, such as the Orientation and Fair chairpersons, on closer examination can be viewed as only holding positions of high social office.<br />\nPerhaps the relatively small percentage that the female population<br />\nconstitutes in the undergraduate body can be tagged as one reason<br />\nfor the underdeveloped intellectual and social relations between the<br />\nmale and female Hopkinsonian. But as long as the Admissions Office<br />\ncontinues to hold an increase in the number of females enrolled every year at bay, and the chauvinist attitudes of far too many males<br />\nat Homewood is allowed to continue, the vast intellectual capabilities of the Hopkins woman will remain to be untapped for some<br />\ntime to come, even as the years of coeducation march on.<br />\n<br />\n(Fletch wasn't exactly a source of<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nbeing<br />\nan<br />\nwhat<br />\nManipulation.

McERLEAN<br />\nThis being our last encuinter 'til<br />\nnext we meet, I should like to<br />\nimpart a summerful of my favorite<br />\nthoughts, all of which come under<br />\nthe heading of the Bozo Principle.<br />\nThe Bozo Principle (henceforth<br />\nalluded to as \"Bozo\" or \"the<br />\nPrinciple\"), remains as one of the<br />\nyet unrecognized human<br />\nuniversals. Its qualities are on the<br />\n<br />\nBozo rarely freezes, seldom sweats:<br />\non a frigid winter day he is able to<br />\nplace the sensation of a severe<br />\npolar snap inside a metal bottle, as<br />\nit were, and store it until summer<br />\nwhen \"miserable\" humidity<br />\npresides, and vice versa.<br />\nThe greatest challenge for a<br />\nBozo practicing Tenet I is the<br />\nmaximization of a disappointment.<br />\nI still haven't mastered this feat.<br />\n9.vom-cke<br />\n<br />\nOZO<br />\n<br />\nriiicip<br />\n<br />\ne.<br />\n<br />\nTenet I: Concerning the<br />\nMaximization ofOpportunity<br />\nIf I were asked to define Bozo in<br />\nfive words or less, my description<br />\nwould be identical to Tenet I. A<br />\n<br />\n4tv&<br />\nVt12L.<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nnot futile, i.e., one must learn to<br />\nthwart the idiosyncrasy of<br />\nsubjectivity.<br />\nThe crux, then, of Tenet I is<br />\nthat Bozo never loses: he is able to<br />\nprofit from whatever decision he<br />\nmakes. In the immortal words of<br />\nGeorge Washington Plunkett, \"I<br />\nseen my opportunities and I took<br />\n'ern.\" Plunkett was one of the<br />\nmore successful Bozo politicos..<br />\n<br />\n.t-%.Q way exs.t.s.<br />\n<br />\nsorrow into a period of a mere day<br />\n<br />\nWho never wanted to grow up, a<br />\n<br />\nor two, AND NO MORE!

I<br />\ncannot propose a universal<br />\nmechanism for achieving this end,<br />\nthough I can state some guidelines.<br />\nA.

The midway could never<br />\nhave been as successful as it was<br />\nwithout the conscientious efforts<br />\nof the members of the groups who<br />\nran the booths along it.<br />\nAn endeavor of this nature has<br />\nnever been attempted at a Hopkins<br />\nSpring Fair before, yet it proved<br />\ngratifying for the participants who<br />\nnetted monetary profits, the<br />\nthousands who attended and<br />\nenjoyed the midway, the Hopkins<br />\n<br />\ncommunity in general, as well as<br />\nthe members of the Spring Fair<br />\nBoard.<br />\nSpecial thanks go out to the<br />\nmembers of Sigma Pi Epsilon,<br />\nSigma Nu, Lazear House, Jewish<br />\nStudents Association, Pi Kappa<br />\nAlpha, Class of '77, Women's<br />\nCenter, Adams House, the Hopkins<br />\nBand, Barnstormers, Wolman Hall,<br />\nWilson-Wood House, Hullabaloo,<br />\nOutdoors Club, the Goucher Social<br />\nCommittee, Clark House, Baker<br />\nHouse, and the D.S.R.C. for doing<br />\ntheir part to make this year's<br />\n\"3400 On Stage\" an overwhelming<br />\nsuccess.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOn this campus, where concern<br />\nfor the student is somewhat<br />\nquestionable, there is one office<br />\ntha is set up for the student and<br />\nshows that it genuinely cares for<br />\nhim as a person. I am speaking of<br />\nthe Placement Bureau run by Mrs.<br />\nMarilyn Bugg and Mrs. Susan<br />\nDeutsch, two of the most<br />\nwonderful people you will ever<br />\nmeet. Both of them are very<br />\n<br />\nenthusiastic and interested in their<br />\njobs.<br />\nThe enthusiasm, friendliness,<br />\ninterests and concern that the<br />\nstudent encounters upon entering<br />\nthe office is very reassuring. They<br />\nhelp to make finding a job a much<br />\nless trying and traumatic<br />\nexperience for the student.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAlthough I commend the editors<br />\nand staff of the Course Guide for<br />\nproviding a much-needed service to<br />\nthe Hopkins undergraduates, I feel<br />\nI must take issue with their means<br />\nof evaluation and presentation of<br />\nmaterial. While some subjectivity is<br />\ninevitable in the formulation of a<br />\ncogent discussion from a variety of<br />\nopinions and statistical data, I<br />\nfound many of the presentations<br />\nvengeful, tactless, and hardly<br />\nworthy of publication.<br />\nThose who contributed to the<br />\nCourse Guide may legitimately<br />\nargue that some of its deficiencies<br />\nare due to the lack of supnort for<br />\n<br />\nthe publication from the student<br />\nbody. I personally did not have the<br />\ntime to work on it; I certainly<br />\nappreciate the dedication of the<br />\nfew die-hards who did. But the<br />\nproblem of staff is still not a<br />\nsufficient argument in explaining .<br />\nthe Course Guide's shoddy,<br />\namateuristic quality.<br />\nI cannot understand why, with<br />\nan equal amount of time and effort<br />\n\u2014 and perhaps a bit more of both a<br />\nsense of humor and good taste -the Course Guide could not<br />\nbecome a truly informative student<br />\naid. In its current state, it is not.<br />\n<br />\nAlan Fink<br />\n<br />\nTenet III: Correct Self \u2014 Love Is<br />\nthe Key<br />\nWe are all innately decent, not<br />\n'm assas perditiones' as St.<br />\nAugustine would like us to believe.<br />\nWhen a Bozo enjoys success, he<br />\nspends a miniumum amount of<br />\ntime patting himself on the back.<br />\nA certain amount of recognition of<br />\nself is absolutely vital, but too<br />\nmuch becomes perverted, leads to<br />\nnarcissism, and finally misanthropy<br />\n(See Tenet II. B). In his<br />\nmasterwork Peace of Mind, Dr.<br />\nJoshua Loth Liebman effectively<br />\noutlined aspects of one's obligation<br />\nto self by stating \"No person can<br />\nattain genuine self-respect until he<br />\nachieves the knowledge of the<br />\nconsistent and the inconsistent.\" I<br />\nbelieve he meant that as men we<br />\nshould realize the impact of our<br />\n<br />\nown lives upon the lives of others,<br />\nrealizes that we cannot love others<br />\nuntil we attain proper love of self.<br />\nBozo means the same. Life is too<br />\nshort to carry the burden of an<br />\ninferiority complex.<br />\nTenet IV. Self Acceptance<br />\nClosely related to Tenet III, the<br />\nTenet of Self-Acceptance includes<br />\nan essence so great that it warrants<br />\nseparate treatment. I am speaking<br />\n'Wl,gh?PPef.\u00a7 S?r):YOY`or;egs.<br />\n<br />\nequilibrium is extremely dynamic<br />\n<br />\nin nature and should in no way<br />\nconnote lassitude or lethargy. A<br />\nBozo is less susceptible to<br />\ndepression in this manner; if he<br />\ndoes sink, he reverts to Tenet I and<br />\nmaximizes the opportunity.<br />\nThere are many more tenets, to<br />\nbe sure. However, as I am severely<br />\nconstrained by the length of one<br />\npage, I shall now present a brief<br />\nhistory of the Bozo movement.<br />\nMy first taste of Bozo's<br />\npervasive influence came shortly<br />\nbefore Christmas, 1972. We were<br />\nin the midst of Fall term finals<br />\nstruggling to remain rationa and<br />\nlosing. Alison, Jay, Dwight, and<br />\nmyself chanced to dine together,<br />\nand before we knew it, all were<br />\nimbued in a stream of<br />\nconsciousness so deep none could<br />\nescape. When we had finished two<br />\nhours of convulsive conversation,<br />\neach of us knew that we had<br />\ntouched something bigger than all<br />\nof us combined: that essence was<br />\nBozo.<br />\nFrom then on the Principle<br />\nenjoyed quantized leaps in<br />\npopularity. As fervent disciples, we<br />\nsought to Bozo wherever it might<br />\nbe found. Bits of the entire<br />\nUniversity united in active<br />\nparticipation joined by Bozo<br />\nbonds.<br />\nI realized that Bozo could<br />\nassume gramthatical status as a<br />\nverb as well. \"Rebozo\" meant \"to<br />\nBozo again.\" The Firesign Theater<br />\nconjugated the infinitive of Bozo,<br />\n<br />\nGood times just as<br />\nfree as they were easy.<br />\n<br />\nNEWSiEfTER<br />\n<br />\nKen Goldman<br />\nBill Blubaugh<br />\n<br />\nJean Hochheimer<br />\n<br />\nweeknights later than the present<br />\ncurfew of 10:30 p.m.<br />\nOne gent even held forth on the<br />\nnotion that dormitory residents<br />\nshould be allowed to inflict infinite<br />\ndamage to the facilities since, as he<br />\nput it, 'my five thousand bucks<br />\nmust be paying for the dorms since \u2022<br />\nit obviously isn't paying for my<br />\neducation and I couldn't possibly<br />\ndo that much damage just fooling<br />\naround.'<br />\nInept graduate instructors come<br />\nin for frequent and merciless<br />\ncriticism from the undergraduates.<br />\nFrequently unprepared and usually<br />\ndisinterested, this raze breed of<br />\ngraduate student invariably<br />\ncontrives to spend fifty minutes<br />\ndisplaying his inability to express<br />\nhimself in clear and concise English<br />\nwhile grading exams and papers<br />\nwith a Draconian fervor.<br />\nYes, the gripes of the<br />\nHomewood undergraduate are<br />\nmany and varied, some legitimate,<br />\nothers not.

The total cash revenues<br />\nto Baltimore from the University<br />\ntherefore totaled nearly S5.5<br />\nmillion dollars.<br />\nThis latest report was<br />\nresearched and written by Dr.<br />\nKatharine Lyall and Roger<br />\nStough of the Hopkins Metro<br />\nCenter.<br />\nThe study which was<br />\nconducted between July 1 and<br />\nNovemberl of last year, applied<br />\nto the entire University, with all<br />\nuniversity personnel grouped<br />\ntogether. The only divisions of<br />\nthe University that were<br />\nexcluded were the Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab and the School of<br />\nInternational Studies located in<br />\n<br />\nSilver Spring and Washington.<br />\nD.C. respectively.<br />\nPrior to this publication only<br />\nshort reports written by smaller<br />\naffiliates of the University had<br />\nbeen done.<br />\nThe report was originally<br />\nconceived by Mrs. Kline of the<br />\nOffice of Community Affairs.\"<br />\nsaid Lyall. \"Our motivation for<br />\ndoing it was that we needed to<br />\nknow what the economic<br />\ninteractions were between the<br />\ncity and the University,\" she<br />\npointed out.<br />\nThere is a feeling shared by<br />\nsome on campus that Hopkins<br />\ndoes not involve itself with the<br />\ncity and is isolated. The study<br />\npoints out that this is not true.\"<br />\nThe study examined the<br />\neffects of the University from<br />\nthree different viewpoints: the<br />\nimpact on business in Baltimore,<br />\non the city government, and on<br />\nindividual citizens. Forty-five<br />\nmathematical models were used<br />\nto detennine the end results.<br />\n\"Because of the mathematical<br />\nmodels involved, the report can<br />\nbe revised each year. Only slight<br />\nLyaii.<br />\nadjustments have to be made to<br />\nmodify the method,\" added<br />\nBasically the results of the<br />\nreport came as no surprise to<br />\nmost Hopkins' officials. What<br />\nwas unusual, according to Lyall,<br />\nwas the extent of Hopkins'<br />\npersonnel living in the city itself.<br />\nThree-quarters of all University<br />\npersonnel live in Baltimore along<br />\nwith 67 percent of the hospital's<br />\ncustodial and secretarial staff and<br />\nabout 50 percent of its<br />\nprofessional staff. According to<br />\nthe report, \"one-third of<br />\nUniversity faculty and between a<br />\nhalf and two-thirds of other<br />\nUniversity and hospital personnel<br />\nrent housing in the cit ; the<br />\n<br />\nremainder own homes in the city<br />\nor own or rent housing outside<br />\nthe city.\"<br />\n\"Another interesting fact<br />\nbrought out by the report was<br />\nthe showing of Money that<br />\nBaltimore loses in property taxes<br />\neach year by the land held by the<br />\nUniversity that is not used for<br />\ncommercial uses.\" explained<br />\nLyall.<br />\n\"If that land was to be taxed<br />\nthan less than half of one-percent<br />\nof the total Baltimore property<br />\ntax sum would be raised. This<br />\nraises an excellent argument<br />\nagainst proponents of taxing<br />\nnon-profitable institutions.\"<br />\nThe University pays property<br />\ntaxes only on those lands that it<br />\nholds for commercial use.

Only<br />\nabout 42 units appear headed for<br />\nabolishment.<br />\n0 t her criteria for<br /><br />\ncontinuation of the program will<br />\nbe the institution's past record in<br />\nproducing officers, its<br />\nadministrative support of ROTC<br />\nprograms, its output of minority<br />\ngroup officers, and its<br />\ngeographical location.<br />\nFfilbert<br />\nOther armed service ROTC<br />\nprograms besides the Army are<br />\nalso facing similar programs.<br />\nCombined enrollment in the<br />\nArmy, Navy, and Air Force<br />\nROTC programs has dropped<br />\nfrom 161,000 in 1970 to a<br />\nprojected 61,000 in 1975.

The cost<br />\nper commissioned officer in a<br />\nunit producing more than 50<br />\ngraduates a year is $8,000. The<br />\ncost per officer for a unit<br />\nproducing less than 12 graduates<br />\nper year is $22,000.<br /><br />\nper year.

The Athletic Center, though still caught<br />\nin the throes of scheduling around bikinis and various types ofjock-e t tes, i.e., sauna hours that accommodate both the intermingling<br />\nand segregation of members of the bi-sexual undergraduate body,<br />\nand equal time in the weight room for coeds, has successfully attempted to attune its ear to adjusting to the invasion of women.<br />\nPutting these two developments in our back pocket to be used only as minor exceptions we must confront the reality of the coeducational situation at Hopkins which finds the undergraduate woman<br />\ncast in a definite category with respect to her male peers and professors.<br />\nIntellectually, the woman at Hopkins cannot realize a genuine persuit of knowledge without meeting stigmas inherently fostered in<br />\nany environment, particularly a former all-male one. While trying to<br />\noverlook the flagrant instances where professors have executed the<br />\npolicy of bestowing the highest academic honors to those students<br />\npossessing Pepsodent smiles and an equally appealing set of legs: or,<br />\non the other scale, professors adopting a hard-line attitude towards<br />\nthe same. It is not se easy to excuse the patronizing condescension<br />\nof male classmates, however. The latter have been known to practice<br />\nthe \"body but no brains\" philosophy when coping with an equally<br />\ncapable intellect housed in a female physique.<br />\nThose women who might be cited as having \"made it\" in a man's<br />\nworld, such as the Orientation and Fair chairpersons, on closer examination can be viewed as only holding positions of high social office.<br />\nPerhaps the relatively small percentage that the female population<br />\nconstitutes in the undergraduate body can be tagged as one reason<br />\nfor the underdeveloped intellectual and social relations between the<br />\nmale and female Hopkinsonian. But as long as the Admissions Office<br />\ncontinues to hold an increase in the number of females enrolled every year at bay, and the chauvinist attitudes of far too many males<br />\nat Homewood is allowed to continue, the vast intellectual capabilities of the Hopkins woman will remain to be untapped for some<br />\ntime to come, even as the years of coeducation march on.<br /><br />\n(Fletch wasn't exactly a source of<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nbeing<br />\nan<br />\nwhat<br />\nManipulation.

McERLEAN<br />\nThis being our last encuinter 'til<br />\nnext we meet, I should like to<br />\nimpart a summerful of my favorite<br />\nthoughts, all of which come under<br />\nthe heading of the Bozo Principle.<br />\nThe Bozo Principle (henceforth<br />\nalluded to as \"Bozo\" or \"the<br />\nPrinciple\"), remains as one of the<br />\nyet unrecognized human<br />\nuniversals. Its qualities are on the<br /><br />\nBozo rarely freezes, seldom sweats:<br />\non a frigid winter day he is able to<br />\nplace the sensation of a severe<br />\npolar snap inside a metal bottle, as<br />\nit were, and store it until summer<br />\nwhen \"miserable\" humidity<br />\npresides, and vice versa.<br />\nThe greatest challenge for a<br />\nBozo practicing Tenet I is the<br />\nmaximization of a disappointment.<br />\nI still haven't mastered this feat.<br />\n9.vom-cke<br /><br />\nOZO<br /><br />\nriiicip<br /><br />\ne.<br /><br />\nTenet I: Concerning the<br />\nMaximization ofOpportunity<br />\nIf I were asked to define Bozo in<br />\nfive words or less, my description<br />\nwould be identical to Tenet I.

The midway could never<br />\nhave been as successful as it was<br />\nwithout the conscientious efforts<br />\nof the members of the groups who<br />\nran the booths along it.<br />\nAn endeavor of this nature has<br />\nnever been attempted at a Hopkins<br />\nSpring Fair before, yet it proved<br />\ngratifying for the participants who<br />\nnetted monetary profits, the<br />\nthousands who attended and<br />\nenjoyed the midway, the Hopkins<br /><br />\ncommunity in general, as well as<br />\nthe members of the Spring Fair<br />\nBoard.<br />\nSpecial thanks go out to the<br />\nmembers of Sigma Pi Epsilon,<br />\nSigma Nu, Lazear House, Jewish<br />\nStudents Association, Pi Kappa<br />\nAlpha, Class of '77, Women's<br />\nCenter, Adams House, the Hopkins<br />\nBand, Barnstormers, Wolman Hall,<br />\nWilson-Wood House, Hullabaloo,<br />\nOutdoors Club, the Goucher Social<br />\nCommittee, Clark House, Baker<br />\nHouse, and the D.S.R.C. for doing<br />\ntheir part to make this year's<br />\n\"3400 On Stage\" an overwhelming<br />\nsuccess.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOn this campus, where concern<br />\nfor the student is somewhat<br />\nquestionable, there is one office<br />\ntha is set up for the student and<br />\nshows that it genuinely cares for<br />\nhim as a person. I am speaking of<br />\nthe Placement Bureau run by Mrs.<br />\nMarilyn Bugg and Mrs. Susan<br />\nDeutsch, two of the most<br />\nwonderful people you will ever<br />\nmeet. Both of them are very<br /><br />\nenthusiastic and interested in their<br />\njobs.<br />\nThe enthusiasm, friendliness,<br />\ninterests and concern that the<br />\nstudent encounters upon entering<br />\nthe office is very reassuring. They<br />\nhelp to make finding a job a much<br />\nless trying and traumatic<br />\nexperience for the student.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAlthough I commend the editors<br />\nand staff of the Course Guide for<br />\nproviding a much-needed service to<br />\nthe Hopkins undergraduates, I feel<br />\nI must take issue with their means<br />\nof evaluation and presentation of<br />\nmaterial. While some subjectivity is<br />\ninevitable in the formulation of a<br />\ncogent discussion from a variety of<br />\nopinions and statistical data, I<br />\nfound many of the presentations<br />\nvengeful, tactless, and hardly<br />\nworthy of publication.<br />\nThose who contributed to the<br />\nCourse Guide may legitimately<br />\nargue that some of its deficiencies<br />\nare due to the lack of supnort for<br /><br />\nthe publication from the student<br />\nbody. I personally did not have the<br />\ntime to work on it; I certainly<br />\nappreciate the dedication of the<br />\nfew die-hards who did. But the<br />\nproblem of staff is still not a<br />\nsufficient argument in explaining .<br />\nthe Course Guide's shoddy,<br />\namateuristic quality.<br />\nI cannot understand why, with<br />\nan equal amount of time and effort<br />\n\u2014 and perhaps a bit more of both a<br />\nsense of humor and good taste -the Course Guide could not<br />\nbecome a truly informative student<br />\naid.

B). In his<br />\nmasterwork Peace of Mind, Dr.<br />\nJoshua Loth Liebman effectively<br />\noutlined aspects of one's obligation<br />\nto self by stating \"No person can<br />\nattain genuine self-respect until he<br />\nachieves the knowledge of the<br />\nconsistent and the inconsistent.\" I<br />\nbelieve he meant that as men we<br />\nshould realize the impact of our<br /><br />\nown lives upon the lives of others,<br />\nrealizes that we cannot love others<br />\nuntil we attain proper love of self.<br />\nBozo means the same. Life is too<br />\nshort to carry the burden of an<br />\ninferiority complex.<br />\nTenet IV. Self Acceptance<br />\nClosely related to Tenet III, the<br />\nTenet of Self-Acceptance includes<br />\nan essence so great that it warrants<br />\nseparate treatment. I am speaking<br />\n'Wl,gh?PPef.\u00a7 S?r):YOY`or;egs.<br /><br />\nequilibrium is extremely dynamic<br /><br />\nin nature and should in no way<br />\nconnote lassitude or lethargy. A<br />\nBozo is less susceptible to<br />\ndepression in this manner; if he<br />\ndoes sink, he reverts to Tenet I and<br />\nmaximizes the opportunity.<br />\nThere are many more tenets, to<br />\nbe sure. However, as I am severely<br />\nconstrained by the length of one<br />\npage, I shall now present a brief<br />\nhistory of the Bozo movement.<br />\nMy first taste of Bozo's<br />\npervasive influence came shortly<br />\nbefore Christmas, 1972. We were<br />\nin the midst of Fall term finals<br />\nstruggling to remain rationa and<br />\nlosing. Alison, Jay, Dwight, and<br />\nmyself chanced to dine together,<br />\nand before we knew it, all were<br />\nimbued in a stream of<br />\nconsciousness so deep none could<br />\nescape. When we had finished two<br />\nhours of convulsive conversation,<br />\neach of us knew that we had<br />\ntouched something bigger than all<br />\nof us combined: that essence was<br />\nBozo.<br />\nFrom then on the Principle<br />\nenjoyed quantized leaps in<br />\npopularity. As fervent disciples, we<br />\nsought to Bozo wherever it might<br />\nbe found. Bits of the entire<br />\nUniversity united in active<br />\nparticipation joined by Bozo<br />\nbonds.<br />\nI realized that Bozo could<br />\nassume gramthatical status as a<br />\nverb as well. \"Rebozo\" meant \"to<br />\nBozo again.\" The Firesign Theater<br />\nconjugated the infinitive of Bozo,<br /><br />\nGood times just as<br />\nfree as they were easy.<br /><br />\nNEWSiEfTER<br /><br />\nKen Goldman<br />\nBill Blubaugh<br /><br />\nJean Hochheimer<br /><br />\nweeknights later than the present<br />\ncurfew of 10:30 p.m.<br />\nOne gent even held forth on the<br />\nnotion that dormitory residents<br />\nshould be allowed to inflict infinite<br />\ndamage to the facilities since, as he<br />\nput it, 'my five thousand bucks<br />\nmust be paying for the dorms since \u2022<br />\nit obviously isn't paying for my<br />\neducation and I couldn't possibly<br />\ndo that much damage just fooling<br />\naround.'<br />\nInept graduate instructors come<br />\nin for frequent and merciless<br />\ncriticism from the undergraduates.<br />\nFrequently unprepared and usually<br />\ndisinterested, this raze breed of<br />\ngraduate student invariably<br />\ncontrives to spend fifty minutes<br />\ndisplaying his inability to express<br />\nhimself in clear and concise English<br />\nwhile grading exams and papers<br />\nwith a Draconian fervor.<br />\nYes, the gripes of the<br />\nHomewood undergraduate are<br />\nmany and varied, some legitimate,<br />\nothers not.

Hopkins will face<br />\ntheir final opposition this<br />\nweekend in a doubleheader.<br />\nEd Chory started for the Jays<br />\nand was the losing pitcher. He<br />\nhurled six full innings allowing<br />\nfour runs, three of which were<br />\nearned, or nine hits. Chory<br />\nfanned two and walked three.<br />\nBill Evans came on in relief<br />\npitching two frames in which<br />\nDickinsqn added three more<br />\nruns, all of which were unearned.<br />\nThe Blue \u2014 Jays never<br />\nthreatened in the game. They<br />\npicked up their lone talley in the<br />\nfourth inning. Mike Bogdan<br />\nopened with a single and moved<br />\nto second on a wild pitch. After<br />\ntwo men were down, Tony<br />\nPucillos drove him home with a<br />\nbase hit. Bogdan and Pucillo were<br />\nthe only batsment to get hits for<br />\nthe Jays. Bogdan was 2-3 and<br />\nPucillo hit 2-4.<br />\nDickinson broke on top to<br />\nstay right in the first inning<br />\nscoring three runs. The Red<br />\nDevils picked up one more in the<br />\nsixth and three more in the<br /><br />\neighth, all runs coming on<br />\nHopkins fielding miscues. The<br />\nJays committed four errors in the<br />\ngame.<br />\nIn the offensive departments,<br />\ncatcher Jim Duffy is the team<br />\nleader in batting.

Although<br />\nthe playoff system has detracted<br />\nfrom the ultimate significance<br />\nsuch a snowdown used to have,<br />\nno one can deny the drama these<br />\ntwo lacrosse superpowers<br />\ngenerate when they meet.<br />\nCertainly, Hopkins has a score<br />\nto even with the Terrapins after<br />\nlast year's humiliating 17-4 fiasco<br />\nin College Park.

The total cash revenues<br />\nto Baltimore from the University<br />\ntherefore totaled nearly S5.5<br />\nmillion dollars.<br />\nThis latest report was<br />\nresearched and written by Dr.<br />\nKatharine Lyall and Roger<br />\nStough of the Hopkins Metro<br />\nCenter.<br />\nThe study which was<br />\nconducted between July 1 and<br />\nNovemberl of last year, applied<br />\nto the entire University, with all<br />\nuniversity personnel grouped<br />\ntogether. The only divisions of<br />\nthe University that were<br />\nexcluded were the Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab and the School of<br />\nInternational Studies located in<br /><br />\nSilver Spring and Washington.<br />\nD.C. respectively.<br />\nPrior to this publication only<br />\nshort reports written by smaller<br />\naffiliates of the University had<br />\nbeen done.<br />\nThe report was originally<br />\nconceived by Mrs. Kline of the<br />\nOffice of Community Affairs.\"<br />\nsaid Lyall. \"Our motivation for<br />\ndoing it was that we needed to<br />\nknow what the economic<br />\ninteractions were between the<br />\ncity and the University,\" she<br />\npointed out.<br />\nThere is a feeling shared by<br />\nsome on campus that Hopkins<br />\ndoes not involve itself with the<br />\ncity and is isolated. The study<br />\npoints out that this is not true.\"<br />\nThe study examined the<br />\neffects of the University from<br />\nthree different viewpoints: the<br />\nimpact on business in Baltimore,<br />\non the city government, and on<br />\nindividual citizens. Forty-five<br />\nmathematical models were used<br />\nto detennine the end results.<br />\n\"Because of the mathematical<br />\nmodels involved, the report can<br />\nbe revised each year. Only slight<br />\nLyaii.<br />\nadjustments have to be made to<br />\nmodify the method,\" added<br />\nBasically the results of the<br />\nreport came as no surprise to<br />\nmost Hopkins' officials. What<br />\nwas unusual, according to Lyall,<br />\nwas the extent of Hopkins'<br />\npersonnel living in the city itself.<br />\nThree-quarters of all University<br />\npersonnel live in Baltimore along<br />\nwith 67 percent of the hospital's<br />\ncustodial and secretarial staff and<br />\nabout 50 percent of its<br />\nprofessional staff. According to<br />\nthe report, \"one-third of<br />\nUniversity faculty and between a<br />\nhalf and two-thirds of other<br />\nUniversity and hospital personnel<br />\nrent housing in the cit ; the<br /><br />\nremainder own homes in the city<br />\nor own or rent housing outside<br />\nthe city.\"<br />\n\"Another interesting fact<br />\nbrought out by the report was<br />\nthe showing of Money that<br />\nBaltimore loses in property taxes<br />\neach year by the land held by the<br />\nUniversity that is not used for<br />\ncommercial uses.\" explained<br />\nLyall.<br />\n\"If that land was to be taxed<br />\nthan less than half of one-percent<br />\nof the total Baltimore property<br />\ntax sum would be raised. This<br />\nraises an excellent argument<br />\nagainst proponents of taxing<br />\nnon-profitable institutions.\"<br />\nThe University pays property<br />\ntaxes only on those lands that it<br />\nholds for commercial use. Most<br />\nof the University is considered<br />\nnon-profit, and therefore,<br />\ntax-exempt.<br />\n\"This report. however, was not<br />\nintended to just point out the<br />\nfinancial benefits which the<br />\nUniversity provides for<br />\nBaltimore. Many advantages are<br />\nsupplied to the University from<br />\nthe city, especially in the area of<br />\npublic services,\" stated Lyall.<br />\nAccording to the report, the<br />\ncity provides service for faculty,<br />\nstaff and students of the<br />\nHopkins' institutions valued at<br />\nclose to S20 million. About two<br />\nmillion dollars represents the cost<br />\nof providing public school<br />\neducation for the children of<br />\nHopkins personnel and students,<br />\nand the balance is attributed to<br />\nthe total expenditures for public<br />\nservices, for each member of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThus, a basic inequity can be<br />\nseen between the payments that<br />\nthe University gives to the city,<br />\nand the value of services that the<br />\ncity gives to the University.<br />\nAccording to the report, $5.5<br /><br />\nboth the University and the city<br />\nmillion is paid by the University<br />\nto the city, while nearly $20 information to let each know of<br />\nmillion of services is received by the interactions that are involved<br />\nthe University from the city. The between the two. Many of the<br />\nreport suggested, however, that affairs of the University deal<br />\nthis inequity \"is not very specifically and directly to the<br />\nsurprising...presumably the city, and both the city and the<br />\ntax-exempt status is a recognition University will find the report<br />\nthat such institutions contribute useful,\" she said.<br />\n\"For example, the University<br />\nunpaid services to the<br />\nhas been making deposits in a<br />\ncommunity in many ways.\"<br />\nIn. addition, the report Savings and Loan Bank that<br />\nconcluded that the 13,000 jobs grants mortgages for people who<br />\nwhich the University provides want to buy homes in the<br />\nmakes it one of the city's major Homewood community. This is<br />\nonly one example of the<br />\nemployers.<br />\ninteraction which exists between<br />\nAccording to Lyall, Hopkins is<br />\nthe city and the University.\"<br />\nnot the first University to do<br />\nDr. Lyall, who first came to<br />\nsuch a study. -Other institutions<br />\nHopkins in the fall of 197-2, is al<br />\nthat have done such reports<br />\ninclude Syracuse University, graduate from the MaxwellJ<br />\nSchools of Syracuse University<br />\nUniversity of Arizona, Colorado<br />\nand Cornell.
