THROUGH CHEMISTRY<br />\nWATCH \"CAVALCADE OF AMERICA<br />\n\"ON TELEVISION<br />\n<br />\nTraining has many facets in a big firm like Du Pont, Dress,<br />\nand a great deal of thought has been given to make it truly<br />\neffective. We look upon training as a very important factor<br />\nin a man's career. We think that the best way to train a college graduate is to give him a maximum of on-the-job responsibility in a minimum length of time. That's the general<br />\nguiding policy at Du Pont, Dress.<br />\nOf course, each department varies this general policy to<br />\nsu.it its special needs. A new man being trained for production supervision may first spend a year or so in laboratory<br />\nor plant development work. Or he may spend his training<br />\nperiod as a plant operator. Thus a man obtains firsthand<br />\nknowledge of his process, and establishes a bond of mutual<br />\nrespect with the men he'll be working with on his first major<br />\nassignment.<br />\nA young man interested in sales is often first assigned to a<br />\nplant or laboratory dealing with the products he will later<br />\nsell; or he may join a group of trainees to learn selling techniques right from the start.<br />\nAn engineer, chemist, or other technical graduate is usually chosen for a specific job within his major field of study.<br />\nSuch a man brings specialized knowledge and skill to his<br />\njob, and he is encouraged to put them to use promptly. But<br />\nat Du Pont his experiences on the job are supplemented<br />\nwith lectures, conferences and discussion groups. In a very<br />\nreal sense, new technical employees continue training in<br />\ntheir specialties after joining the Company.<br />\nTo sum it all up, Dress, Du Pont's training program is<br />\nindividualized to provide a new man with specific opportunities to learn from contacts with more expeenced men.<br />\nThe prime objective of Du Pont training is always kept<br />\nclearly, in mind\u2014,to develop men for future advancement<br />\nand effectiveness in the organization.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE SIX<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nStudents Of Many Departments.<br />\nForm Academic Freedom Group<br />\n<br />\n01)r 41p1ins ilqopkitts Nrius-IErttrr<br />\nFounded in 1897<br />\nPublished every Friday during regular<br />\nversity except during examinations and<br />\ngraduates of the University.

We look upon training as a very important factor<br />\nin a man's career. We think that the best way to train a college graduate is to give him a maximum of on-the-job responsibility in a minimum length of time. That's the general<br />\nguiding policy at Du Pont, Dress.<br />\nOf course, each department varies this general policy to<br />\nsu.it its special needs. A new man being trained for production supervision may first spend a year or so in laboratory<br />\nor plant development work. Or he may spend his training<br />\nperiod as a plant operator. Thus a man obtains firsthand<br />\nknowledge of his process, and establishes a bond of mutual<br />\nrespect with the men he'll be working with on his first major<br />\nassignment.<br />\nA young man interested in sales is often first assigned to a<br />\nplant or laboratory dealing with the products he will later<br />\nsell; or he may join a group of trainees to learn selling techniques right from the start.<br />\nAn engineer, chemist, or other technical graduate is usually chosen for a specific job within his major field of study.<br />\nSuch a man brings specialized knowledge and skill to his<br />\njob, and he is encouraged to put them to use promptly. But<br />\nat Du Pont his experiences on the job are supplemented<br />\nwith lectures, conferences and discussion groups. In a very<br />\nreal sense, new technical employees continue training in<br />\ntheir specialties after joining the Company.<br />\nTo sum it all up, Dress, Du Pont's training program is<br />\nindividualized to provide a new man with specific opportunities to learn from contacts with more expeenced men.<br />\nThe prime objective of Du Pont training is always kept<br />\nclearly, in mind\u2014,to develop men for future advancement<br />\nand effectiveness in the organization.<br /><br />\nPAGE SIX<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nStudents Of Many Departments.<br />\nForm Academic Freedom Group<br /><br />\n01)r 41p1ins ilqopkitts Nrius-IErttrr<br />\nFounded in 1897<br />\nPublished every Friday during regular<br />\nversity except during examinations and<br />\ngraduates of the University.
