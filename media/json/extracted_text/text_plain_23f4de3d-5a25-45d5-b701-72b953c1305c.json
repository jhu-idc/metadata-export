There is only one way to stop having nothing, and that's to<br />\ndemand your share, and tell the world to stop treating you the<br />\nway it has. When you tell the world you've had enough, you<br />\nmay begin to get someplace.\" - - from a high school composition by a black student.<br />\nIt has been a week since the shouting has died down and by now<br />\nyou are probably sick of hearing about the riots, sick of post-curfew<br />\nriot jokes,, sick of telling your relatives how \"I was there, when.<br />\nand sick of downtown sightseeing. Most of you probably wince or<br />\njump to change the radio station when you hear another eulogy for<br />\nMartin Luther King- - the wince being one of boredom, and not of<br />\npain. Undoubtedly, you're also tired of hearing about the draft,<br />\nVietnam and the cliches concerning our \"sick\" nation. You just<br />\ndon't want to listen anymore. Thoughts,instead, are of making it at<br />\nGoucher, getting stoned, counting days until your next vacation and<br />\nsimply \"getting back to normal.\"(I wonder what's coming over me,\"<br />\nsaid a white civil rights worker back in the early sixties, \"I used to<br />\nbe pretty calm about life. I knew what was going on;I alwaysread<br />\nthe papers and magazines. But I never let current events rub offon<br />\nme.. . I never became tense.\")<br />\nYou don't want to listen, you don't want to feel \"tense,\" but,<br />\nbuddy, you better think it over. Your society is coming apart at the<br />\nseams, and if it does, your free and easy ride is over. You had better<br />\nstart giving a damn because this country is in an ugly mood right<br />\nnow and you are responsible and you will share in the conseauences.<br />\nIn the wake of recent events, it is being said that we must learn<br />\nfrom the brutal murder of Martin Luther King and last week's wave<br />\nof riots, which appear to be only spring training for the summer season. This is a laudable sentiment, but unfortunately, it is the same<br />\nformula statement which is automatically spouted after each national<br />\ntragedy. But are you listening, or are you bored? Or do you just sit<br />\nthere in the smug knowledge that ofcourse we will learn our lesson.<br />\nThat's what we said when Kennedy was shot; we pledged that we<br />\nwould purge the sickness from our country, that we would wipe out<br />\nthe hatemongers, that we would move forward. Yet we haven't<br />\nmoved, the words were empty,and you iust sat there.<br />\nHowever, we can see how easy it is for you not to let the whole<br />\n\"mess\" bother you. You can turn on the television and watch smiling<br />\nbroads plug Coca Cola just as if nothing else is happening \"out there.\"<br />\nOr you can forget the sickness and disease while chugging down beer<br />\nat a party or hiding under your books while pretending that the<br />\nworld is bowing and scraping and saying \"At your service, sir.\" Of<br />\ncourse, all this might bore you for you've heard it so many times before and sure, and have your own life to live. So enjoy the secure and<br />\nprosperous life while you can, but do so in the knowledge that<br />\none day your block might be burning; one day, you may be on the<br />\nreceiving end of a sniper's bullet; one day, you may be standing out<br />\nin some godforsaken Vietnam - - and then you'll wonder how the<br />\nhell you got into such a fix.<br />\nOr, you can do what has to be done. Like the Negro who was<br />\nquoted - - the Negro who is your fellow countryman - - you can join<br />\nin the struggle to break this stranglehold of sickness. You can confront the unresponsive forces which rule this country. You can say,<br />\nlike that black student,\"I have had enough.\"<br />\n<br />\nTonkin Gull Revisited 1<br />\nBy The Hon. LESTER L. WOLFF<br />\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Congressman<br />\nWolff's resolution is now pending<br />\nbefore the House Foreign Affairs<br />\nCommittee. Chances are that the<br />\nresolution may not get to thefloor<br />\nof the House during this session of<br />\nCongress, as the Foreign Affairs<br />\nCommittee will be occupied in<br />\nexamining the Foreign Aid Appropriations Bill.<br />\nRecognizing the fluidity of the<br />\npresent situation, it is a precarious<br />\npractice to write about the American role in Vietnam. But, forsaking<br />\ncrystal ball gazing, and with an eye<br />\nto the long-range perspective, I am<br />\npleased to respond to the invitation of the editor of the News-Letter to write a brief article about<br />\nmy efforts to secure repeal of the<br />\nGulf of Tonkin Resolution.<br />\nWhen, in August, 1964, the<br />\nCongress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution there was an immediate need to demonstrate support<br />\nfor American servicemen in Southeast Asia. My opposition to this<br />\nResolution, then, does not stem<br />\nfrom disagreement with its purpose nor with the questions that<br />\nhave been raised about the condi-<br />\n<br />\ntions by which the support of the<br />\nCongress was secured.<br />\nThus it is important to note that<br />\nmy objection to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution is not a repudiation<br />\nof President Johnson nor a lack of<br />\nsupport for American servicemen.<br />\nI would rescind the out-dated<br />\nResolution because, by.passing it,<br />\nthe Congress abdicated its rightful<br />\nrole in the decision-making process.<br />\nThere should exist ample room for<br />\ncooperation between the executive<br />\nand legislative branches in the determination and execution of foreign policy. Yet the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution has rendered inoperative the sharing of responsibility and thus has left Congress<br />\nan impotent bystander while vital<br />\ndecisions are being reached.<br />\nIt is now almost four years since<br />\nthe Congress, with only two negative votes, passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Since that time,<br />\nthe military, political and social<br />\ncircumstances, both in Vietnam<br />\nand here at home, have changed<br />\nradically. Since that time, the demands on our resources have grown<br />\nand we have been confronted with<br />\na series of crises including domestic<br />\nunrest, a weakening dollar and disruption of the Atlantic Alliance.<br />\nCongressman Wolff is a Democrat Since that time, 141 new Members<br />\nfrom Long Island, New York<br />\nhave been elected to the Congress.<br />\n<br />\nAnd all that time, Congress has<br />\nfailed to exercise a significant role<br />\nbecause of the forfeiture of its<br />\nresponsibility implicit in the Gulf<br />\nof Tonkin Resolution.<br />\nBy rescinding the Resolution<br />\nthe Congress need not commit itself to a specific set of alternatives<br />\nto present policy. Rather, repeal<br />\nof the Resolution will make it<br />\nclear that Congress wants a national debate in the formulation of!<br />\nfuture policy, and further, Congress wants to play a major role ni<br />\nthe determination of that policy,<br />\nWhile, as I indicated at the outset, the situation regarding Viet.<br />\nnam is quite fluid, the current<br />\nbombing restrictions and the pos'<br />\nsibility of talks with the North<br />\nVietnamese do not preclude the<br />\nneed to rescind the Gulf of Tonkin<br />\nResolution. For regardless of the<br />\noutcome of the current events, it<br />\nwill be necessary for the United<br />\nStates to make very basic decisions<br />\nabout the conduct of the war and<br />\nthe conditions for our future<br />\ncourse in Vietnam.<br />\nIf the Congress, as the elected<br />\nvoice of the people, is to play itS<br />\nnecessary role in determining our<br />\ncourse in Vietnam; and if the Congress is to accept its full responsY<br />\nbility; the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution must be repealed.<br />\n<br />\nVeritas<br />\n<br />\numilityIsForAngels<br />\n<br />\nBy STEPHEN SHRIVER<br />\nLincoln Gordon, our president,<br />\nreceived the Order of the Southern<br />\nCross Tuesday from an \"old<br />\nfriend,\" Brazilian Ambassador<br />\nVasco Leitau Da Cunha.

Aside from the question<br />\nof how best to alleviate the selfperpetuation of ghetto-dwellers,<br />\nor of whether to do it at all, since<br />\nit will be expensive, the most important of these issues in my opinion has to do with the restraint<br />\nexercised in the use of force to<br />\ncurb the disturbances. The implementation of this policy could signal a turning-point in the history of<br />\ndealing with noxious behavior in<br />\nthis country.<br />\nGenerally, the criminal act itself is the first and only social contact between a victim and his violator. Consequently, the rhetoric<br />\napplied to violators is compounded<br />\nexclusively of terms that characterize just the misdeed and its immediate emotional context.

However, we have<br />\nsome well-documented evidence<br />\nthat this is not so. Last summer's<br />\nriot in Detroit is a good example.<br />\nFrom the start, Detroit police followed an unrestrained policy regarding firing at looters. In the<br />\nfirst night, six persons were shot<br />\nwhile looting. Seventeen looters in<br />\nall were shot dead in Detroit. Yet<br />\ndamage in that city was extensive,<br />\nand the peak disturbance ran from<br />\nearly Sunday morning to Thursday<br />\n- - longer than it did in Baltimore.<br />\nQuite aside from its apparent<br />\nlack of effect in ending the disturbance in Detroit, this policy took a<br />\nheavy toll among the innocent. In<br />\nthe first night, an innocent white<br />\nwas killed by a nervous National<br />\nGuardsman. On the second day,<br />\ntwo innocent women and two innocent small children, in three separate incidents, were seriously<br />\nwounded when police fired upon<br />\nlooters. For those who count only<br />\ntheir own, let me point out that<br />\none of those children was white.<br />\nThe second night in Detroit a<br />\nguard defending a store was killed<br />\nby police firing at looters. A fireman was killed in another hail of<br />\nbullets directed at a supposed<br />\nsource of sniping. Innocent men in<br />\na car were shot as they slowed<br />\ndown to be checked at a roadblock. One of them died. A National Guard sergeant died under the<br />\nbullets of his own men when they<br />\nopened fire on a car. In all, 43<br />\npersons were killed in the Detroit<br />\nriot, most by police and National<br />\nGuardsmen. Only 17 were looters.<br />\nThe wounded were numerious, guilty or innocent. The full account<br />\ncan be read in the Report of the<br />\nNational Advisory Commission on<br />\nCivil Disorders.<br />\nIt must be realized that the<br />\nheedless, impulsive behavior, however triggered, that leads people to<br />\nlooting, and to arson in cases where<br />\nthe fire spreads, as it did in Detroit, to destroy their own house in<br />\nthe same block,or to the homes of<br />\nother Negroes,as it has in all cities,<br />\nis not easily deterred by a low probability of being shot and killed.<br />\nSaturating the city with troops<br />\ndoes end the disturbance, by increasing the probability of arrest.<br />\n<br />\nIn Baltimore, over 5,000 people<br />\nwere arrested. In this way, innocent deaths were avoided, and an<br />\nexample of respect for life and for<br />\nNegroes was set that this country<br />\nneeds badly. Looters were also<br />\nsaved from their own foolhardiness, so that today they are alive<br />\nto continue serving as mothers and<br />\nfathers, and as somebody's child.<br />\nBaltimore has been spared the consequences of the permanent bitterness that survivors harbor when relations, innocent or guilty, have<br />\nbeen callously slaughtered.<br />\nAt the present time, the policy<br />\nof restraint and those responsible<br />\nfor it are under attack from people<br />\nwith either no understanding of the<br />\nproblem or an interest in making<br />\npolitical capital out of it. Among<br />\ncritical politicians, comptrollerHyman Pressman has been the most<br />\noutspoken. One store-owner has<br />\ninstituted a suit for damages against<br />\nthe mayor and city council. Unfortunately, these people do not<br />\nrecognize that the cause of the<br />\nriot lies in conditions long preceding the assassination of Dr. King,<br />\nand that the damage could not be<br />\ncontained even by shooting more<br />\npeople. It is quite likely that a less<br />\nrestrained policy on shooting<br />\nwould have aggravated the disturbance. Judging from news reports,<br />\nthis may have been the case in<br />\nKansas City.<br />\nAnother symptom of the tendency to dwell obsessively on supposed immediate causes and policies is the almost pointless concern<br />\nwith the question of whether the<br />\nriots were organized, as though the<br />\nfact of organization itself was the<br />\ncrucial determinant. No amount of<br />\norganization can produce a riot in<br />\nthe absence of widespread disaffection, and wherever there is disaffection someone will always be available to encourage a violent reaction. Only the most severely repressive measures, such as prevail<br />\nwith some success in totalitarian<br />\nnations, could prevent this. Even<br />\nwhen it exists, whether such encouragement is to be construed as<br />\ncausing or contributing to the riot<br />\nin important measure is another<br />\nquestion. Does exhorting the Niagara River to flow contribute to<br />\nNiagara Falls? The focus on possible instigators seeks a more acceptable target for moral indignation,<br />\nand a cheaper solution. Unfortunately, exactly what constitutes<br />\n\"planning\" or \"instigation\" is never defined, so that any amount of<br />\nnascent neighborhood organization, boastful talk, or dire prediction is apt to be accepted as evi-<br />\n<br />\ndence for this diverting reconstruction of events. One can find examples of disorganization. Their actual activities usually bear little relation to these stories. Last winter,<br />\nthere was talk on Pennsylvania<br />\nAvenue of hijacking fuel trucks,<br />\npumping their contents into sewers, and setting it afire. Manifestly, this did not occur. Such talk<br />\nsimply reflects the grandiose fantasies of hostile people given that<br />\na riot was possibly in the offing.<br />\nFantasies of omnipotence are<br />\ncommon among angry and powerless persons, and they are as apt to<br />\ncrystallize around the supposed<br />\npower of the enemy as around the<br />\nsupposed power of friendly forces.<br />\nWhites who are inclined to attribute civil disorders to a conspiracy<br />\nexaggerate beyond all recognition<br />\nthe power of black militants. Let<br />\nthe same whites go up to Roland<br />\nPark or Guilford and try to whip<br />\nup enthusiasm for a riot, and they<br />\nmay gain some perspective. Once<br />\nspontaneous violence has broken<br />\nout, it can become necessary for<br />\nmilitants to claim to be in charge<br />\nin order for them to retain their<br />\npositions of leadership. Whether<br />\nthey actually have much effect on<br />\nthe course of events is another matter. These claims are apt to be retroactively embroidered,thus lending credence to any post-disturbance evidence of \"planning.\"<br />\nComptroller Pressman's conviction, despite abundant evidence to<br />\nthe contrary, that shooting people<br />\nwould have stopped the riot early<br />\nis another omnipotent fantasy. As<br />\nGeneral York pointed out, the<br />\npeople also shoot back. Of course,<br />\nif one allows for enough shooting,<br />\nor even bombing of the city, it<br />\ndoes become true that the riot<br />\ncould have been halted by force.<br />\nBut this is a trivial form of the argument, because hopefully no one<br />\nreally advocates this, and furthermore a riot could be stopped by<br />\nother means just as soon. Yet, this<br />\nmay be the vision lurking behind<br />\nthe faith in the efficacy of a<br />\n\"shoot-on-sight\" policy.<br />\nGovernor Agnew's self-righteous outburst at the moderate<br />\nNegro leaders also betrays a fantastic conception of their ability<br />\nto prevent a riot in the face of the<br />\nassassination of the one man who<br />\nmight have been able to do so. Last<br />\nsummer in Newark Negro moderates were actively present among<br />\nthe initial mobs, trying to disperse<br />\nthem and prevent violence. They<br />\nfailed completely. One Negro leader was stoned. In many cases, Negro moderates have lost their in-<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nfluence because of their failure to<br />\n.obtain concessions from white<br />\nleaders. In some cities they have<br />\nbeen arrested for loitering while<br />\nactively trying to pacify mobs.<br />\nRichard Berk, a graduate student<br />\nwho observed the near-confrontation between whites and Negroes<br />\nin the South Broadway area, reports that even the mothers of<br />\nwhite ten-year-olds were unable to<br />\nget their children off the street.<br />\nPerhaps Governor Agnew should<br />\nhave tried his own hand at this<br />\ngame. As it now stands, his moral<br />\nindignation has further undermined the authority of the very<br />\npeople whose help he needs.

This question has given rise to<br />\nmany lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings.<br />\nLet us today try to find an answer.<br />\nFirst, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is commonly called.) Keats' talent bloomed early. While still a<br />\nschoolboy at St. Swithin's he wrote his epic lines:<br />\nIf I am good I get an apple,<br />\nSo I don't whistle in the chapel.<br />\nFrom this distinguished beginning he went on to write<br />\nanother 40 million poems, an achievement all the more remarkable when you consider that he was only five feet<br />\ntall! I mention this fact only to show that physical problems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for<br />\nexample. was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all<br />\nwinter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature<br />\nnever stopped writing poetry for one day.<br />\nNor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil<br />\nwith the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping<br />\nNell Gwynne's pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became<br />\nknown as Guy Fawkes Day.) He left England to fight in<br />\nthe Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and<br />\n<br />\nwell, but women were never far from his mind, as evidenced by these immortal lines:<br />\nHow splendid it is to fight for the Greek,<br />\nBut I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to<br />\ncheek.<br />\nWhile Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in England, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of<br />\nGloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know<br />\nfrom his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no<br />\nmatter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge<br />\non the Duke's razor, and he was soon banished to<br />\nCoventry. (This later became known as The Industrial<br />\nRevolution.)<br />\nOne wonders how Shelley's life\u2014and the course of English poetry\u2014would have differed if Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For<br />\nPersonna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or<br />\nwhetting. It's sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays<br />\nthrough shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade<br />\nfit for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna,<br />\nthis jewel of the blade-maker's art, this boon to the cheek<br />\nand bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in doubleedge style and Injector style. Get some now during \"Be<br />\nKind to Your Kisser Week.\"<br />\nBut I digress. Byron, I say, was in Greece and Shelley<br />\nin England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to<br />\ngrow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric:<br />\nAlthough I am only five feet high,<br />\nSome day I will look in an elephant's eye.<br />\nBut Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,<br />\ntouched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This<br />\ntoo failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with<br />\nLucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley.<br />\nShelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife<br />\nMary and wrote his famous poem:<br />\nI love to stay home with the missus and write,<br />\nAnd hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.<br />\n<br />\nThe Purisf...<br />\nChoice of the Collegian<br />\nSero champions the traditional look on college<br />\ncampuses across the nation with its full-flared<br />\nPurist\u00ae button-down.

Keats tried to go too, but he was so small that the<br />\nclerk at the steamship office couldn't see him over the top<br />\nof the counter. So Keats remained in Rome and died of<br />\nshortness.<br />\nByron and Shelley cried a lot and then together composed this immortal epitaph:<br />\nGood old Keats, he might have been short,<br />\nBut he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.<br />\n* * *<br />\n01968, Max Shulman<br />\nTruth, not poetry, is the concern of Personna,and we<br />\ntell you truly that you'll not find a better shaving combination than Personna and Burma-Shave, regular or<br />\nmenthol.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, APRIL 19, 1968<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 12<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\n* NEWS<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nLETTER***<br />\n<br />\nStickers Crush Greyhounds;<br />\nSee Easy Victory Over Penn<br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br />\n<br />\ndent by spurting off to an 8-1 first club early-season woes, and the<br />\nquarter edge.

Most of you probably wince or<br />\njump to change the radio station when you hear another eulogy for<br />\nMartin Luther King- - the wince being one of boredom, and not of<br />\npain. Undoubtedly, you're also tired of hearing about the draft,<br />\nVietnam and the cliches concerning our \"sick\" nation. You just<br />\ndon't want to listen anymore. Thoughts,instead, are of making it at<br />\nGoucher, getting stoned, counting days until your next vacation and<br />\nsimply \"getting back to normal.\"(I wonder what's coming over me,\"<br />\nsaid a white civil rights worker back in the early sixties, \"I used to<br />\nbe pretty calm about life. I knew what was going on;I alwaysread<br />\nthe papers and magazines. But I never let current events rub offon<br />\nme.. . I never became tense.\")<br />\nYou don't want to listen, you don't want to feel \"tense,\" but,<br />\nbuddy, you better think it over. Your society is coming apart at the<br />\nseams, and if it does, your free and easy ride is over. You had better<br />\nstart giving a damn because this country is in an ugly mood right<br />\nnow and you are responsible and you will share in the conseauences.<br />\nIn the wake of recent events, it is being said that we must learn<br />\nfrom the brutal murder of Martin Luther King and last week's wave<br />\nof riots, which appear to be only spring training for the summer season. This is a laudable sentiment, but unfortunately, it is the same<br />\nformula statement which is automatically spouted after each national<br />\ntragedy. But are you listening, or are you bored? Or do you just sit<br />\nthere in the smug knowledge that ofcourse we will learn our lesson.<br />\nThat's what we said when Kennedy was shot; we pledged that we<br />\nwould purge the sickness from our country, that we would wipe out<br />\nthe hatemongers, that we would move forward. Yet we haven't<br />\nmoved, the words were empty,and you iust sat there.<br />\nHowever, we can see how easy it is for you not to let the whole<br />\n\"mess\" bother you. You can turn on the television and watch smiling<br />\nbroads plug Coca Cola just as if nothing else is happening \"out there.\"<br />\nOr you can forget the sickness and disease while chugging down beer<br />\nat a party or hiding under your books while pretending that the<br />\nworld is bowing and scraping and saying \"At your service, sir.\" Of<br />\ncourse, all this might bore you for you've heard it so many times before and sure, and have your own life to live. So enjoy the secure and<br />\nprosperous life while you can, but do so in the knowledge that<br />\none day your block might be burning; one day, you may be on the<br />\nreceiving end of a sniper's bullet; one day, you may be standing out<br />\nin some godforsaken Vietnam - - and then you'll wonder how the<br />\nhell you got into such a fix.<br />\nOr, you can do what has to be done. Like the Negro who was<br />\nquoted - - the Negro who is your fellow countryman - - you can join<br />\nin the struggle to break this stranglehold of sickness.

WOLFF<br />\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Congressman<br />\nWolff's resolution is now pending<br />\nbefore the House Foreign Affairs<br />\nCommittee. Chances are that the<br />\nresolution may not get to thefloor<br />\nof the House during this session of<br />\nCongress, as the Foreign Affairs<br />\nCommittee will be occupied in<br />\nexamining the Foreign Aid Appropriations Bill.<br />\nRecognizing the fluidity of the<br />\npresent situation, it is a precarious<br />\npractice to write about the American role in Vietnam. But, forsaking<br />\ncrystal ball gazing, and with an eye<br />\nto the long-range perspective, I am<br />\npleased to respond to the invitation of the editor of the News-Letter to write a brief article about<br />\nmy efforts to secure repeal of the<br />\nGulf of Tonkin Resolution.<br />\nWhen, in August, 1964, the<br />\nCongress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution there was an immediate need to demonstrate support<br />\nfor American servicemen in Southeast Asia. My opposition to this<br />\nResolution, then, does not stem<br />\nfrom disagreement with its purpose nor with the questions that<br />\nhave been raised about the condi-<br /><br />\ntions by which the support of the<br />\nCongress was secured.<br />\nThus it is important to note that<br />\nmy objection to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution is not a repudiation<br />\nof President Johnson nor a lack of<br />\nsupport for American servicemen.<br />\nI would rescind the out-dated<br />\nResolution because, by.passing it,<br />\nthe Congress abdicated its rightful<br />\nrole in the decision-making process.<br />\nThere should exist ample room for<br />\ncooperation between the executive<br />\nand legislative branches in the determination and execution of foreign policy. Yet the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution has rendered inoperative the sharing of responsibility and thus has left Congress<br />\nan impotent bystander while vital<br />\ndecisions are being reached.<br />\nIt is now almost four years since<br />\nthe Congress, with only two negative votes, passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Since that time,<br />\nthe military, political and social<br />\ncircumstances, both in Vietnam<br />\nand here at home, have changed<br />\nradically. Since that time, the demands on our resources have grown<br />\nand we have been confronted with<br />\na series of crises including domestic<br />\nunrest, a weakening dollar and disruption of the Atlantic Alliance.<br />\nCongressman Wolff is a Democrat Since that time, 141 new Members<br />\nfrom Long Island, New York<br />\nhave been elected to the Congress.<br /><br />\nAnd all that time, Congress has<br />\nfailed to exercise a significant role<br />\nbecause of the forfeiture of its<br />\nresponsibility implicit in the Gulf<br />\nof Tonkin Resolution.<br />\nBy rescinding the Resolution<br />\nthe Congress need not commit itself to a specific set of alternatives<br />\nto present policy. Rather, repeal<br />\nof the Resolution will make it<br />\nclear that Congress wants a national debate in the formulation of!<br />\nfuture policy, and further, Congress wants to play a major role ni<br />\nthe determination of that policy,<br />\nWhile, as I indicated at the outset, the situation regarding Viet.<br />\nnam is quite fluid, the current<br />\nbombing restrictions and the pos'<br />\nsibility of talks with the North<br />\nVietnamese do not preclude the<br />\nneed to rescind the Gulf of Tonkin<br />\nResolution. For regardless of the<br />\noutcome of the current events, it<br />\nwill be necessary for the United<br />\nStates to make very basic decisions<br />\nabout the conduct of the war and<br />\nthe conditions for our future<br />\ncourse in Vietnam.<br />\nIf the Congress, as the elected<br />\nvoice of the people, is to play itS<br />\nnecessary role in determining our<br />\ncourse in Vietnam; and if the Congress is to accept its full responsY<br />\nbility; the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution must be repealed.<br /><br />\nVeritas<br /><br />\numilityIsForAngels<br /><br />\nBy STEPHEN SHRIVER<br />\nLincoln Gordon, our president,<br />\nreceived the Order of the Southern<br />\nCross Tuesday from an \"old<br />\nfriend,\" Brazilian Ambassador<br />\nVasco Leitau Da Cunha.

ROBERT GORDON<br />\nProfessor ofSociology<br />\nJudging from the newspapers,<br />\nseveral issues concerning the recent<br />\ncivil disorders are now being hotly<br />\ndebated. Aside from the question<br />\nof how best to alleviate the selfperpetuation of ghetto-dwellers,<br />\nor of whether to do it at all, since<br />\nit will be expensive, the most important of these issues in my opinion has to do with the restraint<br />\nexercised in the use of force to<br />\ncurb the disturbances. The implementation of this policy could signal a turning-point in the history of<br />\ndealing with noxious behavior in<br />\nthis country.<br />\nGenerally, the criminal act itself is the first and only social contact between a victim and his violator. Consequently, the rhetoric<br />\napplied to violators is compounded<br />\nexclusively of terms that characterize just the misdeed and its immediate emotional context. The<br />\nviolator has no identity other than<br />\nthat conferred by the crime. Thus,<br />\nwe speak of \"rapists,\" \"looters,\"<br />\nand \"hoodlums\" and conjure up<br />\nimages of persons with no past or<br />\nfuture, without redeeming human<br />\nfeature or other social role, such<br />\nas parent or child, laborer or<br />\nfriend, animal lover or neurotic<br />\nfighting desperately against inner<br />\ndevils. What basis is there for advocating restraint toward the monstrosities spawned by this rhetoric<br />\nand frozen by it in the posture of<br />\ntheir most unattractive moments?<br />\nThis natural lack of incentive<br />\nto complicate one's conception of<br />\nthe violator, and consequently<br />\ncomplicate one's method of dealing<br />\nwith him,tends to be coupled with<br />\nnaive expectations concerning<br />\nwhat constitutes effective deterrence. Having defined a creature<br />\npossessing only noxious properties,<br />\nno reason exists for not applying<br />\nwhat are presumed to be the most<br />\neffective deterrents, even if these<br />\nhappen to be unspeakably harsh.<br />\nOnce apprehended, it is possible to<br />\npunish a violator as severely as one<br />\nlikes at little additional expense.<br />\nIn the case of looting,for example,<br />\nbullets are cheap, and the death of<br />\na dehumanized \"looter\", stripped<br />\nof his usual social identities by the<br />\nrhetoric of moral indignation, is<br />\nnot to be mourned.

However, we have<br />\nsome well-documented evidence<br />\nthat this is not so. Last summer's<br />\nriot in Detroit is a good example.<br />\nFrom the start, Detroit police followed an unrestrained policy regarding firing at looters. In the<br />\nfirst night, six persons were shot<br />\nwhile looting. Seventeen looters in<br />\nall were shot dead in Detroit. Yet<br />\ndamage in that city was extensive,<br />\nand the peak disturbance ran from<br />\nearly Sunday morning to Thursday<br />\n- - longer than it did in Baltimore.<br />\nQuite aside from its apparent<br />\nlack of effect in ending the disturbance in Detroit, this policy took a<br />\nheavy toll among the innocent. In<br />\nthe first night, an innocent white<br />\nwas killed by a nervous National<br />\nGuardsman. On the second day,<br />\ntwo innocent women and two innocent small children, in three separate incidents, were seriously<br />\nwounded when police fired upon<br />\nlooters. For those who count only<br />\ntheir own, let me point out that<br />\none of those children was white.<br />\nThe second night in Detroit a<br />\nguard defending a store was killed<br />\nby police firing at looters. A fireman was killed in another hail of<br />\nbullets directed at a supposed<br />\nsource of sniping. Innocent men in<br />\na car were shot as they slowed<br />\ndown to be checked at a roadblock. One of them died. A National Guard sergeant died under the<br />\nbullets of his own men when they<br />\nopened fire on a car. In all, 43<br />\npersons were killed in the Detroit<br />\nriot, most by police and National<br />\nGuardsmen. Only 17 were looters.<br />\nThe wounded were numerious, guilty or innocent. The full account<br />\ncan be read in the Report of the<br />\nNational Advisory Commission on<br />\nCivil Disorders.<br />\nIt must be realized that the<br />\nheedless, impulsive behavior, however triggered, that leads people to<br />\nlooting, and to arson in cases where<br />\nthe fire spreads, as it did in Detroit, to destroy their own house in<br />\nthe same block,or to the homes of<br />\nother Negroes,as it has in all cities,<br />\nis not easily deterred by a low probability of being shot and killed.<br />\nSaturating the city with troops<br />\ndoes end the disturbance, by increasing the probability of arrest.<br /><br />\nIn Baltimore, over 5,000 people<br />\nwere arrested. In this way, innocent deaths were avoided, and an<br />\nexample of respect for life and for<br />\nNegroes was set that this country<br />\nneeds badly. Looters were also<br />\nsaved from their own foolhardiness, so that today they are alive<br />\nto continue serving as mothers and<br />\nfathers, and as somebody's child.<br />\nBaltimore has been spared the consequences of the permanent bitterness that survivors harbor when relations, innocent or guilty, have<br />\nbeen callously slaughtered.<br />\nAt the present time, the policy<br />\nof restraint and those responsible<br />\nfor it are under attack from people<br />\nwith either no understanding of the<br />\nproblem or an interest in making<br />\npolitical capital out of it. Among<br />\ncritical politicians, comptrollerHyman Pressman has been the most<br />\noutspoken. One store-owner has<br />\ninstituted a suit for damages against<br />\nthe mayor and city council. Unfortunately, these people do not<br />\nrecognize that the cause of the<br />\nriot lies in conditions long preceding the assassination of Dr. King,<br />\nand that the damage could not be<br />\ncontained even by shooting more<br />\npeople. It is quite likely that a less<br />\nrestrained policy on shooting<br />\nwould have aggravated the disturbance. Judging from news reports,<br />\nthis may have been the case in<br />\nKansas City.<br />\nAnother symptom of the tendency to dwell obsessively on supposed immediate causes and policies is the almost pointless concern<br />\nwith the question of whether the<br />\nriots were organized, as though the<br />\nfact of organization itself was the<br />\ncrucial determinant. No amount of<br />\norganization can produce a riot in<br />\nthe absence of widespread disaffection, and wherever there is disaffection someone will always be available to encourage a violent reaction. Only the most severely repressive measures, such as prevail<br />\nwith some success in totalitarian<br />\nnations, could prevent this. Even<br />\nwhen it exists, whether such encouragement is to be construed as<br />\ncausing or contributing to the riot<br />\nin important measure is another<br />\nquestion. Does exhorting the Niagara River to flow contribute to<br />\nNiagara Falls? The focus on possible instigators seeks a more acceptable target for moral indignation,<br />\nand a cheaper solution. Unfortunately, exactly what constitutes<br />\n\"planning\" or \"instigation\" is never defined, so that any amount of<br />\nnascent neighborhood organization, boastful talk, or dire prediction is apt to be accepted as evi-<br /><br />\ndence for this diverting reconstruction of events. One can find examples of disorganization. Their actual activities usually bear little relation to these stories. Last winter,<br />\nthere was talk on Pennsylvania<br />\nAvenue of hijacking fuel trucks,<br />\npumping their contents into sewers, and setting it afire. Manifestly, this did not occur. Such talk<br />\nsimply reflects the grandiose fantasies of hostile people given that<br />\na riot was possibly in the offing.<br />\nFantasies of omnipotence are<br />\ncommon among angry and powerless persons, and they are as apt to<br />\ncrystallize around the supposed<br />\npower of the enemy as around the<br />\nsupposed power of friendly forces.<br />\nWhites who are inclined to attribute civil disorders to a conspiracy<br />\nexaggerate beyond all recognition<br />\nthe power of black militants. Let<br />\nthe same whites go up to Roland<br />\nPark or Guilford and try to whip<br />\nup enthusiasm for a riot, and they<br />\nmay gain some perspective. Once<br />\nspontaneous violence has broken<br />\nout, it can become necessary for<br />\nmilitants to claim to be in charge<br />\nin order for them to retain their<br />\npositions of leadership. Whether<br />\nthey actually have much effect on<br />\nthe course of events is another matter. These claims are apt to be retroactively embroidered,thus lending credence to any post-disturbance evidence of \"planning.\"<br />\nComptroller Pressman's conviction, despite abundant evidence to<br />\nthe contrary, that shooting people<br />\nwould have stopped the riot early<br />\nis another omnipotent fantasy. As<br />\nGeneral York pointed out, the<br />\npeople also shoot back. Of course,<br />\nif one allows for enough shooting,<br />\nor even bombing of the city, it<br />\ndoes become true that the riot<br />\ncould have been halted by force.<br />\nBut this is a trivial form of the argument, because hopefully no one<br />\nreally advocates this, and furthermore a riot could be stopped by<br />\nother means just as soon. Yet, this<br />\nmay be the vision lurking behind<br />\nthe faith in the efficacy of a<br />\n\"shoot-on-sight\" policy.<br />\nGovernor Agnew's self-righteous outburst at the moderate<br />\nNegro leaders also betrays a fantastic conception of their ability<br />\nto prevent a riot in the face of the<br />\nassassination of the one man who<br />\nmight have been able to do so. Last<br />\nsummer in Newark Negro moderates were actively present among<br />\nthe initial mobs, trying to disperse<br />\nthem and prevent violence. They<br />\nfailed completely. One Negro leader was stoned. In many cases, Negro moderates have lost their in-<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nfluence because of their failure to<br />\n.obtain concessions from white<br />\nleaders. In some cities they have<br />\nbeen arrested for loitering while<br />\nactively trying to pacify mobs.<br />\nRichard Berk, a graduate student<br />\nwho observed the near-confrontation between whites and Negroes<br />\nin the South Broadway area, reports that even the mothers of<br />\nwhite ten-year-olds were unable to<br />\nget their children off the street.<br />\nPerhaps Governor Agnew should<br />\nhave tried his own hand at this<br />\ngame. As it now stands, his moral<br />\nindignation has further undermined the authority of the very<br />\npeople whose help he needs. It has<br />\nalso provided a rallying point for<br />\nthose who think that social forces<br />\ncan be contained by self-righteous<br />\nrhetoric and admonitions. For a<br /><br />\nA A<br /><br />\nis extremely unwise, even though<br />\nthey dearly jeopardize life. (In<br />\nChicago, a Negro infant was burned<br />\nto death.) It amounts to summary<br />\nexecution based on snap judgment.<br />\nIt also requires shooting within the<br />\n-riot area under conditions where<br />\n.by-standers may be hit, and lowers.<br />\nthe threshold for police use of<br />\nfirearms in an otherwise tense situation, in that any dead Negro becomes an alleged arsonist.<br />\nIn addition to politicians, newspapers and clergymen have vested<br />\ninterests in the stereotyped thinking used in the rhetoric of moral<br />\nindignation, and thereby contribute to the tendency to solve<br />\ncomplicated problems by violent<br />\nmeans. This is true even when<br />\nsuch language is employed in a<br />\ngood cause.

This question has given rise to<br />\nmany lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings.<br />\nLet us today try to find an answer.<br />\nFirst, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is commonly called.) Keats' talent bloomed early. While still a<br />\nschoolboy at St. Swithin's he wrote his epic lines:<br />\nIf I am good I get an apple,<br />\nSo I don't whistle in the chapel.<br />\nFrom this distinguished beginning he went on to write<br />\nanother 40 million poems, an achievement all the more remarkable when you consider that he was only five feet<br />\ntall! I mention this fact only to show that physical problems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for<br />\nexample. was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all<br />\nwinter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature<br />\nnever stopped writing poetry for one day.<br />\nNor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil<br />\nwith the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping<br />\nNell Gwynne's pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became<br />\nknown as Guy Fawkes Day.) He left England to fight in<br />\nthe Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and<br /><br />\nwell, but women were never far from his mind, as evidenced by these immortal lines:<br />\nHow splendid it is to fight for the Greek,<br />\nBut I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to<br />\ncheek.<br />\nWhile Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in England, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of<br />\nGloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know<br />\nfrom his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no<br />\nmatter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge<br />\non the Duke's razor, and he was soon banished to<br />\nCoventry. (This later became known as The Industrial<br />\nRevolution.)<br />\nOne wonders how Shelley's life\u2014and the course of English poetry\u2014would have differed if Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For<br />\nPersonna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or<br />\nwhetting. It's sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays<br />\nthrough shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade<br />\nfit for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna,<br />\nthis jewel of the blade-maker's art, this boon to the cheek<br />\nand bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in doubleedge style and Injector style. Get some now during \"Be<br />\nKind to Your Kisser Week.\"<br />\nBut I digress. Byron, I say, was in Greece and Shelley<br />\nin England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to<br />\ngrow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric:<br />\nAlthough I am only five feet high,<br />\nSome day I will look in an elephant's eye.<br />\nBut Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,<br />\ntouched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This<br />\ntoo failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with<br />\nLucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley.<br />\nShelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife<br />\nMary and wrote his famous poem:<br />\nI love to stay home with the missus and write,<br />\nAnd hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.<br /><br />\nThe Purisf...<br />\nChoice of the Collegian<br />\nSero champions the traditional look on college<br />\ncampuses across the nation with its full-flared<br />\nPurist\u00ae button-down.

Keats tried to go too, but he was so small that the<br />\nclerk at the steamship office couldn't see him over the top<br />\nof the counter. So Keats remained in Rome and died of<br />\nshortness.<br />\nByron and Shelley cried a lot and then together composed this immortal epitaph:<br />\nGood old Keats, he might have been short,<br />\nBut he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.<br />\n* * *<br />\n01968, Max Shulman<br />\nTruth, not poetry, is the concern of Personna,and we<br />\ntell you truly that you'll not find a better shaving combination than Personna and Burma-Shave, regular or<br />\nmenthol.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, APRIL 19, 1968<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 12<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\n* NEWS<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nLETTER***<br /><br />\nStickers Crush Greyhounds;<br />\nSee Easy Victory Over Penn<br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br /><br />\ndent by spurting off to an 8-1 first club early-season woes, and the<br />\nquarter edge.
