After listing such topics as: \"Why a Misstep in a Girl is More Serious Than<br />\nin a Boy\"; \"The Female Sex Organs; Their Anatomy\"; \"Illegitimate Motherhood\"; \"The Girl Who<br />\nLost Her Virginity\"; \"Dainty Underwear\"; \"Simultaneous Loves<br />\nPossible ;\" \"Love in the Life of<br />\nPeople of High Culture\"; \"Conception and Abortion Radically<br />\nImpresDifferent\"; \"Maternal<br />\nsions\"; \"Syphilis\" and \"Venereal<br />\nProphy-Laxis\",\u2014after listing all of<br />\nthese, I say\u2014the author (the great<br />\nbut mysterious Dr. Robinson) finally comes to \"Promiscuous Kissing.\"<br />\nIn other words the chronological<br />\norder suggests that a young girl<br />\n(unprotected) who has done what<br />\nFreud suspects she would like to<br />\ndo, become a mother without a franchise granted by God, worn salacious underwear, loved two persons<br />\nsimultaneously and as a result of<br />\nher\u2014to be poetic\u2014indiscretions gotten the worst of things, has succeeded to such a state of ignominy<br />\nthat she now must be shielded from<br />\n\"Promiscous Kissing.\" Such a<br />\nmetaphysical conception of sin can<br />\nonly be rivalled by that of the Hopkins Student Council which having<br />\nbeen originally commissioned to prevent intellectual larceny on the Hopkins campus, exhausts all of its<br />\nenergies providing an audience for<br />\nincompetent assembly entertainers.<br />\n<br />\nOffice Manager<br />\nISADORE C.

Although the Student Council<br />\nruling that there will be no breaking up of banquets is still in effect,<br />\nit is probable that the members of the two classes will find other ways<br />\nto work out their pent up energy.<br />\nUnless the council takes some action, it is to be expected that a considerable amount of damage will be done during this period\u2014both to<br />\nproperty in vicinity of the University and to the class members themserves. When one starts out to completely eliminate the rah-rah' element from a college, it is necessary that no opportunity be given the<br />\nmen to exhibit their animal instincts.<br />\nTo give these individuals one such chance as this is much more dangerous than allowing some sort of hostilites throughout the entire college year. If freshman regulations and the interclass contests that go<br />\nwith them are to be abolished, it would be wise to abolish banquet<br />\nfights as well.<br />\nThere is no half way measure in this problem. It is necessary to definitely follow one course or the other. The present trend is, of course,<br />\nto remove all forms of class competition from the Homewood campus.<br />\nIf this be stingently enforced, it is probable that during the course<br />\nof years every trace of the 'motion picture' type of college will be removed. Whether or not this is the wish of the students, will be seen<br />\nwhen the result of the vote on freshman regulations is announced by<br />\nthe Student Council. It is needless to say that what the students wish is<br />\nnot always what is best for them. However, when there is a question<br />\nas to which course the authorities should follow, it would seem that<br />\nsome heed should be paid to the opinion of the majority of the student<br />\nbody.<br />\n<br />\nWHY THE DELAY?<br />\nit is very regretFROM the point of view of the athleticof authorities<br />\nPhysical Education has not<br />\n<br />\nable that the report of the committee<br />\nyet been submitted to Board of Trustees. With the general public under the impression that football has been abolished at Hopkins, it is<br />\nvitally necessary to the future of athletics that the decision be announced. Should the board decide to abolish football, it could not place<br />\nthe authorities in any more disagreeable position than they are in at the<br />\npresent writing. The question is one of such importance that a hasty decision should not be made, but in view of the necessity of some statement in the near future it would seem that greater effort could be exerted to bring the question before the board.<br />\n<br />\nlege. His name was Sweeney.<br />\nSweeney was an apollo. Or rather<br />\nhe was 95 per cent apollo for he had<br />\na cast in one eye. He was still,<br />\nhowever, an immensely romantic fellow. He was wont to strut up and<br />\ndown Charles Street\u2014always manipulating his neck so that the evileye shifted from the level of a second story window to the deep blue,<br />\nromanticS sky above. Thus you<br />\ncaught only a fleeting glimpse of the<br />\nevil-eye. He was still, however, an<br />\nimmensely romantic fellow.<br />\nBut how was such a romantic<br />\nperson to die? Was it to be at the<br />\nend of a rusty sword somewhere in<br />\nArabia? Was it to be under the<br />\nhoofs of a thundering herd in Arizona? Was it to be after a slammed<br />\ndoor, a tearing of flimsy pajamas<br />\nand a fall from a bouduoir of the<br />\nfiftieth story to the walks below?<br />\nNo. Sweeney got a sore throat<br />\nthree years ago this May. A physician came, and looked down<br />\nSweeney's throat. There was no<br />\ndoubt about it. Sweeney had tonsilitis. With the dawn of a fifth<br />\nday after, the romance, the evil-eye<br />\nand English instructor SWeeney<br />\nwere no more.<br />\nIV.<br />\nI take pride, perhaps, in exotic<br />\nthings. For instance, I am most<br />\nsupremely happy that I am the<br />\nonly Hopkins student who is convinced that the last Barnstormer<br />\nproduction was offensive even as<br />\nfourth-rate drama. I am profoundly conceited that I was the first<br />\nstudent to arrive at the conclusion<br />\nthat the Liberal Club is not liberal.<br />\nI am among the few, I believe,<br />\nwho feel that the average Hopkins<br />\nstudent is an ass. I am elated over<br />\nthe fact that it is my lot to believe<br />\nthat at least half of the faculty<br />\nare no better than the average student. I was the only Hopkins student, I venture to say, who rode<br />\ndown Charles Street on Easter Sunday in a suit three years old and a<br />\nheard that had a two-day start.<br />\nV.<br />\nWhatever may be the force that<br />\nmotivates an entering student to<br />\njoin a fraternity, it certainly cannot be one of friendship. I admit<br />\nthat I am hardly an authority on<br />\nwhat the personality books call the<br />\nArt Of Making Friends, but if<br />\nfriends are made by corraling a<br />\ngroup of freshmen into a house and<br />\nthen by selecting half for friends in<br />\na more or less haphazard fashion,<br />\nthen I hope I have an inexhaustible supply of enemies. Doubtless,<br />\nresidence in a fraternity house is<br />\npreferable to the primitive conditions of the dormitories, but when<br />\none considers that seventy-five per<br />\ncent of the people in the world<br />\naren't fit to live with anyway, I think<br />\na tent in Wyman's Park would have<br />\nits advantages.<br />\n<br />\nBOSTONIAN SHOES<br />\nTo the<br />\nmanner born<br />\ndo<br />\n<br />\nIf you naturally<br />\nchoose distinctive<br />\nfootwear, Fleetwing<br />\nneeds no praise from<br />\nus.

Although the Student Council<br />\nruling that there will be no breaking up of banquets is still in effect,<br />\nit is probable that the members of the two classes will find other ways<br />\nto work out their pent up energy.<br />\nUnless the council takes some action, it is to be expected that a considerable amount of damage will be done during this period\u2014both to<br />\nproperty in vicinity of the University and to the class members themserves. When one starts out to completely eliminate the rah-rah' element from a college, it is necessary that no opportunity be given the<br />\nmen to exhibit their animal instincts.<br />\nTo give these individuals one such chance as this is much more dangerous than allowing some sort of hostilites throughout the entire college year. If freshman regulations and the interclass contests that go<br />\nwith them are to be abolished, it would be wise to abolish banquet<br />\nfights as well.<br />\nThere is no half way measure in this problem. It is necessary to definitely follow one course or the other. The present trend is, of course,<br />\nto remove all forms of class competition from the Homewood campus.<br />\nIf this be stingently enforced, it is probable that during the course<br />\nof years every trace of the 'motion picture' type of college will be removed. Whether or not this is the wish of the students, will be seen<br />\nwhen the result of the vote on freshman regulations is announced by<br />\nthe Student Council. It is needless to say that what the students wish is<br />\nnot always what is best for them. However, when there is a question<br />\nas to which course the authorities should follow, it would seem that<br />\nsome heed should be paid to the opinion of the majority of the student<br />\nbody.<br /><br />\nWHY THE DELAY?<br />\nit is very regretFROM the point of view of the athleticof authorities<br />\nPhysical Education has not<br /><br />\nable that the report of the committee<br />\nyet been submitted to Board of Trustees.

Should the board decide to abolish football, it could not place<br />\nthe authorities in any more disagreeable position than they are in at the<br />\npresent writing. The question is one of such importance that a hasty decision should not be made, but in view of the necessity of some statement in the near future it would seem that greater effort could be exerted to bring the question before the board.<br /><br />\nlege.

For fear that even<br />\none person may have missed the<br />\nphilosophy that Mr. Schaal has been<br />\nunloading in the \"Y\" news for the<br />\npast year, there have been grouped<br />\nbelow a few of the outstanding tidbits.
