A vote of guilty by<br />\nfive members is required for conviction in all cases, Similarly, the<br />\npunishment to be imposed in cases<br />\nof a conviction must receive the approval of five members. All voting<br />\nis to be by open ballot.<br />\nStudents are urged by Charles<br />\nCrow, chairman of the Commission,<br />\nto remember that the successful<br />\noperation of the Honor system is dependent upon the cooperation of the<br />\nentire student body. The Commission wishes to stress the idea that<br />\na person witnessing a violation<br />\nshould Brat inform the guilty party<br />\nthat he has been seen violating the<br />\nHonor system. If the offender persists in his actions after this warning, he should be reported to the<br />\nHonor commission, Box 1000. The<br />\nCommission will give the alleged<br />\nviolator a fair trial. A first offender<br />\nis seldom expelled; however, in addition to whatever punishment is<br />\nmeted out, the student's name is<br />\nplaced on a 'black list' which was<br />\nstarted two years ago by the Student council.

A vote of guilty by<br />\nfive members is required for conviction in all cases, Similarly, the<br />\npunishment to be imposed in cases<br />\nof a conviction must receive the approval of five members. All voting<br />\nis to be by open ballot.<br />\nStudents are urged by Charles<br />\nCrow, chairman of the Commission,<br />\nto remember that the successful<br />\noperation of the Honor system is dependent upon the cooperation of the<br />\nentire student body. The Commission wishes to stress the idea that<br />\na person witnessing a violation<br />\nshould Brat inform the guilty party<br />\nthat he has been seen violating the<br />\nHonor system. If the offender persists in his actions after this warning, he should be reported to the<br />\nHonor commission, Box 1000. The<br />\nCommission will give the alleged<br />\nviolator a fair trial. A first offender<br />\nis seldom expelled; however, in addition to whatever punishment is<br />\nmeted out, the student's name is<br />\nplaced on a 'black list' which was<br />\nstarted two years ago by the Student council. Then, at a later date,<br />\nif the person is again convicted, and<br />\nhis name is already on the black<br /><br />\nlist, he will probably face expulsion.<br />\nIt is not the desire of the Honor<br />\ncommission to unduly punish students who are convicted the first<br />\ntime, but the aim is to expel those<br /><br />\nCha5Za VBeachley<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nHorace<br /><br />\nSie<br />\nwere elected president and<br />\nsecretary-treasurer, respectively, of<br />\nPi Delta Epsilon, honorary journal-<br /><br />\nwho are shown to be confirmed viOlatorS.<br /><br />\nistic fraternity, at a meeting last<br />\nWednesday.
