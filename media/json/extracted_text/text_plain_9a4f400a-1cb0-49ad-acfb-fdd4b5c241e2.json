He looked enviously untroubled and tranquil. From time<br />\nto time as we glanced up we noted that his head was moving in a<br />\nrhythmical sway but his face was still in the direction of the clock<br />\nso that we concluded that he was probably listening to the still sad<br />\nmusic of humanity, listening inwardly to the music of the spheres,<br />\nor perhaps composing verse of a nature so excruciatingly exotic<br />\nthat even the murmur in the library must have been a profanity.<br />\nA fellow student sauntered up behind the dreamer and unceremoniously clapped him on the back.

Then a<br />\nmost unpoetic line or so wandered across the space to us about<br />\nwhy in hell someone didn't stop that sort of thing!! A moment<br />\nor so later we caught his vagrant eye, and further completed the<br />\ndownfall of lofty thoughts by vulgarly winking at him, an unseemly act to be sure, but enacted in good faith. But even as he<br />\nreturned the wink we caught the gleam that betokens the writing<br />\nfever in his open eye. About fifteen minutes later he presented<br />\nus with the following as an answer to our plea in last issue of<br />\nYes and No. Whereupon he returned, slowly but with an even<br />\nmotion, to his chair and reveries.

At all times and places compliance with<br />\nthis code is expected; on the college grounds one is perfectly<br />\njustified in demanding it. This applies not only to the daily<br />\nroutine of classes and activities, but also to functions of any nature whatever which are given with the official sanction of the<br />\ncollege authorities, for at such affairs the University is largely<br />\njudged by the conduct of individuals. Sentiment at Hopkins has<br />\nalways favored gentlemanly, thoughtful conduct. It still does,<br />\nbut the action of a few individuals of late might lead to an incorrect impression.<br />\nTo be specific, we refer to drinking at the dances given in<br />\nthe Civil Engineering Hall by the Cotillon Board. In the first<br />\nplace, bringing liquor on the University grounds is absolutely<br />\nforbidden. From the point of view of general policy, and more<br />\nrecently of constitutionality, the wisdom and necessity of such a<br />\nruling is so apparent that there has never been any need of calling attention to it. We mentioned it here, however, to dispel<br />\nany possible misunderstanding. There are only a few rules laid<br />\ndown by the University authorities, but those few cannot be<br />\nbroken with impunity. This word to the wise should be sufficient.<br />\nFrom a strictly undergraduate point of view, the question is<br />\njust as serious. We hold no brief against drinking in itself; there<br />\nare occasions when it is permissible and perhaps even appropriate,<br />\nbut a Hopkins dance, especially on Hopkins grounds is not one<br />\nof them. This applies to what might be termed moderate drinking. Absolute drunkenness is difficult to condone under any circumstances; at a University dance it should not be tolerated for<br />\nan instant.<br />\nAt the recent dances given in the evening, especially at the<br />\none last Thursday, drinking was entirely too much in evidence.<br />\nNot all of the blame can be laid on members of the University,<br />\nsince some of the chief offenders were alumni or outsiders. The<br />\nfinal responsibility, however, rests with the Cotillon Board for<br />\nadmitting them. As a matter of fact, the board seems to be responsible for nearly all of the trouble. The small number of men<br />\nwho cause trouble by drinking at the dances could be easily controlled by the board, which is in charge; instead of taking any<br />\naction, some of its members go to the other extreme and themselves set a bad example.<br />\nIt seems to us that the inefficiency of the Cotillon Board has<br />\nbeen due merely to thoughtlessness and failure to realize its responsibility. Upon a little reflection, they should be able to handle<br />\nthe situation satisfactorily. If they are not, some more drastic<br />\nmeasures will have to be taken to make Hopkins dances worthy<br />\nof the best traditions of the University.<br />\n<br />\nOur First Contribution<br />\nSometimes I feel poetic. But it is difficult to write poetry,<br />\nwhich immediately sort of queers my fun in being poetic. And<br />\nanyway if one writes poetry one must be poetic about something,<br />\nlike a tree or someone's kisses or maybe a muse or so. However,<br />\nI do like to write but I always remember uncomfortably that someone said, I can't remember who, that someone else never wrote,<br />\nbecause primarily he had nothing to say and if he had he wouldn't<br />\nknow how to say it. Being less discreet, however, I plow ahead,<br />\nno purpose in view, somewhat like Dr. Mitchell's lecture, you<br />\nknow. Pardon me, sir! Do they ever ventilate the library?<br />\nCouldn't we advocate a male librarian or least a nice husky lady<br />\nwho might let in a bit of air intermittently?

He looked enviously untroubled and tranquil. From time<br />\nto time as we glanced up we noted that his head was moving in a<br />\nrhythmical sway but his face was still in the direction of the clock<br />\nso that we concluded that he was probably listening to the still sad<br />\nmusic of humanity, listening inwardly to the music of the spheres,<br />\nor perhaps composing verse of a nature so excruciatingly exotic<br />\nthat even the murmur in the library must have been a profanity.<br />\nA fellow student sauntered up behind the dreamer and unceremoniously clapped him on the back. The movement was extraordinary, that is on the part of the clapee. He moved rapidly and<br />\nprecipitately in a northerly direction, I mean he jumped. Then a<br />\nmost unpoetic line or so wandered across the space to us about<br />\nwhy in hell someone didn't stop that sort of thing!! A moment<br />\nor so later we caught his vagrant eye, and further completed the<br />\ndownfall of lofty thoughts by vulgarly winking at him, an unseemly act to be sure, but enacted in good faith. But even as he<br />\nreturned the wink we caught the gleam that betokens the writing<br />\nfever in his open eye. About fifteen minutes later he presented<br />\nus with the following as an answer to our plea in last issue of<br />\nYes and No. Whereupon he returned, slowly but with an even<br />\nmotion, to his chair and reveries.

At all times and places compliance with<br />\nthis code is expected; on the college grounds one is perfectly<br />\njustified in demanding it. This applies not only to the daily<br />\nroutine of classes and activities, but also to functions of any nature whatever which are given with the official sanction of the<br />\ncollege authorities, for at such affairs the University is largely<br />\njudged by the conduct of individuals. Sentiment at Hopkins has<br />\nalways favored gentlemanly, thoughtful conduct. It still does,<br />\nbut the action of a few individuals of late might lead to an incorrect impression.<br />\nTo be specific, we refer to drinking at the dances given in<br />\nthe Civil Engineering Hall by the Cotillon Board. In the first<br />\nplace, bringing liquor on the University grounds is absolutely<br />\nforbidden. From the point of view of general policy, and more<br />\nrecently of constitutionality, the wisdom and necessity of such a<br />\nruling is so apparent that there has never been any need of calling attention to it. We mentioned it here, however, to dispel<br />\nany possible misunderstanding. There are only a few rules laid<br />\ndown by the University authorities, but those few cannot be<br />\nbroken with impunity. This word to the wise should be sufficient.<br />\nFrom a strictly undergraduate point of view, the question is<br />\njust as serious. We hold no brief against drinking in itself; there<br />\nare occasions when it is permissible and perhaps even appropriate,<br />\nbut a Hopkins dance, especially on Hopkins grounds is not one<br />\nof them. This applies to what might be termed moderate drinking. Absolute drunkenness is difficult to condone under any circumstances; at a University dance it should not be tolerated for<br />\nan instant.<br />\nAt the recent dances given in the evening, especially at the<br />\none last Thursday, drinking was entirely too much in evidence.<br />\nNot all of the blame can be laid on members of the University,<br />\nsince some of the chief offenders were alumni or outsiders. The<br />\nfinal responsibility, however, rests with the Cotillon Board for<br />\nadmitting them. As a matter of fact, the board seems to be responsible for nearly all of the trouble. The small number of men<br />\nwho cause trouble by drinking at the dances could be easily controlled by the board, which is in charge; instead of taking any<br />\naction, some of its members go to the other extreme and them-<br />\n<br />\nOur First Contribution<br />\nSometimes I feel poetic. But it is difficult to write poetry,<br />\nwhich immediately sort of queers my fun in being poetic. And<br />\nanyway if one writes poetry one must be poetic about something,<br />\nlike a tree or someone's kisses or maybe a muse or so. However,<br />\nI do like to write but I always remember uncomfortably that someone said, I can't remember who, that someone else never wrote,<br />\nbecause primarily he had nothing to say and if he had he wouldn't<br />\nknow how to say it. Being less discreet, however, I plow ahead,<br />\nno purpose in view, somewhat like Dr. Mitchell's lecture, you<br />\nknow. Pardon me, sir! Do they ever ventilate the library?<br />\nCouldn't we advocate a male librarian or least a nice husky lady<br />\nwho might let in a bit of air intermittently? Dr. Boazz will have<br />\nto stop being so amusing. I had only three hours sleep last night<br />\nand I don't think I rested at all well in his class this morning.<br />\nBut Mr. Uhler has a splendid drone, and oh! how comfortable<br />\nthe seats in the rear of his classroom.

He looked enviously untroubled and tranquil. From time<br />\nto time as we glanced up we noted that his head was moving in a<br />\nrhythmical sway but his face was still in the direction of the clock<br />\nso that we concluded that he was probably listening to the still sad<br />\nmusic of humanity, listening inwardly to the music of the spheres,<br />\nor perhaps composing verse of a nature so excruciatingly exotic<br />\nthat even the murmur in the library must have been a profanity.<br />\nA fellow student sauntered up behind the dreamer and unceremoniously clapped him on the back.

Then a<br />\nmost unpoetic line or so wandered across the space to us about<br />\nwhy in hell someone didn't stop that sort of thing!! A moment<br />\nor so later we caught his vagrant eye, and further completed the<br />\ndownfall of lofty thoughts by vulgarly winking at him, an unseemly act to be sure, but enacted in good faith. But even as he<br />\nreturned the wink we caught the gleam that betokens the writing<br />\nfever in his open eye. About fifteen minutes later he presented<br />\nus with the following as an answer to our plea in last issue of<br />\nYes and No. Whereupon he returned, slowly but with an even<br />\nmotion, to his chair and reveries.

At all times and places compliance with<br />\nthis code is expected; on the college grounds one is perfectly<br />\njustified in demanding it. This applies not only to the daily<br />\nroutine of classes and activities, but also to functions of any nature whatever which are given with the official sanction of the<br />\ncollege authorities, for at such affairs the University is largely<br />\njudged by the conduct of individuals. Sentiment at Hopkins has<br />\nalways favored gentlemanly, thoughtful conduct. It still does,<br />\nbut the action of a few individuals of late might lead to an incorrect impression.<br />\nTo be specific, we refer to drinking at the dances given in<br />\nthe Civil Engineering Hall by the Cotillon Board. In the first<br />\nplace, bringing liquor on the University grounds is absolutely<br />\nforbidden. From the point of view of general policy, and more<br />\nrecently of constitutionality, the wisdom and necessity of such a<br />\nruling is so apparent that there has never been any need of calling attention to it. We mentioned it here, however, to dispel<br />\nany possible misunderstanding. There are only a few rules laid<br />\ndown by the University authorities, but those few cannot be<br />\nbroken with impunity. This word to the wise should be sufficient.<br />\nFrom a strictly undergraduate point of view, the question is<br />\njust as serious. We hold no brief against drinking in itself; there<br />\nare occasions when it is permissible and perhaps even appropriate,<br />\nbut a Hopkins dance, especially on Hopkins grounds is not one<br />\nof them. This applies to what might be termed moderate drinking. Absolute drunkenness is difficult to condone under any circumstances; at a University dance it should not be tolerated for<br />\nan instant.<br />\nAt the recent dances given in the evening, especially at the<br />\none last Thursday, drinking was entirely too much in evidence.<br />\nNot all of the blame can be laid on members of the University,<br />\nsince some of the chief offenders were alumni or outsiders. The<br />\nfinal responsibility, however, rests with the Cotillon Board for<br />\nadmitting them. As a matter of fact, the board seems to be responsible for nearly all of the trouble. The small number of men<br />\nwho cause trouble by drinking at the dances could be easily controlled by the board, which is in charge; instead of taking any<br />\naction, some of its members go to the other extreme and themselves set a bad example.<br />\nIt seems to us that the inefficiency of the Cotillon Board has<br />\nbeen due merely to thoughtlessness and failure to realize its responsibility. Upon a little reflection, they should be able to handle<br />\nthe situation satisfactorily. If they are not, some more drastic<br />\nmeasures will have to be taken to make Hopkins dances worthy<br />\nof the best traditions of the University.<br /><br />\nOur First Contribution<br />\nSometimes I feel poetic. But it is difficult to write poetry,<br />\nwhich immediately sort of queers my fun in being poetic. And<br />\nanyway if one writes poetry one must be poetic about something,<br />\nlike a tree or someone's kisses or maybe a muse or so. However,<br />\nI do like to write but I always remember uncomfortably that someone said, I can't remember who, that someone else never wrote,<br />\nbecause primarily he had nothing to say and if he had he wouldn't<br />\nknow how to say it. Being less discreet, however, I plow ahead,<br />\nno purpose in view, somewhat like Dr. Mitchell's lecture, you<br />\nknow. Pardon me, sir!

He looked enviously untroubled and tranquil. From time<br />\nto time as we glanced up we noted that his head was moving in a<br />\nrhythmical sway but his face was still in the direction of the clock<br />\nso that we concluded that he was probably listening to the still sad<br />\nmusic of humanity, listening inwardly to the music of the spheres,<br />\nor perhaps composing verse of a nature so excruciatingly exotic<br />\nthat even the murmur in the library must have been a profanity.<br />\nA fellow student sauntered up behind the dreamer and unceremoniously clapped him on the back. The movement was extraordinary, that is on the part of the clapee. He moved rapidly and<br />\nprecipitately in a northerly direction, I mean he jumped. Then a<br />\nmost unpoetic line or so wandered across the space to us about<br />\nwhy in hell someone didn't stop that sort of thing!! A moment<br />\nor so later we caught his vagrant eye, and further completed the<br />\ndownfall of lofty thoughts by vulgarly winking at him, an unseemly act to be sure, but enacted in good faith. But even as he<br />\nreturned the wink we caught the gleam that betokens the writing<br />\nfever in his open eye. About fifteen minutes later he presented<br />\nus with the following as an answer to our plea in last issue of<br />\nYes and No. Whereupon he returned, slowly but with an even<br />\nmotion, to his chair and reveries.

KRIEGER, '28<br /><br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br /><br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br /><br />\nA DISTURBING MINORITY<br />\nCollege men, taken as a whole, have a standard of conduct<br />\nhigher than the average. At all times and places compliance with<br />\nthis code is expected; on the college grounds one is perfectly<br />\njustified in demanding it. This applies not only to the daily<br />\nroutine of classes and activities, but also to functions of any nature whatever which are given with the official sanction of the<br />\ncollege authorities, for at such affairs the University is largely<br />\njudged by the conduct of individuals. Sentiment at Hopkins has<br />\nalways favored gentlemanly, thoughtful conduct. It still does,<br />\nbut the action of a few individuals of late might lead to an incorrect impression.<br />\nTo be specific, we refer to drinking at the dances given in<br />\nthe Civil Engineering Hall by the Cotillon Board. In the first<br />\nplace, bringing liquor on the University grounds is absolutely<br />\nforbidden. From the point of view of general policy, and more<br />\nrecently of constitutionality, the wisdom and necessity of such a<br />\nruling is so apparent that there has never been any need of calling attention to it. We mentioned it here, however, to dispel<br />\nany possible misunderstanding. There are only a few rules laid<br />\ndown by the University authorities, but those few cannot be<br />\nbroken with impunity. This word to the wise should be sufficient.<br />\nFrom a strictly undergraduate point of view, the question is<br />\njust as serious. We hold no brief against drinking in itself; there<br />\nare occasions when it is permissible and perhaps even appropriate,<br />\nbut a Hopkins dance, especially on Hopkins grounds is not one<br />\nof them. This applies to what might be termed moderate drinking. Absolute drunkenness is difficult to condone under any circumstances; at a University dance it should not be tolerated for<br />\nan instant.<br />\nAt the recent dances given in the evening, especially at the<br />\none last Thursday, drinking was entirely too much in evidence.<br />\nNot all of the blame can be laid on members of the University,<br />\nsince some of the chief offenders were alumni or outsiders. The<br />\nfinal responsibility, however, rests with the Cotillon Board for<br />\nadmitting them. As a matter of fact, the board seems to be responsible for nearly all of the trouble. The small number of men<br />\nwho cause trouble by drinking at the dances could be easily controlled by the board, which is in charge; instead of taking any<br />\naction, some of its members go to the other extreme and them-<br /><br />\nOur First Contribution<br />\nSometimes I feel poetic. But it is difficult to write poetry,<br />\nwhich immediately sort of queers my fun in being poetic. And<br />\nanyway if one writes poetry one must be poetic about something,<br />\nlike a tree or someone's kisses or maybe a muse or so. However,<br />\nI do like to write but I always remember uncomfortably that someone said, I can't remember who, that someone else never wrote,<br />\nbecause primarily he had nothing to say and if he had he wouldn't<br />\nknow how to say it. Being less discreet, however, I plow ahead,<br />\nno purpose in view, somewhat like Dr. Mitchell's lecture, you<br />\nknow. Pardon me, sir! Do they ever ventilate the library?<br />\nCouldn't we advocate a male librarian or least a nice husky lady<br />\nwho might let in a bit of air intermittently? Dr. Boazz will have<br />\nto stop being so amusing. I had only three hours sleep last night<br />\nand I don't think I rested at all well in his class this morning.<br />\nBut Mr. Uhler has a splendid drone, and oh! how comfortable<br />\nthe seats in the rear of his classroom.

Why don't these<br />\nco-eds wear longer dresses, who wants a telescope or didn't anyone<br />\nsay anything about one? Who writes \"Pourboire\" and why use<br />\nsuch a title as that? I don't know what it means, and that always<br />\ndisturbs me, why not call it \"Smatterings\" or \"Bits-o-Nothing\" or<br />\nanything delightfully inane like that. I'm always so disappointed<br />\nto start to read the column, not expecting to understand a word of<br />\nit\u2014and then find it so simple. Well I must sleep!<br />\nC. P.
