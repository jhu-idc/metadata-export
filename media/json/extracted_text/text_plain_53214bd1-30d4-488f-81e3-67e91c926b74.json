In large<br />\nlecture courses like Chemistry,<br />\nPhysics, Economics, and<br />\nAmerican Politics, the size of the<br />\nlecture hall and the funding<br />\navailable for T.A.'s are the major constraints on class size.<br />\nChemistry, Calculus, and<br />\nPhysics have two lecture periods,<br />\nso additional students are not a<br />\nspace problem.<br />\nProfessor Douglas Poland,<br />\nwho teaches one section of Introductory Chemistry, noted that<br />\n<br />\nhis expeCted enrollment was 250,<br />\nand 290 students enrolled.

In fact,<br />\nwriting-intensive courses already<br />\nexist throughout the schools of<br />\nArts and Sciences and Engineering, which, under the proposal,<br />\nwould be labeled 'W' in thc<br />\ncourse catalogue. The 'W'<br />\ndesignator would be in addition<br />\nto the current 'H,\"5,\"N \"Q,'<br />\nand 'E' area designators for<br />\ncourses. Two'W'courses would<br />\nbe required for a Bachelor of<br />\nScience degree and four for a<br />\nBachelor of Arts degree.<br />\nThese requirements, if approved, will not be put into effect immediately, but will be phased in<br />\ngradually, to give departments<br />\ntime to provide an adequate<br />\nnumber of courses. The proposal<br />\nrequires the class of 1993 to take<br />\none 'W'course, the class of 1994<br />\ntwo courses, B.A. students<br />\n<br />\ngraduating in 1995 three courses,<br />\nand B.A. students in the 1996<br />\nclass and thereafter four courses.<br />\nAccording to the proposal, the<br />\n'W'courses would not only teach<br />\na particular subject but would also<br />\npay close attention to students'<br />\nwriting skills through multiple<br />\nwriting assignments. Students<br />\nwould be asked to revise and<br />\nrewrite these assignments.<br />\nThe CUS proposed that a<br />\nWriting Committee be created to<br />\nassist the departments in planning their offerings and to help the<br />\nindividual teacher to incorporate<br />\nthe writing program into his or<br />\nher course.<br />\nAssociate Dean for Academic<br />\nAdvising Martha Roseman, who<br />\nchairs the CUS,elaborated on the<br />\n<br />\nreasons for the writing proposal:<br />\n\"A general feeling was brought<br />\nto the CUS that students don't<br />\nwrite well, and Practical Composition and C.A.L. were not<br />\nanswering the question. There's<br />\nmore to writing than grammar<br />\nand sentence structures. Critical<br />\nwriting shouldn't be a passive<br />\nlearning experience\u2014it should<br />\nhave more activity.<br />\nA member of the CUS<br />\nanswered the complaint, saying<br />\nthat \"in the long run the rewards<br />\nfor having a writing component<br />\nwill outweigh the work that all the<br />\nprofessors will get.\" Also speaking in defense of the proposal,<br />\nRoseman added, \"I advocate<br />\nanything that will make kids write<br />\nbetter.\"<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\n.

It was agreed by the Council that one of the events, either<br />\nthe fair or the testing, would have<br />\nto be changed to accomodate the<br />\nother. Several suggestions arose<br />\nas possible solutions, but were<br />\nsoon ruled out.<br />\nMoving the Spring Fair to the<br />\nprevious weekend would cause an<br />\nundue overload on campus<br />\nfacilities because of the coinciding events of Homecoming<br />\nand Open House for accepted<br />\nstudents. Student Council president Lou Giangiulio cited overcrowding and minimized parking<br />\nareas as reasons not to schedule<br />\nthe fair for this date. Holding the<br />\nfair the weekend before<br />\nHomecoming would place the<br />\nevent during the major religious<br />\nholidays of Easter and Passover.<br />\nGiangiulio suggested that the<br />\nweekend of April 5 seemed to be<br />\nthe last possibility. While council members mentioned that the<br />\nfair has been that early in<br />\nprevious years, general sentiment<br />\nwas that the fair would run into<br />\nweather with cold<br />\nbad<br />\ntemperatures and rain or possibly<br />\nsnow.<br />\nIt was then suggested that a<br />\nsolution might be to relocate the<br />\nMCATs off campus during the<br />\nSpring Fair, although a site has<br />\nyet to be found. Giangiulio noted<br />\nthat a request for moving the<br />\nMCATs to the East Baltimore<br />\ncampus was rejected. He also<br />\nstated, however, that some<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community may feel that the MCATs<br />\ntake precedence over the Spring<br />\nFair, and that the fair, not the test,<br />\n<br />\nshould be moved. Other suggestions, such as moving the tests to<br />\nanother school in the Baltimore<br />\narea, were made. As of yet, no<br />\nfinal solution has been reached.<br />\nIn other business, the council<br />\nwas informed that the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies(CUS),<br />\na subcommittee of Academic<br />\nCouncil, has approved a proposal<br />\nto implement writing requirements starting with the Class<br />\nof 1994. The proposal, which has<br />\nnot yet passed in Academic<br />\nCouncil, calls for increased stress<br />\nin the area of writing skills.<br />\nIt has been noticed by several<br />\nof the faculty members that the<br />\nquality of writing of a majority of<br />\nHopkins students was lacking.<br />\nThis new program will stress<br />\n\"writing across the curriculum,\"<br />\na concept meaning that the student will learn to write better<br />\nthrough practical application of<br />\nwriting skills in courses<br />\nspecifically designated as writing<br />\nintensive.<br />\nTo receive a B.A., a student<br />\nwill be required to complete four<br />\ncourses with a heavy concentration of writing during his or her<br />\nacademic career. A B.S. candidate must complete two writing<br />\nintensive courses. The proposal<br />\ncalls for implementation to begin<br />\nwith requiring next year's<br />\nfreshman class to take one of the<br />\ndesignated courses during their<br />\nfour years. This requirement will<br />\nbe increased by one for each consecutive year until the four-course<br />\ngoal is reached.<br />\nThe Bookstore Committee of<br />\nthe council also presented new information. It was reported that<br />\nthe store plans to increase bag<br />\nsecurity with the recent thefts of<br />\nseveral bags left outside the store.<br />\nThe committee reported that, by<br />\nDecember 6, all lockers outside<br />\nof the store will either be fixed<br />\nor replaced.

It is possible that by the end of the 1990 fall<br />\nsemester, the bookstore will have<br />\nexpanded upwards and become a<br />\ntwo-story operation.

Goldfinger<br />\nalso belongs to a program called<br />\nthe Discovery Center which, he<br />\nsays, \"investigates the possibility that the Torah may be based<br />\non provable facts, not just faith.\"<br />\nGoldfinger began his lecture by<br />\nreferring to Inherit the Wind, a<br />\nmovie made about the famous<br />\nScopes trial in Tennessee. He said<br />\nthat the famous trial of the<br />\nbiology teacher accused of promoting evolution in the 1920's\u2014<br />\nin which Clarence Darrow, the<br />\nlawyer for the defense, destroyed<br />\nthe Biblical arguments of William<br />\nJennings<br />\nBryan,<br />\nthe<br />\nprosecutor\u2014marked the ascendancy of science in public opinion<br />\nand the waning of the literal interpretation of the Bible.<br />\nGoldfinger then attempted to<br />\nprove his basic argument, which<br />\nwas that the Jewish traditionalist<br />\nview of Genesis and the view of<br />\nthe scientifically-minded person<br />\nwho knows of evolution and<br />\ncosmology need not be<br />\nincompatible.<br />\nTo do so, he introduced the<br />\nJewish Talmudic concept of the<br />\n`Kascha,' which literally means<br />\nan apparent contradiction in<br />\nscripture where the Talmudic<br />\nRabbis did not shy away from<br />\n`Kaschas,' but rather saw that it<br />\nmeant that the contradiction<br />\nseemed to exist only because their<br />\nview of the problem was incorrect and needed to be changeds<br />\nHe gave an example of the<br />\n`Kascha' in physics, referring to<br />\nthe problem of the wave-particle<br />\nduality of light, an apparent contradiction that was only solved by<br />\nthe advent of quantum<br />\nmechanics, in which the act of<br />\nobservation is taken into account.<br />\nGoldfinger said the apparent<br />\n`Kascha' between Genesis and<br />\nmodern scientific concepts need<br />\nnot indicate that either is incorrect, because the contradiction<br />\nmay only lie in an improper fundamental view of both.<br />\nGoldfinger raised the point that<br />\nGenesis contains two creation<br />\nstories, which seem at first to be<br />\ncontradictory. But he then Mentioned the Rabbinic viewpoint<br />\n<br />\nthat the Torah was written in conceptual order, not chronological,<br />\nand the argument of Rachi that<br />\nthe creation story was a<br />\nlegitimization of Israel and a<br />\nmoral instruction, not a rational<br />\ndescription. The two stories use<br />\ntwo different names for the<br />\ncreator\u2014' Elohim\" symbolizing<br />\nthe God ofjustice and natural and<br />\nmoral law, and \"Yhvh Elohim\"<br />\nin the second story symbolizing<br />\nthis being balanced by mercy and<br />\nkindness.<br />\nHe explained that the Rabbinic<br />\ninterpretation was that the first<br />\nstory dealt with the creation of<br />\nman as a physical being, and that<br />\nthe second story dealt with the<br />\ncreation of the spiritual or 'confronted' man. The first account<br />\ndescribes man as created 'through<br />\nthe forces of nature,' which he<br />\nsuggested could mean the evolutionary process of natural selection; and the second describes<br />\nman as being made from the dust<br />\nof the earth and being given the<br />\n'breath of life,' or the soul.<br />\nThe first account is the creation<br />\nof the world in seven days, after<br />\nthe \"chaotic emptiness\" where<br />\nthe spirit of the Lord moves over<br />\nthe face of the \"waters\" and<br />\ndeclares \"let there be light.\"<br />\nThe first 'day' is the separation<br />\nof light from darkness; the sun<br />\nand moon are only made on the<br />\nfourth 'day' to give men a calendar so they may keep the Sabbath<br />\nand other festivals; the animals<br />\nare made on the sixth 'day,'<br />\nculminating in the decision, \"Let<br />\nus make man in our image,\" in<br />\nwhich Goldfinger says the \"us\"<br />\nrefers to the angels or divine<br />\nforces without free will. The text,<br />\nhe notes, uses the word \"Adam\"<br />\nwhich is not masculine in Hebrew<br />\nbut neuter, and therefore according to the rabbis suggests a hermaphroditic being.<br />\nThe second account says man<br />\nwas raised from the \"dust of the<br />\nearth,\" which he said agrees with<br />\nthe evolutionary biologists today<br />\nwho feel that the redicing atmosphere necessary for the origin<br />\nof organic molecules existed only in clay. In this second account<br />\nthe hermaphrodite \"Adam\" is<br />\nshown all the animals to see<br />\nwhich would be his \"helpmate.\"<br />\nGoldfinger suggested that the<br />\nfact that Adam needed a mate<br />\neven as a hermaphrodite suggested that God meant marriage<br />\nto have more than a reproductive<br />\nfunction. Since all animals are<br />\nunsatisfactory, this \"Adam\" is<br />\nfissioned, and created from him<br />\nis \"Havvah,\" who is called the<br />\n\"Mother of the Living\" even<br />\nthough Adam receives no such<br />\n<br />\nexalted title.<br />\nGoldfinger went on to talk<br />\nabout the modern scientific theory<br />\nof the origin of the universe. He<br />\nsaid that it began with a Big Bang<br />\nin which space expanded like the<br />\nsurface of a balloon into<br />\nnothingness; but also noted that<br />\nthe point of the Big Bang had to<br />\nbe a 'singularity' where the laws<br />\nof physics did not apply and the<br />\nconcept of causation is<br />\nmeaningless.<br />\nHe said that the quantum field<br />\ntheory speaks of the 'physical<br />\nvacuum' as being filled with 'virtual particles' which are present<br />\nbut imperceptible\u2014much like the<br />\n'chaotic nothingness' of Genesis.<br />\nHe also said that quantum theory<br />\nsuggests particles are constantly<br />\nbeing destroyed and recreated<br />\nanew, which agrees with the<br />\nTorah viewpoint that God continually creates the universe. He<br />\nfurther noted that the temperature<br />\nof the initial Big Bang was so<br />\ngreat that no matter could exist,<br />\nonly radiation\u2014so 'light' was the<br />\nfirst thing to be created.<br />\nHis most complicated point<br />\nwas that physics suggests that the<br />\nfour forces of nature\u2014gravity,<br />\nelectromagnetism, strong nuclear<br />\nforce, and the weak force, which<br />\ncauses radioactivity\u2014all were<br />\ncreated from an original fundamental force through 'broken<br />\nsymmetry,' much like the Jewish<br />\nKabbalist conception of \"Tzimtzum\" or the contraction and concealing of God from the world to<br />\nallow people to have free will,<br />\nwhich suggests that the original<br />\nharmony of the universe was<br />\ndisrupted in the \"shattering of the<br />\nvessels.\"<br />\nMoving from cosmology to<br />\nbiology, Goldfinger noted that the<br />\nTalmud suggests that there were<br />\n974 generations of 'men' before<br />\nAdam who were without souls.<br />\nHe suggested that the Creation ex<br />\nnihilo(or creation out of nothing<br />\n<br />\nsaid to have taken place for man)<br />\nreferred to the soul given to this<br />\nsoulless hermaphrodite being.<br />\nGoldfinger spoke of the<br />\nbiologists who had traced the<br />\nmitochondrial DNA (which is<br />\npassed only through the mother,<br />\nnot through both parents) of<br />\nhumanity and discovered that<br />\nhomo sapiens might have a common ancestor, 'Eve,' who lived<br />\nin Africa some 200,000 years<br />\nago\u2014much as Genesis speaks of<br />\nthe \"Mother of all Living.\" He<br />\nsuggested that the Cro-Magnons<br />\ndescended from the 'Eve'<br />\neradicated the Neanderthals in<br />\nEurope, who were the \"preAdamites\" of Torah.<br />\nGoldfinger then went on to deal<br />\nwith his ultimate `Kascha,' which<br />\nwas reconciling the six days of<br />\nGenesis with the fifteen-billionyear-old universe. To deal with<br />\nthis, he referred to Einstein's<br />\ntheory of special relativity, which<br />\nsuggests that time is a relative<br />\nquantity and not absolute\u2014a day<br />\nfor a man traveling in a spaceship<br />\nnear the speed of light could be<br />\nyears for his brother stationary at<br />\nhome.<br />\nHe said that the contradiction<br />\ncould be resolved by understanding that fifteen billion years<br />\ncould relativistically be only six<br />\ndays for the Creator's reference<br />\nframe outside the virtual<br />\nspacetime of the world.<br />\nWhile Goldfinger managed to<br />\ncombine some esoteric physics<br />\nand biology with some equally<br />\nesoteric Talmudic and Kabbalistic<br />\nexegesis of the Torah to get the<br />\nBiblical Creation account to agree<br />\nwith the Big Bang evolutionary<br />\nmodel, many present were not<br />\ncompletely convinced. As a<br />\nresult, he suggested that they attend a Discovery Seminar which<br />\nwill be held in February 1990 to<br />\ndeal with some concepts which he<br />\ndid not cover, such as the<br />\nlegitimacy of the \"oral Torah.\"<br />\n<br />\nCampus Crime<br />\nComplainant reported that between October 17, 1989 and<br />\nOctober 18, 1989 some person(s) unknown removed from<br />\nthe lobby of McCoy Hall one<br />\n(1) sofa valued at $200.00.<br />\nComplainant reports he placed his personal property in a<br />\ndaily use locker at the Athletic<br />\nCenter while using the pool.<br />\nSometime on October 13, person(s) unknown forced open<br />\nthe locker door and removed<br />\nhis gents wallet containing personal papers and $35.00<br />\n<br />\nComplainant reports that<br />\nsometime on October 13, 1989<br />\nperson(s) unknown removed<br />\nan AT&T telephone from a<br />\ndesk top in Merryman Hall.<br />\nValue of phone was placed at<br />\n$440.00.<br />\nComplainant reported that between October 18, 1989 and<br />\nOctober 19, 1989 some person(s) unknown removed from<br />\na laundry room in McCoy Hall<br />\na quantity of clothing valued at<br />\n$75.00.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak \u2022International Experts\u2022Tour Packages\u2022Cruises\u2022Free V.I.P.

Our minds set<br />\nup an attitude for us with which<br />\nwe view the world, and eventually, the way we think and act is<br />\nreflected in the things we experience. An extension of the \"be<br />\ncareful what you wish for, for<br />\nyou shall surely get it\" mentality. I understand that. I guess that<br />\nmy thinking must be very circular<br />\nand self-enveloping, is all. Let me<br />\nexplain:<br />\nWhen I was in high school, for<br />\na time I was known for my quick<br />\nrecovery periods after being jilted<br />\nby the girls I dated (largely due<br />\nto the fact that so many in the row<br />\nbroke up with me). In fact, more<br />\nthan once a young lady, in ending<br />\na particular relationship with me,<br />\ntold me how to get in touch with<br />\nsomeone else in whom I might be<br />\ninterested.<br />\nNow, the first time a girl broke<br />\nup with me, like any Catholicraised child, I assumed that I haA<br />\ndone something wrong. I assumed that in some way, I had made<br />\nthe relationship fail; I was not<br />\nmeeting the needs of my steady.<br />\nI tried harder. I made the girls<br />\nI dated the subjects of my utmost<br />\nattention. So much so that I forgot<br />\nthe reason why I started, and it<br />\njust became a staple with me to<br />\nobsess about women.<br />\nBut they still kept jilting me.<br />\nHere I noticed a pattern in my<br />\nlife, the circle of history repeating<br />\nitself. That was when I realized<br />\nthat deja vu isn't a real<br />\nphenomenon; deja vu doesn't<br />\nmean you've been there before,<br />\nit's usually means you've just<br />\nseen it coming.<br />\nAround my eleventh relation:ship, I decided I should ask what<br />\nI was doing wrong. Obviously<br />\nmy focus was somewhat skewed.<br />\n\"Well, Chris, I just think<br />\nyou're a little too intense for me.<br />\nI think you're more serious than<br />\nI want to be.\"<br />\n\"Well, what can I do to prove<br />\n<br />\nGiven the News-Letter's role as the student-run newspaper,<br />\nwe might be forgiven for a bias in favor of things literary.<br />\nNevertheless, the Committee of Undergraduate Studies'<br />\nproposal to require writing credits for all undergraduates<br />\nis an excellent one. Accurate communication, whether<br />\nthrough newspapers, journals, letters and even computer<br />\nscreens is vital for the successful exchange of news, information, and most importantly, ideas.<br />\nThe CUS proposal, if passed by the Academic Council, would affect both the School of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nthe G. W. C. Whiting School of Engineering. Aspiring<br />\nwriters in the Writing Seminars Department and students<br />\nmajoring in English clearly require strong writing skills,<br />\nbut it is equally important that engineers, physicists,<br />\nmathematicians, and yes, even pre-meds are able communicate via the written word.

After all, despite distributional requirements,<br />\nWriting Seminars majors are not specifically required to<br />\ntake Fluid Mechanics in order to satisfy Q credits.<br />\nThe very necessity of a writing requirement at the<br />\nuniversity level indicates a deeper, troubling deficiency<br />\nin the American educational system.

But if he<br />\ncan't lift the rock, he's not all<br />\npowerful, ieither.

The GRO had originally asked<br />\nfor a breakdown of how the<br />\nmoney was to be spent. On Oct.<br />\n11, this was provided, and the<br />\ncouncil unanimously agreed to<br />\ngrant $300 from its Grad Support<br />\nbudget.<br />\nInternational Indoor Soccer<br />\nClub, an off-campus soccer team<br />\ncomposed partly of Hopkins grad<br />\nstudents, asked for a discretionary<br />\namount to be granted by the GRO<br />\nto help fund publicity. The GRO<br />\nsteering committee recommended that no funding be granted, as<br />\nthe team was not campus-oriented<br />\nenough. The council disagreed,<br />\nhowever, voting to table the motion until team spokesman Robert<br />\nHiggins could find out more<br />\nabout alternative funding and/or<br />\nhow the undergrad soccer club is<br />\norganized. The Union ofJewish Graduate<br />\nStudents requested $2,370 for the<br />\nfunding of a lecture series<br />\n($1,300) and the purchase of a<br />\nfull-volume set of the Talmud<br />\n($1,070).

According to<br />\nthe editorial, fraternities, all<br />\nfraternities, function out of a<br />\n\"perverted sense of loyalty,\" are<br />\n\"pervasive...1in] fostering<br />\nsubstance abuse,\" and threaten<br />\nthe rest of an \"intellectually<br />\nvibrant campus...at the roots.\"<br />\nI have two interpretations of<br />\nthis editorial, and neither is flattering to the News-Letter. The<br />\nfirst is that the News-Letter staff<br />\nbelieve that they and the rest of<br />\nthe Hopkins community walk<br />\naround in fear of anyone wearing<br />\nfraternity letters. The NewsLetter is essentially comparing<br />\nHopkins students (engineers,<br />\nwriting majors, pre-meds, etc.)<br />\nwho wear Greek Letters to gangs<br />\nof thugs who wear colors. This<br />\nis preposterous.<br />\nMy second interpretation is that<br />\nthe editorialist let his article and<br />\nhis language get out of control,<br />\nas is evidenced by the above<br />\nquotations. In either case<br />\napologies are due. The NewsLetter is promoting Greek<br />\nbashing.<br />\nAs President of DU, I don't<br />\nwant to News-Letter bash.<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes letters to<br />\nthe editors. Letters must be types,<br />\ndouble spaced, and include the<br />\nauthor's name for verification purposes. Letters should not exceed 300<br />\nwords. The News-Letter reserves the<br />\nright to edit for condensation. Letters<br />\nmust be delivered to the Gatehouse<br />\nby Tuesday at 5 pm for inclusion in<br />\nthat Friday's paper. Once a letter is<br />\ndelivered it becomes the property of<br />\ntheNews-Letter. Letters must be signed by at least one and no more than<br />\ntwo persons. Letters credited to only to organizations will not be printed.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, I would like to see the<br />\nNews-Letter produce responsible<br />\njournalism and admit this last<br />\nmistake. In an attempt to promote<br />\na better Hopkins community,<br />\nthey are instead only exacerbating<br />\nsituations.<br />\nIn my three years at JHU the<br />\nonly publicity afforded DU has<br />\nbeen negative. In fact, the vast<br />\nmajority of News-Letter the conwritten on or about the fraternity<br />\nsystem have been negative.<br />\nMyself and the officers of my<br />\nfraternity would be more than<br />\nhappy to sit down and discuss<br />\nwith the News-Letter the contributions we have made to both<br />\nthe Hopkins and Baltimore<br />\ncommunities.<br />\nI feel pleased to sign this letter<br />\nin response to an unsigned<br />\neditorial, and challenge the<br />\nNews-Letter to work with the<br />\nGreek system, instead of harassing<br />\nit<br />\nunfounded<br />\nwith<br />\naccusations.<br />\nJason T. Levine<br />\nPresident, Delta Upsilon<br />\nFraternity<br />\n<br />\non the fraternity system, and suggests that the University should<br />\n\"take steps to phase out the<br />\nGreek system.\" This kind of action would be foolhardy, placing<br />\nan even larger barrier between the<br />\nstudents and the University.<br />\nThe function of a fraternity/sorority goes far beyond being<br />\njust a party-holding institution.<br />\nThey are not drinking clubs, and<br />\nany chapter whose main function<br />\nis merely to hold parties will<br />\nassuredly be disbanded. Every<br />\nGreek organization has zerotolerance for any substance<br />\nabuse, and is thus held accountable for its actions not only by<br />\nthe administration, but by interested parties at both a national<br />\nand local level. On the positive<br />\nside, Greeks provide students<br />\nwith the opportunity to work<br />\ntogether as a unit to achieve goals<br />\nwhich will benefit themselves, the<br />\ncommunity, and the University.<br />\nMany examples of this kind of<br />\ngroup effort can be witnessed<br />\neach year, such as the Phi Psi<br />\n500, ATO's initiation of<br />\nMaryland's Governor Schaefer,<br />\nEditors' Note: the N-L quota- and the many coordinated comtions, in context, read, \"While munity service projects underthe majority offraternity members taken by every fraternity and<br />\nare undoubtedly sufficiently sorority.<br />\nmature and confident in the value<br />\nSubstance abuse is a nationoftheir institutions to allow such wide problem not to be easily and<br />\na letter to stand, without feeling carelessly blamed on the fratercompelled to respond with in- nal system.

The letter in last<br />\nweek's issue, while it places the<br />\nblame of the problem on some of<br />\nthe correct sources, emphasizes<br />\nthe wrong reasons for doing so<br />\nand the wrong way to deal with it.<br />\nThe author of the letter claims<br />\nthat \"the main focus of [Greek]<br />\n'parties' is alcohol and drugs\"<br />\nand that \"serious steps against<br />\nsubstance abuse in the community<br />\nshould start by taking steps to<br />\nphase out the Greek system.\"<br />\nThat many parties display large<br />\namounts of alcohol is true and<br />\nvery disturbing. However, the<br />\nproper remedy for this situation<br />\nshould not be the dismantling of<br />\nthe Greek system, but rather a<br />\n<br />\ngreater awareness of responsibility within it. Most fraternities<br />\nserve alternate beverages at parties, as well as provide escorts to<br />\nensure that guests return home<br />\nsafely. What is not done is the<br />\nproper advertising of these facts.<br />\nSigns should be prominently<br />\nposted to alert guests as to the<br />\nchoice of non-alcoholic beverages<br />\nand escorts should be clearly<br />\ndistinguished by tags or vests. It<br />\nis also the fraternity or sorority's<br />\nresponsibility to know when to<br />\nrefuse to serve guests who have<br />\nobviously drunk too much.<br />\nAnother responsibility of<br />\nGreek organizations is to seek<br />\nalternative social events. Fraternity and sorority parties are the<br />\n<br />\nmost visible actions of the Greek<br />\nsystem, but they need not all be<br />\nwet. An example of a nonalcoholic social event was the dry<br />\nparty held yesterday in the Terrace Room by Kappa Sigma and<br />\nResidential Life in support of<br />\nAlcohol Awareness Week.<br />\nSimilar events should be planned and executed by other Greek<br />\norganizations on campus.<br />\nPerhaps the largest fault,<br />\nhowever, lies with the entire student body. While the Greeks<br />\nmight hold the parties, there is<br />\na large number of non-Greeks<br />\nwho attend them. It is quite an obvious fact that these guests often<br />\nSee Letters, 9<br />\n<br />\nPunchline<br />\nPunch, from 6<br />\nyou draw, the inside of the picture is always indistinguishable<br />\nfrom the outside, and the first line<br />\nyou draw always ends up being<br />\nthe last one.

Unfortunately,<br />\nspace limitations allow me to<br />\nmerely point out a few of the<br />\nmore glaring difficulties.<br />\n1) Officer Reiss states that \"the<br />\ncrack wave hasn't really hit<br />\nBaltimore yet,\" even though<br />\nSpin magazine ran an article four<br />\nyears ago on crack and Baltimore<br />\nas one of its points of origin.<br />\nHere, as throughout the article,<br />\nMr. Varon is relying on the<br />\npossibly biased and unreliable information given by one or two<br />\nsources, instead of conducting the<br />\npersonal research and analysis<br />\nthat is essential to accurate<br />\nreporting.<br />\n2) What precisely are \"hard<br />\ndrugs\"? Mr. Varon uses this<br />\nterm several times without ever<br />\ndefining it. Officer Larkin states<br />\nthat no one has ever been taken<br />\nto Union Memorial for OD'ing<br />\non hard drugs, which must mean<br />\nthat they OD'ed on marijuana or<br />\nalcohol. It is impossible,<br />\nhowever, to OD on marijuana.<br />\nAre we to believe then that<br />\nalcohol, which can very easily<br />\n<br />\nkill you, is not a hard drug? Furthermore, how can 'shrooms,<br />\nwhich are physically nonaddictive, have no lasting<br />\nphysical effects, and which, to<br />\nmy knowledge, have never killed anyone, even be mentioned in<br />\nthe same breath with cocaine as<br />\na \"hard drug?\" These<br />\nstatements, like so much of Mr.<br />\nVaron's article, seem to be based<br />\non the subjective opinions and<br />\nexperiences of Mr. Varon and his<br />\nlimited sources, and have no<br />\nplace in serious journalism.<br />\nIn general, Mr. Varon's article<br />\nreminds me of an old Doonesbury<br />\ncartoon, in which Zonker convinces reporter Roland Hedley<br />\nthat a lilac bush is a marijuana<br />\nplant. Mr. Varon, like Roland,<br />\nseems to have neither the experience or wisdom to find the<br />\nreal facts, or the ability to report<br />\nthem in an accurate, unbiased<br />\nmanner.<br />\nPhil Gochenour<br />\nClass of '89<br />\n<br />\nRosen I<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs President of the Gay and<br />\nLesbian Alliance I would like to<br />\nthank James Rosen for<br />\nacknowledging the existence of<br />\nour group. Reading his strip I can<br />\ntell James must regularly attend<br />\nour meetings in order to have<br />\nsuch an accurate description of<br />\nwhat occurs at them.<br />\nIt isn't every day that the NewsLetter addresses anything GALA<br />\nrepresents or does. Even being<br />\nfeatured in \"With Eyes Closed\"<br />\nseems like such a triumph. Why<br />\nshould the News-Letter waste<br />\nvaluable column space discussing<br />\nhow our weekly posters are torn<br />\ndown from campus bulletin<br />\nboards almost as fast as they are<br />\nput up'? Why lose ink addressing<br />\nthe fact that not too long ago an<br />\nundergraduate committed suicide<br />\npartly due to his inability, while<br />\nliving at Hopkins, to deal with his<br />\n<br />\nown sexual orientation? Why<br />\nmisuse precious paper explaining<br />\nthat the black boxes over the faces<br />\nof Rosen's characters are a reality<br />\nat Hopkins and not a joke? But,<br />\nI'm digressing from what I<br />\nwanted to be a laudatory tone.<br />\nWhy should anyone expect the<br />\nNews-Letter to address a reality<br />\nwhen lampooning is so much<br />\nmore fun? Thank you James and<br />\nI hope that you remember our little group in the future.<br />\nI sympathize with the NewsLetter's policy not to print<br />\nanonymous letters to the editor.<br />\nI'm sure that already bending this<br />\nrule twice this year has been a difficult decision. My situation,<br />\nhowever, requires ;ne to request<br />\nthat the News-Letier bend the<br />\nrules once again. In the past,<br />\nmembers of GALA who have<br />\nallowed their identities to be<br />\npublicly known have been met<br />\nwith threats and in short have had<br />\ntheir lives made difficult in<br />\nseveral ways. On the other hand,<br />\nanyone who wishes to know me<br />\nor respond to me in person could<br />\neasily find me at any meeting of<br />\nGALA. I think requesting<br />\nanonymity demonstrates even<br />\nfurther the real prejudices on this<br />\ncampus which pats itself on the<br />\nback for its intellectual greatness<br />\nwith one hand and covers up its<br />\nsometimes vicious intolerance<br />\nwith the other.<br />\nOh, and by the way, at our last<br />\nmeeting we were discussing your<br />\nreference to Kenny Rogers and<br />\njackboots. Pardon our ignorance,<br />\nJames, but we have no idea what<br />\nyou are talking about. Perhaps<br />\nyou're into some leather and<br />\nchains scene or something, but<br />\nthat's far too radical for our conservative tastes. Maybe you could<br />\nclarify some of that stuff in your<br />\nnext strip.

Such incidents,<br />\nhowever, are rare and are considered unacceptable by virtually all members of the Hopkins'<br />\ncommunity. Far more insidious,<br />\nthough less newsworthy, are the<br />\ncommonplace actions which reinforce bigotry in our society. You<br />\nurged us all to \"reevaluate our<br />\nbehavior and feelings towards<br />\nthose who may not belong to our<br />\nown private corner of Hopkins<br />\nand the world in general.\" Yet,<br />\non the following page you chose<br />\nto publish a cartoon which was<br />\noffensive and degrading to one<br />\nparticular<br />\nHopkins' and<br />\nworldwide population.

For<br />\nsome reason, in the last couple of<br />\nyears this popularity dwindled to<br />\na level which made it very hard<br />\nto continue operations. At the<br />\nbeginning of this year, the new<br />\nmanagers and bartenders were<br />\ncharged with one task: turn the<br />\n<br />\nplace around.<br />\nThis has not been an easy task.<br />\nDespite a lot of extra work by the<br />\nstaff in improvements to the<br />\nmenu, a host of promotional activities, and an attitude which<br />\ndisplays real concern for the success of the Grad Club, admittedly the crowds(and the profit) are<br />\nyet in-coming.<br />\nThere has always been talk on<br />\ncampus about a lack of concern<br />\nfrom the administration about the<br />\nquality of student life here at<br />\nHopkins. While this may be true<br />\nto some extent, the state of the<br />\nGrad Club for the past few years<br />\nseems to indicate that students<br />\nhave not cared themselves. It is<br />\nhard to believe that students<br />\nwould not seek out a place such<br />\nas the Grad Club, since it's<br />\ncheaper than the other alternatives<br />\nin the neighborhood and designed for the exclusive use of<br />\nHopkins students and their<br />\nguests. The Club should be packed every night.<br />\nTo all students, especially the<br />\ngraduate students, I am encouraging your return to the Grad Club.<br />\nWhy? First, the Grad Club has an<br />\natmosphere conducive to socializing and/or group study.

In a<br />\nword, senior John Tennyson is<br />\nvariety.<br />\nTennyson vividly remembers<br />\nthe summer of his Junior year in<br />\nhigh school. As an exchange student to Japan in 1985, John was<br />\nable to buy himself his first synthesizer at half the price.<br />\nIt was something that had<br />\namazed him years before in a<br />\nmusic store when he first heard<br />\nthe realistic sound of an electronic<br />\ndrum, but something that was too<br />\nexpensive in America. Finally,<br />\nJohn was able to fully express his<br />\nmusical talents.<br />\nWhile at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, Tennyson has been a<br />\nregular contestant in the annual<br />\nMusical Showcase Talent Show,<br />\nwhich he won two years ago.<br />\nDecember 7th of last year also<br />\nmarked his first solo multimedia<br />\nconcert, FUNK YOU.<br />\nNot only is John Tennyson a<br />\nman of music and psychology, he<br />\nis also a man of philosophy and<br />\nmeaning. For example, Tennyson<br />\nplayed in the Hopkins Electronic<br />\nLive Saving Project (HELP)<br />\nsponsored by the Synth Club, in<br />\nwhich all the proceeds were<br />\ndonated to the Hopkins AIDS<br />\nInstitute.<br />\nWhen asked what makes him<br />\nsuch an interesting person, Tennyson chuckles and makes a statement of not wanting to sound<br />\ncondescending.<br />\n<br />\n\"I try to be open-minded and<br />\ntie that into my music. I like to<br />\naddress issues that people tend to<br />\nignore. My music isn't so much<br />\nabout social issues, but more<br />\nabout philosophical truths.\"<br />\nFor instance, in his song titled<br />\n\"Hate,\" he talks about yin-yang<br />\nand the nature of hate and love.<br />\nTo many people, the lyrics may<br />\nseem somewhat \"cynical\" and<br />\n\"make them feel uncomfortable,\" he says. But he tries to<br />\nspeak in simple language, such<br />\n<br />\nSpotlight<br />\nOn<br />\nA<br />\nHopkins<br />\nStudent<br />\nas: \"We all need something to<br />\nhate, hate means as much as<br />\nlove.\"<br />\nFrom academics to music, John<br />\nTennyson considers himself an<br />\nessentialist and an agnostic.<br />\nEntering Hopkins as a pre-med<br />\nmajoring in Behavioral Biology,<br />\nhe eventually found out that he<br />\ndidn't have the right personality<br />\nto do research.<br />\nTennyson says that the reason<br />\nthat he plays music is not for any<br />\nintellectual purposes. He does it<br />\n<br />\nfor the way it makes him feel.<br />\nTennyson's philosophy of life is<br />\nupbeat.<br />\n\"Do what makes you happy.<br />\nCollege is a place for discovery<br />\nfor me, even in the rat race of<br />\ncareers and jobs. Life is only so<br />\nlong. Do what you want to be<br />\nhappy. I've seen people that<br />\nhaven't thought about these things<br />\nand they may even hate their<br />\nclasses.\"<br />\nTennyson believes that people<br />\nneed to feel out their goals.<br />\n\"To me, variety is the very<br />\nspice of life. Sample and find the<br />\nthings that you may not think as<br />\npossible to do; explore the<br />\navenues.

The unusual building is<br />\nnoteworthy at quite a distance<br />\nwith its atypical architecture and<br />\ngrand profile. Set in the middle<br />\nof this building, between two<br />\nsmall shops housed at the sides,<br />\nis a large, forbidding door With<br />\na bright green welcome mat in<br />\nfront of it that boldly screams<br />\n\"The Professional Building.\"<br />\nBehind these doors, down the<br />\ncorridor, and up the stairs on the<br />\nfifth floor is the new headquarters<br />\nof Baltimore Living, one of the city's more valuable, if unknown,<br />\ngold mines of information.<br />\nBaltimore Living is, at its most<br />\nbasic level, an effort to promote<br />\nliving in downtown Baltimore.<br />\nThe service, sponsored by the City of Baltimore, was founded as<br />\na proactive marketing effort to<br />\nincrease the number of people living in the downtown area. It is a<br />\nfree, ready source of information<br />\non every aspect of the downtown<br />\narea\u2014be it housing opportunities<br />\nor lifestyle information.<br />\nWhatever type of information<br />\nyou need, including apartments,<br />\ntownhouses, condominiums, and<br />\nrentals, or the various amenities<br />\nthe city has to offer\u2014like sports<br />\nfacilities, shopping, and cultural<br />\nevents\u2014or whatever else you<br />\nneed to know about the city,<br />\nBaltimore Living is the place to<br />\n<br />\nturn.<br />\nIn the words of Bruce Lubart,<br />\nwho runs Baltimore Living, the<br />\nservice exists \"to compliment<br />\nother possible sources of information...not to compete with them.\"<br />\nIn addition to their own information, the service keeps tabs on<br />\nother sources. If someone contacts them, they can refer that<br />\nperson somewhere to have his<br />\nquestions answered.<br />\nIn the near future people may<br />\nhave even newer and better<br />\nsources of Baltimore Livingsponsored information as well:<br />\nthe service is currently planning<br />\na list of important phone numbers<br />\nfor people new to the city.<br />\nLikewise, the office eventually<br />\nhopes to put together some information comparing the cost of living in Baltimore with that of living in other cities.<br />\nOne of the many ways in which<br />\nBaltimore Living promotes the city is through outreach programs.<br />\nThe service has ties with several<br />\ncompanies and even some universities. For them Baltimore Living<br />\nis a resource: it helps sell the city to prospective employees or<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAll the company or college has<br />\nto do is get prospective<br />\nBaltimoreans there; Baltimore<br />\nLiving handles the rest. Similarly, the office gets many referals<br />\nfrom different businesses in the<br />\ncity.<br />\nPossibly the best\u2014and definitely the most important\u2014way in<br />\nwhich the service promotes the<br />\ncity is through direct communication. Either dropping by their<br />\noffice\u2014open from nine to five<br />\nMondays through Fridays,<br />\n<br />\nlocated at 330 North Charles (call<br />\nfirst)\u2014or by calling them at<br />\n685-LIVE, you can get the information you need.<br />\nAnother way in which<br />\nBaltimore Living promotes the city is a free program called \"Go<br />\nto Town,\" an introduction to the<br />\ndowntown area. This program is<br />\nscheduled again for next spring,<br />\npossibly in April and will be run<br />\nfor a third time.<br />\nWhat the program consists of<br />\nis a two-day weekend tour of the<br />\ndowntown area. People interested<br />\nin participating go to a starting<br />\npoint, get on a bus or van, and<br />\nare taken off to and shown a<br />\nspecific area of the city.<br />\nOnce there, they can get a feel<br />\nfor the area. They can get off the<br />\nbus, walk around, and see what<br />\nit's like to actually live there.<br />\nAt the end of the tour they are<br />\nreturned to their starting point.<br />\nThe last time that the program<br />\nwas run it was extremely successful: over four hundred people participated. Some of them<br />\nwere actual residents of the city<br />\nitself.<br />\nMany remarked that they<br />\ncouldn't believe what they'd just<br />\nseen. They had no idea of some<br />\nof the attractions the city has to<br />\noffer.<br />\nSo, in the near future, if you<br />\nwant to learn about Baltimore,<br />\ngive them a call. They might have<br />\nsomething for you. And come<br />\nApril, if you have some free time,<br />\ngo to \"Go to Town.\" You just<br />\nmight decide you like Baltimore<br />\nenough to live here.

Despite<br />\nsome unfortunate inconsistencies from this often<br />\nimpeccable group, their recital on October 14 still<br />\nthrilled the audience at the inaugural concert of<br />\nShriver Hall's 24th Concert Series season.<br />\nMore often than not, the Beaux Arts Trio<br />\ndelivers live performances of near-perfect quality. The members collectively possess a stunning<br />\npalate of musical ideas. Well-choreographed<br />\nmovements emphasize contrapuntal and harmonic<br />\nstructures, subtle phrasing allows melodies to melt<br />\ninto thin air, and technical virtuosity adds fuel to<br />\nthe fire of musicality.<br />\nIndividual moments did measure up to the Beaux<br />\nArts' usual quality. During the G-minor Trio, Op.<br />\n15, of Bedrich Smetana, for example, a feverish<br />\nlevel of emotional intensity was charged by some<br />\nof the Beaux Arts' most rhythmically precise<br />\nensemble playing of recent years.<br />\nAs far as delicacy is concerned, the third movement, Allegretto ma non troppo, of Beethoven's<br />\nE-flat Trio, Op. 70 no. 2, took the prize. In a<br />\ndialogue between piano and violin, the primary<br />\ntheme was manipulated by two masters, pianist<br />\nMenahem Pressler and violinist Isidore Cohen.<br />\nPressler favored a thoughtful, tenuto phrasing<br />\nwhile Cohen gave a straightforward account of<br />\nsublime lyricism. What could have been a tug-ofwar emerged as a smooth volley.<br />\nBut the most consistently exciting music of the<br />\nevening was made by cellist Peter Wiley, whose<br />\nmembership in the Trio began only in 1988, 33<br />\nyears after its official debut. Wiley's playing took<br />\non a quality of vocal imitation in the Smetana Trio.<br />\nEven if his stone cold face did not mirror the<br />\nsound, he certainly was able to express Smetana's<br />\ninner torment in this piece, written after the tragic<br />\n<br />\non Hun-stein<br />\n<br />\nThe Beaux Arts Trio\u2014from left, Isidore Cohen, Peter Wiley and Menahem Pressler\u2014inaugurated the 34th annual Shriver Hall Concert Series last Saturday.<br />\ndeath of the composer's daughter. Wiley stressed the programmatic aspects of the work, making tender elegies of the more lyrical themes in<br />\nthe second and third movements.<br />\nAs a whole, though, the Beaux Arts did not present as awe-inspiring a performance as the public<br />\nhas come to expect. It seemed the most formidable<br />\nweakness was one of technical origin. Careless<br />\nis not a word often associated with the Beaux Arts,<br />\nbut unfortunately some of the playing was just this.<br />\nThe Beaux Arts' best recent work has been with<br />\ncompositions of a more elegant, linear style.<br />\nPressler's dazzling dexterity and both string<br />\nplayers' sensitivity have provided an exciting<br />\nframework for unparalleled performances of trios<br />\n<br />\nby such diverse composers as Haydn and<br />\nShostakovich. Unfortunately, the Haydn E-flat<br />\nTrio, Hob. XV:10, was less than charming. Sloppy passagework in each instrument hinted from<br />\nthe beginning that the Beaux Arts was having a<br />\nproverbial \"bad night.\"<br />\nCertainly a few dropped notes in the Smetana<br />\nTrio posed no threat to a climactic performance.<br />\nBut in the final movement of the Beethoven, even<br />\nPressler's finesse could not mask a serious case<br />\nof fumbling through the monstrous piano part.<br />\nSmetana's heart-on-the-sleeve romanticism does<br />\nnot necessitate absolute exactness of detail; but<br />\nBeethoven's compositional precision discourages<br />\nsuch inaccuracies.<br />\n<br />\nThe Beaux Arts Trio has done more for the promotion of the trio repertoire than any other group<br />\nin history. Its discography spans the entirety of<br />\ntrio literature. The program selection for the<br />\nShriver Hall concert, however, was something less<br />\nthan exciting. Aaron Copland's \"Vitebsk\" has not<br />\naged well since its premiere in 1929; watching<br />\nPressler's characteristic pedagogue-defying<br />\npianism proved far more interesting than the<br />\nmicrotonal music. Beethoven's Op. 70 no. 2 lacks<br />\nhis usual flair for works in this genre; it is<br />\nsomewhat unexceptional in its content. And the<br />\nSmetana Trio, while deserving to be played more<br />\nfrequently, is hardly of the stature necessary to<br />\ncarry a two-hour program.<br />\n<br />\nThanks to Marlon<br />\nBrando, 'Dry White<br />\nSeason' Succeeds<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nEuzhan Palcy's \"A Dry White Season\" begins<br />\ndeceptively, with two young boys, one black and<br />\none white, energetically playing soccer. Soon the<br />\ngame becomes more confrontational, if still<br />\nplayful; finally the two boys are on the ground,<br />\ntrying to wrench the ball away from each other.<br />\nThe irony of Palcy's visual metaphor, with the<br />\na capella harmonies of Ladysmith Black Mambazo<br />\nin the background, isn't lost on the audience. Black<br />\nand white hands literally ripping the world apart<br />\nare the subject of this well-crafted and disturbing<br />\nfilm.<br />\nSet in South Africa during the 1976 Soweto<br />\nuprising, \"A Dry White Season\" addresses the<br />\nuprising itself somewhat awkwardly. The blacks<br />\nin the townships demand to be taught in English,<br />\nnot Afrikaan, and Paley frames their protest more<br />\nlike a choreographed dance number than an expression of righteous anger. Paley intersperses<br />\nthese scenes from the rioting with the pastoral tranquility of Ben du Toit(Donald Sutherland), a white<br />\nhistory professor whose only tie to the black<br />\ntownships and blacks themselves is his gardener,<br />\nGordon Ngubene (Winston Ntshona), and his<br />\nfamily.<br />\nThese early moments are the only ones in the<br />\nfilm we cannot trust. Paley has difficulty moving<br />\nfrom the spectacle of mass protest to the relative<br />\nquietude of Ben's home; she's better off with the<br />\nintimate character studies that dominate the rest<br />\nof the film. \"A Dry White Season\" succeeds on<br />\na personal level, with each face and segment of<br />\ndialogue etched in our memory, and emotions<br />\nneatly packaged, transmitted and understood. It<br />\nis not a sprawling South African film, like Richard<br />\nAttenborough's \"Cry Freedom,\" but it doesn't<br />\nneed to be.<br />\nBen is drawn into the plight of South African<br />\nblacks when he discovers that Gordon's son has<br />\nbeen detained and killed during the uprising.<br />\nAlthough Ben empathizes, it's half-hearted. Concern for the plight of blacks has not yet awakened in him. He's not evil, just ignorant, looking the other way. He urges Gordon to forget his<br />\nson, as one might forget a dead pet.<br />\nBut Gordon won't forget and along with his wife<br />\nand cynical friend Stanley (Zakes Mokae), begins<br />\nto investigate his son's death. Soon Gordon is detained by South Africa's Special Branch, a sadistic<br />\ngroup of inquisitors led by Captain Stolz (Jurgen<br />\nProchnow). According to the police, Gordon<br />\n<br />\nhangs himself in his cell shortly thereafter. But<br />\nafter one look at the body, Ben knows otherwise.<br />\nIt is the sight of Gordon's beaten and disfigured<br />\ncorpse that convinces Ben\u2014and the audience\u2014to<br />\ntake up Gordon's cause. In fact, all of the images<br />\nin \"A Dry White Season\" are visceral and border<br />\non the overpowering. Seeing Gordon really only<br />\naffirms our interest; we've already been sickened and convinced by the previously displayed tidy<br />\nrows of slaughtered black schoolchildren in their<br />\nuniforms, damp with blood.<br />\nInevitably, Ben becomes the axis of the film,<br />\nputting the building blocks of his life blindly at<br />\nrisk for the cause he has only recently discovered.<br />\nPaley and co-writer Colin Welland take the film<br />\nin this predictable direction, since movies about<br />\nrace relations simply don't get made unless the<br />\nmain character is white. Like \"Cry Freedom,\"<br />\nin which Steven Biko is murdered in the first thirty<br />\nminutes, the real heroes of\"A Dry White Season\"<br />\nare eliminated early on. And they leave nothing<br />\nbut pseudoheroes: people who can be inspiring,<br />\nbut who still seem hollow and dippy in<br />\ncomparison.<br />\nSutherland's acting is accomplished, but just as<br />\nhe's about to come into his own, he gets the carpet<br />\npulled out from under him by Marlon Brando.<br />\nBrando is mesmerizing as rotund barrister Sheldon<br />\nMcKenzie, a venerable human rights champion<br />\nasked to take one last case. He hesitates at first<br />\nwhen Ben asks for justice, then chides him in an<br />\ninimitable low growl.<br />\n\"Justice and law are distant cousins, Mr. du<br />\nToit,\" McKenzie says, \"and here in South Africa<br />\nthey're not on speaking terms at all.\" The inherent<br />\nmelodrama in the court of law has never been so<br />\nastonishingly reproduced.<br />\nWords spill out of Brando's mouth like<br />\nmolasses, and we wait patiently on every one of<br />\nthem. It is easy to forsee McKenzie's huge frame<br />\njust swallowing up \"A Dry White Season,\" but<br />\nhe's gone when Gordon's inquest ends. Despite<br />\nthe horrifying details of the inquest, we wish it<br />\nto go on and on. Brando captivates in every frame,<br />\nsnarling and floating through the courtroom with<br />\nthe predatory grace of a stately lion.<br />\nWhat is remarkable besides Brando's performance is the rapidity with which the character is<br />\nfamiliar to us. McKenzie is not a cliche by any<br />\nmeans; in fact, we have sadly little body of<br />\nreference to refer him to. The same is true of<br />\nMelanie, the journalist played by Susan Sarandon.<br />\nMelanie may be just another jaded reporter, but<br />\n<br />\nMarlon Brando (left) and Donald Sutherland in Euzhan Palcy's\"A Dry White Season\"<br />\nshe plays off Sutherland's character brilliantly,<br />\nmaking him aware ofjust how little about South<br />\nAfrica he really knows. Like McKenzie, Melanie<br />\ncould be a movie in herself. But Palcy keeps her<br />\npart neat and tidy and doesn't allow \"A Dry White<br />\nSeason\" to get distracted by these minor<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nAnd Paley keeps the pressure on. Gordon's defiant wife is killed after refusing to obey an eviction notice, and the flashbacks of her resistance<br />\nerupt like staccato bursts of machinegun fire. The<br />\nvalue of Ben's life continues to erode; he loses<br />\nhis job, his wife deserts him, his daughter betrays<br />\nhim. Ironically, he becomes one of the hunted, constantly watched and threatened, ultimately limited<br />\nin his ability to take action. In his desire to understand South African blacks, Ben lives his final days<br />\nmuch like them.<br />\nThe irony of Ben's situation isn't realized until<br />\nthe final moments. \"A Dry White Season\"<br />\ncrescendoes swiftly, ending with a tidy, crowdpleasing blur of retribution. But this one act, based<br />\non a compulsion by one individual, hardly ends<br />\nthe film on a note of equilibrium. The film is fic-<br />\n<br />\ntion, which is also misleading, since the reality<br />\nis probably much worse. Most troubling of all is<br />\nthat \"A Dry White Season\" was set in 1976,<br />\nmeaning that for 13 years the cycle of horror<br />\npainstakingly recreated here has been repeated in<br />\nSouth Africa.<br />\n<br />\nA DRY WHITE SEASON<br />\nA Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Release<br />\nDirected by Euzhan Palcy<br />\nWritten by Colin Welland and Euzhan Palcy<br />\nBased on the novel by Andre Brink<br />\nProduced by Paula Weinstein<br />\nExecutive Producer Tim Hampton<br />\nDirectors of Photography Kelvin Pike, B.S.C.,<br />\nand Pierre William Glenn<br />\nProduction Designed by John Fenner<br />\nEdited by Sam O'Steen and Glenn Cunningham<br />\nCasting by Mary Selway<br />\nMusic by Dave Grusin<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nMO<br />\n<br />\nVIES<br />\n<br />\n'Fabulous Baker Boys' Go<br />\nNoplace without their Singer<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nIn Steve Kloves' promising but<br />\nuneven \"The Fabulous Baker<br />\nBoys,\" Frank and Jack Baker<br />\n(Beau and Jeff Bridges) tell corny jokes, play forgettable songs,<br />\nand slightly entertain apathetic<br />\nnightclub crowds. They're lounge<br />\nlizards from hell, a piano act as<br />\nlovable as stale cigarette smoke.<br />\nAt one point, Jack suggests a<br />\ncall to the Sheraton, based on a<br />\ntip that their harpist has appendicitis. We can sense a pattern<br />\nhere: this duo has been at it a long<br />\ntime, small clubs and low expectations. It's a mundane and<br />\ninauspicious introduction. But<br />\nwhen a gorgeous singer spices up<br />\ntheir act, \"The Fabulous Baker<br />\nBoys\" make beautiful music.<br />\nLike the Baker Boys themselves,<br />\nthe film succeeds when it gets the<br />\nact together. Otherwise it's strictly cocktail peanuts.<br />\nFrank is the business end of the<br />\nrelationship, less talented artistically than Jack, but more<br />\nastute financially. Frank realizes<br />\na change in the act is necessary,<br />\nafter fifteen years, to stay competitive and solvent. At the end<br />\nof a bruising montage of auditions, (\"there was a certain surreal quality to it,\" Frank admits)<br />\nSusie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) arrives.<br />\nDiamond is an hour and a half<br />\nlate, chews gum violently, and,<br />\nas entertainment experience, offers her work for an escort service.

She joins the act<br />\nlooking proudly out of place, and<br />\nglides on stage like she may have<br />\ncopped some moves from a slowmotion tape of Ax! Rose. But<br />\nSusie's a pro, and she adjusts,<br />\neven to singing \"Feelings.\"<br />\n\"The Fabulous Baker Boys,\"<br />\nquite simply, skyrockets to<br />\nanother plane when Michelle<br />\nPfeiffer enters the film. And on<br />\nwave after wave she carries us:<br />\nher songs, her wit and cockiness.<br />\nEven standing still she makes the<br />\nearth move. Pfeiffer is completely mesmerizing; arguably, she's<br />\nthe sexiest and most beautiful film<br />\nactress ever. One must only see<br />\nher scorching rendition of\"Making Whoopee\" to believe.<br />\nBut the depth Pfeiffer brings to<br />\nher performance is independent<br />\nof these physical attributes. When<br />\nDiamond is onstage she's a different person, perhaps the real<br />\nperson, in touch with her core.<br />\nNot overly theatrical, just incredibly honest. And in the inevitable entanglement with Jack,<br />\nDiamond's on such a slow boil<br />\nthat you may want to check if the<br />\nburner's on.<br />\nFirst-time director Kloves<br />\nmakes no mistake with Pfeiffer:<br />\nthe camera worships her as we<br />\n<br />\ndo. Where Kloves errs is as a<br />\nscreenwriter: inevitably this trio<br />\ndwindles to a duet (Susie leaves<br />\nto sing commercial jingles), and<br />\nfinally to only one. Unfortunately, that one is Jack, the least interesting character, who is badly<br />\nunderwritten early in the film.<br />\nHe's the brooding Baker Boy,<br />\nand no one cares about Jack moping about missed opportunities.<br />\nWe want Susie!<br />\nAs Jack ponders life after the<br />\nBaker Boys, we wonder about<br />\nwhere Susie is, and what she's<br />\ndoing. Besides, she was the<br />\ncharacter who always had the<br />\nability to set everyone straight.<br />\nWhere is she when we need her?<br />\nAll we can do is yearn for her<br />\nreturn, and when she finally arrives, her stay is painfully short.<br />\nDiamond's absence also accentuates the poor development of<br />\nthe relationship between the two<br />\nBaker brothers. The two Bridges<br />\nshould have a lifetime of<br />\nmaterial, but after thirty-one<br />\nyears of playing piano together,<br />\nthe Baker Boys have shamefully<br />\nlittle to say to each other.<br />\nSusie would have something to<br />\nsay, though.

(The athlete<br />\nwho drinks during a game needs<br />\nmore help and direction than this<br />\narticle can provide.)<br />\nOne sportsman's myth is that<br />\na mug of beer or glass of wine<br />\nbefore competition helps calm the<br />\nnerves, and can thus lead to a better performance. While a small<br />\namount of alcohol may induce<br />\ncalmness, that same small amount<br />\ncan lead to reduced coordination,<br />\ndepression, and anxiety. Gabe<br />\nMirkin, doctor in the sportsmedicine department at the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, says,<br />\n\"Alcohol depresses the activity of<br />\nyour central nervous system,<br />\nmaking you slower, and dulling<br />\nyour thought processes.\" Pregame drinking is also risky<br />\nbecause it can lead the athlete to<br />\nbelieve his or her success resides<br />\nin beer rather than within himself<br />\nor herself; once an athlete<br />\nestablishes a routine that is<br />\ncredited with his or her success,<br />\nthe pattern is hard to break.<br />\nInstances of drinking before a<br />\ngame are rare compared to postgame beer consumption. The<br />\nfitness rationale has been that<br />\nbeer contains the natural elements<br />\nthat the body needs after a serious<br />\nworkout. Some athletes use this<br />\nargument to justify excessive<br />\n<br />\nby Jeffrey Blitz<br />\n<br />\nDave Elkes (3), the Centennial Conference's top punter, in action against Ursinus.<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Calendar<br />\nFootball<br />\n<br />\nSaturday<br />\n<br />\nGEORGETOWN<br />\n<br />\nSoccer<br />\n<br />\nSaturday<br />\nTuesday<br />\n<br />\nFRANKLIN & MARSHALL 10:45 am<br />\nWIDENER<br />\n7:00 pm<br />\n<br />\nMen's Cross Country<br />\n<br />\nSaturday<br />\n<br />\nWASHINGTON COLLEGE<br />\n<br />\n2:00 pm<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Volleyball<br />\n<br />\nMonday<br />\n<br />\nMarymount at Notre Dame<br />\n<br />\n7:00 pm<br />\n<br />\n2:00 pm<br />\n<br />\nThere are times when the goals<br />\nof an athlete do not coincide with<br />\nthe goals of a fitness-conscious<br />\nperson. The image of the athlete<br />\npresented in ancient legend is one<br />\nof an extraordinary person. Today, though, the ambitions of<br />\nsome college athletes do not appear to include improved physical<br />\nsoundness. In that category of<br />\nathlete is the player who abuses<br />\nalcohol. Athletes and alcohol<br />\nhave a long history together; the<br />\nwisdom of that juxtaposition<br />\nneeds to be examined.<br />\nPeople have speculated that<br />\ncollege athletes and alcohol so<br />\nreadily go together because of<br />\noverconfidence on the part of the<br />\njock. On the court or field, these<br />\nathletes push their bodies to the<br />\nlimits and prove their resiliency.<br />\nOff the court, in a bar or at a party, these same people seek to<br />\nshow the toughness of their<br />\nbodies by guzzling beers or doing shots. In the early stages,<br />\nthese athletes can be misled into<br />\nbelieving that a one-day hangover<br />\nis the single result of alcohol<br />\nabuse. In fact, the harmfulness of<br />\nalcohol abuse to the athlete's performance should not be<br />\nunderestimated or belittled.<br />\nWhatever you think of drinking<br />\nand college students in general,<br />\nthere is no place for abuse of<br />\nalcohol in the lifestyle of the<br />\nserious athlete.<br />\n<br />\nFootball loses<br />\nFOOTBALL, from 16<br />\n<br />\nField Hockey<br />\n<br />\nToday<br />\nMonday<br />\n<br />\nSTUDEN<br />\n&FACULTY<br />\n<br />\nFARES<br />\n<br />\nat Georgetown<br />\n3:30 pm<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference Playoffs<br />\nFirst It'mind Game<br />\n<br />\nReplace Your Glasses With<br />\n<br />\nCONTACT LENSES<br />\nThere's a Contact Lens For You For Studying, Any Sports Activity or Just Looking Your Best.

Even<br />\nprofessional athletes are not exempt from this thinking. Butch<br />\nBuchholz, the commissioner for<br />\nWorld Team Tennis, has said,<br />\n\"Almost every tennis player in<br />\nthe world, both male and female,<br />\ndrinks a beer after a game. The<br />\nalcohol goes out in the urine and<br />\nthe athlete can play the next day<br />\nwith no side effects.\"<br />\nDespite this observation, drinking can be harmful to the athlete's<br />\nperformance. Getting the alcohol<br />\nout of your body does not perfectly remedy the situation; damage<br />\nis done while the alcohol is in<br />\nyour system, and your ability to<br />\nplay will be adversely affected.<br />\nRobert Haas, author of Eat to<br />\nWin, explained the truth about<br />\ndrinking after competition.<br />\n\"Alcohol is a dehydrating<br />\nsubstance. It blocks the release of<br />\nthe anti-diuretic hormone(ADH)<br />\nwhich helps to regulate the<br />\namount of water lost in the urine.<br />\nThe less ADH released by the<br />\npituitary gland, the more water<br />\nlost. And...along with that water<br />\ngo important minerals that<br />\nmuscles require for peak<br />\nperformance.\"<br />\nThe case against drinking is<br />\nmade stronger still when Haas<br />\nwrites that \"alcohol also destroys<br />\nvitamins (especially thiamine and<br />\nvitamin B-1, a key factor in<br />\nenergy metabolism) and has a<br />\ndirect, toxic effect on many<br />\norgans, including the liver and<br />\nkidneys.\"<br />\nThe myth of the college jock is<br />\nthat he is so physically fit that<br />\nalmost nothing can harm him.<br />\nThe nature of alcohol abuse is<br />\nsuch that you can be fooled into<br />\nthinking no harm has come\u2014you<br />\ndo feel normal a day or two<br />\nlater\u2014when in fact athletic performance, not to mention overall<br />\nhealth, is drastically affected.

Iwai had<br />\nskipped tennis last year to concentrate on academies.<br />\nThe addition of Braude, a<br />\npower-oriented player from New<br />\nJersey, could also improve the<br />\nteam, which only lost one player<br />\nto graduation (Jon Holzman). The<br />\nstriking improvement of Sam<br />\nKim, who practiced daily over<br />\nthe summer and developed a<br />\ncannon-like first serve, should<br />\nalso help. Tony Sangchompuphen, a sophomore who missed almost every match last year<br />\ndue to laboratory requirements<br />\n(not an uncommon problem for<br />\nthe Hopkins tennis team), also<br />\nplayed extensively over the summer and may be a major contributor to this year's squad.<br />\nAll these factors have added a<br />\ngreat deal of depth, which is<br />\ncrucial when each regular season<br />\nmatch consists of six singles matches and three doubles matches.<br />\n\"We feel confident that we'll get<br />\nvictories in the fourth, fifth, and<br />\n<br />\nsixth singles slots, because the<br />\nguys who will be playing there<br />\nare on the same level as most<br />\nother teams' one through three<br />\n[singles] players.\" Ironically,<br />\ncoach Bill Nelson is faced with<br />\nthe opposite problem from last<br />\nyear, when he often had to work<br />\nto scrounge up enough players to<br />\nconstitute a full squad. This year,<br />\nhe will have to pick only six<br />\nplayers when there are at least<br />\nseven potential starters.<br />\nNelson is also optimistic about<br />\nthe team. \"With the addition of<br />\nseveral fine freshmen prospects<br />\nand the return of Ryu lwai, and<br />\nthe fact that we're returning<br />\neveryone but Jon Holzman, I<br />\nthink the prospects are good for<br />\na successful spring season,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"I think there's going to be a<br />\nbig, big turnaround [from last<br />\nyear],\" said lwai. \"A lot of that<br />\nis due to new players and a better overall attitude on the team.\"<br />\nlwai went on to predict the team<br />\nwould finish \"way over .500\"<br />\nand thus eclipse the percent improvement mark posted by the<br />\nOrioles this season. Another factor which may contribute to the<br />\nBlue Jays' expected resurgence is<br />\ntheir increased experience. lwai<br />\nis the only senior, but the bulk of<br />\nthe team, Engquist, Missner,<br />\nRoth, Kim, and Sangehompuphen, started many matches<br />\nlast year.<br />\n<br />\nCHOICE VISA LACROSSE CLASSIC<br />\nat University ofMaryland-Baltimore County<br />\nSaturday<br />\nUMBC vs. Towson St.<br />\nHopkins vs. Loyola<br />\nSunday<br />\nConsolation Game<br />\nChampionship Game<br />\n<br />\n12:00 noon<br />\n3:00 pm<br />\n12:00 noon<br />\n3:00 pm<br />\n<br />\nBIA Notes<br />\nby J.F. Guest<br />\nWith the road race, singles tennis, and powder puff this past<br />\nweekend, BIA action was at an<br />\nall-time high. It's really surprising how many people think getting up at 10 a.m. on a Sunday<br />\nmorning in order to bring pain<br />\nupon yourself is a good idea.<br />\nNonetheless, many outstanding<br />\nperformances were turned in by<br />\nthese highly dedicated athletes. In<br />\nthe fraternity division, Sig Ep<br />\nproved tough taking first (John<br />\nMunnich) and fourth, second<br />\nplace went to DU (Todd \"not<br />\nnew guy\" Murray), with Kappa Sig taking third. In the independents, the Earth Science<br />\nteam dominated, capturing first<br />\n(Mike \"Michael\" Stevens) and<br />\nthird, Alpha Phi Alpha took second, the CSA fourth. In the<br />\ndorms Eric Steidinger of VincentWillard proved too marathonic<br />\nfor the rest of the crowd as he<br />\nroared through the 2.2 miles in<br />\n3:58.75 (Swiss timing) shattering<br />\nEubikye Nubindar's world record<br />\nfor the Homewood Run by over<br />\n7 minutes. Second place went to<br />\nChris \"Grieco\" Conlan of<br />\nWood, with Vincent-Willard taking third and fourth.<br />\nThis past weekend also<br />\nfeatured the singles tennis tournament. In the fraternity division,<br />\nDave \"Shoe\" Boxenbaum finished first for FIJI, followed by Phi<br />\nPsi, ZBT, and DU. In the independents, Jay Garg captured<br />\nthe crown with a time of 8:45.32.<br />\nThe dorms finished as follows:<br />\nWilson, Wood, Jennings,<br />\nHollander. In the women's division Mike! Nikkelle destroyed all<br />\nthe competition in the independents, winning for the<br />\n<br />\nBSU. In the dorms Clark took<br />\nfirst followed by Vincent-Willard<br />\nand McCoy.<br />\nPowder puff football also<br />\nwound down this weekend after<br />\na grueling two-month season. In<br />\nthe sororities, Alphi Phi blanked<br />\nPhi Mu 13 to 0. The dorms<br />\nfeatured Royce dominating<br />\nMcCoy 26 to 0. Royce also<br />\nfeatured Kenya (she doesn't have<br />\na last name) who apparently<br />\nsingle-handedly accounted for all<br />\nof the points.<br />\nJust because your parents<br />\naren't coming doesn't mean that<br />\nBIA action stops. This weekend<br />\nthe legendary fall lacrosse tournament takes place, check the<br />\ncage for the pairings or call Tony<br />\n\"girly secretary man\" Park<br />\n(889-3021). Furthermore, next<br />\nweek flag football holds playoffs<br />\nso make all checks payable to<br />\nVinny Alfi because there's no<br />\nMuch thing as a free lunch in the<br />\nBIA.

I<br />\nhave a sinking feeling in my gut that Trek Gurus also keep<br />\nbaseball stats. The two most incorrectly answered questions<br />\nwere the one regarding the winning pitcher of a game & the<br />\ntop players in history. Rule 10.19(c), paragraph 1 & 4 states<br />\nthat the most effective pitcher, as determined by the official<br />\nscorer is credited with the win. It seems that everybody just<br />\nguessed as to the identities of the 10 top offensive players,<br />\nwhere it should have been just another bit o'trivia for baseball<br />\nnumber crunchers. The list was based on the number of<br />\nrecords each player set during his career & the number of<br />\nrecords that still stand today. Simple. (Henry Aaron was<br />\nnumber II. by the way).

In fact,<br />\nwriting-intensive courses already<br />\nexist throughout the schools of<br />\nArts and Sciences and Engineering, which, under the proposal,<br />\nwould be labeled 'W' in thc<br />\ncourse catalogue. The 'W'<br />\ndesignator would be in addition<br />\nto the current 'H,\"5,\"N \"Q,'<br />\nand 'E' area designators for<br />\ncourses. Two'W'courses would<br />\nbe required for a Bachelor of<br />\nScience degree and four for a<br />\nBachelor of Arts degree.<br />\nThese requirements, if approved, will not be put into effect immediately, but will be phased in<br />\ngradually, to give departments<br />\ntime to provide an adequate<br />\nnumber of courses. The proposal<br />\nrequires the class of 1993 to take<br />\none 'W'course, the class of 1994<br />\ntwo courses, B.A. students<br /><br />\ngraduating in 1995 three courses,<br />\nand B.A. students in the 1996<br />\nclass and thereafter four courses.<br />\nAccording to the proposal, the<br />\n'W'courses would not only teach<br />\na particular subject but would also<br />\npay close attention to students'<br />\nwriting skills through multiple<br />\nwriting assignments. Students<br />\nwould be asked to revise and<br />\nrewrite these assignments.<br />\nThe CUS proposed that a<br />\nWriting Committee be created to<br />\nassist the departments in planning their offerings and to help the<br />\nindividual teacher to incorporate<br />\nthe writing program into his or<br />\nher course.<br />\nAssociate Dean for Academic<br />\nAdvising Martha Roseman, who<br />\nchairs the CUS,elaborated on the<br /><br />\nreasons for the writing proposal:<br />\n\"A general feeling was brought<br />\nto the CUS that students don't<br />\nwrite well, and Practical Composition and C.A.L. were not<br />\nanswering the question.

Critical<br />\nwriting shouldn't be a passive<br />\nlearning experience\u2014it should<br />\nhave more activity.<br />\nA member of the CUS<br />\nanswered the complaint, saying<br />\nthat \"in the long run the rewards<br />\nfor having a writing component<br />\nwill outweigh the work that all the<br />\nprofessors will get.\" Also speaking in defense of the proposal,<br />\nRoseman added, \"I advocate<br />\nanything that will make kids write<br />\nbetter.\"<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br /><br />\n.

It was agreed by the Council that one of the events, either<br />\nthe fair or the testing, would have<br />\nto be changed to accomodate the<br />\nother. Several suggestions arose<br />\nas possible solutions, but were<br />\nsoon ruled out.<br />\nMoving the Spring Fair to the<br />\nprevious weekend would cause an<br />\nundue overload on campus<br />\nfacilities because of the coinciding events of Homecoming<br />\nand Open House for accepted<br />\nstudents. Student Council president Lou Giangiulio cited overcrowding and minimized parking<br />\nareas as reasons not to schedule<br />\nthe fair for this date. Holding the<br />\nfair the weekend before<br />\nHomecoming would place the<br />\nevent during the major religious<br />\nholidays of Easter and Passover.<br />\nGiangiulio suggested that the<br />\nweekend of April 5 seemed to be<br />\nthe last possibility. While council members mentioned that the<br />\nfair has been that early in<br />\nprevious years, general sentiment<br />\nwas that the fair would run into<br />\nweather with cold<br />\nbad<br />\ntemperatures and rain or possibly<br />\nsnow.<br />\nIt was then suggested that a<br />\nsolution might be to relocate the<br />\nMCATs off campus during the<br />\nSpring Fair, although a site has<br />\nyet to be found. Giangiulio noted<br />\nthat a request for moving the<br />\nMCATs to the East Baltimore<br />\ncampus was rejected. He also<br />\nstated, however, that some<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community may feel that the MCATs<br />\ntake precedence over the Spring<br />\nFair, and that the fair, not the test,<br /><br />\nshould be moved. Other suggestions, such as moving the tests to<br />\nanother school in the Baltimore<br />\narea, were made. As of yet, no<br />\nfinal solution has been reached.<br />\nIn other business, the council<br />\nwas informed that the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies(CUS),<br />\na subcommittee of Academic<br />\nCouncil, has approved a proposal<br />\nto implement writing requirements starting with the Class<br />\nof 1994. The proposal, which has<br />\nnot yet passed in Academic<br />\nCouncil, calls for increased stress<br />\nin the area of writing skills.<br />\nIt has been noticed by several<br />\nof the faculty members that the<br />\nquality of writing of a majority of<br />\nHopkins students was lacking.<br />\nThis new program will stress<br />\n\"writing across the curriculum,\"<br />\na concept meaning that the student will learn to write better<br />\nthrough practical application of<br />\nwriting skills in courses<br />\nspecifically designated as writing<br />\nintensive.<br />\nTo receive a B.A., a student<br />\nwill be required to complete four<br />\ncourses with a heavy concentration of writing during his or her<br />\nacademic career. A B.S. candidate must complete two writing<br />\nintensive courses. The proposal<br />\ncalls for implementation to begin<br />\nwith requiring next year's<br />\nfreshman class to take one of the<br />\ndesignated courses during their<br />\nfour years. This requirement will<br />\nbe increased by one for each consecutive year until the four-course<br />\ngoal is reached.<br />\nThe Bookstore Committee of<br />\nthe council also presented new information.

Goldfinger<br />\nalso belongs to a program called<br />\nthe Discovery Center which, he<br />\nsays, \"investigates the possibility that the Torah may be based<br />\non provable facts, not just faith.\"<br />\nGoldfinger began his lecture by<br />\nreferring to Inherit the Wind, a<br />\nmovie made about the famous<br />\nScopes trial in Tennessee. He said<br />\nthat the famous trial of the<br />\nbiology teacher accused of promoting evolution in the 1920's\u2014<br />\nin which Clarence Darrow, the<br />\nlawyer for the defense, destroyed<br />\nthe Biblical arguments of William<br />\nJennings<br />\nBryan,<br />\nthe<br />\nprosecutor\u2014marked the ascendancy of science in public opinion<br />\nand the waning of the literal interpretation of the Bible.<br />\nGoldfinger then attempted to<br />\nprove his basic argument, which<br />\nwas that the Jewish traditionalist<br />\nview of Genesis and the view of<br />\nthe scientifically-minded person<br />\nwho knows of evolution and<br />\ncosmology need not be<br />\nincompatible.<br />\nTo do so, he introduced the<br />\nJewish Talmudic concept of the<br />\n`Kascha,' which literally means<br />\nan apparent contradiction in<br />\nscripture where the Talmudic<br />\nRabbis did not shy away from<br />\n`Kaschas,' but rather saw that it<br />\nmeant that the contradiction<br />\nseemed to exist only because their<br />\nview of the problem was incorrect and needed to be changeds<br />\nHe gave an example of the<br />\n`Kascha' in physics, referring to<br />\nthe problem of the wave-particle<br />\nduality of light, an apparent contradiction that was only solved by<br />\nthe advent of quantum<br />\nmechanics, in which the act of<br />\nobservation is taken into account.<br />\nGoldfinger said the apparent<br />\n`Kascha' between Genesis and<br />\nmodern scientific concepts need<br />\nnot indicate that either is incorrect, because the contradiction<br />\nmay only lie in an improper fundamental view of both.<br />\nGoldfinger raised the point that<br />\nGenesis contains two creation<br />\nstories, which seem at first to be<br />\ncontradictory. But he then Mentioned the Rabbinic viewpoint<br /><br />\nthat the Torah was written in conceptual order, not chronological,<br />\nand the argument of Rachi that<br />\nthe creation story was a<br />\nlegitimization of Israel and a<br />\nmoral instruction, not a rational<br />\ndescription. The two stories use<br />\ntwo different names for the<br />\ncreator\u2014' Elohim\" symbolizing<br />\nthe God ofjustice and natural and<br />\nmoral law, and \"Yhvh Elohim\"<br />\nin the second story symbolizing<br />\nthis being balanced by mercy and<br />\nkindness.<br />\nHe explained that the Rabbinic<br />\ninterpretation was that the first<br />\nstory dealt with the creation of<br />\nman as a physical being, and that<br />\nthe second story dealt with the<br />\ncreation of the spiritual or 'confronted' man. The first account<br />\ndescribes man as created 'through<br />\nthe forces of nature,' which he<br />\nsuggested could mean the evolutionary process of natural selection; and the second describes<br />\nman as being made from the dust<br />\nof the earth and being given the<br />\n'breath of life,' or the soul.<br />\nThe first account is the creation<br />\nof the world in seven days, after<br />\nthe \"chaotic emptiness\" where<br />\nthe spirit of the Lord moves over<br />\nthe face of the \"waters\" and<br />\ndeclares \"let there be light.\"<br />\nThe first 'day' is the separation<br />\nof light from darkness; the sun<br />\nand moon are only made on the<br />\nfourth 'day' to give men a calendar so they may keep the Sabbath<br />\nand other festivals; the animals<br />\nare made on the sixth 'day,'<br />\nculminating in the decision, \"Let<br />\nus make man in our image,\" in<br />\nwhich Goldfinger says the \"us\"<br />\nrefers to the angels or divine<br />\nforces without free will. The text,<br />\nhe notes, uses the word \"Adam\"<br />\nwhich is not masculine in Hebrew<br />\nbut neuter, and therefore according to the rabbis suggests a hermaphroditic being.<br />\nThe second account says man<br />\nwas raised from the \"dust of the<br />\nearth,\" which he said agrees with<br />\nthe evolutionary biologists today<br />\nwho feel that the redicing atmosphere necessary for the origin<br />\nof organic molecules existed only in clay. In this second account<br />\nthe hermaphrodite \"Adam\" is<br />\nshown all the animals to see<br />\nwhich would be his \"helpmate.\"<br />\nGoldfinger suggested that the<br />\nfact that Adam needed a mate<br />\neven as a hermaphrodite suggested that God meant marriage<br />\nto have more than a reproductive<br />\nfunction. Since all animals are<br />\nunsatisfactory, this \"Adam\" is<br />\nfissioned, and created from him<br />\nis \"Havvah,\" who is called the<br />\n\"Mother of the Living\" even<br />\nthough Adam receives no such<br /><br />\nexalted title.<br />\nGoldfinger went on to talk<br />\nabout the modern scientific theory<br />\nof the origin of the universe. He<br />\nsaid that it began with a Big Bang<br />\nin which space expanded like the<br />\nsurface of a balloon into<br />\nnothingness; but also noted that<br />\nthe point of the Big Bang had to<br />\nbe a 'singularity' where the laws<br />\nof physics did not apply and the<br />\nconcept of causation is<br />\nmeaningless.<br />\nHe said that the quantum field<br />\ntheory speaks of the 'physical<br />\nvacuum' as being filled with 'virtual particles' which are present<br />\nbut imperceptible\u2014much like the<br />\n'chaotic nothingness' of Genesis.<br />\nHe also said that quantum theory<br />\nsuggests particles are constantly<br />\nbeing destroyed and recreated<br />\nanew, which agrees with the<br />\nTorah viewpoint that God continually creates the universe. He<br />\nfurther noted that the temperature<br />\nof the initial Big Bang was so<br />\ngreat that no matter could exist,<br />\nonly radiation\u2014so 'light' was the<br />\nfirst thing to be created.<br />\nHis most complicated point<br />\nwas that physics suggests that the<br />\nfour forces of nature\u2014gravity,<br />\nelectromagnetism, strong nuclear<br />\nforce, and the weak force, which<br />\ncauses radioactivity\u2014all were<br />\ncreated from an original fundamental force through 'broken<br />\nsymmetry,' much like the Jewish<br />\nKabbalist conception of \"Tzimtzum\" or the contraction and concealing of God from the world to<br />\nallow people to have free will,<br />\nwhich suggests that the original<br />\nharmony of the universe was<br />\ndisrupted in the \"shattering of the<br />\nvessels.\"<br />\nMoving from cosmology to<br />\nbiology, Goldfinger noted that the<br />\nTalmud suggests that there were<br />\n974 generations of 'men' before<br />\nAdam who were without souls.<br />\nHe suggested that the Creation ex<br />\nnihilo(or creation out of nothing<br /><br />\nsaid to have taken place for man)<br />\nreferred to the soul given to this<br />\nsoulless hermaphrodite being.<br />\nGoldfinger spoke of the<br />\nbiologists who had traced the<br />\nmitochondrial DNA (which is<br />\npassed only through the mother,<br />\nnot through both parents) of<br />\nhumanity and discovered that<br />\nhomo sapiens might have a common ancestor, 'Eve,' who lived<br />\nin Africa some 200,000 years<br />\nago\u2014much as Genesis speaks of<br />\nthe \"Mother of all Living.\" He<br />\nsuggested that the Cro-Magnons<br />\ndescended from the 'Eve'<br />\neradicated the Neanderthals in<br />\nEurope, who were the \"preAdamites\" of Torah.<br />\nGoldfinger then went on to deal<br />\nwith his ultimate `Kascha,' which<br />\nwas reconciling the six days of<br />\nGenesis with the fifteen-billionyear-old universe. To deal with<br />\nthis, he referred to Einstein's<br />\ntheory of special relativity, which<br />\nsuggests that time is a relative<br />\nquantity and not absolute\u2014a day<br />\nfor a man traveling in a spaceship<br />\nnear the speed of light could be<br />\nyears for his brother stationary at<br />\nhome.<br />\nHe said that the contradiction<br />\ncould be resolved by understanding that fifteen billion years<br />\ncould relativistically be only six<br />\ndays for the Creator's reference<br />\nframe outside the virtual<br />\nspacetime of the world.<br />\nWhile Goldfinger managed to<br />\ncombine some esoteric physics<br />\nand biology with some equally<br />\nesoteric Talmudic and Kabbalistic<br />\nexegesis of the Torah to get the<br />\nBiblical Creation account to agree<br />\nwith the Big Bang evolutionary<br />\nmodel, many present were not<br />\ncompletely convinced. As a<br />\nresult, he suggested that they attend a Discovery Seminar which<br />\nwill be held in February 1990 to<br />\ndeal with some concepts which he<br />\ndid not cover, such as the<br />\nlegitimacy of the \"oral Torah.\"<br /><br />\nCampus Crime<br />\nComplainant reported that between October 17, 1989 and<br />\nOctober 18, 1989 some person(s) unknown removed from<br />\nthe lobby of McCoy Hall one<br />\n(1) sofa valued at $200.00.<br />\nComplainant reports he placed his personal property in a<br />\ndaily use locker at the Athletic<br />\nCenter while using the pool.<br />\nSometime on October 13, person(s) unknown forced open<br />\nthe locker door and removed<br />\nhis gents wallet containing personal papers and $35.00<br /><br />\nComplainant reports that<br />\nsometime on October 13, 1989<br />\nperson(s) unknown removed<br />\nan AT&amp;T telephone from a<br />\ndesk top in Merryman Hall.<br />\nValue of phone was placed at<br />\n$440.00.<br />\nComplainant reported that between October 18, 1989 and<br />\nOctober 19, 1989 some person(s) unknown removed from<br />\na laundry room in McCoy Hall<br />\na quantity of clothing valued at<br />\n$75.00.<br /><br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak \u2022International Experts\u2022Tour Packages\u2022Cruises\u2022Free V.I.P.

Our minds set<br />\nup an attitude for us with which<br />\nwe view the world, and eventually, the way we think and act is<br />\nreflected in the things we experience. An extension of the \"be<br />\ncareful what you wish for, for<br />\nyou shall surely get it\" mentality. I understand that. I guess that<br />\nmy thinking must be very circular<br />\nand self-enveloping, is all. Let me<br />\nexplain:<br />\nWhen I was in high school, for<br />\na time I was known for my quick<br />\nrecovery periods after being jilted<br />\nby the girls I dated (largely due<br />\nto the fact that so many in the row<br />\nbroke up with me). In fact, more<br />\nthan once a young lady, in ending<br />\na particular relationship with me,<br />\ntold me how to get in touch with<br />\nsomeone else in whom I might be<br />\ninterested.<br />\nNow, the first time a girl broke<br />\nup with me, like any Catholicraised child, I assumed that I haA<br />\ndone something wrong. I assumed that in some way, I had made<br />\nthe relationship fail; I was not<br />\nmeeting the needs of my steady.<br />\nI tried harder. I made the girls<br />\nI dated the subjects of my utmost<br />\nattention. So much so that I forgot<br />\nthe reason why I started, and it<br />\njust became a staple with me to<br />\nobsess about women.<br />\nBut they still kept jilting me.<br />\nHere I noticed a pattern in my<br />\nlife, the circle of history repeating<br />\nitself. That was when I realized<br />\nthat deja vu isn't a real<br />\nphenomenon; deja vu doesn't<br />\nmean you've been there before,<br />\nit's usually means you've just<br />\nseen it coming.<br />\nAround my eleventh relation:ship, I decided I should ask what<br />\nI was doing wrong. Obviously<br />\nmy focus was somewhat skewed.<br />\n\"Well, Chris, I just think<br />\nyou're a little too intense for me.<br />\nI think you're more serious than<br />\nI want to be.\"<br />\n\"Well, what can I do to prove<br /><br />\nGiven the News-Letter's role as the student-run newspaper,<br />\nwe might be forgiven for a bias in favor of things literary.<br />\nNevertheless, the Committee of Undergraduate Studies'<br />\nproposal to require writing credits for all undergraduates<br />\nis an excellent one. Accurate communication, whether<br />\nthrough newspapers, journals, letters and even computer<br />\nscreens is vital for the successful exchange of news, information, and most importantly, ideas.<br />\nThe CUS proposal, if passed by the Academic Council, would affect both the School of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nthe G. W. C. Whiting School of Engineering.

The GRO had originally asked<br />\nfor a breakdown of how the<br />\nmoney was to be spent. On Oct.<br />\n11, this was provided, and the<br />\ncouncil unanimously agreed to<br />\ngrant $300 from its Grad Support<br />\nbudget.<br />\nInternational Indoor Soccer<br />\nClub, an off-campus soccer team<br />\ncomposed partly of Hopkins grad<br />\nstudents, asked for a discretionary<br />\namount to be granted by the GRO<br />\nto help fund publicity. The GRO<br />\nsteering committee recommended that no funding be granted, as<br />\nthe team was not campus-oriented<br />\nenough. The council disagreed,<br />\nhowever, voting to table the motion until team spokesman Robert<br />\nHiggins could find out more<br />\nabout alternative funding and/or<br />\nhow the undergrad soccer club is<br />\norganized.

The GRO's total Grad<br />\nSupport budget being rather less<br />\nthan the whole amount requested<br />\nby the UJGS, it was obviously<br />\nimpossible to comply with the<br />\nlecture series or the purchase of<br />\nthe Talmud, since it is a religious<br />\nmatter, not a cultural one, and is<br />\ntherefore out of the GRO's constitutional purview. Further, as<br />\nthe UJGS had not approached<br />\nother funding sources, the council decided to fund only a portion<br />\nof the total that the group might<br />\npotentially raise by approaching<br />\nother Hopkins sources.

According to<br />\nthe editorial, fraternities, all<br />\nfraternities, function out of a<br />\n\"perverted sense of loyalty,\" are<br />\n\"pervasive...1in] fostering<br />\nsubstance abuse,\" and threaten<br />\nthe rest of an \"intellectually<br />\nvibrant campus...at the roots.\"<br />\nI have two interpretations of<br />\nthis editorial, and neither is flattering to the News-Letter. The<br />\nfirst is that the News-Letter staff<br />\nbelieve that they and the rest of<br />\nthe Hopkins community walk<br />\naround in fear of anyone wearing<br />\nfraternity letters. The NewsLetter is essentially comparing<br />\nHopkins students (engineers,<br />\nwriting majors, pre-meds, etc.)<br />\nwho wear Greek Letters to gangs<br />\nof thugs who wear colors. This<br />\nis preposterous.<br />\nMy second interpretation is that<br />\nthe editorialist let his article and<br />\nhis language get out of control,<br />\nas is evidenced by the above<br />\nquotations. In either case<br />\napologies are due. The NewsLetter is promoting Greek<br />\nbashing.<br />\nAs President of DU, I don't<br />\nwant to News-Letter bash.<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes letters to<br />\nthe editors.

In an attempt to promote<br />\na better Hopkins community,<br />\nthey are instead only exacerbating<br />\nsituations.<br />\nIn my three years at JHU the<br />\nonly publicity afforded DU has<br />\nbeen negative. In fact, the vast<br />\nmajority of News-Letter the conwritten on or about the fraternity<br />\nsystem have been negative.<br />\nMyself and the officers of my<br />\nfraternity would be more than<br />\nhappy to sit down and discuss<br />\nwith the News-Letter the contributions we have made to both<br />\nthe Hopkins and Baltimore<br />\ncommunities.<br />\nI feel pleased to sign this letter<br />\nin response to an unsigned<br />\neditorial, and challenge the<br />\nNews-Letter to work with the<br />\nGreek system, instead of harassing<br />\nit<br />\nunfounded<br />\nwith<br />\naccusations.<br />\nJason T. Levine<br />\nPresident, Delta Upsilon<br />\nFraternity<br /><br />\non the fraternity system, and suggests that the University should<br />\n\"take steps to phase out the<br />\nGreek system.\" This kind of action would be foolhardy, placing<br />\nan even larger barrier between the<br />\nstudents and the University.<br />\nThe function of a fraternity/sorority goes far beyond being<br />\njust a party-holding institution.<br />\nThey are not drinking clubs, and<br />\nany chapter whose main function<br />\nis merely to hold parties will<br />\nassuredly be disbanded. Every<br />\nGreek organization has zerotolerance for any substance<br />\nabuse, and is thus held accountable for its actions not only by<br />\nthe administration, but by interested parties at both a national<br />\nand local level. On the positive<br />\nside, Greeks provide students<br />\nwith the opportunity to work<br />\ntogether as a unit to achieve goals<br />\nwhich will benefit themselves, the<br />\ncommunity, and the University.<br />\nMany examples of this kind of<br />\ngroup effort can be witnessed<br />\neach year, such as the Phi Psi<br />\n500, ATO's initiation of<br />\nMaryland's Governor Schaefer,<br />\nEditors' Note: the N-L quota- and the many coordinated comtions, in context, read, \"While munity service projects underthe majority offraternity members taken by every fraternity and<br />\nare undoubtedly sufficiently sorority.<br />\nmature and confident in the value<br />\nSubstance abuse is a nationoftheir institutions to allow such wide problem not to be easily and<br />\na letter to stand, without feeling carelessly blamed on the fratercompelled to respond with in- nal system.

The letter in last<br />\nweek's issue, while it places the<br />\nblame of the problem on some of<br />\nthe correct sources, emphasizes<br />\nthe wrong reasons for doing so<br />\nand the wrong way to deal with it.<br />\nThe author of the letter claims<br />\nthat \"the main focus of [Greek]<br />\n'parties' is alcohol and drugs\"<br />\nand that \"serious steps against<br />\nsubstance abuse in the community<br />\nshould start by taking steps to<br />\nphase out the Greek system.\"<br />\nThat many parties display large<br />\namounts of alcohol is true and<br />\nvery disturbing. However, the<br />\nproper remedy for this situation<br />\nshould not be the dismantling of<br />\nthe Greek system, but rather a<br /><br />\ngreater awareness of responsibility within it. Most fraternities<br />\nserve alternate beverages at parties, as well as provide escorts to<br />\nensure that guests return home<br />\nsafely. What is not done is the<br />\nproper advertising of these facts.<br />\nSigns should be prominently<br />\nposted to alert guests as to the<br />\nchoice of non-alcoholic beverages<br />\nand escorts should be clearly<br />\ndistinguished by tags or vests. It<br />\nis also the fraternity or sorority's<br />\nresponsibility to know when to<br />\nrefuse to serve guests who have<br />\nobviously drunk too much.<br />\nAnother responsibility of<br />\nGreek organizations is to seek<br />\nalternative social events. Fraternity and sorority parties are the<br /><br />\nmost visible actions of the Greek<br />\nsystem, but they need not all be<br />\nwet. An example of a nonalcoholic social event was the dry<br />\nparty held yesterday in the Terrace Room by Kappa Sigma and<br />\nResidential Life in support of<br />\nAlcohol Awareness Week.<br />\nSimilar events should be planned and executed by other Greek<br />\norganizations on campus.<br />\nPerhaps the largest fault,<br />\nhowever, lies with the entire student body. While the Greeks<br />\nmight hold the parties, there is<br />\na large number of non-Greeks<br />\nwho attend them. It is quite an obvious fact that these guests often<br />\nSee Letters, 9<br /><br />\nPunchline<br />\nPunch, from 6<br />\nyou draw, the inside of the picture is always indistinguishable<br />\nfrom the outside, and the first line<br />\nyou draw always ends up being<br />\nthe last one.

Unfortunately,<br />\nspace limitations allow me to<br />\nmerely point out a few of the<br />\nmore glaring difficulties.<br />\n1) Officer Reiss states that \"the<br />\ncrack wave hasn't really hit<br />\nBaltimore yet,\" even though<br />\nSpin magazine ran an article four<br />\nyears ago on crack and Baltimore<br />\nas one of its points of origin.<br />\nHere, as throughout the article,<br />\nMr. Varon is relying on the<br />\npossibly biased and unreliable information given by one or two<br />\nsources, instead of conducting the<br />\npersonal research and analysis<br />\nthat is essential to accurate<br />\nreporting.<br />\n2) What precisely are \"hard<br />\ndrugs\"? Mr. Varon uses this<br />\nterm several times without ever<br />\ndefining it. Officer Larkin states<br />\nthat no one has ever been taken<br />\nto Union Memorial for OD'ing<br />\non hard drugs, which must mean<br />\nthat they OD'ed on marijuana or<br />\nalcohol. It is impossible,<br />\nhowever, to OD on marijuana.<br />\nAre we to believe then that<br />\nalcohol, which can very easily<br /><br />\nkill you, is not a hard drug? Furthermore, how can 'shrooms,<br />\nwhich are physically nonaddictive, have no lasting<br />\nphysical effects, and which, to<br />\nmy knowledge, have never killed anyone, even be mentioned in<br />\nthe same breath with cocaine as<br />\na \"hard drug?\" These<br />\nstatements, like so much of Mr.<br />\nVaron's article, seem to be based<br />\non the subjective opinions and<br />\nexperiences of Mr. Varon and his<br />\nlimited sources, and have no<br />\nplace in serious journalism.<br />\nIn general, Mr. Varon's article<br />\nreminds me of an old Doonesbury<br />\ncartoon, in which Zonker convinces reporter Roland Hedley<br />\nthat a lilac bush is a marijuana<br />\nplant. Mr. Varon, like Roland,<br />\nseems to have neither the experience or wisdom to find the<br />\nreal facts, or the ability to report<br />\nthem in an accurate, unbiased<br />\nmanner.<br />\nPhil Gochenour<br />\nClass of '89<br /><br />\nRosen I<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs President of the Gay and<br />\nLesbian Alliance I would like to<br />\nthank James Rosen for<br />\nacknowledging the existence of<br />\nour group. Reading his strip I can<br />\ntell James must regularly attend<br />\nour meetings in order to have<br />\nsuch an accurate description of<br />\nwhat occurs at them.<br />\nIt isn't every day that the NewsLetter addresses anything GALA<br />\nrepresents or does. Even being<br />\nfeatured in \"With Eyes Closed\"<br />\nseems like such a triumph. Why<br />\nshould the News-Letter waste<br />\nvaluable column space discussing<br />\nhow our weekly posters are torn<br />\ndown from campus bulletin<br />\nboards almost as fast as they are<br />\nput up'? Why lose ink addressing<br />\nthe fact that not too long ago an<br />\nundergraduate committed suicide<br />\npartly due to his inability, while<br />\nliving at Hopkins, to deal with his<br /><br />\nown sexual orientation? Why<br />\nmisuse precious paper explaining<br />\nthat the black boxes over the faces<br />\nof Rosen's characters are a reality<br />\nat Hopkins and not a joke? But,<br />\nI'm digressing from what I<br />\nwanted to be a laudatory tone.<br />\nWhy should anyone expect the<br />\nNews-Letter to address a reality<br />\nwhen lampooning is so much<br />\nmore fun? Thank you James and<br />\nI hope that you remember our little group in the future.<br />\nI sympathize with the NewsLetter's policy not to print<br />\nanonymous letters to the editor.<br />\nI'm sure that already bending this<br />\nrule twice this year has been a difficult decision. My situation,<br />\nhowever, requires ;ne to request<br />\nthat the News-Letier bend the<br />\nrules once again. In the past,<br />\nmembers of GALA who have<br />\nallowed their identities to be<br />\npublicly known have been met<br />\nwith threats and in short have had<br />\ntheir lives made difficult in<br />\nseveral ways. On the other hand,<br />\nanyone who wishes to know me<br />\nor respond to me in person could<br />\neasily find me at any meeting of<br />\nGALA. I think requesting<br />\nanonymity demonstrates even<br />\nfurther the real prejudices on this<br />\ncampus which pats itself on the<br />\nback for its intellectual greatness<br />\nwith one hand and covers up its<br />\nsometimes vicious intolerance<br />\nwith the other.<br />\nOh, and by the way, at our last<br />\nmeeting we were discussing your<br />\nreference to Kenny Rogers and<br />\njackboots. Pardon our ignorance,<br />\nJames, but we have no idea what<br />\nyou are talking about. Perhaps<br />\nyou're into some leather and<br />\nchains scene or something, but<br />\nthat's far too radical for our conservative tastes. Maybe you could<br />\nclarify some of that stuff in your<br />\nnext strip.

Such incidents,<br />\nhowever, are rare and are considered unacceptable by virtually all members of the Hopkins'<br />\ncommunity. Far more insidious,<br />\nthough less newsworthy, are the<br />\ncommonplace actions which reinforce bigotry in our society. You<br />\nurged us all to \"reevaluate our<br />\nbehavior and feelings towards<br />\nthose who may not belong to our<br />\nown private corner of Hopkins<br />\nand the world in general.\" Yet,<br />\non the following page you chose<br />\nto publish a cartoon which was<br />\noffensive and degrading to one<br />\nparticular<br />\nHopkins' and<br />\nworldwide population.

For<br />\nsome reason, in the last couple of<br />\nyears this popularity dwindled to<br />\na level which made it very hard<br />\nto continue operations. At the<br />\nbeginning of this year, the new<br />\nmanagers and bartenders were<br />\ncharged with one task: turn the<br /><br />\nplace around.<br />\nThis has not been an easy task.<br />\nDespite a lot of extra work by the<br />\nstaff in improvements to the<br />\nmenu, a host of promotional activities, and an attitude which<br />\ndisplays real concern for the success of the Grad Club, admittedly the crowds(and the profit) are<br />\nyet in-coming.<br />\nThere has always been talk on<br />\ncampus about a lack of concern<br />\nfrom the administration about the<br />\nquality of student life here at<br />\nHopkins. While this may be true<br />\nto some extent, the state of the<br />\nGrad Club for the past few years<br />\nseems to indicate that students<br />\nhave not cared themselves. It is<br />\nhard to believe that students<br />\nwould not seek out a place such<br />\nas the Grad Club, since it's<br />\ncheaper than the other alternatives<br />\nin the neighborhood and designed for the exclusive use of<br />\nHopkins students and their<br />\nguests. The Club should be packed every night.<br />\nTo all students, especially the<br />\ngraduate students, I am encouraging your return to the Grad Club.<br />\nWhy? First, the Grad Club has an<br />\natmosphere conducive to socializing and/or group study. Tuesday<br />\nand Wednesday are traditionally<br />\nquiet nights at the Club, making<br />\nit a great alternative place to relax<br />\nwhile cramming for tests at the<br />\nsame time. Second, the food is<br />\ngreat and the beer is cheap. I<br />\nchallenge CVP or Pr s to consistently offer draft beer for 75<br />\ncents or pizza at three bucks.<br />\nThird, programming. Almost<br />\nevery night of the week<br />\nsomething unique to the<br />\nHomewood area is planned.<br />\nTuesdays are free movies and<br />\nmunchies. Thursdays offer the<br />\ndancing which students lost when<br />\nthe RATT died out. Fridays offer<br />\nsome of the top local rock and<br />\njazz talent, and every Saturday<br />\nhas free live music. Other<br />\nneighborhood bars simply don't<br />\noffer these things. Plus, pinball<br />\nmachines, darts, a jukebox, and<br />\nT.V. like the other places. Final-<br /><br />\nly, it's convenient. There's no<br />\nneed to drive downtown or to<br />\nFells Point every time you want<br />\nto go out!<br />\nOnly the support of the<br />\nHopkins students can keep the<br />\nGrad Club running.

Finally,<br />\nJohn was able to fully express his<br />\nmusical talents.<br />\nWhile at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, Tennyson has been a<br />\nregular contestant in the annual<br />\nMusical Showcase Talent Show,<br />\nwhich he won two years ago.<br />\nDecember 7th of last year also<br />\nmarked his first solo multimedia<br />\nconcert, FUNK YOU.<br />\nNot only is John Tennyson a<br />\nman of music and psychology, he<br />\nis also a man of philosophy and<br />\nmeaning. For example, Tennyson<br />\nplayed in the Hopkins Electronic<br />\nLive Saving Project (HELP)<br />\nsponsored by the Synth Club, in<br />\nwhich all the proceeds were<br />\ndonated to the Hopkins AIDS<br />\nInstitute.<br />\nWhen asked what makes him<br />\nsuch an interesting person, Tennyson chuckles and makes a statement of not wanting to sound<br />\ncondescending.<br /><br />\n\"I try to be open-minded and<br />\ntie that into my music. I like to<br />\naddress issues that people tend to<br />\nignore. My music isn't so much<br />\nabout social issues, but more<br />\nabout philosophical truths.\"<br />\nFor instance, in his song titled<br />\n\"Hate,\" he talks about yin-yang<br />\nand the nature of hate and love.<br />\nTo many people, the lyrics may<br />\nseem somewhat \"cynical\" and<br />\n\"make them feel uncomfortable,\" he says. But he tries to<br />\nspeak in simple language, such<br /><br />\nSpotlight<br />\nOn<br />\nA<br />\nHopkins<br />\nStudent<br />\nas: \"We all need something to<br />\nhate, hate means as much as<br />\nlove.\"<br />\nFrom academics to music, John<br />\nTennyson considers himself an<br />\nessentialist and an agnostic.<br />\nEntering Hopkins as a pre-med<br />\nmajoring in Behavioral Biology,<br />\nhe eventually found out that he<br />\ndidn't have the right personality<br />\nto do research.<br />\nTennyson says that the reason<br />\nthat he plays music is not for any<br />\nintellectual purposes. He does it<br /><br />\nfor the way it makes him feel.<br />\nTennyson's philosophy of life is<br />\nupbeat.<br />\n\"Do what makes you happy.<br />\nCollege is a place for discovery<br />\nfor me, even in the rat race of<br />\ncareers and jobs. Life is only so<br />\nlong. Do what you want to be<br />\nhappy. I've seen people that<br />\nhaven't thought about these things<br />\nand they may even hate their<br />\nclasses.\"<br />\nTennyson believes that people<br />\nneed to feel out their goals.<br />\n\"To me, variety is the very<br />\nspice of life. Sample and find the<br />\nthings that you may not think as<br />\npossible to do; explore the<br />\navenues. I'm going to work for<br />\nthe Freelance Production Company, because I feel that that is<br />\nsomething that will make me happy. I believe that I can succeed.<br />\nI either die or succeed, because<br />\nI want to live a full life.\"<br />\nJohn's past credits include the<br />\nscore for a fire prevention commercial for Francis Scott Key<br />\nMedical Center's Burn Unit on<br />\nMaryland Public Television and<br />\nbackground music for the Cincinnati Reds-Kansas City Royals<br />\nDream Week, in which fans got<br />\nto play old-timers.

The unusual building is<br />\nnoteworthy at quite a distance<br />\nwith its atypical architecture and<br />\ngrand profile. Set in the middle<br />\nof this building, between two<br />\nsmall shops housed at the sides,<br />\nis a large, forbidding door With<br />\na bright green welcome mat in<br />\nfront of it that boldly screams<br />\n\"The Professional Building.\"<br />\nBehind these doors, down the<br />\ncorridor, and up the stairs on the<br />\nfifth floor is the new headquarters<br />\nof Baltimore Living, one of the city's more valuable, if unknown,<br />\ngold mines of information.<br />\nBaltimore Living is, at its most<br />\nbasic level, an effort to promote<br />\nliving in downtown Baltimore.<br />\nThe service, sponsored by the City of Baltimore, was founded as<br />\na proactive marketing effort to<br />\nincrease the number of people living in the downtown area. It is a<br />\nfree, ready source of information<br />\non every aspect of the downtown<br />\narea\u2014be it housing opportunities<br />\nor lifestyle information.<br />\nWhatever type of information<br />\nyou need, including apartments,<br />\ntownhouses, condominiums, and<br />\nrentals, or the various amenities<br />\nthe city has to offer\u2014like sports<br />\nfacilities, shopping, and cultural<br />\nevents\u2014or whatever else you<br />\nneed to know about the city,<br />\nBaltimore Living is the place to<br /><br />\nturn.<br />\nIn the words of Bruce Lubart,<br />\nwho runs Baltimore Living, the<br />\nservice exists \"to compliment<br />\nother possible sources of information...not to compete with them.\"<br />\nIn addition to their own information, the service keeps tabs on<br />\nother sources. If someone contacts them, they can refer that<br />\nperson somewhere to have his<br />\nquestions answered.<br />\nIn the near future people may<br />\nhave even newer and better<br />\nsources of Baltimore Livingsponsored information as well:<br />\nthe service is currently planning<br />\na list of important phone numbers<br />\nfor people new to the city.<br />\nLikewise, the office eventually<br />\nhopes to put together some information comparing the cost of living in Baltimore with that of living in other cities.<br />\nOne of the many ways in which<br />\nBaltimore Living promotes the city is through outreach programs.<br />\nThe service has ties with several<br />\ncompanies and even some universities. For them Baltimore Living<br />\nis a resource: it helps sell the city to prospective employees or<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAll the company or college has<br />\nto do is get prospective<br />\nBaltimoreans there; Baltimore<br />\nLiving handles the rest. Similarly, the office gets many referals<br />\nfrom different businesses in the<br />\ncity.<br />\nPossibly the best\u2014and definitely the most important\u2014way in<br />\nwhich the service promotes the<br />\ncity is through direct communication. Either dropping by their<br />\noffice\u2014open from nine to five<br />\nMondays through Fridays,<br /><br />\nlocated at 330 North Charles (call<br />\nfirst)\u2014or by calling them at<br />\n685-LIVE, you can get the information you need.<br />\nAnother way in which<br />\nBaltimore Living promotes the city is a free program called \"Go<br />\nto Town,\" an introduction to the<br />\ndowntown area. This program is<br />\nscheduled again for next spring,<br />\npossibly in April and will be run<br />\nfor a third time.<br />\nWhat the program consists of<br />\nis a two-day weekend tour of the<br />\ndowntown area. People interested<br />\nin participating go to a starting<br />\npoint, get on a bus or van, and<br />\nare taken off to and shown a<br />\nspecific area of the city.<br />\nOnce there, they can get a feel<br />\nfor the area. They can get off the<br />\nbus, walk around, and see what<br />\nit's like to actually live there.<br />\nAt the end of the tour they are<br />\nreturned to their starting point.<br />\nThe last time that the program<br />\nwas run it was extremely successful: over four hundred people participated. Some of them<br />\nwere actual residents of the city<br />\nitself.<br />\nMany remarked that they<br />\ncouldn't believe what they'd just<br />\nseen. They had no idea of some<br />\nof the attractions the city has to<br />\noffer.<br />\nSo, in the near future, if you<br />\nwant to learn about Baltimore,<br />\ngive them a call. They might have<br />\nsomething for you. And come<br />\nApril, if you have some free time,<br />\ngo to \"Go to Town.\" You just<br />\nmight decide you like Baltimore<br />\nenough to live here.

Despite<br />\nsome unfortunate inconsistencies from this often<br />\nimpeccable group, their recital on October 14 still<br />\nthrilled the audience at the inaugural concert of<br />\nShriver Hall's 24th Concert Series season.<br />\nMore often than not, the Beaux Arts Trio<br />\ndelivers live performances of near-perfect quality. The members collectively possess a stunning<br />\npalate of musical ideas. Well-choreographed<br />\nmovements emphasize contrapuntal and harmonic<br />\nstructures, subtle phrasing allows melodies to melt<br />\ninto thin air, and technical virtuosity adds fuel to<br />\nthe fire of musicality.<br />\nIndividual moments did measure up to the Beaux<br />\nArts' usual quality. During the G-minor Trio, Op.<br />\n15, of Bedrich Smetana, for example, a feverish<br />\nlevel of emotional intensity was charged by some<br />\nof the Beaux Arts' most rhythmically precise<br />\nensemble playing of recent years.<br />\nAs far as delicacy is concerned, the third movement, Allegretto ma non troppo, of Beethoven's<br />\nE-flat Trio, Op. 70 no. 2, took the prize. In a<br />\ndialogue between piano and violin, the primary<br />\ntheme was manipulated by two masters, pianist<br />\nMenahem Pressler and violinist Isidore Cohen.<br />\nPressler favored a thoughtful, tenuto phrasing<br />\nwhile Cohen gave a straightforward account of<br />\nsublime lyricism. What could have been a tug-ofwar emerged as a smooth volley.<br />\nBut the most consistently exciting music of the<br />\nevening was made by cellist Peter Wiley, whose<br />\nmembership in the Trio began only in 1988, 33<br />\nyears after its official debut. Wiley's playing took<br />\non a quality of vocal imitation in the Smetana Trio.<br />\nEven if his stone cold face did not mirror the<br />\nsound, he certainly was able to express Smetana's<br />\ninner torment in this piece, written after the tragic<br /><br />\non Hun-stein<br /><br />\nThe Beaux Arts Trio\u2014from left, Isidore Cohen, Peter Wiley and Menahem Pressler\u2014inaugurated the 34th annual Shriver Hall Concert Series last Saturday.<br />\ndeath of the composer's daughter. Wiley stressed the programmatic aspects of the work, making tender elegies of the more lyrical themes in<br />\nthe second and third movements.<br />\nAs a whole, though, the Beaux Arts did not present as awe-inspiring a performance as the public<br />\nhas come to expect. It seemed the most formidable<br />\nweakness was one of technical origin. Careless<br />\nis not a word often associated with the Beaux Arts,<br />\nbut unfortunately some of the playing was just this.<br />\nThe Beaux Arts' best recent work has been with<br />\ncompositions of a more elegant, linear style.<br />\nPressler's dazzling dexterity and both string<br />\nplayers' sensitivity have provided an exciting<br />\nframework for unparalleled performances of trios<br /><br />\nby such diverse composers as Haydn and<br />\nShostakovich. Unfortunately, the Haydn E-flat<br />\nTrio, Hob. XV:10, was less than charming. Sloppy passagework in each instrument hinted from<br />\nthe beginning that the Beaux Arts was having a<br />\nproverbial \"bad night.\"<br />\nCertainly a few dropped notes in the Smetana<br />\nTrio posed no threat to a climactic performance.<br />\nBut in the final movement of the Beethoven, even<br />\nPressler's finesse could not mask a serious case<br />\nof fumbling through the monstrous piano part.<br />\nSmetana's heart-on-the-sleeve romanticism does<br />\nnot necessitate absolute exactness of detail; but<br />\nBeethoven's compositional precision discourages<br />\nsuch inaccuracies.<br /><br />\nThe Beaux Arts Trio has done more for the promotion of the trio repertoire than any other group<br />\nin history. Its discography spans the entirety of<br />\ntrio literature. The program selection for the<br />\nShriver Hall concert, however, was something less<br />\nthan exciting. Aaron Copland's \"Vitebsk\" has not<br />\naged well since its premiere in 1929; watching<br />\nPressler's characteristic pedagogue-defying<br />\npianism proved far more interesting than the<br />\nmicrotonal music. Beethoven's Op. 70 no. 2 lacks<br />\nhis usual flair for works in this genre; it is<br />\nsomewhat unexceptional in its content. And the<br />\nSmetana Trio, while deserving to be played more<br />\nfrequently, is hardly of the stature necessary to<br />\ncarry a two-hour program.<br /><br />\nThanks to Marlon<br />\nBrando, 'Dry White<br />\nSeason' Succeeds<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nEuzhan Palcy's \"A Dry White Season\" begins<br />\ndeceptively, with two young boys, one black and<br />\none white, energetically playing soccer. Soon the<br />\ngame becomes more confrontational, if still<br />\nplayful; finally the two boys are on the ground,<br />\ntrying to wrench the ball away from each other.<br />\nThe irony of Palcy's visual metaphor, with the<br />\na capella harmonies of Ladysmith Black Mambazo<br />\nin the background, isn't lost on the audience. Black<br />\nand white hands literally ripping the world apart<br />\nare the subject of this well-crafted and disturbing<br />\nfilm.<br />\nSet in South Africa during the 1976 Soweto<br />\nuprising, \"A Dry White Season\" addresses the<br />\nuprising itself somewhat awkwardly. The blacks<br />\nin the townships demand to be taught in English,<br />\nnot Afrikaan, and Paley frames their protest more<br />\nlike a choreographed dance number than an expression of righteous anger. Paley intersperses<br />\nthese scenes from the rioting with the pastoral tranquility of Ben du Toit(Donald Sutherland), a white<br />\nhistory professor whose only tie to the black<br />\ntownships and blacks themselves is his gardener,<br />\nGordon Ngubene (Winston Ntshona), and his<br />\nfamily.<br />\nThese early moments are the only ones in the<br />\nfilm we cannot trust. Paley has difficulty moving<br />\nfrom the spectacle of mass protest to the relative<br />\nquietude of Ben's home; she's better off with the<br />\nintimate character studies that dominate the rest<br />\nof the film. \"A Dry White Season\" succeeds on<br />\na personal level, with each face and segment of<br />\ndialogue etched in our memory, and emotions<br />\nneatly packaged, transmitted and understood. It<br />\nis not a sprawling South African film, like Richard<br />\nAttenborough's \"Cry Freedom,\" but it doesn't<br />\nneed to be.<br />\nBen is drawn into the plight of South African<br />\nblacks when he discovers that Gordon's son has<br />\nbeen detained and killed during the uprising.<br />\nAlthough Ben empathizes, it's half-hearted. Concern for the plight of blacks has not yet awakened in him. He's not evil, just ignorant, looking the other way. He urges Gordon to forget his<br />\nson, as one might forget a dead pet.<br />\nBut Gordon won't forget and along with his wife<br />\nand cynical friend Stanley (Zakes Mokae), begins<br />\nto investigate his son's death. Soon Gordon is detained by South Africa's Special Branch, a sadistic<br />\ngroup of inquisitors led by Captain Stolz (Jurgen<br />\nProchnow). According to the police, Gordon<br /><br />\nhangs himself in his cell shortly thereafter. But<br />\nafter one look at the body, Ben knows otherwise.<br />\nIt is the sight of Gordon's beaten and disfigured<br />\ncorpse that convinces Ben\u2014and the audience\u2014to<br />\ntake up Gordon's cause. In fact, all of the images<br />\nin \"A Dry White Season\" are visceral and border<br />\non the overpowering. Seeing Gordon really only<br />\naffirms our interest; we've already been sickened and convinced by the previously displayed tidy<br />\nrows of slaughtered black schoolchildren in their<br />\nuniforms, damp with blood.<br />\nInevitably, Ben becomes the axis of the film,<br />\nputting the building blocks of his life blindly at<br />\nrisk for the cause he has only recently discovered.<br />\nPaley and co-writer Colin Welland take the film<br />\nin this predictable direction, since movies about<br />\nrace relations simply don't get made unless the<br />\nmain character is white. Like \"Cry Freedom,\"<br />\nin which Steven Biko is murdered in the first thirty<br />\nminutes, the real heroes of\"A Dry White Season\"<br />\nare eliminated early on. And they leave nothing<br />\nbut pseudoheroes: people who can be inspiring,<br />\nbut who still seem hollow and dippy in<br />\ncomparison.<br />\nSutherland's acting is accomplished, but just as<br />\nhe's about to come into his own, he gets the carpet<br />\npulled out from under him by Marlon Brando.<br />\nBrando is mesmerizing as rotund barrister Sheldon<br />\nMcKenzie, a venerable human rights champion<br />\nasked to take one last case. He hesitates at first<br />\nwhen Ben asks for justice, then chides him in an<br />\ninimitable low growl.<br />\n\"Justice and law are distant cousins, Mr. du<br />\nToit,\" McKenzie says, \"and here in South Africa<br />\nthey're not on speaking terms at all.\" The inherent<br />\nmelodrama in the court of law has never been so<br />\nastonishingly reproduced.<br />\nWords spill out of Brando's mouth like<br />\nmolasses, and we wait patiently on every one of<br />\nthem. It is easy to forsee McKenzie's huge frame<br />\njust swallowing up \"A Dry White Season,\" but<br />\nhe's gone when Gordon's inquest ends. Despite<br />\nthe horrifying details of the inquest, we wish it<br />\nto go on and on. Brando captivates in every frame,<br />\nsnarling and floating through the courtroom with<br />\nthe predatory grace of a stately lion.<br />\nWhat is remarkable besides Brando's performance is the rapidity with which the character is<br />\nfamiliar to us. McKenzie is not a cliche by any<br />\nmeans; in fact, we have sadly little body of<br />\nreference to refer him to. The same is true of<br />\nMelanie, the journalist played by Susan Sarandon.<br />\nMelanie may be just another jaded reporter, but<br /><br />\nMarlon Brando (left) and Donald Sutherland in Euzhan Palcy's\"A Dry White Season\"<br />\nshe plays off Sutherland's character brilliantly,<br />\nmaking him aware ofjust how little about South<br />\nAfrica he really knows. Like McKenzie, Melanie<br />\ncould be a movie in herself. But Palcy keeps her<br />\npart neat and tidy and doesn't allow \"A Dry White<br />\nSeason\" to get distracted by these minor<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nAnd Paley keeps the pressure on. Gordon's defiant wife is killed after refusing to obey an eviction notice, and the flashbacks of her resistance<br />\nerupt like staccato bursts of machinegun fire. The<br />\nvalue of Ben's life continues to erode; he loses<br />\nhis job, his wife deserts him, his daughter betrays<br />\nhim. Ironically, he becomes one of the hunted, constantly watched and threatened, ultimately limited<br />\nin his ability to take action. In his desire to understand South African blacks, Ben lives his final days<br />\nmuch like them.<br />\nThe irony of Ben's situation isn't realized until<br />\nthe final moments. \"A Dry White Season\"<br />\ncrescendoes swiftly, ending with a tidy, crowdpleasing blur of retribution. But this one act, based<br />\non a compulsion by one individual, hardly ends<br />\nthe film on a note of equilibrium. The film is fic-<br /><br />\ntion, which is also misleading, since the reality<br />\nis probably much worse. Most troubling of all is<br />\nthat \"A Dry White Season\" was set in 1976,<br />\nmeaning that for 13 years the cycle of horror<br />\npainstakingly recreated here has been repeated in<br />\nSouth Africa.<br /><br />\nA DRY WHITE SEASON<br />\nA Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Release<br />\nDirected by Euzhan Palcy<br />\nWritten by Colin Welland and Euzhan Palcy<br />\nBased on the novel by Andre Brink<br />\nProduced by Paula Weinstein<br />\nExecutive Producer Tim Hampton<br />\nDirectors of Photography Kelvin Pike, B.S.C.,<br />\nand Pierre William Glenn<br />\nProduction Designed by John Fenner<br />\nEdited by Sam O'Steen and Glenn Cunningham<br />\nCasting by Mary Selway<br />\nMusic by Dave Grusin<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nMO<br /><br />\nVIES<br /><br />\n'Fabulous Baker Boys' Go<br />\nNoplace without their Singer<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nIn Steve Kloves' promising but<br />\nuneven \"The Fabulous Baker<br />\nBoys,\" Frank and Jack Baker<br />\n(Beau and Jeff Bridges) tell corny jokes, play forgettable songs,<br />\nand slightly entertain apathetic<br />\nnightclub crowds. They're lounge<br />\nlizards from hell, a piano act as<br />\nlovable as stale cigarette smoke.<br />\nAt one point, Jack suggests a<br />\ncall to the Sheraton, based on a<br />\ntip that their harpist has appendicitis. We can sense a pattern<br />\nhere: this duo has been at it a long<br />\ntime, small clubs and low expectations. It's a mundane and<br />\ninauspicious introduction. But<br />\nwhen a gorgeous singer spices up<br />\ntheir act, \"The Fabulous Baker<br />\nBoys\" make beautiful music.<br />\nLike the Baker Boys themselves,<br />\nthe film succeeds when it gets the<br />\nact together. Otherwise it's strictly cocktail peanuts.<br />\nFrank is the business end of the<br />\nrelationship, less talented artistically than Jack, but more<br />\nastute financially. Frank realizes<br />\na change in the act is necessary,<br />\nafter fifteen years, to stay competitive and solvent. At the end<br />\nof a bruising montage of auditions, (\"there was a certain surreal quality to it,\" Frank admits)<br />\nSusie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) arrives.<br />\nDiamond is an hour and a half<br />\nlate, chews gum violently, and,<br />\nas entertainment experience, offers her work for an escort service. But can she sing! Diamond<br />\nhas a sultry, infinitely sexy voice<br />\n(Pfeiffer's own) that wafts into<br />\nthe room, grabs you by the<br />\nthroat, and penetrates your soul.<br />\nBut just as we're getting<br />\nengulfed in the rhapsody of it, the<br /><br />\ngum's back in her mouth and<br />\nshe's casing the place, full of sarcasm and without one ounce of<br />\nsophistication. She joins the act<br />\nlooking proudly out of place, and<br />\nglides on stage like she may have<br />\ncopped some moves from a slowmotion tape of Ax! Rose. But<br />\nSusie's a pro, and she adjusts,<br />\neven to singing \"Feelings.\"<br />\n\"The Fabulous Baker Boys,\"<br />\nquite simply, skyrockets to<br />\nanother plane when Michelle<br />\nPfeiffer enters the film. And on<br />\nwave after wave she carries us:<br />\nher songs, her wit and cockiness.<br />\nEven standing still she makes the<br />\nearth move. Pfeiffer is completely mesmerizing; arguably, she's<br />\nthe sexiest and most beautiful film<br />\nactress ever. One must only see<br />\nher scorching rendition of\"Making Whoopee\" to believe.<br />\nBut the depth Pfeiffer brings to<br />\nher performance is independent<br />\nof these physical attributes. When<br />\nDiamond is onstage she's a different person, perhaps the real<br />\nperson, in touch with her core.<br />\nNot overly theatrical, just incredibly honest.

(The athlete<br />\nwho drinks during a game needs<br />\nmore help and direction than this<br />\narticle can provide.)<br />\nOne sportsman's myth is that<br />\na mug of beer or glass of wine<br />\nbefore competition helps calm the<br />\nnerves, and can thus lead to a better performance. While a small<br />\namount of alcohol may induce<br />\ncalmness, that same small amount<br />\ncan lead to reduced coordination,<br />\ndepression, and anxiety. Gabe<br />\nMirkin, doctor in the sportsmedicine department at the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, says,<br />\n\"Alcohol depresses the activity of<br />\nyour central nervous system,<br />\nmaking you slower, and dulling<br />\nyour thought processes.\" Pregame drinking is also risky<br />\nbecause it can lead the athlete to<br />\nbelieve his or her success resides<br />\nin beer rather than within himself<br />\nor herself; once an athlete<br />\nestablishes a routine that is<br />\ncredited with his or her success,<br />\nthe pattern is hard to break.<br />\nInstances of drinking before a<br />\ngame are rare compared to postgame beer consumption. The<br />\nfitness rationale has been that<br />\nbeer contains the natural elements<br />\nthat the body needs after a serious<br />\nworkout. Some athletes use this<br />\nargument to justify excessive<br /><br />\nby Jeffrey Blitz<br /><br />\nDave Elkes (3), the Centennial Conference's top punter, in action against Ursinus.<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Calendar<br />\nFootball<br /><br />\nSaturday<br /><br />\nGEORGETOWN<br /><br />\nSoccer<br /><br />\nSaturday<br />\nTuesday<br /><br />\nFRANKLIN &amp; MARSHALL 10:45 am<br />\nWIDENER<br />\n7:00 pm<br /><br />\nMen's Cross Country<br /><br />\nSaturday<br /><br />\nWASHINGTON COLLEGE<br /><br />\n2:00 pm<br /><br />\nWomen's Volleyball<br /><br />\nMonday<br /><br />\nMarymount at Notre Dame<br /><br />\n7:00 pm<br /><br />\n2:00 pm<br /><br />\nThere are times when the goals<br />\nof an athlete do not coincide with<br />\nthe goals of a fitness-conscious<br />\nperson. The image of the athlete<br />\npresented in ancient legend is one<br />\nof an extraordinary person. Today, though, the ambitions of<br />\nsome college athletes do not appear to include improved physical<br />\nsoundness. In that category of<br />\nathlete is the player who abuses<br />\nalcohol. Athletes and alcohol<br />\nhave a long history together; the<br />\nwisdom of that juxtaposition<br />\nneeds to be examined.<br />\nPeople have speculated that<br />\ncollege athletes and alcohol so<br />\nreadily go together because of<br />\noverconfidence on the part of the<br />\njock. On the court or field, these<br />\nathletes push their bodies to the<br />\nlimits and prove their resiliency.<br />\nOff the court, in a bar or at a party, these same people seek to<br />\nshow the toughness of their<br />\nbodies by guzzling beers or doing shots. In the early stages,<br />\nthese athletes can be misled into<br />\nbelieving that a one-day hangover<br />\nis the single result of alcohol<br />\nabuse. In fact, the harmfulness of<br />\nalcohol abuse to the athlete's performance should not be<br />\nunderestimated or belittled.<br />\nWhatever you think of drinking<br />\nand college students in general,<br />\nthere is no place for abuse of<br />\nalcohol in the lifestyle of the<br />\nserious athlete.<br /><br />\nFootball loses<br />\nFOOTBALL, from 16<br /><br />\nField Hockey<br /><br />\nToday<br />\nMonday<br /><br />\nSTUDEN<br />\n&amp;FACULTY<br /><br />\nFARES<br /><br />\nat Georgetown<br />\n3:30 pm<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference Playoffs<br />\nFirst It'mind Game<br /><br />\nReplace Your Glasses With<br /><br />\nCONTACT LENSES<br />\nThere's a Contact Lens For You For Studying, Any Sports Activity or Just Looking Your Best.

Even<br />\nprofessional athletes are not exempt from this thinking. Butch<br />\nBuchholz, the commissioner for<br />\nWorld Team Tennis, has said,<br />\n\"Almost every tennis player in<br />\nthe world, both male and female,<br />\ndrinks a beer after a game. The<br />\nalcohol goes out in the urine and<br />\nthe athlete can play the next day<br />\nwith no side effects.\"<br />\nDespite this observation, drinking can be harmful to the athlete's<br />\nperformance. Getting the alcohol<br />\nout of your body does not perfectly remedy the situation; damage<br />\nis done while the alcohol is in<br />\nyour system, and your ability to<br />\nplay will be adversely affected.<br />\nRobert Haas, author of Eat to<br />\nWin, explained the truth about<br />\ndrinking after competition.<br />\n\"Alcohol is a dehydrating<br />\nsubstance. It blocks the release of<br />\nthe anti-diuretic hormone(ADH)<br />\nwhich helps to regulate the<br />\namount of water lost in the urine.<br />\nThe less ADH released by the<br />\npituitary gland, the more water<br />\nlost. And...along with that water<br />\ngo important minerals that<br />\nmuscles require for peak<br />\nperformance.\"<br />\nThe case against drinking is<br />\nmade stronger still when Haas<br />\nwrites that \"alcohol also destroys<br />\nvitamins (especially thiamine and<br />\nvitamin B-1, a key factor in<br />\nenergy metabolism) and has a<br />\ndirect, toxic effect on many<br />\norgans, including the liver and<br />\nkidneys.\"<br />\nThe myth of the college jock is<br />\nthat he is so physically fit that<br />\nalmost nothing can harm him.<br />\nThe nature of alcohol abuse is<br />\nsuch that you can be fooled into<br />\nthinking no harm has come\u2014you<br />\ndo feel normal a day or two<br />\nlater\u2014when in fact athletic performance, not to mention overall<br />\nhealth, is drastically affected.

Iwai had<br />\nskipped tennis last year to concentrate on academies.<br />\nThe addition of Braude, a<br />\npower-oriented player from New<br />\nJersey, could also improve the<br />\nteam, which only lost one player<br />\nto graduation (Jon Holzman). The<br />\nstriking improvement of Sam<br />\nKim, who practiced daily over<br />\nthe summer and developed a<br />\ncannon-like first serve, should<br />\nalso help. Tony Sangchompuphen, a sophomore who missed almost every match last year<br />\ndue to laboratory requirements<br />\n(not an uncommon problem for<br />\nthe Hopkins tennis team), also<br />\nplayed extensively over the summer and may be a major contributor to this year's squad.<br />\nAll these factors have added a<br />\ngreat deal of depth, which is<br />\ncrucial when each regular season<br />\nmatch consists of six singles matches and three doubles matches.<br />\n\"We feel confident that we'll get<br />\nvictories in the fourth, fifth, and<br /><br />\nsixth singles slots, because the<br />\nguys who will be playing there<br />\nare on the same level as most<br />\nother teams' one through three<br />\n[singles] players.\" Ironically,<br />\ncoach Bill Nelson is faced with<br />\nthe opposite problem from last<br />\nyear, when he often had to work<br />\nto scrounge up enough players to<br />\nconstitute a full squad. This year,<br />\nhe will have to pick only six<br />\nplayers when there are at least<br />\nseven potential starters.<br />\nNelson is also optimistic about<br />\nthe team. \"With the addition of<br />\nseveral fine freshmen prospects<br />\nand the return of Ryu lwai, and<br />\nthe fact that we're returning<br />\neveryone but Jon Holzman, I<br />\nthink the prospects are good for<br />\na successful spring season,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"I think there's going to be a<br />\nbig, big turnaround [from last<br />\nyear],\" said lwai. \"A lot of that<br />\nis due to new players and a better overall attitude on the team.\"<br />\nlwai went on to predict the team<br />\nwould finish \"way over .500\"<br />\nand thus eclipse the percent improvement mark posted by the<br />\nOrioles this season. Another factor which may contribute to the<br />\nBlue Jays' expected resurgence is<br />\ntheir increased experience. lwai<br />\nis the only senior, but the bulk of<br />\nthe team, Engquist, Missner,<br />\nRoth, Kim, and Sangehompuphen, started many matches<br />\nlast year.<br /><br />\nCHOICE VISA LACROSSE CLASSIC<br />\nat University ofMaryland-Baltimore County<br />\nSaturday<br />\nUMBC vs. Towson St.<br />\nHopkins vs. Loyola<br />\nSunday<br />\nConsolation Game<br />\nChampionship Game<br /><br />\n12:00 noon<br />\n3:00 pm<br />\n12:00 noon<br />\n3:00 pm<br /><br />\nBIA Notes<br />\nby J.F. Guest<br />\nWith the road race, singles tennis, and powder puff this past<br />\nweekend, BIA action was at an<br />\nall-time high. It's really surprising how many people think getting up at 10 a.m. on a Sunday<br />\nmorning in order to bring pain<br />\nupon yourself is a good idea.<br />\nNonetheless, many outstanding<br />\nperformances were turned in by<br />\nthese highly dedicated athletes. In<br />\nthe fraternity division, Sig Ep<br />\nproved tough taking first (John<br />\nMunnich) and fourth, second<br />\nplace went to DU (Todd \"not<br />\nnew guy\" Murray), with Kappa Sig taking third. In the independents, the Earth Science<br />\nteam dominated, capturing first<br />\n(Mike \"Michael\" Stevens) and<br />\nthird, Alpha Phi Alpha took second, the CSA fourth. In the<br />\ndorms Eric Steidinger of VincentWillard proved too marathonic<br />\nfor the rest of the crowd as he<br />\nroared through the 2.2 miles in<br />\n3:58.75 (Swiss timing) shattering<br />\nEubikye Nubindar's world record<br />\nfor the Homewood Run by over<br />\n7 minutes. Second place went to<br />\nChris \"Grieco\" Conlan of<br />\nWood, with Vincent-Willard taking third and fourth.<br />\nThis past weekend also<br />\nfeatured the singles tennis tournament. In the fraternity division,<br />\nDave \"Shoe\" Boxenbaum finished first for FIJI, followed by Phi<br />\nPsi, ZBT, and DU. In the independents, Jay Garg captured<br />\nthe crown with a time of 8:45.32.<br />\nThe dorms finished as follows:<br />\nWilson, Wood, Jennings,<br />\nHollander. In the women's division Mike! Nikkelle destroyed all<br />\nthe competition in the independents, winning for the<br /><br />\nBSU. In the dorms Clark took<br />\nfirst followed by Vincent-Willard<br />\nand McCoy.<br />\nPowder puff football also<br />\nwound down this weekend after<br />\na grueling two-month season. In<br />\nthe sororities, Alphi Phi blanked<br />\nPhi Mu 13 to 0. The dorms<br />\nfeatured Royce dominating<br />\nMcCoy 26 to 0. Royce also<br />\nfeatured Kenya (she doesn't have<br />\na last name) who apparently<br />\nsingle-handedly accounted for all<br />\nof the points.<br />\nJust because your parents<br />\naren't coming doesn't mean that<br />\nBIA action stops. This weekend<br />\nthe legendary fall lacrosse tournament takes place, check the<br />\ncage for the pairings or call Tony<br />\n\"girly secretary man\" Park<br />\n(889-3021).
