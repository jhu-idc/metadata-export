What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nAs a Young Trustee, I would like to<br />\npromote an attitude on the part of the<br />\nBoard that takes into account the concerns of students more closely when<br />\nestablishing broad University policy. The<br />\ndenial of tenure to an outstanding<br />\nteacher, the opening of school when<br />\nthere is a foot of snow on the ground,<br />\nthe arrest of students for merely sitting<br />\non a quad are all examples of bad decisions that were made in part, I believe,<br />\nbecause students' views were not taken<br />\ninto account when broad policies were<br />\nestablished.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\n<br />\nCandidates for Young Trustee were asked to submit responses to four questions posed by the NewsLetter. The responses of nine of the ten candidates<br />\nare printed here as submitted. The tenth candidate,<br />\nScott McNamee, could not be contacted by the<br />\nNews-Letter and did not submit a statement.<br />\nResponses exceeding the assigned length were cut<br />\nfrom the end.<br />\n<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nThe most important issue facing<br />\nundergraduates is the lack of tolerance<br />\nand understanding at Homewood. Simple acts of expression arouse anger and<br />\nviolence instead of debate and discourse.<br />\nIf this university is to live up to its goal<br />\nof fostering and promoting the quest for<br />\nknowledge, then an atmosphere must be<br />\nestablished that will allow learning and<br />\nresearch to be conducted without fear of<br />\nreprisal or denunciation. I believe the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider the<br />\npresent climate at Homewood as a<br />\nserious threat to the function of the<br />\nUniversity as a center of learning and<br />\nresearch.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI plan to stay in the area for a least two<br />\nor three years, possibly serving in<br />\ngovernment in Washington or Annap-\"s.<br />\nAfter that time, I will decide if I want<br />\nto go to graduate school or law school.<br />\nI do not believe my plans will in any way<br />\naffect the duties of a Young Trustee.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAndrew Chun<br />\nI AN hat are sour qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nI have served this institution from<br />\nseveral perspectives and believe that<br />\nthrough these positions. I have developed<br />\na very wide view of it. As a Trustee I<br />\nbelieve that it will be essential to have<br />\nsuch a view. I have served as parent ambassador, student advisor, representative<br />\nto Student Council for two years. Chairman of the Parents Program for Orientaton '86. tutor in the Tutorial Program,<br />\nBook Store representative, founding,<br />\nmember of the Faculty-Student Interaction program and Treasurer of the Black<br />\nStudents Union. I have also served as student representative on numerous administrative committees. I have also<br />\nworked in the library and fin the S.C.S.<br />\nI believe that I have also not lost contact<br />\nwith the undergrads and their concerns,<br />\nas several of the present student leaders<br />\nhave.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nTo serve this institution to the best of<br />\nmy ability and hopefully have some fun<br />\nalso.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\n<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nMany issues which affect the<br />\nundergraduates have been or are being<br />\nconsidered, including Wolman/McCoy.<br />\na Student Union, Divestment, recruitment of excellent faculty and students.<br />\nand the funding of our expenses. One<br />\nissue which I feel should he looked into<br />\nthough is the focus which this institution<br />\nplaces on the students (includng grads.<br />\nand meds.). When one sees how long it<br />\nhas taken to do any of the above, to improve the security, when one looks at the<br />\nfaculty members which are not being<br />\npromoted. etc., one sometimes wonders.<br />\nI believe that more communication and<br />\na more receptive attitude may help<br />\nchange the wide gap which exists between those who run this school and those<br />\nwho ARE this school.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will they affect your role<br />\nas a Young Trustee?<br />\nNN ill he attending medical school. hut<br />\nhave not finalized where I will he attending. As the YT's arc flown in for<br />\nmeetings I do not envision the distance<br />\nbeing a problem and even as a medical<br />\nstudent I am so organized that this will<br />\nnot be an obstacle.<br />\n<br />\nLoren Heilweil<br />\n1. What are your qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nI've been at Hopkins for four years and<br />\nI care a great deal about this school. I<br />\nam therefore more than willing to put in<br />\nthe large amount of time it takes to be<br />\nan effective Young Trustee. I have not<br />\nplayed a major role in running the Student Council machinery as many of my<br />\nopponents have. I feel this is a plus. During my years here, I have gained a<br />\nperspective very much in tune with the<br />\nlarge majority of Hopkins students.<br />\nAlso, since I plan to become a physician, I don't view the Board of Trustees<br />\na place to make connections or as a<br />\nspringboard for my own careerist ambitions. I will therefore not be afraid to<br />\nmake the Trustees aware of student opinions and views.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nAll of us want to see Hopkins succeed;<br />\nto stay academically and financially<br />\nstrong so our degrees are worth<br />\nsomething. To bring the branches of<br />\nHopkins closer together and make<br />\nHopkins a great place to be. I share and<br />\nam willing to work for these goals. So,<br />\nhowever, is every other Trustee. These<br />\ngoals will be met regardless of who the<br />\nYoung Trustee is.<br />\nMy main objective as Young Trustee<br />\ntherefore is to, in principle as well as<br />\npractice, bring a student's point of view<br />\nto the Board. To make sure the Trustees<br />\nunderstand how their decisions affect<br />\nstudents. I also want to stop the blatant<br />\ndisregard for undergraduate interests that<br />\nseems to be characteristic of the Board.<br />\nOne example being the lack of commitment in improving undergraduate<br />\n<br />\nhousing.<br />\nAnother objective important to me is<br />\nto keep the undergraduates informed of<br />\n<br />\nall I possibly can about the issues before<br />\nthe Board. I would do this through posted<br />\nnotices or periodic bulletins in the NewsLetter. I would plan, if chosen, to keep<br />\nin touch with the undergraduate population at Hopkins, something not done by<br />\nany recent Young Trustee.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nTuition is the most important<br />\nundergraduate issue facing the Board today. I will do my best to halt or at least<br />\nslow the rise of this monster. I will encourage the Board to seek other avenues<br />\nto a balanced budget.<br />\nAnother important issue is criteria for<br />\nfaculty promotions, especially in light of<br />\nthe recent denial of one to Dr. David, and<br />\nthe denial of tenure a couple of years ago<br />\nto Dr. Tu, an excellent math professor.<br />\nWhile I realize that the Board does not<br />\nmake faculty tenure decisions directly,<br />\nit is responsible for shaping the overall<br />\npolicies of the University, which lead to<br />\nthese decisions.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nThe first year after graduation, I will<br />\ntake a job in the Baltimore area to earn<br />\nmoney for medical school. This flexible<br />\nyear will allow a lot of time for performance of Young Trustees' duties. Afterwards, though I will be in medical<br />\nschool, I will give as much time as<br />\nnecessary to the Young Trustee position.<br />\n<br />\n\fYoung Trustee Candidates Speak on Issues<br />\nPaul Kadri<br />\nMary Hiatt<br />\n1. What are your qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nIn the three and a half years that I have<br />\nbeen at Hopkins, I have taken advantage<br />\nof many opportunities to involve myself<br />\nin campus life. Through these experiences, I have gained insight into the<br />\nideals and goals which guide the University, as well as the constraints which it<br />\nfaces. My experiences include working<br />\nwith students, as well as administrators<br />\nand other members of the University<br />\ncommunity, and I think that this exposure<br />\nto many different concerns and responsibilities would be valuable to me as a<br />\nmember of the Board.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nIn terms of what! hope to accomplish,<br />\nI have to say that there is not one goal<br />\nor thing that I have set out to achieve by<br />\nbeing a Young Trustee. My definition of<br />\naccomplishment is to serve the Board and<br />\nthe University by fulfilling the role of a<br />\ntrustee. To be involved with the business<br />\nof the University, to be able to influence<br />\npositively the future direction of the<br />\nUniversity, to be committed to Hopkins<br />\nbeyond being an undergraduate\u2014these<br />\nare the things which I consider accomplishments for a Young Trustee.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\n<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nThere are two issues which I think that<br />\nthe Board should address in the next<br />\nyear. The first one can be described as<br />\nthe quality of undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudent life. This covers lots of areas, the<br />\nmost important being student housing<br />\nand student activities issues. The second<br />\nissue concerns the climate of the University. By this, I mean the lack of tolerance<br />\nfor different opinions, beliefs, and,values<br />\nwhich has recently characterized this environment. Obviously I am not a<br />\nrepresentative of student interests alone,<br />\nbut I think that these are issues which<br />\ndirectly affect the University's ability to<br />\nfulfill its responsibilities to students, as<br />\nwell as to all members of its community.<br />\n4. What are your plans after<br />\ngraduating and how will those plans<br />\naffect your ability to perform the<br />\nduties of a Young Trustee?<br />\nI am in the process of searching for a<br />\njob. With any luck, I will have found<br />\nsomething by graduation. Most likely, I<br />\nwill be in the New York area, or possibly<br />\nWashington, D.C. In either case, I don't<br />\nthink that distance will hinder my ability to perform the duties of Young<br />\nTrustee.<br />\n<br />\nMark Komisky<br />\n1. What are your qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nAs a student leader on this campus, it<br />\nhas been my duty to know and understand the concerns of students and to act<br />\non them in a reasonable and responsible<br />\nmanner. As President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, I have worked with students<br />\nfrom many divisions of Johns Hopkins<br />\nand feel I know the common needs of the<br />\npeople of this University. As Young<br />\nTrustee, I would use my best judgment<br />\nand prior knowledge to accomplish the<br />\ngreatest benefit for both the University<br />\nand its students.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\nYoung Trustee?<br />\nI hope to continue to serve the University as I have enjoyed doing these past<br />\nfour years. It has been my experience<br />\nthat little is ever accomplished by rages<br />\nand sensationalization. To the position of<br />\nYoung Trustee I hope to bring a loyalty<br />\nand a vision most undergraduates do not<br />\nhave for the student body and the University as a whole. It is only by such rational<br />\nthinking and effort that a Young Trustee<br />\ncan hope to fulfill the commission which<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower set forth when he<br />\nestablished the position.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\n<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nAlthough not the most glamorous of<br />\nissues, the need for adequate student<br />\nhousing and amenities as well as library<br />\nspace is a very real problem facing the<br />\nBoard at this time. McCoy and Wolman<br />\nare in desperate need of repair and some<br />\nplans for their renovation and/or<br />\nreconstruction call for additional student<br />\namenities in the buildings. This would<br />\nbenefit not only those students living in<br />\nthese two buildings but all students. Furthermore, our library is literally filled to<br />\ncapacity and needs expansion. I feel these<br />\nimprovements are essential to the wellbeing of undergraduates at this campus.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI plan to work in the BaltimoreWashington area in government service<br />\nfor the next few years before I pursue law<br />\nschool. This will allow me to attend all<br />\nBoard and committee meetings as well<br />\nas remain acquainted with the campus.<br />\nIn my four years at Johns Hopkins I have<br />\nenjoyed seeing the improvements which<br />\nI am sure other Young Trustees have<br />\ndeliberated over; I hope I can do the<br />\nsame for future generations of Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\n<br />\n1. What are your qualifications for being Young Trustee?<br />\nI feel my qualifications are explained in<br />\nmy candidate's statement:<br />\nFor the past four years. I have been involved in several facets of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. I have taken each challenge<br />\nwith the same goal; to make Hopkins a<br />\n,<br />\nbetter place. It is because of this same,,<br />\ngoal that I am running for Young<br />\nTrustee. I feel I have qualities needed to<br />\ndo the job with success and professionalism. Some of the qualities a Young<br />\nTrustee needs are dedication, knowledge<br />\nof the University, and an open mind.<br />\nFor the past three years I have put at<br />\nleast 40 hours a week in extracurricular<br />\nactivities while maintaining my status as<br />\na full time Engineering student. I have<br />\nspent all three summers in Baltimore<br />\nworking on projects for the academic<br />\nyear. Hopefully, you have benefitted<br />\nfrom programs like the Quad Monitors<br />\nand the Project Blue Jay fundraiser.<br />\nThrough other activities, such President<br />\nof the Student Council, Housemaster,<br />\nFraternity involvement, intramural and<br />\nvarsity athletics, et cetera, I have gained a working knowledge of most areas<br />\nof the University. I have seen problems<br />\nfrom a student, administrative, and faculty point of view.<br />\nA Trustee is responsible for most divisions of Hopkins, not just Homewood.<br />\nI feel I am flexible enough to adapt to<br />\nunderstanding the concerns of all.<br />\nAlthough I must be sensitive to all divisions, I will never forget wherer I have<br />\n<br />\ncome from. I do not feel I would be a good<br />\nTrustee if I did not help solve the problems here at Homewood.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nMy first goal is to gain a quick yet<br />\nthorough understanding of all of Johns<br />\nHopkins, as well as the workings of the<br />\nBoard. Secondly, I will bring a current<br />\nunderstanding on problems to the<br />\nTrustees. Finally, I hope to be flexible<br />\nenough to handle unexpected problems<br />\nwith the care, dedication, and loyalty<br />\nwhich I have tried to use while an<br />\nundergraduate<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nPhysical improvements to Homewood<br />\nis the top priority to undergraduates.<br />\nHopkins will be changing for years to<br />\ncome, and I feel both academic and nonicademic buildings should be improved.<br />\nOne of the main problems affecting<br />\nstudents is the lack of communication<br />\nthat comes from a lack of common space.<br />\nThis creates an unhealthy environment<br />\nboth for academic and social interaction.<br />\nwill try to give a first-hand perspective<br />\non the construction needs of Homewood.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI will be working full time either in<br />\nNew York or New Jersey. This will<br />\nallow me to come down for meetings<br />\nwhen necessary.<br />\n<br />\nBryce Quayle<br />\n1. What are your qualifications for the<br />\nposition of Young Trustee?<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI would like to respond to these two<br />\nquestions with the following answer.<br />\nThe position of Young Trustee was<br />\ncreated by Milton Eisenhower to provide<br />\na way for the Board of Trustees to be<br />\ndirectly exposed to student perception,<br />\nneeds, and concerns. However, the<br />\nYoung Trustee also has the same obligation as the other members of the Board<br />\nto maintain and improve the general<br />\nwelfare of the University as a whole. In<br />\nthis undertaking it is necessary to be able<br />\nto look at Hopkins as a multi-faceted institution with various divisions and involvements not only at Homewood, but<br />\nall over the world. It is with this aim in<br />\nmind that I wish to be considered for the<br />\nposition of Young Trustee.<br />\nHaving spent a year at the School of<br />\nInternational Studies in Bologna, Italy,<br />\nI feel that I have developed a much<br />\nbroader perspective on Johns Hopkins<br />\nthan I would have in spending four years<br />\nhere at Homewood. In my three years in<br />\nBaltimore I have been very involved in<br />\nstudent life and organized activities on<br />\ncampus, as well as worked with the administration on many concerns of both<br />\nstudents and the University in general.<br />\nIt is the combination of my experiences<br />\nin Bologna and at Homewood which has<br />\ndeveloped my strong concern for the<br />\nfuture direction of the University and<br />\nwhich makes me feel confident that I am<br />\nqualified for the position of Young<br />\nTrustee. As a Young Trustee I would try<br />\nto make known to the Board the students'<br />\n<br />\ncurrent perceptions mid needs, but even<br />\nmore what it is like to be a student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. In doing this I would riot<br />\nnecessarily be representing the students,<br />\nbut would be emphasizing the importance<br />\nof the Board's consideration of the student element in matters of the Universty's current and future situations.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning. undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of 'Trustees should consider?<br />\nI do not feel that there exists one issue<br />\nthat need be considered by the Board of<br />\nTrustees that is more important to<br />\nundergraduates than any other. What I<br />\ndo feel needs to be done by the Board is<br />\nto not necessarily pick one or two issues<br />\nimportant to undergraduate life, but<br />\nrather to keep the effect on<br />\nundergraduates of its actions in mind<br />\nwhile making and planning decisions. In<br />\norder to achieve this goal I would encourage the Board to continue its efforts<br />\nto communicate with the student body<br />\ndirectly on issues of particular importance, in addition to voicing student concerns myself.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI am currently exploring employment<br />\nopportunities in the financial services industry, specifically in commercial and investment banking. I plan to be working<br />\nin either New York City or in the<br />\nBaltimore/Washington area. In either<br />\ncase I would be readily available to attend both the meetings of the entire<br />\nBoard of Trustees as well as committee<br />\nneetings.<br />\n<br />\n\f6/MARCH 6, 1987<br />\n<br />\n3 RTS<br />\nORAL<br />\nWILL DIE !<br />\nif cny -oa<ins Stuc<br />\n*commits just ono<br />\n*<br />\nsins:<br />\n<br />\nMore Young Trustee<br />\nCandidate Statements<br />\nMarie Rodriguez<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\n*tho following<br />\n*<br />\n4:<br />\n*<br />\n* 1).hcro sec cluooing *<br />\n* 2) monkey socnking<br />\n*<br />\n: 3) \\OT VOTI\\G for the :<br />\n*<br />\nt<br />\nuoconning Stucont<br />\n*<br />\nCouncil ono Young *<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nElections:<br />\nTrustee<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n1.What are your qualifications for being Young Trustee?<br />\nI have been involved with many facets<br />\nof Hopkins life in my years here, including Blue Key Society, the revival of<br />\nmagazine<br />\nthe science fiction<br />\nHopSFAnatic, being a Student Advisor,<br />\nand co-SAC liason to the HOP. This year<br />\nI helped found the Comic Book Club,<br />\nand organize the first Hopkins Cultural<br />\nFestival. Through these and other activities, I believe that I have gained an<br />\ninsight to the thoughts of many different<br />\nstudents, and how to get their support in<br />\nworking together.<br />\n3. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nThe opportunity to be involved with<br />\npeople is one of the greatest things I have<br />\ngained from being here. I have watched<br />\nthe effects of policy on undergraduate<br />\nlife, and understand the ramifications of<br />\nsuch decisions. I would like a hand in<br />\nshaping such policies. I believe that my<br />\ninvolvement with the campus puts me in<br />\na position to help make proper decisions.<br />\nI hope to gain a better understanding of<br />\nthe inner working of the University, and<br />\nto do my best to assure that the policies<br />\nreflect the needs of the undergraduates<br />\nas well as the entire University. I've enjoyed my time here and would welcome<br />\n<br />\nthe chance to influence the future of<br />\nHopkins in an effort to improve the quality of campus life for all members of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins community.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nNot South Africa. I think the issue of<br />\nfinances is a little more immediate for the<br />\nstudent body. Tuition is continuing to increase, and though it admittedly only<br />\npays for a portion of true educational<br />\ncosts, the Board should consider what<br />\nportion of costs students should be<br />\nresponsible for, especially when the<br />\ngovernment is talking about eliminating<br />\nthe NDSL and work-study programs,<br />\nand replacing the GSL with a high interest loan.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\nYoung Trustee?<br />\nEventually, I plan to go to graduate<br />\nschool, but more immediately, I intend<br />\nto spend the next year or two working<br />\nin the Baltimore/Washington area. Since<br />\nI will be close to Hopkins, I will be able<br />\nto attend the board meetings, and remain<br />\naware of what is happening on the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\n<br />\nworked in the library and for the S.C.S.<br />\nI believe that I have also not lost contact<br />\nwith the undergrads and their concerns,<br />\nas several of the present student leaders<br />\nhave.<br />\n2.

The conference<br />\nwas organized by sophomore<br />\nKris Mauren and sponsored by<br />\nthe College Republicans and the<br />\nYoung Democrats.<br />\nFour speakers addressed a<br />\nvariety of topics in forty-minute<br />\nlectures followed by question and<br />\nanswer periods.<br />\nThe first presentation was<br />\n\"Moral Foundations of a Free<br />\nSociety,\" by Robert Sirico.<br />\nSirico, a seminarian at St. Mary's<br />\nCollege, presented an introduction to the other lectures, aspects<br />\nof which were covered in more<br />\ndepth by the other lecturers.<br />\nSirico's lecture was followed<br />\nby \"Capitalism Reconsidered:<br />\nThe History (and Myths) of a<br />\nFree Economy\" by Howard<br />\nBaetjer, Jr. of the Foundation for<br />\nEconomic Education, \u2014 Problems<br />\nand Issues in Economics\" by Don<br />\nBoudreaux of George Mason<br />\nUniversity, and \"The Political<br />\nEconomy of Segregation\" by<br />\nJennifer Roback of'George<br />\nMason.<br />\nA lunch with the speakers and<br />\ntwo discussion periods were also<br />\nincluded, giving those who attended a chance to meet the<br />\nlecturers.<br />\nSirico began his lecture by<br />\nnoting that V.I. Lenin once said<br />\nthat \"Ideas are more fatal than<br />\nguns. There is a reciprocal relationship between what we think<br />\nand what we value, said Sirico,<br />\nsince \"ideas form the basis of<br />\npeople's actions.\"<br />\nHe went on to describe a<br />\nsystem of government which he<br />\nsaid \"may be accepted by all persons who are willing to banish<br />\nforce and fraud\" from their lives.<br />\nThe body of the presentation<br />\nbegan with what Sirico called<br />\n\"the theoretical conditions of<br />\nfreedom.\" He stressed the basic<br />\nimportance of freedom to morality, saying that \"morality that is<br />\nnot chosen is no morality.\" In<br />\n<br />\nsupport of this, he said that no action taken under compulsion<br />\ncould be considered noble or virtuous; without choice, actions<br />\ncannot be considered right or<br />\nwrong since there are no alternatives with which to compare<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe person being compelled by<br />\nforce to act in a certain way does<br />\nnot bear the moral responsibility<br />\nfor his actions, Sirico pointed out.<br />\nLater, he clarified his stand, saying, \"Freedom is not so much a<br />\nvirtue in itself as the context in<br />\nwhich virtue is possible.\"<br />\nHe said that in a truly free<br />\nsociety, the only limits on the<br />\npursuit of values by members of<br />\nthe society are the rights of<br />\nothers. \"I am not an anarchist. I<br />\nwant to be very clear about that,he said in answer to a question at<br />\nthe end of the lecture.<br />\nHe said that he believes the<br />\ngovernment has valid functions,<br />\nbut that these are only those involving protecting its citizens<br />\nfrom internal and external force<br />\nand fraud.\"<br />\nSirico then went on to address<br />\nthe question of rights, describing<br />\n\"what it is about humans which<br />\njustifies their having rights,\" and<br />\nwhat those rights are. \"We are<br />\nself-directing, thinking beings<br />\nwho survive by the use of<br />\nreason,\u2014 he said.<br />\nDiscussing the right of property first, Sirico said that the institution of property stems from a<br />\nrelationship with nature \"that is<br />\nmore than immediate and temporary.\" \"Wealth and property<br />\ncome into existence only when<br />\npeople value things.\" He said that<br />\nwhen the right to property is seen<br />\nin this light, it is \"the safeguard<br />\nof other rights,\" in that it is the<br />\nmost basic demonstration of the<br />\nfreedom to pursue values.<br />\nSirico said that the ideas of both<br />\nconservatives and liberals are<br />\ncounter to the establishment of a<br />\nfree society in many respects.<br />\n\"The liberals would be happy<br />\nwith freedom in the bedroom, but<br />\nno in the marketplace,[while] the<br />\nconservatives would be happy<br />\nwith freedom for big business,<br />\n<br />\nbut not for homosexuals.\u2014 \u2014 Both<br />\n, sides become similar in view of<br />\nthe means which they use to<br />\nachieve their goals\"\u2014force.<br />\nHe said that he is in favor of<br />\nhelping the poor, but he does not<br />\nthink that welfare supported by<br />\ntaxation and administered by the<br />\ngovernment is either an efficient<br />\nor a moral way to provide this<br />\nhelp. He cited statistics showing<br />\nthat private religious charities<br />\ndistribute more than twice as<br />\nmuch aid per dollar received than<br />\ngovernment organizations.<br />\nIn 1984, Sirico said, the total<br />\nbudgets of these private organizations was over $74 billion, plus<br />\nvolunteer time adding to $65<br />\nbillion. He claimed that the totali<br />\nof these exceeded the poverty<br />\nbudgets of the Federal, state, and<br />\nlocal governments combined in<br />\nthat year.<br />\n\"For me, one value is [to<br />\nreverse] the plight of poor people,\" he said. He added that he<br />\ndoes not want to force this value<br />\non anyone else. \"I think a<br />\nmarket-based society is the best<br />\nway to help the poor,\" he explained, saying that production<br />\nrather than distribution should be<br />\nthe first concern of anyone interested in charitable endeavors.<br />\nIf no one is able to produce, there<br />\nwill be nothing to distribute.<br />\nThe fouth lecture of the day,<br />\ngiven by Professor Jennifer<br />\nRoback, was entitled \"The<br />\nPolitical Economy of Segregation.\" Roback discussed the application of what she called<br />\n\"libertarian ideas\" to the<br />\neconomic aspects of racism, concentrating on the problems experienced by blacks in the United<br />\nStates in the period since the Civil<br />\nWar.<br />\nRoback presented a simple<br />\neconomic theory to the effect that<br />\nracial discrimination in employment is costly to the businesses<br />\nwhich practice it, since passing<br />\nup job candidates for less<br />\nqualified candidates of whatever<br />\nrace will result in a less capable<br />\ngroup of employees.<br />\nTherefore, \"in the long run,<br />\nthe competitive process should<br />\n<br />\neliminate differences in earnings to another and bargain tor wages.<br />\nbetween different ethnic groups,\"<br />\nRoback said that most<br />\nshe said, calling this \"a very historians agree that the incomes<br />\nelegant model,\" but one which of black and white farm workers<br />\ndoes not explain the fact that per- in the South during this period<br />\nsistent differences in earnings do were approximately equal.<br />\nexist.<br />\nHowever, many of the laws<br />\nHer conclusion, supported by which institituted the policies of<br />\na historical summary and segregation were economic in efanalysis, was that governmental fect, Roback claimed.

Unlike last year,<br />\nthe decision, at least for the SC top spot, will<br />\nnot be an easy one.<br />\nAs most undergraduates know by now, the<br />\nthree contenders in the battle for the SC<br />\npresidency are Sophomore Class President Scott<br />\nFitzGerald, SC Treasurer David Shade, and<br />\nJunior Class President Sahir Surmeli. All three<br />\nare seasoned Council members and student<br />\nleaders. Each seems capable of doing the job<br />\nand responsible enough to put in the time to do<br />\nit right. So, the election this year seems destined<br />\nto he an election based on\"political\" issues<br />\nrather than on the capability and competence<br />\nof those running. And that is how it should be.<br />\nWe believe that the single most important<br />\npolitical issue in this campaign is defining the<br />\nrole of Council. Traditionally, Council has attempted to serve the dual role of planning social<br />\nevents and dealing with more important<br />\nissues\" like divestment, freedom of speech,<br />\nundergraduate education, intersession, security, etc. . . .<br />\nWith the creation of the HOP several years<br />\nago to oversee the planning of social events and<br />\nwith growing student interest in the \"impor-<br />\n<br />\ntant issues,\" the balance of Council's concerns<br />\nseems to have tipped much more on the side<br />\nof the latter in recent years. We would like to<br />\nsee that trend continue.<br />\nWe hope that, next year, Council wi!I devote<br />\nthe lion's share of its attention to the \"important issues\" and leave social events to the HOP.<br />\nSo this year, we endorse Sahir Surmeli for the<br />\nposition of Student Council President because<br />\nhe seems to share this vision of Council with<br />\nus, much more so than FitzGerald or Shade.<br />\nIf our deciphering of FitzGerald's comments<br />\non these pages last week is correct, FitzGerald<br />\nseems inclined to tip the balance of Council's<br />\nconcerns back to the planning of social events.<br />\nShade, on the other hand believes that \"communication\" ought to be Council's top priority and that Council \"should do whatever it is<br />\nthat is wanted of us. .1by I the student body<br />\nthat year.\" Over the years, we have seen too<br />\nmany SC presidential candidates focusing on<br />\nthe vague notion of improving communication<br />\nand listening to the student body to be very excited about Shade's priorities.<br />\nCouncil needs a leader who intends to tackle<br />\n\"important issues\" next year, not someone who<br />\nwants Council to be throwing parties or \"improving communication.\" We think Sahir<br />\nSurmeli is the best man for the job.<br />\n<br />\nIn the wake of the latest arson<br />\nand wrecking of the Coalition for<br />\na Free South Africa shanty, one<br />\nmust harshly scrutinize claims<br />\nthat free speech is a norm on the<br />\nHopkins campus. It seems that<br />\nevery time leftists try to make<br />\ntheir sentiments known through<br />\naccepted symbolism, this symbolism is violently repressed.<br />\nWhile the repression of leftists is<br />\nnot official or formal policy of<br />\n<br />\nan otherwise happy institution.<br />\nThis explanation cannot begin to<br />\naddress why actions occurred as<br />\nthey did, for it assumes things we<br />\nknow cannot be true: that Muller<br />\nwould choose to disrupt campus<br />\npeace without reason. In fact, we<br />\nknow that Muller is a highly<br />\nastute politician who does not<br />\ntake the least of his actions lightly. We must conclude that Muller<br />\nwas under great pressure to act as<br />\n<br />\ndan schechter<br />\n<br />\nay group on campus, it is con- he did. Understanding this<br />\nsistently applied.

That<br />\nnews already had its fifteen<br />\nminutes. Now respectfully mixed reviews appear. Soon it will be<br />\ntime to defend Warhol.<br />\nFive arguments against Warhol<br />\nconsidered.<br />\n(1) Warhol was a glorified<br />\ncommercial artist. He began by<br />\ndrawing shoes. The implied<br />\ndistinction is not meant to elevate<br />\n\"high art\" or classical work, but<br />\nusually to denigrate commercial<br />\nor contemporary efforts, It goes<br />\nfar beyond Warhol. Accepting it<br />\nis ironic. After agreeing that common design ought to be<br />\ndisposable and not up to some<br />\nmystical standard, the proponent<br />\nof \"high art only\" then turns<br />\naround and says, look at how<br />\nterrible this common stuff is, how<br />\ngaudy our suburbs are. This is a<br />\nself-fulfilling prophecy which<br />\ncondemns society to rotten style,<br />\nexcept in museums.<br />\n(2) Warhol was too cool. He<br />\nwas too hip. He was merely posing. This argument is popular, if<br />\nonly because it appeals to reverse<br />\nelitism. There is, now more than<br />\never, a sense of things being too<br />\nfashionable and trendy, which is<br />\nto say, they are unfashionable and<br />\nought to be avoided. For the cult<br />\nthat follows each passing fad,<br />\nthere is an even larger hidden<br />\ngroup that shies away or despises<br />\nthat thing for its popularity\u2014just<br />\nas well, for that too is in. Warhol<br />\nfell victim to this. All of modern<br />\nart does.<br />\n(3) Warhol was too obvious.<br />\n\"Being good in business is the<br />\nmost fascinating kind of art,\" he<br />\nsaid. Regardless of the quality of<br />\nthe work, this ambition annoys<br />\nthose who would like art to have<br />\na certain supposed dignity. In<br />\ncriticizing Warhol then, this attitude leads to confusing the art<br />\nwith the marketing, when such<br />\nblurring by Warhol is precisely<br />\nwhat horrifies the uptight. It is a<br />\nclever tactic: criticism of the<br />\ncommercial aspect is directed<br />\nagainst the artistic aspect; all the<br />\nwhile, the two are proclaimed<br />\nseparate. If the business of<br />\ncriticism is to come down to such<br />\nthings as the price of the latest<br />\nwork, then it is perhaps appropriate to ask simply whether<br />\nin a society where a baseball<br />\n<br />\nSpam on Wry<br />\nAnd Just How Throaty Are<br />\n3.

So the proper response is to agree with what<br />\nis said on the surface, thus turning the trick around and winning<br />\nby losing. Confusing? By<br />\nescalating the levels of interpretation, anything comes to mean<br />\nanything but. For Warhol, this is<br />\naltogether perfect.

He should<br />\nknow that just because all the<br />\nother schools are raising their tuition is no reason for doing<br />\nlikewise; two wrongs do not<br />\nmake a right. With no inflation,<br />\nmillions and millions pouring in<br />\nfrom the mostly vain, the death<br />\nthroes of the American Dream,<br />\nthe faction-induced decline in<br />\nschool spirit, my intellect craves<br />\n<br />\nsomething more sophistical, e.g.<br />\na roasting-over of our venerable<br />\nabode's ways and means. I call to<br />\nthe student body's attention how<br />\nlast year the Hebrew University<br />\nin Israel was shut down by its<br />\nstudents when the authorities<br />\nthere tried to raise tuition to abo'ut'<br />\n$1000, the amount by which<br />\nHopkins wants to INCREMENT<br />\nits tuition.<br />\nStan Lippman<br />\n<br />\nGroundless Decision<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAn Academic Council, ignoring the unanimous recommendation of the Political Science<br />\ndepartment, has refused to promote Dr. David. Consequently,<br />\nhe will have to leave Hopkins at<br />\nthe end of the semester. He will<br />\nbe missed by the many students<br />\nwho will be unable to take classes<br />\nwith him. His classes are very interesting, and essential to the International Relations major. The<br />\ndecision to deny him promotion<br />\nis a very poor one, and seems<br />\ngroundless.

Though I<br />\nrespect the Academic Council's<br />\n<br />\ndecision, I would like to point out<br />\nseveral facts that I hope will cause<br />\nthe Council to reconsider.<br />\nDr. David's care and willingness to interact with students<br />\nshould be considered by the.<br />\nCouncil. First, he is the advisor<br />\nto approximately fifty students.<br />\nSecond, he teaches many interesting and valuable courses. It<br />\nis due in large part to Dr. David<br />\nthat the Political Science Department has such diverse classes as<br />\nContemporary International<br />\nPolitics, National Security in the<br />\nNuclear Age, and The Superpower Competition in the Third<br />\nWorld. Third, he helps students<br />\nextensively outside of the<br />\nacademic sphere. For instance,<br />\nDr. David has frequently spoken<br />\nto the International Studies<br />\nForum, and has organized<br />\nnumerous lecture series on<br />\nvarious matters of public interest.<br />\nHe also recently volunteered to<br />\nbring students to the Aberdeen<br />\nProving Grounds as part of the<br />\nFaculty-Student Interaction<br />\nProgram.<br />\nIt is hoped that the Academic<br />\nCouncil will also consider Dr.<br />\nDavid's role as the coordinator of<br />\nthe International Studies major. It<br />\nis no exaggeraton to say that Dr.<br />\nDavid is the IR Program, for it<br />\nis his work that keeps it functioning. Among other things, Dr.<br />\nDavid supervises the fulfillment<br />\nof IR requirements, the BA-MA<br />\nProgram, the Semester at SAIS,<br />\nand various internship programs.<br />\nUnder Dr. David's guidance<br />\nand leadership, the IR Program<br />\nhas blossomed into one of the best<br />\n<br />\nIt's eleven p.m.<br />\nDo you know where your paperis?<br />\n<br />\nat Hopkins. The IR major is<br />\npresently the second-largest on<br />\ncampus; the number of entering<br />\nIR majors has continually increased as more students learn<br />\nabout the quality of this program.<br />\nIndeed, the reputation of the<br />\nHopkins IR major is recognized<br />\nnationwide. Much of this can be<br />\ncredited to Dr. David's commitment and work during the last six<br />\nyears. Dr. David's departure<br />\nwill be greatly detrimental to<br />\nHopkins. The IR program will<br />\nbecome chaotic and directionless,<br />\nthe Poll. Sci. department will lose<br />\na great professor. The loss of Dr.<br />\nDavid's wonderful teaching will<br />\naffect not only IR and Poli. Sci.<br />\nmajors but others as well. In fact,<br />\nsome of the best praises for Dr.<br />\nDavid have come from non-IR<br />\nmajors who have had the opportunity to take his excellent<br />\nclasses.<br />\nhope very much that the<br />\nAcademic Council will reconsider its previous decision in light<br />\nof Dr. David's many contributions to this school and its<br />\nstudents.

Why, one must ask,<br />\nwould the Council risk doing such<br />\ndamage?<br />\nProfessor David virtually<br />\nremade the international studies<br />\nmajor; it has burgeoned during<br />\nhis tenure at Hopkins. The administrative workload (catering to<br />\nsome 2(X)s students each week) is<br />\nenormous. Yet, despite the fact<br />\nthat until this year, he had no administrative assistance, Professor<br />\nDavid has published diverse<br />\nworks, including his most recent<br />\nThird World Coups d'Etat and International Security, while<br />\nteaching several courses each<br />\nyear. Incredibly, despite<br />\nunanimous departmental support,<br />\ndsepite the ad hoc committee's<br />\nrecommendation, and despite<br />\nProfessor David's superb performance, the Academic Council<br />\ndenied his promotion.<br />\nSuch a decision can have only<br />\nnegative effects.

Johns<br />\nHopkins didn't even make the championship game in 1986<br />\nand, according to most preseason predictions, they're not<br />\nexpected to get back this season. Of course, those same<br />\npeople probably counted the L.A. Lakers out too this year.<br />\nStill, this may be the year that Hopkins haters around<br />\nthe nation have been waiting for. Losses to graduation<br />\nand injury have been severe for Don Zimmerman's Blue<br />\nJays, who open their '86 campaign tomorrow at Syracuse.<br />\nMost notably absent are midfielder Del Dressel and<br />\ndefenseman John DeTommaso, two of the all time greats<br />\nwho combined for an astounding seven 1st-team AllAmerica honors. That roar you hear from upstate New<br />\nYork is the score-happy Orange attack anticipating a Blue<br />\nJay close defense with no returning starters and a midfield where four of the six regulars are new.<br />\nAll hope is not lost, though, as Zimmerman can still<br />\ncall on several of his stars from years past. The starting<br />\nattack unit of 1st-team All-Americas Brian Wood and<br />\nCraig Bubier, along with Mike Morrill, returns intact.<br />\nWood, however, has been shifted to midfield in what<br />\namounts to the big news of the offseason.<br />\nWhy tamper with your leading scorer (Wood had 22<br />\ngoals and 28 assists last year) and arguably your best<br />\niplayer? \"We're deep at attack,\" says Zimmerman. \"He<br />\ngives us that extra scoring punch that we lost when Dressel<br />\ngraduated.\"<br />\nFor Wood, it means that he'll be getting his 20-30 goals<br />\nfrom further away and more towards the middle. No<br />\nlonger will he be able to deliver feeds from behind the<br />\nnet or sneak around the sides as now he has defensive<br />\nresponsibilities. How well Wood takes to his new environment may well determine whether the Jays can make it<br />\nto Rutgers for the Final Four. Of course, if this is all they<br />\n<br />\nneed, then it will be no problem, as Wood has the versatility<br />\nand cannon shot to make Zim look like a genius.<br />\nScoring in general won't be the problem, as the squad<br />\nis loaded with guns. Co-captain Bubier led Hopkins in<br />\ngoals last year with 35, including an astounding eight<br />\nagainst Navy. With Dressel gone and Wood moved, he<br />\nmay well score 50 this year. Morrill, who has started since<br />\nhe's been at Hopkins, probably deserved to make AllAmerica last year. The problem is that there just aren't<br />\nenough balls to go around. He's scored 45 goals in two<br />\nyears here, which is even more impressive when you consider that he's only taken 109 shots.<br />\nThere's no question that the Jays can put the ball in the<br />\nnet, the problem is whether they can keep it out. After<br />\ntwo years of Larry Quinn in goal, Blue Jay fans gave his<br />\nreplacement, Stu Jones, a hard time when he struggled<br />\nearly. By season's close, though, Jones played as well<br />\nas anyone (59% save pct.) and this year has looked even<br />\nbetter. He'll get the nod again as now he is the veteran<br />\non a young team.<br />\nOn defense, Honorable Mention All-America Steve Mitchell is the sole returnee among the regulars. He teamed<br />\nwith Brad McLam on the rope last year to give the Jays<br />\nperhaps the best tandem on such a unit ever. This season,<br />\nthough, Zimmerman doesn't have such a luxury as he'll<br />\nhave to get the 6'5\", 210 lb. senior on the field as much<br />\nas possible, which means work at both rope and close<br />\ndefense.<br />\nAll in all, it could be a tough year for Blue Jay fans,<br />\nwho consider anything less than a title a disappointment.<br />\nDon't count the Jays out though, for whenever they look<br />\ndown they always seem to develop a star out of nowhere<br />\nand bounce back. The following is a breakdown by position on how the '87 Jays shape up.<br />\n<br />\nATTACK<br />\nIn 1985, Zimmerman started a unit of then sophomores<br />\nBubier and Wood and freshman Morrill. Experts predicted<br />\nthat in two years Hopkins might field the best attack ever.<br />\nWell, it's two years later now, and while they've done<br />\nnothing to disappoint, the shift of Wood to midfield<br />\nprecludes any comparisons to the past. They'll still be<br />\npretty dominant, though. Bubier poses a serious matchup<br />\nproblem for opposing coaches. At 6.3.\u2022. 2 I() lbs. he bigger than most defenseman and he can move around the<br />\ncrease with the best of them. He has the potential and the<br />\nblazing shot to totally take over a game, as he did against<br />\nNavy last year. Look for Bubier to set up both behind<br />\nthe net, where his height makes him an ideal feeder, and<br />\nright in front about 10-15 feet away where he'll take the<br />\npass and deposit it in the goal before you can blink.<br />\nMorrill will inherit Wood's role from last season, and<br />\nhopefully will be handed down his stats as well. He'll face<br />\ndefenses that are more tuned to him now, but he'll also<br />\nsee the ball a lot more often. It may be tough for Morrill<br />\nto match his outstanding shooting percentage, but if he<br />\ncan it would mean a 40 goal season.<br />\nThe third starter right now is John Ciccarone, a<br />\nsophomore who's back at Hopkins after a year's \"sabbatical\". He was used seldomly as a freshman two years<br />\nago (2 goals, 3 assists) but has looked impressive this<br />\nspring in practices and scrimmages, and Zimmerman has<br />\nfull confidence. Ciccarone beat out, among others, Jeff<br />\nIhm, a sophomore who was the 4th attackman last season<br />\nand saw a lot of action, particularly on man-up situations.<br />\nIhm, as well as freshman Scott Marr will see plenty of<br />\nContinued on LAX/8<br />\n<br />\n\f2/MARCH 6, 1987<br />\n<br />\n'Toughest Schedule In The Nation' Awaits Jays<br />\nby Larry Grossman<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Blue Jays begin their<br />\nat<br />\nquest to regain the Division I Lacrosse title Saturday<br />\ngoare<br />\nthey<br />\ngo<br />\nword<br />\nthe<br />\nSyracuse University. And from<br />\ning to have their work cut out for them. The combination<br />\nof the toughest schedule in Division I Lacrosse and heavy<br />\ntosses from last year's team has caused coach Zimmerman to acknowledge the possibility of, \"four teams<br />\nfinishing ahead of us\u2014North Carolina, Maryland,<br />\nVirginia and Syracuse.\" The Blue Jays will play six top<br />\nten Division I schools as well as traditional Division III<br />\npower Washington College. Of the remaining three games<br />\ntwo are on the road as are games against Syracuse,<br />\nMaryland and defending champs North Carolina.<br />\nIf the schedule weren't a big enough problem on its own<br />\nthe Hopkins squad has several question marks that will<br />\nneed to be answered if they are to seriously vie for the<br />\ntitle. Graduation and injuries have left the team thin on<br />\nexperienced defensemen and midfielders. Several players<br />\nwho have not seen much playing time will have to pick<br />\nup the slack left by the departure of four of last years top<br />\nfive defaisemen. The midfield alsci looks- a Me weak<br />\nthe loss of four-time All-America Del Dressel and injuries<br />\nto Jack Crawford, Brendan Kelly and Freshman Mark<br />\nDressel.<br />\nDespite all of the question marks and their tough<br />\nschedule the Jays should be expected to do well this<br />\nseason. The fact that they do not enter this season as defending champions will mean that opponents won't be as<br />\npumped up for the Jays as in years past. The fact that for<br />\nthe first time in quite a while Hopkins will be picked as<br />\nthe underdog in several contests should also help the Jays.<br />\nUnlike years past when talent alone practically guaranteed<br />\nthe Jays a spot in the Finals, this year Hopkins will have<br />\nto scratch and claw for almost every victory. For this<br />\nreason, this year's campaign should prove to be most exciting and competitive. Here is how the schedule looks<br />\ngame by game.<br />\nSYRACUSE<br />\nSaturday, March 7<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 10-3<br />\n<br />\nAway 7:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nLast year's game against the visiting Syracuse Orange<br />\nwas one of the most bizarre in recent memory. The Jays<br />\ncame out colder than dry ice and found themselves trailing 11-3 after three quarters of comatose play. Then, after<br />\nmuch of the frost-bitten crowd left for warmer confines,<br />\nthe Jays staged a furious comeback, closing to within<br />\n11-10. Hopes for a tie, however, sailed away with Craig<br />\nBubier's errant shot with 20 seconds to play and Coach<br />\nZimmerman was handed his first home loss. This year<br />\nHopkins will travel up to Syracuse with hopes of avenging that loss and spoiling the Oranges' home opener.<br />\nSyracuse will enter this game with a very strong team.<br />\nLast year as a freshman, Syracuse attackman John Zulberti<br />\ndazzled the Homewood crowd with some outrageous<br />\nstickwork. As a sophomore this year, he will team with<br />\nsenior All-America sniper Tom Nelson to form one of<br />\nthe top attack units in the country. Senior All-America<br />\nTodd Curry, whom many considered to be the best player<br />\nin Division I lax last year, will again be the main man<br />\nat midfield. Curry used his outstanding speed and<br />\nquickness to tally five goals against the Blue Jays last year.<br />\nSenior goalie Jim Gyory had an excellent season last year,<br />\nsaving over 63 percent of all opponent shots on goal. The<br />\nloss of several top defensemen from last year's team will<br />\nput Gyory on the spot a bit, though.<br />\nThis year's game played indoors at the Carrier Dome<br />\nshould be as fast-paced as early season game as you are<br />\nlikely to see. The Syracuse game plan will be run and<br />\ngun, fast breaking at every opportunity. To counter this<br />\nHopkins must control the faceoffs and the ground ball<br />\npossessions. The Blue Jays are going to have to score<br />\ngoals, lots of them, if they are to win this game. The combination of a loaded Syracuse offense and an inexperienced<br />\nHopkins defense should make for a big day for the Orange<br />\nmarksmen. That and the fact that this will be the Blue Jays'<br />\nfirst regular season game, plus home field advantage for<br />\nthe Orange should make for a Syracuse victory. Final<br />\nScore: Syracuse 14, Hopkins 12.<br />\nRUTGERS<br />\nSaturday, March 14<br />\nSeries Record: Jays Lead 20-3<br />\n<br />\nAway 2:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nLast year Rutgers advanced to the second round of the<br />\nNCAA tournament before losing to Syracuse. Led by 50point attackman Ed Trubulsy, the Scarlet Knights will field<br />\nanother middle-of-the-pack team. Hopkins will use this<br />\ngame to lick any wound left after playing Syracuse and<br />\nto instill some confidence in the young team. Not much<br />\n<br />\ncan be said about this one. Hopkins should win; and win<br />\nbig. Trouble in this game could mean a very long season<br />\nis in store for the Blue Jays. Final Score: Hopkins 15,<br />\nRutgers 8.<br />\nWASHINGTON COLLEGE<br />\nTuesday, March 17<br />\nSeries Record: Jays Lead 26-1<br />\n<br />\nHome 3:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' home opener will be against Division III<br />\npower Washington College. Don't let their Division III<br />\nstanding fool you, though. The Shoremen are one of the<br />\ntop 10 lacrosse teams in the nation. With a solid attack<br />\nand very deep midfield and defense units, Washington<br />\nCollege will field a very experienced and disciplined team.<br />\nAnd after opening up their season at North Carolina they<br />\nwon't be in awe of Division I power Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nJays, however, will have too much going for them in this<br />\ngame for the Shoremen to overcome. In addition to<br />\nsuperior talent and coaching, the Jays will also enjoy the<br />\nconsiderable homefield advantage that Homewood<br />\nprovides. Experience gained from the previous two games<br />\nand the expected return of starting midfielder Brenden<br />\nKelly should bode well for the Jays. Look for a final score<br />\nof 14-7 in favor of the Blue Jays.<br />\nPRINCETON<br />\nSaturday, March 21<br />\nSeries Record: Jays Lead 41-12<br />\n<br />\nHome 2:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nThis year Princeton has been chosen as the Ivy League<br />\nsacrificial lamb. Why this game is scheduled is beyond<br />\nme. By the end of this one the Homewood faithful will<br />\nbe counting off our goals in fives. Everyone should get<br />\nto play in this one as Coach Zimmerman will use this game<br />\nto try out different midfield combinations. This game will<br />\nbe most enjoyable to those of you who were rejected by<br />\nan Ivy League school (and isn't that all of us). Other than<br />\nthat, this game won't offer much in the way of emotional<br />\ninvolvement. Smart money says give the points.

This year's team, though<br />\nnot as strong on paper, should be good enough to reach<br />\nthe Final Four once again. Gone are All-America attackman Rod Marino as well as 11 other Wahoos who scored<br />\na combined 500 career points. This year the team will<br />\nlook to its solid defense and goaltending for leadership.<br />\nBack from last year's finalists is First Team All-America<br />\ngoalie Peter Sheehan. And in seniors Guy Shipley and<br />\nScott Lind and junior Peter McSherry, the Cavaliers have<br />\nthree very big, experienced defensemen. Offensively,<br />\nthough, Virginia is a bit hurting. Freshman Andy Leraus<br />\nand Hopkins transfer Tom Engelke are expected to be their<br />\ntop middies while 24-point man and All-Name team<br />\nmember Chase Monroe will be looked to for scoring at<br />\nthe attack position.<br />\nThis game will match a great Virginia defense against<br />\na very good, and at this point in the schedule, a rapidly<br />\nimproving, Hopkins offense. This should be the Blue Jays'<br />\ntoughest home contest with goals hard to come by for<br />\neither side. Hopkins will be Virginia's first Top Ten Division I opponent of the season and the Cavs should be<br />\npsyched up to show the lacrosse world that their showing<br />\nlast year was no fluke.

In the process they became the first team to be seeded as low as<br />\nfifth to win the title.<br />\nWhat makes Carolina so scary is that they were able<br />\nto accomplish all this in what was essentially a rebuilding<br />\nyear. Losses to graduation were minimal, and they're<br />\nmore than outweighed by the return of their best player,<br />\nmidfielder Joey Seivold. Seivold, a two-time First Team<br />\nAll-America and Team USA player injured his knee in<br />\nthe second game of 1986 and Coach Willie Scroggs decided to redshirt him. In his final year of eligibility, Seivold<br />\nwill team with his younger brother Gary, and junior Pat<br />\nWelsh to give the Heels scoring punch that can match<br />\nanybody's.

His speed and rocket shot killed the<br />\nJays when the two teams met last year, and this season<br />\nhe should repeat as a 1st Team All-America. Also back<br />\nis midfielder Rhett Cavanaugh, yet another All-America.<br />\nOn defense, Simmons will have have to rebuild as two<br />\nstars, Jeff Desko and Kevin Sheehan, are gone. The<br />\nOrange are strong in the nets though, as Jim Gyory came<br />\nout of obscurity to record a 63.8 save percentage and an<br />\nAll-America honor.<br />\nAfter three straight trips to the finals, the Orange were<br />\nderailed in the semis last season by Virginia. This time<br />\naround they should be able to score enough goals to make<br />\nup for a suspect defense, and with their strong senior<br />\nleadership they could easily take it all.<br />\n<br />\nFor what seems like forever, the same four teams have<br />\nbeen making the semifinals in DR !son I Lacrosse.<br />\nHopkins, Syracuse, North Carolina, and Virginia.

Brendan Kelly, a first-teamer last season<br />\nwith 9 goals and 11 assists, is recovering from a knee injury and will likely return in another week. That's the<br />\ngood news. The bad news is that Jack Crawford, a starter<br />\nin 86, tore ligaments in his knee and \u2018k ill he redshiricd<br />\nPromising freshman Mark Dressel broke his foot and is<br />\nalso shelved, and Joe Rzempoluch, last year's standout<br />\nfaceoff specialist is on \"leave\" from school. Maybe he's<br />\nlooking for Chris Wickwire?<br />\nDepth at midfield was a problem for Hopkins last year,<br />\nas Zimmerman did not get the production from his second line that he may have hoped for. Blue Jay midfielders<br />\ncombined for 78 goals in 1985, but only 52 last season,<br />\nnearly half courtesy of Del Dressel.<br />\nTomorrow, and for the rest of the year, Wood will head<br />\nthe first line. After a season filled with defenses geared<br />\nspecifically to stop him, Wood will now get a little room<br />\nto maneuver in and may conceivably improve on his 22<br />\ngoal output. After Wood, though, there are question<br />\nmarks.<br />\nAgainst Syracuse, the other first line midfielders will<br />\nbe senior co-captain Bruce Chanenchuk and sophomore<br />\nJohn Wilkens. Chanenchuk is a heady, solid player who<br />\nplays excellent defense, but has never been a big scorer<br />\n(3 goals, 7 assists). His leadership and speed are a big<br />\nplus. Wilkens didn't see much time as a frosh, but when<br />\nhe did he showed flashes. He's got the size (6'2\", 185<br />\nlbs.) and potential to be a threat with the ball. When Kelly is hale, he'll likely replace Chanenchuk, who would<br />\nmove to the second line.<br />\nThis year's second midfield will be led by Larry<br />\nLedoyen, who performed a similar role in '86. Ledoyen,<br />\na senior, had eight goals in his first year as a Blue Jay,<br />\nbut no assists. Zimmerman expects big things from this<br />\none-time high school superstar this year. Joining Ledoyen<br />\non second midfield, which ideally is on as much as the<br />\nfirst line, are Pat Russell and Joe Diorio. Russell, a<br />\nsophomore, started last season on attack before moving<br />\nto midfield late in the year. \"He can run up and down<br />\nthe field all day,\" says Zimmerman. Diorio has been the<br />\npleasant surprise of camp, coming out of a year's retirement to earn a regular spot.<br />\nThe other three midfielders, John Dressel, Greg Gunning, and Greg Kelly will run a third midfield line. Dressel<br />\nstarted two years ago alongside his brother Del and scored<br />\n9 goals. He sat out with an injury in '86 and is still not<br />\nall the way back.<br />\nGunning will have the important chore of handling<br />\nfaceoffs for the Jays. He was five for eleven last year as<br />\nRzempoluch's backup, but now he must step in and he the.<br />\nman. Rzempoluch came in out of nowhere last year to<br />\nwin 60% of his draws and play an integral role in the Blue<br />\nJay success, and it is hoped the sophomore Gunning can<br />\ndo the same.<br />\nDEFENSE<br />\nHow inexperienced are the Blue defensemen? Well,<br />\nSteve Mitchell is the only one that suited up the last time<br />\nHopkins played in a national title game,just two seasons<br />\nago. Of the ten listed defensemen, four are walk-ons who<br />\nhave been standouts in other sports at Hopkins but have<br />\nplayed little lacrosse.<br />\nMitchell, who led the basketball team in scoring twice<br />\nand the football team in receiving once, is among the best<br />\nathletes in NCAA lacrosse. He took up the sport full time<br />\nlast year and made honorable mention as a rope man. This<br />\nyear though, he'll start out on the close defense, along<br />\nwith sophomores Dave Pietramala and Greg Lilly.<br />\nPietramala (6'3\", 190 lbs.) missed much of last year with<br />\nmono, but when he cracked the lineup late in the season<br />\nhe played like the future superstar he's been touted to be.<br />\nLilly also didn't play much as a frosh, but has looked sharp<br />\npre-season scrimmages.<br />\nJames DeTommaso, John's younger brother, saw a lot<br />\nof time coming off the bench last year and excelled, but<br />\nhas been slowed this spring with a bad knee. If he can<br />\ncome in and be the force his brother was, something he<br />\nmay be up to, than it will free Zimmerman to move Mitchell to the rope.<br />\nWith a rule limiting teams to five long sticks, Zimmerman had to use a midfielder, Damon Stewart, on the rope<br />\nunit that formerly was all defensemen. Stewart thrived<br />\n<br />\non the role and will assume it again this year. He'll likely team with senior Mike Webster and freshman Dave<br />\nHowland, although Mitchell and sophomore Steve Ciccarone may also be called upon.<br />\nOther defensemen are sophomore Chip Dates, and<br />\nWalk-ons Eric Sham. Nils N, oiiiip\u2018 ail. and Cnri,<br />\nChirieleison.

The Barnstormers have been a part of the<br />\ncampus for well over six decades.<br />\nTheir name comes from the Merrick Barn, which houses their office full of posters, props and<br />\ncostumes. During the usual<br />\nschool year, their schedule includes 2 mainstage plays (professionally directed plays in the L/V<br />\nRoom), a mainstage musical, 3<br />\nstudio plays (student-directed<br />\nplays in the Barn, like Spoon<br />\nRiver Anthology), and one production called \"The Freshman<br />\nOne-Acts.\" The One-Acts represent what is at the heart of the<br />\nBarnstormers: getting people involved in student theater.<br />\nFreshman are cast in five or six<br />\none-act plays which are produced and directed by upperclass<br />\nBarnstormers. This past fall.<br />\nplays by Christopher Durang,<br />\nTennesee Williams and Harod<br />\nPinter were among those<br />\npresented. Said Barnstormer<br />\nVice-President Rich Bigelow, the<br />\nproducer behind the Freshman<br />\nOne-Acts, \"I think the best<br />\ntheater that has been done here<br />\nhas been directed by students.\"<br />\n\"We try to provide the most<br />\nopportunities for the most people,\" said Barnstormer President<br />\nCarol Gerry. \"While trying to<br />\nprovide entertainment for the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins community.\" This ineludes deeper, more experimental productions like Gerry's own<br />\nSpoon River Anthology, as well as<br />\nlighter fare, like this year's<br />\nmusical, A Celebration of<br />\n<br />\nApplause.<br />\n\"Celebration is a tribute to the<br />\npast ten years of Hopkins<br />\nmusicals, written and directed by<br />\nLinda Brody, a professional<br />\ndirector who has worked with<br />\n<br />\nsummer StOC k and dinner<br />\ntheaters.\" Vice-President Pietro<br />\nPiccinini is producing the<br />\nmusical, which has 32 singers<br />\nfrom Hopkins. Goucher and<br />\nPeabody performing highlights<br />\n<br />\nfrom Cats and Applause and other<br />\nmusicals. \"This is the most<br />\ntalented group I've seen in a<br />\nHopkins musical,\" said Piccinini.<br />\nThe muscial will run during<br />\nSpring Fair, as well as April 24,<br />\n25, 26\u2014Homecoming Weekend.<br />\nOn April 25, for the first time,<br />\nthere will be an \"Alumni night\"<br />\nincluding the musical and a<br />\ncocktail party in the Glass<br />\nPavillion. Will the Barnstormers<br />\nmake the foray into politicking?<br />\n\"Public relations is the main<br />\nthing,\" assured Piccinini.<br />\n\"Public relations within<br />\nHopkins is important,\" said<br />\nGerry. Through PR the group has<br />\nbeen able to accomodate its different tendencies. Two directions<br />\nwithin the group give the Barnstormers range and vitality: many<br />\npeople are drawn to professional<br />\nproductions like Arsenic and Old<br />\nLace or the musical, while others<br />\nare interested in studio theater<br />\nlike Alex Willis' Squirrels or<br />\nSpoon River. \"We are constantly trying to expand our range,\"<br />\nsaid Gerry.<br />\nPlans for expansion include a<br />\ncomedy improvisation troupe,<br />\nand an \"Actors' Lab\" that Gerry<br />\nhopes will be a workshoporiented series presenting studentwritten plays. While the Actor's<br />\nLab would provide participation<br />\nfor actors who don't get involved in mainstage productions, the<br />\nimprov group would spark interest in audiences not normally<br />\ninterested in formal \"theater.\"<br />\nSometimes the two directions<br />\nwithin the Barnstormers meet:<br />\nthis weekend and next they are<br />\npresenting a mainstage production of The Real Thing.

As a last gift to her six<br />\ndaughters, she is leaving them a<br />\n\"Legacy Quilt.\" \"You'll see a<br />\nthread of my life in there from<br />\ntime to time,\" she says with<br />\ngood, folksy charm. Suddenly the<br />\ncast starts singing, \"Pieces of<br />\nlife, pieces of women . . \" For<br />\nthe women in the patriarchal<br />\nsociety of the Old West, quilting<br />\nreally was pieces of their lives. It<br />\nwas a way to express their inner<br />\nemotions and thoughts on life and<br />\nhistory.<br />\nAnd what a history it was.<br />\nThrough starvation, blizzards and<br />\nloneliness, the seven actresses<br />\nrtray three enerations of<br />\n<br />\npioneer men and women. The<br />\nLegacy Quilt is made up of<br />\n\"blocks\" and each block tells a<br />\ndifferent story. The first block<br />\ntells of the \"rocky road west\"<br />\nthat Sarah's parents overcame<br />\nwhen the prairies were first being settled. The second block tells<br />\nof the crude and often dangerous<br />\nmakeshift homes the first settlers<br />\nlived in.<br />\n<br />\nThe third block deals with<br />\nchildhood, now that the people<br />\nhave settled down with their environment. One girl tells of her<br />\nencounter with \"the curse.\"<br />\nAnother girl talks about her<br />\nsister, a much better quilter than<br />\nshe is, and how she eventually exacts her revenge. With these two<br />\nmonologues (from Tracey<br />\nMeyers and Leisa Kelley, respectively) the play hits its stride. The<br />\naudience laughs genuinely and<br />\nfalls silent at other times\u2014the<br />\nmagic of theater has been<br />\nachieved.<br />\n<br />\nsing-songy, like the method of<br />\nquilting. \"Children Come Thread<br />\nthe Needle\" is very effective, as<br />\nit describes the down-and-through<br />\nand down-and-through method of<br />\nstitching. And the singing is for<br />\nthe most part admirable, although<br />\n<br />\nRosemary Polen seems to be the<br />\nonly one whose voice is<br />\nremarkable.<br />\nAll in all, Quilters has the kind<br />\nof charm one would expect from<br />\na good, old-fashioned, handmade<br />\nquilt. It's a bit cruder than most<br />\n<br />\nTheatre Hopkins productions, but<br />\nthat is the price you pay for variety in theater. And all those people in the audience laughing<br />\ndidn't seem to mind.<br />\n<br />\nectre<br />\nKIns<br />\nKaye Dies, Era Ends<br />\n<br />\nThe play goes on, revealing the<br />\nlife stories as each block of the<br />\nLegacy Quilt is revealed, until the<br />\n16th and final block is set. By<br />\nthen the cast has enacted baptism,<br />\nmarriage, and fires. Suzanne<br />\nPratt's staging is inventive and<br />\nsimultaneously somber and eyecatching. The acting is earnest,<br />\nand especially good are Kelley<br />\nand Irons as the mother.<br />\nThe music, by Barbara<br />\nDamashek is a mixture of Country, Folk and Native American.<br />\nIt fits just right as played by Chris<br />\nNorman, Laurie Harper, and<br />\nRobin Bullock. The songs are<br />\n<br />\nOn Tuesday morning, March<br />\n4, the world renowned comedian<br />\nand humanitarian Danny Kaye<br />\npassed away. Having been one 01<br />\nHollywood's brightest stars in the<br />\n40's and 50's, Mr. Kaye won an<br />\nhonorary Oscar, a . Kennedy<br />\nCenter Medal, and unanimous<br />\npraise for his work with<br />\nUNICEF.<br />\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1913,<br />\nKaye at first aspired to be a doctor. But money was scarce, and<br />\nin the Depression he started performing at parties and night<br />\nclubs. In 1941 came his first big<br />\nbreak, a cameo in the Broadway<br />\nproduction Lady in the Dark.<br />\nKaye delighted the audience with<br />\nhis patter song, \"Tchaikovsky,\"<br />\nin which he rattled off the names<br />\nof 50 Russian composers in half<br />\na minute.

In 1943 he achieved<br />\nstardom a a beleaguered soldier<br />\nin Up In Arms. He stayed in the<br />\nwest and went on to star in such<br />\nfamous film comedies as Wonder<br />\nMan, The Secret Life of Walter<br />\nMitty, and The Inspector General.<br />\nIn 1953 he played his most<br />\nfamous part, the kind-hearted<br />\nstoryteller Hans Christian<br />\nAndersen.<br />\nKaye became famous playing<br />\nthe good-natured milquetoast who<br />\nwins out in the end. He was good<br />\nnatured in real life as well, raising over $5 million for Symphony<br />\nMusicians and working as an<br />\nhonorary Ambassador for<br />\nUNICEF. His greatest joy, that<br />\nof entertaining children, was evident by the many children who<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nappeared on his TV series, \"The<br />\nDanny Kaye Show\".<br />\nA man of many talents, Kaye<br />\nwas an avid fan of music and<br />\nsports. He helped start the Seattle Mariners, and was also an excellent conductor. What Zubin<br />\nMehta called \"innate musical<br />\ntalent\" helped him conduct many<br />\norchestras, including the New<br />\nYork Philharmonic. His wife, the<br />\npianist-composer Sylvia Fine,<br />\nhelped write many of his patter<br />\nsongs.<br />\nAlthough Danny Kaye is gone,<br />\nthe laughter is not dead. His goal<br />\nwas to make people laugh, and he<br />\nsucceeded. \"I never wanted to<br />\nplay Hamlet,\" he said. By seeing<br />\nthe films and old TV shows that<br />\ndisplayed his energy and zany<br />\nwit, we can enjoy Kaye's gift for<br />\nlaughter for years to come.<br />\n<br />\nEntertaining Barnstormers Put Out<br />\nContinued from Page 21<br />\nDead about a playwright(Henry)<br />\ntrying to find a place for himself<br />\nin modern society; it is a light,<br />\nentertaining show that, through<br />\nStoppard's skill, makes serious<br />\npoints about love, art and politics.<br />\n\"We selected The Real Thing<br />\nto move slowly into more comple material,\" said Gerry.<br />\n\"Eventually I'd like to see the<br />\norganization do Cat on a Hot Tin<br />\nRoof for our mainstage.\" The<br />\nproduction of the Stoppard play,<br />\ndue to open March 6 at 8 pm in<br />\nLevering Hall's L/V Room, is<br />\ndirected by Chappel Aldridge.<br />\nAldridge, who has worked in<br />\nD.C. as a stage manager and<br />\ndirector, sees The Real Thing as<br />\na song in dialogue. \"Boy meets<br />\ngirl, boy loses girl, boy gets<br />\ngirl.\" It's a classic rock and roll<br />\nlove story, enhanced by the incidental music which is the<br />\nMonkees, Turtles and Procol<br />\nHarum that Henry loves.<br />\n\"When you laugh at this play,<br />\nyou're really laughing,\" said<br />\nGerry. \"And the cast is wonder-<br />\n<br />\nful. When you have veterans like<br />\nChat Ewing (\"Squirrels\") and<br />\nJeremy Golub (\"Arsenic and Old<br />\nLace\") in the supporting cast,<br />\nyou can't go wrong. The<br />\nchemistry between the actors is<br />\nastounding.\" More astounding is<br />\nthe skill of those who are not<br />\nveterans. The actor playing<br />\nHenry, Nathan Long, has had<br />\nvery little experience on the<br />\nstage. Yet Carol was impressed<br />\nwith his natural presence. \"It's<br />\nthe most naturally talented group<br />\nof actors I've ever worked with<br />\nat Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe rehearsals are over. On<br />\nMarch 6, 7, and 8 they will prove just how funny the play is, and<br />\njust how the Barnstormers have<br />\nput the right words in the right<br />\norder. \"There are people who get<br />\ntogether to do political stuff, and<br />\nothers who do social stuff,\" said<br />\nRich Bigelow. \"We're a bunch of<br />\npeople that want to get together<br />\nand do theater.\" So the Barnstormers go on, pushing forward,<br />\ntrying to nudge the world a little.<br />\n<br />\n\faWAY:BLM1inaleiC<br />\n'N.:\\:\\.1<br />\n..<br />\n\\<br />\n.\" .<br />\n,\\<br />\n.\" ..'\"\\-\"N.<br />\n..1N<br />\n.\" .<br />\n.'\\,..<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n\\<br />\n.- .<br />\n\"<br />\n\\<br />\n.<br />\n.' ,'N.%\\:\\<br />\n.<br />\n.-\\.,<br />\n<br />\n-1..\"\\..\"\\--N...'\"\\1<br />\n.' .<br />\n\\<br />\n..<br />\n.'\" N<br />\n,' -1\\<br />\n.

Well,<br />\nmaybe not as much as a decade<br />\nago when the pre-med population<br />\nhovered around 60-65%. as compared to today's 30-35cA but there<br />\nis no doubting that much of<br />\nHopkins' character is derived<br />\nfrom these ambitious preprofessionals. The academics,<br />\nsocial life, and extracurriculars<br />\nare all affected by the pre-med's<br />\nparticipation (or lack of it), a fact<br />\nthat the student body and even the<br />\nAdministration seem to be overly aware of. Where else in the<br />\ncountry would the Student Council plan social events around the<br />\norganic chemistry exam schedule<br />\nor take care not to let a Spring Fair<br />\nconflict with the MCAT's?<br />\nThis week we present the first<br />\nof a two-part article on the state<br />\nof a pre-medical education at<br />\nHopkins for the benefit of those<br />\nwho are looking at it from the<br />\noutside and as well as those who<br />\nare looking to the future in<br />\nHopkins' rigorous preparation for<br />\nmedical school. First we shall examine the coursework the<br />\npre-meds must complete by the<br />\nend of their senior year and how<br />\nthey and their professors feel<br />\nabout it. Next week we shall<br />\ndelve deeper into the pre-med as<br />\na person, attempting to find personal and expert opinion on the<br />\nmotivations and possible<br />\ndownfalls during their career at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe pre-med freshman at<br />\nHopkins has it relatively easy his<br />\nfirst semester here compared to<br />\nmost universities. That is, if he<br />\ndoes not have advanced standing.<br />\nNearly overwhelmingly, premeds from sophomore to senior<br />\nyear praise the pass-fail first<br />\nsemester at Hopkins as a great if<br />\nnot wholly necessary institution.<br />\nMany feel that the shock of transition from high school to<br />\nHopkins would be intensified so<br />\ngreatly if the first semester was<br />\ngraded that we would lose half the<br />\npre-meds right then. Counselors<br />\nequally praise the pass-fail<br />\nsemester, but they're quick to<br />\npoint out that, \"the pass-fail<br />\nsemester is not just for premeds. . . in general, any major at<br />\nHopkins is rigorous and students<br />\nmust be given some adaption time<br />\nto learn to keep up.\"<br />\nMost people at Hopkins are<br />\nquite familiar with the courses required of the pre-med, it is hard<br />\nto go through four years without<br />\nat least one of your friends coming up and complaining about his<br />\ncourses. For those that need to be<br />\nreminded, here's a summary of<br />\nthe Hopkins pre-med curriculum.<br />\nA freshman almost always starts<br />\nout his career with \"Introductory<br />\nChemistry,\u2014 a general survey<br />\ncourse of chemistry that all<br />\nscience and nearly all engineering students must take. The stress<br />\nis on qualitative and quantitative<br />\nchemistry, and one learns all the<br />\nchemistry\u2014<br />\nof<br />\ntools<br />\nstoichiometry, ionic and covalent<br />\nbonding, thermodynamics, acidbase chemistry, and the like. Its<br />\n<br />\ncompanion laboratory course<br />\ndeals with much the same<br />\nmaterial and students must spend<br />\nthree hours a week doing experiments on a wide range of<br />\ntopics in chemistry ranging from<br />\ntitrations to calorimetry. This<br />\ncourse introduces students to the<br />\nscientific method and requires a<br />\nsummary of investigations in the<br />\nform of lab reports. These two<br />\ncourses and their content are pretty much similar to courses taught<br />\nto freshmen pre-meds around the<br />\nnation. The only difference is that<br />\nat Hopkins the lecturer for the<br />\n<br />\ndo with the chemistry of carbon,<br />\nbut it is the more complex nature<br />\nof the reactions it can undergo<br />\nthat slips up students. The vast<br />\namount of material, the<br />\nmemoriiation. and the development of a certain mode of thought<br />\nnecessary to approach the problems encountered in the course<br />\nall require vast amount of time<br />\nand effort that few students are<br />\nused to giving prior to the course.<br />\nPractice and patience are key to<br />\nsuccess in the course and without<br />\nit, students will find the theory of<br />\nreactions unmaterable. The<br />\nlaboratory course involves putting into practice some of the<br />\nreactions that were taught in the<br />\nclassroom. The reactions are long<br />\n<br />\nthe other sciences is popular as<br />\nwell and a precious few even try<br />\nto major in a social science and<br />\nhumanity, taking all of the above<br />\nas electives. Diversity is possible<br />\nat many levels of a pre-med's<br />\neducation here at Hopkins.<br />\nThe courses a pre-med<br />\nfreshman takes aside from the required ones mentioned above all<br />\nboil down to what a certain person enjoys and is interested in.<br />\nQuestions such as how hard a<br />\nprofessor is, how difficult a<br />\ncourse is, and how much time is<br />\ndevoted to a course therefore cannot be answered simply. The<br />\nwide range of courses and the fact<br />\nthat some students have the knack<br />\nfor chemistry, while others have<br />\n<br />\n\"The further removed from the<br />\ncourse[Mol Cell]the more students<br />\nappreciate it.\"<br />\n\u2014Dr. Bessman<br />\n<br />\ncourse has probably done some<br />\nreknowned research in the field<br />\nof chemistry and perhaps can provide a more nuanced presentation<br />\nof the material.<br />\nGeneral Physics is another<br />\ncourse that freshmen pre-meds<br />\noften take, yet many of them<br />\npostpone it to their junior year,<br />\npresumably to free up their<br />\nfreshman schedules to fulfill<br />\nlanguage or English requirements. This course is divided into two semi-independent<br />\nparts\u2014mechanics and fluid and<br />\nsolid-state dynamics in the first<br />\nsemester, and electricity and<br />\nmagnetism in the second. The<br />\nlectures are theoretical and the<br />\nwork consists mainly of problemsolving. Again, pre-meds and<br />\nengineering students comprise the<br />\npopulation of this class. The pace<br />\nof this course\u2014two chapters a<br />\nweek\u2014is fast and students must<br />\nthrough<br />\nweekly<br />\nsuffer<br />\nhomeworks to be turned in at 8<br />\nam conference sections, where<br />\nperiodic quizzes are also given.<br />\n<br />\nand often tedious to perform, and<br />\noften nervewracking as well since<br />\nthe course grade is based primarily on purity and yield of the compounds you produced. Scheduled<br />\nfor 6 and a half hours of class<br />\ntime, most students put an<br />\naverage of 8 to 9 hours in the lab<br />\na week.<br />\nThe second semester of<br />\nsophomore year is when the premed begins Molecular Cell<br />\nBiology, an extremely wideranging course covering topics<br />\nfrom biochemistry to cell<br />\nphysiology, to microscopic<br />\ntechnique. The course is unique<br />\nsince it is taught by at least 8 different professors throughout the<br />\nyear, and students must get used<br />\nto each's teaching style and emphasis. Testing consists of grueling 2 hour exams that are often<br />\non the scale of 15 pages or more.<br />\nThe laboratory course exposes<br />\nthe student to modern biological<br />\ntechnique, with a concentration in<br />\nspectophotometric assays. Electrophoresis, microscopy, enzyme<br />\nkinetics, and a host of specialties<br />\nof biology are shown to the<br />\nstudents by their teaching<br />\nassistants, each in charge of about<br />\n<br />\nit for literature makes defining the<br />\ndifficulties of freshman year impossible. Fortunately, the premed requirements include a broad<br />\nrange of courses so that it is<br />\nhighly probable a pre-med takes<br />\nat least a few courses in which he<br />\ncan enjoy and excel.<br />\nDr. Gryder's \"Intro Chem\"<br />\nclass, however, seems to play a<br />\nsignificant role in the life of many<br />\nHopkins pre-meds because it is<br />\nthe first requirement that most<br />\npre-meds fulfill. Freshman opinion of the course is varied, ranging from \"his reasoning is not<br />\nhard to follow\" all the way down<br />\nto \"his theoretical approach<br />\nmakes chemistry unbearable.\"<br />\nReflecting not only on his course<br />\nbut the pre-med curriculum as a<br />\nwhole, Dr. Gryder feels that the<br />\nbasic requirements are \"the bare<br />\nminimum of sciences that a doctor should comprehend before<br />\nentering his profession.\" When<br />\nasked about the relevance of<br />\nhumanities courses to pre-med requirements, Dr. Gryder replied<br />\n<br />\n\"Humanities reflect how you are as<br />\na person. They are especially essential for doctors...in clinical and<br />\nprimary health care fields.\"<br />\n\u2014Dr. Gryder<br />\nCalculus, though not specifically required by many medical<br />\nschools, is a corequisite for<br />\nPhysics and it is highly recommended for advanced scientific<br />\nwork, so freshmen manage to<br />\nsqueeze this course into their<br />\nschedule as well. Again, fast<br />\npace, weekly homeworks.<br />\nCome sophomore year,<br />\nstudents receive the double punch<br />\nof premed courses\u2014Organic<br />\nChemistry and Molecular Cell<br />\nBiology and their associated labs.<br />\nOrganic Chemistry as any<br />\nHopkins graduate knows has to<br />\n<br />\na dozen students. The investment<br />\nin time for this course varies with<br />\nrespect to experiment and TA's,<br />\nsome weeks only a few hours are<br />\nnecessary, others, one must remain to nightfall.<br />\nAdd to these courses a year of<br />\nEnglish, two or three semesters<br />\not a foreigh language to complete<br />\nrequirements for a major, and<br />\nthen like all students, a potpourri<br />\nof courses to fill out distribution<br />\nrequirements. Usually pre-meds<br />\nare biology or behavioral biology<br />\nmajors (usually about a half to<br />\ntwo-thirds), although majoring in<br />\n<br />\nAs a whole, Dr. Gryder feels<br />\nthat the medical field should not<br />\nbe regarded and treated as a simple profession, but as a broad<br />\nvariety of different medically<br />\noriented fields. If he could change<br />\nthe whole pre-medical training<br />\nsytstem, he would train different<br />\npre-meds (future pediatricians,<br />\nbiomedical engineers, surgzons,<br />\netc.) differently with appropriate<br />\nrequirements.<br />\nCasting a final look at freshman<br />\npre-meds as a whole, a small<br />\ngroup stands out\u2014those who have<br />\nskipped Intro Chem with AP<br />\ncredit and so they elect to take<br />\nOrganic Chemistry in their<br />\nfreshman year. That these<br />\nstudents have enough AP credit<br />\nto force them into sophomore<br />\nstanding takes away the luxury of<br />\na pass-fail first semester. Despite<br />\nall the difficulties, there are still<br />\nstudents wh3 describe their<br />\nacademic regimens as \"not too<br />\nbad,\" while others feel a great<br />\ndeal of pressure.<br />\nSophomore pre-meds love to<br />\ncomplain about their courses.<br />\nMost everyone takes Organic<br />\nChemistry and Mole Cell at this<br />\ntime in order to ensure proper<br />\npreparation for the MCAT's n<br />\nthe spring of their junior year<br />\nOrganic Chemistry seems to be<br />\nthe root of all evil to some, \"It<br />\nrequires endless work, it's impossible to compete,\" complained one while others claimed that<br />\nit's not as bad as it's reputed to<br />\nbe: \"It's a lot of work, but if you<br />\ndo it, you'll succeed.\" Particularly vehement complaints are<br />\nregistered against those who audit<br />\nthe course during the summer or<br />\nperhaps even in freshman year to<br />\nget a feel for it, and then take the<br />\ncourse as a sophomore and inflate<br />\nthe exam averages. \"It's<br />\nridiculous,\" said one senior, \"it's<br />\ncomparable to letting people<br />\nfluent in Spanish take an introductory Spanish course.\"<br />\nOthers lamented, \"If you're not<br />\nthat good in chemistry you feel<br />\nthat you practically have to take<br />\na primer course before<br />\nsophomore year.\"<br />\nMole Cell was also the basis for<br />\na barrage of complaints, but the<br />\ncriticisms were very different.<br />\nThe primary one was the fact in<br />\ncontrast to most major courses,<br />\nthere were no exams on file in the<br />\nreserve room.

When the dust<br />\ncleared, however, the big Yale<br />\nCup\u2014symbol of conference<br />\n3-weapon supremacy\u2014was found<br />\nreposing safely for the fourth consecutive year in its accustomed<br />\nplace, the trophy case in the<br />\nAthletic Center fencing room.<br />\nLast year's team shattered all<br />\nconference records and won in a<br />\nwalk, but this year's was a war<br />\nof attrition. Although the Blue<br />\nJays never relinquished the lead<br />\nfrom their first bout until the end<br />\nof the tourney, the margin was so<br />\nclose\u2014varying between only two<br />\nand six bouts all day\u2014that the<br />\ntension never let up and could<br />\nhave been cut with a knife. The<br />\nHop's closest rivals\u2014William<br />\nand Mary and Vassar, both of<br />\nwhom had beaten the swordsmen<br />\nby two bouts in dual meets this<br />\nyear\u2014played leapfrog with one<br />\nanother all day trying to catch the<br />\nhigh-flying Blue Jays, but neither<br />\ncould mount a sustained effort<br />\nand the final tally showed<br />\nHopkins at the top of the heap by<br />\nthe razor-thin margin of two<br />\nbouts.<br />\nThe tournament is fenced on 9<br />\nstrips simultaneously, 3 strips per<br />\nweapon. In each weapon all the<br />\nno. 1 men fence a complete<br />\nround-robin pool on the \"A\"<br />\nstrip while the no. 2 and 3 men<br />\ndo the same on the \"B\" and \"C\"<br />\nstrips. A team's total wins(A, B,<br />\nand C pools) in each weapon<br />\ndetermine the team winners in<br />\n<br />\nthat weapon, while the team with<br />\nthe lleq record in all three'<br />\nweapons takes home the Yale<br />\nCup. As always, Hopkins' almost<br />\nperfect balance (22 wins in foil,<br />\n19 in epee, 19 in sabre) was the<br />\nkey. Army won the foil team title and Stevens took the sabre,<br />\nwhile William and Mary captured<br />\nthe team epee crown\u2014but in each<br />\nweapon the Jays finished a close<br />\nsecond, giving them the overall<br />\n3-weapon title.<br />\nThe foil team continued its success on the strip this past Saturday by contributing 22 victories<br />\ntoward the MAC title. Dave<br />\nCohen led the way with 10 victories in the C pool. Craig Chun<br />\nand Chai Kulsakdinun added 6<br />\nwins each. Cohen moved up to<br />\nthe finals and finished in 6th<br />\nplace; Chun and Kulsakdinun<br />\nmissed going up by narrow<br />\nmargins. The foil team finished<br />\n2nd in the foil team competition<br />\nbehind Army. But the team was<br />\nsatisfied with the 3-weapon<br />\ntrophy when Cohen won his last<br />\nbout and help the Blue Jays clinch<br />\nthe title. This year has proven to<br />\nbe a successful year for the foil<br />\nteam, which had a 14-6 record.<br />\nSenior Chun (44-18) will be leaving and will be missed.

Nelson commented that it is<br />\nalways tough to have a strong<br />\nyear when there is so much new<br />\nblood coming in, but on the other<br />\nhand it provides a good foundation on which a strong program<br />\ncan be built. Many of the new<br />\nplayers saw a large amount of<br />\nplaying time.

Commenting<br />\non the stats, Nelson said that \"to<br />\nhave a record of 15 wins or better, a team has to shoot at least<br />\n50 percent from the field, and<br />\naround 70 percent from the line,<br />\nand score about 75 points per<br />\ngame. \"We fell a little short of<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nOn an individual level,<br />\ngraduating senior Chris Wasson,<br />\nwho was named an academic AllAmerica, led in the total points<br />\ndepartment with 341, averaging<br />\n14.2 per game.

What are your qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nMy qualifications for Young Trustee<br />\nare: Co-Chairman, 1986 Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium (Religion &amp;<br />\nPolitics: The Separation of Church and<br />\nState), Student Assistant to the Dean of<br />\nStudents (1985-1987), Chairman,<br />\nBuildings and Grounds Committee of the<br />\nStudent Council, (1984-1985), Tutor,<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Tutorial Project<br />\n(1984-1985).<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nAs a Young Trustee, I would like to<br />\npromote an attitude on the part of the<br />\nBoard that takes into account the concerns of students more closely when<br />\nestablishing broad University policy. The<br />\ndenial of tenure to an outstanding<br />\nteacher, the opening of school when<br />\nthere is a foot of snow on the ground,<br />\nthe arrest of students for merely sitting<br />\non a quad are all examples of bad decisions that were made in part, I believe,<br />\nbecause students' views were not taken<br />\ninto account when broad policies were<br />\nestablished.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br /><br />\nCandidates for Young Trustee were asked to submit responses to four questions posed by the NewsLetter.

Simple acts of expression arouse anger and<br />\nviolence instead of debate and discourse.<br />\nIf this university is to live up to its goal<br />\nof fostering and promoting the quest for<br />\nknowledge, then an atmosphere must be<br />\nestablished that will allow learning and<br />\nresearch to be conducted without fear of<br />\nreprisal or denunciation. I believe the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider the<br />\npresent climate at Homewood as a<br />\nserious threat to the function of the<br />\nUniversity as a center of learning and<br />\nresearch.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI plan to stay in the area for a least two<br />\nor three years, possibly serving in<br />\ngovernment in Washington or Annap-\"s.<br />\nAfter that time, I will decide if I want<br />\nto go to graduate school or law school.<br />\nI do not believe my plans will in any way<br />\naffect the duties of a Young Trustee.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nAndrew Chun<br />\nI AN hat are sour qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nI have served this institution from<br />\nseveral perspectives and believe that<br />\nthrough these positions. I have developed<br />\na very wide view of it. As a Trustee I<br />\nbelieve that it will be essential to have<br />\nsuch a view. I have served as parent ambassador, student advisor, representative<br />\nto Student Council for two years. Chairman of the Parents Program for Orientaton '86. tutor in the Tutorial Program,<br />\nBook Store representative, founding,<br />\nmember of the Faculty-Student Interaction program and Treasurer of the Black<br />\nStudents Union. I have also served as student representative on numerous administrative committees. I have also<br />\nworked in the library and fin the S.C.S.<br />\nI believe that I have also not lost contact<br />\nwith the undergrads and their concerns,<br />\nas several of the present student leaders<br />\nhave.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nTo serve this institution to the best of<br />\nmy ability and hopefully have some fun<br />\nalso.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br /><br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nMany issues which affect the<br />\nundergraduates have been or are being<br />\nconsidered, including Wolman/McCoy.<br />\na Student Union, Divestment, recruitment of excellent faculty and students.<br />\nand the funding of our expenses. One<br />\nissue which I feel should he looked into<br />\nthough is the focus which this institution<br />\nplaces on the students (includng grads.<br />\nand meds.). When one sees how long it<br />\nhas taken to do any of the above, to improve the security, when one looks at the<br />\nfaculty members which are not being<br />\npromoted. etc., one sometimes wonders.<br />\nI believe that more communication and<br />\na more receptive attitude may help<br />\nchange the wide gap which exists between those who run this school and those<br />\nwho ARE this school.<br />\n4.

As the YT's arc flown in for<br />\nmeetings I do not envision the distance<br />\nbeing a problem and even as a medical<br />\nstudent I am so organized that this will<br />\nnot be an obstacle.<br /><br />\nLoren Heilweil<br />\n1. What are your qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nI've been at Hopkins for four years and<br />\nI care a great deal about this school. I<br />\nam therefore more than willing to put in<br />\nthe large amount of time it takes to be<br />\nan effective Young Trustee. I have not<br />\nplayed a major role in running the Student Council machinery as many of my<br />\nopponents have. I feel this is a plus. During my years here, I have gained a<br />\nperspective very much in tune with the<br />\nlarge majority of Hopkins students.<br />\nAlso, since I plan to become a physician, I don't view the Board of Trustees<br />\na place to make connections or as a<br />\nspringboard for my own careerist ambitions. I will therefore not be afraid to<br />\nmake the Trustees aware of student opinions and views.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nAll of us want to see Hopkins succeed;<br />\nto stay academically and financially<br />\nstrong so our degrees are worth<br />\nsomething. To bring the branches of<br />\nHopkins closer together and make<br />\nHopkins a great place to be. I share and<br />\nam willing to work for these goals. So,<br />\nhowever, is every other Trustee. These<br />\ngoals will be met regardless of who the<br />\nYoung Trustee is.<br />\nMy main objective as Young Trustee<br />\ntherefore is to, in principle as well as<br />\npractice, bring a student's point of view<br />\nto the Board. To make sure the Trustees<br />\nunderstand how their decisions affect<br />\nstudents. I also want to stop the blatant<br />\ndisregard for undergraduate interests that<br />\nseems to be characteristic of the Board.<br />\nOne example being the lack of commitment in improving undergraduate<br /><br />\nhousing.<br />\nAnother objective important to me is<br />\nto keep the undergraduates informed of<br /><br />\nall I possibly can about the issues before<br />\nthe Board. I would do this through posted<br />\nnotices or periodic bulletins in the NewsLetter. I would plan, if chosen, to keep<br />\nin touch with the undergraduate population at Hopkins, something not done by<br />\nany recent Young Trustee.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nTuition is the most important<br />\nundergraduate issue facing the Board today. I will do my best to halt or at least<br />\nslow the rise of this monster. I will encourage the Board to seek other avenues<br />\nto a balanced budget.<br />\nAnother important issue is criteria for<br />\nfaculty promotions, especially in light of<br />\nthe recent denial of one to Dr. David, and<br />\nthe denial of tenure a couple of years ago<br />\nto Dr. Tu, an excellent math professor.<br />\nWhile I realize that the Board does not<br />\nmake faculty tenure decisions directly,<br />\nit is responsible for shaping the overall<br />\npolicies of the University, which lead to<br />\nthese decisions.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nThe first year after graduation, I will<br />\ntake a job in the Baltimore area to earn<br />\nmoney for medical school. This flexible<br />\nyear will allow a lot of time for performance of Young Trustees' duties. Afterwards, though I will be in medical<br />\nschool, I will give as much time as<br />\nnecessary to the Young Trustee position.<br /><br />\nYoung Trustee Candidates Speak on Issues<br />\nPaul Kadri<br />\nMary Hiatt<br />\n1. What are your qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nIn the three and a half years that I have<br />\nbeen at Hopkins, I have taken advantage<br />\nof many opportunities to involve myself<br />\nin campus life. Through these experiences, I have gained insight into the<br />\nideals and goals which guide the University, as well as the constraints which it<br />\nfaces. My experiences include working<br />\nwith students, as well as administrators<br />\nand other members of the University<br />\ncommunity, and I think that this exposure<br />\nto many different concerns and responsibilities would be valuable to me as a<br />\nmember of the Board.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nIn terms of what! hope to accomplish,<br />\nI have to say that there is not one goal<br />\nor thing that I have set out to achieve by<br />\nbeing a Young Trustee. My definition of<br />\naccomplishment is to serve the Board and<br />\nthe University by fulfilling the role of a<br />\ntrustee. To be involved with the business<br />\nof the University, to be able to influence<br />\npositively the future direction of the<br />\nUniversity, to be committed to Hopkins<br />\nbeyond being an undergraduate\u2014these<br />\nare the things which I consider accomplishments for a Young Trustee.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br /><br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nThere are two issues which I think that<br />\nthe Board should address in the next<br />\nyear. The first one can be described as<br />\nthe quality of undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudent life. This covers lots of areas, the<br />\nmost important being student housing<br />\nand student activities issues. The second<br />\nissue concerns the climate of the University. By this, I mean the lack of tolerance<br />\nfor different opinions, beliefs, and,values<br />\nwhich has recently characterized this environment. Obviously I am not a<br />\nrepresentative of student interests alone,<br />\nbut I think that these are issues which<br />\ndirectly affect the University's ability to<br />\nfulfill its responsibilities to students, as<br />\nwell as to all members of its community.<br />\n4. What are your plans after<br />\ngraduating and how will those plans<br />\naffect your ability to perform the<br />\nduties of a Young Trustee?<br />\nI am in the process of searching for a<br />\njob. With any luck, I will have found<br />\nsomething by graduation. Most likely, I<br />\nwill be in the New York area, or possibly<br />\nWashington, D.C. In either case, I don't<br />\nthink that distance will hinder my ability to perform the duties of Young<br />\nTrustee.<br /><br />\nMark Komisky<br />\n1. What are your qualifications for being a Young Trustee?<br />\nAs a student leader on this campus, it<br />\nhas been my duty to know and understand the concerns of students and to act<br />\non them in a reasonable and responsible<br />\nmanner. As President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, I have worked with students<br />\nfrom many divisions of Johns Hopkins<br />\nand feel I know the common needs of the<br />\npeople of this University. As Young<br />\nTrustee, I would use my best judgment<br />\nand prior knowledge to accomplish the<br />\ngreatest benefit for both the University<br />\nand its students.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\nYoung Trustee?<br />\nI hope to continue to serve the University as I have enjoyed doing these past<br />\nfour years. It has been my experience<br />\nthat little is ever accomplished by rages<br />\nand sensationalization. To the position of<br />\nYoung Trustee I hope to bring a loyalty<br />\nand a vision most undergraduates do not<br />\nhave for the student body and the University as a whole. It is only by such rational<br />\nthinking and effort that a Young Trustee<br />\ncan hope to fulfill the commission which<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower set forth when he<br />\nestablished the position.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br /><br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nAlthough not the most glamorous of<br />\nissues, the need for adequate student<br />\nhousing and amenities as well as library<br />\nspace is a very real problem facing the<br />\nBoard at this time. McCoy and Wolman<br />\nare in desperate need of repair and some<br />\nplans for their renovation and/or<br />\nreconstruction call for additional student<br />\namenities in the buildings. This would<br />\nbenefit not only those students living in<br />\nthese two buildings but all students. Furthermore, our library is literally filled to<br />\ncapacity and needs expansion. I feel these<br />\nimprovements are essential to the wellbeing of undergraduates at this campus.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI plan to work in the BaltimoreWashington area in government service<br />\nfor the next few years before I pursue law<br />\nschool. This will allow me to attend all<br />\nBoard and committee meetings as well<br />\nas remain acquainted with the campus.<br />\nIn my four years at Johns Hopkins I have<br />\nenjoyed seeing the improvements which<br />\nI am sure other Young Trustees have<br />\ndeliberated over; I hope I can do the<br />\nsame for future generations of Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br /><br />\n1. What are your qualifications for being Young Trustee?<br />\nI feel my qualifications are explained in<br />\nmy candidate's statement:<br />\nFor the past four years. I have been involved in several facets of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. I have taken each challenge<br />\nwith the same goal; to make Hopkins a<br />\n,<br />\nbetter place. It is because of this same,,<br />\ngoal that I am running for Young<br />\nTrustee. I feel I have qualities needed to<br />\ndo the job with success and professionalism. Some of the qualities a Young<br />\nTrustee needs are dedication, knowledge<br />\nof the University, and an open mind.<br />\nFor the past three years I have put at<br />\nleast 40 hours a week in extracurricular<br />\nactivities while maintaining my status as<br />\na full time Engineering student. I have<br />\nspent all three summers in Baltimore<br />\nworking on projects for the academic<br />\nyear. Hopefully, you have benefitted<br />\nfrom programs like the Quad Monitors<br />\nand the Project Blue Jay fundraiser.<br />\nThrough other activities, such President<br />\nof the Student Council, Housemaster,<br />\nFraternity involvement, intramural and<br />\nvarsity athletics, et cetera, I have gained a working knowledge of most areas<br />\nof the University. I have seen problems<br />\nfrom a student, administrative, and faculty point of view.<br />\nA Trustee is responsible for most divisions of Hopkins, not just Homewood.<br />\nI feel I am flexible enough to adapt to<br />\nunderstanding the concerns of all.<br />\nAlthough I must be sensitive to all divisions, I will never forget wherer I have<br /><br />\ncome from. I do not feel I would be a good<br />\nTrustee if I did not help solve the problems here at Homewood.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nMy first goal is to gain a quick yet<br />\nthorough understanding of all of Johns<br />\nHopkins, as well as the workings of the<br />\nBoard. Secondly, I will bring a current<br />\nunderstanding on problems to the<br />\nTrustees. Finally, I hope to be flexible<br />\nenough to handle unexpected problems<br />\nwith the care, dedication, and loyalty<br />\nwhich I have tried to use while an<br />\nundergraduate<br />\n3.

What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI would like to respond to these two<br />\nquestions with the following answer.<br />\nThe position of Young Trustee was<br />\ncreated by Milton Eisenhower to provide<br />\na way for the Board of Trustees to be<br />\ndirectly exposed to student perception,<br />\nneeds, and concerns. However, the<br />\nYoung Trustee also has the same obligation as the other members of the Board<br />\nto maintain and improve the general<br />\nwelfare of the University as a whole. In<br />\nthis undertaking it is necessary to be able<br />\nto look at Hopkins as a multi-faceted institution with various divisions and involvements not only at Homewood, but<br />\nall over the world. It is with this aim in<br />\nmind that I wish to be considered for the<br />\nposition of Young Trustee.<br />\nHaving spent a year at the School of<br />\nInternational Studies in Bologna, Italy,<br />\nI feel that I have developed a much<br />\nbroader perspective on Johns Hopkins<br />\nthan I would have in spending four years<br />\nhere at Homewood. In my three years in<br />\nBaltimore I have been very involved in<br />\nstudent life and organized activities on<br />\ncampus, as well as worked with the administration on many concerns of both<br />\nstudents and the University in general.<br />\nIt is the combination of my experiences<br />\nin Bologna and at Homewood which has<br />\ndeveloped my strong concern for the<br />\nfuture direction of the University and<br />\nwhich makes me feel confident that I am<br />\nqualified for the position of Young<br />\nTrustee. As a Young Trustee I would try<br />\nto make known to the Board the students'<br /><br />\ncurrent perceptions mid needs, but even<br />\nmore what it is like to be a student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. In doing this I would riot<br />\nnecessarily be representing the students,<br />\nbut would be emphasizing the importance<br />\nof the Board's consideration of the student element in matters of the Universty's current and future situations.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning. undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of 'Trustees should consider?<br />\nI do not feel that there exists one issue<br />\nthat need be considered by the Board of<br />\nTrustees that is more important to<br />\nundergraduates than any other. What I<br />\ndo feel needs to be done by the Board is<br />\nto not necessarily pick one or two issues<br />\nimportant to undergraduate life, but<br />\nrather to keep the effect on<br />\nundergraduates of its actions in mind<br />\nwhile making and planning decisions. In<br />\norder to achieve this goal I would encourage the Board to continue its efforts<br />\nto communicate with the student body<br />\ndirectly on issues of particular importance, in addition to voicing student concerns myself.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nI am currently exploring employment<br />\nopportunities in the financial services industry, specifically in commercial and investment banking. I plan to be working<br />\nin either New York City or in the<br />\nBaltimore/Washington area. In either<br />\ncase I would be readily available to attend both the meetings of the entire<br />\nBoard of Trustees as well as committee<br />\nneetings.<br /><br />\n6/MARCH 6, 1987<br /><br />\n3 RTS<br />\nORAL<br />\nWILL DIE !<br />\nif cny -oa\n*commits just ono<br />\n*<br />\nsins:<br /><br />\nMore Young Trustee<br />\nCandidate Statements<br />\nMarie Rodriguez<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\n*tho following<br />\n*<br />\n4:<br />\n*<br />\n* 1).hcro sec cluooing *<br />\n* 2) monkey socnking<br />\n*<br />\n: 3) \\OT VOTI\\G for the :<br />\n*<br />\nt<br />\nuoconning Stucont<br />\n*<br />\nCouncil ono Young *<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nElections:<br />\nTrustee<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br /><br />\n1.What are your qualifications for being Young Trustee?<br />\nI have been involved with many facets<br />\nof Hopkins life in my years here, including Blue Key Society, the revival of<br />\nmagazine<br />\nthe science fiction<br />\nHopSFAnatic, being a Student Advisor,<br />\nand co-SAC liason to the HOP. This year<br />\nI helped found the Comic Book Club,<br />\nand organize the first Hopkins Cultural<br />\nFestival. Through these and other activities, I believe that I have gained an<br />\ninsight to the thoughts of many different<br />\nstudents, and how to get their support in<br />\nworking together.<br />\n3. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nThe opportunity to be involved with<br />\npeople is one of the greatest things I have<br />\ngained from being here. I have watched<br />\nthe effects of policy on undergraduate<br />\nlife, and understand the ramifications of<br />\nsuch decisions. I would like a hand in<br />\nshaping such policies. I believe that my<br />\ninvolvement with the campus puts me in<br />\na position to help make proper decisions.<br />\nI hope to gain a better understanding of<br />\nthe inner working of the University, and<br />\nto do my best to assure that the policies<br />\nreflect the needs of the undergraduates<br />\nas well as the entire University. I've enjoyed my time here and would welcome<br /><br />\nthe chance to influence the future of<br />\nHopkins in an effort to improve the quality of campus life for all members of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins community.<br />\n3. What is the most important issue<br />\nconcerning undergraduates that the<br />\nBoard of Trustees should consider?<br />\nNot South Africa. I think the issue of<br />\nfinances is a little more immediate for the<br />\nstudent body. Tuition is continuing to increase, and though it admittedly only<br />\npays for a portion of true educational<br />\ncosts, the Board should consider what<br />\nportion of costs students should be<br />\nresponsible for, especially when the<br />\ngovernment is talking about eliminating<br />\nthe NDSL and work-study programs,<br />\nand replacing the GSL with a high interest loan.<br />\n4. What are your plans after graduation and how will those plans affect<br />\nyour ability to perform the duties of<br />\nYoung Trustee?<br />\nEventually, I plan to go to graduate<br />\nschool, but more immediately, I intend<br />\nto spend the next year or two working<br />\nin the Baltimore/Washington area. Since<br />\nI will be close to Hopkins, I will be able<br />\nto attend the board meetings, and remain<br />\naware of what is happening on the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br /><br />\nworked in the library and for the S.C.S.<br />\nI believe that I have also not lost contact<br />\nwith the undergrads and their concerns,<br />\nas several of the present student leaders<br />\nhave.<br />\n2. What do you hope to accomplish as<br />\na Young Trustee?<br />\nTo serve this institution to the best of<br />\nmy ability and hopefully have some fun<br />\nalso.<br />\n3.

The conference<br />\nwas organized by sophomore<br />\nKris Mauren and sponsored by<br />\nthe College Republicans and the<br />\nYoung Democrats.<br />\nFour speakers addressed a<br />\nvariety of topics in forty-minute<br />\nlectures followed by question and<br />\nanswer periods.<br />\nThe first presentation was<br />\n\"Moral Foundations of a Free<br />\nSociety,\" by Robert Sirico.<br />\nSirico, a seminarian at St. Mary's<br />\nCollege, presented an introduction to the other lectures, aspects<br />\nof which were covered in more<br />\ndepth by the other lecturers.<br />\nSirico's lecture was followed<br />\nby \"Capitalism Reconsidered:<br />\nThe History (and Myths) of a<br />\nFree Economy\" by Howard<br />\nBaetjer, Jr. of the Foundation for<br />\nEconomic Education, \u2014 Problems<br />\nand Issues in Economics\" by Don<br />\nBoudreaux of George Mason<br />\nUniversity, and \"The Political<br />\nEconomy of Segregation\" by<br />\nJennifer Roback of'George<br />\nMason.<br />\nA lunch with the speakers and<br />\ntwo discussion periods were also<br />\nincluded, giving those who attended a chance to meet the<br />\nlecturers.<br />\nSirico began his lecture by<br />\nnoting that V.I. Lenin once said<br />\nthat \"Ideas are more fatal than<br />\nguns. There is a reciprocal relationship between what we think<br />\nand what we value, said Sirico,<br />\nsince \"ideas form the basis of<br />\npeople's actions.\"<br />\nHe went on to describe a<br />\nsystem of government which he<br />\nsaid \"may be accepted by all persons who are willing to banish<br />\nforce and fraud\" from their lives.<br />\nThe body of the presentation<br />\nbegan with what Sirico called<br />\n\"the theoretical conditions of<br />\nfreedom.\" He stressed the basic<br />\nimportance of freedom to morality, saying that \"morality that is<br />\nnot chosen is no morality.\" In<br /><br />\nsupport of this, he said that no action taken under compulsion<br />\ncould be considered noble or virtuous; without choice, actions<br />\ncannot be considered right or<br />\nwrong since there are no alternatives with which to compare<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe person being compelled by<br />\nforce to act in a certain way does<br />\nnot bear the moral responsibility<br />\nfor his actions, Sirico pointed out.<br />\nLater, he clarified his stand, saying, \"Freedom is not so much a<br />\nvirtue in itself as the context in<br />\nwhich virtue is possible.\"<br />\nHe said that in a truly free<br />\nsociety, the only limits on the<br />\npursuit of values by members of<br />\nthe society are the rights of<br />\nothers. \"I am not an anarchist. I<br />\nwant to be very clear about that,he said in answer to a question at<br />\nthe end of the lecture.<br />\nHe said that he believes the<br />\ngovernment has valid functions,<br />\nbut that these are only those involving protecting its citizens<br />\nfrom internal and external force<br />\nand fraud.\"<br />\nSirico then went on to address<br />\nthe question of rights, describing<br />\n\"what it is about humans which<br />\njustifies their having rights,\" and<br />\nwhat those rights are. \"We are<br />\nself-directing, thinking beings<br />\nwho survive by the use of<br />\nreason,\u2014 he said.<br />\nDiscussing the right of property first, Sirico said that the institution of property stems from a<br />\nrelationship with nature \"that is<br />\nmore than immediate and temporary.\" \"Wealth and property<br />\ncome into existence only when<br />\npeople value things.\" He said that<br />\nwhen the right to property is seen<br />\nin this light, it is \"the safeguard<br />\nof other rights,\" in that it is the<br />\nmost basic demonstration of the<br />\nfreedom to pursue values.<br />\nSirico said that the ideas of both<br />\nconservatives and liberals are<br />\ncounter to the establishment of a<br />\nfree society in many respects.<br />\n\"The liberals would be happy<br />\nwith freedom in the bedroom, but<br />\nno in the marketplace,[while] the<br />\nconservatives would be happy<br />\nwith freedom for big business,<br /><br />\nbut not for homosexuals.\u2014 \u2014 Both<br />\n, sides become similar in view of<br />\nthe means which they use to<br />\nachieve their goals\"\u2014force.<br />\nHe said that he is in favor of<br />\nhelping the poor, but he does not<br />\nthink that welfare supported by<br />\ntaxation and administered by the<br />\ngovernment is either an efficient<br />\nor a moral way to provide this<br />\nhelp. He cited statistics showing<br />\nthat private religious charities<br />\ndistribute more than twice as<br />\nmuch aid per dollar received than<br />\ngovernment organizations.<br />\nIn 1984, Sirico said, the total<br />\nbudgets of these private organizations was over $74 billion, plus<br />\nvolunteer time adding to $65<br />\nbillion. He claimed that the totali<br />\nof these exceeded the poverty<br />\nbudgets of the Federal, state, and<br />\nlocal governments combined in<br />\nthat year.<br />\n\"For me, one value is [to<br />\nreverse] the plight of poor people,\" he said. He added that he<br />\ndoes not want to force this value<br />\non anyone else. \"I think a<br />\nmarket-based society is the best<br />\nway to help the poor,\" he explained, saying that production<br />\nrather than distribution should be<br />\nthe first concern of anyone interested in charitable endeavors.<br />\nIf no one is able to produce, there<br />\nwill be nothing to distribute.<br />\nThe fouth lecture of the day,<br />\ngiven by Professor Jennifer<br />\nRoback, was entitled \"The<br />\nPolitical Economy of Segregation.\" Roback discussed the application of what she called<br />\n\"libertarian ideas\" to the<br />\neconomic aspects of racism, concentrating on the problems experienced by blacks in the United<br />\nStates in the period since the Civil<br />\nWar.<br />\nRoback presented a simple<br />\neconomic theory to the effect that<br />\nracial discrimination in employment is costly to the businesses<br />\nwhich practice it, since passing<br />\nup job candidates for less<br />\nqualified candidates of whatever<br />\nrace will result in a less capable<br />\ngroup of employees.<br />\nTherefore, \"in the long run,<br />\nthe competitive process should<br /><br />\neliminate differences in earnings to another and bargain tor wages.<br />\nbetween different ethnic groups,\"<br />\nRoback said that most<br />\nshe said, calling this \"a very historians agree that the incomes<br />\nelegant model,\" but one which of black and white farm workers<br />\ndoes not explain the fact that per- in the South during this period<br />\nsistent differences in earnings do were approximately equal.<br />\nexist.<br />\nHowever, many of the laws<br />\nHer conclusion, supported by which institituted the policies of<br />\na historical summary and segregation were economic in efanalysis, was that governmental fect, Roback claimed.

Unlike last year,<br />\nthe decision, at least for the SC top spot, will<br />\nnot be an easy one.<br />\nAs most undergraduates know by now, the<br />\nthree contenders in the battle for the SC<br />\npresidency are Sophomore Class President Scott<br />\nFitzGerald, SC Treasurer David Shade, and<br />\nJunior Class President Sahir Surmeli. All three<br />\nare seasoned Council members and student<br />\nleaders. Each seems capable of doing the job<br />\nand responsible enough to put in the time to do<br />\nit right. So, the election this year seems destined<br />\nto he an election based on\"political\" issues<br />\nrather than on the capability and competence<br />\nof those running. And that is how it should be.<br />\nWe believe that the single most important<br />\npolitical issue in this campaign is defining the<br />\nrole of Council. Traditionally, Council has attempted to serve the dual role of planning social<br />\nevents and dealing with more important<br />\nissues\" like divestment, freedom of speech,<br />\nundergraduate education, intersession, security, etc. . . .<br />\nWith the creation of the HOP several years<br />\nago to oversee the planning of social events and<br />\nwith growing student interest in the \"impor-<br /><br />\ntant issues,\" the balance of Council's concerns<br />\nseems to have tipped much more on the side<br />\nof the latter in recent years. We would like to<br />\nsee that trend continue.<br />\nWe hope that, next year, Council wi!I devote<br />\nthe lion's share of its attention to the \"important issues\" and leave social events to the HOP.<br />\nSo this year, we endorse Sahir Surmeli for the<br />\nposition of Student Council President because<br />\nhe seems to share this vision of Council with<br />\nus, much more so than FitzGerald or Shade.<br />\nIf our deciphering of FitzGerald's comments<br />\non these pages last week is correct, FitzGerald<br />\nseems inclined to tip the balance of Council's<br />\nconcerns back to the planning of social events.<br />\nShade, on the other hand believes that \"communication\" ought to be Council's top priority and that Council \"should do whatever it is<br />\nthat is wanted of us. .1by I the student body<br />\nthat year.\" Over the years, we have seen too<br />\nmany SC presidential candidates focusing on<br />\nthe vague notion of improving communication<br />\nand listening to the student body to be very excited about Shade's priorities.<br />\nCouncil needs a leader who intends to tackle<br />\n\"important issues\" next year, not someone who<br />\nwants Council to be throwing parties or \"improving communication.\" We think Sahir<br />\nSurmeli is the best man for the job.<br /><br />\nIn the wake of the latest arson<br />\nand wrecking of the Coalition for<br />\na Free South Africa shanty, one<br />\nmust harshly scrutinize claims<br />\nthat free speech is a norm on the<br />\nHopkins campus. It seems that<br />\nevery time leftists try to make<br />\ntheir sentiments known through<br />\naccepted symbolism, this symbolism is violently repressed.<br />\nWhile the repression of leftists is<br />\nnot official or formal policy of<br /><br />\nan otherwise happy institution.<br />\nThis explanation cannot begin to<br />\naddress why actions occurred as<br />\nthey did, for it assumes things we<br />\nknow cannot be true: that Muller<br />\nwould choose to disrupt campus<br />\npeace without reason. In fact, we<br />\nknow that Muller is a highly<br />\nastute politician who does not<br />\ntake the least of his actions lightly.

The<br />\nreport, which has been in the works since<br />\nDecember, not surprisingly proposes recommendations which are unprecedented in the recent history of Homewood student activities.<br />\nFor example, the report advocates placing the<br />\nentire Orientation program, one of the most<br />\nsuccessful student-run and student-managed activities on campus, under the purview of the<br />\nOffice of the Dean of Students rather than Student Council.

That<br />\nnews already had its fifteen<br />\nminutes. Now respectfully mixed reviews appear. Soon it will be<br />\ntime to defend Warhol.<br />\nFive arguments against Warhol<br />\nconsidered.<br />\n(1) Warhol was a glorified<br />\ncommercial artist. He began by<br />\ndrawing shoes. The implied<br />\ndistinction is not meant to elevate<br />\n\"high art\" or classical work, but<br />\nusually to denigrate commercial<br />\nor contemporary efforts, It goes<br />\nfar beyond Warhol. Accepting it<br />\nis ironic. After agreeing that common design ought to be<br />\ndisposable and not up to some<br />\nmystical standard, the proponent<br />\nof \"high art only\" then turns<br />\naround and says, look at how<br />\nterrible this common stuff is, how<br />\ngaudy our suburbs are. This is a<br />\nself-fulfilling prophecy which<br />\ncondemns society to rotten style,<br />\nexcept in museums.<br />\n(2) Warhol was too cool. He<br />\nwas too hip. He was merely posing. This argument is popular, if<br />\nonly because it appeals to reverse<br />\nelitism. There is, now more than<br />\never, a sense of things being too<br />\nfashionable and trendy, which is<br />\nto say, they are unfashionable and<br />\nought to be avoided. For the cult<br />\nthat follows each passing fad,<br />\nthere is an even larger hidden<br />\ngroup that shies away or despises<br />\nthat thing for its popularity\u2014just<br />\nas well, for that too is in. Warhol<br />\nfell victim to this. All of modern<br />\nart does.<br />\n(3) Warhol was too obvious.<br />\n\"Being good in business is the<br />\nmost fascinating kind of art,\" he<br />\nsaid. Regardless of the quality of<br />\nthe work, this ambition annoys<br />\nthose who would like art to have<br />\na certain supposed dignity. In<br />\ncriticizing Warhol then, this attitude leads to confusing the art<br />\nwith the marketing, when such<br />\nblurring by Warhol is precisely<br />\nwhat horrifies the uptight. It is a<br />\nclever tactic: criticism of the<br />\ncommercial aspect is directed<br />\nagainst the artistic aspect; all the<br />\nwhile, the two are proclaimed<br />\nseparate. If the business of<br />\ncriticism is to come down to such<br />\nthings as the price of the latest<br />\nwork, then it is perhaps appropriate to ask simply whether<br />\nin a society where a baseball<br /><br />\nSpam on Wry<br />\nAnd Just How Throaty Are<br />\n3.

When all<br />\nelse fails, and often before<br />\nanything else is tried, the losing<br />\nside in debate will often assume<br />\nthat the wining side is lying.<br />\nEverything is really the opposite<br />\nof what it seems to be. So the proper response is to agree with what<br />\nis said on the surface, thus turning the trick around and winning<br />\nby losing. Confusing? By<br />\nescalating the levels of interpretation, anything comes to mean<br />\nanything but. For Warhol, this is<br />\naltogether perfect. After all,<br />\nmultiple satire and parody can<br />\nalways escape to higher ground in<br />\nthis game.<br />\n(5) Warhol played to the<br />\nfamous. This is a classic accusation to make against an artist.<br />\nThis charge comes from the other<br />\nside. It begins by accepting Condemning Vandalism<br />\nWarhol as an artist in order to reject him. He has \"sold out.\" He To the Editor:<br />\npublishes Interview.

Rodriguez<br />\nCo-organizer Hopkins Cultural<br />\nFestival<br /><br />\nBemusing Rationale<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nfound myself bemused by<br />\nPresident Muller's rationale for<br />\nthe tuition hike; a perfect example of what Secretary Bennett<br />\nspeaks of: a complete lack of<br />\nmoral reasoning on the part of our<br />\nputative leadership. He should<br />\nknow that just because all the<br />\nother schools are raising their tuition is no reason for doing<br />\nlikewise; two wrongs do not<br />\nmake a right. With no inflation,<br />\nmillions and millions pouring in<br />\nfrom the mostly vain, the death<br />\nthroes of the American Dream,<br />\nthe faction-induced decline in<br />\nschool spirit, my intellect craves<br /><br />\nsomething more sophistical, e.g.<br />\na roasting-over of our venerable<br />\nabode's ways and means. I call to<br />\nthe student body's attention how<br />\nlast year the Hebrew University<br />\nin Israel was shut down by its<br />\nstudents when the authorities<br />\nthere tried to raise tuition to abo'ut'<br />\n$1000, the amount by which<br />\nHopkins wants to INCREMENT<br />\nits tuition.<br />\nStan Lippman<br /><br />\nGroundless Decision<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAn Academic Council, ignoring the unanimous recommendation of the Political Science<br />\ndepartment, has refused to promote Dr. David. Consequently,<br />\nhe will have to leave Hopkins at<br />\nthe end of the semester. He will<br />\nbe missed by the many students<br />\nwho will be unable to take classes<br />\nwith him. His classes are very interesting, and essential to the International Relations major. The<br />\ndecision to deny him promotion<br />\nis a very poor one, and seems<br />\ngroundless. Hopkins should not<br />\nlose a faculty member as capable<br />\nand qualified as Dr. David.<br />\nEric Espenhorst<br /><br />\nJHU a Lesser Place<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was most upset to hear that<br />\nDr. Steven David had been<br />\ndenied promotion. Though I<br />\nrespect the Academic Council's<br /><br />\ndecision, I would like to point out<br />\nseveral facts that I hope will cause<br />\nthe Council to reconsider.<br />\nDr. David's care and willingness to interact with students<br />\nshould be considered by the.<br />\nCouncil. First, he is the advisor<br />\nto approximately fifty students.<br />\nSecond, he teaches many interesting and valuable courses. It<br />\nis due in large part to Dr. David<br />\nthat the Political Science Department has such diverse classes as<br />\nContemporary International<br />\nPolitics, National Security in the<br />\nNuclear Age, and The Superpower Competition in the Third<br />\nWorld. Third, he helps students<br />\nextensively outside of the<br />\nacademic sphere. For instance,<br />\nDr. David has frequently spoken<br />\nto the International Studies<br />\nForum, and has organized<br />\nnumerous lecture series on<br />\nvarious matters of public interest.<br />\nHe also recently volunteered to<br />\nbring students to the Aberdeen<br />\nProving Grounds as part of the<br />\nFaculty-Student Interaction<br />\nProgram.<br />\nIt is hoped that the Academic<br />\nCouncil will also consider Dr.<br />\nDavid's role as the coordinator of<br />\nthe International Studies major. It<br />\nis no exaggeraton to say that Dr.<br />\nDavid is the IR Program, for it<br />\nis his work that keeps it functioning. Among other things, Dr.<br />\nDavid supervises the fulfillment<br />\nof IR requirements, the BA-MA<br />\nProgram, the Semester at SAIS,<br />\nand various internship programs.<br />\nUnder Dr. David's guidance<br />\nand leadership, the IR Program<br />\nhas blossomed into one of the best<br /><br />\nIt's eleven p.m.<br />\nDo you know where your paperis?<br /><br />\nat Hopkins. The IR major is<br />\npresently the second-largest on<br />\ncampus; the number of entering<br />\nIR majors has continually increased as more students learn<br />\nabout the quality of this program.<br />\nIndeed, the reputation of the<br />\nHopkins IR major is recognized<br />\nnationwide. Much of this can be<br />\ncredited to Dr. David's commitment and work during the last six<br />\nyears. Dr. David's departure<br />\nwill be greatly detrimental to<br />\nHopkins. The IR program will<br />\nbecome chaotic and directionless,<br />\nthe Poll. Sci. department will lose<br />\na great professor. The loss of Dr.<br />\nDavid's wonderful teaching will<br />\naffect not only IR and Poli. Sci.<br />\nmajors but others as well. In fact,<br />\nsome of the best praises for Dr.<br />\nDavid have come from non-IR<br />\nmajors who have had the opportunity to take his excellent<br />\nclasses.<br />\nhope very much that the<br />\nAcademic Council will reconsider its previous decision in light<br />\nof Dr. David's many contributions to this school and its<br />\nstudents. Dr. David's departure<br />\nwill result in Hopkins being a<br />\nlesser place.<br />\nRaphael Cung<br /><br />\nIrreparable Damage<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt is quite frightening to see a<br />\nuniversity, or even a particular<br />\ndepartment, faced with potentially irreparable damage to its<br />\nreputation. It's even more<br /><br />\nfrightening to think that the impending damage may have been<br />\ncaused<br />\nunknowinglv<br />\nor<br />\nunwillingly.<br />\nThe recent decision by the<br />\nAcdemic Council to deny Professor David's promotion to the<br />\nassociate level poses, I believe, a<br />\nthreat of such grave damage to<br />\nthe University, the political<br />\nscience department, the students<br />\nwho major or take courses in the<br />\nfield of International Studies, and<br />\nof course, Professor David<br />\nhimself. Why, one must ask,<br />\nwould the Council risk doing such<br />\ndamage?<br />\nProfessor David virtually<br />\nremade the international studies<br />\nmajor; it has burgeoned during<br />\nhis tenure at Hopkins. The administrative workload (catering to<br />\nsome 2(X)s students each week) is<br />\nenormous. Yet, despite the fact<br />\nthat until this year, he had no administrative assistance, Professor<br />\nDavid has published diverse<br />\nworks, including his most recent<br />\nThird World Coups d'Etat and International Security, while<br />\nteaching several courses each<br />\nyear. Incredibly, despite<br />\nunanimous departmental support,<br />\ndsepite the ad hoc committee's<br />\nrecommendation, and despite<br />\nProfessor David's superb performance, the Academic Council<br />\ndenied his promotion.<br />\nSuch a decision can have only<br />\nnegative effects. It suggests that<br />\nthe University does not appreciate<br />\nthe tremendous demands of the<br />\ninternational studies field. If<br />\nContinued on Page 15<br /><br />\nLet's he real.

Of course, those same<br />\npeople probably counted the L.A. Lakers out too this year.<br />\nStill, this may be the year that Hopkins haters around<br />\nthe nation have been waiting for. Losses to graduation<br />\nand injury have been severe for Don Zimmerman's Blue<br />\nJays, who open their '86 campaign tomorrow at Syracuse.<br />\nMost notably absent are midfielder Del Dressel and<br />\ndefenseman John DeTommaso, two of the all time greats<br />\nwho combined for an astounding seven 1st-team AllAmerica honors.

No<br />\nlonger will he be able to deliver feeds from behind the<br />\nnet or sneak around the sides as now he has defensive<br />\nresponsibilities. How well Wood takes to his new environment may well determine whether the Jays can make it<br />\nto Rutgers for the Final Four. Of course, if this is all they<br /><br />\nneed, then it will be no problem, as Wood has the versatility<br />\nand cannon shot to make Zim look like a genius.<br />\nScoring in general won't be the problem, as the squad<br />\nis loaded with guns. Co-captain Bubier led Hopkins in<br />\ngoals last year with 35, including an astounding eight<br />\nagainst Navy. With Dressel gone and Wood moved, he<br />\nmay well score 50 this year. Morrill, who has started since<br />\nhe's been at Hopkins, probably deserved to make AllAmerica last year. The problem is that there just aren't<br />\nenough balls to go around. He's scored 45 goals in two<br />\nyears here, which is even more impressive when you consider that he's only taken 109 shots.<br />\nThere's no question that the Jays can put the ball in the<br />\nnet, the problem is whether they can keep it out.

Hopes for a tie, however, sailed away with Craig<br />\nBubier's errant shot with 20 seconds to play and Coach<br />\nZimmerman was handed his first home loss. This year<br />\nHopkins will travel up to Syracuse with hopes of avenging that loss and spoiling the Oranges' home opener.<br />\nSyracuse will enter this game with a very strong team.<br />\nLast year as a freshman, Syracuse attackman John Zulberti<br />\ndazzled the Homewood crowd with some outrageous<br />\nstickwork. As a sophomore this year, he will team with<br />\nsenior All-America sniper Tom Nelson to form one of<br />\nthe top attack units in the country. Senior All-America<br />\nTodd Curry, whom many considered to be the best player<br />\nin Division I lax last year, will again be the main man<br />\nat midfield. Curry used his outstanding speed and<br />\nquickness to tally five goals against the Blue Jays last year.<br />\nSenior goalie Jim Gyory had an excellent season last year,<br />\nsaving over 63 percent of all opponent shots on goal. The<br />\nloss of several top defensemen from last year's team will<br />\nput Gyory on the spot a bit, though.<br />\nThis year's game played indoors at the Carrier Dome<br />\nshould be as fast-paced as early season game as you are<br />\nlikely to see. The Syracuse game plan will be run and<br />\ngun, fast breaking at every opportunity. To counter this<br />\nHopkins must control the faceoffs and the ground ball<br />\npossessions. The Blue Jays are going to have to score<br />\ngoals, lots of them, if they are to win this game. The combination of a loaded Syracuse offense and an inexperienced<br />\nHopkins defense should make for a big day for the Orange<br />\nmarksmen. That and the fact that this will be the Blue Jays'<br />\nfirst regular season game, plus home field advantage for<br />\nthe Orange should make for a Syracuse victory.

Virginia even made it to overtime of the<br />\nfinal game.<br />\nThis trend should continue in '87 as any one of these<br />\nsix teams could take the crown. North Carolina is the<br />\noverwhelming consensus favorite by virtue of the fact that<br />\nthey won the title last year and return almost everybody.<br />\nThe Jays, the traditional pre-season pick, are of course<br />\nstill a threat, but may be in for a tough regular season<br />\nas their schedule is the hardest in the nation, and every<br />\nopponent will be confident for the game knowing that this<br />\nmay be the year that Hopkins is a bit down.<br />\nWith that said, here's our predictions of which 12 teams<br />\nwill make the NCAA's expanded tournament field in May,<br />\nand the order in which they'll be seeded.

Also on hand for<br />\nScroggs are Chris Walker, a two-time Honorable Mention, and Boyd Harden, a 3rd Team All-America in 1985<br />\nwho sat out last season \\\\ ith a wrist injury. In<br />\nScroggs can once again call on Barney Aburn, whom the<br />\nJays bombed in midseason, but then were stymied by in<br />\nthe playoffs.

So what happened in the playoffs?<br />\nThe Heels beat Maryland in College Park, shocked the<br />\nJays in overtime in the semis, and then completed the hat<br />\ntrick by wiping out the Cavaliers in the finals. In the process they became the first team to be seeded as low as<br />\nfifth to win the title.<br />\nWhat makes Carolina so scary is that they were able<br />\nto accomplish all this in what was essentially a rebuilding<br />\nyear.

Brendan Kelly, a first-teamer last season<br />\nwith 9 goals and 11 assists, is recovering from a knee injury and will likely return in another week. That's the<br />\ngood news.

After Wood, though, there are question<br />\nmarks.<br />\nAgainst Syracuse, the other first line midfielders will<br />\nbe senior co-captain Bruce Chanenchuk and sophomore<br />\nJohn Wilkens. Chanenchuk is a heady, solid player who<br />\nplays excellent defense, but has never been a big scorer<br />\n(3 goals, 7 assists). His leadership and speed are a big<br />\nplus. Wilkens didn't see much time as a frosh, but when<br />\nhe did he showed flashes. He's got the size (6'2\", 185<br />\nlbs.) and potential to be a threat with the ball. When Kelly is hale, he'll likely replace Chanenchuk, who would<br />\nmove to the second line.<br />\nThis year's second midfield will be led by Larry<br />\nLedoyen, who performed a similar role in '86. Ledoyen,<br />\na senior, had eight goals in his first year as a Blue Jay,<br />\nbut no assists. Zimmerman expects big things from this<br />\none-time high school superstar this year. Joining Ledoyen<br />\non second midfield, which ideally is on as much as the<br />\nfirst line, are Pat Russell and Joe Diorio. Russell, a<br />\nsophomore, started last season on attack before moving<br />\nto midfield late in the year. \"He can run up and down<br />\nthe field all day,\" says Zimmerman. Diorio has been the<br />\npleasant surprise of camp, coming out of a year's retirement to earn a regular spot.<br />\nThe other three midfielders, John Dressel, Greg Gunning, and Greg Kelly will run a third midfield line. Dressel<br />\nstarted two years ago alongside his brother Del and scored<br />\n9 goals. He sat out with an injury in '86 and is still not<br />\nall the way back.<br />\nGunning will have the important chore of handling<br />\nfaceoffs for the Jays. He was five for eleven last year as<br />\nRzempoluch's backup, but now he must step in and he the.<br />\nman.

He took up the sport full time<br />\nlast year and made honorable mention as a rope man. This<br />\nyear though, he'll start out on the close defense, along<br />\nwith sophomores Dave Pietramala and Greg Lilly.<br />\nPietramala (6'3\", 190 lbs.) missed much of last year with<br />\nmono, but when he cracked the lineup late in the season<br />\nhe played like the future superstar he's been touted to be.<br />\nLilly also didn't play much as a frosh, but has looked sharp<br />\npre-season scrimmages.<br />\nJames DeTommaso, John's younger brother, saw a lot<br />\nof time coming off the bench last year and excelled, but<br />\nhas been slowed this spring with a bad knee. If he can<br />\ncome in and be the force his brother was, something he<br />\nmay be up to, than it will free Zimmerman to move Mitchell to the rope.<br />\nWith a rule limiting teams to five long sticks, Zimmerman had to use a midfielder, Damon Stewart, on the rope<br />\nunit that formerly was all defensemen. Stewart thrived<br /><br />\non the role and will assume it again this year. He'll likely team with senior Mike Webster and freshman Dave<br />\nHowland, although Mitchell and sophomore Steve Ciccarone may also be called upon.<br />\nOther defensemen are sophomore Chip Dates, and<br />\nWalk-ons Eric Sham.

The Barnstormers have been a part of the<br />\ncampus for well over six decades.<br />\nTheir name comes from the Merrick Barn, which houses their office full of posters, props and<br />\ncostumes. During the usual<br />\nschool year, their schedule includes 2 mainstage plays (professionally directed plays in the L/V<br />\nRoom), a mainstage musical, 3<br />\nstudio plays (student-directed<br />\nplays in the Barn, like Spoon<br />\nRiver Anthology), and one production called \"The Freshman<br />\nOne-Acts.\" The One-Acts represent what is at the heart of the<br />\nBarnstormers: getting people involved in student theater.<br />\nFreshman are cast in five or six<br />\none-act plays which are produced and directed by upperclass<br />\nBarnstormers. This past fall.<br />\nplays by Christopher Durang,<br />\nTennesee Williams and Harod<br />\nPinter were among those<br />\npresented.

Goucher and<br />\nPeabody performing highlights<br /><br />\nfrom Cats and Applause and other<br />\nmusicals. \"This is the most<br />\ntalented group I've seen in a<br />\nHopkins musical,\" said Piccinini.<br />\nThe muscial will run during<br />\nSpring Fair, as well as April 24,<br />\n25, 26\u2014Homecoming Weekend.<br />\nOn April 25, for the first time,<br />\nthere will be an \"Alumni night\"<br />\nincluding the musical and a<br />\ncocktail party in the Glass<br />\nPavillion. Will the Barnstormers<br />\nmake the foray into politicking?<br />\n\"Public relations is the main<br />\nthing,\" assured Piccinini.<br />\n\"Public relations within<br />\nHopkins is important,\" said<br />\nGerry. Through PR the group has<br />\nbeen able to accomodate its different tendencies. Two directions<br />\nwithin the group give the Barnstormers range and vitality: many<br />\npeople are drawn to professional<br />\nproductions like Arsenic and Old<br />\nLace or the musical, while others<br />\nare interested in studio theater<br />\nlike Alex Willis' Squirrels or<br />\nSpoon River. \"We are constantly trying to expand our range,\"<br />\nsaid Gerry.<br />\nPlans for expansion include a<br />\ncomedy improvisation troupe,<br />\nand an \"Actors' Lab\" that Gerry<br />\nhopes will be a workshoporiented series presenting studentwritten plays. While the Actor's<br />\nLab would provide participation<br />\nfor actors who don't get involved in mainstage productions, the<br />\nimprov group would spark interest in audiences not normally<br />\ninterested in formal \"theater.\"<br />\nSometimes the two directions<br />\nwithin the Barnstormers meet:<br />\nthis weekend and next they are<br />\npresenting a mainstage production of The Real Thing.

This has no glitz,<br />\nno dash. But even though Quilters<br />\nis a bit rough around the edges,<br />\nit's got heart.<br /><br />\nSarah (Ann Helms Irons) is a<br />\nquilter. As a last gift to her six<br />\ndaughters, she is leaving them a<br />\n\"Legacy Quilt.\" \"You'll see a<br />\nthread of my life in there from<br />\ntime to time,\" she says with<br />\ngood, folksy charm. Suddenly the<br />\ncast starts singing, \"Pieces of<br />\nlife, pieces of women . . \" For<br />\nthe women in the patriarchal<br />\nsociety of the Old West, quilting<br />\nreally was pieces of their lives. It<br />\nwas a way to express their inner<br />\nemotions and thoughts on life and<br />\nhistory.<br />\nAnd what a history it was.<br />\nThrough starvation, blizzards and<br />\nloneliness, the seven actresses<br />\nrtray three enerations of<br /><br />\npioneer men and women. The<br />\nLegacy Quilt is made up of<br />\n\"blocks\" and each block tells a<br />\ndifferent story. The first block<br />\ntells of the \"rocky road west\"<br />\nthat Sarah's parents overcame<br />\nwhen the prairies were first being settled. The second block tells<br />\nof the crude and often dangerous<br />\nmakeshift homes the first settlers<br />\nlived in.<br /><br />\nThe third block deals with<br />\nchildhood, now that the people<br />\nhave settled down with their environment. One girl tells of her<br />\nencounter with \"the curse.\"<br />\nAnother girl talks about her<br />\nsister, a much better quilter than<br />\nshe is, and how she eventually exacts her revenge. With these two<br />\nmonologues (from Tracey<br />\nMeyers and Leisa Kelley, respectively) the play hits its stride. The<br />\naudience laughs genuinely and<br />\nfalls silent at other times\u2014the<br />\nmagic of theater has been<br />\nachieved.<br /><br />\nsing-songy, like the method of<br />\nquilting. \"Children Come Thread<br />\nthe Needle\" is very effective, as<br />\nit describes the down-and-through<br />\nand down-and-through method of<br />\nstitching. And the singing is for<br />\nthe most part admirable, although<br /><br />\nRosemary Polen seems to be the<br />\nonly one whose voice is<br />\nremarkable.<br />\nAll in all, Quilters has the kind<br />\nof charm one would expect from<br />\na good, old-fashioned, handmade<br />\nquilt. It's a bit cruder than most<br /><br />\nTheatre Hopkins productions, but<br />\nthat is the price you pay for variety in theater. And all those people in the audience laughing<br />\ndidn't seem to mind.<br /><br />\nectre<br />\nKIns<br />\nKaye Dies, Era Ends<br /><br />\nThe play goes on, revealing the<br />\nlife stories as each block of the<br />\nLegacy Quilt is revealed, until the<br />\n16th and final block is set. By<br />\nthen the cast has enacted baptism,<br />\nmarriage, and fires. Suzanne<br />\nPratt's staging is inventive and<br />\nsimultaneously somber and eyecatching. The acting is earnest,<br />\nand especially good are Kelley<br />\nand Irons as the mother.<br />\nThe music, by Barbara<br />\nDamashek is a mixture of Country, Folk and Native American.<br />\nIt fits just right as played by Chris<br />\nNorman, Laurie Harper, and<br />\nRobin Bullock.

Having been one 01<br />\nHollywood's brightest stars in the<br />\n40's and 50's, Mr. Kaye won an<br />\nhonorary Oscar, a . Kennedy<br />\nCenter Medal, and unanimous<br />\npraise for his work with<br />\nUNICEF.<br />\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1913,<br />\nKaye at first aspired to be a doctor. But money was scarce, and<br />\nin the Depression he started performing at parties and night<br />\nclubs. In 1941 came his first big<br />\nbreak, a cameo in the Broadway<br />\nproduction Lady in the Dark.<br />\nKaye delighted the audience with<br />\nhis patter song, \"Tchaikovsky,\"<br />\nin which he rattled off the names<br />\nof 50 Russian composers in half<br />\na minute.

In 1943 he achieved<br />\nstardom a a beleaguered soldier<br />\nin Up In Arms. He stayed in the<br />\nwest and went on to star in such<br />\nfamous film comedies as Wonder<br />\nMan, The Secret Life of Walter<br />\nMitty, and The Inspector General.<br />\nIn 1953 he played his most<br />\nfamous part, the kind-hearted<br />\nstoryteller Hans Christian<br />\nAndersen.<br />\nKaye became famous playing<br />\nthe good-natured milquetoast who<br />\nwins out in the end. He was good<br />\nnatured in real life as well, raising over $5 million for Symphony<br />\nMusicians and working as an<br />\nhonorary Ambassador for<br />\nUNICEF. His greatest joy, that<br />\nof entertaining children, was evident by the many children who<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nappeared on his TV series, \"The<br />\nDanny Kaye Show\".<br />\nA man of many talents, Kaye<br />\nwas an avid fan of music and<br />\nsports. He helped start the Seattle Mariners, and was also an excellent conductor. What Zubin<br />\nMehta called \"innate musical<br />\ntalent\" helped him conduct many<br />\norchestras, including the New<br />\nYork Philharmonic. His wife, the<br />\npianist-composer Sylvia Fine,<br />\nhelped write many of his patter<br />\nsongs.<br />\nAlthough Danny Kaye is gone,<br />\nthe laughter is not dead. His goal<br />\nwas to make people laugh, and he<br />\nsucceeded. \"I never wanted to<br />\nplay Hamlet,\" he said. By seeing<br />\nthe films and old TV shows that<br />\ndisplayed his energy and zany<br />\nwit, we can enjoy Kaye's gift for<br />\nlaughter for years to come.<br /><br />\nEntertaining Barnstormers Put Out<br />\nContinued from Page 21<br />\nDead about a playwright(Henry)<br />\ntrying to find a place for himself<br />\nin modern society; it is a light,<br />\nentertaining show that, through<br />\nStoppard's skill, makes serious<br />\npoints about love, art and politics.<br />\n\"We selected The Real Thing<br />\nto move slowly into more comple material,\" said Gerry.<br />\n\"Eventually I'd like to see the<br />\norganization do Cat on a Hot Tin<br />\nRoof for our mainstage.\" The<br />\nproduction of the Stoppard play,<br />\ndue to open March 6 at 8 pm in<br />\nLevering Hall's L/V Room, is<br />\ndirected by Chappel Aldridge.<br />\nAldridge, who has worked in<br />\nD.C. as a stage manager and<br />\ndirector, sees The Real Thing as<br />\na song in dialogue. \"Boy meets<br />\ngirl, boy loses girl, boy gets<br />\ngirl.\" It's a classic rock and roll<br />\nlove story, enhanced by the incidental music which is the<br />\nMonkees, Turtles and Procol<br />\nHarum that Henry loves.<br />\n\"When you laugh at this play,<br />\nyou're really laughing,\" said<br />\nGerry. \"And the cast is wonder-<br /><br />\nful. When you have veterans like<br />\nChat Ewing (\"Squirrels\") and<br />\nJeremy Golub (\"Arsenic and Old<br />\nLace\") in the supporting cast,<br />\nyou can't go wrong. The<br />\nchemistry between the actors is<br />\nastounding.\" More astounding is<br />\nthe skill of those who are not<br />\nveterans. The actor playing<br />\nHenry, Nathan Long, has had<br />\nvery little experience on the<br />\nstage. Yet Carol was impressed<br />\nwith his natural presence. \"It's<br />\nthe most naturally talented group<br />\nof actors I've ever worked with<br />\nat Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe rehearsals are over. On<br />\nMarch 6, 7, and 8 they will prove just how funny the play is, and<br />\njust how the Barnstormers have<br />\nput the right words in the right<br />\norder. \"There are people who get<br />\ntogether to do political stuff, and<br />\nothers who do social stuff,\" said<br />\nRich Bigelow. \"We're a bunch of<br />\npeople that want to get together<br />\nand do theater.\" So the Barnstormers go on, pushing forward,<br />\ntrying to nudge the world a little.<br /><br />\naWAY:BLM1inaleiC<br />\n'N.:\\:\\.1<br />\n..<br />\n\\<br />\n.\" .<br />\n,\\<br />\n.\" ..'\"\\-\"N.<br />\n..1N<br />\n.\" .<br />\n.'\\,..<br /><br />\n.<br />\n\\<br />\n.- .<br />\n\"<br />\n\\<br />\n.<br />\n.' ,'N.%\\:\\<br />\n.<br />\n.-\\.,<br /><br />\n-1..\"\\..\"\\--N...'\"\\1<br />\n.' .<br />\n\\<br />\n..<br />\n.'\" N<br />\n,' -1\\<br />\n.

Well,<br />\nmaybe not as much as a decade<br />\nago when the pre-med population<br />\nhovered around 60-65%. as compared to today's 30-35cA but there<br />\nis no doubting that much of<br />\nHopkins' character is derived<br />\nfrom these ambitious preprofessionals. The academics,<br />\nsocial life, and extracurriculars<br />\nare all affected by the pre-med's<br />\nparticipation (or lack of it), a fact<br />\nthat the student body and even the<br />\nAdministration seem to be overly aware of. Where else in the<br />\ncountry would the Student Council plan social events around the<br />\norganic chemistry exam schedule<br />\nor take care not to let a Spring Fair<br />\nconflict with the MCAT's?<br />\nThis week we present the first<br />\nof a two-part article on the state<br />\nof a pre-medical education at<br />\nHopkins for the benefit of those<br />\nwho are looking at it from the<br />\noutside and as well as those who<br />\nare looking to the future in<br />\nHopkins' rigorous preparation for<br />\nmedical school. First we shall examine the coursework the<br />\npre-meds must complete by the<br />\nend of their senior year and how<br />\nthey and their professors feel<br />\nabout it. Next week we shall<br />\ndelve deeper into the pre-med as<br />\na person, attempting to find personal and expert opinion on the<br />\nmotivations and possible<br />\ndownfalls during their career at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe pre-med freshman at<br />\nHopkins has it relatively easy his<br />\nfirst semester here compared to<br />\nmost universities. That is, if he<br />\ndoes not have advanced standing.<br />\nNearly overwhelmingly, premeds from sophomore to senior<br />\nyear praise the pass-fail first<br />\nsemester at Hopkins as a great if<br />\nnot wholly necessary institution.<br />\nMany feel that the shock of transition from high school to<br />\nHopkins would be intensified so<br />\ngreatly if the first semester was<br />\ngraded that we would lose half the<br />\npre-meds right then. Counselors<br />\nequally praise the pass-fail<br />\nsemester, but they're quick to<br />\npoint out that, \"the pass-fail<br />\nsemester is not just for premeds. . . in general, any major at<br />\nHopkins is rigorous and students<br />\nmust be given some adaption time<br />\nto learn to keep up.\"<br />\nMost people at Hopkins are<br />\nquite familiar with the courses required of the pre-med, it is hard<br />\nto go through four years without<br />\nat least one of your friends coming up and complaining about his<br />\ncourses. For those that need to be<br />\nreminded, here's a summary of<br />\nthe Hopkins pre-med curriculum.<br />\nA freshman almost always starts<br />\nout his career with \"Introductory<br />\nChemistry,\u2014 a general survey<br />\ncourse of chemistry that all<br />\nscience and nearly all engineering students must take. The stress<br />\nis on qualitative and quantitative<br />\nchemistry, and one learns all the<br />\nchemistry\u2014<br />\nof<br />\ntools<br />\nstoichiometry, ionic and covalent<br />\nbonding, thermodynamics, acidbase chemistry, and the like. Its<br /><br />\ncompanion laboratory course<br />\ndeals with much the same<br />\nmaterial and students must spend<br />\nthree hours a week doing experiments on a wide range of<br />\ntopics in chemistry ranging from<br />\ntitrations to calorimetry. This<br />\ncourse introduces students to the<br />\nscientific method and requires a<br />\nsummary of investigations in the<br />\nform of lab reports. These two<br />\ncourses and their content are pretty much similar to courses taught<br />\nto freshmen pre-meds around the<br />\nnation. The only difference is that<br />\nat Hopkins the lecturer for the<br /><br />\ndo with the chemistry of carbon,<br />\nbut it is the more complex nature<br />\nof the reactions it can undergo<br />\nthat slips up students. The vast<br />\namount of material, the<br />\nmemoriiation. and the development of a certain mode of thought<br />\nnecessary to approach the problems encountered in the course<br />\nall require vast amount of time<br />\nand effort that few students are<br />\nused to giving prior to the course.<br />\nPractice and patience are key to<br />\nsuccess in the course and without<br />\nit, students will find the theory of<br />\nreactions unmaterable. The<br />\nlaboratory course involves putting into practice some of the<br />\nreactions that were taught in the<br />\nclassroom. The reactions are long<br /><br />\nthe other sciences is popular as<br />\nwell and a precious few even try<br />\nto major in a social science and<br />\nhumanity, taking all of the above<br />\nas electives.

This course is divided into two semi-independent<br />\nparts\u2014mechanics and fluid and<br />\nsolid-state dynamics in the first<br />\nsemester, and electricity and<br />\nmagnetism in the second. The<br />\nlectures are theoretical and the<br />\nwork consists mainly of problemsolving. Again, pre-meds and<br />\nengineering students comprise the<br />\npopulation of this class.

The course is unique<br />\nsince it is taught by at least 8 different professors throughout the<br />\nyear, and students must get used<br />\nto each's teaching style and emphasis.

Freshman opinion of the course is varied, ranging from \"his reasoning is not<br />\nhard to follow\" all the way down<br />\nto \"his theoretical approach<br />\nmakes chemistry unbearable.\"<br />\nReflecting not only on his course<br />\nbut the pre-med curriculum as a<br />\nwhole, Dr. Gryder feels that the<br />\nbasic requirements are \"the bare<br />\nminimum of sciences that a doctor should comprehend before<br />\nentering his profession.\" When<br />\nasked about the relevance of<br />\nhumanities courses to pre-med requirements, Dr. Gryder replied<br /><br />\n\"Humanities reflect how you are as<br />\na person.

When the dust<br />\ncleared, however, the big Yale<br />\nCup\u2014symbol of conference<br />\n3-weapon supremacy\u2014was found<br />\nreposing safely for the fourth consecutive year in its accustomed<br />\nplace, the trophy case in the<br />\nAthletic Center fencing room.<br />\nLast year's team shattered all<br />\nconference records and won in a<br />\nwalk, but this year's was a war<br />\nof attrition. Although the Blue<br />\nJays never relinquished the lead<br />\nfrom their first bout until the end<br />\nof the tourney, the margin was so<br />\nclose\u2014varying between only two<br />\nand six bouts all day\u2014that the<br />\ntension never let up and could<br />\nhave been cut with a knife. The<br />\nHop's closest rivals\u2014William<br />\nand Mary and Vassar, both of<br />\nwhom had beaten the swordsmen<br />\nby two bouts in dual meets this<br />\nyear\u2014played leapfrog with one<br />\nanother all day trying to catch the<br />\nhigh-flying Blue Jays, but neither<br />\ncould mount a sustained effort<br />\nand the final tally showed<br />\nHopkins at the top of the heap by<br />\nthe razor-thin margin of two<br />\nbouts.<br />\nThe tournament is fenced on 9<br />\nstrips simultaneously, 3 strips per<br />\nweapon. In each weapon all the<br />\nno. 1 men fence a complete<br />\nround-robin pool on the \"A\"<br />\nstrip while the no. 2 and 3 men<br />\ndo the same on the \"B\" and \"C\"<br />\nstrips. A team's total wins(A, B,<br />\nand C pools) in each weapon<br />\ndetermine the team winners in<br /><br />\nthat weapon, while the team with<br />\nthe lleq record in all three'<br />\nweapons takes home the Yale<br />\nCup. As always, Hopkins' almost<br />\nperfect balance (22 wins in foil,<br />\n19 in epee, 19 in sabre) was the<br />\nkey. Army won the foil team title and Stevens took the sabre,<br />\nwhile William and Mary captured<br />\nthe team epee crown\u2014but in each<br />\nweapon the Jays finished a close<br />\nsecond, giving them the overall<br />\n3-weapon title.<br />\nThe foil team continued its success on the strip this past Saturday by contributing 22 victories<br />\ntoward the MAC title. Dave<br />\nCohen led the way with 10 victories in the C pool. Craig Chun<br />\nand Chai Kulsakdinun added 6<br />\nwins each. Cohen moved up to<br />\nthe finals and finished in 6th<br />\nplace; Chun and Kulsakdinun<br />\nmissed going up by narrow<br />\nmargins. The foil team finished<br />\n2nd in the foil team competition<br />\nbehind Army. But the team was<br />\nsatisfied with the 3-weapon<br />\ntrophy when Cohen won his last<br />\nbout and help the Blue Jays clinch<br />\nthe title. This year has proven to<br />\nbe a successful year for the foil<br />\nteam, which had a 14-6 record.<br />\nSenior Chun (44-18) will be leaving and will be missed.

Fencing in the B<br />\npool, senior Jeff Poehler finished with an 8-2 record and was one<br />\nof two qualifiers from that pool<br />\nto the final of six, which did not<br />\ncount for team standings.

Nelson commented that it is<br />\nalways tough to have a strong<br />\nyear when there is so much new<br />\nblood coming in, but on the other<br />\nhand it provides a good foundation on which a strong program<br />\ncan be built. Many of the new<br />\nplayers saw a large amount of<br />\nplaying time.

They<br />\naveraged 66.9 points per game,<br />\nwhile yielding 73.1. Commenting<br />\non the stats, Nelson said that \"to<br />\nhave a record of 15 wins or better, a team has to shoot at least<br />\n50 percent from the field, and<br />\naround 70 percent from the line,<br />\nand score about 75 points per<br />\ngame. \"We fell a little short of<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nOn an individual level,<br />\ngraduating senior Chris Wasson,<br />\nwho was named an academic AllAmerica, led in the total points<br />\ndepartment with 341, averaging<br />\n14.2 per game.

The character and<br />\norderliness of his program is what<br />\nevery coach, guys and dolls,<br />\ndream of. Its style is unique.<br />\nWin or lose, you'll see Dean<br />\nSmith's players run off the court<br />\nat the end of a game, whether<br />\nthey're 20 points up or 20 points<br />\ndown. Subs on the bench stand<br />\nand applaud their teammates, and<br />\non every basket that's scored off<br />\na pass, you'll see the guy who<br />\nscored point to the player who<br />\ngave him the assist.<br />\nan<br />\ntruly<br />\nis<br />\nCarolina<br />\nefficiently-run juggernaut. Even<br />\nat practice, no one gets in without<br />\na written pass from the athletic<br />\ndepartment.

And I have<br />\nto add that Bill Guthridge, Coach<br />\nSmith's No. 1 assistant, is a complementary basketball genius.<br />\nOne of Dean's greatest assets,<br />\nI feel, is that he never criticizes<br />\nhis ballplayers to the public. He<br />\nalso runs the senior star system<br />\nto take care of his upperclassmen,<br />\nbut I don't think even he can hide<br />\nfreshman J.R. Reid. Reid is<br />\ndefinitely a three-time AllAmerican, an Olympic star in<br />\nSeoul, and I've no doubt that<br />\nsomeday his jersey will be hanging at the Smith Center, alongside<br />\nthose of Michael Jordan, James<br />\nWorthy, Billy Cunningham, Sam<br />\nPerkins and on, and on, and on.<br />\nFinally, the big question: Will<br />\nthe Tar Heels win the NCAA? Or<br />\neven get to eat creole food and go<br />\nfrom the Dean Dome to the<br />\nSuperdome?<br />\nHonestly, I don't know,<br />\nbecause there the timing has to be<br />\njust right. They can't afford to<br />\nhave one of their staring<br />\nbackcourt men go down indefinitely, and they can't afford<br />\nto stay with their run-and-jump<br />\npressure defense, once opponents<br />\nhave broken it down and are getting chippy baskets. And, too,<br />\nthey can't afford to catch a team<br />\nwith extremely quick, snake-type<br />\nrebounders in the 6-5 range that's<br />\nhaving the game of its life\u2014<br />\nespecially if they catch that club<br />\non the second game of the<br />\nweekend, when big guys tend to<br />\nget lead-legged.<br />\nBut if those three abovementioned things don't occur,<br />\nthen unwrap the trophy, paint it<br />\nSky Blue, and mail it to North<br />\nCarolina.<br />\nNow, obviously, the Maestro<br />\nisn't going to like this column,<br />\nbecause it's like having your picture in SI or Time , and the next<br />\nweek everything seems to go into the minus pool or the Bronx at<br />\nFort Apache. But I also think that<br />\nDean is now leaning toward the<br />\nphilosophy of a Denny Crum or<br />\nJim Valvano.
