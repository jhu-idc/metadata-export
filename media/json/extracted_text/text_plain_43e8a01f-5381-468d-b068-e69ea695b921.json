In no other branch of athletics has she ever attained<br />\nsuperiority, hut in lacrosse she must be reckoned the equal of any team in the<br />\ncountry. The writer has been asked to say a few words on the history of the<br />\ngame at Hopkins. 1 had the honor, with three others, to organize the first<br />\nteam 1 Iol)k ins had, the others being Morrison, Roszell and Cone, whose magnificent goal keeping has never been excelled in this country and probably never<br />\nwill be. We ,were freshmen then in \"'87,\" but had had our trying out and coaching<br />\non the best lacrosse team America has ever produced. I refer, of course, to. the<br />\nfamous \"Druids.\" It was slow work getting recruits, the baseball men tried<br />\nin every way to discourage us. No money was given from the treasury, and<br />\nour only aid was the moral support given by Dr. Renouf, to whom lacrosse at<br />\nHopkins will ever owe a great debt of gratitude. C. Riggs, Princeton's \"87,\"<br />\nwas taking a P. G. course with us and he was elected captain as he had captained his Princeton team the previous year.<br />\nAt . last a team was gotten together, and a game arranged with a strong<br />\nlocal team, \"'The Pattersons.\"<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nCone.<br />\nGoal<br />\ns<br />\nRiggs.<br />\nC. \\<br />\nPoint<br />\nCover<br />\nGuggenheimer, Roszell.<br />\nDefense<br />\nCoats.<br />\nCenter<br />\nFriedenwald, McPherson, Moale.<br />\nAttack<br />\nMorrison.<br />\nOut home<br />\nLanier.<br />\nIn home<br />\neye, does<br />\nyour<br />\nsrtike<br />\nshould<br />\nthis<br />\nchance<br />\nby<br />\nif<br />\ntimers,\"<br />\n\"old<br />\nA word to you,<br />\nit make you young again to see yourselves lined up for play?

B., \"'90.\"<br />\n<br />\nATHLETICS IN THE FAR EAST.<br />\n<br />\nONSTANTINOPLE is the meeting of the Orient and the Occident. It is<br />\nreally an Oriental city, which the Occident is seeking to enter. The Orient stands for conservatism and inactivity, while activity and change characteize the Occident. This contrast applies to all spheres of life\u2014physical, mental and spiritual. Amid these conditions one would not look for much enthusiasm and activity in the athletic line ; for people generally move as though one<br />\nday were a thousand years; which is quite a contrast with America, where people<br />\ntry to crowd a thousand years into one day.<br />\nOn the shores of the Bosphorus-6 miles from Constantinople\u2014we have an<br />\nAmerican institution, Robert College ; founded by Americans, manned largely<br />\nby Americans, the object of the founders being to put a little Christian leaven<br />\n(of the American brand) into this part of the world with the hope that it may<br />\nleaven the whole lump. The trustees, recognizing the great value of the physical development in this problem, requested the author to come out and do what<br />\nhe could in this direction. Incidentally he has been teaching a little biology.<br />\nBut first a few words about the college in general. There are about three<br />\nhundred students, about equally divided between the collegiate and preparatory<br />\ndepartments. Twelve nationalities are represented, though the Greeks, Americans, and Bulgarians predominate. All of these are Christians, though unfortunately only nominally so, in a majority of cases. in point of age the students<br />\nare about two years younger than Hopkins undergraduates ; while the course of<br />\nstudy does not differ very materially from that of the University ; the large amount<br />\nof time devoted to language, and the lack of thoroughness being the chief differences.<br />\nPhysically the students are both undersized and poorly developed. Lack<br />\nof exercise, poor and insufficient food and exercise, use of tobacco appear to be<br />\nthe chief factors to account for this condition. Here it is quite common even for<br />\nthe ladies of first rank to smoke, the cigarette being their favorite.<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nA careful physical examination is made of each student, including a number of measurements and test of strength. These are recorded and filed. A<br />\nduplicate is given to each student, on which are written recommendations, which<br />\nare calculated to counteract existing defects.<br />\nWe have a gymnasium, or more properly speaking, a room in which there is<br />\nsome standard gymnastic apparatus, which the boys used last winter with a good<br />\ndeal of zest. Exercise is at present required of all the preparatory students ; but<br />\nit is optional for the college boys. At the close of the season a very creditable<br />\ngymnastic exhibition was given, the work on the parallel bars and the general class<br />\ndrill being especially good. Wrestling was one of the novel features to the peoPle. An appropriation of $10,000 has been made for the erecting of a gymnasium,<br />\nwhich will be begun this summer.<br />\nAs for athletics, football and field sports are the favorites. There is but little<br />\ninterest in baseball. The association football is the four employed. The boys<br />\n. play it with a good deal of vim, though team work is usually lacking, each one<br />\nwishing to distinguish himself by brilliant plays. The national spirit manifests<br />\nitself. Quite frequently a Greek will take the slightest provocation to twist the<br />\nnose of the Bulgarian, while the American and the Turk sometimes choose a<br />\nmatch game as a place to settle some difference.<br />\nThe boys are now training for field-day. This year we are to have two sets<br />\nof games\u2014handicap and scratch. There is usually a very good audience, both<br />\nin point of quality and size, to witness these contests. Below is appended a list<br />\nof records of the college. This year many of the records will probably be lowered,<br />\nfor already in practice about one--half of them have been smashed.<br />\nThe present records of Robert College are:<br />\n80-Yard dash<br />\n110-Yard run<br />\n880-Yard run<br />\nM ile run<br />\n80-Yard hurdle<br />\n16 lb.

The above record speaks for itself, and is one of which the<br />\nstudents of the University may justly feel elated. The high standard set by our<br />\nlacrosse teams in former years, has been fully maintained by the team during<br />\nthe past season. The coaches deserve great credit for the manner in which the<br />\nnew men were developed to fill the vacancies occasioned by last year's graduation.<br />\nThe loss was considerable, being confined entirely to old and experienced players.<br />\nIn the reappearance of Fred. Foster, who played in the championship games of<br />\n1899, and 1900, the team was especially fortunate. Of the older members of the<br />\nteam, all showed marked improvement in their play over previous years, while the<br />\nwork of the new men was most creditable and of the highest order.<br />\nOwing to sifting and trying out of the new material, it was hard to draw<br />\nmuch of a line as to the ability of the team until the Hobart game, when it was seen<br />\nthat our boys were playing the kind of game which wins championships<br />\nThe new Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association, consisting of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nSwarthmore, Lehigh and Stevens, was successful in every way. All the members<br />\nof the League worked in harmony and accord.<br />\nThe new league gained a signal success in that none of its teams were defeated by those of the Liniversity League which consists of Harvard, Cornell,<br />\nPennsylvania and Columbia.<br />\nWithout exception, the teams of the Intercollegiate Association were detidedly stronger this season than last, while some of the teams of the University<br />\nLeague also showed better form, notably Pennsylvania. It is to be hoped that this<br />\nincrease in strength will continue, as it will tend to establish the game- on a firmer<br />\nbasis amongst the colleges of this country.<br />\nI Acrosse is an ideal college sport. and the increasing popularity in the sections where it is played, is doing much to stimulate the game in other localities.<br />\nIn the past year, a number of new teams have been started, especially amongst<br />\nthe preparatory schools. This movement is being encouraged by the colloges who<br />\nhope to reap benefit in the future. The lack of men., trained in lacrosse before<br />\nentering college, has been a great drawback to the advancement of the game<br />\nin the Lnited States. The average college lacrosse player has learned the game<br />\nabout the time he is graduated, simply because at least several years are required<br />\nto get the knack of handling his stick and to master the fine points of the game.<br />\nIf this preliminary work is learned in the preparatory school, it may be predicted<br />\nthat the time will come when the American college team will successfully cope in<br />\nlacrosse with the college teams of our Canadian neighbors.<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nHP:NRY PHILIP STRAUS,<br />\n<br />\nCaptain 1903 Lacrosse Team.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the eniversity Year by the Students of THE JOHNS<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nJUNE 4.<br />\n<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br />\n<br />\nEditor in Chief, .<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editor,<br />\n.<br />\nAssistant News Editors,<br />\nAthletic Editois,<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br />\nAssistant Business Manager,<br />\n<br />\n10 Cents a single copy.<br />\n<br />\nGEORGE A.

The high position of Johns Hopkins as the<br />\nfirst University in the land has been fully maintained. The University is free<br />\nfrom all financial difficulty, and Homewood, the goal of our ambitions, draws<br />\nnearer every day.<br />\nIn other departments besides scholarship there has been the same encouraging growth. As in former years \"Hopkins Spirit\" has secured victories over<br />\ninstitutions numbering many times the l'niversity's student body. The football season though short was a successful one. The track team has had a year<br />\nof unprecedented success. Not only have many new records been made but the<br />\nmeets held by the University have set a high standard. \"Intercollegiate Champions<br />\nof the United States\" is the proud title held once again by the lacrosse team. The<br />\nmusical teams scored fresh triumpbs. Most important of all, the season was a<br />\nfinancial success. The iI90:3 \"Hullabaloo\" is one of. the best year books ever<br />\nissued, and compares very favorably with the best in the country.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n'7<br />\n<br />\nWhether or not TH1 Nms-Llirriiiz has kept pace with the other student departments, it is not for us to say here. The two boards have been hampered by<br />\nthe fact that not an the editorships were filled, but they have enjoyed the work,<br />\nand feel that they have derived considerable experience that will be valuable in<br />\nyears to come. If an increased subscription list is an indication of commendation, the board knows that its efforts have not been in vain.<br />\n<br />\nHE NEWS-LETTER takes a special pride in the two leading articles in this<br />\nissue. Dr. Berwick Lanier, '90, and Dr. C. W. Ottley, M. D., '99, did<br />\n\u2022much to advance athletics while they were at the University, and., their<br />\ninterest in Hopkins's success has not abated with the passing years. Dr. Lanier Was<br />\na member of the first Varsity lacrosse team, and he has continued to follow the<br />\ngame from year to year, and though various changes in the style of play have<br />\ntaken place since the first Hopkins team, yet Dr. Lanier has kept abreast of these,<br />\nand has always cheerfully given the team whatever aid he could. Dr. ()aim<br />\nfrom the time he entered the Me.dical School until his graduation four years ago,<br />\nwas one of the stars of the track team, and, indeed, one of the best athletes who<br />\never brought success to the \"I hack and Blue.\" The splendid work that he is doing in far away Turkey is a matter of pride to his many friends. That he is just<br />\nas enthusiastic an athlete as ever is proved by his account of how he has got the<br />\nTurk to take an interest in track and field sports.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nSATURDAY'S GAME WITH TORONTO.<br />\nSaturday afternoon, at Oriole Park, the University lacrosse team will meet<br />\nthe champion Toronto team, in the last and greatest game of the season. The<br />\nCanadians, who hold the intercollegiate championship of the Dominion, are coining to Baltimore prepared for the hardest sort of a contest. The Varsity team<br />\nhas .kept in practice since the game with the Crescents, though the I. Tniversity examinations have been a great strain upon the men. Some of the faults and misplays<br />\nwhich were prominent in the Crescent game will hardly occur again, as the coaches<br />\nhave given special attention to these.. The players realize that their abilities will<br />\nbe tested to the utmost, and are training accordingly. Toronto's team numbers<br />\nonly three of last year's twelve, but nearly all the other players have been associated with sonic well known lacrosse team before they entered the University of<br />\nToronto.<br />\nAccording to present indications the record breaking crowd at last year's game<br />\n\\vill be surpassed on Saturday. Mayor McLane has promised to attend. Gov.<br />\nSmith, and the other State officials will also be present.

Weedon,<br />\none of our cracks, both in the jumps and in the sprints, had graduated, and<br />\nthe same might be said of Bill Hoffman, one of the best middle distance men in<br />\ncollege, and a member of the Relay Team, and Riggs, another Relay man, had to<br />\ngive up on account of medical work.. These three and some others were the<br />\nprincipal losses, and it only left two men on the Relay, and the team .in general<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nin poor condition.<br />\nkarly in the fall the raw freshman material was gotten out, with hopes that<br />\na few good ones could be found to take the place of those who we lost, and also<br />\nwe sent. a circular letter to many of the incoming medical men. As a result of<br />\nthis letter, such men as Freese, 'Helmholtz and Sladen responded.<br />\nOn the first of J ai wary the regular season began, and for some time it looked<br />\nas if the team would never get in trim, but finally it did, and the undergraduate<br />\nmembers showed up every well in the Inter-Class Meet, which was held in the<br />\n<br />\n\f18<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nCage in the last week of January. The Seniors won in a walk-over, but very<br />\nfew points separated the Juniors and the Freshmen. This meet was an innovation at the University, and I hope it will be continued in the years to come.<br />\nNow when this was over, we had two weeks to prepare for the 13. A. C.<br />\nindoor Meet, which was held on February 14th, at 8 P. M. This was a handicap<br />\nmeet, and Hopkins on the majority of points. Helmholtz won the dash and<br />\nbroad jump in fine style, and Lawson took first place in the shot and second in<br />\nthe high jump, first place in the latter event to Scholl. We took a number of<br />\nseconds and thirds, and from a point of view of points scored we certainly got our<br />\nshare.<br />\nThe next meet was Georgetown's annual affair, which took place on March<br />\n7th, and we won the event which we most desired, that is the Relay race with<br />\nVilla Nova, and the team showed up very well, running in the following order:<br />\nStone, Capt. Hoffman, Freese and England. Each one of these men gained considerably on his opponent. Besides the Relay, Freeze took second in the hurdle.<br />\nOn March 28th came the Hopkins Meet at the Armory, and from every point<br />\nof view it was a great success. Duffy, the Georgetown champion, ran an exhibition 35 yard dash, and did it in 4 seconds, breaking the state record. Everything was Hopkins that night and the men deserve much credit as they had<br />\nhandicaps, etc., to overcome. Tootle took both the dashes and the 440 in fine style,<br />\nEngland was third in the mile, Hoffman second in the half-mile, and Freeze first<br />\nin the hurdle. Altogether the team did splendid work.<br />\nThe next question was the Pennsylvania Relay Races. En years previous<br />\nwe had run the Maryland colleges, and had beaten them regularly, so this year<br />\nwhen we had a chance to go higher up in classes, we took it, and we never did a<br />\nbetter thing, for instead of only going up One class, we were put in the Middle<br />\nStates Championship Class. This meant that we should have to run ; so hard<br />\ntraining began and continued right along till the time to go to Philadelphia arrived.<br />\nThis was a hard race, and we ft)nght hard for it, but missed first place by a few<br />\nyards, being beaten by Bucknell in 3.39. The time was faster than the figures<br />\nindicated, as the track was very slow. The team was composed of Freese, Hoffman, England and Tootle, With Stone as substitute.<br />\nNow we arrive at the grand climax of the year, the Dual Meet with Virginia.<br />\nThis meet had been worked up since January, and was considered by all to be the<br />\ngreatest movement in track athletics that the University ever had. This memorable event took place at Electric Park on May 7th. The Virginia team was in<br />\nfine trim and ours the same. Tootle did splendid work in both the 100 and 220,<br />\nwinning in 10 sec. and 22 sec. respectively.<br />\nIn the mile two J. H. U. Freshmen showed to the front. Morse heating<br />\nCampbell by about 6 inches. In the jumps Scholl and Pessagno won points in<br />\nfine form, and Freese took the hurdles and Emig the pole vault. The 110 was<br />\nthe hardest race of the day, and England who was counted on to win was ill, but<br />\ngamely fought on till he fell, after this it was between Shelton, of Virginia, and<br />\nHoffman, J. H. U., the former winning by about 2 feet in iS1.l sec. The half mile<br />\nand shot went to Virginia, but Stone did fine work in the latter. The whole meet<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n19<br />\n<br />\nwas a great success, and Johns Ilopkins won it handily by 55 points to 33. This<br />\npractically ended the season, except for the men who went to the Intercollegiates.<br />\nIn the latter, the men just missed qualifying.<br />\nIn summing up the year on a whole I think it was _a great success, and too<br />\nmuch credit can not be given to the men who have done their best for Johns I lopkins, and I hope that future teams will be as successful and earnest in their<br />\nwork as the team of 1903.<br />\nR.

In no other branch of athletics has she ever attained<br />\nsuperiority, hut in lacrosse she must be reckoned the equal of any team in the<br />\ncountry. The writer has been asked to say a few words on the history of the<br />\ngame at Hopkins. 1 had the honor, with three others, to organize the first<br />\nteam 1 Iol)k ins had, the others being Morrison, Roszell and Cone, whose magnificent goal keeping has never been excelled in this country and probably never<br />\nwill be. We ,were freshmen then in \"'87,\" but had had our trying out and coaching<br />\non the best lacrosse team America has ever produced. I refer, of course, to. the<br />\nfamous \"Druids.\" It was slow work getting recruits, the baseball men tried<br />\nin every way to discourage us. No money was given from the treasury, and<br />\nour only aid was the moral support given by Dr. Renouf, to whom lacrosse at<br />\nHopkins will ever owe a great debt of gratitude. C. Riggs, Princeton's \"87,\"<br />\nwas taking a P. G. course with us and he was elected captain as he had captained his Princeton team the previous year.<br />\nAt . last a team was gotten together, and a game arranged with a strong<br />\nlocal team, \"'The Pattersons.\"<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nCone.<br />\nGoal<br />\ns<br />\nRiggs.<br />\nC. \\<br />\nPoint<br />\nCover<br />\nGuggenheimer, Roszell.<br />\nDefense<br />\nCoats.<br />\nCenter<br />\nFriedenwald, McPherson, Moale.<br />\nAttack<br />\nMorrison.<br />\nOut home<br />\nLanier.<br />\nIn home<br />\neye, does<br />\nyour<br />\nsrtike<br />\nshould<br />\nthis<br />\nchance<br />\nby<br />\nif<br />\ntimers,\"<br />\n\"old<br />\nA word to you,<br />\nit make you young again to see yourselves lined up for play?

B., \"'90.\"<br /><br />\nATHLETICS IN THE FAR EAST.<br /><br />\nONSTANTINOPLE is the meeting of the Orient and the Occident. It is<br />\nreally an Oriental city, which the Occident is seeking to enter. The Orient stands for conservatism and inactivity, while activity and change characteize the Occident. This contrast applies to all spheres of life\u2014physical, mental and spiritual. Amid these conditions one would not look for much enthusiasm and activity in the athletic line ; for people generally move as though one<br />\nday were a thousand years; which is quite a contrast with America, where people<br />\ntry to crowd a thousand years into one day.<br />\nOn the shores of the Bosphorus-6 miles from Constantinople\u2014we have an<br />\nAmerican institution, Robert College ; founded by Americans, manned largely<br />\nby Americans, the object of the founders being to put a little Christian leaven<br />\n(of the American brand) into this part of the world with the hope that it may<br />\nleaven the whole lump. The trustees, recognizing the great value of the physical development in this problem, requested the author to come out and do what<br />\nhe could in this direction. Incidentally he has been teaching a little biology.<br />\nBut first a few words about the college in general. There are about three<br />\nhundred students, about equally divided between the collegiate and preparatory<br />\ndepartments. Twelve nationalities are represented, though the Greeks, Americans, and Bulgarians predominate. All of these are Christians, though unfortunately only nominally so, in a majority of cases. in point of age the students<br />\nare about two years younger than Hopkins undergraduates ; while the course of<br />\nstudy does not differ very materially from that of the University ; the large amount<br />\nof time devoted to language, and the lack of thoroughness being the chief differences.<br />\nPhysically the students are both undersized and poorly developed. Lack<br />\nof exercise, poor and insufficient food and exercise, use of tobacco appear to be<br />\nthe chief factors to account for this condition. Here it is quite common even for<br />\nthe ladies of first rank to smoke, the cigarette being their favorite.<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nA careful physical examination is made of each student, including a number of measurements and test of strength. These are recorded and filed. A<br />\nduplicate is given to each student, on which are written recommendations, which<br />\nare calculated to counteract existing defects.<br />\nWe have a gymnasium, or more properly speaking, a room in which there is<br />\nsome standard gymnastic apparatus, which the boys used last winter with a good<br />\ndeal of zest. Exercise is at present required of all the preparatory students ; but<br />\nit is optional for the college boys. At the close of the season a very creditable<br />\ngymnastic exhibition was given, the work on the parallel bars and the general class<br />\ndrill being especially good. Wrestling was one of the novel features to the peoPle. An appropriation of $10,000 has been made for the erecting of a gymnasium,<br />\nwhich will be begun this summer.<br />\nAs for athletics, football and field sports are the favorites. There is but little<br />\ninterest in baseball. The association football is the four employed. The boys<br />\n. play it with a good deal of vim, though team work is usually lacking, each one<br />\nwishing to distinguish himself by brilliant plays. The national spirit manifests<br />\nitself. Quite frequently a Greek will take the slightest provocation to twist the<br />\nnose of the Bulgarian, while the American and the Turk sometimes choose a<br />\nmatch game as a place to settle some difference.<br />\nThe boys are now training for field-day. This year we are to have two sets<br />\nof games\u2014handicap and scratch. There is usually a very good audience, both<br />\nin point of quality and size, to witness these contests. Below is appended a list<br />\nof records of the college. This year many of the records will probably be lowered,<br />\nfor already in practice about one--half of them have been smashed.<br />\nThe present records of Robert College are:<br />\n80-Yard dash<br />\n110-Yard run<br />\n880-Yard run<br />\nM ile run<br />\n80-Yard hurdle<br />\n16 lb.

The above record speaks for itself, and is one of which the<br />\nstudents of the University may justly feel elated. The high standard set by our<br />\nlacrosse teams in former years, has been fully maintained by the team during<br />\nthe past season. The coaches deserve great credit for the manner in which the<br />\nnew men were developed to fill the vacancies occasioned by last year's graduation.<br />\nThe loss was considerable, being confined entirely to old and experienced players.<br />\nIn the reappearance of Fred. Foster, who played in the championship games of<br />\n1899, and 1900, the team was especially fortunate. Of the older members of the<br />\nteam, all showed marked improvement in their play over previous years, while the<br />\nwork of the new men was most creditable and of the highest order.<br />\nOwing to sifting and trying out of the new material, it was hard to draw<br />\nmuch of a line as to the ability of the team until the Hobart game, when it was seen<br />\nthat our boys were playing the kind of game which wins championships<br />\nThe new Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association, consisting of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nSwarthmore, Lehigh and Stevens, was successful in every way. All the members<br />\nof the League worked in harmony and accord.<br />\nThe new league gained a signal success in that none of its teams were defeated by those of the Liniversity League which consists of Harvard, Cornell,<br />\nPennsylvania and Columbia.<br />\nWithout exception, the teams of the Intercollegiate Association were detidedly stronger this season than last, while some of the teams of the University<br />\nLeague also showed better form, notably Pennsylvania. It is to be hoped that this<br />\nincrease in strength will continue, as it will tend to establish the game- on a firmer<br />\nbasis amongst the colleges of this country.<br />\nI Acrosse is an ideal college sport. and the increasing popularity in the sections where it is played, is doing much to stimulate the game in other localities.<br />\nIn the past year, a number of new teams have been started, especially amongst<br />\nthe preparatory schools. This movement is being encouraged by the colloges who<br />\nhope to reap benefit in the future. The lack of men., trained in lacrosse before<br />\nentering college, has been a great drawback to the advancement of the game<br />\nin the Lnited States. The average college lacrosse player has learned the game<br />\nabout the time he is graduated, simply because at least several years are required<br />\nto get the knack of handling his stick and to master the fine points of the game.<br />\nIf this preliminary work is learned in the preparatory school, it may be predicted<br />\nthat the time will come when the American college team will successfully cope in<br />\nlacrosse with the college teams of our Canadian neighbors.<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nHP:NRY PHILIP STRAUS,<br /><br />\nCaptain 1903 Lacrosse Team.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the eniversity Year by the Students of THE JOHNS<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nJUNE 4.<br /><br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br /><br />\nEditor in Chief, .<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editor,<br />\n.<br />\nAssistant News Editors,<br />\nAthletic Editois,<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br />\nAssistant Business Manager,<br /><br />\n10 Cents a single copy.<br /><br />\nGEORGE A.

U.; or box 398, Medical Department of the Johns Hopkins University.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\n1.IE close of the Twenty-seventh Academic Year of the Johns Hopkins University marks a time to pause and reflect on the work of the past year.<br />\nThis task is a most agreeable one, since all departments of the University have registered a steady growth.. The high position of Johns Hopkins as the<br />\nfirst University in the land has been fully maintained. The University is free<br />\nfrom all financial difficulty, and Homewood, the goal of our ambitions, draws<br />\nnearer every day.<br />\nIn other departments besides scholarship there has been the same encouraging growth. As in former years \"Hopkins Spirit\" has secured victories over<br />\ninstitutions numbering many times the l'niversity's student body. The football season though short was a successful one. The track team has had a year<br />\nof unprecedented success. Not only have many new records been made but the<br />\nmeets held by the University have set a high standard. \"Intercollegiate Champions<br />\nof the United States\" is the proud title held once again by the lacrosse team. The<br />\nmusical teams scored fresh triumpbs. Most important of all, the season was a<br />\nfinancial success. The iI90:3 \"Hullabaloo\" is one of. the best year books ever<br />\nissued, and compares very favorably with the best in the country.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n'7<br /><br />\nWhether or not TH1 Nms-Llirriiiz has kept pace with the other student departments, it is not for us to say here. The two boards have been hampered by<br />\nthe fact that not an the editorships were filled, but they have enjoyed the work,<br />\nand feel that they have derived considerable experience that will be valuable in<br />\nyears to come. If an increased subscription list is an indication of commendation, the board knows that its efforts have not been in vain.<br /><br />\nHE NEWS-LETTER takes a special pride in the two leading articles in this<br />\nissue. Dr. Berwick Lanier, '90, and Dr. C. W. Ottley, M. D., '99, did<br />\n\u2022much to advance athletics while they were at the University, and., their<br />\ninterest in Hopkins's success has not abated with the passing years. Dr. Lanier Was<br />\na member of the first Varsity lacrosse team, and he has continued to follow the<br />\ngame from year to year, and though various changes in the style of play have<br />\ntaken place since the first Hopkins team, yet Dr. Lanier has kept abreast of these,<br />\nand has always cheerfully given the team whatever aid he could. Dr. ()aim<br />\nfrom the time he entered the Me.dical School until his graduation four years ago,<br />\nwas one of the stars of the track team, and, indeed, one of the best athletes who<br />\never brought success to the \"I hack and Blue.\" The splendid work that he is doing in far away Turkey is a matter of pride to his many friends. That he is just<br />\nas enthusiastic an athlete as ever is proved by his account of how he has got the<br />\nTurk to take an interest in track and field sports.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nSATURDAY'S GAME WITH TORONTO.<br />\nSaturday afternoon, at Oriole Park, the University lacrosse team will meet<br />\nthe champion Toronto team, in the last and greatest game of the season. The<br />\nCanadians, who hold the intercollegiate championship of the Dominion, are coining to Baltimore prepared for the hardest sort of a contest. The Varsity team<br />\nhas .kept in practice since the game with the Crescents, though the I. Tniversity examinations have been a great strain upon the men. Some of the faults and misplays<br />\nwhich were prominent in the Crescent game will hardly occur again, as the coaches<br />\nhave given special attention to these.. The players realize that their abilities will<br />\nbe tested to the utmost, and are training accordingly. Toronto's team numbers<br />\nonly three of last year's twelve, but nearly all the other players have been associated with sonic well known lacrosse team before they entered the University of<br />\nToronto.<br />\nAccording to present indications the record breaking crowd at last year's game<br />\n\\vill be surpassed on Saturday. Mayor McLane has promised to attend. Gov.<br />\nSmith, and the other State officials will also be present.

Weedon,<br />\none of our cracks, both in the jumps and in the sprints, had graduated, and<br />\nthe same might be said of Bill Hoffman, one of the best middle distance men in<br />\ncollege, and a member of the Relay Team, and Riggs, another Relay man, had to<br />\ngive up on account of medical work.. These three and some others were the<br />\nprincipal losses, and it only left two men on the Relay, and the team .in general<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nin poor condition.<br />\nkarly in the fall the raw freshman material was gotten out, with hopes that<br />\na few good ones could be found to take the place of those who we lost, and also<br />\nwe sent. a circular letter to many of the incoming medical men. As a result of<br />\nthis letter, such men as Freese, 'Helmholtz and Sladen responded.<br />\nOn the first of J ai wary the regular season began, and for some time it looked<br />\nas if the team would never get in trim, but finally it did, and the undergraduate<br />\nmembers showed up every well in the Inter-Class Meet, which was held in the<br /><br />\n18<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\nCage in the last week of January. The Seniors won in a walk-over, but very<br />\nfew points separated the Juniors and the Freshmen. This meet was an innovation at the University, and I hope it will be continued in the years to come.<br />\nNow when this was over, we had two weeks to prepare for the 13. A. C.<br />\nindoor Meet, which was held on February 14th, at 8 P. M. This was a handicap<br />\nmeet, and Hopkins on the majority of points. Helmholtz won the dash and<br />\nbroad jump in fine style, and Lawson took first place in the shot and second in<br />\nthe high jump, first place in the latter event to Scholl. We took a number of<br />\nseconds and thirds, and from a point of view of points scored we certainly got our<br />\nshare.<br />\nThe next meet was Georgetown's annual affair, which took place on March<br />\n7th, and we won the event which we most desired, that is the Relay race with<br />\nVilla Nova, and the team showed up very well, running in the following order:<br />\nStone, Capt. Hoffman, Freese and England. Each one of these men gained considerably on his opponent. Besides the Relay, Freeze took second in the hurdle.<br />\nOn March 28th came the Hopkins Meet at the Armory, and from every point<br />\nof view it was a great success. Duffy, the Georgetown champion, ran an exhibition 35 yard dash, and did it in 4 seconds, breaking the state record. Everything was Hopkins that night and the men deserve much credit as they had<br />\nhandicaps, etc., to overcome. Tootle took both the dashes and the 440 in fine style,<br />\nEngland was third in the mile, Hoffman second in the half-mile, and Freeze first<br />\nin the hurdle. Altogether the team did splendid work.<br />\nThe next question was the Pennsylvania Relay Races. En years previous<br />\nwe had run the Maryland colleges, and had beaten them regularly, so this year<br />\nwhen we had a chance to go higher up in classes, we took it, and we never did a<br />\nbetter thing, for instead of only going up One class, we were put in the Middle<br />\nStates Championship Class. This meant that we should have to run ; so hard<br />\ntraining began and continued right along till the time to go to Philadelphia arrived.<br />\nThis was a hard race, and we ft)nght hard for it, but missed first place by a few<br />\nyards, being beaten by Bucknell in 3.39. The time was faster than the figures<br />\nindicated, as the track was very slow. The team was composed of Freese, Hoffman, England and Tootle, With Stone as substitute.<br />\nNow we arrive at the grand climax of the year, the Dual Meet with Virginia.<br />\nThis meet had been worked up since January, and was considered by all to be the<br />\ngreatest movement in track athletics that the University ever had. This memorable event took place at Electric Park on May 7th. The Virginia team was in<br />\nfine trim and ours the same. Tootle did splendid work in both the 100 and 220,<br />\nwinning in 10 sec. and 22 sec. respectively.<br />\nIn the mile two J. H. U. Freshmen showed to the front. Morse heating<br />\nCampbell by about 6 inches. In the jumps Scholl and Pessagno won points in<br />\nfine form, and Freese took the hurdles and Emig the pole vault. The 110 was<br />\nthe hardest race of the day, and England who was counted on to win was ill, but<br />\ngamely fought on till he fell, after this it was between Shelton, of Virginia, and<br />\nHoffman, J. H. U., the former winning by about 2 feet in iS1.l sec. The half mile<br />\nand shot went to Virginia, but Stone did fine work in the latter. The whole meet<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n19<br /><br />\nwas a great success, and Johns Ilopkins won it handily by 55 points to 33. This<br />\npractically ended the season, except for the men who went to the Intercollegiates.<br />\nIn the latter, the men just missed qualifying.<br />\nIn summing up the year on a whole I think it was _a great success, and too<br />\nmuch credit can not be given to the men who have done their best for Johns I lopkins, and I hope that future teams will be as successful and earnest in their<br />\nwork as the team of 1903.<br />\nR.
