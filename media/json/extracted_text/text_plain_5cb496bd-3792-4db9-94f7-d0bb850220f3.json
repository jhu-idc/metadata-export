I had received a letter from President Steven Muller in early - August, detailing a<br />\nweekend of informal discussions to be held on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Fifty persons-administrators,<br />\nfaculty members, and students were invited. But the<br />\nlast retreat took place when Milton S. Eisenhower was<br />\nUniversity President. So no one really knew what was<br />\ngoing to happen.<br />\nPeople were asked to arrive before five Friday. Some<br />\nstudents decided to take the Student Council van while<br />\ncont. on pg. 10<br />\n<br />\nOne speaker has been confirmed for this November's<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Symposium, according to cochairmen Dan Lavery and Paul<br />\nRubery.<br />\nRubery and Lavery have<br />\ntried to attract prominent<br />\nindividuals in the foreign<br />\npolicymaking field. To date,<br />\nthey have not been able to confirm who their first three<br />\nspeakers will be. But their<br />\nfourth speaker will be former<br />\nEcuadoran and O.A.S. President Gabo Plaza, who recently<br />\nsubmitted an extensive report<br />\non Central America to the Kissinger Commission.<br />\nAccording to Rubery, he is<br />\none of the \"leading living<br />\nauthorities\" on Latin America<br />\nand will discuss American<br />\nforeign policy prospects in the<br />\nregion.<br />\nAs Rubery put it, \"The invitation process is both delicate<br />\nand complex, and for this<br />\nreason it's been very hard to get<br />\n<br />\nany 'big names' to confirm that<br />\nthey will be able to speak.<br />\nHowever, we are going to continue as long as possible to<br />\nwork on these persons.\"<br />\nThis year's topic, \"The<br />\nDynamics of Foreign Policy: Is<br />\nthe U.S. Compromising a<br />\nDelicate Balance?\" \u2018% ill tentatively be divided into four in-<br />\n<br />\ndividual lectures on key areas of<br />\nAmerican foreign policy interest including NATO, the<br />\nMiddle East, the U.S.S.R. and<br />\nChina, and Latin America. The<br />\nfour lectures are expected to<br />\ntake place on successive<br />\nThursdays in November.<br />\nThe symposium's projected<br />\nbudget for this year is $27,(XX),<br />\nmost of which will to honoraria<br />\nfor speaker/speaker's fees. Student Council donated $10,(XX)<br />\nof this amount, and the cochairmen raised \u00b617,000<br />\nthrough assorted fundraising<br />\nactivities over the summer. At<br />\nthis point, the uncertainty over<br />\nspeakers is due to scheduling<br />\nrather<br />\nthan<br />\nfinancial<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Steers<br />\n<br />\n.

The University<br />\ngenerally did not have sufficient<br />\nfunds to help both its own<br />\nundergraduates and transfers,<br />\nso the transfers weren't given<br />\nfinancial aid. They were seen as<br />\na group who \"had the option of<br />\nreturning to their former institiutions,\" Broadbent said.<br />\nRecently, however, this has<br />\nchanged. Beginning this year,<br />\nthe administration decided to<br />\nallow transfers to be considered<br />\nfor financial aid, Broadbent<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAlthough transfers are not<br />\neligible for merit-based aid,<br />\nthey are considered in the same<br />\npool as other students when aid<br />\nis allotted, according to<br />\nAssociated Dean of Administration C. Norman<br />\nKrueger.<br />\nGenerally, a first-year<br />\ntransfer student won't receive a<br />\nfinancial aid package that is<br />\ncomparable to that of incoming<br />\nfreshmen or returning upperclassmen, Broadbent said.<br />\nThe self-help portion is usually<br />\nlarger for transfer students, she<br />\n<br />\nadded. All transfers are expected to take out a $2,500<br />\nGuaranteed Student Loan,<br />\nsomething which is not required<br />\nof other students. However, in<br />\nthe second and subsequent<br />\nyears, according to Broadbent,<br />\nfinancial aid packages for<br />\ntransfers are comparable to<br />\nthose of other students.<br />\nHopkins is also admitting<br />\nmore transfers. This year,<br />\nHopkins has approximately 50<br />\ntransfers, 25 percent more than<br />\nlast year, according to Jerome<br />\nSchnydman, Director of<br />\nUndergraduate Admissions.<br />\n\"There is room in a number<br />\nof classes,\" Schnydman said.<br />\n\"Although the attrition rate at<br />\nHopkins is very low, there<br />\nnevertheless are a few students<br />\nwho withdraw, and these spaces<br />\nmust be filled.\"<br />\nUpperclass courses tend not<br />\nto be filled, Schnydman said.<br />\nTherefore, by accepting<br />\ntransfer students, who enter the<br />\nUniversity directly at the upperclass level, the University is<br />\nmaking better use of its faculty<br />\nand resources.<br />\nWhen research was conducted to find out how transfer<br />\nstudents performed here<br />\nacademically, it was found that<br />\nmost were very successful,<br />\nSchnydman said. Some<br />\nstudents transferred because<br />\nthey experienced difficulties at,<br />\nor were dissatisfied with, their<br />\nformer schools. Primarily,<br />\n<br />\nIll<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\nhowever, students applied to<br />\ntransfer to Hopkins because<br />\nthey found that they were attracted by its academic quality,<br />\nits small size, its researchoriented curriculum, or its<br />\noverall atmosphere, noted<br />\nSchnydman.<br />\n<br />\n.Ak<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n..,,<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n'<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nTransfer students, for the<br />\nmost part, have characteristics<br />\nthat are similar to those of<br />\nstuents who apply directly out<br />\nof high school. Students who<br />\nwant to transfer are carefully<br />\nscreened: Those who wish to<br />\napply for transfer admission<br />\nmust first submit a preliminary<br />\napplication, which is free. If approved, the student is sent a<br />\nmore detailed application, for<br />\nwhich there is a fee.<br />\nWhen receiving a transfer application, the admissions office<br />\nlooks for a student who has<br />\nspent at least two years at an accredited college and has taken<br />\ncourses similar in content,<br />\nscope, and difficulty to those<br />\noffered at Hopkins, Schnydman said. The student must<br />\nhave received grades of C or<br />\nbetter in these courses and must<br />\nhave maintained an overall<br />\nGPA of at least 3.0 to be admitted. The SAT or ACT is also required. The student's academic<br />\nrecord at his or her previous<br />\ncollege is perhaps the most important set of credentials that<br />\nthe admissions staff considers<br />\nwhen making a decision on a<br />\nfransfer, according to Schnydman.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022'<br />\n<br />\n\u2014 --<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n4.'.<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\nJohn Steers<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore citizens went to polling booths like these in the Homewood<br />\nFriends Meeting Hall Tuesda to vote in the cil-wide Democratic<br />\nprimar).

Leys is concerned that med schools have<br />\nbecome so swamped with applications that it isn't possible for<br />\nthem to pay close enough attention to each applicant.<br />\nThe result, she said, is the<br />\noveruse of quantitative measures such as the MCAT at the<br />\n<br />\nexpense of more humanistic<br />\nmeasures such as essays, recommendations, and interviews. At<br />\nthe very worst, she said, she<br />\nfears that \"some medical<br />\nschools rely solely on a standardized test\" in evaluating applicants.<br />\nStudents often respond to<br />\nthis .situation by placing too<br />\nmuch emphasis on the MCAT,<br />\nLeys said. \"My philosophy is<br />\nthat students should be realistic<br />\nin preparing for the MCAT,<br />\nbut it shouldn't be given excessive weight,\" she said.<br />\nShe expressed worry that<br />\nsome pre-meds spend so much<br />\ntime preparing for the MCAT<br />\nthat they forego taking courses<br />\nthey may enjoy only because<br />\n<br />\nthey wouldn't improve their<br />\nMCAT scores. Also, between<br />\n60 to 70 percent of pre-meds<br />\nnationwide spent over $300<br />\neach last year for classes which<br />\nsupposedly would increase their<br />\nchances of doing well on the<br />\ntest.<br />\nGiven these problems, Leys<br />\nasked, what is the predictive<br />\nvalue of the MCAT? While<br />\nnoting that a direct relationship<br />\nbetween MCAT scores and performance in the basic medical<br />\nschool science courses has been<br />\nestablished, she pointed out<br />\nthat \"the MCAT does not test<br />\na sthdent's ability to deal with<br />\nthe gray areas that arise in a<br />\nphysician's work.\"<br />\n<br />\nLeys said she fears that some compare a student with a 4.0<br />\nmed schools may not be sen- GPA from a small school<br />\nto a<br />\nsitive enough to those charac- student with a 3.5 from<br />\nHopteristics which, on the surface, kins?\"<br />\ndon't relate to being a good<br />\nWhen asked if anything can<br />\ndoctor.

The game is<br />\ncalled aerial electronic sui-veillance, and it isn't for amateurs.<br />\nFrom Eielson Air Force Base<br />\nnear Fairbanks, Alaska, and<br />\nShemya Air Force Base at the<br />\nWestern tip of the Aleutian<br />\nIslands, Air Force and Navy<br />\naircraft routinely set out on<br />\nreconnaissance missions near or<br />\nover the Soviet Union's Eastern<br />\nedge. Data collected on these<br />\nflights (called ELINT for electronic intelligence) accumulate<br />\nin supercomputers managed by<br />\nthe National Security Agency<br />\n(NSA) at Fort Meade, Md.,<br />\namong other locations. In his<br />\nSept. 5 address to the nation,<br />\nPresident Reagan admitted that<br />\na reconnaissance plane had<br />\ntrailed KAL 007, but that it had<br />\nreturned to Alaska prior to the<br />\nSoviet attack.<br />\nMeanwile, U.S. military aircraft also traverse Soviet airspace, just as the Russians do<br />\nours, to test the range and frequency of radar on the ground.<br />\nAlthough satellites and radar<br />\ninstallations in Japan and other<br />\ncountries are undertaking an increased surveillance burden, the<br />\nU.S. is soon expected to make<br />\nadditions to its electronic<br />\nsquadrons. For example, ESystems, of Dallas, Texas, is<br />\ndeveloping a pilotless drone<br />\nthat will be 'able to accomplish<br />\nany number of tasks before its<br />\nlikely destruction by antiaircraft missiles. Israel demonstrated the drone's capabilities<br />\nduring its confrontation with<br />\nSyria in Lebanon last year.<br />\nAmerica's investment in electronic surveillance technology,<br />\nfor which the Reagan administration is seeking $4.7 billion in<br />\n1984, may seem worth every<br />\npenny after last week's air atrocity. Yet, it might be heading<br />\nthe U.S. and the Soviets toward<br />\nmore deadly, unnecessary incidents in the future. Xs James<br />\nBamford, author of the Puzzle Palace, a book about.the<br />\nNSA, said last week, \"The<br />\ntruth is that at any moment this<br />\nwhole game of electronic sur-<br />\n<br />\nveillance can blow up.

Over<br />\nthe past four years, U.S aid to<br />\nEl Salvador, including loans,<br />\nhas totaled only $1.3 billion.<br />\nThe $110 million the Administration requested for military<br />\nassistance in the current fiscal<br />\nyear would service our national<br />\ndebt for only 11 hours. Congress has agreed to $81.3<br />\nmillion.<br />\nWickwire implied that U.S.<br />\naid was strengthening the rightist elements in Salvadoran society. Yet, starting with the<br />\nCarter administration, U.S.<br />\npolicy has consciously sought to<br />\nbreak the power of the oligarchy and remove the sources of<br />\npopular grievances. For this<br />\nreason, the U.S. pressed for<br />\nelections and land reform, both<br />\nof which the right opposed.<br />\nU.S. pressure resulted in<br />\nMagana, a highly respected<br />\nmoderate, becoming president<br />\nof the Constitutional Assembly<br />\ninstead of the fascist D'Aubuisson. And while the number of<br />\ncivilians killed is still high, the<br />\nnumber of deaths last year was<br />\nreduced by half, thanks to Administration policy that has<br />\nstressed the link between aid<br />\nand human rights.<br />\nProgress against the insurgents has been slow but<br />\nsteady. Under U.S. tutelage,<br />\nthe Salvadoran Army's morale<br />\nhas improved and they are now<br />\nbeginning to adopt aggressive<br />\nanti-guerilla tactics. The<br />\ngovernment has coordinated its<br />\nmilitary presence with programs in health, education,<br />\nagriculture, and transportation<br />\nto retain the area's loyalty, and<br />\nthey are beginning to work.<br />\nRueben Zamoro, the political<br />\nleader of the leftist guerillas,<br />\nhas acknowledged that if U.S.<br />\naid continues, the rebels can no<br />\nlonger hope to win.<br />\nThe Wickwires of this world<br />\nunfortunately have little patience for this type of strategy.<br />\nBecause the U.S. refuses, both<br />\nmorally and pragmatically, to<br />\nsupport the radical quick-fix,<br />\n<br />\nThe Sunday Experience officially began September 11<br />\nwith a presentation by Chester<br />\nWickwire on his impressions of<br />\nNicaragua and El Salvador. I<br />\nhad gone hoping to hear a<br />\nbalanced, and at least semiobjective account of the political and military situation in<br />\nboth Of these troubled nations.<br />\nInstead, I was subjected to a<br />\nbiased and distorted description<br />\nthat seriously puts to question<br />\nWickwire's intellectual honesty<br />\nand his true commitment to the<br />\nliberal ideals he espouses.<br />\nWickwire's views are, sadly<br />\nenough, held by many in the<br />\nU.S. Like most liberals, he<br />\nbelieves that the U.S. in El<br />\nSalvador is supporting a repressive regime at war with its own<br />\npeople, and that Washington is<br />\npursuing a purely military approach to political and economic problems. He believes we<br />\nshould end all military aid and<br />\nsend El Salvador our regrets<br />\nbecause the struggle between<br />\nthe \"fascist\" right and the<br />\n\"progressive\" left is internal<br />\nand not a question of East vs.<br />\nWest.<br />\nAs for Nicaragua, Wickwire<br />\nbelieves that the Sandinistas are<br />\ntrue social reformers dedicated<br />\nto helping the poor and the oppressed. Their increasing reliance on Cuba and the U.S.S.R.<br />\nis not the fault of MarxistLeninists but U.S. aggression.<br />\nFurthermore, the Sandinistas<br />\ndo not seek to export revolution<br />\nnor to destabilize their neighbors. This is a myth perpetrated<br />\nby the Reagan Administration<br />\nin order to justify its military<br />\naid to the \"contras\", mostly<br />\nSamocistas, whom it would like<br />\nto see regain power.<br />\nUnfortunately, Wickwire's<br />\nhalf-baked assumptions are<br />\ncompletely at odds with the<br />\nfacts. Consider El Salvador.<br />\nFirst, three out of every four<br />\ndollars we give to El Salvador<br />\nis economic aid, especially for<br />\nprograms such as land reform<br />\nand education. Most of the military aid goes into teaching<br />\ntrigger-happy conscripts how to<br />\nbecome disciplined soldiers.<br />\n<br />\nMed ffNcToititt..<br />\n<br />\n:\"tdcke.v1 Cc4vmEroMi<br />\n<br />\nNAME<br />\n<br />\n\\S lomuS<br />\n<br />\nHOCK' N.5..

It was run by one man<br />\nfrom that organization, whose<br />\nretirement this past August at<br />\nthe age of seventy-five precipitated the recent changes in<br />\nKDH administration. The National Council for Young Israel<br />\nhas not ceased to provide funding, but, Kaye said, as of<br />\nAugust the administration of<br />\nthe KDH was \"dropped in the<br />\nlap of the Jewish Community<br />\nCenter.\" This situation constituted what Kaye called the<br />\n\"small crisis.\" It was resolved,<br />\n<br />\nhe said, through the diligent<br />\n\"work and attention\" of the<br />\nJCC, University administrators<br />\nsuch as Bettye Miller of the Office of the Auxiliary Enterprises, and John Hattersley of<br />\nARA.<br />\nThe responsibility of administering the KDH. Kaye said,<br />\nnow rests with ARA, which is<br />\nresponsible for running the<br />\nregular dining hall as well.<br />\nThe National Council for<br />\nYoung Israel is providing some<br />\nof the KDH's funding, and<br />\nKaye and the JSA are \"working with the JCC on long-term<br />\nfinancing.\"<br />\nThe University ideally would<br />\nlike the costs of running the<br />\nKDH to be equivalent to those<br />\nof the regular ARA dining hall,<br />\nKaye said. At present, the KDH<br />\nmeal plans are more expensive,<br />\nbecause kosher food is costlier<br />\nthan non-kosher food, because<br />\nARA must pay additional salaries to KDH workers, and because there are far fewer<br />\nstudents eating in the KDH<br />\nthan in the upstairs cafeteria.<br />\nUsually, Kaye said, there are<br />\n\"about sixty\" students subscribing to KDH meal plans, but so<br />\nfar this year there are \"about<br />\nhalf\" that number because<br />\n\"many incoming freshmen<br />\nwere worried\" about KDH's<br />\nfuture.<br />\nHe added that more students<br />\nare signing up now and that<br />\nwhen the KDH moves to its<br />\nnew location, there will be<br />\n<br />\nEngineering<br />\nTo Utilize<br />\nNew System<br />\ncont. from pg. 2<br />\n<br />\nJohn Steers<br />\nThe Kosher Dining Hall. currentl<br />\n<br />\nsituated in the basement of AMR I.<br />\n<br />\nwill soon be moved to the same building's kitchen.<br />\n..\u2022dministration of<br />\nthe KIM has changed hands, and ARA will now handle<br />\nthe dining hall.<br />\n<br />\nroom for \"about one hundred\" for now because the KDH will<br />\nparticipants.<br />\nsoon be moving to a new faciliKaye expressed hope that the ty.

I<br />\nworked side by side with two<br />\nbook designers, who, despite<br />\ntheir own heavy workloads and<br />\ndeadlines (each had several<br />\nmanuscripts in the works), took<br />\nthe time to show me the ropes.<br />\nThe most important project<br />\nI was assigned to was to design<br />\nthe covers and keys for two<br />\nPeterson Field Guide Coloring<br />\nBooks, a new adjunct to the<br />\nstandard Peterson Field<br />\nGuides. It promised to be interesting, and I was eager to<br />\nbegin as they were to have it<br />\nfinished. But first the manuscripts had to pass through the<br />\nhands of the Editorial staff, the<br />\nphotographers, the typesetter,<br />\nand others. And so I had to<br />\nwait my turn.

The Editorial staff was<br />\nswamped with work, and so I<br />\nwas put to work checking copyrights, a confusing process as<br />\n<br />\ntion, but I did participate in the<br />\niifferent stages of several<br />\nbooks. My first project was to<br />\ndesign the page layout for a<br />\ntrade book. This involved<br />\nchoosing the print style, calculating print size and height,<br />\nand calculating the number of<br />\nwords per line and lines per<br />\npage. Each of these elements is<br />\nparticular to a type of book as<br />\nthey are important factors in<br />\nthe overall appearance and<br />\nmood of a book.

Everyone walked quickly toward the bar<br />\nto get a drink before dinner, which was being served<br />\ndownstairs.<br />\nI sat down at an empty table with Andrew McCasker, advising co-chairman and one of three engineering students invited on the weekend. Associate Dean<br />\nfor Administration Norman Krueger joined us, as did<br />\nWalters. I don't recall who else sat at the table.<br />\nWe talked about Orientation and how the parents'<br />\nprogram will be remembered. And by the time everyone had finished their tossed salad, Krueger and I were<br />\ntalking about the lack of tennis courts on campus.<br />\nThere used to be some where Garland Hall is now. As<br />\nfor building indoor courts near the ROTC building,<br />\nthat possibility no longer exists.<br />\nWith prime rib, baked potato and peas, came talk<br />\nabout the Kosher Dining Hall. A new program ha<br />\nbeen implemented. ARA is now paying students to<br />\ncheck which persons belong in the KDH.<br />\nAnd over dessert we talked about the Blue Key<br />\nSociety and the admissions process. Krueger said that<br />\nin a few months, student tour guides may be given<br />\ncommunications credibility. And we all agreed that it's<br />\nextremely difficult to determine which applicants will<br />\nget involved in campus activities. Our discussion,<br />\nhowever, didn't mention the academic aspect of admissions.<br />\nPresident Muller stood up in front of the room and<br />\nintroduced himself. He then asked everyone else to do<br />\nthe same. For administrators and faculty, it was simply<br />\nname, occupation and birthplace. And for students,<br />\nit was name, class, major, campus activity and hometown. Once those were done, Muller gave his opening<br />\nremarks.<br />\nHe talked about how the goal of the weekend was<br />\nnot to solve problems facing the University but to improve relations among administrators, faculty and<br />\nstudents.<br />\nBut, perhaps his most provocative statement was:<br />\n\"The students don't think their education is as good<br />\nas it is, and the faculty thinks it's better.\"<br />\nAfter the address was over, everyone dispersed, and<br />\nas President Muller was leaving, he asked Jakie Hall,<br />\n\"You think it's going to work?\" Hall is senior assistant to the President. I didn't hear Hall's reply<br />\nIt was a little past nine and most people didn't know<br />\nwhat to do. The s ool was closed. The tennis C014145<br />\n<br />\nothers arranged their own transportation. Administrators and faculty members drove in a mixed bunch.<br />\nAnd J.C. Walker, Professor of Physics, flew his 1947,<br />\ntwo-seater plane.<br />\nI got a ride with past Student Council President<br />\nDouglas Fel!man. As we were driving over the Annapolis Bay Bridge, we waved to the van, which Student Council President Maureen Freed was driving.<br />\nAnd we also passed Ross Jones, Vice-President and<br />\nSecretary of the University, and several Other persons,<br />\nwhom we recognized but didn't know by name.<br />\nWe arrived a little past five. Our lateness surely<br />\nwasn't caused by Fellman's Escort radar detector. It<br />\nactually helped a few times and notified us whenever<br />\nwe would pass the microwave ovens of the fast-food<br />\nrestaurants. We were late because I was late. Fel!man<br />\nwas supposed to pick me up in front of the MSE<br />\nlibrary at three. We didn't leave until a quarter after.<br />\n\u2022 Signing in was the first thing we did. We each got<br />\na folder, containing a schedule, lists of participants,<br />\na pad of paper, and two pencils. And beside the folders<br />\nwere name tags which everyone immediately put on<br />\nso they knew with whom they were beginning a conversation. Of course, they had two options. They could<br />\ntalk as if they knew each all along, without introducing themselves. This mainly happened among students,<br />\nwho would then later look on the list to see why a particular student was there.<br />\nOr a formal introduction would take place, in which<br />\ncase, the name tages were used to check spelling. Each<br />\nwould then tell the other what he did within the University. This mainly happened when administrators<br />\nand faculty members first met students. As for administrators or faculty members meeting administrators or faculty members, I'm not sure what happened.<br />\nI took my luggage up to my room. My roommate,<br />\nGregg Weinstock, was washing up in the bathroom.<br />\nGregg, a sophomore, is Student Council Secretary. I<br />\nthrew my suitcase on the chair next to my bed and left<br />\nit there until Sunday.<br />\nIt was approaching five-thirty, and people were still<br />\narriving. A group of students were leaning on a car<br />\nwhich was below my room. We just stood there and<br />\ntalked. And watched as others pulled up their cars.<br />\n\"Who is that?\" someone said.<br />\n\"That's Ron Walters. He teaches history. I once had<br />\nhim for a U.S. survey course.\"<br />\nWalters and two other professors unloaded the car<br />\nand went inside to get their room keys. And when they<br />\ncame back outside, two went off in the other direction to their rooms while Walters walked over to us.<br />\nHis room was two doors down from mine.<br />\nHe was carrying a brown corduroy jacket and an<br />\novernight bag.<br />\n\"I hope you didn't bring a tie.\" There was a rule<br />\nthat no ties were to be worn during the weekend. Strictly casual attire. Shorts. T-shirts. And so on.<br />\n\"Well, I figured I never wear it at school. I might<br />\nas wear it here.\" He never did. In fact, no one wore<br />\na sport jacket on any of the three days.<br />\nWhile Walters was going up the stairs to get to his<br />\nroom, J.C. Walker was opening the lobby door with<br />\none hand and carrying a gas can in the other. It wasn't<br />\nunitl later on that everyone knew what he was doing<br />\nwith a gas can. It took him 45 minutes to fly there.<br />\nMore and more people joined us. Mostly students.<br />\nWe chatted for awhile, looked at our watches, and<br />\nwere getting ready to go inside for the social hour,<br />\nscheduled from six to seven.<br />\nThe bar was upstairs in the conference center. A<br />\ndouble line formed, and as people waited to be<br />\nserved, they either ate stale pretzels or talked with the<br />\nperson next to him in line.<br />\nAfter getting a Seven-and-Seyen, I walked around<br />\nfor awhile, not really sure whom to approach.

At Harvard, graduate students teach Calculus III, and the only person to whom n students can coinlain is the graduate secretary.<br />\n<br />\nShawn Messick, Maureen Freed,<br />\n<br />\nDean of the Whiting School of Engineering David<br />\nVandeLinde then walked over to the bar just as we<br />\nwere talking about the engineering curriculum.<br />\n\"Wh_v can't an engineering degree be offered as a<br />\nvaduate degree?\" Fellman asked.<br />\n\"There are a number offactors involved,\" said<br />\nVandeLinde. \"The engineering school hasn't been accredited yet. Also, a lot of courses, such as Calculus<br />\nand Physics, need to be taught simultaneously with<br />\nthose in the engineering school. Excuse me, hut I have<br />\nto get these drinks back.\"<br />\nBefore the bar closed at eleven, Dean Krueger, Andrew McCasker, and Tracy Caster of the Blue Key Sudety came upstairs. Krueger didn't have his wallet so<br />\nMcCasker bought him a beer.<br />\nFree time was scheduledfor Saturday afternoon so<br />\nwe made plansfor tennis and volle_vball. And we all<br />\nwent back to our rooms and set our alarmsfor between<br />\nseven and sevv-thirty. A general discussion of undergraduate curriculum was scheduled for eight-thirty.<br />\nPresident Muller stood at the front of the seminar<br />\nroom.<br />\n\"We will start now. It is time. Attendance will be<br />\ntaken, he said with a German accent, but shifted quickly into moderating the discussion.<br />\n\"I'd prefer not to have a monologue... What we<br />\ncan talk about is broad versus spcialized education ...There are three types of students at Hopkins.<br />\nThere's the senior who knows as much as a secondyear graduate student at another college, there's the<br />\nilliterate who leaves as an illiterate, and finally, there's<br />\nthe literate who may leave as an illiterate. .It's unlikely that change will come fast at Hopkins.\"<br />\nJ.C. Walker suggested that distribution requirements be. increased, that people are taking courses<br />\nwhich are too narrow. \"As it is now, specialization<br />\nis so special, that the best way is to bring in specialists<br />\nwho just want to spew out their information.\"<br />\nRon Walter's concern was that Advanced Placement<br />\ncredits make people think they're more educated than<br />\nthey actually are. \"What they are doing is taking education away from the University.\"<br />\nHow about a five-year college?<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and Sciences John Gryder<br />\nresponded, \"The University used to be open Saturdays. And students were able to take additional labs.<br />\nNow, its quite remarkable that as the size of the student body has increased, the number of enrollments<br />\nin classes has gone down. Everyone is working less.\"<br />\nMuller then askedwittt\u2022ksvidents come to college<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/11<br />\n<br />\nSt. Michael's<br />\nwithout the vaguest idea of what they want to do.<br />\n\"Why don't they work for awhile?

They're not<br />\nlocked into it.\"<br />\n\"Because parents pressure their kids, they can't say<br />\nthey want to work for awhile,\" said Tracy Maginity,<br />\nClass of 1984 representative to the Student Council.<br />\n\"How much of a turnoff is it for faculty to teach<br />\nstudents not totally interesed in the area?\" asked<br />\nMuller.<br />\n\"Undecideds are fun to teach. You can see them<br />\nhaving fun learning,\" said Dean Fisher. \"But we do<br />\n.y little for the uncommitted.\"<br />\n<br />\n, and Dean George Fisher<br />\n\"<br />\n.1106<br />\n<br />\nSteve Eisenberg<br />\n<br />\nAccessibility of professors was cited as a problem.<br />\nMatt Crenson, chairman of the Political Science<br />\nDepartment said, \"Many political science majors are<br />\nundecided. Undergraduates take courses to find out<br />\nabout political science. But once they get past a certain point, they lose interest, which is partly due to<br />\naccessibility of faculty.\"<br />\n\"If we go towards undergraduates too much, then<br />\nfaculty get mad,\" said Muller. \"And if we go the other<br />\nway, then you hear it from students.\"<br />\n\"The purpose of an undergraduate education is not<br />\nto impart knowledge, but is to make students think,\"<br />\nsaid Dean VandeLinde. \"And if we do a good job,<br />\nthen it doesn't make a difference what the major is.\"<br />\nDoug Fellman responded, \"The greatest thing for<br />\nme is the exposure to high scholarship. How professors<br />\nthink, how they publish papers, what it means to cancel class, and, most important, what it's like to be so'<br />\nsuccessful.\"<br />\n\"Maybe the problem at Hopkins is because of the<br />\nadmissions process,\" said Wendy Golden, Class of<br />\n1983 representative of the Student Council. \"What you<br />\nhave is a nervous guy in a tie sitting around with his<br />\nfamily in the admissions office. We're worried about<br />\npre-professionalism too soon.\"<br />\n\"What we have to do is convince people to take a<br />\nbroader program to get into medical school,\" said<br />\nGryder. \"People think there is a rigid program, and<br />\nas for MCAT's, GRE's and SAT's, they have nothing<br />\nto do with education.\"<br />\nBut should the admissions process still be changed?<br />\n\"We have the shortest admissions form on record,\"<br />\nsaid Warren Moos.\"We don't find out if the person<br />\nis interesting. All we ask for is grades.\"<br />\n\"I have no particular grief for the application,\"<br />\nreplied Muller. 'Filling out an application is a family<br />\nindustry. I had two students in my class who couldn't<br />\nwrite. As president, I looked at their applications. I<br />\napproached one of the students, whose essay was wellwritten, and asked her if she wrote it. 'Oh my mother<br />\nwrote that,' she said.<br />\n\"People have chosen us so we have to serve them<br />\nthe best we know how. Now, we have the obligation<br />\nto address what is right and what is wrong. We're not<br />\nhere to reach conclusions. This time is for reassessing<br />\nthe undergraduate environment. When I first got here,<br />\nthe athletic center continued to give jockstraps to<br />\nwomen. So I ,told the athletic director not to do it<br />\nanymore. He said, 'Yes,' very calmly.

I work very hard on my<br />\ntan.\"<br />\nAfter the break for coffee, everyone met in small<br />\ngroup disussions of either engineering, humanities,<br />\nphysical and natural sciences, or the social sciences.<br />\nThe meetings were held outdoors along the Chesapeake Bay. And small black flies were everywhere.<br />\nI participated in the humanities discussion, but<br />\nMuller had said talk should not be restricted to the area<br />\nunder discussion.<br />\nThere are fewer majors in the humanities than in<br />\nany of the other areas.

Most agreed and the consensus was that the<br />\ncurriculum should be more diverse, as it was in the<br />\npast, and still is at Columbia University, where a core<br />\ncurriculum is required.<br />\n\"Why isn't a Western Civilization course offered<br />\nat Hopkins?\" asked Muller, who was sitting in on each<br />\ndiscussion group. Ideas were thrown hack and forth,<br />\nand the only conclusion was that students would become less interested in the course.<br />\nAmong undergraduates, writing was termed the biggest problem. Students no longer know how to organize their thoughts in a coherent manner. Consequently, several business firms, which hire Hopkins' graduates, are unpleasantly surprised.<br />\nAnother problem discussed is the unawareness of<br />\nundergraduates to what the humanities are. While<br />\nstudents know which courses are available, the majority don't know that most college classes don't require<br />\nmemorization, something that became second-nature<br />\nin high school.<br />\nMuller came by again, and during The sessions, he<br />\nhad noticed one thinehumanities classes are smaller.<br />\nIt was time for lunch.

Another reason May have<br />\nbeen President Muller, who was watching .from the<br />\npool area.<br />\nOn the adjacent court was Doug Fe//man and Gordon Wolman. They had never met before, and Fellman<br />\nmay wish Wolman never came on the weekend. He<br />\nwas an All-America lacrosse player when he was a<br />\nHopkins undergraduate. Afterwards, they spoke for<br />\nan hour over a few glasses of water.<br />\nAtfive everyone was off the tennis courts and out<br />\nof the pool.

The index<br />\nis a virtual who's who of contemporary<br />\npersonalities:<br />\nGeorge Will, Henry Kissinger,<br />\nPhil Donahue, Hugh Kenner<br />\n(that's right, he's our own\u2014<br />\nand mentioned four times),<br />\nTruman Capote, Clare Booth<br />\nLuce, Ralph Nader, David<br />\nNiven, Gore Vidal, and \"...my<br />\nvery old friend\" Ronald Reagan.<br />\nBuckley describes his relation-<br />\n<br />\nship with each, or else recalls an<br />\nanecdote or a sitnilar tidbit. For<br />\nexample, in 1978, Buckley(pro)<br />\nand Reagan (con) participated<br />\nin a highly publicized debate on<br />\nthe Panama Canal Treaties.<br />\n\"Six months after the debate, getting ready in Pasadena<br />\nto set out with Pat (his wife) to<br />\ndinner with the Reagans at the<br />\nPacific Palisades, I was told<br />\nover the phone by my host that.<br />\nI was to tell the driver to proceed very slowly up the drive.<br />\n\"'Why?'<br />\n\"'Never mind why, just do<br />\nas I say,' he (Reagan) teased.<br />\n\"'So I did; and as we mounted his driveway, the headlights<br />\nshone on three successive cardboard signs, each four feet<br />\nsquare, on the first of which<br />\nhad been etched in huge red<br />\ncrayon:<br />\n\"WE BUILT IT!\" then,<br />\n\"WE PAID FOR IT!\" and,<br />\nfinally, tacked to the front<br />\ndoor,<br />\n\"AND IT'S OURS!\"<br />\nKurt Vonnegut has called<br />\nBuckley \"a man who has won<br />\nthe decathlon of human existence,\" and indeed the conservative Buckley enjoys a certain<br />\nstatus that includes phone calls<br />\nfrom the White House and<br />\nlunches with the Vice President.<br />\nBut there's another, non-<br />\n<br />\nJan Lukas<br />\n<br />\npolitical side to Buckley. It<br />\nincludes ocean sailing and<br />\npainting and music. Of course,<br />\nthe predominant activity in his<br />\nlife is writing: three columns a<br />\nweek, books (this is his twentieth), assorted articles<br />\nand...always...correspondence.<br />\nWe learn that Buckley receives<br />\nmany letters each week; this<br />\nfact comes as no surprise. What<br />\nis a surprise is a) the care he<br />\ntakes in reading them, b) the<br />\nfact that he answers all of them,<br />\nand c) that he has time to do<br />\nboth (a) and (b). Some of the<br />\nmost interesting and intimate<br />\npassages of this book are letters<br />\nand responses: some tart, some<br />\nsubtle, some funny, and all<br />\neloquent.<br />\nNaturally, some persons will<br />\ncomplain that Buckley, in<br />\nrecording his life in such a journal, is committing an act of<br />\ngreat egotism and conceit. Yet<br />\n<br />\nthe autobiography is a common<br />\nand accepted form of<br />\nbiography, and Buckley simply<br />\nchooses to record his life in the<br />\npresent and as an excerpt. He<br />\nhad done the same thing for a<br />\nweek in December 1970, and<br />\nthe result was a book entitled<br />\nCruising Speed. That endeavor,<br />\nwrites Buckley, \"had in my<br />\njudgment succeeded in exploring an unusual device for<br />\nautobiographical revelation\u2014<br />\neasier to execute and, in some<br />\nways, potentially more revealing than the more comprehensive conventional treatments.\"<br />\nBuckley's style is elegant and<br />\nsophisticated. The book is full<br />\nof classy Latin phrases that<br />\nnobody understands but which<br />\nserve as reminders of the<br />\nauthor's erudition. The text<br />\nmakes for fast reading and is by<br />\nno means a political treatise or<br />\nattempt to persuade or reform.<br />\n<br />\nin any way the casual reader.<br />\nOne does not have to be a<br />\nBuckley groupie to enjoy Overdrive. Even if the politics<br />\nand the lifestyle offend,<br />\nBuckley is nonetheless an interesting and influential individual. Furthermore, he is<br />\nsuch a talented writer that onel<br />\ncan read the book merely to appreciate and perhaps absorb the<br />\nrich vocabulary and amazing<br />\nsentence patterns.<br />\nOverdrive offers a personal<br />\naccount of his success in a<br />\nunique and exciting combination that truly captures the<br />\nreader. Perhaps, there is a little<br />\nfluff, an extra mention of the<br />\nPresident here, a piece of<br />\nsuperfluous information there.<br />\nBut such is, perhaps, the real<br />\nBuckley.<br />\n<br />\nDoug Fellman<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nArts<br />\nNo, Not Tonight Dear...<br />\nby Gigi Mark<br />\nI DO!

You just whacked your<br />\nfirst serve and stood there as<br />\nConnor's returns flew right by<br />\nyou.

The University<br />\ngenerally did not have sufficient<br />\nfunds to help both its own<br />\nundergraduates and transfers,<br />\nso the transfers weren't given<br />\nfinancial aid. They were seen as<br />\na group who \"had the option of<br />\nreturning to their former institiutions,\" Broadbent said.<br />\nRecently, however, this has<br />\nchanged. Beginning this year,<br />\nthe administration decided to<br />\nallow transfers to be considered<br />\nfor financial aid, Broadbent<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAlthough transfers are not<br />\neligible for merit-based aid,<br />\nthey are considered in the same<br />\npool as other students when aid<br />\nis allotted, according to<br />\nAssociated Dean of Administration C. Norman<br />\nKrueger.<br />\nGenerally, a first-year<br />\ntransfer student won't receive a<br />\nfinancial aid package that is<br />\ncomparable to that of incoming<br />\nfreshmen or returning upperclassmen, Broadbent said.<br />\nThe self-help portion is usually<br />\nlarger for transfer students, she<br /><br />\nadded. All transfers are expected to take out a $2,500<br />\nGuaranteed Student Loan,<br />\nsomething which is not required<br />\nof other students. However, in<br />\nthe second and subsequent<br />\nyears, according to Broadbent,<br />\nfinancial aid packages for<br />\ntransfers are comparable to<br />\nthose of other students.<br />\nHopkins is also admitting<br />\nmore transfers. This year,<br />\nHopkins has approximately 50<br />\ntransfers, 25 percent more than<br />\nlast year, according to Jerome<br />\nSchnydman, Director of<br />\nUndergraduate Admissions.<br />\n\"There is room in a number<br />\nof classes,\" Schnydman said.<br />\n\"Although the attrition rate at<br />\nHopkins is very low, there<br />\nnevertheless are a few students<br />\nwho withdraw, and these spaces<br />\nmust be filled.\"<br />\nUpperclass courses tend not<br />\nto be filled, Schnydman said.<br />\nTherefore, by accepting<br />\ntransfer students, who enter the<br />\nUniversity directly at the upperclass level, the University is<br />\nmaking better use of its faculty<br />\nand resources.<br />\nWhen research was conducted to find out how transfer<br />\nstudents performed here<br />\nacademically, it was found that<br />\nmost were very successful,<br />\nSchnydman said. Some<br />\nstudents transferred because<br />\nthey experienced difficulties at,<br />\nor were dissatisfied with, their<br />\nformer schools. Primarily,<br /><br />\nIll<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\nhowever, students applied to<br />\ntransfer to Hopkins because<br />\nthey found that they were attracted by its academic quality,<br />\nits small size, its researchoriented curriculum, or its<br />\noverall atmosphere, noted<br />\nSchnydman.<br /><br />\n.Ak<br /><br />\n_<br />\n..,,<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n.<br />\n'<br />\n7<br /><br />\nTransfer students, for the<br />\nmost part, have characteristics<br />\nthat are similar to those of<br />\nstuents who apply directly out<br />\nof high school. Students who<br />\nwant to transfer are carefully<br />\nscreened: Those who wish to<br />\napply for transfer admission<br />\nmust first submit a preliminary<br />\napplication, which is free. If approved, the student is sent a<br />\nmore detailed application, for<br />\nwhich there is a fee.<br />\nWhen receiving a transfer application, the admissions office<br />\nlooks for a student who has<br />\nspent at least two years at an accredited college and has taken<br />\ncourses similar in content,<br />\nscope, and difficulty to those<br />\noffered at Hopkins, Schnydman said. The student must<br />\nhave received grades of C or<br />\nbetter in these courses and must<br />\nhave maintained an overall<br />\nGPA of at least 3.0 to be admitted. The SAT or ACT is also required. The student's academic<br />\nrecord at his or her previous<br />\ncollege is perhaps the most important set of credentials that<br />\nthe admissions staff considers<br />\nwhen making a decision on a<br />\nfransfer, according to Schnydman.<br /><br />\n\u2022'<br /><br />\n\u2014 --<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n4.'.<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\n.<br />\nJohn Steers<br /><br />\nBaltimore citizens went to polling booths like these in the Homewood<br />\nFriends Meeting Hall Tuesda to vote in the cil-wide Democratic<br />\nprimar).

Leys is concerned that med schools have<br />\nbecome so swamped with applications that it isn't possible for<br />\nthem to pay close enough attention to each applicant.<br />\nThe result, she said, is the<br />\noveruse of quantitative measures such as the MCAT at the<br /><br />\nexpense of more humanistic<br />\nmeasures such as essays, recommendations, and interviews. At<br />\nthe very worst, she said, she<br />\nfears that \"some medical<br />\nschools rely solely on a standardized test\" in evaluating applicants.<br />\nStudents often respond to<br />\nthis .situation by placing too<br />\nmuch emphasis on the MCAT,<br />\nLeys said. \"My philosophy is<br />\nthat students should be realistic<br />\nin preparing for the MCAT,<br />\nbut it shouldn't be given excessive weight,\" she said.<br />\nShe expressed worry that<br />\nsome pre-meds spend so much<br />\ntime preparing for the MCAT<br />\nthat they forego taking courses<br />\nthey may enjoy only because<br /><br />\nthey wouldn't improve their<br />\nMCAT scores. Also, between<br />\n60 to 70 percent of pre-meds<br />\nnationwide spent over $300<br />\neach last year for classes which<br />\nsupposedly would increase their<br />\nchances of doing well on the<br />\ntest.<br />\nGiven these problems, Leys<br />\nasked, what is the predictive<br />\nvalue of the MCAT? While<br />\nnoting that a direct relationship<br />\nbetween MCAT scores and performance in the basic medical<br />\nschool science courses has been<br />\nestablished, she pointed out<br />\nthat \"the MCAT does not test<br />\na sthdent's ability to deal with<br />\nthe gray areas that arise in a<br />\nphysician's work.\"<br /><br />\nLeys said she fears that some compare a student with a 4.0<br />\nmed schools may not be sen- GPA from a small school<br />\nto a<br />\nsitive enough to those charac- student with a 3.5 from<br />\nHopteristics which, on the surface, kins?\"<br />\ndon't relate to being a good<br />\nWhen asked if anything can<br />\ndoctor.

Circulation 60(X).<br /><br />\nA Weekend With George<br />\nNo one knew if the retreat at the Harbourtowne Inn was going to be successful. Friday night, after President Steven Muller gave<br />\nhe<br />\nremarks,<br />\nopening<br />\nhis<br />\nHall,<br />\n\"You<br />\nasked his senior assistant Jakie<br />\nthink it's going to work?\"<br />\nThe retreat did work. It was a success.<br />\nFor the first time since Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower was University President, administrators, faculty members, and students<br />\ntalked as a group, as people, and not in a<br />\nhierarchical sense.<br />\nThey sat around conference tables, picnic<br />\ntables and dining tables, talking about what<br />\nthey did during the summer. Why the admissions process needs to be changed. Their<br />\nfamilies, as well as their leisure time activities. And whether or not the curriculum<br />\nwill ever be restructured.<br />\nIdeas were thrown back and forth. And<br />\nbecause of the discussion topics' complexity, people soon became exhausted and needed time to rest. That's why free time was<br />\nscheduled.<br />\nBut there was an even more important<br />\npurpose for that. Students and non-students<br />\nsat around the pool, played tennis, or went<br />\nshopping. It wasn't essential that they talk<br /><br />\nabout school as long as they got to know<br />\neach other better; that's what was important.<br />\nUntil people in the Hopkins community<br />\ncommunicate with one another, problems<br />\nfacing the University won't be solved.<br />\nStudents began calling several administrators and faculty members by their<br />\nfirst names. For instance, when students asked Dean of Arts and Sciences George what<br />\nthey should call him, he said \"George.<br />\nThat's my name, isn't it?\"<br />\nSome think the wrong people were invited<br />\non the weekend. That may or may not be<br />\ntrue. Because it was the first retreat and<br />\nbecause no one knew if it was going to work,<br />\nit was essential that those invited were willing .to participate. They did.<br />\nPerhaps, if there is a retreat next year,<br />\nother people, with either more diverse<br />\nbackgrounds or with fewer commitments to<br />\nHopkins, will be invited.<br />\nBut for now, those who participated in last<br />\nweekend's activities can now approach an<br />\nadministrator, a faculty member, or a student and say,\"Do you have a minute to talk<br />\nabout what we discussed at Harbourtowne?\"<br />\nThe only question is, will they?<br /><br />\nLetters,<br />\nSophomores Co Wild<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI find your cartoon<br />\n\"Detritus\" of September<br />\n9, 1983 to be offensive to Christians in general and Catholics in<br />\nparticular.<br />\nYou ridicule religion and<br />\nthose professing it as a matter<br />\nof policy.

The game is<br />\ncalled aerial electronic sui-veillance, and it isn't for amateurs.<br />\nFrom Eielson Air Force Base<br />\nnear Fairbanks, Alaska, and<br />\nShemya Air Force Base at the<br />\nWestern tip of the Aleutian<br />\nIslands, Air Force and Navy<br />\naircraft routinely set out on<br />\nreconnaissance missions near or<br />\nover the Soviet Union's Eastern<br />\nedge. Data collected on these<br />\nflights (called ELINT for electronic intelligence) accumulate<br />\nin supercomputers managed by<br />\nthe National Security Agency<br />\n(NSA) at Fort Meade, Md.,<br />\namong other locations. In his<br />\nSept. 5 address to the nation,<br />\nPresident Reagan admitted that<br />\na reconnaissance plane had<br />\ntrailed KAL 007, but that it had<br />\nreturned to Alaska prior to the<br />\nSoviet attack.<br />\nMeanwile, U.S. military aircraft also traverse Soviet airspace, just as the Russians do<br />\nours, to test the range and frequency of radar on the ground.<br />\nAlthough satellites and radar<br />\ninstallations in Japan and other<br />\ncountries are undertaking an increased surveillance burden, the<br />\nU.S. is soon expected to make<br />\nadditions to its electronic<br />\nsquadrons. For example, ESystems, of Dallas, Texas, is<br />\ndeveloping a pilotless drone<br />\nthat will be 'able to accomplish<br />\nany number of tasks before its<br />\nlikely destruction by antiaircraft missiles. Israel demonstrated the drone's capabilities<br />\nduring its confrontation with<br />\nSyria in Lebanon last year.<br />\nAmerica's investment in electronic surveillance technology,<br />\nfor which the Reagan administration is seeking $4.7 billion in<br />\n1984, may seem worth every<br />\npenny after last week's air atrocity. Yet, it might be heading<br />\nthe U.S. and the Soviets toward<br />\nmore deadly, unnecessary incidents in the future. Xs James<br />\nBamford, author of the Puzzle Palace, a book about.the<br />\nNSA, said last week, \"The<br />\ntruth is that at any moment this<br />\nwhole game of electronic sur-<br /><br />\nveillance can blow up.

Over<br />\nthe past four years, U.S aid to<br />\nEl Salvador, including loans,<br />\nhas totaled only $1.3 billion.<br />\nThe $110 million the Administration requested for military<br />\nassistance in the current fiscal<br />\nyear would service our national<br />\ndebt for only 11 hours. Congress has agreed to $81.3<br />\nmillion.<br />\nWickwire implied that U.S.<br />\naid was strengthening the rightist elements in Salvadoran society. Yet, starting with the<br />\nCarter administration, U.S.<br />\npolicy has consciously sought to<br />\nbreak the power of the oligarchy and remove the sources of<br />\npopular grievances. For this<br />\nreason, the U.S. pressed for<br />\nelections and land reform, both<br />\nof which the right opposed.<br />\nU.S. pressure resulted in<br />\nMagana, a highly respected<br />\nmoderate, becoming president<br />\nof the Constitutional Assembly<br />\ninstead of the fascist D'Aubuisson. And while the number of<br />\ncivilians killed is still high, the<br />\nnumber of deaths last year was<br />\nreduced by half, thanks to Administration policy that has<br />\nstressed the link between aid<br />\nand human rights.<br />\nProgress against the insurgents has been slow but<br />\nsteady. Under U.S. tutelage,<br />\nthe Salvadoran Army's morale<br />\nhas improved and they are now<br />\nbeginning to adopt aggressive<br />\nanti-guerilla tactics. The<br />\ngovernment has coordinated its<br />\nmilitary presence with programs in health, education,<br />\nagriculture, and transportation<br />\nto retain the area's loyalty, and<br />\nthey are beginning to work.<br />\nRueben Zamoro, the political<br />\nleader of the leftist guerillas,<br />\nhas acknowledged that if U.S.<br />\naid continues, the rebels can no<br />\nlonger hope to win.<br />\nThe Wickwires of this world<br />\nunfortunately have little patience for this type of strategy.<br />\nBecause the U.S. refuses, both<br />\nmorally and pragmatically, to<br />\nsupport the radical quick-fix,<br /><br />\nThe Sunday Experience officially began September 11<br />\nwith a presentation by Chester<br />\nWickwire on his impressions of<br />\nNicaragua and El Salvador. I<br />\nhad gone hoping to hear a<br />\nbalanced, and at least semiobjective account of the political and military situation in<br />\nboth Of these troubled nations.<br />\nInstead, I was subjected to a<br />\nbiased and distorted description<br />\nthat seriously puts to question<br />\nWickwire's intellectual honesty<br />\nand his true commitment to the<br />\nliberal ideals he espouses.<br />\nWickwire's views are, sadly<br />\nenough, held by many in the<br />\nU.S. Like most liberals, he<br />\nbelieves that the U.S. in El<br />\nSalvador is supporting a repressive regime at war with its own<br />\npeople, and that Washington is<br />\npursuing a purely military approach to political and economic problems. He believes we<br />\nshould end all military aid and<br />\nsend El Salvador our regrets<br />\nbecause the struggle between<br />\nthe \"fascist\" right and the<br />\n\"progressive\" left is internal<br />\nand not a question of East vs.<br />\nWest.<br />\nAs for Nicaragua, Wickwire<br />\nbelieves that the Sandinistas are<br />\ntrue social reformers dedicated<br />\nto helping the poor and the oppressed. Their increasing reliance on Cuba and the U.S.S.R.<br />\nis not the fault of MarxistLeninists but U.S. aggression.<br />\nFurthermore, the Sandinistas<br />\ndo not seek to export revolution<br />\nnor to destabilize their neighbors. This is a myth perpetrated<br />\nby the Reagan Administration<br />\nin order to justify its military<br />\naid to the \"contras\", mostly<br />\nSamocistas, whom it would like<br />\nto see regain power.<br />\nUnfortunately, Wickwire's<br />\nhalf-baked assumptions are<br />\ncompletely at odds with the<br />\nfacts. Consider El Salvador.<br />\nFirst, three out of every four<br />\ndollars we give to El Salvador<br />\nis economic aid, especially for<br />\nprograms such as land reform<br />\nand education.

The National Council for Young Israel<br />\nhas not ceased to provide funding, but, Kaye said, as of<br />\nAugust the administration of<br />\nthe KDH was \"dropped in the<br />\nlap of the Jewish Community<br />\nCenter.\" This situation constituted what Kaye called the<br />\n\"small crisis.\" It was resolved,<br /><br />\nhe said, through the diligent<br />\n\"work and attention\" of the<br />\nJCC, University administrators<br />\nsuch as Bettye Miller of the Office of the Auxiliary Enterprises, and John Hattersley of<br />\nARA.<br />\nThe responsibility of administering the KDH.

At present, the KDH<br />\nmeal plans are more expensive,<br />\nbecause kosher food is costlier<br />\nthan non-kosher food, because<br />\nARA must pay additional salaries to KDH workers, and because there are far fewer<br />\nstudents eating in the KDH<br />\nthan in the upstairs cafeteria.<br />\nUsually, Kaye said, there are<br />\n\"about sixty\" students subscribing to KDH meal plans, but so<br />\nfar this year there are \"about<br />\nhalf\" that number because<br />\n\"many incoming freshmen<br />\nwere worried\" about KDH's<br />\nfuture.<br />\nHe added that more students<br />\nare signing up now and that<br />\nwhen the KDH moves to its<br />\nnew location, there will be<br /><br />\nEngineering<br />\nTo Utilize<br />\nNew System<br />\ncont. from pg. 2<br /><br />\nJohn Steers<br />\nThe Kosher Dining Hall. currentl<br /><br />\nsituated in the basement of AMR I.<br /><br />\nwill soon be moved to the same building's kitchen.<br />\n..\u2022dministration of<br />\nthe KIM has changed hands, and ARA will now handle<br />\nthe dining hall.<br /><br />\nroom for \"about one hundred\" for now because the KDH will<br />\nparticipants.<br />\nsoon be moving to a new faciliKaye expressed hope that the ty.

Mine was a non-paying position, but many internships do pay, though usually<br />\npoorly. Most of my work was<br />\nfor the design department,<br />\nwhich handles the visual aspect<br />\nof production\u2014the appearance<br />\nof the book, including the<br />\njacket and interior layout. I<br />\nworked side by side with two<br />\nbook designers, who, despite<br />\ntheir own heavy workloads and<br />\ndeadlines (each had several<br />\nmanuscripts in the works), took<br />\nthe time to show me the ropes.<br />\nThe most important project<br />\nI was assigned to was to design<br />\nthe covers and keys for two<br />\nPeterson Field Guide Coloring<br />\nBooks, a new adjunct to the<br />\nstandard Peterson Field<br />\nGuides. It promised to be interesting, and I was eager to<br />\nbegin as they were to have it<br />\nfinished. But first the manuscripts had to pass through the<br />\nhands of the Editorial staff, the<br />\nphotographers, the typesetter,<br />\nand others. And so I had to<br />\nwait my turn. This phenomena<br />\nis, as I soon learned, typical.<br />\nSince so many people are involved in the publication of a<br />\nsingle book and since each of<br />\nthese people usually has several<br />\nprojects of his own, one gets<br />\nused to waiting and to busying<br />\noneself with many other books<br />\nin the production line.<br /><br />\nDuring this time, I became<br />\nacquainted with several other<br />\naspects of trade book production. The Editorial staff was<br />\nswamped with work, and so I<br />\nwas put to work checking copyrights, a confusing process as<br /><br />\ntion, but I did participate in the<br />\niifferent stages of several<br />\nbooks. My first project was to<br />\ndesign the page layout for a<br />\ntrade book. This involved<br />\nchoosing the print style, calculating print size and height,<br />\nand calculating the number of<br />\nwords per line and lines per<br />\npage. Each of these elements is<br />\nparticular to a type of book as<br />\nthey are important factors in<br />\nthe overall appearance and<br />\nmood of a book.

We talked about his summer in<br />\nOregon and the type of food that's available in California, where he went to graduate school at Berkeley. He<br />\neven gave me the name of an Indian restaurant in Baltimore.<br />\nLast call. Everyone walked quickly toward the bar<br />\nto get a drink before dinner, which was being served<br />\ndownstairs.<br />\nI sat down at an empty table with Andrew McCasker, advising co-chairman and one of three engineering students invited on the weekend. Associate Dean<br />\nfor Administration Norman Krueger joined us, as did<br />\nWalters. I don't recall who else sat at the table.<br />\nWe talked about Orientation and how the parents'<br />\nprogram will be remembered. And by the time everyone had finished their tossed salad, Krueger and I were<br />\ntalking about the lack of tennis courts on campus.<br />\nThere used to be some where Garland Hall is now. As<br />\nfor building indoor courts near the ROTC building,<br />\nthat possibility no longer exists.<br />\nWith prime rib, baked potato and peas, came talk<br />\nabout the Kosher Dining Hall. A new program ha<br />\nbeen implemented. ARA is now paying students to<br />\ncheck which persons belong in the KDH.<br />\nAnd over dessert we talked about the Blue Key<br />\nSociety and the admissions process. Krueger said that<br />\nin a few months, student tour guides may be given<br />\ncommunications credibility. And we all agreed that it's<br />\nextremely difficult to determine which applicants will<br />\nget involved in campus activities. Our discussion,<br />\nhowever, didn't mention the academic aspect of admissions.<br />\nPresident Muller stood up in front of the room and<br />\nintroduced himself. He then asked everyone else to do<br />\nthe same. For administrators and faculty, it was simply<br />\nname, occupation and birthplace. And for students,<br />\nit was name, class, major, campus activity and hometown. Once those were done, Muller gave his opening<br />\nremarks.<br />\nHe talked about how the goal of the weekend was<br />\nnot to solve problems facing the University but to improve relations among administrators, faculty and<br />\nstudents.<br />\nBut, perhaps his most provocative statement was:<br />\n\"The students don't think their education is as good<br />\nas it is, and the faculty thinks it's better.\"<br />\nAfter the address was over, everyone dispersed, and<br />\nas President Muller was leaving, he asked Jakie Hall,<br />\n\"You think it's going to work?\" Hall is senior assistant to the President. I didn't hear Hall's reply<br />\nIt was a little past nine and most people didn't know<br />\nwhat to do. The s ool was closed. The tennis C014145<br /><br />\nothers arranged their own transportation. Administrators and faculty members drove in a mixed bunch.<br />\nAnd J.C. Walker, Professor of Physics, flew his 1947,<br />\ntwo-seater plane.<br />\nI got a ride with past Student Council President<br />\nDouglas Fel!man. As we were driving over the Annapolis Bay Bridge, we waved to the van, which Student Council President Maureen Freed was driving.<br />\nAnd we also passed Ross Jones, Vice-President and<br />\nSecretary of the University, and several Other persons,<br />\nwhom we recognized but didn't know by name.<br />\nWe arrived a little past five. Our lateness surely<br />\nwasn't caused by Fellman's Escort radar detector. It<br />\nactually helped a few times and notified us whenever<br />\nwe would pass the microwave ovens of the fast-food<br />\nrestaurants. We were late because I was late. Fel!man<br />\nwas supposed to pick me up in front of the MSE<br />\nlibrary at three. We didn't leave until a quarter after.<br />\n\u2022 Signing in was the first thing we did. We each got<br />\na folder, containing a schedule, lists of participants,<br />\na pad of paper, and two pencils. And beside the folders<br />\nwere name tags which everyone immediately put on<br />\nso they knew with whom they were beginning a conversation. Of course, they had two options. They could<br />\ntalk as if they knew each all along, without introducing themselves. This mainly happened among students,<br />\nwho would then later look on the list to see why a particular student was there.<br />\nOr a formal introduction would take place, in which<br />\ncase, the name tages were used to check spelling. Each<br />\nwould then tell the other what he did within the University. This mainly happened when administrators<br />\nand faculty members first met students. As for administrators or faculty members meeting administrators or faculty members, I'm not sure what happened.<br />\nI took my luggage up to my room. My roommate,<br />\nGregg Weinstock, was washing up in the bathroom.<br />\nGregg, a sophomore, is Student Council Secretary. I<br />\nthrew my suitcase on the chair next to my bed and left<br />\nit there until Sunday.<br />\nIt was approaching five-thirty, and people were still<br />\narriving. A group of students were leaning on a car<br />\nwhich was below my room. We just stood there and<br />\ntalked. And watched as others pulled up their cars.<br />\n\"Who is that?\" someone said.<br />\n\"That's Ron Walters. He teaches history. I once had<br />\nhim for a U.S. survey course.\"<br />\nWalters and two other professors unloaded the car<br />\nand went inside to get their room keys. And when they<br />\ncame back outside, two went off in the other direction to their rooms while Walters walked over to us.<br />\nHis room was two doors down from mine.<br />\nHe was carrying a brown corduroy jacket and an<br />\novernight bag.<br />\n\"I hope you didn't bring a tie.\" There was a rule<br />\nthat no ties were to be worn during the weekend. Strictly casual attire. Shorts. T-shirts. And so on.<br />\n\"Well, I figured I never wear it at school. I might<br />\nas wear it here.\" He never did. In fact, no one wore<br />\na sport jacket on any of the three days.<br />\nWhile Walters was going up the stairs to get to his<br />\nroom, J.C. Walker was opening the lobby door with<br />\none hand and carrying a gas can in the other. It wasn't<br />\nunitl later on that everyone knew what he was doing<br />\nwith a gas can. It took him 45 minutes to fly there.<br />\nMore and more people joined us. Mostly students.<br />\nWe chatted for awhile, looked at our watches, and<br />\nwere getting ready to go inside for the social hour,<br />\nscheduled from six to seven.<br />\nThe bar was upstairs in the conference center. A<br />\ndouble line formed, and as people waited to be<br />\nserved, they either ate stale pretzels or talked with the<br />\nperson next to him in line.<br />\nAfter getting a Seven-and-Seyen, I walked around<br />\nfor awhile, not really sure whom to approach. All the<br />\nDean VandeLinde giving his closing remarks<br />\nchairs around the tables were taken, and most people didn't have lights.

At Harvard, graduate students teach Calculus III, and the only person to whom n students can coinlain is the graduate secretary.<br /><br />\nShawn Messick, Maureen Freed,<br /><br />\nDean of the Whiting School of Engineering David<br />\nVandeLinde then walked over to the bar just as we<br />\nwere talking about the engineering curriculum.<br />\n\"Wh_v can't an engineering degree be offered as a<br />\nvaduate degree?\" Fellman asked.<br />\n\"There are a number offactors involved,\" said<br />\nVandeLinde. \"The engineering school hasn't been accredited yet. Also, a lot of courses, such as Calculus<br />\nand Physics, need to be taught simultaneously with<br />\nthose in the engineering school. Excuse me, hut I have<br />\nto get these drinks back.\"<br />\nBefore the bar closed at eleven, Dean Krueger, Andrew McCasker, and Tracy Caster of the Blue Key Sudety came upstairs. Krueger didn't have his wallet so<br />\nMcCasker bought him a beer.<br />\nFree time was scheduledfor Saturday afternoon so<br />\nwe made plansfor tennis and volle_vball. And we all<br />\nwent back to our rooms and set our alarmsfor between<br />\nseven and sevv-thirty. A general discussion of undergraduate curriculum was scheduled for eight-thirty.<br />\nPresident Muller stood at the front of the seminar<br />\nroom.<br />\n\"We will start now. It is time. Attendance will be<br />\ntaken, he said with a German accent, but shifted quickly into moderating the discussion.<br />\n\"I'd prefer not to have a monologue... What we<br />\ncan talk about is broad versus spcialized education ...There are three types of students at Hopkins.<br />\nThere's the senior who knows as much as a secondyear graduate student at another college, there's the<br />\nilliterate who leaves as an illiterate, and finally, there's<br />\nthe literate who may leave as an illiterate. .It's unlikely that change will come fast at Hopkins.\"<br />\nJ.C. Walker suggested that distribution requirements be. increased, that people are taking courses<br />\nwhich are too narrow. \"As it is now, specialization<br />\nis so special, that the best way is to bring in specialists<br />\nwho just want to spew out their information.\"<br />\nRon Walter's concern was that Advanced Placement<br />\ncredits make people think they're more educated than<br />\nthey actually are. \"What they are doing is taking education away from the University.\"<br />\nHow about a five-year college?<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and Sciences John Gryder<br />\nresponded, \"The University used to be open Saturdays. And students were able to take additional labs.<br />\nNow, its quite remarkable that as the size of the student body has increased, the number of enrollments<br />\nin classes has gone down. Everyone is working less.\"<br />\nMuller then askedwittt\u2022ksvidents come to college<br />\n4<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br /><br />\nSt. Michael's<br />\nwithout the vaguest idea of what they want to do.<br />\n\"Why don't they work for awhile? People don't necessarily have to go to college right away. They're not<br />\nlocked into it.\"<br />\n\"Because parents pressure their kids, they can't say<br />\nthey want to work for awhile,\" said Tracy Maginity,<br />\nClass of 1984 representative to the Student Council.<br />\n\"How much of a turnoff is it for faculty to teach<br />\nstudents not totally interesed in the area?\" asked<br />\nMuller.<br />\n\"Undecideds are fun to teach. You can see them<br />\nhaving fun learning,\" said Dean Fisher. \"But we do<br />\n.y little for the uncommitted.\"<br /><br />\n, and Dean George Fisher<br />\n\"<br />\n.1106<br /><br />\nSteve Eisenberg<br /><br />\nAccessibility of professors was cited as a problem.<br />\nMatt Crenson, chairman of the Political Science<br />\nDepartment said, \"Many political science majors are<br />\nundecided. Undergraduates take courses to find out<br />\nabout political science. But once they get past a certain point, they lose interest, which is partly due to<br />\naccessibility of faculty.\"<br />\n\"If we go towards undergraduates too much, then<br />\nfaculty get mad,\" said Muller. \"And if we go the other<br />\nway, then you hear it from students.\"<br />\n\"The purpose of an undergraduate education is not<br />\nto impart knowledge, but is to make students think,\"<br />\nsaid Dean VandeLinde. \"And if we do a good job,<br />\nthen it doesn't make a difference what the major is.\"<br />\nDoug Fellman responded, \"The greatest thing for<br />\nme is the exposure to high scholarship. How professors<br />\nthink, how they publish papers, what it means to cancel class, and, most important, what it's like to be so'<br />\nsuccessful.\"<br />\n\"Maybe the problem at Hopkins is because of the<br />\nadmissions process,\" said Wendy Golden, Class of<br />\n1983 representative of the Student Council. \"What you<br />\nhave is a nervous guy in a tie sitting around with his<br />\nfamily in the admissions office. We're worried about<br />\npre-professionalism too soon.\"<br />\n\"What we have to do is convince people to take a<br />\nbroader program to get into medical school,\" said<br />\nGryder. \"People think there is a rigid program, and<br />\nas for MCAT's, GRE's and SAT's, they have nothing<br />\nto do with education.\"<br />\nBut should the admissions process still be changed?<br />\n\"We have the shortest admissions form on record,\"<br />\nsaid Warren Moos.\"We don't find out if the person<br />\nis interesting. All we ask for is grades.\"<br />\n\"I have no particular grief for the application,\"<br />\nreplied Muller. 'Filling out an application is a family<br />\nindustry. I had two students in my class who couldn't<br />\nwrite. As president, I looked at their applications. I<br />\napproached one of the students, whose essay was wellwritten, and asked her if she wrote it. 'Oh my mother<br />\nwrote that,' she said.<br />\n\"People have chosen us so we have to serve them<br />\nthe best we know how. Now, we have the obligation<br />\nto address what is right and what is wrong. We're not<br />\nhere to reach conclusions. This time is for reassessing<br />\nthe undergraduate environment. When I first got here,<br />\nthe athletic center continued to give jockstraps to<br />\nwomen. So I ,told the athletic director not to do it<br />\nanymore. He said, 'Yes,' very calmly. Now we, as a<br />\nschool, talk more.Elppwr used to have a Glass Pa-<br /><br />\nvilion.

We purposely chose<br />\nthis place so you'd have no place to go. As for me.<br />\nI'll be at the pool. I know most of you think I use a<br />\nsun lamp. That's not true. I work very hard on my<br />\ntan.\"<br />\nAfter the break for coffee, everyone met in small<br />\ngroup disussions of either engineering, humanities,<br />\nphysical and natural sciences, or the social sciences.<br />\nThe meetings were held outdoors along the Chesapeake Bay. And small black flies were everywhere.<br />\nI participated in the humanities discussion, but<br />\nMuller had said talk should not be restricted to the area<br />\nunder discussion.<br />\nThere are fewer majors in the humanities than in<br />\nany of the other areas. The Writing Seminars with 50<br />\nhas the largest number.<br />\nGordon Wolman, chairman of the Geography and<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering Department, accused today's, college system of being a steping stone to the job<br />\nmarket. Most agreed and the consensus was that the<br />\ncurriculum should be more diverse, as it was in the<br />\npast, and still is at Columbia University, where a core<br />\ncurriculum is required.<br />\n\"Why isn't a Western Civilization course offered<br />\nat Hopkins?\" asked Muller, who was sitting in on each<br />\ndiscussion group. Ideas were thrown hack and forth,<br />\nand the only conclusion was that students would become less interested in the course.<br />\nAmong undergraduates, writing was termed the biggest problem. Students no longer know how to organize their thoughts in a coherent manner. Consequently, several business firms, which hire Hopkins' graduates, are unpleasantly surprised.<br />\nAnother problem discussed is the unawareness of<br />\nundergraduates to what the humanities are. While<br />\nstudents know which courses are available, the majority don't know that most college classes don't require<br />\nmemorization, something that became second-nature<br />\nin high school.<br />\nMuller came by again, and during The sessions, he<br />\nhad noticed one thinehumanities classes are smaller.<br />\nIt was time for lunch. I spoke with Dean Gryder<br />\nabout science labs, how most are cookbook oriented.<br />\n\"What's important is how scientists work and think,\"<br />\nsaid Gryder.<br />\nA buffet was served. Chicken salad, Tuna salad.<br />\nPotato salad. Cole slaw.

Another reason May have<br />\nbeen President Muller, who was watching .from the<br />\npool area.<br />\nOn the adjacent court was Doug Fe//man and Gordon Wolman. They had never met before, and Fellman<br />\nmay wish Wolman never came on the weekend. He<br />\nwas an All-America lacrosse player when he was a<br />\nHopkins undergraduate. Afterwards, they spoke for<br />\nan hour over a few glasses of water.<br />\nAtfive everyone was off the tennis courts and out<br />\nof the pool.

Buckley, Jr. does in<br />\nhis latest book, Overdrive: A<br />\nPersonal Documentary. Buckley, the columnist, philosopher<br />\npolitico, leads an incredibly rich<br />\nlife and its flavor is captured<br />\nexquisitely in eight chapters<br />\ncorresponding to eight consecutive days in his life. The index<br />\nis a virtual who's who of contemporary<br />\npersonalities:<br />\nGeorge Will, Henry Kissinger,<br />\nPhil Donahue, Hugh Kenner<br />\n(that's right, he's our own\u2014<br />\nand mentioned four times),<br />\nTruman Capote, Clare Booth<br />\nLuce, Ralph Nader, David<br />\nNiven, Gore Vidal, and \"...my<br />\nvery old friend\" Ronald Reagan.<br />\nBuckley describes his relation-<br /><br />\nship with each, or else recalls an<br />\nanecdote or a sitnilar tidbit. For<br />\nexample, in 1978, Buckley(pro)<br />\nand Reagan (con) participated<br />\nin a highly publicized debate on<br />\nthe Panama Canal Treaties.<br />\n\"Six months after the debate, getting ready in Pasadena<br />\nto set out with Pat (his wife) to<br />\ndinner with the Reagans at the<br />\nPacific Palisades, I was told<br />\nover the phone by my host that.<br />\nI was to tell the driver to proceed very slowly up the drive.<br />\n\"'Why?'<br />\n\"'Never mind why, just do<br />\nas I say,' he (Reagan) teased.<br />\n\"'So I did; and as we mounted his driveway, the headlights<br />\nshone on three successive cardboard signs, each four feet<br />\nsquare, on the first of which<br />\nhad been etched in huge red<br />\ncrayon:<br />\n\"WE BUILT IT!\" then,<br />\n\"WE PAID FOR IT!\" and,<br />\nfinally, tacked to the front<br />\ndoor,<br />\n\"AND IT'S OURS!\"<br />\nKurt Vonnegut has called<br />\nBuckley \"a man who has won<br />\nthe decathlon of human existence,\" and indeed the conservative Buckley enjoys a certain<br />\nstatus that includes phone calls<br />\nfrom the White House and<br />\nlunches with the Vice President.<br />\nBut there's another, non-<br /><br />\nJan Lukas<br /><br />\npolitical side to Buckley. It<br />\nincludes ocean sailing and<br />\npainting and music. Of course,<br />\nthe predominant activity in his<br />\nlife is writing: three columns a<br />\nweek, books (this is his twentieth), assorted articles<br />\nand...always...correspondence.<br />\nWe learn that Buckley receives<br />\nmany letters each week; this<br />\nfact comes as no surprise. What<br />\nis a surprise is a) the care he<br />\ntakes in reading them, b) the<br />\nfact that he answers all of them,<br />\nand c) that he has time to do<br />\nboth (a) and (b). Some of the<br />\nmost interesting and intimate<br />\npassages of this book are letters<br />\nand responses: some tart, some<br />\nsubtle, some funny, and all<br />\neloquent.<br />\nNaturally, some persons will<br />\ncomplain that Buckley, in<br />\nrecording his life in such a journal, is committing an act of<br />\ngreat egotism and conceit. Yet<br /><br />\nthe autobiography is a common<br />\nand accepted form of<br />\nbiography, and Buckley simply<br />\nchooses to record his life in the<br />\npresent and as an excerpt. He<br />\nhad done the same thing for a<br />\nweek in December 1970, and<br />\nthe result was a book entitled<br />\nCruising Speed. That endeavor,<br />\nwrites Buckley, \"had in my<br />\njudgment succeeded in exploring an unusual device for<br />\nautobiographical revelation\u2014<br />\neasier to execute and, in some<br />\nways, potentially more revealing than the more comprehensive conventional treatments.\"<br />\nBuckley's style is elegant and<br />\nsophisticated. The book is full<br />\nof classy Latin phrases that<br />\nnobody understands but which<br />\nserve as reminders of the<br />\nauthor's erudition. The text<br />\nmakes for fast reading and is by<br />\nno means a political treatise or<br />\nattempt to persuade or reform.<br /><br />\nin any way the casual reader.<br />\nOne does not have to be a<br />\nBuckley groupie to enjoy Overdrive. Even if the politics<br />\nand the lifestyle offend,<br />\nBuckley is nonetheless an interesting and influential individual. Furthermore, he is<br />\nsuch a talented writer that onel<br />\ncan read the book merely to appreciate and perhaps absorb the<br />\nrich vocabulary and amazing<br />\nsentence patterns.<br />\nOverdrive offers a personal<br />\naccount of his success in a<br />\nunique and exciting combination that truly captures the<br />\nreader. Perhaps, there is a little<br />\nfluff, an extra mention of the<br />\nPresident here, a piece of<br />\nsuperfluous information there.<br />\nBut such is, perhaps, the real<br />\nBuckley.<br /><br />\nDoug Fellman<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nArts<br />\nNo, Not Tonight Dear...<br />\nby Gigi Mark<br />\nI DO!

Not only did he<br />\nbreak his career hitless streak<br />\nagainst the Chicago White Sox,<br />\nhe also came up with the quote<br />\nof the year: In a game against<br />\nthe Toronto Blue jays, Orioles<br />\npitcher Tippy Martinez picked<br /><br />\nthree runners off the first base<br />\nin one inning. Sakata was<br />\nbehind the plate (Lenn is normally a utility infielder), and he<br />\nrevealed that he was glad that<br />\nhe didn't have to reveal his<br />\n\"secret weapon\u2014the one-hop<br />\nthrow to second base.\"<br />\nAnd here it is\u2014the boo of<br />\nthe year\u2014presented to the<br />\nUnited States Football League,<br />\nfor trying to pass off a minor<br />\nleague product at major league<br />\nprices.
