Several undergraduates, who had been attracted from other universities to<br />\nour campus, together with several<br />\nof our own native genius, felt<br />\nHopkins should have an honor<br />\nsystem. Accordingly, they started a discussion, which culminated<br />\nin conferences between faculty<br />\nand istudent representatives, and,<br />\nfinally, in the drafting of a set<br />\nof resolutions, which were approved by the faculty, and later<br />\nat a mass meeting by the undergraduates. This, in a word, is<br />\nthe story of the birth of our honor<br />\nsystem.<br />\nPrior to that time there was<br />\nno definite system. The conduct<br />\nof examinations was left entirely<br />\nto the discretion .of the instructors, who came and went at will,<br />\nputting their trust in the honor<br />\nof Hopkins men. In fact, any<br />\nother course of procedure little<br />\noccurred to either faculty or. examiners. We are proud that the<br />\nevil system of policing was not<br />\nin vogue. At many large uni-<br />\n<br />\nversities the students were under<br />\nthe watchful eye of proctors, who<br />\nparaded the examination rooms<br />\n\u2014and, indeed, such a system is<br />\nstill in wide use.<br />\nThe need for such odious supervision was never felt at Hopkins;<br />\nhowever, for the good of all concerned, the present more definite<br />\nand uniform, though perhaps less<br />\nidealistic, system was adopted.<br />\nIt 'is gratifying that it is not<br />\nencumbered with a set of objecMonable iron-bound rules. The<br />\nsigning of the pledge printed on<br />\nthe exam book, be it understood<br />\nby all new-comers, is in no wise<br />\nobligatory; the Student Council<br />\nmerely recommends it to the students. It is easily conceivable<br />\nthat some may be offended by<br />\nhaving the question put them;<br />\nand, indeed, in the days when the<br />\nscheme was first tried, many refused to sign. It would be condemnable if Hopkins men were to<br />\nbe coerced, either by Student<br />\nCouncil or instructor, into obeying such rules. It has, indeed,<br />\nbeen argued that a man dishonest enough to cheat in an examination would not hesitate to sign<br />\nan untrue statement; yet there<br />\nmay be some weak, misguided<br />\nindividuals, upon whom the<br />\nknowledge that they are expected<br />\nto state that they have neither<br />\ngiven nor received help may<br />\nhave a salutory effect.<br />\nThe<br />\nraison d'etre pledge is protection<br />\nagainst, and aid for such weaklings, and an appreciation of the<br />\nconfidence the faculty has reposed<br />\nin us; it is not at all a reflection<br />\nupon the integrity of Hopkins<br />\nmen. This point should be clearly<br />\nunderstood by any who object to<br />\nsigning.<br />\nThe Student Council has the<br />\nright\u2014and it should have\u2014to<br />\neject from the University any<br />\ntransgressor of the laws of honor<br />\nin examination, for he is not a<br />\nfit associate for college men.<br />\nMerely as a matter of caution\u2014<br />\nthat our honor system might be<br />\nfully understood \u2014 the explanatory slips were distributed last<br />\nweek. It is regrettable that the<br />\ngreat bulk of students must be<br />\nimposed upon by such explanations and such a pledge\u2014and, indeed, by any definite system<br />\nwhatever; but it must be realized that they are an aid to<br />\nweaker brothers, from whom only<br />\na Salomon's House is free.<br />\nSweet Is Pleasure After Pain.<br />\n<br />\nWe, for the most part, are not<br />\nshirkers, but men trying to make<br />\nthe most of university life. It is<br />\nin accordance with this motive<br />\nalone that the sugestion is made<br />\nthat exams be followed by a period of respite\u2014a custom maintained by most of the larger colleges and universities.<br />\nBefore 1916 when the two-term<br />\nyear was inaugurated at Hopkins, each set of examinations<br />\nwas succeeded by a vacation\u2014<br />\nChristmas, Easter and summer.<br />\n<br />\nSpurred by this anticipation, the<br />\nstudent put his very best into<br />\npreparation for the test. Then,<br />\ntoo, it. is noticeable that when<br />\nthere is no recess after examinations, the subsequent week is invariably marked by a minimum<br />\nof work. There is a distinct letdown from the real or imagined<br />\nstrain; hence, the majority derive little benefit from the week<br />\nof instruction. The same principle applies that has led employers\u2014or at least our worthy political economists\u2014to believe that a<br />\nworkman can actually accomplish<br />\nmore in an eight or ten-hour day<br />\nthan in one of ten or twelve.<br />\nHereafter, the authors of the<br />\nyear's schedule can offer no excuse of wartime pressure, which<br />\nmay be advanced this year. We<br />\nhope that, in the future, whether<br />\nthe two-term year holds or not,<br />\nthe University authorities, with<br />\ntheir wonted benevolence, will<br />\nmake provision for post-exam<br />\nrecreation.<br />\nRFADY FOR BIG INDOOR MEET<br />\n<br />\nthirirtg<br />\n3Brattb<br />\nTintilrg<br />\n--With that<br />\nsomething<br />\nthat college<br />\nmen like<br />\n<br />\nPine 100111\u2022 Hub<br />\nBaltimore Street At Charles<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br />\n<br />\nState and Catholic University<br />\nare to be heard from.

Professor Hollander thereafter describes in detail the<br />\nthirty-one issues of certificates of<br />\nindebtedness emitted by the<br />\nTreasury in connection with our<br />\nwar financing.<br />\nThis book is of especial interest<br />\nto all economists and students of<br />\npolitical economy, because in the<br />\nsucceeding chapters the direct<br />\nfiscal results of the Treasury's<br />\npolicy in this connection are analyzed, and its collateral effects<br />\nupon the business world, through<br />\nthe money-market, and upon social well-being, through the price<br />\nlevel, are traced.<br />\nThe conclusion of the text is<br />\nalso of importance. Professor<br />\nHollander maintains that past<br />\nexperience, theoretical analysis,<br />\nand present evidence all point to<br />\nthe conclusion that our war borrowing, sound and admirable in<br />\nthe main, has been marred here<br />\nand there by serious error, injuring us now, and certain if unamended to work to our disadvantage hereafter.<br />\nIn his final chapter he presents<br />\nin a most convincing manner certain positive and practical suggestions with respect to the<br />\nfuture.<br />\n<br />\nHAT TIPS<br />\nThe man who \"hates to buy<br />\na hat,\" will find the experience a pleasant one here.<br />\nEnough of a variety to please<br />\nany and every preference.<br />\nDunlap, Stetson, etc.<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\n..Q1jALITY0110P<br />\nCollar tht Clothes<br />\n<br />\n!diPd,1b21gyJhwts<br />\n<br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br />\n<br />\nJAS.

This test was found by<br />\nboth the Americans and British<br />\nto be useless.<br />\nThe psychological problems of<br />\naviation were investigated under<br />\nthe direction of the Medical Research Board, a branch of the<br />\nAir Medical Service. Dr. Dunlap began work at the Bureau of<br />\nMines Laboratory in October,<br />\n1917, with two assistants and<br />\ncontinued in charge of the Psychological Department until August 30, 1918, on which date he<br />\nwas transferred from the Mineola<br />\nLaboratory. During this period<br />\nhis staff grew to about twentyfive officers and seventeen men.<br />\nThe first work required of the<br />\nboard was the construction and<br />\nstandardization of a test for determining, if possible, the individual flier's ability to endure the<br />\npartial asphyxiation incident to<br />\nhigh altitudes. Dr. Dunlap entered this work with the understanding that, as soon as such a<br />\ntest was completed, he should<br />\nhave opportunity to investigate<br />\nother more important psycho.<br />\nphysical problems, because he<br />\nwas unwilling to disorganize his<br />\nuniversity work merely for the<br />\ndevelopment of such a test.<br />\nStarting -on an entirely unknown sea, Dr. Dunlap and his<br />\nsmall, but highly efficient, staff<br />\nwere able to get results in a relatively short time. After trying a<br />\nwide range of standard psychophysical tests, and some devised<br />\nafter the usual patterns, with<br />\npuzzling results, the actual primary effects of asphyxia were hit<br />\nupon and tests were devised to fit.<br />\nSome important observations<br />\nwere made on psychological causing accidents (although no research was done) from accidents<br />\nin the low pressure chamber and<br />\nfrom study of air accidents, it<br />\nwas not evident that the painful<br />\nstimulation of air pressure inward on the ear drum, may (aside<br />\nfrom any lesion of the membrane<br />\nproduce mental incompetence, and<br />\napparent unconsciousness.

Several undergraduates, who had been attracted from other universities to<br />\nour campus, together with several<br />\nof our own native genius, felt<br />\nHopkins should have an honor<br />\nsystem. Accordingly, they started a discussion, which culminated<br />\nin conferences between faculty<br />\nand istudent representatives, and,<br />\nfinally, in the drafting of a set<br />\nof resolutions, which were approved by the faculty, and later<br />\nat a mass meeting by the undergraduates. This, in a word, is<br />\nthe story of the birth of our honor<br />\nsystem.<br />\nPrior to that time there was<br />\nno definite system. The conduct<br />\nof examinations was left entirely<br />\nto the discretion .of the instructors, who came and went at will,<br />\nputting their trust in the honor<br />\nof Hopkins men. In fact, any<br />\nother course of procedure little<br />\noccurred to either faculty or. examiners. We are proud that the<br />\nevil system of policing was not<br />\nin vogue. At many large uni-<br /><br />\nversities the students were under<br />\nthe watchful eye of proctors, who<br />\nparaded the examination rooms<br />\n\u2014and, indeed, such a system is<br />\nstill in wide use.<br />\nThe need for such odious supervision was never felt at Hopkins;<br />\nhowever, for the good of all concerned, the present more definite<br />\nand uniform, though perhaps less<br />\nidealistic, system was adopted.<br />\nIt 'is gratifying that it is not<br />\nencumbered with a set of objecMonable iron-bound rules. The<br />\nsigning of the pledge printed on<br />\nthe exam book, be it understood<br />\nby all new-comers, is in no wise<br />\nobligatory; the Student Council<br />\nmerely recommends it to the students. It is easily conceivable<br />\nthat some may be offended by<br />\nhaving the question put them;<br />\nand, indeed, in the days when the<br />\nscheme was first tried, many refused to sign. It would be condemnable if Hopkins men were to<br />\nbe coerced, either by Student<br />\nCouncil or instructor, into obeying such rules. It has, indeed,<br />\nbeen argued that a man dishonest enough to cheat in an examination would not hesitate to sign<br />\nan untrue statement; yet there<br />\nmay be some weak, misguided<br />\nindividuals, upon whom the<br />\nknowledge that they are expected<br />\nto state that they have neither<br />\ngiven nor received help may<br />\nhave a salutory effect.<br />\nThe<br />\nraison d'etre pledge is protection<br />\nagainst, and aid for such weaklings, and an appreciation of the<br />\nconfidence the faculty has reposed<br />\nin us; it is not at all a reflection<br />\nupon the integrity of Hopkins<br />\nmen. This point should be clearly<br />\nunderstood by any who object to<br />\nsigning.<br />\nThe Student Council has the<br />\nright\u2014and it should have\u2014to<br />\neject from the University any<br />\ntransgressor of the laws of honor<br />\nin examination, for he is not a<br />\nfit associate for college men.<br />\nMerely as a matter of caution\u2014<br />\nthat our honor system might be<br />\nfully understood \u2014 the explanatory slips were distributed last<br />\nweek. It is regrettable that the<br />\ngreat bulk of students must be<br />\nimposed upon by such explanations and such a pledge\u2014and, indeed, by any definite system<br />\nwhatever; but it must be realized that they are an aid to<br />\nweaker brothers, from whom only<br />\na Salomon's House is free.<br />\nSweet Is Pleasure After Pain.<br /><br />\nWe, for the most part, are not<br />\nshirkers, but men trying to make<br />\nthe most of university life. It is<br />\nin accordance with this motive<br />\nalone that the sugestion is made<br />\nthat exams be followed by a period of respite\u2014a custom maintained by most of the larger colleges and universities.<br />\nBefore 1916 when the two-term<br />\nyear was inaugurated at Hopkins, each set of examinations<br />\nwas succeeded by a vacation\u2014<br />\nChristmas, Easter and summer.<br /><br />\nSpurred by this anticipation, the<br />\nstudent put his very best into<br />\npreparation for the test. Then,<br />\ntoo, it. is noticeable that when<br />\nthere is no recess after examinations, the subsequent week is invariably marked by a minimum<br />\nof work. There is a distinct letdown from the real or imagined<br />\nstrain; hence, the majority derive little benefit from the week<br />\nof instruction. The same principle applies that has led employers\u2014or at least our worthy political economists\u2014to believe that a<br />\nworkman can actually accomplish<br />\nmore in an eight or ten-hour day<br />\nthan in one of ten or twelve.<br />\nHereafter, the authors of the<br />\nyear's schedule can offer no excuse of wartime pressure, which<br />\nmay be advanced this year. We<br />\nhope that, in the future, whether<br />\nthe two-term year holds or not,<br />\nthe University authorities, with<br />\ntheir wonted benevolence, will<br />\nmake provision for post-exam<br />\nrecreation.<br />\nRFADY FOR BIG INDOOR MEET<br /><br />\nthirirtg<br />\n3Brattb<br />\nTintilrg<br />\n--With that<br />\nsomething<br />\nthat college<br />\nmen like<br /><br />\nPine 100111\u2022 Hub<br />\nBaltimore Street At Charles<br /><br />\n(Continued from page I)<br /><br />\nState and Catholic University<br />\nare to be heard from.

I speak<br />\nof the morning chapel service.<br />\nThere is not room to discuss the<br />\nmanner of holding such chapels<br />\nin the various universities, but I<br />\nWill state a few common characteristics.<br />\nThe chapel service is usually of<br />\nfifteen to twenty minutes in<br />\nlength four days of the week, and<br />\none hour on Friday. The service<br />\nis conducted by the Dean or<br />\nPresident who opens with a reading from the Bible. Several<br />\nsacred and college songs follow,<br />\nand then either the presiding<br />\nofficer or an outside speaker gives<br />\na ten-minute talk. The exercise<br />\nis concluded with the reading of<br />\nannouncements of all student and<br />\ncollegiate activities whicli merit<br />\nthe attention of the undergraduate body for that day. On Friday a prominent speaker, is secured to give a vocational or<br />\npopular talk.<br />\nThe opening part of the exercise gives a moment of thought<br />\nto the sacred to which no one<br />\nhas been entirely foreign, at<br />\nleast before the entrance to the<br />\nUniversity. The talk refreshes<br />\nthe interest of the students; and<br />\nthe announcements are the students themselves, so as to speak,<br />\nthe best way to get spirit and<br />\nco-operation in all activities.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins is not a denominational institute, is it necessary or wise to avoid having a<br />\nchapel, which is such a fundamental part of student life in<br />\nA.

These<br />\ncenters, located in the poorer districts of the city, furnish healthful recreation for the younger<br />\nchildren after school hours by instruction in games of basketball,<br />\nbaseball and soccer, as well as<br />\nvocational training such as woodwork, basket weaving, manual<br />\ntraining and photography.<br />\nThe leaders and instructors are<br />\nmembers of the various universities, colleges and clubs in town.<br />\nHopkins has several men at the.<br />\ndifferent community houses, who<br />\ngive from one to two evenings a<br />\nweek for this social service work.<br />\nThis activity holds special interest for those who are taking<br />\ncourses in social science.

During the war the Union<br />\nhas maintained an American center and University Club in Paris<br />\nwhere between 25,000 and 30,000<br />\nformer students of American universities, now engaged in military<br />\nservice in Europe, have registered. The Municipal Council of<br />\nParis has presented to the<br />\n\"Maison des Etudants,\" a valuable piece of ground as a site for<br />\na building to serve as a center<br />\nfor American students in Paris.<br />\nThe association of these two<br />\norganizations will probably bring<br />\nabout a closer union of American<br />\nand French intellectual and academic interests.<br />\nDr. Goodnow is a charter member of \"Maison des Etudants.\"<br /><br />\ncould be arranged that would be<br />\nsatisfactory for all.

Professor Hollander thereafter describes in detail the<br />\nthirty-one issues of certificates of<br />\nindebtedness emitted by the<br />\nTreasury in connection with our<br />\nwar financing.<br />\nThis book is of especial interest<br />\nto all economists and students of<br />\npolitical economy, because in the<br />\nsucceeding chapters the direct<br />\nfiscal results of the Treasury's<br />\npolicy in this connection are analyzed, and its collateral effects<br />\nupon the business world, through<br />\nthe money-market, and upon social well-being, through the price<br />\nlevel, are traced.<br />\nThe conclusion of the text is<br />\nalso of importance. Professor<br />\nHollander maintains that past<br />\nexperience, theoretical analysis,<br />\nand present evidence all point to<br />\nthe conclusion that our war borrowing, sound and admirable in<br />\nthe main, has been marred here<br />\nand there by serious error, injuring us now, and certain if unamended to work to our disadvantage hereafter.<br />\nIn his final chapter he presents<br />\nin a most convincing manner certain positive and practical suggestions with respect to the<br />\nfuture.<br /><br />\nHAT TIPS<br />\nThe man who \"hates to buy<br />\na hat,\" will find the experience a pleasant one here.<br />\nEnough of a variety to please<br />\nany and every preference.<br />\nDunlap, Stetson, etc.<br />\nE<br /><br />\n..Q1jALITY0110P<br />\nCollar tht Clothes<br /><br />\n!diPd,1b21gyJhwts<br /><br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br /><br />\nJAS.
