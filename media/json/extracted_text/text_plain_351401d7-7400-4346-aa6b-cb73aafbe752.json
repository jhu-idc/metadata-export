The present system of a<br />\nroll call before or during the<br />\ngames has proved ineffective, cumbersome and tedious, and is<br />\ntherefore to be abandoned. Instead, each freshman who attends<br />\na game will be given a card which<br />\nhe must wear during the following week to show that he was<br />\npresent at Homewood on the preceding Saturday. Failure to display a card will arouse the interest of the Sophomores with wellknown consequences.<br />\nAny man who expects to be<br />\nabsent from a game who can show<br />\na valid reason for staying away<br />\nwill present his case at the<br />\nStudent Council office in the Barn<br />\nduring the previous week and receive a card similar to those distributed at the field. It will<br />\ntherefore be assumed that those<br />\nwithout cards on Monday were<br />\nabsent from the preceding game<br />\nwithout excuse, and that some<br />\nslight assistance on the path to<br />\ncollege spirit is in order. Freshmen who were present at the<br />\nMount St. Mary's game or were<br />\nexcused will be issued cards on<br />\nMonday and Tuesday of this week<br />\nand will be expdcted to wear them<br />\non Wednesday.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL COMPETITION<br />\nThe competition open to students of the University for a<br />\nposition on the editorial board<br />\nopened Monday. At this time<br />\na number of candidates reported, but in order that more<br />\nmay be secured the NEWS-LETTER office will be open every day<br />\nthis week between 12.30 and 1<br />\nto receive those who wish to<br />\nenter the contest. All men interested are requested to come<br />\nto the office, so that the conditions governing the competition may be explained.<br />\nThere is an excellent chance<br />\nFor all possessing reasonable<br />\neditorial or reportorial ability,<br />\nas there are many vacancies on<br />\nthe staff.

Outweighed over 10 pounds to the man, the Black and Blue<br />\nfought the big Orange team up and down the fields, and were forced<br />\nback only after being worn out by the continuous pounding of heavy<br />\nmen. The bare statement of the score gives little idea of the great<br />\nbattle which the Homewood men put up and of the strength of their<br />\ngame.<br />\nDuring the entire first half the<br />\nstiff defense of the Hopkins team<br />\nheld the Syracuse squad to a single touchdown, scored during the<br />\nfirst quarter after a dash of 50<br />\nyards by Abbott, who eluded his<br />\nopponents by a fine display of<br />\nbroken field running. Twice in the<br />\nsecond period the Orange team<br />\nworked the ball down the field to<br />\nwithin a few yards of the Hopkins goal, only to be held for<br />\ndOWRS or to lose the pigskin on a<br />\nfumble. Thus the first half ended<br />\nwith the count 7-0, and the Syracuse team apparently baffled in<br />\ntheir attempt to run ,up a large<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe second half, however, told<br />\na different story. Puzzled by the<br />\nfailure of his men to pierce the<br />\ndefense of the far lighter Johns<br />\nHopkins team, Chick Meehan, the<br />\nSyracuse coach, sent them back<br />\ninto the game with orders for a<br />\ndifferent style of defense, and<br />\ngradually saw the superior weight<br />\nand power of his charges sweep<br />\nthe ball down the field for a succession of touchdown.<br />\nThree<br />\ntimes Kellogg crossed the line,<br />\nand each time Abbott added another point by kicking goal. In<br />\nthe final quarter Syracuse scored<br />\ntwice, each time aided by inopportune fumbles on the part of<br />\nHopkins' back. The final count<br />\nfor the New Yorkers was registered by Gulick, right tackle for<br />\nthe Orange team, who scored a<br />\npretty kick from placement from<br />\nthe 35-yard line.<br />\nThe game was marked, from a<br />\nSyracuse standpoint, by\u2022the great<br />\nwork of Fallon, Kellogg and Abbott, the latter their all around<br />\nstar. Hopkins' most consistent<br />\nground-gainer was Calkins, who,<br />\nalthough he made no sensational<br />\nplunges, was always ready with<br />\na few yards when they were most<br />\nneeded. He also did most of the<br />\npunting, and made some mighty<br />\n<br />\nfine kicks.<br />\n\"Jenk\" Cromwell<br />\ncame in for his share of glory<br />\nwhen he battled his 190-pound opponent, Alexander, off his feet during the early part of the game.<br />\nAlexander was chosen as all-American guard last year by Walter<br />\nCamp. Elmer Jones and Bill<br />\n'Wood also did fine work.<br />\nSyracuse lost a good deal of<br />\nground by frequent penalties for<br />\nholding and for off-side play, while<br />\nJohns Hopkins was set back only<br />\nonce.<br />\nWhile 45 to 0 seems to be, and,<br />\nin fact is, an overwhelming score,<br />\nthere are other points beside the<br />\nmere total which should be taken<br />\ninto account. When -it is remembered that there was such a heavy<br />\nadvantage in weight on the side<br />\nof Syracuse, and that the Orange<br />\nteam is considered to be one of<br />\nthe strongest in the country, a<br />\ngreat deal of credit must be given<br />\nthe Black and Blue for the plucky<br />\ntight which it put up and for the<br />\nfine game it played in the face of<br />\nalmost overwhelming odds.

The<br />\nteam this year has less promising<br />\nmaterial than ever before, as there<br />\nare very few stars from prep school<br />\nand but few regular string men<br />\nfrom last year out for the squad.<br />\nIt is the aim of the manager and<br />\ncoaches to have a thorough fall<br />\npractice to develop more accurate<br />\nstick work, in as much as the material on hand is not up to the<br />\nusual standard of the last few<br />\nyears. Practice will be held three<br />\ntimes a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays on the upper<br />\nquadrangle in front of Gilman<br />\nHall. It is decided that complete<br />\nlacrosse clothes will not be necessary, as the practice will be centered on stick work and a general work-out, which will provide<br />\na base to start on in the spring.<br />\nThere will be no attempt at training and men will not be needed<br />\nto restrict their diet or to. stop<br />\nsmoking.<br />\nThere are some men now practicing with the football team who<br />\nwill not be able to report for lacrosse until spring, but all others<br />\nwho wish to make the team next<br />\nyear will find this practice necessary to develop accuracy in stick<br />\nwork. Captain Griffiss finds that<br />\nthere is a notable lack of \"lacrosse<br />\nbrains,\" which will necessitate<br />\nharder and more frequent practices.<br />\nBUSINESS COMPETITION<br />\nThe competition open to students of the University for a position on the businessdepartment<br />\nof the Nnws-LETTER will begin<br />\nWednesday.

All<br />\nstudents from .lands other than<br />\nthe United States are asked to be<br />\npresent. The home of Dr. Kelly<br />\nis as complete a museum as one is<br />\nable to find anywhere in the city.<br />\nOne of the important matters<br />\nto be taken up at this meeting is<br />\nthe possibility and advisability of<br />\nforming a cosmopolitan club at<br />\nthe University. At all the other<br />\nlarge important universities in<br />\nthe United .States there are such<br />\nclubs formed with the purpose of<br />\nfellowship and exchange of opinions. Most of the foreign students<br />\nat John Hopkins visit during the<br />\nsummer the various nearby universities, where they have seen the<br />\nvalue of such a club, and they<br />\nrightly feel that Johns Hopkins<br />\nshould not fall behind in this matter.<br />\nIn the University proper there<br />\nare this year eighteen foreign<br />\nstudents, representing eight countries, Peru, Spain, Philippine Islands, Mexico, Japan, China, Jamaica and Porto Rico.

The present system of a<br />\nroll call before or during the<br />\ngames has proved ineffective, cumbersome and tedious, and is<br />\ntherefore to be abandoned. Instead, each freshman who attends<br />\na game will be given a card which<br />\nhe must wear during the following week to show that he was<br />\npresent at Homewood on the preceding Saturday. Failure to display a card will arouse the interest of the Sophomores with wellknown consequences.<br />\nAny man who expects to be<br />\nabsent from a game who can show<br />\na valid reason for staying away<br />\nwill present his case at the<br />\nStudent Council office in the Barn<br />\nduring the previous week and receive a card similar to those distributed at the field. It will<br />\ntherefore be assumed that those<br />\nwithout cards on Monday were<br />\nabsent from the preceding game<br />\nwithout excuse, and that some<br />\nslight assistance on the path to<br />\ncollege spirit is in order. Freshmen who were present at the<br />\nMount St. Mary's game or were<br />\nexcused will be issued cards on<br />\nMonday and Tuesday of this week<br />\nand will be expdcted to wear them<br />\non Wednesday.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL COMPETITION<br />\nThe competition open to students of the University for a<br />\nposition on the editorial board<br />\nopened Monday.

All men interested are requested to come<br />\nto the office, so that the conditions governing the competition may be explained.<br />\nThere is an excellent chance<br />\nFor all possessing reasonable<br />\neditorial or reportorial ability,<br />\nas there are many vacancies on<br />\nthe staff.

Outweighed over 10 pounds to the man, the Black and Blue<br />\nfought the big Orange team up and down the fields, and were forced<br />\nback only after being worn out by the continuous pounding of heavy<br />\nmen. The bare statement of the score gives little idea of the great<br />\nbattle which the Homewood men put up and of the strength of their<br />\ngame.<br />\nDuring the entire first half the<br />\nstiff defense of the Hopkins team<br />\nheld the Syracuse squad to a single touchdown, scored during the<br />\nfirst quarter after a dash of 50<br />\nyards by Abbott, who eluded his<br />\nopponents by a fine display of<br />\nbroken field running. Twice in the<br />\nsecond period the Orange team<br />\nworked the ball down the field to<br />\nwithin a few yards of the Hopkins goal, only to be held for<br />\ndOWRS or to lose the pigskin on a<br />\nfumble. Thus the first half ended<br />\nwith the count 7-0, and the Syracuse team apparently baffled in<br />\ntheir attempt to run ,up a large<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe second half, however, told<br />\na different story. Puzzled by the<br />\nfailure of his men to pierce the<br />\ndefense of the far lighter Johns<br />\nHopkins team, Chick Meehan, the<br />\nSyracuse coach, sent them back<br />\ninto the game with orders for a<br />\ndifferent style of defense, and<br />\ngradually saw the superior weight<br />\nand power of his charges sweep<br />\nthe ball down the field for a succession of touchdown.<br />\nThree<br />\ntimes Kellogg crossed the line,<br />\nand each time Abbott added another point by kicking goal. In<br />\nthe final quarter Syracuse scored<br />\ntwice, each time aided by inopportune fumbles on the part of<br />\nHopkins' back. The final count<br />\nfor the New Yorkers was registered by Gulick, right tackle for<br />\nthe Orange team, who scored a<br />\npretty kick from placement from<br />\nthe 35-yard line.<br />\nThe game was marked, from a<br />\nSyracuse standpoint, by\u2022the great<br />\nwork of Fallon, Kellogg and Abbott, the latter their all around<br />\nstar. Hopkins' most consistent<br />\nground-gainer was Calkins, who,<br />\nalthough he made no sensational<br />\nplunges, was always ready with<br />\na few yards when they were most<br />\nneeded. He also did most of the<br />\npunting, and made some mighty<br /><br />\nfine kicks.<br />\n\"Jenk\" Cromwell<br />\ncame in for his share of glory<br />\nwhen he battled his 190-pound opponent, Alexander, off his feet during the early part of the game.<br />\nAlexander was chosen as all-American guard last year by Walter<br />\nCamp. Elmer Jones and Bill<br />\n'Wood also did fine work.<br />\nSyracuse lost a good deal of<br />\nground by frequent penalties for<br />\nholding and for off-side play, while<br />\nJohns Hopkins was set back only<br />\nonce.<br />\nWhile 45 to 0 seems to be, and,<br />\nin fact is, an overwhelming score,<br />\nthere are other points beside the<br />\nmere total which should be taken<br />\ninto account. When -it is remembered that there was such a heavy<br />\nadvantage in weight on the side<br />\nof Syracuse, and that the Orange<br />\nteam is considered to be one of<br />\nthe strongest in the country, a<br />\ngreat deal of credit must be given<br />\nthe Black and Blue for the plucky<br />\ntight which it put up and for the<br />\nfine game it played in the face of<br />\nalmost overwhelming odds.

Schedule<br />\nNot Yet Arranged.<br /><br />\nThe first practice of the 1921<br />\nlacrosse team took place on Wednesday afternoon at 4 o'clock. The<br />\nteam this year has less promising<br />\nmaterial than ever before, as there<br />\nare very few stars from prep school<br />\nand but few regular string men<br />\nfrom last year out for the squad.<br />\nIt is the aim of the manager and<br />\ncoaches to have a thorough fall<br />\npractice to develop more accurate<br />\nstick work, in as much as the material on hand is not up to the<br />\nusual standard of the last few<br />\nyears. Practice will be held three<br />\ntimes a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays on the upper<br />\nquadrangle in front of Gilman<br />\nHall. It is decided that complete<br />\nlacrosse clothes will not be necessary, as the practice will be centered on stick work and a general work-out, which will provide<br />\na base to start on in the spring.<br />\nThere will be no attempt at training and men will not be needed<br />\nto restrict their diet or to. stop<br />\nsmoking.<br />\nThere are some men now practicing with the football team who<br />\nwill not be able to report for lacrosse until spring, but all others<br />\nwho wish to make the team next<br />\nyear will find this practice necessary to develop accuracy in stick<br />\nwork. Captain Griffiss finds that<br />\nthere is a notable lack of \"lacrosse<br />\nbrains,\" which will necessitate<br />\nharder and more frequent practices.<br />\nBUSINESS COMPETITION<br />\nThe competition open to students of the University for a position on the businessdepartment<br />\nof the Nnws-LETTER will begin<br />\nWednesday.

Bartus Trew, president<br />\nof the club, has again secured the<br />\nservices of Miss Walter, who<br />\ncoached the productions of the<br />\nlast two years so successfully.

M. C. A. NOTES<br />\nFund Growing Rapidly.<br /><br />\nThe efforts of the University Y.<br />\nM. C. A. to meet the year's budget<br />\nthrough contributions from the<br />\nundergraduate student body have<br />\nmet with very satisfactory results.<br />\n. Though as ,yet incomplete, the<br />\ncampaign is viewed with unqualified satisfaction due to the unusual readiness which students<br />\nhave shown in responding to the<br />\nappeal.<br />\nAn attempt will be made during the early part of the week to<br />\nmeet every one not yet seen, thus<br />\nmaking it an every man campaign.<br />\nAmong the freshmen practically<br />\nall have responded with a substantial pledge, thus continuing<br />\nthe exhibition of spirit and interest manifested recently at the<br />\nfreshman reception. The success<br />\nof the campaign is accepted as an<br />\nindication of the general interest<br />\nand approval of this important<br />\nbranch of our student life.<br />\nAll who have not done so are<br />\nurged to -secure a card and speedily have his contribution\u2014pledge<br />\nor money\u2014at the \"Y\" office .in the<br />\nBarn, where Mr. E. Pearce Hayes<br />\nor some representative will always be ready to receive such returns.<br />\nForeign Students' Reception.<br /><br />\nThe V. M. C. A. has arranged<br />\nthe opening reception of the year<br />\nfor men from other lands to be<br />\nheld at the home of Dr. Howard<br />\nA. Kelly, 1406 Eutaw Place, Friday, October 15, at 8 P. M. All<br />\nstudents from .lands other than<br />\nthe United States are asked to be<br />\npresent. The home of Dr. Kelly<br />\nis as complete a museum as one is<br />\nable to find anywhere in the city.<br />\nOne of the important matters<br />\nto be taken up at this meeting is<br />\nthe possibility and advisability of<br />\nforming a cosmopolitan club at<br />\nthe University. At all the other<br />\nlarge important universities in<br />\nthe United .States there are such<br />\nclubs formed with the purpose of<br />\nfellowship and exchange of opinions. Most of the foreign students<br />\nat John Hopkins visit during the<br />\nsummer the various nearby universities, where they have seen the<br />\nvalue of such a club, and they<br />\nrightly feel that Johns Hopkins<br />\nshould not fall behind in this matter.<br />\nIn the University proper there<br />\nare this year eighteen foreign<br />\nstudents, representing eight countries, Peru, Spain, Philippine Islands, Mexico, Japan, China, Jamaica and Porto Rico. Practically<br />\nall of these men are of prominent<br />\nfamilies and are going back to<br />\ntake conspicuous places in their<br />\ncountries.<br /><br />\nJ. H.

The University Y. M. C. A. is<br />\nplanning this winter to conduct<br />\nmany such classes with these men,<br />\nall to be led by Hopkins undergraduates. The total number of<br />\nstudents needed will be about<br />\nfifty. These men will be asked to<br />\ngive one night a week to help in<br />\nthis constructive program to offset<br />\nthe social unrest among the unAmericanized foreigners in our<br />\nmidst.

E.<br />\nBuilding. More than fifty men<br />\nwere present as .candidates either<br />\nfor the Glee Club or the Instrumental Club. This large number<br />\nof candidates will make greater<br />\ncompetition and will insure a club<br />\nthat will be better than that of<br />\nlast year.<br />\nThe prospects of a<br />\nsnappy jazz band seem excellent<br />\nas two saxophones and a clarinet<br />\nwill be added to the other instruments and will make synchopated<br />\nmusic to rival any of its kind. As<br />\nthere are a somewhat limited<br />\nnumber of guitars the competition<br />\namong the mandolins will be<br />\nstrong. The Glee Club is fortunate in the great number of first<br />\ntenors who have come out. These<br />\nare usually scarce and have to be<br />\nsought for personally by the management. The other parts are well<br />\nrepresented. Several new, original and clever individual stunts<br />\nwill be used to complete a program which will put the Musical<br />\nClub of Hopkins on a plane higher<br />\nthan that ever obtained.<br />\nThe prospect of a successful season, with a fine representative<br />\nshowing at every concert is highly<br />\nencouraging. The opportunity to<br />\njoin is still open. Every man with<br />\nany musical ability or knowledge<br />\nof some clever individual stunt is<br />\nheartily urged to attend the rehearsals and is assured an opportunity to make the club.
