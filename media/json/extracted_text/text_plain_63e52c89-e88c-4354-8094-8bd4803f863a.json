I have merely subscribed to<br />\nan accepted institution in an accepted.. way. In retrospect, it appears that my indoctrination was<br />\nslightly one-sided.

I acknowledged the need; I understood the principle; I respected<br />\nthe' tradition.

In effect<br />\nwhat's your opinion?<br />\nI feel that these are questione<br />\nwhich everyone should ask; answers which the Honor Commission should seek.

This meet should<br />\nbit of time working out defensive<br />\n\u2014the offensive formation. The T. is completely dependent on patterns. In scrimmage they<br />\nbe just about the toughest on the<br />\nthis<br />\nweek.<br />\nseem<br />\nteam's<br />\nschedule, and it is hoping<br />\nsuccessful ball handling not only by the quarterback but by to be shaping up fairly quickly, The meeting<br />\nwas originally to average the<br />\n29-26 setback that<br />\ntile other backs also. Why then should a team that seems to be and most of the positions on the planned for Levering Hall.<br />\nF &amp; M gave it last year in the<br />\nfirst<br />\neleven<br />\nseem<br />\nto be filled.<br />\nhaving trouble holding onto the ball be forced to handle the ball<br />\nopening meet here.<br />\nIn the backfield Turner will<br />\nanymore than is necessary. If the center of the line which<br />\nprobably have Dick Watts at right<br />\nhas been outweighed in just about every game can't hold on halfback, John Steers at left<br />\nAre you a connoisseur<br />\nsome vital play, the quarterback and whomever he is handing the halfback, and Charlie Davis at<br />\nof something different in FOOD?<br />\nball to are going to end up playing hot potato with it, a dangerous fullback. The quarterback slot<br />\nif so, try our<br />\nat present is a draw between Arpractice when you're outnumbered.<br />\nlyn Marshall and Dwight Plott.<br />\nEven a new formation may not solve the problem, and the Marshall possibly holds a slight<br />\nalso<br />\nsquad may have to resort to the same means of solving their lead.

In one of the first games of the season Mathias fumbled<br />\nfive times and followed this performance the next week with two<br />\nfumbles that set up touchdowns. In a dramatic ceremony the<br />\nthe defensive captain handed the captain of the offensive team a<br />\nbox which was promptly handed to the decatholon champ. Inside<br />\nhe found a football with a handle on it. The results were<br />\namazing. For the next week Mathias had no trouble at all and<br />\ndidn 't fumble once.<br />\nSomething will probably have to be done quickly unless the<br />\nteam is going to meet with disaster. This week the squad will<br />\nonce again take to the road this time headed for HampdenSydney, Virginia. Although the Tigers have lost Clancy Holland,<br />\ncaptain of last year's team and leading ground gainer, the squad<br />\nstill seems to be a strong one, winning their first three out of four<br />\ngames. The most noteworthy of these was a victory over Emory<br />\nand Henry, one of the most powerful small teams in the nation<br />\nlast year and Little Six champs.<br />\nThe game probably will hinge on passing which so far has<br />\nbeen the Jay weakness both offensively and defensively. Two late<br />\npasses scored twice for F&amp;M after the interception of a pass<br />\nstarted the Diplomats drive to their first score. Last week seven<br />\nHopkins passes were intercepted. Hampden-Sydney will field a<br />\nfast veteran pass defense that should give Maestro Bucky Myers a<br />\nlittle trouble although an inexperienced offensive backfield should<br />\nbe the weakest pass offense that the Jays have faced this year.<br />\nIn conclusion, I have these words of Shelby's for all discouraged lacrosse fans. \"If winter comes, can spring be far behind.\"<br /><br />\nCampus capers<br />\ncall for Coke<br />\nEveryone enjoys the break<br />\nbetween classes.
