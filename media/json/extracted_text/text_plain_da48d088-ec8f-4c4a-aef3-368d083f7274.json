Imeediately<br />\nimpressive are his large, dark eyes<br />\nand ingratiating good looks. He<br />\nalso had a very dark suntan<br />\nwhich, by comparision, must<br />\nhave made me resemble Banquo's<br />\nghost.<br />\nThen we were sitting across<br />\nfrom him in leather swivel chairs<br />\nin his office, which was<br />\nsurprisingly devoid of<br />\nmementoes, I noticed. Muller is<br />\nnot one to<br />\n'rain friThirdt<br />\n<br />\nparade<br />\n<br />\nhis<br />\n<br />\nagjr-s.<br />\nirsc<br />\nopened the questioning with a<br />\n<br />\nquery about the planned biology<br />\ncomplex. Muller rejoined<br />\nskillfully. At this point my<br />\nstrategy began to dissolve. The<br />\nnight before I had visions of a<br />\nscathing verbal attack on Muller,<br />\nswipes at the viscera, broadsides<br />\nof unmodulated ferocity, Muller<br />\non his knees pleading for mercy,<br />\nthe President begging for succor.<br />\nIt didn't take me long to realize<br />\nthat we were in the hands of a<br />\ntrue professional.<br />\nThen it was my turn, and I hit<br />\nhim with a snake of a question<br />\nabout admissions, specifically<br />\nwhy the size of the incoming<br />\nfreshman class was so large. In<br />\nresponse, Muller threw his arms<br />\nopen grandly, smiled expansively,<br />\nand said: \"More people accepted<br />\nus. We accepted our usual<br />\nnumber but more accepted us.<br />\nIsn't that wonderful?\" It was<br />\nimpossible to disagree.<br />\nA few more questions, and<br />\nMuller had won us over. Dissent<br />\nwas inconceivable, even when his<br />\nanswers were less than logical.<br />\nWhen he explained that the<br />\ntext by nannin pies ay pos<br />\nand \"Carry On,\" driving the establishment of new faculty<br />\ncrowds into raging ovations. Quite chairs would be delayed \"for our<br />\nan experience, but whether or not benefit,\" I observed silently that<br />\nCSNY (or Bob Dylan, Eric his reasoning resembled that<br />\nClapton, George Harrison et al), employed by the man who used<br />\nfor all their good intentions, can to wear tight shoes because it felt<br />\nsave rock and roll remains to be so good to take them off. But<br />\nMuller is articulate, extremely<br />\nseen.<br />\n<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\n1,atures editor<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editors<br />\nproduction manager<br />\n<br />\nbright, and, when he chooses to<br />\nbe, well-nigh irresistible.<br />\nSoon Muller was in complete<br />\ncontrol, giving us gratuitous bits<br />\nof privileged information, his<br />\nrepartee and informal elegance in<br />\nperfect form. He told us about<br />\nsome new appointments, the<br />\nproblems with the air<br />\nconditioning in his office, and<br />\nthe Biology department and how<br />\nit was the University's largest<br />\nteaching department.<br />\nThen the phone rang. Muller<br />\ndidn't bat an eyelash. \"Just tell<br />\nhim he'll have to wait,\" was the<br />\ndictum.<br />\nThen he continued. He was on<br />\nstage and it was fascinating to<br />\nwatch him in this, his glossy<br />\nmilieu. I actually found myself<br />\nhoping that no contretemp s<br />\nwould develop, that that odious<br />\nsource of embarrassment to all<br />\nHopkins administrators \u2014 the<br />\nissue of course offerings \u2014 would<br />\nnot come up. It seemed a shame<br />\nto upset the performance. But<br />\nHirsch neither asked nor gave any<br />\nquarter, and at about 11:45 the<br />\nsub ject'w as broached.<br />\n<br />\n\"largest teaching department,\"<br />\nborrowing Muller's phrase for<br />\neffect. Muller hesitated<br />\n<br />\nmomentarily, glanced nerv ously<br />\nat Jakie Hall who was sitting<br />\nsome distance away from us<br />\ntaking notes, and gave some<br />\nfacile response. He had conceded<br />\nus the point. Hall wrote<br />\nsomething down. I stared at the<br />\ndistended veins on the President's<br />\nforehead and readied myself for<br />\nattack. Suddenly Muller was a<br />\nwounded gazelle in a pinstripe<br />\nsuit, sweating and squirming like<br />\nthe contorted beasts in Picasso's<br />\nGuemica. I smelled blood and<br />\nmy eyes were focussing on his<br />\njugular while I flipped through the<br />\nfiling cards in my head for<br />\nsuitable subjects: Housing, the<br />\nUnion, Advising, Housing the<br />\nLibrary!<br />\nJust then, Muller remarked<br />\nsotto voce that the interview<br />\nwould have to end. \"I don't.<br />\nknow why this was set up at this<br />\ntime but I have someone<br />\nwaiting,\" he explained.<br />\nBewildered, I looked over to<br />\nJakie who smiled abjectly.<br />\nBut Muller was to have the<br />\nfinal touche. Not by winning an<br />\nargumentative point but, as is his<br />\nway, by making us succumb to<br />\nhis charm. We did so when we<br />\n,left the office and saw just who it<br />\nwas that Muller had kept waiting<br />\nso he could talk to us \u2014 Dean<br />\nSigmund Suskind.<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nMarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br />\n<br />\nLinda Joy<br />\nJay Goodgold, Lainy Stephans<br />\nClayton Mick<br />\nJohn Srygley<br />\nBrian Blitz, JeffPosner<br />\nStephen Levi,,, Robert Rosen wasser<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\n<br />\nstaff writers: Joe Buscema, Louisa Davis, Bob Danner, Sue Eyrich,<br />\nPatrice Gallagher, Jordan Gantz, Leonard Levie, Michael Manes, Stacy<br />\nMonth, Paula Tarnapol, Liz Wallace.<br />\nproduction: Craig Nankin<br />\nifitographers: Gary *Barg, Mike Block, Joachim Munck, Al Casale,<br />\nArna Cohen, Leah Seidenfeld, Joanne Silberner<br />\ntypists: Mark Hylind, Sandy Silberman<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letteriseptember 6, 1974<br />\n<br />\n0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n9,<br />\nThe Office<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\nfin Pm WORD'<br />\n<br />\nthe Chaplain<br />\n<br />\nbegins<br />\n\"The Reel World 1974- 75\"<br />\nwith<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 All films will be screened on Wednesday<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 and Sunday evenings in the Listening and<br />\n\u2022 Viewing Room of the new Student Union<br />\n\u2022 at<br />\n\u2022<br />\n7:30 p.m. Admission is by subscription<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022only!

Collated from editions<br />\nof the Summer News-Letter it<br />\nconcerns those issues which will<br />\nhave impact on the life and<br />\neducation of undergraduates<br />\nadmissions, finances, the<br />\nlibrary and academic policies.<br />\nFund Record<br />\nOfficials of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nFund reported over the summer<br />\nthat this year's annual<br />\nfund-raising campaign was the<br />\nmost successful ever, as alumni of<br />\nthe University pledged<br />\n$2,009,000 to Hopkins in<br />\nresponse to the annual Rollcall.<br />\nThis year's total was an<br />\nincrease of only about $6,000<br />\n<br />\nover last year. However, donor<br />\nparticipation was up substantially<br />\nthis year with 17,147 alumni<br />\ncontributing, as compared to<br />\n15,362 last year. Approximately<br />\n31 per cent of all people solicited<br />\ncontributed, roughly a 12 per<br />\ncent increase in participation<br />\nover last year.<br />\nThe School of Medicine<br />\nreceived the lion's share of the<br />\ndonations, netting nearly<br />\n$610,000. The Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences received $220,000<br />\nand the Evening College garnered<br />\n$12,148.<br />\nRobert Macgill, Vice President<br />\nor the Hopkins Fund, cited<br />\n\"good class agents\" as the main<br />\nreason for Hopkins' steadily<br />\nrisin Rollcall totals. T hp<br />\n<br />\nLarry Denton<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Bento'n<br />\nprincipal thrust behind the<br />\nlarge-scale solicitations are the<br />\nwork of the alumni from the<br />\nvarious classes, Macgill said.<br />\nLast year's Rollcall total,<br />\nthough it marked the first time<br />\nthe two million dollar level had<br />\nbeen surpassed, was not enough<br />\nto keep assed was not enough to<br />\nkeep Hopkins in the Council for<br />\nFinancial Aid to Education's top<br />\nten of alumni giving. Hopkins<br />\ndropped to eleventh in the<br />\ncountry in giving this year after<br />\nsecuring the number ten spot in<br />\nthe Council's listing.<br />\nThe Rollcall has served for 27<br />\nyears as Hopkins' annual method<br />\nfor soliciting contributions.<br />\nMoney collected from the<br />\nHopkins Hundreds campaign,<br />\nwhich is a capital building<br />\nprogram, is in no way related to<br />\n<br />\nthe Rollcall donations.<br />\nBecause the Hundreds<br />\ncampaign has not yet begun to<br />\nsolicite alumni nationally, they<br />\nhave not yet begun to feel the<br />\nsqueeze of the two fund-raising<br />\ndrives, Macgill said.<br />\nMoney from the Rollcall goes<br />\nprimarily towards operating<br />\nexpenses of the various divisions<br />\nof the University, while the<br />\nHundreds campaign monies go<br />\ntowards increases in the<br />\nUniversity endowment and<br />\ncapital improvments.<br />\nAdmissions Head<br />\nAmong numerous<br />\nadministrative changes and<br />\nappointments, Glen A. Thomas,<br />\nformerly the Associate Director<br />\nof Admissigns here, was named<br />\nAdmissions Director in early<br />\nJuly. Thomas replaced John<br />\nRiina, who left Admissions to<br />\nserve as manager of the new<br />\naudio-visual division of the Johns<br />\n<br />\nHopkins University Press.<br />\nAnnouncing the Thomas<br />\nappointment, Homewood Vice<br />\nPresident George Bentcn<br />\ncommented,\"We are fortunate in.<br />\nbeing able to fill this position<br />\nwith a young man of Mr.<br />\nThomas' demonstrated<br />\nadministrative skill and<br />\nfamiliarity with Johns Hopkins.\"<br />\nOver 200 applications were<br />\noriginally submitted for the<br />\nposition, from which six final<br />\ncandidates were selected.

The 1974<br />\nHandpaper did not satisfy this<br />\nneed.\"<br />\nBenton, commenting on the<br />\noutcome of the meeting,<br />\nremarked, \"At the present time,<br />\nDr. Muller doesn't care whether<br />\nthe Dean or the Chaplain is in<br />\ncharge of the publication, but he<br />\nhas made it my responsibility to<br />\nsee that a useful, factual<br />\nHandpaper is produced.\"<br />\nComplaints centered around<br />\nthe newspaper format of the<br />\nPublication, a change from last<br />\nyear's book form. Benton found<br />\nthe publication \"amusing and<br />\nvvell-done\" but felt it \"did not<br /><br />\nprovide enough facts for new<br />\nstudents.\" Other .administrators<br />\nreportedly labeled the Handpaper<br />\n\"awkward to carry.\"<br />\nWickwire, however, said his<br />\noffice had received a good<br /><br />\nChester Wickwire<br /><br />\nthat his office would retain<br />\ncontrol. \"I enjoy working with<br />\nstudents, and the Handpaper is<br />\ngood exposure for our office's<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\n\"If the Handvaver is turned<br /><br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick<br /><br />\nover to our office,\" said Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick, Dean of Students,\"I<br />\nwill not write it myself, but will<br />\nturn it over to a student editorial<br />\nboard and tell them to present<br />\nthe facts.\"<br />\n\"This year's Handpaper is<br />\nhumorous, but there is always<br />\nthe danger that the humor will<br />\nonly be understandable to those<br />\nwho have already been at<br />\nHopkins. We would want to<br />\nmake the publication helpful to<br />\noutsiders and new students.\"<br />\nBenton's attitude towards next<br />\nyear's publication was more<br />\nspecific, however. \"In preparing<br />\nnext year's publication, I will<br />\nrequire assurance that one of<br />\nthree alternatives is adhered to.<br />\nEither the Handpaper will remain<br />\nthe same but include a factual<br />\ninsert prepared by the University,<br />\nkeep the jazzy Handpaper and let<br />\nthe Dean of Students Office<br />\npublish a dry reference book on<br />\nUniversity facts, or go back to<br />\nlast year's style of Handbook.\"<br /><br />\nStudent Health Insurance Program revised<br />\nBy BOB DANNER<br />\nHopkins has revamped its<br />\nStudent Health Insurance<br />\nProgram this year so that<br />\nstudents will receive diagnostic<br />\nand major medical benefits from<br />\nMaryland Blue Cross and Blue<br />\nShield, which replaces Mutual of<br />\nOmaha, a private insurance<br />\ncompany that held the account<br />\nlast year.<br />\nThe new program provides<br />\nbetter coverage than last year's<br />\nbut is nearly twice as expensive.<br />\nStudents are required to buy<br /><br />\nHopkins hires new<br />\nfaculty members<br />\nIn this past year's hiring of<br />\nnew faculty, Hopkins found itself<br />\nin the enviable position of<br />\nengaging nearly all of the people<br />\nIt approached, according to Dr<br />\nGeorge Owen, Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nConsequently,\" Hopkins was<br />\nmore successful than in previous<br />\nYears in luring scholars from<br />\nthroughout the country to join<br />\nits faculty.<br />\n\"The first nine people that we<br />\nmade offers to, accepted,\"<br />\nex plained Owen. \"All, of them<br />\nWere top people.\"<br />\nAmong one of the major<br />\nr<br />\necruiting goals of the University<br />\nwas to diversify the faculty with<br />\n\"nien,Owen revealed.<br />\n\"There has been a big attempt<br />\nto hire more women,\" Owen<br />\nstated.

Only foreign students<br />\nwere required by the University<br />\nto buy membership in last year's<br />\nprogram.<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick, Dean of<br />\nStudents, cited one reason for<br />\nthe termination of optional<br />\nhealth care protection: \"When<br />\nstudents without insurance need<br />\nhospital care, the University is<br />\nobligated to sign for them and<br />\nstands responsible.\"<br />\n\"Now, students, their parents,<br />\nand the University are fully<br />\nprotected,\" he continued.<br />\nDr. Torrey Brown, Director of<br />\nthe Student Health Service,<br />\nendorsed the new plan because<br />\n\"if all students are required to<br />\nhave a certain, well-defined<br />\namount of coverage, the<br />\nuniversity will know to what<br /><br />\nextent. it must compensate to<br />\nmembers a table for assessment<br />\nprovide for their health care.\"<br />\nof additional services that may be<br />\nEdward Northrup, .needed such as consultant care,<br />\nadministrator of the Health<br />\nlaboratory and x-ray provision,<br />\nServices was also in favor of the<br />\nand psychiatric care.

It is directly resultant from the nature of what Hopkins<br />\noffers and the type of students it attracts.<br />\nThe Commit tee on Undergraduate Studies (GUS),<br />\nhowever, has elected to take a giant step backwards with the<br />\ninstitution of a Dean's List to provide pats on the little<br />\npointed heads of those good boys and girls who get a 3.5 or<br />\nabove. Acting with what has become a characteristic<br />\ntendency towards secrecy, the GUS has also challenged the<br />\nfounding tenets of this, the first true American university - a<br />\ndedication to individualism, and a reverence for scholarship.<br />\n(Scholarship? Isn't that the thing that was supposed to be its<br />\nown reward?)<br />\nAcademic Counselor Martha Roseman thinks its \"a nice<br />\nthing.\" We think its a stupid, worthless, self-indulgent frill<br />\nwhich will serve only to increase the unhealthy, excessively<br />\nkeen competition which pervades the undergraduate program<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nDeaii of Academic Programs, Sigmund Suskind, thinks it<br />\nwill make us -\"one division.\" Yes, one big sinking division,<br />\nstinking of rivalry, and mote pressure-ridden than ever, due,<br />\nin no small part, to the myopic perceptions of the GUS, a<br />\npanel which apparently thinks the best way to clean one's<br />\nsuit is to jump into a mud bog.<br /><br />\nAs the News-Letter moves into its 79th year of publication<br />\nwith this issue, we thought it appropriate to pause for a<br />\nmoment and talk about the News-Letter, and its role on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe News-Letter is an undergraduate publication written<br />\nprimarily for undergraduates.

It is hard to imagine a<br />\nman more completely in<br />\npossession of these requisite<br />\nattributes, more eminently<br />\nqualified for the job than Johns<br />\nHopkins' own Steven Muller.<br />\nAlthough it may pain some to<br />\nadmit it, he is, by all accounts,<br />\nvery, very good at his work.<br />\nMuller's route to the Hopkins'<br />\nPresidency was, in a word,<br />\ncircuitous. There were his<br />\ndays at UCLA. a<br />\nRhode%Scho\u2018ats..\\11 , stint 1-v *le<br /><br />\nire/ore-el-<br /><br />\nAdd Crosby, Stills, Nash and<br />\nYoung to the list of rock and roll<br />\nreunions, revivals and comebacks<br />\nthat have been so much the vogue<br />\nthis year. The band is just ending<br />\nup a 30-odd date tour there marks<br />\nan absence of four years.<br />\nAccording to David Crosby, the<br />\nmain reason for the group's<br />\nreconciliation was much the same<br />\nas that offered by Bob Dylan for<br />\nhis return to the concert route<br />\nearlier in the year: to fill a void in<br />\nthe ever-darkening rock and roll<br />\nscene. CSNY also stand to gross<br />\naround S10 million with upwards<br />\nof a million persons paying an<br />\naverage ticket price of S8.50 to see<br />\nthe show.<br />\nCrosby, Stills and Nash got<br />\ntogether in early 1969, after<br />\nleaving their respective groups<br />\n(Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and<br />\nHollies), in order to record an<br />\nalbum of music, the influence of<br />\nwhich is still being felt today.<br />\nCombining rare talents of vocal<br />\nharmonizing and Stills' prodigious<br />\nstudio abilities, the trio set the<br />\ncourse for the mellow, wooden<br />\nrock of the Seventies. The next<br />\nyear they were joined by Stills' old<br />\nfoil from the Springfield days, Neil<br />\nYoung. Deja Vu, the album<br /><br />\nproduced by the new foursome,<br />\nwas even more successful<br />\ncommerically than the previous<br />\neffort. The group went on tour<br />\nthat summer and then split up.<br />\nCSNY played three sold-out<br />\nshows at the Capital Centre in<br />\nLargo late last month, and sent the<br />\nhungry crowds away satisfied.<br />\nAveraging four hours each, their<br />\nperformances were structured such<br />\nthat the group in toto played an<br />\nopening set, followed by solo sets<br />\n(more or less) from each member,<br />\nand, reassembled, closing with an<br />\nextended set. The harmonies were<br />\ngenerally strong and clear, the<br />\nmusicianship tight. Backed by Tim<br />\nDrummond on bass, Russ Kunkel<br />\non drums and Joe Lala on<br />\npercussion, CSNY performed<br />\nmostly their old favorites, but did<br />\ntake advantage of favorable<br />\naudience reaction to introduce<br />\nsome new numbers. Among the<br />\noldies were \"Love the One you're<br />\nWith,\"\"Wooden Ships,\" \"Almost<br />\nCut My Hair' and Pre-toad<br />\nDowns.\" Crosby was ebullient<br />\nthroughout, shining especially on<br />\n\"Carry Me\" (a new tune) and<br />\n\"Deja Vu.\" Graham Nash's gentle<br />\nEnglish presence and lilting tenor<br />\nmade him an easy favorite of the<br /><br />\nbecame the Hopkins Provost and<br />\neventually President.<br />\nThe years since Muller's<br />\naccession to the kingpin slot have<br />\nbeen good ones. The sumptuous<br />\nnew student union has been<br />\ncompleted, a new department<br />\n(Anthropology) has been<br />\nestablished, a new Humanities<br />\nhonors program has been<br />\ninitiated, an Advisor in the Arts,<br />\nEugene W. Leake, has been<br />\nappointed, and the role of the<br />\nstudent in the administration's<br />\npolicymaking has been enhanced.<br />\nYet, there has been another<br />\nchange of far greater importance.<br />\nSo great that undergraduates<br />\nhave difficulty recognizing its<br />\npreeminence. The fact is that<br />\nHopkins is in the black, the<br />\nbooks are balancing at a time<br />\nwhen other private institutions<br />\nacross the land are hobbling<br />\nthrough each fiscal year in<br />\npenury. This man Muller can<br />\nraise money, truckloads of the<br />\nstuff. It's a sign of the times that<br />\nhe is considered a good university<br />\npresident in some circles for that<br />\nreason alone.<br /><br />\ne nave no chofre 7<br /><br />\ncrowa. tiis voice was st,rmy ana<br />\ndemanding on \"Immigration Man\";<br />\nguileless and endearing on \"Our<br />\nHouse.\" Stephen Stills slashed<br />\nthrough \"Word Game\" and his<br />\ngenius for rearranging old material<br />\nwas witnessed most profoundly on<br />\nthe epic \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.\"<br />\nOnly Neil Young failed to reach<br /><br />\ninc par ot the others, suffering<br />\nfrom inept guitar work, off-key<br />\nvocals and asthmatic harmonica<br />\nplaying. His \"Only Love Can Break<br />\nYour Heart\" was snatched from<br />\nthe fire by some stunning acapella<br />\nvocals from the other three.<br />\nThe shows were wrapped _up<br />\nwith frenetic renditions of \"Ohio\"<br /><br />\nreasons; to establish a working<br />\nrelationship with the highest of<br />\nthe potentates, to get somejuicy<br />\ntips to pursue, and to get a sniff<br />\nof what he is really like, to see if<br />\nmaybe there wasn't something<br />\nbogus deep down behind that<br />\ncultivated facade which could be<br />\nferreted out, inflated to scandal<br />\nproportions, and spread across<br />\nthe front page of our tabloid in<br />\nscare headlines!<br />\nMuller's friendly assistant,<br />\nJakie Hall, was quick to<br />\naccomodate us and scheduled a<br />\nmeeting for us with Muller to<br />\nbegin at 11:15 one July morning.<br />\nHirsch and I showed up<br />\nsimultaneously in the lobby of<br />\nGarland Hall about 20 minutes<br />\nearly, he sweating profusely, I<br />\nnervously tearing to shreds the<br />\nBaltimore Sun I had brought to<br />\nread while we waited. Out the<br />\nwindow went equanimity as we<br />\nanxiously huddled together to<br />\nplan our questioning strategy.<br />\nJust as Hirsch vetoed my<br />\nsuggestion that we assail Muller<br />\non the subject of undergraduate<br />\nhousing, I noticed that he was<br /><br />\n\"That's bush.\"<br />\nCertainly there was no place<br />\nfor something as vulgar as a<br />\nreporter's notebook in the<br />\npresence of the august company<br />\nwe were about to visit. Hirsch<br />\ncomplied and tossed the book in<br />\nan appropriate receptacle. He had<br />\na reprimand of his own, though,<br />\nconcerning my impetuosity.<br />\n\"Just watch your big mouth<br />\nfor once,\" he pleaded. \"Be<br />\npolite, huh?\"<br />\n\"Insofar as<br />\nconceded.<br />\nThen at precisely 1 1:15, there<br />\nwas Muller's appearance,<br />\nfollowed by a long, almost<br />\nawe-struck silence. Imeediately<br />\nimpressive are his large, dark eyes<br />\nand ingratiating good looks. He<br />\nalso had a very dark suntan<br />\nwhich, by comparision, must<br />\nhave made me resemble Banquo's<br />\nghost.<br />\nThen we were sitting across<br />\nfrom him in leather swivel chairs<br />\nin his office, which was<br />\nsurprisingly devoid of<br />\nmementoes, I noticed. Muller is<br />\nnot one to<br />\n'rain friThirdt<br /><br />\nparade<br /><br />\nhis<br /><br />\nagjr-s.<br />\nirsc<br />\nopened the questioning with a<br /><br />\nquery about the planned biology<br />\ncomplex. Muller rejoined<br />\nskillfully. At this point my<br />\nstrategy began to dissolve. The<br />\nnight before I had visions of a<br />\nscathing verbal attack on Muller,<br />\nswipes at the viscera, broadsides<br />\nof unmodulated ferocity, Muller<br />\non his knees pleading for mercy,<br />\nthe President begging for succor.<br />\nIt didn't take me long to realize<br />\nthat we were in the hands of a<br />\ntrue professional.<br />\nThen it was my turn, and I hit<br />\nhim with a snake of a question<br />\nabout admissions, specifically<br />\nwhy the size of the incoming<br />\nfreshman class was so large. In<br />\nresponse, Muller threw his arms<br />\nopen grandly, smiled expansively,<br />\nand said: \"More people accepted<br />\nus. We accepted our usual<br />\nnumber but more accepted us.<br />\nIsn't that wonderful?\" It was<br />\nimpossible to disagree.<br />\nA few more questions, and<br />\nMuller had won us over. Dissent<br />\nwas inconceivable, even when his<br />\nanswers were less than logical.<br />\nWhen he explained that the<br />\ntext by nannin pies ay pos<br />\nand \"Carry On,\" driving the establishment of new faculty<br />\ncrowds into raging ovations. Quite chairs would be delayed \"for our<br />\nan experience, but whether or not benefit,\" I observed silently that<br />\nCSNY (or Bob Dylan, Eric his reasoning resembled that<br />\nClapton, George Harrison et al), employed by the man who used<br />\nfor all their good intentions, can to wear tight shoes because it felt<br />\nsave rock and roll remains to be so good to take them off. But<br />\nMuller is articulate, extremely<br />\nseen.<br /><br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\n1,atures editor<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editors<br />\nproduction manager<br /><br />\nbright, and, when he chooses to<br />\nbe, well-nigh irresistible.<br />\nSoon Muller was in complete<br />\ncontrol, giving us gratuitous bits<br />\nof privileged information, his<br />\nrepartee and informal elegance in<br />\nperfect form. He told us about<br />\nsome new appointments, the<br />\nproblems with the air<br />\nconditioning in his office, and<br />\nthe Biology department and how<br />\nit was the University's largest<br />\nteaching department.<br />\nThen the phone rang. Muller<br />\ndidn't bat an eyelash. \"Just tell<br />\nhim he'll have to wait,\" was the<br />\ndictum.<br />\nThen he continued. He was on<br />\nstage and it was fascinating to<br />\nwatch him in this, his glossy<br />\nmilieu. I actually found myself<br />\nhoping that no contretemp s<br />\nwould develop, that that odious<br />\nsource of embarrassment to all<br />\nHopkins administrators \u2014 the<br />\nissue of course offerings \u2014 would<br />\nnot come up. It seemed a shame<br />\nto upset the performance. But<br />\nHirsch neither asked nor gave any<br />\nquarter, and at about 11:45 the<br />\nsub ject'w as broached.<br /><br />\n\"largest teaching department,\"<br />\nborrowing Muller's phrase for<br />\neffect. Muller hesitated<br /><br />\nmomentarily, glanced nerv ously<br />\nat Jakie Hall who was sitting<br />\nsome distance away from us<br />\ntaking notes, and gave some<br />\nfacile response. He had conceded<br />\nus the point. Hall wrote<br />\nsomething down. I stared at the<br />\ndistended veins on the President's<br />\nforehead and readied myself for<br />\nattack. Suddenly Muller was a<br />\nwounded gazelle in a pinstripe<br />\nsuit, sweating and squirming like<br />\nthe contorted beasts in Picasso's<br />\nGuemica. I smelled blood and<br />\nmy eyes were focussing on his<br />\njugular while I flipped through the<br />\nfiling cards in my head for<br />\nsuitable subjects: Housing, the<br />\nUnion, Advising, Housing the<br />\nLibrary!<br />\nJust then, Muller remarked<br />\nsotto voce that the interview<br />\nwould have to end. \"I don't.<br />\nknow why this was set up at this<br />\ntime but I have someone<br />\nwaiting,\" he explained.<br />\nBewildered, I looked over to<br />\nJakie who smiled abjectly.<br />\nBut Muller was to have the<br />\nfinal touche. Not by winning an<br />\nargumentative point but, as is his<br />\nway, by making us succumb to<br />\nhis charm. We did so when we<br />\n,left the office and saw just who it<br />\nwas that Muller had kept waiting<br />\nso he could talk to us \u2014 Dean<br />\nSigmund Suskind.<br /><br />\n_<br />\nMarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br /><br />\nLinda Joy<br />\nJay Goodgold, Lainy Stephans<br />\nClayton Mick<br />\nJohn Srygley<br />\nBrian Blitz, JeffPosner<br />\nStephen Levi,,, Robert Rosen wasser<br />\nDante Landucci<br /><br />\nstaff writers: Joe Buscema, Louisa Davis, Bob Danner, Sue Eyrich,<br />\nPatrice Gallagher, Jordan Gantz, Leonard Levie, Michael Manes, Stacy<br />\nMonth, Paula Tarnapol, Liz Wallace.<br />\nproduction: Craig Nankin<br />\nifitographers: Gary *Barg, Mike Block, Joachim Munck, Al Casale,<br />\nArna Cohen, Leah Seidenfeld, Joanne Silberner<br />\ntypists: Mark Hylind, Sandy Silberman<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letteriseptember 6, 1974<br /><br />\n0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n9,<br />\nThe Office<br />\nof<br /><br />\nfin Pm WORD'<br /><br />\nthe Chaplain<br /><br />\nbegins<br />\n\"The Reel World 1974- 75\"<br />\nwith<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 All films will be screened on Wednesday<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 and Sunday evenings in the Listening and<br />\n\u2022 Viewing Room of the new Student Union<br />\n\u2022 at<br />\n\u2022<br />\n7:30 p.m. Admission is by subscription<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022only!

Collated from editions<br />\nof the Summer News-Letter it<br />\nconcerns those issues which will<br />\nhave impact on the life and<br />\neducation of undergraduates<br />\nadmissions, finances, the<br />\nlibrary and academic policies.<br />\nFund Record<br />\nOfficials of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nFund reported over the summer<br />\nthat this year's annual<br />\nfund-raising campaign was the<br />\nmost successful ever, as alumni of<br />\nthe University pledged<br />\n$2,009,000 to Hopkins in<br />\nresponse to the annual Rollcall.<br />\nThis year's total was an<br />\nincrease of only about $6,000<br /><br />\nover last year. However, donor<br />\nparticipation was up substantially<br />\nthis year with 17,147 alumni<br />\ncontributing, as compared to<br />\n15,362 last year. Approximately<br />\n31 per cent of all people solicited<br />\ncontributed, roughly a 12 per<br />\ncent increase in participation<br />\nover last year.<br />\nThe School of Medicine<br />\nreceived the lion's share of the<br />\ndonations, netting nearly<br />\n$610,000. The Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences received $220,000<br />\nand the Evening College garnered<br />\n$12,148.<br />\nRobert Macgill, Vice President<br />\nor the Hopkins Fund, cited<br />\n\"good class agents\" as the main<br />\nreason for Hopkins' steadily<br />\nrisin Rollcall totals. T hp<br /><br />\nLarry Denton<br /><br />\nGeorge Bento'n<br />\nprincipal thrust behind the<br />\nlarge-scale solicitations are the<br />\nwork of the alumni from the<br />\nvarious classes, Macgill said.<br />\nLast year's Rollcall total,<br />\nthough it marked the first time<br />\nthe two million dollar level had<br />\nbeen surpassed, was not enough<br />\nto keep assed was not enough to<br />\nkeep Hopkins in the Council for<br />\nFinancial Aid to Education's top<br />\nten of alumni giving. Hopkins<br />\ndropped to eleventh in the<br />\ncountry in giving this year after<br />\nsecuring the number ten spot in<br />\nthe Council's listing.<br />\nThe Rollcall has served for 27<br />\nyears as Hopkins' annual method<br />\nfor soliciting contributions.<br />\nMoney collected from the<br />\nHopkins Hundreds campaign,<br />\nwhich is a capital building<br />\nprogram, is in no way related to<br /><br />\nthe Rollcall donations.<br />\nBecause the Hundreds<br />\ncampaign has not yet begun to<br />\nsolicite alumni nationally, they<br />\nhave not yet begun to feel the<br />\nsqueeze of the two fund-raising<br />\ndrives, Macgill said.<br />\nMoney from the Rollcall goes<br />\nprimarily towards operating<br />\nexpenses of the various divisions<br />\nof the University, while the<br />\nHundreds campaign monies go<br />\ntowards increases in the<br />\nUniversity endowment and<br />\ncapital improvments.<br />\nAdmissions Head<br />\nAmong numerous<br />\nadministrative changes and<br />\nappointments, Glen A. Thomas,<br />\nformerly the Associate Director<br />\nof Admissigns here, was named<br />\nAdmissions Director in early<br />\nJuly. Thomas replaced John<br />\nRiina, who left Admissions to<br />\nserve as manager of the new<br />\naudio-visual division of the Johns<br /><br />\nHopkins University Press.<br />\nAnnouncing the Thomas<br />\nappointment, Homewood Vice<br />\nPresident George Bentcn<br />\ncommented,\"We are fortunate in.<br />\nbeing able to fill this position<br />\nwith a young man of Mr.<br />\nThomas' demonstrated<br />\nadministrative skill and<br />\nfamiliarity with Johns Hopkins.\"<br />\nOver 200 applications were<br />\noriginally submitted for the<br />\nposition, from which six final<br />\ncandidates were selected. The<br />\ninformal committee to choose<br />\nthe new admissions chief<br />\nincluded Benton, newly<br />\nappointed Academic Services<br />\nhead Larry Denton, the<br />\nAdmissions staff acting as an ad<br />\nhoc group, and several students<br />\nserving as consultants.<br />\nThomas has worked in the<br />\nAdmissions Office for six years.<br />\nsee SUMMER ',age 4<br /><br />\n.02<br /><br />\nMSE Library<br /><br />\nall 23H.
