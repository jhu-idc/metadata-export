Usually, the Budget<br />\nCommittee has submitted a<br />\ngreater hike than the one<br />\nadopted.<br />\nAccording to University<br />\nPresident Dr. Steven Muller, this<br />\nagreement does not necessarily<br />\nset a precedent. In the past,<br />\nMuller said, the recommended<br />\nfigures have been based on<br />\nprinciple and were too vague, or<br />\nthey were unacceptably high.<br />\nAccording to Professor of<br />\nPolitical Honomy Dr. Bela<br />\nBalassa, who chairs the Faculty<br />\nBudget Committee, the tuition<br />\nincreases had been falling behind<br />\nthose of ther schools. This affects<br />\nthe size of the faculty, he said.<br />\nThough next year's $4500<br />\ntuition bill is 11% above this<br />\nyear's $4050, the net rise in<br />\nrevenues is only 3% because of<br />\nthe projected 8% jump in the<br />\ncost of living. had tuition only<br />\nrisen at the same rate as inflation,<br />\nnext year's hike would have been<br />\n$324, $126 less than the actual<br />\n<br />\nOCTOBER 20,1978<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\n<br />\nincrease.<br />\nThis difference will free<br />\nenough money to stave off<br />\napproximately 7-8 faculty cuts,<br />\nBalassa said. He obtained this<br />\nfigure by multiplying 2200, the<br />\ncont. on p. 8<br />\n<br />\nBudget and personnel<br />\nreductions in the Central<br />\nAdministration of the University<br />\nare currently being studied by a<br />\ntask force headed by Budget<br />\nDirector Norman Krueger. The<br />\nstudy will be completed by the<br />\nend of October, when<br />\npreparation of next year's budget<br />\nwill begin.<br />\nApproximately one year ago,<br />\nPresident Muller informed<br />\nadministration colleagues of the<br />\nneed to hold the administration<br />\nbudget at last year's level. This<br />\naction will cut the budget by 8%<br />\nin real terms. To effect this<br />\nreduction, Krueger's committee<br />\nwas formed.<br />\nThe committee has spent the<br />\nlast three months reviewing the<br />\nbudgets and needs of the various<br />\nareas within Central<br />\nAdministration (purchasing,<br />\nadministrative services,personnel).<br />\nDuring that period, the<br />\ncommittee met on thirty-two<br />\noccasions.<br />\nNow that the review is<br />\ncompleted, the committee must<br />\nevaluate the information it has<br />\nreceived to determine what areas<br />\ncan be cut back and what areas<br />\nshould be augmented.

He must<br />\n<br />\nbe permitted to present his views, whether in the context<br />\nthey were presented last May or any other. Many would<br />\ndeny this, and their attitude is no more enlightened than<br />\n16th century peasants who condoned the burning of<br />\nheretics. But Dr. Pfeffer's views need no repression -- they<br />\nare quite capable of falling on their own merits. They are an<br />\nintellectual crock.<br />\nDr. Pfeffer grandiloquently titles his speech<br />\n\"Appearances and Reality.\" Fine. isn't the reality that<br />\ndespite all the junk food and chemical preservatives our<br />\ncapitalist society supposedly forces us to ingest, people in<br />\nthe Western world today live the longest, healthiest lives in<br />\nhuman history? Being so close to reality, doesn't Dr. Pfeffer<br />\nknow that in Belgium, no such additives of any kind are<br />\nallowed? Can he produce evidence to show that Belgians are<br />\nhappier or healthier than other Europeans? Even more to<br />\nthe point of his speech, will he try to persuade us that<br />\nBelgium is a less capitalist country than France or Holland?<br />\nUniversities Dr. Pfeffer accuses of repression and of<br />\nrefusal to teach the truth. But isn't it true that societies of<br />\npeople everywhere and at all times are extremely<br />\nnarrow-minded and intolerant of dissent? Aren't so-called<br />\nnon-capitalist countries like the Soviet Union much more<br />\nstifling of free discussion than the United States? And aren't<br />\nuniversities the one place in this country where a man with<br />\nviews as wild and patently implausible as Dr. Pfeffer's can<br />\nnot only be heard, but can get paid for voicing them?<br />\nThe reason Marxist doctrine is so offensive to many<br />\npeople who think is because it is precisely that, a rigid and<br />\ndeterministic dogma. Karl Marx was an intelligent and<br />\ninsightful thinker, but so were Aristotle and Max Weber, to<br />\nname just two.

If the Justice<br />\nDepartment at times appears to<br />\nseriously enforce anti-trust<br />\nlegislation, the reality of<br />\nenforcement proceedings<br />\nconfirms in practice the<br />\ntranscendence of our society's<br />\ncommitment to big business. In,<br />\nfor example, the seemingly<br />\nhistoric, still pending, case<br />\nagainst IBM, which was launched<br />\nduring the Johnson<br />\nAdministration, a decision is<br />\nexpected sometime in the<br />\nmid -1980's By that time,<br />\naccording to reliable, quoted<br />\nsources, it is expected that IBM<br />\nwill have realigned its divisions<br />\nalong the lines of General Motors<br />\nso as to make the government's<br />\nproposed remedy irrelevant.<br />\nThe divergence of appearance<br />\nfrom reality is not limited, of<br />\ncourse, to these realms. It<br />\n<br />\ninfiltrates every aspect of our<br />\nlives. It includes the production,<br />\ndistribution and consumption of<br />\nwhat we think. What then of the<br />\nrole of social science in<br />\npenetrating reality? And, yes,<br />\nwhat of the role of the<br />\nuniversity?<br />\n!he place to begin to answer<br />\nthis question is with the<br />\nde-sanctification of the university<br />\nand of its professors. These halls<br />\nand those who reside on them<br />\nshould not be hallowed.<br />\nUniversities in the most basic<br />\nsense are like all other<br />\ninstitutions in our society, and<br />\nprofessors, likewise, like other<br />\nprofessionals.

And, on<br />\nthe whole, universities and social<br />\nscientists do not bite the hands<br />\nthat feed them. The production<br />\nof knowledge,like productions on<br />\nAmerican TV, is inextricably<br />\nlinked to capitalist production<br />\nand capitalist rule.<br />\nThis is hardly unusual. The<br />\nrealities of power and authority<br />\nin every society have decisively<br />\nshaped what is presumed to be<br />\ntrue, what can be recognized and<br />\ntolerated as true, and what truths<br />\nwill be held most dear. These<br />\npower realities shape social<br />\nscience in the U.S. into what it<br />\npredominantly is: fragmented,<br />\nover-specialized, jargonized fields<br />\nof thought, constructed on liberal<br />\nand capitalist assumptions about<br />\nthe nature of human beings and<br />\nthe nature of the world.<br />\nEstablished social scienc_.<br />\ntherefore, is never neutral.<br />\nBut it is not merely cyri.cal<br />\nself-interest that explains why<br />\nour social scientists do not help<br />\nus to understand the truth about<br />\nour society and our lives. Social<br />\nscientists, too, are creatures of<br />\nthe daily lives they lead - of the<br />\nsocialization, pre-professional<br />\nand professional, they have<br />\nundergone in eapitalist America.<br />\nThey too are confounded by<br />\nappearances. Their consciousness,<br />\ntoo, is bounded by the limits of<br />\ntheir daily experience. And, for<br />\nthe most part, the daily lives of<br />\nour professors and other social<br />\nscientists are strikingly isolated<br />\nfrom the daily lives of the<br />\nmajority of our people - those<br />\nwho toil in unrewarding, blueand lower white-collar jobs,<br />\ntrying simply to get through the<br />\nday with some dignity. If<br />\nprofessors lived and worked like<br />\nfactory workers, they might<br />\nthink and write differently. But<br />\ntheir worlds are systematically<br />\ndivided, if invisibly inter-related;<br />\nso what passes for social science<br />\ntoo rarely penetrates to the<br />\nessence of our people's reality.<br />\nOnce we surrender the<br />\nprotective sense of our own<br />\nuniqueness, we can apply a<br />\nuniversal truth to our own<br />\ninstitutions: throughout history<br />\nthe dominant institutions in<br />\nevery society, whatever their<br />\nclaims to the contrary, have more<br />\nor less reinforced the existing,<br />\nlimited social consciousness and<br />\nthe accompanying<br />\nmisperceptions of social reality.<br />\nWhether done in the name of a<br />\nhigh priest, or in the name of a<br />\n<br />\nfull professor, institutionally<br />\nrevealed truths typically are<br />\nconfining, misleading, and<br />\nself-serving.<br />\nThe sad fact, then, is that our<br />\nmajor universities and our social<br />\nsciences, with all the endless<br />\ninformation they spew forth<br />\nabout our social reality, do not<br />\nhelp us much in understanding<br />\nwhy our lives are the way they<br />\nare, or what we must do to<br />\nchange them for the better.<br />\nFortunately, since we all live<br />\nin the concrete, material reality<br />\nof our own daily lives, a myriad<br />\nof unexceptional events impinge<br />\nupon our inherited consciousness<br />\nand confront the sophisticated<br />\npropaganda that everywhere<br />\nsurrounds us. Our daily lives<br />\nthreaten us with a provocative<br />\nconfusion - an inability to<br />\nunderstand why what is<br />\nhappening to us is happening.<br />\nI I \u2022 \u201e! \u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nM<br />\n<br />\nFriday, Slav 24, 1971t<br />\n<br />\nHeckled by parents<br />\n<br />\n- Pfeffer offers parting shot<br />\nM %ILIUM AALGANIZ<br />\n<br />\nTo occasional heckling from the parent<br />\nseetion Rici.ard l'feffer, a political scion.<br />\nlist who has been denied tenure, attacked<br />\ntire capitalist system yesterday at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University's undergraduate<br />\ndiploma ceremony<br />\n<br />\nserve those with wealth and power,\" he<br />\nsaid<br />\nAbout halfway through the speech,<br />\nsomeone called out. \"Get down off your<br />\nsoap box,\" When Dr. Pfeffer described<br />\ncommencements as \"empty rituals.\"<br />\nsomeone shouted.'That's not true\" For a<br />\n<br />\nMany, if not most of us, sense<br />\nthrough our own lives, that<br />\nsomething is terribly wrong in<br />\nour society.

The mass (granted that<br />\n\"masses\" are not too educated)<br />\nof \"revolutionaires\" in the<br />\nSixties were highly educated people,<br />\nwho wished to avoid the Vietnam<br />\nwar, the dominance of their parents,,<br />\nwho had a desire to change the<br />\nof higher<br />\nelite<br />\nstructure<br />\neducation, among other things.<br />\nSurely Mr. Arcure is not thinking<br />\nof the student disturbances in<br />\nCornell and Berkelely as an<br />\nexample of how the \"uneducated<br />\nentered the decision-making<br />\nprocess\" in higher education?<br />\nTo point out all the errors in Mr.<br />\nArcure's essay is a task that<br />\nwould require an essay as big as<br />\nhis. Since Mr. Arcure wishes to<br />\nbe precise and accurate, one may<br />\npoint out that a Classical<br />\nEducation did not consist of<br />\n\"History, Philosophy, Languages,<br />\nLiterature, Mathematics, Science<br />\nand Art,\" as Mr. Arcure seems to<br />\nthink. A classical education<br />\nconsisted of the Seven Liberal<br />\nArts (Arts of Language and<br />\nNumber), which were Grammar,<br />\nRhetoric, Logic, Arithmatic<br />\nand<br />\nGeometry,<br />\nMusic,<br />\nAstronomy. Science and Art in<br />\nthemselves encompass every<br />\nsubject in the Humanities, Social<br />\nSciences, Natural Sciences, and<br />\nQuantitative<br />\nSciences.<br />\nIn<br />\naddition to the Seven Liberal<br />\nArts students were required to<br />\ntake Latin and Greek (and<br />\nsometimes theology).<br />\nAs Mr. Arcure himself says,<br />\n\"what need is there to defend as<br />\nlarge<br />\nand<br />\nan<br />\nprestigious<br />\ninstitution as Johns Hopkins?\"<br />\nMr. Arcure condemns those<br />\ncritics who are prejudiced and<br />\npresent as unrealistic picture of<br />\nthe state of higher education in<br />\nwith<br />\nAmerica,<br />\nespecially<br />\nreference to Johns Hopkins. Yet,<br />\nMr. Arcure himself sounds and<br />\nbehaves like one of those critics.<br />\nNeedless to say, one can do<br />\nwithout emotional outbursts,<br />\nsuch as Mr. Arcure's essay, in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\n<br />\n13,1978 included an editorial<br />\nwhich criticized the \"indolent<br />\nknaves\" of the Student Council<br />\nfor not meeting for two weeks.<br />\nPlease be informed that:<br />\n1)The S.C. did not met on<br />\nOctober 4, 1978 due to the<br />\nCareer Advising Week activites of<br />\nthe evening.<br />\n2) The S.C. postponed its<br />\nOctober 11 meeting (rescheduled<br />\nfor October 16) in respect for<br />\nthose Jewish Council members<br />\nwho were observing the Jewish<br />\nHigh Holy day of Yom Kippur.<br />\nThank-you<br />\nMonroe Zeffert<br />\nSenior Class President<br />\nTo the Editor and Mr. Wile:<br />\nSorry Dan, your comments on<br />\nthe Chaplain's office hold<br />\nabsolutely no water this time. An<br />\n<br />\necumenical religious institution'<br />\nsuch as the Chaplain's office<br />\nfinds that it can best serve the<br />\nspiritual needs of its constituency<br />\nby addressing pressing and<br />\nclear-cut moral issues that should<br />\nbe of interest to all people,<br />\nreligious or non-religious, who<br />\nexpress concern for their fellow<br />\nman. Sincere concern requires<br />\nactivity. One of the primary<br />\nactivities of the Chaplain's office<br />\nis to provide sources of<br />\ninformation and various<br />\nalternative views on issues<br />\nconcerning human rights. Not<br />\nsurprisingly, a special effort is<br />\nmade to provide a platform for<br />\nthe victims of persecution or<br />\nrepression whose views, for<br />\nwhatever reason, are distorted or<br />\nnot heard in the commercial<br />\nmedia.

Wearing my best blue jeans and my<br />\ncrummiest Johns Hopkins University t-shirt, I walked<br />\ndown a leaf-strewn avenue when suddenly I was<br />\napproached by a man resembling Quasimodo. That is, he<br />\nwas hunched over in apparent pain. His facial features<br />\nwere only mildly twisted, and his hair was, for the most<br />\npart, combed. Not a bad-looking fellow actually. Sort of<br />\nreminded me of Derwood Kirby. And Quasimodo.<br />\nI stopped, shocked, for one rarely sees such sights, even<br />\nin New Jersey. Derwood Quasimodo desperately grabbed<br />\nthe front of my shirt and between agonized gasps,<br />\nmuttered,\"You go to Hopkins?\"<br />\n\"Yes.\"<br />\n\"Oh, thank God! Please,\" he stammered, pathetically<br />\ndrooling onto my Ked All-Stars, \"what's the best thing<br />\nfor a backache?\"<br />\nFurious, I yanked his boney claws out of my chest,<br />\nyelling, \"I'm an English major!\" The helpless, gurgling<br />\nhulk tumbled into a wrinkled heap in the gutter as I<br />\nstalked away.<br />\nI had barely walked a block before guilt grabbed me,<br />\nand sent me hurrying back to the poor slob. I took out a<br />\npad of paper, wrote him a prescription for Darvocet, and<br />\nstuck it in his hand. From the gutter I heard a quiet,<br />\nsibilant, \"Thank you.\" He then clambered to his feet and<br />\nshambled off, undoubtedly in the direction of the nearest<br />\napothecary.<br />\nThe point of that story (parts of which, I admit, were<br />\nslightly exaggerated) should be all too obvious to anyone<br />\nattending Hopkins. The reputation of the university is<br />\nbased on the pre-medical program. Of course, the<br />\nengineering department also gets a lot of press, but let's<br />\nface it: that cassette -recorder-carrying,<br />\nanti-social-whirling, fashion-unconscious Hermit of<br />\nRemsen 103, the pre-med, is Numero Uno, El Supremo,<br />\nKing of the Campus. Time magazine writes articles about<br />\nhim, and takes his picture. Shiny new research centers are<br />\nbuilt for his benefit. Hopkins was made for him, just as<br />\nEden was made for that snakey little devil named Satan.<br />\nSo it's not such a big mystery why some old lady, upon<br />\nhearing where you partake your education, should tell<br />\nyou about the periodic spasms she gets between her toes.<br />\n<br />\nY<br />\n<br />\n4C<br />\n<br />\nI don't seriously mean to paint a negative picture of all<br />\npre-med students. In fact, I'm told that most of them are<br />\nindeed capable of normal motor functions, such as<br />\nwalking, waving hello, and licking envelopes. Nevertheless,<br />\npoking fun at this motley bunch of future golf amateurs is<br />\na time-honored Homewood tradition.<br />\nIn 1935, Dr. John Rathbone Oliver,a professor of biology<br />\nat Hopkins, wrote a book which boasted the pithy title,<br />\nThe Ordinary Problems of Everyday People. (Those<br />\nsuspicious souls who question my ability to tell the truth<br />\ncan find this book in the Eisenhower Library, call number<br />\nBJ 1581 .0 48.) Sounding like a cross between Mr. Chips<br />\nand Joyce Brothers, Dr. Oliver comments upon the youth<br />\nof Depression America and such topics as sex, hygiene,<br />\nand education. Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the<br />\none called, \"Pre-Medical.\" I quote directly from the good<br />\ndoctor's text:<br />\n\"Nowadays if a man wants to become a physician, he<br />\nhas to begin being one in his freshman year. And for the<br />\nnext four years he is - God save the mark! - 'pre-med.'<br />\nThis means that his courses are more or less prescribed all of them are science courses, with perhaps one language<br />\ncourse thrown in - biology, inorganic and organic<br />\nchemistry, physics, comparative anatomy. He gets no<br />\ngeneral cultivation in Litterae Humaniores. He does not<br />\neven know what they mean... His mind is a mass of<br />\nformulae, filled with test tubes and notes on experiments,<br />\nwith plans of pig embryos and the epigenetic intricacies of<br />\nthe frog...<br />\n\"Year by year I watch the 'pre-med' develop. By the<br />\ntime he has completed the courses which are absolutely<br />\nnecessary for him if he is to gain admission to any good<br />\nmedical school, he is science-fed and bred. He knows<br />\nnothing else. He has been shown nothing else. He has<br />\ninscrutable whims and laws? Are we, fellow non-science<br />\nbecome the grossest of gross materialists, to whom<br />\nmajors,\"the inferior ones\"?<br />\nanything beyond the reach of his senses, his microscope,<br />\nAs Mona Lisa said to Leonardo, \"Don't make Inc<br />\nand his Bunsen burner is riot only anathema, but also<br />\nlaugh!\"<br />\nutterly incomprehensible...<br />\nBesides, we mean no harm when we make the \"throat\"<br />\n\"Many misguided youths who want to study medicine \u2022 the butt of our good-natured scorn. We're only joking,<br />\nimagine that if they come to Hopkins for four years of<br />\nright? By the way, why did the pre-med cross the road?<br />\nundergraduate work, they will be sure of admission to the<br />\nBecause it was required.<br />\nI don't suppose pre-meds tell Art History major jokes,<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical School. Alas for many 'pre-med'<br />\nor International Studies major jokes, or English major<br />\ndisappointments!...<br />\njokes. I wouldn't mind if they did. After all, fair is fair.<br />\n\"The persistence of the 'pre-med' in search of a medical<br />\nBut, if such jokes existed, they would most likely lack the<br />\nschool is remarkable. If he finds no American school<br />\nmirthful malice of our barbs at pre-meds. They'd<br />\nwilling to take him, he will pack up and go abroad. This<br />\nprobably be like Toronto Blue Jay jokes: sad, pointless,<br />\ncontinually increasing stream of medical students who<br />\nyes, cruel. I also don't suppose that someday,<br />\nand,<br />\nwho<br />\nseek<br />\na medical<br />\nhave been rejected at home and<br />\noutfitted again in a Hopkins t-shirt, I'll be accosted by a<br />\neducation all the way from London and Edinburgh to<br />\nrabid tweed\u2014bedecked loon begging me on his hands and<br />\nCzechoslovakia and Soviet Russia proves clearly that there<br />\nknees to compare Shakespeare and Marlowe for him.<br />\nare more 'pre-meds' than there are places in our medical<br />\nschools.\"<br />\nSome things never change, do they?<br />\nDr. Oliver adds in a later paragraph, \"I do my best in<br />\nIt might be fitting, and a nice gesture to boot, to close<br />\nmy lectures, when I am talking about medicine as a career<br />\nwith some complimentary remarks on our friend, the<br />\npre-med. But if you think I'm going to be the one to<br />\nand the mental traits that go into the making of a good<br />\nmake them, you're crazy. Take it away, Doc Oliver:<br />\nphysician, to emphasize the length of medical training,<br />\n\"By and large. the pre-medical student, as I have<br />\nthe slowness of advancement, the lack of any very great<br />\nknown him, is a very decent sort. He may have no liking<br />\nfinancial reward.\" In the Library's copy of the- book,<br />\nfor English verse, he may know nothing about art and less<br />\nsome outraged reader underlined \"lack of any very great<br />\nabout music, he may, so far as the Litterae Humaniores<br />\nfinancial reward,\" and scribbled in the margin, \"Is he<br />\nare concerned, be an utter barbarian. But he has his good<br />\nkidding?\"<br />\npoints. He will spend happy hours with the lowest forms<br />\nof life, with animalculae and single cells... The 'pre-med' is<br />\ngoing to be a doctor. The mere idea is enough to set him<br />\nMaybe we mock pre-meds for the same reasons anyone<br />\nalbeit<br />\nfar above other men. And so I like him. I think I might<br />\nrealization,<br />\nthe<br />\nawe,<br />\nfear,<br />\nmockery:<br />\nresorts to<br />\nalmost love him if he did not insist on dissecting dead cats<br />\nsubconscious, that we are the inferior ones. Could these<br />\nin his room and then leaving the cadaver in the closet with<br />\nreally be the motives behind our put-downs of the<br />\nhis clothes and forgetting all about it.\"<br />\npre-med?

I think<br />\nshe's looking at you.\" But before Steve can discern<br />\nwhether the girl is really looking at him, he glances one<br />\nlast time at the beer. And then - she has disappeared. But<br />\nthe pitcher remains, old faithful friend. Many Ratgoers<br />\nare like this: wishing they could find someone and give up<br />\nthe Watching life but, at the same time, too afraid to<br />\ndetach themselves from the womb's safe stupor.<br />\nBut Watchers are not only male. Our fellow females often<br />\ncluster in three's and four's wondering whether they have<br />\ncaught the eye of any of the guys. \"I can't eat any more<br />\nof this pizza.\" \"OK, so leave it. Maybe we'll eat it later.\"<br />\nBut the night drags on, and they stop talking and start<br />\nlooking at their watches. \"My necklace isn't twisted, is<br />\nit?\"No, I don't think so.\" \"Oh.\"<br />\nBut not everyone takes Thursday night at the Rat sitting<br />\ndown. Clumps of fraternity brothers cluster in the<br />\nbackrooms grunting, pushing, and proving to everyone<br />\nthat they are enjoying themselves the way real men do.<br />\nSome of the bolder ones clog the passages from room to<br />\nroom actively ogling the occasional unattached female<br />\npassing through. \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" She disappears into the<br />\ncrowd.\"What a piece.\" \"Nice tits.\"<br />\nSimilar Watchers lounge around the periphery of the<br />\nance floor or near the bar. One girl is leanin against a<br />\n<br />\npole with a pleasantly bored expression on her face. \"Hi,<br />\nhow are you?\" asks an acquaintance. \"OK.\" \"Are you<br />\nhaving a good time?\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" with that<br />\nfatigued smile Watchers often wear.<br />\nNaturally, not everyone who goes to the Rat is a watcher.<br />\nIf this were true, the place could not have come by its<br />\nreputation as a meat market so easily. Apparently, some<br />\npeople take risks.<br />\nHe glances at her, and she doesn't look away. Could it<br />\nbe? Could this night be a little less lonely than the last?<br />\n(guy approaches girl, seated alone)<br />\nHe: Mind if I join you? (cute ass; probably a Goucher girl;<br />\nbut why is she alone?)<br />\nShe: No, go right ahead. (I hope this guy doesn't leave as<br />\nsoon as the last one did.)<br />\nHe: where do you go to school? (What a boring question.)<br />\nShe: Goucher. (I hope he hasn't pre-judged me by now.)<br />\nHe: Do you come here often?(God, it's hot in here.)<br />\nShe: Not really.(Where the hell else would I go?)<br />\nHe: What's your major? (This is beginning to sound like<br />\nTwenty Questions.)<br />\nShe: English. (I should have said drama; it sound more<br />\nexotic)<br />\nHe: Oh, yeah? What year are you in? (I hope she's a<br />\nfreshman, it'll be so much easier if she is)<br />\nShe: Soph. How about -you? (I bet he hopes I was a<br />\nfreshman. He probably can't think of anything else to<br />\nsay.)<br />\n<br />\nHe. Junior. (I hope she doesn't want to talk all evening.)<br />\nSILENCE<br />\nHe: Like disco music? (I hope it looks like I have better<br />\ntaste in music than that!)<br />\nShe: Not really - although it's great for dancing. (I hope<br />\nhe doesn't ask me to dance. I always get twisted up.)<br />\nHe: Wanna dance? (Why don't they ever play anything<br />\nslow?)<br />\nShe: Well.., why don't we talk a while'? (On closer<br />\ninspection, he's not as cute as I thought.)<br />\nHe: (Jesus, a conversation with her! Mission Impossible!)<br />\nWould you like something to drink? (I've got lotsa stuff in<br />\nWolman - if I can get her there.)<br />\nShe: Sure.(Maybe I should get out of this before it's too<br />\nlate.)<br />\nHe: Do you like beer? Or I could get a pitcher of Sangria?<br />\n(Hopefully, the bar will be crowded, and we'll have to go<br />\nsomewhere else.)<br />\nShe: Sounds great - the Sangria, that is. (I wonder what<br />\nI'm getting myself into.)<br />\nHe: Wanta come on up to the bar? (I can't lose her now.)<br />\nShe: Ok. (Too late to turn back. I may as well - why<br />\nnot?)<br />\nMaybe the problem with disco night is that the players<br />\nbecome entangled in their own elaborate games. What if<br />\n<br />\neveryone were honest?<br />\nPerson 1: Hey, you're cute. Would you like to make it<br />\nwith me tonight?<br />\nPerson 2: Well, give me a few minutes to think it over.<br />\nHMMMM...You're not bad looking, but I have a lot of<br />\nwork to do tomorrow, and I don't want to spend the<br />\nwhole day catching up on my sleep.<br />\nPerson 1: Sure, I understand. How about a quick lay - an<br />\nhour, tops - and then you can go home and get some rest?<br />\nPerson 2: Good idea. Your place or mine?<br />\nAt disco night guys are expected to assume the awesome<br />\nburden of the first move. But what if it were the other<br />\nway around?<br />\nShe: Hi.<br />\nHe: Hello.<br />\nShe Come here often?<br />\nHe Occasionally.<br />\nShe: What's your major?<br />\nHe: Psych.<br />\nShe: Oh? I'm in Natural Science.<br />\nHe: You mean you're a pre-med?<br />\nShe: Well, I'm not sure yet. I've only applied to twelvemedical schools so far.<br />\nHe: You're a senior?<br />\nShe: Yeah. How about you?<br />\nHe: I'm a freshman.<br />\nShe: Can I get you a beer'?<br />\nHe: No thanks I don't drink.<br />\nShe: Well, it's kind of hot in here. Let's go outside.<br />\nHe: Oh, I just remembered that I have to look for my<br />\nfriend. I'll be right back.<br />\nShe: Burned again.<br />\nOne of the major causes of the Rat's comm ni cation<br />\nbreakdown is the noise. The music is intentionally loud<br />\nenough to drown out all but the most hardy conversation<br />\nand drive the more complex verbiage onto the back room<br />\ntables where more subtle games can be enjoyed. Yet on<br />\nthe dance floor words are unnecessary. Body langirige<br />\nsays it all. Below, a typical dance floor conversation:<br />\nHe: Do you wanna dance?<br />\nShe: What?<br />\nHe: I said: DO YOU WANNA DANCE?<br />\nShe: Sure.<br />\nHe: What?<br />\nShe OK!!<br />\nHe: Bump<br />\nShe:Grind<br />\nHe: BumpGrind<br />\nShe: GrindBump<br />\nHe: BumpBumpgriiind....<br />\nShe: GrindBuMPbummbummbummP<br />\nHe: BumpgrINDind bumpbumpbumpGRIND!!!<br />\nShe: GrindbUMPumpgrindgrindgrindBUMP!!!<br />\nHe: You dance well.<br />\nShe What?<br />\nHe: Do you wanna take a walk outside?<br />\nShe Let's go outside. I can't hear you.<br />\nAll fairy tales have morals - even this one.<br />\nQ: Let's sit down and talk. What can we do about the<br />\nRat? I mean, how can we create an atmosphere that<br />\nallows people to communicate instead of play games?<br />\nA: Is this some kind of interview?<br />\nQ: well, yes....<br />\nA: Ok. I would say that the Rat should be torn down and<br />\na bright, beautiful, well-lit horticultural garden be put in<br />\nits place. Only then could men and women truly know<br />\neach other as friends and fulfill each other's emotional,<br />\nintellectual, and spiritual needs.<br />\nQ: I'm sorry, but this music is so loud that I couLlet heal<br />\nyou. Do you want to talk outside?

It is<br />\nthe Biophysics Department's Scanning Transmission<br />\nElectron Microscope, one of only three in the country<br />\nwith similar capabilities. Entering the small office where<br />\nits gleaming stainless steel cylinders and attendant<br />\nelectronic equipment are kept, one is surrounded by<br />\nimages of a new world -- a world which only a few years<br />\nago existed only in theory and metaphor; a world of<br />\nDNA molecules, mercury atoms, and atomic motions.<br />\nBuilt between 1971 and 1974 on a proposal by<br />\nDepartment Chairman Michael Beer and a grant from the<br />\nNational Institute of Health, the microscope differs from<br />\nother electron microscopes in that it scans its specimens<br />\nwith a concentrated electron beam. A picture is put<br />\ntogether much as in a television camera; only then it is<br />\nreduced to a set of mathematical data bits which can be<br />\nmanipulated by a computer. More conventional electron<br />\nmicroscopes work much like light microscopes, focusing<br />\nelctron beams with electromagnetic \"lenses.\"<br />\nAs Dr. Wendell Wiggins, the instrument's overseer,<br />\nstates, \"It's more complicated to build an image this<br />\nway.\" But for many reasons, it's worth it. One has more<br />\ncontrol over the electrons interacting with the specimen.<br />\nThere is no need to mechanically \"focus\" the electrons<br />\ninto an image. Other advantages arise from some of<br />\nelectron microscopy's more nagging problems.<br />\nUnlike most images formed by light microscopes, the<br />\nelectron<br />\nmicroscope image requires abstract<br />\nintellectualization to understand. Just like trying to learn<br />\nsomething about a golf ball in a dark room by firing<br />\nbeebees at it, it is hard to tell how much of what one<br />\n\"sees\" is the direct result of the \"looking.\" \"There is<br />\ngreat difficulty in interpreting the images,\" comments<br />\nWiggins. \"They don't do much for you to just look at<br />\nthem.\" For clarification, a compact and efficient PDP-11<br />\ncomputer is used to manipulate the picture data until<br />\nuseful pictures can be printed from it. Much the same<br />\nkind of operation is used in processing the pictures from<br />\nthe Mars probes.<br />\nWhen the machine started reliable operation in 1976,<br />\nthe theoretical lower limit of the microscope's seeing<br />\npower was rated at 3 angstroms, or about the size of<br />\nlarger atoms. Presently, only images about nine times that<br />\nsize can be clearly discerned due to the fact that, unlike<br />\natoms firmly attached to a larger molecule, most atoms<br />\n\"just don't stay put\" while one is looking at them. This<br />\nhas been a major problem in protein and DNA research<br />\nwhere it is important to know the positions of artificially<br />\nattached, highly visible heavy element atoms in order to<br />\ndeduce structure. Soon, however, a liquid helium stage<br />\naddition will allow researchers to \"freeze\" all molecular<br />\nmotion and see the hitherto unseeable. When the addition<br />\nis finished, the Hopkins microscope, with this thermal<br />\n\"stop-action\" capability, will be unique in the country.<br />\nIn the meantime, studying such problems as the<br />\ninteraction of proteins with chromosome constituents<br />\nwhere the movement problem is not as crucial, Wiggins<br />\nand other are pushing back the frontiers of knowledge to<br />\nuncover such possibilities as the cure of congenital<br />\ndiseases, and the design, modification, and possibly even<br />\nthe creation of life. Currently funded by both the<br />\nNational Institute of Health and the National Science<br />\nFoundation, the instrument's overseers are just now<br />\nproposing \"large scale collaboration\" with other<br />\ndepartments, labs and institutions which would extend<br />\nthe microscope's usefulness beyond the confines of the<br />\nBiophysics Department. One can only guess at the<br />\npossibilities from there.<br />\nMeanwhile, the day-to-day challenges will go on for<br />\nresearchers toiling in the musty obscurity of that Latrobe<br />\nHall basement. Of the typical tribulations, Wiggins, with a<br />\nknowing smile, relates the following story: \"(Sometimes)<br />\nwe've had an image which we didn't think much of, but<br />\nafter digesting it awhile began to appreciate it; or, on the<br />\nother hand, thought it was marvelous until we thought<br />\nabout it awhile and discovered it wasn't so hot after all.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\n7000 TIMES!<br />\nIF YOU'VE SAID IT ONCE,<br />\nYOU'VE SAID IT 7000 TIMES<br />\nIN THE HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nFOR INFORMATION ON<br />\nADVERTISING, CALL 338-7647 ON<br />\nTUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY, 1 TO 5 PM<br />\nAND ASK FOR PHIL OR ELLIOT.<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nINTERNATIONAL<br />\nCAREER?<br />\n<br />\nNews Letter<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events presents<br />\n<br />\nA Lecture/Workshop<br />\nAREAS<br />\n<br />\nFiNEST<br />\nA representative<br />\nwill be on the campus<br />\nMONDAY<br />\nOCTOBER 23, 1978<br />\nto discuss qualifications for<br />\nadvanced study at<br />\nAMERICAN<br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL<br />\nand job opportunities<br />\nin the field of<br />\n<br />\nhAIRCUTTINq<br />\nby<br />\n<br />\nROSE gOicIMAN<br />\nNAThEWiTCIII<br />\n<br />\nbENNy<br />\n<br />\nEitEEN<br />\n<br />\n3333<br />\n<br />\nqwird<br />\n<br />\nN.

When I decided to join<br />\nthe Hulabaloo staff in Feb. 1978<br />\nthe yearbook was almost dead.<br />\nFrom what I gathered then there<br />\nhadn't been a meeting of the<br />\nstaff in months. I met Bill<br />\nLaufer, Dogna Skoog, Dave<br />\nFryburg and some business staff<br />\nindividually. I was informed that<br />\nsome deadlines had already gone<br />\nby and none had been met. I<br />\npleaded with the editors to call a<br />\nmeeting of the entire staff and<br />\nperhaps get the ball rolling. Bill<br />\n<br />\nLau fe.r and Dogna Skoog<br />\neventually agreed to a time and<br />\nplace. Only Skoog, Fryburg, a<br />\nfew photographers and I showed<br />\nup. Skoog assured me that there<br />\nwas a layout staff, but until June<br />\nI only heard names and never saw<br />\none of their faces. At this<br />\nmeeting, I informed Skoog that I<br />\nwould join the staff to help with<br />\nthe photography. At no time was<br />\nI photography editor. I agreed to<br />\npick up film from the<br />\nphotography store, distribute and<br />\ncollect finished work from the<br />\nother photographers, and shoot<br />\nsome pictures myself.<br />\nSubsequently, I went to the<br />\nyearbook darkroom and found it<br />\nin shambles, and proceeded to<br />\nstraighten it up. I acquired<br />\npermission from the editors and<br />\nthe business staff to stock the<br />\ndarkroom with film, chemicals,<br />\nand a few basic tools. The total<br />\namount I spent and signed for<br />\nwas approximately $110.<br />\nContact sheets of photographs<br />\nwere given to Laufer but were<br />\nnever returned marked \"For<br />\nprinting\".<br />\nThe yearbook had another<br />\nchance but Laufer and Skoog<br />\nfailed to take advantage of it.<br />\nLate in February, a freelance<br />\nphotographer of the Freshman<br />\nclass showed me almost a<br />\nthousand of his personal<br />\n<br />\nnegatives covering all the events<br />\nof the university since Freshman<br />\norientation. The Freelance<br />\nphotographer told me he would<br />\nprint up any of the negatives the<br />\nyearbook wanted in the now<br />\nrefurbished darkroom. The .<br />\ncopies of all these negatives<br />\n(contact sheets) were shown to<br />\nLaufer shortly after. Laufer told<br />\nme that the layout staff would go<br />\nover the contact sheets, mark the<br />\nsuitable shots \"For printing\"<br />\nreturn them to me. It was the<br />\nend of May and neither Laufer<br />\nnor the so-called layout staff had<br />\nreviewed any of the available<br />\nphotographs. Luafer had almost<br />\n1000 pictures available to him<br />\nand did nothing. With no pictures<br />\nbeing examined by Laufer and<br />\nmarked \"For printing\" by the<br />\nend of May, I decided none<br />\nwould ever be forthcoming. The<br />\nFreelance photographer left with<br />\nhis negatives. The developing<br />\nequipment was left in the<br />\ndarkroom. If the photographs<br />\nwere marked from the contact<br />\nsheets they would have been<br />\nprinted.<br />\nIn the future, I would<br />\nappreciate that the<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nbe more sure of<br />\nits sources and suspicions before<br />\nit prints slander as fact.<br />\nsincerely,<br />\nHarvey Serota<br />\n<br />\nAEI<br />\n<br />\nWanted:<br />\nPublic Managers<br />\n<br />\nEMPLOYMENT INTERVIEWS<br />\n<br />\nA PANEL ON GRADUATE<br />\nMANAGEMENT TRAINING<br />\nFOR PUBLICSERVICE<br />\nCAREERS<br />\n<br />\nThe following companies are coming to campus to recruit Graduate<br />\nstudents for employment during the remainder of the month:<br />\n<br />\nCOMPUTER SCIENCES CORP.<br />\nGENERAL RESEARCH CORP.<br />\n<br />\n10/31<br />\n10/31<br />\n<br />\nThose interested in both Graduate and Undergraduate students are:<br />\n[ PROCTER & GAMBLE<br />\nNATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY<br />\n<br />\n10/25<br />\n10/30<br />\n<br />\nAny students interested in speaking with the representatives from these<br />\ncompanies, please come by to the Placement Bureau and sign up for an<br />\ni<br />\nRm. 135 Garland Hall.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nLL<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nfeaturina representatives from:<br />\nHarvard's JFK School of Government<br />\nYale School of Organization & Manag<br />\nBoston University School of Manag<br />\nCornell Graduate School of Business<br />\nand Public Administartion<br />\nSeniors, Juniors, and Faculty from<br />\nall departments welcome.<br />\nTHURSDAY, OCT. 26 at 11.30<br />\na.m. Inquire at the Placement<br />\nOffice, Garland Hall, J.H.U.<br />\n<br />\n'11111111111111111MNIOli<br />\n<br />\nINTERVIEWS<br />\nThe following Graduate and Professional schools will be visiting Hopkins<br />\nduring the coming weeks.

The forms we do have, we have borrowed<br />\nfrom our Europeanforebears, misshapen them to fit our<br />\noft-times profane American style, and vulgarized them by<br />\nour excessive wealth till they have become devoid of the<br />\nawe and feeling that such rituals should have.<br />\nOur failure to bring this chaos into a cohesive order is<br />\nthe theme of Robert Altman's latest movie,\"A Wedding.'<br />\nAltman has discovered a formula for making serious films<br />\nthat also do well at the box office. This has given almost<br />\nunlimited license to direct whatever he chooses, free from<br />\nthe normal limitations that restrict most commercial<br />\nmovie.making enterprises. At the same time, he is able to<br />\nattract top notch actors and actresses interested in making<br />\nserious cinema.<br />\n\"A Wedding\" continues in the tradition of the<br />\nwide-eyed criticism of American society that Altman did<br />\nso successfully in \"Nashville.\" Both are organized along<br />\nthe same basic set of principles; a certain paradigm is<br />\nchosen and scrupulously examined as a microcosm of the<br />\nsociety it inhabits. In \"Nashville,\" it was that pop capital<br />\nof American country music; in this movie, it is the<br />\nceremony and reception of a present day Midwestern<br />\nwedding.<br />\nThe ceremony takes place in a majestic, expansive<br />\ncathedral with beautifully crafted mahogany pews and<br />\nstunning blue imported stained glass windows presided<br />\nover by a doddering bishop in full red vestments. The<br />\npredicament is immediately apparent as the camera<br />\nintroduces us to the two families: on one side are the<br />\nred-headed, pale-skinned WASPs-- the bride Muffin(Amy<br />\nStryker); her younger sister, Buffy (Mia Farrow); their<br />\nmother, Tulip (Carol Burnett)-- and on the other side are<br />\nthe dark haired, swarthy-skinned Italian Catholics-- the<br />\ngroom Dino (Desi Arnaz, Jr.), and his father (Vittorio<br />\nGassman).Together they re-enact the archtypical<br />\nAmerican ritual, the melding together of the races.<br />\nThe tension in the movie, both dramatic and comic,<br />\nresults from the fact that now, as a two hundred year-old<br />\nnation, we finally have the means to create form and<br />\nstructure around our lives, but we are no longer<br />\ninterested. Geraldine Chaplin, as a kind of hired mistress<br />\nof ceremonies and guardian of non-existing traditions, is<br />\nconstantly being subverted in her efforts to impose order<br />\non this happy chaos.<br />\nFor example, the wedding present table is filled with<br />\ngifts of elegant porcelain, complete sets of lead crystal.<br />\n<br />\nDevo<br />\n<br />\nSeven Beauties<br />\n<br />\nPeter Gabriel<br />\n<br />\n-.01\u202211111114<br />\n<br />\nand silver candelabras. Yet the tableaux is ruined as some<br />\neccentric socialist Aunt unveils her gift to the bride- a full<br />\nsized portrait of the bride standing topless against a<br />\nbackground of smoke-stacked factories. Another time,<br />\nChaplin corrals all the young unmarrieds around the<br />\nstaircase for the tossing of the bouquet. She carefully<br />\nleads Muffin up the stairs, stops her halfway, and instructs<br />\nher to toss the flowers. Down below, the vestal virgins<br />\nplay hot potato with it- none relishing the role of being<br />\nthe next to take her vows while giving up her precious<br />\nfreedom- till it falls innocuously into the hands of Lauren<br />\nHutton, who heads the movie team that is filming the<br />\nwhole affair.<br />\nNot only is the form of the wedding being subverted,<br />\nbut its substance as well. The American system of pairing,<br />\nwhat Professor Money terms the Virgin Bride and the<br />\nDouble Standard, is no longer adequate to contain our<br />\never wandering passions. Before long, we learn that the<br />\ngroom may have impregnated his wife's younger sister<br />\nBuffy, only to find that Buffy has been to bed with no<br />\nfewer than twenty other men in recent months. Buffy<br />\nspeaks very little during the movie, but wears a sly<br />\nover-satiated grin that tells all. Chaplin cannotcontain her<br />\npassion for the bride. Even the bride's mother gets into<br />\nthe action, succumbing to the insipid attestations of love<br />\n<br />\nfrom an obese but lovable member (Pat McCormack) of<br />\nthe groom's family.<br />\nThe failure to perceive forms soon degrades into a<br />\nfailure to perceive reality. When the matriarchal figure<br />\n(Lillian Gish) who presides in Faulkneresque fashion as<br />\nDowager Queen over the whole household dies, she<br />\ncontinues to reign. People come in, congratulate her, and<br />\nask her advice about the arrangements- all after she has<br />\npassed away. No one seems to notice. No one seems to<br />\ncare. When someone finally discovers she is dead, they are<br />\ndumbfounded. What do you say? How do you tell the<br />\nfamily? These questions prove to be just too perplexing<br />\nand the decision is made to say nothing at all, while the<br />\nneurotic nurse is given the job of keeping up appearances.<br />\nOnly through the whispering channels of gossip does word<br />\nof her death leak out, and then it spreads like wildfire. So<br />\nwhen one of the sisters gathers the family together in one<br />\nroom to tell them the tragic news,,not one person there<br />\nhasn't already heard. When it is all over, they shake her<br />\nhand and congratulate her on the fine job she has done.<br />\nWealth, as the American solution to all problems, goes<br />\nfar to cover up these imperfections but it too ultimately<br />\nsubverts itself. Everyone is beautifully dressed; the<br />\ngroom's house is decorated with lush peach satins and<br />\nCont. on p. 21<br />\n<br />\n61 1?tertaiimept<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nThe Sex Pistols<br />\nSwept Away<br />\n<br />\nJulia<br />\n<br />\nA Wedding<br />\n<br />\n'Julia'Examines The Complexity<br />\nOfHuman Relationships<br />\nBY DAVID KAPLAN<br />\nDisaster has a markedimpact on all human relationships.<br />\nWhat may have seemed a strong friendship rapidly<br />\ndetenorates in the face of uncontrollable outside crises;<br />\nor, more fortunately, alignments may grow and<br />\nstrengthen as both persons discover that mutual comfort<br />\nand assistance is an easier way to face catastrophe.<br />\n\"Julia\", which will be playing on October 21st and 22nd<br />\nin Shriver Hal; explores how war and a diseased world<br />\neffects so profoundly the relationship between two very<br />\nremarkable women: Lillian Hellman,portrayed by Jane<br />\nFonda, and her friend Julia, played by Vanessa Redgrave.<br />\nOn the surface, \"Julia' is a rather uncomplicated if<br />\nunsettling story (unsettling perhaps because it is a true<br />\nstoiy by Lillian Hellman). It chronicles the evolution of<br />\nLillian's and Julia's friendship, from their childhood<br />\nonward. The main body of the film, however, takes place<br />\nin 1930's Europe as Lillian tries to discover what has<br />\nhappened to Julia, who is working for the German<br />\nunderground. The fact that Lillian persists in the face of<br />\nunsympathetic guards, incomprehensible telephone<br />\noperators, and increasingly suspicious authorities is a<br />\n<br />\nbeautiful example of how friendship can and does<br />\novercome those things which seek to destroy it. Julia is<br />\nfinally able to communicate with Lillian through an agent<br />\nof the anti-Fascism movement. She attempts to enlist<br />\nLillian's participation in a scheme to smuggle a great<br />\namount of money into Geimany, and Lillian finally agrees<br />\nto undertake the dangerous mission of transporting<br />\nmoney to Berlin en route to the Soviet Union.<br />\nThat, for the most part, is the plot of the film. But<br />\n\"Julia\" did not win three Academy Awards on the basis<br />\nof its plot. The true story lies in the development of the<br />\nmain characters and in the conflicts that repeatedly<br />\nconfront them. The decisions which must be made are not<br />\nsimple. Lillian recognizes that in order to accord with her<br />\nprinciples, she must help the German underground. But<br />\nher feelings of social justice and her feeling of loyalty to<br />\nboth Julia and her ideals do not rest easily with her own<br />\nentirely understandable fears. It would be all too easy to<br />\nbask in her emerging success as a playwright and to ignore<br />\nwhat is happening in Europe. Lillian knows this-- still, she<br />\nhesitates, as any person would. What is best about the<br />\nfilm is that the characters are people, and I believe that it<br />\nreaches its peak when one can see the play of these<br />\nclashing emotions in the expressions of the characters.<br />\n<br />\nVanessa Redgrave and Jane Fonda in Julia<br />\nThe world of \"Julia\" is indeed a threatening one, and<br />\nthe film seeks to remind you of that fact over and over<br />\nagain. Scenes of mass riots, stills of Nazi rallies, and the<br />\never present police have a definite purpose- for \"Julia\" is<br />\nnot only a story of love but also a story of hatred and<br />\nterror. This is highlighted by the eerie calm and lack of<br />\nconcern in many of the other scenes. The movie begins<br />\nand ends in the quiet of a lake and the story starts with<br />\nLillian writing, or struggling to write, a play in a cottage<br />\nCont. on p. 20<br />\n<br />\n\fillustration by Lisa Kay Pease<br />\n<br />\nWe lined up civilly according<br />\nto the time we had arrived. First<br />\nin line was 10:15, followed by<br />\n10:32 -- he had a friend. Then<br />\ncame 11:08, two guys at 11:42<br />\nand two girls at 11:54 -- one was<br />\npretty, the other was not. I was<br />\nnext at 2:13, and behind me<br />\ncame several more. We were the BY STEPHEN BARR<br />\ndie-hards, the devoted, the ones<br />\nwho would do anything -- even if<br />\nthat meant waiting over 70<br />\ncombined hours in front of<br />\nRecordmasters at the Rotunda<br />\nlast Friday (the 13th) to get<br />\ntickets for the Peter Gabriel<br />\nconcert.<br />\nI had heard stories and seen<br />\nnews reels of tne lines that<br />\nencircle Madison Square Garden<br />\nann other such arenas prior to<br />\nthe sale of concert tickets -Zeppelin in '72, Dylan in '75,<br />\nSpringsteen in '78. I was aware of<br />\nthose who camp out in line, days<br />\nin advance, to ensure themselves<br />\na ticket to some momentous concert. And just that day<br />\n(the 13th), I had heard on the radio of the record sell-out<br />\nfor Springsteen at the Capitol Centre. So it wasn't too<br />\ndifficult to see the Beckettian absurdity of our situation;<br />\n12 or so people \"camped out,\" waiting for the arrival of<br />\nsome unknown man with the tickets that would allow us<br />\nto see Gabriel.<br />\nWhether the concert was even going to happen was<br />\noften in question. First it was on, and the word spread<br />\nfast. Then it was off, then on again. The new word was<br />\nthat tickets would go on sale at noon on Friday (the<br />\n13th) at selected Baltimore record stores. I called ,<br />\nRecordmasters numerous times Thursday and Friday<br />\nmorning: their word was, \"We will be selling tickets, they<br />\naren't in yet.\" I was told when I called at 1:30 that if the<br />\nman did not show, there was the possibility of a riot. At<br />\nthat point, I decided I better get my ass in gear, get down<br />\nto the store, and wait in line like all the rest if I really<br />\nwanted tickets.<br />\nI entered the store. The potentially riotous crowd<br />\nnumbered 10, lined casually and quietly in front of the<br />\ncash register, leaning on record racks, record boxes and<br />\nanything else they could find. I tried to figure out which<br />\nend was the end; no one objected when I joined the one<br />\n<br />\nWAITING FOR<br />\nGABRIEL<br />\n<br />\nThe Sex Pistols<br />\nStill Firing Away<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 19<br />\neverything we were told was true<br />\nwas later countered by something<br />\ndifferent. At 4:00 we learned the<br />\nCivic Center was sold out; at<br />\n5:00, the line had formed around<br />\nthe building and there were no<br />\ntickets -- yet. The most<br />\ndevastating word came at 5:30<br />\nwhen two girls told us the whole<br />\nthing was a farce. That was the<br />\nlast thing we wanted to hear, at<br />\nthat hour, when several of us<br />\nwere questioning whether it<br />\nwould be worthwhile to continue<br />\nto wait.<br />\nAround 6:00, many were<br />\nbeginning to give up hope. The<br />\nstore would remain open until<br />\n9:00, but some had been waiting<br />\nalmost eight hours, and the pain<br />\nwas getting to be too much.<br />\nWhen we tried to sit down<br />\noutside the store, a security<br />\nguard told us we had to stand. He<br />\ndidn't mind us loitering around<br />\nthe entrance to Recordmasters,<br />\nbut he didn't want us to sit. One member of the 10:32<br />\nduo had to go somewhere, and he was replaced by a<br />\nfriend. A couple who had arrived later than I couldn't<br />\nwait any longer, so they gave their money and number to<br />\na perfect stranger who also was wiating for tickets. As<br />\ndusk fell, we crowded closer to the entrance, as if we were<br />\nexpecting some word from within. Passers-by would look<br />\nover our shoulders to see what was happening, and<br />\ncustomers would ask our permission to enter.<br />\nI had made two phone calls to the friend with whom I<br />\nwas to attend the concert -- I wanted to tell her how I was<br />\nsuffering -- but both times she wasn't home. At 6:20, I<br />\nthought it was time to try again. I went into the store for<br />\nchange, and before I left I felt compelled to ask for news<br />\nin case they were hiding anything from us. I was calmly<br />\ninformed the small rotund man in the red cardigan and<br />\nchecked pants was the man with the tickets. It was 6:27. I<br />\nput the change in my pocket as I took out the bills. Then,<br />\nI went to tell the others the news. The man was so<br />\nunassuming he had slipped by all of us without even a<br />\nhint of suspicion. Nevertheless, he had the tickets.<br />\nIt was 6:43. I was in posession of two tickets to the<br />\nPeter Gabriel concert at the Lyric Theatre on October<br />\n\u2022<br />\n26th. Hope lives on forever!<br />\n<br />\nnearest the door. They greeted me politely and told me<br />\nthe current news. Then they graciously turned back to<br />\ntheir friends, books or prior acquaintances to continue<br />\ntheir methods of killing time. No one was disrupting<br />\nanything no one was even distracting or rude as we let<br />\ncustomers by. We were orderly, waiting for the man with<br />\nthe tickets. Definitely not the stuff riots are made of.<br />\nAt 3:00, we were asked to move our line outside<br />\nbecause the managers felt we were too numerous to loiter<br />\nin their small store. I lingered a moment, and when I<br />\nexited, the others were lined up against the walls on both<br />\nsides of the door. Again, I couldn't figure out which was<br />\nthe end -- and again, no one directed me -- so I flipped a<br />\ncoin to choose which wall to lean against. There we were,<br />\napproximately 12 people with nothing to say and nothing<br />\nto do but .wait for some man who was supposed to be<br />\ndelivering the tickets.<br />\nWhen noon had passed without the man, I had learned<br />\nthat the new ETA was 3:00. That deadline had come and<br />\ngone: now the man was expected to arrive at 6:00.<br />\nRumors began to fly -- we were beginning to feel<br />\nfrustrated and desperate.

Predictably, the Associated Press used this incident<br />\nas an excuse to malign J.- :,ex Pistols and the new wave<br />\nscene in general.

He is caught at a<br />\nrather unfortunate moment, but is later released.<br />\nMost of the movie is in a series of long flashbacks; in<br />\nreality, Pasqualino is at the Italian front. After a number<br />\nof brilliant escapades, he and a friend, along with their<br />\nfellow soldiers, are caught by the Germans.<br />\nThe commander of the concentration camp is a typical<br />\nWertmuller female, a huge woman with large, impressive<br />\nbreasts. Pasqualino is able to attract her with his bold and<br />\ndaring exploits. After he asks to be freed, his loyalty is<br />\ntested when he is asked to shoot his friend. After some<br />\nhesitation, Pasqualino does it, creating a turmoil in which<br />\nseveral people die and other prisoners escape. Meanwhile,<br />\nPasqualino is able to have sex with the commander who<br />\noverwhelms him with her huge, obnoxious body, leaving<br />\nhim impotent.<br />\nSeven Beauties may be said to be an introspective<br />\nstudy of man's instinct for survival, at times against<br />\nimpossible odds. Pasqualino displays of this instinct; one<br />\nmust stay alive at all costs, even if one has to abandon<br />\nfriends and values. More importantly, Wertmuller is<br />\n;clearly expressing her disapproval of Social Darwinism. At<br />\nthe same time, she explores other minor themes such as<br />\n;how an organization like the Mafia operates. These other<br />\nI themes have already been dealt with by other prominent<br />\n;<br />\ndirectors, but Wertmuller's approach is quite unique.<br />\nCompared to the bizarre Seven Beauties, Swept Away<br />\nis seemingly simple. Raffaella (Mariangelo Melato) is a<br />\n- lovely female, but a capitalist bitch taking a cruise on the<br />\nMediterranean. Gennarino (Giannini) is a steward on the<br />\n<br />\ncruise ship. Aboard the ship, Gennarino , a proletarian<br />\npig, is aggravated by the whims and fancies of Raffaella<br />\nwho expects unusual service of him. On an unusually<br />\nsunny day, Raffaella goes out sailing with Gennarino<br />\nattending her boat. Suddenly, the sea turns 'unhealthy' as<br />\nmenacing clouds appear overhead. They are left stranded,<br />\n's away by unusual destiny in the blue sea of Au.' To add<br />\nto the unfortunate crisis, the engine fails, and Raffaella,<br />\nwho keeps pickering on Gennarino for her fate, is left to<br />\nthe complete mercy of the latter, who is far more<br />\nknowledgable about sailing and the geography of the area.<br />\nThus, in the ensuing battle of words, there is a complete<br />\nreversal of roles.<br />\nThe next morning the two land on a deserted island.<br />\nGennarino is accustommed to living in forlorn and hard<br />\ncircumstances, but Raffaella is new to such harsh<br />\nsituations. In a series of humorous and informative shots,<br />\nRaffaella is converted to a virtual slave. Thus, when<br />\nGennarino finally makes love to her, his domination of<br />\nher is complete. However, he is so infatuated by her that<br />\nthe audience is once again left in the midst of a partial<br />\nreversal of roles, leaving both of them as equals.<br />\nAt the moment when they're deeply\"in love with each<br />\nother, a ship appears on the horizon. The two are<br />\ncompelled to play the roles again that destiny set forth<br />\nfor them. Despite all their efforts, Raffaella and<br />\nGennarino are separated. The movie leaves the viewer<br />\nwith a sad expression evoking his sympathy for the<br />\nproletarian Gennarino.<br />\nBesides being a movie essentially about the class<br />\nstruggle, it is also a rather trivial examination of<br />\nEuro-Communism in Italy. Perhaps Wertmuller is saying,<br />\nto quote Dr. Johnson, that eminent man of letters, that<br />\n'very few live by choice. Every man is placed in his<br />\npresent condition by causes which acted without his<br />\nforesight, and with which he did not always willingly<br />\nco-operate.' Male viewers will find Raffaella a bitchy type<br />\nyet incredibly beautiful; female viewers will scoff at the<br />\nreaction of their partners, asserting that her beauty is'<br />\n\u2022<br />\nartificiaE<br />\n<br />\nCont. from p. t8<br />\non. the shore. Throughout the movie, an essential<br />\ncontradiction emerges as this cloistered, almost artificial<br />\nworld is set against the all too real world in which Julia<br />\nmust live. It is a jarring experience for us and for Lillian,<br />\nwhen she is dragged out of the former life to aid Julia in<br />\nthe latter.<br />\nThe film also does an excellent job in juxtaposing the<br />\npresent world with a series of flashbacks dealing with the<br />\nearly friendship between the young friends. These scenes<br />\nserve to illuminate and to foretell the later story<br />\nThroughout, we see how Julia has acted as a guiding<br />\ninfluence on Lillian-- in dangers both easily and not so<br />\neasily seen. It is she who has contributed more than<br />\nanyone else to Lillian's moral and personal development.<br />\nJust as she had helped to form Lillian's character in those<br />\nearlier days of their relationship, so the continues to exert<br />\na powerful influence even when she is gone.<br />\nTher are other characters within the film, but they are<br />\nonly secondary to this fundamental relayionship. Chief<br />\namong these is mystery writer Dashiell Hammett, played<br />\nby Jason Robards. He, too, has an impact on Lillian as she<br />\ntries to reconcile her love of fame and fortune with her<br />\npersonal values. \"Julia\" is for the most part an excellent<br />\nfilm. It has received many awards and much praise from<br />\ncritics. Its only possible fault is that it tends toward being<br />\noverly sentimental in places. However, most of the scenes<br />\nare done with just the right mixture of ingredients.<br />\nPerhaps, the best part about the story is that it deals with<br />\nthe friendship of two women, a topic not touched upon<br />\nuntil recently, and it does this with a great deal of taste<br />\n\u2022<br />\nand perception.<br />\n<br />\nGET WELL<br />\nITO LISA H.<br />\nSOON!!!--OHTHE ARTS EDITOR<br />\n<br />\nLina Wertmuller<br />\n<br />\nJane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave<br />\n<br />\n.1\u2022111. .41M00. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022..1111111. .41M<br />\n<br />\nCOMMUNITY ORGANIZERS<br />\n<br />\nBadl Brunch Buffet<br />\n1<br />\n1 All you can eat $1.50<br />\nI in the JSA Sukkah<br />\n.<br />\ni<br />\n1 (Behmd Old Dorms)<br />\n1 Sunday, 11:30-1:00 pm<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nIIIP<br />\n<br />\nACORN needs organizers to work with low and moderate<br />\nincome families in 14 states (AR, SD, TX, LA, TN, MO, FL,<br />\nCO, NV, PA, 1A, OK, MI, AZ) for political and economic<br />\njustice.

Usually, the Budget<br />\nCommittee has submitted a<br />\ngreater hike than the one<br />\nadopted.<br />\nAccording to University<br />\nPresident Dr. Steven Muller, this<br />\nagreement does not necessarily<br />\nset a precedent. In the past,<br />\nMuller said, the recommended<br />\nfigures have been based on<br />\nprinciple and were too vague, or<br />\nthey were unacceptably high.<br />\nAccording to Professor of<br />\nPolitical Honomy Dr. Bela<br />\nBalassa, who chairs the Faculty<br />\nBudget Committee, the tuition<br />\nincreases had been falling behind<br />\nthose of ther schools. This affects<br />\nthe size of the faculty, he said.<br />\nThough next year's $4500<br />\ntuition bill is 11% above this<br />\nyear's $4050, the net rise in<br />\nrevenues is only 3% because of<br />\nthe projected 8% jump in the<br />\ncost of living. had tuition only<br />\nrisen at the same rate as inflation,<br />\nnext year's hike would have been<br />\n$324, $126 less than the actual<br /><br />\nOCTOBER 20,1978<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br /><br />\nincrease.<br />\nThis difference will free<br />\nenough money to stave off<br />\napproximately 7-8 faculty cuts,<br />\nBalassa said. He obtained this<br />\nfigure by multiplying 2200, the<br />\ncont. on p. 8<br /><br />\nBudget and personnel<br />\nreductions in the Central<br />\nAdministration of the University<br />\nare currently being studied by a<br />\ntask force headed by Budget<br />\nDirector Norman Krueger. The<br />\nstudy will be completed by the<br />\nend of October, when<br />\npreparation of next year's budget<br />\nwill begin.<br />\nApproximately one year ago,<br />\nPresident Muller informed<br />\nadministration colleagues of the<br />\nneed to hold the administration<br />\nbudget at last year's level. This<br />\naction will cut the budget by 8%<br />\nin real terms. To effect this<br />\nreduction, Krueger's committee<br />\nwas formed.<br />\nThe committee has spent the<br />\nlast three months reviewing the<br />\nbudgets and needs of the various<br />\nareas within Central<br />\nAdministration (purchasing,<br />\nadministrative services,personnel).<br />\nDuring that period, the<br />\ncommittee met on thirty-two<br />\noccasions.<br />\nNow that the review is<br />\ncompleted, the committee must<br />\nevaluate the information it has<br />\nreceived to determine what areas<br />\ncan be cut back and what areas<br />\nshould be augmented.

He must<br /><br />\nbe permitted to present his views, whether in the context<br />\nthey were presented last May or any other. Many would<br />\ndeny this, and their attitude is no more enlightened than<br />\n16th century peasants who condoned the burning of<br />\nheretics. But Dr. Pfeffer's views need no repression -- they<br />\nare quite capable of falling on their own merits. They are an<br />\nintellectual crock.<br />\nDr. Pfeffer grandiloquently titles his speech<br />\n\"Appearances and Reality.\" Fine. isn't the reality that<br />\ndespite all the junk food and chemical preservatives our<br />\ncapitalist society supposedly forces us to ingest, people in<br />\nthe Western world today live the longest, healthiest lives in<br />\nhuman history? Being so close to reality, doesn't Dr. Pfeffer<br />\nknow that in Belgium, no such additives of any kind are<br />\nallowed? Can he produce evidence to show that Belgians are<br />\nhappier or healthier than other Europeans? Even more to<br />\nthe point of his speech, will he try to persuade us that<br />\nBelgium is a less capitalist country than France or Holland?<br />\nUniversities Dr. Pfeffer accuses of repression and of<br />\nrefusal to teach the truth. But isn't it true that societies of<br />\npeople everywhere and at all times are extremely<br />\nnarrow-minded and intolerant of dissent? Aren't so-called<br />\nnon-capitalist countries like the Soviet Union much more<br />\nstifling of free discussion than the United States? And aren't<br />\nuniversities the one place in this country where a man with<br />\nviews as wild and patently implausible as Dr. Pfeffer's can<br />\nnot only be heard, but can get paid for voicing them?<br />\nThe reason Marxist doctrine is so offensive to many<br />\npeople who think is because it is precisely that, a rigid and<br />\ndeterministic dogma. Karl Marx was an intelligent and<br />\ninsightful thinker, but so were Aristotle and Max Weber, to<br />\nname just two.

If the Justice<br />\nDepartment at times appears to<br />\nseriously enforce anti-trust<br />\nlegislation, the reality of<br />\nenforcement proceedings<br />\nconfirms in practice the<br />\ntranscendence of our society's<br />\ncommitment to big business.

And, yes,<br />\nwhat of the role of the<br />\nuniversity?<br />\n!he place to begin to answer<br />\nthis question is with the<br />\nde-sanctification of the university<br />\nand of its professors.

And, on<br />\nthe whole, universities and social<br />\nscientists do not bite the hands<br />\nthat feed them. The production<br />\nof knowledge,like productions on<br />\nAmerican TV, is inextricably<br />\nlinked to capitalist production<br />\nand capitalist rule.<br />\nThis is hardly unusual. The<br />\nrealities of power and authority<br />\nin every society have decisively<br />\nshaped what is presumed to be<br />\ntrue, what can be recognized and<br />\ntolerated as true, and what truths<br />\nwill be held most dear. These<br />\npower realities shape social<br />\nscience in the U.S. into what it<br />\npredominantly is: fragmented,<br />\nover-specialized, jargonized fields<br />\nof thought, constructed on liberal<br />\nand capitalist assumptions about<br />\nthe nature of human beings and<br />\nthe nature of the world.<br />\nEstablished social scienc_.<br />\ntherefore, is never neutral.<br />\nBut it is not merely cyri.cal<br />\nself-interest that explains why<br />\nour social scientists do not help<br />\nus to understand the truth about<br />\nour society and our lives. Social<br />\nscientists, too, are creatures of<br />\nthe daily lives they lead - of the<br />\nsocialization, pre-professional<br />\nand professional, they have<br />\nundergone in eapitalist America.<br />\nThey too are confounded by<br />\nappearances. Their consciousness,<br />\ntoo, is bounded by the limits of<br />\ntheir daily experience. And, for<br />\nthe most part, the daily lives of<br />\nour professors and other social<br />\nscientists are strikingly isolated<br />\nfrom the daily lives of the<br />\nmajority of our people - those<br />\nwho toil in unrewarding, blueand lower white-collar jobs,<br />\ntrying simply to get through the<br />\nday with some dignity. If<br />\nprofessors lived and worked like<br />\nfactory workers, they might<br />\nthink and write differently. But<br />\ntheir worlds are systematically<br />\ndivided, if invisibly inter-related;<br />\nso what passes for social science<br />\ntoo rarely penetrates to the<br />\nessence of our people's reality.<br />\nOnce we surrender the<br />\nprotective sense of our own<br />\nuniqueness, we can apply a<br />\nuniversal truth to our own<br />\ninstitutions: throughout history<br />\nthe dominant institutions in<br />\nevery society, whatever their<br />\nclaims to the contrary, have more<br />\nor less reinforced the existing,<br />\nlimited social consciousness and<br />\nthe accompanying<br />\nmisperceptions of social reality.<br />\nWhether done in the name of a<br />\nhigh priest, or in the name of a<br /><br />\nfull professor, institutionally<br />\nrevealed truths typically are<br />\nconfining, misleading, and<br />\nself-serving.<br />\nThe sad fact, then, is that our<br />\nmajor universities and our social<br />\nsciences, with all the endless<br />\ninformation they spew forth<br />\nabout our social reality, do not<br />\nhelp us much in understanding<br />\nwhy our lives are the way they<br />\nare, or what we must do to<br />\nchange them for the better.<br />\nFortunately, since we all live<br />\nin the concrete, material reality<br />\nof our own daily lives, a myriad<br />\nof unexceptional events impinge<br />\nupon our inherited consciousness<br />\nand confront the sophisticated<br />\npropaganda that everywhere<br />\nsurrounds us.

The mass (granted that<br />\n\"masses\" are not too educated)<br />\nof \"revolutionaires\" in the<br />\nSixties were highly educated people,<br />\nwho wished to avoid the Vietnam<br />\nwar, the dominance of their parents,,<br />\nwho had a desire to change the<br />\nof higher<br />\nelite<br />\nstructure<br />\neducation, among other things.<br />\nSurely Mr. Arcure is not thinking<br />\nof the student disturbances in<br />\nCornell and Berkelely as an<br />\nexample of how the \"uneducated<br />\nentered the decision-making<br />\nprocess\" in higher education?<br />\nTo point out all the errors in Mr.<br />\nArcure's essay is a task that<br />\nwould require an essay as big as<br />\nhis. Since Mr. Arcure wishes to<br />\nbe precise and accurate, one may<br />\npoint out that a Classical<br />\nEducation did not consist of<br />\n\"History, Philosophy, Languages,<br />\nLiterature, Mathematics, Science<br />\nand Art,\" as Mr. Arcure seems to<br />\nthink. A classical education<br />\nconsisted of the Seven Liberal<br />\nArts (Arts of Language and<br />\nNumber), which were Grammar,<br />\nRhetoric, Logic, Arithmatic<br />\nand<br />\nGeometry,<br />\nMusic,<br />\nAstronomy. Science and Art in<br />\nthemselves encompass every<br />\nsubject in the Humanities, Social<br />\nSciences, Natural Sciences, and<br />\nQuantitative<br />\nSciences.<br />\nIn<br />\naddition to the Seven Liberal<br />\nArts students were required to<br />\ntake Latin and Greek (and<br />\nsometimes theology).<br />\nAs Mr. Arcure himself says,<br />\n\"what need is there to defend as<br />\nlarge<br />\nand<br />\nan<br />\nprestigious<br />\ninstitution as Johns Hopkins?\"<br />\nMr. Arcure condemns those<br />\ncritics who are prejudiced and<br />\npresent as unrealistic picture of<br />\nthe state of higher education in<br />\nwith<br />\nAmerica,<br />\nespecially<br />\nreference to Johns Hopkins. Yet,<br />\nMr. Arcure himself sounds and<br />\nbehaves like one of those critics.<br />\nNeedless to say, one can do<br />\nwithout emotional outbursts,<br />\nsuch as Mr. Arcure's essay, in the<br />\nfuture.<br /><br />\n13,1978 included an editorial<br />\nwhich criticized the \"indolent<br />\nknaves\" of the Student Council<br />\nfor not meeting for two weeks.<br />\nPlease be informed that:<br />\n1)The S.C. did not met on<br />\nOctober 4, 1978 due to the<br />\nCareer Advising Week activites of<br />\nthe evening.<br />\n2) The S.C. postponed its<br />\nOctober 11 meeting (rescheduled<br />\nfor October 16) in respect for<br />\nthose Jewish Council members<br />\nwho were observing the Jewish<br />\nHigh Holy day of Yom Kippur.<br />\nThank-you<br />\nMonroe Zeffert<br />\nSenior Class President<br />\nTo the Editor and Mr. Wile:<br />\nSorry Dan, your comments on<br />\nthe Chaplain's office hold<br />\nabsolutely no water this time. An<br /><br />\necumenical religious institution'<br />\nsuch as the Chaplain's office<br />\nfinds that it can best serve the<br />\nspiritual needs of its constituency<br />\nby addressing pressing and<br />\nclear-cut moral issues that should<br />\nbe of interest to all people,<br />\nreligious or non-religious, who<br />\nexpress concern for their fellow<br />\nman. Sincere concern requires<br />\nactivity. One of the primary<br />\nactivities of the Chaplain's office<br />\nis to provide sources of<br />\ninformation and various<br />\nalternative views on issues<br />\nconcerning human rights. Not<br />\nsurprisingly, a special effort is<br />\nmade to provide a platform for<br />\nthe victims of persecution or<br />\nrepression whose views, for<br />\nwhatever reason, are distorted or<br />\nnot heard in the commercial<br />\nmedia.

Wearing my best blue jeans and my<br />\ncrummiest Johns Hopkins University t-shirt, I walked<br />\ndown a leaf-strewn avenue when suddenly I was<br />\napproached by a man resembling Quasimodo. That is, he<br />\nwas hunched over in apparent pain. His facial features<br />\nwere only mildly twisted, and his hair was, for the most<br />\npart, combed. Not a bad-looking fellow actually. Sort of<br />\nreminded me of Derwood Kirby. And Quasimodo.<br />\nI stopped, shocked, for one rarely sees such sights, even<br />\nin New Jersey. Derwood Quasimodo desperately grabbed<br />\nthe front of my shirt and between agonized gasps,<br />\nmuttered,\"You go to Hopkins?\"<br />\n\"Yes.\"<br />\n\"Oh, thank God! Please,\" he stammered, pathetically<br />\ndrooling onto my Ked All-Stars, \"what's the best thing<br />\nfor a backache?\"<br />\nFurious, I yanked his boney claws out of my chest,<br />\nyelling, \"I'm an English major!\" The helpless, gurgling<br />\nhulk tumbled into a wrinkled heap in the gutter as I<br />\nstalked away.<br />\nI had barely walked a block before guilt grabbed me,<br />\nand sent me hurrying back to the poor slob. I took out a<br />\npad of paper, wrote him a prescription for Darvocet, and<br />\nstuck it in his hand. From the gutter I heard a quiet,<br />\nsibilant, \"Thank you.\" He then clambered to his feet and<br />\nshambled off, undoubtedly in the direction of the nearest<br />\napothecary.<br />\nThe point of that story (parts of which, I admit, were<br />\nslightly exaggerated) should be all too obvious to anyone<br />\nattending Hopkins. The reputation of the university is<br />\nbased on the pre-medical program. Of course, the<br />\nengineering department also gets a lot of press, but let's<br />\nface it: that cassette -recorder-carrying,<br />\nanti-social-whirling, fashion-unconscious Hermit of<br />\nRemsen 103, the pre-med, is Numero Uno, El Supremo,<br />\nKing of the Campus. Time magazine writes articles about<br />\nhim, and takes his picture. Shiny new research centers are<br />\nbuilt for his benefit. Hopkins was made for him, just as<br />\nEden was made for that snakey little devil named Satan.<br />\nSo it's not such a big mystery why some old lady, upon<br />\nhearing where you partake your education, should tell<br />\nyou about the periodic spasms she gets between her toes.<br /><br />\nY<br /><br />\n4C<br /><br />\nI don't seriously mean to paint a negative picture of all<br />\npre-med students. In fact, I'm told that most of them are<br />\nindeed capable of normal motor functions, such as<br />\nwalking, waving hello, and licking envelopes. Nevertheless,<br />\npoking fun at this motley bunch of future golf amateurs is<br />\na time-honored Homewood tradition.<br />\nIn 1935, Dr. John Rathbone Oliver,a professor of biology<br />\nat Hopkins, wrote a book which boasted the pithy title,<br />\nThe Ordinary Problems of Everyday People. (Those<br />\nsuspicious souls who question my ability to tell the truth<br />\ncan find this book in the Eisenhower Library, call number<br />\nBJ 1581 .0 48.) Sounding like a cross between Mr. Chips<br />\nand Joyce Brothers, Dr. Oliver comments upon the youth<br />\nof Depression America and such topics as sex, hygiene,<br />\nand education. Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the<br />\none called, \"Pre-Medical.\" I quote directly from the good<br />\ndoctor's text:<br />\n\"Nowadays if a man wants to become a physician, he<br />\nhas to begin being one in his freshman year. And for the<br />\nnext four years he is - God save the mark! - 'pre-med.'<br />\nThis means that his courses are more or less prescribed all of them are science courses, with perhaps one language<br />\ncourse thrown in - biology, inorganic and organic<br />\nchemistry, physics, comparative anatomy. He gets no<br />\ngeneral cultivation in Litterae Humaniores. He does not<br />\neven know what they mean... His mind is a mass of<br />\nformulae, filled with test tubes and notes on experiments,<br />\nwith plans of pig embryos and the epigenetic intricacies of<br />\nthe frog...<br />\n\"Year by year I watch the 'pre-med' develop. By the<br />\ntime he has completed the courses which are absolutely<br />\nnecessary for him if he is to gain admission to any good<br />\nmedical school, he is science-fed and bred. He knows<br />\nnothing else. He has been shown nothing else. He has<br />\ninscrutable whims and laws? Are we, fellow non-science<br />\nbecome the grossest of gross materialists, to whom<br />\nmajors,\"the inferior ones\"?<br />\nanything beyond the reach of his senses, his microscope,<br />\nAs Mona Lisa said to Leonardo, \"Don't make Inc<br />\nand his Bunsen burner is riot only anathema, but also<br />\nlaugh!\"<br />\nutterly incomprehensible...<br />\nBesides, we mean no harm when we make the \"throat\"<br />\n\"Many misguided youths who want to study medicine \u2022 the butt of our good-natured scorn. We're only joking,<br />\nimagine that if they come to Hopkins for four years of<br />\nright? By the way, why did the pre-med cross the road?<br />\nundergraduate work, they will be sure of admission to the<br />\nBecause it was required.<br />\nI don't suppose pre-meds tell Art History major jokes,<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical School. Alas for many 'pre-med'<br />\nor International Studies major jokes, or English major<br />\ndisappointments!...<br />\njokes. I wouldn't mind if they did. After all, fair is fair.<br />\n\"The persistence of the 'pre-med' in search of a medical<br />\nBut, if such jokes existed, they would most likely lack the<br />\nschool is remarkable. If he finds no American school<br />\nmirthful malice of our barbs at pre-meds. They'd<br />\nwilling to take him, he will pack up and go abroad. This<br />\nprobably be like Toronto Blue Jay jokes: sad, pointless,<br />\ncontinually increasing stream of medical students who<br />\nyes, cruel. I also don't suppose that someday,<br />\nand,<br />\nwho<br />\nseek<br />\na medical<br />\nhave been rejected at home and<br />\noutfitted again in a Hopkins t-shirt, I'll be accosted by a<br />\neducation all the way from London and Edinburgh to<br />\nrabid tweed\u2014bedecked loon begging me on his hands and<br />\nCzechoslovakia and Soviet Russia proves clearly that there<br />\nknees to compare Shakespeare and Marlowe for him.<br />\nare more 'pre-meds' than there are places in our medical<br />\nschools.\"<br />\nSome things never change, do they?<br />\nDr. Oliver adds in a later paragraph, \"I do my best in<br />\nIt might be fitting, and a nice gesture to boot, to close<br />\nmy lectures, when I am talking about medicine as a career<br />\nwith some complimentary remarks on our friend, the<br />\npre-med. But if you think I'm going to be the one to<br />\nand the mental traits that go into the making of a good<br />\nmake them, you're crazy. Take it away, Doc Oliver:<br />\nphysician, to emphasize the length of medical training,<br />\n\"By and large. the pre-medical student, as I have<br />\nthe slowness of advancement, the lack of any very great<br />\nknown him, is a very decent sort. He may have no liking<br />\nfinancial reward.\" In the Library's copy of the- book,<br />\nfor English verse, he may know nothing about art and less<br />\nsome outraged reader underlined \"lack of any very great<br />\nabout music, he may, so far as the Litterae Humaniores<br />\nfinancial reward,\" and scribbled in the margin, \"Is he<br />\nare concerned, be an utter barbarian. But he has his good<br />\nkidding?\"<br />\npoints. He will spend happy hours with the lowest forms<br />\nof life, with animalculae and single cells... The 'pre-med' is<br />\ngoing to be a doctor. The mere idea is enough to set him<br />\nMaybe we mock pre-meds for the same reasons anyone<br />\nalbeit<br />\nfar above other men. And so I like him. I think I might<br />\nrealization,<br />\nthe<br />\nawe,<br />\nfear,<br />\nmockery:<br />\nresorts to<br />\nalmost love him if he did not insist on dissecting dead cats<br />\nsubconscious, that we are the inferior ones.

Here's a brief (yet helpful)<br />\nglossary to assist you in finding your type and those of<br />\nyour fellow \"animals.\" \u2022<br />\nBeautifid People: the socialites who hang around the bar,<br />\nbeer in hand, watching the dancers, and engaging in trite<br />\nyet witty one-liners.<br />\nDamies: generally: distinguished by their<br />\njeans chic; a little ,L o o \"normal\" for the Hopkins<br />\ncrowd; like Dr. Pepper, so misunderstood.<br />\nFrat Brothers: that menagerie of ATO and TEP beasties<br />\nwhich specializes in pick-ups, power ploys, partying, and<br />\nclose encounters of the Animal House kind.<br />\nGoucherettes: (see PREPPY)these nymphettes arrive clad<br />\nin docksiders, khakis, and the inevitable sweater around<br />\nthe neck; the real thing can also be spotted wearing an<br />\nobvious amount of make-up, with a center part and<br />\nfrosted wings in her medium-length hair.<br />\nHopkins Girls: reputedly hard to get into the sack - and<br />\neven harder to get rid of once there.<br />\nNerds: arrive from Hutzler on the 10:32 and depart<br />\npromptly on the 11:32; some go to watch the tube,<br />\nothers to display their beer-guzzling prowess to the other<br />\nnerds; they don't dance, loiter around the bar area, or<br />\ncreate a disturbance; quite harmless - except when exam<br />\ntime rolls around.<br />\nPseudo-Disco Kings: there to strut their stuff; wear silk<br />\nshirts; constantly popping aspirin to lower their disco<br />\nfever; actually, they're Long Island Dance Studio<br />\ndrop-outs.<br />\nAnd then there's everyone else.<br />\nSo what does \"every one else\" do? \"Every one\" comes to<br />\nthe Rat to meet people, but not everyone has the nerve to<br />\ntake that risky first move. So they come. And watch.<br />\nOn Thursday nights the Rat's back rooms are crowded<br />\nwith groups of three or four guys staring at their pitcher<br />\nof brew, sizing up a nymphette or two, and then returning<br />\nto the beer. \"C'mon, Steve, get up and talk to her. I think<br />\nshe's looking at you.\" But before Steve can discern<br />\nwhether the girl is really looking at him, he glances one<br />\nlast time at the beer. And then - she has disappeared. But<br />\nthe pitcher remains, old faithful friend. Many Ratgoers<br />\nare like this: wishing they could find someone and give up<br />\nthe Watching life but, at the same time, too afraid to<br />\ndetach themselves from the womb's safe stupor.<br />\nBut Watchers are not only male. Our fellow females often<br />\ncluster in three's and four's wondering whether they have<br />\ncaught the eye of any of the guys. \"I can't eat any more<br />\nof this pizza.\" \"OK, so leave it. Maybe we'll eat it later.\"<br />\nBut the night drags on, and they stop talking and start<br />\nlooking at their watches. \"My necklace isn't twisted, is<br />\nit?\"No, I don't think so.\" \"Oh.\"<br />\nBut not everyone takes Thursday night at the Rat sitting<br />\ndown. Clumps of fraternity brothers cluster in the<br />\nbackrooms grunting, pushing, and proving to everyone<br />\nthat they are enjoying themselves the way real men do.<br />\nSome of the bolder ones clog the passages from room to<br />\nroom actively ogling the occasional unattached female<br />\npassing through. \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" She disappears into the<br />\ncrowd.\"What a piece.\" \"Nice tits.\"<br />\nSimilar Watchers lounge around the periphery of the<br />\nance floor or near the bar. One girl is leanin against a<br /><br />\npole with a pleasantly bored expression on her face. \"Hi,<br />\nhow are you?\" asks an acquaintance. \"OK.\" \"Are you<br />\nhaving a good time?\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" with that<br />\nfatigued smile Watchers often wear.<br />\nNaturally, not everyone who goes to the Rat is a watcher.<br />\nIf this were true, the place could not have come by its<br />\nreputation as a meat market so easily. Apparently, some<br />\npeople take risks.<br />\nHe glances at her, and she doesn't look away. Could it<br />\nbe? Could this night be a little less lonely than the last?<br />\n(guy approaches girl, seated alone)<br />\nHe: Mind if I join you? (cute ass; probably a Goucher girl;<br />\nbut why is she alone?)<br />\nShe: No, go right ahead. (I hope this guy doesn't leave as<br />\nsoon as the last one did.)<br />\nHe: where do you go to school? (What a boring question.)<br />\nShe: Goucher. (I hope he hasn't pre-judged me by now.)<br />\nHe: Do you come here often?(God, it's hot in here.)<br />\nShe: Not really.(Where the hell else would I go?)<br />\nHe: What's your major? (This is beginning to sound like<br />\nTwenty Questions.)<br />\nShe: English. (I should have said drama; it sound more<br />\nexotic)<br />\nHe: Oh, yeah? What year are you in? (I hope she's a<br />\nfreshman, it'll be so much easier if she is)<br />\nShe: Soph. How about -you? (I bet he hopes I was a<br />\nfreshman. He probably can't think of anything else to<br />\nsay.)<br /><br />\nHe. Junior. (I hope she doesn't want to talk all evening.)<br />\nSILENCE<br />\nHe: Like disco music? (I hope it looks like I have better<br />\ntaste in music than that!)<br />\nShe: Not really - although it's great for dancing. (I hope<br />\nhe doesn't ask me to dance. I always get twisted up.)<br />\nHe: Wanna dance? (Why don't they ever play anything<br />\nslow?)<br />\nShe: Well.., why don't we talk a while'? (On closer<br />\ninspection, he's not as cute as I thought.)<br />\nHe: (Jesus, a conversation with her! Mission Impossible!)<br />\nWould you like something to drink? (I've got lotsa stuff in<br />\nWolman - if I can get her there.)<br />\nShe: Sure.(Maybe I should get out of this before it's too<br />\nlate.)<br />\nHe: Do you like beer? Or I could get a pitcher of Sangria?<br />\n(Hopefully, the bar will be crowded, and we'll have to go<br />\nsomewhere else.)<br />\nShe: Sounds great - the Sangria, that is. (I wonder what<br />\nI'm getting myself into.)<br />\nHe: Wanta come on up to the bar? (I can't lose her now.)<br />\nShe: Ok. (Too late to turn back. I may as well - why<br />\nnot?)<br />\nMaybe the problem with disco night is that the players<br />\nbecome entangled in their own elaborate games. What if<br /><br />\neveryone were honest?<br />\nPerson 1: Hey, you're cute. Would you like to make it<br />\nwith me tonight?<br />\nPerson 2: Well, give me a few minutes to think it over.<br />\nHMMMM...You're not bad looking, but I have a lot of<br />\nwork to do tomorrow, and I don't want to spend the<br />\nwhole day catching up on my sleep.<br />\nPerson 1: Sure, I understand. How about a quick lay - an<br />\nhour, tops - and then you can go home and get some rest?<br />\nPerson 2: Good idea. Your place or mine?<br />\nAt disco night guys are expected to assume the awesome<br />\nburden of the first move. But what if it were the other<br />\nway around?<br />\nShe: Hi.<br />\nHe: Hello.<br />\nShe Come here often?<br />\nHe Occasionally.<br />\nShe: What's your major?<br />\nHe: Psych.<br />\nShe: Oh? I'm in Natural Science.<br />\nHe: You mean you're a pre-med?<br />\nShe: Well, I'm not sure yet. I've only applied to twelvemedical schools so far.<br />\nHe: You're a senior?<br />\nShe: Yeah. How about you?<br />\nHe: I'm a freshman.<br />\nShe: Can I get you a beer'?<br />\nHe: No thanks I don't drink.<br />\nShe: Well, it's kind of hot in here. Let's go outside.<br />\nHe: Oh, I just remembered that I have to look for my<br />\nfriend. I'll be right back.<br />\nShe: Burned again.<br />\nOne of the major causes of the Rat's comm ni cation<br />\nbreakdown is the noise. The music is intentionally loud<br />\nenough to drown out all but the most hardy conversation<br />\nand drive the more complex verbiage onto the back room<br />\ntables where more subtle games can be enjoyed. Yet on<br />\nthe dance floor words are unnecessary. Body langirige<br />\nsays it all. Below, a typical dance floor conversation:<br />\nHe: Do you wanna dance?<br />\nShe: What?<br />\nHe: I said: DO YOU WANNA DANCE?<br />\nShe: Sure.<br />\nHe: What?<br />\nShe OK!!<br />\nHe: Bump<br />\nShe:Grind<br />\nHe: BumpGrind<br />\nShe: GrindBump<br />\nHe: BumpBumpgriiind....<br />\nShe: GrindBuMPbummbummbummP<br />\nHe: BumpgrINDind bumpbumpbumpGRIND!!!<br />\nShe: GrindbUMPumpgrindgrindgrindBUMP!!!<br />\nHe: You dance well.<br />\nShe What?<br />\nHe: Do you wanna take a walk outside?<br />\nShe Let's go outside. I can't hear you.<br />\nAll fairy tales have morals - even this one.<br />\nQ: Let's sit down and talk. What can we do about the<br />\nRat? I mean, how can we create an atmosphere that<br />\nallows people to communicate instead of play games?<br />\nA: Is this some kind of interview?<br />\nQ: well, yes....<br />\nA: Ok. I would say that the Rat should be torn down and<br />\na bright, beautiful, well-lit horticultural garden be put in<br />\nits place. Only then could men and women truly know<br />\neach other as friends and fulfill each other's emotional,<br />\nintellectual, and spiritual needs.<br />\nQ: I'm sorry, but this music is so loud that I couLlet heal<br />\nyou. Do you want to talk outside? (Pretty girl; will go<br />\nwell with my apartment.)<br />\nA: I'd really like to, but I have to look for my friend...<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 I OCTOBER 20, 1978<br /><br />\nTHE INQUIRING<br />\nPHOTOGRAPHER<br /><br />\nScience marches on....<br /><br />\non the J.H.U. campus, which one<br /><br />\nElectron Scope<br />\nReveals World<br />\nInside Atoms<br /><br />\nwould you choose, and why?<br /><br />\nBY PAUL A.

It is<br />\nthe Biophysics Department's Scanning Transmission<br />\nElectron Microscope, one of only three in the country<br />\nwith similar capabilities. Entering the small office where<br />\nits gleaming stainless steel cylinders and attendant<br />\nelectronic equipment are kept, one is surrounded by<br />\nimages of a new world -- a world which only a few years<br />\nago existed only in theory and metaphor; a world of<br />\nDNA molecules, mercury atoms, and atomic motions.<br />\nBuilt between 1971 and 1974 on a proposal by<br />\nDepartment Chairman Michael Beer and a grant from the<br />\nNational Institute of Health, the microscope differs from<br />\nother electron microscopes in that it scans its specimens<br />\nwith a concentrated electron beam. A picture is put<br />\ntogether much as in a television camera; only then it is<br />\nreduced to a set of mathematical data bits which can be<br />\nmanipulated by a computer. More conventional electron<br />\nmicroscopes work much like light microscopes, focusing<br />\nelctron beams with electromagnetic \"lenses.\"<br />\nAs Dr. Wendell Wiggins, the instrument's overseer,<br />\nstates, \"It's more complicated to build an image this<br />\nway.\" But for many reasons, it's worth it. One has more<br />\ncontrol over the electrons interacting with the specimen.<br />\nThere is no need to mechanically \"focus\" the electrons<br />\ninto an image. Other advantages arise from some of<br />\nelectron microscopy's more nagging problems.<br />\nUnlike most images formed by light microscopes, the<br />\nelectron<br />\nmicroscope image requires abstract<br />\nintellectualization to understand. Just like trying to learn<br />\nsomething about a golf ball in a dark room by firing<br />\nbeebees at it, it is hard to tell how much of what one<br />\n\"sees\" is the direct result of the \"looking.\" \"There is<br />\ngreat difficulty in interpreting the images,\" comments<br />\nWiggins. \"They don't do much for you to just look at<br />\nthem.\" For clarification, a compact and efficient PDP-11<br />\ncomputer is used to manipulate the picture data until<br />\nuseful pictures can be printed from it. Much the same<br />\nkind of operation is used in processing the pictures from<br />\nthe Mars probes.<br />\nWhen the machine started reliable operation in 1976,<br />\nthe theoretical lower limit of the microscope's seeing<br />\npower was rated at 3 angstroms, or about the size of<br />\nlarger atoms. Presently, only images about nine times that<br />\nsize can be clearly discerned due to the fact that, unlike<br />\natoms firmly attached to a larger molecule, most atoms<br />\n\"just don't stay put\" while one is looking at them. This<br />\nhas been a major problem in protein and DNA research<br />\nwhere it is important to know the positions of artificially<br />\nattached, highly visible heavy element atoms in order to<br />\ndeduce structure. Soon, however, a liquid helium stage<br />\naddition will allow researchers to \"freeze\" all molecular<br />\nmotion and see the hitherto unseeable. When the addition<br />\nis finished, the Hopkins microscope, with this thermal<br />\n\"stop-action\" capability, will be unique in the country.<br />\nIn the meantime, studying such problems as the<br />\ninteraction of proteins with chromosome constituents<br />\nwhere the movement problem is not as crucial, Wiggins<br />\nand other are pushing back the frontiers of knowledge to<br />\nuncover such possibilities as the cure of congenital<br />\ndiseases, and the design, modification, and possibly even<br />\nthe creation of life. Currently funded by both the<br />\nNational Institute of Health and the National Science<br />\nFoundation, the instrument's overseers are just now<br />\nproposing \"large scale collaboration\" with other<br />\ndepartments, labs and institutions which would extend<br />\nthe microscope's usefulness beyond the confines of the<br />\nBiophysics Department. One can only guess at the<br />\npossibilities from there.<br />\nMeanwhile, the day-to-day challenges will go on for<br />\nresearchers toiling in the musty obscurity of that Latrobe<br />\nHall basement. Of the typical tribulations, Wiggins, with a<br />\nknowing smile, relates the following story: \"(Sometimes)<br />\nwe've had an image which we didn't think much of, but<br />\nafter digesting it awhile began to appreciate it; or, on the<br />\nother hand, thought it was marvelous until we thought<br />\nabout it awhile and discovered it wasn't so hot after all.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br /><br />\n7000 TIMES!<br />\nIF YOU'VE SAID IT ONCE,<br />\nYOU'VE SAID IT 7000 TIMES<br />\nIN THE HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nFOR INFORMATION ON<br />\nADVERTISING, CALL 338-7647 ON<br />\nTUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY, 1 TO 5 PM<br />\nAND ASK FOR PHIL OR ELLIOT.<br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nINTERNATIONAL<br />\nCAREER?<br /><br />\nNews Letter<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events presents<br /><br />\nA Lecture/Workshop<br />\nAREAS<br /><br />\nFiNEST<br />\nA representative<br />\nwill be on the campus<br />\nMONDAY<br />\nOCTOBER 23, 1978<br />\nto discuss qualifications for<br />\nadvanced study at<br />\nAMERICAN<br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL<br />\nand job opportunities<br />\nin the field of<br /><br />\nhAIRCUTTINq<br />\nby<br /><br />\nROSE gOicIMAN<br />\nNAThEWiTCIII<br /><br />\nbENNy<br /><br />\nEitEEN<br /><br />\n3333<br /><br />\nqwird<br /><br />\nN.

When I decided to join<br />\nthe Hulabaloo staff in Feb. 1978<br />\nthe yearbook was almost dead.<br />\nFrom what I gathered then there<br />\nhadn't been a meeting of the<br />\nstaff in months. I met Bill<br />\nLaufer, Dogna Skoog, Dave<br />\nFryburg and some business staff<br />\nindividually. I was informed that<br />\nsome deadlines had already gone<br />\nby and none had been met. I<br />\npleaded with the editors to call a<br />\nmeeting of the entire staff and<br />\nperhaps get the ball rolling. Bill<br /><br />\nLau fe.r and Dogna Skoog<br />\neventually agreed to a time and<br />\nplace. Only Skoog, Fryburg, a<br />\nfew photographers and I showed<br />\nup. Skoog assured me that there<br />\nwas a layout staff, but until June<br />\nI only heard names and never saw<br />\none of their faces. At this<br />\nmeeting, I informed Skoog that I<br />\nwould join the staff to help with<br />\nthe photography. At no time was<br />\nI photography editor. I agreed to<br />\npick up film from the<br />\nphotography store, distribute and<br />\ncollect finished work from the<br />\nother photographers, and shoot<br />\nsome pictures myself.<br />\nSubsequently, I went to the<br />\nyearbook darkroom and found it<br />\nin shambles, and proceeded to<br />\nstraighten it up. I acquired<br />\npermission from the editors and<br />\nthe business staff to stock the<br />\ndarkroom with film, chemicals,<br />\nand a few basic tools. The total<br />\namount I spent and signed for<br />\nwas approximately $110.<br />\nContact sheets of photographs<br />\nwere given to Laufer but were<br />\nnever returned marked \"For<br />\nprinting\".<br />\nThe yearbook had another<br />\nchance but Laufer and Skoog<br />\nfailed to take advantage of it.<br />\nLate in February, a freelance<br />\nphotographer of the Freshman<br />\nclass showed me almost a<br />\nthousand of his personal<br /><br />\nnegatives covering all the events<br />\nof the university since Freshman<br />\norientation. The Freelance<br />\nphotographer told me he would<br />\nprint up any of the negatives the<br />\nyearbook wanted in the now<br />\nrefurbished darkroom. The .<br />\ncopies of all these negatives<br />\n(contact sheets) were shown to<br />\nLaufer shortly after. Laufer told<br />\nme that the layout staff would go<br />\nover the contact sheets, mark the<br />\nsuitable shots \"For printing\"<br />\nreturn them to me. It was the<br />\nend of May and neither Laufer<br />\nnor the so-called layout staff had<br />\nreviewed any of the available<br />\nphotographs. Luafer had almost<br />\n1000 pictures available to him<br />\nand did nothing. With no pictures<br />\nbeing examined by Laufer and<br />\nmarked \"For printing\" by the<br />\nend of May, I decided none<br />\nwould ever be forthcoming. The<br />\nFreelance photographer left with<br />\nhis negatives. The developing<br />\nequipment was left in the<br />\ndarkroom.

The forms we do have, we have borrowed<br />\nfrom our Europeanforebears, misshapen them to fit our<br />\noft-times profane American style, and vulgarized them by<br />\nour excessive wealth till they have become devoid of the<br />\nawe and feeling that such rituals should have.<br />\nOur failure to bring this chaos into a cohesive order is<br />\nthe theme of Robert Altman's latest movie,\"A Wedding.'<br />\nAltman has discovered a formula for making serious films<br />\nthat also do well at the box office. This has given almost<br />\nunlimited license to direct whatever he chooses, free from<br />\nthe normal limitations that restrict most commercial<br />\nmovie.making enterprises. At the same time, he is able to<br />\nattract top notch actors and actresses interested in making<br />\nserious cinema.<br />\n\"A Wedding\" continues in the tradition of the<br />\nwide-eyed criticism of American society that Altman did<br />\nso successfully in \"Nashville.\" Both are organized along<br />\nthe same basic set of principles; a certain paradigm is<br />\nchosen and scrupulously examined as a microcosm of the<br />\nsociety it inhabits. In \"Nashville,\" it was that pop capital<br />\nof American country music; in this movie, it is the<br />\nceremony and reception of a present day Midwestern<br />\nwedding.<br />\nThe ceremony takes place in a majestic, expansive<br />\ncathedral with beautifully crafted mahogany pews and<br />\nstunning blue imported stained glass windows presided<br />\nover by a doddering bishop in full red vestments. The<br />\npredicament is immediately apparent as the camera<br />\nintroduces us to the two families: on one side are the<br />\nred-headed, pale-skinned WASPs-- the bride Muffin(Amy<br />\nStryker); her younger sister, Buffy (Mia Farrow); their<br />\nmother, Tulip (Carol Burnett)-- and on the other side are<br />\nthe dark haired, swarthy-skinned Italian Catholics-- the<br />\ngroom Dino (Desi Arnaz, Jr.), and his father (Vittorio<br />\nGassman).Together they re-enact the archtypical<br />\nAmerican ritual, the melding together of the races.<br />\nThe tension in the movie, both dramatic and comic,<br />\nresults from the fact that now, as a two hundred year-old<br />\nnation, we finally have the means to create form and<br />\nstructure around our lives, but we are no longer<br />\ninterested. Geraldine Chaplin, as a kind of hired mistress<br />\nof ceremonies and guardian of non-existing traditions, is<br />\nconstantly being subverted in her efforts to impose order<br />\non this happy chaos.<br />\nFor example, the wedding present table is filled with<br />\ngifts of elegant porcelain, complete sets of lead crystal.<br /><br />\nDevo<br /><br />\nSeven Beauties<br /><br />\nPeter Gabriel<br /><br />\n-.01\u202211111114<br /><br />\nand silver candelabras. Yet the tableaux is ruined as some<br />\neccentric socialist Aunt unveils her gift to the bride- a full<br />\nsized portrait of the bride standing topless against a<br />\nbackground of smoke-stacked factories. Another time,<br />\nChaplin corrals all the young unmarrieds around the<br />\nstaircase for the tossing of the bouquet. She carefully<br />\nleads Muffin up the stairs, stops her halfway, and instructs<br />\nher to toss the flowers. Down below, the vestal virgins<br />\nplay hot potato with it- none relishing the role of being<br />\nthe next to take her vows while giving up her precious<br />\nfreedom- till it falls innocuously into the hands of Lauren<br />\nHutton, who heads the movie team that is filming the<br />\nwhole affair.<br />\nNot only is the form of the wedding being subverted,<br />\nbut its substance as well. The American system of pairing,<br />\nwhat Professor Money terms the Virgin Bride and the<br />\nDouble Standard, is no longer adequate to contain our<br />\never wandering passions. Before long, we learn that the<br />\ngroom may have impregnated his wife's younger sister<br />\nBuffy, only to find that Buffy has been to bed with no<br />\nfewer than twenty other men in recent months. Buffy<br />\nspeaks very little during the movie, but wears a sly<br />\nover-satiated grin that tells all. Chaplin cannotcontain her<br />\npassion for the bride. Even the bride's mother gets into<br />\nthe action, succumbing to the insipid attestations of love<br /><br />\nfrom an obese but lovable member (Pat McCormack) of<br />\nthe groom's family.<br />\nThe failure to perceive forms soon degrades into a<br />\nfailure to perceive reality. When the matriarchal figure<br />\n(Lillian Gish) who presides in Faulkneresque fashion as<br />\nDowager Queen over the whole household dies, she<br />\ncontinues to reign. People come in, congratulate her, and<br />\nask her advice about the arrangements- all after she has<br />\npassed away. No one seems to notice. No one seems to<br />\ncare. When someone finally discovers she is dead, they are<br />\ndumbfounded. What do you say? How do you tell the<br />\nfamily? These questions prove to be just too perplexing<br />\nand the decision is made to say nothing at all, while the<br />\nneurotic nurse is given the job of keeping up appearances.<br />\nOnly through the whispering channels of gossip does word<br />\nof her death leak out, and then it spreads like wildfire. So<br />\nwhen one of the sisters gathers the family together in one<br />\nroom to tell them the tragic news,,not one person there<br />\nhasn't already heard. When it is all over, they shake her<br />\nhand and congratulate her on the fine job she has done.<br />\nWealth, as the American solution to all problems, goes<br />\nfar to cover up these imperfections but it too ultimately<br />\nsubverts itself. Everyone is beautifully dressed; the<br />\ngroom's house is decorated with lush peach satins and<br />\nCont. on p. 21<br /><br />\n61 1?tertaiimept<br />\n'<br /><br />\nThe Sex Pistols<br />\nSwept Away<br /><br />\nJulia<br /><br />\nA Wedding<br /><br />\n'Julia'Examines The Complexity<br />\nOfHuman Relationships<br />\nBY DAVID KAPLAN<br />\nDisaster has a markedimpact on all human relationships.<br />\nWhat may have seemed a strong friendship rapidly<br />\ndetenorates in the face of uncontrollable outside crises;<br />\nor, more fortunately, alignments may grow and<br />\nstrengthen as both persons discover that mutual comfort<br />\nand assistance is an easier way to face catastrophe.<br />\n\"Julia\", which will be playing on October 21st and 22nd<br />\nin Shriver Hal; explores how war and a diseased world<br />\neffects so profoundly the relationship between two very<br />\nremarkable women: Lillian Hellman,portrayed by Jane<br />\nFonda, and her friend Julia, played by Vanessa Redgrave.<br />\nOn the surface, \"Julia' is a rather uncomplicated if<br />\nunsettling story (unsettling perhaps because it is a true<br />\nstoiy by Lillian Hellman). It chronicles the evolution of<br />\nLillian's and Julia's friendship, from their childhood<br />\nonward. The main body of the film, however, takes place<br />\nin 1930's Europe as Lillian tries to discover what has<br />\nhappened to Julia, who is working for the German<br />\nunderground. The fact that Lillian persists in the face of<br />\nunsympathetic guards, incomprehensible telephone<br />\noperators, and increasingly suspicious authorities is a<br /><br />\nbeautiful example of how friendship can and does<br />\novercome those things which seek to destroy it. Julia is<br />\nfinally able to communicate with Lillian through an agent<br />\nof the anti-Fascism movement. She attempts to enlist<br />\nLillian's participation in a scheme to smuggle a great<br />\namount of money into Geimany, and Lillian finally agrees<br />\nto undertake the dangerous mission of transporting<br />\nmoney to Berlin en route to the Soviet Union.<br />\nThat, for the most part, is the plot of the film. But<br />\n\"Julia\" did not win three Academy Awards on the basis<br />\nof its plot. The true story lies in the development of the<br />\nmain characters and in the conflicts that repeatedly<br />\nconfront them. The decisions which must be made are not<br />\nsimple. Lillian recognizes that in order to accord with her<br />\nprinciples, she must help the German underground. But<br />\nher feelings of social justice and her feeling of loyalty to<br />\nboth Julia and her ideals do not rest easily with her own<br />\nentirely understandable fears. It would be all too easy to<br />\nbask in her emerging success as a playwright and to ignore<br />\nwhat is happening in Europe. Lillian knows this-- still, she<br />\nhesitates, as any person would. What is best about the<br />\nfilm is that the characters are people, and I believe that it<br />\nreaches its peak when one can see the play of these<br />\nclashing emotions in the expressions of the characters.<br /><br />\nVanessa Redgrave and Jane Fonda in Julia<br />\nThe world of \"Julia\" is indeed a threatening one, and<br />\nthe film seeks to remind you of that fact over and over<br />\nagain. Scenes of mass riots, stills of Nazi rallies, and the<br />\never present police have a definite purpose- for \"Julia\" is<br />\nnot only a story of love but also a story of hatred and<br />\nterror. This is highlighted by the eerie calm and lack of<br />\nconcern in many of the other scenes. The movie begins<br />\nand ends in the quiet of a lake and the story starts with<br />\nLillian writing, or struggling to write, a play in a cottage<br />\nCont. on p. 20<br /><br />\nillustration by Lisa Kay Pease<br /><br />\nWe lined up civilly according<br />\nto the time we had arrived. First<br />\nin line was 10:15, followed by<br />\n10:32 -- he had a friend. Then<br />\ncame 11:08, two guys at 11:42<br />\nand two girls at 11:54 -- one was<br />\npretty, the other was not. I was<br />\nnext at 2:13, and behind me<br />\ncame several more. We were the BY STEPHEN BARR<br />\ndie-hards, the devoted, the ones<br />\nwho would do anything -- even if<br />\nthat meant waiting over 70<br />\ncombined hours in front of<br />\nRecordmasters at the Rotunda<br />\nlast Friday (the 13th) to get<br />\ntickets for the Peter Gabriel<br />\nconcert.<br />\nI had heard stories and seen<br />\nnews reels of tne lines that<br />\nencircle Madison Square Garden<br />\nann other such arenas prior to<br />\nthe sale of concert tickets -Zeppelin in '72, Dylan in '75,<br />\nSpringsteen in '78. I was aware of<br />\nthose who camp out in line, days<br />\nin advance, to ensure themselves<br />\na ticket to some momentous concert. And just that day<br />\n(the 13th), I had heard on the radio of the record sell-out<br />\nfor Springsteen at the Capitol Centre. So it wasn't too<br />\ndifficult to see the Beckettian absurdity of our situation;<br />\n12 or so people \"camped out,\" waiting for the arrival of<br />\nsome unknown man with the tickets that would allow us<br />\nto see Gabriel.<br />\nWhether the concert was even going to happen was<br />\noften in question. First it was on, and the word spread<br />\nfast. Then it was off, then on again. The new word was<br />\nthat tickets would go on sale at noon on Friday (the<br />\n13th) at selected Baltimore record stores. I called ,<br />\nRecordmasters numerous times Thursday and Friday<br />\nmorning: their word was, \"We will be selling tickets, they<br />\naren't in yet.\" I was told when I called at 1:30 that if the<br />\nman did not show, there was the possibility of a riot. At<br />\nthat point, I decided I better get my ass in gear, get down<br />\nto the store, and wait in line like all the rest if I really<br />\nwanted tickets.<br />\nI entered the store. The potentially riotous crowd<br />\nnumbered 10, lined casually and quietly in front of the<br />\ncash register, leaning on record racks, record boxes and<br />\nanything else they could find. I tried to figure out which<br />\nend was the end; no one objected when I joined the one<br /><br />\nWAITING FOR<br />\nGABRIEL<br /><br />\nThe Sex Pistols<br />\nStill Firing Away<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 19<br />\neverything we were told was true<br />\nwas later countered by something<br />\ndifferent. At 4:00 we learned the<br />\nCivic Center was sold out; at<br />\n5:00, the line had formed around<br />\nthe building and there were no<br />\ntickets -- yet. The most<br />\ndevastating word came at 5:30<br />\nwhen two girls told us the whole<br />\nthing was a farce. That was the<br />\nlast thing we wanted to hear, at<br />\nthat hour, when several of us<br />\nwere questioning whether it<br />\nwould be worthwhile to continue<br />\nto wait.<br />\nAround 6:00, many were<br />\nbeginning to give up hope. The<br />\nstore would remain open until<br />\n9:00, but some had been waiting<br />\nalmost eight hours, and the pain<br />\nwas getting to be too much.<br />\nWhen we tried to sit down<br />\noutside the store, a security<br />\nguard told us we had to stand. He<br />\ndidn't mind us loitering around<br />\nthe entrance to Recordmasters,<br />\nbut he didn't want us to sit. One member of the 10:32<br />\nduo had to go somewhere, and he was replaced by a<br />\nfriend. A couple who had arrived later than I couldn't<br />\nwait any longer, so they gave their money and number to<br />\na perfect stranger who also was wiating for tickets. As<br />\ndusk fell, we crowded closer to the entrance, as if we were<br />\nexpecting some word from within. Passers-by would look<br />\nover our shoulders to see what was happening, and<br />\ncustomers would ask our permission to enter.<br />\nI had made two phone calls to the friend with whom I<br />\nwas to attend the concert -- I wanted to tell her how I was<br />\nsuffering -- but both times she wasn't home. At 6:20, I<br />\nthought it was time to try again. I went into the store for<br />\nchange, and before I left I felt compelled to ask for news<br />\nin case they were hiding anything from us. I was calmly<br />\ninformed the small rotund man in the red cardigan and<br />\nchecked pants was the man with the tickets. It was 6:27. I<br />\nput the change in my pocket as I took out the bills. Then,<br />\nI went to tell the others the news. The man was so<br />\nunassuming he had slipped by all of us without even a<br />\nhint of suspicion. Nevertheless, he had the tickets.<br />\nIt was 6:43. I was in posession of two tickets to the<br />\nPeter Gabriel concert at the Lyric Theatre on October<br />\n\u2022<br />\n26th. Hope lives on forever!<br /><br />\nnearest the door. They greeted me politely and told me<br />\nthe current news. Then they graciously turned back to<br />\ntheir friends, books or prior acquaintances to continue<br />\ntheir methods of killing time. No one was disrupting<br />\nanything no one was even distracting or rude as we let<br />\ncustomers by. We were orderly, waiting for the man with<br />\nthe tickets. Definitely not the stuff riots are made of.<br />\nAt 3:00, we were asked to move our line outside<br />\nbecause the managers felt we were too numerous to loiter<br />\nin their small store. I lingered a moment, and when I<br />\nexited, the others were lined up against the walls on both<br />\nsides of the door. Again, I couldn't figure out which was<br />\nthe end -- and again, no one directed me -- so I flipped a<br />\ncoin to choose which wall to lean against. There we were,<br />\napproximately 12 people with nothing to say and nothing<br />\nto do but .wait for some man who was supposed to be<br />\ndelivering the tickets.<br />\nWhen noon had passed without the man, I had learned<br />\nthat the new ETA was 3:00. That deadline had come and<br />\ngone: now the man was expected to arrive at 6:00.<br />\nRumors began to fly -- we were beginning to feel<br />\nfrustrated and desperate.

He is caught at a<br />\nrather unfortunate moment, but is later released.<br />\nMost of the movie is in a series of long flashbacks; in<br />\nreality, Pasqualino is at the Italian front. After a number<br />\nof brilliant escapades, he and a friend, along with their<br />\nfellow soldiers, are caught by the Germans.<br />\nThe commander of the concentration camp is a typical<br />\nWertmuller female, a huge woman with large, impressive<br />\nbreasts. Pasqualino is able to attract her with his bold and<br />\ndaring exploits. After he asks to be freed, his loyalty is<br />\ntested when he is asked to shoot his friend. After some<br />\nhesitation, Pasqualino does it, creating a turmoil in which<br />\nseveral people die and other prisoners escape. Meanwhile,<br />\nPasqualino is able to have sex with the commander who<br />\noverwhelms him with her huge, obnoxious body, leaving<br />\nhim impotent.<br />\nSeven Beauties may be said to be an introspective<br />\nstudy of man's instinct for survival, at times against<br />\nimpossible odds. Pasqualino displays of this instinct; one<br />\nmust stay alive at all costs, even if one has to abandon<br />\nfriends and values. More importantly, Wertmuller is<br />\n;clearly expressing her disapproval of Social Darwinism. At<br />\nthe same time, she explores other minor themes such as<br />\n;how an organization like the Mafia operates. These other<br />\nI themes have already been dealt with by other prominent<br />\n;<br />\ndirectors, but Wertmuller's approach is quite unique.<br />\nCompared to the bizarre Seven Beauties, Swept Away<br />\nis seemingly simple. Raffaella (Mariangelo Melato) is a<br />\n- lovely female, but a capitalist bitch taking a cruise on the<br />\nMediterranean. Gennarino (Giannini) is a steward on the<br /><br />\ncruise ship. Aboard the ship, Gennarino , a proletarian<br />\npig, is aggravated by the whims and fancies of Raffaella<br />\nwho expects unusual service of him. On an unusually<br />\nsunny day, Raffaella goes out sailing with Gennarino<br />\nattending her boat. Suddenly, the sea turns 'unhealthy' as<br />\nmenacing clouds appear overhead. They are left stranded,<br />\n's away by unusual destiny in the blue sea of Au.' To add<br />\nto the unfortunate crisis, the engine fails, and Raffaella,<br />\nwho keeps pickering on Gennarino for her fate, is left to<br />\nthe complete mercy of the latter, who is far more<br />\nknowledgable about sailing and the geography of the area.<br />\nThus, in the ensuing battle of words, there is a complete<br />\nreversal of roles.<br />\nThe next morning the two land on a deserted island.<br />\nGennarino is accustommed to living in forlorn and hard<br />\ncircumstances, but Raffaella is new to such harsh<br />\nsituations. In a series of humorous and informative shots,<br />\nRaffaella is converted to a virtual slave. Thus, when<br />\nGennarino finally makes love to her, his domination of<br />\nher is complete. However, he is so infatuated by her that<br />\nthe audience is once again left in the midst of a partial<br />\nreversal of roles, leaving both of them as equals.<br />\nAt the moment when they're deeply\"in love with each<br />\nother, a ship appears on the horizon. The two are<br />\ncompelled to play the roles again that destiny set forth<br />\nfor them. Despite all their efforts, Raffaella and<br />\nGennarino are separated. The movie leaves the viewer<br />\nwith a sad expression evoking his sympathy for the<br />\nproletarian Gennarino.<br />\nBesides being a movie essentially about the class<br />\nstruggle, it is also a rather trivial examination of<br />\nEuro-Communism in Italy. Perhaps Wertmuller is saying,<br />\nto quote Dr. Johnson, that eminent man of letters, that<br />\n'very few live by choice. Every man is placed in his<br />\npresent condition by causes which acted without his<br />\nforesight, and with which he did not always willingly<br />\nco-operate.' Male viewers will find Raffaella a bitchy type<br />\nyet incredibly beautiful; female viewers will scoff at the<br />\nreaction of their partners, asserting that her beauty is'<br />\n\u2022<br />\nartificiaE<br /><br />\nCont. from p. t8<br />\non. the shore. Throughout the movie, an essential<br />\ncontradiction emerges as this cloistered, almost artificial<br />\nworld is set against the all too real world in which Julia<br />\nmust live. It is a jarring experience for us and for Lillian,<br />\nwhen she is dragged out of the former life to aid Julia in<br />\nthe latter.<br />\nThe film also does an excellent job in juxtaposing the<br />\npresent world with a series of flashbacks dealing with the<br />\nearly friendship between the young friends. These scenes<br />\nserve to illuminate and to foretell the later story<br />\nThroughout, we see how Julia has acted as a guiding<br />\ninfluence on Lillian-- in dangers both easily and not so<br />\neasily seen. It is she who has contributed more than<br />\nanyone else to Lillian's moral and personal development.<br />\nJust as she had helped to form Lillian's character in those<br />\nearlier days of their relationship, so the continues to exert<br />\na powerful influence even when she is gone.<br />\nTher are other characters within the film, but they are<br />\nonly secondary to this fundamental relayionship. Chief<br />\namong these is mystery writer Dashiell Hammett, played<br />\nby Jason Robards. He, too, has an impact on Lillian as she<br />\ntries to reconcile her love of fame and fortune with her<br />\npersonal values. \"Julia\" is for the most part an excellent<br />\nfilm. It has received many awards and much praise from<br />\ncritics. Its only possible fault is that it tends toward being<br />\noverly sentimental in places. However, most of the scenes<br />\nare done with just the right mixture of ingredients.<br />\nPerhaps, the best part about the story is that it deals with<br />\nthe friendship of two women, a topic not touched upon<br />\nuntil recently, and it does this with a great deal of taste<br />\n\u2022<br />\nand perception.<br /><br />\nGET WELL<br />\nITO LISA H.<br />\nSOON!!!--OHTHE ARTS EDITOR<br /><br />\nLina Wertmuller<br /><br />\nJane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave<br /><br />\n.1\u2022111. .41M00. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022..1111111. .41M<br /><br />\nCOMMUNITY ORGANIZERS<br /><br />\nBadl Brunch Buffet<br />\n1<br />\n1 All you can eat $1.50<br />\nI in the JSA Sukkah<br />\n.<br />\ni<br />\n1 (Behmd Old Dorms)<br />\n1 Sunday, 11:30-1:00 pm<br />\n1<br /><br />\nIIIP<br /><br />\nACORN needs organizers to work with low and moderate<br />\nincome families in 14 states (AR, SD, TX, LA, TN, MO, FL,<br />\nCO, NV, PA, 1A, OK, MI, AZ) for political and economic<br />\njustice.

Nonetheless, the team<br />\ndoctors barred him from practice<br />\nand administered medication to<br />\nget the pressure down.<br />\nCrucial days passed and<br />\nOliver's pressure didn't change.<br />\nThen the red-faced doctors<br />\ndiscovered the source of the<br />\nplayer's \"high blood pressure\".<br />\nSeems Oliver's biceps were too<br />\nbig for a normal sized blood<br />\npressure sleeve, and the tight<br />\ninstrument forced his pressure<br />\nup. 'The doctors found a larger<br />\nsleeve, Oliver's pressure registered<br />\nnormal (it had been normal all<br />\nthe while), he managed to play<br />\nalmost half the game, and the<br />\nRams registered 17-3 over<br />\nBrown.<br /><br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nSports At<br />\nThe N-L<br />\nOn* Wednesday the<br />\nNews-Letter's own Janice 'Jackie<br />\n0.'

The Hopkins passing attack<br />\nwhich proved so effective in last<br />\nweek's fourth quarter<br />\ncome-from-behind victory over<br />\nUrsinus, began to come alive, as<br />\nMargraff connected with<br />\nfreshman Bill Stromberg for the<br />\nfirst Blue Jay score of the<br />\ncontest.<br />\nWidener kept up the scoring<br />\npressure, however, putting<br />\nanother six points on the board<br />\nto cap an eighty-yard drive<br />\nmidway through the second<br />\nperiod, then making the score<br />\n35-6 with the extra point<br />\nconversion. Jeff Harris' 24-yard<br />\nfield goal ended the second half<br /><br />\nas well as the scoring for the rest<br />\nof the day.<br />\nThe second half was largely a<br />\nbattle for position, as the<br />\nHopkins defense solidified and<br />\nheld the visiting champions<br />\nscoreless for the remainder of the<br />\ngame. But the Pioneer defense,<br />\nwhich had given up only 28<br />\npoints prior to meeting the Blue<br />\nJays, also held fast, leaving the<br />\nhalf-time score unchanged.<br />\nTomorrow, the Blue Jays<br />\njourney south to the District of<br />\nColumbia, where they will square<br />\noff against the Hoyas of<br />\nGeorgetown University.
