This<br />\nway, everyone thought, the IFC could at last do things<br />\non a large scale\u2014as made possible by the cooperation of<br />\nall the fraternities in common endeavors.

The show should belong to them;<br />\nbut it won't, if dozens of unescorted girls are on the soccer<br />\nfield, drawing all interest to themselves.<br />\nThe time for cheering and support of the team is at<br />\nthe pep rally; the time for meeting and dating is at the<br />\nmixer following the rally.<br />\n<br />\nA Touch Of The Poet<br />\n<br />\nPlayshop Opens Fortieth Season<br />\nComplex Role<br />\nBy PAUL BERMAN<br />\nwas headed by Joseph<br />\nThe<br />\ncast<br />\nof<br />\none<br />\nA Touch of the Poet,<br />\nas O'Neill's brooding,<br />\nthe manuscript plays of Eugene Bandiera<br />\nhero.

Herkie's father, Walter 0. Nylet, is as everyone knows, president of the First National Artificial Cherry<br />\nCompany, world's largest maker of artificial cherries for ladies'<br />\nhats. Uncle Walter had great plans for Herkie. Last year he<br />\nsent Herkie to the Maryland College of Humanities, Sciences,<br />\nand Artificial Cherries, and he intended, upon Herkie's graduation, to find him a nice fat wife and take him into the firm as<br />\na full partner.<br />\nCould a young man have more pleasing prospects? Of course<br />\nnot. But a couple of months ago, to everyone's consternation,<br />\nHerkie announced that he was not going into the artificial cherry<br />\nbusiness. Nor was he going to stay in college. \"I am,\" said<br />\nHerkie,\"a member of the Beat Generation. I am going to San<br />\nFrancisco and grow a beard.\"<br />\nWell sir, you can imagine the commotion in the family when<br />\nHerkie went traipsing off to San Francisco! Uncle Walter would<br />\nhave gone after him and dragged him home, but unfortunately<br />\nhe was right in the middle of the artificial cherry season. Aunt<br />\nThelma couldn't go either because of her old leg trouble.

One still has, so to speak, a hold<br />\ncm the finer things of life\u2014like good tobacco, like easy-drawing<br />\nfiltration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoying a full-flavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basically happiness-oriented, fulfillment-directed, pleasure-prone. ,<br />\n'Herkie, what are you doing with yourself?\" I asked.<br />\n!`I am finding myself,\" he replied. !`I am writing a novel in<br />\nthe sand with a pointed stick. I am composing a fugue for<br />\nClavier and police whistle. I am sculpting in experimental materials\u2014like English muffins.\",<br />\n'And what do you do for fun?\" I asked.<br />\n\"Come,\" he said and took me to a dank little night club<br />\nWhere men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange<br />\ncrates and drank espresso.

He was less distressed than I had feared.

The upshot: Oregon State<br />\ndefeated USC (an 18-point favorite by a score of 14-0 to provide one of 1960's first major<br />\ncollege upsets.\"<br />\nThe Homewood version of<br />\nphone-to-field communications<br />\nis not as dominant as Oregon<br />\nState's. Primarily, it serves as a<br />\ncomplementary force, an extra<br />\nfactor to supply Coach Wilson<br />\nFewster with helpful suggestions.<br />\nThe word \"suggestions\" shows<br />\nwhere Hopkins' system differs<br />\nwith the \"calling all shots\"<br />\nmethod of Oregon State's Prothro.<br />\nThe variations in the two<br />\nmethods can be attributed to<br />\n<br />\nbasic differences in football philosophy. As assistant coach Ross<br />\nSachs explained it: \"we would<br />\nrather have the boys assume the<br />\ninitiative. Our tailback (either<br />\nHenry Ciccarone, Joe Cioni, or<br />\nSkip Leet) calls the majority of<br />\nthe plays. Coach Fewster will<br />\nsend in plays only in key or<br />\ncrucial situations. For instance,<br />\nin the Swarthmore game, I'd<br />\nestimate he only called five out<br />\nof seventy plays. Of course, depending on game and situation,<br />\nthis figure will vary. However,<br />\nwe do think it is a good idea for<br />\nour boys to call the plays. It<br />\nbrings out the best in them.\"<br />\nThe week before a game,<br />\nCoach Fewster will review with<br />\nhis signal callers those plays that<br />\nshould do the job against that<br />\nweek's opponent. At half-time<br />\nadjustments are made in blocking assignments to compensate<br />\nfor defensive shifts.<br />\nHopkins' telephones work like<br />\nthis: The assistant coach who<br />\nhas scouted that week's opposition will mount the steps to the<br />\npress box of Homewood Field<br />\nand assume his position there.<br />\nLast week against Dickenson,<br />\nthat man was assistant coach<br />\nSachs. His Messages are relayed<br />\nfrom booth-to-field-to Coach<br />\nFewster. The relay man is usu-<br />\n<br />\nally an injured player (in the<br />\nDickenson game it was guard<br />\nDick King) or it may even be<br />\nathletic director Mr. Marshall<br />\nTurner. In either case it is someone who is familiar with Hopkins' system. Coach Sachs explained that if he is not up in<br />\nthe booth, he will be on the<br />\nroad scouting a different club.<br />\nThis rotating system allows the<br />\ncoach who scouted the opponent<br />\nto look for flaws or patterns he<br />\nhas noted during his observation<br />\nof that team.<br />\nSuch knowledge aided Jimmy<br />\nGreenwood in his key interception in last Saturday's game, as<br />\nDickinson drove for the tying<br />\nscore. Sachs explained, \"We<br />\nknew when they lined up that<br />\nthey were in their favorite passing alignment. We hollered out<br />\nto remind Jimmy (Greenwood),<br />\nbut he had already made the<br />\nhe<br />\nproper adjustment, and<br />\n.\"<br />\nnicely<br />\nvery<br />\nit<br />\nplayed<br />\n<br />\nleft and right formations. When<br />\nthe Jays switched to a left formation the former Baltimore<br />\nPoly star failed to make the<br />\nnecessary shift. With this valuable phone information the Jays<br />\nstayed in left formation and ran<br />\nwide to Foh's opposite side for<br />\nthe touchdown and with the<br />\nsame play for the extra points.<br />\nThe variations in defense,<br />\nthen, are the most import aspect<br />\nof telephone information. Anything else of value (injtred or<br />\ntired players, new substitute entering game, etc.) is also called<br />\nto Coach Fewster's attention.<br />\n<br />\nIn tomorrow's crucial clash<br />\nagainst Western Maryland, Hopkins will probably be without the<br />\nuse of phones. Mr Sachs stated,<br />\n\"Some schools provide them for<br />\nvisitors, others don't. Phones are<br />\navailable to all visiting teams at<br />\nHopkins. I doubt if they'll be any<br />\nphone facilities at Western<br />\nMaryland. This could hurt us.<br />\nYou can't say it'll be the difference between victory and defeat, but, invariably, it might.<br />\nThey'll have a higher vantage<br />\npoint and will be able to see<br />\nthings that are impossible for us<br />\nto see at ground level.\"<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nMs_<br />\n<br />\nCoach Sachs cited this year's<br />\n8-8 tie with Washington & Lee<br />\nas .the outstanding example of<br />\nphone advantages.

Herkie's father, Walter 0. Nylet, is as everyone knows, president of the First National Artificial Cherry<br />\nCompany, world's largest maker of artificial cherries for ladies'<br />\nhats. Uncle Walter had great plans for Herkie. Last year he<br />\nsent Herkie to the Maryland College of Humanities, Sciences,<br />\nand Artificial Cherries, and he intended, upon Herkie's graduation, to find him a nice fat wife and take him into the firm as<br />\na full partner.<br />\nCould a young man have more pleasing prospects? Of course<br />\nnot. But a couple of months ago, to everyone's consternation,<br />\nHerkie announced that he was not going into the artificial cherry<br />\nbusiness. Nor was he going to stay in college. \"I am,\" said<br />\nHerkie,\"a member of the Beat Generation. I am going to San<br />\nFrancisco and grow a beard.\"<br />\nWell sir, you can imagine the commotion in the family when<br />\nHerkie went traipsing off to San Francisco! Uncle Walter would<br />\nhave gone after him and dragged him home, but unfortunately<br />\nhe was right in the middle of the artificial cherry season.

One still has, so to speak, a hold<br />\ncm the finer things of life\u2014like good tobacco, like easy-drawing<br />\nfiltration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoying a full-flavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basically happiness-oriented, fulfillment-directed, pleasure-prone. ,<br />\n'Herkie, what are you doing with yourself?\" I asked.<br />\n!`I am finding myself,\" he replied. !`I am writing a novel in<br />\nthe sand with a pointed stick. I am composing a fugue for<br />\nClavier and police whistle. I am sculpting in experimental materials\u2014like English muffins.\",<br />\n'And what do you do for fun?\" I asked.<br />\n\"Come,\" he said and took me to a dank little night club<br />\nWhere men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange<br />\ncrates and drank espresso.

The upshot: Oregon State<br />\ndefeated USC (an 18-point favorite by a score of 14-0 to provide one of 1960's first major<br />\ncollege upsets.\"<br />\nThe Homewood version of<br />\nphone-to-field communications<br />\nis not as dominant as Oregon<br />\nState's. Primarily, it serves as a<br />\ncomplementary force, an extra<br />\nfactor to supply Coach Wilson<br />\nFewster with helpful suggestions.<br />\nThe word \"suggestions\" shows<br />\nwhere Hopkins' system differs<br />\nwith the \"calling all shots\"<br />\nmethod of Oregon State's Prothro.<br />\nThe variations in the two<br />\nmethods can be attributed to<br /><br />\nbasic differences in football philosophy. As assistant coach Ross<br />\nSachs explained it: \"we would<br />\nrather have the boys assume the<br />\ninitiative. Our tailback (either<br />\nHenry Ciccarone, Joe Cioni, or<br />\nSkip Leet) calls the majority of<br />\nthe plays. Coach Fewster will<br />\nsend in plays only in key or<br />\ncrucial situations. For instance,<br />\nin the Swarthmore game, I'd<br />\nestimate he only called five out<br />\nof seventy plays. Of course, depending on game and situation,<br />\nthis figure will vary. However,<br />\nwe do think it is a good idea for<br />\nour boys to call the plays. It<br />\nbrings out the best in them.\"<br />\nThe week before a game,<br />\nCoach Fewster will review with<br />\nhis signal callers those plays that<br />\nshould do the job against that<br />\nweek's opponent. At half-time<br />\nadjustments are made in blocking assignments to compensate<br />\nfor defensive shifts.<br />\nHopkins' telephones work like<br />\nthis: The assistant coach who<br />\nhas scouted that week's opposition will mount the steps to the<br />\npress box of Homewood Field<br />\nand assume his position there.<br />\nLast week against Dickenson,<br />\nthat man was assistant coach<br />\nSachs. His Messages are relayed<br />\nfrom booth-to-field-to Coach<br />\nFewster. The relay man is usu-<br /><br />\nally an injured player (in the<br />\nDickenson game it was guard<br />\nDick King) or it may even be<br />\nathletic director Mr. Marshall<br />\nTurner. In either case it is someone who is familiar with Hopkins' system. Coach Sachs explained that if he is not up in<br />\nthe booth, he will be on the<br />\nroad scouting a different club.<br />\nThis rotating system allows the<br />\ncoach who scouted the opponent<br />\nto look for flaws or patterns he<br />\nhas noted during his observation<br />\nof that team.<br />\nSuch knowledge aided Jimmy<br />\nGreenwood in his key interception in last Saturday's game, as<br />\nDickinson drove for the tying<br />\nscore. Sachs explained, \"We<br />\nknew when they lined up that<br />\nthey were in their favorite passing alignment. We hollered out<br />\nto remind Jimmy (Greenwood),<br />\nbut he had already made the<br />\nhe<br />\nproper adjustment, and<br />\n.\"<br />\nnicely<br />\nvery<br />\nit<br />\nplayed<br /><br />\nleft and right formations. When<br />\nthe Jays switched to a left formation the former Baltimore<br />\nPoly star failed to make the<br />\nnecessary shift. With this valuable phone information the Jays<br />\nstayed in left formation and ran<br />\nwide to Foh's opposite side for<br />\nthe touchdown and with the<br />\nsame play for the extra points.<br />\nThe variations in defense,<br />\nthen, are the most import aspect<br />\nof telephone information. Anything else of value (injtred or<br />\ntired players, new substitute entering game, etc.) is also called<br />\nto Coach Fewster's attention.<br /><br />\nIn tomorrow's crucial clash<br />\nagainst Western Maryland, Hopkins will probably be without the<br />\nuse of phones. Mr Sachs stated,<br />\n\"Some schools provide them for<br />\nvisitors, others don't. Phones are<br />\navailable to all visiting teams at<br />\nHopkins. I doubt if they'll be any<br />\nphone facilities at Western<br />\nMaryland. This could hurt us.<br />\nYou can't say it'll be the difference between victory and defeat, but, invariably, it might.<br />\nThey'll have a higher vantage<br />\npoint and will be able to see<br />\nthings that are impossible for us<br />\nto see at ground level.\"<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nMs_<br /><br />\nCoach Sachs cited this year's<br />\n8-8 tie with Washington &amp; Lee<br />\nas .the outstanding example of<br />\nphone advantages.
