With<br />\nthe completion of a successful, if aesthetically unnerving,<br />\nbuilding program under Dr. Eisenhower, the argument<br />\nruns, it is now time to focus on the essential justification<br />\nfor the expanded physical plant, namely, the quality of<br />\neducation at Hopkins.<br />\nWhether or not the new president will, in fact, be<br />\noriented in this direction, the rumor is symptomatic<br />\nof a frame of mind which does presently exist among<br />\niidministration and faculty. Plans to increase faculty,<br />\noffer more courses, and broaden degree requirements<br />\n&re major innovations long needed and soon to be<br />\neffected.

Museum<br />\nCurators, art critics, and art students\u2014<br />\nthe dictators of our modern mass culture \u2014 tell us that he has received the<br />\ndeath sentence for artists; he is not<br />\nin the mainstream of the modern art<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThe hip among the art followers don't<br />\ndig him. He's old. And worst of all he<br />\nis nostalgic, almost historical.<br />\nAnd look at his pictures. He really<br />\nIs out of it. Sam Hunter, a professor<br />\nof art and spokesman for the New York<br />\nschool of art, or what is called the<br />\nAbstract Expressionist movement, tells<br />\n116 that \"in. view of the achievements<br />\nOf the Abstract Expressionists in the<br />\nfifties it is no longer possible to assume<br />\nthat the opposing currents of realism,<br />\n<br />\nularly pails, houses, shacks, fences,<br />\nweeds, grass, boats, his wife, the surrounding neighbors, dogs, and snowstorms. He attacks his limited world<br />\nwith the gusto of a Thomas Wolfe with<br />\nblinders. \"The wealth of things around<br />\nus for an artist to see is just unbelievable. To see it and clarify it in my own<br />\nmind. That is the thing,\" Wyeth comments on his choice of subjects.<br />\nAnd, indeed, this is the key to his<br />\napproach, to his philosophy, to his<br />\nart, and to his attraction of an admiring public. Wyeth simply paints and<br />\nsimply lives. His painting forces the<br />\nintensificiation of common objects to the<br />\npoint of realizing that they are a part<br />\nof him. He lives his paintings.<br />\nExistential Virtue<br />\nExistential virtue, That is what his<br />\nart is. He describes the existence of an<br />\nobject and then derives its essence.<br />\n\"All I know is that I'm not a realist<br />\nat all,\" claims Wyeth, trying to escape<br />\nthe tag placed on him by the taxonomists of art. And he isn't. If anything<br />\nhe is an abstract painter, chiefly because of the strength of his compositions. Take a look at That Gentleman,<br />\nor Racoon, or even Christina's World.<br />\nAsymetrical design and balanced focus,<br />\nspace and clutter.<br />\nColors Noted<br />\nHis paintings conjure up the ghosts<br />\nof Winslow Homer or John Singer Sergeant or Frederick Remington. But look<br />\nat his colors. For the wide range of<br />\ntone contrasted with the limited scale<br />\nof hue he can be compared with Titian<br />\nor Bellini. His use of a low key in<br />\nhis paintings can be seen in the Potato<br />\nEaters by Van Gogh or The Studio by<br />\nDaumier. Anybody can play this game.<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nIn one picture, The Children's Doctor,<br />\na portrait of a Johns Hopkins graduate,<br />\nhe is a surrealist. As a matter of fact<br />\none could compare it favorably with<br />\nDail's Gala. Her Room is another of<br />\nWyeth's creations which makes you<br />\nwonder whether he ever fooled with<br />\nLSD.<br />\n<br />\nCHRISTINA'S WORLD<br />\nings in Wyeth's reportoire also.<br />\nDistant Thunder is a good example of a daydream Tom Sawyer<br />\nexistence that prays on everybody's<br />\nmind. The Coot Hunter is another good<br />\nexample of a full, robust feeling of life.<br />\nThis picture is a good example of<br />\nWyeth's earlier period of undisciplined<br />\nwatercolor. He turned to the dry brush<br />\ntechnique and produced His Boot and<br />\nFaraway which sharpened his perspective.<br />\nAfter his father, an illustrator of<br />\nbooks, died in 1945, Wyeth turned introspective and developed his low key<br />\napproach. Many see this as sadness in<br />\nhis paintings. The mood best expressed<br />\nin this stage of his painting is Winter<br />\n1946. It also marks the maturation of<br />\nhis egg tempera technique. Egg tempera<br />\nhe picked up from his then future<br />\nbrother-in-law Peter Hurd, a noted New<br />\nMexico landscape painter. This technique, it must be explained, uses min-<br />\n<br />\ncenter around brown or black against<br />\nwhite. The Bachelor is a good example<br />\nof this. The painting is merely a white<br />\nshirt hanging on a porch, but the effect<br />\nof the white cloth coining out of the<br />\nshadow of the interior of the porch is<br />\nstunning.<br />\n<br />\nSnowstorms<br />\n<br />\nexpressionism, a traditional romanticism and abstraction are of equal<br />\nvalidity.\"<br />\nA Wet Paintbrush<br />\nApparently Wyeth can't hold a wet<br />\nsilk<br />\nRauchenbergts<br />\nto<br />\npaintbrush<br />\nMothor<br />\nsquiggles,<br />\nscreens, or Pollock's<br />\nerwell's blobs, or Indiana's stop signs,<br />\nor Warhol's soap boxes.<br />\nLook at the man and you will see<br />\nwhy. Never traveled outside of this<br />\ncountry, never went to school, and never<br />\nlived an artist's life in a garret in a<br />\nGreenwich Village atmosphere in<br />\na hostile world. No wonder he's not<br />\nin the mainstream. He lives in roughly<br />\ntwo places \u2014 Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania and Cushing, Maine. In the summer he stays in Maine, and in the<br />\nwinter he stays in Pennsylvania, where<br />\nhe was born. And worst of all, he paints<br />\ntinly what he is familiar with in these<br />\ntwo places. \"This is all I have room for<br />\nin my heart,\" states Wyeth simply<br />\nenough.<br />\nSimple Things<br />\nWyeth is a fanatic on the simple<br />\nthings he sees around him \u2014 partic-<br />\n<br />\nin<br />\nWhere Wyeth really shines<br />\nsnowstorms.

One is left with<br />\nthis impression when one looks at his<br />\npaintings. Christina's World, perhaps<br />\nthe best known of his paintings, is a<br />\nstudy in solitude. Christina's World, by<br />\nthe way, was pulled out of the current<br />\nexhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art in Philadelphia by the<br />\nMuseum of Modern Art to placate its<br />\nNew York customers.

His texture is<br />\nall a matter of perspective. When you<br />\ngo to see his exhibit at the Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art, don't stand too close<br />\nat first.

It seems more than just coincidental that the advent of snow and<br />\ncold weather accompanied the advent<br />\nof Wyeth, for Wyeth is without a doubt<br />\nthe epitome of 'cool' in art.

Dropping balloons of red<br />\npaint from a rooftop and attaching discarded urinals to wormwood boards<br />\nleaves the artist little time to play with<br />\nbrushes.<br />\n<br />\nThe catalogue notes make a big deal<br />\nabout the fact that Wyeth restricts<br />\nhis subjects to that which can be found<br />\nin close proximity to Chadds Ford, Pa.<br />\nor Cushing Maine, the artists two home<br />\ngrounds. The false simplicity that this<br />\nview of life affords leads then to<br />\nWyeth's ability to wash out all colour<br />\nfrom his work, covering all his canvas<br />\nwith a bland serum of detachment.<br />\nA great deal has been made of<br />\nWyeth's attachment for 'nostaligia' as<br />\nthe essential ingredient of his work.<br />\nThe detachment that his technique affords him serves most effectively to<br />\nbring this nostalgia to the fore.

But<br />\nWyeth will try, I suppose. He does, aftes<br />\nall, have an immense amount of artistic<br />\ntalent. But this is really quite dull,<br />\nand his work, for all its bravura effects,<br />\nIts so evident competence, is not terribly exciting.

He describes the existence of an<br />\nobject and then derives its essence.<br />\n\"All I know is that I'm not a realist<br />\nat all,\" claims Wyeth, trying to escape<br />\nthe tag placed on him by the taxonomists of art. And he isn't. If anything<br />\nhe is an abstract painter, chiefly because of the strength of his compositions.

His use of a low key in<br />\nhis paintings can be seen in the Potato<br />\nEaters by Van Gogh or The Studio by<br />\nDaumier.

He turned to the dry brush<br />\ntechnique and produced His Boot and<br />\nFaraway which sharpened his perspective.<br />\nAfter his father, an illustrator of<br />\nbooks, died in 1945, Wyeth turned introspective and developed his low key<br />\napproach. Many see this as sadness in<br />\nhis paintings. The mood best expressed<br />\nin this stage of his painting is Winter<br />\n1946. It also marks the maturation of<br />\nhis egg tempera technique. Egg tempera<br />\nhe picked up from his then future<br />\nbrother-in-law Peter Hurd, a noted New<br />\nMexico landscape painter. This technique, it must be explained, uses min-<br /><br />\ncenter around brown or black against<br />\nwhite. The Bachelor is a good example<br />\nof this. The painting is merely a white<br />\nshirt hanging on a porch, but the effect<br />\nof the white cloth coining out of the<br />\nshadow of the interior of the porch is<br />\nstunning.<br /><br />\nSnowstorms<br /><br />\nexpressionism, a traditional romanticism and abstraction are of equal<br />\nvalidity.\"<br />\nA Wet Paintbrush<br />\nApparently Wyeth can't hold a wet<br />\nsilk<br />\nRauchenbergts<br />\nto<br />\npaintbrush<br />\nMothor<br />\nsquiggles,<br />\nscreens, or Pollock's<br />\nerwell's blobs, or Indiana's stop signs,<br />\nor Warhol's soap boxes.<br />\nLook at the man and you will see<br />\nwhy.

No wonder he's not<br />\nin the mainstream. He lives in roughly<br />\ntwo places \u2014 Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania and Cushing, Maine. In the summer he stays in Maine, and in the<br />\nwinter he stays in Pennsylvania, where<br />\nhe was born. And worst of all, he paints<br />\ntinly what he is familiar with in these<br />\ntwo places. \"This is all I have room for<br />\nin my heart,\" states Wyeth simply<br />\nenough.<br />\nSimple Things<br />\nWyeth is a fanatic on the simple<br />\nthings he sees around him \u2014 partic-<br /><br />\nin<br />\nWhere Wyeth really shines<br />\nsnowstorms.

In the Mill, March Storm,<br />\nor River Valley the paint flies with the<br />\nbest of the action painters.<br />\nThey say he is sad. One is left with<br />\nthis impression when one looks at his<br />\npaintings. Christina's World, perhaps<br />\nthe best known of his paintings, is a<br />\nstudy in solitude. Christina's World, by<br />\nthe way, was pulled out of the current<br />\nexhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art in Philadelphia by the<br />\nMuseum of Modern Art to placate its<br />\nNew York customers. Her Room is sad<br />\ntoo.

And<br />\none gets the feeling that Wyeth is<br />\npainting memories. Brief flash cards in<br />\nthe cranium. \"I agree with Pollock,<br />\nand Kline, and de Kooning that there<br />\nmust be complete freedom. But they<br />\nlack the object.

His texture is<br />\nall a matter of perspective. When you<br />\ngo to see his exhibit at the Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art, don't stand too close<br />\nat first.

Dropping balloons of red<br />\npaint from a rooftop and attaching discarded urinals to wormwood boards<br />\nleaves the artist little time to play with<br />\nbrushes.<br /><br />\nThe catalogue notes make a big deal<br />\nabout the fact that Wyeth restricts<br />\nhis subjects to that which can be found<br />\nin close proximity to Chadds Ford, Pa.<br />\nor Cushing Maine, the artists two home<br />\ngrounds.

In fact, one Christmas back in my own college days, these are exactly the<br />\ngifts I gave a beauteous coed named Norma Glebe. I took<br />\na rock, a bottle of water, a bit of ribbon, and attached a<br />\ncard with this tender sentiment:<br />\nHere's some water<br />\nAnd here's a rock.<br />\nI love you,daughter,<br />\nAround the clock.<br />\nNorma was so moved, she seized the rock, smashed the<br />\nbottle, and plunged the jagged edge into my sternum.<br /><br />\nHere now is a lovely gift for an American History major<br />\n\u2014a bronze statuette of Millard Fillmore with a clock in<br />\nthe stomach.
