In fact, the University<br />\nis in a better position than many other institutions.<br />\nHazards<br />\nIn the period 1967-68 the total amount of money<br />\nreceived from the government was $35,414,549, almost<br />\nall of it going for research of one form or another. The<br />\nfigure was approximately $9 million in 1959, when the<br />\ntotal operating budget was about $21 million, an amount<br />\nthat has since risen to its present level of almost $69<br />\nrnillion. The statistics do not include the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Silver Spring, which has a<br />\nNavy contract of $52,765,000 which Hopkins just<br />\nadministrates.<br />\n<br />\nThere are two potential hazards within this large<br />\ndependence on government grants and contracts. Ross<br />\nJones, Vice-President for University Affairs, stated that<br />\n\"the ultimate danger is that government through control<br />\nof money will dictate what to do, but this has not happened in the last 20-25 years.<br />\n\"What We Want\"<br />\nThe possibility of the government telling researchers<br />\nwhat they should investigate is practically non-existent,<br />\nhe says,for,in the words of Benjamin G. Willis, Director of<br />\nthe Institute of Cooperative Research, all research done is<br />\n\"what we want to do;in fact, the University can categorically state that it doesn't take on anything that we don't<br />\nwant to do.\"<br />\nAnother danger occurring in such a large trust on<br />\ngovernment finances is that of \"a cutback of federal<br />\nfunds, which, on occassion, is somewhat material,\"<br />\naccording to Mr. Willis. Research grants lack continuity<br />\ndue to the effects of budget cuts in Washington. Most<br />\nAmerican universities are experiencing such cutbacks at<br />\n<br />\nthe present moment.<br />\n\"Large Part\"<br />\nDr. Partridge asserted that the support of the government was \"obviously a very large part of the budget and<br />\nit determines to a large extent the size of the university.\"<br />\nHe went on to say, \"if we decided to cut back federal<br />\nfunds we would have an entirely different character of<br />\ninstitution . . .

Times.<br />\n\u2022 In support of his claim, Mr.<br />\nWicker cited the strange events<br />\nof the 1968 political season, as he<br />\naddressed an audience of about<br />\n350 people at<br />\nShriver Hall this<br />\nPast Monday afternoon. He laid<br />\nParticular emphasis on the conduct of the<br />\nDemocratic Party in<br />\nChicago this past August.<br />\nAt Chicago, The Democrats<br />\nchose Humphrey because he represented all the beliefs and policies<br />\nthat have raised the party to power<br />\nand glory<br />\nduring 28 of the last 36<br />\nYears. In this way, the Democrats<br />\nshowed that they have become the<br />\nParty of the status quo with \"definite establishment features.\"<br />\n'The role of a party is to win<br />\na majority of the American voters,\" said Wicker,\"but the Democjats ignored this role at Chicago.\"<br />\nInstead they nominated a man<br />\n'ho had the support of only a decidedL<br />\nminority of the nation.'<br />\nil_ins minority was the regulars of<br />\nT<br />\nwe Democratic Party.<br />\nOther Sources<br />\nThe decision of the DemocraPic Party ignored the growth of<br />\nParticipation<br />\npolitics,\" as Wicker<br />\nalls the American political style.<br />\nTally voters no longer feel that<br />\nuteY need organization leaders to<br />\ntell them for whom they should<br />\nvote. Modern communications<br />\nhave reduced the<br />\nneed for old-time<br />\n\u00b0rganization leadership, and voters<br />\nnow use<br />\nand opinion<br />\nPolls as thetelevision<br />\nbases on which they<br />\nnlake their decisions.<br />\nWicker also pointed to earlier<br />\n,<br />\nuevelopments in this year's presidential campaign to illustrate his<br />\nPoint. He claimed that Romney<br />\nhad to drop<br />\nout of the race before<br />\nthe first<br />\ntest because he<br />\nhad such primary<br />\nlow ratings in the polls.<br />\nT. his, in<br />\ninability turn, was the result of his<br />\nto handle television in a<br />\nreliable way.<br />\n<br />\nDrawing his conclusion from<br />\nthese examples, Wicker said that<br />\n\"the nature of our politics is<br />\nchanging and 'participation politics' will be the mark of the coming political era.\"<br />\nFuture Trends<br />\nAs a footnote, he mentioned<br />\nseveral specific results of the rise<br />\nof\"participation politics.\" He said<br />\nthat there will be a greater emphasis on state primaries although<br />\nnational conventions will remain<br />\nbecause of the need to build national coalitions.

In fact, the University<br />\nis in a better position than many other institutions.<br />\nHazards<br />\nIn the period 1967-68 the total amount of money<br />\nreceived from the government was $35,414,549, almost<br />\nall of it going for research of one form or another. The<br />\nfigure was approximately $9 million in 1959, when the<br />\ntotal operating budget was about $21 million, an amount<br />\nthat has since risen to its present level of almost $69<br />\nrnillion. The statistics do not include the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Silver Spring, which has a<br />\nNavy contract of $52,765,000 which Hopkins just<br />\nadministrates.<br /><br />\nThere are two potential hazards within this large<br />\ndependence on government grants and contracts. Ross<br />\nJones, Vice-President for University Affairs, stated that<br />\n\"the ultimate danger is that government through control<br />\nof money will dictate what to do, but this has not happened in the last 20-25 years.<br />\n\"What We Want\"<br />\nThe possibility of the government telling researchers<br />\nwhat they should investigate is practically non-existent,<br />\nhe says,for,in the words of Benjamin G. Willis, Director of<br />\nthe Institute of Cooperative Research, all research done is<br />\n\"what we want to do;in fact, the University can categorically state that it doesn't take on anything that we don't<br />\nwant to do.\"<br />\nAnother danger occurring in such a large trust on<br />\ngovernment finances is that of \"a cutback of federal<br />\nfunds, which, on occassion, is somewhat material,\"<br />\naccording to Mr. Willis. Research grants lack continuity<br />\ndue to the effects of budget cuts in Washington. Most<br />\nAmerican universities are experiencing such cutbacks at<br /><br />\nthe present moment.<br />\n\"Large Part\"<br />\nDr. Partridge asserted that the support of the government was \"obviously a very large part of the budget and<br />\nit determines to a large extent the size of the university.\"<br />\nHe went on to say, \"if we decided to cut back federal<br />\nfunds we would have an entirely different character of<br />\ninstitution . . .

On the Far East,Stevenson<br />\nnever went as far away from his<br />\nPresident as Humphrey was willing<br />\nto go in Salt Lake City.
