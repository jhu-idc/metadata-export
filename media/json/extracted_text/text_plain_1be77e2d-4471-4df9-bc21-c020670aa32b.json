Holls, without whose earnest<br />\nefforts, he stated, the first conference would have been a failure,<br />\nand the Permanent Court never<br />\nestablished. Since the close of that<br />\nfirst conference in 1899, a new era,<br />\nhe said, has dawned for international arbitration.<br />\nMr. Molt's ideal seems to be a<br />\nunion of all nations, on the basis<br />\nof the union of the North American States; and in the present condition of things he professes to see<br />\nthe beginning of such a union. The<br />\nHague Conferences, which, it is<br />\nnow assured, will be held in the<br />\nfuture at regular intervals, he likens<br />\nto the old Congress of the Confederacy; in the new Court of Arbitral Justice, which, thanks to., the<br />\nzeal of Secretary Knox, is soon to<br />\nbe established, he sees an image of<br />\nour Supreme Court; and therefore<br />\nthere wants nothing save an international executive, which he thinks<br />\nwill some day surely be realized,<br />\nto the fulfillment of the splendid<br />\ndream of the last two lines of<br />\nLocksley Hall.<br />\nr. Holt, after completing his<br />\nlecture, showed some very interesting views of the Hague, and the<br />\nsurrounding country, portraits of<br />\nsome of the great peace advocates,<br />\nand several amusing cartoons from<br />\nthe press of various nations.<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting of the freshman<br />\nclass last Monday afternoon, Clifford A.

It is a thoroughly able study<br />\nof wide scope and of great theoretical and sociological as well as \u2022<br />\nhistorical value. It traces the<br />\norigin and development of Socialism through the many transient<br />\ncommunistic experiments which<br />\nhave been urged by political dreamers, with a sympathetic treatment<br />\nbrings it down to the present day,<br />\nwhen the movement is attracting<br />\nn:ore attention than it has ever before been accorded in political<br />\ncircles.<br />\nThe future, according to Mr.<br />\nHillquit, is an especially bright one.<br />\nHe believes that \"the industrial development is irresistibly preparing,<br />\nthe ground for a large and vigorous Socialistic movement,\" and<br />\nthat if the American voters could<br />\nbe persuaded that the cause is not<br />\na hopeless one, it would immediately be established as a permanent, important, and perhaps dominant factor in American politics.<br />\nBut in the concluding paragraph<br />\nof the book, there is an admission<br />\nwhich seems to destroy somewhat<br />\nthe force of the optimistic conclusions. \"Many, of the measures,\" Mr.<br />\nHillquit says, \"of industrial, social<br />\nand political reform, originally advocated exclusively by the Socialists, are gradually being forced into<br />\nthe platforms of other parties and<br />\norganizations.\" What is there to<br />\nkeep us from believing that the<br />\nend will be reached by these<br />\nmeans? The history of government<br />\nindicates that some of the desires of<br />\nthe Socialists will ultimately be attained. Soule, such as the income<br />\ntax, municipal ownership, and the<br />\ninitiative and referendum are already in existence. But is it not<br />\nmore probable that all of these reforms will be gradually brought<br />\nabout through the agency of the<br />\nregular parties than by an organization whose methods and desires are<br />\nnot at the present time in sympathy<br />\nwith the spirit of America?<br />\nL.

Questions concerning every branch of Hopkins athletics were brought up and discussed.<br />\nChief of these was the matter<br />\nof coaches for next year's football<br />\nteam. Following the expectations<br />\nof the student body, Coaches Lynn<br />\nand Sieber were re-elected to train<br />\nthe squad. This decision was received with enthusiasm by the students; Lynn and Sieber turned out<br />\na first-class team last year, and it<br />\nseemed by far the best policy to<br />\nretain them and their system of<br />\ncoaching for next year.<br />\nThe schedule for Hopkins football next year includes teams much<br />\nstronger than heretofore, and the<br />\nretention of last year's coaches assures that the greatest things possible will be done with the suad.<br />\nA problem to the football authorities next fall will be the getting<br />\ntogether of the men early in the<br />\nfall for practice. The schedule is<br />\nearly, and we want to make as good<br />\na showing as possible in our first<br />\ngame\u2014that with the Navy.

The resignation<br />\nwas accepted with reluctance. In<br />\nhis place was appointed G. Pitts<br />\nRaleigh, one of the strongest of last<br />\nyear's players. Raleigh, like Meyer, is a defense player, and thus the<br />\ngeneral composition of the coaching body will not be essentially<br />\nchanged. Raleigh is an excellent<br />\nman for coach, and he is expected<br />\nto turn out the regulation Hopkins championship lacrosse team.<br />\nOwing to press of business, two<br />\nassistants were elected to help<br />\nManager Makel.

The concert was a success<br />\nin every way and the house was<br />\npacked with a large and appreciative audience. Several encores<br />\nwere given. The solos by Mr. Conrad Ulig and Mr. Thomas De C.<br />\nRuth, Stollenwerck's piano solo,<br />\nand the trio for violin, cello, and<br />\npiano, by Messrs.

College<br />\ntraditions and local customs, it is<br />\ntrue, are sadly lacking at Hopkins,<br />\nand we should be among the last to<br />\ndecry any prank that could supply<br />\nthis want; but the class banquet<br />\nriots %aye proved too expensive,<br />\ntoo injurious to the reputation of<br />\nthe undergraduates about Baltimore, and too unpopular with the<br />\ndean and the police to be permitted<br />\nto pass down in tradition for the<br />\nemulation of future undergraduates. \\\\Then we get to Homewood, perhaps some arrangements<br />\nwill be made for an annual chinasmashing fest on our own campus<br />\nin decent privacy without any<br />\nfrantic landlords or spoil-sport<br />\npolicemen to interfere.

It is a thoroughly able study<br />\nof wide scope and of great theoretical and sociological as well as \u2022<br />\nhistorical value. It traces the<br />\norigin and development of Socialism through the many transient<br />\ncommunistic experiments which<br />\nhave been urged by political dreamers, with a sympathetic treatment<br />\nbrings it down to the present day,<br />\nwhen the movement is attracting<br />\nn:ore attention than it has ever before been accorded in political<br />\ncircles.<br />\nThe future, according to Mr.<br />\nHillquit, is an especially bright one.<br />\nHe believes that \"the industrial development is irresistibly preparing,<br />\nthe ground for a large and vigorous Socialistic movement,\" and<br />\nthat if the American voters could<br />\nbe persuaded that the cause is not<br />\na hopeless one, it would immediately be established as a permanent, important, and perhaps dominant factor in American politics.<br />\nBut in the concluding paragraph<br />\nof the book, there is an admission<br />\nwhich seems to destroy somewhat<br />\nthe force of the optimistic conclusions. \"Many, of the measures,\" Mr.<br />\nHillquit says, \"of industrial, social<br />\nand political reform, originally advocated exclusively by the Socialists, are gradually being forced into<br />\nthe platforms of other parties and<br />\norganizations.\" What is there to<br />\nkeep us from believing that the<br />\nend will be reached by these<br />\nmeans? The history of government<br />\nindicates that some of the desires of<br />\nthe Socialists will ultimately be attained. Soule, such as the income<br />\ntax, municipal ownership, and the<br />\ninitiative and referendum are already in existence. But is it not<br />\nmore probable that all of these reforms will be gradually brought<br />\nabout through the agency of the<br />\nregular parties than by an organization whose methods and desires are<br />\nnot at the present time in sympathy<br />\nwith the spirit of America?<br />\nL.
