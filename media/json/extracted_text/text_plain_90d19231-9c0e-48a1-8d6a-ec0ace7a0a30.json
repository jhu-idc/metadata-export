Composed of four at-large members, the<br />\nStudent Council treasurer, and<br />\nthe Student Council president, the<br />\nSAC Executive Board \"spent all<br />\nof last week skipping classes,\" as<br />\nmember Meidee Goh put it, to<br />\ndecide next year's budget.<br />\n\"We ask ourselves what will<br />\nhave the greatest impact on the<br />\ngreatest number of students,\"<br />\nsaid Howell Sasser, another<br />\nBoard member. \"Groups that<br />\nhave limited appeal will receive<br />\nlimited funding.\"<br />\nThe number of members in a<br />\ngroup, though, is not a deciding<br />\nfactor for Klupt, who remarked<br />\nthat a very active group with only a few members will receive<br />\nmore funding than a group with<br />\nmany members that is not involved in many activities.<br />\n\"If we're on the SAC, we<br />\nknow what's going on in the student groups,\" said Klupt. The<br />\nother members of the SAC Board<br />\nconcurred, saying that groups<br />\nwould have difficulty in deceiving the SAC in order to receive<br />\nmore funding by pretending to<br />\nhave been more active or by padding the membership list with fictitious members. \"No one has<br />\ntried or succeeded in doing that<br />\nat Hopkins,\" said Sasser.<br />\nTo say that last year's<br />\nbreakdown of the SAC budget<br />\nserves as a blueprint for this<br />\nyear's allocations is \"not exact by<br />\nfar,\" according to Klupt. The<br />\namount of money a particular<br />\ngroup receives, however, does<br />\nrepresent a trend from past years.<br />\n\"Some groups get money<br />\nbecause they always got money in<br />\nthe past,\" criticized Klupt. \"The<br />\nSAC has to learn to spend its<br />\nmoney more wisely, not<br />\nfrivolously.\"<br />\nArguing that some groups are<br />\nnot active enough to deserve the<br />\nsubsidies currently allotted to<br />\nthem, Klupt said that the SAC<br />\n<br />\nbudget of $160,000 \"meets the<br />\nneeds of active student groups.\"<br />\nGoh agreed but added that the<br />\nbudget may have to be increased<br />\nin the near future to accomodate<br />\nnew interest groups. \"As the<br />\nnumber of student groups added<br />\neach year increases, we're going<br />\nto come to a crunch,\" she said.<br />\nThree new student groups<br />\nformed this year: the Caribbean<br />\nInterest Group, the Irish Students<br />\nAssociation, and the Nipponese<br />\nStudents Association. Also this<br />\nyear, the SAC began supporting<br />\nsports groups that do not have but<br />\nseek varsity status. Klupt said that<br />\nsuch support does not add much<br />\nto the financial burden on the<br />\nSAC, but it gives legitimacy to nonvarsity sports such as women's<br />\nsoccer.<br />\nAbout one-half of the SAC<br />\nbudget is allocated to the Student<br />\nCouncil. Funds go to the Milton<br />\nS. Eisenhower Symposium; student services; the freshmen,<br />\nsophomore, junior, and senior<br />\nclasses; and the standing committees of the Student Council. The<br />\nfour at-large members of the<br />\nBoard do not vote on these funds.<br />\nAccording to Sasser, the Board<br />\nspends most of its time deciding<br />\nhow to distribute this year's eight<br />\npercent increase in the budget<br />\nfairly to the student groups. The<br />\nlargest subsidies are usually<br />\nawarded each year to the Course<br />\nGuide, Hullabaloo, and the JHU<br />\nBand.<br />\nNew expenses arose this year<br />\nfrom subsidies for the publication<br />\nof political newsletters by the<br />\nYoung Democrats and College<br />\nRepublicans, titled The First<br />\nAmendment and HOPGOP,<br />\nrespectively. Klupt said that the<br />\nSAC plans to cap the funding for<br />\nsuch projects next year by forc- ,<br />\ning non-publication groups such<br />\nas the Young Democrats to find<br />\nalternative methods of financing<br />\npublications, in addition to getting<br />\nsubsidies from the SAC.<br />\n\"We take a lot of fat off the<br />\ntop,\" said Goh about the evaluation of student budget requests.<br />\nMost groups do not receive all the<br />\n<br />\nmoney they request.<br />\n\"We cut them back to what<br />\nthey really need,\" said Sasser.<br />\nSasser noted that student groups<br />\nmay protest before the full<br />\nmembership of the SAC if they<br />\nbelieve that necessary funds have<br />\nbeen denied. \"They have to<br />\nremember that what they get in<br

If speed<br />\nis what you need, try the Yellow<br />\nPages, but call before you send<br />\nyour resume.

Do not forget to call.<br />\nIf they say that they don't know<br />\nif they're hiring yet, ask them<br />\nwhen to call again, and do it. Persistence pays off.<br />\nConsider volume mailings.

Up<br />\nto this time, the only alternative<br />\nhad been contact lenses.<br />\nNow, a new surgical technique<br />\nis freeing thousands from the<br />\nphysical and psychological<br />\nburdens traditionally associated<br />\nwith eyeglasses. This procedure,<br />\noriginally developed by a Soviet<br />\nsurgeoa named Svyatoslav<br />\nFyodorov, is called radial<br />\nkeratotomy. As its name implies,<br />\nthe surgery involves incisions in<br />\nthe cornea, oriented outward<br />\nfrom its center like the spokes of<br />\na wheel.<br />\nThe majority of eyeglass<br />\nwearers are myopic, or nearsighted. They can see objects<br />\nclose to them clearly but have<br />\ntrouble discerning things some<br />\ndistance away. Myopia is<br />\nmeasured on a proportional scale.<br />\nFor instance, M, who has 20/40<br />\nvision, can read a poster from 20<br />\nfeet which P, who has 20/20 vision, can discern at 40.<br />\nThe process of seeing is simple. Light passes through the cornea and lens and is reflected back<br />\nto the retinal wall. The spot<br />\n<br />\nwhere the image is projected on<br />\nthe retina is called the focal point<br />\nThe position of the point depends<br />\nupon the distance between the<br />\nlens and the retina, the curvature<br />\nof the lens, and the angle at which<br />\nlight rays enter the eye.<br />\nIn nearsighted eyes, the focal<br />\npoint ends up forward of the<br />\nretina. As a result, a blurry image is sent via the optic nerve to<br />\nthe brain. Those with 20/20 vision have a focal point directly on<br />\nthe retina and are termed emmetropic. Corrective lenses,<br />\nwhether they be glasses or contact lenses, change the angle at<br />\nwhich light rays enter the eye and<br />\nbring the focal point closer to the<br />\nretinal wall.<br />\nRadial keratotomy acts on the<br />\nsame principle: the surgeon alters<br />\nthe eye's configuration, changing<br />\nthe angle at which light rays enter<br />\nthe eye. In a 30 minute outpatient<br />\nvisit, the surgeon makes from 4<br />\nto 16 cuts in the subject's cornea.<br />\nAs these incisions heal, the cornea flattens. The angle incidence<br />\nis changed, and vision approximates emmetropia. The surgery<br />\ncosts about $1500 per eye.<br />\nIn the most detailed study of<br />\nradial keratotomy to date, a National Eye Institute-funded team<br />\nfollowed the surgery and<br />\n<br />\nrecovery of 435 patients. The<br />\nNEI study proved one point:<br />\nradial keratotomy works, and<br />\nworks well, for many of those<br />\nwho elect for the surgery. After<br />\nthree years, 51 percent of the test<br />\ngroup subjects had 20/20<br />\nvision\u2014quite a success story for<br />\nradial keratotomy, given that 99<br />\npercent of the subjects began with<br />\nvision 20/50 or worse, and almost<br />\nhalf originally had vision worse<br />\nthan 20/200. Those who experienced the greatest improvement were moderately nearsighted to begin with.<br />\nThe biggest drawback to the<br />\nsurgery has been it's unpredictability. Each eye is unique, and<br />\nsurgeons have difficulty foreseeing how a given eye will respond<br />\nto radial keratotomy. As the<br />\nnumbers show, not everyone's<br />\nmyopia is alleviated. Approximately 16 percent of the test subjects in the NEI study actually<br />\nended up over-corrected, or farsighted. Repeat surgery on the<br />\nsame eye was even less predictable. Says the NE! report: \"We<br />\ndo not know which individuals<br />\nwill require modification of the<br />\nsurgical technique.\"<br />\n. There have been other detrimental effects linked to the<br />\nsurgery. Sporadic cases of dou-<br />\n<br />\nble vision (caused by one nearsighted eye and one farsighted<br />\neye) have been reported. A small<br />\npercentage of subjects have found<br />\nthat their vision deteriorates from<br />\n20/20 to 20/30 or worse by nighttime: Subjects whose vision was<br />\nnot sufficiently improved to allow<br />\nthem to discard their glasses<br />\nfound that the cornea's new shape<br />\nprevented them from wearing<br />\ntheir contact lenses, meaning they<br />\nwere forced to put on the frames<br />\nthey had hoped to escape.<br />\nWhen their pupils dilated in<br />\ndarkness, some subjects saw the<br />\ncorneal scars as a starburst, for<br />\nexample, in the headlights of the<br />\napproaching car. It was concern<br />\nover this glare and oscillation of<br />\nvisual lucidity which prompted a<br />\nSeptember 1985 Air Force decree<br />\nprohibiting those who had<br />\nundergone radial keratotomy<br />\nfrom enlisting.<br />\nThe most serious potential problem, according to optholmologists, is delayed bacterial<br />\nkeratitis, a violent infection at the<br />\noperation site. In spite of these<br />\npotential effects, none of the subjects in the National Eye Institute<br />\nstudy suffered a major vision<br />\nimpairment.<br />\nWithin the professional realm,<br />\nthe surgery is still looked upon as<br />\n<br />\nrisky. In August of 1985, the<br />\nAmerican Academy of Opthalmology (AAO) said the procedure had \"uncertain consequences.\" While the NEI's report<br />\nis generally favorable, some opthalmologists say the study can<br />\nonly be considered incomplete.<br />\nAlthough it analyzed the patient's<br />\nprogress after three years, detractors say that the cornea can take<br />\nup to five years to heal. Some opthalmologists suggest the latent<br />\nside effects of radial keratotomy<br />\nmay not appear until many years<br />\nafter the surgery. At present,<br />\nmany opthalmologists are loathe<br />\nto operate on a structurally sound<br />\neye. Only ten percent of U.S. opthalmologists will even perform<br />\nthe simple procedure.<br />\nIn any case, those hoping to<br />\nescape the tyranny of glasses by<br />\ntaking their chances with the<br />\nsurgery still face Nature's last<br />\nlaugh: near vision wanes in all of<br />\nus during middle age, but those<br />\nwith normal vision experience<br />\nthis decline about ten years<br />\nsooner than their nearsighted<br />\ncounterparts. So, while a successful radial keratotomy may<br />\nspeed your glasses' departure<br />\nnow, it may also, in the long run,<br />\nhasten their return.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/23<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\n<br />\nJays gun down Army, 9-5<br />\nMorrill and Crawford supply ammunition for sixth straight<br />\nby Steven Silber<br />\nJohns Hopkins lacrosse<br />\ndefeated Army 9-5 last Saturday<br />\nat Michie Stadium in West Point,<br />\nN.Y.

Another key to<br />\nthe team's success is good alumni relations.\"<br />\nWorking hard seems inherent<br />\nin Jack. \"When I go out, whether<br />\nin practice or a game, I go out,<br />\nexcuse the cliche, to do my best<br />\nand I hope that it rubs off on my<br />\nteammates. Having been cocaptain for soccer and now<br />\nlacrosse, I feel I have a respon-<br />\n<br />\nsibility to set a good example<br />\nwhen I'm out there. As a result,<br />\nI feel more pressure to work very<br />\nhard.\"<br />\nHowever, he is human; he has<br />\nhad to work hard for the respect<br />\nof other players: \"I was recruited<br />\nas a soccer player, not as a<br />\nlacrosse player. When I first got<br />\nhere, I felt it was one of the low<br />\npoints of my career. I hadn't yet<br />\nproven myself. I was playing soccer and at the same time was worried about trying out for lacrosse.<br />\nI've gotten a great deal from<br />\nlacrosse. I wasn't recruited and<br />\nCoach Zimmerman had the option of giving me a tryout. That<br />\nwas great, but I still went through<br />\na lot of pressure. Quitting to<br />\nrelease the pressure held some<br />\nappeal. However, once I did prove myself, there was a great deal<br />\nof satisfaction.<br />\n\"Injuring my knee was the<br />\nother low point. It was very<br />\nfrustrating, whereas the pressure<br />\nwhen I first got here was frightening. However, I knew that all I<br />\nhad to do was maintain a positive<br />\nattitude and work hard at<br />\nrehabilitation in order to recover.<br />\n\"I think that epitomizes teams<br />\nhere. For example, last year in<br />\nlacrosse and two years ago in soccer both teams lost games they<br />\nknow they shouldn't have, but<br />\nnever gave up. They maintained<br />\na positive attitude.\" To readers<br />\non D-level at MSE library, the<br />\nlacrosse team finished the year as<br />\nnational champions.<br />\n\"Lacrosse is always exciting.<br />\nAnytime you're on a national<br />\nchampionship team, it's a great<br />\nfeeling. Last year especially. And<br />\nin soccer, being a part of a<br />\nrebuilding program that got to<br />\nplay the number one team is also<br />\na great feeling.\" Jack is especially lucky because he has this<br />\nseason for a fourth national<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nLacrosse has changed, though, to<br />\nJack. \"Over the past few years,<br />\nthe team has gotten closer, both<br />\nto the school and within itself.<br />\nThere are more lacrosse players<br />\nthat compete in other sports for<br />\nHopkins and this brings the teams<br />\ncloser to the school. The team<br />\nitself has always been close. They<br />\nhave to be close because of the<br />\nhigh pressure situation they're<br />\nin.<br />\nJack without sports . . .\"I'm<br />\nalways playing something. As a<br />\nresult, I've never gotten to play<br />\nAn BIA sports. .With varsity<br />\nsports, I would play BIA. I tend<br />\nto get very frustrated when I'm<br />\nnot playing sports.<br />\n\"Sports have done a great deal<br />\nfor me both on and off the field.<br />\nI'm grateful for the opportunity<br />\nto have made some very good<br />\nfriends on all teams.<br />\n\"It would be enough for me if<br />\npeople remembered me as an<br />\nathlete, as a player and as a person who simply always gave his<br />\nbest shot, on and off the field, and<br />\nhad a positive influence to them<br />\nin sports and in life in general<br />\nhere at Hopkins.<br />\n\"Keep in sight that you're here<br />\nfor an education and to enjoy<br />\nyourself. Work and have fun. I<br />\n<br />\nknow I've had fun. It is tiring.<br />\nThere will be times when you<br />\nwonder if the effort you give is<br />\nworth it, and it is because you<br />\nnever miss it until it's gone. Simple things like talking with people. I appreciate being able to talk<br />\nhockey with Rich Moscarello and<br />\nI'd like to thank him. He's a great<br />\nguy.<br />\n\"I will definitely continue to<br />\nplay, but now I'll also be<br />\ncoaching, trying to convey a<br />\nsense of enjoyment of sports to<br />\nothers.\"<br />\n<br />\nCindy Harper will graduate<br />\nwith a degree in psychology after<br />\nfour years of varsity basketball<br />\nand two years of varsity track.<br />\nShe notes the changes in<br />\nbasketball. \"The team's practices<br />\nhave become harder. My first two<br />\nyears, there were people who<br />\nwere interested in basketball and<br />\nplayed for the fun of it on the<br />\nteam. Now,there are recruits and<br />\nyou can see that the level of skill<br />\nis higher with players who concentrated on basketball for four<br />\nyears in high school. Now with<br />\nseven freshmen, it is just a matter of developing the team.<br />\n\"Coach Blank is very<br />\ndedicated, giving basketball a lot<br />\nof attention. Now, a wave has to<br />\nhappen. We have the first wave<br />\nof a coach being interested. Next,<br />\nwe have to convince the school<br />\nthat we are viable contenders in<br />\nthe MAC and UAA.<br />\n\"There was a lot more support<br />\nthis past year than I've ever seen<br />\nat Hopkins women's basketball<br />\ngames. We had a lot of followers<br />\nwho came out to every game and<br />\nthat was good.<br />\n\"There's always room for improvement. We probably need<br />\nmore money for basketball. We<br />\nmay need a whole new athletic<br />\ncomplex as the gym isn't really<br />\nmodern at all.<br />\n\"I did a lot of stuff for track.<br />\nI never went to the MAC's even<br />\nthough I qualified for them. Each<br />\ntime something came up and I<br />\ncouldn't go. I didn't have time in<br />\nthe spring to run track. They<br />\ncould use some coaches.\"<br />\nOf all the athletes interviewed,<br />\nCindy said the least and did the<br />\nmost. She does so well at sports<br />\nthat one might overlook her nonsport activities. \"I want people to<br />\nremember me as someone who<br />\nwasn't just a scholar.

It was all mental. The<br />\ntalent was there but we couldn't<br />\nput it together all the time. The<br />\ncoaches claim it was due to having only four seniors but I don't<br />\nthink that's true. We have such a<br />\nstrong core of juniors and<br />\nsophomores. Next year they will<br />\nbe a really solid team. The team<br />\nhas the potential to seriously contend in the Centennial<br />\nconference.<br />\n\"It comes down to mental<br />\ntoughness. I hate to say it but in<br />\npressure situations, coach gets<br />\ntense and scared. The players see<br />\nthis and do the same. I think<br />\nCoach Pieffer is a great offensive<br />\ncoordinator. We do so many<br />\nthings on offense that opposing<br />\ndefenses hope for us to have a<br />\nmental breakdown in execution.<br />\nI think Coach Babb should be<br />\nhead coach.

I didn't participate in any varsity sports in<br />\nhigh school. Hopkins was my<br />\nfirst experience. It's an opportunity I appreciate. One of the<br />\nreasons I chose Hopkins is<br />\nbecause I knew I'd play football.<br />\nMost of my experience came<br />\nfrom street football and there's a<br />\ntoughness to it which a lot of guys<br />\ndon't have and that gives me an<br />\nedge. Football has helped me,<br />\nespecially in academics. This<br />\ncomes from knowing I had to<br />\ndedicate myself to my studies due<br />\nto the time commitment. It gave<br />\nme discipline.<br />\n\"I got to start my first game<br />\nbecause of an injury to one of the<br />\nstarters in preseason. My first<br />\nreception was a 64 yard<br />\ntouchdown. I was psyched. Then<br />\nlater in the game I had another<br />\n,touchdown called back. I was a<br />\nlittle upset when I got benched as<br />\nsoon as the starter recovered. I've<br />\nnever really had the chance to<br />\nplay a really great game. I've had<br />\nsome good ones, but not a great<br />\none.

The Hopkins Men's Track<br />\nTeam silenced its critics by<br />\ndefeating 3 of4 opponents in two<br />\ntri-meets on Saturday and<br />\nWednesday at Hopkins to raise its<br />\nseason record to a surprising 4-3<br />\nmark. The only loss suffered by<br />\nthe team was on Saturday when<br />\nthe defending MAC Track Champion Ursinus Bears defeated the<br />\nJays. However, the Jays did not<br />\nlose without presenting a<br />\nlegitimate challenge to the Bears,<br />\nwho have not lost a dual or trimeet in the last two years. On the<br />\nstrength of five first place and<br />\nfour second place finishes in the<br />\nrunning events, the Jays were only six points behind the Bears<br />\nupon entering the field event<br />\ncompetition and the Jays seemed<br />\nto be in an ideal position to pull<br />\na major upset. Unfortunately, the<br />\nBears, led by 15 points from their<br />\nthree time All American in the<br />\nJavelin, Discus and Shot Put,<br />\npulled away and handily defeated<br />\nthe Jays 104.5 to 68.5. Loyola<br />\nCollege also competed in the trimeet but could only manage to<br />\nscore 8 points as their men's track<br />\nprogram is in its first year and is<br />\nstill developing.<br />\nThe Jays were led in point scoring by freshman Matt Hannon,<br />\nwho scored 10 points with two<br />\nfirst place finishes in the 110<br />\nHigh Hurdles and the 400 Intermediate Hurdles. Other first<br />\nplace finishers included senior<br />\nand Co-Captain Paul Park, who<br />\nwon the 400 meter run with a<br />\n<br />\ntime of 53.46, Co-Captain Scott<br />\nBaker, who won the 800 in<br />\n2:01.5 and senior Tim Marean,<br />\nwho won the 5000 with a time of<br />\n15 minutes and 37 seconds.<br />\nfreshman Mark Melia ran a personal best time by taking second<br />\nin the 1500 with a time of 4:17.5.<br />\nfreshman hurdler Tom Chiari<br />\nalso contributed 3 points to the<br />\nteam effort with second place<br />\nfinish in the 110 High Hurdles.<br />\nDespite tough competition from<br />\na talented Ursinus field team, the<br />\nJays field squad managed to score<br />\n22.5 points led by a first place<br />\nfinish by Max Polska in the Triple Jump. Glenn Sabin added two<br />\nsecond place finishes in the Shot<br />\nPut and Discus and the multitalented Eric Hastings furthered<br />\nthe teams effort by scoring the<br />\nJavelin (2nd), Discus (3rd), and<br />\nShot Put and Triple Jump (4th).<br />\nOn Wednesday, the Jays expanded upon their newly-found<br />\nsuccess by defeating both<br />\nWestern Maryland and York College. The team was led by an impressive showing by its distant<br />\nteam, which scored 26 of a possible 33 points. Although the<br />\ndistance men did not sweep any<br />\none event totally, it took first, second, and third place in the 1500<br />\nand 800 meter runs. This same<br />\nfeat was accomplished by the Jays<br />\nin the Javelin and Triple Jump<br />\nevents. However, the most<br />\nsignificant accomplishment of the<br />\nday might have been the depth<br />\nand team effort exhibited by the<br />\nJays on the whole. The tracksters<br />\nwon 6 of 17 first places, 9 of 17<br />\nsecond places and an amazing 13.<br />\n<br />\nof 17 third places. All of these,<br />\nplus five fourth place finishes,<br />\ncombined to give the Jays a team<br />\nscore 85, which was comfortably<br />\nahead of both Western Maryland<br />\n(52 points) and York (46 points).<br />\nLeading the way for Hopkins in<br />\nscoring was freshman Eric<br />\nHastings, who scored a first in the<br />\nJavelin, a second in the Triple<br />\nJump and two thirds in the Shot<br />\nPut and Discus for a total of 12<br />\npoints for the day. Weightman<br />\nGlenn Sabin added 9 points with<br />\nthree second place finished in the<br />\n<br />\nShot Put. Discus, and Javelin.<br />\nBoth Mark Melia and Scott Baker<br />\nran well, scoring 8 points each<br />\nwith first and second place<br />\nfinishes. Mark ran a 4:17.3 to<br />\nwin the 1500 and later returned<br />\nto take second in the 5000, while<br />\nScott took second in the 1500 and<br />\nwon the 800. He also contributed<br />\na 53 second quarter to the winning 1600 relay team of Sullivan,<br />\nBaker, Hannon, and Park, which<br />\nlowered its season best to 3:31.1.<br />\nSenior Paul Park continued his<br />\nwinning ways with a 51.6 in the<br />\n<br />\nquarter as did Max Polska by<br />\nwinning the Triple Jump once<br />\nagain.<br />\nThe mens track team will next<br />\nface a tough Messiah squad at<br />\nSwarthmore, which is not a bad<br />\nteam itself, on Saturday.

I<br />\nmean, here is a team that, in any<br />\nother year but 1987, would probably have finished third in their<br />\ndivision. Yet, because they<br />\nplayed excellent baseball in last<br />\nyear's postseason, the Twins' upper management has deluded<br />\nitself into thinking that it has all<br />\nthe necessary pieces to win the<br />\nWorld Series again in 1988. Someone should tell Andy MacPhail<br />\nand Tom Kelly that Steve<br />\nCarlton, Tippy Martinez, and Joe<br />\nNiekro aren't going to lead the<br />\nteam to the top of the mountain<br />\nthis year.<br />\n\u2014What I want to know is,<br />\nwhen will people stop belittling<br />\nthe efforts of Darryl Strawberry?<br />\nSure, he's a head case, but as a<br />\nbaseball player he's phenomenal.<br />\nIn fact, I think he's a better offensive force than Don Mattingly. Darryl has more power, is a<br />\nbetter judge of the strike zone,<br />\nand steals more bases in a season<br />\nthan Mattingly will in his career.<br />\nComparing their best seasons<br />\n(Mattingly's 1985 vs. Straw's<br />\n1987), the only significant advantage Mattingly has over<br />\nStrawberry is in RBI (145 vs.<br />\n<br />\n104). There are two obvious<br />\nreasons for this: 1) Rickey<br />\nHenderson and 2) Opportunities.<br />\nIn 1987, Strawberry had 236 atbats with men on base. In 1985,<br />\nMattingly had 315 at-bats with<br />\nmen on base, nearly 80 more than<br />\nStrawberry. How the hell is<br />\nStrawberry going to drive in men<br />\nthat aren't there?<br />\n\u2014What I want to know is, what<br />\nare Rick Cerone, Bill Buckner,<br />\nand Steve Kemp still doing in the<br />\nmajors?<br />\n\u2014 What I want to know is,<br />\nwhen will Jim Rice rein in his ego<br />\nfor the good of the team? If the<br />\nfuture of the Red Sox lies with<br />\noutfielders Greenwell and Burks,<br />\nand if Evans at this point is a better fielder than Rice (both points<br />\nare very true), then it behooves<br />\nRice to volunteer for DH duty.<br />\nBut Rice, following in the<br />\nfootsteps of Dave Parker, sullenly<br />\nrefuses to accomodate the team,<br />\nwhile John McNamara, following<br />\nin the tradition of George Bush,<br />\nis much too much of a wimp to<br />\nchange Rice's mind.<br />\n\u2014What I want to know is,<br />\nwould Sandy Koufax be able to<br />\nshut out this year's Yankees?<br />\n\u2014What I want to know is, how<br />\nmany Hall of Famers have I had<br />\nthe privilege of watching? I have<br />\nbeen a fan of baseball for only<br />\nseven years, yet I can tick off the<br />\nnames of at least 40 players I have<br />\npersonally watched who have a<br />\ngood shot at the Hall.

Composed of four at-large members, the<br />\nStudent Council treasurer, and<br />\nthe Student Council president, the<br />\nSAC Executive Board \"spent all<br />\nof last week skipping classes,\" as<br />\nmember Meidee Goh put it, to<br />\ndecide next year's budget.<br />\n\"We ask ourselves what will<br />\nhave the greatest impact on the<br />\ngreatest number of students,\"<br />\nsaid Howell Sasser, another<br />\nBoard member. \"Groups that<br />\nhave limited appeal will receive<br />\nlimited funding.\"<br />\nThe number of members in a<br />\ngroup, though, is not a deciding<br />\nfactor for Klupt, who remarked<br />\nthat a very active group with only a few members will receive<br />\nmore funding than a group with<br />\nmany members that is not involved in many activities.<br />\n\"If we're on the SAC, we<br />\nknow what's going on in the student groups,\" said Klupt. The<br />\nother members of the SAC Board<br />\nconcurred, saying that groups<br />\nwould have difficulty in deceiving the SAC in order to receive<br />\nmore funding by pretending to<br />\nhave been more active or by padding the membership list with fictitious members. \"No one has<br />\ntried or succeeded in doing that<br />\nat Hopkins,\" said Sasser.<br />\nTo say that last year's<br />\nbreakdown of the SAC budget<br />\nserves as a blueprint for this<br />\nyear's allocations is \"not exact by<br />\nfar,\" according to Klupt. The<br />\namount of money a particular<br />\ngroup receives, however, does<br />\nrepresent a trend from past years.<br />\n\"Some groups get money<br />\nbecause they always got money in<br />\nthe past,\" criticized Klupt. \"The<br />\nSAC has to learn to spend its<br />\nmoney more wisely, not<br />\nfrivolously.\"<br />\nArguing that some groups are<br />\nnot active enough to deserve the<br />\nsubsidies currently allotted to<br />\nthem, Klupt said that the SAC<br /><br />\nbudget of $160,000 \"meets the<br />\nneeds of active student groups.\"<br />\nGoh agreed but added that the<br />\nbudget may have to be increased<br />\nin the near future to accomodate<br />\nnew interest groups. \"As the<br />\nnumber of student groups added<br />\neach year increases, we're going<br />\nto come to a crunch,\" she said.<br />\nThree new student groups<br />\nformed this year: the Caribbean<br />\nInterest Group, the Irish Students<br />\nAssociation, and the Nipponese<br />\nStudents Association. Also this<br />\nyear, the SAC began supporting<br />\nsports groups that do not have but<br />\nseek varsity status. Klupt said that<br />\nsuch support does not add much<br />\nto the financial burden on the<br />\nSAC, but it gives legitimacy to nonvarsity sports such as women's<br />\nsoccer.<br />\nAbout one-half of the SAC<br />\nbudget is allocated to the Student<br />\nCouncil. Funds go to the Milton<br />\nS. Eisenhower Symposium; student services; the freshmen,<br />\nsophomore, junior, and senior<br />\nclasses; and the standing committees of the Student Council.

The majority of these books are interesting at best(The Gentlemanly<br />\nSerpent) to downright weird<br />\n(Hydroponic Gardening) at<br />\nworst. Last night I was finishing<br />\nThe Seven Mysteries of Life by<br />\nnoted scientist/philosopher Guy<br />\nMurchie. According to Murchie,<br />\nthe seven mysteries are: The<br />\nAbstract Nature of the Universe,<br />\nThe Interrelatedness of All<br />\nCreatures, The Omnipresence of<br />\nLife, The Polarity Principle,<br />\nTranscendence, The Germination<br />\nof Worlds, and \"The Seventh and<br />\nUltimate Mystery,\" Divinity.<br />\nNow I wouldn't argue with<br />\nMurchie about his categories, but<br />\nI hardly think the metaphysical<br />\nstanding of a screwworm is of<br />\ngreat importance to the layman.<br />\nTo find out just what my peers<br />\nconsider to be the great mysteries<br />\nof life, I took up an informal poll.<br />\nHere are the results, unranked.<br />\nWill the Orioles Ever Win a<br />\nGame? Although not one of the<br />\nmore profound queries inhabiting<br />\nthe minds of my fellows, it is<br />\nnevertheless one of the more<br />\nuniversal. Of course, this question itself can be broken into<br />\nmany sub-questions, including:<br />\nDo the Oriole's brass think wearing orange uniforms makes the<br />\nteam look any less pathetic? Will<br />\nthe Orioles be mathematically<br />\neliminated from the pennant race<br />\nbefore the All-Star Break? When<br />\nwill the Orioles stop embarassing<br /><br />\nthemselves by advertising on TV<br />\nfor season tickets? Will all sports<br />\ncasters be wearing black armbands in honor of the moribund<br />\nBirds? I write this on Monday.<br />\nYou read it on Friday. In the interim, it's possible that the Birds<br />\ncould pull one out and answer the<br />\nabove, but then again, it's also<br />\npossible that Arafat will become<br />\nPope, that intelligent life will be<br />\ndiscovered on television, and that<br />\nthe sky will fall.<br />\nIf 7-11 is open 24 hours,<br />\nseven days a week, why are<br />\nthere locks on the doors? This<br />\ntruly provocative question comes<br />\nfrom a certain Constance, who<br />\naccosted me on Charles Street<br />\ncrying, \"Oomp-Pah, Oomp-Pah,<br />\nOomp-Paddy-Do, I've got<br />\nanother riddle for you.\" I can<br />\nremember my days as a mere<br />\nbabe, stubbing my toes on the hot<br />\nFloridian sidewalks in search of<br />\na Slurpee. Back then, before the<br />\nmoral pantyhose of our society<br />\ngot that dreadful run in them,<br />\n7-11's opened at seven a.m. and<br />\nclosed at 11 p.m. Now they're<br />\nopen twenty-fours.

Also, for those who have cars and would<br />\nike to get away from the traditional Inner Harbor hangout,<br />\naussner's would be a good choice.<br />\nThe restaurant is invariably crowded on Friday and Saturay evenings, so we suggest coming early during those<br />\nays since Haussner's does not take reservations.<br />\n\u2014AP<br />\nSUNDAY BRUNCH AT<br />\nHYATT HOTEL. 300 Light<br />\nStreet. Major credit cards.<br />\n528-1234. ***$$$<br />\nSunday morning brunch<br />\nat the Inner Harbor Hyatt<br />\nHotel is the perfect way to<br />\nbegin a day. Located at 300<br />\nLight Street, directly across<br />\nfrom the Inner Harbor, the<br />\nHyatt brunch offers much<br />\nmore than a traditional<br />\nbreakfast. The tantalizing<br />\nselections include champagne, seafood, imported<br />\ncheeses, many varieties of<br />\nsalads, breads still hot from<br />\nthe oven and the freshest of<br />\nfruit. Relaxing live music,<br />\nusually by a violinist, pianist<br />\nor harpist, provides a<br />\ndelightful accompaniment to<br />\nthe meal. With their dedication to detail always apparent, the courteous waiters<br />\npresent a red rose to each<br />\nwoman at the end of the<br /><br />\nmeal. Reservations are<br />\nhighly suggested. Brunch is<br />\nserved from ten to two<br />\no'clock. Dress is casual.<br />\nCost is $18.50 per adult.<br />\n\u2014SH<br />\nLOUIE'S BOOKSTORECAFE. 518 N. Charles St.<br />\n962-1224. Accepts only MC,<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\nV. ***$$/<br />\nLouie's Bookstore-Cafe is a<br />\nsmall, cozy place one block<br />\nbeyond the Monument on<br />\nCharles Street as you are<br />\ncoming from Hopkins. People usually don't frequent<br />\nLouie's just for the food. It's<br />\nalso the magazine rack,<br />\ngreeting card selection,<br />\npoetry books, live baroque<br />\nmusic, and friendly staff<br />\nwhich<br />\nattract<br />\nmany<br />\ncustomers and regulars. The<br />\nwalls there change continually with the selling and<br />\ndisplaying of local' original<br />\nartwork. Louie's atmosphere<br /><br />\nis one of an earthy French<br />\ncafe where friends gather<br />\nevery weekend.<br />\nThe food is more than<br />\npalatable and is usually served in modest quantity over a<br />\nbed of fresh, green kale.<br />\nSeafood at Louie's is always<br />\ngood\u2014in Baltimore, it has to<br />\nbe. Their hamburgers have<br />\nsubstantial burger, so you'll<br />\nnever have to ask where the<br />\nmeat is. Poultry is also served there\u2014the Chinese<br />\nlemon noodles topped with<br />\nvegetables and chicken is<br />\nespecially good.<br />\nLouie's has a separate \u2022<br />\nmenu for desserts which include some truly dreamy<br />\ntreats such as chocolate<br />\nmousse cake. All sweets are<br />\nmade fresh in the house with<br />\nreal ingredients that a grandmother would be proud of,<br />\ncream,<br />\nwhipped<br />\nlike<br />\nrasberry jelly and fresh fruits.<br />\n\u2014AP<br />\nTAVERNA ATHENA. Pratt<br />\nStreet Pavilion, Harborplace.<br />\n547-8900. All major credit<br />\ncards. ****$$$<br />\nGreek cuisine, unfortunately, is little known compared to that of Italy. Yet<br />\nGreece, while being the<br />\ncradle of Western civilization,<br />\nis also home to a multitude<br />\nof mouthwatering dishes.<br />\nOne of the most popular<br />\nGreek<br />\nrestaurants<br />\nin<br />\nBaltimore is the Taverna<br />\nAthena.<br />\nLocated at the Harborplace, Taverna Athena<br />\nshares with its neighboring<br />\nrestaurants a good view of<br />\nthe Baltimore waterfront,<br />\nespecially the 1812-era<br />\nfrigate USS Constellation.<br />\nDuring warm days, there is<br />\ndining outside and the pulldown windows are opened<br />\nto let indoor diners smell the<br />\nsalt air of the harbor. The indoor restaurant seats about<br />\nsixty, so on weekends reservations are recommended.<br />\nThe atmosphere inside is unmistakably Greek, with the<br />\nbackground music being<br />\nGreek folk songs and<br />\ndances. The service is<br />\ngenerally good.<br />\nTaverna Athena offers a<br />\nfull range of Greek food and<br />\nusually has a few weekly<br />\nspecials to boot. Prices are<br />\non the expensive side; a full<br />\nmeal (drinks, dinner, dessert,<br />\netc.) for one person costs<br />\nbetween eleven and eighteen dollars. However, the<br />\nquality of the food is excellent, as I have never had<br />\nreason to complain from any<br />\nof my dozen or so visits<br />\nthere. Everything considered, if one has the<br />\nmoney to spend, the Taverna Athena is a prime place<br /><br />\nto go for exceptionally good<br />\ncuisine. Sunday through<br />\nThursday, the Taverna is<br />\nopen from 11:30 a.m. to 11<br />\np.m.: Fridays and Saturdays,<br />\nhours last to 1 a.m. \u2014HIJ<br />\nTHE MUSEUM CAFE. Art<br />\nMuseum Drive. 235-3930.<br />\nMC, V, AE.<br />\nAccepts<br />\n***$$$<br />\nIt is unusual to find<br />\nanything but art in an art<br />\nmuseum\u2014especially a fine<br />\nrestaurant. The Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art is home of<br />\nthe Museum Cafe, a small,<br />\nbut interesting place. The<br />\nmenu is somewhat unorthodox, and, well, \"artsy.\"<br />\nThe juxtaposition of what<br />\nseem to be incompatible<br />\nfoods gives the cafe novelty, if nothing else. However<br />\nunconventional the fare, it is<br />\nwell prepared and quite<br />\ngood.<br />\nThe atmosphere of the<br />\ncafe is enhanced by its location within the BMA. It is this<br />\nproximity - with great art<br />\nwhich lends the cafe its<br />\noriginality, and sets the<br />\ncreative tone of the place.<br />\nThis has another, purely<br />\npractical advantage; one<br />\ncan roam around in the<br />\nmuseum and then enjoy a<br />\nnice lunch or dinner without<br />\nhaving to drive to two<br />\nseparate locations. At<br />\nHopkins, this can be<br />\nespecially important if you<br />\ndon't have a car.<br />\nIn all, the Museum Cafe is<br />\na nice place to go if you have<br />\na taste for the unconventional. The combination of a<br />\nmuseum visit and restaurant<br />\nmeal makes for an interesting diversion, or<br />\nelegant date.

Every weekend, the Charm City Comedy Club features nationally recognized comics from Los<br />\nAngeles and New York City. The narrow room, on the third<br />\nfloor of Winchester's, seats 130, allowing close interaction<br />\nwith each performer. Exposed brick walls and wood floors<br />\nare the main components of its comfortable atmosphere.<br />\nA show normally lasts one and a half hours and consists<br />\nof three performers. The emcee is often a local comic or<br />\nsomeone who does college circuits. Next comes the<br />\nfeatured act and finally the evening's headlines.<br />\nPerformances are Friday evenings at 8:30 and 10:30, and<br />\nSaturdays at 7:30, 9:45 and 12:00. Be sure to make your<br />\nrecervations early, especially for Saturday shows. Cover<br />\ncharges are $7.50 per person for Friday and Saturday'<br />\nmidnight show. Early shows on Saturday are $8.50. Ther<br />\nis a two beverage minimum added on to the cover for all<br />\nshows.<br />\nA party of two can expect an average bill of $30.

The impact<br />\nwill cause the block to bend in the<br />\ndirection in which the fist is moving. As the block is bent it is<br />\ndeformed: the upper half is compressed, the lower half stretched.<br />\nBecause wood and concrete are<br />\nweaker under tension than they<br />\nare under compression, the block<br />\nstarts to crack at the bottom surface.

Up<br />\nto this time, the only alternative<br />\nhad been contact lenses.<br />\nNow, a new surgical technique<br />\nis freeing thousands from the<br />\nphysical and psychological<br />\nburdens traditionally associated<br />\nwith eyeglasses. This procedure,<br />\noriginally developed by a Soviet<br />\nsurgeoa named Svyatoslav<br />\nFyodorov, is called radial<br />\nkeratotomy. As its name implies,<br />\nthe surgery involves incisions in<br />\nthe cornea, oriented outward<br />\nfrom its center like the spokes of<br />\na wheel.<br />\nThe majority of eyeglass<br />\nwearers are myopic, or nearsighted. They can see objects<br />\nclose to them clearly but have<br />\ntrouble discerning things some<br />\ndistance away. Myopia is<br />\nmeasured on a proportional scale.<br />\nFor instance, M, who has 20/40<br />\nvision, can read a poster from 20<br />\nfeet which P, who has 20/20 vision, can discern at 40.<br />\nThe process of seeing is simple. Light passes through the cornea and lens and is reflected back<br />\nto the retinal wall. The spot<br /><br />\nwhere the image is projected on<br />\nthe retina is called the focal point<br />\nThe position of the point depends<br />\nupon the distance between the<br />\nlens and the retina, the curvature<br />\nof the lens, and the angle at which<br />\nlight rays enter the eye.<br />\nIn nearsighted eyes, the focal<br />\npoint ends up forward of the<br />\nretina. As a result, a blurry image is sent via the optic nerve to<br />\nthe brain. Those with 20/20 vision have a focal point directly on<br />\nthe retina and are termed emmetropic. Corrective lenses,<br />\nwhether they be glasses or contact lenses, change the angle at<br />\nwhich light rays enter the eye and<br />\nbring the focal point closer to the<br />\nretinal wall.<br />\nRadial keratotomy acts on the<br />\nsame principle: the surgeon alters<br />\nthe eye's configuration, changing<br />\nthe angle at which light rays enter<br />\nthe eye. In a 30 minute outpatient<br />\nvisit, the surgeon makes from 4<br />\nto 16 cuts in the subject's cornea.<br />\nAs these incisions heal, the cornea flattens. The angle incidence<br />\nis changed, and vision approximates emmetropia. The surgery<br />\ncosts about $1500 per eye.<br />\nIn the most detailed study of<br />\nradial keratotomy to date, a National Eye Institute-funded team<br />\nfollowed the surgery and<br /><br />\nrecovery of 435 patients. The<br />\nNEI study proved one point:<br />\nradial keratotomy works, and<br />\nworks well, for many of those<br />\nwho elect for the surgery. After<br />\nthree years, 51 percent of the test<br />\ngroup subjects had 20/20<br />\nvision\u2014quite a success story for<br />\nradial keratotomy, given that 99<br />\npercent of the subjects began with<br />\nvision 20/50 or worse, and almost<br />\nhalf originally had vision worse<br />\nthan 20/200. Those who experienced the greatest improvement were moderately nearsighted to begin with.<br />\nThe biggest drawback to the<br />\nsurgery has been it's unpredictability. Each eye is unique, and<br />\nsurgeons have difficulty foreseeing how a given eye will respond<br />\nto radial keratotomy. As the<br />\nnumbers show, not everyone's<br />\nmyopia is alleviated. Approximately 16 percent of the test subjects in the NEI study actually<br />\nended up over-corrected, or farsighted. Repeat surgery on the<br />\nsame eye was even less predictable. Says the NE! report: \"We<br />\ndo not know which individuals<br />\nwill require modification of the<br />\nsurgical technique.\"<br />\n. There have been other detrimental effects linked to the<br />\nsurgery. Sporadic cases of dou-<br /><br />\nble vision (caused by one nearsighted eye and one farsighted<br />\neye) have been reported. A small<br />\npercentage of subjects have found<br />\nthat their vision deteriorates from<br />\n20/20 to 20/30 or worse by nighttime: Subjects whose vision was<br />\nnot sufficiently improved to allow<br />\nthem to discard their glasses<br />\nfound that the cornea's new shape<br />\nprevented them from wearing<br />\ntheir contact lenses, meaning they<br />\nwere forced to put on the frames<br />\nthey had hoped to escape.<br />\nWhen their pupils dilated in<br />\ndarkness, some subjects saw the<br />\ncorneal scars as a starburst, for<br />\nexample, in the headlights of the<br />\napproaching car. It was concern<br />\nover this glare and oscillation of<br />\nvisual lucidity which prompted a<br />\nSeptember 1985 Air Force decree<br />\nprohibiting those who had<br />\nundergone radial keratotomy<br />\nfrom enlisting.<br />\nThe most serious potential problem, according to optholmologists, is delayed bacterial<br />\nkeratitis, a violent infection at the<br />\noperation site. In spite of these<br />\npotential effects, none of the subjects in the National Eye Institute<br />\nstudy suffered a major vision<br />\nimpairment.<br />\nWithin the professional realm,<br />\nthe surgery is still looked upon as<br /><br />\nrisky. In August of 1985, the<br />\nAmerican Academy of Opthalmology (AAO) said the procedure had \"uncertain consequences.\" While the NEI's report<br />\nis generally favorable, some opthalmologists say the study can<br />\nonly be considered incomplete.<br />\nAlthough it analyzed the patient's<br />\nprogress after three years, detractors say that the cornea can take<br />\nup to five years to heal. Some opthalmologists suggest the latent<br />\nside effects of radial keratotomy<br />\nmay not appear until many years<br />\nafter the surgery. At present,<br />\nmany opthalmologists are loathe<br />\nto operate on a structurally sound<br />\neye. Only ten percent of U.S. opthalmologists will even perform<br />\nthe simple procedure.<br />\nIn any case, those hoping to<br />\nescape the tyranny of glasses by<br />\ntaking their chances with the<br />\nsurgery still face Nature's last<br />\nlaugh: near vision wanes in all of<br />\nus during middle age, but those<br />\nwith normal vision experience<br />\nthis decline about ten years<br />\nsooner than their nearsighted<br />\ncounterparts. So, while a successful radial keratotomy may<br />\nspeed your glasses' departure<br />\nnow, it may also, in the long run,<br />\nhasten their return.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/23<br /><br />\nSports<br /><br />\nJays gun down Army, 9-5<br />\nMorrill and Crawford supply ammunition for sixth straight<br />\nby Steven Silber<br />\nJohns Hopkins lacrosse<br />\ndefeated Army 9-5 last Saturday<br />\nat Michie Stadium in West Point,<br />\nN.Y.

I was part of a class to<br />\nrebuild a poor program to a competitive team in the NCAA tournament. It's not just soccer<br />\nthough. More money and<br />\nrecruiting put towards soccer and<br />\nother sports has helped those<br />\nprograms to be more competitive<br />\nLacrosse has been and always<br />\nwill be competitive.<br />\n\"Hockey is getting more and<br />\nmore money from alumni contributions and have been<br />\nupgrading their schedule each<br />\nyear. Hopefully, there'll be a varsity hockey team here one day.<br />\n\"Anytime the school has a<br />\ncotninittment to build up its<br />\nvarious athletic programs, these<br />\nprograms are going to do well.<br />\nThe soccer team has made a<br />\nquantum leap in stature. It will<br />\ncontinue to do well because of the<br />\nactive recruiting and the popularity of the team, putting pressure<br />\non the team to play better with<br />\neach new year. Another key to<br />\nthe team's success is good alumni relations.\"<br />\nWorking hard seems inherent<br />\nin Jack. \"When I go out, whether<br />\nin practice or a game, I go out,<br />\nexcuse the cliche, to do my best<br />\nand I hope that it rubs off on my<br />\nteammates. Having been cocaptain for soccer and now<br />\nlacrosse, I feel I have a respon-<br /><br />\nsibility to set a good example<br />\nwhen I'm out there. As a result,<br />\nI feel more pressure to work very<br />\nhard.\"<br />\nHowever, he is human; he has<br />\nhad to work hard for the respect<br />\nof other players: \"I was recruited<br />\nas a soccer player, not as a<br />\nlacrosse player. When I first got<br />\nhere, I felt it was one of the low<br />\npoints of my career. I hadn't yet<br />\nproven myself. I was playing soccer and at the same time was worried about trying out for lacrosse.<br />\nI've gotten a great deal from<br />\nlacrosse. I wasn't recruited and<br />\nCoach Zimmerman had the option of giving me a tryout. That<br />\nwas great, but I still went through<br />\na lot of pressure. Quitting to<br />\nrelease the pressure held some<br />\nappeal. However, once I did prove myself, there was a great deal<br />\nof satisfaction.<br />\n\"Injuring my knee was the<br />\nother low point. It was very<br />\nfrustrating, whereas the pressure<br />\nwhen I first got here was frightening. However, I knew that all I<br />\nhad to do was maintain a positive<br />\nattitude and work hard at<br />\nrehabilitation in order to recover.<br />\n\"I think that epitomizes teams<br />\nhere. For example, last year in<br />\nlacrosse and two years ago in soccer both teams lost games they<br />\nknow they shouldn't have, but<br />\nnever gave up. They maintained<br />\na positive attitude.\" To readers<br />\non D-level at MSE library, the<br />\nlacrosse team finished the year as<br />\nnational champions.<br />\n\"Lacrosse is always exciting.<br />\nAnytime you're on a national<br />\nchampionship team, it's a great<br />\nfeeling. Last year especially. And<br />\nin soccer, being a part of a<br />\nrebuilding program that got to<br />\nplay the number one team is also<br />\na great feeling.\" Jack is especially lucky because he has this<br />\nseason for a fourth national<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nLacrosse has changed, though, to<br />\nJack. \"Over the past few years,<br />\nthe team has gotten closer, both<br />\nto the school and within itself.<br />\nThere are more lacrosse players<br />\nthat compete in other sports for<br />\nHopkins and this brings the teams<br />\ncloser to the school.

The<br />\ncoaches claim it was due to having only four seniors but I don't<br />\nthink that's true. We have such a<br />\nstrong core of juniors and<br />\nsophomores.

The Hopkins Men's Track<br />\nTeam silenced its critics by<br />\ndefeating 3 of4 opponents in two<br />\ntri-meets on Saturday and<br />\nWednesday at Hopkins to raise its<br />\nseason record to a surprising 4-3<br />\nmark. The only loss suffered by<br />\nthe team was on Saturday when<br />\nthe defending MAC Track Champion Ursinus Bears defeated the<br />\nJays. However, the Jays did not<br />\nlose without presenting a<br />\nlegitimate challenge to the Bears,<br />\nwho have not lost a dual or trimeet in the last two years. On the<br />\nstrength of five first place and<br />\nfour second place finishes in the<br />\nrunning events, the Jays were only six points behind the Bears<br />\nupon entering the field event<br />\ncompetition and the Jays seemed<br />\nto be in an ideal position to pull<br />\na major upset. Unfortunately, the<br />\nBears, led by 15 points from their<br />\nthree time All American in the<br />\nJavelin, Discus and Shot Put,<br />\npulled away and handily defeated<br />\nthe Jays 104.5 to 68.5. Loyola<br />\nCollege also competed in the trimeet but could only manage to<br />\nscore 8 points as their men's track<br />\nprogram is in its first year and is<br />\nstill developing.<br />\nThe Jays were led in point scoring by freshman Matt Hannon,<br />\nwho scored 10 points with two<br />\nfirst place finishes in the 110<br />\nHigh Hurdles and the 400 Intermediate Hurdles. Other first<br />\nplace finishers included senior<br />\nand Co-Captain Paul Park, who<br />\nwon the 400 meter run with a<br /><br />\ntime of 53.46, Co-Captain Scott<br />\nBaker, who won the 800 in<br />\n2:01.5 and senior Tim Marean,<br />\nwho won the 5000 with a time of<br />\n15 minutes and 37 seconds.<br />\nfreshman Mark Melia ran a personal best time by taking second<br />\nin the 1500 with a time of 4:17.5.<br />\nfreshman hurdler Tom Chiari<br />\nalso contributed 3 points to the<br />\nteam effort with second place<br />\nfinish in the 110 High Hurdles.<br />\nDespite tough competition from<br />\na talented Ursinus field team, the<br />\nJays field squad managed to score<br />\n22.5 points led by a first place<br />\nfinish by Max Polska in the Triple Jump. Glenn Sabin added two<br />\nsecond place finishes in the Shot<br />\nPut and Discus and the multitalented Eric Hastings furthered<br />\nthe teams effort by scoring the<br />\nJavelin (2nd), Discus (3rd), and<br />\nShot Put and Triple Jump (4th).<br />\nOn Wednesday, the Jays expanded upon their newly-found<br />\nsuccess by defeating both<br />\nWestern Maryland and York College. The team was led by an impressive showing by its distant<br />\nteam, which scored 26 of a possible 33 points. Although the<br />\ndistance men did not sweep any<br />\none event totally, it took first, second, and third place in the 1500<br />\nand 800 meter runs. This same<br />\nfeat was accomplished by the Jays<br />\nin the Javelin and Triple Jump<br />\nevents. However, the most<br />\nsignificant accomplishment of the<br />\nday might have been the depth<br />\nand team effort exhibited by the<br />\nJays on the whole. The tracksters<br />\nwon 6 of 17 first places, 9 of 17<br />\nsecond places and an amazing 13.<br /><br />\nof 17 third places. All of these,<br />\nplus five fourth place finishes,<br />\ncombined to give the Jays a team<br />\nscore 85, which was comfortably<br />\nahead of both Western Maryland<br />\n(52 points) and York (46 points).<br />\nLeading the way for Hopkins in<br />\nscoring was freshman Eric<br />\nHastings, who scored a first in the<br />\nJavelin, a second in the Triple<br />\nJump and two thirds in the Shot<br />\nPut and Discus for a total of 12<br />\npoints for the day. Weightman<br />\nGlenn Sabin added 9 points with<br />\nthree second place finished in the<br /><br />\nShot Put. Discus, and Javelin.<br />\nBoth Mark Melia and Scott Baker<br />\nran well, scoring 8 points each<br />\nwith first and second place<br />\nfinishes. Mark ran a 4:17.3 to<br />\nwin the 1500 and later returned<br />\nto take second in the 5000, while<br />\nScott took second in the 1500 and<br />\nwon the 800.

I<br />\nmean, here is a team that, in any<br />\nother year but 1987, would probably have finished third in their<br />\ndivision. Yet, because they<br />\nplayed excellent baseball in last<br />\nyear's postseason, the Twins' upper management has deluded<br />\nitself into thinking that it has all<br />\nthe necessary pieces to win the<br />\nWorld Series again in 1988. Someone should tell Andy MacPhail<br />\nand Tom Kelly that Steve<br />\nCarlton, Tippy Martinez, and Joe<br />\nNiekro aren't going to lead the<br />\nteam to the top of the mountain<br />\nthis year.<br />\n\u2014What I want to know is,<br />\nwhen will people stop belittling<br />\nthe efforts of Darryl Strawberry?<br />\nSure, he's a head case, but as a<br />\nbaseball player he's phenomenal.<br />\nIn fact, I think he's a better offensive force than Don Mattingly. Darryl has more power, is a<br />\nbetter judge of the strike zone,<br />\nand steals more bases in a season<br />\nthan Mattingly will in his career.<br />\nComparing their best seasons<br />\n(Mattingly's 1985 vs. Straw's<br />\n1987), the only significant advantage Mattingly has over<br />\nStrawberry is in RBI (145 vs.<br /><br />\n104). There are two obvious<br />\nreasons for this: 1) Rickey<br />\nHenderson and 2) Opportunities.<br />\nIn 1987, Strawberry had 236 atbats with men on base. In 1985,<br />\nMattingly had 315 at-bats with<br />\nmen on base, nearly 80 more than<br />\nStrawberry. How the hell is<br />\nStrawberry going to drive in men<br />\nthat aren't there?<br />\n\u2014What I want to know is, what<br />\nare Rick Cerone, Bill Buckner,<br />\nand Steve Kemp still doing in the<br />\nmajors?<br />\n\u2014 What I want to know is,<br />\nwhen will Jim Rice rein in his ego<br />\nfor the good of the team? If the<br />\nfuture of the Red Sox lies with<br />\noutfielders Greenwell and Burks,<br />\nand if Evans at this point is a better fielder than Rice (both points<br />\nare very true), then it behooves<br />\nRice to volunteer for DH duty.<br />\nBut Rice, following in the<br />\nfootsteps of Dave Parker, sullenly<br />\nrefuses to accomodate the team,<br />\nwhile John McNamara, following<br />\nin the tradition of George Bush,<br />\nis much too much of a wimp to<br />\nchange Rice's mind.<br />\n\u2014What I want to know is,<br />\nwould Sandy Koufax be able to<br />\nshut out this year's Yankees?<br />\n\u2014What I want to know is, how<br />\nmany Hall of Famers have I had<br />\nthe privilege of watching?
