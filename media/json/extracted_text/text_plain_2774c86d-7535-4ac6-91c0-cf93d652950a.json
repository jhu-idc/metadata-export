Americans Active<br />\nDeclaring that the influence of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene extends into the farthest<br />\nprovinces of China, Dr. Edward<br />\nH. Hume, dean and professor of<br />\nmedicine in the Hunan Yale College of Medicine at Changsha,<br />\nChina, struck a popular note when<br />\nhe addressed the student body at<br />\nthe assembly last Thursday.<br />\nThe word \"revolution\" was the<br />\nkeynote of Dr. Hume's speech. He<br />\npointed out several instances of<br />\nrevolution with which Americans<br />\nare most familiar, and then spoke<br />\nabout the Boxer uprising in 1900,<br />\nin which an attempt was made to<br />\nstop western aggression in China.<br />\nDuring the revolt, a young corporal, who saw an American college student executed as the result of helping some missionaries<br />\nto escape, was converted to Christianity. Today the corporal is General Fong, who has a wide reputation as the Christian general, and<br />\nwho is. one of the two leading generals in China.<br />\nThe speaker linked the American<br />\nUniversity Movement with these<br />\nrevolutions, and showed to what<br />\nextent it is a revolution in the lives<br />\nof the Chinese, bound by superstition, fearful of western interference and control, and still somewhat restricted by the old educational system, which was abolished<br />\nin 1905. The leaders of the movement to establish branches of<br />\nAmerican universities in China<br />\nwere Elisha Goodman, of Amherst,<br />\nand Samuel Brown, of Yale, who<br />\nbegan their activities in 1832. Dr.<br />\nHume was the first American physician to stay permanently in Hunan, a province which is especially<br />\nhostile to foreign enterprises.<br />\nDr. Hume gave several examples of the superstition and great<br />\nlearning which exist side by side<br />\nin China. Although they themselves have a medical knowledge<br />\nwhich is the product of several<br />\nthousand years' experience, the<br />\nthy Chinese are extremely superstitious, especially in regard to the<br />\nevil spirits, which they believe exercise a powerful influence over<br />\nthe lives of human beings. For example, they will not allow the both'<br />\nof. a person who died away from<br />\nhome to be brought home for burial because they fear evil spirits<br />\nwill enter the dwelling with the<br />\nbody. If possible, a dangerously<br />\nill person is brought home to die.<br />\nThis enabled Dr. Hume's hospital<br />\nto preserve for several years the<br />\nunusual record of no deaths.<br />\nDr. Hume concluded his address<br />\nby expressing a desire to see more<br />\nAmerican universities take up the<br />\nwork now being done by Hopkins,<br />\nYale, Princeton and a few others.<br />\nIn the afternoon Dr. Hume gave<br />\nanother address in the C. E. Hall<br />\nbefore a large audience, in which<br />\nhe stated that conditions in China<br />\nwere both discouraging and hopeful. The four discouraging features are political disorder, financial instability, a lack of strong<br />\nleaders, and the proximity of Japan. Four hopeful signs, on the<br />\nother hand, are the national health<br />\nmovement, social reforms, educational progress, and the elimination<br />\nof many objectionable customs,<br />\nsuch as polygamy, opium-eating<br />\nCoatinael on page 4, col. 2<br />\n<br />\nCOSMOPOLITAN CLUB RE- SOPHOMORES HOLD CLASS<br />\nMEETING<br />\nORGANIZED<br />\nTo revive the one-time CosmoThe Sophomores met on Depolitan Club which was com- cember 21 in the Civil Engineerposed of foreign students of the ing Hall.

Five others became comfortably<br />\noff and found themselves after twenty<br />\nyears at the small yacht and chauffeur<br />\nstage. The other ninety-four presumably congregate in the great section of<br />\nthe American people who drive their<br />\nown Buicks to the golf club. In other<br />\nwords, dreaming about being a rich<br />\nman is one thing, and making the grade<br />\nis something else again.\"<br />\nYet the ninety-four presumably work<br />\njust as hard as the sumptuous six. Their<br />\nbusiness is the axis on which a small<br />\nand uninteresting world revolves. They<br />\nhave become devotees of the dollar<br />\nand when that fickle deity deserts, have<br />\nnowhere else to turn.

Americans Active<br />\nDeclaring that the influence of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene extends into the farthest<br />\nprovinces of China, Dr. Edward<br />\nH. Hume, dean and professor of<br />\nmedicine in the Hunan Yale College of Medicine at Changsha,<br />\nChina, struck a popular note when<br />\nhe addressed the student body at<br />\nthe assembly last Thursday.<br />\nThe word \"revolution\" was the<br />\nkeynote of Dr. Hume's speech. He<br />\npointed out several instances of<br />\nrevolution with which Americans<br />\nare most familiar, and then spoke<br />\nabout the Boxer uprising in 1900,<br />\nin which an attempt was made to<br />\nstop western aggression in China.<br />\nDuring the revolt, a young corporal, who saw an American college student executed as the result of helping some missionaries<br />\nto escape, was converted to Christianity. Today the corporal is General Fong, who has a wide reputation as the Christian general, and<br />\nwho is. one of the two leading generals in China.<br />\nThe speaker linked the American<br />\nUniversity Movement with these<br />\nrevolutions, and showed to what<br />\nextent it is a revolution in the lives<br />\nof the Chinese, bound by superstition, fearful of western interference and control, and still somewhat restricted by the old educational system, which was abolished<br />\nin 1905. The leaders of the movement to establish branches of<br />\nAmerican universities in China<br />\nwere Elisha Goodman, of Amherst,<br />\nand Samuel Brown, of Yale, who<br />\nbegan their activities in 1832. Dr.<br />\nHume was the first American physician to stay permanently in Hunan, a province which is especially<br />\nhostile to foreign enterprises.<br />\nDr. Hume gave several examples of the superstition and great<br />\nlearning which exist side by side<br />\nin China. Although they themselves have a medical knowledge<br />\nwhich is the product of several<br />\nthousand years' experience, the<br />\nthy Chinese are extremely superstitious, especially in regard to the<br />\nevil spirits, which they believe exercise a powerful influence over<br />\nthe lives of human beings. For example, they will not allow the both'<br />\nof. a person who died away from<br />\nhome to be brought home for burial because they fear evil spirits<br />\nwill enter the dwelling with the<br />\nbody. If possible, a dangerously<br />\nill person is brought home to die.<br />\nThis enabled Dr. Hume's hospital<br />\nto preserve for several years the<br />\nunusual record of no deaths.<br />\nDr. Hume concluded his address<br />\nby expressing a desire to see more<br />\nAmerican universities take up the<br />\nwork now being done by Hopkins,<br />\nYale, Princeton and a few others.<br />\nIn the afternoon Dr. Hume gave<br />\nanother address in the C. E. Hall<br />\nbefore a large audience, in which<br />\nhe stated that conditions in China<br />\nwere both discouraging and hopeful. The four discouraging features are political disorder, financial instability, a lack of strong<br />\nleaders, and the proximity of Japan. Four hopeful signs, on the<br />\nother hand, are the national health<br />\nmovement, social reforms, educational progress, and the elimination<br />\nof many objectionable customs,<br />\nsuch as polygamy, opium-eating<br />\nCoatinael on page 4, col. 2<br /><br />\nCOSMOPOLITAN CLUB RE- SOPHOMORES HOLD CLASS<br />\nMEETING<br />\nORGANIZED<br />\nTo revive the one-time CosmoThe Sophomores met on Depolitan Club which was com- cember 21 in the Civil Engineerposed of foreign students of the ing Hall.

Five others became comfortably<br />\noff and found themselves after twenty<br />\nyears at the small yacht and chauffeur<br />\nstage. The other ninety-four presumably congregate in the great section of<br />\nthe American people who drive their<br />\nown Buicks to the golf club. In other<br />\nwords, dreaming about being a rich<br />\nman is one thing, and making the grade<br />\nis something else again.\"<br />\nYet the ninety-four presumably work<br />\njust as hard as the sumptuous six. Their<br />\nbusiness is the axis on which a small<br />\nand uninteresting world revolves. They<br />\nhave become devotees of the dollar<br />\nand when that fickle deity deserts, have<br />\nnowhere else to turn. Jammed in a<br />\ndull, straight rut of business they can<br />\nnever leave the road and jump the fence<br />\ninto finer fields of life.
