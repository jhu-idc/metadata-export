I don't<br />\nthink it's proper. . . I'm just not<br />\nprepared to do that. I'm sorry.\"<br />\nA fter repeated demands of<br />\n\"Why don't you write a letter of<br />\nprotest to Iran?\", he finally<br />\ncountered, \"I just might do<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nIn response to demands to<br />\ndrop charges against the<br />\nprotestors, Muller reiterated his<br />\nstand: \"The University does not<br />\npress charges. The arrests were<br />\nmade and then it becomes a<br />\nmatter for the States Attorney.\"<br />\nWhen urged to use his personal<br />\ninfluence and the University's<br />\nprestige in the matter, he<br />\nanswered, \"If the charges were<br />\nwithdrawn, and they (members<br />\nof the security force) were<br />\nexposed to suits, I think that<br />\nwould be an irresponsible act. In<br />\n<br />\nany case, whatever I do or don't<br />\ndo in this case, I would certainly<br />\nnever say anything public (about<br />\nthe action).\"<br />\nHe refused to directly<br />\nacknowledge error in the matter,<br />\nbut did take full responsibility<br />\nfor the decision: \". . . there's<br />\nonly one person to blame, and<br />\nthat's me. It was never forced on<br />\nthe University. . . There was a<br />\nmistake in judgement on my part<br />\nthat people would distinguish<br />\nbetween her (Princess Ashraf)<br />\nand the government.\"<br />\nMuller cited two reasons for<br />\nselecting Ashraf as the recipient<br />\nof the honorary degree.<br />\n'We wanted some<br />\nacknowledgement of Hopkins'<br />\nmedical tradition. . . The Iranian<br />\nprogram is the largest<br />\ninternational activity we are<br />\ninvolved in . . .\" Ashraf was<br />\nchosen because of her position as<br />\ntitular head of the Pahlavi<br />\nMedical Center in Tehran.<br />\n\". . .plus the fact that she's a<br />\nwoman--she was active in the<br />\nInternational Women's Year. She<br />\nhas been a leading figure in<br />\nstarting up and funding the<br />\nadvocacy of women's rights.\"<br />\nMuller was repeatedly attacked<br />\nfor the entire process of awarding<br />\nhonorary degrees. \"Why wasn't a<br />\nthorough investigation run on her<br />\nbackground,\" asked one student.<br />\nHe explained that \"these<br />\nhonorary degrees are largely<br />\nsymbolic. We don't run checks<br />\nnormally. . . There are no stated<br />\ncriteria (for the honorary<br />\ndegrees). It may well be that as a<br />\nresult of this, the faculty may<br />\ndevelop some.\"<br />\n\"It may be just as well that we<br />\ncannot award degrees to public<br />\nfigures. I'm going to be much<br />\nmore cautious about public<br />\nfigures of any kind.\"<br />\nMuller denied as \"simply<br />\nuntrue,\" all allegations of<br />\nmonetary reward from Iran.\"We<br />\n<br />\nhaven't received gifts from Iran,<br />\nand we don't expect to receive<br />\nmoney from Iran.\"<br />\n\"If my action in awarding the<br />\nhonorary degree insulted any<br />\npeople in the university<br />\ncommunity, I apologize. On<br />\ndropping charges, I have already<br />\nsaid that I will not say anything<br />\npublicly.\"<br />\n\"I don't mind being accused of<br />\nmaking a mistake--but I have not<br />\nlied, and I don't intend to.

In what ways do you intend<br />\nto maintain contact with the<br />\nundergraduate student body,<br />\nafter you graduate, to serve in<br />\nthe capacity of a Young Trustee?<br />\nDON STRADER 1. The three<br />\nmost pressing student concerns I<br />\nwould hope to confront in the<br />\narea of educational policy as a<br />\nYoung trustee are<br />\ncommunication, the offering of<br />\nsufficient courses that students<br />\nrequire and are interested in, and<br />\nthe library. As I said in my<br />\nstatement of candidacy, I feel<br />\n\"there is a definite need for<br />\nresponsive action on student<br />\ninput to the decision-making<br />\nProcess.\" At the present time<br />\nthere are various shortages in<br />\ncourse offerings in some areas. As<br />\na young trustee I would seek to<br />\nidentify these shortages and try<br />\nto find ways to rectify them.<br />\nDuring Intersession the<br />\nShortage of courses in general<br />\nresulted in crowded classes and<br />\nstudents who could not find a<br />\ncourse to take without a lot of<br />\nsearching because many were<br />\n\"full\". In addition students<br />\ntaking courses that had large<br />\nnumber of participants and a<br />\nlarge volume of reserve reading<br />\nfound that the readings were<br />\nimpossible to obtain as the<br />\nreserve room was closed about as<br />\nmuch as it was open during<br />\n1 ntersession. Thus, even when<br />\ncourses are offered they do not<br />\nalways receive adequate support<br />\nby the university. To continue<br />\nwith what I mentioned as the<br />\nthird \"pressing problem\", the<br />\nlibrary has a problem with the<br />\novercrowding of books and<br />\nPeople. Perhaps the library's lack<br />\nof _space with a lack of money<br />\nhas resulted in the library's poor<br />\nacquisition program lately. Some<br />\nstudents I have talked to lately<br />\nsay they can no longer find<br />\nadequate material for their<br />\nresearch in what the JHU<br />\nCircular calls \"the major<br />\nresearch, teaching, and cultural<br />\nresources of the University . . .<br />\n(and) one of the major research<br />\nlibraries of the country. 2. On<br />\nrelation to question 2, I pick<br />\nanswer (a), but hope that<br />\nmoderate increases in \u2022tuition<br />\nalong with much study of fiscal<br />\nproblems and solutions can result<br />\nin a balanced budget. 3. It is<br />\ndifficult to determine which are<br />\nthe best ways, \"to maintain<br />\ncontact with the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body, after you<br />\ngraduate,\" in advance without a<br />\ntrial period. However at the<br />\npresent time I plan attending<br />\nstudent functions and intend to<br />\nsolicit suggestions from students<br />\nas well as others.,<br />\n<br />\nED BROKANS 1. Hopkins<br />\nshould expand and diversify as<br />\nthe opportunities arise. I support<br />\nand will work for the<br />\nestablishment of a Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Law, and School for<br />\nthe Arts. The implementation of<br />\nsuch policies will lead to a more<br />\ndiverse student body and an<br />\nenriched intellectual<br />\nenvironment, thus attracting<br />\nscholars who are less science<br />\noriented. It will enhance<br />\nHopkins' prestige and further our<br />\ntradition as the first true<br />\nuniversity. We must fully explore'<br />\nthe advantages of affiliation with<br />\nthe Peabody Institute, and act to<br />\nrealize Dr. Eisenhower's goal of a<br />\nSchool of Law. Such positive<br />\nsteps are the main responsilbility<br />\nof the Young Trustees in the area<br />\nof educational policy. Other<br />\nacademic concerns (i.e.,<br />\nplus-minus grading, pass-fail<br />\noption) are matters to be<br />\nconfronted by the student<br />\nrepresentatives of the CUS and<br />\nAcademic Council. The Board of<br />\nTrustees formulates educational<br />\npolicy, while these committees<br />\nare charged with its<br />\nimplementation. 2. 'Moderate<br />\nincrease' or 'sizeable increase' is a<br />\nmatter of semantics: any increase<br />\nis sure to have an adverse impact<br />\non some students. Wheras a $100<br />\nhike . might seem moderate to<br />\nsome, it would be devastating to<br />\nothers. The critical choice,<br />\ntherefore, is between an<br />\noperating deficit and a balanced<br />\nbudget. Sound fiscal policy<br />\nmandates the latter. Deficits<br />\nprovide only temporary relief,<br />\nbut lead to long-term disaster.<br />\nEndowments will drop,<br />\nfund-raising will become<br />\ndifficult, and the consequences<br />\nwill be severe. A balanced budget<br />\nmeans Hopkins will survive. I am<br />\nnot convinced, however, that<br />\ntuition increases are required for<br />\na balanced budget. Instead,<br />\nnon-essential portions of the<br />\nbudget, particularly those in<br />\nadministration, should be cut<br />\nfirst. Only as an absolute last<br />\nresort will I consider voting for<br />\nany tuition increase. And then, I<br />\nwill have to be assured of a<br />\nconcomitant increase in financial<br />\naid. 3. During my 4-year term<br />\nas Young Trustee, I plan to stay<br />\nin and around the<br />\nWashington area. My philosophy:<br />\nthe closer to -lopldns\u2014the better.<br />\nFrequent trips to Homewood will<br />\nallow personal communication<br />\nwith the \u2018students, faculty and<br />\nemployees I have rfiet during my<br />\nfour years here. I feel a Young<br />\nTrustee must remain in close<br />\ncontact with Hopkins'- students<br />\n(more than 3 or 4 visits a year),<br />\nand be ever diligent so as not to<br />\ndrift away from his<br />\nresponsibilities. In addition, I will<br />\naccept correspondence from all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who wish to discuss<br />\nany problems. I will be a visible<br />\nYoung Trustee.<br />\n<br />\nAPRIL MORENO 1. Two<br />\nacademic areas of personal<br />\nconcern are the fine arts and<br />\nfundamental biology. Firstly, I<br />\npropose an integrated<br />\ncurriculum, using existing<br />\ndepartments as building blocks.<br />\nStudio art, for example, could be<br />\n<br />\noffered through the History of<br />\nArt department and would<br />\nbenefit persons interested in the<br />\nhistory of art, architecture,<br />\narcheology, and any scientific<br />\nillustration. Secondly, since<br />\nmany science majors feel<br />\nsaturated with the molecular<br />\naspects of the cell, but are<br />\ninsecure about botanical or<br />\nzoological facts, a team of<br />\npresent professors (or one new<br />\nprofessor if that were financially<br />\nfeasible) would offer a<br />\nmacrobiology course, geared to,<br />\nbut not specifically for, science<br />\nmajors. My third concern is a<br />\nbroad one. I feel it is up to the<br />\nBoard of Trustees to insure the<br />\ncredibility of these new courses<br />\nand insure their academic merit,<br />\nas well as that of the disciplines<br />\nalready present at Hopkins.<br />\n2. Although a balanced budget<br />\nis the thing that makes the world<br />\ngo around, I oppose an<br />\nimmediate tuition increase. I<br />\nfavor a three year deficit plan.<br />\nThe exact deficit must be<br />\nmonitored and partially<br />\nalleviated by stringent budget<br />\nmanagement among university<br />\ndepartments; I feel the University<br />\ncould survive slightly in the red<br />\nfor several years if the deficit did<br />\nnot escalate rapidly. If the debt<br />\nbecame insurmountable, then a<br />\ngradual tuition increase would be<br />\nnecessary, but should not be<br />\nlevied on the students without<br />\nconsideration and careful<br />\nexplanation. I do not support<br />\nannual increases, for any reason.<br />\n3. I will be living in Baltimore<br />\nfor the next two years, writing<br />\nfor one of the city newspapers.<br />\nAnyone who wants to contact<br />\nme can do so by phone or by<br />\nmail. I plan to have weekly office<br />\nhours three times monthly in<br />\nLevering and once monthly in<br />\nthe dorms, room space<br />\npermitting. I will inform all<br />\nundergrads of the times and<br />\nplaces of these hours via the<br />\ncampus mail. In addition, I will<br />\nkeep them advised on the<br />\ndecisions of the Board of<br />\nTrustees that affect<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nDAN HOLIK 1. The Johns<br />\nHopkins University has shown.<br />\nthat it can expand its curriculum<br />\nand m aintain high standards;<br />\nwitness the recent creation of the<br />\nAnthropology Department, the<br />\nHumanities and Biology Honors<br />\nPrograms, and the Bologna Year<br />\nAbroad and Public Health<br />\noptions. As a Young Trustee, I<br />\nwill continue to press for<br />\nenlargements of academic areas<br />\nof study at Homewood. The<br />\nentire community would benefit<br />\nfrom new programs in studio art<br />\nand music performance, Oriental<br />\nlanguages, Russian and Asian<br />\nstudies, film, dance and drama.<br />\nHopkins was in the vanguard of<br />\ngraduate schools in the United<br />\nStates, it must strive to remain in<br />\nthe forefronit of college<br />\neducation by always seeking new<br />\nintellectual approaches to<br />\nexplore.<br />\nAn academic expansion of the<br />\nuniversity will require that<br />\nadditional resources for study are<br />\navailable to the student body.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees must<br />\nsolicit funds for the continual<br />\n<br />\nupgrading of the physical plant<br />\nand facilities. As a Young<br />\nTrustee, I will seek funds to<br />\nenlarge the library and art<br />\n-collections of the university,<br />\nadditional lecture series,<br />\nconcerts, practice rooms and<br />\nstudent publications. I urge all<br />\nmembers of the student body to<br />\napproach the Board with requests<br />\nfor aid of this nature.<br />\nFinally, the Board of Trustees<br />\nmust seek to maintain the<br />\ninherent advantages of the size of<br />\nthe university. Independent<br />\nstudy and research, practicums,<br />\nfellowship programs, and the<br />\nin tersession offer students an<br />\nopportunity to work and relate<br />\nto others as people instead of<br />\ngraded commodities. The Board<br />\nof Trustees must set and<br />\nmaintain Hopkins' emphasis on<br />\nthe individual student. I am sure<br />\nthat most if not all students are<br />\naware that many of the<br />\nuniversity's courses and<br />\nopportunities exist in the<br />\ncatalogue but not on the campus.<br />\nAs a Young Trustee, I will try to<br />\nidentify those situations and<br />\naffect needed reforms.<br />\n2. Increases in tuition should<br />\nnot and must not be set<br />\naccording to the balance of the<br />\nHomewood Campus budget. The<br />\ntuition students now pay per<br />\nsemester covers less than half of<br />\nthe operating expenses incurred<br />\nat the Homewood campus.<br />\nIncremental increases in tuition<br />\n(for example $200 every 2 years)<br />\nwill not match the logrithmic<br />\nincreases in operating costs of the<br />\nuniversity. Since the Board of<br />\nTrustees is responsible for the<br />\nsolvency of the institution, the<br />\nYoung Trustees must be willing<br />\nto investigate any and all outside<br />\nsources of income for Hopkins in<br />\norder to defray or reduce tuition<br />\nincreases for undergraduates.<br />\n3. I intend to maintain contact<br />\nwith the undergraduate body by<br />\nall possible methods\u2014frequent<br />\nvisits, meetings with students and<br />\nstudent groups(invitations gladly<br />\naccepted), correspondence (write<br />\nme a letter, I hate to see my<br />\nempty mailbox), and reading<br />\n(each Trustee should be given a<br />\nlifetime subscription to the<br />\nNews-Letter).<br />\nI hope that the student body<br />\nwill make this task easier by<br />\ncontinuing to vigorously and<br />\nvocally press for the<br />\nimprovement of student services<br />\nat Homewood. The Board should<br />\nbe a focus point in this effort. To<br />\nthis end, I propose that the<br />\nBoard hold sessions specifically<br />\ndesigned to air student grievances<br />\nand suggestions. I am sure that<br />\nthe Trustees and the<br />\nundergraduates will gain valuable<br />\ninsight and perception\u2014to be<br />\nused for the benefit of all<br />\nconcerned.<br />\n<br />\nLEAH SEIDENFELD 1. From<br />\nthe literature, describing the<br />\nBoard of Trustees I have received<br />\nduring my candidacy, I have<br />\nlearned that unfortunately, the<br />\nBoard has little to do with<br />\neducational policy. This has been<br />\nan area where I have<br />\nconcentrated a considerable<br />\namount of energy during my<br />\nyears at Hopkins. I feel that<br />\neducational policy is one of the<br />\n<br />\nmost important realms of the<br />\nUniversity, in which<br />\nundergraduates can express their<br />\nviews. For this reason, I will<br />\nattempt, if chosen as Young<br />\nTrustee, to confront areas of<br />\nstudent concern in educaitonal<br />\npolicy in whatever manner<br />\npossible.<br />\nI see the research vs. teaching<br />\ndilemma in faculty orientation as<br />\none of the most pressing<br />\nproblems facing students here.<br />\nWhile the importance of research<br />\nis easily recognized, teaching<br />\nshould also be emphasized. It is<br />\nspecifically of concern to<br />\nundergraduates. The position of<br />\nthe University on this issue is<br />\ndecidedly slanted towards<br />\nresearch. A more common<br />\nground between these two<br />\npositions should be<br />\nattained. The departments, and<br />\nthe majors and courses they<br />\noffer, are in need of scrutiny.<br />\nThe needs of undergraduates<br />\nshould be constantly<br />\nre-evaluated, as should the<br />\neffectiveness of the departments<br />\nand their offerings to meet these<br />\nneeds.<br />\nFinally, I think that there is a<br />\ngrowing desire among the student<br />\nbody for accelerated BAMA type<br />\nprograms. This type of advanced<br />\ncourse offering should be<br />\nemphasized and the number of<br />\ndepartments offering the BA-MA<br />\ndegree increased.<br />\nThe needs and interests of the<br />\nHopkins underg,raduate student<br />\nbody should take a high priority<br />\nin academic policy<br />\nconsiderations. While I would not<br />\nbe directly involved with<br />\nscholastic concerns as a Young<br />\nTrustee, I would endeavor to<br />\nrepresent student concerns in the<br />\narea of academic policy, to the<br />\nbest of my ability. 2. It is my<br />\nopinion that many times the<br />\nHopkins undergraduate students<br />\nare forced to bear the brunt of an<br />\noverly generous budgeting<br />\nprocess, through tuition<br />\nincreases. I feel that the<br />\npossibility exists for substantial<br />\nbudgetary cuts in various sectors<br />\nof the University. Such cuts<br />\nwould eliminate or minimize<br />\ntuition increases.<br />\nThe endowment of the Arts &<br />\nSciences Division is very small.<br />\nSizeable deficits over a sustained<br />\nperiod could not be absorbed by<br />\nthis endowment. Substantial<br />\nfund-raising effotts should be<br />\nundertaken to increase the<br />\nendowment. If, because of the<br />\neconomic climate of the country,<br />\ncosts rise, the endowment should<br />\nbe able to absorbthe resultant<br />\ndeficient to some extent. The<br />\nstudents should not always be<br />\nheld responsible for making up<br />\nthe losses incurred. The<br />\nendowments of other Hopkins<br />\ndivisions are considerably higher<br />\nthan that of the Arts & Sciences<br />\nDivision. Efforts should be made<br />\nto increase the funds received by<br />\nthis sector of the University.<br />\nI would favor a moderate<br />\nincrease in tuition resulting in an<br />\noperating budget deficit, over a<br />\nsizeable tuition increase resulting<br />\nin a balanced budget, if an<br />\nincrease was absolutely<br />\nnecessary. However, the<br />\ncurrent state of the endowment<br />\ncould not sustain a deficit in the<br />\n<br />\nsee TRUSTEES, page 4<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letter/march 9, 1976<br />\n<br />\nYoung trustee candidates give views on important issues<br />\nfrom page 3,TRUSTEES<br />\noperating budget over any great<br />\nperiod of time. In preparation for<br />\nsuch a situation, the endowment<br />\nmust be enlarged. The university<br />\nmust, by maintaining a tighter<br />\nbudget and increasing the<br />\nendowment, take a more active<br />\nrole in combatting its economic<br />\ndilemmas. 3. Maintaining<br />\ncontact with undergraduates is an<br />\nessential element of the Young<br />\ntrustee's responsibility. The<br />\nprimary function of the Young<br />\nTrustee is to represent<br />\nundergraduate opinions to a<br />\nbody whose concern is the<br />\nuniversity in its entirety.<br />\nIf! were to assume the role<br />\nof Young Trustee, I would make<br />\nmy address known to all students<br />\nand would encourage them to<br />\nkeep me ccnstantly aware of<br />\ntheir views and concerns. While<br />\nat Hopkins for scheduled Trustee<br />\nmeetings, the Youngs Trustees<br />\nshould hold informal discussions<br />\nwith groups of undergraduate<br />\nstudents. The Young Trustee<br />\nshould utilize the News-Letter<br />\nand campus mail to advise<br />\nstudents of the events ofTrustee<br />\nmeetings, with special attention<br />\nto topics Of discussion that<br />\nwould affect the Homewood<br />\nCampus directly.<br />\nFinally, I do not think that<br />\nenough interaction occurs<br />\nbetween the Board of Trustees<br />\nand currently enrolled<br />\nundergraduate students. As a<br />\nYoung Trustee, I would attempt<br />\nto encourage more meetings<br />\nbetween these two groups, in<br />\norder to further facilitate the<br />\nrepresentation of student views<br />\nto this influential board.<br />\n<br />\nMARK HYLIND 1. The<br />\neducational policy of the<br />\nUniversity seems to be leaning<br />\nmore and more'towards a liberal<br />\narts curriculum. The proposed<br />\nmerger with Peabody, as well as<br />\nthat with Goucher, seems to give<br />\nevidence of this trend. The<br />\nquestion is whether Hopkins iss<br />\nattempting to provide a more<br />\ndiverse field of study for its<br />\nstudents; or is it interested in<br />\ngrowth for growth's sake. If the<br />\nlatter is the case, the academic<br />\nexcellence of Hopkins may be in<br />\ndanger.<br />\nAlso of concern to the<br />\nstudents is the selection of<br />\nprofessors. It has become obvious<br />\nto m any of us that certain<br />\nprofessors were hired for research<br />\nrather than for their teaching<br />\nabilities. In many areas there is<br />\nnot an emphasis on teaching and<br />\nthe students are the ones who<br />\nlose out.<br />\nThe third concern of the<br />\nstudents is the lackadaisical<br />\nattitude of departments<br />\nconcerning intersession offerings.<br />\nThe number of courses has<br />\ndeclined steadily in past years to<br />\nthe detriment of the program<br />\nitself. This is a trend I feel should<br />\nbe reversed. 2. I will support a<br />\nmoderate increase of tuition, if<br />\nnecessary. However, the Board<br />\nshould not consider the student<br />\nbody as the most important<br />\nsource for needed funds, as they<br />\nseem to have in the past. In fact,<br />\nin the last four years there have<br />\nbeen two tuition increases for a<br />\n<br />\ntotal of $600. While it is true<br />\nthat tuition plays a vital role in<br />\nthe University's operating<br />\nbudget, the effect of a tuition<br />\nincrease is unimportant in relation<br />\nto the multi-million dolar<br />\nUniversity budget. For these<br />\nreasons I suggest that other<br />\nsources be tapped; perhaps a<br />\ntightening of the University's belt<br />\nis called for, 3. My future plans<br />\ninvolve my staying in Baltimore<br />\nnext year. I will maintain a direct<br />\ncontact with the undergraduate<br />\nbody and will therefore be able<br />\nto present a clear and concise<br />\npresentation of student problems<br />\nand concerns to the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br />\n<br />\nMICHELE LONGO 1. As a<br />\nYoung trustee I do not plan to<br />\nlimit myself to representing any<br />\none special interest group or<br />\ncrusade. Rather, I feel it is<br />\nimportant that a Young Trustee<br />\nhave the interests of the entire<br />\nHopkins community at heart.<br />\nMany candidates for this position<br />\nmay attempt to gather support<br />\nby playing upon currently<br />\nsensitive but overall insignificant<br />\nissues. I feel there are more<br />\nimportant issues to be<br />\ncconsidered: for example, the<br />\neffects of the ever-increasing<br />\nexpansion of the University into<br />\nand upon the Baltimore<br />\ncommunity. Another area I<br />\nwould like to become involved in<br />\nis the possibility of establishing<br />\nmanagement task forces to go<br />\ninto each branch of the<br />\nUniversity to determine whether<br />\nthe funds appropriated to each<br />\ndivision are being- used soundly<br />\nand efficiently. In doing this we<br />\nmight be able to determine<br />\nwhether or not the University<br />\nbudget may be balanced by<br />\ncutting present expenditures<br />\nrather than by raising tuition.<br />\n2. To answer this question I<br />\nwould be in favor of a sizeable<br />\nincrease in tuition resulting in a<br />\nbalanced budget if and only if<br />\nthere was a proportionate<br />\nincrease made in the financial aid<br />\navailable to students. I am also<br />\nlooking to examine the need<br />\nrequirements that determine<br />\neligibility so that middle-income<br />\nstudents can receive aid.<br />\nHopefully, the result of this<br />\nwould be that despite a sizeable<br />\ntuition increase, the net amount<br />\nthat students have to pay for<br />\ntheir college education will not<br />\nsubstantially increase. 3. In the<br />\npast, it appears to me that there<br />\nhas been little or no formalized<br />\ncontact by the Young Trustee<br />\nwith the undergraduate<br />\ncommunity. I think a policy<br />\nshould be formulated to correct<br />\nthis and there are many ways<br />\nthat this could be done. One<br />\npossibility would be to establish<br />\na committee of undergraduates<br />\nfor the purpose of being a<br />\n\"feeder\" committee to the<br />\nYoung Trustee\u2014one that would<br />\nmaintain lines of communication<br />\nbetween the Young Trustee and<br />\nthe needs of the undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nin the country for no reason,<br />\nneither are some of its history<br />\nand political science professors<br />\nthe most quoted and respected<br />\nindividuals in their fields by mere<br />\ncoincidence, nor do scholars in<br />\nthe field of literature defer to<br />\nHopkins English professors due<br />\nto some magic potion or quirk of<br />\nfate. Hopkins' departments offer<br />\nconsistently high quality and<br />\nacademic strength. Maintaining<br />\nthis high quality is not an easy<br />\ntask. In part, it can be achieved<br />\nboth by granting support and<br />\nguidance to Hopkins' outstanding<br />\nacademic\" deans and divorcing<br />\nacademics from the mechanics of<br />\nfinancing and operating a major<br />\nUniversity. If, while doing this,<br />\nthe quality' of teaching ability<br />\nand the diversity and range of<br />\ncourse offerings can be respected<br />\nand upgraded, the needs of both<br />\nthe undergraduates and the<br />\nUniversity as a whole can be met.<br />\n2. No one wants a tuition<br />\nincrease.<br />\nHaving a balanced budget has<br />\nlong distinguished Johns Hopkins<br />\nfrom the countless private<br />\ninstitutions currently on the<br />\nverge of financial disaster. The<br />\neconomic situation in the United<br />\nStates is causing massive upheaval<br />\nin every aspect of our lives. To<br />\nsay that tuition increases or<br />\ndeficit spending are out of the<br />\nquestion for Johns Hopkins in<br />\nthe near future would be<br />\nludicrous. Efforts must be made<br />\nto economize where possible in<br />\norder to yield a balanced budget.<br />\nWhere this is not possible,<br />\nHopkins must continue to play a<br />\nleadership role in the fight for<br />\nincreased federal aid to private<br />\ninstitutions of higher education.<br />\nIf and when these efforts fail, a<br />\nmoderate tuition hike with<br />\nconcomitant financial aid<br />\nincreases may be necessary. I<br />\ntrust that our federal government<br />\nwill be able to avert so critical a<br />\nfinancial situation in this country<br />\nthat both a large budget deficit<br />\nand a large tuition increase would<br />\nbe necessary. 3. Wherever I<br />\nmay be next year, a great deal of<br />\nmy thoughts will be at the<br />\nHomewood Campus of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University right here in<br />\nCharm City, U.S.A.<br />\nFour years don't disappear<br />\nthat easily.<br />\nThe ties, connections and<br />\nfriendships that I have<br />\naccumulated_ in my<br />\nundergraduate career at Johns<br />\nHopkins will surely help me to<br />\nkeep attuned to the<br />\never-changing currents of student<br />\nlife here. Where this fails, my<br />\nown conscientious efforts will<br />\nhelp me keep on top of what's<br />\nhappening at Hopkins.<br />\nNo simple formula will insure<br />\nthe maintenance of contact<br />\nbetween myself and the<br />\nundergraduates. Hopefully, the<br />\ncommitment that I have<br />\ndemonstrated over the past four<br />\nyears will be illustrative of my<br />\nability to effectively represent<br />\nthe undergraduate students as a<br />\nYoung Trustee.<br />\n<br />\nALAN FINK 1.

WEISS<br />\nWhat a tour de force! We at<br />\nHopkins are certainly honored to<br />\nhave an individual such as Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin among us. Consider, we<br />\nare in the same position as those<br />\nfortunate individuals who knew<br />\nChuck Colson or Donald Segretti<br />\nin their youth. It is sad but true:<br />\nthe extremely entertaining<br />\nanalysis written by Mr. Duvoisin<br />\nwas as full of the \"crass,'gloating<br />\nmentality\" as he alleges the<br />\nStudent Council advertisement<br />\nwas. Each of his major points are<br />\nlogically constructed half truths<br />\nor less, ignoring accuracy; it<br />\nwould seem, for a slant<br />\ncalculated to raise the public bile.<br />\nIt is true that the method<br />\ntaken by the SC to publicize<br />\nitself was of questionable taste<br />\nand open to misinterpretation<br />\ndue to oversimplification. It is<br />\nalso true that student funds had<br />\nto be spent in this effort.<br />\nHowever, some student funding<br />\nalso went toward the publication<br />\nof what amounted to a skillfully<br />\nexecuted hatchet job by Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin. It is sad that this is so,<br />\nsince, with a minimum of<br />\ninvestigative reporter<br />\nrole-playing, Mr. D. could have<br />\ndelivered an accurate critique of<br />\nwork sorely in need of one.<br />\n<br />\nThe facts of the matter are<br />\nthis: For some purpose, the SC<br />\ntook out a full page ad to<br />\ndescribe their work (not their<br />\nvictories) of the past semester or<br />\nso. This tactic is open to question<br />\non many levels, not the least is<br />\nthe brevity of the,description of<br />\nthe work. The use of one or two<br />\nwords allowed and probably<br />\ncreated a great deal of confusion.<br />\nIn this sense, Mr. D.'s heart was<br />\nprobably in the right place;<br />\nhowever, it is more difficult to<br />\nascertain where precisely his head<br />\nresided. Examining his article<br />\npoint by point, it is simple to see<br />\nwhere he went wrong. He did<br />\ninterview Dean Hall. He did not<br />\ninterview a single SC member,<br />\nany one of whom could have<br />\ncleared up Mr. D.'s unfortunate<br />\nconfusion.<br />\nAllegations<br />\nHis first allegation was that the<br />\nSC was acting out a political<br />\nmanuever, with elections in the<br />\noffing. At best this is only<br />\npartially true. The actual purpose<br />\nof the ad was to respond to the<br />\nNews-Letter's abdication of its<br />\nresponsibility to report campus<br />\nnews. For better or worse, the SC<br />\nchose this method to inform the<br />\nundergraduates, in an admittedly<br />\nsuperficial fashion, about the<br />\n<br />\nstories that the New-Letter<br />\nneglected over the past semester<br />\nand a half.<br />\nEffort number 1: \"Right off<br />\nthe bat, we have a basic<br />\ndiscrepancy,\" as Mr. D. himself<br />\nput it. He might like to know<br />\nthat 60-70 additional spaces have<br />\nbeen opened for undergraduates<br />\nin McCoy only because of the<br />\npurchase of the Baltimorean.<br />\nFurther, while the SC did not<br />\npurchase the building, their input<br />\nhad to be part of the reason the<br />\ndecision, considering the<br />\nlobbying effort undertaken by<br />\nthis year's Council over the past<br />\nsummer.<br />\nEffort number five dealt with<br />\nthe Ethics board. Once again, Mr.<br />\nD. might like to know that<br />\nmembers of this year's Council<br />\nlabored over the summer on the<br />\nCommittee that Mr. D. cited.<br />\nWithout claiming total credit, it<br />\nis entirely fair for the Council to<br />\ncite this as a part of their work.<br />\nRegarding effort number four,<br />\nmembers of the SC researched<br />\nthe tuition question for over<br />\nthree weeks, meeting with all<br />\nrelevant administrators, including<br />\nPres. Muller. The conclusion<br />\nreached was that a price like was<br />\n<br />\ninevitable, and some effort was<br />\nmade to hold that incraease as<br />\nlow as possible. While it's no<br />\nglorious victory, it was certainly<br />\nworth note.<br />\nOn the face of it, Mr. D. seems<br />\nto have a good point about effort<br />\nnumber fourteen, the academic<br />\nreports. However, one question<br />\ncould ahve cleared up the<br />\nconfusion. The listing cited this<br />\nyear's efforts, including the<br />\ncreation of one SC committee<br />\nwith full responsibility for the<br />\nreports and one SC\u2014Academic<br />\nCouncil committee with<br />\nresponsibility for implementation<br />\nof the major suggestions.<br />\nMr. D.'s attack on effort<br />\nthirteen was really a low blow.<br />\nWhen the original course listings<br />\nwere released for this past<br />\nintersession, members of this<br />\nyear's SC, appalled at the low<br />\nnumber, visited professors<br />\nindividually. They were directly<br />\nresponsible for nine additional<br />\ncourses given over this past<br />\nintersession. This certainly is to<br />\ntheir credit.<br />\nTurning finally to the area of<br />\nFlying Monkey, lectureships,<br />\netc., I respond to Mr. D's analogy<br />\nwith one of my own. Do you<br />\n<br />\nreally believe that Pres. Muller<br />\nwrites his budget by himself?<br />\nEach of the areas mentioned in<br />\nthe ad are under the aegis of the<br />\nSC. The SC selects each of the<br />\nchairpeople, and the SC is<br />\ndirectly responsible for their<br />\nefforts. They get the flack if<br />\nthere is a failure and deserve the<br />\ncredit for a success. Consider Mr.<br />\nD.: you aren't on the masthead,<br />\nbut you are part of the<br />\nNews-Letter. Similarly, Flying<br />\nMonkey is a SC subcommittee of<br />\nthe SC Social Committee.<br />\nEven beyond the continual<br />\nmisrepresentations of Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin's article, the basic<br />\ntragedy is that he misses the<br />\npoint. The SC wasn't piesenting a<br />\n\"portfolio.\" That would have<br />\nrequired far too much space.<br />\nWhat they were tyring to do was<br />\nrender the Council visible for the<br />\nfirst time since early this year.<br />\nThe details that they sacrificed<br />\nshould have been found in<br />\narticles in past issues of the<br />\nNews-Letter, rather than in a<br />\nsingle SC ad. What the SC would<br />\nlike is a sign that the<br />\nNews-Letter is functional as well<br />\nas aesthetic.

Clearly, this means the<br />\nexceptional and not the average<br />\ngraduate student; but I feel that<br />\nevery department has at least one<br />\nor two such highly motivated and<br />\nwell informed students. (In the<br />\npast I've tried to stake a lunch<br />\nfor the few promising applicants<br />\nwho reach us with two graduate<br />\nstudents whom I consider our<br />\nbest agents.) To make such a<br />\nprogram work, especially if it<br />\nmeant off-campus recruiting,<br />\nmight well mean some small<br />\nstipend (possibly under WorkStudy support).

We should try to<br />\nreflect the peculiarities as well as<br />\nthe pride of the place in our<br />\nliterature. There are few pages of<br />\nany catalogue upon which time<br />\nwill not cast a tinge of the<br />\nabsurd, so this means the burden<br />\nof constant revision.

We need to know<br />\nourselves better (a charge that<br />\nOedipus found as hard as Freud<br />\nto bear). We. need to<br />\ncommunicate the possibilities for<br />\nexcitement as well as hard work<br />\nwith greater effectiveness. We<br />\nneed to question whether some<br />\nof our goals haven't been lost in<br />\nthe shuffle. Despite indivdival<br />\ncommitments, the term<br />\n\"minority recruitment\" is not<br />\none that I hear much lately. And<br />\nwhere it is possible, we need to<br />\nshare some of our common<br />\nburdens. A joint conference on<br />\nadmissions might be a step<br />\ntoward this objective.<br />\nIn the past three or four 'years<br />\nI'm convinced that we have made<br />\nsome extraordinary advances in a<br />\nnumber of fields toward our<br />\nperennial goals. It's not a bad<br />\nseason to remember the people<br />\nwho have made this possbile. Yet<br />\nfaculty and new programs are<br />\nultimatedly only as effective at<br />\nthe undergraduate level as the<br />\nstudents who use them. Unless<br />\nwe can attract sharper, more<br />\nengaged undergraduates in<br />\ncertain fields - people who can<br />\ngalvanize the rest - I foresee the<br />\nground we have won in terms of<br />\nfaculty., involvement in<br />\nundergraduate teaching eroding<br />\nand many colleaglies pulling back<br />\ninto the more familiar graduate<br />\nand research postures. Our hope<br />\nfor Hopkins has always been not<br />\njust the coexistence of these<br />\nthree elements but their creative<br />\ninteraction. Most of us are<br />\nwilling to give up the alleged<br />\nadvantages of bigness and<br />\ndelegated responsibility in the<br />\nhope that this interaction can be<br />\nbetter achieved. For certain<br />\nstudents in certain fields I'm<br />\nconvinced that this may be the<br />\nbest place in the country (which<br />\nis not to say ideal!), but if the<br />\nnews is a closely held secret<br />\nreacing no one outside the walls,<br />\nwe might as well go back to our<br />\ncells.<br />\nDr. Richard<br />\nMacksey is Director of the<br />\nHumanities Center.<br />\n<br />\nit hurts us too<br />\n<br />\nUse by Barnstormers hurts listening and viewing room<br />\nBy BOBBY RIGGS<br />\nLighting and sound<br />\nmalfunctions, and damage to<br />\nelectrical circuitry in the<br />\nListening-Viewing Room has<br />\nresulted from the adaptation of<br />\nthe facility for use by the<br />\nBarnstormers, according to<br />\nDirector of Student Activities<br />\nChris Columbo.<br />\nDifficulties<br />\nMost of the difficulties<br />\ninvolved the lighting and sound<br />\nsystems of the L-V room.<br />\nColumbo said that at times the<br />\nmain speakers did not work<br />\nproperly.

I'm sorry.\"<br />\nA fter repeated demands of<br />\n\"Why don't you write a letter of<br />\nprotest to Iran?\", he finally<br />\ncountered, \"I just might do<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nIn response to demands to<br />\ndrop charges against the<br />\nprotestors, Muller reiterated his<br />\nstand: \"The University does not<br />\npress charges. The arrests were<br />\nmade and then it becomes a<br />\nmatter for the States Attorney.\"<br />\nWhen urged to use his personal<br />\ninfluence and the University's<br />\nprestige in the matter, he<br />\nanswered, \"If the charges were<br />\nwithdrawn, and they (members<br />\nof the security force) were<br />\nexposed to suits, I think that<br />\nwould be an irresponsible act. In<br /><br />\nany case, whatever I do or don't<br />\ndo in this case, I would certainly<br />\nnever say anything public (about<br />\nthe action).\"<br />\nHe refused to directly<br />\nacknowledge error in the matter,<br />\nbut did take full responsibility<br />\nfor the decision: \". . . there's<br />\nonly one person to blame, and<br />\nthat's me. It was never forced on<br />\nthe University. . . There was a<br />\nmistake in judgement on my part<br />\nthat people would distinguish<br />\nbetween her (Princess Ashraf)<br />\nand the government.\"<br />\nMuller cited two reasons for<br />\nselecting Ashraf as the recipient<br />\nof the honorary degree.<br />\n'We wanted some<br />\nacknowledgement of Hopkins'<br />\nmedical tradition. . . The Iranian<br />\nprogram is the largest<br />\ninternational activity we are<br />\ninvolved in . . .\" Ashraf was<br />\nchosen because of her position as<br />\ntitular head of the Pahlavi<br />\nMedical Center in Tehran.<br />\n\". . .plus the fact that she's a<br />\nwoman--she was active in the<br />\nInternational Women's Year. She<br />\nhas been a leading figure in<br />\nstarting up and funding the<br />\nadvocacy of women's rights.\"<br />\nMuller was repeatedly attacked<br />\nfor the entire process of awarding<br />\nhonorary degrees. \"Why wasn't a<br />\nthorough investigation run on her<br />\nbackground,\" asked one student.<br />\nHe explained that \"these<br />\nhonorary degrees are largely<br />\nsymbolic. We don't run checks<br />\nnormally. . . There are no stated<br />\ncriteria (for the honorary<br />\ndegrees). It may well be that as a<br />\nresult of this, the faculty may<br />\ndevelop some.\"<br />\n\"It may be just as well that we<br />\ncannot award degrees to public<br />\nfigures. I'm going to be much<br />\nmore cautious about public<br />\nfigures of any kind.\"<br />\nMuller denied as \"simply<br />\nuntrue,\" all allegations of<br />\nmonetary reward from Iran.\"We<br /><br />\nhaven't received gifts from Iran,<br />\nand we don't expect to receive<br />\nmoney from Iran.\"<br />\n\"If my action in awarding the<br />\nhonorary degree insulted any<br />\npeople in the university<br />\ncommunity, I apologize. On<br />\ndropping charges, I have already<br />\nsaid that I will not say anything<br />\npublicly.\"<br />\n\"I don't mind being accused of<br />\nmaking a mistake--but I have not<br />\nlied, and I don't intend to.

What are the three most<br />\nimportant student concerns you<br />\nWould hope to confront, in the<br />\narea of educational policy, as a<br />\nYoung Trustee?<br />\n2. Describe your philosophy of<br />\ntuition increase. Which would<br />\nYou favor: (a) a rrioderate<br />\nincrease resulting in an operating<br />\nbudget deficit; or (b) a sizeable<br />\nincrease resulting in a balanced<br />\nbudget?<br />\n3. In what ways do you intend<br />\nto maintain contact with the<br />\nundergraduate student body,<br />\nafter you graduate, to serve in<br />\nthe capacity of a Young Trustee?<br />\nDON STRADER 1. The three<br />\nmost pressing student concerns I<br />\nwould hope to confront in the<br />\narea of educational policy as a<br />\nYoung trustee are<br />\ncommunication, the offering of<br />\nsufficient courses that students<br />\nrequire and are interested in, and<br />\nthe library. As I said in my<br />\nstatement of candidacy, I feel<br />\n\"there is a definite need for<br />\nresponsive action on student<br />\ninput to the decision-making<br />\nProcess.\" At the present time<br />\nthere are various shortages in<br />\ncourse offerings in some areas. As<br />\na young trustee I would seek to<br />\nidentify these shortages and try<br />\nto find ways to rectify them.<br />\nDuring Intersession the<br />\nShortage of courses in general<br />\nresulted in crowded classes and<br />\nstudents who could not find a<br />\ncourse to take without a lot of<br />\nsearching because many were<br />\n\"full\". In addition students<br />\ntaking courses that had large<br />\nnumber of participants and a<br />\nlarge volume of reserve reading<br />\nfound that the readings were<br />\nimpossible to obtain as the<br />\nreserve room was closed about as<br />\nmuch as it was open during<br />\n1 ntersession. Thus, even when<br />\ncourses are offered they do not<br />\nalways receive adequate support<br />\nby the university. To continue<br />\nwith what I mentioned as the<br />\nthird \"pressing problem\", the<br />\nlibrary has a problem with the<br />\novercrowding of books and<br />\nPeople. Perhaps the library's lack<br />\nof _space with a lack of money<br />\nhas resulted in the library's poor<br />\nacquisition program lately. Some<br />\nstudents I have talked to lately<br />\nsay they can no longer find<br />\nadequate material for their<br />\nresearch in what the JHU<br />\nCircular calls \"the major<br />\nresearch, teaching, and cultural<br />\nresources of the University . . .<br />\n(and) one of the major research<br />\nlibraries of the country. 2. On<br />\nrelation to question 2, I pick<br />\nanswer (a), but hope that<br />\nmoderate increases in \u2022tuition<br />\nalong with much study of fiscal<br />\nproblems and solutions can result<br />\nin a balanced budget. 3. It is<br />\ndifficult to determine which are<br />\nthe best ways, \"to maintain<br />\ncontact with the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body, after you<br />\ngraduate,\" in advance without a<br />\ntrial period. However at the<br />\npresent time I plan attending<br />\nstudent functions and intend to<br />\nsolicit suggestions from students<br />\nas well as others.,<br /><br />\nED BROKANS 1. Hopkins<br />\nshould expand and diversify as<br />\nthe opportunities arise. I support<br />\nand will work for the<br />\nestablishment of a Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Law, and School for<br />\nthe Arts. The implementation of<br />\nsuch policies will lead to a more<br />\ndiverse student body and an<br />\nenriched intellectual<br />\nenvironment, thus attracting<br />\nscholars who are less science<br />\noriented. It will enhance<br />\nHopkins' prestige and further our<br />\ntradition as the first true<br />\nuniversity. We must fully explore'<br />\nthe advantages of affiliation with<br />\nthe Peabody Institute, and act to<br />\nrealize Dr. Eisenhower's goal of a<br />\nSchool of Law. Such positive<br />\nsteps are the main responsilbility<br />\nof the Young Trustees in the area<br />\nof educational policy. Other<br />\nacademic concerns (i.e.,<br />\nplus-minus grading, pass-fail<br />\noption) are matters to be<br />\nconfronted by the student<br />\nrepresentatives of the CUS and<br />\nAcademic Council. The Board of<br />\nTrustees formulates educational<br />\npolicy, while these committees<br />\nare charged with its<br />\nimplementation. 2. 'Moderate<br />\nincrease' or 'sizeable increase' is a<br />\nmatter of semantics: any increase<br />\nis sure to have an adverse impact<br />\non some students. Wheras a $100<br />\nhike . might seem moderate to<br />\nsome, it would be devastating to<br />\nothers. The critical choice,<br />\ntherefore, is between an<br />\noperating deficit and a balanced<br />\nbudget. Sound fiscal policy<br />\nmandates the latter. Deficits<br />\nprovide only temporary relief,<br />\nbut lead to long-term disaster.<br />\nEndowments will drop,<br />\nfund-raising will become<br />\ndifficult, and the consequences<br />\nwill be severe. A balanced budget<br />\nmeans Hopkins will survive. I am<br />\nnot convinced, however, that<br />\ntuition increases are required for<br />\na balanced budget. Instead,<br />\nnon-essential portions of the<br />\nbudget, particularly those in<br />\nadministration, should be cut<br />\nfirst. Only as an absolute last<br />\nresort will I consider voting for<br />\nany tuition increase. And then, I<br />\nwill have to be assured of a<br />\nconcomitant increase in financial<br />\naid. 3. During my 4-year term<br />\nas Young Trustee, I plan to stay<br />\nin and around the<br />\nWashington area. My philosophy:<br />\nthe closer to -lopldns\u2014the better.<br />\nFrequent trips to Homewood will<br />\nallow personal communication<br />\nwith the \u2018students, faculty and<br />\nemployees I have rfiet during my<br />\nfour years here. I feel a Young<br />\nTrustee must remain in close<br />\ncontact with Hopkins'- students<br />\n(more than 3 or 4 visits a year),<br />\nand be ever diligent so as not to<br />\ndrift away from his<br />\nresponsibilities. In addition, I will<br />\naccept correspondence from all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who wish to discuss<br />\nany problems. I will be a visible<br />\nYoung Trustee.<br /><br />\nAPRIL MORENO 1. Two<br />\nacademic areas of personal<br />\nconcern are the fine arts and<br />\nfundamental biology. Firstly, I<br />\npropose an integrated<br />\ncurriculum, using existing<br />\ndepartments as building blocks.<br />\nStudio art, for example, could be<br /><br />\noffered through the History of<br />\nArt department and would<br />\nbenefit persons interested in the<br />\nhistory of art, architecture,<br />\narcheology, and any scientific<br />\nillustration. Secondly, since<br />\nmany science majors feel<br />\nsaturated with the molecular<br />\naspects of the cell, but are<br />\ninsecure about botanical or<br />\nzoological facts, a team of<br />\npresent professors (or one new<br />\nprofessor if that were financially<br />\nfeasible) would offer a<br />\nmacrobiology course, geared to,<br />\nbut not specifically for, science<br />\nmajors. My third concern is a<br />\nbroad one. I feel it is up to the<br />\nBoard of Trustees to insure the<br />\ncredibility of these new courses<br />\nand insure their academic merit,<br />\nas well as that of the disciplines<br />\nalready present at Hopkins.<br />\n2. Although a balanced budget<br />\nis the thing that makes the world<br />\ngo around, I oppose an<br />\nimmediate tuition increase. I<br />\nfavor a three year deficit plan.<br />\nThe exact deficit must be<br />\nmonitored and partially<br />\nalleviated by stringent budget<br />\nmanagement among university<br />\ndepartments; I feel the University<br />\ncould survive slightly in the red<br />\nfor several years if the deficit did<br />\nnot escalate rapidly. If the debt<br />\nbecame insurmountable, then a<br />\ngradual tuition increase would be<br />\nnecessary, but should not be<br />\nlevied on the students without<br />\nconsideration and careful<br />\nexplanation. I do not support<br />\nannual increases, for any reason.<br />\n3. I will be living in Baltimore<br />\nfor the next two years, writing<br />\nfor one of the city newspapers.<br />\nAnyone who wants to contact<br />\nme can do so by phone or by<br />\nmail. I plan to have weekly office<br />\nhours three times monthly in<br />\nLevering and once monthly in<br />\nthe dorms, room space<br />\npermitting. I will inform all<br />\nundergrads of the times and<br />\nplaces of these hours via the<br />\ncampus mail. In addition, I will<br />\nkeep them advised on the<br />\ndecisions of the Board of<br />\nTrustees that affect<br />\nundergraduates.<br /><br />\nDAN HOLIK 1. The Johns<br />\nHopkins University has shown.<br />\nthat it can expand its curriculum<br />\nand m aintain high standards;<br />\nwitness the recent creation of the<br />\nAnthropology Department, the<br />\nHumanities and Biology Honors<br />\nPrograms, and the Bologna Year<br />\nAbroad and Public Health<br />\noptions. As a Young Trustee, I<br />\nwill continue to press for<br />\nenlargements of academic areas<br />\nof study at Homewood. The<br />\nentire community would benefit<br />\nfrom new programs in studio art<br />\nand music performance, Oriental<br />\nlanguages, Russian and Asian<br />\nstudies, film, dance and drama.<br />\nHopkins was in the vanguard of<br />\ngraduate schools in the United<br />\nStates, it must strive to remain in<br />\nthe forefronit of college<br />\neducation by always seeking new<br />\nintellectual approaches to<br />\nexplore.<br />\nAn academic expansion of the<br />\nuniversity will require that<br />\nadditional resources for study are<br />\navailable to the student body.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees must<br />\nsolicit funds for the continual<br /><br />\nupgrading of the physical plant<br />\nand facilities. As a Young<br />\nTrustee, I will seek funds to<br />\nenlarge the library and art<br />\n-collections of the university,<br />\nadditional lecture series,<br />\nconcerts, practice rooms and<br />\nstudent publications. I urge all<br />\nmembers of the student body to<br />\napproach the Board with requests<br />\nfor aid of this nature.<br />\nFinally, the Board of Trustees<br />\nmust seek to maintain the<br />\ninherent advantages of the size of<br />\nthe university. Independent<br />\nstudy and research, practicums,<br />\nfellowship programs, and the<br />\nin tersession offer students an<br />\nopportunity to work and relate<br />\nto others as people instead of<br />\ngraded commodities. The Board<br />\nof Trustees must set and<br />\nmaintain Hopkins' emphasis on<br />\nthe individual student. I am sure<br />\nthat most if not all students are<br />\naware that many of the<br />\nuniversity's courses and<br />\nopportunities exist in the<br />\ncatalogue but not on the campus.<br />\nAs a Young Trustee, I will try to<br />\nidentify those situations and<br />\naffect needed reforms.<br />\n2. Increases in tuition should<br />\nnot and must not be set<br />\naccording to the balance of the<br />\nHomewood Campus budget. The<br />\ntuition students now pay per<br />\nsemester covers less than half of<br />\nthe operating expenses incurred<br />\nat the Homewood campus.<br />\nIncremental increases in tuition<br />\n(for example $200 every 2 years)<br />\nwill not match the logrithmic<br />\nincreases in operating costs of the<br />\nuniversity. Since the Board of<br />\nTrustees is responsible for the<br />\nsolvency of the institution, the<br />\nYoung Trustees must be willing<br />\nto investigate any and all outside<br />\nsources of income for Hopkins in<br />\norder to defray or reduce tuition<br />\nincreases for undergraduates.<br />\n3. I intend to maintain contact<br />\nwith the undergraduate body by<br />\nall possible methods\u2014frequent<br />\nvisits, meetings with students and<br />\nstudent groups(invitations gladly<br />\naccepted), correspondence (write<br />\nme a letter, I hate to see my<br />\nempty mailbox), and reading<br />\n(each Trustee should be given a<br />\nlifetime subscription to the<br />\nNews-Letter).<br />\nI hope that the student body<br />\nwill make this task easier by<br />\ncontinuing to vigorously and<br />\nvocally press for the<br />\nimprovement of student services<br />\nat Homewood. The Board should<br />\nbe a focus point in this effort. To<br />\nthis end, I propose that the<br />\nBoard hold sessions specifically<br />\ndesigned to air student grievances<br />\nand suggestions. I am sure that<br />\nthe Trustees and the<br />\nundergraduates will gain valuable<br />\ninsight and perception\u2014to be<br />\nused for the benefit of all<br />\nconcerned.<br /><br />\nLEAH SEIDENFELD 1. From<br />\nthe literature, describing the<br />\nBoard of Trustees I have received<br />\nduring my candidacy, I have<br />\nlearned that unfortunately, the<br />\nBoard has little to do with<br />\neducational policy. This has been<br />\nan area where I have<br />\nconcentrated a considerable<br />\namount of energy during my<br />\nyears at Hopkins. I feel that<br />\neducational policy is one of the<br /><br />\nmost important realms of the<br />\nUniversity, in which<br />\nundergraduates can express their<br />\nviews. For this reason, I will<br />\nattempt, if chosen as Young<br />\nTrustee, to confront areas of<br />\nstudent concern in educaitonal<br />\npolicy in whatever manner<br />\npossible.<br />\nI see the research vs. teaching<br />\ndilemma in faculty orientation as<br />\none of the most pressing<br />\nproblems facing students here.<br />\nWhile the importance of research<br />\nis easily recognized, teaching<br />\nshould also be emphasized. It is<br />\nspecifically of concern to<br />\nundergraduates. The position of<br />\nthe University on this issue is<br />\ndecidedly slanted towards<br />\nresearch. A more common<br />\nground between these two<br />\npositions should be<br />\nattained. The departments, and<br />\nthe majors and courses they<br />\noffer, are in need of scrutiny.<br />\nThe needs of undergraduates<br />\nshould be constantly<br />\nre-evaluated, as should the<br />\neffectiveness of the departments<br />\nand their offerings to meet these<br />\nneeds.<br />\nFinally, I think that there is a<br />\ngrowing desire among the student<br />\nbody for accelerated BAMA type<br />\nprograms. This type of advanced<br />\ncourse offering should be<br />\nemphasized and the number of<br />\ndepartments offering the BA-MA<br />\ndegree increased.<br />\nThe needs and interests of the<br />\nHopkins underg,raduate student<br />\nbody should take a high priority<br />\nin academic policy<br />\nconsiderations. While I would not<br />\nbe directly involved with<br />\nscholastic concerns as a Young<br />\nTrustee, I would endeavor to<br />\nrepresent student concerns in the<br />\narea of academic policy, to the<br />\nbest of my ability. 2. It is my<br />\nopinion that many times the<br />\nHopkins undergraduate students<br />\nare forced to bear the brunt of an<br />\noverly generous budgeting<br />\nprocess, through tuition<br />\nincreases. I feel that the<br />\npossibility exists for substantial<br />\nbudgetary cuts in various sectors<br />\nof the University. Such cuts<br />\nwould eliminate or minimize<br />\ntuition increases.<br />\nThe endowment of the Arts &amp;<br />\nSciences Division is very small.<br />\nSizeable deficits over a sustained<br />\nperiod could not be absorbed by<br />\nthis endowment. Substantial<br />\nfund-raising effotts should be<br />\nundertaken to increase the<br />\nendowment. If, because of the<br />\neconomic climate of the country,<br />\ncosts rise, the endowment should<br />\nbe able to absorbthe resultant<br />\ndeficient to some extent. The<br />\nstudents should not always be<br />\nheld responsible for making up<br />\nthe losses incurred. The<br />\nendowments of other Hopkins<br />\ndivisions are considerably higher<br />\nthan that of the Arts &amp; Sciences<br />\nDivision. Efforts should be made<br />\nto increase the funds received by<br />\nthis sector of the University.<br />\nI would favor a moderate<br />\nincrease in tuition resulting in an<br />\noperating budget deficit, over a<br />\nsizeable tuition increase resulting<br />\nin a balanced budget, if an<br />\nincrease was absolutely<br />\nnecessary. However, the<br />\ncurrent state of the endowment<br />\ncould not sustain a deficit in the<br /><br />\nsee TRUSTEES, page 4<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/march 9, 1976<br /><br />\nYoung trustee candidates give views on important issues<br />\nfrom page 3,TRUSTEES<br />\noperating budget over any great<br />\nperiod of time. In preparation for<br />\nsuch a situation, the endowment<br />\nmust be enlarged. The university<br />\nmust, by maintaining a tighter<br />\nbudget and increasing the<br />\nendowment, take a more active<br />\nrole in combatting its economic<br />\ndilemmas. 3. Maintaining<br />\ncontact with undergraduates is an<br />\nessential element of the Young<br />\ntrustee's responsibility. The<br />\nprimary function of the Young<br />\nTrustee is to represent<br />\nundergraduate opinions to a<br />\nbody whose concern is the<br />\nuniversity in its entirety.<br />\nIf! were to assume the role<br />\nof Young Trustee, I would make<br />\nmy address known to all students<br />\nand would encourage them to<br />\nkeep me ccnstantly aware of<br />\ntheir views and concerns. While<br />\nat Hopkins for scheduled Trustee<br />\nmeetings, the Youngs Trustees<br />\nshould hold informal discussions<br />\nwith groups of undergraduate<br />\nstudents. The Young Trustee<br />\nshould utilize the News-Letter<br />\nand campus mail to advise<br />\nstudents of the events ofTrustee<br />\nmeetings, with special attention<br />\nto topics Of discussion that<br />\nwould affect the Homewood<br />\nCampus directly.<br />\nFinally, I do not think that<br />\nenough interaction occurs<br />\nbetween the Board of Trustees<br />\nand currently enrolled<br />\nundergraduate students. As a<br />\nYoung Trustee, I would attempt<br />\nto encourage more meetings<br />\nbetween these two groups, in<br />\norder to further facilitate the<br />\nrepresentation of student views<br />\nto this influential board.<br /><br />\nMARK HYLIND 1. The<br />\neducational policy of the<br />\nUniversity seems to be leaning<br />\nmore and more'towards a liberal<br />\narts curriculum. The proposed<br />\nmerger with Peabody, as well as<br />\nthat with Goucher, seems to give<br />\nevidence of this trend. The<br />\nquestion is whether Hopkins iss<br />\nattempting to provide a more<br />\ndiverse field of study for its<br />\nstudents; or is it interested in<br />\ngrowth for growth's sake. If the<br />\nlatter is the case, the academic<br />\nexcellence of Hopkins may be in<br />\ndanger.<br />\nAlso of concern to the<br />\nstudents is the selection of<br />\nprofessors. It has become obvious<br />\nto m any of us that certain<br />\nprofessors were hired for research<br />\nrather than for their teaching<br />\nabilities. In many areas there is<br />\nnot an emphasis on teaching and<br />\nthe students are the ones who<br />\nlose out.<br />\nThe third concern of the<br />\nstudents is the lackadaisical<br />\nattitude of departments<br />\nconcerning intersession offerings.<br />\nThe number of courses has<br />\ndeclined steadily in past years to<br />\nthe detriment of the program<br />\nitself. This is a trend I feel should<br />\nbe reversed. 2. I will support a<br />\nmoderate increase of tuition, if<br />\nnecessary. However, the Board<br />\nshould not consider the student<br />\nbody as the most important<br />\nsource for needed funds, as they<br />\nseem to have in the past. In fact,<br />\nin the last four years there have<br />\nbeen two tuition increases for a<br /><br />\ntotal of $600. While it is true<br />\nthat tuition plays a vital role in<br />\nthe University's operating<br />\nbudget, the effect of a tuition<br />\nincrease is unimportant in relation<br />\nto the multi-million dolar<br />\nUniversity budget. For these<br />\nreasons I suggest that other<br />\nsources be tapped; perhaps a<br />\ntightening of the University's belt<br />\nis called for, 3. My future plans<br />\ninvolve my staying in Baltimore<br />\nnext year. I will maintain a direct<br />\ncontact with the undergraduate<br />\nbody and will therefore be able<br />\nto present a clear and concise<br />\npresentation of student problems<br />\nand concerns to the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br /><br />\nMICHELE LONGO 1. As a<br />\nYoung trustee I do not plan to<br />\nlimit myself to representing any<br />\none special interest group or<br />\ncrusade. Rather, I feel it is<br />\nimportant that a Young Trustee<br />\nhave the interests of the entire<br />\nHopkins community at heart.<br />\nMany candidates for this position<br />\nmay attempt to gather support<br />\nby playing upon currently<br />\nsensitive but overall insignificant<br />\nissues. I feel there are more<br />\nimportant issues to be<br />\ncconsidered: for example, the<br />\neffects of the ever-increasing<br />\nexpansion of the University into<br />\nand upon the Baltimore<br />\ncommunity. Another area I<br />\nwould like to become involved in<br />\nis the possibility of establishing<br />\nmanagement task forces to go<br />\ninto each branch of the<br />\nUniversity to determine whether<br />\nthe funds appropriated to each<br />\ndivision are being- used soundly<br />\nand efficiently. In doing this we<br />\nmight be able to determine<br />\nwhether or not the University<br />\nbudget may be balanced by<br />\ncutting present expenditures<br />\nrather than by raising tuition.<br />\n2. To answer this question I<br />\nwould be in favor of a sizeable<br />\nincrease in tuition resulting in a<br />\nbalanced budget if and only if<br />\nthere was a proportionate<br />\nincrease made in the financial aid<br />\navailable to students. I am also<br />\nlooking to examine the need<br />\nrequirements that determine<br />\neligibility so that middle-income<br />\nstudents can receive aid.<br />\nHopefully, the result of this<br />\nwould be that despite a sizeable<br />\ntuition increase, the net amount<br />\nthat students have to pay for<br />\ntheir college education will not<br />\nsubstantially increase. 3. In the<br />\npast, it appears to me that there<br />\nhas been little or no formalized<br />\ncontact by the Young Trustee<br />\nwith the undergraduate<br />\ncommunity. I think a policy<br />\nshould be formulated to correct<br />\nthis and there are many ways<br />\nthat this could be done. One<br />\npossibility would be to establish<br />\na committee of undergraduates<br />\nfor the purpose of being a<br />\n\"feeder\" committee to the<br />\nYoung Trustee\u2014one that would<br />\nmaintain lines of communication<br />\nbetween the Young Trustee and<br />\nthe needs of the undergraduates.<br /><br />\nin the country for no reason,<br />\nneither are some of its history<br />\nand political science professors<br />\nthe most quoted and respected<br />\nindividuals in their fields by mere<br />\ncoincidence, nor do scholars in<br />\nthe field of literature defer to<br />\nHopkins English professors due<br />\nto some magic potion or quirk of<br />\nfate. Hopkins' departments offer<br />\nconsistently high quality and<br />\nacademic strength. Maintaining<br />\nthis high quality is not an easy<br />\ntask. In part, it can be achieved<br />\nboth by granting support and<br />\nguidance to Hopkins' outstanding<br />\nacademic\" deans and divorcing<br />\nacademics from the mechanics of<br />\nfinancing and operating a major<br />\nUniversity. If, while doing this,<br />\nthe quality' of teaching ability<br />\nand the diversity and range of<br />\ncourse offerings can be respected<br />\nand upgraded, the needs of both<br />\nthe undergraduates and the<br />\nUniversity as a whole can be met.<br />\n2. No one wants a tuition<br />\nincrease.<br />\nHaving a balanced budget has<br />\nlong distinguished Johns Hopkins<br />\nfrom the countless private<br />\ninstitutions currently on the<br />\nverge of financial disaster. The<br />\neconomic situation in the United<br />\nStates is causing massive upheaval<br />\nin every aspect of our lives. To<br />\nsay that tuition increases or<br />\ndeficit spending are out of the<br />\nquestion for Johns Hopkins in<br />\nthe near future would be<br />\nludicrous. Efforts must be made<br />\nto economize where possible in<br />\norder to yield a balanced budget.<br />\nWhere this is not possible,<br />\nHopkins must continue to play a<br />\nleadership role in the fight for<br />\nincreased federal aid to private<br />\ninstitutions of higher education.<br />\nIf and when these efforts fail, a<br />\nmoderate tuition hike with<br />\nconcomitant financial aid<br />\nincreases may be necessary. I<br />\ntrust that our federal government<br />\nwill be able to avert so critical a<br />\nfinancial situation in this country<br />\nthat both a large budget deficit<br />\nand a large tuition increase would<br />\nbe necessary. 3. Wherever I<br />\nmay be next year, a great deal of<br />\nmy thoughts will be at the<br />\nHomewood Campus of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University right here in<br />\nCharm City, U.S.A.<br />\nFour years don't disappear<br />\nthat easily.<br />\nThe ties, connections and<br />\nfriendships that I have<br />\naccumulated_ in my<br />\nundergraduate career at Johns<br />\nHopkins will surely help me to<br />\nkeep attuned to the<br />\never-changing currents of student<br />\nlife here. Where this fails, my<br />\nown conscientious efforts will<br />\nhelp me keep on top of what's<br />\nhappening at Hopkins.<br />\nNo simple formula will insure<br />\nthe maintenance of contact<br />\nbetween myself and the<br />\nundergraduates. Hopefully, the<br />\ncommitment that I have<br />\ndemonstrated over the past four<br />\nyears will be illustrative of my<br />\nability to effectively represent<br />\nthe undergraduate students as a<br />\nYoung Trustee.<br /><br />\nALAN FINK 1.

WEISS<br />\nWhat a tour de force! We at<br />\nHopkins are certainly honored to<br />\nhave an individual such as Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin among us. Consider, we<br />\nare in the same position as those<br />\nfortunate individuals who knew<br />\nChuck Colson or Donald Segretti<br />\nin their youth. It is sad but true:<br />\nthe extremely entertaining<br />\nanalysis written by Mr. Duvoisin<br />\nwas as full of the \"crass,'gloating<br />\nmentality\" as he alleges the<br />\nStudent Council advertisement<br />\nwas. Each of his major points are<br />\nlogically constructed half truths<br />\nor less, ignoring accuracy; it<br />\nwould seem, for a slant<br />\ncalculated to raise the public bile.<br />\nIt is true that the method<br />\ntaken by the SC to publicize<br />\nitself was of questionable taste<br />\nand open to misinterpretation<br />\ndue to oversimplification. It is<br />\nalso true that student funds had<br />\nto be spent in this effort.<br />\nHowever, some student funding<br />\nalso went toward the publication<br />\nof what amounted to a skillfully<br />\nexecuted hatchet job by Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin. It is sad that this is so,<br />\nsince, with a minimum of<br />\ninvestigative reporter<br />\nrole-playing, Mr. D. could have<br />\ndelivered an accurate critique of<br />\nwork sorely in need of one.<br /><br />\nThe facts of the matter are<br />\nthis: For some purpose, the SC<br />\ntook out a full page ad to<br />\ndescribe their work (not their<br />\nvictories) of the past semester or<br />\nso. This tactic is open to question<br />\non many levels, not the least is<br />\nthe brevity of the,description of<br />\nthe work. The use of one or two<br />\nwords allowed and probably<br />\ncreated a great deal of confusion.<br />\nIn this sense, Mr. D.'s heart was<br />\nprobably in the right place;<br />\nhowever, it is more difficult to<br />\nascertain where precisely his head<br />\nresided. Examining his article<br />\npoint by point, it is simple to see<br />\nwhere he went wrong. He did<br />\ninterview Dean Hall. He did not<br />\ninterview a single SC member,<br />\nany one of whom could have<br />\ncleared up Mr. D.'s unfortunate<br />\nconfusion.<br />\nAllegations<br />\nHis first allegation was that the<br />\nSC was acting out a political<br />\nmanuever, with elections in the<br />\noffing. At best this is only<br />\npartially true. The actual purpose<br />\nof the ad was to respond to the<br />\nNews-Letter's abdication of its<br />\nresponsibility to report campus<br />\nnews. For better or worse, the SC<br />\nchose this method to inform the<br />\nundergraduates, in an admittedly<br />\nsuperficial fashion, about the<br /><br />\nstories that the New-Letter<br />\nneglected over the past semester<br />\nand a half.<br />\nEffort number 1: \"Right off<br />\nthe bat, we have a basic<br />\ndiscrepancy,\" as Mr. D. himself<br />\nput it. He might like to know<br />\nthat 60-70 additional spaces have<br />\nbeen opened for undergraduates<br />\nin McCoy only because of the<br />\npurchase of the Baltimorean.<br />\nFurther, while the SC did not<br />\npurchase the building, their input<br />\nhad to be part of the reason the<br />\ndecision, considering the<br />\nlobbying effort undertaken by<br />\nthis year's Council over the past<br />\nsummer.<br />\nEffort number five dealt with<br />\nthe Ethics board. Once again, Mr.<br />\nD. might like to know that<br />\nmembers of this year's Council<br />\nlabored over the summer on the<br />\nCommittee that Mr. D. cited.<br />\nWithout claiming total credit, it<br />\nis entirely fair for the Council to<br />\ncite this as a part of their work.<br />\nRegarding effort number four,<br />\nmembers of the SC researched<br />\nthe tuition question for over<br />\nthree weeks, meeting with all<br />\nrelevant administrators, including<br />\nPres. Muller. The conclusion<br />\nreached was that a price like was<br /><br />\ninevitable, and some effort was<br />\nmade to hold that incraease as<br />\nlow as possible. While it's no<br />\nglorious victory, it was certainly<br />\nworth note.<br />\nOn the face of it, Mr. D. seems<br />\nto have a good point about effort<br />\nnumber fourteen, the academic<br />\nreports. However, one question<br />\ncould ahve cleared up the<br />\nconfusion. The listing cited this<br />\nyear's efforts, including the<br />\ncreation of one SC committee<br />\nwith full responsibility for the<br />\nreports and one SC\u2014Academic<br />\nCouncil committee with<br />\nresponsibility for implementation<br />\nof the major suggestions.<br />\nMr. D.'s attack on effort<br />\nthirteen was really a low blow.<br />\nWhen the original course listings<br />\nwere released for this past<br />\nintersession, members of this<br />\nyear's SC, appalled at the low<br />\nnumber, visited professors<br />\nindividually. They were directly<br />\nresponsible for nine additional<br />\ncourses given over this past<br />\nintersession. This certainly is to<br />\ntheir credit.<br />\nTurning finally to the area of<br />\nFlying Monkey, lectureships,<br />\netc., I respond to Mr. D's analogy<br />\nwith one of my own. Do you<br /><br />\nreally believe that Pres. Muller<br />\nwrites his budget by himself?<br />\nEach of the areas mentioned in<br />\nthe ad are under the aegis of the<br />\nSC. The SC selects each of the<br />\nchairpeople, and the SC is<br />\ndirectly responsible for their<br />\nefforts. They get the flack if<br />\nthere is a failure and deserve the<br />\ncredit for a success. Consider Mr.<br />\nD.: you aren't on the masthead,<br />\nbut you are part of the<br />\nNews-Letter. Similarly, Flying<br />\nMonkey is a SC subcommittee of<br />\nthe SC Social Committee.<br />\nEven beyond the continual<br />\nmisrepresentations of Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin's article, the basic<br />\ntragedy is that he misses the<br />\npoint.

I've been<br />\nstruck in talking with recent<br />\napplicants who have come<br />\nthrough my office by the<br />\nunanimity of praise for Brown's<br />\noffice of admissions. (Harvard,<br />\non the other hand, seems to<br />\ncome in several notches below<br />\nHopkins!) One point that a<br />\nnumber of these visitors raised as<br />\nof at least symbolic value here<br />\nhas been the abandonment of<br />\nany sort of writing sample. I<br />\nrealize the difficulties and<br />\nimprecisions of using such<br />\nevidence, but it is one place in<br />\nwhich the candidate comes<br />\nthrough as a person. Related to<br />\nthis question would be the much<br />\nvexed one of trying to identify<br />\napplicants with \"creative<br />\npotential\"--the originality,<br />\nadaptive flexibility, and<br />\nsensitivity to problems that give<br />\nsome promise of a better leaven<br />\nin the classroom and of future<br />\nusefulness. I suppose that it is<br />\nnow a commonplace that a<br />\nfailure to identify this sort of<br />\napplicant strems from what H.G.<br />\nGough (of the Adjective Check<br />\nList) has styled the three<br />\nmisplaced emphases of college<br />\nadmissions: \"overemphasis on<br />\nt es t-d em onstrated intelligence,<br />\nunderemphasis on nonintellectual<br />\ndeterminants of achievment, and<br />\noveremphasis on the 'one true<br />\npath to grace'\u2014grades.\"<br />\n4) We also have a challenging<br />\nopportunity in the more effective<br />\nuse of our alumni (both<br />\nundergraduate and graduate) in<br />\nrecruiting nationally. Princeton,<br />\nwhich hardly a paragon in such<br />\nmatters, currently uses something<br />\nlike 1650 alumni aides. This is<br />\nobviously a two-edged sword (as<br />\na Princeton alumni interview of<br />\nmany years ago quickly reminds<br />\nme), but it is an area for shrewd<br />\ndevelopment, particularly in view<br />\nof the large stake that Hopkins<br />\nhas nationally in the professions<br />\nand in education.<br />\n5) An at present unused<br />\nnatural resource for frank,<br />\neffective presentations of<br />\nHopkins programs are those<br />\ngraduate students who are<br />\nfamiliar with both the current<br />\nfaculty and undergraduate<br />\nteaching. Clearly, this means the<br />\nexceptional and not the average<br />\ngraduate student; but I feel that<br />\nevery department has at least one<br />\nor two such highly motivated and<br />\nwell informed students. (In the<br />\npast I've tried to stake a lunch<br />\nfor the few promising applicants<br />\nwho reach us with two graduate<br />\nstudents whom I consider our<br />\nbest agents.) To make such a<br />\nprogram work, especially if it<br />\nmeant off-campus recruiting,<br />\nmight well mean some small<br />\nstipend (possibly under WorkStudy support). This group<br />\ncould be supplemented by<br />\narticulate undergraduates.<br />\n6) Target schools: An attempt<br />\nconcentrated on selected schools<br />\nto reach students other than<br />\npre-pre-meds when an admission<br />\nteam visits:<br />\na) A few public lectures or<br />\nreadings by highly visible, skilled<br />\n'performers' from the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity (There is something<br />\nsee MACKSEY, page 10<br /><br />\nAs the eagle .flew, sundav in the quad<br /><br />\nRevival of witchcraft hysteria is just around the corner<br />\nBy MIKE BELLOW<br />\nThe Salem witchcraft hysteria<br />\nof 1692 is generally dismissed as<br />\na product of a superstitious era<br />\nlong since outgrown.

We should try to<br />\nreflect the peculiarities as well as<br />\nthe pride of the place in our<br />\nliterature. There are few pages of<br />\nany catalogue upon which time<br />\nwill not cast a tinge of the<br />\nabsurd, so this means the burden<br />\nof constant revision. We need to<br />\ntry harder to reflect the genuine<br />\nattractiveness and significance of<br />\nthe place. In this vein, I've<br />\nconvinced at least myself that a<br />\nbrief, easily disposable Hopkins<br />\nhistory would be of interest to<br /><br />\nsornd applican's (copy on<br />\nrequest).<br />\nOBITER DICTA: i'd<br />\nlike to conclude thesc too long<br />\nnotesx with a few comments that<br />\nmay wobble between the<br />\nplatitudinous and the<br />\nsententious. We need to know<br />\nourselves better (a charge that<br />\nOedipus found as hard as Freud<br />\nto bear). We. need to<br />\ncommunicate the possibilities for<br />\nexcitement as well as hard work<br />\nwith greater effectiveness. We<br />\nneed to question whether some<br />\nof our goals haven't been lost in<br />\nthe shuffle. Despite indivdival<br />\ncommitments, the term<br />\n\"minority recruitment\" is not<br />\none that I hear much lately. And<br />\nwhere it is possible, we need to<br />\nshare some of our common<br />\nburdens. A joint conference on<br />\nadmissions might be a step<br />\ntoward this objective.<br />\nIn the past three or four 'years<br />\nI'm convinced that we have made<br />\nsome extraordinary advances in a<br />\nnumber of fields toward our<br />\nperennial goals. It's not a bad<br />\nseason to remember the people<br />\nwho have made this possbile. Yet<br />\nfaculty and new programs are<br />\nultimatedly only as effective at<br />\nthe undergraduate level as the<br />\nstudents who use them. Unless<br />\nwe can attract sharper, more<br />\nengaged undergraduates in<br />\ncertain fields - people who can<br />\ngalvanize the rest - I foresee the<br />\nground we have won in terms of<br />\nfaculty., involvement in<br />\nundergraduate teaching eroding<br />\nand many colleaglies pulling back<br />\ninto the more familiar graduate<br />\nand research postures. Our hope<br />\nfor Hopkins has always been not<br />\njust the coexistence of these<br />\nthree elements but their creative<br />\ninteraction. Most of us are<br />\nwilling to give up the alleged<br />\nadvantages of bigness and<br />\ndelegated responsibility in the<br />\nhope that this interaction can be<br />\nbetter achieved. For certain<br />\nstudents in certain fields I'm<br />\nconvinced that this may be the<br />\nbest place in the country (which<br />\nis not to say ideal!), but if the<br />\nnews is a closely held secret<br />\nreacing no one outside the walls,<br />\nwe might as well go back to our<br />\ncells.<br />\nDr. Richard<br />\nMacksey is Director of the<br />\nHumanities Center.<br /><br />\nit hurts us too<br /><br />\nUse by Barnstormers hurts listening and viewing room<br />\nBy BOBBY RIGGS<br />\nLighting and sound<br />\nmalfunctions, and damage to<br />\nelectrical circuitry in the<br />\nListening-Viewing Room has<br />\nresulted from the adaptation of<br />\nthe facility for use by the<br />\nBarnstormers, according to<br />\nDirector of Student Activities<br />\nChris Columbo.<br />\nDifficulties<br />\nMost of the difficulties<br />\ninvolved the lighting and sound<br />\nsystems of the L-V room.<br />\nColumbo said that at times the<br />\nmain speakers did not work<br />\nproperly.
