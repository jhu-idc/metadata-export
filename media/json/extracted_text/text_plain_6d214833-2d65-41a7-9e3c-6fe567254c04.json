Calvert St., Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 16, 1926.<br />\n<br />\n\"THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH\" VERY LITTLE<br />\nOf late years, the NEWS-LETTER has made a very commend'able effort to avoid triteness as much as possible. Consequently the unexpected has collie to be more or less expected, especially in the editorial column. However, we take the liberty of<br />\ndeserting this estimable policy temporarily, and expressing<br />\nsome of the venerable \"old order changeth\" ideas.<br />\nFirst, a word in regard to the recently departed seniors of<br />\nthe staff. They did their work well, and succeeded in leaving<br />\nthe paper better than they found it. They were conscientous<br />\nexecutives and pleasant working mates; if higher praise can be<br />\nbestowed on college journalists, it is yet to be discovered. We<br />\ntake the paper from their hands with the sense of having a<br />\ngood foundation to work on, and a high standard to uphold.<br />\nSo far, so good. The rub comes in the ways and means of<br />\nupholding these standards, or, to state the question more baldly, the policy of .the NEW'S-LETTER. There seem to be two distinct opinions on the matter. Many think that the NEWSLETTER should hark back to its custom of a few years ago and<br />\nact as an impartial recorder of campus opinion. On the other<br />\nhand about an equal number hold the opposite view, which has<br />\nprevailed recently, that the editorial should be an expression<br />\nof personal opinion.<br />\nLaying ourselves open to charges of moral cowardice, if not<br />\n4-6f---ab-S-Olute-moral turpitude, we decline to- adopt either of the<br />\nclear cut positions, but prefer rather to struggle along the<br />\n\"misty flats\" of the middle course..<br />\nWe feel that it is practically impossible to carry out the first<br />\nidea\u2014that of recording campus opinion. In the first place it<br />\nis very difficult to find out what campus opinion really is. Ten<br />\nmen, fired by some great idea, and with any proclivities for<br />\ntalking, may make quite a stir on the campus, although they<br />\nare opposed by several times as many of their more phlegmate<br />\nfellows. So short of sending out a questionnaire, what the<br />\ncampus thinks, when it thinks at all, is something of a riddle.<br />\nAs for the second theory, the constant appearance in print<br />\nof the editor's personal opinions and whims, will, unless he is<br />\nvery exceptional, soon become a bore, and will carry very little<br />\nweight.<br />\nIn view of these considerations, the NEWS-LETTER shall adhere to the above mentioned middle course. We shall appear<br />\nneither as an unpersonal oracle, nor shall we give vent to irresponsible musings. But selecting as issues subjects upon<br />\nwhich campus opinion is divided, we shall then venture our own<br />\nopinion.<br />\nTo come down to earth, all that this rather pompous declarato show is that the NEWS-LETTER policy has changed<br />\ntivn<br />\nvorv little.<br />\n<br />\nAlong with the other fast-fading Seniors, Yes and No is on<br />\nthe verge of a mental, physical and moral breakdown. Consequently, the editors of the NEWS-LETTER are looking about<br />\nthem for another ambiguity of the type that enjoys scribbling<br />\na few well chosen words at the head of another's contribution.<br />\nIf there be such at large, let him proceed to make a noise, and<br />\nlo! the one and only and original Yes and No shall hark,\u2014if<br />\nnot heed. If none such there be who is, at least, a genius, it is<br />\nwritten, aye and sworn, that this column will temain in the<br />\nbosom of that great, big family which is the NEWS-LETTER editorial staff. In the face of such a calamity, brethren, we call<br />\nupon you to rise up in your wrath and smite your typewriters.<br />\nThe first of the smitings follows:<br />\n\"We lament\u2014and with all our lamenting are amused.<br />\nAnd could there be any more amusing or gratifying pastime than to 'sit in' at any one of numerous, gatherings<br />\nheld about the campus under the dubious title of class<br />\nand board meetings, particularly during a time when 'elections' are in order. We like to sit in a secluded corner<br />\nand watch the inner and outer workings of the political<br />\nmachinery of our glorious fellows in learning. There is<br />\n:oinething refreshing in 'absolute puerility. It gives us<br />\nsuch a satisfying sense of our own perspicacity.<br />\n-We contend that it is amusing since in our old-fashionedness 'election' connotates the passing of divine right<br />\nto the rule of. the ruled. But not so at Hopkins; in the<br />\nscholarly atmosphere of our mossy traditions we pass year<br />\nin and year out allowing the 'personality pluses' to appoint<br />\nthemsetves. They are elected in form; appointed in spirit.<br />\nUnfortunately, it seems to us, the great gods, personality,<br />\nfraternity rating and athletic record are not sure guides<br />\nto determine eligibility for office, and that in choosing<br />\nsuch officers personal adaptability is left utterly out of<br />\naccount. For witness any so-called election on the campus. Nominations are always in abundance. We feel<br />\ngrateful when some one stops them before a roll call is<br />\ntaken. But we wait in vain for the nominators to substantiate their choice by verbal platform.<br />\n\"Further we hazard that there is confusion in the mind<br />\nof the undergraduate as to the meaning of the word 'discussion,' for at the invitation to participate in this discussion of candidates there is shuffling, hesitancy and then - - sweet, beautiful silence. As it stands there is a show of<br />\nhands, a mumble of 'ayes,' perhaps, and a 'great big campus leader' is elected. But to repeat, that word 'discussion,' it seems to produce a sort of Stage fright pr panacea<br />\nto the end that thought, constructive or destructive, ceases<br />\nimmediately in favor of a vague wandering hope that by it<br />\nspin and roll chance the right man will be elected any way.<br />\n\"Our amusement resolves itself into wondering what<br />\nmental inhibitory process functions whereby ideas are assassinated rather than associated.

Consequently the unexpected has collie to be more or less expected, especially in the editorial column. However, we take the liberty of<br />\ndeserting this estimable policy temporarily, and expressing<br />\nsome of the venerable \"old order changeth\" ideas.<br />\nFirst, a word in regard to the recently departed seniors of<br />\nthe staff. They did their work well, and succeeded in leaving<br />\nthe paper better than they found it. They were conscientous<br />\nexecutives and pleasant working mates; if higher praise can be<br />\nbestowed on college journalists, it is yet to be discovered. We<br />\ntake the paper from their hands with the sense of having a<br />\ngood foundation to work on, and a high standard to uphold.<br />\nSo far, so good. The rub comes in the ways and means of<br />\nupholding these standards, or, to state the question more baldly, the policy of .the NEW'S-LETTER. There seem to be two distinct opinions on the matter. Many think that the NEWSLETTER should hark back to its custom of a few years ago and<br />\nact as an impartial recorder of campus opinion. On the other<br />\nhand about an equal number hold the opposite view, which has<br />\nprevailed recently, that the editorial should be an expression<br />\nof personal opinion.<br />\nLaying ourselves open to charges of moral cowardice, if not<br />\n4-6f---ab-S-Olute-moral turpitude, we decline to- adopt either of the<br />\nclear cut positions, but prefer rather to struggle along the<br />\n\"misty flats\" of the middle course..<br />\nWe feel that it is practically impossible to carry out the first<br />\nidea\u2014that of recording campus opinion. In the first place it<br />\nis very difficult to find out what campus opinion really is. Ten<br />\nmen, fired by some great idea, and with any proclivities for<br />\ntalking, may make quite a stir on the campus, although they<br />\nare opposed by several times as many of their more phlegmate<br />\nfellows. So short of sending out a questionnaire, what the<br />\ncampus thinks, when it thinks at all, is something of a riddle.<br />\nAs for the second theory, the constant appearance in print<br />\nof the editor's personal opinions and whims, will, unless he is<br />\nvery exceptional, soon become a bore, and will carry very little<br />\nweight.<br />\nIn view of these considerations, the NEWS-LETTER shall adhere to the above mentioned middle course. We shall appear<br />\nneither as an unpersonal oracle, nor shall we give vent to irresponsible musings. But selecting as issues subjects upon<br />\nwhich campus opinion is divided, we shall then venture our own<br />\nopinion.<br />\nTo come down to earth, all that this rather pompous declarato show is that the NEWS-LETTER policy has changed<br />\ntivn<br />\nvorv little.<br /><br />\nAlong with the other fast-fading Seniors, Yes and No is on<br />\nthe verge of a mental, physical and moral breakdown. Consequently, the editors of the NEWS-LETTER are looking about<br />\nthem for another ambiguity of the type that enjoys scribbling<br />\na few well chosen words at the head of another's contribution.<br />\nIf there be such at large, let him proceed to make a noise, and<br />\nlo! the one and only and original Yes and No shall hark,\u2014if<br />\nnot heed. If none such there be who is, at least, a genius, it is<br />\nwritten, aye and sworn, that this column will temain in the<br />\nbosom of that great, big family which is the NEWS-LETTER editorial staff. In the face of such a calamity, brethren, we call<br />\nupon you to rise up in your wrath and smite your typewriters.<br />\nThe first of the smitings follows:<br />\n\"We lament\u2014and with all our lamenting are amused.<br />\nAnd could there be any more amusing or gratifying pastime than to 'sit in' at any one of numerous, gatherings<br />\nheld about the campus under the dubious title of class<br />\nand board meetings, particularly during a time when 'elections' are in order. We like to sit in a secluded corner<br />\nand watch the inner and outer workings of the political<br />\nmachinery of our glorious fellows in learning. There is<br />\n:oinething refreshing in 'absolute puerility. It gives us<br />\nsuch a satisfying sense of our own perspicacity.<br />\n-We contend that it is amusing since in our old-fashionedness 'election' connotates the passing of divine right<br />\nto the rule of. the ruled. But not so at Hopkins; in the<br />\nscholarly atmosphere of our mossy traditions we pass year<br />\nin and year out allowing the 'personality pluses' to appoint<br />\nthemsetves. They are elected in form; appointed in spirit.<br />\nUnfortunately, it seems to us, the great gods, personality,<br />\nfraternity rating and athletic record are not sure guides<br />\nto determine eligibility for office, and that in choosing<br />\nsuch officers personal adaptability is left utterly out of<br />\naccount. For witness any so-called election on the campus. Nominations are always in abundance. We feel<br />\ngrateful when some one stops them before a roll call is<br />\ntaken. But we wait in vain for the nominators to substantiate their choice by verbal platform.<br />\n\"Further we hazard that there is confusion in the mind<br />\nof the undergraduate as to the meaning of the word 'discussion,' for at the invitation to participate in this discussion of candidates there is shuffling, hesitancy and then - - sweet, beautiful silence. As it stands there is a show of<br />\nhands, a mumble of 'ayes,' perhaps, and a 'great big campus leader' is elected. But to repeat, that word 'discussion,' it seems to produce a sort of Stage fright pr panacea<br />\nto the end that thought, constructive or destructive, ceases<br />\nimmediately in favor of a vague wandering hope that by it<br />\nspin and roll chance the right man will be elected any way.<br />\n\"Our amusement resolves itself into wondering what<br />\nmental inhibitory process functions whereby ideas are assassinated rather than associated.
