The appearance of Dean Rusk on our<br />\ncampus is said to confirm this<br />\npolicy. The Republican position<br />\non Viet Nam, as probably best<br />\nexpressed by former Vice-President Nixon, has been criticized<br />\nby a New York Times editorial<br />\nof October 11, 1965 as being a<br />\ngross simplification of an immensely complex problem.<br />\nI am willing to grant the fact<br />\nthat there are stupendous political and diplomatic stumbling<br />\n<br />\nblocks to a solution.

The record in<br />\nViet Nam since 1954 shows a willingness and a desire to try<br />\nsomething other than a dictatorship which would deprive all<br />\nfreedom. In 1176, the U.S. made<br />\na commitment to John Locke's<br />\ninalienable rights: life, liberty,<br />\n<br />\nproperty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Declaration said all<br />\nmen were entitled to these rights.<br />\nIt did not say all men had to<br />\naccept them. All Communist regimes have taken away these<br />\nrights, often by force. The policy<br />\nof the U.S. has not been to fight<br />\nfor these rights after they have<br />\nbeen surrendered. War has been<br />\nwaged only when established<br />\nrights have been threatened by a<br />\nsuppressive outside force.

In the Theater Hopkins'<br />\nourrent production of Ionesco's<br />\n\"The Killer,\" we have an excellent portrayal of the possibilities<br />\nof this kind of theater, as well as<br />\nof its limitations. The action of<br />\nthe play takes place in a \"radiant city\" where the radiance is<br />\nIndistinguishable from the dull,<br />\nheavy greyness that pervades<br />\nthe brightness. The tinsel-like<br />\ngreenery surrounding the setting,<br />\ntastefully designed by James Edmund Brady, formerly of the Old<br />\nVic, adds to this ambiguous unreality. The lighting. designed by<br />\nRobert Hassinger, often substitutes for real objects of the<br />\nStage. The clever use of projection techniques bo assimilate the<br />\nimmediate background of the<br />\nscene also heightens the meehanical, yet subjective naturalism of the play.<br />\n<br />\nplace-evil force in the city, Irvin<br />\nTurner is quite convincing.<br />\nThe difficult task of transforming and vulgar into the absurd,<br />\nthe boring into the shocking,<br />\nthen, is greatly dependent on<br />\nskilled acting and directing. The<br />\nHopkins<br />\nproduction<br />\nprovides<br />\nboth. Ed Golden's juxtaposition<br />\nof concrete sounds, setting, and<br />\nlighting with imagined objects<br />\nheightens the real-unreal effect<br />\nof the play. The body movements<br />\nof the actors, the combined<br />\nmovements of the actors, particularly in the chaotic scenes of<br />\nAct III, the oharacter development\u2014all attest to excellent direction.<br />\nThe only problem (and this<br />\nproblem has to do with the play<br />\nand not the performance) is that<br />\nIonesco does not really transcend<br />\nthe world he has reproduced.<br />\nEven his progressive intensification of shocking transformations<br />\ninto absurdity, are too often as<br />\nquickly transformed. like the<br />\nkick before the last drag or an<br />\noverused Playboy, into boredom.<br />\nThe characters, devoid of strong<br />\nconflict within or among themselves, are too often like mechanical sponges. And then, in<br />\nthe end, evil triumphs, though<br />\nsomewhat too easily. But by<br />\nskilled, often ingenious work of<br />\nacting and directing, the Hopkins group has made Ionesco<br />\ngood theater, wanting of our<br />\nattention, if not delight.

Stanley Kubrick learnid<br />\nfilm making by watching the<br />\nfilms in the Museum of Modern<br />\nArts collection over a two year<br />\nperiod. It is apparent that this<br />\nmethod of study is an excellent<br />\nway to learn film making.<br />\nDespite the high .cost of films<br />\ntoday there is a smal group<br />\nof film makers who learn about<br />\nfilm making by making films.<br />\nMost notable in this group is<br />\nRoger Carman who has made<br />\nabout fifty films in the past ten<br />\nyears and is just now being realized as a competent film maker.<br />\nSidney Lumet is another one,<br />\n<br />\nof these film makers who makes<br />\nfilms as a method of study. Unlike the French directors who allude to the style of other directors as a tribute, Lumet merely<br />\nlifts the technique and style of<br />\nother directors and pawns it off<br />\nas his own. The elements of<br />\nother directors styles are always<br />\npresent in Lumet's films. In the<br />\nPawnbroker he tried some of<br />\nAlain Resnais' (Night and Fog,<br />\nLast Year at Marienbad) techniques and now in The Hill Lumet tries Kubrick and others. It<br />\nremains to be seen if this method<br />\nof film making is good training.<br />\nLumet's method of film making is not entirely dishonest, because, despite his employment of<br />\nformulas that seem to succeed<br />\n<br />\nfinancially, he is constantly experimenting within these frameworks. In some cases it is beginning to be apparent that he is<br />\ndeveloping his own style\u2014particularly in his use of sound<br />\nmontage, (the end of Failsafe<br />\nand The Hill), and his photographic techniques. Lumet makes<br />\nmany mistakes, but in many<br />\ncfses it is because he purposely<br />\nchooses difficult material which<br />\nsomeday he may be capable of<br />\nhandling.<br />\n<br />\nParts of the film are inexplicable because some of the characters are not properly identified in<br />\nparticular scenes.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hill. Lumet's latest film,<br />\nnow at the Playhouse, is about<br />\na military prison of the British<br />\narmy during the Second World<br />\nWar. Actually as it turns out the<br />\nprison is merely a convenient<br />\n<br />\nSean Connery puts on a remarkable performance and certainly demonstrates that he is<br />\na much more serious actor than<br />\nthe James Bond films might indicate.<br />\n<br />\nelement, a microcosm of the<br />\narmy and humanity in general.<br />\nAt first the film appears to be a<br />\ndocumented study of sadism but<br />\ngradually other elements are<br />\nbrought into consideration. Unfortunately the quality of the<br />\nsound is rather poor and this in<br />\ncombination with the heavy<br />\nBritish accents it is possible to<br />\nmiss much of the dialogue.<br />\n<br />\nThe most apparent reason for<br />\nthe failure of the film is the<br />\nobviousness of the elements in<br />\nthe film .. . the Negro, the<br />\ndrunk the fatman the homosexual, and the in.subordinant<br />\ncriminal hero.<br />\nDesipte all the failings the<br />\nfilm is worth seeing for the experimentation in editing, (Lumet<br />\nbreaks the rules by cutting from<br />\nshots of heads composed on the<br />\nleft of the screen to shots composed on the right of the screen)<br />\nthe use of hand held camera<br />\nshots, and of course the acting<br />\non the part of Sean Connery.<br />\nUnlike Stanley Kubrick's Paths<br />\nof Glory, The Hill ends on a<br />\nrather pessimistic note.<br />\nJeD<br />\n.11<br />\n<br />\nTriviality of Trivia<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSmashing Success<br />\n(Continued from Page 5)<br />\ncleric in Lenny Bruce's prison<br />\nmovie routine.

The appearance of Dean Rusk on our<br />\ncampus is said to confirm this<br />\npolicy. The Republican position<br />\non Viet Nam, as probably best<br />\nexpressed by former Vice-President Nixon, has been criticized<br />\nby a New York Times editorial<br />\nof October 11, 1965 as being a<br />\ngross simplification of an immensely complex problem.<br />\nI am willing to grant the fact<br />\nthat there are stupendous political and diplomatic stumbling<br /><br />\nblocks to a solution.

The record in<br />\nViet Nam since 1954 shows a willingness and a desire to try<br />\nsomething other than a dictatorship which would deprive all<br />\nfreedom. In 1176, the U.S. made<br />\na commitment to John Locke's<br />\ninalienable rights: life, liberty,<br /><br />\nproperty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Declaration said all<br />\nmen were entitled to these rights.<br />\nIt did not say all men had to<br />\naccept them. All Communist regimes have taken away these<br />\nrights, often by force. The policy<br />\nof the U.S. has not been to fight<br />\nfor these rights after they have<br />\nbeen surrendered. War has been<br />\nwaged only when established<br />\nrights have been threatened by a<br />\nsuppressive outside force.

In the Theater Hopkins'<br />\nourrent production of Ionesco's<br />\n\"The Killer,\" we have an excellent portrayal of the possibilities<br />\nof this kind of theater, as well as<br />\nof its limitations. The action of<br />\nthe play takes place in a \"radiant city\" where the radiance is<br />\nIndistinguishable from the dull,<br />\nheavy greyness that pervades<br />\nthe brightness. The tinsel-like<br />\ngreenery surrounding the setting,<br />\ntastefully designed by James Edmund Brady, formerly of the Old<br />\nVic, adds to this ambiguous unreality. The lighting. designed by<br />\nRobert Hassinger, often substitutes for real objects of the<br />\nStage.

Ed Golden's juxtaposition<br />\nof concrete sounds, setting, and<br />\nlighting with imagined objects<br />\nheightens the real-unreal effect<br />\nof the play. The body movements<br />\nof the actors, the combined<br />\nmovements of the actors, particularly in the chaotic scenes of<br />\nAct III, the oharacter development\u2014all attest to excellent direction.<br />\nThe only problem (and this<br />\nproblem has to do with the play<br />\nand not the performance) is that<br />\nIonesco does not really transcend<br />\nthe world he has reproduced.<br />\nEven his progressive intensification of shocking transformations<br />\ninto absurdity, are too often as<br />\nquickly transformed. like the<br />\nkick before the last drag or an<br />\noverused Playboy, into boredom.<br />\nThe characters, devoid of strong<br />\nconflict within or among themselves, are too often like mechanical sponges. And then, in<br />\nthe end, evil triumphs, though<br />\nsomewhat too easily. But by<br />\nskilled, often ingenious work of<br />\nacting and directing, the Hopkins group has made Ionesco<br />\ngood theater, wanting of our<br />\nattention, if not delight.

It is apparent that this<br />\nmethod of study is an excellent<br />\nway to learn film making.<br />\nDespite the high .cost of films<br />\ntoday there is a smal group<br />\nof film makers who learn about<br />\nfilm making by making films.<br />\nMost notable in this group is<br />\nRoger Carman who has made<br />\nabout fifty films in the past ten<br />\nyears and is just now being realized as a competent film maker.<br />\nSidney Lumet is another one,<br /><br />\nof these film makers who makes<br />\nfilms as a method of study. Unlike the French directors who allude to the style of other directors as a tribute, Lumet merely<br />\nlifts the technique and style of<br />\nother directors and pawns it off<br />\nas his own. The elements of<br />\nother directors styles are always<br />\npresent in Lumet's films. In the<br />\nPawnbroker he tried some of<br />\nAlain Resnais' (Night and Fog,<br />\nLast Year at Marienbad) techniques and now in The Hill Lumet tries Kubrick and others. It<br />\nremains to be seen if this method<br />\nof film making is good training.<br />\nLumet's method of film making is not entirely dishonest, because, despite his employment of<br />\nformulas that seem to succeed<br /><br />\nfinancially, he is constantly experimenting within these frameworks. In some cases it is beginning to be apparent that he is<br />\ndeveloping his own style\u2014particularly in his use of sound<br />\nmontage, (the end of Failsafe<br />\nand The Hill), and his photographic techniques. Lumet makes<br />\nmany mistakes, but in many<br />\ncfses it is because he purposely<br />\nchooses difficult material which<br />\nsomeday he may be capable of<br />\nhandling.<br /><br />\nParts of the film are inexplicable because some of the characters are not properly identified in<br />\nparticular scenes.<br /><br />\nThe Hill.
