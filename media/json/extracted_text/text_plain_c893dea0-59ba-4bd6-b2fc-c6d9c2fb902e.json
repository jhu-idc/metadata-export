Although the column has been open in but<br />\n,<br />\n11<br />\none issue of the paper, the sum of $15 has already been realized, and,<br />\nwhile the contributions have not yet become general in character, it is<br />\n* 4expected<br />\nthat before the next issue of the NEWS-LETTE,R the amount<br />\n*<br />\n********* \u2022<br />\nwill have at least doubled the present sum on hand. We do not wish it<br />\nto be supposed, that, because the three contributions thus far made<br />\namount to $5 each, we would not gladly and thankfully accept much<br />\nsmaller amounts, for, indeed, the original purpose of the idea was for the Fund to draw on<br />\nthe loose change, which the students might have from time to time in their pockets, and which<br />\ncould not be otherwise put to any economic use. It may be interesting to mention here that<br />\nthe New York Evening Post printed Saturday, November 10, a detailed outline of the purpose<br />\nof the Student Contribution Fund, calling attention to the fact that we hope, by means of the<br />\nFund, to erect or purchase some suitable memorial for one of the new buildings at Homewood,<br />\nwhich memorial will probably be a corner-stone for one of the buildings. To raise the required<br />\namount of money, it will doubtless be necessary to carry on the Fund for several years, or<br />\nuntil the present Freshman Class will have attained graduating honors.<br />\n<br />\nUROPE had her Martin Luther; America has had her Carrie Nation; and<br />\nnow from out the low-roofed recesses of the gymnasium locker room<br />\nconies an ever-swelling cry for a leader to head in a reform against certain<br />\nabuses there existing. Moved by the justice of the cry, the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\ngirding its loins with the apron of determination, and bearing aloft the<br />\nstaff of righteousness, has responded to the call, and taken up the cause<br />\nof the lovers of sanitation. Our slogan is \"Excelsior,\" and our motto<br />\n,41[441<br />\nis<br />\n\"New brushes and combs for the locker room.\" There's not to<br />\nE3<br />\nE3<br />\nreason<br />\nwhy, but someone has blundered. Can the responsible \"o<br />\n. ne give<br />\nst<br />\nsufficient cause and reason for the fact that one of the hair brushes is<br />\nwithout a handle? If so, let him show reason why the devasting germs of baldness have been<br />\nallowed to pluck all but a few of the bristles from the other brush, until, alas! it is late, too<br />\nlate, for even Hermicide. Let him justify the fact that for some time our sturdy athletes<br />\nhave been obliged to affect their coiffures by means of combs (?), whose toothless gums give<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\na mocking lie to usefulness. BUT THAT IS NOT ALL! If, indeed, we must use bristleless brushes and toothless gum, why can't they be kept at least clean, and not in the repulsive<br />\ncondition now characteristic of them? We do not know who is the one responsible for the<br />\ntonsorial equipment of the locker room, but whoever he is, let him hear otxr appeal. And,<br />\nfurther, let him have a few inches of the dust, now stratified on the benches in the gallery of<br />\nthe cage, removed to the geological laboratory in order that seating space might be given those<br />\nstudents who would like to watch the team practices from the gallery.<br />\n<br />\nOW that the year is well started, it is possible to\u2022 see some of the results<br />\nof the four years' course\u2014at least as far as it affects the number of men<br />\nin the University. We are somewhat sorry to note that, despite the fact<br />\nthat two classes were supposed to enter this fall, there are only about<br />\n60 new men, and of the strictly four-year men, only about 30.<br />\nProbably if the men entering in the future will be limited strictly to the<br />\nfour-years' course, the size of the undergraduate body may eventually<br />\nincrease to about 200 from the present 160. But, if, as may be seen<br />\nfrom the catalogue, various loopholes are to be left open by which all those,<br />\nwho are more disposed to study than anything else, may squeeze themselves through in three years, the number of undergraduates will probably not increase. The<br />\nsmall size of the Undergraduate Department has always, we believe, been disadvantageous to<br />\nthe University. A strong mind dwells only in a healthy body; our Post-graduate Department<br />\nneeds a large body of collegiates to support it and furnish it material.<br />\nVERY day draws nearer to the time when the classes will have their banquets. The Freshman Banquet is looked forward to by all, both concerned and otherwise. Every year the Freshman Banquet stirs tip the<br />\nFreshmen into nervous excitement for at least two weeks ahead of the<br />\ndate, and the Juniors spend much of their not very valuable time in<br />\nspying and scouting. This was the case last year. The theory is of<br />\ncourse that the Freshmen have no right to a banquet, any more than a<br />\nfive-year old has to high-balls and cigarettes. We do not care to bring<br />\nup this weighty question; but the point is that the Freshman Banquet,<br />\nas now held, seriously interrupts the work of the University. Of<br />\ncourse, it is easy enough to suggest that either the Freshmen shall not give their banquet until<br />\narriving at the age of discretion or else the Juniors shall not interfere. It requires no experiment to see that neither of these expedients would work successfully.<br />\nPerhaps a compromise can be effected. Let the two classes come to terms, the Juniors<br />\non their part promising not to interfere with the Freshmen within four blocks of the University;<br />\nthe Freshmen on their part promising not to cut their classes, and also to publish the true date<br />\nof the banquet. Each sides concedes a vital advantage to the other side, which would tend to<br />\nsimplify matters and help the work of the University.<br />\nTO?<br />\nNot as summer seas are her eyes of blue,<br />\nNor her cheeks as the blush of the morn,<br />\nHer lips are not kissed with morning dew,<br />\nLow lieing on lowland and lawn;<br />\nNot as Araby wind is her fragrant breath,<br />\nNor strands of gold is her hair\u2014<br />\nAnd yet my lady, my fond heart saith,<br />\nIs, of women, passing fair.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nA FEW SPELLING-REFORM FALLACIES.<br />\nThe spelling reform advocated by the Simplified Spelling Board has evoked, instead of<br />\nthe chilling indifference which such efforts so<br />\noften meet, an encouraging amount of opposition. The real ground of most opposition to<br />\nthe simpler forms is merely that they are<br />\nunfamiliar; yet few are thoughtful enough to<br />\nrecognize this or frank enough to admit it.<br />\nSome of the popular objections to them are<br />\nbased upon curiously false notions.<br />\nWhat may be called the Roosevelt fallacy is<br />\none of the most interesting of these notions.<br />\nIn the late midsummer, when journalists<br />\nlanguisht for something to make a sensation<br />\nout of, President Roosevelt directed the Public<br />\nPrinter to adopt the three hundred simpler<br />\nforms selected by the Board. The effect of<br />\nthis order was magical. Correspondents made<br />\ncopy of it by the yard; patriots who do not<br />\nread a government report once in ten years<br />\nprotested bitterly at the desecration of those<br />\ndocuments by revolutionary English; and an<br />\nEnglish journal remarked contemptuously that<br />\nthe reformed spelling might be good enough<br />\nfor a nation of yesterday, but would never do<br />\nfor a people blest with a tradition of a thousand years. The result was that, in the minds<br />\nof many persons, the responsibility of the<br />\nwhole reform was laid on the broad shoulders<br />\nof the President, and the Simplified Spelling<br />\nbecame the \"Roosevelt Spelling.\" Consegently there are those who do not like the<br />\nsimpler forms because they do not approve of<br />\nMr. Roosevelt, and are hardly to be persuaded<br />\nthat he is not at the bottom of the whole thing.<br />\nYet it is hard to see, apart from political<br />\nprejudice, why the government printing house<br />\nshould necessarily be the least up-to-date.<br />\nIndeed, since the official reports are all practical in purpose and quite out of the realm of<br />\npure literature, they are especially fitted for<br />\ntempting usage with desirable simplifications.<br />\nCertainly, nobody's esthetic sense can be<br />\nseriously offended by Mru in an agricultural<br />\nreport.<br />\nThe authorityfallacy is almost the converse<br />\nof the Roosevelt fallacy. \"What right has a<br />\nself-constituted board to dictate how I shall<br />\nspell?\" says an objector. \"We should have<br />\na cabinet officer to supervise language,\"<br />\n<br />\nurges another, \"or a representative convention called by the government to propose<br />\nreforms.\" Now, of course, the Simplified<br />\nSpelling Board makes no assumption of authority, tho the changes which it proposes are<br />\nbased upon the soundest scholarship. In the<br />\nrepublic of intellect there are no dictators;<br />\nanybody has a right to make a motion and to<br />\nget it carried if he can.<br />\nThe etymologicalfallacy is a great favorite<br />\nwith everybody except the etymologist. It is<br />\ndoubly fallacious, because the simplified<br />\nspellings do not, as a rule, obscure the history<br />\nof the words, and if they did, no great harm<br />\nwould result. Popular off-hand etymologizing<br />\nis less reliable than popular diagnosis of diseases. The untrained reader who wants to<br />\nknow the history of a word should consult all<br />\nthe good dictionaries within reach, and should<br />\nremember that even they are not infallible.<br />\nHe will know what a debt is long before he<br />\nlearns that the word is related to the Latin<br />\ndebitum. When he knows that, it will be a<br />\nshort step to the knowledge that the useless<br />\n\"b\" was rudely forced into the word as a<br />\nsign of its origin, a sign wholly false to its<br />\nhistory. The fact that doul, delite, sovran,<br />\nrime, agast and iland are etymological, and<br />\nthat the current spellings are the results of deliberate interference with their development,<br />\nmay serve as a starting point for wholesome<br />\ndistrust of the historical value of our present<br />\nspelling. If we spelled alms so as to show its<br />\norigin, the form should be eleemosyne. Some<br />\nday we shall muster up enough courage to<br />\nspell it ams.<br />\nThe language-of-Shakespearefallacy, tho one<br />\nof the lest reasonable, is perhappes the moast<br />\nseductive; for it gives toe the dres in whiche<br />\nthe gret monuments of Englishe lytterature<br />\nappere to-daie the reverense dewe to those<br />\nmonumentes themselves.

C.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nPLEA FOR UNDERGRADUATE FOOTBALL.<br />\n\"'The time has come,' the walrus said,<br />\n'To talk of many thing,<br />\nOf shoes, and ships, and sealing-wax,<br />\nOf cabbages and king.'\"<br />\nThe time has indeed come, to have an undergraduate football team at John Hopkins.<br />\nThe team, this year, has not been very successful, owing to several causes. In the first<br />\nplace, the game, as changed by the new rules,<br />\nmakes it imperative that a team have out-door<br />\npractice. The new trick plays absolutely<br />\nneed out-door practice to insure their success,<br />\nand out-door practice is an impossibility under<br />\nthe present system. If we had an undergraduate team, we could get out-door practice<br />\non Wednesday afternoons, at least, and even<br />\none afternoon would work wonderful results<br />\nin a team. As we rely upon the men from<br />\nthe Medical School to form the backbone of<br />\nthe team, we can not get any out-door practice<br />\nat all. Instead, we have to be content with<br />\npractices in the cage from 6 p. in. to 7 p. m.<br />\nThat means that the team must have supper<br />\nevery Monday, Wednesday and Friday night,<br />\nand this supper item is one of the largest<br />\nexpenses that the management has to put up<br />\nwith. With an undergraduate team, practices<br />\nwould start promptly at 5, and would stop at<br />\n6. The men would have ample time to get<br />\nhome for supper, and thus relieve the management of a heavy load.<br />\nAgain, an undergraduate team could be<br />\ngotten which would train hard. That was<br />\none of the faults of this year's team, for there<br />\nwas little or no training done. The men from<br />\nthe Medical School can not be blamed, for not<br />\ntraining; it is too much for us to expect it of<br />\nthem, but an undergraduate team could be<br />\nmade to train and to train hard. We get out<br />\nlacrosse and track teams that are willing to<br />\n<br />\nTHAT FATAL SMILE.<br />\nThere once lived a fellow named Dewey,<br />\nWho lived in the City St. Lewey,<br />\nWhen asked why he fed<br />\nOn oatmeal, he said:<br />\n\"Because I like things that are gewey.\"<br />\n<br />\ntrain, and there is no reason at all why we<br />\nshould not get out a football team which<br />\nwould be willing to train.<br />\nDissenters will say that the advantages<br />\nderived from out-door practice and training<br />\nwill not, by any means, measure up to the<br />\nadvantages of having men from the Medical<br />\nSchool who have played before and who know<br />\nthe game. As a matter of fact, owing to the<br />\nchanged style of play of football, the experienced men are not much better off than the<br />\nnew men, for they are compelled to unlearn<br />\nmany things before they can adapt themselves<br />\nto the new conditions.<br />\nThere is plenty of good football material<br />\namong the classes, which needs just a little<br />\ncoaching to turn into 'Varsity material.<br />\nDoubtless, the team would not be a worldbeater the first year or so, but as soon as an<br />\nefficient scrub is developed, we might look for<br />\nwinning teams. Under the present system<br />\nthere is practically no scrub at all, because<br />\nthe undergraduates will not come out at 6.30<br />\nand be kept out until 7.30, getting cold<br />\nsuppers at home. It stands to reason that<br />\nthe undergraduates will not come out and<br />\nscrub against a team in which they are not<br />\ninterested. But with an undergraduate team,<br />\nit is safe to predict that every practice will<br />\nsee a scrub team out, just as there is always a<br />\nscrub team for lacrosse and plenty of \"alsorans\" for track.<br />\nThere are, of course, reasons why we should<br />\nnot attempt a team next year based upon the<br />\nundergraduate students, but to the writer it<br />\nseems that the reasons in favor of a collegiate<br />\nteam outweigh the others. So let us see<br />\neveryone turn out to make a good representative team next year.<br />\n<br />\nALAN M.

So far,<br />\nthe Freshmen seem to have had the larger<br />\nsquad out, but the Juniors have not been<br />\nexactly napping. In fact, Captain Abel, of<br />\nthe Junior team is wearing a worried look<br />\nnow all the time, and is earnestly requesting<br />\nhis men to come out. He has been taking<br />\na hand at quarter, and will probably play<br />\nthere. This will necessitate some changes in<br />\n1908's back-field. Just who will play in the<br />\nback-field, is, of course, very uncertain, and<br />\nwill not be definitely decided until the day of<br />\nthe class game. The Junior class is rather<br />\nhandicapped for lack of good line material,<br />\nsince there are few men in that class who<br />\nhave played on the line before.<br />\nSo far 1908 has played one game\u2014that<br />\nagainst City College, which was lost by the<br />\nscore of 17-0. In this game the Junior backs<br />\ncarried the ball fairly well, but the whole<br />\nwas wofully lacking when it came to defensive<br />\nwork. Several interesting arguments occurred<br />\nin the game, which resulted in Silkman of<br />\nB. C. C., and Breyer and Wegefarth of the<br />\nJuniors being sent to the side-lines. Abel<br />\nmade a very brilliant run of fifty yards, almost<br />\nmaking a touch-down.<br />\nThe Freshmen have certainly not been<br />\nhandicapped for lack of men, for they seem<br />\nto have had a large squad out. They have<br />\nplayed two games, the first one with Marston's, and the second with Dunham's. The<br />\nfirst game only lasted one half and was played<br />\non a field covered with mud. The Freshmen<br />\nwon by a score of 11-5. The game with Dunham's resulted in a defeat for 1909 by the<br />\nscore of 5-0. In this game the Freshmen did<br />\nmuch better than in the previous one, and<br />\ncame very near winning. Taking it all in all,<br />\nthe class game this year should be very close<br />\nand very interesting and the result is likely to<br />\nbe in doubt until the referee's whistle blows<br />\nfor the last time.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 10-B. M. C., 0.<br />\nThe team has won at last, and the victory<br />\nwas well earned. Some around the University<br />\nwere very doubtful about the outcome of the<br />\n<br />\ngame, and, as a result, a number of them<br />\nstayed away, saying that they did not care to<br />\ngo out and see the team lose. As a matter of<br />\nfact, their predictions fell flat, for the team<br />\nwon in a hard-played game by the score of 10<br />\nto 0. And Baltimore Medical College was by<br />\nno means an easy team. They outweighed our<br />\nfellows to some extent, and they had several<br />\ngood individual players, notably Wiggin, who<br />\nplayed right-half.<br />\nThe field was a little slippery, so that some<br />\nof the plays were not run off as fast as they<br />\nmight have been, but on the whole, the play<br />\nwas good. The first half was anybody's game,<br />\nwith the ball in Hopkins' territory. Here it<br />\nwas that B. M. C. played best, making several<br />\ngood end runs, and once or twice threatened<br />\nto kick a goal from field, but were blocked by<br />\nthe Hopkins' linemen breaking through. Unfortunately for B. M. C., their kicking staff<br />\nwas poor\u2014for the punts were bad and the<br />\nattempted drop-kicks failed.<br />\nAs usual, J. H. U. played better ball in the<br />\nsecond half, and by straight line bucking<br />\nfinally pushed Webb over for the first touchdown. The ground was gained principally by<br />\noff-tackle plays, varied occasionally by short<br />\nend runs. The second touchdown came near<br />\nthe close of the game, and was the result of a<br />\npretty run by Stewart. The play was right<br />\noff tackle, but Stewart managed to get clear,<br />\nand, dodging the quarter-back, planted the<br />\nball between the posts.<br />\nThe defensive work of the team was much<br />\nbetter, on the whole, than that displayed in<br />\nthe Haverford game, but the team must not<br />\nget swelled heads, or become over confident<br />\nabout the St. John's game.

Then we<br />\nwould have some rooting worth while.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHAVERFORD, 23-HOPKINS, 0.<br />\nThere is little to say about the game between Haverford and our fellows, and what<br />\nthere is to say, has little pleasure for all Hopkins men. The team went up to Haverford<br />\nwith high hopes of winning, after the way<br />\nthey played against Swarthmore, but the way<br />\nHaverford played was a revelation, and the<br />\noutcome of the game was a bitter disappointment to rooters and players alike.<br />\nThe loss of the game can be attributed to<br />\nlack of training more than anything else.<br />\nHaverford started off with a rush, making<br />\nseveral long end runs at the start, and completely winded the Hopkins team right away.<br />\nIt was the old story of a fast, well-trained<br />\neleven against a heavy, but very poorly-trained<br />\nteam, and, as a result, there could be but one<br />\nending.<br />\nThe conditions were ideal for football\u2014a<br />\nleaden sky, cold air, and a hard field, just<br />\nwhat was needed to put snap and vim into a<br />\nteam, but Haverford seemed to get all the<br />\nsnap and vim. In a very short time after the<br />\nkick-off, they had scored their first touchdown, mainly by end runs. Shortly after they<br />\nscored their second touchdown. Here it was<br />\nthat Hopkins seemed to take a brace, for<br />\nHaverford was held on our twenty-yard line<br />\nand was forced to try for a goal from placement, which barely crossed the bar. This<br />\nmade the score 15-0, after which the first half<br />\nwas ended.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins took a slight<br />\nbrace, but by that time, it was too late, for<br />\nher men were completely fagged out, and<br />\nwere unable to advance the ball. Only long<br />\npunts by Michael kept the warriors in red and<br />\nblack from getting closer to the Baltimore<br />\nboys' goal. As it was, Haverford made a<br />\nthird touchdown, and also a safety, running<br />\nthe score up to 23-0.<br />\nThe whole team was far below its standard,<br />\nand played worse than in any game so far this<br />\nseason, Not only were the men out of condition, but they seemed to lack spirit. A<br />\ndecided brace must be taken, if St. John's<br />\nis to be beaten. The Hopkins team does not,<br />\nas yet, know what it is to cross the goal line<br />\nof her opponents, and must play a much<br />\nbetter game if they want to win from the<br />\nAnnapolis team.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD HO!<br />\nHomewood is a word that is now on every<br />\none's tongue. There are some few who take<br />\nit seriously, but the majority of the students<br />\nand even of the faculty take it as a huge joke.<br />\nNow here is just where the trouble lies. If<br />\neveryone, both professors and students, would<br />\nbe anxious and would strive earnestly to get<br />\nto Homewood, it could be done very quickly.<br />\nWhen you ask anyone if he is anxious to get<br />\nto Homewood he says yes immediately; but<br />\nwhen you ask him to contribute even a little,<br />\nhe laughs at you, and says that it is impossible to raise enough money for the University<br />\nto move. Nothing is impossible. Where<br />\nthere is a will, there is a way. A million<br />\ndollar endowment fund was raised; why can<br />\nnot another million dollars be raised for the<br />\npurpose of moving to Homewood? If every<br />\nstudent would contribute to the Student Fund<br />\nas much as each one could afford, we should<br />\nhave a fair start; and a thing once begun is<br />\nhalf done. The president should appeal to<br />\nthe alumni of this city, and I am sure he<br />\nwould receive liberal contributions. Then<br />\nthere are the Johns Hopkins Alumni Associations of other cities, which could easily raise<br />\nseveral thousand dollars. The trouble is that<br />\nthe University is asleep and expects to wake<br />\nup some day to find that all the buildings<br />\nhave been erected at Homewood. The days<br />\nof fairy stories are over; and if you want anything now-a-days, it is necessary to work<br />\nhard for it. Why do not the wives of the professors take enough interest in the University<br />\nto get up some entertainments or fairs for the<br />\nbuilding fund? Churches make thousands of<br />\ndollars in this way, and so could the University. Again these ideas are hooted at; but<br />\nthey would do good, for when people see that<br />\nthe University is helping itself, they would<br />\ngladly give assistance. We can not expect<br />\nto get enongh money immediately or even in<br />\none year, but it would not take more than two<br />\nyears. If such action had been taken when<br />\nwe first received the property, we should now<br />\nbe near to occupying that most beautiful tract.<br />\nVery few people realize what a grand site<br />\nHomewood is. We may venture to say that<br />\nwhen the Universty becomes settled at Homewood\u2014and we trust that it shall be within a<br />\nfew years\u2014it will be one of the most beautitiful colleges in the country.

Although the column has been open in but<br />\n,<br />\n11<br />\none issue of the paper, the sum of $15 has already been realized, and,<br />\nwhile the contributions have not yet become general in character, it is<br />\n* 4expected<br />\nthat before the next issue of the NEWS-LETTE,R the amount<br />\n*<br />\n********* \u2022<br />\nwill have at least doubled the present sum on hand. We do not wish it<br />\nto be supposed, that, because the three contributions thus far made<br />\namount to $5 each, we would not gladly and thankfully accept much<br />\nsmaller amounts, for, indeed, the original purpose of the idea was for the Fund to draw on<br />\nthe loose change, which the students might have from time to time in their pockets, and which<br />\ncould not be otherwise put to any economic use. It may be interesting to mention here that<br />\nthe New York Evening Post printed Saturday, November 10, a detailed outline of the purpose<br />\nof the Student Contribution Fund, calling attention to the fact that we hope, by means of the<br />\nFund, to erect or purchase some suitable memorial for one of the new buildings at Homewood,<br />\nwhich memorial will probably be a corner-stone for one of the buildings. To raise the required<br />\namount of money, it will doubtless be necessary to carry on the Fund for several years, or<br />\nuntil the present Freshman Class will have attained graduating honors.<br /><br />\nUROPE had her Martin Luther; America has had her Carrie Nation; and<br />\nnow from out the low-roofed recesses of the gymnasium locker room<br />\nconies an ever-swelling cry for a leader to head in a reform against certain<br />\nabuses there existing. Moved by the justice of the cry, the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\ngirding its loins with the apron of determination, and bearing aloft the<br />\nstaff of righteousness, has responded to the call, and taken up the cause<br />\nof the lovers of sanitation. Our slogan is \"Excelsior,\" and our motto<br />\n,41[441<br />\nis<br />\n\"New brushes and combs for the locker room.\" There's not to<br />\nE3<br />\nE3<br />\nreason<br />\nwhy, but someone has blundered. Can the responsible \"o<br />\n. ne give<br />\nst<br />\nsufficient cause and reason for the fact that one of the hair brushes is<br />\nwithout a handle? If so, let him show reason why the devasting germs of baldness have been<br />\nallowed to pluck all but a few of the bristles from the other brush, until, alas! it is late, too<br />\nlate, for even Hermicide. Let him justify the fact that for some time our sturdy athletes<br />\nhave been obliged to affect their coiffures by means of combs (?), whose toothless gums give<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\na mocking lie to usefulness. BUT THAT IS NOT ALL! If, indeed, we must use bristleless brushes and toothless gum, why can't they be kept at least clean, and not in the repulsive<br />\ncondition now characteristic of them? We do not know who is the one responsible for the<br />\ntonsorial equipment of the locker room, but whoever he is, let him hear otxr appeal. And,<br />\nfurther, let him have a few inches of the dust, now stratified on the benches in the gallery of<br />\nthe cage, removed to the geological laboratory in order that seating space might be given those<br />\nstudents who would like to watch the team practices from the gallery.<br /><br />\nOW that the year is well started, it is possible to\u2022 see some of the results<br />\nof the four years' course\u2014at least as far as it affects the number of men<br />\nin the University. We are somewhat sorry to note that, despite the fact<br />\nthat two classes were supposed to enter this fall, there are only about<br />\n60 new men, and of the strictly four-year men, only about 30.<br />\nProbably if the men entering in the future will be limited strictly to the<br />\nfour-years' course, the size of the undergraduate body may eventually<br />\nincrease to about 200 from the present 160. But, if, as may be seen<br />\nfrom the catalogue, various loopholes are to be left open by which all those,<br />\nwho are more disposed to study than anything else, may squeeze themselves through in three years, the number of undergraduates will probably not increase. The<br />\nsmall size of the Undergraduate Department has always, we believe, been disadvantageous to<br />\nthe University. A strong mind dwells only in a healthy body; our Post-graduate Department<br />\nneeds a large body of collegiates to support it and furnish it material.<br />\nVERY day draws nearer to the time when the classes will have their banquets. The Freshman Banquet is looked forward to by all, both concerned and otherwise. Every year the Freshman Banquet stirs tip the<br />\nFreshmen into nervous excitement for at least two weeks ahead of the<br />\ndate, and the Juniors spend much of their not very valuable time in<br />\nspying and scouting. This was the case last year. The theory is of<br />\ncourse that the Freshmen have no right to a banquet, any more than a<br />\nfive-year old has to high-balls and cigarettes. We do not care to bring<br />\nup this weighty question; but the point is that the Freshman Banquet,<br />\nas now held, seriously interrupts the work of the University. Of<br />\ncourse, it is easy enough to suggest that either the Freshmen shall not give their banquet until<br />\narriving at the age of discretion or else the Juniors shall not interfere. It requires no experiment to see that neither of these expedients would work successfully.<br />\nPerhaps a compromise can be effected.

The real ground of most opposition to<br />\nthe simpler forms is merely that they are<br />\nunfamiliar; yet few are thoughtful enough to<br />\nrecognize this or frank enough to admit it.<br />\nSome of the popular objections to them are<br />\nbased upon curiously false notions.<br />\nWhat may be called the Roosevelt fallacy is<br />\none of the most interesting of these notions.<br />\nIn the late midsummer, when journalists<br />\nlanguisht for something to make a sensation<br />\nout of, President Roosevelt directed the Public<br />\nPrinter to adopt the three hundred simpler<br />\nforms selected by the Board. The effect of<br />\nthis order was magical. Correspondents made<br />\ncopy of it by the yard; patriots who do not<br />\nread a government report once in ten years<br />\nprotested bitterly at the desecration of those<br />\ndocuments by revolutionary English; and an<br />\nEnglish journal remarked contemptuously that<br />\nthe reformed spelling might be good enough<br />\nfor a nation of yesterday, but would never do<br />\nfor a people blest with a tradition of a thousand years. The result was that, in the minds<br />\nof many persons, the responsibility of the<br />\nwhole reform was laid on the broad shoulders<br />\nof the President, and the Simplified Spelling<br />\nbecame the \"Roosevelt Spelling.\" Consegently there are those who do not like the<br />\nsimpler forms because they do not approve of<br />\nMr. Roosevelt, and are hardly to be persuaded<br />\nthat he is not at the bottom of the whole thing.<br />\nYet it is hard to see, apart from political<br />\nprejudice, why the government printing house<br />\nshould necessarily be the least up-to-date.<br />\nIndeed, since the official reports are all practical in purpose and quite out of the realm of<br />\npure literature, they are especially fitted for<br />\ntempting usage with desirable simplifications.<br />\nCertainly, nobody's esthetic sense can be<br />\nseriously offended by Mru in an agricultural<br />\nreport.<br />\nThe authorityfallacy is almost the converse<br />\nof the Roosevelt fallacy. \"What right has a<br />\nself-constituted board to dictate how I shall<br />\nspell?\" says an objector. \"We should have<br />\na cabinet officer to supervise language,\"<br /><br />\nurges another, \"or a representative convention called by the government to propose<br />\nreforms.\" Now, of course, the Simplified<br />\nSpelling Board makes no assumption of authority, tho the changes which it proposes are<br />\nbased upon the soundest scholarship. In the<br />\nrepublic of intellect there are no dictators;<br />\nanybody has a right to make a motion and to<br />\nget it carried if he can.<br />\nThe etymologicalfallacy is a great favorite<br />\nwith everybody except the etymologist. It is<br />\ndoubly fallacious, because the simplified<br />\nspellings do not, as a rule, obscure the history<br />\nof the words, and if they did, no great harm<br />\nwould result. Popular off-hand etymologizing<br />\nis less reliable than popular diagnosis of diseases. The untrained reader who wants to<br />\nknow the history of a word should consult all<br />\nthe good dictionaries within reach, and should<br />\nremember that even they are not infallible.<br />\nHe will know what a debt is long before he<br />\nlearns that the word is related to the Latin<br />\ndebitum. When he knows that, it will be a<br />\nshort step to the knowledge that the useless<br />\n\"b\" was rudely forced into the word as a<br />\nsign of its origin, a sign wholly false to its<br />\nhistory. The fact that doul, delite, sovran,<br />\nrime, agast and iland are etymological, and<br />\nthat the current spellings are the results of deliberate interference with their development,<br />\nmay serve as a starting point for wholesome<br />\ndistrust of the historical value of our present<br />\nspelling. If we spelled alms so as to show its<br />\norigin, the form should be eleemosyne.

In the first<br />\nplace, the game, as changed by the new rules,<br />\nmakes it imperative that a team have out-door<br />\npractice. The new trick plays absolutely<br />\nneed out-door practice to insure their success,<br />\nand out-door practice is an impossibility under<br />\nthe present system. If we had an undergraduate team, we could get out-door practice<br />\non Wednesday afternoons, at least, and even<br />\none afternoon would work wonderful results<br />\nin a team. As we rely upon the men from<br />\nthe Medical School to form the backbone of<br />\nthe team, we can not get any out-door practice<br />\nat all. Instead, we have to be content with<br />\npractices in the cage from 6 p. in. to 7 p. m.<br />\nThat means that the team must have supper<br />\nevery Monday, Wednesday and Friday night,<br />\nand this supper item is one of the largest<br />\nexpenses that the management has to put up<br />\nwith. With an undergraduate team, practices<br />\nwould start promptly at 5, and would stop at<br />\n6. The men would have ample time to get<br />\nhome for supper, and thus relieve the management of a heavy load.<br />\nAgain, an undergraduate team could be<br />\ngotten which would train hard. That was<br />\none of the faults of this year's team, for there<br />\nwas little or no training done. The men from<br />\nthe Medical School can not be blamed, for not<br />\ntraining; it is too much for us to expect it of<br />\nthem, but an undergraduate team could be<br />\nmade to train and to train hard. We get out<br />\nlacrosse and track teams that are willing to<br /><br />\nTHAT FATAL SMILE.<br />\nThere once lived a fellow named Dewey,<br />\nWho lived in the City St. Lewey,<br />\nWhen asked why he fed<br />\nOn oatmeal, he said:<br />\n\"Because I like things that are gewey.\"<br /><br />\ntrain, and there is no reason at all why we<br />\nshould not get out a football team which<br />\nwould be willing to train.<br />\nDissenters will say that the advantages<br />\nderived from out-door practice and training<br />\nwill not, by any means, measure up to the<br />\nadvantages of having men from the Medical<br />\nSchool who have played before and who know<br />\nthe game. As a matter of fact, owing to the<br />\nchanged style of play of football, the experienced men are not much better off than the<br />\nnew men, for they are compelled to unlearn<br />\nmany things before they can adapt themselves<br />\nto the new conditions.<br />\nThere is plenty of good football material<br />\namong the classes, which needs just a little<br />\ncoaching to turn into 'Varsity material.<br />\nDoubtless, the team would not be a worldbeater the first year or so, but as soon as an<br />\nefficient scrub is developed, we might look for<br />\nwinning teams. Under the present system<br />\nthere is practically no scrub at all, because<br />\nthe undergraduates will not come out at 6.30<br />\nand be kept out until 7.30, getting cold<br />\nsuppers at home. It stands to reason that<br />\nthe undergraduates will not come out and<br />\nscrub against a team in which they are not<br />\ninterested. But with an undergraduate team,<br />\nit is safe to predict that every practice will<br />\nsee a scrub team out, just as there is always a<br />\nscrub team for lacrosse and plenty of \"alsorans\" for track.<br />\nThere are, of course, reasons why we should<br />\nnot attempt a team next year based upon the<br />\nundergraduate students, but to the writer it<br />\nseems that the reasons in favor of a collegiate<br />\nteam outweigh the others. So let us see<br />\neveryone turn out to make a good representative team next year.<br /><br />\nALAN M.

So far,<br />\nthe Freshmen seem to have had the larger<br />\nsquad out, but the Juniors have not been<br />\nexactly napping. In fact, Captain Abel, of<br />\nthe Junior team is wearing a worried look<br />\nnow all the time, and is earnestly requesting<br />\nhis men to come out. He has been taking<br />\na hand at quarter, and will probably play<br />\nthere. This will necessitate some changes in<br />\n1908's back-field. Just who will play in the<br />\nback-field, is, of course, very uncertain, and<br />\nwill not be definitely decided until the day of<br />\nthe class game. The Junior class is rather<br />\nhandicapped for lack of good line material,<br />\nsince there are few men in that class who<br />\nhave played on the line before.<br />\nSo far 1908 has played one game\u2014that<br />\nagainst City College, which was lost by the<br />\nscore of 17-0. In this game the Junior backs<br />\ncarried the ball fairly well, but the whole<br />\nwas wofully lacking when it came to defensive<br />\nwork. Several interesting arguments occurred<br />\nin the game, which resulted in Silkman of<br />\nB. C. C., and Breyer and Wegefarth of the<br />\nJuniors being sent to the side-lines. Abel<br />\nmade a very brilliant run of fifty yards, almost<br />\nmaking a touch-down.<br />\nThe Freshmen have certainly not been<br />\nhandicapped for lack of men, for they seem<br />\nto have had a large squad out. They have<br />\nplayed two games, the first one with Marston's, and the second with Dunham's. The<br />\nfirst game only lasted one half and was played<br />\non a field covered with mud. The Freshmen<br />\nwon by a score of 11-5. The game with Dunham's resulted in a defeat for 1909 by the<br />\nscore of 5-0. In this game the Freshmen did<br />\nmuch better than in the previous one, and<br />\ncame very near winning. Taking it all in all,<br />\nthe class game this year should be very close<br />\nand very interesting and the result is likely to<br />\nbe in doubt until the referee's whistle blows<br />\nfor the last time.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 10-B. M. C., 0.<br />\nThe team has won at last, and the victory<br />\nwas well earned. Some around the University<br />\nwere very doubtful about the outcome of the<br /><br />\ngame, and, as a result, a number of them<br />\nstayed away, saying that they did not care to<br />\ngo out and see the team lose. As a matter of<br />\nfact, their predictions fell flat, for the team<br />\nwon in a hard-played game by the score of 10<br />\nto 0. And Baltimore Medical College was by<br />\nno means an easy team. They outweighed our<br />\nfellows to some extent, and they had several<br />\ngood individual players, notably Wiggin, who<br />\nplayed right-half.<br />\nThe field was a little slippery, so that some<br />\nof the plays were not run off as fast as they<br />\nmight have been, but on the whole, the play<br />\nwas good. The first half was anybody's game,<br />\nwith the ball in Hopkins' territory. Here it<br />\nwas that B. M. C. played best, making several<br />\ngood end runs, and once or twice threatened<br />\nto kick a goal from field, but were blocked by<br />\nthe Hopkins' linemen breaking through. Unfortunately for B. M. C., their kicking staff<br />\nwas poor\u2014for the punts were bad and the<br />\nattempted drop-kicks failed.<br />\nAs usual, J. H. U. played better ball in the<br />\nsecond half, and by straight line bucking<br />\nfinally pushed Webb over for the first touchdown. The ground was gained principally by<br />\noff-tackle plays, varied occasionally by short<br />\nend runs. The second touchdown came near<br />\nthe close of the game, and was the result of a<br />\npretty run by Stewart. The play was right<br />\noff tackle, but Stewart managed to get clear,<br />\nand, dodging the quarter-back, planted the<br />\nball between the posts.<br />\nThe defensive work of the team was much<br />\nbetter, on the whole, than that displayed in<br />\nthe Haverford game, but the team must not<br />\nget swelled heads, or become over confident<br />\nabout the St. John's game. St. John's will<br />\nput up their strongest game against Hopkins,<br />\nand they may be depended upon to play for<br />\nblood. They will give all they have, and J.<br />\nH. U. must be prepared to do the same.<br />\nAll three backs carried the ball well on Saturday, and could be depended upon to gain.<br />\nHart was so unfortunate as to sustain a bad<br />\ncut over his eye, but we hope that this will not<br />\ninterfere with his playing next Saturday.<br />\nRidgely got in some very effective tackling at<br />\nright end, as did Michael at left tackle. Captain Preble got in the game in the second half,<br />\nand inspired confidence by his presence.<br />\nOnly two more games remain to be played\u2014<br />\nSt. John's at Annapolis, and University of<br />\nMaryland at Oriole Park on Thanksgiving<br />\nafternoon. Rooters! Brace up! Why shouldn't<br />\nevery rooter supply himself with a small megaphone such as the Navy uses? Then we<br />\nwould have some rooting worth while.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nHAVERFORD, 23-HOPKINS, 0.<br />\nThere is little to say about the game between Haverford and our fellows, and what<br />\nthere is to say, has little pleasure for all Hopkins men. The team went up to Haverford<br />\nwith high hopes of winning, after the way<br />\nthey played against Swarthmore, but the way<br />\nHaverford played was a revelation, and the<br />\noutcome of the game was a bitter disappointment to rooters and players alike.<br />\nThe loss of the game can be attributed to<br />\nlack of training more than anything else.<br />\nHaverford started off with a rush, making<br />\nseveral long end runs at the start, and completely winded the Hopkins team right away.<br />\nIt was the old story of a fast, well-trained<br />\neleven against a heavy, but very poorly-trained<br />\nteam, and, as a result, there could be but one<br />\nending.<br />\nThe conditions were ideal for football\u2014a<br />\nleaden sky, cold air, and a hard field, just<br />\nwhat was needed to put snap and vim into a<br />\nteam, but Haverford seemed to get all the<br />\nsnap and vim. In a very short time after the<br />\nkick-off, they had scored their first touchdown, mainly by end runs. Shortly after they<br />\nscored their second touchdown. Here it was<br />\nthat Hopkins seemed to take a brace, for<br />\nHaverford was held on our twenty-yard line<br />\nand was forced to try for a goal from placement, which barely crossed the bar. This<br />\nmade the score 15-0, after which the first half<br />\nwas ended.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins took a slight<br />\nbrace, but by that time, it was too late, for<br />\nher men were completely fagged out, and<br />\nwere unable to advance the ball. Only long<br />\npunts by Michael kept the warriors in red and<br />\nblack from getting closer to the Baltimore<br />\nboys' goal. As it was, Haverford made a<br />\nthird touchdown, and also a safety, running<br />\nthe score up to 23-0.<br />\nThe whole team was far below its standard,<br />\nand played worse than in any game so far this<br />\nseason, Not only were the men out of condition, but they seemed to lack spirit. A<br />\ndecided brace must be taken, if St. John's<br />\nis to be beaten. The Hopkins team does not,<br />\nas yet, know what it is to cross the goal line<br />\nof her opponents, and must play a much<br />\nbetter game if they want to win from the<br />\nAnnapolis team.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD HO!<br />\nHomewood is a word that is now on every<br />\none's tongue. There are some few who take<br />\nit seriously, but the majority of the students<br />\nand even of the faculty take it as a huge joke.<br />\nNow here is just where the trouble lies. If<br />\neveryone, both professors and students, would<br />\nbe anxious and would strive earnestly to get<br />\nto Homewood, it could be done very quickly.<br />\nWhen you ask anyone if he is anxious to get<br />\nto Homewood he says yes immediately; but<br />\nwhen you ask him to contribute even a little,<br />\nhe laughs at you, and says that it is impossible to raise enough money for the University<br />\nto move. Nothing is impossible. Where<br />\nthere is a will, there is a way. A million<br />\ndollar endowment fund was raised; why can<br />\nnot another million dollars be raised for the<br />\npurpose of moving to Homewood? If every<br />\nstudent would contribute to the Student Fund<br />\nas much as each one could afford, we should<br />\nhave a fair start; and a thing once begun is<br />\nhalf done. The president should appeal to<br />\nthe alumni of this city, and I am sure he<br />\nwould receive liberal contributions. Then<br />\nthere are the Johns Hopkins Alumni Associations of other cities, which could easily raise<br />\nseveral thousand dollars. The trouble is that<br />\nthe University is asleep and expects to wake<br />\nup some day to find that all the buildings<br />\nhave been erected at Homewood. The days<br />\nof fairy stories are over; and if you want anything now-a-days, it is necessary to work<br />\nhard for it. Why do not the wives of the professors take enough interest in the University<br />\nto get up some entertainments or fairs for the<br />\nbuilding fund? Churches make thousands of<br />\ndollars in this way, and so could the University. Again these ideas are hooted at; but<br />\nthey would do good, for when people see that<br />\nthe University is helping itself, they would<br />\ngladly give assistance. We can not expect<br />\nto get enongh money immediately or even in<br />\none year, but it would not take more than two<br />\nyears. If such action had been taken when<br />\nwe first received the property, we should now<br />\nbe near to occupying that most beautiful tract.<br />\nVery few people realize what a grand site<br />\nHomewood is. We may venture to say that<br />\nwhen the Universty becomes settled at Homewood\u2014and we trust that it shall be within a<br />\nfew years\u2014it will be one of the most beautitiful colleges in the country. The place is<br />\nideal for a university.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nSTUDENT PUBLICATIONS.<br /><br />\nALUMNI NOTES.<br /><br />\nIf we look over the college papers of our<br />\n'06.
