The prestidigitator himself<br />\nIs not able to shed much light on<br />\nthe problem. Under the New Plan,<br />\n<br />\nhe is a candidate for a degree,<br />\nwhich he hopes will be an M.A. in<br />\npolitical science, and which he<br />\nhopes to get this coming June,<br />\nat the end of four years at JHU.<br />\nIn his years at Hopkins, Gene<br />\nhas been one of those for whom<br />\nthe New Plan face lifting has been<br />\nof much significance, and he &inks<br />\nthe type of student life of which<br />\nhe has been a part will have to<br />\nchange also.<br />\nHowever, while a patronizer.of<br />\nBach concerts, he quickly assures<br />\n<br />\nBETRAYAL OF A TRUST<br />\n<br />\ndip<br />\n<br />\nAfter last week 's conference at Homewood House with<br />\nrepresentatives of the DSRC, Dean G. Wilson Shaffer announced<br />\nthat his office would give its unrestrained sanction to the ejection<br />\nof any group or individual from the dormitory whose conduct was<br />\ncontrary to The standards set up by the residence hall's governing<br />\nbody.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDean Shaffer's statement is the culmination of evenfs'which<br />\nhave disturbed the usual scholarly attitude of the dorm since the<br />\nfirst of the year. The trouble has arisen primarily from an<br />\nunruly element of the freshman class, although a small number<br />\nof upperclassmen have also taken part. This freshman clique has<br />\ndemonstrated an apparent disregard for the dorm's regulatims<br />\nand has flaunted the demands of the DSRC.<br />\nOne disturbing facet of this disregard of authority is that<br />\nsome of the supposed leaders of the freshman class are included<br />\nin this clique.<br />\nThe policy- of this university has traditionally been one of<br />\nmature rules for supposedly mature individuals. Occasionally, as<br />\nin this instance, these regulations are infringed 'upon by small<br />\ngroups of immature underclassmen. An investigation of the<br />\nconditions under which students live in the residence halls of<br />\nmany other universities leaves little doubt the superiority of the<br />\nHopkins system. Yet this freshman clique has repeatedly betrayed<br />\nthis gift, this trust under which they hope to call themselves<br />\nHopkins men.<br />\nTheir actions show not only a juvenile conception of the<br />\nHopkins system but a lack of respect and consideration for<br />\nthe 300 other students in the dorm. We find it hard to brand any<br />\nHopkins student as immatue, but under these'circumstances we<br />\nare left with no alternative. This immaturity of behavior must<br />\nbe corrected for the protection of those who recognize and pride<br />\nthemselves in the system under which we receive our education. If<br />\nconstructive criticism fails, drastic action must be taken; that<br />\naction, under our system, should, and does come from the student<br />\nbody. In this case the elected representatives of the dormitory<br />\nstudents have decided to place an ultimatum before the offenders<br />\n\u2014conform or get out. This edict now has the backing of the Dean's<br />\noffice\u2014it is no idle threat.<br />\nWe feel that not only the best interests of the dorm but of<br />\nthe university as well would be compromised if this attitude\u2014this<br />\ncorruption of the traditional laissez-faire system were not corrected.

Between 1942 and<br />\n1950 the Jays lost the MasonDixon title only once, but last<br />\nyear they were unable to win a<br />\nmatch in seven tries.<br />\nPoor Turnout<br />\nThis year the turnout for the<br />\nsquad was one of the, poorest in<br />\nthe history of the team and at<br />\npresent there are but eleven active<br />\nmen on the roster.<br />\nSince there are eight weight<br />\nclasses, it leaves the team in very<br />\npoor shape to practice. In fact at<br />\nthe present moment Coach Carl<br />\nRees is not even sure if he will<br />\nhave a man in the 137 pound class.<br />\nThis turnout, combined with the<br />\n<br />\nfact that practice sessions have<br />\nhad an average attendance of<br />\nabout three members, prompted<br />\nTurner to call a meeting of the<br />\nteam with the purpose of disbanding it unless more interest<br />\nwas shown.<br />\nAfter a two hour discussion,<br />\nhowever, it was decided to let the<br />\nfate of the team ride on the outcome of the Virginia meet. If this<br />\nmeet shows that there is a definite<br />\ninterest in wrestling, the sport<br />\nwill be continued.<br />\nThe team appears to have a<br />\ngood nucleus at present.

The prestidigitator himself<br />\nIs not able to shed much light on<br />\nthe problem. Under the New Plan,<br /><br />\nhe is a candidate for a degree,<br />\nwhich he hopes will be an M.A. in<br />\npolitical science, and which he<br />\nhopes to get this coming June,<br />\nat the end of four years at JHU.<br />\nIn his years at Hopkins, Gene<br />\nhas been one of those for whom<br />\nthe New Plan face lifting has been<br />\nof much significance, and he &amp;inks<br />\nthe type of student life of which<br />\nhe has been a part will have to<br />\nchange also.<br />\nHowever, while a patronizer.of<br />\nBach concerts, he quickly assures<br /><br />\nBETRAYAL OF A TRUST<br /><br />\ndip<br /><br />\nAfter last week 's conference at Homewood House with<br />\nrepresentatives of the DSRC, Dean G. Wilson Shaffer announced<br />\nthat his office would give its unrestrained sanction to the ejection<br />\nof any group or individual from the dormitory whose conduct was<br />\ncontrary to The standards set up by the residence hall's governing<br />\nbody.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDean Shaffer's statement is the culmination of evenfs'which<br />\nhave disturbed the usual scholarly attitude of the dorm since the<br />\nfirst of the year. The trouble has arisen primarily from an<br />\nunruly element of the freshman class, although a small number<br />\nof upperclassmen have also taken part. This freshman clique has<br />\ndemonstrated an apparent disregard for the dorm's regulatims<br />\nand has flaunted the demands of the DSRC.<br />\nOne disturbing facet of this disregard of authority is that<br />\nsome of the supposed leaders of the freshman class are included<br />\nin this clique.<br />\nThe policy- of this university has traditionally been one of<br />\nmature rules for supposedly mature individuals. Occasionally, as<br />\nin this instance, these regulations are infringed 'upon by small<br />\ngroups of immature underclassmen. An investigation of the<br />\nconditions under which students live in the residence halls of<br />\nmany other universities leaves little doubt the superiority of the<br />\nHopkins system. Yet this freshman clique has repeatedly betrayed<br />\nthis gift, this trust under which they hope to call themselves<br />\nHopkins men.<br />\nTheir actions show not only a juvenile conception of the<br />\nHopkins system but a lack of respect and consideration for<br />\nthe 300 other students in the dorm. We find it hard to brand any<br />\nHopkins student as immatue, but under these'circumstances we<br />\nare left with no alternative. This immaturity of behavior must<br />\nbe corrected for the protection of those who recognize and pride<br />\nthemselves in the system under which we receive our education. If<br />\nconstructive criticism fails, drastic action must be taken; that<br />\naction, under our system, should, and does come from the student<br />\nbody. In this case the elected representatives of the dormitory<br />\nstudents have decided to place an ultimatum before the offenders<br />\n\u2014conform or get out. This edict now has the backing of the Dean's<br />\noffice\u2014it is no idle threat.<br />\nWe feel that not only the best interests of the dorm but of<br />\nthe university as well would be compromised if this attitude\u2014this<br />\ncorruption of the traditional laissez-faire system were not corrected.
