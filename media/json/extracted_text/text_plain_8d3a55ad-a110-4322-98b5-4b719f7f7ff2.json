On<br />\nseveral recent occasions these exercises have been marked by announcements<br />\nof such importance as to excite interest wherever men are who concern themselves with the progress of American education. First came the University's \u2022<br />\napplication for aid from the State of Maryland; then various statements concerning the movements set going to restore her to the stabler position of the<br />\nfore-time, movements gradually centering in that final one by which the endowment fund of $1,000,000 was completed last summer, and last of all, the opening<br />\nof \"The Promised Land\" on upper Charles street. The optimists who<br />\nexpected President Remsen to acknowledge the gift of funds ample to cover the<br />\nHomewood acres with stately buildings in which the great fame of Hopkins<br />\nshall grow greater, as a proper culmination to the double quick of earlier events,<br />\nwere not fully gratified. President Remsen's own remarks indicated that he<br />\nhimself knew of many such.<br />\n\"A gentleman stopped me on .the street the other day and declared he<br />\nwould^be sorely disappointed unless I announced that we have enough money<br />\nin hand to build at. Homewood,\" he said. \"I could only smile then, and I can<br />\ndo nothing better now.\"<br />\n\"If you ask,'what, then are you going to do with Homewood?' I should<br />\nreply, that we shall for the present study it\u2014learn how it will best serve our<br />\nPurpose, and none but the ,best advice will suit us. You know already that<br />\nthe president of our Board, Mr. R. Brent Keyser, has provided funds to enable<br />\nus to secure expert advice. I may also tell you that the trustees, as many as<br />\ncan leave, will go this spring upon a tour of observation to learn what other<br />\nuniversities can teach us for the development of the Homewood land. They<br />\nwill visit Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, Virginia and other<br />\nplaces, too, perhaps.\"<br />\nThe memory of Henry A. Rowland, whose researches in physics, contributing a great measure to the renown of Johns Hopkins, will endure of their<br />\nown merit, is assured of fuller perpetuation in the University itself by a gift \u2022<br />\nannounced at the exercises. A student of the late Professor Rowland has<br />\noffered to buy a complete library covering the field of spectroscopy, which was<br />\n..<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\none of the special branches of science which Dr. Rowland cultivated for many<br />\nyears with great success. \"The Rowland Memorial Library of Spectroscopy\"<br />\nwill he the name of the new collection, and Mrs. Rowland has contributed to it<br />\nall of the Professor's own books on that subject.<br />\nBy the gift of $25,000 from Dr. and Mrs. Christian H. Herter, of New York,<br />\nthe University will be able to invite some eminent professor of that branch of<br />\nscience to lecture in Baltimore each year hereafter.<br />\nThe commemoration exercises were those which are generally familiar to<br />\nall who have ever been students at Johns Hopkins. The Academic procession,<br />\nthis year under the Chief Marshalship of Dr. Harry L Wilson, entered the<br />\nauditorium to a march rendered by an orchestra under the direction of Prof. W.<br />\nEdward Heimendahl of the Peabody Conservatory. President Remsen headed<br />\nthe line in company with the orator of the day, President Edwin A. Alderman,<br />\nof Tulane University, President Emeritus D. C. Gilman following with the<br />\nchaplain, Dr. Arthur Chilton Powell. The guests and several academic bodies<br />\ncoming after in the usual order.<br />\nThe President, the President Emeritus, and the Orator, occupied the center<br />\nof the stage, Dr. Remsen seated in the President Chair presented two years ago<br />\nby the Harvard Club of Maryland.<br />\nIn introducing the speaker of the day, President Remsen said: \"A year<br />\nago a company in Music Hall, at a banquet memorable in the annals of Johns<br />\nHopkins, weary, perhaps, with the lapse of hours, suddenly woke up. It was<br />\nnear midnight, but an electric shock had passed\u2014a speech generated it. It<br />\ncould not last long, however, because the next day was Sunday. When we<br />\ncame to prepare for this occasion it occurred to us that we could do no better<br />\nthan invite the man who made that speech a year ago to continue it here this<br />\nmorning. It gives me great pleasure, accordingly, to present to you President<br />\nAlderman of Tulane University, New Orleans\"<br />\nPresident Alderman's address was devoted for the most part to a retrospective and prospective view of the South. In the most glowing manner he<br />\nspoke of the splendid and noble attributes of the old South, not, however,<br />\nneglecting to acknowledge those defects and vices which have disappeared<br />\nbefore the forces of modern civilization. Referring to the present time, Dr.<br />\nAlderman told of the great change that has now progressed so far, the passing<br />\nof the traditional and agricultural South into the active, modern industrial community. Believing that the South has before it a great future, along with the<br />\nrest of the nation, President Alderman feels that the great need of the South is<br />\nthe placing of its educational system upon an equal footing with that which<br />\nexists in the most advanced and prosperous parts of the land.<br />\nThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy was conferred upon Mr. Frederick<br />\nHutton Getman, University of Virginia; Mr. Benjamin Leroy Miller, A. B.,<br />\nUniversity of Kansas, 1897; Mr. Henry Nevi11 Sanders, A. B., Trinity University, Toronto, 1894, and Mr. Daniel Naylor Shoemaker, S. B., Earlham College, 1895.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nAs previously noted in THrt NEWS-LETTER, Dr. Getman will enter next<br />\nSeptember upon a physical chemical investigation under a recent grant from<br />\nthe Carnegie Institute.<br />\nThe growing interest in the exercises caused such a demand for tickets that<br />\nmany persons were unable to obtain them and even a number of those holding<br />\ntickets were unable to gain admittance into the assembly room. Referring to<br />\nthe necessity of having a larger auditorium in which to hold the Commemo<br />\nration Day exercises, Dr. Remsen said: \"I do not know whether or not this<br />\nhall will serve us another year for our present purposes. There are too many<br />\nin it at this moment; but notwithstanding this we have been obliged to turn<br />\naway a great many of those we should like to see here. This could not be<br />\navoided, but we will try to devise means by which we may have all our friends<br />\nwith us on future occasions of this sort.\"<br />\n<br />\nTHE ALUMNI BANQUET.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nH E annual banquet of the Alumni Association held at the Carrollton Hotel<br />\non the night of the 23rd, made a fitting close for the day's celebration.<br />\nAt a short business meeting before the banquet, the gentlemen who had<br />\nbeen nominated by the Executive Committee, as announced in the last issue of<br />\nthe \u201cliftws-LETTHR,\" were elected to hold office for the ensuing year. The<br />\ncompany then proceeded to the banquet hall, where an excellent dinner was<br />\nthoroughly enjoyed. At the conclusion, toast-master Dr. W. T. Sedgwick, the<br />\nretiring president of the association, made a short address of welcome to the<br />\nAlumni, in which he dwelt strongly on the national character of the University,<br />\nwhich he said was the pioneer in the work of nationalizing the educational field<br />\nof the country. He also spoke of the vast amount of useful work which the<br />\nUniversity could do if only the requisite funds were provided. Those who responded to toasts were:\u2014<br />\nDr. Gilman. introduced as the \"Master of Johns Hopkins,\" who<br />\nspoke of the national influence exerted by the Univetsity, and mentioned many<br />\nof its graduates who have attained distinction in the various paths of life, es-,<br />\npecially in the province of higher education.<br />\nPresident Remsen, who emphasized the fact that the true purpose of a university was to train men for scientific investigation. He said that, as the de<br />\nmand for investigators in this country far exceeded the supply, he believed such<br />\ninstitutions as the Carnegie and Rockefellet Institutes to be detrimental; for<br />\nthey tend to draw away from the universities men fitted to train these investigators<br />\nDr. Alderman, who depicted the noble grander of the \"scholar-patriot.\"<br />\nMr. Theodore Marburg, who spoke on behalf of the trustees.<br />\nProfessor H.

U.; or box 398, Medical School of Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nECENTLY a great scare was given the men who make the barber shop their<br />\nofficial headquarters when not attending classes. Owing to an order<br />\nwhich emanated from some unknown source all the chairs were removed<br />\nfrom the room. Fortunately for those tired mortals who settle all the great<br />\nquestions of the day, while seated in the chairs which have been provided for<br />\nWalter's patrons, on the following day the chairs were returned, and the dove<br />\nof peace settled once more above the doorway. Had the chairs not been returned, although the NEWS.LETTER would have objected, yet it would have<br />\nbeen honest enough to acknowledge that there was wisdom in the order which<br />\nemanated from the aforesaid unseen source. We cannot deny that the barber<br />\nshop is most conducive to that most catching of college diseases\u2014loafing. We<br />\ncannot deny that as a result of the above mentioned disease the place at times<br />\ndoes not present the most tidy appearance. We cannot deny that at times the<br />\natmosphere is dense with .the smoke of the vile weed. We cannot deny that<br />\nWalter some times gets so interested in a story or a colloquy that he inadvertently chips off a corner of the face of some trusting, unwary patron. In all<br />\nthis there is danger. But on the other hand there is one thing which, to our<br />\nmind, overbalances these drawbacks and turns the scales in favor of providing<br />\nseats for those men who prefer idleness to industry, and the freedom of a barber<br />\nshop debate to the august solemnness of the house or the senate. It is this<br />\n<br />\ng<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nCollege life at best is but for a shOrt season. Soon the men who now are engaged<br />\nin looking at life from what we may call a theoretical view point will be looking<br />\nat the same problem from its practical side, and in mmory they will live over<br />\nagain their college days They will not think of the days spent in the laboratory as much EIS they will of the days spent in chasing the pigskin over the<br />\nfield, they will not think of the dry lectures as much as the wet banquets, and<br />\nthey will not think of the papers they read in class as much as they will of the<br />\nhours stolen from study to spend in the midst of that bohemian organization<br />\nknown as the Fernandig Club. In a word, it is not the memory of the duh<br />\nfaithfully done which brings the same pleasure in after years as the mcmory of<br />\nthose moments of relaxation when we .pause in the harness to take breath before continuing the steady pull up the hill. We have no historic \"fence\" upon<br />\nwhich the upper classmen may perch, we have no historic steps upon which the<br />\nmen may sing college ballads, we have nothing but Walter's barbershop. So<br />\nlet us try and preserve that intact. And may every man, when his day comes<br />\nto leave, carry away with him no darker view of college life than that he obtains in Walter's tonsorial parlor!<br />\nN an article in the last issue of the NEWS\u2014LETTER under the heading of<br />\n\"Base Ball for 1903,\" it was stated that the \"statement may now be accepted as authoritative that Hopkins will have a base ball team this<br />\nseason.\" This was erroneous, and the NEWS LETTER regrets that it was given<br />\nto the public in a manner which seemed to vouch for the authenticity of the report. As long ago as the holidays the Athletic Board declared that there<br />\nwould be no representative team this season. It is true that a team composed<br />\nof Hopkins men will play during the season; but they have not the sanction ot<br />\nthe Athletic Board, nor are they at liberty to use Hopkins' name as has been<br />\ndone in several newspaper articles and in the last issue of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe base ball enthusiasts are in the main men from the Medical School, and if<br />\nthe team takes the field as an independent, self-supporting organization it might<br />\nwell be called the Johns Hopkins Medical School Base Ball Team, as at Yale<br />\nthere is a Yale Law School Base Ball Team. This would relieve the men from<br />\nbeing under the authority and discipline of the Athletic Association. Although<br />\nthe team will be composed of University men it must be understood that the<br />\nAthletic Association offers no guarantee for the fulfillment of their pledges<br />\n<br />\nj<br />\n<br />\nWING to the inclement weather the annual concert by the Musical Clubs<br />\nat Lehmann's Hall was not as largely attended as it would have been<br />\nunder more favorable conditions, But the management are well content<br />\nwith the financial result of the concert. From an artistic point of view the concert<br />\nwas a veritable triumph. The leaders showed excellent discrimination in their<br />\nselection of pieces,\u2022and the men sang and played with that hearty good will<br />\nwhich characterizes college men when they have an apprecia'ive audience.<br />\nThe Easter trip is not far distant, and the men are certain of an enthusiastic reception wherever they appear if they keep up to the high mark set by<br />\ntheir Baltimore performance.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nPROSPECTS FOR THE COMING DEBATE.<br />\nS the time draws nearer for the inter-class debate which will probably he<br />\nheld on March 2 1 st, interest on the part of those who are contesting for<br />\nthe various places on the teams is perceptibly increasing. Both Juniors<br />\nand Seniors are buckling down to work. and are sifting out all the material they<br />\ncan find on the subject of the debate. Practice is held every day under the<br />\ndirection of Dr. Lee and Mr. Burgess of the Baltimore School of Oratory, at<br />\nwhich times the echoes of McCoy Hall are rudely awakened by the impassioned<br />\neloquence of aspiring orators. Indeed, every indication seems to show that<br />\nboth sides will put up a stiff fight on the.night of the twenty-first.<br />\nThe cbntest has, however, narrowed down to six men on each side from<br />\nwhich the speakers and alternates of the two teams will be chosen.<br />\nFor the Seniors, these are Plaggemeyer, Blum, Strayer, Tootle, Addison,<br />\nGlocker.<br />\nFor the Juniors, they are Licking, Humrichouse, Foster, Rosenheim,<br />\nStollenwerck, Crozier.<br />\nIt has also been decided to have adviEers as in former years. The advisers<br />\nfor the Seniors will probably be Custis, Ammen, Parsons, and Hopper. Those<br />\nfor the Juniors wiil be chosen from Loyd, Emig, Geiger, Wallis, and Opie<br />\nThe Freshmen who will contest on the night of the debate for the medal<br />\noffered by Dr. Lee, will be selected from Strauglin, Boyce, Ziegler and Goldman.<br />\nAfter the inter-class contest, comes the debate with North Carolina. The<br />\nsouthern university has, so report says, put us down as one of their regular<br />\nannular scalps, but we want to disappoint them, and wipe out the defeat of<br />\nlast year by carrying victory into the heart of the Carolinas. To do this, every<br />\nman must come out and work. It is probable that the speakers who will represent Hopkins will be selected from the inter-class debating teams, but every<br />\nundergraduate is eligible, and, if he only makes manifest his latent ability, will<br />\nreceive due consideration. But those who do not possess the gift of eloquence<br />\nare not absolved. Valuable assistance can be rendered by a squad of enthusiastic workers who will help to write speeches,, run down material, and, above<br />\nall, criticise the arguments of the speakers, instead of waiting, as usual, for<br />\ndefeat to he announced before letting forth a stored.up flood of criticism.<br />\n<br />\nIIC<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE TAILOR PRIZES WON BY HOPKINS MEN.<br />\nHE February number of the College Tailor, which, we recall, is being Published by Lemmert, should be of especial interest to Hopkins men, not<br />\nonly because it is dedicated to the University of North Carolina with<br />\nwhom we have been on the most intimate terms, but because both the prize<br />\nstories therein were written by Hopkins men. In the first issue of the College<br />\nTailor, prizes were offered for the best football and hunting stories. These<br />\nwere captured by Mr. Walter B.

That the Baltimore public<br />\nappreciate a '`good thing\" when they see it was proved by the large audience which greeted them, and which enthusiastically applauded the various<br />\nselections.<br />\nThe concert hall was tastefully decorated with Southern smilax; the stage,<br />\nbanked with flowers and surmounted with the University motto in huge letters,<br />\nproduced a very pleasing effect. Placed at intervals on the walls were the different class flags, and the athletic banners,\u2014reminders of 'varsity successes.<br />\nThe large number of patronesses, outside friends of the University, as well<br />\nas the wives of the members of the faculty, contributed much to the success of<br />\nthe evening.<br />\nThe program opened with the University Ode. Then came some rollicking<br />\nsongs, and marches by the banjo and mandolin clubs. Selections by the quartette appeared twice on the program, and each time the members, T. H. Coffin,<br />\nF. J. Hall, F. R. Ford and P. K. Gilman. received a warm reception from the<br />\naudience. The Glee Club was greatly appreciated in the 1902 and 1903 medleys, arranged by W. B Carver.<br />\nThe selection \"Violets\" was particularly well rendered by the mandolin<br />\nclub, as was also the \"Baltimore Centennial,\" in which \"Dixie\" was played as<br />\na clarionet solo, while the mandolins and violins played \"Maryland. My Maryland.\" The program ended with a new Hopkins song. \"The Toast Song,\" of<br />\nwhich the words and music were composed by R. S. Lanier, our ex-editor-inchief.<br />\nThe Mandolin Club is deserving of much praise. It surpasses last year's<br />\nclub in volume and unity of tone, and the members show that they have been<br />\nwell trained under their leader, J. W. Bryan. The Glee Club, under the able<br />\nleadership of W. B. Carver, did very satisfactory work, and is to be commended. The Banjo Club, with C. A. Marshall as leader, was excellent. They<br />\nplayed with the same spirit and dash that characterized last year's club.<br />\nAltogether the concert was successful from every point of view. The management and players are to be congratulated on their efforts. Most encouraging of all is the fact that the concert was a financial success, insuring the clubs<br />\na<br />\ngood Easter trip.<br />\n<br />\nY. M. C. A NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nN Saturday evening, February 21, eight Hopkins men joined with about<br />\nfifty other men of Baltimore colleges in a Northfield supper at the invi \u2022<br />\ntation of the Baltimore Mt. Hermon Club. The Mt. Hermon Club is<br />\nthe organization of the alumni of Mr Moody's school, just across the river<br />\nfrom Northfield, Mass. The object of the gathering was to arouse interest in<br />\nthe summer student conference at Northfield next summer, June 26 to July 5.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nThis object tvas accomplished by six brief talks on the various sides of Northfield life and by much fun and reminiscing during the supper. There is always a strong feeling of friendship and enthusiasm among a party of men who<br />\nhave been to Northfield.<br />\nThe State convention for Delaware, Maryland and District of Columbia, in<br />\nBaltimore, March 6, 7 and 8, bids fair to be of interest to college men. The<br />\nSaturday sessions will be of special interest, and the afternoon, with possibly<br />\nthe morning session, will be held in Levering Hall. Mr. A. B. Williams, Jr.,<br />\nsecretary of college work of the east, will have charge of the student conference.<br />\nHe comes to us from a visit to the U. of P. and other institutions in the east,<br />\nand Hopkins should give him a good welcome. St. John's, Western Maryland<br />\nand other colleges expect to send large delegations. Hazlehurst, J. T. Smith,<br />\nJr., Sandrock, Hildt and Lloyd are a committee looking after the entertainment<br />\nof some of these men. It is desired that as many Hopkins men as possible<br />\nwill come to the Saturday afternoon session.<br />\nMr. Williams will remain a few days after the convention to meet the Hop \u2022<br />\nkins men here and at the Medical School, and will lead the meeting Tuesday,<br />\nMarch 10, at 5 o'clock. He is a Yale man of considerable experience in college<br />\nassociation work.<br />\nThe attendance at morning prayers has fallen off lately. It is hoped that<br />\nChristian men who have the nine o'clock period on will avail themselves of<br />\nG.<br />\nthis little opportunity for quiet worship.<br />\n<br />\nAMONG THE COLLEGES.<br />\nThe University of Michigan has 15,000 alumni, Harvard has 14,000 and<br />\nYale 11,436.<br />\nThe new gymnasium which is beitig built at Princeton will be the largest<br />\nbuilding of its kind in the world, the main floor being 100 by 166 feet.<br />\nThe Yale Football Association bid a surplus in the treasury this year of<br />\n$17,077.<br />\nThe University of Leipsig will celebrate its five hundredth anniversary in<br />\n1909.<br />\nPresident Eliot of Harvard recommends the following plan for a student's<br />\nday: Ten hours for study, eight for sleep, two for exercise and four for meals<br />\nand social duties.\u2014Ex.

Harvard, it is<br />\nsaid, has been playing in two inches of snow for the past two weeks and Lehigh<br />\nand Swarthmore have both heen doing outdoor work despite the weather. No<br />\nmatter how great an advantage the cage may be, the practice within its walls<br />\nmust nece,sarily be on a small scale and it is very important. that the squad<br />\nshould be gotten out as soon as possible in order to give the men an idea of the<br />\npositions and distances to be covered on a field of regulation size.<br />\nEx-Captain Schmeisser and Coach Abercrombie were much pleased with<br />\npractice<br />\nin the cage last Saturday. They both laid particular stress upon<br />\nthe<br />\nthe fact that the schedule this year is unquestionably the hardest ever arrayed<br />\nby the management, and urged the candidates to stop all smoking and drinking<br />\npreparatory to signing the training pledge which will probably be required next<br />\nweek. The remarkable work done by the 'Varsity twelve last year was mainly<br />\ndue to the fine condition of the men throughout the season. In a game requiring such a great amount of wind and endurance too much stress cannot be laid<br />\nupon the necessity of conscientious training. The absence of a training table<br />\nmake each player responsible in a large measure for his own condition. The<br />\ntrust should be rigidly lived up to by every man who has any chance to make<br />\nthe team.<br />\nRegarding the vacancies, there will be at least three attack and one defense positions to be filled by new men. The candidates who are at all promising have a good opportunity to figure in one or two, if not all the games.

Captain R. C. Hoffman has been putting the squad through all<br />\nkinds of preparatory stunts since the B. A. C. games. and should the handicapping be reasonable, we may expect to get a liberal share of the honors.<br />\nThe men who are to wear our cobors will be taken from the following: Dashes\u2014<br />\nFreeze, Sladen, Bond, \u2022Pessagno, Tootle, LeCron, Knight, Helmholz, Super.<br />\nMiddle Distance\u2014England, Tootle, LeCron, C L.

Somewhat to Hopkins' disappointment, the relay race will be run with Villa Nova College. The<br />\nlatter institutions always turns out a, well trained team, but Captain Hoffman<br />\nwas greatly in hope that a contest could be arranged either with the Carlisle<br />\nIndians or the United States Naval Academy. The Indian management very<br />\nfrankly wrote Manag r Dulaney that the team was not in sufficiently good condition to run against Hopkins, while the Navy has not developed a relay team<br />\nthis season.<br />\nThe games w ill be both handicap and scratch, and altogether Hopkins ex<br />\npects a reasonab y fair chance in all the events.<br />\nFor several days past Manager Dulany and Physical Director McDermott<br />\nhave been tryi ng to secure special rates for the occasion. Even if they do not<br />\nsucceed, the usual Saturday fare is opzii to all, and there is no reason why<br />\na bunch of rooters should not go with the team. The games will be held in<br />\nConvention Hall, at 8 o'clock.<br />\n\u2022 In m ost of the events Hopkins will have our old friends, the Maryland and<br />\nthe Balti more Athletic Clubs to down. The Boys' Latin School and Marston's<br />\nhave also entered teams.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nA piece of exceptional good fortune, which is not generally known to the<br />\nDirector MackderStiident body, was announced a few days ago by Physical<br />\nott. It is this: The Maryland Athletic Club has very kindly offered the<br />\nohns Hopkins track and field team the use of the Maryland Oval for training<br />\npurposes during the coming season.<br />\nThis is certainly a piece of genuine good luck, for the Oval is not only<br />\nmuch nearer town than Electric Park, but it is circled by a first-class quartermile cinder track. Besides this the grounds are strictly private and contain a<br />\nspacious club house equipped with,several shower baths.<br />\n<br />\n\f14<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins and M. A. C. have been on very intimate terms during the winter, and the present courtesy is simply a token of the good feeling which it is<br />\nhoped will continue to exist between Baltimore's most prominent institution of<br />\nlearning and her leading athletic organization.<br />\n<br />\nIf circumstances are favorable, Hopkins will hold her annual indoor games<br />\nat the Fifth Regiment Armory on March 28. No definite arrangements have as<br />\nyet been made.<br />\nBASE BALL ENTHUSIASTS.<br />\nASE BALL affairs began to assume a truly formidable aspect last Saturday afternoon, when 15 candidates showed up for the first regular practice of the season; and from now on they will report every Tuesday and<br />\nThursday, as well as on Saturday, for a little warming-up exercise. With the<br />\nfirst game only about two weeks off, it will be necessary for the men to attend<br />\nstrictly to business during the short time they can be together. As regards<br />\npractice, the base ball team is singularly unfortunate, in that the candidates are<br />\nso scattered that it is almost impossible to get them all together for practice,<br />\neven when grounds can be procured for the purpose. The team is further<br />\nhandicapped by the very limited amount of time that the \"medicos\" can spare.<br />\nIt is scarcely possible at this time to give with any great degree of accuracy the candidates for the several positions; therefore, too great faith must not<br />\nbe put in the following remarks Captain Whipple will again be seen doing<br />\nbusiness at the old stand in the box, with Ricksher, Wright, Crozier, and<br />\nPitcher as candidates for the same position. Constantine, who will give up<br />\nfirst base for a place behind the hat, may be succeeded by Ingraham or Goldman. Hand or Sladen will probably do the honors at second, with Marine or<br />\nNelson at third. Short will again be ably filled by Moore. For the outfield,<br />\n'the selection may be made from Wright, Marshall, Hand or Goldman. The<br />\nabove leaves Meloy, Campbell, and Straughn unaccounted for, as they cannot<br />\nyet be definitely located.<br />\nThe candidates who reported Saturday were: Whipple, Constantine, Ricksher, Ingraham, Meloy, Wright, Marine, Moore, Hand, Crozier, Sladen, Campbell, Goldman, Straughn and Pitcher. After the practice, a short, informal<br />\nbusiness meeting was held in the Trophy Room.

On<br />\nseveral recent occasions these exercises have been marked by announcements<br />\nof such importance as to excite interest wherever men are who concern themselves with the progress of American education. First came the University's \u2022<br />\napplication for aid from the State of Maryland; then various statements concerning the movements set going to restore her to the stabler position of the<br />\nfore-time, movements gradually centering in that final one by which the endowment fund of $1,000,000 was completed last summer, and last of all, the opening<br />\nof \"The Promised Land\" on upper Charles street. The optimists who<br />\nexpected President Remsen to acknowledge the gift of funds ample to cover the<br />\nHomewood acres with stately buildings in which the great fame of Hopkins<br />\nshall grow greater, as a proper culmination to the double quick of earlier events,<br />\nwere not fully gratified. President Remsen's own remarks indicated that he<br />\nhimself knew of many such.<br />\n\"A gentleman stopped me on .the street the other day and declared he<br />\nwould^be sorely disappointed unless I announced that we have enough money<br />\nin hand to build at. Homewood,\" he said. \"I could only smile then, and I can<br />\ndo nothing better now.\"<br />\n\"If you ask,'what, then are you going to do with Homewood?' I should<br />\nreply, that we shall for the present study it\u2014learn how it will best serve our<br />\nPurpose, and none but the ,best advice will suit us. You know already that<br />\nthe president of our Board, Mr. R. Brent Keyser, has provided funds to enable<br />\nus to secure expert advice. I may also tell you that the trustees, as many as<br />\ncan leave, will go this spring upon a tour of observation to learn what other<br />\nuniversities can teach us for the development of the Homewood land. They<br />\nwill visit Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, Virginia and other<br />\nplaces, too, perhaps.\"<br />\nThe memory of Henry A. Rowland, whose researches in physics, contributing a great measure to the renown of Johns Hopkins, will endure of their<br />\nown merit, is assured of fuller perpetuation in the University itself by a gift \u2022<br />\nannounced at the exercises. A student of the late Professor Rowland has<br />\noffered to buy a complete library covering the field of spectroscopy, which was<br />\n..<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\none of the special branches of science which Dr. Rowland cultivated for many<br />\nyears with great success. \"The Rowland Memorial Library of Spectroscopy\"<br />\nwill he the name of the new collection, and Mrs. Rowland has contributed to it<br />\nall of the Professor's own books on that subject.<br />\nBy the gift of $25,000 from Dr. and Mrs. Christian H. Herter, of New York,<br />\nthe University will be able to invite some eminent professor of that branch of<br />\nscience to lecture in Baltimore each year hereafter.<br />\nThe commemoration exercises were those which are generally familiar to<br />\nall who have ever been students at Johns Hopkins. The Academic procession,<br />\nthis year under the Chief Marshalship of Dr. Harry L Wilson, entered the<br />\nauditorium to a march rendered by an orchestra under the direction of Prof. W.<br />\nEdward Heimendahl of the Peabody Conservatory. President Remsen headed<br />\nthe line in company with the orator of the day, President Edwin A. Alderman,<br />\nof Tulane University, President Emeritus D. C. Gilman following with the<br />\nchaplain, Dr. Arthur Chilton Powell. The guests and several academic bodies<br />\ncoming after in the usual order.<br />\nThe President, the President Emeritus, and the Orator, occupied the center<br />\nof the stage, Dr. Remsen seated in the President Chair presented two years ago<br />\nby the Harvard Club of Maryland.<br />\nIn introducing the speaker of the day, President Remsen said: \"A year<br />\nago a company in Music Hall, at a banquet memorable in the annals of Johns<br />\nHopkins, weary, perhaps, with the lapse of hours, suddenly woke up. It was<br />\nnear midnight, but an electric shock had passed\u2014a speech generated it. It<br />\ncould not last long, however, because the next day was Sunday. When we<br />\ncame to prepare for this occasion it occurred to us that we could do no better<br />\nthan invite the man who made that speech a year ago to continue it here this<br />\nmorning. It gives me great pleasure, accordingly, to present to you President<br />\nAlderman of Tulane University, New Orleans\"<br />\nPresident Alderman's address was devoted for the most part to a retrospective and prospective view of the South. In the most glowing manner he<br />\nspoke of the splendid and noble attributes of the old South, not, however,<br />\nneglecting to acknowledge those defects and vices which have disappeared<br />\nbefore the forces of modern civilization. Referring to the present time, Dr.<br />\nAlderman told of the great change that has now progressed so far, the passing<br />\nof the traditional and agricultural South into the active, modern industrial community. Believing that the South has before it a great future, along with the<br />\nrest of the nation, President Alderman feels that the great need of the South is<br />\nthe placing of its educational system upon an equal footing with that which<br />\nexists in the most advanced and prosperous parts of the land.<br />\nThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy was conferred upon Mr. Frederick<br />\nHutton Getman, University of Virginia; Mr. Benjamin Leroy Miller, A. B.,<br />\nUniversity of Kansas, 1897; Mr. Henry Nevi11 Sanders, A. B., Trinity University, Toronto, 1894, and Mr. Daniel Naylor Shoemaker, S. B., Earlham College, 1895.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nAs previously noted in THrt NEWS-LETTER, Dr. Getman will enter next<br />\nSeptember upon a physical chemical investigation under a recent grant from<br />\nthe Carnegie Institute.<br />\nThe growing interest in the exercises caused such a demand for tickets that<br />\nmany persons were unable to obtain them and even a number of those holding<br />\ntickets were unable to gain admittance into the assembly room. Referring to<br />\nthe necessity of having a larger auditorium in which to hold the Commemo<br />\nration Day exercises, Dr. Remsen said: \"I do not know whether or not this<br />\nhall will serve us another year for our present purposes. There are too many<br />\nin it at this moment; but notwithstanding this we have been obliged to turn<br />\naway a great many of those we should like to see here. This could not be<br />\navoided, but we will try to devise means by which we may have all our friends<br />\nwith us on future occasions of this sort.\"<br /><br />\nTHE ALUMNI BANQUET.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nH E annual banquet of the Alumni Association held at the Carrollton Hotel<br />\non the night of the 23rd, made a fitting close for the day's celebration.<br />\nAt a short business meeting before the banquet, the gentlemen who had<br />\nbeen nominated by the Executive Committee, as announced in the last issue of<br />\nthe \u201cliftws-LETTHR,\" were elected to hold office for the ensuing year. The<br />\ncompany then proceeded to the banquet hall, where an excellent dinner was<br />\nthoroughly enjoyed. At the conclusion, toast-master Dr. W. T. Sedgwick, the<br />\nretiring president of the association, made a short address of welcome to the<br />\nAlumni, in which he dwelt strongly on the national character of the University,<br />\nwhich he said was the pioneer in the work of nationalizing the educational field<br />\nof the country. He also spoke of the vast amount of useful work which the<br />\nUniversity could do if only the requisite funds were provided. Those who responded to toasts were:\u2014<br />\nDr. Gilman. introduced as the \"Master of Johns Hopkins,\" who<br />\nspoke of the national influence exerted by the Univetsity, and mentioned many<br />\nof its graduates who have attained distinction in the various paths of life, es-,<br />\npecially in the province of higher education.<br />\nPresident Remsen, who emphasized the fact that the true purpose of a university was to train men for scientific investigation. He said that, as the de<br />\nmand for investigators in this country far exceeded the supply, he believed such<br />\ninstitutions as the Carnegie and Rockefellet Institutes to be detrimental; for<br />\nthey tend to draw away from the universities men fitted to train these investigators<br />\nDr. Alderman, who depicted the noble grander of the \"scholar-patriot.\"<br />\nMr. Theodore Marburg, who spoke on behalf of the trustees.<br />\nProfessor H.

U.; or box 398, Medical School of Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br /><br />\nECENTLY a great scare was given the men who make the barber shop their<br />\nofficial headquarters when not attending classes. Owing to an order<br />\nwhich emanated from some unknown source all the chairs were removed<br />\nfrom the room. Fortunately for those tired mortals who settle all the great<br />\nquestions of the day, while seated in the chairs which have been provided for<br />\nWalter's patrons, on the following day the chairs were returned, and the dove<br />\nof peace settled once more above the doorway. Had the chairs not been returned, although the NEWS.LETTER would have objected, yet it would have<br />\nbeen honest enough to acknowledge that there was wisdom in the order which<br />\nemanated from the aforesaid unseen source. We cannot deny that the barber<br />\nshop is most conducive to that most catching of college diseases\u2014loafing. We<br />\ncannot deny that as a result of the above mentioned disease the place at times<br />\ndoes not present the most tidy appearance. We cannot deny that at times the<br />\natmosphere is dense with .the smoke of the vile weed. We cannot deny that<br />\nWalter some times gets so interested in a story or a colloquy that he inadvertently chips off a corner of the face of some trusting, unwary patron. In all<br />\nthis there is danger. But on the other hand there is one thing which, to our<br />\nmind, overbalances these drawbacks and turns the scales in favor of providing<br />\nseats for those men who prefer idleness to industry, and the freedom of a barber<br />\nshop debate to the august solemnness of the house or the senate. It is this<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nCollege life at best is but for a shOrt season. Soon the men who now are engaged<br />\nin looking at life from what we may call a theoretical view point will be looking<br />\nat the same problem from its practical side, and in mmory they will live over<br />\nagain their college days They will not think of the days spent in the laboratory as much EIS they will of the days spent in chasing the pigskin over the<br />\nfield, they will not think of the dry lectures as much as the wet banquets, and<br />\nthey will not think of the papers they read in class as much as they will of the<br />\nhours stolen from study to spend in the midst of that bohemian organization<br />\nknown as the Fernandig Club. In a word, it is not the memory of the duh<br />\nfaithfully done which brings the same pleasure in after years as the mcmory of<br />\nthose moments of relaxation when we .pause in the harness to take breath before continuing the steady pull up the hill. We have no historic \"fence\" upon<br />\nwhich the upper classmen may perch, we have no historic steps upon which the<br />\nmen may sing college ballads, we have nothing but Walter's barbershop. So<br />\nlet us try and preserve that intact. And may every man, when his day comes<br />\nto leave, carry away with him no darker view of college life than that he obtains in Walter's tonsorial parlor!<br />\nN an article in the last issue of the NEWS\u2014LETTER under the heading of<br />\n\"Base Ball for 1903,\" it was stated that the \"statement may now be accepted as authoritative that Hopkins will have a base ball team this<br />\nseason.\" This was erroneous, and the NEWS LETTER regrets that it was given<br />\nto the public in a manner which seemed to vouch for the authenticity of the report. As long ago as the holidays the Athletic Board declared that there<br />\nwould be no representative team this season. It is true that a team composed<br />\nof Hopkins men will play during the season; but they have not the sanction ot<br />\nthe Athletic Board, nor are they at liberty to use Hopkins' name as has been<br />\ndone in several newspaper articles and in the last issue of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe base ball enthusiasts are in the main men from the Medical School, and if<br />\nthe team takes the field as an independent, self-supporting organization it might<br />\nwell be called the Johns Hopkins Medical School Base Ball Team, as at Yale<br />\nthere is a Yale Law School Base Ball Team. This would relieve the men from<br />\nbeing under the authority and discipline of the Athletic Association. Although<br />\nthe team will be composed of University men it must be understood that the<br />\nAthletic Association offers no guarantee for the fulfillment of their pledges<br /><br />\nj<br /><br />\nWING to the inclement weather the annual concert by the Musical Clubs<br />\nat Lehmann's Hall was not as largely attended as it would have been<br />\nunder more favorable conditions, But the management are well content<br />\nwith the financial result of the concert. From an artistic point of view the concert<br />\nwas a veritable triumph. The leaders showed excellent discrimination in their<br />\nselection of pieces,\u2022and the men sang and played with that hearty good will<br />\nwhich characterizes college men when they have an apprecia'ive audience.<br />\nThe Easter trip is not far distant, and the men are certain of an enthusiastic reception wherever they appear if they keep up to the high mark set by<br />\ntheir Baltimore performance.<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nPROSPECTS FOR THE COMING DEBATE.<br />\nS the time draws nearer for the inter-class debate which will probably he<br />\nheld on March 2 1 st, interest on the part of those who are contesting for<br />\nthe various places on the teams is perceptibly increasing. Both Juniors<br />\nand Seniors are buckling down to work. and are sifting out all the material they<br />\ncan find on the subject of the debate. Practice is held every day under the<br />\ndirection of Dr. Lee and Mr. Burgess of the Baltimore School of Oratory, at<br />\nwhich times the echoes of McCoy Hall are rudely awakened by the impassioned<br />\neloquence of aspiring orators. Indeed, every indication seems to show that<br />\nboth sides will put up a stiff fight on the.night of the twenty-first.<br />\nThe cbntest has, however, narrowed down to six men on each side from<br />\nwhich the speakers and alternates of the two teams will be chosen.<br />\nFor the Seniors, these are Plaggemeyer, Blum, Strayer, Tootle, Addison,<br />\nGlocker.<br />\nFor the Juniors, they are Licking, Humrichouse, Foster, Rosenheim,<br />\nStollenwerck, Crozier.<br />\nIt has also been decided to have adviEers as in former years. The advisers<br />\nfor the Seniors will probably be Custis, Ammen, Parsons, and Hopper. Those<br />\nfor the Juniors wiil be chosen from Loyd, Emig, Geiger, Wallis, and Opie<br />\nThe Freshmen who will contest on the night of the debate for the medal<br />\noffered by Dr. Lee, will be selected from Strauglin, Boyce, Ziegler and Goldman.<br />\nAfter the inter-class contest, comes the debate with North Carolina. The<br />\nsouthern university has, so report says, put us down as one of their regular<br />\nannular scalps, but we want to disappoint them, and wipe out the defeat of<br />\nlast year by carrying victory into the heart of the Carolinas. To do this, every<br />\nman must come out and work. It is probable that the speakers who will represent Hopkins will be selected from the inter-class debating teams, but every<br />\nundergraduate is eligible, and, if he only makes manifest his latent ability, will<br />\nreceive due consideration. But those who do not possess the gift of eloquence<br />\nare not absolved. Valuable assistance can be rendered by a squad of enthusiastic workers who will help to write speeches,, run down material, and, above<br />\nall, criticise the arguments of the speakers, instead of waiting, as usual, for<br />\ndefeat to he announced before letting forth a stored.up flood of criticism.<br /><br />\nIIC<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE TAILOR PRIZES WON BY HOPKINS MEN.<br />\nHE February number of the College Tailor, which, we recall, is being Published by Lemmert, should be of especial interest to Hopkins men, not<br />\nonly because it is dedicated to the University of North Carolina with<br />\nwhom we have been on the most intimate terms, but because both the prize<br />\nstories therein were written by Hopkins men. In the first issue of the College<br />\nTailor, prizes were offered for the best football and hunting stories. These<br />\nwere captured by Mr. Walter B.

That the Baltimore public<br />\nappreciate a '`good thing\" when they see it was proved by the large audience which greeted them, and which enthusiastically applauded the various<br />\nselections.<br />\nThe concert hall was tastefully decorated with Southern smilax; the stage,<br />\nbanked with flowers and surmounted with the University motto in huge letters,<br />\nproduced a very pleasing effect. Placed at intervals on the walls were the different class flags, and the athletic banners,\u2014reminders of 'varsity successes.<br />\nThe large number of patronesses, outside friends of the University, as well<br />\nas the wives of the members of the faculty, contributed much to the success of<br />\nthe evening.<br />\nThe program opened with the University Ode. Then came some rollicking<br />\nsongs, and marches by the banjo and mandolin clubs. Selections by the quartette appeared twice on the program, and each time the members, T. H. Coffin,<br />\nF. J. Hall, F. R. Ford and P. K. Gilman. received a warm reception from the<br />\naudience. The Glee Club was greatly appreciated in the 1902 and 1903 medleys, arranged by W. B Carver.<br />\nThe selection \"Violets\" was particularly well rendered by the mandolin<br />\nclub, as was also the \"Baltimore Centennial,\" in which \"Dixie\" was played as<br />\na clarionet solo, while the mandolins and violins played \"Maryland. My Maryland.\" The program ended with a new Hopkins song. \"The Toast Song,\" of<br />\nwhich the words and music were composed by R. S. Lanier, our ex-editor-inchief.<br />\nThe Mandolin Club is deserving of much praise. It surpasses last year's<br />\nclub in volume and unity of tone, and the members show that they have been<br />\nwell trained under their leader, J. W. Bryan. The Glee Club, under the able<br />\nleadership of W. B. Carver, did very satisfactory work, and is to be commended. The Banjo Club, with C. A. Marshall as leader, was excellent. They<br />\nplayed with the same spirit and dash that characterized last year's club.<br />\nAltogether the concert was successful from every point of view. The management and players are to be congratulated on their efforts. Most encouraging of all is the fact that the concert was a financial success, insuring the clubs<br />\na<br />\ngood Easter trip.<br /><br />\nY. M. C. A NOTES.<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nN Saturday evening, February 21, eight Hopkins men joined with about<br />\nfifty other men of Baltimore colleges in a Northfield supper at the invi \u2022<br />\ntation of the Baltimore Mt. Hermon Club. The Mt. Hermon Club is<br />\nthe organization of the alumni of Mr Moody's school, just across the river<br />\nfrom Northfield, Mass. The object of the gathering was to arouse interest in<br />\nthe summer student conference at Northfield next summer, June 26 to July 5.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nThis object tvas accomplished by six brief talks on the various sides of Northfield life and by much fun and reminiscing during the supper. There is always a strong feeling of friendship and enthusiasm among a party of men who<br />\nhave been to Northfield.<br />\nThe State convention for Delaware, Maryland and District of Columbia, in<br />\nBaltimore, March 6, 7 and 8, bids fair to be of interest to college men. The<br />\nSaturday sessions will be of special interest, and the afternoon, with possibly<br />\nthe morning session, will be held in Levering Hall. Mr. A. B. Williams, Jr.,<br />\nsecretary of college work of the east, will have charge of the student conference.<br />\nHe comes to us from a visit to the U. of P. and other institutions in the east,<br />\nand Hopkins should give him a good welcome. St. John's, Western Maryland<br />\nand other colleges expect to send large delegations. Hazlehurst, J. T. Smith,<br />\nJr., Sandrock, Hildt and Lloyd are a committee looking after the entertainment<br />\nof some of these men. It is desired that as many Hopkins men as possible<br />\nwill come to the Saturday afternoon session.<br />\nMr. Williams will remain a few days after the convention to meet the Hop \u2022<br />\nkins men here and at the Medical School, and will lead the meeting Tuesday,<br />\nMarch 10, at 5 o'clock. He is a Yale man of considerable experience in college<br />\nassociation work.<br />\nThe attendance at morning prayers has fallen off lately. It is hoped that<br />\nChristian men who have the nine o'clock period on will avail themselves of<br />\nG.<br />\nthis little opportunity for quiet worship.<br /><br />\nAMONG THE COLLEGES.<br />\nThe University of Michigan has 15,000 alumni, Harvard has 14,000 and<br />\nYale 11,436.<br />\nThe new gymnasium which is beitig built at Princeton will be the largest<br />\nbuilding of its kind in the world, the main floor being 100 by 166 feet.<br />\nThe Yale Football Association bid a surplus in the treasury this year of<br />\n$17,077.<br />\nThe University of Leipsig will celebrate its five hundredth anniversary in<br />\n1909.<br />\nPresident Eliot of Harvard recommends the following plan for a student's<br />\nday: Ten hours for study, eight for sleep, two for exercise and four for meals<br />\nand social duties.\u2014Ex. Is this a joke?<br />\nOne of the features of Yale's dining hall is the \"international table\" at<br />\nwhich are tren from almost all countries of Europe, from the Philippines,<br />\nJapan, and the Hawaiian Islands.<br />\nThe Carnegie Institute has granted $10,000 to the University of Chicago<br />\nYerfor research work, $6,000 goes to the department of geology and $4,000 to<br />\nkes observatory.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nLACROSSE DOINGS.<br />\niloPKINS LACROSSE SCHEDULE, 1903.<br />\nApril 4\u2014University of Pennsylvania.<br />\nApril 1 I\u2014Hobart College.<br />\nApril 18\u2014Stevens Institute.<br />\nApril 25\u2014Lehigh U niversity.<br />\nMay 2\u2014Swarthnkme College.<br />\nMay 7\u2014Crescent A.

Harvard, it is<br />\nsaid, has been playing in two inches of snow for the past two weeks and Lehigh<br />\nand Swarthmore have both heen doing outdoor work despite the weather. No<br />\nmatter how great an advantage the cage may be, the practice within its walls<br />\nmust nece,sarily be on a small scale and it is very important. that the squad<br />\nshould be gotten out as soon as possible in order to give the men an idea of the<br />\npositions and distances to be covered on a field of regulation size.<br />\nEx-Captain Schmeisser and Coach Abercrombie were much pleased with<br />\npractice<br />\nin the cage last Saturday. They both laid particular stress upon<br />\nthe<br />\nthe fact that the schedule this year is unquestionably the hardest ever arrayed<br />\nby the management, and urged the candidates to stop all smoking and drinking<br />\npreparatory to signing the training pledge which will probably be required next<br />\nweek. The remarkable work done by the 'Varsity twelve last year was mainly<br />\ndue to the fine condition of the men throughout the season. In a game requiring such a great amount of wind and endurance too much stress cannot be laid<br />\nupon the necessity of conscientious training. The absence of a training table<br />\nmake each player responsible in a large measure for his own condition. The<br />\ntrust should be rigidly lived up to by every man who has any chance to make<br />\nthe team.<br />\nRegarding the vacancies, there will be at least three attack and one defense positions to be filled by new men. The candidates who are at all promising have a good opportunity to figure in one or two, if not all the games.

Captain R. C. Hoffman has been putting the squad through all<br />\nkinds of preparatory stunts since the B. A. C. games. and should the handicapping be reasonable, we may expect to get a liberal share of the honors.<br />\nThe men who are to wear our cobors will be taken from the following: Dashes\u2014<br />\nFreeze, Sladen, Bond, \u2022Pessagno, Tootle, LeCron, Knight, Helmholz, Super.<br />\nMiddle Distance\u2014England, Tootle, LeCron, C L.

Somewhat to Hopkins' disappointment, the relay race will be run with Villa Nova College. The<br />\nlatter institutions always turns out a, well trained team, but Captain Hoffman<br />\nwas greatly in hope that a contest could be arranged either with the Carlisle<br />\nIndians or the United States Naval Academy. The Indian management very<br />\nfrankly wrote Manag r Dulaney that the team was not in sufficiently good condition to run against Hopkins, while the Navy has not developed a relay team<br />\nthis season.<br />\nThe games w ill be both handicap and scratch, and altogether Hopkins ex<br />\npects a reasonab y fair chance in all the events.<br />\nFor several days past Manager Dulany and Physical Director McDermott<br />\nhave been tryi ng to secure special rates for the occasion. Even if they do not<br />\nsucceed, the usual Saturday fare is opzii to all, and there is no reason why<br />\na bunch of rooters should not go with the team. The games will be held in<br />\nConvention Hall, at 8 o'clock.<br />\n\u2022 In m ost of the events Hopkins will have our old friends, the Maryland and<br />\nthe Balti more Athletic Clubs to down. The Boys' Latin School and Marston's<br />\nhave also entered teams.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nA piece of exceptional good fortune, which is not generally known to the<br />\nDirector MackderStiident body, was announced a few days ago by Physical<br />\nott. It is this: The Maryland Athletic Club has very kindly offered the<br />\nohns Hopkins track and field team the use of the Maryland Oval for training<br />\npurposes during the coming season.<br />\nThis is certainly a piece of genuine good luck, for the Oval is not only<br />\nmuch nearer town than Electric Park, but it is circled by a first-class quartermile cinder track. Besides this the grounds are strictly private and contain a<br />\nspacious club house equipped with,several shower baths.<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nHopkins and M. A. C. have been on very intimate terms during the winter, and the present courtesy is simply a token of the good feeling which it is<br />\nhoped will continue to exist between Baltimore's most prominent institution of<br />\nlearning and her leading athletic organization.<br /><br />\nIf circumstances are favorable, Hopkins will hold her annual indoor games<br />\nat the Fifth Regiment Armory on March 28. No definite arrangements have as<br />\nyet been made.<br />\nBASE BALL ENTHUSIASTS.<br />\nASE BALL affairs began to assume a truly formidable aspect last Saturday afternoon, when 15 candidates showed up for the first regular practice of the season; and from now on they will report every Tuesday and<br />\nThursday, as well as on Saturday, for a little warming-up exercise. With the<br />\nfirst game only about two weeks off, it will be necessary for the men to attend<br />\nstrictly to business during the short time they can be together. As regards<br />\npractice, the base ball team is singularly unfortunate, in that the candidates are<br />\nso scattered that it is almost impossible to get them all together for practice,<br />\neven when grounds can be procured for the purpose. The team is further<br />\nhandicapped by the very limited amount of time that the \"medicos\" can spare.<br />\nIt is scarcely possible at this time to give with any great degree of accuracy the candidates for the several positions; therefore, too great faith must not<br />\nbe put in the following remarks Captain Whipple will again be seen doing<br />\nbusiness at the old stand in the box, with Ricksher, Wright, Crozier, and<br />\nPitcher as candidates for the same position. Constantine, who will give up<br />\nfirst base for a place behind the hat, may be succeeded by Ingraham or Goldman. Hand or Sladen will probably do the honors at second, with Marine or<br />\nNelson at third. Short will again be ably filled by Moore. For the outfield,<br />\n'the selection may be made from Wright, Marshall, Hand or Goldman. The<br />\nabove leaves Meloy, Campbell, and Straughn unaccounted for, as they cannot<br />\nyet be definitely located.<br />\nThe candidates who reported Saturday were: Whipple, Constantine, Ricksher, Ingraham, Meloy, Wright, Marine, Moore, Hand, Crozier, Sladen, Campbell, Goldman, Straughn and Pitcher. After the practice, a short, informal<br />\nbusiness meeting was held in the Trophy Room.
