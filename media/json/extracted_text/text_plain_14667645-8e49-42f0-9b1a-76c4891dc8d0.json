Some Council members see themselves as \"trustees\": they feel<br />\nthat they must reflect the wishes of the undergraduates.<br />\nOthers see themselves as \"free-agents\": they believe that<br />\nthey can most effectively serve their constituents if they<br />\nvote their conscience, even if they must vote contrary<br />\nto the wishes of their. constituents.<br />\nWhether one regards himself as a \"trustee\" or<br />\nas a \"free-agent,\" he would surely agree that in accepting the responsibilities of office he is honor bound<br />\nto give his constituents an effective voice in the Council.<br />\nHe Must, of course, be sure that his voice and that of<br />\nhis constituents is recorded by vote. There are times\u2014<br />\nwhen he disagrees with his constituents or when he or<br />\nhis constituents are personally involved in the<br />\nsubject being discussed\u2014when he feels he must abstain<br />\nfrom voting. He may, then, withhold his opinion and<br />\nhis vote out of prudence, but never out of cowardice.<br />\nTo do 80 would be to betray the trust given him by his<br />\nconstituents.<br />\nWe believe that Richard Bensinger, president of<br />\nthe DSRC and DSRC representative on the Council,<br />\nbetrayed the trust granted him by the dormitory students by a abstaining on the fraternity motion defeated<br />\nby the Council Monday night. The motion was one of<br />\nthe most significant considered the Council in recent<br />\nyears. Bensinger's first explanations for his abstention were based on pleas of cowardice. He then later<br />\nexplained that he really abstained because he needed<br />\nmore time to think about the motion.<br />\nIf he did want time to think, why did he not ask<br />\nthe Council to table the motion for a week.

As in past years,<br />\nthe radio outfit remained the largest active student organization with 70 undergraduates participating in positions ranging from disc jockeys to<br />\ntechnicians<br />\nThe campus network began operations in 1952<br />\nin a site in Ames Hall. It presently has its studio<br />\nin the basement of the Alumni Memorial Residences. Since its inception in '52, the station has<br />\nbeen beset by financial difficulties with this year<br />\nproving no exception. During the summer, a returning member decided to improve the technical<br />\nfacilities and subsequently installed a new control panel. The installation, however, exceeded the<br />\nstation's maximum budget by $300. The board of<br />\ncontrol is still reeling from that blow (which<br />\nhas been resolved by obtaining the most advertising since 1955.)<br />\nMakes Official Tapes<br />\nWJHU has made an active effort so far this<br />\nsemester to expand its services. It has been designated by COSE to make the official tapes of<br />\nall major speeches presented on campus and,<br />\naccording to station manager Wolff, will present<br />\nits complete file of past speeches to the new<br />\ncampus library. In addition, the station will also<br />\ntape all the speeches in the current special freshman series and will rebroadcast them at regular<br />\nintervals.<br />\n<br />\nfeel that the free publicity we provide for their<br />\nreleases is worth the small investment. This year,<br />\nwe have gotten mostly folk albums, although the<br />\nmajority of the records in our library are classical.\"<br />\nAlthough the station has a fine collection of<br />\nclassical recordings, most potential DJ.'s request<br />\nrock and roll shows. If nothing else, the latter<br />\nshows can boast the most imaginative names and<br />\nformats, with names including \"The Louie, Louie<br />\nShow,\" and \"Pandora's Box,\" \"B.J. the D.J.\" In<br />\ngeneral programming schedule places the rock and<br />\nroll shows on first (6:00 P.M.) with the music<br />\ntype become more subdued as the evening goes on.<br />\nMaintains Professional Level<br />\n\"At the beginning,\" Wolff commented, \"we<br />\ntried to set quotas to provide a balance in programming, but we have found that most aspiring<br />\nDJ's do not want to play classical. Consequently,<br />\nalthough we seek diversification, our main concern is to maintain as professional a level as<br />\npossible in broadcasting. We have also attempted<br />\nto eliminate obscenity on the shows.<br />\nAside from the ever-present fmancial problems,<br />\nWJHU is hampered primarily by an inexperienced<br />\nstaff and by insufficient broadcasting range. Its<br />\nstaff is composed almost entirely of dormitory<br />\nupperclassmen and freshmen (50) with only<br />\nsix members living off-campus. The inexperience<br />\nproblem arises from the fact that only about five<br />\nof the seventy active members have ever worked<br />\nprofessionally on other stations.<br />\n<br />\nThe station had planned to cover the last two<br />\naway football games from Swarthmore (November<br />\n7). and Western Maryland (November 21)<br />\nHowever, the feasibility of doing such broadcasts depends on the stabilization of the financial<br />\nsituation. Already big expenditures are anticipated<br />\nfrom doing the play-by-play of the spring lacrosse<br />\ngames at Annapolis and Syracuse.<br />\n<br />\nThe campus network transmits on a mere 4 watt<br />\noutput (this is all the FCC permits) and so<br />\npresently reaches only the dorms and the Bradford Apartments.

Ground was<br />\nbroken for the 4.5 million dollar building in June<br />\n1962. All funds have come from private and corporate<br />\ndonors.<br />\nThe library was designed to give both the present<br />\nlibrary system much needed space and to implement<br />\nthe University's research activities in the humanities,<br />\nsciences and social sciences. Placed in what Hopkins<br />\nlibrarian John H. Berthel considers a \"central\" location, it is easily accessible from either the dorms,<br />\nGilman Hall, or the other buildings of Keyser and<br />\nWyman quads. The new building will be ready for<br />\nuse in a few days. It will have hours of 8 a.m. to<br />\nmidnight.<br />\nUnity Maintained<br />\nOf the library's six stories, each close to football<br />\nfield length, four and one-half have been placed below ground. This maintains the architectural unity<br />\nof the campus which is patterned after the two-story<br />\nGeorgian design of Homewood House.<br />\nAs one enters the new library from Keyser Quadrangle he sees the exhibition and display gallery of<br />\nthe building's top floor. A lounge-lecture room, highfidelity record and F. M. equipment, and a staff<br />\nlounge, as well as the library's administrative offices<br />\nare also located on this floor.<br />\nCentral Chandelier<br />\nWide staircases lead around a large, circular chandelier to the floor below. The main entrance, from<br />\nCharles Street, joins these stairs about half-way<br />\ndown. Together a single, broad stairway then leads<br />\nonto the main floor.<br />\nThe circulation desk, a book checker, and the<br />\nunion catalogue are located around this central foyer.<br />\nTo the north on the main floor and behind the cir-<br />\n<br />\nculation desk is the main technical services area of<br />\nthe library. Here books will be catalogued and prepared for the shelves. A service elevator and stairs<br />\nalso connect this part of the building with the floors<br />\nbelow.<br />\nPublic Elevators<br />\n<br />\nTo the south is located the Documents Reading<br />\nRoom and the Valuable Books Reading Room. Two<br />\npublic elevators, located to the left of the corridor,<br />\ndescend to the floors below. Further down and separated by the main corridor is the Humanities-Social<br />\nSciences Reference and Reading Rooms on the right<br />\nand the Science Engineering facility of a similar design on the left.<br />\nEach of these reference rooms will have a seating<br />\ncapacity of 50 persons and is closely connected to an<br />\nopen lounge at the extreme south end of the floor. The<br />\nlounge itself opens onto a sun porch that may be utilized during periods of good weather.<br />\nOn the floor below, designated Stack Level A, current periodicals will be kept. A Periodicals Reading<br />\nLounge lies directly under the open air terrace on the<br />\nfloor and, close by, is space for 10,000 individual periodicals. At present only half that number will be displayed.<br />\nEnclosed Items<br />\nValuable book stacks, enveloped by wire cages, will<br />\nalso be stored on this floor with a separate stairway<br />\nentering them from the Valuable Books Reading<br />\nRoom overhead. Selected Special Collections will also<br />\nbe placed in these enclosed stacks.<br />\nThe campus photo-duplicating laboratory, a bindery<br />\nfor the maintenance of the library's books, a loading<br />\ndock, a receiving room, and unsorted book storage<br />\nstacks will also grace this level. A map room, housing<br />\nthe University's map collection, janitorial and maintenance areas, the Audio-Visual Department, and the<br />\nFine Arts stacks complete the floor. The audio-visual<br />\narea will include the University's collection of records<br />\nand equipment upon which to play them. The Fine<br />\nArts area includes a seminar room, office space, a<br />\nslide storage, and an art vault.<br />\n<br />\nStack Level B, the floor below, will house the<br />\nDocuments Library stacks. The core of the library,<br />\nmiles of gorgeous open stacks, starts in<br />\nearnest on<br />\nthis floor. Interlaced with the stacks are<br />\nnumerous<br />\nstudent carrels with individual storage<br />\ncages above<br />\nthem. Along the walls are private studies,<br />\neach containing a desk, file cabinets, space for a<br />\nportable<br />\ntypewriter, and separate thermostats.<br />\nThese are<br />\nprimarily for faculty members and advanced<br />\ngraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThere are also two seminar rooms<br />\nand three typing areas (available for noisier \"bull\"<br />\nsessions should<br />\nthe need for a soundproof room arise).<br />\nThe south<br />\nend of this floor, as on all the floors above<br />\nand below, is a lounge and reading area. This end<br />\nis the<br />\nonly part of the library that remains above<br />\nground<br />\nthroughout the building, and students acquiring<br />\nclaustrophobia or other ailments in the depths of the<br />\nstacks are urged to use the lounge as an<br />\n\"escape<br />\nhatch.\"<br />\nComputer Space<br />\nStack levels C and D contain more free-stand<br />\ning<br />\nstacks, student carrels, studies, typing and<br />\nseminar<br />\nrooms. Furthermore, the north and northeast<br />\nsections of the bottom floor (Level D) will<br />\nhouse the<br />\nHomewood Campus's computers. This is perhaps<br />\nthe<br />\nmost novel feature of the library. A sacrifice of<br />\n4,300<br />\nsquare feet of floor space to the computers is considered well worth the price. Both the library<br />\nitself,<br />\nwith its interest in Operations Research, and departments throughout the Campus will benefit from this<br />\ncentralization. In addition Homewood, the Medical<br />\nSchools, and the Applied Physics Laboratory will all<br />\nhave their computers connected by special wiring<br />\nlinks.<br />\nIn summing up the new building, librarian Berthel<br />\nemphasized that it should not be considered<br />\nparticularly revolutionary in design, but rather, a reflection<br />\non the current fashions in library planning. \"I'm<br />\nexcited about it,\" he said, \"but this is not a unique<br />\nor utopian arrangement. I hope it's as good as<br />\nwe<br />\nthink it is.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE NOVEMBER 6, 1964<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE THREE<br />\n<br />\nArt<br />\nWorks by Rembrandt, Picasso, and Van Dyke will<br />\nbe among those displayed in an art exhibit in the<br />\nnorth and south galleries of the new library starting<br />\nSaturday and lasting until Nov. 15.<br />\n<br />\nthe exhibit will be a Norman Rockwell portrait of<br />\nDwight D. Eisenhower, donated by University president, Milton S. Eisenhower. Dr. Eisenhower is also<br />\ndonating a work by Diego Rivera, the celebrated Mexican muralist.<br />\nAmong the many works of interest, Dr. Rearick<br />\npoints out the three illuminated manuscripts donated<br />\nby Dr. Bober, visiting Professor of Humanities, from<br />\nN.Y.U. These are of the Beauvals school, and date<br />\nback to the thirteenth century. A handsome bronze by<br />\nthe Venetian, Tiziano Aspetti will also be displayed,<br />\ndonated by Dr. Truesdel. These works, along with all<br />\nothers of the pre-twentieth century category will be<br />\ndisplayed in the North gallery.<br />\nThe modern works will be displayed in the South<br />\ngallery, and will include works by Picasso, Lautrec,<br />\n<br />\nDr. W. R. Rearick, of the Art Department organized<br />\nthe exhibit, which is composed of works taken from<br />\ncollections of the faculty of both the Hospital and<br />\nHomewood. Dr. Rearick said that the exhibit is the<br />\nfirst of its kind at Hopkins, and that if successful, may<br />\nbe the forerunner of others.<br />\nThe exhibit reflects, in Dr. Rearick's words, the<br />\n\"very good taste\" of the faculty, and is composed of<br />\nMainly contemporary works. Only two or three have<br />\never been exhibited to the public before.<br />\nDr. Rearick predicts that the most popular work in<br />\n<br />\nand Rodin. Dr. Rearick also points out that there will<br />\nbe a generous display of works by artists from the<br />\nBaltimore area.<br />\nThe exhibit has taken several weeks to prepare,<br />\nwith the actual collection of works the most difficult<br />\ntask. Dr. Rearick points out that a great many of the<br />\nfaculty collect art, more so than at many other schools,<br />\nand that his biggest problem was finding out who had<br />\nwhat works to loan.<br />\nWhen asked about the future of the library as an<br />\nexhibition hall, Dr. Rearick said that there were no<br />\ndefinite plans as yet, but that it is hoped that a<br />\npermanent collection might be established by donations to the University. At the South end of the<br />\nbuilding is a sculpture court, and in time enough<br />\nsculpture to make it worthwhile is expected to be donated.<br />\n<br />\nArchitecture<br />\nThe new library was designed so that it would<br />\nbe unobtrusive to the rest of the architecture<br />\nIn Keyster Quadrangle. Only one and a half<br />\nstories rise above the quadrangle level allowing Gilman Hall to remain the dominant edifice on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nFrom the east the tower of Gilman appears to<br />\nrise from the roof of the library as if it were an<br />\nappendage. The large glass area opening on to Charles<br />\nStreet permits a view of Gilman through the library.<br />\nThe building was designed by the two Baltimore<br />\narchitectural firms of Wrenn, Lewis, and Jencks; and<br />\nMeyer and Ayers.<br />\nThe architects found a solution to the problem<br />\nOf building a hugh structure on campus, without offsetting the apparent architectural unity, by placing<br />\nMuch of the building under ground.<br />\nThe library descends five stories below ground<br />\nWith area on each level about the size of a football<br />\nfield. There is room for over 1,500,000 books and research facilities such as visual aids and phonographs.<br />\nThe lower levels of the library were constructed<br />\nUsing metal pan construction. Cement, in this process,<br />\n<br />\nIs poured over inverted pans. When the cement<br />\nhardens the pans are removed from below giving<br />\nthe ceilings a waffled terrain. The advantage of this<br />\nconstruction method is that it permits the strength<br />\nof very thick floors while allowing weight to be<br />\nreduced.<br />\nThe first floor of the library opens into the<br />\nquad level with walls rising two and a half stories.<br />\nStairs surround this open area permitting access to<br />\neach floor.<br />\nThe quadrangle level halls will serve as a gallery<br />\nto permit a picturesque entryway at the west. Also<br />\non this level will be the library administrative offices<br />\nand reception rooms with adjoining kitchens.<br />\nAs the structure under ground exceeds in area<br />\nthe part of the building that rises above quad level,<br />\nthe roof of the lower floors provides a large patio<br />\nat the quadrangle. At the south of the library, on<br />\nthe patio, is a large square hole opening into the<br />\nfirst floor to permit light to enter the reference areas.<br />\nThe whole south end of the library opens into<br />\na semibowled garden so as to permit light into the<br />\n<br />\n.....<br />\n<br />\nlounging areas. The rest of the lower levels is artificially lit.<br />\nAn overall view of the building from Charles<br />\nStreet shows it adjacent to Homewood House, the oldest building on campus and one of the finest examples<br />\nof English Colonial architecture in the world. Although the new building, constructed 165 years after<br />\nHomewood House, bears much of the same attendant<br />\ndecorative features, the two buildings are very much<br />\ndissimilar.<br />\nThe gently sloping roof and dormers have been<br />\nreplaced by a flat roof.

No federal or state<br />\nfunds were used.<br />\nIn 1958 the University and the Hospital announced<br />\na ten year development program. Of the four top<br />\npriority items, one was a new library on the Homewood Campus.<br />\nOn January 9, 1961 the Board of Trustees, at the<br />\nrequest of Dr. Eisenhower, gave highest place to<br />\nthe raising of funds for the library. To instigate<br />\nthis they accepted President Eisenhower's recommendation that one million dollars from the University's<br />\nFord grant be placed in the fund. In addition, the<br />\nTrustees themselves each contributed to the fund. All<br />\nthis underscored the extreme importance the University placed on building the library.<br />\nClose Finish<br />\nWith only 2.5 million of the total sum required<br />\nthe contract was let for the building. This unprecedented move permitted the building to be completed<br />\nless than six months after June 1964, the month the<br />\nmoney was finally raised.<br />\nInstrumental in the fund raising was Albert Hutzler, a Trustee and chairman of the Trustee Building<br />\nCommittee when the library was planned.

Instead, he will now be issued a<br />\nlibrary card of some sort which he merely places on<br />\ntop of the book(s) he wishes to check out. The combination will be microfilmed (ID plus the books spine<br />\nand front cover) at the circulation desk. Then a stamp<br />\nwith the date due will be stuck on the book. The student may now safely pass through the checker's portals. Furthermore, should anyone try removing the<br />\nsticker and placing it on another book it mysteriously<br />\nchanges color for all to see.<br />\nThe microfilm itself is carted away by night to the<br />\ncomputers in the floors below. There it is recorded<br />\non magnetic tape. In this way the library will be able<br />\nto post printouts of all books in circulation where anyone can easily see if the book he's looking for is<br />\nchecked out.<br />\nOperations Research<br />\nThis illustrates just one use the library intends to<br />\nmake of computers. In addition, the whole card<br />\ncatalogue will be placed on tape. Future and more extensive use of the computer in library management is<br />\nactively being studied by a committee on Operations<br />\nResearch headed by Dean Roy.<br />\nThe new library will be of national interest with its<br />\nproposed investigations in this area. Such things as<br />\nputting the public card catalogue on tape so that a<br />\nspecific book or a whole subject heading may be<br />\nprinted out with the push of a button may not be too<br />\nfar in the future.

They have to write something and sometimes don't know where to begin. Well,<br />\nI'm that beginning.\"<br />\nHer work at present has been more than normally<br />\ncomplicated, by the moving of the books into the new<br />\nlibrary from the main library and the many smaller<br />\nlibraries. A system worked out for getting books out<br />\nof the new library during the shuffle actually loses<br />\nthe books for a while. Getting them to the students<br />\nin the midst of this will probably continue, she<br />\nestimates, for some time although the last date given<br />\nfor being in the new building was November 7.<br />\nMiss Hubbard first came to Hopkins in 1930 as an<br />\nassistant in the Ordering Department. When she returned from her study at the Pratt Institute in 1937,<br />\nshe was put in the main reading room and has<br />\nworked there since.<br />\nThe shift to the more complex but less \"personalized\" job of heading the bibliographic section arouses<br />\nonly small fears. Said she, \"I'm a little bit afraid the<br />\nnew set-up might be somewhat less personal than my<br />\nwork now. But once you get two people together, even<br />\ninside it, I think things will be all right.\"<br />\nAccompanying Miss Hubbard to the new library will<br />\nbe the newest of the three main reading room advisors,<br />\nMrs. Joseph Lapides. Attendant at Hopkins for over a<br />\nmonth now, Mrs. Lapides too works on the bibliographic files of the library.<br />\nThe shift to the new library will only continue Miss<br />\nHubbard's past work. Said she, in looking over the<br />\nyears, \"It's been a great career and I've loved it.

As in past years,<br />\nthe radio outfit remained the largest active student organization with 70 undergraduates participating in positions ranging from disc jockeys to<br />\ntechnicians<br />\nThe campus network began operations in 1952<br />\nin a site in Ames Hall. It presently has its studio<br />\nin the basement of the Alumni Memorial Residences. Since its inception in '52, the station has<br />\nbeen beset by financial difficulties with this year<br />\nproving no exception. During the summer, a returning member decided to improve the technical<br />\nfacilities and subsequently installed a new control panel. The installation, however, exceeded the<br />\nstation's maximum budget by $300. The board of<br />\ncontrol is still reeling from that blow (which<br />\nhas been resolved by obtaining the most advertising since 1955.)<br />\nMakes Official Tapes<br />\nWJHU has made an active effort so far this<br />\nsemester to expand its services. It has been designated by COSE to make the official tapes of<br />\nall major speeches presented on campus and,<br />\naccording to station manager Wolff, will present<br />\nits complete file of past speeches to the new<br />\ncampus library. In addition, the station will also<br />\ntape all the speeches in the current special freshman series and will rebroadcast them at regular<br />\nintervals.<br /><br />\nfeel that the free publicity we provide for their<br />\nreleases is worth the small investment. This year,<br />\nwe have gotten mostly folk albums, although the<br />\nmajority of the records in our library are classical.\"<br />\nAlthough the station has a fine collection of<br />\nclassical recordings, most potential DJ.'s request<br />\nrock and roll shows. If nothing else, the latter<br />\nshows can boast the most imaginative names and<br />\nformats, with names including \"The Louie, Louie<br />\nShow,\" and \"Pandora's Box,\" \"B.J. the D.J.\" In<br />\ngeneral programming schedule places the rock and<br />\nroll shows on first (6:00 P.M.) with the music<br />\ntype become more subdued as the evening goes on.<br />\nMaintains Professional Level<br />\n\"At the beginning,\" Wolff commented, \"we<br />\ntried to set quotas to provide a balance in programming, but we have found that most aspiring<br />\nDJ's do not want to play classical. Consequently,<br />\nalthough we seek diversification, our main concern is to maintain as professional a level as<br />\npossible in broadcasting. We have also attempted<br />\nto eliminate obscenity on the shows.<br />\nAside from the ever-present fmancial problems,<br />\nWJHU is hampered primarily by an inexperienced<br />\nstaff and by insufficient broadcasting range. Its<br />\nstaff is composed almost entirely of dormitory<br />\nupperclassmen and freshmen (50) with only<br />\nsix members living off-campus. The inexperience<br />\nproblem arises from the fact that only about five<br />\nof the seventy active members have ever worked<br />\nprofessionally on other stations.<br /><br />\nThe station had planned to cover the last two<br />\naway football games from Swarthmore (November<br />\n7). and Western Maryland (November 21)<br />\nHowever, the feasibility of doing such broadcasts depends on the stabilization of the financial<br />\nsituation.

Ground was<br />\nbroken for the 4.5 million dollar building in June<br />\n1962. All funds have come from private and corporate<br />\ndonors.<br />\nThe library was designed to give both the present<br />\nlibrary system much needed space and to implement<br />\nthe University's research activities in the humanities,<br />\nsciences and social sciences. Placed in what Hopkins<br />\nlibrarian John H. Berthel considers a \"central\" location, it is easily accessible from either the dorms,<br />\nGilman Hall, or the other buildings of Keyser and<br />\nWyman quads. The new building will be ready for<br />\nuse in a few days. It will have hours of 8 a.m. to<br />\nmidnight.<br />\nUnity Maintained<br />\nOf the library's six stories, each close to football<br />\nfield length, four and one-half have been placed below ground. This maintains the architectural unity<br />\nof the campus which is patterned after the two-story<br />\nGeorgian design of Homewood House.<br />\nAs one enters the new library from Keyser Quadrangle he sees the exhibition and display gallery of<br />\nthe building's top floor. A lounge-lecture room, highfidelity record and F. M. equipment, and a staff<br />\nlounge, as well as the library's administrative offices<br />\nare also located on this floor.<br />\nCentral Chandelier<br />\nWide staircases lead around a large, circular chandelier to the floor below. The main entrance, from<br />\nCharles Street, joins these stairs about half-way<br />\ndown. Together a single, broad stairway then leads<br />\nonto the main floor.<br />\nThe circulation desk, a book checker, and the<br />\nunion catalogue are located around this central foyer.<br />\nTo the north on the main floor and behind the cir-<br /><br />\nculation desk is the main technical services area of<br />\nthe library. Here books will be catalogued and prepared for the shelves. A service elevator and stairs<br />\nalso connect this part of the building with the floors<br />\nbelow.<br />\nPublic Elevators<br /><br />\nTo the south is located the Documents Reading<br />\nRoom and the Valuable Books Reading Room. Two<br />\npublic elevators, located to the left of the corridor,<br />\ndescend to the floors below. Further down and separated by the main corridor is the Humanities-Social<br />\nSciences Reference and Reading Rooms on the right<br />\nand the Science Engineering facility of a similar design on the left.<br />\nEach of these reference rooms will have a seating<br />\ncapacity of 50 persons and is closely connected to an<br />\nopen lounge at the extreme south end of the floor. The<br />\nlounge itself opens onto a sun porch that may be utilized during periods of good weather.<br />\nOn the floor below, designated Stack Level A, current periodicals will be kept. A Periodicals Reading<br />\nLounge lies directly under the open air terrace on the<br />\nfloor and, close by, is space for 10,000 individual periodicals. At present only half that number will be displayed.<br />\nEnclosed Items<br />\nValuable book stacks, enveloped by wire cages, will<br />\nalso be stored on this floor with a separate stairway<br />\nentering them from the Valuable Books Reading<br />\nRoom overhead. Selected Special Collections will also<br />\nbe placed in these enclosed stacks.<br />\nThe campus photo-duplicating laboratory, a bindery<br />\nfor the maintenance of the library's books, a loading<br />\ndock, a receiving room, and unsorted book storage<br />\nstacks will also grace this level. A map room, housing<br />\nthe University's map collection, janitorial and maintenance areas, the Audio-Visual Department, and the<br />\nFine Arts stacks complete the floor. The audio-visual<br />\narea will include the University's collection of records<br />\nand equipment upon which to play them. The Fine<br />\nArts area includes a seminar room, office space, a<br />\nslide storage, and an art vault.<br /><br />\nStack Level B, the floor below, will house the<br />\nDocuments Library stacks. The core of the library,<br />\nmiles of gorgeous open stacks, starts in<br />\nearnest on<br />\nthis floor. Interlaced with the stacks are<br />\nnumerous<br />\nstudent carrels with individual storage<br />\ncages above<br />\nthem. Along the walls are private studies,<br />\neach containing a desk, file cabinets, space for a<br />\nportable<br />\ntypewriter, and separate thermostats.<br />\nThese are<br />\nprimarily for faculty members and advanced<br />\ngraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThere are also two seminar rooms<br />\nand three typing areas (available for noisier \"bull\"<br />\nsessions should<br />\nthe need for a soundproof room arise).<br />\nThe south<br />\nend of this floor, as on all the floors above<br />\nand below, is a lounge and reading area. This end<br />\nis the<br />\nonly part of the library that remains above<br />\nground<br />\nthroughout the building, and students acquiring<br />\nclaustrophobia or other ailments in the depths of the<br />\nstacks are urged to use the lounge as an<br />\n\"escape<br />\nhatch.\"<br />\nComputer Space<br />\nStack levels C and D contain more free-stand<br />\ning<br />\nstacks, student carrels, studies, typing and<br />\nseminar<br />\nrooms. Furthermore, the north and northeast<br />\nsections of the bottom floor (Level D) will<br />\nhouse the<br />\nHomewood Campus's computers. This is perhaps<br />\nthe<br />\nmost novel feature of the library. A sacrifice of<br />\n4,300<br />\nsquare feet of floor space to the computers is considered well worth the price. Both the library<br />\nitself,<br />\nwith its interest in Operations Research, and departments throughout the Campus will benefit from this<br />\ncentralization. In addition Homewood, the Medical<br />\nSchools, and the Applied Physics Laboratory will all<br />\nhave their computers connected by special wiring<br />\nlinks.<br />\nIn summing up the new building, librarian Berthel<br />\nemphasized that it should not be considered<br />\nparticularly revolutionary in design, but rather, a reflection<br />\non the current fashions in library planning. \"I'm<br />\nexcited about it,\" he said, \"but this is not a unique<br />\nor utopian arrangement. I hope it's as good as<br />\nwe<br />\nthink it is.\"<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE NOVEMBER 6, 1964<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE THREE<br /><br />\nArt<br />\nWorks by Rembrandt, Picasso, and Van Dyke will<br />\nbe among those displayed in an art exhibit in the<br />\nnorth and south galleries of the new library starting<br />\nSaturday and lasting until Nov. 15.<br /><br />\nthe exhibit will be a Norman Rockwell portrait of<br />\nDwight D. Eisenhower, donated by University president, Milton S. Eisenhower. Dr. Eisenhower is also<br />\ndonating a work by Diego Rivera, the celebrated Mexican muralist.<br />\nAmong the many works of interest, Dr. Rearick<br />\npoints out the three illuminated manuscripts donated<br />\nby Dr. Bober, visiting Professor of Humanities, from<br />\nN.Y.U. These are of the Beauvals school, and date<br />\nback to the thirteenth century. A handsome bronze by<br />\nthe Venetian, Tiziano Aspetti will also be displayed,<br />\ndonated by Dr. Truesdel. These works, along with all<br />\nothers of the pre-twentieth century category will be<br />\ndisplayed in the North gallery.<br />\nThe modern works will be displayed in the South<br />\ngallery, and will include works by Picasso, Lautrec,<br /><br />\nDr. W. R. Rearick, of the Art Department organized<br />\nthe exhibit, which is composed of works taken from<br />\ncollections of the faculty of both the Hospital and<br />\nHomewood. Dr. Rearick said that the exhibit is the<br />\nfirst of its kind at Hopkins, and that if successful, may<br />\nbe the forerunner of others.<br />\nThe exhibit reflects, in Dr. Rearick's words, the<br />\n\"very good taste\" of the faculty, and is composed of<br />\nMainly contemporary works. Only two or three have<br />\never been exhibited to the public before.<br />\nDr. Rearick predicts that the most popular work in<br /><br />\nand Rodin. Dr. Rearick also points out that there will<br />\nbe a generous display of works by artists from the<br />\nBaltimore area.<br />\nThe exhibit has taken several weeks to prepare,<br />\nwith the actual collection of works the most difficult<br />\ntask. Dr. Rearick points out that a great many of the<br />\nfaculty collect art, more so than at many other schools,<br />\nand that his biggest problem was finding out who had<br />\nwhat works to loan.<br />\nWhen asked about the future of the library as an<br />\nexhibition hall, Dr. Rearick said that there were no<br />\ndefinite plans as yet, but that it is hoped that a<br />\npermanent collection might be established by donations to the University. At the South end of the<br />\nbuilding is a sculpture court, and in time enough<br />\nsculpture to make it worthwhile is expected to be donated.<br /><br />\nArchitecture<br />\nThe new library was designed so that it would<br />\nbe unobtrusive to the rest of the architecture<br />\nIn Keyster Quadrangle. Only one and a half<br />\nstories rise above the quadrangle level allowing Gilman Hall to remain the dominant edifice on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nFrom the east the tower of Gilman appears to<br />\nrise from the roof of the library as if it were an<br />\nappendage. The large glass area opening on to Charles<br />\nStreet permits a view of Gilman through the library.<br />\nThe building was designed by the two Baltimore<br />\narchitectural firms of Wrenn, Lewis, and Jencks; and<br />\nMeyer and Ayers.<br />\nThe architects found a solution to the problem<br />\nOf building a hugh structure on campus, without offsetting the apparent architectural unity, by placing<br />\nMuch of the building under ground.<br />\nThe library descends five stories below ground<br />\nWith area on each level about the size of a football<br />\nfield. There is room for over 1,500,000 books and research facilities such as visual aids and phonographs.<br />\nThe lower levels of the library were constructed<br />\nUsing metal pan construction. Cement, in this process,<br /><br />\nIs poured over inverted pans. When the cement<br />\nhardens the pans are removed from below giving<br />\nthe ceilings a waffled terrain. The advantage of this<br />\nconstruction method is that it permits the strength<br />\nof very thick floors while allowing weight to be<br />\nreduced.<br />\nThe first floor of the library opens into the<br />\nquad level with walls rising two and a half stories.<br />\nStairs surround this open area permitting access to<br />\neach floor.<br />\nThe quadrangle level halls will serve as a gallery<br />\nto permit a picturesque entryway at the west. Also<br />\non this level will be the library administrative offices<br />\nand reception rooms with adjoining kitchens.<br />\nAs the structure under ground exceeds in area<br />\nthe part of the building that rises above quad level,<br />\nthe roof of the lower floors provides a large patio<br />\nat the quadrangle. At the south of the library, on<br />\nthe patio, is a large square hole opening into the<br />\nfirst floor to permit light to enter the reference areas.<br />\nThe whole south end of the library opens into<br />\na semibowled garden so as to permit light into the<br /><br />\n.....<br /><br />\nlounging areas. The rest of the lower levels is artificially lit.<br />\nAn overall view of the building from Charles<br />\nStreet shows it adjacent to Homewood House, the oldest building on campus and one of the finest examples<br />\nof English Colonial architecture in the world. Although the new building, constructed 165 years after<br />\nHomewood House, bears much of the same attendant<br />\ndecorative features, the two buildings are very much<br />\ndissimilar.<br />\nThe gently sloping roof and dormers have been<br />\nreplaced by a flat roof. The round columns and stairway have been replaced by square pilasters and<br />\nwalkway.<br />\nThe new library deviates from the design of<br />\nHomewood House more than any other building on<br />\ncampus, yet it does not completely reject the architectural principles of that structure.

No federal or state<br />\nfunds were used.<br />\nIn 1958 the University and the Hospital announced<br />\na ten year development program. Of the four top<br />\npriority items, one was a new library on the Homewood Campus.<br />\nOn January 9, 1961 the Board of Trustees, at the<br />\nrequest of Dr. Eisenhower, gave highest place to<br />\nthe raising of funds for the library. To instigate<br />\nthis they accepted President Eisenhower's recommendation that one million dollars from the University's<br />\nFord grant be placed in the fund. In addition, the<br />\nTrustees themselves each contributed to the fund. All<br />\nthis underscored the extreme importance the University placed on building the library.<br />\nClose Finish<br />\nWith only 2.5 million of the total sum required<br />\nthe contract was let for the building. This unprecedented move permitted the building to be completed<br />\nless than six months after June 1964, the month the<br />\nmoney was finally raised.<br />\nInstrumental in the fund raising was Albert Hutzler, a Trustee and chairman of the Trustee Building<br />\nCommittee when the library was planned. He has been<br />\na donor to the Hopkins library for many years and a<br />\npast President of the Friends of the Library.<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br />\nAnother Trustee, Eli Frank, Jr.. was chairman of<br />\nthe Library Campaign Committee.

Instead, he will now be issued a<br />\nlibrary card of some sort which he merely places on<br />\ntop of the book(s) he wishes to check out. The combination will be microfilmed (ID plus the books spine<br />\nand front cover) at the circulation desk. Then a stamp<br />\nwith the date due will be stuck on the book. The student may now safely pass through the checker's portals. Furthermore, should anyone try removing the<br />\nsticker and placing it on another book it mysteriously<br />\nchanges color for all to see.<br />\nThe microfilm itself is carted away by night to the<br />\ncomputers in the floors below. There it is recorded<br />\non magnetic tape. In this way the library will be able<br />\nto post printouts of all books in circulation where anyone can easily see if the book he's looking for is<br />\nchecked out.<br />\nOperations Research<br />\nThis illustrates just one use the library intends to<br />\nmake of computers. In addition, the whole card<br />\ncatalogue will be placed on tape. Future and more extensive use of the computer in library management is<br />\nactively being studied by a committee on Operations<br />\nResearch headed by Dean Roy.<br />\nThe new library will be of national interest with its<br />\nproposed investigations in this area. Such things as<br />\nputting the public card catalogue on tape so that a<br />\nspecific book or a whole subject heading may be<br />\nprinted out with the push of a button may not be too<br />\nfar in the future.

They have to write something and sometimes don't know where to begin. Well,<br />\nI'm that beginning.\"<br />\nHer work at present has been more than normally<br />\ncomplicated, by the moving of the books into the new<br />\nlibrary from the main library and the many smaller<br />\nlibraries. A system worked out for getting books out<br />\nof the new library during the shuffle actually loses<br />\nthe books for a while. Getting them to the students<br />\nin the midst of this will probably continue, she<br />\nestimates, for some time although the last date given<br />\nfor being in the new building was November 7.<br />\nMiss Hubbard first came to Hopkins in 1930 as an<br />\nassistant in the Ordering Department. When she returned from her study at the Pratt Institute in 1937,<br />\nshe was put in the main reading room and has<br />\nworked there since.<br />\nThe shift to the more complex but less \"personalized\" job of heading the bibliographic section arouses<br />\nonly small fears. Said she, \"I'm a little bit afraid the<br />\nnew set-up might be somewhat less personal than my<br />\nwork now. But once you get two people together, even<br />\ninside it, I think things will be all right.\"<br />\nAccompanying Miss Hubbard to the new library will<br />\nbe the newest of the three main reading room advisors,<br />\nMrs. Joseph Lapides. Attendant at Hopkins for over a<br />\nmonth now, Mrs. Lapides too works on the bibliographic files of the library.<br />\nThe shift to the new library will only continue Miss<br />\nHubbard's past work. Said she, in looking over the<br />\nyears, \"It's been a great career and I've loved it.
