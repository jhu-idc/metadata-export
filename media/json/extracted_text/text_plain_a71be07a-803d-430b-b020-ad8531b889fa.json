The Council must integrate<br />\nthe class presidents by giving<br />\nthem a vote.<br />\n2.

He was<br />\nasked to define his terms, such<br />\nas celebration and was challenged on the value of a new<br />\njargon which would just replace<br />\nthe old. Greenwich Village jargon, it was said, would be just as<br />\nrestrictive as the present terminology. Reverend Moody maintained that you don't have to<br />\ntell people what they are celebrating. They just celebrate from<br />\ntheir own emotions of life, be it<br />\na joyous or tragic celebration.<br />\nThe new jargon, he asserted, is<br />\nthe jargon of the 20th century<br />\nand concerns itself with the<br />\nProblems of the modern world.<br />\nThe Church is going to have to<br />\nShed its self-conscious theological sermonizing, he declared, and<br />\nis going to be forced to talk about<br />\nreality.

He pointed to the example<br />\n<br />\nof the prophets who chastized<br />\nthe people for making animal<br />\nsacrifices and ignoring the sufferings of the people. He said<br />\nthat it was not sufficient to dress<br />\nsomething up with ritual and<br />\ncall it divine. A special language<br />\nIs not needed.<br />\nReverend Moody also stated<br />\nthat he did not want to cut the<br />\npast off from the present, but<br />\nthat it was necessary to go back<br />\nto the roots of a custom and<br />\nfind its original purpose to see<br />\nhow it can be meaningful now.<br />\nHe concluded by stating that an<br />\n<br />\nimportant innovation was the<br />\nstripping down of the Church's<br />\nstructure so that structure and<br />\norganization would not prevent<br />\nthe Church from acting.

Some contend that if a student's intellect is sufficiently aroused, happiness will automatically<br />\nfollow. Others say that to concentrate on the intellect and<br />\nignore the rest of the personality can only lead to misery.<br />\nI myself favor the second view, and I offer in evidence<br />\nthe well-known case of Knut Fusco.<br />\nKnut, a forestry major, never got anything less than a<br />\nstraight \"A,\" was awarded his B.T. (Bachelor of Trees) in<br />\nonly two years, his M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in<br />\nonly three,and his D.B.C.(Doctor of Blight and Cutworms)<br />\nin only four.<br />\nAcademic glory was his. His intellect was the envy of<br />\nevery intellect fan on campus. But was he happy? The answer, alas, was no. Knut\u2014he knew not why\u2014was miserable; so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking<br />\nacross campus, he was suddenly so overcome with melancholy that he flung himself, weeping, upon the statue of the<br />\nFounder.<br />\nBy and by,a liberal arts coed named Nikki Sigafoos came<br />\nby with her Barby doll. She noted Knut's condition. \"How<br />\ncome you're so unhappy, hey?\" said Nikki.<br />\n\"Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,\"<br />\nreplied Knut peevishly.<br />\n\"All right, I will,\" said Nikki.\"You are unhappy for two<br />\nreasons.

They just celebrate from<br />\ntheir own emotions of life, be it<br />\na joyous or tragic celebration.<br />\nThe new jargon, he asserted, is<br />\nthe jargon of the 20th century<br />\nand concerns itself with the<br />\nProblems of the modern world.<br />\nThe Church is going to have to<br />\nShed its self-conscious theological sermonizing, he declared, and<br />\nis going to be forced to talk about<br />\nreality. No matter how important<br />\n\"redemption\" is to us, he added,<br />\nmeans<br />\nGreen<br />\n'redemption<br />\nStamps to most people.\" He also<br />\naaid that there was nothing<br />\nstrange or restrictive about the<br />\nlanguage of the Village since its<br />\nPeople come from all over the<br />\nCountry and he was not referring<br />\nto any beat type language.<br />\nCatholic Opinion<br />\nA Roman Catholic stated that<br />\nthe service was, for him, a<br />\ncommunication with God and he<br />\ncould not accept the Reverend's<br />\ndefinition of it as a ritualized<br />\nCult, The Reverend answered<br />\nthat this was hard for both<br />\nCatholics and Protestants to accept, although harder for Catholics. He pointed to the example<br /><br />\nof the prophets who chastized<br />\nthe people for making animal<br />\nsacrifices and ignoring the sufferings of the people. He said<br />\nthat it was not sufficient to dress<br />\nsomething up with ritual and<br />\ncall it divine. A special language<br />\nIs not needed.<br />\nReverend Moody also stated<br />\nthat he did not want to cut the<br />\npast off from the present, but<br />\nthat it was necessary to go back<br />\nto the roots of a custom and<br />\nfind its original purpose to see<br />\nhow it can be meaningful now.<br />\nHe concluded by stating that an<br /><br />\nimportant innovation was the<br />\nstripping down of the Church's<br />\nstructure so that structure and<br />\norganization would not prevent<br />\nthe Church from acting. In the<br />\nmodern world, he said, the<br />\nChurch must be dynamic and<br />\nable to react quickly in a situation.<br />\nAfter the lecture, interested<br />\npeople were invited to buy their<br />\ndinner in the Levering Hall cafeteria and then attend a discussion and dinner in the Sherwood<br />\nRoom.<br /><br />\nRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxItstRxRxRxRxRxRxRx<br /><br />\nCOMPLETE SELECTION OF<br />\nCHRISTMAS GIFTS<br />\nCards\u2014Candy\u2014Cosmetics\u2014Lotions<br /><br />\n1.4<br /><br />\nFree gift wrapping and mailing<br /><br />\n04<br /><br />\nGREENWAY PHARMACY<br />\nCharles and 34th St.<br /><br />\n04<br /><br />\nBE 5-5830<br /><br />\nRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxitxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxRxItxRxRx<br /><br />\nCHEMICAL ENGINEERS:<br />\nEver Consider a Career in Air Pollution<br />\nControl Engineering?<br />\nYou will:<br />\n\u2022 Be involved in one of the fastest growing fields of engineering.<br />\n\u2022 Deal directly with all types of industry in locating sources<br />\nor air pollution and providing consultation on remedial<br />\nmeasures.<br />\n\u2022 Be given extensive on-the-job training.<br />\n\u2022 Have the opportunity to get a Masters in environmental<br />\nengineering or public health.<br />\n\u2022 Have opportunities for advancement.<br />\nFor farther information, call or write today:<br /><br />\nB.

Some contend that if a student's intellect is sufficiently aroused, happiness will automatically<br />\nfollow. Others say that to concentrate on the intellect and<br />\nignore the rest of the personality can only lead to misery.<br />\nI myself favor the second view, and I offer in evidence<br />\nthe well-known case of Knut Fusco.<br />\nKnut, a forestry major, never got anything less than a<br />\nstraight \"A,\" was awarded his B.T. (Bachelor of Trees) in<br />\nonly two years, his M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in<br />\nonly three,and his D.B.C.(Doctor of Blight and Cutworms)<br />\nin only four.<br />\nAcademic glory was his. His intellect was the envy of<br />\nevery intellect fan on campus. But was he happy? The answer, alas, was no. Knut\u2014he knew not why\u2014was miserable; so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking<br />\nacross campus, he was suddenly so overcome with melancholy that he flung himself, weeping, upon the statue of the<br />\nFounder.<br />\nBy and by,a liberal arts coed named Nikki Sigafoos came<br />\nby with her Barby doll. She noted Knut's condition. \"How<br />\ncome you're so unhappy, hey?\" said Nikki.<br />\n\"Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,\"<br />\nreplied Knut peevishly.<br />\n\"All right, I will,\" said Nikki.\"You are unhappy for two<br />\nreasons. First, because you have been so busy stuffing your<br />\nintellect that you have gone and starved your psyche.<br />\nI've got nothing<br />\nagainst learning,<br />\nmind you, but a person oughtn't to neglect the pleasant,<br />\ngentle amenities of<br />\nlife\u2014the fun things.<br />\nHave you, for instance, ever been to<br />\na dance?\"<br />\nKnut shook his<br />\nhead.<br />\n\"Have you ever \"<br />\n...and then to a justice of the peace.*<br />\nwatched a sunset?<br />\nWritten a poem? Shaved with a Personna Stainless Steel<br />\nBlade?\"<br />\nKnut shook his head.<br />\n\"Well, we'll fix that right, now,\"said Nikki,and gave him<br />\na razor, a Personna Stainless Steel Blade, and a can of<br />\nBurma Shave.<br />\nKnut lathered with the Burma Shave and shaved with<br />\nthe Personna and for the first time in many long years he<br />\nsmiled. He smiled and then he laughed\u2014peal after peal of<br />\nreverberating joy. \"Wow-dow!\" he cried. \"What a shave!<br />\nDoes Personna come in injector style, too?\"<br />\n\"It does,\" said Nikki.<br />\n\"Gloriosky!\" cried Knut.\"And does Burma Shave come<br />\nIn menthol, too?\"<br />\n\"It does,\" said Nikki.<br />\n\"Huzzah!\"cried Knut.\"Now that I have found Personna<br />\nand Burma Shave I will never have another unhappy day.\"<br />\n\"Hold!\" said Nikki. \"Personna and Burma Shave alone<br />\nwill not solve your problem\u2014only half of it. Remember I<br />\nsaid there were two things making you unhappy?\"<br />\n\"Oh, yeah,\"said Knut.\"What's the other one?\"<br />\n\"How long have you had that bear trap on your foot?\"<br />\nsaid Nikki.<br />\n\"I stepped on it during a field trip in my freshman year,\",<br />\nsaid Knut.\"I keep meaning to have it taken off.\"<br />\n\"Allow me,\"said Nikki and removed it.<br />\n\"Land's sakes, what a relief!\" said Knut, now totally<br />\nhappy, and took Nikki's hand and led her to a Personna<br />\nvendor and then to a justice of the peace.<br />\nToday Knut is a perfectly fulfilled man, both intellect.<br />\nwise and personalitywise. He lives in a charming split-level<br />\nhouse with Nikki and their 17 children and he rises steadily<br />\nin the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, he becalm*<br />\nConsultant on Sawdust to the American Butchers Guild,<br />\nhe was named an Honorary Sequoia by the park commis-,<br />\nsioner of Las Vegas, and he published a beet-selling boob;<br />\ncalled .1 Was a Slippery Elm for the FBI.<br />\n0 1465.
