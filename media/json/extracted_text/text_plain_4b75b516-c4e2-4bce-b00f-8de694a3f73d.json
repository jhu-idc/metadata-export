A recent symposium on the subject<br />\nsharply criticized the doctors and parents, as well as<br />\ncondemning society for not providing an adequate legal<br />\nframework for such cases. The symposium justly<br />\nconcluded, \"Physicians are inadequately educated with<br />\nrespect to the social and moral implications of decisions<br />\nthat they are called upon to make.\" Emerging from all this<br />\ncontroversy is the need for clarification of the responsibilities of doctors and for changes in the law.<br />\nBasically, it would seem that no doctor or parent or<br />\nsociety should have the right to kill a living human being.<br />\nYet doctors are placed in deep legal trouble if they perform life-saving operations. without consent, and .a valid<br />\npoint can perhaps be made for families who wish to spare a<br />\ndefective child a life of misery.

With new legislation he<br />\nhoped not only that one million more students<br />\nwould receive aid but also that federal funds<br />\nwould go first, and in the largest amounts, to the<br />\nneediest students. Unfortunately \"The Higher<br />\nEducation Act of 1971,\" H.R. 7248, as reported<br />\nout by the House Education and Labor<br />\nCommittee varies considerably from this<br />\nphilosophy. Representative Albert Quie (R-Minn)<br />\nand others have proposed an amendment to this<br />\nbill which would ensure that lower income<br />\nstudents retain first access to federal grants.<br />\nUnder H.R. 7248 a state allotment formula<br />\n,<br />\nunrelated to the number of needy students<br />\n,<br />\nwould result in inequitable distribution of<br />\nmoney, favoring some states over others. Quies\u2022<br />\nproposal provides that Educational Opportunity<br />\nGrants be assigned directly to the student<br />\nwherever he decides to attend college. The<br />\ncommittee's bill allows each financial aid director<br />\nto determine the contribution each student'<br />\ns<br />\nfamily could make, whereas the new proposal<br />\nBill Henderson is a senior and President ofHopkins<br />\nYoung Republicans.<br />\n<br />\nHenderson<br />\n<br />\nwould require each school to use the same<br />\nmethod of determining the contribution.<br />\nThe new proposal is also more realistic,<br />\nfinancially speaking. It provides for a maximum<br />\nof $5,600 in four years for each student and<br />\nauthorizes \"such sums as may be necessary\"<br />\n(estimated to be $500 million the first year). The<br />\nbill sets a maximum of $4,000 per student for<br />\nfour years and authorizes only $295 million for<br />\nfiscal 1973. Furthermore, H.R. 7248 requires the<br />\nstudent to complete every year for his grant. The<br />\nnew proposal, however, would guarantee the<br />\nEducational Opportunity Grant if he continues<br />\nto qualify under the formula.<br />\nRepresentative Quie, with the support of a<br />\nscore of educational groups\u2014from the College<br />\nEntrance Examination Board to the National<br />\nStudent Association\u2014is soliciting support among<br />\ncollege students. According to Mr. Quie, \"The<br />\nmost emotional issue Congress faced this year in<br />\nthe area of higher education centered on<br />\ninstitutional grants, but no one stood up for<br />\nstudents.\" It is hoped that students will make<br />\ntheir views known by writing to their<br />\nCongressmen and sending copies to<br />\nRepresentative Quie for possible publication in<br />\nthe Congressional Record.<br />\n<br />\n\fOctober 26, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nFlying Burrito brothers<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nFrom the riffs between songs,<br />\nit sounded very much like their<br />\nlast concert, and the few<br />\nhundred people who endured<br />\nthe discomforts of the<br />\ngymnasium out on Wilkens<br />\nAvenue might have seen an event<br />\nof some historical importance in<br />\nthe world of rock.<br />\nNot that too many of them<br />\nbothered to listen, they were too<br />\nbusy getting drunk and/or<br />\nstoned and dancing around<br />\nhaving a good time, perhaps<br />\nforgetting that the country<br />\nmusic the Flying Burrito<br />\nBrothers were producing on<br />\nstage was foot-tapping music to<br />\nbe bathed in as you rock in a<br />\nswing on your front porch or<br />\ngaze down the interstate and<br />\nwonder how many hours until<br />\nYou can stop.<br />\nBut, the dancers may have<br />\nbeen confused by the lack light<br />\nPosters and the psychedelic<br />\nlights that flashed a continuous<br />\nnon -sequitur behind Chris<br />\nHillman's head.

In addition<br />\nto their five regular members,<br />\nincluding a new steel guitarist<br />\nreplacing Sneeky Pete, they had<br />\ntwo members of a west-coast<br />\nbluegrass band called Country<br />\nGazette, and ex-Byrd Gram<br />\nParsons, who quit the Burritos<br />\nover a year ago because of \"a<br />\ncycle accident and other<br />\nproblems,\" according to their<br />\nPR release. Those \"other<br />\nproblems\" became evident when<br />\nParsons began nodding out over<br />\nthe microphone. Though he had<br />\ntrouble playing the guitar and<br />\nsinging at the same time, his<br />\nvoice was beautiful, especially<br />\non \"Wild Horses,\" the Stones'<br />\nsong the Burritos recorded on<br />\ntheir second album. At the end<br />\nof the evening Chris Hillman, the<br />\nfounder and obvious leader of<br />\nthe group, called the concert a<br />\n\"Burrito Memorial.\" The<br />\nex-Byrd bass player said nothing<br />\nfurther, so we'll just have to read<br />\nabout it in Rolling Stone.<br />\nMeanwhile, the music was<br />\ngood. The Burritos did some of<br />\ntheir favorites, like Merle<br />\nHaggard's \"White Line Fever,\"<br />\nand \"Colorado,\" the latter sung<br />\nby Rick Roberts, Gram Parsons<br />\nerstwhile replacement, whose<br />\naddition to the group added a<br />\nfolksy lyrical side.

Towards the end<br />\nthey started having a good time<br />\nalong with the dancers, doing<br />\n\"Dream Baby,\" and an old Elvis<br />\n<br />\nsong, \"Honey,Honey.\" They<br />\nclosed with an instrumental, a<br />\nshort break from everyone, and<br />\nthen a quick exit.

An archaic state law permitted the<br />\nparents to retain custody of the unwanted children and let<br />\nthem refuse doctors the chance to perform surgery for a<br />\ndigestive defect. A recent symposium on the subject<br />\nsharply criticized the doctors and parents, as well as<br />\ncondemning society for not providing an adequate legal<br />\nframework for such cases. The symposium justly<br />\nconcluded, \"Physicians are inadequately educated with<br />\nrespect to the social and moral implications of decisions<br />\nthat they are called upon to make.\" Emerging from all this<br />\ncontroversy is the need for clarification of the responsibilities of doctors and for changes in the law.<br />\nBasically, it would seem that no doctor or parent or<br />\nsociety should have the right to kill a living human being.<br />\nYet doctors are placed in deep legal trouble if they perform life-saving operations. without consent, and .a valid<br />\npoint can perhaps be made for families who wish to spare a<br />\ndefective child a life of misery. Nevertheless, the emphasis<br />\nin this controversial area should be on preserving human<br />\nlife and widening the options available to all those concerned. Furthermore, families would not be so reluctant to<br />\nlet their babies survive if society provided meaningful<br />\ntreatment and care for deformed children.<br /><br />\nStudent Council<br />\nThe Student Council has reached the point where undergraduates can no longer passively regard the group as a<br />\nmeaningless joke or the source of entertaining News-Letter<br />\narticles.

In addition to<br />\nthe general fiasco that meetings have become, SC President<br />\nGerry Bates has assumed a position which he characterizes<br />\nas \"baby-sitting\" but which can more appropriately be<br />\ntermed autocracy.<br />\nBates regards the Council members as \"immature,\" and<br />\nthat attitude is reflected in his dealings with the group.<br />\nHaving failed to exercise the control necessary for the<br />\ngroup to function effectively, Bates has turned instead to<br />\na<br />\nsystem of by-passing members and attempting to<br />\ndown-play the ineptitude of the group.<br />\nBates made an unsuccessful attempt to kill<br />\nthe<br />\nNews-Letter article reporting Monday's fiasco not<br />\nbecause<br />\nthe story was incorrect but because \"articles about the<br />\nmeetings serve to create and perpetuate dissent among the<br />\nCouncil members.\" Ignoring the problems because reporting them causes disruption of the Council is twisted logic<br />\nindeed.<br />\nThe Council has habitually dissolved into little more<br />\nthan personality conflicts where undergraduate \"leaders,\"<br />\negos flashing, have made a mockery of the undergraduate<br />\nposition at Hopkins. If undergraduate status is ever to improve, we must assume there is a better way.<br />\nPerhaps the formation of a true University Senate,<br />\ncomprised of members from throughout the University<br />\ncommunity, will serve to install some degree of purpose<br />\nand direction to the representatives of the undergraduates.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWomen at Hopkins are part of<br />\nthe Great Silent Minority. The<br />\nname Johns Hopkins at first<br />\nlooked good on the records. But<br />\nlife here is not easy.

But, for example, one boy<br />\nmentioned that dating a feminist<br />\nwould make him too nervous to<br />\nmake it all worthwhile(Jeez,<br />\nwho would run quicker to be the<br />\nfirst to open the door?) and<br />\nanother said his goal was to have<br />\na chick who would tell him that<br />\nhe made her \"feel like a natural<br />\nwoman.\" The news is out:<br />\nwomen's lib is outdated; girls<br />\nwho screw without questions<br />\nasked are better, especially in<br />\nlimited time. So much for my<br />\nsitting alone in my room. It's<br />\njust a question of which wins<br />\nout: the body or the mind.<br />\nFor a while, I wouldn't<br />\nbelieve all that stuff being fed to<br />\nme: girls-should-be-sexy-and-not<br />\nheard. I'd walk the length of the<br />\ncampus, searching for some<br />\nfemale faces, ready to jam a tape<br />\nrecorder into their open mouths<br />\nand ask, \"Say, friend, do you<br />\nfeel the way I do?\" But it was<br />\nhard finding the women; and<br />\nwhen I did, they were with<br />\nT-shirted fellow students with<br />\nencircling arms and ready lips.<br />\nWith such few women here, I<br />\nexpected to find a close-knit<br />\ncommunity, but no, it's not like<br /><br />\nOctober 26, 1971<br />\n\"Could You Make This Perfectly Clear?\"<br /><br />\nthat. We're not sisters, we're<br />\nrivals, enemies, each one to<br />\nherself and watch whom you<br />\ndate, kid. He's mine, you know.<br />\nGod,it was awful. One day I<br />\ntold a friend that the student<br />\nunion proposed for 1973 should<br />\nbe a massive bed. \"Great idea,\"<br />\nwas the reply.

With new legislation he<br />\nhoped not only that one million more students<br />\nwould receive aid but also that federal funds<br />\nwould go first, and in the largest amounts, to the<br />\nneediest students. Unfortunately \"The Higher<br />\nEducation Act of 1971,\" H.R. 7248, as reported<br />\nout by the House Education and Labor<br />\nCommittee varies considerably from this<br />\nphilosophy. Representative Albert Quie (R-Minn)<br />\nand others have proposed an amendment to this<br />\nbill which would ensure that lower income<br />\nstudents retain first access to federal grants.<br />\nUnder H.R. 7248 a state allotment formula<br />\n,<br />\nunrelated to the number of needy students<br />\n,<br />\nwould result in inequitable distribution of<br />\nmoney, favoring some states over others. Quies\u2022<br />\nproposal provides that Educational Opportunity<br />\nGrants be assigned directly to the student<br />\nwherever he decides to attend college. The<br />\ncommittee's bill allows each financial aid director<br />\nto determine the contribution each student'<br />\ns<br />\nfamily could make, whereas the new proposal<br />\nBill Henderson is a senior and President ofHopkins<br />\nYoung Republicans.<br /><br />\nHenderson<br /><br />\nwould require each school to use the same<br />\nmethod of determining the contribution.<br />\nThe new proposal is also more realistic,<br />\nfinancially speaking. It provides for a maximum<br />\nof $5,600 in four years for each student and<br />\nauthorizes \"such sums as may be necessary\"<br />\n(estimated to be $500 million the first year). The<br />\nbill sets a maximum of $4,000 per student for<br />\nfour years and authorizes only $295 million for<br />\nfiscal 1973. Furthermore, H.R. 7248 requires the<br />\nstudent to complete every year for his grant. The<br />\nnew proposal, however, would guarantee the<br />\nEducational Opportunity Grant if he continues<br />\nto qualify under the formula.<br />\nRepresentative Quie, with the support of a<br />\nscore of educational groups\u2014from the College<br />\nEntrance Examination Board to the National<br />\nStudent Association\u2014is soliciting support among<br />\ncollege students. According to Mr. Quie, \"The<br />\nmost emotional issue Congress faced this year in<br />\nthe area of higher education centered on<br />\ninstitutional grants, but no one stood up for<br />\nstudents.\" It is hoped that students will make<br />\ntheir views known by writing to their<br />\nCongressmen and sending copies to<br />\nRepresentative Quie for possible publication in<br />\nthe Congressional Record.<br /><br />\nOctober 26, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nFlying Burrito brothers<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nFrom the riffs between songs,<br />\nit sounded very much like their<br />\nlast concert, and the few<br />\nhundred people who endured<br />\nthe discomforts of the<br />\ngymnasium out on Wilkens<br />\nAvenue might have seen an event<br />\nof some historical importance in<br />\nthe world of rock.<br />\nNot that too many of them<br />\nbothered to listen, they were too<br />\nbusy getting drunk and/or<br />\nstoned and dancing around<br />\nhaving a good time, perhaps<br />\nforgetting that the country<br />\nmusic the Flying Burrito<br />\nBrothers were producing on<br />\nstage was foot-tapping music to<br />\nbe bathed in as you rock in a<br />\nswing on your front porch or<br />\ngaze down the interstate and<br />\nwonder how many hours until<br />\nYou can stop.<br />\nBut, the dancers may have<br />\nbeen confused by the lack light<br />\nPosters and the psychedelic<br />\nlights that flashed a continuous<br />\nnon -sequitur behind Chris<br />\nHillman's head.

Their first<br />\nalbum's country grit contrasted<br />\nWith Springfield smoothness of<br />\nPoco as they sought to bring to<br />\nthe hip world the relaxed<br />\ntogetherness and simple honesty<br />\nthat country music had brought<br />\nto so many middle-class whites<br />\nover the previous few decades.<br />\n\"White Soul\" they called it, and<br />\na few measures of Roy Acuff.<br />\nMerle Haggard or Tammy<br />\nWynette could make you a<br />\nbeliever. But the Burritos were<br />\nsinging about getting a lettei<br />\nfrom the draft board or gettinE<br />\nhassled about having long hair,<br />\nbut simple, simple.

It was this song that<br />\nprovided the few moments peace<br />\nduring Gimme Shelter's re-telling<br />\nof the Altamont debacle, and<br />\nSunday it was tight and good,<br />\nsettling us down for what was to<br />\ncome.<br />\nAfter<br />\nNear the beginning they told<br />\nus that this was the last concert<br />\non their current tour, \"and<br />\nthere'll probably be some<br />\npersonnel changes after tonight,<br />\nso welcome to our party.\" And<br />\nquite a party it was. In addition<br />\nto their five regular members,<br />\nincluding a new steel guitarist<br />\nreplacing Sneeky Pete, they had<br />\ntwo members of a west-coast<br />\nbluegrass band called Country<br />\nGazette, and ex-Byrd Gram<br />\nParsons, who quit the Burritos<br />\nover a year ago because of \"a<br />\ncycle accident and other<br />\nproblems,\" according to their<br />\nPR release. Those \"other<br />\nproblems\" became evident when<br />\nParsons began nodding out over<br />\nthe microphone. Though he had<br />\ntrouble playing the guitar and<br />\nsinging at the same time, his<br />\nvoice was beautiful, especially<br />\non \"Wild Horses,\" the Stones'<br />\nsong the Burritos recorded on<br />\ntheir second album. At the end<br />\nof the evening Chris Hillman, the<br />\nfounder and obvious leader of<br />\nthe group, called the concert a<br />\n\"Burrito Memorial.\" The<br />\nex-Byrd bass player said nothing<br />\nfurther, so we'll just have to read<br />\nabout it in Rolling Stone.<br />\nMeanwhile, the music was<br />\ngood. The Burritos did some of<br />\ntheir favorites, like Merle<br />\nHaggard's \"White Line Fever,\"<br />\nand \"Colorado,\" the latter sung<br />\nby Rick Roberts, Gram Parsons<br />\nerstwhile replacement, whose<br />\naddition to the group added a<br />\nfolksy lyrical side.

Towards the end<br />\nthey started having a good time<br />\nalong with the dancers, doing<br />\n\"Dream Baby,\" and an old Elvis<br /><br />\nsong, \"Honey,Honey.\" They<br />\nclosed with an instrumental, a<br />\nshort break from everyone, and<br />\nthen a quick exit. It was<br />\nsomething of a shame that the<br />\nBurritos didn't get called backi<br />\nfor an encore after what may<br />\nhave been their last concert.<br />\nMost of those that had been<br /><br />\nlistening gave them a standing<br />\nJvauon, but most of the others<br />\nhurried out.
