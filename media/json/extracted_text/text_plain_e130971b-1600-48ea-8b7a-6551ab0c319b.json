Ted Rohrlich<br />\nPeter Hughes, Harry Kcyserling<br />\n<br />\nWe Demand...<br />\nWe demand that the University Administration immediately revoke its injunction and take steps toward holding a<br />\nbinding student-faculty referendum on military recruitment<br />\non campus. This injunction flagrantly violates the rights of<br />\nstudents and faculty to free speech and assembly. The<br />\nonly way the Administration can redeem itself from the<br />\nimmediate crisis is to hold within the next forth-eight<br />\nhours a student-faculty one-man one-vote referendum. The<br />\nAdministration must consent to abide by the results of<br />\nthis referendum as reflected by the wishes of a majority<br />\nof those voting. We further demand that the Administration announce its intentions within twenty-four hours.<br />\nAt the Homewood House sit-in Friday, Dr. Gordon suggested a non-binding weighted vote. \"I'm sorry,\" he said,<br />\n\"but I don't think the University can be governed on the<br />\nbasis of one student vote equals one faculty vote.\" Deviating from standard electoral procedure, our President announced that it would be improper to accept the results of<br />\n,an election in which only 20 per cent of the community<br />\nvoted, even though 90 per cent voted one way. Lincoln<br />\nGordon believes in democracy \u2014 when it's convenient.<br />\nYesterday, Dr. Gordon released a \"new\" proposal even<br />\nthough he openly admits that he has not changed his views<br />\nof Friday. His plan calls for selection of a student-facultyadministration committee to canvass the opinions of the<br />\nHopkins community on military recruiting on campus.<br />\nWith the appointed members of this committee would lie<br />\nthe power to interpret the results of the canvass as they see<br />\nfit. The canvass would not begin until an open convocation<br />\nhad been called sometime in the future. If the protestors<br />\naccept this offer, Gordon said he will rescind the injunction. We reject this measure as a ploy designed to<br />\nbuy off the demonstrators and quell public sentiment.<br />\nAnd to show democracy at work even clearer, let's look<br />\nat the injunction. First, it was drawn up after last May's<br />\nHomewood House takeover. The attached subpoena was<br />\nprepared . by Baltimore Supreme Bench Judge Dulaney<br />\nFoster on January 12. Last Friday, the temporary restraining order was signed by Judge James Perrott.<br />\nThe most striking characteristic of the injunction is its<br />\nvagueness. In issuing it, the University Administration<br />\nabrogated its responsibility to protect the rights of all<br />\nstudents and faculty. It elected to preserve the property<br />\nrights of an educational corporation at the expense of the<br />\nhuman rights of members of this community. Instead of<br />\nlegal recourse to simple trespass procedures, the University<br />\nchose to impose a general restraining order on all campus<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe injunction bans any congregation on University property which threatens to \"interfere with normal functions\" of the University. \"Creating or broadcasting... any<br />\nloud or excessive noise\" is also prohibited. Further, students and faculty are enjoined from making \"Threat(s), of<br />\nforce or violence.\" We accuse the Administration of<br />\na blatant attempt to crush dissent through this document.<br />\nThe first half of this semester was spent haggling over<br />\nthe discipline code. Now we find that the Administration<br />\nhad no intention of making use of this code. Acting independently of students and faculty and ignoring established procedures within the community. the Administration<br />\nwent to court to get an injunction.<br />\nFinally we return to the issue that started it all - military<br />\nrecruiting on campus. Regardless of how you feel on this<br />\nissue, such decisions should be madepby you. The Administration's actions on Friday prove that these decisions are<br />\nnow being made for you. This situation will continue<br />\nunless you do something about it.<br />\nSee you at the Levering Hall rally today at noon,<br />\nAnd<br />\nSir, we'll fight you all the way.<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER WILL PUBLISH MONDAY, WED\u2014<br />\nNESDAY AND FRIDAY THIS WEEK.<br />\n<br />\nApril 20, 1970<br />\n<br />\nInjunction Forbids Disturbing<br />\nHopkins'Normal Functions<br />\nStudent protesters have attacked the court injunction issued Friday as vague and unconstututional, while the University's lawyer, Charles<br />\nQuandt, asserts that it is only aimed at disruptive activity.<br />\nThe court order, issued by Circuit Court Judge<br />\nJames Perrott, contains a subpoena, a temporary<br />\nrestraining order and show-cause order for a final<br />\ninjunction, and a bill of complaint.

The canvass would not begin until an open convocation<br />\nhad been called sometime in the future. If the protestors<br />\naccept this offer, Gordon said he will rescind the injunction. We reject this measure as a ploy designed to<br />\nbuy off the demonstrators and quell public sentiment.<br />\nAnd to show democracy at work even clearer, let's look<br />\nat the injunction. First, it was drawn up after last May's<br />\nHomewood House takeover. The attached subpoena was<br />\nprepared . by Baltimore Supreme Bench Judge Dulaney<br />\nFoster on January 12. Last Friday, the temporary restraining order was signed by Judge James Perrott.<br />\nThe most striking characteristic of the injunction is its<br />\nvagueness. In issuing it, the University Administration<br />\nabrogated its responsibility to protect the rights of all<br />\nstudents and faculty. It elected to preserve the property<br />\nrights of an educational corporation at the expense of the<br />\nhuman rights of members of this community. Instead of<br />\nlegal recourse to simple trespass procedures, the University<br />\nchose to impose a general restraining order on all campus<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe injunction bans any congregation on University property which threatens to \"interfere with normal functions\" of the University. \"Creating or broadcasting... any<br />\nloud or excessive noise\" is also prohibited. Further, students and faculty are enjoined from making \"Threat(s), of<br />\nforce or violence.\" We accuse the Administration of<br />\na blatant attempt to crush dissent through this document.<br />\nThe first half of this semester was spent haggling over<br />\nthe discipline code. Now we find that the Administration<br />\nhad no intention of making use of this code. Acting independently of students and faculty and ignoring established procedures within the community. the Administration<br />\nwent to court to get an injunction.<br />\nFinally we return to the issue that started it all - military<br />\nrecruiting on campus. Regardless of how you feel on this<br />\nissue, such decisions should be madepby you. The Administration's actions on Friday prove that these decisions are<br />\nnow being made for you. This situation will continue<br />\nunless you do something about it.<br />\nSee you at the Levering Hall rally today at noon,<br />\nAnd<br />\nSir, we'll fight you all the way.<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER WILL PUBLISH MONDAY, WED\u2014<br />\nNESDAY AND FRIDAY THIS WEEK.<br /><br />\nApril 20, 1970<br /><br />\nInjunction Forbids Disturbing<br />\nHopkins'Normal Functions<br />\nStudent protesters have attacked the court injunction issued Friday as vague and unconstututional, while the University's lawyer, Charles<br />\nQuandt, asserts that it is only aimed at disruptive activity.<br />\nThe court order, issued by Circuit Court Judge<br />\nJames Perrott, contains a subpoena, a temporary<br />\nrestraining order and show-cause order for a final<br />\ninjunction, and a bill of complaint. The injunction<br />\nwas accompanied by an as yet unused arrest order,<br />\nsigned by Judge Charles Harris. Those who violate<br />\nthe injunction are subject to a contempt-of-court<br />\ncitation, which could lead to a jail term and/or<br />\nfines.<br /><br />\nEducational Corporation<br />\nThe plaintiff is listed as \"The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, an educational corporation.\" The defendants include five specifically named protesters: Jim Keogh, Larry Goldberg, Michael Ornstein, Richard Pfeffer and David Pepper. Also<br />\nincluded are \"all persons whose identity is presently unknown to whom notice of these proceedings may come\" - - and whose conduct threatens to disrupt the \"lawful operations and good order\" of the University.<br />\nThe defendants are prevented from meeting or<br />\nspeaking in such a manner as would disrupt the<br />\nnormal functions of the University. They are also<br />\nenjoined from using force or violence,or threatening to use such action. Unless the defendants successfully challenge the injunction at a hearing by<br />\nApril 22, the University can seek to make it<br /><br />\npermanent. Although issued on Friday, the injunction was prepared a while ago.<br />\nOne legal source felt that the vagueness of the<br />\norder would have a chilling effect on free speech<br />\nand free assembly. He also noted that serving an<br />\narrest order with this type of injunction is rare.<br />\nUsually, he said, a contempt citation - - and a<br />\nbench warrant for arrest - - is signed after the<br />\ninjunction is violated.<br />\nThe defendants have hired William Murphy to<br />\nrepresent them, and he is handling their case at<br />\na substantial financial loss.<br />\nCharles Quandt,the University's lawyer, said he<br />\nwas puzzled by charges that the injunction was politically repressive. \"We only want to prevent<br />\nactions like the Friday incident and the Thursday<br />\nnight demonstration in front of Dr. Gordon's<br />\nhouse,\" he declared. \"People don't understand,\"<br />\nhe continued, \"how hard it is to be a university<br />\npresident. You need your sleep.\"<br /><br />\nCrude Ass Kick<br />\nQuandt was also disturbed by what he termed the<br />\ncrude language used against Dr. Gordon when the<br />\nPresident spoke Friday. \"I don't think that I'd have<br />\nused that kind of language when I was in college.<br />\nIf I did, I'd be kicked out on my ass.\" He added,<br />\n\"I don't know, but maybe some of these kids<br />\nshould be, too.\"<br />\nAlthough he would not say whether the University would definitely seek a permanent extension of<br />\nthe injunction, he said, \"We have a right to make<br />\nit permanent.\" And, he concluded,\"Life must go<br />\non, even though there are some disagreements.\"<br /><br />\nInjunction Excerpts<br />\nFROM THE TEMPORARY<br />\nRESTRAINING ORDER:<br />\nORDERED that the Defendants named or described above and all other persons receiving notice of this Order be and they are hereby forthwith restrained and enjoined:<br />\n(1)From congregating- or assemblingw ithin or adjacent to any of Plaintiff's academic<br />\nor administrative buildings, dormitories, recreation rooms or athletic facilities or in any<br />\ncorridors, stairways, doorways and entrances<br />\nthereto, in such manner as to disrupt or interfere with normal functions conducted by<br />\nPlaintiff in such place or to block, hinder,<br />\nimpede, or interfere with ingress to or egress<br />\nfrom any of such properties by Plaintiff's faculty, administrators, students, employees or<br />\nguests;<br /><br />\nGlades Quandt, the University's lawyer,<br />\nreads the injunction from the steps of.Homewood<br />\nHouse.

Vice President and<br />\nProvost<br />\nWilliam Bevan stated yesterday that he<br />\nnever saw<br />\nthe injunction beforehand, and<br />\nby Sunday had<br />\nonly skimmed its contents.<br />\nRobert Bilgrave, Director of Student<br />\nAffairs,<br />\nclaimed there was no break of trust<br />\nwhen the<br />\nfront door to Homewood House was<br />\nlocked by by<br />\nadministrators. \"The simple reason for<br />\nthat was<br />\nthat we didn't want a large group<br />\nin the building<br />\nand that it was necessary to secure<br />\nthe building.\"<br /><br />\nFROM THE BILL OF<br />\nCOMPLAINT:<br />\nFIFTH \u2022 The disorderly acts of the Defendants and the unknown persons acting with<br />\nthem, as mentioned above, have created an imminent peril that similar activity may spread<br />\nto dther areas of the Plaintiff's campus,ca<br />\nusing<br />\na wider disruption of plaintiff's orderly academic operations and causing a wider threat<br />\nto the safety of Plaintiff's property and<br />\nthe<br />\npersonal safety of its officers, faculty, agents,<br />\nand student body at large.<br /><br />\nSIXTH \u2022 The Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law and irreparable injury is threatened to the Plaintiff's property and to the persons of its officers, agents, faculty, and student body unless an immediate injunction<br />\nagainst the disorderly acts complained of can<br />\nbe had.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40416, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "34e73752-86b6-4a02-8cbc-fc74f405fbd6", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14020-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14020, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "ec92bfd4-7bc1-4fd8-a185-8736bb95fbd7", "url": "/node/14020"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "4568a0ed-5f21-4ad2-b1fa-86c2c715d2e5"}]}
