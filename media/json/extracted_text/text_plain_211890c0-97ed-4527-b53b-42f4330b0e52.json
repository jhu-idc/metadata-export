At one time, it was possible to<br />\nalmost take seriously those who tried to limit Levering<br />\nHall activities. There seemed to be nothing especially<br />\nirrational about trying to place programs and budget<br />\nunder Dean Benton, or reduce Wickwire's course load,<br />\nor cut the budget slightly. But Wickwire's opponents are<br />\nnow shown to have close to a pathological hatred of<br />\ntutoring, drug education, draft counseling, patient<br />\nadvocacy, and the myriad of other activities that have<br />\nmade Levering Hall so popular with students and so<br />\nrespected by the citizens of Baltimore.<br />\nIf and when Benton and Harvey and the other Hopkins<br />\nofficials stop denying that they have made strenuous<br />\nefforts to damage Levering Hall, they will probably<br />\ncontend that other parts of the University are more<br />\ndeserving of financial aid. On the contrary, Levering<br />\nHall is an important part of what Dr. Eisenhower likes<br />\nto call the vital core of the University. As such, it<br />\ndeserves the support of University officials. And it<br />\nmerits the backing cf faculty and students, with<br />\nfinancial contributions and the strong support of its<br />\nprograms.<br />\n<br />\nActivity Fee<br />\nVoting today on the SAC Tee increase referendum will<br />\ngo a long way in determining the future of social activity<br />\nprograms at Hopkins.

For<br />\nthe first time since we arrived here, we are<br />\nreceiving more than token concern from the<br />\nPresident, and some faculty and administration members. We must not allow<br />\nourselves to be lulled into a false sense of<br />\nsecurity. The students must now take the<br />\ninitiative in striving for the many academic<br />\nand social changes that would make undergraduate life here more enjoyable.<br />\nThe first step in implementing change will<br />\ncome through the formation of a stronger<br />\nstudent government. The Student Senate,<br />\none having greater communication with the<br />\nstudents than the present Student Council,<br />\nshould be established. The student government must be a strong spokesman willing to<br />\nchampion the cause of the Hopkins undergraduate.<br />\nThere are several aspects of the undergraduate's life that demand immediate<br />\nattention. Steps must be taken to give<br />\nHopkins a greater sense of community than<br />\npresently exists. A Student Union is needed<br />\nat any school, but expecially one like<br />\nHopkins. After freshman year, each class<br />\ndisintegrates into a group of students devoid<br />\nof any sense of communal ties, not only, with<br />\neach other, but with the student body as a<br />\nwhole. A Student Union would place on a<br />\nmore tangible level the sense of unity that<br />\nmost of us strive for. Due to the current<br />\nfinancial crisis, the type of Student Union we<br />\neventually hope for cannot yet be built. The<br />\nplans for an interim Student Union should be<br />\ncautiously studied. We must avoid setting up<br />\na Student Union which we deem as temporary, but which will still be the only one<br />\nwhen adequate funds for a permanent<br />\nstructure are available.<br />\nIn its further efforts to develop a Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, the student government must<br />\nalso lend its support in working to end the<br />\nBringing the students<br />\nhousing crisis.<br />\ntogether through better housing in the<br />\nHomewood vicinity should be the concern of<br />\nevery undergraduate, especially their<br />\nselected representatives.<br />\nEach year the Senior Class will have one of<br />\nits members placed on the Board of<br />\nTrustees. The method of selecting this<br />\nstudent is still undecided. Since the purpose<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br />\n<br />\nFranchi<br />\nThe past Student Council elections have<br />\nperhaps reflected the underlying discontent<br />\nwith the intricacies of Hopkins' politics and<br />\nin my opinion they are not unrelated to the<br />\nrecent changes in the administration. A<br />\nsituation has been reached where grievances<br />\nhave grown to such an intolerable extent that<br />\neven the most studious at Hopkins have<br />\nfound it necessary to play an active role in<br />\nthe campus community. Furthermore, it is<br />\nobvious that the majority of undergraduates<br />\nhave recognized the need for a revision of the<br />\npresent Student Council. The alternatives<br />\nthat have been suggested fall under one of<br />\ntwo categories: a complete abolition of the<br />\nStudent Council, which appears to be an<br />\nextension of the previous apathy at Hopkins;<br />\nor an expansion of representation, the option, which from the results of the past<br />\nelection, seems to have been taken.<br />\nStudents felt that an administration more<br />\nresponsive to their needs was required and<br />\nthey obtained it. Now they have sought an<br />\nefficacious student government with the<br />\ncapabilities to work with such an administration and thus far perhaps they have<br />\nobtained that. This new student government<br />\nmust of necessity be a larger, more<br />\nrepresentative type than that of the present<br />\nStudent Council, one composed not of a<br />\nclosed group of elitists but of a body<br />\nrepresentative of the entire academic community.<br />\nIt is my proposal to attempt to initiate a<br />\nmore academic adaptation of the plan<br />\nsubmitted by the recently elected, Gerry<br />\nBates. This organization would be composed<br />\nof a pre-determined number of representatives, all of whom would be elected according to their major and therefore<br />\nallowing for equal representation among all<br />\nundergraduates. It would avoid the one<br />\nmajor flaw of Bates' plan -- that of electing \u2022<br />\nthe representatives from fraternities and<br />\nSuch an<br />\nother campus organizations.<br />\nelection as he has suggested would produce a<br />\nbody as unrepresentative as the current<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nExactly what developments will result<br />\nfrom such an innovation we cannot be sure of<br />\nbut we can examine the implications of it.<br />\nFirst, and of greatest importance, the<br />\nfaculty and administration could no longer<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br />\n<br />\nAlfred Dimiero and John Franchi are candidates for the office ofSenior Class President.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE .*7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMay 4, 1971<br />\n<br />\nRibald reverie at the raunchy Rex revue<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThe real point of doing all<br />\nthe articles was the chance to<br />\nget to see dirty movies at the<br />\nRex.

Invariably, they snicker as you<br />\nfunble for money in your<br />\nwallet. And the lady at the<br />\nRex was a young woman who<br />\nstared at me with a silent<br />\nhaughty contempt.

So pause a moment in your busy<br />\nschedule\u2014cramming for finals, deciphering your notes, raising<br />\nbail\u2014to look over this list of charming gift suggestions.<br />\nWe will start with the hardest gift problem of all: what do<br />\nyou give the person who has everything? Well sir, here are some<br />\ngifts I promise you he does not have:<br />\n1. A low hurdle.<br />\n2. A street map of Perth, Australia.<br />\n3. Fifty pounds of goose fat.<br />\n4. A supply of Miller High Life Beer.<br />\n\"What?\" you exclaim, your young eyebrows leaping in perpendicular incredulity. \"The person who has everything does not<br />\nhave a supply of Miller High Life Beer?\" you rasp, your young<br />\nlips curling in horizontal derision. \"What arrant nonsense!\" you<br />\nsnarl, making a coarse gesture.<br />\nBut I reply with an emphatic \"No!\" The person who has<br />\neverything, I insist, does not have a supply of Miller High Life<br />\nBeer\u2014not for long anyhow\u2014because if he is a person who enjoys<br />\na beer light but mellow, hearty but delicate, a beer that cloys not,<br />\nneither does it pall, a beer that is forever amber and forever<br />\nambrosia, a beer deliciously dependable and dependably delicious,<br />\na beer, in short,for all seasons\u2014if, I say, he is a person who enjoys<br />\nsuch a beer\u2014and who does not? eh? who does not?\u2014then he does<br />\nnot have a supply. of Miller High Life. What he has is a supply<br />\nof empty Miller cans and bottles and a thirst that could turn<br />\ndangerous if neglected.<br />\nSo of course we will give all our graduating friends plenty<br />\nof Miller High Life.

At one time, it was possible to<br />\nalmost take seriously those who tried to limit Levering<br />\nHall activities. There seemed to be nothing especially<br />\nirrational about trying to place programs and budget<br />\nunder Dean Benton, or reduce Wickwire's course load,<br />\nor cut the budget slightly. But Wickwire's opponents are<br />\nnow shown to have close to a pathological hatred of<br />\ntutoring, drug education, draft counseling, patient<br />\nadvocacy, and the myriad of other activities that have<br />\nmade Levering Hall so popular with students and so<br />\nrespected by the citizens of Baltimore.<br />\nIf and when Benton and Harvey and the other Hopkins<br />\nofficials stop denying that they have made strenuous<br />\nefforts to damage Levering Hall, they will probably<br />\ncontend that other parts of the University are more<br />\ndeserving of financial aid. On the contrary, Levering<br />\nHall is an important part of what Dr. Eisenhower likes<br />\nto call the vital core of the University. As such, it<br />\ndeserves the support of University officials. And it<br />\nmerits the backing cf faculty and students, with<br />\nfinancial contributions and the strong support of its<br />\nprograms.<br /><br />\nActivity Fee<br />\nVoting today on the SAC Tee increase referendum will<br />\ngo a long way in determining the future of social activity<br />\nprograms at Hopkins.

A vote for the increase will result in<br />\nmaking money available to many student programs;<br />\nfailure to do so will only underwrite the Administration's severe reduction in funding.<br />\nStudents dissatisfied with the scope of this year's.<br />\nprograms will be encouraged to note that the proposed<br />\nincrease, small in terms of the individual, will generate<br />\nover $10,000 for expenditures next year.

For<br />\nthe first time since we arrived here, we are<br />\nreceiving more than token concern from the<br />\nPresident, and some faculty and administration members. We must not allow<br />\nourselves to be lulled into a false sense of<br />\nsecurity. The students must now take the<br />\ninitiative in striving for the many academic<br />\nand social changes that would make undergraduate life here more enjoyable.<br />\nThe first step in implementing change will<br />\ncome through the formation of a stronger<br />\nstudent government. The Student Senate,<br />\none having greater communication with the<br />\nstudents than the present Student Council,<br />\nshould be established. The student government must be a strong spokesman willing to<br />\nchampion the cause of the Hopkins undergraduate.<br />\nThere are several aspects of the undergraduate's life that demand immediate<br />\nattention. Steps must be taken to give<br />\nHopkins a greater sense of community than<br />\npresently exists. A Student Union is needed<br />\nat any school, but expecially one like<br />\nHopkins. After freshman year, each class<br />\ndisintegrates into a group of students devoid<br />\nof any sense of communal ties, not only, with<br />\neach other, but with the student body as a<br />\nwhole. A Student Union would place on a<br />\nmore tangible level the sense of unity that<br />\nmost of us strive for. Due to the current<br />\nfinancial crisis, the type of Student Union we<br />\neventually hope for cannot yet be built. The<br />\nplans for an interim Student Union should be<br />\ncautiously studied. We must avoid setting up<br />\na Student Union which we deem as temporary, but which will still be the only one<br />\nwhen adequate funds for a permanent<br />\nstructure are available.<br />\nIn its further efforts to develop a Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, the student government must<br />\nalso lend its support in working to end the<br />\nBringing the students<br />\nhousing crisis.<br />\ntogether through better housing in the<br />\nHomewood vicinity should be the concern of<br />\nevery undergraduate, especially their<br />\nselected representatives.<br />\nEach year the Senior Class will have one of<br />\nits members placed on the Board of<br />\nTrustees. The method of selecting this<br />\nstudent is still undecided. Since the purpose<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br /><br />\nFranchi<br />\nThe past Student Council elections have<br />\nperhaps reflected the underlying discontent<br />\nwith the intricacies of Hopkins' politics and<br />\nin my opinion they are not unrelated to the<br />\nrecent changes in the administration. A<br />\nsituation has been reached where grievances<br />\nhave grown to such an intolerable extent that<br />\neven the most studious at Hopkins have<br />\nfound it necessary to play an active role in<br />\nthe campus community. Furthermore, it is<br />\nobvious that the majority of undergraduates<br />\nhave recognized the need for a revision of the<br />\npresent Student Council. The alternatives<br />\nthat have been suggested fall under one of<br />\ntwo categories: a complete abolition of the<br />\nStudent Council, which appears to be an<br />\nextension of the previous apathy at Hopkins;<br />\nor an expansion of representation, the option, which from the results of the past<br />\nelection, seems to have been taken.<br />\nStudents felt that an administration more<br />\nresponsive to their needs was required and<br />\nthey obtained it. Now they have sought an<br />\nefficacious student government with the<br />\ncapabilities to work with such an administration and thus far perhaps they have<br />\nobtained that. This new student government<br />\nmust of necessity be a larger, more<br />\nrepresentative type than that of the present<br />\nStudent Council, one composed not of a<br />\nclosed group of elitists but of a body<br />\nrepresentative of the entire academic community.<br />\nIt is my proposal to attempt to initiate a<br />\nmore academic adaptation of the plan<br />\nsubmitted by the recently elected, Gerry<br />\nBates. This organization would be composed<br />\nof a pre-determined number of representatives, all of whom would be elected according to their major and therefore<br />\nallowing for equal representation among all<br />\nundergraduates. It would avoid the one<br />\nmajor flaw of Bates' plan -- that of electing \u2022<br />\nthe representatives from fraternities and<br />\nSuch an<br />\nother campus organizations.<br />\nelection as he has suggested would produce a<br />\nbody as unrepresentative as the current<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nExactly what developments will result<br />\nfrom such an innovation we cannot be sure of<br />\nbut we can examine the implications of it.<br />\nFirst, and of greatest importance, the<br />\nfaculty and administration could no longer<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br /><br />\nAlfred Dimiero and John Franchi are candidates for the office ofSenior Class President.<br /><br />\nPAGE .*7<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nMay 4, 1971<br /><br />\nRibald reverie at the raunchy Rex revue<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThe real point of doing all<br />\nthe articles was the chance to<br />\nget to see dirty movies at the<br />\nRex. Of course, I was going<br />\nthere only as a journalist. So<br />\nnow, I was going to see<br />\ngenuine sexploitation films,<br />\nUNUSUAL REQUESTS and<br />\nCINEMA VERITE. As I<br />\ndrove to the theater, I conelaborate<br />\nstructed<br />\nrationalizations to convince<br />\nmyself that my interest in the<br />\nfilms was aloof and campy,<br />\nas befits a suave young<br />\nreporter. Actually, I was<br />\ndying to see the flicks.<br />\nBut I kept up a journalistic<br />\nfacade. Approaching the box<br />\noffice, I tried for the<br />\narrogant, assured expression<br />\nthat would simply tell<br />\neveryone I was here for a<br />\nlaugh. I tried to imagine how<br />\nTom Wolfe would look going<br />\nto a dirty movie by himself.<br />\nGetting closer to the box<br />\noffice, though, I was seized<br />\nwith that old adolescent<br />\ndread of the cashier. Invariably, they snicker as you<br />\nfunble for money in your<br />\nwallet. And the lady at the<br />\nRex was a young woman who<br />\nstared at me with a silent<br />\nhaughty contempt. I felt like<br />\nshouting to her across the<br />\nglass partition, \"No, you<br />\ndon't understand! I'm here<br />\nonly as a reporter!

So pause a moment in your busy<br />\nschedule\u2014cramming for finals, deciphering your notes, raising<br />\nbail\u2014to look over this list of charming gift suggestions.<br />\nWe will start with the hardest gift problem of all: what do<br />\nyou give the person who has everything? Well sir, here are some<br />\ngifts I promise you he does not have:<br />\n1. A low hurdle.<br />\n2. A street map of Perth, Australia.<br />\n3. Fifty pounds of goose fat.<br />\n4. A supply of Miller High Life Beer.<br />\n\"What?\" you exclaim, your young eyebrows leaping in perpendicular incredulity. \"The person who has everything does not<br />\nhave a supply of Miller High Life Beer?\" you rasp, your young<br />\nlips curling in horizontal derision. \"What arrant nonsense!\" you<br />\nsnarl, making a coarse gesture.<br />\nBut I reply with an emphatic \"No!\" The person who has<br />\neverything, I insist, does not have a supply of Miller High Life<br />\nBeer\u2014not for long anyhow\u2014because if he is a person who enjoys<br />\na beer light but mellow, hearty but delicate, a beer that cloys not,<br />\nneither does it pall, a beer that is forever amber and forever<br />\nambrosia, a beer deliciously dependable and dependably delicious,<br />\na beer, in short,for all seasons\u2014if, I say, he is a person who enjoys<br />\nsuch a beer\u2014and who does not? eh? who does not?\u2014then he does<br />\nnot have a supply. of Miller High Life. What he has is a supply<br />\nof empty Miller cans and bottles and a thirst that could turn<br />\ndangerous if neglected.<br />\nSo of course we will give all our graduating friends plenty<br />\nof Miller High Life. And if you're looking for some additional<br />\ngifts, too, here are more suggestions:<br /><br />\nHave you thought of<br /><br />\nUMBC?<br />\nEight-week session:<br />\nJune 21 - August 13<br />\nFour-week session:<br />\nJune 21 - July 16<br />\nFour-week session: June July 19 - August 13<br />\nApplication deadline: June 15<br />\nRegistration: June 16 and 17<br />\nAmerican Studies<br />\nArt<br />\nBiology<br />\nChemistry<br />\nClassics<br />\nEconomics<br /><br />\nEducation<br />\nEnglish<br />\nFrench<br />\nGeography<br />\nHistory<br /><br />\nMathematics<br />\nMusic<br />\nPhilosophy<br />\nPhysics<br />\nPolitical Science<br /><br />\nPsychology<br />\nSociology<br />\nSocial Work<br />\nSpeech<br />\nTheatre<br />\nWorld Literature<br /><br />\nDay and Evening classes<br />\nCompletely air conditioned facilities<br /><br />\nFor someone graduating with a degree in American history,<br />\nhow about a hand-blown jade figurine of Millard Fillmore with a<br />\nclock in the stomach?

Around a bend is the<br />\npath, and pressed close to the<br />\nstream, the house hides in a<br />\ncover of wild growth. Only<br />\nthe protruding \"trays\" are<br />\nvisible.
