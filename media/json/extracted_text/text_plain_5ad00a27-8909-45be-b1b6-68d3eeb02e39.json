McC. T., '96.<br />\n<br />\nMODERN FICTION.<br />\nI have been asked to give a brief summary of<br />\nthe \"Modern Fiction\" lectures, and am glad<br />\nto do so. The object of the course was to<br />\ndraw attention to the Novel as an art-form<br />\ncomparatively new, and to indicate its rich development during the present century, especially in the past fifty years. The Novel, as we<br />\ncall it, has evolved out of a fictional history<br />\nthat is, no doubt, pre-historic, and its crystallization into its present form is a recent thing.<br />\nThat form is the most popular and influential<br />\nof the modern division of literature. Its study<br />\nis appropriate today, and it is sure to receive<br />\nmore and more the attention of scholars.<br />\nIn the Donovan course the rise of the Novel<br />\nwith Richardson and Fielding in England was<br />\ntraced and a picture given of the social environment at that time, which naturally demanded an organ of self-expression like this library<br />\nform. There was an increased desire for subjective personal activity ; man realized himself in society, and, as a result, the fiction of<br />\nanalysis, of analytic character study, appeared<br />\n\u2014a tendency marking modern life increasingly, so that the analytic impulse has persisted and grown ever since, giving us the latter-day Novel of analysis, wherein man in the<br />\ncontemporaneous social complex is depicted.<br />\nThe origin of the Novel\u2014standing for the<br />\nnew analysis as against the older romance\u2014<br />\nhaving been thus explained, the analytic development was then followed in its ramifications<br />\nin the countries which have cultivated it with<br />\nsuccess, illustrations being drawn from the<br />\nsignificant writers.

They will show their forensic<br />\nability in debating the old war cry of the<br />\nFrench Revolution that \"All men are born<br />\nfree and equal.\" Senators Stearns, Hodges<br />\nand R. D. Miller were elected as advisors to<br />\nthe debating team. The Censor announced<br />\nalso that Professor Adams has kindly given a<br />\ngold medal for the winners. Senator W. P.<br />\nStewart was heartily applauded for his plea for<br />\nFlawaiian annexation. Senator Brown refuted<br />\nskillfully some of Senator Clunet's arguments,<br />\nproving to him that I rawaiians were brown,<br />\nnot black, and that his conception of the Monroe doctrine was rather confused. Senator<br />\nGordon, who closed the affirmative, thought<br />\nthat his opponent's arguments were no good,<br />\nanyway,\" and this opinion decided their defeat.<br />\nThe House of Representatives met Wednesday, January 19. The session was taken up<br />\nwith the debate : \"Resolved, That the United<br />\nStates should annex Hawaii.\" The main purpose of this debate was to drill the members of<br />\nthe House in expressing their views forcibly<br />\nand clearly, as a preparatory training for the<br />\nEaster debate. It also afforded the Censor an<br />\nopportunity to become familiar with the voices<br />\nand mannerisms of the speakers. The question was manifestly well thought out by the<br />\ndebaters and presented in a convincing and<br />\nentertaining manner. The speakers on the<br />\naffirmative side were Congressmen Levering,<br />\nRoss, French, Fischer and Mullen ; on the<br />\nnegative side, Congressmen Davidson, Murkland, Morgan, Gemmil, Grimes and Guggenheimer. The affirmative side, though supported by fewer speakers, was better presented and<br />\nthe House indorsed this opinion by voting that<br />\nthe affirmative side had won the debate. The<br />\ndexterous arguments of Speaker French and<br />\nCongressman Ross were greatly responsible<br />\nfor this victory. Congressman Fischer, with<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nhis ready, adaptable wit, showed how well serious arguments could be presented in an entertaining manner. His amusing story of two<br />\nlittle children and a philosopher was quite to<br />\nthe point. Mr. Censor announced that the<br />\nspeakers selected for the joint debate at Easter<br />\nwill be required to take a special course in<br />\npublic speaking.<br />\nThe question for the next meeting is :<br />\n\"Resolved, That all. men are free and equal.\"<br />\nThe following men have been selected by<br />\nMr. Censor to arrange for the debate.

Though the foremost scholars of the<br />\nworld have contributed to this stupendous<br />\nwork, its inception and successful completion<br />\nare solely due to the genius and indomitable<br />\nperseverance of Professor Haupt. He conceived that the English-speaking people needed a modern English Bible, and he proceeded<br />\nto give it to them, in spite of the greatest difficulties and opposition from all sides.<br />\nAt a meeting of the Philological Association<br />\nlast Friday Professor Haupt gave an interesting and amusing account of the genesis of his<br />\n-Bible, dwelling more especially upon his own<br />\nconceptions of what is modern and idiomatic<br />\nEnglish, and the difficulty he experienced in<br />\nenforcing them in the new translations. The<br />\nauthorized version of King James seems to<br />\nhave become invested with a peculiar sanctity,<br />\nbeing cherished all the more as it grew archaic<br />\nand unintelligible.

The<br />\ncourse was very popular with the ladies, whose<br />\ninterest led to some rather undignified scrambling for seats. Perhaps this confirms the<br />\nstatement, so often made, that women are<br />\ngreater novel-readers than men.<br />\nDr. Burton's style is vigorous and energetic,<br />\nat times almost jerky. His English is precise.<br />\nHis consistent use of the subjunctive was especially noticeable.<br />\nIn his criticisms he represents the healthy<br />\nstate of mind that he mentioned as an attribute<br />\nof the people. His views in regard to the<br />\nfuture of literature are decidedly optimistic. It<br />\nwas easy to listen to his lectures, but hard to<br />\ntake satisfactory notes. Dr. Burton knows the<br />\nvalue of the half-humorous, lighter touch<br />\nwhich so relieves the weight and dignity of a<br />\nserious lecture. A clever phrase or a bit of<br />\nanecdote sends a ripple of laughter over the<br />\n<br />\naudience and renews its interest. This is a<br />\ntrait of Dr. Woodrow Wilson. It is this that<br />\nmakes the classroom lectures of certain in our<br />\nown faculty so attractive. Dr. Burton's popularity with the ladies culminated in a reception<br />\nin his honor at the Woman's College at the<br />\nclose of the course. In another column we<br />\nprint an article by Dr. Burton, entitled \"Modern Fiction.\" It has special reference to his<br />\nlectures here, and will be especially interesting<br />\nto all who heard them.<br />\nLong life to the Anti-Vivisection Society of<br />\nMaryland ! And may their tender hearts<br />\nnever become hard, nor their trustful minds<br />\nprone to doubt the passing rumor. How<br />\ncharming is their simple faith ! How spontaneous and intense their sympathy for every<br />\nform of woe! But we fear their overflowing<br />\nhearts have altogether swamped their other<br />\nfaculties. The charges of wanton cruelty they<br />\nbring against the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool are so utterly absurd that they boomerang themselves to death. Nevertheless,<br />\nDr. Franklin, of the Baltimore News, has<br />\ntaken the trouble, in an able editorial, to show<br />\nhow grossly the Medical School has been misrepresented. If we are to believe these good<br />\npeople, the \"doings\" over on Broadway excel<br />\nin fiendish ingenuity anything ever practiced<br />\nby frenzied savage or Spanish Inquisition.<br />\n\"They will take a dog, burn its nose, lay bare<br />\nits spinal column and apply powerful electric<br />\ncurrents, pour hot lead into its stomach, remove portions of its body and graft portions<br />\nof other animals on, tear out its entrails and<br />\ninsert others, divide the brain and dip half its<br />\nbody into a kettle of boiling water, and singe<br />\nthe hair from its back, after having removed<br />\nits windpipe to prevent its crying.\" We are<br />\nall naturally very anxious to meet that dog<br />\nand ask it how it feels after so varied an experience.<br />\nIt's dollars to doughnuts that our kind<br />\nfriends know as much about the methods employed in vivisection as did the dog, after the<br />\nabove-mentioned operation.

In a world where there is so much<br />\nneed of the positive efforts of all good people,<br />\nit seems a pity that so much misguided energy<br />\nshould be wasted on the scent of a phantom.<br />\nThe organization of a State association by<br />\nthe Virginia students is most certainly a step in<br />\nthe right direction, on which the men from the<br />\nOld Dominion are to be congratulated. Such<br />\nassociations add much to the social life of men<br />\nwho come to the Hopkins as strangers and<br />\nhave little time and opportunity to make acquaintances. There are a number of students<br />\nhere from other Southern States, particularly<br />\nNorth Carolina, and it is to be hoped that they<br />\nwill not be behind the Virginians. A general<br />\nSouthern association would also be a good<br />\nthing.<br />\n<br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nThe General Athletic Association Board<br />\nmet Friday,. January 14. Mr. R. H. Grimes<br />\nwas elected manager of the lacrosse team. Mr.<br />\nRobert Garrett was appointed captain of track<br />\nathletics. This is a new position. Heretofore<br />\nHopkins has had no track team, but simply a<br />\nrelay team. Messrs. Garrett and Scholl were<br />\nchosen to represent Hopkins in the Inter-collegiate Amateur Athletic Association of America, which meets in New York sonic time in<br />\nFebruary. Mr. George Knapp,Jr., was elected<br />\ndelegate to the Inter-collegiate Athletic Association of Maryland.<br />\nThe attitude that Yale has taken in regard to<br />\nthe proposed inter-collegiate boat race cannot<br />\nbut strike an unprejudiced observer as unreasonable. The Alumni Weekly rejoices because<br />\nYale is not to be tempted into the pursuit of<br />\ngeneral championships, and has not grown<br />\nsensitive to the comparative prowess of other<br />\ninstitutions.\" Such an attitude of high-andmightiness is anything but warranted by<br />\nYale's recent record in various branches of<br />\nathletics, and should she maintain her stand<br />\n<br />\nshe will be in need of all the\"lack of sensitiveness\" to outside opinion that she can muster.<br />\nManager Grimes has written to Swarthmore,<br />\nCollege of the City of New York, Crescent<br />\nAthletic Club of Brooklyn, Columbia and several other clubs for practice lacrosse games,<br />\nand expects to have a good schedule for this<br />\nspring. Should we get games from all those<br />\nwritten to, our team will have had good practice when the championship games in the<br />\nStevens and Lehigh come off.<br />\nRooters are very scarce at the hockey<br />\ngames. Last year rooters were out in full force,<br />\nbut now it is quite a surprise if as many as<br />\nthree turn up. Nevertheless, the team seems<br />\nto be doing good work. Hopkins holds second place in the Hockey League, and has a fair<br />\nchance of coming out first.<br />\nHopkins played off the tie with M. A.

Men of all<br />\nnations can compete, provided their work is<br />\nwritten in French, Latin or Roumanian.<br />\nMr. Joshua Levering, Jr., was elected manager of the Glee, Banjo and Mandolin Clubs,<br />\nand appointed as his assistant Mr. Conway S.<br />\nHodges. The Clubs had their pictures taken<br />\nSaturday last.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n(Continuedfrom page 3.)<br />\n<br />\nElizabethan English and Hebraisms was what<br />\nProfessor Haupt found most difficult to combat. In the most commonplace passages concerning Hebrew sacrifices, there was manifested a reluctance to substituting every-day<br />\nEnglish for words that have long since become<br />\npoetic or obsolete. Many amusing examples<br />\nof this sort were cited, while to show the absurdity of reproducing Hebrew constructions<br />\nin translation, the Professor put the first sentence of a newspaper report of the student<br />\nriots at Paris into the traditional biblical form,<br />\nconnecting all the clauses with that invariable<br />\nparticle 'and' with which we are so familiar.<br />\nProfessor Haupt hopes that his new version<br />\nwill lead to an increased and more intelligent<br />\nstudy of the Bible, especially amongst those<br />\nwho represent the wider circle of Christianity.<br />\nWhile his work must prove of immense service to the scholar and student, it seems hardly<br />\nlikely that the new version will soon win much<br />\nfavor from the great mass of Bible readers.<br />\nThe half-poetic, archaic form of the old version constitutes one of its chief charms, while<br />\nany unintelligibility only increases the gratification which the religious sense finds in the<br />\nmystic.<br />\nCuba was the subject under discussion in<br />\nthe Historical and Political Science Assoc<br />\niation on Friday evening. In the course of the<br />\nevening interesting addresses were delivered<br />\nby Dr. Latane, a recent graduate of the University, and Mr. Bump of the editorial staff of<br />\nThe Sun. Dr. Latane touched upon our early<br />\ndiplomatic relations in regard to Cuba, and<br />\nwas of the opinion that these early relations<br />\nfurnish parallels, if not prototypes, of all<br />\nthe<br />\nmodern complications of the question.<br />\nA<br />\nrapid resume of the historical facts was given<br />\n,<br />\nand especial attention was attracted to the<br />\nattempted intervention by the United State<br />\ns in<br />\n1873. The changed attitude of Spain<br />\nput an<br />\nend to such proceedings. This attem<br />\npt was<br />\nvigorously denied by the State Departme<br />\nnt at<br />\nthe time, and the facts were not made<br />\npublic<br />\nuntil a year or so ago, when all the past<br />\ncorrespondence in regard to Cuba was trans<br />\nmitted<br />\nby the President to the Senate. Even then<br />\nthis<br />\n<br />\nincident was overlooked until Dr. Latane recently unearthed it amid a mass of State<br />\npapers.<br />\nMr. Bump gave a very interesting account of<br />\nthe various filibustering expeditions, especially<br />\nthe famous Laurada and Woodall expeditions. The ingenuity and adroitness with<br />\nwhich these attempts were planned and executed, and also the fondness for Baltimore as a<br />\nstarting point, was commented upon. Mr.<br />\nBump considered Secretary Gage's contention<br />\nthat Spanish Consuls in America should take<br />\ninitiative in ferreting out these expeditions was<br />\nin variance with that principle of international<br />\nlaw practically established by the decision of<br />\nthe arbitration board in the famous Alabama<br />\ncase.<br />\nThe meeting of the Scientific Association on<br />\nJanuary 20 was the occasion of an interesting<br />\naddress by Dr. Clarke on his trip to Russia last<br />\nsummer. Dr. Clarke, with several other Hopkins men, attended, as delegate, the Inter<br />\nnational Congress of Geologists, held at St. Petersburg. After the sessions of the Congr<br />\ness<br />\nwere concluded, he went on the trip through<br />\nCaucasia given to the delegates by the Russian<br />\nGovernment. On his return to this city he<br />\nwrote an account of this trip for THE NEWS<br />\nLETTER.<br />\nIn his address Dr. Clarke, after giving some<br />\naccount of the Congress, the distinguis<br />\nhed<br />\nmen in attendance, and the elaborate<br />\npreparations of the Russian Government for<br />\ntheir reception and entertainment, described<br />\nhis trip<br />\nto Caucasia. The description was<br />\nillustrated<br />\nby a number of pictures of peasant life<br />\nand of<br />\nthe magnificent scenery of the<br />\nCaucasus<br />\nMountains, reproduced on the stere<br />\nopticon<br />\nfrom photographs taken by members<br />\nof the<br />\nparty.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees have under consi<br />\nderation a plan by which the whole physi<br />\nological<br />\ndepartment of the University will be<br />\nmoved<br />\nfrom its present quarters in the<br />\nbiological<br />\nbuilding, on the corner of Ross and<br />\nEutaw<br />\nstreets, to a new building to be erect<br />\ned at the<br />\nMedical School adjoining the Johns<br />\nHopkins<br />\nHospital.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nUNIVERSITY CHAT.<br />\nA most remarkable display of heroism, undaunted courage and desperate defiance was<br />\nlately shown to the college by the seemingly<br />\nmeek and humble freshmen. Putting their<br />\nheads together after the drawing class one afternoon, they resolved upon a desperate plan<br />\nwhich required courage and recklessness to<br />\nexecute. We all shudder to think how these<br />\ntender lambs blindly exposed themselves to<br />\ndanger. Instantly their plan decided upon,<br />\nthey hurried down the precipitous stairs that<br />\nlead to the drawing-room, and with superhuman strength and courage they held the hall<br />\ndoor, thereby barring the exit of Dr. Whiteman. Resolutely they held, not one bit<br />\ndaunted, as they heard the slow, firm tread of<br />\nDr. Whiteman descending the stairs. He has<br />\npassed the second story and is now descending<br />\nto the first floor.<br />\n\"They spake not a word;<br />\nBut, like dumb statues or breathing stones,<br />\nGazed each on other, and looked deathly pale.\"<br />\n\u2014Richard III.<br />\nThe Doctor tried the door, but it yielded<br />\nnot, and brooding suspicion awakened in his<br />\nmind a realization that some outward force was<br />\nresisting his efforts. Immediately his stern<br />\nvoice reached the ears of the freshmen without.<br />\nTheir courage wavered, fell, rose and then departed forever. Scattered and in confusion<br />\nthey ran, nor did they stop until they were<br />\nsafely harbored in the quiet repose of McCoy<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Library was the recipient of a gift of two hundred medical books<br />\nand a collection of fine drawings on skin diseases from Dr. Morrison,lately deceased. Dr.<br />\nMorrison was prominently connected with the<br />\nskin department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nThe Provost of the University of Pennsylvania in an address said, with reference to the<br />\nannouncement that there were many students<br />\nin the University of Chicago who were actually<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nstarving to death, that the class of students attending the Chicago University was not the<br />\nrich class that attend Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Pennsylvania.<br />\nA meeting of the class of '99 was held Tuesday, January I\u00b0. The all-important question,<br />\nwhich demands the most careful thought of<br />\nthe class, was thoroughly discussed. The class<br />\nelected Henry Bogue and Maurice Lazenby<br />\nmembers of the House Committee of the new<br />\ngymnasium.<br />\nNotwithstanding the fact that\" pot-socials\"<br />\nare conspicuous this year by their absence, the<br />\nfreshmen's policy of asserting themselves on<br />\nall occasions, even before the highly revered<br />\nseniors, is a very dangerous one,and will probably lead to an active revival of the tine-honored, subduing \"pots.\"<br />\nThe bank clerks of Baltimore assembled last<br />\nFriday evening in Levering Hall to form an<br />\norganization. The purposes of the organization are both social and beneficial, in accordance with the plans of similar bodies throughout the country. Mr. John Winthrop Vernon<br />\nof Boston addressed the meeting.<br />\nHr.

He was, however, undoubtedly,<br />\nmistaken in supposing that a fee for the use of<br />\nlockers would deter students from exercising<br />\nin the gymnasium\u2014simply because attendance<br />\nto gymnasium work is compulsory for all<br />\nundergraduates. This is an old rule, which<br />\ncould not be strictly enforced in former years<br />\nfor lack of space in the old building.<br />\nDuring the past years the single teams paid<br />\ntheir expenses by scanty contributions from a<br />\npart of the students. Under this system the<br />\nmanagers found themselves continually on the<br />\nverge of bankruptcy. To remedy this evil, the<br />\nnew Athletic Association was formed, which<br />\nhas under its supervision the expenses of all<br />\nthe teams wearing the black and blue. The<br />\nincome derived from a yearly rent on the lockers will place the Athletic Association, and<br />\nwith it the whole field of Hopkins athletics, on<br />\na secure financial basis. Never again will the<br />\nmanagers have to go begging through the<br />\nUniversity. The equipment of teams, the salaries of coaches and trainers, will be assured<br />\nfor the whole future. The eventual surplus of<br />\nprosperous years may secure, as the students'<br />\nproperty, the long hoped-for athletic field. The<br />\nfailure to procure this money would leave<br />\nHopkins athletics in their old stage of stagnation. The only reliable income would be the<br />\nmoney derived from the membership dues for<br />\nthe Athletic Association, a paltry sum, as compared with the necessary expenses.<br />\nFor years past we have clamored over our<br />\nlack of college spirit, of interest in college athletics. We have looked here and there for<br />\ncauses, and for remedies. The cause lies with<br />\nus, the remedy can come from us only. Surely,<br />\nthis is the time to prove our loyalty by consenting, one and all, to the lasting welfare of<br />\nour athletics. Let us pay.<br />\nFor some of the poorest students enthusiasm<br />\nand expense can never form a pair.

McC. T., '96.<br /><br />\nMODERN FICTION.<br />\nI have been asked to give a brief summary of<br />\nthe \"Modern Fiction\" lectures, and am glad<br />\nto do so. The object of the course was to<br />\ndraw attention to the Novel as an art-form<br />\ncomparatively new, and to indicate its rich development during the present century, especially in the past fifty years. The Novel, as we<br />\ncall it, has evolved out of a fictional history<br />\nthat is, no doubt, pre-historic, and its crystallization into its present form is a recent thing.<br />\nThat form is the most popular and influential<br />\nof the modern division of literature. Its study<br />\nis appropriate today, and it is sure to receive<br />\nmore and more the attention of scholars.<br />\nIn the Donovan course the rise of the Novel<br />\nwith Richardson and Fielding in England was<br />\ntraced and a picture given of the social environment at that time, which naturally demanded an organ of self-expression like this library<br />\nform. There was an increased desire for subjective personal activity ; man realized himself in society, and, as a result, the fiction of<br />\nanalysis, of analytic character study, appeared<br />\n\u2014a tendency marking modern life increasingly, so that the analytic impulse has persisted and grown ever since, giving us the latter-day Novel of analysis, wherein man in the<br />\ncontemporaneous social complex is depicted.<br />\nThe origin of the Novel\u2014standing for the<br />\nnew analysis as against the older romance\u2014<br />\nhaving been thus explained, the analytic development was then followed in its ramifications<br />\nin the countries which have cultivated it with<br />\nsuccess, illustrations being drawn from the<br />\nsignificant writers.

They will show their forensic<br />\nability in debating the old war cry of the<br />\nFrench Revolution that \"All men are born<br />\nfree and equal.\" Senators Stearns, Hodges<br />\nand R. D. Miller were elected as advisors to<br />\nthe debating team. The Censor announced<br />\nalso that Professor Adams has kindly given a<br />\ngold medal for the winners. Senator W. P.<br />\nStewart was heartily applauded for his plea for<br />\nFlawaiian annexation. Senator Brown refuted<br />\nskillfully some of Senator Clunet's arguments,<br />\nproving to him that I rawaiians were brown,<br />\nnot black, and that his conception of the Monroe doctrine was rather confused. Senator<br />\nGordon, who closed the affirmative, thought<br />\nthat his opponent's arguments were no good,<br />\nanyway,\" and this opinion decided their defeat.<br />\nThe House of Representatives met Wednesday, January 19. The session was taken up<br />\nwith the debate : \"Resolved, That the United<br />\nStates should annex Hawaii.\" The main purpose of this debate was to drill the members of<br />\nthe House in expressing their views forcibly<br />\nand clearly, as a preparatory training for the<br />\nEaster debate. It also afforded the Censor an<br />\nopportunity to become familiar with the voices<br />\nand mannerisms of the speakers. The question was manifestly well thought out by the<br />\ndebaters and presented in a convincing and<br />\nentertaining manner. The speakers on the<br />\naffirmative side were Congressmen Levering,<br />\nRoss, French, Fischer and Mullen ; on the<br />\nnegative side, Congressmen Davidson, Murkland, Morgan, Gemmil, Grimes and Guggenheimer. The affirmative side, though supported by fewer speakers, was better presented and<br />\nthe House indorsed this opinion by voting that<br />\nthe affirmative side had won the debate. The<br />\ndexterous arguments of Speaker French and<br />\nCongressman Ross were greatly responsible<br />\nfor this victory. Congressman Fischer, with<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nhis ready, adaptable wit, showed how well serious arguments could be presented in an entertaining manner. His amusing story of two<br />\nlittle children and a philosopher was quite to<br />\nthe point. Mr. Censor announced that the<br />\nspeakers selected for the joint debate at Easter<br />\nwill be required to take a special course in<br />\npublic speaking.<br />\nThe question for the next meeting is :<br />\n\"Resolved, That all. men are free and equal.\"<br />\nThe following men have been selected by<br />\nMr. Censor to arrange for the debate.

Though the foremost scholars of the<br />\nworld have contributed to this stupendous<br />\nwork, its inception and successful completion<br />\nare solely due to the genius and indomitable<br />\nperseverance of Professor Haupt. He conceived that the English-speaking people needed a modern English Bible, and he proceeded<br />\nto give it to them, in spite of the greatest difficulties and opposition from all sides.<br />\nAt a meeting of the Philological Association<br />\nlast Friday Professor Haupt gave an interesting and amusing account of the genesis of his<br />\n-Bible, dwelling more especially upon his own<br />\nconceptions of what is modern and idiomatic<br />\nEnglish, and the difficulty he experienced in<br />\nenforcing them in the new translations. The<br />\nauthorized version of King James seems to<br />\nhave become invested with a peculiar sanctity,<br />\nbeing cherished all the more as it grew archaic<br />\nand unintelligible.

The<br />\ncourse was very popular with the ladies, whose<br />\ninterest led to some rather undignified scrambling for seats. Perhaps this confirms the<br />\nstatement, so often made, that women are<br />\ngreater novel-readers than men.<br />\nDr. Burton's style is vigorous and energetic,<br />\nat times almost jerky. His English is precise.<br />\nHis consistent use of the subjunctive was especially noticeable.<br />\nIn his criticisms he represents the healthy<br />\nstate of mind that he mentioned as an attribute<br />\nof the people. His views in regard to the<br />\nfuture of literature are decidedly optimistic. It<br />\nwas easy to listen to his lectures, but hard to<br />\ntake satisfactory notes. Dr. Burton knows the<br />\nvalue of the half-humorous, lighter touch<br />\nwhich so relieves the weight and dignity of a<br />\nserious lecture. A clever phrase or a bit of<br />\nanecdote sends a ripple of laughter over the<br /><br />\naudience and renews its interest. This is a<br />\ntrait of Dr. Woodrow Wilson. It is this that<br />\nmakes the classroom lectures of certain in our<br />\nown faculty so attractive. Dr. Burton's popularity with the ladies culminated in a reception<br />\nin his honor at the Woman's College at the<br />\nclose of the course. In another column we<br />\nprint an article by Dr. Burton, entitled \"Modern Fiction.\" It has special reference to his<br />\nlectures here, and will be especially interesting<br />\nto all who heard them.<br />\nLong life to the Anti-Vivisection Society of<br />\nMaryland ! And may their tender hearts<br />\nnever become hard, nor their trustful minds<br />\nprone to doubt the passing rumor. How<br />\ncharming is their simple faith ! How spontaneous and intense their sympathy for every<br />\nform of woe! But we fear their overflowing<br />\nhearts have altogether swamped their other<br />\nfaculties. The charges of wanton cruelty they<br />\nbring against the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool are so utterly absurd that they boomerang themselves to death. Nevertheless,<br />\nDr. Franklin, of the Baltimore News, has<br />\ntaken the trouble, in an able editorial, to show<br />\nhow grossly the Medical School has been misrepresented. If we are to believe these good<br />\npeople, the \"doings\" over on Broadway excel<br />\nin fiendish ingenuity anything ever practiced<br />\nby frenzied savage or Spanish Inquisition.<br />\n\"They will take a dog, burn its nose, lay bare<br />\nits spinal column and apply powerful electric<br />\ncurrents, pour hot lead into its stomach, remove portions of its body and graft portions<br />\nof other animals on, tear out its entrails and<br />\ninsert others, divide the brain and dip half its<br />\nbody into a kettle of boiling water, and singe<br />\nthe hair from its back, after having removed<br />\nits windpipe to prevent its crying.\" We are<br />\nall naturally very anxious to meet that dog<br />\nand ask it how it feels after so varied an experience.<br />\nIt's dollars to doughnuts that our kind<br />\nfriends know as much about the methods employed in vivisection as did the dog, after the<br />\nabove-mentioned operation.

In a world where there is so much<br />\nneed of the positive efforts of all good people,<br />\nit seems a pity that so much misguided energy<br />\nshould be wasted on the scent of a phantom.<br />\nThe organization of a State association by<br />\nthe Virginia students is most certainly a step in<br />\nthe right direction, on which the men from the<br />\nOld Dominion are to be congratulated. Such<br />\nassociations add much to the social life of men<br />\nwho come to the Hopkins as strangers and<br />\nhave little time and opportunity to make acquaintances. There are a number of students<br />\nhere from other Southern States, particularly<br />\nNorth Carolina, and it is to be hoped that they<br />\nwill not be behind the Virginians. A general<br />\nSouthern association would also be a good<br />\nthing.<br /><br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nThe General Athletic Association Board<br />\nmet Friday,. January 14. Mr. R. H. Grimes<br />\nwas elected manager of the lacrosse team. Mr.<br />\nRobert Garrett was appointed captain of track<br />\nathletics. This is a new position. Heretofore<br />\nHopkins has had no track team, but simply a<br />\nrelay team. Messrs. Garrett and Scholl were<br />\nchosen to represent Hopkins in the Inter-collegiate Amateur Athletic Association of America, which meets in New York sonic time in<br />\nFebruary. Mr. George Knapp,Jr., was elected<br />\ndelegate to the Inter-collegiate Athletic Association of Maryland.<br />\nThe attitude that Yale has taken in regard to<br />\nthe proposed inter-collegiate boat race cannot<br />\nbut strike an unprejudiced observer as unreasonable. The Alumni Weekly rejoices because<br />\nYale is not to be tempted into the pursuit of<br />\ngeneral championships, and has not grown<br />\nsensitive to the comparative prowess of other<br />\ninstitutions.\" Such an attitude of high-andmightiness is anything but warranted by<br />\nYale's recent record in various branches of<br />\nathletics, and should she maintain her stand<br /><br />\nshe will be in need of all the\"lack of sensitiveness\" to outside opinion that she can muster.<br />\nManager Grimes has written to Swarthmore,<br />\nCollege of the City of New York, Crescent<br />\nAthletic Club of Brooklyn, Columbia and several other clubs for practice lacrosse games,<br />\nand expects to have a good schedule for this<br />\nspring. Should we get games from all those<br />\nwritten to, our team will have had good practice when the championship games in the<br />\nStevens and Lehigh come off.<br />\nRooters are very scarce at the hockey<br />\ngames.

The Clubs had their pictures taken<br />\nSaturday last.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n(Continuedfrom page 3.)<br /><br />\nElizabethan English and Hebraisms was what<br />\nProfessor Haupt found most difficult to combat. In the most commonplace passages concerning Hebrew sacrifices, there was manifested a reluctance to substituting every-day<br />\nEnglish for words that have long since become<br />\npoetic or obsolete. Many amusing examples<br />\nof this sort were cited, while to show the absurdity of reproducing Hebrew constructions<br />\nin translation, the Professor put the first sentence of a newspaper report of the student<br />\nriots at Paris into the traditional biblical form,<br />\nconnecting all the clauses with that invariable<br />\nparticle 'and' with which we are so familiar.<br />\nProfessor Haupt hopes that his new version<br />\nwill lead to an increased and more intelligent<br />\nstudy of the Bible, especially amongst those<br />\nwho represent the wider circle of Christianity.<br />\nWhile his work must prove of immense service to the scholar and student, it seems hardly<br />\nlikely that the new version will soon win much<br />\nfavor from the great mass of Bible readers.<br />\nThe half-poetic, archaic form of the old version constitutes one of its chief charms, while<br />\nany unintelligibility only increases the gratification which the religious sense finds in the<br />\nmystic.<br />\nCuba was the subject under discussion in<br />\nthe Historical and Political Science Assoc<br />\niation on Friday evening. In the course of the<br />\nevening interesting addresses were delivered<br />\nby Dr. Latane, a recent graduate of the University, and Mr. Bump of the editorial staff of<br />\nThe Sun. Dr. Latane touched upon our early<br />\ndiplomatic relations in regard to Cuba, and<br />\nwas of the opinion that these early relations<br />\nfurnish parallels, if not prototypes, of all<br />\nthe<br />\nmodern complications of the question.<br />\nA<br />\nrapid resume of the historical facts was given<br />\n,<br />\nand especial attention was attracted to the<br />\nattempted intervention by the United State<br />\ns in<br />\n1873. The changed attitude of Spain<br />\nput an<br />\nend to such proceedings. This attem<br />\npt was<br />\nvigorously denied by the State Departme<br />\nnt at<br />\nthe time, and the facts were not made<br />\npublic<br />\nuntil a year or so ago, when all the past<br />\ncorrespondence in regard to Cuba was trans<br />\nmitted<br />\nby the President to the Senate. Even then<br />\nthis<br /><br />\nincident was overlooked until Dr. Latane recently unearthed it amid a mass of State<br />\npapers.<br />\nMr. Bump gave a very interesting account of<br />\nthe various filibustering expeditions, especially<br />\nthe famous Laurada and Woodall expeditions. The ingenuity and adroitness with<br />\nwhich these attempts were planned and executed, and also the fondness for Baltimore as a<br />\nstarting point, was commented upon. Mr.<br />\nBump considered Secretary Gage's contention<br />\nthat Spanish Consuls in America should take<br />\ninitiative in ferreting out these expeditions was<br />\nin variance with that principle of international<br />\nlaw practically established by the decision of<br />\nthe arbitration board in the famous Alabama<br />\ncase.<br />\nThe meeting of the Scientific Association on<br />\nJanuary 20 was the occasion of an interesting<br />\naddress by Dr. Clarke on his trip to Russia last<br />\nsummer. Dr. Clarke, with several other Hopkins men, attended, as delegate, the Inter<br />\nnational Congress of Geologists, held at St. Petersburg. After the sessions of the Congr<br />\ness<br />\nwere concluded, he went on the trip through<br />\nCaucasia given to the delegates by the Russian<br />\nGovernment. On his return to this city he<br />\nwrote an account of this trip for THE NEWS<br />\nLETTER.<br />\nIn his address Dr. Clarke, after giving some<br />\naccount of the Congress, the distinguis<br />\nhed<br />\nmen in attendance, and the elaborate<br />\npreparations of the Russian Government for<br />\ntheir reception and entertainment, described<br />\nhis trip<br />\nto Caucasia. The description was<br />\nillustrated<br />\nby a number of pictures of peasant life<br />\nand of<br />\nthe magnificent scenery of the<br />\nCaucasus<br />\nMountains, reproduced on the stere<br />\nopticon<br />\nfrom photographs taken by members<br />\nof the<br />\nparty.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees have under consi<br />\nderation a plan by which the whole physi<br />\nological<br />\ndepartment of the University will be<br />\nmoved<br />\nfrom its present quarters in the<br />\nbiological<br />\nbuilding, on the corner of Ross and<br />\nEutaw<br />\nstreets, to a new building to be erect<br />\ned at the<br />\nMedical School adjoining the Johns<br />\nHopkins<br />\nHospital.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nUNIVERSITY CHAT.<br />\nA most remarkable display of heroism, undaunted courage and desperate defiance was<br />\nlately shown to the college by the seemingly<br />\nmeek and humble freshmen.

The all-important question,<br />\nwhich demands the most careful thought of<br />\nthe class, was thoroughly discussed. The class<br />\nelected Henry Bogue and Maurice Lazenby<br />\nmembers of the House Committee of the new<br />\ngymnasium.<br />\nNotwithstanding the fact that\" pot-socials\"<br />\nare conspicuous this year by their absence, the<br />\nfreshmen's policy of asserting themselves on<br />\nall occasions, even before the highly revered<br />\nseniors, is a very dangerous one,and will probably lead to an active revival of the tine-honored, subduing \"pots.\"<br />\nThe bank clerks of Baltimore assembled last<br />\nFriday evening in Levering Hall to form an<br />\norganization. The purposes of the organization are both social and beneficial, in accordance with the plans of similar bodies throughout the country.

He was, however, undoubtedly,<br />\nmistaken in supposing that a fee for the use of<br />\nlockers would deter students from exercising<br />\nin the gymnasium\u2014simply because attendance<br />\nto gymnasium work is compulsory for all<br />\nundergraduates. This is an old rule, which<br />\ncould not be strictly enforced in former years<br />\nfor lack of space in the old building.<br />\nDuring the past years the single teams paid<br />\ntheir expenses by scanty contributions from a<br />\npart of the students. Under this system the<br />\nmanagers found themselves continually on the<br />\nverge of bankruptcy. To remedy this evil, the<br />\nnew Athletic Association was formed, which<br />\nhas under its supervision the expenses of all<br />\nthe teams wearing the black and blue. The<br />\nincome derived from a yearly rent on the lockers will place the Athletic Association, and<br />\nwith it the whole field of Hopkins athletics, on<br />\na secure financial basis. Never again will the<br />\nmanagers have to go begging through the<br />\nUniversity. The equipment of teams, the salaries of coaches and trainers, will be assured<br />\nfor the whole future. The eventual surplus of<br />\nprosperous years may secure, as the students'<br />\nproperty, the long hoped-for athletic field. The<br />\nfailure to procure this money would leave<br />\nHopkins athletics in their old stage of stagnation. The only reliable income would be the<br />\nmoney derived from the membership dues for<br />\nthe Athletic Association, a paltry sum, as compared with the necessary expenses.<br />\nFor years past we have clamored over our<br />\nlack of college spirit, of interest in college athletics. We have looked here and there for<br />\ncauses, and for remedies. The cause lies with<br />\nus, the remedy can come from us only. Surely,<br />\nthis is the time to prove our loyalty by consenting, one and all, to the lasting welfare of<br />\nour athletics. Let us pay.<br />\nFor some of the poorest students enthusiasm<br />\nand expense can never form a pair. We have<br /><br />\nlittle doubt that the Treasurer could find<br />\nmeans of lightening their burden.<br />\nY. M. C. A.<br />\nThe Y. M. C. A.
