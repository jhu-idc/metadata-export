Mitchell, the black<br />\nDemocratic Congressional candidate who narrowly beat<br />\nSam Friedel for the Seventh District nomination, is<br />\nfacing a down-to-the-wire contset with Republican Peter<br />\nParker. The campaign has been marked by smear<br />\ntactics from the Parker side reminiscent of the McCarthy era. Playing on the fears of whites in the district,<br />\nParker has dubbed Mitchell a \"black racist\" and accused him of receiving financial support from the Black<br />\nPanthers.<br />\nPeter Parker is a hard-line backer of Nixon-Agnew.<br />\nHis slogan, \"People Power,\" belies his position on the<br />\nissues, which have been irresponsible, if not ignorant.<br />\nCalling himself a peace candidate, the most intelligent<br />\nthing he has had to say is that he is more for peace than<br />\nMitchell since he has a family and Mitchell is a<br />\nbachelor.<br />\nMitchell, on the other hand, is probably one of the<br />\nmost over-qualified candidates in the nation. An advocate of immediate withdrawal from Vietnam in prefashionable 1966, he has also fought in the forefront of<br />\nthe civil rights battle from the beginning. He is a<br />\nprofessor of political science at Morgan State College<br />\nand a former head of the Baltimore Community Action<br />\nAgency. He is a man who knows the needs of the city and<br />\nwants to preserve the rights of its inhabitants.<br />\nLast year, he interposed himself between students and<br />\npolice at Morgan State after the Jackson State slayings<br />\nand played a role in moratorium demonstrations at<br />\nHopkins and the city. He has taken to the street for<br />\nstudent causes. It is time for students to take to the<br />\nstreets for his. Student volunteers put him over the top<br />\nin the primary and they can do it again Nov. 3.<br />\nTo do so is no sellout.<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduate Dean<br />\nDean Benton has hinted that the post of undergraduate dean may be retired along with Carl<br />\nSwanson. Swanson, who has held the position for four<br />\nyears and has been trying to resign for one, will call it<br />\nquits at the end of this semester. He has done a good job<br />\nand has more than earned the respect of students here<br />\nand the chance to return to his long-neglected research.<br />\nBut the question of his successor is the one that concerns<br />\nus now.<br />\nThe thought of abolishing his post, probably combining it with that of the graduate dean, would be merely<br />\nanother reduction of the status accorded undergraduates here.<br />\nFour years ago, there was only one associate dean-Robert Strider, now the graduate dean. He says that the<br />\npresent system works best, pointing out wisely that with<br />\n2,000 undergraduates, one man has his hands full<br />\ndealing with undergraduate affairs.<br />\nDean Benton says he wants to \"start with a new<br />\norganization at the end of intersession.\" That's fine, but<br />\nhe should keep in mind that his own desires for tight<br />\nadministrative control should take a back seat to the<br />\nneeds of students on this campus, and that students are<br />\ncapable of taking care of much of their own needs<br />\nthemselves. Not only should the post of undergraduate<br />\ndean be maintained, but students should have the major<br />\nsay in his selection. If they don't, his job will be immeasurably more difficult.<br />\n<br />\nPeter Parker People<br />\nThere are many reasons which motivate a man<br />\nto run for congress--none are more important to<br />\nme than the need to add voices of moderation to<br />\na nation on the verge of polarization.<br />\nBy JOIN LaMOTHE<br />\nThe above quote is from a speech by Peter<br />\nParker, delivered at Chizuk Amuno<br />\nCongregation, October 25, 1970. It sums up<br />\nwhy Pete Parker would give up a lucrative<br />\nlaw practice, resign an appointed position by Gov. Mandel (People's -Counsel<br />\nfor the State of Maryland), to seek the office<br />\nof Congress for a district where he, as a<br />\nRepublican, faces a 4 to 1 Democratic<br />\nregistration margin. Peter Parker, and men<br />\nlike him, are seeking elective office to<br />\nCongress throughout this country and are<br />\nbringing with their candidacies a rare<br />\ncombination of YOUTH AND EXPERIENCE:and a desire to serve the people<br />\nof their districts..<br />\nPEOPLE POWER is not just an idle<br />\nphrase dreamed up for the Election. It is the<br />\ncornerstone of the Parker Campaign. It<br />\nmeans serving in Congress as a representative of all of the people of the Seventh<br />\nDistrict...listening to their views and<br />\nreflecting these views on the floor of<br />\nCongress. As People's Counsel for the<br />\nState of Maryland, Mr. Parker has for the<br />\npast two and one-half years served the<br />\npeople of Maryland with distinction. In this<br />\ncapacity he has pleaded the case of the individual citizen and led the fight against rate<br />\nincreases by the large utility companies, bus<br />\nfare increases for school children, and<br />\nbecome one of the state's most authoritative and strongest spokesman in the field<br />\nof Ecology.<br />\nDuring the campaign, Peter Parker has<br />\nbeen consistent and forthright on his stands<br />\non the major issues of our day,even when his<br />\nposition places him in opposition to the<br />\npresent Republican administration. He has<br />\ndebated the issues with his opponent<br />\nthroughout the District, published position<br />\npapers on the Mid-East , Crime, and<br />\nEducation, and a four-page question and<br />\nanswer brochure on Vietnam, drugs, draft,<br />\ninflation, gun control,. etc. Because Parker<br />\nhas not altered his position since entering<br />\nthe race for Congress, the voters of the<br />\nDistrict are finding in this man an honest<br />\nvoice of concern, and a strong advocate<br />\nproblems.<br />\nunderstands their<br />\nwho<br />\n<br />\nThe easiest way for a man to run for<br />\nCongress in such a diverse district as the<br />\nSeventh Congressional District would be to<br />\ntell the voters what they want to hear,<br />\ndepending on what area of the District he<br />\nwas speaking in at the time. This has not<br />\nbeen so in Peter Parker's campaign.<br />\nSo many times, the news media, writers<br />\nand commentators have catagorized areas<br />\nof the Seventh Congressional District as<br />\nthe Jewish Block of votes, the Black Block<br />\nThe _Conservative Arbutusof Votes.<br />\nCatonsville vote, etc., etc. Peter Parker<br />\nbelieves that to classify an individual voter<br />\nin a particular block of votes is an insult to<br />\nthe individual's intelligence and injects into<br />\nthe election a cynicism which is without<br />\nvalidity.<br />\nPeter Parker feels \u2022that the Seventh<br />\nDistrict voters are concerned individuals<br />\ninterested in hearing what the candidates<br />\nhave to say on the vital .issues of our day.<br />\nFor this reason, he is adressing himself<br />\nto these issues and spends 16 hours a day<br />\nmeeting voters in every section of the<br />\nDistrict and reiterating his stands. Because<br />\nof this voter concern, the Parker-Mitchell<br />\nelection will be decided not on the basis of<br />\nparty labels, but by the voters deciding<br />\nwhich of the two candidates is best qualified<br />\nto reflect their views in Washington.<br />\nThe Parker campaign has had a<br />\ntremendous boost from the legion of student<br />\nvolunteers who are working for his election.<br />\nThese students, representing colleges, high<br />\nschools, and junior high schools from in<br />\nand around the 7th District, have worked<br />\nendlessly towards the election of Peter<br />\nParker. They have met the man, they have<br />\nheard him and they believe him. Throughout the campaign, Peter Parker has praised<br />\nthe efforts of his student volunteers. These<br />\nstudents have served as the backbone for the<br />\ncanvass operation in the District.<br />\nThe enthusiasm they've shown, and their<br />\nwillingness to work on any campaign chore<br />\ncombined with their knowledge of the issues<br />\nhas made a great impression on the 7th<br />\nDistrict voters. The question is always<br />\nraised as to why some campaigns have a<br />\ngreat many student volunteers while others<br />\ngo searching. I think the answer lies in the<br />\ncandidate himself and his ability to communicate his beliefs and ideas to students.<br />\n(continued to page 7)<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nBe Responsible<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe article in the Forum by<br />\nBill Van Diepen lends further<br />\ntestimony to the well known<br />\nfact that many apparently<br />\nrelatively intelligent people<br />\nprofit nothing from atcollege for four<br />\ntending<br />\nyears. I think he missed the<br />\npoint a bit, when he stated<br />\nthat he felt as though he had<br />\nbeen through an academic<br />\nvacuum, after three years as<br />\nan undergraduate at Hopkins.<br />\nHis article reflects that it is<br />\nmore likely that he has<br />\ncarried a vacuum between<br />\nhis ears through three years<br />\nas an undergraduate. There<br />\nare many graduates of<br />\nHopkins and other universities that accomplish as little<br />\nas he has accomplished by<br />\ngoing to a university, but<br />\nHopkins needs no testimonial.<br />\nThere are untold numbers<br />\nof graduates who have gone<br />\non to become responsible<br />\ncitizens, who have con-<br />\n<br />\ntributed to the welfare of<br />\nthemselves, their family,<br />\ntheir community, and the<br />\nworld.<br />\nIf he has accomplished no<br />\nmore than that which is<br />\nreflected in his article in<br />\nthree years, I suggest he not<br />\nwaste a fourth year at<br />\nHopkins, and make room for.<br />\nsomeone who might profit by<br />\nthe environment.<br />\nF.

It was in no<br />\nway related to illegal play or<br />\nimcompetent officiating.<br />\nI hope also that the<br />\nstatement referring to<br />\n\"serious infractions of the<br />\nrules promulgated by .the<br />\nHaverford squad\" is not<br />\ntaken to mean that their<br />\nplayers play \"dirty\" or are<br />\ncoached to do so. . .<br />\nThe injury is most unfortunate. The Haverford<br />\nplayers and the officials are<br />\njust as distressed as we are<br />\nthat it happened. They should<br />\nnot be blamed for it.<br />\nMarshall S.

Few students at Hopkins would make the connection between the 55(/ cold cut sub they bought at the B &<br />\nM and _Johnny Unitas or anyone else on the Colts or<br />\nOrioles ball teams eating lunch during a game break.<br />\nPerhaps the B & M is too much a part of the Hopkins<br />\n\"experience\" to be seen with an open eye. Since Mr.<br />\nBattaglia died two months ago of a heart attack, his sons.<br />\nJoe and Sonny, have been running the store -- business as<br />\nusual.<br />\n<br />\nBut they are making changes. Their steak subs now<br />\ncontain Australian rather than domestic beef, and within a<br />\nfew weeks they will begin to make pizza subs.

The game had<br />\nchanged over the years, and<br />\nall they had was Jerry<br />\nQuarry. Nice colored boys<br />\nlike Joe Louis and Floyd<br />\nPatterson had gone too, and<br />\nin their place was Cassius<br />\nClay, taunting, boasting,<br />\nbreaking the rules.

Come and get<br />\nBut godme, America!<br />\ndammit, the boy was good,<br />\nand they hated him for it.<br />\nSo when Ali won't step<br />\nforward at induction, they<br />\nmove in for the kill. The title<br />\ngoes and the money and even<br />\nthe exhibition bouts.

No, we<br />\ncould not love him like we<br />\nloved Patterson, because he<br />\nwas not sensitive and articulate.<br />\nOn the talk shows he<br />\nseemed like a Muslim puppet,<br />\nendlessly buttressing his<br />\narguments with fables and<br />\nHis face was<br />\nexamples.<br />\nbroad and dumb, and sitting<br />\nin the chair next to Zsa Zsa<br />\nGabor, he did not look like a<br />\nmartyr.<br />\nSo he came back by himself.

I felt<br />\nbitter for him now, and I<br />\nwanted him very much to<br />\nwin. Some combination of<br />\nliberal guilt and white admiration made me dig his<br />\nstyle and courage.<br />\nAlone at the Civic Center, I<br />\nknew too that I just wanted to<br />\nsee a fight, the blood, the<br />\nanger, the excitement. I had<br />\nnot know much of the sweet<br />\nthrill of fighting, but I knew<br />\nwhat it was like to beat<br />\nsomeone up. The quick flush<br />\nof hatred, the punches, yeah,<br />\nit was good. And so Ali could<br />\nlet us share some of that when<br />\nhe took on Quarry.<br />\nWhen the lights darkened,<br />\nthe crowd was expectant,<br />\nready to explode. Quarry was<br />\nshown first, working his way<br />\ntowards the ring. A few<br />\ncheers drifted out of the<br />\nseats, the faraway sound of<br />\nmuffled Baltimore County<br />\nwhites, but the boos were<br />\nlouder, some menace beneath<br />\nthe laughter.<br />\nThen, it was Ali, dressed in<br />\na white robe, and the cheers<br />\npoured from somewhere very<br />\ndeep inside the people and<br />\nthey stood with a joy you<br />\nto<br />\nbegin<br />\nnot<br />\ncould<br />\nimagine...MUHAMMAD!<br />\nALIEEEE! ALIEEEE!<br />\nALIEEEE!<br />\n...Shit, man! The crowd<br />\nwas hooting and stomping,<br />\nfists were raised, they were<br />\nready now. The Champ had<br />\nreturned, and they wanted<br />\n<br />\nLevering Hall<br />\n<br />\nblood.<br />\nWhen the fighters were<br />\nbrought together for the instructions, Ali drove the<br />\ncrowd wild as he tried to<br />\nscare Quarry.Standing inches<br />\naway, Ali cocked his head and<br />\nsneered, baring the white<br />\nguard that covered his teeth.<br />\nWith all the cool of his<br />\nhe<br />\nstreets,<br />\nLouisville<br />\nnarrowed his eyes and shook<br />\nhis head, as if to say, I'm a<br />\ntough motherfucker, white<br />\nboy, and you ain't gonna be<br />\nworth dog-shit when I'm<br />\nthrough with you. Dig?<br />\nQuarry tried to stare him<br />\ndown, but you could tell that<br />\nperhaps he was scared.<br />\nDuring the fight, Ali was<br />\nmuch quicker, his left jab<br />\nkept flicking in between<br />\nQuarry's gloves, damaging<br />\nthe face. Quarry could never<br />\nget Ali with his left hook,<br />\nbecause Ali would just roll<br />\naway, deflecting it with his<br />\nglove. But Muhammad was<br />\nsloppy as he fought, missing<br />\npunches with his right,<br />\nblowing chances.<br />\nOnly once did it come close<br />\nto a knockout. It was the<br />\nsecond round, I think, and All<br />\nhad Quarry in a corner near<br />\nthe ropes, jabbing sharply,<br />\nmoving in as Quarry tried to<br />\nbob away.<br />\npunches started<br />\nThe<br />\ncoming faster and we lunged<br />\nforward, blood pounding, and<br />\nI found myself shouting<br />\nmadly, \" Kill the motherfucker!\" This looked like it,<br />\nand I felt as if' Ali, could hear<br />\nus, that he would land that big<br />\n<br />\nMuhammad Ali in training session with Drew (Bundini) Brown.<br />\npunch for all of us screaming<br />\nfor Quarry's head.<br />\nBut he never did, and<br />\nsomething went out of the<br />\nfight then, and so we should<br />\nnot have been so disappointed<br />\nwhen a cut over Quarry's eye<br />\nended the fight.<br />\nOn the screen, it did not<br />\nlook too serious. You could<br />\nnot tell what was going on at<br />\nthe end of the third round.<br />\nPeople were swarming into<br />\nthe ring and the referee was<br />\nwaving his arms and then you<br />\nsaw Quarry burst out of his<br />\nSomething was<br />\ncorner.<br />\nwrong; the fight was over.<br />\nWe stood for a while, not<br />\nbelieving that the fight had<br />\n<br />\nChaplain's Office<br />\n<br />\nbeen ended for a...cut? '<br />\nThat's like a hangnail, I<br />\nthought. All those outraged<br />\nladies, protest songs and<br />\nboxing deaths had played<br />\ntheir part in stopping the<br />\nfight.<br />\nWe were angry, and then<br />\nsheepish, about spending<br />\n$7.50 to see a TKO at the end<br />\nof the third round.<br />\nYes, Ali had won, but even<br />\nthe blacks were not cheered<br />\nby the victory.

(The first most serious<br />\nproblem of course is the recent outbreak of moult among sorority<br />\nhouse canaries.)<br />\nLet us today look for answers to the parietal rights problem, for<br />\nthat is the purpose of these columns: to analyze the dilemmas that vex<br />\nour colleges, to seek feasible solutions. I write them for the brewers of<br />\nMiller High Life Peer. In return they pay me money. That is the<br />\nAmerican way. It has made this country great.<br />\nBut I digress. A parietal right, as you know of course, is the right<br />\nof a student to keep a parietal in his room. A parietal, as you know of<br />\ncourse, is a small North American marsupial somewhat like a chipmunk in appearance but actually a species of fur-bearing herring<br />\n(mu tails in utandis).<br />\n<br />\nAll other pictures<br />\nreturned in 24 hours.<br />\n<br />\ncolor processing by<br />\nKodak<br />\n<br />\n\"FOLK FACTORY\"<br />\nA variety of Folk sounds:<br />\nfeaturing outstanding young folk talent<br />\nfrom the Baltimore Area.<br />\n<br />\nCan Parietal Rights Bring Happiness?<br />\n<br />\nSERVICE PHOTO<br />\nSUPPLY CONPANY<br />\n<br />\n3011 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nBE 5-6200<br />\n<br />\nWe're<br />\n<br />\nCLOSER<br />\nSAFER<br />\nand<br />\nBETTER<br />\n<br />\nNaturally you all want to keep a parietal in your room. Not only<br />\nare they endlessly cheerful\u2014always romping and frisking and wagging<br />\ntheir little binaries\u2014but they're smart too. They're not as smart as<br />\ndogs of course, but they can readily learn simple tricks like fetching<br />\nyour slippers or parsing a sentence.<br />\nBut the main reason you want a parietal is because they eat nothing but beer cans. I promise you, friends, you get yourself a healthy<br />\nadult parietal and you'll never again have to lug empties to the trash<br />\nbarrel. And of course the better the beer can, the more he'll eat, which<br />\nof course accounts for the popularity of Miller lligh Life on every<br />\ncampus. Obviously a beer as good as Miller is bound to come in a can<br />\nof the same superb quality. And that's what Miller has\u2014superb quality. Also malt and hops and water and a marvelous brewing formula<br />\nthat's been kept secret for generations. In fact, this formula is so secret<br />\nthat it's known only to the chief brewmaster and he is never allowed<br />\nto leave the brewery. So if you ever find yourself in Milwaukee, look<br />\nup his wife.<br />\nBut I digress. A healthy adult parietal, I was saying, will eat his<br />\nweight in Miller beer cans every day. However, if you drink your<br />\nMiller in bottles\u2014 as millions do, and no wonder,for who is not tempted<br />\nby such sparkling amber goodness in such crystal-clear bottles? Eh?<br />\nWho is not?\u2014 if, I say, you drink your Miller in bottles, I have to tell<br />\nyou that parietals won't help. They don't eat bottles. In fact, the only<br />\npet that does is the scaly bursar (paramus neuuersus), but take my<br />\nadvice: don't get one. The scaly bursar at best is a beast of sluggish<br />\ndemeanor and uncertain temperament. Oh,sure, sometimes it will play<br />\na little Monopoly when it's in the mood, but mostly it just lays around<br />\ngrooming its addenda. Moreover, it's given to sudden fits of pique and<br />\nmay tusk you without warning.<br />\nBut I digress. Why, you ask, won't the dean let you keep a parietal in your room? I'll tell you why: the parietal, a nocturnal animal,<br />\nsleeps only by day. At night it is always awake and\u2014here's the rub\u2014<br />\nduring its waking hours it utters a loud, guttural croak approximately<br />\nonce every 2 1 seconds, a sound something like: \"Prock ...

Last year alone more than 30,000 of them were<br />\nkilled tripping on their nightshirts.<br />\nAnd so, dear friends, you see that the dean does have a point.<br />\nWon't you put down your grenade and have a meaningful dialogue<br />\nwith him? Sweet reason can still save your college. Don't let it go the<br />\nway of so many others\u2014abandoned hulks today, stark and silent except for ghostly sounds echoing in the night: \"Prock . ..

Mitchell, the black<br />\nDemocratic Congressional candidate who narrowly beat<br />\nSam Friedel for the Seventh District nomination, is<br />\nfacing a down-to-the-wire contset with Republican Peter<br />\nParker. The campaign has been marked by smear<br />\ntactics from the Parker side reminiscent of the McCarthy era. Playing on the fears of whites in the district,<br />\nParker has dubbed Mitchell a \"black racist\" and accused him of receiving financial support from the Black<br />\nPanthers.<br />\nPeter Parker is a hard-line backer of Nixon-Agnew.<br />\nHis slogan, \"People Power,\" belies his position on the<br />\nissues, which have been irresponsible, if not ignorant.<br />\nCalling himself a peace candidate, the most intelligent<br />\nthing he has had to say is that he is more for peace than<br />\nMitchell since he has a family and Mitchell is a<br />\nbachelor.<br />\nMitchell, on the other hand, is probably one of the<br />\nmost over-qualified candidates in the nation. An advocate of immediate withdrawal from Vietnam in prefashionable 1966, he has also fought in the forefront of<br />\nthe civil rights battle from the beginning. He is a<br />\nprofessor of political science at Morgan State College<br />\nand a former head of the Baltimore Community Action<br />\nAgency. He is a man who knows the needs of the city and<br />\nwants to preserve the rights of its inhabitants.<br />\nLast year, he interposed himself between students and<br />\npolice at Morgan State after the Jackson State slayings<br />\nand played a role in moratorium demonstrations at<br />\nHopkins and the city. He has taken to the street for<br />\nstudent causes. It is time for students to take to the<br />\nstreets for his. Student volunteers put him over the top<br />\nin the primary and they can do it again Nov. 3.<br />\nTo do so is no sellout.<br /><br />\nUndergraduate Dean<br />\nDean Benton has hinted that the post of undergraduate dean may be retired along with Carl<br />\nSwanson. Swanson, who has held the position for four<br />\nyears and has been trying to resign for one, will call it<br />\nquits at the end of this semester. He has done a good job<br />\nand has more than earned the respect of students here<br />\nand the chance to return to his long-neglected research.<br />\nBut the question of his successor is the one that concerns<br />\nus now.<br />\nThe thought of abolishing his post, probably combining it with that of the graduate dean, would be merely<br />\nanother reduction of the status accorded undergraduates here.<br />\nFour years ago, there was only one associate dean-Robert Strider, now the graduate dean. He says that the<br />\npresent system works best, pointing out wisely that with<br />\n2,000 undergraduates, one man has his hands full<br />\ndealing with undergraduate affairs.<br />\nDean Benton says he wants to \"start with a new<br />\norganization at the end of intersession.\" That's fine, but<br />\nhe should keep in mind that his own desires for tight<br />\nadministrative control should take a back seat to the<br />\nneeds of students on this campus, and that students are<br />\ncapable of taking care of much of their own needs<br />\nthemselves. Not only should the post of undergraduate<br />\ndean be maintained, but students should have the major<br />\nsay in his selection. If they don't, his job will be immeasurably more difficult.<br /><br />\nPeter Parker People<br />\nThere are many reasons which motivate a man<br />\nto run for congress--none are more important to<br />\nme than the need to add voices of moderation to<br />\na nation on the verge of polarization.<br />\nBy JOIN LaMOTHE<br />\nThe above quote is from a speech by Peter<br />\nParker, delivered at Chizuk Amuno<br />\nCongregation, October 25, 1970. It sums up<br />\nwhy Pete Parker would give up a lucrative<br />\nlaw practice, resign an appointed position by Gov. Mandel (People's -Counsel<br />\nfor the State of Maryland), to seek the office<br />\nof Congress for a district where he, as a<br />\nRepublican, faces a 4 to 1 Democratic<br />\nregistration margin. Peter Parker, and men<br />\nlike him, are seeking elective office to<br />\nCongress throughout this country and are<br />\nbringing with their candidacies a rare<br />\ncombination of YOUTH AND EXPERIENCE:and a desire to serve the people<br />\nof their districts..<br />\nPEOPLE POWER is not just an idle<br />\nphrase dreamed up for the Election. It is the<br />\ncornerstone of the Parker Campaign. It<br />\nmeans serving in Congress as a representative of all of the people of the Seventh<br />\nDistrict...listening to their views and<br />\nreflecting these views on the floor of<br />\nCongress. As People's Counsel for the<br />\nState of Maryland, Mr. Parker has for the<br />\npast two and one-half years served the<br />\npeople of Maryland with distinction. In this<br />\ncapacity he has pleaded the case of the individual citizen and led the fight against rate<br />\nincreases by the large utility companies, bus<br />\nfare increases for school children, and<br />\nbecome one of the state's most authoritative and strongest spokesman in the field<br />\nof Ecology.<br />\nDuring the campaign, Peter Parker has<br />\nbeen consistent and forthright on his stands<br />\non the major issues of our day,even when his<br />\nposition places him in opposition to the<br />\npresent Republican administration. He has<br />\ndebated the issues with his opponent<br />\nthroughout the District, published position<br />\npapers on the Mid-East , Crime, and<br />\nEducation, and a four-page question and<br />\nanswer brochure on Vietnam, drugs, draft,<br />\ninflation, gun control,. etc. Because Parker<br />\nhas not altered his position since entering<br />\nthe race for Congress, the voters of the<br />\nDistrict are finding in this man an honest<br />\nvoice of concern, and a strong advocate<br />\nproblems.<br />\nunderstands their<br />\nwho<br /><br />\nThe easiest way for a man to run for<br />\nCongress in such a diverse district as the<br />\nSeventh Congressional District would be to<br />\ntell the voters what they want to hear,<br />\ndepending on what area of the District he<br />\nwas speaking in at the time. This has not<br />\nbeen so in Peter Parker's campaign.<br />\nSo many times, the news media, writers<br />\nand commentators have catagorized areas<br />\nof the Seventh Congressional District as<br />\nthe Jewish Block of votes, the Black Block<br />\nThe _Conservative Arbutusof Votes.<br />\nCatonsville vote, etc., etc. Peter Parker<br />\nbelieves that to classify an individual voter<br />\nin a particular block of votes is an insult to<br />\nthe individual's intelligence and injects into<br />\nthe election a cynicism which is without<br />\nvalidity.<br />\nPeter Parker feels \u2022that the Seventh<br />\nDistrict voters are concerned individuals<br />\ninterested in hearing what the candidates<br />\nhave to say on the vital .issues of our day.<br />\nFor this reason, he is adressing himself<br />\nto these issues and spends 16 hours a day<br />\nmeeting voters in every section of the<br />\nDistrict and reiterating his stands. Because<br />\nof this voter concern, the Parker-Mitchell<br />\nelection will be decided not on the basis of<br />\nparty labels, but by the voters deciding<br />\nwhich of the two candidates is best qualified<br />\nto reflect their views in Washington.<br />\nThe Parker campaign has had a<br />\ntremendous boost from the legion of student<br />\nvolunteers who are working for his election.<br />\nThese students, representing colleges, high<br />\nschools, and junior high schools from in<br />\nand around the 7th District, have worked<br />\nendlessly towards the election of Peter<br />\nParker. They have met the man, they have<br />\nheard him and they believe him. Throughout the campaign, Peter Parker has praised<br />\nthe efforts of his student volunteers. These<br />\nstudents have served as the backbone for the<br />\ncanvass operation in the District.<br />\nThe enthusiasm they've shown, and their<br />\nwillingness to work on any campaign chore<br />\ncombined with their knowledge of the issues<br />\nhas made a great impression on the 7th<br />\nDistrict voters. The question is always<br />\nraised as to why some campaigns have a<br />\ngreat many student volunteers while others<br />\ngo searching. I think the answer lies in the<br />\ncandidate himself and his ability to communicate his beliefs and ideas to students.<br />\n(continued to page 7)<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nBe Responsible<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe article in the Forum by<br />\nBill Van Diepen lends further<br />\ntestimony to the well known<br />\nfact that many apparently<br />\nrelatively intelligent people<br />\nprofit nothing from atcollege for four<br />\ntending<br />\nyears. I think he missed the<br />\npoint a bit, when he stated<br />\nthat he felt as though he had<br />\nbeen through an academic<br />\nvacuum, after three years as<br />\nan undergraduate at Hopkins.<br />\nHis article reflects that it is<br />\nmore likely that he has<br />\ncarried a vacuum between<br />\nhis ears through three years<br />\nas an undergraduate. There<br />\nare many graduates of<br />\nHopkins and other universities that accomplish as little<br />\nas he has accomplished by<br />\ngoing to a university, but<br />\nHopkins needs no testimonial.<br />\nThere are untold numbers<br />\nof graduates who have gone<br />\non to become responsible<br />\ncitizens, who have con-<br /><br />\ntributed to the welfare of<br />\nthemselves, their family,<br />\ntheir community, and the<br />\nworld.<br />\nIf he has accomplished no<br />\nmore than that which is<br />\nreflected in his article in<br />\nthree years, I suggest he not<br />\nwaste a fourth year at<br />\nHopkins, and make room for.<br />\nsomeone who might profit by<br />\nthe environment.<br />\nF.

I felt<br />\nbitter for him now, and I<br />\nwanted him very much to<br />\nwin. Some combination of<br />\nliberal guilt and white admiration made me dig his<br />\nstyle and courage.<br />\nAlone at the Civic Center, I<br />\nknew too that I just wanted to<br />\nsee a fight, the blood, the<br />\nanger, the excitement. I had<br />\nnot know much of the sweet<br />\nthrill of fighting, but I knew<br />\nwhat it was like to beat<br />\nsomeone up. The quick flush<br />\nof hatred, the punches, yeah,<br />\nit was good. And so Ali could<br />\nlet us share some of that when<br />\nhe took on Quarry.<br />\nWhen the lights darkened,<br />\nthe crowd was expectant,<br />\nready to explode. Quarry was<br />\nshown first, working his way<br />\ntowards the ring. A few<br />\ncheers drifted out of the<br />\nseats, the faraway sound of<br />\nmuffled Baltimore County<br />\nwhites, but the boos were<br />\nlouder, some menace beneath<br />\nthe laughter.<br />\nThen, it was Ali, dressed in<br />\na white robe, and the cheers<br />\npoured from somewhere very<br />\ndeep inside the people and<br />\nthey stood with a joy you<br />\nto<br />\nbegin<br />\nnot<br />\ncould<br />\nimagine...MUHAMMAD!<br />\nALIEEEE! ALIEEEE!<br />\nALIEEEE!<br />\n...Shit, man! The crowd<br />\nwas hooting and stomping,<br />\nfists were raised, they were<br />\nready now. The Champ had<br />\nreturned, and they wanted<br /><br />\nLevering Hall<br /><br />\nblood.<br />\nWhen the fighters were<br />\nbrought together for the instructions, Ali drove the<br />\ncrowd wild as he tried to<br />\nscare Quarry.Standing inches<br />\naway, Ali cocked his head and<br />\nsneered, baring the white<br />\nguard that covered his teeth.<br />\nWith all the cool of his<br />\nhe<br />\nstreets,<br />\nLouisville<br />\nnarrowed his eyes and shook<br />\nhis head, as if to say, I'm a<br />\ntough motherfucker, white<br />\nboy, and you ain't gonna be<br />\nworth dog-shit when I'm<br />\nthrough with you. Dig?<br />\nQuarry tried to stare him<br />\ndown, but you could tell that<br />\nperhaps he was scared.<br />\nDuring the fight, Ali was<br />\nmuch quicker, his left jab<br />\nkept flicking in between<br />\nQuarry's gloves, damaging<br />\nthe face. Quarry could never<br />\nget Ali with his left hook,<br />\nbecause Ali would just roll<br />\naway, deflecting it with his<br />\nglove. But Muhammad was<br />\nsloppy as he fought, missing<br />\npunches with his right,<br />\nblowing chances.<br />\nOnly once did it come close<br />\nto a knockout. It was the<br />\nsecond round, I think, and All<br />\nhad Quarry in a corner near<br />\nthe ropes, jabbing sharply,<br />\nmoving in as Quarry tried to<br />\nbob away.<br />\npunches started<br />\nThe<br />\ncoming faster and we lunged<br />\nforward, blood pounding, and<br />\nI found myself shouting<br />\nmadly, \" Kill the motherfucker!\" This looked like it,<br />\nand I felt as if' Ali, could hear<br />\nus, that he would land that big<br /><br />\nMuhammad Ali in training session with Drew (Bundini) Brown.<br />\npunch for all of us screaming<br />\nfor Quarry's head.<br />\nBut he never did, and<br />\nsomething went out of the<br />\nfight then, and so we should<br />\nnot have been so disappointed<br />\nwhen a cut over Quarry's eye<br />\nended the fight.<br />\nOn the screen, it did not<br />\nlook too serious. You could<br />\nnot tell what was going on at<br />\nthe end of the third round.<br />\nPeople were swarming into<br />\nthe ring and the referee was<br />\nwaving his arms and then you<br />\nsaw Quarry burst out of his<br />\nSomething was<br />\ncorner.<br />\nwrong; the fight was over.<br />\nWe stood for a while, not<br />\nbelieving that the fight had<br /><br />\nChaplain's Office<br /><br />\nbeen ended for a...cut? '<br />\nThat's like a hangnail, I<br />\nthought. All those outraged<br />\nladies, protest songs and<br />\nboxing deaths had played<br />\ntheir part in stopping the<br />\nfight.<br />\nWe were angry, and then<br />\nsheepish, about spending<br />\n$7.50 to see a TKO at the end<br />\nof the third round.<br />\nYes, Ali had won, but even<br />\nthe blacks were not cheered<br />\nby the victory. They knew<br />\nthat their man still had to be<br />\ntested.<br />\nWe would all have to wait<br />\nfor the fight with Frazier for<br />\nMuhammad Ali to pay back<br />\nthe hard years of waiting.<br /><br />\nThe Only Peking Style Chinese<br />\nFood in Baltimore<br /><br />\nThe Sunday Experience<br />\nSunday, November 1, 1970<br />\n11 a.m. The Great Hall<br /><br />\n/44140)44W<br />\nROOtt<br /><br />\nJAMES W.

November 1st .<br />\nAdmission: 75c<br /><br />\nThe second most serious problem currently facing our troubled<br />\ncampuses is the problem of parietal rights. (The first most serious<br />\nproblem of course is the recent outbreak of moult among sorority<br />\nhouse canaries.)<br />\nLet us today look for answers to the parietal rights problem, for<br />\nthat is the purpose of these columns: to analyze the dilemmas that vex<br />\nour colleges, to seek feasible solutions. I write them for the brewers of<br />\nMiller High Life Peer. In return they pay me money. That is the<br />\nAmerican way. It has made this country great.<br />\nBut I digress. A parietal right, as you know of course, is the right<br />\nof a student to keep a parietal in his room. A parietal, as you know of<br />\ncourse, is a small North American marsupial somewhat like a chipmunk in appearance but actually a species of fur-bearing herring<br />\n(mu tails in utandis).<br /><br />\nAll other pictures<br />\nreturned in 24 hours.<br /><br />\ncolor processing by<br />\nKodak<br /><br />\n\"FOLK FACTORY\"<br />\nA variety of Folk sounds:<br />\nfeaturing outstanding young folk talent<br />\nfrom the Baltimore Area.<br /><br />\nCan Parietal Rights Bring Happiness?<br /><br />\nSERVICE PHOTO<br />\nSUPPLY CONPANY<br /><br />\n3011 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nBE 5-6200<br /><br />\nWe're<br /><br />\nCLOSER<br />\nSAFER<br />\nand<br />\nBETTER<br /><br />\nNaturally you all want to keep a parietal in your room. Not only<br />\nare they endlessly cheerful\u2014always romping and frisking and wagging<br />\ntheir little binaries\u2014but they're smart too. They're not as smart as<br />\ndogs of course, but they can readily learn simple tricks like fetching<br />\nyour slippers or parsing a sentence.<br />\nBut the main reason you want a parietal is because they eat nothing but beer cans. I promise you, friends, you get yourself a healthy<br />\nadult parietal and you'll never again have to lug empties to the trash<br />\nbarrel. And of course the better the beer can, the more he'll eat, which<br />\nof course accounts for the popularity of Miller lligh Life on every<br />\ncampus. Obviously a beer as good as Miller is bound to come in a can<br />\nof the same superb quality. And that's what Miller has\u2014superb quality. Also malt and hops and water and a marvelous brewing formula<br />\nthat's been kept secret for generations. In fact, this formula is so secret<br />\nthat it's known only to the chief brewmaster and he is never allowed<br />\nto leave the brewery. So if you ever find yourself in Milwaukee, look<br />\nup his wife.<br />\nBut I digress. A healthy adult parietal, I was saying, will eat his<br />\nweight in Miller beer cans every day. However, if you drink your<br />\nMiller in bottles\u2014 as millions do, and no wonder,for who is not tempted<br />\nby such sparkling amber goodness in such crystal-clear bottles? Eh?<br />\nWho is not?\u2014 if, I say, you drink your Miller in bottles, I have to tell<br />\nyou that parietals won't help. They don't eat bottles. In fact, the only<br />\npet that does is the scaly bursar (paramus neuuersus), but take my<br />\nadvice: don't get one. The scaly bursar at best is a beast of sluggish<br />\ndemeanor and uncertain temperament. Oh,sure, sometimes it will play<br />\na little Monopoly when it's in the mood, but mostly it just lays around<br />\ngrooming its addenda. Moreover, it's given to sudden fits of pique and<br />\nmay tusk you without warning.<br />\nBut I digress. Why, you ask, won't the dean let you keep a parietal in your room? I'll tell you why: the parietal, a nocturnal animal,<br />\nsleeps only by day. At night it is always awake and\u2014here's the rub\u2014<br />\nduring its waking hours it utters a loud, guttural croak approximately<br />\nonce every 2 1 seconds, a sound something like: \"Prock ...

Sweet reason can still save your college. Don't let it go the<br />\nway of so many others\u2014abandoned hulks today, stark and silent except for ghostly sounds echoing in the night: \"Prock . ..
