But what really irks is the fact that the<br />\nstudents are allowing the faculty to take the play right<br />\nout of their hands.<br />\nOne hundred and nine undergraduate contributors! One-seventh of the entire group! Surely more<br />\nthan this comparative handful are/interested in seeing<br />\na cage erected by next year for their use. If we<br />\nhadn't seen the list of contributors with our own eyes,<br />\nwe would have been inclined to suspect that Ed Sadtler was repaying us by such a mocking jest for some<br />\nof the friendly digs which we have let go in his<br />\ndirection this spring.
