The justification lies<br />\nin the lone facts that the College for<br />\nTeachers is not officially regarded as a<br />\npart of the undergraduate department in<br />\nthe University, and that members of that<br />\nschool do not pay the student activities<br />\nfee which aids in supporting campus activitie.<br />\nThe S.

But we do<br />\nwish the Jays the best of luck in the<br />\nannual classic.<br />\nThis year's Hopkins-Maryland game<br />\nmarks the thirtieth meeting on the gridiron of the two universities. In each<br />\nmeet there has existed sportsmanship and<br />\nfriendship, which, again this year, will<br />\nbe carried into every phase of the annual<br />\ngame on Thursday. No matter who wins,<br />\nthe game will carry the thrills and color<br />\nthat accompanies the Terrapin-Jay clash<br />\non Turkey Day.<br />\nIn speaking of athletic relations between the two institutions, Curly Byrd,<br />\nMaryland coach, in a letter said: \"Certainly as long as I have anything to do<br />\nwith the administration of affairs in the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, the cordial cooperation and pleasant friendship that now<br />\nexist between the two universities will<br />\nbe fostered to the limit of my ability.\"<br />\nThere is no possible denial of the fact<br />\nthat there is an agreeable, friendly spirit<br />\nexisting between the Hopkins and Maryland. That spirit will manifest itself in<br />\nthe game on Thursday.<br />\nWe sincerely hope, however, that the<br />\nstudents' spirit will not reach such a degree of overexuberance that property will<br />\nbe marred and destroyed in the pre-game<br />\ndemonstrations by members of both<br />\nschools. We call to the attention of the<br />\nHopkins men the fact that last year some<br />\ndeplorable things occurred in connection<br />\nwith these demonstrations. We implore<br />\nthat they hold their enthusiasm within<br />\ngentlemanly bounds. Games are not won<br />\nby marking up and destroying property<br />\nduring pre-game parades.<br />\n<br />\nPass The Motion<br />\nTHE motion before the Student Activities Council is of vital importance and<br />\nmust be adopted by that body. It is sound<br />\nand logical.<br />\nIt calls for these three vital things: (1)<br />\nthat students in only the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, School of Engineering, and<br />\nSchool of Business Economics shall be<br />\neligible for offices and membership in<br />\nactivities represented in the Student Activities Council; (2) that a New Plan<br />\nstudent can be eligible for participation<br />\nin-these activities until the conclusion of<br />\nwhat would be his fourth year of undergraduate residence; (3) that any member<br />\nof the three undergraduate schools who is<br />\nexpelled from the University by action of<br />\nStudent Council or University officials<br />\nshall automatically lose any post held in<br />\nany activity.<br />\nThis ruling, if passed, will exclude all<br />\nmembers of the College for Teachers from<br />\nmembership in any activity represented<br />\non the Student Activities Council.

But we do<br />\nwish the Jays the best of luck in the<br />\nannual classic.<br />\nThis year's Hopkins-Maryland game<br />\nmarks the thirtieth meeting on the gridiron of the two universities. In each<br />\nmeet there has existed sportsmanship and<br />\nfriendship, which, again this year, will<br />\nbe carried into every phase of the annual<br />\ngame on Thursday. No matter who wins,<br />\nthe game will carry the thrills and color<br />\nthat accompanies the Terrapin-Jay clash<br />\non Turkey Day.<br />\nIn speaking of athletic relations between the two institutions, Curly Byrd,<br />\nMaryland coach, in a letter said: \"Certainly as long as I have anything to do<br />\nwith the administration of affairs in the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, the cordial cooperation and pleasant friendship that now<br />\nexist between the two universities will<br />\nbe fostered to the limit of my ability.\"<br />\nThere is no possible denial of the fact<br />\nthat there is an agreeable, friendly spirit<br />\nexisting between the Hopkins and Maryland. That spirit will manifest itself in<br />\nthe game on Thursday.<br />\nWe sincerely hope, however, that the<br />\nstudents' spirit will not reach such a degree of overexuberance that property will<br />\nbe marred and destroyed in the pre-game<br />\ndemonstrations by members of both<br />\nschools. We call to the attention of the<br />\nHopkins men the fact that last year some<br />\ndeplorable things occurred in connection<br />\nwith these demonstrations. We implore<br />\nthat they hold their enthusiasm within<br />\ngentlemanly bounds. Games are not won<br />\nby marking up and destroying property<br />\nduring pre-game parades.<br /><br />\nPass The Motion<br />\nTHE motion before the Student Activities Council is of vital importance and<br />\nmust be adopted by that body. It is sound<br />\nand logical.<br />\nIt calls for these three vital things: (1)<br />\nthat students in only the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, School of Engineering, and<br />\nSchool of Business Economics shall be<br />\neligible for offices and membership in<br />\nactivities represented in the Student Activities Council; (2) that a New Plan<br />\nstudent can be eligible for participation<br />\nin-these activities until the conclusion of<br />\nwhat would be his fourth year of undergraduate residence; (3) that any member<br />\nof the three undergraduate schools who is<br />\nexpelled from the University by action of<br />\nStudent Council or University officials<br />\nshall automatically lose any post held in<br />\nany activity.<br />\nThis ruling, if passed, will exclude all<br />\nmembers of the College for Teachers from<br />\nmembership in any activity represented<br />\non the Student Activities Council.
