However, the University has a concurrent duty to stimulate interest in<br />\nthe affairs and problems which characterize the real<br />\nworld just beyond the cloistered halls of Homewood,<br />\nand in which students will soon have, if they do not<br />\nalready, a more than academic involvement.<br />\nAt present, Hopkins can look forward only to the<br />\npresentations of Secretary of Urban Affairs Robert<br />\nWeaver and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield,<br />\npoliticians who undoubtedly can do much to illuminate<br />\ndomestic and international issues, but who, of themselves, are unlikely to evoke controversy on this campus.<br />\nThis situation may be contrasted with the events of<br />\ntwo years ago, when PresideneJohnson twice descended<br />\nupon Hopkins, first during his campaign, and later in<br />\nthe spring to make what has come to be known as his<br />\n\"Baltimore speech\".<br />\nThat year also saw lectures by some of the foremost authorities on international affairs: Senators<br />\nWayne Morse and William Fulbright, Ambassador Henry<br />\nCabot Lodge, and then presidential advisor McGeorge<br />\nBundy.

Along with the Student Council, we urge<br />\na reconsideration of these rules, and a general reevaluation of the entire dormitory set-up.<br />\nWe hope to see initial talks taking place between<br />\nthe Council and the Administration, with the possibility<br />\nof opening them to all students in the form of a panel<br />\ndiscussion or a forum at a later time.<br />\nWe must point out that the academic freedom<br />\nwhich the letter applauds also appears to he facing this<br />\nname trend. The prime example here is the moving up<br />\nof the drop date.

However, in all this discussion, one essential fact seems<br />\nto have been neglected.<br />\nFaculty and Post doctoral students here at Hopkins do receive<br />\na 10% discount on books and<br />\nsupplies at the bookstore. Certainly, the purpose is to encourage these members of the community to purchase as many<br />\nbooks as possible in order to<br />\npursue their various scholarly<br />\ninterests. Such a discount then<br />\nlessens the financial strain on<br />\nthese individuals and encourages<br />\nthem to work and obtain ma-<br />\n<br />\nterials through the campus bookstore. No one could argue that<br />\nthis is not in the true spirit of<br />\nthe university.<br />\nWhy then are not students<br />\ngranted such an incentive? Certainly the cost of books is high<br />\nand especially in the case of<br />\nstudents on partial scholarship<br />\nmay be prohibitive. Which of us<br />\nhas not at one time or another<br />\nhesitated from purchasing that<br />\n\"recommended\" book?<br />\nIt is hard to imagine that the<br />\nHopkins student is financially<br />\nmore able to meet book costs<br />\nthan faculty members and I<br />\nwould suspect that the reverse<br />\nis true. Is it really necessary for<br />\nstudents to go to downtown<br />\nWashington, New York. and<br />\nother universities to find books<br />\nat a marked discount.<br />\nHopefully the current expansion of the University bookstore<br />\nis only the first step toward more<br />\nsubstantial bookstore reform.

Along with the Student Council, we urge<br />\na reconsideration of these rules, and a general reevaluation of the entire dormitory set-up.<br />\nWe hope to see initial talks taking place between<br />\nthe Council and the Administration, with the possibility<br />\nof opening them to all students in the form of a panel<br />\ndiscussion or a forum at a later time.<br />\nWe must point out that the academic freedom<br />\nwhich the letter applauds also appears to he facing this<br />\nname trend. The prime example here is the moving up<br />\nof the drop date. In both this instance and in the social<br />\ncontext above, the Administration seems to be forcing<br />\ndie students to conform to the inadequacies of the University, rather than amelioratiing the inadequacies for<br />\nthe benefit of the students.<br /><br />\n\u2014Coied2.42,0nds2nrc<br />\nExtra Academic<br />\nTo the Editors,<br />\nIt does seem that the main<br />\nconcerns to which the Newsletter<br />\nstaff direct themselves are indeed<br />\n\"extra academic.\" However, this<br />\nis not necessarily true of other<br />\nsegments of the student body.<br />\nD.

Undoubtedly<br />\nI have been living in a youthful<br />\nhonalee-world, for I would\u2022have<br />\nthought that any dedicated professor would welcome any addi-<br /><br />\ntional flexibility in the bureaucracy which would allow more<br />\nstudents to try his discipline.<br />\nThe<br />\nAmerican<br />\neducational<br />\nsystem is beset with enough obstacles to learning, without professors turning coal to the side<br />\nof educational restriction and ignorance.<br />\nSincerely.<br />\nMichael Fischer, '67<br /><br />\nBookstore Discount<br />\nTo the Editors,<br />\nRight from the start of this<br />\nsemester the Student Council has<br />\nfocused attention on different<br />\naspects of the Hopkins Bookstore. However, in all this discussion, one essential fact seems<br />\nto have been neglected.<br />\nFaculty and Post doctoral students here at Hopkins do receive<br />\na 10% discount on books and<br />\nsupplies at the bookstore. Certainly, the purpose is to encourage these members of the community to purchase as many<br />\nbooks as possible in order to<br />\npursue their various scholarly<br />\ninterests. Such a discount then<br />\nlessens the financial strain on<br />\nthese individuals and encourages<br />\nthem to work and obtain ma-<br /><br />\nterials through the campus bookstore. No one could argue that<br />\nthis is not in the true spirit of<br />\nthe university.<br />\nWhy then are not students<br />\ngranted such an incentive? Certainly the cost of books is high<br />\nand especially in the case of<br />\nstudents on partial scholarship<br />\nmay be prohibitive. Which of us<br />\nhas not at one time or another<br />\nhesitated from purchasing that<br />\n\"recommended\" book?<br />\nIt is hard to imagine that the<br />\nHopkins student is financially<br />\nmore able to meet book costs<br />\nthan faculty members and I<br />\nwould suspect that the reverse<br />\nis true. Is it really necessary for<br />\nstudents to go to downtown<br />\nWashington, New York. and<br />\nother universities to find books<br />\nat a marked discount.<br />\nHopefully the current expansion of the University bookstore<br />\nis only the first step toward more<br />\nsubstantial bookstore reform. A<br />\nmajor university like Hopkins<br />\nshould certainly encourage its<br />\nstudents and faculty alike to buy<br />\nany and all books that will add<br />\nto their intelectual development.<br />\nJames Jacobs,'69<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 14, 1966<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\n77/47 1<br /><br />\nAND WIEN NOW AeOUT<br />\nficAtALLy\u2014<br />\nDIP, Yell EVER 'SEE.<br />\n.NN_1%<br /><br />\n51/CAI BE411-77Fig. PirCHIMG,<br />\n1<br />\n1111404F-Th-RvAL-7.4\"4<br />\n/<br />\nF ti<br />\n7i/E. 7-211\u00b01-\"Ays,A1F<br />\n4u6-7<br /><br />\nSweetie Pie<br /><br />\nA Bird In The Bush<br />\nBy GERALD BRECHER<br />\nThe Dodgers earned their eight<br />\nthousand a piece without any<br />\nnoticeable sweat last week and<br />\nat last report were off on another fund raising tour, this one<br />\nto the fabled East, Japan, there<br />\nto do further business in the<br />\nname of sport.<br />\nThe Orioles \u2022 are still here<br />\nthough, and having won the<br />\nWorld Series, one imagines that<br />\nWith the 12 thousand simoleons<br />\nthus garnered for each of them,<br />\nthat they might buy a decent<br />\nbottle of champagne.
