This winter,<br />\ncriticism\u2014to use a more dignified word than \"kicking\"\u2014seems to be<br />\nparticularly directed against the members of the Board of Editors of<br />\nthis paper, and against the paper itself. There is excellent cause for<br />\ncriticism. We admit it, however much we regret it. The paper is not<br />\nwhat a periodical in any way connected with this University might be<br />\nand should be. Whose is the fault? And where is the remedy?<br />\nThe men who criticise the paper are made up of two classes. There<br />\nare some who, prompted by the best of motives and \"by real interest in the good of the paper,\"<br />\nwill come to one of the Editors and kindly tell him that the paper is going to the dogs.<br />\n\"Make it like the Lampoon,\" he says. \"Get drawings like the Tiger. Gee, whiz! why<br />\ndon't you have jokes like the Widow has ?\" Well, kind friend, give us thousands of students<br />\nas Harvard has and we'll try to give you a paper like the Lampoon.<br />\nThen someone else comes, usually to an Athletic Editor or Business Manager (who<br />\nhas nothing whatever to do with the matter), and suggests that that Editor write up a \"Joke<br />\nColumn.\" Write jokes! It's not easy work. Have you ever tried it? As another instance,<br />\nsomeone came up to the present writer and told him that \"rapt wonder,\" in the sonnet on<br />\nDoctor Furness, published in our last issue, was spelt \"wrapped wonder.\" The mere fact<br />\nthat the misprint was on the first page, and conspicuous to all who have eyes, did not concern<br />\nhim in the least. Why didn't he also remark that chickens have feathers? The news would<br />\nhave been fully as interesting. One can't help thinking, that, if every one who criticises the<br />\nproof-reading of this paper would read a quarter of a column of proof, what a typographically<br />\nfaultless paper we could turn out!<br />\nI said just now that there were two classes of critics. Of these I have given examples<br />\nof the first\u2014who kick for kicking's sake and who single out the NEWS-LETTER as their easiest<br />\nmark. The other class is different. It is made up principally of Alumni, who have been<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhr<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nformerly Editors of the paper. They know the difficulties of the work; they appreciate the<br />\nendeavor of the Board to make the paper a little better. We are all glad at any time to receive<br />\ncriticisms and suggestions from them. But, in all gentleness be it spoken, the inane twaddle of<br />\nthe critics of \"Literary Stuff,\" of \"Stale Athletic News,\" of \"Slushy Verse,\" is neither<br />\nwelcomed nor heeded. There is enough that is boring in running a paper without additional<br />\ninflictions from these well-meaning gentlemen.<br />\nHE recent semi-centennial of the Atlantic Monthly(to whom,in passing,<br />\nwe extend our respectful congratulations) calls to mind a rather<br />\nremarkable omission. It is strange that the foremost American<br />\nperiodical should not be on the shelves of the Johns Hopkins Library.<br />\nOne can understand the exclusion therefrom of the ephemeral<br />\ntrash of the ten-cent magazines.

He came to the<br />\nfront as the champion of nature. . He was<br />\nthe antithesis of Richardson. Always open,<br />\nbluff and natural, he had a great contempt for<br />\nRichardson's sadness, prudery and morality.<br />\nNature ruled Fielding. He followed all Nature's instincts. Coarse he often is, but immoral never. He believed in life as life. He<br />\nknew well the weaknesses of people. He was<br />\nin all a great, bluff, hearty bourgeois with an<br />\nimmortal genius. He was almost entirely devoid of literary vanity. lie is unruffled when<br />\nan audience is hissing one of his plays. If a<br />\nchapter in one of his novels proved distasteful to a friend he would not think of changing<br />\nit. His character was shown by his behavior<br />\nwhen he inherited some money. He promptly<br />\nretired to the country and set up house on a<br />\nlarge scale as a country squire. In three years<br />\nhe had run through it all. However, he still<br />\nhas courage, and back he comes to London to<br />\nfinish his law studies and to become a magistrate.<br />\nJoseph Andrews was his first novel, and on<br />\nits appearance was hailed as the greatest English novel ever written. It goes without saying that that title then did not begin to mean<br />\nwhat it did in later years. Here, as elsewhere,<br />\nFielding's perceptions are not of the most delicate. It has been said that Parson Trulliber,<br />\nin Joseph Andrews, was modeled after Mr.<br />\nOliver, Fielding's early teacher. In 1749 he<br />\npublished his great novel, The History of Tom<br />\nJones, today considered one of the great English novels. Comic, pathetic, tragic, at times<br />\nextremely vulgar, yet Tom Jones is true. It<br />\nrings out with a clear, free note. Here we<br />\nhave none of Richardson's clothes dummies,<br />\nmere puppets dragged through numberless<br />\nchapters, but we have a true character. Brave,<br />\ngenerous, forgiving, very human, we can sympathize with Tom Jones. I us attitude toward<br />\nBlifel is expressive of his character. Yet,<br />\nnever mind how much we like him, we can't<br />\nfind him a very admirable character.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough he is undoubtedly maltreated at<br />\nfirst, when we consider his environment we<br />\ncan expect no better of him; but on the whole,<br />\nisn't the incident with Molly, for example, just<br />\na trifle, out of the way? Wouldn't the story<br />\nbe just as good without it? Square and<br />\nThwackum are two characters\u2014the forerunners of Mr. Squeers. When Toni Jones breaks<br />\nhis arm Thwack= comes and tells him that<br />\nit is the judgment of heaven upon him for his<br />\nsins. Thwackum goes on thus, but Square<br />\npursues a different strain. He tells Jones that<br />\npain is the most contemptible thing in the<br />\nworld, but in talking thus to him one day he<br />\naccidentally bites his tongue and lets fall an<br />\noath or two. Thwackum makes the most of<br />\nthis, and they almost come to blows. Each is<br />\nthe defendant of doctrines which he knows<br />\nnothing about. So Fielding satirizes teachers<br />\nand learners.<br />\nAnd old Squire Western! When the surgeon is about to bleed Sophia she says that she<br />\nwill forgive him if he opens an artery.<br />\n\"Will you?\" cries Western. \"D\u2014n me if<br />\nI will! If he does thee the least mischief, d\u2014n<br />\nme if I don't ha' the heart's blood o' tin out.\"<br />\nYet the Squire is all right down at the bottom.<br />\nFielding reminds me of Dickens with his<br />\nqueer characters.<br />\nFielding is an unpolished diamond. Many<br />\npeople do not read him because they say he is<br />\nimmoral. Fielding is not immoral. The moral<br />\ntone of Joseph Andrew's, Tom Jones and<br />\nAmelia is much higher than that of some modern novels on sale today. Vulgar he undeniably is. All of his coarseness is on the surface. Ile draws men as they really were. his<br />\nnovels but express the social tone of his day.<br />\nLooking at things from his viewpoint, scenes<br />\nshocking to our twentieth century eyes seem<br />\nnothing out of the ordinary. All of Fielding's<br />\ncharacters are Epicureans. With him life is a<br />\ngreat thing. A broken head and an empty<br />\nstomach are a terrible combination to him,<br />\nbut he can rest.content with a broken head and<br />\na full stomach.<br />\nFielding shows us human nature. He knew<br />\nall the human passions, malicious, kindly, vulgar and refined\u2014he knew them all. Fielding<br />\ndelights in lifting for a moment the cloak that<br />\ncovers all these and revealing them to us in<br />\nall their nakedness. And they are naked. He<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ndoesn't hesitate to call a spade a spade, and<br />\ngenerally he would call it a mighty black one.<br />\nLet us look for a moment at the class of<br />\npeople who condemn Fielding. A lady once<br />\ninformed mc that she wouldn't let one of<br />\nFielding's novels come into her house. I<br />\nfound afterwards that her favorite authors<br />\nwere Marie Corelli and Oujda. Often the<br />\npeople who delight to bathe their souls in<br />\nveiled allusions recoil in disgust when a plain<br />\nfact is written down in a plain way. On the<br />\nother hand in the library of the well-read man<br />\nyou find Fielding, Richardson and Smollett<br />\nside by side with Thackeray, Dickens and<br />\nScott. And on that shelf where are Ouida<br />\nand Marie Corelli ? Fielding is unpolished,<br />\nand perhaps the better for it. Tom Jones, polished and with refined instincts, would resemble Lovelace too much. Cut all the profanity, all the uncultured words, all the vulgar<br />\nscenes out of Fielding, and where would we<br />\nbe? Ah, no! leave them in. Leave us Fielding. We have but one, and will never get another. Fielding was the first great English<br />\nnovelist. He is the best of his school. His<br />\ncharacters are full of humor and of life. His<br />\nstories do not drag, as do Richardson's. He<br />\ndoes not intrude personalities upon us, as does<br />\nSmollett. He delights in a rough scene and<br />\nexpects you to delight with him. He shows<br />\nup the weaknesses of people as well as their<br />\nmerits.<br />\nFielding stands alone in his own sphere,<br />\nwithout a peer. Let those who can appreciate<br />\nhim read him. Let those who cannot, keep<br />\naway. The ability to appreciate Fielding must<br />\nbe born in a man ; he can never acquire it.<br />\nW.<br />\n<br />\nFROM TWELVE TILL TWO.<br />\nAllen stalked angrily down the steps, stood<br />\na few minutes in doubt in the driving rain,<br />\nand then hailed a passing cab and bade the<br />\ndriver take him home quick.<br />\nSnugly ensconced in the hansom, he gave<br />\nfull vent to his jealous rage, cursed himself<br />\nover and over again for allowing an infatuation for \"a rag and a bone and a hank of hair\"<br />\nto run away with his wits and make a fool of<br />\nshim for six long months. Ile was a fool, and<br />\nthat was all there was to it\u2014a fool who, like<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nso many other fools, had put his trust in a<br />\nwoman. And he laughed bitterly.<br />\nHome was only a few blocks off, and his<br />\nwrath and self-contempt were still at the boiling point when he bounded out of the cab,<br />\nflung a coin to the driver and stalked up the<br />\nhigh steps, cursing himself, the weather and<br />\neverything else.<br />\nI I e stood in the vestibule a moment fum',ling for his keys, and at that instant his eyes<br />\nlighted on a bedraggled little cat that shrunk<br />\nback into a corner and mewed piteously.<br />\nSenselessly he drew back his foot and was<br />\nabout to kick the miserable creature out into<br />\nthe wet, from which it had evidently come to<br />\nthis place as a refuge, when another plaintive<br />\nmew cooled a little his unfeeling anger, and<br />\nhe merely pushed the kitten aside with his<br />\nfoot. Evidently, however, Kitty did not intend to be thus lightly deprived of a warm<br />\nplace to sleep, for as he turned his key in the<br />\nlock and swung back the door something shot<br />\npast him down the hall and up the stairs like<br />\na streak.<br />\nHis anger returned in a flash. He called<br />\nhis man, and together the two made a search<br />\nfor the little intruder. Not that Allen especially disliked cats, but tonight he was angry<br />\nenough to hate everybody and everything. So<br />\nAllen marched upstairs and down, followed by<br />\nthe mutely protesting major-domo, whose<br />\nrheumatism cried out against this imposition,<br />\nrigorously searching every closet and corner<br />\nin the large house, but not a sign of the cat<br />\ncould he find.<br />\nThis little vexation, however, lost itself<br />\nwhen the thought of his big trouble returned.<br />\nHe revolved the events of the night in his<br />\nmind as he stood dejectedly before the fire in<br />\nhis den, waiting while his man, caught unawares by his early return\u2014it was just midnight\u2014made ready his gown and slippers.<br />\nBeatrice Holliday had been all in all to him<br />\nduring the past few months, and he had been<br />\nconceited enough to think that his love was<br />\nnot wholly unrequited. And now here, on the<br />\nfirst opportunity she had had to \"make an<br />\nimpression,\" she had devoted her attentions<br />\nentirely, so it seemed to him, to the \"guest of<br />\nhonor,\" some young literary celebrity or other,<br />\nwhile he had been treated, or fancied he had,<br />\nwith a cold disdain that riled him to the mar-<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER..<br />\n<br />\nrow. That was why, under some pretext or<br />\nother, entirely overcome by a jealous rage and<br />\nblind anger, he had beaten a hasty retreat from<br />\nthe affair in the Holliday home, where he had<br />\nexpected to spend such a pleasant evening, back<br />\nto his own empty house and bachelor ways.<br />\n\"Fool,\" you say, \"if he had only stopped to<br />\nconsider.\" But when, pray tell me, gentle<br />\nreader, did ever a man in love stop to consider?<br />\nBy this time his things were prepared, and,<br />\nafter selecting from the rack an old, favorite<br />\npipe, that had been sadly neglected of late, and<br />\nfilling its crusted bowl with a choice mixture,<br />\nhe flung himself into an easy chair, already almost resigned to his lonely fate.<br />\nA wood fire and a pipe\u2014what strange pictures, sadly sweet pictures, do the dancing<br />\nflames takes unto themselves. And the tobacco<br />\nsmoke\u2014why is it that it forms itself always<br />\ninto shapes that suggest the woman? 0,Lady<br />\nNicotine, you are as much a matchmaker as<br />\nCupid himself! how many men have pictured<br />\ntheir bright future in the wreaths of the smoke<br />\nof their favorite briar, and then, emboldened,<br />\nhave sought out its fulfilment in the person<br />\nof sonic alluringly repellant bit of femininity !<br />\nSo it was with Allen. It was not five minutes before the soothing influence of the tobacco had changed the devoted attention \"to<br />\nmerely the natural hospitality of a born hostess,\" and the \"cold disdain\" into quiet pleasure. In fifteen minutes he was kicking himself\u2014mentally, of course, for he was far too<br />\ncomfortable to move\u2014for being just what I<br />\nknew he was all along\u2014a jealous fool\u2014and<br />\nhad almost determined to return to the reception.<br />\nThen, indeed, the full measure of his senselessness broke upon him. He would have been<br />\ngone over an hour. How explain his absence?<br />\nAt that moment Allen heard again a plaintive mew, but this time there was in it a note<br />\nof content. Then he felt sonic soft body rub<br />\nitself along his trousers, and, looking down,<br />\nhe saw that little rascal of a kitten, that, evidently awatt of the change that had come<br />\nabout in the temper of the master of the<br />\nhouse, had chosen to come out from its hiding<br />\nplace to plead for the petting to which it was<br />\nevidently accustomed.<br />\n<br />\nAllen did not kick the kitten this time, but<br />\nbent down and stroked its back, that, dried out<br />\nby now, had assumed quite an aristocratic<br />\ngloss. The cat looked up at him in a familiar<br />\nway, and then sprang up on his lap, and, curling up in a gray ball, dozed immediately off<br />\ninto a nap.<br />\nThe man made no attempt to disturb it, and<br />\nregarded it idly for a moment. Then he bent<br />\ndown and examined it carefully, and suddenly,<br />\nwith a whoop of delight, sprang up from his<br />\nchair, not forgetting the cat, however, which<br />\nhe deposited carefully on the seat.<br />\nFor five minutes he bustled around like a<br />\ncricket in a bottle, then, fully dressed, seized<br />\nthe kitten, dashed downstairs bearing it in his<br />\narms, flung open the door and rushed out into<br />\nthe rain.<br />\nTen minutes later Allen, wet and bedraggled, introduced himself into the crowded<br />\ndrawing room he had left about two hours<br />\nbefore, bearing in his arms a much surprised<br />\nAngora kitten, that blinked at the lights and<br />\nthe multitude of people around, When he had<br />\nrecovered his breath sufficiently the young Ananias blurted forth to the astonished Miss<br />\nHolliday : \"Your kitten\u2014went out to take a<br />\nsmoke\u2014saw him run down steps\u2014ran after<br />\nhim\u2014chased him miles\u2014caught him in an alley\u2014got wet\u2014here he is !\"<br />\nAnd the few smiling words of thanks told<br />\nhim all was well.<br />\n0.<br />\n<br />\nALUMNI NOTES.<br />\nMr. Richard MacSherry, '07, has returned<br />\nfrom abroad, where he has been for several<br />\nweeks.

Although Hopkins did not score,<br />\nfour times did our fellows come within 15<br />\nyards of the Green and Gold goal, and each<br />\ntime the ball was lost by some unfortunate<br />\naccident. On the other hand, Western Maryland was dangerously near our goal-line three<br />\ntimes. In the first half, after Hopkins had<br />\nheld them for two downs, Stoltz kicked a<br />\npretty field goal from the 15-yard line. But<br />\non the other two occasions our line did some<br />\nof the most remarkable work of the season<br />\nand held their opponents for downs.<br />\nStollenwerck received the Western Maryland kick-off, in the first half, and ran the<br />\nball back 10 yards.. Then Ridgely worked a<br />\nbeautiful forward pass, for another gain of 10<br />\nyards. At this stage of the game, however,<br />\nthe fates squarely turned their backs on the<br />\nBlack and Blue, for the next two plays resulted in a penalization of 15 yards and Hopkins was forced to kick. Western Maryland<br />\nthen worked the pigskin steadily down the<br />\nfield by line plunges, until they reached our<br />\n15-yard line, when after being held for two<br />\ndowns, Stolz kicked a field goal.<br />\nDuring the remainder of the half the Black<br />\nand Blue boys were continually on the offensive. They forced the ball down to their<br />\nopponents 20-yard line. where Stollenwerck<br />\nmade a vain attempt for a goal from field.<br />\nReceiving the punt-out in mid-field, our fellows again charged the field, carrying everything before them. Ridgely engineered a<br />\nbeautiful forward pass, and Chesney and Abel<br />\nplunged through the tackles for consistent<br />\ngains. But upon reaching the 15-yard line a<br />\nforward pass failed and Western Maryland<br />\nagain punted out of danger. Our backs continued to plug away at the line until they<br />\nwere held for downs on the 20-yard line, and<br />\nthe Western Maryland backs carried the ball<br />\nout of danger. The offensive work of Chesney, Abel, Ridgely and Musser was especially<br />\ngood in this half. The way the first two<br />\n\"hit\" the heavy Green and Gold line, and the<br />\nway the last two gathered in forward passes<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nexperienced. The boys seemed to lack energy<br />\nand snap; they went into the game as if it<br />\nwere theirs from the start, but they found, to<br />\ntheir sorrow, that Delaware was by no means<br />\nan easy proposition. The home team had a<br />\ngood chance to retrieve its lost fortunes, when<br />\nit faced the blue and yellow jerseys, but somehow, they failed in what was expected of<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe game was throughout a see-saw. First<br />\none team had the advantage, then another,<br />\nand both teams caine close to scoring more<br />\nthan once. Hopkins kicked to Delaware,<br />\nwho started to march right down the field<br />\ntowards the Hopkins goal. Whenever the<br />\nDelaware team had a good distance to go on<br />\nthe third down, they would work a forward<br />\npass, which was successful almost every time.<br />\nIn this way they worked the ball down to our<br />\nten-yard line, where they lost it on a fumble.<br />\nThen Hopkins started to carry the ball by<br />\nstraight line plunging. They got as far as<br />\nthe middle of the field, but were forced to<br />\nkick. Later on, however, they got the ball<br />\nagain, and took it to Delaware's twelve-yard<br />\nline by line-bucking, where they were held by<br />\ndowns. Shortly afterward the half ended<br />\nwith the ball in Hopkins' possession, and<br />\nwell down in Delaware's territory.<br />\nHopkins was picked to win in the second<br />\nhalf, but Delaware took a brace, and worried<br />\nthe home team with some excellent trick<br />\nplays, which almost resulted in a touchdown<br />\nmore than once. In this half, two excellent<br />\nforward passes, Stollenwerck to Ridgely, were<br />\naccomplished, and they added considerably to<br />\nthe amount of ground gained by the Black<br />\nand Blue team. Towards the end of the half,<br />\nHopkins got the ball near goal, and Stollenwerck attempted a goal from field, but the<br />\nball fell short. The game ended with the<br />\nball in our possession on Delaware's twentyyard line. If we had had about five more<br />\nHOPKINS 0, DELAWARE 0.<br />\nminutes\u2014but what is the use of saying \"if\" ?<br />\nThat the team did not lose, as did last<br />\nExcuse there may have been for the defeats<br />\nadministered by Stevens, Baltimore Medical year's team, is .a cause for slight satisfaction.<br />\nCollege and Mt. Washington, but no reason- We should have won, but victory is not our<br />\nable excuse can be offered for not humbling sole aim this year. The aim has been to get<br />\nthe pride of Delaware College on the ninth out a team which was composed of men who<br />\nof November. The eleven did not play as it have worked hard and have plenty of grit.<br />\nshould against a team which was just as light, This has been accomplished, for the team has<br />\nif not lighter than our team, and perhaps less grit, and the men have all worked faithfully.<br />\n<br />\nwere surely fine. At the beginning of the<br />\nsecond half, Hopkins again carried the ball<br />\ninto Western Maryland territory, but was soon<br />\nforced to punt. Then, by terrific line plays,<br />\nthe ball was steadily forced down the field<br />\nuntil Western Maryland held it for first down<br />\non our 8-yard line. But then they found that<br />\nthey were up against an extremely tough<br />\nproposition in the Hopkins line, for our fellows<br />\nheld nobly and after three vain attempts, the<br />\nball went over. Chesney punted out, but<br />\nWestern Maryland again worked their way<br />\nback and gained first down on our 9-yard line.<br />\nAgain the Hopkins' line held like a rock and<br />\nthe ball was ours on the 1-yard line. One<br />\nwould think that after such gruelling defense<br />\nwork our men would give up, but this was<br />\nnot the case, for after punting out, Chesney<br />\nintercepted a forward pass and made a beautiful run of about 40 yards. Things began to<br />\nlook rosy for Hopkins, but just then the<br />\nwhistle blew and the victory went to \"our<br />\nfriends the enemy.\" The game was undoubtedly the hardest and pluckiest fought of the<br />\nyear. If our fellows continue to fight with<br />\nsuch speed and grit, there is but little doubt<br />\nconcerning the success of the undergraduate<br />\nfootball team.<br />\nThe Hopkins line-up was as follows:<br />\nRight End\u2014Ridgely and Street.<br />\nRight Halfback\u2014Abel, McCabe and Stewart.<br />\nRight Tackle\u2014Stockton.<br />\nRight Guard\u2014Blanck.<br />\nCenter\u2014Maddren.<br />\nLeft Guard\u2014R.

There is<br />\nwhere the spirit of the team must assert itself.<br />\nIn that game everybody must be prepared to<br />\ngive his last bit of energy and vitality, of grit<br />\nand resourcefulness. Saint John's must be<br />\nbeaten, and to do this means that we have got<br />\nto fight until we can't stand up. Then we\u2014<br />\nwell, we won't lie down.<br />\n<br />\nCLASS FOOTBALL.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nall in all, the class game this year should be<br />\nvery close and the result will probably be in<br />\ndoubt until the referee's whistle blows for the<br />\nend of the game.<br />\n<br />\nTRACK.<br />\nFor Hopkins in the Home-Coming Games<br />\nat the Armory,the following scored: Gutman,<br />\nwith seven yards, second in the 220, and<br />\nBrenton, running from scratch, third in the<br />\nmile. Hopkins would doubtless have scored<br />\nagain in the 440 had not Graves, who was<br />\nrunning in third place on the homestretch,<br />\nlost his shoe within a few yards of the finish.<br />\nThe track team has made a beginning,<br />\nand though the showing in the Home-Coming<br />\nGames was, under the circumstances, all that<br />\nmight be expected, yet it gives little promise<br />\nof this year's team. As outlined in Mr.<br />\nBrenton's talk at the Y. M. C. A. reception,<br />\nthe chief aim this year is to build up a relay<br />\nteam, but for our part there is little connection between the scoring by a lacrosse player<br />\nin the 220 and by a confirmed distance runner and a relay team. To build up a relay<br />\nteam is fully realized by the track management, although the undergraduate, generally,<br />\nacts as if a ready-made team will spring up<br />\nwithout any work on his part. If Hopkins is<br />\nto have a relay team this year the undergraduate has got to forget that \"I can't run,\"<br />\nfor such stuff never wins at Penn. The relay<br />\nteam that goes to Franklin Field is not made<br />\nup between Easter and the first of May, but<br />\nis picked from the fellows that are now running around Homewood on Saturday mornings.<br />\n<br />\nThe time is now drawing near for the annual football game between the Juniors and<br />\nFreshmen, which will be played on December<br />\n6th, at Homewood. In spite of the fact that<br />\nbut two weeks remain for practice, the Freshmen have made no serious effort toward getting their team in good working order. They<br />\nhave played no games and have had but one<br />\nor two line-ups in the cage. On the other<br />\nhand, Captain Bailey, of the Junior team, has<br />\nbeen hard at work getting his men out and<br />\ndeveloping new material. Bailey has been<br />\ntrying his hand at quarter, which position he<br />\nwill probably play in the game.<br />\nThe Juniors' back-field and line are still<br />\nuncertain, but a number of men are trying for<br />\nthe positions and the team will undoubtedly<br />\nbe a strong one. The Freshmen will have a<br />\nstrong back-field, for Stollenwerck, McCabe<br />\nand Musser, who will probably make up this<br />\ndepartment, are good, experienced players.<br />\nTheir line, however, does not seem to be so<br />\nstrong.<br />\nThus far, the Juniors have played three<br />\ngames. The first they lost after a hard strug\u2014<br />\ngle to the Polytechnic Institute, 10 to 0.

The most important step<br />\nthe superior speed and team-work of the taken was the decision to hold three tourneys<br />\nCountry School won out. The Juniors will, this year, instead of two. Last year there<br />\nof course, greatly miss Michael, but, taking it was considerable difference in skill between<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nthe competitors in the major tourney, with<br />\nthe result that there were a number of hopeless tailenders who had no chance from the<br />\nbeginning. The same was the case, to a less<br />\ndegree, in the minor tourney. Under the new<br />\nconditions those who would have been at the<br />\nbottom of the major will be combined with<br />\nthe leaders of the minor to make the new intermediate tourney. The result should be<br />\nthree well contested and interesting tourneys,<br />\ngiving everyone a chance. They will be<br />\nshorter than before, an added advantage to<br />\nthose who are hard-pressed for time. It<br />\nwould be well for all who have not yet done<br />\nso to hand in their names to Mr. H. L. Russell. The matches will begin in about a week<br />\nfrom the issue of this number of the NEwsLETTER and will be played one game a week,<br />\nas formerly.<br />\nFrom present indications last year's members will have to hustle for their laurels, as<br />\nthere are fifteen or more new men, some of<br />\nwhom are reported to be very good.<br />\nThe Virginia match will come off as usual<br />\nduring the Easter holidays. We have good<br />\nhopes of winning the third time. The committee on correspondence matches has challenged Yale, Princeton and the University of<br />\nPennsylvania to matches by mail. It is hoped<br />\nthat one or more of these Universities will respond, so that we may show them, as we have<br />\nshown Virginia, that the sons of our Alma<br />\nMater can wield pawns and pieces as well as<br />\nmicroscope, test-tube, or lacrosse stick.<br />\nThe foregoing article was set up some time<br />\nago, and may be supplemented by the following:<br />\nThe tourneys will begin November 25. The<br />\nentries have been divided into three classes,<br />\nand the lists are on the bulletin board in the<br />\nbasement.

Mr. Ranft<br />\nfound it necesary to hand in his resignation<br />\non account of the press of University affairs<br />\nand illness at his home. We feel the loss of<br />\nMr. Ranft's work greatly, because it will be<br />\nnecessary to abahdon the new scheme which<br />\nwas just getting into good shape. However,<br />\nwe are very fortunate in having Mr. Thomas<br />\nDeC. Ruth at the University, who has consented to accept the leadership of the Glee<br />\nClub. Mr. Ruth was leader of this club two<br />\nyears ago, and it will be remembered that in<br />\nthat year the Glee Club, as well as the Man-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ndolin Club, was, in very good trim. If the<br />\nfellows will come out to two rehearsals a week<br />\nfrom now on, Mr. Ruth assures me that he<br />\ncan have his Club in good shape for a Christmas Trip. The Mandolin Club, as usual,<br />\nalready plays well enough to give a concert,<br />\nand therefore it is up to the men on the Glee<br />\nClub to fulfill their part of the contract. It<br />\nall rests with the Glee Club whether we have<br />\na Christmas Trip or not. On account of the<br />\nGlee Club not being in good condition, it has<br />\nbeen n,!cessary for the manager to cancel all<br />\nconcerts up to the Christmas Holidays. He<br />\nstill has pending, .however, engagements<br />\nfor the Christmas Trip, down the Eastern<br />\nShore. If the fellows will come out -regularly<br />\nand try hard to learn the pieces, we shall have<br />\na good Glee Club, as we 'have an excellent<br />\nman to conduct the Club. Some of the men<br />\nwho signed the contract at the first meeting<br />\nof the Musical Clubs this season have not<br />\nlived up to their part. What can you expect<br />\na leader to do when the fellows do not take<br />\nenough interest to come out regularly to the<br />\nrehearsals? We hope that the meetings that<br />\nare called for the next week or two will be<br />\nlarge and that things will get fairly started.<br />\n<br />\nCOTILLON CLUB.<br />\nThe first Cotillon Club dance is drawing<br />\nnear, and preparations for it have already<br />\nbeen begun. The Board of Governors plans<br />\nto have the best of everything\u2014music, programs, decorations, and refreshments. It<br />\nwants to do things on a. larger scale this year<br />\nthan ever before, and to do this it must be<br />\nassured of a larger attendance. As yet the<br />\nlist of members is not large enough to make<br />\npossible the plans which the Board has<br />\nadopted. The students should patronize these<br />\ndances more than they have in the past. The<br />\ndances are not only for the Upper-classmen<br />\nbut also for the Freshmen. Of course, the<br />\nFreshmen have not had the opportunity of<br />\nenjoying these dances as the older students<br />\nhave, and consequently do not know what<br />\npleasure they will miss by staying away from<br />\nthem. These dances are one aspect of the<br />\nsocial side of Hopkins life, and every one<br />\nshould take advantage of this opportunity.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nILGENFRITZ STUDIO<br />\nSuccessor to CUMMINS<br />\n<br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY<br />\n20 West Lexington Street<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nSpecial Discount to Students<br />\n<br />\n\"The Men's Store.\"<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLER 13113THEff<br />\n210 to 218 NORTH HOWARD ST.<br />\n<br />\nCARL C.

The first dance, it must be remembered, is to be given on Friday, December 6, just two weeks from today, and as yet<br />\nvery few members of the Cotillon Club have<br />\npaid their dues. Let us repeat that the<br />\ndances cannot be given unless more fellows<br />\nsubscribe and unless everyone pays up before<br />\nthe first dance.<br />\n<br />\nPURNELL ART CO.<br />\n224 North Howard<br />\n<br />\nStreet<br />\n<br />\nPICTURE MERCHANTS<br />\nPictures Framed Correctly at Moderate Prices<br />\nOnce a Customer\u2014Always a Customer<br />\nA Trial is All We Ask<br />\n<br />\nTHE A.

This winter,<br />\ncriticism\u2014to use a more dignified word than \"kicking\"\u2014seems to be<br />\nparticularly directed against the members of the Board of Editors of<br />\nthis paper, and against the paper itself. There is excellent cause for<br />\ncriticism. We admit it, however much we regret it. The paper is not<br />\nwhat a periodical in any way connected with this University might be<br />\nand should be. Whose is the fault? And where is the remedy?<br />\nThe men who criticise the paper are made up of two classes. There<br />\nare some who, prompted by the best of motives and \"by real interest in the good of the paper,\"<br />\nwill come to one of the Editors and kindly tell him that the paper is going to the dogs.<br />\n\"Make it like the Lampoon,\" he says. \"Get drawings like the Tiger. Gee, whiz! why<br />\ndon't you have jokes like the Widow has ?\" Well, kind friend, give us thousands of students<br />\nas Harvard has and we'll try to give you a paper like the Lampoon.<br />\nThen someone else comes, usually to an Athletic Editor or Business Manager (who<br />\nhas nothing whatever to do with the matter), and suggests that that Editor write up a \"Joke<br />\nColumn.\" Write jokes! It's not easy work. Have you ever tried it? As another instance,<br />\nsomeone came up to the present writer and told him that \"rapt wonder,\" in the sonnet on<br />\nDoctor Furness, published in our last issue, was spelt \"wrapped wonder.\" The mere fact<br />\nthat the misprint was on the first page, and conspicuous to all who have eyes, did not concern<br />\nhim in the least. Why didn't he also remark that chickens have feathers? The news would<br />\nhave been fully as interesting. One can't help thinking, that, if every one who criticises the<br />\nproof-reading of this paper would read a quarter of a column of proof, what a typographically<br />\nfaultless paper we could turn out!<br />\nI said just now that there were two classes of critics. Of these I have given examples<br />\nof the first\u2014who kick for kicking's sake and who single out the NEWS-LETTER as their easiest<br />\nmark. The other class is different. It is made up principally of Alumni, who have been<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nhr<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nformerly Editors of the paper. They know the difficulties of the work; they appreciate the<br />\nendeavor of the Board to make the paper a little better. We are all glad at any time to receive<br />\ncriticisms and suggestions from them. But, in all gentleness be it spoken, the inane twaddle of<br />\nthe critics of \"Literary Stuff,\" of \"Stale Athletic News,\" of \"Slushy Verse,\" is neither<br />\nwelcomed nor heeded. There is enough that is boring in running a paper without additional<br />\ninflictions from these well-meaning gentlemen.<br />\nHE recent semi-centennial of the Atlantic Monthly(to whom,in passing,<br />\nwe extend our respectful congratulations) calls to mind a rather<br />\nremarkable omission. It is strange that the foremost American<br />\nperiodical should not be on the shelves of the Johns Hopkins Library.<br />\nOne can understand the exclusion therefrom of the ephemeral<br />\ntrash of the ten-cent magazines. We do not greatly miss Harper's<br />\nor The Century. But that the Atlantic Monthly should not be sub* 44<br />\n\u2022<br />\n*<br />\n.

He came to the<br />\nfront as the champion of nature. . He was<br />\nthe antithesis of Richardson. Always open,<br />\nbluff and natural, he had a great contempt for<br />\nRichardson's sadness, prudery and morality.<br />\nNature ruled Fielding. He followed all Nature's instincts. Coarse he often is, but immoral never. He believed in life as life. He<br />\nknew well the weaknesses of people. He was<br />\nin all a great, bluff, hearty bourgeois with an<br />\nimmortal genius. He was almost entirely devoid of literary vanity. lie is unruffled when<br />\nan audience is hissing one of his plays. If a<br />\nchapter in one of his novels proved distasteful to a friend he would not think of changing<br />\nit. His character was shown by his behavior<br />\nwhen he inherited some money. He promptly<br />\nretired to the country and set up house on a<br />\nlarge scale as a country squire. In three years<br />\nhe had run through it all. However, he still<br />\nhas courage, and back he comes to London to<br />\nfinish his law studies and to become a magistrate.<br />\nJoseph Andrews was his first novel, and on<br />\nits appearance was hailed as the greatest English novel ever written. It goes without saying that that title then did not begin to mean<br />\nwhat it did in later years. Here, as elsewhere,<br />\nFielding's perceptions are not of the most delicate. It has been said that Parson Trulliber,<br />\nin Joseph Andrews, was modeled after Mr.<br />\nOliver, Fielding's early teacher. In 1749 he<br />\npublished his great novel, The History of Tom<br />\nJones, today considered one of the great English novels. Comic, pathetic, tragic, at times<br />\nextremely vulgar, yet Tom Jones is true. It<br />\nrings out with a clear, free note. Here we<br />\nhave none of Richardson's clothes dummies,<br />\nmere puppets dragged through numberless<br />\nchapters, but we have a true character. Brave,<br />\ngenerous, forgiving, very human, we can sympathize with Tom Jones. I us attitude toward<br />\nBlifel is expressive of his character. Yet,<br />\nnever mind how much we like him, we can't<br />\nfind him a very admirable character.<br /><br />\nAlthough he is undoubtedly maltreated at<br />\nfirst, when we consider his environment we<br />\ncan expect no better of him; but on the whole,<br />\nisn't the incident with Molly, for example, just<br />\na trifle, out of the way? Wouldn't the story<br />\nbe just as good without it? Square and<br />\nThwackum are two characters\u2014the forerunners of Mr. Squeers. When Toni Jones breaks<br />\nhis arm Thwack= comes and tells him that<br />\nit is the judgment of heaven upon him for his<br />\nsins. Thwackum goes on thus, but Square<br />\npursues a different strain. He tells Jones that<br />\npain is the most contemptible thing in the<br />\nworld, but in talking thus to him one day he<br />\naccidentally bites his tongue and lets fall an<br />\noath or two. Thwackum makes the most of<br />\nthis, and they almost come to blows. Each is<br />\nthe defendant of doctrines which he knows<br />\nnothing about. So Fielding satirizes teachers<br />\nand learners.<br />\nAnd old Squire Western! When the surgeon is about to bleed Sophia she says that she<br />\nwill forgive him if he opens an artery.<br />\n\"Will you?\" cries Western. \"D\u2014n me if<br />\nI will! If he does thee the least mischief, d\u2014n<br />\nme if I don't ha' the heart's blood o' tin out.\"<br />\nYet the Squire is all right down at the bottom.<br />\nFielding reminds me of Dickens with his<br />\nqueer characters.<br />\nFielding is an unpolished diamond. Many<br />\npeople do not read him because they say he is<br />\nimmoral. Fielding is not immoral. The moral<br />\ntone of Joseph Andrew's, Tom Jones and<br />\nAmelia is much higher than that of some modern novels on sale today. Vulgar he undeniably is. All of his coarseness is on the surface. Ile draws men as they really were. his<br />\nnovels but express the social tone of his day.<br />\nLooking at things from his viewpoint, scenes<br />\nshocking to our twentieth century eyes seem<br />\nnothing out of the ordinary. All of Fielding's<br />\ncharacters are Epicureans. With him life is a<br />\ngreat thing. A broken head and an empty<br />\nstomach are a terrible combination to him,<br />\nbut he can rest.content with a broken head and<br />\na full stomach.<br />\nFielding shows us human nature. He knew<br />\nall the human passions, malicious, kindly, vulgar and refined\u2014he knew them all. Fielding<br />\ndelights in lifting for a moment the cloak that<br />\ncovers all these and revealing them to us in<br />\nall their nakedness. And they are naked. He<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ndoesn't hesitate to call a spade a spade, and<br />\ngenerally he would call it a mighty black one.<br />\nLet us look for a moment at the class of<br />\npeople who condemn Fielding. A lady once<br />\ninformed mc that she wouldn't let one of<br />\nFielding's novels come into her house. I<br />\nfound afterwards that her favorite authors<br />\nwere Marie Corelli and Oujda. Often the<br />\npeople who delight to bathe their souls in<br />\nveiled allusions recoil in disgust when a plain<br />\nfact is written down in a plain way. On the<br />\nother hand in the library of the well-read man<br />\nyou find Fielding, Richardson and Smollett<br />\nside by side with Thackeray, Dickens and<br />\nScott. And on that shelf where are Ouida<br />\nand Marie Corelli ? Fielding is unpolished,<br />\nand perhaps the better for it. Tom Jones, polished and with refined instincts, would resemble Lovelace too much. Cut all the profanity, all the uncultured words, all the vulgar<br />\nscenes out of Fielding, and where would we<br />\nbe? Ah, no! leave them in. Leave us Fielding. We have but one, and will never get another. Fielding was the first great English<br />\nnovelist. He is the best of his school. His<br />\ncharacters are full of humor and of life. His<br />\nstories do not drag, as do Richardson's. He<br />\ndoes not intrude personalities upon us, as does<br />\nSmollett. He delights in a rough scene and<br />\nexpects you to delight with him. He shows<br />\nup the weaknesses of people as well as their<br />\nmerits.<br />\nFielding stands alone in his own sphere,<br />\nwithout a peer. Let those who can appreciate<br />\nhim read him. Let those who cannot, keep<br />\naway. The ability to appreciate Fielding must<br />\nbe born in a man ; he can never acquire it.<br />\nW.<br /><br />\nFROM TWELVE TILL TWO.<br />\nAllen stalked angrily down the steps, stood<br />\na few minutes in doubt in the driving rain,<br />\nand then hailed a passing cab and bade the<br />\ndriver take him home quick.<br />\nSnugly ensconced in the hansom, he gave<br />\nfull vent to his jealous rage, cursed himself<br />\nover and over again for allowing an infatuation for \"a rag and a bone and a hank of hair\"<br />\nto run away with his wits and make a fool of<br />\nshim for six long months. Ile was a fool, and<br />\nthat was all there was to it\u2014a fool who, like<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nso many other fools, had put his trust in a<br />\nwoman. And he laughed bitterly.<br />\nHome was only a few blocks off, and his<br />\nwrath and self-contempt were still at the boiling point when he bounded out of the cab,<br />\nflung a coin to the driver and stalked up the<br />\nhigh steps, cursing himself, the weather and<br />\neverything else.<br />\nI I e stood in the vestibule a moment fum',ling for his keys, and at that instant his eyes<br />\nlighted on a bedraggled little cat that shrunk<br />\nback into a corner and mewed piteously.<br />\nSenselessly he drew back his foot and was<br />\nabout to kick the miserable creature out into<br />\nthe wet, from which it had evidently come to<br />\nthis place as a refuge, when another plaintive<br />\nmew cooled a little his unfeeling anger, and<br />\nhe merely pushed the kitten aside with his<br />\nfoot. Evidently, however, Kitty did not intend to be thus lightly deprived of a warm<br />\nplace to sleep, for as he turned his key in the<br />\nlock and swung back the door something shot<br />\npast him down the hall and up the stairs like<br />\na streak.<br />\nHis anger returned in a flash. He called<br />\nhis man, and together the two made a search<br />\nfor the little intruder. Not that Allen especially disliked cats, but tonight he was angry<br />\nenough to hate everybody and everything. So<br />\nAllen marched upstairs and down, followed by<br />\nthe mutely protesting major-domo, whose<br />\nrheumatism cried out against this imposition,<br />\nrigorously searching every closet and corner<br />\nin the large house, but not a sign of the cat<br />\ncould he find.<br />\nThis little vexation, however, lost itself<br />\nwhen the thought of his big trouble returned.<br />\nHe revolved the events of the night in his<br />\nmind as he stood dejectedly before the fire in<br />\nhis den, waiting while his man, caught unawares by his early return\u2014it was just midnight\u2014made ready his gown and slippers.<br />\nBeatrice Holliday had been all in all to him<br />\nduring the past few months, and he had been<br />\nconceited enough to think that his love was<br />\nnot wholly unrequited. And now here, on the<br />\nfirst opportunity she had had to \"make an<br />\nimpression,\" she had devoted her attentions<br />\nentirely, so it seemed to him, to the \"guest of<br />\nhonor,\" some young literary celebrity or other,<br />\nwhile he had been treated, or fancied he had,<br />\nwith a cold disdain that riled him to the mar-<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER..<br /><br />\nrow. That was why, under some pretext or<br />\nother, entirely overcome by a jealous rage and<br />\nblind anger, he had beaten a hasty retreat from<br />\nthe affair in the Holliday home, where he had<br />\nexpected to spend such a pleasant evening, back<br />\nto his own empty house and bachelor ways.<br />\n\"Fool,\" you say, \"if he had only stopped to<br />\nconsider.\" But when, pray tell me, gentle<br />\nreader, did ever a man in love stop to consider?<br />\nBy this time his things were prepared, and,<br />\nafter selecting from the rack an old, favorite<br />\npipe, that had been sadly neglected of late, and<br />\nfilling its crusted bowl with a choice mixture,<br />\nhe flung himself into an easy chair, already almost resigned to his lonely fate.<br />\nA wood fire and a pipe\u2014what strange pictures, sadly sweet pictures, do the dancing<br />\nflames takes unto themselves.

It was not five minutes before the soothing influence of the tobacco had changed the devoted attention \"to<br />\nmerely the natural hospitality of a born hostess,\" and the \"cold disdain\" into quiet pleasure. In fifteen minutes he was kicking himself\u2014mentally, of course, for he was far too<br />\ncomfortable to move\u2014for being just what I<br />\nknew he was all along\u2014a jealous fool\u2014and<br />\nhad almost determined to return to the reception.<br />\nThen, indeed, the full measure of his senselessness broke upon him. He would have been<br />\ngone over an hour. How explain his absence?<br />\nAt that moment Allen heard again a plaintive mew, but this time there was in it a note<br />\nof content. Then he felt sonic soft body rub<br />\nitself along his trousers, and, looking down,<br />\nhe saw that little rascal of a kitten, that, evidently awatt of the change that had come<br />\nabout in the temper of the master of the<br />\nhouse, had chosen to come out from its hiding<br />\nplace to plead for the petting to which it was<br />\nevidently accustomed.<br /><br />\nAllen did not kick the kitten this time, but<br />\nbent down and stroked its back, that, dried out<br />\nby now, had assumed quite an aristocratic<br />\ngloss. The cat looked up at him in a familiar<br />\nway, and then sprang up on his lap, and, curling up in a gray ball, dozed immediately off<br />\ninto a nap.<br />\nThe man made no attempt to disturb it, and<br />\nregarded it idly for a moment. Then he bent<br />\ndown and examined it carefully, and suddenly,<br />\nwith a whoop of delight, sprang up from his<br />\nchair, not forgetting the cat, however, which<br />\nhe deposited carefully on the seat.<br />\nFor five minutes he bustled around like a<br />\ncricket in a bottle, then, fully dressed, seized<br />\nthe kitten, dashed downstairs bearing it in his<br />\narms, flung open the door and rushed out into<br />\nthe rain.<br />\nTen minutes later Allen, wet and bedraggled, introduced himself into the crowded<br />\ndrawing room he had left about two hours<br />\nbefore, bearing in his arms a much surprised<br />\nAngora kitten, that blinked at the lights and<br />\nthe multitude of people around, When he had<br />\nrecovered his breath sufficiently the young Ananias blurted forth to the astonished Miss<br />\nHolliday : \"Your kitten\u2014went out to take a<br />\nsmoke\u2014saw him run down steps\u2014ran after<br />\nhim\u2014chased him miles\u2014caught him in an alley\u2014got wet\u2014here he is !\"<br />\nAnd the few smiling words of thanks told<br />\nhim all was well.<br />\n0.<br /><br />\nALUMNI NOTES.<br />\nMr. Richard MacSherry, '07, has returned<br />\nfrom abroad, where he has been for several<br />\nweeks.

Although Hopkins did not score,<br />\nfour times did our fellows come within 15<br />\nyards of the Green and Gold goal, and each<br />\ntime the ball was lost by some unfortunate<br />\naccident. On the other hand, Western Maryland was dangerously near our goal-line three<br />\ntimes. In the first half, after Hopkins had<br />\nheld them for two downs, Stoltz kicked a<br />\npretty field goal from the 15-yard line. But<br />\non the other two occasions our line did some<br />\nof the most remarkable work of the season<br />\nand held their opponents for downs.<br />\nStollenwerck received the Western Maryland kick-off, in the first half, and ran the<br />\nball back 10 yards.. Then Ridgely worked a<br />\nbeautiful forward pass, for another gain of 10<br />\nyards. At this stage of the game, however,<br />\nthe fates squarely turned their backs on the<br />\nBlack and Blue, for the next two plays resulted in a penalization of 15 yards and Hopkins was forced to kick. Western Maryland<br />\nthen worked the pigskin steadily down the<br />\nfield by line plunges, until they reached our<br />\n15-yard line, when after being held for two<br />\ndowns, Stolz kicked a field goal.<br />\nDuring the remainder of the half the Black<br />\nand Blue boys were continually on the offensive. They forced the ball down to their<br />\nopponents 20-yard line. where Stollenwerck<br />\nmade a vain attempt for a goal from field.<br />\nReceiving the punt-out in mid-field, our fellows again charged the field, carrying everything before them. Ridgely engineered a<br />\nbeautiful forward pass, and Chesney and Abel<br />\nplunged through the tackles for consistent<br />\ngains. But upon reaching the 15-yard line a<br />\nforward pass failed and Western Maryland<br />\nagain punted out of danger. Our backs continued to plug away at the line until they<br />\nwere held for downs on the 20-yard line, and<br />\nthe Western Maryland backs carried the ball<br />\nout of danger. The offensive work of Chesney, Abel, Ridgely and Musser was especially<br />\ngood in this half.

The boys seemed to lack energy<br />\nand snap; they went into the game as if it<br />\nwere theirs from the start, but they found, to<br />\ntheir sorrow, that Delaware was by no means<br />\nan easy proposition. The home team had a<br />\ngood chance to retrieve its lost fortunes, when<br />\nit faced the blue and yellow jerseys, but somehow, they failed in what was expected of<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe game was throughout a see-saw. First<br />\none team had the advantage, then another,<br />\nand both teams caine close to scoring more<br />\nthan once. Hopkins kicked to Delaware,<br />\nwho started to march right down the field<br />\ntowards the Hopkins goal. Whenever the<br />\nDelaware team had a good distance to go on<br />\nthe third down, they would work a forward<br />\npass, which was successful almost every time.<br />\nIn this way they worked the ball down to our<br />\nten-yard line, where they lost it on a fumble.<br />\nThen Hopkins started to carry the ball by<br />\nstraight line plunging. They got as far as<br />\nthe middle of the field, but were forced to<br />\nkick. Later on, however, they got the ball<br />\nagain, and took it to Delaware's twelve-yard<br />\nline by line-bucking, where they were held by<br />\ndowns. Shortly afterward the half ended<br />\nwith the ball in Hopkins' possession, and<br />\nwell down in Delaware's territory.<br />\nHopkins was picked to win in the second<br />\nhalf, but Delaware took a brace, and worried<br />\nthe home team with some excellent trick<br />\nplays, which almost resulted in a touchdown<br />\nmore than once. In this half, two excellent<br />\nforward passes, Stollenwerck to Ridgely, were<br />\naccomplished, and they added considerably to<br />\nthe amount of ground gained by the Black<br />\nand Blue team. Towards the end of the half,<br />\nHopkins got the ball near goal, and Stollenwerck attempted a goal from field, but the<br />\nball fell short. The game ended with the<br />\nball in our possession on Delaware's twentyyard line. If we had had about five more<br />\nHOPKINS 0, DELAWARE 0.<br />\nminutes\u2014but what is the use of saying \"if\" ?<br />\nThat the team did not lose, as did last<br />\nExcuse there may have been for the defeats<br />\nadministered by Stevens, Baltimore Medical year's team, is .a cause for slight satisfaction.<br />\nCollege and Mt.

At the beginning of the<br />\nsecond half, Hopkins again carried the ball<br />\ninto Western Maryland territory, but was soon<br />\nforced to punt. Then, by terrific line plays,<br />\nthe ball was steadily forced down the field<br />\nuntil Western Maryland held it for first down<br />\non our 8-yard line. But then they found that<br />\nthey were up against an extremely tough<br />\nproposition in the Hopkins line, for our fellows<br />\nheld nobly and after three vain attempts, the<br />\nball went over. Chesney punted out, but<br />\nWestern Maryland again worked their way<br />\nback and gained first down on our 9-yard line.<br />\nAgain the Hopkins' line held like a rock and<br />\nthe ball was ours on the 1-yard line. One<br />\nwould think that after such gruelling defense<br />\nwork our men would give up, but this was<br />\nnot the case, for after punting out, Chesney<br />\nintercepted a forward pass and made a beautiful run of about 40 yards. Things began to<br />\nlook rosy for Hopkins, but just then the<br />\nwhistle blew and the victory went to \"our<br />\nfriends the enemy.\" The game was undoubtedly the hardest and pluckiest fought of the<br />\nyear. If our fellows continue to fight with<br />\nsuch speed and grit, there is but little doubt<br />\nconcerning the success of the undergraduate<br />\nfootball team.<br />\nThe Hopkins line-up was as follows:<br />\nRight End\u2014Ridgely and Street.<br />\nRight Halfback\u2014Abel, McCabe and Stewart.<br />\nRight Tackle\u2014Stockton.<br />\nRight Guard\u2014Blanck.<br />\nCenter\u2014Maddren.<br />\nLeft Guard\u2014R.

Hopkins would doubtless have scored<br />\nagain in the 440 had not Graves, who was<br />\nrunning in third place on the homestretch,<br />\nlost his shoe within a few yards of the finish.<br />\nThe track team has made a beginning,<br />\nand though the showing in the Home-Coming<br />\nGames was, under the circumstances, all that<br />\nmight be expected, yet it gives little promise<br />\nof this year's team. As outlined in Mr.<br />\nBrenton's talk at the Y. M. C. A. reception,<br />\nthe chief aim this year is to build up a relay<br />\nteam, but for our part there is little connection between the scoring by a lacrosse player<br />\nin the 220 and by a confirmed distance runner and a relay team. To build up a relay<br />\nteam is fully realized by the track management, although the undergraduate, generally,<br />\nacts as if a ready-made team will spring up<br />\nwithout any work on his part. If Hopkins is<br />\nto have a relay team this year the undergraduate has got to forget that \"I can't run,\"<br />\nfor such stuff never wins at Penn. The relay<br />\nteam that goes to Franklin Field is not made<br />\nup between Easter and the first of May, but<br />\nis picked from the fellows that are now running around Homewood on Saturday mornings.<br /><br />\nThe time is now drawing near for the annual football game between the Juniors and<br />\nFreshmen, which will be played on December<br />\n6th, at Homewood. In spite of the fact that<br />\nbut two weeks remain for practice, the Freshmen have made no serious effort toward getting their team in good working order. They<br />\nhave played no games and have had but one<br />\nor two line-ups in the cage. On the other<br />\nhand, Captain Bailey, of the Junior team, has<br />\nbeen hard at work getting his men out and<br />\ndeveloping new material. Bailey has been<br />\ntrying his hand at quarter, which position he<br />\nwill probably play in the game.<br />\nThe Juniors' back-field and line are still<br />\nuncertain, but a number of men are trying for<br />\nthe positions and the team will undoubtedly<br />\nbe a strong one. The Freshmen will have a<br />\nstrong back-field, for Stollenwerck, McCabe<br />\nand Musser, who will probably make up this<br />\ndepartment, are good, experienced players.<br />\nTheir line, however, does not seem to be so<br />\nstrong.<br />\nThus far, the Juniors have played three<br />\ngames.

Play will continue regularly every<br />\nweek until completed.<br /><br />\nINTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF<br />\nAMERICAN STUDENTS.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University has received<br />\nfrom the government of Uruguay, through its<br />\nMinister at Washington, an invitation to be<br />\nrepresented at an International Congress of<br />\nAmerican Students to be held in Montevideo,<br />\nJanuary 26 to February 2, 1908.<br /><br />\nThe Congress will be divided into the following sections: (1) Medicine; (2) Law;(3)<br />\nEngineering and Architecture;(4)Agriculture<br />\nand Zootechnics; (5) Commerce; (6) Secondary Studies.<br />\nSeveral general sessions will be held at<br />\nwhich the following subjects will be discussed<br />\nin addition to subjects of general interest to<br />\nAmerican students:<br />\n(a) Government universities and private<br />\nuniversities.<br />\n(b) Examinations and exemptions from<br />\nexaminations.<br />\n(e) Specialization and generalization of<br />\npreparatory studies.<br />\n(d) Elective and prescribed studies.<br />\n(e) Uniformity of courses in American<br />\nuniversities.<br />\n(0 Uniformity in academic degrees.<br />\n(g) Student participation in university<br />\nadministration.<br />\n(h) Students' scholarships.<br />\n(i) Traveling fellowships and scholarships.<br />\n(j) Physical exercises and international<br />\nathletic contests.<br />\n(k) Glorification of illustrious Americans.<br />\n(1) Affiliation with the Cordra Fratres, International Federation of Students.<br />\n(m) Formation of a League of American<br />\nStudents.<br />\n(n) Exchange of books, journals and reviews.<br />\n(o) Organization of Periodical Congresses<br />\nof American Students.<br /><br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nWe are very sorry to announce that since<br />\nthe last issue of the NEWS-LETTER the leader<br />\nof the Glee Club has resigned. Mr. Ranft<br />\nfound it necesary to hand in his resignation<br />\non account of the press of University affairs<br />\nand illness at his home. We feel the loss of<br />\nMr. Ranft's work greatly, because it will be<br />\nnecessary to abahdon the new scheme which<br />\nwas just getting into good shape. However,<br />\nwe are very fortunate in having Mr. Thomas<br />\nDeC. Ruth at the University, who has consented to accept the leadership of the Glee<br />\nClub. Mr. Ruth was leader of this club two<br />\nyears ago, and it will be remembered that in<br />\nthat year the Glee Club, as well as the Man-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ndolin Club, was, in very good trim. If the<br />\nfellows will come out to two rehearsals a week<br />\nfrom now on, Mr. Ruth assures me that he<br />\ncan have his Club in good shape for a Christmas Trip. The Mandolin Club, as usual,<br />\nalready plays well enough to give a concert,<br />\nand therefore it is up to the men on the Glee<br />\nClub to fulfill their part of the contract. It<br />\nall rests with the Glee Club whether we have<br />\na Christmas Trip or not. On account of the<br />\nGlee Club not being in good condition, it has<br />\nbeen n,!cessary for the manager to cancel all<br />\nconcerts up to the Christmas Holidays. He<br />\nstill has pending, .however, engagements<br />\nfor the Christmas Trip, down the Eastern<br />\nShore. If the fellows will come out -regularly<br />\nand try hard to learn the pieces, we shall have<br />\na good Glee Club, as we 'have an excellent<br />\nman to conduct the Club. Some of the men<br />\nwho signed the contract at the first meeting<br />\nof the Musical Clubs this season have not<br />\nlived up to their part. What can you expect<br />\na leader to do when the fellows do not take<br />\nenough interest to come out regularly to the<br />\nrehearsals? We hope that the meetings that<br />\nare called for the next week or two will be<br />\nlarge and that things will get fairly started.<br /><br />\nCOTILLON CLUB.<br />\nThe first Cotillon Club dance is drawing<br />\nnear, and preparations for it have already<br />\nbeen begun. The Board of Governors plans<br />\nto have the best of everything\u2014music, programs, decorations, and refreshments. It<br />\nwants to do things on a. larger scale this year<br />\nthan ever before, and to do this it must be<br />\nassured of a larger attendance. As yet the<br />\nlist of members is not large enough to make<br />\npossible the plans which the Board has<br />\nadopted. The students should patronize these<br />\ndances more than they have in the past. The<br />\ndances are not only for the Upper-classmen<br />\nbut also for the Freshmen. Of course, the<br />\nFreshmen have not had the opportunity of<br />\nenjoying these dances as the older students<br />\nhave, and consequently do not know what<br />\npleasure they will miss by staying away from<br />\nthem. These dances are one aspect of the<br />\nsocial side of Hopkins life, and every one<br />\nshould take advantage of this opportunity.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nILGENFRITZ STUDIO<br />\nSuccessor to CUMMINS<br /><br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY<br />\n20 West Lexington Street<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nSpecial Discount to Students<br /><br />\n\"The Men's Store.\"<br /><br />\nHUTZLER 13113THEff<br />\n210 to 218 NORTH HOWARD ST.<br /><br />\nCARL C.

The first dance, it must be remembered, is to be given on Friday, December 6, just two weeks from today, and as yet<br />\nvery few members of the Cotillon Club have<br />\npaid their dues.
