Departing from all precedent,<br />\nthe Musical club has decided to forget local talent and to attempt to<br />\nsign some nationally known band.<br />\nWith this in view, the club has made<br />\ncontacts with the orchestras of Floyd<br />\nRay and Edgar Hayes.<br />\nFloyd Ray's band has just returned<br />\nfrom an engagement on the west<br />\ncoast, where they played in the Hollywood Swing contest sponsored by the<br />\nAmerican Legion.

They<br />\nare now playing in the Warman Park<br />\nhotel in Washington. DC.<br />\nThe other band under consideration<br />\nis that of Edgar Hayes. The Hayes'<br />\ngroup is known throughout swingdom for its recordings of swing classics.

For the past two years before every examination session the issue has been raised, and last year<br />\nthe granting of a reading period to social science<br />\nseniors was acclaimed as a step in the right direction.<br />\nBut this step stands alone, either because the University lacks kinesthetic sense or because they overlook<br />\nor are oblivious to student necessity.<br />\nIt can certainly not be said that the studentrhrody<br />\nis oblivious to student necessity in this case. When<br />\nthe campus was polled last year, the results were almost unanimous in their sanction of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nproposal. And Lord knows that the NL has raised the<br />\nissue often enough since then.<br />\nThe possibility of concrete administration objection<br />\nto a change in schedule to permit a breathing spell<br />\nbetween classes and exams has been checked thoroughly<br />\nand found lacking. In discussion with various members<br />\nof the faculty it has been determined that the greatest<br />\nopposition factor would probably be increased expenditure by the University and the dormitory necessitated by a longer term, if a longer term proved<br />\nnecessary. However, this is only a probability, and no<br />\nconcrete objection to a change in schedule to permit<br />\na breathing spell between classes and exams has been<br />\nchecked thoroughly and found lacking.<br />\nBut the NEWS-LETTER cannot make concrete proposals to the administration. Our audience is the student body and the various groups which make ,it up.<br />\nAnd when we say \"reading periods\", we expect such as<br />\nthe Student council, ODK, ASU, and any other group<br />\nwith the interests of the whole of the Student body<br />\ntheoretically at heart to pick up their ears and listen.<br />\nNow, the Student council is busy with plans for<br />\nhospitalization, while the ASU is busy listening. However, ODK is not over-busy (if the Student council<br />\nis). ODK is truly an ideal group to assume responsibility for presentation of the reading period \"ideal\" to<br />\nthe administration.<br />\nAnd so the NEWS-LETTER suggests. And although<br />\nwe deem another poll or further listing of reading<br />\nperiod advantages unnecessary, we will attempt both<br />\nin the near future, if the Student council, and ODK<br />\nremain passive on the question.<br />\nPerhaps our hope lies with the Liberal club.<br />\n<br />\nThe struggle<br />\ngoes on<br />\n<br />\nEvery so often we vary our<br />\ndaily procedure of perusing<br />\nBaltimore's Sunpapers by<br />\ninvesting in the News-Post.<br />\nThis may be likened to going from bad to Hearst, but<br />\nwe find it not a bad policy<br />\nto inquire into what Hearst is doing to the country<br />\nevery once in a while. For there is no denying that a<br />\ngoodly percentage of the population of these United<br />\nStates hold Hearst as a guardian angel of Democracy;<br />\nand reading Hearst is reading the mind of the people<br />\nin as essential a degree as reading the CIO News.<br />\nAnd we find that Hearst is still pushing peace and<br />\nprotection even unto the US senate. He also pushes the<br />\nfortification of the Philippines rather than of Guam, a<br />\nproposal which both he and Rear Admiral Yates Stirling, USN retired, consider most unsound. Security in<br />\n<br />\nInvestment<br />\nin<br />\ninconsistency<br />\n<br />\nthe Orient is the keynote of the Hearst-Stirling thesis,<br />\nand abandonment by the United States of an \"empire\"<br />\nthey brand as futile and foolish. In their eyes, dropping<br />\nof the Phillipines would mean \"exposure of the American homeland to invasion by the hostile hordes of<br />\nAsia.\"<br />\n\"We are fortifying a pinpoint (Guam), and abandoning an empire\", say they.<br />\nSo not only does Hearst push peace, but he pushes<br />\nAmerican imperialism on the basis of protection. That<br />\nmaintaining an \"empire\" must eventually lead to the<br />\nsame strife that builds one, he seems to overlook, and<br />\nseemingly takes for granted our coming war with<br />\nJapan. He seems also to overlook three thousand miles<br />\nof ocean in stating that the Philippines are necessary<br />\nfor the defense of the American homeland.<br />\nNow, any interpretation of history, economic or<br />\notherwise, is necessarily inclusive of the fact that peace<br />\nand empire are irreconciliable. And although abandonment of the Phillipines might be economically unwise (although argument to the contrary is extremely<br />\nrational) there is no denying that as a safeguard<br />\nagainst war with Japan, getting out of the islands would<br />\nbe the most effective.<br />\nTo go on, we find Stuart Chase in an article entitled \"Keep Your Powder Dry\" in the current issue of<br />\nCosmopolitan magazine, a Hearst publication, listing<br />\namong forces that may lead the United States to war,<br />\n\"an effort to salvage our investments, trade or prestige<br />\nin the far east, and the assuming of an obligation to<br />\ndefend the Phillipines.\"<br />\nHearst suggests precisely this policy on the<br />\neditorial page of Monday's News-Post, at the same time<br />\nproposing peace to the US senate, at the same time<br />\npublishing Mr Chase's article in Cosmopolitan.<br />\nSuch inconsistencies demonstrate a definite lack of<br />\nuniform editorial policy, which leads us to believe<br />\nthat Hearst just \"ain't what he used to be?'<br />\n' Either that, or he is attempting in his publications<br />\nto convince his readers that he is attempting to lead the<br />\ncountry to war.<br />\nWe are pleased to note the<br />\nbusy fashion in which the<br />\nStudent council is delving<br />\ninto the problem of hospitalization of,the Johns Hopkins campus, and the nature<br />\nof the cooperation which<br />\nthey are receiving from other sources. Newest development is the consideration of insurance furnished by an<br />\noutside group. Whether such would be satisfactory<br />\nor not we shall not attempt to determine here.<br />\nBut we should like to offer up a prayer at this stage<br />\nin the game for the succesful realization of the Council's and the. students' hopes, for entirely too much<br />\nactivity on the part of the Council, the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nand other campus groups has come to naught. Practically every attempt by student groups to alter or improve University practice has proven but \"sound and<br />\nfury\", and has not even been given the consideration of<br />\nbeing branded idiotic.<br />\nNow, although there has been hearkening-back<br />\nheareabouts to the days when the University raised<br />\ntuition from $400 to $450, the extra fifty dollars to<br />\ncover all incidental fees, the student body as a whole<br />\ndoes not object to an additional fee, providing they<br />\nreally \"get something for it,\" as mentioned in last<br />\nweek's NEWS-LETTER. The Student council in attempting to put medical fees where they will do the most<br />\ngood is fulfilling an obligation assumed by it along<br />\nwith the assumption that it is a Student council. That<br />\na plan more practicable than the one now in use will<br />\nbe evolved is almost certain. And although we may<br />\nbe rushing the season, we feel it appropriate now to<br />\nhope for application of what is almost certain to be<br />\nmedical care of high enough standard for the Johns<br />\nHopkins university name.<br />\n<br />\nAn appeal<br />\nto the<br />\nUniversity<br />\n<br />\nThe morning Sun<br />\nThey take the morning Sun<br />\nwith their poached eggs and coffee.<br />\nIt works slow, like hemlock in small doses,<br />\nslow and easy.<br />\nThey stir black coffee with a silver spoon<br />\nengraved with old initials<br />\nand read it and makes things easy.<br />\nThey sit in the shade of yesterday's monuments<br />\nand give the starving unemployed<br />\na free state.

Of it he said \"I do not<br />\nbelieve that the change will be<br />\nbrought about by orderly constitutional means.

For the past two years before every examination session the issue has been raised, and last year<br />\nthe granting of a reading period to social science<br />\nseniors was acclaimed as a step in the right direction.<br />\nBut this step stands alone, either because the University lacks kinesthetic sense or because they overlook<br />\nor are oblivious to student necessity.<br />\nIt can certainly not be said that the studentrhrody<br />\nis oblivious to student necessity in this case. When<br />\nthe campus was polled last year, the results were almost unanimous in their sanction of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nproposal. And Lord knows that the NL has raised the<br />\nissue often enough since then.<br />\nThe possibility of concrete administration objection<br />\nto a change in schedule to permit a breathing spell<br />\nbetween classes and exams has been checked thoroughly<br />\nand found lacking. In discussion with various members<br />\nof the faculty it has been determined that the greatest<br />\nopposition factor would probably be increased expenditure by the University and the dormitory necessitated by a longer term, if a longer term proved<br />\nnecessary. However, this is only a probability, and no<br />\nconcrete objection to a change in schedule to permit<br />\na breathing spell between classes and exams has been<br />\nchecked thoroughly and found lacking.<br />\nBut the NEWS-LETTER cannot make concrete proposals to the administration. Our audience is the student body and the various groups which make ,it up.<br />\nAnd when we say \"reading periods\", we expect such as<br />\nthe Student council, ODK, ASU, and any other group<br />\nwith the interests of the whole of the Student body<br />\ntheoretically at heart to pick up their ears and listen.<br />\nNow, the Student council is busy with plans for<br />\nhospitalization, while the ASU is busy listening. However, ODK is not over-busy (if the Student council<br />\nis). ODK is truly an ideal group to assume responsibility for presentation of the reading period \"ideal\" to<br />\nthe administration.<br />\nAnd so the NEWS-LETTER suggests. And although<br />\nwe deem another poll or further listing of reading<br />\nperiod advantages unnecessary, we will attempt both<br />\nin the near future, if the Student council, and ODK<br />\nremain passive on the question.<br />\nPerhaps our hope lies with the Liberal club.<br /><br />\nThe struggle<br />\ngoes on<br /><br />\nEvery so often we vary our<br />\ndaily procedure of perusing<br />\nBaltimore's Sunpapers by<br />\ninvesting in the News-Post.<br />\nThis may be likened to going from bad to Hearst, but<br />\nwe find it not a bad policy<br />\nto inquire into what Hearst is doing to the country<br />\nevery once in a while. For there is no denying that a<br />\ngoodly percentage of the population of these United<br />\nStates hold Hearst as a guardian angel of Democracy;<br />\nand reading Hearst is reading the mind of the people<br />\nin as essential a degree as reading the CIO News.<br />\nAnd we find that Hearst is still pushing peace and<br />\nprotection even unto the US senate. He also pushes the<br />\nfortification of the Philippines rather than of Guam, a<br />\nproposal which both he and Rear Admiral Yates Stirling, USN retired, consider most unsound. Security in<br /><br />\nInvestment<br />\nin<br />\ninconsistency<br /><br />\nthe Orient is the keynote of the Hearst-Stirling thesis,<br />\nand abandonment by the United States of an \"empire\"<br />\nthey brand as futile and foolish. In their eyes, dropping<br />\nof the Phillipines would mean \"exposure of the American homeland to invasion by the hostile hordes of<br />\nAsia.\"<br />\n\"We are fortifying a pinpoint (Guam), and abandoning an empire\", say they.<br />\nSo not only does Hearst push peace, but he pushes<br />\nAmerican imperialism on the basis of protection. That<br />\nmaintaining an \"empire\" must eventually lead to the<br />\nsame strife that builds one, he seems to overlook, and<br />\nseemingly takes for granted our coming war with<br />\nJapan. He seems also to overlook three thousand miles<br />\nof ocean in stating that the Philippines are necessary<br />\nfor the defense of the American homeland.<br />\nNow, any interpretation of history, economic or<br />\notherwise, is necessarily inclusive of the fact that peace<br />\nand empire are irreconciliable. And although abandonment of the Phillipines might be economically unwise (although argument to the contrary is extremely<br />\nrational) there is no denying that as a safeguard<br />\nagainst war with Japan, getting out of the islands would<br />\nbe the most effective.<br />\nTo go on, we find Stuart Chase in an article entitled \"Keep Your Powder Dry\" in the current issue of<br />\nCosmopolitan magazine, a Hearst publication, listing<br />\namong forces that may lead the United States to war,<br />\n\"an effort to salvage our investments, trade or prestige<br />\nin the far east, and the assuming of an obligation to<br />\ndefend the Phillipines.\"<br />\nHearst suggests precisely this policy on the<br />\neditorial page of Monday's News-Post, at the same time<br />\nproposing peace to the US senate, at the same time<br />\npublishing Mr Chase's article in Cosmopolitan.<br />\nSuch inconsistencies demonstrate a definite lack of<br />\nuniform editorial policy, which leads us to believe<br />\nthat Hearst just \"ain't what he used to be?'<br />\n' Either that, or he is attempting in his publications<br />\nto convince his readers that he is attempting to lead the<br />\ncountry to war.<br />\nWe are pleased to note the<br />\nbusy fashion in which the<br />\nStudent council is delving<br />\ninto the problem of hospitalization of,the Johns Hopkins campus, and the nature<br />\nof the cooperation which<br />\nthey are receiving from other sources. Newest development is the consideration of insurance furnished by an<br />\noutside group. Whether such would be satisfactory<br />\nor not we shall not attempt to determine here.<br />\nBut we should like to offer up a prayer at this stage<br />\nin the game for the succesful realization of the Council's and the. students' hopes, for entirely too much<br />\nactivity on the part of the Council, the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nand other campus groups has come to naught. Practically every attempt by student groups to alter or improve University practice has proven but \"sound and<br />\nfury\", and has not even been given the consideration of<br />\nbeing branded idiotic.<br />\nNow, although there has been hearkening-back<br />\nheareabouts to the days when the University raised<br />\ntuition from $400 to $450, the extra fifty dollars to<br />\ncover all incidental fees, the student body as a whole<br />\ndoes not object to an additional fee, providing they<br />\nreally \"get something for it,\" as mentioned in last<br />\nweek's NEWS-LETTER. The Student council in attempting to put medical fees where they will do the most<br />\ngood is fulfilling an obligation assumed by it along<br />\nwith the assumption that it is a Student council. That<br />\na plan more practicable than the one now in use will<br />\nbe evolved is almost certain. And although we may<br />\nbe rushing the season, we feel it appropriate now to<br />\nhope for application of what is almost certain to be<br />\nmedical care of high enough standard for the Johns<br />\nHopkins university name.<br /><br />\nAn appeal<br />\nto the<br />\nUniversity<br /><br />\nThe morning Sun<br />\nThey take the morning Sun<br />\nwith their poached eggs and coffee.<br />\nIt works slow, like hemlock in small doses,<br />\nslow and easy.<br />\nThey stir black coffee with a silver spoon<br />\nengraved with old initials<br />\nand read it and makes things easy.<br />\nThey sit in the shade of yesterday's monuments<br />\nand give the starving unemployed<br />\na free state.

Of it he said \"I do not<br />\nbelieve that the change will be<br />\nbrought about by orderly constitutional means.
