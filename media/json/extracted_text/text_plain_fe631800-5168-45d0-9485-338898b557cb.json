Listen first to 'Marx:<br />\nThe materialistic concept of history starts<br />\nfrom the proposition that the production of<br />\nthe means to support human life . . is the<br />\nbasis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner<br />\nin which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes is dependent upon what is produced.<br />\nAnd now Beard:<br />\nI never believed that all history can or must<br />\nbe explained in economic' terms or any other<br />\nterms.

Marxism<br />\nIs religious passion and a method of making<br />\nhistory. Beardism is impartial approach and a<br />\nmethod of writing history.

The idealist might give full weight to<br />\neconomic interpretation; the thoroughgoing materialist might be a consistent advocate of democracy.<br />\nNow as a matter of fact (Beard writes)<br />\n<br />\nthere is no reason why an economic interpretation of the Constitution should be more<br />\n-0partisan than any other interpretation . . .<br />\n\"Don't let this get around,\" reIndeed, an economic analysis may be coldly<br />\nplied Mr Big, peering apprehenneutral.<br />\nsively over his shoulder,\" but the<br />\nBeard did not ignore Marx.

Listen first to 'Marx:<br />\nThe materialistic concept of history starts<br />\nfrom the proposition that the production of<br />\nthe means to support human life . . is the<br />\nbasis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner<br />\nin which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes is dependent upon what is produced.<br />\nAnd now Beard:<br />\nI never believed that all history can or must<br />\nbe explained in economic' terms or any other<br />\nterms.
