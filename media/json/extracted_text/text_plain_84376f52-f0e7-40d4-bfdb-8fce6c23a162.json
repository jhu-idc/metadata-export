Consequently<br />\nthe body of cinema criticism abounds<br />\nwith literature concerning film art as<br />\nmerely an extension of the language arts.<br />\nWhether this critical disposition<br />\nrepresents the mental bias of the \"reading<br />\nand seeing\" public or whether that public<br />\nobtains its discriminatory practices from<br />\nthe criticism that it reads is a question<br />\nthat I will not directly consider.<br />\nNonetheless I must confront the gut<br />\nreaction that most of the time the book<br />\nwill be better than the movie. Aptly<br />\nenough my experience with John<br />\nBoorrnan's film Deliverance made it my<br />\nturn to \"play the game\" and review my<br />\npersonal literary and filmic values. I had<br />\nread the novel a short time before on one<br />\nof those long nights when neither lover<br />\nnor best friend can make one feel that he<br />\nOeftverance and found it to 6e as bad a<br />\nnovel as people had told me. It was<br />\nexciting enough to maintain my interest,<br />\nand I read it in one sitting. This put me at<br />\na real disadvantage when I saw the film,<br />\nsince the very element that held both the<br />\nbook and the film together, the suspense,<br />\nwas no longer operating.<br />\nBurt, John, Lewis, Ed<br />\nI knew that Burt Reynolds would<br />\nsuddenly emerge from the undergrowth<br />\nand save his weaker comrades with one<br />\nsingle pluck of the bowstring. I also knew<br />\nthat Jon Voight would make it to the top<br />\nof the cliff and fell his toothless predator.<br />\nI therefore had to turn to more stylistic<br />\nelements and was appalled at James<br />\n<br />\nDickey's reduction of Lewis as a real<br />\ncharacter in the novel to the hard-ass<br />\nzombie of the screenplay. Bobby was<br />\nmuch too bright for his part, much too<br />\nbright. The ending was not satisfying<br />\neither: In the novel, man and nature<br />\nseemed reconciled, whereas in the film<br />\nthings just stop. Obviously Dickey's<br />\noutlook has grown more existential over<br />\nthe past ten years. As cinematically<br />\nadequate as the film was it completely<br />\nfell apart.<br />\nThe film stayed with me and haunted<br />\nme until I saw it again. I was still troubled<br />\nwith the shallow development of Lewis, a<br />\ncharacter whom I had great respect for in<br />\nthe book.(And he did not say,\"now it's<br />\nyour turn to play the game!\") Since I had<br />\nseen it before, however, I was better able<br />\nto see it simply as a film and not as an<br />\nimitation of the novel. It became<br />\nsomething purely visual: The river<br />\nbecame more violent, more swirling, more<br />\npowerful in its contradicting peacefulness<br />\nand turbulence. The mountain men<br />\nof the South that were too real to deny,<br />\nand yet somehow I had not seen them<br />\nbefore. The things were simply there in<br />\nthe film.<br />\nA second film<br />\nAt about the same time I saw Eric<br />\nRohmer's Chloe in the Afternoon, and<br />\nwith all respect to Vincent Canby of the<br />\nN. Y. Times, I found it to be one of the<br />\n\"silliest\" films that I had ever seen. The<br />\nnarrative structure is rather simple, and I<br />\nhave no quarrel with what the film is<br />\nabout. Fredrich (happy, train-riding, a<br />\nfather with another on the way, a French<br />\nsuburbanite) was basically content with<br />\nhis \"normal\" existence. He seemed<br />\nsatisfied with his occassional \"Walter<br />\n<br />\nMitty as seductor\" fantasies until he gets<br />\nhis chance at a real live seduction. Chloe<br />\nsuddenly emerges and presents him with<br />\nmany opportunities, all of which he<br />\nrebuffs. He finally resolves the conflict<br />\nbetween his fantasy and real lives when<br />\nactually faced with Chloe in the bed,<br />\nwaiting. He runs home to his wife, where<br />\nthey exchange stupid, idiotic dialogue<br />\nending with both of them in tears and<br />\nheading off to the bedroom.<br />\nPacing and images<br />\nAs cinema I found it incredibly<br />\nslow-paced, with little or no interesting<br />\ncamera work or editing. There was only<br />\none recurring visual image in the entire<br />\nfilm. Fredric pulls his shirt above his head<br />\nwhen playing with his children and again<br />\nwhen he begins pulling off his shirt before<br />\njoining Chloe in the bedroom. This<br />\nmotion obviously makes him recall his<br />\nchildren and causes him to run home.<br />\nLike Deliverance, Chloe... may have<br />\nsome greater interpretation beyond the<br />\nquality of objects used. Each frame in<br />\nRohmer's film can be said - to mean<br />\n<br />\nsomething beyond itself but this is not<br />\ntrue for Boorman's film. Deliverance is<br />\nvisual whereas Chloe... is literary.<br />\nChloe... is boring, but it is only boring<br />\nas a film. As a work of literature it is<br />\nextremely exciting. Rohmer is writing<br />\nwith pictures and for the film to be a<br />\nsuccess it likewise must be read.<br />\nPhysical and Mental Action<br />\nIn Deliverance the river is nothing but<br />\nthe river, the forest and the cliff are not<br />\nvisual representations of something else,<br />\nbut rather they stand as themselves. They<br />\nsignify nothing about the characters.<br />\n<br />\nThey are simply there. In Chloe....,<br />\nhowever, each frame is like a sentence<br />\ncomposed of visual signifiers. For<br />\ninstance the colors of Fredric's office, the<br />\ninstitutional blues, greens, and browns,<br />\nset off with the token modern paintings<br />\non the walls, stand as a frame-by-frame<br />\nreference by which we view Fredric. This<br />\nenvironment suggests something beyond<br />\nwhat is actually happening in the sphere<br />\nof the frame's action, Fredric's mental<br />\naction. In Deliverance any mental action<br />\nis suggested only by the physical action<br />\nitself.<br />\nThe fact that Rohmer makes use of a<br />\nvoice-over narrator and divides the film<br />\ninto a prologue and several distinct parts<br />\nalso point to a certain literary quality of<br />\nthe film. The visual conglomerates have<br />\ndifferent significations in differing parts<br />\nof the film.<br />\nDifferences<br />\nDeliverance forces us to see nature and<br />\nto see man and to see \u2022 w th?.y<br />\ns iman las . Ken man and<br />\nnature and forced them together and set<br />\nthe camera in front of the confrontation.<br />\nWith his camera, Rohmer has nature as<br />\nletters and words which reveal something<br />\nabout man. The river can obviously reveal<br />\nsomething about Lewis and Ed, but 'a<br />\nsnow-covered mountain would have<br />\nworked just as well. One could not take<br />\nFredric's office from the film and still<br />\nhave the character Fredric.<br />\nRohmer has \"written\" a film with a<br />\nvisual representational language that like<br />\na poem cannot be altered.

Palmer Jr.<br />\nIn August we returned to Kennedy and<br /><br />\nBy TOM TOTTEN<br />\nWhen a film is more or less the<br />\nstepchild of some sort of literary<br />\nundertaking, the initial and most obvious<br />\ncritical statement made about it is a<br />\ncomparison with its parent. Consequently<br />\nthe body of cinema criticism abounds<br />\nwith literature concerning film art as<br />\nmerely an extension of the language arts.<br />\nWhether this critical disposition<br />\nrepresents the mental bias of the \"reading<br />\nand seeing\" public or whether that public<br />\nobtains its discriminatory practices from<br />\nthe criticism that it reads is a question<br />\nthat I will not directly consider.<br />\nNonetheless I must confront the gut<br />\nreaction that most of the time the book<br />\nwill be better than the movie. Aptly<br />\nenough my experience with John<br />\nBoorrnan's film Deliverance made it my<br />\nturn to \"play the game\" and review my<br />\npersonal literary and filmic values. I had<br />\nread the novel a short time before on one<br />\nof those long nights when neither lover<br />\nnor best friend can make one feel that he<br />\nOeftverance and found it to 6e as bad a<br />\nnovel as people had told me. It was<br />\nexciting enough to maintain my interest,<br />\nand I read it in one sitting. This put me at<br />\na real disadvantage when I saw the film,<br />\nsince the very element that held both the<br />\nbook and the film together, the suspense,<br />\nwas no longer operating.<br />\nBurt, John, Lewis, Ed<br />\nI knew that Burt Reynolds would<br />\nsuddenly emerge from the undergrowth<br />\nand save his weaker comrades with one<br />\nsingle pluck of the bowstring. I also knew<br />\nthat Jon Voight would make it to the top<br />\nof the cliff and fell his toothless predator.<br />\nI therefore had to turn to more stylistic<br />\nelements and was appalled at James<br /><br />\nDickey's reduction of Lewis as a real<br />\ncharacter in the novel to the hard-ass<br />\nzombie of the screenplay. Bobby was<br />\nmuch too bright for his part, much too<br />\nbright. The ending was not satisfying<br />\neither: In the novel, man and nature<br />\nseemed reconciled, whereas in the film<br />\nthings just stop. Obviously Dickey's<br />\noutlook has grown more existential over<br />\nthe past ten years. As cinematically<br />\nadequate as the film was it completely<br />\nfell apart.<br />\nThe film stayed with me and haunted<br />\nme until I saw it again. I was still troubled<br />\nwith the shallow development of Lewis, a<br />\ncharacter whom I had great respect for in<br />\nthe book.(And he did not say,\"now it's<br />\nyour turn to play the game!\") Since I had<br />\nseen it before, however, I was better able<br />\nto see it simply as a film and not as an<br />\nimitation of the novel. It became<br />\nsomething purely visual: The river<br />\nbecame more violent, more swirling, more<br />\npowerful in its contradicting peacefulness<br />\nand turbulence. The mountain men<br />\nof the South that were too real to deny,<br />\nand yet somehow I had not seen them<br />\nbefore. The things were simply there in<br />\nthe film.<br />\nA second film<br />\nAt about the same time I saw Eric<br />\nRohmer's Chloe in the Afternoon, and<br />\nwith all respect to Vincent Canby of the<br />\nN. Y. Times, I found it to be one of the<br />\n\"silliest\" films that I had ever seen. The<br />\nnarrative structure is rather simple, and I<br />\nhave no quarrel with what the film is<br />\nabout. Fredrich (happy, train-riding, a<br />\nfather with another on the way, a French<br />\nsuburbanite) was basically content with<br />\nhis \"normal\" existence. He seemed<br />\nsatisfied with his occassional \"Walter<br /><br />\nMitty as seductor\" fantasies until he gets<br />\nhis chance at a real live seduction. Chloe<br />\nsuddenly emerges and presents him with<br />\nmany opportunities, all of which he<br />\nrebuffs. He finally resolves the conflict<br />\nbetween his fantasy and real lives when<br />\nactually faced with Chloe in the bed,<br />\nwaiting. He runs home to his wife, where<br />\nthey exchange stupid, idiotic dialogue<br />\nending with both of them in tears and<br />\nheading off to the bedroom.<br />\nPacing and images<br />\nAs cinema I found it incredibly<br />\nslow-paced, with little or no interesting<br />\ncamera work or editing. There was only<br />\none recurring visual image in the entire<br />\nfilm. Fredric pulls his shirt above his head<br />\nwhen playing with his children and again<br />\nwhen he begins pulling off his shirt before<br />\njoining Chloe in the bedroom. This<br />\nmotion obviously makes him recall his<br />\nchildren and causes him to run home.<br />\nLike Deliverance, Chloe... may have<br />\nsome greater interpretation beyond the<br />\nquality of objects used. Each frame in<br />\nRohmer's film can be said - to mean<br /><br />\nsomething beyond itself but this is not<br />\ntrue for Boorman's film. Deliverance is<br />\nvisual whereas Chloe... is literary.<br />\nChloe... is boring, but it is only boring<br />\nas a film. As a work of literature it is<br />\nextremely exciting. Rohmer is writing<br />\nwith pictures and for the film to be a<br />\nsuccess it likewise must be read.<br />\nPhysical and Mental Action<br />\nIn Deliverance the river is nothing but<br />\nthe river, the forest and the cliff are not<br />\nvisual representations of something else,<br />\nbut rather they stand as themselves. They<br />\nsignify nothing about the characters.<br /><br />\nThey are simply there. In Chloe....,<br />\nhowever, each frame is like a sentence<br />\ncomposed of visual signifiers. For<br />\ninstance the colors of Fredric's office, the<br />\ninstitutional blues, greens, and browns,<br />\nset off with the token modern paintings<br />\non the walls, stand as a frame-by-frame<br />\nreference by which we view Fredric. This<br />\nenvironment suggests something beyond<br />\nwhat is actually happening in the sphere<br />\nof the frame's action, Fredric's mental<br />\naction. In Deliverance any mental action<br />\nis suggested only by the physical action<br />\nitself.<br />\nThe fact that Rohmer makes use of a<br />\nvoice-over narrator and divides the film<br />\ninto a prologue and several distinct parts<br />\nalso point to a certain literary quality of<br />\nthe film. The visual conglomerates have<br />\ndifferent significations in differing parts<br />\nof the film.<br />\nDifferences<br />\nDeliverance forces us to see nature and<br />\nto see man and to see \u2022 w th?.y<br />\ns iman las . Ken man and<br />\nnature and forced them together and set<br />\nthe camera in front of the confrontation.<br />\nWith his camera, Rohmer has nature as<br />\nletters and words which reveal something<br />\nabout man. The river can obviously reveal<br />\nsomething about Lewis and Ed, but 'a<br />\nsnow-covered mountain would have<br />\nworked just as well. One could not take<br />\nFredric's office from the film and still<br />\nhave the character Fredric.<br />\nRohmer has \"written\" a film with a<br />\nvisual representational language that like<br />\na poem cannot be altered. Boorman has<br />\nplaced objects before the camera and<br />\nturned it on.
