He<br />\nhas not shelled peanuts and eaten hot dogs,in between noisy cheers<br />\nfor the football team. To many students he is familiar only as an<br />\norientation week speaker, who reappears during June Week to<br />\nlead the commencement parade and present diplomas. In between<br />\nthe first day and the last of their life at the Hopkins Dr Bowman<br />\nhas been, to a great number of Hopkins students, a removed dignitary. In his farewell address this morning Dr Bowman revealed<br />\nhimself to the assembly body as an educator familiar with the<br />\n'development of 7oung men as adjusted citizens as well as scholars.<br />\nThere has never been any doubt about Dr Bowman's ability<br />\nadministrator. Carlyle Barton, the president of the board<br />\nan<br />\nits<br />\npublicly recognized this talent of Dr Bowman. Mr<br />\ntrustees,<br />\nof<br />\nBarton explained in March of last year, shortly after the President<br />\nhad announced his plan to retire, \"we (the board of trustees) are<br />\nconfident that the University is in better shape today, through<br />\nyour efforts, than at any time in its history.\"<br />\nDr Bowman has accomplished his success at the Hopkins by<br />\nhis sincere, unfaltering dedication to his programs. As he explained<br />\nto the undergraduates this morning, among his standards for a<br />\nuseful citizen a personal discipline is required. A discipline that<br />\ncontinues to pursue the objectives of an adopted program rather<br />\nthan exhaust energy to counter personal criticism or censure.<br />\nDr Bowman has responded to the business of being the University's President with just such an attitude. He has not compromised his standards to please the superficial whiin of associates or the immature desires of the undergraduates.<br />\nWith the same silent dignity that has characterized his<br />\nadministration Dr Bowman retired from the student assembly<br />\nthis morning. For the students the retiring President left the<br />\nechoes of his sigplificant farewell address. To his successor Dr<br />\nDetlev Bronk he entrusts a growing heritage, the Hopkins tradition.<br />\n<br />\nINCONSTANT GLANCES<br />\nMigrant birds are gone and the squirrels, like the students,<br />\ngo quietly about their business. This is not the season when the<br />\nstands of Homewood,. field are filled with cheering football or<br />\nlacrosse fans. The green in front of Levering will not be crowded<br />\nwith students lunching. Students will not be studying on the<br />\nbenches on the balconies of Gilman Hall.<br />\nThis is the time when a student may survey the world and<br />\nbest understand his own place in it. That is, if we are ever to<br />\nunderstand our place in the world that the atomic bomb and<br />\ninternational frictions have so complicated.<br />\nTo the farmers living on the outskirts of our city, the men<br />\nIn broad brimmed hats that appear only to deliver their products<br />\nto the market or attend to city business, if is now certain that<br />\nit is not the little pleasures of the country that make life worth<br />\nliving here. Although it is the little pleasures that bring excitement for the casual visitors, it is the broad assurances that make<br />\nthe country for the constant country folks. There is no short cut<br />\nto appreciating these assurances. One must live with the winter<br />\nsnows, the cold frosts, and understand the land and the seasons to<br />\nappreciate the certainties. The smell of fresh hay or the flash of a<br />\nrobin in flight may offer momentary delight for the senses, but the<br />\ninner feeling that no matter how bitter or long the Winter these<br />\n\"inconstant glances\" will return for another Spring, offers an<br />\nunwavering inner certainty.<br />\nWe are told, and often our academic activity leads us to<br />\nbelieve,- that only a miracle can save us from the inevitable<br />\ndestruction of the atomic age. However, to feel the snow underfoot<br />\nand realize that there is both fire and ice in the earth, even as<br />\nthere must be in the stars overhead, is to have some sense of this<br />\ngreat assurance. The Winter silence that promises to cover the<br />\nHomewood campus suggests a reassuring sense of harmony.<br />\n<br />\nArt Museum<br />\nIs Forgotten<br />\nCampus Hall<br />\n<br />\n404A<br />\n<br />\nBr<br />\n<br />\nBy JEFF MILLER<br />\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art<br />\nlies just south of The Hopkins.<br />\nIn fact, the land on which it<br />\nstands was part of the original<br />\nHomewood campus. The student<br />\nwho seeks an education rather<br />\nthan one hundred and twenty-four<br />\ncredits will find the museum to<br />\nbe a cultural treasure house. As<br />\nthe avowed objective of the museum is to \"stress contemporary<br />\nart as the phase most closely<br />\nlinked with our world today\u2014<br />\n(and) to present as many phases<br />\nof art as possible\", nearly everyone's interests are touched in the<br />\nyearly program.<br />\nAn examination of this season's<br />\nprogram immediately eliminates<br />\nthe conception that a museum is<br />\na mausoleum-like place where pictures hing in whispered antisepticity. The concert series offers<br />\nFolk Songs by Libby Holman and<br />\nBach arias. The movie program<br />\nshows outstanding foreign films<br />\nand great American comedians<br />\nsuch as W C Fields and the Marx<br />\nBrothers. The gallery exhibition<br />\nranges from abstract and surrealist American art to Currier and<br />\nIves prints.<br />\nSupport Needed<br />\nMonetary support is a problem<br />\nhere, as in most institutions of<br />\nthis type. The city pays for upkeep and salaries, but this is the<br />\nonly use of public funds. The<br />\nfinancing of concerts, movies, lectures, and loan exhibitions is accomplished through membership<br />\nfees and gifts. The advantages of<br />\na museum member are multiple.<br />\nReduced rates on tickets for museum events, admission to special<br />\nfilms not open to the public, use<br />\nof the Member's Room and the<br />\nlibrary, and invitations to all previews and receptions are but a few<br />\nof the member's privileges. The fee<br />\nfor a full member is only ten dollars a year. Besides all of this, the<br />\nmember has the satisfaction of<br />\ncontributing to the cultural well<br />\nbeing of the community.<br />\n<br />\nde<br />\n<br />\nth<br />\nin<br />\n<br />\nJvsr140k AT<br />\nse,<br />\nfltive 'ttal KARP? tvri- smt,14 0/.1><br />\nCei) VP'5<br />\n01,46 ukafs Lorra HE'S CALEN6 U.S<br />\nP/NCL/S or PHYSICS'<br />\nscsigo<br />\ng<br />\ncofi 041 pf\" Rceri Ise U.00?

He<br />\nhas not shelled peanuts and eaten hot dogs,in between noisy cheers<br />\nfor the football team. To many students he is familiar only as an<br />\norientation week speaker, who reappears during June Week to<br />\nlead the commencement parade and present diplomas. In between<br />\nthe first day and the last of their life at the Hopkins Dr Bowman<br />\nhas been, to a great number of Hopkins students, a removed dignitary. In his farewell address this morning Dr Bowman revealed<br />\nhimself to the assembly body as an educator familiar with the<br />\n'development of 7oung men as adjusted citizens as well as scholars.<br />\nThere has never been any doubt about Dr Bowman's ability<br />\nadministrator. Carlyle Barton, the president of the board<br />\nan<br />\nits<br />\npublicly recognized this talent of Dr Bowman. Mr<br />\ntrustees,<br />\nof<br />\nBarton explained in March of last year, shortly after the President<br />\nhad announced his plan to retire, \"we (the board of trustees) are<br />\nconfident that the University is in better shape today, through<br />\nyour efforts, than at any time in its history.\"<br />\nDr Bowman has accomplished his success at the Hopkins by<br />\nhis sincere, unfaltering dedication to his programs. As he explained<br />\nto the undergraduates this morning, among his standards for a<br />\nuseful citizen a personal discipline is required. A discipline that<br />\ncontinues to pursue the objectives of an adopted program rather<br />\nthan exhaust energy to counter personal criticism or censure.<br />\nDr Bowman has responded to the business of being the University's President with just such an attitude. He has not compromised his standards to please the superficial whiin of associates or the immature desires of the undergraduates.<br />\nWith the same silent dignity that has characterized his<br />\nadministration Dr Bowman retired from the student assembly<br />\nthis morning. For the students the retiring President left the<br />\nechoes of his sigplificant farewell address. To his successor Dr<br />\nDetlev Bronk he entrusts a growing heritage, the Hopkins tradition.<br /><br />\nINCONSTANT GLANCES<br />\nMigrant birds are gone and the squirrels, like the students,<br />\ngo quietly about their business. This is not the season when the<br />\nstands of Homewood,. field are filled with cheering football or<br />\nlacrosse fans. The green in front of Levering will not be crowded<br />\nwith students lunching. Students will not be studying on the<br />\nbenches on the balconies of Gilman Hall.<br />\nThis is the time when a student may survey the world and<br />\nbest understand his own place in it. That is, if we are ever to<br />\nunderstand our place in the world that the atomic bomb and<br />\ninternational frictions have so complicated.<br />\nTo the farmers living on the outskirts of our city, the men<br />\nIn broad brimmed hats that appear only to deliver their products<br />\nto the market or attend to city business, if is now certain that<br />\nit is not the little pleasures of the country that make life worth<br />\nliving here. Although it is the little pleasures that bring excitement for the casual visitors, it is the broad assurances that make<br />\nthe country for the constant country folks. There is no short cut<br />\nto appreciating these assurances. One must live with the winter<br />\nsnows, the cold frosts, and understand the land and the seasons to<br />\nappreciate the certainties. The smell of fresh hay or the flash of a<br />\nrobin in flight may offer momentary delight for the senses, but the<br />\ninner feeling that no matter how bitter or long the Winter these<br />\n\"inconstant glances\" will return for another Spring, offers an<br />\nunwavering inner certainty.<br />\nWe are told, and often our academic activity leads us to<br />\nbelieve,- that only a miracle can save us from the inevitable<br />\ndestruction of the atomic age. However, to feel the snow underfoot<br />\nand realize that there is both fire and ice in the earth, even as<br />\nthere must be in the stars overhead, is to have some sense of this<br />\ngreat assurance. The Winter silence that promises to cover the<br />\nHomewood campus suggests a reassuring sense of harmony.<br /><br />\nArt Museum<br />\nIs Forgotten<br />\nCampus Hall<br /><br />\n404A<br /><br />\nBr<br /><br />\nBy JEFF MILLER<br />\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art<br />\nlies just south of The Hopkins.<br />\nIn fact, the land on which it<br />\nstands was part of the original<br />\nHomewood campus. The student<br />\nwho seeks an education rather<br />\nthan one hundred and twenty-four<br />\ncredits will find the museum to<br />\nbe a cultural treasure house. As<br />\nthe avowed objective of the museum is to \"stress contemporary<br />\nart as the phase most closely<br />\nlinked with our world today\u2014<br />\n(and) to present as many phases<br />\nof art as possible\", nearly everyone's interests are touched in the<br />\nyearly program.<br />\nAn examination of this season's<br />\nprogram immediately eliminates<br />\nthe conception that a museum is<br />\na mausoleum-like place where pictures hing in whispered antisepticity. The concert series offers<br />\nFolk Songs by Libby Holman and<br />\nBach arias. The movie program<br />\nshows outstanding foreign films<br />\nand great American comedians<br />\nsuch as W C Fields and the Marx<br />\nBrothers. The gallery exhibition<br />\nranges from abstract and surrealist American art to Currier and<br />\nIves prints.<br />\nSupport Needed<br />\nMonetary support is a problem<br />\nhere, as in most institutions of<br />\nthis type. The city pays for upkeep and salaries, but this is the<br />\nonly use of public funds. The<br />\nfinancing of concerts, movies, lectures, and loan exhibitions is accomplished through membership<br />\nfees and gifts. The advantages of<br />\na museum member are multiple.<br />\nReduced rates on tickets for museum events, admission to special<br />\nfilms not open to the public, use<br />\nof the Member's Room and the<br />\nlibrary, and invitations to all previews and receptions are but a few<br />\nof the member's privileges. The fee<br />\nfor a full member is only ten dollars a year. Besides all of this, the<br />\nmember has the satisfaction of<br />\ncontributing to the cultural well<br />\nbeing of the community.<br /><br />\nde<br /><br />\nth<br />\nin<br /><br />\nJvsr140k AT<br />\nse,<br />\nfltive 'ttal KARP? tvri- smt,14 0/.1&gt;<br />\nCei) VP'5<br />\n01,46 ukafs Lorra HE'S CALEN6 U.S<br />\nP/NCL/S or PHYSICS'<br />\nscsigo<br />\ng<br />\ncofi 041 pf\" Rceri Ise U.00?

Moreover, his<br />\nown reputation as a scientist, his<br />\nopinion of the importance of the<br />\ngraduate school and his belief in<br />\nthe de-emphasis of athletics, have<br />\nall served to link the leader who<br />\nhas not yet arrived on the scene<br />\nwith a tradition that is 72 years<br />\nold.<br />\nUnfortunately, this propensity to<br />\nidentify Bronk with the tradition<br />\nof the University has tended to<br />\nunderemphasize the<br />\npossibility<br />\nthat he himself may have some<br />\noriginal, and perhaps great, contributions to add to that tradition.<br />\nBecause the comments which<br />\nBronk has made have been very<br />\nComplimentary to Hopkins, there<br />\nare probably many, who do not<br />\nknow the man, who feel that he<br />\nIntends merely to add his second<br />\nto the trends already on foot here.<br />\nThis overemphasis of the importance of tradition is probably a<br />\nrelic of the attitude which Dr<br />\nSwisher says caused the University,<br />\nin 1937, to keep staring over its<br />\nshoulder into the \"good old days\"<br />\nof Hopkin's original greatness, instead<br />\nof looking into the future.<br />\n\u2014Sunpapers Photo<br />\nIt refuses to recognize that the<br />\ncharacter of the school is always<br />\naffected by the character of its<br />\npresident, and that the traditions<br />\nof the University have advanced<br />\nduring the last thirteen years.<br />\nSignificant of one of the Bowman administration's strongest<br />\nSciences, and the American Physi- aims\u2014that of overcoming departmental barriers--was the Swisher<br />\ncal Society.<br />\ncommittee, which was formed durHe is a member of the National<br />\ning the war to survey nation-wide<br />\nAcademy of Sciences, the American trelids in all fields<br />\nof higher learnPhilosophy Society, the British ing, with the object of reporting<br />\nPhysiological Society, the Ameri- directions which the Hopkins<br />\ncan Physiological Society, Society could take after the war.<br />\nIn forming this committee, the<br />\nof Experimental Biology and Medipresident was concerned with getcine, Philadelphia Neurological<br />\nting all the members of the faculSociety, American Neurological As- ty interested in the University<br />\nand<br />\nsociation and the Society of Natur- its whole set of problems.
