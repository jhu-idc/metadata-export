During the<br />\nsessions of 1886-89 he was one of<br />\nthat fortunate band who gathered<br />\nround Dr. Welch in the pathological laboratory attached to the hospital. Untroubled by class duties<br />\nor routine tasks they lived an ideal<br />\nuniversity life, learning from one<br />\nanother as well as from their distinguished leader, and. devoting<br />\nthemselves whole-heartedly to the<br />\n.kind of research work which at<br />\nthat time was somewhat rare in<br />\nthis country.

In a terrific battle in which she was heavily outweighed but<br />\nnever outplayed nor outfought, Hopkins held the big State team<br />\nto a single touchdown and refused to concede a victory to her traditional rival until the final whistle brought the 1917 season to a<br />\nclose. State was never more confident of defeating Hopkins and<br />\nyet never had to fight harder to retain her laurels as football champion of Maryland. Hopkins was desperate and fighting mad; State<br />\nwas heavy and confident. Hopkins was defeated, but certainly not<br />\ndisgraced.<br />\nHopkins started off like a house afire, she swept her heavy opponents<br />\noff their feet and rushed the ball to State's 20-yard line before State<br />\ncame to. When the State line stiffened, Winslow dropped back for a<br />\nplace-kick, Jones holding the ball. It was a difficult angle, but the<br />\nball sailed straight for the goal posts only to miss them by a couple<br />\nof inches. That narrow escape brought State to her feet; it made her<br />\nrealize that she was up against a tough proposition. State took the<br />\nball on her own 20-yard line and marched down the field with grim<br />\ndetermination to score a touchdown. It was Fletcher, the brilliant<br />\nback of the Farmer aggregation, that carried the ball over. During<br />\nthe rest of the half, Hopkins outplayed State and kept the play well<br />\ninto her opponent's territory, but never could take the ball within<br />\nscoring distance. Sadler was used up badly by the State ends and<br />\nbacks, but stuck it out gamely; he ran the team with snap and precision and was easily the star for the local team.<br />\nThe second half found both teams fighting desperately for the advantage and was featured by the constant exchange of punts. Jones'<br />\nvicious tackles were the outstanding feature of the play, until. Hopkins made that heroic stand on her 3-yard line just before the whistle<br />\nblew. The Hopkins team played about 100 per cent. better than it<br />\nhas played in any game this year, and fought like demons for every<br />\ninch of ground.

Finally Hopkins,<br />\non the lateral pass, Jones to Sheffey, blazed the way for nine yards<br />\nand then Sheffey gained eight<br />\nmore, running from kick formation, the pigskin being worked to<br />\nHopkins' 40-yard mark when the<br />\nperiod ended.<br />\nTwo forward passes were<br />\ngrounded by Winslow at the opening of the last period and then<br />\nthe teams again settled down,<br />\nplaying each other to a standstill<br />\nmost of the time.

Arthur<br />\nand MacDonald also did valiant<br />\nservice, and the trio smashed the<br />\nline for gains ranging from two<br />\nto eight yards.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DEC. 3, 1917.<br />\nAnother Change.<br />\n<br />\nThe period of uncertainty and<br />\nconfusion, incidental to the declaration of war last spring, seems<br />\nto re-echo down the restless history of THE NEWS-LETTER this<br />\nyear. Since the resignation last<br />\nMay of one of the most capable,<br />\nliberal and successful editors of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, no less than<br />\nthree men have succeeded to the<br />\noffice of editor-in-chief, the war<br />\nhaving called two of them away<br />\nalmost immediately after they<br />\nwere elected. THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nbelieves that it is a great tribute,<br />\nrather than a misfortune, that it<br />\nshould have been placed in the<br />\nhands of such patriotic, self-denying men that they could relinquish their high office to enter the<br />\nservice of their country. Henry<br />\nC. Evans and Mitchell B. Carroll<br />\nhave been denied the exercising of<br />\nan honored privilege that was due<br />\nthem, but only for the reason that<br />\nthey might perform a greater service--a service to their country.<br />\nIt is with peculiar regret, and<br />\nyet with pride, that THE NEWSLETTER has been obliged to forego<br />\nthe leadership of such men as<br />\nEvans and Carroll. It regrets, for<br />\nanxiety for its own welfare; it is<br />\nproud, for love of its country.<br />\nEvans had a wealth of experience<br />\nin e'ditorial work, was a prominent member of the Senior Class,<br />\nand would have had six months'<br />\nactive service on the western front<br />\nwhen he expected to return to the<br />\nUniversity this fall. Carroll had'<br />\nedited THE NEWS-LETTER in the<br />\nabsence of Evans and was well<br />\nfitted to succeed Evans when he<br />\ndecided to remain in France.<br />\nSo THE NEWS-LETTER has been<br />\nbrought to realize that our country is at war and that war is all<br />\nthat Sherman claimed for it. Not<br />\n<br />\nonly has it been deprived of two<br />\nmost promising and eminently<br />\nqualified editors, but also has its<br />\nstaff of associate editors been reduced by almost one-half. To tide<br />\nover the critical, condition in<br />\nwhich THE NEWS-LETTER has been<br />\nleft, it has been deeided to introduce a new system. The office<br />\nof managing editor has been made<br />\npermanent and will be filled by<br />\n\u2022 Carroll Stansbury, '20. The managing editor will have charge of<br />\nall current news and be responsible for what is known as the<br />\n\"makeup\" of the paper, while the<br />\neditor will be responsible for the<br />\neditorials and the general policy<br />\nof the paper. Stansbury served as<br />\nassistant editor under Carroll,<br />\nand as managing editor since Carroll has been called from college;<br />\nhe has shown that he is entirely<br />\ncapable of his new functions. THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, in spite of its \"wartorn\" board and inexperienced<br />\neditor-in-chief, aims to be worthy<br />\nof the honor Evans and Carroll<br />\nbrought it and to live up to the<br />\nhigh standard and noble traditions of the past.<br />\nDr. Mall.<br />\n<br />\nAn appreciation of Dr. Mall,<br />\nwhose services to the Medical<br />\nSchool were recently brought to<br />\nsuch an untimely end, appears<br />\nelsewhere in these columns under<br />\nthe name of a man who knew Dr.<br />\nMall personally and professionally, and who knew how to appreciate him. It is not for us to<br />\nsupplement Dr. Howell's tribute.<br />\nBut we cannot help but feel that,<br />\nseparate as we are from the Medical School, the loss of Dr. Mall<br />\nis our loss, too. Another great<br />\nman, one of the builders of Hopkins' world-wide reputation, has<br />\nbeen taken away. Following the<br />\nrecent demise of Dr. Clark, the<br />\ndeath of Dr. Mall marks the second great extra-war loss the University has suffered in the last few<br />\nmonths.<br />\nA Glorious Defeat.<br />\n<br />\nIt isn't exactly good form to<br />\nglory in defeat, and we frankly<br />\nadmit that we would have greatly<br />\npreferred to beat State and beat<br />\nthem badly. But, as a second<br />\nchoice, we could not have asked<br />\nfor greater satisfaction than what<br />\nwe derived from our defeat on<br />\nThanksgiving Day. Never has a<br />\nHopkins team fought harder, untold handicaps notwithstanding,<br />\nto win a football game. Every<br />\nsingle man on that team gave<br />\neverything that was in him and a<br />\nwhole lot more, and \"Dick\" Woodward may be proud to have led<br />\na team that was second to none in<br />\nspirit and fight and sportsmanship. The University honors the<br />\nmen that fought the greatest battle ever staged on Homewood<br />\nField: Woodward, Sadler, Sheffey, Jones, Stanley, Schmidt,Winslow, Hecht, McKeithen, Carey,<br />\nKatencamp, Wolfe, Cashell, Calkins. Boys, we're mighty damned<br />\nproud of you!<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nLetters From Men in Service. I<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nThis is a recent letter from Edward 0. Hulburt, who took the<br />\ndegree of A. B. here in 1911 and<br />\nthe degree of Ph. D. in 1915. He<br />\nwas for a time captain of the lacrosse team. Recently he has been<br />\nemployed in the physics laboratory of the Westinghouse Lamp<br />\nCompany at Bloomfield, N. J.<br />\nLast September he enlisted in the<br />\nSignal Corps and received a first<br />\nlieutenant's commission. He arrived in France about November 1.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is indebted to<br />\nDr. L. S. Hulburt, professor of<br />\nmathematics and father of \"Eddie\" Hulburt, for the publication<br />\nof this vividly interesting letter.<br />\nIt is as follows:<br />\nDEAR FATHER:<br />\nThis is our first day out, and I<br />\nwill start now and write a few<br />\nlines. We cannot mention names,<br />\nplaces or dates, so that I will have<br />\nto leave blanks and give general<br />\nstatements.<br />\nWe have some troops and a number of unattached officers on board,<br />\nand in company with some other<br />\nboats are ,being convoyed across.<br />\nMy room mate, E. H. Walker,<br />\nfirst lieutenant in the Ordnance<br />\nDepartment, is a very pleasant<br />\nfellow and we shall get along<br />\nfamously.<br />\nLast night all the officers were<br />\nassembled and given a talk on the<br />\nprecautions necessary. No lights<br />\nat all are allowed after dark\u2014no<br />\nsmoking outside\u2014you can smoke<br />\nin your rooms but must light up<br />\ndown below. This morning while<br />\nat breakfast Walker and I were<br />\nordered to the bridge as lookouts.<br />\nWe had an uneventful two-hour<br />\nwatch. Little did I ever suppose I<br />\nshould be standing on the bridge<br />\nwatching for evidences of submarines. We congratulated ourselves upon being on a transport<br />\nwhere we are given a share in the<br />\nwork\u2014this would perhaps not<br />\nhave happened had we been on a<br />\nregular liner.<br />\nOur schedule is two hours on the<br />\nbridge and six hours off. This<br />\ngives us 8 A. M. to 10 A. M., then<br />\nagain 4 P. M. to 6 P. M. and finally midnight to 2 A. M. As far as<br />\nwe know now this keeps up for the<br />\nremainder of the trip.<br />\nThis morning we had a life belt<br />\ndrill and were assigned stations<br />\nat the life rafts. We watched the<br />\nmen practicing passing ammunition, and watched the guns being<br />\noiled and prepared for action. Retired early, at 8 P. M., because<br />\nthere were no lights. On watch<br />\nagain at midnight\u2014it is rather impressive to see the dim outlines of<br />\nthe other ships of our convoy all<br />\ngliding along without lights. Was<br />\nnot relieved until 2.40\u2014the next<br />\nman overslept.<br />\nNext Day. Nothing of interest<br />\nhappened\u2014clear, blue sky, hard<br />\nsouth wind, warm, perhaps near<br />\ngulf stream. At the midnight<br />\nwatch found a sky and sea black<br />\nas ink, with a warm wind from<br />\n<br />\nthe south, almost a gale. I don't<br />\nunderstand why it is so warm\u2014I<br />\n-would think we were taking a<br />\nsoutherly course\u2014but as far as I<br />\nknow we have been coming directly east. At night we have nary a<br />\nlight, and we have to pick our way<br />\nthrough lines of sleeping soldier<br />\nboys\u2014they all sleep on deck out in<br />\nthe open in good weather.<br />\nThis morning we found that two<br />\ntransports and a destroyer had become separated from us during the<br />\nni.g,ht. A few hours after daylight<br />\nwe found them waiting for us\u2014<br />\nthey had gotten ahead in the dark.<br />\nIt is a clear, warm, sparkling Sunday\u2014and the men are singing and<br />\nskylarking around\u2014they seem to<br />\nhave gotten most of their sea legs<br />\nnow. We read magazines\u2014we appreciate the people who put stamps<br />\non them and sent them to us\u2014<br />\nthere must be about a cart load of<br />\nliterature on board\u2014it is a blessing to everyone.<br />\nThis afternoon we heard that we<br />\nwere to pick up a convoy of warships soon \u2014 the officers' mess<br />\nabounds with rumors\u2014perhaps we<br />\nare much further south than New<br />\nYork\u2014this would account for the<br />\nwarm weather\u2014but we don't<br />\nknow; we don't know our destination.<br />\nNext Day. This morning a man<br />\nwent overboard from our flagship,<br />\nwe all went slowly while they went<br />\nto pick him up. I hope they got<br />\nhim, but don't know. In the afternoon had lecture on military tactics am! a French conversation<br />\nclass.<br />\nNext Day. This morning we<br />\nfound that one of our transports<br />\nhad left us\u2014rumor says it went<br />\nback because of a leak. In the<br />\nafternoon the cruiser had target<br />\npractice, it fired several broadsides of six-inch guns\u2014a great<br />\nsight, looked just like the pictures.<br />\nWe are having cooler weather now<br />\n\u2014just like the days in Maine. I<br />\nam getting very tanned by the<br />\nwind. The meals are excellent and<br />\nWalker (my room mate) and I eat<br />\nprodigiously. The indications now<br />\nare that we aren't south, but are<br />\nin about the latitude of New York<br />\nand are pursuing a direct route<br />\nacross.<br />\nNext Day. This morning we<br />\nsighted an oil tank steamer\u2014one<br />\nof our destroyers ran over to sniff<br />\nat its heels and find out what it<br />\nwas doing\u2014these little destroyers<br />\nare like little dogs, the way they<br />\nrun around and nose into everything.

During the<br />\nsessions of 1886-89 he was one of<br />\nthat fortunate band who gathered<br />\nround Dr. Welch in the pathological laboratory attached to the hospital. Untroubled by class duties<br />\nor routine tasks they lived an ideal<br />\nuniversity life, learning from one<br />\nanother as well as from their distinguished leader, and. devoting<br />\nthemselves whole-heartedly to the<br />\n.kind of research work which at<br />\nthat time was somewhat rare in<br />\nthis country.

In a terrific battle in which she was heavily outweighed but<br />\nnever outplayed nor outfought, Hopkins held the big State team<br />\nto a single touchdown and refused to concede a victory to her traditional rival until the final whistle brought the 1917 season to a<br />\nclose. State was never more confident of defeating Hopkins and<br />\nyet never had to fight harder to retain her laurels as football champion of Maryland. Hopkins was desperate and fighting mad; State<br />\nwas heavy and confident. Hopkins was defeated, but certainly not<br />\ndisgraced.<br />\nHopkins started off like a house afire, she swept her heavy opponents<br />\noff their feet and rushed the ball to State's 20-yard line before State<br />\ncame to. When the State line stiffened, Winslow dropped back for a<br />\nplace-kick, Jones holding the ball. It was a difficult angle, but the<br />\nball sailed straight for the goal posts only to miss them by a couple<br />\nof inches. That narrow escape brought State to her feet; it made her<br />\nrealize that she was up against a tough proposition. State took the<br />\nball on her own 20-yard line and marched down the field with grim<br />\ndetermination to score a touchdown. It was Fletcher, the brilliant<br />\nback of the Farmer aggregation, that carried the ball over. During<br />\nthe rest of the half, Hopkins outplayed State and kept the play well<br />\ninto her opponent's territory, but never could take the ball within<br />\nscoring distance. Sadler was used up badly by the State ends and<br />\nbacks, but stuck it out gamely; he ran the team with snap and precision and was easily the star for the local team.<br />\nThe second half found both teams fighting desperately for the advantage and was featured by the constant exchange of punts. Jones'<br />\nvicious tackles were the outstanding feature of the play, until. Hopkins made that heroic stand on her 3-yard line just before the whistle<br />\nblew. The Hopkins team played about 100 per cent. better than it<br />\nhas played in any game this year, and fought like demons for every<br />\ninch of ground.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DEC. 3, 1917.<br />\nAnother Change.<br /><br />\nThe period of uncertainty and<br />\nconfusion, incidental to the declaration of war last spring, seems<br />\nto re-echo down the restless history of THE NEWS-LETTER this<br />\nyear. Since the resignation last<br />\nMay of one of the most capable,<br />\nliberal and successful editors of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, no less than<br />\nthree men have succeeded to the<br />\noffice of editor-in-chief, the war<br />\nhaving called two of them away<br />\nalmost immediately after they<br />\nwere elected. THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nbelieves that it is a great tribute,<br />\nrather than a misfortune, that it<br />\nshould have been placed in the<br />\nhands of such patriotic, self-denying men that they could relinquish their high office to enter the<br />\nservice of their country. Henry<br />\nC. Evans and Mitchell B. Carroll<br />\nhave been denied the exercising of<br />\nan honored privilege that was due<br />\nthem, but only for the reason that<br />\nthey might perform a greater service--a service to their country.<br />\nIt is with peculiar regret, and<br />\nyet with pride, that THE NEWSLETTER has been obliged to forego<br />\nthe leadership of such men as<br />\nEvans and Carroll. It regrets, for<br />\nanxiety for its own welfare; it is<br />\nproud, for love of its country.<br />\nEvans had a wealth of experience<br />\nin e'ditorial work, was a prominent member of the Senior Class,<br />\nand would have had six months'<br />\nactive service on the western front<br />\nwhen he expected to return to the<br />\nUniversity this fall. Carroll had'<br />\nedited THE NEWS-LETTER in the<br />\nabsence of Evans and was well<br />\nfitted to succeed Evans when he<br />\ndecided to remain in France.<br />\nSo THE NEWS-LETTER has been<br />\nbrought to realize that our country is at war and that war is all<br />\nthat Sherman claimed for it. Not<br /><br />\nonly has it been deprived of two<br />\nmost promising and eminently<br />\nqualified editors, but also has its<br />\nstaff of associate editors been reduced by almost one-half. To tide<br />\nover the critical, condition in<br />\nwhich THE NEWS-LETTER has been<br />\nleft, it has been deeided to introduce a new system. The office<br />\nof managing editor has been made<br />\npermanent and will be filled by<br />\n\u2022 Carroll Stansbury, '20. The managing editor will have charge of<br />\nall current news and be responsible for what is known as the<br />\n\"makeup\" of the paper, while the<br />\neditor will be responsible for the<br />\neditorials and the general policy<br />\nof the paper. Stansbury served as<br />\nassistant editor under Carroll,<br />\nand as managing editor since Carroll has been called from college;<br />\nhe has shown that he is entirely<br />\ncapable of his new functions. THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, in spite of its \"wartorn\" board and inexperienced<br />\neditor-in-chief, aims to be worthy<br />\nof the honor Evans and Carroll<br />\nbrought it and to live up to the<br />\nhigh standard and noble traditions of the past.<br />\nDr. Mall.<br /><br />\nAn appreciation of Dr. Mall,<br />\nwhose services to the Medical<br />\nSchool were recently brought to<br />\nsuch an untimely end, appears<br />\nelsewhere in these columns under<br />\nthe name of a man who knew Dr.<br />\nMall personally and professionally, and who knew how to appreciate him. It is not for us to<br />\nsupplement Dr. Howell's tribute.<br />\nBut we cannot help but feel that,<br />\nseparate as we are from the Medical School, the loss of Dr. Mall<br />\nis our loss, too. Another great<br />\nman, one of the builders of Hopkins' world-wide reputation, has<br />\nbeen taken away. Following the<br />\nrecent demise of Dr. Clark, the<br />\ndeath of Dr. Mall marks the second great extra-war loss the University has suffered in the last few<br />\nmonths.<br />\nA Glorious Defeat.<br /><br />\nIt isn't exactly good form to<br />\nglory in defeat, and we frankly<br />\nadmit that we would have greatly<br />\npreferred to beat State and beat<br />\nthem badly. But, as a second<br />\nchoice, we could not have asked<br />\nfor greater satisfaction than what<br />\nwe derived from our defeat on<br />\nThanksgiving Day. Never has a<br />\nHopkins team fought harder, untold handicaps notwithstanding,<br />\nto win a football game. Every<br />\nsingle man on that team gave<br />\neverything that was in him and a<br />\nwhole lot more, and \"Dick\" Woodward may be proud to have led<br />\na team that was second to none in<br />\nspirit and fight and sportsmanship. The University honors the<br />\nmen that fought the greatest battle ever staged on Homewood<br />\nField: Woodward, Sadler, Sheffey, Jones, Stanley, Schmidt,Winslow, Hecht, McKeithen, Carey,<br />\nKatencamp, Wolfe, Cashell, Calkins. Boys, we're mighty damned<br />\nproud of you!<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nLetters From Men in Service. I<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nThis is a recent letter from Edward 0. Hulburt, who took the<br />\ndegree of A. B. here in 1911 and<br />\nthe degree of Ph. D. in 1915. He<br />\nwas for a time captain of the lacrosse team. Recently he has been<br />\nemployed in the physics laboratory of the Westinghouse Lamp<br />\nCompany at Bloomfield, N. J.<br />\nLast September he enlisted in the<br />\nSignal Corps and received a first<br />\nlieutenant's commission. He arrived in France about November 1.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is indebted to<br />\nDr. L. S. Hulburt, professor of<br />\nmathematics and father of \"Eddie\" Hulburt, for the publication<br />\nof this vividly interesting letter.<br />\nIt is as follows:<br />\nDEAR FATHER:<br />\nThis is our first day out, and I<br />\nwill start now and write a few<br />\nlines. We cannot mention names,<br />\nplaces or dates, so that I will have<br />\nto leave blanks and give general<br />\nstatements.<br />\nWe have some troops and a number of unattached officers on board,<br />\nand in company with some other<br />\nboats are ,being convoyed across.<br />\nMy room mate, E. H. Walker,<br />\nfirst lieutenant in the Ordnance<br />\nDepartment, is a very pleasant<br />\nfellow and we shall get along<br />\nfamously.<br />\nLast night all the officers were<br />\nassembled and given a talk on the<br />\nprecautions necessary. No lights<br />\nat all are allowed after dark\u2014no<br />\nsmoking outside\u2014you can smoke<br />\nin your rooms but must light up<br />\ndown below. This morning while<br />\nat breakfast Walker and I were<br />\nordered to the bridge as lookouts.<br />\nWe had an uneventful two-hour<br />\nwatch. Little did I ever suppose I<br />\nshould be standing on the bridge<br />\nwatching for evidences of submarines. We congratulated ourselves upon being on a transport<br />\nwhere we are given a share in the<br />\nwork\u2014this would perhaps not<br />\nhave happened had we been on a<br />\nregular liner.<br />\nOur schedule is two hours on the<br />\nbridge and six hours off. This<br />\ngives us 8 A. M. to 10 A. M., then<br />\nagain 4 P. M. to 6 P. M. and finally midnight to 2 A. M. As far as<br />\nwe know now this keeps up for the<br />\nremainder of the trip.<br />\nThis morning we had a life belt<br />\ndrill and were assigned stations<br />\nat the life rafts. We watched the<br />\nmen practicing passing ammunition, and watched the guns being<br />\noiled and prepared for action. Retired early, at 8 P. M., because<br />\nthere were no lights. On watch<br />\nagain at midnight\u2014it is rather impressive to see the dim outlines of<br />\nthe other ships of our convoy all<br />\ngliding along without lights. Was<br />\nnot relieved until 2.40\u2014the next<br />\nman overslept.<br />\nNext Day. Nothing of interest<br />\nhappened\u2014clear, blue sky, hard<br />\nsouth wind, warm, perhaps near<br />\ngulf stream. At the midnight<br />\nwatch found a sky and sea black<br />\nas ink, with a warm wind from<br /><br />\nthe south, almost a gale. I don't<br />\nunderstand why it is so warm\u2014I<br />\n-would think we were taking a<br />\nsoutherly course\u2014but as far as I<br />\nknow we have been coming directly east. At night we have nary a<br />\nlight, and we have to pick our way<br />\nthrough lines of sleeping soldier<br />\nboys\u2014they all sleep on deck out in<br />\nthe open in good weather.<br />\nThis morning we found that two<br />\ntransports and a destroyer had become separated from us during the<br />\nni.g,ht. A few hours after daylight<br />\nwe found them waiting for us\u2014<br />\nthey had gotten ahead in the dark.<br />\nIt is a clear, warm, sparkling Sunday\u2014and the men are singing and<br />\nskylarking around\u2014they seem to<br />\nhave gotten most of their sea legs<br />\nnow. We read magazines\u2014we appreciate the people who put stamps<br />\non them and sent them to us\u2014<br />\nthere must be about a cart load of<br />\nliterature on board\u2014it is a blessing to everyone.<br />\nThis afternoon we heard that we<br />\nwere to pick up a convoy of warships soon \u2014 the officers' mess<br />\nabounds with rumors\u2014perhaps we<br />\nare much further south than New<br />\nYork\u2014this would account for the<br />\nwarm weather\u2014but we don't<br />\nknow; we don't know our destination.<br />\nNext Day. This morning a man<br />\nwent overboard from our flagship,<br />\nwe all went slowly while they went<br />\nto pick him up. I hope they got<br />\nhim, but don't know. In the afternoon had lecture on military tactics am! a French conversation<br />\nclass.<br />\nNext Day. This morning we<br />\nfound that one of our transports<br />\nhad left us\u2014rumor says it went<br />\nback because of a leak. In the<br />\nafternoon the cruiser had target<br />\npractice, it fired several broadsides of six-inch guns\u2014a great<br />\nsight, looked just like the pictures.<br />\nWe are having cooler weather now<br />\n\u2014just like the days in Maine. I<br />\nam getting very tanned by the<br />\nwind. The meals are excellent and<br />\nWalker (my room mate) and I eat<br />\nprodigiously. The indications now<br />\nare that we aren't south, but are<br />\nin about the latitude of New York<br />\nand are pursuing a direct route<br />\nacross.<br />\nNext Day. This morning we<br />\nsighted an oil tank steamer\u2014one<br />\nof our destroyers ran over to sniff<br />\nat its heels and find out what it<br />\nwas doing\u2014these little destroyers<br />\nare like little dogs, the way they<br />\nrun around and nose into everything.
