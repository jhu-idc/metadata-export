Second, the<br />\narea of work was exactly what I was looking for\u2014<br />\ntransistors and their application to computer systems.\"<br />\nIn June, 1955, Bob Thorpe decided to enter the IBM<br />\ntraining program, where he studied the corporate structure, its Divisions and products. He received technical<br />\ntraining in computer logic, programming, and components such as transistors, cores and tapes. By September, half his time was being devoted to an actual project;<br />\nby the following March,he was on that project full time.<br />\n\"Our job was to transistorize six servo-amplifiers for<br />\nthe airborne bombing-navigational system,\" he recalls,<br />\n\"and we completed the project in April.\"<br />\nIn Research (as in all of IBM), he works in a small<br />\ngroup. \"Our team consists of three E. E.'s and a technician. We start with an analysis of the over-all system<br />\nand its components. Then we use modern design techniques involving the latest devices to implement the<br />\nsystem.\" His group splits up occasionally to investigate<br />\nspecial phases of a project but reunites in frequent<br />\nsessions to coordinate their research activities.<br /><br />\nIn August, 1956, he<br />\nwas promoted to Associate Engineer. At that<br />\ntime he had been working on a design and development project for<br />\na D.C.sweep-restoring<br />\nsystem for transistorized airborne radar<br />\ndata presentation.
