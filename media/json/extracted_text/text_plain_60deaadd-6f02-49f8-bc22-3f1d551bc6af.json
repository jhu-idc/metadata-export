As long<br />\nas the black list remains in force it should apply equally to all campus<br />\nactivities.<br />\nBut should it remain in force? We believe not. The traditional<br />\npolicy of the University has been to allow the student complete liberty<br />\nso long as he remains a member of the University. President Gilman<br />\ninaugurated this principle and his successors have diligently followed<br />\nit. The student's time is his own; he is allowed to undertake the<br />\ncourses of his own choosing, with the exception of a very limited number of required subjects. Every opportunity is given him to specialize<br />\nin one branch of work if he sees fit. He is allowed to vary his courses<br />\nif he seeks a diversity of knowledge. There is only one requirement:<br />\nhe must keep up a certain standard of work. If he does not, he is<br />\ndismissed from college. This provision for expulsion is all that is<br />\nneeded. The black list finds no logical place in the existing scheme.<br />\nEach student is, and should be, compelled to keep up a high standard<br />\nof work.

The American<br />\nstudent body is represented in this<br />\ngroup by the National Students'<br />\nFederation of America.<br />\nThe International Confederation<br />\nof Students is the largest and most<br />\nrepresentative of a number of international student organizations.<br />\nThe most important of the others<br />\nare the International University<br />\nFederation for the League of Nations, the International Student<br />\nService, which is closely related in<br />\norigin and purpose to the World<br />\nStudent Christian Organization, and<br />\nthe Pax Romana. In spite of the<br />\nfact that so many of our country<br />\nstudents so unforunately do not<br />\nknow of the International Confederation of Students as well as the<br />\nother organizations of a similar nature, all these bodies are having a<br />\nconsiderable influence in forming<br />\nfuture public opinion.<br />\nAmong the graduate students at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is Mr.<br />\nStephen Podrabszky of Budapest.<br />\nHungary, who was head of the Foreign Office of the Hungarian National Student Body for several<br />\nyears. Mr. Podrabszky is a graduate<br />\nof the University of Economics, in<br />\nBudapest, and finished his doctor's<br />\ndissertation at that institute. He is<br />\nnow in Hopkins on a scholarship<br />\nand is doing graduate work in<br />\neconomics under Dr. Hollander. Mr.<br />\nPodrabszky is able to read, write,<br />\nand speak French, German, and<br />\nEnglish, in addition to his native<br />\nlanguage, Hungarian, and can read<br />\nItalian, Latin, and Greek. In view<br />\nof his position among the university<br />\nstudents of his native land, he was<br />\nvery prominent in international student affairs and was represented in a<br />\nnumber of the International Confederation's gatherings congresses,<br />\nand committee meetings held in various parts of the Eutopean continent.<br />\nMr. Podrabsky furnished a<br />\ngreat deal of interesting information<br />\nconsidering the fundamental structure and arrangement of the Confederation. As has been stated, the<br />\ninternational body is made up of national bodies. In Hungary, the Students' Nationalist Body is organized<br />\nin a manner similar to the governments of several European nations.<br />\nThere are officers for social, interior, economics, administrative, and<br />\ncultural affairs, and, last but not<br />\nleast, foreign affairs. This specialization is beginning to spread into<br />\nmost of the countries of_ Europe, but<br />\nit has originally developed in the<br />\nHungarian Student Organization<br />\nwhich is usually accepted as a model. Mr. Podrabszky was head of the<br />\nforeign office of that organization.<br />\nAmong the aims of the International Confederation of Students<br />\nare:<br />\n1. To bring students of different<br />\nnationalities together in order to<br />\nmake them acquainted with ideas of<br />\ntheir respective countries and so<br />\nthat they may discuss problems of<br />\nthe present and future.<br />\n2. To train students for future<br />\nleadership.<br />\n3. To enable students to visit different countries by the holding of<br />\ncongresses and by travelling. (This<br />\nis made possible by the fact that the<br />\nnational organizations are able to<br />\nobtain living facilities for travelling<br />\nstudents, and transportation expenses are reduced 50 per cent.)<br />\n4. To provide for exchanges of<br />\nbooks between students of different<br />\ncountries.<br />\n5.

The necessity of relating a<br />\nsignificant event in a limited number<br />\nof words, occasioned by the amount<br />\nof space available in the paper and<br />\nthe costliness of telegraph and cable<br />\ntolls, makes it extremely difficult to<br />\nwrite the story so as to give exactly<br />\nthe proper impression of the happening. This difficulty is accentuated by the dependence of many<br />\nreaders upon the headlines, which<br />\naccordingly must attempt to express<br />\nthe meaning of a long story in less<br />\nthan forty words.<br />\nIn the course of the evening Mr.<br />\nJohnson asked Dr. French \"What<br />\nis education ?\" The librarian replied<br />\nthat he had recently and publicly<br />\nadmitted he hadn't the slightest<br />\nidea what it was. Mr. Johnson suggested that if a paper is to be an<br />\neducating force it must bring its<br />\nreaders the sort of news that will<br />\nbroaden their horizon and enable<br />\nthem to approach closer to the truth<br />\non the matters to which it pertains.<br />\nSince no paper can, for practical<br />\nconsiderations, print all the news it<br />\ngathers every day, it must assume<br />\nresponsibility for choosing the<br />\nstories it will use and the amount<br />\nand location of space it will give to<br />\nthem.<br />\nMr. Johnson said that the propagation of a definite doctrine, while<br />\nit may be educative, is not purely<br />\njournalistic, and that the introduction of a frankly educational purpose into its news columns is fatal<br />\nto a paper. Strict adherence to the<br />\noutward aspects of a situation is<br />\napt to carry a surprising amount of<br />\nits spirit and significance. The reporter must keep himself and his<br />\nsheet's editorial policy out of the<br />\nnews, for a paper's failure to give<br />\nan uncolored version of happenings<br />\nmeasures its failure to be an educational force.<br />\n<br />\nSTETSON CLOTHES<br />\nfor<br />\n<br />\ncollege lfen<br />\n<br />\nNationally<br />\n<br />\nJustly<br />\n<br />\nKnown<br />\n<br />\nFamous<br />\n<br />\nMADE FOR YOU<br />\n<br />\nFOUR NORTH HOWARD STREET<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n-17//1<br />\n<br />\nHear Ye!

The American<br />\nstudent body is represented in this<br />\ngroup by the National Students'<br />\nFederation of America.<br />\nThe International Confederation<br />\nof Students is the largest and most<br />\nrepresentative of a number of international student organizations.<br />\nThe most important of the others<br />\nare the International University<br />\nFederation for the League of Nations, the International Student<br />\nService, which is closely related in<br />\norigin and purpose to the World<br />\nStudent Christian Organization, and<br />\nthe Pax Romana. In spite of the<br />\nfact that so many of our country<br />\nstudents so unforunately do not<br />\nknow of the International Confederation of Students as well as the<br />\nother organizations of a similar nature, all these bodies are having a<br />\nconsiderable influence in forming<br />\nfuture public opinion.<br />\nAmong the graduate students at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is Mr.<br />\nStephen Podrabszky of Budapest.<br />\nHungary, who was head of the Foreign Office of the Hungarian National Student Body for several<br />\nyears. Mr. Podrabszky is a graduate<br />\nof the University of Economics, in<br />\nBudapest, and finished his doctor's<br />\ndissertation at that institute. He is<br />\nnow in Hopkins on a scholarship<br />\nand is doing graduate work in<br />\neconomics under Dr. Hollander. Mr.<br />\nPodrabszky is able to read, write,<br />\nand speak French, German, and<br />\nEnglish, in addition to his native<br />\nlanguage, Hungarian, and can read<br />\nItalian, Latin, and Greek. In view<br />\nof his position among the university<br />\nstudents of his native land, he was<br />\nvery prominent in international student affairs and was represented in a<br />\nnumber of the International Confederation's gatherings congresses,<br />\nand committee meetings held in various parts of the Eutopean continent.<br />\nMr. Podrabsky furnished a<br />\ngreat deal of interesting information<br />\nconsidering the fundamental structure and arrangement of the Confederation. As has been stated, the<br />\ninternational body is made up of national bodies. In Hungary, the Students' Nationalist Body is organized<br />\nin a manner similar to the governments of several European nations.<br />\nThere are officers for social, interior, economics, administrative, and<br />\ncultural affairs, and, last but not<br />\nleast, foreign affairs. This specialization is beginning to spread into<br />\nmost of the countries of_ Europe, but<br />\nit has originally developed in the<br />\nHungarian Student Organization<br />\nwhich is usually accepted as a model. Mr. Podrabszky was head of the<br />\nforeign office of that organization.<br />\nAmong the aims of the International Confederation of Students<br />\nare:<br />\n1. To bring students of different<br />\nnationalities together in order to<br />\nmake them acquainted with ideas of<br />\ntheir respective countries and so<br />\nthat they may discuss problems of<br />\nthe present and future.<br />\n2. To train students for future<br />\nleadership.<br />\n3. To enable students to visit different countries by the holding of<br />\ncongresses and by travelling. (This<br />\nis made possible by the fact that the<br />\nnational organizations are able to<br />\nobtain living facilities for travelling<br />\nstudents, and transportation expenses are reduced 50 per cent.)<br />\n4. To provide for exchanges of<br />\nbooks between students of different<br />\ncountries.<br />\n5.

The necessity of relating a<br />\nsignificant event in a limited number<br />\nof words, occasioned by the amount<br />\nof space available in the paper and<br />\nthe costliness of telegraph and cable<br />\ntolls, makes it extremely difficult to<br />\nwrite the story so as to give exactly<br />\nthe proper impression of the happening. This difficulty is accentuated by the dependence of many<br />\nreaders upon the headlines, which<br />\naccordingly must attempt to express<br />\nthe meaning of a long story in less<br />\nthan forty words.<br />\nIn the course of the evening Mr.<br />\nJohnson asked Dr. French \"What<br />\nis education ?\" The librarian replied<br />\nthat he had recently and publicly<br />\nadmitted he hadn't the slightest<br />\nidea what it was. Mr. Johnson suggested that if a paper is to be an<br />\neducating force it must bring its<br />\nreaders the sort of news that will<br />\nbroaden their horizon and enable<br />\nthem to approach closer to the truth<br />\non the matters to which it pertains.<br />\nSince no paper can, for practical<br />\nconsiderations, print all the news it<br />\ngathers every day, it must assume<br />\nresponsibility for choosing the<br />\nstories it will use and the amount<br />\nand location of space it will give to<br />\nthem.<br />\nMr. Johnson said that the propagation of a definite doctrine, while<br />\nit may be educative, is not purely<br />\njournalistic, and that the introduction of a frankly educational purpose into its news columns is fatal<br />\nto a paper. Strict adherence to the<br />\noutward aspects of a situation is<br />\napt to carry a surprising amount of<br />\nits spirit and significance.
