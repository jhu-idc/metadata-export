But<br />\nthe lead, 12 to 11, was too slender<br />\nto maintain. Benzoin. Rutgers'<br />\n'star forward, came through with<br />\ntwo goals from the foul mark,<br />\nwhich ended Hopkins' period of<br />\nleadership. Throughout the game<br />\nthe Varsity contributed fouls when<br />\nRutgers was most needing them,<br />\nand Benzoin leaped on the opportunities like a cat and made the<br />\nmost of them.<br />\nThe first half was bitterly contested from whistle to whistle\u2014<br />\nfirst Rutgers then Hopkins in the<br />\nlead. Rutgers seemed to have<br />\nmore skill, but the Varsity was in<br />\nthe fighting with a power that<br />\ncould not be denied. Although<br />\nBenzoin was easily the Rutgers<br />\nstar, the Hopkins n-ten'fought as a<br />\nteam, and no particular star can<br />\nbe mentioned.<br />\nBut the second half was clearly<br />\nRutgers'.

Had they wished to save<br />\nthemselves for the clash with<br />\nNavy, it is not probable that they<br />\nwould have allowed Benzoin to<br />\ntake the roughing that he got.

He thus gives up his study<br />\nof medicine and -decides on an<br />\nArmy career after spending three<br />\nyears in pre-medical work.<br />\nThe tactics which Army is now<br />\nsaid to be employing to develop a<br />\nchampionship football team have<br />\naroused a,great amount of discussion and adverse criticism all over<br />\nthe country. The Military Academy, it would seem, has for the<br />\npast year been inaugurating a recruiting drive for the leading football stars of other colleges. The<br />\nmost important additions to the<br />\nArmy squad last season were<br />\nFrench and Storck, of Rutgers,<br />\nMullikin, of Columbia.<br />\nand<br />\nAmong those reported to have<br />\nbeen approached more recently<br />\n.by the recruiter are McMillan,<br />\ncenter; Flowers, Georgia Tech;<br />\nBoynton, Williams, Urban and<br />\nFitzpatrick, Boston College; Tarbish, W. & J; Lourie, graduating<br />\nfrom Princeton this year, and, of<br />\nparticular interest to Hopkins'<br />\nsupporters, Bill Wood, recently<br />\nelected to captain of this University's 1921 team.<br />\nWhen interviewed recently upon<br />\nthe subject of Army's tactics<br />\nCoach Van Orman, Hopkins athletic director, said that he could<br />\nnot be quoted too strongly as being<br />\nentirely opposed to West Point's<br />\nsystem of weaning football stars<br />\naway from the smaller colleges.<br />\nIn his opinion Army, on account<br />\nof its system of appointments,<br />\nwhich carry with them all living<br />\nexpenses and. a certain amount of<br />\nspending money, is able to \"get<br />\naway\" with methods which are<br />\nbound to hurt amateur athletics<br />\nand against which practically<br />\nevery college in the country is<br />\nfighting to bring about a higher<br />\nstandard of sportsmanship.<br />\nArmy's only excuse for its recruiting athletes is that athletes<br />\nmake better officers and are better<br />\nfitted to train enlisted men in<br />\ntheir various lines. If this is the<br />\ncase, then it is a question why the<br />\nWest Pointers have not approached college men who have<br />\nstarred in other branches of<br />\nsport. Of added, interest is the<br />\nfact that the Army people have<br />\n<br />\nBy shattering three records,<br />\nequaling another and performing<br />\nwell all around, the United States<br />\nNaval Academy swimmers were<br />\nable to swamp the Hopkins representatives in a dual meet last Saturday at Annapolis by a 51 to 11<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe meet opened with the 160yard relay, in which the future<br />\nadmirals finished with the splendid time of 1 minute 17% seconds,<br />\na second and three-fifths under the<br />\nformer mark. In the plunge, the<br />\ntwo Navy men had little difficulty<br />\nin defeating Hambleton, who,<br />\nnevertheless, showed much improvement over his work earlier in<br />\nthe season.

He<br />\nspent three and one-half years in<br />\nthe trenches, became British administrator of the city of Cologne<br />\nand was made a chevalier in the<br />\nLegion of Honor on account of<br />\nhis distinguished service.<br />\nMajor De Bles reviewed thoroughly and in a most interesting<br />\nmanner the causes which led to the<br />\noutbreak of war and then discussed the various movements of<br />\narmies and the most important<br />\nbattles from the beginning of the<br />\nGerman advance until the signing<br />\nof the armistice. Much information not generally known was<br />\ngiven, which was interspersed with<br />\nwitty remarks and humor, so characteristic of the typical Englishman.<br />\nHow brains won the war was<br />\nThe<br />\nthe gist of the lecture.<br />\nstrategical and tactical movements<br />\nof armies were explained in detail<br />\non maps made by the speaker. He<br />\nsaid that the French are the greatest strategists and cited Joffre,<br />\nwho used tactics at the battle of<br />\nNamur similar to those of Napoleon at Jena hundreds of years<br />\nago, as a typical example.<br />\nThe manner in which the German defeated himself by attempting to wage a successful war on<br />\ntwo fronts simultaneously was discussed. The transfer of troops<br />\nfrom the western to the eastern<br />\ntheater. of war weakened the lines<br />\nof defense and thus brought about<br />\nan earlier victory.<br />\nThe Boche had an inordinate<br />\ndelight in boasting about his<br />\nachievements, and for this very<br />\nreason the allied forces were able<br />\nto gain valuable information as to<br />\nthe number of men on the front,<br />\nthe reserves and losses. This was<br />\none mistake the Germans made.<br />\nAnother was a political mistake\u2014<br />\nwhen the treaty of Litovsk was<br />\ndrawn up the purpose of the German army on the western front<br />\nwas not concealed.

During<br />\nmaneuvers in France before the<br />\noutbreak of the war a German<br />\nmilitary attache, with offices in<br />\nParis, was injured; upon his recovery he was given the medal of<br />\nthe Legion of Honor. The war<br />\nbroke out shortly after and he<br />\nwent back to Germany. When the<br />\ncommissioners from the German<br />\narmy appeared before General<br />\nFoci to receive the terms of armistice this man came in wearing the<br />\nmedal which had been awarded<br />\nhim. General Foch said \"I authorize you to remove that medal,\"<br />\nand he did.<br />\nIn closing he added that above<br />\nall the intellectual lessons of the<br />\nwar must not be forgotten, that<br />\nin life as well as in war a battle<br />\nwon is one which yau know you<br />\ncan win, and all that is needed is<br />\na strong will and determination.<br />\nThis lecture was by far the most<br />\ninteresting given so far, as was<br />\nevidenced by the applause of the<br />\nstudent-body and their demand<br />\nthat the speaker continue although<br />\nthe period was long up.

But<br />\nthe lead, 12 to 11, was too slender<br />\nto maintain. Benzoin. Rutgers'<br />\n'star forward, came through with<br />\ntwo goals from the foul mark,<br />\nwhich ended Hopkins' period of<br />\nleadership. Throughout the game<br />\nthe Varsity contributed fouls when<br />\nRutgers was most needing them,<br />\nand Benzoin leaped on the opportunities like a cat and made the<br />\nmost of them.<br />\nThe first half was bitterly contested from whistle to whistle\u2014<br />\nfirst Rutgers then Hopkins in the<br />\nlead. Rutgers seemed to have<br />\nmore skill, but the Varsity was in<br />\nthe fighting with a power that<br />\ncould not be denied. Although<br />\nBenzoin was easily the Rutgers<br />\nstar, the Hopkins n-ten'fought as a<br />\nteam, and no particular star can<br />\nbe mentioned.<br />\nBut the second half was clearly<br />\nRutgers'. Benzoin seemed a whilwind that Hopkins could not stop.<br />\nWhen the Black and Blue covered<br />\nthe sacred region near their goal,<br />\nhe dodged and side-stepped after<br />\n\u2022 the most approved big-league manner, and often forced an opening<br />\nfor a score. Rutgers scored 10<br />\nPoints to 11 for Hopkins in this<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe idea that Rutgers was play.inir around with Hopkins is childish. Had they wished to save<br />\nthemselves for the clash with<br />\nNavy, it is not probable that they<br />\nwould have allowed Benzoin to<br />\ntake the roughing that he got.

He thus gives up his study<br />\nof medicine and -decides on an<br />\nArmy career after spending three<br />\nyears in pre-medical work.<br />\nThe tactics which Army is now<br />\nsaid to be employing to develop a<br />\nchampionship football team have<br />\naroused a,great amount of discussion and adverse criticism all over<br />\nthe country. The Military Academy, it would seem, has for the<br />\npast year been inaugurating a recruiting drive for the leading football stars of other colleges. The<br />\nmost important additions to the<br />\nArmy squad last season were<br />\nFrench and Storck, of Rutgers,<br />\nMullikin, of Columbia.<br />\nand<br />\nAmong those reported to have<br />\nbeen approached more recently<br />\n.by the recruiter are McMillan,<br />\ncenter; Flowers, Georgia Tech;<br />\nBoynton, Williams, Urban and<br />\nFitzpatrick, Boston College; Tarbish, W. &amp; J; Lourie, graduating<br />\nfrom Princeton this year, and, of<br />\nparticular interest to Hopkins'<br />\nsupporters, Bill Wood, recently<br />\nelected to captain of this University's 1921 team.<br />\nWhen interviewed recently upon<br />\nthe subject of Army's tactics<br />\nCoach Van Orman, Hopkins athletic director, said that he could<br />\nnot be quoted too strongly as being<br />\nentirely opposed to West Point's<br />\nsystem of weaning football stars<br />\naway from the smaller colleges.<br />\nIn his opinion Army, on account<br />\nof its system of appointments,<br />\nwhich carry with them all living<br />\nexpenses and. a certain amount of<br />\nspending money, is able to \"get<br />\naway\" with methods which are<br />\nbound to hurt amateur athletics<br />\nand against which practically<br />\nevery college in the country is<br />\nfighting to bring about a higher<br />\nstandard of sportsmanship.<br />\nArmy's only excuse for its recruiting athletes is that athletes<br />\nmake better officers and are better<br />\nfitted to train enlisted men in<br />\ntheir various lines. If this is the<br />\ncase, then it is a question why the<br />\nWest Pointers have not approached college men who have<br />\nstarred in other branches of<br />\nsport. Of added, interest is the<br />\nfact that the Army people have<br /><br />\nBy shattering three records,<br />\nequaling another and performing<br />\nwell all around, the United States<br />\nNaval Academy swimmers were<br />\nable to swamp the Hopkins representatives in a dual meet last Saturday at Annapolis by a 51 to 11<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe meet opened with the 160yard relay, in which the future<br />\nadmirals finished with the splendid time of 1 minute 17% seconds,<br />\na second and three-fifths under the<br />\nformer mark. In the plunge, the<br />\ntwo Navy men had little difficulty<br />\nin defeating Hambleton, who,<br />\nnevertheless, showed much improvement over his work earlier in<br />\nthe season. Emory of the Academy, equaled the record of 19 seconds in the 40-yard dash, Gallagher, his team-mate, and Rowland,<br />\nHopkins' captain, following in<br />\norder.<br />\nThe 40-yard back-stroke<br />\nevent furnished the thrill of the<br />\ncontest, McIntosh of Navy nosing<br />\nout.Reins and Hall of Hopkins by<br />\nbut few feet.

He was<br />\nfollowed by Fish and Coady of<br />\nNavy and Hopkins, respectively.<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\nSOPHS PLAN TO GIVE PROM<br /><br />\nThe chief business of the Sophomore class, called by 0.

This was<br />\none mistake the Germans made.<br />\nAnother was a political mistake\u2014<br />\nwhen the treaty of Litovsk was<br />\ndrawn up the purpose of the German army on the western front<br />\nwas not concealed.

The<br />\nadvance through the Argonne<br />\nfinally led to the presenting of the<br />\narmistice terms which Germany<br />\naccepted and hostilities ended.<br />\nMajor De Bles gave an example<br />\nof German psychology. During<br />\nmaneuvers in France before the<br />\noutbreak of the war a German<br />\nmilitary attache, with offices in<br />\nParis, was injured; upon his recovery he was given the medal of<br />\nthe Legion of Honor. The war<br />\nbroke out shortly after and he<br />\nwent back to Germany. When the<br />\ncommissioners from the German<br />\narmy appeared before General<br />\nFoci to receive the terms of armistice this man came in wearing the<br />\nmedal which had been awarded<br />\nhim.
