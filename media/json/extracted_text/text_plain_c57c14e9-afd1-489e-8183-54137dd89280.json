Brown,<br />\nthe Washington College pitcher,<br />\npitched a remarkable game \u2022 after<br />\nthe first inning, holding the Black<br />\nand Blue team to a single hit.<br />\nThe game opened disastrously<br />\nfor Hopkins. Wallace won a base<br />\nwhich he did not deserve, and<br />\nFrampton was allowed to turn an<br />\nattempted sacrifice into an actual<br />\nbase. Wallace scored on a sacrifice fly by Spedden. Errickson<br />\ndoubled to center, and W.Wallace<br />\nachieved a homer, bringing in<br />\nthree runs.<br />\nThe inauspicious start, however,<br />\nseemed to bring the requisite<br />\namount of fighting blood to the<br />\nHopkins team. Porter was hit<br />\nby a pitched ball, immediately<br />\nstole second, and was advanced<br />\nto third by WOrthington's single.<br />\nNoble sent a single through center, bringing in two runs. Hobbs<br />\nwas given a base on balls. Loose<br />\nplaying on the part of the visitors<br />\nallowed Noble to score and Egerton to reach first. Benson hit<br />\nto Spedden, and was out at<br />\nfirst. Levin was given a base on<br />\nballs; he was followed by Howell,<br />\nwho sent a single to left. Wasserman fanned. Errickson muffed<br />\nPorter's fly, allowing Howell to<br />\nscore. Worthington made the<br />\nthird out.<br />\nIn the ninth,'Washington College began a rally, which, for a<br />\ntime, threatened defeat to the<br />\nBlack and Blue. Two runs were<br />\nscored.

It was decided, moreover, that the change in schedule be<br />\nbegun immediately after the Easter vacation.<br />\nAt the same time, it was unanimously agreed that the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty should recommend to the Board of Trustees that the three<br />\nmen in the academic department\u2014William Skinner, Robert Merrick<br />\nand Howard Wilson\u2014who have expressed a desire to take examinations for commissions in the United States Army, should be immediately examined upon the term's work so far, and, if they pass, should<br />\nbe given their degrees without further delay. While official action can<br />\nonly come from the Board of Trustees; there is not the slightest doubt<br />\nbut that the recommendation of the faculty will be granted. Nor is there<br />\nany doubt as to the fact that the same privilege will be accorded to<br />\nall other 'Seniors who wish to join the colors.<br />\nThe object in introducing the<br />\nchange in schedule immediately is<br />\ntwo-fold. In the first place, the<br />\nearlier schedule is to be treated<br />\nsomewhat as an experiment. If<br />\nit proves successful in the few<br />\nremaining months of this collegiate year it will be adopted in full<br />\nbefore the opening of the University next fall, when daylight practice will be most needed. Members of the faculty make no secret<br />\nof the fact that the success of the<br />\nexperiment depends upon the way<br />\nin which it is accepted by the<br />\nstudent body. If the number of<br />\nlatenesses shows any marked increase, the entire scheme may fail.<br />\nIn the second place, earlier<br />\nclasses for the remainder of the<br />\nyear will prove of material advantage in the development of the<br />\nHopkins Reserve Officers' Training Corps. The drills may now<br />\nnot only continue earlier, but, due<br />\nto the increasing length of the<br />\ndays, may also last longer.<br />\nThe faculty took another action<br />\ndesigned to promote the training<br />\nof Hopkins students in deciding<br />\nthat for the reaminder of the year<br />\nmembers of the battalion will be<br />\nexcused from classes every Wednesday. Lieutenant Elliott plans<br />\nto put the corps through drills<br />\nand maneuvers throughout the<br />\nwhole of this day.<br />\nThe actions of the faculty are<br />\nregarded as\u2022 particularly significant, as showing the extent to<br />\nwhich the University stands ready<br />\nto co operate with ;the Government. It is rumored that the<br />\nsteps taken on Saturday, unprecedented as they are in Hopkins'<br />\nhistory, will be but the first if<br />\nPresident Wilson calls upon the<br />\ncountry to prepare itself for actual hostilities.<br />\n<br />\nWhile at the present time, with<br />\nPresident Wilson's address to<br />\nCongress still undelivered, it is<br />\nimpossible to say just what Wilt<br />\nhappen, even in the course of the<br />\ncoming week, there seems to be no<br />\nidea of closing the University before the scheduled date. When<br />\ninterviewed upon the subject,<br />\nDean Brush gave it as his opinion<br />\nthat, as matters now stand,<br />\nnothing could be gained by such a<br />\ncourse. Every opportunity will<br />\nbe allowed for Hopkins students<br />\nto serve their country in whatever<br />\nway they choose, but, unless the<br />\nnumber of those who wish to take<br />\nthe examinations for commissions<br />\nor to volunteer as privates comes<br />\nto include the majority of the attendants upon the. University,<br />\nclasses will continue until June.<br />\nDean Brush pointed out that a<br />\nvery practical way of preparing<br />\nto serve their country is already<br />\nopen to Hopkins men in the Hopkins Reserve Officers' Training<br />\nCorps. While not desirous of influencing the course of the men<br />\nwho wanted to enlist, he said<br />\nthat, in his opinion, they might<br />\nserve their country most, efficiently, unless, indeed, previous<br />\ntraining fitted them for some detailed service, by learning how to<br />\nbecome officers. \u2022<br />\nAs sufficiently indicated by the<br />\nmeasures taken last Saturday,<br />\nthe corps is to be supported in<br />\nevery way possible. Both the<br />\nfaculty and the board of trustees<br />\nare ready to collaborate with<br />\nLieut Elliott in all that he deems<br />\nnecessary for the battalion's final<br />\ndevelopment. Should war be declared,. it is highly probable that<br />\nspecial arrangements will be made<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nALUMNI CO DOWN TO DEFEAT<br />\n'Varsity Scores 10 Goals to Veterans' 3.<br />\nShows an Unusually Strong Attack.<br />\nWhole Team Well Developed.<br />\nOutdoor Practice Tells.<br />\n<br />\nThe 'Varsity lacrosse team<br />\nopened its season auspiciously<br />\nlast Saturday afternoon by defeating the Alumni, 10 to 3. Despite<br />\nthe apparent one-sidedness of the<br />\nscore the game was interesting,<br />\nfor the veterans were full of fight<br />\nand kept the 'Varsity busy all the<br />\ntime. Had they had the speed<br />\nand wind to match their knowledge of the game, they would have<br />\ngiven the younger men a much<br />\ncloser battle.<br />\nHenry Frank, especially, gave<br />\nseveral pretty exhibitions of \"how<br />\nthey did it in the old days.\" Prevost Boyce and Alan Voshell, two<br />\nOf the stars of last year's team,<br />\nhad been working out with the<br />\nmen all winter, and kept the 'Varsity defense continually on the<br />\njumpThe Alumni were handicapped<br />\nby the loss of Tommy Troxell,<br />\ntheir captain, who was able to<br />\nplay only a few moments on account of an injury to his knee<br />\nwhich he sustained in practice<br />\nlast week.<br />\nThe most pleasing feature of<br />\nthe 'Varsity's playing was their<br />\nsplendid teamwork and knowledge<br />\nof the game, especially for so<br />\nearly in the season. This is due<br />\nnot only to the fact that most of<br />\nthe men have played together before, but also because of the large<br />\namount of hard outdoor work<br />\nmade possible by the early arrival<br />\nof spring.<br />\nThe Cornell game this Saturday<br />\nwill be one of the hardest on the \u2022<br />\nschedule. The Big Red team, who<br />\nwere the champions of the Northern division of the league last<br />\nyear, have almost all of their men<br />\nback, and have prospects for an<br />\nunusually strong team.<br />\nThe 'Varsity midfield attack<br />\nworked especially well last Saturday. The men got the ball shortly<br />\nafter the whistle was sounded,<br />\nand goals were caged by Hoffman,<br />\nWolfe and Johnny Knipp within<br />\na very few minutes. After that,<br />\nthe Alumni settled down, and the<br />\n'Varsity were able to score only<br />\none more goal during the half.<br />\nAt the beginning of the second<br />\nperiod Henry Frank slipped the<br />\nfirst one by Hank Chalmers, who<br />\nput up a splendid game at goal<br />\nthroughout the contest. In a few<br />\nminutes the 'Varsity steadied,<br />\nand started scoring again. Pretty<br />\nmidfield work by the Suttons<br />\nworked the ball up toward the<br />\nposts, where several shots were<br />\nscored by the Knipp brothers<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, APRIL 2, 1.917.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\naij Besides, the reputation of an old-established firm is<br />\nback of each sale with a guarantee.<br />\n<br />\nJohn C.

He first compared the European and the<br />\nAmerican university and showed<br />\nhow different was the influence of<br />\nthe university on society in this<br />\ncountry and abroad. There the<br />\nstudents are the leaders in all<br />\nradical reforms, and the generators of new thoughts and ideas.<br />\nIn contrast, the American student while more attractive in personality is, nevertheless, not as<br />\nwell developed along many lines.<br />\nAmerican universities, Dr. Slonimsky said, were becoming professional schools for the grinding<br />\nout of engineers, doctors, lawyers,<br />\netc., without teaching them anything of the cultural, classic side.<br />\nThe universities in this century<br />\nshould become the breeding places<br />\nfor ideas and the instruments for<br />\nspreading the humanities.<br />\nAnother prominent speaker was<br />\nRussell Murphy, or \"Murph,\" next<br />\nyear's football coach and athletic<br />\nadvisor. He unfolded, in part,<br />\nthe plan that he hopes to inaugurate next fall. He intends to look<br />\nto the future, to try to get as<br />\nmany students as possible in the<br />\nhabit of taking regular exercise,<br />\nand inducing them to continue<br />\nthis after they leave college, thus<br />\ngradually tending to build up the<br />\nphysical side of the men of this<br />\ncountry.<br />\nRobert Duncan also spoke, taking for his subject the \"Glory of<br />\nthe Class.\" He spoke of \"Bob\"<br />\nLayfleld and urged every member<br />\nof the class to follow their former<br />\nfriend and classmate as an ideal.<br />\n\"Hank\" Chalmers was the next<br />\nspeaker, using \"Class Spirit\" as<br />\nhis theme. \"Lefty\" Taylor recited, with an appropriate introduction, his original poem on the<br />\n\"Descent of Man.\" This amusing<br />\npiece presented Darwin's theories<br />\nin a striking way.

They will always remember<br />\nthe sacrifice which he made for his<br />\nUniversity; always to them he<br />\nwill stand for the personification<br />\nof courage and loyalty. For those<br />\nmen, Layfield needs no monument; his name is writ upon their<br />\nhearts in letters more enduring<br />\nthan bronze.<br />\nYet, for the generations of Hopkins students who know the story<br />\nof Layfield only as it has been<br />\ntold to them, it is eminently fitting that his memory and the<br />\nthings for which he stood should<br />\nbe perpetuated in a tangible form.<br />\nSoon there will come the time<br />\nwhen not a student in the University has heard of Layfield but by<br />\nhearsay, when the knowledge that<br />\na man once gave his life for Hopkins will become a knowledge impersonal \u2014 a knowledge . only<br />\nvaguely present in University consciousness. It was to keep that<br />\nknowledge before the eyes of future classes that the idea of the<br />\nmemorial was conceived and carried out.<br />\nIt is not the bare fact that Layfield sacrificed his life for his University that is so meaningful; it<br />\nwas in the way in which he<br />\nmet his death that the nobility of<br />\nthe man shone forth so clearly.<br />\nFor weeks he lay upon his bed,<br />\nparalyzed, his body encased in<br />\nplaster. Yet, until the very end,<br />\nhe refused to surrender hope; with<br />\nthe same unquenchable courage<br />\nthat he had shown upon the football field, he fought long after his<br />\ndoctors had given up the battle\u2014<br />\na fight filled with an anguish that<br />\n<br />\nEvidence.<br />\n<br />\nA few weeks ago President<br />\nGoodnow officially announced that<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nstood prepared to serve the Government in whatever way it was<br />\nmost fitted. The action taken by<br />\nthe faculty last Saturday proved<br />\nconclusively that it was ready to<br />\nmake that promise good, and to<br />\nmake it good up to the hilt. In<br />\nthemselves, the beginning of University classes at 8.30, the immediate granting of degrees to Seniors who wish to enlist and the<br />\nexcusing of the members of the<br />\ncorps from classes for an entire<br />\nday, are unprecedented enough<br />\nin University history, yet these<br />\nthings are but the beginning\u2014<br />\nsteps taken before war has been<br />\ndeclared. There can be no possible doubt that if Hopkins does<br />\nnot close before its scheduled<br />\ntime, it will be only because of<br />\nthe fact that the University can<br />\nserve the Government more efficiently by remaining open.<br />\nThere was, however, a step<br />\ntaken by the faculty last Saturday which, in its implications,<br />\nwas even more significant than<br />\nthe steps taken in regard to University matters. The letter dispatched to President Wilson by<br />\nsixty-three members of the faculty<br />\nis far more than the expression<br />\nof the opinions of sixty-three individuals. The signers of that<br />\nletter represent one of the most<br />\nintellectual group of men in the<br />\nworld\u2014the fact that they have<br />\ngone on record as in favor both<br />\nof war with Germany and of universal military training has a far<br />\ngreater meaning than the mere<br />\nnumber of the men who affixed<br />\ntheir signatures to the plea would<br />\nin itself imply.<br />\nObviously, the Hopkins undergraduate body has not the weight<br />\nin matters of national import that<br />\nwould be accorded to the Hopkins faculty, but THE NEWS-LETTER believes that a canvass of the<br />\nstudents at the present time<br />\nwould show in most conclusive<br />\nfashion that the opinions of Hopkins students coincide very remarkably with the opinions of<br />\nHopkins professors.<br />\n<br />\nThe Season Opens.<br />\n<br />\nThere is something peculiarly<br />\nthrilling in the sight which Homewood Field presents on a spring<br />\nSaturday afternoon. The splatter<br />\nof colors on the grandstands, the<br />\nblack fringe surrounding the oval,<br />\nthe smooth expanse of green turf,<br />\nthe murmur of many voices, the<br />\ncheers,the tense silence that comes<br />\nover the stands when the attack<br />\nis close upon the goal\u2014surely,this<br />\nis not one of the most unpicturesque phases of college life.<br />\n-The game of lacrosse, too, which<br />\nHopkins has made so distinctively<br />\nits own\u2014no form of athletics, perhaps, is more breath-checking in<br />\nits intensity, and yet, more open<br />\nin its style of play. Other universities have failed as yet to realize<br />\nthe beauty of the game\u2014have kept<br />\nit as one of their minor sports;<br />\nHopkins men have known for<br />\ngenerations that there can be no<br />\nthrill greater than the thrill which<br />\ncomes when stick clashes with<br />\nstick, when lithe bodies dart down<br />\nthe field, passing the ball between<br />\nthem, when the quick swing and<br />\nthe rocking tell that the attack<br />\nhas been intercepted. There is an<br />\nexhilaration to the game, played<br />\nas Hopkins men play it, which no<br />\nother sport can surpass\u2014the keen<br />\nappreciation the grandstands experience in watching the perfect<br />\nco-ordination of mind and muscle<br />\nis as undiluted a tribute to beauty<br />\nas ever Greek paid to Doric<br />\ntemple.<br />\nSome there are who hold that<br />\nthe activities of a college should<br />\nbe restricted to lines strictly academic, who regard the enthusiasm<br />\nengendered over the success of<br />\ncollege teams as enthusiasm misplaced, and the energy consumed<br />\nin the development of those teams<br />\nas energy wasted. To such onlookers life must seem a drab and<br />\n,colorless thing, iron-bound with<br />\nduties, lacking all buoyancy and<br />\ngladness.

The<br />\nonly point is whether the men in<br />\nthe class, in future years, would<br />\nbe more liable to pay the money to<br />\nthe University directly than, to<br />\npay the premiums on a policy<br />\nwhich, they would know, could<br />\nnever bear full results if the payments were discontinued. If the<br />\npayments would be made directly<br />\nto the University there would, of<br />\ncourse, be a separate account created into which each. yearly deposit would be paid and whichi<br />\ncould not be drawn upon by theUniversity until the time set by<br />\nthe class had elapsed.<br />\nThere are also many other considerations involved, and, as a result, at a meeting last Friday in<br />\nthe Mechanical Engineering Building the class instructed its committee to make a thorough investigation of the various plans.

The object of an<br />\nathletic policy is certainly not<br />\nmere winning of games, as so<br />\nmany assume, but is the physical<br />\ndevelopment of the college student. We should be glad on this<br />\nscore that we have none of those<br />\n\"athletic scholarships\" so common<br />\nin most universities where the<br />\nathletic policy wins games. The<br />\nwhole system however, tends to<br />\nthose who have dedevelop only'<br />\ncided athletic ability, leaving to<br />\nthe rest the opportunity for exercise only on the rooting stands.<br />\nHopkins suffers from this less,<br />\nperhaps, than other colleges, but<br />\nwe are now at a point of change<br />\nand must prepare for the eventuality of a larger student-body. A<br />\nuniversity is not an athletic training camp which should specialize<br />\non those who have athletic talents.<br />\nIt is a place of intellectual specialization and should see that<br />\nsound bodies are provided for<br />\ngood minds\u2014not following the ordinary fallacy of trying to improve the mind by making a<br />\nstrong body stronger.<br />\nThe tendency in athletic matters should be to lay more and<br />\nmore emphasis upon interclass<br />\ncontests and away from 'varsity<br />\nsports. Interclass athletics avoids<br />\nany danger of professionalization<br />\nand attracts far greater numbers.<br />\nIt may be urged that one could<br />\nnot get up as much enthusiasm<br />\nabout interclass contests as interuniversity ones. There is really<br />\nno reason why this should be. Objectively considered there is just<br />\nas much to be enthusiastic about<br />\nin both.<br />\nThis brings me to a criticism<br />\ndirected more against the studentbody as a whole than against the<br />\nathletic policy. We realize how<br />\nfoolish it would be to become excited about interclass contests,<br />\nand yet we yell ourselves hoarse<br />\nabout some football game. Is it<br />\nnot a disgrace that we can work<br />\nourselves into such a frenzy as to<br />\nbelieve that the winning of a<br />\ngame deserves a parade while we<br />\ntake no notice whatsoever of the<br />\n<br />\nRussian revolution, the most glorious event of a century?<br />\nThere is, of course, no institution at our college that is perfect,<br />\nand it would be both hopeless and<br />\nfoolish for me to attempt to criticise them all. Yet I feel that<br />\nthere are many things about the<br />\nmore important institutions which<br />\nhad better be said. Since I am<br />\napproaching these matters in a<br />\nthoughtful -and objective manner,<br />\nI ask that those of my fellow-students who read these letters will<br />\nmeet me half way with corresponding lack of passion and<br />\nprejudice.<br />\nAs an agency for \"social welfare\" the Y. M. C. A. at college is<br />\nundoubtedly excellent. For its<br />\nintention to combat against the<br />\nskepticism and agnosticism that<br />\nso often comes with college education it deserves the highest<br />\npraise. Yet, when we consider it<br />\napart from its intention, we must<br />\nregretfully recognize that it is one<br />\nof the strong forces against the<br />\nprogressive thought and intellectuality of our life. One might<br />\nexpect that the Y. M. C. A. would<br />\ninculcate in its members the<br />\ngreat ideals of humanity\u2014charity,<br />\ntolerance; yet it is among the<br />\nmembers of this organization that<br />\none finds the most intense and<br />\nfanatical intolerance. Whether<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A. encourages the<br />\ngrowth of these prejudices or not,<br />\ntheir continued existence bears<br />\ntestimony to a signal failure in<br />\nwhat should be its highest purpose.<br />\nI am at a loss to explain this<br />\nfailure unless the reason is to be<br />\nfound in the frantic efforts of the<br />\nY. M. C. A. in the face of the<br />\ngreat forces of skepticism to preserve anything, so that in the fear<br />\nof thinking too fast it refuses to<br />\nthink at all, and in attempting to<br />\nkeep the faith, it preserves also<br />\nthe prejudices and childishness of<br />\nthe Sunday-school.<br />\nDuring the last year the Menorah Society has attained quite<br />\nsome prominence as a part of the<br />\ncollege life of our Hebrew fellowstudents. It seems to me that<br />\nthis organization, by segregating<br />\nthat part of our student-body,<br />\nhelps to preserve racial prejudices<br />\nin much the same way that the<br />\nfraternities help to preserve class<br />\nprejudice. In European universities and in most of our American institutions the Hebrews are<br />\namong the most active forces for<br />\nthought and progress. This function they should exercise also at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt may be poor etiquette for me<br />\nto criticise my host, yet I must<br />\nsay that THE NEWS-LETTER is<br />\npetty\u2014not the sort of periodical<br />\none should expect at a great university. Outside of ,its editorials,<br />\nwhich are usually very good, it is<br />\ncomposed of stale news, trivial<br />\nnews\u2014news that everyone already<br />\nknows, or news that no one wants<br />\nto know.

An officer of the local naval recruiting<br />\nstation described the work of the<br />\n\"mosquito fleet\" and its inducements, and took the names of<br />\nthose who manifested interest.<br />\nThe Hopkins unit, if formed,<br />\nwould be a part of the Fifth<br />\nNaval District, which comprises<br />\nMaryland, Delaware, the District<br />\nof Columbia, Virginia, North<br />\nCarolina and South Carolina.<br />\nIts particular work would consist largely in patrolling the<br />\nChesapeake Bay and surrounding<br />\nwaters. Probably two or three<br />\nboats would be manned by this<br />\nunit, which would serve as harbor, mine or coast patrols, cooperate with United States submarines and aircraft, act as despatch boats and pursue hostile.<br />\nsubmarines.<br />\nIn size, the boats, probably<br />\neither yachts or motor powerboats, would range from forty to<br />\none hundred and ten feet long,<br />\nand the crews would vary from<br />\nfive to ten men. Each boat would<br />\nbe manned by an experienced ensign, several Hopkins students as<br />\npetty officers, a gunner's mate, a<br />\nboatswain and a few experienced<br />\nseamen.<br />\nThe recruiting officer remarked<br />\n'that each of the Hopkins contingent would have a good chance<br />\nto be chief petty officers. He also<br />\nquoted a navy man as saying that<br />\nif a college man is given fifteen<br />\nminutes' instruction he May make<br />\na better sailor than one who has<br />\nserved before the mast for fifteen<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe members of the unit would<br />\nenroll in the Naval Coast Defense<br />\nReserve for four years, but could<br />\nonly be called out in case of actual war or emergency. Moreover,<br />\nthey could not be transported to<br />\nanother district or to another<br />\nbranch of the naval service without their own sanction. Should<br />\nthe unit be established, its prospective members, after enrollment<br />\nat the recruiting office, would<br />\nbe given ten days' training under<br />\nthe direction of the commandant<br />\nof the Fifth Naval District. In<br />\naddition, they could enter three<br />\nmonths' actual service of their<br />\nown volition.

Brown,<br />\nthe Washington College pitcher,<br />\npitched a remarkable game \u2022 after<br />\nthe first inning, holding the Black<br />\nand Blue team to a single hit.<br />\nThe game opened disastrously<br />\nfor Hopkins. Wallace won a base<br />\nwhich he did not deserve, and<br />\nFrampton was allowed to turn an<br />\nattempted sacrifice into an actual<br />\nbase. Wallace scored on a sacrifice fly by Spedden. Errickson<br />\ndoubled to center, and W.Wallace<br />\nachieved a homer, bringing in<br />\nthree runs.<br />\nThe inauspicious start, however,<br />\nseemed to bring the requisite<br />\namount of fighting blood to the<br />\nHopkins team. Porter was hit<br />\nby a pitched ball, immediately<br />\nstole second, and was advanced<br />\nto third by WOrthington's single.<br />\nNoble sent a single through center, bringing in two runs. Hobbs<br />\nwas given a base on balls. Loose<br />\nplaying on the part of the visitors<br />\nallowed Noble to score and Egerton to reach first. Benson hit<br />\nto Spedden, and was out at<br />\nfirst. Levin was given a base on<br />\nballs; he was followed by Howell,<br />\nwho sent a single to left. Wasserman fanned. Errickson muffed<br />\nPorter's fly, allowing Howell to<br />\nscore. Worthington made the<br />\nthird out.<br />\nIn the ninth,'Washington College began a rally, which, for a<br />\ntime, threatened defeat to the<br />\nBlack and Blue. Two runs were<br />\nscored.

It was decided, moreover, that the change in schedule be<br />\nbegun immediately after the Easter vacation.<br />\nAt the same time, it was unanimously agreed that the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty should recommend to the Board of Trustees that the three<br />\nmen in the academic department\u2014William Skinner, Robert Merrick<br />\nand Howard Wilson\u2014who have expressed a desire to take examinations for commissions in the United States Army, should be immediately examined upon the term's work so far, and, if they pass, should<br />\nbe given their degrees without further delay. While official action can<br />\nonly come from the Board of Trustees; there is not the slightest doubt<br />\nbut that the recommendation of the faculty will be granted. Nor is there<br />\nany doubt as to the fact that the same privilege will be accorded to<br />\nall other 'Seniors who wish to join the colors.<br />\nThe object in introducing the<br />\nchange in schedule immediately is<br />\ntwo-fold. In the first place, the<br />\nearlier schedule is to be treated<br />\nsomewhat as an experiment. If<br />\nit proves successful in the few<br />\nremaining months of this collegiate year it will be adopted in full<br />\nbefore the opening of the University next fall, when daylight practice will be most needed. Members of the faculty make no secret<br />\nof the fact that the success of the<br />\nexperiment depends upon the way<br />\nin which it is accepted by the<br />\nstudent body. If the number of<br />\nlatenesses shows any marked increase, the entire scheme may fail.<br />\nIn the second place, earlier<br />\nclasses for the remainder of the<br />\nyear will prove of material advantage in the development of the<br />\nHopkins Reserve Officers' Training Corps. The drills may now<br />\nnot only continue earlier, but, due<br />\nto the increasing length of the<br />\ndays, may also last longer.<br />\nThe faculty took another action<br />\ndesigned to promote the training<br />\nof Hopkins students in deciding<br />\nthat for the reaminder of the year<br />\nmembers of the battalion will be<br />\nexcused from classes every Wednesday. Lieutenant Elliott plans<br />\nto put the corps through drills<br />\nand maneuvers throughout the<br />\nwhole of this day.<br />\nThe actions of the faculty are<br />\nregarded as\u2022 particularly significant, as showing the extent to<br />\nwhich the University stands ready<br />\nto co operate with ;the Government. It is rumored that the<br />\nsteps taken on Saturday, unprecedented as they are in Hopkins'<br />\nhistory, will be but the first if<br />\nPresident Wilson calls upon the<br />\ncountry to prepare itself for actual hostilities.<br /><br />\nWhile at the present time, with<br />\nPresident Wilson's address to<br />\nCongress still undelivered, it is<br />\nimpossible to say just what Wilt<br />\nhappen, even in the course of the<br />\ncoming week, there seems to be no<br />\nidea of closing the University before the scheduled date. When<br />\ninterviewed upon the subject,<br />\nDean Brush gave it as his opinion<br />\nthat, as matters now stand,<br />\nnothing could be gained by such a<br />\ncourse. Every opportunity will<br />\nbe allowed for Hopkins students<br />\nto serve their country in whatever<br />\nway they choose, but, unless the<br />\nnumber of those who wish to take<br />\nthe examinations for commissions<br />\nor to volunteer as privates comes<br />\nto include the majority of the attendants upon the. University,<br />\nclasses will continue until June.<br />\nDean Brush pointed out that a<br />\nvery practical way of preparing<br />\nto serve their country is already<br />\nopen to Hopkins men in the Hopkins Reserve Officers' Training<br />\nCorps. While not desirous of influencing the course of the men<br />\nwho wanted to enlist, he said<br />\nthat, in his opinion, they might<br />\nserve their country most, efficiently, unless, indeed, previous<br />\ntraining fitted them for some detailed service, by learning how to<br />\nbecome officers. \u2022<br />\nAs sufficiently indicated by the<br />\nmeasures taken last Saturday,<br />\nthe corps is to be supported in<br />\nevery way possible. Both the<br />\nfaculty and the board of trustees<br />\nare ready to collaborate with<br />\nLieut Elliott in all that he deems<br />\nnecessary for the battalion's final<br />\ndevelopment. Should war be declared,. it is highly probable that<br />\nspecial arrangements will be made<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 3)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nALUMNI CO DOWN TO DEFEAT<br />\n'Varsity Scores 10 Goals to Veterans' 3.<br />\nShows an Unusually Strong Attack.<br />\nWhole Team Well Developed.<br />\nOutdoor Practice Tells.<br /><br />\nThe 'Varsity lacrosse team<br />\nopened its season auspiciously<br />\nlast Saturday afternoon by defeating the Alumni, 10 to 3. Despite<br />\nthe apparent one-sidedness of the<br />\nscore the game was interesting,<br />\nfor the veterans were full of fight<br />\nand kept the 'Varsity busy all the<br />\ntime. Had they had the speed<br />\nand wind to match their knowledge of the game, they would have<br />\ngiven the younger men a much<br />\ncloser battle.<br />\nHenry Frank, especially, gave<br />\nseveral pretty exhibitions of \"how<br />\nthey did it in the old days.\" Prevost Boyce and Alan Voshell, two<br />\nOf the stars of last year's team,<br />\nhad been working out with the<br />\nmen all winter, and kept the 'Varsity defense continually on the<br />\njumpThe Alumni were handicapped<br />\nby the loss of Tommy Troxell,<br />\ntheir captain, who was able to<br />\nplay only a few moments on account of an injury to his knee<br />\nwhich he sustained in practice<br />\nlast week.<br />\nThe most pleasing feature of<br />\nthe 'Varsity's playing was their<br />\nsplendid teamwork and knowledge<br />\nof the game, especially for so<br />\nearly in the season. This is due<br />\nnot only to the fact that most of<br />\nthe men have played together before, but also because of the large<br />\namount of hard outdoor work<br />\nmade possible by the early arrival<br />\nof spring.<br />\nThe Cornell game this Saturday<br />\nwill be one of the hardest on the \u2022<br />\nschedule. The Big Red team, who<br />\nwere the champions of the Northern division of the league last<br />\nyear, have almost all of their men<br />\nback, and have prospects for an<br />\nunusually strong team.<br />\nThe 'Varsity midfield attack<br />\nworked especially well last Saturday. The men got the ball shortly<br />\nafter the whistle was sounded,<br />\nand goals were caged by Hoffman,<br />\nWolfe and Johnny Knipp within<br />\na very few minutes. After that,<br />\nthe Alumni settled down, and the<br />\n'Varsity were able to score only<br />\none more goal during the half.<br />\nAt the beginning of the second<br />\nperiod Henry Frank slipped the<br />\nfirst one by Hank Chalmers, who<br />\nput up a splendid game at goal<br />\nthroughout the contest. In a few<br />\nminutes the 'Varsity steadied,<br />\nand started scoring again. Pretty<br />\nmidfield work by the Suttons<br />\nworked the ball up toward the<br />\nposts, where several shots were<br />\nscored by the Knipp brothers<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 2)<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, APRIL 2, 1.917.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\naij Besides, the reputation of an old-established firm is<br />\nback of each sale with a guarantee.<br /><br />\nJohn C.

The<br />\nmenu for the dinner was made<br />\nout entirely in philosophical terms,<br />\nand each speaker and each member of the committee was designated by the name of some great<br />\nphilosopher. ,<br />\nAfter the dinner, the toastmaster, Alexander Randall, president of the class, introduced Dr.<br />\nSlonimsky as the principal speaker<br />\nof the evening.<br />\nDr. Slonomisky's talk dealt<br />\nmainly with a description of the<br />\nideal university and an exhortation to Hopkins students to assist in making Johns Hopkins approach its ideal. He first compared the European and the<br />\nAmerican university and showed<br />\nhow different was the influence of<br />\nthe university on society in this<br />\ncountry and abroad. There the<br />\nstudents are the leaders in all<br />\nradical reforms, and the generators of new thoughts and ideas.<br />\nIn contrast, the American student while more attractive in personality is, nevertheless, not as<br />\nwell developed along many lines.<br />\nAmerican universities, Dr. Slonimsky said, were becoming professional schools for the grinding<br />\nout of engineers, doctors, lawyers,<br />\netc., without teaching them anything of the cultural, classic side.<br />\nThe universities in this century<br />\nshould become the breeding places<br />\nfor ideas and the instruments for<br />\nspreading the humanities.<br />\nAnother prominent speaker was<br />\nRussell Murphy, or \"Murph,\" next<br />\nyear's football coach and athletic<br />\nadvisor. He unfolded, in part,<br />\nthe plan that he hopes to inaugurate next fall. He intends to look<br />\nto the future, to try to get as<br />\nmany students as possible in the<br />\nhabit of taking regular exercise,<br />\nand inducing them to continue<br />\nthis after they leave college, thus<br />\ngradually tending to build up the<br />\nphysical side of the men of this<br />\ncountry.<br />\nRobert Duncan also spoke, taking for his subject the \"Glory of<br />\nthe Class.\" He spoke of \"Bob\"<br />\nLayfleld and urged every member<br />\nof the class to follow their former<br />\nfriend and classmate as an ideal.<br />\n\"Hank\" Chalmers was the next<br />\nspeaker, using \"Class Spirit\" as<br />\nhis theme. \"Lefty\" Taylor recited, with an appropriate introduction, his original poem on the<br />\n\"Descent of Man.\" This amusing<br />\npiece presented Darwin's theories<br />\nin a striking way. Frank Sutton,<br />\nAlexander Wolfe, \"Admiral\" Jeff<br />\nMiller, Stuart Egerton, Henry<br />\nEvans and H.

They will always remember<br />\nthe sacrifice which he made for his<br />\nUniversity; always to them he<br />\nwill stand for the personification<br />\nof courage and loyalty. For those<br />\nmen, Layfield needs no monument; his name is writ upon their<br />\nhearts in letters more enduring<br />\nthan bronze.<br />\nYet, for the generations of Hopkins students who know the story<br />\nof Layfield only as it has been<br />\ntold to them, it is eminently fitting that his memory and the<br />\nthings for which he stood should<br />\nbe perpetuated in a tangible form.<br />\nSoon there will come the time<br />\nwhen not a student in the University has heard of Layfield but by<br />\nhearsay, when the knowledge that<br />\na man once gave his life for Hopkins will become a knowledge impersonal \u2014 a knowledge . only<br />\nvaguely present in University consciousness. It was to keep that<br />\nknowledge before the eyes of future classes that the idea of the<br />\nmemorial was conceived and carried out.<br />\nIt is not the bare fact that Layfield sacrificed his life for his University that is so meaningful; it<br />\nwas in the way in which he<br />\nmet his death that the nobility of<br />\nthe man shone forth so clearly.<br />\nFor weeks he lay upon his bed,<br />\nparalyzed, his body encased in<br />\nplaster. Yet, until the very end,<br />\nhe refused to surrender hope; with<br />\nthe same unquenchable courage<br />\nthat he had shown upon the football field, he fought long after his<br />\ndoctors had given up the battle\u2014<br />\na fight filled with an anguish that<br /><br />\nEvidence.<br /><br />\nA few weeks ago President<br />\nGoodnow officially announced that<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nstood prepared to serve the Government in whatever way it was<br />\nmost fitted. The action taken by<br />\nthe faculty last Saturday proved<br />\nconclusively that it was ready to<br />\nmake that promise good, and to<br />\nmake it good up to the hilt. In<br />\nthemselves, the beginning of University classes at 8.30, the immediate granting of degrees to Seniors who wish to enlist and the<br />\nexcusing of the members of the<br />\ncorps from classes for an entire<br />\nday, are unprecedented enough<br />\nin University history, yet these<br />\nthings are but the beginning\u2014<br />\nsteps taken before war has been<br />\ndeclared. There can be no possible doubt that if Hopkins does<br />\nnot close before its scheduled<br />\ntime, it will be only because of<br />\nthe fact that the University can<br />\nserve the Government more efficiently by remaining open.<br />\nThere was, however, a step<br />\ntaken by the faculty last Saturday which, in its implications,<br />\nwas even more significant than<br />\nthe steps taken in regard to University matters. The letter dispatched to President Wilson by<br />\nsixty-three members of the faculty<br />\nis far more than the expression<br />\nof the opinions of sixty-three individuals. The signers of that<br />\nletter represent one of the most<br />\nintellectual group of men in the<br />\nworld\u2014the fact that they have<br />\ngone on record as in favor both<br />\nof war with Germany and of universal military training has a far<br />\ngreater meaning than the mere<br />\nnumber of the men who affixed<br />\ntheir signatures to the plea would<br />\nin itself imply.<br />\nObviously, the Hopkins undergraduate body has not the weight<br />\nin matters of national import that<br />\nwould be accorded to the Hopkins faculty, but THE NEWS-LETTER believes that a canvass of the<br />\nstudents at the present time<br />\nwould show in most conclusive<br />\nfashion that the opinions of Hopkins students coincide very remarkably with the opinions of<br />\nHopkins professors.<br /><br />\nThe Season Opens.<br /><br />\nThere is something peculiarly<br />\nthrilling in the sight which Homewood Field presents on a spring<br />\nSaturday afternoon. The splatter<br />\nof colors on the grandstands, the<br />\nblack fringe surrounding the oval,<br />\nthe smooth expanse of green turf,<br />\nthe murmur of many voices, the<br />\ncheers,the tense silence that comes<br />\nover the stands when the attack<br />\nis close upon the goal\u2014surely,this<br />\nis not one of the most unpicturesque phases of college life.<br />\n-The game of lacrosse, too, which<br />\nHopkins has made so distinctively<br />\nits own\u2014no form of athletics, perhaps, is more breath-checking in<br />\nits intensity, and yet, more open<br />\nin its style of play. Other universities have failed as yet to realize<br />\nthe beauty of the game\u2014have kept<br />\nit as one of their minor sports;<br />\nHopkins men have known for<br />\ngenerations that there can be no<br />\nthrill greater than the thrill which<br />\ncomes when stick clashes with<br />\nstick, when lithe bodies dart down<br />\nthe field, passing the ball between<br />\nthem, when the quick swing and<br />\nthe rocking tell that the attack<br />\nhas been intercepted. There is an<br />\nexhilaration to the game, played<br />\nas Hopkins men play it, which no<br />\nother sport can surpass\u2014the keen<br />\nappreciation the grandstands experience in watching the perfect<br />\nco-ordination of mind and muscle<br />\nis as undiluted a tribute to beauty<br />\nas ever Greek paid to Doric<br />\ntemple.<br />\nSome there are who hold that<br />\nthe activities of a college should<br />\nbe restricted to lines strictly academic, who regard the enthusiasm<br />\nengendered over the success of<br />\ncollege teams as enthusiasm misplaced, and the energy consumed<br />\nin the development of those teams<br />\nas energy wasted. To such onlookers life must seem a drab and<br />\n,colorless thing, iron-bound with<br />\nduties, lacking all buoyancy and<br />\ngladness. Existence to them must<br />\nbe something to be endured; they<br />\nmust regard it with an immutable<br />\nseriousness\u2014assuredly, they can<br />\nnever realize the gifts the poets<br />\nbring.<br />\nLong ages ago, shaggy-breasted<br />\nmen fought for their lives with<br />\ncrawling, horny-scaled reptiles,<br />\nand, in the fight, first tasted the<br />\njoy that is inherent in combat.

Today, the call<br />\nfinds its legitimate expression<br />\nupon a grassy oval, bloodless; but<br />\nlet the caviler never say that the<br />\nspirit which evokes the sports of<br />\ncollege is a thing newly come upon<br />\nthe earth, nor yet a thing which<br />\ncan lightly and safely be undermined.<br /><br />\nGOUCHER1TES SUCCUMB TO<br />\nNAIVE JOYS OF CHILDHOOD<br /><br />\nFor the Goucher girl the enticement of the gleaming dance floor,<br />\neven the lure of the spring bonnet,<br />\naccording to the Goucher Weekly,<br />\nhave come to be as nothing.

The<br />\nonly point is whether the men in<br />\nthe class, in future years, would<br />\nbe more liable to pay the money to<br />\nthe University directly than, to<br />\npay the premiums on a policy<br />\nwhich, they would know, could<br />\nnever bear full results if the payments were discontinued.

The object of an<br />\nathletic policy is certainly not<br />\nmere winning of games, as so<br />\nmany assume, but is the physical<br />\ndevelopment of the college student. We should be glad on this<br />\nscore that we have none of those<br />\n\"athletic scholarships\" so common<br />\nin most universities where the<br />\nathletic policy wins games. The<br />\nwhole system however, tends to<br />\nthose who have dedevelop only'<br />\ncided athletic ability, leaving to<br />\nthe rest the opportunity for exercise only on the rooting stands.<br />\nHopkins suffers from this less,<br />\nperhaps, than other colleges, but<br />\nwe are now at a point of change<br />\nand must prepare for the eventuality of a larger student-body. A<br />\nuniversity is not an athletic training camp which should specialize<br />\non those who have athletic talents.<br />\nIt is a place of intellectual specialization and should see that<br />\nsound bodies are provided for<br />\ngood minds\u2014not following the ordinary fallacy of trying to improve the mind by making a<br />\nstrong body stronger.<br />\nThe tendency in athletic matters should be to lay more and<br />\nmore emphasis upon interclass<br />\ncontests and away from 'varsity<br />\nsports. Interclass athletics avoids<br />\nany danger of professionalization<br />\nand attracts far greater numbers.<br />\nIt may be urged that one could<br />\nnot get up as much enthusiasm<br />\nabout interclass contests as interuniversity ones. There is really<br />\nno reason why this should be. Objectively considered there is just<br />\nas much to be enthusiastic about<br />\nin both.<br />\nThis brings me to a criticism<br />\ndirected more against the studentbody as a whole than against the<br />\nathletic policy. We realize how<br />\nfoolish it would be to become excited about interclass contests,<br />\nand yet we yell ourselves hoarse<br />\nabout some football game. Is it<br />\nnot a disgrace that we can work<br />\nourselves into such a frenzy as to<br />\nbelieve that the winning of a<br />\ngame deserves a parade while we<br />\ntake no notice whatsoever of the<br /><br />\nRussian revolution, the most glorious event of a century?<br />\nThere is, of course, no institution at our college that is perfect,<br />\nand it would be both hopeless and<br />\nfoolish for me to attempt to criticise them all. Yet I feel that<br />\nthere are many things about the<br />\nmore important institutions which<br />\nhad better be said. Since I am<br />\napproaching these matters in a<br />\nthoughtful -and objective manner,<br />\nI ask that those of my fellow-students who read these letters will<br />\nmeet me half way with corresponding lack of passion and<br />\nprejudice.<br />\nAs an agency for \"social welfare\" the Y. M. C. A. at college is<br />\nundoubtedly excellent. For its<br />\nintention to combat against the<br />\nskepticism and agnosticism that<br />\nso often comes with college education it deserves the highest<br />\npraise. Yet, when we consider it<br />\napart from its intention, we must<br />\nregretfully recognize that it is one<br />\nof the strong forces against the<br />\nprogressive thought and intellectuality of our life. One might<br />\nexpect that the Y. M. C. A. would<br />\ninculcate in its members the<br />\ngreat ideals of humanity\u2014charity,<br />\ntolerance; yet it is among the<br />\nmembers of this organization that<br />\none finds the most intense and<br />\nfanatical intolerance. Whether<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A. encourages the<br />\ngrowth of these prejudices or not,<br />\ntheir continued existence bears<br />\ntestimony to a signal failure in<br />\nwhat should be its highest purpose.<br />\nI am at a loss to explain this<br />\nfailure unless the reason is to be<br />\nfound in the frantic efforts of the<br />\nY. M. C. A. in the face of the<br />\ngreat forces of skepticism to preserve anything, so that in the fear<br />\nof thinking too fast it refuses to<br />\nthink at all, and in attempting to<br />\nkeep the faith, it preserves also<br />\nthe prejudices and childishness of<br />\nthe Sunday-school.<br />\nDuring the last year the Menorah Society has attained quite<br />\nsome prominence as a part of the<br />\ncollege life of our Hebrew fellowstudents. It seems to me that<br />\nthis organization, by segregating<br />\nthat part of our student-body,<br />\nhelps to preserve racial prejudices<br />\nin much the same way that the<br />\nfraternities help to preserve class<br />\nprejudice. In European universities and in most of our American institutions the Hebrews are<br />\namong the most active forces for<br />\nthought and progress. This function they should exercise also at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt may be poor etiquette for me<br />\nto criticise my host, yet I must<br />\nsay that THE NEWS-LETTER is<br />\npetty\u2014not the sort of periodical<br />\none should expect at a great university. Outside of ,its editorials,<br />\nwhich are usually very good, it is<br />\ncomposed of stale news, trivial<br />\nnews\u2014news that everyone already<br />\nknows, or news that no one wants<br />\nto know.

An officer of the local naval recruiting<br />\nstation described the work of the<br />\n\"mosquito fleet\" and its inducements, and took the names of<br />\nthose who manifested interest.<br />\nThe Hopkins unit, if formed,<br />\nwould be a part of the Fifth<br />\nNaval District, which comprises<br />\nMaryland, Delaware, the District<br />\nof Columbia, Virginia, North<br />\nCarolina and South Carolina.<br />\nIts particular work would consist largely in patrolling the<br />\nChesapeake Bay and surrounding<br />\nwaters. Probably two or three<br />\nboats would be manned by this<br />\nunit, which would serve as harbor, mine or coast patrols, cooperate with United States submarines and aircraft, act as despatch boats and pursue hostile.<br />\nsubmarines.<br />\nIn size, the boats, probably<br />\neither yachts or motor powerboats, would range from forty to<br />\none hundred and ten feet long,<br />\nand the crews would vary from<br />\nfive to ten men. Each boat would<br />\nbe manned by an experienced ensign, several Hopkins students as<br />\npetty officers, a gunner's mate, a<br />\nboatswain and a few experienced<br />\nseamen.<br />\nThe recruiting officer remarked<br />\n'that each of the Hopkins contingent would have a good chance<br />\nto be chief petty officers. He also<br />\nquoted a navy man as saying that<br />\nif a college man is given fifteen<br />\nminutes' instruction he May make<br />\na better sailor than one who has<br />\nserved before the mast for fifteen<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe members of the unit would<br />\nenroll in the Naval Coast Defense<br />\nReserve for four years, but could<br />\nonly be called out in case of actual war or emergency. Moreover,<br />\nthey could not be transported to<br />\nanother district or to another<br />\nbranch of the naval service without their own sanction. Should<br />\nthe unit be established, its prospective members, after enrollment<br />\nat the recruiting office, would<br />\nbe given ten days' training under<br />\nthe direction of the commandant<br />\nof the Fifth Naval District. In<br />\naddition, they could enter three<br />\nmonths' actual service of their<br />\nown volition.
