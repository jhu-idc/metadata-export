If America<br />\nnow resorts to the sword, her recent efforts for peace will appear<br />\nhypocritical, or due to a priggish<br />\n'moral superiority' born of inexperience. She will have been<br />\nshamed into war by just those<br />\nconventional dogmas which she<br />\nhas pretended to despise.\" The<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\npamphlet is entitled, \"Collegians,<br />\nProtect Your Ideals!\"<br />\nNo better epitome than this<br />\ncould be obtained of the pacifists'<br />\nstand. To them, the national<br />\nhonor of our country is a thing<br />\nalways to be spoken of in quotation marks; to them, it is infinitely more important that<br />\npeace be preserved than that international law be maintained.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, international<br />\nlaw, compared .with the safety of<br />\npelf, seems to mean nothing at<br />\nall to them. From their standpoint, the object of all civilization is essentially negative-to<br />\nprevent bloodshed, rather than to<br />\npreserve the right.<br />\nThe great trouble with the advocates of peace at any price is<br />\nthat they see an evil before them,<br />\nand then screw their eyes tight,<br />\nutterly oblivious to the fact that<br />\nthere is an evil even greater than<br />\nthe one which they fear.<br />\nThe pacifists are not essentially<br />\nmoral-they are essentially unmoral. The greatest ideal in the<br />\nworld today is the ideal of international law-to refuse to believe that the country which deliberately transgresses the pitiably fem;' rules which it has taken<br />\nso long to establish should he<br />\npunished for its transgression, as<br />\na criminal is made to suffer for<br />\nthe murder which he has committed, does not signify a high sense<br />\nof righteousness, but a deliberate<br />\nand pernicious short-sightedness.<br />\n\"If America now resorts to the<br />\nsword, her recent efforts for peace<br />\nwill appear hypocritical, or due<br />\n\u2022to a priggish 'moral superiority'<br />\nborn of \"inexperience\"-in such<br />\nspecious arguments, such loose<br />\nphrases and meaningless rhetoric<br />\ndo the pacifists hide what is<br />\nreally the fundamental tenet of<br />\ntheir belief-the superiority of individual comfort and safety to<br />\ngroup morality.<br />\nThe plan of putting to a popular referendum the question as to<br />\nwhether the Government should<br />\nprotect American and international rights, or whether it should<br />\nsubmit in pious submission to<br />\nevery viOlation of the principles<br />\nof humanity which Germany sees<br />\nfit to perpetrate, is as un-American as it is hypocritical. To establish the precedent of taking a<br />\npopular vote every time that an<br />\nAmerican right was to be defended would be a step too ludicrous, we should imagine, to recommend itself even to the fervid<br />\n<br />\npacifist. There are certain functions of the State which are fundamental-most important of all,<br />\nthe protection of the lives and<br />\nproperty of its citizens; the mandate for the exercise of those<br />\nfunctions is not founded only<br />\nupon the temporary will of the<br />\npeople, but far moie upon the<br />\nbasic principles for whose fulfillment a state such as ours is<br />\ncalled into existence. Nor, we<br />\nsuspect, would the pacifists be so<br />\ninsistent in asking for a national<br />\nreferendum if they did not believe<br />\nthat they would be able to convince the people of the practical<br />\ncomforts of their ow-n \"peace-atany-price\" stand.<br />\nAt the present time, even with<br />\nthe knowledge of the Mexican<br />\nplot before its eyes, this country<br />\nis not anxious for war; it. would<br />\nrather, a thousand times, that the<br />\nsubmarine edict of Germany be<br />\nrepealed. But, failing that, war<br />\nseems inevitable. What the pacifists fail to realize is that war<br />\nmay be infinitely more righteous<br />\nthan peace-that the highest duty<br />\non earth is.fighting for the thing<br />\nin which you believe.<br />\n<br />\nDEAN VISITS SOUTHERN ALUMNI<br />\nGiven Enthusiastic Reception by Associations in Virginia and Georgia-All<br />\nWorking Hard for Hopkins-Interested in Military Training.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Murray Peabody Brush returned last week from a trip<br />\nthrough the South Atlantic<br />\nStates where he visited the various<br />\nHopkins Alumni Associations.<br />\nOn February 23 the Dean attended the banquet of the Alumni<br />\nAssociation at Richmond. It was<br />\nheld at the Jefferson Club and<br />\nwas attended by a large number<br />\nof the Hopkins graduates in Richmond.<br />\nOn Saturday,the twenty-fourth,<br />\nDoctor Brush spoke to the<br />\nAlumni Association at Atlanta,<br />\nGeorgia. He was much pleased<br />\nat the enthusiasm of the Hopkins<br />\nmen in Atlanta and at the work<br />\nthey were doing in Georgia to influence men to come to Homewood. Doctor Brush was also<br />\nentertained by the University of<br />\nGeorgia, speaking at chapel there<br />\nMonday morning.<br />\nThe Dean found that all the<br />\nAlumni in Georgia were especially interested in the military<br />\ndrills at Hopkins.

Certainly, however, our vehement<br />\ncorrespondent in this week's Mail<br />\nBag has not been alone in his<br />\nsuffering.<br />\nOn the other hand, the prolonged dearth of the customary<br />\npyramid of cups has resulted in<br />\nthe development, .by many Hopkins students, of a peculiar technique-the technique of directing<br />\nthe stream of water from a<br />\nfaucet into the mouth, rather<br />\nthan into the collar. There are<br />\ncertain fundamental difficulties<br />\nin the performance of this actdifficulties which can \u2022 only be<br />\neliminated by strict adherence to<br />\nthe following rules:<br />\n1. Get beneath the faucet before you turn it on-a lateral attack or even a trickle of water is<br />\nboth inefficient and disastrous.<br />\n2. Always remove the hat before taking the drink; if possible,<br />\nalso the collar and shirt.<br />\n3.

If America<br />\nnow resorts to the sword, her recent efforts for peace will appear<br />\nhypocritical, or due to a priggish<br />\n'moral superiority' born of inexperience. She will have been<br />\nshamed into war by just those<br />\nconventional dogmas which she<br />\nhas pretended to despise.\" The<br />\nIt<br /><br />\npamphlet is entitled, \"Collegians,<br />\nProtect Your Ideals!\"<br />\nNo better epitome than this<br />\ncould be obtained of the pacifists'<br />\nstand. To them, the national<br />\nhonor of our country is a thing<br />\nalways to be spoken of in quotation marks; to them, it is infinitely more important that<br />\npeace be preserved than that international law be maintained.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, international<br />\nlaw, compared .with the safety of<br />\npelf, seems to mean nothing at<br />\nall to them. From their standpoint, the object of all civilization is essentially negative-to<br />\nprevent bloodshed, rather than to<br />\npreserve the right.<br />\nThe great trouble with the advocates of peace at any price is<br />\nthat they see an evil before them,<br />\nand then screw their eyes tight,<br />\nutterly oblivious to the fact that<br />\nthere is an evil even greater than<br />\nthe one which they fear.<br />\nThe pacifists are not essentially<br />\nmoral-they are essentially unmoral. The greatest ideal in the<br />\nworld today is the ideal of international law-to refuse to believe that the country which deliberately transgresses the pitiably fem;' rules which it has taken<br />\nso long to establish should he<br />\npunished for its transgression, as<br />\na criminal is made to suffer for<br />\nthe murder which he has committed, does not signify a high sense<br />\nof righteousness, but a deliberate<br />\nand pernicious short-sightedness.<br />\n\"If America now resorts to the<br />\nsword, her recent efforts for peace<br />\nwill appear hypocritical, or due<br />\n\u2022to a priggish 'moral superiority'<br />\nborn of \"inexperience\"-in such<br />\nspecious arguments, such loose<br />\nphrases and meaningless rhetoric<br />\ndo the pacifists hide what is<br />\nreally the fundamental tenet of<br />\ntheir belief-the superiority of individual comfort and safety to<br />\ngroup morality.<br />\nThe plan of putting to a popular referendum the question as to<br />\nwhether the Government should<br />\nprotect American and international rights, or whether it should<br />\nsubmit in pious submission to<br />\nevery viOlation of the principles<br />\nof humanity which Germany sees<br />\nfit to perpetrate, is as un-American as it is hypocritical. To establish the precedent of taking a<br />\npopular vote every time that an<br />\nAmerican right was to be defended would be a step too ludicrous, we should imagine, to recommend itself even to the fervid<br /><br />\npacifist. There are certain functions of the State which are fundamental-most important of all,<br />\nthe protection of the lives and<br />\nproperty of its citizens; the mandate for the exercise of those<br />\nfunctions is not founded only<br />\nupon the temporary will of the<br />\npeople, but far moie upon the<br />\nbasic principles for whose fulfillment a state such as ours is<br />\ncalled into existence. Nor, we<br />\nsuspect, would the pacifists be so<br />\ninsistent in asking for a national<br />\nreferendum if they did not believe<br />\nthat they would be able to convince the people of the practical<br />\ncomforts of their ow-n \"peace-atany-price\" stand.<br />\nAt the present time, even with<br />\nthe knowledge of the Mexican<br />\nplot before its eyes, this country<br />\nis not anxious for war; it. would<br />\nrather, a thousand times, that the<br />\nsubmarine edict of Germany be<br />\nrepealed. But, failing that, war<br />\nseems inevitable. What the pacifists fail to realize is that war<br />\nmay be infinitely more righteous<br />\nthan peace-that the highest duty<br />\non earth is.fighting for the thing<br />\nin which you believe.<br /><br />\nDEAN VISITS SOUTHERN ALUMNI<br />\nGiven Enthusiastic Reception by Associations in Virginia and Georgia-All<br />\nWorking Hard for Hopkins-Interested in Military Training.<br /><br />\nDr. Murray Peabody Brush returned last week from a trip<br />\nthrough the South Atlantic<br />\nStates where he visited the various<br />\nHopkins Alumni Associations.<br />\nOn February 23 the Dean attended the banquet of the Alumni<br />\nAssociation at Richmond. It was<br />\nheld at the Jefferson Club and<br />\nwas attended by a large number<br />\nof the Hopkins graduates in Richmond.<br />\nOn Saturday,the twenty-fourth,<br />\nDoctor Brush spoke to the<br />\nAlumni Association at Atlanta,<br />\nGeorgia. He was much pleased<br />\nat the enthusiasm of the Hopkins<br />\nmen in Atlanta and at the work<br />\nthey were doing in Georgia to influence men to come to Homewood. Doctor Brush was also<br />\nentertained by the University of<br />\nGeorgia, speaking at chapel there<br />\nMonday morning.<br />\nThe Dean found that all the<br />\nAlumni in Georgia were especially interested in the military<br />\ndrills at Hopkins. They were<br />\nanxious to know how the drills<br />\nwere conducted and of the success<br />\nof the experiment.<br /><br />\nA Matter of Technique.<br /><br />\nWhether the prolonged emptiness of the sanitary cup receptacle immediately below the flight<br />\nof stairs to the left of the postoffice is due to a hitherto unsuspected clause in the contract<br />\nwhich the University made with<br />\nthe proprietors of the Barn soda<br />\nwater fountain, or whether .it is<br />\nmerely an indication of a deep,<br />\nalthough somewhat grim sense of<br />\nhumor on the part of the particular deii in machina who regulate<br />\nthe affairs of the basement, has<br />\nnot as yet been discovered. Certainly, however, our vehement<br />\ncorrespondent in this week's Mail<br />\nBag has not been alone in his<br />\nsuffering.<br />\nOn the other hand, the prolonged dearth of the customary<br />\npyramid of cups has resulted in<br />\nthe development, .by many Hopkins students, of a peculiar technique-the technique of directing<br />\nthe stream of water from a<br />\nfaucet into the mouth, rather<br />\nthan into the collar. There are<br />\ncertain fundamental difficulties<br />\nin the performance of this actdifficulties which can \u2022 only be<br />\neliminated by strict adherence to<br />\nthe following rules:<br />\n1. Get beneath the faucet before you turn it on-a lateral attack or even a trickle of water is<br />\nboth inefficient and disastrous.<br />\n2. Always remove the hat before taking the drink; if possible,<br />\nalso the collar and shirt.<br />\n3.
