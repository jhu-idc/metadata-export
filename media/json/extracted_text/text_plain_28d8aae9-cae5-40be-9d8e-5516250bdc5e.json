Financial aid<br />\nhas a significant effect on Hopkins students, yet few are aware<br />\nof how the financial aid system<br />\noperates.<br />\nIn order to improve the financial aid system at Hopkins<br />\nand give students a picture of<br />\nhow it works, Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid Susan Broadbent<br />\nhas suggested the possibility of<br />\nallowing students to participate<br />\nin making financial aid decisions. Although students would<br />\nnot be able to deal with the<br />\nspecific allocation of aid to individuals, it has been proposed<br />\nthat student input could be used in a general way by helping<br />\nto determine Hopkins' overall<br />\nfinancial aid policy. Broadbent<br />\nfeels that this type of student involvement could be appropriately achieved by allowing<br />\nstudents to express their opinions on a committee level.<br />\n<br />\nThis type of student input in<br />\nfinancial aid is already in practice at many other private colleges. At Barnard, a permanent<br />\ncommittee on student financial<br />\naid has been established which<br />\nsuccessfully involves students in<br />\ndetermining aid policies. This<br />\ncommittee, which consists of<br />\ntwo faculty members, two administrators, and three students, who are elected by the<br />\nstudent body, meets annually<br />\nfor three days during the intersession.

An NDSL is a needbased loan which must be repaid with 5 percent interest.<br />\nAdministered through the financial aid office, these loans can<br />\nrange anywhere from $200 to<br />\nI $3;000. Currently, 1500 Hopkins students hold an NDSL<br />\nloan for a total of $1.062<br />\nmillion.<br />\nA Guaranteed Student Loan<br />\n(GSL), is also a need-based<br />\nloan. It must be repaid with 9<br />\npercent interest. These loans are<br />\nI made by a lender such as a<br />\nI bank, a credit union or a savI<br />\nings and loan association.<br />\nGSLs, which are insured by the<br />\nfederal government, are made<br />\n1.061000 to $2000. A total of<br />\n<br />\n$1.4 million is owed by Hopkins students.<br />\nThe College Work Study<br />\nprogram provides jobs for students to help pay for their<br />\neducation expenses. An individual's CWS award depends<br />\non his need and the amount of<br />\nmoney available for the program. Wages, which range<br />\nfrom $3.35 to $5.00 per hour,<br />\nare paid directly to the student<br />\nby the University. A student is<br />\nallowed to work a maximum of<br />\n15 hours a week and can be<br />\nawarded no more than $1800<br />\nper academic year. More<br />\nstudents receive this type of aid<br />\nthan any other program; 1750<br />\nstudents for a total of $700,000.<br />\nThere are also a number of<br />\noutright grants which are sponsored by the federal government and administered through<br />\nthe Hopkins Financial Aid Office.

This type of aid is designed<br />\nprimarily to attract intellectually superior<br />\nstudents to the undergraduate body. Such a<br />\nscholarship would cover a substantial portion of a student's educational expenses,<br />\nperhaps over and above the cost of' tuition.<br />\nThis type of award would be very attractive,<br />\nmaking it difficult for an applicant to turn<br />\ndown admission to JHU. Only a few universities in America employ such methods to<br />\nrecruit high caliber students. Administrators<br />\nare currently talking about eventually attracting 10 percent of the undergraduate body in<br />\nthis manner.<br />\nMerit-based scholarships provide an excelleacopportunity to combine financial aid<br />\nwith the maintenance of high academic standards. However, it would be a mistake to<br />\nfund such a program at the expense of truly<br />\nneedy students. Equalizing educational opportunity for people of all economic<br />\nbackgrounds must remain the primary objective of financial aid policy. Merit-based<br />\nscholarships are a finedidea, as long as requirements for need-based financial aid are<br />\nsatisfied first. At this point it seems that the<br />\nUniversity has every intention of following<br />\nthis approach.<br />\nThe federal government's recent withdrawal of funds for student aid has resulted<br />\nin a shift of enrollment from private to state<br />\ninstitutions, according to figures from the<br />\n<br />\nNational Center for Education Statistics. It<br />\nis imperative that this.trend be stopped dead<br />\nin its tracks. It is disgraceful that a qualified<br />\nstudent can be denied the opportunity to<br />\nreceive a top-quality education at a top-notch<br />\nprivate institution due to his financial<br />\nbackground. In order to stop this pattern,<br />\nhowever, universities must be able to compensate for the dried-up federal dollars.<br />\nMuch of this new University-backed student aid would likely go toward financing<br />\nstudent loans and work study programs<br />\nrather than direct grants. This makes sense<br />\nbecause loan money can be recycled and thus<br />\noffered to a greater number of students than<br />\ndirect grants. With University-sponsored student aid programs, Hopkins would also acquire the ability to set its own standards. Present federal standards for loans and work<br />\nstudy forbid many students with middleincome backgrounds from obtaining assistance. Yet even a family earning 50 or 60<br />\nthousand dollars annually needs help in putting a child through an institution such as<br />\nHopkins, which costs over 11 thousand<br />\ndollars per year. Hopefully, Hopkins' standards for self-help types of aid would make<br />\naid available to a greater number of students<br />\nthan the federal standards presently permit.<br />\nHowever, University-backed financial aid<br />\nwould not only allow Hopkins more discretion in defining standards but it would provide a much needed cushion against further<br />\nfederal cutbacks.<br />\n<br />\nChanges In Financial Aid Administration<br />\nDeciding what future policies to pursue,<br />\nhowever, may in fact be easier than obtaining the money to implement them. Financial aid must receive a higher priority in the<br />\ndistribution of University funds. When the<br />\nCapital Campaign planning documents are<br />\ncompleted and condensed, University-sponsored aid must be placed at the head of the<br />\nlist of needs. More money should also come<br />\nfrom endowments. Efforts should be made<br />\nto both raise the endowment level and to<br />\ndevote a greater portion of this money to student aid. Currently, about 15 percent of endowment money finds its way to financial<br />\naid. A more reasonable figure would be 70<br />\npercent.<br />\nThere is also a need for change in the administration of financial aid at Hopkins. The<br />\nforemost problem is the lack of student involvement with the financial assistance administration. The Student Council has<br />\nrecently proposed the establishment of a<br />\nFinancial Aid Review Board to review appeals from students displeased with decisions<br />\nmade by the Financial Aid Office. The<br />\n<br />\nestablishment of such a board would be commendable, but the idea of student involvement should be pushed even further.<br />\nAt many other universities, aid policy and<br />\naward packages are determined by a committee of administrators, faculty and students. Such a system is needed at JHU.<br />\nDirect student involvement in administration<br />\nwould serve to make the financial aid process seem less mysiifying, confusing and<br />\nbureaucratic to undergraduates. Furthermore, it is important for the student viewpoint to be considered on matters of creating<br />\naid packages, deciding the ratio of self-help<br />\naid to direct grants, and having input to the<br />\ndirection of financial aid planning.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that undergraduates<br />\nknow so little about financial aid. It is a complex issue, but more needs to be done to inform students about types of aid currently<br />\navailable and developments in the political<br />\narena. It is the responsibility of student<br />\ngroups such as the News-Letter and the Student Council to go further in disseminating<br />\nsuch information.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nAndrew Hurley.............................

The<br />\nadministration will also gain<br />\nfrom this plan, as it will have<br />\na better idea of what students<br />\nwant, and it will not suffer as<br />\nmuch from the students' inability to understand the motives behind its actions.

Student involvement would help the financial<br />\naid administration as well as the<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nAll types of financial aid can<br />\nbe divided into two basic categories: self-help and outright<br />\ngrants. Self-help aid is the term<br />\nused to describe the National<br />\nDirect Student Loan and Guaranteed Student Loan programs,<br />\nand The College Work Study<br />\nprogram. These types of aid require some sort of obligation<br />\nfrom the student, whether it be<br />\nrepayment of a loan, or working a certain number of hours<br />\nper week. Outright grants are<br />\ndifferent and more desirable to<br />\nmost students since the grants<br />\ndo not obligate the student in<br />\nany way. The only exceptions<br />\nare those grants which stipulate<br />\nthat the student maintain a certain academic standard. At<br />\nHopkins, outright grants include government-sponsored<br />\nBell Grants and Supplemental<br />\nEducational. Opportunity<br />\nGrants (SEOGs) and University Funded Beneficial-Hodson<br />\nScholarships and Johns Hopkins Grants.<br />\nThe process of determining<br />\nan individual financial aid<br />\npackage is long and complex as<br />\nit involves a number of differgnt considerations. The process begins when the Financial<br />\nAid Office receives a list of admit d s.d\u00e7pts. From the<br />\n<br />\nfinancial aid forms submitted<br />\nby these students, family resources are determined. Financial aid officers enter each individual's financial data into a<br />\nformula derived by the federal<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nThere are a number of formulas available to financial aid<br />\noffices. The one used by this<br />\nuniversity is called Uniform<br />\nMethodology. Under Uniform<br />\nMethodology, considerations<br />\nare made for family income, expenses, assets and indebtedness,<br />\ntaxes, age of parents, and the<br />\nnumber of family members<br />\n(especially those attending<br />\ncollege).<br />\nUsing this formula, the financial aid officer can arrive at<br />\na figure which can be considered the family's total resources. This figure is then subtracted from the projected costs<br />\nfor the following year. For the<br />\n1982-83 year, projected costs<br />\nwere $11,300. The difference is<br />\nconsidered the student's \"demonstrated financial need.\"<br />\nIn past years, this demonstrated need was met with an<br />\naverage of 50 percent self-help<br />\nand 50 percent grants. However, this year, due to lack of<br />\nsufficient funding, a new system was implemented. Now,<br />\nthe first $3,250 is met by selfhelp forms of' aid. The remaining costs are met by outright<br />\ngrants.<br />\nIn devising each individual's<br />\npackage, his or her preference<br />\nfor types of self-help aid, loan<br />\nor work study, is taken into<br />\n<br />\nconsideration. The Financial<br />\nAid Office tries to maximize the<br />\neffect of their work by giving<br />\naid to as many people as possible. Therefore, they choose to<br />\nlimit the amount they award to<br />\na single student.<br />\nOnce these packages are<br />\nfinally devised, they are sent<br />\nback to the Admissions Office.<br />\nMost often the Financial Aid<br />\nOffice will not have sufficient<br />\nfunding to cover the costs of all<br />\nthe packages. Therefore, some<br />\nstudents, thought they have a<br />\npackage, will be put on a financial aid \"wait-list.\" It is entirely<br />\nup to the Admissions Office to<br />\ndecide who will receive definite<br />\naid offers. Of those wait-listed,<br />\nmost students eventually receive<br />\npartial or total aid<br />\nTo determine the financial<br />\naid for continuing students, the<br />\nFinancial Aid Office uses a<br />\nsimilar process and the same<br />\nformula. However, the Admis-<br />\n<br />\nsions Office is not involved in<br />\ndeciding which continuing students will receive aid.

Khalt Parcham, a<br />\nmember of the communist Afghan faction, became<br />\nhead of state, only to be ousted in June by N.M.<br />\nTaraki. Serving as his deputy was Haffizullah Amin,<br />\nwho killed Taraki in September 1979 under orders<br />\nfrom Soviet leaders.<br />\nThe Afghan resistance under Amin increased. And<br />\non December 27, 1979, the Soviet Union invaded<br />\nAfghanistan. The first announcement of the invasion<br />\nwas heard on Soviet radio with the next Afghan<br />\n\"stooge' leader still in the Soviet Union.<br />\nThe Soviet invasion, however, wasn't a surprise. The<br />\nmujahidin guerillas (Afghan freedom fighters) were increasing in number. And the Soviets also have a long<br />\nhistory of expansion. They are now 1000 miles into<br />\nAfghanistan, leaving them only 300 miles from the<br />\nPersian Gulf. They are also in the process of building<br />\nsix major air bases, and have positioned one-third of<br />\ntheir 110,000 troops along the Iran-Afghan border. All<br />\nthe Soviet troops stationed in Afghanistan only serve<br />\nsix-month shifts.<br />\nBefore the Soviet invasion, the Afghan population<br />\nnumbered 17 million. In 1982, there were four million<br />\nAfghan refugees, making them the world's largest<br />\nrefugee population. They flee mostly to Pakistan and<br />\nIran. The border between Afghanistan and Pakistan<br />\nis a free boundary because people from both sides<br />\ncome from the same families.<br />\nDuring the four years since the invasion, one million<br />\nAfghans have been killed by the Soviets and the<br />\nAfghan Communists, who control the major cities and<br />\nhighways during the day. On the average, at least one<br />\nmember of each Afghan family has been executed since<br />\n1979. They are killed for two reasons, for religious<br />\nbeliefs or for being a freedom fighter. If they are not<br />\nkilled, they are tortured and imprisoned. No exceptions are made for women or children.

Moscow initially dismissed<br />\nreports of the accidents as \"impudent slander,\" then<br />\nclaimed the deaths were due to spoiled meat, an explanation that is contradicted by all of the available<br />\nevidence. To this day, the Soviets have failed to explain the incident satisfactorily, thereby failing to meet<br />\ntheir obligation under the 1972 Biological Warfare<br />\nConvention, to \"cooperate in solving any problems<br />\nwhich may arise.\"<br />\nSOVIET REACTION<br />\nThe initial Soviet strategy for dealing with allegations of illegal chemical warfare activities was to play<br />\ndown the issue or confuse the argument by accusing<br />\n<br />\ngrass that was artifically seeded from the air by<br />\nAmerican military aircraft during the Vietnam war.<br />\nPaul Nelson is one of the world's experts on the<br />\nfusarium fungus. Nelson is a plant pathologist at Pennsylvania State University who has catalogued more<br />\nthan 6,000 isolates of fusarium, 300 of them toxinproducers. In his studies, he has never encountered any<br />\nreferences to a toxin-producing fusarium fungus in<br />\nAfghanistan. Although the fusarium fungus grows<br />\nnaturally in nearly every part of the world, Nelson said<br />\nit produces strong toxins only in cold and temperate<br />\nclimates.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nTHE UNITED NATIONS INVESTIGATES<br />\nThe group of investigators chosen by the U.N. to<br />\ninvestigate the alleged violations of international law<br />\nis headed by General Esmat Ezz of Egypt. Members<br />\nof the group included experts from Poland, Bulgaria,<br />\nKenya, Peru and the Philippines. They have been forbidden by the Afghan government to visit the alleged<br />\nscenes of chemical warfare. The U.N. investigation is<br />\nbeing overseen by U.N. Undersecretary General<br />\nviascheslav Ustinov.<br />\nIn February 1982, the U.N. group visited Afghan<br />\nrefugee camps in Pakistan where it obtained evidence<br />\nof chemical warfare. The U.N. team was given samples<br />\nof contaminated wheat grains, poisoned bullets, a gas<br />\nmask, part of a parachute from a chernical bomb and<br />\na fuse from a chemical hand bomb.<br />\nTREATY VIOLATIONS<br />\nChemical warfare has been prohibited on the battlefields of the western nations for over 50 years.<br />\nUnder the terms of the 1925 Geneva Protocoi, NA, ii;ch<br />\nthe Soviets signed, chemical methods of warfare are<br />\nbanned from military use. The 1972 Biological Warfare Convention, also signed by the Soviets, obliges<br />\nstates: \"never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain 1)<br />\nmicrobial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever<br />\ntheir origin or method of production, of types and<br />\nquantities that have no justification for prophylactic,<br />\nprotective or other peaceful purposes; 2) weapons,<br />\nequipment or means of delivery designed to use such<br />\nagents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed<br />\nconflict.\"<br />\nU.S. REACTION<br />\nThe Congress is expected to pass a resolution calling for material assistance to the Afghan freedom<br />\nfighlers.

The House sponsor of<br />\nan identical resolution is Representative Don Ritter,<br />\nR-Penn., who has long been active with the Afghan<br />\nresistance.<br />\nSenator Tsongas explained,\"The objectives of this<br />\nresolution are four-fold: first to convey to the Afghan<br />\npeople that the Congress has not forgotten them; second to -inform the administration that the Congress<br />\nregards Afghanistan as a logical place to contest Soviet<br />\naggression; third, to provide, as appropriate, material<br />\nassistance to the freedom fighters; and fourth, to<br />\nstrengthen the hand of the resistance in any negotiations with the Russians or their clients in Kabul.\" The<br />\nresolution also states that Soviet air bases in southwest<br />\nAfghanistan \"present an unacceptable threat to the<br />\nHormuz oil passage lanes, which are so vital to the free<br />\nworld's economics.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10/FEBRUARY 18, 1983<br />\n41.<br />\n<br />\n41M.<br />\n<br />\n4110.<br />\n<br />\n411.<br />\n<br />\n.dlo<br />\n<br />\n.111111.<br />\n<br />\n4111,-411.<br />\n<br />\n4110.<br />\n<br />\nIn Commemoration of<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nYear<br />\n\"The<br />\nMissile,\"The International<br />\nStudies Forum<br />\nLecture Series presents<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAfghan Youth Council<br />\n<br />\nFreedom Fighters In U.S.<br />\nle<br />\n<br />\nDR.

Sure we could have taken a bus for $18 (10<br />\nof which would have been refunded to us as a casino<br />\nbonus), like we'd done when we were freshmen, but<br />\nsomehow the car seemed the better way to go. So<br />\nwe loaded a case of beer, a half-gallon of screwdrivers and five people into a 1972, seven-cylinder<br />\nPontiac LeMans and hit the road about 5:00 on<br />\nFriday.<br />\nThe three-hour trip took us a total of four hours.<br />\nThe beer made rest stops an absolute necessity-1<br />\nstrongly recommend the Ogden Restaurant off the<br />\nJersey Turnpike, where, by the way, a \"smoking<br />\ndog\" novelty gift may be had for a mere 50 cents.<br />\nIncidentally, Exit 3A is the turnoff for the Atlantic City Expressway, not Exit 7, as we found out.<br />\n1 felt sorry for our driver, Mark. The only one<br />\nnot drinking, he had only 98 Rock to keep him company amidst a group of four rather drunk traveling companions. Since at this time 98 Rock was<br />\nthrobbing out a collection of new Journey, his was<br />\nnot an enviable position.<br />\nThe car ride had its moments. When we started<br />\nout in Baltimore I looked jOrward to the ride to<br />\nAtlantic City. But when I realized that we had a<br />\nthree-hour trip ahead of us, my mood mellowed.<br />\nI sat in the buck with the girls, Sue and Heather,<br />\nOen brutally caught in the medic,of their conversations.. As time passed, however, the drive seemed more like the heralded \"road trip.\" The beer<br />\nwarranted rest stops at occasionally interesting, but<br />\nusually less than glamorous spots, such as next to<br />\na blueberry field.<br />\n<br />\nAs we crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge into<br />\nNew Jersey, Sue and I soonfound ourselves trying<br />\nto defend our home state against the frequent<br />\ncriticisms of ourfriends. Thefirst sight coming over<br />\nthe bridge was a chemicalfactory, which didn't help<br />\nour argument much. I was hoping the pine barrens<br />\nwould impress them. They weren't overwhelmed,<br />\nhut at least they saw a side of New Jersey other than<br />\nthe traditional chemical dump.<br />\nAbout halfway across New Jersey we got lost,<br />\nmaking a three-hour trip into a four-hour drive.<br />\nOther memorable moments included spilling beer<br />\n<br />\non each other and going through at least seven or<br />\neight tolls.<br />\nThe ride did get a bit dull, even with the alcohol<br />\naccompaniment. As the boredom increased, so did<br />\nthe desperate nature of' our efforts to kill time. For<br />\ninstance, ripping a Michelob label so that you<br />\nremove the two \"e's\" in \"beer,\" while leasing the<br />\n\"b\" and \"r.\" Or, later on, naming all the songs,<br />\nin order, from all of Bruce Springsteen's albums.<br />\nWe knew we were near Atlantic City when we<br />\nbegan to come across a series of brightly lit<br />\nbillboards promoting a multitude ofentertainers for<br />\n<br />\nModern, streamlined boardwalk at night:\"Vou can almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they sell...\"<br />\n<br />\nRestaurant Review<br />\n<br />\nIs The Dugout Worth The Walk?<br />\nBY SUSIE PARKER<br />\nAND<br />\nKRISTIN CONRAD!<br />\nHaving ordered pizza from the Dugout many a<br />\ntime but having never actually been there, we decided to venture over to Greenmount Avenue. Unless<br />\nyou live nearby, it's worth the extra dollar for<br />\ndelivery, which starts after 6:00 p.m. and usually<br />\ntakes about a half hour. Neither of us knew what<br />\nto expect when we walked in and were therefore surprised to find that it is strictly a carry-out. The<br />\nrestaurant consists of only the counter where you<br />\nplace your order and a few video games.<br />\nIf you tire of what we consider to be our favorite<br />\nBaltimore pizza, an additional variety of food is offered. Some selections are: the Oriole burger (consisting of a quarter pound of meat on a Kaiser<br />\nroll\u2014$1.35), the Dugout steak sub (topped with<br />\ngreen peppers, mushrooms and provolone\u2014$2.35<br />\na halt', $4.75 for a whole), the fried fish basket<br />\n($2.35) and the chicken special (3 pieces of fried<br />\nchicken\u2014$2.95).<br />\nAlso offered is a wide variety of sub sandwiches,<br />\n<br />\nall priced within $1.75-$2.25 for half subs, and<br />\n$3.50-$4.50 for whole subs and including the Italian<br />\ncold cut sub, fried fish sub, chicken salad sub and<br />\nthe cheese fish sub, plus the two that we ordered,<br />\nthe pizza burger sub and the veal parmigiana sub.<br />\nThough somewhat soggy from the delivery wait,<br />\nthe subs were nonetheless pretty good. While the<br />\nsubs were good, ordering french fries turned out<br />\nto be a big mistake. Identifiable only by their basic<br />\nshape, we found them to be inedible.<br />\nThe best bet, we found, is to order the pizza,<br />\nwhich is available with toppings such as mushrooms, pepperoni, Italian sausage, onion or meat<br />\nsauce, or a combination of any two or three, or the<br />\nNew Yorker, complete with all the toppings. The<br />\nprices are $4.95 for regular, $5.95 with one topping,<br />\n$6.95 with two, $7.95 with three and $8.95 for the<br />\nNew Yorker. Nine-inch pies are also available between $3.50 and $6.50.<br />\nThe Dugout is located at 3403 Greetimouni A venue and is open from I 1:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on<br />\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,<br />\n/I0()(Lill. to 2:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday,<br />\nand 4:00 p.m. to 12:(X)a.m. on Sunday.

As we crossed the salt marshes on the<br />\noutskirts of the city we could see a bright mass of<br />\nlights looming in the distance. At first the skyline<br />\nwas nothing more than an overwhelming glow. But<br />\nas we drove nearer we could begin to discern the<br />\ndifferent casinos\u2014big, impersonal buildings towering above the old city, sporting colorful signs:<br />\n\"Tropicana,\" \"Golden Nugget,\" etc. . . Atlantic<br />\nCity is really two cities, the old part, consisting of<br />\ngray buildings in decay, and the new development<br />\nof casinos and hotels that seem to shout at you.<br />\nOur first stop was the Golden Nugget, a place<br />\nthat looked very ostentatious, but fairly uncrowded. No one had come to break the bank. At most,<br />\nI figured I could lose 40 dollars, if I gave up eating<br />\nt'or a week. I promptly dropped five dollars into a<br />\nnon-paying slot machine, and then watched in<br />\ndisbelief as Sue dropped her first quarter into the<br />\nsame machine and was rewarded with a six-dollar<br />\npayoff.<br />\nDisgusted and discouraged, I set oft' through the<br />\nrows of craps and roulette tables, weaving amidst<br />\nthrongs of ringing, blinking slots, in search of a<br />\nblackjack table. Blackjack's a real easy game; one<br />\nwhere it's very easy to kill one or two hours and<br />\ncome out about even financially. You rarely win<br />\nbig, but neither do you lose big, depending on the<br />\ncondition, of course, that you find a table with a<br />\nlow enough minimum to suit you. Now, the lowest<br />\nminimum you can usually find is three dollars.<br />\nHowever, tonight, I suppose because it was a<br />\nweekend, none of these cheap tables were to be<br />\nfound. The lowest available was five dollars\u2014too<br />\nrich for my blood.<br />\nWe needed pictures of Atlantic Cityfor the N-L,<br />\nso Heather and I set out for the boardwalk with<br />\nMark's expensive camera. As we attempted to load<br />\nthe camera on the beach, in the midst of a cold<br />\nsandstorm, we realized we were in great danger of<br />\ndestroying this delicate instrument. As iny numb<br />\nfingers awkwardly loaded the film, 1 dropped the<br />\ncamera case, which began tumbling towards the<br />\nocean in the brisk wind. After retrieving the sandcovered case, we took shots of the boardwalk. I was<br />\nglad the photo session was over, and hoping I<br />\nhadn't ruined Mark's camera. Half-frozen and<br />\nsand-pelleted, we quickly sought the warmth of the<br />\ncasinos.<br />\nWe pushed on to the Tropicana but (again unable<br />\nto find my illustrious cheap blackjack table) we<br />\nsettled into the lounge and ordered drinks, hoping<br />\n<br />\n\fAvoid 50-Year-Old Bunnies<br />\nthat as the crowds thinned, the minimums would<br />\nbecome lower. As luck would have it, though, we<br />\nhad no luck, and he among us who ventured forth<br />\nto gamble at a high-priced roulette table saw his<br />\nmoney dwindle. So we reversed our direction on the<br />\nboardwalk and made for the Playboy Club\u2014four<br />\nfloors of casino (only the bottom two were open)<br />\nand loads of young ladies clad in bunny suits.<br />\nI expected by now that I could not realize my fantasy of finding a low-minimum blackjack table, but<br />\nbehold, a three-dollar roulette table appeared.<br />\nHowever, I've never been very fond of roulette. So,<br />\nleaving three of our party at this table and the<br />\nfourth at the slot machines, I subdued my frugal<br />\ntendencies and sat down at a five-dollar blackjack<br />\ntable.<br />\nI was the first one there, but as soon as I sat<br />\ndown, I was joined by two or three fellow gamblers.<br />\nPushing out my modest 10 dollars in exchange for<br />\ntwo chips, the man next to me threw out a 100 dollar<br />\nbill, while the man at his left demanded change for<br />\nhis 50 dollars in chips. Unintimidated, I matched<br />\ntheir $15 and $25 bets with my one lonely chip. I<br />\nwas dealt a jack and an eight, and breathed a sigh<br />\nof relief\u2014a pretty good hand, especially since the<br />\ndealer's face-up card was a seven, and he had to<br />\nstand on 17. However, his face-down card was not<br />\na 10, but a six, and his hit turned out to be another<br />\nseven. So much for my 18.<br />\nIt was do or die now, as I pushed out my last<br />\nchip. I died; receiving an eight hit on a hand of 14.<br />\nTen dollars gone in about three minutes\u2014damn<br />\nFive-dollar tables.<br />\nHaving drunk more than my share of beer, my<br />\nconfidence in my gambling abilities was at a peak<br />\nas I left the bitter cold of the boardwalk and entered<br />\nthe crowded warmth ofPlayboy's casino. I had won<br />\neight, maybe 10 dollars on slot machines and frIt<br />\nthat it was time to try my hand at blackjack. Unfortunately, walking up to a blackjack tablefor the<br />\nfirst time is no easy matter. The slick hands of the<br />\ndealer, the relaxed middle-aged gamblers throwing<br />\naway hundreds of dollars and cracking had jokes,<br />\nand the flash of cards are all very impressive. My<br />\ndrunken courage was dwindling. As I approached<br />\n<br />\nminute of it (especially the bunnies clad in the tight<br />\nuniforms). I think 1 got too carried away, though.<br />\nAs My imagination ran wild, I lost track of my game<br />\nand hit on 19, drawing embarrassing stares.<br />\nNeedless to say, I came up a loser, a real loser. I<br />\nfelt stupid. The bunnies clad in the tight uniforms<br />\nwere some consolation, though.<br />\nMeanwhile, I'd found the cheap roulette table<br />\nagain and had decided to try my luck, as Mark<br />\nseemed to be holding his own. I sat down next to<br />\nhim and got 10 more dollars in chips. My first bet<br />\nwas in the 2-to-1 category, and it paid off. Beginner's luck. I bet red; it came up black. 1 bet odd;<br />\nit came up even. I tried the 2-to-1 line again\u2014<br />\nanother winner. Hey, 1 thought, this 2-to-1 stuff's<br />\nmy game. 1 can't lose.<br />\nAnd I didn't. Everytime 1 bet 2-to-1, I won.<br />\nHowever, while my stack of chips began to rise,<br />\nMark's began to dwindle. The other members of<br />\nour group didn't look too happy either, so we decided to go to another casino. I had recouped some<br />\nof my losses now, and I was feeling pretty good.<br />\nWe got back in the car and drove further north.<br />\nparallel to the boardwalk, toward Park Place. In<br />\ncase you havealt noticed the similarity, the streets<br />\nare named after a Monopoly board (or probably<br />\nvice versa). Pacific Avenue, Ventor, the red-color<br />\ngroup\u2014they're all here.<br />\nBally's casino is at Park Place, and we decided<br />\nto go in. It was about 1:00 a.m. Bally's, surprisingly, wasn't very crowded. Upon entering, I noticed the next best thing to cheap blackjack tables\u2014<br />\ndollar blackjack machines. I got my bills changed<br />\ninto coins\u2014Susan B. Anthonys (I didn't even know<br />\nthey were still around). After playing for a while,<br />\na drink at the bar was suggested, and I agreed. I've<br />\nheard that if you gamble in one place long enough,<br />\nthe waitresses will eventually come around and offer you free drinks, but it takes an incredibly long<br />\ntime for them to bring a drink back for you. I've<br />\nalso heard that it is really weak once you get it.<br />\nThings were bleak at Bally's. I had lost almost<br />\nall of my money and made a fool of myself A<br />\nhangover was beginning to heat in my head, saying, \"stupid, stupid, stupid. . .\" When myfriends<br />\n<br />\nThe Playbo) Club: bunnies, bunnies ever\u201ds.here, but nal-)a drop to drink.<br />\n<br />\nthe table, Ifelt ridiculous. Thefact that thy sleeves<br />\nof my hlue blazer(two sizes too small) were riding<br />\nhalfway up my forearms didn't help much either.<br />\nI wished I had drunk more. I nervously sat down<br />\nand began gambling.<br />\nIt wasn't long before I learned the slick, subtle<br />\nmoves of a true gambler. As smoke lazily drifted<br />\nacross the room, as bunnies clad in tight, scant<br />\nuniforms strolled by, I adopted a suave, casual pose<br />\n(reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca),<br />\nand I felt as if I was beginning to fit in with the<br />\ncrowd. Sure, I tried hitting on 18 andfailed. Sure,<br />\nI almost knocked someone's drink over as I watched a bunny clad in a very tight, scant uniform walk<br />\nby. That could be forgotten. I was going to bust<br />\nthis city wide open, teach this town the meaning of<br />\nthe word \"gamble,\"take 10 dollars to the limit and<br />\ncome out ahead, maybe 20 or 25 dollars. I was going to leave this place smoldering and love every<br />\n<br />\nstopped by and suggested we go to the bur for a<br />\ndrink I agreed, in spite of my hangover.<br />\nThe bar had live entertainment. As we walked in,<br />\nthe gray-haired lead singer of the quartet was telling the audience \"It's love. Love is all we've got.<br />\nAnd it's beautiful.\" If he were 20 years younger, he<br />\ncould have been Bill Murray playing Nick Rails on<br />\nthe Auto-Train.<br />\nI wasn't feeling too well, so I ordered a Coke,<br />\nwhich really didn't make me feel any better. The<br />\nlead singer in the felt tuxedo singing The Impossible Dream and telling us \"Hey, it's great to he here\"<br />\ndidn't help much either.<br />\nEveryone talked about their gambling experiences. No one seemed to have hit that elusive<br />\n\"jackpot.\" The singer was beginning to get on my<br />\nnerves. His version of\"New York, New York\" was<br />\non par with an easy-listening version of \"Let's Get<br />\nPhysical.\" As we left the bar, I was lucky enough to<br />\n<br />\nhear the start of/us pulsating version of \"(I Can't Get<br />\nNo)Satisfaction.\" It was the only time in my life I<br />\never felt like choking someone.<br />\nAs soon as we left the dark bar and entered the<br />\nbrightly lit casino, with thefamiliar clinking ofslot<br />\nmachines and the hurried conversations of people<br />\nwinning and losing money, a change came over me,<br />\nand an excitement grew in me. I knew I could win.<br />\nMy strategy was simple. I would take the two<br />\ndollars I had, play the slot machines until I made<br />\nfive or six dollars, go to the roulette table, and well,<br />\nfrom there the sky would he the limit. And,for the<br />\nmost part, my strategy worked. As I began winning<br />\nIfelt great. I laid down 25 and came away with 50.<br />\nAnd that was only my first quarter. Soon I had<br />\nmade five dollars, and I was ready for roulette.<br />\nThings only got better at the roulette table. I was<br />\nsoon up by 20 dollars. A wide grin came across my<br />\nface. The plump lady seated next to me caustically<br />\ntold me to remove my elbow from her arm, which<br />\nsomehow detracted from my moment ofjoy.<br />\n<br />\n1 was going to bust<br />\nthis city wide open, teach<br />\nthis town the meaning of<br />\nthe word 'gamble,' take<br />\n10 dollars to the limit and<br />\ncome out ahead, maybe<br />\n20 or 25 dollars. I wasloing to leave this place<br />\nsmoldering and love<br />\nevery minute of it<br />\n(especially the bunnies<br />\nclad in tight uniforms).<br />\nWe left Bally's about 2:00 and went across the<br />\nstreet to the Claridge, which is pretty small by<br />\nAtlantic City standards. You kind of feel sorry for<br />\nit\u2014like the runt of the litter.<br />\nOnce inside, I couldn't believe my eyes. All the<br />\ncasinos had dressed their waitresses in skimpy<br />\nuniforms, and some of these women had not exactly been stunning beauties, but the Claridge had<br />\ngone too far. They had stuck a 50-year old lady into one of these suits, with graying hair, bulging tummy, the works.<br />\nTurning my eyes away, I spied what I had been<br />\nsearching for all night\u2014a blackjack table with a<br />\nthree-dollar minimum. A small casino, 2:30 a.m.\u2014<br />\nit was about time.<br />\nUnfortunately, the table did me no good. I had<br />\nlooked all evening only to sit down and confidently lose not only my roulette winuings, but also the<br />\nrest.of my money. I kept getting hands of 15 and<br />\n16; hands that seemed too low to stand on, but too<br />\nhigh to hit, and whatever decision I made, it was<br />\nalways the wrong one ! slid despondently from the<br />\ntable with a single dollar left in my wallet.<br />\nWith no money, there's really nothing to do in<br />\nAtlantic Ctiy, and as I watched the others finish up<br />\ntheir gambling, I realized how tired I was.<br />\nMy self-pity trip was disturbed by Heather. She<br />\ndemanded that I come outside and look at what<br />\nshe'd found on the beach. Great, I thought,<br />\nseashells. Wrong. A horseshoe crab. She held it up<br />\ntriumphantly by the tail as three male casino patrons<br />\nwalked by. \"Horseshoe crab,\" she tried to explain,<br />\ngesturing at her prize. \"My first one.\" I pretended<br />\nI didn't know her and beat a hasty retreat back into the casino.<br />\nBy this time, everyone was getting tired. By<br />\nunanimous vote, we began the long trek home. The<br />\n,:rab was liberated, as Mark would not allow it in<br />\nthe car. With the Atlantic City skyline fading in the<br />\ndistance, we figured the final tallies: I had suffered<br />\na 40-dollar loss, Mark had lost $35, Heather had<br />\nwon $10, Sue had dropped $5 and Dave had proven the big winner, bringing home a gain of 25<br />\ndollars.<br />\nAs the sun came up, we stopped at a diner, sleepily agreeing that the trip had been tiring, costly (for<br />\nsome), and would have to be repeated.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14/FEBRUARY 18, 1983<br />\n<br />\n1111111111111111111111110111111<br />\nIMMIGRATION<br />\nPROBLEMS<br />\n<br />\nHey, c.4.JAcze-<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nPe pass,A otdaf a- er- f<br />\nparfy av-)ci r<br />\nc,-)e. zAJG.1(e A,,,<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nIP'<br />\n<br />\nCALL 332-4150<br />\n<br />\n/ -0--,,s?<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\nc_r(<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nValentine Response<br />\n<br />\n1--fere, f knot,)<br />\n<br />\n40<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nU.S. Visas, petitions, and appeals<br />\nLabor certification<br />\nDefense against Deportation<br />\nRelative Petitions<br />\nU.S. Citizenship<br />\n<br />\n....,<br />\n<br />\nIn response to our Valentine:<br />\n<br />\nCordon and Heneson P.A.<br />\nBlaustein Building<br />\nOne North Charles Street<br />\nBaltimore, MD 21201<br />\n<br />\nWe read your rhyme and found<br />\nit \"cute\"<br />\nThe blow was low, the point is<br />\nmoot.<br />\nA wise man said (and your lines<br />\nshow it)<br />\n\"Every fool is not a poet.\"<br />\nArlene, Bill and Mary<br />\n<br />\nGUADALAJARA<br />\nSUMMER<br />\nSCHOOL<br />\n<br />\nCNEMISTRy<br />\n<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n//<br />\n<br />\nworks<br />\n_,,./:<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nk<br />\n<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nDavid Epstein<br />\n(The Flintstones Quiz Writer)<br />\nP.S.

While other universities,<br />\nsuch as the University of Pennsylvania, offer similar dual<br />\ndegree options, Hopkins stands<br />\nalone in generally not requiring<br />\nGRE scores for admission to<br />\nthe advanced tracks.<br />\nIn both the School of Arts<br />\n<br />\nMost of the Bachelors/Masters Degree programs require at<br />\nleast one graduate seminar,<br />\nproficiency in a foreign<br />\nlanguage, some sort of comprehensive examination and a<br />\nthesis. There is very little difference between a senior essay<br />\nand a master's thesis, at least in<br />\nthe humanities departments.<br />\nSince seniors in these fields<br />\nhave to write a substantial<br />\nresearch paper anyway, the gap<br />\nin the amount of work a regular<br />\n<br />\nPerspectives On 1<br />\nAcademic Alternatives<br />\nand Sciences and the School of<br />\nEngineering, individual departments determine who is eligible<br />\nto enter a master's track. According to the Registrar, only<br />\neight A&S and three Engineering departments now have students concurrently enrolled as<br />\ngraduates and undergraduates.<br />\nAssistant Dean for Academic<br />\nStudies Martha Roseman and<br />\nhistory professor Ronald Walters<br />\nagree that the science departments are less inclined to accept<br />\na student wanting to work for<br />\na Bachelors/Masters degree.<br />\nNone have formal programs.<br />\nShe believes that masters<br />\ndegrees are awarded to graduate science students who are<br />\nunsuccessful candidates for the<br />\nPh.D. The Biology Department, according to Roseman, is<br />\nreluctant to admit students to<br />\nconcurrent graduate standing<br />\nalthough it has in the past,<br />\nwhen a strong interest was<br />\ndemonstrated. The same holds<br />\ntrue for the Chemistry Department, which now has two combined degree undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\ngraduate seminars are graded<br />\non a Pass/Fail basis. Under- I<br />\ngraduates must take these !<br />\ncourses for a letter grade, as a<br />\ngeneral rule. This, in turn,<br />\ncauses a discrepancy in the way<br />\nwork is evaluated between members of the same course. An artificial distinction, it nevertheless has provided a good<br />\ndeal of aggravation to the professor. \"If two people take the<br />\nsame course, they should be<br />\ngraded the same way,\" asserts<br />\nWalters.<br />\nSecondly, concurrent students hold an ambiguous place<br />\nwithin the University. They are<br />\nnot fully assimilated as graduate students nor are they strictly undergraduates. With the declining number of graduate<br />\nstudents, Roseman and Walters<br />\nbelieve the line between them<br />\nand BA/MA undergrads should<br />\nbe blurred more than it already<br />\nis. Departments should clearly<br />\nestablish how they perceive<br />\nundergraduates and full-time<br />\ngraduates to differ and make it<br />\nknown at the time of application for advanced itanding.<br />\nFinally, Walters has suggested, some of the area majors<br />\nshould establish tracks with<br />\ntheir own thesis programs<br />\nleading to a master of arts<br />\ndegree. In this way, more area<br />\nmajors would be able to salvage<br />\ntheir education by doing advanced work. While BA/MA<br />\nprograms do exist, they aren't<br />\nvery numerous or widespread<br />\nand aren't taken advantage of<br />\nto any great extent. Interested<br />\nundergraduates should check<br />\nwith their departments for further information on Hopkins'<br />\nattempt to combine undergraduate education with advanced research.<br />\n<br />\nsenior and one with concurrent<br />\ngraduate standing is further<br />\nnarrowed.<br />\nAccording to the Hopkins<br />\ncatalog, the programs in Engineering are more difficult<br />\nthan those in Arts and Sciences.<br />\nFor example, the four Electrical<br />\nEngineering BES/MS students<br />\nare required to take ten graduate seminars in their last two<br />\nor three years. Because no<br />\nUniversity-wide guideline exists, some dual degree recipients<br />\nmay be more prepared for further advanced graduate work<br />\nthan others. An engineering<br />\nstudent who needs to take ten<br />\nextra courses and write a thesis<br />\nshould be more knowledgeable<br />\nin his field than one who has<br />\nonly been required to take one<br />\nextra seminar. Because most<br />\nadvanced degree students go on<br />\nto graduate school, all will be<br />\nbetter prepared than others,<br />\nwith only bachelor's degrees,<br />\nentering at the same time.<br />\nSeveral administrative problems arise with these student In two weeks: Internships for<br />\ngroups.

The two pitchers with<br />\nthe best chances to make the<br />\nclub are Mike Boddicker and<br />\nJohn Flinn, both of whom saw<br />\nlimited action with the Orioles<br />\nlast year. The candidates for<br />\nthird base are: Rodriguez,<br />\nGlenn Gulliver and Leo Hernandez. Rodriguez, who is a<br />\nIS-year veteran with a career<br />\nbatting average of .241 and has<br />\nbeen with eight clubs, still has<br />\na strong arm and could do an<br />\nadequate job at third. Gulliver<br />\nplayed 50 games at third for the<br />\nO's last year, but showed little<br />\nfielding ability and batted only<br />\n.200.

The move is part<br />\nof a rearrangement of football<br />\nscheduling within the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference.<br />\nThrough 1982 the MAC was<br />\nsplit into two divisions for football play. Hopkins was a member of the eleven-team Southern<br />\nDivision. Each member of the.<br />\nSouthern Division played eight<br />\nof the eleven division schools<br />\nduring any given season. Schedules were compiled on a rotational basis and were changed<br />\nperiodically so that each team<br />\nwould eventually play every<br />\nother Southern Division team.<br />\nMeanwhile, the MAC Northern Division consisted of only<br />\neight learns.. ,Each Northern<br />\n<br />\nDivision school was able to play<br />\nits seven rival schools every<br />\nyear, a marked contrast to the<br />\nSouthern Division situation.<br />\nLast season the Blue Jays<br />\nplayed nine games, eight against<br />\nSouthern Division schools:<br />\nDickinson, Widener, Swarthmore, Moravian, Ursinus, Lebanon Valley, Muhlenberg and<br />\nWestern Maryland. To round<br />\nout their schedule, the gridders<br />\nsquared off against a Northern<br />\nDivision school, Wilkes. The<br />\nSouthern Division teams that<br />\nHopkins did not play in 1982<br />\nwere Liguysburg 4,04 Franklin<br />\n& Marshall.<br />\nMany of the MAC Southern<br />\nDivision schools were unhappy<br />\nwith the way the teams were<br />\norganized for football competition. Because of this, according<br />\nto .lay Coach Jerry Pfeifer,<br />\n\"the smaller schools have<br />\ndecided to form our own<br />\nleague.\"<br />\n<br />\nDirector Bob Scott. \"All of our<br />\nother [Division 111] sports are<br />\nremaining full-fledged in the<br />\nMAC.\"<br />\nThe new league will consist<br />\nof eight teams, all formally<br />\nmembers of the MAC's Southern Division. The teams are:<br />\nJ HU,Swarthmore, Gettysburg,<br />\nDickinson, Franklin & Marshall, Muhlenberg, Western<br />\nMaryland and Ursinus. All<br />\nleague schools will play each of<br />\nthe seven other league members<br />\nduring the football season.<br />\n<br />\nDivision play; and Wilkes, a<br />\nNorthern Division team with an<br />\noverall record of 1-8 for 1982.<br />\nIt also means that three<br />\nteams will be added to their<br />\nschedule. These teams are Gettysburg, F&M and Georgetown.<br />\nGeorgetown is an independent<br />\nschool, while the other two are<br />\nmembers of the new league.<br />\nLebanon Valley will become an<br />\nindependent school, and remain on the schedule.

This sum, in the form of<br />\ngrants, loans and scholarships<br />\nwas awarded to 60 percent of<br />\nthe student body. Financial aid<br />\nhas a significant effect on Hopkins students, yet few are aware<br />\nof how the financial aid system<br />\noperates.<br />\nIn order to improve the financial aid system at Hopkins<br />\nand give students a picture of<br />\nhow it works, Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid Susan Broadbent<br />\nhas suggested the possibility of<br />\nallowing students to participate<br />\nin making financial aid decisions. Although students would<br />\nnot be able to deal with the<br />\nspecific allocation of aid to individuals, it has been proposed<br />\nthat student input could be used in a general way by helping<br />\nto determine Hopkins' overall<br />\nfinancial aid policy. Broadbent<br />\nfeels that this type of student involvement could be appropriately achieved by allowing<br />\nstudents to express their opinions on a committee level.<br /><br />\nThis type of student input in<br />\nfinancial aid is already in practice at many other private colleges. At Barnard, a permanent<br />\ncommittee on student financial<br />\naid has been established which<br />\nsuccessfully involves students in<br />\ndetermining aid policies. This<br />\ncommittee, which consists of<br />\ntwo faculty members, two administrators, and three students, who are elected by the<br />\nstudent body, meets annually<br />\nfor three days during the intersession. Members of the<br />\ncommittee are first versed in the<br />\nschool's financial aid system.<br /><br />\nSusan Broadbent<br /><br />\nThey then discuss possible ways<br />\nto improve the old policies.<br />\nTheir proposals are drafted,<br />\nvoted on, and sent for adcont, on p. 6<br /><br />\nMany Types Of Aid<br />\nAre Available At JHU<br />\n1<br /><br />\nBY BETH BERMAN<br />\nAND MICHELLE ONELLO<br /><br />\nThe general term financial<br />\naid is used to describe many<br />\ndistinct forms of assistance<br />\nfrom a wide variety of sources.<br />\nIt encompasses anything from<br />\n, a $15 PTA scholarship to a<br />\n: $25(X) National Direct Student<br />\nI Loan.<br />\nAmong the many forms of<br />\nself-help programs is the National Direct Student Loan<br />\n(NDSL). An NDSL is a needbased loan which must be repaid with 5 percent interest.<br />\nAdministered through the financial aid office, these loans can<br />\nrange anywhere from $200 to<br />\nI $3;000. Currently, 1500 Hopkins students hold an NDSL<br />\nloan for a total of $1.062<br />\nmillion.<br />\nA Guaranteed Student Loan<br />\n(GSL), is also a need-based<br />\nloan. It must be repaid with 9<br />\npercent interest. These loans are<br />\nI made by a lender such as a<br />\nI bank, a credit union or a savI<br />\nings and loan association.<br />\nGSLs, which are insured by the<br />\nfederal government, are made<br />\n1.061000 to $2000. A total of<br /><br />\n$1.4 million is owed by Hopkins students.<br />\nThe College Work Study<br />\nprogram provides jobs for students to help pay for their<br />\neducation expenses. An individual's CWS award depends<br />\non his need and the amount of<br />\nmoney available for the program. Wages, which range<br />\nfrom $3.35 to $5.00 per hour,<br />\nare paid directly to the student<br />\nby the University. A student is<br />\nallowed to work a maximum of<br />\n15 hours a week and can be<br />\nawarded no more than $1800<br />\nper academic year. More<br />\nstudents receive this type of aid<br />\nthan any other program; 1750<br />\nstudents for a total of $700,000.<br />\nThere are also a number of<br />\noutright grants which are sponsored by the federal government and administered through<br />\nthe Hopkins Financial Aid Office. First among these is the<br />\nPell Grant, the largest federal<br />\nstudent aid program. The Department of Education establishes the formula which determines student eligibility for the<br />\nprogram.

This type of aid is designed<br />\nprimarily to attract intellectually superior<br />\nstudents to the undergraduate body. Such a<br />\nscholarship would cover a substantial portion of a student's educational expenses,<br />\nperhaps over and above the cost of' tuition.<br />\nThis type of award would be very attractive,<br />\nmaking it difficult for an applicant to turn<br />\ndown admission to JHU. Only a few universities in America employ such methods to<br />\nrecruit high caliber students. Administrators<br />\nare currently talking about eventually attracting 10 percent of the undergraduate body in<br />\nthis manner.<br />\nMerit-based scholarships provide an excelleacopportunity to combine financial aid<br />\nwith the maintenance of high academic standards. However, it would be a mistake to<br />\nfund such a program at the expense of truly<br />\nneedy students. Equalizing educational opportunity for people of all economic<br />\nbackgrounds must remain the primary objective of financial aid policy. Merit-based<br />\nscholarships are a finedidea, as long as requirements for need-based financial aid are<br />\nsatisfied first. At this point it seems that the<br />\nUniversity has every intention of following<br />\nthis approach.<br />\nThe federal government's recent withdrawal of funds for student aid has resulted<br />\nin a shift of enrollment from private to state<br />\ninstitutions, according to figures from the<br /><br />\nNational Center for Education Statistics. It<br />\nis imperative that this.trend be stopped dead<br />\nin its tracks. It is disgraceful that a qualified<br />\nstudent can be denied the opportunity to<br />\nreceive a top-quality education at a top-notch<br />\nprivate institution due to his financial<br />\nbackground. In order to stop this pattern,<br />\nhowever, universities must be able to compensate for the dried-up federal dollars.<br />\nMuch of this new University-backed student aid would likely go toward financing<br />\nstudent loans and work study programs<br />\nrather than direct grants. This makes sense<br />\nbecause loan money can be recycled and thus<br />\noffered to a greater number of students than<br />\ndirect grants. With University-sponsored student aid programs, Hopkins would also acquire the ability to set its own standards. Present federal standards for loans and work<br />\nstudy forbid many students with middleincome backgrounds from obtaining assistance. Yet even a family earning 50 or 60<br />\nthousand dollars annually needs help in putting a child through an institution such as<br />\nHopkins, which costs over 11 thousand<br />\ndollars per year. Hopefully, Hopkins' standards for self-help types of aid would make<br />\naid available to a greater number of students<br />\nthan the federal standards presently permit.<br />\nHowever, University-backed financial aid<br />\nwould not only allow Hopkins more discretion in defining standards but it would provide a much needed cushion against further<br />\nfederal cutbacks.<br /><br />\nChanges In Financial Aid Administration<br />\nDeciding what future policies to pursue,<br />\nhowever, may in fact be easier than obtaining the money to implement them. Financial aid must receive a higher priority in the<br />\ndistribution of University funds. When the<br />\nCapital Campaign planning documents are<br />\ncompleted and condensed, University-sponsored aid must be placed at the head of the<br />\nlist of needs. More money should also come<br />\nfrom endowments. Efforts should be made<br />\nto both raise the endowment level and to<br />\ndevote a greater portion of this money to student aid. Currently, about 15 percent of endowment money finds its way to financial<br />\naid. A more reasonable figure would be 70<br />\npercent.<br />\nThere is also a need for change in the administration of financial aid at Hopkins. The<br />\nforemost problem is the lack of student involvement with the financial assistance administration. The Student Council has<br />\nrecently proposed the establishment of a<br />\nFinancial Aid Review Board to review appeals from students displeased with decisions<br />\nmade by the Financial Aid Office. The<br /><br />\nestablishment of such a board would be commendable, but the idea of student involvement should be pushed even further.<br />\nAt many other universities, aid policy and<br />\naward packages are determined by a committee of administrators, faculty and students. Such a system is needed at JHU.<br />\nDirect student involvement in administration<br />\nwould serve to make the financial aid process seem less mysiifying, confusing and<br />\nbureaucratic to undergraduates. Furthermore, it is important for the student viewpoint to be considered on matters of creating<br />\naid packages, deciding the ratio of self-help<br />\naid to direct grants, and having input to the<br />\ndirection of financial aid planning.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that undergraduates<br />\nknow so little about financial aid. It is a complex issue, but more needs to be done to inform students about types of aid currently<br />\navailable and developments in the political<br />\narena. It is the responsibility of student<br />\ngroups such as the News-Letter and the Student Council to go further in disseminating<br />\nsuch information.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nAndrew Hurley.............................

The<br />\nadministration will also gain<br />\nfrom this plan, as it will have<br />\na better idea of what students<br />\nwant, and it will not suffer as<br />\nmuch from the students' inability to understand the motives behind its actions. This<br />\nsystem has worked at Barnard<br />\nand at Brown for the past 10-15<br />\nyears; with the guidance of<br />\nBroadbent it will be sure to<br />\nwork here.<br /><br />\nPAGE 6/FEBRUARY 18, 1983<br /><br />\nOther Schools Involve Students In Financial Aid<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nministrative approval.

Student involvement would help the financial<br />\naid administration as well as the<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nAll types of financial aid can<br />\nbe divided into two basic categories: self-help and outright<br />\ngrants. Self-help aid is the term<br />\nused to describe the National<br />\nDirect Student Loan and Guaranteed Student Loan programs,<br />\nand The College Work Study<br />\nprogram. These types of aid require some sort of obligation<br />\nfrom the student, whether it be<br />\nrepayment of a loan, or working a certain number of hours<br />\nper week. Outright grants are<br />\ndifferent and more desirable to<br />\nmost students since the grants<br />\ndo not obligate the student in<br />\nany way. The only exceptions<br />\nare those grants which stipulate<br />\nthat the student maintain a certain academic standard. At<br />\nHopkins, outright grants include government-sponsored<br />\nBell Grants and Supplemental<br />\nEducational. Opportunity<br />\nGrants (SEOGs) and University Funded Beneficial-Hodson<br />\nScholarships and Johns Hopkins Grants.<br />\nThe process of determining<br />\nan individual financial aid<br />\npackage is long and complex as<br />\nit involves a number of differgnt considerations. The process begins when the Financial<br />\nAid Office receives a list of admit d s.d\u00e7pts. From the<br /><br />\nfinancial aid forms submitted<br />\nby these students, family resources are determined. Financial aid officers enter each individual's financial data into a<br />\nformula derived by the federal<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nThere are a number of formulas available to financial aid<br />\noffices. The one used by this<br />\nuniversity is called Uniform<br />\nMethodology. Under Uniform<br />\nMethodology, considerations<br />\nare made for family income, expenses, assets and indebtedness,<br />\ntaxes, age of parents, and the<br />\nnumber of family members<br />\n(especially those attending<br />\ncollege).<br />\nUsing this formula, the financial aid officer can arrive at<br />\na figure which can be considered the family's total resources. This figure is then subtracted from the projected costs<br />\nfor the following year. For the<br />\n1982-83 year, projected costs<br />\nwere $11,300. The difference is<br />\nconsidered the student's \"demonstrated financial need.\"<br />\nIn past years, this demonstrated need was met with an<br />\naverage of 50 percent self-help<br />\nand 50 percent grants. However, this year, due to lack of<br />\nsufficient funding, a new system was implemented. Now,<br />\nthe first $3,250 is met by selfhelp forms of' aid. The remaining costs are met by outright<br />\ngrants.<br />\nIn devising each individual's<br />\npackage, his or her preference<br />\nfor types of self-help aid, loan<br />\nor work study, is taken into<br /><br />\nconsideration. The Financial<br />\nAid Office tries to maximize the<br />\neffect of their work by giving<br />\naid to as many people as possible. Therefore, they choose to<br />\nlimit the amount they award to<br />\na single student.<br />\nOnce these packages are<br />\nfinally devised, they are sent<br />\nback to the Admissions Office.<br />\nMost often the Financial Aid<br />\nOffice will not have sufficient<br />\nfunding to cover the costs of all<br />\nthe packages. Therefore, some<br />\nstudents, thought they have a<br />\npackage, will be put on a financial aid \"wait-list.\" It is entirely<br />\nup to the Admissions Office to<br />\ndecide who will receive definite<br />\naid offers. Of those wait-listed,<br />\nmost students eventually receive<br />\npartial or total aid<br />\nTo determine the financial<br />\naid for continuing students, the<br />\nFinancial Aid Office uses a<br />\nsimilar process and the same<br />\nformula. However, the Admis-<br /><br />\nsions Office is not involved in<br />\ndeciding which continuing students will receive aid. The<br />\namount of aid offered to these<br />\nstudents is determined by their<br />\nmost recent financial aid form<br />\n(FAF).<br />\nOf the total number of continuing students applying (or<br />\nreapplying) for aid each year,<br />\napproximately 10 percent are<br />\nrefused because they are put into the \"no-need\"category.<br />\nOften other continuing students<br />\nwill find their total amount of<br />\naid reduced.<br />\nFinancial aid packages are<br />\n-devised exclusively by the financial aid professionals: Director<br />\nSusan Broadbent, three financial coordinators, Assistant<br />\nDirector of Financial Aid and<br />\nAssistant Director of Graduate<br />\nFinancial Aid Anita Goodwin.<br />\nThese officers attempt to spend<br />\nat least a half-hour devising<br />\neach packet.<br /><br />\nAll Types Of Aid<br />\nAre Used At JHU<br />\ncont. from p. 1,<br />\nranging from $200 to $1800.<br />\nThe federal government also<br />\nsponsors Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants<br />\n(SEOG).

And<br />\non December 27, 1979, the Soviet Union invaded<br />\nAfghanistan. The first announcement of the invasion<br />\nwas heard on Soviet radio with the next Afghan<br />\n\"stooge' leader still in the Soviet Union.<br />\nThe Soviet invasion, however, wasn't a surprise. The<br />\nmujahidin guerillas (Afghan freedom fighters) were increasing in number. And the Soviets also have a long<br />\nhistory of expansion. They are now 1000 miles into<br />\nAfghanistan, leaving them only 300 miles from the<br />\nPersian Gulf. They are also in the process of building<br />\nsix major air bases, and have positioned one-third of<br />\ntheir 110,000 troops along the Iran-Afghan border. All<br />\nthe Soviet troops stationed in Afghanistan only serve<br />\nsix-month shifts.<br />\nBefore the Soviet invasion, the Afghan population<br />\nnumbered 17 million. In 1982, there were four million<br />\nAfghan refugees, making them the world's largest<br />\nrefugee population. They flee mostly to Pakistan and<br />\nIran.

An Afghan pathologist<br />\nwho later defected described accompanying Soviet<br />\nchemical warfare personnel into contaminated areas<br />\nto collect soil, vegetation and water samples after<br />\nSoviet chemical attacks. According to firsthand experience of former Soviet chemical personnel, the<br />\nSoviets do not require decontamination equipment in<br />\nan area where chemical bombs are stored or loaded<br />\nonto aircraft. Thus, deployment of this equipment in<br />\nAfghanistan must be assumed to be associated with<br />\nthe active employment of casualty-producing chemical<br />\nagents.<br />\nIn April 1979, an explosion at a top secret Soviet<br />\ndefense laboratory released a cloud of anthrax spores<br />\nin the vicinity of the city of Sverdlovsk, killing up to<br />\n1,000 Soviet citizens. Moscow initially dismissed<br />\nreports of the accidents as \"impudent slander,\" then<br />\nclaimed the deaths were due to spoiled meat, an explanation that is contradicted by all of the available<br />\nevidence. To this day, the Soviets have failed to explain the incident satisfactorily, thereby failing to meet<br />\ntheir obligation under the 1972 Biological Warfare<br />\nConvention, to \"cooperate in solving any problems<br />\nwhich may arise.\"<br />\nSOVIET REACTION<br />\nThe initial Soviet strategy for dealing with allegations of illegal chemical warfare activities was to play<br />\ndown the issue or confuse the argument by accusing<br /><br />\ngrass that was artifically seeded from the air by<br />\nAmerican military aircraft during the Vietnam war.<br />\nPaul Nelson is one of the world's experts on the<br />\nfusarium fungus.

Sure we could have taken a bus for $18 (10<br />\nof which would have been refunded to us as a casino<br />\nbonus), like we'd done when we were freshmen, but<br />\nsomehow the car seemed the better way to go. So<br />\nwe loaded a case of beer, a half-gallon of screwdrivers and five people into a 1972, seven-cylinder<br />\nPontiac LeMans and hit the road about 5:00 on<br />\nFriday.<br />\nThe three-hour trip took us a total of four hours.<br />\nThe beer made rest stops an absolute necessity-1<br />\nstrongly recommend the Ogden Restaurant off the<br />\nJersey Turnpike, where, by the way, a \"smoking<br />\ndog\" novelty gift may be had for a mere 50 cents.<br />\nIncidentally, Exit 3A is the turnoff for the Atlantic City Expressway, not Exit 7, as we found out.<br />\n1 felt sorry for our driver, Mark. The only one<br />\nnot drinking, he had only 98 Rock to keep him company amidst a group of four rather drunk traveling companions. Since at this time 98 Rock was<br />\nthrobbing out a collection of new Journey, his was<br />\nnot an enviable position.<br />\nThe car ride had its moments. When we started<br />\nout in Baltimore I looked jOrward to the ride to<br />\nAtlantic City. But when I realized that we had a<br />\nthree-hour trip ahead of us, my mood mellowed.<br />\nI sat in the buck with the girls, Sue and Heather,<br />\nOen brutally caught in the medic,of their conversations.. As time passed, however, the drive seemed more like the heralded \"road trip.\" The beer<br />\nwarranted rest stops at occasionally interesting, but<br />\nusually less than glamorous spots, such as next to<br />\na blueberry field.<br /><br />\nAs we crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge into<br />\nNew Jersey, Sue and I soonfound ourselves trying<br />\nto defend our home state against the frequent<br />\ncriticisms of ourfriends. Thefirst sight coming over<br />\nthe bridge was a chemicalfactory, which didn't help<br />\nour argument much. I was hoping the pine barrens<br />\nwould impress them. They weren't overwhelmed,<br />\nhut at least they saw a side of New Jersey other than<br />\nthe traditional chemical dump.<br />\nAbout halfway across New Jersey we got lost,<br />\nmaking a three-hour trip into a four-hour drive.<br />\nOther memorable moments included spilling beer<br /><br />\non each other and going through at least seven or<br />\neight tolls.<br />\nThe ride did get a bit dull, even with the alcohol<br />\naccompaniment. As the boredom increased, so did<br />\nthe desperate nature of' our efforts to kill time.

Unless<br />\nyou live nearby, it's worth the extra dollar for<br />\ndelivery, which starts after 6:00 p.m. and usually<br />\ntakes about a half hour. Neither of us knew what<br />\nto expect when we walked in and were therefore surprised to find that it is strictly a carry-out. The<br />\nrestaurant consists of only the counter where you<br />\nplace your order and a few video games.<br />\nIf you tire of what we consider to be our favorite<br />\nBaltimore pizza, an additional variety of food is offered.

While the<br />\nsubs were good, ordering french fries turned out<br />\nto be a big mistake. Identifiable only by their basic<br />\nshape, we found them to be inedible.<br />\nThe best bet, we found, is to order the pizza,<br />\nwhich is available with toppings such as mushrooms, pepperoni, Italian sausage, onion or meat<br />\nsauce, or a combination of any two or three, or the<br />\nNew Yorker, complete with all the toppings. The<br />\nprices are $4.95 for regular, $5.95 with one topping,<br />\n$6.95 with two, $7.95 with three and $8.95 for the<br />\nNew Yorker.

Atlantic<br />\nCity is really two cities, the old part, consisting of<br />\ngray buildings in decay, and the new development<br />\nof casinos and hotels that seem to shout at you.<br />\nOur first stop was the Golden Nugget, a place<br />\nthat looked very ostentatious, but fairly uncrowded. No one had come to break the bank. At most,<br />\nI figured I could lose 40 dollars, if I gave up eating<br />\nt'or a week. I promptly dropped five dollars into a<br />\nnon-paying slot machine, and then watched in<br />\ndisbelief as Sue dropped her first quarter into the<br />\nsame machine and was rewarded with a six-dollar<br />\npayoff.<br />\nDisgusted and discouraged, I set oft' through the<br />\nrows of craps and roulette tables, weaving amidst<br />\nthrongs of ringing, blinking slots, in search of a<br />\nblackjack table. Blackjack's a real easy game; one<br />\nwhere it's very easy to kill one or two hours and<br />\ncome out about even financially. You rarely win<br />\nbig, but neither do you lose big, depending on the<br />\ncondition, of course, that you find a table with a<br />\nlow enough minimum to suit you. Now, the lowest<br />\nminimum you can usually find is three dollars.<br />\nHowever, tonight, I suppose because it was a<br />\nweekend, none of these cheap tables were to be<br />\nfound. The lowest available was five dollars\u2014too<br />\nrich for my blood.<br />\nWe needed pictures of Atlantic Cityfor the N-L,<br />\nso Heather and I set out for the boardwalk with<br />\nMark's expensive camera. As we attempted to load<br />\nthe camera on the beach, in the midst of a cold<br />\nsandstorm, we realized we were in great danger of<br />\ndestroying this delicate instrument. As iny numb<br />\nfingers awkwardly loaded the film, 1 dropped the<br />\ncamera case, which began tumbling towards the<br />\nocean in the brisk wind. After retrieving the sandcovered case, we took shots of the boardwalk. I was<br />\nglad the photo session was over, and hoping I<br />\nhadn't ruined Mark's camera. Half-frozen and<br />\nsand-pelleted, we quickly sought the warmth of the<br />\ncasinos.<br />\nWe pushed on to the Tropicana but (again unable<br />\nto find my illustrious cheap blackjack table) we<br />\nsettled into the lounge and ordered drinks, hoping<br /><br />\nAvoid 50-Year-Old Bunnies<br />\nthat as the crowds thinned, the minimums would<br />\nbecome lower. As luck would have it, though, we<br />\nhad no luck, and he among us who ventured forth<br />\nto gamble at a high-priced roulette table saw his<br />\nmoney dwindle. So we reversed our direction on the<br />\nboardwalk and made for the Playboy Club\u2014four<br />\nfloors of casino (only the bottom two were open)<br />\nand loads of young ladies clad in bunny suits.<br />\nI expected by now that I could not realize my fantasy of finding a low-minimum blackjack table, but<br />\nbehold, a three-dollar roulette table appeared.<br />\nHowever, I've never been very fond of roulette. So,<br />\nleaving three of our party at this table and the<br />\nfourth at the slot machines, I subdued my frugal<br />\ntendencies and sat down at a five-dollar blackjack<br />\ntable.<br />\nI was the first one there, but as soon as I sat<br />\ndown, I was joined by two or three fellow gamblers.<br />\nPushing out my modest 10 dollars in exchange for<br />\ntwo chips, the man next to me threw out a 100 dollar<br />\nbill, while the man at his left demanded change for<br />\nhis 50 dollars in chips. Unintimidated, I matched<br />\ntheir $15 and $25 bets with my one lonely chip. I<br />\nwas dealt a jack and an eight, and breathed a sigh<br />\nof relief\u2014a pretty good hand, especially since the<br />\ndealer's face-up card was a seven, and he had to<br />\nstand on 17. However, his face-down card was not<br />\na 10, but a six, and his hit turned out to be another<br />\nseven. So much for my 18.<br />\nIt was do or die now, as I pushed out my last<br />\nchip. I died; receiving an eight hit on a hand of 14.<br />\nTen dollars gone in about three minutes\u2014damn<br />\nFive-dollar tables.<br />\nHaving drunk more than my share of beer, my<br />\nconfidence in my gambling abilities was at a peak<br />\nas I left the bitter cold of the boardwalk and entered<br />\nthe crowded warmth ofPlayboy's casino. I had won<br />\neight, maybe 10 dollars on slot machines and frIt<br />\nthat it was time to try my hand at blackjack. Unfortunately, walking up to a blackjack tablefor the<br />\nfirst time is no easy matter. The slick hands of the<br />\ndealer, the relaxed middle-aged gamblers throwing<br />\naway hundreds of dollars and cracking had jokes,<br />\nand the flash of cards are all very impressive. My<br />\ndrunken courage was dwindling. As I approached<br /><br />\nminute of it (especially the bunnies clad in the tight<br />\nuniforms). I think 1 got too carried away, though.<br />\nAs My imagination ran wild, I lost track of my game<br />\nand hit on 19, drawing embarrassing stares.<br />\nNeedless to say, I came up a loser, a real loser. I<br />\nfelt stupid. The bunnies clad in the tight uniforms<br />\nwere some consolation, though.<br />\nMeanwhile, I'd found the cheap roulette table<br />\nagain and had decided to try my luck, as Mark<br />\nseemed to be holding his own. I sat down next to<br />\nhim and got 10 more dollars in chips. My first bet<br />\nwas in the 2-to-1 category, and it paid off. Beginner's luck. I bet red; it came up black. 1 bet odd;<br />\nit came up even. I tried the 2-to-1 line again\u2014<br />\nanother winner. Hey, 1 thought, this 2-to-1 stuff's<br />\nmy game. 1 can't lose.<br />\nAnd I didn't. Everytime 1 bet 2-to-1, I won.<br />\nHowever, while my stack of chips began to rise,<br />\nMark's began to dwindle. The other members of<br />\nour group didn't look too happy either, so we decided to go to another casino. I had recouped some<br />\nof my losses now, and I was feeling pretty good.<br />\nWe got back in the car and drove further north.<br />\nparallel to the boardwalk, toward Park Place. In<br />\ncase you havealt noticed the similarity, the streets<br />\nare named after a Monopoly board (or probably<br />\nvice versa). Pacific Avenue, Ventor, the red-color<br />\ngroup\u2014they're all here.<br />\nBally's casino is at Park Place, and we decided<br />\nto go in. It was about 1:00 a.m. Bally's, surprisingly, wasn't very crowded. Upon entering, I noticed the next best thing to cheap blackjack tables\u2014<br />\ndollar blackjack machines. I got my bills changed<br />\ninto coins\u2014Susan B. Anthonys (I didn't even know<br />\nthey were still around). After playing for a while,<br />\na drink at the bar was suggested, and I agreed. I've<br />\nheard that if you gamble in one place long enough,<br />\nthe waitresses will eventually come around and offer you free drinks, but it takes an incredibly long<br />\ntime for them to bring a drink back for you. I've<br />\nalso heard that it is really weak once you get it.<br />\nThings were bleak at Bally's. I had lost almost<br />\nall of my money and made a fool of myself A<br />\nhangover was beginning to heat in my head, saying, \"stupid, stupid, stupid. . .\" When myfriends<br /><br />\nThe Playbo) Club: bunnies, bunnies ever\u201ds.here, but nal-)a drop to drink.<br /><br />\nthe table, Ifelt ridiculous. Thefact that thy sleeves<br />\nof my hlue blazer(two sizes too small) were riding<br />\nhalfway up my forearms didn't help much either.<br />\nI wished I had drunk more. I nervously sat down<br />\nand began gambling.<br />\nIt wasn't long before I learned the slick, subtle<br />\nmoves of a true gambler. As smoke lazily drifted<br />\nacross the room, as bunnies clad in tight, scant<br />\nuniforms strolled by, I adopted a suave, casual pose<br />\n(reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca),<br />\nand I felt as if I was beginning to fit in with the<br />\ncrowd. Sure, I tried hitting on 18 andfailed. Sure,<br />\nI almost knocked someone's drink over as I watched a bunny clad in a very tight, scant uniform walk<br />\nby. That could be forgotten. I was going to bust<br />\nthis city wide open, teach this town the meaning of<br />\nthe word \"gamble,\"take 10 dollars to the limit and<br />\ncome out ahead, maybe 20 or 25 dollars. I was going to leave this place smoldering and love every<br /><br />\nstopped by and suggested we go to the bur for a<br />\ndrink I agreed, in spite of my hangover.<br />\nThe bar had live entertainment. As we walked in,<br />\nthe gray-haired lead singer of the quartet was telling the audience \"It's love. Love is all we've got.<br />\nAnd it's beautiful.\" If he were 20 years younger, he<br />\ncould have been Bill Murray playing Nick Rails on<br />\nthe Auto-Train.<br />\nI wasn't feeling too well, so I ordered a Coke,<br />\nwhich really didn't make me feel any better. The<br />\nlead singer in the felt tuxedo singing The Impossible Dream and telling us \"Hey, it's great to he here\"<br />\ndidn't help much either.<br />\nEveryone talked about their gambling experiences. No one seemed to have hit that elusive<br />\n\"jackpot.\" The singer was beginning to get on my<br />\nnerves. His version of\"New York, New York\" was<br />\non par with an easy-listening version of \"Let's Get<br />\nPhysical.\" As we left the bar, I was lucky enough to<br /><br />\nhear the start of/us pulsating version of \"(I Can't Get<br />\nNo)Satisfaction.\" It was the only time in my life I<br />\never felt like choking someone.<br />\nAs soon as we left the dark bar and entered the<br />\nbrightly lit casino, with thefamiliar clinking ofslot<br />\nmachines and the hurried conversations of people<br />\nwinning and losing money, a change came over me,<br />\nand an excitement grew in me. I knew I could win.<br />\nMy strategy was simple. I would take the two<br />\ndollars I had, play the slot machines until I made<br />\nfive or six dollars, go to the roulette table, and well,<br />\nfrom there the sky would he the limit. And,for the<br />\nmost part, my strategy worked. As I began winning<br />\nIfelt great. I laid down 25 and came away with 50.<br />\nAnd that was only my first quarter. Soon I had<br />\nmade five dollars, and I was ready for roulette.<br />\nThings only got better at the roulette table. I was<br />\nsoon up by 20 dollars. A wide grin came across my<br />\nface. The plump lady seated next to me caustically<br />\ntold me to remove my elbow from her arm, which<br />\nsomehow detracted from my moment ofjoy.<br /><br />\n1 was going to bust<br />\nthis city wide open, teach<br />\nthis town the meaning of<br />\nthe word 'gamble,' take<br />\n10 dollars to the limit and<br />\ncome out ahead, maybe<br />\n20 or 25 dollars. I wasloing to leave this place<br />\nsmoldering and love<br />\nevery minute of it<br />\n(especially the bunnies<br />\nclad in tight uniforms).<br />\nWe left Bally's about 2:00 and went across the<br />\nstreet to the Claridge, which is pretty small by<br />\nAtlantic City standards. You kind of feel sorry for<br />\nit\u2014like the runt of the litter.<br />\nOnce inside, I couldn't believe my eyes. All the<br />\ncasinos had dressed their waitresses in skimpy<br />\nuniforms, and some of these women had not exactly been stunning beauties, but the Claridge had<br />\ngone too far. They had stuck a 50-year old lady into one of these suits, with graying hair, bulging tummy, the works.<br />\nTurning my eyes away, I spied what I had been<br />\nsearching for all night\u2014a blackjack table with a<br />\nthree-dollar minimum. A small casino, 2:30 a.m.\u2014<br />\nit was about time.<br />\nUnfortunately, the table did me no good. I had<br />\nlooked all evening only to sit down and confidently lose not only my roulette winuings, but also the<br />\nrest.of my money. I kept getting hands of 15 and<br />\n16; hands that seemed too low to stand on, but too<br />\nhigh to hit, and whatever decision I made, it was<br />\nalways the wrong one ! slid despondently from the<br />\ntable with a single dollar left in my wallet.<br />\nWith no money, there's really nothing to do in<br />\nAtlantic Ctiy, and as I watched the others finish up<br />\ntheir gambling, I realized how tired I was.<br />\nMy self-pity trip was disturbed by Heather. She<br />\ndemanded that I come outside and look at what<br />\nshe'd found on the beach. Great, I thought,<br />\nseashells. Wrong. A horseshoe crab. She held it up<br />\ntriumphantly by the tail as three male casino patrons<br />\nwalked by. \"Horseshoe crab,\" she tried to explain,<br />\ngesturing at her prize. \"My first one.\" I pretended<br />\nI didn't know her and beat a hasty retreat back into the casino.<br />\nBy this time, everyone was getting tired. By<br />\nunanimous vote, we began the long trek home. The<br />\n,:rab was liberated, as Mark would not allow it in<br />\nthe car. With the Atlantic City skyline fading in the<br />\ndistance, we figured the final tallies: I had suffered<br />\na 40-dollar loss, Mark had lost $35, Heather had<br />\nwon $10, Sue had dropped $5 and Dave had proven the big winner, bringing home a gain of 25<br />\ndollars.<br />\nAs the sun came up, we stopped at a diner, sleepily agreeing that the trip had been tiring, costly (for<br />\nsome), and would have to be repeated.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14/FEBRUARY 18, 1983<br /><br />\n1111111111111111111111110111111<br />\nIMMIGRATION<br />\nPROBLEMS<br /><br />\nHey, c.4.JAcze-<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\n/<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nPe pass,A otdaf a- er- f<br />\nparfy av-)ci r<br />\nc,-)e. zAJG.1(e A,,,<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nIP'<br /><br />\nCALL 332-4150<br /><br />\n/ -0--,,s?<br /><br />\n...<br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\nc_r(<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\nValentine Response<br /><br />\n1--fere, f knot,)<br /><br />\n40<br />\n.\u2022<br /><br />\n.\u2022<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nU.S. Visas, petitions, and appeals<br />\nLabor certification<br />\nDefense against Deportation<br />\nRelative Petitions<br />\nU.S. Citizenship<br /><br />\n....,<br /><br />\nIn response to our Valentine:<br /><br />\nCordon and Heneson P.A.<br />\nBlaustein Building<br />\nOne North Charles Street<br />\nBaltimore, MD 21201<br /><br />\nWe read your rhyme and found<br />\nit \"cute\"<br />\nThe blow was low, the point is<br />\nmoot.<br />\nA wise man said (and your lines<br />\nshow it)<br />\n\"Every fool is not a poet.\"<br />\nArlene, Bill and Mary<br /><br />\nGUADALAJARA<br />\nSUMMER<br />\nSCHOOL<br /><br />\nCNEMISTRy<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n//<br /><br />\nworks<br />\n_,,./:<br />\n/<br /><br />\nk<br /><br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nDavid Epstein<br />\n(The Flintstones Quiz Writer)<br />\nP.S.

While other universities,<br />\nsuch as the University of Pennsylvania, offer similar dual<br />\ndegree options, Hopkins stands<br />\nalone in generally not requiring<br />\nGRE scores for admission to<br />\nthe advanced tracks.<br />\nIn both the School of Arts<br /><br />\nMost of the Bachelors/Masters Degree programs require at<br />\nleast one graduate seminar,<br />\nproficiency in a foreign<br />\nlanguage, some sort of comprehensive examination and a<br />\nthesis. There is very little difference between a senior essay<br />\nand a master's thesis, at least in<br />\nthe humanities departments.<br />\nSince seniors in these fields<br />\nhave to write a substantial<br />\nresearch paper anyway, the gap<br />\nin the amount of work a regular<br /><br />\nPerspectives On 1<br />\nAcademic Alternatives<br />\nand Sciences and the School of<br />\nEngineering, individual departments determine who is eligible<br />\nto enter a master's track. According to the Registrar, only<br />\neight A&amp;S and three Engineering departments now have students concurrently enrolled as<br />\ngraduates and undergraduates.<br />\nAssistant Dean for Academic<br />\nStudies Martha Roseman and<br />\nhistory professor Ronald Walters<br />\nagree that the science departments are less inclined to accept<br />\na student wanting to work for<br />\na Bachelors/Masters degree.<br />\nNone have formal programs.<br />\nShe believes that masters<br />\ndegrees are awarded to graduate science students who are<br />\nunsuccessful candidates for the<br />\nPh.D. The Biology Department, according to Roseman, is<br />\nreluctant to admit students to<br />\nconcurrent graduate standing<br />\nalthough it has in the past,<br />\nwhen a strong interest was<br />\ndemonstrated. The same holds<br />\ntrue for the Chemistry Department, which now has two combined degree undergraduates.<br /><br />\ngraduate seminars are graded<br />\non a Pass/Fail basis. Under- I<br />\ngraduates must take these !<br />\ncourses for a letter grade, as a<br />\ngeneral rule. This, in turn,<br />\ncauses a discrepancy in the way<br />\nwork is evaluated between members of the same course. An artificial distinction, it nevertheless has provided a good<br />\ndeal of aggravation to the professor. \"If two people take the<br />\nsame course, they should be<br />\ngraded the same way,\" asserts<br />\nWalters.<br />\nSecondly, concurrent students hold an ambiguous place<br />\nwithin the University. They are<br />\nnot fully assimilated as graduate students nor are they strictly undergraduates. With the declining number of graduate<br />\nstudents, Roseman and Walters<br />\nbelieve the line between them<br />\nand BA/MA undergrads should<br />\nbe blurred more than it already<br />\nis. Departments should clearly<br />\nestablish how they perceive<br />\nundergraduates and full-time<br />\ngraduates to differ and make it<br />\nknown at the time of application for advanced itanding.<br />\nFinally, Walters has suggested, some of the area majors<br />\nshould establish tracks with<br />\ntheir own thesis programs<br />\nleading to a master of arts<br />\ndegree.

An engineering<br />\nstudent who needs to take ten<br />\nextra courses and write a thesis<br />\nshould be more knowledgeable<br />\nin his field than one who has<br />\nonly been required to take one<br />\nextra seminar.

The<br />\nroster will then have to be cut<br />\ndown to 25 players by opening<br />\nday. According to John Blake,<br />\nhead of the Orioles' public relations office, if there are no injuries the team will be essentially the same as last year. The<br />\noutfielding crew will consist of:<br />\nBenny Ayala, Al Bumbry, Jim<br />\nDwyer, Dan Ford, Gary Roenicke, John \"T-bone\" Shelby<br />\nand Ken Singleton.

The two pitchers with<br />\nthe best chances to make the<br />\nclub are Mike Boddicker and<br />\nJohn Flinn, both of whom saw<br />\nlimited action with the Orioles<br />\nlast year. The candidates for<br />\nthird base are: Rodriguez,<br />\nGlenn Gulliver and Leo Hernandez. Rodriguez, who is a<br />\nIS-year veteran with a career<br />\nbatting average of .241 and has<br />\nbeen with eight clubs, still has<br />\na strong arm and could do an<br />\nadequate job at third.

The move is part<br />\nof a rearrangement of football<br />\nscheduling within the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference.<br />\nThrough 1982 the MAC was<br />\nsplit into two divisions for football play. Hopkins was a member of the eleven-team Southern<br />\nDivision. Each member of the.<br />\nSouthern Division played eight<br />\nof the eleven division schools<br />\nduring any given season. Schedules were compiled on a rotational basis and were changed<br />\nperiodically so that each team<br />\nwould eventually play every<br />\nother Southern Division team.<br />\nMeanwhile, the MAC Northern Division consisted of only<br />\neight learns.. ,Each Northern<br /><br />\nDivision school was able to play<br />\nits seven rival schools every<br />\nyear, a marked contrast to the<br />\nSouthern Division situation.<br />\nLast season the Blue Jays<br />\nplayed nine games, eight against<br />\nSouthern Division schools:<br />\nDickinson, Widener, Swarthmore, Moravian, Ursinus, Lebanon Valley, Muhlenberg and<br />\nWestern Maryland. To round<br />\nout their schedule, the gridders<br />\nsquared off against a Northern<br />\nDivision school, Wilkes. The<br />\nSouthern Division teams that<br />\nHopkins did not play in 1982<br />\nwere Liguysburg 4,04 Franklin<br />\n&amp; Marshall.<br />\nMany of the MAC Southern<br />\nDivision schools were unhappy<br />\nwith the way the teams were<br />\norganized for football competition. Because of this, according<br />\nto .lay Coach Jerry Pfeifer,<br />\n\"the smaller schools have<br />\ndecided to form our own<br />\nleague.\"<br /><br />\nDirector Bob Scott. \"All of our<br />\nother [Division 111] sports are<br />\nremaining full-fledged in the<br />\nMAC.\"<br />\nThe new league will consist<br />\nof eight teams, all formally<br />\nmembers of the MAC's Southern Division. The teams are:<br />\nJ HU,Swarthmore, Gettysburg,<br />\nDickinson, Franklin &amp; Marshall, Muhlenberg, Western<br />\nMaryland and Ursinus.
