Dr.<br />\nWilliam H. Welch Was appointed<br />\nchairman of the committee, which<br />\nIS composed of the following members of the faculty:<br />\nProf. Basil L. Gildersleeve, Prof.<br />\nJoseph S. Ames, Prof. William B.<br />\nClark, Prof. William H. Howell,<br />\nProf. Westel W. Willoughby, and<br />\nDean Edward H. Griffin.<br />\nIt will be remembered that last<br />\nJune Dr. Remsen asked to be relieved of his executive duties, but<br />\nthe Board of Trustees persuaded<br />\nhim to remain as president of the<br />\nUniversity Until his successor could<br />\nbe chosen. Dr. Remsen consented<br />\nto do so, and directed the affairs<br />\nof the University until the first of<br />\nJanuary, when he went to the Hopkins Hospital for a slight operation.<br />\nHe was back at the University for<br />\na few hours last week, but did not<br />\nsettle down to take up his usual<br />\nduties, as his doctors had ordered<br />\nhim to take a vacation, in order that<br />\nhe might fully recuperate. Dr.<br />\nRemsen has prepared, therefore, to<br />\ntake a month's vacation at Camden,<br />\nS. C., for which place he leaves<br />\nTuesday. -In order that the University might not suffer from his continued absence, Dr. Remsen felt<br />\ncalled on to resign before going<br />\nSouth.<br />\nIt is understood -that a new president will not be decided upon in<br />\ntime for inaugtiration during this<br />\nacademic year. The Board oft'Trustees had under consideration a long<br />\nlist of names, which at one time<br />\nnumbered over a hundred.

Hopkins<br />\nis perfectly justified in doing everything in her power to let Woodrow<br />\nWilson perceive the pride she takes<br />\nin him. It is to be hoped that it<br />\nwas with this end in view that the<br />\nmanagers of the Fifth RegimentHopkins indoor games invited the<br />\nPresident-elect to referee the contests, but it must be said, flatly and<br />\nbluntly, that their action is open<br />\nto criticism.<br />\nNothing is an honor which does<br />\nnot in some way add to the recipient a dignity which he did not possess before. It is perfectly plain<br />\nthat to referee the Fifth RegimentHopkins contests could add nothing to Governor Wilson's dignity;<br />\nit would be the games, therefore,<br />\nand not the President-elect, who<br />\nwould be honored. Perhaps the<br />\nmanagers of the meet did not look<br />\nat the matter in this light; it is to<br />\nbe trusted that they did not, for in<br />\nit their action does not appear to<br />\nadvantage. The fact that their invitation was such as to confer honor,<br />\nnot on ,Governor Wilson but on the<br />\ngames, subjects that invitation to<br />\ninterpretation as an attempt to advertise the games through Governor<br />\nWilson; and no tendency of the day<br />\nis more to be regretted than the<br />\nusing of the names of men in public life for advertising purposes.<br />\nIt is not to be supposed that the<br />\nmanagers of the meet, in sending<br />\nthe invitation, had any such design,<br />\nbut it is unfortunate that they took<br />\na step capable of such interpretation.<br />\nIn 1902 Hopkins conferred on<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, then president of<br />\nPrinceton, the degree of doctor of<br />\n<br />\nlaws, the highest academic honor<br />\nwithin her gift. Since that time<br />\nother honors have come upon him,<br />\nwhich truly demand recognition<br />\nfrom his alma mater; but there is<br />\nonly one adequate way in which<br />\nwe can give that recognition. That<br />\nway is for the University, individually and collectively, to support his<br />\nefforts to safeguard the welfare of<br />\nthe American people; to incorporate<br />\ninto its principles and into its life<br />\nthe great ideals of law, liberty and<br />\ndemocracy, for which he is striving,<br />\nand that surpassing hatred of special privilege which has characterized his whole political career. The<br />\nbest way for Hopkins to honor<br />\nWoodrow Wilson is to support his<br />\nprinciples; the next best way is to<br />\nadmire him as the exponent of<br />\nthose principles; and it is to be<br />\nhoped that it was this admiration<br />\nrather than any commercial motive<br />\nthat led the managers of the -Fifth<br />\nRegiment-Hopkins games to extend<br />\nhim their unfortunate invitation.<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \"Clothes.\"<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats. ..<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

Rohde, Football Coach.<br />\n<br />\nMax Spencer Rohde, former star<br />\ntackle of the University of Chicago<br />\neleven, and whose playing with the<br />\nJohns Hopkins eleven two seasons<br />\nago won for him the almost unanimous choice of pickers of all-Maryland teams as guard, was selected<br />\nyesterday to coach the Hopkins<br />\neleven during the 1913 season.<br />\nThe football advisers \u2014 Horace<br />\nBurroughs and Dr. Harvey Stone\u2014<br />\ndecided upon Rohde after considering a number of applicants, many<br />\nof whom 'were former Hopkins<br />\nmen, at a preliminary meeting, and<br />\nwhen his name was presented to<br />\nthe Athletic Board yesterday at five<br />\no'clock it received ratification at<br />\nonce. The meeting, which was executive, lasted about an hour, which<br />\nis comparatively short for such<br />\nmeetings.<br />\nRohde is in New York, and although he has not formally accepted<br />\nthe position, there is no doubt that<br />\nhe will, because he wants to do some<br />\npost-graduate work at the University.<br />\nThe new coach graduated from<br />\nChicago in\u2022 19o8. He had played<br />\nat tackle for two years and was<br />\npicked as a star player by many<br />\nWestern papers and experts. He<br />\ncame to the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, but was not on the local<br />\neleven until season before last. Although he had not played for three<br />\nyears, it did not take long to get<br />\nin trim, and his work was of the<br />\nfirst order. He was right guard,<br />\nplaying centre when Hopkins was<br />\non defensive. Rohde is 26 years<br />\nold and lives at Princeton, Ill.<br />\nThe selection came as a surprise<br />\nto many followers of Hopkins football. While Rohde always was a<br />\npopular player, he did not. come<br />\ninto contact with undergraduate<br />\nlife at Hopkins, and the general<br />\nfootball following did not get to<br />\nknow him well.

He told of the<br />\ncheering effects in after life of the<br />\nremembrance of some particularly<br />\nbrilliant play during one's college<br />\ndays. He also advised all present<br />\nat the meeting to use their heads<br />\nto help correct their deficiencies, and<br />\nsaid that in this way they would be<br />\nfar more likely to make a position<br />\non the team; if not the first year,<br />\nthen after several years of trying,<br />\nthey would be sure to be rewarded.<br />\nCoach Eddie Hooper gave a<br />\nsnappy little 'talk.

JOHN SHARP DICKINSON,<br />\nEditor THE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDear Sir\u2014The practical value of<br />\nthe question recently raised of making- the University more widely<br />\nknown has been repeatedly forced<br />\nhome to me since I have been out<br />\nhere in the Middle West, where, to<br />\nnine out of ten people, Johns Hopkins means \"medial school.\"<br />\nThis condition is, I think, largely<br />\ndue to the wider publicity given in<br />\nthe past to the Hospital. I am a<br />\ncareful reader of three Chicago<br />\nnewspapers, and I can vouch that<br />\nthe stories about the new technical<br />\nschool (lid not average \"two sticks,\"<br />\nabout five inches. On the other<br />\nhand, not a week goes by that there<br />\nis not some item from the Hospital.<br />\nIf the patient who has gone under<br />\nthe knife is picturesque or popular,<br />\nthe item often runs half a column.<br />\nWe all appreciate the work done<br />\nat the Medical School, but we know<br />\nthat this is but a part of the University's achievements. The publicity that has been given that important department is but a promise<br />\nof what can be done for the rest<br />\nof the University.<br />\nFrom a practical standpoint, the<br />\nwork being done for the University is highly inefficient. There is<br />\na well known formula used by advertising men to test the probable<br />\nvalue of publicity. It is: Circulation<br />\nmultiplied . by hiving powcr and<br />\ndivided by cost. Apply this formula to the Hopkins alumni teaching in another institution. What is<br />\nhis \"circulation\"?\u2014only those persons with whom he comes in contact, or who may know of him by<br />\nreputation. What is the \"buying<br />\npower\" of those persons ?\u2014only so<br />\nmany who plan postgraduate work<br />\nor who have sons going to college,<br />\nqualified always by the financial<br />\nability to conic to Baltimore. What<br />\nis the \"cost\"?\u2014possibly it is nothing, but the cost is the least important factor in the equation, \"for any<br />\nrate is too high if the circulation and<br />\n<br />\nbuying power are not there.\" It is<br />\nplain that the circulation is small<br />\nand the buying power very limited.<br />\nMoreover, most teaching alumni<br />\ntook their baccalaureate degree at<br />\nother colleges, and their affections<br />\ncling to their college rather than<br />\ntheir University. Scholastically, they<br />\nare Hopkins men; sentimentally,<br />\nthey are not. We all know of members of the faculty whose Ph.D. or<br />\nM.D. was won at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwho have sent their boys back to<br />\ntheir own college.<br />\nNow, apply the same formula to<br />\nthe \"University Circular.\" By these<br />\ncoldblooded tests the two forms of<br />\npublicity mainly relied on by the<br />\nfaculty, according to Dr. Buchner,<br />\nshow up as pretty poor \"result getcrs.\"<br />\nOne would be silly to try to discredit the value of any successful<br />\nalumni to the University. The importance of good will and of reputation are appreciated by everyone.<br />\nNobody can doubt but that the<br />\n\"University Circular\" is a necessary, proper publication, well filling<br />\nits purpose. But publicity for the<br />\nUniversity is, in its last analysis,<br />\na straightforward business proposition. It can be effectively accomplished in a dignified way by other<br />\nmeans than through our own alumni<br />\nand the University publications.<br />\nCould not a Publicity Committee<br />\nbe formed to do this very important<br />\nwork? It might well be composed of<br />\na trustee of the University, a member of the faculty, the registrar, the<br />\neditor of the new alumni paper, the<br />\neditor of THE NEWS-LETTER and a<br />\ncouple of alumni, preferably men<br />\nliving in or near Baltimore. Such<br />\na committee should be headquarters<br />\nfor Hopkins news, and they should<br />\nuse every proper and dignified<br />\nmeans to bring the University to<br />\nthe wider attention of the country.<br />\nA great deal could be accomplished<br />\nat very little expense. I can promise<br />\nthat committee one willing helper<br />\nout in Chicago.<br />\nThis is a long letter, but I hope<br />\nmy great love for Johns Hopkins<br />\nand my experience in the advertising and publishing fields may be<br />\nsufficient excuse.<br />\nVery sincerely yours,<br />\n<br />\nWILLIAMS HAYNES.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nGlee and Instrumental Clubs Showing<br />\nUp Well in the Rehearsals\u2014Dance<br />\nto Follow the Concert.<br />\n<br />\nToo much cannot be said in praise<br />\nof the fine showing that both the<br />\nGlee and Instrumental Clubs have<br />\nmade in the rehearsals last week in<br />\npreparation for the annual concert<br />\nof the combined Musical Clubs to<br />\nbe given on Tuesday night, February ii, in McCoy Hall. Without the slightest exaggeration, it<br />\ncan be stated that the Musical Clubs<br />\nare in better shape than ever before<br />\nin the history of the University.<br />\nAs has been the custom for the<br />\npast two years, a short dance will<br />\nfollow the concert. This will add<br />\nmuch to the evening's entertainment, especially for the younger<br />\npersons in the audience. The list<br />\nof patronesses which will be announced in the latter part of this<br />\nweek is a very fashionable one.<br />\nUnique posters have been issued<br />\nfor the concert, but the management greatly fears that the design<br />\nhas proven almost too attractive,<br />\nand that instead of placing them in<br />\nthe store windows, where they<br />\nwould do the most good, many of<br />\nthe students have appropriated<br />\nposters for the purpose of decorating their walls at home. To supply<br />\nthe need for wall decorations the<br />\nmanagement has had a limited number of copies of the \"Glee Club<br />\nSinger\" printed on heavy white<br />\ncardboard, without any advertising,<br />\nand these can be obtained for the<br />\nsmall sum of five cents apiece, as<br />\nlong as they hold out. Ben Tappan, who drew the famous \"Glee<br />\nClub Singer,\" was clever enough<br />\nto somewhat disguise the features<br />\nof the member of the Hopkins Glee<br />\nClub that he had in mind while<br />\nmaking the drawing. There is quite<br />\na difference of opinion as to which<br />\nmember of the Club the drawing<br />\nmost resembles. A free copy of<br />\nthe drawing, suitable for framing,<br />\nwill be presented to the reader of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER making the most<br />\nplausible suggestion as to the member of the Club the drawing is<br />\nreally intended to represent.<br />\nContestants' Note\u2014Observe carefully the features of the accompaning reproduction of the \"Glee Club<br />\nSinger\" in the adjoining column,<br />\nand after thinking over the matter<br />\nwrite out the name of the original<br />\nof the drawing and give the reasons for your choice in not more<br />\nthan twenty-five words.

Dr.<br />\nWilliam H. Welch Was appointed<br />\nchairman of the committee, which<br />\nIS composed of the following members of the faculty:<br />\nProf. Basil L. Gildersleeve, Prof.<br />\nJoseph S. Ames, Prof. William B.<br />\nClark, Prof. William H. Howell,<br />\nProf. Westel W. Willoughby, and<br />\nDean Edward H. Griffin.<br />\nIt will be remembered that last<br />\nJune Dr. Remsen asked to be relieved of his executive duties, but<br />\nthe Board of Trustees persuaded<br />\nhim to remain as president of the<br />\nUniversity Until his successor could<br />\nbe chosen. Dr. Remsen consented<br />\nto do so, and directed the affairs<br />\nof the University until the first of<br />\nJanuary, when he went to the Hopkins Hospital for a slight operation.<br />\nHe was back at the University for<br />\na few hours last week, but did not<br />\nsettle down to take up his usual<br />\nduties, as his doctors had ordered<br />\nhim to take a vacation, in order that<br />\nhe might fully recuperate. Dr.<br />\nRemsen has prepared, therefore, to<br />\ntake a month's vacation at Camden,<br />\nS. C., for which place he leaves<br />\nTuesday. -In order that the University might not suffer from his continued absence, Dr. Remsen felt<br />\ncalled on to resign before going<br />\nSouth.<br />\nIt is understood -that a new president will not be decided upon in<br />\ntime for inaugtiration during this<br />\nacademic year.

Hopkins<br />\nis perfectly justified in doing everything in her power to let Woodrow<br />\nWilson perceive the pride she takes<br />\nin him. It is to be hoped that it<br />\nwas with this end in view that the<br />\nmanagers of the Fifth RegimentHopkins indoor games invited the<br />\nPresident-elect to referee the contests, but it must be said, flatly and<br />\nbluntly, that their action is open<br />\nto criticism.<br />\nNothing is an honor which does<br />\nnot in some way add to the recipient a dignity which he did not possess before. It is perfectly plain<br />\nthat to referee the Fifth RegimentHopkins contests could add nothing to Governor Wilson's dignity;<br />\nit would be the games, therefore,<br />\nand not the President-elect, who<br />\nwould be honored. Perhaps the<br />\nmanagers of the meet did not look<br />\nat the matter in this light; it is to<br />\nbe trusted that they did not, for in<br />\nit their action does not appear to<br />\nadvantage. The fact that their invitation was such as to confer honor,<br />\nnot on ,Governor Wilson but on the<br />\ngames, subjects that invitation to<br />\ninterpretation as an attempt to advertise the games through Governor<br />\nWilson; and no tendency of the day<br />\nis more to be regretted than the<br />\nusing of the names of men in public life for advertising purposes.<br />\nIt is not to be supposed that the<br />\nmanagers of the meet, in sending<br />\nthe invitation, had any such design,<br />\nbut it is unfortunate that they took<br />\na step capable of such interpretation.<br />\nIn 1902 Hopkins conferred on<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, then president of<br />\nPrinceton, the degree of doctor of<br /><br />\nlaws, the highest academic honor<br />\nwithin her gift. Since that time<br />\nother honors have come upon him,<br />\nwhich truly demand recognition<br />\nfrom his alma mater; but there is<br />\nonly one adequate way in which<br />\nwe can give that recognition. That<br />\nway is for the University, individually and collectively, to support his<br />\nefforts to safeguard the welfare of<br />\nthe American people; to incorporate<br />\ninto its principles and into its life<br />\nthe great ideals of law, liberty and<br />\ndemocracy, for which he is striving,<br />\nand that surpassing hatred of special privilege which has characterized his whole political career. The<br />\nbest way for Hopkins to honor<br />\nWoodrow Wilson is to support his<br />\nprinciples; the next best way is to<br />\nadmire him as the exponent of<br />\nthose principles; and it is to be<br />\nhoped that it was this admiration<br />\nrather than any commercial motive<br />\nthat led the managers of the -Fifth<br />\nRegiment-Hopkins games to extend<br />\nhim their unfortunate invitation.<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \"Clothes.\"<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats. ..<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br /><br />\nATTENTION!

Rohde, Football Coach.<br /><br />\nMax Spencer Rohde, former star<br />\ntackle of the University of Chicago<br />\neleven, and whose playing with the<br />\nJohns Hopkins eleven two seasons<br />\nago won for him the almost unanimous choice of pickers of all-Maryland teams as guard, was selected<br />\nyesterday to coach the Hopkins<br />\neleven during the 1913 season.<br />\nThe football advisers \u2014 Horace<br />\nBurroughs and Dr. Harvey Stone\u2014<br />\ndecided upon Rohde after considering a number of applicants, many<br />\nof whom 'were former Hopkins<br />\nmen, at a preliminary meeting, and<br />\nwhen his name was presented to<br />\nthe Athletic Board yesterday at five<br />\no'clock it received ratification at<br />\nonce. The meeting, which was executive, lasted about an hour, which<br />\nis comparatively short for such<br />\nmeetings.<br />\nRohde is in New York, and although he has not formally accepted<br />\nthe position, there is no doubt that<br />\nhe will, because he wants to do some<br />\npost-graduate work at the University.<br />\nThe new coach graduated from<br />\nChicago in\u2022 19o8. He had played<br />\nat tackle for two years and was<br />\npicked as a star player by many<br />\nWestern papers and experts. He<br />\ncame to the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, but was not on the local<br />\neleven until season before last. Although he had not played for three<br />\nyears, it did not take long to get<br />\nin trim, and his work was of the<br />\nfirst order. He was right guard,<br />\nplaying centre when Hopkins was<br />\non defensive. Rohde is 26 years<br />\nold and lives at Princeton, Ill.<br />\nThe selection came as a surprise<br />\nto many followers of Hopkins football. While Rohde always was a<br />\npopular player, he did not. come<br />\ninto contact with undergraduate<br />\nlife at Hopkins, and the general<br />\nfootball following did not get to<br />\nknow him well. As a player he was<br />\nquiet, steady and could always be<br />\nrelied upon to make a hole in the.<br />\nopposing line.<br /><br />\nThe Big Stationery Store<br />\nBaltimore and Howard Streets<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br /><br />\nThe utmost<br />\nin style, fit<br />\nand service.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 .1\":\u2022\u2022\u2022*.i:&gt;<br /><br />\nWe are now in the throes of our<br /><br />\nGREAT HALF -YEARLY CLEARANCE SALE<br />\nwhich offers to the public an advantage as to prices<br />\ncomprehending our entire Stock.\u2014It is very much a<br />\nquegtion if ever such Bargains were offered before<br />\nduring mid-winter.\u2014Every Department participates,<br />\nand we invite our public to share in the liberal<br />\ndi\u00a7tribution of our Merchandise during this week.<br /><br />\nY.M.

JOHN SHARP DICKINSON,<br />\nEditor THE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDear Sir\u2014The practical value of<br />\nthe question recently raised of making- the University more widely<br />\nknown has been repeatedly forced<br />\nhome to me since I have been out<br />\nhere in the Middle West, where, to<br />\nnine out of ten people, Johns Hopkins means \"medial school.\"<br />\nThis condition is, I think, largely<br />\ndue to the wider publicity given in<br />\nthe past to the Hospital. I am a<br />\ncareful reader of three Chicago<br />\nnewspapers, and I can vouch that<br />\nthe stories about the new technical<br />\nschool (lid not average \"two sticks,\"<br />\nabout five inches. On the other<br />\nhand, not a week goes by that there<br />\nis not some item from the Hospital.<br />\nIf the patient who has gone under<br />\nthe knife is picturesque or popular,<br />\nthe item often runs half a column.<br />\nWe all appreciate the work done<br />\nat the Medical School, but we know<br />\nthat this is but a part of the University's achievements. The publicity that has been given that important department is but a promise<br />\nof what can be done for the rest<br />\nof the University.<br />\nFrom a practical standpoint, the<br />\nwork being done for the University is highly inefficient. There is<br />\na well known formula used by advertising men to test the probable<br />\nvalue of publicity. It is: Circulation<br />\nmultiplied . by hiving powcr and<br />\ndivided by cost. Apply this formula to the Hopkins alumni teaching in another institution. What is<br />\nhis \"circulation\"?\u2014only those persons with whom he comes in contact, or who may know of him by<br />\nreputation. What is the \"buying<br />\npower\" of those persons ?\u2014only so<br />\nmany who plan postgraduate work<br />\nor who have sons going to college,<br />\nqualified always by the financial<br />\nability to conic to Baltimore. What<br />\nis the \"cost\"?\u2014possibly it is nothing, but the cost is the least important factor in the equation, \"for any<br />\nrate is too high if the circulation and<br /><br />\nbuying power are not there.\" It is<br />\nplain that the circulation is small<br />\nand the buying power very limited.<br />\nMoreover, most teaching alumni<br />\ntook their baccalaureate degree at<br />\nother colleges, and their affections<br />\ncling to their college rather than<br />\ntheir University. Scholastically, they<br />\nare Hopkins men; sentimentally,<br />\nthey are not. We all know of members of the faculty whose Ph.D. or<br />\nM.D. was won at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwho have sent their boys back to<br />\ntheir own college.<br />\nNow, apply the same formula to<br />\nthe \"University Circular.\" By these<br />\ncoldblooded tests the two forms of<br />\npublicity mainly relied on by the<br />\nfaculty, according to Dr. Buchner,<br />\nshow up as pretty poor \"result getcrs.\"<br />\nOne would be silly to try to discredit the value of any successful<br />\nalumni to the University. The importance of good will and of reputation are appreciated by everyone.<br />\nNobody can doubt but that the<br />\n\"University Circular\" is a necessary, proper publication, well filling<br />\nits purpose. But publicity for the<br />\nUniversity is, in its last analysis,<br />\na straightforward business proposition. It can be effectively accomplished in a dignified way by other<br />\nmeans than through our own alumni<br />\nand the University publications.<br />\nCould not a Publicity Committee<br />\nbe formed to do this very important<br />\nwork? It might well be composed of<br />\na trustee of the University, a member of the faculty, the registrar, the<br />\neditor of the new alumni paper, the<br />\neditor of THE NEWS-LETTER and a<br />\ncouple of alumni, preferably men<br />\nliving in or near Baltimore. Such<br />\na committee should be headquarters<br />\nfor Hopkins news, and they should<br />\nuse every proper and dignified<br />\nmeans to bring the University to<br />\nthe wider attention of the country.<br />\nA great deal could be accomplished<br />\nat very little expense. I can promise<br />\nthat committee one willing helper<br />\nout in Chicago.<br />\nThis is a long letter, but I hope<br />\nmy great love for Johns Hopkins<br />\nand my experience in the advertising and publishing fields may be<br />\nsufficient excuse.<br />\nVery sincerely yours,<br /><br />\nWILLIAMS HAYNES.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nGlee and Instrumental Clubs Showing<br />\nUp Well in the Rehearsals\u2014Dance<br />\nto Follow the Concert.<br /><br />\nToo much cannot be said in praise<br />\nof the fine showing that both the<br />\nGlee and Instrumental Clubs have<br />\nmade in the rehearsals last week in<br />\npreparation for the annual concert<br />\nof the combined Musical Clubs to<br />\nbe given on Tuesday night, February ii, in McCoy Hall. Without the slightest exaggeration, it<br />\ncan be stated that the Musical Clubs<br />\nare in better shape than ever before<br />\nin the history of the University.<br />\nAs has been the custom for the<br />\npast two years, a short dance will<br />\nfollow the concert. This will add<br />\nmuch to the evening's entertainment, especially for the younger<br />\npersons in the audience. The list<br />\nof patronesses which will be announced in the latter part of this<br />\nweek is a very fashionable one.<br />\nUnique posters have been issued<br />\nfor the concert, but the management greatly fears that the design<br />\nhas proven almost too attractive,<br />\nand that instead of placing them in<br />\nthe store windows, where they<br />\nwould do the most good, many of<br />\nthe students have appropriated<br />\nposters for the purpose of decorating their walls at home. To supply<br />\nthe need for wall decorations the<br />\nmanagement has had a limited number of copies of the \"Glee Club<br />\nSinger\" printed on heavy white<br />\ncardboard, without any advertising,<br />\nand these can be obtained for the<br />\nsmall sum of five cents apiece, as<br />\nlong as they hold out. Ben Tappan, who drew the famous \"Glee<br />\nClub Singer,\" was clever enough<br />\nto somewhat disguise the features<br />\nof the member of the Hopkins Glee<br />\nClub that he had in mind while<br />\nmaking the drawing. There is quite<br />\na difference of opinion as to which<br />\nmember of the Club the drawing<br />\nmost resembles. A free copy of<br />\nthe drawing, suitable for framing,<br />\nwill be presented to the reader of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER making the most<br />\nplausible suggestion as to the member of the Club the drawing is<br />\nreally intended to represent.<br />\nContestants' Note\u2014Observe carefully the features of the accompaning reproduction of the \"Glee Club<br />\nSinger\" in the adjoining column,<br />\nand after thinking over the matter<br />\nwrite out the name of the original<br />\nof the drawing and give the reasons for your choice in not more<br />\nthan twenty-five words.
