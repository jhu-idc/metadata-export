The buildings<br />\nwere set on fire and then allowed<br />\nto burn before the eyes of the i<br />\nhabitants. The library was totally destroyed. Louvain will never<br />\nrecover from the effects of wanton destruction, but something is<br />\nbeing done for it, both in the<br />\nUnited States and in England.<br />\nThe movement which is afoot<br />\nhere is being directed by Dr.<br />\nNicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University. The<br />\nNational Committee of the United<br />\nStates for the Restoration of the<br />\nLouvain Library will collect the<br />\nmass of books that are offered by<br />\nthe numerous colleges and univerThese<br />\ns lies of this country.<br />\nbooks, combined with those donated by England, will form the<br />\nnucleus of the library of the University of Louvain. The books<br />\nfrom both countries will be catalogued and presented together.<br />\nThe splendid collection to be<br />\npresented by Johns Hopkins is<br />\nmade up of over two hundred volumes of serial publications that<br />\nhave been bound. Among these<br />\nare the American Chemical Journal, the American Journal of<br />\nMathematics, the American Journal of Philology, Modern Language Notes and Studies of Historical and Political Science. Besides these, the Library Committee will endeavor to influence the<br />\nfaculty to present some of their<br />\nown works.<br />\nAfter the nucleus of the Louvain library is formed, the list of<br />\ngifts given by the universities will<br />\nbe used as a basis of appeal to<br />\nthe general public to do its share<br />\nalso.<br />\nThe Library Committee, as it is<br />\nnow composed, consists of President Frank Goodnow, chairman,<br />\nex officio; Dr. Llewellyn Raney,<br />\nsecretary, ex officio; Professors E.<br />\nB. Mathews, W. W. Willoughby,<br />\nJ. S. Ames and W. P. Mustard.<br />\nDoctors Ames and Mustard were<br />\nrecently appointed to fill the vacancies made by Prof. E. C. Armstrong, who is now at Princeton,<br />\nand by the late Prof. K. F. Smith.<br />\n<br />\nThe second of the Y. M. C. A.'s<br />\nseries of lectures given with the<br />\nidea of helping undergraduates to<br />\nchoose their life work was delivered by Mr. Eugene Levering, at<br />\nthe lunch hour on Tuesday, March<br />\n4. Mr. Levering is the president<br />\nof the National Bank of Commerce<br />\nof Baltimore and one of the trustees of the University.<br />\nAfter speaking of the formation<br />\nof the world's first bank in Italy,<br />\nsome time during the twelfth century, and of the gradual spreading of the institutions up through<br />\nHolland to England and over Europe, Mr. Levering spoke of the<br />\nthree important kinds of banks<br />\nthat were finally evolved and that<br />\nare at present in use. These three<br />\nkinds are: the savings bank, the<br />\ntrust company and the commercial<br />\nbank.<br />\nThe first savings bank was<br />\nformed about a hundred years ago<br />\nby a group of men who saw the<br />\nneed of a bank especially adapted<br />\nto encourage the habit of saving.<br />\nThe savings bank's great functions<br />\nare to help men by helping them<br />\nto save money and to supply long<br />\nterm capital to business. The trust<br />\ncompany's major function, Mr.<br />\nLevering stated, is to develop industrial enterprises, such as the<br />\nrailroads.<br />\nThe commercial banks are divided into two classes: the national bank and the state bank.<br />\nThere are many more state banks<br />\nthan national banks; indeed, the<br />\nratio is almost two to one. The<br />\nstate banks are almost as well<br />\nmanaged now as the national<br />\nbanks. This is brought about by<br />\na method of state inspection corresponding to the Government inspection of national banks. The<br />\nfunction of the commercial bank<br />\nis seen when we consider the wonderful benefit the banks bestow on<br />\nbusiness. A merchant, for instance, receives checks from all<br />\nparts of the country. Does he<br />\nsend men around to all the banks<br />\nupon which the checks are drawn<br />\nto collect his money? Not at all.<br />\nWhat he does is simply to send all<br />\nhis checks to his own bank, which<br />\ncredits him with their amounts.<br />\nThen his bank, through the clearing-house, sends all the checks to<br />\ntheir proper banks. But the greatest benefit commercial banks bestow on business is to supply<br />\nshort-term capital.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Goodnow and Dr. W.<br />\nW. Willoughby, professor of political science at the University,<br />\nwill soon go to Poland to draw<br />\nup a constitution for it, to organize its government and to start it<br />\noperating on a more modern basis. Associated with them in this<br />\nreconstruction work will be Samuel Gompers, of the American<br />\nFederation of Labor, who is now<br />\nabroad; Oscar S. Straus, of New<br />\nYork, former United States Ambassador to Turkey; and Jeremiah<br />\nJenks, a well-known political<br />\neconomist.<br />\nDr. Goodnow has been appointed chairman and Dr. Willoughby<br />\nsecretary of the commission. The<br />\nNational Civic Federation, which<br />\nhad been asked by the leaders of<br />\nPoland to select a commission for<br />\nthe formation of a new government, appointed the delegates. It..<br />\nis understood that the names of<br />\nthese men were submitted to Ignace Jan Paderewski, President<br />\nof Poland, and his associates, and<br />\nthat they unanimously approved<br />\nthem.<br />\nDr. Goodnow is at the present<br />\ntime interested in getting the University running smoothly again<br />\nand in making the readjustments<br />\nthat are necessary after the<br />\nchanges inflicted by the war,<br />\nwhich caused considerable deliberation before accepting the appointment. Dr. Willoughby returned to Baltimore only a short<br />\ntime ago after a year spent in<br />\nChina as a constitutional advisor<br />\nto the Chinese Republic, a position<br />\nin which Dr. Goodnow had pre.<br />\nceded him, and in which Dr. Goodnow spent several years before becoming President of the Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe commission will leave in the<br />\nnext few weeks, and Dr. Goodnow<br />\nand Dr. Willoughby will, in all<br />\nlikelihood, not return before the<br />\nend of the scholastic year.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 1)<br />\n<br />\nThe next meeting of the Round<br />\nTable Group will be held on Thursday night, March 20, from 8 to<br />\n9.30, at 7 West Clay street.

Besides being an inventor of note, Mr. Hartness has been president of the<br />\nAmerican Society of Mechanical<br />\nEngineers, and was spokesman for<br />\na delegation to Europe from that<br />\nsociety in 1913.<br />\nHe stated that the human element is being obscured by the<br />\nspecialization that is coming more<br />\nand more into our industries. The<br />\ntwo great divisions, mental and<br />\nmanual, the executives and the<br />\nworkingmen, must know each<br />\nother, co-operate with each other,<br />\nand promote a fellowship in viewpoint.<br />\nSpecialization, Mr. Harkness<br />\npointed out, does not lead away<br />\nfrom democracy. Anarchy results when men fall away from<br />\nspecialization and co-operation.<br />\nMany of the past failures of our<br />\nnation were due to -the overlooking of this fact. This war was<br />\nwon by an industrial strength<br />\nthat backed up the armies. There<br />\nshould be no antagonism to specialization because of its misuse<br />\nin Prussia; there it was used for<br />\nthe benefit of the inner few.<br />\nIt is the task of the young engineers, said the speaker, to fit<br />\nthemselves for the positions which<br />\nthey can best fill. One characteristic, observed in all of the leaders of industry, is a close understanding of their fellow creatures.<br />\nA great stumbling block to<br />\nmany students is the theory that<br />\na short, intensive course will fit<br />\none for almost any position. Theoretical knowledge must be accompanied by practical experience. Likewise, interest in, and<br />\nappreciation of, labor problems<br />\nwill not necessarily give full understanding of them.<br />\nThe speaker went on to say<br />\nthat intelligent direction can only<br />\nbe obtained by knowing the \"hurl)an element.\" Unqualified officers occasion great economic loss.<br />\nThe manager must know that,<br />\n\u2022young engineers and men of long<br />\ntechnical experience each have<br />\ntheir places, and that a man's<br />\nlanguage is not always ,an insurmountable barrier.

A.'s<br />\nseries of lectures given with the<br />\nidea of helping undergraduates to<br />\nchoose their life work was delivered by Mr. Eugene Levering, at<br />\nthe lunch hour on Tuesday, March<br />\n4. Mr. Levering is the president<br />\nof the National Bank of Commerce<br />\nof Baltimore and one of the trustees of the University.<br />\nAfter speaking of the formation<br />\nof the world's first bank in Italy,<br />\nsome time during the twelfth century, and of the gradual spreading of the institutions up through<br />\nHolland to England and over Europe, Mr. Levering spoke of the<br />\nthree important kinds of banks<br />\nthat were finally evolved and that<br />\nare at present in use. These three<br />\nkinds are: the savings bank, the<br />\ntrust company and the commercial<br />\nbank.<br />\nThe first savings bank was<br />\nformed about a hundred years ago<br />\nby a group of men who saw the<br />\nneed of a bank especially adapted<br />\nto encourage the habit of saving.<br />\nThe savings bank's great functions<br />\nare to help men by helping them<br />\nto save money and to supply long<br />\nterm capital to business. The trust<br />\ncompany's major function, Mr.<br />\nLevering stated, is to develop industrial enterprises, such as the<br />\nrailroads.<br />\nThe commercial banks are divided into two classes: the national bank and the state bank.<br />\nThere are many more state banks<br />\nthan national banks; indeed, the<br />\nratio is almost two to one. The<br />\nstate banks are almost as well<br />\nmanaged now as the national<br />\nbanks. This is brought about by<br />\na method of state inspection corresponding to the Government inspection of national banks. The<br />\nfunction of the commercial bank<br />\nis seen when we consider the wonderful benefit the banks bestow on<br />\nbusiness. A merchant, for instance, receives checks from all<br />\nparts of the country. Does he<br />\nsend men around to all the banks<br />\nupon which the checks are drawn<br />\nto collect his money? Not at all.<br />\nWhat he does is simply to send all<br />\nhis checks to his own bank, which<br />\ncredits him with their amounts.<br />\nThen his bank, through the clearing-house, sends all the checks to<br />\ntheir proper banks. But the greatest benefit commercial banks bestow on business is to supply<br />\nshort-term capital.<br /><br />\nPresident Goodnow and Dr. W.<br />\nW. Willoughby, professor of political science at the University,<br />\nwill soon go to Poland to draw<br />\nup a constitution for it, to organize its government and to start it<br />\noperating on a more modern basis. Associated with them in this<br />\nreconstruction work will be Samuel Gompers, of the American<br />\nFederation of Labor, who is now<br />\nabroad; Oscar S. Straus, of New<br />\nYork, former United States Ambassador to Turkey; and Jeremiah<br />\nJenks, a well-known political<br />\neconomist.<br />\nDr. Goodnow has been appointed chairman and Dr. Willoughby<br />\nsecretary of the commission. The<br />\nNational Civic Federation, which<br />\nhad been asked by the leaders of<br />\nPoland to select a commission for<br />\nthe formation of a new government, appointed the delegates. It..<br />\nis understood that the names of<br />\nthese men were submitted to Ignace Jan Paderewski, President<br />\nof Poland, and his associates, and<br />\nthat they unanimously approved<br />\nthem.<br />\nDr. Goodnow is at the present<br />\ntime interested in getting the University running smoothly again<br />\nand in making the readjustments<br />\nthat are necessary after the<br />\nchanges inflicted by the war,<br />\nwhich caused considerable deliberation before accepting the appointment. Dr. Willoughby returned to Baltimore only a short<br />\ntime ago after a year spent in<br />\nChina as a constitutional advisor<br />\nto the Chinese Republic, a position<br />\nin which Dr. Goodnow had pre.<br />\nceded him, and in which Dr. Goodnow spent several years before becoming President of the Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe commission will leave in the<br />\nnext few weeks, and Dr. Goodnow<br />\nand Dr. Willoughby will, in all<br />\nlikelihood, not return before the<br />\nend of the scholastic year.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 1)<br /><br />\nThe next meeting of the Round<br />\nTable Group will be held on Thursday night, March 20, from 8 to<br />\n9.30, at 7 West Clay street.

Besides being an inventor of note, Mr. Hartness has been president of the<br />\nAmerican Society of Mechanical<br />\nEngineers, and was spokesman for<br />\na delegation to Europe from that<br />\nsociety in 1913.<br />\nHe stated that the human element is being obscured by the<br />\nspecialization that is coming more<br />\nand more into our industries. The<br />\ntwo great divisions, mental and<br />\nmanual, the executives and the<br />\nworkingmen, must know each<br />\nother, co-operate with each other,<br />\nand promote a fellowship in viewpoint.<br />\nSpecialization, Mr. Harkness<br />\npointed out, does not lead away<br />\nfrom democracy. Anarchy results when men fall away from<br />\nspecialization and co-operation.<br />\nMany of the past failures of our<br />\nnation were due to -the overlooking of this fact. This war was<br />\nwon by an industrial strength<br />\nthat backed up the armies. There<br />\nshould be no antagonism to specialization because of its misuse<br />\nin Prussia; there it was used for<br />\nthe benefit of the inner few.<br />\nIt is the task of the young engineers, said the speaker, to fit<br />\nthemselves for the positions which<br />\nthey can best fill. One characteristic, observed in all of the leaders of industry, is a close understanding of their fellow creatures.<br />\nA great stumbling block to<br />\nmany students is the theory that<br />\na short, intensive course will fit<br />\none for almost any position. Theoretical knowledge must be accompanied by practical experience. Likewise, interest in, and<br />\nappreciation of, labor problems<br />\nwill not necessarily give full understanding of them.<br />\nThe speaker went on to say<br />\nthat intelligent direction can only<br />\nbe obtained by knowing the \"hurl)an element.\" Unqualified officers occasion great economic loss.<br />\nThe manager must know that,<br />\n\u2022young engineers and men of long<br />\ntechnical experience each have<br />\ntheir places, and that a man's<br />\nlanguage is not always ,an insurmountable barrier.
