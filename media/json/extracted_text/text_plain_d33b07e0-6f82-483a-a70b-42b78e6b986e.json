Calvert St., Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 9, 1926;<br />\n<br />\nTHE AUTOCRAT<br />\nOur soul is filled with misery, our mind is filled with questionings. Is it possible that one cannot criticize the campus<br />\npowers, cannot offer suggestions to the Student Council?<br />\nSeveral weeks ago the columns of this paper were filled<br />\nivith much jabbering, about \u2022the burning issue. ,of unlimited<br />\ncuts. in a moment of forgetfulness we suggested that the<br />\nStudent Council act one way or the other on the question.<br />\nLo and behold, 3Ir. Alger Hiss, President of the Student Council, writes .to the editor, telling him that his personal opinion<br />\nShould have no consideration\u2014(even in a small suggestion)\u2014<br />\nthat in order to bring the matter before the Council one of the<br />\n'classes would just have to instruct its delegates to that effect.<br />\nNow the editor of the NEWS-LETTER admittedly has no<br />\nvoiee in campus affairs. But, dropping the mantel of office,<br />\nettnnot any individual offer suggestions? Will the Student<br />\nCouncil refuse to act upon them unless the classes first endorse the suggestion?<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIt seems to us that any student should have, as a matter<br />\nof course, the right to make suggestions to the governing body<br />\nwithout the necessity of a formal class vote. Then, naturally,<br />\nthe Council could approve or'drop the suggestion; but it should<br />\n\u2022 give it consideration first.<br />\nThis outburst is not in defense of our little idea; it seems.<br />\nto us that the Council is establishing a dangerous precedent;<br />\nfollowed to its logical conclusion it would establish a campus<br />\nautocrat:\u2014so we protest.<br />\n<br />\nA GOOD MOVE<br />\nAfter the recent demise of anothe&r of the useless campus<br />\norganizations comes the even more cheerful news that a really<br />\n\u2022 worthwhile club is being planned.<br />\nThe proposed activities club, suggested no doubt by the<br />\nAthletic Varsity Club, meets the traditional and ancestral '\"long<br />\n'felt need on the campus.\" The plan seems to have everything<br />\n-in its favor and nothing against it. Such an organization without the annoyances of dues and frequent meetings at set intervals, would nevertheless have, a most helpful influence on the<br />\ncampus non-athletic activities.<br />\nWe may be unduly optimistic, but an activities club, in'<br />\n\u2022 um- opinion, would be the best rallying point of Alumni interest<br />\nand support yet devised. The class is at best unwieldly as any<br />\nalumni unit, with a few outstanding men and with the rank and<br />\nfile bound by no significant common interest. But men who<br />\nhave risen to leadership in campus activities will form a very<br />\ndifferent body. A man will not soon forget an activity to<br />\nwhich he has devoted four years of work, nor w,ill he soon lose<br />\ninterest in the scene of his activities, the campus. A club of<br />\nthese men would not need the stimulus'of an elaborate organ/ation.or of a present definite aim. The interest and comrad-\u2022<br />\n,hip which already exist will hold it together much more effectively. And these men, while grouped around the festive board,<br />\n,could, in the intervals between their reminisences of the old<br />\n.days, give some pretty good suggestions to undergraduate activities.<br />\nThe plan for such a club seems sound from the ground up;<br />\n\u2018the NEWS-LETTER favors it.<br />\nJ.

He then,<br />\n\"to make a short cut,\" took an<br />\nillustration from the science of<br />\nmathematics, and one from grammar.

At this third dimension only, he stated, was he willing to put a period, for it rounded out the definition of man.<br />\n\"If your education is neglected<br />\nin the third dimension,\" concluded<br />\nMr. Wilson, -it is your loss and<br />\nthe world is cheated also, and it<br />\nis this phase that is being neglected.

Is it possible that one cannot criticize the campus<br />\npowers, cannot offer suggestions to the Student Council?<br />\nSeveral weeks ago the columns of this paper were filled<br />\nivith much jabbering, about \u2022the burning issue. ,of unlimited<br />\ncuts. in a moment of forgetfulness we suggested that the<br />\nStudent Council act one way or the other on the question.<br />\nLo and behold, 3Ir. Alger Hiss, President of the Student Council, writes .to the editor, telling him that his personal opinion<br />\nShould have no consideration\u2014(even in a small suggestion)\u2014<br />\nthat in order to bring the matter before the Council one of the<br />\n'classes would just have to instruct its delegates to that effect.<br />\nNow the editor of the NEWS-LETTER admittedly has no<br />\nvoiee in campus affairs. But, dropping the mantel of office,<br />\nettnnot any individual offer suggestions? Will the Student<br />\nCouncil refuse to act upon them unless the classes first endorse the suggestion?<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIt seems to us that any student should have, as a matter<br />\nof course, the right to make suggestions to the governing body<br />\nwithout the necessity of a formal class vote. Then, naturally,<br />\nthe Council could approve or'drop the suggestion; but it should<br />\n\u2022 give it consideration first.<br />\nThis outburst is not in defense of our little idea; it seems.<br />\nto us that the Council is establishing a dangerous precedent;<br />\nfollowed to its logical conclusion it would establish a campus<br />\nautocrat:\u2014so we protest.<br /><br />\nA GOOD MOVE<br />\nAfter the recent demise of anothe&amp;r of the useless campus<br />\norganizations comes the even more cheerful news that a really<br />\n\u2022 worthwhile club is being planned.<br />\nThe proposed activities club, suggested no doubt by the<br />\nAthletic Varsity Club, meets the traditional and ancestral '\"long<br />\n'felt need on the campus.\" The plan seems to have everything<br />\n-in its favor and nothing against it. Such an organization without the annoyances of dues and frequent meetings at set intervals, would nevertheless have, a most helpful influence on the<br />\ncampus non-athletic activities.<br />\nWe may be unduly optimistic, but an activities club, in'<br />\n\u2022 um- opinion, would be the best rallying point of Alumni interest<br />\nand support yet devised. The class is at best unwieldly as any<br />\nalumni unit, with a few outstanding men and with the rank and<br />\nfile bound by no significant common interest. But men who<br />\nhave risen to leadership in campus activities will form a very<br />\ndifferent body. A man will not soon forget an activity to<br />\nwhich he has devoted four years of work, nor w,ill he soon lose<br />\ninterest in the scene of his activities, the campus. A club of<br />\nthese men would not need the stimulus'of an elaborate organ/ation.or of a present definite aim. The interest and comrad-\u2022<br />\n,hip which already exist will hold it together much more effectively. And these men, while grouped around the festive board,<br />\n,could, in the intervals between their reminisences of the old<br />\n.days, give some pretty good suggestions to undergraduate activities.<br />\nThe plan for such a club seems sound from the ground up;<br />\n\u2018the NEWS-LETTER favors it.<br />\nJ.
