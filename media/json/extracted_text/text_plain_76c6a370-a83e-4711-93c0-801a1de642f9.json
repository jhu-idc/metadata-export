And when<br />\nsome two or three hundred fighting students are tightly bunched<br />\naround the few .men in direct contl:ct with the banner it is not unreasonable to suppose that serious casualties may result. In<br />\nfact, when once a man is thrown<br />\nto the ground in the midst of the<br />\nstruggling mass of fresinnen and<br />\nsophomores, he is indeed lucky<br />\nto be-able to rise before his arms,<br />\nlegs,.face and sundry other portions of his anatomy have been<br />\nnone too gently trod- upon by the<br />\nsurrounding combatants.<br />\nBut to abolish the traditional<br />\nrush would be to destroy one of<br />\nthe oldest of University customs.<br />\nMy plan is merely to change the<br />\nnature of the rush and to so make<br />\ntime contest much safer and considerably more fair, and at the<br />\nsame time detract in no way from<br />\nits proper roughness. I suggest<br />\nthat this system, which is used<br />\nat a limber of large colleges, be<br />\nadopted at Hopkins: A large field<br />\n\u2014about the size and shape of a<br />\nfootball gridiron, for instance\u2014<br />\nis marked with definite boundary<br />\nlines. Time contesting classes line<br />\nup at opposite ends of the field<br />\nand, at the signal, rush toward<br />\neach other. The object, then, is to<br />\nthrow all the opposing class' men<br />\n,out of the field boundaries. The<br />\nclass which accomplishes this is<br />\nclearly the winner; there can thus<br />\nbe no disputes about both classes<br />\npossessing parts of the banner or<br />\nabout the banner's being captured<br />\nafter the final whistle, and so on.<br />\nThe method of branding the men<br />\nwho have been thrown off the field<br />\nand who are therefore ineligible<br />\nfor further fighting, is to neatly<br />\ncoat them with green water-color<br />\npaint. This sort of a rush, I believe, gives each man a chance to<br />\nbe definitely useful in bringing<br />\nvictory to his class. According to<br />\nthe present style of rushes at<br />\nHopkins, more than three-fourths<br />\nof the men do not even get a<br />\n<br />\nthis way the opinion of academic<br />\ncircles throughout the country<br />\nwill be procured. The results will<br />\nbe wired to the committee in New<br />\nYork, and from there will be published as soon as possible. The<br />\nlocal results will be made known<br />\nthe following day.<br />\nThe following is an extract from<br />\na letter to the Editor of THE<br />\n<br />\nNEW S-LETTER:<br />\n\"Experience shows that relatively a small number of people<br />\nhave even read the League of<br />\nNations part of the Peace Treaty,<br />\nlet alone the Treaty as a whole.<br />\nEveryone must agree that it is<br />\nof supreme importance that this<br />\nissue be intelligently discussed by<br />\nthe whole American .public. In<br />\nno centers should .this discussion<br />\nbe more fruitful or valuable than<br />\nin the academic communities. It<br />\nis, therefore, very much to be<br />\nhoped that the utmost discussion<br />\nwill be stimulated,that the student<br />\nbody will'be encouraged to study<br />\nthe matter, to debate it and to<br />\ntalk it over with their friends and<br />\nfamilies at home during the<br />\nChristmas holidays. Then when<br />\nthe academic body reassembles after the holidays, plans should be<br />\nmade to take the vote in a way<br />\nwhich will secure as neftrly as<br />\npossible a complete representation<br />\nof the faculty, on one hand, and<br />\nthe student body on the other.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe action of the leading colleges in organizing a referendum<br />\non the Peace Treaty among the<br />\nstudents of all the universities<br />\nand colleges in the country, deserves a great deal of attention.<br />\nSince Congress completely failed<br />\nto reach a definite decision and<br />\nmerely \"passed the buck\" in regard to the Peace Treaty, it is<br />\nup to the individual citizens in<br />\nthis country to express their<br />\nopinion.<br />\nWe college students, from whom<br />\nthe future professional and business men of the country will for<br />\nthe most part be drawn, should<br />\nAn \"IF\" for Contribs.<br />\nhave a particularly large share in If you can sling a line like J.

The greater part<br />\nof these values are those created<br />\nin land, in the form of unearned<br />\nincrement and economic rent.

It<br />\nis not fair to tax the improvements<br />\nthat cause the land about them<br />\nto increase in value, but the land<br />\nwhose value is increased should<br />\nbe taxed on the basis of its increased value. It should be taxed<br />\nirrespective of the improvements<br />\nupon it.

(2) It is certain, land<br />\nis not easily concealed, but personal property is. (3) It is equal<br />\nfor all, in that each pays according to what lie gets from the corntriunity.

The plan of having but one<br />\nreal point of attack for the sophomores to concentrate upon\u2014namely, the freshman holding the banner\u2014naturally enough causes the<br />\nparticipants to criwd into the<br />\nsmallest possible area. And when<br />\nsome two or three hundred fighting students are tightly bunched<br />\naround the few .men in direct contl:ct with the banner it is not unreasonable to suppose that serious casualties may result. In<br />\nfact, when once a man is thrown<br />\nto the ground in the midst of the<br />\nstruggling mass of fresinnen and<br />\nsophomores, he is indeed lucky<br />\nto be-able to rise before his arms,<br />\nlegs,.face and sundry other portions of his anatomy have been<br />\nnone too gently trod- upon by the<br />\nsurrounding combatants.<br />\nBut to abolish the traditional<br />\nrush would be to destroy one of<br />\nthe oldest of University customs.<br />\nMy plan is merely to change the<br />\nnature of the rush and to so make<br />\ntime contest much safer and considerably more fair, and at the<br />\nsame time detract in no way from<br />\nits proper roughness. I suggest<br />\nthat this system, which is used<br />\nat a limber of large colleges, be<br />\nadopted at Hopkins: A large field<br />\n\u2014about the size and shape of a<br />\nfootball gridiron, for instance\u2014<br />\nis marked with definite boundary<br />\nlines. Time contesting classes line<br />\nup at opposite ends of the field<br />\nand, at the signal, rush toward<br />\neach other. The object, then, is to<br />\nthrow all the opposing class' men<br />\n,out of the field boundaries. The<br />\nclass which accomplishes this is<br />\nclearly the winner; there can thus<br />\nbe no disputes about both classes<br />\npossessing parts of the banner or<br />\nabout the banner's being captured<br />\nafter the final whistle, and so on.<br />\nThe method of branding the men<br />\nwho have been thrown off the field<br />\nand who are therefore ineligible<br />\nfor further fighting, is to neatly<br />\ncoat them with green water-color<br />\npaint. This sort of a rush, I believe, gives each man a chance to<br />\nbe definitely useful in bringing<br />\nvictory to his class. According to<br />\nthe present style of rushes at<br />\nHopkins, more than three-fourths<br />\nof the men do not even get a<br /><br />\nthis way the opinion of academic<br />\ncircles throughout the country<br />\nwill be procured. The results will<br />\nbe wired to the committee in New<br />\nYork, and from there will be published as soon as possible. The<br />\nlocal results will be made known<br />\nthe following day.<br />\nThe following is an extract from<br />\na letter to the Editor of THE<br /><br />\nNEW S-LETTER:<br />\n\"Experience shows that relatively a small number of people<br />\nhave even read the League of<br />\nNations part of the Peace Treaty,<br />\nlet alone the Treaty as a whole.<br />\nEveryone must agree that it is<br />\nof supreme importance that this<br />\nissue be intelligently discussed by<br />\nthe whole American .public. In<br />\nno centers should .this discussion<br />\nbe more fruitful or valuable than<br />\nin the academic communities. It<br />\nis, therefore, very much to be<br />\nhoped that the utmost discussion<br />\nwill be stimulated,that the student<br />\nbody will'be encouraged to study<br />\nthe matter, to debate it and to<br />\ntalk it over with their friends and<br />\nfamilies at home during the<br />\nChristmas holidays. Then when<br />\nthe academic body reassembles after the holidays, plans should be<br />\nmade to take the vote in a way<br />\nwhich will secure as neftrly as<br />\npossible a complete representation<br />\nof the faculty, on one hand, and<br />\nthe student body on the other.\"<br /><br />\nThe action of the leading colleges in organizing a referendum<br />\non the Peace Treaty among the<br />\nstudents of all the universities<br />\nand colleges in the country, deserves a great deal of attention.<br />\nSince Congress completely failed<br />\nto reach a definite decision and<br />\nmerely \"passed the buck\" in regard to the Peace Treaty, it is<br />\nup to the individual citizens in<br />\nthis country to express their<br />\nopinion.<br />\nWe college students, from whom<br />\nthe future professional and business men of the country will for<br />\nthe most part be drawn, should<br />\nAn \"IF\" for Contribs.<br />\nhave a particularly large share in If you can sling a line like J.

The greater part<br />\nof these values are those created<br />\nin land, in the form of unearned<br />\nincrement and economic rent.
