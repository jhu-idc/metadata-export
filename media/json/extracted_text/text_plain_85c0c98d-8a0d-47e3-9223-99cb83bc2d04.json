Coordinating less<br />\nrecognized events such as the<br />\nparents program and Moving-In<br />\nDay required a tremendous<br />\namount of work, she said, adding<br />\nthat the amount of effort and<br />\norganization that went :nto<br />\nintegrating commuting and<br />\n<br />\ntransfer students into the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity should be noted.<br />\n\"Without the success of these<br />\nprograms, Orientation simply<br />\nwould not have been the overall<br />\nsuccess that it was,\" stressed<br />\nStolis.<br />\nShe noted that Orientation is<br />\nbasically the same every year,<br />\nand that the complexity of the<br />\nprogram leaves no room for<br />\nmajor, radical changes.<br />\nStill, this year's Orientation<br />\ngroup worked very hard to<br />\nstreamline the program without<br />\ntaking anything away.<br />\nThe goal of this year's group<br />\nwas to increase the benefits<br />\nOrientation had to offer. Student<br />\nadvising training was more<br />\nfocused, entertainment was<br />\nbroadened to enhance its appeal<br />\nto everyone, and more activities<br />\nwere planned for transfer and<br />\ncommuting students.<br />\nThe success of this year's<br />\nOrientation program can be<br />\nattributed to a number of factors.<br />\nThe popular reason, mentioned<br />\nand<br />\nfreshmen<br />\nboth<br />\nby<br />\nupperclassmen, is entertainment.<br />\nThe diversity of activities,<br />\nranging from coffeehouses to Top<br />\n40 bands to progressive bands,<br />\nwas a \u2022 key to the freshmen's<br />\noverall enjoyment of the<br />\n<br />\nJohn Wee<br />\n<br />\nThe Orientation chairs take time out (what little they claimed they had).

Stolis said most<br />\nconsidered events such as P.T.<br />\nFlagg's Night and the Harbor<br />\nCruise to be the best opportunities<br />\nfor<br />\nfreshmen<br />\nto<br />\nmeet<br />\nupperclassmen, a prime function<br />\nof Orientation.<br />\nAnother reason for the<br />\nprogram's success was the<br />\nincreased importance placed on<br />\nstudent advisors, especially group<br />\nleaders.<br />\nIn years past, a group leader<br />\nwas a figurehead, with no real<br />\npurpose beyond that of being a<br />\nstudent advisor. This year, the<br />\ngroup leaders were asked to<br />\nmaintain more contact with all<br />\nfreshmen in a group. They were<br />\nexpected to propose activities for<br />\n<br />\nthe group as a whole, in an effort Orientation. We expect them to<br />\nto expand the base of support continue this contact through the<br />\navailable to freshmen.<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nDianna DeVore, student<br />\nStolis added, \"If we keep on<br />\nco-chairperson, top of the group leaders this will<br />\nadvising<br />\nattributed some of the success of help to keep Orientation going all<br />\nthis year's Orientation program to year.\"<br />\nthe strong group leaders,<br />\nDespite the success of<br />\nmentioning, \"Because the groups Orientation, said Stolis, details<br />\nwere so strong, Orientation should be improved.

This year,<br />\nbefore a packed Shriver Hall audience,<br />\nMuller used his speech to advise freshmen<br />\nof their role at Homewood and to encourage the development of diverse relationships and a sense of community.<br />\nAfter Orientation '88 Chairwoman Ellen<br />\nStolis completed her opening remarks, in<br />\nwhich she urged freshmen to look for<br />\npositives at Hopkins and become involved in activities, Muller took to the<br />\nmicrophone.

We chose you because we believe in<br />\nyou.\"<br />\nOne thing freshmen will feel, said<br />\nMuller, is a sense of self-renewal. He said<br />\nHopkins allows students far greater<br />\nfreedom than most other American universities and that students should seek help<br />\nif they feel uncomfortable or confused.<br />\n\"You're not used to the fact that you've<br />\nbeen set free in ways that you've not been<br />\nbefore,\" said the president. \"How you<br />\nspend your time, what you choose to do,<br />\nis up to you.

If you need help, there's always going to be help for you, but you'll have to<br />\nask for it.\"<br />\nMuller turned to the role of freshmen at<br />\nHopkins, saying that the Class of 1992 will<br />\nset the tone for the campus, primarily<br />\nbecause it is the only class living<br />\npredominantly on campus.<br />\nHe offered the class a challenge.<br />\n\"You're all very bright, but in social terms<br />\nyou have the opportunity to make friends<br />\nwith people very different from you,\" said<br />\nMuller. \"The risk is if you're going to<br />\nseek people who are most like you most<br />\nof the time.\" The question, said Muller,<br />\nis, whether freshmen will forge a community or break down into \"subcommunities.\"<br />\nEach incoming class, said Muller,<br />\nrepresents a twenty-five percent change in<br />\nthe undergraduate make-up and has the<br />\npotential for giving Hopkins a \"warm and<br />\ngracious and civilized atmosphere\" or<br />\nmaking it a \"cold, mean, and selfish<br />\nplace.\"<br />\nIn pushing the need for mutual and selfrespect, Muller drew upon the story of<br />\nLawrence Taylor.

Dr.<br />\nSlawecki had served as<br />\nAmerican co-director since<br />\n1986.

The number of Chinese<br />\nstudents is expected to stay<br />\nabout the same at 40.<br />\n'The increase in quantity on<br />\nthe American side is matched<br />\nby an increase in the general<br />\nlevel of preparation,' said Dr.<br />\nSpeidel, himself an authority in<br />\nChinese studies who travels nationally and internationally on<br />\nbehalf of the Center.<br />\n\"The curriculum is not<br />\nchanging substantially, but I am<br />\n<br />\nvery pleased that the Chinese<br />\nlanguage ability of the<br />\nAmerican students will be considerably higher that it has been<br />\nfor the previous two years,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"Also, we have a larger<br />\ngroup of American students this<br />\nyear.

The new parking plan will help defray the costs<br />\nof maintaining and expanding the<br />\ncurrent parking system.<br />\nOn-site parking manager Floyd<br />\nStanley said he foresees no problems with the switch to the new<br />\nsystem. Beginning Monday, October 3, a wooden gate will bar<br />\nany unregistered driver without a<br />\ncard from parking on campus, except at the visitor's lot next to<br />\nGarland or at metered spaces.<br />\nEvery driver will pass through<br />\nthe gate twice each time he or she<br />\nuses parking, once on entry and<br />\nonce on exit from the lot. This<br />\nwill prevent multiple drivers from<br />\nusing the same card to enter a<br />\nparking lot. The card's history,<br />\nwhen and where it was used, is<br />\nrecorded both on the access<br />\ncard's infrared coded bar and in<br />\nthe central computer at the parking office.<br />\nWith the switch to paid parking, responsibility for operating<br />\nthe parking system shifts from<br />\ncampus security to Broadway<br />\nServices Inc., a division of the<br />\ncorporate branch of Hopkins. BSI<br />\nregisters drivers, collects all fees,<br />\nand operates the access gates. Its<br />\noffice on campus is at Shriver 16.<br />\nCampus security officers,<br />\nhowever, will still issue parking<br />\ntickets. Security, not BSI, is<br />\nresponsible for enforcing all<br />\nparking regulations.<br />\nStudents wishing to obtain<br />\n<br />\nparking permits have two<br />\nchoices. The flat rate of $10 per<br />\nmonth, paid at the start of the<br />\nsemester, buys an unlimited access card allowing use of all parking spaces not specifically<br />\ndesignated for faculty. Limited<br />\naccess cards, valid for one year<br />\nafte/. purchase, allow five, ten,<br />\nfifteen, or twenty visits at a cost<br />\nof $1.75 per increment of five.<br />\nAn alternative is to use the<br />\nvisitor's section of the Garland<br />\n<br />\ntheir traditional meeting places.\"<br />\n\"While there are many rules\"<br />\nsaid Sokolowski, \"the codes are<br />\nbroadly and clearly defined.\"<br />\nThe penalties incurred by Pi<br />\nLambda Phi's breach of the rules<br />\ninclude a semester-long probationary period during which any<br />\nreasonable complaint against the<br />\nfraternity would result in harsher<br />\npenalties.

A respected, experienced Hopkins administrator fills<br />\nthe position left open by an equally<br />\nregarded departing administrator. The<br />\nonly problem is that the position, despite<br />\nthe apparent consistency of title, was<br />\nchanged in the interim by the administration. Changed, to our minds,<br />\nfor the worse.<br />\nFirst, a little background. The position of Dean of Homewood Schools Services was created with the arrival of<br />\nWelch in 1985. Its creation was an attempt to restructure ,and thereby<br />\nstreamline the administration. While<br />\nacademic departments and academic<br />\nauxilary services would continue to<br />\nreport to the two academic deans, the<br />\npreviously scattered non-academic aux,ilary services, including financial aid,<br />\nstudent activities, and housing would<br />\nreport to this new dean. This, in particular, would free up some of the<br />\nacademic deans' time, enabling them to<br />\nconcentrate more fully on academic<br />\naffairs.<br />\nSignificantly also, the restructuring<br />\nrecognized the crucial importance of<br />\nstudent services at Homewood. While<br />\nWelch (read: student services) had to<br />\nnegotiate program funding with the<br />\nacademic deans, he acted independently of them once the budget was settled.<br />\nFurther, Welch reported directly to the<br />\nprovost, John Lombardi. The independence and the direct line to Lombardi combined with the centralization<br />\nof student services gave it more attention and funding than ever before. And<br />\ncertainly the improvements enacted during Welch's tenure, especially the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force Report,<br />\nspeak for themselves.<br />\nThe problem is that with Welch's<br />\ndeparture, the administration saw fit to<br />\n<br />\nalter the position. Under their plan Colombo reports directly to the academic<br />\ndeans on all matters, budgetary and<br />\notherwise. Their decision prompted Student Council to form an ad hoc committee last Spring aimed at addressing what<br />\nthey (and we)saw as a downgrading of<br />\nthe dean's position, and subsequently,<br />\nof student services. Under the direct<br />\njurisdiction of the academic deans, student services might be sacrificed to the<br />\nneeds of the academic departments.<br />\nBoth Lombardi and University President Steven Muller say we shouldn't<br />\nnotice any significant change in the way<br />\nstudent services are handled under the<br />\nnew system.<br />\nBut we agree with Council's concerns, and here's why:<br />\nFirst, the allocation of money to student services without allowing fiscal<br />\nautonomy is relegating them to a less<br />\nadvantageous spot on the budget<br />\nledger\u2014student services are that much<br />\nfurther from getting the attention they<br />\ndeserve.<br />\nFurther, we ask how academic deans<br />\ncould possibly give sufficient attention<br />\nto vital student services given Arts and<br />\nSciences' present million dollar budget<br />\ndeficit. The reason Welch's position<br />\nwas initially created was because the<br />\ndeans couldn't handle both effectively.<br />\nIt appears then that the efficacy of this<br />\ndeanship rests to a large extent on personality and initiative\u2014disturbingly so.<br />\nWhile we have no reason to believe that<br />\nColombo can't swim with the sharks,<br />\nas it were, why should the position rely<br />\nheavily on such a variable factor as<br />\ndisposition?<br />\nThe grim reality at this point is exactly that it does, however. Muller<br />\nassures undergraduates that the situation<br />\nwill be carefully monitored for any<br />\npossible adverse affects upon student<br />\nservices. It is in our best interest to do<br />\nthe same: we can't afford to be lost in<br />\nthe scramble when the scarce resources<br />\nare allotted.<br />\n<br />\nThe News..Letter would<br />\nlike to heartily thank<br />\nDr. Susan Boswell<br />\nfor all her patience, support, and perserverance in<br />\nachieving the renaissance<br />\nof the Gatehouse after our<br />\ndisastrous summer<br />\n<br />\nPseudoperspicacity<br />\nJonathan Engler<br />\nNear the end of my sophomore<br />\nyear I had a dream which I can<br />\nonly attribute to delayed trauma<br />\nfrom freshman year. I dreamt I<br />\nwas sitting in Mudd Hall, in those<br />\nincredibly comfortable, sleepworthy seats when I realized that<br />\nI was in the completely wrong<br />\nroom. But the doors were locked<br />\nand there was no escape. For<br />\nsome reason, in the sort of progression of events that only make<br />\nsense in dreams, I was soon up<br />\non the lectern insulting all of the<br />\nprofessors and TA's that I had in<br />\ntwo years of Johns Hopkins. As<br />\nI stood there, these very professors and TA's began walking<br />\ntowards me from the audience<br />\nlike something from the Night of<br />\nthe Living Dead, wielding pitchforks. I awoke in a cold sweat.<br />\nPitchforks aside, this was a<br />\npretty realistic dream in some<br />\nways. Hopkins upperclassmen,<br />\nhaving been here for several<br />\nyears, often still have no idea<br />\nwhere many of the buildings on<br />\nthis campus are. Particularly<br />\nWriting Seminars majors, who<br />\nnever leave the basement of<br />\nGilman. So for you freshmen<br />\nwho sheepishly find yourselves in<br />\nOrganic Chemistry when what<br />\nyou really want is Occidental<br />\nCivilization, don't worry about it.<br />\nThose arrogant upperclassmen do<br />\nit all the time. I ran into a senior<br />\nfriend of mine this week who sat<br />\nthrough an intermediate Spanish<br />\nclass for forty minues until she<br />\n<br />\nrealized that it wasn't Italian<br />\nElements. Embarrassed? No<br />\nway. \"The TA was Italian looking, so I thought 'This must be it.'<br />\nOh well.\"<br />\nIndeed, it is almost a sport to<br />\ndirect lost foreign graduate<br />\nstudents to Mergenthaler Hall<br />\nwhen they ask for, say, Ames.<br />\nIt's not that Homewood students<br />\nare malicious. They just have no<br />\nidea where buildings are that<br />\ndon't correspond to their major.<br />\nAnd no-one wants to look like a<br />\nknow-nothing freshman.<br />\nBut if you ask anyone, from<br />\nSteve Muller on down, where the<br />\nStudent Union is, they will look<br />\nat you strangely. Student...what?<br />\nMore likely than not, you will<br />\nfind yourself at Levering Hall,<br />\nthat home of periodic HOP events<br />\nand prowling graduate students<br />\nlooking for a place to sleep.<br />\nSpontaneous socializing here<br />\npeaks with the afternoon soap<br />\noperas blaring from a color<br />\ntelevision.<br />\nAs a freshman, the student<br />\nunion situation does not seem<br />\nespecially pressing. The dormitories are about as social as<br />\nthose at any university.

Two of them were<br />\nhistory professors, and they explained the role women and<br />\nminorities had in the history they<br />\nwere teaching and how this came<br />\nto be ignored, through the crippling mechanism of male<br />\ndominance in the teaching of<br />\nhistory. One was an English profesor, and of all the Canterbury<br />\nTales, the one he chose for us to<br />\nread was that of the Wife of Bath,<br />\nthe feminist. Whether or not these<br />\ndecisions were made in conscious<br />\nresponse to campus concerns,<br />\nthey offer themselves as signs of<br />\n<br />\nhope for all students, that ar- mg at Hopkins remember the<br />\ntificial limits will not be placed on student-run WJHU.

Its<br />\nGeorgian style architecture was<br />\nfirst built in 1921 for Maryland<br />\nCasualty. It was reconstructed in<br />\n1971 and is at the present time<br />\nundergoing further renovations.<br />\nWithin the Rotunda are a<br />\nnumber of stores of concern to<br />\nthe discriminating college student. Of paramount importance is<br />\nthe Giant Foods supermarket,<br />\nwhich has the best selection of all<br />\nthe food stores in the area and is<br />\nopen twenty-four hours a day,<br />\nseven days a week (except Sunday, when it closes at 11 pm and<br />\nreopens at seven the following<br />\nmorning). Although the prices<br />\n<br />\nmay not be the best, they have<br />\ngreat sales weekly, double<br />\ncoupons, and inexpensive but<br />\nhigh-quality store brands.<br />\nThe Rotunda's record store,<br />\nRecordmasters, does a good job<br />\nat keeping a complete stock of all<br />\nvarieties of music. In fact, they<br />\nrun two stores, one across from<br />\nthe other. One sells only classical<br />\nmusic and the other modern<br />\nmusic. They have a large selection of compact discs at fairly low<br />\nprices, and they rent movies and<br />\nVCR's.<br />\nThe Rotunda Cinema I and II<br />\ncannot support a large number of<br />\nmovies at any one time, but they<br />\nchange features frequently, and<br />\ntheir movies are usually very current. They have a three dollar<br />\nmatinee before 6 pm during the<br />\nweek, and then the price jumps to<br />\nthe usual rate for a movie in<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, five dollars. Student<br />\ndiscounts are available Monday<br />\nthrough Thursday. On holidays<br />\nand weekends only the first showing is at matinee prices. Call<br />\n235-1800 for more information<br />\nabout current movies.<br />\nAlthough the Rotunda is probably the only mall in the state<br />\nthat doesn't have a food court,<br />\nthere are a few places to eat.

Sadly for those<br />\nstudents addicted to the notion of<br />\nimbibing freely throughout college, such is not to be at Hopkins.<br />\nSince the State of Maryland raised its drinking age from 18 to 21<br />\nin 1982, the Johns Hopkins campus has been, for all intents and<br />\npurposes, \"dry.\" Simply put,<br />\nMaryland law prohibits the<br />\npossession or consumption of<br />\nalcoholic beverages by people<br />\nunder the age of 2I\u2014a law which<br />\nobviously affects a majority of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe ramifications of such a law<br />\nextend into all areas of campus<br />\nlife\u2014certainly there are restrictions on HOP events. (Hopkins<br />\nOrganization for Programming)<br />\nand other campus groups. But<br />\nperhaps the law poses the most<br />\n<br />\nunique difficulties for students sequestered in the dormitories, who<br />\nmay feel constrained both by the<br />\narms of the State of Maryland and<br />\nadministrators<br />\nuniversity<br />\nreaching into their private living<br />\nareas. Is there no justice?<br />\nUnfortunately, the law is the<br />\nlaw and not even Hopkins<br />\nstudents are above it. The University role in enforcing that law is<br />\nfairly clear. According to Andrea<br />\nPerry, Director of Residential<br />\nLife, \"The University has an<br />\nobligation to have its residents<br />\nunderstand the law...they are<br />\nresponsible for their own<br />\nbehavior. Further, we have a<br />\nresponsibility to police consumption and possession of alcohol<br />\nin public. We will confiscate<br />\nalcohol<br />\nHowever, Perry continued,<br />\n\"We feel students have a right to<br />\nprivacy.

Every week in the City<br />\nPaper there are pages upon pages<br />\nof events listed, and although<br />\nmany of these require transportation out of the city or a valid<br />\ndriver's license with a birthdate<br />\nof 1967 or earlier, there are still<br />\nplenty of things left to do.<br />\nKeep an eye out for the ethnic<br />\nfestivals\u2014although they are mostly an excuse for selling ethnic<br />\nfood, they do generally have free<br />\nentertainment, and the food<br />\nusually is good. Special organizations also hold events, such as the<br />\nrecently-past Feline Fest in the<br />\nFestival Hall at the Inner Harbor.<br />\n<br />\nFells Point is also a good place to<br />\ncatch a neighborhood festival.<br />\nBaltimore's night life has been<br />\nimproving now for some time.<br />\nFor the under-21 set, many night<br />\nspots, such as P.T.

Several famous<br />\nrestaurants specializing in Indian<br />\n(Tandoor), Grecian (Taverna<br />\nAthena), and seafood (Mariner's<br />\nPier One) dishes are located inside the two-level building.

It is<br />\nthe area to where most upperclassmen flock, after being<br />\nthrown out of their dormitory<br />\nnests.<br />\nEating and drinking in Charles<br />\nVillage can be limited, but it can<br />\nalso be good. There's a range of<br />\naffordable food, from pizza to<br />\nThai. Below is a partial list of the<br />\navailable restaurants, but it is also<br />\nrecommended that you explore<br />\nwhatever else you can find.<br />\nP.J.'s Pub<br />\n(3333 N. Charles St., 243-8844):<br />\nLocated on Charles between<br />\n33rd and 34th Streets in the basement of The Charles apartment<br />\nbuilding. Pizza and beer are the<br />\nmain attractions. It has been listed<br />\nin the City Paper's Best of<br />\nBaltimore issue for many years as<br />\nhaving the best assortment of<br />\ndraft beer. It has great deals on<br />\ndifferent nights, from $.50 for a<br />\nslice of pizza on Sunday to $1.00<br />\nfor an imported beer on Wednesday night. The drinking in P.J.'s<br />\nis strictly monitored, I.D.'s are<br />\nrequired at the door, but people<br />\nwho are not yet legal will be admitted during dining hours, and<br />\nthe $.50 slices taste almost as<br />\ngood with a soda. Also available<br />\nare chicken wings, burritos,<br />\nsalads, and the usual selection of<br />\nbar food. For an informal fun<br />\ntime, where you're guaranteed to<br />\nrun into familiar faces, P.J.'s is<br />\nrecommended.<br />\nCharles Village Pub (CVP)<br />\n(3107 St. Paul St., 243-1611):<br />\nThis place has the best happy<br />\nhour deals for legal drinkers in<br />\nCharles Village. Between 4:30<br />\nand 6:30 p.m. mixed drinks are<br />\ntwo for the price of one and beer<br />\n<br />\nis $.50 less than usual. It also has<br />\namazing potato skins ($3.00) and<br />\nhamburgers (two sizes, with<br />\nmany toppings, between $3.00<br />\nand $5.00). During the baseball<br />\nseason it gets very crowded, but<br />\nnot until after the games. Anyone<br />\ncan sit in here, though they are<br />\npretty careful about asking for<br />\nI.D. when you order drinks. It<br />\nhas good reasonably priced food<br />\nand is pretty quiet during dinner<br />\ntime. CVP is great to visit when<br />\nyou want to have a more secluded dinner, without feeling like<br />\nyou're in the middle of the room.<br />\nThe tables are lined up along the<br />\nwall, and the room is always<br />\ndark. CVP delivers food in the<br />\nevenings.<br />\nPizzApeel<br />\n(33rd and Charles Sts.,<br />\n467-0802):<br />\nAlthough PizzApeel is slightly<br />\nmore expensive than either P.J.'s<br />\nor CVP, it is also cleaner, more<br />\nopen, but often very sterile. The<br />\npizza is distinctly different than<br />\nelsewhere in the city. It's called<br />\nChicago style, though as a native<br />\nChicagoan I can attest to the fact<br />\nthat it's not real Chicago pizza.<br />\nIt is good if you like a thicker<br />\ncrust pizza, and two slices can fill<br />\nyou up for a month. The best deal<br />\nat PizzApeel is the all you can eat<br />\nsalad, soup and pizza bar. At<br />\nlunch it costs only $4.00, and<br />\nseveral nights a week it is<br />\navailable for dinner for only<br />\n$5.25. They also have great big<br />\nfrozen drinks, which can be<br />\nordered with or without alcohol.<br />\nEither way they're a treat on a hot<br />\nhumid Baltimore evening. The<br />\nhot drinks in the winter can also<br />\nbe a nice way to end dinner. I<br />\nespecially recommend the frozen<br />\nstrawberry daiquiris. The glass is<br />\npractically big enough to swim in<br />\n(for only $3.00). This is a good<br />\nplace to go if you want to feel like<br />\nyou're \"going out for dinner,\"<br />\nrather than just getting something<br />\nto eat, when you can't leave<br />\n<br />\nCharles Village.<br />\nCC Carry Out<br />\n(32nd and St. Paul Sts.,<br />\n235-4429):<br />\nThe people who run CC are<br />\nprobably the nicest people you<br />\ncan meet in the city. The food is<br />\ngood cheap fare. Most of it is<br />\nkind of greasy, all is informal.<br />\nMy personal favorite is the pizza<br />\nsub, but my roommate loves the<br />\ncheesesteak sub. It's a good quick<br />\nmeal, you go in, order at the<br />\ncounter, when your food is ready,<br />\nthey yell for you, and you go get<br />\nit and bring it to your table. No<br />\ntip, no paying for service, just<br />\ngood cheap food. The fries are<br />\nalso great, and you can get ice<br />\ncream cones, sandwiches and<br />\nsodas as well as hot subs. The<br />\nsubs range in price from $3.00 on<br />\nup. Not necessarily big on atmosphere, CC makes up for it in<br />\nfriendliness and informality.<br />\nMany upperclassmen who don't<br />\neat at the Terrace Room practically have a meal plan set up here.<br />\nHomewood Delli<br />\n(3105 St. Paul St., 467-7882):<br />\nThough we all agree it's<br />\nridiculous to spell Deli with two<br />\nl's, we still go here to get typical<br />\ndeli food. There's a section for<br />\nsandwiches and hot food (good,<br />\nbut greasy, fried chicken for example), and a section for deli<br />\nitems to take home in greater<br />\nquantities. The service is cafeteria<br />\nstyle, with plenty of tables at<br />\nwhich to sit and enjoy your meal.<br />\nHomewood Delli also has a<br />\nbakery counter with good<br />\ncroissants, and an ice cream<br />\ncounter that makes a mean<br />\nmilkshake. This place is also not<br />\nbig on atmosphere, but for a<br />\nchange from the Terrace Room<br />\nit's not a bad place to go with<br />\nfriends. The macaroni and cheese<br />\nis great, if you're a fan like I am<br />\n($1.99), and the reubens are pretty good, too. ($4.00).<br />\n<br />\nThe Grad Club<br />\n(34th St. between Charles and St.<br />\nPaul Sts., in the basement of<br />\nMcCoy Hall, 366-1121):<br />\nThis is personally my favorite<br />\nplace to go hang out. This is the<br />\nplace that makes up for the lack<br />\nof atmosphere in the rest of the<br />\nplaces in Charles Village. It has<br />\na greatjuke box (though the songs<br />\ncould stand to be changed a little<br />\nmore frequently) and lots of great<br />\npinball machines. The murals on<br />\nthe wall are definitely not to be<br />\nmissed. The Grad Club is run by<br />\nHopkins grad students, and<br />\nserves food, soda, beer, and<br />\nwine. It is not limited to grad<br />\nstudents, although a lot do hang<br />\nout there.

Have no<br />\nfear, however, because I'll be<br />\nlending my usually biased opinions to the ol'Flipside on a more<br />\nor less regular basis. For now,<br />\nhowever, let's scope the scene.<br />\nOkay, well, this past weekend<br />\nwas a hoot. Following the suggestions of my more counter-culture<br />\noriented friends, I decided to<br />\ncheck out the happenings at The<br />\nMaryland Institute of Art, located<br />\njust over North Avenue on Mount<br />\nRoyal. Just head down Howard<br />\ntill you cross over North Ave,<br />\nthen go across the bridge and<br />\nmake a left on Mt. Royal. When<br />\nyou start seeing strange people<br />\ndressed in black, you're there.<br />\nSo anyway, Saturday night a<br />\ncarload of us headed down there<br />\nto check out this film Pym,<br />\ndirected by some local amateur,<br />\n<br />\nand to check out this party being<br />\nheld afterwards. I was a little put<br />\noff at first, because the film sucked. Maybe I'm just stupid, but<br />\nafter enduring a Mark Miller film<br />\nclass, I think I know a little about<br />\nfilm. This sucker was completely incoherent to everybody I was<br />\nwith, and I think anybody who<br />\ncould make sense of it was lying.<br />\nWorse yet, it had all the marks of<br />\nbeing an attempt at arty filmmaking, with lots of fast intercutting and 'heavily symbolic'<br />\nshots.<br />\nThis all came to an end around<br />\n9 p.m., and we wandered over to<br />\nthe main building where the party was being held. Being so early, no one was there yet, and the<br />\nband was still soundchecking, so<br />\nwe all grabbed a beer and went<br />\nto the downstairs lounge. At the<br />\nMIA, the downstairs lounge is<br />\nequivalent to the kitchen at<br />\nregular parties\u2014it's the place to<br />\ngo to be cool. After a little while<br />\nwe could hear the opening band<br />\nstart up, and headed upstairs.<br />\nOne thing about an MIA<br />\n<br />\nparty\u2014you'll see more interesting<br />\nlooking people in one night there<br />\nthan you'll ever see in your whole<br />\nHopkins career. The security<br />\npeople looked like the kind of<br />\npeople we try to keep out, and<br />\nsince the party was open to the<br />\npublic, there was a constant<br />\nparade of humanity coming<br />\nthrough the front door,<br />\neverything from chickenhawks to<br />\nskins to Maryland yucks\u2014not a<br />\nscene for the faint of heart, or the<br />\nnaive and uninitiated, but a lot of<br />\nfun nonetheless. Most importantly for us guys (all you hard-core<br />\nfeminists skip this part, 'cause<br />\nyou're gonna get pissed off),<br />\nthere was a constant flow of attractive, decently intelligent<br />\nyoung ladies who would actually<br />\nspeak to you. After two and a half<br />\nyears of the social tundra that is<br />\nHopkins, this was like a night in<br />\nparadise.<br />\nAlso quite important was the<br />\nfact that the MIA has some decent<br />\ntaste in music. The headlining<br />\nband, Instant Siberia, sounded a<br />\nbit like The Cure probably<br />\n<br />\nwould've sounded if they were<br />\nAmerican. Strike a few points for<br />\na less than totally original sound,<br />\nbut they still laid down a mean<br />\nparty groove of original tunes that<br />\nI was more than happy to semipogo to. As for the opening band,<br />\nOne Word, I can only think of<br />\none word to describe them: good.<br />\nBoasting a dual drum set, these<br />\nguys put down some funkiness<br />\nrather reminiscent of The Red<br />\nHot Chili Peppers (and I'm not<br />\njust saying that because the<br />\nbassist looked like Mike B. the<br />\nFlea). The bands were good, the<br />\naudience loved it (this was the<br />\nkind of crowd that starts to undress when it gets warm on the<br />\ndance floor), and I can't say that<br />\nI ever got really bored. All for<br />\nfive bucks (the film cost three)<br />\nnot counting beer (Natty Boh<br />\ngoes for $1, making it twice as<br />\nexpensive as your average Hop<br />\nevent beer). Overall, I can sum<br />\nit up this way: After two and a<br />\nhalf years of bland, white-bread<br />\nHop events, I've finally found a<br />\nvirtual deli of a cultural scene.<br />\n<br />\nFlips/des of Summer<br />\nRefined...<br />\nby John Park<br />\n1967 had the summer of love,<br />\n1988 had the summer of blips,<br />\n.beeps, and booms. While there<br />\nwere no \"Pump Up the<br />\nVolume' s this year, the sampling and hacking of soundmasters<br />\nColdcut Bomb the Bass, eta!continued unabated in the clubs, so<br />\nmuch so that out of sheer<br />\nboredom, I sought something a<br />\nlittle more organic, music made<br />\nof thought, not manipulation.<br />\nI managed to uncover at least<br />\ntwo seminal recordings, the first<br />\nof which, Kip Hanrahan's Days<br />\nand Nights ofBlue Lurk Inverted,<br />\nbridges the nearly two-and-a-half<br />\nyears of silence since his fantastic<br />\nVertical's Currency (like Days,<br />\nalso to be reissued on the new<br />\nSting/Miles Copeland label,<br />\nPangaea).<br />\nHanrahan has always floated<br />\nsomewhere on the fringe of New<br />\nYork's \"avant-hipster\" scene, a<br />\nself-proclaimed \"musical conceptualist,\" and with Days he<br />\npaints an incisive portrait of every<br />\naffair that ever began in wine and<br />\nended in whisky. (An excerpt<br />\nfrom the inner sleeve: \"He once<br />\nloved this woman. And they<br />\nmade love so hard the walls<br />\nwould sweat. And the bed would<br />\nbreak to pieces and the light<br />\nwould fall away. He didn't know<br />\nif she made love that way out of<br />\nanger or joy, and the way he<br />\ndidn't understand it was the way<br />\nhe was driven to love her so<br />\nhard.\" Get the picture?).<br />\nIt's a sultry, suave combination<br />\nof ballad sax and latin rhythms,<br />\nmoody lyrics and azure voices, a<br />\nsemi-autobiggraphical detailing<br />\nof Hanrahan's relationship with<br />\nhis wife, Nancy. It's an album<br />\nwhose poetic rhetoric is so<br />\n<br />\ncentered and strong that<br />\nHanrahan can weave a doubletake lyric like \" The same way<br />\nPalestine refuses to disappear<br />\nfrom the map/is the same way I<br />\nam going to refuse to disappear<br />\nfrom your heart\" seamlessly between a fitful bass and raindrop<br />\ncongas.<br />\nToo, the pure musical virtuosity here is startling. Hanrahan has<br />\nassembled a large cast of New<br />\nYork's best session musicians(he<br />\nformed roughly three overlapping<br />\nbands) including Milton Cardona,<br />\nAnton Fier, Jack Bruce,<br />\nGentleman John Stubblefield, and<br />\nthey play unhurriedly, with<br />\nsincere inspiration. Of the<br />\nalubums twelve songs, not one<br />\nruns sour, although side two,<br />\nwith especially brilliant tracks<br />\nlike, \"Ah intruder (female),\"<br />\n\"Lisbon; blue request,\" and<br />\n\"The first and last to love me(2,<br />\nDecember)\" strikes me as being<br />\nslightly more cohesive and wellcomposed. Days and Nights of<br />\nBlue Luck Inverted? I don't know<br />\nexactly what it means, except,<br />\nEssential.<br />\nLikewise, from the smart,<br />\ntailored suits sported by bandmen<br />\nPaul Weller and Mick Talbot on<br />\nthe album sleeve to the music on<br />\nthe vinyl within, The Style Council's lastest, Confessions ofa Pop<br />\nGroup, impresses me with its<br />\nwholly classic aesthetic and attention to detail. While listening to<br />\nthe opening numbers, \"Life at a<br />\nTop People's Health Farm,\"<br />\n\"Why I Went Missing,\" and<br />\n\"How She Threw it All Away,\"<br />\nI was impressed most by the<br />\nband's genuine pop sensibilities,<br />\ntheir subtle sonic flairs, and their<br />\nuncompromising dedication to<br />\ncomposing these songs as songs<br />\nand not as vehicles for political<br />\nrhetoric, a problem which had<br />\noften dulled earlier efforts.<br />\nMusically, the influences here<br />\nare eclectic, ranging from the Im-<br />\n<br />\npressionistic piano of Satie to the<br />\nbreezy and polished styles of Sixties Stan Getz and Modern Jazz<br />\nQuartet; side two (\"The Piano<br />\nPaintings\") is a virtually pastoral,<br />\nsurprisingly effective melding of<br />\njazz and classical styles. The<br />\nCouncillors remain true to their<br />\nbop and Stax roots, however, on<br />\nside one (\"Confessions of a Pop<br />\nGroup\") as the horns play with<br />\ncatchy snap and tight precision<br />\nalongside Mick Talbots near freeform Hammond Organ.

Although Hopkins usually ranks among the Centennial<br />\nConference leaders in offense,<br />\nthe Blue Jays switched to a<br />\nwishbone to capitalize on their<br />\ntremendous depth and experience<br />\nat running back. Though it may<br />\nhave seemed like a logical choice<br />\nat the time, the Hopkins coaches<br />\nmust be having second thoughts<br />\nas the Jays prepare for their home<br />\nopener tonight. The wishbone has<br />\nonly managed 106 yeards on 67<br />\ncarries in the first two games, and<br />\nHopkins has only scored nine<br />\npoints. Though the defense has<br />\nplayed extremely well, they<br />\nhaven't been able to save the Jays<br />\nfrom going 0-2.<br />\nThe Blue Jays could have won<br />\ntheir season opener at Catholic<br />\nUniversity. The offense was<br />\ngiven excellent field position early in the game, and the defense<br />\nwas having no problem handling<br />\nthe Cardinals' potent passing attack. Yet, as they did so many<br />\ntimes last year, the Blue Jays<br />\ncommitted key turnovers and failed to convert on scoring opportunities. The result was an<br />\nopening-day loss to a team that<br />\nthey should have beaten.<br />\nThe Blue Jays clearly had the<br />\nmomentum in the first quarter, as<br />\nsome excellent defense and solid<br />\npunting by Gary Rupert kept<br />\nCatholic pinned near their own<br />\nend zone. When Joe Sokolowski<br />\nrecovered a Drew Komlo fumble<br />\nat the CUA 25, the Hopkins<br />\nwishbone was handed a golden<br />\nopportunity to notch the first<br />\npoints of the season. With Rupert<br />\nat quarterback, the wishbone<br />\npounded the ball inside the Cardinal 10-yard line. On a fourthand-six, Coach Jerry Pfeifer<br />\ndecided to try for the first down<br />\ninstead of kicking the field goal,<br />\nbut the CUA defense held and<br />\ntook possession at the 7.<br />\nThe Hopkins defense again<br />\nfrustrated the Cardinals and forced them to punt out of their own<br />\nend zone. With junior Eric<br />\nTrenaman at quarterback, the<br />\nBlue Jays put together a nice<br />\ndrive, highlighted by a 16-yard<br />\n<br />\nrun by Chris Chirieleison.<br />\nTrenaman then hit sophomore<br />\nChris Ogeneski for a 10-yard<br />\nscoring pass to put Hopkins ahead<br />\n6-0.<br />\nThe next time Hopkins got the<br />\nball, the momentum began to shift<br />\ntoward CUA. Trenaman underthrew his receiver, and the Cardinals' Bill Doyle made a spectacular one-handed interception.<br />\nCatholic then put together an impressive drive led by Komlo, considered one of the finest quarterbacks in Division III football. He<br />\npicked away at the Blue Jays<br />\ndefense with short passes, driving his team from their own 8 to<br />\nthe Hopkins 25. The Jays then appeared to stop the Cardinals on a<br />\nfourth-and-two play, but a<br />\nroughing-the-passer penalty gave<br />\nthe ball back to CUA. Komlo<br />\nthen connected with Jeff Boyer on<br />\na 5-yard TD strike, and the extrapoint put Catholic ahead 7-6.<br />\nWith the momentum gone, the<br />\nHopkins offense began to<br />\nflounder. The wishbone became<br />\n'ineffective as the Blue Jays used<br />\nthe fullback option almost every<br />\nplay. When the quarterback did<br />\nrollout, it usually resulted in a<br />\nfumble. Brock Bowman, who<br />\nbecame the third Hopkins<br />\nquarterback of the afternoon,<br />\nmissed Brian Dulin on the<br />\nhalfback option early in the third<br />\nquarter, and Catholic recovered<br />\nthe fumble on the Jays' 3-yard<br />\nline. The tough Hopkins defense<br />\nagain refused to yield, as Jeff<br />\nSheaffer saved a touchdown by<br />\nputting a tremendous hit on Cardinals' receiver Mike Patronik in<br />\nthe end zone. CUA had to settle<br />\nfor a field goal and a 10-6 lead.<br />\nThe bright spot for the Blue<br />\nJays was definitely the defense,<br />\nwhich kept Hopkins in the game<br />\ndespite five key turnovers.<br />\nLinebackers Steve Davis, Charles<br />\nJohnson-Bey, Larry Rytel, and<br />\nMike Fenzel kept Drew Komlo in<br />\ncheck all afternoon as they accounted for twenty solo tackles.<br />\nJoe Sokolowski, spectacular at<br />\nmonster back, had two sacks and<br />\nsix tackles.<br />\n\"Joe's a real hitter, an enforcer,\" commented Coach<br />\nPfeifer. \"When he catches a guy<br />\nright, he puts him out of the<br />\ngame.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe offensive line will have it's work cut out for it against FDU<br />\n<br />\nGary Rupert (above) will get the starting nod at QB tonight<br />\nThe big question marks for the<br />\nHopkins offense sputtered, and<br />\nJays were on offense, most<br />\nthe Jays fell to 0-2 despite an exspecifically at quarterback.

Tonight<br />\nat 7:30, Hopkins will host<br />\nFairleigh Dickinson (Madison)<br />\nunder the lights at Homewood<br />\nField. The Jersey Devils are<br />\nperhaps the biggest and quickest<br />\nteam on the Blue Jays schedule,<br />\nand they are flying high after an<br />\nopening 14-3 victory over Jersey<br />\nCity State. The Devils field an<br />\nFile photo<br />\n<br />\nFile photo<br />\n<br />\nawesome defensive unit led by<br />\njunior linebacker John Clarke and<br />\nsophomore Glenn Kipila, a 6'6\u2014,<br />\n280 pound tackle who racked up<br />\nfour quarterback sacks in the<br />\nseason opener.<br />\nLast year, the Devils held<br />\nHopkins to 0 yards rushing and<br />\n129 yards passing in route to a<br />\n14-7 wins. The game will probably be a tremendous defensive<br />\nbattle, unless the Jays can find a<br />\nleader at quarterback. Senior<br />\nGary Rupert will get the starting<br />\nnod, and Coach Pfeifer is hoping<br />\nthat his experience will help spark<br />\nthe struggling offense. Hopkins<br />\nneeds to find a reliable quarterback to run their offense, and<br />\nthey need to find him quickly.<br />\n\"The starting quarterback<br />\nwon't be the guy who makes the<br />\nbig play. It will be the guy who<br />\navoids the bad play.\" said<br />\nPfeifer.<br />\nIf they can find that guy, the<br />\nBlue Jays are capable of winning<br />\nfive or six games this season. If<br />\nthey don't, they may be in for<br />\nmore frustrating losses like the<br />\nfirst two.<br />\nNOTES: Brian Dulin is the<br />\nleading Hopkins rusher after the<br />\nfirst two games with 71 yards on<br />\n19 carries.

The home<br />\nopener win improved the Lady<br />\nJays' record to 3-1.<br />\nHopkins dominated the entire<br />\ngame, outshooting Notre Dame<br />\n47 to 1, but the Jays were<br />\nleading only 1-0 at half time on<br />\nOrdonez' first goal three minutes<br />\ninto the game. Ordonez then exploded, scoring the next two<br />\ngoals in the first thirteen minutes<br />\nof the second half and another<br />\nwith six minutes left in the game.<br />\nJulie Siegrist scored two minutes<br />\nlater off a pass from Jennifer<br />\nChun, followed by Jackie Fatula<br />\none minute later off another pass<br />\nby Chun. Both Siegrist and Fatula<br />\nhad an assist as well.<br />\nThe Lady Jays kicked off their<br />\nseason on Saturday, September<br />\n10, with a hard-fought 1-0 double overtime win over MAC rival<br />\nWidener University. The Jays<br />\ntraditionally have trouble at their<br />\nfirst away game, but after a backand-forth regulatioti game,<br />\nHopkins took control in the second overtime period as Jackie<br />\nFatula scored the winning goal<br />\noff a shot by Meredith Blitz. According to coach Sally Beth<br />\nAnderson, \"we played hockey<br />\nlike we are capable of. We had<br />\na better passing game and concentrated on getting more shots off.\"<br />\nHopkins then suffered their only loss, 3-0, at Gettysburg on<br />\nThursday, September 15. The<br />\nLady Jays had more shots-on-goal<br />\nthan Gettysburg, but still lost<br />\nbecause their playing wasn't up to<br />\npar. According to captain Jackie<br />\nFatula, \"We just didn't perform<br />\nas well as we could have. Our<br />\ntiming was off, our passes were<br />\noff.\"<br />\nHopkins got their act together<br />\ntwo days later, however,<br />\ndefeating the Dickinson Red<br />\nDevils 2-0. Patti Ordonez scored<br />\nfive minutes into the game off a<br />\n<br />\npass from Susan Steinwald.<br />\nKathy Herring later added an insurance goal by deflecting in a<br />\nshot by Jackie Fatula. Even<br />\nthough the game was played in a<br />\nheavy downpour, the Lady Jays<br />\nplayed exceptionally well, with<br />\nCoach Anderson describing the<br />\ngame as an \"impressive<br />\nvictory.\"<br />\nAnderson, who is in her<br />\nseventh year of coaching field<br />\nhockey at Hopkins, hopes to improve on last year's record-setting<br />\nseason in which Hopkins amassed an impressive 14-3-1 record.<br />\nThe 63 goals scored last season<br />\nwere the greatest goal output ever<br />\nby a Hopkins team, while the<br />\ndefense, anchored by goalie Jennifer O'Hara, allowed only 13<br />\ngoals. The Jays' season ended in<br />\na 3-2 double overtime loss to<br />\nDrew University in the first<br />\nround of the MAC playoffs.<br />\nThis year's squad is led by a<br />\npair of senior co-captains, Jackie<br />\nFatula at forward and Kathy Hart<br />\nat center midfield. Fatula is the<br />\nleading returning scorer with 13<br />\ngoals and 5 assists and was named to the NCAA Southern Region<br />\nAllMention<br />\nHonorable<br />\nAmerican Team. Hart scored 11<br />\ngoals with 2 assists last year and<br />\nwas named to the NCAA National Honorable Mention AllAmerican Team.<br />\n. Hopkins just missed getting an<br />\nNCAA bid last season, but<br />\nAnderson hopes that will change.<br />\n\"I think the weakness of our<br />\nschedule hurt our chances of getting a bid last year, but that won't<br />\nbe the case this year. We dropped some of the weaker teams on<br />\nour schedule and picked up Division III power Salisbury State, the<br />\nNational<br />\nNCAA<br />\n1986<br />\nChampion.\"<br />\nIn their next week of play, the<br />\nLady Jays travel to Franklin &<br />\nThursday,<br />\non<br />\nMarshall<br />\nSeptember 22.

Despite their most recent<br />\nloss to Western Maryland 0-3,<br />\nHopkins can boast of some promising statistics, including three<br />\nkills, three aces, sixty-one digs,<br />\nand five blocks in nine attempts.<br />\nThe 1988 squad is fortunate in<br />\nmany ways. For instance, the acquisition of a new varsity coach,<br />\nthe return of nine athletes, and the<br />\narrival of two new strong<br />\nfreshman should allow the Lady<br />\nJays to continue their upward<br />\nmomentum. Coach Bill Jones, a<br />\nformer assistant coach at Notre<br />\nDame, brings with him both college coaching experience and the<br />\nexperience of coaching five years<br />\nat the high school level. Jones has<br />\na very positive attitude about his<br />\nteam and their prospects this<br />\nseason. \"My goal is to maintain<br />\nthe momentum that [former<br />\ncoach] Dawn Finnessey started<br />\nand better last season's 8-12<br />\nrecord. In the short term, I hope<br />\nto work on developing consistency in play,\" Jones stated.<br />\n<br />\nThe Lady Jays have nine returning players, including seven<br />\nfrom last year's 8-12 team and<br />\ntwo former players. Ashi Rafi,<br />\nPatrina Hsi, Jill Kness, Beth<br />\nMonahan, Angela Muras, Dawn<br />\nNee, and Rochelle Payne are<br />\nback from last fall, while Joy<br />\nBoyer and Alison Unger are back<br />\non the squad after taking a year<br />\noff. Muras, a strong hitter, and<br />\nMonahan, an effective middle<br />\nblocker, should prove to be<br />\nstrong players for the varsity this<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe team has been blessed this<br />\nyear with the arrival of two<br />\nfreshmen, both of whom are<br />\nstarters this season. Trang Phain,<br />\nof Rockville H.S. in Rockville,<br />\nMD, and Jennifer Kishimoni, of<br />\nSan Francisco, both \"have a lot<br />\nof potential, great ability, and<br />\nknowledge of the game,\" according to Coach Jones. Pham, a<br />\n5'5\" setter, is an experienced<br />\nplayer with hitting ability, while<br />\nKishimoni is both an effective setter and hitter.<br />\nCo-captain Boyer thinks that<br />\n\"with most of the starters returning and a few new additions, including a great new coach, we<br />\nshould have a really good<br />\nseason.\" This attitude is echoed<br />\n<br />\nby Coach Jones, in realizing that,<br />\n\"when we play our best, we can<br />\nbeat anyone.\"<br />\nThe Lady Jays' next game is at<br />\nTuesday,<br />\nDickinson, on<br />\nSeptember 27.

The new parking plan will help defray the costs<br />\nof maintaining and expanding the<br />\ncurrent parking system.<br />\nOn-site parking manager Floyd<br />\nStanley said he foresees no problems with the switch to the new<br />\nsystem. Beginning Monday, October 3, a wooden gate will bar<br />\nany unregistered driver without a<br />\ncard from parking on campus, except at the visitor's lot next to<br />\nGarland or at metered spaces.<br />\nEvery driver will pass through<br />\nthe gate twice each time he or she<br />\nuses parking, once on entry and<br />\nonce on exit from the lot. This<br />\nwill prevent multiple drivers from<br />\nusing the same card to enter a<br />\nparking lot. The card's history,<br />\nwhen and where it was used, is<br />\nrecorded both on the access<br />\ncard's infrared coded bar and in<br />\nthe central computer at the parking office.<br />\nWith the switch to paid parking, responsibility for operating<br />\nthe parking system shifts from<br />\ncampus security to Broadway<br />\nServices Inc., a division of the<br />\ncorporate branch of Hopkins.

Security, not BSI, is<br />\nresponsible for enforcing all<br />\nparking regulations.<br />\nStudents wishing to obtain<br /><br />\nparking permits have two<br />\nchoices. The flat rate of $10 per<br />\nmonth, paid at the start of the<br />\nsemester, buys an unlimited access card allowing use of all parking spaces not specifically<br />\ndesignated for faculty. Limited<br />\naccess cards, valid for one year<br />\nafte/. purchase, allow five, ten,<br />\nfifteen, or twenty visits at a cost<br />\nof $1.75 per increment of five.<br />\nAn alternative is to use the<br />\nvisitor's section of the Garland<br /><br />\ntheir traditional meeting places.\"<br />\n\"While there are many rules\"<br />\nsaid Sokolowski, \"the codes are<br />\nbroadly and clearly defined.\"<br />\nThe penalties incurred by Pi<br />\nLambda Phi's breach of the rules<br />\ninclude a semester-long probationary period during which any<br />\nreasonable complaint against the<br />\nfraternity would result in harsher<br />\npenalties.

First is the status of<br />\nstudent housing, particularly<br />\nMcCoy and Wolman Halls, an<br />\nissue that has been discussed at<br />\nadministrative levels for many<br />\nyears. Colombo Said students<br />\nshould become involved in a<br />\nhousing review.<br />\nSecond is the Athletic Center,<br />\nspecifically the dearth of equipment, the inadequacy of the<br />\nwomen's locker rooms, and the<br />\nlack of recreational space for<br />\nteams and intramurals.<br />\nThe final issue is the perceived lack of community at<br />\nHomewood, which has been addressed often, including in last<br />\nyear's Human Climate Task<br />\nForce report.

A respected, experienced Hopkins administrator fills<br />\nthe position left open by an equally<br />\nregarded departing administrator. The<br />\nonly problem is that the position, despite<br />\nthe apparent consistency of title, was<br />\nchanged in the interim by the administration. Changed, to our minds,<br />\nfor the worse.<br />\nFirst, a little background. The position of Dean of Homewood Schools Services was created with the arrival of<br />\nWelch in 1985. Its creation was an attempt to restructure ,and thereby<br />\nstreamline the administration. While<br />\nacademic departments and academic<br />\nauxilary services would continue to<br />\nreport to the two academic deans, the<br />\npreviously scattered non-academic aux,ilary services, including financial aid,<br />\nstudent activities, and housing would<br />\nreport to this new dean. This, in particular, would free up some of the<br />\nacademic deans' time, enabling them to<br />\nconcentrate more fully on academic<br />\naffairs.<br />\nSignificantly also, the restructuring<br />\nrecognized the crucial importance of<br />\nstudent services at Homewood. While<br />\nWelch (read: student services) had to<br />\nnegotiate program funding with the<br />\nacademic deans, he acted independently of them once the budget was settled.<br />\nFurther, Welch reported directly to the<br />\nprovost, John Lombardi. The independence and the direct line to Lombardi combined with the centralization<br />\nof student services gave it more attention and funding than ever before. And<br />\ncertainly the improvements enacted during Welch's tenure, especially the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force Report,<br />\nspeak for themselves.<br />\nThe problem is that with Welch's<br />\ndeparture, the administration saw fit to<br /><br />\nalter the position. Under their plan Colombo reports directly to the academic<br />\ndeans on all matters, budgetary and<br />\notherwise. Their decision prompted Student Council to form an ad hoc committee last Spring aimed at addressing what<br />\nthey (and we)saw as a downgrading of<br />\nthe dean's position, and subsequently,<br />\nof student services. Under the direct<br />\njurisdiction of the academic deans, student services might be sacrificed to the<br />\nneeds of the academic departments.<br />\nBoth Lombardi and University President Steven Muller say we shouldn't<br />\nnotice any significant change in the way<br />\nstudent services are handled under the<br />\nnew system.<br />\nBut we agree with Council's concerns, and here's why:<br />\nFirst, the allocation of money to student services without allowing fiscal<br />\nautonomy is relegating them to a less<br />\nadvantageous spot on the budget<br />\nledger\u2014student services are that much<br />\nfurther from getting the attention they<br />\ndeserve.<br />\nFurther, we ask how academic deans<br />\ncould possibly give sufficient attention<br />\nto vital student services given Arts and<br />\nSciences' present million dollar budget<br />\ndeficit. The reason Welch's position<br />\nwas initially created was because the<br />\ndeans couldn't handle both effectively.<br />\nIt appears then that the efficacy of this<br />\ndeanship rests to a large extent on personality and initiative\u2014disturbingly so.<br />\nWhile we have no reason to believe that<br />\nColombo can't swim with the sharks,<br />\nas it were, why should the position rely<br />\nheavily on such a variable factor as<br />\ndisposition?<br />\nThe grim reality at this point is exactly that it does, however. Muller<br />\nassures undergraduates that the situation<br />\nwill be carefully monitored for any<br />\npossible adverse affects upon student<br />\nservices. It is in our best interest to do<br />\nthe same: we can't afford to be lost in<br />\nthe scramble when the scarce resources<br />\nare allotted.<br /><br />\nThe News..Letter would<br />\nlike to heartily thank<br />\nDr. Susan Boswell<br />\nfor all her patience, support, and perserverance in<br />\nachieving the renaissance<br />\nof the Gatehouse after our<br />\ndisastrous summer<br /><br />\nPseudoperspicacity<br />\nJonathan Engler<br />\nNear the end of my sophomore<br />\nyear I had a dream which I can<br />\nonly attribute to delayed trauma<br />\nfrom freshman year. I dreamt I<br />\nwas sitting in Mudd Hall, in those<br />\nincredibly comfortable, sleepworthy seats when I realized that<br />\nI was in the completely wrong<br />\nroom. But the doors were locked<br />\nand there was no escape. For<br />\nsome reason, in the sort of progression of events that only make<br />\nsense in dreams, I was soon up<br />\non the lectern insulting all of the<br />\nprofessors and TA's that I had in<br />\ntwo years of Johns Hopkins. As<br />\nI stood there, these very professors and TA's began walking<br />\ntowards me from the audience<br />\nlike something from the Night of<br />\nthe Living Dead, wielding pitchforks. I awoke in a cold sweat.<br />\nPitchforks aside, this was a<br />\npretty realistic dream in some<br />\nways. Hopkins upperclassmen,<br />\nhaving been here for several<br />\nyears, often still have no idea<br />\nwhere many of the buildings on<br />\nthis campus are. Particularly<br />\nWriting Seminars majors, who<br />\nnever leave the basement of<br />\nGilman. So for you freshmen<br />\nwho sheepishly find yourselves in<br />\nOrganic Chemistry when what<br />\nyou really want is Occidental<br />\nCivilization, don't worry about it.<br />\nThose arrogant upperclassmen do<br />\nit all the time. I ran into a senior<br />\nfriend of mine this week who sat<br />\nthrough an intermediate Spanish<br />\nclass for forty minues until she<br /><br />\nrealized that it wasn't Italian<br />\nElements. Embarrassed? No<br />\nway. \"The TA was Italian looking, so I thought 'This must be it.'<br />\nOh well.\"<br />\nIndeed, it is almost a sport to<br />\ndirect lost foreign graduate<br />\nstudents to Mergenthaler Hall<br />\nwhen they ask for, say, Ames.<br />\nIt's not that Homewood students<br />\nare malicious. They just have no<br />\nidea where buildings are that<br />\ndon't correspond to their major.<br />\nAnd no-one wants to look like a<br />\nknow-nothing freshman.<br />\nBut if you ask anyone, from<br />\nSteve Muller on down, where the<br />\nStudent Union is, they will look<br />\nat you strangely.

Two of them were<br />\nhistory professors, and they explained the role women and<br />\nminorities had in the history they<br />\nwere teaching and how this came<br />\nto be ignored, through the crippling mechanism of male<br />\ndominance in the teaching of<br />\nhistory.

In fact, they<br />\nrun two stores, one across from<br />\nthe other. One sells only classical<br />\nmusic and the other modern<br />\nmusic. They have a large selection of compact discs at fairly low<br />\nprices, and they rent movies and<br />\nVCR's.<br />\nThe Rotunda Cinema I and II<br />\ncannot support a large number of<br />\nmovies at any one time, but they<br />\nchange features frequently, and<br />\ntheir movies are usually very current. They have a three dollar<br />\nmatinee before 6 pm during the<br />\nweek, and then the price jumps to<br />\nthe usual rate for a movie in<br /><br />\nBaltimore, five dollars. Student<br />\ndiscounts are available Monday<br />\nthrough Thursday. On holidays<br />\nand weekends only the first showing is at matinee prices.

Is there no justice?<br />\nUnfortunately, the law is the<br />\nlaw and not even Hopkins<br />\nstudents are above it. The University role in enforcing that law is<br />\nfairly clear. According to Andrea<br />\nPerry, Director of Residential<br />\nLife, \"The University has an<br />\nobligation to have its residents<br />\nunderstand the law...they are<br />\nresponsible for their own<br />\nbehavior. Further, we have a<br />\nresponsibility to police consumption and possession of alcohol<br />\nin public.

Its major attractions are<br />\nsituated right beside the<br />\nChesapeake Bay.<br />\nThe Light Street and Pratt<br />\nStreet Pavilions make up Harborplace, a collection of 140<br />\nspecialty shops and restaurants.<br />\nFor general shopping, one can<br />\nbrowse through the Pratt Street<br />\nPavilion; it contains stores selling<br />\nclothing, shoes, fine china, and<br />\nimpressive selections of unusual<br />\ncards, stuffed animals, music<br />\nboxes and games. Several famous<br />\nrestaurants specializing in Indian<br />\n(Tandoor), Grecian (Taverna<br />\nAthena), and seafood (Mariner's<br />\nPier One) dishes are located inside the two-level building. One<br />\ncan dine while looking at the Inner Harbor Marina in the Bamboo House. This Chinese<br />\nrestaurant serves Mandarin and<br />\nSzechuan cuisine in a \"bamboo\"<br />\ntheme setting.<br />\nWhile the Light Street Pavilion<br />\nalso offers several restaurants, its<br />\ngreatest attraction is a wide variety of food stands. On the ground<br />\nlevel, one can buy exotic<br />\ncookbooks, multi-flavored jelly<br />\nbeans, honey-laden baked goods,<br />\nand lollipops which come in ice<br />\ncream flavors like chocolate mint.<br />\nThe jelly bean store also sells the<br />\nultimate in chocolate games: a<br />\ncomplete multi-colored Monopoly board, bank money included,<br />\nwhich sells for only $500.<br />\nOn the second level of the<br />\npavilion, there are a variety of<br />\nshops and more food vendors.<br />\nFor people who adore penguins.<br />\nor love the Orioles, each bird has<br />\nits own stand filled with items<br />\ndecorated with its likeness.

Again, there are many<br />\nspecialty food stands including<br />\nfresh produce, and the short hike<br />\ntakes you past department stores,<br />\noffice buildings, and more<br />\n\"local\" entertainment areas. The<br />\nLexington Mall shops are geared<br />\nmore for neighborhood shoppers<br />\nthan tourists.<br />\nIn planning a trip to the Inner<br />\nHarbor area, it should be noted<br />\nthat both pavilions and nearby<br />\nConvention Center mall contain<br />\n\"Easy-Bank\" or \"Most\"<br />\nmachines. You can take the<br />\nnumber 3 and number 61 buses<br />\ndown St. Paul Street to within<br />\nseveral blocks of the harbor. In<br />\nfact, the 3 bus passes Lexington<br />\nMall at Saratoga and Howard<br />\nStreets. For someone brand new<br />\nto Baltimore, the downtown area<br />\nis an easily accessible place to get<br />\nacquainted with the city, and it<br />\nshould take many visits to see all<br />\nthe attractions.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/19<br /><br />\nMount Vernon is culture<br />\nRestaurant Sampler<br />\nby Eric Blumenfeld and Erica<br />\nGum<br />\nIf you need a break from the<br />\nTerrace Room and just can't seem<br />\nto find satisfaction in Charles<br />\nVillage, you might want to consider some of Baltimore's best<br />\nfood in Mount Vernon. Mount<br />\nVernon is a stretch of unique<br />\nrestaurants and odd shops near<br />\nthe Washington monument on the<br />\n800 block of North Charles. Here<br />\nis a sampling:<br />\nTony Cheng's Szechuan (801<br />\nN.Charles St., 539-6666)<br />\nFor the best Chinese food in<br />\nBaltimore, stop by Tony<br />\nCheng's. They serve superb<br />\nSzechuan cuisine and some Mandarin dishes. Dinner will cost<br />\nabout twenty dollars a head for a<br />\nfull meal, but be prepared to pay<br />\neven more for specialty dishes..<br />\nWeekday lunches are significantly cheaper.<br />\nLouie's Bookstore Cafe (518<br />\nN.Charles St. 962-1224):<br />\nLouie's appeals to the artist in<br />\nall of us. The cafe itself is<br />\ndecorated with paintings from<br />\nlocal artists (all for sale), and live<br />\nclassical music is played during<br />\ndinner. Lunch offers cafe items<br />\nsuch as salads and sandwiches<br />\nwith a twist. Louie's is also<br />\nrumored to have the best coffee<br />\nin Baltimore. The dinner menu<br />\noffers and interesting combination of entrees like tenthouse<br />\nchicken (chicken breasts with<br />\noyster stuffing) or pasta<br />\nprimavera (fettucine and fresh<br />\nvegetables in a cream sauce).<br />\nOutshining the entrees, which can<br />\nbe too eclectic for some tastes,<br />\nare Louie's deserts. From<br />\nChocolate Chip Cheescake and<br />\nWhite Chocolate Pound Cake to<br />\nChocolate Fudge Torte and<br />\nMocha Raspberry Cake, there is<br />\nsomething to satisfy any sweet-<br /><br />\nGampy's: The Great American Melting Pot.<br />\ntooth. A full dinner with appetizer<br />\nwill cost around $20 per person<br />\nincluding tip.<br />\nGampy 's<br />\n(904 N. Charles, 837-9797):<br />\nGampy's, or The Great<br />\nAmerican Melting POt, is all that<br />\nit's name entails. The menu is exceptionally diverse. You can<br />\norder all types of food from hot<br />\ndogs to Beef Welligton. And the<br /><br />\nNews-Letter file<br /><br />\nfood is consistently excellent.<br />\nBecause the customer is not<br />\nlimited to ordering an entree,<br />\nprices vary, but they are not exorbitant. Gampy's does not take<br />\nreservations so be sure to call early on weekend nights.<br />\nThe Red Sea<br />\n(Around the corner from Tony<br />\nCheng's, 547-8178)<br />\nThe Red Sea is the only Ethio-<br /><br />\npian restaurant in Baltimore.<br />\nEthiopian cuisine is similar to Indian food in flavor, but it is not<br />\nnearly as strong\u2014better suited to<br />\nAmerican palates. Another novelty is that you eat it with your<br />\nhands. If this repulses you, that<br />\nis a shame because the food is<br />\nquite good. The staff is quite<br />\nhelpful for E-Cuisine virgins.<br />\nThey can even recommend entrees for you if you find yourself<br />\nlost in the transliterations. An entree with a glass of Tej (honey<br />\nwine) will set you back bewteen<br />\n$15 and $20, even less without<br />\nthe wine.<br />\nTransportation to Mount Vernon is easy by the Med School<br />\nShuttle (see schedule elsewhere in<br />\nthis article), and it's free! Just get<br />\noff at the Peabody Conservatory<br />\nand walk up the hill to Charles<br />\nStreet. You can also take a city<br />\nbus downtown. Most buses go<br />\ndown Cathedral Street. Get off<br />\naround the 800 block and walk<br />\ndown a block to Charles Street.<br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory,<br />\nlocated in the Mount Vernon<br />\narea, is one of the few bastions<br />\nof the humanities in the melee of<br />\nscience at Hopkins which so<br />\nmany seem to aspire to.

It is<br />\nthe area to where most upperclassmen flock, after being<br />\nthrown out of their dormitory<br />\nnests.<br />\nEating and drinking in Charles<br />\nVillage can be limited, but it can<br />\nalso be good. There's a range of<br />\naffordable food, from pizza to<br />\nThai. Below is a partial list of the<br />\navailable restaurants, but it is also<br />\nrecommended that you explore<br />\nwhatever else you can find.<br />\nP.J.'s Pub<br />\n(3333 N. Charles St., 243-8844):<br />\nLocated on Charles between<br />\n33rd and 34th Streets in the basement of The Charles apartment<br />\nbuilding. Pizza and beer are the<br />\nmain attractions. It has been listed<br />\nin the City Paper's Best of<br />\nBaltimore issue for many years as<br />\nhaving the best assortment of<br />\ndraft beer. It has great deals on<br />\ndifferent nights, from $.50 for a<br />\nslice of pizza on Sunday to $1.00<br />\nfor an imported beer on Wednesday night. The drinking in P.J.'s<br />\nis strictly monitored, I.D.'s are<br />\nrequired at the door, but people<br />\nwho are not yet legal will be admitted during dining hours, and<br />\nthe $.50 slices taste almost as<br />\ngood with a soda. Also available<br />\nare chicken wings, burritos,<br />\nsalads, and the usual selection of<br />\nbar food. For an informal fun<br />\ntime, where you're guaranteed to<br />\nrun into familiar faces, P.J.'s is<br />\nrecommended.<br />\nCharles Village Pub (CVP)<br />\n(3107 St. Paul St., 243-1611):<br />\nThis place has the best happy<br />\nhour deals for legal drinkers in<br />\nCharles Village. Between 4:30<br />\nand 6:30 p.m. mixed drinks are<br />\ntwo for the price of one and beer<br /><br />\nis $.50 less than usual. It also has<br />\namazing potato skins ($3.00) and<br />\nhamburgers (two sizes, with<br />\nmany toppings, between $3.00<br />\nand $5.00). During the baseball<br />\nseason it gets very crowded, but<br />\nnot until after the games. Anyone<br />\ncan sit in here, though they are<br />\npretty careful about asking for<br />\nI.D. when you order drinks. It<br />\nhas good reasonably priced food<br />\nand is pretty quiet during dinner<br />\ntime. CVP is great to visit when<br />\nyou want to have a more secluded dinner, without feeling like<br />\nyou're in the middle of the room.<br />\nThe tables are lined up along the<br />\nwall, and the room is always<br />\ndark. CVP delivers food in the<br />\nevenings.<br />\nPizzApeel<br />\n(33rd and Charles Sts.,<br />\n467-0802):<br />\nAlthough PizzApeel is slightly<br />\nmore expensive than either P.J.'s<br />\nor CVP, it is also cleaner, more<br />\nopen, but often very sterile. The<br />\npizza is distinctly different than<br />\nelsewhere in the city. It's called<br />\nChicago style, though as a native<br />\nChicagoan I can attest to the fact<br />\nthat it's not real Chicago pizza.<br />\nIt is good if you like a thicker<br />\ncrust pizza, and two slices can fill<br />\nyou up for a month. The best deal<br />\nat PizzApeel is the all you can eat<br />\nsalad, soup and pizza bar. At<br />\nlunch it costs only $4.00, and<br />\nseveral nights a week it is<br />\navailable for dinner for only<br />\n$5.25. They also have great big<br />\nfrozen drinks, which can be<br />\nordered with or without alcohol.<br />\nEither way they're a treat on a hot<br />\nhumid Baltimore evening. The<br />\nhot drinks in the winter can also<br />\nbe a nice way to end dinner. I<br />\nespecially recommend the frozen<br />\nstrawberry daiquiris. The glass is<br />\npractically big enough to swim in<br />\n(for only $3.00). This is a good<br />\nplace to go if you want to feel like<br />\nyou're \"going out for dinner,\"<br />\nrather than just getting something<br />\nto eat, when you can't leave<br /><br />\nCharles Village.<br />\nCC Carry Out<br />\n(32nd and St. Paul Sts.,<br />\n235-4429):<br />\nThe people who run CC are<br />\nprobably the nicest people you<br />\ncan meet in the city. The food is<br />\ngood cheap fare. Most of it is<br />\nkind of greasy, all is informal.<br />\nMy personal favorite is the pizza<br />\nsub, but my roommate loves the<br />\ncheesesteak sub. It's a good quick<br />\nmeal, you go in, order at the<br />\ncounter, when your food is ready,<br />\nthey yell for you, and you go get<br />\nit and bring it to your table. No<br />\ntip, no paying for service, just<br />\ngood cheap food. The fries are<br />\nalso great, and you can get ice<br />\ncream cones, sandwiches and<br />\nsodas as well as hot subs. The<br />\nsubs range in price from $3.00 on<br />\nup. Not necessarily big on atmosphere, CC makes up for it in<br />\nfriendliness and informality.<br />\nMany upperclassmen who don't<br />\neat at the Terrace Room practically have a meal plan set up here.<br />\nHomewood Delli<br />\n(3105 St. Paul St., 467-7882):<br />\nThough we all agree it's<br />\nridiculous to spell Deli with two<br />\nl's, we still go here to get typical<br />\ndeli food. There's a section for<br />\nsandwiches and hot food (good,<br />\nbut greasy, fried chicken for example), and a section for deli<br />\nitems to take home in greater<br />\nquantities. The service is cafeteria<br />\nstyle, with plenty of tables at<br />\nwhich to sit and enjoy your meal.<br />\nHomewood Delli also has a<br />\nbakery counter with good<br />\ncroissants, and an ice cream<br />\ncounter that makes a mean<br />\nmilkshake. This place is also not<br />\nbig on atmosphere, but for a<br />\nchange from the Terrace Room<br />\nit's not a bad place to go with<br />\nfriends. The macaroni and cheese<br />\nis great, if you're a fan like I am<br />\n($1.99), and the reubens are pretty good, too. ($4.00).<br /><br />\nThe Grad Club<br />\n(34th St. between Charles and St.<br />\nPaul Sts., in the basement of<br />\nMcCoy Hall, 366-1121):<br />\nThis is personally my favorite<br />\nplace to go hang out. This is the<br />\nplace that makes up for the lack<br />\nof atmosphere in the rest of the<br />\nplaces in Charles Village. It has<br />\na greatjuke box (though the songs<br />\ncould stand to be changed a little<br />\nmore frequently) and lots of great<br />\npinball machines. The murals on<br />\nthe wall are definitely not to be<br />\nmissed. The Grad Club is run by<br />\nHopkins grad students, and<br />\nserves food, soda, beer, and<br />\nwine. It is not limited to grad<br />\nstudents, although a lot do hang<br />\nout there. It's a wonderful place<br />\nto stop in late at night, after the<br />\nlibrary closes, for a drink, and<br />\nthey serve the best french fries in<br />\nall of Baltimore.<br />\nOther food options range from<br />\nhamburgers to chicken fingers.<br />\nEvery few weeks there will be a<br />\nband performing on the weekend,<br />\nand usually admission is charged<br />\n(usually $1.00). Things tend to<br />\nget more crowded on these occasions, but it adds to the glamour<br />\nof the red and white tablecloths.<br />\nIn addition, the Grad Club is<br />\navailable for parties. Talk to the<br />\nbartender if you're interested.<br />\nThe people who work there are<br />\nusually people you've run into on<br />\ncampus (probably in the Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop), and the people who<br />\nhang out the most there are people you've definitely seen hanging around the coffee shop, probably drinking too much coffee<br />\nand wearing lots of black.<br />\nThai Restaurant<br />\n(3316 Greenmount Ave.',<br />\n889-7303):<br />\nFor a nice change in ethnic<br />\nfood, Thai is great. The food is<br />\nmostly spicy, but some is not.<br />\nThe curries, red, green, and<br />\nyellow, each with different<br />\nvegetables, are great(from $6.00<br />\nto $8.00) and pretty spicy. you<br /><br />\ncan get them with different types<br />\nof meat or chicken or shrimp.<br />\nAlso recommended are the Pad<br />\nThai, a rice and shrimp dish that's<br />\nnot spicy ($6.00) and the Gai<br />\nSawan ($4.00) a crabmeat stuffed chicken appetizer. The spring<br />\nrolls are also quite good. Occasionally the restaurant will have<br />\nspecials, which are usually a good<br />\nbet. For about $15.00 per person<br />\nyou can have a nice meal with a<br />\nmain course, appetizer, and<br />\ndrink, and leave feeling very<br />\nfull\u2014the entrees are quite large.<br />\nThere are other restaurants in<br />\nthe area that are also good.

Have no<br />\nfear, however, because I'll be<br />\nlending my usually biased opinions to the ol'Flipside on a more<br />\nor less regular basis. For now,<br />\nhowever, let's scope the scene.<br />\nOkay, well, this past weekend<br />\nwas a hoot. Following the suggestions of my more counter-culture<br />\noriented friends, I decided to<br />\ncheck out the happenings at The<br />\nMaryland Institute of Art, located<br />\njust over North Avenue on Mount<br />\nRoyal. Just head down Howard<br />\ntill you cross over North Ave,<br />\nthen go across the bridge and<br />\nmake a left on Mt. Royal. When<br />\nyou start seeing strange people<br />\ndressed in black, you're there.<br />\nSo anyway, Saturday night a<br />\ncarload of us headed down there<br />\nto check out this film Pym,<br />\ndirected by some local amateur,<br /><br />\nand to check out this party being<br />\nheld afterwards. I was a little put<br />\noff at first, because the film sucked. Maybe I'm just stupid, but<br />\nafter enduring a Mark Miller film<br />\nclass, I think I know a little about<br />\nfilm. This sucker was completely incoherent to everybody I was<br />\nwith, and I think anybody who<br />\ncould make sense of it was lying.<br />\nWorse yet, it had all the marks of<br />\nbeing an attempt at arty filmmaking, with lots of fast intercutting and 'heavily symbolic'<br />\nshots.<br />\nThis all came to an end around<br />\n9 p.m., and we wandered over to<br />\nthe main building where the party was being held. Being so early, no one was there yet, and the<br />\nband was still soundchecking, so<br />\nwe all grabbed a beer and went<br />\nto the downstairs lounge. At the<br />\nMIA, the downstairs lounge is<br />\nequivalent to the kitchen at<br />\nregular parties\u2014it's the place to<br />\ngo to be cool. After a little while<br />\nwe could hear the opening band<br />\nstart up, and headed upstairs.<br />\nOne thing about an MIA<br /><br />\nparty\u2014you'll see more interesting<br />\nlooking people in one night there<br />\nthan you'll ever see in your whole<br />\nHopkins career. The security<br />\npeople looked like the kind of<br />\npeople we try to keep out, and<br />\nsince the party was open to the<br />\npublic, there was a constant<br />\nparade of humanity coming<br />\nthrough the front door,<br />\neverything from chickenhawks to<br />\nskins to Maryland yucks\u2014not a<br />\nscene for the faint of heart, or the<br />\nnaive and uninitiated, but a lot of<br />\nfun nonetheless. Most importantly for us guys (all you hard-core<br />\nfeminists skip this part, 'cause<br />\nyou're gonna get pissed off),<br />\nthere was a constant flow of attractive, decently intelligent<br />\nyoung ladies who would actually<br />\nspeak to you. After two and a half<br />\nyears of the social tundra that is<br />\nHopkins, this was like a night in<br />\nparadise.<br />\nAlso quite important was the<br />\nfact that the MIA has some decent<br />\ntaste in music. The headlining<br />\nband, Instant Siberia, sounded a<br />\nbit like The Cure probably<br /><br />\nwould've sounded if they were<br />\nAmerican. Strike a few points for<br />\na less than totally original sound,<br />\nbut they still laid down a mean<br />\nparty groove of original tunes that<br />\nI was more than happy to semipogo to. As for the opening band,<br />\nOne Word, I can only think of<br />\none word to describe them: good.<br />\nBoasting a dual drum set, these<br />\nguys put down some funkiness<br />\nrather reminiscent of The Red<br />\nHot Chili Peppers (and I'm not<br />\njust saying that because the<br />\nbassist looked like Mike B. the<br />\nFlea). The bands were good, the<br />\naudience loved it (this was the<br />\nkind of crowd that starts to undress when it gets warm on the<br />\ndance floor), and I can't say that<br />\nI ever got really bored. All for<br />\nfive bucks (the film cost three)<br />\nnot counting beer (Natty Boh<br />\ngoes for $1, making it twice as<br />\nexpensive as your average Hop<br />\nevent beer). Overall, I can sum<br />\nit up this way: After two and a<br />\nhalf years of bland, white-bread<br />\nHop events, I've finally found a<br />\nvirtual deli of a cultural scene.<br /><br />\nFlips/des of Summer<br />\nRefined...<br />\nby John Park<br />\n1967 had the summer of love,<br />\n1988 had the summer of blips,<br />\n.beeps, and booms. While there<br />\nwere no \"Pump Up the<br />\nVolume' s this year, the sampling and hacking of soundmasters<br />\nColdcut Bomb the Bass, eta!continued unabated in the clubs, so<br />\nmuch so that out of sheer<br />\nboredom, I sought something a<br />\nlittle more organic, music made<br />\nof thought, not manipulation.<br />\nI managed to uncover at least<br />\ntwo seminal recordings, the first<br />\nof which, Kip Hanrahan's Days<br />\nand Nights ofBlue Lurk Inverted,<br />\nbridges the nearly two-and-a-half<br />\nyears of silence since his fantastic<br />\nVertical's Currency (like Days,<br />\nalso to be reissued on the new<br />\nSting/Miles Copeland label,<br />\nPangaea).<br />\nHanrahan has always floated<br />\nsomewhere on the fringe of New<br />\nYork's \"avant-hipster\" scene, a<br />\nself-proclaimed \"musical conceptualist,\" and with Days he<br />\npaints an incisive portrait of every<br />\naffair that ever began in wine and<br />\nended in whisky. (An excerpt<br />\nfrom the inner sleeve: \"He once<br />\nloved this woman. And they<br />\nmade love so hard the walls<br />\nwould sweat. And the bed would<br />\nbreak to pieces and the light<br />\nwould fall away. He didn't know<br />\nif she made love that way out of<br />\nanger or joy, and the way he<br />\ndidn't understand it was the way<br />\nhe was driven to love her so<br />\nhard.\" Get the picture?).<br />\nIt's a sultry, suave combination<br />\nof ballad sax and latin rhythms,<br />\nmoody lyrics and azure voices, a<br />\nsemi-autobiggraphical detailing<br />\nof Hanrahan's relationship with<br />\nhis wife, Nancy. It's an album<br />\nwhose poetic rhetoric is so<br /><br />\ncentered and strong that<br />\nHanrahan can weave a doubletake lyric like \" The same way<br />\nPalestine refuses to disappear<br />\nfrom the map/is the same way I<br />\nam going to refuse to disappear<br />\nfrom your heart\" seamlessly between a fitful bass and raindrop<br />\ncongas.<br />\nToo, the pure musical virtuosity here is startling. Hanrahan has<br />\nassembled a large cast of New<br />\nYork's best session musicians(he<br />\nformed roughly three overlapping<br />\nbands) including Milton Cardona,<br />\nAnton Fier, Jack Bruce,<br />\nGentleman John Stubblefield, and<br />\nthey play unhurriedly, with<br />\nsincere inspiration. Of the<br />\nalubums twelve songs, not one<br />\nruns sour, although side two,<br />\nwith especially brilliant tracks<br />\nlike, \"Ah intruder (female),\"<br />\n\"Lisbon; blue request,\" and<br />\n\"The first and last to love me(2,<br />\nDecember)\" strikes me as being<br />\nslightly more cohesive and wellcomposed.

I don't know<br />\nexactly what it means, except,<br />\nEssential.<br />\nLikewise, from the smart,<br />\ntailored suits sported by bandmen<br />\nPaul Weller and Mick Talbot on<br />\nthe album sleeve to the music on<br />\nthe vinyl within, The Style Council's lastest, Confessions ofa Pop<br />\nGroup, impresses me with its<br />\nwholly classic aesthetic and attention to detail. While listening to<br />\nthe opening numbers, \"Life at a<br />\nTop People's Health Farm,\"<br />\n\"Why I Went Missing,\" and<br />\n\"How She Threw it All Away,\"<br />\nI was impressed most by the<br />\nband's genuine pop sensibilities,<br />\ntheir subtle sonic flairs, and their<br />\nuncompromising dedication to<br />\ncomposing these songs as songs<br />\nand not as vehicles for political<br />\nrhetoric, a problem which had<br />\noften dulled earlier efforts.<br />\nMusically, the influences here<br />\nare eclectic, ranging from the Im-<br /><br />\npressionistic piano of Satie to the<br />\nbreezy and polished styles of Sixties Stan Getz and Modern Jazz<br />\nQuartet; side two (\"The Piano<br />\nPaintings\") is a virtually pastoral,<br />\nsurprisingly effective melding of<br />\njazz and classical styles. The<br />\nCouncillors remain true to their<br />\nbop and Stax roots, however, on<br />\nside one (\"Confessions of a Pop<br />\nGroup\") as the horns play with<br />\ncatchy snap and tight precision<br />\nalongside Mick Talbots near freeform Hammond Organ. Lyrically, Paul Weller continues to lean<br />\ntowards the overtly \"socially<br />\naware,\" and to that end there is<br />\na sincere pathos working here<br />\nwhich was sometimes overwrought or underdeveloped<br />\npreviously; many of his lyrics,<br />\nthough hardly poetry, are written<br />\nwith an honesty and wisdom that<br />\npop in the Eighties could do well<br />\nto receive.<br /><br />\nprised at my eclectic and diverse<br />\ntastes.<br />\nIggy Pop-Instinct. Oh, Iggy,<br />\nwhat have you done? First you<br />\nmeet Bowie, then you get clean<br />\nand start turning out stuff like<br />\nBlah, Blah, Blah, which was exactly that. While Instinct isn't that<br />\nbad and is salvaged by some fairly muscular work-outs on the<br />\nlikes of\"Tom-Tom\" and \"Cold<br />\nMetal,\" the whole metal approach is kind of boring, as is Iggy's post-Bowie croon. Sad to<br />\nsay, Steve Jones was a more exciting guitarist when he didn't<br />\nknow what he was doing, and Iggy was better as freaked-out Jim<br />\nMorrison groupie.

Although Hopkins usually ranks among the Centennial<br />\nConference leaders in offense,<br />\nthe Blue Jays switched to a<br />\nwishbone to capitalize on their<br />\ntremendous depth and experience<br />\nat running back. Though it may<br />\nhave seemed like a logical choice<br />\nat the time, the Hopkins coaches<br />\nmust be having second thoughts<br />\nas the Jays prepare for their home<br />\nopener tonight. The wishbone has<br />\nonly managed 106 yeards on 67<br />\ncarries in the first two games, and<br />\nHopkins has only scored nine<br />\npoints. Though the defense has<br />\nplayed extremely well, they<br />\nhaven't been able to save the Jays<br />\nfrom going 0-2.<br />\nThe Blue Jays could have won<br />\ntheir season opener at Catholic<br />\nUniversity. The offense was<br />\ngiven excellent field position early in the game, and the defense<br />\nwas having no problem handling<br />\nthe Cardinals' potent passing attack. Yet, as they did so many<br />\ntimes last year, the Blue Jays<br />\ncommitted key turnovers and failed to convert on scoring opportunities. The result was an<br />\nopening-day loss to a team that<br />\nthey should have beaten.<br />\nThe Blue Jays clearly had the<br />\nmomentum in the first quarter, as<br />\nsome excellent defense and solid<br />\npunting by Gary Rupert kept<br />\nCatholic pinned near their own<br />\nend zone. When Joe Sokolowski<br />\nrecovered a Drew Komlo fumble<br />\nat the CUA 25, the Hopkins<br />\nwishbone was handed a golden<br />\nopportunity to notch the first<br />\npoints of the season. With Rupert<br />\nat quarterback, the wishbone<br />\npounded the ball inside the Cardinal 10-yard line. On a fourthand-six, Coach Jerry Pfeifer<br />\ndecided to try for the first down<br />\ninstead of kicking the field goal,<br />\nbut the CUA defense held and<br />\ntook possession at the 7.<br />\nThe Hopkins defense again<br />\nfrustrated the Cardinals and forced them to punt out of their own<br />\nend zone. With junior Eric<br />\nTrenaman at quarterback, the<br />\nBlue Jays put together a nice<br />\ndrive, highlighted by a 16-yard<br /><br />\nrun by Chris Chirieleison.<br />\nTrenaman then hit sophomore<br />\nChris Ogeneski for a 10-yard<br />\nscoring pass to put Hopkins ahead<br />\n6-0.<br />\nThe next time Hopkins got the<br />\nball, the momentum began to shift<br />\ntoward CUA. Trenaman underthrew his receiver, and the Cardinals' Bill Doyle made a spectacular one-handed interception.<br />\nCatholic then put together an impressive drive led by Komlo, considered one of the finest quarterbacks in Division III football. He<br />\npicked away at the Blue Jays<br />\ndefense with short passes, driving his team from their own 8 to<br />\nthe Hopkins 25. The Jays then appeared to stop the Cardinals on a<br />\nfourth-and-two play, but a<br />\nroughing-the-passer penalty gave<br />\nthe ball back to CUA. Komlo<br />\nthen connected with Jeff Boyer on<br />\na 5-yard TD strike, and the extrapoint put Catholic ahead 7-6.<br />\nWith the momentum gone, the<br />\nHopkins offense began to<br />\nflounder. The wishbone became<br />\n'ineffective as the Blue Jays used<br />\nthe fullback option almost every<br />\nplay. When the quarterback did<br />\nrollout, it usually resulted in a<br />\nfumble. Brock Bowman, who<br />\nbecame the third Hopkins<br />\nquarterback of the afternoon,<br />\nmissed Brian Dulin on the<br />\nhalfback option early in the third<br />\nquarter, and Catholic recovered<br />\nthe fumble on the Jays' 3-yard<br />\nline. The tough Hopkins defense<br />\nagain refused to yield, as Jeff<br />\nSheaffer saved a touchdown by<br />\nputting a tremendous hit on Cardinals' receiver Mike Patronik in<br />\nthe end zone. CUA had to settle<br />\nfor a field goal and a 10-6 lead.<br />\nThe bright spot for the Blue<br />\nJays was definitely the defense,<br />\nwhich kept Hopkins in the game<br />\ndespite five key turnovers.<br />\nLinebackers Steve Davis, Charles<br />\nJohnson-Bey, Larry Rytel, and<br />\nMike Fenzel kept Drew Komlo in<br />\ncheck all afternoon as they accounted for twenty solo tackles.<br />\nJoe Sokolowski, spectacular at<br />\nmonster back, had two sacks and<br />\nsix tackles.<br />\n\"Joe's a real hitter, an enforcer,\" commented Coach<br />\nPfeifer. \"When he catches a guy<br />\nright, he puts him out of the<br />\ngame.\"<br /><br />\nThe offensive line will have it's work cut out for it against FDU<br /><br />\nGary Rupert (above) will get the starting nod at QB tonight<br />\nThe big question marks for the<br />\nHopkins offense sputtered, and<br />\nJays were on offense, most<br />\nthe Jays fell to 0-2 despite an exspecifically at quarterback.

Tonight<br />\nat 7:30, Hopkins will host<br />\nFairleigh Dickinson (Madison)<br />\nunder the lights at Homewood<br />\nField. The Jersey Devils are<br />\nperhaps the biggest and quickest<br />\nteam on the Blue Jays schedule,<br />\nand they are flying high after an<br />\nopening 14-3 victory over Jersey<br />\nCity State. The Devils field an<br />\nFile photo<br /><br />\nFile photo<br /><br />\nawesome defensive unit led by<br />\njunior linebacker John Clarke and<br />\nsophomore Glenn Kipila, a 6'6\u2014,<br />\n280 pound tackle who racked up<br />\nfour quarterback sacks in the<br />\nseason opener.<br />\nLast year, the Devils held<br />\nHopkins to 0 yards rushing and<br />\n129 yards passing in route to a<br />\n14-7 wins. The game will probably be a tremendous defensive<br />\nbattle, unless the Jays can find a<br />\nleader at quarterback. Senior<br />\nGary Rupert will get the starting<br />\nnod, and Coach Pfeifer is hoping<br />\nthat his experience will help spark<br />\nthe struggling offense. Hopkins<br />\nneeds to find a reliable quarterback to run their offense, and<br />\nthey need to find him quickly.<br />\n\"The starting quarterback<br />\nwon't be the guy who makes the<br />\nbig play. It will be the guy who<br />\navoids the bad play.\" said<br />\nPfeifer.<br />\nIf they can find that guy, the<br />\nBlue Jays are capable of winning<br />\nfive or six games this season. If<br />\nthey don't, they may be in for<br />\nmore frustrating losses like the<br />\nfirst two.<br />\nNOTES: Brian Dulin is the<br />\nleading Hopkins rusher after the<br />\nfirst two games with 71 yards on<br />\n19 carries.

According to coach Sally Beth<br />\nAnderson, \"we played hockey<br />\nlike we are capable of.

The<br />\nLady Jays had more shots-on-goal<br />\nthan Gettysburg, but still lost<br />\nbecause their playing wasn't up to<br />\npar. According to captain Jackie<br />\nFatula, \"We just didn't perform<br />\nas well as we could have.

Even<br />\nthough the game was played in a<br />\nheavy downpour, the Lady Jays<br />\nplayed exceptionally well, with<br />\nCoach Anderson describing the<br />\ngame as an \"impressive<br />\nvictory.\"<br />\nAnderson, who is in her<br />\nseventh year of coaching field<br />\nhockey at Hopkins, hopes to improve on last year's record-setting<br />\nseason in which Hopkins amassed an impressive 14-3-1 record.<br />\nThe 63 goals scored last season<br />\nwere the greatest goal output ever<br />\nby a Hopkins team, while the<br />\ndefense, anchored by goalie Jennifer O'Hara, allowed only 13<br />\ngoals. The Jays' season ended in<br />\na 3-2 double overtime loss to<br />\nDrew University in the first<br />\nround of the MAC playoffs.<br />\nThis year's squad is led by a<br />\npair of senior co-captains, Jackie<br />\nFatula at forward and Kathy Hart<br />\nat center midfield.

Despite their most recent<br />\nloss to Western Maryland 0-3,<br />\nHopkins can boast of some promising statistics, including three<br />\nkills, three aces, sixty-one digs,<br />\nand five blocks in nine attempts.<br />\nThe 1988 squad is fortunate in<br />\nmany ways. For instance, the acquisition of a new varsity coach,<br />\nthe return of nine athletes, and the<br />\narrival of two new strong<br />\nfreshman should allow the Lady<br />\nJays to continue their upward<br />\nmomentum. Coach Bill Jones, a<br />\nformer assistant coach at Notre<br />\nDame, brings with him both college coaching experience and the<br />\nexperience of coaching five years<br />\nat the high school level. Jones has<br />\na very positive attitude about his<br />\nteam and their prospects this<br />\nseason. \"My goal is to maintain<br />\nthe momentum that [former<br />\ncoach] Dawn Finnessey started<br />\nand better last season's 8-12<br />\nrecord. In the short term, I hope<br />\nto work on developing consistency in play,\" Jones stated.<br /><br />\nThe Lady Jays have nine returning players, including seven<br />\nfrom last year's 8-12 team and<br />\ntwo former players. Ashi Rafi,<br />\nPatrina Hsi, Jill Kness, Beth<br />\nMonahan, Angela Muras, Dawn<br />\nNee, and Rochelle Payne are<br />\nback from last fall, while Joy<br />\nBoyer and Alison Unger are back<br />\non the squad after taking a year<br />\noff. Muras, a strong hitter, and<br />\nMonahan, an effective middle<br />\nblocker, should prove to be<br />\nstrong players for the varsity this<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe team has been blessed this<br />\nyear with the arrival of two<br />\nfreshmen, both of whom are<br />\nstarters this season. Trang Phain,<br />\nof Rockville H.S. in Rockville,<br />\nMD, and Jennifer Kishimoni, of<br />\nSan Francisco, both \"have a lot<br />\nof potential, great ability, and<br />\nknowledge of the game,\" according to Coach Jones. Pham, a<br />\n5'5\" setter, is an experienced<br />\nplayer with hitting ability, while<br />\nKishimoni is both an effective setter and hitter.<br />\nCo-captain Boyer thinks that<br />\n\"with most of the starters returning and a few new additions, including a great new coach, we<br />\nshould have a really good<br />\nseason.\" This attitude is echoed<br /><br />\nby Coach Jones, in realizing that,<br />\n\"when we play our best, we can<br />\nbeat anyone.\"<br />\nThe Lady Jays' next game is at<br />\nTuesday,<br />\nDickinson, on<br />\nSeptember 27.
