President Gordon was out of<br />\ntown.<br />\nThe protestors focused their<br />\nconcern on the University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Silver<br />\nSpring, Md. They demanded:<br />\n1.

Why they?<br />\nWhy not people who are affected by what<br />\nthe Lab does?\"<br />\nGordon's letter responded to the Committee's proposals, declaring them to be<br />\nincompatible with one another. One proposal was for the University's termina'tion of its agreement with the Navy,which<br />\nowns all of the equipment at the Lab.<br />\nAnother was for the exclusion of classified defense research in favor of social<br />\nresearch.<br />\nGordon pointed out that if the Lab does<br />\nnot do work for the Navy, it will not have<br />\nthe equipment to carry on any kind of research at all, social or othewise.<br />\nGordon's letter also made note. of<br />\n<br />\nthe Student Council's suggestions last<br />\nMay for re-evaluation of APL prioriHe outlined the exchanges that<br />\nties.<br />\nhad taken place among the Council, representatves of the APL senior staff<br />\nand Advisory staff, and himself.<br />\nA spokesman for the Committee on<br />\nAPL commented, \"Gordon's letter basically says, 'Listen you guys, a year ago<br />\nI told the Student Council that the Trustees and I wouldn't do anything about<br />\nAPL, so why should I listen to you?'<br />\nGordon suggests that we go through the<br />\nStudent Council. If that wasn't pathetic,<br />\n<br />\nit would be funny.\"<br />\nThe letter recalled vigorous objections made in the past by himself and<br />\nby APL representatives to the political<br />\nand moral judgment expressed in \"Use<br />\nor Abuse,\" a pamphlet published by the<br />\nCommittee for APL.<br />\n<br />\nWar Is Wrong<br />\nAccording to a Committee spokesman,<br />\n\"The only moral judgment in the pamphlet is against the Vietnam War.

I'd like to<br />\nknow why it's on this campus and what<br />\nthey do here.\"<br />\nWith these words, APL Committee leader Jim Keogh, speaking from the steps<br />\n<br />\nof Levering, announced his intention to<br />\nspeak to the ONR representative in Barton Hall a venture which proved unKeogh had just learned of<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nthe whereabouts of the ONR office; as<br />\nlate as Sunday night he thought the office was located in Whitehead Hall.<br />\n<br />\nThe climax of the whole \"field trip,\"<br />\nas Keogh called it, came when the elevator opended on the first floor. Instead<br />\nof an open space, the doors revealed a<br />\nsteel wall. This produced the biggest<br />\nlaught of the day.<br />\n<br />\nKeogh quickly established the tone of<br />\nMonday's investigation when he invited<br />\npassers-by to \"Join the navy, fight inthe<br />\nternational communism and see<br />\nworld.\"<br />\n<br />\nLater, an employee upstairs explained<br />\nthat the outer steel door often doesn't open<br />\nwhen the elevator is over-crowded. \"Apparently you don't have to be subversive<br />\nto have this happen to you,\" Pfeffer cracked.<br />\nThere was some indication that noon had<br />\nbeen picked as the best time to begin the<br />\nInvestigation so that students could be<br />\n*settled in the ONR office when the representative returned from lunch. But Barton<br />\nHall employees thought it unlikely that he<br />\nwould come back that afternoon. The students decided to break up and to go to<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThe Committee has no plans for another<br />\ninvestigation in the future. \"I had a good<br />\ntime,' Keogh said, \"and if I really want to<br />\nfind out something, there's better ways<br />\nthan coining with twenty people.\"<br />\n<br />\nEmpty Office<br />\n<br />\nLocal campus activists went on an unsuccessful foray Monday to locate the Office of Naval<br />\nResearch on campus.<br />\n<br />\nAt about 12:45, p.m. a group of fifteen<br />\nwalked over to Barton Hall and crowded<br />\ninto the elevator to ride up to the fourth<br />\nfloor. Finding that room 403, the ONR<br />\noffice was empty, the group decided to<br />\nask a secretary downstairs if the representative would be in that afternoon.<br />\nOn the way down one student called Professor Rick Pfeffer on the elevator phone.<br />\nThe group detoured to his office on the<br />\nsecond floor and persuaded him to join<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\nSubversives<br />\n<br />\nAbolition Discussion Fails Claude Brown Charges Conspiracy<br />\nBy Police and Federal Authorities<br />\nTo Affect Vote Turnout<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\n23.

Then,<br />\nthe SMC stepped in, and against the advice of local organizers, planned a march from Hopkins to the rally site for 10<br />\nA.M., conflicting with the vigil.<br />\nThe rally failed, not only because of the weather and<br />\ninterfactional mismanagement, but also because people are<br />\nsimply tired of rallies. increasingly; things are polarizing<br />\nwithin the movement. People are either opting for violence or going out and working for a candidate. Peaceful<br />\nstreet protests are quickly becoming a thing of the past.<br />\nThere were no businessmen to be seen at the rally in<br />\nBaltimore, and few at those in other parts of the country.<br />\nThis, even though the theme of the moratorium--linking<br />\nhigh taxes to the war\u2014was aimed at them. As one frustrated local organizer stated, the Moratorium is \"not getting<br />\nthe older people on the streets like it used to.\"<br />\nAt Berkeley, students split into small groups for<br />\nWeatherman-style back street activities.

The University, which<br />\nclaims involvement with the city that surrounds it and<br />\npoints with pride to the civic projects of its students,<br />\nturns around and tells a Washington church that it must<br />\ncome up with $6000 rent or watch its civic projects be<br />\nturned into a parking lot.<br />\nSt. Margaret's Episcopal church and a large group of<br />\nconcerned citizens, including students from American University, have invested a great deal of time and money fixing up what were but a few months ago vandal-destroyed<br />\nbuildings. Yet every six months they face the possibility<br />\nof seeing their work fall to the bulldozers unless they can<br />\nraise the $1000 per month demanded by their landlord,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nIf Hopkins is truly concerned with the plight of the<br />\ninner city, if it actually wants to better the community<br />\nwhich surrounds it, here is an excellent opportunity to<br />\nshow it. All involved with the projects claim that the rent<br />\nis too high, while one would assume that an idealistic<br />\nUniversity would charge such a worthy tenant a rent<br />\nsubstantially below the community average. In fact it<br />\nwould seem that Hopkins should jump at the opportunity<br />\nto help by simply allowing these people to use unused<br />\nbuildings.

It will<br />\nbe recalled that the evident intention of the administration to lodge large numbers of female undergraduates in McCoy for an indefinite period was the<br />\noriginal cause of rent strike agitation. This was<br />\nnot a selfish issue, since the plan was also opposed by undergraduates and seemed to be contrary to the interests of the women themselves.<br />\nIn any case, if the current recommendation of<br />\nDean Swanson is implemented, the residence of<br />\nundergraduate females in McCoy will last for<br />\nonly one year, until girls are admitted into the<br />\nfreshman class, and the conversion of dormitory spaces becomes feasible. The number of<br />\nfemale undergraduate transfers living in McCoy<br />\nnext year is now expected to be small: 25-35.<br />\nIf the number seeking housing turns out to be<br />\nmuch larger, an effort will supossedly be made<br />\nto find dormitory space for women for the coming year.<br />\nOn this issue, there now seems little to do but<br />\nwait and test the administration's intentions.<br />\nAction may be necessary at some future date,<br />\nbut I suspect that the female undergraduates<br />\nwill themselves reject permanent residence in<br />\nMcCoy, once they have established themselves<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nSecond, the objections to the 5% rent increase<br />\nand the abolition of switchboard service have<br />\n<br />\nalways been somewhat tenuous. In view of the<br />\ngeneral inflation and the recent wage increases<br />\nat Hopkins, the argument that the costs of graduate housing have increased must be accepted,<br />\nuntil someone launches a study of administration<br />\nefficiency. To argue that the university should<br />\ndivert funds from other activities to subsidize<br />\ngraduate housing is obviously divisive and not<br />\nconstructive. In some departments, graduate<br />\nfellowhip stipends have been increased to meet<br />\ninflationary pressures, and this would seem the<br />\nmore appropriate remedy for graduate students<br />\nto seek. Such increases may mean fewer new<br />\ngraduate students, but in view of the current<br />\njob market, a reduction may be necessary anyway.<br />\nAs for switchboard service, a study conducted<br />\nby students last year revealed widespread dissatisfaction with the service, and it is clear that<br />\nmany students would rather take their chances<br />\nwith party lines, pay phones and private homes.<br />\nIf the university could work out an insurance<br />\nprogram with the phone company to avoid the<br />\nnecessity of deposits, this complaint would soon<br />\nfade away.<br />\nFor these reasons, I am no longer prepared<br />\nto sacrifice the great amount of time which<br />\nwould be required to organize and co-ordinate<br />\na rent strike. If someone else should wish to<br />\nmake this sacrifice, I will gladly make available to him all information that I have on the<br />\nissue.<br />\nRaymond W.

But,<br />\nthey're a bore because even the<br />\nmost unartistic among us have<br />\nsuffered the trials of puberty,<br />\n<br />\nadolesence and post-adolescent<br />\nstruggles to the extent the authors have.

A penalty<br />\nprone defense could hurt but Hopkins has not scored well in oneman up situations so far this year.<br />\nVirginia usually runs three<br />\nmidfields, with Jim Potter and<br />\nDick Proutt handling most of the<br />\nfaceoff chores for the Cavaliers.<br />\nSo far this season Proutt and<br />\nPotter have controlled about two<br />\nof their faceoffs.

Against the Alumni last Sunday,<br />\nBeach had three goals.<br />\nAnother big threat on the offense for U. Va. is freshman<br />\nTom Duquette.

In four<br />\n<br />\ngames, the freshman standout<br />\nhas nine goals and ten assists,<br />\nwhich shows his versatility as<br />\nboth a scorer and feeder. Last<br />\nSunday, he led the Cavalier scorers with four goals.<br />\nThe third Cavalier attackman<br />\nis sophomore Jay Connor. Connor missed the opened against<br />\nMount Washington, but in the<br />\nthree games since, he has scored<br />\n5 goals and has been credited<br />\nwith 5 assists. Alongwith Beach,<br />\nhe had 3 goals against U Va.'s<br />\nalumni.<br />\nOne has to give the edge to<br />\nthe Blue Jays who command a 5-0<br />\nrecord and a six game win streak.<br />\nVirginia has not beaten a Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team since 1963, and<br />\nthe last time they won at.Charlottesville was in 1953.

Virginia should be competitive in the Mid-Eastern Division this year. Last year, the<br />\nCavaliers came to Homewood<br />\nconfident and cocky. Their 15-4<br />\nloss to hopkins last year, plus<br />\nlast week's preview should stymie any such feelings this year.<br />\nObservers who have seen both<br />\nclub in action this season favor<br />\nHopkins. 12-10.

The<br />\nmarchers, about one hundred strong,<br />\nwere almost all Baltimore high school<br />\nstudents, many of whom said they risked<br />\ndisciplinary<br />\nmeasures for skipping<br />\nclasses. The march was the Mobe's first<br />\nforay into Baltimore anti-war activites.<br />\nA platform and sound system were<br />\nthen set up in the shelter of the walkway<br />\nin preparation for the noon rally. Lance<br />\nYateman, a Moratorium organizer, told<br />\nthe demonstrators that although it was<br />\nstill raining, \"spiritually the sun's out.\"<br />\n\"Nixon had better listen to us,\" said<br />\nYateman. \"The next time a Nixon or a<br />\nJohnson decides to hold a war in Asia,<br />\nain't nobody comin'.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe rally began with a speech by Charlotte Mitten, Chairman of the Baltimore<br />\nWelfare Rights Organization. In keeping<br />\nwith the Moratorium's April theme, she<br />\nexhorted the government to \"bring the<br />\nmoney home.\" Arguing that the Federal<br />\nGovernment didn't care about ghetto children until they reached draft age, Mrs.<br />\nMitten urged the establishment of a guaranteed annual income to enable poor children to receive decent education and<br />\nhousing.<br />\n<br />\nLeaflet VFW<br />\nRobert B.Johnson of the Maryland Veterans for Peace claimed that \"the enemy<br />\nIs ignorance\" and that the ugly truth about<br />\nthe Vietnam war must be brought home to<br />\nthe \"Silent Majority.\" \"If you want to<br />\npass out a leaflet, go to the Veterans of<br />\nForeign Wars,go to the American Legion,<br />\ngo to middle America,\" urged Johnson.<br />\nParen Mitchell,the Associate Director<br />\nof the Urban Studies Institute at Morgan<br />\nState College, called for an attack upon<br />\nthe institutions that are responsible for<br />\nVietnam and for the ghettos -- militarism<br />\nand racism. Commented Mitchell, \"As<br />\nwe unleash the capacity to kill in Vietnam,<br />\nwe maximize the possibility of violence<br />\nhere at home.\"<br />\n<br />\nTheme of Day's Actions<br />\n<br />\nRepression in the US was attacked by<br />\nWalter Carter. Claiming that \"strict<br />\nconstructionism is 1970 Ku Klux Klanism,\" Carter relegated present US foreign and domestic policies to the 1940's<br />\n<br />\nera.<br />\n\"We in Baltimore are much worse than<br />\nthe Federal Government in repression,\"<br />\nput forth Carter. \"We've got a war on<br />\npoverty but the only war that is being<br />\nwaged is against the poverty-stricken.\"<br />\nPresent at the rally were several FBI<br />\nagents and police photographers as well<br />\nas a detail of Baltimore policemen led by<br />\nMajor Schnabel, who supervised the Customs House arrests last month.<br />\n<br />\nCrowd at the Moratorium rally at Federal Plaza Wednesday.

He is considered politically left of Mandel. The<br />\nprimary is in September.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the staunchest opponents to the<br />\nliberalized abortion law is Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle, Archbishop of Washington.<br />\nShriver is in O'Boyle's archdiocese.<br />\n<br />\n\\sr<br />\n<br />\n. Equal to Alcohol<br />\n<br />\n-Get Out\"<br />\nHe told the audience that he was infavor<br />\n\"of getting out of Vietnam on a timetable right away and completely,\" although he refused to support the Moratorium movement.<br />\n\"No, I won't be attending the Moratorium. I had planned tomorrow to be<br />\nin Washington to see a few people,\" he<br />\nremarked. Instead, he visited Montgomery County and the Hopkins Drug Abuse<br />\nCenter Wednesday.<br />\nConcerning the emotion-laden abortion<br />\nlaw now before the Governor, Shriver<br />\nstated that if he were Mandel he would<br />\nsign the bill and recommend it be presented in a referendum to the electorate.<br />\n<br />\nSargent Shriver: \"I have an open<br />\nmind on the legalization of marijuana.He added though, \"I wouldn't have this<br />\nbill on my desk because I wouldhave<br />\nspent quite a bit of time trying to get a<br />\nmuch more comprehensive bill enacted<br />\ninto law.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe former Ambassador to France and<br />\nhis wife are Catholic. His and his wife's<br />\nown moral principles, he explained, forbid abortion \"as a method of solving<br />\nHowever, he noted,<br />\nsocial problems.\"<br />\n\"I wouldn't try to impose my moral<br />\nprinciples on others.\"<br />\n<br />\nMarijuana, Shriver commented, \"is no<br />\nbetter or worst than alcohol or tobacco.\"<br />\nWhile condemning the \"double-standard\"<br />\nbetween drinks and drugs, he stated he has<br />\n\"an open mind\" on the marijuana question.<br />\nPrefacing these remarks, though, was<br />\nan angry denunciation of hard-drug pushers. \"I hate to say this..but I would want<br />\nto kill any pusher I saw selling heroin to<br />\nmy son. I would rather he kill him than<br />\nsell him that stuff,\" Shriver declared.<br />\nHis position on the Calvert Cliffs dispute centered on ending the construction<br />\nof the nuclear power plant until its effect<br />\non the Chesapeake Bay is studied.<br />\nHowever, Shriver expressed sympathy<br />\nfor the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. \"I am told that to stop the construction of the installation at this time<br />\nmight bring serious, if not irreparable<br />\ndamage to the company.\" If this is the<br />\ncase, Shriver implied that a financial<br />\nreimbursement would be in order.<br />\nProceeding into the area of the Negro<br />\nand the poor, Shriver said, \"I think that<br />\nthe first thing that all people deserve is<br />\nequality of treatment and equality before<br />\nthe law.\"<br />\n\"We've got to make an extra effort to<br />\ncorrect the imbalances of the past,\"<br />\nhe added.<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nSomeone's Thing to Share<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br />\n<br />\nTHE SEED OF DISCOVERY WAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\nCOFFEE HOUSE<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n236 E. 25 St.<br />\n243-9234<br />\n<br />\n467-2123<br />\n<br />\nBooks - Ilsed (V.

What are<br />\nthe functional relations between<br />\nmother and fetus?<br />\nThese and other questions are<br />\nbeing intensively studied on a<br />\nremote corner of the Homewood<br />\ncampus by a group which, on<br />\npaper at least, has nothing to<br />\ndo with Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nresearchers are all staff members of the Carnegie Institution<br />\nof Washington, and their building is the modern glass-andconcrete one northwest of the<br />\nROTC building.<br />\nThe Carnegie Institute is a<br />\nfar-flung, privately endowed research organization, with six<br />\nessentially autonomous departments stretching from New York<br />\nto California. The one in Baltimore is the Department of Embryology.<br />\n\"We are conceuned primarily<br />\nwith basic research,\" explained<br />\nDr. James Ebert, director of<br />\nthe department, \"but we have<br />\nalways had a mixture of M.D.'s<br />\nand Ph.D.'s, and practicality is<br />\none of our watchwords.\"<br />\nHe<br />\nnoted that much of the original<br />\nwork which went into the development of both the birth control pill and the intra-uterine<br />\ndevice (IUD) was done at the lab.<br />\nEbert listed the three fields<br />\nwhich the researchers are'presently investigating as human<br />\n<br />\nembryology, experimental embryology and the physiology of<br />\nreproduction. In the past the<br />\nlab also did work on organ transplantation, but the research has<br />\ntemporarily been stopped. \"If<br />\nwe get any new ideas, we may<br />\npick up on that again,\" Ebert<br />\ncommented.<br />\nThe Institution was founded by<br />\nAndrew Carnegie in 1902. The<br />\nEmbryology Department was established in 1913 by Dr. Franklin Mall, a professor of Anatomy<br />\nat Hopkins.. It originally inhabited a building on the corner<br />\nof Wolfe and Madison Streets,<br />\nand moved to its present location in 1962. The Institution<br />\nnegotiated a 99-year lease with<br />\nthe University, after which time<br />\nthe building reverts to Hopkins.<br />\nEmbryology, one of the smallest of the departments, has a<br />\ncore staff of only eight permanent members. Besides these,<br />\nthere are 16 other spaces for<br />\nsenior<br />\nvisiting investigators,<br />\ngraduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br />\nIn addition to researchers, the<br />\nlab contains the world's largest<br />\ncollection of human embryos-10,000--as well as rabbits, rats,<br />\nmice, hamsters, guinea pigs,<br />\nfrogs, toads, chickens, worms<br />\nand silkworms.

President Gordon was out of<br />\ntown.<br />\nThe protestors focused their<br />\nconcern on the University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Silver<br />\nSpring, Md. They demanded:<br />\n1.

Why they?<br />\nWhy not people who are affected by what<br />\nthe Lab does?\"<br />\nGordon's letter responded to the Committee's proposals, declaring them to be<br />\nincompatible with one another. One proposal was for the University's termina'tion of its agreement with the Navy,which<br />\nowns all of the equipment at the Lab.<br />\nAnother was for the exclusion of classified defense research in favor of social<br />\nresearch.<br />\nGordon pointed out that if the Lab does<br />\nnot do work for the Navy, it will not have<br />\nthe equipment to carry on any kind of research at all, social or othewise.<br />\nGordon's letter also made note. of<br /><br />\nthe Student Council's suggestions last<br />\nMay for re-evaluation of APL prioriHe outlined the exchanges that<br />\nties.<br />\nhad taken place among the Council, representatves of the APL senior staff<br />\nand Advisory staff, and himself.<br />\nA spokesman for the Committee on<br />\nAPL commented, \"Gordon's letter basically says, 'Listen you guys, a year ago<br />\nI told the Student Council that the Trustees and I wouldn't do anything about<br />\nAPL, so why should I listen to you?'<br />\nGordon suggests that we go through the<br />\nStudent Council. If that wasn't pathetic,<br /><br />\nit would be funny.\"<br />\nThe letter recalled vigorous objections made in the past by himself and<br />\nby APL representatives to the political<br />\nand moral judgment expressed in \"Use<br />\nor Abuse,\" a pamphlet published by the<br />\nCommittee for APL.<br /><br />\nWar Is Wrong<br />\nAccording to a Committee spokesman,<br />\n\"The only moral judgment in the pamphlet is against the Vietnam War.

Instead<br />\nof an open space, the doors revealed a<br />\nsteel wall. This produced the biggest<br />\nlaught of the day.<br /><br />\nKeogh quickly established the tone of<br />\nMonday's investigation when he invited<br />\npassers-by to \"Join the navy, fight inthe<br />\nternational communism and see<br />\nworld.\"<br /><br />\nLater, an employee upstairs explained<br />\nthat the outer steel door often doesn't open<br />\nwhen the elevator is over-crowded. \"Apparently you don't have to be subversive<br />\nto have this happen to you,\" Pfeffer cracked.<br />\nThere was some indication that noon had<br />\nbeen picked as the best time to begin the<br />\nInvestigation so that students could be<br />\n*settled in the ONR office when the representative returned from lunch. But Barton<br />\nHall employees thought it unlikely that he<br />\nwould come back that afternoon. The students decided to break up and to go to<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThe Committee has no plans for another<br />\ninvestigation in the future. \"I had a good<br />\ntime,' Keogh said, \"and if I really want to<br />\nfind out something, there's better ways<br />\nthan coining with twenty people.\"<br /><br />\nEmpty Office<br /><br />\nLocal campus activists went on an unsuccessful foray Monday to locate the Office of Naval<br />\nResearch on campus.<br /><br />\nAt about 12:45, p.m. a group of fifteen<br />\nwalked over to Barton Hall and crowded<br />\ninto the elevator to ride up to the fourth<br />\nfloor.

Informed sources report<br />\nthat nationally the Moratorium Committee is on the verge<br />\nof folding for lack of funds. A schematic diagram of the<br />\n\"liberal\" movement reads like the complex power structure of a corporate holding company. At the top is the<br />\nNew Mobilization. With seats on the New Mobe board,<br />\nyet in reality independent, are the Moratorium Committee<br />\nand the Student Mobilization Committee. -Everyone has<br />\nauthority but no one has power.<br />\nIn Baltimore, the Moratorium Committee planned an<br />\nall night vigil Wednesday followed by a noon rally. Then,<br />\nthe SMC stepped in, and against the advice of local organizers, planned a march from Hopkins to the rally site for 10<br />\nA.M., conflicting with the vigil.<br />\nThe rally failed, not only because of the weather and<br />\ninterfactional mismanagement, but also because people are<br />\nsimply tired of rallies. increasingly; things are polarizing<br />\nwithin the movement. People are either opting for violence or going out and working for a candidate. Peaceful<br />\nstreet protests are quickly becoming a thing of the past.<br />\nThere were no businessmen to be seen at the rally in<br />\nBaltimore, and few at those in other parts of the country.<br />\nThis, even though the theme of the moratorium--linking<br />\nhigh taxes to the war\u2014was aimed at them. As one frustrated local organizer stated, the Moratorium is \"not getting<br />\nthe older people on the streets like it used to.\"<br />\nAt Berkeley, students split into small groups for<br />\nWeatherman-style back street activities. The rally at Harvard Square drew more people--again mostly students--than<br />\n- were present on October 15. But the situation in Boston<br />\nis polarizing as well. There, where it is now fashionable<br />\nto be against the war, businessmen sport Moratorium<br />\nbuttons, Students have turned to the more radical groups,<br />\nthe SMC and the Mobe.<br />\nAll this proves one thing\u2014the movement is leaderless<br />\nonce more. FOr a while it looked as if the coalition of antiwar groups operating under the New Mobe banner out of<br />\nWashington would be able to pull things together. It did<br />\nso in October and again in November, but in April it<br />\nappears to have lost its steam.<br /><br />\nHopkins as Landlord<br />\nThe University's strict adherance to basic economic<br />\nrules for landlords has seriously impaired a group of community projects in the area surrounding the School for<br />\nAdvanced International Studies. The University, which<br />\nclaims involvement with the city that surrounds it and<br />\npoints with pride to the civic projects of its students,<br />\nturns around and tells a Washington church that it must<br />\ncome up with $6000 rent or watch its civic projects be<br />\nturned into a parking lot.<br />\nSt. Margaret's Episcopal church and a large group of<br />\nconcerned citizens, including students from American University, have invested a great deal of time and money fixing up what were but a few months ago vandal-destroyed<br />\nbuildings. Yet every six months they face the possibility<br />\nof seeing their work fall to the bulldozers unless they can<br />\nraise the $1000 per month demanded by their landlord,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nIf Hopkins is truly concerned with the plight of the<br />\ninner city, if it actually wants to better the community<br />\nwhich surrounds it, here is an excellent opportunity to<br />\nshow it. All involved with the projects claim that the rent<br />\nis too high, while one would assume that an idealistic<br />\nUniversity would charge such a worthy tenant a rent<br />\nsubstantially below the community average. In fact it<br />\nwould seem that Hopkins should jump at the opportunity<br />\nto help by simply allowing these people to use unused<br />\nbuildings. We see no reason for the University charging<br />\nrent, and ask that it be rescinded immediately.<br /><br />\n. . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />\n!. . .Pavlovics<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nBy EMIL PAVLOVICS<br />\nGot bombed (as in drunk)the other night and then<br />\ndropped by the peace vigil at Federal Plaza.Didn't<br />\nspecifically go to get laid, didn't as a matter of fact<br />\neven have it on my mind.

Few<br />\nwars have ever been ended by groups of people<br />\ncongregating out of sight(as in out of mind), warmed by the glow of their candles and the purity of<br />\ntheir intentions, singing songs of hope and togetherness.<br />\nDid the vigilants actually expect some of the<br />\npolicemen to join them, or was it the Baltimore<br />\nStreet 4 a.m. drunkards that they were attempting to influence? Ole Joe Baltimore chuckled into<br />\nhis morning coffee over the stupid peaceniks who<br />\ndidn't have the sense to come in out of the rain<br />\nand get a decent night's sleep.<br />\n***<br />\nWith all the seriousness of purpose of a lacrosse<br />\njock discussing his academic career with Dean Swanson,<br />\nthe Committee for APL set out to investigate the Office<br />\nof Naval Research in Barton Hall.<br />\nCommittee leader Jim Keogh quickly established<br />\nthe tone of the Venture when Ile invited passers-by<br />\nfrom the steps of Levering, \"Join the Navy,fight international communism and see the world. You'd expect<br />\nthe office of Naval Research to be on the water. I'd<br />\nlike to know why it's on this campus and what they do<br />\nhere.\"<br /><br />\nAnd it's tough to ignore a bombed-out building.<br />\nOr be a little more subtle. Not too subtle, but a<br />\nbit. Call for Baltimore to take the morning off for<br />\npeace, and to ensure that the average worker does<br />\nknock out a number of important traffic lights.<br />\nAll the commuters caught in the ensuing traffic jam will hear on their 20/20 news that the tie<br />\nup was caused by peacenik radicals trying to stop<br />\nthe war. They won't like it, but they'll at least<br />\nthink about it for the couple of hours that they are<br />\ncaught in traffic. And that's better than being buried in the back of the Baltimore Sun.<br />\nIt's about time that we stop being vigilant about<br />\nthe war and start becoming vigilantes about the<br />\nwar. The \"Pet Peeve of the Month to Stop the<br />\nWar\" campaign is getting a little tiresome and<br />\nmore than a little silly.<br />\nIt was nice to see all the love-me-I'm-a-liberal<br />\nsorts actually breaking the law last month in front<br />\nof the Customs House, but tell me, what good<br />\ndid it do? Aside, of course, from the warm feelings in all their sincere hearts that they \"are<br />\ndoing something for peace.\"<br />\nIn all the cowboy movies, vigilantes are the<br />\npeople who take the law \"into their own hands\"<br />\nafter the bad guys get control over the crooked<br />\nor weak sheriff. It is not the vigilantes who are<br />\nbreaking the law, the enforcers of law are the<br />\ntrue lawbreakers.<br />\nNow, I'm not trying to draw any modern day<br />\nparallels, because, after all, we all don't walk<br />\naround with six-shooters. Though I do know a<br />\nchick who is planning on getting a knife. And I'm<br />\ngetting really tired hearing about pens being<br />\nmightier than swords, or ballots better than bullets. And there are seven people in jail in Chicago<br />\nwho have been lynched by a pretty shady looking<br />\n\"hanging judge.\" And the wick on a Molotov Cocktail is as bright as any candle....<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nThe way to wake up Baltimore isnot to hit them<br />\nwhen they are asleep and then disappear before<br />\nthey wake up. Bomb their offices while they are<br />\nasleep, and they might notice it when they wake<br />\nup. If they can't ignore something,then they won't.<br />\n(A self serving statement, if there ever was one.)<br /><br />\n***<br />\nThere was some indication that noon had been<br />\npicked as the best time to begin the \"field trip\"so that<br />\nthe students could greet the ONR representative when<br />\nhe returned from lunch. But Barton Hall employees<br />\nthought it unlikely that he would come back that afternoon. The students decided to break up and go to<br />\nclasses.<br /><br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nGOOD-BYE RENT STRIKE<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nLest I be thought a traitor to my own cause, I<br />\nwish to clarify two points connectedwith my abdication as a leader of the rent strike movement in<br />\ngraduate student housing.<br />\nFirst, the issue of female undergraduate residence in McCoy has largely dissipated. It will<br />\nbe recalled that the evident intention of the administration to lodge large numbers of female undergraduates in McCoy for an indefinite period was the<br />\noriginal cause of rent strike agitation. This was<br />\nnot a selfish issue, since the plan was also opposed by undergraduates and seemed to be contrary to the interests of the women themselves.<br />\nIn any case, if the current recommendation of<br />\nDean Swanson is implemented, the residence of<br />\nundergraduate females in McCoy will last for<br />\nonly one year, until girls are admitted into the<br />\nfreshman class, and the conversion of dormitory spaces becomes feasible. The number of<br />\nfemale undergraduate transfers living in McCoy<br />\nnext year is now expected to be small: 25-35.<br />\nIf the number seeking housing turns out to be<br />\nmuch larger, an effort will supossedly be made<br />\nto find dormitory space for women for the coming year.<br />\nOn this issue, there now seems little to do but<br />\nwait and test the administration's intentions.<br />\nAction may be necessary at some future date,<br />\nbut I suspect that the female undergraduates<br />\nwill themselves reject permanent residence in<br />\nMcCoy, once they have established themselves<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nSecond, the objections to the 5% rent increase<br />\nand the abolition of switchboard service have<br /><br />\nalways been somewhat tenuous. In view of the<br />\ngeneral inflation and the recent wage increases<br />\nat Hopkins, the argument that the costs of graduate housing have increased must be accepted,<br />\nuntil someone launches a study of administration<br />\nefficiency. To argue that the university should<br />\ndivert funds from other activities to subsidize<br />\ngraduate housing is obviously divisive and not<br />\nconstructive. In some departments, graduate<br />\nfellowhip stipends have been increased to meet<br />\ninflationary pressures, and this would seem the<br />\nmore appropriate remedy for graduate students<br />\nto seek. Such increases may mean fewer new<br />\ngraduate students, but in view of the current<br />\njob market, a reduction may be necessary anyway.<br />\nAs for switchboard service, a study conducted<br />\nby students last year revealed widespread dissatisfaction with the service, and it is clear that<br />\nmany students would rather take their chances<br />\nwith party lines, pay phones and private homes.<br />\nIf the university could work out an insurance<br />\nprogram with the phone company to avoid the<br />\nnecessity of deposits, this complaint would soon<br />\nfade away.<br />\nFor these reasons, I am no longer prepared<br />\nto sacrifice the great amount of time which<br />\nwould be required to organize and co-ordinate<br />\na rent strike. If someone else should wish to<br />\nmake this sacrifice, I will gladly make available to him all information that I have on the<br />\nissue.<br />\nRaymond W.

We have all had a<br />\ntaste of the epistemological contortions of higher academe and<br />\nmy soul and/or intellect is not<br />\nuplifted by hearing these tales<br />\nof emotional woe and intellectual strivings recouched in even<br />\nmore maudlin terms.<br />\nIn high school, I remember<br />\na budding poet barf up the following (which made a big hit<br />\namong the people who have now<br />\nprobably evolved to The Review<br />\nstage):<br /><br />\nI stood by my pond<br />\nAnd wondered what Life meant.<br />\nI threw a stone,<br />\nAnd watched the ripples spread.<br />\nThe question is answered.<br />\nNo joke. And that, for the most<br />\npart, captures the spirit of The<br />\nCharles Street Review. The same<br />\nschoolgirl poems about love (or<br />\nany other subject) except with<br /><br />\nbigger<br />\nwords (and SYMBOLISM !!! !).<br />\nTake, for instance, the short<br />\nstory by Josh Geberer on page<br />\n12, \"One More Time.\" Summarized, we have the pained tale<br />\nof the narrator (a true picaresque figure) telling of Ellen<br />\nivho kissed him on the lips, and<br />\nleft him to sit in his bleak room<br />\nlistening to the radiator hum<br />\n(he can nearly even hear the<br />\nelectricity, mind you), watching the lights(which flit-flit along<br />\nthe spectrum from white to blue<br />\nto OPALINE! !! !) and then writing it all down to show Ellen in<br />\nthe morning.<br />\nOf course, our suffer's epic<br />\nagony is yet to come. While<br />\nhis room-mate is balling Ellen<br />\nin the next room, he recalls an<br />\nearlier romantic encounter. Naturally, their early love flowered<br />\nout in the elements, Mother Nature (flowers, love, peace, beauty).<br /><br />\nOpaline<br /><br />\n\u20141<br /><br />\n(of the high price record habit)<br /><br />\nEpiphanic moments are crucial to th genre:<br />\n\"We were in bed all weekend...<br />\nWe almost did it in the morning, but Mrs. Cinle knocked on<br />\nthe door...I was embarrassed and<br />\nangry, and then I didn't want to<br />\ndo it.

Hirsh, a junior, is in<br />\nfirst starting year for the<br />\navaliers. Hirsh should<br />\ndo an<br />\ntici cluate job. He has been steadimproving all season. Last<br />\nYar, playing behind first<br />\nteam<br /><br />\nall-Amercan Jim Eustace, Hirsh<br />\ndid not get much experience in<br />\ngame situations. He played only<br />\na few minutes against Hopkins<br />\nlast year after the Blue Jays had<br />\nsewed up a 15-4 victory.<br />\nThe rest of U. Va.'s close defense is comparable to Hopkins'<br />\nSenior Doug Hilbert, a converted midfielder, is joined by two<br />\nfreshmen, Bruce Mangels and<br />\nTom Dawes. All three are from<br />\nBaltimore. One drawback the<br />\nVirginia defenseman will have to<br />\nsurmount is penalties. A penalty<br />\nprone defense could hurt but Hopkins has not scored well in oneman up situations so far this year.<br />\nVirginia usually runs three<br />\nmidfields, with Jim Potter and<br />\nDick Proutt handling most of the<br />\nfaceoff chores for the Cavaliers.<br />\nSo far this season Proutt and<br />\nPotter have controlled about two<br />\nof their faceoffs. Virginia's first midfield is anchored<br />\nby Potter, who was a second<br />\nteam all-American last season,<br />\nand Charlie Rullman. Rullman<br />\nwas a third team all-American<br />\nselection on attack last season.<br />\nEleven goals and five assists<br />\nhave been scored between these<br />\ntwo senior co-captains.<br />\nThe<br />\nhigh scoring midfielder for Virginia is sophomore Pete Eldridge<br />\nwith 7 goals and 2 assists. The<br />\nmidfields give Virginia a balanced scoring punch in coordination with their attack.<br />\nThe team's leading goal getters are on the attack. On the<br />\ncrease is junior, Rick Beach,<br />\nwho has 12 goals in his first<br />\nseason of college lacrosse. Against the Alumni last Sunday,<br />\nBeach had three goals.<br />\nAnother big threat on the offense for U. Va. is freshman<br />\nTom Duquette. Last season Duquette was an all-MSA performer for Gilman School. In four<br /><br />\ngames, the freshman standout<br />\nhas nine goals and ten assists,<br />\nwhich shows his versatility as<br />\nboth a scorer and feeder. Last<br />\nSunday, he led the Cavalier scorers with four goals.<br />\nThe third Cavalier attackman<br />\nis sophomore Jay Connor. Connor missed the opened against<br />\nMount Washington, but in the<br />\nthree games since, he has scored<br />\n5 goals and has been credited<br />\nwith 5 assists. Alongwith Beach,<br />\nhe had 3 goals against U Va.'s<br />\nalumni.<br />\nOne has to give the edge to<br />\nthe Blue Jays who command a 5-0<br />\nrecord and a six game win streak.<br />\nVirginia has not beaten a Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team since 1963, and<br />\nthe last time they won at.Charlottesville was in 1953. The Jays<br />\nhold a 24-3-1 edge in the series,<br />\nwhich dates back to 1904.<br />\nRecord books are deceiving,<br /><br />\nand Virginia, with more depth,<br />\nexperience, and talent than last<br />\nyear, should make the contest<br />\nclose. Virginia should be competitive in the Mid-Eastern Division this year. Last year, the<br />\nCavaliers came to Homewood<br />\nconfident and cocky. Their 15-4<br />\nloss to hopkins last year, plus<br />\nlast week's preview should stymie any such feelings this year.<br />\nObservers who have seen both<br />\nclub in action this season favor<br />\nHopkins. 12-10. However, this<br />\nweekend is Virginia's Easters<br />\nweekend, which could have a<br />\npositive or negative affect on<br />\nthe Cavaliers' performance.<br />\nThe News-Letter guest with<br />\nthe Blue Jays 14-10, based on<br />\nKen Dauses superiority to Hirsh<br />\nand an equally strong midfield<br />\ncontingent led by Chaffe Coker,<br />\nDoug Ilonig, and Gary Handleman. Virgnina has been noted<br /><br />\nthis season for their control of<br />\ngroundballs, but the Blue Jay's<br />\nmidfields should nullify this advantage.<br />\nShunning making a prediction,<br />\nCoach Bob Scott cites, \"This is<br />\nboth team opener in the MidEastern Division, which encompasses the national college powers.

The<br />\nmarchers, about one hundred strong,<br />\nwere almost all Baltimore high school<br />\nstudents, many of whom said they risked<br />\ndisciplinary<br />\nmeasures for skipping<br />\nclasses. The march was the Mobe's first<br />\nforay into Baltimore anti-war activites.<br />\nA platform and sound system were<br />\nthen set up in the shelter of the walkway<br />\nin preparation for the noon rally. Lance<br />\nYateman, a Moratorium organizer, told<br />\nthe demonstrators that although it was<br />\nstill raining, \"spiritually the sun's out.\"<br />\n\"Nixon had better listen to us,\" said<br />\nYateman. \"The next time a Nixon or a<br />\nJohnson decides to hold a war in Asia,<br />\nain't nobody comin'.\"<br /><br />\nThe rally began with a speech by Charlotte Mitten, Chairman of the Baltimore<br />\nWelfare Rights Organization. In keeping<br />\nwith the Moratorium's April theme, she<br />\nexhorted the government to \"bring the<br />\nmoney home.\" Arguing that the Federal<br />\nGovernment didn't care about ghetto children until they reached draft age, Mrs.<br />\nMitten urged the establishment of a guaranteed annual income to enable poor children to receive decent education and<br />\nhousing.<br /><br />\nLeaflet VFW<br />\nRobert B.Johnson of the Maryland Veterans for Peace claimed that \"the enemy<br />\nIs ignorance\" and that the ugly truth about<br />\nthe Vietnam war must be brought home to<br />\nthe \"Silent Majority.\" \"If you want to<br />\npass out a leaflet, go to the Veterans of<br />\nForeign Wars,go to the American Legion,<br />\ngo to middle America,\" urged Johnson.<br />\nParen Mitchell,the Associate Director<br />\nof the Urban Studies Institute at Morgan<br />\nState College, called for an attack upon<br />\nthe institutions that are responsible for<br />\nVietnam and for the ghettos -- militarism<br />\nand racism. Commented Mitchell, \"As<br />\nwe unleash the capacity to kill in Vietnam,<br />\nwe maximize the possibility of violence<br />\nhere at home.\"<br /><br />\nTheme of Day's Actions<br /><br />\nRepression in the US was attacked by<br />\nWalter Carter.

He is considered politically left of Mandel. The<br />\nprimary is in September.<br /><br />\nOne of the staunchest opponents to the<br />\nliberalized abortion law is Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle, Archbishop of Washington.<br />\nShriver is in O'Boyle's archdiocese.<br /><br />\n\\sr<br /><br />\n. Equal to Alcohol<br /><br />\n-Get Out\"<br />\nHe told the audience that he was infavor<br />\n\"of getting out of Vietnam on a timetable right away and completely,\" although he refused to support the Moratorium movement.<br />\n\"No, I won't be attending the Moratorium. I had planned tomorrow to be<br />\nin Washington to see a few people,\" he<br />\nremarked. Instead, he visited Montgomery County and the Hopkins Drug Abuse<br />\nCenter Wednesday.<br />\nConcerning the emotion-laden abortion<br />\nlaw now before the Governor, Shriver<br />\nstated that if he were Mandel he would<br />\nsign the bill and recommend it be presented in a referendum to the electorate.<br /><br />\nSargent Shriver: \"I have an open<br />\nmind on the legalization of marijuana.He added though, \"I wouldn't have this<br />\nbill on my desk because I wouldhave<br />\nspent quite a bit of time trying to get a<br />\nmuch more comprehensive bill enacted<br />\ninto law.\"<br /><br />\nThe former Ambassador to France and<br />\nhis wife are Catholic.

I would rather he kill him than<br />\nsell him that stuff,\" Shriver declared.<br />\nHis position on the Calvert Cliffs dispute centered on ending the construction<br />\nof the nuclear power plant until its effect<br />\non the Chesapeake Bay is studied.<br />\nHowever, Shriver expressed sympathy<br />\nfor the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. \"I am told that to stop the construction of the installation at this time<br />\nmight bring serious, if not irreparable<br />\ndamage to the company.\" If this is the<br />\ncase, Shriver implied that a financial<br />\nreimbursement would be in order.<br />\nProceeding into the area of the Negro<br />\nand the poor, Shriver said, \"I think that<br />\nthe first thing that all people deserve is<br />\nequality of treatment and equality before<br />\nthe law.\"<br />\n\"We've got to make an extra effort to<br />\ncorrect the imbalances of the past,\"<br />\nhe added.<br /><br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nSomeone's Thing to Share<br /><br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br /><br />\nTHE SEED OF DISCOVERY WAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\nCOFFEE HOUSE<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n236 E. 25 St.<br />\n243-9234<br /><br />\n467-2123<br /><br />\nBooks - Ilsed (V.

What are<br />\nthe functional relations between<br />\nmother and fetus?<br />\nThese and other questions are<br />\nbeing intensively studied on a<br />\nremote corner of the Homewood<br />\ncampus by a group which, on<br />\npaper at least, has nothing to<br />\ndo with Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nresearchers are all staff members of the Carnegie Institution<br />\nof Washington, and their building is the modern glass-andconcrete one northwest of the<br />\nROTC building.<br />\nThe Carnegie Institute is a<br />\nfar-flung, privately endowed research organization, with six<br />\nessentially autonomous departments stretching from New York<br />\nto California. The one in Baltimore is the Department of Embryology.<br />\n\"We are conceuned primarily<br />\nwith basic research,\" explained<br />\nDr. James Ebert, director of<br />\nthe department, \"but we have<br />\nalways had a mixture of M.D.'s<br />\nand Ph.D.'s, and practicality is<br />\none of our watchwords.\"<br />\nHe<br />\nnoted that much of the original<br />\nwork which went into the development of both the birth control pill and the intra-uterine<br />\ndevice (IUD) was done at the lab.<br />\nEbert listed the three fields<br />\nwhich the researchers are'presently investigating as human<br /><br />\nembryology, experimental embryology and the physiology of<br />\nreproduction. In the past the<br />\nlab also did work on organ transplantation, but the research has<br />\ntemporarily been stopped. \"If<br />\nwe get any new ideas, we may<br />\npick up on that again,\" Ebert<br />\ncommented.<br />\nThe Institution was founded by<br />\nAndrew Carnegie in 1902. The<br />\nEmbryology Department was established in 1913 by Dr. Franklin Mall, a professor of Anatomy<br />\nat Hopkins.. It originally inhabited a building on the corner<br />\nof Wolfe and Madison Streets,<br />\nand moved to its present location in 1962. The Institution<br />\nnegotiated a 99-year lease with<br />\nthe University, after which time<br />\nthe building reverts to Hopkins.<br />\nEmbryology, one of the smallest of the departments, has a<br />\ncore staff of only eight permanent members. Besides these,<br />\nthere are 16 other spaces for<br />\nsenior<br />\nvisiting investigators,<br />\ngraduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br />\nIn addition to researchers, the<br />\nlab contains the world's largest<br />\ncollection of human embryos-10,000--as well as rabbits, rats,<br />\nmice, hamsters, guinea pigs,<br />\nfrogs, toads, chickens, worms<br />\nand silkworms.
