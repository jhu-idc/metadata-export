That disad-<br />\n<br />\nvantage lies in giving up one of the thin6a in which<br />\nHopkinsmen have felt a legitimate pride: the sensible<br />\nbelief that freshmen should be taken readily into all the<br />\nconcerns of the campus, and that this was best achieved<br />\nby making no artificial distinction between them and<br />\nupperclassmen.<br />\nThe caps are a small distinction, to be sure, but<br />\nthey are a beginning.

First of all, it seems that<br />\nthe<br />\nfuror concerning the subject is hared}, justified;<br />\nit is<br />\nhardly to be suspected that the wearing of<br />\nfreshman<br />\ncaps will have the earth-shaking effects on<br />\ndemocracy<br />\nand morala that some of the opponents seem<br />\nto fear.<br />\nSecondly, it should be realized that a certain<br />\namount of<br />\nfrivolity and of the \"Hopkins dignity\" should<br />\nbe compatible: and the \"well-rounded Hopkins gentleman\"<br />\nbecomes a little warped with too great an emphasis<br />\non the<br />\nlatter.<br />\nThe point I would like to make is that if<br />\nthe Council<br />\nis going to undertake to establish<br />\nfreshman rules, it<br />\nmust also set up rules for controlling the<br />\nupperclassmen<br />\nin this matter. Hazing is not intended, but<br />\nit does not<br />\nfollow that hazing will not happen.

One of<br />\nMiss Bankhead's first lines is an<br />\naside to the audience, where she<br />\nsays that she does not understand<br />\nthe play. At one time she has an<br />\naside in which she says, after one<br />\nof her lines, \"That's the worst line<br />\nI've ever had to say on the stage.\"<br />\nThe third act opens with an announcement that seven of the actors<br />\nhave become suddenly ill, and that<br />\nsome substitutes had been found,<br />\nbut they would have to have a short<br />\nrehearsal.<br />\nIt may be reasonably asked how<br />\nthe author, in adopting such un-orthodox tactics in the creation of an intensely interesting play, can ever<br />\nreturn to any impression of reality-and it must be admitted that an audience must be able to accept a play,<br />\nfor the moment at least, if the play<br />\nis to be successful. The answer, I<br />\nbelieve, lies in the fact that Mr Wilder seems to use his intimacy with<br />\nthe audience for relief from the<br />\npoints of tension in the play. The<br />\nmost tense situation needs some relief, in any play, in order for the<br />\ntension not to be completely overpowering. Mr Wilder achieves this<br />\nrelief by the above-mentioned methods. After a lapse into such freedom, he begins immediately to build<br />\nup for his next scene. The admission that the whole thing is a play<br />\nhas, therefore, an organic purpose<br />\nand hence does not interfere serimteati-srefs're eframatle<br />\nmoments of the play.<br />\nIn the third act there is a very<br />\ntense scene between the father and<br />\nthe son: when the scene is over the<br />\nmother says, \"Let's skip to the end<br />\nof the scene.\" And they do.

The objectors say that the<br />\nwearing of caps, Hell Day, and similar such institutions will inevitably<br />\nlead to rowdyism and the degeneration of the Hopkins into a typical<br />\n\"Joe College\" university.<br />\nIf these violent objectors had attended Freshman day last Saturday,<br />\nI am inclined to think that they<br />\nwould change their views. The freshmen who were there Saturday regarded the wearing of the caps not<br />\nas something debasing or something<br />\nthat they were forced to do, but<br />\nrather as a privilege.

First of all, it seems that<br />\nthe<br />\nfuror concerning the subject is hared}, justified;<br />\nit is<br />\nhardly to be suspected that the wearing of<br />\nfreshman<br />\ncaps will have the earth-shaking effects on<br />\ndemocracy<br />\nand morala that some of the opponents seem<br />\nto fear.<br />\nSecondly, it should be realized that a certain<br />\namount of<br />\nfrivolity and of the \"Hopkins dignity\" should<br />\nbe compatible: and the \"well-rounded Hopkins gentleman\"<br />\nbecomes a little warped with too great an emphasis<br />\non the<br />\nlatter.<br />\nThe point I would like to make is that if<br />\nthe Council<br />\nis going to undertake to establish<br />\nfreshman rules, it<br />\nmust also set up rules for controlling the<br />\nupperclassmen<br />\nin this matter. Hazing is not intended, but<br />\nit does not<br />\nfollow that hazing will not happen.

One of<br />\nMiss Bankhead's first lines is an<br />\naside to the audience, where she<br />\nsays that she does not understand<br />\nthe play. At one time she has an<br />\naside in which she says, after one<br />\nof her lines, \"That's the worst line<br />\nI've ever had to say on the stage.\"<br />\nThe third act opens with an announcement that seven of the actors<br />\nhave become suddenly ill, and that<br />\nsome substitutes had been found,<br />\nbut they would have to have a short<br />\nrehearsal.<br />\nIt may be reasonably asked how<br />\nthe author, in adopting such un-orthodox tactics in the creation of an intensely interesting play, can ever<br />\nreturn to any impression of reality-and it must be admitted that an audience must be able to accept a play,<br />\nfor the moment at least, if the play<br />\nis to be successful. The answer, I<br />\nbelieve, lies in the fact that Mr Wilder seems to use his intimacy with<br />\nthe audience for relief from the<br />\npoints of tension in the play. The<br />\nmost tense situation needs some relief, in any play, in order for the<br />\ntension not to be completely overpowering. Mr Wilder achieves this<br />\nrelief by the above-mentioned methods. After a lapse into such freedom, he begins immediately to build<br />\nup for his next scene. The admission that the whole thing is a play<br />\nhas, therefore, an organic purpose<br />\nand hence does not interfere serimteati-srefs're eframatle<br />\nmoments of the play.<br />\nIn the third act there is a very<br />\ntense scene between the father and<br />\nthe son: when the scene is over the<br />\nmother says, \"Let's skip to the end<br />\nof the scene.\" And they do.

In an attempt to<br />\nfurther this principle of freedom,<br />\nhazing and freshman rules were<br />\nabolished in 1924.<br />\nSince that time a tradition has<br />\nbeen built'up which affirms the spirit<br />\nof student liberty and self-determination. This is, in our conception,<br />\nthe 'school spirit' of Hopkins.<br />\nSteps have recently been taken to<br />\nimpose upon this spirit regulations<br />\nfound necessary in schools which<br />\nhave different purposes and seek different ends, purposes and ends which<br />\nwe believe incompatible with those<br />\nsought at the Hopkins. We feel<br />\nthat a restriction of freedom, except<br />\nwhere such a restriction is absolutely<br />\nnecessary for the welfare of the<br />\nmajority of students, would destroy<br />\na tradition which has been cherished<br />\nhere for years.<br />\nWe doubt that petty regulations<br />\nwill ever result in a genuine school<br />\nspirit which goes deeper than the<br />\nsurface. The only really admirable<br />\nschool feeling is the one which arises<br />\nspontaneously from within, such as<br />\nthe feeling of self-determination and<br />\nfreedom which we feel many Hop'kinsmen have experienced.<br />\nWe feel that the spirit of the Hopkins is such that the freshman should<br />\nbe assimilated as soon as possible.<br />\nA distinction between the freshman<br />\nand the upperclassman should not<br />\nexist after the first few days.<br />\nFurther, we feel that the wearing<br />\nof freshman caps on any but an entirely voluntary basis would mean<br />\nthe rejection of an ideal which has<br />\nlong persisted in our university.<br />\nThis some up our attitude toward<br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col 1)<br /><br />\nTo the editor, The NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nBellowing, as of a gored ox, seems<br />\nto have broken out on all sides over<br />\nthe Student Council's decision to<br />\nrequire all October freshmen to wear<br />\ncaps on campus.<br />\nThe objectors to this freshman rule<br />\nmaintain that the freshmen will not<br />\nwant to wear the caps, but will be<br />\nafraid to raise their, voices in protest. The objectors say that the<br />\nwearing of caps, Hell Day, and similar such institutions will inevitably<br />\nlead to rowdyism and the degeneration of the Hopkins into a typical<br />\n\"Joe College\" university.<br />\nIf these violent objectors had attended Freshman day last Saturday,<br />\nI am inclined to think that they<br />\nwould change their views. The freshmen who were there Saturday regarded the wearing of the caps not<br />\nas something debasing or something<br />\nthat they were forced to do, but<br />\nrather as a privilege. That bunch<br />\nof freshmen were enthusiastic about<br />\nestablishing a real class spirit among<br />\nthemselves, and a real Hopkins spirit<br />\namong all the undergraduates.<br />\nAs to the second objection, that<br />\nrowdyism will be 'brought back to<br />\nthe campus, I think that there exists<br />\nan effective method of keeping the<br />\n\"spirit\" under control.
