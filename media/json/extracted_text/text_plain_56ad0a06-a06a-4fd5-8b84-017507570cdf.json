The Committee<br />\nconsists of five faculty members<br />\nand four students.<br />\nThe proposal to begin<br />\nplus/minus grading was first<br />\nforwarded last year and passed<br />\nunanimously by the CUS. Subsequently, students were given<br />\nthe opportunity to express their<br />\nfeelings on plus/minus grading in<br />\na referendum. Students voted<br />\nagainst the plan 60-40. The CUS<br />\nthen moved to reconsider the<br />\noriginal motion on plus/minus<br />\ngrading.<br />\nThe plan currently under<br />\nconsideration was set forth by<br />\nJames Walker of the Physics<br />\ndepartment. In discussion before<br />\nthe CUS, Walker said he supported the plan because he<br />\nfelt that it would reduce competition. lie said that lie has had<br />\nnumerous requests to regrade<br />\nsince one point can make the<br />\ndifference between a grade that<br />\nis almost an A or nearly a C with<br />\nno means of differentiating<br />\nmore closely. He stated that<br />\nthere was legitimate uncertainty<br />\namong faculty members in assigning borderline grades when<br />\nsuch large gradations are at<br />\nstake.<br />\nWalker also noted that the<br />\nlack of plus/minus grading has<br />\nbeen detrimental to Hopkins<br />\nstudents applying to graduate or<br />\nprofessional schools. A number<br />\nof the better schools have always<br />\nhad plus/minus grading, and<br />\nothers have now moved back to<br />\nthat system. He expressed the<br />\nfeeling that if grades are to be<br />\n<br />\ngiven at all they should be as<br />\nmeaningful as possible.<br />\nDean Hooker indicated that<br />\nhe agrees with Walker's reasoning, but felt that the students<br />\nwere approaching the proposal<br />\nas an emotional issue, preferring<br />\nthe \"familiar evil\" of whole<br />\ngrades to the uncertainty of<br />\nplus/minus grading.<br />\nIn further discussion, Professor Hall of the Psychology<br />\ndepartment pointed out that the<br />\nfaculty has had no hidden<br />\ninterest in the plus/minus system, that they were motivated<br />\nby the feeling that it is in the<br />\nbest interests of the students.<br />\nShe noted that the system was<br />\nnot less troublesome for the<br />\nfaculty, but they simply feel it is<br />\nnot fair.<br />\nA motion by Robert Elkin<br />\nand George Connolly to rescind<br />\nlast year's committee motion in<br />\nfavor of the plus/minus system<br />\nfailed, seven to two.<br />\nMathematical Sciences Professor Karr moved that the<br />\nfollowing system of grading be<br />\nadopted for all students in<br />\nSeptember of 1980, or as soon as<br />\nit is feasable: A=4.0, A-=3.7,<br />\nB+=3.3, B=3.0, 13-=2.7, C+=2.3,<br />\nC=2.0, C-=1.7, D=1.0, F=0. D+,<br />\nD- and A+ are not being considered so that the 4.0 scale<br />\ncan be retained. The motion was<br />\npassed, seven in favor, none<br />\nopposed and two abstaining.<br />\nThe motion will now go to<br />\nthe Academic Council, made up<br />\nof 12 faculty members with all<br />\nthe full deans as ex-officio<br />\nmembers and Steven Muller<br />\nchairman.The<br />\nex-officio<br />\nas<br />\nCouncil has the final authority<br />\non the issue.<br />\nThe Student Council has<br />\nalready expressed its opposition<br />\nto the grading change.

The<br />\ndepartment is presently located<br />\nin Latrobe Hall, where space and<br />\nfacilities have become inade-quate. Particularly lacking are<br />\nclassrooms<br />\nand<br />\nteaching<br />\nlabs..Space is now used in Ames<br />\nand Macauley halls to fulfill the<br />\ndepartment's needs.<br />\nEstimated construction cost<br />\nfor the new building is<br />\n$5,164,302. An anonymous<br />\ndonor will pay $4,782,102. and<br />\n<br />\nReports Say Muller In Running<br />\nFor Berkeley's Chancellorship<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br />\nA University of California at<br />\nBerkeley selections committee<br />\nhas narrowed its choices for<br />\nchancellorship to four men,<br />\nincluding Johns Hopkins University president Steven Muller. The<br />\nchancellorship is roughly equivalent to the president's job at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, encompassing<br />\ncontrol of all Berkeley institutions.<br />\nThe rumor has met with<br />\nunanimous denial by administration sources on the Homewood<br />\ncampus, who contend that Muller is not interested in the<br />\npost.<br />\nMuller, in Europe until<br />\n<br />\nJanuary 29, is unavailable for<br />\ncomment.<br />\nMuller's name is one of<br />\n\"hundreds\" initially examined<br />\nfor the job according to a report<br />\npublished in the January 15<br />\nedition of the Daily Californian,<br />\nBerkeley's student newspaper.<br />\nThe first group of ii persons<br />\nchosen did not include Muller.<br />\nHis name was added to a second,<br />\nmore select group.<br />\nThe other candidates are<br />\nBerkeley vice-chancellor Ira M.<br />\nHeyman, Berkeley's business<br />\nschool dean Earl Cheit, and<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania provost Barton Gregorian.<br />\nThe Berkeley selections<br />\ncont. on p.5<br />\n<br />\nthe University is to pay the<br />\nremaining $382,000. After completion, estimated operating expenses will be $140,000 a year.<br />\nThis sum will be added to Plant<br />\nOperations' budget.<br />\nThe building itself will be<br />\napproximately 47,000 square<br />\nfeet. Though not using the<br />\nGeorgian design prevalent on<br />\ncampus, the building will be<br />\nconstructed of red brick and<br />\ncement. According to Mark<br />\nBeck, president of Mark Beck<br />\nand Associates, the firm that<br />\nplanned the building, it has been<br />\ndesigned to be as energy effici\u2014<br />\nent as possible. The three-story<br />\nstructure will be built into<br />\nthe side of a hill so that from the<br />\neast only the top floor will be<br />\nvisible while the first three floors<br />\nwill be visible from the north<br />\nand west.<br />\nWhen E & PS moves out of<br />\nLatrobe Hall, that building will<br />\nbe renovated to house the<br />\nSchool of Engineering. There are.<br />\npresently 14 faculty members,<br />\n55 graduate students and 25<br />\ndepartmental majors (under.<br />\ngrads)in E & PS. The avei age<br />\nclass now consists of 6-12 students. George Fisher, chairman<br />\nof the department, would like to<br />\nsee the number of undergrads<br />\ndouble. Both faculty and students in the department feel that<br />\nthis doubling would not be a<br />\nburden. There are no plans to<br />\nincrease overall enrollment to<br />\naccomplish this; Fisher hopes<br />\nthat these students will come<br />\nfrom among the \"undecideds\"<br />\nand premeds.<br />\nIn addition to the increase<br />\nin undergraduate enrollment, Dr.<br />\nFisher hopes that with new lab<br />\nfacilities, his department can<br />\nattract more junior faculty. Dr.<br />\nOwen Phillips, also of E & PS,<br />\nbelieves that new lab facilities<br />\nmay attract young faculty, but<br />\nsees JHU junior faculty salaries<br />\nas the key reason they are so<br />\ndifficult to obtain. Phillips explained that a young Ph.D. in<br />\nGeolow can easily find a job<br />\npaying double what 1HU offers<br />\n<br />\nin research for corporations. In<br />\naddition to salaries, job security<br />\nand advancement are are also<br />\nbetter in business research than<br />\nat JHU.<br />\nThe building plans were first<br />\nshown to the public at a meeting<br />\nof community group representatives on November 19, 1979.<br />\nHopkins had received a verbal<br />\nO.K. from the anonymous donor<br />\nto draw up plans in October. On<br />\nDecember 9, a group from JHU,<br />\nincluding Dea Kline, head of<br />\nCommunity Affairs, and William<br />\nCampbell, in charge of Physical<br />\nSpace Planning and Plant<br />\nOperations, addressed an open<br />\nmeeting of the Wyman Park<br />\nAssociation. Those present generally agreed that though this<br />\nparticular structure was designed<br />\nwith concern for the environment, they were opposed to any<br />\nbuildings in Wyman Park, which<br />\nincludes West Campus by their<br />\ndefinition.<br />\nAt a meeting of the Greater<br />\nHomewood Community Corporation (GHCC)on Januay 16, the<br />\nHopkins delegation presented<br />\nthe plans again. James Carbine.<br />\npreseident of the Wyman Park<br />\nAssociation, declared his opposition to the planned construction, saying, \"We hold this park<br />\nin trust for the future.\".

Sid Goodfriend, S.C.<br />\nsecretary, motioned that the<br />\nCouncil should issue a statement<br />\ndeclaring their opposition to<br />\nplus/minus grading, since he<br />\nfeels that the Academic Council<br />\nis not concerned enough about<br />\nthe issue. Goodfriend presented<br />\nan \"endorsement in principle\"<br />\nthat will be issued, subject to<br />\nrevisions.<br />\nThe Council discussed the<br />\npros and cons of the new grading<br />\nsystem, and two members who<br />\nhad changed their opinions to<br />\nsupport it presented their arguments. The majority, however,<br />\nstill opposes plus/minus grading.<br />\nThe final draft of Goodfriend's<br />\nstatement outlining the Council's position on the new grading<br />\nprocedure was scheduled to be<br />\npresented to Dean Hooker by<br />\nthe end of this week.<br />\nJeff Aronson, co-chairperson of the Spring Fair, stated<br />\nthat in the light of the current<br />\npolitical situation, and because<br />\nof problems getting the games<br />\narranged, the theme of the<br />\nSpring Fair will be changed from<br />\nthat of the Olympic Games to a<br />\n<br />\nMusical Celebration. The Council also revealed that it has<br />\ncompleted the Judicial Code<br />\n(formerly the Conduct Code)<br />\nand plans to issue it for student<br />\nreferendum by April 1st.<br />\nOn the issue of mandatory<br />\nretirement at age 65, the Council<br />\ndiscussed the reinstatement of<br />\nDr. Stanton, Dr. Stein and<br />\nperhaps a member of the Sciences faculty. Dr. Stanton will<br />\nteach all her regular classes after<br />\na 70-signature petition and several letters were written in<br />\nprotest of her forced retirement.<br />\nDr. Stein of the English department will also be able to teach<br />\nbecause of several reasons, including student intervention.<br />\nThe Council considered<br />\nplans to construct a new building on the University's Wyman<br />\nPark property as an issue that<br />\nwill have ramifications in<br />\n<br />\nPlus/Minus<br />\nGrading<br />\nConsidered1<br />\n<br />\nmonths to come. The proposed<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences<br />\nbuilding is controversial because<br />\nthe Wyman Park Commmunity<br />\nAssociation opposes the extension and will take legal action on<br />\nthe grounds of deed stipulations.<br />\nThe Greater Homewood Community Corporation (GHCC) favored the construction of the<br />\nbuilding by a 10-3 margin,<br />\nwith a Hopkins representative<br />\nvoting with the majority. Council members challenged the<br />\nHopkins vote and pointed out<br />\nthat the administration did not<br />\nsolicit input from students or<br />\nthe community prior to adopting plans for the building.<br />\nIn other business, George<br />\nConnolly, president of the S.C.,<br />\nexpressed his concern over attendance at the meetings. Rather<br />\nthan personally asking members<br />\nwho attend infrequently to<br />\n<br />\nresign, Connolly stated that he<br />\nwill bring up the matter before<br />\nthe Council in the future.<br />\nTreasurer Karl Block made. a<br />\npresentation on the Council's<br />\nfinancial status. It was pointed<br />\nout that the Council is financially better off than it has been in<br />\nthe past three years. As a result,<br />\nit has been able to sponsor<br />\nvarious groups and activities.<br />\nThe Women's Center and the<br />\nChamber Music Society are<br />\namong the new groups to be<br />\nfunded. For the first time in<br />\nHopkins's history, a Cheerleading Association has been started.<br />\nThe Council is also considering<br />\nthe status of a Ba'hai Club and a<br />\nnew literary magazine called<br />\nAmpersand. The status of two<br />\nnon-partisan groups, Amnesty<br />\nInternational and the New Political Caucus, is also under<br />\nconsideration at this time, but it<br />\n<br />\nmay involve legal problems.<br />\nBlock emphasized that the<br />\nCouncil encourages participation<br />\nand will not turn any group<br />\naway without considering it.<br />\nBlock's statement included a<br />\nproposal to enact a \"major<br />\noverhaul of SAC Constitutions.\"<br />\nThe meeting ended after a<br />\nvote was taken on Goodfriend's<br />\nrequest that the meeting be<br />\nclosed to outsiders. The Council<br />\ndid not get the unanimous<br />\nvote needed and, therefore,<br />\nGoodfriend withdrew his statement. Evidently, Goodfriend<br />\nwanted to make a statement<br />\nabout his alleged resignation and<br />\nhis subsequent decision to stay<br />\nwith the Council. Goodfriend<br />\nhimself avoided the question and<br />\nclaimed that he wanted to<br />\ndiscuss his job program on<br />\ncampus, \"among other things.\"<br />\n<br />\nMEET THREE<br />\nPEOPLE WHO FOUND<br />\nCAREERS WITH NSA.<br />\nELECTRONIC ENGINEER<br />\nAs a college student faced with finding a job and starting a<br />\ncareer you are presented many options.

Since the men<br />\n(and perhaps the women) who make up the<br />\nstudent body of this University will be<br />\nthe people directly affected by such a<br />\nmove, it is tempting to take the narrow<br />\nview. Very tempting... and equally wrong.<br />\nIn his State of the Union address<br />\nWednesday night, President Carter emphasized the fact that at this point in history,<br />\nthe fate of America is intimately bound up<br />\nwith the fate of many faraway nations.<br />\nThe Persian Gull and the Straits of Hormuz<br />\nare just as far away as Vietnam, and<br />\nthe distances, both geographically and<br />\nculturally, make their vital importance to<br />\nevery facet of our lives hard to envision.<br />\nNevertheless, our dependence on their<br />\nindependence is an undeniable fact -- and<br />\nignoring facts for the sake of a short-term<br />\nillusion of safety is the surest road to<br />\nlong-term peril.<br />\nOne of the fundamental things which<br />\nanyone who has received a college education should know is that generalizations are<br />\n<br />\ndangerous, and every situation must be<br />\njudged on its own merits. It may be a<br />\nbitter pill for many undergrads to swallow,<br />\nbut the 60's are otter. (As a matter of fact<br />\nthe 70's have bitten the dust as well.) The<br />\ncurrent world situation is by no means the<br />\nsame as it was fifteen years ago, and<br />\nindividuals must _formulate their opinions<br />\nabout military service anew. There seems<br />\nto be a feeling around campus that students<br />\nmust necessarily be opposed to any resurrection of Selective Service, as if anti-military sentiment was a required course. Such<br />\nshallow, self-serving avoidance of considering the issues is an excuse we employ at our<br />\nperil.<br />\nRegistration is necessary. The armed<br />\nforces of the United States are at this<br />\nmoment understrengthed by approximately 800,000 !rpm, and each week the<br />\ndeterence which only a strong military can<br />\nprovide becomes increasingly vital. Anyone who thinks he is protecting his individual rights or guaranteeing the continuence<br />\nof his accustomed way of life by opposing<br />\nregistration is suffering from a serious case<br />\nof moral near-sightedness.<br />\n<br />\nMore The Merrier<br />\n<br />\nAc you can see, to celebrate the beginning<br />\na new decade, the News-Letter has<br />\ncnanged its format and graced its cover<br />\nwith an appropriate photo. We are pleased<br />\nwith the changes, but at the same time we<br />\nrealize that such cosmetic surgery does not<br />\na newspaper make. Appearances are important, but what really counts is the quality<br />\nof the writing.<br />\nThere is never a week when all the<br />\npeople whose names are listed in the staff<br />\nbox actually contribute - so that appearance, at least, is deceiving. The fact of the<br />\nmatter is that we just don't have enough<br />\n<br />\npeople to make the News-Letter the kind<br />\nof paper we would truly like it to be.<br />\nToward remedying this situation, we are<br />\nhaving an open-house this Saturday at 2<br />\nPM. We urge everyone - fans and detractors<br />\n- to come on down, sip some brew, get<br />\ninvolved, and change the paper for the<br />\nbetter. We need photographers, ad people,<br />\ntypists (who, incidentally, get paid) and<br />\nlay-out personnel. And of course writers -any kind of writers:<br />\nnews, features,<br />\nentertainment, sports, and quizmakers. If<br />\nyou've ever thought to yourself, \"Hey, I<br />\ncan do a better job than those idiots ,\"<br />\nnow is your chance to prove it.<br />\n<br />\nDissent<br />\n<br />\nKill The Draft<br />\nBY PETER CINQUEGRANI<br />\n<br />\nThe young men of this<br />\ncountry and perhaps the young<br />\nwomen, too, face the prospect<br />\nof involuntary military service to<br />\ntheir country.<br />\nThe move to reinstitute<br />\nregistration for the selective<br />\nservice system comes as one of a<br />\nseries of moves designed to<br />\ndemonstrate America's will to<br />\nstand up to the Soviet Union.<br />\nCitizens' lives and happiness<br />\nshould not be pieces in their<br />\nown government's strategic chess<br />\ngame.<br />\nTo believe that it is possible<br />\nto have registration without the<br />\ndraft following is to believe that<br />\nyou can be almost pregnant. Yet<br />\nthe draft was one of the most<br />\ndisruptive forces in American<br />\nsociety. Any system which tries<br />\nto pick who will fight will have<br />\nbuilt-in inequalities. College deferments would result in a<br />\nworking-class Army defending<br />\nthe middle class at home. Yet, it<br />\nis important to continue producing educated minds and<br />\nprofessionals.<br />\nAny system which forces<br />\n<br />\nmen to do what they do not<br />\nwant to do is one of involuntary<br />\nservitude--slavery. To force<br />\nsomeone to fight when they<br />\ndo not want to is wrong. If<br />\nAmerica is worth defending, it<br />\nmust be worth defending because you wish to, not because<br />\nthe government forces you to.<br />\nPatriots cannot be drafted;<br />\nthey would already have joined.<br />\nIn peace time draftees are never<br />\nhappy or good soldiers. They do<br />\nnot have the esprit de corps<br />\nnecessary to form part of an<br />\neffective fighting force.<br />\nThere is a basic contradiction in the draft in America. In<br />\npeacetime, when soldiers do no<br />\nfighting, the public does not<br />\nsupport the draft and draftees<br />\nare unwilling to serve. However,<br />\nduring times of crisis, when<br />\nsoldiers are needed, the population is willing to support the<br />\ndraft and even upstages it by<br />\nenlisting. When the draft is most<br />\nneeded in crises, it is not necessary to bring the men in, while<br />\nin peacetime when soldiers are<br />\nnot fighting, the draft is not<br />\neffective.<br />\ncont. un p. 8<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editor<br />\nCouncil a Dud<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAgain, it seems the Student<br />\nCouncil is unable to hear the<br />\ncries of the commoners (their<br />\ncolleagues) way up in their white<br />\npalace in the clouds, I queryWhere is the JHU Student<br />\nCouncil?<br />\nI was highly disappointed,<br />\nalong with many other students,<br />\nthat the Intersession course list<br />\nwas so limited.

While it<br />\nwas well written and substantially correct, a few points need to<br />\nbe clarified. First, the NSF grant<br />\nwas awarded in September,1979,<br />\ni.e., this year not last. Secondly,<br />\nwhile I was the principal investigator on the NSF grant, Dr.<br />\nRobert Benbow helped me write<br />\nit and will co-direct the expenditure of funds. Since the article<br />\nsubmitted to the News-Letter by<br />\nMs. Rosen at least aeluded (SIC)<br />\nto Dr. Be nbow's contribution,<br />\nelimination of his name must<br />\nhave been either an editorial<br />\ndecision or a typesetting error. I<br />\nfeel Dr. Benbow's participation<br />\nwas critical to the success of the<br />\nNSF proposal and his contribution should be recognized.<br />\nFinally, both the title and<br />\nthe first paragraph uses the<br />\nplural \"grants\".

A right bunch of hooligans they were.<br />\nFinally paying our quid and making it inside, we<br />\nstopped first at the bog and then proceeded to our stalls.<br />\nI tried to pull a cheeky little bird on the way, but it<br />\nturned out she was with some ace face, and the prat told<br />\nmc to shut me gob and leave off his piece. He looked a<br />\nmite pissed, and didn't appear to be bolockin' about.<br />\nNever one to fancy being knocked on me burn, I complied.<br />\nAfter liggering about for a while, I reckoned it<br />\nwas time to take the tube back to Brixton. What, and<br />\nmiss seeing the Who, you say?<br />\n<br />\nBloody well right, mate. Y'see, I figured you<br />\nwere getting bleedin' tired of reading British slang.<br />\nBut I'm a substitute for another guy<br />\nI look pretty tall but my heels are high...<br />\n\"Substitute\"<br />\nFunny how a legend can arise from basic insecurity.<br />\n\"When I was in school the geezers that were<br />\nsnappy dressers 3nd got chicks like years before I ever<br />\nthought they existed, would always like to talk about<br />\nmy nose,\" Pete Townshend admitted in a 1968 Rolling<br />\nStone interview. \"This seemed to be the biggest thing in<br />\nmy life: my fucking nose, man. Whenever my dad got<br />\ndrunk, he'd come up to me and say, 'Look son, you<br />\nknow looks aren't everything' and shit like this.<br />\n\" It was huge. At that time, it was the reason I<br />\ndid everything. It's the reason I played the guitar--because of my nose.<br />\n\"What I wanted to do was distract attention<br />\nfrom my nose to my body and make people look at my<br />\nbody, instead of at my face--turn my body into a machine,\" he said.<br />\nLikewise, Townshend's patented onstage histrionics were initially used as a strategy to camouflage<br />\nother shortcomings of his--those as a guitarist.<br />\n\"I used to try and make up visually for what I<br />\ncouldn't play as a musician,\" he revealed. \"I'd hold my<br />\narm up in the air and bring it down so it looked really<br />\nlethal, even if it didn't sound too lethal.<br />\n\"I became a huge visual thing,\" he said. \"In<br />\nfact I forgot all about the guitar because my visual thing<br />\nwas more my music than the actual guitar. I got to jump<br />\nabout and the guitar became unimportant.\"<br />\nThe story of Peter's first guitar demolition has<br />\nbefore, but it bears repeating.<br />\ntold<br />\nbeen<br />\n\"It happened by, complete accident the first<br />\ntime,\" Townshend recalled. \"We were just kicking<br />\naround in a club which we played every Tuesday and I<br />\nwas playing the guitar and it hit the ceiling. It broke and<br />\nit kind of shocked me 'cause I wasn't ready for it to<br />\n,<br />\ngo.<br />\n'And I was expecting an incredible thing, it<br />\nbeing so precious to me, and I was expecting everybody<br />\nto go, Wow, he's broken his, guitar, he's broken his<br />\nguitar,' but nobody did anything, which made me kind<br />\nof angry in a way, and determined to get this precious<br />\nevent noticed by the audience. I proceeded to make a<br />\nbig thing of breaking the guitar. I pounded all over the<br />\nstage with it and I threw the bits on the stage and I<br />\npicked up my spare guitar and carried on as though I<br />\nreally meant to do it.\"<br />\nThe following week, the club was packed, and<br />\nthe ceremonial sacrifice of a six-stringed instrument<br />\nwould soon be an integral part of the Who concert<br />\nexperience.<br />\nWhen I was in the seventh grade, I wrote a letter<br />\nto Townshend, explaining to him how much the Who<br />\nmeant to me, and making a small request. Instead of<br />\nbusting up your guitar tonight, I reasoned, why not<br />\nsimply pretend you did and then mail it to me?<br />\nNow we all know how much individual guitars<br />\nmeant to Pete-virtually nothing. We also knows how<br />\nmuch be cares for the kids, the up-arid -coming rock<br />\n<br />\n\fand rollers. So it follows that the guitar arrived in the<br />\nmail shortly thereafter, right?<br />\nWrong. It still hasn't gotten here. Looking at the<br />\nsituation logically, then, either a.) Peter never received<br />\nthe letter, or b.) My mailman's son is, at this very<br />\nmoment, jamming away contentedly on a cherry red<br />\nGibson SG.<br />\nAnd I never have trusted that mailman.<br />\nYou were under the impression<br />\nThat when you were walking forward<br />\nYou'd end up further onward<br />\nBut things ain't quite that simple...<br />\n\"I've Had Enough\"<br />\n<br />\nPetWirer<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore Poseur In \\ i<br />\nResponsible<br />\n\\Held<br />\nConcert Deaths<br />\nRock<br />\nA2 The<br />\n<br />\nBaltiinOre<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\nalleged<br />\ntoda<br />\naddition, it is<br />\nthe<br />\nIn<br />\nfrom<br />\nKinney \\for t<br />\nannounced to- that footprints<br />\nques- suspect's size 121h. found Iwas<br />\n1<br />\nThe FBI<br />\nbeen<br />\nthey are<br />\n' new!<br />\nday that Maryland citizen loafers have<br />\nbacks of all<br />\nMon- embedded in the<br />\na<br />\ntioning<br />\nwith<br />\n\\<br />\nconnection<br />\n::e\"<br />\na<br />\nvictims.<br />\ntragedy at<br />\neleven<br />\nwriter. was '.1,11talk!<br />\nin<br />\nConsidine, a<br />\nnight's<br />\nCincinnati, '\u2018<br />\nI<br />\nam<br />\nday<br />\nall.\"Who<br />\nconcert in<br />\nwere \\<br />\nanybody's Cint<br />\nto deny<br />\n' rock Fleven persons<br />\nI quick<br />\nand<br />\non<br />\nOhio.<br />\nstep<br />\nincident.<br />\nto<br />\nasked.<br />\nas imp<br />\nkilled in the Considine, 23,\\ rights'!\" he<br />\nI'm<br />\n\"Believe me,<br />\nJohn D.<br />\nthis<br />\nbeing held<br />\nanybody by<br />\nTowson, is<br />\nadded. to TI<br />\ncrushed as<br />\nof<br />\nhe<br />\nbail.<br />\nthing,\"<br />\nGordon<br />\nconcerts<br />\nwithout spokesman<br />\nwhole<br />\n'<br />\nthe<br />\nat rocksooner ot<br />\nFBI<br />\nreports thatGreat- \"Violence<br />\nedvinc<br />\nabhorrent, and going to Ila<br />\nThomas<br />\nthe<br />\n\\<br />\nat<br />\nsomebody's<br />\nfoot Goi<br />\nsuspect arrived International is<br />\ntater,<br />\ntheir<br />\nCincinnati<br />\nMon- I<br />\nto put,<br />\nCI<br />\n5:45<br />\nas f<br />\n830 \\ have<br />\n/<br />\nAirport at<br />\ndown.\"<br />\ndepart at<br />\n1<br />\nonly toconcert, starring \\<br />\n-.4.3/<br />\nI day ,<br />\nThe<br />\nI<br />\n. p.m\u2022English rock group,<br />\n' the<br />\nbegan at<br />\n\u202245.1-7.-1111,0- -<br />\n<br />\ntive individual, Townshend has traditionally come to<br />\ngrips with his problems through religion. Hopefully, his<br />\nmaster, Meher Baba, will once again be able to provide<br />\nhim with answers.<br />\nIn 1977, when Townshend feared that rock and<br />\nroll was on the brink of death, he sunk into a deep<br />\ndepression, and it was only his relationship with Meher<br />\nBaba that pulled him through. Several months later, he<br />\npenned a detailed account of his struggles for Rolling<br />\nStone. Here is an excerpt:<br />\nMy crisis was caused by no one and<br />\nnothing. It cost me nothing,. it gives me<br />\neverything. It was never precipitated<br />\nbecause precipitation is a slow process.<br />\nThere was no waiting for time to take its<br />\ncourse, or for me to weigh up whether I<br />\nwas doing right or wrong. Rock & roll<br />\nalways tries to do right. Rock & roll<br />\nalways aims high and offers itself up as<br />\nthe tinderwood to the fire that will burn<br />\naway the crap in this world. Rock & roll<br />\nuses up people, music and talent, even<br />\ngenius, like balsa in a roaring inferno...<br />\nThe right is that it tries, the wrong is that<br />\nit often fails.<br />\nIf it failed in Cincinnati, we surely can't place the<br />\nblame on the Who.<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nAll joking aside, it's a shame that the tragedy in<br />\nCincinnati had to cast a shadow over the Who's entire<br />\nAmerican tour:One must sympathize not only with the<br />\nfamilies of the victims, but with the Who as well. For<br />\nafter all the Who have given to rock and roll, they<br />\ndeserve more out of it than this.<br />\n\"Initially, we felt stunned and empty,\" says lead<br />\nsinger Roger Daltrey. \"We felt we couldn't go on. But<br />\nyou gotta. There's no point in stopping.\"<br />\n\"I don't think we could have cancelled if we'd<br />\nwanted to,\" bassist John Entwistle maintains.\"We were<br />\ncontracted to play.\"<br />\nIt's difficult to say what kind of effect the<br />\ncatastrophe has had on Pete Townshend; most likely, he<br />\nfeels responsible to a certain degree. A deeply introspecListening to you I get the music<br />\nGazing at you I get the heat ...<br />\n\"We're Not Gonna Take It!\"<br />\nA strange buzz filtered through the Capitol<br />\nCentre, and it was charged with electricity. It was the<br />\nrealization that this would probably be the only concert<br />\nthis winter that would mean anything. It was the hope<br />\nthat the boys could bounce back from adversity and pull<br />\none more miracle out of the rock and roll fire.<br />\nIt was the return of the Who.<br />\nYeah, maybe you should have been home studying for that final exam, but since when does school take<br />\nprecedence over the Who? This was to be the Who's first<br />\nvisit since 1976, and there were questions to be answered:<br />\nAfter Cincinnati, would the group merely be<br />\ngoing through the motions?<br />\nWould Kenny Jones prove to be a suitable<br />\nreplacement for Keith Moon?<br />\nHow effectively would a horn section and a<br />\nkeyboardist mesh with the group?<br />\nWould the Who be looking back to the sixties, or<br />\nahead to the eighties?<br />\nClearly, many in the audience faced towards the<br />\nsixties. \"Man, I could really get into seeing Townshend<br />\nsmash his guitar,\" one glassy-eyed youth observed in the<br />\nmen's room before the show. One long toke off a PCP<br />\njoint later, he added,\"He smashed it in Cincinnati, you<br />\nknow. Like, it would really flip my head out to see him<br />\ndo it tonight.\"<br />\nActually, apart from a 1978 concert (Moon's last)<br />\nfilmed in London for \"The Kids Are Alright,\" Pete<br />\nTownshend hasn't obliterated a guitar in years. Still,<br />\nafter every show, it's inevitable that some people will go<br />\nhome disappointed because they haven't witnessed any<br />\n<br />\ndestruction.<br />\nAn albatross hangs from Townshend's neck, and<br />\nhow to remove the damn thing is anybody's guess.<br />\nNo, the Who didn't die before they got old-\"We're still working on it,\" laughs Townshend--but<br />\nfortunately, they realize it.<br />\n\"I'm 34 years old, my hair's getting thin, and l'm<br />\nnot gonna stand up on a stage like some 16-year-old kid<br />\n,and rock out all night and pretend that I can actually<br />\nhandle it,\" Pete said recently on the King Biscuit Flower<br />\nHour. \"I can only do so much.\"<br />\nThat goes for the recording studio as well.<br />\nThe last two Who albums have been, for the most<br />\npart, fairly mundane affairs.Save for the title track and a<br />\ncouple of Entwistle's numbers, Who Are You was<br />\napproximately as exciting as a date with Karen Ann<br />\nQuinlan.<br />\nBut the Who have always been known, first and<br />\nforemost, as a live act\u2014the definitive live act, many<br />\nsay\u2014and consequently their overall reputation hasn't<br />\nbeen tarnished.<br />\nFor the time being, it shall remain that way.<br />\nAt 8:45, the lights went down, a roar came up,<br />\nand there they were: The Who. With an exhilarating<br />\ncrunch of chords, they kicked into \"Substitute\" and<br />\n19,000 fans were on their feet.<br />\nFor the next two hours, Capitol Centre patrons<br />\nwere treated to the most glorious spectacle that contemporary rock music has to offer.<br />\nThere was Daltrey in the center, marching in<br />\nplace, slinging his microphone like a lariat and belting<br />\nout those lyrics ferociously.<br />\nTownshend patroled the right side of the stage,<br />\nleaping exuberently and sending out windmill chord.<br />\nsmashes by the dozen. If he was feeling down in the<br />\ndumps, he kept it well hidden.<br />\nJohn Entwisle was his usual staid self, looking as<br />\nif his feet were stuck in cement and executing lightningquick, dive-bomber bass runs.<br />\nBehind his drum kit, Kenny Jones was hardly<br />\nnoticeable, having skilfully adapted himself to the<br />\ngroup's repertoire. Only occasionally, such as in \"My<br />\nGeneration,\" was it apparent that an old friend was<br />\nmissing.<br />\nThe three-man brass section was used unobtrusively in \"Music Must Change\" (probably the weakest<br />\nnumber in the set) as well as in a few other tunes, ani.1 as<br />\none Who fan put it, \"They were great, precisely because<br />\nyou couldn't hear 'em.\"<br />\nNewest group member John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick<br />\nadded some tasty keyboard embellishments to the<br />\nproceedings, but generally stayed out of the spotlight as<br />\nwell.<br />\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the evening came<br />\nduring the first encore, \"Summertime Blues,\" when<br />\nTownshend lost his balance during one of his leaps and<br />\nlanded unceremoniously on his backside.<br />\nSomehow it's reassuring to discover that the Who<br />\nare almost as human as the rest of us.<br />\nFollowing an awe-inspiring rendition of the<br />\nclassic \"Won't Get Fooled Again,\" Townshend and Daltrey<br />\nembraced, and Pete surprised everyone by planting a kiss<br />\non the lead singer's cheek. After years of open warfare<br />\nbetween the two, it was a heart-warming sight.<br />\nIn the end, it was obvious that the Who can still<br />\ndeliver the goods. Though they've taken more than theii<br />\nshare of lumps, they've come back swinging.

Pp. 271. $10.95.<br />\nAvailable at the JHU Bookcenter.<br />\nFabian is Jerzy Kozinski's character study of a man with wanderlust in<br />\nmodern society. Passion Play is the series<br />\nof events in Fabian's ride through the<br />\npolo fields of life.<br />\nA skilled polo player,jumper, and<br />\nauthor, Fabian travels alone in his van<br />\naround the United States in search of<br />\nteaching positions and one-on-one polo<br />\nmatches. His humanitarian equestrian<br />\nideas, which will make him a hero for<br />\nanimal lovers, are vividly described in<br />\ntypical Kosinski fashion:<br />\nAs the rider spurred his mount to<br />\npush off its foreleg crashed on the turf,<br />\nshattering the bone just below the knee.<br />\nThe pony, foaming in its frenzy, kept at<br />\nthe gallop, its splintered leg buckling, a<br />\nbare bone protruding at every footfall,<br />\nuntil, staggering, the animal pitched and<br />\nstumbled. Only then did the rider, as<br />\nfrenzied and possessed as his mount,<br />\nbecome aware of what had taken place.<br />\nTraveling in his van, Fabian is able<br />\nto gain the transient. freedom once<br />\npossessed by the cowboy or the explorer.<br />\nMuch like the character of Goldmund in<br />\n<br />\nNarcissus and Goldmund by Hesse,<br />\nFabian values his freedom above all else,<br />\nrejecting the security of marriage or a<br />\nsteady job. Kosinski uses Fabian to show<br />\nthat a free wanderer can survive in<br />\nAmerica today. Mistrusting medicine and<br />\ntechnology, and loving the woodland,<br />\nFabian is the Don Quixote of this disappearing lifestyle. Kosinski makes this<br />\nparallel in Fabian's countless horseback<br />\nriding scenes. In one case, Kosinski<br />\ndescribes Fabian riding \"as if charging<br />\nwith a lance, in combat with an enemy<br />\nonly he can see.\"<br />\nAs a transient, Fabian suffers<br />\nfrom the problems typical of wanderers,<br />\nthe most prevalent being the need for<br />\nsexual fulfillment. Fabian's sexual frustration is well represented by Kosinski's<br />\ndescription of a booth in Latin America<br />\nwhere a girl behind a glass wall strips<br />\nfarther and farther as more quarters are<br />\nadded. When Fabian does find a partner,<br />\nhe is as free as in the bed as he is in life.<br />\nHis sexual encounters range from sadomasochism and bestiality with his horses<br />\nto a love trio with a girl and partial<br />\ntranssexual.<br />\nAnother problem Fabian faces is<br />\nthe onset of old age.

Some<br />\nalso examine the role of the media,<br />\nespecially television, in depersonalizing<br />\nrelationships and anihilating individuality-- in Apocalypse Now, the titillating<br />\nPlayboy bunny show that dangles a<br />\nchoice bit of pre-packaged American<br />\nfemininity in front of the sex-starved<br />\nsoldiers and then yanks it away, and in<br />\nDown and Dirty, the senile grandmother<br />\nwho stares at a T.V. set all day parroting<br />\nEnglish words.<br />\nThe Electric Horseman, the<br />\ncurrent Redford-Fonda vehicle, also<br />\nmakes use of this theme. Redford plays<br />\nSonny Steele, a \"five-time-all-around<br />\ncowboy,\" who has traded the bruises and<br />\nbroken bones of the rodeo for the safe,<br />\nrich and comfortable existence as a cereal<br />\npromoter. Though the film shows little of<br />\nSteele's cowboy life, we see the transition<br />\nfrom real to \"electric\" cowboy in a series<br />\nof still frames and episodic sequences: an<br />\nadvertising artist pencilling a moustache<br />\non a photo of Steele's clean-shaven face,<br />\nSteele sporting the moustache and<br />\ngrinning for publicity shots, Steele<br />\npitching cereal. The first time we really<br />\nmeet Steele, he is slouched in a corner,<br />\ndrunk, and his two friends are trying to<br />\npush his boot on and get him onto the<br />\nhorse he has to ride around the stadium.<br />\nSteele mounts the horse with difficulty,<br />\nsomeone flips the switch that electrifies<br />\nhis costume, and, after a shortride, Steele<br />\nfalls from the horse with an inebriated<br />\nsmile. He has become no more than a<br />\n\"cereal cowboy\" and has lost all<br />\nself-respect.<br />\n<br />\nWestern<br />\n<br />\nBut, unlike the movies mentioned<br />\nabove, The Electric Horseman does not<br />\nend in a pit of despair. Steele finds a<br />\ncause-- an ex-race horse bought by the<br />\nsame corporation that bought him, shot<br />\nup with drugs and steroids, and reduced<br />\nto a symbol-- and becomes the man he<br />\nused to be. Nally Martin (Jane Fonda)<br />\nundergoes a similar transformation. A<br />\nslick T.V. reporter, Martin tracks down<br />\nSteele to get her story but quickly<br />\nbecomes his friend and lover as she helps<br />\nhim lead the horse to an isolated canyon<br />\nwhere he sets the horse free. Martin<br />\nwrites on her notepad about Steele's<br />\n\"private goal\" and a sense of \"fairness\"\u2014<br />\nand really means it.<br />\nAs Sonny Steele and Hally Martin,<br />\nRedford and Fonda are well suited to<br />\ntheir parts. Redford, a knowledgeable<br />\nenvironmentalist who owns .a lot of<br />\nland out West is excellent in outdoors<br />\nroles. He plays Steele with honesty,<br />\nsincerity, modesty, and a sense of humor.<br />\nDespite all his drunken bouts and<br />\noverexposure to the media, Redford's<br />\nSteele remains kind and good. Fonda,<br />\nwho can play both cowgirls (Comes a<br />\nHorseman) and big city journalists, is<br />\nconvincing here. Her Hally Martin is<br />\nrarely a caricature, and the little girl<br />\ninside her is sweet and touching.<br />\nThe Electric Horseman is a<br />\nthoroughly American movie. The sense of<br />\nright and wrong\u2014 unnatural and natural-are mirrored in the difference between<br />\nthe neon lights of the flashy Las Vegas<br />\ncasino where Steele steals the horse from<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br />\n<br />\nz<br />\n<br />\nand erupts in every scene.

TAYLOR<br />\nMiss Teenage Arkansas, Hieronymous Bosch, Jesus, and a lesbian motorcycle gang all appear in the slim booklet<br />\ncalled Ampersand that is making its debut<br />\nthis week at Homewood. Ampersand is a<br />\ncollection of ten poems and twelve pieces<br />\nof fiction put together by freshmen<br />\nLisa Ginsburg, Doug MilleroNancy Ring,<br />\nand Cay Whitley.<br />\nRing wanted to create a magazine<br />\nwith no cover charge that would function<br />\nas a forum for student creative expression. She felt the campus needed a<br />\npublication that was simple to produce<br />\nand quick to reach its audience. Though<br />\nRing has had little experience in publishing, she was able to put out 250 issues of<br />\nAmpersand in about a month at a cost of<br />\n$133.<br />\nAt first glimpse Ampersand presents itself as a sort of mystery. Each<br />\npiece is credited, but with neither an<br />\neditor's note nor a table of contents the<br />\nmagazine might have sprung into existence by spontaneous generation. According to Ring, the contents were not<br />\nlisted because so much of the work was<br />\nuntitled. Ring explained that she left the<br />\nmagazine without an introduction or<br />\ncomment because she din't want to give<br />\nreaders any preconcieved ideas. \"I want<br />\npeople to take it as it is,\" she said.<br />\nRing is very happy with the final<br />\nproduct though she describes it as being<br />\n\"in its infancy.\" A diverse array of<br />\nwriters appear in the issue. Most of the<br />\ncontributors are freshmen, but several<br />\nupperclassmen and a graduate student are<br />\nalso represented. Only about half the<br />\nwriters are actually writing majors. The<br />\n<br />\ncontents are equally varied. The poems<br />\nrange in structure from sonnets to free<br />\nverse. Several pieces of fiction are directly<br />\nwritten short stories like Doug Miller's<br />\nMiss Teenage Arkansas. Others such as<br />\nCay Whitley's fiction verge on prose<br />\npoetry.<br />\nThe work in Ampersand is generally interesting and well-written. Of<br />\nspecial note are the poems, Bosch in<br />\nParadise by Mandy Levine and Rough *z<br />\nSketch by Nancy Ring. Both are sensitively written and at times impulsive. Their The lovely and talented Katy Evans assumes center stage in The Barnstormers' latest,<br />\n_<br />\nimagery unfolds in an imaginative and<br />\nsurprising way.

The Committee<br />\nconsists of five faculty members<br />\nand four students.<br />\nThe proposal to begin<br />\nplus/minus grading was first<br />\nforwarded last year and passed<br />\nunanimously by the CUS. Subsequently, students were given<br />\nthe opportunity to express their<br />\nfeelings on plus/minus grading in<br />\na referendum. Students voted<br />\nagainst the plan 60-40. The CUS<br />\nthen moved to reconsider the<br />\noriginal motion on plus/minus<br />\ngrading.<br />\nThe plan currently under<br />\nconsideration was set forth by<br />\nJames Walker of the Physics<br />\ndepartment. In discussion before<br />\nthe CUS, Walker said he supported the plan because he<br />\nfelt that it would reduce competition. lie said that lie has had<br />\nnumerous requests to regrade<br />\nsince one point can make the<br />\ndifference between a grade that<br />\nis almost an A or nearly a C with<br />\nno means of differentiating<br />\nmore closely. He stated that<br />\nthere was legitimate uncertainty<br />\namong faculty members in assigning borderline grades when<br />\nsuch large gradations are at<br />\nstake.<br />\nWalker also noted that the<br />\nlack of plus/minus grading has<br />\nbeen detrimental to Hopkins<br />\nstudents applying to graduate or<br />\nprofessional schools. A number<br />\nof the better schools have always<br />\nhad plus/minus grading, and<br />\nothers have now moved back to<br />\nthat system. He expressed the<br />\nfeeling that if grades are to be<br /><br />\ngiven at all they should be as<br />\nmeaningful as possible.<br />\nDean Hooker indicated that<br />\nhe agrees with Walker's reasoning, but felt that the students<br />\nwere approaching the proposal<br />\nas an emotional issue, preferring<br />\nthe \"familiar evil\" of whole<br />\ngrades to the uncertainty of<br />\nplus/minus grading.<br />\nIn further discussion, Professor Hall of the Psychology<br />\ndepartment pointed out that the<br />\nfaculty has had no hidden<br />\ninterest in the plus/minus system, that they were motivated<br />\nby the feeling that it is in the<br />\nbest interests of the students.<br />\nShe noted that the system was<br />\nnot less troublesome for the<br />\nfaculty, but they simply feel it is<br />\nnot fair.<br />\nA motion by Robert Elkin<br />\nand George Connolly to rescind<br />\nlast year's committee motion in<br />\nfavor of the plus/minus system<br />\nfailed, seven to two.<br />\nMathematical Sciences Professor Karr moved that the<br />\nfollowing system of grading be<br />\nadopted for all students in<br />\nSeptember of 1980, or as soon as<br />\nit is feasable: A=4.0, A-=3.7,<br />\nB+=3.3, B=3.0, 13-=2.7, C+=2.3,<br />\nC=2.0, C-=1.7, D=1.0, F=0. D+,<br />\nD- and A+ are not being considered so that the 4.0 scale<br />\ncan be retained. The motion was<br />\npassed, seven in favor, none<br />\nopposed and two abstaining.<br />\nThe motion will now go to<br />\nthe Academic Council, made up<br />\nof 12 faculty members with all<br />\nthe full deans as ex-officio<br />\nmembers and Steven Muller<br />\nchairman.The<br />\nex-officio<br />\nas<br />\nCouncil has the final authority<br />\non the issue.<br />\nThe Student Council has<br />\nalready expressed its opposition<br />\nto the grading change.

The<br />\ndepartment is presently located<br />\nin Latrobe Hall, where space and<br />\nfacilities have become inade-quate. Particularly lacking are<br />\nclassrooms<br />\nand<br />\nteaching<br />\nlabs..Space is now used in Ames<br />\nand Macauley halls to fulfill the<br />\ndepartment's needs.<br />\nEstimated construction cost<br />\nfor the new building is<br />\n$5,164,302. An anonymous<br />\ndonor will pay $4,782,102. and<br /><br />\nReports Say Muller In Running<br />\nFor Berkeley's Chancellorship<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br />\nA University of California at<br />\nBerkeley selections committee<br />\nhas narrowed its choices for<br />\nchancellorship to four men,<br />\nincluding Johns Hopkins University president Steven Muller. The<br />\nchancellorship is roughly equivalent to the president's job at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, encompassing<br />\ncontrol of all Berkeley institutions.<br />\nThe rumor has met with<br />\nunanimous denial by administration sources on the Homewood<br />\ncampus, who contend that Muller is not interested in the<br />\npost.<br />\nMuller, in Europe until<br /><br />\nJanuary 29, is unavailable for<br />\ncomment.<br />\nMuller's name is one of<br />\n\"hundreds\" initially examined<br />\nfor the job according to a report<br />\npublished in the January 15<br />\nedition of the Daily Californian,<br />\nBerkeley's student newspaper.<br />\nThe first group of ii persons<br />\nchosen did not include Muller.<br />\nHis name was added to a second,<br />\nmore select group.<br />\nThe other candidates are<br />\nBerkeley vice-chancellor Ira M.<br />\nHeyman, Berkeley's business<br />\nschool dean Earl Cheit, and<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania provost Barton Gregorian.<br />\nThe Berkeley selections<br />\ncont. on p.5<br /><br />\nthe University is to pay the<br />\nremaining $382,000. After completion, estimated operating expenses will be $140,000 a year.<br />\nThis sum will be added to Plant<br />\nOperations' budget.<br />\nThe building itself will be<br />\napproximately 47,000 square<br />\nfeet. Though not using the<br />\nGeorgian design prevalent on<br />\ncampus, the building will be<br />\nconstructed of red brick and<br />\ncement. According to Mark<br />\nBeck, president of Mark Beck<br />\nand Associates, the firm that<br />\nplanned the building, it has been<br />\ndesigned to be as energy effici\u2014<br />\nent as possible. The three-story<br />\nstructure will be built into<br />\nthe side of a hill so that from the<br />\neast only the top floor will be<br />\nvisible while the first three floors<br />\nwill be visible from the north<br />\nand west.<br />\nWhen E &amp; PS moves out of<br />\nLatrobe Hall, that building will<br />\nbe renovated to house the<br />\nSchool of Engineering. There are.<br />\npresently 14 faculty members,<br />\n55 graduate students and 25<br />\ndepartmental majors (under.<br />\ngrads)in E &amp; PS. The avei age<br />\nclass now consists of 6-12 students. George Fisher, chairman<br />\nof the department, would like to<br />\nsee the number of undergrads<br />\ndouble. Both faculty and students in the department feel that<br />\nthis doubling would not be a<br />\nburden. There are no plans to<br />\nincrease overall enrollment to<br />\naccomplish this; Fisher hopes<br />\nthat these students will come<br />\nfrom among the \"undecideds\"<br />\nand premeds.<br />\nIn addition to the increase<br />\nin undergraduate enrollment, Dr.<br />\nFisher hopes that with new lab<br />\nfacilities, his department can<br />\nattract more junior faculty. Dr.<br />\nOwen Phillips, also of E &amp; PS,<br />\nbelieves that new lab facilities<br />\nmay attract young faculty, but<br />\nsees JHU junior faculty salaries<br />\nas the key reason they are so<br />\ndifficult to obtain. Phillips explained that a young Ph.D. in<br />\nGeolow can easily find a job<br />\npaying double what 1HU offers<br /><br />\nin research for corporations. In<br />\naddition to salaries, job security<br />\nand advancement are are also<br />\nbetter in business research than<br />\nat JHU.<br />\nThe building plans were first<br />\nshown to the public at a meeting<br />\nof community group representatives on November 19, 1979.<br />\nHopkins had received a verbal<br />\nO.K. from the anonymous donor<br />\nto draw up plans in October. On<br />\nDecember 9, a group from JHU,<br />\nincluding Dea Kline, head of<br />\nCommunity Affairs, and William<br />\nCampbell, in charge of Physical<br />\nSpace Planning and Plant<br />\nOperations, addressed an open<br />\nmeeting of the Wyman Park<br />\nAssociation. Those present generally agreed that though this<br />\nparticular structure was designed<br />\nwith concern for the environment, they were opposed to any<br />\nbuildings in Wyman Park, which<br />\nincludes West Campus by their<br />\ndefinition.<br />\nAt a meeting of the Greater<br />\nHomewood Community Corporation (GHCC)on Januay 16, the<br />\nHopkins delegation presented<br />\nthe plans again. James Carbine.<br />\npreseident of the Wyman Park<br />\nAssociation, declared his opposition to the planned construction, saying, \"We hold this park<br />\nin trust for the future.\".

The proposed<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences<br />\nbuilding is controversial because<br />\nthe Wyman Park Commmunity<br />\nAssociation opposes the extension and will take legal action on<br />\nthe grounds of deed stipulations.<br />\nThe Greater Homewood Community Corporation (GHCC) favored the construction of the<br />\nbuilding by a 10-3 margin,<br />\nwith a Hopkins representative<br />\nvoting with the majority. Council members challenged the<br />\nHopkins vote and pointed out<br />\nthat the administration did not<br />\nsolicit input from students or<br />\nthe community prior to adopting plans for the building.<br />\nIn other business, George<br />\nConnolly, president of the S.C.,<br />\nexpressed his concern over attendance at the meetings. Rather<br />\nthan personally asking members<br />\nwho attend infrequently to<br /><br />\nresign, Connolly stated that he<br />\nwill bring up the matter before<br />\nthe Council in the future.<br />\nTreasurer Karl Block made. a<br />\npresentation on the Council's<br />\nfinancial status. It was pointed<br />\nout that the Council is financially better off than it has been in<br />\nthe past three years.

For the first time in<br />\nHopkins's history, a Cheerleading Association has been started.<br />\nThe Council is also considering<br />\nthe status of a Ba'hai Club and a<br />\nnew literary magazine called<br />\nAmpersand. The status of two<br />\nnon-partisan groups, Amnesty<br />\nInternational and the New Political Caucus, is also under<br />\nconsideration at this time, but it<br /><br />\nmay involve legal problems.<br />\nBlock emphasized that the<br />\nCouncil encourages participation<br />\nand will not turn any group<br />\naway without considering it.<br />\nBlock's statement included a<br />\nproposal to enact a \"major<br />\noverhaul of SAC Constitutions.\"<br />\nThe meeting ended after a<br />\nvote was taken on Goodfriend's<br />\nrequest that the meeting be<br />\nclosed to outsiders. The Council<br />\ndid not get the unanimous<br />\nvote needed and, therefore,<br />\nGoodfriend withdrew his statement. Evidently, Goodfriend<br />\nwanted to make a statement<br />\nabout his alleged resignation and<br />\nhis subsequent decision to stay<br />\nwith the Council.

Since the men<br />\n(and perhaps the women) who make up the<br />\nstudent body of this University will be<br />\nthe people directly affected by such a<br />\nmove, it is tempting to take the narrow<br />\nview. Very tempting... and equally wrong.<br />\nIn his State of the Union address<br />\nWednesday night, President Carter emphasized the fact that at this point in history,<br />\nthe fate of America is intimately bound up<br />\nwith the fate of many faraway nations.<br />\nThe Persian Gull and the Straits of Hormuz<br />\nare just as far away as Vietnam, and<br />\nthe distances, both geographically and<br />\nculturally, make their vital importance to<br />\nevery facet of our lives hard to envision.<br />\nNevertheless, our dependence on their<br />\nindependence is an undeniable fact -- and<br />\nignoring facts for the sake of a short-term<br />\nillusion of safety is the surest road to<br />\nlong-term peril.<br />\nOne of the fundamental things which<br />\nanyone who has received a college education should know is that generalizations are<br /><br />\ndangerous, and every situation must be<br />\njudged on its own merits. It may be a<br />\nbitter pill for many undergrads to swallow,<br />\nbut the 60's are otter. (As a matter of fact<br />\nthe 70's have bitten the dust as well.) The<br />\ncurrent world situation is by no means the<br />\nsame as it was fifteen years ago, and<br />\nindividuals must _formulate their opinions<br />\nabout military service anew. There seems<br />\nto be a feeling around campus that students<br />\nmust necessarily be opposed to any resurrection of Selective Service, as if anti-military sentiment was a required course. Such<br />\nshallow, self-serving avoidance of considering the issues is an excuse we employ at our<br />\nperil.<br />\nRegistration is necessary. The armed<br />\nforces of the United States are at this<br />\nmoment understrengthed by approximately 800,000 !rpm, and each week the<br />\ndeterence which only a strong military can<br />\nprovide becomes increasingly vital. Anyone who thinks he is protecting his individual rights or guaranteeing the continuence<br />\nof his accustomed way of life by opposing<br />\nregistration is suffering from a serious case<br />\nof moral near-sightedness.<br /><br />\nMore The Merrier<br /><br />\nAc you can see, to celebrate the beginning<br />\na new decade, the News-Letter has<br />\ncnanged its format and graced its cover<br />\nwith an appropriate photo. We are pleased<br />\nwith the changes, but at the same time we<br />\nrealize that such cosmetic surgery does not<br />\na newspaper make. Appearances are important, but what really counts is the quality<br />\nof the writing.<br />\nThere is never a week when all the<br />\npeople whose names are listed in the staff<br />\nbox actually contribute - so that appearance, at least, is deceiving. The fact of the<br />\nmatter is that we just don't have enough<br /><br />\npeople to make the News-Letter the kind<br />\nof paper we would truly like it to be.<br />\nToward remedying this situation, we are<br />\nhaving an open-house this Saturday at 2<br />\nPM. We urge everyone - fans and detractors<br />\n- to come on down, sip some brew, get<br />\ninvolved, and change the paper for the<br />\nbetter. We need photographers, ad people,<br />\ntypists (who, incidentally, get paid) and<br />\nlay-out personnel. And of course writers -any kind of writers:<br />\nnews, features,<br />\nentertainment, sports, and quizmakers. If<br />\nyou've ever thought to yourself, \"Hey, I<br />\ncan do a better job than those idiots ,\"<br />\nnow is your chance to prove it.<br /><br />\nDissent<br /><br />\nKill The Draft<br />\nBY PETER CINQUEGRANI<br /><br />\nThe young men of this<br />\ncountry and perhaps the young<br />\nwomen, too, face the prospect<br />\nof involuntary military service to<br />\ntheir country.<br />\nThe move to reinstitute<br />\nregistration for the selective<br />\nservice system comes as one of a<br />\nseries of moves designed to<br />\ndemonstrate America's will to<br />\nstand up to the Soviet Union.<br />\nCitizens' lives and happiness<br />\nshould not be pieces in their<br />\nown government's strategic chess<br />\ngame.<br />\nTo believe that it is possible<br />\nto have registration without the<br />\ndraft following is to believe that<br />\nyou can be almost pregnant. Yet<br />\nthe draft was one of the most<br />\ndisruptive forces in American<br />\nsociety. Any system which tries<br />\nto pick who will fight will have<br />\nbuilt-in inequalities. College deferments would result in a<br />\nworking-class Army defending<br />\nthe middle class at home. Yet, it<br />\nis important to continue producing educated minds and<br />\nprofessionals.<br />\nAny system which forces<br /><br />\nmen to do what they do not<br />\nwant to do is one of involuntary<br />\nservitude--slavery. To force<br />\nsomeone to fight when they<br />\ndo not want to is wrong. If<br />\nAmerica is worth defending, it<br />\nmust be worth defending because you wish to, not because<br />\nthe government forces you to.<br />\nPatriots cannot be drafted;<br />\nthey would already have joined.<br />\nIn peace time draftees are never<br />\nhappy or good soldiers. They do<br />\nnot have the esprit de corps<br />\nnecessary to form part of an<br />\neffective fighting force.<br />\nThere is a basic contradiction in the draft in America. In<br />\npeacetime, when soldiers do no<br />\nfighting, the public does not<br />\nsupport the draft and draftees<br />\nare unwilling to serve. However,<br />\nduring times of crisis, when<br />\nsoldiers are needed, the population is willing to support the<br />\ndraft and even upstages it by<br />\nenlisting. When the draft is most<br />\nneeded in crises, it is not necessary to bring the men in, while<br />\nin peacetime when soldiers are<br />\nnot fighting, the draft is not<br />\neffective.<br />\ncont. un p. 8<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editor<br />\nCouncil a Dud<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAgain, it seems the Student<br />\nCouncil is unable to hear the<br />\ncries of the commoners (their<br />\ncolleagues) way up in their white<br />\npalace in the clouds, I queryWhere is the JHU Student<br />\nCouncil?<br />\nI was highly disappointed,<br />\nalong with many other students,<br />\nthat the Intersession course list<br />\nwas so limited.

Secondly,<br />\nwhile I was the principal investigator on the NSF grant, Dr.<br />\nRobert Benbow helped me write<br />\nit and will co-direct the expenditure of funds. Since the article<br />\nsubmitted to the News-Letter by<br />\nMs. Rosen at least aeluded (SIC)<br />\nto Dr. Be nbow's contribution,<br />\nelimination of his name must<br />\nhave been either an editorial<br />\ndecision or a typesetting error.

Some of<br />\nthe poxy critics slag 'em off (they claim they've nicked<br />\nall their licks from the R &amp; B geezers), but sod the critics,<br />\nthey're all just naff tossers who know fuck all.

Whenever my dad got<br />\ndrunk, he'd come up to me and say, 'Look son, you<br />\nknow looks aren't everything' and shit like this.<br />\n\" It was huge. At that time, it was the reason I<br />\ndid everything. It's the reason I played the guitar--because of my nose.<br />\n\"What I wanted to do was distract attention<br />\nfrom my nose to my body and make people look at my<br />\nbody, instead of at my face--turn my body into a machine,\" he said.<br />\nLikewise, Townshend's patented onstage histrionics were initially used as a strategy to camouflage<br />\nother shortcomings of his--those as a guitarist.<br />\n\"I used to try and make up visually for what I<br />\ncouldn't play as a musician,\" he revealed. \"I'd hold my<br />\narm up in the air and bring it down so it looked really<br />\nlethal, even if it didn't sound too lethal.<br />\n\"I became a huge visual thing,\" he said. \"In<br />\nfact I forgot all about the guitar because my visual thing<br />\nwas more my music than the actual guitar. I got to jump<br />\nabout and the guitar became unimportant.\"<br />\nThe story of Peter's first guitar demolition has<br />\nbefore, but it bears repeating.<br />\ntold<br />\nbeen<br />\n\"It happened by, complete accident the first<br />\ntime,\" Townshend recalled. \"We were just kicking<br />\naround in a club which we played every Tuesday and I<br />\nwas playing the guitar and it hit the ceiling. It broke and<br />\nit kind of shocked me 'cause I wasn't ready for it to<br />\n,<br />\ngo.<br />\n'And I was expecting an incredible thing, it<br />\nbeing so precious to me, and I was expecting everybody<br />\nto go, Wow, he's broken his, guitar, he's broken his<br />\nguitar,' but nobody did anything, which made me kind<br />\nof angry in a way, and determined to get this precious<br />\nevent noticed by the audience. I proceeded to make a<br />\nbig thing of breaking the guitar. I pounded all over the<br />\nstage with it and I threw the bits on the stage and I<br />\npicked up my spare guitar and carried on as though I<br />\nreally meant to do it.\"<br />\nThe following week, the club was packed, and<br />\nthe ceremonial sacrifice of a six-stringed instrument<br />\nwould soon be an integral part of the Who concert<br />\nexperience.<br />\nWhen I was in the seventh grade, I wrote a letter<br />\nto Townshend, explaining to him how much the Who<br />\nmeant to me, and making a small request. Instead of<br />\nbusting up your guitar tonight, I reasoned, why not<br />\nsimply pretend you did and then mail it to me?<br />\nNow we all know how much individual guitars<br />\nmeant to Pete-virtually nothing. We also knows how<br />\nmuch be cares for the kids, the up-arid -coming rock<br /><br />\nand rollers. So it follows that the guitar arrived in the<br />\nmail shortly thereafter, right?<br />\nWrong. It still hasn't gotten here. Looking at the<br />\nsituation logically, then, either a.) Peter never received<br />\nthe letter, or b.) My mailman's son is, at this very<br />\nmoment, jamming away contentedly on a cherry red<br />\nGibson SG.<br />\nAnd I never have trusted that mailman.<br />\nYou were under the impression<br />\nThat when you were walking forward<br />\nYou'd end up further onward<br />\nBut things ain't quite that simple...<br />\n\"I've Had Enough\"<br /><br />\nPetWirer<br /><br />\nBaltimore Poseur In \\ i<br />\nResponsible<br />\n\\Held<br />\nConcert Deaths<br />\nRock<br />\nA2 The<br /><br />\nBaltiinOre<br /><br />\nA<br />\nalleged<br />\ntoda<br />\naddition, it is<br />\nthe<br />\nIn<br />\nfrom<br />\nKinney \\for t<br />\nannounced to- that footprints<br />\nques- suspect's size 121h. found Iwas<br />\n1<br />\nThe FBI<br />\nbeen<br />\nthey are<br />\n' new!<br />\nday that Maryland citizen loafers have<br />\nbacks of all<br />\nMon- embedded in the<br />\na<br />\ntioning<br />\nwith<br />\n\\<br />\nconnection<br />\n::e\"<br />\na<br />\nvictims.<br />\ntragedy at<br />\neleven<br />\nwriter. was '.1,11talk!<br />\nin<br />\nConsidine, a<br />\nnight's<br />\nCincinnati, '\u2018<br />\nI<br />\nam<br />\nday<br />\nall.\"Who<br />\nconcert in<br />\nwere \\<br />\nanybody's Cint<br />\nto deny<br />\n' rock Fleven persons<br />\nI quick<br />\nand<br />\non<br />\nOhio.<br />\nstep<br />\nincident.<br />\nto<br />\nasked.<br />\nas imp<br />\nkilled in the Considine, 23,\\ rights'!\" he<br />\nI'm<br />\n\"Believe me,<br />\nJohn D.<br />\nthis<br />\nbeing held<br />\nanybody by<br />\nTowson, is<br />\nadded. to TI<br />\ncrushed as<br />\nof<br />\nhe<br />\nbail.<br />\nthing,\"<br />\nGordon<br />\nconcerts<br />\nwithout spokesman<br />\nwhole<br />\n'<br />\nthe<br />\nat rocksooner ot<br />\nFBI<br />\nreports thatGreat- \"Violence<br />\nedvinc<br />\nabhorrent, and going to Ila<br />\nThomas<br />\nthe<br />\n\\<br />\nat<br />\nsomebody's<br />\nfoot Goi<br />\nsuspect arrived International is<br />\ntater,<br />\ntheir<br />\nCincinnati<br />\nMon- I<br />\nto put,<br />\nCI<br />\n5:45<br />\nas f<br />\n830 \\ have<br />\n/<br />\nAirport at<br />\ndown.\"<br />\ndepart at<br />\n1<br />\nonly toconcert, starring \\<br />\n-.4.3/<br />\nI day ,<br />\nThe<br />\nI<br />\n. p.m\u2022English rock group,<br />\n' the<br />\nbegan at<br />\n\u202245.1-7.-1111,0- -<br /><br />\ntive individual, Townshend has traditionally come to<br />\ngrips with his problems through religion. Hopefully, his<br />\nmaster, Meher Baba, will once again be able to provide<br />\nhim with answers.<br />\nIn 1977, when Townshend feared that rock and<br />\nroll was on the brink of death, he sunk into a deep<br />\ndepression, and it was only his relationship with Meher<br />\nBaba that pulled him through. Several months later, he<br />\npenned a detailed account of his struggles for Rolling<br />\nStone. Here is an excerpt:<br />\nMy crisis was caused by no one and<br />\nnothing. It cost me nothing,. it gives me<br />\neverything. It was never precipitated<br />\nbecause precipitation is a slow process.<br />\nThere was no waiting for time to take its<br />\ncourse, or for me to weigh up whether I<br />\nwas doing right or wrong. Rock &amp; roll<br />\nalways tries to do right. Rock &amp; roll<br />\nalways aims high and offers itself up as<br />\nthe tinderwood to the fire that will burn<br />\naway the crap in this world. Rock &amp; roll<br />\nuses up people, music and talent, even<br />\ngenius, like balsa in a roaring inferno...<br />\nThe right is that it tries, the wrong is that<br />\nit often fails.<br />\nIf it failed in Cincinnati, we surely can't place the<br />\nblame on the Who.<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\nAll joking aside, it's a shame that the tragedy in<br />\nCincinnati had to cast a shadow over the Who's entire<br />\nAmerican tour:One must sympathize not only with the<br />\nfamilies of the victims, but with the Who as well. For<br />\nafter all the Who have given to rock and roll, they<br />\ndeserve more out of it than this.<br />\n\"Initially, we felt stunned and empty,\" says lead<br />\nsinger Roger Daltrey. \"We felt we couldn't go on. But<br />\nyou gotta. There's no point in stopping.\"<br />\n\"I don't think we could have cancelled if we'd<br />\nwanted to,\" bassist John Entwistle maintains.\"We were<br />\ncontracted to play.\"<br />\nIt's difficult to say what kind of effect the<br />\ncatastrophe has had on Pete Townshend; most likely, he<br />\nfeels responsible to a certain degree. A deeply introspecListening to you I get the music<br />\nGazing at you I get the heat ...<br />\n\"We're Not Gonna Take It!\"<br />\nA strange buzz filtered through the Capitol<br />\nCentre, and it was charged with electricity. It was the<br />\nrealization that this would probably be the only concert<br />\nthis winter that would mean anything. It was the hope<br />\nthat the boys could bounce back from adversity and pull<br />\none more miracle out of the rock and roll fire.<br />\nIt was the return of the Who.<br />\nYeah, maybe you should have been home studying for that final exam, but since when does school take<br />\nprecedence over the Who? This was to be the Who's first<br />\nvisit since 1976, and there were questions to be answered:<br />\nAfter Cincinnati, would the group merely be<br />\ngoing through the motions?<br />\nWould Kenny Jones prove to be a suitable<br />\nreplacement for Keith Moon?<br />\nHow effectively would a horn section and a<br />\nkeyboardist mesh with the group?<br />\nWould the Who be looking back to the sixties, or<br />\nahead to the eighties?<br />\nClearly, many in the audience faced towards the<br />\nsixties. \"Man, I could really get into seeing Townshend<br />\nsmash his guitar,\" one glassy-eyed youth observed in the<br />\nmen's room before the show. One long toke off a PCP<br />\njoint later, he added,\"He smashed it in Cincinnati, you<br />\nknow. Like, it would really flip my head out to see him<br />\ndo it tonight.\"<br />\nActually, apart from a 1978 concert (Moon's last)<br />\nfilmed in London for \"The Kids Are Alright,\" Pete<br />\nTownshend hasn't obliterated a guitar in years. Still,<br />\nafter every show, it's inevitable that some people will go<br />\nhome disappointed because they haven't witnessed any<br /><br />\ndestruction.<br />\nAn albatross hangs from Townshend's neck, and<br />\nhow to remove the damn thing is anybody's guess.<br />\nNo, the Who didn't die before they got old-\"We're still working on it,\" laughs Townshend--but<br />\nfortunately, they realize it.<br />\n\"I'm 34 years old, my hair's getting thin, and l'm<br />\nnot gonna stand up on a stage like some 16-year-old kid<br />\n,and rock out all night and pretend that I can actually<br />\nhandle it,\" Pete said recently on the King Biscuit Flower<br />\nHour. \"I can only do so much.\"<br />\nThat goes for the recording studio as well.<br />\nThe last two Who albums have been, for the most<br />\npart, fairly mundane affairs.Save for the title track and a<br />\ncouple of Entwistle's numbers, Who Are You was<br />\napproximately as exciting as a date with Karen Ann<br />\nQuinlan.<br />\nBut the Who have always been known, first and<br />\nforemost, as a live act\u2014the definitive live act, many<br />\nsay\u2014and consequently their overall reputation hasn't<br />\nbeen tarnished.<br />\nFor the time being, it shall remain that way.<br />\nAt 8:45, the lights went down, a roar came up,<br />\nand there they were: The Who. With an exhilarating<br />\ncrunch of chords, they kicked into \"Substitute\" and<br />\n19,000 fans were on their feet.<br />\nFor the next two hours, Capitol Centre patrons<br />\nwere treated to the most glorious spectacle that contemporary rock music has to offer.<br />\nThere was Daltrey in the center, marching in<br />\nplace, slinging his microphone like a lariat and belting<br />\nout those lyrics ferociously.<br />\nTownshend patroled the right side of the stage,<br />\nleaping exuberently and sending out windmill chord.<br />\nsmashes by the dozen. If he was feeling down in the<br />\ndumps, he kept it well hidden.<br />\nJohn Entwisle was his usual staid self, looking as<br />\nif his feet were stuck in cement and executing lightningquick, dive-bomber bass runs.<br />\nBehind his drum kit, Kenny Jones was hardly<br />\nnoticeable, having skilfully adapted himself to the<br />\ngroup's repertoire. Only occasionally, such as in \"My<br />\nGeneration,\" was it apparent that an old friend was<br />\nmissing.<br />\nThe three-man brass section was used unobtrusively in \"Music Must Change\" (probably the weakest<br />\nnumber in the set) as well as in a few other tunes, ani.1 as<br />\none Who fan put it, \"They were great, precisely because<br />\nyou couldn't hear 'em.\"<br />\nNewest group member John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick<br />\nadded some tasty keyboard embellishments to the<br />\nproceedings, but generally stayed out of the spotlight as<br />\nwell.<br />\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the evening came<br />\nduring the first encore, \"Summertime Blues,\" when<br />\nTownshend lost his balance during one of his leaps and<br />\nlanded unceremoniously on his backside.<br />\nSomehow it's reassuring to discover that the Who<br />\nare almost as human as the rest of us.<br />\nFollowing an awe-inspiring rendition of the<br />\nclassic \"Won't Get Fooled Again,\" Townshend and Daltrey<br />\nembraced, and Pete surprised everyone by planting a kiss<br />\non the lead singer's cheek. After years of open warfare<br />\nbetween the two, it was a heart-warming sight.<br />\nIn the end, it was obvious that the Who can still<br />\ndeliver the goods. Though they've taken more than theii<br />\nshare of lumps, they've come back swinging.

Pp. 271. $10.95.<br />\nAvailable at the JHU Bookcenter.<br />\nFabian is Jerzy Kozinski's character study of a man with wanderlust in<br />\nmodern society. Passion Play is the series<br />\nof events in Fabian's ride through the<br />\npolo fields of life.<br />\nA skilled polo player,jumper, and<br />\nauthor, Fabian travels alone in his van<br />\naround the United States in search of<br />\nteaching positions and one-on-one polo<br />\nmatches. His humanitarian equestrian<br />\nideas, which will make him a hero for<br />\nanimal lovers, are vividly described in<br />\ntypical Kosinski fashion:<br />\nAs the rider spurred his mount to<br />\npush off its foreleg crashed on the turf,<br />\nshattering the bone just below the knee.<br />\nThe pony, foaming in its frenzy, kept at<br />\nthe gallop, its splintered leg buckling, a<br />\nbare bone protruding at every footfall,<br />\nuntil, staggering, the animal pitched and<br />\nstumbled. Only then did the rider, as<br />\nfrenzied and possessed as his mount,<br />\nbecome aware of what had taken place.<br />\nTraveling in his van, Fabian is able<br />\nto gain the transient. freedom once<br />\npossessed by the cowboy or the explorer.<br />\nMuch like the character of Goldmund in<br /><br />\nNarcissus and Goldmund by Hesse,<br />\nFabian values his freedom above all else,<br />\nrejecting the security of marriage or a<br />\nsteady job. Kosinski uses Fabian to show<br />\nthat a free wanderer can survive in<br />\nAmerica today. Mistrusting medicine and<br />\ntechnology, and loving the woodland,<br />\nFabian is the Don Quixote of this disappearing lifestyle. Kosinski makes this<br />\nparallel in Fabian's countless horseback<br />\nriding scenes. In one case, Kosinski<br />\ndescribes Fabian riding \"as if charging<br />\nwith a lance, in combat with an enemy<br />\nonly he can see.\"<br />\nAs a transient, Fabian suffers<br />\nfrom the problems typical of wanderers,<br />\nthe most prevalent being the need for<br />\nsexual fulfillment. Fabian's sexual frustration is well represented by Kosinski's<br />\ndescription of a booth in Latin America<br />\nwhere a girl behind a glass wall strips<br />\nfarther and farther as more quarters are<br />\nadded. When Fabian does find a partner,<br />\nhe is as free as in the bed as he is in life.<br />\nHis sexual encounters range from sadomasochism and bestiality with his horses<br />\nto a love trio with a girl and partial<br />\ntranssexual.<br />\nAnother problem Fabian faces is<br />\nthe onset of old age.

Some<br />\nalso examine the role of the media,<br />\nespecially television, in depersonalizing<br />\nrelationships and anihilating individuality-- in Apocalypse Now, the titillating<br />\nPlayboy bunny show that dangles a<br />\nchoice bit of pre-packaged American<br />\nfemininity in front of the sex-starved<br />\nsoldiers and then yanks it away, and in<br />\nDown and Dirty, the senile grandmother<br />\nwho stares at a T.V. set all day parroting<br />\nEnglish words.<br />\nThe Electric Horseman, the<br />\ncurrent Redford-Fonda vehicle, also<br />\nmakes use of this theme. Redford plays<br />\nSonny Steele, a \"five-time-all-around<br />\ncowboy,\" who has traded the bruises and<br />\nbroken bones of the rodeo for the safe,<br />\nrich and comfortable existence as a cereal<br />\npromoter. Though the film shows little of<br />\nSteele's cowboy life, we see the transition<br />\nfrom real to \"electric\" cowboy in a series<br />\nof still frames and episodic sequences: an<br />\nadvertising artist pencilling a moustache<br />\non a photo of Steele's clean-shaven face,<br />\nSteele sporting the moustache and<br />\ngrinning for publicity shots, Steele<br />\npitching cereal.

Steele finds a<br />\ncause-- an ex-race horse bought by the<br />\nsame corporation that bought him, shot<br />\nup with drugs and steroids, and reduced<br />\nto a symbol-- and becomes the man he<br />\nused to be. Nally Martin (Jane Fonda)<br />\nundergoes a similar transformation. A<br />\nslick T.V. reporter, Martin tracks down<br />\nSteele to get her story but quickly<br />\nbecomes his friend and lover as she helps<br />\nhim lead the horse to an isolated canyon<br />\nwhere he sets the horse free.

He plays Steele with honesty,<br />\nsincerity, modesty, and a sense of humor.<br />\nDespite all his drunken bouts and<br />\noverexposure to the media, Redford's<br />\nSteele remains kind and good. Fonda,<br />\nwho can play both cowgirls (Comes a<br />\nHorseman) and big city journalists, is<br />\nconvincing here. Her Hally Martin is<br />\nrarely a caricature, and the little girl<br />\ninside her is sweet and touching.<br />\nThe Electric Horseman is a<br />\nthoroughly American movie.

TAYLOR<br />\nMiss Teenage Arkansas, Hieronymous Bosch, Jesus, and a lesbian motorcycle gang all appear in the slim booklet<br />\ncalled Ampersand that is making its debut<br />\nthis week at Homewood. Ampersand is a<br />\ncollection of ten poems and twelve pieces<br />\nof fiction put together by freshmen<br />\nLisa Ginsburg, Doug MilleroNancy Ring,<br />\nand Cay Whitley.<br />\nRing wanted to create a magazine<br />\nwith no cover charge that would function<br />\nas a forum for student creative expression. She felt the campus needed a<br />\npublication that was simple to produce<br />\nand quick to reach its audience. Though<br />\nRing has had little experience in publishing, she was able to put out 250 issues of<br />\nAmpersand in about a month at a cost of<br />\n$133.<br />\nAt first glimpse Ampersand presents itself as a sort of mystery. Each<br />\npiece is credited, but with neither an<br />\neditor's note nor a table of contents the<br />\nmagazine might have sprung into existence by spontaneous generation. According to Ring, the contents were not<br />\nlisted because so much of the work was<br />\nuntitled. Ring explained that she left the<br />\nmagazine without an introduction or<br />\ncomment because she din't want to give<br />\nreaders any preconcieved ideas. \"I want<br />\npeople to take it as it is,\" she said.<br />\nRing is very happy with the final<br />\nproduct though she describes it as being<br />\n\"in its infancy.\" A diverse array of<br />\nwriters appear in the issue. Most of the<br />\ncontributors are freshmen, but several<br />\nupperclassmen and a graduate student are<br />\nalso represented. Only about half the<br />\nwriters are actually writing majors. The<br /><br />\ncontents are equally varied. The poems<br />\nrange in structure from sonnets to free<br />\nverse. Several pieces of fiction are directly<br />\nwritten short stories like Doug Miller's<br />\nMiss Teenage Arkansas. Others such as<br />\nCay Whitley's fiction verge on prose<br />\npoetry.<br />\nThe work in Ampersand is generally interesting and well-written. Of<br />\nspecial note are the poems, Bosch in<br />\nParadise by Mandy Levine and Rough *z<br />\nSketch by Nancy Ring. Both are sensitively written and at times impulsive.
