This would, of course, solve the parking problem but it would make double dating impossible\u2014unless, that<br />\nis, the boys make the girls run along behind the car. But that<br />\nis no solution either because by the time they get to the prom<br />\nthe girls will be panting so hard that they will wilt their corsages.<br />\nAnother suggested cure for our parking woes is that all<br />\nstudents smoke Marlboro cigarettes. At first glance this seems<br />\nan excellent solution because we all know Marlboro is the<br />\ncigarette which proved that flavor did not go out when filters<br />\ncame in\u2014and when we sit around and smoke good Marlboros<br />\nwe are so possessed by sweet contentment that none of us<br />\nwishes ever to, leave, which means no gadding about which<br />\nmeans no driving, which means no parking problem.<br />\nBut the argument in favor of Marlboros overlooks one important fact: when you run out of Marlboros you must go get<br />\nsome more, which means driving, which means parking, which<br />\nmeans you're right back where you started.<br />\nProbably the most practical suggestion to alleviate the campus<br />\nin<br />\nparking situation is to tear down every school of dentistry<br />\nsay<br />\nto<br />\nnot<br />\nis<br />\nThis<br />\nlot.<br />\nthe country and turn it into a parking<br />\nthat dentistry is unimportant. Gracious, no Dentistry is important and vital and a shining part of our American heritage.<br />\nBut the fact is there is no real need for separate schools of dentistry. Dentistry could easily be moved to the school of mining<br />\nengineering.

This would, of course, solve the parking problem but it would make double dating impossible\u2014unless, that<br />\nis, the boys make the girls run along behind the car. But that<br />\nis no solution either because by the time they get to the prom<br />\nthe girls will be panting so hard that they will wilt their corsages.<br />\nAnother suggested cure for our parking woes is that all<br />\nstudents smoke Marlboro cigarettes. At first glance this seems<br />\nan excellent solution because we all know Marlboro is the<br />\ncigarette which proved that flavor did not go out when filters<br />\ncame in\u2014and when we sit around and smoke good Marlboros<br />\nwe are so possessed by sweet contentment that none of us<br />\nwishes ever to, leave, which means no gadding about which<br />\nmeans no driving, which means no parking problem.<br />\nBut the argument in favor of Marlboros overlooks one important fact: when you run out of Marlboros you must go get<br />\nsome more, which means driving, which means parking, which<br />\nmeans you're right back where you started.<br />\nProbably the most practical suggestion to alleviate the campus<br />\nin<br />\nparking situation is to tear down every school of dentistry<br />\nsay<br />\nto<br />\nnot<br />\nis<br />\nThis<br />\nlot.<br />\nthe country and turn it into a parking<br />\nthat dentistry is unimportant.
