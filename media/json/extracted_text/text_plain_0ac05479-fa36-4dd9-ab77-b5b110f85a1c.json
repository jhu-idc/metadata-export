The Iranian Students<br />\nAssociation (ISA) holds that the Shah has<br />\ndonated money to the Med School, and<br />\nthat the degree was granted in response to<br />\n(and in hopes of future) grants. Dr. Harry<br />\nWoolf, Provost of the University, has said,<br />\n\"We don't get any money from the<br />\nIranian government, only the fees<br />\ncovering faculty expenses at the College.\"<br />\nThe jump from the exchange program<br />\nrelationship to the degree award to<br />\nAshraf reveals a very murky process.<br />\nWoolf heads the Honorary Degree<br />\nCommittee, which is composed of seven<br />\nmembers from all divisions of the<br />\nUniversity. Dr. Richard Macksey stressed<br />\nthat the Committee is more concerned<br />\nWith the Commencement awards in May,<br />\nWhile the President customarily<br />\nnominates . the Commemoration<br />\nspeaker(s). The Committee last met<br />\nOctober 28 to review a memo sent by<br />\nWoolf listing the candidates for February<br />\nand May. \"We're not concerned on a<br />\ndiscussion basis with Commemoration<br />\nDay,\" said Macksey, \"if the Committee<br />\nexists, the Committee ratifies.\" The three<br />\nrecipients of Commemoration degrees<br />\nwere proposed by President Muller; they<br />\nwere perfunctorily . approved by the<br />\ncommittee, with no questions asked or<br />\nProtests received. No vitae, however, was<br />\nsupplied about the candidates.\"We know<br />\nthere's controversy,\" said Woolf, \"but<br />\ndon't know the facts of the charges. It<br />\nlooked pretty clean to me at the time.\"<br />\nMike Hoffheimer, a Hopkins junior and<br />\none of five persons arrested Sunday,<br />\nreplied that \"if he feels that way, it's<br />\nembarassing for an institution to not<br />\nknow what's going on in the world. How<br />\ncould it look clean, with people from<br />\nHopkins over there, seeing what's going<br />\non.\"<br />\nWoolf termed Ashraf s nomination<br />\nsymbolic\", citing her role in helping and<br />\nguiding the development of the College of<br />\nHealth Sciences. In the terms of an ISA<br />\nmember, the Princess, \"after the Shah, is<br />\nthe most hated person by all people in<br />\n<br />\nIran.\" Ashraf s reputation is notorious, to<br />\nsay. the least. \"Of all women in the<br />\nworld,\" stated ne faculty member,\"why<br />\nwas she singled out, a woman with that<br />\nkind of reputation, from that kind of<br />\ngovernment?\"<br />\nThe Washington Post, February 23,<br />\n1976, reported that \"one of the Shah's<br />\nclosest relatives who continues to be<br />\nsurrounded by widespread suspicion is his<br />\ntwin sister, Princess Ashraf, a world<br />\nleader in woman's rights movements. The<br />\nPrincess, whose three marriages and<br />\njet-set living style have offended many<br />\nIranians, is said to be deeply involved in a<br />\nnumber of 'shady deals'. 'Take the<br />\ntrucking industry: said a wealthy Tehran<br />\nbusinessman, 'not a truck can move<br />\nanywhere without a payoff going to<br />\nAshraf.' In the days before Iran was<br />\nswimming in oil wealth, it was widely<br />\nbelieved that Princess Ashraf profited<br />\nfrom illegal opium deals involving Iran's<br />\nlarge poppy production.\"<br />\nThis latter charge is documented by<br />\nMichael Parrish, an Indiana University<br />\nfaculty member, in the December 1962<br />\nissue of The Minority of One.\"Two years<br />\nago,\" he writes, \"the Swiss police arrested<br />\nthe Shah's sister, Princess Ashraf, for<br />\nhaving several suitcases full of heroin.\"<br />\nShe was on her way to the U.S. at the<br />\ntime. Hoffheimer added that \"she has<br />\nbeen arrested for drug-running at least<br />\nthree times in European airports,\" and<br />\nthat her diplomatic immunity had been<br />\nused to successfully carry out the<br />\noperations. Her personal trafficking may<br />\nhave been discontinued with the wealth<br />\nbrought by Iranian oil (thus freeing her to<br />\nbe a \"humanitarian\"), but Iran remains<br />\nthe country with the most addicts per<br />\npopulation (an estimated half million by<br />\nthe New York Times), and the Shah in<br />\n1969 removed a ban which prohibited the<br />\ncultivation of opium.<br />\nThe political corruption of the royal<br />\nfamily was described by Nation, April 12,<br />\n1965. It seems that the donation of<br />\nmillions of U.S. foreign aid dollars to Iran<br />\nwas quickly followed by the deposit of<br />\nmillions in a numbered Swiss bank<br />\naccount to the \"Pahlavi Foundation\".<br />\nPhotostat copies of the account revealed<br />\na $3 million check withdrawn to Ashraf,<br />\nan amount exceeded only by $15 million<br />\ngiven to the Shah's wife. Eleven years<br />\nlater the Post is still reporting on the<br />\n\"suspected\" corruption of the Shah and<br />\nhis relatives.<br />\nThe Post, though, falters in describing<br />\nAshraf \"a world leader in woman's rights<br />\n<br />\nmovements.\" \"Perhaps she is representing<br />\nthe rights of the woman of her type or<br />\nclass,\" said the ISA member. \"The<br />\nwomen of Iran, the workers and patriots,<br />\nare worse off than ever. The workers<br />\nmake fifty cents a day; women prisoners<br />\nare tortured and raped in front of their<br />\nhusbands and brothers.\"<br />\nThe political repression of the Shah's<br />\nregime is unquestioned. Martin Ennals,<br />\nSecretary of Amnesty International, has<br />\nstated that \"no country in the world has<br />\na worse record in human rights than<br />\nIran.\" There are an estimated 100,000<br />\npolitical prisoners (4000 women), the<br />\nmajority of whom are tortured; at least<br />\nfour hundred have been executed in the<br />\npast four years. Secret military tribunals<br />\ndecide the fate of prisoners, with<br />\ntorture-induced confessions common.<br />\nRepeated attempts by international<br />\norganizations to send observ,l<br />\nhave been<br />\nmet with forced deportations.<br />\n\"No one can claim to be naive about<br />\nthat (the political repression),\" said the<br />\nprofessor. Woolf, though, declared that<br />\n\"it's not our role to judge\" and said the<br />\ncontroversy was dismissed at the time of<br />\nselection. \"We try to have candidates<br />\nwith a bearing on the University, some<br />\nkind of proper affiliation,\" he explained.<br />\n\"The Princess was awarded as a patron of<br />\nthe University program in Iran.\" Again,<br />\nthe faculty member questioned, \"why<br />\nher, why not a doctor, or someone in the<br />\n<br />\nThe Princess Ashraf<br />\n<br />\nhealth program?\" Ashrafs position with<br />\nthe College of Health Sciences, as the<br />\n\"political and monetary backbone\"(from<br />\na Hopkins doctor involved in the<br />\nprogram), is not the result of any special<br />\nmerit; she was appointed by the Shah.,<br />\n\"When Hopkins does something like<br />\nthat,\" the ISA member said, \"it<br />\nlegitimates Iran and its reactionary<br />\nregime.\"<br />\nThe process of the degree award was<br />\nnot handled like a ceremonious event.<br />\nThe Honorary Degree Committee,<br />\nnaturally, knew of the nomination, but<br />\nboth Macksey and Dr. Owen Phillips had<br />\ntrouble recalling the minimal approval<br />\nprocedure, and 'Macksey only<br />\nremembered Ashraf when reading over<br />\nthe convocation procedure Sunday<br />\nmorning. Outside of the marshals, no<br />\nfaculty members were told of the<br />\nconferral; \"nobody had the chance to<br />\nprotest,\" said the professor. When one of<br />\nthe persons invited to be a marshal<br />\nwithdrew upon seeing the selection of the<br />\nPrincess, the University quietly ignored<br />\nhis action. Most people first found out<br />\nabout Ashraf's award at the<br />\nCommemoration Sunday.<br />\nOne group that knew well in advance,<br />\nhowever, was SAVAK, Iranian secret<br />\npolice. In cooperation with Hopkins<br />\nsecurity, federal agents (one in a Hopkins<br />\nsecurity uniform), and the Baltimore City<br />\nPolice, agents in plain clothes were at the<br />\nLyric Theater under the cover of<br />\n\"newspaper reporters\". When the<br />\ndemonstration inside the theater began,<br />\nthe SAVAK agents physically carried<br />\npeople out of the auditorium,<br />\nundertaking all the police duties up to the<br />\nactual arrest. SAVAK had meetings and<br />\nradio contact with the police; in short,<br />\nthey were condoned by the University.<br />\nBodyguards for foreign visitors is normal<br />\nprocedure, but in this case, the emphasis<br />\nwas on hiding any connection with the<br />\nIranian government.<br />\nAs for the arrest, Hoffheimer and the<br />\nfour others had to wait six hours in jail<br />\nbefore they were told of the charges<br />\nagainst them (disorderly conduct). While<br />\nthey were in the basement of the Lyric,<br />\nthe police were heard negotiating who<br />\nwas to be the arresting officer.<br />\nHoffheimer asked who the officer was;<br />\nthe reply, \"I'll tell you later.\" During the<br />\nbooking, the police were on radio talking<br />\nto Hopkins security about the charges.<br />\nApparently, the six hour delay was due to<br />\nthe time taken by the administration to<br />\ndecide on the charges. Another gloss on<br />\nthe arrest is the fact that Hopkins<br />\nsecurity guards were brought into the jail<br />\nto identify the protesters for sure<br />\nidentification at the trial later.<br />\nWith the award of the degree to Ashraf<br />\nand the arrest of the demonstrators past<br />\nhistory, the University now has to justify<br />\nits actions. The protesters did upset the<br />\nceremony, with Woolf remarking that<br />\n\"it's not a road to justice,\" and that it<br />\nwas \"a disruption of Hopkins' private<br />\ncelebration.\" Hoffheimer counters, of<br />\ncourse, that \"Ashraf is breaking into<br />\nIranian lives every day. An honorary<br />\ndegree is not a private thing; Ashraf is not<br />\njust an ordinary person.\" The<br />\npresentation of the doctorate, with the<br />\n\"short-circuit\" of the Degree Committee,<br />\nthe secrecy surrounding information<br />\nabout the award, and the Princess' and<br />\nIran's backgrounds, calls for something<br />\nbeyond the citation words of last Sunday.<br />\n<br />\n\fCAMPUS NOTES<br />\n<br />\npage 2/news-letter/february 27, 1976<br />\n<br />\nservices<br />\nThe M.

Those<br />\ndisenchanted with the .policies<br />\nand practices of the United<br />\nStates over the last several<br />\ndecades still enjoy a remarkable<br />\ndegree of liberty. SB-1 is an<br />\nassualt on this liberty. It is<br />\nfrightening that SB-1 should be<br />\nthe object of serious<br />\nconsideration. But such are the<br />\ntimes that it could achieve not<br />\njust consideration, but passage.<br />\n<br />\nMorris Udall<br />\nDoes (lie Union Leader's<br />\nendorsement now mean the kiss<br />\nof death?

He got 24% of the first<br />\nchoice votes but what hasn:t<br />\nbeen emphasized is that he has<br />\nthe support of over 40% of the<br />\nDemocratit electorate. Those<br />\nwho voted for Bayh, Harris, and<br />\nShriver\u2014Ud all is the second<br />\nchoice of every one of them<br />\naccording to my private polls.<br />\nCarter with his 30% conservative<br />\nsupport is outgunned by the<br />\npotential Udall liberal<br />\nconstituency.

CONSIDINE<br />\nAbout a year ago, I happened<br />\nto be in the Towson State<br />\nCollege Student Center, and in<br />\nthe course of my wanderings, I<br />\nnoticed music pervading the<br />\ngeneral hotel-lobby atmosphere<br />\nof the building. Muzak, I figured<br />\n(although it was far more hip<br />\nthan the general WLIF fare);<br />\nuntil a voice was discerned<br />\nmumbling some explanation of<br />\nwhat was played.<br />\nThis was WVTS, Towson's<br />\ncarrier current station. Like most<br />\ncarrier current stations, it had a<br />\nlimited following, intermittant<br />\nbroadcast hours, and very little<br />\npotential. Unbeknownst to the<br />\ngeneral public, though, help was<br />\non the way: FM.<br />\nRight now, Towson is in its<br />\nthird week of FM programming,<br />\nwith WCVT-FM a broadcast<br />\nreality at 89. What may seem to<br />\nbe an overnight transition,<br />\nhowever, was anything but<br />\nsudden; the metamorphosis of<br />\nCarrier Current to FM took over<br />\nthree years.<br />\nWhat does it take to go FM?<br />\n\"A lot of work,\" to quote station<br />\nmanager Steve Curran. Outside of<br />\nthe basic procedure of obtaining<br />\npermission, a frequency, and a<br />\nlicense there are the problems<br />\ninvolved in equipment.<br />\nFirst of all, money. The cost<br />\nfor Towson's FM station has<br />\nbeen almost entirely for<br />\nequipment, and has totalled<br />\napproximately $36,000. With the<br />\nexception of the tower<br />\nconstruction ( due to county<br />\nlaws), all equipment installation<br />\nhas been done by _student<br />\nvolunteers.<br />\nBut there were also problems<br />\nwith personnel, and fulfilling the<br />\nF.C.C. guidelines for an<br />\nEducational FM station.<br />\nFor starters, the station is<br />\nalmost entirely student staffed<br />\nand managed. This creates a<br />\nstrong core of support for the<br />\nstation, but it also has<br />\ndrawbacks. When exams and<br />\nvacations occur, it will not be<br />\neasy to get all the DJ's to their<br />\nshows, let alone on time.<br />\n\"Mid-terms are coming up,\" says<br />\nCurran, \"and this should be an<br />\nindication of how things will go.\"<br />\nAlthough he expects to weather<br />\nthe exams, the end of the term<br />\nposes yet another problem. Even<br />\nwith 90% of the staff living in the<br />\narea as full-time residents, Curran<br />\nexpects scheduling problems.<br />\nAs an educational station, they<br />\nare obligated to serve the<br />\ncommunity, which right now is<br />\nnot easy. \"Since we went on in<br />\nMid-term, we really couldn't start<br />\nany educational courses-by-radio,<br />\n\"Curran stated.<br />\nFor now, they have two<br />\nstudent created and produced<br />\neducational programs, Media<br />\nMakers and Business Beat,<br />\nbroadcast from 9:00-9:30<br />\nweekdays. The rest of the<br />\nprogramming is based on<br />\nClassical music from 6:00-9:00<br />\na.m., and Jazz from 8:00 to<br />\nmidnight. The rest of the<br />\nbroadcast day is 'progressive<br />\nradio'.\"<br />\nDoesn't all that progressive<br />\nsound like typical carrier-current<br />\nradio? \"Yeah, and I'm not too<br />\n<br />\npleased, but at the moment,<br />\nthere's not a whole lot I can do,\"<br />\nsaid Curran. \"We're a new<br />\nstation, and we've still got a lot<br />\nof growing to do.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the chances<br />\nfor an FM station at Hopkins,<br />\nCurran gave this evaluation:<br />\n\"I really can't see Hopkins<br />\nwith an FM station for at least<br />\nfive years. There's a lot of<br />\npreliminary action that has to be<br />\ntaken, and one thing that is<br />\nessential is an experienced<br />\nAdvisor, with radio background<br />\nand an F.C.C. first class license.<br />\n<br />\nIt just makes everything so much<br />\neasier; he would know how to fill<br />\nout the forms, how to deal with<br />\nthe government officials.<br />\n\"As for a Mass Comm<br />\nprogram, you don't need to be a<br />\nMass Comm major to be in radio.<br />\nYou could just as easily be an Art<br />\nStudent.<br />\n\"It's fastest if you can get all<br />\nvolunteers. Of course it will take<br />\ntime; you've got to expect it to<br />\nchange hands. But we had full<br />\nsupport of our Student<br />\nGovernment, and it's taken a<br />\nlong time, but we're here.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe return of the<br />\nThin White Duke<br />\nStation to Station, David<br />\nBowie's latest lp, is already<br />\nbeginning to generate a<br />\nsnowballing excitement with<br />\nmultiple hits flying out of radios<br />\ninto the waiting ears of his<br />\nbeloved young Americans. The<br />\n\"Thin White Duke\" is staging<br />\nmore than a return; the boy with<br />\nthe animal grace has carefully<br />\nmapped out a Bowie year; after<br />\nthe whirlwind coast-to-coast<br />\ntour, a movie will be released for<br />\nall of us to gawk and coo at, and<br />\nfrom there Bowie's momentum<br />\nand ability to mesmerize his<br />\naudience could carry him<br />\nanywhere\u2014perhaps to his own<br />\nrecently disclosed fancy of ruling<br />\nthe world.<br />\nThough Bowie has more fans<br />\nthan ever, long-standing<br />\naficionados of the man can only<br />\nfeel some disappointment at the<br />\ngeneral musical mediocrity of<br />\nStation to Station. It is a<br />\nreflection of Bowie's lastest<br />\nremarks in Rolling Stone<br />\nmagazine where he denounced<br />\nrock 'n roll. as \"musical soma,\"<br />\nvery close to \"becoming an<br />\nimmobile, sterile fascist that<br />\nconstantly spews its propaganda<br />\non every arm of the media.\" But<br />\nthe writing on the new album<br />\nremains intensely personal, joyful<br />\nand optimistic, having its roots in<br />\nThinky Dory and earlier works.<br />\nThe new devotees applaud the<br />\nabsense of glitter and feminine<br />\n<br />\ngarb, but it should be<br />\nremembered that the<br />\nandrogynous darling has always<br />\nremained a few steps ahead of<br />\nthe pack and now points to a<br />\nmellowing in these golden years.<br />\nThere can be no doubt that<br />\nDavid Bowie is about to make his<br />\nbid for messiah, a role he's<br />\ngroomed himself for these last<br />\nseven years. What is scary is that<br />\nBowie's remarks on the potential<br />\ndangers of popular music seem to<br />\nbe exactly what he is<br />\ntrying\u2014except that I think he has<br />\nsome important things to say.<br />\nalways has. He is about to launch<br />\na cinema career and start his own<br />\nproduction \u2022 company. To be sure.<br />\nthe future theatrics of David<br />\nBowie will be more interesting<br />\nthan national political struggles<br />\nto the average American. Let's<br />\nhope -somebody , maybe even<br />\nBowie himself, has enough<br />\ncommon sense to keep things uI<br />\nperspective.<br />\nBut remember, we are dealing<br />\nwith the one and only ZiggY<br />\nStardust. Bowie has put down his<br />\npast roles, but Ziggy was an<br />\namazing piece of autobiography,<br />\nand has so far proven to be the<br />\ntrue David Bowie story.'<br />\nWe are about to witness not<br />\nonly Bowie's rock 'n roll suicide,<br />\nbut most likely ours as well.<br />\nDavid Bowie will be appearing<br />\nat the Capitol Center on March<br />\n13 and 14.<br />\ndint,<br />\n<br />\n\ffebruary 27,1976/news-letter/page 5<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 Can<br />\n<br />\n'76 flicks<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nA playboy enterprises film<br />\n7:30 and 11:00 PM<br />\n<br />\nIT IS A JOY!<br />\n<br />\nAn onehaning ma:union Ws Oho joy.'living.

Without further<br />\nmoralizing, I urge the University<br />\nto drop these outrageous charges.<br />\nMarie Nally<br />\n<br />\nwomen led<br />\nher to mobilize the educated and<br />\naffluent women of her country.<br />\nThe organization which resulted<br />\nfrom this activity has evolved<br />\ninto a model center for service to<br />\nwomen. Pricess Ashraf holds as a<br />\nbasic truth the proposition that<br />\nonly when women achieve their<br />\nfull potential in human society<br />\nwill men achieve theirs.<br />\nWhen Her Imperial Highness<br />\nwas appointed to the United<br />\nNations as chief of the Iranian<br />\ndelegation, she exploited this<br />\ninternational forum to continue<br />\nher dedication to humanitarian<br />\ncuases. In 1968, she became the<br />\nfirst woman to preside over a<br />\nmajor international<br />\nproceeding\u2014the International<br />\nConference on Human Rights. In<br />\n1975, she was instrumental in the<br />\norganization of the International<br />\nWomen's Year Program and was a<br />\nmajor author of the World Plan<br />\nof Action approved in Mexico<br />\nCity by delegates from 130<br />\nnations calling for the<br />\nachievement of full and equal<br />\nrights for women throughout the<br />\nworld in the course of the next<br />\n<br />\ndecade.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhas a special interest in the honor<br />\nwe bestow today upon Princess<br />\nAshraf. Medical care, particularly<br />\nfor those outside major<br />\npopulation centers, is one of her<br />\ncountry's most critical problems.<br />\nOver the years, many Iranian<br />\nphysicians have received their<br />\ntraining at Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nbecause of that earlier experience<br />\nan academic exchange program<br />\nhas been established between this<br />\nUniversity and the College of<br />\nHealth Sciences at the Reza<br />\nPahlavi Medical Center in Tehran.<br />\nThe goal is to develop a broad<br />\nspectrum of health professionals<br />\nto meet the specific needs of<br />\nIran, where over half the<br />\npopulation still resides in small<br />\nvillages.<br />\n<br />\nThis program has by no means<br />\nbeen an unidirectional learning<br />\nexperience. Physicians in this<br />\ncountry, too, are clustered<br />\naround population centers, and<br />\nthe solutions found in Iran to the<br />\nproblem of maldistiibution<br />\nmedical care may have a<br />\nsignificant impact upon the<br />\ndelivery of medical care in the<br />\nUnited States. The success of this<br />\nentire effort is no small measure<br />\nof a reflection of the foresight of<br />\nPrincess Ashraf, who earlY<br />\nrecognized the needs of her<br />\npeople and helped bring together<br />\nher country's resources to meet<br />\nthose needs.<br />\nMr. President, it is a distinct<br />\npleasure to present for the degree<br />\nof Doctor of Laws, Her Imperial<br />\nHighness, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi<br />\nof Iran.<br />\n<br />\nwore voices_<br />\nDr. Owen Phillips, Honorary Degree Committee, about the Princess'<br />\nselection:<br />\n\"I wouldn't like to say it didn't happen, but it didn't impress itself<br />\nupon me very 'flitch.\"<br />\nISA member:<br />\n\"Considering the nature of A shraf: the political prisoners, the living<br />\nconditions (in Iran), and the women's position, workers and patriots.<br />\nHopkins' corroboration with the Shah is revealed. . . as support ofone<br />\nofthe most reactionary regimes in the world.''<br />\nDr. Richard Macksey, Honorary Degree Committee:<br />\n\"We tend not to think in political terms. . . it's traditionally the<br />\npurview of the President to make nominations (for the<br />\nCommemoration).<br />\nDr. Harry Woolf, Provost, head of Honorary Degree Committee;about<br />\nhis presentation:<br />\n\"That's what I presented to the community, that's vhat I believe to be<br />\ntrue.

I<br />\nmean,to the men and women in<br />\nShriver and Garland Halls, all<br />\nUniversity ceremonies are major,<br />\nand so the publicist inevitably<br />\ntrumps the affair up for more<br />\nthan it actually is. Usually,<br />\nCommemoration Day<br />\ncelebrations are dull to begin<br />\nwith, and as they proceed,<br />\nbecome duller yet. It's true that<br />\nthe procession is quite a<br />\nspectacle, and even inspiring for a<br />\nfew crazy moments, but its<br />\nnovelty is gone once the speeches<br />\nbegin. Therefore, when we read<br />\nthat this event was major, well,<br />\nthat didn't say a hell of a lot.<br />\nBut wehad no idea. Who knew<br />\nthat Hopkins was tossing an<br />\nhonorary degree to a woman who<br />\nis not only tied to the tyrannical<br />\nIranian government, but alleged<br />\nto have overseen vast drug<br />\nsmuggling units as well? Who<br />\nwould have guessed that the<br />\nCentennial Convocation would<br />\nbe the leading story on the<br />\nSunday night late news? And<br />\nwho could have predicted that<br />\nSteven Muller would emerge<br />\nfrom the Centennial finale with a<br />\nstain on his administration<br />\ninstead of the crown everyone<br />\nhad expected.<br />\nAs friends of the Universio<br />\narrived at the Lyric Theatre,<br />\nscattered groups were<br />\ndistributing leaflets outside, but<br />\nin numbers no greater than those<br />\nusually brought out by a<br />\ngathering of this size. An obvious<br />\nthought was that maybe the<br />\nLabor Party would continue their<br />\nharassment of Muller inside, but<br />\nthen, Shriver Hall, scene of past<br />\ninterruptions, was not quite the<br />\nLyric.<br />\nThe ceremony began<br />\nsmoothly. The Baltimore<br />\nSymphony set a dignified tone,<br />\nJohn Barth played announcer<br />\nwhen the procession started, and<br />\nall the Hopkins heavyweights<br />\nfound their places on stage. Had<br />\nnothing else happened that day,<br />\nthe chief irony would have been<br />\nthe presence of Lincoln Gordon,<br />\nwho was seated next to Muller<br />\nwhile Robert D. H. Harvey<br />\npraised the current president for<br />\nhis restoration of Hopkin's<br />\nfinances. As it turns out, that<br />\nlittle twist will rate as mere trivia<br />\nwhen this Commemoration Day<br />\nis remembered.<br />\nProvost Harry Woolf was<br />\nspeaking when the first cry of<br />\n\"disgrace, Ashraf is a criminal\"<br />\n<br />\nLyric was a wild mess. Hopkins<br />\nand Iranian security men gagged<br />\nand tackled the intruders, trying<br />\nto hide them from the audience's<br />\nsight. Some of the distinguished<br />\nguests clapped ferociously, in an<br />\nattempt to muffle the cries of<br />\n\"disgrace!\" In a few minutes, the<br />\ndemonstrators were gone, hustled<br />\ndown to Central District to be<br />\nbooked.

The<br />\nWhiffenpoof Club harmonizing<br />\n\"The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi\"<br />\nwhile crooning young men<br />\nrowing on the lake strum their<br />\nukeleles and serenade their<br />\namantes. Meanwhile, back at<br />\nthe fraternity house, couples<br />\nhave strewn themselves about the<br />\nveranda engaging in some heavy<br />\nnecking, never daring-- God<br />\nforbid!--to go all the way. And if,<br />\nat the end of the evening while a<br />\nConnie Francis record coos softly<br />\nin the background, some<br />\nromantic fraternity brother pins<br />\nhis girl, she has all the right in the<br />\nworld to consider herself a<br />\n\"lucky lady\".<br />\nNeedless to say, this just is not<br />\nthe case anymore. Like all other<br />\ngreat American institutions,<br />\nfraternities have taken a severe<br />\nbeating in the last decade.<br />\nRadical ideas undermined the<br />\nbasic bourgeois concept of<br />\nfraternities, changing them into<br />\nnothing more than formalized<br />\nsocial clubs. In the late sixties,<br />\nhippies rightly charged<br />\nfraternities as being not relevant<br />\nenough, paragons of what was<br />\nwrong in America. So, like<br />\nfugitive radicals, fraternities went<br />\nunderground waiting for more<br />\npolitically petceful times to<br />\nmake a rousing comeback. Now,<br />\nwith the apathetic seventies upon<br />\nus like a shroud, frats have risen<br />\nfrom the grave and once again<br />\ngained a status that has to be<br />\nreckoned with.<br />\nI don't know what made me<br />\nattend the numberous fraternity<br />\nparties this month. Perhaps it was<br />\nthe anthropology major showing<br />\n<br />\nthrough, the relentless<br />\nethnographer gathering data for<br />\nthat ultimate monograph on<br />\nAmerican puberty rites. Or, more<br />\nlikely, the current sultry<br />\nFebruary weather brings out a<br />\nreckless streak of hedonism in<br />\nme, just as heat applied to a boil<br />\nwill bring the pus to the surface.<br />\nWhatever ther eason, I put on my<br />\nmost elegant finery and bravely<br />\nventured onto the dark Baltimore<br />\nstreets in search of cheap thrills<br />\nand fraternity parties.<br />\nI should have gone no further<br />\nthan my first stop, St. Elmo's<br />\nHall, the grand residence of Delta<br />\nPhi. In past years, Delta Phi had<br />\nachieved a nefarious and false<br />\nreputation of being nothing more<br />\nthan a den of stuffed shirts and<br />\nspoiled preppies. But the only<br />\ntruth in these allegations is in the<br />\nfraternity's boast of having \"the<br />\nhighest class drunks around.\" In<br />\nreality, Delta Phi members are no<br />\ndifferent than the rest of us<br />\nexcept they are a tad more<br />\naffluent and conservative. These<br />\nlast two traits should not be<br />\nfrowned upon because they<br />\nenable the fraternity to give the<br />\nbest parties at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nWith their virtually unlimited<br />\nresources, Delta Phi was able to<br />\nsnare Rodeo Rick for its parties.<br />\nMost importantly, for hard<br />\ndrinkers like myself, Delta Phi<br />\nhad the sense and class to have<br />\nimported Dortmunder Union<br />\nbeer and to serve it in authentic<br />\nglasses. The dark draught flowed<br />\neasily over the palate and gave<br />\nthe tastebuds a thrill they will<br />\nnot soon forget. With cries of<br />\n\"Beer here\" in the finest Yankee<br />\nStadium tradition emanating<br />\nfrom behind the bar, I forgot I<br />\nwas at a fraternity party and<br />\nstarted enjoying myself.<br />\nUsing the flimsy excuse that I<br />\nhad to pay my respects to other<br />\nfriends, I had to take leave of<br />\nDelta Phi and stumble to the<br />\nnext fraternity. Unfortunately,<br />\nfraternity X (I use the<br />\nanonymous letter due to the<br />\nstringent laws of libel) proved to<br />\nbe a foreshadowing of the<br />\nmediocore parties to follow.<br />\nWalking into X (after talking to<br />\nan Arab friend outside; X attracts<br />\nall kinds) was like entering a<br />\nfuneral parlor whose air<br />\nconditioning had broken down.<br />\nThe narrow entrance hall was<br />\n<br />\nlined with lacrosse sticks am<br />\nbodies.

But, to be<br />\non the safe side, I called my<br />\nbroker and had him buy up all<br />\nthe peanut butter futures he<br />\ncould smear on the Commodities<br />\nmarket. Then, I called Marvin<br />\nMandel in Annapolis and urged<br />\nhim to enter the race for the<br />\n<br />\nPresidency. \"Marve,\" I said, \"As<br />\nlong as Hotsy's rasing so much<br />\ngelt for you, you might as well<br />\nhave some fun and spend it on<br />\nyourself.

But<br />\nNixon didn't have it\u2014he acted<br />\nlike a self-righteous schmuck; he<br />\nembarrassed the nation, so we<br />\nforced him out. Now Marvin<br />\nwould make an extraordinarily<br />\nappealing candidate. That<br />\ncorncob pipe of his would be the<br />\nnewest status symbol. He's<br />\ndivorced\u2014but so is everybody<br />\nelse nowadays. His new wife is a<br />\ncharmer. He can have witty<br />\npeople like Louie Goldstein and<br />\nHymie Pressman as<br />\nspeechwriters.

I tell you,<br />\nthe whole ethos of the state of<br />\nMaryland could permeate the rest<br />\nof the country. It's just what<br />\nAmerica needs. N-L: So you<br />\nthink Marvin Mandel would be<br />\nthe most appealing Presidential<br />\ncandidate? Who would he getfor<br />\na finning-mate? Otto Kerner? or<br />\nTony Boyle to get the labor<br />\nvote? Burns: I was hoping for<br />\nFrank Sinatra, but Kerner does<br />\nhave a lot of class-limited name<br />\nrecognition nowadays, though.<br />\nN-L: Wouldn't the indictment<br />\nhurt Marvin?<br />\n<br />\nIt takes the best<br />\nto challen e<br />\nall the rest.<br />\n<br />\nBurns: Not at all. Only a<br />\nconviction would ruin him\u2014but<br />\nthat won't happen for a long<br />\ntime. You see, the Law is so<br />\nslow, Marvin's term as governor<br />\nwill expire before the jury is even<br />\nselected. By the way, I'm<br />\npredicting the trial will<br />\neventually be held in Sitka,<br />\nAlaska, in 1984. You need a<br />\nchange of venue. No jury in<br />\nMaryland will ever convict<br />\nMarvin of anything. The<br />\nprosecutor will insist on moving<br />\nthe trial. N-L: What will the<br />\nchatge be? Performing an illegal<br />\nnose operation on an Eskimo<br />\nwith the collaboration of Neil<br />\nSolomon, M.D.? Burns: I'll do<br />\nthe funny stuff around here. Say,<br />\nI thought your top staff writer,<br />\nRobert Fulton Buchanan, would<br />\nbe doing this interview. What<br />\nhappened to him? N-L: Sorry,<br />\nBob's tied up. Wally Orlinsky<br />\nsent him out to get the prune<br />\ndanish for Mayor Schaefer's<br />\nlunch. Burns: Well, you make a<br />\nlousy straight man. N-L: What<br />\nabout Birch Bayh?

It's far too small for me.<br />\nBut perhaps if I squeeze...\" Alice poked her<br />\nhead under the transom, squirmed into the<br />\nopening. To her great surprise, she was able<br />\nto fit her entire body through, finding this<br />\nless difficult than she had anticipated.<br />\nHer first impression of Homewoodland<br />\nwas that it wasn't very different from<br />\nwhence she had come. Still, the air was<br />\nheavier. She was not quite sure yet what the<br />\nair was heavier with, but she revelled in the<br />\nprospect of finding out. Now, where was<br />\nthat silly rabbit? He must have gone through<br />\nthat door if he...<br />\n\"Oh! Mr. Rabbit! Wait! WAIT!\"<br />\nThe white rabbit closely regarded his<br />\nLED digital calendar wristwatch and<br />\nmuttered, \"0\u201e my Goodness! Goodness<br />\nme!\" He scampered away, calculus book<br />\nunder one arm and NHS candle under the<br />\nother.<br />\n\"Wait! Mr. Rabbit! Oh, please wait up!\"<br />\nAlice tore after the curious hare. She finally<br />\nintercepted him, only by outrunning him<br />\nand standing in his path.<br />\n\"Oh, my fur and whiskers! I'm late! I'm<br />\nlate!\" He looked up at Alice from his LED<br />\ndigital calendar wristwatch and repeated,<br />\n\"I'm late, damnit! Can't stop now! I'm on<br />\nmy way to being something!\"<br />\n\"But I just wanted to...\"<br />\n\"Oh yes yes. I'd like to help. Maybe next<br />\nThursday. Good day.\" He ran off, his<br />\ncalculator case flopping at his waist.<br />\n\"But I haven't even told you...,\" the hare<br />\nwas gone. \"My, he certainly seems busy. He<br />\nmust be doing something very important,\"<br />\nshe said to no-one in particular. She could<br />\nthink of nothing to do but seek someone<br />\nelse's advice. The paths were well enough<br />\nmarked. This was fortunate, for she found<br />\nthat it would be very difficult to travel<br />\nanywhere that wasn't on a path\u2014the<br />\nunderbrush was very thick. The signs<br />\nmarked the junctions. \"Chemistry,\" one<br />\ndeclared in neat letters. Another said,<br />\n\"Writing Seminars\" in fancy script. A<br />\nwell-beaten trail was marked \"Natural<br />\nScience.\" She considered this one for -a<br />\nwhile, but found a gnaller marker under it<br />\nwhich warned, \"White Rabbits Only\u2014If<br />\nyou're anything but a white rabbit, be<br />\nassured that you sure as shit aren't likely to<br />\nreach your destination, unless, of course,<br />\nyou happen to want to be a Natural Science<br />\nanimal.\" \"That's curious,\" Alice thought.<br />\n\"What else would be the destination?\" Alice<br />\nknew that there was much to be learned<br />\nabout white rabbits.<br />\nMeanwhile she was still stuck with the<br />\ndecision as to which path should be tried.<br />\n\"Well, I've always liked science. I'll see what<br />\n'Physics' is like.\" She started down the<br />\nphysics trail.<br />\n<br />\nShe had been fighting her way across the<br />\nterrain for hours before she finally sat to<br />\nrest. \"Gee, I sure hope there are connections<br />\nbetween these trails.\" She did have a lot to<br />\nlearn about Homewoodland.<br />\nAfter properly admiring the view, she<br />\ncontinued her trek. After another hour she<br />\nrounded a pass and stopped abruptly at the<br />\nstrange sound of...coffee perking? She<br />\nstepped from the brush to find a bizarre<br />\nHatter at a nmouth table with many<br />\ncalculators and a number of coffee urns.<br />\nThe Hatter studied one calculator intensely.<br />\n\"Oh,!\" he looked up. \"Why, hello, there.<br />\nYou've come to study with me?\"<br />\n\"Well. I guess so. I mean, I just...\"<br />\n\"Wonderful! You'll find this very<br />\ninteresting. It won't all be, but well come<br />\nhere and see.\" The Hatter pointed to a<br />\nbook. The open page was covered with<br />\ndiagrams and calculations. \"If you figure<br />\nthis out, you'll understand why a stick looks<br />\nbent when half is water.\"<br />\n\"My, that should be interesting,\" Alice<br />\nsaid sincerely. She sat and poured through<br />\nthe pictures and equations. After a few<br />\nminutes she was ready to ask some<br />\nquestions, but she was cut short by the loud<br />\nwhistle from a coffee pot.<br />\n\"Oh!\" the Hatter gleamed and patted his<br />\npalms together. \"It's time to study<br />\nsomething else now.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"I don't understand. I thought I was<br />\ngoing to...\"<br />\n\"What would you like to study, dear?\"<br />\n\"Well, I'm interested in writing. And in<br />\nphilosophy. I'm also...\"<br />\n\"My dear girl. I'm interested in English<br />\nand philosophy too! But we can't spend all<br />\nour time learning that, now can we'?\"<br />\n\"Well, I should think not, but...\"<br />\n\"Then you should be pleased to study<br />\nmore physics. Don't you know that<br />\nHomewoodland is one of the finest places in<br />\nthe world to learn physics?\"<br />\n\"Well, I guess I know.\" She thought for a<br />\nmoment. Then, at the risk of being impolite,<br />\nshe asked, \"Pardon me, sir, but is there any<br />\nway to get to any of the other trails'?\"<br />\n\"The other trails? My Goodness! How old<br />\nare you, little girl?\"<br />\n\"I'm a Junior,\" Alice replied.<br />\n\"A Junior in the spring and still doubting<br />\nher path! Homewoodland is not the best<br />\nplace for you, now is it?\"<br />\n\"Well, perhaps not, then, but...well, can I<br />\nget to the other trails?\"<br />\n\"It's possible. The connections won't be<br />\nblazed for you, but you can find your way<br />\naround here if you try.\"<br />\nAnother whistle blew. The Hatter poured<br />\nhimself a cup of coffee and sat at the next<br />\nplace. Alice was sitting in contemplation<br />\nwhen a two-horned quark jumped from a<br />\ncoffeepot and shook the brown liquid from<br />\nits fur. The Hatter grabbed it stealthily and<br />\nstuffed it into another urn. \"Go back to<br />\nsleep,\" he scolded impatiently. \"I'm not<br />\nready for you yet.\" \"Silly riddler,\" he<br />\nmuttered to himself as he turned back to his<br />\nstudies.<br />\nAlice was befuddled. \"I think I should<br />\nseek the other trails just the same,\" she said.<br />\n\"Very well, then,\" the Hatter replied, not<br />\n'taking his eyes from his text. \"Best of luck.<br />\nI shan't think you'll be able to leave here on<br />\ntime.<br />\n\"Should I be anxious to leave'?\" Alice<br />\nasked innocently.<br />\n\"Why, of..why...,\" the Hatter stammered.<br />\nHe thought deeply for a moment, found<br />\nthat he could do no studying while engaged<br />\nin such evaluation.<br />\nAlice, in the meantime, took off directly<br />\ninto the thick of the woods. She found it<br />\ndifficult going, but not so hard as she would<br />\nhave thought. The underbrush was less<br />\ndense here, and the trees were more widely<br />\nspaced. \"But I have no way of knowing<br />\nwhere . I'm headed,\" she cautioned herself.<br />\nThe walk was pleasant, though, and while it<br />\nwas tougher travel than the trail, it was less<br />\nsteep.<br />\nAnd the change felt awfully good.<br />\n<br />\n.I.)<br />\n<br />\nAlice. thought this might be a good idea.<br />\nThe Hatter gestured for her to move to<br />\nthe next text at the seat beside her. Alice sat<br />\nat the new book, but found that it was more<br />\nphysics. \"Pardon me,\" she started, \"but<br />\nshouldn't this be a new subject?\"<br />\n\"Why of course! What have you got<br />\nthere?\"<br />\n\"Uhm. It's about heat. Calories.\"<br />\n\"Of course!, Of course!

The Iranian Students<br />\nAssociation (ISA) holds that the Shah has<br />\ndonated money to the Med School, and<br />\nthat the degree was granted in response to<br />\n(and in hopes of future) grants. Dr. Harry<br />\nWoolf, Provost of the University, has said,<br />\n\"We don't get any money from the<br />\nIranian government, only the fees<br />\ncovering faculty expenses at the College.\"<br />\nThe jump from the exchange program<br />\nrelationship to the degree award to<br />\nAshraf reveals a very murky process.<br />\nWoolf heads the Honorary Degree<br />\nCommittee, which is composed of seven<br />\nmembers from all divisions of the<br />\nUniversity. Dr. Richard Macksey stressed<br />\nthat the Committee is more concerned<br />\nWith the Commencement awards in May,<br />\nWhile the President customarily<br />\nnominates . the Commemoration<br />\nspeaker(s). The Committee last met<br />\nOctober 28 to review a memo sent by<br />\nWoolf listing the candidates for February<br />\nand May. \"We're not concerned on a<br />\ndiscussion basis with Commemoration<br />\nDay,\" said Macksey, \"if the Committee<br />\nexists, the Committee ratifies.\" The three<br />\nrecipients of Commemoration degrees<br />\nwere proposed by President Muller; they<br />\nwere perfunctorily . approved by the<br />\ncommittee, with no questions asked or<br />\nProtests received. No vitae, however, was<br />\nsupplied about the candidates.\"We know<br />\nthere's controversy,\" said Woolf, \"but<br />\ndon't know the facts of the charges. It<br />\nlooked pretty clean to me at the time.\"<br />\nMike Hoffheimer, a Hopkins junior and<br />\none of five persons arrested Sunday,<br />\nreplied that \"if he feels that way, it's<br />\nembarassing for an institution to not<br />\nknow what's going on in the world. How<br />\ncould it look clean, with people from<br />\nHopkins over there, seeing what's going<br />\non.\"<br />\nWoolf termed Ashraf s nomination<br />\nsymbolic\", citing her role in helping and<br />\nguiding the development of the College of<br />\nHealth Sciences. In the terms of an ISA<br />\nmember, the Princess, \"after the Shah, is<br />\nthe most hated person by all people in<br /><br />\nIran.\" Ashraf s reputation is notorious, to<br />\nsay. the least. \"Of all women in the<br />\nworld,\" stated ne faculty member,\"why<br />\nwas she singled out, a woman with that<br />\nkind of reputation, from that kind of<br />\ngovernment?\"<br />\nThe Washington Post, February 23,<br />\n1976, reported that \"one of the Shah's<br />\nclosest relatives who continues to be<br />\nsurrounded by widespread suspicion is his<br />\ntwin sister, Princess Ashraf, a world<br />\nleader in woman's rights movements. The<br />\nPrincess, whose three marriages and<br />\njet-set living style have offended many<br />\nIranians, is said to be deeply involved in a<br />\nnumber of 'shady deals'. 'Take the<br />\ntrucking industry: said a wealthy Tehran<br />\nbusinessman, 'not a truck can move<br />\nanywhere without a payoff going to<br />\nAshraf.' In the days before Iran was<br />\nswimming in oil wealth, it was widely<br />\nbelieved that Princess Ashraf profited<br />\nfrom illegal opium deals involving Iran's<br />\nlarge poppy production.\"<br />\nThis latter charge is documented by<br />\nMichael Parrish, an Indiana University<br />\nfaculty member, in the December 1962<br />\nissue of The Minority of One.\"Two years<br />\nago,\" he writes, \"the Swiss police arrested<br />\nthe Shah's sister, Princess Ashraf, for<br />\nhaving several suitcases full of heroin.\"<br />\nShe was on her way to the U.S. at the<br />\ntime. Hoffheimer added that \"she has<br />\nbeen arrested for drug-running at least<br />\nthree times in European airports,\" and<br />\nthat her diplomatic immunity had been<br />\nused to successfully carry out the<br />\noperations. Her personal trafficking may<br />\nhave been discontinued with the wealth<br />\nbrought by Iranian oil (thus freeing her to<br />\nbe a \"humanitarian\"), but Iran remains<br />\nthe country with the most addicts per<br />\npopulation (an estimated half million by<br />\nthe New York Times), and the Shah in<br />\n1969 removed a ban which prohibited the<br />\ncultivation of opium.<br />\nThe political corruption of the royal<br />\nfamily was described by Nation, April 12,<br />\n1965. It seems that the donation of<br />\nmillions of U.S. foreign aid dollars to Iran<br />\nwas quickly followed by the deposit of<br />\nmillions in a numbered Swiss bank<br />\naccount to the \"Pahlavi Foundation\".<br />\nPhotostat copies of the account revealed<br />\na $3 million check withdrawn to Ashraf,<br />\nan amount exceeded only by $15 million<br />\ngiven to the Shah's wife. Eleven years<br />\nlater the Post is still reporting on the<br />\n\"suspected\" corruption of the Shah and<br />\nhis relatives.<br />\nThe Post, though, falters in describing<br />\nAshraf \"a world leader in woman's rights<br /><br />\nmovements.\" \"Perhaps she is representing<br />\nthe rights of the woman of her type or<br />\nclass,\" said the ISA member. \"The<br />\nwomen of Iran, the workers and patriots,<br />\nare worse off than ever. The workers<br />\nmake fifty cents a day; women prisoners<br />\nare tortured and raped in front of their<br />\nhusbands and brothers.\"<br />\nThe political repression of the Shah's<br />\nregime is unquestioned. Martin Ennals,<br />\nSecretary of Amnesty International, has<br />\nstated that \"no country in the world has<br />\na worse record in human rights than<br />\nIran.\" There are an estimated 100,000<br />\npolitical prisoners (4000 women), the<br />\nmajority of whom are tortured; at least<br />\nfour hundred have been executed in the<br />\npast four years. Secret military tribunals<br />\ndecide the fate of prisoners, with<br />\ntorture-induced confessions common.<br />\nRepeated attempts by international<br />\norganizations to send observ,l<br />\nhave been<br />\nmet with forced deportations.<br />\n\"No one can claim to be naive about<br />\nthat (the political repression),\" said the<br />\nprofessor. Woolf, though, declared that<br />\n\"it's not our role to judge\" and said the<br />\ncontroversy was dismissed at the time of<br />\nselection. \"We try to have candidates<br />\nwith a bearing on the University, some<br />\nkind of proper affiliation,\" he explained.<br />\n\"The Princess was awarded as a patron of<br />\nthe University program in Iran.\" Again,<br />\nthe faculty member questioned, \"why<br />\nher, why not a doctor, or someone in the<br /><br />\nThe Princess Ashraf<br /><br />\nhealth program?\" Ashrafs position with<br />\nthe College of Health Sciences, as the<br />\n\"political and monetary backbone\"(from<br />\na Hopkins doctor involved in the<br />\nprogram), is not the result of any special<br />\nmerit; she was appointed by the Shah.,<br />\n\"When Hopkins does something like<br />\nthat,\" the ISA member said, \"it<br />\nlegitimates Iran and its reactionary<br />\nregime.\"<br />\nThe process of the degree award was<br />\nnot handled like a ceremonious event.<br />\nThe Honorary Degree Committee,<br />\nnaturally, knew of the nomination, but<br />\nboth Macksey and Dr. Owen Phillips had<br />\ntrouble recalling the minimal approval<br />\nprocedure, and 'Macksey only<br />\nremembered Ashraf when reading over<br />\nthe convocation procedure Sunday<br />\nmorning. Outside of the marshals, no<br />\nfaculty members were told of the<br />\nconferral; \"nobody had the chance to<br />\nprotest,\" said the professor. When one of<br />\nthe persons invited to be a marshal<br />\nwithdrew upon seeing the selection of the<br />\nPrincess, the University quietly ignored<br />\nhis action. Most people first found out<br />\nabout Ashraf's award at the<br />\nCommemoration Sunday.<br />\nOne group that knew well in advance,<br />\nhowever, was SAVAK, Iranian secret<br />\npolice. In cooperation with Hopkins<br />\nsecurity, federal agents (one in a Hopkins<br />\nsecurity uniform), and the Baltimore City<br />\nPolice, agents in plain clothes were at the<br />\nLyric Theater under the cover of<br />\n\"newspaper reporters\". When the<br />\ndemonstration inside the theater began,<br />\nthe SAVAK agents physically carried<br />\npeople out of the auditorium,<br />\nundertaking all the police duties up to the<br />\nactual arrest. SAVAK had meetings and<br />\nradio contact with the police; in short,<br />\nthey were condoned by the University.<br />\nBodyguards for foreign visitors is normal<br />\nprocedure, but in this case, the emphasis<br />\nwas on hiding any connection with the<br />\nIranian government.<br />\nAs for the arrest, Hoffheimer and the<br />\nfour others had to wait six hours in jail<br />\nbefore they were told of the charges<br />\nagainst them (disorderly conduct). While<br />\nthey were in the basement of the Lyric,<br />\nthe police were heard negotiating who<br />\nwas to be the arresting officer.<br />\nHoffheimer asked who the officer was;<br />\nthe reply, \"I'll tell you later.\" During the<br />\nbooking, the police were on radio talking<br />\nto Hopkins security about the charges.<br />\nApparently, the six hour delay was due to<br />\nthe time taken by the administration to<br />\ndecide on the charges. Another gloss on<br />\nthe arrest is the fact that Hopkins<br />\nsecurity guards were brought into the jail<br />\nto identify the protesters for sure<br />\nidentification at the trial later.<br />\nWith the award of the degree to Ashraf<br />\nand the arrest of the demonstrators past<br />\nhistory, the University now has to justify<br />\nits actions. The protesters did upset the<br />\nceremony, with Woolf remarking that<br />\n\"it's not a road to justice,\" and that it<br />\nwas \"a disruption of Hopkins' private<br />\ncelebration.\" Hoffheimer counters, of<br />\ncourse, that \"Ashraf is breaking into<br />\nIranian lives every day. An honorary<br />\ndegree is not a private thing; Ashraf is not<br />\njust an ordinary person.\" The<br />\npresentation of the doctorate, with the<br />\n\"short-circuit\" of the Degree Committee,<br />\nthe secrecy surrounding information<br />\nabout the award, and the Princess' and<br />\nIran's backgrounds, calls for something<br />\nbeyond the citation words of last Sunday.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letter/february 27, 1976<br /><br />\nservices<br />\nThe M.

CONSIDINE<br />\nAbout a year ago, I happened<br />\nto be in the Towson State<br />\nCollege Student Center, and in<br />\nthe course of my wanderings, I<br />\nnoticed music pervading the<br />\ngeneral hotel-lobby atmosphere<br />\nof the building. Muzak, I figured<br />\n(although it was far more hip<br />\nthan the general WLIF fare);<br />\nuntil a voice was discerned<br />\nmumbling some explanation of<br />\nwhat was played.<br />\nThis was WVTS, Towson's<br />\ncarrier current station. Like most<br />\ncarrier current stations, it had a<br />\nlimited following, intermittant<br />\nbroadcast hours, and very little<br />\npotential. Unbeknownst to the<br />\ngeneral public, though, help was<br />\non the way: FM.<br />\nRight now, Towson is in its<br />\nthird week of FM programming,<br />\nwith WCVT-FM a broadcast<br />\nreality at 89. What may seem to<br />\nbe an overnight transition,<br />\nhowever, was anything but<br />\nsudden; the metamorphosis of<br />\nCarrier Current to FM took over<br />\nthree years.<br />\nWhat does it take to go FM?<br />\n\"A lot of work,\" to quote station<br />\nmanager Steve Curran. Outside of<br />\nthe basic procedure of obtaining<br />\npermission, a frequency, and a<br />\nlicense there are the problems<br />\ninvolved in equipment.<br />\nFirst of all, money. The cost<br />\nfor Towson's FM station has<br />\nbeen almost entirely for<br />\nequipment, and has totalled<br />\napproximately $36,000. With the<br />\nexception of the tower<br />\nconstruction ( due to county<br />\nlaws), all equipment installation<br />\nhas been done by _student<br />\nvolunteers.<br />\nBut there were also problems<br />\nwith personnel, and fulfilling the<br />\nF.C.C. guidelines for an<br />\nEducational FM station.<br />\nFor starters, the station is<br />\nalmost entirely student staffed<br />\nand managed. This creates a<br />\nstrong core of support for the<br />\nstation, but it also has<br />\ndrawbacks. When exams and<br />\nvacations occur, it will not be<br />\neasy to get all the DJ's to their<br />\nshows, let alone on time.<br />\n\"Mid-terms are coming up,\" says<br />\nCurran, \"and this should be an<br />\nindication of how things will go.\"<br />\nAlthough he expects to weather<br />\nthe exams, the end of the term<br />\nposes yet another problem. Even<br />\nwith 90% of the staff living in the<br />\narea as full-time residents, Curran<br />\nexpects scheduling problems.<br />\nAs an educational station, they<br />\nare obligated to serve the<br />\ncommunity, which right now is<br />\nnot easy. \"Since we went on in<br />\nMid-term, we really couldn't start<br />\nany educational courses-by-radio,<br />\n\"Curran stated.<br />\nFor now, they have two<br />\nstudent created and produced<br />\neducational programs, Media<br />\nMakers and Business Beat,<br />\nbroadcast from 9:00-9:30<br />\nweekdays. The rest of the<br />\nprogramming is based on<br />\nClassical music from 6:00-9:00<br />\na.m., and Jazz from 8:00 to<br />\nmidnight. The rest of the<br />\nbroadcast day is 'progressive<br />\nradio'.\"<br />\nDoesn't all that progressive<br />\nsound like typical carrier-current<br />\nradio? \"Yeah, and I'm not too<br /><br />\npleased, but at the moment,<br />\nthere's not a whole lot I can do,\"<br />\nsaid Curran. \"We're a new<br />\nstation, and we've still got a lot<br />\nof growing to do.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the chances<br />\nfor an FM station at Hopkins,<br />\nCurran gave this evaluation:<br />\n\"I really can't see Hopkins<br />\nwith an FM station for at least<br />\nfive years. There's a lot of<br />\npreliminary action that has to be<br />\ntaken, and one thing that is<br />\nessential is an experienced<br />\nAdvisor, with radio background<br />\nand an F.C.C. first class license.<br /><br />\nIt just makes everything so much<br />\neasier; he would know how to fill<br />\nout the forms, how to deal with<br />\nthe government officials.<br />\n\"As for a Mass Comm<br />\nprogram, you don't need to be a<br />\nMass Comm major to be in radio.<br />\nYou could just as easily be an Art<br />\nStudent.<br />\n\"It's fastest if you can get all<br />\nvolunteers. Of course it will take<br />\ntime; you've got to expect it to<br />\nchange hands. But we had full<br />\nsupport of our Student<br />\nGovernment, and it's taken a<br />\nlong time, but we're here.\"<br /><br />\nThe return of the<br />\nThin White Duke<br />\nStation to Station, David<br />\nBowie's latest lp, is already<br />\nbeginning to generate a<br />\nsnowballing excitement with<br />\nmultiple hits flying out of radios<br />\ninto the waiting ears of his<br />\nbeloved young Americans. The<br />\n\"Thin White Duke\" is staging<br />\nmore than a return; the boy with<br />\nthe animal grace has carefully<br />\nmapped out a Bowie year; after<br />\nthe whirlwind coast-to-coast<br />\ntour, a movie will be released for<br />\nall of us to gawk and coo at, and<br />\nfrom there Bowie's momentum<br />\nand ability to mesmerize his<br />\naudience could carry him<br />\nanywhere\u2014perhaps to his own<br />\nrecently disclosed fancy of ruling<br />\nthe world.<br />\nThough Bowie has more fans<br />\nthan ever, long-standing<br />\naficionados of the man can only<br />\nfeel some disappointment at the<br />\ngeneral musical mediocrity of<br />\nStation to Station. It is a<br />\nreflection of Bowie's lastest<br />\nremarks in Rolling Stone<br />\nmagazine where he denounced<br />\nrock 'n roll. as \"musical soma,\"<br />\nvery close to \"becoming an<br />\nimmobile, sterile fascist that<br />\nconstantly spews its propaganda<br />\non every arm of the media.\" But<br />\nthe writing on the new album<br />\nremains intensely personal, joyful<br />\nand optimistic, having its roots in<br />\nThinky Dory and earlier works.<br />\nThe new devotees applaud the<br />\nabsense of glitter and feminine<br /><br />\ngarb, but it should be<br />\nremembered that the<br />\nandrogynous darling has always<br />\nremained a few steps ahead of<br />\nthe pack and now points to a<br />\nmellowing in these golden years.<br />\nThere can be no doubt that<br />\nDavid Bowie is about to make his<br />\nbid for messiah, a role he's<br />\ngroomed himself for these last<br />\nseven years. What is scary is that<br />\nBowie's remarks on the potential<br />\ndangers of popular music seem to<br />\nbe exactly what he is<br />\ntrying\u2014except that I think he has<br />\nsome important things to say.<br />\nalways has. He is about to launch<br />\na cinema career and start his own<br />\nproduction \u2022 company. To be sure.<br />\nthe future theatrics of David<br />\nBowie will be more interesting<br />\nthan national political struggles<br />\nto the average American. Let's<br />\nhope -somebody , maybe even<br />\nBowie himself, has enough<br />\ncommon sense to keep things uI<br />\nperspective.<br />\nBut remember, we are dealing<br />\nwith the one and only ZiggY<br />\nStardust. Bowie has put down his<br />\npast roles, but Ziggy was an<br />\namazing piece of autobiography,<br />\nand has so far proven to be the<br />\ntrue David Bowie story.'<br />\nWe are about to witness not<br />\nonly Bowie's rock 'n roll suicide,<br />\nbut most likely ours as well.<br />\nDavid Bowie will be appearing<br />\nat the Capitol Center on March<br />\n13 and 14.<br />\ndint,<br /><br />\nfebruary 27,1976/news-letter/page 5<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 Can<br /><br />\n'76 flicks<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nA playboy enterprises film<br />\n7:30 and 11:00 PM<br /><br />\nIT IS A JOY!<br /><br />\nAn onehaning ma:union Ws Oho joy.'living.

First, you<br />\nmight have criticized the<br />\noverabundance of these<br />\nsymposia. No mind, trapped<br />\nwithin a single body, could have<br />\nbeen exposed to even a majority<br />\nof the participants' .comments.<br />\nSecond\u2014and this is quite serious<br />\nin a journal with any pretension<br />\nto respectability\u2014 the review of<br />\nhe symposium on \"The<br /><br />\nResponsibilities of the Critic\"<br />\nwas left unsigned. This is<br />\ninexcusable, however just the<br />\nopinions of the reviewer.<br />\nMaurice Mathis<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHopkins cannot expect to<br />\nendure another 100 years as a<br />\nprivate educational institution<br />\nunless the university respects the<br />\nright of individuals to speak<br />\nfreely. By pressing charges<br />\nagainst the persons who<br />\ndemonstrated at the centennial<br />\ncelebration, JHU is compounding<br />\nits disgrace. Without further<br />\nmoralizing, I urge the University<br />\nto drop these outrageous charges.<br />\nMarie Nally<br /><br />\nwomen led<br />\nher to mobilize the educated and<br />\naffluent women of her country.<br />\nThe organization which resulted<br />\nfrom this activity has evolved<br />\ninto a model center for service to<br />\nwomen. Pricess Ashraf holds as a<br />\nbasic truth the proposition that<br />\nonly when women achieve their<br />\nfull potential in human society<br />\nwill men achieve theirs.<br />\nWhen Her Imperial Highness<br />\nwas appointed to the United<br />\nNations as chief of the Iranian<br />\ndelegation, she exploited this<br />\ninternational forum to continue<br />\nher dedication to humanitarian<br />\ncuases. In 1968, she became the<br />\nfirst woman to preside over a<br />\nmajor international<br />\nproceeding\u2014the International<br />\nConference on Human Rights. In<br />\n1975, she was instrumental in the<br />\norganization of the International<br />\nWomen's Year Program and was a<br />\nmajor author of the World Plan<br />\nof Action approved in Mexico<br />\nCity by delegates from 130<br />\nnations calling for the<br />\nachievement of full and equal<br />\nrights for women throughout the<br />\nworld in the course of the next<br /><br />\ndecade.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhas a special interest in the honor<br />\nwe bestow today upon Princess<br />\nAshraf. Medical care, particularly<br />\nfor those outside major<br />\npopulation centers, is one of her<br />\ncountry's most critical problems.<br />\nOver the years, many Iranian<br />\nphysicians have received their<br />\ntraining at Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nbecause of that earlier experience<br />\nan academic exchange program<br />\nhas been established between this<br />\nUniversity and the College of<br />\nHealth Sciences at the Reza<br />\nPahlavi Medical Center in Tehran.<br />\nThe goal is to develop a broad<br />\nspectrum of health professionals<br />\nto meet the specific needs of<br />\nIran, where over half the<br />\npopulation still resides in small<br />\nvillages.<br /><br />\nThis program has by no means<br />\nbeen an unidirectional learning<br />\nexperience. Physicians in this<br />\ncountry, too, are clustered<br />\naround population centers, and<br />\nthe solutions found in Iran to the<br />\nproblem of maldistiibution<br />\nmedical care may have a<br />\nsignificant impact upon the<br />\ndelivery of medical care in the<br />\nUnited States. The success of this<br />\nentire effort is no small measure<br />\nof a reflection of the foresight of<br />\nPrincess Ashraf, who earlY<br />\nrecognized the needs of her<br />\npeople and helped bring together<br />\nher country's resources to meet<br />\nthose needs.<br />\nMr. President, it is a distinct<br />\npleasure to present for the degree<br />\nof Doctor of Laws, Her Imperial<br />\nHighness, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi<br />\nof Iran.<br /><br />\nwore voices_<br />\nDr. Owen Phillips, Honorary Degree Committee, about the Princess'<br />\nselection:<br />\n\"I wouldn't like to say it didn't happen, but it didn't impress itself<br />\nupon me very 'flitch.\"<br />\nISA member:<br />\n\"Considering the nature of A shraf: the political prisoners, the living<br />\nconditions (in Iran), and the women's position, workers and patriots.<br />\nHopkins' corroboration with the Shah is revealed. . . as support ofone<br />\nofthe most reactionary regimes in the world.''<br />\nDr. Richard Macksey, Honorary Degree Committee:<br />\n\"We tend not to think in political terms. . . it's traditionally the<br />\npurview of the President to make nominations (for the<br />\nCommemoration).<br />\nDr. Harry Woolf, Provost, head of Honorary Degree Committee;about<br />\nhis presentation:<br />\n\"That's what I presented to the community, that's vhat I believe to be<br />\ntrue. Personally, now I have some qualms. . . I don't think any major<br />\noffice (of the University) should be absolved . . . she's not our best<br />\ncandidate.\"<br /><br />\nMike Hoffheimer, Hopkins student arrested at Commemoration:<br />\n\"Giving A shraf an honorary doctorate is a disgrace to Hopkins and an<br />\ninsult to the Iranian people. We demand that the degree be revoked and<br />\nthe charges against the protesters dropped. Ashraf is notorious as a<br />\nmurderer and a drug-pusher;if Muller or Woolf think otherwise, we will<br />\npublicly debate them anytime, anyplace.\"<br />\nFaculty member:<br />\n\"You can ask all the political questions, but why on the Centennial<br />\nprecisely the ceremony that should be bringing us all together? ...she<br />\nrepresents everything politically and morally bad; it was just an awful<br />\nthing (the award), in monumental bad taste . . .

The<br />\nyoung man was quickly quieted<br />\nby security forces, but the<br />\noutburst was too dramatic to<br />\nshrug off. Most people stared at<br />\nthe balcony as the celebration<br />\nproceeded, wondering what was<br />\nnex t.<br />\nNext<br />\nThey found out soon enough.<br />\nWoolrs introduction of the<br />\nPrincess was met with screams of<br />\nprotest from all sides of the<br />\nbalcony, and for a while the<br /><br />\nCelebrating the One Hundreth<br />\nAnniversary<br />\nof the founding of the University<br />\nSunday, Febmary 22,1976<br />\n3:00 p.m.<br />\nLyric Theatre<br />\nSeveral prominent persons from<br />\nthe United States and abroad will<br />\nParticipate in these ceremonies as<br />\nspeakers and as recipients of<br />\nhonorary degrees to be awarded<br />\nto them by the University. This<br />\nevents will be the major<br />\nceremony of the Centennial<br />\nYear.<br />\nIt'd be safe to say that the<br />\nperson who hacked out the above<br />\nblurb should be hawking fortunes<br />\ninstead of wasting away at the<br />\npublicity desk of the Office of<br />\nSpecial Events.<br />\nMost of us were tricked. I<br />\nmean,to the men and women in<br />\nShriver and Garland Halls, all<br />\nUniversity ceremonies are major,<br />\nand so the publicist inevitably<br />\ntrumps the affair up for more<br />\nthan it actually is. Usually,<br />\nCommemoration Day<br />\ncelebrations are dull to begin<br />\nwith, and as they proceed,<br />\nbecome duller yet. It's true that<br />\nthe procession is quite a<br />\nspectacle, and even inspiring for a<br />\nfew crazy moments, but its<br />\nnovelty is gone once the speeches<br />\nbegin. Therefore, when we read<br />\nthat this event was major, well,<br />\nthat didn't say a hell of a lot.<br />\nBut wehad no idea. Who knew<br />\nthat Hopkins was tossing an<br />\nhonorary degree to a woman who<br />\nis not only tied to the tyrannical<br />\nIranian government, but alleged<br />\nto have overseen vast drug<br />\nsmuggling units as well? Who<br />\nwould have guessed that the<br />\nCentennial Convocation would<br />\nbe the leading story on the<br />\nSunday night late news? And<br />\nwho could have predicted that<br />\nSteven Muller would emerge<br />\nfrom the Centennial finale with a<br />\nstain on his administration<br />\ninstead of the crown everyone<br />\nhad expected.<br />\nAs friends of the Universio<br />\narrived at the Lyric Theatre,<br />\nscattered groups were<br />\ndistributing leaflets outside, but<br />\nin numbers no greater than those<br />\nusually brought out by a<br />\ngathering of this size. An obvious<br />\nthought was that maybe the<br />\nLabor Party would continue their<br />\nharassment of Muller inside, but<br />\nthen, Shriver Hall, scene of past<br />\ninterruptions, was not quite the<br />\nLyric.<br />\nThe ceremony began<br />\nsmoothly. The Baltimore<br />\nSymphony set a dignified tone,<br />\nJohn Barth played announcer<br />\nwhen the procession started, and<br />\nall the Hopkins heavyweights<br />\nfound their places on stage. Had<br />\nnothing else happened that day,<br />\nthe chief irony would have been<br />\nthe presence of Lincoln Gordon,<br />\nwho was seated next to Muller<br />\nwhile Robert D. H. Harvey<br />\npraised the current president for<br />\nhis restoration of Hopkin's<br />\nfinances. As it turns out, that<br />\nlittle twist will rate as mere trivia<br />\nwhen this Commemoration Day<br />\nis remembered.<br />\nProvost Harry Woolf was<br />\nspeaking when the first cry of<br />\n\"disgrace, Ashraf is a criminal\"<br /><br />\nLyric was a wild mess. Hopkins<br />\nand Iranian security men gagged<br />\nand tackled the intruders, trying<br />\nto hide them from the audience's<br />\nsight. Some of the distinguished<br />\nguests clapped ferociously, in an<br />\nattempt to muffle the cries of<br />\n\"disgrace!\" In a few minutes, the<br />\ndemonstrators were gone, hustled<br />\ndown to Central District to be<br />\nbooked. But they just might have<br />\ntaken something with them that,<br />\nalumni dollars and huzzahs<br />\nnotwithstanding, in the words of<br /><br />\nSteven Muller, cannot be<br />\nbought\u2014the integrity of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nOutside<br />\nOutside the Lyric, a full scale<br />\ndemonstration was taking place.<br />\nSwarms of masked members of<br />\nthe Iranian Student Association<br />\nmarched in front of the theatre,<br />\nchanting a slogan like \"Shah is a<br />\nfascist butcher, down with the<br />\nShah!\" and frantically relating<br />\ntheir story to the reporters and<br />\ncamera men who rushed about<br /><br />\nDavid Porter<br /><br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nConvocation Day<br />\nCeremonies<br /><br />\nPresident and Princess<br /><br />\nthem.<br />\nInside, the audience listened t(<br />\nLord Ashby's address, stil<br />\nconfused about the controvers:<br />\nthat was just beginning.

And a<br />\nunderstandably tired Steve<br />\nMuller talked brief':<br />\nthe protest, saying that hi<br />\n'neither endorsed no<br />\ncondemned the Shah of Iran,'<br />\nand that he didn't know abou<br />\nthe charges of criminalit'<br />\ndirected at the Princess.<br />\nIt doesn't matter now if tha<br />\nlast comment was sincere or jus\u2022<br />\na slick reply, for by now th(<br />\nPrincess' honorary degree h<br />\nnothing less than Steven Muller':<br />\npersonal albatross.<br /><br />\nDelta Phi tops brands X, IT and Z easily<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\nFraternity Party!<br />\nThe phrase alone harkens<br />\nvisions of old movies and foolish<br />\ndreams, of more prosaic times<br />\nwhen the threat of communism<br />\nwas not yet upon the land. Ali<br />\nyes, I can see it now. The<br />\nWhiffenpoof Club harmonizing<br />\n\"The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi\"<br />\nwhile crooning young men<br />\nrowing on the lake strum their<br />\nukeleles and serenade their<br />\namantes. Meanwhile, back at<br />\nthe fraternity house, couples<br />\nhave strewn themselves about the<br />\nveranda engaging in some heavy<br />\nnecking, never daring-- God<br />\nforbid!--to go all the way. And if,<br />\nat the end of the evening while a<br />\nConnie Francis record coos softly<br />\nin the background, some<br />\nromantic fraternity brother pins<br />\nhis girl, she has all the right in the<br />\nworld to consider herself a<br />\n\"lucky lady\".<br />\nNeedless to say, this just is not<br />\nthe case anymore. Like all other<br />\ngreat American institutions,<br />\nfraternities have taken a severe<br />\nbeating in the last decade.<br />\nRadical ideas undermined the<br />\nbasic bourgeois concept of<br />\nfraternities, changing them into<br />\nnothing more than formalized<br />\nsocial clubs. In the late sixties,<br />\nhippies rightly charged<br />\nfraternities as being not relevant<br />\nenough, paragons of what was<br />\nwrong in America. So, like<br />\nfugitive radicals, fraternities went<br />\nunderground waiting for more<br />\npolitically petceful times to<br />\nmake a rousing comeback. Now,<br />\nwith the apathetic seventies upon<br />\nus like a shroud, frats have risen<br />\nfrom the grave and once again<br />\ngained a status that has to be<br />\nreckoned with.<br />\nI don't know what made me<br />\nattend the numberous fraternity<br />\nparties this month. Perhaps it was<br />\nthe anthropology major showing<br /><br />\nthrough, the relentless<br />\nethnographer gathering data for<br />\nthat ultimate monograph on<br />\nAmerican puberty rites. Or, more<br />\nlikely, the current sultry<br />\nFebruary weather brings out a<br />\nreckless streak of hedonism in<br />\nme, just as heat applied to a boil<br />\nwill bring the pus to the surface.<br />\nWhatever ther eason, I put on my<br />\nmost elegant finery and bravely<br />\nventured onto the dark Baltimore<br />\nstreets in search of cheap thrills<br />\nand fraternity parties.<br />\nI should have gone no further<br />\nthan my first stop, St. Elmo's<br />\nHall, the grand residence of Delta<br />\nPhi. In past years, Delta Phi had<br />\nachieved a nefarious and false<br />\nreputation of being nothing more<br />\nthan a den of stuffed shirts and<br />\nspoiled preppies. But the only<br />\ntruth in these allegations is in the<br />\nfraternity's boast of having \"the<br />\nhighest class drunks around.\" In<br />\nreality, Delta Phi members are no<br />\ndifferent than the rest of us<br />\nexcept they are a tad more<br />\naffluent and conservative. These<br />\nlast two traits should not be<br />\nfrowned upon because they<br />\nenable the fraternity to give the<br />\nbest parties at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nWith their virtually unlimited<br />\nresources, Delta Phi was able to<br />\nsnare Rodeo Rick for its parties.<br />\nMost importantly, for hard<br />\ndrinkers like myself, Delta Phi<br />\nhad the sense and class to have<br />\nimported Dortmunder Union<br />\nbeer and to serve it in authentic<br />\nglasses. The dark draught flowed<br />\neasily over the palate and gave<br />\nthe tastebuds a thrill they will<br />\nnot soon forget. With cries of<br />\n\"Beer here\" in the finest Yankee<br />\nStadium tradition emanating<br />\nfrom behind the bar, I forgot I<br />\nwas at a fraternity party and<br />\nstarted enjoying myself.<br />\nUsing the flimsy excuse that I<br />\nhad to pay my respects to other<br />\nfriends, I had to take leave of<br />\nDelta Phi and stumble to the<br />\nnext fraternity. Unfortunately,<br />\nfraternity X (I use the<br />\nanonymous letter due to the<br />\nstringent laws of libel) proved to<br />\nbe a foreshadowing of the<br />\nmediocore parties to follow.<br />\nWalking into X (after talking to<br />\nan Arab friend outside; X attracts<br />\nall kinds) was like entering a<br />\nfuneral parlor whose air<br />\nconditioning had broken down.<br />\nThe narrow entrance hall was<br /><br />\nlined with lacrosse sticks am<br />\nbodies.

The band sounded as<br />\nif their last gig was at the Kit Kat<br />\nKlub on Pulaski Highway. On the<br />\nspacious dance floor, several girls<br />\nhustled with each other.

N-L: What was your<br />\nreaction when you heard of<br />\nCarter's New Hampshire victory?<br />\nBurns: It wasn't a victory! We've<br />\nJust been through that. But, to be<br />\non the safe side, I called my<br />\nbroker and had him buy up all<br />\nthe peanut butter futures he<br />\ncould smear on the Commodities<br />\nmarket. Then, I called Marvin<br />\nMandel in Annapolis and urged<br />\nhim to enter the race for the<br /><br />\nPresidency. \"Marve,\" I said, \"As<br />\nlong as Hotsy's rasing so much<br />\ngelt for you, you might as well<br />\nhave some fun and spend it on<br />\nyourself.

We don't want Our<br /><br />\nleaders to be saints\u2014as long as<br />\nthey can carry off their sins well,<br />\nwe support them. Teddy<br />\nKennedy could win.

But<br />\nNixon didn't have it\u2014he acted<br />\nlike a self-righteous schmuck; he<br />\nembarrassed the nation, so we<br />\nforced him out. Now Marvin<br />\nwould make an extraordinarily<br />\nappealing candidate. That<br />\ncorncob pipe of his would be the<br />\nnewest status symbol. He's<br />\ndivorced\u2014but so is everybody<br />\nelse nowadays. His new wife is a<br />\ncharmer. He can have witty<br />\npeople like Louie Goldstein and<br />\nHymie Pressman as<br />\nspeechwriters. Marvin should<br /><br />\nstart a new political party\u2014the<br />\nLand of Pleasant Living Party;<br />\nrun on a platform of steamed<br />\ncrabs, beer, race tracks, lottery<br />\ntickets, legalized off-track betting<br />\nand no-fault divorce. I tell you,<br />\nthe whole ethos of the state of<br />\nMaryland could permeate the rest<br />\nof the country. It's just what<br />\nAmerica needs. N-L: So you<br />\nthink Marvin Mandel would be<br />\nthe most appealing Presidential<br />\ncandidate? Who would he getfor<br />\na finning-mate? Otto Kerner? or<br />\nTony Boyle to get the labor<br />\nvote? Burns: I was hoping for<br />\nFrank Sinatra, but Kerner does<br />\nhave a lot of class-limited name<br />\nrecognition nowadays, though.<br />\nN-L: Wouldn't the indictment<br />\nhurt Marvin?<br /><br />\nIt takes the best<br />\nto challen e<br />\nall the rest.<br /><br />\nBurns: Not at all. Only a<br />\nconviction would ruin him\u2014but<br />\nthat won't happen for a long<br />\ntime. You see, the Law is so<br />\nslow, Marvin's term as governor<br />\nwill expire before the jury is even<br />\nselected.

Against the Tigers,<br />\nHopkins unleashed its most<br />\nfurious offensive barrage of the<br />\nseason, papering the Princeton<br />\nnet with 22 goals!<br /><br />\nAll this resulted in a number<br />\none ranking for the Homewood<br />\nstickmen and set-up the first of<br />\ntwo consecutive clashes which<br />\nwould truly test the Jays'<br />\nstrength.

It's far too small for me.<br />\nBut perhaps if I squeeze...\" Alice poked her<br />\nhead under the transom, squirmed into the<br />\nopening. To her great surprise, she was able<br />\nto fit her entire body through, finding this<br />\nless difficult than she had anticipated.<br />\nHer first impression of Homewoodland<br />\nwas that it wasn't very different from<br />\nwhence she had come. Still, the air was<br />\nheavier. She was not quite sure yet what the<br />\nair was heavier with, but she revelled in the<br />\nprospect of finding out. Now, where was<br />\nthat silly rabbit? He must have gone through<br />\nthat door if he...<br />\n\"Oh! Mr. Rabbit! Wait! WAIT!\"<br />\nThe white rabbit closely regarded his<br />\nLED digital calendar wristwatch and<br />\nmuttered, \"0\u201e my Goodness! Goodness<br />\nme!\" He scampered away, calculus book<br />\nunder one arm and NHS candle under the<br />\nother.<br />\n\"Wait! Mr. Rabbit! Oh, please wait up!\"<br />\nAlice tore after the curious hare. She finally<br />\nintercepted him, only by outrunning him<br />\nand standing in his path.<br />\n\"Oh, my fur and whiskers! I'm late! I'm<br />\nlate!\" He looked up at Alice from his LED<br />\ndigital calendar wristwatch and repeated,<br />\n\"I'm late, damnit! Can't stop now! I'm on<br />\nmy way to being something!\"<br />\n\"But I just wanted to...\"<br />\n\"Oh yes yes. I'd like to help. Maybe next<br />\nThursday. Good day.\" He ran off, his<br />\ncalculator case flopping at his waist.<br />\n\"But I haven't even told you...,\" the hare<br />\nwas gone. \"My, he certainly seems busy. He<br />\nmust be doing something very important,\"<br />\nshe said to no-one in particular. She could<br />\nthink of nothing to do but seek someone<br />\nelse's advice. The paths were well enough<br />\nmarked. This was fortunate, for she found<br />\nthat it would be very difficult to travel<br />\nanywhere that wasn't on a path\u2014the<br />\nunderbrush was very thick. The signs<br />\nmarked the junctions. \"Chemistry,\" one<br />\ndeclared in neat letters. Another said,<br />\n\"Writing Seminars\" in fancy script. A<br />\nwell-beaten trail was marked \"Natural<br />\nScience.\" She considered this one for -a<br />\nwhile, but found a gnaller marker under it<br />\nwhich warned, \"White Rabbits Only\u2014If<br />\nyou're anything but a white rabbit, be<br />\nassured that you sure as shit aren't likely to<br />\nreach your destination, unless, of course,<br />\nyou happen to want to be a Natural Science<br />\nanimal.\" \"That's curious,\" Alice thought.<br />\n\"What else would be the destination?\" Alice<br />\nknew that there was much to be learned<br />\nabout white rabbits.<br />\nMeanwhile she was still stuck with the<br />\ndecision as to which path should be tried.<br />\n\"Well, I've always liked science. I'll see what<br />\n'Physics' is like.\" She started down the<br />\nphysics trail.<br /><br />\nShe had been fighting her way across the<br />\nterrain for hours before she finally sat to<br />\nrest. \"Gee, I sure hope there are connections<br />\nbetween these trails.\" She did have a lot to<br />\nlearn about Homewoodland.<br />\nAfter properly admiring the view, she<br />\ncontinued her trek. After another hour she<br />\nrounded a pass and stopped abruptly at the<br />\nstrange sound of...coffee perking? She<br />\nstepped from the brush to find a bizarre<br />\nHatter at a nmouth table with many<br />\ncalculators and a number of coffee urns.<br />\nThe Hatter studied one calculator intensely.<br />\n\"Oh,!\" he looked up. \"Why, hello, there.<br />\nYou've come to study with me?\"<br />\n\"Well. I guess so. I mean, I just...\"<br />\n\"Wonderful! You'll find this very<br />\ninteresting. It won't all be, but well come<br />\nhere and see.\" The Hatter pointed to a<br />\nbook. The open page was covered with<br />\ndiagrams and calculations. \"If you figure<br />\nthis out, you'll understand why a stick looks<br />\nbent when half is water.\"<br />\n\"My, that should be interesting,\" Alice<br />\nsaid sincerely. She sat and poured through<br />\nthe pictures and equations. After a few<br />\nminutes she was ready to ask some<br />\nquestions, but she was cut short by the loud<br />\nwhistle from a coffee pot.<br />\n\"Oh!\" the Hatter gleamed and patted his<br />\npalms together. \"It's time to study<br />\nsomething else now.\"<br /><br />\n\"I don't understand. I thought I was<br />\ngoing to...\"<br />\n\"What would you like to study, dear?\"<br />\n\"Well, I'm interested in writing. And in<br />\nphilosophy. I'm also...\"<br />\n\"My dear girl. I'm interested in English<br />\nand philosophy too! But we can't spend all<br />\nour time learning that, now can we'?\"<br />\n\"Well, I should think not, but...\"<br />\n\"Then you should be pleased to study<br />\nmore physics. Don't you know that<br />\nHomewoodland is one of the finest places in<br />\nthe world to learn physics?\"<br />\n\"Well, I guess I know.\" She thought for a<br />\nmoment. Then, at the risk of being impolite,<br />\nshe asked, \"Pardon me, sir, but is there any<br />\nway to get to any of the other trails'?\"<br />\n\"The other trails? My Goodness! How old<br />\nare you, little girl?\"<br />\n\"I'm a Junior,\" Alice replied.<br />\n\"A Junior in the spring and still doubting<br />\nher path! Homewoodland is not the best<br />\nplace for you, now is it?\"<br />\n\"Well, perhaps not, then, but...well, can I<br />\nget to the other trails?\"<br />\n\"It's possible. The connections won't be<br />\nblazed for you, but you can find your way<br />\naround here if you try.\"<br />\nAnother whistle blew. The Hatter poured<br />\nhimself a cup of coffee and sat at the next<br />\nplace. Alice was sitting in contemplation<br />\nwhen a two-horned quark jumped from a<br />\ncoffeepot and shook the brown liquid from<br />\nits fur. The Hatter grabbed it stealthily and<br />\nstuffed it into another urn. \"Go back to<br />\nsleep,\" he scolded impatiently. \"I'm not<br />\nready for you yet.\" \"Silly riddler,\" he<br />\nmuttered to himself as he turned back to his<br />\nstudies.<br />\nAlice was befuddled. \"I think I should<br />\nseek the other trails just the same,\" she said.<br />\n\"Very well, then,\" the Hatter replied, not<br />\n'taking his eyes from his text. \"Best of luck.<br />\nI shan't think you'll be able to leave here on<br />\ntime.<br />\n\"Should I be anxious to leave'?\" Alice<br />\nasked innocently.<br />\n\"Why, of..why...,\" the Hatter stammered.<br />\nHe thought deeply for a moment, found<br />\nthat he could do no studying while engaged<br />\nin such evaluation.<br />\nAlice, in the meantime, took off directly<br />\ninto the thick of the woods. She found it<br />\ndifficult going, but not so hard as she would<br />\nhave thought. The underbrush was less<br />\ndense here, and the trees were more widely<br />\nspaced. \"But I have no way of knowing<br />\nwhere . I'm headed,\" she cautioned herself.<br />\nThe walk was pleasant, though, and while it<br />\nwas tougher travel than the trail, it was less<br />\nsteep.<br />\nAnd the change felt awfully good.<br /><br />\n.I.)<br /><br />\nAlice. thought this might be a good idea.<br />\nThe Hatter gestured for her to move to<br />\nthe next text at the seat beside her. Alice sat<br />\nat the new book, but found that it was more<br />\nphysics. \"Pardon me,\" she started, \"but<br />\nshouldn't this be a new subject?\"<br />\n\"Why of course! What have you got<br />\nthere?\"<br />\n\"Uhm. It's about heat. Calories.\"<br />\n\"Of course!, Of course! A marvelous<br />\ntopic!\"<br />\n\"But...\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41105, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "e7dd2f89-6381-46b6-90c1-0ee11ccebadd", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14306-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14306, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "96b8d3da-c71e-4310-bd61-1fa233336db7", "url": "/node/14306"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "a2883340-5ac2-4cfd-9057-c6220eb55e88"}]}
