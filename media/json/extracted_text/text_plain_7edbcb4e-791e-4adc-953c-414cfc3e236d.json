Let us attempt to explain exactly<br />\nwhat the policy of the paper under its current editors has been,<br />\nand what it will continue to be.<br />\nThe aim and policy of the News-Letter's news coverage is the<br />\nsame as that of any reputable paper: to cover happenings in its<br />\ncommunity in an honest and unbiased manner, giving the truth<br />\nwithout distortions unnecessarily injurious to its community.<br />\nWe work to publish the news. We accept with one reservation<br />\nthe definition of news given above. It is admittedly vague, for news<br />\nvaries with readership for any paper or magazine. The reservation<br />\nwe place on the definition is simple: As a publication of a nonprofit educational institution we are obligated to avoid coverage<br />\nwhich will unnecessarily injure the reputation of the university<br />\nor seriously hamper its educational processes.<br />\nThe words \"unnecessarily injure\" need further discussion.<br />\nThe way we can injure the university is by publishing accounts of<br />\nuniversity activities which have hitherto been kept out of the<br />\npublic eye because they were considered to be unrepresentative<br />\nbad publicity. Certain items, if dramatically treated, assume a<br />\nnews value out of proportion to their importance in the University.<br />\nItems of this sort must be underplayed, since whatever the NewsLetter publishes becomes fair game to any interested publication<br />\nor news service in the country.<br />\nThe News-Letter, however, is obligated only to avoid distorting<br />\nthe news by emphasis or fabrication. It is not obligated to cover<br />\n-up for the university or its member organizations, nor is it obligated<br />\nto suppress news. The university, and all its individual organizations, must stand behind their own decisions, right or wrong,<br />\nand take the consequences of their actions, good or bad. They<br />\ncannot escape this by expecting the News-Letter to print only the<br />\nright decisions and the good publicity. To do this would reduce<br />\nthe News-Letter from a journalistic publication to a press agent's<br />\ntip sheet.<br />\nThat is what the News-Letter should not do. Now let us examine the things it should do. Its obligations here are three-fold:<br />\nto its readers, to its news sources, and to its staff. The readers of the<br />\nNows-Letter are entitled to the truth. To deliberately mislead<br />\nthem into thinking things are going well when they are .31ot, to<br />\nlet them believe that certain groups are doing their jobs when they<br />\nare not, to let them feel that the student body are always gentlemen<br />\nwhen they are not, would be an unforgiveable breech of both<br />\nCongressional investigating committees came under severe attack<br />\njournalistic and Hopkins ethical standards.<br />\nThe paper's obligation to its staff \u2022 and to its news sources at the conference on \"Freedom<br />\nand the University\" held Friday<br />\n(considering only the student .officials in this category) is easily and Saturday, February 26 and<br />\nexpressed.

Let us attempt to explain exactly<br />\nwhat the policy of the paper under its current editors has been,<br />\nand what it will continue to be.<br />\nThe aim and policy of the News-Letter's news coverage is the<br />\nsame as that of any reputable paper: to cover happenings in its<br />\ncommunity in an honest and unbiased manner, giving the truth<br />\nwithout distortions unnecessarily injurious to its community.<br />\nWe work to publish the news. We accept with one reservation<br />\nthe definition of news given above. It is admittedly vague, for news<br />\nvaries with readership for any paper or magazine. The reservation<br />\nwe place on the definition is simple: As a publication of a nonprofit educational institution we are obligated to avoid coverage<br />\nwhich will unnecessarily injure the reputation of the university<br />\nor seriously hamper its educational processes.<br />\nThe words \"unnecessarily injure\" need further discussion.<br />\nThe way we can injure the university is by publishing accounts of<br />\nuniversity activities which have hitherto been kept out of the<br />\npublic eye because they were considered to be unrepresentative<br />\nbad publicity. Certain items, if dramatically treated, assume a<br />\nnews value out of proportion to their importance in the University.<br />\nItems of this sort must be underplayed, since whatever the NewsLetter publishes becomes fair game to any interested publication<br />\nor news service in the country.<br />\nThe News-Letter, however, is obligated only to avoid distorting<br />\nthe news by emphasis or fabrication. It is not obligated to cover<br />\n-up for the university or its member organizations, nor is it obligated<br />\nto suppress news. The university, and all its individual organizations, must stand behind their own decisions, right or wrong,<br />\nand take the consequences of their actions, good or bad. They<br />\ncannot escape this by expecting the News-Letter to print only the<br />\nright decisions and the good publicity. To do this would reduce<br />\nthe News-Letter from a journalistic publication to a press agent's<br />\ntip sheet.<br />\nThat is what the News-Letter should not do. Now let us examine the things it should do. Its obligations here are three-fold:<br />\nto its readers, to its news sources, and to its staff. The readers of the<br />\nNows-Letter are entitled to the truth. To deliberately mislead<br />\nthem into thinking things are going well when they are .31ot, to<br />\nlet them believe that certain groups are doing their jobs when they<br />\nare not, to let them feel that the student body are always gentlemen<br />\nwhen they are not, would be an unforgiveable breech of both<br />\nCongressional investigating committees came under severe attack<br />\njournalistic and Hopkins ethical standards.<br />\nThe paper's obligation to its staff \u2022 and to its news sources at the conference on \"Freedom<br />\nand the University\" held Friday<br />\n(considering only the student .officials in this category) is easily and Saturday, February 26 and<br />\nexpressed.
