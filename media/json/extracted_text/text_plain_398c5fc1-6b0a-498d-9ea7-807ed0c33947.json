But beyond that, the purchase sent<br />\nsignals throughout the community that the<br />\nadministration is prepared to listen to and<br />\nact upon student concerns much more<br />\n<br />\nreadily and rapidly than anyone expected.<br />\nMoreover, the purchase showed that<br />\nstudents themselves can do much to affect<br />\nadministrative decisions which are intimately related to student safety and well-being.<br />\nNevertheless, students should not become<br />\ncomplacent on the issue of the security<br />\nescort service. While the new van will undoubtedly relieve some user pressure during \"prime time\" riding hours, the escort<br />\nservice itself will not be expanded, according to campus security officials. As<br />\nbefore, the van service will transport<br />\nstudents only to and from MSE. Movement<br />\nfrom one off-campus location to another<br />\nwill still be prohibited, even with the addition of the new van.<br />\nIn a sense, the University has come only<br />\nhalf way in developing a useful escort<br />\nsystem. The University now has the vans<br />\nnecessary to run an efficient escort service.<br />\nThe next step is to expand the service.<br />\nVan drivers should now be encouraged<br />\nto transport students to and from offcampus locations throughout the University<br />\ncommunity. The only effect of insisting that<br />\nthe service be used for transportation to and<br />\nfrom the library is to discourage students<br />\nfrom travelling safely\u2014exactly what the<br />\nservice shouldn't be doing.<br />\nWe have argued the point before that if<br />\nHopkins can't provide living accomodations for its students on campus, it ought<br />\nto at least provide a safe means for students<br />\nto move about the University community.<br />\nThe University's responsibilities to its<br />\nstudents don't end at the Charles Street<br />\ncurb. On the contrary, the University has<br />\nan obligation to do everything possible to<br />\nprotect its students both on and off campus.<br />\nThe major hurdle of acquiring a new van<br />\nhas now been surmounted thanks to aggressive student pressuring and responsive<br />\nmoves on the part of the administration. It<br />\nwould be a shame to come so far only to<br />\ngive up the drive for expanded service now<br />\nthat the goal seems so close.<br />\n<br />\nA Second Semester Agenda<br />\nLast semester certainly started off as<br />\none of the most tumultuous in recent<br />\nmemory. The din raised by the trial of three<br />\nHopkins shanty bombers, the arrest of fourteen shanty builders, and the delayed power<br />\nboost of WJHU overwhelmed many other<br />\nmore mundane goings-on. As campus attention focused on the dramas unrolling in<br />\nthe first semester, a well scheduled order<br />\nfor dealing with other _issues of concern<br />\nbecame difficult to follow.<br />\nThis semester, however, things have gotten off to a slower and more 'typical' start.<br />\nIn the absence of any overriding scandals<br />\nand controversies, Council finally has the<br />\noccassion to set an agenda of its own<br />\naccord.<br />\nIn so doing, there are a number of issues<br />\nwhich until now have been smoldering over<br />\nthe backburner. As the new year gets<br />\nunderway, Council would do well to include the following issues at the very top<br />\nof its agenda.<br />\n*SAC Seals. Within the next few weeks,<br />\na committee chaired by Richard Pan to in-<br />\n<br />\nvestigate the future of the SAC seals will<br />\nbe making its report. When it does, Council will have the opportunity to provide this<br />\nyear's class and all future graduating classes<br />\nthe service of bagging the SAC seals entirely. No other annual event causes more<br />\nneedless anger and animosity than the seals.<br />\nThe sooner they are clubbed to death, the<br />\nbetter.<br />\n*Social Programming. With the departure of Don Chang from the Social Committee to become Spring Fair Co-Chairman<br />\nand the failure of the HOP to reserve any<br />\nweekend use of the pavillion and the Great<br />\nHall for the semester (with the exception<br />\nof tonight's party), the programming for<br />\nthis semester seems headed for hard times.<br />\nThe Council would do well to assess<br />\nscrupulously where the planning for this<br />\nsemester went wrong and endeavor to rectify it.<br />\n'Security. Council needs to press the administration to expand the shuttle escort service to serve the entire Homewood community, not just late night MSE patrons.<br />\n<br />\nJoe Crook arrives at.<br />\nHomewood. He approaches the<br />\noutside doors of the dorms. They<br />\nare locked. He goes to the main<br />\nentrance of AMR I. A monitor<br />\nseated at a desk eyes him as he<br />\nwalks into the student lounge and<br />\nout again. He waits outside MSE,<br />\nhoping a student will stray from<br />\nthe crowd and attempt to walk<br />\nhome alone.

Joe slithers over to<br />\nGarland lot, where he had once<br />\nplucked batteries from cars like<br />\ngrapes from a vine. The lot is<br />\nalmost completely vacant, and<br />\nthose cars that Joe examines all<br />\nhave hood locks. A passing student spots the shifty Joe and<br />\nmakes a call.

I see no reason to turn<br />\nHomewood into an armed camp,<br />\nbut picture a fortress of eyes,<br />\nears, phones, and intelligence as<br />\n<br />\na desirable objective.

The<br />\nblock to using the CUS better to<br />\nour advantage (the freshman<br />\ngrading policy is a good one, in<br />\nmy view, as is that for incompletes) has been lack of<br />\nknowledge that it exists.

If you cannot wait<br />\nuntil summer for the warmth of<br />\nthe sun, now is the time to send<br />\nyour imagination to Bermuda, a<br />\ncluster of Caribbean islands 600<br />\nmiles off the North Carolina<br />\ncoast.<br />\nFor over half a century, the<br />\nBermuda government has been<br />\nsponsoring Bermuda College<br />\nWeeks during the month of<br />\nMarch. These are week-long programs consisting of complimentary food, dances, aid activities.<br />\nThe tradition dates back to 1933<br />\nwhen students from Princeton and<br />\nother Ivies flew down to<br />\nchallenge Bermuda's rugby team.<br />\nWith a valid college ID, a<br />\nfrazzled student may obtain a<br />\nCollege Week courtesy card\u2014a<br />\nticket to 'party in paradise.' For<br />\nsix days of the week, luncheon is<br />\nserved gratis. Garth Pedro, of the<br />\nBermuda Department of Tourism, assures that the lunch is not<br />\njust a \"hot dog stand,\" but an appetizing buffet. On the beach<br />\nalong with the food, one can find<br />\nmusic, volleyball, sand sculpture<br />\ncontests, the \"Miss College<br />\nQueen\" contest, tug-of-wars as<br />\nwell as good old-fashioned<br />\n<br />\nsunworshipping.<br />\nBermuda is abundant with<br />\nhistory and breathtaking scenery.<br />\nIf volleyball and food become too<br />\nmuch, one can explore the island<br />\nvia bike, ferry, bus, or taxi. The<br />\ngovernment even sponsors a<br />\ncruise to a private island for \"surprise activities.\" The Bermuda<br />\ngovernment's generosity is based<br />\non the hope of return business.<br />\nPedro says that many students are<br />\nso enchanted by the island that<br />\nthey return years later for their<br />\nhoneymoon or anniversary.<br />\nCollege students comprise<br />\nroughly one-third of the visitors<br />\nduring this time, with about 3000<br />\nstudents per week. Several of the<br />\nhotels accept group bookings during College Weeks. To arrange<br />\nfor group discounts, you can contact a local travel agent or call the<br />\nofficial Bermuda travel agency in<br />\nNew York (Aquarius Travel<br />\n(914) 939-2297) or in Boston<br />\n(Viking Travel (617)944-4446).<br />\nIf you are thinking about piling ten people into one hotel room<br />\nFort Lauderale-esque fashion,<br />\nthink again. The Bermuda<br />\ngovernment strictly enforces the<br />\nfour-person per one-unit bedroom<br />\nmaximum. Costs are fairly<br />\nreasonable considering the free<br />\nfood and entertainment (valued at<br />\nabout $190 for the week). The<br />\n<br />\npackage prices range from $469<br />\nto $765 for the eight day, seven<br />\nnight stay including room and airfare. The $469 package gives you<br />\na South shore apartment with a<br />\nkitchenette and daily maid service. If you want to go lavishly,<br />\nthe $765 price lands you at the<br />\nElbow Beach Hotel complete<br />\nwith full breakfast and Gourmet<br />\ndinner served in, of all places, the<br />\nTerrace Dining Room (no relation to JHU). Elbow Beach Hotel<br />\nalso boasts five tennis courts,<br />\n<br />\nnightly entertainment, dances,<br />\nand a heated outdoor pool\u2014all in<br />\naddition to the College Weeks activities. If a group would like to<br />\nfly down to Bermuda and play a<br />\nparticular sport, Redmond<br />\nLacrosse of New York ((212)<br />\n543-9804) arranges sports programs just for this purpose.<br />\nPedro emphasizes the lack of<br />\npoverty and low percentage of<br />\nunemployment enjoyed by the<br />\nCaribbean island. He assures the<br />\nhigh quality of the hotels and<br />\n<br />\ngeneral atmosphere due to the<br />\nhigh standard of living.<br />\nA Baltimore travel agency<br />\nquotes roundtrip airfare prices of<br />\n$309 up to March 31st from<br />\nBWI.

That will produce her<br />\nreaction.\"<br />\nSo says Edward Albee, conducting his Acting, Directing and<br />\nPlaywriting classes at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University as he has<br />\nevery January for the past three<br />\nyear. He is a two-time Pulitzer<br />\nPrize winner\u2014he says three-time;<br />\n\"they forgot\" to give it to him for<br />\nhis 1962 Broadway hit, Who's<br />\nAfraid of Virginia Woolf? His<br />\nstudents are irreverent troupers,<br />\nmost from the Writing Seminars,<br />\nback in Baltimore for the dreary<br />\nseason and this special Intersession program. The classes are actually a single workshop, run daily until eleven p.m., commanded clearly by Albee who sits in<br />\nthe front row or paces right in<br />\nfront of the stage, his blackrimmed glasse,s upon his head.<br />\nThis play, one of six, tells of<br />\na would-be yuppie and his unhappy love life. The rehearsals are in<br />\nan early phase; the actors are not<br />\neven off book. Albee paces. The<br />\nassistant director and author<br />\nperch in the second tier of seats.<br />\nTwo or three times, Albee will<br />\nsay, \"Excuse me,\" and pause to<br />\nmake a suggestion. Tonight he<br />\nassures everyone, \"I'm just<br />\ntesting this attitude. We can<br />\nalways go back and make<br />\nadjustments.\"<br />\n\"The more you lean back, the<br />\nmore secure you are. The more<br />\nyou lean forward, the less secure<br />\nyou are.\" Albee occasionally<br />\nmakes these broad observations.<br />\nAt the end of the session he asks<br />\nthat \"libido\" be looked up in a<br />\ndictionary: he thinks it is pronounced lib-ido.<br />\n\"Woody Allen says li-bido,\"<br />\nvolunteers one of the co-stars.<br />\n<br />\n\"Woody Allen?\" (pause)<br />\n\"Who's Woody Allen?\" Albee<br />\nbreaks in his characteristic smile<br />\nwith this reply, and turns away.<br />\nEvery time he makes a joke, he<br />\nsmiles and turns away.<br />\nSometimes he will just smile,<br />\nalthough his students see this as<br />\njust a mustache machination.<br />\nThe next week, Albee has<br />\nanother pronunciation problem.<br />\nThe word is \"bourgeoisie,\" the<br />\njoke is a mispronunciation and<br />\nAlbee worries that it will be too<br />\nheavy-handed. All this concern<br />\nbrings to mind the boy who<br />\nordered \"bergin and water\" in<br />\nVirginia Woolf<br />\nThey work in the L/V Room,<br />\nplagued by sound problems. The<br />\nhum of fans is a constant; to complain is usually futile. The piano<br />\npractice rooms are nearby. The<br />\nsound booth is soundproof: cues<br />\ncannot be heard. Best of all,<br />\nevery year strange people gather<br />\non performance nights just outside the L/V Room and they<br />\nthrow a loud party, according to<br />\nAlbee. This only happens on performance nights, he says. Those<br />\nfamiliar with theatre at Hopkins<br />\nrecite a long list of complaints,<br />\nbut this year at least new lights<br />\nhave been installed.<br />\nApart from the usual grumbling about certain actors and plays<br />\nbeing chosen, some of the assistant directors find the value of the<br />\nAlbee course dubious. \"Even<br />\nthose I have the title of assistant<br />\ndirector, I'm not the assistant<br />\ndirector, the playwright is,\" says<br />\none, adding \"[the assitant director] has no purpose other than to<br />\nsit around and take notes, and for<br />\nthe performance, show up and<br />\nmove a couch.\"<br />\nAnother agrees, \"every time I<br />\nsay something, he thinks it<br />\ndoesn't agree with what he<br />\nthinks.\" This assistant director<br />\nkeeps at it because \"it looks good<br />\non my resume.\" A third says,<br />\n\"it's not great if you want to be<br />\nin charge of something, but it is<br />\nif you want to learn.\"<br />\n\"That's for the audience. I<br />\nhave to know what she feels. The<br />\nreason we have to know is we<br />\n<br />\nhave to act it. The problem is\u2014if<br />\nEmmy were a first-rate writer and<br />\nhere is the tyro coming to worship at her feet and other places,<br />\nit turns out\u2014but Emmy is a hack.<br />\nI still don't know what I'm directing. I really don't. These are two<br />\nfine actresses. I trust them. .It's<br />\nmy mother I have to seduce this<br />\nstrange lady but she's a hack<br />\nwriter but I don't have high<br />\naspirations mother\u2014it's very<br />\nbewildering.\" Albee is now<br />\nworking on a play about Emmy,<br />\nthe aging author of erotic novels,<br />\nand a student coming to interview<br />\nher\u2014only the student shows up<br />\ntwo days early and doesn't care<br />\nabout the interview.<br />\nThe first night, Albee said it<br />\nwould be fine literally and<br />\nwithout the last five lines. The<br />\nauthor said, \"You can do that,<br />\nbut you can't put my name on it.\"<br />\nThe assistant director says, \"it's<br />\nas if we have two plays, the one<br />\nin the playwright's head and the<br />\none on paper.\" An observer<br />\nnotes, \"the problem is that this is<br />\na very well-written play, but the<br />\nmotivation has just vanished. 1<br />\ncan't imagine how she [the<br />\nplaywright] wrote this without<br />\nknowing the answers.\"<br />\nThey establish that there is a<br />\nseduction of some sort and the<br />\nauthor may be the mother of the<br />\ninterviewer, and the problems<br />\nhave to do with particular lines.<br />\nAlbee says of the author/mother,<br />\n\"in the dictating, she's doing, she<br />\nrefers to his thrusting member<br />\nand then to him as a cockless<br />\nrogue. . .you can't have it both<br />\nways.\" The author defends the<br />\ncharacter's writing as only a<br />\nrough draft and the contradiction<br />\nas important. They compromise<br />\nand decide to keep the lines, but<br />\nemphasize them a bit to bring out<br />\nthe obvious paradox.<br />\n\"I don't want the joke to be the<br />\nauthor's joke. The trouble with<br />\n[Neil] Simon as a humor writer<br />\nis that anybody can say his lines.<br />\nI think all humor should be indigenous to character.\" Albee is<br />\nnow directing a comedy about<br />\nHopkins students, thought sure to<br />\nbe a crowd-pleaser. It's rough go-<br />\n<br />\ning: a character carries two<br />\nRolodexes for a black book and<br />\nrequires girls to apply for dates;<br />\nhe must remove all the materials<br />\nfrom his backpack (the actor is<br />\nsaid to be playing himself). There<br />\nis a near-castration and there will<br />\nbe an inflatable love doll.<br />\nAlbee asks the author,\"What<br />\ndid you do, write a movie script?<br />\nYou've made it almost impossible for people to get off one scene<br />\nand on another.\"<br />\nNeither are the actors spared.<br />\nThe co-star delivers his line,<br />\n\"either Milton or Mike<br />\nNesmith.\"<br />\n\"Try it as 'either Milton. . . or<br />\nMike Nesmith,\" says Albee,<br />\n\"as long as you're not equating<br />\nMilton and Nesmith. See the difference?\"<br />\n\"I don't think so.\"<br />\n\"You will.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, the other co-star<br />\nhas begun eating dinner. \"Are<br />\nyou going to do the whole show<br />\neating?\" asks Albee.<br />\n\"Tonight?\"<br />\n\"Tonight.\" Later,\"I don't<br />\nthink there's much of a point in<br />\nyour sitting for such a short<br />\nscene.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, really.\"<br />\n\"Or eating.\"<br />\n\"Can I eat? I think it puts me<br />\nin character.\"<br />\n\"No. Your diction is bad<br />\nenough already.\" When the plays<br />\nare off book and blocked, Albee<br />\nbegins his campaign for the<br />\nclear delivery of lines. At this<br />\npoint, that is about all he stops<br />\nfor, halting the rehearsal and having actors stop swallowing their<br />\nlines, mumbling or trailing off.<br />\n\"Why can't I hear anything? Am<br />\nI going deafer than ever?\" Albee<br />\ntells the actors to speak up.<br />\n\"Maybe you could hear the<br />\nlines if you weren't a deaf old<br />\nguy,\" says an actor, who heeds<br />\nthe advice nonetheless.<br />\n\"It's more important to reveal<br />\nto the audience about you than to<br />\nhim about you.\" Albee is directing a play focusing on a<br />\nhomosexual dying of AIDS and<br />\nthe person caring for him, also a<br />\nhomosexual, whose lover died of<br />\n<br />\nthe disease. \"Didn't you get it<br />\ntoo?\" It isn't a letter in the mail.<br />\nIt's a death sentence.

There's some pretty<br />\ntitillating stuff here, after all, and<br />\nher vocal talents are really laid<br />\nbare. The single, \"Touch Me (I<br />\nWant Your Body)\" is one of the<br />\nbreast\u2014er, best of the year.<br />\nBut enough sniggering. Sam's<br />\nfamous knockers have not received much exposure in this country,<br />\nwhich means that this comely<br />\nCockney is actually making a<br />\nsplash here on the basis of<br />\nmusical merit. Indeed, many of<br />\nthe tunes on Touch Me are pleasant and catchy enough, but Fox's<br />\nvocals are surprisingly flat and<br />\ncharmless. In the hands of, say,<br />\nSheena Easton, who is endowed<br />\nwith an expressive, sexy soprano,<br />\na mildly appealing bit of radio<br />\nfodder such as \"I'm All You<br />\n<br />\nNeed\" could turn into something<br />\nstunning.<br />\nFox flounders through most of<br />\nTouch Me's ten songs; she sounds<br />\nembarrassingly out of place singing \"Hold On Tight,\" an<br />\nawkward rockabilly number, and<br />\nher macha posturing in \"Wild<br />\nKinda Love\" is simply laughable.<br />\nUnsurprisingly, her most convincing performance is \"He's Got<br />\nSex,\" which requires Sam to<br />\nwhine about her boyfriend's constant sexual demands. After all,<br />\nFox has repeatedly commented to<br />\nthe British press that she finds<br />\nmale genitals, or \"willies,\" as<br />\nthe Brits call them, distinctly<br />\nunappealing. Like most would-be<br />\nsex kittens, Samantha Fox promises much more than she actually delivers.<br />\n<br />\nWe've Got A Fuzzbox and<br />\nWe're Gonna Use It<br />\nBostin' Steve Austin<br />\nVindaloo/WEA import<br />\nMeanwhile, the four women in<br />\nthis British band have made a<br />\n<br />\ncareer out of taking potshots at<br />\nSamantha Fox; their first single,<br />\n\"XX Sex,\" was the best-selling<br />\nindependent-label single in the<br />\nU.K. last year.

But what<br />\nhappens when one loses the ability to do the things which for most<br />\nare reflexive? This is the subject<br />\nof Dr. Oliver Sacks' book The<br />\nMan Who Mistook His Wifefor a<br />\nHat.<br />\nA prominent neurologist, Sacks<br />\nhas compiled case histories from<br />\nhis years in practice and<br />\npresented them in four loose<br />\ncategories: Losses, Excesses,<br />\nTransports, and The World of the<br />\nSimple. And while there are<br />\nsuperficial similarities in the<br />\nneurology of each category, the<br />\nindividual cases show a striking<br />\nrange of dysfunctions and<br />\nmethods of coping with those<br />\ndysfunctions.<br />\nOne such case is that of Mr.<br />\nMacGregor. He suffered from<br />\nParkinson's disease, a condition<br />\nresulting from a deficiency in the<br />\nbrain of the neurological receptor dopamine. Among other funcfions affected by Parkinson's is<br />\nproprioception, the sense of the<br />\nposition of one's body.<br />\nThus affected, Mr. MacGregor<br />\ncould lean to one side of his body<br />\nor the other without noticing the<br />\nincorrect position of his body. He<br />\nwas further affected in that he<br />\ncould perceive no change in the<br />\nposition of some objects relative<br />\nto himself as he leaned. His solution to this problem was to attach<br />\na spirit level to his glasses, which<br />\nhe could consult (eventually unconsciously) to determine<br />\nwhether he was sitting upright.<br />\nSuch pragmatism impressed on<br />\nSacks the notion that patients<br />\ncould and should participate in<br />\ntheir treatment as much as their<br />\ndoctors.<br />\nThere were other situations in<br />\nwhich treatment was a mixed<br />\nblessing. One patient who suffered from Tourette's syndrome,<br />\nthe medical opposite of Parkinson's, was seen by his friends as<br />\nbeing especially spontaneous and<br />\nwitty. These qualities resulted<br />\nfrom the involuntary actions and<br />\nexclamations which the disorder<br />\ncreated. However, the patient<br />\nwas unable to keep a job, also as<br />\na result of his various tics and so<br />\n<br />\nimmiammemmusiamin W h<br />\n<br />\n11110111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111<br />\n<br />\nMISTOOK<br />\nHIS WIFE<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\no<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n111111.11111111111111111111111111111111101111<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nand Other Clinica<br />\n<br />\nhe sought treatment.<br />\nThe drug used to treat this condition did indeed eliminate the<br />\nsymptoms, but it also eliminated<br />\nhis spontaneity and wit and even<br />\nwent so far as to induce the sluggishness associated with Parkinson's disease. But he was able to<br />\nkeep a job and so decided to take<br />\nhis medication during the week<br />\nbut not on weekends when he was<br />\nat leisure to act as he pleased.<br />\nAs is suggested by the title of<br />\nthe book, there is humor to be<br />\nfound in such cases. Indeed,<br />\nhumor is necessary to leaven the<br />\nsadness of loss. A typical example is that of Dr. P., the man implied in the title. He was an extremely talented musician whose<br />\nfailing eyesight and quirky sense<br />\nof humor were initially blamed<br />\nfor what later turned out to be a<br />\nneurological disorder.<br />\nDr. P. was unable to recognize<br />\n<br />\nfaces or to see any object as a<br />\nwhole. He could remember objects based on distinguishing<br />\ncharacterisitics, but could not<br />\notherwise recognize even the<br />\nfaces of his students, whom he<br />\nsaw every day. He did actually<br />\nmistake his wife for his hat and<br />\nwas generally unable to identify<br />\nany object which was not regular<br />\nand symmetrical. All was further<br />\ncomplicated by his inability to<br />\nremember what he was doing for<br />\nthe length of time necessary to<br />\ncomplete a task. A solution to<br />\nthese problems was found in<br />\nmusic. By making each activity<br />\ninto a song, Dr. P. was able to<br />\nmaintain concentration. But if<br />\nanything were to interrupt the<br />\nsong, he would be lost again.<br />\nOther disorders defy humor in<br />\ntheir<br />\npervasiveness<br />\nand<br />\ndebilitating effect. This was the<br />\ncase with Jimmy G., a man suf-<br />\n<br />\nfering from Korsakoffs syndrome, a condition resulting from<br />\nextended, heavy alcoholism. Jimmy had profound retrograde<br />\namnesia, that is, amnesia affecting memory from a fixed point<br />\nonward, but leaving memory<br />\nprior to the starting point<br />\nuntouched.<br />\nIn this case, the amnesia began<br />\nin 1945, and so as far as Jimmy<br />\nG. was concerned, it was still<br />\n1945, the U.S. had just won<br />\nWorld War II, and he was still 19<br />\nyears old and serving in the<br />\nNavy. Occasional jolts to this<br />\nbelief, such as seeing his image,<br />\nthat of a 55 year old man, in a<br />\nmirror, could not jar him from a<br />\nsense of resignation and calm at<br />\nwhich, Sacks marvelled.<br />\nSacks relates that he wondered<br />\naloud to the nurses in the home<br />\nwhere Jimmy G. lived whether<br />\nJimmy had a soul, and was given<br />\n<br />\nan affirmative answer. Sacks<br />\nagreed after seeing that while<br />\nJimmy was unable to remember<br />\nmany tasks from day to day, he<br />\nwas able to command undivided<br />\nconcentration when sitting in<br />\nchurch. Others who had lost all<br />\nability to remember were not<br />\ncounted so lucky, but Sacks<br />\nultimately skirts the issue of what<br />\nmust remain to constitute a whole<br />\nperson.<br />\nSacks is to be commended for<br />\npresenting interesting and entertaining accounts of often<br />\nmisunderstood conditions. There<br />\nis a great need to show that what<br />\nremains is as important as what<br />\nis lost in neurological dysfunction. The book is a compelling<br />\nread, and if increased understanding results, so much the better.<br />\n<br />\n\f18/JANUARY 30, 1987<br />\n<br />\nThe Paper: A Story About Modern<br />\nJournalism and Social Commentary<br />\nby Frank H. Wu<br />\nThe Paper:The Life and Death of<br />\nthe New York Herald Tribune; by<br />\nRichard Kluger; Alfred A.<br />\nKnopt, $24.95; 745 pages.<br />\nThe New York Herald Tribune<br />\nused to have a Sunday book section where major literary figures<br />\nreviewed major literary works,<br />\nand the reviews turned out to be<br />\nmore essays than reviews, according to Richard Kluger, author of<br />\nthe new authoritative study of that<br />\nformer major newspaper, The<br />\nPaper: The Life and Death ofthe<br />\nNew York Herald Tribune. The<br />\nNew Right has fielded the expertise and the money necessary to<br />\nbe a force to be reckoned with.<br />\nIf it had not proved effective in<br />\nthe past and so frightening, their<br />\ncampaign against the press would<br />\nbe laughable. The charge seems<br />\nto go: the press is liberal, distorts<br />\nthe facts and is un-American.<br />\nThe backlash from the<br />\ncoverage of the Iran arms scandal is a watershed case. Pat<br />\nBuchanan, the Nixon apologist,<br />\nhas become a Presidential candidate. Ben Bradlee, editor of The<br />\nWashington Post, is being condemned for his joke. (The scandal being the most fun he's had<br />\nsince Watergate). The nation is<br />\ndivided: is Reagan wrong, or is<br />\nthe Washington press corps filled with un-American and nasty<br />\npeople?<br />\nCertainly the press is a<br />\nmessenger and can only start with<br />\nthe facts. But that does not refute<br />\ncharges of distortion. The press<br />\nis either too arrogant or too meek<br />\nto defend itself. It hides behind<br />\nthe First Amendment, calling out,<br />\n\"freedom of the press\" and<br />\nasserting its right to publish. To<br />\nsome of the New Right, this is<br />\njust confirmation of what they<br />\nhave suspected all along, that<br />\ndamn Bill of Rights is all wrong.<br />\nThe press can serve well as a<br />\nloyal opposition. The best course<br />\nis to calmly declare the press<br />\nAmerican, and proudly so, and<br />\nthen not to hesitate in revealing<br />\nextremists as caricatures of their<br />\nown so-called real Americans.<br />\nThere is nothing less American<br />\nthan smearing someone else as<br />\nun-American. But there is no<br />\npolitical gaffe worse than losing<br />\na debate by failing to respond.<br />\nThe issues are relevant to this<br />\nparticular volume, because its<br />\nsubject served as the loyal opposition for quite awhile\u2014from the<br />\n\"other\" side, as it were. The<br />\nTrib and its Republican influence<br />\nis just one facet of this work. The<br />\nbook contains exactly what its title promises, the story of the New<br />\nYork Herald Tribune.

He does not fault the new<br />\njournalism for its strength, covering events in greater depth,<br />\ngreater humanity and better<br />\nwriting than straight journalism.<br />\nHis own writing is competent,<br />\ntight, and unobstrusive. He also<br />\nprovides insight into the competition between the Trib and The<br />\nNew York Times, showing how<br />\nthe Trib was functioned only<br />\nwhen it took on its own personality instead of copying the Times.<br />\nOf course, everything in the<br />\nworld includes everything in the<br />\nnewspaper business and it's all<br />\npacked in. Kluger seems to love<br />\ntalking about layout, and he.<br />\nwrites well about the different<br />\n\"looks\" of the newspaper and<br />\ngathers all the evidence about the<br />\nsymbolism of the Trib \"dingbat\".<br />\nThe other papers in town make<br />\ncameo appearances, the union is<br />\nin there, alongside a few<br />\nPresidents, literary figures and<br />\nnames which ought not be<br />\nforgotten.<br />\nKluger comes from the<br />\neditorial side of the paper, being<br />\nthe last literary editor, and this<br />\nshows in the writing. Although it<br />\ndoesn't constitute any heinous<br />\nbias, business types are not<br />\ntreated kindly. Certainly judging<br />\nby the proverbial bottom line,<br />\nthey should not be. But Kluger is<br />\n<br />\nis portrayed in this book as a selfpromoter, and worse, he hurts the<br />\npaper by covering up its true<br />\nfinancial situation. According to<br />\nKluger, he \"was whispering<br />\nsweet nothings into Helen Reid's<br />\near.\" As for his actual duties, he<br />\ngets by doing such things as<br />\nordering distributors to inflate the<br />\ncirculation figures. He later<br />\nbecomes president of Coca-Cola.<br />\nCertainly there is something<br />\nredeeming to be said of these<br />\ncharacters or at least there is not<br />\nso much negative to be said. After<br />\nall, the best and brightest of the<br />\nbusiness side tend to do one thing<br />\nin this story: leave. Yet the<br />\nbusiness operations of The New<br />\nYork Times are praised often<br />\nenough, and generally admired.<br />\nIn the end, Kluger takes the<br />\nfailure of the Herald Tribune as<br />\na sign that it was run in a misguided way all along. He is<br />\nforeshadowing. It is tempting to<br />\nbelieve. But when it is all over,<br />\nfor this particular episode of<br />\nhistory, Kluger neither builds the<br />\n<br />\ncase against the management objectively nor strongly enough.<br />\nCompared to the scope of the<br />\nbook, the amazing detail it delves<br />\ninto, and its monumental subject,<br />\nthis is a minor flaw. To hold it<br />\nagainst the entire narrative would<br />\nbe unreasonable. It only bears<br />\nmention as a reminder to those<br />\ntoo-wonderful singsongs of praise<br />\ndished out by those in the<br />\nnewspaper business. After all, it<br />\nis a business.<br />\nAside from that, The Paper:<br />\nThe Life and Death of The New<br />\nYork Herald Tribune is a fine<br />\nbook.

Producer<br />\n\"Myfather had his child when<br />\nhe was sixteen...my mother was<br />\nsixteen. . .so, 1just followed his<br />\nfootsteps.\"Guy, 16 years old.<br />\nFor a city its size, Baltimore<br />\nhas the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the nation. The attitude<br />\nexpressed by Guy, an inner city<br />\nteenager, is unfortunately all too<br />\ncommon these days. Teenage<br />\npregnancy, long considered a<br />\nsocial problem, has been viewed<br />\nonly from the young mother's<br />\nperspective. Last fall, producer<br />\nJohn Kavanaugh set out to approach the problem from a<br />\npreviously ignored perspective\u2014<br />\nthat of the young teenage father.<br />\n\"Teen Dads\u2014The Forgotten<br />\nHalf,\" a WJZ-TV Channel 13<br />\nFor Kids' Sake special<br />\nrepresents the culmination of over<br />\n6 months of John Kavanaugh's<br />\nwork. \"Teen Dads\u2014The Forgotten Half\u2014 profiled four Baltimore<br />\nteenage fathers, documenting<br />\nfamily interaction interspersed<br />\nwith expert commentaries.<br />\n\"This is a street piece, it's<br />\nabout the fathers, not the experts.<br />\nWe wanted to get close enough<br />\nto tell their story, what it is like<br />\nto be in a situation like this,\" explains John Kavanaugh.<br />\nMr. Kavanaugh and his crew<br />\nencountered many difficulties<br />\nwhile trying to conduct interviews. He logged weeks of missed appointments, and even spent<br />\na half-hour on a street corner<br />\narguing with one young man<br />\nabout his reasons for not wanting<br />\nto continue shooting with him.<br />\nThe final product, however,<br />\nwas a moving study of the unique<br />\nproblems and needs of teenage<br />\nfathers. \"Teen Dads\u2014The<br />\nForgotten Half'was critically acclaimed by social service experts<br />\nand the media for striving to<br />\navoid stereotyping the teen father<br />\n<br />\nas irresponsible ana unfeeling.<br />\nThe program accurately presents<br />\nfour very different young couple<br />\nsituations. These four couples<br />\nprovide a stark and intimate look<br />\nat the state of teen pregnancy today and what society must realize<br />\nand act upon.<br />\nMike is an eighteen-year-old<br />\nfrom a working class family who<br />\ngrew up in Baltimore. Mike and<br />\nMichelle, his girlfriend, had<br />\nplanned to marry, but were intending to wait two years. When<br />\na health problem arose that<br />\nprevented Michelle from taking<br />\nbirth control, she became pregnant. Mike's attitude before the<br />\npregnancy was essentially, \"If it<br />\nhappens, it just happens.\" He is<br />\ntypical of many youths that do not<br />\nrealize the economic and emotional responsibility that raising a<br />\nchild entails.<br />\n\"If there was a party to go to,<br />\nwe'd be there,\" stated Mike and<br />\nMichelle.<br />\nThis remark is representative<br />\nof the couple's former ignorance<br />\nabout planning a family.<br />\nHowever, when Mike's girlfriend<br />\nbecame pregnant, the couple was<br />\nforced to start thinking like<br />\nadults.<br />\n\"You're the guy and you're<br />\ngonna want to take care of the<br />\nwoman, want to support the<br />\nchild, and you're only, say, between the ages of sixteen and eighteen. You're gonna grow up in a<br />\nhurry, whether you like it or<br />\nnot,\" said Mike.<br />\nBoth high school dropouts,<br />\nMike and his girlfriend realize<br />\nthat it's going to be hard financially and they are already scrimping and saving for their future.<br />\nMost experts say Mike and his<br />\ngirlfriend are lucky ones, they<br />\nboth are accepting responsibility<br />\nfor their baby, are taking steps to<br />\ninsure future stability to their<br />\n<br />\nrelationships and most importantly to each other.<br />\nTyrell, a seventeen-year-old<br />\nfather living in Baltimore, had a<br />\nchild with his fifteen-year old<br />\ngirlfriend Hilda. unlike Mike and<br />\nMichelle, Tyrell and Hilda are<br />\nnot in love. Yet, Tyrell, like<br />\nMike, accepts responsibility for<br />\nhis actions and takes care of the<br />\ninfant at his home. Tyrell and<br />\nHilda do not forsee marriage as<br />\na solution to their problems, but<br />\nare both working to insure that<br />\nthe baby will be brought up<br />\nproperly.<br />\n\"I really didn't want to have a<br />\nbaby, it's not something I would<br />\ndo on purpose, but it happened<br />\nand I didn't want to abort her,\"<br />\nexplains Tyrell.<br />\nMen in Tyrell's position must<br />\nmake sacrifices seldom seen. The<br />\nfather who does not marry his<br />\ngirlfriend is often discouraged<br />\nand disgruntled, forcing many into depression and lifetime poverty if they decide to stay and help<br />\nout their babies. Herein lies one<br />\nof the most pressing problems of<br />\nteen pregnancy today, that society<br />\nin general, provides very little<br />\neconomic and emotional support<br />\nto teen fathers.<br />\n\"For the most part, they're seeing their babies, they're playing a role in their babies' upbringing, and they know<br />\nnothing. . .and we offer them<br />\nnothing. . . absolutely nothing,\"<br />\ncomplains Rosalie Streett, executive director of Friends of the<br />\nFamily, a public service-oriented<br />\ngroup. \"I don't know of any programs in Maryland that are for<br />\nfathers specifically.\"<br />\nBaltimore has attempted to obtain funding for a counseling<br />\ncenter for young fathers, perhaps<br />\nprovidng services for 60 men, but<br />\nas of yet no center exists.<br />\nInner city groups and many<br />\n<br />\nNew Hearing Center Opened<br />\nNeuroscientists, biomedical<br />\nengineers and otolaryngologists at<br />\nJohns Hopkins' newly established Center for Hearing Sciences<br />\nare jointly investigating how<br />\nhumans hear and process sounds<br />\nin hopes of understanding more<br />\nabout the brain\u2014research that<br />\ncould lead to better ways of<br />\ntreating people with hearing<br />\ndisorders.<br />\n\"When you talk about hearing<br />\nyou're actually talking about the<br />\nbrain, which is still largely unexplored and unknown territory,\"<br />\nnotes Murray Sachs, Ph.D., professor of biomedical engineering<br />\nand the Center's director.<br />\nThe Center is oriented toward<br />\nfundamental research, but Sachs<br />\npossesses a strong ,interest and<br />\nobligation toward involving<br />\nclinical and technological<br />\napplications.<br />\nFor example, studies by<br />\nWilliam Brownell, Ph.D., and<br />\nPaul Manis, Ph.D., of hair cells<br />\nin the inner ear, have shown that<br />\nthe lengths of some cells change<br />\nwhen subjected to electrical currents. \"It's quite likely that this<br />\nmotility is associated with a form<br />\nof tinnitus (ringing in the ears),<br />\n<br />\nwhich now has no medical or<br />\nsurgical therapy other than attempts to mask the annoying<br />\nnoise,\" says Brownell, associate<br />\nprofessor of otolaryngology-head<br />\nand neck surgery. \"Defining an<br />\nactual physical mechanism for<br />\nthese otoacoustic emissions could<br />\nopen the way for drug treatment.\"<br />\nDouglas Mattox, M.D.,<br />\nassociate<br />\nprofessor<br />\nof<br />\notolaryngology-head and neck<br />\nsurgery, is developing a way to<br />\ntest the flexibility of the bones of<br />\nthe middle ear. \"Surgical<br />\nreconstruction of the middle ear<br />\ndoesn't always give the results we<br />\nexpect,\" he explains. \"But the<br />\nability to precisely measure the<br />\nmechanical properties of the<br />\nbones there could lead to improvements in surgical techniques, as well as developments in<br />\nimplantable middle-ear hearing<br />\naids.\"<br />\nStudies by Eric Young, Ph.D.,<br />\nasscoiate professor of biomedical<br />\nengineering, on how certain<br />\ngroups of brain cells function<br />\nwith regard to hearing are fundamental to the development of a<br />\nprosthetic hearing device that<br />\n<br />\ncould be implanted in the brain<br />\nstem for patients unable to benefit<br />\nfrom an inner-ear implant.<br />\nThe investigators at the Center<br />\nhave a wide range of experience<br />\nand backgrounds, and work with<br />\ntwo advisory groups. One, composed of faculty members from<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nSchools of Engineering, Arts and<br />\nSciences, and Public Health, offers fresh viewpoints on research<br />\nand applications. The other, made<br />\nup of outside medical specialists<br />\nand industry representatives, examines the research more closely and acts to maintain contact<br />\nbetween the Center and individuals in technological and<br />\nclinical environments who can<br />\nfind practical applications for the<br />\nresults. They also assist in fundraising. The first meeting of this<br />\nexternal advisory board was held<br />\non Dec. 11.<br />\nSachs notes that he plans to<br />\nraise $8.5 million to recruit new<br />\nfaculty members, as well as to<br />\npurchase and install laboratory<br />\nequipment and a modern computer facility.<br />\n<br />\nTeen fathers have little help from<br />\noptions.<br />\nsocial scientists realize the need<br />\nfor a comprehensive plan to combat teen pregnancy. Today, there<br />\nexist many programs specifically for the teen mother, such as the<br />\nLaurence G. Paquin Jr./Sr. High<br />\nSchool for Expectant Teenage<br />\nMothers, here in Baltimore,<br />\nwhere advice, skills, support<br />\ngroups and education are provided. The problem of teen pregnancy races on, however, and many<br />\nleaders have become vocal about<br />\nsociety's institutions that deal<br />\nwith only half the picture, the<br />\nteen mother.<br />\n\"If we keep going along as if<br />\nthe responsibility is only the<br />\nmother's and we pour money into programs only for the mothers,<br />\nwe're gonna see this problem getworse and worse,\" claims<br />\nRichard Rowe, director of<br />\nHealth and Human Services Division of the Baltimore Urban<br />\nLeague.<br />\nThe most distressing example<br />\nof the teen father portrayed in<br />\n\"Teen Dads\u2014The Forgotten<br />\nHalf'is the father who refuses to<br />\ntake any responsibility for his<br />\nmistake. Guy, 16, has already<br />\nfathered two children while continuing to adhere to the idea that<br />\n\"they just happen.\" Guy feels no<br />\nremorse for having had the<br />\nchildren while still a minor and<br />\nas of yet unmarried. Guy reprsents the nightmarish figure often<br />\nperpetuated in the myths of<br />\nteenage pregnancy.

How about<br />\nyou?<br />\n<br />\nof the season.\" American<br />\nUniversity is a strong competitor<br />\nwhich beat both of Hopkins'<br />\nmen's and women's teams last<br />\nyear and Kennedy believes they<br />\nwill provide similar competition<br />\nthis year. He continued, \"tough<br />\nmatches (such as this) are good<br />\nfor us from the point of view that<br />\nwe swim well; our times are<br />\nusualy better.\"<br />\nMen's Team<br />\nThe men's team, a perennial<br />\npowerhouse in the conference,<br />\nwas 10-4 last year. They won the<br />\nMAC's for the 16th straight year<br />\nand were 6th in the NCAA Division Three tournament. That,<br />\n<br />\ncoach Kennedy's first year, was<br />\nan impressive one; the men's<br />\nteam also broke three school<br />\nrecords. The team, however, lost<br />\nfive of their faster swimmers last<br />\nyear and Kennedy will be relying<br />\non some of the younger talent to<br />\nmeet and possibly better last<br />\nyear's performance. \"How the<br />\nfreshmen mature,\" Kennedy admits, \"should play a key role in<br />\ndetermining the type of season we<br />\nhave.\" One young swimmer that<br />\nKennedy has high hopes for is<br />\nRobert Montgomery out of Germantown Academy. Kennedy is<br />\nalso relying on co-captains Dan<br />\nFritsch and Alan Ravitz to \"lead<br />\n<br />\nthe team -both in and out of the<br />\npool,\" and looking for other<br />\ntalented swimmers such as junior<br />\nIan Brooks to maintain their level<br />\nof performance this season.<br />\nWomen's Team<br />\nThe women's team is in the process of rebuilding, but Kennedy<br />\nhas high hopes. Although the<br />\nteam has not won a conference<br />\nchampionship in the past eight<br />\nyears, Kennedy believes that this<br />\nyoung team may soon become a<br />\nforce in the conference.

Roosevelt Jones<br />\nQuick! Name the men's winter<br />\nvarsity sports here at Hopkins.<br />\nWell, chances are that you correctly identified the basketball,<br />\nwrestling, and swim teams, but<br />\nleft out the men's fencing team!<br />\nAnd that's how the occupants of<br />\nthe fencing room are feeling these<br />\ndays-left out. It seems that Dick<br />\nOles' boys are one of the best<br />\nkept secrets at Hopkins. Their exploits are well known around the<br />\ncountry, but if one were to ask<br />\nyour basic Hoppie about the<br />\nswordsmen, you'd most likely<br />\nreceive the same blank expression<br />\nseen only after adding the wrong<br />\nreagent to a reaction in Orgo Lab.<br />\nThe numbers speak for<br />\nthemselves. The Fencesters, one<br />\nof Hopkins strongest and most<br />\nmasculine teams, have (a) not had<br />\na losing season since 1968; (b)<br />\nhad a 3-year dual meet record of<br />\n60-9, the past three years against<br />\nall opponents;(c) won at least one<br />\nconference individual or team title for 12 of the last 15 years;(d)<br />\nwon the MAC title the last three<br />\nyears; and (e) done all this with<br />\n90% of their men having never<br />\ntouched a sword before coming to<br />\nHopkins. Quoth the fencesters,<br />\n\"We have nothing but admiration<br />\nfor our other sports teams when<br />\nthey do well, but can you imagine<br />\nwhere lacrosse, baseball, swimming, and soccer would be if they<br />\nhad to teach their athletes to<br />\nPLAY the sport first and only<br />\nthen play their games?\"<br />\nOK,so you want to know some<br />\nmore? Here goes. Those crazy<br />\nsword fighters started their season<br />\nwith a strong showing at the<br />\nUSFA Collegiate Nationals, and<br />\nnow have scratched and clawed<br />\ntheir way to a simply scintillating<br />\n10-1 dual meet record, which includes victories over such tough<br />\nopponents as Lafayette, Army,<br />\nand MIT. The only loss occured<br />\nat the hands of Cal State Long<br />\nBeach, where the bout was close<br />\nuntil the end, but one final quick<br />\nthrust by the Beach Boys gained<br />\nsubmission and the Fencesters<br />\nwent down 14-13.<br />\nHopkins has shown delicate<br />\nbalance in all three weapons\u2014foil,<br />\nsabre, and epee. When one<br />\nweapon team goes limp, the other<br />\ntwo are able to pick up the slack.<br />\nLeading the way for the<br />\nundefeated sabre squad is senior<br />\ntri-captain Steve \"the Slasher\"<br />\nForman. The Slasher sports a<br />\nrecord of 16-6 and is paired with<br />\njunior Mark Drasnin (16-5) and<br />\nfreshman Tommy Cantalina<br />\n(15-7). With the help of another<br />\nfreshman, Dave Howe, the sabre<br />\nteam was able to capture 6th place<br />\nat the USFA College Nationals<br />\nagainst some very manly competition. Junior Alvin \"Vidal Sasoon\" Egerer and freshman Andy<br />\n\"the Jabber\" Jablonski have<br />\nmade deep contributions as well.<br />\nIn epee, the weapon most prone for upsets, the team has been<br />\nup and down. Injuries have hit<br />\nhard, with sophomore Mike<br />\nRunge and junior Dale \"Liberty\"<br />\nBell lost to serious, yet<br />\nmysterious, illnesses. Untimely<br />\nankle injuries to senior Jeff<br />\nPoehler and junior Dave \"Gumby\" Lumby have dampened<br />\nspirits as well. Nevertheless, the<br />\nteam has posted a fine (8-3)<br />\n<br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAY CLEANING AND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRING<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nBring in this coupon<br />\n<br />\nwith<br />\n<br />\nyour incoming order and have<br />\n<br />\nThree items dry cleaned for the<br />\nprice of two 1<br />\nexpzu<br />\n.2/ 6 /87<br />\n<br />\nDarth Vacer<br />\n<br />\nDespite'losing eight of last years nine starters, the Musketeers have continued to extend their swords to unprecedented extremes.<br />\nrecord with the aid of sophs Andy Chen, Herb (John De)Tomaso<br />\nand Bob Lee. Coach Dick Oles<br />\nfeels that despite its inexperience,<br />\nthe epee unit could be instrumental in carrying the Blue Jays to a<br />\n4th MAC title in a row.<br />\nThe frivolous foil team has also<br />\nbeen inconsistent throughout the<br />\nseason. The year began in a simply delightful manner, with a 5th<br />\nplace showing at the Nationals,<br />\nwith victories over such toughies<br />\nas UNC, MIT, and the ever<br />\npopular Brandeis. Senior tricaptain Craig \"Wang \u2014 Chun<br />\n(19-8) leads the foilers, with good<br />\nhard support from junior Chai<br />\nKulasakdinun (15-2) and<br />\nsophomores Dave \"Snow\"<br />\nCohen and Jerry Golub. In<br />\nwonderful backup roles, lending<br />\ntheir special talents, are sophs<br />\nPaul \"Mr. Wonderful\" Fox and<br />\nJerome SoIler, and frosh Mike<br />\n\"Putting\" Greenfield.<br />\nThe fencesters still have many<br />\nhard challenges in front of them<br />\nin the coming weeks before they<br />\ncan match last season's sparkling<br />\naccomplishments. This Saturday<br />\n<br />\nthey meet Haverford and Stevens<br />\nTech, bitter conference rivals<br />\nwho always give our swordsmen<br />\na rough time; then on the 14th,<br />\nthe team is at home for the only<br />\ntime this season. They will<br />\nengage in heavy combat with<br />\ntheir most physical conference<br />\nopponenent, Vassar, which after<br />\ngoing coed several years ago,<br />\nhas developed its manly team into a conference power.<br />\nCoach Oles is cautiously optimistic. \"As I said at the start of<br />\nthe year, we don't stand a<br />\nsnowball's chance in hell of keeping the conference title for the<br />\nfourth straight year on paper.<br />\nHowever, with the way these<br />\nguys are working, and the way<br />\nthey continue to improve, it's just<br />\npossible that despite losing eight<br />\nof last year's nine starters, we can<br />\nmake our mark.

Hoopsters Finally Rise<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\nThe 1986-1987 sports season<br />\nhas been a bizarre one. Old champions have fallen to the depths of<br />\ntheir divisions, while new and<br />\nunlikely stars have risen to<br />\ndominance. Just two years ago, if<br />\nyou had told someone that the<br />\nMets would win the World Series<br />\nin 1986, they would have thought<br />\nyou were crazy. If you had gone<br />\nfurther and dared to predict that<br />\nthe Giants would be Super Bowl<br />\nChamps in 1987, most people<br />\nwould have laughed in your face.<br />\nBut if you had gone still further<br />\nand had the audacity to predict<br />\nwhat happened last Tuesday<br />\nnight, you'd have been locked up.<br />\nNo, the New York Rangers<br />\ndidn't win the Stanley Cup,<br />\nalthough that day can't be far off.<br />\nThis was something far more extraordinary, and it took place<br />\nright here at Hopkins. The Johns<br />\nHopkins JV basketball team won<br />\nfor the first time in two seasons,<br />\ndefeating Messiah 83-70.<br />\nThe victory was surprising to<br />\nsome, but the team's play in the<br />\nlast month proved that a victory<br />\nwas inevitable. The offense first<br />\nbegan to gel in a December loss<br />\nto Penn State (York), as Steve<br />\nBlumenthal seemed invincible<br />\nfrom the three-point line and collected 22 points. At Howard<br />\nCommunity College, a second<br />\nhalf rally came up short as the<br />\nBlue Jays lost 77-73. Kevin<br />\nRoller played an excellent game<br />\n<br />\nat point guard, while Matt accomplished some remarkable<br />\nMasemore and Brian Tarver things this season. Patrick Furey,<br />\nsparked the offense with outside for instance, became the first man<br />\nshooting. Stefano Agolina even in NCAA history to play in a<br />\ngot in on the action, as he took game without actually playing in<br />\ntwo shots that caught nothing but the game. With four seconds renet. The next game was even maining against Penn State<br />\ncloser, as Hopkins was nipped in (Ogontz), Pat came in the game<br />\nthe final seconds by Penn State for the first time to attempt a ty(Ogontz) 56-54. This game saw ing three-point shot. Paul Heiss,<br />\nsome outstanding defensive per- however, was fouled as he went<br />\nformances, expecially by Paul after the inbound pass. Coach<br />\nHeiss and Greg Bronshvag. The Johnson then took Furey out of<br />\nfinal loss was to Western the game, thus making basketball<br />\nMaryland by a score of 80-70. history.<br />\nDave Seklir scored 31 points for<br />\nthe Jays, and Jerry Sewak did an<br />\nexcellent job of \"faking\" in a<br />\ndesperation attempt to negate the<br />\nten point deficit as the game came<br />\nto a close.<br />\nNext came the victory. Kevin<br />\nRoller poured in 28 points, and<br />\ntransfer Greg Gold dominated the<br />\nboards. Gold, who also racked up<br />\nabout 20 points, will spend almost<br />\nall of his time in the Varsity<br />\nlineup from now on. The biggest<br />\nfactor in the game, however, was<br />\nthe coaching of Web Johnson.<br />\nCoach Johnson brought back<br />\nmemories of Knute Rockne, as<br />\nhis speech during time-outs<br />\nboth touched and inspired his<br />\nteam. Take, for example, these<br />\nwords spoken to Scott FitzGerald<br />\nduring a timeout at a critical point<br />\nin the second half: \"Fitz, take the<br />\nshot if you're open. We have a lot<br />\nof good rebounders out there.\"<br />\nThe JV team now has a 1-6<br />\nrecord and many individuals have<br />\n<br />\nAfter the game, Pat conquered<br />\nhis exhaustion and said; When<br />\nI came out, I looked up at the<br />\nclock and saw that there were still<br />\nfour seconds left. Officially playing in a game without seeing any<br />\nplaying time has been a dream of<br />\nmine. I'd just like to thank my<br />\nteammates and Coach Johnson<br />\nfor working so hard to help my<br />\ndream come true.\"<br />\nThe JV team travels to Navy<br />\nthis Wednesday to play the Midshipmen's JV. This may seem<br />\nlike a formidable foe, but<br />\n<br />\nHopkins is ready with a new and<br />\nexciting offense. The details of<br />\nthis offense are exremely complicated, but it basically revolves<br />\naround the speed of Danny Kofos<br />\nand the jump-shot of Ion Krop.<br />\nAlso, this Friday in the JHU<br />\ngymnasium, Coach Johnson will<br />\nplay Dr. J in a game of one-onone.

It may, however, have<br />\na bearing on decisions to go on<br />\nto graduate or professional<br />\nschools. . . .

But during Intersession, a sudden decision to purchase a new<br />\nsecurity escort van may have marked the<br />\nbeginning of a new period of<br />\nresponsiveness.<br />\nTo revamp, last semester, the<br />\nHomewood campus was locked in a<br />\nveritable state of siege. For a time, muggings in the vicinity of 30th and Charles were<br />\nreported to be occuring at the rate of at least<br />\none a night.<br />\nDuring the same time, van drivers and<br />\ndispatchers of the University's security<br />\nescort system were enacting more active enforcement of a policy of transporting<br />\nstudents only to and from the MSE Library.<br />\nBecause the van was operating at nearcapacity, they said, allowing van services<br />\nto include transportation throughout the<br />\nHomewood community was impossible.<br />\nStudent controversy ensued. Council<br />\ndebated the issue and pressed for the purchase of a new van. We too called for an<br />\nexpanded escort service.<br />\nBut on October 30, Major Robert Larkin<br />\nof Homewood Security confirmed that the<br />\nLibrary drop-off policy was still in effect<br />\nand added that there were no plans to expand the service anytime soon.<br />\nThen, at a December 12 meeting, Dean<br />\nof Administration Robert Welch, Dean of<br />\nStudents Chris Colombo and Larkin among<br />\nothers, suddenly reversed tack and made<br />\na decision to buy a new twelve-passenger<br />\nvan for the escort service at a price of<br />\n$15,000.<br />\nWe applaud that decision.<br />\nThe purchase of a new van was obviously<br />\nnecessary for maintaining the quality of the<br />\nexisiting overworked security escort service. But beyond that, the purchase sent<br />\nsignals throughout the community that the<br />\nadministration is prepared to listen to and<br />\nact upon student concerns much more<br /><br />\nreadily and rapidly than anyone expected.<br />\nMoreover, the purchase showed that<br />\nstudents themselves can do much to affect<br />\nadministrative decisions which are intimately related to student safety and well-being.<br />\nNevertheless, students should not become<br />\ncomplacent on the issue of the security<br />\nescort service. While the new van will undoubtedly relieve some user pressure during \"prime time\" riding hours, the escort<br />\nservice itself will not be expanded, according to campus security officials. As<br />\nbefore, the van service will transport<br />\nstudents only to and from MSE. Movement<br />\nfrom one off-campus location to another<br />\nwill still be prohibited, even with the addition of the new van.<br />\nIn a sense, the University has come only<br />\nhalf way in developing a useful escort<br />\nsystem.

On the contrary, the University has<br />\nan obligation to do everything possible to<br />\nprotect its students both on and off campus.<br />\nThe major hurdle of acquiring a new van<br />\nhas now been surmounted thanks to aggressive student pressuring and responsive<br />\nmoves on the part of the administration. It<br />\nwould be a shame to come so far only to<br />\ngive up the drive for expanded service now<br />\nthat the goal seems so close.<br /><br />\nA Second Semester Agenda<br />\nLast semester certainly started off as<br />\none of the most tumultuous in recent<br />\nmemory. The din raised by the trial of three<br />\nHopkins shanty bombers, the arrest of fourteen shanty builders, and the delayed power<br />\nboost of WJHU overwhelmed many other<br />\nmore mundane goings-on.

Within the next few weeks,<br />\na committee chaired by Richard Pan to in-<br /><br />\nvestigate the future of the SAC seals will<br />\nbe making its report. When it does, Council will have the opportunity to provide this<br />\nyear's class and all future graduating classes<br />\nthe service of bagging the SAC seals entirely. No other annual event causes more<br />\nneedless anger and animosity than the seals.<br />\nThe sooner they are clubbed to death, the<br />\nbetter.<br />\n*Social Programming. With the departure of Don Chang from the Social Committee to become Spring Fair Co-Chairman<br />\nand the failure of the HOP to reserve any<br />\nweekend use of the pavillion and the Great<br />\nHall for the semester (with the exception<br />\nof tonight's party), the programming for<br />\nthis semester seems headed for hard times.<br />\nThe Council would do well to assess<br />\nscrupulously where the planning for this<br />\nsemester went wrong and endeavor to rectify it.<br />\n'Security.

He waits outside MSE,<br />\nhoping a student will stray from<br />\nthe crowd and attempt to walk<br />\nhome alone.

The lot is<br />\nalmost completely vacant, and<br />\nthose cars that Joe examines all<br />\nhave hood locks. A passing student spots the shifty Joe and<br />\nmakes a call.

If you cannot wait<br />\nuntil summer for the warmth of<br />\nthe sun, now is the time to send<br />\nyour imagination to Bermuda, a<br />\ncluster of Caribbean islands 600<br />\nmiles off the North Carolina<br />\ncoast.<br />\nFor over half a century, the<br />\nBermuda government has been<br />\nsponsoring Bermuda College<br />\nWeeks during the month of<br />\nMarch. These are week-long programs consisting of complimentary food, dances, aid activities.<br />\nThe tradition dates back to 1933<br />\nwhen students from Princeton and<br />\nother Ivies flew down to<br />\nchallenge Bermuda's rugby team.<br />\nWith a valid college ID, a<br />\nfrazzled student may obtain a<br />\nCollege Week courtesy card\u2014a<br />\nticket to 'party in paradise.' For<br />\nsix days of the week, luncheon is<br />\nserved gratis. Garth Pedro, of the<br />\nBermuda Department of Tourism, assures that the lunch is not<br />\njust a \"hot dog stand,\" but an appetizing buffet. On the beach<br />\nalong with the food, one can find<br />\nmusic, volleyball, sand sculpture<br />\ncontests, the \"Miss College<br />\nQueen\" contest, tug-of-wars as<br />\nwell as good old-fashioned<br /><br />\nsunworshipping.<br />\nBermuda is abundant with<br />\nhistory and breathtaking scenery.<br />\nIf volleyball and food become too<br />\nmuch, one can explore the island<br />\nvia bike, ferry, bus, or taxi. The<br />\ngovernment even sponsors a<br />\ncruise to a private island for \"surprise activities.\" The Bermuda<br />\ngovernment's generosity is based<br />\non the hope of return business.<br />\nPedro says that many students are<br />\nso enchanted by the island that<br />\nthey return years later for their<br />\nhoneymoon or anniversary.<br />\nCollege students comprise<br />\nroughly one-third of the visitors<br />\nduring this time, with about 3000<br />\nstudents per week. Several of the<br />\nhotels accept group bookings during College Weeks. To arrange<br />\nfor group discounts, you can contact a local travel agent or call the<br />\nofficial Bermuda travel agency in<br />\nNew York (Aquarius Travel<br />\n(914) 939-2297) or in Boston<br />\n(Viking Travel (617)944-4446).<br />\nIf you are thinking about piling ten people into one hotel room<br />\nFort Lauderale-esque fashion,<br />\nthink again. The Bermuda<br />\ngovernment strictly enforces the<br />\nfour-person per one-unit bedroom<br />\nmaximum. Costs are fairly<br />\nreasonable considering the free<br />\nfood and entertainment (valued at<br />\nabout $190 for the week). The<br /><br />\npackage prices range from $469<br />\nto $765 for the eight day, seven<br />\nnight stay including room and airfare. The $469 package gives you<br />\na South shore apartment with a<br />\nkitchenette and daily maid service. If you want to go lavishly,<br />\nthe $765 price lands you at the<br />\nElbow Beach Hotel complete<br />\nwith full breakfast and Gourmet<br />\ndinner served in, of all places, the<br />\nTerrace Dining Room (no relation to JHU). Elbow Beach Hotel<br />\nalso boasts five tennis courts,<br /><br />\nnightly entertainment, dances,<br />\nand a heated outdoor pool\u2014all in<br />\naddition to the College Weeks activities. If a group would like to<br />\nfly down to Bermuda and play a<br />\nparticular sport, Redmond<br />\nLacrosse of New York ((212)<br />\n543-9804) arranges sports programs just for this purpose.<br />\nPedro emphasizes the lack of<br />\npoverty and low percentage of<br />\nunemployment enjoyed by the<br />\nCaribbean island. He assures the<br />\nhigh quality of the hotels and<br /><br />\ngeneral atmosphere due to the<br />\nhigh standard of living.<br />\nA Baltimore travel agency<br />\nquotes roundtrip airfare prices of<br />\n$309 up to March 31st from<br />\nBWI. Thirty-day advance purchase is not necessary, but space<br />\ngoes fast. The agent urged a<br />\nreservation by the end of January<br />\nto be on the safe side.

The smell of<br />\nscotch with a hangover is just<br />\nterrible. That will produce her<br />\nreaction.\"<br />\nSo says Edward Albee, conducting his Acting, Directing and<br />\nPlaywriting classes at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University as he has<br />\nevery January for the past three<br />\nyear. He is a two-time Pulitzer<br />\nPrize winner\u2014he says three-time;<br />\n\"they forgot\" to give it to him for<br />\nhis 1962 Broadway hit, Who's<br />\nAfraid of Virginia Woolf? His<br />\nstudents are irreverent troupers,<br />\nmost from the Writing Seminars,<br />\nback in Baltimore for the dreary<br />\nseason and this special Intersession program. The classes are actually a single workshop, run daily until eleven p.m., commanded clearly by Albee who sits in<br />\nthe front row or paces right in<br />\nfront of the stage, his blackrimmed glasse,s upon his head.<br />\nThis play, one of six, tells of<br />\na would-be yuppie and his unhappy love life. The rehearsals are in<br />\nan early phase; the actors are not<br />\neven off book. Albee paces. The<br />\nassistant director and author<br />\nperch in the second tier of seats.<br />\nTwo or three times, Albee will<br />\nsay, \"Excuse me,\" and pause to<br />\nmake a suggestion. Tonight he<br />\nassures everyone, \"I'm just<br />\ntesting this attitude. We can<br />\nalways go back and make<br />\nadjustments.\"<br />\n\"The more you lean back, the<br />\nmore secure you are. The more<br />\nyou lean forward, the less secure<br />\nyou are.\" Albee occasionally<br />\nmakes these broad observations.<br />\nAt the end of the session he asks<br />\nthat \"libido\" be looked up in a<br />\ndictionary: he thinks it is pronounced lib-ido.<br />\n\"Woody Allen says li-bido,\"<br />\nvolunteers one of the co-stars.<br /><br />\n\"Woody Allen?\" (pause)<br />\n\"Who's Woody Allen?\" Albee<br />\nbreaks in his characteristic smile<br />\nwith this reply, and turns away.<br />\nEvery time he makes a joke, he<br />\nsmiles and turns away.<br />\nSometimes he will just smile,<br />\nalthough his students see this as<br />\njust a mustache machination.<br />\nThe next week, Albee has<br />\nanother pronunciation problem.<br />\nThe word is \"bourgeoisie,\" the<br />\njoke is a mispronunciation and<br />\nAlbee worries that it will be too<br />\nheavy-handed. All this concern<br />\nbrings to mind the boy who<br />\nordered \"bergin and water\" in<br />\nVirginia Woolf<br />\nThey work in the L/V Room,<br />\nplagued by sound problems. The<br />\nhum of fans is a constant; to complain is usually futile. The piano<br />\npractice rooms are nearby. The<br />\nsound booth is soundproof: cues<br />\ncannot be heard. Best of all,<br />\nevery year strange people gather<br />\non performance nights just outside the L/V Room and they<br />\nthrow a loud party, according to<br />\nAlbee. This only happens on performance nights, he says. Those<br />\nfamiliar with theatre at Hopkins<br />\nrecite a long list of complaints,<br />\nbut this year at least new lights<br />\nhave been installed.<br />\nApart from the usual grumbling about certain actors and plays<br />\nbeing chosen, some of the assistant directors find the value of the<br />\nAlbee course dubious. \"Even<br />\nthose I have the title of assistant<br />\ndirector, I'm not the assistant<br />\ndirector, the playwright is,\" says<br />\none, adding \"[the assitant director] has no purpose other than to<br />\nsit around and take notes, and for<br />\nthe performance, show up and<br />\nmove a couch.\"<br />\nAnother agrees, \"every time I<br />\nsay something, he thinks it<br />\ndoesn't agree with what he<br />\nthinks.\" This assistant director<br />\nkeeps at it because \"it looks good<br />\non my resume.\" A third says,<br />\n\"it's not great if you want to be<br />\nin charge of something, but it is<br />\nif you want to learn.\"<br />\n\"That's for the audience. I<br />\nhave to know what she feels. The<br />\nreason we have to know is we<br /><br />\nhave to act it. The problem is\u2014if<br />\nEmmy were a first-rate writer and<br />\nhere is the tyro coming to worship at her feet and other places,<br />\nit turns out\u2014but Emmy is a hack.<br />\nI still don't know what I'm directing. I really don't. These are two<br />\nfine actresses. I trust them. .It's<br />\nmy mother I have to seduce this<br />\nstrange lady but she's a hack<br />\nwriter but I don't have high<br />\naspirations mother\u2014it's very<br />\nbewildering.\" Albee is now<br />\nworking on a play about Emmy,<br />\nthe aging author of erotic novels,<br />\nand a student coming to interview<br />\nher\u2014only the student shows up<br />\ntwo days early and doesn't care<br />\nabout the interview.<br />\nThe first night, Albee said it<br />\nwould be fine literally and<br />\nwithout the last five lines. The<br />\nauthor said, \"You can do that,<br />\nbut you can't put my name on it.\"<br />\nThe assistant director says, \"it's<br />\nas if we have two plays, the one<br />\nin the playwright's head and the<br />\none on paper.\" An observer<br />\nnotes, \"the problem is that this is<br />\na very well-written play, but the<br />\nmotivation has just vanished. 1<br />\ncan't imagine how she [the<br />\nplaywright] wrote this without<br />\nknowing the answers.\"<br />\nThey establish that there is a<br />\nseduction of some sort and the<br />\nauthor may be the mother of the<br />\ninterviewer, and the problems<br />\nhave to do with particular lines.<br />\nAlbee says of the author/mother,<br />\n\"in the dictating, she's doing, she<br />\nrefers to his thrusting member<br />\nand then to him as a cockless<br />\nrogue. . .you can't have it both<br />\nways.\" The author defends the<br />\ncharacter's writing as only a<br />\nrough draft and the contradiction<br />\nas important. They compromise<br />\nand decide to keep the lines, but<br />\nemphasize them a bit to bring out<br />\nthe obvious paradox.<br />\n\"I don't want the joke to be the<br />\nauthor's joke. The trouble with<br />\n[Neil] Simon as a humor writer<br />\nis that anybody can say his lines.<br />\nI think all humor should be indigenous to character.\" Albee is<br />\nnow directing a comedy about<br />\nHopkins students, thought sure to<br />\nbe a crowd-pleaser. It's rough go-<br /><br />\ning: a character carries two<br />\nRolodexes for a black book and<br />\nrequires girls to apply for dates;<br />\nhe must remove all the materials<br />\nfrom his backpack (the actor is<br />\nsaid to be playing himself). There<br />\nis a near-castration and there will<br />\nbe an inflatable love doll.<br />\nAlbee asks the author,\"What<br />\ndid you do, write a movie script?<br />\nYou've made it almost impossible for people to get off one scene<br />\nand on another.\"<br />\nNeither are the actors spared.<br />\nThe co-star delivers his line,<br />\n\"either Milton or Mike<br />\nNesmith.\"<br />\n\"Try it as 'either Milton. . . or<br />\nMike Nesmith,\" says Albee,<br />\n\"as long as you're not equating<br />\nMilton and Nesmith. See the difference?\"<br />\n\"I don't think so.\"<br />\n\"You will.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, the other co-star<br />\nhas begun eating dinner. \"Are<br />\nyou going to do the whole show<br />\neating?\" asks Albee.<br />\n\"Tonight?\"<br />\n\"Tonight.\" Later,\"I don't<br />\nthink there's much of a point in<br />\nyour sitting for such a short<br />\nscene.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, really.\"<br />\n\"Or eating.\"<br />\n\"Can I eat? I think it puts me<br />\nin character.\"<br />\n\"No. Your diction is bad<br />\nenough already.\" When the plays<br />\nare off book and blocked, Albee<br />\nbegins his campaign for the<br />\nclear delivery of lines. At this<br />\npoint, that is about all he stops<br />\nfor, halting the rehearsal and having actors stop swallowing their<br />\nlines, mumbling or trailing off.<br />\n\"Why can't I hear anything? Am<br />\nI going deafer than ever?\" Albee<br />\ntells the actors to speak up.<br />\n\"Maybe you could hear the<br />\nlines if you weren't a deaf old<br />\nguy,\" says an actor, who heeds<br />\nthe advice nonetheless.<br />\n\"It's more important to reveal<br />\nto the audience about you than to<br />\nhim about you.\" Albee is directing a play focusing on a<br />\nhomosexual dying of AIDS and<br />\nthe person caring for him, also a<br />\nhomosexual, whose lover died of<br /><br />\nthe disease. \"Didn't you get it<br />\ntoo?\" It isn't a letter in the mail.<br />\nIt's a death sentence. If you just<br />\nchange two words: You didn't get<br />\nit too?<br />\nAlbee reminds the actor playing the Alps victim not to wear<br />\nhis wedding ring during the performance.. .the character asks<br />\nhis helper, \"so you took this job<br />\nbecause you were afraid of dying?\" Albee says,' it's not a<br />\nquestion.\"<br />\nThe author tells the helper,<br />\n\"You never say 'I'm not a death<br />\nfreak.\"<br />\nThe actor asks, \"Can I say,<br />\n'I'm not a death freak?\"<br />\n\"I'd rather you not.\"<br />\nAlbee then asks, \"Why\u2014Author,<br />\nwhy?\"<br />\nActor: \"How does it sound?\"<br />\nAuthor: \"Do you like it?\"<br />\nAssistant Director: \"I like it.\"<br />\nThat vote settles it.

There's some pretty<br />\ntitillating stuff here, after all, and<br />\nher vocal talents are really laid<br />\nbare. The single, \"Touch Me (I<br />\nWant Your Body)\" is one of the<br />\nbreast\u2014er, best of the year.<br />\nBut enough sniggering. Sam's<br />\nfamous knockers have not received much exposure in this country,<br />\nwhich means that this comely<br />\nCockney is actually making a<br />\nsplash here on the basis of<br />\nmusical merit. Indeed, many of<br />\nthe tunes on Touch Me are pleasant and catchy enough, but Fox's<br />\nvocals are surprisingly flat and<br />\ncharmless. In the hands of, say,<br />\nSheena Easton, who is endowed<br />\nwith an expressive, sexy soprano,<br />\na mildly appealing bit of radio<br />\nfodder such as \"I'm All You<br /><br />\nNeed\" could turn into something<br />\nstunning.<br />\nFox flounders through most of<br />\nTouch Me's ten songs; she sounds<br />\nembarrassingly out of place singing \"Hold On Tight,\" an<br />\nawkward rockabilly number, and<br />\nher macha posturing in \"Wild<br />\nKinda Love\" is simply laughable.<br />\nUnsurprisingly, her most convincing performance is \"He's Got<br />\nSex,\" which requires Sam to<br />\nwhine about her boyfriend's constant sexual demands. After all,<br />\nFox has repeatedly commented to<br />\nthe British press that she finds<br />\nmale genitals, or \"willies,\" as<br />\nthe Brits call them, distinctly<br />\nunappealing. Like most would-be<br />\nsex kittens, Samantha Fox promises much more than she actually delivers.<br /><br />\nWe've Got A Fuzzbox and<br />\nWe're Gonna Use It<br />\nBostin' Steve Austin<br />\nVindaloo/WEA import<br />\nMeanwhile, the four women in<br />\nthis British band have made a<br /><br />\ncareer out of taking potshots at<br />\nSamantha Fox; their first single,<br />\n\"XX Sex,\" was the best-selling<br />\nindependent-label single in the<br />\nU.K. last year.

But what<br />\nhappens when one loses the ability to do the things which for most<br />\nare reflexive? This is the subject<br />\nof Dr. Oliver Sacks' book The<br />\nMan Who Mistook His Wifefor a<br />\nHat.<br />\nA prominent neurologist, Sacks<br />\nhas compiled case histories from<br />\nhis years in practice and<br />\npresented them in four loose<br />\ncategories: Losses, Excesses,<br />\nTransports, and The World of the<br />\nSimple. And while there are<br />\nsuperficial similarities in the<br />\nneurology of each category, the<br />\nindividual cases show a striking<br />\nrange of dysfunctions and<br />\nmethods of coping with those<br />\ndysfunctions.<br />\nOne such case is that of Mr.<br />\nMacGregor. He suffered from<br />\nParkinson's disease, a condition<br />\nresulting from a deficiency in the<br />\nbrain of the neurological receptor dopamine. Among other funcfions affected by Parkinson's is<br />\nproprioception, the sense of the<br />\nposition of one's body.<br />\nThus affected, Mr. MacGregor<br />\ncould lean to one side of his body<br />\nor the other without noticing the<br />\nincorrect position of his body. He<br />\nwas further affected in that he<br />\ncould perceive no change in the<br />\nposition of some objects relative<br />\nto himself as he leaned. His solution to this problem was to attach<br />\na spirit level to his glasses, which<br />\nhe could consult (eventually unconsciously) to determine<br />\nwhether he was sitting upright.<br />\nSuch pragmatism impressed on<br />\nSacks the notion that patients<br />\ncould and should participate in<br />\ntheir treatment as much as their<br />\ndoctors.<br />\nThere were other situations in<br />\nwhich treatment was a mixed<br />\nblessing. One patient who suffered from Tourette's syndrome,<br />\nthe medical opposite of Parkinson's, was seen by his friends as<br />\nbeing especially spontaneous and<br />\nwitty. These qualities resulted<br />\nfrom the involuntary actions and<br />\nexclamations which the disorder<br />\ncreated. However, the patient<br />\nwas unable to keep a job, also as<br />\na result of his various tics and so<br /><br />\nimmiammemmusiamin W h<br /><br />\n11110111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111<br /><br />\nMISTOOK<br />\nHIS WIFE<br />\nf<br /><br />\no<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\n111111.11111111111111111111111111111111101111<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nand Other Clinica<br /><br />\nhe sought treatment.<br />\nThe drug used to treat this condition did indeed eliminate the<br />\nsymptoms, but it also eliminated<br />\nhis spontaneity and wit and even<br />\nwent so far as to induce the sluggishness associated with Parkinson's disease. But he was able to<br />\nkeep a job and so decided to take<br />\nhis medication during the week<br />\nbut not on weekends when he was<br />\nat leisure to act as he pleased.<br />\nAs is suggested by the title of<br />\nthe book, there is humor to be<br />\nfound in such cases. Indeed,<br />\nhumor is necessary to leaven the<br />\nsadness of loss. A typical example is that of Dr. P., the man implied in the title. He was an extremely talented musician whose<br />\nfailing eyesight and quirky sense<br />\nof humor were initially blamed<br />\nfor what later turned out to be a<br />\nneurological disorder.<br />\nDr. P. was unable to recognize<br /><br />\nfaces or to see any object as a<br />\nwhole. He could remember objects based on distinguishing<br />\ncharacterisitics, but could not<br />\notherwise recognize even the<br />\nfaces of his students, whom he<br />\nsaw every day. He did actually<br />\nmistake his wife for his hat and<br />\nwas generally unable to identify<br />\nany object which was not regular<br />\nand symmetrical. All was further<br />\ncomplicated by his inability to<br />\nremember what he was doing for<br />\nthe length of time necessary to<br />\ncomplete a task. A solution to<br />\nthese problems was found in<br />\nmusic. By making each activity<br />\ninto a song, Dr. P. was able to<br />\nmaintain concentration. But if<br />\nanything were to interrupt the<br />\nsong, he would be lost again.<br />\nOther disorders defy humor in<br />\ntheir<br />\npervasiveness<br />\nand<br />\ndebilitating effect. This was the<br />\ncase with Jimmy G., a man suf-<br /><br />\nfering from Korsakoffs syndrome, a condition resulting from<br />\nextended, heavy alcoholism. Jimmy had profound retrograde<br />\namnesia, that is, amnesia affecting memory from a fixed point<br />\nonward, but leaving memory<br />\nprior to the starting point<br />\nuntouched.<br />\nIn this case, the amnesia began<br />\nin 1945, and so as far as Jimmy<br />\nG. was concerned, it was still<br />\n1945, the U.S. had just won<br />\nWorld War II, and he was still 19<br />\nyears old and serving in the<br />\nNavy. Occasional jolts to this<br />\nbelief, such as seeing his image,<br />\nthat of a 55 year old man, in a<br />\nmirror, could not jar him from a<br />\nsense of resignation and calm at<br />\nwhich, Sacks marvelled.<br />\nSacks relates that he wondered<br />\naloud to the nurses in the home<br />\nwhere Jimmy G. lived whether<br />\nJimmy had a soul, and was given<br /><br />\nan affirmative answer. Sacks<br />\nagreed after seeing that while<br />\nJimmy was unable to remember<br />\nmany tasks from day to day, he<br />\nwas able to command undivided<br />\nconcentration when sitting in<br />\nchurch. Others who had lost all<br />\nability to remember were not<br />\ncounted so lucky, but Sacks<br />\nultimately skirts the issue of what<br />\nmust remain to constitute a whole<br />\nperson.<br />\nSacks is to be commended for<br />\npresenting interesting and entertaining accounts of often<br />\nmisunderstood conditions. There<br />\nis a great need to show that what<br />\nremains is as important as what<br />\nis lost in neurological dysfunction. The book is a compelling<br />\nread, and if increased understanding results, so much the better.<br /><br />\n18/JANUARY 30, 1987<br /><br />\nThe Paper: A Story About Modern<br />\nJournalism and Social Commentary<br />\nby Frank H. Wu<br />\nThe Paper:The Life and Death of<br />\nthe New York Herald Tribune; by<br />\nRichard Kluger; Alfred A.<br />\nKnopt, $24.95; 745 pages.<br />\nThe New York Herald Tribune<br />\nused to have a Sunday book section where major literary figures<br />\nreviewed major literary works,<br />\nand the reviews turned out to be<br />\nmore essays than reviews, according to Richard Kluger, author of<br />\nthe new authoritative study of that<br />\nformer major newspaper, The<br />\nPaper: The Life and Death ofthe<br />\nNew York Herald Tribune. The<br />\nNew Right has fielded the expertise and the money necessary to<br />\nbe a force to be reckoned with.<br />\nIf it had not proved effective in<br />\nthe past and so frightening, their<br />\ncampaign against the press would<br />\nbe laughable. The charge seems<br />\nto go: the press is liberal, distorts<br />\nthe facts and is un-American.<br />\nThe backlash from the<br />\ncoverage of the Iran arms scandal is a watershed case. Pat<br />\nBuchanan, the Nixon apologist,<br />\nhas become a Presidential candidate. Ben Bradlee, editor of The<br />\nWashington Post, is being condemned for his joke. (The scandal being the most fun he's had<br />\nsince Watergate). The nation is<br />\ndivided: is Reagan wrong, or is<br />\nthe Washington press corps filled with un-American and nasty<br />\npeople?<br />\nCertainly the press is a<br />\nmessenger and can only start with<br />\nthe facts. But that does not refute<br />\ncharges of distortion. The press<br />\nis either too arrogant or too meek<br />\nto defend itself. It hides behind<br />\nthe First Amendment, calling out,<br />\n\"freedom of the press\" and<br />\nasserting its right to publish. To<br />\nsome of the New Right, this is<br />\njust confirmation of what they<br />\nhave suspected all along, that<br />\ndamn Bill of Rights is all wrong.<br />\nThe press can serve well as a<br />\nloyal opposition. The best course<br />\nis to calmly declare the press<br />\nAmerican, and proudly so, and<br />\nthen not to hesitate in revealing<br />\nextremists as caricatures of their<br />\nown so-called real Americans.<br />\nThere is nothing less American<br />\nthan smearing someone else as<br />\nun-American. But there is no<br />\npolitical gaffe worse than losing<br />\na debate by failing to respond.<br />\nThe issues are relevant to this<br />\nparticular volume, because its<br />\nsubject served as the loyal opposition for quite awhile\u2014from the<br />\n\"other\" side, as it were. The<br />\nTrib and its Republican influence<br />\nis just one facet of this work. The<br />\nbook contains exactly what its title promises, the story of the New<br />\nYork Herald Tribune. And it contains the whole story, drawing<br />\neverything in the way a black<br />\nhole\u2014or a newspaper\u2014would.<br />\nKluger is at his best<br />\ndemonstrating the power of the<br />\npress. Karl Marx, Walter Lippmann, Red Smith, Jimmy<br />\nBreslin, Tom Wolfe, Art<br />\nBuchwald: all were once Herald<br />\nTribune writers.

He does not fault the new<br />\njournalism for its strength, covering events in greater depth,<br />\ngreater humanity and better<br />\nwriting than straight journalism.<br />\nHis own writing is competent,<br />\ntight, and unobstrusive. He also<br />\nprovides insight into the competition between the Trib and The<br />\nNew York Times, showing how<br />\nthe Trib was functioned only<br />\nwhen it took on its own personality instead of copying the Times.<br />\nOf course, everything in the<br />\nworld includes everything in the<br />\nnewspaper business and it's all<br />\npacked in. Kluger seems to love<br />\ntalking about layout, and he.<br />\nwrites well about the different<br />\n\"looks\" of the newspaper and<br />\ngathers all the evidence about the<br />\nsymbolism of the Trib \"dingbat\".<br />\nThe other papers in town make<br />\ncameo appearances, the union is<br />\nin there, alongside a few<br />\nPresidents, literary figures and<br />\nnames which ought not be<br />\nforgotten.<br />\nKluger comes from the<br />\neditorial side of the paper, being<br />\nthe last literary editor, and this<br />\nshows in the writing. Although it<br />\ndoesn't constitute any heinous<br />\nbias, business types are not<br />\ntreated kindly. Certainly judging<br />\nby the proverbial bottom line,<br />\nthey should not be. But Kluger is<br /><br />\nis portrayed in this book as a selfpromoter, and worse, he hurts the<br />\npaper by covering up its true<br />\nfinancial situation. According to<br />\nKluger, he \"was whispering<br />\nsweet nothings into Helen Reid's<br />\near.\" As for his actual duties, he<br />\ngets by doing such things as<br />\nordering distributors to inflate the<br />\ncirculation figures. He later<br />\nbecomes president of Coca-Cola.<br />\nCertainly there is something<br />\nredeeming to be said of these<br />\ncharacters or at least there is not<br />\nso much negative to be said. After<br />\nall, the best and brightest of the<br />\nbusiness side tend to do one thing<br />\nin this story: leave. Yet the<br />\nbusiness operations of The New<br />\nYork Times are praised often<br />\nenough, and generally admired.<br />\nIn the end, Kluger takes the<br />\nfailure of the Herald Tribune as<br />\na sign that it was run in a misguided way all along. He is<br />\nforeshadowing. It is tempting to<br />\nbelieve. But when it is all over,<br />\nfor this particular episode of<br />\nhistory, Kluger neither builds the<br /><br />\ncase against the management objectively nor strongly enough.<br />\nCompared to the scope of the<br />\nbook, the amazing detail it delves<br />\ninto, and its monumental subject,<br />\nthis is a minor flaw.

Producer<br />\n\"Myfather had his child when<br />\nhe was sixteen...my mother was<br />\nsixteen. . .so, 1just followed his<br />\nfootsteps.\"Guy, 16 years old.<br />\nFor a city its size, Baltimore<br />\nhas the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the nation. The attitude<br />\nexpressed by Guy, an inner city<br />\nteenager, is unfortunately all too<br />\ncommon these days. Teenage<br />\npregnancy, long considered a<br />\nsocial problem, has been viewed<br />\nonly from the young mother's<br />\nperspective. Last fall, producer<br />\nJohn Kavanaugh set out to approach the problem from a<br />\npreviously ignored perspective\u2014<br />\nthat of the young teenage father.<br />\n\"Teen Dads\u2014The Forgotten<br />\nHalf,\" a WJZ-TV Channel 13<br />\nFor Kids' Sake special<br />\nrepresents the culmination of over<br />\n6 months of John Kavanaugh's<br />\nwork. \"Teen Dads\u2014The Forgotten Half\u2014 profiled four Baltimore<br />\nteenage fathers, documenting<br />\nfamily interaction interspersed<br />\nwith expert commentaries.<br />\n\"This is a street piece, it's<br />\nabout the fathers, not the experts.<br />\nWe wanted to get close enough<br />\nto tell their story, what it is like<br />\nto be in a situation like this,\" explains John Kavanaugh.<br />\nMr. Kavanaugh and his crew<br />\nencountered many difficulties<br />\nwhile trying to conduct interviews. He logged weeks of missed appointments, and even spent<br />\na half-hour on a street corner<br />\narguing with one young man<br />\nabout his reasons for not wanting<br />\nto continue shooting with him.<br />\nThe final product, however,<br />\nwas a moving study of the unique<br />\nproblems and needs of teenage<br />\nfathers. \"Teen Dads\u2014The<br />\nForgotten Half'was critically acclaimed by social service experts<br />\nand the media for striving to<br />\navoid stereotyping the teen father<br /><br />\nas irresponsible ana unfeeling.<br />\nThe program accurately presents<br />\nfour very different young couple<br />\nsituations. These four couples<br />\nprovide a stark and intimate look<br />\nat the state of teen pregnancy today and what society must realize<br />\nand act upon.<br />\nMike is an eighteen-year-old<br />\nfrom a working class family who<br />\ngrew up in Baltimore. Mike and<br />\nMichelle, his girlfriend, had<br />\nplanned to marry, but were intending to wait two years. When<br />\na health problem arose that<br />\nprevented Michelle from taking<br />\nbirth control, she became pregnant. Mike's attitude before the<br />\npregnancy was essentially, \"If it<br />\nhappens, it just happens.\" He is<br />\ntypical of many youths that do not<br />\nrealize the economic and emotional responsibility that raising a<br />\nchild entails.<br />\n\"If there was a party to go to,<br />\nwe'd be there,\" stated Mike and<br />\nMichelle.<br />\nThis remark is representative<br />\nof the couple's former ignorance<br />\nabout planning a family.<br />\nHowever, when Mike's girlfriend<br />\nbecame pregnant, the couple was<br />\nforced to start thinking like<br />\nadults.<br />\n\"You're the guy and you're<br />\ngonna want to take care of the<br />\nwoman, want to support the<br />\nchild, and you're only, say, between the ages of sixteen and eighteen. You're gonna grow up in a<br />\nhurry, whether you like it or<br />\nnot,\" said Mike.<br />\nBoth high school dropouts,<br />\nMike and his girlfriend realize<br />\nthat it's going to be hard financially and they are already scrimping and saving for their future.<br />\nMost experts say Mike and his<br />\ngirlfriend are lucky ones, they<br />\nboth are accepting responsibility<br />\nfor their baby, are taking steps to<br />\ninsure future stability to their<br /><br />\nrelationships and most importantly to each other.<br />\nTyrell, a seventeen-year-old<br />\nfather living in Baltimore, had a<br />\nchild with his fifteen-year old<br />\ngirlfriend Hilda. unlike Mike and<br />\nMichelle, Tyrell and Hilda are<br />\nnot in love. Yet, Tyrell, like<br />\nMike, accepts responsibility for<br />\nhis actions and takes care of the<br />\ninfant at his home. Tyrell and<br />\nHilda do not forsee marriage as<br />\na solution to their problems, but<br />\nare both working to insure that<br />\nthe baby will be brought up<br />\nproperly.<br />\n\"I really didn't want to have a<br />\nbaby, it's not something I would<br />\ndo on purpose, but it happened<br />\nand I didn't want to abort her,\"<br />\nexplains Tyrell.<br />\nMen in Tyrell's position must<br />\nmake sacrifices seldom seen. The<br />\nfather who does not marry his<br />\ngirlfriend is often discouraged<br />\nand disgruntled, forcing many into depression and lifetime poverty if they decide to stay and help<br />\nout their babies. Herein lies one<br />\nof the most pressing problems of<br />\nteen pregnancy today, that society<br />\nin general, provides very little<br />\neconomic and emotional support<br />\nto teen fathers.<br />\n\"For the most part, they're seeing their babies, they're playing a role in their babies' upbringing, and they know<br />\nnothing. . .and we offer them<br />\nnothing. . . absolutely nothing,\"<br />\ncomplains Rosalie Streett, executive director of Friends of the<br />\nFamily, a public service-oriented<br />\ngroup. \"I don't know of any programs in Maryland that are for<br />\nfathers specifically.\"<br />\nBaltimore has attempted to obtain funding for a counseling<br />\ncenter for young fathers, perhaps<br />\nprovidng services for 60 men, but<br />\nas of yet no center exists.<br />\nInner city groups and many<br /><br />\nNew Hearing Center Opened<br />\nNeuroscientists, biomedical<br />\nengineers and otolaryngologists at<br />\nJohns Hopkins' newly established Center for Hearing Sciences<br />\nare jointly investigating how<br />\nhumans hear and process sounds<br />\nin hopes of understanding more<br />\nabout the brain\u2014research that<br />\ncould lead to better ways of<br />\ntreating people with hearing<br />\ndisorders.<br />\n\"When you talk about hearing<br />\nyou're actually talking about the<br />\nbrain, which is still largely unexplored and unknown territory,\"<br />\nnotes Murray Sachs, Ph.D., professor of biomedical engineering<br />\nand the Center's director.<br />\nThe Center is oriented toward<br />\nfundamental research, but Sachs<br />\npossesses a strong ,interest and<br />\nobligation toward involving<br />\nclinical and technological<br />\napplications.<br />\nFor example, studies by<br />\nWilliam Brownell, Ph.D., and<br />\nPaul Manis, Ph.D., of hair cells<br />\nin the inner ear, have shown that<br />\nthe lengths of some cells change<br />\nwhen subjected to electrical currents. \"It's quite likely that this<br />\nmotility is associated with a form<br />\nof tinnitus (ringing in the ears),<br /><br />\nwhich now has no medical or<br />\nsurgical therapy other than attempts to mask the annoying<br />\nnoise,\" says Brownell, associate<br />\nprofessor of otolaryngology-head<br />\nand neck surgery. \"Defining an<br />\nactual physical mechanism for<br />\nthese otoacoustic emissions could<br />\nopen the way for drug treatment.\"<br />\nDouglas Mattox, M.D.,<br />\nassociate<br />\nprofessor<br />\nof<br />\notolaryngology-head and neck<br />\nsurgery, is developing a way to<br />\ntest the flexibility of the bones of<br />\nthe middle ear. \"Surgical<br />\nreconstruction of the middle ear<br />\ndoesn't always give the results we<br />\nexpect,\" he explains. \"But the<br />\nability to precisely measure the<br />\nmechanical properties of the<br />\nbones there could lead to improvements in surgical techniques, as well as developments in<br />\nimplantable middle-ear hearing<br />\naids.\"<br />\nStudies by Eric Young, Ph.D.,<br />\nasscoiate professor of biomedical<br />\nengineering, on how certain<br />\ngroups of brain cells function<br />\nwith regard to hearing are fundamental to the development of a<br />\nprosthetic hearing device that<br /><br />\ncould be implanted in the brain<br />\nstem for patients unable to benefit<br />\nfrom an inner-ear implant.<br />\nThe investigators at the Center<br />\nhave a wide range of experience<br />\nand backgrounds, and work with<br />\ntwo advisory groups. One, composed of faculty members from<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nSchools of Engineering, Arts and<br />\nSciences, and Public Health, offers fresh viewpoints on research<br />\nand applications. The other, made<br />\nup of outside medical specialists<br />\nand industry representatives, examines the research more closely and acts to maintain contact<br />\nbetween the Center and individuals in technological and<br />\nclinical environments who can<br />\nfind practical applications for the<br />\nresults. They also assist in fundraising. The first meeting of this<br />\nexternal advisory board was held<br />\non Dec. 11.<br />\nSachs notes that he plans to<br />\nraise $8.5 million to recruit new<br />\nfaculty members, as well as to<br />\npurchase and install laboratory<br />\nequipment and a modern computer facility.<br /><br />\nTeen fathers have little help from<br />\noptions.<br />\nsocial scientists realize the need<br />\nfor a comprehensive plan to combat teen pregnancy. Today, there<br />\nexist many programs specifically for the teen mother, such as the<br />\nLaurence G. Paquin Jr./Sr. High<br />\nSchool for Expectant Teenage<br />\nMothers, here in Baltimore,<br />\nwhere advice, skills, support<br />\ngroups and education are provided. The problem of teen pregnancy races on, however, and many<br />\nleaders have become vocal about<br />\nsociety's institutions that deal<br />\nwith only half the picture, the<br />\nteen mother.<br />\n\"If we keep going along as if<br />\nthe responsibility is only the<br />\nmother's and we pour money into programs only for the mothers,<br />\nwe're gonna see this problem getworse and worse,\" claims<br />\nRichard Rowe, director of<br />\nHealth and Human Services Division of the Baltimore Urban<br />\nLeague.<br />\nThe most distressing example<br />\nof the teen father portrayed in<br />\n\"Teen Dads\u2014The Forgotten<br />\nHalf'is the father who refuses to<br />\ntake any responsibility for his<br />\nmistake. Guy, 16, has already<br />\nfathered two children while continuing to adhere to the idea that<br />\n\"they just happen.\" Guy feels no<br />\nremorse for having had the<br />\nchildren while still a minor and<br />\nas of yet unmarried. Guy reprsents the nightmarish figure often<br />\nperpetuated in the myths of<br />\nteenage pregnancy.

He continued, \"tough<br />\nmatches (such as this) are good<br />\nfor us from the point of view that<br />\nwe swim well; our times are<br />\nusualy better.\"<br />\nMen's Team<br />\nThe men's team, a perennial<br />\npowerhouse in the conference,<br />\nwas 10-4 last year. They won the<br />\nMAC's for the 16th straight year<br />\nand were 6th in the NCAA Division Three tournament. That,<br /><br />\ncoach Kennedy's first year, was<br />\nan impressive one; the men's<br />\nteam also broke three school<br />\nrecords. The team, however, lost<br />\nfive of their faster swimmers last<br />\nyear and Kennedy will be relying<br />\non some of the younger talent to<br />\nmeet and possibly better last<br />\nyear's performance. \"How the<br />\nfreshmen mature,\" Kennedy admits, \"should play a key role in<br />\ndetermining the type of season we<br />\nhave.\" One young swimmer that<br />\nKennedy has high hopes for is<br />\nRobert Montgomery out of Germantown Academy. Kennedy is<br />\nalso relying on co-captains Dan<br />\nFritsch and Alan Ravitz to \"lead<br /><br />\nthe team -both in and out of the<br />\npool,\" and looking for other<br />\ntalented swimmers such as junior<br />\nIan Brooks to maintain their level<br />\nof performance this season.<br />\nWomen's Team<br />\nThe women's team is in the process of rebuilding, but Kennedy<br />\nhas high hopes.

Roosevelt Jones<br />\nQuick! Name the men's winter<br />\nvarsity sports here at Hopkins.<br />\nWell, chances are that you correctly identified the basketball,<br />\nwrestling, and swim teams, but<br />\nleft out the men's fencing team!<br />\nAnd that's how the occupants of<br />\nthe fencing room are feeling these<br />\ndays-left out. It seems that Dick<br />\nOles' boys are one of the best<br />\nkept secrets at Hopkins. Their exploits are well known around the<br />\ncountry, but if one were to ask<br />\nyour basic Hoppie about the<br />\nswordsmen, you'd most likely<br />\nreceive the same blank expression<br />\nseen only after adding the wrong<br />\nreagent to a reaction in Orgo Lab.<br />\nThe numbers speak for<br />\nthemselves. The Fencesters, one<br />\nof Hopkins strongest and most<br />\nmasculine teams, have (a) not had<br />\na losing season since 1968; (b)<br />\nhad a 3-year dual meet record of<br />\n60-9, the past three years against<br />\nall opponents;(c) won at least one<br />\nconference individual or team title for 12 of the last 15 years;(d)<br />\nwon the MAC title the last three<br />\nyears; and (e) done all this with<br />\n90% of their men having never<br />\ntouched a sword before coming to<br />\nHopkins. Quoth the fencesters,<br />\n\"We have nothing but admiration<br />\nfor our other sports teams when<br />\nthey do well, but can you imagine<br />\nwhere lacrosse, baseball, swimming, and soccer would be if they<br />\nhad to teach their athletes to<br />\nPLAY the sport first and only<br />\nthen play their games?\"<br />\nOK,so you want to know some<br />\nmore? Here goes. Those crazy<br />\nsword fighters started their season<br />\nwith a strong showing at the<br />\nUSFA Collegiate Nationals, and<br />\nnow have scratched and clawed<br />\ntheir way to a simply scintillating<br />\n10-1 dual meet record, which includes victories over such tough<br />\nopponents as Lafayette, Army,<br />\nand MIT. The only loss occured<br />\nat the hands of Cal State Long<br />\nBeach, where the bout was close<br />\nuntil the end, but one final quick<br />\nthrust by the Beach Boys gained<br />\nsubmission and the Fencesters<br />\nwent down 14-13.<br />\nHopkins has shown delicate<br />\nbalance in all three weapons\u2014foil,<br />\nsabre, and epee. When one<br />\nweapon team goes limp, the other<br />\ntwo are able to pick up the slack.<br />\nLeading the way for the<br />\nundefeated sabre squad is senior<br />\ntri-captain Steve \"the Slasher\"<br />\nForman. The Slasher sports a<br />\nrecord of 16-6 and is paired with<br />\njunior Mark Drasnin (16-5) and<br />\nfreshman Tommy Cantalina<br />\n(15-7). With the help of another<br />\nfreshman, Dave Howe, the sabre<br />\nteam was able to capture 6th place<br />\nat the USFA College Nationals<br />\nagainst some very manly competition. Junior Alvin \"Vidal Sasoon\" Egerer and freshman Andy<br />\n\"the Jabber\" Jablonski have<br />\nmade deep contributions as well.<br />\nIn epee, the weapon most prone for upsets, the team has been<br />\nup and down. Injuries have hit<br />\nhard, with sophomore Mike<br />\nRunge and junior Dale \"Liberty\"<br />\nBell lost to serious, yet<br />\nmysterious, illnesses. Untimely<br />\nankle injuries to senior Jeff<br />\nPoehler and junior Dave \"Gumby\" Lumby have dampened<br />\nspirits as well. Nevertheless, the<br />\nteam has posted a fine (8-3)<br /><br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAY CLEANING AND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRING<br />\nI<br /><br />\nBring in this coupon<br /><br />\nwith<br /><br />\nyour incoming order and have<br /><br />\nThree items dry cleaned for the<br />\nprice of two 1<br />\nexpzu<br />\n.2/ 6 /87<br /><br />\nDarth Vacer<br /><br />\nDespite'losing eight of last years nine starters, the Musketeers have continued to extend their swords to unprecedented extremes.<br />\nrecord with the aid of sophs Andy Chen, Herb (John De)Tomaso<br />\nand Bob Lee. Coach Dick Oles<br />\nfeels that despite its inexperience,<br />\nthe epee unit could be instrumental in carrying the Blue Jays to a<br />\n4th MAC title in a row.<br />\nThe frivolous foil team has also<br />\nbeen inconsistent throughout the<br />\nseason. The year began in a simply delightful manner, with a 5th<br />\nplace showing at the Nationals,<br />\nwith victories over such toughies<br />\nas UNC, MIT, and the ever<br />\npopular Brandeis. Senior tricaptain Craig \"Wang \u2014 Chun<br />\n(19-8) leads the foilers, with good<br />\nhard support from junior Chai<br />\nKulasakdinun (15-2) and<br />\nsophomores Dave \"Snow\"<br />\nCohen and Jerry Golub. In<br />\nwonderful backup roles, lending<br />\ntheir special talents, are sophs<br />\nPaul \"Mr. Wonderful\" Fox and<br />\nJerome SoIler, and frosh Mike<br />\n\"Putting\" Greenfield.<br />\nThe fencesters still have many<br />\nhard challenges in front of them<br />\nin the coming weeks before they<br />\ncan match last season's sparkling<br />\naccomplishments. This Saturday<br /><br />\nthey meet Haverford and Stevens<br />\nTech, bitter conference rivals<br />\nwho always give our swordsmen<br />\na rough time; then on the 14th,<br />\nthe team is at home for the only<br />\ntime this season. They will<br />\nengage in heavy combat with<br />\ntheir most physical conference<br />\nopponenent, Vassar, which after<br />\ngoing coed several years ago,<br />\nhas developed its manly team into a conference power.<br />\nCoach Oles is cautiously optimistic. \"As I said at the start of<br />\nthe year, we don't stand a<br />\nsnowball's chance in hell of keeping the conference title for the<br />\nfourth straight year on paper.<br />\nHowever, with the way these<br />\nguys are working, and the way<br />\nthey continue to improve, it's just<br />\npossible that despite losing eight<br />\nof last year's nine starters, we can<br />\nmake our mark.

Just two years ago, if<br />\nyou had told someone that the<br />\nMets would win the World Series<br />\nin 1986, they would have thought<br />\nyou were crazy. If you had gone<br />\nfurther and dared to predict that<br />\nthe Giants would be Super Bowl<br />\nChamps in 1987, most people<br />\nwould have laughed in your face.<br />\nBut if you had gone still further<br />\nand had the audacity to predict<br />\nwhat happened last Tuesday<br />\nnight, you'd have been locked up.<br />\nNo, the New York Rangers<br />\ndidn't win the Stanley Cup,<br />\nalthough that day can't be far off.<br />\nThis was something far more extraordinary, and it took place<br />\nright here at Hopkins.

The offense first<br />\nbegan to gel in a December loss<br />\nto Penn State (York), as Steve<br />\nBlumenthal seemed invincible<br />\nfrom the three-point line and collected 22 points. At Howard<br />\nCommunity College, a second<br />\nhalf rally came up short as the<br />\nBlue Jays lost 77-73. Kevin<br />\nRoller played an excellent game<br /><br />\nat point guard, while Matt accomplished some remarkable<br />\nMasemore and Brian Tarver things this season. Patrick Furey,<br />\nsparked the offense with outside for instance, became the first man<br />\nshooting. Stefano Agolina even in NCAA history to play in a<br />\ngot in on the action, as he took game without actually playing in<br />\ntwo shots that caught nothing but the game. With four seconds renet. The next game was even maining against Penn State<br />\ncloser, as Hopkins was nipped in (Ogontz), Pat came in the game<br />\nthe final seconds by Penn State for the first time to attempt a ty(Ogontz) 56-54. This game saw ing three-point shot. Paul Heiss,<br />\nsome outstanding defensive per- however, was fouled as he went<br />\nformances, expecially by Paul after the inbound pass. Coach<br />\nHeiss and Greg Bronshvag. The Johnson then took Furey out of<br />\nfinal loss was to Western the game, thus making basketball<br />\nMaryland by a score of 80-70. history.<br />\nDave Seklir scored 31 points for<br />\nthe Jays, and Jerry Sewak did an<br />\nexcellent job of \"faking\" in a<br />\ndesperation attempt to negate the<br />\nten point deficit as the game came<br />\nto a close.<br />\nNext came the victory. Kevin<br />\nRoller poured in 28 points, and<br />\ntransfer Greg Gold dominated the<br />\nboards. Gold, who also racked up<br />\nabout 20 points, will spend almost<br />\nall of his time in the Varsity<br />\nlineup from now on. The biggest<br />\nfactor in the game, however, was<br />\nthe coaching of Web Johnson.<br />\nCoach Johnson brought back<br />\nmemories of Knute Rockne, as<br />\nhis speech during time-outs<br />\nboth touched and inspired his<br />\nteam. Take, for example, these<br />\nwords spoken to Scott FitzGerald<br />\nduring a timeout at a critical point<br />\nin the second half: \"Fitz, take the<br />\nshot if you're open. We have a lot<br />\nof good rebounders out there.\"<br />\nThe JV team now has a 1-6<br />\nrecord and many individuals have<br /><br />\nAfter the game, Pat conquered<br />\nhis exhaustion and said; When<br />\nI came out, I looked up at the<br />\nclock and saw that there were still<br />\nfour seconds left. Officially playing in a game without seeing any<br />\nplaying time has been a dream of<br />\nmine. I'd just like to thank my<br />\nteammates and Coach Johnson<br />\nfor working so hard to help my<br />\ndream come true.\"<br />\nThe JV team travels to Navy<br />\nthis Wednesday to play the Midshipmen's JV. This may seem<br />\nlike a formidable foe, but<br /><br />\nHopkins is ready with a new and<br />\nexciting offense. The details of<br />\nthis offense are exremely complicated, but it basically revolves<br />\naround the speed of Danny Kofos<br />\nand the jump-shot of Ion Krop.<br />\nAlso, this Friday in the JHU<br />\ngymnasium, Coach Johnson will<br />\nplay Dr. J in a game of one-onone.
