It is simple, though it is doubtless<br />\nhard, to put in practice. The captains, managers and leading spirits of the different teams<br />\nshould try to act in concert with a cordial recognition of the needs of each team in dates of<br />\ngames, in money, and in players. The dates<br />\nof games might be so arranged that the conflict of interests would be reduced to its minimum, while it should be recognized that a<br />\nconflict must exist. There will be money<br />\nenough for moderate demands, if after equal<br />\ndivision of the sum available from locker rents,<br />\nthe individual student interested in athletics<br />\ndoes what is done as a matter of college honor<br />\nby such students in other colleges; if he attends the gymnasium exhibition and takes a<br />\nfriend with him, if he goes to the home games<br />\nand induces others to go, the sum accruing<br />\nfrom these sources will suffice to help the team<br />\nor teams which need more than their share of<br />\nthe locker rent. As regards team membership,<br />\nthere must necessarily be a conflict of interest<br />\nbetween the track and lacrosse teams, as the<br />\nmen qualified for the one are often well qualified for the other; this is the point of inevitable friction and conflict not to be avoided by<br />\nany direction or management. Yet surely no<br />\nHopkins student can wish to see either team<br />\ndropped; we are all proud of both. It is just<br />\nhere, in the choice of new men for the teams,<br />\nin the arrangement of dates so that those who<br />\nare qualified may with the least conflict play on<br />\neach; that a reduction of conflict to its minimum by a co-operation free of recrimination<br />\nand rancor, a co-operation in which every participant should strive to be just and moderate<br />\n<br />\nNo. 11<br />\n<br />\nin his demands, seems to the writer to be the<br />\none thing necessary to keep up the standard of<br />\nour athletics as a whole to what can reasonably be expected, considering the number of<br />\nour student body.<br />\nEDWARD RENOIR:.<br />\nTo The News-Letter<br />\nAs I understand the athletic conditions at<br />\nthe University, the Athletic Association has a<br />\nvery largely increased revenue and is enabled<br />\nto furnish the different teams with relatively<br />\nmuch more financial aid than previously. Notwithstanding this, one of the teams finds its<br />\nappropriation too small to enable it to proceed<br />\nwith its spring programme, as planned, and<br />\nthe advisability is considered of withdrawing<br />\nat least one branch of athletics from the field,<br />\nand of concentrating the remaining funds on<br />\nthe other teams. As the University has gained<br />\na fair amount of so-called prestige \" in the<br />\npast with very limited means, it would seem<br />\nto certainly be in a position, with increased revenues, to continue in the future with reasonable success without eliminating any branch of<br />\nathletics. The object of the Athletic Association is manifestly to promote athletics among<br />\nas many of the students as possible, and not to<br />\nwin athletic prestige for the University. The<br />\nJohns Hopkins has, and it is to be hoped, never<br />\nwill be dependent on this department \"for its<br />\nprestige. A business-like solution of the difficulty seems to be a careful estimate of the<br />\nfunds at the disposal of the Association, a distribution among the various teams in proportion to the members engaged in each, and their<br />\nactual needs, and any team finding its income<br />\ntoo small to proceed on the lines laid out<br />\nshould suit its programme to its means, and if<br />\nthat is impossible, disband, and let the other<br />\nbranches be benefited accordingly.<br />\nW. S. HILLES.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTo the News-Letter:<br />\nI sec by your recent editorial that there is a<br />\nprobability of the track and field team disbanding. This involves, I think, much more than<br />\nleaving the University unrepresented this year.<br />\nWhile not thoroughly familiar with the resources of the Athletic Association, I understand that the present low stage in finances is<br />\nonly temporary, and I know absolutely that<br />\nthey cannot be worse than they were three or<br />\nfour years ago.<br />\nEven then teams struggled through somehow, perhaps not with great success measured<br />\nby victories, but with great credit to the men,<br />\nmanagers, and captains, and members, who<br />\nfought them through.<br />\nRather than let the team go to pieces, would<br />\nit not be better to give up some of the meets<br />\nfor this year, keeping enough fixtures, to hold<br />\nthe men together and in training ? For men<br />\nwho have once taken part in such a meet at the<br />\nbig inter-collegiate, it is not easy to give it up;<br />\nbut there is a larger class who have not yet<br />\ntaken part to be considered. A man is only<br />\nuseful three years\u2014two is far more usual\u2014 in<br />\ncollege athletics; and no standard can be improved or even maintained without a continual<br />\nsupply and development of new material. If<br />\nall competitions are impossible for a year, for<br />\nthat year men will not train\u2014and the consequence is that not only the present, but the<br />\nthree years following will feel the effect. As a<br />\nspecial plea for track and field games: J. H. U.<br />\nhas in them its best chance of successes with<br />\nlarger universities. We never have had, nor is<br />\nit likely, ever shall have enough men to form<br />\nteams which can meet them on an even footing, but there is always a probability of our<br />\nhaving a few first-class men, who can do so on<br />\ntrack or field, where the individual counts so<br />\nmuch more than in teams. There is certainly<br />\nenough of the true sporting feeling around<br />\nJ. II. U. to give up high living this year, provided there is a good chance of feasting the<br />\nyear after. Only next year's feast will likely<br />\nprove indigestible if a course of absolute starvation is followed, till the feast is in sight.<br />\nJAMES SIIALER HODGES.<br />\n<br />\nTo the News-Letter:<br />\nThe present situation of track athletics is<br />\ncertainly a matter of deep regret. The money<br />\navailable for the remainder of the season is so<br />\nclearly inadequate that the sentiment among<br />\nthe members of the team seems to be almost<br />\nunanimously in favors of disbanding.<br />\nThe<br />\ntrack team this year unfortunately has no opportunities of making any money, and must<br />\ndepend entirely on the appropriation of the<br />\nAthletic Association. Such has not always<br />\nbeen the case. The money turned into the<br />\nathletic treasury from the proceeds of the<br />\nFifth Regiment Armory games amounted to a<br />\nlarge sum. The lacrosse and baseball teams<br />\nare amply provided for by the appropriations<br />\nof the Athletic Association and the gate receipts which they will take in.<br />\nIn dividing the money in hand among the<br />\nvarious teams the fact should be taken into<br />\nconsideration that the track team has two seasons in one year, and also that this year it has<br />\nnot a date open for making any money. Each<br />\nteam has its supporters at the Hopkins, and it<br />\nwould be a source of general regret if any had<br />\nto be dropped; but since the amount to be<br />\nappropriated is very limited, it would seem<br />\nthat justice would require that the teams<br />\nshould be assisted according to their records<br />\nin the past year. Some adverse criticism has<br />\narisen because the track team seems unwilling<br />\nto attempt to run the season on the amount appropriated. But it cannot well do otherwise, if<br />\nit is to try to raise or even to maintain last<br />\nyear's standing. The team which carried off<br />\nhonors at Princeton, Georgetown, and championship honors in the State and in Philadelphia, besides tying for sixth place in the American inter-collegiates, has certainly won a position and reputation which cannot be supported<br />\nin a half-hearted fashion. But the most serious obstacle in the way of continuing the<br />\ntrack team is the fact that it will be deprived<br />\nof a coach. A skillful trainer is absolutely<br />\nnecessary, for without such Hopkins could<br />\nnever maintain even her present position.<br />\nGEORGE P. RADCLIFFE.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014ad<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nATHLETIC EXHIBITION.<br />\n<br />\nThe date of the indoor athletic exhibition<br />\nhas been finally fixed as Friday, April 7.<br />\nEverything points to a most successful evening. There is an abundance of good material,<br />\nand interest, in the event is constantly increasing.<br />\nThe University has offered a silver cup as<br />\na prize for the class which scores most points<br />\nin the tug-of-war and on the apparatus. The<br />\ncompetition will be on the horizontal and parallel bars, and on the horse, and in these events<br />\neach .class must enter at least five men, who<br />\nwill be selected from the following list: '99,<br />\nGrimes, Knapp, Ross, Werber, Mullen and<br />\nGuggenheimer ; 1900, Abercrombie, Baetjer,<br />\nMorrison, Routh and Greene, 1901, Noble,<br />\nRiggins, Stephens, Briscoe, Tyler, Dapprich<br />\nand Duck. The members of the winning team<br />\nwill also receive individual prizes\u2014probably<br />\nblack and blue jerseys.<br />\nThe principal event of the exhibition will be<br />\nthe tug-of-war .between two of the three<br />\nclasses, the weakest team being previously<br />\neliminated. Mr. James Hughes, anchor on the<br />\n'92 team, has offered four medals as prizes to<br />\nthe winners. The following men from each<br />\nclass are candidates for their respective teams:<br />\n'99, Lazenby, Haskell, Kurrelmeyer, Taveau,<br />\nRobinson; 1900, W. L. Smith, Francis,<br />\nBeen wkes, Bouchelle, Foster; 1901, Sayler,<br />\nBruton, Constantine, Fishach, Whitman, Riggins.<br />\nThere will be several boxing and wrestling<br />\nmatches, the latter for a medal, offered by Mr.<br />\nWilliam Hilles. The class in broadsword play,<br />\nwhich Professor Zehnter has been training,<br />\nwill make its debut, and Professor Zehnter will<br />\nengage in a broadsword contest with Robert<br />\nGarrett. In the high jump, Scholl, Garrett,<br />\nBaetjer, C. T. Clark and E. J. Griffin are entered, and there will also be a contest in jumping from the spring-board.<br />\nAmong the other prizes which have been<br />\noffered are a pair of exhibition clubs, for Indian club swinging, given by Mr. E. D. Loane,<br />\nJr.; a gold medal for the best all-around ath-<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nlete, given by Mr. James L. McLane; and another medal from Dr. Adams, for the greatest<br />\nincrease in development during the year,<br />\namong the members of the Freshman Class.<br />\nA somewhat novel event which will certainly<br />\nprove a great' success will be a boxing contest, in which the men are to be blindfolded.<br />\nThey will be placed in a sixteen-foot ring, with<br />\nbandage over their eyes, and will box under<br />\nthe Marquis of Queensbury rules. A terrible<br />\nconflict is expected.<br />\n<br />\nTtiE PUBLIC DEBATE.<br />\n<br />\nThe time of the prize debate is fast approaching, and those who hope to speak on<br />\nthat occasion are hard at work.<br />\nThe prospects for an aggressive, spirited debate are even brighter than last year. The<br />\nmen who are to speak on the evening of the<br />\n15th have been finally selected, with the exception of the Junior team. The Seniors will be<br />\nrepresented by George D. Davidson, John C.<br />\nFrench and Morgan L. Chambers, the regular<br />\ndebaters; Philip A. Murkland, L. A. Reymann and T. D. Jones, the alternates.<br />\nThe personnel of the Junior team has not yet<br />\nbeen finally agreed upon. Frederick Foster,<br />\nNorvin R. Lindheim, John P. Hill, D. M. Liddell, Joseph D. Greene and John W. Griffin<br />\nwill make up the team and alternates, though it<br />\nis not yet certain who the actual speakers are<br />\nto be.<br />\nThose from the Freshman Class who will<br />\ncompete for prizes in public speaking have<br />\nbeen divided into two divisions. The speakers<br />\nof the first division are Andrew R. Bird, Norman Boyer, and J. E. Tyler; of the second<br />\ndivision G. Machen, J. S. Briscoe and H.<br />\nByrne. Dr. Adams has not yet decided definitely on the prizes which he will offer, but<br />\nhe will probably substitute books for the<br />\nmedals of last year, in addition to the trophy<br />\nfor which the Seniors and Juniors contest.<br />\nThe musical clubs will play several selections, and the Glee Club will sing.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nCbe ffletuAlitetter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nMARCH II, 1899.<br />\n<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nWILLIAM P.

Most of us are on too good terms with<br />\nthe better part of the College to see any injustice done.<br />\nNow, we think the authorities in the matter<br />\nnever dreamed how their rule charging a nominal fee, and yet a dollar and a half ! would<br />\noperate against the students of the College.<br />\nAnd when the subject is in this way brought<br />\nto their attention, we are confident that they<br />\nwill, and swiftly, make the proper exception.<br />\nOur correspondent has advanced some mighty<br />\nconclusive arguments, but we think the chief<br />\n<br />\nreason the girls should be admitted to our lectures without paying a cent, is, that it is only<br />\na courtesy due from one institution of higher<br />\nlearning to another.<br />\nIN the last NEWS-LETTER an effort was<br />\nmade in the editorial column to state the athletic situation at Hopkins, which suggested the<br />\ndesirability of a full and free discussion of the<br />\nwhole subject, looking to some intelligent decision by the student-body at large. Our columns were opened for this discussion. In this<br />\nnumber appear several letters that have been<br />\nreceived, from Dr. Renouf, chairman of the<br />\nGymnasium Committee of the faculty; Mr. J.<br />\nShaler Hodges, alumnus, who represents the<br />\nAthletic Association in the Maryland Intercollegiate Union; and Mr. W. S. Hilles, alumnus, whose constant interest in our athletics is<br />\ngratefully recognized by everyone. This correspondence, while it far from exhausts the<br />\nsubject, will give impetus to a healthy discussion of the policy we are to pursue.<br />\nThough we continue to refrain from advocating one policy above another, we go this far,<br />\nin suggesting: That while this discussion is<br />\npending all of our teams will accept the appropriations made by the Athletic Association<br />\nwhich in no single case prevents participation<br />\nin a reasonable number of events and that they<br />\nwill make the most creditable showing possible<br />\nin the spring sports. Meantime some decision<br />\nmay be arrived at to apply in the seasons of<br />\n1899-19oo, and to be accepted as our future<br />\npolicy.<br />\nA great deal of the discussion bears on the<br />\nproposed disbandment of the track team. The<br />\nAssociation appropriated $1oo to the team for<br />\nthe spring season. The gymnasium exhibition, if properly supported, should add at least<br />\n$75. With this amount ($175), with plucky<br />\ndetermination on the part of the men, and with<br />\nthe coaching they have already received, there<br />\nwould appear no reason why the track team<br />\nshould not make a good showing, and further<br />\ndevelop the new track material, while a definite policy for all our athletics is being shaped.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nA COURTESY DUE THE WOrlAN'S COLLEUE.<br />\n<br />\nTo the News-Letter:<br />\nI should like to call the attention of the<br />\nproper authorities, through the pages of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, to what seems to me to be an<br />\ninjustice to our fair neighbors, the students of<br />\nthe Woman's College.<br />\nI have heard several of them lamenting the<br />\nnew regulations in regard to the admission of<br />\nthe general public to the various courses of<br />\nlectures given at Hopkins by distinguished<br />\nmen from elsewhere. Their complaint is that<br />\nthey cannot afford to pay $1.50 for a course<br />\nof lectures of which they may only be able to<br />\nattend two or three. As I understand the case,<br />\nthe charge is made chiefly to prevent the disorderly scramble for seats, which was so objectionable last year. If this be the reason for the<br />\ncharge, it seems to me it would be no more<br />\nthan common courtesy to admit the students<br />\nof our sister institution on presentation by each<br />\nof them of a card showing her to be a student<br />\nat the Woman's College.<br />\nIn the Annual Programme of the College,<br />\nin speaking of the \"Advantages of Situation,\"<br />\nthis statement is made : \"The Johns Hopkins University provides courses of lectures<br />\nwhich afford the privilege of hearing the statement of the latest discoveries and conclusions<br />\nfrom the lips of renowned investigators.\"<br />\nShall we not continue to offer them this<br />\nprivilege?<br />\nGRADUATE STUDENT.<br />\nTHE GRADUATES CLUB.<br />\n<br />\nThe project of organizing a graduates' club,<br />\nwhich Dr. Adams suggested at the recent<br />\nalumni dinner, and of which TIIE NEWS-LETTER gave a sketch in its last issue, was discussed at the University Club last Friday night.<br />\nThe matter was intrusted to a committee of six,<br />\nequally divided between the University and<br />\nthe resident alumni.

Morrison,<br />\nand Waldo Newcomer from the alumni.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nIt is proposed to make a selection of fifty<br />\nmen from among the graduate students and<br />\nyounger instructors, and fifty from the alumni,<br />\nand to form the club with these as a nucleus.<br />\nThe membership would then be extended by<br />\nelection, the faculty, alumni and graduate students being eligible. A clubhouse would be<br />\nacquired in the neighborhood of the University, and this would be partially devoted to providing rooms for some of the men from other<br />\ncities, incidentally increasing the revenue of<br />\nthe club by this means.<br />\nConsidering the large body of alumni who<br />\nreside in Baltimore, it seems that such a graduate organization, if carried out along the<br />\nproper lines, cannot fail to be successful, and<br />\nit is certain that an entirely new element would<br />\nbe introduced into the relations of these alumni<br />\nto their alma mater. The usefulness of a graduate club would not be confined to its social<br />\nside merely, but its influence would soon be<br />\nfelt in every sphere of our college and university life.<br />\n,44<br />\nTO LORD KITCHENER.<br />\n<br />\nYou've conquered the greedy Soudan.<br />\nThe murderers of Gordon you've slain.<br />\nStrong of brain, firm of hand, in that parched<br />\nMandist land<br />\nYou've blotted out England's dark stain.<br />\nSteevens called you \"the Soudan machine,\"<br />\nSo powerfully perfect you move;<br />\nAnd the dervishes fear, when your banners<br />\ndraw near<br />\nThe strength of the Sirdar to prove.<br />\nYou've conquered the savage Soudan.<br />\nYou've rivaled the conquerors of yore;<br />\nBut peace you are giving, and civilized living<br />\nTo peoples that lacked them before.<br />\nEngland has made you a lord,<br />\nAnd honored the deeds you have done.<br />\nBut, just-ruling fighter, far wider and brighter<br />\nIs the world's high esteem you have won.<br />\n<br />\nJOHN<br />\n<br />\nPHILIP HILL.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPOINTS ON ATHLETICS.<br />\nIV.\u2014Starting.<br />\n<br />\nIn the sprints,\" or short-distance runs, a<br />\ngood, quick start is of the utmost importance.<br />\nParticularly does this apply to the dashes<br />\nunder 300 yards and to the 44o in relay races.<br />\nNumbers of sprint races are won at the beginning, and defeat is often directly traceable to<br />\na poor, ill-judged start.

It is simple, though it is doubtless<br />\nhard, to put in practice. The captains, managers and leading spirits of the different teams<br />\nshould try to act in concert with a cordial recognition of the needs of each team in dates of<br />\ngames, in money, and in players. The dates<br />\nof games might be so arranged that the conflict of interests would be reduced to its minimum, while it should be recognized that a<br />\nconflict must exist. There will be money<br />\nenough for moderate demands, if after equal<br />\ndivision of the sum available from locker rents,<br />\nthe individual student interested in athletics<br />\ndoes what is done as a matter of college honor<br />\nby such students in other colleges; if he attends the gymnasium exhibition and takes a<br />\nfriend with him, if he goes to the home games<br />\nand induces others to go, the sum accruing<br />\nfrom these sources will suffice to help the team<br />\nor teams which need more than their share of<br />\nthe locker rent. As regards team membership,<br />\nthere must necessarily be a conflict of interest<br />\nbetween the track and lacrosse teams, as the<br />\nmen qualified for the one are often well qualified for the other; this is the point of inevitable friction and conflict not to be avoided by<br />\nany direction or management. Yet surely no<br />\nHopkins student can wish to see either team<br />\ndropped; we are all proud of both. It is just<br />\nhere, in the choice of new men for the teams,<br />\nin the arrangement of dates so that those who<br />\nare qualified may with the least conflict play on<br />\neach; that a reduction of conflict to its minimum by a co-operation free of recrimination<br />\nand rancor, a co-operation in which every participant should strive to be just and moderate<br /><br />\nNo. 11<br /><br />\nin his demands, seems to the writer to be the<br />\none thing necessary to keep up the standard of<br />\nour athletics as a whole to what can reasonably be expected, considering the number of<br />\nour student body.<br />\nEDWARD RENOIR:.<br />\nTo The News-Letter<br />\nAs I understand the athletic conditions at<br />\nthe University, the Athletic Association has a<br />\nvery largely increased revenue and is enabled<br />\nto furnish the different teams with relatively<br />\nmuch more financial aid than previously. Notwithstanding this, one of the teams finds its<br />\nappropriation too small to enable it to proceed<br />\nwith its spring programme, as planned, and<br />\nthe advisability is considered of withdrawing<br />\nat least one branch of athletics from the field,<br />\nand of concentrating the remaining funds on<br />\nthe other teams. As the University has gained<br />\na fair amount of so-called prestige \" in the<br />\npast with very limited means, it would seem<br />\nto certainly be in a position, with increased revenues, to continue in the future with reasonable success without eliminating any branch of<br />\nathletics. The object of the Athletic Association is manifestly to promote athletics among<br />\nas many of the students as possible, and not to<br />\nwin athletic prestige for the University. The<br />\nJohns Hopkins has, and it is to be hoped, never<br />\nwill be dependent on this department \"for its<br />\nprestige. A business-like solution of the difficulty seems to be a careful estimate of the<br />\nfunds at the disposal of the Association, a distribution among the various teams in proportion to the members engaged in each, and their<br />\nactual needs, and any team finding its income<br />\ntoo small to proceed on the lines laid out<br />\nshould suit its programme to its means, and if<br />\nthat is impossible, disband, and let the other<br />\nbranches be benefited accordingly.<br />\nW. S. HILLES.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTo the News-Letter:<br />\nI sec by your recent editorial that there is a<br />\nprobability of the track and field team disbanding. This involves, I think, much more than<br />\nleaving the University unrepresented this year.<br />\nWhile not thoroughly familiar with the resources of the Athletic Association, I understand that the present low stage in finances is<br />\nonly temporary, and I know absolutely that<br />\nthey cannot be worse than they were three or<br />\nfour years ago.<br />\nEven then teams struggled through somehow, perhaps not with great success measured<br />\nby victories, but with great credit to the men,<br />\nmanagers, and captains, and members, who<br />\nfought them through.<br />\nRather than let the team go to pieces, would<br />\nit not be better to give up some of the meets<br />\nfor this year, keeping enough fixtures, to hold<br />\nthe men together and in training ? For men<br />\nwho have once taken part in such a meet at the<br />\nbig inter-collegiate, it is not easy to give it up;<br />\nbut there is a larger class who have not yet<br />\ntaken part to be considered. A man is only<br />\nuseful three years\u2014two is far more usual\u2014 in<br />\ncollege athletics; and no standard can be improved or even maintained without a continual<br />\nsupply and development of new material. If<br />\nall competitions are impossible for a year, for<br />\nthat year men will not train\u2014and the consequence is that not only the present, but the<br />\nthree years following will feel the effect. As a<br />\nspecial plea for track and field games: J. H. U.<br />\nhas in them its best chance of successes with<br />\nlarger universities. We never have had, nor is<br />\nit likely, ever shall have enough men to form<br />\nteams which can meet them on an even footing, but there is always a probability of our<br />\nhaving a few first-class men, who can do so on<br />\ntrack or field, where the individual counts so<br />\nmuch more than in teams. There is certainly<br />\nenough of the true sporting feeling around<br />\nJ. II. U. to give up high living this year, provided there is a good chance of feasting the<br />\nyear after. Only next year's feast will likely<br />\nprove indigestible if a course of absolute starvation is followed, till the feast is in sight.<br />\nJAMES SIIALER HODGES.<br /><br />\nTo the News-Letter:<br />\nThe present situation of track athletics is<br />\ncertainly a matter of deep regret. The money<br />\navailable for the remainder of the season is so<br />\nclearly inadequate that the sentiment among<br />\nthe members of the team seems to be almost<br />\nunanimously in favors of disbanding.<br />\nThe<br />\ntrack team this year unfortunately has no opportunities of making any money, and must<br />\ndepend entirely on the appropriation of the<br />\nAthletic Association. Such has not always<br />\nbeen the case. The money turned into the<br />\nathletic treasury from the proceeds of the<br />\nFifth Regiment Armory games amounted to a<br />\nlarge sum. The lacrosse and baseball teams<br />\nare amply provided for by the appropriations<br />\nof the Athletic Association and the gate receipts which they will take in.<br />\nIn dividing the money in hand among the<br />\nvarious teams the fact should be taken into<br />\nconsideration that the track team has two seasons in one year, and also that this year it has<br />\nnot a date open for making any money. Each<br />\nteam has its supporters at the Hopkins, and it<br />\nwould be a source of general regret if any had<br />\nto be dropped; but since the amount to be<br />\nappropriated is very limited, it would seem<br />\nthat justice would require that the teams<br />\nshould be assisted according to their records<br />\nin the past year. Some adverse criticism has<br />\narisen because the track team seems unwilling<br />\nto attempt to run the season on the amount appropriated. But it cannot well do otherwise, if<br />\nit is to try to raise or even to maintain last<br />\nyear's standing. The team which carried off<br />\nhonors at Princeton, Georgetown, and championship honors in the State and in Philadelphia, besides tying for sixth place in the American inter-collegiates, has certainly won a position and reputation which cannot be supported<br />\nin a half-hearted fashion. But the most serious obstacle in the way of continuing the<br />\ntrack team is the fact that it will be deprived<br />\nof a coach. A skillful trainer is absolutely<br />\nnecessary, for without such Hopkins could<br />\nnever maintain even her present position.<br />\nGEORGE P. RADCLIFFE.<br /><br />\n\u2014ad<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nATHLETIC EXHIBITION.<br /><br />\nThe date of the indoor athletic exhibition<br />\nhas been finally fixed as Friday, April 7.<br />\nEverything points to a most successful evening. There is an abundance of good material,<br />\nand interest, in the event is constantly increasing.<br />\nThe University has offered a silver cup as<br />\na prize for the class which scores most points<br />\nin the tug-of-war and on the apparatus. The<br />\ncompetition will be on the horizontal and parallel bars, and on the horse, and in these events<br />\neach .class must enter at least five men, who<br />\nwill be selected from the following list: '99,<br />\nGrimes, Knapp, Ross, Werber, Mullen and<br />\nGuggenheimer ; 1900, Abercrombie, Baetjer,<br />\nMorrison, Routh and Greene, 1901, Noble,<br />\nRiggins, Stephens, Briscoe, Tyler, Dapprich<br />\nand Duck. The members of the winning team<br />\nwill also receive individual prizes\u2014probably<br />\nblack and blue jerseys.<br />\nThe principal event of the exhibition will be<br />\nthe tug-of-war .between two of the three<br />\nclasses, the weakest team being previously<br />\neliminated. Mr. James Hughes, anchor on the<br />\n'92 team, has offered four medals as prizes to<br />\nthe winners. The following men from each<br />\nclass are candidates for their respective teams:<br />\n'99, Lazenby, Haskell, Kurrelmeyer, Taveau,<br />\nRobinson; 1900, W. L. Smith, Francis,<br />\nBeen wkes, Bouchelle, Foster; 1901, Sayler,<br />\nBruton, Constantine, Fishach, Whitman, Riggins.<br />\nThere will be several boxing and wrestling<br />\nmatches, the latter for a medal, offered by Mr.<br />\nWilliam Hilles. The class in broadsword play,<br />\nwhich Professor Zehnter has been training,<br />\nwill make its debut, and Professor Zehnter will<br />\nengage in a broadsword contest with Robert<br />\nGarrett. In the high jump, Scholl, Garrett,<br />\nBaetjer, C. T. Clark and E. J. Griffin are entered, and there will also be a contest in jumping from the spring-board.<br />\nAmong the other prizes which have been<br />\noffered are a pair of exhibition clubs, for Indian club swinging, given by Mr. E. D. Loane,<br />\nJr.; a gold medal for the best all-around ath-<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nlete, given by Mr. James L. McLane; and another medal from Dr. Adams, for the greatest<br />\nincrease in development during the year,<br />\namong the members of the Freshman Class.<br />\nA somewhat novel event which will certainly<br />\nprove a great' success will be a boxing contest, in which the men are to be blindfolded.<br />\nThey will be placed in a sixteen-foot ring, with<br />\nbandage over their eyes, and will box under<br />\nthe Marquis of Queensbury rules. A terrible<br />\nconflict is expected.<br /><br />\nTtiE PUBLIC DEBATE.<br /><br />\nThe time of the prize debate is fast approaching, and those who hope to speak on<br />\nthat occasion are hard at work.<br />\nThe prospects for an aggressive, spirited debate are even brighter than last year. The<br />\nmen who are to speak on the evening of the<br />\n15th have been finally selected, with the exception of the Junior team. The Seniors will be<br />\nrepresented by George D. Davidson, John C.<br />\nFrench and Morgan L. Chambers, the regular<br />\ndebaters; Philip A. Murkland, L. A. Reymann and T. D. Jones, the alternates.<br />\nThe personnel of the Junior team has not yet<br />\nbeen finally agreed upon. Frederick Foster,<br />\nNorvin R. Lindheim, John P. Hill, D. M. Liddell, Joseph D. Greene and John W. Griffin<br />\nwill make up the team and alternates, though it<br />\nis not yet certain who the actual speakers are<br />\nto be.<br />\nThose from the Freshman Class who will<br />\ncompete for prizes in public speaking have<br />\nbeen divided into two divisions. The speakers<br />\nof the first division are Andrew R. Bird, Norman Boyer, and J. E. Tyler; of the second<br />\ndivision G. Machen, J. S. Briscoe and H.<br />\nByrne. Dr. Adams has not yet decided definitely on the prizes which he will offer, but<br />\nhe will probably substitute books for the<br />\nmedals of last year, in addition to the trophy<br />\nfor which the Seniors and Juniors contest.<br />\nThe musical clubs will play several selections, and the Glee Club will sing.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nCbe ffletuAlitetter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\nMARCH II, 1899.<br /><br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nWILLIAM P.

Our columns were opened for this discussion. In this<br />\nnumber appear several letters that have been<br />\nreceived, from Dr. Renouf, chairman of the<br />\nGymnasium Committee of the faculty; Mr. J.<br />\nShaler Hodges, alumnus, who represents the<br />\nAthletic Association in the Maryland Intercollegiate Union; and Mr. W. S. Hilles, alumnus, whose constant interest in our athletics is<br />\ngratefully recognized by everyone. This correspondence, while it far from exhausts the<br />\nsubject, will give impetus to a healthy discussion of the policy we are to pursue.<br />\nThough we continue to refrain from advocating one policy above another, we go this far,<br />\nin suggesting: That while this discussion is<br />\npending all of our teams will accept the appropriations made by the Athletic Association<br />\nwhich in no single case prevents participation<br />\nin a reasonable number of events and that they<br />\nwill make the most creditable showing possible<br />\nin the spring sports. Meantime some decision<br />\nmay be arrived at to apply in the seasons of<br />\n1899-19oo, and to be accepted as our future<br />\npolicy.<br />\nA great deal of the discussion bears on the<br />\nproposed disbandment of the track team. The<br />\nAssociation appropriated $1oo to the team for<br />\nthe spring season. The gymnasium exhibition, if properly supported, should add at least<br />\n$75. With this amount ($175), with plucky<br />\ndetermination on the part of the men, and with<br />\nthe coaching they have already received, there<br />\nwould appear no reason why the track team<br />\nshould not make a good showing, and further<br />\ndevelop the new track material, while a definite policy for all our athletics is being shaped.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nA COURTESY DUE THE WOrlAN'S COLLEUE.<br /><br />\nTo the News-Letter:<br />\nI should like to call the attention of the<br />\nproper authorities, through the pages of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, to what seems to me to be an<br />\ninjustice to our fair neighbors, the students of<br />\nthe Woman's College.<br />\nI have heard several of them lamenting the<br />\nnew regulations in regard to the admission of<br />\nthe general public to the various courses of<br />\nlectures given at Hopkins by distinguished<br />\nmen from elsewhere. Their complaint is that<br />\nthey cannot afford to pay $1.50 for a course<br />\nof lectures of which they may only be able to<br />\nattend two or three. As I understand the case,<br />\nthe charge is made chiefly to prevent the disorderly scramble for seats, which was so objectionable last year. If this be the reason for the<br />\ncharge, it seems to me it would be no more<br />\nthan common courtesy to admit the students<br />\nof our sister institution on presentation by each<br />\nof them of a card showing her to be a student<br />\nat the Woman's College.<br />\nIn the Annual Programme of the College,<br />\nin speaking of the \"Advantages of Situation,\"<br />\nthis statement is made : \"The Johns Hopkins University provides courses of lectures<br />\nwhich afford the privilege of hearing the statement of the latest discoveries and conclusions<br />\nfrom the lips of renowned investigators.\"<br />\nShall we not continue to offer them this<br />\nprivilege?<br />\nGRADUATE STUDENT.<br />\nTHE GRADUATES CLUB.<br /><br />\nThe project of organizing a graduates' club,<br />\nwhich Dr. Adams suggested at the recent<br />\nalumni dinner, and of which TIIE NEWS-LETTER gave a sketch in its last issue, was discussed at the University Club last Friday night.<br />\nThe matter was intrusted to a committee of six,<br />\nequally divided between the University and<br />\nthe resident alumni. This committee consists<br />\nof Dr. Hollander, with Messrs. Vincent Renouf<br />\nand Robert Garrett, from the University, and<br />\nMessrs. A. J. Shriver, George C. Morrison,<br />\nand Waldo Newcomer from the alumni.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nIt is proposed to make a selection of fifty<br />\nmen from among the graduate students and<br />\nyounger instructors, and fifty from the alumni,<br />\nand to form the club with these as a nucleus.<br />\nThe membership would then be extended by<br />\nelection, the faculty, alumni and graduate students being eligible. A clubhouse would be<br />\nacquired in the neighborhood of the University, and this would be partially devoted to providing rooms for some of the men from other<br />\ncities, incidentally increasing the revenue of<br />\nthe club by this means.<br />\nConsidering the large body of alumni who<br />\nreside in Baltimore, it seems that such a graduate organization, if carried out along the<br />\nproper lines, cannot fail to be successful, and<br />\nit is certain that an entirely new element would<br />\nbe introduced into the relations of these alumni<br />\nto their alma mater. The usefulness of a graduate club would not be confined to its social<br />\nside merely, but its influence would soon be<br />\nfelt in every sphere of our college and university life.<br />\n,44<br />\nTO LORD KITCHENER.<br /><br />\nYou've conquered the greedy Soudan.<br />\nThe murderers of Gordon you've slain.<br />\nStrong of brain, firm of hand, in that parched<br />\nMandist land<br />\nYou've blotted out England's dark stain.<br />\nSteevens called you \"the Soudan machine,\"<br />\nSo powerfully perfect you move;<br />\nAnd the dervishes fear, when your banners<br />\ndraw near<br />\nThe strength of the Sirdar to prove.<br />\nYou've conquered the savage Soudan.<br />\nYou've rivaled the conquerors of yore;<br />\nBut peace you are giving, and civilized living<br />\nTo peoples that lacked them before.<br />\nEngland has made you a lord,<br />\nAnd honored the deeds you have done.<br />\nBut, just-ruling fighter, far wider and brighter<br />\nIs the world's high esteem you have won.<br /><br />\nJOHN<br /><br />\nPHILIP HILL.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPOINTS ON ATHLETICS.<br />\nIV.\u2014Starting.<br /><br />\nIn the sprints,\" or short-distance runs, a<br />\ngood, quick start is of the utmost importance.<br />\nParticularly does this apply to the dashes<br />\nunder 300 yards and to the 44o in relay races.<br />\nNumbers of sprint races are won at the beginning, and defeat is often directly traceable to<br />\na poor, ill-judged start. While \"starting\" is<br />\nof such vital importance, and the space allotted<br />\nme is entirely inadequate to do justice to the<br />\nsubject, I will endeavor to outline at least a<br />\nfew of the most salient points.<br />\nThere are several methods of starting, but<br />\nthe best and fastest for all sorts and conditions<br />\nof ambitious athletes is the crouching or kneeling one that has been, within comparatively a<br />\nfew years, adopted by all of the fastest shortdistance runners.
