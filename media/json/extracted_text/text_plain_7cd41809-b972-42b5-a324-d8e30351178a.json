That object, which has never been realized before,<br />\nhas been sought for ever since history first began to write itself. That<br />\nobject is a universal, a permanent peace. But peace can only be<br />\nmaintained by the good-will and faith among those with whom it<br />\nrests. The purpose of this conference, then, is to aid in the formidable task of crystallizing international confidence. There are two<br />\nmeans of doing this\u2014the limitation of armaments and the decisive<br />\nsettlement of those problems of the Far East which have been clamoring for attention and solution for the past thirty years. The sm.cess of this conference, then, will depend entirely on the settlement of<br />\nthese two issues.<br />\nSome definite conclusion must be reached in regard to the situation in Eastern Asia. There must be more light, more order, in<br />\nEastern affairs. Definite policies must be established. A logical and<br />\nprobable conclusion will be that an international policy will be<br />\nadopted to preserve the integrity of China as the essential basis of<br />\nworld peace. The burden of enforcing this policy would rest with all<br />\nnations. This world interest, however, must be reconciled with Japan's national needs. Finally there must be substituted in future<br />\nAsiatic affairs a spirit of understanding and confidence rather than<br />\nthe past deliberate misunderstanding and violence.<br />\nWith the calling together of delegates from all parts of the world<br />\nto the Peace Conference, a new and better moral atmosphere is already pervading the minds of peoples and rulers. A proposed and<br />\ncomparatively permanent reaction has at last set in against the politics of force in accomplishing necessary or desirable political objects. This improvement is increasing not only in volume, but in<br />\npositive achievement.<br />\nThe Hughes proposals are the expression of a new spirit in international affairs. Armaments are merely one expression of forceful<br />\npolitics and they are universally associated with defensive alliances,<br />\nsecret diplomacy, strategic frontiers, economic exclusiveness and<br />\nnational egotism. They are the mouth and branch of all that which<br />\ncivilization and progress are decreeing must go. The whole wretched<br />\ndisgusting pot-pouri must be outlawed.<br />\nDisarmament is the major issue. It must put an actual and<br />\neffective stop to the competition of building war machines on earth<br />\nand sea. Economically it will save the world from possible bankruptcy, but, more important than ever, it will remove the primary germs of hostile feeling between states. Physical disarmament is not enough. It is not an end but a means\u2014a means toward<br />\nmoral disarmament and a general atmosphere of peace. It is by the<br />\nrealization that arms are hostile to amicable feeling and that their<br />\nabsence causes that to be forgotten for which they stand, that is<br />\nbringing about disarmament today.<br />\nWhen the Washington Conference has accomplished these two<br />\nthings its mission is fulfilled. It has succeeded in that which it has<br />\nundertaken. What it has done, however, is not the goal, not the aim,<br />\nnot the end.

Our selection corresponds to none that has<br />\nbeen published yet this year. Wal-<br />\n<br />\nURING the last twenty-five years power<br />\ngeneration practice has been revolutionized. The steam turbine has definitely displaced the reciprocating engine as the standard<br />\nprime mover in large generating equipments.<br />\nAnd Francis Hodgkinson has had more to do<br />\nwith this achievement than any other one individual.<br />\nMr. Hodgkinson came to this country along<br />\nwith the Westinghouse Licenses under the Parsons patents, in 1896, upon the recommendation<br />\nof the inventor himself. Since that time practically every commercial steam turbine Westinghouse has built has been designed and built by<br />\nhim and his able associates.<br />\nIn this quarter-century of steam-turbine development inventive genius has been paralleled<br />\nthroughout by practical level-headedness. There<br />\nare few cases in engineering history where the<br />\nrecord is writ as clearly and impressively as this.<br />\nThere can be nothing but credit for the engineer<br />\nwho puts his errors underfoot and rises upon<br />\nthem, and most of the world's greatest achievements have been so reached. The World also<br />\n<br />\nD<br />\n<br />\nhonors progress that is surefooted and far-visioned, such as the development of steam turbines<br />\nunder Mr. Hodgkinson's direction.<br />\nMany inventions of tremendous value in<br />\nsteam turbine practice have been devised and<br />\nperfected by him and his co-workers. Among<br />\nthe more important of these are the construction, in 1907, of the first low-pressure turbine to<br />\nbe built in America, and in 1911, of the first<br />\nBleeder type of turbine; the perfection, in company with H. E. Longwell, of the water-seal<br />\ngland; a balancing machine for turbine rotors<br />\nthat is almost superhumanly sensitive; a troubleproof method of supporting turbine cylinders;<br />\nand a very superior process for affixing turbine<br />\nblades to rotor and cylinder.<br />\nOne of the fundamental Westinghouse policies is insistence upon the uttermost in engineering. The observance of this policy in form and<br />\nin spirit has provided genuine opportunities for<br />\nmany men of remarkable engineering gifts, one<br />\nof the most notable of whom is the man whose<br />\nname appears as the title of this article, Francis<br />\nHodgkinson.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "ri<br /><br />\n91,<br /><br />\nRI<br /><br />\nWee<br />\n0 4<br /><br />\ns,o,d<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nVOL.

That object, which has never been realized before,<br />\nhas been sought for ever since history first began to write itself. That<br />\nobject is a universal, a permanent peace. But peace can only be<br />\nmaintained by the good-will and faith among those with whom it<br />\nrests. The purpose of this conference, then, is to aid in the formidable task of crystallizing international confidence. There are two<br />\nmeans of doing this\u2014the limitation of armaments and the decisive<br />\nsettlement of those problems of the Far East which have been clamoring for attention and solution for the past thirty years. The sm.cess of this conference, then, will depend entirely on the settlement of<br />\nthese two issues.<br />\nSome definite conclusion must be reached in regard to the situation in Eastern Asia. There must be more light, more order, in<br />\nEastern affairs. Definite policies must be established. A logical and<br />\nprobable conclusion will be that an international policy will be<br />\nadopted to preserve the integrity of China as the essential basis of<br />\nworld peace. The burden of enforcing this policy would rest with all<br />\nnations. This world interest, however, must be reconciled with Japan's national needs. Finally there must be substituted in future<br />\nAsiatic affairs a spirit of understanding and confidence rather than<br />\nthe past deliberate misunderstanding and violence.<br />\nWith the calling together of delegates from all parts of the world<br />\nto the Peace Conference, a new and better moral atmosphere is already pervading the minds of peoples and rulers. A proposed and<br />\ncomparatively permanent reaction has at last set in against the politics of force in accomplishing necessary or desirable political objects. This improvement is increasing not only in volume, but in<br />\npositive achievement.<br />\nThe Hughes proposals are the expression of a new spirit in international affairs. Armaments are merely one expression of forceful<br />\npolitics and they are universally associated with defensive alliances,<br />\nsecret diplomacy, strategic frontiers, economic exclusiveness and<br />\nnational egotism. They are the mouth and branch of all that which<br />\ncivilization and progress are decreeing must go. The whole wretched<br />\ndisgusting pot-pouri must be outlawed.<br />\nDisarmament is the major issue. It must put an actual and<br />\neffective stop to the competition of building war machines on earth<br />\nand sea. Economically it will save the world from possible bankruptcy, but, more important than ever, it will remove the primary germs of hostile feeling between states. Physical disarmament is not enough. It is not an end but a means\u2014a means toward<br />\nmoral disarmament and a general atmosphere of peace. It is by the<br />\nrealization that arms are hostile to amicable feeling and that their<br />\nabsence causes that to be forgotten for which they stand, that is<br />\nbringing about disarmament today.<br />\nWhen the Washington Conference has accomplished these two<br />\nthings its mission is fulfilled. It has succeeded in that which it has<br />\nundertaken. What it has done, however, is not the goal, not the aim,<br />\nnot the end. It is but the first step forward toward better feeling,<br />\ngood-will, faith and confidence among nations. Where it may lead,<br />\nno one knows\u2014perhaps an association of nations, perhaps in the dim<br />\ndistant future the dreamed of World State\u2014the \"Parliament of Man,<br />\nthe Federation of the World.\"<br /><br />\nONE BRAND-.<br />\nONE QUALITyr<br /><br />\nOne Size Package<br />\nAll our skill, facilities, and lifelong knowledge of<br />\nthe finest tobaccos are concentrated on this one<br />\ncigarette\u2014CAMEL.<br />\nInto this ONE BRAND, we put the utmost quality.

CHARLES ST.<br />\nNEWS-LETTER'S ALL-AMERICAN<br />\nSELECTION<br />\nContinued from page 1<br /><br />\ninformation only those press acccunts of the games in which our<br />\nstars have participated. Our selection corresponds to none that has<br />\nbeen published yet this year. Wal-<br /><br />\nURING the last twenty-five years power<br />\ngeneration practice has been revolutionized. The steam turbine has definitely displaced the reciprocating engine as the standard<br />\nprime mover in large generating equipments.<br />\nAnd Francis Hodgkinson has had more to do<br />\nwith this achievement than any other one individual.<br />\nMr. Hodgkinson came to this country along<br />\nwith the Westinghouse Licenses under the Parsons patents, in 1896, upon the recommendation<br />\nof the inventor himself. Since that time practically every commercial steam turbine Westinghouse has built has been designed and built by<br />\nhim and his able associates.<br />\nIn this quarter-century of steam-turbine development inventive genius has been paralleled<br />\nthroughout by practical level-headedness. There<br />\nare few cases in engineering history where the<br />\nrecord is writ as clearly and impressively as this.<br />\nThere can be nothing but credit for the engineer<br />\nwho puts his errors underfoot and rises upon<br />\nthem, and most of the world's greatest achievements have been so reached. The World also<br /><br />\nD<br /><br />\nhonors progress that is surefooted and far-visioned, such as the development of steam turbines<br />\nunder Mr. Hodgkinson's direction.<br />\nMany inventions of tremendous value in<br />\nsteam turbine practice have been devised and<br />\nperfected by him and his co-workers. Among<br />\nthe more important of these are the construction, in 1907, of the first low-pressure turbine to<br />\nbe built in America, and in 1911, of the first<br />\nBleeder type of turbine; the perfection, in company with H. E. Longwell, of the water-seal<br />\ngland; a balancing machine for turbine rotors<br />\nthat is almost superhumanly sensitive; a troubleproof method of supporting turbine cylinders;<br />\nand a very superior process for affixing turbine<br />\nblades to rotor and cylinder.<br />\nOne of the fundamental Westinghouse policies is insistence upon the uttermost in engineering. The observance of this policy in form and<br />\nin spirit has provided genuine opportunities for<br />\nmany men of remarkable engineering gifts, one<br />\nof the most notable of whom is the man whose<br />\nname appears as the title of this article, Francis<br />\nHodgkinson.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37569, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "3f1f57ed-7744-4ee2-aa1e-8bb251d013c8", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12974-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12974, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "6a84d6a7-078a-4fb1-8d7b-522c2ab50b1b", "url": "/node/12974"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "189db42e-8bdc-4e72-b6b5-8f9406f22dc6"}]}
