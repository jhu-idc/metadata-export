We don't want to miss Fulbright, Lodge,<br />\nMorse or Bundy. We appreciate anti are delighted that<br />\nthe University is tieveloping and expanding as a great<br />\ntenter of political and social thought. We do feel, however, that some new themes are in demand; that other<br />\nareas of human interest should be explored in the<br />\nShriver forum.<br />\nThis is not to suggest that a dusty pedant's talk on<br />\nthe u omen in Marlowe's plays might draw a crowd, but<br />\nthat the University is obligated to provide some informal balance among those areas of interest which a<br />\nmajority here have in common. Certainly everyone<br />\nwants to hear the President anti the Senate Foreign Relations chairman, but there are other safe areas, and<br />\nother giants of thought or accomplishment in these areas.<br />\nIt should not be the responsibility of the Writing<br />\nSeminars to sponsor W.

Wilson Schaffer, Dean of the<br />\nHomewood schools, commented on the<br />\nreasons for the change: \"About four<br />\nyears ago there seemed to be a serious<br />\ndeterioration in dormitory living,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The freshmen appeared to have<br />\nmore trouble adjusting.\"<br />\n\"In addition, we found that while<br />\nmany of the upperclassmen helped the<br />\nfreshmen, others got them into bad<br />\nhabits such as cutting class.\"<br />\nHe also noted a broader change in<br />\nthe emotional make-up of freshmen<br />\nsince the war.<br />\n\"The anxiety and interest, of parents<br />\nhas changed vastly in the past twenty<br />\nyears,\" he said. \"Because the student<br />\ngets more support from his parents, he<br />\nis in some ways more dependent now<br />\nthan in past years.\"<br />\n\"What we are trying to do in the<br />\nfreshman dorms, then, is to give the<br />\nstudents a little bit more on which they<br />\ncan depend (housemasters) if they want<br />\nto, before letting them be completely<br />\nindependent.\"<br />\n\"In a sense,\" he said, \"we are delaying<br />\nfor a year. After that year, the students<br />\nare free to do what they want: continue<br />\nin the upperclass dormitories, live in a<br />\nfraternity, or live off-campus.\"<br />\n\"In general our feeling is that the best<br />\nway for the student to grow up and adjust is to be on his own.\"<br />\nPerhaps the most important and constructive part of the dormitory organization is the housemaster system.

Most of the<br />\nmale dormitory residents are freshmen.<br />\nMost of the rooms in the dormitories<br />\nare doubles, but there are a few suites<br />\nand single rooms. The newer dormitories, built on the lower quadrangle,<br />\nhave rooms that open on to long corridors, while the older dormitory rooms<br />\nface short hallways.<br />\nLiving with the freshmen is a graduate counselor who is most instrumental<br />\nin the effort to effect the student's adjustment to college. The counselor assumes the role of an advisor and friend<br />\nof the students and has charge of about<br />\nfifteen freshmen. His importance was<br />\nstressed by Mr. Homer Wood, an assistant dean and head of the counselor<br />\nprogram, when he stated, \"The freshmaw, year can be tough\u2014the most average, normal student may hit a snag<br />\nwhich he could cope with if there was<br />\nsomeone around to help.\" But the<br />\ncounselor is not a \"professional counselor\". The counselor is chosen for his<br />\nability to make friends quickly and, his<br />\nmaturity; he becomes, in a sense, an<br />\n\"older friend\" to the student, and helps<br />\nwhen he can by taking an interest in<br />\nthe students' problems. The advice that<br />\nthe counselor gives is dictaed by the<br />\ncounselors own experience as an undergraduate and is not tempted by psychorogical training.<br />\nThough fraternities exist at Penn<br />\nthey do not affect the freshman until<br />\nthe second term. Most of the first term<br />\nfreshman's social activity is confmed<br />\nto mixers and some of the sparsely attended university sponsored dances. The<br />\nthree lounges within the dormitory<br />\ncomplex have inadvertently become<br />\nstudy halls, but do provide a large area<br />\nfor mingling after sports events. The<br />\nhours for permitting girls in the dormitories is the same for the freshmen as<br />\nit is for the upperclassmen.<br />\nDuring the second term about fifty<br />\npercent of the freshmen join one of the<br />\nthirty-six fraternities on campus. The<br />\nfraternity then becomes the center of<br />\nthe students social activity. Students<br />\nare permitted to move into fraternity<br />\nhouses the second year in lieu of remaining in the dorms and most fraternity men do so.

Rather then merely build more<br />\nof the then current variety of dormitocry facilities, the administration decided to establish a residential college<br />\nsystem similar to those of Cambridge<br />\nand Oxford. Its small units were designed to be self-sufficient and helped<br />\nto maintain the atmosphere consonant<br />\nwith a small academic community. The<br />\nterm \"college\" merely applies to the<br />\nresidential unit but has no actual academic significance.<br />\nInitially, eight colleges were constructed, each accommodating about<br />\ntwo-hundred and fifty students.

Another<br />\ntwo colleges established after the Second<br />\nWorld War brought the total to twelve<br />\nresidential colleges.<br />\nEach one of the colleges is selfsufficient, providing lodging, dining<br />\nfacilities, recreation facilities, a library<br />\nand graduate counselors. Built about<br />\nquadrangles, the colleges provide a unit<br />\nthat, according to an administration<br />\npamphlet, \"protects the student from<br />\nsubmersion in the vastness characteristic of most large institutions.\"<br />\nA faculty committee selects the students to be admitted to the residential<br />\ncolleges; each college is comprised of<br />\na cross-secion of the entire undergraduate community.

Most of the<br />\nmale dormitory residents are freshmen.<br />\nMost of the rooms in the dormitories<br />\nare doubles, but there are a few suites<br />\nand single rooms. The newer dormitories, built on the lower quadrangle,<br />\nhave rooms that open on to long corridors, while the older dormitory rooms<br />\nface short hallways.<br />\nLiving with the freshmen is a graduate counselor who is most instrumental<br />\nin the effort to effect the student's adjustment to college. The counselor assumes the role of an advisor and friend<br />\nof the students and has charge of about<br />\nfifteen freshmen. His importance was<br />\nstressed by Mr. Homer Wood, an assistant dean and head of the counselor<br />\nprogram, when he stated, \"The freshmaw, year can be tough\u2014the most average, normal student may hit a snag<br />\nwhich he could cope with if there was<br />\nsomeone around to help.\" But the<br />\ncounselor is not a \"professional counselor\". The counselor is chosen for his<br />\nability to make friends quickly and, his<br />\nmaturity; he becomes, in a sense, an<br />\n\"older friend\" to the student, and helps<br />\nwhen he can by taking an interest in<br />\nthe students' problems. The advice that<br />\nthe counselor gives is dictaed by the<br />\ncounselors own experience as an undergraduate and is not tempted by psychorogical training.<br />\nThough fraternities exist at Penn<br />\nthey do not affect the freshman until<br />\nthe second term. Most of the first term<br />\nfreshman's social activity is confmed<br />\nto mixers and some of the sparsely attended university sponsored dances. The<br />\nthree lounges within the dormitory<br />\ncomplex have inadvertently become<br />\nstudy halls, but do provide a large area<br />\nfor mingling after sports events. The<br />\nhours for permitting girls in the dormitories is the same for the freshmen as<br />\nit is for the upperclassmen.<br />\nDuring the second term about fifty<br />\npercent of the freshmen join one of the<br />\nthirty-six fraternities on campus. The<br />\nfraternity then becomes the center of<br />\nthe students social activity. Students<br />\nare permitted to move into fraternity<br />\nhouses the second year in lieu of remaining in the dorms and most fraternity men do so.

Rather then merely build more<br />\nof the then current variety of dormitocry facilities, the administration decided to establish a residential college<br />\nsystem similar to those of Cambridge<br />\nand Oxford. Its small units were designed to be self-sufficient and helped<br />\nto maintain the atmosphere consonant<br />\nwith a small academic community. The<br />\nterm \"college\" merely applies to the<br />\nresidential unit but has no actual academic significance.<br />\nInitially, eight colleges were constructed, each accommodating about<br />\ntwo-hundred and fifty students.
