Johns Hopkins was a close second with 38%<br />\npoints. The other teams ranked behind these as follows: Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Georgetown University, University of North Carolina, Agricultural and Mechanical<br />\nCollege of North Carolina and<br />\nWashington and Lee University.<br />\nMaxson of Virginia was dile individual star, winning three first<br />\nplaces. Dignan of Hopkins and<br />\nCronly of Virginia were tied for<br />\nsecond honors with io points each.<br />\nHorrax of Hopkins won nine points.<br />\nWagner and Lee, both of Hopkins,<br />\nand Legge of Virginia Polytechnic<br />\nInstitute were equal as regards<br />\nfifth honors, each one having six<br />\npoints.<br />\nFive records were broken during<br />\nthe meet. In the 440-yard dash<br />\nStebbins of Georgetown encircled<br />\nthe track in 50 seconds; the former<br />\n<br />\nrecord was 5W5 seconds. Cooke<br />\nof the University of Virgina in the<br />\nhalf-mile ran away from his competitors and made the distance in<br />\nminute 583/5 seconds., beating the<br />\nrecord made last year of 2 minutes<br />\n13/s seconds. Gantt of Virginia won<br />\nthe two-mile run in io minutes II<br />\nseconds, which is almost 30 seconds<br />\nfaster than the former record. The<br />\ntime of the 220-yard hurdles was<br />\ncut down two-fifths of a second by<br />\nCronly of Virginia. The relay team<br />\nfrom Virginia broke the former record held by two Hopkins teams. Another record would have b e en<br />\nbroken, that for the 12o---yard<br />\nhurdles. Cronly covered the ground<br />\nin 153/5 seconds, which beats the<br />\nrecord time made last year by Horrax, but Cronly kicked over one<br />\nhurdle, so his time cannot go as a<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins team had<br />\nhard luck throughout the meet. On<br />\nFriday McDonagh, who had been<br />\ncounted on to place in the 220-yard<br />\ndash and 220-yard hurdles, was running the 220-yard hurdles and was<br />\nin the lead until almost the end.<br />\nHere he fell and skinned his knee.<br />\nHis knee troubled him in the 220(continued on page 5, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\nTHE SENIOR WEEK COMMITTEE<br />\n<br />\nCARLISLE DEFEATS VARSITY<br />\n<br />\nArrangements Made to See After Different Forms of Entertainment\u2014All<br />\nClasses Invited to Participate.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Lacrosse Team Loses<br />\nFirst Game of Season Championship Is Still in Doubt.<br />\n<br />\nLike all perfect things the sojourn<br />\nof the Class of 1913 at Hopkins<br />\nmust come to an end. The date of<br />\nits passing out \"from its alma mater<br />\nfar, far in the wide, wide, wide<br />\nworld\" is set for June io. But what<br />\nof the preeeding weck ? For that<br />\nperiod the 1913 Senior Week Committee is arranging to give a supreme proof in one short week to<br />\ntypify the brilliant record which the<br />\nclass has made during the last four<br />\nyears in all college activities. It has<br />\nbegun to make arrangements for a<br />\nSenior Week which\u2014well, in short<br />\n\u2014will be in keeping with everything<br />\nelse the Class of 1913 has don\u00e7.,<br />\nTo begin to outline plans for such<br />\na week the Senior Week Committee had its first meeting on last<br />\nWednesday at one o'clock. No definite plan could be formulated at<br />\nthis organization meeting. Several<br />\nspecial committees were appointed<br />\nto inquire into the feasibility and the<br />\nexpense of several different forms<br />\nAof entertainment suggested by mem-<br />\n<br />\nFor the seventh time in as many<br />\ngames the Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nupset all calculations and suffered<br />\nits first defeat. The Carlisle Inlians caused the trouble. They came<br />\nup fresh from a- trouncing by the<br />\nNavy to meet a team which had tied<br />\nthe Middies and beaten other teams<br />\nwhich had proved too strong for the<br />\nlads from Annapolis, and the Redskins won 4 to 2. Just why, no one<br />\nseems to know. Without doubt, the<br />\nloss of Sutton and Troxell from the<br />\nline-up was severely felt, but Troxell was out against Lehigh, and Hasson played a fine game at point.<br />\nEvery sort of team is sometimes subject to a slump in spite of all the<br />\ncoaches can do, and that is probably<br />\nwhat happened to the Black \u2022 and<br />\nBlue last Saturday. The silver lining to the cloud is that it was not<br />\na championship game, and we still<br />\nhave a good chance for the banner.<br />\nThe game itself was interesting<br />\nto watch and was not marred by the<br />\nslightest dirty playing.

For a time the<br />\nwhole student body was stirred up<br />\nand excited over getting pictures<br />\ntaken for class pictures, board pictures, fraternity pictures and team<br />\npictures, until it seemed to some that<br />\nthe Hullabaloo would be a sort of<br />\nphotographic supplement to t h e<br />\nClass of 1913. At the present time,<br />\nhowever, all the agony and boosting<br />\nare over, and the University is<br />\nawaiting the publication of the<br />\nmuch-heralded book. The proof<br />\nsheets have been received from the<br />\nprinter and within a few weeks the<br />\nbound volumes will be distributed.<br />\nToo much cannot be said in commendation of the men who have<br />\nworked to produce an annual worthy<br />\nof our college; the men who have<br />\nspent time, money and hard work<br />\nin getting material together, prodding lazy writers, getting advertisements and arranging for details in<br />\nactual printing. It is to the editorial<br />\nand business staff of the Hullabaloo,<br />\nrather than to the Class of 1913,<br />\nthat credit is chiefly due for the publication of a first-class year hook.<br />\nFil'st among these is Mr. Julian<br />\nD. Sears, editor-in-chief, who has<br />\nuntirino,in his efforts and enbeen untiring<br />\nthe very best work<br />\nthusiasm to<br />\nand obtain the very best contributions from the associate editors and<br />\noutside Writers. He it was who<br />\nkept up interest when it seemed almost impossible that the Hullabaloo<br />\ncould be revived this _year. Mr.J.Edward Richardson, Jr., too, deserves<br />\nthe greatest praise for the businesslike way in which he has handled<br />\nthe finances of the Hullabaloo.<br />\nStarting when it seemed as though<br />\nit would be impossible to raise suf-<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \"Clothes.\"<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\n<br />\nHot Water.<br />\n<br />\nAgain is heard the wail, \"No<br />\nhot water.\" In spite of many complaints (unanswered) there is always a scarcity of of hot water for<br />\nthe athletic teams, both in the cage<br />\nand at Homewood.

The track and field<br />\nteam is as well, if not better,<br />\nequipped this year than ever before.<br />\nBecause of the heavy expense the<br />\nteam is under, due largely to the<br />\ninterscholastic meet, which is a direct loss, it is impossible to give<br />\nevery member of the squad full<br />\nequipment.<br />\nAt the present time the finances of<br />\nthe team are in better condition than<br />\nhas been the case for several years,<br />\nand the indications are that instead<br />\nof a large deficit, which has been<br />\nthe custom in many previous years,<br />\nthere will be a small surplus.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nPAUL 0.

It is true that whatever attitude may be adopted by the Athletic Association or the management<br />\nis none of my business, but the<br />\nquestions involved are such that<br />\nthey can hardly be discussed by the<br />\nteam members who have suffered,<br />\nand as publicity can certainly do no<br />\nharm, but on the contrary may do a<br />\ngreat deal of good, I venture to be<br />\nthe one to write a letter which will<br />\nvoice the sentiments of many.<br />\nThe Armory meet, in which the<br />\ninterests of the University were<br />\nlooked after by the track athletic<br />\nmanagement, netted more than ever<br />\nbefore. The exact figures were not<br />\nannounced, but the gain was at least<br />\none or two hundred dollars. This<br />\ndoes not go to the credit of the track<br />\nteam, but to a separate account..<br />\nSuch a disposal is, of course, merely<br />\na.matter of bookkeeping, but it certainly seems fair that the track<br />\nsquad should get some of the benefits of the extra money.

For a time the<br />\nwhole student body was stirred up<br />\nand excited over getting pictures<br />\ntaken for class pictures, board pictures, fraternity pictures and team<br />\npictures, until it seemed to some that<br />\nthe Hullabaloo would be a sort of<br />\nphotographic supplement to t h e<br />\nClass of 1913. At the present time,<br />\nhowever, all the agony and boosting<br />\nare over, and the University is<br />\nawaiting the publication of the<br />\nmuch-heralded book. The proof<br />\nsheets have been received from the<br />\nprinter and within a few weeks the<br />\nbound volumes will be distributed.<br />\nToo much cannot be said in commendation of the men who have<br />\nworked to produce an annual worthy<br />\nof our college; the men who have<br />\nspent time, money and hard work<br />\nin getting material together, prodding lazy writers, getting advertisements and arranging for details in<br />\nactual printing. It is to the editorial<br />\nand business staff of the Hullabaloo,<br />\nrather than to the Class of 1913,<br />\nthat credit is chiefly due for the publication of a first-class year hook.<br />\nFil'st among these is Mr. Julian<br />\nD.

He it was who<br />\nkept up interest when it seemed almost impossible that the Hullabaloo<br />\ncould be revived this _year.

It is true that whatever attitude may be adopted by the Athletic Association or the management<br />\nis none of my business, but the<br />\nquestions involved are such that<br />\nthey can hardly be discussed by the<br />\nteam members who have suffered,<br />\nand as publicity can certainly do no<br />\nharm, but on the contrary may do a<br />\ngreat deal of good, I venture to be<br />\nthe one to write a letter which will<br />\nvoice the sentiments of many.<br />\nThe Armory meet, in which the<br />\ninterests of the University were<br />\nlooked after by the track athletic<br />\nmanagement, netted more than ever<br />\nbefore. The exact figures were not<br />\nannounced, but the gain was at least<br />\none or two hundred dollars. This<br />\ndoes not go to the credit of the track<br />\nteam, but to a separate account..<br />\nSuch a disposal is, of course, merely<br />\na.matter of bookkeeping, but it certainly seems fair that the track<br />\nsquad should get some of the benefits of the extra money. Up to the<br />\npresent they haven't.<br />\nThe candidates are compelled to<br />\nfurnish practically the whole of their<br />\nequipment. Some material, it is<br />\ntrue, is bought for the graduate and<br />\nmedical students, but undergraduates who are not in such circumstances that they can afford to purchase expensive spiked shoes or<br />\nother articles have, if they wish to.<br />\nrun as well as possible, been compelled to furnish the appurtenances.<br />\nEconomy is under all circumstances much to be desired, but<br />\nthere is such a thing as a policy of<br />\ninconsistent closeness which is decidedly objectionable. Every football man last season was furnished<br />\nwith a complete outfit to the smallest<br />\ndetail. With the exception of<br />\ngloves, this has been true of the<br />\nbaseball team.

The<br />\nopportunity was lost.<br />\nTo conclude, there seems to be no<br />\nvalid reason for not treating the<br />\ntrack team on a parity with other<br />\nteams in the matter of equipment,<br />\nand this hasn't been done. When<br />\nmore money than ever before was<br />\nnetted on the Armory games, there<br />\nseems to be no sufficient reason for<br />\nnot giving certain of our athletes,<br />\nwho are among the best in the country, a chance to show their ability<br />\nand advertise Hppkins sports in<br />\nmeets against other colleges.
