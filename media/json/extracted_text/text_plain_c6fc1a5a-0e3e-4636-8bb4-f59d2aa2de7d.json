This is what the intelligent<br />\nman calls the finer things of life and<br />\nonce he has acquired an appreciation of these things he is entitled<br />\nto be called a scholar in our sense<br />\nof the word. Though facts and<br />\nfigures may escape such a man, he<br />\nstill remembers that there is knowledge worth having beyond the<br />\nsphere of everyday life.<br />\nWithout college training it is only<br />\nthe exceptional person who is a<br />\nscholar in this sense. Although he<br />\nmay not be aware of the fact, college makes such a scholar of the<br />\nmain who comes here without a<br />\ndefinite purpose in mind or for lack<br />\nof something better to do.<br />\nThis should be one of college's<br />\nvain contributions to a well thoughtout philosophy of life. A scholar,<br />\nwithout scholarly achievements, he<br />\nrecognizes the place of knowledge<br />\nin the scheme of things.

The one, Levering Hall, was started during<br />\nDr. Goodnow's term of office, but has opened under the new regime.<br />\nThe other, the Physics Building, will be ready for occupancy in the next<br />\nfew weeks. Several large endowments have been received, particularly<br />\nfor the Medical School, by which the process of enlargement and construction is steadily progressing. New instructors have been added in<br />\nseveral departments of the college. More students are enrolling under<br />\nthe New Plan; the Law Institute is spreading the reputation of Johns<br />\nHopkins still farther.<br />\nThe last named institution, the New Plan and the Law Institute, are<br />\nthe projects which have devolved upon Dr. Ames to develop. Both<br />\nare new ideas, merely in their infancy. Both are so worthwhile that<br />\nthey overshadow the college, which it must be remembered, is merely<br />\na part of the great University over which Dr. Ames presides. The<br />\nNew Plan, unlike the Law Institute, has found much opposition. It<br />\nhas been contended that Hopkins will be an institution purely for the<br />\nspecialized worker and that those merely searching for a general cultural education must suffer. Precisely. However, there are many colleges offering this general education, but only a few where the advanced<br />\nstudent will be able to derive as much advantage as at Hopkins. To<br />\ndevelop a school of scholars, that is the undertaking which confronts<br />\nDr. Ames. The Law Institute, equally as great a project, has already<br />\nreceived the highest praise throughout the country. The jurists of the<br />\ncountry have long been bemoaning the multiplicity and stupidity of<br />\nsome of our laws, but Hopkins has stopped talking about it; it is doing<br />\nsomething about it. These two great projects were begun under<br />\nPresident Goodnow ; they remain to be developed under President<br />\nAmes.<br />\n<br />\nTurn the light on the Truth!<br />\nIt's just naturally good tobacco\u2014not \"artificial treatment\" that<br />\nmakes OLD GOLD gentle to the throat and better to the taste<br />\nNo one cigarette-maker has any monopoly on<br />\nthe heat-treatment of cigarette tobaccos.<br />\nFor heat-treating is neither new nor exclusive.<br />\nIt has been used for years by practically all<br />\ncigarette-makers to \"set\" and sterilize their<br />\ntobacco.<br />\n<br />\nThe Board of Trustees have chosen a man as president who has been<br />\nuniversally admired in the past and has proven himself extremely<br />\ncapable of dealing with the problems of the future; for this we thank<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\nBut OLD GOLD's goodness does not depend on<br />\nartificial treatment.

The one, Levering Hall, was started during<br />\nDr. Goodnow's term of office, but has opened under the new regime.<br />\nThe other, the Physics Building, will be ready for occupancy in the next<br />\nfew weeks. Several large endowments have been received, particularly<br />\nfor the Medical School, by which the process of enlargement and construction is steadily progressing. New instructors have been added in<br />\nseveral departments of the college. More students are enrolling under<br />\nthe New Plan; the Law Institute is spreading the reputation of Johns<br />\nHopkins still farther.<br />\nThe last named institution, the New Plan and the Law Institute, are<br />\nthe projects which have devolved upon Dr. Ames to develop. Both<br />\nare new ideas, merely in their infancy. Both are so worthwhile that<br />\nthey overshadow the college, which it must be remembered, is merely<br />\na part of the great University over which Dr. Ames presides. The<br />\nNew Plan, unlike the Law Institute, has found much opposition. It<br />\nhas been contended that Hopkins will be an institution purely for the<br />\nspecialized worker and that those merely searching for a general cultural education must suffer. Precisely. However, there are many colleges offering this general education, but only a few where the advanced<br />\nstudent will be able to derive as much advantage as at Hopkins. To<br />\ndevelop a school of scholars, that is the undertaking which confronts<br />\nDr. Ames. The Law Institute, equally as great a project, has already<br />\nreceived the highest praise throughout the country. The jurists of the<br />\ncountry have long been bemoaning the multiplicity and stupidity of<br />\nsome of our laws, but Hopkins has stopped talking about it; it is doing<br />\nsomething about it. These two great projects were begun under<br />\nPresident Goodnow ; they remain to be developed under President<br />\nAmes.<br /><br />\nTurn the light on the Truth!<br />\nIt's just naturally good tobacco\u2014not \"artificial treatment\" that<br />\nmakes OLD GOLD gentle to the throat and better to the taste<br />\nNo one cigarette-maker has any monopoly on<br />\nthe heat-treatment of cigarette tobaccos.<br />\nFor heat-treating is neither new nor exclusive.<br />\nIt has been used for years by practically all<br />\ncigarette-makers to \"set\" and sterilize their<br />\ntobacco.<br /><br />\nThe Board of Trustees have chosen a man as president who has been<br />\nuniversally admired in the past and has proven himself extremely<br />\ncapable of dealing with the problems of the future; for this we thank<br />\nthem.<br /><br />\nBut OLD GOLD's goodness does not depend on<br />\nartificial treatment.

But it was Dr. Ames, the man, not Dr. Ames, the<br />\nadministrator, who caused the undergraduates to appreciate so much<br />\nthe decision of the Board. His ideals of fairness, with which he judged<br />\neach man and each situation, represents to the campus the highest<br />\nquality of a university official.
