The 48% turnout for last year's S.C. presidential<br />\nelections is the only percentage of student response which was greater<br />\nwithin the last ten years. The.40% response is much greater than the<br />\nnormal turnout for class elections, which runs from 25% to 35%. .<br />\nOf the 1890 undergraduates on the Homewood campus, 732 voted<br />\nfor the 4-1-4 system, with only 37 against, and 2 abstentions.<br />\nPercentage-wise, this breaks down to 94.8% for, 4.8% against, and .4%<br />\nwith no opinion.<br />\nPassarella, commenting on the abolishment of the final exam period<br />\nfelt that it might induce professors to find \"more viable alternatives to the<br />\nthree-hour final exam period, which I question as a test of knowledge.\"<br />\nTwo of the more controversial provisions in the proposal \u2014 the<br />\nabolishment of the final exam period and the wini-semester \u2014 though not<br />\non the ballot as Separate questions, were part of the original proposal, and<br />\nthus received their support by the acceptance of the proposal as a whole.<br />\n(Continued on page 5)<br />\n<br />\n\"Radicals\" Censure Political Science Department<br />\nBy S.

FRANCIS ROURKE,who instituted new changes in the<br />\nPolitical Science Department.<br />\n<br />\nThe introduction reads, in part: \"Academic<br />\nexcellence, intellectual curiosity, creativity and<br />\ninnovative faculty and students are prerequisite for the<br />\nexistence of an outstanding graduate department. In our<br />\nopinion, the Department of Political Science at Johns<br />\nHopkins has failed to qualify. Lethargy and stifling<br />\nnonchalance have frequently led to intellectual<br />\nvegetation. Critical problems are brushed under a carpet<br />\nalternately labled \"professionalism\" ... and \"this is a<br />\nresearch school.\" Co-optation is the favorite prescription<br />\nfor discontent and polite mumblings too often pretend<br />\nto be meaningful communication.\"<br />\n\"Deliberately Overstated\"<br />\nMrs. Cindy Wedel, a first year student and the<br />\nauthor of the minority report, stressed that it was<br />\n\"deliberately overstated\" since it was intended. as a<br />\n\"spur to action\" to dramatize the extent of<br />\ndissatisfaction.<br />\nThe report also contained a list of concrete<br />\ngrievances, including: some \"lack of concern with<br />\nteaching\" by much of the faculty; absence of a \"sense of<br />\ncommunity among its members\" which limits potential<br />\nstimulation through interaction; a \"dehumanizing,<br />\ndeadening atmosphere\" as a result; lack of a senior<br />\npolitical theorist and an urbanologist; problems with<br />\npart-time professors who lack time for consultation and<br />\nwho often fail to bring the expected experience and<br />\nexpertise; and inadequacies in the master's requirements<br />\nand statistics option.<br />\nJunior Instructor<br />\nAlso mentioned was the Junior Instructor<br />\nprogram, which \"because of the little briefing and no<br />\ncounseling given\" results in confusion and apathy which<br />\ngives undergraduates \"a picture of the department which<br />\n<br />\nis unenthusiastic, lazy and even incompetent. Exams are<br />\ngraded haphazardly and with insufficient cOncern for<br />\nconsistency.\"<br />\nMrs. Wedel stated the protest was developed after<br />\nlong discussions among the first-year students, who<br />\ncalled a meeting February 10 of all the graduates at<br />\nwhich a committee was chosen to draft a resolution of<br />\ngrievance to the faculty.

There was, unfortunately,<br />\nconfusion between the Carlyle Barton Laboratory and the<br />\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering.<br />\nThe Carlyle Barton Laboratory is housed in Barton Hall, a<br />\nbuilding on the Homewood campus which contains, in addition to<br />\nAdministration offices and offices of faculty from several<br />\ndepartments,research facilities supported by contracts and grants.<br />\nOne of these activities is the research project called the Carlyle ,<br />\nBarton Laboratory. This laboratory does research for the Air Force!'<br />\na fraction of which is classified (less than 25%); and this is the only<br />\nclassified research in Barton Hall. Three members of the Electrical ,<br />\nEngineering Department have research contracts or grants that<br />\nsupport activities in Barton Hall. Of these three, only one is on the<br />\nstaff of the Carlyle Barton Laboratory. All of these have professorial<br />\nappointments with the Electrical Engineering Department.<br />\nBecause of an unfrotunate confusion between the Electrical<br />\nEngineering Department and the Barton Laboratory, the N-L<br />\nattributed figures given to the reporter to the Electrical Engineering<br />\nDeparrtment when, in fact, Dr. Hamburger was discussing only the<br />\nCarlyle Barton Laboratory.<br />\nHamburger further noted, in last week's article, that the<br />\nBarton Laboratozy published 23 reports, five of which were<br />\nclassified. This was mistakenly reported as relating to the Electrical<br />\nEngineering Department itself.<br />\nLast week's article indicated that a researcher in the Barton<br />\nLaboratory, working under a military contract, devoted 80% of his<br />\ntime to applied but not necessarily classified research. At least half<br />\nthat time is spent on research which is definitely not classified. The<br />\nother half is directed along more closely military-related topics.<br />\nFor further information, see Dr. Hamburger's letter, p. 16.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nSaga Thwarts Thieving Scum!<br />\nA brief scuffle broke out in the dormitory<br />\ncafeteria Tuesday night, as an off-campus student<br />\ntried to get into the dining room on a borrwoed<br />\nidentification card.<br />\nSteve Pogoloff, a sophomore who lives on<br />\nSt. Paul Street, attempted to use the Saga id card<br />\nof an unidentified freshman to get a free dinner<br />\nat the cafeteria.

He<br />\ncalled the whole affair \"an unfortunate<br />\nincident.\"<br />\nAnother student worker for Saga, Miley<br />\nWalker, explained that the regular procedure in<br />\nsuch cases is simply to take away the<br />\nidentification card and keep it in the Saga office<br />\nin the cafeteria until the proper student comes to<br />\nclaim it. The cards are non-transferable and Saga<br />\nuses them to insure that off-campus students do<br />\nnot take advantage of the meals that dormitory<br />\nresidents have already paid for.<br />\nTwo Baltimore police officers reported to<br />\nthe dorm cafeteria at about 6:20 p.m. and<br />\nquestioned the individuals involved in the<br />\nincident.

Groves, along with JO<br />\nArchibald, newly elected president of<br />\nAWARE, Kathy Lewis, Dick Janis and<br />\nBaltimore housing inspectors and other<br />\nhousing agency officials found that<br />\ncomplaints against some of the<br />\nslumlords have gone unattended since<br />\n1965. Herbert Kaufman had the most<br />\noutstanding notices, with 123, followed<br />\nby Louis Shapiro with 83. Other leading<br />\noffenders were the Needles, the Kails,<br />\nand the Klotzmans.<br />\nIn accordance with the group's<br />\nexpectations, the violations were tightlY<br />\nclustered around the Monument Street<br />\narea in the East Ghetto. These<br />\nconditions were found also to<br />\npredominate in the Western Ghetto<br />\nareas of the city.

The film, \"Off the Pig\" was<br />\nmade, in part, at the prison where Newton is presently<br />\nbeing held for the death of a policeman.<br />\nThe Cleaver interview was held before he went<br />\ninto exile to avoid imprisonment for parole violation.<br />\nThe remainder of the film showed scenes of Panther<br />\nrallies throughout the country.<br />\nBaltimore Party Chief<br />\nCaptain Warren Hart, then spoke on the principles<br />\nof the Black Panthers and the problems that are faced by<br />\nthe. revolutionary - organization in dealing with the<br />\nvarious factions of the Black community.<br />\nHe claimed that one major problem faced by the<br />\norganization is the middle-class Negroes, both in the<br />\ncommunity and in the Black colleges. Hart scorned the<br />\nMorgan State College students for having forgotten the<br />\nenvironment from ' which they came, calling them<br />\n\"middle-class niggers.\"<br />\nCaptain Hart also criticized the leaders of other<br />\nNegro organizations, referring to them as \"Uncle Toms.\"<br />\nHe added, \"The Uncle Toms have blisters on their<br />\n<br />\ntongues from licking boots.\" He went on to say that any<br />\ntime a man voices opposition to the \"racist system\" he<br />\n\"will have a record; not one, but fifteen or twenty<br />\narrests\".<br />\nNot Racists<br />\nExplaining that the Black Panthers are not racist<br />\nthemselves, Hart claimed that the Black community<br />\nneeds the help of the White revolutionaries. He said that<br />\nthe members of SDS are \"beautiful\" and said that with<br />\nthe continued cooperation of SDS and the Peace and<br />\nFreedom Party the movement can continue and achieve<br />\nits goals.<br />\nHart claimed that we \"have to organize a Black<br />\nrevolutionary army with the support of White<br />\nrevolutionaries.\" He emphasized that the movement<br />\nneeds the help of the Whites, saying, \"We cannot do it<br />\nalone\"<br />\nHart claimed that Baltimore is \"one of the most<br />\ncomplacent cities,\" and for that reason there is the<br />\npossibility that Eldrige Cleaver will come out of exile<br />\nhere for the purpose of stirring the community.<br />\nThe Baltimore Panther said that the reason for this<br />\ncity's lethargy is the large number of schools and<br />\nfactories in the area. He said that a large part of the<br />\nBlack community has either received so much<br />\n\"programming\" from the White school system that they<br />\ndo not revolt against it, or has comfortable jobs.<br />\n<br />\nCaptain Hart criticized New York's first Negro<br />\nCongresswoman, Shirley Chisolm, calling her \"a disgrace<br />\nto the Black people.\" He went on to predict that she will<br />\n\"do as much for the Black man as George Wallace does.\"<br />\nThe White establishment was warned that the<br />\nBlack Panther Party could not be stopped by \"cutting<br />\noff the heads\" of the movement. Hart claimed that the<br />\norganization had grown to such proportions that it<br />\nwould continue even if key members were eliminated.<br />\nHe went on to say that police agencies across the nation<br />\nintimidate Black Panthers constantly, but do not bother<br />\nthe reactionary organizations in the U.

This is explained by the possibility of a passing comet altering the course of<br />\nthe Earth's orbit, and thus explaining the appearance of the Sun standing still.<br />\nUntil the time of this natural phenomenon<br />\nthere were only four visible planets (Saturn,<br />\nJupitur, Mars, and Mercury), but there are no<br />\nindications of the luminous morning star, Venus.<br />\nAfter the time of Joshua there are reports of<br />\nVenus. Dr. Velikovsky claims that the formation<br />\nof Venus took place during this period, saying<br />\nthat the planet had been a comet whose orbit<br />\napproached that of the Earth closely, causing<br />\nvarious catastrophes, and had finally settled into<br />\nits present harmless orbit.<br />\nThe scientific world received the<br />\nintroduction of these extraordinary views with<br />\nvast dissaproval. Harlow Shapley, noted<br />\nastronomer, claimed, \"If Dr. Velikovsky is right,<br />\nthe rest of us are crazy\". Many of the theories<br />\nintroduced by Dr. Velikovsky both in \"Worlds in<br />\nCollision\" and succeeding works have been<br />\nproven to have some validity.<br />\nBorn in Vitebsk, Russia, in 1895, Dr.<br />\nVelikovsky received his medical education at the<br />\nUniversity of Edenburg and the University of<br />\nMoscow. He received his degree from the latter<br />\ninstitution in 1921. He has lived in Germany and<br />\nPalestine, and now lives in Princeton, New<br />\nDR.IMMANUEL VELIKOVSKY<br />\nJersey.<br />\n<br />\nMarch 4 Talks,Demonstrations Held Across Nation<br />\nOn some campuses, such as the University of<br />\nPennsylvania, all undergraduate and many graduate<br />\nclasses were called off to hold a day-long series of<br />\nseminars.

In other words, a legitimate<br />\nstudent organization pressed for legitimate demands<br />\nthrough legitimate administrative channels.<br />\nIn a News-Letter of Homewood faculty opinion,<br />\nmost of those interviewed equivocated\u2014they approved of<br />\ncalendar reform in general, but objected to some aspect<br />\nof the four-one-four system in particular.<br />\nDean Swanson, while addressing the March 3rd<br />\nmeeting of the Student Council, foresaw the faculty<br />\nreaction. At the meeting, he prodded to uncover the<br />\n\"real goals\" of the Council,on the calendar reform<br />\nquestion. Would the Council settle for 1969<br />\nimplementation of portions of the four-one-four, or<br />\nelimination of the \"mini-semester\"?<br />\nThe consensus of the meeting as expressed by SC<br />\nPresident Russ Passarella was that \"the Council ought to<br />\nstand on the calendar reform as a whole.\"<br />\nHowever, Passarella has since taken note of the<br />\npossibility for a one year deferral of the \"mini-semester\"<br />\nin order to facilitate 1969 implementation of the<br />\nbalance of the calendar reform proposals.<br />\nThe charge of Dr. William Bevan's ad hoc<br />\nCommittee on the Academic Calendar (which produced<br />\nthe four-one-four recommendation) read in part: \"To<br />\nconsider the widespread undergraduate preference for a<br />\nschedule change which would (1) provide for an early<br />\ntermination date in the spring in order that they might<br />\nhave a better opportunity for summer jobs, and (2)<br />\nprovide a first term which ends at the Christmas holiday<br />\nso that the holiday could be a true one and not an<br />\nintensive study period, and which would eliminate the<br />\ngenerally unproductive two-week class period following<br />\n<br />\nthe Christmas holiday.\"<br />\nBevan's plan would not shorten Christmas or<br />\nsummer vacations, nor would it shorten appreciably the<br />\namount of course time that could be devoted to<br />\nteaching.<br />\nPresently each of the two semesters runs<br />\napproximately 16 weeks. Under the new proposals, each<br />\nof thellong semesters would be shortened to 14 weeks<br />\nby the abolishment of formal final examination periods.<br />\nThis is not to say that final exams will necessarily be<br />\neliminated. Their presence will remain at the discretion<br />\nof the individual faculty member.<br />\nThe abolition of formal examination periods is<br />\nessential to 1969 implementation of any variation of the<br />\nfour-one-four recommendations. However, the<br />\nMWF-TTh class scheduling recommendations which have<br />\nalso come under considerable fire are not.<br />\nThere remains a paradox. Although a major intent<br />\nof the calendar reform effort is to facilitate<br />\ninterdivisional exchanges within the university, the<br />\nadministration has also shown that it was aware of and<br />\ncared about the existence of an undergraduate program.<br />\nBut it did so without consultation of the undergraduates<br />\nthemselves, and they were to ask simply to await the<br />\nverdict of an older and wiser administration and faculty.<br />\nIt appears that it is the \"gall\" of the<br />\nundergraduates\u2014who have taken a stand on an extremely<br />\nimportant issue\u2014that irritates faculty members. It is<br />\ninteresting to note that Dr. Gordon, upon receipt of the<br />\noriginal Student Council demands, \"laughed the whole<br />\nthing off,\" until Passarella and Manuel Rodriguez<br />\nreminded him that a student strike, once begun, might<br />\nget out of hand.<br />\nIn this light, it becomes apparent that, although<br />\nthe Student Council attempted to act \"responsibly\", it<br />\nwas the threat of a \"student strike\" that motivated<br />\nadministration action. (i.e. the special meeting of the<br />\nGeneral Faculty Assembly and the inclusion of calendar<br />\nreform in the agenda of the Academic Council meeting,<br />\nscheduled for the day after Gordon received the SC's<br />\nletter).<br />\nThe mood of the administrative reaction is not<br />\nsurprising. Last year, in his address to the university Oust<br />\nprior to May exams), President Gordon reminded<br />\nstudents that if they were desirous of quality<br />\ncollege-style teaching, they should have gone to<br />\nAmherst.<br />\nHopkins administrators readily admit that the<br />\nfunction of the University lies in the realm of the<br />\n\"advancement of knowledge.\"<br />\nIn other words, the University is run for faculty,<br />\nthose students interested in research (mostly graduate<br />\nstudents), and for those undergraduates who will \"grow<br />\nup\" to advance knowledge themselves, after being<br />\nnestled in the proper environment.<br />\nDespite conjectured motives of the<br />\nadministration's actions, the fact remains that it did act,<br />\nand acted to speed consideration of the calendar reform<br />\n<br />\nrecommendations.<br />\nExperiences at Bennington, Reed, Smith,<br />\nDuquesne, Fordham, Oberlin, Rochester, Virginia,<br />\nWilliams, and a host of lesser-known institutions make<br />\nthe operational feasibility of the four-one-four system<br />\nbeyond question.<br />\nHowever, the advantages of the JanuarY<br />\n\"mini-semester\" have been questioned. According to Dr.<br />\nBevan, \"the January term would undoubtably mean<br />\nmore work for at least some of the faculty, but at the<br />\nsame time provide freedom for a time from the<br />\nday-to-day routines of the usual term schedule and an<br />\nopportunity to try new instructional experiments.<br />\nPerhaps the most widely scheduled activity during the<br />\nJanuary term will be independent study.\"<br />\nThe resolution of the problem of what to do with<br />\nthe \"mini-semester\" will be left to the faculty and,<br />\nhopefully, the students of the individual departments.<br />\nThus, the faculty will have a decisive voice, beyond<br />\ntoday's vote, on how they will spend their time.<br />\nThe student body could call a general strike, but<br />\nwhy should such measures be necessary\u2014in the light of<br />\nineffective undergraduate enfranchisement\u2014because the<br />\nundergraduate body must look to the faculty for<br />\nguardianship?<br />\nThe faculty, with whom lies the ultimate decision<br />\non reform, should remember to overlook personal gripes,<br />\nand vote for the benefit of the entire community. To do<br />\nso, they must, in good conscience, look to their<br />\nstudents. The Student Council referendum should<br />\nsuffice to provide the necessary counsel.<br />\n<br />\nDEAN SWANSON, who foresaw difficulty with the faculty.<br />\n<br />\nMany Professors Surveyed Indifferent to Reform<br />\nIn a N-L survey of 75<br />\nprofessors regarding the question<br />\nof calendar reform, 30.5%<br />\nindicated that they would vote in<br />\nfavor of the committee proposal<br />\nas it was submitted; 29.5% said<br />\nthey would vote no, and 40% had<br />\nmade no decision as yet.<br />\nThe survey, which was taken in<br />\nthe early part of the week, indicated<br />\nthat the proposal was, in the words of<br />\none professor, \"in for rough going.\"<br />\nMost of the objections to the report<br />\nwere directed mainly at specific<br />\nportions of the report, rather than the<br />\nreport as a whole. Over 70% of those<br />\n<br />\nDR. WILLIAM McELROY<br />\n<br />\ninterviewed were in favor of calendar<br />\nreform of some sort. Those who intend<br />\nto vote no, for the most part, will vote<br />\nno because of specific portions of the<br />\nreport which they feel they cannot live<br />\nwith.<br />\nA number of professors indicated<br />\ndisappointment with the proposed<br />\nchanges, feeling that it would still mean<br />\na variety of calendars for the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. One Faculty member<br />\nindicated, \"I am indifferent to calendar<br />\nreform. If I see that the majority of the<br />\nstudents are for the proposal then I'll<br />\nprobably vote for it.\" This seemed to<br />\nsum up the attitudes of the 21% of the<br />\nfaculty who had no opinion on the<br />\ncalendar reform issue, in general.<br />\nOpposition to the mini-semester<br />\nran strongest in the sciences, as one<br />\nfaculty member in the sciences<br />\nindicated, \"I really don't know what the<br />\nhell we are going to do with it.\"<br />\nAnother in the sciences stated, \"I am<br />\nopposed to the mini-semester because it<br />\ntakes away from a month of research<br />\nboth I and the graduate students do in<br />\nthe summer. If this month is substituted<br />\nin January, they just won't do the<br />\nresearch, but mainly try to make up a<br />\nsubject from last quarter.\" Nearly 48%<br />\nof the Faculty subscribed to this or<br />\nother arguments to voice their<br />\ndisapproval of the mini-semester. Others<br />\nproduced other reasons, such as \"extra<br />\nbureaucracy\" or \"I've taught under the<br />\nsystem and I don't like it.\"<br />\nA number of those. interviewed<br />\n,took a \"we might as well try iit\",<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nattitude, towards the 4-1-4 system with<br />\nits mini-semester. Said one faculty<br />\nmember, \"Both systems appear pretty<br />\ninefficient, but a new inefficiency will<br />\nat least be a novelty.\"<br />\nMuch of the faculty deplored the<br />\nloss of flexibility which they felt would<br />\nresult from the Monday-Wednesday-Friday class schedule. They were<br />\ngenerally split as to the academic<br />\nefficacy of one class schedule over<br />\nanother. One professor stated that<br />\nHopkins is one of the few universities<br />\nthat he knows of that has a<br />\nMonday-Tuesday-Wednesday class<br />\nsystem; \"Once you get used to it, it's<br />\nreally a much better system,\" he added.<br />\nMost of the professors who<br />\napproved of the abolishment of the final<br />\nexam period felt that it would be a step<br />\nin the direction of testing of the<br />\nstudent's true knowledge. Said one,<br />\n\"The finals now just show how a<br />\nstudent can work under stress. Many<br />\ntimes the grades of the finals do not<br />\nreflect the true knowledge of the<br />\nstudent.\" Those who opposed it did not<br />\nusually see any visable alternative to<br />\nexams for their courses, and felt that it<br />\nwould be unfair to the students to make<br />\nthem take exams during the regular class<br />\nperiod.<br />\nThe comments on the SC's actions<br />\nduring the calendar discussion ranged<br />\nfrom \"absur d\" to \"over-reacting.\"<br />\nAlmost no one felt that their actions<br />\nreally added to a resolving of the<br />\ncalendar discussion., The main point of<br />\nobjection seemed tq be the use of the<br />\n<br />\nword \"demand\" in the Council's<br />\nresolution: Said one Chemistry<br />\nprofessor, \"My only knowledge of the<br />\nissue comes from the N-L, and that gives<br />\nme a weak premise for the formulation<br />\nof an opinion.\"<br />\nThe Poll:<br />\n1) What is your general reaction to the<br />\ncalendar reform issue?<br />\nFavorable: 70% Unfavorable: 9% No<br />\nOpinion: 21%<br />\n2)Do you approve of the 4-1-4 system?<br />\nYes: 40% No: 33% No Opinion: 27%<br />\n3)Do you approve of the mini-semester?<br />\nYes: 35% No: 48%.No Opinion: 17%<br />\n4)Do you approve of the Monday,<br />\nWednesday, Friday, and Tuesday,<br />\nThursday class system?<br />\nYes: 32% No: 45% No Opinion: 23%<br />\n5)Do you approve of the abolishment<br />\nof the final exam period?<br />\nYes: 44% No: 35% No Opinion: 21%<br />\n6) What was your reaction to the<br />\nstudent council's approach to the<br />\ncalendar reform question?<br />\nFavorable: 25% Unfavorable: 48% No<br />\nOpinion: 27%<br />\n7)How do you intend to vote at the<br />\ngeneral assembly meeting on the 14th of<br />\nMarch?<br />\nFor: 30.5% Against: 29.5% Undecided:<br />\n40%<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 14, 1969<br />\n<br />\nFaculty Discusses Calendar<br />\nBy MARK REUTTER<br />\n<br />\nMany faculty members were undecided as to how<br />\nthey would bote at the Assembly, maintaining that they<br />\n\"want only what the students really want.\" The S.

The professors felt that such a<br />\nsystem would unnecessarily inhibit their time, especially<br />\nFriday classes when they have weekend conferences. In<br />\nreply, Dean- Swanson remarked, \"One reason (for the<br />\nMWF) arose out of the departments of medicine where<br />\nthey think they need a day of preparation between their<br />\nlaboratory classes.\"<br />\nDislike MWF Plan<br />\nOne professor asked that there be \"no implications<br />\nof the MWF plan in the calendar proposal Friday.\"<br />\nAlthough no such assurance was made due to the<br />\nprocedural rules of the meeting, it seemed apparent that<br />\nthe MWF proposal would be considered separate from<br />\nthe main issue of calendar reform.<br />\nMost of the professors attending the Tuesday<br />\nmeeting had a number of reservations tO the<br />\n\"mini-semester\" plan. \"Students are under a delusion<br />\nabout the `mini-semester' if they think they can all<br />\nreceive individual guidance,\" one professor said. Another<br />\nadded cynically, \"I know for a Qact that many students<br />\nare looking at the January period as a long vacatipn.\"<br />\nIt was furthermore tentatively agreed that<br />\n\"mini-semester\" programs may not be offered in all<br />\ndepartments. Some professors believed it would take<br />\nthem some time to formulate course plans for a 4-week<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThe informal meeting also illustrated two basically<br />\nopposed camps of professors with most of their<br />\ncolleagues somewhere in the middle. One professor<br />\nasked, \"Are we going to be stampeded into a decision by<br />\nthe students this month?\" His usage of \"stampede\" was<br />\ncontested by several of his colleagues.\"How can you say<br />\n-`stampede to a proposal that has been discussed for the<br />\nlast 20 years?' one professor asked.<br />\n<br />\nEditor's Note: What follows is a letter which a<br />\nmember of the Mechanics Department here at Hopkins<br />\nrecently sent to most members of the Homewood<br />\nFaculty, concerning calendar reform. It is printed in its<br />\nentirety, but the bold print is the N-L's. Though the<br />\nletter was not intended for undergraduate eyes, it does<br />\nseem to bring to light some fascinating ideas.<br />\nDear Colleague:<br />\nThe purpose of this letter is to draw your<br />\nattention to the considerable involvement and increasing<br />\npreoccupation of universities throughout the nation in<br />\nundergraduate activities.

Earlier this week, a substantial number of<br />\nHopkins students voted overwhelmingly for the 4-1-4 calendar proposal.<br />\nFrom what we have been able to discern, the fate of the calendar<br />\nProposal at the General Assembly seems uncertain, at best. A loud<br />\ncomplaint by many faculty members centers around the \"mini-semester.\"<br />\nProfessors claim that there is not enough evidence to* ensure that the<br />\nmini-semester will be successful and that there are too many problems as<br />\nYet to be worked out in regard to the independent study period. In effect,<br />\nthe whole proposal is being judged upon the basis of doubts raised by the<br />\n111m-semester<br />\n'<br />\nIt is obvious that there are \"unknowns\" concerning the<br />\nmini-semester. Yet, the good members of the faculty should be reminded<br />\nthat there is a factor in the educational process called \"experimentation.\"<br />\nShould the semester fail to meet up to standard, surely competent faculty<br />\nmembers and administrators, in consultation with student, could analyze<br />\nthe failings and make the necessary revisions. Or, perhaps Hopkins faculty<br />\n.d0 not feel that their students are caDable of handling the freedom<br />\nhappier and<br />\nImplicit in the mini-semester \u2014 in which case they may feel<br />\nless threatened m a high school situation, where students make fewer<br />\ndemands on their paternalistic elders.<br />\nHowever, it is unfortunate that the Student Council and<br />\nikdministration members did not take the initiative of forming more<br />\nFoncrete proposals to soothe the more nervous faculty members. We find<br />\nIt more unfortunate that the Student Council removed the pressure of a<br />\nPossible student strike in the fear that it would result in \"faculty<br />\nbacklash.\" It is high time that faculty at Hopkins, as well as<br />\nadministrators, realized that they cannot continue to pose as academic<br />\nprima donnas at the expense of the students -- who,in theory, comprise a<br />\nsubstantial part of that mythical community of scholars. Having been<br />\ndenied a voting voice in policy matters which affect the students, and<br />\n1 aving decided to drop the \"strike threat\" and continue to play the game<br />\nWithin the system,\" it would be ironic if the Student Council finds the<br />\ncalendar reform defeated by the faculty this afternoon.<br />\nIn view of the student referendum, we urge the faculty to carefully<br />\nweigh this afternoon's decision.

There was a good crowd there,<br />\nmore than I had been accustomed to seeing at<br />\nGodard's films. The audience struck me more<br />\nthan the film.<br />\nNo one would come to a Godard on an opening<br />\nnight unless they enjoyed his films and felt connected<br />\nwith what he was doing. There was a feeling of<br />\nsimpatico, a link between strangers. The audience<br />\nenjoyed the film, unconcerned with whether or not it<br />\nwould be judged \"great\" or \"mediocre,\" laughing at the<br />\nsame time, on to his little tricks and jokes.<br />\nEven with his name, Godard still has a relatively<br />\nsmall audience. He 'appeals to fewer people than<br />\nBergman or Antonioni, who despite their difficulty are<br />\nnot so Unapproachable. People mystified by a Bergman<br />\nor Antonioni film will nevertheless (usually)enjoy parts<br />\nof the film. People mystified by Godard will more than<br />\nlikely hate the whole film and the man because they<br />\naren't aware that what he is trying to do has escaped<br />\nthem. Bergman and Antonioni use their cinematic<br />\nknowledge. to reveal their personal and philosophical<br />\nexplorations. For Godard, the process is often reversed.<br />\nWhat is more important is the cinematic exploration.<br />\nHowever, to say that Godard is less concerned with<br />\ncontent than the other two would be wrong. His content<br />\nis different, and no less important.<br />\nGodard gives us little or no plot. He gives us no<br />\nreal people. They are either too two-dimensional,<br />\nabstract, or so alienated from their inner selves that they<br />\nappear completely depersonalized. The fact that they<br />\nresemble objects adds to the documentary effect he is<br />\nafter. There is nothing tragic about them for there is no<br />\nconsciousness. Without deptti, the audience cannot get<br />\nso easily involved in them, which is what Godard wants.<br />\nMeaning for Us<br />\nBy eliminating plot and empathy with the<br />\ncharacters, Godard has removed the most immediate<br />\ncrutches that films have traditionally used to carry the<br />\naudience along. With out them it is possible to see his<br />\nfilms as cold, as a didactic sequence of variations on a<br />\ntheme, as a vision of the world that holds no water, or<br />\none may approach them from a different angle. He<br />\ndemands, wjthout compromise, that we approach his<br />\nfilms in his way if they are going to have meaning for us.<br />\nHe demands that we break with our traditional frame of<br />\nreference.<br />\nGodard's cinematic ,innovations have changed<br />\nfilm-making. The hand-held camera,jump-cuts, montage<br />\ncourt, block contruction and alternation of long shots<br />\nand brief sequences are becoming (or have become) part<br />\nof many directors' methods. If one does not want from<br />\nGodard what is most frequently desired from<br />\nfilm-makers, one may find his work with the camera not<br />\njust stunning, which it often is, but as if a whole world<br />\nhad opened up. The camera, frozen at a set level, going<br />\nat the same pace from one car to the next in the great<br />\ntraffic-jam scene in Weekend, is what creates the tension<br />\nand power when one finally comes to the bodies. The<br />\ncamera in the barnyard scene, which is to many the most<br />\ntedious scene in the film, moves dispassionately around<br />\nthe whole yard, relating without emotion, the world into<br />\nwhich this fancy piano and Mozart have come.<br />\nI think that if one approaches Godard with a<br />\n\"fresh\" mind and eye, the most immediate response will<br />\nbe on a formal level. Most people want content and he is<br />\nnot going to give them that in the traditional sense. If<br />\none does not come to his films with this demand, one<br />\n<br />\nmay find what Film is \u2014 how a film is put together,<br />\nwhat one has always taken for granted in a film in order<br />\nto be carried along by the plot.<br />\nOne cannot approach Godard by looking for<br />\nwhat he is saying. If one does, his films will almost<br />\ninevitably be boring. One cannot go to find answers,<br />\nwhich seems to be in direct response to the<br />\nself-tonsciousness demanded by Bergman and<br />\nAntonioni. There are no solutions posed in Weekend.<br />\nAnd no introspection. We are presented with a sequence<br />\nof scenes built around a central idea. Some scenes are<br />\nfilmed so perfectly that they become impressive despite<br />\nth&ir brutality. The beauty that comes with perfect form<br />\nabstracts the subject matter and makes it art. (In other<br />\nwords, a scene must be ordered in some way to have<br />\nart.)<br />\nWeekend is a statement that attempts to rip the<br />\nbottom out of every aspect of life Godard can get his<br />\nhands on. It is an attempt to clear the slate. Thus, it is<br />\nalso a statement of what he has tried to do with film, to<br />\nclear away the past and create something new.<br />\nIf one comes to Godard \"fresh\" his characters<br />\nand situations may begin to live. They have the same<br />\nstark (and sometimes extraordinarily lyrical)<br />\n<br />\nabstractness of the forms of the film (shots, frames,<br />\nsequences). The relationship between the characters and<br />\nthe forms defines the relation between the characters<br />\nand the world of which they are a part, nearly always<br />\nthe bitter emptiness of a side of parisian life. The formal<br />\nexpression is equal to the content of their<br />\nGodard never lets the audience forget that his<br />\nfilms are art (noteNall the times in Weekend that the<br />\n.characters talk of their role in the movie, or face the<br />\ncamera directly and speak). When this works, a tension is<br />\ncreated between art and his documentary presentation.<br />\nTwo poles are set against each other: fiction and a<br />\ndocumentary, impersonal view of reality. Their play<br />\nagainst each other and the resulting tension is one of the<br />\nmost essential parts of Godard's method.<br />\nIt has often been pointed out that those who<br />\ndetest Godard criticize him for not doing what he<br />\nintentionally does not want to do. There is almost a<br />\ncompulsion in him to be different, to see and make<br />\nothers see in a way that breaks with what came before.<br />\nGodard is not, in his films, a deep, philosophical thinker.<br />\nHe never goes underneath like Bergman and Antonioni.<br />\nHis aim is simply to show. If they grope for answers,<br />\nGodard helps us to see the surface. On a much broader<br />\nlevel, he helps us to see, and that is a great deal.<br />\n<br />\nGuide to Re-viewing \"Weekend\"<br />\nBy CHRIS BEACH<br />\nUnless a person can sit through Weekend twice, he<br />\nhas little chance of understanding the particulars of<br />\nJean-Luc Godard's themes and cinematic devices. Yet, I<br />\nam probably addressing several people who could not<br />\nstomach two viewings of creative murder and<br />\ndestruction. (Certainly, if I suggest that Godard projects<br />\nhis vision tongue in eye socket, you might wonder if it's<br />\ngoing to be eaten along with everything else in the<br />\nmovie.)<br />\nTherefore, this review is not addressed to those of<br />\nyou who have already analyzed the movie and given it<br />\nyour individual interpretations. Rather than offering a<br />\nsecond analysis, I shall detail several aspects of the movie<br />\nwhich should be in mind when one re-views the film.<br />\nSince the producer is original in his style, if not in his<br />\ntheme, everyone should be given a chance to figure out<br />\nby himself the Godard Puzzle.<br />\nSome people argue that a movie must have an<br />\nimmediate level of meaning which discloses the artist's<br />\npurpose and point of view and that the symbolic or<br />\nsecondary levels exist only to reinforce this primary<br />\nlevel. For such people the question is: where and what is<br />\nthe first level of Godard's latest film? With this most<br />\nunusual movie the obvious is not to be found within a<br />\nsingle scene nor within the psyches of the characters. It<br />\ncannot be found anywhere within the movie itself. The<br />\napparent level exists only within the viewer's mind only<br />\nafter the movie concludes. The total effect of the film is<br />\nto shock the hell out of the indifferent, non-thinking<br />\nobserver, just as A Modest Proposal shocked the<br />\neighteenth century reader. The obvious level is the<br />\nquestion which Godard asks his viewer, ie. is Weekend a<br />\ncredible projection of the future of civilization?Those<br />\nwho reject Godard's conception of destruction as soon<br />\nas they see BLOOD and TWISTED METAL may never<br />\nbreak from their optimistic fantasies. Nor will they<br />\nrealize the mastery of Godard's cinematic style and his<br />\nanalysis of the human leech.<br />\nEats Husband<br />\nThen there are those who are intrigued enough to<br />\nsolve the complexity of Godard's vision, and they may<br />\nrelieve themselves by suffering through Weekend again.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you gutsy few submit yourself for a second or<br />\nthird or. ..time, consider the following: the plot builds<br />\nitself around man and wife who love each other only<br />\nafter they have murdered the wife's mother; before they<br />\nmurder her, they are moving or are attempting to move.<br />\ntoward Oinville, and after her funeral they seek<br />\nVersailles; the setting changes from a modern Parisian<br />\napartment to a final lovely \"pastoral\" scene\u2014in which<br />\nyou're enticed by a close-up shot of the sensuous wife<br />\neating delectable. . .husband?; time seems to be<br />\nprogressing from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon,<br />\nbut somebody keeps telling you that time has moved.<br />\nfrom Saturday at 10 A.M. through a \"Week or<br />\nThursdays\" to the \"Month of Rain\" and the \"Month of<br />\nWind\"; interrupting these movements of characters in<br />\nspace and time are the brief appearances of such beings<br />\nas Emily Bronte, God, a poet, Marx, the worm, Engels,<br />\nthe revolutionary, the garbage man, and the kid<br />\nnext-door who likes Indian costumes; throughout the<br />\nfilm you are bothered by the repetition of penetrating<br />\nviolin scratching and ariplane droning and finally, fir<br />\nrecurrence of auto wreckage, blood, dead bodies, and<br />\nflame gives you a headache' and nausea. (A more<br />\ncomprehensive list of details may reinforce the viewer's<br />\nbelief that the movie is fragmentary).<br />\nJean-Luc McLuhan<br />\nNow, if the moviegoer wishes to see these details<br />\nas parts of an integrated artistic expression, he must<br />\ninvolve himself even further. He should decide who<br />\nwithin the movie is speaking for Godard, and then, he<br />\nshould form some statement which correlates the words<br />\nof God, \"It's the end of the grammatical age.. .\"(so<br />\nthat's what McLuhan's doin'), the words of the poet as<br />\nEmily Bronte burns to ashes and the words of the<br />\nearthworm.<br />\nWhen the viewer takes these two drastic steps, he<br />\ncomes just a little bit closer to an understanding of<br />\nGodard's vision and working out the moviemaker's game<br />\nbecomes just a bit more self-satisfying. (Certainly! You<br />\nshould ask, \"Do I have to?) Afterall, what kind of idiot<br />\nwould bother to analyze and explain how Jonathan<br />\nSwift makes you laugh at a defense of cannibalism.<br />\n<br />\nCream's Turmoil Ends With ''Goodbye\"<br />\nBy JOE POTTS<br />\nSome knowledgeable detractors of Eric Clapton's technique feel<br />\nthat he is boring, that he has to rely on a certain number of riffs that he<br />\nhas down cold to sustain him through his repertoire. There are also those<br />\nwho persist in the belief that Clapton's style harks directly back to such<br />\nblues guitarists as B.B. and Albert King.<br />\nWell, let's consider a quote from Clapton from the Rolling Stone of Aug. 10,<br />\n<br />\nThe Cream: Eric Clanton, Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce.<br />\n<br />\n1968: \"I've returned to what I like doing as an individual, and that is playing<br />\nexploratory blues.\" Exploratory blues \u2014 quite the phrase.<br />\nAdmittedly, a lot of chaff has gone by in the process, like \"Dreaming\" and<br />\n\"Sleepy Time Time\" on Fresh Cream, and most of the slapped-together Disraeli<br />\nGears. With Wheels of Fire, Cream's third album, we have a complete refutation of both<br />\nof the above-mentioned accusations, as that two-record set marks the group's high<br />\nwater mark. On the studio cuts, Clapton must make great use of his eclecticism and<br />\nflexibility of style. A major reason for this is that bassist Jack Bruce wrote many of<br />\nthe songs.<br />\nTo say the least, Bruce doesn't cater to the blues idiom in his compositions, but<br />\n\u2022 tends more towards a progressive, rock type of song styling. This does not always lend<br />\nitself to Clapton's preferences. Clapton has admitted that he does not feel at home<br />\nwith either the image or the music of rock. But if it weren't for his ingenious ability to<br />\nlearn from and blend the styles of not one or two guitarists but many quite diverse<br />\ninfluences, added to his own interpretive ideas, it is doubtful that he and the rest of<br />\nCream could have achieved their considerable popularity and reasonable critical<br />\nacclaim.<br />\n(Continued on page 12)<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWSLETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAR. 14, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE I I<br />\n<br />\nStop It,Sigh,0 Please stop<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nAt the beginning of Nude Restaurant, a film by Andy<br />\nWarhol, Viva recounts some humorous incidents from her Catholic<br />\nchildhood.

The novelty of nonchalant nudity and the<br />\ngood jokes die away. Of course, we know, a Warhol film is meant to<br />\nbe boring.

It is different at the<br />\nbeginning, for no matter how<br />\nsophisticated and jaded one claims<br />\nt\u00b0 be film nudity is still a relative<br />\nnovelty.

Nothing<br />\nClapton does here is too outstanding,<br />\nbut not so with Bruce. Since the<br />\nincredible extemporaneous unity of<br />\nWheels of Fire, he seems to have become increasingly confused as to<br />\nwhat instrument he is playing and what<br />\nits role is. The bass is not a lead<br />\ninstrument, but rather one of support,<br />\nused for playing with, and not against,<br />\nthe lead instrument.<br />\nBlame Bruce<br />\nDue to this intra-group<br />\nwho's-the-greater-virtuoso dispute, it is<br />\noften quite difficult to listen to all three<br />\nof the Cream simultaneously in a live<br />\nperformance. Ginger Baker is not<br />\nentirely innocent of this egocentricity,<br />\nbut generally he does the best job of<br />\nholding everybody together. Bruce is<br />\nprimarily to blame: he should listen to<br />\nNoel Redding more often.<br />\n\"Politician\", the next cut, is also<br />\nlive, and can be taken or left. Nobody's<br />\npsyched here.<br />\nAh, but there is the second side. A<br />\nlive version of the Howlin' Wolf<br />\nstandard, \"Sitting on Top of the<br />\nWorld\", starts it off. Clapton does fine he is fast, clean, and very fancy. Bruce<br />\nbegins by thumping sympathetically<br />\nenough, but soon gets lost in the sauce,<br />\nin his own trip, doesn't always bother to<br />\ngo up or down appropriately on<br />\nchanges; i.e., he does what he damn well<br />\nwants to. Incidentally, Bruce just ain't<br />\nno blues singer, and his energetic<br />\nblustering don't cut no mustard on this<br />\ntune. A pretty nice cut, though.<br />\nSwans in the Park<br />\n<br />\nIn the translation category the<br />\nhonor was bestowed on William Weaver<br />\nfor his translation from the Italian of<br />\nCosnzocomics, a fantasy by Halo<br />\nCalvin\u00b0.<br />\n<br />\nNow come the studio songs.<br />\nClapton's \"Badge\", which he sings,<br />\nprobably won't go down in musical<br />\nhistory of a paragon of modern song<br />\nwriting, but it is certainly put down well<br />\nby the group and very enjoyable. The<br />\n<br />\nsingle vocal refrain followed by<br />\nClapton's simple, concise riff is, well,<br />\nit's whai you might call very \"tasteful.\"<br />\nHe, unlike Bruce, is definitely a blues<br />\nsinger, and even on this song, which is<br />\nnot exactly bluesy, Eric comes on<br />\nsmooth with no frills. It is very<br />\nunfortunate that he doesn't sing more<br />\noften.<br />\n\"Doing That Scrapyard Thing\" is<br />\nJack Bruce and Peter Brown's three<br />\nminute and fourteen second miscarriage<br />\nabout what \"they\" gave young Jackie at<br />\nvarious stages of his life. This one is not<br />\ndistinguished by anything except poor<br />\narranging, and that is probably due to<br />\nproducer Felix Pappalardi.<br />\nBreakup Bringdown<br />\nFaulty arrangement also mars<br />\nGinger Baker's song, \"What a<br />\nBringdown\", but the quality of the tune<br />\nshines through and, after letting it grow<br />\non you for a while, you might find it<br />\ngenuine and interesting. Where Bruce<br />\nbutts in to sing a verse seems especiallY<br />\nnoteworthy in that the song almost<br />\nassumes the bounciness of an<br />\nElizabethan galliard (dance) with<br />\nBaker's percussive dccents and Bruce<br />\ntaking the melody. We notice here that<br />\nBaker can actually sing in earnest,<br />\nunlike his previous performances on<br />\nsuch gems as \"Blue Condition\" and<br />\n\"Mother's Lament\".<br />\nWhat the hell is the matter with<br />\nthis album, anyway?It probably suffers<br />\nfrom the same afflictions \u2022 that have<br />\nplagued the Cream itself: lack of unity,<br />\ntoo much emphasis on the three<br />\nindividuals as virtuosos instead of group<br />\nmembers; and a split musical image blues on one side, rock on the other which was never successfully joined. On<br />\nwhatever side of this image the stress<br />\nwas placed, it was sure to get at least a<br />\nthird of the group's noses out of joint.<br />\nSo Cream has broken up now...a<br />\npity.

For<br />\ninstance, the passage in the Federal Constitution that<br />\nThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be<br />\nsuspended, except when in times of Invasion or<br />\nRebellion the public Safety may require it\" is modified<br />\nto the demands of Nineteenth Century orthography and<br />\nbecomes, in the Confederate constitution,\"The privilege<br />\nof the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,<br />\nexcept when in times of invasion or rebellion the public<br />\nsafety may require it.\"<br />\nIt should not be inferred, however, that in practice<br />\nthe two governments operated in a precisely similar<br />\nfashion. For instance, the Confederate Constitution<br />\nProvides for the establishment of a Supreme Court, and<br />\nsuch a body was never actually established. Obviously, a<br />\ngovernment that spent much of its short tenure in a<br />\ndesperate military struggle for existence would have<br />\nlittle time to spare for experimentation in the field of<br />\nCivil government. However, the Constitution sheds some<br />\nlight on what the Southern leaders had in mind should<br />\ntheir government ever achieve stability in a state of<br />\nPeace.<br />\nItem Veto<br />\nIt is generally known that the Constitution gave<br />\nthe Confederate president an item veto on Congressional<br />\nappropriations. This is a rather common feature of state<br />\nConstitutions. In 1952, Governor Adlai Stevenson<br />\ntestified that he had enjoyed using his item veto against<br />\nthe Illinois State Legislature and that the Confederates<br />\n<br />\nhad inspired this provision in state constitutions.<br />\nThe Confederates also restricted the President to a<br />\nsingle term of six years. Jefferson Davis' term dated<br />\nfrom his second inauguration on Washington's Birthday<br />\nof 1862; prior to that, dating back to February 18,<br />\n1861, he had been Provisional President. In 1912 a single<br />\nsix-year term for the President of the United States was<br />\nadvocated by President William Howard Taft.<br />\nThe Confederates also stipulated that their Cabinet<br />\nofficers might be granted seats in House of Congress in<br />\norder to discuss legislation in which their department<br />\nwas concerned. This was obviously an accommodation<br />\nwith the British system, in which Cabinet ministers are<br />\nsimultaneaously Members of Parliament and respond to<br />\nquestions from other Members on relevant matters.<br />\nAmendment Procedure<br />\nThere are surprisingly few restrictions on Federal<br />\npower as compared with the U.S. Constitution. It is true<br />\nthat Congress is denied an active role in amending the<br />\nConstitution. Amending proposals are initiated,<br />\naccording to the Confederates' Article V, by three state<br />\nconventions; Congress then must call into session a<br />\nconvention of all the states. If this convention, voting by<br />\nstates, ratifies the amendment, it still must be ratified by<br />\ntwo-thirds of state legislatures or state conventions.<br />\nThe Confederates met one frequent criticism of<br />\ntheir 1787 predecessors by incorporating within their<br />\nConstitution a Bill of Rights. In fact, it is almost a<br />\ncarbon copy of Amendments I-X of the Federal<br />\nConstitution. Elsewhere the Confederate Constitution<br />\nincorporates the only other U.S. Amendments up to that<br />\ntime, XI and XII.<br />\nSlavery Provisions<br />\nSlavery receives ample consideration. It is stated<br />\nthat Congress will pass no law abridging the right of<br />\nproperty in slaves, the famous three-fifths compromise is<br />\nrestated and made more explicit, and extradition is<br />\n<br />\nguaranteed even for those whose slaves lawfully go<br />\nelsewhere. The ban on importation of slaves, established<br />\nby the U.S. Congress under Constitutional authority,<br />\nwas reaffirmed. It had been enforced in the South wi,th<br />\nrigor comparable to that with which the Fugitive Slaw<br />\nLaw had been enforced in the North.<br />\nOf particular interest is the provision for<br />\nexpansion of territory, which is far more explicit than<br />\nthe comparable treatment in the U.S. Constitution.<br />\nThere had been a brisk debate on this point in Southern<br />\ncircles at the inception of the Confederacy, with some<br />\nadvocating accommodations so that Northern states<br />\nmight eventually enter the Confederacy and others, led<br />\nby South Carolina's Robert Barnwell Rhett, advocating<br />\nthat admission into the Confederacy be limited to those<br />\nwilling to conform to its institutions.<br />\nExpansion of Territory<br />\nThe final Confederate Constitution represents<br />\nsome victory for Mr. Rhea, a signer of the document. It<br />\nis stated that new states must guarantee the right of<br />\nproperty in slaves, and that applications for statehood<br />\nmust be ratified by a two-thirds' vote in both houses of<br />\nCongress. That expansion was anticipated is indicated by<br />\nthe provision that the President had to have fourteen<br />\nyears' residence in the Confederate States, not as<br />\nconstituted at the time of his residence in the<br />\nConfederate States, not as constituted at the time of his<br />\nresidence thereof, but as constituted at the time of his<br />\ninauguration.<br />\nThe modifications of the Federal Constitution in<br />\nthe Confederate Constitution are partly perfunctory,<br />\npartly implementations of the arguments for secession<br />\nand partly incorporations of experience and newer<br />\npolitical theory since 1787. There is no doubt, however,<br />\nthat the Confederate Constitution is not an original<br />\ndocument, but an adaptation of the U.S. Constitution to<br />\na somewhat different setting.<br />\n<br />\nRBRRIARRIIFIx<br />\nSTACK UP NOW \u00b0<br />\n2PRO TOOTH BRUSH \u00b0<br />\n<br />\nPutting you first, keeps us first.<br />\n<br />\nR EG. $.89 SAVE $.30\u00b0<br />\n<br />\n.100 Ul I /CI<br />\n<br />\nPAY ONLY $.59<br />\n<br />\nIREENWAY PHARMAC<br />\nCHAR1.ES & 34 STS.<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.'<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022....\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022,;;;,,,,,:,<br />\n:tx:$:,\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4 FiRRRRRFIRRZI<br />\n\"A real delight...\"*<br />\n<br />\n'Parable%<br />\n1,1 The of<br />\n)014%<br />\n<br />\nb74%,*<br />\n41i<br />\n<br />\n1\u00b0e:111111s<br />\n<br />\nc.<br />\n<br />\n14,2<br />\n<br />\nImpala Custom Coupe<br />\nequipped for trailering<br />\n<br />\nby Robert L.

The Institute is<br />\nopen only to black students and all its<br />\nfaculty members are black.<br />\nThe Institute gives courses on<br />\nblack history and psychology, Islamic<br />\nStudies, Karate, photography and radio<br />\ncommunication, among other things.<br />\nAntioch President James Dixon<br />\ntold HEW investigators of the program<br />\nthat he considers the Institute in<br />\ncompliance with the spirit of the Civil<br />\nRights Law, since the idea originated<br />\nwith the students and not with the<br />\ncollege. Antioch black students wrote to<br />\nthe agency that \"it would be a cruel<br />\njoke\" if civil rights laws which were<br />\nenacted to benefit Afro-Americans were<br />\nused to destroy the one movement that<br />\nwill most benefit Afro-Americans.\"<br />\nHEW replied by giving Antioch<br />\nuntil today to submit a desegregation<br />\nplan for the Institute. Under guidelines,<br />\nmore than $1.5 million in federal<br />\nassistance can be withdrawn from the<br />\nschool if it fails to comply.<br />\n<br />\nFor President Nixon that decision<br />\nwill be particularly hard. He is<br />\nco-chairman of the New Party and a<br />\nchampion of the black students' cause<br />\nand has been responsible for bringing<br />\nabout much of Antioch's<br />\nexperimentation and innovation.

MAR. 14. 1969<br />\n<br />\nMorgan State Hopes to Become a University<br />\nBy RICK DILLMAN<br />\nDr. . Martin D. Jenkins, President of<br />\nMorgan State College, has recommended to the<br />\nState Board of Trustees that Morgan change<br />\nfrom college to university status.<br />\nThe President's recommendation, which was<br />\nreleased earlier this year, calls for Morgan to \"be<br />\ndeveloped as a racially integrated, urban oriented<br />\nuniversity.\" The term university describes an institution<br />\nWith a complex organization comprised of several<br />\ncolleges. Recently the definition has been extended to<br />\ncover those schools which are more complex than state<br />\ncolleges, but which do not offer the higher academic<br />\ndegrees given by regular universities. The new Morgan<br />\nwould be included in this group.<br />\nAs an urban-oriented university, Morgan would be<br />\ndeveloped as \"as institution of higher education whose<br />\ntotal program is sensitive primarily to the \u2022 needs of<br />\nBaltimore City.\" It would be \"a university which will be<br />\na center for the preparation and upgrading of employees<br />\nin business<br />\nand industry and in government, educational<br />\nand community agencies;<br />\nwhich will conduct research<br />\nand project programs related to urban problems; which<br />\n'ill be a great cultural center for the people of the<br />\nCity,\"<br />\nRacially Integrated<br />\nInherent in the recommendation is the assumption<br />\nthat Morgan \"must become in the immediate future a<br />\nreally racially integrated institution\u2014and that it must<br />\nserve and<br />\nbe regarded by the people of Maryland as<br />\nserving the<br />\neducational and cultural needs of the State<br />\nWithout regard to race.\" The University, however, would<br />\nnot disregard the needs of Baltimore Negroes.\"In view<br />\n\u00b0f the probability that Baltimore will be a<br />\nPdredominantly black city, any urban university must be<br />\n\"PlY concerned with the needs of the disadvantaged<br />\nblack population.,<br />\n, President Jenkins pointed out a number of reasons<br />\ni1Y. Morgan State should assume this new responsibility.<br />\nIt is the<br />\nlargest college in the City; as a strong liberal<br />\narts college it already has the base for a university<br />\npr<br />\n\u00b0gram; its campus is large and well located; its<br />\n<br />\nprogram is already urban oriented; it has the will and<br />\nability to expand its program.\"<br />\nLooking ahead tO 1980, Dr. Jenkins criticized the<br />\nBoard of Trustees' estimate that there would be 7,000<br />\nfull time undergraduate students at Morgan by that time<br />\nas \"very conservative\". He said that although \"tkeffect<br />\nof a university organization upon enrollment cannot be<br />\naccurately predicted,\" 10,000 students would be a more<br />\nreasonable estimate. The exact enrollment would<br />\n\"depend on the admissions policy, the extent of racial<br />\nintegration and the timing of organizational details.\"<br />\nIncrease in Enrollment<br />\nThe President continued by saying that increases<br />\nin faculty and staff \"will depend more upon the increase<br />\nin enrollment than in the change to university status.\"<br />\nHe noted that a senior faculty of high quality is essential<br />\nto the effectiveness of any university. Referring to the<br />\nsaleries that would be needed to attract such a faculty,<br />\nDr. Jenkins felt that the requirements could be satisfied<br />\n\"within the framework of the faculty/salary scale for the<br />\nState Colleges by providing a sufficient number of<br />\nabove-scale salaries.\" He further emphasized that \"most<br />\nof these faculty and staff needs will exist whether or not<br />\nthe College attains university status.\"<br />\nAccording to the recommendation on the<br />\ntransition to university status would not require any<br />\ndrastic reorganization at the outset. The existing College<br />\nof Liberal Arts, the Graduate School and the Evening<br />\nDivision will be retained. The present departments of<br />\neducation, economics and business will be converted<br />\ninto colleges. The only new program will be a College of<br />\nUrban Affairs, and even this will be molded around the<br />\nexisting institutes for urban studies and political<br />\neducation.<br />\nIn discussing funding for the proposed expansion,<br />\nthe report notes that budget increases will depend more<br />\non the changes in enrollment rather than on the<br />\nachievement of university. status. \"It is difficult to<br />\nestimate increased costs due to university status per se<br />\nbecause most of the programs and services envisioned<br />\nought to be provided whether or not the College attains<br />\nuniversity status.\" The report estimates an increase of<br />\n$300,000 in appropriations over the budget for a more<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Rules Under Fire<br />\nGary St. Peter, president of Royce House<br />\nand a member of the DSRC, said that the DSRC<br />\nWill push for complete abolition of women's<br />\nvisiting rules in the dormitories at a freshman<br />\nmeeting this past Sunday in the dormitory social<br />\nlounge.<br />\nThe five other freshmen who attended the<br />\nineeting to discuss the issue of parietals agreed<br />\nWith St. Peter that unrestricted women's visiting<br />\nPrivileges are what most of the dorm residents<br />\nWant. The meeting was open to all interested<br />\ns<br />\ntudents although only a few came during the 45<br />\nminute period to give their opinions.<br />\nPossible Objections<br />\nThe students also agreed that there would<br />\nbe no real<br />\ndifficulties with full visiting privileges<br />\nand that any conflicts which arose could be<br />\nWorked out by the residents of each house. Fred<br />\n,medinger, president of the DSRC, agreed that<br />\na bolition of all restrictions would be the best<br />\nthing, but he was afraid that the administration<br />\nWould raise the possibility of roommate conflicts<br />\nas an objection to the proposal.<br />\n<br />\nSt. Peter explained that the next step in<br />\nthe process of changing the girls' rules will be to<br />\nhold a Review Board meeting to vote on the<br />\nissue. The Review Board is composed of DSRC<br />\nmembers and freshman housemasters and the<br />\nhousemasters have already promised their full<br />\nsupport for the abolition of the present<br />\nrestrictions.<br />\nMeeting Soon<br />\nThe meeting is scheduled for March 20th<br />\nand, according to St. Peter, the Review Board<br />\nshould give its full approval to the proposal with<br />\nmuch debate. He added that the final decision<br />\nwould then be up to Mr. Bilgrave.<br />\nSt. Peter concluded by saying that the<br />\nDSRC push for abolition of girls' rules might not<br />\nbe completely successful, but it should bring<br />\nabout at least some liberalizing of the present<br />\nsystem. He felt that Mr. Bilgrave might hesitate<br />\nto approve the DSRC proposal, but he would<br />\nprobably allow 48 hour weekend privileges if the<br />\nregular proposal did not go through this time.<br />\n<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br />\n<br />\nLevering Hall<br />\n<br />\nSUNDAY, MARCH 16<br />\n11 a.m. Service :<br />\n<br />\n\"BLACK RAGE\"<br />\nDr. Price M.

Amidst the various<br />\nintercollegiate teams and fervid intramural competition,<br />\nthere exists a small but dedicated sect of individual<br />\nathletes at Hopkins who find a challenge and personal<br />\nsatisfaction in such individualistic and strenuous sports as<br />\nskiing, boxing, judo, and karate. This is the story of one of<br />\nthese sports-judo, and one of its individuals - Kent Myers.<br />\nCol. Requests Article<br />\nAbout a month ago, Col. Serena approached me about the<br />\npossibility of the News-Letter featuring an article on Kent. Since<br />\nthen, in interviewing Kent, I've been asked also to put in a plug for<br />\nthe Homewood Judo Club of which Kent, holder of a first degree<br />\nblack belt in Judo (shodan), is an instructor and member.<br />\nKent first took up judo seven years ago in his home state of<br />\nColorado. Since then he has participated in three junior national<br />\njudo championships (ages 16 and younger). In 1964 in Miami Beach,<br />\nhe finished fourth. In 1965 at Chicago, he would have placed second<br />\nbut was eliminated on judo's intricate penalty point system. He won<br />\ntoo many matches by decision. In other words, he did not throw his<br />\nopponent for a full point. At Chicago, Kent had decisioned the<br />\nsecond and third place finishers before losing to the eventual grand<br />\nchampion. In his last junior national at Long Beach, California in<br />\n1966, Kent was eliminated early from serious competition, as he<br />\nfractured his right ankle and big toe.<br />\nThe following March at Las Vegas in the 1967 Senior AAU<br />\nNationals Kent broke the same ankle halfway through the<br />\ntournament. A month later he competed in a ranking tournament<br />\nbefore vowing never to compete again. After a year and a half<br />\nlay-off, Kent this past winter decided to reenter tournament<br />\ncompetition. Fitting Judo training in was further complicated by an<br />\nalready demanding schedule, for Kent is a pre-med and also Frank<br />\nComfort's number two diver on the Varsity swim team.<br />\nHas Competed in Nationals<br />\nA month ago, out in Catonsville, Kent participated in the<br />\nSouth Atlantic AAU tournament. He captured the 176 pound<br />\nweight class (although he weighs only 160) and eventually became<br />\nthe tourney's Grand Champion. A week later Kent's luck took a turn<br />\nfor the worse as his efforts to reach the nationals were squelched in<br />\nthe ShoFu Area Tournament in Arlington, Virginia with competitors<br />\nfrom N.J. to Louisiana vying for top honors. Kent was decisioned in<br />\nthe finals of this meet by a fourth degree black better. Kent says he<br />\nwill try again next year to make the nationals.<br />\nIn the meantime, Kent hopes to get enough interested Hopkins<br />\nstudents together to enter the Eastern Collegiate Judo Association<br />\n(includes, among others, Yale, Columbia, M.1.T., Maryland, West<br />\nPoint) to compete in collegiate matches.<br />\nAt present members of the Judo club work out twice a week<br />\nat the gym (Wednesdays at 7:00 and Sundays from 2:30 to 4:30).<br />\nSeveral others of this group of athletes work out at other Judo clubs<br />\nin the area during the week. Further information can be obtained<br />\nfrom Kent Meyers. For those interested in picking up judo, no<br />\nexperience is necessary. We wish Kent good luck in getting the judo<br />\nclub started and hope that next year he can go all the way to Grand<br />\nChampion in the AAU Nationals to bring another national title back<br />\nto Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\nRegular Mass Schedule<br />\nSUNDAYS ..10:30 A.M.- Shaffer Hall Rm.3<br />\nWEEKDAYS 12:05 P.M.- Levering Hall Chapel<br />\nFRIDAY - March 21st - 7:00 P.M.<br />\nLENTEN PENETENTIAL SERVICE<br />\n<br />\nheld at NEWMAN HOUSE, 2941 N.

Washington game, as playing the most<br />\nconsistent season mentally of any Hopkins team<br />\nhe has seen since the 1940's. Perhaps this is the<br />\nkey to the Blue Jay 1969 season: mental<br />\nattitude.<br />\nThe team has now won two national stick titles in<br />\na row, and last year, especially, dominated the collegiate<br />\nscene. Yet, in looking forward to the beckoning season,<br />\none must also remember the 16-14 loss to Mt.<br />\nWashington that opened last year's season. Certainly, in<br />\nView of Hopkins' record after that loss, the stick men<br />\nhad the guns to defeat the Wolfpack as their dramatic<br />\nsecond half come back illustrated.<br />\nAgain, this year, despite the graduation of several<br />\nall-Americans and three starters, the Blue Jays have the<br />\nPotential to repeat for the third time. The entire close<br />\ndefense, boasting all-Americans Mike Clark and John<br />\nCardillo, is back along with the now experienced Paul<br />\nWeiss. The Midfields are especially deep with the entire<br />\nfirst trio returning: Charlie Goodell, Phil Buck and<br />\nCharlie Coker.<br />\n<br />\nIt is probable, though, that with all-American<br />\nDowny McCarty's graduation, Charlie Coker will be<br />\nmoved to attack where he starred his freshman year, and<br />\nthat Jimmy Feely, last year a high scoring midfielder<br />\nwill take his place. To continue a Hopkins tradition, the<br />\nsecond midfield will again probably consist of three,<br />\ntough, defensive players who will surrender any ground<br />\nthey give quite grudgingly. Willie Scroggs, last year's<br />\nstandout, will anchor the trio with Steve Latson, and<br />\ntransfer student Bill Donovan.<br />\nThe third midfield is of course open to a host of<br />\ncompetitors, ranging from face off man Doug Honig who<br />\n1st midfield, to Senior John<br />\nmight even face off the<br />\nPell, Juniors Russ Moore and Andy Fischer, and sophs<br />\nJim Grenefege and Doug Fuchs.<br />\nCowan Featured<br />\n- The attack, besides Coker, will of course feature<br />\ntwo time 1st team all-American Joe Cowan. Taking Phil<br />\nKneip's place will be Junior Stu Kahl who Coach Scott<br />\nalso expects to fill in admirably for departed seniors.<br />\nSenior john Kelly will play Goal this year for the<br />\ngraduated Geoff Berlin.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, the new attack is somewhat a question<br />\nmark but Coach Scott anticipates few problems. The<br />\nteam is not as deep as in recent years, but it certainly is<br />\nvery strong with no one position glaringly inadequate.<br />\nIn addition, one is tempted to remark that<br />\nHopkins' toughest competitors are much weaker.<br />\nMaryland graduated one of its best attackman, four of<br />\nits first six middies, and lost Doug Carter, another<br />\nattackman, with injuries. Navy graduated three<br />\nall-Americans. Yet one must remember that Maryland<br />\nalways has midfielders and that their goalie,<br />\nVanDershuyt, who nearly beat the Blue Jays<br />\nsingle-handedly in the 10-8 win over Maryland, will<br />\nreturn and that Navy has several fine replacements for<br />\nboth Tamelevitch and Ogilvie.

There was, unfortunately,<br />\nconfusion between the Carlyle Barton Laboratory and the<br />\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering.<br />\nThe Carlyle Barton Laboratory is housed in Barton Hall, a<br />\nbuilding on the Homewood campus which contains, in addition to<br />\nAdministration offices and offices of faculty from several<br />\ndepartments,research facilities supported by contracts and grants.<br />\nOne of these activities is the research project called the Carlyle ,<br />\nBarton Laboratory. This laboratory does research for the Air Force!'<br />\na fraction of which is classified (less than 25%); and this is the only<br />\nclassified research in Barton Hall. Three members of the Electrical ,<br />\nEngineering Department have research contracts or grants that<br />\nsupport activities in Barton Hall. Of these three, only one is on the<br />\nstaff of the Carlyle Barton Laboratory. All of these have professorial<br />\nappointments with the Electrical Engineering Department.<br />\nBecause of an unfrotunate confusion between the Electrical<br />\nEngineering Department and the Barton Laboratory, the N-L<br />\nattributed figures given to the reporter to the Electrical Engineering<br />\nDeparrtment when, in fact, Dr. Hamburger was discussing only the<br />\nCarlyle Barton Laboratory.<br />\nHamburger further noted, in last week's article, that the<br />\nBarton Laboratozy published 23 reports, five of which were<br />\nclassified. This was mistakenly reported as relating to the Electrical<br />\nEngineering Department itself.<br />\nLast week's article indicated that a researcher in the Barton<br />\nLaboratory, working under a military contract, devoted 80% of his<br />\ntime to applied but not necessarily classified research. At least half<br />\nthat time is spent on research which is definitely not classified.

Other leading<br />\noffenders were the Needles, the Kails,<br />\nand the Klotzmans.<br />\nIn accordance with the group's<br />\nexpectations, the violations were tightlY<br />\nclustered around the Monument Street<br />\narea in the East Ghetto. These<br />\nconditions were found also to<br />\npredominate in the Western Ghetto<br />\nareas of the city.

The film, \"Off the Pig\" was<br />\nmade, in part, at the prison where Newton is presently<br />\nbeing held for the death of a policeman.<br />\nThe Cleaver interview was held before he went<br />\ninto exile to avoid imprisonment for parole violation.<br />\nThe remainder of the film showed scenes of Panther<br />\nrallies throughout the country.<br />\nBaltimore Party Chief<br />\nCaptain Warren Hart, then spoke on the principles<br />\nof the Black Panthers and the problems that are faced by<br />\nthe. revolutionary - organization in dealing with the<br />\nvarious factions of the Black community.<br />\nHe claimed that one major problem faced by the<br />\norganization is the middle-class Negroes, both in the<br />\ncommunity and in the Black colleges. Hart scorned the<br />\nMorgan State College students for having forgotten the<br />\nenvironment from ' which they came, calling them<br />\n\"middle-class niggers.\"<br />\nCaptain Hart also criticized the leaders of other<br />\nNegro organizations, referring to them as \"Uncle Toms.\"<br />\nHe added, \"The Uncle Toms have blisters on their<br /><br />\ntongues from licking boots.\" He went on to say that any<br />\ntime a man voices opposition to the \"racist system\" he<br />\n\"will have a record; not one, but fifteen or twenty<br />\narrests\".<br />\nNot Racists<br />\nExplaining that the Black Panthers are not racist<br />\nthemselves, Hart claimed that the Black community<br />\nneeds the help of the White revolutionaries. He said that<br />\nthe members of SDS are \"beautiful\" and said that with<br />\nthe continued cooperation of SDS and the Peace and<br />\nFreedom Party the movement can continue and achieve<br />\nits goals.<br />\nHart claimed that we \"have to organize a Black<br />\nrevolutionary army with the support of White<br />\nrevolutionaries.\" He emphasized that the movement<br />\nneeds the help of the Whites, saying, \"We cannot do it<br />\nalone\"<br />\nHart claimed that Baltimore is \"one of the most<br />\ncomplacent cities,\" and for that reason there is the<br />\npossibility that Eldrige Cleaver will come out of exile<br />\nhere for the purpose of stirring the community.<br />\nThe Baltimore Panther said that the reason for this<br />\ncity's lethargy is the large number of schools and<br />\nfactories in the area. He said that a large part of the<br />\nBlack community has either received so much<br />\n\"programming\" from the White school system that they<br />\ndo not revolt against it, or has comfortable jobs.<br /><br />\nCaptain Hart criticized New York's first Negro<br />\nCongresswoman, Shirley Chisolm, calling her \"a disgrace<br />\nto the Black people.\" He went on to predict that she will<br />\n\"do as much for the Black man as George Wallace does.\"<br />\nThe White establishment was warned that the<br />\nBlack Panther Party could not be stopped by \"cutting<br />\noff the heads\" of the movement. Hart claimed that the<br />\norganization had grown to such proportions that it<br />\nwould continue even if key members were eliminated.<br />\nHe went on to say that police agencies across the nation<br />\nintimidate Black Panthers constantly, but do not bother<br />\nthe reactionary organizations in the U.

He goes back to the time of Joshua to<br />\nequate an instance of the Sun standing still in the Middle East at the same time as a<br />\nperiod of prolonged darkness in the Western Hemisphere, as reported through Mexican<br />\nfolklore. This is explained by the possibility of a passing comet altering the course of<br />\nthe Earth's orbit, and thus explaining the appearance of the Sun standing still.<br />\nUntil the time of this natural phenomenon<br />\nthere were only four visible planets (Saturn,<br />\nJupitur, Mars, and Mercury), but there are no<br />\nindications of the luminous morning star, Venus.<br />\nAfter the time of Joshua there are reports of<br />\nVenus. Dr. Velikovsky claims that the formation<br />\nof Venus took place during this period, saying<br />\nthat the planet had been a comet whose orbit<br />\napproached that of the Earth closely, causing<br />\nvarious catastrophes, and had finally settled into<br />\nits present harmless orbit.<br />\nThe scientific world received the<br />\nintroduction of these extraordinary views with<br />\nvast dissaproval. Harlow Shapley, noted<br />\nastronomer, claimed, \"If Dr. Velikovsky is right,<br />\nthe rest of us are crazy\". Many of the theories<br />\nintroduced by Dr. Velikovsky both in \"Worlds in<br />\nCollision\" and succeeding works have been<br />\nproven to have some validity.<br />\nBorn in Vitebsk, Russia, in 1895, Dr.<br />\nVelikovsky received his medical education at the<br />\nUniversity of Edenburg and the University of<br />\nMoscow. He received his degree from the latter<br />\ninstitution in 1921.

In other words, a legitimate<br />\nstudent organization pressed for legitimate demands<br />\nthrough legitimate administrative channels.<br />\nIn a News-Letter of Homewood faculty opinion,<br />\nmost of those interviewed equivocated\u2014they approved of<br />\ncalendar reform in general, but objected to some aspect<br />\nof the four-one-four system in particular.<br />\nDean Swanson, while addressing the March 3rd<br />\nmeeting of the Student Council, foresaw the faculty<br />\nreaction. At the meeting, he prodded to uncover the<br />\n\"real goals\" of the Council,on the calendar reform<br />\nquestion. Would the Council settle for 1969<br />\nimplementation of portions of the four-one-four, or<br />\nelimination of the \"mini-semester\"?<br />\nThe consensus of the meeting as expressed by SC<br />\nPresident Russ Passarella was that \"the Council ought to<br />\nstand on the calendar reform as a whole.\"<br />\nHowever, Passarella has since taken note of the<br />\npossibility for a one year deferral of the \"mini-semester\"<br />\nin order to facilitate 1969 implementation of the<br />\nbalance of the calendar reform proposals.<br />\nThe charge of Dr. William Bevan's ad hoc<br />\nCommittee on the Academic Calendar (which produced<br />\nthe four-one-four recommendation) read in part: \"To<br />\nconsider the widespread undergraduate preference for a<br />\nschedule change which would (1) provide for an early<br />\ntermination date in the spring in order that they might<br />\nhave a better opportunity for summer jobs, and (2)<br />\nprovide a first term which ends at the Christmas holiday<br />\nso that the holiday could be a true one and not an<br />\nintensive study period, and which would eliminate the<br />\ngenerally unproductive two-week class period following<br /><br />\nthe Christmas holiday.\"<br />\nBevan's plan would not shorten Christmas or<br />\nsummer vacations, nor would it shorten appreciably the<br />\namount of course time that could be devoted to<br />\nteaching.<br />\nPresently each of the two semesters runs<br />\napproximately 16 weeks. Under the new proposals, each<br />\nof thellong semesters would be shortened to 14 weeks<br />\nby the abolishment of formal final examination periods.<br />\nThis is not to say that final exams will necessarily be<br />\neliminated. Their presence will remain at the discretion<br />\nof the individual faculty member.<br />\nThe abolition of formal examination periods is<br />\nessential to 1969 implementation of any variation of the<br />\nfour-one-four recommendations. However, the<br />\nMWF-TTh class scheduling recommendations which have<br />\nalso come under considerable fire are not.<br />\nThere remains a paradox. Although a major intent<br />\nof the calendar reform effort is to facilitate<br />\ninterdivisional exchanges within the university, the<br />\nadministration has also shown that it was aware of and<br />\ncared about the existence of an undergraduate program.<br />\nBut it did so without consultation of the undergraduates<br />\nthemselves, and they were to ask simply to await the<br />\nverdict of an older and wiser administration and faculty.<br />\nIt appears that it is the \"gall\" of the<br />\nundergraduates\u2014who have taken a stand on an extremely<br />\nimportant issue\u2014that irritates faculty members. It is<br />\ninteresting to note that Dr. Gordon, upon receipt of the<br />\noriginal Student Council demands, \"laughed the whole<br />\nthing off,\" until Passarella and Manuel Rodriguez<br />\nreminded him that a student strike, once begun, might<br />\nget out of hand.<br />\nIn this light, it becomes apparent that, although<br />\nthe Student Council attempted to act \"responsibly\", it<br />\nwas the threat of a \"student strike\" that motivated<br />\nadministration action. (i.e. the special meeting of the<br />\nGeneral Faculty Assembly and the inclusion of calendar<br />\nreform in the agenda of the Academic Council meeting,<br />\nscheduled for the day after Gordon received the SC's<br />\nletter).<br />\nThe mood of the administrative reaction is not<br />\nsurprising. Last year, in his address to the university Oust<br />\nprior to May exams), President Gordon reminded<br />\nstudents that if they were desirous of quality<br />\ncollege-style teaching, they should have gone to<br />\nAmherst.<br />\nHopkins administrators readily admit that the<br />\nfunction of the University lies in the realm of the<br />\n\"advancement of knowledge.\"<br />\nIn other words, the University is run for faculty,<br />\nthose students interested in research (mostly graduate<br />\nstudents), and for those undergraduates who will \"grow<br />\nup\" to advance knowledge themselves, after being<br />\nnestled in the proper environment.<br />\nDespite conjectured motives of the<br />\nadministration's actions, the fact remains that it did act,<br />\nand acted to speed consideration of the calendar reform<br /><br />\nrecommendations.<br />\nExperiences at Bennington, Reed, Smith,<br />\nDuquesne, Fordham, Oberlin, Rochester, Virginia,<br />\nWilliams, and a host of lesser-known institutions make<br />\nthe operational feasibility of the four-one-four system<br />\nbeyond question.<br />\nHowever, the advantages of the JanuarY<br />\n\"mini-semester\" have been questioned. According to Dr.<br />\nBevan, \"the January term would undoubtably mean<br />\nmore work for at least some of the faculty, but at the<br />\nsame time provide freedom for a time from the<br />\nday-to-day routines of the usual term schedule and an<br />\nopportunity to try new instructional experiments.<br />\nPerhaps the most widely scheduled activity during the<br />\nJanuary term will be independent study.\"<br />\nThe resolution of the problem of what to do with<br />\nthe \"mini-semester\" will be left to the faculty and,<br />\nhopefully, the students of the individual departments.<br />\nThus, the faculty will have a decisive voice, beyond<br />\ntoday's vote, on how they will spend their time.<br />\nThe student body could call a general strike, but<br />\nwhy should such measures be necessary\u2014in the light of<br />\nineffective undergraduate enfranchisement\u2014because the<br />\nundergraduate body must look to the faculty for<br />\nguardianship?<br />\nThe faculty, with whom lies the ultimate decision<br />\non reform, should remember to overlook personal gripes,<br />\nand vote for the benefit of the entire community. To do<br />\nso, they must, in good conscience, look to their<br />\nstudents. The Student Council referendum should<br />\nsuffice to provide the necessary counsel.<br /><br />\nDEAN SWANSON, who foresaw difficulty with the faculty.<br /><br />\nMany Professors Surveyed Indifferent to Reform<br />\nIn a N-L survey of 75<br />\nprofessors regarding the question<br />\nof calendar reform, 30.5%<br />\nindicated that they would vote in<br />\nfavor of the committee proposal<br />\nas it was submitted; 29.5% said<br />\nthey would vote no, and 40% had<br />\nmade no decision as yet.<br />\nThe survey, which was taken in<br />\nthe early part of the week, indicated<br />\nthat the proposal was, in the words of<br />\none professor, \"in for rough going.\"<br />\nMost of the objections to the report<br />\nwere directed mainly at specific<br />\nportions of the report, rather than the<br />\nreport as a whole. Over 70% of those<br /><br />\nDR. WILLIAM McELROY<br /><br />\ninterviewed were in favor of calendar<br />\nreform of some sort. Those who intend<br />\nto vote no, for the most part, will vote<br />\nno because of specific portions of the<br />\nreport which they feel they cannot live<br />\nwith.<br />\nA number of professors indicated<br />\ndisappointment with the proposed<br />\nchanges, feeling that it would still mean<br />\na variety of calendars for the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. One Faculty member<br />\nindicated, \"I am indifferent to calendar<br />\nreform. If I see that the majority of the<br />\nstudents are for the proposal then I'll<br />\nprobably vote for it.\" This seemed to<br />\nsum up the attitudes of the 21% of the<br />\nfaculty who had no opinion on the<br />\ncalendar reform issue, in general.<br />\nOpposition to the mini-semester<br />\nran strongest in the sciences, as one<br />\nfaculty member in the sciences<br />\nindicated, \"I really don't know what the<br />\nhell we are going to do with it.\"<br />\nAnother in the sciences stated, \"I am<br />\nopposed to the mini-semester because it<br />\ntakes away from a month of research<br />\nboth I and the graduate students do in<br />\nthe summer. If this month is substituted<br />\nin January, they just won't do the<br />\nresearch, but mainly try to make up a<br />\nsubject from last quarter.\" Nearly 48%<br />\nof the Faculty subscribed to this or<br />\nother arguments to voice their<br />\ndisapproval of the mini-semester. Others<br />\nproduced other reasons, such as \"extra<br />\nbureaucracy\" or \"I've taught under the<br />\nsystem and I don't like it.\"<br />\nA number of those. interviewed<br />\n,took a \"we might as well try iit\",<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nattitude, towards the 4-1-4 system with<br />\nits mini-semester. Said one faculty<br />\nmember, \"Both systems appear pretty<br />\ninefficient, but a new inefficiency will<br />\nat least be a novelty.\"<br />\nMuch of the faculty deplored the<br />\nloss of flexibility which they felt would<br />\nresult from the Monday-Wednesday-Friday class schedule. They were<br />\ngenerally split as to the academic<br />\nefficacy of one class schedule over<br />\nanother. One professor stated that<br />\nHopkins is one of the few universities<br />\nthat he knows of that has a<br />\nMonday-Tuesday-Wednesday class<br />\nsystem; \"Once you get used to it, it's<br />\nreally a much better system,\" he added.<br />\nMost of the professors who<br />\napproved of the abolishment of the final<br />\nexam period felt that it would be a step<br />\nin the direction of testing of the<br />\nstudent's true knowledge. Said one,<br />\n\"The finals now just show how a<br />\nstudent can work under stress. Many<br />\ntimes the grades of the finals do not<br />\nreflect the true knowledge of the<br />\nstudent.\" Those who opposed it did not<br />\nusually see any visable alternative to<br />\nexams for their courses, and felt that it<br />\nwould be unfair to the students to make<br />\nthem take exams during the regular class<br />\nperiod.<br />\nThe comments on the SC's actions<br />\nduring the calendar discussion ranged<br />\nfrom \"absur d\" to \"over-reacting.\"<br />\nAlmost no one felt that their actions<br />\nreally added to a resolving of the<br />\ncalendar discussion., The main point of<br />\nobjection seemed tq be the use of the<br /><br />\nword \"demand\" in the Council's<br />\nresolution: Said one Chemistry<br />\nprofessor, \"My only knowledge of the<br />\nissue comes from the N-L, and that gives<br />\nme a weak premise for the formulation<br />\nof an opinion.\"<br />\nThe Poll:<br />\n1) What is your general reaction to the<br />\ncalendar reform issue?<br />\nFavorable: 70% Unfavorable: 9% No<br />\nOpinion: 21%<br />\n2)Do you approve of the 4-1-4 system?<br />\nYes: 40% No: 33% No Opinion: 27%<br />\n3)Do you approve of the mini-semester?<br />\nYes: 35% No: 48%.No Opinion: 17%<br />\n4)Do you approve of the Monday,<br />\nWednesday, Friday, and Tuesday,<br />\nThursday class system?<br />\nYes: 32% No: 45% No Opinion: 23%<br />\n5)Do you approve of the abolishment<br />\nof the final exam period?<br />\nYes: 44% No: 35% No Opinion: 21%<br />\n6) What was your reaction to the<br />\nstudent council's approach to the<br />\ncalendar reform question?<br />\nFavorable: 25% Unfavorable: 48% No<br />\nOpinion: 27%<br />\n7)How do you intend to vote at the<br />\ngeneral assembly meeting on the 14th of<br />\nMarch?<br />\nFor: 30.5% Against: 29.5% Undecided:<br />\n40%<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI.<br />\n.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 14, 1969<br /><br />\nFaculty Discusses Calendar<br />\nBy MARK REUTTER<br /><br />\nMany faculty members were undecided as to how<br />\nthey would bote at the Assembly, maintaining that they<br />\n\"want only what the students really want.\" The S.

The professors felt that such a<br />\nsystem would unnecessarily inhibit their time, especially<br />\nFriday classes when they have weekend conferences.

Some professors believed it would take<br />\nthem some time to formulate course plans for a 4-week<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThe informal meeting also illustrated two basically<br />\nopposed camps of professors with most of their<br />\ncolleagues somewhere in the middle. One professor<br />\nasked, \"Are we going to be stampeded into a decision by<br />\nthe students this month?\" His usage of \"stampede\" was<br />\ncontested by several of his colleagues.\"How can you say<br />\n-`stampede to a proposal that has been discussed for the<br />\nlast 20 years?' one professor asked.<br /><br />\nEditor's Note: What follows is a letter which a<br />\nmember of the Mechanics Department here at Hopkins<br />\nrecently sent to most members of the Homewood<br />\nFaculty, concerning calendar reform.

This national trend may be<br />\n\u2022 inevitable and proper in large state or other public<br />\nuniversities, but it can hardly be appropriate at Johns<br />\nHopkins University, dedicated since its founding in 1876<br />\nto graduate education, research, and creative scholarship.<br />\nMainly through our involvement in undergraduate<br />\nteaching at the Homewood campus, but also through<br />\nclasses conducted in the Evening college, and as a result<br />\nof increasing demands from The School of Hygeiene and<br />\nPublic Health, and the School of Medicine we are under<br />\nconstant pressure to increase our committment to<br />\nundergraduate teaching and training programs at the<br />\ninevitable expense of our efforts in graduate and<br />\npost-graduate education. Johns Hopkins University may<br />\nhave one of the smallest undergraduate enrollments in<br />\nthe country, but our administration is forced to spend a<br />\nmajor share of its time fiddling with undergraduate<br />\naffairs even while support for graduate education and<br />\nresearch has been going up in smoke! As yet the close<br />\nties betWeen the undergraduate-administrative complex<br />\nwhich have succeeded in hampering graduate education<br />\nat other universities have not been marked here, but<br />\nthese ties appear to be increasing. On the local scene the<br />\ndecision to go ahead with an increase in undergraduate<br />\nenrollment concerns many of_ us. Already, with only<br />\n1900 undergraduates on campus a sharp increase in the<br />\nnumber of administative. positions and the<br />\naccompanying paper missiles in flight across the campus<br />\nhave increased alarmingly.<br />\nAn extraordinary meeting of the General<br />\nAssembly has been called to consider an academic<br />\ncalendar reform (4-1-4) which, while perhaps desirable,<br />\nis presented as an undergraduate demand and<br />\naccompanied by an administrative committee<br />\nrecommendation for weekly class schedule changes at<br />\nHomewood even though the committee recognizes that<br />\nunder the present schedule \"... an uninterrupted portion<br />\nof the week can be maintained for scholarly or<br />\nlaboratory research, travel, etc.\" Never mind the possible<br />\nloss to research and scholarship says the committee,<br />\nwhat if some undergraduates at Morgan State, Goucher,<br />\nor other local liberal arts college want to take some<br />\nundergraduate classes here?The changes in weekly class<br />\nschedules we propose might make it easier for them.<br />\nThese are the issues which deserve the focus of our<br />\nattention. I urge you to join me in setting aside March<br />\n17, 1969 as a day of rededication anccincreased<br />\ncommitment to graduate education, to research, and to<br />\nthe pursuit of knowledge.<br />\nYou can demonstrate your support for the March<br />\n17 research rededication by reading aloud pages 5 and 7<br />\nof_ the 1968-69 Hopkins' graduate catalogue at the<br />\nbeginning of each class, committee meeting, luncheon<br />\nmeeting, or other scheduled university function that<br />\nday.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nYou may also wish to join me in cutting out that<br />\nyour calendar and sending the \"17\" (or a<br />\non<br />\nday<br />\nreasonable facsimile) to our Academic Vice President<br />\nand Provost, Dr. Bevan, to signify your concern.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nEdwin R.

Earlier this week, a substantial number of<br />\nHopkins students voted overwhelmingly for the 4-1-4 calendar proposal.<br />\nFrom what we have been able to discern, the fate of the calendar<br />\nProposal at the General Assembly seems uncertain, at best. A loud<br />\ncomplaint by many faculty members centers around the \"mini-semester.\"<br />\nProfessors claim that there is not enough evidence to* ensure that the<br />\nmini-semester will be successful and that there are too many problems as<br />\nYet to be worked out in regard to the independent study period. In effect,<br />\nthe whole proposal is being judged upon the basis of doubts raised by the<br />\n111m-semester<br />\n'<br />\nIt is obvious that there are \"unknowns\" concerning the<br />\nmini-semester. Yet, the good members of the faculty should be reminded<br />\nthat there is a factor in the educational process called \"experimentation.\"<br />\nShould the semester fail to meet up to standard, surely competent faculty<br />\nmembers and administrators, in consultation with student, could analyze<br />\nthe failings and make the necessary revisions. Or, perhaps Hopkins faculty<br />\n.d0 not feel that their students are caDable of handling the freedom<br />\nhappier and<br />\nImplicit in the mini-semester \u2014 in which case they may feel<br />\nless threatened m a high school situation, where students make fewer<br />\ndemands on their paternalistic elders.<br />\nHowever, it is unfortunate that the Student Council and<br />\nikdministration members did not take the initiative of forming more<br />\nFoncrete proposals to soothe the more nervous faculty members. We find<br />\nIt more unfortunate that the Student Council removed the pressure of a<br />\nPossible student strike in the fear that it would result in \"faculty<br />\nbacklash.\" It is high time that faculty at Hopkins, as well as<br />\nadministrators, realized that they cannot continue to pose as academic<br />\nprima donnas at the expense of the students -- who,in theory, comprise a<br />\nsubstantial part of that mythical community of scholars. Having been<br />\ndenied a voting voice in policy matters which affect the students, and<br />\n1 aving decided to drop the \"strike threat\" and continue to play the game<br />\nWithin the system,\" it would be ironic if the Student Council finds the<br />\ncalendar reform defeated by the faculty this afternoon.<br />\nIn view of the student referendum, we urge the faculty to carefully<br />\nweigh this afternoon's decision. For the first time, calendar reform is on<br />\nthe verge of becoming reality, and the faculty should remember that there<br />\n15.no post-decision appeal available to Hopkins students if the proposal is<br />\nrejected.<br />\nOn behalf of the students, some of whom made their opinions<br />\nknown earlier this week, we urge the General Assembly to approve the<br />\ncalendar proposal of the Bevan committee.<br /><br />\nNixon on the Campus<br />\nThe Nixon Administration has finally launched its long - expected<br />\ninvasion of American colleges and universities.

On the basis of this warm<br />\ninterchange, Nixon instructed Vice President Agnew to broach the<br />\nquestion of federal intervention into campus strife at a Governor's<br />\nConference.

Affected campuses, which already<br />\nhave experienced enough racial strife, find themselves in dvise between<br />\nstudent demands and<br />\ngovernmental strictures.

There was a good crowd there,<br />\nmore than I had been accustomed to seeing at<br />\nGodard's films. The audience struck me more<br />\nthan the film.<br />\nNo one would come to a Godard on an opening<br />\nnight unless they enjoyed his films and felt connected<br />\nwith what he was doing. There was a feeling of<br />\nsimpatico, a link between strangers. The audience<br />\nenjoyed the film, unconcerned with whether or not it<br />\nwould be judged \"great\" or \"mediocre,\" laughing at the<br />\nsame time, on to his little tricks and jokes.<br />\nEven with his name, Godard still has a relatively<br />\nsmall audience. He 'appeals to fewer people than<br />\nBergman or Antonioni, who despite their difficulty are<br />\nnot so Unapproachable. People mystified by a Bergman<br />\nor Antonioni film will nevertheless (usually)enjoy parts<br />\nof the film. People mystified by Godard will more than<br />\nlikely hate the whole film and the man because they<br />\naren't aware that what he is trying to do has escaped<br />\nthem. Bergman and Antonioni use their cinematic<br />\nknowledge. to reveal their personal and philosophical<br />\nexplorations. For Godard, the process is often reversed.<br />\nWhat is more important is the cinematic exploration.<br />\nHowever, to say that Godard is less concerned with<br />\ncontent than the other two would be wrong. His content<br />\nis different, and no less important.<br />\nGodard gives us little or no plot. He gives us no<br />\nreal people. They are either too two-dimensional,<br />\nabstract, or so alienated from their inner selves that they<br />\nappear completely depersonalized. The fact that they<br />\nresemble objects adds to the documentary effect he is<br />\nafter. There is nothing tragic about them for there is no<br />\nconsciousness. Without deptti, the audience cannot get<br />\nso easily involved in them, which is what Godard wants.<br />\nMeaning for Us<br />\nBy eliminating plot and empathy with the<br />\ncharacters, Godard has removed the most immediate<br />\ncrutches that films have traditionally used to carry the<br />\naudience along. With out them it is possible to see his<br />\nfilms as cold, as a didactic sequence of variations on a<br />\ntheme, as a vision of the world that holds no water, or<br />\none may approach them from a different angle. He<br />\ndemands, wjthout compromise, that we approach his<br />\nfilms in his way if they are going to have meaning for us.<br />\nHe demands that we break with our traditional frame of<br />\nreference.<br />\nGodard's cinematic ,innovations have changed<br />\nfilm-making. The hand-held camera,jump-cuts, montage<br />\ncourt, block contruction and alternation of long shots<br />\nand brief sequences are becoming (or have become) part<br />\nof many directors' methods. If one does not want from<br />\nGodard what is most frequently desired from<br />\nfilm-makers, one may find his work with the camera not<br />\njust stunning, which it often is, but as if a whole world<br />\nhad opened up. The camera, frozen at a set level, going<br />\nat the same pace from one car to the next in the great<br />\ntraffic-jam scene in Weekend, is what creates the tension<br />\nand power when one finally comes to the bodies. The<br />\ncamera in the barnyard scene, which is to many the most<br />\ntedious scene in the film, moves dispassionately around<br />\nthe whole yard, relating without emotion, the world into<br />\nwhich this fancy piano and Mozart have come.<br />\nI think that if one approaches Godard with a<br />\n\"fresh\" mind and eye, the most immediate response will<br />\nbe on a formal level. Most people want content and he is<br />\nnot going to give them that in the traditional sense. If<br />\none does not come to his films with this demand, one<br /><br />\nmay find what Film is \u2014 how a film is put together,<br />\nwhat one has always taken for granted in a film in order<br />\nto be carried along by the plot.<br />\nOne cannot approach Godard by looking for<br />\nwhat he is saying. If one does, his films will almost<br />\ninevitably be boring. One cannot go to find answers,<br />\nwhich seems to be in direct response to the<br />\nself-tonsciousness demanded by Bergman and<br />\nAntonioni. There are no solutions posed in Weekend.<br />\nAnd no introspection. We are presented with a sequence<br />\nof scenes built around a central idea. Some scenes are<br />\nfilmed so perfectly that they become impressive despite<br />\nth&amp;ir brutality. The beauty that comes with perfect form<br />\nabstracts the subject matter and makes it art. (In other<br />\nwords, a scene must be ordered in some way to have<br />\nart.)<br />\nWeekend is a statement that attempts to rip the<br />\nbottom out of every aspect of life Godard can get his<br />\nhands on. It is an attempt to clear the slate. Thus, it is<br />\nalso a statement of what he has tried to do with film, to<br />\nclear away the past and create something new.<br />\nIf one comes to Godard \"fresh\" his characters<br />\nand situations may begin to live. They have the same<br />\nstark (and sometimes extraordinarily lyrical)<br /><br />\nabstractness of the forms of the film (shots, frames,<br />\nsequences). The relationship between the characters and<br />\nthe forms defines the relation between the characters<br />\nand the world of which they are a part, nearly always<br />\nthe bitter emptiness of a side of parisian life. The formal<br />\nexpression is equal to the content of their<br />\nGodard never lets the audience forget that his<br />\nfilms are art (noteNall the times in Weekend that the<br />\n.characters talk of their role in the movie, or face the<br />\ncamera directly and speak). When this works, a tension is<br />\ncreated between art and his documentary presentation.<br />\nTwo poles are set against each other: fiction and a<br />\ndocumentary, impersonal view of reality. Their play<br />\nagainst each other and the resulting tension is one of the<br />\nmost essential parts of Godard's method.<br />\nIt has often been pointed out that those who<br />\ndetest Godard criticize him for not doing what he<br />\nintentionally does not want to do. There is almost a<br />\ncompulsion in him to be different, to see and make<br />\nothers see in a way that breaks with what came before.<br />\nGodard is not, in his films, a deep, philosophical thinker.<br />\nHe never goes underneath like Bergman and Antonioni.<br />\nHis aim is simply to show. If they grope for answers,<br />\nGodard helps us to see the surface. On a much broader<br />\nlevel, he helps us to see, and that is a great deal.<br /><br />\nGuide to Re-viewing \"Weekend\"<br />\nBy CHRIS BEACH<br />\nUnless a person can sit through Weekend twice, he<br />\nhas little chance of understanding the particulars of<br />\nJean-Luc Godard's themes and cinematic devices. Yet, I<br />\nam probably addressing several people who could not<br />\nstomach two viewings of creative murder and<br />\ndestruction. (Certainly, if I suggest that Godard projects<br />\nhis vision tongue in eye socket, you might wonder if it's<br />\ngoing to be eaten along with everything else in the<br />\nmovie.)<br />\nTherefore, this review is not addressed to those of<br />\nyou who have already analyzed the movie and given it<br />\nyour individual interpretations. Rather than offering a<br />\nsecond analysis, I shall detail several aspects of the movie<br />\nwhich should be in mind when one re-views the film.<br />\nSince the producer is original in his style, if not in his<br />\ntheme, everyone should be given a chance to figure out<br />\nby himself the Godard Puzzle.<br />\nSome people argue that a movie must have an<br />\nimmediate level of meaning which discloses the artist's<br />\npurpose and point of view and that the symbolic or<br />\nsecondary levels exist only to reinforce this primary<br />\nlevel. For such people the question is: where and what is<br />\nthe first level of Godard's latest film? With this most<br />\nunusual movie the obvious is not to be found within a<br />\nsingle scene nor within the psyches of the characters. It<br />\ncannot be found anywhere within the movie itself. The<br />\napparent level exists only within the viewer's mind only<br />\nafter the movie concludes. The total effect of the film is<br />\nto shock the hell out of the indifferent, non-thinking<br />\nobserver, just as A Modest Proposal shocked the<br />\neighteenth century reader. The obvious level is the<br />\nquestion which Godard asks his viewer, ie. is Weekend a<br />\ncredible projection of the future of civilization?Those<br />\nwho reject Godard's conception of destruction as soon<br />\nas they see BLOOD and TWISTED METAL may never<br />\nbreak from their optimistic fantasies. Nor will they<br />\nrealize the mastery of Godard's cinematic style and his<br />\nanalysis of the human leech.<br />\nEats Husband<br />\nThen there are those who are intrigued enough to<br />\nsolve the complexity of Godard's vision, and they may<br />\nrelieve themselves by suffering through Weekend again.<br /><br />\nWhen you gutsy few submit yourself for a second or<br />\nthird or. ..time, consider the following: the plot builds<br />\nitself around man and wife who love each other only<br />\nafter they have murdered the wife's mother; before they<br />\nmurder her, they are moving or are attempting to move.<br />\ntoward Oinville, and after her funeral they seek<br />\nVersailles; the setting changes from a modern Parisian<br />\napartment to a final lovely \"pastoral\" scene\u2014in which<br />\nyou're enticed by a close-up shot of the sensuous wife<br />\neating delectable. . .husband?; time seems to be<br />\nprogressing from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon,<br />\nbut somebody keeps telling you that time has moved.<br />\nfrom Saturday at 10 A.M. through a \"Week or<br />\nThursdays\" to the \"Month of Rain\" and the \"Month of<br />\nWind\"; interrupting these movements of characters in<br />\nspace and time are the brief appearances of such beings<br />\nas Emily Bronte, God, a poet, Marx, the worm, Engels,<br />\nthe revolutionary, the garbage man, and the kid<br />\nnext-door who likes Indian costumes; throughout the<br />\nfilm you are bothered by the repetition of penetrating<br />\nviolin scratching and ariplane droning and finally, fir<br />\nrecurrence of auto wreckage, blood, dead bodies, and<br />\nflame gives you a headache' and nausea. (A more<br />\ncomprehensive list of details may reinforce the viewer's<br />\nbelief that the movie is fragmentary).<br />\nJean-Luc McLuhan<br />\nNow, if the moviegoer wishes to see these details<br />\nas parts of an integrated artistic expression, he must<br />\ninvolve himself even further. He should decide who<br />\nwithin the movie is speaking for Godard, and then, he<br />\nshould form some statement which correlates the words<br />\nof God, \"It's the end of the grammatical age.. .\"(so<br />\nthat's what McLuhan's doin'), the words of the poet as<br />\nEmily Bronte burns to ashes and the words of the<br />\nearthworm.<br />\nWhen the viewer takes these two drastic steps, he<br />\ncomes just a little bit closer to an understanding of<br />\nGodard's vision and working out the moviemaker's game<br />\nbecomes just a bit more self-satisfying. (Certainly! You<br />\nshould ask, \"Do I have to?) Afterall, what kind of idiot<br />\nwould bother to analyze and explain how Jonathan<br />\nSwift makes you laugh at a defense of cannibalism.<br /><br />\nCream's Turmoil Ends With ''Goodbye\"<br />\nBy JOE POTTS<br />\nSome knowledgeable detractors of Eric Clapton's technique feel<br />\nthat he is boring, that he has to rely on a certain number of riffs that he<br />\nhas down cold to sustain him through his repertoire. There are also those<br />\nwho persist in the belief that Clapton's style harks directly back to such<br />\nblues guitarists as B.B. and Albert King.<br />\nWell, let's consider a quote from Clapton from the Rolling Stone of Aug. 10,<br /><br />\nThe Cream: Eric Clanton, Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce.<br /><br />\n1968: \"I've returned to what I like doing as an individual, and that is playing<br />\nexploratory blues.\" Exploratory blues \u2014 quite the phrase.<br />\nAdmittedly, a lot of chaff has gone by in the process, like \"Dreaming\" and<br />\n\"Sleepy Time Time\" on Fresh Cream, and most of the slapped-together Disraeli<br />\nGears. With Wheels of Fire, Cream's third album, we have a complete refutation of both<br />\nof the above-mentioned accusations, as that two-record set marks the group's high<br />\nwater mark. On the studio cuts, Clapton must make great use of his eclecticism and<br />\nflexibility of style. A major reason for this is that bassist Jack Bruce wrote many of<br />\nthe songs.<br />\nTo say the least, Bruce doesn't cater to the blues idiom in his compositions, but<br />\n\u2022 tends more towards a progressive, rock type of song styling. This does not always lend<br />\nitself to Clapton's preferences. Clapton has admitted that he does not feel at home<br />\nwith either the image or the music of rock. But if it weren't for his ingenious ability to<br />\nlearn from and blend the styles of not one or two guitarists but many quite diverse<br />\ninfluences, added to his own interpretive ideas, it is doubtful that he and the rest of<br />\nCream could have achieved their considerable popularity and reasonable critical<br />\nacclaim.<br />\n(Continued on page 12)<br /><br />\nNEWSLETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAR. 14, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE I I<br /><br />\nStop It,Sigh,0 Please stop<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nAt the beginning of Nude Restaurant, a film by Andy<br />\nWarhol, Viva recounts some humorous incidents from her Catholic<br />\nchildhood.

The novelty of nonchalant nudity and the<br />\ngood jokes die away. Of course, we know, a Warhol film is meant to<br />\nbe boring.

The scene is just a common ordinary garden variety restaurant<br />\npatronized by freaks, who play guitar, dance, have immeasurable<br />\ndifficulty ordering a ham and cheese sandwich, or tickle each other's<br />\nnipples. But mostly they talk, mostly in monologues, mostly<br />\nconsisting of jokes.<br />\nWarhol has presented us with an Ed Sullivan show of the<br />\nEast Village, and Viva and Taylor Mead in place of Totie Fields and<br />\n13111 Cosby. They tell stories and anecdotes from childhood days and<br />\nLife With Father.<br />\nBut, predictably, hippies,<br />\nsa.do-masochism, and repressed<br />\nPriests are substituted for Jewish<br />\nmother-in-laws, softball, and Fat<br />\nAlbert.

It is different at the<br />\nbeginning, for no matter how<br />\nsophisticated and jaded one claims<br />\nt\u00b0 be film nudity is still a relative<br />\nnovelty.

Nothing<br />\nClapton does here is too outstanding,<br />\nbut not so with Bruce. Since the<br />\nincredible extemporaneous unity of<br />\nWheels of Fire, he seems to have become increasingly confused as to<br />\nwhat instrument he is playing and what<br />\nits role is. The bass is not a lead<br />\ninstrument, but rather one of support,<br />\nused for playing with, and not against,<br />\nthe lead instrument.<br />\nBlame Bruce<br />\nDue to this intra-group<br />\nwho's-the-greater-virtuoso dispute, it is<br />\noften quite difficult to listen to all three<br />\nof the Cream simultaneously in a live<br />\nperformance. Ginger Baker is not<br />\nentirely innocent of this egocentricity,<br />\nbut generally he does the best job of<br />\nholding everybody together. Bruce is<br />\nprimarily to blame: he should listen to<br />\nNoel Redding more often.<br />\n\"Politician\", the next cut, is also<br />\nlive, and can be taken or left. Nobody's<br />\npsyched here.<br />\nAh, but there is the second side. A<br />\nlive version of the Howlin' Wolf<br />\nstandard, \"Sitting on Top of the<br />\nWorld\", starts it off. Clapton does fine he is fast, clean, and very fancy. Bruce<br />\nbegins by thumping sympathetically<br />\nenough, but soon gets lost in the sauce,<br />\nin his own trip, doesn't always bother to<br />\ngo up or down appropriately on<br />\nchanges; i.e., he does what he damn well<br />\nwants to. Incidentally, Bruce just ain't<br />\nno blues singer, and his energetic<br />\nblustering don't cut no mustard on this<br />\ntune. A pretty nice cut, though.<br />\nSwans in the Park<br /><br />\nIn the translation category the<br />\nhonor was bestowed on William Weaver<br />\nfor his translation from the Italian of<br />\nCosnzocomics, a fantasy by Halo<br />\nCalvin\u00b0.<br /><br />\nNow come the studio songs.<br />\nClapton's \"Badge\", which he sings,<br />\nprobably won't go down in musical<br />\nhistory of a paragon of modern song<br />\nwriting, but it is certainly put down well<br />\nby the group and very enjoyable. The<br /><br />\nsingle vocal refrain followed by<br />\nClapton's simple, concise riff is, well,<br />\nit's whai you might call very \"tasteful.\"<br />\nHe, unlike Bruce, is definitely a blues<br />\nsinger, and even on this song, which is<br />\nnot exactly bluesy, Eric comes on<br />\nsmooth with no frills. It is very<br />\nunfortunate that he doesn't sing more<br />\noften.<br />\n\"Doing That Scrapyard Thing\" is<br />\nJack Bruce and Peter Brown's three<br />\nminute and fourteen second miscarriage<br />\nabout what \"they\" gave young Jackie at<br />\nvarious stages of his life. This one is not<br />\ndistinguished by anything except poor<br />\narranging, and that is probably due to<br />\nproducer Felix Pappalardi.<br />\nBreakup Bringdown<br />\nFaulty arrangement also mars<br />\nGinger Baker's song, \"What a<br />\nBringdown\", but the quality of the tune<br />\nshines through and, after letting it grow<br />\non you for a while, you might find it<br />\ngenuine and interesting. Where Bruce<br />\nbutts in to sing a verse seems especiallY<br />\nnoteworthy in that the song almost<br />\nassumes the bounciness of an<br />\nElizabethan galliard (dance) with<br />\nBaker's percussive dccents and Bruce<br />\ntaking the melody. We notice here that<br />\nBaker can actually sing in earnest,<br />\nunlike his previous performances on<br />\nsuch gems as \"Blue Condition\" and<br />\n\"Mother's Lament\".<br />\nWhat the hell is the matter with<br />\nthis album, anyway?It probably suffers<br />\nfrom the same afflictions \u2022 that have<br />\nplagued the Cream itself: lack of unity,<br />\ntoo much emphasis on the three<br />\nindividuals as virtuosos instead of group<br />\nmembers; and a split musical image blues on one side, rock on the other which was never successfully joined. On<br />\nwhatever side of this image the stress<br />\nwas placed, it was sure to get at least a<br />\nthird of the group's noses out of joint.<br />\nSo Cream has broken up now...a<br />\npity.

For<br />\ninstance, the passage in the Federal Constitution that<br />\nThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be<br />\nsuspended, except when in times of Invasion or<br />\nRebellion the public Safety may require it\" is modified<br />\nto the demands of Nineteenth Century orthography and<br />\nbecomes, in the Confederate constitution,\"The privilege<br />\nof the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,<br />\nexcept when in times of invasion or rebellion the public<br />\nsafety may require it.\"<br />\nIt should not be inferred, however, that in practice<br />\nthe two governments operated in a precisely similar<br />\nfashion. For instance, the Confederate Constitution<br />\nProvides for the establishment of a Supreme Court, and<br />\nsuch a body was never actually established. Obviously, a<br />\ngovernment that spent much of its short tenure in a<br />\ndesperate military struggle for existence would have<br />\nlittle time to spare for experimentation in the field of<br />\nCivil government. However, the Constitution sheds some<br />\nlight on what the Southern leaders had in mind should<br />\ntheir government ever achieve stability in a state of<br />\nPeace.<br />\nItem Veto<br />\nIt is generally known that the Constitution gave<br />\nthe Confederate president an item veto on Congressional<br />\nappropriations. This is a rather common feature of state<br />\nConstitutions. In 1952, Governor Adlai Stevenson<br />\ntestified that he had enjoyed using his item veto against<br />\nthe Illinois State Legislature and that the Confederates<br /><br />\nhad inspired this provision in state constitutions.<br />\nThe Confederates also restricted the President to a<br />\nsingle term of six years. Jefferson Davis' term dated<br />\nfrom his second inauguration on Washington's Birthday<br />\nof 1862; prior to that, dating back to February 18,<br />\n1861, he had been Provisional President. In 1912 a single<br />\nsix-year term for the President of the United States was<br />\nadvocated by President William Howard Taft.<br />\nThe Confederates also stipulated that their Cabinet<br />\nofficers might be granted seats in House of Congress in<br />\norder to discuss legislation in which their department<br />\nwas concerned. This was obviously an accommodation<br />\nwith the British system, in which Cabinet ministers are<br />\nsimultaneaously Members of Parliament and respond to<br />\nquestions from other Members on relevant matters.<br />\nAmendment Procedure<br />\nThere are surprisingly few restrictions on Federal<br />\npower as compared with the U.S. Constitution. It is true<br />\nthat Congress is denied an active role in amending the<br />\nConstitution. Amending proposals are initiated,<br />\naccording to the Confederates' Article V, by three state<br />\nconventions; Congress then must call into session a<br />\nconvention of all the states. If this convention, voting by<br />\nstates, ratifies the amendment, it still must be ratified by<br />\ntwo-thirds of state legislatures or state conventions.<br />\nThe Confederates met one frequent criticism of<br />\ntheir 1787 predecessors by incorporating within their<br />\nConstitution a Bill of Rights. In fact, it is almost a<br />\ncarbon copy of Amendments I-X of the Federal<br />\nConstitution. Elsewhere the Confederate Constitution<br />\nincorporates the only other U.S. Amendments up to that<br />\ntime, XI and XII.<br />\nSlavery Provisions<br />\nSlavery receives ample consideration. It is stated<br />\nthat Congress will pass no law abridging the right of<br />\nproperty in slaves, the famous three-fifths compromise is<br />\nrestated and made more explicit, and extradition is<br /><br />\nguaranteed even for those whose slaves lawfully go<br />\nelsewhere. The ban on importation of slaves, established<br />\nby the U.S. Congress under Constitutional authority,<br />\nwas reaffirmed. It had been enforced in the South wi,th<br />\nrigor comparable to that with which the Fugitive Slaw<br />\nLaw had been enforced in the North.<br />\nOf particular interest is the provision for<br />\nexpansion of territory, which is far more explicit than<br />\nthe comparable treatment in the U.S. Constitution.<br />\nThere had been a brisk debate on this point in Southern<br />\ncircles at the inception of the Confederacy, with some<br />\nadvocating accommodations so that Northern states<br />\nmight eventually enter the Confederacy and others, led<br />\nby South Carolina's Robert Barnwell Rhett, advocating<br />\nthat admission into the Confederacy be limited to those<br />\nwilling to conform to its institutions.<br />\nExpansion of Territory<br />\nThe final Confederate Constitution represents<br />\nsome victory for Mr. Rhea, a signer of the document. It<br />\nis stated that new states must guarantee the right of<br />\nproperty in slaves, and that applications for statehood<br />\nmust be ratified by a two-thirds' vote in both houses of<br />\nCongress. That expansion was anticipated is indicated by<br />\nthe provision that the President had to have fourteen<br />\nyears' residence in the Confederate States, not as<br />\nconstituted at the time of his residence in the<br />\nConfederate States, not as constituted at the time of his<br />\nresidence thereof, but as constituted at the time of his<br />\ninauguration.<br />\nThe modifications of the Federal Constitution in<br />\nthe Confederate Constitution are partly perfunctory,<br />\npartly implementations of the arguments for secession<br />\nand partly incorporations of experience and newer<br />\npolitical theory since 1787. There is no doubt, however,<br />\nthat the Confederate Constitution is not an original<br />\ndocument, but an adaptation of the U.S. Constitution to<br />\na somewhat different setting.<br /><br />\nRBRRIARRIIFIx<br />\nSTACK UP NOW \u00b0<br />\n2PRO TOOTH BRUSH \u00b0<br /><br />\nPutting you first, keeps us first.<br /><br />\nR EG. $.89 SAVE $.30\u00b0<br /><br />\n.100 Ul I /CI<br /><br />\nPAY ONLY $.59<br /><br />\nIREENWAY PHARMAC<br />\nCHAR1.ES &amp; 34 STS.<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n.'<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022....\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022,;;;,,,,,:,<br />\n:tx:$:,\u2022<br /><br />\n4 FiRRRRRFIRRZI<br />\n\"A real delight...\"*<br /><br />\n'Parable%<br />\n1,1 The of<br />\n)014%<br /><br />\nb74%,*<br />\n41i<br /><br />\n1\u00b0e:111111s<br /><br />\nc.<br /><br />\n14,2<br /><br />\nImpala Custom Coupe<br />\nequipped for trailering<br /><br />\nby Robert L.

He<br />\nfelt control should be maintained in the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nIdeological Difference<br />\nMrs. Wedel felt there was a<br />\n\"fundamental ideological difference<br />\nbetween those who felt the ideal was<br />\neach person free to pursue what he is<br />\ninterested in and those who felt<br />\n\"creativity and innovation is fostered by<br />\ncommunity interaction and discussion.\"<br />\nSince no substantive decision<br />\ncould be made, a three-man committee<br /><br />\nOne seminar has since been held<br />\nand the reaction has been very favorable<br />\naccording to Mrs. Wedel and Mr.<br />\nForman.

Mrs. Wedel said she suggested<br />\ngeneral seminar meetings at which<br />\nstudents and faculty would report on<br />\nresearch and that \"Dr. Rourke<br />\nimplemented the proposal that same<br />\nafternoon.\" She said he appeared<br />\n\"concerned about the program's<br />\npossible snuffing out of creativity.\"<br /><br />\nHEW Equates 'Autonomy'<br />\nWith Black Segregation<br />\n(Continued from page 6)<br /><br />\ndesegregated or colleges will face less<br />\nfederal funds.<br />\nThe first college hit by the new<br />\nruling is Antioch in Ohio, which has an<br />\nAfro-American Studies Institute and an<br />\nall-black dormitory. The Institute is<br />\nopen only to black students and all its<br />\nfaculty members are black.<br />\nThe Institute gives courses on<br />\nblack history and psychology, Islamic<br />\nStudies, Karate, photography and radio<br />\ncommunication, among other things.<br />\nAntioch President James Dixon<br />\ntold HEW investigators of the program<br />\nthat he considers the Institute in<br />\ncompliance with the spirit of the Civil<br />\nRights Law, since the idea originated<br />\nwith the students and not with the<br />\ncollege. Antioch black students wrote to<br />\nthe agency that \"it would be a cruel<br />\njoke\" if civil rights laws which were<br />\nenacted to benefit Afro-Americans were<br />\nused to destroy the one movement that<br />\nwill most benefit Afro-Americans.\"<br />\nHEW replied by giving Antioch<br />\nuntil today to submit a desegregation<br />\nplan for the Institute. Under guidelines,<br />\nmore than $1.5 million in federal<br />\nassistance can be withdrawn from the<br />\nschool if it fails to comply.<br /><br />\nFor President Nixon that decision<br />\nwill be particularly hard. He is<br />\nco-chairman of the New Party and a<br />\nchampion of the black students' cause<br />\nand has been responsible for bringing<br />\nabout much of Antioch's<br />\nexperimentation and innovation. But,<br />\nlike most schools, Antioch is<br />\nhard-pressed financially and, as Nixon'<br />\nsays, \"it would be very difficult to do<br />\nwithout that federal money.\"<br />\nHEW equates the word<br />\n\"autonomous\" as applied to black<br />\nstudies programs with \"segregated.\" The<br />\nword, which appears often in black<br />\nstudents' demands at such schools as<br />\nSan Francisco State College, Queens<br />\nCollege, Duke University and Brandeis<br />\nUniversity, sometimes means \"black<br />\nonly.\" In other places it means thq<br />\nstudents want community leaders<br />\nbrought into the planning and placed on<br />\nthe control agencies or it means they<br />\nwant a voice in the decisions about the<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nIn a memorandum which will<br />\nsoon be sent to every college and<br />\nuniversity president in the country,<br />\nHEW will warn that \"autonomous\"<br />\nblack studies programs must be<br /><br />\n(Continued from page 6)<br /><br />\ndemanded a ban on all rallies and<br />\nremoval of all strikers from the campus.<br />\nHeyns has also been criticized by Sheriff<br />\nFrank Madigan of Alameda County,<br />\nwhere Berkely is located.<br />\nThe crackdown means more than<br />\npolice beating demonstrators.

MAR. 14. 1969<br /><br />\nMorgan State Hopes to Become a University<br />\nBy RICK DILLMAN<br />\nDr. . Martin D. Jenkins, President of<br />\nMorgan State College, has recommended to the<br />\nState Board of Trustees that Morgan change<br />\nfrom college to university status.<br />\nThe President's recommendation, which was<br />\nreleased earlier this year, calls for Morgan to \"be<br />\ndeveloped as a racially integrated, urban oriented<br />\nuniversity.\" The term university describes an institution<br />\nWith a complex organization comprised of several<br />\ncolleges. Recently the definition has been extended to<br />\ncover those schools which are more complex than state<br />\ncolleges, but which do not offer the higher academic<br />\ndegrees given by regular universities. The new Morgan<br />\nwould be included in this group.<br />\nAs an urban-oriented university, Morgan would be<br />\ndeveloped as \"as institution of higher education whose<br />\ntotal program is sensitive primarily to the \u2022 needs of<br />\nBaltimore City.\" It would be \"a university which will be<br />\na center for the preparation and upgrading of employees<br />\nin business<br />\nand industry and in government, educational<br />\nand community agencies;<br />\nwhich will conduct research<br />\nand project programs related to urban problems; which<br />\n'ill be a great cultural center for the people of the<br />\nCity,\"<br />\nRacially Integrated<br />\nInherent in the recommendation is the assumption<br />\nthat Morgan \"must become in the immediate future a<br />\nreally racially integrated institution\u2014and that it must<br />\nserve and<br />\nbe regarded by the people of Maryland as<br />\nserving the<br />\neducational and cultural needs of the State<br />\nWithout regard to race.\" The University, however, would<br />\nnot disregard the needs of Baltimore Negroes.\"In view<br />\n\u00b0f the probability that Baltimore will be a<br />\nPdredominantly black city, any urban university must be<br />\n\"PlY concerned with the needs of the disadvantaged<br />\nblack population.,<br />\n, President Jenkins pointed out a number of reasons<br />\ni1Y. Morgan State should assume this new responsibility.<br />\nIt is the<br />\nlargest college in the City; as a strong liberal<br />\narts college it already has the base for a university<br />\npr<br />\n\u00b0gram; its campus is large and well located; its<br /><br />\nprogram is already urban oriented; it has the will and<br />\nability to expand its program.\"<br />\nLooking ahead tO 1980, Dr. Jenkins criticized the<br />\nBoard of Trustees' estimate that there would be 7,000<br />\nfull time undergraduate students at Morgan by that time<br />\nas \"very conservative\". He said that although \"tkeffect<br />\nof a university organization upon enrollment cannot be<br />\naccurately predicted,\" 10,000 students would be a more<br />\nreasonable estimate. The exact enrollment would<br />\n\"depend on the admissions policy, the extent of racial<br />\nintegration and the timing of organizational details.\"<br />\nIncrease in Enrollment<br />\nThe President continued by saying that increases<br />\nin faculty and staff \"will depend more upon the increase<br />\nin enrollment than in the change to university status.\"<br />\nHe noted that a senior faculty of high quality is essential<br />\nto the effectiveness of any university. Referring to the<br />\nsaleries that would be needed to attract such a faculty,<br />\nDr. Jenkins felt that the requirements could be satisfied<br />\n\"within the framework of the faculty/salary scale for the<br />\nState Colleges by providing a sufficient number of<br />\nabove-scale salaries.\" He further emphasized that \"most<br />\nof these faculty and staff needs will exist whether or not<br />\nthe College attains university status.\"<br />\nAccording to the recommendation on the<br />\ntransition to university status would not require any<br />\ndrastic reorganization at the outset. The existing College<br />\nof Liberal Arts, the Graduate School and the Evening<br />\nDivision will be retained. The present departments of<br />\neducation, economics and business will be converted<br />\ninto colleges. The only new program will be a College of<br />\nUrban Affairs, and even this will be molded around the<br />\nexisting institutes for urban studies and political<br />\neducation.<br />\nIn discussing funding for the proposed expansion,<br />\nthe report notes that budget increases will depend more<br />\non the changes in enrollment rather than on the<br />\nachievement of university. status. \"It is difficult to<br />\nestimate increased costs due to university status per se<br />\nbecause most of the programs and services envisioned<br />\nought to be provided whether or not the College attains<br />\nuniversity status.\" The report estimates an increase of<br />\n$300,000 in appropriations over the budget for a more<br /><br />\nWomen's Rules Under Fire<br />\nGary St. Peter, president of Royce House<br />\nand a member of the DSRC, said that the DSRC<br />\nWill push for complete abolition of women's<br />\nvisiting rules in the dormitories at a freshman<br />\nmeeting this past Sunday in the dormitory social<br />\nlounge.<br />\nThe five other freshmen who attended the<br />\nineeting to discuss the issue of parietals agreed<br />\nWith St. Peter that unrestricted women's visiting<br />\nPrivileges are what most of the dorm residents<br />\nWant. The meeting was open to all interested<br />\ns<br />\ntudents although only a few came during the 45<br />\nminute period to give their opinions.<br />\nPossible Objections<br />\nThe students also agreed that there would<br />\nbe no real<br />\ndifficulties with full visiting privileges<br />\nand that any conflicts which arose could be<br />\nWorked out by the residents of each house. Fred<br />\n,medinger, president of the DSRC, agreed that<br />\na bolition of all restrictions would be the best<br />\nthing, but he was afraid that the administration<br />\nWould raise the possibility of roommate conflicts<br />\nas an objection to the proposal.<br /><br />\nSt. Peter explained that the next step in<br />\nthe process of changing the girls' rules will be to<br />\nhold a Review Board meeting to vote on the<br />\nissue. The Review Board is composed of DSRC<br />\nmembers and freshman housemasters and the<br />\nhousemasters have already promised their full<br />\nsupport for the abolition of the present<br />\nrestrictions.<br />\nMeeting Soon<br />\nThe meeting is scheduled for March 20th<br />\nand, according to St. Peter, the Review Board<br />\nshould give its full approval to the proposal with<br />\nmuch debate. He added that the final decision<br />\nwould then be up to Mr. Bilgrave.<br />\nSt. Peter concluded by saying that the<br />\nDSRC push for abolition of girls' rules might not<br />\nbe completely successful, but it should bring<br />\nabout at least some liberalizing of the present<br />\nsystem. He felt that Mr. Bilgrave might hesitate<br />\nto approve the DSRC proposal, but he would<br />\nprobably allow 48 hour weekend privileges if the<br />\nregular proposal did not go through this time.<br /><br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br /><br />\nLevering Hall<br /><br />\nSUNDAY, MARCH 16<br />\n11 a.m. Service :<br /><br />\n\"BLACK RAGE\"<br />\nDr. Price M.

Amidst the various<br />\nintercollegiate teams and fervid intramural competition,<br />\nthere exists a small but dedicated sect of individual<br />\nathletes at Hopkins who find a challenge and personal<br />\nsatisfaction in such individualistic and strenuous sports as<br />\nskiing, boxing, judo, and karate. This is the story of one of<br />\nthese sports-judo, and one of its individuals - Kent Myers.<br />\nCol. Requests Article<br />\nAbout a month ago, Col. Serena approached me about the<br />\npossibility of the News-Letter featuring an article on Kent. Since<br />\nthen, in interviewing Kent, I've been asked also to put in a plug for<br />\nthe Homewood Judo Club of which Kent, holder of a first degree<br />\nblack belt in Judo (shodan), is an instructor and member.<br />\nKent first took up judo seven years ago in his home state of<br />\nColorado. Since then he has participated in three junior national<br />\njudo championships (ages 16 and younger). In 1964 in Miami Beach,<br />\nhe finished fourth. In 1965 at Chicago, he would have placed second<br />\nbut was eliminated on judo's intricate penalty point system. He won<br />\ntoo many matches by decision. In other words, he did not throw his<br />\nopponent for a full point. At Chicago, Kent had decisioned the<br />\nsecond and third place finishers before losing to the eventual grand<br />\nchampion. In his last junior national at Long Beach, California in<br />\n1966, Kent was eliminated early from serious competition, as he<br />\nfractured his right ankle and big toe.<br />\nThe following March at Las Vegas in the 1967 Senior AAU<br />\nNationals Kent broke the same ankle halfway through the<br />\ntournament. A month later he competed in a ranking tournament<br />\nbefore vowing never to compete again. After a year and a half<br />\nlay-off, Kent this past winter decided to reenter tournament<br />\ncompetition. Fitting Judo training in was further complicated by an<br />\nalready demanding schedule, for Kent is a pre-med and also Frank<br />\nComfort's number two diver on the Varsity swim team.<br />\nHas Competed in Nationals<br />\nA month ago, out in Catonsville, Kent participated in the<br />\nSouth Atlantic AAU tournament. He captured the 176 pound<br />\nweight class (although he weighs only 160) and eventually became<br />\nthe tourney's Grand Champion. A week later Kent's luck took a turn<br />\nfor the worse as his efforts to reach the nationals were squelched in<br />\nthe ShoFu Area Tournament in Arlington, Virginia with competitors<br />\nfrom N.J. to Louisiana vying for top honors. Kent was decisioned in<br />\nthe finals of this meet by a fourth degree black better. Kent says he<br />\nwill try again next year to make the nationals.<br />\nIn the meantime, Kent hopes to get enough interested Hopkins<br />\nstudents together to enter the Eastern Collegiate Judo Association<br />\n(includes, among others, Yale, Columbia, M.1.T., Maryland, West<br />\nPoint) to compete in collegiate matches.<br />\nAt present members of the Judo club work out twice a week<br />\nat the gym (Wednesdays at 7:00 and Sundays from 2:30 to 4:30).<br />\nSeveral others of this group of athletes work out at other Judo clubs<br />\nin the area during the week. Further information can be obtained<br />\nfrom Kent Meyers. For those interested in picking up judo, no<br />\nexperience is necessary. We wish Kent good luck in getting the judo<br />\nclub started and hope that next year he can go all the way to Grand<br />\nChampion in the AAU Nationals to bring another national title back<br />\nto Homewood.<br /><br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\nRegular Mass Schedule<br />\nSUNDAYS ..10:30 A.M.- Shaffer Hall Rm.3<br />\nWEEKDAYS 12:05 P.M.- Levering Hall Chapel<br />\nFRIDAY - March 21st - 7:00 P.M.<br />\nLENTEN PENETENTIAL SERVICE<br /><br />\nheld at NEWMAN HOUSE, 2941 N.

Washington game, as playing the most<br />\nconsistent season mentally of any Hopkins team<br />\nhe has seen since the 1940's. Perhaps this is the<br />\nkey to the Blue Jay 1969 season: mental<br />\nattitude.<br />\nThe team has now won two national stick titles in<br />\na row, and last year, especially, dominated the collegiate<br />\nscene. Yet, in looking forward to the beckoning season,<br />\none must also remember the 16-14 loss to Mt.<br />\nWashington that opened last year's season. Certainly, in<br />\nView of Hopkins' record after that loss, the stick men<br />\nhad the guns to defeat the Wolfpack as their dramatic<br />\nsecond half come back illustrated.<br />\nAgain, this year, despite the graduation of several<br />\nall-Americans and three starters, the Blue Jays have the<br />\nPotential to repeat for the third time. The entire close<br />\ndefense, boasting all-Americans Mike Clark and John<br />\nCardillo, is back along with the now experienced Paul<br />\nWeiss. The Midfields are especially deep with the entire<br />\nfirst trio returning: Charlie Goodell, Phil Buck and<br />\nCharlie Coker.<br /><br />\nIt is probable, though, that with all-American<br />\nDowny McCarty's graduation, Charlie Coker will be<br />\nmoved to attack where he starred his freshman year, and<br />\nthat Jimmy Feely, last year a high scoring midfielder<br />\nwill take his place. To continue a Hopkins tradition, the<br />\nsecond midfield will again probably consist of three,<br />\ntough, defensive players who will surrender any ground<br />\nthey give quite grudgingly. Willie Scroggs, last year's<br />\nstandout, will anchor the trio with Steve Latson, and<br />\ntransfer student Bill Donovan.<br />\nThe third midfield is of course open to a host of<br />\ncompetitors, ranging from face off man Doug Honig who<br />\n1st midfield, to Senior John<br />\nmight even face off the<br />\nPell, Juniors Russ Moore and Andy Fischer, and sophs<br />\nJim Grenefege and Doug Fuchs.<br />\nCowan Featured<br />\n- The attack, besides Coker, will of course feature<br />\ntwo time 1st team all-American Joe Cowan.

The<br />\nteam is not as deep as in recent years, but it certainly is<br />\nvery strong with no one position glaringly inadequate.<br />\nIn addition, one is tempted to remark that<br />\nHopkins' toughest competitors are much weaker.<br />\nMaryland graduated one of its best attackman, four of<br />\nits first six middies, and lost Doug Carter, another<br />\nattackman, with injuries. Navy graduated three<br />\nall-Americans. Yet one must remember that Maryland<br />\nalways has midfielders and that their goalie,<br />\nVanDershuyt, who nearly beat the Blue Jays<br />\nsingle-handedly in the 10-8 win over Maryland, will<br />\nreturn and that Navy has several fine replacements for<br />\nboth Tamelevitch and Ogilvie.
