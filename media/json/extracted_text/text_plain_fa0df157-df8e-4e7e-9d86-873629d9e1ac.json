England has been<br />\nappointed by the Hopkins Athletic<br />\nBoard to represent the interests<br />\nof the J. H. U. at this meeting.<br />\nMr. England was one of the originators of the idea of forming a<br />\nSouthern intercollegiate association<br />\nfor the purpose of holding annual<br />\ntrack and field championships, and<br />\nthe progress which has been made<br />\ntowards such an organization is<br />\nlargely due to the energetic way in<br />\nwhich he has worked ,up enthusiasm for the plan among the various<br />\nSouthern universities and colleges.<br />\nIt was first planned for representatives of Hopkins, the University of Virginia, the University<br />\nof North Carolina, and Georgetown<br />\nto get together and organize. It<br />\nwas thought that as soon as something definite had been done, some<br />\nof the other institutions would<br />\napply for membership. The plan<br />\nhas interested other institutions<br />\nfrom the start, and three of them<br />\nhave already asked for the privilege of being represented at the<br />\nmeeting on February 3. They are<br />\nWashington and Lee University,<br />\nthe Agricultural and Mechanical<br />\nCollege of North Carolina, and the<br />\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute.<br />\nMr. England said that, owing to<br />\nthe large number of institutions<br />\nwhich will be represented in the<br />\nchampionships, four places will<br />\nprobably count in every event.<br />\nThis means that every track team<br />\nshould try to develop enough good<br />\nathletes to enter at least four men<br />\nin every event. From present indications the number of contestants<br />\nwill be so large that preliminaries<br />\nwill be required the day before the<br />\nchampionships to determine the<br />\nathletes who are entitled to compete in the finals.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Inazo Nitobe, president of<br />\nthe First National College and professor in the Imperial University<br />\nof Tokio, gave on Monday and<br />\nThursday last the second and<br />\nthird of his lectures on Japan. At<br />\nboth lectures McCoy Hall was<br />\nfilled, people even standing up in<br />\nthe rear of the room. Dr. Nitobe<br />\nholds -the complete attention of<br />\nhis audiences, not only because of<br />\nthe clear and scholarly presentation of his subject, but also because<br />\nof his witty and clever observations.<br />\nThe Monday lecture was concerning the \"Geographical Features<br />\nof Japan.\" The speaker dwelt<br />\nmainly on the influence of Japan's<br />\nisland position; that the natural<br />\nboundaries restraining the Japanese had only worked to their advantage in unity, freedom from<br />\nforeign invasion and foreign complications; where China and Korea<br />\nhad suffered, Japan had escaped.<br />\n\"Japan,\" he said, \"is aware that<br />\nher mission is to mediate between<br />\nthe old and the new civilizations.<br />\nOn the Asiatic continent there .are<br />\ncrude manifestations of impatience<br />\nof European control; of fear and<br />\nhatred of the White Peril.<br />\n\"For all these recent signs of a<br />\nhostile attitude that the Far East<br />\ntakes toward the West, Japan is held<br />\ndirectly or indirectly responsible.<br />\nShe is in the exceedingly delicate<br />\nand unenviable position\u2014scapegoat<br />\nfor the whole of Asia. He reads these<br />\nsigns of the times amiss who sees<br />\nbloody conflicts as their final and<br />\ninevitable issues. As in a few years<br />\nthe waters of the Atlatitic will<br />\nmingle with the waters of the<br />\nPacific; the civilization born on the<br />\nshores of the Mediterranean and<br />\nbrought to maturity by the denizens of the Atlantic Coast will<br />\nsoon enrich the venerable civilization of the Orient.\"<br />\nDr. Nitobe evidently thinks that<br />\nthere is little chance of war between<br />\nthis country .and Japan, for in<br />\nThursday's lecture on \"History,\"<br />\nafter tracing the' development of<br />\nJapan for twenty centuries back,<br />\nhe showed that the United States<br />\nhad always been a friend of Japan,<br />\nand tha Japan in nowise intended to forget our friendship.<br />\n<br />\nThe editorial in last week's issue<br />\nof THE NEws-LETTER, although it<br />\nmade no appeal for support, has<br />\ncaused widespread comment and<br />\ncommendation among those interested in Hopkins athletics. Below<br />\nWe print a few of the letters which<br />\n. we have received from students and<br />\nalumni who believe that the final<br />\nauthority should rest with the student body. The authors of these letters are both opponents and advocates of the so-called four-year rule.<br />\nNot one expression of distrust<br />\nof the Athletic Board has .been received, but all agree that the matter<br />\nIS the most important one which we<br />\nhave had to decide for some years<br />\n... so important, in fact, that a meeting of the alumni has been called<br />\nfor tomorrow evening at the Hopkins Club.<br />\nThe writers point out that the<br />\nstudents could not be adequately<br />\nrepresented by their class members<br />\non the Board, and so the initiative<br />\nor referendum should be resorted<br />\nto. The weight of opinion favors<br />\n.the referendum; that is, the subMission of a specific plan by the Athletic Board to the students for ratification, rejection or amendment.<br />\nSome of the letters follow:<br />\nJanuary 17, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nIt certainly seems to me that the<br />\nundergraduates, who are the most<br />\naffected, should be given an opportunity to vote on the four-year rule<br />\nrestriction. For my part, I am as<br />\nYet \"on the fence,\" and I think that<br />\nIs the way with a number of my<br />\nClass mates. We do not think, however, that we can be adequately<br />\nrepresented by the man we elected<br />\nfrom the class to fill a place on the<br />\nBoard, and so we want to have a<br />\nsay. I think that the best plan<br />\nWould be for the Board to submit a<br />\nSpecific proposal,and then let us vote<br />\non it. We could be educated sufficiently to cast intelligent ballots,<br />\nthrough the publication of arguments, pro and con, in the columns<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER, and through<br />\nSpeeches made at the meeting.<br />\nNON-PARTISAN.<br />\n<br />\nJanuary 20, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEws-LErrER:<br />\nIt seems to me that the present<br />\nagitation concerning a four-year<br />\nrule in Hopkins athletics should be<br />\nsettled by a meeting of the Athletic Association, or, in other words,<br />\nby the students themselves.

As announced in<br />\nTiii NEWS-LETTER several weeks<br />\nago, he had been definitely determined upon, and the only hitch was<br />\na disagreement as to some of the<br />\ndetails, but these were successfully<br />\ndone away with and the contract<br />\nsigned on Wednesday by Graduate<br />\nAl onager Holmes and Mr. Harlan.<br />\nBoth on the gridiron and the<br />\ndiamond, Harlan is an all around<br />\nplayer, but better still, he has had<br />\ncoaching experience of the best<br />\nkind, and this is why Hopkins is<br />\nfortunate to get him. His work at<br />\nthe Gilman Country School was excellent and he also helped out in<br />\ngetting the Princeton eleven into<br />\nshape to play some of its big games.<br />\nLocally he is well known by his<br />\nplaying on the Maryland Athletic<br />\nClub Baseball team.<br />\nNow that Harlan has signed the<br />\npapers he will start in immediately<br />\nwith the candidates for the Black<br />\nand Blue baseball team. There is<br />\nsome pretty good material waiting<br />\nfor him and work will begin in the<br />\ncage about the first of next month.<br />\nIn the meantime, however, the<br />\ncoach will talk over things with<br />\nCaptain Pieper. An ambitious schedule has been arranged for the nine<br />\nand such teams as Yale, Princeton,<br />\nHarvard and Pennsylvania will be<br />\nseen on the Homewood diamond.<br />\nHarlan is a quiet young man, but<br />\nhe has the knowledge. If he is permitted to use his own judgment and<br />\nwork out things in his own way he<br />\nwill place Hopkins on the athletic<br />\nmap.<br />\nTo accept the position at Hopkins, Harlan turned down two of.<br />\nfers with larger figures in the salary<br />\ncolumn. A Southern 'varsity wanted him badly as head football coach<br />\nand Princeton wanted him to return. But Harlan is a lawyer now<br />\nand he wants to remain in Baltimore to practice his profession, so<br />\nlie cut down the salary to a figure,<br />\nhe believed Hopkins could pay.<br />\nAt first Hopkins did not want to<br />\npay as much as Harlan asked, but<br />\n\\yanted Harlan badly, so the men<br />\nwho have the welfare of the 'Varsity<br />\nat heart dug deeply into their pockets and made up the difference.<br />\nFrom many points Harlan is a<br />\ngreat baseball coach.

Of course, we<br />\nhave the bulletin boards and THE<br />\nNEws7LETTER, which do the work<br />\nto a certain- extent. But no student,<br />\nWho is doubtful of his ability, is<br />\ngoing to push himself forward into<br />\nally activity without some kind of<br />\n'personal invitation. I do not mean<br />\nthat it is necessary for the leaders<br />\nof the various activities to see each<br />\nman in. the University personally,<br />\nand ask him to try out, but I do<br />\nmean that there should be some<br />\nstronger invitation than a mere<br />\nnewspaper article., or a bulletinWard notice. I do not see why it<br />\nIS not practical for us to have a<br />\nWeekly assembly of the entire student body. At this meeting all the<br />\nannouncements for the week could<br />\nbe made, and talks could be given<br />\nWhich would keep the students informed about and interested in<br />\neverything that is going on around<br />\nschool. Perhaps it would be hard<br />\nto get the men out, but other<br />\nschools have made success of it, so<br />\nWhy can't we? If there is any spirit<br />\nat all here, and there certainly is a<br />\nlittle, this, in my opinion, is the<br />\nbest means to get it to working.<br />\nX\u2014X.<br />\nJanuary 16, 1912.<br />\n<br />\nTo the<br />\n<br />\nEditor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nMay I have a small space in your<br />\ncolumns to speak of a very large<br />\nSubject?<br />\nAt a number of colleges and<br />\nuniversities, including Columbia,<br />\nIlarvard, Princeton and Yale,<br />\nchapters of the Intercollegiate<br />\nSocialist Society have been formed<br />\nWith the stated object: \"To pro/note an intelligent interest in Socialism among college men and<br />\nWomen.\"<br />\nIt is only reasonable to look for<br />\nt he .Hopkins, as a \"university,\" to<br />\n\u00b0e numbered among the progressives.<br />\nSeveral Hopkins men have already signified their interest in<br />\nthis movement.<br />\nThe undersigned will be glad to<br />\nhear directly from all who approve,<br />\nor who wish further information<br />\nupon the plan to start a Hopkins<br />\nchapter.<br />\nVery respectfully,<br />\nREV.

It will<br />\ntake place in the cage. The seating capacity is limited, so that<br />\ntickets will be issued for places in<br />\nthe gallery. The gymnasium, however, will be thrown open to accommodate the crowd.<br />\nThe candidates for both teams<br />\nare working hard, along with the<br />\n'Varsity squad. The freshmen<br />\nhave some men out who show<br />\npromise of making a good team.<br />\nCaptain Uhler seems to be the best<br />\nin the distance event, together with<br />\nBiser and Deems. Prince and<br />\nMason will enter the shorter races.<br />\nThe strong part of the team seems<br />\nto be found in the field events, with<br />\nthese men entered: De Witt, Short,<br />\nMasbn, Schwartz, Voshell, Tarr<br />\nand Thompson.<br />\nThe sophomore team will consist<br />\nof what is left of last year's aggregation. Schreiber, who won the<br />\nshot-put, has left; Bryan and Reilly<br />\nare also gone. Liebensperger bids<br />\nfair to take Schreiber's place in the<br />\nshot-put. He is putting the weight<br />\nvery nearly forty feet, and doing<br />\nwell in the high jump and polevault. Wells, who is captain, will<br />\noffset the rest of the lost strength.<br />\nLast year he was sick at the time<br />\nof the meet. He will be the principal contestant in the quarter mile<br />\nand the mile. Catlin will enter the<br />\nhalf, and run the mile with Wells.<br />\nHollyday, Snyder, Del Valle, Chenoweth .and Sutton will complete the<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe contest will consist of the<br />\nregulation events of the A.

England has been<br />\nappointed by the Hopkins Athletic<br />\nBoard to represent the interests<br />\nof the J. H. U. at this meeting.<br />\nMr. England was one of the originators of the idea of forming a<br />\nSouthern intercollegiate association<br />\nfor the purpose of holding annual<br />\ntrack and field championships, and<br />\nthe progress which has been made<br />\ntowards such an organization is<br />\nlargely due to the energetic way in<br />\nwhich he has worked ,up enthusiasm for the plan among the various<br />\nSouthern universities and colleges.<br />\nIt was first planned for representatives of Hopkins, the University of Virginia, the University<br />\nof North Carolina, and Georgetown<br />\nto get together and organize. It<br />\nwas thought that as soon as something definite had been done, some<br />\nof the other institutions would<br />\napply for membership. The plan<br />\nhas interested other institutions<br />\nfrom the start, and three of them<br />\nhave already asked for the privilege of being represented at the<br />\nmeeting on February 3. They are<br />\nWashington and Lee University,<br />\nthe Agricultural and Mechanical<br />\nCollege of North Carolina, and the<br />\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute.<br />\nMr. England said that, owing to<br />\nthe large number of institutions<br />\nwhich will be represented in the<br />\nchampionships, four places will<br />\nprobably count in every event.<br />\nThis means that every track team<br />\nshould try to develop enough good<br />\nathletes to enter at least four men<br />\nin every event. From present indications the number of contestants<br />\nwill be so large that preliminaries<br />\nwill be required the day before the<br />\nchampionships to determine the<br />\nathletes who are entitled to compete in the finals.<br /><br />\nDr. Inazo Nitobe, president of<br />\nthe First National College and professor in the Imperial University<br />\nof Tokio, gave on Monday and<br />\nThursday last the second and<br />\nthird of his lectures on Japan. At<br />\nboth lectures McCoy Hall was<br />\nfilled, people even standing up in<br />\nthe rear of the room. Dr. Nitobe<br />\nholds -the complete attention of<br />\nhis audiences, not only because of<br />\nthe clear and scholarly presentation of his subject, but also because<br />\nof his witty and clever observations.<br />\nThe Monday lecture was concerning the \"Geographical Features<br />\nof Japan.\" The speaker dwelt<br />\nmainly on the influence of Japan's<br />\nisland position; that the natural<br />\nboundaries restraining the Japanese had only worked to their advantage in unity, freedom from<br />\nforeign invasion and foreign complications; where China and Korea<br />\nhad suffered, Japan had escaped.<br />\n\"Japan,\" he said, \"is aware that<br />\nher mission is to mediate between<br />\nthe old and the new civilizations.<br />\nOn the Asiatic continent there .are<br />\ncrude manifestations of impatience<br />\nof European control; of fear and<br />\nhatred of the White Peril.<br />\n\"For all these recent signs of a<br />\nhostile attitude that the Far East<br />\ntakes toward the West, Japan is held<br />\ndirectly or indirectly responsible.<br />\nShe is in the exceedingly delicate<br />\nand unenviable position\u2014scapegoat<br />\nfor the whole of Asia.

Below<br />\nWe print a few of the letters which<br />\n. we have received from students and<br />\nalumni who believe that the final<br />\nauthority should rest with the student body. The authors of these letters are both opponents and advocates of the so-called four-year rule.<br />\nNot one expression of distrust<br />\nof the Athletic Board has .been received, but all agree that the matter<br />\nIS the most important one which we<br />\nhave had to decide for some years<br />\n... so important, in fact, that a meeting of the alumni has been called<br />\nfor tomorrow evening at the Hopkins Club.<br />\nThe writers point out that the<br />\nstudents could not be adequately<br />\nrepresented by their class members<br />\non the Board, and so the initiative<br />\nor referendum should be resorted<br />\nto. The weight of opinion favors<br />\n.the referendum; that is, the subMission of a specific plan by the Athletic Board to the students for ratification, rejection or amendment.<br />\nSome of the letters follow:<br />\nJanuary 17, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nIt certainly seems to me that the<br />\nundergraduates, who are the most<br />\naffected, should be given an opportunity to vote on the four-year rule<br />\nrestriction. For my part, I am as<br />\nYet \"on the fence,\" and I think that<br />\nIs the way with a number of my<br />\nClass mates. We do not think, however, that we can be adequately<br />\nrepresented by the man we elected<br />\nfrom the class to fill a place on the<br />\nBoard, and so we want to have a<br />\nsay. I think that the best plan<br />\nWould be for the Board to submit a<br />\nSpecific proposal,and then let us vote<br />\non it.

As announced in<br />\nTiii NEWS-LETTER several weeks<br />\nago, he had been definitely determined upon, and the only hitch was<br />\na disagreement as to some of the<br />\ndetails, but these were successfully<br />\ndone away with and the contract<br />\nsigned on Wednesday by Graduate<br />\nAl onager Holmes and Mr. Harlan.<br />\nBoth on the gridiron and the<br />\ndiamond, Harlan is an all around<br />\nplayer, but better still, he has had<br />\ncoaching experience of the best<br />\nkind, and this is why Hopkins is<br />\nfortunate to get him. His work at<br />\nthe Gilman Country School was excellent and he also helped out in<br />\ngetting the Princeton eleven into<br />\nshape to play some of its big games.<br />\nLocally he is well known by his<br />\nplaying on the Maryland Athletic<br />\nClub Baseball team.<br />\nNow that Harlan has signed the<br />\npapers he will start in immediately<br />\nwith the candidates for the Black<br />\nand Blue baseball team. There is<br />\nsome pretty good material waiting<br />\nfor him and work will begin in the<br />\ncage about the first of next month.<br />\nIn the meantime, however, the<br />\ncoach will talk over things with<br />\nCaptain Pieper. An ambitious schedule has been arranged for the nine<br />\nand such teams as Yale, Princeton,<br />\nHarvard and Pennsylvania will be<br />\nseen on the Homewood diamond.<br />\nHarlan is a quiet young man, but<br />\nhe has the knowledge. If he is permitted to use his own judgment and<br />\nwork out things in his own way he<br />\nwill place Hopkins on the athletic<br />\nmap.<br />\nTo accept the position at Hopkins, Harlan turned down two of.<br />\nfers with larger figures in the salary<br />\ncolumn. A Southern 'varsity wanted him badly as head football coach<br />\nand Princeton wanted him to return. But Harlan is a lawyer now<br />\nand he wants to remain in Baltimore to practice his profession, so<br />\nlie cut down the salary to a figure,<br />\nhe believed Hopkins could pay.<br />\nAt first Hopkins did not want to<br />\npay as much as Harlan asked, but<br />\n\\yanted Harlan badly, so the men<br />\nwho have the welfare of the 'Varsity<br />\nat heart dug deeply into their pockets and made up the difference.<br />\nFrom many points Harlan is a<br />\ngreat baseball coach.

Of course, we<br />\nhave the bulletin boards and THE<br />\nNEws7LETTER, which do the work<br />\nto a certain- extent. But no student,<br />\nWho is doubtful of his ability, is<br />\ngoing to push himself forward into<br />\nally activity without some kind of<br />\n'personal invitation. I do not mean<br />\nthat it is necessary for the leaders<br />\nof the various activities to see each<br />\nman in. the University personally,<br />\nand ask him to try out, but I do<br />\nmean that there should be some<br />\nstronger invitation than a mere<br />\nnewspaper article., or a bulletinWard notice. I do not see why it<br />\nIS not practical for us to have a<br />\nWeekly assembly of the entire student body. At this meeting all the<br />\nannouncements for the week could<br />\nbe made, and talks could be given<br />\nWhich would keep the students informed about and interested in<br />\neverything that is going on around<br />\nschool. Perhaps it would be hard<br />\nto get the men out, but other<br />\nschools have made success of it, so<br />\nWhy can't we? If there is any spirit<br />\nat all here, and there certainly is a<br />\nlittle, this, in my opinion, is the<br />\nbest means to get it to working.<br />\nX\u2014X.<br />\nJanuary 16, 1912.<br /><br />\nTo the<br /><br />\nEditor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nMay I have a small space in your<br />\ncolumns to speak of a very large<br />\nSubject?<br />\nAt a number of colleges and<br />\nuniversities, including Columbia,<br />\nIlarvard, Princeton and Yale,<br />\nchapters of the Intercollegiate<br />\nSocialist Society have been formed<br />\nWith the stated object: \"To pro/note an intelligent interest in Socialism among college men and<br />\nWomen.\"<br />\nIt is only reasonable to look for<br />\nt he .Hopkins, as a \"university,\" to<br />\n\u00b0e numbered among the progressives.<br />\nSeveral Hopkins men have already signified their interest in<br />\nthis movement.<br />\nThe undersigned will be glad to<br />\nhear directly from all who approve,<br />\nor who wish further information<br />\nupon the plan to start a Hopkins<br />\nchapter.<br />\nVery respectfully,<br />\nREV.

It will<br />\ntake place in the cage. The seating capacity is limited, so that<br />\ntickets will be issued for places in<br />\nthe gallery. The gymnasium, however, will be thrown open to accommodate the crowd.<br />\nThe candidates for both teams<br />\nare working hard, along with the<br />\n'Varsity squad. The freshmen<br />\nhave some men out who show<br />\npromise of making a good team.<br />\nCaptain Uhler seems to be the best<br />\nin the distance event, together with<br />\nBiser and Deems. Prince and<br />\nMason will enter the shorter races.<br />\nThe strong part of the team seems<br />\nto be found in the field events, with<br />\nthese men entered: De Witt, Short,<br />\nMasbn, Schwartz, Voshell, Tarr<br />\nand Thompson.<br />\nThe sophomore team will consist<br />\nof what is left of last year's aggregation. Schreiber, who won the<br />\nshot-put, has left; Bryan and Reilly<br />\nare also gone. Liebensperger bids<br />\nfair to take Schreiber's place in the<br />\nshot-put. He is putting the weight<br />\nvery nearly forty feet, and doing<br />\nwell in the high jump and polevault. Wells, who is captain, will<br />\noffset the rest of the lost strength.<br />\nLast year he was sick at the time<br />\nof the meet. He will be the principal contestant in the quarter mile<br />\nand the mile. Catlin will enter the<br />\nhalf, and run the mile with Wells.<br />\nHollyday, Snyder, Del Valle, Chenoweth .and Sutton will complete the<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe contest will consist of the<br />\nregulation events of the A.
