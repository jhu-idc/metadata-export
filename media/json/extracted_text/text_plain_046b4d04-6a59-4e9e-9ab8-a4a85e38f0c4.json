Traditionally drawing<br />\ntogether over 150,000 of King Schaefer's<br />\nsubjects, this year the fair is showcased<br />\n<br />\nbeyond our control. When such<br />\nthings happen, we attempt to<br />\ncover for the malfunctioning<br />\nequipment so that the show isn't<br />\naffected.<br />\nDespite our best<br />\nefforts, we don't always succeed.<br />\nOf particular note here is the<br />\nfact that the Senior Class<br />\nprojectors are used during the<br />\nweek by just about any student<br />\ngroup that requests a projector<br />\nfrom Student Activities. It is<br />\ndifficult to ensure the perfect<br />\noperation of projectors in any<br />\ncase, but especially so when you<br />\nhave no idea how many untrained people have been using<br />\nthem. In regard to the Student<br />\nCouncil Film Series and Weekend Wonder Flix, the split<br />\n(which neither group wanted,<br />\nbut neither group could avert)<br />\nbetween the two series left both<br />\ngroups without backup equipment.

But even before deliberating over the choices put<br />\nforth, we must ask one fundamental -yet too often ignored question: do we, the students,<br />\nneed to accept any constitution,<br />\nand thus legitimize the council,<br />\nor should we recognize the<br />\ncouncil as dispensable, not fulfilling its basic promises to the<br />\nstudents, and thus abolish it?<br />\nBefore passing judgement<br />\non the worthiness of the council,<br />\nhowever, we must establish<br />\nexactly what we expect of it.<br />\nWithout a doubt, there exists<br />\nbut a sole purpose of the council: to act as a voice for the<br />\nstudent body: to expound the<br />\nviews of students, guard the<br />\nstudent interests, and to encourage student debate. Yes, the<br />\nCouncil has other functions:<br />\nacting as an administrative body,<br />\nrepresenting the student body at<br />\nceremonial functions, as well as<br />\npacifying those who couldn't<br />\nbear not having some sort of<br />\ngovernment - however specious hanging over their heads; but,<br />\nnone of these can be said to<br />\ncreate the basic justification of<br />\nthe Council's existence. A true<br />\nstudent council would be a voice<br />\nto all:<br />\nan medium through<br />\nwhich students could exchange<br />\nviews and reach other students; a<br />\nspearhead of student relations<br />\nwith the faculty and administration; and a platform for expressing student views on current<br />\nissues to the outside world.<br />\nUnfortunately, our so-called<br />\nstudent council communicates<br />\ndirectly with no one but itself.<br />\nWhen students cannot identify<br />\ntheir own representatives - and<br />\noften not even their president;<br />\nwhen over one half of the<br />\nstudent body regularly fails to<br />\nvote - and when they do,\"none<br />\nof the above\" has been known<br />\nto carry elections; when council<br />\n<br />\ndebates seem limited to interpretations of Robert's Rules of<br />\nOrder, and any action emanating<br />\nfrom the council results purely<br />\nfrom in-fighting; when the council sits idle, refusing to take a<br />\nstand; in short, when the council<br />\nproves itself impotent and the<br />\nstudents could care less, what<br />\nright to existance can the<br />\nIf today's<br />\ncouncil claim?<br />\ncouncil cannot fulfill the basic<br />\nfunctions of a true student<br />\ncouncil, then we must not<br />\nfool ourselves into believing that<br />\nwe are adequately governed.<br />\nAnd when we are not adequately<br />\ngoverned, it remains our duty as<br />\nvoters to show our disapproval<br />\nand abolish the council as a<br />\nwhole.<br />\nOf course, many will contend that while the Council has<br />\nproblems, it would be rash to<br />\nabolish it now. But when should<br />\nwe decide to leave our paranoia<br />\nof decisive change and opt for<br />\naction? The Council has existed<br />\nfor years, and has consistently,<br />\nand adamantly, separated itself<br />\nfrom true student politics bringing its seclusion to an<br />\nuntenable absurdity when it<br />\ninvoked secret meetings. Every<br />\nyear new representatives have<br />\nbeen elected, every year new<br />\nconstitutions were possible, yet<br />\nno true change has ever occurred. It becomes obvious that it<br />\nis not the council members, or<br />\nhow they mold the system of<br />\ngovernment which is at fault,<br />\nbut the basic framework within<br />\nwhich they work. In order to<br />\nestablish a system which we feel<br />\nwill be responsible to student<br />\nneeds, we must first strip the<br />\ndefunct council of all legitimacy,<br />\nor it will cling to its power of<br />\ntradition and custom, and hinder<br />\nany effort to build a new system. As each year only proves<br />\nonce again, that no change in the<br />\ntype and quality of governing<br />\nwill ever occur within the<br />\nexisting system, it appears that<br />\nthe rash action would not be to<br />\ntear down the old', in order to<br />\n<br />\ncould get. Although bursts of<br />\nclapping and boos erupted during the debates, those who<br />\nremained in the sultry ,stuffy hall<br />\nto await Anderson could muster<br />\nup only perfunctory, sporadic<br />\ndemonstrations of support.<br />\nThe trim and wrapping on<br />\nthe package did not cover the<br />\nlack of confidence and enthusiasm in both camps; rather, it<br />\ntypified the prevalent aura of<br />\nnostalgia. Snatches of conversation ranged from \"Remember<br />\nAdlai Stevenson?\" to \"I was a<br />\nMcGovern man back in '72\",<br />\nwhile discussions of the candidates themselves centered mainly on a peculiar form of<br />\none-up-manship, e.g. \"You may<br />\nhave joined the campaign two<br />\nyears ago, but my father is close<br />\nfriends with the number-two<br />\nman in our district.\"<br />\nIf the intent of the rally was<br />\nto raise the spirits and insure<br />\nthe votes of supporters, it failed<br />\nmiserably. Many former campaign workers returned home<br />\nwondering what they had ever<br />\nseen in their candidate in the<br />\nfirst place. The general sentiment was expressed in a joke<br />\nwhich quickly made the rounds:<br />\n\"Did you hear who won the<br />\ndebates?

When<br />\nthe current Council took office<br />\nlast May, it voted to condemn<br />\nthe invalidation but did not<br />\nrescind the decision. Current SC<br />\npresident Michael Steele explained, \"We did not have the<br />\nauthority to overturn the decision. We lacked the procedure.\"<br />\nSteele authorized the writing of a new draft, called Proposal C, over the summer. According to Steele, C is a compromise<br />\nproposal containing the best of<br />\nboth A and B.<br />\nAt first glance, Proposal C is<br />\nquite similar to the rejected<br />\nProposal A. Many of the sections are almost identical. However, there are some substantial<br />\nalterations.<br />\nProposal C has incorporated<br />\nsections of Proposal B such as<br />\nthose which require open meetings and allow any qualified<br />\nstudent to chair any of the six<br />\nmajor committees. The basic<br />\ndifferences between Proposals B<br />\nand C are:<br />\na) Proposal C does not<br />\nrequire mandatory roll call<br />\nvotes.<br />\nb) Proposal B requires SC<br />\nmembers who sit on joint<br />\ncommittees with the administration to attempt to make their<br />\nmeetings open to the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nc) Proposal B prohibits the<br />\nSC president to vote on the SAC<br />\ncommittee<br />\nd) Proposal B makes it<br />\neasier to impeach an officer.<br />\n<br />\nHarry Lerner, author of<br />\nProposal B who currently<br />\nattends law school, has contended that the administration's<br />\nproposal makes the student<br />\ncouncil unaccountable to the<br />\nstudent body. He is afraid<br />\nthat Proposal C's elections<br />\ncommission (all new proposals<br />\nhave included an<br />\nelections<br />\ncommission) will too easily be<br />\nable to invalidate impeachment<br />\nreferenda. Lerner also protests<br />\nproposal A and C's refusal to<br />\ndistribute copies of the Constitution to all students.<br />\nMike Steele feels that Proposal B is \"inoperable\" and will<br />\nseverely strain relations with the<br />\nadministration. He feels that<br />\nit will be too easy to impeach<br />\nofficials. In response to Lemer's<br />\nproposal to distribute copies of<br />\nthe constitution Steele replied,<br />\n\"Harry has no sense of what a<br />\nbudget is and what things cost.\"<br />\nOn August 15, Harry Lerner<br />\nsent a memo to the Student<br />\nCouncil in which he raised<br />\nseveral objections. In addition<br />\nto criticizing several SC members<br />\nby name, he argued that the<br />\nformer SC invalidation should be<br />\nrescinded and that no new<br />\nadditions to the referendum<br />\nshould be allowed.<br />\nSteele has refused to respond<br />\nto Lerner's memo.<br />\n\"Harry is a student who has<br />\ngraduated,\" he explained. \"I<br />\nhave no intention of answering<br />\nHarry's memo. He has no say in<br />\nwhat we do here at the university.\"<br />\nLerner also requested in his<br />\nmemo that he be reimbursed for<br />\nhis expenses in advertising his<br />\n<br />\nproposal. Steele asserts that the<br />\ncurrent constitution contains no<br />\nprovision requiring him to do so.<br />\nJim Hoelz, chairman of the<br />\ntemporary Elections Commission, said that when a separate<br />\nelections commission is finally<br />\nestablished students will be<br />\nreimbursed, up to a certain<br />\namount, for advertising their<br />\nproposal.<br />\nOne of Lerner's arguments<br />\nis that if the council has the<br />\npower to rescind its support of<br />\nProposal A in favor of Proposal<br />\nC, it also has the power to<br />\nrescind the invalidation of the<br />\noriginal election. To this claim<br />\nSteele responded, \"Because Proposal A was passed in Council,<br />\nnot by the student body through<br />\nreferendum, that proposal is still<br />\nsupported by the Council regardless of the fact that it was<br />\nproduced by a previoes council.<br />\nThe distinguishing point is this:<br />\nit did not reach student referendum because it was invalidated.<br />\n\"Therefore if it had passed<br />\nstudent referendum and we<br />\nwanted to make changes, we'd<br />\nhave to go through referendum<br />\nagain. Because it didn't get that<br />\nfar, this Council felt it couldn't<br />\nsupport Proposal A the way it<br />\nwas written. What we've done is<br />\nrescind our support of Proposal<br />\nA which means as a council we<br />\ndon't feel that the proposal best<br />\nserves the students.\"<br />\nHoelz noted the situation<br />\nwould never had occurred if a<br />\nseparate elections commission<br />\nhad already existed, for with the<br />\npresence of a commission the SC<br />\nwould not have had the power<br />\nto rescind any election.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 6/ SEPTEMBER 26, 1980<br />\n<br />\nMSE Symposium<br />\ncont. from p.1<br />\nOctober 22nd, is the U.S.<br />\nSurgeon General and editor of<br />\nCurrents in American Medicine.<br />\nSociologist and author of<br />\nThe Real Majority, Ben Wattenberg is scheduled to speak<br />\nOctober 27th on \"The Social<br />\nCrisis: Withdrawal from Society\".

When your eyes have moved across every line of<br />\nall 200 copies of this article, you will have looked at as<br />\nmany letters as there are books at the Strand Book<br />\nStore. In fact, if you lined up every book side by side,<br />\nthe row would stretch from the World Trade Center to<br />\nthe doorstep of Harlem.

The store is about fifty years old. It was named<br />\nafter the Strand in London, a street which has historically been a marketplace for used and rare b000ks. New<br />\nYork's Strand was originally one of a number of such<br />\nstores in the area (Abbey Books, 8th Street Bookstore),<br />\nmost of which are now out of businesss. The Strand<br />\nhas expanded and thrived partly because of its collection<br />\nof reviewer's copies of new books sold for half of list<br />\nprice and its international mail order service (free<br />\nshipping to anywhere in the world).<br />\nTo my friends and me, as we contemplated a<br />\nsummer in Greenwich Village, it seemed a stimulating<br />\nplace to work. After all, didn't we all love books?<br />\nAnd didn't the Strand's bustling main floor<br />\nwith its creaking floors, its whirring fans, and its tweedy<br />\ncustomers evoke the browser's dream of a 19th century<br />\nbookstore? There is always a bag lady or two sorting<br />\nthhrough the paperbaacks, and the employees are figures<br />\nresembling, among others, Vincent Van Gogh and Wally<br />\nCleaver.<br />\nFor almost all the employees, the Strand is a way<br />\nof making money rather than a career. Most of them are<br />\n<br />\naitists who work at the store because ideally it's a job<br />\nthat doesn.'t distract them or fatigue them from their<br />\nreal work. At the Strand, you may find a truck driver<br />\nwho is awell respected sculptor, a playwright shelving a<br />\npaperback copy of his own play, or a punk keyboardist<br />\ntyping up a book order slip. In many ways the Strand<br />\nhas been the cradle of punk; Patty Smith, Richard Hell,<br />\nRobin Crutchfield' (DNA, Dark Day), and Jody Harris<br />\n(Contortions, Ray Beats) once worked or are still<br />\nworking there. To get an idea of the kind of people who<br />\nshop at the Strand,leaf through a copy of Self-Portraits,<br />\nby former Strand employee Burt Britton. When he ran<br />\nthe Review Section (new books), he asked hundreds of<br />\nwriters who dropped by, many of them major figures in<br />\nthe American literary world, to draw pictures of themselves. I never met any of these illustrious men of letters<br />\nwhile I was working, but perhaps I just didn't recognize<br />\nthem from their drrawings.<br />\nIn a word, the Strand was charming. It appealed<br />\nto all of my vague, romantic feelings about what<br />\nGreenwich Village was supposed to b( It was also the<br />\nonly summer job to be found in the city.<br />\nSo, in January, we all trooped in,one after the<br />\nother, hat and resume in hand, and<br />\ncompliant smile<br />\naffizixed to our scribbed faces. I was the last one, the<br />\nfourth Writing Seminars major from Johns Hopkins,<br />\nciting the same acquaintance who had worked there the<br />\nyear before, and denying any knowledge of the other<br />\nthree who came before.<br />\nThe Strand's owner, Mr. Bass, looked at me<br />\nsuspiciously from over the gold rims of his bifocals. His<br />\nhead was just visible over a monstrous pile of leather<br />\nbound volumes. Wow, I thought, someone's library of<br />\nfirst editions. Stepping into view my prospective employer tucked a gold railroad watch into the pocket of<br />\nhis vest.<br />\n\"Fill this out,\" he said. He handed me a form.<br />\n\"It's a little test.\"<br />\nI put down the usual information: name,<br />\naddress, number. Section II was matching authors with<br />\ntheir books. Who wrote the Rhyme of the Ancient<br />\nMariner? A tale of Two Cities; Dickens wasn't on the<br />\nlist. Must be a trick question. The owner frowned over<br />\nmy finished work.<br />\n\"The job might entail some heavy work.\" He<br />\neyed my biceps, which fortunately were shrouded in one<br />\nof my father's sweaters. \"Well, you applied so early, I<br />\nguess I have to accept you.\" He sighed. The hours were<br />\n9:15 to 6:15, with one unpaid hour for lunch. The store<br />\nwas closed on Sundays. I would be given a day off.<br />\nI shook hands and bowed my way to the cc door<br />\nwhere my friends waited with their collars turned up and<br />\nhats pulled down. We were sure he suspected something.<br />\nFirst Days: Down in Review<br />\nThe first thing that a summer employee does in<br />\nthe morning is pull the long-handled broomes out of the<br />\nmen's room vestibule and sweep all the floors. Without this daily sweeping, the dust situation would grow<br />\nout of control; besides, Mr. Bass hates the noise of<br />\nvacuum cleaners. Psychologically this task reminds the<br />\nworker that he is new and inexperienced, and build<br />\ninhim a respect and envy for his seniors, who, besides not<br />\nhaving to sweep, have the added priviledge of arriving at<br />\n9:30 instead of 9:15. Many have found sweeping<br />\ndistasteful and demeaning, but I enjoyed it:<br />\nMy next job was in Review. The idea here is that<br />\nthe book reviewers, or anyone who can get their hands<br />\non new books for free, bring them into the store and sell<br />\nthem at the desk. Chet Flippo describes this process<br />\nfrom the reviewer's point of view in a recent Rolling<br />\nStone article:<br />\n...every Saturday afternnoon you ccan see every lowrent<br />\nbook rreviewer in Manhattan struggling in with these D'A gostino<br />\nchopping bags MI of review copies -- Scruples-- staggering down<br />\nthe metal stairs into the basement and weaving through the<br />\naisles -- tachycardia time! -to finally dump these goddamn<br />\nshopping bags MI of hooks tehey've heaved and carried all the<br />\nway down from West Ninety-Sixth Street, the goddamn ba bags<br />\nripping and The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet falling out on<br />\nthe goddamn sidewalk there at Twelfth and Broadway, so they<br />\nscoop it up and finally dump all these goddamn books on the<br />\n.floor there at the back of the Strand's basement in front of this<br />\nrope they have stretched across there, and they avert their eyes<br />\nand try to look literary, bug-eyed and wheezing and army navy<br />\nturtlenecked and Frye-hooted, real Levied literary -- while some<br />\ngoddamn pustular NY U major behind the rope takes his goddamn sweet time to sift through the hound detritus...<br />\n<br />\nw-rent book reviewers:<br />\nthey try to look literary, bug-eyed and wheezing.<br />\n<br />\nAnyway the eager summer employee is<br />\nsupposed to grab these books out of the boxes and put<br />\nthem on the shelves in alphabetical order as fast as<br />\npossible. The 2' by 3' boxes of books to be shelved pile<br />\nup to the celing. Eventually you slow down because it<br />\nwill take you days to shelve what the store has bought<br />\non one busy afternoon.<br />\nSoon the shelves are filling up too. When you<br />\ncan't fit a book on the shelf, you pack it away in<br />\nanother set of 2' by 3' boxes called SNR (shelving no<br />\nroom). These are dated, alphabetized and piled up against<br />\nthe back wall behind the Review section. They also get<br />\nstacked up to the ceiling, leaving an aisle about one foot<br />\n<br />\nwide to walk in. Never look up. You'll think the sky is<br />\nfalling on your head.<br />\nSometimes shelving was so tight you just took<br />\nthe books out of one box, rearranged them and put<br />\nthem into another. An exercize in futility, perhaps; but<br />\nthey tell me that because of my work, someday these<br />\nbooks will be sold. There are customers out there who<br />\nwant these books. The authors smile symmpathetically<br />\noff the covers of their books: Dozing it it the Wild Way,<br />\nThis I Believe, Me. How I S Stay Beautiful, Eat Your<br />\nShitty Parts. I guess it's all worth it.<br />\nAs if in punishment, there would be boxes of<br />\nbooks that, by some cruel quirk in the alphabet or a plot<br />\nby the author of Gold Dust Twins, all belong on the top<br />\nshelf. There is never a ladder r in the aisle so I have to<br />\nhunt for one. I carry the metal ladder on my back in<br />\nand oout of the aisles excusing myself to customers.<br />\nThe ladder is wide.

If the production of a great<br />\nliterary work calls for crowd scenes, then<br />\nyour TV screen is sure to be filled with a<br />\nconvincingly costumed throng; if it calls<br />\nfor the outdoors, then the landscape will<br />\nbe breath-taking; if the decor is of a<br />\ncertain period (as it always it), there will<br />\nnot be a single goblet out'of character.<br />\nThis concern for authentic and<br />\nimpressive appearance makes many<br />\nMasterpiece Theatre productions guaranteed good enterainment even before the<br />\nacting is taken into consideration. Viewers of Upstairs, Downstairs and the series<br />\nof Anthony Trollope classics could easily<br />\npass over the few mediocre performances<br />\nin these productions, while most viewers<br />\nwho watched the nine episodes of War<br />\nand Peace (in which the acting was<br />\nsuperb) will agree that the series was<br />\nworth it for the battle scenes alone.<br />\nFyodor Doestoyevsky's Crime and<br />\nPunishment, a psycho-drama of murder,<br />\nconfession, and redemption, is a very<br />\ndifferent sort of production for Masterpiece Theatre. The four-part series,<br />\nwhich will begin this Sunday evening at<br />\nnine p.m. on channel 6, Maryland Center<br />\nfor Public Broadcasting, certainly has<br />\nconvincing Russian crowds, and oppressive Petersburg atmosphere. Nevertheless,<br />\nit must focus entirely upon its central<br />\ncharacter, the self-tortured student-recluse Raskolnikov. The story's complex<br />\npsychological plot cannot be conveyed by<br />\nextensive action, dialogue, or attention to<br />\nphysical detail. The viewer depends on<br />\nthe face of Raskolnikov, as the murderer<br />\nwanders slowly about St. Petersburt or<br />\nstands stock still in his garret, lost in<br />\nthought, for an understanding of<br />\nDoestoyevsky's novel. Thus the burden<br />\nof the production is borne entirely by<br />\nthe actors.<br />\nJohn Hurt (Caligula in BBC's<br />\n<br />\nClaudius and co-star in Midnight Ex- Marmelodov, while Beatrix Lehman is<br />\npress), playing the role of Raskolnikov, bloodless and detestible as the elderly<br />\npawnbroker.<br />\nAnne Orwin offers a<br />\nmakes the series a success.

In fact, it is when he perceptions.<br />\nAnd of course,in the true spirit of<br />\nsmiles that we have a sense that Raskolnikov's anguished expression is the result Masterpiece Theatre, the scenery is lavish.<br />\nof what he is inflicting upon himself. In Producer Jonathan Powell parleys areas<br />\nthe few instances that Raskolnikov is of Greenwich in South London, and<br />\nresponding with happiness, or open grief, Scotland's Edinborough, into a dark and<br />\nor honest warmth to his fellow man,he is suffocating St. Petersburt.

At one point in his tale,.he<br />\nrecalls the day he got a new job and came<br />\nhome to his wife with money - how she<br />\nrejoiced, how the burden was lifted from<br />\nhis heart. Raskolnikov, despite himself, is<br />\nlistening raptly, and his face lights up. A<br />\nmoment later, Marmaledov brings the<br />\nstory to its wretched conclusion, and the<br />\noppression sinks back onto Raskolnikov's<br />\nfeatures, making him a wraith again.<br />\nThus the many long silences and<br />\nstills necessitated by the story are used to<br />\nadvantage. But when he is not alone on<br />\nthe screen, Hurt also has the benefit of a<br />\nstrong supporting cast.

Their<br />\nconsensus was that while human beings<br />\n<br />\nIn science fiction, plot and<br />\ncharacterization partly rely on the<br />\nsituation in which the story is placed.<br />\nTherefore, science fiction authors will<br />\noften begin by creating a world and then<br />\nderiving a story from. its environment.<br />\nFour science fiction authors gave an<br />\nexample of this technique in a panel<br />\ndiscussion sponsored by Hopsfa Tuesday<br />\nnight<br />\nThe authors -- Charles Sheffield,<br />\nDave Bischoff, Chris Lampton, and<br />\nSteve Brown -- began by postulating a<br />\nplanet with an unusual property; it<br />\nrotated with sufficient velocity to produce zero gravity at the equator.

The squad placed<br />\nsecond in the MAC and second<br />\nin the Division II East Coast<br />\nChampionship. This year, a<br />\nchange in the coaching staff,<br />\nthe graduation of two all-MAC<br />\nplayers, Steve Long and Brian<br />\nKutsunai, and a restructuring<br />\nof the MAC have presented<br />\nsome challenges, but Hopkins<br />\ngood chance of<br />\nstill has a<br />\nwinning the East Coast title.<br />\nMiles Chedekel replaces<br />\n1979 coach Bob Summers,<br />\nwho took the position of<br />\nassistant coach in order to give<br />\nhimself more time to complete<br />\nhis dissertation. Chedekel is a<br />\nprofessor at the 'School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health. He<br />\nplayed water plo as an undergraduate at UCLA, and coached the University of Minnesota<br />\nand Iowa State water polo<br />\nclubs. He then took the same<br />\njob at Ohio State and was<br />\npresident and founder of the<br />\nMid East Water Polo Conference<br />\nThis year's team is relatively young, with captains Wynn<br />\nMcCloskey, a senior, and juni-<br />\n<br />\nors Jeff Salmore and Craig<br />\nWeinert comprising most of the<br />\nupperclassmen on the team.<br />\nCoach Chedekel said, \"Most of<br />\nour strength is in the underclassmen.<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nand<br />\nsophomores make up the<br />\n<br />\nnucleus of the team.\" The<br />\nlosses of all-MAC goalie Steve<br />\nLong is felt by the club, but<br />\nChedekel has been very impressed<br />\nwith the new goalie, sophomore Dave Schaefer, in practice.<br />\n<br />\nAnother challenge faced<br />\nby the club is the reorganization of the MAC. Under the<br />\nnew structure, Divisions I and<br />\nII are merged, with the top<br />\nthree schools in the league<br />\ngoing to the Division I finals,<br />\n<br />\nPractice makes perfect as the Jay Water Polo squad moves toward Division I competition.<br />\n<br />\nSoccer Tourney A Disappointment For Jays<br />\nBY JEFF ARONOFF<br />\nThe JHU soccer team did<br />\nnot fare too well in its recent<br />\ntrip to Lynchburg, Virginia.<br />\nThe squad lost in the<br />\nopening -ound to Fredonia<br />\nState, which is a division of<br />\nSUNY, 2-0. The Fredonia team<br />\nwent on to win the Lynchburg<br />\nTournament. \"Staying with that<br />\nvery fine team as long as we did<br />\nwas incredible,\" corm in its coach<br />\nBob Oliver.<br />\nIn the second round the<br />\nbooters lost to Drew University<br />\n4-0. After the contest Oliver<br />\nsaid that the Drew team was a<br />\ntough team to play for second<br />\nplace and that there may have<br />\nbeen something of a letdown.<br />\nAfter going scoreless in the<br />\ntwo tournament games, Hopkins<br />\nbooters have only scored one<br />\ngoal in their past eight.<br />\n<br />\n\"We get some shots,<br />\nbut we have no followup, no<br />\nsecond wave,\" laments Oliver.<br />\nHe added that he may change<br />\nthe midfield before the Towson<br />\nSt. game. However, he does not<br />\npromise a scoring surge. \"The<br />\nchanges may so the trick or they<br />\nmay not. If they don't, we went<br />\nwith something and it didn't<br />\nwork, so we will have to find<br />\nsomething else,\" explains Oliver.<br />\nOliver also believes that the<br />\nlack of experienced players hurts<br />\nthe team. Of the 22 players on<br />\nthe squad, there are only two<br />\nseniors and four juniors.<br />\nLooking towards the near<br />\nfuture, Oliver believes that the<br />\nteam must play a lot to improve.<br />\nHe also says the squad must<br />\nkeep its errors to a minimum.<br />\nThe strongest opponents<br />\nthat Oliver foresees for this<br />\n<br />\nseason are Ursinus, which has ton College.<br />\neight players returning to a team<br />\nAs for the distant future,<br />\nthat defeated Hopkins last year, the coach hopes that the team<br />\nWestern Maryland, and Washing- will improve greatly.<br />\n<br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nSaturday, Sept. 27<br />\nWomen's Cross Country r.

This means<br />\nthe relatively new Hopkins<br />\nsquad must compete against<br />\nmajor water polo, powers such as<br />\nBucknell, Cornell, and Slippery<br />\nRock. Of this obstacle,<br />\nChedekel says, \"Hopkins is<br />\ncoming along very well to be a<br />\nDivision I team. We are in<br />\ntransition between Division I<br />\nand II.\" Assistant Coach<br />\nSummers adds, \"We are<br />\nimproving and will continue to<br />\nimprove. If you step up the<br />\ncompetition, you have to get<br />\nbetter.\"<br />\nThe team's first home<br />\ntournament is October 4 and 5.<br />\nChedekel thinks Hopkins will<br />\nbe competitive against the<br />\nNavy and the Universtiy of<br />\nRichmond.

JOHNSON<br />\nThe Blue Jay football<br />\nseason got off to a rocky start<br />\nlast Saturday as the division<br />\nchampion Widener Pioneers<br />\ndefeated Johns Hopkins 48-7.<br />\nA combination of powerful<br />\nPioneer running and well-executed fakes and hand-offs<br />\nhelped Widener to penetrate<br />\nthe Jay defense repeatedly,<br />\nwhile Hopkins ball carriers<br />\ncould hardly break through the<br />\nWidener line. Hopkins, unable<br />\nto coordinate its passing<br />\nattempts for most of the game,<br />\nrelied heavily on a running<br />\nattack which proved unsuccessful against the Pioneers.<br />\n<br />\nHal Johnson of Widener<br />\nscored a touchdown on the<br />\nfirst Pioneer possession of the<br />\ngame wiien he cruised through<br />\na hole in the Hopkins line. On<br />\nthe next Hopkins possession,<br />\nBruce Kane fumbled the ball<br />\non the Hopkins 25-yard line,<br />\nand Widener recovered,scoring<br />\nthe second Pioneer touchdown<br />\na few plays later.<br />\nHopkins quarterback Jim<br />\nMargraff was usually unable to<br />\ncomplete passes to either Bill<br />\nStromberg or wide receiver<br />\nJohn Potthast. In the secon<br />\nquarter, a toss intended for<br />\nStromberg was intercepted by<br />\nWidener safety Tom Deary,<br />\nsetting the stage for the third<br />\n<br />\nPioneer touchdown. A long<br />\ndrive downfield later in the<br />\nsecond quarter gave Widener its<br />\nfourth<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nAt<br />\nhalftime, the score stood at<br />\n28-0 in favor of the Pioneers.<br />\nAfter the half, the Jays<br />\nattacked with more force. A<br />\ndrive early in the third quarter<br />\nput them in scoring position<br />\nuntil a clipping penalty killed<br />\nthe opportunity. Hopkins had<br />\nto punt again, and Widener<br />\nscored another touchdown on<br />\nthe possession. The Pioneers<br />\nthen got in another punch as<br />\nHal Johnson scored his second<br />\ngoal of the game, raising the<br />\nscore to 41-0.<br />\nIn the fourth quarter, the<br />\n<br />\nJays put their only tally on the<br />\nboard. Mike Miller intercepted<br />\na Widener pass at the Hopkins<br />\n41-yard line and the Jays<br />\nmoved the ball downfield. Jim<br />\nMargraff, injured in the third<br />\nquarter, was replaced by<br />\nfreshman quarterback John<br />\nBevilacqua, who gave an impressive debut performance.<br />\nBevilacqua completed passes to<br />\nboth Stromberg and tight end<br />\nRandy Scholl for the only<br />\nfruitful Jay attack.<br />\nThe<br />\nHopkins touchdown was scored on a pass caught by<br />\nPotthast.<br />\nThe Jays threatened again<br />\nin the final minutes of the<br />\nfourth quarter, bringing the<br />\n<br />\nball to a first-and-goal with<br />\nfifteen seconds remaining in<br />\nthe game. Widener held tight,<br />\nthough, and Hopkins was prevented from scoring as the<br />\nclock ran out.<br />\nDespite their lackluster<br />\nperformance against the Pioneers, the Jays could not count<br />\nthe game as a total loss.<br />\nWidener dominates Division Ill<br />\nfootball play year after year,<br />\nalmost the same way Hopkins<br />\ndominates in Lacrosse. While<br />\nstarting out the season against<br />\nthe toughest opponent may be<br />\ndemoralizing, it also helps<br />\npoint out early season mistakes<br />\nin time to correct them.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAR4g giEWEVBW146, 1980<br />\n<br />\nWI.Ili aMh.liallt drera<br />\n<br />\nlaa 4,1111<br />\n<br />\n40,1111.111.1.401.1.01begrIV<br />\n<br />\nHairdressers, Hardware,Hitmen...<br />\n<br />\nAssassin: The Games That People Play<br />\nWhile rolling across the<br />\nbeautiful Homewood campus<br />\nlast week, mine eyes were caught<br />\nby a strange poster which read<br />\n\"Want Revenge?

But even before deliberating over the choices put<br />\nforth, we must ask one fundamental -yet too often ignored question: do we, the students,<br />\nneed to accept any constitution,<br />\nand thus legitimize the council,<br />\nor should we recognize the<br />\ncouncil as dispensable, not fulfilling its basic promises to the<br />\nstudents, and thus abolish it?<br />\nBefore passing judgement<br />\non the worthiness of the council,<br />\nhowever, we must establish<br />\nexactly what we expect of it.<br />\nWithout a doubt, there exists<br />\nbut a sole purpose of the council: to act as a voice for the<br />\nstudent body: to expound the<br />\nviews of students, guard the<br />\nstudent interests, and to encourage student debate. Yes, the<br />\nCouncil has other functions:<br />\nacting as an administrative body,<br />\nrepresenting the student body at<br />\nceremonial functions, as well as<br />\npacifying those who couldn't<br />\nbear not having some sort of<br />\ngovernment - however specious hanging over their heads; but,<br />\nnone of these can be said to<br />\ncreate the basic justification of<br />\nthe Council's existence. A true<br />\nstudent council would be a voice<br />\nto all:<br />\nan medium through<br />\nwhich students could exchange<br />\nviews and reach other students; a<br />\nspearhead of student relations<br />\nwith the faculty and administration; and a platform for expressing student views on current<br />\nissues to the outside world.<br />\nUnfortunately, our so-called<br />\nstudent council communicates<br />\ndirectly with no one but itself.<br />\nWhen students cannot identify<br />\ntheir own representatives - and<br />\noften not even their president;<br />\nwhen over one half of the<br />\nstudent body regularly fails to<br />\nvote - and when they do,\"none<br />\nof the above\" has been known<br />\nto carry elections; when council<br /><br />\ndebates seem limited to interpretations of Robert's Rules of<br />\nOrder, and any action emanating<br />\nfrom the council results purely<br />\nfrom in-fighting; when the council sits idle, refusing to take a<br />\nstand; in short, when the council<br />\nproves itself impotent and the<br />\nstudents could care less, what<br />\nright to existance can the<br />\nIf today's<br />\ncouncil claim?<br />\ncouncil cannot fulfill the basic<br />\nfunctions of a true student<br />\ncouncil, then we must not<br />\nfool ourselves into believing that<br />\nwe are adequately governed.<br />\nAnd when we are not adequately<br />\ngoverned, it remains our duty as<br />\nvoters to show our disapproval<br />\nand abolish the council as a<br />\nwhole.<br />\nOf course, many will contend that while the Council has<br />\nproblems, it would be rash to<br />\nabolish it now. But when should<br />\nwe decide to leave our paranoia<br />\nof decisive change and opt for<br />\naction? The Council has existed<br />\nfor years, and has consistently,<br />\nand adamantly, separated itself<br />\nfrom true student politics bringing its seclusion to an<br />\nuntenable absurdity when it<br />\ninvoked secret meetings. Every<br />\nyear new representatives have<br />\nbeen elected, every year new<br />\nconstitutions were possible, yet<br />\nno true change has ever occurred. It becomes obvious that it<br />\nis not the council members, or<br />\nhow they mold the system of<br />\ngovernment which is at fault,<br />\nbut the basic framework within<br />\nwhich they work. In order to<br />\nestablish a system which we feel<br />\nwill be responsible to student<br />\nneeds, we must first strip the<br />\ndefunct council of all legitimacy,<br />\nor it will cling to its power of<br />\ntradition and custom, and hinder<br />\nany effort to build a new system. As each year only proves<br />\nonce again, that no change in the<br />\ntype and quality of governing<br />\nwill ever occur within the<br />\nexisting system, it appears that<br />\nthe rash action would not be to<br />\ntear down the old', in order to<br /><br />\ncould get. Although bursts of<br />\nclapping and boos erupted during the debates, those who<br />\nremained in the sultry ,stuffy hall<br />\nto await Anderson could muster<br />\nup only perfunctory, sporadic<br />\ndemonstrations of support.<br />\nThe trim and wrapping on<br />\nthe package did not cover the<br />\nlack of confidence and enthusiasm in both camps; rather, it<br />\ntypified the prevalent aura of<br />\nnostalgia. Snatches of conversation ranged from \"Remember<br />\nAdlai Stevenson?\" to \"I was a<br />\nMcGovern man back in '72\",<br />\nwhile discussions of the candidates themselves centered mainly on a peculiar form of<br />\none-up-manship, e.g. \"You may<br />\nhave joined the campaign two<br />\nyears ago, but my father is close<br />\nfriends with the number-two<br />\nman in our district.\"<br />\nIf the intent of the rally was<br />\nto raise the spirits and insure<br />\nthe votes of supporters, it failed<br />\nmiserably. Many former campaign workers returned home<br />\nwondering what they had ever<br />\nseen in their candidate in the<br />\nfirst place. The general sentiment was expressed in a joke<br />\nwhich quickly made the rounds:<br />\n\"Did you hear who won the<br />\ndebates? Carter.\" When the<br />\nPresidency of the United States<br />\ncan be won by refusing to<br />\nparticipate, our system will have<br />\nreached a sorry state.<br /><br />\nLerner,Steele to Submit Proposals<br />\ncont. from p.1<br />\nIn a very controversial decision, last year's Council voted<br />\nto invalidate the referendum in<br />\nwhich Proposal B won. When<br />\nthe current Council took office<br />\nlast May, it voted to condemn<br />\nthe invalidation but did not<br />\nrescind the decision. Current SC<br />\npresident Michael Steele explained, \"We did not have the<br />\nauthority to overturn the decision. We lacked the procedure.\"<br />\nSteele authorized the writing of a new draft, called Proposal C, over the summer. According to Steele, C is a compromise<br />\nproposal containing the best of<br />\nboth A and B.<br />\nAt first glance, Proposal C is<br />\nquite similar to the rejected<br />\nProposal A. Many of the sections are almost identical. However, there are some substantial<br />\nalterations.<br />\nProposal C has incorporated<br />\nsections of Proposal B such as<br />\nthose which require open meetings and allow any qualified<br />\nstudent to chair any of the six<br />\nmajor committees. The basic<br />\ndifferences between Proposals B<br />\nand C are:<br />\na) Proposal C does not<br />\nrequire mandatory roll call<br />\nvotes.<br />\nb) Proposal B requires SC<br />\nmembers who sit on joint<br />\ncommittees with the administration to attempt to make their<br />\nmeetings open to the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nc) Proposal B prohibits the<br />\nSC president to vote on the SAC<br />\ncommittee<br />\nd) Proposal B makes it<br />\neasier to impeach an officer.<br /><br />\nHarry Lerner, author of<br />\nProposal B who currently<br />\nattends law school, has contended that the administration's<br />\nproposal makes the student<br />\ncouncil unaccountable to the<br />\nstudent body. He is afraid<br />\nthat Proposal C's elections<br />\ncommission (all new proposals<br />\nhave included an<br />\nelections<br />\ncommission) will too easily be<br />\nable to invalidate impeachment<br />\nreferenda. Lerner also protests<br />\nproposal A and C's refusal to<br />\ndistribute copies of the Constitution to all students.<br />\nMike Steele feels that Proposal B is \"inoperable\" and will<br />\nseverely strain relations with the<br />\nadministration. He feels that<br />\nit will be too easy to impeach<br />\nofficials. In response to Lemer's<br />\nproposal to distribute copies of<br />\nthe constitution Steele replied,<br />\n\"Harry has no sense of what a<br />\nbudget is and what things cost.\"<br />\nOn August 15, Harry Lerner<br />\nsent a memo to the Student<br />\nCouncil in which he raised<br />\nseveral objections. In addition<br />\nto criticizing several SC members<br />\nby name, he argued that the<br />\nformer SC invalidation should be<br />\nrescinded and that no new<br />\nadditions to the referendum<br />\nshould be allowed.<br />\nSteele has refused to respond<br />\nto Lerner's memo.<br />\n\"Harry is a student who has<br />\ngraduated,\" he explained. \"I<br />\nhave no intention of answering<br />\nHarry's memo. He has no say in<br />\nwhat we do here at the university.\"<br />\nLerner also requested in his<br />\nmemo that he be reimbursed for<br />\nhis expenses in advertising his<br /><br />\nproposal. Steele asserts that the<br />\ncurrent constitution contains no<br />\nprovision requiring him to do so.<br />\nJim Hoelz, chairman of the<br />\ntemporary Elections Commission, said that when a separate<br />\nelections commission is finally<br />\nestablished students will be<br />\nreimbursed, up to a certain<br />\namount, for advertising their<br />\nproposal.<br />\nOne of Lerner's arguments<br />\nis that if the council has the<br />\npower to rescind its support of<br />\nProposal A in favor of Proposal<br />\nC, it also has the power to<br />\nrescind the invalidation of the<br />\noriginal election. To this claim<br />\nSteele responded, \"Because Proposal A was passed in Council,<br />\nnot by the student body through<br />\nreferendum, that proposal is still<br />\nsupported by the Council regardless of the fact that it was<br />\nproduced by a previoes council.<br />\nThe distinguishing point is this:<br />\nit did not reach student referendum because it was invalidated.<br />\n\"Therefore if it had passed<br />\nstudent referendum and we<br />\nwanted to make changes, we'd<br />\nhave to go through referendum<br />\nagain. Because it didn't get that<br />\nfar, this Council felt it couldn't<br />\nsupport Proposal A the way it<br />\nwas written. What we've done is<br />\nrescind our support of Proposal<br />\nA which means as a council we<br />\ndon't feel that the proposal best<br />\nserves the students.\"<br />\nHoelz noted the situation<br />\nwould never had occurred if a<br />\nseparate elections commission<br />\nhad already existed, for with the<br />\npresence of a commission the SC<br />\nwould not have had the power<br />\nto rescind any election.<br /><br />\nPAGE 6/ SEPTEMBER 26, 1980<br /><br />\nMSE Symposium<br />\ncont. from p.1<br />\nOctober 22nd, is the U.S.<br />\nSurgeon General and editor of<br />\nCurrents in American Medicine.<br />\nSociologist and author of<br />\nThe Real Majority, Ben Wattenberg is scheduled to speak<br />\nOctober 27th on \"The Social<br />\nCrisis: Withdrawal from Society\".

Ever sensitive to popular<br />\nopinion, the Council promised<br />\nreform and undertook to rewrite<br />\nthe Student Constitution.<br />\nThey drafted a set of<br />\namendments, known as Proposal<br />\nA, and scheduled a referendum<br />\nat the end of the semester in<br />\norder to win the requisite<br />\nratification by the student body.<br />\nBut, lo and behold, the changes<br />\nwere anything but benign: hidden under all the _verbiage were<br />\nprovisions designed to make the<br />\nCouncil still more secretive and<br />\nless accountable to the student<br />\nbody!!<br />\nIncensed by this transparent<br />\npower-grab. I drafted an alternate set of constitutional<br />\namendments, Proposal B, and<br />\nhad it placed on the referendum<br />\nballot by student petition. Proposal B would close loopholes in<br />\nthe existing Student Constitution which have been exploited<br />\nby the Council, and restore<br />\ngovernifient of the students, by<br />\nthe students, and (expecially)<br />\nfor the students.<br />\nOne very reasonable requirement already in the Student Constitution is that \"in<br />\nconducting referenda,\" the Student Council's elections \"committee shall afford all parties fair<br />\nopportunity to present their<br />\narguments.- But so enraged<br />\nwere the politicos by my attempt to foil their petty scheme<br />\nthat they defied the Constitution and refused to underwrite<br />\npublication of any ballot measure except their own. Indeed,<br />\nthey drew upon student funds<br />\nand spent well over three hundred dollars to publish and<br />\npromote Proposal A. Relying on<br />\na door-to-door campaign, articles<br />\nand letters in the News-Letter,<br />\nand the good sense of the<br />\nelectorate, I spent just thirtyeight dollars on behalf of Proposal B.<br />\nSurprise, surprise! On the<br />\nday of the referendum, the<br />\nstudent body endorsed Proposal<br />\nB by a margin of almost three to<br />\none. Only then another peculiar<br />\nthing happened...<br />\nThe Council, which just one<br />\nweek before had maliciously<br />\nevaded its own duty to distribute copies of Proposal B, took<br />\nnote of the referendum results<br />\nand invented the theory that the<br />\nlittle girls and boys of Johns<br />\nHopkins hadn't really known<br />\nwhat they were voting for.<br />\n(Considering the scoundrels we<br />\nelected to office, maybe they<br />\nwere right!) At their last meeting of the year, warmed by<br />\nspirits from a brown paper bag,<br />\nthe members of the Council<br />\ndecided to stick it to the student<br />\nbody and declared the referendum null and void.<br />\nEnter the 1980-81 Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe new officers<br />\nunanimously declared that the<br />\ninvalidation of the referendum<br />\nhad been wrong but, claiming<br />\nprocedural difficulties, refused<br />\nto rescind the action.

I was speed-reading the flap of one of the<br />\nbooks as I shelved it. 6:02; 13 minutes to go. Then I<br />\nwould emerge for the last time into the cool of a 98<br />\ndegree dusk. Washing away the last of the book dust at<br />\nthe basin upstairs would be a spiritual rebirth, a shedding<br />\nof skin. I dwelled in a reverie of the joyful schooll days<br />\nto come, the welcome chill of fall in Baltimore. Time<br />\nwould begin to count itself in hours instead of minutes.<br />\n12 minutes and 30 seconds more.<br />\n\"Getting in some reading on your last day?\"<br />\nThe store's truck driver was watching me from the end<br />\nof the aisle. \"You people think you can just come in<br />\nhere for a summer job and then leave, go off to some<br />\nfancy John Hopkins University.\" He chuckled, his belly<br />\nquivering with the secret knowledge of my future.<br />\n\"You'll never make it in the real world out there .\"<br />\nHe pointed upwards at the pipe-tangled ceiling. \"You'll<br />\nbe back in a year, hungry with hat in hand, begging a<br />\njob.\" He walked away, leaving me the stunned recipient<br />\nof his wisdom. I had thought the Strand was the real<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe Lure of the Strand<br />\nBefore you read any more of this article, spread<br />\n200 copies of the News-Letter, open to the fold, across<br />\nyour living room floor. Imagine for a moment that<br />\nevery letter of every linee is the spine of a book and that<br />\nyour eyes are traveling across shelf after shelf of these<br />\nbooks. When your eyes have moved across every line of<br />\nall 200 copies of this article, you will have looked at as<br />\nmany letters as there are books at the Strand Book<br />\nStore. In fact, if you lined up every book side by side,<br />\nthe row would stretch from the World Trade Center to<br />\nthe doorstep of Harlem. This makes the Strand probably the largest used book store in the world. There are<br />\nsome people working there who know every book.<br />\nThe Strand sits on the dingy, well-trafficked<br />\ncorner of 12th and Broadway, and looks from the<br />\noutside as if it could hold barely one tenth its number of<br />\nbooks. The store is about fifty years old. It was named<br />\nafter the Strand in London, a street which has historically been a marketplace for used and rare b000ks. New<br />\nYork's Strand was originally one of a number of such<br />\nstores in the area (Abbey Books, 8th Street Bookstore),<br />\nmost of which are now out of businesss. The Strand<br />\nhas expanded and thrived partly because of its collection<br />\nof reviewer's copies of new books sold for half of list<br />\nprice and its international mail order service (free<br />\nshipping to anywhere in the world).<br />\nTo my friends and me, as we contemplated a<br />\nsummer in Greenwich Village, it seemed a stimulating<br />\nplace to work. After all, didn't we all love books?<br />\nAnd didn't the Strand's bustling main floor<br />\nwith its creaking floors, its whirring fans, and its tweedy<br />\ncustomers evoke the browser's dream of a 19th century<br />\nbookstore? There is always a bag lady or two sorting<br />\nthhrough the paperbaacks, and the employees are figures<br />\nresembling, among others, Vincent Van Gogh and Wally<br />\nCleaver.<br />\nFor almost all the employees, the Strand is a way<br />\nof making money rather than a career. Most of them are<br /><br />\naitists who work at the store because ideally it's a job<br />\nthat doesn.'t distract them or fatigue them from their<br />\nreal work. At the Strand, you may find a truck driver<br />\nwho is awell respected sculptor, a playwright shelving a<br />\npaperback copy of his own play, or a punk keyboardist<br />\ntyping up a book order slip. In many ways the Strand<br />\nhas been the cradle of punk; Patty Smith, Richard Hell,<br />\nRobin Crutchfield' (DNA, Dark Day), and Jody Harris<br />\n(Contortions, Ray Beats) once worked or are still<br />\nworking there. To get an idea of the kind of people who<br />\nshop at the Strand,leaf through a copy of Self-Portraits,<br />\nby former Strand employee Burt Britton. When he ran<br />\nthe Review Section (new books), he asked hundreds of<br />\nwriters who dropped by, many of them major figures in<br />\nthe American literary world, to draw pictures of themselves. I never met any of these illustrious men of letters<br />\nwhile I was working, but perhaps I just didn't recognize<br />\nthem from their drrawings.<br />\nIn a word, the Strand was charming. It appealed<br />\nto all of my vague, romantic feelings about what<br />\nGreenwich Village was supposed to b( It was also the<br />\nonly summer job to be found in the city.<br />\nSo, in January, we all trooped in,one after the<br />\nother, hat and resume in hand, and<br />\ncompliant smile<br />\naffizixed to our scribbed faces. I was the last one, the<br />\nfourth Writing Seminars major from Johns Hopkins,<br />\nciting the same acquaintance who had worked there the<br />\nyear before, and denying any knowledge of the other<br />\nthree who came before.<br />\nThe Strand's owner, Mr. Bass, looked at me<br />\nsuspiciously from over the gold rims of his bifocals. His<br />\nhead was just visible over a monstrous pile of leather<br />\nbound volumes. Wow, I thought, someone's library of<br />\nfirst editions. Stepping into view my prospective employer tucked a gold railroad watch into the pocket of<br />\nhis vest.<br />\n\"Fill this out,\" he said. He handed me a form.<br />\n\"It's a little test.\"<br />\nI put down the usual information: name,<br />\naddress, number. Section II was matching authors with<br />\ntheir books. Who wrote the Rhyme of the Ancient<br />\nMariner? A tale of Two Cities; Dickens wasn't on the<br />\nlist. Must be a trick question. The owner frowned over<br />\nmy finished work.<br />\n\"The job might entail some heavy work.\" He<br />\neyed my biceps, which fortunately were shrouded in one<br />\nof my father's sweaters. \"Well, you applied so early, I<br />\nguess I have to accept you.\" He sighed. The hours were<br />\n9:15 to 6:15, with one unpaid hour for lunch. The store<br />\nwas closed on Sundays. I would be given a day off.<br />\nI shook hands and bowed my way to the cc door<br />\nwhere my friends waited with their collars turned up and<br />\nhats pulled down. We were sure he suspected something.<br />\nFirst Days: Down in Review<br />\nThe first thing that a summer employee does in<br />\nthe morning is pull the long-handled broomes out of the<br />\nmen's room vestibule and sweep all the floors. Without this daily sweeping, the dust situation would grow<br />\nout of control; besides, Mr. Bass hates the noise of<br />\nvacuum cleaners. Psychologically this task reminds the<br />\nworker that he is new and inexperienced, and build<br />\ninhim a respect and envy for his seniors, who, besides not<br />\nhaving to sweep, have the added priviledge of arriving at<br />\n9:30 instead of 9:15. Many have found sweeping<br />\ndistasteful and demeaning, but I enjoyed it:<br />\nMy next job was in Review. The idea here is that<br />\nthe book reviewers, or anyone who can get their hands<br />\non new books for free, bring them into the store and sell<br />\nthem at the desk. Chet Flippo describes this process<br />\nfrom the reviewer's point of view in a recent Rolling<br />\nStone article:<br />\n...every Saturday afternnoon you ccan see every lowrent<br />\nbook rreviewer in Manhattan struggling in with these D'A gostino<br />\nchopping bags MI of review copies -- Scruples-- staggering down<br />\nthe metal stairs into the basement and weaving through the<br />\naisles -- tachycardia time! -to finally dump these goddamn<br />\nshopping bags MI of hooks tehey've heaved and carried all the<br />\nway down from West Ninety-Sixth Street, the goddamn ba bags<br />\nripping and The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet falling out on<br />\nthe goddamn sidewalk there at Twelfth and Broadway, so they<br />\nscoop it up and finally dump all these goddamn books on the<br />\n.floor there at the back of the Strand's basement in front of this<br />\nrope they have stretched across there, and they avert their eyes<br />\nand try to look literary, bug-eyed and wheezing and army navy<br />\nturtlenecked and Frye-hooted, real Levied literary -- while some<br />\ngoddamn pustular NY U major behind the rope takes his goddamn sweet time to sift through the hound detritus...<br /><br />\nw-rent book reviewers:<br />\nthey try to look literary, bug-eyed and wheezing.<br /><br />\nAnyway the eager summer employee is<br />\nsupposed to grab these books out of the boxes and put<br />\nthem on the shelves in alphabetical order as fast as<br />\npossible. The 2' by 3' boxes of books to be shelved pile<br />\nup to the celing. Eventually you slow down because it<br />\nwill take you days to shelve what the store has bought<br />\non one busy afternoon.<br />\nSoon the shelves are filling up too. When you<br />\ncan't fit a book on the shelf, you pack it away in<br />\nanother set of 2' by 3' boxes called SNR (shelving no<br />\nroom). These are dated, alphabetized and piled up against<br />\nthe back wall behind the Review section. They also get<br />\nstacked up to the ceiling, leaving an aisle about one foot<br /><br />\nwide to walk in. Never look up. You'll think the sky is<br />\nfalling on your head.<br />\nSometimes shelving was so tight you just took<br />\nthe books out of one box, rearranged them and put<br />\nthem into another. An exercize in futility, perhaps; but<br />\nthey tell me that because of my work, someday these<br />\nbooks will be sold. There are customers out there who<br />\nwant these books. The authors smile symmpathetically<br />\noff the covers of their books: Dozing it it the Wild Way,<br />\nThis I Believe, Me. How I S Stay Beautiful, Eat Your<br />\nShitty Parts. I guess it's all worth it.<br />\nAs if in punishment, there would be boxes of<br />\nbooks that, by some cruel quirk in the alphabet or a plot<br />\nby the author of Gold Dust Twins, all belong on the top<br />\nshelf. There is never a ladder r in the aisle so I have to<br />\nhunt for one. I carry the metal ladder on my back in<br />\nand oout of the aisles excusing myself to customers.<br />\nThe ladder is wide. Excuseme. Excuesme. Excueseme.<br />\nI step out of the way of someone's kid, and the sharp leg<br />\nof the ladder rips the jackets off a whole row of books.<br />\nI pretend I didn't notice while the browsers stare .knives<br />\nin my back.

If the production of a great<br />\nliterary work calls for crowd scenes, then<br />\nyour TV screen is sure to be filled with a<br />\nconvincingly costumed throng; if it calls<br />\nfor the outdoors, then the landscape will<br />\nbe breath-taking; if the decor is of a<br />\ncertain period (as it always it), there will<br />\nnot be a single goblet out'of character.<br />\nThis concern for authentic and<br />\nimpressive appearance makes many<br />\nMasterpiece Theatre productions guaranteed good enterainment even before the<br />\nacting is taken into consideration.

The four-part series,<br />\nwhich will begin this Sunday evening at<br />\nnine p.m. on channel 6, Maryland Center<br />\nfor Public Broadcasting, certainly has<br />\nconvincing Russian crowds, and oppressive Petersburg atmosphere. Nevertheless,<br />\nit must focus entirely upon its central<br />\ncharacter, the self-tortured student-recluse Raskolnikov. The story's complex<br />\npsychological plot cannot be conveyed by<br />\nextensive action, dialogue, or attention to<br />\nphysical detail. The viewer depends on<br />\nthe face of Raskolnikov, as the murderer<br />\nwanders slowly about St. Petersburt or<br />\nstands stock still in his garret, lost in<br />\nthought, for an understanding of<br />\nDoestoyevsky's novel. Thus the burden<br />\nof the production is borne entirely by<br />\nthe actors.<br />\nJohn Hurt (Caligula in BBC's<br /><br />\nClaudius and co-star in Midnight Ex- Marmelodov, while Beatrix Lehman is<br />\npress), playing the role of Raskolnikov, bloodless and detestible as the elderly<br />\npawnbroker.<br />\nAnne Orwin offers a<br />\nmakes the series a success.

Raskolnikov, despite himself, is<br />\nlistening raptly, and his face lights up. A<br />\nmoment later, Marmaledov brings the<br />\nstory to its wretched conclusion, and the<br />\noppression sinks back onto Raskolnikov's<br />\nfeatures, making him a wraith again.<br />\nThus the many long silences and<br />\nstills necessitated by the story are used to<br />\nadvantage.

The squad placed<br />\nsecond in the MAC and second<br />\nin the Division II East Coast<br />\nChampionship. This year, a<br />\nchange in the coaching staff,<br />\nthe graduation of two all-MAC<br />\nplayers, Steve Long and Brian<br />\nKutsunai, and a restructuring<br />\nof the MAC have presented<br />\nsome challenges, but Hopkins<br />\ngood chance of<br />\nstill has a<br />\nwinning the East Coast title.<br />\nMiles Chedekel replaces<br />\n1979 coach Bob Summers,<br />\nwho took the position of<br />\nassistant coach in order to give<br />\nhimself more time to complete<br />\nhis dissertation. Chedekel is a<br />\nprofessor at the 'School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health. He<br />\nplayed water plo as an undergraduate at UCLA, and coached the University of Minnesota<br />\nand Iowa State water polo<br />\nclubs. He then took the same<br />\njob at Ohio State and was<br />\npresident and founder of the<br />\nMid East Water Polo Conference<br />\nThis year's team is relatively young, with captains Wynn<br />\nMcCloskey, a senior, and juni-<br /><br />\nors Jeff Salmore and Craig<br />\nWeinert comprising most of the<br />\nupperclassmen on the team.<br />\nCoach Chedekel said, \"Most of<br />\nour strength is in the underclassmen.<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nand<br />\nsophomores make up the<br /><br />\nnucleus of the team.\" The<br />\nlosses of all-MAC goalie Steve<br />\nLong is felt by the club, but<br />\nChedekel has been very impressed<br />\nwith the new goalie, sophomore Dave Schaefer, in practice.<br /><br />\nAnother challenge faced<br />\nby the club is the reorganization of the MAC. Under the<br />\nnew structure, Divisions I and<br />\nII are merged, with the top<br />\nthree schools in the league<br />\ngoing to the Division I finals,<br /><br />\nPractice makes perfect as the Jay Water Polo squad moves toward Division I competition.<br /><br />\nSoccer Tourney A Disappointment For Jays<br />\nBY JEFF ARONOFF<br />\nThe JHU soccer team did<br />\nnot fare too well in its recent<br />\ntrip to Lynchburg, Virginia.<br />\nThe squad lost in the<br />\nopening -ound to Fredonia<br />\nState, which is a division of<br />\nSUNY, 2-0. The Fredonia team<br />\nwent on to win the Lynchburg<br />\nTournament. \"Staying with that<br />\nvery fine team as long as we did<br />\nwas incredible,\" corm in its coach<br />\nBob Oliver.<br />\nIn the second round the<br />\nbooters lost to Drew University<br />\n4-0. After the contest Oliver<br />\nsaid that the Drew team was a<br />\ntough team to play for second<br />\nplace and that there may have<br />\nbeen something of a letdown.<br />\nAfter going scoreless in the<br />\ntwo tournament games, Hopkins<br />\nbooters have only scored one<br />\ngoal in their past eight.<br /><br />\n\"We get some shots,<br />\nbut we have no followup, no<br />\nsecond wave,\" laments Oliver.<br />\nHe added that he may change<br />\nthe midfield before the Towson<br />\nSt. game. However, he does not<br />\npromise a scoring surge. \"The<br />\nchanges may so the trick or they<br />\nmay not. If they don't, we went<br />\nwith something and it didn't<br />\nwork, so we will have to find<br />\nsomething else,\" explains Oliver.<br />\nOliver also believes that the<br />\nlack of experienced players hurts<br />\nthe team. Of the 22 players on<br />\nthe squad, there are only two<br />\nseniors and four juniors.<br />\nLooking towards the near<br />\nfuture, Oliver believes that the<br />\nteam must play a lot to improve.<br />\nHe also says the squad must<br />\nkeep its errors to a minimum.<br />\nThe strongest opponents<br />\nthat Oliver foresees for this<br /><br />\nseason are Ursinus, which has ton College.<br />\neight players returning to a team<br />\nAs for the distant future,<br />\nthat defeated Hopkins last year, the coach hopes that the team<br />\nWestern Maryland, and Washing- will improve greatly.<br /><br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nSaturday, Sept. 27<br />\nWomen's Cross Country r.

Of this obstacle,<br />\nChedekel says, \"Hopkins is<br />\ncoming along very well to be a<br />\nDivision I team. We are in<br />\ntransition between Division I<br />\nand II.\" Assistant Coach<br />\nSummers adds, \"We are<br />\nimproving and will continue to<br />\nimprove.

JOHNSON<br />\nThe Blue Jay football<br />\nseason got off to a rocky start<br />\nlast Saturday as the division<br />\nchampion Widener Pioneers<br />\ndefeated Johns Hopkins 48-7.<br />\nA combination of powerful<br />\nPioneer running and well-executed fakes and hand-offs<br />\nhelped Widener to penetrate<br />\nthe Jay defense repeatedly,<br />\nwhile Hopkins ball carriers<br />\ncould hardly break through the<br />\nWidener line. Hopkins, unable<br />\nto coordinate its passing<br />\nattempts for most of the game,<br />\nrelied heavily on a running<br />\nattack which proved unsuccessful against the Pioneers.<br /><br />\nHal Johnson of Widener<br />\nscored a touchdown on the<br />\nfirst Pioneer possession of the<br />\ngame wiien he cruised through<br />\na hole in the Hopkins line. On<br />\nthe next Hopkins possession,<br />\nBruce Kane fumbled the ball<br />\non the Hopkins 25-yard line,<br />\nand Widener recovered,scoring<br />\nthe second Pioneer touchdown<br />\na few plays later.<br />\nHopkins quarterback Jim<br />\nMargraff was usually unable to<br />\ncomplete passes to either Bill<br />\nStromberg or wide receiver<br />\nJohn Potthast. In the secon<br />\nquarter, a toss intended for<br />\nStromberg was intercepted by<br />\nWidener safety Tom Deary,<br />\nsetting the stage for the third<br /><br />\nPioneer touchdown. A long<br />\ndrive downfield later in the<br />\nsecond quarter gave Widener its<br />\nfourth<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nAt<br />\nhalftime, the score stood at<br />\n28-0 in favor of the Pioneers.<br />\nAfter the half, the Jays<br />\nattacked with more force. A<br />\ndrive early in the third quarter<br />\nput them in scoring position<br />\nuntil a clipping penalty killed<br />\nthe opportunity. Hopkins had<br />\nto punt again, and Widener<br />\nscored another touchdown on<br />\nthe possession. The Pioneers<br />\nthen got in another punch as<br />\nHal Johnson scored his second<br />\ngoal of the game, raising the<br />\nscore to 41-0.<br />\nIn the fourth quarter, the<br /><br />\nJays put their only tally on the<br />\nboard. Mike Miller intercepted<br />\na Widener pass at the Hopkins<br />\n41-yard line and the Jays<br />\nmoved the ball downfield. Jim<br />\nMargraff, injured in the third<br />\nquarter, was replaced by<br />\nfreshman quarterback John<br />\nBevilacqua, who gave an impressive debut performance.<br />\nBevilacqua completed passes to<br />\nboth Stromberg and tight end<br />\nRandy Scholl for the only<br />\nfruitful Jay attack.<br />\nThe<br />\nHopkins touchdown was scored on a pass caught by<br />\nPotthast.<br />\nThe Jays threatened again<br />\nin the final minutes of the<br />\nfourth quarter, bringing the<br /><br />\nball to a first-and-goal with<br />\nfifteen seconds remaining in<br />\nthe game. Widener held tight,<br />\nthough, and Hopkins was prevented from scoring as the<br />\nclock ran out.<br />\nDespite their lackluster<br />\nperformance against the Pioneers, the Jays could not count<br />\nthe game as a total loss.<br />\nWidener dominates Division Ill<br />\nfootball play year after year,<br />\nalmost the same way Hopkins<br />\ndominates in Lacrosse.
