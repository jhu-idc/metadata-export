Horn,<br />\nChairman of the Mathematical<br />\nSciences Department estimated<br />\nlast November that his<br />\ndepartment would use only<br />\n$44,000 of the $53,000<br />\nbudgeted for instructional use in<br />\nthe current academic year. He<br />\nasked the Dean if he could use<br />\nthe extra $9000 to fund a visiting<br />\nfaculty member for this semester<br />\nbecause the department nad lost<br />\nseveral faculty.<br />\nDr. Horn's judgement was<br />\nbased on past experience with<br />\nrates of computer use.

Homewood House could<br />\nnot provide the full amount, but<br />\n<br />\noffered to split the shortfall with<br />\nthe department.<br />\nThe Deans had expected that<br />\nMathematical Sciences' $9,000<br />\ncontribution would be taken<br />\nfrom a gift fund which it alone<br />\ncontrols. The Department<br />\napparently felt it was<br />\ninappropriate to use such gifts to<br />\nrelieve the squeeze.

The newly -passed<br />\nco nstitutional amendments<br />\nChange the impeachment process<br />\nso that the requisite number<br />\nof<br />\nvoters is determined by set<br />\n<br />\nnumbers rather than by<br />\npercentages. For example, under<br />\nthe old system, twenty percent<br />\nof a class had to bring a petition<br />\nfor impeachment of a class<br />\nofficer. Under the revised system,<br />\nthe same petition can be brought<br />\nby 75 class members. The<br />\namendment also deletes the<br />\nrequirement that at least forty<br />\npercent of the class must vote in<br />\nan impeachment referendum.<br />\nThis proposal passed 254 to 70,<br />\nwith 156 abstentions.<br />\nAnother of the amendments<br />\nimposes a tougher procedure for<br />\nclosing Student Council (S.C.)<br />\nmeetings. Formerly, a 2/3 vote of<br />\nthe Council could close an S.C.<br />\n<br />\nmeeting. Now a unanimous vote<br />\nis required.

Eacii lab<br />\ncosts approximately $100,000 to<br />\nrestore, and labs must be<br />\nrenovated piecemeal because of<br />\nthprohibitive cost. Because of<br />\nlimited funding, Hopkins<br />\nemphasizes restoration more than<br />\nnew construction. \"Structurally,<br />\nthe buildings are in good silope,\"<br />\nCampbell affirms.<br />\nThe University's funding<br />\nsqueeze, unable to maintain the<br />\nbuilding boom of the prosperous<br />\n1960's, also extends to housing.<br />\nAlthough plans for a new<br />\ndomitory receive high priority,<br />\nthe high cost of building is<br />\nprohibitive.

STEiNBERG<br />\nFour years have passed. As a<br />\nmember of the community who<br />\nhas been involved in the politics<br />\nof this university I have<br />\nfrequently come to reflect on<br />\nboth its strengths and<br />\nshortcomings. Thus before<br />\ndeparting from tne hallowed halls<br />\nof Johns Hopkins I feel it<br />\nincumbent to take one last look<br />\nat what nas transpired, and in<br />\naddition what these four years<br />\nhold in store for the future.<br />\nBefore I begin moralizing,<br />\nhowever, two points are in order.<br />\nFirst, \u2022students must certainly<br />\naccept part of tile blame for that<br />\nwhich is Johns Hopkins. For<br />\nalthough we have significantly<br />\nless established power than our<br />\ncounterparts at this university<br />\nour own position is frequently<br />\ncompromised by a lackadaisical<br />\nattitude. The sixties taught us<br />\nthat only through concerted<br />\neffort could a student voice<br />\nbecome a respected force. This<br />\nlesson we have all too quickly<br />\nforgotten. The scurry for jobs<br />\nand the need to excel have<br />\nusurped an important position<br />\nfor the student in academica.<br />\nThey have stealthily robbed<br />\nstudent bodies of a sense of<br />\nself-determination and a will to<br />\naffect change. It is time we<br />\nopenly acknowledge this fact or<br />\nresign ourselves to wallow in the<br />\nreality that confronts us now.<br />\nSecond, the following remarks<br />\nmay to many seem to be gross<br />\ngeneralizations. FOf this I<br />\napologize. Certainly Johns<br />\n<br />\nHopkins nas no single face. It, as<br />\nall other social institutions, is a<br />\ncomplex and multi-faceted<br />\nentity. There is good here, and I<br />\ncan fortunately attest to tile fact<br />\nthat I have seen, lived with, and<br />\nlearned from its various<br />\nmanifestations. My aim is not,<br />\nhowever, to laud wnat exists, but<br />\nin a small way to provide<br />\ncriticisms to add to the greatness<br />\nof this institution; for<br />\nconstructive criticism is certainly<br />\na hallmark of scholarship and<br />\neducation. With apologies for all<br />\ncrudities, doubts, and confusions<br />\nI hope the following may be<br />\naccepted in the spirit in wilich it<br />\nis given.<br />\nIn my tenure at Johns<br />\nHopkins I have been exposed to a<br />\nstartling amount of deceit,<br />\nback-handedness, and petty<br />\npolitical trickery. This politics<br />\nhas often defiled the motto of<br />\nthis University and made a<br />\nshambles of the integrity that is<br />\ntheoretically implicit in<br />\nacademics. Its effect is a chasm<br />\nbetween faculty and<br />\nadministration and students.<br />\nTruth, honesty and sincerity have<br />\nbecome waning concepts, used<br />\nmore frequently with<br />\napprehension and less with<br />\nconfidence. The issues raised over<br />\nthe last four years and their now<br />\nseemingly inevitable outcomes<br />\nhave created a profound sense of<br />\nalienation and distrust among<br />\nstudents towards the faculty and<br />\nadministration. We have come to<br />\nexpect tile worst and this is one<br />\nof tile most disheartening<br />\n<br />\nrealities of Johns Hopkins. Such<br />\ntactics are no way to govern a<br />\nuniversity, and if present trends<br />\ncontinue students can anticipate<br />\nan insufferable and suffocating<br />\ntendency at this school.<br />\nThis politics would be<br />\ninnocuous if it was simply the<br />\nflexing of egos and an exercise in<br />\ncharacter manipulation to which<br />\nwe all fall prey. Yet the reality is<br />\nquite the opposite for political<br />\nfighting is an insidious and<br />\ncancerous force which eats at the<br />\nvery core of this University\u2014the<br />\nideals of education. To say that<br />\nthis institution nas misplaced<br />\ncertain educational values is a<br />\npitiful understatement. The<br />\npresent system of tenure<br />\nconsciously neglects the value of<br />\ncompetent teaching, and to say<br />\notherwise is a reproachable lie.<br />\nFor one of tile most respected<br />\nuniversities in this country this is<br />\na staggering disgrace. Yet the<br />\ntenure system is symptomatic of<br />\na larger degeneration. Rote<br />\nlearning has become the<br />\nsurrogate of critical thinking, of<br />\nthe expression of ideas, and the<br />\nmore difficult exercising of the<br />\nstudents' critical faculties. This<br />\nsystem of instruction is easy for<br />\nthe professional researcher to<br />\naccept tacitly, for it requires far<br />\nless expenditure of time on his<br />\nstudents. It bolsters the<br />\nsacrosanct nature of the lab and<br />\nlibrary and reduces the<br />\nrequirements and necessities Of<br />\nproper teaching.<br />\nCONTD.

And, if<br />\nthey do, additional funds will<br />\naccrue to the University. (c) An<br />\n18 months' moratorium on all<br />\nsalary increases a few years ago<br />\nresulted in no noticeable<br />\nperturbations in the annual<br />\nturnover rate.

We don't have<br />\none option, the administrative<br />\nproposal, but many. Likewise,<br />\neach option should be considered<br />\nas a modifiable option. For<br />\nexample, reduce staff over a<br />\nfive-year period including full<br />\nprofessors and administrators.<br />\nOr, don't declare a moratorium<br />\non increases, but establish a<br />\ngraduated salary increase plan to<br />\nhold for two years, and so on.

Yet he has also<br />\nobtained experience in many fields on the road to<br />\nhis profession; this story is one that should both<br />\namuse and inspire many of today's youth who are<br />\nwondering how to get along in this world.<br />\nDr. Muller was born in Hamburg, Germany in<br />\n1927. His parents were German, and he lived with<br />\nthem and his brother, who is 14 months younger.<br />\nHis father was Jewish, and a Social Democrat as<br />\nwell, and when the Nazi regime took power in<br />\n1933, as Dr. Muller puts it<br />\nlife got nasty.\"<br />\nHis father was arrested by the Nazis in 1938,<br />\nbut managed to be deported to England. His<br />\nmother, brother and he stayed behind in<br />\nHamburg, while Dr. Muller did everything<br />\npossible to arrange to have his family emigrated<br />\nto England. The Muller family left with very few<br />\nposessions on August 12th, 1939, less than three<br />\nweeks before the start of WW II.<br />\nArriving by airplane from Hambrug to London,<br />\nthe Mullers were reunited and settled down in a<br />\npart of London known as St. Johns Wood. The<br />\ntwo brothers started school in St. Johns Wood,\"<br />\nbut as war had broken out, the whole school was<br />\nevacuated to Chesharn<br />\n. in Buckinghamshire.<br />\n\"We were given gas masks,\" Dr. Muller<br />\nrecalled, \"and the whole school was taken onto<br />\nthe train, and we went to Chesham, where the<br />\ntrain was emptied and we all stood around on the<br />\nvillage green, where different families would<br />\nstand around and claim us. Except nobody<br />\nwanted us, because, although we had good<br />\nschooling in Germany, were obviously fluent in<br />\nGerman, had both had French in school, and I<br />\nknew Greek and Latin, we didn't speak English!<br />\nFortunately, a childless couple named Scull took<br />\nus, so we lived with them, and learned English by<br />\npointing at things. This was fine, except that after<br />\na couple of months, my brother and I were fluent<br />\nin English, but sounded like little Englishmen.\"<br />\nIn April of 1940, the American visa which Mr.<br />\nMuller had applied for four years earlier in<br />\nGermany came through. Although the Mullers<br />\nwere relatively low on the list of applicants, they<br />\nhad the advantage of being in England, whereas<br />\nmost of the families who had wished to emigrate<br />\nwere still in Germany. The Muller family packed<br />\nup an left lby ship for the United States.<br />\nThey settled in New York initially, where they<br />\nlived with an uncle who had left Germany after<br />\nWorld War One. The two brothers had planned to<br />\nstart school in the fall, Dr. Muller explained,<br />\n\"However, my father, you see, had athsma. Now,<br />\n1940 was before air-conditioning, essentially. The<br />\nsummer in New York was bad, and my father<br />\nreally suffered. He didn't have a job, and when he<br />\nwent to the doctor, he was told to go someplace<br />\nlike Arizona or California. Well, we knew where<br />\nArizona was on the map, but that 'meant nothing.<br />\nIn the Los Angeles area, we knew of a number of<br />\nGerman families, no relatives, but Germans who<br />\nhad left Germany nonetheless. So the doctor said .<br />\nthat was fine, that the climate was good there for<br />\nmy father. In the summer of 1940, then, we all<br />\ngot on a Greyhound but -- we didn't go in one fell<br />\nswoop, incidentally, we did make a number of<br />\nstops \u2014 and eight days later we arrived in<br />\nCaliforn ia.\"<br />\nWhen asked what his first impressions were of<br />\nthe United States, Dr. Muller replied, \"We<br />\ncouldn't believe it. It was impressive, but a little<br />\noverwhelming.\" For a person who had never been<br />\noutside Germany or England, that was quite<br />\nunderstandable.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Muller had some money left, but they had<br />\ncalled, and remember, this is an agent, he now<br />\n\"One day, I was tired, because it was hot we need the part of a midshipman.

The announcer of<br />\nthe show, whom Dr. Muller met a few times after<br />\nhe became famous, was an obscure radio<br />\nahnouncer named Chet Huntley.<br />\nSteven Muller became a regular on The<br />\nHollywood Smarty Party, and so became fairly<br />\nwellknown at KNX. As Dr. Muller pointed out,<br />\n\"Radio, in those days, was fun. It was live, you<br />\ndidn't need any makeup, and there was no school<br />\non Sundays so I didn't have to worry about<br />\nthat.\" Later those Sunday evenings, CBS had<br />\nanother show known as I Was There. As a<br />\nGerman refugee, Muller was vividly interested in<br />\nthe war, and in history as well, and he hung<br />\naround the set to listen to the programs.<br />\n\"What they did,\" Dr. Muller explained, \"was<br />\nto take real-life people who had had interesting<br />\nexperiences, and at the beginning of the show<br />\nthey would introduce these people. They they<br />\nwould dramatize the interesting experience,<br />\nplayed by CBS actors. One of the program<br />\ndirectors then got the idea that they should do<br />\nthe evacuation of the children from London, and<br />\nthat in addition to introducing my brother and<br />\nme at the beginning of the show, we should play<br />\nourselves, because I was an actor!\"So, Steven and<br />\nNorbert Muller played Steven and Norbert Muller<br />\non this half-hour radio show called I Was There,<br />\nsubject: The evacuation of London.<br />\nNorbert Muller is now a professor of Chemistry<br />\nat Purdue, and, according to Dr. Muller,\" He'd be<br />\nhorrified to learn that I'm telling this story.\"<br />\nSometime in 1944, Mr. Muller lost his job at<br />\nthe candy factory and, for some time, the entire<br />\nMuller family was living off the income from<br />\nSteven Muller's various movie and radio jobs.<br />\ndays came in 1945 when the war finally<br />\nended. Mr. Muller got a new job, and the Mullers<br />\nwere no longer considered enemy aliens. Steven<br />\nMuller went to -U.C.L.A., became associate editor<br />\nof the 'Bruin the student newspaner, and majored in<br />\n]iA al. science.<br />\nDot<br />\n'n MGM movie called Battleground<br />\npart in an<br />\nopened up for a German lieutenant, which Steven<br />\nMuller promptly got. By then lie was 17, and<br />\nrunning for student office; he had a decision to<br />\nmake: should he spend a month or two on<br />\nanother movie, or should he call it quits and<br />\npursue his academic interests?<br />\nThe answer is obvious, but perhaps then it was<br />\nnot quite so easy to decide. Certainly today,<br />\nmany college freshmen would think twice if<br />\nchoosing between another 4 to 7 years of<br />\neducation and a possible movie career. Yet Steven<br />\nMuller decided to quit acting and involve himself<br />\nin his studies, and this decision eventually led to<br />\nthe presidency at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAlong the road to his current position, Dr.<br />\nMuller acted in a number of fine movies, such ;Is<br />\nHow Green Was My Valley, with Roddy<br />\nMcDowell, with whom Dr. Muller still retains a<br />\nfriendship, The White Cliffs of Dover, with Peter<br />\n'Lorre, and The Seventh Cross, with the renowned<br />\nSpencer Tracy. He met and was cast with such<br />\ngreats as Liz Taylor, Margaret O'Brien, Jane<br />\nPowell, and Joan Crawford.<br />\nThe amazing story that unfolded in the<br />\ninterview, one which Hollywood script-writers<br />\nwould be hard -put to top, 'ended abruptly as<br />\nPresident Muller rushed off to a meeting.

It's tile<br />\nstory of a progressive upper-class New York City woman<br />\nand tile various crises (of psyche, identity, and libido)<br />\nmat sae experiences after her husband of sixteen years<br />\nleaves tier for another woman. Jill Clayburgh, in the title<br />\nrole, does an admirable acting job, as does the remainder<br />\nof the cast, which includes Michael Murphy as the<br />\nestranged liusbaad and Alan Bates as tile woman's- new<br />\nlover. The problem is that tney're playing characters<br />\ncreated by Paul Mazursky, who wrote and directed the<br />\nmovie. Mazursky, who gave tile world that insipid<br />\nrip-off of Beatlemania known as tile Monkees, aas<br />\nstrange talent for concocting characters that -are neither<br />\nlikable, loVable, nor even hateful. They're merely<br />\nannoying. When they come out with lines that are<br />\nsupposed to be witty or wise, they sound more like<br />\nobnoxious smart-asses. Take for instance the scene in<br />\nWhich E r ica (Clayburgn) is having lunch, with her three<br />\nfriends, who are also progressive upper-class New York<br />\nCity women. One of Erica's friends divulges that site's<br />\n<br />\nhaving an affair with a 19-year-old boy. Another of her<br />\nfriends, cigarette hanging from a limp nand, haughtily<br />\nchimes in, \"Yes, she doesn't know whether to adtipt him<br />\nor fuck him.\" The girls ail have a nauglity little chuckle<br />\nover tins wnile the viewer shifts uneasily in ais seat,<br />\nwincing, \"Uti, yeah. Rignt.\" If Mazursky expects the<br />\nviewer to work Up some kind of feeling for tilese people,<br />\n(other than wishing they'd go away),<br />\n\u2022 ne's asking a..<br />\nawful lot; unless of course tile viewer is iiimseif an<br />\nobnoxious smart-ass.<br />\nAs in Mazursky's flume in Love, tile men in An<br />\nUnmarried +Woman, are portrayed as sex-hungry animals<br />\nwho victimize and humiliate tile stalwart stable women. I<br />\ndon't mean to sound like a Puritan, but not every man is<br />\none big walking errogenous zone, not even in New York.<br />\nMazursky, with this unrealistic depiction of men, wants<br />\nthe viewer to sympathize with Erica, tile poor dear wao's<br />\nforever running from the filthy clutches of the aedonistic<br />\nbeasts--that is, until the pressure becomes too much and<br />\nshe gives in. One migat argue that Mazursky intentionally<br />\nhas these men appear lecherous, to serve ;as a contrast with<br />\nSaul Kaplan (Bates), the man with whom Erica eventually<br />\nfinds some semblance of happiness. But Kaplan is just<br />\nslightly less a lecher than the turkeys that have been<br />\nmaking Erica (and the viewer) nauseous throughout Inc<br />\nmovie.<br />\nThe whole sciimeer is only a couple of notches above<br />\nAs tne World Turns. One gets tile feeling that Mazursky<br />\nabsorbs soaps by day and writes ids movies by aigitt.<br />\nRigat about now, the combination of my being a critic<br />\nand tile austerity of this review is making me feel a little<br />\nguilty. So maybe I should say sometning nice about An<br />\nUnmarried Woman. The nicest tiling 1- can say about tile<br />\n<br />\nfilm, outside of Jill Clayburgii, is the theater I saw it in,<br />\nthe Senator in beautiful downtown GovanS. The building<br />\nitself dates from tile 1940's and still iiouses some of the<br />\ncharm of thiat era. However, he doesn't shell out $3.25<br />\nt o see charming ciaemas. A Moviegoer buys a ticket in<br />\nthe nope of seeing a good movie, whin unfortunately Ali<br />\nUnmarried Woman isn't.<br />\nPerhaps I might nave appreciated and enjoyed Lie<br />\nmovie more if I were recently divorced. For toat matter,<br />\npentads Paul Mazursky might have done a better job ifhe<br />\nwere a recently-divorced woman, which I doubt ae is.<br />\nMaybe ne should make a movie about a silly filmmaker<br />\nwho writes and directs tedious movies about obnoxious<br />\npeople. If familiarity with a subject guarantees success, then Mazursky migat have something there.<br />\n<br />\nEverything's flunky-Dory in New Novel<br />\nThe City Bidders. By George<br />\nKonrad. 184 pages.<br />\nHarcourt, Brace, Jovanovich. $7.95.<br />\nBy MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nThe narrator of this Hungarian novel, a middle-ag<br />\ned<br />\nCity planner in an unnamed<br />\nEaster European city, relates<br />\nIlls fragmented memories of<br />\nthe Second World War, his<br />\nfamily, and his city. When he describes partisan activities<br />\nduring the War, and the rubble left where a city<br />\nonce<br />\nstood, one is reminded of'two German novelists, Gunter<br />\nGrass and Heinrich Boll, for they also have a great<br />\ninterest<br />\nin what the<br />\nlatter has called \"rubble .literature.\" Although<br />\nthe characters in<br />\nmany a Grass or Boll novel, like<br />\nKonrad's narrator, live in contemporary Europe,<br />\nmemories of a thirty-year-old war have remained forever<br />\nimbedded within their mind.<br />\n<br />\nCompounded with these memories are others, among<br />\nthem a richly detailed mental picture of his father's death<br />\nand funeral. His father, a private planner, had built the<br />\npower plant wich kept the city alive for sixty years, but<br />\nthe narrator, a city planner, is about to tear down this<br />\npower plant, one of his father's proudest achievements.<br />\nJust as the son has betrayed the architectural<br />\naccomplishments of his father, he has likewise betrayed<br />\nthe ideals of his -own youth, when, as a social activist at<br />\nthe conclusion of the War, he wanted to build a great new<br />\ncity with the rubble of the old. The revolutionaries of his<br />\ngeneration assumed office and became bureaucrats. City<br />\nplanners, full of architectural ideals in the early years of<br />\nsocialism,!gradually lost<br />\nthese ideals, and their<br />\nachievement, their modern city, \"an eastern European<br />\nshowcase of devastation and reconstruction,\" is<br />\nfunctional, ugly.<br />\n<br />\n\"I wanted to plan a city,\" laments the narrator, \"but<br />\nit<br />\nhad plans for me.\" Having abandoned the achieveme<br />\nnts of<br />\nhis father, as well as nis own ideals, the city planner<br />\naids<br />\nin the construction of a drab, joyless city, full<br />\nof<br />\nmaterialistic inhabitants, living what Konrad describes as<br />\n\"provisional\" lives. This city is not unlike the conformist,<br />\ndispiriting urban nightmare predicted by Jose Ortega Y<br />\nGasset in his The Revolt of the Masses, because Ortega Y<br />\nGasset also speaks of a modern life that \"has become<br />\nscandalously provisional.\"<br />\nThe city planner, of course, feels guilty about the part<br />\nhe played in the construction of such a world, and<br />\nhe<br />\nrealizes, with sadness and cynicism, that the city he<br />\ndesigned has, in a sense, designed him as well.

At<br />\nthe same time, Cornell did play<br />\npotential, which left them<br />\nto<br />\non top.<br />\nCornell received a sound team<br />\neffort which show,:ed all their<br />\n<br />\ncolors, but the Blue Jays did not<br />\nmake it easy for them.

Cornell then put in three<br />\nunanswered goals and held the<br />\nlead from then on.<br />\nDespite the loss several Blue<br />\nJays turned in fine individual<br />\nperformances.

He<br />\nasked the Dean if he could use<br />\nthe extra $9000 to fund a visiting<br />\nfaculty member for this semester<br />\nbecause the department nad lost<br />\nseveral faculty.<br />\nDr. Horn's judgement was<br />\nbased on past experience with<br />\nrates of computer use.

Homewood House could<br />\nnot provide the full amount, but<br /><br />\noffered to split the shortfall with<br />\nthe department.<br />\nThe Deans had expected that<br />\nMathematical Sciences' $9,000<br />\ncontribution would be taken<br />\nfrom a gift fund which it alone<br />\ncontrols.

The newly -passed<br />\nco nstitutional amendments<br />\nChange the impeachment process<br />\nso that the requisite number<br />\nof<br />\nvoters is determined by set<br /><br />\nnumbers rather than by<br />\npercentages. For example, under<br />\nthe old system, twenty percent<br />\nof a class had to bring a petition<br />\nfor impeachment of a class<br />\nofficer. Under the revised system,<br />\nthe same petition can be brought<br />\nby 75 class members.

STEiNBERG<br />\nFour years have passed. As a<br />\nmember of the community who<br />\nhas been involved in the politics<br />\nof this university I have<br />\nfrequently come to reflect on<br />\nboth its strengths and<br />\nshortcomings. Thus before<br />\ndeparting from tne hallowed halls<br />\nof Johns Hopkins I feel it<br />\nincumbent to take one last look<br />\nat what nas transpired, and in<br />\naddition what these four years<br />\nhold in store for the future.<br />\nBefore I begin moralizing,<br />\nhowever, two points are in order.<br />\nFirst, \u2022students must certainly<br />\naccept part of tile blame for that<br />\nwhich is Johns Hopkins. For<br />\nalthough we have significantly<br />\nless established power than our<br />\ncounterparts at this university<br />\nour own position is frequently<br />\ncompromised by a lackadaisical<br />\nattitude. The sixties taught us<br />\nthat only through concerted<br />\neffort could a student voice<br />\nbecome a respected force. This<br />\nlesson we have all too quickly<br />\nforgotten. The scurry for jobs<br />\nand the need to excel have<br />\nusurped an important position<br />\nfor the student in academica.<br />\nThey have stealthily robbed<br />\nstudent bodies of a sense of<br />\nself-determination and a will to<br />\naffect change. It is time we<br />\nopenly acknowledge this fact or<br />\nresign ourselves to wallow in the<br />\nreality that confronts us now.<br />\nSecond, the following remarks<br />\nmay to many seem to be gross<br />\ngeneralizations. FOf this I<br />\napologize. Certainly Johns<br /><br />\nHopkins nas no single face. It, as<br />\nall other social institutions, is a<br />\ncomplex and multi-faceted<br />\nentity. There is good here, and I<br />\ncan fortunately attest to tile fact<br />\nthat I have seen, lived with, and<br />\nlearned from its various<br />\nmanifestations. My aim is not,<br />\nhowever, to laud wnat exists, but<br />\nin a small way to provide<br />\ncriticisms to add to the greatness<br />\nof this institution; for<br />\nconstructive criticism is certainly<br />\na hallmark of scholarship and<br />\neducation. With apologies for all<br />\ncrudities, doubts, and confusions<br />\nI hope the following may be<br />\naccepted in the spirit in wilich it<br />\nis given.<br />\nIn my tenure at Johns<br />\nHopkins I have been exposed to a<br />\nstartling amount of deceit,<br />\nback-handedness, and petty<br />\npolitical trickery. This politics<br />\nhas often defiled the motto of<br />\nthis University and made a<br />\nshambles of the integrity that is<br />\ntheoretically implicit in<br />\nacademics. Its effect is a chasm<br />\nbetween faculty and<br />\nadministration and students.<br />\nTruth, honesty and sincerity have<br />\nbecome waning concepts, used<br />\nmore frequently with<br />\napprehension and less with<br />\nconfidence. The issues raised over<br />\nthe last four years and their now<br />\nseemingly inevitable outcomes<br />\nhave created a profound sense of<br />\nalienation and distrust among<br />\nstudents towards the faculty and<br />\nadministration. We have come to<br />\nexpect tile worst and this is one<br />\nof tile most disheartening<br /><br />\nrealities of Johns Hopkins. Such<br />\ntactics are no way to govern a<br />\nuniversity, and if present trends<br />\ncontinue students can anticipate<br />\nan insufferable and suffocating<br />\ntendency at this school.<br />\nThis politics would be<br />\ninnocuous if it was simply the<br />\nflexing of egos and an exercise in<br />\ncharacter manipulation to which<br />\nwe all fall prey. Yet the reality is<br />\nquite the opposite for political<br />\nfighting is an insidious and<br />\ncancerous force which eats at the<br />\nvery core of this University\u2014the<br />\nideals of education. To say that<br />\nthis institution nas misplaced<br />\ncertain educational values is a<br />\npitiful understatement. The<br />\npresent system of tenure<br />\nconsciously neglects the value of<br />\ncompetent teaching, and to say<br />\notherwise is a reproachable lie.<br />\nFor one of tile most respected<br />\nuniversities in this country this is<br />\na staggering disgrace. Yet the<br />\ntenure system is symptomatic of<br />\na larger degeneration. Rote<br />\nlearning has become the<br />\nsurrogate of critical thinking, of<br />\nthe expression of ideas, and the<br />\nmore difficult exercising of the<br />\nstudents' critical faculties. This<br />\nsystem of instruction is easy for<br />\nthe professional researcher to<br />\naccept tacitly, for it requires far<br />\nless expenditure of time on his<br />\nstudents. It bolsters the<br />\nsacrosanct nature of the lab and<br />\nlibrary and reduces the<br />\nrequirements and necessities Of<br />\nproper teaching.<br />\nCONTD.

And, if<br />\nthey do, additional funds will<br />\naccrue to the University. (c) An<br />\n18 months' moratorium on all<br />\nsalary increases a few years ago<br />\nresulted in no noticeable<br />\nperturbations in the annual<br />\nturnover rate. (d) Last, such an<br />\naction would demonstrate that<br />\nwe are a united institution which<br />\ncares enough not to sacrifice its<br />\nmost valuable members.,<br />\nI offer this proposal not as a<br />\nsingle solution but as one of the<br />\nmany options that should be<br />\nfully explored. We don't have<br />\none option, the administrative<br />\nproposal, but many. Likewise,<br />\neach option should be considered<br />\nas a modifiable option. For<br />\nexample, reduce staff over a<br />\nfive-year period including full<br />\nprofessors and administrators.<br />\nOr, don't declare a moratorium<br />\non increases, but establish a<br />\ngraduated salary increase plan to<br />\nhold for two years, and so on.

The recent uproar over<br />\nthe constitutional referendum on<br />\ncampus seems to indicate that<br />\nsome students do not understand<br />\nthis principle.<br />\nOn the other hand, there may<br />\nbe those wno recognize tins<br />\nimplicit principle and disagree ,<br />\nwith it For tilose persohs, I<br />\nsuggest Mat concrete proposals<br />\nfor enfranchising the apathetic<br />\nand alienated students are<br />\npreferable to non-constitutional<br /><br />\nlamentations, complaints, and<br />\naccusations regarding the apathy<br />\nand alienation and their causes<br />\nand consequences. I offer the<br />\nfollowing pair of \"model S.C.<br />\nConstitutional Amendments\" as<br />\nsuch a proposal:<br />\n1) In all S.C. elections, the<br />\nalternative \"None of the above\"<br />\nshall appear on each ballot<br />\nimmediately below the list of<br />\ncandidates for each office. In the<br />\nevent that the number of \"none<br />\nof the above\" votes is the<br />\ngreatest number cast in the<br />\nelection for a particular office,<br />\nnone of the candidates shall be<br />\nelected to that office. The SC<br />\nmay hold another election for<br />\nthe office as soon as possible,<br />\nconsistent with constitutional<br />\nprocedure, but none of the<br />\noriginal candidates may run in<br />\nthe new election, nor in any<br />\nsubsequently-run elections for<br />\nthat office during the academic<br />\nyear. (Note: a more stringent<br />\nproposal would be to have the<br />\noffice vacant until the next<br />\nregularly scheduled election in<br />\nsuch cases. After all, how much<br />\nworse off would the student<br />\nbody really be if it effectively<br />\nabolished a few SC offices for a<br />\nyear by refusing to elect anybody<br />\nto them? I would give this<br />\nversion of the amendment little<br />\nchance of being passed over the<br />\nbowls of protest from the already<br />\nentrenched members of the SC,<br />\nhowever).<br />\n2)In all SC referenda, the<br />\nstudents shall be permitted to<br />\nvote for the alternative \"I don't<br />\ncare.\" For purposes of deciding<br />\nissues, \"I don't care\" votes shall<br />\nnot be counted, HOWEVER, in<br />\nthe case that the number of \"I<br />\ndon't care\" votes is the greatest<br />\nnumber of votes cast in a<br />\nreferendum, all SC officeholders,<br />\nwhether elected or appointed,<br />\nshall be strictly prohibited from<br />\nmaking, or causing to be made,<br />\nany statement to the effect that<br />\nactions taken as a consequence of<br />\nthe outcome of said referendum<br />\nwere taken at the behest of the<br />\nstudent body, or by its mandate,<br />\nor in its,interest. This prohibition<br />\nshall apply to statements made<br />\nverbally or in writing, to the<br />\nstudent body at large or any<br />\nsubset thereof, or -to any<br />\nmember, representative, or<br />\nofficer of any organization<br />\naffiliated with the SC, or to any<br />\nUniversity official, or to any<br />\nrepresentative of the media,<br />\nincluding the campus newspaper<br />\nand radio station. Any violation<br />\nof this prohibition shall be<br />\ngrounds for impeachment and<br />\nremoval from office, and the use<br />\nof such statements in campaign<br />\nliterature or speeches by the<br />\nwinning candidate in any SC<br />\nelection shall be grounds for<br />\ndeclaring that election null and<br />\nvoid.<br />\nThese amendments are offered<br />\nas examples of one approach to<br />\ndealing with apathy and<br />\nalienation on campus.

GRUEN<br /><br />\nDr. Steven Muller has risen in the ranks of<br />\nprofessional academians to achieve what few can:<br />\nthe Presidency of a University. Yet he has also<br />\nobtained experience in many fields on the road to<br />\nhis profession; this story is one that should both<br />\namuse and inspire many of today's youth who are<br />\nwondering how to get along in this world.<br />\nDr. Muller was born in Hamburg, Germany in<br />\n1927. His parents were German, and he lived with<br />\nthem and his brother, who is 14 months younger.<br />\nHis father was Jewish, and a Social Democrat as<br />\nwell, and when the Nazi regime took power in<br />\n1933, as Dr. Muller puts it<br />\nlife got nasty.\"<br />\nHis father was arrested by the Nazis in 1938,<br />\nbut managed to be deported to England. His<br />\nmother, brother and he stayed behind in<br />\nHamburg, while Dr. Muller did everything<br />\npossible to arrange to have his family emigrated<br />\nto England. The Muller family left with very few<br />\nposessions on August 12th, 1939, less than three<br />\nweeks before the start of WW II.<br />\nArriving by airplane from Hambrug to London,<br />\nthe Mullers were reunited and settled down in a<br />\npart of London known as St. Johns Wood. The<br />\ntwo brothers started school in St. Johns Wood,\"<br />\nbut as war had broken out, the whole school was<br />\nevacuated to Chesharn<br />\n. in Buckinghamshire.<br />\n\"We were given gas masks,\" Dr. Muller<br />\nrecalled, \"and the whole school was taken onto<br />\nthe train, and we went to Chesham, where the<br />\ntrain was emptied and we all stood around on the<br />\nvillage green, where different families would<br />\nstand around and claim us. Except nobody<br />\nwanted us, because, although we had good<br />\nschooling in Germany, were obviously fluent in<br />\nGerman, had both had French in school, and I<br />\nknew Greek and Latin, we didn't speak English!<br />\nFortunately, a childless couple named Scull took<br />\nus, so we lived with them, and learned English by<br />\npointing at things. This was fine, except that after<br />\na couple of months, my brother and I were fluent<br />\nin English, but sounded like little Englishmen.\"<br />\nIn April of 1940, the American visa which Mr.<br />\nMuller had applied for four years earlier in<br />\nGermany came through. Although the Mullers<br />\nwere relatively low on the list of applicants, they<br />\nhad the advantage of being in England, whereas<br />\nmost of the families who had wished to emigrate<br />\nwere still in Germany. The Muller family packed<br />\nup an left lby ship for the United States.<br />\nThey settled in New York initially, where they<br />\nlived with an uncle who had left Germany after<br />\nWorld War One. The two brothers had planned to<br />\nstart school in the fall, Dr. Muller explained,<br />\n\"However, my father, you see, had athsma. Now,<br />\n1940 was before air-conditioning, essentially. The<br />\nsummer in New York was bad, and my father<br />\nreally suffered. He didn't have a job, and when he<br />\nwent to the doctor, he was told to go someplace<br />\nlike Arizona or California. Well, we knew where<br />\nArizona was on the map, but that 'meant nothing.<br />\nIn the Los Angeles area, we knew of a number of<br />\nGerman families, no relatives, but Germans who<br />\nhad left Germany nonetheless. So the doctor said .<br />\nthat was fine, that the climate was good there for<br />\nmy father. In the summer of 1940, then, we all<br />\ngot on a Greyhound but -- we didn't go in one fell<br />\nswoop, incidentally, we did make a number of<br />\nstops \u2014 and eight days later we arrived in<br />\nCaliforn ia.\"<br />\nWhen asked what his first impressions were of<br />\nthe United States, Dr. Muller replied, \"We<br />\ncouldn't believe it. It was impressive, but a little<br />\noverwhelming.\" For a person who had never been<br />\noutside Germany or England, that was quite<br />\nunderstandable.<br /><br />\nMr. Muller had some money left, but they had<br />\ncalled, and remember, this is an agent, he now<br />\n\"One day, I was tired, because it was hot we need the part of a midshipman.

He said, 'Oh, I thought ,<br />\n\"I got back from school, and my mother,<br />\nbrothers continued to sell magazines until the<br />\ncalled\u2014brace yourself-- The Hollywood Smarty<br />\nboys read about Captain Horatio HornbloW n\u00b0 had<br />\nbeen Very cool through the whole thing,<br />\nsummer of 1942, when, as related by Dr. Muller,<br />\nParForty.'<br />\nand I said, 'not me.' So he said, 'Well, WC<br />\nveer excited! Mr. Stuart, Tina's agent, had<br />\nthe following happened:<br />\nThe Hollywood Smarty Party, as Dr.<br />\nmaking movie about him with Errol Flynn,<br /><br />\nMuller tells,.\"I was paid ;the princely sum of $25<br />\na week...for answering dumb questions.\"<br />\nThe show had two MCs; the original MC was a<br />\nman by the name of Art Baker. The announcer of<br />\nthe show, whom Dr. Muller met a few times after<br />\nhe became famous, was an obscure radio<br />\nahnouncer named Chet Huntley.<br />\nSteven Muller became a regular on The<br />\nHollywood Smarty Party, and so became fairly<br />\nwellknown at KNX. As Dr. Muller pointed out,<br />\n\"Radio, in those days, was fun. It was live, you<br />\ndidn't need any makeup, and there was no school<br />\non Sundays so I didn't have to worry about<br />\nthat.\" Later those Sunday evenings, CBS had<br />\nanother show known as I Was There. As a<br />\nGerman refugee, Muller was vividly interested in<br />\nthe war, and in history as well, and he hung<br />\naround the set to listen to the programs.<br />\n\"What they did,\" Dr. Muller explained, \"was<br />\nto take real-life people who had had interesting<br />\nexperiences, and at the beginning of the show<br />\nthey would introduce these people. They they<br />\nwould dramatize the interesting experience,<br />\nplayed by CBS actors. One of the program<br />\ndirectors then got the idea that they should do<br />\nthe evacuation of the children from London, and<br />\nthat in addition to introducing my brother and<br />\nme at the beginning of the show, we should play<br />\nourselves, because I was an actor!\"So, Steven and<br />\nNorbert Muller played Steven and Norbert Muller<br />\non this half-hour radio show called I Was There,<br />\nsubject: The evacuation of London.<br />\nNorbert Muller is now a professor of Chemistry<br />\nat Purdue, and, according to Dr. Muller,\" He'd be<br />\nhorrified to learn that I'm telling this story.\"<br />\nSometime in 1944, Mr. Muller lost his job at<br />\nthe candy factory and, for some time, the entire<br />\nMuller family was living off the income from<br />\nSteven Muller's various movie and radio jobs.<br />\ndays came in 1945 when the war finally<br />\nended. Mr. Muller got a new job, and the Mullers<br />\nwere no longer considered enemy aliens. Steven<br />\nMuller went to -U.C.L.A., became associate editor<br />\nof the 'Bruin the student newspaner, and majored in<br />\n]iA al. science.<br />\nDot<br />\n'n MGM movie called Battleground<br />\npart in an<br />\nopened up for a German lieutenant, which Steven<br />\nMuller promptly got. By then lie was 17, and<br />\nrunning for student office; he had a decision to<br />\nmake: should he spend a month or two on<br />\nanother movie, or should he call it quits and<br />\npursue his academic interests?<br />\nThe answer is obvious, but perhaps then it was<br />\nnot quite so easy to decide. Certainly today,<br />\nmany college freshmen would think twice if<br />\nchoosing between another 4 to 7 years of<br />\neducation and a possible movie career. Yet Steven<br />\nMuller decided to quit acting and involve himself<br />\nin his studies, and this decision eventually led to<br />\nthe presidency at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAlong the road to his current position, Dr.<br />\nMuller acted in a number of fine movies, such ;Is<br />\nHow Green Was My Valley, with Roddy<br />\nMcDowell, with whom Dr. Muller still retains a<br />\nfriendship, The White Cliffs of Dover, with Peter<br />\n'Lorre, and The Seventh Cross, with the renowned<br />\nSpencer Tracy. He met and was cast with such<br />\ngreats as Liz Taylor, Margaret O'Brien, Jane<br />\nPowell, and Joan Crawford.<br />\nThe amazing story that unfolded in the<br />\ninterview, one which Hollywood script-writers<br />\nwould be hard -put to top, 'ended abruptly as<br />\nPresident Muller rushed off to a meeting. But it<br />\nwas a story well worth telling.<br /><br />\nAdam L.

Generally,<br />\nthe more Rex raves, the worse tae film. He liked The<br />\nStepford 'Wives, whicti mignt caaritably be called<br />\n\"dreadful,\" and ne labeled The Thy of the Locust \"fifty<br />\nyears ahead of its time.\" Obviously, tile public agreed<br />\nwith nim on that. Everyone shunned The Day of the<br />\nLocust, apparently deciding to wait fifty years before<br />\nseeing it.<br />\nAlthough lie didn't exactly lose ais nead over An<br />\nUnmarried Woman, Mr. Reed ranted enough so titat tile<br />\nmoviegoing public should beware of titis film. It's tile<br />\nstory of a progressive upper-class New York City woman<br />\nand tile various crises (of psyche, identity, and libido)<br />\nmat sae experiences after her husband of sixteen years<br />\nleaves tier for another woman. Jill Clayburgh, in the title<br />\nrole, does an admirable acting job, as does the remainder<br />\nof the cast, which includes Michael Murphy as the<br />\nestranged liusbaad and Alan Bates as tile woman's- new<br />\nlover. The problem is that tney're playing characters<br />\ncreated by Paul Mazursky, who wrote and directed the<br />\nmovie. Mazursky, who gave tile world that insipid<br />\nrip-off of Beatlemania known as tile Monkees, aas<br />\nstrange talent for concocting characters that -are neither<br />\nlikable, loVable, nor even hateful. They're merely<br />\nannoying. When they come out with lines that are<br />\nsupposed to be witty or wise, they sound more like<br />\nobnoxious smart-asses. Take for instance the scene in<br />\nWhich E r ica (Clayburgn) is having lunch, with her three<br />\nfriends, who are also progressive upper-class New York<br />\nCity women. One of Erica's friends divulges that site's<br /><br />\nhaving an affair with a 19-year-old boy. Another of her<br />\nfriends, cigarette hanging from a limp nand, haughtily<br />\nchimes in, \"Yes, she doesn't know whether to adtipt him<br />\nor fuck him.\" The girls ail have a nauglity little chuckle<br />\nover tins wnile the viewer shifts uneasily in ais seat,<br />\nwincing, \"Uti, yeah. Rignt.\" If Mazursky expects the<br />\nviewer to work Up some kind of feeling for tilese people,<br />\n(other than wishing they'd go away),<br />\n\u2022 ne's asking a..<br />\nawful lot; unless of course tile viewer is iiimseif an<br />\nobnoxious smart-ass.<br />\nAs in Mazursky's flume in Love, tile men in An<br />\nUnmarried +Woman, are portrayed as sex-hungry animals<br />\nwho victimize and humiliate tile stalwart stable women. I<br />\ndon't mean to sound like a Puritan, but not every man is<br />\none big walking errogenous zone, not even in New York.<br />\nMazursky, with this unrealistic depiction of men, wants<br />\nthe viewer to sympathize with Erica, tile poor dear wao's<br />\nforever running from the filthy clutches of the aedonistic<br />\nbeasts--that is, until the pressure becomes too much and<br />\nshe gives in. One migat argue that Mazursky intentionally<br />\nhas these men appear lecherous, to serve ;as a contrast with<br />\nSaul Kaplan (Bates), the man with whom Erica eventually<br />\nfinds some semblance of happiness. But Kaplan is just<br />\nslightly less a lecher than the turkeys that have been<br />\nmaking Erica (and the viewer) nauseous throughout Inc<br />\nmovie.<br />\nThe whole sciimeer is only a couple of notches above<br />\nAs tne World Turns. One gets tile feeling that Mazursky<br />\nabsorbs soaps by day and writes ids movies by aigitt.<br />\nRigat about now, the combination of my being a critic<br />\nand tile austerity of this review is making me feel a little<br />\nguilty. So maybe I should say sometning nice about An<br />\nUnmarried Woman. The nicest tiling 1- can say about tile<br /><br />\nfilm, outside of Jill Clayburgii, is the theater I saw it in,<br />\nthe Senator in beautiful downtown GovanS. The building<br />\nitself dates from tile 1940's and still iiouses some of the<br />\ncharm of thiat era. However, he doesn't shell out $3.25<br />\nt o see charming ciaemas. A Moviegoer buys a ticket in<br />\nthe nope of seeing a good movie, whin unfortunately Ali<br />\nUnmarried Woman isn't.<br />\nPerhaps I might nave appreciated and enjoyed Lie<br />\nmovie more if I were recently divorced. For toat matter,<br />\npentads Paul Mazursky might have done a better job ifhe<br />\nwere a recently-divorced woman, which I doubt ae is.<br />\nMaybe ne should make a movie about a silly filmmaker<br />\nwho writes and directs tedious movies about obnoxious<br />\npeople. If familiarity with a subject guarantees success, then Mazursky migat have something there.<br /><br />\nEverything's flunky-Dory in New Novel<br />\nThe City Bidders. By George<br />\nKonrad. 184 pages.<br />\nHarcourt, Brace, Jovanovich. $7.95.<br />\nBy MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nThe narrator of this Hungarian novel, a middle-ag<br />\ned<br />\nCity planner in an unnamed<br />\nEaster European city, relates<br />\nIlls fragmented memories of<br />\nthe Second World War, his<br />\nfamily, and his city. When he describes partisan activities<br />\nduring the War, and the rubble left where a city<br />\nonce<br />\nstood, one is reminded of'two German novelists, Gunter<br />\nGrass and Heinrich Boll, for they also have a great<br />\ninterest<br />\nin what the<br />\nlatter has called \"rubble .literature.\" Although<br />\nthe characters in<br />\nmany a Grass or Boll novel, like<br />\nKonrad's narrator, live in contemporary Europe,<br />\nmemories of a thirty-year-old war have remained forever<br />\nimbedded within their mind.<br /><br />\nCompounded with these memories are others, among<br />\nthem a richly detailed mental picture of his father's death<br />\nand funeral. His father, a private planner, had built the<br />\npower plant wich kept the city alive for sixty years, but<br />\nthe narrator, a city planner, is about to tear down this<br />\npower plant, one of his father's proudest achievements.<br />\nJust as the son has betrayed the architectural<br />\naccomplishments of his father, he has likewise betrayed<br />\nthe ideals of his -own youth, when, as a social activist at<br />\nthe conclusion of the War, he wanted to build a great new<br />\ncity with the rubble of the old. The revolutionaries of his<br />\ngeneration assumed office and became bureaucrats. City<br />\nplanners, full of architectural ideals in the early years of<br />\nsocialism,!gradually lost<br />\nthese ideals, and their<br />\nachievement, their modern city, \"an eastern European<br />\nshowcase of devastation and reconstruction,\" is<br />\nfunctional, ugly.<br /><br />\n\"I wanted to plan a city,\" laments the narrator, \"but<br />\nit<br />\nhad plans for me.\" Having abandoned the achieveme<br />\nnts of<br />\nhis father, as well as nis own ideals, the city planner<br />\naids<br />\nin the construction of a drab, joyless city, full<br />\nof<br />\nmaterialistic inhabitants, living what Konrad describes as<br />\n\"provisional\" lives. This city is not unlike the conformist,<br />\ndispiriting urban nightmare predicted by Jose Ortega Y<br />\nGasset in his The Revolt of the Masses, because Ortega Y<br />\nGasset also speaks of a modern life that \"has become<br />\nscandalously provisional.\"<br />\nThe city planner, of course, feels guilty about the part<br />\nhe played in the construction of such a world, and<br />\nhe<br />\nrealizes, with sadness and cynicism, that the city he<br />\ndesigned has, in a sense, designed him as well.
