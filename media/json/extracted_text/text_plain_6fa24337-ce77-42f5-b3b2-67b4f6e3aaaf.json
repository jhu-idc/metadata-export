With<br />\na population of 130,000 it was.<br />\nthe birthplace of Mrs. Anna<br />\nGloria Rouiller, a young<br />\ngraduate student and instructor<br />\nof Italian.<br />\nPretty and dark-haired<br />\nRouiller has been at Hopkins for<br />\na year and in America for the<br />\npast three. She is married to an<br />\nAmerican she met some five<br />\nyears ago in Italy. They have an<br />\ninfant daughter.<br />\nGrinning broadly, she seemed<br />\npuzzled over the prospect of<br />\ncomparing life in Italy and<br />\nAmerica. \"It's a more active life<br />\nhere,\" she began, adding though<br />\nthat she finds America<br />\ndangerous at times.<br />\n\"There seem to be more<br />\n<br />\ndishonest people here,\" she said.<br />\n\"They steal more. In Italy you<br />\ncan leave your pocketbook in<br />\nthe park overnight and it will be<br />\nthere the next day.<br />\nDishonesty<br />\n\"Also,\" she went on, \"there's<br />\nno fear of downtown in Italian<br />\ncities.\"<br />\nThe political scene in Italy, on<br />\nthe other hand, Rouiller sees as a<br />\ncomplete mess. \"It's terribly<br />\ndisorganized. Everyone is the<br />\nindividualist and couldn't care<br />\nless about a civic sense. They<br />\nmanipulate and fight a lot.<br />\nAmerican government is<br />\ncertainly a lot better organized.\"<br />\nOn life on the whole in Italy,<br />\nshe says,\"We Italians drink well,<br />\nand live well. People often seem<br />\nmore hectic in America.' The<br />\ntraffic problem in Italy, though,<br />\nhas become nerve-wracking too.<br />\n<br />\n\"All those little 500's zip around<br />\nlike mad,\" and she smiles, \"the<br />\nbug is becoming a big status<br />\nsymbol in Italy.\"<br />\nRouiller speaks remarkably<br />\ngood English for so short a time<br />\nin the U.S.A. Her speech darts<br />\nquickly and melodiously, with<br />\nthe perky Italian accent sluiced:<br />\nwith spunky verve, and short,<br />\ncatchy phrases that capsule her<br />\nthoughts in just a few words.<br />\nIn Italy, education is very<br />\nformal according to Rouiller.<br />\nTeachers \"stand on a pedestal\"<br />\nand expect students to accept<br />\ntheir utterances without<br />\nquestion or discussion. There is<br />\nlittle contact between students<br />\nand faculty, and while students<br />\ndon't have to attend classes,<br />\nteachers for their part merely<br />\nappear when they want to.<br />\nRouiller is happy to see<br />\n<br />\nActivities Funding<br />\n<br />\nSAC Studies Benton Plan<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nThe Student Activities<br />\nCommission is currently<br />\nconsidering a proposal by Arts<br />\nand Sciences Dean George<br />\nBenton to incorporate the<br />\nstudent activities budget into the<br />\noverall Arts and Sciences budget.<br />\nFinal SAC vote on the Benton<br />\nplan is expected shortly after the<br />\nThanksgiving recess. Should the<br />\nSAC turn down the plan, the<br />\nUniversity would phase out its<br />\ncontribution to student activities<br />\nover the next two years.<br />\nThe Benton plan would<br />\nestablish no maximum or<br />\nminimum limitations on the<br />\nactivities budget. The student<br />\n\u2022activities fee collected from each<br />\nundergrad (- totalling $40,000)<br />\nwould still be drawn. Larry<br />\nDenton would review budget<br />\nproposals submitted by the<br />\nseveral treasurers of Student<br />\nCouncil activities committees<br />\nand approve an overall student<br />\nactivities budget.<br />\nDenton explained that, under<br />\nthe Benton plan, should a<br />\nbudget in excess of $40,000 be<br />\napproved, the University would<br />\ncontribute the excess.<br />\n\"On the face of it, it appears<br />\nthat Benton wants complete<br />\ncontrol over the student<br />\nactivities budget,\" commented<br />\nSAC Chairman Dick Heddleson.<br />\n``I don't want the<br />\nadministration completely<br />\nabsent from budget<br />\nconsiderations,\" Heddleson<br />\nadded, \"but neither do I want<br />\nthem to have the last say.\"<br />\nNo Middle<br />\n\"The University simply<br />\nrefuses to take a middle of the<br />\nroad path,\" said Denton, \"by<br />\nfunding student activities<br />\nWithout knowing where the<br />\nmoney is going.\"<br />\nThe SAC would propose the<br />\nbudget to Denton for final<br />\napproval: Any other duties of<br />\nthe SAC under this plan have<br />\nnot been explained.<br />\nCurrently, the SAC controls<br />\nthe activities budget (this year of<br />\n$61,000) independent of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity. $40,000 is drawn<br />\nfrom the activities fee paid by<br />\neach undergrad, and $21,000 is<br />\ncontributed by the University<br />\nwith no strings attached.<br />\nBut the University has<br />\n<br />\ndecided to phase out all such<br />\nsupport over the next two years.<br />\nFor the 72-73 school year the<br />\nUniversity will contribute only<br />\n$11,000, and in 73-74 it won't<br />\ncontribute at all.<br />\nThus, without student<br />\nrejection of last month's<br />\nreferendum proposing an<br />\nincrease in the activities fee, the<br />\n'73-'74 SAC budget will entail<br />\napproximately $40,000 if the<br />\nSAC turns down Benton's<br />\nproposal.<br />\nUncommitted<br />\n<br />\nDick Heddleson<br />\n<br />\nAs of now, many activities<br />\nchairmen who will be effected<br />\nby whichever course the SAC<br />\ndecides to take, are<br />\nuncommitted on the Benton,<br />\nplan.

Another committee hidden away in some<br />\nconference room will not do this.

Two of those problems are the<br />\npressure he comes under to keep the public's<br />\ninterest for such an extensive period, and the<br />\npressure to take decisive stands on issues which<br />\nmight alienate certain groups in his broad<br />\ncoalition of support.<br />\nThere is, in addition, a third dilemma \u2014 how<br />\nto maintain a solid lead in the face of<br />\nfragmentation of votes resulting from too many<br />\ncandidates. Even if he manages to overcome<br />\nnumerous opponents in the primaries, there may<br />\nwell be the specters of Humphrey and Kennedy<br />\nwaiting in the background, not having entered<br />\nthe primaries themselves. They are the two who<br />\nMuskie fears most as potential threats; they are<br />\nthe other two great powers in the party.<br />\nSo these are some of the things undoubtedly<br />\ngoing through the minds of the Muskie cohorts at<br />\nthis early stage. This is not to suggest his<br />\ncampaign is faltering. Quite the contrary: he still<br />\nmaintains a commanding lead over his likely<br />\ncompetitors among the various elements of the<br />\nparty. But these are the problems which have<br />\nsurfaced and may prove to be real detriments<br />\nunless dealt with effectively.<br />\nIt is striking to note how many parallels can be<br />\ndrawn between the positions of Muskie now and<br />\nRichard Nixon in 1968. Candidate Nixon entered<br />\nthe race in 1968 as the acknowledged front<br />\nrunner for his party's nomination. His<br />\norganization was superb and his funds plentiful.<br />\nHe sensed that his role was to stick to the middle<br />\nground and offer quiet reason in the midst of the<br />\nturmoil in the nation. Flanked by Rockefeller on<br />\nthe left and Reagan on the right, he warned his<br />\nparty to avoid extremes. Nixon, unlike his two<br />\nintraparty competitors, was at least acceptable<br />\n(albeit unenthusiastically) to all factions. To<br />\nmaintain his strong lead, he refused to debate his<br />\nopponents, lest they gain at his expense. The<br />\ntactics of moderation, having proved successful<br />\nin Miami, were maintained during the Fall<br />\ncampaign. Nixon made public stands on issues<br />\nwith great caution and took great pains not to<br />\nalienate any groups in his \"new coalition.\"<br />\nBy avoiding questions and confrontations with<br />\nHumphrey and Wallace, he came under charges<br />\nof evasiveness during the closing weeks of the<br />\ncampaign. The persuasiveness of the charges was<br />\nevidenced in the dramatic shrinkage of his<br />\nsupport and the unexpected closeness of the final<br />\nvote. That his tactics had backfired towards the<br />\nJoe Cantor is a junior political science major.<br />\n<br />\nend is undeniable. But that he managed to<br />\nemerge victorious is even more undeniable.<br />\nOne has just to listen to Muskie skirting the<br />\nquestions asked him by reporters to appreciate<br />\nhis moderate temperament and centrist position<br />\nin his party to recognize the possibility that his<br />\ncampaign might take on a good degree of the<br />\ntenor of Nixon's three and one-half years ago.<br />\nThat George McGovern and others will accuse<br />\nhim of evading the issues is a sure bet. Muskie's<br />\ngreat lead and his centrist position will likely<br />\nforce his workers to adopt a strategy much like<br />\nNixon's. Whether it will backfire somewhere<br />\nalong the line is the big question. With a<br />\npersonality generally more popular than Nixon's<br />\nand a more fundamental set of democratic<br />\nvalues, Muskie would hope to avoid the pitfalls<br />\nof his likely Republican opponent's previous<br />\ncampaign.<br />\nThe strategy for countering some of the<br />\npotential problems can be pieced together from<br />\nevents that have occurred and from common<br />\nsense. Some elements of the strategy are as<br />\nfollows:<br />\nFirst; to avoid over-exposure in the press,<br />\ndelay the announcement of candidacy until the<br />\nmomentum resulting from it can be sustained<br />\nuntil the convention. Originally slated for<br />\nSeptember, the formal declaration has been<br />\npushed back to January, 1972.<br />\nSecond; use the precious moments of<br />\nnon-candidacy to build a stronger organization<br />\nand to meet with party leaders around the<br />\ncountry in a more low-deyed manner. All of this<br />\nis being done behind the scenes.<br />\nThird; begin an effort to create a deliberate<br />\ngroundswell movement for Muskie. A few weeks<br />\nago, Missouri's Governor (Hearnes) and its two<br />\nSenators (Symington and Eagleton) held a joint<br />\nnews conference to announce their support of<br />\nMuskie. One can expect a long string of<br />\nannouncements(some dramatic, others less so) at<br />\nregular intervals, thus creating a bandwagon<br />\neffect. The more politicians who board the<br />\nbandwagon, the more will follow. The<br />\nmomentum it picks up would tend to discourage<br />\nother candidates from entering the race,<br />\nhopefully ones with as much clout as Humphrey<br />\nand Kennedy.<br />\nFourth; avoid overzealous positions on issues.<br />\nRemain non-committal when possible. When<br />\ncircumstances demand Muskie to speak out<br />\nforthrightly, he will generally take the liberal<br />\nview,as it is in keeping with his political outlook.<br />\nBut the liberalism will be tempered with enough<br />\ncaution and pragmatism to placate his right flank<br />\nas well.

Her mellow,<br />\nmusical voice gave her words a<br />\ndepth of expression that it<br />\nseemed only she could give.<br />\n\"The one word for Josephine<br />\nJacobsen is matchless,\" said<br />\nElliott Coleman, Writing<br />\nSeminars professor, as he<br />\nintroduced her. \"Through her<br />\npoems, stories, and critiques she<br />\nhas achieved the highest honor<br />\nfor an American poet, the<br />\nPoetry chair at the Library of<br />\nCongress,\" he continued.<br />\n\"My selections form a<br />\ncomplete confusion of periods,<br />\nsubjects, and themes,\" Jacobsen<br />\nprefaced her readings. There<br />\nwas, however, a dominant<br />\nmelancholy tone in her views of<br />\nman's struggle with himself and<br />\nhis world which gave her<br />\nPresentation a sense of unity.<br />\n<br />\nOne of her unpublished<br />\npoems, entitled \"On My Island,\"<br />\nconcerned the anonymity of<br />\nmass murder. She was inspired<br />\nby Lt.

In her<br />\npoem she laments that Calley<br />\n\"never thought to say 'Good<br />\nmorning, child'.\"<br />\nThe rather earthy imagery of<br />\nthe first poem she read, \"Let<br />\nEach Man Remember,\"<br />\nexhibited a pessimistic, though<br />\nnot defeatist view of man's daily,<br />\nlife. She saw men arising each<br />\nday with \"courage bred in flesh<br />\n<br />\nthat is sick to the bone...they are<br />\ntoo brave to say it is simpler to<br />\nbe dead.\" \"The Dancer' deals<br />\nwith the ephemeral quality of<br />\nwhat's happening,\" Jacobsen<br />\nsaid as she prepared to read her<br />\npoem which expressed not only<br />\nthe temporality of such art<br />\nforms as dance, but also the very<br />\nmortality of man.<br />\nTwo of her poems were<br />\nexplicitly about communication.<br />\nIn \"Colby\" one part of a man's<br />\nconsciousness speaks to another<br />\npart, a sort of intra-personal<br />\ndialectic.

The Barnstormers have recruited a<br />\nnumber of these last, and their production of Hadrian VII demonstrates it: The<br />\ntitle role, that of Frederick William<br />\nRolfe/Hadrian, showed every sign of being a difficult part; it involved complicated roles-within-roles whichwerethe sine<br />\nqua non of the entire play. Ron Waife,<br />\nwho played Hadrian, had almost singlehandedly to lead the audience through<br />\nthe tangles and changes of Rolfe/<br />\nHadrian's insanity and the subtleties of<br />\nthe staging. The difficulty of the part was<br />\napparent only through retrospection;<br />\nWaife's performance clarified as well as<br />\ncontrolled' the temper of the show. The<br />\nfew scenes in which Rolfe did not appear<br />\n<br />\nseemed to be innately weaker than those<br />\nwhich he carried.<br />\nThe supporting cast in the Barnstormers' production, which ran Friday<br />\nthrough Sunday evenings, was by and<br />\nlarge, more than competent, although<br />\nHadrian, essentially, is a one-man show.<br />\nSloane Ginsberg as Mrs. Crowe and Marti<br />\nNoonan as Agnes were memorable for<br />\ntheir supporting roles. Still, in any production of this play, the impression Hadrian makes is necessarily the impression<br />\nHadrian makes.<br />\nThe first act began. the delineation of<br />\nRolfe's nervous, obsessive religious fervor<br />\nand his make-shift, impoverished style of<br />\nlife. Two auditors hound him for debts<br />\naccumulated during the twenty years he<br />\nspent seeking ordination. Later, in the<br />\ndress of English prelates, they reappear to<br />\noffer him the long-sought priesthood,<br />\nwhich he accepts. As an aide to the English Cardinal, he travels to Rome for the<br />\nimminent papal election. At the end of<br />\n<br />\nthe first act, a fluke of Vatican politicking results in his election to the Holy See;<br />\nhis coronation is attended by shadows of<br />\nhis past and his future; Jeremiah Sant,<br />\n(Steven Buckingham) an old lover and nemesis-to-be, places the papal crown on his<br />\nhead as George Rose, an anomaly for that<br />\ntime and place, looks on.<br />\n\"Any minute now,\" says a Jesuit chieftain of Rolfe's translation to Hadrian,<br />\n\"someone is going to say it is the hand of<br />\nGod.\" The second act is devoted to Hadrian VII's attempt at reform of the<br />\nChurch's worldliness, opposition to his<br />\nplans within and without the'Church, and<br />\nthe eventual triumph of secularism and<br />\nSant the assassin. After Hadrian's death,<br />\nthe action shifts back to London, where<br />\nthe auditor-prelates confiscate Rolfe's novel Hadrian VII, the concretion of his fantasies, along with his other possessions.<br />\nIn Rolfe's novel, the original Hadrian<br />\nVII, not Rolfe but George Arthur Rose,<br />\nan alter ego, ascends to the papacy.<br />\n<br />\nLuke's stage adaptation divides Rose's<br />\ncharacter in two, Rose and Rolfe; Larry<br />\nEisenberg's direction turns Rose into a<br />\nwoman, played competently by Sherri<br />\nFelt. The changewas mystifying, but definitely interesting. Eisenberg apparently was<br />\nafraid that the play's homosexual symbolism would be lost on the Hopkins audience without the blatant contrast.<br />\nEisenberg's directorial innovations provided !Merest, if not definition. The play,<br />\nto steal a phrase,seemed at times \"malevolently gleeful in its wilfull thorniness,\"<br />\nand Eisenberg obscured nearly as often as<br />\nhe elucidated. The stark staging, however,<br />\nadded to the intensity of the generally<br />\nexcellent acting and costuming. Although<br />\nsome of the humor of Luke's script was<br />\nlost or obscured, the essential tragedy and<br />\npathos of Hadrian VII eluded neither the<br />\ncast nor the audience. The performance<br />\nsurpassed amateur expertise, with the<br />\nnotable exception of three gum-chewing<br />\nacolytes.<br />\n<br />\n\fNovember 19, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 12<br />\n<br />\nAlternative to Levering<br />\n<br />\nGreasy food and funny people: it's only art<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThere was no light out yet,<br />\nand in the bitter cold of early<br />\nmorning a young drunk emerged<br />\nfrom the green wooden doors<br />\ncovering the steps leading to the<br />\nbasement.

If that is true, the<br />\nYoungbloods must be<br />\nconsidered the prime examples<br />\nof the folk side of the San<br />\nFrancisco sound.<br />\nOh No<br />\nThat is not to say that they<br />\nare a folk-rock group. Their<br />\nmusic is not to be confused with<br />\nthe electrified, twelve-string folk<br />\nsongs of the Byrds and Dylan a<br />\nfew years back. It is to be<br />\nconfused with the current<br />\ndown-home, easygoing, country<br />\nstyle of the Grateful Dead.<br />\nDespite their west coast<br />\nsound, the Youngbloods are an<br />\neast coast group. The leader is<br />\nJesse Colin Young, a very good<br />\nguitarist who put out a couple of<br />\n<br />\nsolo folk-blues albums. The<br />\nother original members of the<br />\ngroup had folk backgrounds.<br />\nBanana, Joe Bauer and Michael<br />\nKane came from Cambridge,<br />\nwhile Jerry Corbitt came from<br />\nGeorgia. (Corbitt is no longer<br />\nwith the group. \"Grizzly Bear\"<br />\nwent with him.) Their folk<br />\nbackground, combined with an<br />\ninitial desire for crass<br />\ncommercial success in the rock<br />\nworld, allowed them to come<br />\nout with a San Francisco sound.<br />\nThey now live on the west coast,<br />\nthough for years they were<br />\nbased in New York.<br />\nFar Out<br />\nTheir sound is really<br />\nsomething beautiful. Easy<br />\nrhythms dominate, carried along<br />\nby Young's precise bass work.<br />\nGuitars lightly strumming in the<br />\nbackground accent the beat.<br />\nCountry riffs, Banana's jazz<br />\npiano, and Young's voice stand<br />\nout in front. The Youngbloods<br />\nhave the ability to sound at once<br />\nloose yet precise and together so<br />\nessential to a Frisco type group.<br />\nThey can subtly build up a song<br />\nthat starts slow and easy into a<br />\nhard hitting rock song. The<br />\nlistener is carried along, unaware<br />\nof the changes.<br />\nThe Youngbloods are a very<br />\ngood group, perhaps one of the<br />\nbest around. Their concerts are<br />\nrumored to approach the<br />\ntranscendental.

When the<br />\nNews-Letter itself admits, in a<br />\ntelephone conversation with this<br />\nwriter, that the paragraph cited<br />\nwas \"made up\" and a<br />\nfabrication, the credibility of<br />\nYour paper is certainly<br />\ndiminished. Worse, by<br />\ndemonstrating such an<br />\ninsensitivity to the vital problem<br />\nof Soviet Jews, the News-Letter<br />\nhas maligned the good intentions<br />\nof those who seek to secure the<br />\nrights of free speech and liberty<br />\nfor the Jews of the Soviet Union<br />\nWho must suffer government<br />\noppression.<br />\nIt is the responsibility of a<br />\nfree press to exercise a certain<br />\ndegree of self-control, the most<br />\nimportant element of which is<br />\ntruth.

Symposium<br />\nwas marked by an extreme<br />\namount of interest, and the<br />\nSpeakers on the whole were very<br />\ntalkative. However, their<br />\nspeeches were the subject of a<br />\nlarge amount of words, dealing<br />\nWith which was inevitably<br />\ndifficult. In general, the speeches<br />\nwere edible, but an occasional<br />\nPiece of grisel was to be found,<br />\nalong with the usual corny jokes<br />\nand piecemeal footwork. The<br />\nquestioneers were, of course, the<br />\ntypical assortment of bad, good,<br />\nmediocre, and otherwise.<br />\nNumbers of people did attend<br />\nthe symposium, but that, of<br />\nCourse, is no indication. The<br />\nsubject of this year's<br />\nsYmproseum was USUR<br />\nrelationships, which were not<br />\ndiscussed in great detail by some<br />\nof the speakers, but were by<br />\nOthers. The discourse ended<br />\nWhen one of the insipid<br />\nquestions drove an unsuspected<br />\nSpeaker insane and he had to be<br />\nbodily carried off the stage,<br />\nsince the program was, in fact,<br />\nbeing televised.<br />\n<br />\nlimited to 40, although this is<br />\nnot final.

Muskie favored Hughes<br />\nand quietly let it be known<br />\nthrough his staff, not making a<br />\nformal declaration. Hughes lost,<br />\nand it is not easy to determine<br />\nhow Muskie emerged from this<br />\nparty battle. It seems, as of now,<br />\nhowever, that Muskie has<br />\nreassured some of his liberal<br />\nsupporters while (by softening<br />\nhis support of Hughes) he<br />\nmanaged not to greatly alienate<br />\nhis more conservative ones.<br />\nFifth; convince the pros that<br />\nhis popularity in the polls and<br />\namong politicians can be<br />\nconverted into votes. By making<br />\na good showing in the early<br />\n<br />\nprimaries (New Hampshire and<br />\nFlorida) against numerous<br />\nopponents, Muskie can pave his<br />\nway to success in the later, more<br />\nvaluable, primaries. Then,<br />\nbarring the entry of Edward<br />\nKennedy at a late date (unlikely<br />\nunless in a deadlocked<br />\nconvention), Muskie will sail to<br />\nMiami with the nomination<br />\nnearly locked up.<br />\nWhat one sees emerging are<br />\nsome of the fundamental<br />\nqualities of a Muskie-for-President campaign. It will be<br />\ndesigned to suit the candidate's<br />\ntemperament and to maximize<br />\nthe advantages thereof (i.e.\u2014<br />\nsincerity, integrity, etc.). Its<br />\ntone will be one of moderation<br />\n<br />\ntemperance.<br />\nand of<br />\nA<br />\ndeliberate balance will be<br />\nattempted between all the varied<br />\ncomponents of Muskie's<br />\nsupport. Caution will be the<br />\nguide in public utterances and<br />\nprocedural campaign tactics.<br />\nWhether this balance can be held<br />\nfor ten full months, whether<br />\nMuskie can keep his varied<br />\nsupporters and campaign<br />\nworkers content, and indeed<br />\nwhether an acquired tendency of<br />\novercautiousness and evasiveness<br />\nwould impair his ability to<br />\ngovern if elected all remain to be<br />\nseen.

The ever increasing<br />\ncapacity crowd spilled out into<br />\nfire aisles as they waited<br />\npatiently for someone to appear<br />\non stage. Finally around 8:30,<br />\nRy Cooder , along with his<br />\nback-up band stepped out to do<br />\na warm-up set which exhibited<br />\nexcellent musicianship and<br />\namazing versitility. The group<br />\nwent from electric bottleneck<br />\nblues to an old Gospel song and<br />\nthen on to some straight<br />\nacoustical material when Cooder<br />\nreturned to do an<br />\nunaccompanied encore.<br />\nAlthough Cooder's music was<br />\nalmost unlimited in variety, it all<br />\nseemed to have a \"folk-western\"<br />\naccent to it. His music set the<br />\nstage nicely and seemed to bring<br />\nthe audience up in anticipation<br />\nof Arlo's appearance.<br />\nArlo came on through the<br />\nconfusion of many people in the<br />\ncrowd asking, \"Hey wait a<br />\nminute, isn't that him?\" There<br />\nwas a cloud of almost<br />\noverbearing nonchalance. He<br />\nshot the crowd a pacifying nod,<br />\ngrinned, and busied himself with<br />\ngetting things organized. When<br />\nthings finally got going, the band<br />\nstarted in with some<br />\nfolk-western music which<br />\n.seemed to be perfectly<br />\ncomplimented by the<br />\nenthusiastic mood of the<br />\naudience.<br />\nDuring the show Arlo changed<br />\nback and forth between electric<br />\nand acoustical guitar, and then<br />\nfinally went back and sat down<br />\nat the piano a few times.<br />\nPossibly in anticipation that not<br />\nmany people would be familiar<br />\n<br />\nwith his next song, Arlo added a<br />\nlittle comment about it. \"This is<br />\none of our songs that was never<br />\nplayed on the radio, well, except<br />\nmaybe once in Philadelphia, and<br />\nthe Disc Jockey got fired\u2014<br />\nComing into Los Angeles,<br />\nbringing in a couple of keys.\" A<br />\nbit later on, people started<br />\nyelling requests.

It was one of most<br />\nbeautiful scenes I've ever seen.\"<br />\nOverconfidence<br />\nCox blamed his team's<br />\noverconfidence as the primary<br />\nexplanation of Hopkins'<br />\nmiserable first half performance.<br />\n\"When you go in thinking you're<br />\ngoing to win, your reactions are<br />\nslowed, you're not mentally<br />\nalert, you're not anticipating.\"<br />\nThe mental factor also<br />\naccounted for the team's<br />\nfired-up showing in the second<br />\nhalf. \"Our kids wanted to<br />\nimprove and show Dickinson<br />\nthey were a better team.

The<br />\nDevils effectively took away the<br />\nJays' bread-and-butter power<br />\nplay to Robey, which according<br />\nto Cox meant \"it's up to you to<br />\nfind out what they're giving you.<br />\nLuckily, we were able to do<br />\nthis.\"<br />\nThe Jays had fine success<br />\nrunning dives, quick traps, and<br />\noptions; halfback Pat Neary<br />\naveraged .eight yards per carry<br />\nand fullback Jim Ferguson<br />\nseven.<br />\n\"To me it's a sign of a good<br />\nteam when a team is able to<br />\nswitch from a play that has been<br />\ngood to a play or set of plays<br />\nthat move.

That tally made the<br />\nscore 21-20, at which time Cox<br />\nboldly gambled with a two-point<br />\nconversion try.<br />\n\"I had many thoughts about<br />\nit,\" the coach conceded. \"The<br />\nthing that decided it was that<br />\nthe kids had showed such poise<br />\nand determination to win, it<br />\nwould have been sacreligious not<br />\nto have given them a chance to<br />\nwin.\"<br />\nAs things turned out, Nolan<br />\nmade a fine catch of a looping<br />\nThomas pass in the end zone for<br />\nthe points that put Hopkins on<br />\ntop with 3:50 remaining.

Gardner, Chairman<br />\nCommon Cause<br />\nFormer Secretary<br />\nof Health, Education and Welfare<br />\n<br />\nWho said citizen action is futile? Populism in the<br />\nnineteenth century left an indelible mark on the<br />\nnation. Citizen action won the vote for women in<br />\n1920 and brought the abolition of child labor. The<br />\nlabor movement, the civil rights movement, the<br />\npeace movement, the conservation movement \u2014 all<br />\nbegan with concerned citizens. If we had waited for<br />\nthe government or Congress or the parties to initiate<br />\nany of them, we'd still be waiting. Try to think of a<br />\nsignificant movement in our national life that was<br />\ninitiated by the bureaucracy. Or by Congress. Or by<br />\nthe parties.<br />\nFor a while, we lost confidence in our capacity to<br />\nact as citizens, but the citizen is getting back to his<br />\nfeet. And citizen action is taking on a tough minded<br />\nprofessional edge it never had before. Never has our<br />\nsociety needed more desperately the life-giving<br />\nspark of citizen action. We must make our instruments of self-government work. We must halt the<br />\nabuse of the public interest by self-seeking special<br />\ninterests.<br />\nThe special interests buy favor through campaign<br />\ngifts. What flows back is literally scores of billions of<br />\ndollars in tax breaks, in lucrative defense contracts,<br />\nin favored treatment of certain regulated industries,<br />\nin tolerance of monopolistic practices. And the taxpayer foots the bill.<br />\nTo combat such pervasive corruption, we must<br />\nstrike at the two instruments of corruption in public<br />\nlife\u2014money and secrecy.<br />\nTo combat the corrupting power of money, we<br />\nmust control campaign spending and lobbying, and<br />\nrequire full disclosure of conflict of interest on the<br />\npart of public officials.<br />\nTo tear away the veil of secrecy, we must enact<br />\n\"freedom of information\" or \"right to know\" statutes<br />\nwhich require that the public business be done publicly. And that's only a beginning. We can regain<br />\ncommand of our instruments of self-government.<br />\nTo accomplish this, each citizen must become an<br />\nactivist, especially the college student with his<br />\nnewly acquired right to vote. He must make his voice<br />\nheard. Common Cause, a national citizens' lobby,<br />\nwas created to accomplish just that.

Since his<br />\nletter of October 27,<br />\nadministrative personnel claim<br />\nto have initiated action towards<br />\nbetter security coverage.<br />\nComplaints from Hospital<br />\npersonnel spurred News-Letter<br />\nreporters to visit the East<br />\nBaltimore campus once on<br />\nNovember 7th, and then again<br />\non November 17th, after<br />\nsecurity had supposedly been<br />\ntightened.<br />\nOn the first visit, the reporters<br />\nfound Wegener's claims to be<br />\ntrue. They found that they<br />\ncould walk at will throughout<br />\nthe Hospital, as long as they<br />\nstayed away from the emergency<br />\nand operating rooms. They<br />\nroamed the first level and<br />\nbasement of the building for<br />\nover an hour, seeing the<br />\nPinkerton guards only when<br />\nthey wanted to. The second trip,<br />\nproved much the same.<br />\nNo One<br />\nDuring the first visit, reporters<br />\nwanted to talk to some of the<br />\nguards who were stationed<br />\nbehind the interns' residence at<br />\n550 N. Broadway where the<br />\nMedical Institutions' western<br />\nedge touches the surrounding<br />\nBlack community. A stop at the<br />\nguard station and a quick walk<br />\nthrough the area revealed that<br />\nno one was there. There was one<br />\nguard sitting in a darkened<br />\nbooth outside Hampton House;<br />\nthe Nurses' residence. The main<br />\n(he looked about 60) wouldn't<br />\ntalk to the reporters, mumbling<br />\nsomething about \"checking with<br />\nthe boss.\"<br />\nOn the November 17th visit,<br />\nthere were a few guards walking<br />\non the lonely streets of East<br />\nBaltimore. One or two of them<br />\nstood leaning against a wall,<br />\ntheir hands in their pockets to<br />\nkeep warm, and cigarettes<br />\n<br />\nBy RICHARD GURLITZ<br />\nand<br />\nHOWARD WEAVER<br />\nOn Wednesday night, two<br />\nNews-Letter reporters went<br />\ndown to the East Baltimore<br />\ncampus to check out Hospital<br />\nemployees' continuing<br />\ncomplaints of poor security.<br />\nOn the deserted, though well<br />\nlit streets outside the Hospital,<br />\nthe reporters tried to question a<br />\nwoman to get her views on the<br />\nsecurity situation there. As they<br />\nmoved closer, explaining to her<br />\ntheir mission, she quickened her<br />\npace heading towards the<br />\nresidence building parking lot.<br />\nBreaking into a near run, she<br />\npulled her pocketbook in closer<br />\nto her body and fled for the<br />\nsafety of her car.<br />\nA doctor, heading towards the<br />\n550 N. Broadway Street<br />\nresidence hall, did manage to<br />\nmuster up enough courage to<br />\ntalk to the reporters. \"I<br />\nwouldn't allow my wife and kids<br />\nout here alone now,\" he<br />\nmentioned, although it was only<br />\n9 o'clock at night. He also said<br />\nthat there was some kind of<br />\nunwritten law between the<br />\npeople of the neighborhood and<br />\nHospital employees that<br />\nprovided imunity for doctors as<br />\nlong as they were wearing their<br />\n\"whites.\"<br />\nNot Civilizeds,<br />\nThe woman who had run for.<br />\nher car, seeing the reporters<br />\ntalking to the doctor, and he<br />\ngetting away unharmed,<br />\napproached them in her car. She<br />\nopened the window halfway\u2014<br />\nkeeping her hand on the window<br />\ncrank\u2014 and said she was sorry<br />\nfor running away as she had, but<br />\nexplained, \"The security here is<br />\nso bad that it has made me not<br />\ntrust anyone on the streets.\"<br />\nThe woman was Mrs. Hassie<br />\nDixon, a Radiology Lab<br />\ntechnician. \"It's just not<br />\ncivilized,\" she complained.<br />\nSecurity at the East Baltimore<br />\n<br />\ndangling from their lips. They<br />\nalso refused to talk.<br />\nThe reporters then made<br />\nentrance to the Hospital itself,<br />\nwalking through the main<br />\nentrance lobby, before its twelve<br />\nfoot statue of Christ the Savior.<br />\nThey were not questioned as to<br />\ntheir business in the Hospital by<br />\nany one of the Pinkertons<br />\nstanding idly around.<br />\nIn the Hospital cafeteria,<br />\nwhere a few guards and about 20<br />\nHospital employees sat at tables<br />\nbefore a wall of vending<br />\nmachines, the reporters sat down<br />\nat a table with a young<br />\nRegistered Nurse, and asked her<br />\nabout security in the area.<br />\n<br />\nThe reporters, taking this cue,<br />\nnext headed for the basement.<br />\nIn the long, well lit basement<br />\ncorridors, each footstep<br />\nresounded in sharp echoes. When<br />\nnot walking, only a soft whir of<br />\nmachinery filled the otherwise<br />\nsilent halls. Television cameras,<br />\nlocated every 100 feet along the<br />\nwalls, were announced by signs<br />\nreading: \"WARNING: This area<br />\nis under electronic surveillance.\"<br />\nTherapy Room<br />\nThe I.V, Therapy room was<br />\none of the only areas of activity.<br />\nOn the November 7th visit, two<br />\nwomen and a young man were<br />\nfound preparing syringes and<br />\nmedicine for patients who<br />\nneeded intra-venous medication.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the women hinted that<br />\nthere was \"dangerous medicine\"<br />\nin the area, and admitted that<br />\nthere was little they could do if<br />\nthe reporters had confronted<br />\nthem with force. On the<br />\nNovember 17th visit, other<br />\npeople were found in the I.V.<br />\nTherapy room, but they<br />\nharbored the same sentiments on<br />\nHospital security.<br />\n\"The only contact I've had<br />\nwith the security here is when<br />\nthey locked me in the womens<br />\nroom one night,\" said a young<br />\nlady working in I.V. Therapy.<br />\n\"If you have men working<br />\npart-time as security, you're<br />\ngoing to get part-time security,\"<br />\nshe quipped.<br />\n<br />\nHospital Security<br />\n<br />\nPinkerton<br />\n\"I've never had any<br />\nproblems,\" she said,\"but I work<br />\nupstairs on the patient floors. If<br />\nanyone wanted to rape us,<br />\nthey'd have to make an<br />\nappointment; there's too much<br />\nactivity for trouble up there.\"<br />\nShe mentioned that most nurses<br />\nwere afraid to walk around alone<br />\nin the basement of the building.<br />\n\"It's pretty deserted down there,<br />\nand I've heard of things<br />\nhappening to people who work<br />\nin the basement.\"<br />\n<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nand Institution personnel having<br />\nto display their I.D. cards<br />\nthroughout the building.<br />\nAlthough these steps have<br />\nbeen taken, security at the East<br />\nBaltimore campus remains<br />\nunstable, many Hospital<br />\npersonnel contend. \"Last week,<br />\nwe moved a desk out of the<br />\nHospital, and nobody even asked<br />\nus where we were going,\" said<br />\none employee.<br />\n. Investigation<br />\nMuch of the present<br />\ninvestigation of the security<br />\nsystem at the East Baltimore<br />\ncampus was stimulated by Paul<br />\nWegener, a Hopkins grad student<br />\nin Geography and<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering.<br />\nWegener, who worked for<br />\nPinkerton earlier this year,<br />\npointed out the many flaws of<br />\nthe system in a letter to Dr.<br />\nMilton Eisenhower.<br />\nDescribing his duties, Wegener<br />\nsaid, \"I have walked up to one<br />\nperson trying car doors,<br />\nobserved several rats, stray dogs<br />\nand birds, unlocked three gates<br />\n<br />\nwhile a fourth has been missing<br />\nits lock for a month, spent a<br />\ngood deal of time coming to<br />\nknow the guards and the<br />\nPinkerton routine.\"<br />\n\"I have arrived at work at<br />\n11:45, gone to my post, and<br />\nfilled out a daily report of the<br />\npatrols I will not make, notirg<br />\nthat the lock is still missing from<br />\nthe gate,\" he continued.<br />\nOther guards at the East<br />\nBaltimore campus confirm this<br />\nreport. \"Pinkerton presses these<br />\nmen to insurmountable tasks,\"<br />\nstated one guard who wished to<br />\nremain anonymous. \"For $1.85<br />\nan hour, no benefits, and no<br />\ntraining, you can't expect any<br />\nbetter from them,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nAnother guard, also wishing<br />\nhis name withheld, said that he<br />\nhad been told not to speak to<br />\nanyone about his duties, and<br />\nthat since the recent<br />\nNews-Letter article on campus<br />\nsecurity, \"the heat had been on.<br />\nIt got tough last week, but<br />\nalready things have quieted<br />\ndown,\" he said.<br />\n--30\u2014<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nCLEANERS<br />\n<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor Service '<br />\n<br />\nMexican Food - Cocktails<br />\n<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n<br />\nTIJUANA TACOS<br />\n<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n467-2123<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nYork Rd. nr.

With<br />\na population of 130,000 it was.<br />\nthe birthplace of Mrs. Anna<br />\nGloria Rouiller, a young<br />\ngraduate student and instructor<br />\nof Italian.<br />\nPretty and dark-haired<br />\nRouiller has been at Hopkins for<br />\na year and in America for the<br />\npast three. She is married to an<br />\nAmerican she met some five<br />\nyears ago in Italy. They have an<br />\ninfant daughter.<br />\nGrinning broadly, she seemed<br />\npuzzled over the prospect of<br />\ncomparing life in Italy and<br />\nAmerica. \"It's a more active life<br />\nhere,\" she began, adding though<br />\nthat she finds America<br />\ndangerous at times.<br />\n\"There seem to be more<br /><br />\ndishonest people here,\" she said.<br />\n\"They steal more. In Italy you<br />\ncan leave your pocketbook in<br />\nthe park overnight and it will be<br />\nthere the next day.<br />\nDishonesty<br />\n\"Also,\" she went on, \"there's<br />\nno fear of downtown in Italian<br />\ncities.\"<br />\nThe political scene in Italy, on<br />\nthe other hand, Rouiller sees as a<br />\ncomplete mess. \"It's terribly<br />\ndisorganized. Everyone is the<br />\nindividualist and couldn't care<br />\nless about a civic sense. They<br />\nmanipulate and fight a lot.<br />\nAmerican government is<br />\ncertainly a lot better organized.\"<br />\nOn life on the whole in Italy,<br />\nshe says,\"We Italians drink well,<br />\nand live well. People often seem<br />\nmore hectic in America.' The<br />\ntraffic problem in Italy, though,<br />\nhas become nerve-wracking too.<br /><br />\n\"All those little 500's zip around<br />\nlike mad,\" and she smiles, \"the<br />\nbug is becoming a big status<br />\nsymbol in Italy.\"<br />\nRouiller speaks remarkably<br />\ngood English for so short a time<br />\nin the U.S.A. Her speech darts<br />\nquickly and melodiously, with<br />\nthe perky Italian accent sluiced:<br />\nwith spunky verve, and short,<br />\ncatchy phrases that capsule her<br />\nthoughts in just a few words.<br />\nIn Italy, education is very<br />\nformal according to Rouiller.<br />\nTeachers \"stand on a pedestal\"<br />\nand expect students to accept<br />\ntheir utterances without<br />\nquestion or discussion. There is<br />\nlittle contact between students<br />\nand faculty, and while students<br />\ndon't have to attend classes,<br />\nteachers for their part merely<br />\nappear when they want to.<br />\nRouiller is happy to see<br /><br />\nActivities Funding<br /><br />\nSAC Studies Benton Plan<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nThe Student Activities<br />\nCommission is currently<br />\nconsidering a proposal by Arts<br />\nand Sciences Dean George<br />\nBenton to incorporate the<br />\nstudent activities budget into the<br />\noverall Arts and Sciences budget.<br />\nFinal SAC vote on the Benton<br />\nplan is expected shortly after the<br />\nThanksgiving recess. Should the<br />\nSAC turn down the plan, the<br />\nUniversity would phase out its<br />\ncontribution to student activities<br />\nover the next two years.<br />\nThe Benton plan would<br />\nestablish no maximum or<br />\nminimum limitations on the<br />\nactivities budget. The student<br />\n\u2022activities fee collected from each<br />\nundergrad (- totalling $40,000)<br />\nwould still be drawn. Larry<br />\nDenton would review budget<br />\nproposals submitted by the<br />\nseveral treasurers of Student<br />\nCouncil activities committees<br />\nand approve an overall student<br />\nactivities budget.<br />\nDenton explained that, under<br />\nthe Benton plan, should a<br />\nbudget in excess of $40,000 be<br />\napproved, the University would<br />\ncontribute the excess.<br />\n\"On the face of it, it appears<br />\nthat Benton wants complete<br />\ncontrol over the student<br />\nactivities budget,\" commented<br />\nSAC Chairman Dick Heddleson.<br />\n``I don't want the<br />\nadministration completely<br />\nabsent from budget<br />\nconsiderations,\" Heddleson<br />\nadded, \"but neither do I want<br />\nthem to have the last say.\"<br />\nNo Middle<br />\n\"The University simply<br />\nrefuses to take a middle of the<br />\nroad path,\" said Denton, \"by<br />\nfunding student activities<br />\nWithout knowing where the<br />\nmoney is going.\"<br />\nThe SAC would propose the<br />\nbudget to Denton for final<br />\napproval: Any other duties of<br />\nthe SAC under this plan have<br />\nnot been explained.<br />\nCurrently, the SAC controls<br />\nthe activities budget (this year of<br />\n$61,000) independent of the<br /><br />\nUniversity. $40,000 is drawn<br />\nfrom the activities fee paid by<br />\neach undergrad, and $21,000 is<br />\ncontributed by the University<br />\nwith no strings attached.<br />\nBut the University has<br /><br />\ndecided to phase out all such<br />\nsupport over the next two years.<br />\nFor the 72-73 school year the<br />\nUniversity will contribute only<br />\n$11,000, and in 73-74 it won't<br />\ncontribute at all.<br />\nThus, without student<br />\nrejection of last month's<br />\nreferendum proposing an<br />\nincrease in the activities fee, the<br />\n'73-'74 SAC budget will entail<br />\napproximately $40,000 if the<br />\nSAC turns down Benton's<br />\nproposal.<br />\nUncommitted<br /><br />\nDick Heddleson<br /><br />\nAs of now, many activities<br />\nchairmen who will be effected<br />\nby whichever course the SAC<br />\ndecides to take, are<br />\nuncommitted on the Benton,<br />\nplan. But there appears to be a<br />\ngeneral consensus among them<br />\nthat a last say by the University<br />\non budgeting of student<br />\nactivities would be<br />\ndisadvantagious.<br /><br />\nAnna Rouiller<br />\nstudents with long hair and blue<br />\njeans in America.

The Central<br />\nCommittee is the tentative name<br />\nfor the new Homewood<br />\ngovernance body expected to go<br />\ninto effect next fall.<br />\nThe Governance Committee,<br />\nchaired by Chris Ohly, is going<br />\nover the existing Governance<br />\nReport, issued last year page by<br />\npage, making revisions and<br />\nsuggestions which are expected<br /><br />\nto make the new governing body<br />\na powerful central authority.<br />\nChief Executive<br />\nSuggestions were made at a<br />\nmeeting tuesday night to give<br />\nthe Central Committee power at<br />\nleast equal to that of the Dean<br />\nof Arts and Sciences. Under this<br />\nplan, the Dean would be<br />\nconsidered the Chief Executive<br />\nadministering both the broad<br />\nand everyday decisions of the<br />\ngovernance body.<br />\nThe Governance Committee<br />\nmembers indicated a desire to<br />\nkeep the number of members of<br />\nthe Central body to 15.<br />\nUndergrads, grads, non-tenured<br />\nfaculty, and faculty would have<br />\nthree representatives each, with<br />\nthe undergraduates to be elected<br />\nat large.<br />\nIn addition, there would be<br />\ntwo administrators, and one<br /><br />\nshe remembers happily despite<br />\nthe \"sweetly overprotective\"<br />\nimpulses of her guardian family.<br />\nBack in Italy for college, she<br />\nstudied Accounting, soon found<br />\nherself disliking it, but couldn't<br />\nchange her major under the rigid<br />\nuniversity rules.<br />\nNow, however, Rouiller is off<br />\nto a fresh start as one of the<br />\nthree grad students majoring in<br />\nItalian at Hopkins.<br /><br />\npost-doctorate, union, and<br />\nnon-union employee. Chairing<br />\nthe Committee ex-officio would<br />\nbe the University President.<br />\nAll Matters<br />\nThe Central Committee is<br />\nplanned to deal with all.matters<br />\nwithin the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences. The new governing<br />\ngroup would have standing<br />\ncommittees, including the<br />\nAcademic Council. It is planned<br />\nthat the AC contain student<br />\nmembers having a voice in<br />\ncourse input and professor<br />\nevaluation. The Evening School<br />\nis not expected to be included in<br />\nthe proposed governing .body<br />\nbecause it is a separate Division<br />\nof the University. The SC and<br />\nGS0 shall remain independent<br />\nand in their present forms if<br />\nthey desire. Neither will be in<br />\ncontrol of the student members<br />\non the Central Committee.<br /><br />\n\"When the committee was<br />\nformed, we were told to work<br />\nwith Wcke to improve<br />\nservices,\" Henderson explained.<br />\nIn the beginning of the year,<br />\nthe Macke Co. requested a<br />\ncommittee through which<br />\ncomplaints could be channelled.<br />\nDenton therefore set up this<br />\ncommittee to give Macke a<br />\nservice communication.<br />\nOpposed<br />\nHenderson stated, \"Denton<br />\nwanted us to work with Macke<br />\nservices as they are now.<br />\nHowever, most of the committee<br />\nmembers are opposed to the new<br />\nservice, namely the machines.\"<br />\n\"The purpose of the<br />\ncommittee is to improve existing<br />\nconditions. This is what the<br />\nadministration wants us to do.<br />\nHowever, most of the members<br />\nare opposed to this and are<br />\ntrying to change the policy,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n\"We don't want to work to<br />\nimprove the present service, we<br />\nwant to change it,\" he<br />\nconcluded.<br />\nRichard Moll, Director of<br />\nAdministration, a member of the<br />\ncommittee said, \"So far there is<br />\nnot too much to say about the<br />\ncommittee.\" He explained that<br />\nthe committee has only met four<br />\nor five times.<br />\n\u2022At the first meeting it was<br />\ndetermined that there was only<br />\nan abbreviated group, so the<br />\ncommittee was extended to<br />\ninclude a member of the Arts<br />\nand Sciences Council, two<br />\nevening students, and a<br />\nHomewood employee. There are<br />\nalso two undergraduates, two<br />\ngraduate students, \u2022 and three<br />\nadministrators on the<br />\ncommittee.

Or have they?<br />\nIf one attended all of the<br />\neleven presentations, one might<br />\nfind oneself, on a particularly<br />\nlethargic afternoon, drifting off<br />\nto sleep, and, upon waking,<br />\nwondering if the speaker was,<br />\nlet's see, is that Averell Harriman<br />\nor James Gavin. No, wait a<br />\nminute....don't tell me....<br />\nGround rules were established<br />\nearly. Relations with Russia<br />\nshould get better. That became<br />\nsacred.

How about<br />\nthe State Department polish of<br />\nJoseph Sisco? There were ample<br />\nvariations on a single theme to<br />\nsuit almost any taste; Galbraith's<br />\nCambridge aristocratic matter,<br />\nor, if the Harvard professor's<br />\narrogance offended you, the<br />\ndown-home, midwest<br />\npolitical-shout delivery of Mike<br />\nMansfield.<br />\nVariations<br />\nPerhaps the most interesting<br />\npresentations belonged to the<br />\nRussians. Not that they said<br /><br />\nanything fundamentally<br />\ndifferent from the others, but<br />\nthey were the only speakers who<br />\ncould offer a really different<br />\nperspective. Knowing that the<br />\nrespectable looking gentleman in<br />\na conservative suit behind the<br />\nlectern was a communist, and<br />\nproud of it, tended to keep the<br />\naudience awake.<br />\nNot that the Russians said<br />\nanything fundamentally<br />\ndifferent. They too agreed that<br />\nno one should blow up the<br />\nworld, and, once again, that<br />\nrelations between the two<br />\ncountries should improve. But<br />\ntheir viewpoint did cause the<br />\naudience to strain themselves<br />\nmentally somewhat, and perhaps<br />\nto learn something.<br />\nThis year's symposium cannot<br />\nbe termed a failure. The<br />\norganizers presented us with the<br />\nusual array of prestigious<br />\nspeakers, and their presence<br />\nmade otherwise dull fall<br />\nafternoons much more<br />\nentertaining.<br />\nBut the symposium cannot be<br />\ntermed a success, either. The<br />\ntopic chosen for discussion was<br />\ntoo well worn to take the event<br />\nsucceed. The dilemmas of<br />\nU.S.-Russian relations are<br />\nobvious to all involved, and we<br />\nheard those dilemmas<br />\nenumerated time and again.<br />\nLast year's discussion on<br />\nviolence chose a topic that was<br />\nthe lead on the nation's<br /><br />\nnewspapers just months before.<br />\nThis year's topic was<br />\nunfortunately outdated by<br />\nibout ten years. Perhaps the<br />\npresentations would have been<br />\nmore successful if the<br /><br />\nsymposium organizers had<br />\ncontacted the speakers over the<br />\nsummer and asked them to<br />\nchange their talks to the topic of<br />\ncurrent headlines, the United<br />\nStates and China.<br /><br />\nMansfield Speaks<br />\nOn Foreign Policy<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nUnited States via the path of a<br />\nwell-meaning humanitarian<br />\nsee in this process of military<br />\ngenerosity into unwarranted<br />\ncontraction some sort of<br />\npolitical and military<br />\nshameful furling of the flag.<br />\ninvolvements in the inner affairs<br />\nRather, the change is sensible<br />\nof other peoples.\"<br />\nand long overdue.\"<br />\nMistakes<br />\nHe noted of the change in<br />\nThe war in Vietnam was cited<br />\nAmerica's foreign aid programs,<br />\nby Mansfield as an example of<br />\n\"It has the virtue of permitting<br />\nhow heavy global military and<br />\nthe burdens of cost to be shared<br />\ndefense committment have led<br />\nwith other nations.

Administration policy and practice concerning protection certainly seem to<br />\nbe unusual, but in a way hardly conducive to safety.<br />\nOn November 7, two News-Letter reporters, acting on<br />\na call from an ex-Pinkerton guard, walked through the<br />\nHospital and found protection to be almost non-existent.<br />\nContacted last week, University officials claimed that security had been tightened, although those most directly<br />\nconnected with the situation hedged their statements<br />\nabout the effectiveness of the protection. Another look at<br />\nthe Hospital revealed no improvement at all; no one working at the Institutions can be said to be any safer. Bureaucracies are notoriously lethargic, but Hopkins has had decades, not weeks, to work on the problem. Hopkins pays<br />\nPinkerton Guardian between four and five dollars per hour<br />\nfor each of the men the company provides, and those men<br />\nreceive $1.85 per hour, and no meaningful training, from<br />\nthe company.

Another committee hidden away in some<br />\nconference room will not do this.

One of his<br />\nmost salient statements<br />\nconcerned the necessity for<br />\ncloser cooperation between the<br />\ncitizens of the Soviet Union and<br />\nthe United States, through a<br />\nsophisticated understanding of<br />\neach other's culture and life. In<br />\nattributing to Dr. Matveyev<br />\ncertain anti-Semitic remarks,<br />\nwhich he supposedly \"deleted<br />\n(continued on page 15)<br /><br />\nThe Presidency<br /><br />\nFrontrunner<br />\nJoe Cantor<br />\nLast Tuesday in this space, it was argued that<br />\nalthough Ed Muskie remains the front runner for<br />\nthe Democratic nomination next July, there are<br />\ncertain problems inherent in that much<br />\nsought-after rank. Two of those problems are the<br />\npressure he comes under to keep the public's<br />\ninterest for such an extensive period, and the<br />\npressure to take decisive stands on issues which<br />\nmight alienate certain groups in his broad<br />\ncoalition of support.<br />\nThere is, in addition, a third dilemma \u2014 how<br />\nto maintain a solid lead in the face of<br />\nfragmentation of votes resulting from too many<br />\ncandidates. Even if he manages to overcome<br />\nnumerous opponents in the primaries, there may<br />\nwell be the specters of Humphrey and Kennedy<br />\nwaiting in the background, not having entered<br />\nthe primaries themselves. They are the two who<br />\nMuskie fears most as potential threats; they are<br />\nthe other two great powers in the party.<br />\nSo these are some of the things undoubtedly<br />\ngoing through the minds of the Muskie cohorts at<br />\nthis early stage. This is not to suggest his<br />\ncampaign is faltering. Quite the contrary: he still<br />\nmaintains a commanding lead over his likely<br />\ncompetitors among the various elements of the<br />\nparty. But these are the problems which have<br />\nsurfaced and may prove to be real detriments<br />\nunless dealt with effectively.<br />\nIt is striking to note how many parallels can be<br />\ndrawn between the positions of Muskie now and<br />\nRichard Nixon in 1968. Candidate Nixon entered<br />\nthe race in 1968 as the acknowledged front<br />\nrunner for his party's nomination. His<br />\norganization was superb and his funds plentiful.<br />\nHe sensed that his role was to stick to the middle<br />\nground and offer quiet reason in the midst of the<br />\nturmoil in the nation. Flanked by Rockefeller on<br />\nthe left and Reagan on the right, he warned his<br />\nparty to avoid extremes. Nixon, unlike his two<br />\nintraparty competitors, was at least acceptable<br />\n(albeit unenthusiastically) to all factions. To<br />\nmaintain his strong lead, he refused to debate his<br />\nopponents, lest they gain at his expense. The<br />\ntactics of moderation, having proved successful<br />\nin Miami, were maintained during the Fall<br />\ncampaign. Nixon made public stands on issues<br />\nwith great caution and took great pains not to<br />\nalienate any groups in his \"new coalition.\"<br />\nBy avoiding questions and confrontations with<br />\nHumphrey and Wallace, he came under charges<br />\nof evasiveness during the closing weeks of the<br />\ncampaign. The persuasiveness of the charges was<br />\nevidenced in the dramatic shrinkage of his<br />\nsupport and the unexpected closeness of the final<br />\nvote. That his tactics had backfired towards the<br />\nJoe Cantor is a junior political science major.<br /><br />\nend is undeniable. But that he managed to<br />\nemerge victorious is even more undeniable.<br />\nOne has just to listen to Muskie skirting the<br />\nquestions asked him by reporters to appreciate<br />\nhis moderate temperament and centrist position<br />\nin his party to recognize the possibility that his<br />\ncampaign might take on a good degree of the<br />\ntenor of Nixon's three and one-half years ago.<br />\nThat George McGovern and others will accuse<br />\nhim of evading the issues is a sure bet. Muskie's<br />\ngreat lead and his centrist position will likely<br />\nforce his workers to adopt a strategy much like<br />\nNixon's. Whether it will backfire somewhere<br />\nalong the line is the big question. With a<br />\npersonality generally more popular than Nixon's<br />\nand a more fundamental set of democratic<br />\nvalues, Muskie would hope to avoid the pitfalls<br />\nof his likely Republican opponent's previous<br />\ncampaign.<br />\nThe strategy for countering some of the<br />\npotential problems can be pieced together from<br />\nevents that have occurred and from common<br />\nsense. Some elements of the strategy are as<br />\nfollows:<br />\nFirst; to avoid over-exposure in the press,<br />\ndelay the announcement of candidacy until the<br />\nmomentum resulting from it can be sustained<br />\nuntil the convention. Originally slated for<br />\nSeptember, the formal declaration has been<br />\npushed back to January, 1972.<br />\nSecond; use the precious moments of<br />\nnon-candidacy to build a stronger organization<br />\nand to meet with party leaders around the<br />\ncountry in a more low-deyed manner. All of this<br />\nis being done behind the scenes.<br />\nThird; begin an effort to create a deliberate<br />\ngroundswell movement for Muskie. A few weeks<br />\nago, Missouri's Governor (Hearnes) and its two<br />\nSenators (Symington and Eagleton) held a joint<br />\nnews conference to announce their support of<br />\nMuskie. One can expect a long string of<br />\nannouncements(some dramatic, others less so) at<br />\nregular intervals, thus creating a bandwagon<br />\neffect. The more politicians who board the<br />\nbandwagon, the more will follow. The<br />\nmomentum it picks up would tend to discourage<br />\nother candidates from entering the race,<br />\nhopefully ones with as much clout as Humphrey<br />\nand Kennedy.<br />\nFourth; avoid overzealous positions on issues.<br />\nRemain non-committal when possible. When<br />\ncircumstances demand Muskie to speak out<br />\nforthrightly, he will generally take the liberal<br />\nview,as it is in keeping with his political outlook.<br />\nBut the liberalism will be tempered with enough<br />\ncaution and pragmatism to placate his right flank<br />\nas well.

There<br />\nwas, however, a dominant<br />\nmelancholy tone in her views of<br />\nman's struggle with himself and<br />\nhis world which gave her<br />\nPresentation a sense of unity.<br /><br />\nOne of her unpublished<br />\npoems, entitled \"On My Island,\"<br />\nconcerned the anonymity of<br />\nmass murder. She was inspired<br />\nby Lt. William Calley's trial, and<br />\nshe quoted his statement that<br />\n\"no name, sex, age, or anything<br />\nwas given in my instructions,<br />\njust 'kill Communists'.\"<br />\nMass Murder<br />\nThis reminded the poet of a<br />\nCaribbean tradition she had<br />\nobserved on the small island<br />\nwhere she has lived: before<br />\nkilling the rabid mongooses that<br />\nplague the island, the inhabitants<br />\nwould greet the birds. In her<br />\npoem she laments that Calley<br />\n\"never thought to say 'Good<br />\nmorning, child'.\"<br />\nThe rather earthy imagery of<br />\nthe first poem she read, \"Let<br />\nEach Man Remember,\"<br />\nexhibited a pessimistic, though<br />\nnot defeatist view of man's daily,<br />\nlife.

The Barnstormers have recruited a<br />\nnumber of these last, and their production of Hadrian VII demonstrates it: The<br />\ntitle role, that of Frederick William<br />\nRolfe/Hadrian, showed every sign of being a difficult part; it involved complicated roles-within-roles whichwerethe sine<br />\nqua non of the entire play. Ron Waife,<br />\nwho played Hadrian, had almost singlehandedly to lead the audience through<br />\nthe tangles and changes of Rolfe/<br />\nHadrian's insanity and the subtleties of<br />\nthe staging. The difficulty of the part was<br />\napparent only through retrospection;<br />\nWaife's performance clarified as well as<br />\ncontrolled' the temper of the show.

Still, in any production of this play, the impression Hadrian makes is necessarily the impression<br />\nHadrian makes.<br />\nThe first act began. the delineation of<br />\nRolfe's nervous, obsessive religious fervor<br />\nand his make-shift, impoverished style of<br />\nlife. Two auditors hound him for debts<br />\naccumulated during the twenty years he<br />\nspent seeking ordination. Later, in the<br />\ndress of English prelates, they reappear to<br />\noffer him the long-sought priesthood,<br />\nwhich he accepts. As an aide to the English Cardinal, he travels to Rome for the<br />\nimminent papal election. At the end of<br /><br />\nthe first act, a fluke of Vatican politicking results in his election to the Holy See;<br />\nhis coronation is attended by shadows of<br />\nhis past and his future; Jeremiah Sant,<br />\n(Steven Buckingham) an old lover and nemesis-to-be, places the papal crown on his<br />\nhead as George Rose, an anomaly for that<br />\ntime and place, looks on.<br />\n\"Any minute now,\" says a Jesuit chieftain of Rolfe's translation to Hadrian,<br />\n\"someone is going to say it is the hand of<br />\nGod.\" The second act is devoted to Hadrian VII's attempt at reform of the<br />\nChurch's worldliness, opposition to his<br />\nplans within and without the'Church, and<br />\nthe eventual triumph of secularism and<br />\nSant the assassin. After Hadrian's death,<br />\nthe action shifts back to London, where<br />\nthe auditor-prelates confiscate Rolfe's novel Hadrian VII, the concretion of his fantasies, along with his other possessions.<br />\nIn Rolfe's novel, the original Hadrian<br />\nVII, not Rolfe but George Arthur Rose,<br />\nan alter ego, ascends to the papacy.<br /><br />\nLuke's stage adaptation divides Rose's<br />\ncharacter in two, Rose and Rolfe; Larry<br />\nEisenberg's direction turns Rose into a<br />\nwoman, played competently by Sherri<br />\nFelt. The changewas mystifying, but definitely interesting. Eisenberg apparently was<br />\nafraid that the play's homosexual symbolism would be lost on the Hopkins audience without the blatant contrast.<br />\nEisenberg's directorial innovations provided !Merest, if not definition. The play,<br />\nto steal a phrase,seemed at times \"malevolently gleeful in its wilfull thorniness,\"<br />\nand Eisenberg obscured nearly as often as<br />\nhe elucidated. The stark staging, however,<br />\nadded to the intensity of the generally<br />\nexcellent acting and costuming. Although<br />\nsome of the humor of Luke's script was<br />\nlost or obscured, the essential tragedy and<br />\npathos of Hadrian VII eluded neither the<br />\ncast nor the audience. The performance<br />\nsurpassed amateur expertise, with the<br />\nnotable exception of three gum-chewing<br />\nacolytes.<br /><br />\nNovember 19, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 12<br /><br />\nAlternative to Levering<br /><br />\nGreasy food and funny people: it's only art<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThere was no light out yet,<br />\nand in the bitter cold of early<br />\nmorning a young drunk emerged<br />\nfrom the green wooden doors<br />\ncovering the steps leading to the<br />\nbasement.

Jefferson Airplane,<br />\nRolling Stone claimed, had come<br />\nto represent the rock end of the<br />\nspectrum, producing a modified<br />\nrock music. If that is true, the<br />\nYoungbloods must be<br />\nconsidered the prime examples<br />\nof the folk side of the San<br />\nFrancisco sound.<br />\nOh No<br />\nThat is not to say that they<br />\nare a folk-rock group. Their<br />\nmusic is not to be confused with<br />\nthe electrified, twelve-string folk<br />\nsongs of the Byrds and Dylan a<br />\nfew years back. It is to be<br />\nconfused with the current<br />\ndown-home, easygoing, country<br />\nstyle of the Grateful Dead.<br />\nDespite their west coast<br />\nsound, the Youngbloods are an<br />\neast coast group.

The ever increasing<br />\ncapacity crowd spilled out into<br />\nfire aisles as they waited<br />\npatiently for someone to appear<br />\non stage. Finally around 8:30,<br />\nRy Cooder , along with his<br />\nback-up band stepped out to do<br />\na warm-up set which exhibited<br />\nexcellent musicianship and<br />\namazing versitility. The group<br />\nwent from electric bottleneck<br />\nblues to an old Gospel song and<br />\nthen on to some straight<br />\nacoustical material when Cooder<br />\nreturned to do an<br />\nunaccompanied encore.<br />\nAlthough Cooder's music was<br />\nalmost unlimited in variety, it all<br />\nseemed to have a \"folk-western\"<br />\naccent to it. His music set the<br />\nstage nicely and seemed to bring<br />\nthe audience up in anticipation<br />\nof Arlo's appearance.<br />\nArlo came on through the<br />\nconfusion of many people in the<br />\ncrowd asking, \"Hey wait a<br />\nminute, isn't that him?\" There<br />\nwas a cloud of almost<br />\noverbearing nonchalance. He<br />\nshot the crowd a pacifying nod,<br />\ngrinned, and busied himself with<br />\ngetting things organized. When<br />\nthings finally got going, the band<br />\nstarted in with some<br />\nfolk-western music which<br />\n.seemed to be perfectly<br />\ncomplimented by the<br />\nenthusiastic mood of the<br />\naudience.<br />\nDuring the show Arlo changed<br />\nback and forth between electric<br />\nand acoustical guitar, and then<br />\nfinally went back and sat down<br />\nat the piano a few times.<br />\nPossibly in anticipation that not<br />\nmany people would be familiar<br /><br />\nwith his next song, Arlo added a<br />\nlittle comment about it. \"This is<br />\none of our songs that was never<br />\nplayed on the radio, well, except<br />\nmaybe once in Philadelphia, and<br />\nthe Disc Jockey got fired\u2014<br />\nComing into Los Angeles,<br />\nbringing in a couple of keys.\" A<br />\nbit later on, people started<br />\nyelling requests. Arlo stopped<br />\nand said, \"It may not look like it<br />\nbut we know what we're going<br />\nto play. And if we don't do what<br />\nyou came to hear,\" he<br />\nexplained,\"screw you.\"<br />\nOn several occasions Arlo got<br />\ninto one of his one-breath<br />\ndissertations on this or that,<br />\nmainly about one of his songs or<br />\nabout how he came to be<br />\nplaying in Frederick, Md, a<br />\nquestion which had floated<br />\naround in many of the heads in<br />\nthe crowd. It turned out that the<br />\nconcert was done at the<br />\nsuggestion of Arlo's manager<br />\nwho had proposed Arlo quit<br />\npicking just for himself at home,<br />\nand to go on the road for both<br />\nof them.<br />\nTheir music was very<br />\nenjoyable to listen to, especially<br />\n\"Gabriel's Hiway's Mothers<br />\nBallad no. 16 Blues,\" a<br />\ncombination of fine music and<br />\npleasant lyrics and their<br />\nrendition of one of Arlo's<br />\nfather's songs,\"Lay Down Little<br />\nDoggies Lay Down.\"<br />\nTheir music, as Arlo said<br />\nhimself, was mellow and simply<br />\npleasurable to listen<br />\n_ _to. Most of<br />\nthe material was played in a<br />\ncombination Country-WesternFolk style that was very<br />\ntastefully lacking all the Grand<br />\nFunk Railroad-type feedback<br />\nand amplification which so<br />\nmany bands seem to think<br />\nnecessary. A very fine concert<br />\nby a very fine group of<br />\nmusicians.<br /><br />\nNovember 19, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 17<br /><br />\nStormers`Lose The Barn'Evening College Now<br />\nBy LINDA SHARP<br />\nThe Hopkins Barnstormers are<br />\none campus organization that<br />\ndoes not find the SAC fund cut<br />\nits greatest worry. \"Our major<br />\nproblem is that we have a tight,<br />\norganized group with an<br />\noverwhelming interest in drama,<br />\nbut no place to do shows,\"<br />\nexplained vice-president Ron<br />\nWaife.<br />\nThe Barnstormers are in<br />\nconflict with the<br />\nsemi-professional Theatre<br />\nHopkins over the use of the<br />\nBarn.<br />\nAccording to Waife, \"The<br />\nBarn is leased to Theatre<br />\nHopkins.

The Terrors, 4-0 in<br />\nMAC play, must win or tie<br />\ntomorrow in order to capture<br />\ntheir first MAC championship<br />\nsince 1963. A Blue Jay victory<br />\nwould vault Franklin and<br />\nMarshall, 6-1, into the winner's<br />\ncircle.<br />\nHopkins again - carries a 5-3<br />\nmark into its final game, and is<br />\nriding the crest of a three-game<br />\nwin streak by virtue of the Jays'<br />\n.ncredible come-from-behind<br />\n:Humph over Dickinson last<br />\nSaturday at Carlisle. Hopkins fell<br />\nbehind 21-0, took a 22-21 lead<br />\nwith 3:50 remaining, and fell<br />\nbehind again, 28-22, with 57<br />\nseconds to play before winning<br />\nthe thriller on a Jack Thomas<br />\ntouchdown with 14 seconds<br /><br />\nshowing on the clock.<br />\nBlue Jay Coach Dennis Cox<br />\nwas quite naturally ecstatic over<br />\nthe proceedings. Commenting on<br />\nthe scene at Biddle Field<br />\nfollowing the final gun, the<br />\ncoach remarked,\"I've never seen<br />\na happier bunch of people in all<br />\nmy life. It was one of most<br />\nbeautiful scenes I've ever seen.\"<br />\nOverconfidence<br />\nCox blamed his team's<br />\noverconfidence as the primary<br />\nexplanation of Hopkins'<br />\nmiserable first half performance.<br />\n\"When you go in thinking you're<br />\ngoing to win, your reactions are<br />\nslowed, you're not mentally<br />\nalert, you're not anticipating.\"<br />\nThe mental factor also<br />\naccounted for the team's<br />\nfired-up showing in the second<br />\nhalf. \"Our kids wanted to<br />\nimprove and show Dickinson<br />\nthey were a better team. They<br />\nwere embarrassed; they knew<br />\nthey were a better team and<br />\nshowed they were.\"<br />\nCox also had high praise for<br />\nthe offense for adjusting to the<br />\nRed Devil's keying on star<br />\nhalfback Butch Robey. The<br />\nDevils effectively took away the<br />\nJays' bread-and-butter power<br />\nplay to Robey, which according<br />\nto Cox meant \"it's up to you to<br />\nfind out what they're giving you.<br />\nLuckily, we were able to do<br />\nthis.\"<br />\nThe Jays had fine success<br />\nrunning dives, quick traps, and<br />\noptions; halfback Pat Neary<br />\naveraged .eight yards per carry<br />\nand fullback Jim Ferguson<br />\nseven.<br />\n\"To me it's a sign of a good<br />\nteam when a team is able to<br />\nswitch from a play that has been<br />\ngood to a play or set of plays<br />\nthat move. We didn't put<br />\nanything new in, we didn't<br />\nchange our offense, we didn't<br />\nchange our philosophy one bit.<br />\nWe just concentrated on plays<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nthat would work,\" remarked<br />\nCox.<br />\nThird Touchdown<br />\nIn fact, the Blue Jays were<br />\nable to capitalize on Dickinson's<br />\novercompensation for Robey<br />\nand tight end Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nfor a pair of touchdowns.<br />\nFlanker Billy Nolan raced<br />\nunseen through the Devil<br />\nsecondary for Hopkins' second<br />\nscore, and Thomas' fake to<br />\nRobey into the middle of the<br />\nline enabled the signal caller to<br />\nrace into the end zone for<br />\nHopkins' third touchdown while<br />\nthe entire defensive line<br />\nconverged on the senior<br />\nco-captain. That tally made the<br />\nscore 21-20, at which time Cox<br />\nboldly gambled with a two-point<br />\nconversion try.<br />\n\"I had many thoughts about<br />\nit,\" the coach conceded. \"The<br />\nthing that decided it was that<br />\nthe kids had showed such poise<br />\nand determination to win, it<br />\nwould have been sacreligious not<br />\nto have given them a chance to<br />\nwin.\"<br />\nAs things turned out, Nolan<br />\nmade a fine catch of a looping<br />\nThomas pass in the end zone for<br />\nthe points that put Hopkins on<br />\ntop with 3:50 remaining. Nolan<br />\ncaught the ball no more than an<br />\ninch or two inbounds, but the<br />\nofficial right on the scene made<br />\nthe call without any protest<br />\nfrom Dickinson.<br />\nCraig Walter of the Red Devils<br />\nmade an excellent diving grab of<br />\na Jeff Truskey aerial three<br />\nminutes later to put Dickinson<br />\nback in the lead with less than a<br />\nminute to go, but the Jays came<br />\nback to win the contest thanks<br />\nto some heads-up play.<br />\nRobey got his team downfield<br />\nwith a 40-yard pass completion<br />\non a play where Nolan was the<br />\nprimary receiver. Robey was<br />\nsupposed to block a linebacker,<br />\nbut when his man didn't come in<br /><br />\nSPORTS<br /><br />\n044L)<br />\nto rush Thomas, the halfback<br />\nwent into his pattern.<br />\nOn Thomas' nine-yard<br />\ntouchdown scamper for the<br />\ngame-winner, the quarterback<br />\nwas originally looking to hit<br />\nKowalchuk in the end zone.<br />\nWide receiver Grant Shevchik<br />\ncame back from his pattern to<br />\nthrow a fine block that enabled<br />\nThomas to crack the left corner<br />\nof paydirt with fourteen seconds<br />\nremaining in the game.<br />\nFor his oft-brilliant scrambling<br />\nand overall performance Thomas<br />\nwas rewarded with the game ball<br />\nas the game's outstanding player.<br />\nCox noted that this was the first<br />\ntime he had awarded a football,<br />\nin essence, a $25 trophy.<br />\nTops<br />\nJoe Ouslander, coming off an<br />\ninjured ankle, was named the<br />\nbest offensive lineman; safety<br />\nHarry Stringer, with eight<br />\nunassisted tackles and four<br />\nassists, was the top defensive<br />\nback. Co-captain Eric Bergofsky<br />\ncopped honors as the leading<br />\ndefensive lineman.<br />\nCox was happy to report no<br />\nserious injuries for tomorrow's<br />\ncontest. \"We're stronger, that is,<br />\nhealthier, this year than we were<br />\nlast year at this time.\" The<br /><br />\nCoach attributes this in large<br />\nmeasure to his insistence before<br />\nthe season that each player learn<br />\ntwo positions, one offensive and<br />\none defensive.<br />\nA look at tomorrow's<br />\nopposition shows that the<br />\nTerrors boast a very powerful<br />\nbackfield. The offense is headed<br />\nby halfback Joe Brockmeyer,<br />\nwho last year ran over, under,<br />\naround, and through the Blue<br />\nJay defense for 320 yards and<br />\nthree touchdowns.<br />\nComplementing the junior<br />\nstandout are fullback Tom Botts<br />\nand sophomore quarterback<br />\nMike Bricker.

The various team<br />\nowners (Carolina Comets,<br />\nSeekonk Civilians, Wawatosa<br />\nWigwams,and Steubenville Dirty<br />\nSox, to name four) draw up<br />\ntwenty to thirty cards, one for<br />\neach of his team players. Each<br />\n\u00b0layer is given a name, a<br />\nposition, and lifetime batting<br />\naverage. On the same card<br />\nappear the numbers 3 to 18;<br />\nbeside each number is written<br />\nwhat the player, as a batter, will<br />\ndo if that number comes up with<br />\nthe throw of three dice. The hit<br />\nnumbers (singles, doubles, etc.)<br />\nare, needless to say, the most<br />\ndifficult numbers to roll.<br />\nGame Broadcast<br />\nWhile this game is played out,<br />\nthe residents of Willard 303 do a<br />\nplay-by-play broadcast of the<br />\ngame. Their verbal account,<br />\ncomplete with amusing<br /><br />\ncommercials, are recorded for<br />\nposterity and for later statistical<br />\npurposes on cassette tapes. The<br />\nactual live broadcasts are<br />\ntransmitted from speakers that<br />\ncan be heard, some have said, as<br />\nfar away as the library.<br />\nThe two play by play men call<br />\nthemselves \"Boris Brief\" and<br />\n\"Phil Hrup ,\" both of whom are<br />\nsaid to be bald.

In numbers, the 1971 Jays<br />\nhave thrown for seven<br />\ninterceptions and have lost seven<br />\nof nine fumbles. These figures<br />\ncompare to last season's 19 lost<br /><br />\nfumbles and sixteen<br />\ninterceptions.<br />\nHas this improvement been<br />\nfortuitous, Cox was asked? \"No,<br />\nwe've spent a lot of time on ball<br />\ncarrying drills.

As a result, we're turning<br />\nthe ball over less than two times<br />\na game.\"<br />\nCox is generally quite proud<br />\nof his offenses' accomplishments. With one game left, its<br />\ntotal offense figures have already<br />\nsurpassed last year's statistical<br />\nperformance.<br />\nThe key to this improvement<br />\nhas been the personal<br />\nimprovement of sophomore<br />\nquarterback, Jack Thomas, who<br />\nhas upped his completion<br />\npercentage from 40% to 49% on<br />\nthe strength of his accurate<br />\npassing in the last three games.<br />\nJack has connected on 77 out<br />\nof 159 attempts on the season,<br /><br />\nSTAYING UP LATE<br />\nAND HUNGRY?<br />\nHop on over to Harley's<br />\nHARLEY'S 3111 St. Paul<br /><br />\nTwo Great Christmas Specials<br />\nCANNON TL-QL CAMERA<br />\nw/case and 50 mm 1.8 lens $154.90<br />\nNIKKORMAT - fTN w/case<br />\nand 50 mm 2.0 lens $235.00<br />\nCOME SEE US!<br /><br />\nShish Kchah<br />\nand other specials<br /><br />\n= C7_S-1<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\nfi0 0<br /><br />\n301 1 GREFNMOUNT AVENUE<br /><br />\n23 .:\u00a7200<br /><br />\nThe great cycling additive discovered by<br />\nPortugal people is now available in America.<br />\nCosta Do Sol, estate-bottled, imported vintage rose.<br />\nFor a delicious treat after huff-puffing the hills,<br />\nput a bottle or two in your basket.<br />\nThe full quart size should be enough<br />\nto get you nowhere.<br />\nCosta Do Sol.

Gardner, Chairman<br />\nCommon Cause<br />\nFormer Secretary<br />\nof Health, Education and Welfare<br /><br />\nWho said citizen action is futile? Populism in the<br />\nnineteenth century left an indelible mark on the<br />\nnation. Citizen action won the vote for women in<br />\n1920 and brought the abolition of child labor. The<br />\nlabor movement, the civil rights movement, the<br />\npeace movement, the conservation movement \u2014 all<br />\nbegan with concerned citizens. If we had waited for<br />\nthe government or Congress or the parties to initiate<br />\nany of them, we'd still be waiting. Try to think of a<br />\nsignificant movement in our national life that was<br />\ninitiated by the bureaucracy. Or by Congress. Or by<br />\nthe parties.<br />\nFor a while, we lost confidence in our capacity to<br />\nact as citizens, but the citizen is getting back to his<br />\nfeet. And citizen action is taking on a tough minded<br />\nprofessional edge it never had before. Never has our<br />\nsociety needed more desperately the life-giving<br />\nspark of citizen action. We must make our instruments of self-government work. We must halt the<br />\nabuse of the public interest by self-seeking special<br />\ninterests.<br />\nThe special interests buy favor through campaign<br />\ngifts. What flows back is literally scores of billions of<br />\ndollars in tax breaks, in lucrative defense contracts,<br />\nin favored treatment of certain regulated industries,<br />\nin tolerance of monopolistic practices. And the taxpayer foots the bill.<br />\nTo combat such pervasive corruption, we must<br />\nstrike at the two instruments of corruption in public<br />\nlife\u2014money and secrecy.<br />\nTo combat the corrupting power of money, we<br />\nmust control campaign spending and lobbying, and<br />\nrequire full disclosure of conflict of interest on the<br />\npart of public officials.<br />\nTo tear away the veil of secrecy, we must enact<br />\n\"freedom of information\" or \"right to know\" statutes<br />\nwhich require that the public business be done publicly. And that's only a beginning. We can regain<br />\ncommand of our instruments of self-government.<br />\nTo accomplish this, each citizen must become an<br />\nactivist, especially the college student with his<br />\nnewly acquired right to vote. He must make his voice<br />\nheard. Common Cause, a national citizens' lobby,<br />\nwas created to accomplish just that. It hoped to enroll 100,000 members in its first year, and got that<br />\nnumber in 23 weeks!

Since his<br />\nletter of October 27,<br />\nadministrative personnel claim<br />\nto have initiated action towards<br />\nbetter security coverage.<br />\nComplaints from Hospital<br />\npersonnel spurred News-Letter<br />\nreporters to visit the East<br />\nBaltimore campus once on<br />\nNovember 7th, and then again<br />\non November 17th, after<br />\nsecurity had supposedly been<br />\ntightened.<br />\nOn the first visit, the reporters<br />\nfound Wegener's claims to be<br />\ntrue. They found that they<br />\ncould walk at will throughout<br />\nthe Hospital, as long as they<br />\nstayed away from the emergency<br />\nand operating rooms. They<br />\nroamed the first level and<br />\nbasement of the building for<br />\nover an hour, seeing the<br />\nPinkerton guards only when<br />\nthey wanted to. The second trip,<br />\nproved much the same.<br />\nNo One<br />\nDuring the first visit, reporters<br />\nwanted to talk to some of the<br />\nguards who were stationed<br />\nbehind the interns' residence at<br />\n550 N. Broadway where the<br />\nMedical Institutions' western<br />\nedge touches the surrounding<br />\nBlack community. A stop at the<br />\nguard station and a quick walk<br />\nthrough the area revealed that<br />\nno one was there. There was one<br />\nguard sitting in a darkened<br />\nbooth outside Hampton House;<br />\nthe Nurses' residence. The main<br />\n(he looked about 60) wouldn't<br />\ntalk to the reporters, mumbling<br />\nsomething about \"checking with<br />\nthe boss.\"<br />\nOn the November 17th visit,<br />\nthere were a few guards walking<br />\non the lonely streets of East<br />\nBaltimore.

As they<br />\nmoved closer, explaining to her<br />\ntheir mission, she quickened her<br />\npace heading towards the<br />\nresidence building parking lot.<br />\nBreaking into a near run, she<br />\npulled her pocketbook in closer<br />\nto her body and fled for the<br />\nsafety of her car.<br />\nA doctor, heading towards the<br />\n550 N. Broadway Street<br />\nresidence hall, did manage to<br />\nmuster up enough courage to<br />\ntalk to the reporters. \"I<br />\nwouldn't allow my wife and kids<br />\nout here alone now,\" he<br />\nmentioned, although it was only<br />\n9 o'clock at night. He also said<br />\nthat there was some kind of<br />\nunwritten law between the<br />\npeople of the neighborhood and<br />\nHospital employees that<br />\nprovided imunity for doctors as<br />\nlong as they were wearing their<br />\n\"whites.\"<br />\nNot Civilizeds,<br />\nThe woman who had run for.<br />\nher car, seeing the reporters<br />\ntalking to the doctor, and he<br />\ngetting away unharmed,<br />\napproached them in her car. She<br />\nopened the window halfway\u2014<br />\nkeeping her hand on the window<br />\ncrank\u2014 and said she was sorry<br />\nfor running away as she had, but<br />\nexplained, \"The security here is<br />\nso bad that it has made me not<br />\ntrust anyone on the streets.\"<br />\nThe woman was Mrs. Hassie<br />\nDixon, a Radiology Lab<br />\ntechnician. \"It's just not<br />\ncivilized,\" she complained.<br />\nSecurity at the East Baltimore<br /><br />\ndangling from their lips. They<br />\nalso refused to talk.<br />\nThe reporters then made<br />\nentrance to the Hospital itself,<br />\nwalking through the main<br />\nentrance lobby, before its twelve<br />\nfoot statue of Christ the Savior.<br />\nThey were not questioned as to<br />\ntheir business in the Hospital by<br />\nany one of the Pinkertons<br />\nstanding idly around.<br />\nIn the Hospital cafeteria,<br />\nwhere a few guards and about 20<br />\nHospital employees sat at tables<br />\nbefore a wall of vending<br />\nmachines, the reporters sat down<br />\nat a table with a young<br />\nRegistered Nurse, and asked her<br />\nabout security in the area.<br /><br />\nThe reporters, taking this cue,<br />\nnext headed for the basement.<br />\nIn the long, well lit basement<br />\ncorridors, each footstep<br />\nresounded in sharp echoes. When<br />\nnot walking, only a soft whir of<br />\nmachinery filled the otherwise<br />\nsilent halls. Television cameras,<br />\nlocated every 100 feet along the<br />\nwalls, were announced by signs<br />\nreading: \"WARNING: This area<br />\nis under electronic surveillance.\"<br />\nTherapy Room<br />\nThe I.V, Therapy room was<br />\none of the only areas of activity.<br />\nOn the November 7th visit, two<br />\nwomen and a young man were<br />\nfound preparing syringes and<br />\nmedicine for patients who<br />\nneeded intra-venous medication.<br /><br />\nOne of the women hinted that<br />\nthere was \"dangerous medicine\"<br />\nin the area, and admitted that<br />\nthere was little they could do if<br />\nthe reporters had confronted<br />\nthem with force. On the<br />\nNovember 17th visit, other<br />\npeople were found in the I.V.<br />\nTherapy room, but they<br />\nharbored the same sentiments on<br />\nHospital security.<br />\n\"The only contact I've had<br />\nwith the security here is when<br />\nthey locked me in the womens<br />\nroom one night,\" said a young<br />\nlady working in I.V. Therapy.<br />\n\"If you have men working<br />\npart-time as security, you're<br />\ngoing to get part-time security,\"<br />\nshe quipped.<br /><br />\nHospital Security<br /><br />\nPinkerton<br />\n\"I've never had any<br />\nproblems,\" she said,\"but I work<br />\nupstairs on the patient floors. If<br />\nanyone wanted to rape us,<br />\nthey'd have to make an<br />\nappointment; there's too much<br />\nactivity for trouble up there.\"<br />\nShe mentioned that most nurses<br />\nwere afraid to walk around alone<br />\nin the basement of the building.<br />\n\"It's pretty deserted down there,<br />\nand I've heard of things<br />\nhappening to people who work<br />\nin the basement.\"<br /><br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nand Institution personnel having<br />\nto display their I.D. cards<br />\nthroughout the building.<br />\nAlthough these steps have<br />\nbeen taken, security at the East<br />\nBaltimore campus remains<br />\nunstable, many Hospital<br />\npersonnel contend. \"Last week,<br />\nwe moved a desk out of the<br />\nHospital, and nobody even asked<br />\nus where we were going,\" said<br />\none employee.<br />\n.
