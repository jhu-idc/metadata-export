It has<br />\nalways been very difficult to get<br />\nthe announcements of the meetings and plans of the various<br />\nactivities, the calls for class meetings and all matters of general<br />\ninterest before the students for<br />\nwhom they are intended. The bulletin boards are always so crowded<br />\nthat ` notices are overlooked, or,<br />\noftener still, the students pass by<br />\nthe boards without attempting to<br />\nferret out the notice in which they<br />\nare interested.

Except at a few very rare moments, when flashes of real football were shown, the game was dull<br />\nand monotonous, with a great variety of penalties, delays, fumbles,<br />\npunts and incomplete forward passes. A blazing sun made fast,<br />\nsnappy football impossible, while the inability of the Virginia team to<br />\nhold on to the ball, and of the Hopkins men to gain ground consistently, still further slowed up the game. The stage was all set for a<br />\ngreat contest.; a fine crowd packed its way into the stands, the Hopkins rooters were out in full force with their band, and across the way<br />\nthe Virginia supporters made up for lack of numbers by volume of<br />\nsound. They saw Hopkins fight doggedly to throw back the frequently<br />\nsuccessful attacks of the Southerners and hold their opponents for<br />\nfour downs only a few feet from the goal; they saw some pretty running by Rinehart and Zundel, and the completion of a long forward<br />\npass by each side. But, on the whole, the game was not much more<br />\nthan an exhibition of splendid punting by Calkins and Rinehart.<br />\nWith the exception of the first quarter, Virginia's goal line was<br />\nnever seriously in danger. The Black and Blue forwards could do little<br />\nwith their heavier opponents,'while the backs, slow in starting, were<br />\nfrequently thrown for a loss. Throughout the game the Southerners<br />\nwere clearly superior, although they were often unable to gain and<br />\nwere forced to add another to the long string of punts. 'Much of the<br />\neffectiveness of their attack was lost in the numerous penalties they<br />\nincurred and the fumbles they committed, which probably gained more<br />\nground for the Black and Blue team than the plunges of their backs.<br />\nCalkins opened the hostilities<br />\nby kicking off to Zundel, who was<br />\ndowned by Bill Wood after a short<br />\nrun. Virginia then begania niarch<br />\ndown the field, which came to a<br />\nsudden end when Swartzbaugh<br />\nfell on tt. fumble. After two unsuccessful attempts to pierce the Virginia line Calkins kicked. On the<br />\nnext play Rinehart again fumbled<br />\nand Bill Wood recovered, but to<br />\nno avail, for the Southerners held<br />\nfor downs on their own 15-yard<br />\nline. From then on the play seesawed up and down the field, with<br />\nneither team able to do much on<br />\nthe offensive until a fumble placed<br />\nthe Virginians within striking distance of the Hopkins goal. A desperate defense on the part of the<br />\nBlack and Blue held the ball for<br />\nfour downs a few inches from the<br />\nline, but an off-side play made it<br />\nfirst down, and Zundel went over<br />\nfor a touchdown, Hall kicking<br />\ngoal. The rest of the half was a<br />\nsuccession of kicks, with neither<br />\nside making an apparent gain.<br />\n<br />\nVirginia kicked off for the second half; Hopkins could not gain<br />\nand returned the ball. The rest<br />\nof the third quarter was a long<br />\nsuccession of kicks, with one long<br />\ndash by Jones in between. Virginia began to use forward passes,<br />\nbut the fine work of the Hopkins<br />\nbackfield made them useless; only<br />\none was completed, while Calkins<br />\nintercepted another.<br />\nThe last quarter saw the final<br />\nlowering of the hopes of the Johns<br />\nHopkins stands.

Kelly, Professor<br />\nEmeritus of Gynecology in the<br />\nUniversity, at his home, 1406 Eutaw Place. It has been the annual<br />\ncustom of Dr. Kelly for many<br />\nyears to have these\u2022 men in his<br />\nhome at least once a year, and the<br />\nprivilege of intimately meeting<br />\nsuch an international figure is<br />\nalways eagerly received and appreciated.<br />\nAll<br />\n<br />\nAddresses were made by Dr.<br />\nKelly, Dr. Philip Hitti of Syria<br />\nand Mr. Oscar Gacitua of Chile.<br />\nDr. Hitti and Mr. Gacitua are representatives of the Committee on<br />\nFriendly Relations Among Foreign Students, and have had wide<br />\nexperience in their work with foreign students in their club organizations throughout the whole of<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nThose present were unanimously<br />\nof the opinion that such a large<br />\nand influential university as Johns<br />\nHopkins should have a Cosmopolitan Club. Dr. Hitti explained<br />\nthat the basis for such a club was<br />\n(1) the unity of the human race,<br />\nregardless of color, creed and culture; (2) the individuality within<br />\nthis unity, which must be preserved and expressed; and (3) the<br />\ncontributions of each nationality<br />\nbrought into focus for common international good. After a thorough<br />\ndiscussion of the opportunities<br />\nand difficulties of the Club, a committee was appointed to draw up<br />\na constitution, to report for adoption in the near future. The committee appointed was Dr. H. J.<br />\nPelc, Czecho-Slovakia, from the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene; Mr. P. C.<br />\nHsieh, China, from the Graduate<br />\nSchool; Mr. N. Inouye, Japan,<br />\nfrom the Engineering School; Mr.<br />\nC. C. Hansen Peru from the Medical School;<br />\nS. H. Linn, China,<br />\nfrom the Academic Department,<br />\nand Mr. E. Pierce Hayes, General<br />\nSecretary, University Y. M. C. A.<br />\nThe Cosmopolitan Club in other<br />\nlarge cities has become quite a<br />\nmunicipal pride, and the men are<br />\nfrequently entertained by the<br />\nChamber of Commerce, Rotary<br />\nand Kiwanis clubs, these organizations seeing the possible benefits<br />\nfrom international good will, such<br />\nas the Club will aim to create.<br />\nThe next meeting of the Club<br />\nwill be at the Central Y. M. C. A.,<br />\nCathedral and Franklin streets,<br />\nOctober 22, at 6.30 &clock, when<br />\nthe fifty to sixty foreign men and<br />\nwomen at Johns Hopkins will join<br />\nhands around the common dinner<br />\ntable with a few of their American<br />\nfriends.<br />\nok,<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER'S<br />\nMAILBAG<br />\nA Column in Which the Correspondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, But Shoulder the Responsibility.<br />\nAll letters intended for publication<br />\nmust be concise.<br />\nNo attention will be paid to anonymous letters, but names signed as an<br />\nevidenCe of good faith will not be printed<br />\nIf request is made that they be omitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is not to be<br />\ntaken as an indorsement of its views by<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, Which invites the<br />\nfreest discussion of matters of general<br />\ninterest.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of the Mail Bag:<br />\nDear Sir\u2014I have read with<br />\ngreat interest and approval the<br />\neditorial in the October 12 issue<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER Concerning<br />\nstudent elections.

The men<br />\nin the class, before that time, did<br />\nnot know from which men they<br />\nwere going to choose; they had had<br />\nno time to consider candidates;<br />\nthey had very little time to determine for whom to vote. In this<br />\nelection the successful condidate<br />\nwon by a clear majority.<br />\nIn the case of the election of<br />\nvice-president there was a difference. On the first vote, no nominee had a majority. Immediately,<br />\nsome members of the class held<br />\nthat a plurality was all that was<br />\nnecessary. The constitution was<br />\ncalled for, but its location could<br />\nnot be determined. Several methods of solving the difficulty were<br />\nsuggested, but none was accepted.<br />\nThe meeting passed into a disorderly gathering.

Except at a few very rare moments, when flashes of real football were shown, the game was dull<br />\nand monotonous, with a great variety of penalties, delays, fumbles,<br />\npunts and incomplete forward passes. A blazing sun made fast,<br />\nsnappy football impossible, while the inability of the Virginia team to<br />\nhold on to the ball, and of the Hopkins men to gain ground consistently, still further slowed up the game. The stage was all set for a<br />\ngreat contest.; a fine crowd packed its way into the stands, the Hopkins rooters were out in full force with their band, and across the way<br />\nthe Virginia supporters made up for lack of numbers by volume of<br />\nsound. They saw Hopkins fight doggedly to throw back the frequently<br />\nsuccessful attacks of the Southerners and hold their opponents for<br />\nfour downs only a few feet from the goal; they saw some pretty running by Rinehart and Zundel, and the completion of a long forward<br />\npass by each side. But, on the whole, the game was not much more<br />\nthan an exhibition of splendid punting by Calkins and Rinehart.<br />\nWith the exception of the first quarter, Virginia's goal line was<br />\nnever seriously in danger. The Black and Blue forwards could do little<br />\nwith their heavier opponents,'while the backs, slow in starting, were<br />\nfrequently thrown for a loss. Throughout the game the Southerners<br />\nwere clearly superior, although they were often unable to gain and<br />\nwere forced to add another to the long string of punts. 'Much of the<br />\neffectiveness of their attack was lost in the numerous penalties they<br />\nincurred and the fumbles they committed, which probably gained more<br />\nground for the Black and Blue team than the plunges of their backs.<br />\nCalkins opened the hostilities<br />\nby kicking off to Zundel, who was<br />\ndowned by Bill Wood after a short<br />\nrun. Virginia then begania niarch<br />\ndown the field, which came to a<br />\nsudden end when Swartzbaugh<br />\nfell on tt. fumble. After two unsuccessful attempts to pierce the Virginia line Calkins kicked. On the<br />\nnext play Rinehart again fumbled<br />\nand Bill Wood recovered, but to<br />\nno avail, for the Southerners held<br />\nfor downs on their own 15-yard<br />\nline. From then on the play seesawed up and down the field, with<br />\nneither team able to do much on<br />\nthe offensive until a fumble placed<br />\nthe Virginians within striking distance of the Hopkins goal. A desperate defense on the part of the<br />\nBlack and Blue held the ball for<br />\nfour downs a few inches from the<br />\nline, but an off-side play made it<br />\nfirst down, and Zundel went over<br />\nfor a touchdown, Hall kicking<br />\ngoal. The rest of the half was a<br />\nsuccession of kicks, with neither<br />\nside making an apparent gain.<br /><br />\nVirginia kicked off for the second half; Hopkins could not gain<br />\nand returned the ball. The rest<br />\nof the third quarter was a long<br />\nsuccession of kicks, with one long<br />\ndash by Jones in between. Virginia began to use forward passes,<br />\nbut the fine work of the Hopkins<br />\nbackfield made them useless; only<br />\none was completed, while Calkins<br />\nintercepted another.<br />\nThe last quarter saw the final<br />\nlowering of the hopes of the Johns<br />\nHopkins stands. The Southerners<br />\nsuddenly gave up the kicking game<br />\nand began a march down the field.<br />\nA long forward pass for 25 yards<br />\nplaced the ball 10 yards from the<br />\ngoal; in three more downs it had<br />\nbeen shoved over for the final<br />\nscore of the day. From then on<br />\nthe only feature of the game was<br />\nthe completion of a long forward<br />\npass, Calkins to Knecht.<br />\nWith the exception of the fine<br />\ndefensive play of Bill Wood and<br />\nElmer Jones, and the long spirals<br />\n(Continued on page 8)<br /><br />\nAll Who Have Not Already Subscribed Are Urged to Do So<br />\nat Once.<br /><br />\nPay Your<br />\nNews - Letter<br />\nBill<br /><br />\nNOW<br />\nAt<br />\nthe Postoffice<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 19, 1920<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br /><br />\n\u2022titittgleiranb<br /><br />\nlathes<br /><br />\nIFORYOUNG MEN AND MEN WHO STAY YOUNG<br /><br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

Kelly, Professor<br />\nEmeritus of Gynecology in the<br />\nUniversity, at his home, 1406 Eutaw Place. It has been the annual<br />\ncustom of Dr. Kelly for many<br />\nyears to have these\u2022 men in his<br />\nhome at least once a year, and the<br />\nprivilege of intimately meeting<br />\nsuch an international figure is<br />\nalways eagerly received and appreciated.<br />\nAll<br /><br />\nAddresses were made by Dr.<br />\nKelly, Dr. Philip Hitti of Syria<br />\nand Mr. Oscar Gacitua of Chile.<br />\nDr. Hitti and Mr. Gacitua are representatives of the Committee on<br />\nFriendly Relations Among Foreign Students, and have had wide<br />\nexperience in their work with foreign students in their club organizations throughout the whole of<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nThose present were unanimously<br />\nof the opinion that such a large<br />\nand influential university as Johns<br />\nHopkins should have a Cosmopolitan Club. Dr. Hitti explained<br />\nthat the basis for such a club was<br />\n(1) the unity of the human race,<br />\nregardless of color, creed and culture; (2) the individuality within<br />\nthis unity, which must be preserved and expressed; and (3) the<br />\ncontributions of each nationality<br />\nbrought into focus for common international good. After a thorough<br />\ndiscussion of the opportunities<br />\nand difficulties of the Club, a committee was appointed to draw up<br />\na constitution, to report for adoption in the near future. The committee appointed was Dr. H. J.<br />\nPelc, Czecho-Slovakia, from the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene; Mr. P. C.<br />\nHsieh, China, from the Graduate<br />\nSchool; Mr. N. Inouye, Japan,<br />\nfrom the Engineering School; Mr.<br />\nC. C. Hansen Peru from the Medical School;<br />\nS. H. Linn, China,<br />\nfrom the Academic Department,<br />\nand Mr. E. Pierce Hayes, General<br />\nSecretary, University Y. M. C. A.<br />\nThe Cosmopolitan Club in other<br />\nlarge cities has become quite a<br />\nmunicipal pride, and the men are<br />\nfrequently entertained by the<br />\nChamber of Commerce, Rotary<br />\nand Kiwanis clubs, these organizations seeing the possible benefits<br />\nfrom international good will, such<br />\nas the Club will aim to create.<br />\nThe next meeting of the Club<br />\nwill be at the Central Y.

An unhappy<br />\nexample of the present system was<br />\nfurnished by the election of officers<br />\nin the Sophomore Class this year.<br />\nThe class meeting was announced<br />\ntwo days before the election, by<br />\nthe pinning of small sheets of<br />\npaper on the bulletin boards, which<br />\ncontained, among others, these<br />\nwords:\"Election of Officers.\" Two<br />\ndays later the class met in the<br />\nMechanical Engineering Building,<br />\nand, with little premeditation,<br />\nproceeded to elect the officers to<br />\ngovern it this year.<br />\nFirst, the nominations for the<br />\ntwo \"Hullabaloo\" representatives<br />\nwere received, and these men, with<br />\nlittle opposition, were elected by<br />\na standing vote. Next, nominations were held for the Presidency.<br />\nFour. names, I think, were mentioned, and immediately the balloting, if a standing vote can be<br />\ncalled such, was held. The men<br />\nin the class, before that time, did<br />\nnot know from which men they<br />\nwere going to choose; they had had<br />\nno time to consider candidates;<br />\nthey had very little time to determine for whom to vote. In this<br />\nelection the successful condidate<br />\nwon by a clear majority.<br />\nIn the case of the election of<br />\nvice-president there was a difference. On the first vote, no nominee had a majority. Immediately,<br />\nsome members of the class held<br />\nthat a plurality was all that was<br />\nnecessary. The constitution was<br />\ncalled for, but its location could<br />\nnot be determined. Several methods of solving the difficulty were<br />\nsuggested, but none was accepted.<br />\nThe meeting passed into a disorderly gathering. Several members, emulating, I suppose, that<br />\n\"wilful handful of men\" in the<br />\nSenate, attempted to filibuster so<br />\nthat they could elect, by means<br />\nno one knew, their candidates.<br />\nFinally the meeting adjourned un-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nNEW!
