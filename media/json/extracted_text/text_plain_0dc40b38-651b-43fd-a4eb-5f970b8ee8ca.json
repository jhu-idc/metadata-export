The two associations also<br />\nmet unsuccessfully with University officials to attempt to<br />\npersuade the University to<br />\naccept responsibility for the<br />\nfraternities.<br />\nTom Schmith said the University could not take responsibility. \"We have no right to<br />\ndictate to the fraternities,\" he<br />\nsaid.

He also suggested that<br />\nfraternities encourage upperclass brothers to remain in the<br />\nhouse, in order to develop a<br />\nsense of community with the<br />\nneighbors, and to provide some<br />\ncontinuity from year to year.<br />\nAccording to Eberhart. \"We've<br />\nhad excellent cooperation from<br />\nthe presidents of the four<br />\nfraternities, but they still have a<br />\nway to go before they can be<br />\ncalled good neighbors.

The Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop finds itself cited by the health authorities to<br />\nimprove its facilities. Yet although the violations cited<br />\nduring the inspection are accurate, they are mostly minor<br />\nand fail to constitute a serious indictment of the shop's<br />\noperations.<br />\nMost disturbing for many people is probably the<br />\ndiscovery of mice droppings in the storeroom used by the<br />\nGCS. No evidence, however, indicates that rodents have<br />\never actually disturbed the food there. The other charges<br />\nare rather less shocking. Open milk cartons do perhaps lose<br />\ntheir sterility, but then, the second floor Gilman lobby is<br />\nfortunately not a sterile place to be while the GCS is<br />\noperating.<br />\nThe Gilman Coffee Shop stands out in sharp contrast<br />\nto Servoination as a source of nourishment on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. Servomation, to be sure, follows /all the legal<br />\nrequirements for a food vendor. But it also makes patrons<br />\npay for every bit of this consideration, and pockets a<br />\nhandsome profit besides.<br />\nThe Gilman Coffee Shop basically operates on a<br />\nnon-profit basis. Everything it carries is high in quality but<br />\nvery low in price compared to similar goods at Levering or<br />\neven in a supermarket. Even more important is an intangible benefit produced by the Coffee Shop. The daytime<br />\ncafe-type atmosphere 0 a building where students study is<br />\nvaluable and can be found nowhere else around Homewood. In this respect, the Servomation facilities do not<br />\neven come close to comparing. It is true that to overlook<br />\nlittle violations by the GCS sets a double standard, but the<br />\nshop, like a lemonade stand run by 10-year-olds on the<br />\nstreet, deserves such special status.<br />\n<br />\nDissenting Opinion<br />\n<br />\nDoctor Curbs Are No Cure<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nLast week's editorial entitled \"Cutting Costs,\" which<br />\nproposed national health insurance, regulation of doctors' fees,<br />\nand federally funded medical<br />\nschools, was, at best naive in its<br />\noversimplification and, at worst,<br />\ndangerous in its implications.<br />\nPraising the medical profession for its scientific advances,<br />\nBob Riggs quickly turns to<br />\nblame doctors for creating<br />\n\"unprecedented social problems<br />\nwhich have never been resolved<br />\nin a satisfactory manner.\" As if<br />\nthis were an unalienable truth,<br />\nhe procedes to cite an instance<br />\nof a physician charging a fee too<br />\nexhorbitant to be offset by<br />\ninsurance. Riggs states, \"Even<br />\nthough the orthopedist who set<br />\nthe cast was already right in the<br />\nhospital, and worked on the<br />\npatient for less than 10 minutes,<br />\nhe presented her with a bill of<br />\n$250.00.\" This implies that 1)<br />\nthe distance a doctor travels to<br />\nsee his patient should be considered when totalling the bill<br />\nand 2) a doctor should be paid<br />\naccording to the amount of time<br />\nhe works on a patient. The<br />\nfallacy here is obvious. What a<br />\ndoctor offers is quality, not<br />\nquantity. Should a doctor whose<br />\nbeeper drags him five miles from<br />\nthe proverbial golf course to the<br />\nhospital be paid more for his<br />\nefforts than the doctor who is<br />\non call?

It's lost<br />\nits appeal as a footstool since I can't get my feet on top<br />\nof it without banging my knees on the bottom of the<br />\ndesk. My roommates, afraid that some night it will<br />\nspontaneously combust and burn us all in our beds, have<br />\nbeen stealing a few issues at a time to wrap garbage in.<br />\nIt's a difficult (and messy) procedure to extricate them,<br />\nbut I do the best I can.<br />\nOne of the reasons I save them is to gloat over the<br />\narticles I've written (\"Look, Mom, I got my name in the<br />\npaper!\") But there's also the idea that someday, we'll<br />\nlook back at all these moldy newspapers and realize that,<br />\neven as we spoke, the News-Letter was reporting Historical Events. Somebody in the Library must agree with<br />\nme, because they spend a large amount of time and<br />\neffort binding old News-Letters in volumes and hiding<br />\nthem down on C-Level. If you're looking for some<br />\nentertaining reading and/or an excuse for not working,<br />\ncheck out the collected News-Letters from ten years ago.<br />\nYou might have to sell your soul getting the librarian to<br />\nlet you take them out, but they're worth it.<br />\nOne thing I noticed when I was reading through<br />\nthem was that even over the span of ten years, some<br />\nthings don't change. In 1969, the administration appointed a committee to investigate the Bookstore on<br />\ncharages of incompetence, based on the fact that midterms were fast approaching and many students had yet<br />\nto see their texts, WJHU was again rejected in its annual<br />\nappeal to go FM, and 200 freshmen succumbed to what<br />\nthe News-Letter said was ptomaine poisoning after<br />\neating in the dorm cafeteria.<br />\nOn other college campuses, the three years that I<br />\npicked to look at witnessed student uprisings against the<br />\ndraft, increased mobilization in Viet Nam,and outdated<br />\ndrug laws. Civil rights, coeducation and student governance were topical issues. And,on the local scene, those<br />\nwere the days of the Catonsville Nine, riots following<br />\nthe assassination of Martin Luther King, Klan activity--Some of us tend to assume that Hopkins men<br />\n(Hopkins women hadn't been invented yet) represented<br />\nthe quiet branch of the silent majority in those times of<br />\nprotest. Let it not be said, however, that the University<br />\nlacked that \"small- but vocal minority\" of radicals,<br />\nhotheads, rowdies and assorted malefactors so obviously<br />\na part of other schools. They joined together to form the<br />\nHopkins version of the Students for a Democratic<br />\nSociety. and the New University Conference. These two<br />\ngroups demonstrated wholeheartedly but mostly without much effect against military recruitment on campus<br />\nand especially against ROTC. One of their favorite games<br />\nwas \"Guerrilla Theater.\" Several SDS or NUC students<br />\nwould parade out to the ROTC drill field, act out a play<br />\n(whose participants might include \"Draft Board,\" \"Viet<br />\nCong,\" \" Uncle Sam\" and a student dressed as University President Lincoln Gordon) and \"shoot\" each other.<br />\nROTC usually ignored them, although once or twice<br />\nofficers invited the actors out for coffee to discuss<br />\ndifferences.<br />\nBut when the issue was big enotich. Hopkins men<br />\nceded no encouragement to assert their rights. The<br />\nfreshman class, in particular. could always be relied upon<br />\nto rush blindly to the fore. On April 25, 1969, the<br />\nter banner headline read. \"CITY COPS BUST<br />\n<br />\nDORMITORIES.\" In cooperation with Federal agents,<br />\nBaltimore City Police armed with search and seizure<br />\nwarrants nabbed three Hopkins freshmen in the dorms<br />\non narcotics charges.<br />\nBy the time officers had escorted their prisoners to<br />\nan unmarked car, a crowd of 300 students had gathered.<br />\nWhile police called for reinforcements, students surrounded the vehicle. They did not disperse even when<br />\nadditional officers arrived, until a Deputy Chief of Police<br />\nthrew a canister of tear gas into the crowd.<br />\nAfter the arrest, a large group of students went to<br />\nthe President's Mansion, awakened him and demanded<br />\nan explanation of his and the University's role in the<br />\nbust. Gordon explained that since Hopkins had dropped<br />\nits stance in loco parentis, police with warrants could<br />\nsearch and make arrests without University intervention.<br />\nMost students accepted this explanation, but a few<br />\ncamped out on the President's front steps for the night.<br />\nLater he invited them in for coffee.<br />\nNews-Letter reporter Art Levine described his role<br />\nin the bust:<br />\n<br />\nMINONMEMIIIIIMINI<br />\nmunity, were suddenly shouting, together, \"PIGS! PIGS!<br />\nPIGS!\" Here, on this very same placid campus, kids were<br />\nshouting like Yippies in Chicago.<br />\nThe police car in the road was quickly surrounded<br />\ntc<br />\nby chanting kids. Some students then demonstrated the<br />\nusual Hopkins lack of imagination by sitting in the road<br />\nci<br />\nand chanting, \"The whole world is watching\" before the<br />\nSE<br />\ncops even did anything. Furthermore, they were rather<br />\nr\u20ac<br />\nstupidly situated at the side of the car, unable to block<br />\nanything. Nevertheless, aware that basically it was a<br />\nin<br />\nmeaningless act, Ijoined the kids sitting down.<br />\nA<br />\nI was sitting in the middle of all these kids, and my<br />\npride demanded that I start something. Accordingly, I<br />\nstarted singing in my famous golden voice \"We Shall<br />\nOvercome.\" Oddly enough, kids actually started picking<br />\nup on it. As if that weren't enough to make me get up<br />\nright then and there and call my friends back home, I<br />\nstarted making up verses and kids started singing them,<br />\ntoo.<br />\nFive minutes later, a friend whispers to me, \"Why<br />\ndon't we chant 'We all smoke dope?\"Never one to pass<br />\nup a good opportunity, I started chanting it, and soon<br />\neryone was chanting and stomping in unison, \"We all<br />\nsmoke dope! We all smoke dope!\"(The next day when I<br />\nead in the Sun that they quoted the slogan, I said to<br />\nmyself, \"Hey, that's my chant!\")<br />\nWhile I was musing along these lines, my thoughts<br />\nwere rudely punctured by the cop who started dragging<br />\ne away. I went limp and the cop had to drag me off<br />\nut I was perfectly aware that with just one threat, one<br />\nmenacing look from the cop, I would have scampered up<br />\nand run away. The biggest joke of all was that I was<br />\nbeing applauded for my courage by a group of onlookers. I was getting all the benefits of true conviction<br />\nwithout any of the bother.<br />\nAs things turned out, I didn't have the chance to<br />\ntest my courage. The cops did it for me. I saw this cop<br />\nwhipping out this aerosol can, and my mind flashed<br />\ninstantly\u2014MACE! But instead of running away immediately like a normal person, I paused a fraction oh!<br />\nsecond to see what it looked like. Then I ran away<br />\nhurriedly, my hands covering my eyes, and I found<br />\nmyself screaming like a madman. But inwardly, and I'm<br />\nsure others felt this way, I was glad. I was baptized in<br />\nthe revolution.<br />\n<br />\nLack of organization plagued Hopkins students in<br />\ntheir efforts to stage a truly successful demonstration.<br />\nOften they would set up picket lines or blockade doors,<br />\nonly to discover that they were at the wrong building<br />\nor that their quarry had escaped through another exit.<br />\nMany would-be protests ended at the mere threat of<br />\npunishment. In May of 1968, Baltimore City Police<br />\n<br />\nDe<br />\nna<br />\nth<br />\ncal<br />\nCr,<br />\nstt.<br />\na 1<br />\nVi<br />\nint<br />\n<br />\nan<br />\nNzi<br />\ntul<br />\nsh<br />\npri<br />\nde<br />\nOt<br />\nCc<br />\nsid<br />\nun<br />\nth<br />\nthi<br />\n<br />\nstt<br />\nUr<br />\ntic<br />\nfa(<br />\ndi(<br />\nen<br />\n<br />\nI ran over to Royce and Sylvester, and I was happy<br />\nto see an angry crowd milling about. Then Irealized\u2014A<br />\nBUST! All the paranoia, all the fears, all those kids<br />\nflushing pipes down the toilet were right.<br />\nI was hoping that maybe, just maybe, this crowd<br />\nwould explode. No more would we be isolated from<br />\nevents. No more would I have to read only about riots at<br />\nAll these students, victims of<br />\nother colleges.<br />\nisolation, and lack of cointhroating,<br />\no<br />\nhours<br />\nendless<br />\n<br />\nsquelched a pernicious student demonstration which<br />\nwould, if it worked, have allowed the Good Humor Man<br />\nto peddle his wares on campus.<br />\nStudent protestors had more luck against another<br />\nkind of salesman. 40-50 students staged a \"non-obstructive sit-in\" on the steps of Levering to prevent the Dow<br />\nChemical Company representatives from recruiting<br />\nhere. Dow was making napalm, then, and the protestors<br />\ndemanded that a three-man dele tion be allowed to<br />\n<br />\n\f?ere<br />\n<br />\nled<br />\nthe<br />\n9ad<br />\nthe<br />\nher<br />\n9ck<br />\n's a<br />\n<br />\nmy<br />\nv, I<br />\n<br />\npresent the recruiter with a burned and bloodied doll<br />\nwrapped in Saran Wrap, a Dow product. When this<br />\nrequest was refused, 13 students blocked the exit<br />\nto the building. Threatened by police (including Hopkins<br />\nSecurity guards, Baltimore city Police and other, specially rented policemen) they moved from the door and<br />\nset up a picket line.<br />\nThe most organized, persistent, campus-wide<br />\nresistance' at Hopkins was focused against the Viet Nam<br />\nWar and especially the draft. Campus organizations<br />\nincluded the Viet Nam Committee, the Hopkins Peace<br />\nAction Committee, the Draft Resistance Group, RESPONSE, RESISTANCE, CONCERN and the Union for<br />\n<br />\npassed out antiwar leaflets, 700 Hopkins students<br />\ngathered for an afternoon rally in front of Gilman Hall,<br />\nand almost 7000 amassed later for a march downtown.<br />\nLater, 250 protestors attended candlelight services for<br />\nHopkins students who had died in the War.<br />\nOn October 21, 1967, between 100 and 200 Hopkins students traveled to the Capitol to participate<br />\nin a \"March on Washington,\" protesting U.S. involvement in Viet Nam. After a rally on the steps of the<br />\nPentagon, organizers asked students who were afraid of<br />\nbeing arrested to leave. Those who chose to stay would<br />\ntry to keep the Pentagon from opening the next morning.<br />\n<br />\nDemocracy. The News-Letter reported international and<br />\nto<br />\nrelating<br />\nnews<br />\nnational<br />\nthe War, and information on student unrest at other<br />\ncampuses. In 1967 editors Peter Hernik and Richard<br />\nCrafter, along with ex-editor Bruce Drake, joined 250<br />\nstudent body presidents and newspaper editors in signing<br />\na National Students' Association Statement against the<br />\nViet Nam War. The signers swore to refuse induction<br />\ninto the armed forces as long as the War continued.<br />\nSome Hopkins students and faculty members risked<br />\narrest in their antiwar efforts. On April 3, 1968, a<br />\nNational Day of Resistance to the War, 18 students<br />\nturned in their draft cards and another 125 signed<br />\nstatements of complicity. 40 students and one Hopkins<br />\nprofessor were arrested in February 1970 for staging a<br />\ndemonstration and sit-in at the Baltimore Draft Board<br />\nOffice. In 1967,36 Hopkins professors formed a Faculty<br />\nCommittee of Concern \"to say simply that we are on the<br />\nside of our studen.ts and against the Viet Nam War, both<br />\nunequivocally.\" All signed a petition which stated that<br />\nthey stood ready to help Hopkins students in any way<br />\nthey could.<br />\nDuring a nationally -organized War Moratorium Day,<br />\nstudents and faculty members virtually shut down<br />\nUniversity operations, engaging in massive demonstrations. Although the school did not officially close, 90<br />\nfaculty members cancelled classes so that 40 out of 52<br />\ndid not meet. Those professors who held classes faced<br />\nempty classrooms. The Student Council picketed and<br />\n<br />\nElia Katz, a News-Letter reporter participating in<br />\nthe demonstration, described what happened:<br />\n<br />\n;ing<br />\nup<br />\ne, I<br />\nem,<br />\n<br />\nThy<br />\n)ass<br />\n)on<br />\nall<br />\nmI<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nrhts<br />\nring<br />\n<br />\n9ff<br />\n<br />\n911C<br />\n<br />\n' up<br />\nwas<br />\nokion<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n.?op<br />\nfled<br />\nim)<br />\n.fa<br />\nva<br />\nnd<br />\nI'm<br />\nI in<br />\n<br />\n; in<br />\non.<br />\n<br />\nDrs,<br />\n<br />\nling<br />\nxit.<br />\nof<br />\nlice<br />\n<br />\n.ea<br />\n<br />\nWhat formed in the afternoon was a straight line of<br />\ndemonstration with MP's on one side and demonstrators<br />\non the other, with an inch or two between the two<br />\ngroups. The demonstrators sang various rouser songs,<br />\npatriotic songs, civil rights songs, and a couple of hundred people burned their draft cards, each one holding it<br />\nup for the crowd to see and applaud. Some put flowers<br />\nin the soldiers' guns. Some told the soldiers they were<br />\npeople too, and shot, I put down their guns and join us.<br />\nTwo of them did. This is not a rumor. It happened, and<br />\none was arrested immediately by the Marshals while the<br />\nother made it into our crowd. I believe he was arrested<br />\nlate later.<br />\nWe sang The Star Spangled Banner and This Land is<br />\nYour Land to them, and gave them prune juice and<br />\nFritos. I, too, tried desperately to convince some MP's of<br />\ntheir humanity and good nature, but as it got darker and<br />\ntheir rifle butts hammering on our front line became<br />\nmore and more frequent, they began looking more and<br />\nmore like a line of new General Motors cars. After the<br />\ninitial rush, no demonstrators did anything at all to cross<br />\nthe established line of demonstration. What we wanted...all we wanted..,was to be there all night.<br />\nAt midnight, I found myself, along with my friend<br />\nDouglas Wanken (you may know him\u2014he wears a turtleneck sweater, is very thin, a very nice guy)on the front<br />\n<br />\nhv THERE,<br />\n1.157-Fiv<br />\nTli( WAR!

We sat on the ground offering no provocation.<br />\nWhen, after a series of slight insults and minor bruises,<br />\nthe MP's and Marshals decided to advance, I was hit on<br />\nthe shoulder and on the side of the head with a billy<br />\nclub. I was lurched forward and, taking the hint, I ran<br />\nlike hell. Mr. Wanken was not so lucky. Just before I was<br />\nhit I saw an MP bring his rifle straight down on Mr.<br />\nWanken 's head. He was then dragged to the nearest van,<br />\nnot by the collar, but by the hair. He is now sleeping off<br />\na concussion.<br />\nIn nationally organized protests and in small,<br />\nUniversity-oriented demonstrations, Hopkins students<br />\naquitted themselves tolerably, but it was not until the<br />\nspring of 1970 that 'hell' finally broke loose. For two<br />\nweeks, massive student demonstrations and strikes shut<br />\ndown Johns Hopkins. The issues were military recruitment on campus, classified defense research at APL and<br />\nstudent governance.<br />\nOn Thursday, April 16, 75 students and faculty<br />\nmembers staged a half-hour sit-in in front of the<br />\nPresident's house. Denouncing University complicity in<br />\nthe Viet Nam War, their demands included University<br />\ntermination of all APL classified defense contracts. 40<br />\nactivists blocked the entrance to Levering Hall, to<br />\nprotest the presence of a Marine Corps recruiter inside.<br />\nBecause of military recruitment on campus, 200<br />\nstudents and faculty members threatened the next day<br />\nto take over Homewood House, whereupon a Circuit<br />\nCourt judge issued a ten-day restraining order against<br />\nstudent demonstrations. The Hopkins Strike Committee<br />\nhired a prominent Baltimore attorney to represent them<br />\nin further dealings with the University.<br />\nThat afternoon, Jim Claxton, President of Union<br />\nLocal 1231 which represented 450 nonprofessional<br />\nHopkins employees, announced that the Union officially<br />\nsupported the position of the Strike Committee. Over<br />\nthe weekend 50 students camped out in tents in front of<br />\nHomewood House.<br />\nBy Monday the court injunction had been lifted,<br />\nand the SAC had presented President Gordon with a<br />\nresolution demanding an end to military recruitment.<br />\nhowever. Gordon<br />\nrefused<br />\nto<br />\nact on the<br />\nresolution without canvassing students and faculty<br />\nmembers first.<br />\nDemonstrators outside Homewood House called for<br />\na strike on the following Wednesday. One after another,<br />\n, campus organizations registered their approval. The<br />\nNews-Letter was again in the forefront with its editorial:<br />\nThere are now no longer ally alternative \"legitimate\" channels to which the protestors can appeal. For<br />\nthe past two years, all student \"victories\" including the<br />\ncalendar reform issue, the Levering Hall budget controversy and the Freshman gym boycott have been won<br />\nonly when students exerted pressure outside normal<br />\nchannels.<br />\nThe administration's arrogance of power must be<br />\nmet by stern student-faculty action. A general strike can<br />\nbe used to redress our grievances with an audience that<br />\nwon't be able to afford not to listen. We endorse the<br />\nstatement of the Hopkins Strike Committee and urge all<br />\nstudents to boycott classes and participate in strike<br />\nactivities. We also call on the faculty to support their<br />\nstudents by cancelling classes and taking part in the<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe strike took place on Thursday. Class attendance<br />\nwas down by well over 50%, and demonstrators picketed<br />\nthose classes that were held. Some protestors, trying to<br />\nprevent professors from entering University parking lots.<br />\nreported getting struck by their cars.<br />\nThe next day, 10 representatives of the Hopkins<br />\nStrike Committee, including Drs. Pepper and Pfeffer,<br />\nnegotiated an agreement that led to the end of military<br />\nrecruitment at Hopkins and the formation of a summer<br />\ncommittee to draw up a plan for student governance to<br />\nbe implemented in the fall.<br />\nDuring the last week of classes, some students called<br />\nfor \"relief from academic burdens\" (namely, no finals)<br />\nso that they could respond to what they saw as a national crisis--increased mobilization and the deaths at Kent<br />\nState. Since the administration did not grant this request, those students who decided to abandon their<br />\nstudies and join the demonstrations had to weigh a<br />\nserious set of responsibilities before making a choice.<br />\nI always thought I was the first student from my<br />\nhome town to attend Johns Hopkins, but in my research I was surprised to discover that someone had<br />\nindeed come before me.

His vitality of<br />\nform, vision and social commentary<br />\nareevident in his most recent effort,<br />\nThat Obscure Object of Desire. After<br />\neach of his films, Bunuel insists he is<br />\nretiring, yet he continues to come back<br />\nand give his viewers another unique look<br />\nat contemporary society. In That Obscure<br />\nObject, he examines man's inexplicable<br />\npursuit of ideals of desire.<br />\nSince the first image of his first film,<br />\nUn Chien Andalou (1928), in which a<br />\n.Orl's eye is slit with a razor, Bunuel's<br />\nfilms have been concerned with the<br />\nproblem of sight and seeing. In this new<br />\nfilm, the problem is obscured sight.<br />\nMathieu (Fernando Rey), pursues Conchita (Carole Bouquet and Angela<br />\nMolina)throughout the film, yet he can<br />\nnever explain his desire for her. Even<br />\nwhen they seem to have parted for good,<br />\nhe inevitably bumps into her and resumes<br />\nthe pursuit. Conchita represents this<br />\nobject or ideal for which Mathieu lusts.<br />\nHer response runs from frigidity to wild<br />\npassion, yet their relationship is never<br />\nconsummated. Mathieu continually gets<br />\nclose, but Conchita always eludes him.<br />\nBunuel has employed a perplexing<br />\nsurrealistic device to bring the viewer into<br />\nthis chase after Conchita. She becomes<br />\nobscure and elusive to the audience<br />\nbecause Bunuel has two actresses playing<br />\nthe one role. They have similar looks with<br />\nmany visible differences, but the way<br />\nBunuel dresses and exchanges them (in<br />\nthe same scene, one can walk off-camera<br />\nand the other will walk back on) the<br />\nviewer is thrown into confusion as to<br />\nwhich actress is being pursued. We can see<br />\nthrough Mathieu's problem, but Bunuel<br />\ndemands active participation by eliminating dramatic irony while calling on the<br />\nviewer to identify Conchita while Mathieu pursues her.<br />\nThe film consists of flashbacks to the<br />\nstory of Mathieu's pursuit, as told to a<br />\ncaptive audience in a coach on a train<br />\nfrom Seville to Paris. Mathieu's narrative<br />\ncatches up and merges with the narrative<br />\nof the film as the train is approaching<br />\nMadrid. All the passengers in the coach<br />\nare heading for Paris, but they have<br />\ndecided to make a stopover in Madrid.<br />\nBunuel uses the train, which blindly<br />\npursues some destination down the tracks<br />\nonly to continue on to another, as an<br />\nanalogy to Mathieu's chase. He intersperses quick cuts of a train speeding<br />\nalong the tracks to advance his exposition<br />\nof these ideas of motion and pursuit.<br />\nInterestingly, in these cuts, Bunuel uses<br />\ntwo different types of trains to serve the<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nOTHER<br />\nHALF<br />\nOF THE<br />\n<br />\nsame role, in the way he uses two actresses to play the role of Conchita.<br />\nOn the periphery of the film is the<br />\nconstant threat of terrorism. Bombings,<br />\nhijackings and paranoid discussions pervade the film and the psyche of its<br />\ncharacters. Mathieu fears being pursued<br />\nby the terrorists, and Conchita, unknown<br />\nto him, is a member of one of these<br />\ngroups. The terrorists are an adjunct to<br />\nthe theme of the film; they blindly<br />\ncommit acts of violence in pursuit of<br />\nsome obscure, ideal form of society. In a<br />\nvoice over broadcast at the end of the<br />\nfilm, Bunuel makes a mockery of all these<br />\norganizations by listing numerous acronyms that represent groups responsible<br />\nfor the terrorism, without any reference<br />\nto the ideals behind their acts of violence.<br />\nAll the elements of the film are an<br />\nexposition on the basic theme of pursuit<br />\nfor that obscure object of desire.<br />\nBunuel never explains this desire, but<br />\nhe makes poignant comments on the<br />\nsocial malaise that results from it. When<br />\nConchita allows Mathieu to get close, he<br />\nis compelled to touch her, hold her and<br />\nfondle her. Yet she continually withdraws, and when she challenges his lust,<br />\nhe can only turn away, embarrassed.<br />\nThrough Mathieu's unending, yet unexplained pursuit - of Conchita, Bunuel<br />\nconfronts society with its primal physical<br />\nattraction for the opposite sex. The<br />\nviewer becomes frustrated with Mathieu's<br />\nfailure to consummate, confused by the<br />\ndouble identity of Conchita and indicted<br />\nalong with Mathieu for this primal lust<br />\nwhich rules over any ideals of love or<br />\ndevotion. That Obscure Object of Desire<br />\nis one of Bunuel's less complex films<br />\nbecause it doesn't contain wild dream<br />\nsequences, distortions of time and reality<br />\nand other surrealistic effects; perhaps<br />\nbecause of this, his powerfully vital and<br />\ndisturbing social commentary rings loud<br />\nand clear.<br />\n--StepheriBarr<br />\n<br />\nSpeaker Steve Tbalea,<br />\nFaorn WA's Young<br />\nLea6eaship Council<br />\nFaielag<br />\n<br />\na<br />\ninna memoir<br />\n<br />\nTuesday, Feb. 13<br />\nat 7:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 9<br />\n<br />\nOne9<br />\nSbabbat<br />\n<br />\nListening/Viewing<br />\nRoom<br />\n<br />\nKosbea Dining Hall<br />\n50c donation<br />\nrequested<br />\n<br />\n(Oiranen: $3.50)<br />\n<br />\n6:45 p.m.<br />\n<br />\n\f.

The men<br />\n(7-2) won 83-28, while the<br />\nwomen (6-4) breezed to a<br />\nsurprisingly easy 77-48 victory.<br />\nAccording to Hopkins coach<br />\nTim Welsh, \"The men's part was<br />\nexactly what was expected.<br />\nIt was what we anticipated in<br />\nscore. The women's meet was<br />\nunexpected. We expected a<br />\nmuch closer meet, but the<br />\nwomen swam particularly well.\"<br />\nThe victories were particularly<br />\nimportant because of the order<br />\nof events. As Welsh put it, \"It<br />\nallowed us to qualify for events<br />\nwe hadn't swum yet.\"<br />\nIndeed, the men qualified in<br />\nsix more events and now have at<br />\nleast one entry in each of the<br />\nsixteen Division III Nationals<br />\ncategories. The women qualified<br />\ntheir first two swimmers for the<br />\nAIAW meet (Jackie Johnson in<br />\ntwo events and Monika Bay in<br />\none). In addition, several pool<br />\nrecords were broken.<br />\nIn the first event, the 1650<br />\nyard freestyle for Men, Tim<br />\nCollins and Malcolm McGinnis<br />\nqualified for Nationals while<br />\nfinishing first and second to put<br />\nthe Blue Jays ahead to stay, 8-1.<br />\nThe women qualified their first<br />\nswimmer, Jackie Johnson, in the<br />\n100 yd. freestyle. Later, Johnson qualified for the 50 yd.<br />\nfreestyle. Monika Bay qualified<br />\nin the 200 yd. freestyle.<br />\nJohnson had never swum<br />\ncompetitively before her freshman year at Hopkins (she is<br />\nnow a junior). \"I always wanted<br />\nto swim, but never had the<br />\nmotivation,\" she explained. \"I<br />\nswam here because Hopkins was<br />\na small school and I didn't have<br />\nto try out.\" Once timid, Johnson's confidence has grown<br />\nsteadily over the past two years,<br />\nto the point where she now<br />\nsays, \"I expect to win the 50<br />\nand 100 yd. freestyles at the<br />\nMAC's (the Middle Atlantic<br />\nChampionships).<br />\nConference<br />\n<br />\nprevious JHU pool record, the The MAC's will be held at<br />\nthrough<br />\n200 yd. breaststroke and the Hopkins Thursday<br />\n400 yd. freestyle relay (along Saturday, February 22-24.<br />\nAnother of the swim team's<br />\nwith teammates Steve Fish,<br />\nFrancis Florez and Bill Bender). great success stories is Bill<br />\nHe had already qualified for the Smiddy.

I<br />\ntends to surface. If the team was<br />\nwinning, most of these complaints would never be registered.\"<br />\nWith respect to the threats<br />\nof transfer and quitting, Scott<br />\nadded, \"Some players always<br />\nthreaten to leave when they are<br />\nunhappy with the season's progression. It happens everywhere.<br />\nI am fully behind all our teams<br />\nand coaches here. They do a<br />\nfine job. Basketball is an especially difficult sport to coach.\"<br />\nWhile Mr. Scott seemed to<br />\nimply that the problems have<br />\narisen due to the losing season,<br />\n'the players who spoke are<br />\n,adamant in their assertion that<br />\nthe losing season has developed<br />\nbecause of the problems.<br />\nThese players further claim-ed that Coach Amen does not<br />\nalways play the best players.<br />\nSome of them even stated that<br />\nAmen has showed a bias toward<br />\nhis recruited freshman ball players, especially those from his<br />\nhome area of Long Island.<br />\nIt was asserted that on many<br />\noccasions, the coach would put<br />\nin his \"favorite\" players instead<br />\nof those who had more demonstrated ability.\" the coach<br />\nreplied. \"Whether they come<br />\nfrom New York, Pennsylvania,<br />\nMaryland or California, the<br />\nplayers on the court are the ones<br />\nwhich I believe to be the best for<br />\nthe given situation.\"<br />\nAnother claim made by a<br />\ncouple of players was that Coach<br />\nAmen gives free reign on the<br />\ncourt to some team members<br />\nwhile he, in a sense, handcuffs<br />\nothers from shooting. One player felt that if he were given the<br />\nfreedom to shoot more he would<br />\nbe able to help the team win.<br />\nAmen said (also referring to<br />\n<br />\nAssistant Coach Lee Horowitz).<br />\n\"We llon'twouploy double standards. We try to let the players<br />\nplay their game and become<br />\nbetter players through our correcting of their mistakes.\"<br />\nWhile some players claim<br />\nthat. the team has lost their<br />\nwinning spirit, Coach Amen,<br />\ninstead, attributes the poor<br />\nseason to a lack of fundamental<br />\nplay.<br />\n\"We need to improve our<br />\ndefense,our offensive rebounding, our fast \" he said. \"I have<br />\nseen some improvement over the<br />\npast few games, especially<br />\nagainst top ranked Widener.\"<br />\nThe Jays made a strong showing<br />\nagainst the MAC leaders here last<br />\nSaturday night in a 70-57 defeat.<br />\nYet whether the team improves on the court or not,<br />\nCoach Jim Amen is going<br />\nto have to deal with some upset<br />\nplayers in the near future.<br />\nNagelberg expressed his<br />\nopinion that Amen had been<br />\nkeying on his freshman class in<br />\norder to build a strong team<br />\naround his recruits, and thus,<br />\nfor<br />\na<br />\nname<br />\nmake<br />\nhimself in the coaching ranks so<br />\nthat he may advance to the<br />\nupper university basketball divisions. \"He (Amen) changed that<br />\nbasketball program here,\" Nagelberg claimed, \"from one for<br />\nthe players to one for Jimmy<br />\nAmen.\"<br />\nThis attack was answered<br />\nsimply by the coach. \"My only<br />\ngoal here is to bring a winning<br />\nbasketball program to Hopkins,\"<br />\nhe said. \"I want us to win our<br />\ndivision and advance to the<br />\nplayoffs.

He noted that his office has<br />\nbeen working actively to foster<br />\ngood relations between the<br />\nfraternities and the community.<br />\n\"My fondest hope is that we will<br />\nhave a strong IFC to apply peer<br />\npressure to the fraternities,\" he<br />\ncommented. \"I have also suggested that officers of the frats<br />\nlive in the frat houses.\"<br />\nThough Eberhart admitted<br />\nthat the attitude of the fraternities has improved, he added<br />\nthat \"the dialogue between the<br />\nfrats and their neighbors will<br />\nhave to go on for a long time,<br />\npossibly forever.\" Some of the<br />\nfraternities' houses are in need<br />\nof repairs, and Eberhart feels<br />\nthey would do well to develop<br />\nthe interest of their alumni in<br />\nimproving the conditions of the<br />\nhouses. He also suggested that<br />\nfraternities encourage upperclass brothers to remain in the<br />\nhouse, in order to develop a<br />\nsense of community with the<br />\nneighbors, and to provide some<br />\ncontinuity from year to year.<br />\nAccording to Eberhart. \"We've<br />\nhad excellent cooperation from<br />\nthe presidents of the four<br />\nfraternities, but they still have a<br />\nway to go before they can be<br />\ncalled good neighbors. Now is<br />\ntheir opportunity to show that<br />\nthey can be responsible.\"<br /><br />\nStudent Education Committee<br />\nTo Study Curriculum Review<br />\nBY PETER CINQUEGRANI<br />\nAlthough the five-member<br />\nfaculty<br />\nCurriculum<br />\nReview<br />\nCommittee is six months behind<br />\nin its work, the Student Council<br />\nis pushing ahead with curriculum<br />\nreview.<br />\nThe faculty committee was<br />\noriginally scheduled to begin its<br />\nwork in September, but ny last<br />\nweek a reliable source reported<br />\nthat it has not yet begun.

The Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop finds itself cited by the health authorities to<br />\nimprove its facilities. Yet although the violations cited<br />\nduring the inspection are accurate, they are mostly minor<br />\nand fail to constitute a serious indictment of the shop's<br />\noperations.<br />\nMost disturbing for many people is probably the<br />\ndiscovery of mice droppings in the storeroom used by the<br />\nGCS. No evidence, however, indicates that rodents have<br />\never actually disturbed the food there. The other charges<br />\nare rather less shocking. Open milk cartons do perhaps lose<br />\ntheir sterility, but then, the second floor Gilman lobby is<br />\nfortunately not a sterile place to be while the GCS is<br />\noperating.<br />\nThe Gilman Coffee Shop stands out in sharp contrast<br />\nto Servoination as a source of nourishment on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. Servomation, to be sure, follows /all the legal<br />\nrequirements for a food vendor. But it also makes patrons<br />\npay for every bit of this consideration, and pockets a<br />\nhandsome profit besides.<br />\nThe Gilman Coffee Shop basically operates on a<br />\nnon-profit basis. Everything it carries is high in quality but<br />\nvery low in price compared to similar goods at Levering or<br />\neven in a supermarket. Even more important is an intangible benefit produced by the Coffee Shop. The daytime<br />\ncafe-type atmosphere 0 a building where students study is<br />\nvaluable and can be found nowhere else around Homewood. In this respect, the Servomation facilities do not<br />\neven come close to comparing. It is true that to overlook<br />\nlittle violations by the GCS sets a double standard, but the<br />\nshop, like a lemonade stand run by 10-year-olds on the<br />\nstreet, deserves such special status.<br /><br />\nDissenting Opinion<br /><br />\nDoctor Curbs Are No Cure<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nLast week's editorial entitled \"Cutting Costs,\" which<br />\nproposed national health insurance, regulation of doctors' fees,<br />\nand federally funded medical<br />\nschools, was, at best naive in its<br />\noversimplification and, at worst,<br />\ndangerous in its implications.<br />\nPraising the medical profession for its scientific advances,<br />\nBob Riggs quickly turns to<br />\nblame doctors for creating<br />\n\"unprecedented social problems<br />\nwhich have never been resolved<br />\nin a satisfactory manner.\" As if<br />\nthis were an unalienable truth,<br />\nhe procedes to cite an instance<br />\nof a physician charging a fee too<br />\nexhorbitant to be offset by<br />\ninsurance. Riggs states, \"Even<br />\nthough the orthopedist who set<br />\nthe cast was already right in the<br />\nhospital, and worked on the<br />\npatient for less than 10 minutes,<br />\nhe presented her with a bill of<br />\n$250.00.\" This implies that 1)<br />\nthe distance a doctor travels to<br />\nsee his patient should be considered when totalling the bill<br />\nand 2) a doctor should be paid<br />\naccording to the amount of time<br />\nhe works on a patient. The<br />\nfallacy here is obvious. What a<br />\ndoctor offers is quality, not<br />\nquantity. Should a doctor whose<br />\nbeeper drags him five miles from<br />\nthe proverbial golf course to the<br />\nhospital be paid more for his<br />\nefforts than the doctor who is<br />\non call?

It's lost<br />\nits appeal as a footstool since I can't get my feet on top<br />\nof it without banging my knees on the bottom of the<br />\ndesk. My roommates, afraid that some night it will<br />\nspontaneously combust and burn us all in our beds, have<br />\nbeen stealing a few issues at a time to wrap garbage in.<br />\nIt's a difficult (and messy) procedure to extricate them,<br />\nbut I do the best I can.<br />\nOne of the reasons I save them is to gloat over the<br />\narticles I've written (\"Look, Mom, I got my name in the<br />\npaper!\") But there's also the idea that someday, we'll<br />\nlook back at all these moldy newspapers and realize that,<br />\neven as we spoke, the News-Letter was reporting Historical Events. Somebody in the Library must agree with<br />\nme, because they spend a large amount of time and<br />\neffort binding old News-Letters in volumes and hiding<br />\nthem down on C-Level. If you're looking for some<br />\nentertaining reading and/or an excuse for not working,<br />\ncheck out the collected News-Letters from ten years ago.<br />\nYou might have to sell your soul getting the librarian to<br />\nlet you take them out, but they're worth it.<br />\nOne thing I noticed when I was reading through<br />\nthem was that even over the span of ten years, some<br />\nthings don't change. In 1969, the administration appointed a committee to investigate the Bookstore on<br />\ncharages of incompetence, based on the fact that midterms were fast approaching and many students had yet<br />\nto see their texts, WJHU was again rejected in its annual<br />\nappeal to go FM, and 200 freshmen succumbed to what<br />\nthe News-Letter said was ptomaine poisoning after<br />\neating in the dorm cafeteria.<br />\nOn other college campuses, the three years that I<br />\npicked to look at witnessed student uprisings against the<br />\ndraft, increased mobilization in Viet Nam,and outdated<br />\ndrug laws. Civil rights, coeducation and student governance were topical issues. And,on the local scene, those<br />\nwere the days of the Catonsville Nine, riots following<br />\nthe assassination of Martin Luther King, Klan activity--Some of us tend to assume that Hopkins men<br />\n(Hopkins women hadn't been invented yet) represented<br />\nthe quiet branch of the silent majority in those times of<br />\nprotest. Let it not be said, however, that the University<br />\nlacked that \"small- but vocal minority\" of radicals,<br />\nhotheads, rowdies and assorted malefactors so obviously<br />\na part of other schools. They joined together to form the<br />\nHopkins version of the Students for a Democratic<br />\nSociety. and the New University Conference. These two<br />\ngroups demonstrated wholeheartedly but mostly without much effect against military recruitment on campus<br />\nand especially against ROTC. One of their favorite games<br />\nwas \"Guerrilla Theater.\" Several SDS or NUC students<br />\nwould parade out to the ROTC drill field, act out a play<br />\n(whose participants might include \"Draft Board,\" \"Viet<br />\nCong,\" \" Uncle Sam\" and a student dressed as University President Lincoln Gordon) and \"shoot\" each other.<br />\nROTC usually ignored them, although once or twice<br />\nofficers invited the actors out for coffee to discuss<br />\ndifferences.<br />\nBut when the issue was big enotich. Hopkins men<br />\nceded no encouragement to assert their rights. The<br />\nfreshman class, in particular. could always be relied upon<br />\nto rush blindly to the fore. On April 25, 1969, the<br />\nter banner headline read. \"CITY COPS BUST<br /><br />\nDORMITORIES.\" In cooperation with Federal agents,<br />\nBaltimore City Police armed with search and seizure<br />\nwarrants nabbed three Hopkins freshmen in the dorms<br />\non narcotics charges.<br />\nBy the time officers had escorted their prisoners to<br />\nan unmarked car, a crowd of 300 students had gathered.<br />\nWhile police called for reinforcements, students surrounded the vehicle. They did not disperse even when<br />\nadditional officers arrived, until a Deputy Chief of Police<br />\nthrew a canister of tear gas into the crowd.<br />\nAfter the arrest, a large group of students went to<br />\nthe President's Mansion, awakened him and demanded<br />\nan explanation of his and the University's role in the<br />\nbust. Gordon explained that since Hopkins had dropped<br />\nits stance in loco parentis, police with warrants could<br />\nsearch and make arrests without University intervention.<br />\nMost students accepted this explanation, but a few<br />\ncamped out on the President's front steps for the night.<br />\nLater he invited them in for coffee.<br />\nNews-Letter reporter Art Levine described his role<br />\nin the bust:<br /><br />\nMINONMEMIIIIIMINI<br />\nmunity, were suddenly shouting, together, \"PIGS! PIGS!<br />\nPIGS!\" Here, on this very same placid campus, kids were<br />\nshouting like Yippies in Chicago.<br />\nThe police car in the road was quickly surrounded<br />\ntc<br />\nby chanting kids. Some students then demonstrated the<br />\nusual Hopkins lack of imagination by sitting in the road<br />\nci<br />\nand chanting, \"The whole world is watching\" before the<br />\nSE<br />\ncops even did anything. Furthermore, they were rather<br />\nr\u20ac<br />\nstupidly situated at the side of the car, unable to block<br />\nanything. Nevertheless, aware that basically it was a<br />\nin<br />\nmeaningless act, Ijoined the kids sitting down.<br />\nA<br />\nI was sitting in the middle of all these kids, and my<br />\npride demanded that I start something. Accordingly, I<br />\nstarted singing in my famous golden voice \"We Shall<br />\nOvercome.\" Oddly enough, kids actually started picking<br />\nup on it. As if that weren't enough to make me get up<br />\nright then and there and call my friends back home, I<br />\nstarted making up verses and kids started singing them,<br />\ntoo.<br />\nFive minutes later, a friend whispers to me, \"Why<br />\ndon't we chant 'We all smoke dope?\"Never one to pass<br />\nup a good opportunity, I started chanting it, and soon<br />\neryone was chanting and stomping in unison, \"We all<br />\nsmoke dope! We all smoke dope!\"(The next day when I<br />\nead in the Sun that they quoted the slogan, I said to<br />\nmyself, \"Hey, that's my chant!\")<br />\nWhile I was musing along these lines, my thoughts<br />\nwere rudely punctured by the cop who started dragging<br />\ne away. I went limp and the cop had to drag me off<br />\nut I was perfectly aware that with just one threat, one<br />\nmenacing look from the cop, I would have scampered up<br />\nand run away. The biggest joke of all was that I was<br />\nbeing applauded for my courage by a group of onlookers. I was getting all the benefits of true conviction<br />\nwithout any of the bother.<br />\nAs things turned out, I didn't have the chance to<br />\ntest my courage. The cops did it for me. I saw this cop<br />\nwhipping out this aerosol can, and my mind flashed<br />\ninstantly\u2014MACE! But instead of running away immediately like a normal person, I paused a fraction oh!<br />\nsecond to see what it looked like. Then I ran away<br />\nhurriedly, my hands covering my eyes, and I found<br />\nmyself screaming like a madman. But inwardly, and I'm<br />\nsure others felt this way, I was glad. I was baptized in<br />\nthe revolution.<br /><br />\nLack of organization plagued Hopkins students in<br />\ntheir efforts to stage a truly successful demonstration.<br />\nOften they would set up picket lines or blockade doors,<br />\nonly to discover that they were at the wrong building<br />\nor that their quarry had escaped through another exit.<br />\nMany would-be protests ended at the mere threat of<br />\npunishment. In May of 1968, Baltimore City Police<br /><br />\nDe<br />\nna<br />\nth<br />\ncal<br />\nCr,<br />\nstt.<br />\na 1<br />\nVi<br />\nint<br /><br />\nan<br />\nNzi<br />\ntul<br />\nsh<br />\npri<br />\nde<br />\nOt<br />\nCc<br />\nsid<br />\nun<br />\nth<br />\nthi<br /><br />\nstt<br />\nUr<br />\ntic<br />\nfa(<br />\ndi(<br />\nen<br /><br />\nI ran over to Royce and Sylvester, and I was happy<br />\nto see an angry crowd milling about. Then Irealized\u2014A<br />\nBUST! All the paranoia, all the fears, all those kids<br />\nflushing pipes down the toilet were right.<br />\nI was hoping that maybe, just maybe, this crowd<br />\nwould explode. No more would we be isolated from<br />\nevents. No more would I have to read only about riots at<br />\nAll these students, victims of<br />\nother colleges.<br />\nisolation, and lack of cointhroating,<br />\no<br />\nhours<br />\nendless<br /><br />\nsquelched a pernicious student demonstration which<br />\nwould, if it worked, have allowed the Good Humor Man<br />\nto peddle his wares on campus.<br />\nStudent protestors had more luck against another<br />\nkind of salesman. 40-50 students staged a \"non-obstructive sit-in\" on the steps of Levering to prevent the Dow<br />\nChemical Company representatives from recruiting<br />\nhere. Dow was making napalm, then, and the protestors<br />\ndemanded that a three-man dele tion be allowed to<br /><br />\n?ere<br /><br />\nled<br />\nthe<br />\n9ad<br />\nthe<br />\nher<br />\n9ck<br />\n's a<br /><br />\nmy<br />\nv, I<br /><br />\npresent the recruiter with a burned and bloodied doll<br />\nwrapped in Saran Wrap, a Dow product. When this<br />\nrequest was refused, 13 students blocked the exit<br />\nto the building. Threatened by police (including Hopkins<br />\nSecurity guards, Baltimore city Police and other, specially rented policemen) they moved from the door and<br />\nset up a picket line.<br />\nThe most organized, persistent, campus-wide<br />\nresistance' at Hopkins was focused against the Viet Nam<br />\nWar and especially the draft. Campus organizations<br />\nincluded the Viet Nam Committee, the Hopkins Peace<br />\nAction Committee, the Draft Resistance Group, RESPONSE, RESISTANCE, CONCERN and the Union for<br /><br />\npassed out antiwar leaflets, 700 Hopkins students<br />\ngathered for an afternoon rally in front of Gilman Hall,<br />\nand almost 7000 amassed later for a march downtown.<br />\nLater, 250 protestors attended candlelight services for<br />\nHopkins students who had died in the War.<br />\nOn October 21, 1967, between 100 and 200 Hopkins students traveled to the Capitol to participate<br />\nin a \"March on Washington,\" protesting U.S. involvement in Viet Nam. After a rally on the steps of the<br />\nPentagon, organizers asked students who were afraid of<br />\nbeing arrested to leave. Those who chose to stay would<br />\ntry to keep the Pentagon from opening the next morning.<br /><br />\nDemocracy. The News-Letter reported international and<br />\nto<br />\nrelating<br />\nnews<br />\nnational<br />\nthe War, and information on student unrest at other<br />\ncampuses. In 1967 editors Peter Hernik and Richard<br />\nCrafter, along with ex-editor Bruce Drake, joined 250<br />\nstudent body presidents and newspaper editors in signing<br />\na National Students' Association Statement against the<br />\nViet Nam War. The signers swore to refuse induction<br />\ninto the armed forces as long as the War continued.<br />\nSome Hopkins students and faculty members risked<br />\narrest in their antiwar efforts. On April 3, 1968, a<br />\nNational Day of Resistance to the War, 18 students<br />\nturned in their draft cards and another 125 signed<br />\nstatements of complicity. 40 students and one Hopkins<br />\nprofessor were arrested in February 1970 for staging a<br />\ndemonstration and sit-in at the Baltimore Draft Board<br />\nOffice. In 1967,36 Hopkins professors formed a Faculty<br />\nCommittee of Concern \"to say simply that we are on the<br />\nside of our studen.ts and against the Viet Nam War, both<br />\nunequivocally.\" All signed a petition which stated that<br />\nthey stood ready to help Hopkins students in any way<br />\nthey could.<br />\nDuring a nationally -organized War Moratorium Day,<br />\nstudents and faculty members virtually shut down<br />\nUniversity operations, engaging in massive demonstrations. Although the school did not officially close, 90<br />\nfaculty members cancelled classes so that 40 out of 52<br />\ndid not meet. Those professors who held classes faced<br />\nempty classrooms. The Student Council picketed and<br /><br />\nElia Katz, a News-Letter reporter participating in<br />\nthe demonstration, described what happened:<br /><br />\n;ing<br />\nup<br />\ne, I<br />\nem,<br /><br />\nThy<br />\n)ass<br />\n)on<br />\nall<br />\nmI<br />\nto<br /><br />\nrhts<br />\nring<br /><br />\n9ff<br /><br />\n911C<br /><br />\n' up<br />\nwas<br />\nokion<br /><br />\nto<br />\n.?op<br />\nfled<br />\nim)<br />\n.fa<br />\nva<br />\nnd<br />\nI'm<br />\nI in<br /><br />\n; in<br />\non.<br /><br />\nDrs,<br /><br />\nling<br />\nxit.<br />\nof<br />\nlice<br /><br />\n.ea<br /><br />\nWhat formed in the afternoon was a straight line of<br />\ndemonstration with MP's on one side and demonstrators<br />\non the other, with an inch or two between the two<br />\ngroups. The demonstrators sang various rouser songs,<br />\npatriotic songs, civil rights songs, and a couple of hundred people burned their draft cards, each one holding it<br />\nup for the crowd to see and applaud. Some put flowers<br />\nin the soldiers' guns. Some told the soldiers they were<br />\npeople too, and shot, I put down their guns and join us.<br />\nTwo of them did. This is not a rumor. It happened, and<br />\none was arrested immediately by the Marshals while the<br />\nother made it into our crowd. I believe he was arrested<br />\nlate later.<br />\nWe sang The Star Spangled Banner and This Land is<br />\nYour Land to them, and gave them prune juice and<br />\nFritos. I, too, tried desperately to convince some MP's of<br />\ntheir humanity and good nature, but as it got darker and<br />\ntheir rifle butts hammering on our front line became<br />\nmore and more frequent, they began looking more and<br />\nmore like a line of new General Motors cars. After the<br />\ninitial rush, no demonstrators did anything at all to cross<br />\nthe established line of demonstration. What we wanted...all we wanted..,was to be there all night.<br />\nAt midnight, I found myself, along with my friend<br />\nDouglas Wanken (you may know him\u2014he wears a turtleneck sweater, is very thin, a very nice guy)on the front<br /><br />\nhv THERE,<br />\n1.157-Fiv<br />\nTli( WAR!

We sat on the ground offering no provocation.<br />\nWhen, after a series of slight insults and minor bruises,<br />\nthe MP's and Marshals decided to advance, I was hit on<br />\nthe shoulder and on the side of the head with a billy<br />\nclub. I was lurched forward and, taking the hint, I ran<br />\nlike hell. Mr. Wanken was not so lucky. Just before I was<br />\nhit I saw an MP bring his rifle straight down on Mr.<br />\nWanken 's head. He was then dragged to the nearest van,<br />\nnot by the collar, but by the hair. He is now sleeping off<br />\na concussion.<br />\nIn nationally organized protests and in small,<br />\nUniversity-oriented demonstrations, Hopkins students<br />\naquitted themselves tolerably, but it was not until the<br />\nspring of 1970 that 'hell' finally broke loose. For two<br />\nweeks, massive student demonstrations and strikes shut<br />\ndown Johns Hopkins. The issues were military recruitment on campus, classified defense research at APL and<br />\nstudent governance.<br />\nOn Thursday, April 16, 75 students and faculty<br />\nmembers staged a half-hour sit-in in front of the<br />\nPresident's house. Denouncing University complicity in<br />\nthe Viet Nam War, their demands included University<br />\ntermination of all APL classified defense contracts. 40<br />\nactivists blocked the entrance to Levering Hall, to<br />\nprotest the presence of a Marine Corps recruiter inside.<br />\nBecause of military recruitment on campus, 200<br />\nstudents and faculty members threatened the next day<br />\nto take over Homewood House, whereupon a Circuit<br />\nCourt judge issued a ten-day restraining order against<br />\nstudent demonstrations. The Hopkins Strike Committee<br />\nhired a prominent Baltimore attorney to represent them<br />\nin further dealings with the University.<br />\nThat afternoon, Jim Claxton, President of Union<br />\nLocal 1231 which represented 450 nonprofessional<br />\nHopkins employees, announced that the Union officially<br />\nsupported the position of the Strike Committee. Over<br />\nthe weekend 50 students camped out in tents in front of<br />\nHomewood House.<br />\nBy Monday the court injunction had been lifted,<br />\nand the SAC had presented President Gordon with a<br />\nresolution demanding an end to military recruitment.<br />\nhowever. Gordon<br />\nrefused<br />\nto<br />\nact on the<br />\nresolution without canvassing students and faculty<br />\nmembers first.<br />\nDemonstrators outside Homewood House called for<br />\na strike on the following Wednesday. One after another,<br />\n, campus organizations registered their approval. The<br />\nNews-Letter was again in the forefront with its editorial:<br />\nThere are now no longer ally alternative \"legitimate\" channels to which the protestors can appeal. For<br />\nthe past two years, all student \"victories\" including the<br />\ncalendar reform issue, the Levering Hall budget controversy and the Freshman gym boycott have been won<br />\nonly when students exerted pressure outside normal<br />\nchannels.<br />\nThe administration's arrogance of power must be<br />\nmet by stern student-faculty action. A general strike can<br />\nbe used to redress our grievances with an audience that<br />\nwon't be able to afford not to listen. We endorse the<br />\nstatement of the Hopkins Strike Committee and urge all<br />\nstudents to boycott classes and participate in strike<br />\nactivities. We also call on the faculty to support their<br />\nstudents by cancelling classes and taking part in the<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe strike took place on Thursday. Class attendance<br />\nwas down by well over 50%, and demonstrators picketed<br />\nthose classes that were held. Some protestors, trying to<br />\nprevent professors from entering University parking lots.<br />\nreported getting struck by their cars.<br />\nThe next day, 10 representatives of the Hopkins<br />\nStrike Committee, including Drs. Pepper and Pfeffer,<br />\nnegotiated an agreement that led to the end of military<br />\nrecruitment at Hopkins and the formation of a summer<br />\ncommittee to draw up a plan for student governance to<br />\nbe implemented in the fall.<br />\nDuring the last week of classes, some students called<br />\nfor \"relief from academic burdens\" (namely, no finals)<br />\nso that they could respond to what they saw as a national crisis--increased mobilization and the deaths at Kent<br />\nState. Since the administration did not grant this request, those students who decided to abandon their<br />\nstudies and join the demonstrations had to weigh a<br />\nserious set of responsibilities before making a choice.<br />\nI always thought I was the first student from my<br />\nhome town to attend Johns Hopkins, but in my research I was surprised to discover that someone had<br />\nindeed come before me. In 1967 John Haydon, a student from Beverly, Massachusetts, left Hopkins for<br />\nAustralia in order to avoid the draft. He returned in<br />\n1968, having chosen not to run away, but to stay an.<br />\nresist. The News-Letter ran an article listing the official<br />\ncharges against him. It also reported that he would<br />\nprobably face a prison term.<br />\nI'd like to find out what happened to him.<br /><br />\nPAGE 10 I FEBRUARY 9, 1979<br />\nBB =Milli<br /><br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series Presents...<br /><br />\n\"B unuel's triumph<br /><br />\nMI NEM MINI MIMI NMIal MI<br />\n\"A TANTALIZING TEASE...<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nI,, adults who've done \u2022 little hying.. \u2022 delught in the watchin.<br /><br />\nLuis<br />\nBunuers<br /><br />\n. 7,T;<br />\n,<br />\n\u2022 .4'<br /><br />\n\u00b0MARX BROTHERS WEEKEND\u00b0<br /><br />\nThat<br />\nObscure<br />\nObject<br />\nOfDesire<br />\n(\"Cet Obscur Objet du Dew')<br /><br />\nChico<br /><br />\nGrouch\u00b0<br /><br />\nZeppo<br /><br />\nHarpo<br /><br />\nIn<br /><br />\nDUCK SOUP<br /><br />\n7:008 10:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nHORSEFEATHERS<br /><br />\n8:30<br /><br />\nFRIDAY, FEB. 9<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\nSATURDAY, FEB 10<br />\nREMSEN 1<br /><br />\n11:30 p.m.<br /><br />\n7:30 and 10:00<br /><br />\nFebruary 9 8 10<br /><br />\nFriday 8 Saturday<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nCharles and 34th Street<br /><br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nAdmission: $1.00<br /><br />\nSeniors: $ .75<br /><br />\nDOUBLE FEATURE: $1.50<br /><br />\nAdmission $1.00<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThat<br /><br />\n(kell\u2022rte<br />\n(ire<br />\nv,Oftjes<br /><br />\nOffice of the Chaplain (338-8187)<br /><br />\n0111111111mommummummmommellins<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins<br />\nChamber Orchestra<br /><br />\n: MUSIC LOVERS BE<br />\nGRATEFUL!<br /><br />\nco/tit:ail\" imaile4 you<br />\nGRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE<br />\nDirected By Jerry Garcia<br />\nI<br />\nShriver Hall* Feb. 23 &amp; 24*<br />\n7:30 &amp; 10:30* Admission $2.00<br />\nI<br />\nAFTER<br />\nTHE<br />\nI<br />\nI 7:30 DEAD<br />\nMOVIE<br /><br />\nCOUNTRY ROCK DANCE WITHI<br />\nGreat Hall* I<br />\nFREEWATER<br />\n1<br />\nFebruary 23* 10:00 till 2:00* 1<br />\nI<br />\nstudents $1.00 general $2.00<br /><br />\nr<br />\n1<br />\n9<br /><br />\nNIGHTHAWK CONCERT<br />\nWith Catfish Hodge Band<br />\nShriver Hall* March 16* 8:00 I<br />\nI<br />\n*Students $3.00 General $5.00 I<br />\nCHESTER'S PLACE<br />\nCOFFEE HOUSE<br />\nLittle Theatre in Levering Hall<br />\nEvery Wednesday From<br />\n9:00 - 1:00<br /><br />\nOffice of the Chaplain - 338-8187<br /><br />\nto(Wend a/n<br /><br />\nOPEN<br />\nREHEARSAL<br />\n?T#u\u20ackv, L46. 15<br />\nat 8:00ft.m.<br />\nthe WiNteit<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\ngivitireit eie,aa<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n......<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nNVWS,LETTER.

His vitality of<br />\nform, vision and social commentary<br />\nareevident in his most recent effort,<br />\nThat Obscure Object of Desire. After<br />\neach of his films, Bunuel insists he is<br />\nretiring, yet he continues to come back<br />\nand give his viewers another unique look<br />\nat contemporary society. In That Obscure<br />\nObject, he examines man's inexplicable<br />\npursuit of ideals of desire.<br />\nSince the first image of his first film,<br />\nUn Chien Andalou (1928), in which a<br />\n.Orl's eye is slit with a razor, Bunuel's<br />\nfilms have been concerned with the<br />\nproblem of sight and seeing. In this new<br />\nfilm, the problem is obscured sight.<br />\nMathieu (Fernando Rey), pursues Conchita (Carole Bouquet and Angela<br />\nMolina)throughout the film, yet he can<br />\nnever explain his desire for her. Even<br />\nwhen they seem to have parted for good,<br />\nhe inevitably bumps into her and resumes<br />\nthe pursuit. Conchita represents this<br />\nobject or ideal for which Mathieu lusts.<br />\nHer response runs from frigidity to wild<br />\npassion, yet their relationship is never<br />\nconsummated. Mathieu continually gets<br />\nclose, but Conchita always eludes him.<br />\nBunuel has employed a perplexing<br />\nsurrealistic device to bring the viewer into<br />\nthis chase after Conchita. She becomes<br />\nobscure and elusive to the audience<br />\nbecause Bunuel has two actresses playing<br />\nthe one role. They have similar looks with<br />\nmany visible differences, but the way<br />\nBunuel dresses and exchanges them (in<br />\nthe same scene, one can walk off-camera<br />\nand the other will walk back on) the<br />\nviewer is thrown into confusion as to<br />\nwhich actress is being pursued. We can see<br />\nthrough Mathieu's problem, but Bunuel<br />\ndemands active participation by eliminating dramatic irony while calling on the<br />\nviewer to identify Conchita while Mathieu pursues her.<br />\nThe film consists of flashbacks to the<br />\nstory of Mathieu's pursuit, as told to a<br />\ncaptive audience in a coach on a train<br />\nfrom Seville to Paris. Mathieu's narrative<br />\ncatches up and merges with the narrative<br />\nof the film as the train is approaching<br />\nMadrid. All the passengers in the coach<br />\nare heading for Paris, but they have<br />\ndecided to make a stopover in Madrid.<br />\nBunuel uses the train, which blindly<br />\npursues some destination down the tracks<br />\nonly to continue on to another, as an<br />\nanalogy to Mathieu's chase. He intersperses quick cuts of a train speeding<br />\nalong the tracks to advance his exposition<br />\nof these ideas of motion and pursuit.<br />\nInterestingly, in these cuts, Bunuel uses<br />\ntwo different types of trains to serve the<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nOTHER<br />\nHALF<br />\nOF THE<br /><br />\nsame role, in the way he uses two actresses to play the role of Conchita.<br />\nOn the periphery of the film is the<br />\nconstant threat of terrorism. Bombings,<br />\nhijackings and paranoid discussions pervade the film and the psyche of its<br />\ncharacters. Mathieu fears being pursued<br />\nby the terrorists, and Conchita, unknown<br />\nto him, is a member of one of these<br />\ngroups. The terrorists are an adjunct to<br />\nthe theme of the film; they blindly<br />\ncommit acts of violence in pursuit of<br />\nsome obscure, ideal form of society. In a<br />\nvoice over broadcast at the end of the<br />\nfilm, Bunuel makes a mockery of all these<br />\norganizations by listing numerous acronyms that represent groups responsible<br />\nfor the terrorism, without any reference<br />\nto the ideals behind their acts of violence.<br />\nAll the elements of the film are an<br />\nexposition on the basic theme of pursuit<br />\nfor that obscure object of desire.<br />\nBunuel never explains this desire, but<br />\nhe makes poignant comments on the<br />\nsocial malaise that results from it. When<br />\nConchita allows Mathieu to get close, he<br />\nis compelled to touch her, hold her and<br />\nfondle her. Yet she continually withdraws, and when she challenges his lust,<br />\nhe can only turn away, embarrassed.<br />\nThrough Mathieu's unending, yet unexplained pursuit - of Conchita, Bunuel<br />\nconfronts society with its primal physical<br />\nattraction for the opposite sex. The<br />\nviewer becomes frustrated with Mathieu's<br />\nfailure to consummate, confused by the<br />\ndouble identity of Conchita and indicted<br />\nalong with Mathieu for this primal lust<br />\nwhich rules over any ideals of love or<br />\ndevotion. That Obscure Object of Desire<br />\nis one of Bunuel's less complex films<br />\nbecause it doesn't contain wild dream<br />\nsequences, distortions of time and reality<br />\nand other surrealistic effects; perhaps<br />\nbecause of this, his powerfully vital and<br />\ndisturbing social commentary rings loud<br />\nand clear.<br />\n--StepheriBarr<br /><br />\nSpeaker Steve Tbalea,<br />\nFaorn WA's Young<br />\nLea6eaship Council<br />\nFaielag<br /><br />\na<br />\ninna memoir<br /><br />\nTuesday, Feb. 13<br />\nat 7:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nFeb. 9<br /><br />\nOne9<br />\nSbabbat<br /><br />\nListening/Viewing<br />\nRoom<br /><br />\nKosbea Dining Hall<br />\n50c donation<br />\nrequested<br /><br />\n(Oiranen: $3.50)<br /><br />\n6:45 p.m.<br /><br />\n.

The men<br />\n(7-2) won 83-28, while the<br />\nwomen (6-4) breezed to a<br />\nsurprisingly easy 77-48 victory.<br />\nAccording to Hopkins coach<br />\nTim Welsh, \"The men's part was<br />\nexactly what was expected.<br />\nIt was what we anticipated in<br />\nscore. The women's meet was<br />\nunexpected. We expected a<br />\nmuch closer meet, but the<br />\nwomen swam particularly well.\"<br />\nThe victories were particularly<br />\nimportant because of the order<br />\nof events. As Welsh put it, \"It<br />\nallowed us to qualify for events<br />\nwe hadn't swum yet.\"<br />\nIndeed, the men qualified in<br />\nsix more events and now have at<br />\nleast one entry in each of the<br />\nsixteen Division III Nationals<br />\ncategories. The women qualified<br />\ntheir first two swimmers for the<br />\nAIAW meet (Jackie Johnson in<br />\ntwo events and Monika Bay in<br />\none). In addition, several pool<br />\nrecords were broken.<br />\nIn the first event, the 1650<br />\nyard freestyle for Men, Tim<br />\nCollins and Malcolm McGinnis<br />\nqualified for Nationals while<br />\nfinishing first and second to put<br />\nthe Blue Jays ahead to stay, 8-1.<br />\nThe women qualified their first<br />\nswimmer, Jackie Johnson, in the<br />\n100 yd. freestyle. Later, Johnson qualified for the 50 yd.<br />\nfreestyle. Monika Bay qualified<br />\nin the 200 yd. freestyle.<br />\nJohnson had never swum<br />\ncompetitively before her freshman year at Hopkins (she is<br />\nnow a junior). \"I always wanted<br />\nto swim, but never had the<br />\nmotivation,\" she explained. \"I<br />\nswam here because Hopkins was<br />\na small school and I didn't have<br />\nto try out.\" Once timid, Johnson's confidence has grown<br />\nsteadily over the past two years,<br />\nto the point where she now<br />\nsays, \"I expect to win the 50<br />\nand 100 yd. freestyles at the<br />\nMAC's (the Middle Atlantic<br />\nChampionships).<br />\nConference<br /><br />\nprevious JHU pool record, the The MAC's will be held at<br />\nthrough<br />\n200 yd. breaststroke and the Hopkins Thursday<br />\n400 yd. freestyle relay (along Saturday, February 22-24.<br />\nAnother of the swim team's<br />\nwith teammates Steve Fish,<br />\nFrancis Florez and Bill Bender). great success stories is Bill<br />\nHe had already qualified for the Smiddy.

If the team was<br />\nwinning, most of these complaints would never be registered.\"<br />\nWith respect to the threats<br />\nof transfer and quitting, Scott<br />\nadded, \"Some players always<br />\nthreaten to leave when they are<br />\nunhappy with the season's progression. It happens everywhere.<br />\nI am fully behind all our teams<br />\nand coaches here. They do a<br />\nfine job.

One player felt that if he were given the<br />\nfreedom to shoot more he would<br />\nbe able to help the team win.<br />\nAmen said (also referring to<br /><br />\nAssistant Coach Lee Horowitz).<br />\n\"We llon'twouploy double standards.
