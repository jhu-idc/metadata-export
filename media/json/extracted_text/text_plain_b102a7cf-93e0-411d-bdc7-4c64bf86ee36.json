Rham,<br />\nthe Deputy Chief of Indian Mission in Washington, D.C., came<br />\nto Homewood to speak about India's present foreign policy<br />\ntoward South Africa, both the<br />\npresent pro-apartheid Botha administration and the African National Congress. Sponsored by<br />\nthe Indian Students Association<br />\nand co-sponsored by the International Studies Fund and<br />\nChaplain's Office of Johns<br />\nHopkins, the lecture was held in<br />\nthe Multi-Purpose Room in AMR<br />\nI at 8:00 pm.<br />\nIntroduced by Deepti Kharod,<br />\nthe president of the Indian<br />\nStudents Association, Rham<br />\nbegan by giving what he called \"a<br />\nhistorical perspective of what is<br />\nbehind the rationale of Indian<br />\npolicy toward South Africa.\"<br />\nRham maintained that South<br />\nAfrica was \"the laboratory for<br />\nthe 'Indian experiment,\u2014 that is,<br />\nthe philosophy of using nonviolent means for achieving<br />\npolitical ends, \"[which] was<br />\nevolved, conceived, born, and<br />\nperfected in South Africa.\"<br />\nHe continued by relating some<br />\nof Gandhi's experiences in South<br />\nAfrica, and how they shaped later<br />\nIndian foreign policy. Rham<br />\ndescribed the social situation in<br />\nSouth Africa in Gandhi's time,<br />\n<br />\nsaving, \"If one was white, one<br />\nwas infallible.. . .If one was<br />\nblack, one was inferior,\" later<br />\nadding that \". . present-day<br />\nSouth Africa is similar.\"<br />\nGandhi's fight against inequality in India, Rham said, grew to<br />\nencompass the inequalities of all<br />\nsubjugated peoples, including<br />\nthose of Southeastern Asia and,<br />\nmost importantly, South Africa.<br />\n\"Our freedom [that of the Indian<br />\npeople was therefore indivisible<br />\nfrom that of peoples around the<br />\nworld,- commented Rham.<br />\nRham brought up India's precedent of protesting ,partheid in<br />\nSouth Africa as evidence of its<br />\nsolidarity with the subjugated<br />\nSouth African people.<br />\nRham's introduction of India's<br />\n\"non-aligned\" philosophy of<br />\nsolidarity with \"freedom fighters<br />\naround the world,\" including<br />\nthose in South Africa, led into his<br />\nthoughts on the present-day social<br />\nand political situation in South<br />\nAfrica, and India's continued<br />\npolicy of protest toward the Botha<br />\nadministration. Repeatedly bringing up the injustices of apartheid<br />\nSouth Africa, Rham related India's present policy toward South<br />\nAfrica, that is the policy of no<br />\npolitical or economic relations<br />\nwith the Botha administration. He<br />\nurged that the countries of the<br />\nworld \"bring upon South Africa<br />\nall the pressure they can possibly<br />\nbear.\"<br />\nAfter the lecture, Rham field-<br />\n<br />\ned numerous questions from the<br />\naudience. These included questions about possible Indian<br />\nmilitary aid to the African National Congress, the current<br />\nreluctancy of Great Britain to<br />\nbring sufficient pressure upon<br />\nSouth Africa, and Indian aid to<br />\nthe \"frontline states,\" those<br />\ncountries bordering South Africa.<br />\nQuestions from the audience were<br />\nso numerous that Rham was<br />\nunable to answer them all in the<br />\nallotted time, and continued the<br />\nquestion-answer session after the<br />\nlecture to those interested.<br />\nRham himself is currenily<br />\nDeputy Chief of the Indian<br />\nMinistry in Washington, D.C.,<br />\nand has served in the Indian<br />\nForeign Service since 1962.<br />\nRham received a Master's Degree<br />\nin Economics from the Delhi<br />\nSchool of Economics, and has<br />\nsince served in the Indian Missions -in Paris, Khartoum, New<br />\nYork, Bangkok, and Tokyo, and<br />\nhas served as Indian High Commissioner to Zambia and<br />\nBotswana.<br />\nDeepti Kharod, president of the<br />\nIndian Students Association, later<br />\nsaid that the ISA hopes to sponsor similar lectures this upcoming semester, including one about<br />\ninternational economics and one<br />\nabout Indian culture.

We must<br />\nallow the exasperated people to<br />\nappear and be heard. Their voices<br />\nhave not been heard because of<br />\nthe noise of bombing.\"<br />\nStressing the need for unity in<br />\nLebanon, Maksoud stated that,<br />\n\"We must love Lebanon in its<br />\nentirety.\"<br />\nPleading to the youth,<br />\nMaksoud stated, \"The cedars of<br />\nLebanon are a symbol that we<br />\nshould be evergreen.

To land a decent<br />\none. The mission.<br />\nLast summer I stayed in<br />\nBaltimore. I worked at a decent<br />\ninternship. I began each day with<br />\na ride on the Hopkins shuttle. The<br />\nbest excursion was when a group<br />\nof children filed aboard with their<br />\nchaperons, something about a<br />\nvisit to an industrial museum. The<br />\nboys called the girls, \"things\"<br />\nand the girl who protested did so<br />\nby poking a boy in the ribs and<br />\nrefusing to say the word \"thing,\"<br />\ninstead referring to \"that word.\"<br />\nIgnoring the feminine threat, one<br />\nboy accused another of turning<br />\ninto a \"thing,\" to which the second replied, \"No, don't worry.<br />\nThis is a thing-protector.\" He<br />\ntapped his digital watch.<br />\nAt work I learned two lessons.<br />\nNever use more than one size of<br />\npaper. The smaller sheets will get<br />\nlost. Always be polite in conversation. Never know when you<br />\nhave to call again.<br />\nLiving in Baltimore in the summer I learned one lesson. Don't<br />\ndo it again.<br />\nLooking at the internship<br />\npossibilities for this year, some of<br />\nwhich include \"three to four page<br />\nautobiography and several personal references\" or which find<br />\n1000 applicants for 10 positions,<br />\nI wonder if! have been caught in<br />\nthe vortex of \"careerism.\" That<br />\nvaguely dirty word refers to a<br />\nnew trend among college<br />\nstudents, the intense preparation<br />\nfor a career and the neglect of<br />\n\"liberal\" education. A Carnegie<br />\nFoundation report released last<br />\nmonth found nine out of ten high<br />\nschool students and parents saw<br />\ncollege as a place to prepare for<br />\na job. This is no surprise.<br />\nThe confrontation between<br />\nthose who think themselves practical and those who think<br />\nthemselves scholarly is a little like<br />\nthe scene on the bus. The former<br />\nare the boys, proud of gadgets<br />\nand impervious in a smug credo<br />\nof successs. The latter are like the<br />\ngirls, most of whom took the<br />\nabuse, or like the lone critic,<br />\nunable to confront the actual<br />\nissue.<br />\nSometimes the careerists will<br />\ntaunt the others about \"real<br />\nwork.\" But in a society where the<br />\nmost money is made by acting,<br />\nplaying baseball or shuffling<br />\nmerger papers, who is to say<br />\nwhat this mythical real work is?<br />\n<br />\nIn return, the once-proud<br />\nacademy boasts of \"culture.\" To<br />\na generation long past being lost<br />\nand now happily remembering<br />\n\"Happy Days\" in place of reality, this too is just an empty brag.<br />\nThe problem is a defect of our<br />\nculture. Although higher education should not shrink from any<br />\nchallenge, neither should it be expected to alter single-handedly the<br />\nvalues of society by impressing<br />\nupon every passerby for four<br />\nyears the importance of \"higher<br />\neducation.\" If change is to come,<br />\nit cannot come by a decree of core<br />\ncurriculum or with a composition<br />\nrequirement. That sort of thing<br />\nbreeds contempt and a dishonest<br />\ninterest.<br />\nThere is an attitude problem involved all around. In the<br />\ndogmatic attack, people suppose<br />\nthat what is good for one is good<br />\nfor many. Whether it is the goal<br />\nof becoming a doctor or a lawyer,<br />\nthere is something to be said for<br />\ndreams and for the single-minded<br />\npursuit.<br />\nFurthermore, there is no real<br />\nschism, only the legacy of<br />\nDescartes, Marx, and wellintentioned parents. If the practical and the ideal are mutually<br />\nexclusive, it is only because they<br />\nare believed to be. Without that<br />\nrealization, only makeshift solutions will be manufactured.<br />\nEducation. To find it.

This is<br />\nwhy I attacked him and not Dr.<br />\nGordon and Dr. Gottfredson.<br />\nThat the latter are faculty<br />\nmembers and the former a student<br />\ndid not at all influence my action.<br />\nFor Dr. Gordon, however, I<br />\nmerely \"tried to isolate and intimidate [Mr. Gergyes] in a manner not likely to get far if tried<br />\nwith faculty.\" This shows that he<br />\ndid not understand the cause and<br />\npurpose of my letter which I<br />\nmade a point to put in clear and<br />\nsimple terms.<br />\n3) The News-Letter published<br />\non November 21 a letter by a<br />\nmember of the Black Student<br />\nUnion (BSU) who asserts that<br />\nMr. Gergyes himself recently<br />\nsent an apologetic note to the<br />\nBSU about his articles and to<br />\nclarify his stance on the matter.<br />\nThis fact reinforces my claim<br />\nmaking it a lot less ridiculous than<br />\nDr. Gordon thinks and wants<br />\nothers to believe. Why would the<br />\nScience Editor send a written note<br />\nof apology to the BSU if he felt<br />\nor knew that he had done such \"a<br />\ngood job\" as Dr. Gordon<br />\npretends?<br />\nI would like to suggest that Mr.<br />\nGergyes' letter to the BSU be<br />\npublished by the News-Letter<br />\nsince through his articles he insulted (perhaps unintentionally)<br />\nnot only members of the BSU,<br />\nbut also blacks outside that<br />\norganization,<br />\nnon-blacks,<br />\nundergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents. All deserve an apology.<br />\nEric Tevoedjre<br />\n<br />\nThe writer is in error. On October 24, Joe Gergyes wrote a<br />\nprivate letter to members of the<br />\nBlack Student Union thanking<br />\nthem for reading and reviewing<br />\nhis recent article on research being conducted on group differences in IQ. Gergyes expressed his concern about allegations<br />\nofsensationalism and bigotry but<br />\nwelcomed members ofthe B.S. U.<br />\nto express their opinions on the<br />\nsubject on these pages. No<br />\napology was made whatsoever.<br />\n<br />\nChasing French Ducks<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nA few thoughts on reading<br />\nPresident Muller's interview in<br />\nlast week's News-Letter.<br />\nOn the occupation of Garland<br />\nHall he noted that only verbal<br />\npersuasion would have been effective. The \"would\" needs<br />\nmore emphasis; for, despite the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica's willingness to negotiate,<br />\nDr. Muller refused all meetings<br />\nat the time. His prerogative, of<br />\ncourse, but it makes talk of \"verbal persuasion\" after the fact a<br />\nlittle disingenuous.<br />\nOn his claim that the Trustees<br />\nwere unanimous in their refusal<br />\nto totally divest. While the<br />\nTrustees' statement<br />\nwas<br />\nunanimously adopted at the<br />\nOct.25th meeting, it is clearly<br />\nstated in that document that it is<br />\n\"the judgement of the prevailing<br />\nmajority of the Board of<br />\n<br />\nTrustees\" that total divestment<br />\n\"would not represent a prudent<br />\ncourse of action.\" Obviously in<br />\na split decision the issue of conflict of interest is of importance.<br />\nFinally, the question of who is<br />\nout chasing French ducks will be<br />\ndecided in the courts. Perhaps<br />\nDr.Muller is indeed correct in his<br />\nassessment that no impropriety<br />\noccurs when a member, having<br />\ndutifully declared her/himself in<br />\nconflict of interest then proceeds<br />\nto argue and vote for those interests. The outcome will be<br />\neducational for many.<br />\nPhilip Murphy<br />\nP.S. Speaking of education, a<br />\nnumber of correspondents in the<br />\nletter columns of the last two<br />\nissues of the News-Letter referred<br />\nto Nelson Mandela as an \"avowed communist.\" According to<br />\nWebster's, that means he is a selfdeclared communist. I had always<br />\nbeen impressed by his eloquent<br />\n<br />\nexplanation during the Treason<br />\nTrials of why as a parliamentarian his goals are different from<br />\nthose of a communist.

But then you went on to<br />\nexpress other feelings and concerns that lead me to believe that<br />\nyou are quite confused as to what<br />\npoint Mr. Faidley was making in<br />\nhis letter, \"Wipe Your Palms.\"<br />\nAs I interpreted it, Mr.<br />\nFaidley's letter was not condemning the White Heterosexual<br />\nMale or any one else for that matter. He was basically making the<br />\nstatement, \"We've come a long<br />\nway, and it hasn't been easy.\"<br />\nRegardless of how oppressed you<br />\nthink you are (and I trust you<br />\nweren't serious), you have not<br />\nhad to tolerate any of the pre-<br />\n<br />\nAs a very concerned member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, I'm sure<br />\nthat I was not the only one to find<br />\nreading last week's editorial<br />\npages a draining experience; and<br />\nas a member of the Coalition, I<br />\nfound it even more so. Since the<br />\nstart of this year, the Coalition<br />\nhas come under such massive attack from the community that we<br />\nrepeatedly find ourselves spending an unprecedented amount of<br />\ntime and energy defending<br />\neverything from our goals to our<br />\norganization to our tactics. Again<br />\nand again we are accused of the<br />\nsame things in editorial letters:<br />\nthat the majority of blacks in S.<br />\nAfrica do not approve of sanctions, that Divestment by foreign<br />\ninvestors will only hurt the<br />\nblacks, that our tactics are<br />\ncounter-productive<br />\nand/or<br />\nalienating, that Divestment can do<br />\nno good in S. Africa but will in-<br />\n<br />\nstead damage this University, and<br />\nof course, that it's none of our<br />\nbusiness what this University<br />\ndoes with its money.<br />\nI took it as an indication that<br />\nthese criticisms needed no further<br />\nrepetition when last week I inserted a clean piece of paper in<br />\nmy typewriter before I even read<br />\nthe editorial letters. After reading<br />\nthem, I am reassured that I was<br />\nnot over-reacting. Furthermore,<br />\ndespite my vow that I would not<br />\nperpetuate this cycle and defend<br />\nthe Coalition once again, I am<br />\nstill tempted to do so. I restrain<br />\nmyself because I am aware that<br />\nthe Coalition has more than adequately defended itself against all<br />\nof these charges more than once.<br />\nI write this letter only to ask if our<br />\nopponents have been paying any<br />\nattention whatsoever to our<br />\nresponses. Being continually<br />\nforced to justify the same actions<br />\nleads me to believe that we are<br />\nfighting a losing battle against individuals who are in no way<br />\nserious about resolving the issues<br />\nthey raise, but who have instead<br />\nclosed their minds to any information that might conflict<br />\nwith their own and are now resorting to mere harassment.<br />\nThis same attitude is evident in<br />\nthose who profess to champion<br />\nour goals but condemn our tactics. The Coalition welcomes<br />\nanyone who feels they have found<br />\na way to further the antiApartheid cause and to help<br />\nblacks in S. Africa achieve the<br />\nrights and privileges they<br />\ndeserve, to do so. The tactical<br />\nquestion should not be at the<br />\nforefront of this movement. Not<br />\nonly are we open to all suggestions made within our group and<br />\nto members of our own group, we<br />\nwould fully endorse any antiApartheid movement separate<br />\nfrom our own on this campus.<br />\nUltimately, we realize as many of<br />\nour opponents do not seem to,<br />\nthat the end is the most important<br />\naspect of any move for change<br />\nand that the means should be only secondary.<br />\nIt seems that at this stage most<br />\narguments for and against divestment, and for and against the<br />\nCoalition, have been fully explored in these editorial pages.<br />\nFurther attacks along the same<br />\nlines only compel the Coalition to<br />\nagain defend itself and indicate<br />\nthat someone is deliberately not<br />\nlistening. It is apparent now that<br />\nthe editorial shouting match of<br />\nthis semester is growing increasingly futile. Action is the only<br />\nway that the S. African racist<br />\nregime will fall and that the<br />\nsenseless suffering there will end.<br />\nI urge anyone who feels in deep<br />\ndisagreement with the Coalition<br />\non a tactical basis alone to take<br />\nthis to heart and initiate any action that they believe will do more<br />\ngood for S. African blacks than<br />\nours has.<br />\nSondra Guttman<br />\n<br />\nWay Off the Mark<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt's important to knock a few<br />\nholes in President Muller's<br />\narguments concerning divestment<br />\nand the conflict of interest case<br />\nContinued on Page 11<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/11<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from Page 10<br />\nagainst the Hopkins Trustees who<br />\nopposed divestment on October<br />\n27. Much more will be written on<br />\nthis topic, as the case will soon<br />\nbe pending in the Baltimore<br />\ncourts. In the last News-Letter,<br />\nMuller described concerns about<br />\nconflicts of interest and the corporate priorities of our Board of<br />\nTrustees as \"balderdash\" and<br />\ncalled the whole issue \"a<br />\ncanard.\" He went on to say that<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica doesn't understand conflicts of interest, since \"The conflict arises when interests are not<br />\ndisclosed.\" According to the article, \"Muller said that the<br />\nassociation of certain Trustees to<br />\ncorporations like Maryland National Bank is well known, even<br />\nto the Coalition, and therefore, a<br />\nconflict of interest does not<br />\nexist.\"<br />\nWe were quite surprised that so<br />\nmuch nonsense appeared in just<br />\none interview, so we asked<br />\nMuller in writing if in fact all<br />\nthese quotes were valid. Apparently so . . .<br />\nFirst, Muller is way off the<br />\nmark on the law. Simply<br />\nacknowledging conflict of interest<br />\ndoes not allow someone to go<br />\nahead and engage in a vote. This<br />\ncontradicts Hopkins' own policy<br />\nstatement, as well as Maryland<br />\nstate law.<br />\nSecond, Muller somehow<br />\nbelieves that the Coalition already<br />\nknows all the conflicts of interest<br />\nof Trustees, so it was not important for them to be acknowledged. Not so. If we knew them all<br />\nalready, we wouldn't be spending<br />\nso much time researching the<br />\nTrustees in various Who's Who<br />\nbooks trying to match names to<br />\ncorporations.<br />\nWhile we're on the topic, did<br />\nanyone at Hopkins know that<br />\nSteven Muller himself is on the<br />\nBoard of Directors of a company<br />\nthat until June had a South<br />\nAfrican direct operation? While<br />\norganizing the Sullivan Principles<br />\npartial divestment in September,<br />\n1985 Muller should have disclosed his own conflict of interest on<br />\nSouth Africa investments.<br />\nAgain from the article,<br />\n\"Muller also said that the Coalition was 'counting Trustees<br />\nEmeritus' among those who supposedly have ties to Maryland<br />\nNational.\" That's balderdash.<br />\nDoesn't Muller know that there<br />\nare no Hopkins Trustees Emeritus<br />\non the Board of Directors of<br />\nMaryland National? There are<br />\nseven Maryland National directors on Hopkins' regular Board of<br />\nTrustees, including four on the<br />\nInvestment Committee.<br />\nMuller's final point on divestment in the interview was that the<br />\nOctober 27 decision was<br />\nunanimous. Well, by tradition, all<br />\ndecisions of the Hopkins Board of<br />\nTrustees are unanimous. Had as<br />\nmany as two dozen of the<br />\nTrustees with conflicts of interest<br />\nabstained from discussion and<br />\nvoting on the issue, it is<br />\nreasonable to suspect that the<br />\nboard might have unanimously<br />\ndecided on the proposal they were<br />\nsupposed to consider\u2014i.e. total<br />\ndivestment.<br />\nThat's a critique of all of<br />\nMuller's points on conflicts of interest and divestment. As to<br />\n<br />\nMuller's comment that \"It would<br />\nhave been very difficult to try to<br />\nevict the Coalition (during our occupation of 'Mandela Hall') by<br />\nany means other than verbal persuasion,\" he left out the fact that<br />\nrepeated requests by the Coalition<br />\nfor a verbal discussion with<br />\nMuller during the occupation<br />\nwere denied.<br />\nIn any campaign like the struggle for divestment, tempers will<br />\nflare and people will misspeak.<br />\nThe Coalition is a very selfcritical group and openly addresses its own failings. We know<br />\nthat Steven Muller will, in the<br />\nsame spirit, either retract or defend the positions he took in the<br />\nNews-Letter interview.<br />\nFor the Steering Committee of<br />\nthe Coalition,<br />\nLeslie Wade<br />\n<br />\nDethroning Reason<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLast Tuesday evening the<br />\nLebanese students at Johns<br />\nHopkins presented a Lebanese Independence celebration. This<br />\nevent was sponsored in part by<br />\nthe GRO, the departments of<br />\nFrench & Near Eastern Studies,<br />\nas well as Middle East Airlines.<br />\nOn the agenda was the Ambassador of Lebanon, as well as<br />\nthe Ambassador of the League of<br />\nArab States,Clovis Maksoud. It<br />\nis quite ironic that a representative of this organization was invited to speak on a Lebanese \"independence day\" celebration,<br />\nwhen in fact the League of Arab<br />\nStates legitimized the occupation<br />\nby Syria of a sizeable portion of<br />\nLebanon in 1976\u2014declaring the<br />\nSyrian troops to be the majority<br />\nof an \"all-Arab peace-keeping<br />\nforce.\" The mandate given to<br />\nSyria was maintained by this<br />\norganization despite Syria's open<br />\ndesires to annex Lebanon. To this<br />\nend, Syria does not even maintain<br />\ndiplomatic relations with Beirut<br />\nand regularly violates Lebanese<br />\n\"independence.\" Furthermore,<br />\nthe Arab League's major preoccupation, and indeed almost main<br />\njustification historically, has been<br />\nthe political, propaganda,<br />\neconomic, and military offensive<br />\nagainst Israel.<br />\nAt the event, the Lebanese Ambassador's representative gave a<br />\nmoving speech on Lebanon's<br />\nspirit to survive, and called for<br />\nthe removal of foreign troops<br />\nfrom his nation. This seemed<br />\nquite a reasonable and promising<br />\nposition. However, when the<br />\nAmbassador from the League of<br />\nArab States addressed the audience, the first statement was<br />\nthat America's relations with<br />\nIsrael should be permanently<br />\naltered due to the disclosure of the<br />\nAmerican-Iranian arms deal.<br />\nClaiming that America has been<br />\naffected adversely by its relationship with Israel is his entitled<br />\nopinion\u2014what relevance it had<br />\nwith Lebanon's independence day<br />\nwas not the clearest thing that<br />\nevening.<br />\nIn his address, Mr. Maksoud<br />\nrepeated the often heard panacea<br />\nthat if Israel withdraws her troops<br />\nfrom the narrow southern security zone it has in Lebanon, peace<br />\nwill be at hand in all of Lebanon<br />\nby the bolstering of that nation's<br />\n<br />\ncentral government.

And our analyses,<br />\nwhich involve estimating how<br />\nlarge an impact the average IQ<br />\ndifference has in various social<br />\narenas, have been reviewed<br />\nfavorably\u2014in print as well as in<br />\nprivate correspondence\u2014by experts in relevant disciplines.<br />\nSo why is this research, like the<br />\nresearch documenting the IQ difference itself, often summarily<br />\nrejected without examination?<br />\nWhy, in fact, do editors of scientific journals often balk at<br />\npublishing such research, even<br />\nwhen they volunteer that it is<br />\nscientifically sound, and even<br />\n\"important?\" And why do normally irascible scientists who are<br />\nthemselves convinced that the IQ<br />\ngap is real nonetheless observe<br />\nthe current taboo against discussing it publicly? In other contexts<br />\nsuch behaviors would be inconceivable, or at least embarrassing, to people who normally<br />\nvalue liberty and unfettered<br />\nscience.<br />\nThe answer probably lies with<br />\nthe common belief that mere<br />\ndiscussion of group IQ differences is harmful, even when<br />\nthe IQ differences are real. Thus,<br />\none commonly sees references,<br />\nlike those in recent News-Letters,<br />\nto our research and similar work<br />\nas \"dangerous racism\" and<br />\n\"psychological lynching,\" as<br />\nwell as comparisons of that work<br />\nwith \"other forms of oppression\"<br />\nsuch as Hitler's racist ideology,<br />\nApartheid, Ku Klux Klan lynchings, and slavery. Frequent<br />\nalso are references to the supposed threat that such research poses<br />\nto \"the harmonious existence of<br />\nall people.\"<br />\nA companion belief appears to<br />\nbe that maintaining a discreet<br />\nsilence does no harm, even when<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\nthe IQ differences are real. This<br />\nbelief would help to explain why<br />\neditors of respected scientific<br />\njournals have sometimes declined to publish our research,<br />\ndespite its scientific value,<br />\nbecause of \"considerations on<br />\nhow a multi-ethnic and multiracial society can survive<br />\nthat. . . may well overweigh the<br />\nclaims of social science.\" The<br />\nimpression is created that some<br />\ninformation and ideas are<br />\ndangerous, even in a democracy,<br />\nand that the welfare of blacks and<br />\nsociety as a whole is enhanced by<br />\nsuppressing them.<br />\nBut is this true? Might not it be<br />\nunwise in the long run to enforce<br />\na myth that more and more people are realizing is false? Might<br />\nnot it be unethical to deny blacks<br />\nand whites knowledge that might<br />\nallow them to make more informed decisions and fashion more effective social policy? Denying the<br />\nreality of IQ differences does<br />\nnothing to blunt their relentless<br />\nimpact on performance in school,<br />\nat work, and in other areas of<br />\nsocial life.<br />\nAnd does it really facilitate<br />\n\"the harmonious existence of all<br />\npeople\" when the Left accuses<br />\nthe American public of lack of<br />\ncompassion, the Right accuses<br />\nblacks of lack of effort, and<br />\nblacks accuse whites of<br />\nsystematic oppression, all<br />\npresumably out of concern over<br />\ndifferences in life outcomes<br />\nwhich actually may be traced in<br />\nlarge part to differences in IQ?<br />\nNo one who has grappled<br />\nhonestly with the unsettling<br />\ndilemmas posed by stubborn<br />\ngroup differences in intelligence<br />\npretends that discussing them is<br />\neasy, that our moral choices are<br />\nclear, or that knaves and fools of<br />\nall races won't complicate our efforts to cope effectively and<br />\nhumanely with them.

So<br />\nwhen we leave the humanitarian<br />\npractice completely out of our<br />\nforeign policy, when we use a<br />\nsmaller country such as Cambodia for an imagined larger geopolitical purpose without stopping<br />\nto consider the potential consequences to the Cambodian people, we debase our tradition.\u2014<br />\nInsisting that we are a moral<br />\nnation., Schonberg asserted that<br />\nits not logical to justify a<br />\nmisguided policy by saying that<br />\nthe Russians are immoral.<br />\n\"Democracy by its nature must<br />\nbear the disadvantage of being<br />\njudged differently.

He lamented the<br />\nvast number of homeless people<br />\nin New York City. and criticized<br />\nMayor Edward Koch, who, he<br />\nsaid, does not ask about the consequences for the people who will<br />\nno longer be able to afford to live<br />\nin these \"luxury pyramids\u2022' that<br />\nare being established, and that<br />\nwill no longer be able tO afford<br />\nthe prices in the trendy shops that<br />\nare replacing the neighborhood<br />\nstores. \"Where will all these people go\u2014is anyone asking, does<br />\nanyone care? Are not these people just as much the lifeblood of<br />\nany city as are the men who put<br />\nbuildings in the clouds but cannot<br />\nseem . to see the people in the<br />\nstreets below.\u2014 Schonberg cited<br />\nthe crises as being the fact that<br />\nenough houses are not being built<br />\nfor people that they can afford\u2014<br />\n\"for people that are members of<br />\nthe working class,\u2014 he stressed,<br />\nmaintaining that only some are on<br />\nwelfare and that others are working or want to work.<br />\n\"It seems to me that these are<br />\nthe kind of is,sues that an<br />\nenergetic press, an energetic<br />\nmedia ought to be examining all<br />\nover the country,\u2014 Schonberg<br />\ndeclared. \"Instead we have a<br />\nrather tame and flabby press in<br />\nAmerica.

I<br />\nthough Boston's Third Stage (or<br />\nSpringsteen's Live, or the Top<br />\nGun soundtrack) was the best<br />\nalbum of the year.Therefore, I'll declare my subjectivity up front, and call the<br />\nfollowing list \"My Ten Favorite<br />\nRecords of 1986.\"<br />\nAll in all, it's been a pretty<br />\ngood year for music. The Top 40<br />\nwas full of the usual dross, with<br />\na few notable exceptions, but look<br />\non the bright sidecWham! broke<br />\nup, Peter Gabriel had his first<br />\nmegahit, and Motley Crue didn't<br />\nrelease a new album.<br />\nAnd there were enough appealing LPs released to ensure plenty of runners-up for this list, including Depeche Mode's Black<br />\nCelebration, Anna Domino's<br />\nself-titled album, Stutter by<br />\nJames, and Robyn Hitchcock's<br />\nElement of Light. But let's get<br />\nright to the ten that were my tops<br />\nin pops.<br />\n1. The Woodentops, Giant(Columbia). This young British band<br />\ndoesn't need to fake exuberance,<br />\nsincerity and energy; they've got<br />\nthem in spades. That's what<br />\nmakes listening to Giant such a<br />\njoyful experience. From the<br />\nlightning-fast licks of \"Love<br />\nTrain\" to the gentle groove of<br />\n\"Good Thing,\" Giant is one<br />\nhugely entertaining record.<br />\n2. The Woodentops, Well Well<br />\nWe// (Upside). This compilation<br />\n<br />\n7. The Housemartins, London 0<br />\nHull 4(Elektra). These tour Brits<br />\narc endearing musical Marxists,<br />\nsetting socially-aware lyrics to the<br />\ncatchiest of pop tunes. Songs like<br />\nHappy Hour\" and \"Sheep\" are<br />\nnonstop, upbeat fun, while the<br />\nmore reflective \"Think For A<br />\nMinute- and the gospel-tinged<br />\n\"I'll Be Your Shelter\" show the<br />\nband's more sober side.<br />\n8. The Pretenders, Get Close<br />\n(Sire). Chrissic Hynde has come<br />\na long, long way since the cool<br />\nrebel stance of her \"Precious\"<br />\ndays\u2014she's now the only original<br />\nPretender, a wife and mother,<br />\nand definitely grown-up. Gel<br />\nClose is a refreshingly mature<br />\nrock album, free of gimmicks and<br />\nfrills, full of solid songwriting<br />\nand energetic playing.<br />\n<br />\nE M\u2022<br />\nof the 'Tops' early singles doesn't<br />\nhave Giant's slick and polished<br />\nsound. It's closer in spirit to their<br />\nfast-and-furious live shows. And<br />\nthere's more variety among the<br />\nsongs here\u2014\"Steady Steady\" is<br />\na masterpiece of cathartic angst,<br />\n\"Do It Anyway- is a modern<br />\nrockabilly romp, and the title<br />\ntrack flirts with but never falls into complete musical anarchy.<br />\n3. Throwing Muses, Throwing<br />\nMuses (4AD import). Artful<br />\nlyrics, nightmare visions,<br />\nchallenging rhythms. This<br />\nBoston-based band establishes a<br />\npowerful presence with their<br />\ndebut LP, thanks largely to<br />\nKristin Hersh's dynamic vocals.<br />\nUnpredictable, irresistible rock.<br />\n4. R.E.M., Wes Rich Pageant<br />\n<br />\n(I.R.S.). Hooking up with John<br />\nCougar Mellencamp's producer,<br />\nDon Gehman, was a potentially<br />\nrisky move for R.E.M. Would<br />\nLifes Rich Pageant be another sad<br />\nsellout to A.O.R. radio?<br />\nThankfully, no; big guitar solos<br />\nand tunes about sex, beer, and<br />\nrockin all night are not R.E.M.'s<br />\nstyle. Michael Stipe's thoughtful<br />\nlyrics are actually understandable<br />\nand the songs have more hooks,<br />\nbut those are changes for the<br />\nbetter.<br />\n5. Peter Gabriel, So (Geffen).<br />\n\"Sledgehammer\" is pure excitement, bouncy, funky, and 1986's<br />\nbest single by far. But there's so<br />\nmuch more to So. Kate Bush adds<br />\nan angelic vocal to \"Don't Give<br />\nUp,- one of the year's most stirring musical moments; \"In Your<br />\n<br />\nEyes- draws on African pop for<br />\ninspiration, and \"Big Time\" proves that Pete's still got a good<br />\nsense of humor (he did, after all,<br />\ndress up like a flower when he<br />\nwas in Genesis). A triumph.<br />\n<br />\n6. The Fall, Bend Sinister (Beggars Banquet import). Manchester's fabulous Fall is perhaps<br />\nthe most consistently good band<br />\nin the U.K. Every year they<br />\nrelease a new record, and every<br />\nyear it's a gem. Mark E. and Brix<br />\nSmith lead the Fall through ten<br />\ntracks, covering grunge-guitar<br />\ngarage rock (\"Mr. Pharmacist\"),<br />\nuncharacteristically perky pop<br />\n(\"Shoulder Pads\"), and much<br />\nmore.

I<br />\nthought his performance would<br />\nbe unbearably prissy. This was<br />\nnot the case at all, though his<br />\nstrongpoint is most definitely<br />\nlyricism. Isserlis conjured up a<br />\nfull range of emotions and stretched the dynamic range of gut<br />\nstrings in a most breathtaking<br />\nway. However, his sound was<br />\nfrequently lost in musical conversation with his accompanist Peter<br />\nEvans. This is not Evans' fault\u2014<br />\nhe played brilliantly and considerately. Isserlis' tone from<br />\nthose strings is gorgeous, and I<br />\n<br />\nthink Isserlis would be a big hit throughout all the dances Isserlis<br />\nin recordings. In the studio, was too smooth.

Dutton, Inc.<br />\n305<br />\npp.<br />\nJoyce Carol Oates has been<br />\nwriting short stories for many<br />\nyears and firmly established an<br />\noriginal style that has come to be<br />\nexpected by readers and critics<br />\nalike. Her new book, Raven 's<br />\nWing, is no exception. This book<br />\nis a compilation of nineteen<br />\nstories, most of which have<br />\nalready appeared in respected<br />\nliterary journals. Oates is already<br />\nconsidered a master of the short<br />\nstory and anything she writes is<br />\nusually highly acclaimed.<br />\nHowever, a few of the stories in<br />\nthe collection do not measure up<br />\nto her reputation when compared<br />\nwith others in the book.<br />\nAs in other collections, each of<br />\nthe stories in Raven's Wing contains its own little world, and<br />\nOates focuses on the characters<br />\nrather than the plot; each story is<br />\nmerely a section of the<br />\ncharacters' lives. Oates is<br />\nprimarily concerned with the<br />\nbehavior of the characters. If one<br />\nhad to describe her style and subjects<br />\nin<br />\none<br />\nword,<br />\n\"psychological\" fits perfectly.<br />\nThe subject matters of thg<br />\nstories are very unusual, but total-<br />\n<br />\nly believable. One is constantly<br />\namazed at the author's varied<br />\nchoice of subjects, and wonders<br />\nhow she could think up such odd<br />\nsituations. In addition, the stories<br />\ntend to be extremely disturbing.<br />\nIn \"The Jesuit,\" a young professor becomes obsessed with the<br />\nnotion that one of her colleagues,<br />\na Jesuit priest, hates her without<br />\nreason. \"Happy\" is a four-page<br />\nstory that illustrates the fierce<br />\nneed some people feel to appear<br />\nhappy. The tone is insistent, and<br />\nthrough the character's desperate<br />\nand repititious declarations that<br />\nthey are indeed happy, one sees<br />\nthat they are not at all. In \"Little<br />\nWife,\" a young boy is unable to<br />\ncome to terms with the fact that<br />\nhis father and his drinking buddies are keeping a teenager in<br />\ntheir house as a \"willing prostitute.\" The men begin viciously to abuse the girl, and without<br />\nthe boy's help she would probably die.<br />\nSymbols play a crucial part in<br />\nOates' stories. For example, in<br />\n\"Seasons,\" two adopted kittens<br />\nbecome a representation of their<br />\nowners. Oates doesn't say this<br />\noutright, but the reader is able to<br />\nsee an underlying connection between the kittens and the man and<br />\nwoman throughout the story.<br />\nOats is a supreme example of an<br />\nauthor who \"shows\" rather than<br />\n\"tells\" the characters' feelings<br />\n<br />\nand situations.<br />\nThe problem with short story<br />\ncollections is that one tends to<br />\nread them all at once as if it were<br />\na novel. Oates' stories should be<br />\nread independently because each<br />\nstory is so compelling in its<br />\nsociological reflections of<br />\nAmerican life. But if they are<br />\nread together, the reader can pick<br />\nout the weaker stories from the<br />\nstronger ones.

Other eye<br />\ndiseases hinder the ability of the<br />\nphotoreceptor cells to absorb<br />\nlight, or kills the cells, causing<br />\nblindness. Dr. Ruben Adler,<br />\nassociate professor of ophthalmology and neurosciences, and his<br />\nteam of colleagues at the Wilmer<br />\nEye Institute of the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine are in<br />\nthe process of studying and \"attempting to understand these<br />\nlight-sensitive photoreceptor<br />\ncells, whose mysteries hide the<br />\ncures for many eye diseases.<br />\nTo study these cells, Dr. Adler<br />\nhas devised a method that has<br />\ngreatly increased our chances of<br />\nunderstanding the photoreceptor<br />\ncells. He first carefully dissects<br />\nan 8-day old chick embryo to<br />\nremove the retina. He then treats<br />\nthis undeveloped tissue with enzymes to loosen them up, thus<br />\ncreating a suspension of isolated<br />\nsingle cells. These cells are then<br />\ntreated with two groups of<br />\nchemicals: one that keeps them<br />\nalive, and another that settles the<br />\ncells, causing them to individually stick to the bottom of a dish.<br />\nThe fact that these cells are<br />\nisolated allows Dr. Adler to pick<br />\nout individual cells to observe and<br />\nstudy. This sometimes involves<br />\nthe use of a video camera that<br />\ncaptures the growth and development of the cell on videotape for<br />\nothers to observe. From studying<br />\nthe growth of individual photoreceptor cells, Dr. Adler is trying to find out what these cells<br />\nneed in order to stay alive and<br />\nfunction, the pathological agents<br />\n<br />\nthat<br />\nnormal genes can cause their<br />\ndegeneration.<br />\nTo understand the factors that<br />\nkeep the photoreceptor cells alive<br />\nand functioning, different conditions must be considered. First,<br />\nDr. Adler observes the effects<br />\ndifferent substances that might<br />\ncome into contact with these cells<br />\nhave on the individual cells.<br />\nThen, knowing that within the<br />\nretina photoreceptor cells are in<br />\ncontact with many other different<br />\ntypes of cells (neurons, glial) he<br />\ntries to identify the contributions<br />\nthat these various cells have on<br />\nthe well-being of the photoreceptor cells. The goal of the study is<br />\nto identify the nutrients necessary<br />\nfor keeping the photoreceptor<br />\ncells healthy.<br />\nFinding pathological agents<br />\nthat kill these cells involves the<br />\nsame method of experimentation<br />\nin finding which chemicals or<br />\nsubstances cause harm to the<br />\ncells.

The past idea that<br />\nphotoreceptor cells can not be<br />\ngrown individually for observation has been refuted by Adler.<br />\nAlso, Adler has found several<br />\nnutrients that seem essential for<br />\npreserving photoreceptor cell life.<br />\nLike all research projects, problems have been encountered.<br />\nThe proper method of growing<br />\nthe photoreceptor cells took ten<br />\nyears to discover, one of the main<br />\n<br />\ndifficulties involved getting rid of<br />\nthe many glial cells (other cells<br />\npresent on the retina) that tended<br />\nto dominate cultures. It was also<br />\nnecessary to study the cells with<br />\nmany different methods to demonstrate their identity and to compare the properties of cultured<br />\nphotoreceptors with the properties of the same cells in the intact<br />\nanima).<br />\nThe fact that the approach of<br />\nisolating certain cells for individual study has proved his-<br />\n<br />\ntorically successful in finding the<br />\ncauses of other diseases gives<br />\nAdler reason to feel his research<br />\nis trying to solve a problem in the<br />\nproper way.

Brian Corder,<br />\nM.D., Ph.D., Michael Graham,<br />\nM.D.,, Brigid Leventhal, M.D.,<br />\nand Lewis Strauss, M.D. are five<br />\nphysician-scientists who have<br />\ndedicated their lives to the study<br />\nand treatment of pediatric<br />\noncology.<br />\nThese doctors are part of the<br />\nnew breed of medical practitioners who are not only involved in the treatment and diagnosis<br />\nof cancer, but are also part of the<br />\nresearch and investigation end of<br />\nthe spectrum; ergo the name<br />\nphysician-scientist. Although<br />\nconventional means are still used<br />\nto treat patients, these doctors are<br />\nunhappy with current therapies,<br />\ndrugs, and treatments because of<br />\nthe pain, time and money involved with them. Although cancer in<br />\nanyone is tragic, it is particularly heartrending and unfair to see<br />\n<br />\nit strike a child. Because of this<br />\nfact, these doctors are trying to<br />\nimprove today's therapies by<br />\nmaking them shorter and less<br />\ntraumatic for the kids and thus<br />\nletting them get on with their<br />\nlives.<br />\nEach physician carries on<br />\nresearch in addition to his or her<br />\ntreatment of patients. Dr. Corder<br />\nis currently exploring the effects<br />\nthat Cisplatin, a soluble derivative<br />\nof the element platinum, has on<br />\nsolid tumors. This drug has been<br />\nsuccessful in the treatment of<br />\ngerm cell tumors, but in some<br />\ncases has side effects that can<br />\ncause kidney and hearing problems. Corder has been trying to<br />\nminimize the toxicity of the drug<br />\nwhile maintaining its effectiveness.<br />\nPlatinum has also been found to<br />\nbe effective in the treatment of<br />\nbrain tumors, which account for<br />\none third of all tumors in<br />\nchildren. Because brain tumors in<br />\nchildren are often inoperable, and<br />\n, the brain is highly sensitive to<br />\n<br />\nradiation treatments, a new approach has been sought after.<br />\nCorder, along with Leventhal and<br />\nStrauss have been working with<br />\ndrugs that are combinations<br />\nwhich include platinum. Platinum<br />\nis an element that can cross the<br />\nbrain-blood barrier that exists and<br />\ndrugs made with it have been effective in shrinking pediatric<br />\nbrain tumors and thus postponing<br />\npossible radiation or surgery.<br />\nDr. Graham is currently studying how certain drugs effect<br />\nleukemia in children. One in particular is Methtrexate, which has<br />\nbeen proven to be an integral part<br />\nof a patient's therapy. Today,<br />\nwith drugs like this one, they expect to cure the \"average\" patient where 10 or 12 years ago<br />\nthey could not have. But still<br />\nthese doctors are not satisfied.<br />\nThey want to make the treatment<br />\nshorter, create a pill form of the<br />\ndrug to take away needless shots,<br />\nand IV's, and simply make it as<br />\neasy as possible on the kids, some<br />\nof whom are too young to even<br />\n<br />\nunderstand what is happening.<br />\nAlthough 901of leukemia partients can be cured, the possibility of remission remains. One<br />\ntreatment then used is a bone<br />\nmarrow transplant. Dr. Civin,<br />\nalong with Dr. Strauss. is studying ways to make this treatment<br />\nmore effective in leukemia pa.<br />\ntients. They are observing the<br />\ngrowth processes of the stem cells<br />\nin the marrow and how cancer<br />\ncausing genes called oncogenes,<br />\ngive rise to tumors. They are also<br />\nworking on ways to reduce the<br />\npossibility of rejection by the<br />\ntransplant of the body. In a<br />\ntransplant immune cells can be<br />\nmoved along with the stem cells,<br />\nbut now an antibody has been<br />\ndeveloped to separate the<br />\nnecessary stem cells and<br />\ntransplant them only.<br />\nThe team method employed<br />\ndown at the center does not include just these 5 doctors. There<br />\nare radiologists. neurosurgeons,<br />\nsocial workes, child life workers,<br />\npsychiatrists, and others who are<br />\n<br />\na part of it. Cancer in children<br />\ncauses incredible problems emotionally as well as financially in<br />\nboth the patient and the family.<br />\nThese people realize that their patients are still developing, as well<br />\nas emotionally,and have special<br />\nproblems. Through financial<br />\nassistance from the Children's<br />\nCancer Foundation cheery, pleasant playrooms, ward, and parent<br />\nrooms have been added to ease<br />\nsome of the pain. A new \"state<br />\nof the art\" out-patient center is<br />\nalso being planned.<br />\nAlthough kids can be \"tough as<br />\nheck.\" special care and attention<br />\nare necessary in the treatment of<br />\ncancer in children.

Al-Shabkhoun<br />\nOn Tuesday November 25, the<br />\nanniversary of Lebanese Independence, Yousseff Siyyah,<br />\npress attache of the Lebanese Embassy, and Clovis Maksoud, ambassador of the League of Arab<br />\nStates, spoke to an ample crowd<br />\non the state of Lebanon in the<br />\nClipper Room at 6:00 p.m.<br />\nThe evenings events started<br />\nwith the symbolic planting of a<br />\ncedar at Hopkins. The cedar,<br />\nwhich is depicted on the Lebanese<br />\nflag, was mentioned by Siyyah,<br />\nwho stated, \"Today we offer with<br />\npride and love a symbol that the<br />\nBible talks about. We offer the<br />\nImmortal Cedar of Lebanon.\"<br />\nSiyyah's speech was riddled<br />\nwith despair, while maintaining a<br />\nhopeful tone.<br />\n\"The Lebanese,\" stated<br />\nSiyyah, \"still insist on celebrating<br />\ntheir independence day, despite<br />\nall the heartache and pain.<br />\nLebanon has had more invading<br />\narmies than any other country in<br /><br />\nthe world.<br />\n\"To live in Lebanon,\" asserted<br />\nSiyyah, \"is to live with violence<br />\nwhile resisting the horrors of a<br />\nwar that is not ours but is fought<br />\non our soil.\"<br />\nAccording to Siyyah, a great<br />\nasset to the Lebanese people is<br />\nthat \"each Lebanese is fiercely<br />\ndevoted to life. The Lebanese<br />\ndecided long ago to keep their<br />\ncountry from dying.\"<br />\nSiyyay also stressed the importance of Lebanon. \"No city in the<br />\nMiddle East is like Lebanon.<br />\nLebanon will always be a necesity,\" noting that Lebanon has been<br />\na \"liason between the Arab and<br />\noutside world\" and that it is the<br />\n\"cultural nerve center\" of the<br />\nMiddle East.<br />\nSiyyah also pleaded for the<br />\ndeparture of unwanted foreign<br />\ntroops from Lebanon. \"To give<br />\na chance for Lebanon to resolve<br />\nits domestic disputes, the immediate withdrawal of all unwanted foreign armies is<br />\nimperative.\"<br /><br />\nRemebering the loss of<br />\nAmerican lives in Lebanon,<br />\nSiyyah reflected, \"Lebanon remains in gratitude to the U.S. for<br />\nthe sacrifices that it has made. We<br />\nfelt the U.S. deaths in Lebanon<br />\nas our own, and will continue to<br />\nfoster strong relations with this<br />\ngreat country.\"<br />\nEnding his speech, Siyyah<br />\nstated, \"We have paid the high<br />\nprice of war. There is no need for<br />\nus to pay for peace,\" before adding a final plea, \"Give us peace,<br />\nand we shall once more astound<br />\nthe whole world.\"<br />\nMaksoud next took the podium<br />\nand opened by stating, \"A symbolic gesture made today comes<br />\non the eve of a new era. Perhaps<br />\na new era in U.S.-Lebanese relations will start with the announcement that shoddy deals were<br />\nmade by Israel with Iran.\"<br />\nMaksoud hoped that this would<br />\n\"open the hearts and minds of the<br />\nAmerican people in response to<br />\nContinued on Page 2<br /><br />\nA Al-Shabkhoun<br /><br />\nClovis Maksoud, the Ambassador of the League of Arab States, who<br />\nvisited Hopkins to help celebrate Lebanese Independence Day.<br /><br />\nMandela, Hooks Scheduled for King Lecture<br />\nby Geir Magnusson<br />\nWinnie Mandela has accepted<br />\nan invitation to speak at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical Institution birthday tribute to Martin Luther<br />\nKing, Jr. Also speaking will be<br />\nBenjamin Hooks, the executive<br />\ndirector of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).<br />\nMandela is the wife of Nelson<br />\nMandela, the imprisoned leader<br />\nof the outlawed African National<br />\nCongress.

Rham,<br />\nthe Deputy Chief of Indian Mission in Washington, D.C., came<br />\nto Homewood to speak about India's present foreign policy<br />\ntoward South Africa, both the<br />\npresent pro-apartheid Botha administration and the African National Congress. Sponsored by<br />\nthe Indian Students Association<br />\nand co-sponsored by the International Studies Fund and<br />\nChaplain's Office of Johns<br />\nHopkins, the lecture was held in<br />\nthe Multi-Purpose Room in AMR<br />\nI at 8:00 pm.<br />\nIntroduced by Deepti Kharod,<br />\nthe president of the Indian<br />\nStudents Association, Rham<br />\nbegan by giving what he called \"a<br />\nhistorical perspective of what is<br />\nbehind the rationale of Indian<br />\npolicy toward South Africa.\"<br />\nRham maintained that South<br />\nAfrica was \"the laboratory for<br />\nthe 'Indian experiment,\u2014 that is,<br />\nthe philosophy of using nonviolent means for achieving<br />\npolitical ends, \"[which] was<br />\nevolved, conceived, born, and<br />\nperfected in South Africa.\"<br />\nHe continued by relating some<br />\nof Gandhi's experiences in South<br />\nAfrica, and how they shaped later<br />\nIndian foreign policy.

Repeatedly bringing up the injustices of apartheid<br />\nSouth Africa, Rham related India's present policy toward South<br />\nAfrica, that is the policy of no<br />\npolitical or economic relations<br />\nwith the Botha administration. He<br />\nurged that the countries of the<br />\nworld \"bring upon South Africa<br />\nall the pressure they can possibly<br />\nbear.\"<br />\nAfter the lecture, Rham field-<br /><br />\ned numerous questions from the<br />\naudience.

This led me<br />\nto conclude that many here want<br />\nto consider the University a community, and I simply took note of<br />\nwhat I saw as a commendable effort on the part of some people affiliated with the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity (I understand that Dr.<br />\nGordon is not to be included in<br />\nthat category). On the other hand,<br />\nI wonder how Dr. Gordon can<br />\nassume that my argument refers<br />\nto<br />\n\"black<br />\nand<br />\nwhite<br />\nundergraduate.\" This assumption<br />\nis totally unfounded.<br />\n2)I am not against the publication of a review of Dr. Gordon's<br />\nand Dr. Gottfredson's work or of<br />\nany work, good or bad. The<br />\nquality of the review, however,is<br />\nimportant, and the outcome of<br />\nMr. Gergyes' effort would have<br />\nbeen a lot better had he tried to<br />\npresent this controversial study in<br />\na more impartial way. This is<br />\nwhy I attacked him and not Dr.<br />\nGordon and Dr. Gottfredson.<br />\nThat the latter are faculty<br />\nmembers and the former a student<br />\ndid not at all influence my action.<br />\nFor Dr. Gordon, however, I<br />\nmerely \"tried to isolate and intimidate [Mr. Gergyes] in a manner not likely to get far if tried<br />\nwith faculty.\" This shows that he<br />\ndid not understand the cause and<br />\npurpose of my letter which I<br />\nmade a point to put in clear and<br />\nsimple terms.<br />\n3) The News-Letter published<br />\non November 21 a letter by a<br />\nmember of the Black Student<br />\nUnion (BSU) who asserts that<br />\nMr. Gergyes himself recently<br />\nsent an apologetic note to the<br />\nBSU about his articles and to<br />\nclarify his stance on the matter.<br />\nThis fact reinforces my claim<br />\nmaking it a lot less ridiculous than<br />\nDr. Gordon thinks and wants<br />\nothers to believe. Why would the<br />\nScience Editor send a written note<br />\nof apology to the BSU if he felt<br />\nor knew that he had done such \"a<br />\ngood job\" as Dr. Gordon<br />\npretends?<br />\nI would like to suggest that Mr.<br />\nGergyes' letter to the BSU be<br />\npublished by the News-Letter<br />\nsince through his articles he insulted (perhaps unintentionally)<br />\nnot only members of the BSU,<br />\nbut also blacks outside that<br />\norganization,<br />\nnon-blacks,<br />\nundergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents. All deserve an apology.<br />\nEric Tevoedjre<br /><br />\nThe writer is in error. On October 24, Joe Gergyes wrote a<br />\nprivate letter to members of the<br />\nBlack Student Union thanking<br />\nthem for reading and reviewing<br />\nhis recent article on research being conducted on group differences in IQ. Gergyes expressed his concern about allegations<br />\nofsensationalism and bigotry but<br />\nwelcomed members ofthe B.S. U.<br />\nto express their opinions on the<br />\nsubject on these pages. No<br />\napology was made whatsoever.<br /><br />\nChasing French Ducks<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nA few thoughts on reading<br />\nPresident Muller's interview in<br />\nlast week's News-Letter.<br />\nOn the occupation of Garland<br />\nHall he noted that only verbal<br />\npersuasion would have been effective. The \"would\" needs<br />\nmore emphasis; for, despite the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica's willingness to negotiate,<br />\nDr. Muller refused all meetings<br />\nat the time. His prerogative, of<br />\ncourse, but it makes talk of \"verbal persuasion\" after the fact a<br />\nlittle disingenuous.<br />\nOn his claim that the Trustees<br />\nwere unanimous in their refusal<br />\nto totally divest. While the<br />\nTrustees' statement<br />\nwas<br />\nunanimously adopted at the<br />\nOct.25th meeting, it is clearly<br />\nstated in that document that it is<br />\n\"the judgement of the prevailing<br />\nmajority of the Board of<br /><br />\nTrustees\" that total divestment<br />\n\"would not represent a prudent<br />\ncourse of action.\" Obviously in<br />\na split decision the issue of conflict of interest is of importance.<br />\nFinally, the question of who is<br />\nout chasing French ducks will be<br />\ndecided in the courts. Perhaps<br />\nDr.Muller is indeed correct in his<br />\nassessment that no impropriety<br />\noccurs when a member, having<br />\ndutifully declared her/himself in<br />\nconflict of interest then proceeds<br />\nto argue and vote for those interests. The outcome will be<br />\neducational for many.<br />\nPhilip Murphy<br />\nP.S. Speaking of education, a<br />\nnumber of correspondents in the<br />\nletter columns of the last two<br />\nissues of the News-Letter referred<br />\nto Nelson Mandela as an \"avowed communist.\" According to<br />\nWebster's, that means he is a selfdeclared communist. I had always<br />\nbeen impressed by his eloquent<br /><br />\nexplanation during the Treason<br />\nTrials of why as a parliamentarian his goals are different from<br />\nthose of a communist.

Oil<br />\ncompany stocks have fallen in recent years. Any moral commentary the Trustees make in announcing a partial divestment at this<br />\nmeeting will be as bogus and<br />\ntransparent as the JHU Office of<br />\nInformation Service's superhyped publicity over the invitation to Winnie Mandela to speak<br />\nat Hopkins in January.(Why not<br />\ninvite Nelson?)<br />\nAs usual, the Coalition for a<br />\nFree South Africa will be pointing out to these guys how insufficient their corporate philosophy<br />\nis in dealing with moral issues.<br />\nAnd as usual, we'll have new<br />\ntricks up our sleeve for the noon<br />\nmeeting on Monday at Garland.<br />\nJoin us there!<br />\nFor the Steering Committee of<br />\nthe Coalition,<br /><br />\njudice, discrimination, and just<br />\nblatant ill-regard towards the<br />\nspecial problems of Blacks or any<br />\nother minority group, for that<br />\nmatter.

Those points were well<br />\ntaken. But then you went on to<br />\nexpress other feelings and concerns that lead me to believe that<br />\nyou are quite confused as to what<br />\npoint Mr. Faidley was making in<br />\nhis letter, \"Wipe Your Palms.\"<br />\nAs I interpreted it, Mr.<br />\nFaidley's letter was not condemning the White Heterosexual<br />\nMale or any one else for that matter. He was basically making the<br />\nstatement, \"We've come a long<br />\nway, and it hasn't been easy.\"<br />\nRegardless of how oppressed you<br />\nthink you are (and I trust you<br />\nweren't serious), you have not<br />\nhad to tolerate any of the pre-<br /><br />\nAs a very concerned member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, I'm sure<br />\nthat I was not the only one to find<br />\nreading last week's editorial<br />\npages a draining experience; and<br />\nas a member of the Coalition, I<br />\nfound it even more so. Since the<br />\nstart of this year, the Coalition<br />\nhas come under such massive attack from the community that we<br />\nrepeatedly find ourselves spending an unprecedented amount of<br />\ntime and energy defending<br />\neverything from our goals to our<br />\norganization to our tactics. Again<br />\nand again we are accused of the<br />\nsame things in editorial letters:<br />\nthat the majority of blacks in S.<br />\nAfrica do not approve of sanctions, that Divestment by foreign<br />\ninvestors will only hurt the<br />\nblacks, that our tactics are<br />\ncounter-productive<br />\nand/or<br />\nalienating, that Divestment can do<br />\nno good in S. Africa but will in-<br /><br />\nstead damage this University, and<br />\nof course, that it's none of our<br />\nbusiness what this University<br />\ndoes with its money.<br />\nI took it as an indication that<br />\nthese criticisms needed no further<br />\nrepetition when last week I inserted a clean piece of paper in<br />\nmy typewriter before I even read<br />\nthe editorial letters. After reading<br />\nthem, I am reassured that I was<br />\nnot over-reacting. Furthermore,<br />\ndespite my vow that I would not<br />\nperpetuate this cycle and defend<br />\nthe Coalition once again, I am<br />\nstill tempted to do so. I restrain<br />\nmyself because I am aware that<br />\nthe Coalition has more than adequately defended itself against all<br />\nof these charges more than once.<br />\nI write this letter only to ask if our<br />\nopponents have been paying any<br />\nattention whatsoever to our<br />\nresponses. Being continually<br />\nforced to justify the same actions<br />\nleads me to believe that we are<br />\nfighting a losing battle against individuals who are in no way<br />\nserious about resolving the issues<br />\nthey raise, but who have instead<br />\nclosed their minds to any information that might conflict<br />\nwith their own and are now resorting to mere harassment.<br />\nThis same attitude is evident in<br />\nthose who profess to champion<br />\nour goals but condemn our tactics. The Coalition welcomes<br />\nanyone who feels they have found<br />\na way to further the antiApartheid cause and to help<br />\nblacks in S. Africa achieve the<br />\nrights and privileges they<br />\ndeserve, to do so. The tactical<br />\nquestion should not be at the<br />\nforefront of this movement. Not<br />\nonly are we open to all suggestions made within our group and<br />\nto members of our own group, we<br />\nwould fully endorse any antiApartheid movement separate<br />\nfrom our own on this campus.<br />\nUltimately, we realize as many of<br />\nour opponents do not seem to,<br />\nthat the end is the most important<br />\naspect of any move for change<br />\nand that the means should be only secondary.<br />\nIt seems that at this stage most<br />\narguments for and against divestment, and for and against the<br />\nCoalition, have been fully explored in these editorial pages.<br />\nFurther attacks along the same<br />\nlines only compel the Coalition to<br />\nagain defend itself and indicate<br />\nthat someone is deliberately not<br />\nlistening. It is apparent now that<br />\nthe editorial shouting match of<br />\nthis semester is growing increasingly futile. Action is the only<br />\nway that the S. African racist<br />\nregime will fall and that the<br />\nsenseless suffering there will end.<br />\nI urge anyone who feels in deep<br />\ndisagreement with the Coalition<br />\non a tactical basis alone to take<br />\nthis to heart and initiate any action that they believe will do more<br />\ngood for S.

Much more will be written on<br />\nthis topic, as the case will soon<br />\nbe pending in the Baltimore<br />\ncourts. In the last News-Letter,<br />\nMuller described concerns about<br />\nconflicts of interest and the corporate priorities of our Board of<br />\nTrustees as \"balderdash\" and<br />\ncalled the whole issue \"a<br />\ncanard.\" He went on to say that<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica doesn't understand conflicts of interest, since \"The conflict arises when interests are not<br />\ndisclosed.\" According to the article, \"Muller said that the<br />\nassociation of certain Trustees to<br />\ncorporations like Maryland National Bank is well known, even<br />\nto the Coalition, and therefore, a<br />\nconflict of interest does not<br />\nexist.\"<br />\nWe were quite surprised that so<br />\nmuch nonsense appeared in just<br />\none interview, so we asked<br />\nMuller in writing if in fact all<br />\nthese quotes were valid. Apparently so . . .<br />\nFirst, Muller is way off the<br />\nmark on the law. Simply<br />\nacknowledging conflict of interest<br />\ndoes not allow someone to go<br />\nahead and engage in a vote. This<br />\ncontradicts Hopkins' own policy<br />\nstatement, as well as Maryland<br />\nstate law.<br />\nSecond, Muller somehow<br />\nbelieves that the Coalition already<br />\nknows all the conflicts of interest<br />\nof Trustees, so it was not important for them to be acknowledged. Not so. If we knew them all<br />\nalready, we wouldn't be spending<br />\nso much time researching the<br />\nTrustees in various Who's Who<br />\nbooks trying to match names to<br />\ncorporations.<br />\nWhile we're on the topic, did<br />\nanyone at Hopkins know that<br />\nSteven Muller himself is on the<br />\nBoard of Directors of a company<br />\nthat until June had a South<br />\nAfrican direct operation? While<br />\norganizing the Sullivan Principles<br />\npartial divestment in September,<br />\n1985 Muller should have disclosed his own conflict of interest on<br />\nSouth Africa investments.<br />\nAgain from the article,<br />\n\"Muller also said that the Coalition was 'counting Trustees<br />\nEmeritus' among those who supposedly have ties to Maryland<br />\nNational.\" That's balderdash.<br />\nDoesn't Muller know that there<br />\nare no Hopkins Trustees Emeritus<br />\non the Board of Directors of<br />\nMaryland National? There are<br />\nseven Maryland National directors on Hopkins' regular Board of<br />\nTrustees, including four on the<br />\nInvestment Committee.<br />\nMuller's final point on divestment in the interview was that the<br />\nOctober 27 decision was<br />\nunanimous. Well, by tradition, all<br />\ndecisions of the Hopkins Board of<br />\nTrustees are unanimous. Had as<br />\nmany as two dozen of the<br />\nTrustees with conflicts of interest<br />\nabstained from discussion and<br />\nvoting on the issue, it is<br />\nreasonable to suspect that the<br />\nboard might have unanimously<br />\ndecided on the proposal they were<br />\nsupposed to consider\u2014i.e. total<br />\ndivestment.<br />\nThat's a critique of all of<br />\nMuller's points on conflicts of interest and divestment. As to<br /><br />\nMuller's comment that \"It would<br />\nhave been very difficult to try to<br />\nevict the Coalition (during our occupation of 'Mandela Hall') by<br />\nany means other than verbal persuasion,\" he left out the fact that<br />\nrepeated requests by the Coalition<br />\nfor a verbal discussion with<br />\nMuller during the occupation<br />\nwere denied.<br />\nIn any campaign like the struggle for divestment, tempers will<br />\nflare and people will misspeak.<br />\nThe Coalition is a very selfcritical group and openly addresses its own failings. We know<br />\nthat Steven Muller will, in the<br />\nsame spirit, either retract or defend the positions he took in the<br />\nNews-Letter interview.<br />\nFor the Steering Committee of<br />\nthe Coalition,<br />\nLeslie Wade<br /><br />\nDethroning Reason<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLast Tuesday evening the<br />\nLebanese students at Johns<br />\nHopkins presented a Lebanese Independence celebration. This<br />\nevent was sponsored in part by<br />\nthe GRO, the departments of<br />\nFrench &amp; Near Eastern Studies,<br />\nas well as Middle East Airlines.<br />\nOn the agenda was the Ambassador of Lebanon, as well as<br />\nthe Ambassador of the League of<br />\nArab States,Clovis Maksoud. It<br />\nis quite ironic that a representative of this organization was invited to speak on a Lebanese \"independence day\" celebration,<br />\nwhen in fact the League of Arab<br />\nStates legitimized the occupation<br />\nby Syria of a sizeable portion of<br />\nLebanon in 1976\u2014declaring the<br />\nSyrian troops to be the majority<br />\nof an \"all-Arab peace-keeping<br />\nforce.\" The mandate given to<br />\nSyria was maintained by this<br />\norganization despite Syria's open<br />\ndesires to annex Lebanon. To this<br />\nend, Syria does not even maintain<br />\ndiplomatic relations with Beirut<br />\nand regularly violates Lebanese<br />\n\"independence.\" Furthermore,<br />\nthe Arab League's major preoccupation, and indeed almost main<br />\njustification historically, has been<br />\nthe political, propaganda,<br />\neconomic, and military offensive<br />\nagainst Israel.<br />\nAt the event, the Lebanese Ambassador's representative gave a<br />\nmoving speech on Lebanon's<br />\nspirit to survive, and called for<br />\nthe removal of foreign troops<br />\nfrom his nation. This seemed<br />\nquite a reasonable and promising<br />\nposition. However, when the<br />\nAmbassador from the League of<br />\nArab States addressed the audience, the first statement was<br />\nthat America's relations with<br />\nIsrael should be permanently<br />\naltered due to the disclosure of the<br />\nAmerican-Iranian arms deal.<br />\nClaiming that America has been<br />\naffected adversely by its relationship with Israel is his entitled<br />\nopinion\u2014what relevance it had<br />\nwith Lebanon's independence day<br />\nwas not the clearest thing that<br />\nevening.<br />\nIn his address, Mr. Maksoud<br />\nrepeated the often heard panacea<br />\nthat if Israel withdraws her troops<br />\nfrom the narrow southern security zone it has in Lebanon, peace<br />\nwill be at hand in all of Lebanon<br />\nby the bolstering of that nation's<br /><br />\ncentral government. Unfortunately, Mr. Maksoud forgot to point<br />\nout that this is the same central<br />\ngovernment that was bullied by<br />\nSyria into negating a peace treaty with Israel that provided for<br />\nwithdrawal.<br />\nIsraeli<br />\nthat<br />\nMr. Maksoud's call for U.N.<br />\ntroops to fill the created gap<br />\nneglects to mention that it was the<br />\nimpotence of these troops in the<br />\nfirst place\u2014the maintenance of<br />\nlarge terrorist bases within the<br />\nU.N. controlled areas\u2014that caused the incursion by Israel in the<br />\nfirst place.<br />\nHowever, most importantly,<br />\nMr. Maksoud neglected to mention Syria at all in his address.<br />\nSurely in any discussion on<br />\nLebanese sovereignty, an army<br />\nthat occupies half the nation<br />\nwould be mentioned. Instead, the<br />\nIsraeli presence on a narrow strip<br />\nin the south is the cause of all of<br />\nLebanon's problems.<br />\nIn a direct discussion with<br />\nMr. Maksoud after his address, he<br />\nfailed to accept any of these<br />\npoints as valid. Indeed, after talking to him for several minutes, he<br />\nseemed to become quite agitated.<br />\nUpon countering his claim of<br />\nIsraeli expansionism in the region<br />\nwith the incidences of Israeli<br />\nwithdrawal from parts of the<br />\nGolan heights, the approaches to<br />\nCairo, the entire Sinai peninsula<br />\nand almost the whole of southern<br />\nLebanon after the 1982 invasion,<br />\nhe called me an \"Israeli fascist\"<br />\nand stormed away.<br />\nIn the Ambassador of the<br />\nLeague of Arab States' address,<br />\nhe called for the academic world<br />\nto \"argue against the dethronement of reason.\" I find it disappointing that segments of the<br />\nacademic world here would find<br />\nit necessary to invite a man<br />\nrepresenting an organization that<br />\nis in the business of dethroning<br />\nreason\u2014actions which not only<br />\naffect Israel adversely, but also<br />\nprevent the freedom and independence of Lebanon that we<br />\nwould all like to see.<br />\nScott David Lippe<br />\nDirector, Hopkins<br />\nJewish League<br /><br />\ndismissed on scientific grounds.<br />\nIts premise, that there is a large<br />\nand stubborn average IQ difference between blacks and<br />\nwhites is surely one of the most<br />\ndocumented<br />\nexhaustively<br />\nphenomena in the social sciences.<br />\nMuch of our recent work has involved pulling together scattered<br />\ndata that are already widely accepted in the scientific<br />\nliterature. And our analyses,<br />\nwhich involve estimating how<br />\nlarge an impact the average IQ<br />\ndifference has in various social<br />\narenas, have been reviewed<br />\nfavorably\u2014in print as well as in<br />\nprivate correspondence\u2014by experts in relevant disciplines.<br />\nSo why is this research, like the<br />\nresearch documenting the IQ difference itself, often summarily<br />\nrejected without examination?<br />\nWhy, in fact, do editors of scientific journals often balk at<br />\npublishing such research, even<br />\nwhen they volunteer that it is<br />\nscientifically sound, and even<br />\n\"important?\" And why do normally irascible scientists who are<br />\nthemselves convinced that the IQ<br />\ngap is real nonetheless observe<br />\nthe current taboo against discussing it publicly? In other contexts<br />\nsuch behaviors would be inconceivable, or at least embarrassing, to people who normally<br />\nvalue liberty and unfettered<br />\nscience.<br />\nThe answer probably lies with<br />\nthe common belief that mere<br />\ndiscussion of group IQ differences is harmful, even when<br />\nthe IQ differences are real. Thus,<br />\none commonly sees references,<br />\nlike those in recent News-Letters,<br />\nto our research and similar work<br />\nas \"dangerous racism\" and<br />\n\"psychological lynching,\" as<br />\nwell as comparisons of that work<br />\nwith \"other forms of oppression\"<br />\nsuch as Hitler's racist ideology,<br />\nApartheid, Ku Klux Klan lynchings, and slavery. Frequent<br />\nalso are references to the supposed threat that such research poses<br />\nto \"the harmonious existence of<br />\nall people.\"<br />\nA companion belief appears to<br />\nbe that maintaining a discreet<br />\nsilence does no harm, even when<br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\nthe IQ differences are real. This<br />\nbelief would help to explain why<br />\neditors of respected scientific<br />\njournals have sometimes declined to publish our research,<br />\ndespite its scientific value,<br />\nbecause of \"considerations on<br />\nhow a multi-ethnic and multiracial society can survive<br />\nthat. . . may well overweigh the<br />\nclaims of social science.\" The<br />\nimpression is created that some<br />\ninformation and ideas are<br />\ndangerous, even in a democracy,<br />\nand that the welfare of blacks and<br />\nsociety as a whole is enhanced by<br />\nsuppressing them.<br />\nBut is this true? Might not it be<br />\nunwise in the long run to enforce<br />\na myth that more and more people are realizing is false? Might<br />\nnot it be unethical to deny blacks<br />\nand whites knowledge that might<br />\nallow them to make more informed decisions and fashion more effective social policy? Denying the<br />\nreality of IQ differences does<br />\nnothing to blunt their relentless<br />\nimpact on performance in school,<br />\nat work, and in other areas of<br />\nsocial life.<br />\nAnd does it really facilitate<br />\n\"the harmonious existence of all<br />\npeople\" when the Left accuses<br />\nthe American public of lack of<br />\ncompassion, the Right accuses<br />\nblacks of lack of effort, and<br />\nblacks accuse whites of<br />\nsystematic oppression, all<br />\npresumably out of concern over<br />\ndifferences in life outcomes<br />\nwhich actually may be traced in<br />\nlarge part to differences in IQ?<br />\nNo one who has grappled<br />\nhonestly with the unsettling<br />\ndilemmas posed by stubborn<br />\ngroup differences in intelligence<br />\npretends that discussing them is<br />\neasy, that our moral choices are<br />\nclear, or that knaves and fools of<br />\nall races won't complicate our efforts to cope effectively and<br />\nhumanely with them.

It's not hard<br />\nto explain. We expect more from<br />\nour government.. we expect our<br />\ngovernment to at least strive for<br />\nthe goal of being a moral nation.<br />\nWe hold our government to a<br />\nhigher standard, and if we don't<br />\nthen I believe we are neither being good journalists nor good<br />\nAmericans.\"<br />\nSchonberg declared that the<br />\nhumanitarian tradition in America<br />\nis not a myth. \"It's not the result<br />\nof some advertising campaign. So<br />\nwhen we leave the humanitarian<br />\npractice completely out of our<br />\nforeign policy, when we use a<br />\nsmaller country such as Cambodia for an imagined larger geopolitical purpose without stopping<br />\nto consider the potential consequences to the Cambodian people, we debase our tradition.\u2014<br />\nInsisting that we are a moral<br />\nnation., Schonberg asserted that<br />\nits not logical to justify a<br />\nmisguided policy by saying that<br />\nthe Russians are immoral.<br />\n\"Democracy by its nature must<br />\nbear the disadvantage of being<br />\njudged differently. In the literal<br />\nsense, it's not fair, it's a<br />\nliability\u2014it makes us less efficient<br />\nthan totalitarian states, but in the<br />\nend it's a fundamental strength.\"<br />\nThe only alternative, according<br />\nto Schonberg, would be to accept<br />\nthe totalitarian standard of<br />\neverything goes. He cited an example, reminding us that we are<br />\nnever surprised when the Soviet<br />\nUnion rolls. its tanks into the<br />\ncapital of some smaller.<br />\nvulnerable country. but we were<br />\nshocked back in Vietnam. when<br />\nwe saw on television screens<br />\nfilms of United States Marines<br />\nsetting fire to the thatch houses of<br />\nVietnamese farmers.

It's<br />\nhealthy for it helps to keep our<br />\ngovernment from slipping into<br />\nhad habits\u2014habits that would imitate our totalitarian adversaries.<br />\nCommenting on the kind of<br />\ngovernment we have now in<br />\n1986. Schonberg declared that<br />\n\"No one with eyes and ears can<br />\nfail to see and know that we are<br />\nliving in a period where many of<br />\nour leaders are telling us. in so<br />\nmany words, that our selfish instincts are O.K.\u2014nothing to be<br />\nashamed about.\u2014 The dominant<br />\nunderlying theme being conveyed, according to Schonberg. is<br />\nthat \"we no longer have to worry<br />\nabout people who are not making<br />\nit. We are being told that such<br />\npeople will either pull themselves<br />\nup by their bootstraps or else<br />\ngroup themselves unworthy of<br />\nour prosperity, and thereby<br />\nbecome expendable. You might<br />\ncall them discardable people,\u2014<br />\ncommented<br />\nSchonberg<br />\nsarcastically.<br />\nSchonberg went on to speak<br /><br />\nabout New York City as a symbol of what's going on in the<br />\nUnited States. He lamented the<br />\nvast number of homeless people<br />\nin New York City. and criticized<br />\nMayor Edward Koch, who, he<br />\nsaid, does not ask about the consequences for the people who will<br />\nno longer be able to afford to live<br />\nin these \"luxury pyramids\u2022' that<br />\nare being established, and that<br />\nwill no longer be able tO afford<br />\nthe prices in the trendy shops that<br />\nare replacing the neighborhood<br />\nstores. \"Where will all these people go\u2014is anyone asking, does<br />\nanyone care? Are not these people just as much the lifeblood of<br />\nany city as are the men who put<br />\nbuildings in the clouds but cannot<br />\nseem . to see the people in the<br />\nstreets below.\u2014 Schonberg cited<br />\nthe crises as being the fact that<br />\nenough houses are not being built<br />\nfor people that they can afford\u2014<br />\n\"for people that are members of<br />\nthe working class,\u2014 he stressed,<br />\nmaintaining that only some are on<br />\nwelfare and that others are working or want to work.<br />\n\"It seems to me that these are<br />\nthe kind of is,sues that an<br />\nenergetic press, an energetic<br />\nmedia ought to be examining all<br />\nover the country,\u2014 Schonberg<br />\ndeclared. \"Instead we have a<br />\nrather tame and flabby press in<br />\nAmerica.

I<br />\nthough Boston's Third Stage (or<br />\nSpringsteen's Live, or the Top<br />\nGun soundtrack) was the best<br />\nalbum of the year.Therefore, I'll declare my subjectivity up front, and call the<br />\nfollowing list \"My Ten Favorite<br />\nRecords of 1986.\"<br />\nAll in all, it's been a pretty<br />\ngood year for music. The Top 40<br />\nwas full of the usual dross, with<br />\na few notable exceptions, but look<br />\non the bright sidecWham! broke<br />\nup, Peter Gabriel had his first<br />\nmegahit, and Motley Crue didn't<br />\nrelease a new album.<br />\nAnd there were enough appealing LPs released to ensure plenty of runners-up for this list, including Depeche Mode's Black<br />\nCelebration, Anna Domino's<br />\nself-titled album, Stutter by<br />\nJames, and Robyn Hitchcock's<br />\nElement of Light. But let's get<br />\nright to the ten that were my tops<br />\nin pops.<br />\n1. The Woodentops, Giant(Columbia). This young British band<br />\ndoesn't need to fake exuberance,<br />\nsincerity and energy; they've got<br />\nthem in spades. That's what<br />\nmakes listening to Giant such a<br />\njoyful experience. From the<br />\nlightning-fast licks of \"Love<br />\nTrain\" to the gentle groove of<br />\n\"Good Thing,\" Giant is one<br />\nhugely entertaining record.<br />\n2. The Woodentops, Well Well<br />\nWe// (Upside). This compilation<br /><br />\n7. The Housemartins, London 0<br />\nHull 4(Elektra). These tour Brits<br />\narc endearing musical Marxists,<br />\nsetting socially-aware lyrics to the<br />\ncatchiest of pop tunes. Songs like<br />\nHappy Hour\" and \"Sheep\" are<br />\nnonstop, upbeat fun, while the<br />\nmore reflective \"Think For A<br />\nMinute- and the gospel-tinged<br />\n\"I'll Be Your Shelter\" show the<br />\nband's more sober side.<br />\n8. The Pretenders, Get Close<br />\n(Sire). Chrissic Hynde has come<br />\na long, long way since the cool<br />\nrebel stance of her \"Precious\"<br />\ndays\u2014she's now the only original<br />\nPretender, a wife and mother,<br />\nand definitely grown-up. Gel<br />\nClose is a refreshingly mature<br />\nrock album, free of gimmicks and<br />\nfrills, full of solid songwriting<br />\nand energetic playing.<br /><br />\nE M\u2022<br />\nof the 'Tops' early singles doesn't<br />\nhave Giant's slick and polished<br />\nsound. It's closer in spirit to their<br />\nfast-and-furious live shows. And<br />\nthere's more variety among the<br />\nsongs here\u2014\"Steady Steady\" is<br />\na masterpiece of cathartic angst,<br />\n\"Do It Anyway- is a modern<br />\nrockabilly romp, and the title<br />\ntrack flirts with but never falls into complete musical anarchy.<br />\n3. Throwing Muses, Throwing<br />\nMuses (4AD import). Artful<br />\nlyrics, nightmare visions,<br />\nchallenging rhythms. This<br />\nBoston-based band establishes a<br />\npowerful presence with their<br />\ndebut LP, thanks largely to<br />\nKristin Hersh's dynamic vocals.<br />\nUnpredictable, irresistible rock.<br />\n4. R.E.M., Wes Rich Pageant<br /><br />\n(I.R.S.). Hooking up with John<br />\nCougar Mellencamp's producer,<br />\nDon Gehman, was a potentially<br />\nrisky move for R.E.M. Would<br />\nLifes Rich Pageant be another sad<br />\nsellout to A.O.R. radio?<br />\nThankfully, no; big guitar solos<br />\nand tunes about sex, beer, and<br />\nrockin all night are not R.E.M.'s<br />\nstyle. Michael Stipe's thoughtful<br />\nlyrics are actually understandable<br />\nand the songs have more hooks,<br />\nbut those are changes for the<br />\nbetter.<br />\n5. Peter Gabriel, So (Geffen).<br />\n\"Sledgehammer\" is pure excitement, bouncy, funky, and 1986's<br />\nbest single by far. But there's so<br />\nmuch more to So. Kate Bush adds<br />\nan angelic vocal to \"Don't Give<br />\nUp,- one of the year's most stirring musical moments; \"In Your<br /><br />\nEyes- draws on African pop for<br />\ninspiration, and \"Big Time\" proves that Pete's still got a good<br />\nsense of humor (he did, after all,<br />\ndress up like a flower when he<br />\nwas in Genesis). A triumph.<br /><br />\n6. The Fall, Bend Sinister (Beggars Banquet import). Manchester's fabulous Fall is perhaps<br />\nthe most consistently good band<br />\nin the U.K. Every year they<br />\nrelease a new record, and every<br />\nyear it's a gem. Mark E. and Brix<br />\nSmith lead the Fall through ten<br />\ntracks, covering grunge-guitar<br />\ngarage rock (\"Mr. Pharmacist\"),<br />\nuncharacteristically perky pop<br />\n(\"Shoulder Pads\"), and much<br />\nmore. Mark E.'s curious style of<br />\nsing-speak may take sonic getting<br />\nused to, but it's worth the effort.<br /><br />\n9. That Petrol Emotion, Manic<br />\nPop Thrill (Demon import).<br />\nFormer members of the seminal<br />\nIrish band The Undertones, That<br />\nPetrol Emotion's debut LP is indeed a pop thrill. They rock out<br />\ngloriously on \"Good Thing,\" but<br />\nthe band's equally adept at<br />\nsomething as delicate and<br />\nbeautiful as \"A Natural Kind of<br />\nJoy.\" Sure to be a band worth<br />\nwatching in the future.<br />\n10. Red Lorry Yellow Lorry,<br />\nPaint Your Wagon (Red Rhino<br />\nimport). The Lorries, on the<br />\nother hand, have no use for<br />\nanything that's remotely mellow.<br />\nThis is hard, uncompromising<br />\nmusic, full of roaring guitars and<br />\nset to a brutal beat, sung by a man<br />\nwith the grimmest, darkest voice<br />\nin rock. Turn it up loud, very<br />\nloud.<br /><br />\nCellist Isserlis Gives Brilliant Recital at Shriver<br />\nby Leanna Chamish<br />\n\"Gut Strings.\" \"Gut Strings.\"<br />\nFrom almost every knot of people at the November 23rd Shriver<br />\nHall Concert Series recital I heard<br />\nthis mantra. British cellist Steven<br />\nIsserlis is one of the few cellists<br />\noutside of historically correct orchestras to use gut strings.<br />\nIsserlis, this year's Piatigorsky<br />\nContest winner, fortunately shattered my misconceptions about<br />\ncellists who use gut strings. I<br />\nthought his performance would<br />\nbe unbearably prissy. This was<br />\nnot the case at all, though his<br />\nstrongpoint is most definitely<br />\nlyricism. Isserlis conjured up a<br />\nfull range of emotions and stretched the dynamic range of gut<br />\nstrings in a most breathtaking<br />\nway. However, his sound was<br />\nfrequently lost in musical conversation with his accompanist Peter<br />\nEvans. This is not Evans' fault\u2014<br />\nhe played brilliantly and considerately. Isserlis' tone from<br />\nthose strings is gorgeous, and I<br /><br />\nthink Isserlis would be a big hit throughout all the dances Isserlis<br />\nin recordings. In the studio, was too smooth. His use of open<br />\nengineers could bring his sound string drones and double stops<br />\nforward and give it some more (possible when playing a cello in<br />\npresence and immediacy.<br />\nthe key of C major) were just too<br />\nThe program began with polite. Only in the courante did<br />\nJohann Sebastian Bach's 3rd suite Isserlis<br />\nhave<br />\nsome<br />\nfor unaccompanied cello in C ma- unselfconscious fun. Really,<br />\njor. Isserlis' interpretation was these are dances after all!<br />\noverall mannered and courtly. It<br />\nThe Sonata -2 of Czech<br />\ntook me a while to get used to this Bohuslav Martinu was written in<br />\ninterpretation. I did like it, though 1941, near the end of the comnot necessarily prefer it to other poser's neoclassical period. Marperformances that have a lot more tinu put more modern sounds inemotion. Isserlis did not use ac- to classical musical structures.<br />\ncents and ephases which I think Pianist Peter Evans began the<br />\nreally define the shape of the Sonata with a spiky statement<br />\nmusic, and there was very little which Isserlis failed to match in<br />\ndrama. The suite follows the character with his entrance. The<br />\ntemplate of the standard baroque cello did not fare well against the<br />\ndance suite. From the opening Shriver Hall Concert series amazprelude, it was clear that Isserlis ing Steinway piano. Isserlis'<br />\nis a superb and unforced techni- sound swam into obscurity when<br />\ncian. He flowed into the beautiful it should have been well defined.<br />\npassages of scales and made them In the middle largo movement,<br />\nsound improvised.

The last movement,<br />\nallegro commodo was virtuosic<br />\nand thoughtful.<br />\nAfter Intermission came<br />\nPohadka, meaning Fairy Tale, by<br />\nLeos Janacek. I love Janacek's<br />\nmusic because it usually jumps<br />\nout, grabs you, and won't let go.<br />\nPohadka is different from the<br />\nmore popular Janacek pieces but<br />\nit is still captivating. Like almost<br />\neverything Janacek wrote,<br />\nPohadka is nationalistic--it is based on a Moravian folk tale which<br />\nis weird but enchanting. In the<br />\nmusic, the cello plays the part of<br />\na prince, and the piano plays the<br />\npart of a princess who keeps turning into a duck or a blue flower.<br />\nThey live happily ever after, of<br />\ncourse. From the magical opening of the piano, this was an astounding performance from<br />\nbeginnng to end. From Isserlis'<br />\nsoft plucking to the emotional<br />\nclimaxes, Isserlis gave Pohadka<br />\na lyrical singing quality that<br /><br />\ncharmed completely. The<br />\nbuoyant last movement faded out<br />\non a firmly held but barely audible cello note that was so<br />\nbeautiful I could have cried.<br />\nClosing the program was<br />\nBrahms' Sonata -2 in F. In this<br />\nsoaring romantic work, Isserlis<br />\nsimply didn't have the appropriate tension and angst.<br />\nThere are a lot of high notes<br />\nwhich need an extra boost of<br />\nvolume to balance with a piano.<br />\nThe gut strings just didn't make<br />\nit here, and Isserlis' smooth quality did not have the sense of urgency which propels this piece forward.<br />\nIsserlis is an extremely brilliant<br />\ncellist. He plays with a sensitive<br />\nindividuality but he does have an<br />\nodd commitment to the gut<br />\nstrings, regardless of the period<br />\nof the composition. I hope he gets<br />\nto a recording studio soon,<br />\nbecause only then do I think he<br />\ncan be presented to his best<br />\nadvantage.<br /><br />\nin The Hague; works by Rembrandt, Jan Steen, and Adriaen<br />\nBrouwer are included.

Dutton, Inc.<br />\n305<br />\npp.<br />\nJoyce Carol Oates has been<br />\nwriting short stories for many<br />\nyears and firmly established an<br />\noriginal style that has come to be<br />\nexpected by readers and critics<br />\nalike. Her new book, Raven 's<br />\nWing, is no exception. This book<br />\nis a compilation of nineteen<br />\nstories, most of which have<br />\nalready appeared in respected<br />\nliterary journals. Oates is already<br />\nconsidered a master of the short<br />\nstory and anything she writes is<br />\nusually highly acclaimed.<br />\nHowever, a few of the stories in<br />\nthe collection do not measure up<br />\nto her reputation when compared<br />\nwith others in the book.<br />\nAs in other collections, each of<br />\nthe stories in Raven's Wing contains its own little world, and<br />\nOates focuses on the characters<br />\nrather than the plot; each story is<br />\nmerely a section of the<br />\ncharacters' lives. Oates is<br />\nprimarily concerned with the<br />\nbehavior of the characters. If one<br />\nhad to describe her style and subjects<br />\nin<br />\none<br />\nword,<br />\n\"psychological\" fits perfectly.<br />\nThe subject matters of thg<br />\nstories are very unusual, but total-<br /><br />\nly believable. One is constantly<br />\namazed at the author's varied<br />\nchoice of subjects, and wonders<br />\nhow she could think up such odd<br />\nsituations. In addition, the stories<br />\ntend to be extremely disturbing.<br />\nIn \"The Jesuit,\" a young professor becomes obsessed with the<br />\nnotion that one of her colleagues,<br />\na Jesuit priest, hates her without<br />\nreason. \"Happy\" is a four-page<br />\nstory that illustrates the fierce<br />\nneed some people feel to appear<br />\nhappy. The tone is insistent, and<br />\nthrough the character's desperate<br />\nand repititious declarations that<br />\nthey are indeed happy, one sees<br />\nthat they are not at all. In \"Little<br />\nWife,\" a young boy is unable to<br />\ncome to terms with the fact that<br />\nhis father and his drinking buddies are keeping a teenager in<br />\ntheir house as a \"willing prostitute.\" The men begin viciously to abuse the girl, and without<br />\nthe boy's help she would probably die.<br />\nSymbols play a crucial part in<br />\nOates' stories. For example, in<br />\n\"Seasons,\" two adopted kittens<br />\nbecome a representation of their<br />\nowners. Oates doesn't say this<br />\noutright, but the reader is able to<br />\nsee an underlying connection between the kittens and the man and<br />\nwoman throughout the story.<br />\nOats is a supreme example of an<br />\nauthor who \"shows\" rather than<br />\n\"tells\" the characters' feelings<br /><br />\nand situations.<br />\nThe problem with short story<br />\ncollections is that one tends to<br />\nread them all at once as if it were<br />\na novel.

Other eye<br />\ndiseases hinder the ability of the<br />\nphotoreceptor cells to absorb<br />\nlight, or kills the cells, causing<br />\nblindness. Dr. Ruben Adler,<br />\nassociate professor of ophthalmology and neurosciences, and his<br />\nteam of colleagues at the Wilmer<br />\nEye Institute of the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine are in<br />\nthe process of studying and \"attempting to understand these<br />\nlight-sensitive photoreceptor<br />\ncells, whose mysteries hide the<br />\ncures for many eye diseases.<br />\nTo study these cells, Dr. Adler<br />\nhas devised a method that has<br />\ngreatly increased our chances of<br />\nunderstanding the photoreceptor<br />\ncells. He first carefully dissects<br />\nan 8-day old chick embryo to<br />\nremove the retina. He then treats<br />\nthis undeveloped tissue with enzymes to loosen them up, thus<br />\ncreating a suspension of isolated<br />\nsingle cells. These cells are then<br />\ntreated with two groups of<br />\nchemicals: one that keeps them<br />\nalive, and another that settles the<br />\ncells, causing them to individually stick to the bottom of a dish.<br />\nThe fact that these cells are<br />\nisolated allows Dr. Adler to pick<br />\nout individual cells to observe and<br />\nstudy. This sometimes involves<br />\nthe use of a video camera that<br />\ncaptures the growth and development of the cell on videotape for<br />\nothers to observe. From studying<br />\nthe growth of individual photoreceptor cells, Dr. Adler is trying to find out what these cells<br />\nneed in order to stay alive and<br />\nfunction, the pathological agents<br /><br />\nthat<br />\nnormal genes can cause their<br />\ndegeneration.<br />\nTo understand the factors that<br />\nkeep the photoreceptor cells alive<br />\nand functioning, different conditions must be considered. First,<br />\nDr. Adler observes the effects<br />\ndifferent substances that might<br />\ncome into contact with these cells<br />\nhave on the individual cells.<br />\nThen, knowing that within the<br />\nretina photoreceptor cells are in<br />\ncontact with many other different<br />\ntypes of cells (neurons, glial) he<br />\ntries to identify the contributions<br />\nthat these various cells have on<br />\nthe well-being of the photoreceptor cells. The goal of the study is<br />\nto identify the nutrients necessary<br />\nfor keeping the photoreceptor<br />\ncells healthy.<br />\nFinding pathological agents<br />\nthat kill these cells involves the<br />\nsame method of experimentation<br />\nin finding which chemicals or<br />\nsubstances cause harm to the<br />\ncells. Finding the health-deterring<br />\nagents will then increase the<br />\nchances of finding a way to effectively protect the cell.<br />\nIt is well-known that the<br />\npresence of certain abnormal<br />\ngenes causes the cells to<br />\ndegenerate. To understand exactly what cell deficiencies and inabilities an abnormal gene<br />\ncreates, Adler is trying to find the<br />\nspecial environment that allows<br />\nthe cells to function properly<br />\ndespite their inabilities. Actual<br />\nexperimentation and study of ths<br />\nproblem involves the photoreceptor cells of newborn mice\u2014<br />\nnormal mice and a strain of mice<br />\nthat have the defective gene.<br />\nAdler then compares the reactions<br />\nof these two different types of<br />\ncells to ultimately find the proper<br />\nenvironment that the defective<br />\ncells need in order to survive.<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nSt<br />\n0<br /><br />\nCourtesy of Hopkins Hospital<br /><br />\nDr. Ruben Adler at the Wilmer Eye Institute uses isolated photoreceptor cells like the one pictured here to<br />\nstudy the effects of chemical and environmental agents on the retina.<br /><br />\nAdler's project has led to many<br />\nimportant developments and findings. The past idea that<br />\nphotoreceptor cells can not be<br />\ngrown individually for observation has been refuted by Adler.<br />\nAlso, Adler has found several<br />\nnutrients that seem essential for<br />\npreserving photoreceptor cell life.<br />\nLike all research projects, problems have been encountered.<br />\nThe proper method of growing<br />\nthe photoreceptor cells took ten<br />\nyears to discover, one of the main<br /><br />\ndifficulties involved getting rid of<br />\nthe many glial cells (other cells<br />\npresent on the retina) that tended<br />\nto dominate cultures. It was also<br />\nnecessary to study the cells with<br />\nmany different methods to demonstrate their identity and to compare the properties of cultured<br />\nphotoreceptors with the properties of the same cells in the intact<br />\nanima).<br />\nThe fact that the approach of<br />\nisolating certain cells for individual study has proved his-<br /><br />\ntorically successful in finding the<br />\ncauses of other diseases gives<br />\nAdler reason to feel his research<br />\nis trying to solve a problem in the<br />\nproper way. He hopes that the<br />\nfindings derived from these<br />\nstudies will contribute significantly to the prevention and treatment<br />\nof disease, in which the degeneration of photoreceptor cells leads<br />\nto blindness.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Children's Center:<br />\nPhysician-Scientists for the Little Ones<br />\nby Ely Brown<br />\nAt the Johns Hopkins<br />\nChildren's Center it is a team effort in the fight against cancer.<br />\nCurt Civin, M.D.. Brian Corder,<br />\nM.D., Ph.D., Michael Graham,<br />\nM.D.,, Brigid Leventhal, M.D.,<br />\nand Lewis Strauss, M.D. are five<br />\nphysician-scientists who have<br />\ndedicated their lives to the study<br />\nand treatment of pediatric<br />\noncology.<br />\nThese doctors are part of the<br />\nnew breed of medical practitioners who are not only involved in the treatment and diagnosis<br />\nof cancer, but are also part of the<br />\nresearch and investigation end of<br />\nthe spectrum; ergo the name<br />\nphysician-scientist. Although<br />\nconventional means are still used<br />\nto treat patients, these doctors are<br />\nunhappy with current therapies,<br />\ndrugs, and treatments because of<br />\nthe pain, time and money involved with them. Although cancer in<br />\nanyone is tragic, it is particularly heartrending and unfair to see<br /><br />\nit strike a child. Because of this<br />\nfact, these doctors are trying to<br />\nimprove today's therapies by<br />\nmaking them shorter and less<br />\ntraumatic for the kids and thus<br />\nletting them get on with their<br />\nlives.<br />\nEach physician carries on<br />\nresearch in addition to his or her<br />\ntreatment of patients. Dr. Corder<br />\nis currently exploring the effects<br />\nthat Cisplatin, a soluble derivative<br />\nof the element platinum, has on<br />\nsolid tumors. This drug has been<br />\nsuccessful in the treatment of<br />\ngerm cell tumors, but in some<br />\ncases has side effects that can<br />\ncause kidney and hearing problems. Corder has been trying to<br />\nminimize the toxicity of the drug<br />\nwhile maintaining its effectiveness.<br />\nPlatinum has also been found to<br />\nbe effective in the treatment of<br />\nbrain tumors, which account for<br />\none third of all tumors in<br />\nchildren. Because brain tumors in<br />\nchildren are often inoperable, and<br />\n, the brain is highly sensitive to<br /><br />\nradiation treatments, a new approach has been sought after.<br />\nCorder, along with Leventhal and<br />\nStrauss have been working with<br />\ndrugs that are combinations<br />\nwhich include platinum. Platinum<br />\nis an element that can cross the<br />\nbrain-blood barrier that exists and<br />\ndrugs made with it have been effective in shrinking pediatric<br />\nbrain tumors and thus postponing<br />\npossible radiation or surgery.<br />\nDr. Graham is currently studying how certain drugs effect<br />\nleukemia in children. One in particular is Methtrexate, which has<br />\nbeen proven to be an integral part<br />\nof a patient's therapy. Today,<br />\nwith drugs like this one, they expect to cure the \"average\" patient where 10 or 12 years ago<br />\nthey could not have. But still<br />\nthese doctors are not satisfied.<br />\nThey want to make the treatment<br />\nshorter, create a pill form of the<br />\ndrug to take away needless shots,<br />\nand IV's, and simply make it as<br />\neasy as possible on the kids, some<br />\nof whom are too young to even<br /><br />\nunderstand what is happening.<br />\nAlthough 901of leukemia partients can be cured, the possibility of remission remains. One<br />\ntreatment then used is a bone<br />\nmarrow transplant. Dr. Civin,<br />\nalong with Dr. Strauss. is studying ways to make this treatment<br />\nmore effective in leukemia pa.<br />\ntients. They are observing the<br />\ngrowth processes of the stem cells<br />\nin the marrow and how cancer<br />\ncausing genes called oncogenes,<br />\ngive rise to tumors. They are also<br />\nworking on ways to reduce the<br />\npossibility of rejection by the<br />\ntransplant of the body. In a<br />\ntransplant immune cells can be<br />\nmoved along with the stem cells,<br />\nbut now an antibody has been<br />\ndeveloped to separate the<br />\nnecessary stem cells and<br />\ntransplant them only.<br />\nThe team method employed<br />\ndown at the center does not include just these 5 doctors. There<br />\nare radiologists. neurosurgeons,<br />\nsocial workes, child life workers,<br />\npsychiatrists, and others who are<br /><br />\na part of it. Cancer in children<br />\ncauses incredible problems emotionally as well as financially in<br />\nboth the patient and the family.<br />\nThese people realize that their patients are still developing, as well<br />\nas emotionally,and have special<br />\nproblems.
