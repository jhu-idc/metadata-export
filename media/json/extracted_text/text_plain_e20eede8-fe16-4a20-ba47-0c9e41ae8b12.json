It is not an imposition on student<br />\nfreedom (a pattern of action that strikes dread into<br />\nthe hearts of those who value their liberties beyond their<br />\nworth) nor an action for the protection of the purity of<br />\nthe young men's minds, but a device for the protection<br />\nof the University,<br />\nIn substances, the ruling aims at regulating the<br />\nalcohol flow into the stands; in method, it aims to<br />\nregulate the kind of people that enter. But in kind, the<br />\nruling has no other goal than to keep the appearance<br />\nof the University away from evil.<br />\nIn fact, it is a clever ruling. One can rightly infer<br />\nthat if a person is able to conceal enough spirits on his<br />\nperson to pass inspection at the gate, then he deserves to<br />\nhave his booze and drink it too.<br />\nAnd 88 a point of information, Hopkins is not alone<br />\nin such an attempt to curb the consequences of drinking.<br />\nPrinceton has Initiated a similar program of discipline.<br />\nThe public image of the University, for better or<br />\nworse, very much controls its purse strings.

Their status is based much on curiosity. The invulnerability of traditions in literature, and<br />\nin truth, the independence of the creative arts from<br />\nworld opinion allows for such exploration.<br />\nAn Anti-University, on the other hand, is entirely<br />\nimpractical. And the administration's attempt to restore<br />\nsome order to sports speetatordom is an implementation of that thesis.<br />\nThe following editorial was written by Larry Schmidt, President of the Inter-fraternity Council.<br />\n<br />\nThe recent administrative action regarding the<br />\ntransportation of packaged goods and the admittance<br />\nof undesirable elements to the Homewood stadium has<br />\nled, naturally enough, to much discussion among fraternity members.<br />\nIt has been the practice in the past years for fraternities to sit together in the stands, and it has further<br />\nbeen the practice, in general, for members to bring<br />\nrefreshments of alcoholic content to the games. Conseplenty, the administrative action directly affects the<br />\nfraternity system as a whole since this practice was a<br />\ncommon one among some fraternities. At this point it<br />\nmust be emphasized that although the fraternities have<br />\nbeen responsible for bringing some packaged liquor to<br />\nthe game, they are by no means directly responsible for<br />\nthe action taken. President Eisenhower, and Deans<br />\nSchaeffer, Morrill, and Strider have made it quite clear<br />\nthat the outside visitors have played a considerable role<br />\nin the formulation of this policy, and, by this, reference<br />\nis made to area high school students and visiting alumni.<br />\nGranted, in some instances the privilege, and it was a<br />\nprivilege and not a right, was abused by Hopkins students, both independents and fraternity men. But this<br />\nprivilege had also become free license for the community at large to come to the Hopkins' campus on Saturday afternoon to \"tie on\" a cheap and unprohibited<br />\ndrunk. The result has been a blight on the Hopkins'<br />\nname and both verbal and financial reprisals by those<br />\nof the non-Hopkins community who have special interests in the institution.<br />\nThe administration had willingly approached this<br />\nproblem over the past few years with the students' interests in mind. To date no system, student vigilante or<br />\notherwise, had met with anything but a modicum of success at best, and it was generally agreed among the situ(Continued on Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nMazeltov, Sandy!<br />\nBy HENRY KORN<br />\nThe Jewish Holidays and the<br />\nWorld Series are with us again.<br />\nYet it was not until this year<br />\nthat the chonological combination yielded an appropriate cultural link.<br />\nIn order to reach a full understanding of this complex involvement a visit to the local sites of<br />\nboth activities is necessary.<br />\nFirst I would suggest a ride<br />\nup Park Heights Avenue to survey an impressive lineup of<br />\nSynagogues.

It is not an imposition on student<br />\nfreedom (a pattern of action that strikes dread into<br />\nthe hearts of those who value their liberties beyond their<br />\nworth) nor an action for the protection of the purity of<br />\nthe young men's minds, but a device for the protection<br />\nof the University,<br />\nIn substances, the ruling aims at regulating the<br />\nalcohol flow into the stands; in method, it aims to<br />\nregulate the kind of people that enter. But in kind, the<br />\nruling has no other goal than to keep the appearance<br />\nof the University away from evil.<br />\nIn fact, it is a clever ruling. One can rightly infer<br />\nthat if a person is able to conceal enough spirits on his<br />\nperson to pass inspection at the gate, then he deserves to<br />\nhave his booze and drink it too.<br />\nAnd 88 a point of information, Hopkins is not alone<br />\nin such an attempt to curb the consequences of drinking.<br />\nPrinceton has Initiated a similar program of discipline.<br />\nThe public image of the University, for better or<br />\nworse, very much controls its purse strings.

Their status is based much on curiosity. The invulnerability of traditions in literature, and<br />\nin truth, the independence of the creative arts from<br />\nworld opinion allows for such exploration.<br />\nAn Anti-University, on the other hand, is entirely<br />\nimpractical. And the administration's attempt to restore<br />\nsome order to sports speetatordom is an implementation of that thesis.<br />\nThe following editorial was written by Larry Schmidt, President of the Inter-fraternity Council.<br /><br />\nThe recent administrative action regarding the<br />\ntransportation of packaged goods and the admittance<br />\nof undesirable elements to the Homewood stadium has<br />\nled, naturally enough, to much discussion among fraternity members.<br />\nIt has been the practice in the past years for fraternities to sit together in the stands, and it has further<br />\nbeen the practice, in general, for members to bring<br />\nrefreshments of alcoholic content to the games. Conseplenty, the administrative action directly affects the<br />\nfraternity system as a whole since this practice was a<br />\ncommon one among some fraternities. At this point it<br />\nmust be emphasized that although the fraternities have<br />\nbeen responsible for bringing some packaged liquor to<br />\nthe game, they are by no means directly responsible for<br />\nthe action taken. President Eisenhower, and Deans<br />\nSchaeffer, Morrill, and Strider have made it quite clear<br />\nthat the outside visitors have played a considerable role<br />\nin the formulation of this policy, and, by this, reference<br />\nis made to area high school students and visiting alumni.<br />\nGranted, in some instances the privilege, and it was a<br />\nprivilege and not a right, was abused by Hopkins students, both independents and fraternity men. But this<br />\nprivilege had also become free license for the community at large to come to the Hopkins' campus on Saturday afternoon to \"tie on\" a cheap and unprohibited<br />\ndrunk. The result has been a blight on the Hopkins'<br />\nname and both verbal and financial reprisals by those<br />\nof the non-Hopkins community who have special interests in the institution.<br />\nThe administration had willingly approached this<br />\nproblem over the past few years with the students' interests in mind.

The Jays gained 86 yards<br />\nin 17 carries, an average of over<br />\nfive yards a try, but too much of<br />\nit cames in big chunks, as the<br />\nteam was unable to mount a<br />\nsustained ground attack.<br />\nParthmore Stars<br />\nThe squad's prime offensive<br />\nmovement came on the strength<br />\nof the passing of junior Parthmore, who completed ten of<br /><br />\nnineteen tosses for 105 yards and<br />\nthe two touchdowns. Five of his<br />\npasses went to All-Maryland end<br />\nMike Oidick.<br />\nParthmore's performance looks<br />\neven better when compared to<br />\nthat of FezM's Seiki Murono,<br />\nwho though running well, had a<br />\ntough time in the air, partially<br />\nbecause of poor receiving. The<br />\nthird - string All-Pennsylvania<br />\npick completed seven of sixteen<br />\nfor eighty-four yards.<br />\nStandouts Tabbed<br />\nTabbed as offensive standouts<br />\nby Fewster were Parthmore, Siggers, and Oidick, while defensively high praise came for Denny Ferrazzano's work at middle<br />\nlinebacker and the tackling of<br />\nJim Calli and Bob Shannon in<br />\nthe secondary.<br />\nReturning to action this week<br />\nwill be third string quarterback<br />\nand defensive starter Mike Shaw,<br />\nwho will excuse Parthmore from<br />\nplaying both ways. Lineman Mike<br />\nGersick is also expected to see<br />\nslight action.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER B. 196S<br /><br />\nPitchmen Tromp Gettysburg;<br />\nHost Strong Delaware Tues.<br />\nBy MARSHALL PAUL<br />\nCoach Gary Barrette's entire<br />\nfront line scored Wednesday as<br />\nthe varsity soccer team ran down<br />\nGettysburg 5-0.<br />\nThe pitchmen, who host Delaware Tuesday, were given a twopoint edge at the end of the<br />\nfirst half on goals by Gondis<br />\nGucer and Wes Bachur. Pablo<br />\nDrobny got the assist on Gucer's<br />\ngoal. Bachur's tally, from the<br />\nright corner, was unassisted.<br />\nGettysburg came out strong in<br />\nthe next half, but its spirit was<br />\nbroken when the Gettysburg<br />\ngoalie collided with a fullback,<br />\nallowing Drobny to niche another point. Two minutes later,<br />\nDrobny assisted again, this time<br />\nwith soph Kit Battenfeld scoring.<br />\nWarren Isom, on a pass from<br />\nJohn Taylor, scored Hopkins'<br />\nlast goal in the fourth quarter.<br />\n\"Although Gettysburg is not<br />\none of the better teams we face,<br />\nwe did smooth out some problems,\" stated Barrette. \"Our<br />\nfullbacks played better, and our<br /><br />\nNavy, West Virginia Listed<br />\nOn Rifle Team's '65 Slate<br />\nThe varsity rifle team will be<br />\ncompeting this year with nationally-ranked West Virginia, Navy,<br />\nPenn Military College, and Penn<br />\nState, Captain Larry Caruthers<br />\nannounced.<br />\nIn addition to competing in<br />\ndual or triangular matches with<br />\nthese teams, the Blue Jays will<br />\ncompete in the annual U.S. Coast<br />\nguard<br />\nAcademy<br />\nInvitational<br />\ntournament in March.<br />\nDoak Returns<br />\nWes Doak, back again this<br />\nyear, captured the third-high<br /><br />\ndefense was solid. tMarv) Ortel<br />\ndid a fine job in the goal.\"<br />\nThe coach also cited the play<br />\nof Lucky Mallonee, Jim Zeverly,<br />\nand Bob Knauff, who bottled up<br />\nGettysburg's All-America pick<br />\nRon Nix.<br />\nThe Jays preceded this game<br />\nwith a 2-0 opening loss to Dickinson. The host club used all of<br />\nIts seventeen returning lettermen<br />\nto take a 1-0 half time lead.<br />\n\"We came out like terrors in<br />\nthe third quarter,\" recalled Barrette. \"We pressed them into<br />\nmaking a foul but their goalie<br />\nmade a fantastic save to stop our<br />\npenalty kick\"<br />\nThe Jays continued to press<br />\nfor another five minutes, letting<br />\nDickinson out of its defensive<br />\narea only twice in that quarter.<br />\nHowever, Dickinson ecked out a<br />\nsecond point when a fullback<br />\nshielded the Hopkins goalie, allowing a shot to dribble in.<br />\nDelaware, whom the.Jays meet<br />\nnext, should be strong, according<br />\nto Barrette.<br /><br />\nTHIS IS<br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nindividual honors close behind<br />\ntwo West Point cadets who tied<br />\nfor the one-two spots.
