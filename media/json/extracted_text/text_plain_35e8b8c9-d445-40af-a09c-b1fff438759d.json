I read 'Charley\" Bump's name<br />\nunder that piece of advice with a little surprise. Knowing him for so good a<br />\nnewspaper man as he is, I might fairly have expected him to be even a little<br />\nenthusiastic on the other side. He feels toward his business, however, as many<br />\nof the men do who have come to know any part of it with any intimacy. The<br />\nnewspaper business isn't a good thing for anybody unless it is a good thing<br />\nThat's equally true of any other business,\" you reply And so it is. But<br />\nthe newspaper business is overcrowded with men who are misplaced in it as<br />\nmuch as second story men in the sanctuary. The sanctuary, indeed, is supplied with many excellent priests. Newspaper men of the first class, I believe,<br />\nare not nearly so common in the newspaper business.<br />\nA graduate student of Dr. Ames' department probably expressed the chief<br />\nreason for this a few nights ago. \"Ah,\" he said to me, \"but there's a glamor<br />\nabout a newspaper man's life!\" I've heard this so often that I'm beginning to<br />\nbelieve it. There is a tremendous \"glamor about the newspaper man's life.\"<br />\nMost of the 'glamor\" lies in the observer's eye. It doesn't do the newspaper<br />\nman any harm if he is sensible, but it may lead the observer to make a fool of<br />\nhimself. \"Glamor\" is just the whirlpool for the college fellow whose anchor<br />\nisn't out\u2014sometimes it is strong enough to make one drag his anchor. A few<br />\nsuch craft are built for this sort of stress\u2014they drive with the swirl to its<br />\nroughest place and its speed increases their momentum; they don't last their<br />\nfull span, hut while their timbers hold they win a jolly struggle with the<br />\nstorm as others go down about them. Some beat ground and escape the whirl\u2014<br />\nafter learning enough seamanship to keep in the quiet water. Some are dis<br />\nmantled after a long fight and are thrown out without machinery or canvas<br />\ninto the open ocean\u2014derelicts. In a limited prospect, I have seen fleets of all<br />\nthese three kinds of newspaper craft.<br />\nToo many of the unfit enter the newspaper business They know a reporter who says, \"Hello, Jack!\" to a Congressman, exchanges small talk with<br />\na bishop, confers confidentially with the marshal of police, fills free seats in<br />\ntheatres, enjoys the privilege of getting drenched under the walls of a burning<br />\nwarehouse, wades in Wood at every murder, gets mysterious communications<br />\nfrom bartenders and hackmen, drinks champagne occasionally and smokes<br />\nCigars for which he doesn't pay, and then calls on the president of a woman's<br />\ncollege. This is a first-class \"glamor\" outfit. Of course, coming one after the<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nother, the Congressman, the bishop, the marshal, the bartender, the blood and<br />\nfire and water and all the rest,\u2014they have the diverting effect of novelties.<br />\nBut, then, the repetition of diversity is monotony itself. It is true that the reporter may make useful friends among those he meets. It is also true that<br />\nmost of the people he visits are not aggressively glad to see him unless they<br />\nwant something and, perhaps, have sent for him. With equal truth the report\u2022<br />\nthing<br />\ner may make enemies\u2014and he sometimes does. Here is an exasperating<br />\nhis<br />\nin<br />\nnot<br />\nhim,<br />\nto<br />\ncome<br />\nThey<br />\nincurs:<br />\nhe<br />\nenmities<br />\nabout a great many of the<br />\nsome<br />\nlike<br />\nlife,<br />\nnewspaper<br />\nof<br />\n\"glamor\"<br />\nThe<br />\nown fight, but in \"The Paper's.\"<br />\nother intangible things, dissipates rather easily. Beyond the \"glamor\" of it,<br />\nin the diversity of the reporter's side of it, there is as much bodily exhaustion<br />\nand brain-fag as elsewhere; very often a great deal more than elsewhere.<br />\nCharley Bump repeats several times that the young man's \"world-illumining volume\" will never be written if he remains a conscientious newspaper man.<br />\n\"Why, that fellow must be buggy,\" I heard a freshman say, \"everybody<br />\nknows that Dickens was a reporter.\" If this boy ever comes to read the brief<br />\nest of the obituary \"notices\" he will learn that reporters pass away with the<br />\nsame regularity as millionaires, and when he has read all the longest of \"the<br />\ngreatest of recent novels\" he will understand that hundreds of thousands of<br />\nnewspaper men died during the nineteenth century, but in all that time God<br />\nmade only one Dickens. All this, however, is where the \"glamor\" used to be\u2014<br />\nin my eye. Never having coddled an ambition to \"illumine\" the \"world\"<br />\nby a \"volume,\" I feel no sting in not being able to do so. But I distrust the<br />\nnewspaper business on grounds both sentimental and commercial\u2014not for<br />\neverybody, understand, but for myself and the majority who, I believe, are<br />\nlike me.<br />\nTo spend your life in telling what other people are doing seems an empty<br />\npursuit. Yet an army of conscientious and industrious newspaper workers are<br />\nbusy at it. Let them become deeply interested in the great movements, the<br />\nlarge causes, with which they deal, and they warp their chronicle If they<br />\ntake sides, someone claims they have done him an injustice\u2014some of them<br />\nsometimes suffer for being thus unjust. Not every newspaper man can say to<br />\nhimself, \"this is my game and here goes for it.\" The personal feeling with<br />\nwhich a chemist watches the development of a discovery, a merchant the<br />\ngrowth of his business, or an engineer the fulfilment of his plans is not possible<br />\nfor the private in the newspaper army.<br />\nVery often\u2014ever so often\u2014the newspaper man is a spasmodic purveyor to<br />\na literary mince-pie of daily bake. \"Ah, hut the cook!\" you say,``The cook's<br />\nthe thing!\" And it's true. The cook is the editor or the publisher. Some.<br />\ntimes he's both. He inspects the citrons, the raisins and the meat, the lard<br />\nand the flour, throws out the specked, the rancid, the mouldy, and the taste<br />\nless, mixes the rest as he thinks they ought to go, rolls the pastry and meas<br />\nures in the mince meat, makes the pie, bakes it\u2014and takes the profits of the<br />\nsale. The cook is the craft that weathered the whirlpool. These similes are<br />\nnot more mixed than the mince-meat in the pie. The real newspaper man be-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE N EWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ncomes the cook, or at least, the meat-mixer or the pastry maker. A great many<br />\nSpecial qualities fit him for the post\u2014and nearly always he is deeply penetrated by a conviction of the dignity of making mince pies. The real newspaper man really loves his calling, comes back to it every day with a freshened<br />\nmind to see the large things which he can make his own, starts movemen<br />\na<br />\nt or<br />\nenters a fight as one of the parties to it, will make The Paper's enemies his own<br />\non sight, will toil in all circumstances personall<br />\ny and impersonally to increase<br />\nits fame. He could no more be a great teacher, physician<br />\n, merchant, engineer, or<br />\nsomething else, perhaps, than any of these could be a first-class newspaper<br />\nman, but this doesn't worry him at all. There are large rewards and dignities<br />\nin the newspaper business, but most<br />\nof them are for real newspaper men. The<br />\nreturns which come to a man who is in such work but doesn't belong there<br />\nare unspeakably smaller than those which the same industry,<br />\nintelligence, and<br />\nfair purposes would win him in almost any other business. Many<br />\nof us in the<br />\nnewspaper business are not real newspaper men\u2014many of us can compete no<br />\nbetter with those who are than a chicken can swim a duck across a mill-pond.<br />\nThe total of the qualities which distinguish a real newspape man<br />\nr<br />\nare easier to<br />\nsee and feel than to state. Those who have them will probably know<br />\nit. A<br />\ngrown man, if he ponders the thing, ought not to mistake \"glamor\" and<br />\n((<br />\ngraft\" for a real call to the newspaper business. Preach, teach, or sell snuff,<br />\nbe physicians or coffin-makers, engineers or anything<br />\nelse you are qualified to<br />\ndo well or to be properly. Dig the \"glamor\" out<br />\nof your eye and the \"graft\"<br />\nout of your soul whenever they afflict you. Think well unless you have<br />\na<br />\nmagazine of illusions to last a lifetime, or unless\u2014\"Don't do it.\"<br />\n<br />\nMARSHALL BALLARD, '98.<br />\nTHE COLLEGE CONVENTION.<br />\nT the sixteenth annual convention of the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle West and Maryland, held in this city<br />\nduring the Thanksgiving vacation, Dr. Remsen was elected president,<br />\nafter delivering the address of welcome.

The plan<br />\nproposed is similar to the course of the football management last fall,<br />\nwhich sold season tickets at a reduced rate. The writer does not state just how<br />\n\"The Powers that Be\" are to show their displeasure to delinquents; but it is<br />\ntrue indeed that a greater sense of obligation should prevail among the student<br />\nbody concerning attendance at 'Varsity games.<br />\n4 4ZIIE right kind of spirit\" is the best commentary on this year's football<br />\nteam, as it should be the best motto for all future teams. Probably<br />\nnever in the entire history of Hopkins' uphill athletic struggles did she<br />\nstart the football season with a more hopeless outlook. It is to the light and<br />\nmostly inexperienced men, who came out and worked in the face of all discouragement for the first three weeks, that we owe the creditable showing that<br />\nbegan with the Western Maryland game and was kept up for the rest of the<br />\nseason. There are two kinds of colleges where football succeeds: the big university whose previous athletic reputation serves to draw to her the stars of the<br />\nprep-school teams; and the small compact college, where an enthusiasm exists<br />\nwhich brings out to practice every man in the college who is physically sound,<br />\nwhether or not he is a football player by weight or inclination. Hopkins, by<br />\nher peculiar conditions, which deprive her of the services of the bulk of her<br />\ngraduate and medical students, and leave the burden of athletics upon an un-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\ndergraduate body amounting to less than one-third of her total enrollment<br />\ncan<br />\nhonor<br />\nmust naturally fall under this second category. And her athletic<br />\nonly be maintained by the same pluck and enthusiasm which has snatched<br />\nvictory from despair this fall. \"Well done!\"<br />\nHE cheering and singing during the football season past has shown some<br />\ncurious features. In the first place, there has been unusual activity in<br />\nthe -writing of new songs and yells. Dozens of suggestions have been made<br />\nfor parodies on airs of the day, some of which have proved very taking, while<br />\nat one time it seemed as if every undergraduate was proposing a yell that he<br />\nhad written\u2014or stolen. But, on the other hand, there have not been enough<br />\ncarry<br />\nrooters, except, strangely enough, at the one game played out of town, to<br />\nafof<br />\nstate<br />\nthis<br />\nfor<br />\nremedy<br />\nout successfully the wealth of ideas. A proposed<br />\nmaterial,<br />\nnew<br />\nof<br />\nsuggestion<br />\nfairs is found in another column. As regards the<br />\nit has been borne in upon the minds of those who were privileged to examine<br />\nthese late productions, that a little originality would give a great deal of help.<br />\nIt seems astonishing that among the hundreds of presumably fertile and ready<br />\nminds that feed so eagerly at the mental pastures offered by our University,<br />\nnot one can be found to suggest a combination of \"Rahs\" or other war-cries<br />\nthat will be at once novel and euphonious. It is just as astonishing that the<br />\nclub, or<br />\nproduction of catchy and suitable songs for the side lines, the glee<br />\na good<br />\nis<br />\nInterest<br />\nthe keg\u2014party should average no more than one per annum.<br />\nthe<br />\nhalf<br />\nand<br />\nform<br />\nthe<br />\nthing; but the kind of interest that is satisfied at cribbing<br />\nkind<br />\nthe<br />\nis<br />\nas<br />\nsubstance of six yells used by other colleges is not as welcome<br />\nthat thinks out a little something on its own account. If the good work goes<br />\nadhere<br />\non, with the object always in mind that it is far from necessary to<br />\nhave a<br />\nwill<br />\nwe<br />\nstrictly to precedent in the composition of cheers and songs,<br />\naround.<br />\ncome<br />\nfine collection of \"novelties\" when the track and lacrosse seasons<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nTo the -Editor of THE NEWS- LETTER:<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014One does not know the healthful influence exerted upon a<br />\nteam when it hears itself cheered and urged on to victory by a large number of<br />\nvoices; one does not appreciate the fact that there is an increased ability to<br />\nplay when the effects of this cheering are felt. But as long as separate tickets<br />\nare sold for each football or lacrosse game, there will always .he someone who<br />\nwill find an excuse not to be present. This fact is recognized at other universities, such as Cornell, Pennsylvania, etc. The question may then arise, perhaps, in what way can this difficulty be overcome and obviated? To obtain a<br />\nsolution, nothing more is necessary than to take example from the practice of those universities mentioned above. There it is obligatory for every<br />\nmember of the university to purchase a book which contains tickets not only<br />\nfor every football game, but also for every other exhibition in any way connected with athletic sports. If any student refuses to purchase one of these<br />\nbooks, unless for the best of excuses, he is strongly made to feel the displeasure<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTE:R.<br />\n<br />\nof \"the powers that be.\" Under this method of procedure, there is a highly<br />\nsuccessful attendance at all games, for it is human nature that after a person<br />\nhas purchased a ticket of admittance to a game, he will make use of it, unless<br />\na very good reason prevents.<br />\nThis plan of issuing books cannot cause a slimmer attendance than we<br />\nhave had at some games, and, on the other hand, it is possible that it might be<br />\nproductive of much good. In view of this, the writer would like to propose<br />\nthat consideration of such a step be invited in THE NEWS-LETTER, so that the<br />\nviews of the student body at large may he obtained.<br />\nG. 13.

Twice, when the Black and Blue goal was in<br />\nimminent danger, the light line stood like a stone wall, and each time the ball<br />\nwas gained on downs,<br />\nThe University of Maryland kicked off to Strohbar, who advanced the ball<br />\n10 yards. Hopkins then rushed the doctors' line for 10 more yards, but the<br />\nball went to Maryland on downs. They steadily advanced, by end runs and<br />\nline plunges, until dangerously near the Hopkins go al. Encouraged by the<br />\n\"faithful,\" with their yell of \"Hold them, Hopkins!\" the team took a brace<br />\nand recovered the ball on downs.<br />\nDespite the fact that Maryland again obtained the ball on our 5.yard line,<br />\nwe again held the doctors for downs.

THE FABLE OF 'ME F001, AND HIS MONF.Y.<br />\nHERE was once a college youth who had a friend who knew a lot about the<br />\nlaws of chance. Only he called his system a \"sure thing.\" There was<br />\nnever a race or a ball game when he did not know which way the money<br />\nought to be placed. On the day of the great game, the college youth came up<br />\nto him and requested a few pointers on the result. He said that he was slightly<br />\nafraid to put up his money, as the other college had a good team. The man<br />\nwho knew a lot about the laws of chance looked wise but said nothing. The<br />\nother college had barrels of money and they began to lather the field with it,<br />\nfinally offering large odds for the purpose of catching the suckers whom a wise<br />\nlaw of nature provides for the people who know just what to do to a good thing.<br />\nThe college youth ran breathlessly over to the friend who knew a lot about<br />\nthe laws of chance and told him that the other fellows were offering odds of 3 to<br />\n1. He asked for advice. As he talked the odds jumped up to 5 to 1. The man<br />\nwho knew listened in silence. At last he realized that the college youth was<br />\ngoing to get reckless no matter what he said, so he proceeded to give a few bits<br />\nof oracular advice.<br />\n\"My friend,\" quoth he, \"a fool and his money are soon ifarted.

But instead of getting their money at big odds they have wiped<br />\nme off the map.\"<br />\n\"I did tell you that a fool and his money are soon parted,\" said the wise<br />\nguy, \"but you did not realize that you were the fool.\"<br />\nMORAL: This fable teaches freshmen that there are always two points of<br />\nview.<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nP4N.<br />\n<br />\nRNGES<br />\nOur Exchange Editor was shocked at receiving a copy of the McGill Outlook<br />\naddressed to `I NEWS LETTER, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,<br />\nOhio,\"<br />\nfrom which place it had been forwarded here.

I read 'Charley\" Bump's name<br />\nunder that piece of advice with a little surprise. Knowing him for so good a<br />\nnewspaper man as he is, I might fairly have expected him to be even a little<br />\nenthusiastic on the other side. He feels toward his business, however, as many<br />\nof the men do who have come to know any part of it with any intimacy. The<br />\nnewspaper business isn't a good thing for anybody unless it is a good thing<br />\nThat's equally true of any other business,\" you reply And so it is. But<br />\nthe newspaper business is overcrowded with men who are misplaced in it as<br />\nmuch as second story men in the sanctuary. The sanctuary, indeed, is supplied with many excellent priests. Newspaper men of the first class, I believe,<br />\nare not nearly so common in the newspaper business.<br />\nA graduate student of Dr. Ames' department probably expressed the chief<br />\nreason for this a few nights ago. \"Ah,\" he said to me, \"but there's a glamor<br />\nabout a newspaper man's life!\" I've heard this so often that I'm beginning to<br />\nbelieve it. There is a tremendous \"glamor about the newspaper man's life.\"<br />\nMost of the 'glamor\" lies in the observer's eye. It doesn't do the newspaper<br />\nman any harm if he is sensible, but it may lead the observer to make a fool of<br />\nhimself. \"Glamor\" is just the whirlpool for the college fellow whose anchor<br />\nisn't out\u2014sometimes it is strong enough to make one drag his anchor. A few<br />\nsuch craft are built for this sort of stress\u2014they drive with the swirl to its<br />\nroughest place and its speed increases their momentum; they don't last their<br />\nfull span, hut while their timbers hold they win a jolly struggle with the<br />\nstorm as others go down about them. Some beat ground and escape the whirl\u2014<br />\nafter learning enough seamanship to keep in the quiet water. Some are dis<br />\nmantled after a long fight and are thrown out without machinery or canvas<br />\ninto the open ocean\u2014derelicts. In a limited prospect, I have seen fleets of all<br />\nthese three kinds of newspaper craft.<br />\nToo many of the unfit enter the newspaper business They know a reporter who says, \"Hello, Jack!\" to a Congressman, exchanges small talk with<br />\na bishop, confers confidentially with the marshal of police, fills free seats in<br />\ntheatres, enjoys the privilege of getting drenched under the walls of a burning<br />\nwarehouse, wades in Wood at every murder, gets mysterious communications<br />\nfrom bartenders and hackmen, drinks champagne occasionally and smokes<br />\nCigars for which he doesn't pay, and then calls on the president of a woman's<br />\ncollege. This is a first-class \"glamor\" outfit. Of course, coming one after the<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nother, the Congressman, the bishop, the marshal, the bartender, the blood and<br />\nfire and water and all the rest,\u2014they have the diverting effect of novelties.<br />\nBut, then, the repetition of diversity is monotony itself. It is true that the reporter may make useful friends among those he meets. It is also true that<br />\nmost of the people he visits are not aggressively glad to see him unless they<br />\nwant something and, perhaps, have sent for him. With equal truth the report\u2022<br />\nthing<br />\ner may make enemies\u2014and he sometimes does. Here is an exasperating<br />\nhis<br />\nin<br />\nnot<br />\nhim,<br />\nto<br />\ncome<br />\nThey<br />\nincurs:<br />\nhe<br />\nenmities<br />\nabout a great many of the<br />\nsome<br />\nlike<br />\nlife,<br />\nnewspaper<br />\nof<br />\n\"glamor\"<br />\nThe<br />\nown fight, but in \"The Paper's.\"<br />\nother intangible things, dissipates rather easily. Beyond the \"glamor\" of it,<br />\nin the diversity of the reporter's side of it, there is as much bodily exhaustion<br />\nand brain-fag as elsewhere; very often a great deal more than elsewhere.<br />\nCharley Bump repeats several times that the young man's \"world-illumining volume\" will never be written if he remains a conscientious newspaper man.<br />\n\"Why, that fellow must be buggy,\" I heard a freshman say, \"everybody<br />\nknows that Dickens was a reporter.\" If this boy ever comes to read the brief<br />\nest of the obituary \"notices\" he will learn that reporters pass away with the<br />\nsame regularity as millionaires, and when he has read all the longest of \"the<br />\ngreatest of recent novels\" he will understand that hundreds of thousands of<br />\nnewspaper men died during the nineteenth century, but in all that time God<br />\nmade only one Dickens. All this, however, is where the \"glamor\" used to be\u2014<br />\nin my eye. Never having coddled an ambition to \"illumine\" the \"world\"<br />\nby a \"volume,\" I feel no sting in not being able to do so. But I distrust the<br />\nnewspaper business on grounds both sentimental and commercial\u2014not for<br />\neverybody, understand, but for myself and the majority who, I believe, are<br />\nlike me.<br />\nTo spend your life in telling what other people are doing seems an empty<br />\npursuit. Yet an army of conscientious and industrious newspaper workers are<br />\nbusy at it. Let them become deeply interested in the great movements, the<br />\nlarge causes, with which they deal, and they warp their chronicle If they<br />\ntake sides, someone claims they have done him an injustice\u2014some of them<br />\nsometimes suffer for being thus unjust. Not every newspaper man can say to<br />\nhimself, \"this is my game and here goes for it.\" The personal feeling with<br />\nwhich a chemist watches the development of a discovery, a merchant the<br />\ngrowth of his business, or an engineer the fulfilment of his plans is not possible<br />\nfor the private in the newspaper army.<br />\nVery often\u2014ever so often\u2014the newspaper man is a spasmodic purveyor to<br />\na literary mince-pie of daily bake. \"Ah, hut the cook!\" you say,``The cook's<br />\nthe thing!\" And it's true. The cook is the editor or the publisher. Some.<br />\ntimes he's both. He inspects the citrons, the raisins and the meat, the lard<br />\nand the flour, throws out the specked, the rancid, the mouldy, and the taste<br />\nless, mixes the rest as he thinks they ought to go, rolls the pastry and meas<br />\nures in the mince meat, makes the pie, bakes it\u2014and takes the profits of the<br />\nsale. The cook is the craft that weathered the whirlpool. These similes are<br />\nnot more mixed than the mince-meat in the pie. The real newspaper man be-<br /><br />\nTHE N EWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\ncomes the cook, or at least, the meat-mixer or the pastry maker. A great many<br />\nSpecial qualities fit him for the post\u2014and nearly always he is deeply penetrated by a conviction of the dignity of making mince pies. The real newspaper man really loves his calling, comes back to it every day with a freshened<br />\nmind to see the large things which he can make his own, starts movemen<br />\na<br />\nt or<br />\nenters a fight as one of the parties to it, will make The Paper's enemies his own<br />\non sight, will toil in all circumstances personall<br />\ny and impersonally to increase<br />\nits fame. He could no more be a great teacher, physician<br />\n, merchant, engineer, or<br />\nsomething else, perhaps, than any of these could be a first-class newspaper<br />\nman, but this doesn't worry him at all. There are large rewards and dignities<br />\nin the newspaper business, but most<br />\nof them are for real newspaper men. The<br />\nreturns which come to a man who is in such work but doesn't belong there<br />\nare unspeakably smaller than those which the same industry,<br />\nintelligence, and<br />\nfair purposes would win him in almost any other business. Many<br />\nof us in the<br />\nnewspaper business are not real newspaper men\u2014many of us can compete no<br />\nbetter with those who are than a chicken can swim a duck across a mill-pond.<br />\nThe total of the qualities which distinguish a real newspape man<br />\nr<br />\nare easier to<br />\nsee and feel than to state. Those who have them will probably know<br />\nit. A<br />\ngrown man, if he ponders the thing, ought not to mistake \"glamor\" and<br />\n((<br />\ngraft\" for a real call to the newspaper business. Preach, teach, or sell snuff,<br />\nbe physicians or coffin-makers, engineers or anything<br />\nelse you are qualified to<br />\ndo well or to be properly.

The plan<br />\nproposed is similar to the course of the football management last fall,<br />\nwhich sold season tickets at a reduced rate. The writer does not state just how<br />\n\"The Powers that Be\" are to show their displeasure to delinquents; but it is<br />\ntrue indeed that a greater sense of obligation should prevail among the student<br />\nbody concerning attendance at 'Varsity games.<br />\n4 4ZIIE right kind of spirit\" is the best commentary on this year's football<br />\nteam, as it should be the best motto for all future teams. Probably<br />\nnever in the entire history of Hopkins' uphill athletic struggles did she<br />\nstart the football season with a more hopeless outlook. It is to the light and<br />\nmostly inexperienced men, who came out and worked in the face of all discouragement for the first three weeks, that we owe the creditable showing that<br />\nbegan with the Western Maryland game and was kept up for the rest of the<br />\nseason. There are two kinds of colleges where football succeeds: the big university whose previous athletic reputation serves to draw to her the stars of the<br />\nprep-school teams; and the small compact college, where an enthusiasm exists<br />\nwhich brings out to practice every man in the college who is physically sound,<br />\nwhether or not he is a football player by weight or inclination. Hopkins, by<br />\nher peculiar conditions, which deprive her of the services of the bulk of her<br />\ngraduate and medical students, and leave the burden of athletics upon an un-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n,<br />\ndergraduate body amounting to less than one-third of her total enrollment<br />\ncan<br />\nhonor<br />\nmust naturally fall under this second category. And her athletic<br />\nonly be maintained by the same pluck and enthusiasm which has snatched<br />\nvictory from despair this fall. \"Well done!\"<br />\nHE cheering and singing during the football season past has shown some<br />\ncurious features. In the first place, there has been unusual activity in<br />\nthe -writing of new songs and yells. Dozens of suggestions have been made<br />\nfor parodies on airs of the day, some of which have proved very taking, while<br />\nat one time it seemed as if every undergraduate was proposing a yell that he<br />\nhad written\u2014or stolen. But, on the other hand, there have not been enough<br />\ncarry<br />\nrooters, except, strangely enough, at the one game played out of town, to<br />\nafof<br />\nstate<br />\nthis<br />\nfor<br />\nremedy<br />\nout successfully the wealth of ideas. A proposed<br />\nmaterial,<br />\nnew<br />\nof<br />\nsuggestion<br />\nfairs is found in another column. As regards the<br />\nit has been borne in upon the minds of those who were privileged to examine<br />\nthese late productions, that a little originality would give a great deal of help.<br />\nIt seems astonishing that among the hundreds of presumably fertile and ready<br />\nminds that feed so eagerly at the mental pastures offered by our University,<br />\nnot one can be found to suggest a combination of \"Rahs\" or other war-cries<br />\nthat will be at once novel and euphonious. It is just as astonishing that the<br />\nclub, or<br />\nproduction of catchy and suitable songs for the side lines, the glee<br />\na good<br />\nis<br />\nInterest<br />\nthe keg\u2014party should average no more than one per annum.<br />\nthe<br />\nhalf<br />\nand<br />\nform<br />\nthe<br />\nthing; but the kind of interest that is satisfied at cribbing<br />\nkind<br />\nthe<br />\nis<br />\nas<br />\nsubstance of six yells used by other colleges is not as welcome<br />\nthat thinks out a little something on its own account. If the good work goes<br />\nadhere<br />\non, with the object always in mind that it is far from necessary to<br />\nhave a<br />\nwill<br />\nwe<br />\nstrictly to precedent in the composition of cheers and songs,<br />\naround.<br />\ncome<br />\nfine collection of \"novelties\" when the track and lacrosse seasons<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nTo the -Editor of THE NEWS- LETTER:<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014One does not know the healthful influence exerted upon a<br />\nteam when it hears itself cheered and urged on to victory by a large number of<br />\nvoices; one does not appreciate the fact that there is an increased ability to<br />\nplay when the effects of this cheering are felt. But as long as separate tickets<br />\nare sold for each football or lacrosse game, there will always .he someone who<br />\nwill find an excuse not to be present. This fact is recognized at other universities, such as Cornell, Pennsylvania, etc. The question may then arise, perhaps, in what way can this difficulty be overcome and obviated? To obtain a<br />\nsolution, nothing more is necessary than to take example from the practice of those universities mentioned above. There it is obligatory for every<br />\nmember of the university to purchase a book which contains tickets not only<br />\nfor every football game, but also for every other exhibition in any way connected with athletic sports. If any student refuses to purchase one of these<br />\nbooks, unless for the best of excuses, he is strongly made to feel the displeasure<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTE:R.<br /><br />\nof \"the powers that be.\" Under this method of procedure, there is a highly<br />\nsuccessful attendance at all games, for it is human nature that after a person<br />\nhas purchased a ticket of admittance to a game, he will make use of it, unless<br />\na very good reason prevents.<br />\nThis plan of issuing books cannot cause a slimmer attendance than we<br />\nhave had at some games, and, on the other hand, it is possible that it might be<br />\nproductive of much good. In view of this, the writer would like to propose<br />\nthat consideration of such a step be invited in THE NEWS-LETTER, so that the<br />\nviews of the student body at large may he obtained.<br />\nG. 13.

Twice, when the Black and Blue goal was in<br />\nimminent danger, the light line stood like a stone wall, and each time the ball<br />\nwas gained on downs,<br />\nThe University of Maryland kicked off to Strohbar, who advanced the ball<br />\n10 yards. Hopkins then rushed the doctors' line for 10 more yards, but the<br />\nball went to Maryland on downs. They steadily advanced, by end runs and<br />\nline plunges, until dangerously near the Hopkins go al. Encouraged by the<br />\n\"faithful,\" with their yell of \"Hold them, Hopkins!\" the team took a brace<br />\nand recovered the ball on downs.<br />\nDespite the fact that Maryland again obtained the ball on our 5.yard line,<br />\nwe again held the doctors for downs. Yearly and Kellum, especially, figured<br />\nin this splendid stand.<br />\nHopkins now did some grand-stand playing. The plunges by Blanck and<br />\nWilbur advanced the ball 20 yards. A minute later, Houghton made the star<br />\nplay of the game by a beautiful run of 45 yards around left end. Coffee was<br />\nthe only man between Houghton and the doctors' goal, and, for a minute,<br />\nvisions of a touchdown floated before the eyes of the Hopkins adherents.<br />\nMiller then went around right end for 8 yards, and Blanck was pushed<br />\nthrough the line several times until the ball was on Maryland's 4-yard line.<br />\nEverything seemed to be coming Hopkins way at this point, and the rooters<br />\nsang for a \"Touchdown, Touchdown,\" but an unlucky fumble lost the ball,<br />\nand it was punted out of danger.<br />\n.<br />\nHopkins kicked off in the second half. In spite of heroic efforts, we<br />\nwere unable to prevent Maryland from scoring a touchdown, since the left side<br />\nof our line was by no means impregnable. Several times the ball had been<br />\nbrought back by the referee after it had been taken across the Hopkins side<br />\nline, because Maryland had gone out of bounds, Griffin failed to kick goal.<br />\nA few minutes later, the game ended with the ball in Hopkins' possession<br />\nabout the middle of the field.<br />\nThe game was fiercely contested from beginning to end.

The end runs<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nby Houghton and Iseman set the rooters wild, and the line plunges of Blanck<br />\nand Wilbur were always effective.

But at this crucial point, a fumble<br />\nwas made, and M. A. C. secured the ball.

THE FABLE OF 'ME F001, AND HIS MONF.Y.<br />\nHERE was once a college youth who had a friend who knew a lot about the<br />\nlaws of chance. Only he called his system a \"sure thing.\" There was<br />\nnever a race or a ball game when he did not know which way the money<br />\nought to be placed. On the day of the great game, the college youth came up<br />\nto him and requested a few pointers on the result. He said that he was slightly<br />\nafraid to put up his money, as the other college had a good team. The man<br />\nwho knew a lot about the laws of chance looked wise but said nothing. The<br />\nother college had barrels of money and they began to lather the field with it,<br />\nfinally offering large odds for the purpose of catching the suckers whom a wise<br />\nlaw of nature provides for the people who know just what to do to a good thing.<br />\nThe college youth ran breathlessly over to the friend who knew a lot about<br />\nthe laws of chance and told him that the other fellows were offering odds of 3 to<br />\n1. He asked for advice. As he talked the odds jumped up to 5 to 1. The man<br />\nwho knew listened in silence. At last he realized that the college youth was<br />\ngoing to get reckless no matter what he said, so he proceeded to give a few bits<br />\nof oracular advice.<br />\n\"My friend,\" quoth he, \"a fool and his money are soon ifarted. I guess<br />\nyou had better place all you have on the result at the best odds that you can get.\"<br />\nThe young man went away joyfully and let them separate him from his roll.<br />\nThe next day he met the man who knew a lot about the laws of chance,<br />\nand his sorrowful countenance betrayed deep emotion.<br />\n\"Friend,\" he said, \"you have played me false. I asked you as a friend to<br />\ntell me how to place my money, and you told me that a fool and his money are<br />\nsoon parted. But instead of getting their money at big odds they have wiped<br />\nme off the map.\"<br />\n\"I did tell you that a fool and his money are soon parted,\" said the wise<br />\nguy, \"but you did not realize that you were the fool.\"<br />\nMORAL: This fable teaches freshmen that there are always two points of<br />\nview.<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nP4N.<br /><br />\nRNGES<br />\nOur Exchange Editor was shocked at receiving a copy of the McGill Outlook<br />\naddressed to `I NEWS LETTER, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,<br />\nOhio,\"<br />\nfrom which place it had been forwarded here.
