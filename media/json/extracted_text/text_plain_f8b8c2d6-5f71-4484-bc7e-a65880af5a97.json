This,<br />\nhowever, is far from the case.<br />\nNot only do responsibilities among the various committees overlap (as in the case of the controversy over housing next year's<br />\nundergraduate women), but several committees have been rendered<br />\nineffective from lack of appointments, While others have never<br />\nhad it made clear to whom they<br />\nare to report.<br />\nA case in point is the Homewood Campus Traffic and Parking<br />\nCommittee. The committee, according to its chairman, Dr. Carl<br />\nF. Christ, is theoretically responsible to the President, although<br />\nall of its recommendations are<br />\nactually ,implemented by the Director of Business Services. Its<br />\ncharge states that the committee<br />\nis to \"make recommendations...<br />\nand that these recommendations<br />\nshall be automatically implemented except where they require approval of the President of appro-<br />\n<br />\npriation of funds.\" The committee<br />\nhas neither a budget nor 'power<br />\nover allocations.<br />\n\"We can make minor recommendations,\" Christ said, \"like rearranging parking spaces or determining the length of time in which<br />\none Can appeal a ticket.\" It has<br />\nno real say any more in the proposed parking garage, which is<br />\nnow tied up in high-level discussions. The committee was involved<br />\nin preliminary planning, but has<br />\ndeferred or been excluded from<br />\nrecent decisions, including whether or not a fee should be charged for on-campus parking.<br />\nThe Bookstore Committee<br />\nhas met only twice this year.<br />\nDean Robert Strider, chairman of<br />\nthe committee, described its purpose as \"looking both ways\"\u2014a<br />\ndiscussion of past finances and of<br />\nfuture plans. \"The Center is currently losing money,\" he said,<br />\n\"although it is presently operating<br />\nmore efficiently than before.\"<br />\nAsked about the possibility<br />\nof a co-op on campus, Strider<br />\nstated that the question had not<br />\n(continued on p. 4)<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMarch 6, 1970<br />\n<br />\nBrinkley Says Hopkins Poor Trash Collection<br />\nMust Change Its Image Blamed for Rat Crisis<br />\nDistressed about the homogeneity of<br />\nthe undergraduate student body at Hopkins, William Brinkley, Director of Undergraduate Admissions, said that the<br />\nimage Hopkins portrays must be changed.<br />\n\"We need more variety in our applicants,\" Brinkley noted. \"We get a group<br />\nof applicants that look too darn much<br />\nalike and are to science-oriented.\"<br />\nBrinkley stated that the University<br />\nwas doing what it could to change this<br />\nestablished image.Unfortunately,Brinkley noted that there was little that could<br />\nbe done outside of the various university<br />\npublications which are periodically sent<br />\nto alumni, parents and high schools<br />\naround the country.<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's rat problem was the subject of an AWARE meeting last Tuesday<br />\nnight.<br />\nThere are an estimated one million<br />\nrats in Baltimore City, according to<br />\nBlaine Taylor, who spoke at the meeting.<br />\nTaylor is a student at TowsonState College, and a Democratic candidate for the<br />\nState Senate in 1974. The estimated one<br />\nhundred million rats in the United States<br />\ncause approximatly one billion dollars<br />\ndamage yearly, said Taylor.<br />\nTaylor implied that public ignorance<br />\nof the rat problem hampered efforts to<br />\ndeal with it. \"Right now, in the city of<br />\nBaltimore, not far from here, children<br />\ngo to bed at night with rats in their cribs<br />\ninstead of teddy bears,\" observed Taylor.<br />\n<br />\nLittle Progress<br />\n\"I don't see very much progress,<br />\nespecially when science things attract<br />\nthe news media the way they do today\",<br />\nsaid Brinkley. \"We've been plugging<br />\naway at changing this for three years.\"<br />\nBrinkley said that he would like to see<br />\nmany more humanities-oriented students<br />\napply for admission to Hopkins. He did<br />\nmention that, although he feels there are<br />\nmany good courses in the humanities<br />\noffered to undergraduates, he wuld like<br />\nto see more of them offered to freshmen.<br />\nThis is important asserted Brinkley,<br />\nboth for the freshmen who would benefit<br />\nby such a change and for the University<br />\nas a whole in attracting more candidates with interests outside the sciences.<br />\nSo far, there have been 2431 applications<br />\nsubmitted for next year's freshmen class.<br />\nThis represents a 12% decrease in the<br />\nnumber of applicants from last year.<br />\nThis figure, however, is about the same<br />\nas that for 1968.<br />\nBrinkley noted that many other schools<br />\naround the East have also experienced a<br />\ndecline of about 12% in the number of<br />\n<br />\nWilliam Brinkley, Director of Admissions:<br />\n\"We need a variety in our applicants.\"<br />\napplications received this year. Brinkley said that his theory and the theory<br />\nof other admissions directors around the<br />\nEast is that this decrease is the result<br />\nof their high tuition costs in a year of<br />\ntight money.<br />\nAs of Tuesday, the admissions office<br />\nhad received applications from 31 women seeking admission into next year's<br />\nfreshmen class. The University also has<br />\nreceived 38 female transfer applications<br />\nof which 23 have been accepted. The<br />\nUniversity had originally planned to accept 50 women transfer students for the<br />\ncoming academic year. Only women who<br />\nare residents of Baltimore and who will<br />\nbe living at home next year will be considered for admission into next year's<br />\nfreshmen class.<br />\n165 black men and 6 black women are<br />\namong the 2431 freshmen applicants. 7<br />\nof the 50 male transfer applicants are<br />\nblack. There are presently 2 black female transfer applicants.<br />\n<br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\n<br />\nAside from the economic and psychological damage caused by rats, they are<br />\nalso disease carriers. Among the diseases that are spread by rats are bubonic plague, rabies, jaundice and rickets, Taylor noted.<br />\n<br />\nBaby's Lips<br />\nTaylor stated that there were over a<br />\nquarter of a million reported rat bites<br />\nin the U.S. in 1967. He emphasized that<br />\nbabies and young children were most<br />\nsusceptible to rat bites. If a baby is left<br />\nin a crib with a bottle, the milk will dry<br />\non his lips, and a rat may smell it.<br />\nThe rat will then climb into the crib and<br />\ngnaw the baby's lips.<br />\nGarbage is the main source of food<br />\nfor rats, said Taylor. \"One of the main<br />\nreasons there are more rats in the ghetto<br />\nthan in any other place is because of poor<br />\ngarbage collection,\" he commented. He<br />\nclaimed that this was due to the absence<br />\nof any registered white voters in the<br />\nghetto area.<br />\nHowever, the rat problem is now<br />\n<br />\nVisiting Baltimore?

This week is designated as a<br />\ntime of concerted pressure on both local draft boards<br />\nand Internal Revenue centers in the form of demonstrations and civil disobedience.<br />\nLipman's plans for this period depend almost entirely<br />\non the general response to the \"We Won't Go\" petition<br />\nand the activities of End the Draft week. They range<br />\nin scope from a \"march into the center of the city\" to<br />\nrallies on campus.<br />\n<br />\nBy MIKE MacADAMS<br />\nAccording to ACLU attorney, William Zinman, anyone<br />\nsigning the New Mobilization Committee's \"We Won't<br />\nGo\" petition now being circulated on campus runs the<br />\n\"risk\" of prosecution for conspiracy to violate the draft<br />\nlaws,<br />\nHowever, Mr. Zinman continued, it is \"highly unlikely<br />\nthat anyone would be, though, the Justice Department<br />\ncould take a contrary view.\" In any event, he cautioned,<br />\nthe petition \"scrapes pretty close to the line\" between<br />\ntheoretical and practical illegality.<br />\nPart of the New Mobe's March 16-22 National End<br />\nthe Draft Week, the petition will be distributed on the<br />\nHomewood campus by the Peace Action Committee<br />\n(PAC) of the S.A. Cabinet, beginning Monday, March 9.<br />\n(See Page 12)<br />\n<br />\nCampus Petition<br />\nAccording to George Lipman, who heads the PAC at<br />\nHopkins, the petition is only one facet of the participation scheduled locally during that week.<br />\nDuring the Draft Week itself, Lipman has arranged<br />\nfor Cao Ngoc Phuong, a former Saigon University professor and leader in several underground Vietnamese<br />\norganizations, to speak at Shriver on March 19, Miss<br />\nCao, Lipman said, is an authority on the American<br />\npolitical and Vietnamization efforts in South Viet Nam.<br />\nIn addition, Lipman stated he hopes to discuss the possibility of rallies, teach-ins and, perhaps civil disobedience activities at Hopkins during an open meeting<br />\nto be held March 9 at Levering.<br />\nThe primary purpose of these endeavors, Lipman<br />\nstated, \"is to get people awake again\" and to help them<br />\n\"get themselves together.\" The petition, itself, Lipman sees as an opportunity to make a meaningful<br />\ncommitment to the peace effort on an individual level.<br />\nIn addition, the Levering-sponsored Draft counselling<br />\nprogram at Morgan State during the next three Saturdays and the programs planned during the next few<br />\nweeks will, Lipman commented, acquaint the student<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Lipman is head of the campus Peace Action Committee's<br />\nanti-draft petition which may place its signers in violation of the<br />\nlaw.<br />\nwith such developments as the current Laotian involvement and the failure of the Vietnamization Policy.<br />\nSecondly, Lipman noted, the activities of the week will<br />\nserve as a means to \"re-establish the sound community<br />\nties of October\" in order to form a firm organizational<br />\nstructure. This, Lipman stressed, is absolutely essentical to the success of the New Mobe's plans for the<br />\nfollowing months. With good organization, Lipman said,<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, Lipman asserted that he wants to persuade<br />\nas many students as possible to swamp their draft<br />\nboards with telephone calls and mail concerning any<br />\nsort of trivial information or questions. Individuals<br />\nare also encouraged to visit draft boards personally<br />\nand sustain long conversations or arguments with the<br />\nemployees there.<br />\nIn keeping with the theme of End War Taxes Week,<br />\nLipman plans to send troops of students laden with<br />\npamphlets to all H and R Block and Internal Revenue<br />\nCenters in an all-out propaganda campaign. Though<br />\nthese pamphlets will contain information pointing out<br />\nthe extent to which taxes go to the military rather than<br />\nto poverty or educational programs, their real purpose,<br />\nas in the case of the draft boards, is simply to create<br />\nas much havoc in the organization and execution of duties as is legally possible.<br />\nThe \"We Won't Go\" petitions will be distributed<br />\npersonally to all campus dorm residents. Those participating in the circulation there will be able to explain<br />\nfurther the legal implications involved in signing them.<br />\nTables will also be placed in Levering Dining Room<br />\nduring the afternoon where the petitions will le made<br />\nIndividuals having questions may consult<br />\navailable.<br />\nwith those distributing the petitions thee as well.<br />\n<br />\nGrad Students Hit Suspension at SAC Meeting<br />\n<br />\nBob Cotter (left) of the Appeals Board has accused during Wednesday's meeting Dr. John White.<br />\n(right) chairman of the Board, with inproper procedures concerning the suspension of an undergraduate caught stealing books.<br />\n<br />\nProtests against the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee's suspension of a student for<br />\nstealing books from the bookstore continued at the committee's Wednesday<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nSeveral graduate students attended the<br />\nmeeting in order to express their opposition to the suspension. Bob Cotter,<br />\nPresident of the Graduate Student Organization and a member of the SAC,<br />\na:rtempt to introduce a resolution calling for a retrial of the suspended student.<br />\nThe motion was ruled out of order by<br />\nDr. John White, Chairman of the Committee, because there exists no machinery for such a retrial. Any change in<br />\nthe decision, it was stated would have<br />\nto come from President Gordon. Following the decision last Friday, Cotter<br />\nsent a letter to Gordon asking that he<br />\nreverse the decision.<br />\nDr. Wickwire, who submitted a<br />\n<br />\nKennedy - King Lectures Postponed<br />\nthat according to Rudoy, \"seemed to<br />\nindicate that he would lecture at Hopkins.\"<br />\nWhen Kennedy declined again last<br />\nmonth, the lecture seemed doomed for<br />\nthe second year. Rudoy, however, noted that he has enlisted the Senator's aid<br />\nin finding a suitable substititute to initiate the lecture series. Possibilities<br />\ninclude Theodore Sorensen, Arthur Schlesinger and Kenneth Galbraith.<br />\nRudoy said a letter is expected within the week from the Senator's office,<br />\nsuggesting possible names and dates.<br />\nWith this information, the Student Council and the International Forum, which<br />\njointly sponsor the lectures, will be<br />\nable to form definite plans.<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council's Kennedy and<br />\nMartin Luther King Lecture Series has<br />\nbeen postponed until late spring or next<br />\nfall, due to a series of problems in the<br />\nscheduling of speakers.<br />\nDean Rudoy, chairman of the Kennedy<br />\nLecture Committee, promised that the<br />\nfirst of the speeches will be delivered<br />\nby May. He stated, however, that the<br />\nsecond King series has been postponed<br />\nindefinitely.<br />\nTentative plans for the First Annual<br />\nJohn F. and Robert F. Kennedy Memorial<br />\nLecture on International Affairs were to<br />\nfeature Senator Edward Kennedy. However, a charge in the Senator's schedule caused him to cancel out late last<br />\nmonth, Rudoy explained.<br />\n<br />\nNo Coretta King<br />\n<br />\nPast Kennedy Problems<br />\nThe organizers of the lecture, Dean<br />\nRudoy and Manuel Rodriguez, have been<br />\nworking on the project since the fall of<br />\n1968. Their first attempt to contact the<br />\nyounger Kennedy concerning an appearance met with failure. The Senator at that<br />\ntime said that he wished to devote his<br />\ntime to matters of government and was<br />\nforced to decline the invitation.<br />\n<br />\nDean Rudoy has tried for two years now in<br />\nvain to persuade Senator Edward Kennedy<br />\nto speak at the Kennedy Lecture series.<br />\nDuring the summer, Kennedy was<br />\nagain contacted by Rudoy, who requested a reconsideration of the refusal. The<br />\nStudent Council received several encouraging letters from the Senator's office<br />\n<br />\nThe other series, in honor of the late<br />\nMartin Luther King, have been put off<br />\nindefinitely because of the lack of a<br />\nspeaker for the inaugural address. Early<br />\nattempts to attract Mrs. Coretta King<br />\nwere unsuccessful. The Council awaits<br />\nthe outcome of renewed attempts by<br />\nchairman Chuck Fax and his committee to schedule a suitable speaker.<br />\n<br />\nminority report on the suspension issue,<br />\ndid not attend the meeting on Wednesday.<br />\nWickwire's report was supported by a<br />\nseparate letter signed by Cotter and<br />\nChris Ohly, a sophomore member of the<br />\nSAC, which was sent to Pres:dent Gordon.<br />\nAfter the meeting Cotter stated, \"I<br />\nfrankly think that White might be wrong<br />\n- about not being able to re-try it.\" Cotter,<br />\nwho said he had been in touch with a<br />\nlawyer about the matter, claimed that<br />\nthere was \"plenty of legal basis for retrying it.\"<br />\nAt the meeting, it was pointed out that<br />\nno allegations of irregularity were made<br />\nduring or immediately following the Appeals Board Trial. It was reported that<br />\nafter the decision was reached, the suspended student agreed that he had had a<br />\nfair trial.<br />\nJohn Ferchak, a graduate student,<br />\nwas present at the committee meeting<br />\nto \"protest the severity of the sentence<br />\nand the manner in which the matter was<br />\nhandled.\" He requested that the Committee publish a majority report clarifying the reasons for its decision. The<br />\ncommittee refused to do so, since the<br />\noriginal meeting had been closed at the<br />\nrequest of the suspended student.<br />\nFerchack pointed out that the Committee had published such a report when,<br />\nlast November, they overturned the suspension of three students involved in the<br />\nOctober Moratorium activities. Since<br />\nthat decision overturned suspensions enacted by the administration, Ferchack<br />\nclaimed that the committee was only interested in explaining decision to the<br />\nadministration, and did not care about<br />\nexplanations to students.<br />\nFer 'hack is a past member of the<br />\nSAC, and was responsible for introducing the original motion on discipline.<br />\nJill Fankhauser, also a graduate student, attended the meeting because she<br />\n\"thought there was an injustice done to<br />\nthe student.\" She went on to say that she<br />\n\"suspected that the committee was rigid,<br />\nand she wanted to argue for reconciliation.\" Her husband David, also at the<br />\nmeeting, stated that the \"Committee is<br />\nso uptight about institutions that they lose<br />\nsight of human values.\" He described<br />\nthe SAC as a \"buffer\" for President<br />\nGordon.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nConfusion Surrounds CommitteeSystem<br />\n(continued from p. 1)<br />\ncome up.<br />\nWilliam Kaiser, a graduate student,is<br />\nalso on the committee,and he claimed that<br />\nhe personally had brought up the co-op<br />\nidea, as well as the possibility of bringing<br />\nin an outside firm to run the Center. He<br />\ncontended that both were voted down<br />\nbecause \"no one knew how they worked.<br />\nThere was also the fear that the Bookstore would lose its 'academic flavor'<br />\nif it were taken over by a profit-conscious enterprise.\"<br />\nThe members stated that they were<br />\nnot sure why the committee met so infrequently, said Kaiser. \"There must be<br />\nsome kind of provision to petition to have<br />\na meeting, but we haven't done it.<br />\nThe ten-month-old Student Relations<br />\nCommittee has not met once during the<br />\n'69-'70 academic year. Dr. Edwin Mills,<br />\nchairman, claimed that the reason for<br />\nthis is that the Student Council has not<br />\nappointed the two undergraduates that<br />\nare required. However, Chuck Fax, a<br />\nmember of the Student Council, claimed<br />\nthat he is one of the two appointees,both<br />\nof whom were chosen in November. \"I<br />\nwas waiting for Mills to calla meeting,\"<br />\nhe explained.<br />\nDespite his committee's lack of productivity, Mills maintained that \"this<br />\nought to be a Y'dry useful committee-it could be made to be the focus of reform.\" Student Relations was created in<br />\nresponse to the anti-ROTC disturbances<br />\non campus last Spring and focusses,<br />\n<br />\ntheoretically, on academically-oriented<br />\nstudent concerns.<br />\nDean Kimball is chairman of the Library<br />\nCommittee, whose job it is to<br />\nadvice the Librarian on policy with respe 1 to the operation of the facilities.<br />\nKimball refused to comment on the committee's functioning other than, \"In recent years (it) has done a very fine job.\"<br />\nJust A Low B<br />\nOther members of the committee were<br />\nless enthusiastic, declaring it \"hardworking,\" and \"partially effective.\" Dr.<br />\nJames Carpenter, one of the members,<br />\nremarked, \"I'd give it a low B.\" The<br />\ncommittee, however, has stuck to the<br />\ncomparatively<br />\nrigid .schedule of one<br />\nmeeting per month.<br />\nDr. William Bevan, Vice President<br />\nand Provost of the University, is chairman of the interdivisional Long Range<br />\nPlanning Committee, which was set up<br />\non the recommendation of President<br />\nMilton Eisenhower just prior to his retirement. The 21-member committee,<br />\nwhich was active until July, 1969, has not<br />\nmet since, and is in \"a stage of quiessence,\" according to Bevan. Its longawaited report is presently in its seventh<br />\ndraft and is apparently fighting a losing<br />\nbattle with its own obsolescence. The<br />\ncommittee's charge is to look at the University in terms of the future and to make<br />\nspecific recommendations as to plans,<br />\nprograms, faculty,facilities and support.<br />\n<br />\nIn marked contrast to the state of inanition in which many committees find themselves is the extraordinary liveliness of<br />\nthe Student Affairs Committee, chaired<br />\nby Dr. John White. Although frequently<br />\naccused of \"meddling\" and unnecessarily \"playing for power,\" the SAC has<br />\ngained a prestige surpassed only by the<br />\nAcademic Council. The committee, which<br />\ntheoretically advises the Director of Student Affairs, has expanded its field of<br />\nendeavor into such 'fringe' areas as housing, the proposed Student Union,athletics<br />\nand conduct. Although White is quick to<br />\ndefend the SAC's actions as \"relevant to<br />\nstudent affairs,\" observers agree there<br />\nhas traditionally been a power vacuum<br />\nsurrounding the Office of Student Affairs.<br />\nWhite is candid about his approach to<br />\nthe committee. \"I wasn't interested in<br />\nbeing chairman of a committee which sat<br />\non its backside. There are five criteria<br />\nwhich determine the effectiveness of a<br />\ncommittee. First, it must have a clear<br />\nrelationship to the University's structure. Second is the importance of the<br />\narea in which the committee is working.\"<br />\n\"Third,\" he continued, \"its members<br />\nmust work hard to become experts in<br />\ntheir field and must put out good decisions. Power doesn't come overnight-it's a question of being right often.Fourth,<br />\na lot depends on whether the chairman<br />\nfights to make the committee work. And<br />\nfifth,\" he concluded, \"is that the com-<br />\n<br />\nGovernance Committee Makes Plan Public<br />\n(continued from p. 1)<br />\n<br />\nDR. JEROME PERLSTEIN<br />\n<br />\nBefore these are resolved, however,<br />\nthe fundamental question of whether<br />\nHopkins should remain deentralized<br />\nor should be more tightly-controlled,<br />\nmust be determined, he commented.<br />\n\"I would fight as hard as I can against<br />\ncentralization.<br />\nThe greatest advantage of Hopkins is its decentralized<br />\nnature. We take for granted what other<br />\ninstitutions are now striving for.\"-Howard also warned students that<br />\nincreased work and responsibility comes<br />\nwith more governing power.<br />\n\"The<br />\nstudents must decide how much time<br />\nthey will spend. It is one thing to say<br />\nthat they want more power and influence, but will they really put their<br />\nmoney where their mouth is?\"<br />\nMembers of the Governance Committee, which was first approved in<br />\nNovember by the General Assembly,<br />\nwere not selected until January. They<br />\nhave met every week since in the Faculty Club. Bob Cotter and John Guess<br />\nwere asked and have attended some of<br />\nthe meetings. \"We wouldn't trust our<br />\nfindings without bonafide student input,\" said Howard.<br />\n<br />\nDR. JAN MINKOWSK1<br />\n<br />\nDr. George Benton will be replacing Dr. Kimball as Dean of Homewood in July. Described<br />\nas \"hard as nails,\" Benton is determined to<br />\nmake changes in Homewood's system of goernance.<br />\nmittee must follow up on its recommendations. It doesn't do much good to put out<br />\nresolutions and hope that they are eventually enacted upon.\"<br />\n<br />\nInstant Experts<br />\nOne of the most basic conflicts at present is over the concept of ad hoc Corn<br />\nmittees. Kimball and Seanson are in favor<br />\nof maintaining the dual nature of the sYs\"<br />\ntern. \"It would be impossibl to have<br />\nstanding committees for all issues that<br />\nwill arise,\" declared Kimball. Swanson,<br />\nwho estimated that he attends six to eight<br />\ncommittee meetings a week, said, \"I<br />\nthink we could use more one-man committees. There's the problem of a dormant committee losing interest in the question. Then they have to become almost<br />\n'instant experts.' It's better to have a<br />\ncommittee with a'definite charge.\"<br />\nWhite vehemently disagreed. \"Where<br />\nyou have an existing committee structure<br />\nin a field, you should then expand that<br />\ncommittee, but you should work through<br />\nthe structure. It strengthens the system<br />\nand the institution. Those who set up ad<br />\nhoc committees don't trust the standing<br />\ncommittees which already exist.\"<br />\nStrider, less in the limelight of the<br />\ncontroversy, attempted to ananlyse the<br />\nsituation. \"This is the type of thing I<br />\nthink we have get cleared up,\" he<br />\nstated. \"The Academic Council, which is<br />\nfor academic matters, is working well.<br />\nWe need the same thing for non-academic<br />\nmatters.

Benton, will take office on July 1.<br />\nDescribed by White as \"hard as nails,\"<br />\nBenton has recently returned to Hopkins<br />\nafter a three-year stint as Director of<br />\nthe Research Laboratories of the U.S.<br />\nEnvironmental Science Services Administration. He has made it clear that there<br />\nwill be major changes on campus next<br />\nyear.<br />\nBenton is also determined to strengthen<br />\nthe Dean's position. There is no reason,<br />\nhe stated, that the Dean of Homewood<br />\nshould not be as powerful on this campus<br />\nas the Dean of the Medical School is at<br />\nthat institution.<br />\nIn this vein, he sees few choices on<br />\nthe subject of Homewood governance.<br />\nThe faculty, he said, must take a very<br />\nclose, serious look at the question. If<br />\nsomething is not done soon, he stated,<br />\n\"I don't think we should struggle through<br />\nanother year as we have been. Therefore, probably some things will be done<br />\nby administrative fiat. I would try and<br />\nmake some temporary adjustments.\"<br />\n<br />\nHopefully Some Answer<br />\nMost prominent in his plans is the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee. \"There are<br />\ndefinitely communications problems on<br />\ncampus,\" he said. \"I'm all in favor of<br />\nstudents taking a part in running the<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nUniversity, and the SAC has shown itself to be an effective organ of communication.\"<br />\nOne difficulty he finds with the present structure of the committee, however, is that \"it feeds into the wrong<br />\nlevel of the University structure. I feel<br />\nthat it should definitely be responsible to<br />\nthe Dean rather than the Director of<br />\nStudent Affairs.\"<br />\nAlong these lines, he feels that there<br />\nIs the possibility that he might become<br />\nchairman of the committee,on the theory<br />\nthat he could coordinate its actions, much<br />\nlike the President is the chairman of<br />\nthe Academic Council.<br />\nWhite, who accepted his appointment<br />\nfrom Kimbalrfor one year only, does not<br />\nfigure in the decision, and both men were<br />\ncareful to point that that coercion is not<br />\nInvolved in any aspect of Benton's actions.<br />\n\"It's very hard to say if it would be a good<br />\nidea,\" White commented. \"So much of<br />\nwhat goes on here depends upon personalities. It could be a thundering success<br />\nor a total failure.\" Benton has not indicated when he will reach his decision.<br />\nAs White has said about the committee structure, however, \"At the moment<br />\nyou can't call it a system.It's an administrative mess.\" Strider is more optimistic: \"Out of this chaos will evolve<br />\nsomething. Out of this will come some<br />\nanswer.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe first of a series of workshops on<br />\nthe use and abuse of science was held<br />\nWednesday afternoon by the Committee<br />\nfor APL. Few people were in attendance.<br />\nThe ad hoc committee, organized by<br />\nJim Keogh and John Adams, is aimed<br />\nat altering the research priorities at<br />\nHopkins. At the meeting, Keogh called<br />\nfor APL to \"actively seek\" non-military work contracts. He claimed that<br />\npresent studies in such areas as transportation analysis and biomedical research are neither intensive nor extensive enough to meet today's needs.<br />\nAdams directed his attack to the Hopkins' administration. The first step, he<br />\nclaimed, is to make a public policy statement rejecting military contracts in an<br />\nattempt \"to at least get feelers out trying to stimulate new sources of money.\"<br />\nAdams stated that the non-profit<br />\nfoundations are a potential source of<br />\nincome for APL.The present policy of the<br />\nadministration forbids the use of funds<br />\nfrom private corporations. This is<br />\nnecessary, according to Dr. Peter Wagner, a member of the Electrical Engineering<br />\ndepartment and Homewood<br />\nfepresentative on the Advisory Board<br />\nfor the APL, in order \"to avoid any kind<br />\nof conflict of interest charges.\"<br />\nBoth Adams and Keogh are concerned<br />\nabout possible Federal roadblocks to<br />\nchanges in APL priorities. Citing a lack<br />\nof initiative at high levels in govprn-<br />\n<br />\nment, Keogh noted that only continuing<br />\npressure can affect significant change.<br />\n\"So one shouldn't sit back and say \"I<br />\ncan't do anything'. It'll be hard to do but<br />\nthe important thing is not to get side<br />\ntracked.\"<br />\n\"If one is going to offer alternatives<br />\nand wants them to be considered, one<br />\nhas to be pushy,\" said Adams. .<br />\nKeogh was not overly concerned about<br />\nthe poor attendance at the workshop.<br />\n\"People say the reason broad social<br />\nquestions can't attract support is because of the heavy scientific community,\"<br />\nhe Faid. \"I hope that this issue attracts<br />\nthe scientists because this is what they<br />\nshould be concerned with.\"<br />\nThe Committee for APL was formed<br />\nlast week. Organizers Keogh and Adams<br />\nconsider the problem they are dealing<br />\nwith to be of vital and immediate interest,<br />\nand have thus launched the program on<br />\nvery short notice. They feel that the Hopkins laboratory should shift its emphasis away from military research and<br />\nbegin to concern itself with the social<br />\nproblems facing the nation.<br />\nAdams pointed out that presently over<br />\n80% of APL's contracts are military<br />\nin nature. \"The School's basic policy<br />\nshouldn't be to preserve our military<br />\nmight,\" commented Adams. \"Military<br />\nmight for military might is useless.<br />\nThere are bigger problems.\"<br />\n.1=1\u20221\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u202211,<br />\n<br />\n5The National Brewing Co. of Baltimore, Md. at Baltimore, Md.

It is now<br />\nhoped that this evidence of the Committee's good faith will dispel whatever mistrust and hostility is still left among the student body.<br />\nDespite the fact that the Committee did take so long in preparing<br />\nits first major statement, it now appears that the road is open for a rapid<br />\nand effective exploration of the true feelings this campus has toward the<br />\npresent system of governance. This is the only way in which ultimate<br />\ndecisions concerning changes can be made.<br />\nOf the Committee's three-pronged exploration, two parts are immediately, understandable and to be commended. If the issues are ever to be<br />\n1?rought out into the open and analyzed, the only reasonable method is<br />\nthrough an open forum. And, since any forum will only draw a limited<br />\naudience, it is also necessary to conduct a large-scale poll of all sections of<br />\nthe campus. The faculty has made it clear that it will not accept the cries<br />\nof a few as an indication of a mass movement; they, therefore, must be<br />\npresented with the cold facts.<br />\nThe Committee's third approach\u2014the confidential, in-depth sampling<br />\nof selected members of the community\u2014has, however, not been adequately justified. There is no question that in-depth questioning is as important<br />\nas mass-polling, especially as it will require a greater amount of responsible<br />\nreasoning on both sides. Why, though, is it to be kept confidential? What<br />\ndoes either the committee or its witnesses have that must be kept secret<br />\nfrom the rest of the community? The only result of such an action is to<br />\nopen up the committee to charges of bias and weighting of some testimony<br />\nover others.<br />\nWith the exception of this one reservation\u2014and we hope that the<br />\ncommittee will reconsider its decision in the spirit of handling the entire<br />\nmatter openly and candidly\u2014prospects for a rapid and satisfactory conclusion to this first step are looking much better.<br />\nIn the future, working on the premise that \"widespread dissatisfaction\" will be found on the Homewood campus, the Howard Committee<br />\nshould quickly take steps to help formulate a second general committee<br />\non governance. This committee, composed of students and administrators<br />\nas well as faculty, is where the testimony from the Howard Committee<br />\nshould be examined, and the alternatives for Hopkins governance should<br />\nemerge.<br />\nHowever, the future is dependent now on student interest in improving the governing system. This means enough interest to fill out<br />\nquestionnaires, attend meetings and most of all think about the issues.<br />\nThe myriad of questions on governance are not easy. Would the muchadvocated University Senate solve Hopkins' problems or would it degenerate society? Should governance changes be aimed at the Academic<br />\nCouncil or should the department's autonomy be weakened? In what<br />\nproportion should power be delegated to each segment of the University<br />\nand how should the representatives of each be chosen? These plus many<br />\nmore questions must be answered.<br />\nDr. Howard seems willing to push for meaningful changes in the<br />\npresent system, but he believes, and rightly so, that students should express their concern in the matter. In this, only the students can reply,<br />\nmaking the following weeks critical in more ways than preparing for midterms.<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\n<br />\nRichard B.

Either<br />\na society is at war, or it is in a state of<br />\npreparedness forf war, and this has been<br />\ntrue all through recorded history.<br />\nAt any rate, it is a reasonable assumption that a transition to a more or less<br />\npermanent state of peace would have<br />\nsome serious repercussions on the<br />\nworld. And not all of them would necessarily be good. So a good deal of planning<br />\nwould have to be done before any serious<br />\nmoves towards permanent world peace<br />\ncould be made.<br />\nReport from Iron Mountain on the<br />\nPossibility and Desirability of Peace,was<br />\npublished in 1967 by a New York journalist<br />\nnamed Leonard Lewin. According to<br />\nLewin, the Report is the work of a secretly appointed government commission,and<br />\nwas suppressed by the government because of the conclusions it came to. I<br />\nhave also heard that the Report is a hoax,<br />\nand that it was written by Lewin. Either<br />\nway, it doesn't matter: the New York<br />\nTimes called it \"...so elaborate and ingenious and so substantively original,<br />\nacute, interesting and horrifying, that it<br />\nwill receive serious attention regardless<br />\nof its origin.\" And that about sums it up.<br />\nAs the Rand Corporation's answer to<br />\nBrave New World, it is frightening.<br />\n<br />\nWhat Is War?<br />\n\"War\", sayd the Report, \"is not primarily an instrument of policy utilized<br />\nby nations to extend or defend their expressed political values or economic<br />\ninterests<br />\nat the root of all ostensible<br />\ndifferences of national interest lie the<br />\ndynamic requirements of the war system itself for periodic armed conflict.<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nKlopfc<br />\n<br />\nReadiness for war characterizes contemporary social systems more broadly than their economic and politica<br />\nstructures, which it subsumes.<br />\nIn other words, war is the social system. So a planned transition to a peace<br />\nsystem must be based on a detailec<br />\ncomprehension of the functions the wai<br />\nsystem performs for society.<br />\nThe critical, nonmilitary functions of<br />\nwar fall into five main categories. Economically, the \"wasteful\" production of<br />\nweapons provides a critically large segment of the total economy that is subject to completely arbitrary central control, being exercized outside the framework of supply and demand. As such, defense spending serves as a \"balance<br />\nwheel\" with sufficient inertia to stabilize the economy. Defense spending has<br />\nbeen a consistently positive factor in<br />\nraising the GNP. It is not so widely appreciated that the civilian standard of<br />\nliving rose during World War II. War<br />\nthe Report concludes, is \"the essentia<br />\neconomic stabilizer of modern societies.\"<br />\n<br />\nPolitical Functions<br />\nThe political functions are even more<br />\ncritical to social stability. The elimination of war almost necessarily implies<br />\nthe death of the concept of nationhood<br />\nand national sovereignty. You can't have<br />\nmuch of a foreign policy without the<br />\nmeans to enforce it.<br />\nWar is equally indispensable to the<br />\nstable internal political structure of a<br />\nsociety. The threat of war provides the<br />\nsense of external necessity without which<br />\nno modern government has ever stayed<br />\nin power. It enables societies to main.<br />\ntam n necessary class distinctions andthe<br />\nsubordination of the citizen to the state.<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The<br />\nEditors<br />\nWE WON'T GO<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn the month of February local draft<br />\nboards were given permission to induct<br />\nundeferred 19 to 26 year olds who were<br />\nassigned numbers up to sixty in the December 1, 1969 lottery drawing.

Yet must that army<br />\nforce those people it is to serve to support its ventures, no matter how foolish<br />\nthey may seem, by any sort of draft? It<br />\nIs the American tradition that wars<br />\nshould not be fought unless the people<br />\nvolunteer their support of it, and that it<br />\nis declared by their representatives.<br />\nThe Hopkins Vietnam Moratorium<br />\nCommittee recognizes that neither of<br />\nthese imperatives is being constitutionally adhered to. Thus, during the week of<br />\nMarch 16-22 there will be celebrated,<br />\nhere as in the entire nation, an AntiDraft Week. There will be an open meeting to plan action for that week on Monday, March 9. In the period preceding<br />\nMarch 16, there will be circulated a<br />\nstatement declaring that those who sign<br />\nwill refuse induction if drafted, as long<br />\nas the United States continues to wage<br />\nthe unjust war in Vietnam. This statement will be used at the Congressional<br />\nhearings on the draft which will be held<br />\nsoon.<br />\nI.F. Stone's Bi-Weekly recently stated<br />\nthat \"To 'remove American troops from<br />\na combat role\", which is the declared<br />\nintention of the President's Vietnamization program, \"could easily mean a<br />\nminimum of 300,000 troops in South Viet-<br />\n<br />\nnam for a protracted stay.\" A protracted stay would be one which sould \"continue the war until they get what Nixon<br />\nand Thieu consider<br />\na just peace.\"<br />\n(Feb. 9) If there really exists support<br />\nfor President Nixon's Vietnamizatior<br />\nprogram, be demonstrated by the people<br />\ndirectly. If there are enough volunteers<br />\nto continue the conduct of the war, then<br />\nhis support will have been demonstrated. If there are not, then the war ought<br />\nnot be pursued any longer. In any case,<br />\nthere will then have been accomplished<br />\nthe reinstitution of what is constitutionally and morally our right. That is, on the<br />\nbasis of the response, Congress ought<br />\nthen to declare or discontinue the war.<br />\nThe Hopkins Vietnam Moratorium Committee suggests that our response, as<br />\nthose who would have to be recruited for<br />\nvolunteer service, be a unified and definitive WE WON'T GO!<br />\n<br />\nD.

In 1963 there was By the<br />\nNorth Gate, a collection of short stories,<br />\nwhich was followed by another book of<br />\nstories and four novels. A Garden of<br />\nEarthly Delights (1967) was nominated<br />\nfor the National Book Award in fiction<br />\nand her new novel, them, is among the<br />\ntop five being considered this week for<br />\nthe award. She should win it.<br />\n<br />\nSickening World<br />\nthem continues Miss Oates' preference<br />\nfor the family chronicle rooted in social<br />\nobservation. It concerns a \"white trash\"<br />\nfamily residing in Detroit, particularly<br />\nthe mother and two of her four children.<br />\nMiss Oates creates for us a sickening,<br />\nkaleidoscopic world without form or control; tragedy strikes deep and unpredictably and has no consequence. The<br />\nauthor's method is the human nightmare.<br />\n<br />\nLoretta begins the novel as a sixteen<br />\nyear old girl who momentarily finds herself in bed with a young hoodlum(her father, a victim of congenital insanity,<br />\nsleeps in vestibules with a bottle); awakened by a loud noise she finds that<br />\nher brother has blown out the brains of<br />\nthe boy she vaguely remembersfrom the<br />\nnight before. After being sympathetically<br />\nraped by a cop she finds herself pregnant<br />\nand married to him, hopeful for anew life<br />\nwith a baby and house of her own.<br />\n<br />\nSympathetic Rape<br />\nWe soon find that for Loretta and her<br />\nchildren Maureen and Jules there is no<br />\nescape<br />\nfrom wretched poverty. The<br />\nfluidity of the novel is enhanced by the<br />\nintelligence and ambition of Loretta's<br />\nchildren, mixed with that slight touch of<br />\ninsantiy. To them, the future is a place<br />\nwhere people have money and cars and,<br />\nabove all, quiet. Jules learns at an early<br />\nage to get out of the house, where his<br />\nmother lounges in a soiled bathrobe,with<br />\na constantly present can of warm beer.<br />\nIn the world of each of Miss Oates'<br />\ncharacters there is no beginning or end to<br />\nanything, no such thing as cause-and-<br />\n<br />\neffect relationships. Things just happen<br />\nbecause that is the natural way of things;<br />\npeople come and go, entering one's life<br />\nand leaving for no purpose whatever.<br />\nEmotions are superficial at best and when<br />\nexpressed are usually violent, as is constantly demonstrated in Jules' sexual<br />\nrelationships.<br />\n<br />\nCome And Go<br />\nMaureen is very much different than<br />\nher brother, a fact not unusual in view<br />\nof the fact that her father and Jules'was<br />\nnot the same man.She reads a lot; whereas Jules hangs precariously on the edge<br />\nof a criminal existence, Maureen hangs<br />\nprecariously to sanity by submerging<br />\nherself in novels.<br />\nMaureen realizes, like Jules, that<br />\nhappiness is a place and that it can only<br />\nbe had with money. Waking one morning<br />\nto a pretty face in the morror, Maureen<br />\ndecides how she will climb out--by means<br />\nof a little part-time prostitution.<br />\nThe most anguished part of this novel<br />\nis the long description of Maureen losing<br />\nher mind.Men enter her body and leave<br />\nit and then her. They tell her that she is<br />\nloved. What is slowly described for us is<br />\n<br />\nReport from Iron Mountain<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\nSocially, war and conscription serve<br />\nprovide \"disintegrative, unstable<br />\nsocial elements loosely described as<br />\n'fascist\" with an acceptable social role.<br />\nThe military provides a haven for the<br />\n\"unemployable,\" especially in times of<br />\nhigh unemployment. In general,war provides the basic incentive for primary<br />\nsocial organization. Allegiance requires<br />\na cause; a cause requires an enemy. In<br />\naddition, war has an ecological function<br />\nin controlling gross levels of human<br />\nPopulation, as well as important cultural<br />\nand scientific functions.<br />\nAll of these basic functions of war<br />\nmust be replaced with substitute institutions to fill these functions in a<br />\npeace system. Economically, the expediture of resources for \"wasteful,\"<br />\nnonproductive purposes must continue at<br />\na level on a par with previous military<br />\nSpending, and it must be subject to arbitrary control. Various \"social-welfare\"<br />\nprograms have been proposed to this end,<br />\nbut once their capital-investment stage<br />\nis completed, they will lose their utility.<br />\nThe only likely substitute for this function would be a giant, open-ended space<br />\nexploration program.<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nProvide Motivation<br />\nNew social institutions must be developed that will not only control dangerous social dissidence but also provide<br />\na motivation for social organization and<br />\nensure adherence to societal values to<br />\nthe extent that they are understood to<br />\ntranscend the value of individual human<br />\nlife.

It is remarkable<br />\nthat the author does not have to rely very<br />\noften on prosaic escalation and contrived<br />\ninventions of style.<br />\nThere are two moments,however,when<br />\nthe story loses its pace. One is the insertion of two letters written by Maureen<br />\nto Miss Oates (who, she tells us in the<br />\nbeginning, was once in a writing class she<br />\ntaught) which serve no useful purpose<br />\nand are somewhat distracting interludes.<br />\nThe other is a situation whereby Jules<br />\nfinds himself, a week before the riot, in<br />\nthe company of New Left fanatics from a<br />\nlocal college. Miss Oates' attempt to<br />\nsatirize the situation is well intended<br />\nthough not successful.

It's a credit to them that we<br />\nreached these goals and made our season a success.\"<br />\nValvano's charges got off to a quick<br />\nstart, winning five of their first six<br />\ngames.

They also said that the Atomic<br />\nEnergy Commission(AEC)standards for<br />\nradioactive waste material and the Maryland Department of Water Resources<br />\nstandards for thermal pollution are far<br />\ntoo lax.<br />\nThe Report of the Governor's Task<br />\nForce on Nuclear Power Plants said<br />\nthat the Calvert Cliffs plant will not constitute a significant threat. Opponents<br />\nsay, however, that the Task Force was,<br />\nin effect, rigged, because no onewho had<br />\nSpoken out against the plant was appoint-<br />\n<br />\n'Irrelevant?<br />\n<br />\nExperts Split<br />\nThe scientists not hired by the utility<br />\ncompany as consultants have generally<br />\nsplit along discipline lines; ecologists<br />\nand biologists have tended to oppose construction of the plant, while engineers<br />\nand physical scientists feel that it will<br />\nnot cause measurable harm.<br />\nLawyers representing environmental<br />\nand conservation groups cross-examined the power company's consultants and<br />\nits most prestigous independent witness,<br />\nDr. D. W. Pritchard, a prominent oceanographer, and Director of the Chesapeake<br />\nBay Institute of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe attorney for the Baltimore Gas and<br />\nElectric quizzed the critics, including Dr.<br />\nJess Malcolm, Executive Director of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay Foundation, Dr. L. Eugene Cronin, Director of the Chesapeake<br />\nBiological Lab at the University of Maryland and Dr. Edward Radford,Professor<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\ndoms and values of all people. When one<br />\nIs personally threatened by this totalitarian system, it is only natural that he<br />\nreact in self-interest to protect himself.<br />\nOn the other hand, in ethical terms,<br />\nwhat can be said in defense of the perSon who is interested solely in saving<br />\nhis own skin? Should not one confrontation<br />\nwith this oppressive draft make him<br />\nacutely aware of its harmful, brutal effect on the lives of others who are less<br />\nfortunate? Can he live at ease with himself with the knowledge that the ability<br />\nto cough up hundreds of dollars to a skilled lawyer, or some other such \"out,\"<br />\nhas saved him from a fate that now awaits<br />\nso a poorer person?<br />\nIt is a sad fact that after thirty years<br />\nof conscription in this country, the draft<br />\nhas become as American as apple pie.<br />\nPeople blindly accept the process of registration, classification and induction as<br />\n<br />\nof Environmental Medicine at the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth.<br />\n<br />\nif there were no other alternative. As a<br />\nresult, the draft continues to extend the<br />\ncontrol of the state over the lives of its<br />\ncitizens. Through channeling (an infamous \"Hersheyism\"), it usurps the<br />\nindividual's opportunity to choose his<br />\nown future and assigns that right to government officials, who define for all what<br />\nis in the \"national interest.\" Military<br />\nconscription is a form of involuntary<br />\nservitude that subverts the finer impulses of men --duty, loyalty, and responsibility\u2014to the pursuit of the everincreasing ruthlessness and horror of<br />\nmodern war.<br />\nWhat can be done? The draft continues<br />\nto register and classify millions of<br />\nAmericans. It continues to operate only<br />\nthrough the tacit consent of all males<br />\nover 18 years old. It is high time that<br />\nthe draft as a public issue be confronted<br />\nby all of us.<br />\n<br />\nSteve Dinerstein,'70<br />\n<br />\nProbably the tensest moments in the<br />\nhearings came when the company's lawyer objected to both testimony about Federal recommendations on thermal pollution standards and to criticism of the<br />\nAtomic Energy Commission's standards<br />\nfor radioactive wastes. The attorney<br />\ncontended that recommendations that do<br />\nnot have the force of law were irrelevant<br />\nto the hearings.<br />\nWhen the water used to cool the steam<br />\ncondensers of the plant is returned to the<br />\nBaY it will be 10 degrees warmer. The<br />\nMaryland Water Quality Standards permit this 10 degree rise, and a 20 degree<br />\nrise when the normal water temperature<br />\nis below 50 degrees.<br />\nHowever, a committee on water quality standards appointed by the Federal<br />\nWater Pollution Control Agency(FWPCA)<br />\nrecommended that<br />\nthe temperature<br />\nshould not be raised by more than 4 degrees, and by not more than 1.5 degrees<br />\nin summer months. If the water is too<br />\nwarm, spawning and migratory habits<br />\nwill be shifted, some species may be injured and the natural balance of plants<br />\nand animals will be damaged.<br />\nThe<br />\ncommittee recommendations,<br />\nwhich have no legal standing yet, have<br />\nbeen adopted by some other states. The<br />\nDirector of the Department of Water Resources ruled that his decision on granting the permit would not be affected by the<br />\nrecommendations of the committee. The<br />\nDirector has really only to take into account present safety standards which the<br />\nproposed plant does meet.<br />\n<br />\nNot Official<br />\nAny attempt by the critics to enter into<br />\nthe record another quasi-official document was also met by the strenuous objections of the company's counsel. A letter to the director of the AEC from the<br />\ndirector of the FWPCA said that the possible effects of the plant on the ecology<br />\nof the Bay were not adequately known. The<br />\nAEC has issued construction permits to<br />\nthe company after public hearings at<br />\nPrince Frederick, Maryland. The letter<br />\ndoes not have the status of an official<br />\n<br />\nreport, and it was eventually accepted<br />\nin the record by the Director for \"whatever value it has.\"<br />\nThe lawyer for the company also objected to some of Dr. Radford's criticisms of present AEC standards for radioactive waste material. The lawyer said<br />\nthat only the present criteria should be<br />\nconsidered in the granting of the wateruse permit. Dr. Radford noted, for example, that the AEC permits for tritium,<br />\na radioactive isotope of hydrogen, 3000<br />\npicocuries per millileter of water. Dr.<br />\nRadford has concluded that only 10 picocuries/ml. would be safe. The company<br />\nhas unofficially promised to keep the<br />\ndischarge at the 10 picocuries/m1.1evel,<br />\nbut under present regulations, they cannot be prevented from exceeding that<br />\nlevel.<br />\n<br />\nWindow-Dressing<br />\nDr. Radford also charged that the AEC<br />\nhearings at Prince Frederick were \"pure<br />\nwindow-dressing.\" He said that discussion was so severely limited that \"there<br />\nwas no basis for challenging the company's decision to build the plant at that<br />\nlocation.\" Dr. Radford noted the Task<br />\nwhich<br />\nsaid, \"The<br />\nForce Report,<br />\nsequence of approvals and permit issuance for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power<br />\nPlant was felt by a large sector of the<br />\npublic to be improper; this sequence<br />\nshould not be permitted to recur.\"<br />\nSome of the company consultants admitted during cross-examination that<br />\nparts of their data were still incomplete.<br />\nFor example, Dr. Ruth Patrick, director<br />\nof the marine ecology study, said that her<br />\ngroup didn't know yet the temperature<br />\nrequirements for substantial numbers<br />\nof species in Chesapeake Bay. The consultants' studies<br />\nwill be continued<br />\nthrough 1975. Both units of the Calvert<br />\nCliffs plant will be in full operation by<br />\n1974, if the water-use permit is granted.<br />\nDr. Pritchard, the oceanographer,<br />\nstated that there was enough information about the possible effects the plant<br />\nmight have to go ahead with the project.<br />\nHe also felt that the company had taken<br />\nadequate safeguards. Dr. Pritchard,<br />\nthough, has been criticized by some because of his non-biological orientation,<br />\nand his key role in shaping the present<br />\nradioactive standards, which are under<br />\nattack.<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nART GALLERY<br />\n<br />\nCLEANERS.<br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br />\n<br />\nPortraits, Paintings, Franzing<br />\n<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n<br />\nGALLERY G, Ltd.<br />\n<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n467-2123<br />\n<br />\n710 Reisterstown Rd.<br />\n<br />\nPikesville 484-7171<br />\nTailoring, Repairing, Dying<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\n<br />\n)<br />\n<br />\nST.

Hallengren was allegedly<br />\nsympathetic to the demands of the black<br />\nstudents, and a faculty meeting was<br />\ncalled, with Superintendent of Schools<br />\nThomas Sheldon attending. At that meeting, the vice-principal charged that Hallengren displayed Black Panther posters,<br />\nstirred up the students, and lacked dedication to his teaching responsibilities.<br />\nHallengren, a first-year English<br />\nteacher, jumped up and said, \"That's a<br />\ngoddamned lie!\" He was suspended; a<br />\npublic hearing was held at the Department of Education on Thursday.<br />\nAlso at Eastern, girls representing<br />\nthe Black Voice group presented the<br />\nprincipal with four new demands, in-<br />\n<br />\neluding with them criticisms of the present grievance procedure and a demand<br />\nfor a Black Awareness Day, with an<br />\nassembly run by Black Voice.<br />\n<br />\n\"No Prejudice\"<br />\nThe new president of the school board,<br />\nAttorney Robert L. Karwacki, expressed<br />\nhis belief in racial equality andhis sympathy with some student demands during<br />\nan interview conducted by the Baltimore Afro-American. He said that the<br />\nMayor had met with him to determine<br />\nhis attitudes on racial questions, and<br />\nhad been convinced that Karwacki was<br />\nnot prejudiced.<br />\nKarwacki also commented, \"I do think<br />\nthe students have legitimate complaints.\"<br />\nConcerning Dr. Sheldon, he said, \"Dr.<br />\nSheldon I find to be fair, intelligent, and<br />\na well-educated man.There's not a racial<br />\ncell in his body. Racial prejudice is foreign to him.\"<br />\nKarwacki, however, did not request<br />\njudicial amnesty.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nEastern Iligh School has continued to be a hot-bed for student and teacher agitation in<br />\nthe Baltimore School System.<br />\n<br />\nMarch 16-22 Is Flood the Draft Boards Week<br />\nDubbed National End the Draft Week,<br />\nevery individual soon eligable for, in, or<br />\nalready out of the draft, as well as any<br />\nfriends or relatives he may have,is urged to deluge his local board with any information which might in some conceivable way affect or be related to his draft<br />\nstatus. This means according to Mobe<br />\nleaders, mailing newspapers, magazines<br />\nor other bulky documents which have even<br />\nso much as one sentence in them relevant<br />\nto the draft or one's position in it to his<br />\nlocal board.<br />\n<br />\nTake Law Seriously<br />\nThe rationale behind this is that a local<br />\nboard must keep on file anything sent to<br />\nit by aay individual under its jurisdiction. The result being that 4100 draft<br />\nboards will have their files packed with<br />\nall sorts of trivial information and no<br />\ntime to perform their usual activites.<br />\nTrudi Young, a New Mobe spokesman,<br />\nexplained that \"we want everyone to take<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nvits-uccoT\\i\u00b01)1111111NEID<br />\n<br />\nthe Selective Service law so seriously<br />\nthat they inform their local boards of<br />\nevery single change even if they are over<br />\nage or have completed their service.\"<br />\nShe went on to assert that \"the Selective<br />\nService just cannot stand up administratively to absolute obedience to the draft<br />\nlaw.\"<br />\n<br />\nto handle the extra work.<br />\nHowever, her opinion is not held unanimously. Though refusing to comment<br />\ndirectly on what consquences the nationwide flood of trivia would have, one New<br />\nYork Selective Service chief exclaimed<br />\ndispairingly, \"God help us!\".<br />\n<br />\nOther Projects<br />\nSome draft officials deny that any such<br />\nattempt would affect their efficiency in<br />\noperating their board. One of the more<br />\noptimistic, Colonel Kindervatter of the<br />\nSelective<br />\nService Headquarters for<br />\nMaryland State and Chief of the legal<br />\ndivision there, said she couldn't \"see<br />\nwhere they're going to get the people<br />\nand be able to flood boards and cause<br />\nany mass hysteria.\"<br />\n\"If any board gets in such a mass of<br />\nwork and they call for instructions or<br />\nhelp,\" she continued,\" \"we will be glad<br />\nto help them out\" by hiring extra people<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, the new Mobe is sponsoring a nationwide New War Taxes Week<br />\nfrom April 6-15.

This,<br />\nhowever, is far from the case.<br />\nNot only do responsibilities among the various committees overlap (as in the case of the controversy over housing next year's<br />\nundergraduate women), but several committees have been rendered<br />\nineffective from lack of appointments, While others have never<br />\nhad it made clear to whom they<br />\nare to report.<br />\nA case in point is the Homewood Campus Traffic and Parking<br />\nCommittee. The committee, according to its chairman, Dr. Carl<br />\nF. Christ, is theoretically responsible to the President, although<br />\nall of its recommendations are<br />\nactually ,implemented by the Director of Business Services. Its<br />\ncharge states that the committee<br />\nis to \"make recommendations...<br />\nand that these recommendations<br />\nshall be automatically implemented except where they require approval of the President of appro-<br /><br />\npriation of funds.\" The committee<br />\nhas neither a budget nor 'power<br />\nover allocations.<br />\n\"We can make minor recommendations,\" Christ said, \"like rearranging parking spaces or determining the length of time in which<br />\none Can appeal a ticket.\" It has<br />\nno real say any more in the proposed parking garage, which is<br />\nnow tied up in high-level discussions. The committee was involved<br />\nin preliminary planning, but has<br />\ndeferred or been excluded from<br />\nrecent decisions, including whether or not a fee should be charged for on-campus parking.<br />\nThe Bookstore Committee<br />\nhas met only twice this year.<br />\nDean Robert Strider, chairman of<br />\nthe committee, described its purpose as \"looking both ways\"\u2014a<br />\ndiscussion of past finances and of<br />\nfuture plans. \"The Center is currently losing money,\" he said,<br />\n\"although it is presently operating<br />\nmore efficiently than before.\"<br />\nAsked about the possibility<br />\nof a co-op on campus, Strider<br />\nstated that the question had not<br />\n(continued on p. 4)<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nMarch 6, 1970<br /><br />\nBrinkley Says Hopkins Poor Trash Collection<br />\nMust Change Its Image Blamed for Rat Crisis<br />\nDistressed about the homogeneity of<br />\nthe undergraduate student body at Hopkins, William Brinkley, Director of Undergraduate Admissions, said that the<br />\nimage Hopkins portrays must be changed.<br />\n\"We need more variety in our applicants,\" Brinkley noted. \"We get a group<br />\nof applicants that look too darn much<br />\nalike and are to science-oriented.\"<br />\nBrinkley stated that the University<br />\nwas doing what it could to change this<br />\nestablished image.Unfortunately,Brinkley noted that there was little that could<br />\nbe done outside of the various university<br />\npublications which are periodically sent<br />\nto alumni, parents and high schools<br />\naround the country.<br /><br />\nBaltimore's rat problem was the subject of an AWARE meeting last Tuesday<br />\nnight.<br />\nThere are an estimated one million<br />\nrats in Baltimore City, according to<br />\nBlaine Taylor, who spoke at the meeting.<br />\nTaylor is a student at TowsonState College, and a Democratic candidate for the<br />\nState Senate in 1974. The estimated one<br />\nhundred million rats in the United States<br />\ncause approximatly one billion dollars<br />\ndamage yearly, said Taylor.<br />\nTaylor implied that public ignorance<br />\nof the rat problem hampered efforts to<br />\ndeal with it. \"Right now, in the city of<br />\nBaltimore, not far from here, children<br />\ngo to bed at night with rats in their cribs<br />\ninstead of teddy bears,\" observed Taylor.<br /><br />\nLittle Progress<br />\n\"I don't see very much progress,<br />\nespecially when science things attract<br />\nthe news media the way they do today\",<br />\nsaid Brinkley. \"We've been plugging<br />\naway at changing this for three years.\"<br />\nBrinkley said that he would like to see<br />\nmany more humanities-oriented students<br />\napply for admission to Hopkins. He did<br />\nmention that, although he feels there are<br />\nmany good courses in the humanities<br />\noffered to undergraduates, he wuld like<br />\nto see more of them offered to freshmen.<br />\nThis is important asserted Brinkley,<br />\nboth for the freshmen who would benefit<br />\nby such a change and for the University<br />\nas a whole in attracting more candidates with interests outside the sciences.<br />\nSo far, there have been 2431 applications<br />\nsubmitted for next year's freshmen class.<br />\nThis represents a 12% decrease in the<br />\nnumber of applicants from last year.<br />\nThis figure, however, is about the same<br />\nas that for 1968.<br />\nBrinkley noted that many other schools<br />\naround the East have also experienced a<br />\ndecline of about 12% in the number of<br /><br />\nWilliam Brinkley, Director of Admissions:<br />\n\"We need a variety in our applicants.\"<br />\napplications received this year. Brinkley said that his theory and the theory<br />\nof other admissions directors around the<br />\nEast is that this decrease is the result<br />\nof their high tuition costs in a year of<br />\ntight money.<br />\nAs of Tuesday, the admissions office<br />\nhad received applications from 31 women seeking admission into next year's<br />\nfreshmen class. The University also has<br />\nreceived 38 female transfer applications<br />\nof which 23 have been accepted. The<br />\nUniversity had originally planned to accept 50 women transfer students for the<br />\ncoming academic year. Only women who<br />\nare residents of Baltimore and who will<br />\nbe living at home next year will be considered for admission into next year's<br />\nfreshmen class.<br />\n165 black men and 6 black women are<br />\namong the 2431 freshmen applicants. 7<br />\nof the 50 male transfer applicants are<br />\nblack. There are presently 2 black female transfer applicants.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br /><br />\nAside from the economic and psychological damage caused by rats, they are<br />\nalso disease carriers. Among the diseases that are spread by rats are bubonic plague, rabies, jaundice and rickets, Taylor noted.<br /><br />\nBaby's Lips<br />\nTaylor stated that there were over a<br />\nquarter of a million reported rat bites<br />\nin the U.S. in 1967. He emphasized that<br />\nbabies and young children were most<br />\nsusceptible to rat bites. If a baby is left<br />\nin a crib with a bottle, the milk will dry<br />\non his lips, and a rat may smell it.<br />\nThe rat will then climb into the crib and<br />\ngnaw the baby's lips.<br />\nGarbage is the main source of food<br />\nfor rats, said Taylor. \"One of the main<br />\nreasons there are more rats in the ghetto<br />\nthan in any other place is because of poor<br />\ngarbage collection,\" he commented. He<br />\nclaimed that this was due to the absence<br />\nof any registered white voters in the<br />\nghetto area.<br />\nHowever, the rat problem is now<br /><br />\nVisiting Baltimore?

This week is designated as a<br />\ntime of concerted pressure on both local draft boards<br />\nand Internal Revenue centers in the form of demonstrations and civil disobedience.<br />\nLipman's plans for this period depend almost entirely<br />\non the general response to the \"We Won't Go\" petition<br />\nand the activities of End the Draft week. They range<br />\nin scope from a \"march into the center of the city\" to<br />\nrallies on campus.<br /><br />\nBy MIKE MacADAMS<br />\nAccording to ACLU attorney, William Zinman, anyone<br />\nsigning the New Mobilization Committee's \"We Won't<br />\nGo\" petition now being circulated on campus runs the<br />\n\"risk\" of prosecution for conspiracy to violate the draft<br />\nlaws,<br />\nHowever, Mr. Zinman continued, it is \"highly unlikely<br />\nthat anyone would be, though, the Justice Department<br />\ncould take a contrary view.\" In any event, he cautioned,<br />\nthe petition \"scrapes pretty close to the line\" between<br />\ntheoretical and practical illegality.<br />\nPart of the New Mobe's March 16-22 National End<br />\nthe Draft Week, the petition will be distributed on the<br />\nHomewood campus by the Peace Action Committee<br />\n(PAC) of the S.A. Cabinet, beginning Monday, March 9.<br />\n(See Page 12)<br /><br />\nCampus Petition<br />\nAccording to George Lipman, who heads the PAC at<br />\nHopkins, the petition is only one facet of the participation scheduled locally during that week.<br />\nDuring the Draft Week itself, Lipman has arranged<br />\nfor Cao Ngoc Phuong, a former Saigon University professor and leader in several underground Vietnamese<br />\norganizations, to speak at Shriver on March 19, Miss<br />\nCao, Lipman said, is an authority on the American<br />\npolitical and Vietnamization efforts in South Viet Nam.<br />\nIn addition, Lipman stated he hopes to discuss the possibility of rallies, teach-ins and, perhaps civil disobedience activities at Hopkins during an open meeting<br />\nto be held March 9 at Levering.<br />\nThe primary purpose of these endeavors, Lipman<br />\nstated, \"is to get people awake again\" and to help them<br />\n\"get themselves together.\" The petition, itself, Lipman sees as an opportunity to make a meaningful<br />\ncommitment to the peace effort on an individual level.<br />\nIn addition, the Levering-sponsored Draft counselling<br />\nprogram at Morgan State during the next three Saturdays and the programs planned during the next few<br />\nweeks will, Lipman commented, acquaint the student<br /><br />\nGeorge Lipman is head of the campus Peace Action Committee's<br />\nanti-draft petition which may place its signers in violation of the<br />\nlaw.<br />\nwith such developments as the current Laotian involvement and the failure of the Vietnamization Policy.<br />\nSecondly, Lipman noted, the activities of the week will<br />\nserve as a means to \"re-establish the sound community<br />\nties of October\" in order to form a firm organizational<br />\nstructure. This, Lipman stressed, is absolutely essentical to the success of the New Mobe's plans for the<br />\nfollowing months. With good organization, Lipman said,<br /><br />\nIn addition, Lipman asserted that he wants to persuade<br />\nas many students as possible to swamp their draft<br />\nboards with telephone calls and mail concerning any<br />\nsort of trivial information or questions. Individuals<br />\nare also encouraged to visit draft boards personally<br />\nand sustain long conversations or arguments with the<br />\nemployees there.<br />\nIn keeping with the theme of End War Taxes Week,<br />\nLipman plans to send troops of students laden with<br />\npamphlets to all H and R Block and Internal Revenue<br />\nCenters in an all-out propaganda campaign. Though<br />\nthese pamphlets will contain information pointing out<br />\nthe extent to which taxes go to the military rather than<br />\nto poverty or educational programs, their real purpose,<br />\nas in the case of the draft boards, is simply to create<br />\nas much havoc in the organization and execution of duties as is legally possible.<br />\nThe \"We Won't Go\" petitions will be distributed<br />\npersonally to all campus dorm residents. Those participating in the circulation there will be able to explain<br />\nfurther the legal implications involved in signing them.<br />\nTables will also be placed in Levering Dining Room<br />\nduring the afternoon where the petitions will le made<br />\nIndividuals having questions may consult<br />\navailable.<br />\nwith those distributing the petitions thee as well.<br /><br />\nGrad Students Hit Suspension at SAC Meeting<br /><br />\nBob Cotter (left) of the Appeals Board has accused during Wednesday's meeting Dr. John White.<br />\n(right) chairman of the Board, with inproper procedures concerning the suspension of an undergraduate caught stealing books.<br /><br />\nProtests against the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee's suspension of a student for<br />\nstealing books from the bookstore continued at the committee's Wednesday<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nSeveral graduate students attended the<br />\nmeeting in order to express their opposition to the suspension. Bob Cotter,<br />\nPresident of the Graduate Student Organization and a member of the SAC,<br />\na:rtempt to introduce a resolution calling for a retrial of the suspended student.<br />\nThe motion was ruled out of order by<br />\nDr. John White, Chairman of the Committee, because there exists no machinery for such a retrial. Any change in<br />\nthe decision, it was stated would have<br />\nto come from President Gordon. Following the decision last Friday, Cotter<br />\nsent a letter to Gordon asking that he<br />\nreverse the decision.<br />\nDr. Wickwire, who submitted a<br /><br />\nKennedy - King Lectures Postponed<br />\nthat according to Rudoy, \"seemed to<br />\nindicate that he would lecture at Hopkins.\"<br />\nWhen Kennedy declined again last<br />\nmonth, the lecture seemed doomed for<br />\nthe second year. Rudoy, however, noted that he has enlisted the Senator's aid<br />\nin finding a suitable substititute to initiate the lecture series. Possibilities<br />\ninclude Theodore Sorensen, Arthur Schlesinger and Kenneth Galbraith.<br />\nRudoy said a letter is expected within the week from the Senator's office,<br />\nsuggesting possible names and dates.<br />\nWith this information, the Student Council and the International Forum, which<br />\njointly sponsor the lectures, will be<br />\nable to form definite plans.<br /><br />\nThe Student Council's Kennedy and<br />\nMartin Luther King Lecture Series has<br />\nbeen postponed until late spring or next<br />\nfall, due to a series of problems in the<br />\nscheduling of speakers.<br />\nDean Rudoy, chairman of the Kennedy<br />\nLecture Committee, promised that the<br />\nfirst of the speeches will be delivered<br />\nby May. He stated, however, that the<br />\nsecond King series has been postponed<br />\nindefinitely.<br />\nTentative plans for the First Annual<br />\nJohn F. and Robert F. Kennedy Memorial<br />\nLecture on International Affairs were to<br />\nfeature Senator Edward Kennedy.

The Senator at that<br />\ntime said that he wished to devote his<br />\ntime to matters of government and was<br />\nforced to decline the invitation.<br /><br />\nDean Rudoy has tried for two years now in<br />\nvain to persuade Senator Edward Kennedy<br />\nto speak at the Kennedy Lecture series.<br />\nDuring the summer, Kennedy was<br />\nagain contacted by Rudoy, who requested a reconsideration of the refusal. The<br />\nStudent Council received several encouraging letters from the Senator's office<br /><br />\nThe other series, in honor of the late<br />\nMartin Luther King, have been put off<br />\nindefinitely because of the lack of a<br />\nspeaker for the inaugural address. Early<br />\nattempts to attract Mrs. Coretta King<br />\nwere unsuccessful.

It was reported that<br />\nafter the decision was reached, the suspended student agreed that he had had a<br />\nfair trial.<br />\nJohn Ferchak, a graduate student,<br />\nwas present at the committee meeting<br />\nto \"protest the severity of the sentence<br />\nand the manner in which the matter was<br />\nhandled.\" He requested that the Committee publish a majority report clarifying the reasons for its decision. The<br />\ncommittee refused to do so, since the<br />\noriginal meeting had been closed at the<br />\nrequest of the suspended student.<br />\nFerchack pointed out that the Committee had published such a report when,<br />\nlast November, they overturned the suspension of three students involved in the<br />\nOctober Moratorium activities. Since<br />\nthat decision overturned suspensions enacted by the administration, Ferchack<br />\nclaimed that the committee was only interested in explaining decision to the<br />\nadministration, and did not care about<br />\nexplanations to students.<br />\nFer 'hack is a past member of the<br />\nSAC, and was responsible for introducing the original motion on discipline.<br />\nJill Fankhauser, also a graduate student, attended the meeting because she<br />\n\"thought there was an injustice done to<br />\nthe student.\" She went on to say that she<br />\n\"suspected that the committee was rigid,<br />\nand she wanted to argue for reconciliation.\" Her husband David, also at the<br />\nmeeting, stated that the \"Committee is<br />\nso uptight about institutions that they lose<br />\nsight of human values.\" He described<br />\nthe SAC as a \"buffer\" for President<br />\nGordon.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nConfusion Surrounds CommitteeSystem<br />\n(continued from p. 1)<br />\ncome up.<br />\nWilliam Kaiser, a graduate student,is<br />\nalso on the committee,and he claimed that<br />\nhe personally had brought up the co-op<br />\nidea, as well as the possibility of bringing<br />\nin an outside firm to run the Center. He<br />\ncontended that both were voted down<br />\nbecause \"no one knew how they worked.<br />\nThere was also the fear that the Bookstore would lose its 'academic flavor'<br />\nif it were taken over by a profit-conscious enterprise.\"<br />\nThe members stated that they were<br />\nnot sure why the committee met so infrequently, said Kaiser. \"There must be<br />\nsome kind of provision to petition to have<br />\na meeting, but we haven't done it.<br />\nThe ten-month-old Student Relations<br />\nCommittee has not met once during the<br />\n'69-'70 academic year. Dr. Edwin Mills,<br />\nchairman, claimed that the reason for<br />\nthis is that the Student Council has not<br />\nappointed the two undergraduates that<br />\nare required. However, Chuck Fax, a<br />\nmember of the Student Council, claimed<br />\nthat he is one of the two appointees,both<br />\nof whom were chosen in November. \"I<br />\nwas waiting for Mills to calla meeting,\"<br />\nhe explained.<br />\nDespite his committee's lack of productivity, Mills maintained that \"this<br />\nought to be a Y'dry useful committee-it could be made to be the focus of reform.\" Student Relations was created in<br />\nresponse to the anti-ROTC disturbances<br />\non campus last Spring and focusses,<br /><br />\ntheoretically, on academically-oriented<br />\nstudent concerns.<br />\nDean Kimball is chairman of the Library<br />\nCommittee, whose job it is to<br />\nadvice the Librarian on policy with respe 1 to the operation of the facilities.<br />\nKimball refused to comment on the committee's functioning other than, \"In recent years (it) has done a very fine job.\"<br />\nJust A Low B<br />\nOther members of the committee were<br />\nless enthusiastic, declaring it \"hardworking,\" and \"partially effective.\" Dr.<br />\nJames Carpenter, one of the members,<br />\nremarked, \"I'd give it a low B.\" The<br />\ncommittee, however, has stuck to the<br />\ncomparatively<br />\nrigid .schedule of one<br />\nmeeting per month.<br />\nDr. William Bevan, Vice President<br />\nand Provost of the University, is chairman of the interdivisional Long Range<br />\nPlanning Committee, which was set up<br />\non the recommendation of President<br />\nMilton Eisenhower just prior to his retirement. The 21-member committee,<br />\nwhich was active until July, 1969, has not<br />\nmet since, and is in \"a stage of quiessence,\" according to Bevan. Its longawaited report is presently in its seventh<br />\ndraft and is apparently fighting a losing<br />\nbattle with its own obsolescence. The<br />\ncommittee's charge is to look at the University in terms of the future and to make<br />\nspecific recommendations as to plans,<br />\nprograms, faculty,facilities and support.<br /><br />\nIn marked contrast to the state of inanition in which many committees find themselves is the extraordinary liveliness of<br />\nthe Student Affairs Committee, chaired<br />\nby Dr. John White. Although frequently<br />\naccused of \"meddling\" and unnecessarily \"playing for power,\" the SAC has<br />\ngained a prestige surpassed only by the<br />\nAcademic Council. The committee, which<br />\ntheoretically advises the Director of Student Affairs, has expanded its field of<br />\nendeavor into such 'fringe' areas as housing, the proposed Student Union,athletics<br />\nand conduct. Although White is quick to<br />\ndefend the SAC's actions as \"relevant to<br />\nstudent affairs,\" observers agree there<br />\nhas traditionally been a power vacuum<br />\nsurrounding the Office of Student Affairs.<br />\nWhite is candid about his approach to<br />\nthe committee. \"I wasn't interested in<br />\nbeing chairman of a committee which sat<br />\non its backside. There are five criteria<br />\nwhich determine the effectiveness of a<br />\ncommittee. First, it must have a clear<br />\nrelationship to the University's structure. Second is the importance of the<br />\narea in which the committee is working.\"<br />\n\"Third,\" he continued, \"its members<br />\nmust work hard to become experts in<br />\ntheir field and must put out good decisions. Power doesn't come overnight-it's a question of being right often.Fourth,<br />\na lot depends on whether the chairman<br />\nfights to make the committee work. And<br />\nfifth,\" he concluded, \"is that the com-<br /><br />\nGovernance Committee Makes Plan Public<br />\n(continued from p. 1)<br /><br />\nDR.

They<br />\nhave met every week since in the Faculty Club.

It doesn't do much good to put out<br />\nresolutions and hope that they are eventually enacted upon.\"<br /><br />\nInstant Experts<br />\nOne of the most basic conflicts at present is over the concept of ad hoc Corn<br />\nmittees. Kimball and Seanson are in favor<br />\nof maintaining the dual nature of the sYs\"<br />\ntern. \"It would be impossibl to have<br />\nstanding committees for all issues that<br />\nwill arise,\" declared Kimball. Swanson,<br />\nwho estimated that he attends six to eight<br />\ncommittee meetings a week, said, \"I<br />\nthink we could use more one-man committees. There's the problem of a dormant committee losing interest in the question. Then they have to become almost<br />\n'instant experts.' It's better to have a<br />\ncommittee with a'definite charge.\"<br />\nWhite vehemently disagreed. \"Where<br />\nyou have an existing committee structure<br />\nin a field, you should then expand that<br />\ncommittee, but you should work through<br />\nthe structure.

Benton, will take office on July 1.<br />\nDescribed by White as \"hard as nails,\"<br />\nBenton has recently returned to Hopkins<br />\nafter a three-year stint as Director of<br />\nthe Research Laboratories of the U.S.<br />\nEnvironmental Science Services Administration. He has made it clear that there<br />\nwill be major changes on campus next<br />\nyear.<br />\nBenton is also determined to strengthen<br />\nthe Dean's position. There is no reason,<br />\nhe stated, that the Dean of Homewood<br />\nshould not be as powerful on this campus<br />\nas the Dean of the Medical School is at<br />\nthat institution.<br />\nIn this vein, he sees few choices on<br />\nthe subject of Homewood governance.<br />\nThe faculty, he said, must take a very<br />\nclose, serious look at the question. If<br />\nsomething is not done soon, he stated,<br />\n\"I don't think we should struggle through<br />\nanother year as we have been. Therefore, probably some things will be done<br />\nby administrative fiat. I would try and<br />\nmake some temporary adjustments.\"<br /><br />\nHopefully Some Answer<br />\nMost prominent in his plans is the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee. \"There are<br />\ndefinitely communications problems on<br />\ncampus,\" he said. \"I'm all in favor of<br />\nstudents taking a part in running the<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nUniversity, and the SAC has shown itself to be an effective organ of communication.\"<br />\nOne difficulty he finds with the present structure of the committee, however, is that \"it feeds into the wrong<br />\nlevel of the University structure. I feel<br />\nthat it should definitely be responsible to<br />\nthe Dean rather than the Director of<br />\nStudent Affairs.\"<br />\nAlong these lines, he feels that there<br />\nIs the possibility that he might become<br />\nchairman of the committee,on the theory<br />\nthat he could coordinate its actions, much<br />\nlike the President is the chairman of<br />\nthe Academic Council.<br />\nWhite, who accepted his appointment<br />\nfrom Kimbalrfor one year only, does not<br />\nfigure in the decision, and both men were<br />\ncareful to point that that coercion is not<br />\nInvolved in any aspect of Benton's actions.<br />\n\"It's very hard to say if it would be a good<br />\nidea,\" White commented. \"So much of<br />\nwhat goes on here depends upon personalities. It could be a thundering success<br />\nor a total failure.\" Benton has not indicated when he will reach his decision.<br />\nAs White has said about the committee structure, however, \"At the moment<br />\nyou can't call it a system.It's an administrative mess.\" Strider is more optimistic: \"Out of this chaos will evolve<br />\nsomething. Out of this will come some<br />\nanswer.\"<br /><br />\nThe first of a series of workshops on<br />\nthe use and abuse of science was held<br />\nWednesday afternoon by the Committee<br />\nfor APL. Few people were in attendance.<br />\nThe ad hoc committee, organized by<br />\nJim Keogh and John Adams, is aimed<br />\nat altering the research priorities at<br />\nHopkins. At the meeting, Keogh called<br />\nfor APL to \"actively seek\" non-military work contracts. He claimed that<br />\npresent studies in such areas as transportation analysis and biomedical research are neither intensive nor extensive enough to meet today's needs.<br />\nAdams directed his attack to the Hopkins' administration. The first step, he<br />\nclaimed, is to make a public policy statement rejecting military contracts in an<br />\nattempt \"to at least get feelers out trying to stimulate new sources of money.\"<br />\nAdams stated that the non-profit<br />\nfoundations are a potential source of<br />\nincome for APL.The present policy of the<br />\nadministration forbids the use of funds<br />\nfrom private corporations. This is<br />\nnecessary, according to Dr. Peter Wagner, a member of the Electrical Engineering<br />\ndepartment and Homewood<br />\nfepresentative on the Advisory Board<br />\nfor the APL, in order \"to avoid any kind<br />\nof conflict of interest charges.\"<br />\nBoth Adams and Keogh are concerned<br />\nabout possible Federal roadblocks to<br />\nchanges in APL priorities. Citing a lack<br />\nof initiative at high levels in govprn-<br /><br />\nment, Keogh noted that only continuing<br />\npressure can affect significant change.<br />\n\"So one shouldn't sit back and say \"I<br />\ncan't do anything'. It'll be hard to do but<br />\nthe important thing is not to get side<br />\ntracked.\"<br />\n\"If one is going to offer alternatives<br />\nand wants them to be considered, one<br />\nhas to be pushy,\" said Adams. .<br />\nKeogh was not overly concerned about<br />\nthe poor attendance at the workshop.<br />\n\"People say the reason broad social<br />\nquestions can't attract support is because of the heavy scientific community,\"<br />\nhe Faid. \"I hope that this issue attracts<br />\nthe scientists because this is what they<br />\nshould be concerned with.\"<br />\nThe Committee for APL was formed<br />\nlast week. Organizers Keogh and Adams<br />\nconsider the problem they are dealing<br />\nwith to be of vital and immediate interest,<br />\nand have thus launched the program on<br />\nvery short notice. They feel that the Hopkins laboratory should shift its emphasis away from military research and<br />\nbegin to concern itself with the social<br />\nproblems facing the nation.<br />\nAdams pointed out that presently over<br />\n80% of APL's contracts are military<br />\nin nature. \"The School's basic policy<br />\nshouldn't be to preserve our military<br />\nmight,\" commented Adams. \"Military<br />\nmight for military might is useless.<br />\nThere are bigger problems.\"<br />\n.1=1\u20221\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u202211,<br /><br />\n5The National Brewing Co. of Baltimore, Md. at Baltimore, Md.

It is now<br />\nhoped that this evidence of the Committee's good faith will dispel whatever mistrust and hostility is still left among the student body.<br />\nDespite the fact that the Committee did take so long in preparing<br />\nits first major statement, it now appears that the road is open for a rapid<br />\nand effective exploration of the true feelings this campus has toward the<br />\npresent system of governance. This is the only way in which ultimate<br />\ndecisions concerning changes can be made.<br />\nOf the Committee's three-pronged exploration, two parts are immediately, understandable and to be commended. If the issues are ever to be<br />\n1?rought out into the open and analyzed, the only reasonable method is<br />\nthrough an open forum. And, since any forum will only draw a limited<br />\naudience, it is also necessary to conduct a large-scale poll of all sections of<br />\nthe campus. The faculty has made it clear that it will not accept the cries<br />\nof a few as an indication of a mass movement; they, therefore, must be<br />\npresented with the cold facts.<br />\nThe Committee's third approach\u2014the confidential, in-depth sampling<br />\nof selected members of the community\u2014has, however, not been adequately justified. There is no question that in-depth questioning is as important<br />\nas mass-polling, especially as it will require a greater amount of responsible<br />\nreasoning on both sides. Why, though, is it to be kept confidential? What<br />\ndoes either the committee or its witnesses have that must be kept secret<br />\nfrom the rest of the community? The only result of such an action is to<br />\nopen up the committee to charges of bias and weighting of some testimony<br />\nover others.<br />\nWith the exception of this one reservation\u2014and we hope that the<br />\ncommittee will reconsider its decision in the spirit of handling the entire<br />\nmatter openly and candidly\u2014prospects for a rapid and satisfactory conclusion to this first step are looking much better.<br />\nIn the future, working on the premise that \"widespread dissatisfaction\" will be found on the Homewood campus, the Howard Committee<br />\nshould quickly take steps to help formulate a second general committee<br />\non governance. This committee, composed of students and administrators<br />\nas well as faculty, is where the testimony from the Howard Committee<br />\nshould be examined, and the alternatives for Hopkins governance should<br />\nemerge.<br />\nHowever, the future is dependent now on student interest in improving the governing system. This means enough interest to fill out<br />\nquestionnaires, attend meetings and most of all think about the issues.<br />\nThe myriad of questions on governance are not easy. Would the muchadvocated University Senate solve Hopkins' problems or would it degenerate society? Should governance changes be aimed at the Academic<br />\nCouncil or should the department's autonomy be weakened? In what<br />\nproportion should power be delegated to each segment of the University<br />\nand how should the representatives of each be chosen? These plus many<br />\nmore questions must be answered.<br />\nDr. Howard seems willing to push for meaningful changes in the<br />\npresent system, but he believes, and rightly so, that students should express their concern in the matter. In this, only the students can reply,<br />\nmaking the following weeks critical in more ways than preparing for midterms.<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br /><br />\nRichard B.

Either<br />\na society is at war, or it is in a state of<br />\npreparedness forf war, and this has been<br />\ntrue all through recorded history.<br />\nAt any rate, it is a reasonable assumption that a transition to a more or less<br />\npermanent state of peace would have<br />\nsome serious repercussions on the<br />\nworld. And not all of them would necessarily be good. So a good deal of planning<br />\nwould have to be done before any serious<br />\nmoves towards permanent world peace<br />\ncould be made.<br />\nReport from Iron Mountain on the<br />\nPossibility and Desirability of Peace,was<br />\npublished in 1967 by a New York journalist<br />\nnamed Leonard Lewin. According to<br />\nLewin, the Report is the work of a secretly appointed government commission,and<br />\nwas suppressed by the government because of the conclusions it came to. I<br />\nhave also heard that the Report is a hoax,<br />\nand that it was written by Lewin. Either<br />\nway, it doesn't matter: the New York<br />\nTimes called it \"...so elaborate and ingenious and so substantively original,<br />\nacute, interesting and horrifying, that it<br />\nwill receive serious attention regardless<br />\nof its origin.\" And that about sums it up.<br />\nAs the Rand Corporation's answer to<br />\nBrave New World, it is frightening.<br /><br />\nWhat Is War?<br />\n\"War\", sayd the Report, \"is not primarily an instrument of policy utilized<br />\nby nations to extend or defend their expressed political values or economic<br />\ninterests<br />\nat the root of all ostensible<br />\ndifferences of national interest lie the<br />\ndynamic requirements of the war system itself for periodic armed conflict.<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nKlopfc<br /><br />\nReadiness for war characterizes contemporary social systems more broadly than their economic and politica<br />\nstructures, which it subsumes.<br />\nIn other words, war is the social system. So a planned transition to a peace<br />\nsystem must be based on a detailec<br />\ncomprehension of the functions the wai<br />\nsystem performs for society.<br />\nThe critical, nonmilitary functions of<br />\nwar fall into five main categories. Economically, the \"wasteful\" production of<br />\nweapons provides a critically large segment of the total economy that is subject to completely arbitrary central control, being exercized outside the framework of supply and demand. As such, defense spending serves as a \"balance<br />\nwheel\" with sufficient inertia to stabilize the economy. Defense spending has<br />\nbeen a consistently positive factor in<br />\nraising the GNP. It is not so widely appreciated that the civilian standard of<br />\nliving rose during World War II. War<br />\nthe Report concludes, is \"the essentia<br />\neconomic stabilizer of modern societies.\"<br /><br />\nPolitical Functions<br />\nThe political functions are even more<br />\ncritical to social stability. The elimination of war almost necessarily implies<br />\nthe death of the concept of nationhood<br />\nand national sovereignty. You can't have<br />\nmuch of a foreign policy without the<br />\nmeans to enforce it.<br />\nWar is equally indispensable to the<br />\nstable internal political structure of a<br />\nsociety.

It is<br />\nsimple enough to figure that at the present rate, all draft numbers will be<br />\nreached this year, under this new \"more<br />\nequal\" system of selective involuntary<br />\nservice. While we all wish that all armies would be made unnecessary,political<br />\nrealism dictates that an army of some<br />\nsort be maintained. Yet must that army<br />\nforce those people it is to serve to support its ventures, no matter how foolish<br />\nthey may seem, by any sort of draft? It<br />\nIs the American tradition that wars<br />\nshould not be fought unless the people<br />\nvolunteer their support of it, and that it<br />\nis declared by their representatives.<br />\nThe Hopkins Vietnam Moratorium<br />\nCommittee recognizes that neither of<br />\nthese imperatives is being constitutionally adhered to. Thus, during the week of<br />\nMarch 16-22 there will be celebrated,<br />\nhere as in the entire nation, an AntiDraft Week. There will be an open meeting to plan action for that week on Monday, March 9. In the period preceding<br />\nMarch 16, there will be circulated a<br />\nstatement declaring that those who sign<br />\nwill refuse induction if drafted, as long<br />\nas the United States continues to wage<br />\nthe unjust war in Vietnam. This statement will be used at the Congressional<br />\nhearings on the draft which will be held<br />\nsoon.<br />\nI.F.

That is, on the<br />\nbasis of the response, Congress ought<br />\nthen to declare or discontinue the war.<br />\nThe Hopkins Vietnam Moratorium Committee suggests that our response, as<br />\nthose who would have to be recruited for<br />\nvolunteer service, be a unified and definitive WE WON'T GO!<br /><br />\nD.

In 1963 there was By the<br />\nNorth Gate, a collection of short stories,<br />\nwhich was followed by another book of<br />\nstories and four novels. A Garden of<br />\nEarthly Delights (1967) was nominated<br />\nfor the National Book Award in fiction<br />\nand her new novel, them, is among the<br />\ntop five being considered this week for<br />\nthe award. She should win it.<br /><br />\nSickening World<br />\nthem continues Miss Oates' preference<br />\nfor the family chronicle rooted in social<br />\nobservation. It concerns a \"white trash\"<br />\nfamily residing in Detroit, particularly<br />\nthe mother and two of her four children.<br />\nMiss Oates creates for us a sickening,<br />\nkaleidoscopic world without form or control; tragedy strikes deep and unpredictably and has no consequence. The<br />\nauthor's method is the human nightmare.<br /><br />\nLoretta begins the novel as a sixteen<br />\nyear old girl who momentarily finds herself in bed with a young hoodlum(her father, a victim of congenital insanity,<br />\nsleeps in vestibules with a bottle); awakened by a loud noise she finds that<br />\nher brother has blown out the brains of<br />\nthe boy she vaguely remembersfrom the<br />\nnight before. After being sympathetically<br />\nraped by a cop she finds herself pregnant<br />\nand married to him, hopeful for anew life<br />\nwith a baby and house of her own.<br /><br />\nSympathetic Rape<br />\nWe soon find that for Loretta and her<br />\nchildren Maureen and Jules there is no<br />\nescape<br />\nfrom wretched poverty. The<br />\nfluidity of the novel is enhanced by the<br />\nintelligence and ambition of Loretta's<br />\nchildren, mixed with that slight touch of<br />\ninsantiy. To them, the future is a place<br />\nwhere people have money and cars and,<br />\nabove all, quiet. Jules learns at an early<br />\nage to get out of the house, where his<br />\nmother lounges in a soiled bathrobe,with<br />\na constantly present can of warm beer.<br />\nIn the world of each of Miss Oates'<br />\ncharacters there is no beginning or end to<br />\nanything, no such thing as cause-and-<br /><br />\neffect relationships. Things just happen<br />\nbecause that is the natural way of things;<br />\npeople come and go, entering one's life<br />\nand leaving for no purpose whatever.<br />\nEmotions are superficial at best and when<br />\nexpressed are usually violent, as is constantly demonstrated in Jules' sexual<br />\nrelationships.<br /><br />\nCome And Go<br />\nMaureen is very much different than<br />\nher brother, a fact not unusual in view<br />\nof the fact that her father and Jules'was<br />\nnot the same man.She reads a lot; whereas Jules hangs precariously on the edge<br />\nof a criminal existence, Maureen hangs<br />\nprecariously to sanity by submerging<br />\nherself in novels.<br />\nMaureen realizes, like Jules, that<br />\nhappiness is a place and that it can only<br />\nbe had with money. Waking one morning<br />\nto a pretty face in the morror, Maureen<br />\ndecides how she will climb out--by means<br />\nof a little part-time prostitution.<br />\nThe most anguished part of this novel<br />\nis the long description of Maureen losing<br />\nher mind.Men enter her body and leave<br />\nit and then her. They tell her that she is<br />\nloved. What is slowly described for us is<br /><br />\nReport from Iron Mountain<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\nSocially, war and conscription serve<br />\nprovide \"disintegrative, unstable<br />\nsocial elements loosely described as<br />\n'fascist\" with an acceptable social role.<br />\nThe military provides a haven for the<br />\n\"unemployable,\" especially in times of<br />\nhigh unemployment. In general,war provides the basic incentive for primary<br />\nsocial organization. Allegiance requires<br />\na cause; a cause requires an enemy. In<br />\naddition, war has an ecological function<br />\nin controlling gross levels of human<br />\nPopulation, as well as important cultural<br />\nand scientific functions.<br />\nAll of these basic functions of war<br />\nmust be replaced with substitute institutions to fill these functions in a<br />\npeace system. Economically, the expediture of resources for \"wasteful,\"<br />\nnonproductive purposes must continue at<br />\na level on a par with previous military<br />\nSpending, and it must be subject to arbitrary control. Various \"social-welfare\"<br />\nprograms have been proposed to this end,<br />\nbut once their capital-investment stage<br />\nis completed, they will lose their utility.<br />\nThe only likely substitute for this function would be a giant, open-ended space<br />\nexploration program.<br />\nto<br /><br />\nProvide Motivation<br />\nNew social institutions must be developed that will not only control dangerous social dissidence but also provide<br />\na motivation for social organization and<br />\nensure adherence to societal values to<br />\nthe extent that they are understood to<br />\ntranscend the value of individual human<br />\nlife.

It is remarkable<br />\nthat the author does not have to rely very<br />\noften on prosaic escalation and contrived<br />\ninventions of style.<br />\nThere are two moments,however,when<br />\nthe story loses its pace. One is the insertion of two letters written by Maureen<br />\nto Miss Oates (who, she tells us in the<br />\nbeginning, was once in a writing class she<br />\ntaught) which serve no useful purpose<br />\nand are somewhat distracting interludes.<br />\nThe other is a situation whereby Jules<br />\nfinds himself, a week before the riot, in<br />\nthe company of New Left fanatics from a<br />\nlocal college. Miss Oates' attempt to<br />\nsatirize the situation is well intended<br />\nthough not successful.

They also said that the Atomic<br />\nEnergy Commission(AEC)standards for<br />\nradioactive waste material and the Maryland Department of Water Resources<br />\nstandards for thermal pollution are far<br />\ntoo lax.<br />\nThe Report of the Governor's Task<br />\nForce on Nuclear Power Plants said<br />\nthat the Calvert Cliffs plant will not constitute a significant threat.

W.

Eugene Cronin, Director of the Chesapeake<br />\nBiological Lab at the University of Maryland and Dr. Edward Radford,Professor<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\ndoms and values of all people. When one<br />\nIs personally threatened by this totalitarian system, it is only natural that he<br />\nreact in self-interest to protect himself.<br />\nOn the other hand, in ethical terms,<br />\nwhat can be said in defense of the perSon who is interested solely in saving<br />\nhis own skin? Should not one confrontation<br />\nwith this oppressive draft make him<br />\nacutely aware of its harmful, brutal effect on the lives of others who are less<br />\nfortunate? Can he live at ease with himself with the knowledge that the ability<br />\nto cough up hundreds of dollars to a skilled lawyer, or some other such \"out,\"<br />\nhas saved him from a fate that now awaits<br />\nso a poorer person?<br />\nIt is a sad fact that after thirty years<br />\nof conscription in this country, the draft<br />\nhas become as American as apple pie.<br />\nPeople blindly accept the process of registration, classification and induction as<br /><br />\nof Environmental Medicine at the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth.<br /><br />\nif there were no other alternative. As a<br />\nresult, the draft continues to extend the<br />\ncontrol of the state over the lives of its<br />\ncitizens. Through channeling (an infamous \"Hersheyism\"), it usurps the<br />\nindividual's opportunity to choose his<br />\nown future and assigns that right to government officials, who define for all what<br />\nis in the \"national interest.\" Military<br />\nconscription is a form of involuntary<br />\nservitude that subverts the finer impulses of men --duty, loyalty, and responsibility\u2014to the pursuit of the everincreasing ruthlessness and horror of<br />\nmodern war.<br />\nWhat can be done? The draft continues<br />\nto register and classify millions of<br />\nAmericans. It continues to operate only<br />\nthrough the tacit consent of all males<br />\nover 18 years old. It is high time that<br />\nthe draft as a public issue be confronted<br />\nby all of us.<br /><br />\nSteve Dinerstein,'70<br /><br />\nProbably the tensest moments in the<br />\nhearings came when the company's lawyer objected to both testimony about Federal recommendations on thermal pollution standards and to criticism of the<br />\nAtomic Energy Commission's standards<br />\nfor radioactive wastes. The attorney<br />\ncontended that recommendations that do<br />\nnot have the force of law were irrelevant<br />\nto the hearings.<br />\nWhen the water used to cool the steam<br />\ncondensers of the plant is returned to the<br />\nBaY it will be 10 degrees warmer. The<br />\nMaryland Water Quality Standards permit this 10 degree rise, and a 20 degree<br />\nrise when the normal water temperature<br />\nis below 50 degrees.<br />\nHowever, a committee on water quality standards appointed by the Federal<br />\nWater Pollution Control Agency(FWPCA)<br />\nrecommended that<br />\nthe temperature<br />\nshould not be raised by more than 4 degrees, and by not more than 1.5 degrees<br />\nin summer months. If the water is too<br />\nwarm, spawning and migratory habits<br />\nwill be shifted, some species may be injured and the natural balance of plants<br />\nand animals will be damaged.<br />\nThe<br />\ncommittee recommendations,<br />\nwhich have no legal standing yet, have<br />\nbeen adopted by some other states. The<br />\nDirector of the Department of Water Resources ruled that his decision on granting the permit would not be affected by the<br />\nrecommendations of the committee. The<br />\nDirector has really only to take into account present safety standards which the<br />\nproposed plant does meet.<br /><br />\nNot Official<br />\nAny attempt by the critics to enter into<br />\nthe record another quasi-official document was also met by the strenuous objections of the company's counsel. A letter to the director of the AEC from the<br />\ndirector of the FWPCA said that the possible effects of the plant on the ecology<br />\nof the Bay were not adequately known. The<br />\nAEC has issued construction permits to<br />\nthe company after public hearings at<br />\nPrince Frederick, Maryland. The letter<br />\ndoes not have the status of an official<br /><br />\nreport, and it was eventually accepted<br />\nin the record by the Director for \"whatever value it has.\"<br />\nThe lawyer for the company also objected to some of Dr. Radford's criticisms of present AEC standards for radioactive waste material. The lawyer said<br />\nthat only the present criteria should be<br />\nconsidered in the granting of the wateruse permit. Dr. Radford noted, for example, that the AEC permits for tritium,<br />\na radioactive isotope of hydrogen, 3000<br />\npicocuries per millileter of water. Dr.<br />\nRadford has concluded that only 10 picocuries/ml. would be safe. The company<br />\nhas unofficially promised to keep the<br />\ndischarge at the 10 picocuries/m1.1evel,<br />\nbut under present regulations, they cannot be prevented from exceeding that<br />\nlevel.<br /><br />\nWindow-Dressing<br />\nDr. Radford also charged that the AEC<br />\nhearings at Prince Frederick were \"pure<br />\nwindow-dressing.\" He said that discussion was so severely limited that \"there<br />\nwas no basis for challenging the company's decision to build the plant at that<br />\nlocation.\" Dr. Radford noted the Task<br />\nwhich<br />\nsaid, \"The<br />\nForce Report,<br />\nsequence of approvals and permit issuance for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power<br />\nPlant was felt by a large sector of the<br />\npublic to be improper; this sequence<br />\nshould not be permitted to recur.\"<br />\nSome of the company consultants admitted during cross-examination that<br />\nparts of their data were still incomplete.<br />\nFor example, Dr. Ruth Patrick, director<br />\nof the marine ecology study, said that her<br />\ngroup didn't know yet the temperature<br />\nrequirements for substantial numbers<br />\nof species in Chesapeake Bay. The consultants' studies<br />\nwill be continued<br />\nthrough 1975. Both units of the Calvert<br />\nCliffs plant will be in full operation by<br />\n1974, if the water-use permit is granted.<br />\nDr. Pritchard, the oceanographer,<br />\nstated that there was enough information about the possible effects the plant<br />\nmight have to go ahead with the project.<br />\nHe also felt that the company had taken<br />\nadequate safeguards. Dr. Pritchard,<br />\nthough, has been criticized by some because of his non-biological orientation,<br />\nand his key role in shaping the present<br />\nradioactive standards, which are under<br />\nattack.<br /><br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\n_<br /><br />\nART GALLERY<br /><br />\nCLEANERS.<br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br /><br />\nPortraits, Paintings, Franzing<br /><br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br /><br />\nGALLERY G, Ltd.<br /><br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n467-2123<br /><br />\n710 Reisterstown Rd.<br /><br />\nPikesville 484-7171<br />\nTailoring, Repairing, Dying<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br /><br />\n)<br /><br />\nST.

Hallengren was allegedly<br />\nsympathetic to the demands of the black<br />\nstudents, and a faculty meeting was<br />\ncalled, with Superintendent of Schools<br />\nThomas Sheldon attending. At that meeting, the vice-principal charged that Hallengren displayed Black Panther posters,<br />\nstirred up the students, and lacked dedication to his teaching responsibilities.<br />\nHallengren, a first-year English<br />\nteacher, jumped up and said, \"That's a<br />\ngoddamned lie!\" He was suspended; a<br />\npublic hearing was held at the Department of Education on Thursday.<br />\nAlso at Eastern, girls representing<br />\nthe Black Voice group presented the<br />\nprincipal with four new demands, in-<br /><br />\neluding with them criticisms of the present grievance procedure and a demand<br />\nfor a Black Awareness Day, with an<br />\nassembly run by Black Voice.<br /><br />\n\"No Prejudice\"<br />\nThe new president of the school board,<br />\nAttorney Robert L. Karwacki, expressed<br />\nhis belief in racial equality andhis sympathy with some student demands during<br />\nan interview conducted by the Baltimore Afro-American. He said that the<br />\nMayor had met with him to determine<br />\nhis attitudes on racial questions, and<br />\nhad been convinced that Karwacki was<br />\nnot prejudiced.<br />\nKarwacki also commented, \"I do think<br />\nthe students have legitimate complaints.\"<br />\nConcerning Dr. Sheldon, he said, \"Dr.<br />\nSheldon I find to be fair, intelligent, and<br />\na well-educated man.There's not a racial<br />\ncell in his body. Racial prejudice is foreign to him.\"<br />\nKarwacki, however, did not request<br />\njudicial amnesty.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nEastern Iligh School has continued to be a hot-bed for student and teacher agitation in<br />\nthe Baltimore School System.<br /><br />\nMarch 16-22 Is Flood the Draft Boards Week<br />\nDubbed National End the Draft Week,<br />\nevery individual soon eligable for, in, or<br />\nalready out of the draft, as well as any<br />\nfriends or relatives he may have,is urged to deluge his local board with any information which might in some conceivable way affect or be related to his draft<br />\nstatus. This means according to Mobe<br />\nleaders, mailing newspapers, magazines<br />\nor other bulky documents which have even<br />\nso much as one sentence in them relevant<br />\nto the draft or one's position in it to his<br />\nlocal board.<br /><br />\nTake Law Seriously<br />\nThe rationale behind this is that a local<br />\nboard must keep on file anything sent to<br />\nit by aay individual under its jurisdiction. The result being that 4100 draft<br />\nboards will have their files packed with<br />\nall sorts of trivial information and no<br />\ntime to perform their usual activites.<br />\nTrudi Young, a New Mobe spokesman,<br />\nexplained that \"we want everyone to take<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nvits-uccoT\\i\u00b01)1111111NEID<br /><br />\nthe Selective Service law so seriously<br />\nthat they inform their local boards of<br />\nevery single change even if they are over<br />\nage or have completed their service.\"<br />\nShe went on to assert that \"the Selective<br />\nService just cannot stand up administratively to absolute obedience to the draft<br />\nlaw.\"<br /><br />\nto handle the extra work.<br />\nHowever, her opinion is not held unanimously. Though refusing to comment<br />\ndirectly on what consquences the nationwide flood of trivia would have, one New<br />\nYork Selective Service chief exclaimed<br />\ndispairingly, \"God help us!\".<br /><br />\nOther Projects<br />\nSome draft officials deny that any such<br />\nattempt would affect their efficiency in<br />\noperating their board. One of the more<br />\noptimistic, Colonel Kindervatter of the<br />\nSelective<br />\nService Headquarters for<br />\nMaryland State and Chief of the legal<br />\ndivision there, said she couldn't \"see<br />\nwhere they're going to get the people<br />\nand be able to flood boards and cause<br />\nany mass hysteria.\"<br />\n\"If any board gets in such a mass of<br />\nwork and they call for instructions or<br />\nhelp,\" she continued,\" \"we will be glad<br />\nto help them out\" by hiring extra people<br /><br />\nIn addition, the new Mobe is sponsoring a nationwide New War Taxes Week<br />\nfrom April 6-15. Mobe leaders stated<br />\nthat their object in April is to demonstrate and perform acts of civil<br />\ndisobediance at the local draft boards.<br />\nA petition campaign has also begun.<br />\nEntitled \"We Won't Go,\" it states that<br />\nthe signer will not cooperate with the<br />\nmilitary. Although the Mobe leaders<br />\ncontest to its legality, the ACLU noted<br />\nthat signing the petition could run the<br />\nrisk of being prosecuted for conspiracy<br />\nto violate the draft law.<br /><br />\nMENU<br /><br />\nNOTICE<br /><br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nPIZZA<br />\nHOME MADE<br />\nSPAGHETTI<br />\nFRENCH<br />\nWITH<br />\nCHICKEN<br />\nFRIES AND ENGLISH MUFFIN',<br />\nSUBS<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nFIELD REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE AMERICAN<br />\nRED CROSS OFFICE WILL BE ON CAMPUS<br />\nMONDAY, MARCH 9<br />\n4:00 P.M.<br />\nBARTON HALL<br /><br />\nHe was<br />\nsoon<br />\nto become<br />\nthesecond<br />\nmost powerfid<br />\nman in<br />\nNazi<br />\nGermany<br /><br />\nThe Very Best<br /><br />\nTO DISCUSS OPPORTUNITIES WITH STUDENTS INTERESTED IN BECOMING FIELD DIRECTORS.
