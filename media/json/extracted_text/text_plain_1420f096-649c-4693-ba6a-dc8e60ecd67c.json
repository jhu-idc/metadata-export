Near the mantel is a<br />\nsmall tea table prettily set. A chair and a<br />\nsettle covered with fancy cushions are close<br />\nby. Flowers, plants, bric-a-brac are scattered in artistic confusion throughout the<br />\nroom.<br />\nTime: Five o'clock, winter afternoon.<br />\nMiss Imogen Howard (sitting by tea table<br />\nnervously arranging and re-arranging the<br />\ntea paraphernalia)\u2014I suppose it had to<br />\ncome. It is the way of all flirtations, and<br />\nI have simply been doing the summer girl<br />\nact. The beautiful times are over. No<br />\nmore sitting on the rocks at Bar Harbor; no<br />\nmore luncheons at the Casino at Narragansett; and oh, dear! it meant nothing, absolutely nothing\u2014the lovely moonlight sails<br />\nthat . worried mamma so\u2014I have shocked<br />\nAunt Ann in vain, and endangered my<br />\nChristmas gift in that quarter for shortlived pleasure. And now the end has come,<br />\nand I have to brace up and congratulate<br />\nhim upon his engagement to that hateful,<br />\npainted-up little doll, Nancy King! He will<br />\nbe here soon; it is nearly five. Better read<br />\nhis note again and be prepared for the worst.<br />\n(Takes a note from the table and reads.)<br />\n\"My dear Miss Howard: May I drop in for<br />\nmy long promised cup of tea this afternoon,<br />\nand will you listen to me? I have a secret<br />\nto tell you\u2014perhaps you have guessed it. I<br />\nam in love with the sweetest girl in the<br />\nworld. You know well whom I mean without words, and I hope, I pray before the day<br />\n<br />\nis finished to become engaged to her. If I<br />\ndo not hear to the contrary I will be with<br />\nyou at five, and oh! dear Miss Howard I beg,<br />\nthink mercifully of me. Ever yours devotedly, Conrad Dulaney.\" \"Dear Miss Howard\"<br />\nindeed! Last summer I was the \"Fair Imogen.\" Such is life! But I hear the bell.<br />\nI will face the music. At least, he shall not<br />\nsay that I am wearing the willow, but I<br />\nwonder what he sees in that little, nasty,<br />\nidiot, Nancy King\u2014yet report declares that<br />\nhe is with her constantly. (Stuffs note<br />\nunder the sofa _pillow and assumes a dignified attitude).<br />\n(Portiere swung aside and enter Mr. Conrad Dulaney. He holds out both hands)\u2014<br />\nMy dear Miss Howard\u2014Miss Imogen, this<br />\nis joy.<br />\nMiss Howard takes only one hand and<br />\ncoldly motions him to a seat at the opposite<br />\nside of the table.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (feeling snubbed)\u2014I---you<br />\nsee I am here\u2014you received my note?<br />\nMiss Howard (indifferently)\u2014Your note!<br />\noh yes, asking if I would be at home this<br />\nafternoon; you know I always am, at this<br />\nhour.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (aside)\u2014By Jove! how unconcerned. (Aloud)\u2014But, Miss Imogen, I<br />\nhoped that you would give orders to admit<br />\nme alone.<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014Why, really, Mr. Dulaney,<br />\none cannot very well give out generally that<br />\none is at home at five, and then refuse admittance to anybody; can one?<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Under some circumstances.<br />\nI wanted particularly to see yau this afternoon.<br />\nMiss Howard (demurely)\u2014And so, perhaps, might others.<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Doubtless, but still\u2014Oh!<br />\ndear, Miss Howard, you surely remember<br />\nlast summer. Think of our two heavenly<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nweeks at Bar harbor! and of my following<br />\nyou to Narragansett. Think of\u2014<br />\nMiss Howard (interrupting)\u2014Yes, I cannot soon forget Bar Harbor; it is just the<br />\nplace for a generally all-round good time.<br />\nSo many men! I wonder what becomes of<br />\nthem in the winter?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (sarcastically)\u2014Frozen stiff,<br />\npoor devils, by the summer girls when they<br />\nmeet again!<br />\nMiss Howard (indignantly)\u2014How I hate<br />\nthat term, \"summer girl.\" It only means<br />\nsomeone with whom to flirt.<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014More probably someone who<br />\ndoes the flirting. Does it not?<br />\nMiss Howard (argumentatively) \u2014 Not<br />\nnecessarily; but I despise the expression, it<br />\nis so hackneyed. More monotonous even<br />\nthan \"fin-du-seicle\" or \"up-to-date.\"<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Pardon me for using it then.<br />\nBut, Miss Howard, you give me small encouragement to tell you the secret that is<br />\ntrembling upon my lips.<br />\nMiss Howard (pretending surprise)\u2014The<br />\nsecret? Yes, you mentioned you had one.<br />\nBut I thought that it was man's perogative<br />\nto keep secrets, while only woman loved to<br />\ntell.<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Some secrets are never<br />\npleasant save when enjoyed with another.<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014You limit the enjoyment.<br />\nA secret to be thoroughly appreciated should<br />\nbe told to at least a dozen, always with the<br />\ninjunction \"never breathe it to a soul.\"<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014But at all events some secrets must be shared by two at first, must<br />\nthey not?<br />\nMiss Howard (aside)\u2014It is coming; I<br />\nmust brace up. (Aloud)\u2014I suppose so; but<br />\nwhy tell a third?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (confused)\u2014A third? I<br />\ndon't understand. But, Imogen, you are so<br />\ndifferent\u2014so strange.<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014\"Imogen!\" Pray, Mr. Dulaney, when did I lose my surname?<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Excuse me; surely when we<br />\ntook our moonlight sails you allowed me<br />\nthe privilege of calling you by that dear<br />\nname, \"Imogen.\" And I, too, was only<br />\nConrad,<br />\nMiss Howard (scornfully)\u2014How reminiscent you have become. You remind me<br />\nof Aunt Ann: \"In such and such a year we<br />\ndid thus and so.\"<br />\n<br />\nMr. Dulaney (angrily)\u2014Thanks; knowing<br />\nthe opinion you have of your aunt, I am<br />\nflattered, I am sure.<br />\nMiss Howard (also angrily)\u2014What opinon have I of my aunt? Well, truly, Mr.<br />\nDulaney, is it good taste to abuse my relations or discuss my likes or dislikes?<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Again I ask your pardon.<br />\nIt seems to be the only thing that you allow<br />\nme to ask this afternoon.<br />\nMiss Howard (making a brave struggle<br />\nto be funny)\u2014Oh! ask for a cup of tea. I<br />\nam afraid I have not been very hospitable.<br />\nI should have offered it at once; see the<br />\nwater boils nicely.<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Thanks, very much; I never<br />\ntake tea.<br />\nMiss Howard (forgetting her role)\u2014You<br />\ntold me at Narragansett that you perfectly<br />\nadored tea, and that you would often drop<br />\nin for it this winter on your way up town<br />\nfrom the office.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (much pleased)\u2014You do remember Narragansett, then?<br />\nMiss Howard (recovering herself)\u2014Yes,<br />\nsurely; I met Charlie Kidder there, don't<br />\nyou know? and he was devoted to me.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (losing his self-control fearfully)\u2014Dash Charlie Kidder! Oh I do<br />\nhope that you did not hear me. Pardon<br />\nagain, but I so thoroughly despise that chap,<br />\na regular sissy with his feminine voice and<br />\nhis vivid waistcoats and gorgeous ties!<br />\nMiss Howard (trying to look severe)\u2014I<br />\ndid hear your horrible language, and consider that it is most fortunate that Aunt Ann<br />\nis not about.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (smiling)\u2014There I agree<br />\nwith you; but Miss Imogen, don't be cross<br />\nMiss Howard (staving off the news till she<br />\nhas fortified herself with another cup of tea)<br />\n\u2014Oh! by the way, are you interested in<br />\npolitics, and for whom will you vote?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (amazed at the change of<br />\nsubject)\u2014Surely every man is in these days:<br />\nbut I did not know that you cared. Last<br />\nsummer you used to assure me that a good<br />\nbicycle or a stylish modiste was of far more<br />\nconsequence than a good President.<br />\nMiss Howard (coyly)\u2014That was before I<br />\nmet Mr. Du Pine. You know he is a great<br />\ngun in his party, and he has been coaching<br />\nme.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (jealously)\u2014Du Pine! Does<br />\nthat old fossil visit you? He ought to be<br />\npreparing for another and a better world.<br />\nMiss Howard (pleased to have provoked<br />\nwrath)\u2014Well, really, is visiting me a bar<br />\nto future happiness? So like a man to make<br />\nfun of any one cleverer than himself. Now<br />\nI never get angry when I hear of a woman'<br />\nwho is better looking.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (happily)\u2014You never hear<br />\nof one.<br />\nMiss Howard (much appeased)\u2014Thanks;<br />\nyou shall have three lumps of sugar and<br />\nfive pieces of lemon for your politeness.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (laughing)\u2014Spare me. But,<br />\n11!Iiss Howard, won't you listen to my secret,<br />\nor have you guessed it?<br />\nMiss Howard (with dignity)\u2014It is not<br />\nhard to guess what the whole town is discussing.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (surprised) \u2014 The whole<br />\ntown! Why, Imogen\u2014<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014Again I must remind you<br />\nthat I am only \"Imogen\" to my family and<br />\ndearest friends.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (mortified)\u2014Kidder and Du<br />\nPine, I suppose. I can only beg your forgiveness for my presumption, yet, Miss Howard, you have changed towards me; now<br />\nlast summer\u2014<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014Still harping upon last<br />\nsummer. Is the present nothing, Mr. Dulaney, that you should forever dwell upon<br />\nthe past?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (epigrammatically) \u2014 The<br />\npast often times makes the present.<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014Did you get that out of a<br />\nbook, or make it up? It sounds like Mr.<br />\nDu Pine.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (in a temper)\u2014Unfortunately, I \"made it up,' as you say; but if it suggests that ass Du Pine, I will promise you<br />\nnever to repeat it.<br />\nMiss Howard (meditatively)\u2014If it was<br />\nnot too ridiculous, I should imagine that<br />\nyou were jealous.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (gloomily)\u2014I have no right<br />\nto be jealous, have I?<br />\nMiss Howard (stiffly)\u2014I am sure I do not<br />\nknow what rights you have.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (rising)\u2014Well, it is useless<br />\nto prolong this conversation; I see that you<br />\ndo not wish me to speak.<br />\nMiss Howard (aside)\u2014He must not think<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nthat; I must be brave. (Aloud)\u2014Indeed, you<br />\nare mistaken; I wish very much to hear your<br />\nsecret. You said that you were in love and<br />\nhoped soon to be engaged to the \"sweetest<br />\ngirl in the world.\" Of course, it is easy to<br />\ntell who she is\u2014<br />\nMr. Dulaney (coming nearer)\u2014Of course<br />\nit is; and does she love me, do you think?<br />\nMiss Howard (endeavoring to steady her<br />\nvoice)\u2014I fancy so. They say that she is<br />\nnot hard to please, and that she has been<br />\ntrying to become engaged for an age.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (appalled at her candor)\u2014<br />\nReally! (aside)\u2014Confound it, I don't understand her; is she making fun of me?<br />\nMiss Howard (recovering herself and<br />\nsmiling)\u2014Dear Mr. Dulaney, I must not be<br />\nso unamiable. I know that Nancy King is<br />\nan angel in disguise and deserves your love.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (utterly amazed)\u2014Nancy<br />\nKing! What has she to do with my love,<br />\nand why drag her into this discussion?<br />\nMiss Howard (more utterly amazed)-0h,<br />\nis she not the chief motif of it?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (realizing the truth at last)<br />\n\u2014Why, my darling, my beloved, did you<br />\nthink that I was writing of and talking about<br />\nNancy King when I used the expression the<br />\n\"sweetest girl in the world?\"<br />\nMiss Howard (too realizing the truth at<br />\nlast and blushing)\u2014I\u2014<br />\nMr. Dulaney (coming forward and holding<br />\nout his arms)\u2014Little goose!<br />\nMiss Howard (laughing)\u2014The \"sweetest<br />\ngirl in the world,\" don't you mean?<br />\nCurtain<br />\n<br />\nTWELVE O'CLOCK.<br />\nOf all sad words that Bill composed,<br />\nThe saddest are these:\"The bar is closed.\"<br />\n\u2014Cornell Widow.<br />\n<br />\nI went to a party with Janet,<br />\nAnd met with an awful mishap,<br />\nFor I awkwardly emptied a cupful<br />\nOf chocolate into her lap.<br />\nBut Janet was cool\u2014though it wasn<br />\nBut none is so tactful as she,<br />\nAnd, smiling with perfect composure,<br />\nSaid sweetly,\"The drinks are on me!\"<br />\n\u2014Harvard Lampoon<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE BALTIMORE CONCERT.<br />\nThe date of the Musical Clubs' concert has<br />\nat last been definitely announced, posters are<br />\nout, tickets are on sale, and everyone on the<br />\nclubs is engaged in putting on the extra<br />\nfinishing touches which are necessary for the<br />\nmost important concert of the season. At<br />\nany time of day the passer-by may hear the<br />\nstrains of fair music proceeding from the<br />\nwindows of McCoy or Hopkins Halls, for the<br />\nclubs are practicing almost continuously.<br />\nThe Glee Club is in excellent shape; this<br />\nyear's aggregation numbers some of the best<br />\nvoices that have ever been at Hopkins, and<br />\nthe songs are particularly good. Among<br />\nthem are:\"The University Ode,\" with which<br />\nthe concert will probably open; an old English ballad, entitled \"A Franklynne's Dogge<br />\nJumped Over a Style,\" which possesses much<br />\nattraction; \"Hoo Wah Hoo, or the Tale of<br />\nthe Western Desperado,\" to say the least,<br />\nexciting; \"Jenks' Compound;\" a stein song<br />\nby Mendelssohn, and a number of others. A<br />\nquartette, consisting of Messrs. Adkins,<br />\nHaughton, Holmes, and Ruth will be a feature; and it is said that Mr. Bristol has a<br />\nsurprise in the way of some new song<br />\n\"stunts.\"<br />\nThe Mandolin Club has a repertoire no<br />\nless varied than that of the Glee Club: the<br />\n1905 Medley, which contains a little of everything that has caught the popular ear this<br />\nwinter\u2014 \"Katunka,\" \"Blue Bell,\" \"Uncle<br />\nSammy,\" and many others. In addition to<br />\nthe regular members of the club, Mr. Snowden has consented to drum the drum, Mr.<br />\nRuth will try the triangle and Mr. Whittle<br />\nwill flute the flute and blow the French horn.<br />\nThe resulting orchestral effects should be<br />\nhighly pleasing.<br />\nIt was very unfortunate last year that the<br />\nfire occurred just before the concert; for a<br />\ntime, indeed, things looked as if there would<br />\nbe no concert at all. No such disturbing<br />\ncircumstances have arisen this year, however,<br />\nand there is every reason to believe that the<br />\ncoming event will be a great success.<br />\nAs usual, the support of the alumni as<br />\nwell as of the students is solicited. At the<br />\ntime of the University of Virginia concert<br />\nhere this spring, the active co-operation of<br />\nthe Maryland alumni of that University was<br />\n<br />\nnoteworthy. Hopkins graduates, dwelling<br />\nunder the very shadow of the Alma Mater,<br />\nshould not prove less loyal.<br />\n<br />\nDEBATE WITH BROWN<br />\nThe eyes of the student body are eagerly<br />\nfocused upon the date of April 8, when the<br />\nBlack and Blue standard will be raised<br />\nagainst the forces of two leading universities.<br />\nIn the afternoon our doughty twelve will<br />\nmatch their physical strength against that<br />\nof the University of Pennsylvania lacrosse<br />\nsquad, while in the evening, in McCoy Hall,<br />\nthe Hopkins debaters will meet Brown University upon the rostrum.<br />\nIt will be remembered that we defeated<br />\nBrown last year in debate, but as the latter<br />\nis confident of wresting the laurels from us<br />\nthis year, the coming contest will doubtless<br />\nbe a spirited one. The question to be discussed is the same as that which was argued<br />\nin the inter-class debate, viz.: \"Resolved,<br />\nThat the economic and political interests of<br />\nthe United States demand the permanent retention of the Philippine Islands.\"<br />\nUpon that occasion the audience and<br />\njudges were convinced by the winning<br />\nJuniors that an affirmative view should be<br />\ntaken of this question, and it is \"up to\" our<br />\nteam, in the coming debate, to reverse this<br />\nconviction, since we now have the negative<br />\nside.

H. U.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nIt is to be doubted if many of the persons<br />\nwho have been charmed during the past fortnight by Dr. Woodberry's lectures know<br />\nthat the course which they have been attending is part of one of the world's greatest<br />\nfoundations for lectures on poetry. The<br />\nTurnbull foundation ranks at least second in<br />\nthe English-speaking world\u2014perhaps it<br />\nwould be safe to say the world at large. Only<br />\na similar foundation at Oxford University<br />\ncan claim to be the peer of the Turnbull<br />\nlectureship, and this surpasses it only in<br />\npoint of age. Though the Turnbull foundation is a comparatively recent one, it has already advanced to a commanding position.<br />\nTo be asked to deliver the annual series is an<br />\nhonor which any literateur of the world<br />\nwould count a distinction.<br />\nThe able way in which Mr. Woodberry has<br />\nfilled the position this year is proof of the<br />\nwisdom of the authorities in choosing him.<br />\nDr. Woodberry is himself a poet of no mean<br />\nability, as one of his poems, printed elsewhere in this issue, will prove. With the<br />\nintuition of the poet he combines the clear<br />\ninsight and broad grasp of subject of the<br />\ntrained critic; and his course has proved well<br />\nworthy to take its place among the illustrious<br />\ncourses which have preceded it.<br />\nAlthough the two games which have been<br />\nplayed by the baseball nine have not been<br />\nespecially encouraging yet, on the whole, the<br />\nprospects for a good team seem fairly bright.<br />\n<br />\nThe opening game was hardly a just test,<br />\nfrom the fact that it was the first time that<br />\nthe men had played together out of doors.<br />\nIn spite of this, the nine showed up to good<br />\nadvantage, and won by a comfortable score.<br />\nThe second game was a decided disappointment, for although Hopkins seemed to experience more than her share of bad luck,<br />\nyet the result can not be accounted for in this<br />\nway. Individual play was as much to blame<br />\nas lack of team work, and the men seemed to<br />\nbe \"off their game,\" so to speak. However,<br />\nit is much better for a slump to occur at the<br />\nbeginning of the season, when it can be rectified, than at the end. The material at<br />\nHopkins for a winning nine is for the most<br />\npart good, and a little more outdoor practice<br />\nwill doubtless round out the team into excellent shape. The pitcher's box is a matter which is still giving some worry, so the<br />\noutlook will be much brighter when it is<br />\nsatisfactorily decided. The team has a long<br />\nschedule before it, yet on the whole, it seems<br />\nto be quite probable that it will be a successful one.<br />\nThe prospects for the Musical Clubs next<br />\nyear have not hitherto seemed very bright;<br />\nit was difficult to see how any of the clubs<br />\nwere to be kept up to the present standard,<br />\nand the very existence of the Banjo Club<br />\nseemed to be a matter of doubt. In such<br />\na state of affairs it is with a decided feeling<br />\nof hopefulness that most of the under-graduates will read the letter on the subject in<br />\nthis issue from Manager Pagon, who takes<br />\na more optimistic view of the outlook. By<br />\ncalculating up the players from various<br />\nsources who will compose the Mandolin and<br />\nGlee Clubs next winter, he reaches the conclusion that the Mandolin Club should be<br />\nat least as large as it is this year, and that<br />\nthe prospects for the Glee Club are even<br />\nbetter.<br />\nWith the Banjo Club conditions are not<br />\nso promising, however, and its future seems<br />\nto be in the hands of the Freshmen. Only<br />\none man will be left in the club when the<br />\npractice begins next fall, so that the only<br />\nway that the club can be kept up is by several men taking lessons on the banjeaurine<br />\nduring the summer. \"There are,\" Mr.<br />\nPagon says, \"at least eleven men on the<br />\nother two Clubs who would find it very little<br />\n<br />\n\f7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntrouble to take lessons on the banjeaurine.<br />\nIndeed, they should be made to do so\u2014and<br />\nno undergraduate should be allowed to go<br />\non the trips unless he belongs to at least<br />\ntwo clubs.\"<br />\nThis is an admirable suggestion, and if<br />\nmatters can be so arranged as to make these<br />\nmen learn to play the banjeaurine and also<br />\nto encourage several Freshmen to learn to<br />\nplay the same instrument, the success of the<br />\nnext year's Banjo Club is assured. A slight<br />\ndifficulty is encountered in the fact that if<br />\nthe rule is made that no one shall be taken<br />\non the trips unless he belongs to at least<br />\ntwo clubs, it will tend to discourage any of<br />\nthe present Freshman class who might be<br />\nInclined to take lessons on the banjeaurine<br />\nthis summer from doing so, if they did not<br />\nalready play another instrument. But the<br />\nadvantages from such a rule would probably<br />\noutweigh the disadvantages, and we recommend it for consideration to the powers that<br />\ngovern the output of musical talent at the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nY. M. C. A.<br />\nAt the second biennial conference of the<br />\nAssociations in Maryland, Delaware and the<br />\nDistrict of Columbia, held at Annapolis,<br />\nMarch 24-26, Johns Hopkins was represented<br />\nby eleven delegates. The conference was a<br />\nmost successful one; and each delegate of<br />\nthe total one hundred and fifty could get<br />\nsomething for his own benefit. The delegates<br />\nwere royally entertained in the Annapolis<br />\nhomes, and found this one of the best features of the conference. A special session<br />\nfor college men was held Saturday afternoon.<br />\nOther meetings put the college men in touch<br />\nwith the Association work in other departments. The most notable addresses were<br />\nthose of Governor Warfield and Rev. John<br />\nTimothy Stone. The Hopkins delegates<br />\nwere: Boyer, Bird, Fenby, Gould, Glenn and<br />\nLips, of 1907; Curley, Gressitt and Middleton, of 1906; and Glocker and Addison, of<br />\nthe graduate department. Ask any one of<br />\nthem for impressions of the conference.<br />\nThe committee on the Northfield Student<br />\nConference is now beginning work, with W.<br />\nR. Straughn, '05, as chairman. Northfield,<br />\na quaint New England village, with an edu-<br />\n<br />\ncational institution known throughout our<br />\nland, is situated in the northwestern part of<br />\nMassachusetts, about twenty-four hours' distance from Baltimore. It is an ideal place<br />\nfor conferences, and for many summers past,<br />\nthe great student conference, with delegates<br />\nfrom all the leading institutions of our Eastern States, has been held there. Last year,<br />\nover six hundred were in attendance. The<br />\nopportunities open to one who is a member<br />\nof such a convention, the advantages of association with so many of the leaders in all<br />\nbranches of college activity, the ten days'<br />\nlife in camp, the spiritual and physical recreation afforded\u2014all these things will the<br />\ncommittee set before the student body at an<br />\nearly date.<br />\nThe conference will take place this year<br />\nJune 30 to July 9, inclusive. Every student<br />\nwho believes in religious work should consider Northfield before completing his plans<br />\nfor the coming summer. Yale sends more<br />\nthan a hundred men each year; Harvard<br />\nsends fifty to seventy; Pennsylvania, about<br />\nforty.

MacGuinness, Rock Hill's pitching \"star,\" appeared to have slipped his<br />\norbit at the start, and before he settled down<br />\nHopkins had rolled up eight runs. After<br />\nthat, runs were \"no object,\" and the five<br />\nwhich were afterward added to the University's score were the result of chance rather<br />\nthan of purpose.<br />\nThe chief interest to Hopkins rooters lay<br />\nin the fact that the game furnished an excellent opportunity for judging of the ability<br />\nof the various candidates for the team. The<br />\nfine pitching of Waring and Higgins firnished especial cause for satisfaction. It had<br />\nbeen feared that the nine this year would be<br />\nweak in the box, but the showing of these<br />\ntwo twirlers effectually dispelled this fear.<br />\nWaring pitched the first seven innings and<br />\nallowed but three hits, all of which would<br />\nhave been easy outs on a better diamond.<br />\nHiggins, who was in the box the last two<br />\ninnings, struck out four men in this short<br />\ntime and allowed but one hit, also due to<br />\nthe grounds.<br />\nLyon made a beautiful play in the seventh,<br />\nwith a one-hand catch of a wild throw to<br />\nthird. Brown, at first base, was a tower of<br />\nstrength, accepting thirteen chances without.<br />\n<br />\nan error. Captain McDonnell fully lived up<br />\nto his reputation both in the field and at bat.<br />\nRandall played a strong and heady game behind the plate, while Bowie put up his usual<br />\ngood game at third. Iglehart and Goldman<br />\ndid so well in center and left fields respectively that they were given these positions<br />\npermanently. Preston had no chances in<br />\nright field, but proved somewhat of a disappointment at bat. The batting, indeed of the<br />\nwhole team was below what it should have<br />\nbeen, due in large measure, perhaps, to the<br />\nlack of necessity to make runs.<br />\nThe summary:<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nBrown, lb<br />\nLyon, s s<br />\nMcDonnell, 2b<br />\nGoldman, 1. f<br />\nBowie, 3b<br />\nIglehart, e. f<br />\nPreston, r. f<br />\nRandall, c<br />\nWaring, p<br />\nHiggins, p<br />\nTotals<br />\n<br />\nA.B.

JOHNS, 10; HOPKINS, 7.<br />\nThe Hoodoo which always lurks about the<br />\nathletic field at St. John's College upon the<br />\noccasions of Hopkins visits thither, made its<br />\nusual appearance last Saturday and achieved<br />\nits usual success. Last spring St. John's<br />\nwon out in the ninth inning; last fall its<br />\neleven scored the touchdown which won<br />\nfrom Hopkins in the last thirty seconds of<br />\nplay. This time the eighth inning witnessed<br />\nthe advent of the Hoodoo.<br />\nAt the beginning of this inning the score<br />\nstood 7 to 5 in favor of Hopkins. Waring<br />\nappeared invincible and the game seemed<br />\ncertainly won. Then the Hoodoo took a<br />\n.hand. Four errors followed each other in<br />\ngrim procession; Waring was seized with a<br />\npanic and struck two batters; then St. John's<br />\nawoke to its opportunities and \"added wreck<br />\nto ruin\" by smashing out a single and a<br />\nthree-bagger. Five runs was the net result<br />\nof the stampede. The best Hopkins could<br />\ndo in the sole inning which remained was to<br />\ngo out in one, two, three order. Verily, we<br />\nhad \"met the enemy and we were their'n'<br />\nthe Hoodoo's.<br />\nSonie persons who saw the game were inclined to believe that the real name of the<br />\nHoodoo was Demoralization. It may be so,<br />\nbut the NEws-LETTER's \"correspondent at<br />\nthe front\" does not believe so. There was<br />\na child-like simplicity and lack of purpose<br />\nabout the whole thing which to his mind<br />\nwas inevitably suggestive of the supernatural. Past experience strengthens this view,<br />\nand loyalty applauds it. The NEWS-LETTER<br />\nstill holds the high opinion of the nine to<br />\nwhich the Rock Hill victory gave rise. But<br />\nmind, gentlemen of the diamond, no more<br />\nHoodoos!<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE OUTLOOK.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is on the eve of another<br />\nlacrosse season. Never in the history of our<br />\nconnection with the game has the actual<br />\nstrength of the team been so much a matter<br />\nof speculation as it is this year. Until the<br />\nfirst game has been played even the coaches<br />\nwill have hardly more than an incomplete<br />\nidea upon this head.<br />\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that<br />\nsuch a large proportion of the men will be<br />\nnew. . Out of last year's twelve, only five<br />\nmen\u2014Blanck, Meyer, Dill, Morse and Strob-<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nhar\u2014will again be in the line-up. Of course,<br />\nthe veteran \"Bill\" Schmeisser is by no<br />\nmeans a \"new man,\" but the fact remains<br />\nthat half at least, of the positions will have<br />\nto be filled by men who never played on a<br />\n'Varsity team before. The squad as a whole<br />\nhas showed up well in practice, however, and<br />\nthe large infusion of new blood may not<br />\nprove a permanent weakness.<br />\nThe personnel of the team is also a matter<br />\nof guess-work. The large number of the<br />\ncandidates has made the task of selecting the<br />\nteam a difficult one, and the coaches have<br />\nthought it best to go very slowly in so important a particular. The exact line-up for<br />\nthe opening game will scarcely be known<br />\nuntil the men make their appearance on the<br />\nfield; and this line-up is not expected to remain through the season unaltered.<br />\nOne thing, at least, however, should be<br />\nvery plain to all. That is that every student is expected to attend every game.<br />\nApril 8\u2014Lacrosse: Pennsylvania, in Baltimore.<br />\nBaseball: George Washington<br />\nUniversity, in Washington.<br />\n14\u2014Baseball: Baltimore Eastern<br />\nLeague Club, in Baltimore.<br />\n44<br />\n15\u2014Lacrosse: Harvard, in Baltimore.<br />\nBaseball: Univ. of Virginia, in<br />\nCharlottesville.<br />\n44<br />\n20\u2014Baseball: Princeton, in Baltimore.<br />\nIC<br />\n22\u2014Lacrosse: Stevens Institute, in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nBaseball: Gallaudet, in Washington.<br />\n44<br />\n25\u2014Baseball: Baltimore<br />\nEastern<br />\nLeague Club, in Baltimore.<br />\n44<br />\n29\u2014Lacrosse: Lehigh, in Baltimore.<br />\nBaseball: Delaware College, in<br />\nNewark.<br />\nMay 2\u2014Baseball: Baltimore & Ohio R.

But the scarcity of men<br />\nwill not be so great as has been thought. The<br />\nGlee Club will lose only three men, leaving<br />\ntwenty-two to start the year with. Out of<br />\nthis year's Mandolin Club fifteen men will<br />\nbe back. But the prospects of the Club are<br />\neven better than would seem to be indicated<br />\nby this. In the Junior and Freshman<br />\nclasses are four or five men who for some<br />\nreason or other, have not come out this year,<br />\nbut who play fairly well. In the Medical<br />\nSchool is one man who led the club at Yale,<br />\nand another who led the Bowdoin Club, besides a number who have played at Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, and elsewhere. In addition to<br />\nthese are four or five players at the Latin<br />\nSchool who expect to enter this June. These,<br />\nwith the old men, will make up a club of<br />\ntwenty-five or twenty-six men, which is as<br />\nlarge as the Club this year. There is, evidently, therefore, no need of worrying over<br />\nthe Mandolin and Glee Clubs. With the<br />\nBanjo Club, however, conditions are different, for next year only one man will be left.<br />\nYet this is not an insurmountable difficulty,<br />\nfor two years ago the same conditions existed and were overcome. Only one man<br />\nwas left prom the year before. But during<br />\nthe spring and summer four Juniors took<br />\nlessons on the banjeaurine, and the five, together with one Freshman and one graduate<br />\nof the year before, have made up the Club<br />\nfor two years. There is no reason why this<br />\ncannot be repeated. In the other two Clubs<br />\nare at least eleven men who would find it<br />\nvery little trouble to take lessons on the banjeaurine or the guitar during the summer.<br />\nIndeed, they should be made to do so, and<br />\nno undergraduate should be allowed to go<br />\non any of the different trips unless he belongs to at least two clubs.

(Aloud)\u2014But, Miss Imogen, I<br />\nhoped that you would give orders to admit<br />\nme alone.<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014Why, really, Mr. Dulaney,<br />\none cannot very well give out generally that<br />\none is at home at five, and then refuse admittance to anybody; can one?<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Under some circumstances.<br />\nI wanted particularly to see yau this afternoon.<br />\nMiss Howard (demurely)\u2014And so, perhaps, might others.<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Doubtless, but still\u2014Oh!<br />\ndear, Miss Howard, you surely remember<br />\nlast summer. Think of our two heavenly<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nweeks at Bar harbor! and of my following<br />\nyou to Narragansett. Think of\u2014<br />\nMiss Howard (interrupting)\u2014Yes, I cannot soon forget Bar Harbor; it is just the<br />\nplace for a generally all-round good time.<br />\nSo many men! I wonder what becomes of<br />\nthem in the winter?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (sarcastically)\u2014Frozen stiff,<br />\npoor devils, by the summer girls when they<br />\nmeet again!<br />\nMiss Howard (indignantly)\u2014How I hate<br />\nthat term, \"summer girl.\" It only means<br />\nsomeone with whom to flirt.<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014More probably someone who<br />\ndoes the flirting. Does it not?<br />\nMiss Howard (argumentatively) \u2014 Not<br />\nnecessarily; but I despise the expression, it<br />\nis so hackneyed. More monotonous even<br />\nthan \"fin-du-seicle\" or \"up-to-date.\"<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Pardon me for using it then.<br />\nBut, Miss Howard, you give me small encouragement to tell you the secret that is<br />\ntrembling upon my lips.<br />\nMiss Howard (pretending surprise)\u2014The<br />\nsecret? Yes, you mentioned you had one.<br />\nBut I thought that it was man's perogative<br />\nto keep secrets, while only woman loved to<br />\ntell.<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Some secrets are never<br />\npleasant save when enjoyed with another.<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014You limit the enjoyment.<br />\nA secret to be thoroughly appreciated should<br />\nbe told to at least a dozen, always with the<br />\ninjunction \"never breathe it to a soul.\"<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014But at all events some secrets must be shared by two at first, must<br />\nthey not?<br />\nMiss Howard (aside)\u2014It is coming; I<br />\nmust brace up. (Aloud)\u2014I suppose so; but<br />\nwhy tell a third?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (confused)\u2014A third? I<br />\ndon't understand. But, Imogen, you are so<br />\ndifferent\u2014so strange.<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014\"Imogen!\" Pray, Mr. Dulaney, when did I lose my surname?<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Excuse me; surely when we<br />\ntook our moonlight sails you allowed me<br />\nthe privilege of calling you by that dear<br />\nname, \"Imogen.\" And I, too, was only<br />\nConrad,<br />\nMiss Howard (scornfully)\u2014How reminiscent you have become. You remind me<br />\nof Aunt Ann: \"In such and such a year we<br />\ndid thus and so.\"<br /><br />\nMr. Dulaney (angrily)\u2014Thanks; knowing<br />\nthe opinion you have of your aunt, I am<br />\nflattered, I am sure.<br />\nMiss Howard (also angrily)\u2014What opinon have I of my aunt? Well, truly, Mr.<br />\nDulaney, is it good taste to abuse my relations or discuss my likes or dislikes?<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Again I ask your pardon.<br />\nIt seems to be the only thing that you allow<br />\nme to ask this afternoon.<br />\nMiss Howard (making a brave struggle<br />\nto be funny)\u2014Oh! ask for a cup of tea. I<br />\nam afraid I have not been very hospitable.<br />\nI should have offered it at once; see the<br />\nwater boils nicely.<br />\nMr. Dulaney\u2014Thanks, very much; I never<br />\ntake tea.<br />\nMiss Howard (forgetting her role)\u2014You<br />\ntold me at Narragansett that you perfectly<br />\nadored tea, and that you would often drop<br />\nin for it this winter on your way up town<br />\nfrom the office.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (much pleased)\u2014You do remember Narragansett, then?<br />\nMiss Howard (recovering herself)\u2014Yes,<br />\nsurely; I met Charlie Kidder there, don't<br />\nyou know? and he was devoted to me.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (losing his self-control fearfully)\u2014Dash Charlie Kidder! Oh I do<br />\nhope that you did not hear me. Pardon<br />\nagain, but I so thoroughly despise that chap,<br />\na regular sissy with his feminine voice and<br />\nhis vivid waistcoats and gorgeous ties!<br />\nMiss Howard (trying to look severe)\u2014I<br />\ndid hear your horrible language, and consider that it is most fortunate that Aunt Ann<br />\nis not about.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (smiling)\u2014There I agree<br />\nwith you; but Miss Imogen, don't be cross<br />\nMiss Howard (staving off the news till she<br />\nhas fortified herself with another cup of tea)<br />\n\u2014Oh! by the way, are you interested in<br />\npolitics, and for whom will you vote?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (amazed at the change of<br />\nsubject)\u2014Surely every man is in these days:<br />\nbut I did not know that you cared. Last<br />\nsummer you used to assure me that a good<br />\nbicycle or a stylish modiste was of far more<br />\nconsequence than a good President.<br />\nMiss Howard (coyly)\u2014That was before I<br />\nmet Mr. Du Pine. You know he is a great<br />\ngun in his party, and he has been coaching<br />\nme.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (jealously)\u2014Du Pine! Does<br />\nthat old fossil visit you? He ought to be<br />\npreparing for another and a better world.<br />\nMiss Howard (pleased to have provoked<br />\nwrath)\u2014Well, really, is visiting me a bar<br />\nto future happiness? So like a man to make<br />\nfun of any one cleverer than himself. Now<br />\nI never get angry when I hear of a woman'<br />\nwho is better looking.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (happily)\u2014You never hear<br />\nof one.<br />\nMiss Howard (much appeased)\u2014Thanks;<br />\nyou shall have three lumps of sugar and<br />\nfive pieces of lemon for your politeness.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (laughing)\u2014Spare me. But,<br />\n11!Iiss Howard, won't you listen to my secret,<br />\nor have you guessed it?<br />\nMiss Howard (with dignity)\u2014It is not<br />\nhard to guess what the whole town is discussing.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (surprised) \u2014 The whole<br />\ntown! Why, Imogen\u2014<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014Again I must remind you<br />\nthat I am only \"Imogen\" to my family and<br />\ndearest friends.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (mortified)\u2014Kidder and Du<br />\nPine, I suppose. I can only beg your forgiveness for my presumption, yet, Miss Howard, you have changed towards me; now<br />\nlast summer\u2014<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014Still harping upon last<br />\nsummer. Is the present nothing, Mr. Dulaney, that you should forever dwell upon<br />\nthe past?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (epigrammatically) \u2014 The<br />\npast often times makes the present.<br />\nMiss Howard\u2014Did you get that out of a<br />\nbook, or make it up? It sounds like Mr.<br />\nDu Pine.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (in a temper)\u2014Unfortunately, I \"made it up,' as you say; but if it suggests that ass Du Pine, I will promise you<br />\nnever to repeat it.<br />\nMiss Howard (meditatively)\u2014If it was<br />\nnot too ridiculous, I should imagine that<br />\nyou were jealous.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (gloomily)\u2014I have no right<br />\nto be jealous, have I?<br />\nMiss Howard (stiffly)\u2014I am sure I do not<br />\nknow what rights you have.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (rising)\u2014Well, it is useless<br />\nto prolong this conversation; I see that you<br />\ndo not wish me to speak.<br />\nMiss Howard (aside)\u2014He must not think<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nthat; I must be brave. (Aloud)\u2014Indeed, you<br />\nare mistaken; I wish very much to hear your<br />\nsecret. You said that you were in love and<br />\nhoped soon to be engaged to the \"sweetest<br />\ngirl in the world.\" Of course, it is easy to<br />\ntell who she is\u2014<br />\nMr. Dulaney (coming nearer)\u2014Of course<br />\nit is; and does she love me, do you think?<br />\nMiss Howard (endeavoring to steady her<br />\nvoice)\u2014I fancy so. They say that she is<br />\nnot hard to please, and that she has been<br />\ntrying to become engaged for an age.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (appalled at her candor)\u2014<br />\nReally! (aside)\u2014Confound it, I don't understand her; is she making fun of me?<br />\nMiss Howard (recovering herself and<br />\nsmiling)\u2014Dear Mr. Dulaney, I must not be<br />\nso unamiable. I know that Nancy King is<br />\nan angel in disguise and deserves your love.<br />\nMr. Dulaney (utterly amazed)\u2014Nancy<br />\nKing! What has she to do with my love,<br />\nand why drag her into this discussion?<br />\nMiss Howard (more utterly amazed)-0h,<br />\nis she not the chief motif of it?<br />\nMr. Dulaney (realizing the truth at last)<br />\n\u2014Why, my darling, my beloved, did you<br />\nthink that I was writing of and talking about<br />\nNancy King when I used the expression the<br />\n\"sweetest girl in the world?\"<br />\nMiss Howard (too realizing the truth at<br />\nlast and blushing)\u2014I\u2014<br />\nMr. Dulaney (coming forward and holding<br />\nout his arms)\u2014Little goose!<br />\nMiss Howard (laughing)\u2014The \"sweetest<br />\ngirl in the world,\" don't you mean?<br />\nCurtain<br /><br />\nTWELVE O'CLOCK.<br />\nOf all sad words that Bill composed,<br />\nThe saddest are these:\"The bar is closed.\"<br />\n\u2014Cornell Widow.<br /><br />\nI went to a party with Janet,<br />\nAnd met with an awful mishap,<br />\nFor I awkwardly emptied a cupful<br />\nOf chocolate into her lap.<br />\nBut Janet was cool\u2014though it wasn<br />\nBut none is so tactful as she,<br />\nAnd, smiling with perfect composure,<br />\nSaid sweetly,\"The drinks are on me!\"<br />\n\u2014Harvard Lampoon<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE BALTIMORE CONCERT.<br />\nThe date of the Musical Clubs' concert has<br />\nat last been definitely announced, posters are<br />\nout, tickets are on sale, and everyone on the<br />\nclubs is engaged in putting on the extra<br />\nfinishing touches which are necessary for the<br />\nmost important concert of the season. At<br />\nany time of day the passer-by may hear the<br />\nstrains of fair music proceeding from the<br />\nwindows of McCoy or Hopkins Halls, for the<br />\nclubs are practicing almost continuously.<br />\nThe Glee Club is in excellent shape; this<br />\nyear's aggregation numbers some of the best<br />\nvoices that have ever been at Hopkins, and<br />\nthe songs are particularly good. Among<br />\nthem are:\"The University Ode,\" with which<br />\nthe concert will probably open; an old English ballad, entitled \"A Franklynne's Dogge<br />\nJumped Over a Style,\" which possesses much<br />\nattraction; \"Hoo Wah Hoo, or the Tale of<br />\nthe Western Desperado,\" to say the least,<br />\nexciting; \"Jenks' Compound;\" a stein song<br />\nby Mendelssohn, and a number of others. A<br />\nquartette, consisting of Messrs. Adkins,<br />\nHaughton, Holmes, and Ruth will be a feature; and it is said that Mr. Bristol has a<br />\nsurprise in the way of some new song<br />\n\"stunts.\"<br />\nThe Mandolin Club has a repertoire no<br />\nless varied than that of the Glee Club: the<br />\n1905 Medley, which contains a little of everything that has caught the popular ear this<br />\nwinter\u2014 \"Katunka,\" \"Blue Bell,\" \"Uncle<br />\nSammy,\" and many others. In addition to<br />\nthe regular members of the club, Mr. Snowden has consented to drum the drum, Mr.<br />\nRuth will try the triangle and Mr. Whittle<br />\nwill flute the flute and blow the French horn.<br />\nThe resulting orchestral effects should be<br />\nhighly pleasing.<br />\nIt was very unfortunate last year that the<br />\nfire occurred just before the concert; for a<br />\ntime, indeed, things looked as if there would<br />\nbe no concert at all. No such disturbing<br />\ncircumstances have arisen this year, however,<br />\nand there is every reason to believe that the<br />\ncoming event will be a great success.<br />\nAs usual, the support of the alumni as<br />\nwell as of the students is solicited. At the<br />\ntime of the University of Virginia concert<br />\nhere this spring, the active co-operation of<br />\nthe Maryland alumni of that University was<br /><br />\nnoteworthy. Hopkins graduates, dwelling<br />\nunder the very shadow of the Alma Mater,<br />\nshould not prove less loyal.<br /><br />\nDEBATE WITH BROWN<br />\nThe eyes of the student body are eagerly<br />\nfocused upon the date of April 8, when the<br />\nBlack and Blue standard will be raised<br />\nagainst the forces of two leading universities.<br />\nIn the afternoon our doughty twelve will<br />\nmatch their physical strength against that<br />\nof the University of Pennsylvania lacrosse<br />\nsquad, while in the evening, in McCoy Hall,<br />\nthe Hopkins debaters will meet Brown University upon the rostrum.<br />\nIt will be remembered that we defeated<br />\nBrown last year in debate, but as the latter<br />\nis confident of wresting the laurels from us<br />\nthis year, the coming contest will doubtless<br />\nbe a spirited one. The question to be discussed is the same as that which was argued<br />\nin the inter-class debate, viz.: \"Resolved,<br />\nThat the economic and political interests of<br />\nthe United States demand the permanent retention of the Philippine Islands.\"<br />\nUpon that occasion the audience and<br />\njudges were convinced by the winning<br />\nJuniors that an affirmative view should be<br />\ntaken of this question, and it is \"up to\" our<br />\nteam, in the coming debate, to reverse this<br />\nconviction, since we now have the negative<br />\nside. The men selected to represent Hopkins have already won their spurs. They<br />\nare: Messrs. Thomas De C. Ruth, Joseph T.<br />\nSingewald, L. Edwin Goldman (chairman),<br />\nand Ormond W.Hammond,alternate (sec'y).<br />\nThe Brown team will consist of: Messrs.<br />\nGeorge Hurley, Frederick Eugene Hawkins,<br />\nGeorge Gershon Shor, and Lester Leopold,<br />\nFalk, alternate. The New Englanders will<br />\nreach Baltimore about noon Friday, and will<br />\nleave for home on Sunday.<br />\nEach debater will speak twice, the negative, instead of the affirmative, leading off<br />\nin the second round. Mr. French has been<br />\nworking hard with our men ever since the<br />\ninter-class debate, and he shares the general<br />\nconfidence that the team will put up a good<br />\nfight.<br />\nAn attractive program of catchy selections<br />\nhas been arranged by the Musical Clubs,<br />\nwith which to intersperse the weighty de-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nliberations of the speakers.

H. U.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nIt is to be doubted if many of the persons<br />\nwho have been charmed during the past fortnight by Dr. Woodberry's lectures know<br />\nthat the course which they have been attending is part of one of the world's greatest<br />\nfoundations for lectures on poetry. The<br />\nTurnbull foundation ranks at least second in<br />\nthe English-speaking world\u2014perhaps it<br />\nwould be safe to say the world at large. Only<br />\na similar foundation at Oxford University<br />\ncan claim to be the peer of the Turnbull<br />\nlectureship, and this surpasses it only in<br />\npoint of age. Though the Turnbull foundation is a comparatively recent one, it has already advanced to a commanding position.<br />\nTo be asked to deliver the annual series is an<br />\nhonor which any literateur of the world<br />\nwould count a distinction.<br />\nThe able way in which Mr. Woodberry has<br />\nfilled the position this year is proof of the<br />\nwisdom of the authorities in choosing him.<br />\nDr. Woodberry is himself a poet of no mean<br />\nability, as one of his poems, printed elsewhere in this issue, will prove. With the<br />\nintuition of the poet he combines the clear<br />\ninsight and broad grasp of subject of the<br />\ntrained critic; and his course has proved well<br />\nworthy to take its place among the illustrious<br />\ncourses which have preceded it.<br />\nAlthough the two games which have been<br />\nplayed by the baseball nine have not been<br />\nespecially encouraging yet, on the whole, the<br />\nprospects for a good team seem fairly bright.<br /><br />\nThe opening game was hardly a just test,<br />\nfrom the fact that it was the first time that<br />\nthe men had played together out of doors.<br />\nIn spite of this, the nine showed up to good<br />\nadvantage, and won by a comfortable score.<br />\nThe second game was a decided disappointment, for although Hopkins seemed to experience more than her share of bad luck,<br />\nyet the result can not be accounted for in this<br />\nway. Individual play was as much to blame<br />\nas lack of team work, and the men seemed to<br />\nbe \"off their game,\" so to speak. However,<br />\nit is much better for a slump to occur at the<br />\nbeginning of the season, when it can be rectified, than at the end. The material at<br />\nHopkins for a winning nine is for the most<br />\npart good, and a little more outdoor practice<br />\nwill doubtless round out the team into excellent shape. The pitcher's box is a matter which is still giving some worry, so the<br />\noutlook will be much brighter when it is<br />\nsatisfactorily decided. The team has a long<br />\nschedule before it, yet on the whole, it seems<br />\nto be quite probable that it will be a successful one.<br />\nThe prospects for the Musical Clubs next<br />\nyear have not hitherto seemed very bright;<br />\nit was difficult to see how any of the clubs<br />\nwere to be kept up to the present standard,<br />\nand the very existence of the Banjo Club<br />\nseemed to be a matter of doubt. In such<br />\na state of affairs it is with a decided feeling<br />\nof hopefulness that most of the under-graduates will read the letter on the subject in<br />\nthis issue from Manager Pagon, who takes<br />\na more optimistic view of the outlook. By<br />\ncalculating up the players from various<br />\nsources who will compose the Mandolin and<br />\nGlee Clubs next winter, he reaches the conclusion that the Mandolin Club should be<br />\nat least as large as it is this year, and that<br />\nthe prospects for the Glee Club are even<br />\nbetter.<br />\nWith the Banjo Club conditions are not<br />\nso promising, however, and its future seems<br />\nto be in the hands of the Freshmen. Only<br />\none man will be left in the club when the<br />\npractice begins next fall, so that the only<br />\nway that the club can be kept up is by several men taking lessons on the banjeaurine<br />\nduring the summer. \"There are,\" Mr.<br />\nPagon says, \"at least eleven men on the<br />\nother two Clubs who would find it very little<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntrouble to take lessons on the banjeaurine.<br />\nIndeed, they should be made to do so\u2014and<br />\nno undergraduate should be allowed to go<br />\non the trips unless he belongs to at least<br />\ntwo clubs.\"<br />\nThis is an admirable suggestion, and if<br />\nmatters can be so arranged as to make these<br />\nmen learn to play the banjeaurine and also<br />\nto encourage several Freshmen to learn to<br />\nplay the same instrument, the success of the<br />\nnext year's Banjo Club is assured. A slight<br />\ndifficulty is encountered in the fact that if<br />\nthe rule is made that no one shall be taken<br />\non the trips unless he belongs to at least<br />\ntwo clubs, it will tend to discourage any of<br />\nthe present Freshman class who might be<br />\nInclined to take lessons on the banjeaurine<br />\nthis summer from doing so, if they did not<br />\nalready play another instrument. But the<br />\nadvantages from such a rule would probably<br />\noutweigh the disadvantages, and we recommend it for consideration to the powers that<br />\ngovern the output of musical talent at the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nY. M. C. A.<br />\nAt the second biennial conference of the<br />\nAssociations in Maryland, Delaware and the<br />\nDistrict of Columbia, held at Annapolis,<br />\nMarch 24-26, Johns Hopkins was represented<br />\nby eleven delegates. The conference was a<br />\nmost successful one; and each delegate of<br />\nthe total one hundred and fifty could get<br />\nsomething for his own benefit. The delegates<br />\nwere royally entertained in the Annapolis<br />\nhomes, and found this one of the best features of the conference. A special session<br />\nfor college men was held Saturday afternoon.<br />\nOther meetings put the college men in touch<br />\nwith the Association work in other departments. The most notable addresses were<br />\nthose of Governor Warfield and Rev. John<br />\nTimothy Stone. The Hopkins delegates<br />\nwere: Boyer, Bird, Fenby, Gould, Glenn and<br />\nLips, of 1907; Curley, Gressitt and Middleton, of 1906; and Glocker and Addison, of<br />\nthe graduate department. Ask any one of<br />\nthem for impressions of the conference.<br />\nThe committee on the Northfield Student<br />\nConference is now beginning work, with W.<br />\nR. Straughn, '05, as chairman. Northfield,<br />\na quaint New England village, with an edu-<br /><br />\ncational institution known throughout our<br />\nland, is situated in the northwestern part of<br />\nMassachusetts, about twenty-four hours' distance from Baltimore. It is an ideal place<br />\nfor conferences, and for many summers past,<br />\nthe great student conference, with delegates<br />\nfrom all the leading institutions of our Eastern States, has been held there. Last year,<br />\nover six hundred were in attendance. The<br />\nopportunities open to one who is a member<br />\nof such a convention, the advantages of association with so many of the leaders in all<br />\nbranches of college activity, the ten days'<br />\nlife in camp, the spiritual and physical recreation afforded\u2014all these things will the<br />\ncommittee set before the student body at an<br />\nearly date.<br />\nThe conference will take place this year<br />\nJune 30 to July 9, inclusive.

MacGuinness, Rock Hill's pitching \"star,\" appeared to have slipped his<br />\norbit at the start, and before he settled down<br />\nHopkins had rolled up eight runs. After<br />\nthat, runs were \"no object,\" and the five<br />\nwhich were afterward added to the University's score were the result of chance rather<br />\nthan of purpose.<br />\nThe chief interest to Hopkins rooters lay<br />\nin the fact that the game furnished an excellent opportunity for judging of the ability<br />\nof the various candidates for the team. The<br />\nfine pitching of Waring and Higgins firnished especial cause for satisfaction. It had<br />\nbeen feared that the nine this year would be<br />\nweak in the box, but the showing of these<br />\ntwo twirlers effectually dispelled this fear.<br />\nWaring pitched the first seven innings and<br />\nallowed but three hits, all of which would<br />\nhave been easy outs on a better diamond.<br />\nHiggins, who was in the box the last two<br />\ninnings, struck out four men in this short<br />\ntime and allowed but one hit, also due to<br />\nthe grounds.<br />\nLyon made a beautiful play in the seventh,<br />\nwith a one-hand catch of a wild throw to<br />\nthird. Brown, at first base, was a tower of<br />\nstrength, accepting thirteen chances without.<br /><br />\nan error. Captain McDonnell fully lived up<br />\nto his reputation both in the field and at bat.<br />\nRandall played a strong and heady game behind the plate, while Bowie put up his usual<br />\ngood game at third. Iglehart and Goldman<br />\ndid so well in center and left fields respectively that they were given these positions<br />\npermanently. Preston had no chances in<br />\nright field, but proved somewhat of a disappointment at bat. The batting, indeed of the<br />\nwhole team was below what it should have<br />\nbeen, due in large measure, perhaps, to the<br />\nlack of necessity to make runs.<br />\nThe summary:<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nBrown, lb<br />\nLyon, s s<br />\nMcDonnell, 2b<br />\nGoldman, 1. f<br />\nBowie, 3b<br />\nIglehart, e. f<br />\nPreston, r. f<br />\nRandall, c<br />\nWaring, p<br />\nHiggins, p<br />\nTotals<br /><br />\nA.B.

JOHNS, 10; HOPKINS, 7.<br />\nThe Hoodoo which always lurks about the<br />\nathletic field at St. John's College upon the<br />\noccasions of Hopkins visits thither, made its<br />\nusual appearance last Saturday and achieved<br />\nits usual success. Last spring St. John's<br />\nwon out in the ninth inning; last fall its<br />\neleven scored the touchdown which won<br />\nfrom Hopkins in the last thirty seconds of<br />\nplay. This time the eighth inning witnessed<br />\nthe advent of the Hoodoo.<br />\nAt the beginning of this inning the score<br />\nstood 7 to 5 in favor of Hopkins. Waring<br />\nappeared invincible and the game seemed<br />\ncertainly won. Then the Hoodoo took a<br />\n.hand. Four errors followed each other in<br />\ngrim procession; Waring was seized with a<br />\npanic and struck two batters; then St. John's<br />\nawoke to its opportunities and \"added wreck<br />\nto ruin\" by smashing out a single and a<br />\nthree-bagger. Five runs was the net result<br />\nof the stampede. The best Hopkins could<br />\ndo in the sole inning which remained was to<br />\ngo out in one, two, three order. Verily, we<br />\nhad \"met the enemy and we were their'n'<br />\nthe Hoodoo's.<br />\nSonie persons who saw the game were inclined to believe that the real name of the<br />\nHoodoo was Demoralization. It may be so,<br />\nbut the NEws-LETTER's \"correspondent at<br />\nthe front\" does not believe so. There was<br />\na child-like simplicity and lack of purpose<br />\nabout the whole thing which to his mind<br />\nwas inevitably suggestive of the supernatural. Past experience strengthens this view,<br />\nand loyalty applauds it. The NEWS-LETTER<br />\nstill holds the high opinion of the nine to<br />\nwhich the Rock Hill victory gave rise. But<br />\nmind, gentlemen of the diamond, no more<br />\nHoodoos!<br /><br />\nLACROSSE OUTLOOK.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is on the eve of another<br />\nlacrosse season. Never in the history of our<br />\nconnection with the game has the actual<br />\nstrength of the team been so much a matter<br />\nof speculation as it is this year. Until the<br />\nfirst game has been played even the coaches<br />\nwill have hardly more than an incomplete<br />\nidea upon this head.<br />\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that<br />\nsuch a large proportion of the men will be<br />\nnew. . Out of last year's twelve, only five<br />\nmen\u2014Blanck, Meyer, Dill, Morse and Strob-<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nhar\u2014will again be in the line-up. Of course,<br />\nthe veteran \"Bill\" Schmeisser is by no<br />\nmeans a \"new man,\" but the fact remains<br />\nthat half at least, of the positions will have<br />\nto be filled by men who never played on a<br />\n'Varsity team before. The squad as a whole<br />\nhas showed up well in practice, however, and<br />\nthe large infusion of new blood may not<br />\nprove a permanent weakness.<br />\nThe personnel of the team is also a matter<br />\nof guess-work. The large number of the<br />\ncandidates has made the task of selecting the<br />\nteam a difficult one, and the coaches have<br />\nthought it best to go very slowly in so important a particular. The exact line-up for<br />\nthe opening game will scarcely be known<br />\nuntil the men make their appearance on the<br />\nfield; and this line-up is not expected to remain through the season unaltered.<br />\nOne thing, at least, however, should be<br />\nvery plain to all. That is that every student is expected to attend every game.<br />\nApril 8\u2014Lacrosse: Pennsylvania, in Baltimore.<br />\nBaseball: George Washington<br />\nUniversity, in Washington.<br />\n14\u2014Baseball: Baltimore Eastern<br />\nLeague Club, in Baltimore.<br />\n44<br />\n15\u2014Lacrosse: Harvard, in Baltimore.<br />\nBaseball: Univ. of Virginia, in<br />\nCharlottesville.<br />\n44<br />\n20\u2014Baseball: Princeton, in Baltimore.<br />\nIC<br />\n22\u2014Lacrosse: Stevens Institute, in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nBaseball: Gallaudet, in Washington.<br />\n44<br />\n25\u2014Baseball: Baltimore<br />\nEastern<br />\nLeague Club, in Baltimore.<br />\n44<br />\n29\u2014Lacrosse: Lehigh, in Baltimore.<br />\nBaseball: Delaware College, in<br />\nNewark.<br />\nMay 2\u2014Baseball: Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.

But the scarcity of men<br />\nwill not be so great as has been thought. The<br />\nGlee Club will lose only three men, leaving<br />\ntwenty-two to start the year with. Out of<br />\nthis year's Mandolin Club fifteen men will<br />\nbe back. But the prospects of the Club are<br />\neven better than would seem to be indicated<br />\nby this. In the Junior and Freshman<br />\nclasses are four or five men who for some<br />\nreason or other, have not come out this year,<br />\nbut who play fairly well. In the Medical<br />\nSchool is one man who led the club at Yale,<br />\nand another who led the Bowdoin Club, besides a number who have played at Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, and elsewhere. In addition to<br />\nthese are four or five players at the Latin<br />\nSchool who expect to enter this June. These,<br />\nwith the old men, will make up a club of<br />\ntwenty-five or twenty-six men, which is as<br />\nlarge as the Club this year. There is, evidently, therefore, no need of worrying over<br />\nthe Mandolin and Glee Clubs. With the<br />\nBanjo Club, however, conditions are different, for next year only one man will be left.<br />\nYet this is not an insurmountable difficulty,<br />\nfor two years ago the same conditions existed and were overcome. Only one man<br />\nwas left prom the year before. But during<br />\nthe spring and summer four Juniors took<br />\nlessons on the banjeaurine, and the five, together with one Freshman and one graduate<br />\nof the year before, have made up the Club<br />\nfor two years. There is no reason why this<br />\ncannot be repeated. In the other two Clubs<br />\nare at least eleven men who would find it<br />\nvery little trouble to take lessons on the banjeaurine or the guitar during the summer.<br />\nIndeed, they should be made to do so, and<br />\nno undergraduate should be allowed to go<br />\non any of the different trips unless he belongs to at least two clubs. These eleven<br />\nmen could make a club every bit as good<br />\nas the one this year if they would only work.<br />\nIf need be the trustees of the University<br />\nmight be asked for fifty or seventy-five, dollars with which to pay a teacher.<br /><br />\nBut whatever is done, have a Banjo Club,<br />\neven though it consists of only five or six<br />\nmen. A small club that plays well is every<br />\nbit as good as a large one that plays poorly.<br />\nIn the year 1892 the Mandolin Club consisted of .only four men: two mandolins, one<br />\nbanjo and one guitar. But there is no need<br />\nof having a small club, for if every one will<br />\nwork, a club of fifteen or sixteen can be<br />\ngotten together which will be all the better<br />\nfor the work having been expended in building it up.<br />\nSincerely Yours,<br />\nW.
