Garvin Chair of Chemical<br />\nthe selection and education of chemi-<br />\n<br />\ninauguration of the new plan for<br />\ncal students. In continuance of its past record of high achievement,<br />\nthe Chemistry Department takes another step forward. Congratulations<br />\nare in order.<br />\nIn this present age of high pressure methods the field of science<br />\nrequires men whose training is more than superficial. The new scheme<br />\nplanned by Dr. Neil E. Gordon and made possible by the generosity<br />\nof Francis P. Garvin, the most prominent lay chemist of today, will go<br />\nfar toward turning out men qualified to meet the increasingly complex<br />\nproblems confronting chemistry. The men selected to pursue their<br />\ntraining here at Hopkins are supposedly of unusual ability and are to<br />\nbe trained to take places in educating the chemists of tomorrow.<br />\nThough we shall probably not find any genius such as pseudo-scientist<br />\nEdison recently attempted to discover, it is, nevertheless, within the<br />\nmeans of this plan to select men of unusual ability and give them<br />\nevery possible aid in becoming leaders in their profession. Today,<br />\nthoughtful people of financial means realize that it is wise to aid<br />\nexceptional students to pursue their training without carrying an added<br />\nburden of financial worry. Under the influence of able teachers these<br />\nstudents are gathered here to be trained along special lines. The Uniersity is again pioneering. Under Dr. Neil E. Gordon, holders of<br />\nfellowships from all over the United States will be trained to take<br />\nplaces among leaders in chemical education. To his many other contributions to chemical education, Mr. Garvin, has added this one.<br />\nChemistry in general and the Johns Hopkins University in particular,<br />\nowe him a debt of gratitude.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nThe Medical School is also celebrating the completion of two major<br />\nprojects. The formal opening of the Wilmer Opthalmological Institute<br />\nis an outstanding contribution to the Medical School, Hospital and<br />\nAmerican medicine in general. Here diseases of the eye are being<br />\nstudied and numbers of sufferers are daily aided in the dispensary.<br />\nA monument to the executive ability of Dr. William H. Welch, the<br />\nWelch Medical Library stands completed.<br />\nThere is perhaps no more beloved figure in American medicine than<br />\nDr. Welch. Over seventy, he remains keen and active and it is through<br />\nhis efforts that the Library has been built. For over a year Dr. Welch<br />\nwandered, literally wandered, about Europe buying books everywhere<br />\nto put on the shelves of the new building. From everywhere volumes<br />\ncame back to Baltimore testifying to the enthusiastic interest with<br />\n\u2022 which Dr. Welch was plunging into this new project. Backed with<br />\nthis youthful enthusiasm, the Library has been completed. Here students<br />\nwill find that physical comfort so conducive to mental concentration.<br />\nUndergraduates though not actually concerned with these steps of<br />\nprogress should not remain oblivious of their completion.<br />\nThese events are much in the nature of a very special birthday<br />\ncelebration and no loyal son of the University should neglect the event.<br />\n<br />\nPOLITICS<br />\nelections has always brought ward politics and<br />\n<br />\nHE season of class<br />\nThigh<br />\npressure salesmanship prominently into the foreground of<br />\noppor-<br />\n<br />\ncampus activities. No other activity of the year brings so much<br />\ntunity for shady deals and selfish alliances. It is to the lasting discredit<br />\nof any organization which lets itself be made a party to elections of<br />\npurely political nature; that is, elections in which the evidently superior<br />\ncandidate is defeated by so-called combines of rival factions.<br />\nIn many cases, in fact, most instances, candidates are evenly matched.<br />\nAt such times there can be no harm in \"playing politics\" to put across<br />\nyour man. The evils of the presentstate of affairs result in dissatisfaction with the whole system when such evils are allowed to exceed reasonable limits. No honor accrues to any group which elects an inferior<br />\ncandidate over a superior one backed by a rival organization of less<br />\npower.<br />\nTo play politics is not objectionable when the spirit of fair play is<br />\nnot violated.<br />\nP. W.

For<br />\nseven years, the magazine, edited<br />\nby college students and recent graduates, has held a mirror to college<br />\nlife; the files for those years are a<br />\ncomplete history of higher education in a changing post-war era. In<br />\naddition to news, the magazine attempted to shape educational policy<br />\nin the direction of more student<br />\nfreedom and initiative against the<br />\ngoose step methods. It succeeded in<br />\nmaking ardent friends and bitter<br />\nenemies among professors, administrators, and alumni by its forthright championing of progressive educational methods in every<br />\noccasion.\"<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\n\"The New Student.\"<br />\n<br />\nthe team's poor playing was the<br />\nlack of team play and lack of faith<br />\nin each other.

Garvin Chair of Chemical<br />\nthe selection and education of chemi-<br /><br />\ninauguration of the new plan for<br />\ncal students. In continuance of its past record of high achievement,<br />\nthe Chemistry Department takes another step forward. Congratulations<br />\nare in order.<br />\nIn this present age of high pressure methods the field of science<br />\nrequires men whose training is more than superficial. The new scheme<br />\nplanned by Dr. Neil E. Gordon and made possible by the generosity<br />\nof Francis P. Garvin, the most prominent lay chemist of today, will go<br />\nfar toward turning out men qualified to meet the increasingly complex<br />\nproblems confronting chemistry. The men selected to pursue their<br />\ntraining here at Hopkins are supposedly of unusual ability and are to<br />\nbe trained to take places in educating the chemists of tomorrow.<br />\nThough we shall probably not find any genius such as pseudo-scientist<br />\nEdison recently attempted to discover, it is, nevertheless, within the<br />\nmeans of this plan to select men of unusual ability and give them<br />\nevery possible aid in becoming leaders in their profession. Today,<br />\nthoughtful people of financial means realize that it is wise to aid<br />\nexceptional students to pursue their training without carrying an added<br />\nburden of financial worry. Under the influence of able teachers these<br />\nstudents are gathered here to be trained along special lines. The Uniersity is again pioneering. Under Dr. Neil E. Gordon, holders of<br />\nfellowships from all over the United States will be trained to take<br />\nplaces among leaders in chemical education. To his many other contributions to chemical education, Mr. Garvin, has added this one.<br />\nChemistry in general and the Johns Hopkins University in particular,<br />\nowe him a debt of gratitude.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nThe Medical School is also celebrating the completion of two major<br />\nprojects. The formal opening of the Wilmer Opthalmological Institute<br />\nis an outstanding contribution to the Medical School, Hospital and<br />\nAmerican medicine in general. Here diseases of the eye are being<br />\nstudied and numbers of sufferers are daily aided in the dispensary.<br />\nA monument to the executive ability of Dr. William H. Welch, the<br />\nWelch Medical Library stands completed.<br />\nThere is perhaps no more beloved figure in American medicine than<br />\nDr. Welch. Over seventy, he remains keen and active and it is through<br />\nhis efforts that the Library has been built. For over a year Dr. Welch<br />\nwandered, literally wandered, about Europe buying books everywhere<br />\nto put on the shelves of the new building. From everywhere volumes<br />\ncame back to Baltimore testifying to the enthusiastic interest with<br />\n\u2022 which Dr. Welch was plunging into this new project. Backed with<br />\nthis youthful enthusiasm, the Library has been completed. Here students<br />\nwill find that physical comfort so conducive to mental concentration.<br />\nUndergraduates though not actually concerned with these steps of<br />\nprogress should not remain oblivious of their completion.<br />\nThese events are much in the nature of a very special birthday<br />\ncelebration and no loyal son of the University should neglect the event.<br /><br />\nPOLITICS<br />\nelections has always brought ward politics and<br /><br />\nHE season of class<br />\nThigh<br />\npressure salesmanship prominently into the foreground of<br />\noppor-<br /><br />\ncampus activities. No other activity of the year brings so much<br />\ntunity for shady deals and selfish alliances. It is to the lasting discredit<br />\nof any organization which lets itself be made a party to elections of<br />\npurely political nature; that is, elections in which the evidently superior<br />\ncandidate is defeated by so-called combines of rival factions.<br />\nIn many cases, in fact, most instances, candidates are evenly matched.<br />\nAt such times there can be no harm in \"playing politics\" to put across<br />\nyour man. The evils of the presentstate of affairs result in dissatisfaction with the whole system when such evils are allowed to exceed reasonable limits. No honor accrues to any group which elects an inferior<br />\ncandidate over a superior one backed by a rival organization of less<br />\npower.<br />\nTo play politics is not objectionable when the spirit of fair play is<br />\nnot violated.<br />\nP.

In<br />\naddition to news, the magazine attempted to shape educational policy<br />\nin the direction of more student<br />\nfreedom and initiative against the<br />\ngoose step methods.
