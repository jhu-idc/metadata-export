The Student Council is entirely<br />\njustified in its action and the only men who are at fault in the whole<br />\ntransaction have been those very same students who are now complaining so loudly. The Student Council gave the freshmen and<br />\nsophomores all the chance they could to attend assemblies voluntarily.<br />\nWhen their lenient policy failed, due to the lack of cooperation on<br />\nthe part of the members of the lower classes, they took stringent measures as the only policy left open to them.<br />\nAs long as we have weekly assemblies at Hopkins they must be<br />\nwell attended.

Suffice to say that it is self-evident to those who have the<br />\ninterests of the reputation of Johns Hopkins at heart. If one grants<br />\nthem that every speaker must have an audience he must also grant that<br />\nare only two ways of securing that audience; men must either attend<br />\nwillingly, or be forced to attend.

There have been active forces at work this year to push<br />\nstudent activities over the wrong side of the fence. The men who will<br />\nbe chosen to lead the activities next year will do much to determine<br />\ntheir fate.<br />\nThere are certain qualities which are necessities for any man who<br />\nhas the desire to head a college activity. He must have good judgment first of all. He must be able to choose, to accept, to reject. He<br />\nmust be able to do good work himself. He must be able to organize<br />\nhis staff. These qualities have been important in the past and are<br />\nequally so now, but there is one other characteristic that the heads of<br />\nthe activities during the year 1930-31 must cultivate and that is .the<br />\nability to make the word on their activity attractive.<br />\nEvery activity on the Hopkins campus needs men and will need<br />\nthem more next year. The editors of the publications and the presidents of the clubs must learn to draw forth candidates and to make<br />\nthose candidates work. They must learn to keep their own activity in<br />\nthe spotlight in order to re-awaken campus activity. Otherwise activities at Hopkins will fall into disrepute and finally be abandoned.<br />\nWe advise the present heads of activities to recommend for next<br />\nyear's offices men who will have the power of attracting freshmen to<br />\ntheir work.

The Student Council is entirely<br />\njustified in its action and the only men who are at fault in the whole<br />\ntransaction have been those very same students who are now complaining so loudly. The Student Council gave the freshmen and<br />\nsophomores all the chance they could to attend assemblies voluntarily.<br />\nWhen their lenient policy failed, due to the lack of cooperation on<br />\nthe part of the members of the lower classes, they took stringent measures as the only policy left open to them.<br />\nAs long as we have weekly assemblies at Hopkins they must be<br />\nwell attended.

Suffice to say that it is self-evident to those who have the<br />\ninterests of the reputation of Johns Hopkins at heart. If one grants<br />\nthem that every speaker must have an audience he must also grant that<br />\nare only two ways of securing that audience; men must either attend<br />\nwillingly, or be forced to attend.

There have been active forces at work this year to push<br />\nstudent activities over the wrong side of the fence. The men who will<br />\nbe chosen to lead the activities next year will do much to determine<br />\ntheir fate.<br />\nThere are certain qualities which are necessities for any man who<br />\nhas the desire to head a college activity. He must have good judgment first of all. He must be able to choose, to accept, to reject. He<br />\nmust be able to do good work himself. He must be able to organize<br />\nhis staff. These qualities have been important in the past and are<br />\nequally so now, but there is one other characteristic that the heads of<br />\nthe activities during the year 1930-31 must cultivate and that is .the<br />\nability to make the word on their activity attractive.<br />\nEvery activity on the Hopkins campus needs men and will need<br />\nthem more next year. The editors of the publications and the presidents of the clubs must learn to draw forth candidates and to make<br />\nthose candidates work. They must learn to keep their own activity in<br />\nthe spotlight in order to re-awaken campus activity. Otherwise activities at Hopkins will fall into disrepute and finally be abandoned.<br />\nWe advise the present heads of activities to recommend for next<br />\nyear's offices men who will have the power of attracting freshmen to<br />\ntheir work.
