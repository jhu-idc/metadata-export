To each and every one of that<br />\nplucky twelve we take off our hats,<br />\nproud to do homage to the champions of the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\n.<br />\nIn another part of this issue a detailed account of the game with Swarthmore, which<br />\ngave us indisputable claim to the championship laurels, is dealt with. Here, we merely<br />\nwish to put in our congratulations to Captain Meyer's men, who, fighting against<br />\nstrong teams and fearful odds, have put<br />\nHopkins where she was three years ago--at<br />\nthe head in lacrosse.<br />\nEarly in the season, Tough, the crack<br />\ncentre, injured one of his thumbs so badly<br />\nthat he was kept out of several of the games.<br />\nBefore the Harvard game, MacSherry, one<br />\nof the most aggressive players Hopkins ever<br />\nhad, was compelled to withdraw from the<br />\ngame. Raleigh, who had been playing in<br />\ngreat form during the early part of the season, sustained, a severe injury to his ankle<br />\nbefore the Stevens game, and was kept out<br />\nof the scrimmage until the Swarthmore<br />\ngame. In spite of these discouraging setbacks, the team never once shook. The older<br />\nmen worked all the harder, and the Freshmen on the team, realizing the responsibility<br />\nplaced upon their shoulders, did almost phenomenal work.<br />\nThis is the kind of grit<br />\nthat makes men; and when it is coupled with<br />\nthe clean play characteristic of our athletes,<br />\nthe University need not fear to give all her<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nteams support. And indeed, from the size<br />\nof the crowd which attended the Swarthmore game, it is evident that not only the<br />\nstudents, who attended in a large number,<br />\nbut the entire community have determined to<br />\ngive Hopkins' teams support.<br />\nIn closing, we would like also to tender<br />\nour congratulations to Manager Crane, who<br />\nran the team splendidly this year; and also<br />\nto the scrubs, without whom the team could<br />\nnever have attained the excellence it did.<br />\nHE election of the Musical Clubs' officers for next season has just taken<br />\nplace, and perhaps this is a good time<br />\nto say a few words about this organization.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs have not been entirely<br />\nsuccessful this year. Although the management was excellent, a heavy debt from last<br />\nyear handicapped all activity; and what is<br />\nworse, a steady diminution of interest has<br />\nsprung up among the undregraduates. Just<br />\nwhere the fault lies we will not attempt to<br />\nsay: it is perhaps true that the performances<br />\nof the clubs recently have not been up to the<br />\nstandard; but the purpose of this article is<br />\nan urgent appeal to every undergraduate to<br />\nremember what the Musical Clubs mean in<br />\nstudent life at Hopkins, and try his best to<br />\nassist in rebuilding them. Men of musical<br />\nability must realize that it is their solemn<br />\nduty to come out for the clubs. We could<br />\nname half a dozen men who, for no good reason, refused to do so this year. This matter<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhas been urged sufficiently, however, and<br />\nnow it is up to the undergraduates. No one<br />\nquestions the importance of the athletic<br />\nteams; but let everyone realize that, in their<br />\nway, the Musical Clubs stand for fully as<br />\nmuch in college life.<br />\nF course every undergraduate is glad<br />\nto hear that the much talked of four<br />\nyear course will become a fact next<br />\nyear. The numbers of the students will be<br />\nincreased, and with this increase, the power<br />\nof the student body to conduct its various<br />\nactivities will be more effective; and better<br />\nstill, every man will now enjoy an extra year<br />\nat good old Hopkins.<br />\nApart from these considerations, the work<br />\nhas undoubtedly been too severe. To do four<br />\nyears' work in three is an accomplishment<br />\nwhich not everyone can come up to. Several<br />\nyears ago a man came down with the intention of getting through in two years. He<br />\nwas brilliant, and he brilled ; just now he is<br />\nbrilling at the Shepherd Asylum. Things<br />\nof this sort will be done away with by the<br />\ncoming change, and the barbarism of making<br />\na man work eight afternoons a week in the<br />\nlaboratories is also to be abolished.<br />\nThe only fault which theNzws-LETTER has<br />\nto find with the new system is that there are<br />\ntoo many loopholes left by which a man can<br />\ncreep through in three years. Special precautions should have been taken to prevent<br />\n\"grinds\" from doing this. There will be<br />\nplenty of work for four years, if a man is<br />\ngoing to do it well. We also regret to see<br />\nthat it has not yet been realized that counting a term lasting three months as being<br />\nequal to one lasting four weeks is ridiculous<br />\nand unjust.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nWith but two exceptions, the papers presented at the Political Science Seminary during the year 1905-06 have related to current<br />\nand unsettled questions in international law<br />\nand diplomacy, and, especially, to those arising out of the Russo-Japanese War.<br />\nIn addition to the regular University work,<br />\nProfessor Willoughby has devoted considerable time to perfecting arrangements for the<br />\nappearance in November of the first number<br />\nof the American Political Science Review, of<br />\nwhich he is the managing editor. This Review is to be a quarterly, will be the organ<br />\nof the American Political Science Association, and will be the only journal published<br />\nin this country devoted exclusively to the<br />\ndiscussion of topics and the review of literature in the field of Political Science.<br />\n.1.1==.11M11\u20221<br />\n<br />\nLL last week we had many visitors to<br />\nMcCoy Hall to see the Maryland<br />\nMilk Exhibition, which was in continuation of the lectures on \"Milk,\" given<br />\nat Hopkins during the week of February 20,<br />\nunder the direction of the State Board of<br />\nHealth.<br />\nThis exhibition was held by the<br />\nBoard of Health in conjunction with the<br />\nSanitary Live Stock Board, the Maryland<br />\nAgricultural Experimental Station and other<br />\nassociations. Though this University had no<br />\ndirect control of the exhibition, yet, indirectly, it was very deeply interested in the movement. Dr. William H.

First, ability; secondly, application;<br />\nthirdly, quantity of work turned in. From<br />\nthese stipulations, it is evident that there is<br />\na chance for men starting in now to work<br />\nfor a place. A strict account is kept of t1.1<br />\nquality of work done by each candidate, and<br />\nthis account will be the supreme judge.<br />\nWe would advise 1908 to get busy.

In our quiet countryside<br />\nthe simple villagers and farmers drill<br />\ntheir wheat in the fall; feed their stock in<br />\nthe winter; plant their corn in the spring;<br />\nharvest their wheat in the summer; make<br />\ntheir hay a little later; shuck their corn; and<br />\nthen begin again on the treadmill of duties,<br />\nyear after year, until their sensibilities have<br />\nbeen calloused, and they have become like<br />\ntheir own plow animals. They have besides<br />\ntheir crops, the weather, and the Federal<br />\ngovernment, one topic of conversation\u2014the<br />\nOccupant of Gray Lawns.<br />\nGray Lawns is a rambling, gray, plastered<br />\nhouse of many wings and gables with a gray,<br />\nplastered wall around it. I suppose the wall<br />\nsomewhat piques the curiosity of the neighbors, and I myself have been much impressed<br />\nby the mystery which the farm hands have<br />\nconjured up. As a child I used to steal off<br />\non summer afternoons, when I was supposed<br />\nto be taking a nap, climb the hills, sheepeaten to the grass roots, and look curiously<br />\nat the strange old house, from whose chimneys one column of gray smoke rose steadily,<br />\nsummer and winter.<br />\nThe occupant of Gray Lawns did not farm<br />\nhis land. He kept a fine flock of sheep which<br />\nhe cared for himself. Nor did he employ<br />\nanyone from the village to help him, either as<br />\na servant or a laborer of any sort. Hence<br />\nthere was added to the tale of the Master of<br />\nGray Lawns another damning link of suspicion, that his only laborer on the farm was<br />\n\u2022<br />\na gray collie.<br />\nIt seemed rather peculiar that no one had<br />\never seen the Occupant of Gray Lawns in<br />\n'company with his dog. This is the stranger<br />\nsince a collie is one of the most affectionate<br />\nof dogs and is never better pleased than<br />\nwhen heeling his master's footsteps. Whenever the sheep were to be folded, the dog<br />\ninvariably went out and rounded them up,<br />\nand they disappeared behind the corner of<br />\nthe sheep house. There are those who said<br />\nthey had frequently seen the dog start out<br />\nfrom the house and disappear over the hill-<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nside and never return, while perhaps threequarters of an hour afterward the Master<br />\nwould come back to the house without ever<br />\nhaving been seen to leave it.<br />\nIn truth the man in the gray house was<br />\nvery chary of showing himself at all. Many<br />\na time, though, I have seen him hastily<br />\nspringing along the muddy roads with the<br />\nagility of a monkey, his body leaning well<br />\nforward and his gray cape streaming out behind, and I have felt no little trepidation in<br />\nseeing him vanish over the hill. Again I<br />\nhave seen him against the sun, as it set behind the ridge of the hills, and felt as if in<br />\nthat galloping figure of his there was some<br />\nwild imprisoned spirit of a loup-garou or a<br />\nwere-wolf. And I have run home shivering<br />\nto my nurse.<br />\nIt was in the lambing time, I remember,<br />\nwhen our kitchen was full of motherless and<br />\nshivering lambs, that Bob, our negro stockman, came in and took down the rifle, an<br />\nold muzzle-loading affair, and loaded it with<br />\nwhat he called a charmed bullet\u2014one with<br />\na cross on it. Not only that, but he tore out<br />\nthe whole book of Genesis from the Bible and<br />\nused it for wadding in the gun. When I<br />\nasked him what it was for, he said that the<br />\ndogs were after the sheep.<br />\n\"But,\" I repeated,\"what has the charmed<br />\nbullet and the Bible wadding to do with it?\"<br />\n\"Strange doin's, honey\u2014strange doin's!\"<br />\nwas all I could get from him.<br />\nThe next time I saw the dog, the gray collie, he limped in his left hind leg. The next<br />\ntime I saw the Occupant of Gray Lawns, he<br />\nalso limped in his left foot. The two were<br />\nscarcely ever seen afterwards. The depredations among the sheep were continuing in<br />\nviolence and cruelty, but, strange to say,<br />\nthe sheep of the Master of Gray Lawns were<br />\never untouched.<br />\nOne night Bob came in rubbing his hands<br />\nin great glee. \"I done fix him this time,<br />\nsure. I done fix him. I seen him eat de<br />\npisin. I seen from de top o' de hill and then<br />\nhe done make straight for de big house.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe next day a band of irate farmers with<br />\nshot guns went to the Gray Lawns to demand<br />\nthat the dog be killed, if he were not already<br />\ndead, and that further, the Occupant of the<br />\nGray Lawns should make proper payment to<br />\nthe sheep owners of the community. They<br />\nraised a tremendous racket at all the doors,<br />\nand failing to arouse attention from within,<br />\nfinally broke into the house. There was a<br />\nfire smoldering on the hearth, a smell of sulphur and brimstone, but no one was on the<br />\nbottom floor. They mounted to the second.<br />\n<br />\nIn a large, dark room there stood a fourposter with drawn curtains. They opened<br />\nthe curtains gingerly.

First of all, some of them met us<br />\nat the train and went with us to the hotel.<br />\nThen a good bunch went over to the game<br />\nand rooted hard, and finally, the \"old boys\"<br />\nentertained us at dinner at the New York<br />\nAthletic Club.

Certainly the Hopkins spirit is not extinct among the older men. That was shown<br />\nat the dinner, when old and new Hopkins<br />\nsongs were sung, and toasts to the team<br />\ndrunk.<br />\nThe dinner was very attractively served,<br />\nand tasted mighty good to fellows who had<br />\nbeen in training that week.

The final game which decided the championship was played at Mt.<br />\nWashington last Saturday, between Johns<br />\nHopkins and Swarthmore, and resulted in a<br />\nvictory for the Black and Blue.<br />\nLittle need be told of the game itself, for<br />\nevery loyal Hopkins man knows, or should<br />\nknow, the story of it. It was certainly one<br />\nof the closest and hardest games that a Hopkins team has ever had a share in. From the<br />\ntime the ball was faced-off, until the whistle<br />\nblew at the end of the game, it was go, go,<br />\ngo, all the time. There was no let-up in the<br />\nfast, grueling pace. When one thinks that<br />\nthe halves were thirty-five minutes each, one<br />\ncan realize the condition of the players at<br />\nthe end. Hopkins managed to keep always<br />\nin the lead by at least one point, but it was<br />\nall they could do to do it. Had it not been<br />\nfor some beautiful stops on the part of<br />\nBlanck, Hopkins' goalkeeper, the score<br />\nmight have been different.<br />\nIt is difficult to say that any single player<br />\nexcelled, for every man on the Hopkins team<br />\ngave all he had. Dill, by hard running, wore<br />\nhimself completely out, but he demonstrated<br />\nthe necessity for a team to have a fast third<br />\ndefense, who can run down on the attack<br />\nwhen an extra man is needed. This was<br />\nDill's last game for Hopkins, but by no<br />\nmeans his least. As said before, the whole<br />\nteam, from Raleigh to Blanck, played their<br />\nbest, and gave all they had to give.<br />\nSwarthmore had us beat on condition in<br />\nthe second half, but several of the old men<br />\nwere heard to say that they thought Hopkins' team work was better than that of the<br />\nex-champions. Even Crowell, Swarthmore's<br />\nin-home of last year, said that the score did<br />\nnot show how much better the Black and<br />\nHowever that may be,<br />\nBlue team was.<br />\nSwarthmore put up a rattling hard game,<br />\n<br />\nand made Hopkins work as they had not<br />\nworked before this season. It was a great<br />\ngame to win, and a hard game to lose.<br />\nThe Hopkins team deserved to win. If<br />\never a team worked hard, it was the team of<br />\n1906. Let us hope that the team of 1907 will<br />\nbe as fortunate as that of 1906, and that next<br />\nyear another banner may be hung upon the<br />\nwalls of the trophy room.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS-STEVENS.<br />\nOn Friday, May 4, the lacrosse team traveled to Hoboken, and on the following<br />\nafternoon defeated Stevens Institute by the<br />\nscore of 4 to 2. The game was, by all odds,<br />\nthe hardest that the team had had up to that<br />\ndate. Stevens started off with a rush that<br />\nshook our defense somewhat, and gave them<br />\nthe first point. Only a moment later, however, Dill tied the score for Hopkins. Some<br />\nfew minutes later Stevens scored their seeond and last goal. It was more or less of a<br />\nfluke, for the ball was thrown over from behind goal, and, in the scrimmage which followed, was swept in.<br />\nThen the rain commenced, and then it<br />\npoured. Through the downpour one could<br />\nnot recognize his own players. Play was<br />\nsuspended until the shower stopped. The<br />\nfield, which had been very sandy before,<br />\nwas now drowned under mud puddles.<br />\nHopkins started in with a vim and Frank<br />\ntied the score just before the end of the first<br />\nhalf. In the second half the good condition<br />\nof Hopkins' men told wonderfully. The two<br />\nwinning goals were scored in this half, and<br />\nhard play figured with both teams, partieularly around the Hopkins' goal, where<br />\nBlanck made some beautiful stops.<br />\nAltogether, the game was an exceedingly<br />\nhard one, and every Hopkins man was glad<br />\nwhen the whistle blew. Tough got in the<br />\ngame in the last half, and, being fresh, was<br />\na great help. Dill, Erlanger, Blanck, Hudginsi and Knipp all played very well.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nJOHN HOPKINS WON.<br />\nBaltimoreans Jubilant Because of their Victory<br />\nOver Virginia.<br />\n(Special to The Washington Post.)<br />\n<br />\nCharlottesville, Va., May 12.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nEarned runs\u2014Johns Hopkins, 1.

The<br />\nintroduction contains not only an account of<br />\nthe composition and contents of the play,<br />\nand a critical discussion of the piece, but it<br />\nalso gives ample information concerning the<br />\nhistorical background and all the plexus of<br />\nfact and fancy which Schiller wove together.<br />\nThe notes and vocabulary are very full, and<br />\nthe appendix, containing sixteen poems bearing on the play, is very interesting. Tschudi,<br />\nthe historian, from whom Schiller drew so<br />\nlargely, is quoted at length.

At the same time<br />\nit will cultivate literary appreciation and develop some knowledge of rhetorical theory.<br />\nThe book is essentially modern and practical<br />\nin its character. In Part One are given the<br />\nelements of description, narration, exposition, and argument, together with special<br />\nchapters on letter-writing and poetry. A<br />\nmore complete and comprehensive treatment<br />\nof the four forms of discourse already discussed is furnished in Part Two. In each<br />\npart there is presented a series of theorems<br />\ncovering these subjects, each theorem introducing a single new principle. The pupils<br />\nare taught how to correct their own errors,<br />\nand careful co-ordination with the study of<br />\nliterature and with other school studies distinguishes the book. The modern character<br />\nof the illustrative extracts cannot fail to interest every pupil. An extensive appendix<br />\ncontains the elements of form, the figures of<br />\nspeech, etc. A complete index renders aid<br />\nin ready reference.<br />\nWHENYOU<br />\nTHINK OF...<br />\n<br />\nTRAVEL ANYWHERE<br />\n-CONSULT---<br />\n<br />\nARTHUR WROBSON,<br />\n127 E.

To each and every one of that<br />\nplucky twelve we take off our hats,<br />\nproud to do homage to the champions of the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\n.<br />\nIn another part of this issue a detailed account of the game with Swarthmore, which<br />\ngave us indisputable claim to the championship laurels, is dealt with. Here, we merely<br />\nwish to put in our congratulations to Captain Meyer's men, who, fighting against<br />\nstrong teams and fearful odds, have put<br />\nHopkins where she was three years ago--at<br />\nthe head in lacrosse.<br />\nEarly in the season, Tough, the crack<br />\ncentre, injured one of his thumbs so badly<br />\nthat he was kept out of several of the games.<br />\nBefore the Harvard game, MacSherry, one<br />\nof the most aggressive players Hopkins ever<br />\nhad, was compelled to withdraw from the<br />\ngame. Raleigh, who had been playing in<br />\ngreat form during the early part of the season, sustained, a severe injury to his ankle<br />\nbefore the Stevens game, and was kept out<br />\nof the scrimmage until the Swarthmore<br />\ngame. In spite of these discouraging setbacks, the team never once shook. The older<br />\nmen worked all the harder, and the Freshmen on the team, realizing the responsibility<br />\nplaced upon their shoulders, did almost phenomenal work.<br />\nThis is the kind of grit<br />\nthat makes men; and when it is coupled with<br />\nthe clean play characteristic of our athletes,<br />\nthe University need not fear to give all her<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nteams support. And indeed, from the size<br />\nof the crowd which attended the Swarthmore game, it is evident that not only the<br />\nstudents, who attended in a large number,<br />\nbut the entire community have determined to<br />\ngive Hopkins' teams support.<br />\nIn closing, we would like also to tender<br />\nour congratulations to Manager Crane, who<br />\nran the team splendidly this year; and also<br />\nto the scrubs, without whom the team could<br />\nnever have attained the excellence it did.<br />\nHE election of the Musical Clubs' officers for next season has just taken<br />\nplace, and perhaps this is a good time<br />\nto say a few words about this organization.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs have not been entirely<br />\nsuccessful this year. Although the management was excellent, a heavy debt from last<br />\nyear handicapped all activity; and what is<br />\nworse, a steady diminution of interest has<br />\nsprung up among the undregraduates. Just<br />\nwhere the fault lies we will not attempt to<br />\nsay: it is perhaps true that the performances<br />\nof the clubs recently have not been up to the<br />\nstandard; but the purpose of this article is<br />\nan urgent appeal to every undergraduate to<br />\nremember what the Musical Clubs mean in<br />\nstudent life at Hopkins, and try his best to<br />\nassist in rebuilding them. Men of musical<br />\nability must realize that it is their solemn<br />\nduty to come out for the clubs. We could<br />\nname half a dozen men who, for no good reason, refused to do so this year. This matter<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nhas been urged sufficiently, however, and<br />\nnow it is up to the undergraduates. No one<br />\nquestions the importance of the athletic<br />\nteams; but let everyone realize that, in their<br />\nway, the Musical Clubs stand for fully as<br />\nmuch in college life.<br />\nF course every undergraduate is glad<br />\nto hear that the much talked of four<br />\nyear course will become a fact next<br />\nyear. The numbers of the students will be<br />\nincreased, and with this increase, the power<br />\nof the student body to conduct its various<br />\nactivities will be more effective; and better<br />\nstill, every man will now enjoy an extra year<br />\nat good old Hopkins.<br />\nApart from these considerations, the work<br />\nhas undoubtedly been too severe. To do four<br />\nyears' work in three is an accomplishment<br />\nwhich not everyone can come up to. Several<br />\nyears ago a man came down with the intention of getting through in two years. He<br />\nwas brilliant, and he brilled ; just now he is<br />\nbrilling at the Shepherd Asylum. Things<br />\nof this sort will be done away with by the<br />\ncoming change, and the barbarism of making<br />\na man work eight afternoons a week in the<br />\nlaboratories is also to be abolished.<br />\nThe only fault which theNzws-LETTER has<br />\nto find with the new system is that there are<br />\ntoo many loopholes left by which a man can<br />\ncreep through in three years. Special precautions should have been taken to prevent<br />\n\"grinds\" from doing this. There will be<br />\nplenty of work for four years, if a man is<br />\ngoing to do it well. We also regret to see<br />\nthat it has not yet been realized that counting a term lasting three months as being<br />\nequal to one lasting four weeks is ridiculous<br />\nand unjust.<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nWith but two exceptions, the papers presented at the Political Science Seminary during the year 1905-06 have related to current<br />\nand unsettled questions in international law<br />\nand diplomacy, and, especially, to those arising out of the Russo-Japanese War.<br />\nIn addition to the regular University work,<br />\nProfessor Willoughby has devoted considerable time to perfecting arrangements for the<br />\nappearance in November of the first number<br />\nof the American Political Science Review, of<br />\nwhich he is the managing editor. This Review is to be a quarterly, will be the organ<br />\nof the American Political Science Association, and will be the only journal published<br />\nin this country devoted exclusively to the<br />\ndiscussion of topics and the review of literature in the field of Political Science.<br />\n.1.1==.11M11\u20221<br /><br />\nLL last week we had many visitors to<br />\nMcCoy Hall to see the Maryland<br />\nMilk Exhibition, which was in continuation of the lectures on \"Milk,\" given<br />\nat Hopkins during the week of February 20,<br />\nunder the direction of the State Board of<br />\nHealth.<br />\nThis exhibition was held by the<br />\nBoard of Health in conjunction with the<br />\nSanitary Live Stock Board, the Maryland<br />\nAgricultural Experimental Station and other<br />\nassociations.

In our quiet countryside<br />\nthe simple villagers and farmers drill<br />\ntheir wheat in the fall; feed their stock in<br />\nthe winter; plant their corn in the spring;<br />\nharvest their wheat in the summer; make<br />\ntheir hay a little later; shuck their corn; and<br />\nthen begin again on the treadmill of duties,<br />\nyear after year, until their sensibilities have<br />\nbeen calloused, and they have become like<br />\ntheir own plow animals. They have besides<br />\ntheir crops, the weather, and the Federal<br />\ngovernment, one topic of conversation\u2014the<br />\nOccupant of Gray Lawns.<br />\nGray Lawns is a rambling, gray, plastered<br />\nhouse of many wings and gables with a gray,<br />\nplastered wall around it. I suppose the wall<br />\nsomewhat piques the curiosity of the neighbors, and I myself have been much impressed<br />\nby the mystery which the farm hands have<br />\nconjured up. As a child I used to steal off<br />\non summer afternoons, when I was supposed<br />\nto be taking a nap, climb the hills, sheepeaten to the grass roots, and look curiously<br />\nat the strange old house, from whose chimneys one column of gray smoke rose steadily,<br />\nsummer and winter.<br />\nThe occupant of Gray Lawns did not farm<br />\nhis land. He kept a fine flock of sheep which<br />\nhe cared for himself. Nor did he employ<br />\nanyone from the village to help him, either as<br />\na servant or a laborer of any sort. Hence<br />\nthere was added to the tale of the Master of<br />\nGray Lawns another damning link of suspicion, that his only laborer on the farm was<br />\n\u2022<br />\na gray collie.<br />\nIt seemed rather peculiar that no one had<br />\never seen the Occupant of Gray Lawns in<br />\n'company with his dog. This is the stranger<br />\nsince a collie is one of the most affectionate<br />\nof dogs and is never better pleased than<br />\nwhen heeling his master's footsteps. Whenever the sheep were to be folded, the dog<br />\ninvariably went out and rounded them up,<br />\nand they disappeared behind the corner of<br />\nthe sheep house. There are those who said<br />\nthey had frequently seen the dog start out<br />\nfrom the house and disappear over the hill-<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nside and never return, while perhaps threequarters of an hour afterward the Master<br />\nwould come back to the house without ever<br />\nhaving been seen to leave it.<br />\nIn truth the man in the gray house was<br />\nvery chary of showing himself at all. Many<br />\na time, though, I have seen him hastily<br />\nspringing along the muddy roads with the<br />\nagility of a monkey, his body leaning well<br />\nforward and his gray cape streaming out behind, and I have felt no little trepidation in<br />\nseeing him vanish over the hill. Again I<br />\nhave seen him against the sun, as it set behind the ridge of the hills, and felt as if in<br />\nthat galloping figure of his there was some<br />\nwild imprisoned spirit of a loup-garou or a<br />\nwere-wolf. And I have run home shivering<br />\nto my nurse.<br />\nIt was in the lambing time, I remember,<br />\nwhen our kitchen was full of motherless and<br />\nshivering lambs, that Bob, our negro stockman, came in and took down the rifle, an<br />\nold muzzle-loading affair, and loaded it with<br />\nwhat he called a charmed bullet\u2014one with<br />\na cross on it. Not only that, but he tore out<br />\nthe whole book of Genesis from the Bible and<br />\nused it for wadding in the gun. When I<br />\nasked him what it was for, he said that the<br />\ndogs were after the sheep.<br />\n\"But,\" I repeated,\"what has the charmed<br />\nbullet and the Bible wadding to do with it?\"<br />\n\"Strange doin's, honey\u2014strange doin's!\"<br />\nwas all I could get from him.<br />\nThe next time I saw the dog, the gray collie, he limped in his left hind leg. The next<br />\ntime I saw the Occupant of Gray Lawns, he<br />\nalso limped in his left foot. The two were<br />\nscarcely ever seen afterwards. The depredations among the sheep were continuing in<br />\nviolence and cruelty, but, strange to say,<br />\nthe sheep of the Master of Gray Lawns were<br />\never untouched.<br />\nOne night Bob came in rubbing his hands<br />\nin great glee. \"I done fix him this time,<br />\nsure. I done fix him. I seen him eat de<br />\npisin. I seen from de top o' de hill and then<br />\nhe done make straight for de big house.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe next day a band of irate farmers with<br />\nshot guns went to the Gray Lawns to demand<br />\nthat the dog be killed, if he were not already<br />\ndead, and that further, the Occupant of the<br />\nGray Lawns should make proper payment to<br />\nthe sheep owners of the community. They<br />\nraised a tremendous racket at all the doors,<br />\nand failing to arouse attention from within,<br />\nfinally broke into the house. There was a<br />\nfire smoldering on the hearth, a smell of sulphur and brimstone, but no one was on the<br />\nbottom floor. They mounted to the second.<br /><br />\nIn a large, dark room there stood a fourposter with drawn curtains. They opened<br />\nthe curtains gingerly. The Occupant of Gray<br />\nLawns was dead!<br />\nThe gray collie has never been seen again<br />\nand the attacks on our flocks have ceased for<br />\nthe most part. But whenever there is an inexplicable sheep killing, the old gossips in<br />\nthe village look wise and say, \"It's him of<br />\nthe Gray Lawns.\"<br /><br />\nRESOLVED!<br />\nWhereas:<br />\nIt has been noted with much grief and<br />\nsurprise, that the tacks, intended and supposed to hold down the seats of the chairs<br />\nin the department of English Literature, are<br />\nnot each and every one doing its allotted<br />\nduty;<br />\nWhereas:<br />\nOne of these said tacks did willfully and<br />\nmaliciously tear and rip a pair of trousers<br />\nworn by a member of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nBoard;<br />\nWhereas:<br />\nAccording to the Book of Proverbs,<br />\n\"Sharp tacks run deep.\"<br />\nBe it Resolved:<br />\nThat the Janitor and the official Tackhammer be appointed and constituted a committee of two, with full and unlimited powers, to examine each and every one of these<br />\nsaid tacks, intended and supposed to hold<br />\ndown the said seats of the said chairs of the<br />\nsaid department of English Literature, and<br />\nto see that each and every one is driven to<br />\nits duty.<br /><br />\nPIERROT'S LOVES.<br />\n\"I love you,\" says poor young Pierrot;<br />\n\"0, no, you don't,\" says Columbine,<br />\n\"I know you love another.\"<br />\nPierrot'a face saddens into woe,<br />\n\"Won't you be mine, and only mine?\"<br />\n\"I'll have you for my brother.\"<br />\n\"Then tell me who my true loves are<br />\n\"A Scottish lass and a Cuban maid,<br />\nThose are your loves, Pierrot, I trow.<br /><br />\n\"Gay Cigarette's more yours by far;<br />\nKing William's daughter, I'm afraid,<br />\nOr even some buxom Munchener Frau.\"<br />\n* a * * *<br />\nL'ENVOI.<br />\n\"Truth!

The final game which decided the championship was played at Mt.<br />\nWashington last Saturday, between Johns<br />\nHopkins and Swarthmore, and resulted in a<br />\nvictory for the Black and Blue.<br />\nLittle need be told of the game itself, for<br />\nevery loyal Hopkins man knows, or should<br />\nknow, the story of it. It was certainly one<br />\nof the closest and hardest games that a Hopkins team has ever had a share in. From the<br />\ntime the ball was faced-off, until the whistle<br />\nblew at the end of the game, it was go, go,<br />\ngo, all the time. There was no let-up in the<br />\nfast, grueling pace. When one thinks that<br />\nthe halves were thirty-five minutes each, one<br />\ncan realize the condition of the players at<br />\nthe end. Hopkins managed to keep always<br />\nin the lead by at least one point, but it was<br />\nall they could do to do it. Had it not been<br />\nfor some beautiful stops on the part of<br />\nBlanck, Hopkins' goalkeeper, the score<br />\nmight have been different.<br />\nIt is difficult to say that any single player<br />\nexcelled, for every man on the Hopkins team<br />\ngave all he had. Dill, by hard running, wore<br />\nhimself completely out, but he demonstrated<br />\nthe necessity for a team to have a fast third<br />\ndefense, who can run down on the attack<br />\nwhen an extra man is needed. This was<br />\nDill's last game for Hopkins, but by no<br />\nmeans his least. As said before, the whole<br />\nteam, from Raleigh to Blanck, played their<br />\nbest, and gave all they had to give.<br />\nSwarthmore had us beat on condition in<br />\nthe second half, but several of the old men<br />\nwere heard to say that they thought Hopkins' team work was better than that of the<br />\nex-champions. Even Crowell, Swarthmore's<br />\nin-home of last year, said that the score did<br />\nnot show how much better the Black and<br />\nHowever that may be,<br />\nBlue team was.<br />\nSwarthmore put up a rattling hard game,<br /><br />\nand made Hopkins work as they had not<br />\nworked before this season. It was a great<br />\ngame to win, and a hard game to lose.<br />\nThe Hopkins team deserved to win. If<br />\never a team worked hard, it was the team of<br />\n1906. Let us hope that the team of 1907 will<br />\nbe as fortunate as that of 1906, and that next<br />\nyear another banner may be hung upon the<br />\nwalls of the trophy room.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS-STEVENS.<br />\nOn Friday, May 4, the lacrosse team traveled to Hoboken, and on the following<br />\nafternoon defeated Stevens Institute by the<br />\nscore of 4 to 2. The game was, by all odds,<br />\nthe hardest that the team had had up to that<br />\ndate. Stevens started off with a rush that<br />\nshook our defense somewhat, and gave them<br />\nthe first point. Only a moment later, however, Dill tied the score for Hopkins. Some<br />\nfew minutes later Stevens scored their seeond and last goal. It was more or less of a<br />\nfluke, for the ball was thrown over from behind goal, and, in the scrimmage which followed, was swept in.<br />\nThen the rain commenced, and then it<br />\npoured. Through the downpour one could<br />\nnot recognize his own players. Play was<br />\nsuspended until the shower stopped. The<br />\nfield, which had been very sandy before,<br />\nwas now drowned under mud puddles.<br />\nHopkins started in with a vim and Frank<br />\ntied the score just before the end of the first<br />\nhalf. In the second half the good condition<br />\nof Hopkins' men told wonderfully. The two<br />\nwinning goals were scored in this half, and<br />\nhard play figured with both teams, partieularly around the Hopkins' goal, where<br />\nBlanck made some beautiful stops.<br />\nAltogether, the game was an exceedingly<br />\nhard one, and every Hopkins man was glad<br />\nwhen the whistle blew. Tough got in the<br />\ngame in the last half, and, being fresh, was<br />\na great help. Dill, Erlanger, Blanck, Hudginsi and Knipp all played very well.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nJOHN HOPKINS WON.<br />\nBaltimoreans Jubilant Because of their Victory<br />\nOver Virginia.<br />\n(Special to The Washington Post.)<br /><br />\nCharlottesville, Va., May 12.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nEarned runs\u2014Johns Hopkins, 1.
