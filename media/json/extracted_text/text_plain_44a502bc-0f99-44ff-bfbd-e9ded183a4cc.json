To the average American, Ireland is a picturesque little<br />\nisland where the people spend their time getting drunk, speaking with odd'<br />\naccents, and talking about funny soap with green specks in it.<br />\nFew realize the actual historical and cultural importance of Ireland. For<br />\nexample, very few know that between the fall of the Roman Empire and<br />\ntile rise of culture in Renaissance Italy, it was Ireland that kept the lamps<br />\nk)-1: learning lit in Europe. Fewer still would even believe that it was the<br />\nIrish who introduced divining to poetry. And even those aware of<br />\nIreland's recent literaiv import are not fully aware of Irchind's literary<br />\nheritage.<br />\nTo begin with, St. Patrick was not important to just Ireland, he was<br />\nimportant to the whole of Northern Europe. The conversion of Ireland led<br />\niirectly to the conversion of :the rest of Northern Europe, as Ireland<br />\nbecame an important point for sending out missionaries. To give sonic<br />\nIdea of how many missionaries Ireland sent out, the Schedae de islandia of<br />\nAra Multiscilus list 150 Irish saints who were sent to Germany, 45 to<br />\nGaul, 30 to Belgium, 44 to England. 13 to Italy, and 8 to Norway and<br />\nIceland. In addition to this, there were over one hundred monasteries<br />\noun ded outside of Ireland by these mission iries .Iii i strong sense, St.<br />\nPatrick's cLiy celebNites the introduction of Christitnity to most of<br />\nNorthern Europe.<br />\nAnother reason for ikt hcans to be enthusiastic about St. Patrick's<br />\nDay is that there is reasonable evidence to support the theory that<br />\nAmeriCa was visitie&by St. Brendan is early as the cigth century AD.<br />\nThere is a tradition iliong the northmcn, that is, the Vikings and their<br />\nt.lan Vineland, which<br />\ndescendants,-t- hat tlotiWaS a region farther SouthI<br />\nthey called irlaod cI inikla (Ireland the great). There is also a<br />\ncorresponding tradition among American Indians.<br />\nSimultaneously, Ireland maintained what were amost the only schools<br />\nin Europe which dealt with Classic Literature. One need only point to the<br />\nBook of Kells ;Is an example of the mere craftsmanship of Ireland's<br />\nAbbeys. This book, which is considered by many to be the finest example<br />\nof illuminated manuscripts in existence, probably dates back to the eigth \u2022<br />\ncentury: what in Europe from that period could equal it?<br />\nIrish scholarship from the eighth to the tenth centuries was supreme ill<br />\nEurope. During thi.s period, anyone North of central Italy who read Greek<br />\nWas either Irish or taught by one, Towns such as Aix, Tours, Marseilles,::<br />\nSalzburg and St. Gall are heavily indebted to the Irish for their cultural<br />\norigins -- in fact. the Irish Missionaries responsible for theowns arc tihi<br />\nmentioned in those towns' benediction rites.<br />\nIn iddition, the indigenous Celtic liteniture Uftt e an has been classed<br />\neqwil to thtl\"lifq121-e- Greeks. Although only<br />\ny many scholars<br />\nrecently recognized, the ancient sagas carry as strong a sense of character<br />\nand insight into the human condition as any of the Greek myths, and<br />\ncertainly more than the Norse sagas. Perhaps the best modern examples of<br />\nthe eloquence of Irish mythology are Yeats' poems based on them.<br />\nIt was this Celtic literature which 'also introduced the concept of<br />\n<br />\nrhymed verse to literature. Perhaps because of the inherent musical sense<br />\nof the Irish, perhaps because of the exquisite fluidity and expressiveness<br />\n.of Gaelic, the Celtic poets in Ireland were employing an advanced form of<br />\nrhymed verse as early.: as the eighth century, when the first Arabic<br />\nexamples appeared.<br />\nWhat then happened to the Irish? How it that a nation so proud, so<br />\npowerful could be so fallen, so weak? One may be tempted to point out<br />\nthat neither Greece, Rome, Israel or Italy are major powers at present,<br />\neven though they were at one time the centers of the world's civilization.<br />\nBut an analogy is not an acceptable explanation.<br />\nTo be blunt, what happened to Ireland was England.<br />\nIt would be pointless to fully trace the history of Irish subjugation by<br />\nthe English: for our purposes let us start with Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell,<br />\nLord Protector of England, protestant despot and murderer of Charles I.<br />\ndid not take kindly to the fact that most of Ireland was Catholk. It was<br />\nnot enough for him that most of Ireland's land had been given over to<br />\nEnglishmen as political plums (e.g., Sir Walter Raleigh, who introduced<br />\nthe potato to Ireland). It was not enough that an Irishman was not<br />\nallowed to own a horse not worth more than six pence.<br />\nCromwell was fond of such things as laying siege to Irish towns, and<br />\nslaughtering Irish Catholics, \"in the name of God.\" Cromwell was fond of<br />\nselling Irish women and children into slavery.<br />\nThings got worse. In a 'fight for the British crown, all of Ireland except<br />\nthe predominantly Protestant Ulster backed Otholic James: unfortunately,<br />\nthe Protestant William of Orange was victorious. Here is where the<br />\nprevious rivalry between Ulster and the rest of Ireland grew into a full<br />\nscale hatred. The Battle of the Boyne in 1,00, which was not the major<br />\nmilitary engagement of the war, still holds.'' rific emotional significance<br />\nfor Irishmen, symbolizing is it does Irchind last hope for parity with<br />\nCatholic England.<br />\nAnother shot at independence rose gloriously on Ireland's political<br />\nhorizon with the coining of Parnell, but even there, Ireland was met with a<br />\nfailure. Parnell, a gifted politician and even gifted orator, is considered<br />\ntoday to have been the only man capable of brining about a peaceful<br />\nindependence, but his disgrace through his illicit affair with Kitty O'Shea<br />\nproved fatal politically.<br />\nFinally in 1916, Ireland gained her self respect, and in 1918, her<br />\nindependence. Yet after almost eight hundred years of progressive English<br />\nsubjugation, Ireland is not a world power by any means.<br />\nNone the less, Ireland's contributions have been immense. In the field<br />\nof writing, most of the great English language writers of the past eighty,<br />\nyears have been Irish. One is hardprcssed to think of greater writers, poets,<br />\nor dramatists than William Bader Yeats, lames Joyce, George Bernard<br />\nShaw, Samuel Beckettt, Oscar Wilde or Brendan Behan. In fact, one is<br />\nrather hardpressed to think of an English-born\u2022 writer of the period of<br />\neqiuil status.<br />\nHere in America, though, the average Irilbinan is characterized as a<br />\nil, and eager to kill people<br />\n'<br />\nheavy drinking Catholic, who is poor, boastril<br />\nover some stupid religious difference. Because it is common to read how<br />\nmany people have been killed in the last three years of sectarian strife in<br />\nNorthern Ireland it is easy to be oblivious of the fact that more people<br />\nhave been killed in civil disturbances in Jamaica than Northern Ireland<br />\nduring the same period of time, and that the Christian vs. Moslem war in<br />\nLebanon has claimed more lives in a year than violence in Northern<br />\nIreland has in the last five. Nor do most people realize that the society in<br />\nNorthern Ireland is structured against Catholics as solidly as Mississippi<br />\nwas structured against blacks in the fifties.<br />\nRather than think of the Irish as drunkards, blowing up whatever they<br />\ncan, think of them as a people dispossessed of the homeland. Better still,think of them as the much abused, oft-forgotten cornerstone of modern<br />\nEurope. \u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/march 18, 1977.<br />\n<br />\nCongresswoman Shirley Chisholm:<br />\nFull of outrage and sorrow<br />\n<br />\nBy MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nShirley Chisholm, the first black congresswoman in<br />\nAmerica, represents a New York district which includes<br />\nBedford-Stuyesant, one of the nation's largest ghettoes.<br />\nThe 52-year-old Chisholm became a national political<br />\nfigure in 1972 when she made a presidential bid and<br />\nreceived 152 delegate votes. Speaking March 9 at the<br />\nCollege of Notre Dame on the topic \"Women and Work in<br />\nAmerica: Then and Now,\" Mrs. Chisholm displayed an<br />\nintense awareness of \"the unwillingness of our society to<br />\nallow women to share in the American dream.\"<br />\nThere is a pattern to American history, contended<br />\nChisholm, which explains how we 'arrived at a<br />\ndiscriminatory system of laws. Early colonial laws were<br />\nbased on English common law, in which women were<br />\nproperty, and early American legal documents were much<br />\nthe same: \"The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were<br />\nwritten by and for men.- In American history books<br />\nthere is little mention of women, those who played<br />\ncrucial roles in the growth of the West and of cities.<br />\nChisholm traced the ways in which discriminatory work<br />\npractices, like many American history books, have made<br />\nsecond class citizens of women: \"Since work is a source<br />\n<br />\nof fulfillment and success, discrimination on the basis of<br />\nsex deprives women of one basic way to success.- Women<br />\nwere discouraged from working, were encouraged to stay<br />\nhome: Indeed, a woman interested in physical labor was a<br />\nsocial outcast.<br />\n\"Women had entered into the labor force at times<br />\nwhen the economy demanded it. [In World War Two]<br />\nwomen were welcomed into the factories and assembly<br />\nlines to produce nitions for war.\" But, when the war was<br />\nover, after women had proven their capacities, they were<br />\nsummarily pushed aside. It was no longer acceptable for<br />\nwomen to work, and many who wanted to work were<br />\nconsidered unpatriotic, because they deprived returning<br />\nsoldiers of jobs. \"That pattern has been reinforced in<br />\nevery aspect of our society.\"<br />\nChisholm compared the feminist movement of today<br />\nwith the Civil Rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's,<br />\nwhen large numbers of women, black and white,<br />\ndemanded equal rights for blacks. \"Out of this struggle we<br />\nput laws on the books. In doing so the federal government<br />\nhelped to end discrimination by race...Many women who<br />\nhad marched in Selma began to realize that discrimination<br />\non the basis of sex was just as dehumanizing, just as<br />\ndemoralizing, as discrimination on the basis of the color<br />\n<br />\nAn open<br />\nktter to<br />\nMartin<br />\nMandel<br />\n<br />\nDar Marvin:<br />\nWhen St. Patrick expelled tile snakes from Ireland, a<br />\nfew good swimmers in the lot widoubtedly made their.<br />\n.way to Maryland.

Rather, I am impelled t9 ask you, as a man<br />\nwho owes his livelihood and reputation (such as it is) to<br />\nthe Democratic Party, how you could be so disloyal and.<br />\ninconsiderate to the members of that party as to award a<br />\nlucrative and prestigious seat in the House of Delegates to \u2022<br />\na heathen Republican?

Chisholm feels, however, that \"the President is<br />\nmoving in the right direction. You will see [in the Carter<br />\nadministration] the greatest number of women that have<br />\never been selected in any administration of this country.<br />\nHe didn't put enough women on the top level, but at least<br />\nit's a beginning.<br />\n\"When I was making a bid for president I wanted a<br />\nmultifaceted cabinet, because that's America.\" Chisholm<br />\nstated to one of her opponents[left unnamed], that she<br />\nwanted Indians, women, and Blacks in her cabinet, to<br />\nwhich he replied: \"They aren't qualified.\" At that very<br />\nmoment she had three Indians, all with Ph.D.s. all<br />\nexperienced and intelligent women under consideration<br />\nfor Secretary of the Interior. Chisholm went and did some \u2022<br />\nresearch, looked into the qualifications and records of<br />\nsome of the men who have been put into that office in<br />\nthis century, and one need hardly add that 'she was not<br />\nuplifted by what she found.<br />\nShirley Chisholm was full of outrage and sorrow<br />\nbecause of the \"tremendous waste of physical and<br />\npsychical energy that could be given to ameliorate<br />\nhumanity.

We've<br />\ncooperated with the FBI, we've kept from publicly<br />\ncriticizing the FBI, but we're not further along in the<br />\ninvestigation now than we were six months ago.\"-Michael<br />\nMoffitt<br />\nMichael Moffitt is an angry young man and there's a<br />\ngood reason why. It's been over six months now since<br />\nMoffitt's wife Ronni and former Chilean ambassador<br />\nOrlando Letelier were assassinated on Washington's<br />\nEmbassy Row. Over six months and still the FBI has<br />\nfailed to capture their killers.<br />\nAnd it's not as if the FBI is short on leads. In fact,<br />\nMoffitt and his co-workers at the Institute for Policy<br />\nStudies [IPS] have provided investigators with the names<br />\nand addresses of the men they say planted the bomb in<br />\nLetelier's car last September.<br />\n\"We have evidence that the assassination was ordered<br />\nby DINA [Chile's secret police] and carried out by six<br />\nCuban ex`iles, all veteran terrorists, who are now living in<br />\nFlorida,\" claims Moffitt. The FBI has been given this<br />\ninformation but refuses to act on it, looking instead for<br />\nnon-political motives for the killings. The most frustrating<br />\npart, says Moffitt, is that the FBI knows that IPS is right<br />\nbut still won't do anything.<br />\nA possible key link in the case is Orlando Bosch, a<br />\nterrorist with DINA affiliations, who is now in jail in<br />\nVenezuela. Moffitt believes that Bosch could let go with<br />\nsome valuable talk if only the FBI would make the effort.<br />\n\"We've been told time and time again that they're<br />\nready to move on the case, and now they say they're<br />\nstymied. Does someone else have to get their head blown<br />\noff to show the FBI that DINA isn't kidding around?\"<br />\nMoffitt commented. Failing immediate action from the<br />\nFBI, IPS may call for a special congressional investigation<br />\ninto the murders, although considering Congress' track<br />\nrecord on that score, not many are optimistic about the<br />\nresults of such an investigation.<br />\n\"This assassination is a direct outgrowth of U.S. foreign<br />\n<br />\npolicy since World War II. The CIA has been trying to<br />\ndestroy progressive movements in Third World countries<br />\ncommitted to social change for years now,\" Moffitt said.<br />\nThe people of Chile join those of Iran, Brazil, Vietnam<br />\nand a host of other countries who have been savagely<br />\nvictimized by American imperialism since World War II.<br />\nIt's no secret that a public airing of this murder probe<br />\nwould do little to bolster the flagging image of the CIA<br />\nmainly because of its close ties with DINA and other<br />\nforeign secret police netwprds. Exactly what the Cia role<br />\nin the Letelier assassination is remains unclear, but<br />\naccording to Moffitt, \"It's inconceivable that foreign<br />\npolice are carrying out illegal activities in the United<br />\nStates without the CIA knowing about them.\" It's also no<br />\nsecret that the Cuban gunmen were CIA-trained. So, it's<br />\nnot hard to figure out why the FBI is dragging its feet on<br />\nthe investigation.<br />\nAnd there's no indication that this terrorism will stop.<br />\n\"A person I know is said to be on DINA's hit list, he's<br />\nbeen harrassed and followed, but we still can't get police<br />\nprotection for him or any other Chilean,\" stated Moffitt.<br />\nRelations between the United States and Chile are<br />\nbound to be less friendly during Jimmy Carter's<br />\nadministration, but whether the Chilean Junta is given a<br />\nwrist-slapping or is dealt with morel severely remains to be<br />\nseen. Moffitt's unsure about Carter's position , saying<br />\n\"It's another case of him promising something during the<br />\ncampaign and not knowing whether he'll act on it.\"<br />\nMoffitt added that the Chilean government was<br />\ndisappointed when Carter nosed out Ford last November<br />\nbecause they think he's \"too dangerous\" and \"too far to<br />\nthe left.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, DINA agents are busier than ever, stalking<br />\naround Washington,. checking out campuses, tracking<br />\ndown and harrassing: Chileans disloyal to the Junta.

I realize, too, that<br />\nmany people are of the attitude<br />\nthat the world is a sad place if<br />\nothers cannot bear a few laughing<br />\nslights against them, e.g. the<br />\nPolish, Italian, etc.,joke.<br />\nHowever, I am confused as to<br />\nthe purpose of Mr. Colin Camerer<br />\nin his \"article\" of 3-8-77. Is he<br />\nwriting news, social commentary,<br />\nor satire? I do not find it<br />\nnewsworthy, legitimate, or<br />\nlaughable. I find it appalling and<br />\npitiful in its backward prejudice<br />\nand false sense of superiority. Mr.<br />\nCamerer, in his piece on the<br />\nEvening College, has found it<br />\nnecessary to include derogatory<br />\ndescriptions of Jews, nurses, and<br />\nhousewives, and to downgrade<br />\nand patronize a segment of the'<br />\nuniversity that truly deserves<br />\nplaudits, not put-downs.<br />\nA great many people have<br />\nconsiderable respect for those<br />\nworking adults who have the<br />\ncourage and motivation to return<br />\nto school at the expense of their<br />\nfree time. These students are<br />\nsincere, intelligent, and eager to<br />\nbe accepted, yet they are often<br />\nhampered by the attitudes of<br />\ncertain undergraduates such as<br />\nMr. Camerer, who seems to view<br />\nthem as ridiculous. Mr. Camerer<br />\nhas examined his subjects<br />\nthrough stereotypic. rather than<br />\n<br />\nrose-colored, glasses.<br />\nStereotyping is passe, Mr.<br />\nCamerer. It is not entertaining.<br />\nI question Mr. Camerer's taste<br />\nin wishing to have such an article<br />\npublished, and 1 question the<br />\ntaste of the News-Letter in<br />\nchoosing to publish it. I was<br />\nasked why I bother to respond to<br />\nsuch garbage. It is because I<br />\nexpect garbage to be tossed out.<br />\nArna Cohen<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nDon't you . wonder sometimes<br />\nabout sound and visiOn?<br />\ndo<br />\n<br />\nBy JOHN PERROTTA<br />\nLife at Johns Hopkins in the nineteenth century was<br />\ndefinitely a different scene. With no Rathskellar, 110<br />\nHomewood campus, no University housing, and only a<br />\nhandful of Goucher girls, the typical Hopkins student was<br />\nin for the trip of his life.<br />\nThe new University, thrusting all its resources in the<br />\ndirection of academics and research, had neither the<br />\nmoney nor the need for a dormitory. Fortunately for<br />\nthem, many Baltimoreans wee still suffering the effects<br />\nof the Civil War and the Depression of 1873. TheY<br />\nwelcomed both Peabody and Hopkins students into their<br />\nhomes as boarders.<br />\nSo many students settled near McCulloh and Biddle<br />\nStreets that this area was christened the Latin Quarter. It<br />\nwas quiet with old brick houses later praised by Hopkins<br />\nalumnus Woodrow Wilson in a letter to his sweetheart.<br />\nIf Johns Hopkins is world-famous today,it certainly<br />\nwasn't known by all Baltimoreans in the 1880's. Indeed.<br />\nnot until the Hospital began treating patients did<br />\n\"Hopkins\" become a household word. A Johns Hopkins<br />\nstudent, placing an ad in the Baltimore Sun for a room<br />\n\"near the University\", was offered a room near the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland medical school.<br />\nLiving was pretty cheap. Rooms were usually $5 a<br />\nmonth. Meals went for $4 a week, or that much a<br />\nfortnight if you cooked them yourself. Milk was 3 cents a<br />\nglass, apples, two for a nickel. Twelve bananas could be<br />\nhad for 8 cents at the Lexington Market. And kerosene to<br />\nfuel your study lamp was a quarter a month.<br />\nHerbert Baxter Adams (of Adams House fame) claimed<br />\nthat cutting corners in Germany, it still cost him $1000 a<br />\nyear. However, a student in Baltimore could live \"on the<br />\nfat of the land\" for $500 a year, and that he himself paid<br />\n<br />\nAl<br />\niger<br />\n<br />\npioul<br />\nfold<br />\n<br />\nlii<br />\nIf<br />\nbeen<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\nSt<br />\nfust<br />\n<br />\n1-1(<br />\n<br />\nfOrti<br />\n<br />\nfic<br />\n<br />\ny<br />\n<br />\nth p<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\neid<br />\n<br />\nhelp<br />\n<br />\n4.41<br />\n<br />\nheir<br />\n<br />\nPr<br />\n<br />\nEgg Roll Norton<br />\nDear Mr. Camerer:<br />\nRe: your tongue in cheek article<br />\nconcerning evening students.<br />\nThere is one important factor<br />\nyou didn't mention that may<br />\nhelp explain the mysterious<br />\ndifferences you noted between<br />\nday<br />\nand evening students.

The first pledge class journeyed<br />\nt\u00b0h Yale where they were initiated at President Gilman's<br />\nPter of the fraternity. Later, more fraternities came<br />\nexistence. Frat houses were more social than<br />\nential: only a few graduate students lived there, to<br />\nheelP pay the rent and thus maintain a fraternity<br />\nad quarters. Frat-community relations were a problem<br />\nthen, and landlords often evicted fraternities from<br />\ne_tr tow houses.<br />\nFrat athletics and hazing were unheard of until the late<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n1890's. But other activities, especially rushing, got out of<br />\nhand when brothers sought pledges from the nearby boys<br />\nprep schools.<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa was Hopkins' only honorary fraternity<br />\nat the turn of the century. President Gilman was<br />\nappointed its first chairman. Admission into Phi Beta<br />\nKappa required a unanimous vote, a rule which, due to a<br />\ncertain woman-hater alumnus, kept several .co-cd: from<br />\nmembership.<br />\nSince there was no gymnasium, itchy students turned<br />\nto recreational facilities in the city. The Baltimore<br />\nAthletic Club promised to waive the initiation fee of any<br />\nstudent provided he pay the one dollar monthly dues. The<br />\nUniversity chartered a horse-drawn wagon which brought<br />\nboys to clifton, the estate of Mr. Johns Hopkins, where<br />\nthey could play on the open lawns.<br />\nIn 1882 Edward Hartwell was appointed the Hopkins'<br />\nfirst physical education instructor. A year later a small<br />\ngym equipped with lockers, bath, and offices was<br />\nconstructed. Tennis courts were laid in the yard area. A<br />\nfootball team was organized in 1881, lacrosse in 1882. As<br />\nsports grew at Hopkins, it was obvious the present<br />\ngymnasium was inadequate. In 1898 row houses were<br />\ndemolished, and a new,larger gym was erected.<br />\nIn 1876 a club, modeled after the German kneipe, or<br />\ntavern, was organized for Saturday night get-togethers. The<br />\nstudents played cards, chess, smoked (cigarettes), drank<br />\nbeer, and sang German and Latin songs led by the<br />\nclassicist Basil Gildersleeve. Later the group established a<br />\nregular meeting hall in the back room of a grocery store.<br />\nSaint Dennis, a black man, tended the fire and<br />\noccasionally crossed the street to buy refreshments for the<br />\nstudents. In ten years the kneipe gave way to a more<br />\norganized Johns Hopkins University Club with Professor<br />\nGildersleeve presiding. Unfortunately undergraduates<br />\nwere screwed again as membership was limited to those<br />\ntwenty-five and over. Thus, many students had to seek<br />\nthrills elsewhere.<br />\nThe first society formed solely in the interests of the<br />\nundergraduates was the Matriculate Society. Their<br />\nopening dance--or \"hop\", as it was appropriately<br />\ncalled \u2014was held on Commemoration Day, 1887, in the<br />\ngymnasium. Due to its success, the hops were held on<br />\nother occasions. Despite the fact that Goucher College<br />\nallowed only girls living with their parents to attend the<br />\nhops, there were usually enough \"locals\" on hand to<br />\ndance with.<br />\n<br />\nOld Administration building<br />\nThe theatre was almost untouched by Hopkins<br />\nstudents before the turn of the century. .The only<br />\ndramatic production on record is a minstral show by the<br />\nlight-hearted local fraternity, Alpha Sigma Sigma (ASS)<br />\nin 1890. The two hundred dollar profit from ticket sales<br />\nwas donated to the Athletic Association.<br />\nThe first Glee Club was formed in 1879 and enjoyed a<br />\nvery short life. In 1883 another Glee Club was organized,<br />\nwith tenor Woodrow Wilson among its first members. But<br />\na banjo and mandolin club formed five years later was so<br />\n'popular that it knocked the Glee Club out of prominence.<br />\nSoon this new music club, equipped with singers,<br />\nperformed concerts in Maryland and other states. Several<br />\nstudents, perhaps realizing their true talents, never<br />\nreturned to the University. This, along with a faculty fed<br />\nup with banjo practice in the classrooms, caused music to<br />\nabruptly stop at Hopkins. Is wasn't until almost the end<br />\nof the century that a new music group, incorporating glee,<br />\nbanjo, and mandolin, was organized.<br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory of Music always attracted<br />\nHopkins students. They were known even to cut class(or<br />\nseminars, as they were called) to see a performance. The<br />\ntheatre too, offered top-quality entertainment: Booth,/<br />\nJefferson, Rossi.<br />\nIn 1897 a music appreciation club was formed.<br />\nConcerts were performed in the original McCoy Hall<br />\ndowntown, under the direction of the Peabody<br />\nConservatory of Music.

Well, the JFX does not look<br />\ntoo promising, but don't give up on that general direction. There happens to be a place named Long John's<br />\nPub that sits on the tail end of West 29th, across from Sterling's, yet.<br />\nLong John's is as good a spot as any to drown out the sorrows of shut-down Maryland race tracks. In<br />\nfact, this bar rates a cut above the average Greenmount or Hampden saloon, at least in terms of decor.<br />\nTables with non-plastic green tablecloths. Candles that have fishnet patterns around their glass containers.<br />\nSwivel-action leather bar stools and a deluxe giant TV screen.<br />\nPlushness, however, is a double-edged sword in drinking establishments. The ritzy style at Long<br />\nJohn's\u2014as one patron conjectured. \"the owners must just be little homebodies\"\u2014tends to preclude a sense<br />\nof locale, of Baltimore turf. The bar could be uprooted and transplanted anywhere along the Eastern<br />\nseaboard without the blink of an eyelash. During football season, Colt highlight films and Monday night<br />\ngames aroused loyalty; nowadays, a bare Oriole poster hangs on the wall to remind one of the city.<br />\nThe \"notch-above\" atmosphere fortunately does not bring along higher prices. Tuborg Gold goes for<br />\nforty cents a draft, a very modest expense. And Happy Hour from five to six (Monday through Thursday)<br />\nfeatures a nickel off the beer and mixed drinks for forty cents. To get food, show up sometime in the<br />\nafternoon for standard grill fare; at night, pizzas are served until 11:30. Those who complain of an absence<br />\nof Nathan's in the area should check out the Monday night special: hot dogs for a quarter apiece.<br />\nThe physical proportions inside Long John's also set it apart from the neighborhood taverns. A very long<br />\nbar cuts a large \"L\" in the room, leaving relatively small space for tables. Most of the patrons, then, sit at<br />\nthe bar, which doesn't make for the crowds about the tables usually seen at other places. Instead, this is one<br />\nplace the reviewer can trot out that favored word\u2014\"intimacy.\"<br />\nFor some action, the jukebox suffers from an overdose of country tunes, though a Buddy Holly number<br />\nof \"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling\" may be found. A couple \"new\" pinball machines (one is Captain<br />\nFantastic) stand along one wall, a rarity in these parts\u2014most bars carry the old-style machines that lack<br />\nflipper, points, and any apparent redeeming social value. The real game connoiseur will be delighted to find<br />\na miniature electronic bowling alley, where one slides a metal disc to knock down the pins. Several different<br />\ngames can be played, all for a long-lasting quarter for two contestants. And anyone who scores over 199 on<br />\nthe \"Regular\" version may receive a welcome surprise one Friday (ask the bartender for details).<br />\nLong John's will probably seem unfamiliar to the seasoned local barg..,er, what with its higher-class<br />\ninterior and close surroundings. Like any good bar, however, a few rounds and words with the regulars will<br />\nmake one feel right at home in Charm City.<br />\n2<br />\n--Sizuff'y Sandlot<br />\n<br />\nDiNiNq IN BALTIMORE -- NATURAL<br />\nScirocco Restaurant, 3900 N. Charles<br />\nSt., is the most recent addition to thE<br />\nlimited list of natural food restaurants in<br />\nBaltimore. Unfortunate1y, it is not the<br />\nwonder it is advertised to be.<br />\nTo begin with, Scirrocco has an<br />\nidentity problem. Benevolent murals of<br />\nsmiling suns and friendly cacti are<br />\njuxtaposed with a well-stocked bar, over<br />\nwhich sits a plastic sign bearing the<br />\nrestaurant name. Waiters cheerfully<br />\nattired in Scirrocco T-shirts work with a<br />\nmaitre d' in a black three-piece suit, a<br />\nman who belongs more with the<br />\nfasionable establishment on the other side<br />\nof the partition.<br />\nThis peculiar split personality is also<br />\nreflected in the table settings and menu.<br />\nThe blue -checkered tablecloths are<br />\nprotected by a sheet of acrylic on which a<br />\ndirty little vase holds a few dried flowers.<br />\nThe course offerings vary from the<br />\ntraditional roast prime ribs of beef to'the<br />\nmore \"exotic\" and \"original\"<br />\nall-vegetable dishes.<br />\nDinner began with soup served in a<br />\ncup, a feature not mentioned on the<br />\nmenu. The fresh mushroom soup was<br />\nneither tasty nor fresh, and seemed<br />\nreheated. For one-fourth the price, a can<br />\nof Campbell's would have been more<br />\nplentiful and appetizing.<br />\nOur appetizers, mushroom caps stuffed<br />\nwith snails in garlic butter, were an<br />\nextreme disappointment. The few<br />\nmushroom slices floating in the soup<br />\ncame from larger mushrooms than those<br />\nused for appetizer. The taste of garlic<br />\nbutter was barely perceptible, and the<br />\ndecorative parsley limp beyond<br />\nrecognition.<br />\nOur main courses consisted of small<br />\nPortions of a curried vegetable dish<br />\nWithout curry (bearing a strange<br />\nresemblance to another dish on the<br />\nmenu), and a Ratatouille casserole. The<br />\nvegetables were generally unrecognizable<br />\nby taste or appearance, due to<br />\novercooking or continuous re-warming.<br />\nWhen the Ratatouille, which was cold on<br />\nthe inside, was returned, it came back<br />\nalmost immediately piping-hot, the plate<br />\n<br />\nPub<br />\n<br />\nstill manageable. This suggested the use of<br />\na micro-wave oven. Is this the \"natural<br />\ntaste of food\" that Scirrocco's boasts?<br />\nThe gastronomical highlight of the<br />\nevening was the bread, two honey-carrot<br />\nmuffins fresh from the oven, served at the<br />\nend of the meal.<br />\nThe establishment claims that \"every<br />\nmeal is prepared to your order.\" Is this<br />\nthe only excuse for slow service and<br />\ntemperamental cooks? There are no<br />\nchoices offered within any dish, and it<br />\nturned out to be difficult to distinguish<br />\none vegetarian item from another. The.<br />\nmenu differentiated by sauce, but the<br />\nchef didn't seem to go that far.<br />\nScirrocco is more expensive .and<br />\npretentious, and less imaginative than the<br />\nother natural food restaurants in the area.<br />\nThey are attempting to integrate healthy<br />\neating with middle-class standards: They<br />\nhave not succeeded\u2014they have only<br />\nmanaged to bring out the worst aspects of<br />\nboth realms.<br />\nPerhaps they should not have tried.<br />\n-- The Bobsey Twins<br />\n<br />\nSaturday past, several consorts and<br />\ntook a stroll down Little Italy way,<br />\nthought we'd eat well, drink well, and be<br />\nItalian for at least a night. Maybe longer.<br />\nWe would have been wiser to make the<br />\ntrek a bit later than dinner hour since<br />\nevery establishment of any repute in<br />\nLittle Italy sports round the black lines<br />\nfrom 6:30 to 7:00 weekend nights. We<br />\nwound up at Chiapparelli's 237 High St.,<br />\nand have yet to regret it.<br />\nThe wait was long -- maybe two hours -but the stand-up bar to the left of the<br />\nrestaurant was enough to settle our thirst,<br />\nenough to prime us for an exciting meal.<br />\nOur drinks were all delicious and then<br />\nsome: the Freddy Fudpucker had ample<br />\nevidence of tequila and the fresh banana<br />\nwas crushed just right. The gin and tonics,<br />\na popular drink at our quarter of the bar,<br />\nmet with thumbs up all around.<br />\nAll the appetizers were good, but the<br />\nclams casino was thG hit of the night.<br />\nClams casino like I've never had them;<br />\n<br />\nFood ANd LiTTEE !Tay<br />\n<br />\nhuge, tasty clams suffocated by a<br />\ntantalizing concoction of tomato, herbs<br />\nand breading. This taste treat is not to be<br />\nmissed. The entrees were all delightful, the veal<br />\ndishes drawing special praise. The<br />\nhighlight, however, was the Ed Perry's<br />\nShrimp and Clam Scampi, a mystical dish<br />\nthat begs not to be eaten, but just gazed<br />\nupon. Rarely in an Italian restaurant<br />\n[in any restaurant] have I come across a<br />\nscampi so fixed up with jumbo firm<br />\nshrimp and tender clams. Quite a<br />\nsensation, to say the least.<br />\nIn all fairness, one must admit that the<br />\ndeserts were a mixed bag. The spumoni<br />\nand tortoni were run of the mill affairs,<br />\nI've had better at the opening of a<br />\nsuburban Carvel. The cheese cake wasn't<br />\nbad, but a mistake after such a rich meal.<br />\nCoffee was fine.<br />\nChiaparelli's tariffs are a bit dear\u2014our<br />\nbill for seven came to $136, with several<br />\ndrinks apiece--but if you've got a few<br />\nbucks to spare there's no excuse not to<br />\nscoot on down to Chiaparelli's.<br />\nilthouglz some Baltimoreans will tell<br />\nyou otherwise, it is possible to get burned<br />\n<br />\nin Little Italy. We know that reality all<br />\ntoo well.<br />\nSergi 's Ice House doesn't look all that<br />\nbad from the outside, just a boring white<br />\nbuilding. I don't want to go on too long<br />\nabout this excuse for a restaurant, but as<br />\ne gastromme du peup1e, / feel compei!ed<br />\nto rake over a few details, ugly as they<br />\nare.<br />\nFor starters, the drinks were weak.<br />\nAlso tasted funny. The appetizers were<br />\npoor. Our main dishes varied, from the<br />\nmediocre\u2014ravioli, spaghetti and Italian<br />\nsausage- to the positively criminal. In that<br />\nlatter category were the chicken and veal<br />\nparmesan, which were both stretched out<br />\non huge plates like pancakes, a thin strip<br />\nof chicken or veal buried by greasy<br />\nbreading. The clams possillipo were<br />\nhopelessly lost amid an 'indifferent sauce.<br />\nThe salads hrere plain and limp, the<br />\nbread cold and slightly, stale, and the<br />\ncheesecake -too heavy. All this fur a stiff'<br />\nprice, at least ten dollars over what it<br />\ndeserved.'<br />\nI felt awful the rest of that day, and it<br />\nwasn't until I downed five Old<br />\nMilwaukees in Hansen 's Saloon that Ifelt<br />\nlike myself' again.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 12/news-letter/march 18, 1977<br />\n<br />\nTROOP]<br />\n<br />\nO_P-1<br />\n<br />\nOfig OPFR<br />\n<br />\n5_5_0<br />\n<br />\n13rea0<br />\n. 5-1wiihFjeienad...<br />\n<br />\nSATURDAY<br />\nIN THE RATHSKELLAR<br />\n<br />\nThs Sutiday<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\n- tfn \u2022<br />\n<br />\nRRst ENeUsg LuTRERAN ci4uRct4 HouGf<br />\n3803 N. ciur(es s+reet<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n-g<br />\nNONVERBAL COMMUNICATION STUDY<br />\nMen and women undergrads sought for(study on the<br />\ncommunication of feelings through nonverbal cues.<br />\nTakes about 90 minutes, pays $3.00.

The visitors<br />\nfrom New York state are defending National champions.<br />\nin Division II and, according to Homewood coach<br />\nHenry<br />\nCiccarone, \"play a gambling style of lacrosse that<br />\n(Hopkins) probably won't see too much of during the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nThe Jays had played sluggishly during the first quarter<br />\nof their previous two scrimmages, but such was not the<br />\ncase on Wednesday afternoon. Hopkins opened with a<br />\ntremendous rush and it looked as though Hobart would<br />\n'be run right off th6 field and clear across University<br />\nParkway.<br />\nJHU opened the scoring early in the opening period,<br />\nculminating a series of passes in which over half the team<br />\nmembers on the field had possession of the ball. After<br />\nmaking a save, goalie Kevin Mahon passed out to<br />\ndefenseman Mark Greenberg. Defenseman Leroy Katz,<br />\nattackman Mike O'Neill and midfielder Tom Myrick also<br />\nhad the ball before Doober Auburn fired home the game's<br />\nOpening goal.<br />\nOn the ensuing face-off, middie Bob Maimone got the<br />\nball to Dave Huntley. Huntley returned it to Maimone<br />\nand Bob put a 15-foot bullet past the helpless goalie.<br />\nMaimone notched his second goal of the contest minutes<br />\nlater and JHU held a 3-0 lead before Hobart knew what<br />\nhad hit them.<br />\nHowever, the visitors came storming back with three<br />\ngoals of their own to knot the score midway through t!<br />\n<br />\nquarter. This tie was shortlived as Huntley, Hirsch and<br />\nBob DeSimone scored for Hopkins before the period had<br />\nended and the Jays held a 6-3 lead after the game's first<br />\nfifteen minutes.<br />\nThe second quarter was marked by a definite letdown<br />\nin the pace of play, as compared with that in the first<br />\nperiod. Neither team played consistently well for any<br />\nlength of time and there was little sustained offense at<br />\neither end of the field. Both squads tallied a pair of goals<br />\napiece (DeSimone and Jon Swerdloff for JHU) giving<br />\nHopkins an 8-5 halftime bulge.<br />\nAs contrasted with their performance in the second<br />\nperiod, the Blue Jays' effort in the third quarter was<br />\nexcellent. The offense regained some of the life and style<br />\nit had exhibited in the opening quarter, while the defense,<br />\nsave for one mental lapse, totally shut down the Hobart<br />\nscoring machinery.<br />\nThe Jays outscored fheir visitors 4-1 in this third<br />\nfifteen minutes of action to take a commanding 12-6 lead<br />\ninto the fourth quarter. Swerdloff, a freshman from<br />\nBaltimore, paced the attack with a pair of goals.<br />\nThe game was no longer in doubt during the final<br />\nperiod, a situation that gave both coaches a chance to rest<br />\ntheir starters. Play became sloppy once again, although<br />\nthe scoring did not cease. The Jays added four goals to<br />\ntheir total, with Swerdloff having a goal and an assist to<br />\nbring his point total to five for his'afternoon's work.<br />\nCiccarone was not particularly happy with the team's<br />\noverall play, but did see aspects of the game that he hopes<br />\nto see continue.<br />\n\"I was pleased with the way we capitalized on some of<br />\ntheir defensive mistakes,\" the Coach noted. \"In addition,<br />\nour defense did a good job\u2014we gave them a few goals and<br />\nthen we shut the door.\"<br />\nConcerning Saturday's opponent, Yale, the third year<br />\n<br />\nmentor said, \"I don't know anything about them and that<br />\ncould be dangerous.

To the average American, Ireland is a picturesque little<br />\nisland where the people spend their time getting drunk, speaking with odd'<br />\naccents, and talking about funny soap with green specks in it.<br />\nFew realize the actual historical and cultural importance of Ireland. For<br />\nexample, very few know that between the fall of the Roman Empire and<br />\ntile rise of culture in Renaissance Italy, it was Ireland that kept the lamps<br />\nk)-1: learning lit in Europe. Fewer still would even believe that it was the<br />\nIrish who introduced divining to poetry. And even those aware of<br />\nIreland's recent literaiv import are not fully aware of Irchind's literary<br />\nheritage.<br />\nTo begin with, St. Patrick was not important to just Ireland, he was<br />\nimportant to the whole of Northern Europe. The conversion of Ireland led<br />\niirectly to the conversion of :the rest of Northern Europe, as Ireland<br />\nbecame an important point for sending out missionaries. To give sonic<br />\nIdea of how many missionaries Ireland sent out, the Schedae de islandia of<br />\nAra Multiscilus list 150 Irish saints who were sent to Germany, 45 to<br />\nGaul, 30 to Belgium, 44 to England. 13 to Italy, and 8 to Norway and<br />\nIceland. In addition to this, there were over one hundred monasteries<br />\noun ded outside of Ireland by these mission iries .Iii i strong sense, St.<br />\nPatrick's cLiy celebNites the introduction of Christitnity to most of<br />\nNorthern Europe.<br />\nAnother reason for ikt hcans to be enthusiastic about St. Patrick's<br />\nDay is that there is reasonable evidence to support the theory that<br />\nAmeriCa was visitie&amp;by St. Brendan is early as the cigth century AD.<br />\nThere is a tradition iliong the northmcn, that is, the Vikings and their<br />\nt.lan Vineland, which<br />\ndescendants,-t- hat tlotiWaS a region farther SouthI<br />\nthey called irlaod cI inikla (Ireland the great). There is also a<br />\ncorresponding tradition among American Indians.<br />\nSimultaneously, Ireland maintained what were amost the only schools<br />\nin Europe which dealt with Classic Literature. One need only point to the<br />\nBook of Kells ;Is an example of the mere craftsmanship of Ireland's<br />\nAbbeys. This book, which is considered by many to be the finest example<br />\nof illuminated manuscripts in existence, probably dates back to the eigth \u2022<br />\ncentury: what in Europe from that period could equal it?<br />\nIrish scholarship from the eighth to the tenth centuries was supreme ill<br />\nEurope. During thi.s period, anyone North of central Italy who read Greek<br />\nWas either Irish or taught by one, Towns such as Aix, Tours, Marseilles,::<br />\nSalzburg and St. Gall are heavily indebted to the Irish for their cultural<br />\norigins -- in fact. the Irish Missionaries responsible for theowns arc tihi<br />\nmentioned in those towns' benediction rites.<br />\nIn iddition, the indigenous Celtic liteniture Uftt e an has been classed<br />\neqwil to thtl\"lifq121-e- Greeks. Although only<br />\ny many scholars<br />\nrecently recognized, the ancient sagas carry as strong a sense of character<br />\nand insight into the human condition as any of the Greek myths, and<br />\ncertainly more than the Norse sagas. Perhaps the best modern examples of<br />\nthe eloquence of Irish mythology are Yeats' poems based on them.<br />\nIt was this Celtic literature which 'also introduced the concept of<br /><br />\nrhymed verse to literature. Perhaps because of the inherent musical sense<br />\nof the Irish, perhaps because of the exquisite fluidity and expressiveness<br />\n.of Gaelic, the Celtic poets in Ireland were employing an advanced form of<br />\nrhymed verse as early.: as the eighth century, when the first Arabic<br />\nexamples appeared.<br />\nWhat then happened to the Irish? How it that a nation so proud, so<br />\npowerful could be so fallen, so weak? One may be tempted to point out<br />\nthat neither Greece, Rome, Israel or Italy are major powers at present,<br />\neven though they were at one time the centers of the world's civilization.<br />\nBut an analogy is not an acceptable explanation.<br />\nTo be blunt, what happened to Ireland was England.<br />\nIt would be pointless to fully trace the history of Irish subjugation by<br />\nthe English: for our purposes let us start with Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell,<br />\nLord Protector of England, protestant despot and murderer of Charles I.<br />\ndid not take kindly to the fact that most of Ireland was Catholk. It was<br />\nnot enough for him that most of Ireland's land had been given over to<br />\nEnglishmen as political plums (e.g., Sir Walter Raleigh, who introduced<br />\nthe potato to Ireland). It was not enough that an Irishman was not<br />\nallowed to own a horse not worth more than six pence.<br />\nCromwell was fond of such things as laying siege to Irish towns, and<br />\nslaughtering Irish Catholics, \"in the name of God.\" Cromwell was fond of<br />\nselling Irish women and children into slavery.<br />\nThings got worse. In a 'fight for the British crown, all of Ireland except<br />\nthe predominantly Protestant Ulster backed Otholic James: unfortunately,<br />\nthe Protestant William of Orange was victorious. Here is where the<br />\nprevious rivalry between Ulster and the rest of Ireland grew into a full<br />\nscale hatred. The Battle of the Boyne in 1,00, which was not the major<br />\nmilitary engagement of the war, still holds.'' rific emotional significance<br />\nfor Irishmen, symbolizing is it does Irchind last hope for parity with<br />\nCatholic England.<br />\nAnother shot at independence rose gloriously on Ireland's political<br />\nhorizon with the coining of Parnell, but even there, Ireland was met with a<br />\nfailure. Parnell, a gifted politician and even gifted orator, is considered<br />\ntoday to have been the only man capable of brining about a peaceful<br />\nindependence, but his disgrace through his illicit affair with Kitty O'Shea<br />\nproved fatal politically.<br />\nFinally in 1916, Ireland gained her self respect, and in 1918, her<br />\nindependence. Yet after almost eight hundred years of progressive English<br />\nsubjugation, Ireland is not a world power by any means.<br />\nNone the less, Ireland's contributions have been immense. In the field<br />\nof writing, most of the great English language writers of the past eighty,<br />\nyears have been Irish. One is hardprcssed to think of greater writers, poets,<br />\nor dramatists than William Bader Yeats, lames Joyce, George Bernard<br />\nShaw, Samuel Beckettt, Oscar Wilde or Brendan Behan. In fact, one is<br />\nrather hardpressed to think of an English-born\u2022 writer of the period of<br />\neqiuil status.<br />\nHere in America, though, the average Irilbinan is characterized as a<br />\nil, and eager to kill people<br />\n'<br />\nheavy drinking Catholic, who is poor, boastril<br />\nover some stupid religious difference. Because it is common to read how<br />\nmany people have been killed in the last three years of sectarian strife in<br />\nNorthern Ireland it is easy to be oblivious of the fact that more people<br />\nhave been killed in civil disturbances in Jamaica than Northern Ireland<br />\nduring the same period of time, and that the Christian vs. Moslem war in<br />\nLebanon has claimed more lives in a year than violence in Northern<br />\nIreland has in the last five. Nor do most people realize that the society in<br />\nNorthern Ireland is structured against Catholics as solidly as Mississippi<br />\nwas structured against blacks in the fifties.<br />\nRather than think of the Irish as drunkards, blowing up whatever they<br />\ncan, think of them as a people dispossessed of the homeland. Better still,think of them as the much abused, oft-forgotten cornerstone of modern<br />\nEurope. \u2022<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letter/march 18, 1977.<br /><br />\nCongresswoman Shirley Chisholm:<br />\nFull of outrage and sorrow<br /><br />\nBy MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nShirley Chisholm, the first black congresswoman in<br />\nAmerica, represents a New York district which includes<br />\nBedford-Stuyesant, one of the nation's largest ghettoes.<br />\nThe 52-year-old Chisholm became a national political<br />\nfigure in 1972 when she made a presidential bid and<br />\nreceived 152 delegate votes. Speaking March 9 at the<br />\nCollege of Notre Dame on the topic \"Women and Work in<br />\nAmerica: Then and Now,\" Mrs. Chisholm displayed an<br />\nintense awareness of \"the unwillingness of our society to<br />\nallow women to share in the American dream.\"<br />\nThere is a pattern to American history, contended<br />\nChisholm, which explains how we 'arrived at a<br />\ndiscriminatory system of laws. Early colonial laws were<br />\nbased on English common law, in which women were<br />\nproperty, and early American legal documents were much<br />\nthe same: \"The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were<br />\nwritten by and for men.- In American history books<br />\nthere is little mention of women, those who played<br />\ncrucial roles in the growth of the West and of cities.<br />\nChisholm traced the ways in which discriminatory work<br />\npractices, like many American history books, have made<br />\nsecond class citizens of women: \"Since work is a source<br /><br />\nof fulfillment and success, discrimination on the basis of<br />\nsex deprives women of one basic way to success.- Women<br />\nwere discouraged from working, were encouraged to stay<br />\nhome: Indeed, a woman interested in physical labor was a<br />\nsocial outcast.<br />\n\"Women had entered into the labor force at times<br />\nwhen the economy demanded it. [In World War Two]<br />\nwomen were welcomed into the factories and assembly<br />\nlines to produce nitions for war.\" But, when the war was<br />\nover, after women had proven their capacities, they were<br />\nsummarily pushed aside. It was no longer acceptable for<br />\nwomen to work, and many who wanted to work were<br />\nconsidered unpatriotic, because they deprived returning<br />\nsoldiers of jobs. \"That pattern has been reinforced in<br />\nevery aspect of our society.\"<br />\nChisholm compared the feminist movement of today<br />\nwith the Civil Rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's,<br />\nwhen large numbers of women, black and white,<br />\ndemanded equal rights for blacks. \"Out of this struggle we<br />\nput laws on the books. In doing so the federal government<br />\nhelped to end discrimination by race...Many women who<br />\nhad marched in Selma began to realize that discrimination<br />\non the basis of sex was just as dehumanizing, just as<br />\ndemoralizing, as discrimination on the basis of the color<br /><br />\nAn open<br />\nktter to<br />\nMartin<br />\nMandel<br /><br />\nDar Marvin:<br />\nWhen St. Patrick expelled tile snakes from Ireland, a<br />\nfew good swimmers in the lot widoubtedly made their.<br />\n.way to Maryland.

An unusually large turnout for<br />\nthe voting\u2014almost one-half the student body\u2014was<br />\nvariously attributed to the warm weather, the concern<br />\nover administration maneuverings, and the mistaking of<br />\nballot boxes for kleenex dispensers.<br />\nIn the Presidential race, a five-person struggle was pared<br />\nto a two-man runoff.

The latter, however, faces almost<br />\na two-hundred vote deficit to be made up in the finals<br />\n(trailing Davidson in the preliminaries, 382 to 193).<br />\nLeft in the canipaign lurch were Brad Stark, Gary<br />\nStahl, and Bunny Howard. The two remaining candidates<br />\nmay have to barter for their important blocs of votes to<br />\ngain the top spot, as primary losers can often spell trouble<br />\nfor the victors (cf. Ronald Reagan, How to Leave Your<br />\nOPponent Thirty Points Down on Some Godforsaken Ski<br />\nSlope).<br />\nThe Vice-Presidential contest came down to the wire,<br />\nas Randy Randazzo edged out the other half of the<br />\nChesanow ticket, Andy Albstein, 401-380.

We've<br />\ncooperated with the FBI, we've kept from publicly<br />\ncriticizing the FBI, but we're not further along in the<br />\ninvestigation now than we were six months ago.\"-Michael<br />\nMoffitt<br />\nMichael Moffitt is an angry young man and there's a<br />\ngood reason why. It's been over six months now since<br />\nMoffitt's wife Ronni and former Chilean ambassador<br />\nOrlando Letelier were assassinated on Washington's<br />\nEmbassy Row. Over six months and still the FBI has<br />\nfailed to capture their killers.<br />\nAnd it's not as if the FBI is short on leads. In fact,<br />\nMoffitt and his co-workers at the Institute for Policy<br />\nStudies [IPS] have provided investigators with the names<br />\nand addresses of the men they say planted the bomb in<br />\nLetelier's car last September.<br />\n\"We have evidence that the assassination was ordered<br />\nby DINA [Chile's secret police] and carried out by six<br />\nCuban ex`iles, all veteran terrorists, who are now living in<br />\nFlorida,\" claims Moffitt. The FBI has been given this<br />\ninformation but refuses to act on it, looking instead for<br />\nnon-political motives for the killings. The most frustrating<br />\npart, says Moffitt, is that the FBI knows that IPS is right<br />\nbut still won't do anything.<br />\nA possible key link in the case is Orlando Bosch, a<br />\nterrorist with DINA affiliations, who is now in jail in<br />\nVenezuela. Moffitt believes that Bosch could let go with<br />\nsome valuable talk if only the FBI would make the effort.<br />\n\"We've been told time and time again that they're<br />\nready to move on the case, and now they say they're<br />\nstymied. Does someone else have to get their head blown<br />\noff to show the FBI that DINA isn't kidding around?\"<br />\nMoffitt commented. Failing immediate action from the<br />\nFBI, IPS may call for a special congressional investigation<br />\ninto the murders, although considering Congress' track<br />\nrecord on that score, not many are optimistic about the<br />\nresults of such an investigation.<br />\n\"This assassination is a direct outgrowth of U.S. foreign<br /><br />\npolicy since World War II. The CIA has been trying to<br />\ndestroy progressive movements in Third World countries<br />\ncommitted to social change for years now,\" Moffitt said.<br />\nThe people of Chile join those of Iran, Brazil, Vietnam<br />\nand a host of other countries who have been savagely<br />\nvictimized by American imperialism since World War II.<br />\nIt's no secret that a public airing of this murder probe<br />\nwould do little to bolster the flagging image of the CIA<br />\nmainly because of its close ties with DINA and other<br />\nforeign secret police netwprds. Exactly what the Cia role<br />\nin the Letelier assassination is remains unclear, but<br />\naccording to Moffitt, \"It's inconceivable that foreign<br />\npolice are carrying out illegal activities in the United<br />\nStates without the CIA knowing about them.\" It's also no<br />\nsecret that the Cuban gunmen were CIA-trained. So, it's<br />\nnot hard to figure out why the FBI is dragging its feet on<br />\nthe investigation.<br />\nAnd there's no indication that this terrorism will stop.<br />\n\"A person I know is said to be on DINA's hit list, he's<br />\nbeen harrassed and followed, but we still can't get police<br />\nprotection for him or any other Chilean,\" stated Moffitt.<br />\nRelations between the United States and Chile are<br />\nbound to be less friendly during Jimmy Carter's<br />\nadministration, but whether the Chilean Junta is given a<br />\nwrist-slapping or is dealt with morel severely remains to be<br />\nseen. Moffitt's unsure about Carter's position , saying<br />\n\"It's another case of him promising something during the<br />\ncampaign and not knowing whether he'll act on it.\"<br />\nMoffitt added that the Chilean government was<br />\ndisappointed when Carter nosed out Ford last November<br />\nbecause they think he's \"too dangerous\" and \"too far to<br />\nthe left.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, DINA agents are busier than ever, stalking<br />\naround Washington,. checking out campuses, tracking<br />\ndown and harrassing: Chileans disloyal to the Junta.

I realize, too, that<br />\nmany people are of the attitude<br />\nthat the world is a sad place if<br />\nothers cannot bear a few laughing<br />\nslights against them, e.g. the<br />\nPolish, Italian, etc.,joke.<br />\nHowever, I am confused as to<br />\nthe purpose of Mr. Colin Camerer<br />\nin his \"article\" of 3-8-77. Is he<br />\nwriting news, social commentary,<br />\nor satire? I do not find it<br />\nnewsworthy, legitimate, or<br />\nlaughable. I find it appalling and<br />\npitiful in its backward prejudice<br />\nand false sense of superiority. Mr.<br />\nCamerer, in his piece on the<br />\nEvening College, has found it<br />\nnecessary to include derogatory<br />\ndescriptions of Jews, nurses, and<br />\nhousewives, and to downgrade<br />\nand patronize a segment of the'<br />\nuniversity that truly deserves<br />\nplaudits, not put-downs.<br />\nA great many people have<br />\nconsiderable respect for those<br />\nworking adults who have the<br />\ncourage and motivation to return<br />\nto school at the expense of their<br />\nfree time. These students are<br />\nsincere, intelligent, and eager to<br />\nbe accepted, yet they are often<br />\nhampered by the attitudes of<br />\ncertain undergraduates such as<br />\nMr. Camerer, who seems to view<br />\nthem as ridiculous. Mr. Camerer<br />\nhas examined his subjects<br />\nthrough stereotypic. rather than<br /><br />\nrose-colored, glasses.<br />\nStereotyping is passe, Mr.<br />\nCamerer. It is not entertaining.<br />\nI question Mr. Camerer's taste<br />\nin wishing to have such an article<br />\npublished, and 1 question the<br />\ntaste of the News-Letter in<br />\nchoosing to publish it.

Fortunately for<br />\nthem, many Baltimoreans wee still suffering the effects<br />\nof the Civil War and the Depression of 1873. TheY<br />\nwelcomed both Peabody and Hopkins students into their<br />\nhomes as boarders.<br />\nSo many students settled near McCulloh and Biddle<br />\nStreets that this area was christened the Latin Quarter. It<br />\nwas quiet with old brick houses later praised by Hopkins<br />\nalumnus Woodrow Wilson in a letter to his sweetheart.<br />\nIf Johns Hopkins is world-famous today,it certainly<br />\nwasn't known by all Baltimoreans in the 1880's. Indeed.<br />\nnot until the Hospital began treating patients did<br />\n\"Hopkins\" become a household word. A Johns Hopkins<br />\nstudent, placing an ad in the Baltimore Sun for a room<br />\n\"near the University\", was offered a room near the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland medical school.<br />\nLiving was pretty cheap. Rooms were usually $5 a<br />\nmonth. Meals went for $4 a week, or that much a<br />\nfortnight if you cooked them yourself. Milk was 3 cents a<br />\nglass, apples, two for a nickel. Twelve bananas could be<br />\nhad for 8 cents at the Lexington Market. And kerosene to<br />\nfuel your study lamp was a quarter a month.<br />\nHerbert Baxter Adams (of Adams House fame) claimed<br />\nthat cutting corners in Germany, it still cost him $1000 a<br />\nyear.

Professor Morris would invite<br />\n'Iudents to his home for \"oysters, beer, and cigars.\" Such<br />\nrilenngs even took place in the library, that is, until the<br />\ni<br />\nfatian<br />\ndiscovered a piece of chicken pressed between<br />\nPages of a very valuable book.<br />\ni Students often made house calls to their professors, the<br />\nfr4,stees, and their families. They visited the families of<br />\nYoung women en masse, as dating was still a<br />\nflsclalous endeavor. Clubs such as the Twenty Questions<br />\nfill') were organized by the inure creative Baltimore belles<br />\n\u00b0r the sole purpose of partying with Hopkins students.<br />\n110Pkins' first fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, was organized<br />\n1)(ktlY one century ago. The first pledge class journeyed<br />\nt\u00b0h Yale where they were initiated at President Gilman's<br />\nPter of the fraternity. Later, more fraternities came<br />\nexistence. Frat houses were more social than<br />\nential: only a few graduate students lived there, to<br />\nheelP pay the rent and thus maintain a fraternity<br />\nad quarters. Frat-community relations were a problem<br />\nthen, and landlords often evicted fraternities from<br />\ne_tr tow houses.<br />\nFrat athletics and hazing were unheard of until the late<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\n1890's. But other activities, especially rushing, got out of<br />\nhand when brothers sought pledges from the nearby boys<br />\nprep schools.<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa was Hopkins' only honorary fraternity<br />\nat the turn of the century. President Gilman was<br />\nappointed its first chairman. Admission into Phi Beta<br />\nKappa required a unanimous vote, a rule which, due to a<br />\ncertain woman-hater alumnus, kept several .co-cd: from<br />\nmembership.<br />\nSince there was no gymnasium, itchy students turned<br />\nto recreational facilities in the city. The Baltimore<br />\nAthletic Club promised to waive the initiation fee of any<br />\nstudent provided he pay the one dollar monthly dues. The<br />\nUniversity chartered a horse-drawn wagon which brought<br />\nboys to clifton, the estate of Mr. Johns Hopkins, where<br />\nthey could play on the open lawns.<br />\nIn 1882 Edward Hartwell was appointed the Hopkins'<br />\nfirst physical education instructor. A year later a small<br />\ngym equipped with lockers, bath, and offices was<br />\nconstructed. Tennis courts were laid in the yard area. A<br />\nfootball team was organized in 1881, lacrosse in 1882. As<br />\nsports grew at Hopkins, it was obvious the present<br />\ngymnasium was inadequate. In 1898 row houses were<br />\ndemolished, and a new,larger gym was erected.<br />\nIn 1876 a club, modeled after the German kneipe, or<br />\ntavern, was organized for Saturday night get-togethers. The<br />\nstudents played cards, chess, smoked (cigarettes), drank<br />\nbeer, and sang German and Latin songs led by the<br />\nclassicist Basil Gildersleeve. Later the group established a<br />\nregular meeting hall in the back room of a grocery store.<br />\nSaint Dennis, a black man, tended the fire and<br />\noccasionally crossed the street to buy refreshments for the<br />\nstudents. In ten years the kneipe gave way to a more<br />\norganized Johns Hopkins University Club with Professor<br />\nGildersleeve presiding. Unfortunately undergraduates<br />\nwere screwed again as membership was limited to those<br />\ntwenty-five and over. Thus, many students had to seek<br />\nthrills elsewhere.<br />\nThe first society formed solely in the interests of the<br />\nundergraduates was the Matriculate Society. Their<br />\nopening dance--or \"hop\", as it was appropriately<br />\ncalled \u2014was held on Commemoration Day, 1887, in the<br />\ngymnasium. Due to its success, the hops were held on<br />\nother occasions. Despite the fact that Goucher College<br />\nallowed only girls living with their parents to attend the<br />\nhops, there were usually enough \"locals\" on hand to<br />\ndance with.<br /><br />\nOld Administration building<br />\nThe theatre was almost untouched by Hopkins<br />\nstudents before the turn of the century. .The only<br />\ndramatic production on record is a minstral show by the<br />\nlight-hearted local fraternity, Alpha Sigma Sigma (ASS)<br />\nin 1890. The two hundred dollar profit from ticket sales<br />\nwas donated to the Athletic Association.<br />\nThe first Glee Club was formed in 1879 and enjoyed a<br />\nvery short life. In 1883 another Glee Club was organized,<br />\nwith tenor Woodrow Wilson among its first members. But<br />\na banjo and mandolin club formed five years later was so<br />\n'popular that it knocked the Glee Club out of prominence.<br />\nSoon this new music club, equipped with singers,<br />\nperformed concerts in Maryland and other states. Several<br />\nstudents, perhaps realizing their true talents, never<br />\nreturned to the University. This, along with a faculty fed<br />\nup with banjo practice in the classrooms, caused music to<br />\nabruptly stop at Hopkins. Is wasn't until almost the end<br />\nof the century that a new music group, incorporating glee,<br />\nbanjo, and mandolin, was organized.<br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory of Music always attracted<br />\nHopkins students. They were known even to cut class(or<br />\nseminars, as they were called) to see a performance. The<br />\ntheatre too, offered top-quality entertainment: Booth,/<br />\nJefferson, Rossi.<br />\nIn 1897 a music appreciation club was formed.<br />\nConcerts were performed in the original McCoy Hall<br />\ndowntown, under the direction of the Peabody<br />\nConservatory of Music. In a few years interest in this<br />\nmusic association waned.<br /><br />\n70's terrorism comes to the United States<br />\nViolence is as American as<br />\napple pie.\"<br />\n\u2014H.

Well, the JFX does not look<br />\ntoo promising, but don't give up on that general direction. There happens to be a place named Long John's<br />\nPub that sits on the tail end of West 29th, across from Sterling's, yet.<br />\nLong John's is as good a spot as any to drown out the sorrows of shut-down Maryland race tracks. In<br />\nfact, this bar rates a cut above the average Greenmount or Hampden saloon, at least in terms of decor.<br />\nTables with non-plastic green tablecloths. Candles that have fishnet patterns around their glass containers.<br />\nSwivel-action leather bar stools and a deluxe giant TV screen.<br />\nPlushness, however, is a double-edged sword in drinking establishments. The ritzy style at Long<br />\nJohn's\u2014as one patron conjectured. \"the owners must just be little homebodies\"\u2014tends to preclude a sense<br />\nof locale, of Baltimore turf. The bar could be uprooted and transplanted anywhere along the Eastern<br />\nseaboard without the blink of an eyelash. During football season, Colt highlight films and Monday night<br />\ngames aroused loyalty; nowadays, a bare Oriole poster hangs on the wall to remind one of the city.<br />\nThe \"notch-above\" atmosphere fortunately does not bring along higher prices. Tuborg Gold goes for<br />\nforty cents a draft, a very modest expense. And Happy Hour from five to six (Monday through Thursday)<br />\nfeatures a nickel off the beer and mixed drinks for forty cents. To get food, show up sometime in the<br />\nafternoon for standard grill fare; at night, pizzas are served until 11:30. Those who complain of an absence<br />\nof Nathan's in the area should check out the Monday night special: hot dogs for a quarter apiece.<br />\nThe physical proportions inside Long John's also set it apart from the neighborhood taverns. A very long<br />\nbar cuts a large \"L\" in the room, leaving relatively small space for tables. Most of the patrons, then, sit at<br />\nthe bar, which doesn't make for the crowds about the tables usually seen at other places. Instead, this is one<br />\nplace the reviewer can trot out that favored word\u2014\"intimacy.\"<br />\nFor some action, the jukebox suffers from an overdose of country tunes, though a Buddy Holly number<br />\nof \"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling\" may be found. A couple \"new\" pinball machines (one is Captain<br />\nFantastic) stand along one wall, a rarity in these parts\u2014most bars carry the old-style machines that lack<br />\nflipper, points, and any apparent redeeming social value. The real game connoiseur will be delighted to find<br />\na miniature electronic bowling alley, where one slides a metal disc to knock down the pins. Several different<br />\ngames can be played, all for a long-lasting quarter for two contestants. And anyone who scores over 199 on<br />\nthe \"Regular\" version may receive a welcome surprise one Friday (ask the bartender for details).<br />\nLong John's will probably seem unfamiliar to the seasoned local barg..,er, what with its higher-class<br />\ninterior and close surroundings. Like any good bar, however, a few rounds and words with the regulars will<br />\nmake one feel right at home in Charm City.<br />\n2<br />\n--Sizuff'y Sandlot<br /><br />\nDiNiNq IN BALTIMORE -- NATURAL<br />\nScirocco Restaurant, 3900 N. Charles<br />\nSt., is the most recent addition to thE<br />\nlimited list of natural food restaurants in<br />\nBaltimore. Unfortunate1y, it is not the<br />\nwonder it is advertised to be.<br />\nTo begin with, Scirrocco has an<br />\nidentity problem. Benevolent murals of<br />\nsmiling suns and friendly cacti are<br />\njuxtaposed with a well-stocked bar, over<br />\nwhich sits a plastic sign bearing the<br />\nrestaurant name. Waiters cheerfully<br />\nattired in Scirrocco T-shirts work with a<br />\nmaitre d' in a black three-piece suit, a<br />\nman who belongs more with the<br />\nfasionable establishment on the other side<br />\nof the partition.<br />\nThis peculiar split personality is also<br />\nreflected in the table settings and menu.<br />\nThe blue -checkered tablecloths are<br />\nprotected by a sheet of acrylic on which a<br />\ndirty little vase holds a few dried flowers.<br />\nThe course offerings vary from the<br />\ntraditional roast prime ribs of beef to'the<br />\nmore \"exotic\" and \"original\"<br />\nall-vegetable dishes.<br />\nDinner began with soup served in a<br />\ncup, a feature not mentioned on the<br />\nmenu. The fresh mushroom soup was<br />\nneither tasty nor fresh, and seemed<br />\nreheated. For one-fourth the price, a can<br />\nof Campbell's would have been more<br />\nplentiful and appetizing.<br />\nOur appetizers, mushroom caps stuffed<br />\nwith snails in garlic butter, were an<br />\nextreme disappointment. The few<br />\nmushroom slices floating in the soup<br />\ncame from larger mushrooms than those<br />\nused for appetizer. The taste of garlic<br />\nbutter was barely perceptible, and the<br />\ndecorative parsley limp beyond<br />\nrecognition.<br />\nOur main courses consisted of small<br />\nPortions of a curried vegetable dish<br />\nWithout curry (bearing a strange<br />\nresemblance to another dish on the<br />\nmenu), and a Ratatouille casserole. The<br />\nvegetables were generally unrecognizable<br />\nby taste or appearance, due to<br />\novercooking or continuous re-warming.<br />\nWhen the Ratatouille, which was cold on<br />\nthe inside, was returned, it came back<br />\nalmost immediately piping-hot, the plate<br /><br />\nPub<br /><br />\nstill manageable. This suggested the use of<br />\na micro-wave oven. Is this the \"natural<br />\ntaste of food\" that Scirrocco's boasts?<br />\nThe gastronomical highlight of the<br />\nevening was the bread, two honey-carrot<br />\nmuffins fresh from the oven, served at the<br />\nend of the meal.<br />\nThe establishment claims that \"every<br />\nmeal is prepared to your order.\" Is this<br />\nthe only excuse for slow service and<br />\ntemperamental cooks? There are no<br />\nchoices offered within any dish, and it<br />\nturned out to be difficult to distinguish<br />\none vegetarian item from another. The.<br />\nmenu differentiated by sauce, but the<br />\nchef didn't seem to go that far.<br />\nScirrocco is more expensive .and<br />\npretentious, and less imaginative than the<br />\nother natural food restaurants in the area.<br />\nThey are attempting to integrate healthy<br />\neating with middle-class standards: They<br />\nhave not succeeded\u2014they have only<br />\nmanaged to bring out the worst aspects of<br />\nboth realms.<br />\nPerhaps they should not have tried.<br />\n-- The Bobsey Twins<br /><br />\nSaturday past, several consorts and<br />\ntook a stroll down Little Italy way,<br />\nthought we'd eat well, drink well, and be<br />\nItalian for at least a night.

The visitors<br />\nfrom New York state are defending National champions.<br />\nin Division II and, according to Homewood coach<br />\nHenry<br />\nCiccarone, \"play a gambling style of lacrosse that<br />\n(Hopkins) probably won't see too much of during the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nThe Jays had played sluggishly during the first quarter<br />\nof their previous two scrimmages, but such was not the<br />\ncase on Wednesday afternoon. Hopkins opened with a<br />\ntremendous rush and it looked as though Hobart would<br />\n'be run right off th6 field and clear across University<br />\nParkway.<br />\nJHU opened the scoring early in the opening period,<br />\nculminating a series of passes in which over half the team<br />\nmembers on the field had possession of the ball. After<br />\nmaking a save, goalie Kevin Mahon passed out to<br />\ndefenseman Mark Greenberg. Defenseman Leroy Katz,<br />\nattackman Mike O'Neill and midfielder Tom Myrick also<br />\nhad the ball before Doober Auburn fired home the game's<br />\nOpening goal.<br />\nOn the ensuing face-off, middie Bob Maimone got the<br />\nball to Dave Huntley. Huntley returned it to Maimone<br />\nand Bob put a 15-foot bullet past the helpless goalie.<br />\nMaimone notched his second goal of the contest minutes<br />\nlater and JHU held a 3-0 lead before Hobart knew what<br />\nhad hit them.<br />\nHowever, the visitors came storming back with three<br />\ngoals of their own to knot the score midway through t!<br /><br />\nquarter. This tie was shortlived as Huntley, Hirsch and<br />\nBob DeSimone scored for Hopkins before the period had<br />\nended and the Jays held a 6-3 lead after the game's first<br />\nfifteen minutes.<br />\nThe second quarter was marked by a definite letdown<br />\nin the pace of play, as compared with that in the first<br />\nperiod. Neither team played consistently well for any<br />\nlength of time and there was little sustained offense at<br />\neither end of the field. Both squads tallied a pair of goals<br />\napiece (DeSimone and Jon Swerdloff for JHU) giving<br />\nHopkins an 8-5 halftime bulge.<br />\nAs contrasted with their performance in the second<br />\nperiod, the Blue Jays' effort in the third quarter was<br />\nexcellent. The offense regained some of the life and style<br />\nit had exhibited in the opening quarter, while the defense,<br />\nsave for one mental lapse, totally shut down the Hobart<br />\nscoring machinery.<br />\nThe Jays outscored fheir visitors 4-1 in this third<br />\nfifteen minutes of action to take a commanding 12-6 lead<br />\ninto the fourth quarter. Swerdloff, a freshman from<br />\nBaltimore, paced the attack with a pair of goals.<br />\nThe game was no longer in doubt during the final<br />\nperiod, a situation that gave both coaches a chance to rest<br />\ntheir starters. Play became sloppy once again, although<br />\nthe scoring did not cease. The Jays added four goals to<br />\ntheir total, with Swerdloff having a goal and an assist to<br />\nbring his point total to five for his'afternoon's work.<br />\nCiccarone was not particularly happy with the team's<br />\noverall play, but did see aspects of the game that he hopes<br />\nto see continue.<br />\n\"I was pleased with the way we capitalized on some of<br />\ntheir defensive mistakes,\" the Coach noted. \"In addition,<br />\nour defense did a good job\u2014we gave them a few goals and<br />\nthen we shut the door.\"<br />\nConcerning Saturday's opponent, Yale, the third year<br /><br />\nmentor said, \"I don't know anything about them and that<br />\ncould be dangerous. But, if we play the way we're capable<br />\nof playing, we should beat them.\"<br />\n\u2022 The Bulldogs from New Haven are 1-1 on the season so<br />\nfar having beaten North Carolina State and lost to Duie.<br />\nGametime on Homewood field is 2:00.<br /><br />\nIn the springtime one's fancy<br />\nTurns to love and baseball<br /><br />\nLegged<br /><br />\nweapons of<br /><br />\nWhile springtime may shift many Hopkins' minds Baltimore, and<br />\noutfielder George Coutros of nearby<br />\ntoward the spring fair, lacrosse, or, in general, the winding Cockeysville.<br />\ndown of the school year, for some, the warmer weather<br />\nThe set of returning vets include co-captains Bob Babb<br />\nsignifies the retuyn of baseball to the Homewood of Bloomsburg,<br />\nPennsylvania and David Emala of<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nRandallstown, Maryland, plus the team's number one<br />\nAnd because the Blue Jay nine are coming off their hurler of a year<br />\nago, Charlie Lachenbruch of Los Altos<br />\nbest season ever and are entering the season with a core of Hills, California.
