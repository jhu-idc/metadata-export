Surely most other campus<br />\norganizations\u2014including Student Council<br />\nand partisan political groups\u2014have been<br />\nless energetic or caring in securing<br />\nstudent reforms. Our mistake has been<br />\ngrumbling inwardly but never protesting<br />\nloudly the treatment afforded us by this<br />\nnewspaper, the communications channel<br />\nfor Hopkins students badly-dispersed.<br />\nLast fall, News-Letter published a<br />\nletter from \"anonymous\" decrying the<br />\nlack of female solidarity on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. A quick perusal of that printed<br />\nmessage gave the impression that<br />\nAnonymous was a bit neurotic and prone<br />\nto creating incoherent images. What<br />\nNews-Letter failed to mention, however,<br />\nwas that in its attempts to convert an<br />\nintended feature article into a sensational<br />\n1\u2022Akk%<br />\nVacm>exe.A. ,<br />\n<br />\nstudies is not inactive.

Nor is fighting for an infirmary '<br />\nthat cares for women's problems<br />\n(including the need for a gynecologist).<br />\nOur \"inactivity\" has also gained a<br />\nwomen's center, cooperation by the<br />\nlibrary to obtain feminist literature, a<br />\nrevision of gymnasium rules, and an<br />\nactive consciousness-raising group open<br />\nto all Hopkins students.<br />\nLaughing at Agnew<br />\nThese are the things we have<br />\naccomplished.

Women's Liberation at Hopkins<br />\nis surviving during deplorable months. At<br />\na time, too, when students are providing<br />\nglee for the the government, News-Letter<br />\nshould withhold its flippancies and give<br />\nmore honest coverage to a group after<br />\nreform.

Most<br />\nwho have criticized the program have noted that it<br />\ndoes not go far enough instead of complaining of its<br />\ninnovative qualities. As one junior professor remarked<br />\nlast week, \"The only difference from the present<br />\nsystem is that the new proposals are unworkable.\"<br />\nThough the Academic Council did display imagination<br />\nin coming forth with its \"independent Study<br />\nContract\" suggestion, a program that would clearly<br />\nimprove some areas of undergraduate education, it is<br />\nnot the cure-all for all ills.<br />\nAs has been indicated before, the major problem in<br />\nthis area is what to do with the student who is not<br />\ncertain of his academic or career direction. These<br />\nindividuals are now usually wandering amidst what can<br />\neasily become the academic wasteland of the area<br />\nmajors. It is clear that if the Council is going to deal<br />\nwith the problems in undergraduate education, it must<br />\ndeal with the area major. Somehow, students must be<br />\nallowed the flexibility such a major offers while being<br />\nintegrated into the academic life that a departmental<br />\nmajor offers. Perhaps the answer is the option of<br />\nstructured interdepartmental studies; or perhaps a<br />\ncommittee is needed to act as a department for the<br />\narea majors. In any case, it is necessary that the<br />\nAcademic Council consider the problems of the<br />\nstudent seeking a liberal arts education.<br />\n<br />\n4J<br />\n.6<br />\nbk-c<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n\"You Took The Words<br />\nRight Out Of My Mouth\"<br />\n<br />\n'NELPfgEgimil<br />\n<br />\n/Aj<br />\n<br />\n0426<br />\n<br />\n2--\u2022<br />\n/<br />\n\u2022I<br />\n<br />\ncriden.k<br />\n<br />\n1111<br />\n<br />\nriscut<br />\n<br />\n7f' U-7 77\"<br />\n<br />\nThe old songs, the old songs, those good old songs for me<br />\nBy HOWARD WEAVER<br />\n<br />\nrightinto the Towsonaires organization, a<br />\nfull-fledged chapter of the International<br />\nSociety for the Preservation and<br />\nEncouragement of Barbershop Quartet<br />\nSinging in America.

They have<br />\nbeen denied the all-important credential,<br />\nthe degree.

Most people expected<br />\nLoyola to have little trouble with the<br />\nscrappy young Hopkins team, but<br />\nsomeone forgot to tell Rupert's boys,<br />\nwho were out to extend their three game<br />\nwinning streak.<br />\nQuickly overcoming a slow start, the<br />\nBlue Jays grabbed the lead early in the<br />\ngame as center Bill Jews dominated the<br />\ndefensive boards. Hopkins staved off a<br />\nGreyhound surge that saw Loyola take a<br />\nshort-lived 29-28 lead, when the Blue<br />\nJays, led by sophomore guards Bobby<br />\nFreedman and John Rutter, charged right<br />\nback to carry a 37-32 advantage into the<br />\nlocker room at halftime.<br />\nHaving shot a remarkable 67% from<br />\nthe floor, hitting on 14 of 21 shots in the<br />\nfirst half, the Blue Jays were ready to go<br />\nall out in the second half. They widened<br />\nthe gap to ten points as Rupert's varying<br />\nzone defense had the Greyhounds<br />\nstymied. The game could easily have<br />\nturned into a runaway at this point, were<br />\n<br />\nit not for nine key turnovers that kept<br />\nHopkins from putting points on the<br />\nscoreboard. According to Coach Rupert,<br />\n\"turnovers have been bugging us all year,<br />\nbut we are handling the ball much better<br />\nnow than we were earlier in the season.\"<br />\nWith thirteen minutes left to play,<br />\nLoyola finally settled down and began to<br />\nmake their shots count. Sparked by the<br />\nalert play of Gene Gwiazdowski and the<br />\nsuddenly unerring shooting of Ed Butler,<br />\nwho scored 16 of his game high 21 points<br />\nin the second half comeback, Loyola<br />\ntook command of the game. Outscoring<br />\nthe Blue Jays 17-5 over a five minute<br />\nperiod, the Greyhounds picked up the<br />\nmomentum that carried them to eventual<br />\nvictory.

In retrospect, the team<br />\ncould have been 17-0 with a little<br />\nluck.<br />\nBut the most important<br />\nsegment of the season, the<br />\nMiddle North Atlantic<br />\nChampionships, is yet to come.<br />\nThe fencers have high hopes and<br />\ngood chances of widening these<br />\ncrowns. The top two men in each<br />\nweapon are seriously training for<br />\nthese two big days.<br />\nIn sabre, co-captain Keith<br />\nBucklen has an excellent chance<br />\nof winning the individual MAC<br />\nsabre title. Freshman Bruce<br />\nLivingston, who has successfully<br />\nmade the transition from foil to<br />\nsabre, will fence in the number<br />\ntwo spot.<br />\nJunior epeeist Gary Green has<br />\na shot at taking first place in his<br />\n<br />\nweapon. He will receive strong<br />\nsupport from co-captain Ingram<br />\nRoberts, who has made a fine<br />\nshowing the past two weeks.<br />\nTurning to foil, we find in the<br />\nfirst position all-MAC senior<br />\nJeffrey Rosenbaum, who will be<br />\nback in top form after suffering<br />\nfrom a pinched nerve in<br />\nmid -season. Freshman Glenn<br />\nPantel will provide a very strong<br />\nnumber two punch, since he's<br />\nhad a very successful season<br />\nwhile working to smooth out his<br />\ntechnique.<br />\nWith these top six men, the<br />\nBlue Jays should have no<br />\nproblem with Haverford College<br />\nthis Saturday at 2:30 pm in the<br />\nHomewood gym. Examining<br />\nthe jv, we find several men with<br />\nexcellent potential. Top<br />\nperformers thus far have been as<br />\nfollows: Sabremen Ed Casey and<br />\nJohn Roberts, eqeeists Dean Gain<br />\nand David Loeb, and foilmen Al<br />\nFriend and Nathan Centers, all of<br />\nwhom had not fenced prior to<br />\nthis season. In their prospective<br />\nweapons, Friend, Gain, and<br />\nCasey took first place in the<br />\nAFLA beginners class<br />\ntournament. Their last meet will<br />\nbe this Saturday against the<br />\nHaverford J.V.<br />\n<br />\nChampion diver Ken Zonies is caught in mid-air during one of his<br />\ngraceful dives.

He also cited the need<br />\nfor more law schools in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nAccording to Eisenhower, the<br />\ninitial cost would be $10 million,<br />\nincluding an estimated $2 million<br />\nfor a law library and $2.5 million<br />\nfor additional buildings.<br />\nNew Funds<br />\nHe said that completely new<br />\nfunds could be used to form the<br />\nschool, with most of the money<br />\ncoming from gifts and donations.<br />\nEisenhower added that the<br />\ninstitution could become a<br />\nfinancial asset, noting that<br />\npyestigious law schools at Harvard<br />\nand Yale obtain a tremendous<br />\namount of money from past<br />\ngraduates.<br />\nEisenhower observed that a<br />\nlaw school would broaden the<br />\nimage of Hopkins. \"By addition<br />\nof a law school, the entire public<br />\nunderstanding of this institution<br />\nwould change,\" he commented.<br />\nA law school, he contended,<br />\nCoke is the Real Thing<br />\nSo is a Harley Sandwich<br />\nStop By and Find<br />\nOut Why?<br />\n3111 St. Paul St.<br />\nOPEN LATE<br />\nPAT'S<br /><br />\nVARIETY<br />\nTHRIFT SHOP<br /><br />\nNew &amp; Used Merchandise<br />\nAt Bargain Prices<br />\nBought &amp; Sold<br />\n, 3038 Greenmount 243-1308<br />\np.<br /><br />\nMENU<br />\nSUBS<br />\nPIZZA<br />\nCHICKEN<br />\nSPAGHETTI<br />\nYOU NAME IT<br /><br />\nThe Very Best<br /><br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\nCarry Out Shops<br />\n32nd near Greenmount<br />\n25th near Greenmount<br />\nServing you until<br />\nafter 2 a.m. every<br />\nnight.<br /><br />\nA professional<br />\nABORTION<br />\nthat is safe,<br />\nlegal &amp;<br />\ninexpensive<br />\ncan be set up on an<br />\noutpatient basis by calling<br />\nThe Problem Pregnancy<br />\nEducational Service, Inc.<br />\n215-722-S3GO<br />\n24 hours-7 draft<br />\nfor professional. oDnfidential<br />\nand wing helix<br /><br />\nwould show that Hopkins<br />\nencompassed a wide range of<br />\ninterests.<br />\nHe also said that building a law<br />\nschool should be a top-priority<br />\nitem in the fund-raising drive<br />\nslated to begin in July, 1973 as<br />\npart of the Hopkins Centennial<br />\ncelebration.<br />\nEisenhower remarked that a<br />\nHopkins law school could be<br />\nmore innovative than other<br />\ninstitutions. \"Extensive research<br />\ninto legal matter at the graduate<br />\nlevel would be of particular<br />\nimportance to a Hopkins law<br />\nschool,\" he said.<br />\nEisenhower has encountered<br />\nno formal opposition to his<br />\nproposed plan by the Board of<br />\nTrustees or faculty members.<br />\n\"This is a very personal thing<br />\nwith me,\" he added,\"and it may<br />\nnever happen, but I will continue<br />\nto try.\"<br /><br />\nstudents who could and should<br />\nbe involved in the contract<br />\nsystem. \"I doubt that 10 percent<br />\nof the students are capable of<br />\nbenefiting,\" said Dr. Roseman.<br />\n\"Most would not get a better<br />\neducation, which should be our<br />\nmain concern.\"<br />\nDr. Greene wondered how<br />\nmany students were interested in<br />\nparticipating in the independent<br />\ncontract program, and William<br />\nHuggins of Electrical Engineering<br />\nexpressed concern about the \u2022<br />\nstudents having their views heard<br />\non the proposals.<br /><br />\nSignificant response<br />\nPhillips was worried about<br />\nbeing able to obtain any<br />\nsignificant student response. \"If<br />\nwe sit on our fannies and wait for<br />\nstudents to come, we won't get<br />\nmuch.\" He said he felt the Blue<br />\nRibbon Panel was one good<br />\nsource of information.<br />\nOwen Phillips and Huggins<br /><br />\nProduction team note: The average American<br /><br />\nuses between five hundred sixty and five<br /><br />\nthought it was important to<br />\nstrengthen the ties between<br />\nstudents and departments.<br />\n\"Students should have a home<br />\nbase in a department instead of<br />\nhaving to float around as some<br />\narea majors do,\" said Dr,<br />\nHuggins.

Surely most other campus<br />\norganizations\u2014including Student Council<br />\nand partisan political groups\u2014have been<br />\nless energetic or caring in securing<br />\nstudent reforms. Our mistake has been<br />\ngrumbling inwardly but never protesting<br />\nloudly the treatment afforded us by this<br />\nnewspaper, the communications channel<br />\nfor Hopkins students badly-dispersed.<br />\nLast fall, News-Letter published a<br />\nletter from \"anonymous\" decrying the<br />\nlack of female solidarity on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. A quick perusal of that printed<br />\nmessage gave the impression that<br />\nAnonymous was a bit neurotic and prone<br />\nto creating incoherent images. What<br />\nNews-Letter failed to mention, however,<br />\nwas that in its attempts to convert an<br />\nintended feature article into a sensational<br />\n1\u2022Akk%<br />\nVacm&gt;exe.A. ,<br /><br />\nstudies is not inactive. Gaining the<br />\nenthusiasm and help of nine prominent<br />\nprofessors--and the pledges of two of<br />\nthem, Dr. Louise Young and Dr. Keith<br />\nMelder of the Smithsonion Institute, to<br />\nlecture on Women's History\u2014is not<br />\ninactive. Nor is fighting for an infirmary '<br />\nthat cares for women's problems<br />\n(including the need for a gynecologist).<br />\nOur \"inactivity\" has also gained a<br />\nwomen's center, cooperation by the<br />\nlibrary to obtain feminist literature, a<br />\nrevision of gymnasium rules, and an<br />\nactive consciousness-raising group open<br />\nto all Hopkins students.<br />\nLaughing at Agnew<br />\nThese are the things we have<br />\naccomplished. There are many other<br />\nthings we would like to do\u2014including the<br />\nconvincing of your reporter and every<br />\nother woman on campus to join us. Our<br />\ngroup, yes, would make greater strides at<br />\nanother time.

After the first meeting of<br />\nWo rrlen's Liberation in September,<br />\nNews;-Letter carried a short story about<br />\nthe formation of this new student reform<br />\ngrout). We flinched at the decision that<br />\nWornen's Liberation merited less space<br />\nthan a Macke sandwich machine; we<br />\nsondlered at the inanity of running with<br />\nthe airticle a photograph that had nothing<br />\nto d o with the subject; and we were<br />\nangrl that fie reporter had not even<br />\nbothered to report names, so that other<br />\nwomen could contact one or more of us.<br />\nNothing, however, even challenged the<br />\nbias that dictated that the article should<br />\nemphasise the fact that men were asked<br />\nthe leave the meeting. A new group was<br />\norganized- plans to change bits of<br />\ncampus philosophy were discussed -and<br />\nt he only real information that the<br />\nall-male editorship could find worthy was<br />\nthat men could not attend the first<br />\nmeeting! Sob...<br />\nYou carelessly label us inactive.. We<br />\nmust disagree.

If students, at Johns<br />\nHopkins and elsewhere, consider nothing<br />\nsacred enough to fight for anymore<br />\n(indeed, caring about anything more than<br />\na grade point average is scorned),<br />\nWomen's Liberation must feel some<br />\ncrippling effect.<br />\nOur group has not been inactive.<br />\nCollege Students as individuals have been<br />\ninactive. Women's Liberation at Hopkins<br />\nis surviving during deplorable months. At<br />\na time, too, when students are providing<br />\nglee for the the government, News-Letter<br />\nshould withhold its flippancies and give<br />\nmore honest coverage to a group after<br />\nreform.

Farber.<br /><br />\nFirst responses<br />\nIt<br /><br />\nis refreshing to note the faculty's mixed reaction<br />\nto the Academic Council's initial response to its charge<br />\nof studying undergraduate education had been mixed<br />\nin a manner favorable to the undergraduates.. Most<br />\nwho have criticized the program have noted that it<br />\ndoes not go far enough instead of complaining of its<br />\ninnovative qualities. As one junior professor remarked<br />\nlast week, \"The only difference from the present<br />\nsystem is that the new proposals are unworkable.\"<br />\nThough the Academic Council did display imagination<br />\nin coming forth with its \"independent Study<br />\nContract\" suggestion, a program that would clearly<br />\nimprove some areas of undergraduate education, it is<br />\nnot the cure-all for all ills.<br />\nAs has been indicated before, the major problem in<br />\nthis area is what to do with the student who is not<br />\ncertain of his academic or career direction. These<br />\nindividuals are now usually wandering amidst what can<br />\neasily become the academic wasteland of the area<br />\nmajors. It is clear that if the Council is going to deal<br />\nwith the problems in undergraduate education, it must<br />\ndeal with the area major. Somehow, students must be<br />\nallowed the flexibility such a major offers while being<br />\nintegrated into the academic life that a departmental<br />\nmajor offers.

They have such a<br />\ngood time that you want to join in, and<br />\nthe members (mostly middle-aged) went<br />\nout of their way to make six vaguely<br />\nfreaky-looking students feel welcome.<br />\nWe walked into one meeting, had a<br />\nguest book shoved in our hands, a<br />\npitch-pipe blown in our ears and a name<br />\ntag pinned on our shirts. \"Howdy, I'm<br /><br />\nThe Garden Room is a strange place to<br />\nfind a bunch of men singing barbershop<br />\nmusic.

But eliminating<br />\ntermpapers, which has been the reaction<br />\nof some professors to these charitable<br />\norganizations, seriously threatens to<br />\ndestroy the flow-through teabag known<br />\nas Hopkins.<br />\nThe revelations about firms like<br />\nTermpapers Unlimited, Inc. have shocked<br />\nthe city. One angry letter-writer to the<br />\nBaltimore Sun inquired, \"Call a college<br />\ndegree just be bought?\" Of course it can,<br />\nand the only difference between a<br />\nmail-order college and Hopkins is that we<br />\ndon't advertise on matchbook covers.<br />\nPeople such as the outraged<br />\nletter-writer invariably have no college<br />\nexperience and therefore believe that a<br />\ncollege education is valuable. They have<br />\nbeen denied the all-important credential,<br />\nthe degree. They nurse the wounds of<br />\ntheir lives with a series of \"If only I had<br />\ngone to college...\" excuses, and end up<br />\nreading about campus shenanigans in the<br />\nNews-American. And they have a right to<br />\nbe angry: we smoke dope for four years<br />\nand then earn $25,000 a year in<br />\nhigh-paying professions.<br />\nThe college degree was purcysed for<br />\nus at birth. We have to kill at least 16<br />\nyears in schools and colleges until we can<br />\ncollect on our parents' investment.<br />\nAlthough half of Hopkins students get<br />\n'some sort of financial aid, the average<br />\nfamily income is at least twice the<br />\nnational average.

We had the money. and the<br />\ncollege-oriented background to get in<br />\nhere. And among the key ingredients of<br />\nthat background are all those<br />\nextra-academic crutches and tricks that<br />\nenabled us to jive our way through<br />\nschool. Thank God for Monarch Notes<br />\nand SAT cram courses!<br /><br />\nIt seems impossible that only a few<br />\nshort years ago we got up at 7 am every<br />\nmorning, and went to seven classes a day.<br />\nWe were constantly harried by teachers<br />\nwho called on us in class, as well as by<br />\nhomework, quizzes and tests. We panted<br />\nfrom one room to the other, pausing, if<br />\nlucky, to go to our lockers. We were<br />\nburdened with late slips and detention,<br />\nand we schemed to miss a single class. We<br />\nwere, in fact, forced to crawl through<br />\nshit in order to get into college. But now<br />\nwe're here, and ain't it grand?<br />\nThanks to our intelligent parents who<br />\nbought us books and helped with our<br />\nhomework, it was inconceivable that we<br />\nwouldn't go to college. Exactly which<br />\ncollege we went to became a matter of<br />\nluck, money, and. in some cases. brains.<br />\nBut no matter where we wanted to go.<br />\nour basic aim was a degree. And buying a<br />\ntermpaper is just a part of the long and<br />\ndishonorable tradition of getting a<br />\ndegree.<br />\nFortunately for non-science majors at<br />\nHopkins. college is little more than an<br />\nexpensive summer camp. with lots of<br />\ntime for extra-curricular activities. The<br />\nsoftie \"disciplines** of the social sciences<br />\nand humanities have absolutely no value<br />\nwhatsoever in the real world. They are, as<br />\neveryone knows, mere stepping-stones to<br />\ngraduate or professional schools. Anci<br />\neven then, as the sad spectacle of<br />\nunemployed PhD's il!ustrates. all the<br />\neducation is close to worthless. It's quite<br />\n.ouching to see these :;()<br />\nadolescents driving taxicabs with their<br /><br />\ndoctorates proudly displayed on the<br />\nwindshield.<br />\nIt is, then, somehow very fitting that it<br />\nis possible to get a degree in a non-science<br />\nfield, and still have a mind of blue cheese<br />\nand the maturity of a 14-year-old flowei<br />\nchild. Through an ingenious combination<br />\nof pass-fail courses, independent study<br />\nincompletes. and, God bless 'em.<br />\ntermpapers, you can just float through<br />\nHopkins. Who would have thought, in<br />\nthose dark days of high school, that<br />\nsomeday we would be living in a paradise<br />\nwhere there are no parents, out<br />\ngirlfriends sleep with us and we car<br />\nsmoke dope in our own rooms?<br />\nYes, we have much to be thankful for<br />\nAnd what is the key to this miraculous<br />\nliberation?<br />\nThe termpaper.<br />\nBy judiciously choosing courses that<br />\nhave only termpapers. you can avoid<br />\ndoing any work until the last week of the<br />\nsemester. freeing yourself from the<br />\ndrudgery of academics.

The tragic grandeur of Euripides is rendered to the full<br />\nboth pictorially and vocally.<br />\nHow many directors have gone ahead and demolished the<br />\ngreatest monuments in literature, in dramatic art, in order to<br />\n'modernize' them according to their own poor taste. Cacoyannis<br />\ndoes not cheat. By being true to Euripides what he shows us,<br />\nwhat he makes us understand is the most actual of humanity's<br />\ntragedies ... the most contemporary, the most true of our past<br />\nand most permanently real.<br />\nThe film is harsh, simple, true.

Most people expected<br />\nLoyola to have little trouble with the<br />\nscrappy young Hopkins team, but<br />\nsomeone forgot to tell Rupert's boys,<br />\nwho were out to extend their three game<br />\nwinning streak.<br />\nQuickly overcoming a slow start, the<br />\nBlue Jays grabbed the lead early in the<br />\ngame as center Bill Jews dominated the<br />\ndefensive boards. Hopkins staved off a<br />\nGreyhound surge that saw Loyola take a<br />\nshort-lived 29-28 lead, when the Blue<br />\nJays, led by sophomore guards Bobby<br />\nFreedman and John Rutter, charged right<br />\nback to carry a 37-32 advantage into the<br />\nlocker room at halftime.<br />\nHaving shot a remarkable 67% from<br />\nthe floor, hitting on 14 of 21 shots in the<br />\nfirst half, the Blue Jays were ready to go<br />\nall out in the second half. They widened<br />\nthe gap to ten points as Rupert's varying<br />\nzone defense had the Greyhounds<br />\nstymied. The game could easily have<br />\nturned into a runaway at this point, were<br /><br />\nit not for nine key turnovers that kept<br />\nHopkins from putting points on the<br />\nscoreboard. According to Coach Rupert,<br />\n\"turnovers have been bugging us all year,<br />\nbut we are handling the ball much better<br />\nnow than we were earlier in the season.\"<br />\nWith thirteen minutes left to play,<br />\nLoyola finally settled down and began to<br />\nmake their shots count. Sparked by the<br />\nalert play of Gene Gwiazdowski and the<br />\nsuddenly unerring shooting of Ed Butler,<br />\nwho scored 16 of his game high 21 points<br />\nin the second half comeback, Loyola<br />\ntook command of the game. Outscoring<br />\nthe Blue Jays 17-5 over a five minute<br />\nperiod, the Greyhounds picked up the<br />\nmomentum that carried them to eventual<br />\nvictory.
