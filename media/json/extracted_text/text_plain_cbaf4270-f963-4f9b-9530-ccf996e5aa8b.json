Last Spring<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins chapter of the American ;Association<br />\nof University Professors passed a resolution urging the<br />\nUniversity administration to extend tenure to the associate<br />\nprofessorship level.<br />\nTenure is the term used, by way of explanation,<br />\nfor the right of a professor to hold his job, immune from<br />\narbitrary dismissal. A faculty member holding tenure can<br />\nhe dismissed from his position only after fair hearing at<br />\nwhich legitimate reasons for the termination of his professorship are put forth by the administration or department head.<br />\nUp to this point tenure extends only to full professors<br />\nhere at Johns Hopkins. Most universities have by now<br />\ngranted this important benefit to associate professors also.<br />\nThis would certainly be a wise step for the Hopkins<br />\nadministration to take. A scholar, having attained the position of associate professor, has established himself with the<br />\nUniversity and community. An assistant professor demonstrates his ability and reliability and is promoted to an<br />\nassociate position with added pay and prestige as inducement to remain at the university.

Perhaps<br />\nthis action was prompted by the fact that this year, for<br />\nthis first time, Goucher's dormitories house two Negro<br />\nfreshmen. A responsible administration would be evading<br />\nits duty if it took any other course of action.<br />\nThis laudable action tends to point up the striking<br />\nInaction on the part of our own faculty and administration.

In Dr. Wilcox's new<br />\nbook The United States and the<br />\nUnited Nations (just off the Hopkins Press) he analyzes the motives of Russian participation in<br />\nthe U.N. and how the veto has<br />\nbeen used to accomplish these<br />\nobjectives. \"In the U.N. there are<br />\nmany countries whose long range<br />\ngoals coincide with those of the<br />\n. \"Simply stated,<br />\nCharter.\".<br />\nthe goal of the U.N. is to help<br />\ncreate those conditions which<br />\nwill make it possible for man,<br />\nliving in peace with his neighbors, to enjoy material and<br />\nspiritual growth. . . .

The Soviet<br />\nUnion falls into the latter category.\"<br />\nBy use of the veto, a privilege<br />\nof the permanent members of the<br />\nSecurity Council, the USSR has<br />\nbeen able to control decisions in<br />\naccordance with her own objectives on all \"classified\" questions<br />\nsuch as admission of new members and revision of the Charter.<br />\nIn the General Assembly, the<br />\nveto technique has been used to<br />\nrefuse the financing of military<br />\naction when her interests have<br />\nbeen involved. By,refusing funds<br />\nfor certain specialized agencies<br />\nand insisting on a troika international control of disarmament<br />\nin Laos, the veto has been extended to every organ of the U.N.<br />\nas a paralyzing effect. The secretariat is the most recent move.<br />\nDr. Wilcox gives an indication<br />\nof his foresight in the veto problem in a lengthy discussion in<br />\nhis book Proposals for Changes<br />\nin the United Nations (1955)<br />\nproposing revision of the veto<br />\nprivilege.<br />\nDean Wilcox believes that a<br />\nsingle, strong Secretary General<br />\nis nr.ndatory for *the U.N.'s survival.

However U.S. agreement to debate<br />\nthe pros and cons by no means<br />\nsignifies a weakening of our opposition to Communist China's<br />\nadmission. The moratorium that<br />\nthe U.S. has been using the past<br />\nseveral years will no longer<br />\nwork. Last year we won the vote<br />\nby a narrow margin. The<br />\nSoviet Union has been putting<br />\nconstant pressure on this question by refusing to contribute to<br />\neconomic and social projects<br />\nuntil Red China is admitted. In<br />\nthis way the USSR is able to<br />\n<br />\nuse the non-admission of China<br />\nas a smoke screen for her lack<br />\nof cooperation in U.N. projects.<br />\nBy bringing the question out into<br />\nopen debate, the U.S. hopes to<br />\nshift rseponsibility for China's<br />\nnon-admittance to Red China<br />\nherself, for failing to meet the<br />\nqualifications of the Charter,<br />\nnotably Article 4: Membership in<br />\nthe U.N. is open to all other<br />\npeace-loving states'.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins University will $3000 for each year of the Fellowparticipate with seventy-seven ship.

Cleveland<br /><br />\nFaculty Tenure<br />\nThe subject of faculty tenure has been and still is a<br />\ncontroversial issue on many college campuses. Last Spring<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins chapter of the American ;Association<br />\nof University Professors passed a resolution urging the<br />\nUniversity administration to extend tenure to the associate<br />\nprofessorship level.<br />\nTenure is the term used, by way of explanation,<br />\nfor the right of a professor to hold his job, immune from<br />\narbitrary dismissal. A faculty member holding tenure can<br />\nhe dismissed from his position only after fair hearing at<br />\nwhich legitimate reasons for the termination of his professorship are put forth by the administration or department head.<br />\nUp to this point tenure extends only to full professors<br />\nhere at Johns Hopkins. Most universities have by now<br />\ngranted this important benefit to associate professors also.<br />\nThis would certainly be a wise step for the Hopkins<br />\nadministration to take. A scholar, having attained the position of associate professor, has established himself with the<br />\nUniversity and community. An assistant professor demonstrates his ability and reliability and is promoted to an<br />\nassociate position with added pay and prestige as inducement to remain at the university. He deserves the security<br />\nof tenure if he is expected to settle in the community, raise<br />\nhis family, and base his life around his university position.<br />\nAlthough this gives the departmental chairman somewhat less flexibility in handling his department, it will<br />\nimprove the calibre of the men he attracts and the conditions they work under. This University has been fortunate in not haying as yet any bitter conflicts resulting in<br />\nthe summary dismissal of a faculty member. However,<br />\nshould such a case arise it would be for the benefit of all<br />\nconcerned to hale a written tenure clause.<br /><br />\nGoucher Takes The Lead<br />\nIn the spirit of deep realization of a changing time,<br />\n68 members of the Goucher faculty have responded to the<br />\ncrying necessity of razing that crumbling wall of ignorance and fear\u2014racial bigotry and discrimination.<br />\nThese 68, among them Dr. Krashaur, Goucher's president, petitioned the various merchants in the suburb of<br />\nTowson, in which Goucher is a leading resident, to end<br />\ntheir, practice of racial exclusion of Negroes. Perhaps<br />\nthis action was prompted by the fact that this year, for<br />\nthis first time, Goucher's dormitories house two Negro<br />\nfreshmen. A responsible administration would be evading<br />\nits duty if it took any other course of action.<br />\nThis laudable action tends to point up the striking<br />\nInaction on the part of our own faculty and administration. Johns Hopkins, a far more complex and cosmopolitan<br />\ninstitution than Goucher, has students of countless nationalities and races. Yet the faculties and administrative<br />\noffices of this \"sophisticated\" university community have<br />\non the whole done little or nothing to even express, their<br />\n-disenchantment with the conditions of racial intolerance<br />\nin the surrounding community, and to a limited extent<br />\n;within the university structure itself.<br />\nAre the conditions in Baltimore vastly different from<br />\nthose in Towson?

In Dr. Wilcox's new<br />\nbook The United States and the<br />\nUnited Nations (just off the Hopkins Press) he analyzes the motives of Russian participation in<br />\nthe U.N. and how the veto has<br />\nbeen used to accomplish these<br />\nobjectives. \"In the U.N. there are<br />\nmany countries whose long range<br />\ngoals coincide with those of the<br />\n. \"Simply stated,<br />\nCharter.\".<br />\nthe goal of the U.N. is to help<br />\ncreate those conditions which<br />\nwill make it possible for man,<br />\nliving in peace with his neighbors, to enjoy material and<br />\nspiritual growth. . . .

The Soviet<br />\nUnion falls into the latter category.\"<br />\nBy use of the veto, a privilege<br />\nof the permanent members of the<br />\nSecurity Council, the USSR has<br />\nbeen able to control decisions in<br />\naccordance with her own objectives on all \"classified\" questions<br />\nsuch as admission of new members and revision of the Charter.<br />\nIn the General Assembly, the<br />\nveto technique has been used to<br />\nrefuse the financing of military<br />\naction when her interests have<br />\nbeen involved. By,refusing funds<br />\nfor certain specialized agencies<br />\nand insisting on a troika international control of disarmament<br />\nin Laos, the veto has been extended to every organ of the U.N.<br />\nas a paralyzing effect. The secretariat is the most recent move.<br />\nDr. Wilcox gives an indication<br />\nof his foresight in the veto problem in a lengthy discussion in<br />\nhis book Proposals for Changes<br />\nin the United Nations (1955)<br />\nproposing revision of the veto<br />\nprivilege.<br />\nDean Wilcox believes that a<br />\nsingle, strong Secretary General<br />\nis nr.ndatory for *the U.N.'s survival.

The conference jointly<br />\nsponkred by The Greater Baltimore Committee, The Johns<br />\nHopkins Univers,ity, and WJZTV met to take part in the<br />\nsearch for better solutions to<br />\nthe problems of modern urban<br />\nlife.<br />\nThe program is a type of<br />\n\"town meeting\" which uses television to link together informal<br />\ndiscussion groups around the<br />\nmetropolitan area.

K.<br />\nNehru, Indian Ambassador to the<br />\nU.S., or a candidate from Finland would have the objectivity<br />\nnecessary for the position.<br />\nAsked about the question of<br />\nRed China admission and the<br />\npossible weakening of U.S. foreign policy by acceptance of a<br />\ngeneral discussion of the issue,<br />\nDr. Wilcox said that the question<br />\nwould doubtlessly be of importance in the coming session. However U.S. agreement to debate<br />\nthe pros and cons by no means<br />\nsignifies a weakening of our opposition to Communist China's<br />\nadmission. The moratorium that<br />\nthe U.S. has been using the past<br />\nseveral years will no longer<br />\nwork. Last year we won the vote<br />\nby a narrow margin. The<br />\nSoviet Union has been putting<br />\nconstant pressure on this question by refusing to contribute to<br />\neconomic and social projects<br />\nuntil Red China is admitted. In<br />\nthis way the USSR is able to<br /><br />\nuse the non-admission of China<br />\nas a smoke screen for her lack<br />\nof cooperation in U.N. projects.<br />\nBy bringing the question out into<br />\nopen debate, the U.S. hopes to<br />\nshift rseponsibility for China's<br />\nnon-admittance to Red China<br />\nherself, for failing to meet the<br />\nqualifications of the Charter,<br />\nnotably Article 4: Membership in<br />\nthe U.N. is open to all other<br />\npeace-loving states'.<br />\n.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins University will $3000 for each year of the Fellowparticipate with seventy-seven ship.
