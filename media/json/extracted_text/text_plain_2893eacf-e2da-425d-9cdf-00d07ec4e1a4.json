APRIL 22, 1988<br />\nWe - annotoveremphaaize<br />\nthe importance of such a<br />\nA New Louncil<br />\nchange. Its necessity, for instance, was again demon'<br />\nstrated this week when the<br />\ncouncil announced that it<br />\nhas returned once more to a program of compulsory<br />\nassemblies. The correctness of this policy does not concern us at the moment. What seems to us of far greater<br />\nseriousness is the manner in which it was adopted. The<br />\ncouncil has simply presented the campus with a fait<br />\naccompli. That sort of star chamber proceeding is all<br />\ntoo common.<br />\nThere has been a great deal of talk around here lately<br />\nabout the right of so-called \"secret\" organizations to<br />\nconduct open meetings and assemblies on this campus.<br />\nLast winter, for example, the Young Communist league<br />\nwas denied that right. Persons with long memories<br />\nmight recall that, until the decision was announced,<br />\nthere_was no indication that the council was even<br />\nY C 'a ola\u2014rTo-ul.Q.r .ackAamnibLv.Feivr<br />\nre picked. We can't, under the circumstances,<br />\nimagine any underground revolutionary activity within<br />\nthe Y C L's capacity, which would make it any more<br />\ninimical to the public weal than, is the student council<br />\nwhen functioning by ukase.<br />\nOne ot<br />\ncorrespondenit'Weity..g elsewhere in thiii<br />\nissue, speaks of the \"grand council of Fascism.\" That<br />\nis ridiculous. The men now sitting on the council have<br />\nno pretensions to dictatorship. In almost every case they<br />\nare highly competent for their present offices. Their<br />\nonly fault is a certain deficiency 4f honest faith in the<br />\ndemocratic process.<br />\nWe become every day more convinced that, in the<br />\nend, the truth will out. If the campus doesn't like the<br />\ncouncil's assembly program,. then all the coercion in<br />\nthe world won't make it successful. And, it will take<br />\nmore than one evasive decision to quiet the unrpt<br />\nstired up by the case of the Young Communist league.<br />\nThe fundamental evil lies, not in the men, but in the<br />\nsystem. What we need is not just representatives who<br />\ncombine the best qualities of Alexander Hamilton and<br />\nThomas Jefferson. So long as they function along lines<br />\nlaid down by the Klu Klux Klan, any talk about popukr democracy is pure balderdash.<br />\nAnd, men who aspire to elective offices have got<br />\nto stop cheating their public. It is only fit and right that<br />\nthe campus should know what its leaders think.

Its necessity, for instance, was again demon'<br />\nstrated this week when the<br />\ncouncil announced that it<br />\nhas returned once more to a program of compulsory<br />\nassemblies. The correctness of this policy does not concern us at the moment. What seems to us of far greater<br />\nseriousness is the manner in which it was adopted. The<br />\ncouncil has simply presented the campus with a fait<br />\naccompli. That sort of star chamber proceeding is all<br />\ntoo common.<br />\nThere has been a great deal of talk around here lately<br />\nabout the right of so-called \"secret\" organizations to<br />\nconduct open meetings and assemblies on this campus.<br />\nLast winter, for example, the Young Communist league<br />\nwas denied that right.

Their<br />\nonly fault is a certain deficiency 4f honest faith in the<br />\ndemocratic process.<br />\nWe become every day more convinced that, in the<br />\nend, the truth will out. If the campus doesn't like the<br />\ncouncil's assembly program,. then all the coercion in<br />\nthe world won't make it successful. And, it will take<br />\nmore than one evasive decision to quiet the unrpt<br />\nstired up by the case of the Young Communist league.<br />\nThe fundamental evil lies, not in the men, but in the<br />\nsystem. What we need is not just representatives who<br />\ncombine the best qualities of Alexander Hamilton and<br />\nThomas Jefferson. So long as they function along lines<br />\nlaid down by the Klu Klux Klan, any talk about popukr democracy is pure balderdash.<br />\nAnd, men who aspire to elective offices have got<br />\nto stop cheating their public.
