The purpose of the<br />\nmeeting was to urge the United<br />\nStates Senate to ratify the treaties,<br />\nand a resolution to this effect was<br />\npassed.<br />\nMr. Theodore Marburg, who held<br />\nthe chair, reviewed the Senate's repeated chariness to pass arbitration<br />\ntreaties and recalled its rejection of<br />\nthe Olney-Pauncefoote treaty and<br />\nof the treaties arranged by Secretary Hay.<br />\nAmong the other speakers were<br />\nDean Charles L. Gregory, of the<br />\nLaw School of George Washington University, and Rear-Admiral<br />\nStockton, retired, of the United<br />\nStates Navy. Admiral Stockton<br />\nspoke of the treaties from the standpoint of a practical fighting man,<br />\nDean Kirchwey said that the objection to the ratification of the<br />\ntreaties were of three kinds: Legal,<br />\nsentimental and practical. As to the<br />\nfirst, he said that the Senate would<br />\nby no means be surrendering any<br />\nreal prerogative in ratifying the<br />\ngeneral treaty; as to the practical,<br />\nthat it is almost beyond the bounds<br />\nof human probability that, under the<br />\nmethods arranged by the treaty, any<br />\ndispute will be referred to arbitration which should not be so referred; and as to the sentimental,<br />\nthat in this age an arbitration treaty<br />\nis not mere waste-paper, but a real<br />\nfact, faithfully to be observed.<br />\nGillet Elected Captain.<br />\n<br />\nAt a dinner given to the football<br />\nmen on Thursday evening, at the<br />\nHotel Emerson, after the game,<br />\nGeorge M.

The remaining teams are those<br />\nagainst which Hopkins might reasonably be expected to make a good<br />\nshowing. Virginia, it is true, is a<br />\ntough proposition, but the ambition<br />\nto climb into a better class of athletic relations can never be gratified<br />\nuntil Hopkins can show herself<br />\nable to handle teams of the calibre<br />\nof Virginia. And yet the retrospect is not so dark, after all. There<br />\nremains .the St. John's game, with<br />\nits 2 to i odds and its newspaper<br />\nprophecies of defeat all overturned<br />\nby an exhibition of good, honest<br />\nfootball that outclassed the soldier<br />\nboys. As long as the St. John's<br />\ngame is a victory, the Hopkins football season is a success.<br />\nYet even in the victory there was<br />\na very unfortunate element. It<br />\nbrought the climax of the season<br />\ntoo early. Enthusiasm that had<br />\nbeen aroused to a high pitch before<br />\nthe Virginia game, reached its crest<br />\nthe next Saturday, and then suddenly dropped away to such an extent that Western Maryland defeated a team that had let down<br />\ndeplorably in tone from what it had<br />\nbeen two weeks before, and that<br />\nwas feebly supported by only a<br />\nhandful of cheerers and a hired \u2022<br />\nband. The past season has been a<br />\nwarning to those who attempt to<br />\npredict what will be and what might<br />\nhave been in football, but it is hard<br />\nto believe that the result would have<br />\nbeen the same if the Western Maryland game had come before that<br />\nwith St. John's.<br />\nBut if the schedule is open to<br />\ncriticism in this respect, the management is to be congratulated on<br />\nthe whole for the admirable aribangements that were made for the<br />\ngames. The Athletic Board and<br />\nthe managers have a difficult situation to face here in Baltimore, and<br />\nthey deserve credit for the tact that<br />\nis called for constantly. There are,<br />\nan endless number of details about<br />\nthe seating of the crowds, the accommodations for the players, the<br />\nprices to be charged, the advertising to be displayed, the cheering,<br />\nand whatnot, and almost anyone of<br />\nthese details may be arranged in<br />\nan endless number of ways.

Our schedule, it is<br />\ntrue, was a hard one, and three defeats were to be expected. The St.<br />\nJohn's game was won by a big<br />\nscore, but that doesn't make up for<br />\nthe miserable showing against Western Maryland on Thursday, our inferiority to Gettysburg, the failure<br />\nto score against Maryland Agricultural College, except on a fluke,<br />\nand the inability to cross Gallaudet's<br />\ngoal line except on a long run in<br />\nthe last part of the final period.<br />\nIt has already been urged that<br />\nHopkins should establish a fouryear rule, so that its football teams<br />\nwould have to be developed, instead<br />\nof relying on former stars who are<br />\nunable to attend practice regularly,<br />\nbut who, on the strength of their<br />\nreputations, are given places in the<br />\nline-up and depended upon, often<br />\nvainly, to be in physical condition<br />\nto play four gruelling periods and<br />\nwork together like a well-oiled, perfectly \u2022 trained machine. With a<br />\nfour-year rule, it is argued, the<br />\neleven men in the game, if not stars<br />\nof former glory, would form a team<br />\nand would be constantly developing,<br />\nso that this year's post-St. John's<br />\nslump wouldn't be duplicated.<br />\nThis season's experience, however, has not been due to the lack<br />\nof a four-year rule. Even if we<br />\nhad an elastic arrangernent by which<br />\nalumni could come back and play,<br />\nthere would be no serious injury to<br />\nHopkins football, so long as the<br />\ncoaches knew their business. That<br />\nhas been our salient weakness this<br />\nyear\u2014the inadequacy of the coaching department. With able coaches, the existence or non-existence<br />\nof the four-year rule wouldn't matter. In this connection, the letter<br />\n<br />\nThere was no cane rush between<br />\nthe halves of the football game on<br />\nSaturday, and arkother of the few<br />\nremaining Hopkins traditions went<br />\nby the board and scarcely caused<br />\na ripple. The rush was forbidden<br />\nby the authorities, because there<br />\nweren't enough freshmen in condition to take part, although in its<br />\nmodified form of the last four years,<br />\nthe battle for the cane is anything<br />\nbut dangerous.<br />\nWe are cooped up here in the<br />\ncenter of the city, with no campus<br />\nor dormitories, and it is not remarkable that with the small student<br />\nbody there are not more customs.<br />\nBut an effort certainly should be<br />\nmade to hold fast to those which<br />\nhave been started. This year, the<br />\nso-called rules that a freshman may<br />\nnot ride in the elevator until after<br />\nThanksgiving, and may not wear<br />\nhis hat in McCoy Hall until after<br />\nthe interclass game, were openly<br />\nviolated and no one objected. The<br />\nclass-rush has become a mere exchange of pleasantries, and it would<br />\nnot take away any of its roughness<br />\nif tea were served in the intermissions. The Hullabaloo hasn't<br />\nseen the light of day since 1909,<br />\nand the class pictures weren't taken<br />\nlast year.<br />\nWe have no. class day exercises,<br />\nwith the planting of ivy or other<br />\nsentimental but very dear customs,<br />\nwhich are regarded by the graduates at other institutiOns.

The only functions which<br />\nserve to make graduation something real and to be remembered,<br />\nare those given by the President<br />\nand Dean and the Senior Prom.<br />\nIt is well enough to say that<br />\nwhen we get to Homewood we will<br />\nstart some customs, but they can't<br />\nbe started.

BALTIMORE ST.<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1911.<br />\nMeeting the Co-eds, and Then--<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER has received<br />\nthe following puzzler for its query<br />\ncolumn:<br />\nDEAR GASSY Gus\u2014I can walk up to<br />\n<br />\na fellow, slap him on the back, and introduce myself. Is it etiquette for me<br />\nto do this with a co-ed? There are<br />\none or two that I want to meet, but I<br />\ncan't engineer it. '<br />\n<br />\nMALE UNDERGRADUATE.<br />\n<br />\nThis is a problem which some<br />\nmembers of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nBoard have been considering privately for some time, because there<br />\nare some co-eds that they want to<br />\nmeet, but can't arrange it. The graduate students are especially favored,<br />\nfor they associate in the classes with<br />\nthe fair members, and speaking relations can be very easily established in that fashion. The professor calls on Miss B., who is nonplussed for a moment. Then she<br />\nhears the necessary information<br />\ngiven sotto-voce by her masculine<br />\nneighbor, and she flashes him a<br />\nthankful glance. Who would deny<br />\nthat these two have been introduced?<br />\nOr, everyone will be agreed that<br />\nit would be perfectly proper for a<br />\nmale student to say to a female one,<br />\nafter the bell has rung and the<br />\nagony is over: \"Rotten lecture today, wasn't it? You can bet your<br />\nPuffs that I am glad that I only<br />\n'have two hours of this torture every<br />\nweek.\" And the co-ed, if she was<br />\nworthy of associating with real students in the classroom, would make<br />\na courteous reply. The next scene<br />\nwould be in Gordon's\u2014pardon me,<br />\nin the Dutch Tea Room, or in the<br />\nMaryland. When a professor calls<br />\nthe roll, it is universally understood<br />\nthat he is introducing the various<br />\nmembers of the class. The problem<br />\nfor the graduate students is, therefore, a simple one. The undergraduate question is different, but it<br />\nis THE NEWS-LETTER'S firm belief<br />\nthat, provided the undergraduate is<br />\nPresentable, and goes about it in a<br />\nright manner, he would be perfectly<br />\njustified in attempting to get acquainted.'<br />\nThere are ladies in each of the<br />\nlaboratories, and every scientific<br />\nstudent speaks to them. He would<br />\nbe deemed impolite if he didn't, but<br />\nthe introductions are few and far<br />\n<br />\n\"Going out to the game, Saturday ?\" is the feelerS number two,<br />\nsaid in a casual matter-of-fact tone.<br />\n\"I hadn't thought ninch. about it,<br />\nbut will be glad to go with you,\"<br />\nMiss B. replies eagerly, and everything is settled. The two then tell<br />\neach other their names; the man<br />\nlearns where to call; arrives on the<br />\ndot and has to wait the customary<br />\nfifteen minutes. They Converse in<br />\nthe usual fashion on the walk or<br />\nride to Homewood; walk the gantlet to their seats; the girlish treble<br />\nand manly basso cheer together, and<br />\nthen home to the boarding-house.<br />\nThe usual invitation to call again,<br />\nis given and accepted.<br />\nThe Ladies' Home Journal, which<br />\nwe understand the Library is soon<br />\nto put in the reading-room for the<br />\nco-eds, says that when two, people<br />\nmeet under the same roof, in the<br />\nhouse of a mutual friend, at a dance<br />\nor reception, for instance, they<br />\nshould recognize each other. Certainly, the case at Hopkins is identical. We all meet under one roof,<br />\nin the house presided over by President Remsen, and we should recognize each other. This is THE NEWSLETTER'S advice . to \"Male Undergraduate.\" Let those who want to,<br />\ntry. They can do no more than<br />\nfail. If those turned down will<br />\nsend their names to \"Gassy Gus,\"<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER will be pleased<br />\nto arrange for a reception at which<br />\nthe, necessary formal introductions<br />\ncan be performed.<br />\nTo act as a matrimonial bureau<br />\nis somewhat outside of the function<br />\nof a student publication, but toward<br />\nthe close of the year when the<br />\nparlous financial times begin, we<br />\nwouldn't mind in the least having<br />\nsome fat fees slipped us from those<br />\nmutual adorers whom we have enabled to find one another.<br />\nIf, on the other hand, there are<br />\nany co-eds who would like to meet<br />\nhandsome undergraduates,they need<br />\nonly send their names to \"Gassy<br />\nGus,\" and he will see that their desires are fulfilled. All communications will, of course, be in confidence.<br />\n<br />\nbetween. There are telephone operators and library assistants, and-<br />\n<br />\nspeaking relations are maintained<br />\nWith these. True, that the ordinary<br />\nroutine brings the student into contact with the ladies who, THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER has declared, greatly enhance the quality of English<br />\nWhich is used at Hopkins. But the<br />\nsame thing might be done with the<br />\nCo-eds. Mr. A. meets Miss B. in<br />\nthe corridor, or elevator.<br />\n\"Deucedly warm in here, don't<br />\nYou know,\" he advances tentatively.<br />\n\"Do you think so?\" is the doubtful reply, while Miss B. dives into<br />\nher carry-all for a powder puff and<br />\nsurreptitiously whitens the tip of<br />\nher delicious nose. That's the way<br />\na novel would accomplish the introduction. The next step would be<br />\neasier.<br />\n<br />\nto Students.

The purpose of the<br />\nmeeting was to urge the United<br />\nStates Senate to ratify the treaties,<br />\nand a resolution to this effect was<br />\npassed.<br />\nMr. Theodore Marburg, who held<br />\nthe chair, reviewed the Senate's repeated chariness to pass arbitration<br />\ntreaties and recalled its rejection of<br />\nthe Olney-Pauncefoote treaty and<br />\nof the treaties arranged by Secretary Hay.<br />\nAmong the other speakers were<br />\nDean Charles L. Gregory, of the<br />\nLaw School of George Washington University, and Rear-Admiral<br />\nStockton, retired, of the United<br />\nStates Navy. Admiral Stockton<br />\nspoke of the treaties from the standpoint of a practical fighting man,<br />\nDean Kirchwey said that the objection to the ratification of the<br />\ntreaties were of three kinds: Legal,<br />\nsentimental and practical. As to the<br />\nfirst, he said that the Senate would<br />\nby no means be surrendering any<br />\nreal prerogative in ratifying the<br />\ngeneral treaty; as to the practical,<br />\nthat it is almost beyond the bounds<br />\nof human probability that, under the<br />\nmethods arranged by the treaty, any<br />\ndispute will be referred to arbitration which should not be so referred; and as to the sentimental,<br />\nthat in this age an arbitration treaty<br />\nis not mere waste-paper, but a real<br />\nfact, faithfully to be observed.<br />\nGillet Elected Captain.<br /><br />\nAt a dinner given to the football<br />\nmen on Thursday evening, at the<br />\nHotel Emerson, after the game,<br />\nGeorge M.

The remaining teams are those<br />\nagainst which Hopkins might reasonably be expected to make a good<br />\nshowing. Virginia, it is true, is a<br />\ntough proposition, but the ambition<br />\nto climb into a better class of athletic relations can never be gratified<br />\nuntil Hopkins can show herself<br />\nable to handle teams of the calibre<br />\nof Virginia. And yet the retrospect is not so dark, after all. There<br />\nremains .the St. John's game, with<br />\nits 2 to i odds and its newspaper<br />\nprophecies of defeat all overturned<br />\nby an exhibition of good, honest<br />\nfootball that outclassed the soldier<br />\nboys. As long as the St. John's<br />\ngame is a victory, the Hopkins football season is a success.<br />\nYet even in the victory there was<br />\na very unfortunate element. It<br />\nbrought the climax of the season<br />\ntoo early. Enthusiasm that had<br />\nbeen aroused to a high pitch before<br />\nthe Virginia game, reached its crest<br />\nthe next Saturday, and then suddenly dropped away to such an extent that Western Maryland defeated a team that had let down<br />\ndeplorably in tone from what it had<br />\nbeen two weeks before, and that<br />\nwas feebly supported by only a<br />\nhandful of cheerers and a hired \u2022<br />\nband. The past season has been a<br />\nwarning to those who attempt to<br />\npredict what will be and what might<br />\nhave been in football, but it is hard<br />\nto believe that the result would have<br />\nbeen the same if the Western Maryland game had come before that<br />\nwith St. John's.<br />\nBut if the schedule is open to<br />\ncriticism in this respect, the management is to be congratulated on<br />\nthe whole for the admirable aribangements that were made for the<br />\ngames. The Athletic Board and<br />\nthe managers have a difficult situation to face here in Baltimore, and<br />\nthey deserve credit for the tact that<br />\nis called for constantly. There are,<br />\nan endless number of details about<br />\nthe seating of the crowds, the accommodations for the players, the<br />\nprices to be charged, the advertising to be displayed, the cheering,<br />\nand whatnot, and almost anyone of<br />\nthese details may be arranged in<br />\nan endless number of ways.

Our schedule, it is<br />\ntrue, was a hard one, and three defeats were to be expected. The St.<br />\nJohn's game was won by a big<br />\nscore, but that doesn't make up for<br />\nthe miserable showing against Western Maryland on Thursday, our inferiority to Gettysburg, the failure<br />\nto score against Maryland Agricultural College, except on a fluke,<br />\nand the inability to cross Gallaudet's<br />\ngoal line except on a long run in<br />\nthe last part of the final period.<br />\nIt has already been urged that<br />\nHopkins should establish a fouryear rule, so that its football teams<br />\nwould have to be developed, instead<br />\nof relying on former stars who are<br />\nunable to attend practice regularly,<br />\nbut who, on the strength of their<br />\nreputations, are given places in the<br />\nline-up and depended upon, often<br />\nvainly, to be in physical condition<br />\nto play four gruelling periods and<br />\nwork together like a well-oiled, perfectly \u2022 trained machine. With a<br />\nfour-year rule, it is argued, the<br />\neleven men in the game, if not stars<br />\nof former glory, would form a team<br />\nand would be constantly developing,<br />\nso that this year's post-St. John's<br />\nslump wouldn't be duplicated.<br />\nThis season's experience, however, has not been due to the lack<br />\nof a four-year rule. Even if we<br />\nhad an elastic arrangernent by which<br />\nalumni could come back and play,<br />\nthere would be no serious injury to<br />\nHopkins football, so long as the<br />\ncoaches knew their business. That<br />\nhas been our salient weakness this<br />\nyear\u2014the inadequacy of the coaching department. With able coaches, the existence or non-existence<br />\nof the four-year rule wouldn't matter. In this connection, the letter<br /><br />\nThere was no cane rush between<br />\nthe halves of the football game on<br />\nSaturday, and arkother of the few<br />\nremaining Hopkins traditions went<br />\nby the board and scarcely caused<br />\na ripple. The rush was forbidden<br />\nby the authorities, because there<br />\nweren't enough freshmen in condition to take part, although in its<br />\nmodified form of the last four years,<br />\nthe battle for the cane is anything<br />\nbut dangerous.<br />\nWe are cooped up here in the<br />\ncenter of the city, with no campus<br />\nor dormitories, and it is not remarkable that with the small student<br />\nbody there are not more customs.<br />\nBut an effort certainly should be<br />\nmade to hold fast to those which<br />\nhave been started. This year, the<br />\nso-called rules that a freshman may<br />\nnot ride in the elevator until after<br />\nThanksgiving, and may not wear<br />\nhis hat in McCoy Hall until after<br />\nthe interclass game, were openly<br />\nviolated and no one objected. The<br />\nclass-rush has become a mere exchange of pleasantries, and it would<br />\nnot take away any of its roughness<br />\nif tea were served in the intermissions. The Hullabaloo hasn't<br />\nseen the light of day since 1909,<br />\nand the class pictures weren't taken<br />\nlast year.<br />\nWe have no. class day exercises,<br />\nwith the planting of ivy or other<br />\nsentimental but very dear customs,<br />\nwhich are regarded by the graduates at other institutiOns. At Hopkins, the fourth-year men hire<br />\ngowns, attend the Commencement,<br />\nget their diplomas and then disperse.

BALTIMORE ST.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1911.<br />\nMeeting the Co-eds, and Then--<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER has received<br />\nthe following puzzler for its query<br />\ncolumn:<br />\nDEAR GASSY Gus\u2014I can walk up to<br /><br />\na fellow, slap him on the back, and introduce myself. Is it etiquette for me<br />\nto do this with a co-ed? There are<br />\none or two that I want to meet, but I<br />\ncan't engineer it. '<br /><br />\nMALE UNDERGRADUATE.<br /><br />\nThis is a problem which some<br />\nmembers of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nBoard have been considering privately for some time, because there<br />\nare some co-eds that they want to<br />\nmeet, but can't arrange it. The graduate students are especially favored,<br />\nfor they associate in the classes with<br />\nthe fair members, and speaking relations can be very easily established in that fashion. The professor calls on Miss B., who is nonplussed for a moment. Then she<br />\nhears the necessary information<br />\ngiven sotto-voce by her masculine<br />\nneighbor, and she flashes him a<br />\nthankful glance. Who would deny<br />\nthat these two have been introduced?<br />\nOr, everyone will be agreed that<br />\nit would be perfectly proper for a<br />\nmale student to say to a female one,<br />\nafter the bell has rung and the<br />\nagony is over: \"Rotten lecture today, wasn't it? You can bet your<br />\nPuffs that I am glad that I only<br />\n'have two hours of this torture every<br />\nweek.\" And the co-ed, if she was<br />\nworthy of associating with real students in the classroom, would make<br />\na courteous reply. The next scene<br />\nwould be in Gordon's\u2014pardon me,<br />\nin the Dutch Tea Room, or in the<br />\nMaryland. When a professor calls<br />\nthe roll, it is universally understood<br />\nthat he is introducing the various<br />\nmembers of the class. The problem<br />\nfor the graduate students is, therefore, a simple one. The undergraduate question is different, but it<br />\nis THE NEWS-LETTER'S firm belief<br />\nthat, provided the undergraduate is<br />\nPresentable, and goes about it in a<br />\nright manner, he would be perfectly<br />\njustified in attempting to get acquainted.'<br />\nThere are ladies in each of the<br />\nlaboratories, and every scientific<br />\nstudent speaks to them. He would<br />\nbe deemed impolite if he didn't, but<br />\nthe introductions are few and far<br /><br />\n\"Going out to the game, Saturday ?\" is the feelerS number two,<br />\nsaid in a casual matter-of-fact tone.<br />\n\"I hadn't thought ninch. about it,<br />\nbut will be glad to go with you,\"<br />\nMiss B. replies eagerly, and everything is settled. The two then tell<br />\neach other their names; the man<br />\nlearns where to call; arrives on the<br />\ndot and has to wait the customary<br />\nfifteen minutes. They Converse in<br />\nthe usual fashion on the walk or<br />\nride to Homewood; walk the gantlet to their seats; the girlish treble<br />\nand manly basso cheer together, and<br />\nthen home to the boarding-house.<br />\nThe usual invitation to call again,<br />\nis given and accepted.<br />\nThe Ladies' Home Journal, which<br />\nwe understand the Library is soon<br />\nto put in the reading-room for the<br />\nco-eds, says that when two, people<br />\nmeet under the same roof, in the<br />\nhouse of a mutual friend, at a dance<br />\nor reception, for instance, they<br />\nshould recognize each other. Certainly, the case at Hopkins is identical. We all meet under one roof,<br />\nin the house presided over by President Remsen, and we should recognize each other. This is THE NEWSLETTER'S advice . to \"Male Undergraduate.\" Let those who want to,<br />\ntry. They can do no more than<br />\nfail. If those turned down will<br />\nsend their names to \"Gassy Gus,\"<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER will be pleased<br />\nto arrange for a reception at which<br />\nthe, necessary formal introductions<br />\ncan be performed.<br />\nTo act as a matrimonial bureau<br />\nis somewhat outside of the function<br />\nof a student publication, but toward<br />\nthe close of the year when the<br />\nparlous financial times begin, we<br />\nwouldn't mind in the least having<br />\nsome fat fees slipped us from those<br />\nmutual adorers whom we have enabled to find one another.<br />\nIf, on the other hand, there are<br />\nany co-eds who would like to meet<br />\nhandsome undergraduates,they need<br />\nonly send their names to \"Gassy<br />\nGus,\" and he will see that their desires are fulfilled. All communications will, of course, be in confidence.<br /><br />\nbetween. There are telephone operators and library assistants, and-<br /><br />\nspeaking relations are maintained<br />\nWith these. True, that the ordinary<br />\nroutine brings the student into contact with the ladies who, THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER has declared, greatly enhance the quality of English<br />\nWhich is used at Hopkins. But the<br />\nsame thing might be done with the<br />\nCo-eds. Mr. A. meets Miss B. in<br />\nthe corridor, or elevator.<br />\n\"Deucedly warm in here, don't<br />\nYou know,\" he advances tentatively.<br />\n\"Do you think so?\" is the doubtful reply, while Miss B. dives into<br />\nher carry-all for a powder puff and<br />\nsurreptitiously whitens the tip of<br />\nher delicious nose. That's the way<br />\na novel would accomplish the introduction. The next step would be<br />\neasier.<br /><br />\nto Students.
