His actions in<br />\nopening up the Board of Trustees to younger and more diverse<br />\nviews seen in the election of the four new Board members are<br />\nworthy of our enthusiastic applause. In addition, the interim<br />\npresident's genuine concern for the undergraduate is apparent<br />\nand his support for more teaching and more undergraduate<br />\ncourses is quite welcome. But, according to the president's<br />\nspeech, there will soon be 600 more undergraduates taking<br />\nthese courses. It is imperative that the increase in courses<br />\ncomes before the increase in students or the quality of the<br />\nundergraduate program will continue to decline. Now, we<br />\nhave a president asking a faculty to increase their teaching<br />\nload, but if that request does not become reality, neither<br />\nshould the increase in students, or we might find ourselves<br />\nwith 600 bodies who have no place to go but the back of Rem sen<br />\n1. Apparently they won't even be able to go to an interim<br />\nstudent union, a fact that will not aid in attracting 600 more<br />\nquality students to an admittedly drab city.<br />\nThe election of the new members to the Board could also fail<br />\nto realize its full promise. If these new Trustees are to be more<br />\nthan novelties then they should be treated with the same<br />\nrespect as the others and have a meaningful opportunity to<br />\nshape University policies. Serious consideration, then, should<br />\nbe given to placing the new members on the most important<br />\ncommittees of the Board, including the Executive Committee.<br />\nIf Dr. Eisenhower is truly interested in having diverse views<br />\nenter into the running of the University, perhaps he could see<br />\nwhat he can do about getting some current students on the<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\nFor improving the undergraduate program, Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nis putting his faith in a graduate-oriented senior faculty.<br />\nSeemingly they have promised some substantive changes. But<br />\nlet us hope that their graduate orientation does make these<br />\nchanges a one-shot deal, that will fade as soon as the current<br />\ncooperative spirit wanes. Only a forceful effort by Dr.<br />\nEisenhower, comparable to the dynamic achievement of his<br />\nprevious tenure, will ensure that this is not the case.<br />\n<br />\nWickwire Courses<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire went before the Academic Council the<br />\nother day to defend his social action courses, which had been<br />\nattacked by the Zdanis Committee on Non-Departmental<br />\nCourses and other faculty members. Wickwire's critics say<br />\nthat his courses lack proper academic content, and that there<br />\nis an absence of supervision in the field courses. Wickwire<br />\npresented to the senior scholars of the Council authoritative<br />\nevidence of the new scholarly approaches from the reports of<br />\nthree educational commissions. \"What they are saying,\" he<br />\ntold them, \"is that there are other ways to teach besides<br />\nhaving the student and teacher on opposite sides of the desk.\"<br />\nWe urge the Academic Council in their deliberations next week<br />\nto consider the precedents set by other fine institutions, the<br />\nwishes of the Hopkins community and the importance of the<br />\nWickwire courses. These urban-involvement courses are a<br />\nmost valuable addition to the Hopkins academic program and<br />\nthey should be preserved.<br />\nWickwire's four undergraduate courses offer a unique<br />\nacademic experience at least as valid as the other courses on<br />\nthe Homewood program. In addition, they have vital field<br />\nprograms which translate their learning into the reality of<br />\nsocial action. The 1500 members of the normally apathetic<br />\nHopkins community who signed a petition supporting Wickwire should not be ignored merely because the Academic<br />\nCouncil members have a more arcahic view of what<br />\nscholarship should be.<br />\nthe news-letter is published twice each week during the school<br />\nyear by the students of the johns hopkins university, homewood<br />\ncampus, baltimore, maryland. editorial and business correspondence should be addressed to box 1230, the johns hopkins university, baltimore, 21218; telephone 301-366-3300, extension 1308.<br />\nsubscriptions $8 per annum. member, columbia scholastic press<br />\nassociation.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nROCK TROUBLES<br />\nProgressive rock radio is<br />\nin trouble throughout the<br />\nUnited States.

Without delegated<br />\nauthority, individual responsibility is not<br />\naccepted by committee participants for<br />\ndecisions which affect university policy.<br />\nCommittees are formed by administrators<br />\nwith an end result in mind that serves their<br />\nown bureaucratic requirements.<br />\nCommittees have not frequently been the<br />\ninitiators of policy changes, and thus have<br />\nproved themselves to be unresponsive to<br />\npressing university needs. Committees have<br />\nbecome a mechanism for preserving the<br />\nstatus quo, serving to legitimize prior administrative decisions, and their own<br />\nexistence.<br />\nThe performance of the committee system<br />\ncan only be evaluated by its actions, for its<br />\nprocesses are often obscure to both the<br />\nparticipants and the observers. From the<br />\nundergraduate perspective, the committee<br />\nsystem by its past actions has proven to be a<br />\nfailure and an aberration. The Student<br />\nConduct Code proposed by a committee<br />\ncomposed of students and faculty (the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee) was successively overturned by the President and<br />\nthe Dean with no consultation of students.<br />\nThe Governance Committee, formed<br />\nunder pressure for change, was given such a<br />\nnarrow scope of possible action that it could<br />\nonly confirm the existing system, or those<br />\nmodifications to it which were suitable to the<br />\nDean. Where the administration or its<br />\nfaculty equivalent, the Academic Council,<br />\nperceives a threat to the prevailing<br />\nacademic environment, it quickly refers it to<br />\na committee to diminish or destroy the<br />\nBaker is Co-President of the Student .issociation<br />\nand Ohly is a meltber of the Arts and Sciences<br />\nAdvisory Council; both are juniors.<br />\n<br />\nthreat. Thus, the creation of the Zdanis<br />\nCommittee to study non-departmental<br />\ncourse offerings, with the specific aim of<br />\ncastrating progressive course offerings<br />\ncentered in Levering Hall.<br />\nPerhaps the most conspicuous of these<br />\ncoordinated efforts at maintaining the<br />\nlegitimacy of the present University<br />\nrelationships in face of dire need for change,<br />\nlies with the Committee to Select a New<br />\nDean of Undergraduate Studies. The<br />\nCommittee's choices were preempted by the<br />\nlimitations imposed upon it by the faculty<br />\ntenure system and qualifications fol the<br />\noffice as ceen by Deans Benton and Strider.<br />\nDean Strider, delegated authority by Dean<br />\nBenton, initially decided the composition<br />\nand membership of the committee, retaining<br />\nultimate veto power over any selection, and<br />\nlimited prospective candidates to senior<br />\nmembers of the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nGiven this type of committee it seems<br />\ninevitable that the choice would be an obscure personality like Dr. Sigmund<br />\nSuskind, who is virtually unknown to undergraduates, knows little about therr \u2022 and<br />\nshows no desire to communicate to us his<br />\nconception of the position and its future.<br />\nThe selections process was inherently<br />\ninconsiderate and unfair to undergraduates<br />\nand was therefore doomed from its inception. Its apparent failure should be taken<br />\nas an object lesson, showing the necessity of<br />\ngreater consultation and participation of<br />\nundergraduates where their interests are<br />\ndirectly concerned. The only way in which<br />\nsome semblance of democracy can be<br />\nsalvaged is by conducting a referendum in<br />\nwhich undergraduates may approve or veto<br />\nthe choice of the committee.<br />\n<br />\n\fApril 16, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nJR=<br />\nCity Chevrolet: Dinah Shore WalWrong<br />\nBy TED ROHRLICH<br />\nNew car dealerships.. plush<br />\nshowrooms, courteous salesmen,<br />\nopulence in a poor neighborhood.<br />\nBut you only see that once.<br />\nThe next time and the next time<br />\nand the time after that you see the<br />\nservice department, where all of a<br />\nsudden the fact that you laid down<br />\ntwo or three thousand for a car<br />\ndoesn't mean shit.<br />\nWhat means shit is that you're<br />\nthere, your car's sitting apart in<br />\nthe shop, you don't know the first<br />\nthing about what's wrong and<br />\nthey've got you for whatever price<br />\nstrikes their fancy.<br />\nYou complain--with visions of<br />\nRalph Nader dancing in your head,<br />\nsugarplums and all.<br />\nTry it sometime.

The problem was analyzed<br />\nand the solution termed a valve<br />\njob, which was performed after two<br />\nweeks of exhiliarating dialogue<br />\nlike:<br />\n\"I think this is under warranty.\"<br />\n\"No it's not.\"<br />\nFinally, when my options were<br />\nexhausted. I gave in and told them<br />\nto go ahead and fix the car, which<br />\nthey did, one week and $188 later.<br />\nThis is the story of those options<br />\nand how, one Friday afternoon<br />\nwhen all was right with the world,<br />\nbut not my car, I discovered that I<br />\nhad indeed been ripped off. You<br />\nsee, not only was the warranty<br />\nquestion resolved in their favor, but<br />\nthe car still wouldn't run. It wasn't<br />\nthe valves after all, it was the<br />\nclutch, which went out completely<br />\nten miles after I pulled out of City<br />\nChevrolet. That's how I wound up<br />\nin the service manager's office-after stopping payment on my<br />\ncheck. But back to the options:<br />\nOn March 22 I took my car to City<br />\nChevrolet, told the service lane<br />\nattendant the problem and asked<br />\nhim to fix the car. That afternoon<br />\nhe called me to come down and<br />\ntake a look as I'd requested. He told<br />\nme that my valves were sticking<br />\nbecause of an awful case of carbon<br />\naccumulation. Not knowing how<br />\nmuch carbon is normal, I accepted<br />\n<br />\nhis word for it.<br />\nI asked him what causes such a<br />\nproblem and he answered \"General<br />\ndriving conditions.\" He said there<br />\nwas no defect in parts.<br />\nNow, I don't know much about<br />\ncars, but this seemed suspect. The<br />\ncar had been driven normally, not<br />\nabusively, for a little over 32,000<br />\nmiles.<br />\nSo I asked him how to get a<br />\nfactory representative to come<br />\ndown and decide the warranty<br />\nquestion. He told me that I would<br />\nhave to call him myself.<br />\nI called Frank Fields in customer<br />\nrelations at the Chevrolet zone<br />\noffice and he told me that I could<br />\nnot request a factory representative, that the request had to be<br />\nmade by the service manager, Al<br />\nZuk.<br />\nSo I talked to Zuk who tried to<br />\nconvince me that the item in<br />\nquestion was not covered by my<br />\nwarranty, but was due to \"general<br />\ndriving conditions.\"<br />\nI asked him for about the fourth<br />\ntime to call back Fields and each<br />\ntime he said that I had to call<br />\nFields, not he. Each time I explained that Fields had told me that<br />\nZuk had to call him. Finally I<br />\npersuaded Zuk to call. After a<br />\nprolonged discussion Zuk hung<br />\nup, told me that Fields agreed with<br />\n<br />\nhim, and said I would have to call<br />\nFields myself.<br />\nI made a comment about \"runarounds\" and Zuk told me that this<br />\nwas standard procedure, that<br />\nChevrolet doesn't send a factory<br />\nrepresentative every time someone<br />\nrequests one. It seems you have to<br />\nprove that you're serious by<br />\nrequesting one several times.<br />\nThis wouldn't be too bad except<br />\nfor the fact that there's an average<br />\nfifteen minute waiting time to get<br />\nFields on the phone.<br />\nI made the ten-minute walk back<br />\nto campus and called Fields immediately. He had gone for the day.<br />\nThe next morning I called Fields<br />\nbright and early, waited my fifteen<br />\nminutes and went through my<br />\nwhole story again. He went through<br />\nhis whole story again. I started to<br />\nget mad.<br />\nFinally, he promised to send a<br />\nfactory representative to look at<br />\nthe car sometime late in the<br />\nfollowing week. He explained that<br />\nthere were only two persons who<br />\ntravelled around to dealerships<br />\n(Later I found out , there were<br />\ntwelve.) and none would be<br />\navailable before that time. I said<br />\nfine and that seemed to surprise<br />\nhim.<br />\n(continued On pap. 8)<br />\n<br />\nflowers<br />\n<br />\nmelvin hecht<br />\n<br />\n\fApril 16, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\n`Cherrydrops'freshman folk opera<br />\nBy JOHN CAMPION<br />\nA new type of folk opera was<br />\nrecently composed by two Hopkins<br />\nfreshmen, Mitchel Clarvit and<br />\nbennis Perman, as a joint<br />\nminimester project for writing<br />\nseminars.<br />\n\"Cherrydrops\" isn't a rock or a<br />\nclassical opera, it's our story with<br />\nour music. Don't compare it with<br />\nrock,\" said composer Perman.<br />\nThe opera developed from music<br />\nClarvit was composing in the<br />\nsummer of 1970. At that time, he was<br />\nreminded of a personal fantasy, an<br />\nisland paradise named Cherrydrops,<br />\nwhere there was perpetual peace<br />\nand happiness.<br />\nIncentive<br />\nThis was the inspiration for the<br />\nfolk opera, but it didn't get very far<br />\nuntil Clarvit came to Hopkins and<br />\nbegan jamming with Dennis Perman. The incentive to get<br />\nCherrydrops written came when a<br />\nWords and Ideas instructor offered<br />\nto sponsor their work as a joint<br />\nminimester project for academic<br />\ncredit.<br />\nThe opera is based on a ManianTolkien myth formulated by Perman and Clarvit. But like other<br />\nmore to<br />\noperas, there's<br />\nCherrydrops than a simplistic story<br />\nline. The real strength of the opera<br />\nis, in fact, in the music, with many<br />\nof the movements being instrumentals.<br />\n\"This is transfer of emotion<br />\nmusic,\" said Clarvit. \"The music<br />\nitself creates a mood.\"<br />\nPerman expressed a sense of<br />\naccomplishment in composing<br />\nCherrydrops. \"I felt a realization of<br />\nthe ability to write a unified work<br />\nwhich can affect others the way it<br />\naffects me. It's pride in conveying a<br />\n<br />\nCherrydrops has been casted by<br />\nits composers, and is presently<br />\nbeing taped.

He said I should call him.<br />\nI arrived back in town over the<br />\nweekend of April 3 and called<br />\nFields on Monday morning. He said<br />\nhe didn't know the results of the<br />\ninspection and told me to call Zuk. I<br />\ntold him that I'd had enough trips<br />\non the merry-go-round. He said he<br />\nwould call Zuk, find out, and get<br />\nback in touch with me. After two<br />\nhours, I called him back.<br />\nHe told me that a Mr. Lassiter<br />\nhad looked at the car and decided<br />\nthe problem was not under<br />\nwarranty.<br />\nSo I called back City, tired of<br />\nhassling and told them to go ahead<br />\nand fix the car.<br />\nThey told me the car would be<br />\nready Wednesday. It was ready<br />\nFriday afternoon.<br />\n(Later I called Mr. Lassiter. His<br />\ncomments inspired my everlasting<br />\ntrust in Chevrolet: \"I don't recall<br />\nlooking at carbon accumulation...I<br />\nwasn't in there.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe said he'd get back in touch<br />\nwith me after checking with Zuk to<br />\nfind out who had looked at the car.<br />\nAfter waiting two hours I called<br />\nhimback.<br />\n\"I didn't look at your car. Unless<br />\nFields had Shoreman look at it, I<br />\ndon't know.. I'm going to have to<br />\ntalk with Fields and see.\" Fields<br />\nwas on vacation. Zuk told me that<br />\nShoreman looked at it. Shoreman<br />\nwas unavailable for comment.

Monday<br />\nmorning I also called the bank and<br />\nstopped payment on my check to<br />\nCity Chevrolet.<br />\nI related this whole story to Zuk<br />\nand Helwig (the City Chevrolet<br />\ntreasurer) on Wednesday.

LENROW<br />\nThere are times of special<br />\ndelight in every sport that<br />\nshow how the human efforts<br />\nof athletes can be outstanding. There are countless<br />\nstories of how an athlete may<br />\nbe injored and still play.<br />\nThe Baltimore Bullets are<br />\nshowing just how far a team<br />\ncan go when injured. The<br />\nBullets, without their all-star<br />\nforward<br />\nGus<br />\nJohnson,<br />\nwithout super-sub Eddie<br />\nMiles, and without the services of starting guard Kevin<br />\nLoughery blew the New York<br />\nKnicks out of the Civic Center<br />\ntwice.<br />\nThe Knicks came to<br />\nBaltimore last weekend with<br />\na two game to nothing lead in<br />\nthe best-of-seven Eastern<br />\nDivision Championship. They<br />\nreturn to New York tied at<br />\ntwo games apiece.<br />\nThe Bullets, who had been<br />\nwithout Miles and Johnson in<br />\nthe first two games, also lost<br />\nthe services of Loughery, who<br />\nhad injured his heel on<br />\nSunday, while he saw limited<br />\n<br />\naction Wednesday. The<br />\nBullets were down to eight<br />\nminimum<br />\nplayers, the<br />\nnumber allowed in the<br />\nNational Basketball<br />\nAssociation.<br />\nThe starting lineup contained two players who had<br />\nbeen used solely as substitutes throughout the<br />\nseason. Possibly the Knicks<br />\njust weren't up for the game,<br />\nmaybe Willis Reed's injuries<br />\nwere more serious than<br />\nimagined; these are only<br />\nspeculations.<br />\nThe truth is that the Bullets<br />\nknew that they could not get<br />\ninto foul trouble, they knew<br />\nthey all had to hve good<br />\nnights, and moreover they<br />\nknew that if they lost, they<br />\nwere probably out of the<br />\nplayoffs.<br />\nThe last two years the<br />\nKnicks have played the<br />\nBullets in the playoffs. Two<br />\nyears ago, the Bullets'<br />\n'Cinderella' season when they<br />\njumped from last place to<br />\nfirst place in one season, the<br />\nKnicks destroyed the Bullets<br />\n<br />\nfour games to none.<br />\nLast year, the Bullets faced<br />\nthe Knicks again in the<br />\nEastern Division Finals.

His actions in<br />\nopening up the Board of Trustees to younger and more diverse<br />\nviews seen in the election of the four new Board members are<br />\nworthy of our enthusiastic applause. In addition, the interim<br />\npresident's genuine concern for the undergraduate is apparent<br />\nand his support for more teaching and more undergraduate<br />\ncourses is quite welcome. But, according to the president's<br />\nspeech, there will soon be 600 more undergraduates taking<br />\nthese courses. It is imperative that the increase in courses<br />\ncomes before the increase in students or the quality of the<br />\nundergraduate program will continue to decline. Now, we<br />\nhave a president asking a faculty to increase their teaching<br />\nload, but if that request does not become reality, neither<br />\nshould the increase in students, or we might find ourselves<br />\nwith 600 bodies who have no place to go but the back of Rem sen<br />\n1. Apparently they won't even be able to go to an interim<br />\nstudent union, a fact that will not aid in attracting 600 more<br />\nquality students to an admittedly drab city.<br />\nThe election of the new members to the Board could also fail<br />\nto realize its full promise. If these new Trustees are to be more<br />\nthan novelties then they should be treated with the same<br />\nrespect as the others and have a meaningful opportunity to<br />\nshape University policies. Serious consideration, then, should<br />\nbe given to placing the new members on the most important<br />\ncommittees of the Board, including the Executive Committee.<br />\nIf Dr. Eisenhower is truly interested in having diverse views<br />\nenter into the running of the University, perhaps he could see<br />\nwhat he can do about getting some current students on the<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\nFor improving the undergraduate program, Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nis putting his faith in a graduate-oriented senior faculty.<br />\nSeemingly they have promised some substantive changes. But<br />\nlet us hope that their graduate orientation does make these<br />\nchanges a one-shot deal, that will fade as soon as the current<br />\ncooperative spirit wanes. Only a forceful effort by Dr.<br />\nEisenhower, comparable to the dynamic achievement of his<br />\nprevious tenure, will ensure that this is not the case.<br /><br />\nWickwire Courses<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire went before the Academic Council the<br />\nother day to defend his social action courses, which had been<br />\nattacked by the Zdanis Committee on Non-Departmental<br />\nCourses and other faculty members. Wickwire's critics say<br />\nthat his courses lack proper academic content, and that there<br />\nis an absence of supervision in the field courses. Wickwire<br />\npresented to the senior scholars of the Council authoritative<br />\nevidence of the new scholarly approaches from the reports of<br />\nthree educational commissions. \"What they are saying,\" he<br />\ntold them, \"is that there are other ways to teach besides<br />\nhaving the student and teacher on opposite sides of the desk.\"<br />\nWe urge the Academic Council in their deliberations next week<br />\nto consider the precedents set by other fine institutions, the<br />\nwishes of the Hopkins community and the importance of the<br />\nWickwire courses. These urban-involvement courses are a<br />\nmost valuable addition to the Hopkins academic program and<br />\nthey should be preserved.<br />\nWickwire's four undergraduate courses offer a unique<br />\nacademic experience at least as valid as the other courses on<br />\nthe Homewood program. In addition, they have vital field<br />\nprograms which translate their learning into the reality of<br />\nsocial action. The 1500 members of the normally apathetic<br />\nHopkins community who signed a petition supporting Wickwire should not be ignored merely because the Academic<br />\nCouncil members have a more arcahic view of what<br />\nscholarship should be.<br />\nthe news-letter is published twice each week during the school<br />\nyear by the students of the johns hopkins university, homewood<br />\ncampus, baltimore, maryland. editorial and business correspondence should be addressed to box 1230, the johns hopkins university, baltimore, 21218; telephone 301-366-3300, extension 1308.<br />\nsubscriptions $8 per annum. member, columbia scholastic press<br />\nassociation.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nROCK TROUBLES<br />\nProgressive rock radio is<br />\nin trouble throughout the<br />\nUnited States.

Without delegated<br />\nauthority, individual responsibility is not<br />\naccepted by committee participants for<br />\ndecisions which affect university policy.<br />\nCommittees are formed by administrators<br />\nwith an end result in mind that serves their<br />\nown bureaucratic requirements.<br />\nCommittees have not frequently been the<br />\ninitiators of policy changes, and thus have<br />\nproved themselves to be unresponsive to<br />\npressing university needs. Committees have<br />\nbecome a mechanism for preserving the<br />\nstatus quo, serving to legitimize prior administrative decisions, and their own<br />\nexistence.<br />\nThe performance of the committee system<br />\ncan only be evaluated by its actions, for its<br />\nprocesses are often obscure to both the<br />\nparticipants and the observers. From the<br />\nundergraduate perspective, the committee<br />\nsystem by its past actions has proven to be a<br />\nfailure and an aberration. The Student<br />\nConduct Code proposed by a committee<br />\ncomposed of students and faculty (the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee) was successively overturned by the President and<br />\nthe Dean with no consultation of students.<br />\nThe Governance Committee, formed<br />\nunder pressure for change, was given such a<br />\nnarrow scope of possible action that it could<br />\nonly confirm the existing system, or those<br />\nmodifications to it which were suitable to the<br />\nDean. Where the administration or its<br />\nfaculty equivalent, the Academic Council,<br />\nperceives a threat to the prevailing<br />\nacademic environment, it quickly refers it to<br />\na committee to diminish or destroy the<br />\nBaker is Co-President of the Student .issociation<br />\nand Ohly is a meltber of the Arts and Sciences<br />\nAdvisory Council; both are juniors.<br /><br />\nthreat. Thus, the creation of the Zdanis<br />\nCommittee to study non-departmental<br />\ncourse offerings, with the specific aim of<br />\ncastrating progressive course offerings<br />\ncentered in Levering Hall.<br />\nPerhaps the most conspicuous of these<br />\ncoordinated efforts at maintaining the<br />\nlegitimacy of the present University<br />\nrelationships in face of dire need for change,<br />\nlies with the Committee to Select a New<br />\nDean of Undergraduate Studies. The<br />\nCommittee's choices were preempted by the<br />\nlimitations imposed upon it by the faculty<br />\ntenure system and qualifications fol the<br />\noffice as ceen by Deans Benton and Strider.<br />\nDean Strider, delegated authority by Dean<br />\nBenton, initially decided the composition<br />\nand membership of the committee, retaining<br />\nultimate veto power over any selection, and<br />\nlimited prospective candidates to senior<br />\nmembers of the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nGiven this type of committee it seems<br />\ninevitable that the choice would be an obscure personality like Dr. Sigmund<br />\nSuskind, who is virtually unknown to undergraduates, knows little about therr \u2022 and<br />\nshows no desire to communicate to us his<br />\nconception of the position and its future.<br />\nThe selections process was inherently<br />\ninconsiderate and unfair to undergraduates<br />\nand was therefore doomed from its inception. Its apparent failure should be taken<br />\nas an object lesson, showing the necessity of<br />\ngreater consultation and participation of<br />\nundergraduates where their interests are<br />\ndirectly concerned. The only way in which<br />\nsome semblance of democracy can be<br />\nsalvaged is by conducting a referendum in<br />\nwhich undergraduates may approve or veto<br />\nthe choice of the committee.<br /><br />\nApril 16, 1971<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nJR=<br />\nCity Chevrolet: Dinah Shore WalWrong<br />\nBy TED ROHRLICH<br />\nNew car dealerships.. plush<br />\nshowrooms, courteous salesmen,<br />\nopulence in a poor neighborhood.<br />\nBut you only see that once.<br />\nThe next time and the next time<br />\nand the time after that you see the<br />\nservice department, where all of a<br />\nsudden the fact that you laid down<br />\ntwo or three thousand for a car<br />\ndoesn't mean shit.<br />\nWhat means shit is that you're<br />\nthere, your car's sitting apart in<br />\nthe shop, you don't know the first<br />\nthing about what's wrong and<br />\nthey've got you for whatever price<br />\nstrikes their fancy.<br />\nYou complain--with visions of<br />\nRalph Nader dancing in your head,<br />\nsugarplums and all.<br />\nTry it sometime. Here's what<br />\nhappens.<br />\nThe place for me was City<br />\nChevrolet at 24th and Howard.<br />\nNone of the names have been<br />\nchanged for fear of protecting the<br />\nguilty.<br />\nThere were three of us in the<br />\nservice manager's office: the man<br />\nhimself, Al Zuk, the company<br />\ntreasurer Walter Helwig (the<br />\npresident was in Paris), and me.<br />\nThere was a slight difference of<br />\nopinion.<br />\nI had brought my car in for<br />\nservice three weeks before. The<br />\ncar was losing power and riding<br /><br />\nrocky. The problem was analyzed<br />\nand the solution termed a valve<br />\njob, which was performed after two<br />\nweeks of exhiliarating dialogue<br />\nlike:<br />\n\"I think this is under warranty.\"<br />\n\"No it's not.\"<br />\nFinally, when my options were<br />\nexhausted. I gave in and told them<br />\nto go ahead and fix the car, which<br />\nthey did, one week and $188 later.<br />\nThis is the story of those options<br />\nand how, one Friday afternoon<br />\nwhen all was right with the world,<br />\nbut not my car, I discovered that I<br />\nhad indeed been ripped off. You<br />\nsee, not only was the warranty<br />\nquestion resolved in their favor, but<br />\nthe car still wouldn't run. It wasn't<br />\nthe valves after all, it was the<br />\nclutch, which went out completely<br />\nten miles after I pulled out of City<br />\nChevrolet. That's how I wound up<br />\nin the service manager's office-after stopping payment on my<br />\ncheck. But back to the options:<br />\nOn March 22 I took my car to City<br />\nChevrolet, told the service lane<br />\nattendant the problem and asked<br />\nhim to fix the car. That afternoon<br />\nhe called me to come down and<br />\ntake a look as I'd requested. He told<br />\nme that my valves were sticking<br />\nbecause of an awful case of carbon<br />\naccumulation. Not knowing how<br />\nmuch carbon is normal, I accepted<br /><br />\nhis word for it.<br />\nI asked him what causes such a<br />\nproblem and he answered \"General<br />\ndriving conditions.\" He said there<br />\nwas no defect in parts.<br />\nNow, I don't know much about<br />\ncars, but this seemed suspect. The<br />\ncar had been driven normally, not<br />\nabusively, for a little over 32,000<br />\nmiles.<br />\nSo I asked him how to get a<br />\nfactory representative to come<br />\ndown and decide the warranty<br />\nquestion. He told me that I would<br />\nhave to call him myself.<br />\nI called Frank Fields in customer<br />\nrelations at the Chevrolet zone<br />\noffice and he told me that I could<br />\nnot request a factory representative, that the request had to be<br />\nmade by the service manager, Al<br />\nZuk.<br />\nSo I talked to Zuk who tried to<br />\nconvince me that the item in<br />\nquestion was not covered by my<br />\nwarranty, but was due to \"general<br />\ndriving conditions.\"<br />\nI asked him for about the fourth<br />\ntime to call back Fields and each<br />\ntime he said that I had to call<br />\nFields, not he. Each time I explained that Fields had told me that<br />\nZuk had to call him. Finally I<br />\npersuaded Zuk to call. After a<br />\nprolonged discussion Zuk hung<br />\nup, told me that Fields agreed with<br /><br />\nhim, and said I would have to call<br />\nFields myself.<br />\nI made a comment about \"runarounds\" and Zuk told me that this<br />\nwas standard procedure, that<br />\nChevrolet doesn't send a factory<br />\nrepresentative every time someone<br />\nrequests one. It seems you have to<br />\nprove that you're serious by<br />\nrequesting one several times.<br />\nThis wouldn't be too bad except<br />\nfor the fact that there's an average<br />\nfifteen minute waiting time to get<br />\nFields on the phone.<br />\nI made the ten-minute walk back<br />\nto campus and called Fields immediately. He had gone for the day.<br />\nThe next morning I called Fields<br />\nbright and early, waited my fifteen<br />\nminutes and went through my<br />\nwhole story again. He went through<br />\nhis whole story again. I started to<br />\nget mad.<br />\nFinally, he promised to send a<br />\nfactory representative to look at<br />\nthe car sometime late in the<br />\nfollowing week. He explained that<br />\nthere were only two persons who<br />\ntravelled around to dealerships<br />\n(Later I found out , there were<br />\ntwelve.) and none would be<br />\navailable before that time. I said<br />\nfine and that seemed to surprise<br />\nhim.<br />\n(continued On pap. 8)<br /><br />\nflowers<br /><br />\nmelvin hecht<br /><br />\nApril 16, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\n`Cherrydrops'freshman folk opera<br />\nBy JOHN CAMPION<br />\nA new type of folk opera was<br />\nrecently composed by two Hopkins<br />\nfreshmen, Mitchel Clarvit and<br />\nbennis Perman, as a joint<br />\nminimester project for writing<br />\nseminars.<br />\n\"Cherrydrops\" isn't a rock or a<br />\nclassical opera, it's our story with<br />\nour music. Don't compare it with<br />\nrock,\" said composer Perman.<br />\nThe opera developed from music<br />\nClarvit was composing in the<br />\nsummer of 1970.

But like other<br />\nmore to<br />\noperas, there's<br />\nCherrydrops than a simplistic story<br />\nline. The real strength of the opera<br />\nis, in fact, in the music, with many<br />\nof the movements being instrumentals.<br />\n\"This is transfer of emotion<br />\nmusic,\" said Clarvit. \"The music<br />\nitself creates a mood.\"<br />\nPerman expressed a sense of<br />\naccomplishment in composing<br />\nCherrydrops. \"I felt a realization of<br />\nthe ability to write a unified work<br />\nwhich can affect others the way it<br />\naffects me.

In the event<br />\nyou can't find the baby's formula, let it suck your wrist. It will never<br />\nknow the difTerence, for the baby is basically an organism of dim intelligence, though not without,a certain peasant Cunning.<br />\nAfter the baby has ingested the formula cr sucked your wrist for<br />\nthirty minutes or so, it. grows stuporous and is ready to go to sleep\u2014the<br />\nvery thing you've been waiting for. You can lusten this desirable condition by singing a lullaby. If you don't know any lullabies, make one<br />\nup. This is really quite simple. In a lullaby the words are unimportant<br />\nsince the baby, basically an organism of dim intelligence as we have<br />\nseen, does not understand them anyhow. It is the sound which matters<br />\nin a lullaby, so use any old thing that comes into your head, just so it<br />\nrhymes. For example, I have always had excellent luck with this one:<br />\nGo to sleep, my little infant,<br />\nGoogoo, moomoo, poopoo, k nfont.<br /><br />\nNext, arrange the baby in the position for slumber. A baby sleeps<br />\nbest on its stomach but, owing to its dim intelligence, it will keep turning itself over if not prevented. Therefore, to insure that it remains<br />\nprone, it is wise to place a soft, heavy object on its back\u2014another<br />\nbaby, if possible.<br />\nOnce the baby is asleep, remove your wrist from its mouth and<br />\ntiptoe softly from the room, closing the door tightly behind you so you<br />\nwill not be disturbed by its crying.

LENROW<br />\nThere are times of special<br />\ndelight in every sport that<br />\nshow how the human efforts<br />\nof athletes can be outstanding. There are countless<br />\nstories of how an athlete may<br />\nbe injored and still play.<br />\nThe Baltimore Bullets are<br />\nshowing just how far a team<br />\ncan go when injured. The<br />\nBullets, without their all-star<br />\nforward<br />\nGus<br />\nJohnson,<br />\nwithout super-sub Eddie<br />\nMiles, and without the services of starting guard Kevin<br />\nLoughery blew the New York<br />\nKnicks out of the Civic Center<br />\ntwice.<br />\nThe Knicks came to<br />\nBaltimore last weekend with<br />\na two game to nothing lead in<br />\nthe best-of-seven Eastern<br />\nDivision Championship. They<br />\nreturn to New York tied at<br />\ntwo games apiece.<br />\nThe Bullets, who had been<br />\nwithout Miles and Johnson in<br />\nthe first two games, also lost<br />\nthe services of Loughery, who<br />\nhad injured his heel on<br />\nSunday, while he saw limited<br /><br />\naction Wednesday. The<br />\nBullets were down to eight<br />\nminimum<br />\nplayers, the<br />\nnumber allowed in the<br />\nNational Basketball<br />\nAssociation.<br />\nThe starting lineup contained two players who had<br />\nbeen used solely as substitutes throughout the<br />\nseason. Possibly the Knicks<br />\njust weren't up for the game,<br />\nmaybe Willis Reed's injuries<br />\nwere more serious than<br />\nimagined; these are only<br />\nspeculations.<br />\nThe truth is that the Bullets<br />\nknew that they could not get<br />\ninto foul trouble, they knew<br />\nthey all had to hve good<br />\nnights, and moreover they<br />\nknew that if they lost, they<br />\nwere probably out of the<br />\nplayoffs.<br />\nThe last two years the<br />\nKnicks have played the<br />\nBullets in the playoffs. Two<br />\nyears ago, the Bullets'<br />\n'Cinderella' season when they<br />\njumped from last place to<br />\nfirst place in one season, the<br />\nKnicks destroyed the Bullets<br /><br />\nfour games to none.<br />\nLast year, the Bullets faced<br />\nthe Knicks again in the<br />\nEastern Division Finals. The<br />\nKnicks jumped to a two to<br />\nnothing lead before the<br />\nBullets came alive in the<br />\nthird game. The Bullets then<br />\nforced the Knicks to go to<br />\nseven games before bowing<br />\nout. This year the Bullets<br />\nagain came alive in the third<br />\ngame.<br />\nIt is impossible to speculate<br />\nwhy athletes can sometimes<br />\ncome back from incredible<br />\nodds to do better than anyone<br />\nimagined. One thinks of the<br />\ntime that Johnny Unitas and<br />\nGary Guozzo were injured<br />\nand Tom Matte, the Colt<br />\nhalfback had to quarterback<br />\nin the championships against<br />\nLos Angeles with the plays<br />\nwritten out on his sleeve.
