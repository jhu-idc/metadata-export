Baker, former Mayor<br />\nof Cleveland, who was recently<br />\nnamed Secretary of War by President Wilson, is a graduate of Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nMr. Baker received his A. B. in<br />\n1892, and in 1893 took up postgraduate work at this University.<br />\nWhile an undergraduate he pursued what was then known as<br />\ncourse VI, which dealt exclusively<br />\nwith history and politics. He continued this course in his graduate<br />\nwork during the first term of which<br />\nhe took the following subjects:<br />\nSources of English History and<br />\nHistorical Jurisprudence, Dr. Emmott; Germanic History and Historical Seminary, Dr. H. B. Adams.<br />\nIn his second term he resumed<br />\nwork in the last three courses mentioned above and took, in addition,<br />\nAmerican Constitutional Law, Dr.<br />\nSchouler ; Money and Banking,<br />\nDr. Sherwood, and Administration,<br />\nProf. Woodrow Wilson. He was<br />\nnot only a close friend of Mr. Wilson at the time when the latter was<br />\nIlls instructor, but has been on intimate terms with the President<br />\never since.<br />\nOn President Wilson's recent<br />\ntour of the middle West he saw<br />\nMr. Baker in Cleveland and had a<br />\nlong talk with him. Mr. Baker is<br />\nunderstood to be in thorough accord with the President on his<br />\npreparedness program and on his<br />\nattitude in regard to questions of<br />\nforeign policy.<br />\nMr. Baker is 44 years old. He<br />\nwas born in Martinsburg, West<br />\nVirginia, and at the age of 25 was<br />\nappointed private secretary to<br />\nPostmaster General Wilson in<br />\nPresident Cleveland's cabinet. In<br />\n1897, just four years after leaving<br />\nHopkins, he began to practice law<br />\nin Martinsburg. Not long thereafter he moved to Cleveland where<br />\nhe distinguished himself as a party<br />\nleader under Tom L. Johnson'.<br />\nMr. Baker conceived the idea of<br />\nhome rule for Ohio citizens and<br />\nled in the agitation for the new<br />\nOhio constitution, which resulted<br />\nin giving to cities the right to frame<br />\ntheir own charters. He led the<br />\nefforts which resulted in the new<br />\nCleveland charter, in which preferential voting is one of the most<br />\nimportant features.<br />\nFor years Mr. Baker has been<br />\nknown as a leader of the Ohio bar,<br />\nand he is highly regarded by the<br />\nPresident as a lawyer. Mr. Wilson<br />\nWanted the vacant cabinet place<br />\nfilled by a man well versed in law,<br />\nbecause the legal questions con-<br />\n<br />\nThe past two weeks have brought<br />\nlittle change for the better in the<br />\nsituation at Annapolis as regards<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. The bill<br />\nintroduced in the Legislature to stop<br />\nthe annual appropriation of $50,003<br />\nto this University has been reported<br />\nfavorably upon by the committee<br />\nand it is predicted, in all probability,<br />\nwill be passed as soon as the Prohibition Act, now under consideration, has been finally disposed of in<br />\nboth Houses.<br />\nIt has been pointed out to the<br />\nLegislature that the money Hopkins<br />\nusually receives would be necessary, even if the University were<br />\nnot to move to Homewood next fall.<br />\nOnly 20 per cent. of the University's expenses are covered by the<br />\ntuition fees, and there is no large<br />\nendowment held here, such as exists in other colleges. The University needs funds for its regular<br />\nupkeep; even now much of the<br />\nequipment for research work, especially in the chemistry department,<br />\nis inadequate; and, although it is<br />\nnot indispensable, the purchase of<br />\nsome new equipment is considered<br />\nhighly desirable.<br />\nThe money given to Hopkins, it<br />\nhas been shown, would be used almost entirely for the benefit of citizens of Maryland, since 94 per cent.<br />\nof the undergraduate _students taking scientific and academic courses<br />\nhere, and 98 per cent, of the students in engineering, are from this<br />\nState.<br />\nDr. Goodnow is in a very peculiar position\u2014as chairman of the<br />\ncommittee to secure economy and<br />\nefficiency in disposing of the State's<br />\nfunds on the one hand and as president of Hopkins on the other. He<br />\nmust ask for money for the University on the ground that it is<br />\nnecessary for the great educational<br />\ninstitution of Maryland, and oppose<br />\nthe giving of it from the standpoint<br />\nof economy. Dr. Goodnow has<br />\nhandled the situation with such tact<br />\nand skill that he has won the confidence and applause of the entire<br />\nbody of delegates at Annapolis. But<br />\nwhether his appeal before that body<br />\nwill have the desired effect is regarded at Annapolis as extremely<br />\ndoubtful.<br />\nstantly arising in the administration<br />\nof the War Department, the Phillipines, the Panama Canal and<br />\nPorto Rico.<br />\nBesides being a graduate of<br />\nJohns Hopkins, Mr. Baker has received_ degrees from Washington<br />\nand Lee University.<br />\n<br />\nIt is now practically certain that<br />\nBilly Sunday will come to Hopkins.<br />\nthe trustees of the University have\u2022<br />\ngranted the Young Men's Christian<br />\nAssociation the use of McCoy Hail<br />\nfor one day, probably next Monday, at which time the Young Men's<br />\nChr:stian Association may hold any<br />\nmeet'ng they desire, upon their own<br />\nresponsibility and under their own<br />\ndirection.<br />\nIt only remains to receive Mr.<br />\nSunday's formal acceptance of the<br />\ninvitation to speak at the University, and no delay is expected from<br />\nthat source, since it is understood<br />\non very good authority that the<br />\nevangelist is anxious for an opportunity to address the Hopkins students.<br />\nIn order to keep otusiders away,<br />\nit is extremely likely that admission to McCoy Hall will be by<br />\nticket only on the day that Mr. Sunday speaks. A definite announcement concerning thi\u00a7, however, will<br />\nbe made by the Young Men's Christian Association within the next<br />\nfew days.<br />\nThe occasion is being looked forward to with interest, not only by<br />\nHopkins students, but also by the<br />\ngeneral public, which is anxious to<br />\nsee what form this particular address of the noted evangelist will<br />\ntake.<br />\n<br />\nThe sales-check contest nowbe<br />\ning conducted by THE NEws-LET<br />\nTER has but five more days in whicli<br />\nto run.<br />\nAt 12 o'clock Saturday, the 18th,<br />\nthe contest will be closed.

A prize will be awarded to every person who hands in<br />\nchecks for fifteen dollars or over.<br />\nThe only condition of the contest<br />\nis that all checks must date from<br />\nOctober 15, 1915.

Kirk and Nicholson,<br />\nBlack and Blue representatives in<br />\nthe relay, too-yard dash and 220yard swim, were prevented from<br />\nparticipating by sickness and examinations. Minus the services of<br />\nthese men and with a lack of recent practice, the Hopkins men<br />\nshowed nothing like the form which<br />\nhas characterized their Nvork earlier<br />\nin the season. The Poly boys presented a well-rounded team, but<br />\nwith all their men in coadition, the<br />\nUniversity squad would probably<br />\nhave experienced but little trouble<br />\nia coming out on top<br />\nThe first event on the program,<br />\nthe 200-yard relay, found Poly<br />\nwinning by two yards. In this<br />\nevent Hopkins swam only two<br />\nregulars, Marshall being detained<br />\nin laboratory until too late to participate.

The time for<br />\nthis event was within two-fifths<br />\nof a second of the pool record.<br />\nMcCormick won another place for<br />\nHopkins by placing first in the 220yard swim, the time being exceptionally fast. Carrigan, of Poly,<br />\nsprang a surprise by beating out<br />\nGinsberg in the 50-yard breast<br />\nstroke, with Primrose, of Hopkins,<br />\nthird. The last event, the 50-yard<br />\ndash, was marred by poor work on<br />\nthe part of the starter, who, after<br />\nfiring his gun twice, let the race<br />\ngo on. Rowland and Marshall,<br />\nthinking the start a false one, were<br />\nleft half a lap behind before they<br />\nwere aware that the start had been<br />\nallowed. The summary:<br />\n<br />\nThe sixth annual 'session of the<br />\nsummer courses of the University<br />\nwill begin on Wednesday, ,July 5,<br />\nand will continue until. Tuesday,<br />\nAugust 15, inclusive. These courses<br />\n'ill be the last classes to be held at<br />\nthe present site.<br />\nThe number of attendants at the<br />\nsummer school has been rapidly increasing since its foundation and a<br />\nrecord number is expected at this<br />\ncoming session. The plans for the<br />\ncourses, as drawn up by the director, Dr. Buchner, have not as<br />\nyet been formally approved by the<br />\nfaculty and Board of Trustees, but<br />\nit is expected that they will include<br />\nall the courses offered in the past,<br />\nand probably some additional ones.<br />\nSome of ..these courses will be offered to meet the needs of collegi\u2022ate and graduate students who wish<br />\nto advance their standing or to<br />\nmake up deficiencies; others, to enable students, who have not done<br />\nso, to matriculate.<br />\nFor the satisfactory completion<br />\nof the work of any course of collegiate grade, a credit of not More<br />\nthan one-half a regular course will.<br />\nbe allowed. Likewise, the requirements of one of the two years' work<br />\nnecessary for the degree of bachelor of arts may be met by attendance and study in three sessions of<br />\nthe summer school. Students who<br />\nhave just graduated in June and<br />\nwho desire to take up graduate<br />\nwork, may do so immediately at<br />\nthis coming summer school, and receive credit for it.<br />\nThe fact that the University, as<br />\na whole, is moving to Homewood<br />\nwill not interfere in the least with<br />\nthe summer school, as Such. parts<br />\nof the library, apparatus and laboratory equipment necessary will<br />\nbe kept back until the close of the<br />\ncession.<br />\n<br />\nThe staff of the 1917 Hullabaloo<br />\nis already formulating its plans.<br />\nBecause of the excellent work done<br />\nby the White Studio for this year's<br />\nHullabaloo, the business management has decided to have it take<br />\ncharge of the photographic work,<br />\nfor the 1917 Hullabaloo also. Like-,<br />\nwise, the policy of putting the advertising in the hands of a professional will be followed next<br />\nyear, the experience of the present<br />\nstaff proving that many more advertisements can be obtained by this<br />\nmeans than by the more uncertain<br />\nmethod of indiscriminate commission which has formerly been used.<br />\nThe staff of the 1917 Hullabaloo<br />\nis composed of J.

By this system, it was<br />\npossible for the students to have<br />\ntwo, or at least one of their examinations out of the way by the weekend, and for that time to be devoted<br />\nto the preparation of the subjects<br />\nstill to come. This entire system<br />\nwas based on the supposition that<br />\nthe examinations would be immediately followed by a vacation, either<br />\nthe Christmas of Easter holidays,<br />\nor the summer recess itself.<br />\nWith the recent determination by<br />\nthe faculty, however, that, beginning<br />\nnext year, there were to be but two<br />\nsets of examinations,instead of three,<br />\nthe holiday immediately following<br />\nformer examinations had to be left<br />\nout of consideration, and as the faculty deemed it highly inexpeditious to<br />\ndecree an extra week of recess after<br />\nthe midyear examinations, with the<br />\nEaster holidays but a month away,<br />\nit became a question of arranging<br />\nthe schedule of examinations so as<br />\nto put the students under as little<br />\nstrain as possible, that the work of<br />\nthe next term might be taken up<br />\nwithout interruption.<br />\nThe present examinations occupy<br />\na peculiar position. They are given<br />\nunder the past system, in which<br />\nthree examinations a year were held,<br />\nand yet, in form, they..are exactly<br />\nlike those which will be held under<br />\nthe coming semester plan.<br />\nThe schedule for. this week has<br />\nben skillfully arranged. Nearly<br />\nevery undergraduate student has at<br />\nleast one examination on Monday<br />\nand Wednesday, and, at the same<br />\ntime, nearly every one has Tuesday<br />\nfree. By this system, it is possible<br />\nto prepare for the Monday examinations during the week-end, and<br />\nthen to use the intervening day in<br />\nwork upon the remaining subjects.<br />\nIn most of the larger colleges in<br />\nwhich the semester system prevails,<br />\nthe undergraduate students have<br />\nfrom one to three weeks' holiday<br />\nat examinations. This is not because of any university regulation,<br />\nhowever, but merely because the enrollment of the institution is so<br />\nlarge that it is imperative for the<br />\nvarious examinations to be spread<br />\nout over several weeks, so as to<br />\navoid conflict. In this manner, each<br />\ngroup of students is able to take<br />\nits particular examinations within<br />\nfour or five days, and then to have<br />\nthe rest of the period to itself.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hon. James AI .

I am at a disadvantage<br />\ntonight, for after you have imbibed<br />\nthe fiery rhetoric of Sunday, my<br />\nstory will seem truly prosaic.\" Recalling his speech of some months<br />\nago at the Lyric on preparedness,<br />\nMr. Beck reminded his audience<br />\nof the remark he made at that time<br />\nof the ignorance of most Americans of the finer points of their<br />\ncountry's history. More of our<br />\npeople, he said, have read \"The<br />\nFrench Revolution\" of Carlyle than<br />\nhave read the works of Parkman ;<br />\nmore have studied Green's History<br />\nthan have known of the equally<br />\nmonumental work of McMasters.<br />\nIt is for this reason that we fail to<br />\nrealize that \"the American Revolution was an act of sublime audacity.\" One computation has it<br />\nthat in 1776 only about one-third<br />\nof the American people were supporting the war, and that at least<br />\nanother third were ardent Tories.<br />\nAt the time there were almost no<br />\nmanufactories in the Colonies, but<br />\none arms factory and not a single<br />\npowder mill. \"The war began in<br />\na struggle for powder, and almost<br />\nended in one.\" The Battle of Lexington grew out of the desire for<br />\nammunition ; because of the lack of<br />\nit Bunker Hill was lost, and even<br />\nso sagacious a statesman as Dr.<br />\nFranklin suggested that the Continental Army might need to use<br />\nbows and arrows.<br />\nMr. Beck then made a somewhat<br />\nlengthy digression, tracing the<br />\ngrowth of the French courts and<br />\ntheir contests with the monarchy,<br />\nand relating how Pierre Caron, the<br />\nroyal watchmaker, became involved<br />\nin the struggle, to the advantage of<br />\ndemocracy in both France and the<br />\nUnited States. It was while in the<br />\ntoils of the corrupt court, that Caron, better known as Beaumarchais,<br />\npublished four \"Memoires,\" which<br />\nNapoleon said were the beginning<br />\nof the French Revolution.

In making<br />\nthis score the Hopkins team shot<br />\nhigher than any of the other clubs<br />\nin the National Rifle Association<br />\nfor that week, and moreover, defeated a team which has always<br />\nstood near the top of the league.<br />\nIn this match our team showed<br />\nits usual steady and consistent<br />\nshooting..

The shelving in the<br />\nreading-room is to be placed in the<br />\noffices of the members of the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nThe general plan of the removal<br />\nof the library is for boxes just as<br />\nlong as the shelves in the present<br />\nreading-room to be constructed,<br />\nand for the entire shelves of books<br />\nto be conveyed to Homewood intact.

Baker, former Mayor<br />\nof Cleveland, who was recently<br />\nnamed Secretary of War by President Wilson, is a graduate of Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nMr. Baker received his A. B. in<br />\n1892, and in 1893 took up postgraduate work at this University.<br />\nWhile an undergraduate he pursued what was then known as<br />\ncourse VI, which dealt exclusively<br />\nwith history and politics. He continued this course in his graduate<br />\nwork during the first term of which<br />\nhe took the following subjects:<br />\nSources of English History and<br />\nHistorical Jurisprudence, Dr. Emmott; Germanic History and Historical Seminary, Dr. H. B. Adams.<br />\nIn his second term he resumed<br />\nwork in the last three courses mentioned above and took, in addition,<br />\nAmerican Constitutional Law, Dr.<br />\nSchouler ; Money and Banking,<br />\nDr. Sherwood, and Administration,<br />\nProf. Woodrow Wilson. He was<br />\nnot only a close friend of Mr. Wilson at the time when the latter was<br />\nIlls instructor, but has been on intimate terms with the President<br />\never since.<br />\nOn President Wilson's recent<br />\ntour of the middle West he saw<br />\nMr. Baker in Cleveland and had a<br />\nlong talk with him. Mr. Baker is<br />\nunderstood to be in thorough accord with the President on his<br />\npreparedness program and on his<br />\nattitude in regard to questions of<br />\nforeign policy.<br />\nMr. Baker is 44 years old. He<br />\nwas born in Martinsburg, West<br />\nVirginia, and at the age of 25 was<br />\nappointed private secretary to<br />\nPostmaster General Wilson in<br />\nPresident Cleveland's cabinet. In<br />\n1897, just four years after leaving<br />\nHopkins, he began to practice law<br />\nin Martinsburg. Not long thereafter he moved to Cleveland where<br />\nhe distinguished himself as a party<br />\nleader under Tom L. Johnson'.<br />\nMr. Baker conceived the idea of<br />\nhome rule for Ohio citizens and<br />\nled in the agitation for the new<br />\nOhio constitution, which resulted<br />\nin giving to cities the right to frame<br />\ntheir own charters. He led the<br />\nefforts which resulted in the new<br />\nCleveland charter, in which preferential voting is one of the most<br />\nimportant features.<br />\nFor years Mr. Baker has been<br />\nknown as a leader of the Ohio bar,<br />\nand he is highly regarded by the<br />\nPresident as a lawyer. Mr. Wilson<br />\nWanted the vacant cabinet place<br />\nfilled by a man well versed in law,<br />\nbecause the legal questions con-<br /><br />\nThe past two weeks have brought<br />\nlittle change for the better in the<br />\nsituation at Annapolis as regards<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. The bill<br />\nintroduced in the Legislature to stop<br />\nthe annual appropriation of $50,003<br />\nto this University has been reported<br />\nfavorably upon by the committee<br />\nand it is predicted, in all probability,<br />\nwill be passed as soon as the Prohibition Act, now under consideration, has been finally disposed of in<br />\nboth Houses.<br />\nIt has been pointed out to the<br />\nLegislature that the money Hopkins<br />\nusually receives would be necessary, even if the University were<br />\nnot to move to Homewood next fall.<br />\nOnly 20 per cent. of the University's expenses are covered by the<br />\ntuition fees, and there is no large<br />\nendowment held here, such as exists in other colleges. The University needs funds for its regular<br />\nupkeep; even now much of the<br />\nequipment for research work, especially in the chemistry department,<br />\nis inadequate; and, although it is<br />\nnot indispensable, the purchase of<br />\nsome new equipment is considered<br />\nhighly desirable.<br />\nThe money given to Hopkins, it<br />\nhas been shown, would be used almost entirely for the benefit of citizens of Maryland, since 94 per cent.<br />\nof the undergraduate _students taking scientific and academic courses<br />\nhere, and 98 per cent, of the students in engineering, are from this<br />\nState.<br />\nDr. Goodnow is in a very peculiar position\u2014as chairman of the<br />\ncommittee to secure economy and<br />\nefficiency in disposing of the State's<br />\nfunds on the one hand and as president of Hopkins on the other. He<br />\nmust ask for money for the University on the ground that it is<br />\nnecessary for the great educational<br />\ninstitution of Maryland, and oppose<br />\nthe giving of it from the standpoint<br />\nof economy. Dr. Goodnow has<br />\nhandled the situation with such tact<br />\nand skill that he has won the confidence and applause of the entire<br />\nbody of delegates at Annapolis. But<br />\nwhether his appeal before that body<br />\nwill have the desired effect is regarded at Annapolis as extremely<br />\ndoubtful.<br />\nstantly arising in the administration<br />\nof the War Department, the Phillipines, the Panama Canal and<br />\nPorto Rico.<br />\nBesides being a graduate of<br />\nJohns Hopkins, Mr. Baker has received_ degrees from Washington<br />\nand Lee University.<br /><br />\nIt is now practically certain that<br />\nBilly Sunday will come to Hopkins.<br />\nthe trustees of the University have\u2022<br />\ngranted the Young Men's Christian<br />\nAssociation the use of McCoy Hail<br />\nfor one day, probably next Monday, at which time the Young Men's<br />\nChr:stian Association may hold any<br />\nmeet'ng they desire, upon their own<br />\nresponsibility and under their own<br />\ndirection.<br />\nIt only remains to receive Mr.<br />\nSunday's formal acceptance of the<br />\ninvitation to speak at the University, and no delay is expected from<br />\nthat source, since it is understood<br />\non very good authority that the<br />\nevangelist is anxious for an opportunity to address the Hopkins students.<br />\nIn order to keep otusiders away,<br />\nit is extremely likely that admission to McCoy Hall will be by<br />\nticket only on the day that Mr. Sunday speaks. A definite announcement concerning thi\u00a7, however, will<br />\nbe made by the Young Men's Christian Association within the next<br />\nfew days.<br />\nThe occasion is being looked forward to with interest, not only by<br />\nHopkins students, but also by the<br />\ngeneral public, which is anxious to<br />\nsee what form this particular address of the noted evangelist will<br />\ntake.<br /><br />\nThe sales-check contest nowbe<br />\ning conducted by THE NEws-LET<br />\nTER has but five more days in whicli<br />\nto run.<br />\nAt 12 o'clock Saturday, the 18th,<br />\nthe contest will be closed.

Kirk and Nicholson,<br />\nBlack and Blue representatives in<br />\nthe relay, too-yard dash and 220yard swim, were prevented from<br />\nparticipating by sickness and examinations. Minus the services of<br />\nthese men and with a lack of recent practice, the Hopkins men<br />\nshowed nothing like the form which<br />\nhas characterized their Nvork earlier<br />\nin the season. The Poly boys presented a well-rounded team, but<br />\nwith all their men in coadition, the<br />\nUniversity squad would probably<br />\nhave experienced but little trouble<br />\nia coming out on top<br />\nThe first event on the program,<br />\nthe 200-yard relay, found Poly<br />\nwinning by two yards. In this<br />\nevent Hopkins swam only two<br />\nregulars, Marshall being detained<br />\nin laboratory until too late to participate. Hoffman and Fenniman,<br />\nas usual, annexed first for Hopkins<br />\nin the fancy diving and plunge for<br />\ndistance respectively.<br />\nIn the next event, the too-yard<br />\ndash, Rowland swam a beautiful<br />\nrace, just nosing out Lamdin of<br />\nPolytechnic for first. The time for<br />\nthis event was within two-fifths<br />\nof a second of the pool record.<br />\nMcCormick won another place for<br />\nHopkins by placing first in the 220yard swim, the time being exceptionally fast. Carrigan, of Poly,<br />\nsprang a surprise by beating out<br />\nGinsberg in the 50-yard breast<br />\nstroke, with Primrose, of Hopkins,<br />\nthird. The last event, the 50-yard<br />\ndash, was marred by poor work on<br />\nthe part of the starter, who, after<br />\nfiring his gun twice, let the race<br />\ngo on. Rowland and Marshall,<br />\nthinking the start a false one, were<br />\nleft half a lap behind before they<br />\nwere aware that the start had been<br />\nallowed. The summary:<br /><br />\nThe sixth annual 'session of the<br />\nsummer courses of the University<br />\nwill begin on Wednesday, ,July 5,<br />\nand will continue until. Tuesday,<br />\nAugust 15, inclusive. These courses<br />\n'ill be the last classes to be held at<br />\nthe present site.<br />\nThe number of attendants at the<br />\nsummer school has been rapidly increasing since its foundation and a<br />\nrecord number is expected at this<br />\ncoming session. The plans for the<br />\ncourses, as drawn up by the director, Dr. Buchner, have not as<br />\nyet been formally approved by the<br />\nfaculty and Board of Trustees, but<br />\nit is expected that they will include<br />\nall the courses offered in the past,<br />\nand probably some additional ones.<br />\nSome of ..these courses will be offered to meet the needs of collegi\u2022ate and graduate students who wish<br />\nto advance their standing or to<br />\nmake up deficiencies; others, to enable students, who have not done<br />\nso, to matriculate.<br />\nFor the satisfactory completion<br />\nof the work of any course of collegiate grade, a credit of not More<br />\nthan one-half a regular course will.<br />\nbe allowed. Likewise, the requirements of one of the two years' work<br />\nnecessary for the degree of bachelor of arts may be met by attendance and study in three sessions of<br />\nthe summer school. Students who<br />\nhave just graduated in June and<br />\nwho desire to take up graduate<br />\nwork, may do so immediately at<br />\nthis coming summer school, and receive credit for it.<br />\nThe fact that the University, as<br />\na whole, is moving to Homewood<br />\nwill not interfere in the least with<br />\nthe summer school, as Such. parts<br />\nof the library, apparatus and laboratory equipment necessary will<br />\nbe kept back until the close of the<br />\ncession.<br /><br />\nThe staff of the 1917 Hullabaloo<br />\nis already formulating its plans.<br />\nBecause of the excellent work done<br />\nby the White Studio for this year's<br />\nHullabaloo, the business management has decided to have it take<br />\ncharge of the photographic work,<br />\nfor the 1917 Hullabaloo also. Like-,<br />\nwise, the policy of putting the advertising in the hands of a professional will be followed next<br />\nyear, the experience of the present<br />\nstaff proving that many more advertisements can be obtained by this<br />\nmeans than by the more uncertain<br />\nmethod of indiscriminate commission which has formerly been used.<br />\nThe staff of the 1917 Hullabaloo<br />\nis composed of J.

Indeed, no fruits of Johns<br />\nHopkins scholarship is more unexpected than a book of poems. Yet<br />\nsuch a book has recently appeared<br />\n\"Selected Poems,\" by Aaron<br />\nSchaffer, '14, published by the Poet<br />\nLore Company, of Boston.<br />\nMr. Schaffer's book is a slender<br />\nvolume of thirty odd lyrics and brief<br />\nnarrative poems. They are a young<br />\nman's poems\u2014some of them distinctly reminiscent of studies as an<br />\nundergraduate\u2014all tinged with the<br />\nreligious fervor of youth and<br />\nbreathing a high devotion to the<br />\nfaith and the ideals of Judaism. A<br />\nfew grow out of reflections on the<br />\nwar and its horrors.<br />\nThe author's mood is thoughtful<br />\n\u2014often sombre\u2014and the lyrics,<br />\nthough wholly sincere; lack somewhat the lightness and melody of<br />\nsongs that must be sung, because<br />\nthe numbers come. They sometimes, indeed, have a satanic note.<br />\nSo in \"Contrasts,\" in which he<br />\nturns from a Browning lecture,<br />\nwhich people praised without comprehending, to a prize-fight, which<br />\nwas understood only too well, the<br />\npoet is left discouraged and uncertain:<br />\nSince 'then I'm in doullt as to which<br />\nway is proper,<br />\nThe way of false gold or the way of<br />\npure copper.<br /><br />\nOur resentment of the lassitude<br />\nof the first warm day in spring, the<br />\npoet blames as follows:<br />\nMankind's a fickle wanton,<br />\nNe'er satisfied nor pleased;<br />\nHe scolds and fumes at April showers,<br />\nYet by her sun, which loves the flowers,<br />\nHe cannot be appeased.<br /><br />\nThe religious sentiment of the<br />\nPoems is frank and genuine.

CHARLES ST.<br /><br />\nFuture Examinations All to Begin on<br />\nMonday -First Time for Many Years<br />\nExercises Not Followed<br />\nby Recess.<br /><br />\nDr.Beck Recalls Aid Furnished by France<br />\nto this Country During Revolution,<br />\nand Asks for Help for Sufferers of Present War.<br /><br />\nThe undergraduate examinations,<br />\nwhich are being held this week,<br />\nare the first of a new system, which<br />\nfrom this time forth will be used<br />\nentirely at Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nFor the last several years, it has<br />\nbeen customary for the undergraduate examinations to begin on Friday<br />\nand then to continue until the Wednesday or Thursday of the following week. By this system, it was<br />\npossible for the students to have<br />\ntwo, or at least one of their examinations out of the way by the weekend, and for that time to be devoted<br />\nto the preparation of the subjects<br />\nstill to come. This entire system<br />\nwas based on the supposition that<br />\nthe examinations would be immediately followed by a vacation, either<br />\nthe Christmas of Easter holidays,<br />\nor the summer recess itself.<br />\nWith the recent determination by<br />\nthe faculty, however, that, beginning<br />\nnext year, there were to be but two<br />\nsets of examinations,instead of three,<br />\nthe holiday immediately following<br />\nformer examinations had to be left<br />\nout of consideration, and as the faculty deemed it highly inexpeditious to<br />\ndecree an extra week of recess after<br />\nthe midyear examinations, with the<br />\nEaster holidays but a month away,<br />\nit became a question of arranging<br />\nthe schedule of examinations so as<br />\nto put the students under as little<br />\nstrain as possible, that the work of<br />\nthe next term might be taken up<br />\nwithout interruption.<br />\nThe present examinations occupy<br />\na peculiar position. They are given<br />\nunder the past system, in which<br />\nthree examinations a year were held,<br />\nand yet, in form, they..are exactly<br />\nlike those which will be held under<br />\nthe coming semester plan.<br />\nThe schedule for. this week has<br />\nben skillfully arranged. Nearly<br />\nevery undergraduate student has at<br />\nleast one examination on Monday<br />\nand Wednesday, and, at the same<br />\ntime, nearly every one has Tuesday<br />\nfree. By this system, it is possible<br />\nto prepare for the Monday examinations during the week-end, and<br />\nthen to use the intervening day in<br />\nwork upon the remaining subjects.<br />\nIn most of the larger colleges in<br />\nwhich the semester system prevails,<br />\nthe undergraduate students have<br />\nfrom one to three weeks' holiday<br />\nat examinations. This is not because of any university regulation,<br />\nhowever, but merely because the enrollment of the institution is so<br />\nlarge that it is imperative for the<br />\nvarious examinations to be spread<br />\nout over several weeks, so as to<br />\navoid conflict. In this manner, each<br />\ngroup of students is able to take<br />\nits particular examinations within<br />\nfour or five days, and then to have<br />\nthe rest of the period to itself.<br /><br />\nThe Hon. James AI . Beck,. who<br />\nwas Assistant Attorney-General under President McKinley, spoke last<br />\nSaturday night in McCoy Hall on<br />\n\"The Lost Million,\" being a presentation of the services rendered<br />\nthis country by France during our<br />\nRevolution, and a plea that we aid<br />\nthe French war sufferers of today.<br />\nThe meeting was held under the<br />\nauspices of the Surgical Dressings<br />\nCommittee. President Frank J.<br />\nGoodnow, of the University, presided and introduced the speaker.<br />\n\"I feel great diffidence,\" Mr.<br />\nBeck said, \"in being called upon<br />\nto address a Baltimore audience in<br />\ncompetition with. the greatest of<br />\nmodern orators \u2014 Rev. William<br />\nSunday. I am at a disadvantage<br />\ntonight, for after you have imbibed<br />\nthe fiery rhetoric of Sunday, my<br />\nstory will seem truly prosaic.\" Recalling his speech of some months<br />\nago at the Lyric on preparedness,<br />\nMr. Beck reminded his audience<br />\nof the remark he made at that time<br />\nof the ignorance of most Americans of the finer points of their<br />\ncountry's history. More of our<br />\npeople, he said, have read \"The<br />\nFrench Revolution\" of Carlyle than<br />\nhave read the works of Parkman ;<br />\nmore have studied Green's History<br />\nthan have known of the equally<br />\nmonumental work of McMasters.<br />\nIt is for this reason that we fail to<br />\nrealize that \"the American Revolution was an act of sublime audacity.\" One computation has it<br />\nthat in 1776 only about one-third<br />\nof the American people were supporting the war, and that at least<br />\nanother third were ardent Tories.<br />\nAt the time there were almost no<br />\nmanufactories in the Colonies, but<br />\none arms factory and not a single<br />\npowder mill. \"The war began in<br />\na struggle for powder, and almost<br />\nended in one.\" The Battle of Lexington grew out of the desire for<br />\nammunition ; because of the lack of<br />\nit Bunker Hill was lost, and even<br />\nso sagacious a statesman as Dr.<br />\nFranklin suggested that the Continental Army might need to use<br />\nbows and arrows.<br />\nMr. Beck then made a somewhat<br />\nlengthy digression, tracing the<br />\ngrowth of the French courts and<br />\ntheir contests with the monarchy,<br />\nand relating how Pierre Caron, the<br />\nroyal watchmaker, became involved<br />\nin the struggle, to the advantage of<br />\ndemocracy in both France and the<br />\nUnited States. It was while in the<br />\ntoils of the corrupt court, that Caron, better known as Beaumarchais,<br />\npublished four \"Memoires,\" which<br />\nNapoleon said were the beginning<br />\nof the French Revolution. At the<br />\nsame time, the \"Barber of Seville\"<br />\nwas written to continue, on the<br />\nstage, his attacks against corrupt<br />\ngovernment.

For all of his service, Beaumarchais received less than thanks;<br />\nhe was not even paid. Till his death<br />\nin 1799, he continued an adventurous life, but the inaction of our<br />\nGovernment gradually pushed him<br />\nto bankruptcy. Hamilton, as Secretary of the Treasury, recognized<br />\nthe claim of his daughter for I,800,000 livres, but no settlement<br />\nwas made until 1835, when Beaumarchais' estate was refunded 8o0,000 livres.

In making<br />\nthis score the Hopkins team shot<br />\nhigher than any of the other clubs<br />\nin the National Rifle Association<br />\nfor that week, and moreover, defeated a team which has always<br />\nstood near the top of the league.<br />\nIn this match our team showed<br />\nits usual steady and consistent<br />\nshooting.. J. M. C. Van Hulstyn<br />\nand P. R. Wiggins each made a<br />\nscore of 198; H. A. Rowland shot<br />\n197; W. B. Pratt shot 196, and J.<br />\nW. Young made 193.<br />\nIn the match against the field,<br />\nwhich occurred on March 1, the<br />\nscore of 982 wfts repeated. H. A.<br />\nRowland and W. B. Pratt headed<br />\nthe list each with 199; Chesholm<br />\nfollowed with 197; Van Hulstyn<br />\nmade 195, and F. Smith shot 192.<br />\nThe scores made against St.<br />\nThomas on March 3 were not as<br />\ngood as these, but since that college is now at the bottom of the<br />\nleague, it is practically certain that<br />\nHopkins, making the score 974,<br />\nwon by a large margin. The results of the match with Lehigh,<br />\nheld on March 1o, are still unknown.<br />\nThe announcement was made<br />\nlast week that each of the members<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nRifle Club will be able to obtain a<br />\nKrag carbine, which cost the United States Government $20, for<br />\n$2.5o, to use in the outdoor practice. The Club offers this as an<br />\nadded inducement to prospective<br />\nmembers, as no one can obtain one<br />\nof these rifles except through the<br />\nNational Rifle Association.<br /><br />\nAll arrangements for the transportation of the library from McCoy Hall to Homewood have been<br />\nmade.

The books<br />\nbelonging to the biological laboratory will be placed in the basement<br />\nof the Academic Building in such<br />\ncases next year, while the geological and chemical libraries will be<br />\ntemporar.ly installed in the big cases<br />\nwhich now stand in the present<br />\nreading-room. The shelving in the<br />\nreading-room is to be placed in the<br />\noffices of the members of the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nThe general plan of the removal<br />\nof the library is for boxes just as<br />\nlong as the shelves in the present<br />\nreading-room to be constructed,<br />\nand for the entire shelves of books<br />\nto be conveyed to Homewood intact. This will avoid all confusion,<br />\nand will be a great help in replacing the books on the shelves in the<br />\nnew library.<br />\nDR.
