And why should it not be familiar? Why, where learning<br />\nis king, where taste is sovereign, where brain power rules<br />\nsupreme,should not Marlboro be everyone's favorite? The same<br />\ngood sense that gets you through an exam in Restoration Poetry<br />\nor solid-state physics certainly does not desert you when you<br />\ncome to pick a cigarette. You look for a flavor that is flavorful,<br />\na filter pure and white, a choice of pack or box, a lot to like. You<br />\nlook,in short,for Marlboro\u2014and happily you don't have to look<br />\nfar. Marlboro is available at your friendly tobacconist's or vending machine, wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states and<br />\nLas Vegas.<br />\nBut I digress.

Until, however, he went into<br />\nresidence at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification, his progress was not what you would call<br />\nrapid. He started well enough with the immortal couplet we all<br />\nknow: They speed along on ,wheels of rubber, rushing home in<br />\ntime for subber .<br />\nThen Mr. Sigafoos got stuck.

Well, the Student<br />\nCouncil has won, overwhelmingly.<br />\nIt is bad enough that the Student Council dampens school<br />\n<br />\nspirit and fails to provide constructive leadership to the undergraduate body, but now it<br />\neven refuses to represent the<br />\nstudents. In a mixture of vague<br />\nlanguage and poor judgment, the<br />\nSC has concocted legislation to<br />\nfuther strengthen the control of<br />\nthe campus by a minority. The<br />\nfourth clause of Article One of<br />\nthe GCC constitution is not in<br />\nany sense of the word a device<br />\nfor the protection of the individual. Rather, it is an instrument to help the SC further intrude into the affairs of students<br />\nand the DSRC.<br />\nThe intent of this clause may.<br />\nunder a certain philosophy, be<br />\nadmirable, but surely its proponents must be joking if they<br />\nthink every aspect of life at Hopkins should be covered by legislation. Agreed that an elastic<br />\nclause can provide the law with<br />\nadded power which may be vital<br />\nunder some circumstances, but<br />\nin the hands of a body which<br />\nemphasizes the system rather<br />\nthan the individual, such a clause<br />\nis as dangerous as the one which<br />\nexempts fraternities but not the<br />\nDSRC from the jurisdiction of<br />\nthis code. In effect, this code<br />\ndoes not provide equal justice for<br />\neither the individual or a particular group of students. I do<br />\nnot propose that the GCC interfere with the IFC: this would<br />\nascribe a lack of responsibility<br />\nto the fraternities. But why<br />\nshould the SC interfere with the<br />\nDSRC? The latter is as much<br />\nentitled to autonomy as the IFC.<br />\nI have an idea why Mr. Abernethy refuses to permit the<br />\n\"eloquence\" of a particular group<br />\nto decide the outcome of this<br />\nidiotic mess, but it does not<br />\nascribe to him the official responsibility which a truly interested president would have. It is<br />\nhigh time that he and his group<br />\ndirect their energies to positive<br />\nactions. The record of the SC itself is the most eloquent plea yet<br />\nfor saving innocent bystanders<br />\nfrom the power-seeking, but irresponsible, campus politicians.<br />\nSince it operates in a vacuum<br />\nanyway, perhaps we should dissolve the Student Council.<br />\nBob Beckman<br />\n<br />\nProblem Solver<br />\n<br />\n\"Tareyton's Dual Filter in duas partes divisa est!\"<br />\nsays Publius (Boom -Boom) Aurelius, Coliseum crowdpleaser.<br />\nSays Boom-Boom,\"Tareyton is one filter cigarette that<br />\nreally delivers de gustibus.

The \"outer-directed individuals\" are characterized by<br />\nFrom the<br />\nEvans as lacking a system of<br />\n\"Cum Londe Collection\"<br />\ncoherent personal values, greatly<br />\nesteeming \"getting along\", and<br />\nTO.11111111111111111111111<br />\nidentifying with and yielding to<br />\n\"the governing of the group and<br />\nstate.\" The consequence, Mr.<br />\nI Evans maintans, is \"a land of<br />\n<br />\n--ARRO<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nSII*40,400:SIM6,!,*.<br />\n<br />\nwhat industry to enter?

The Vertol Division of Boeing<br />\nthe world-famous aerospace company, is regarded as the<br />\nleading designer and manufacturer of helicopters and associated aircraft types. It is the company that has been first<br />\nwith the most in product improvements, and it has both the<br />\nstrength and flexibility to maintain its leadership status.

On the<br />\nother hand, those who are<br />\n\"inner-directed\" not only adhere<br />\nto a strong sense of personal<br />\nvalues but also base their actions<br />\non fundamental moral standards.<br />\nThey have no need to seek the<br />\nshifting criterion of the group.<br />\nRelativistic Breakdown<br />\nBut rather than attack the<br />\n\"success\" ethic attributed to<br />\nAmerican business as chiefly responsible, Evans ascribes the<br />\nbreakdown of moral values to<br />\nthe \"quagmire of relativism\"<br />\nfound on most college campuses.<br />\nAmorality is constantly bandied<br />\nabout and percolates the students with its subtle debilitation.<br />\nPersuasive examples submitted<br />\ninclude the condoning attitude<br />\nof Columbia students of Charles<br />\nVan Doren's role in the quiz<br />\nscandals and a survey conducted<br />\nat Vassar College showing a development of traits from freshman to senior years which indicate a much greater flexibility in<br />\nmatters ranging from \"telling<br />\nthe truth to sexual propriety.\"<br />\nIn short, the stimulating conclusion is that the burden of<br />\nthe well-publicized moral decline<br />\nmight be laid, at least in part,<br />\non our American universities.<br />\nEvans explores a constellation<br />\nof sprouting conservative causes<br />\nwith the verve of an experienced<br />\nreporter. Young Americans for<br />\nFreedom, the Intercollegiate society of Individualists, and purely \"grass roots\" clubs are all<br />\ngiven their fair share of space as<br />\nwell as the conservative action<br />\nagainst the liberal National Student Association, activity at the<br />\n1960 Republican convention, and<br />\nas a Washington political pressure group. He reports that on<br />\nmany campuses initial conservative attempts to establish clubs<br />\nwere pointedly discouraged by<br />\nthe administration. This led<br />\nmany to suspect that the much<br />\nprofessed university tolerance<br />\nextended only to those of the<br />\nleft.<br />\nPermanent Movement<br />\nOverlooking the frankly proselytizing tenor of the book, Evans<br />\nis best in his definition of the<br />\nnew conservatism. Assessing the<br />\nmovement as more than a mere<br />\nswing of the pendulum, he effectively dissects the notion that a<br />\nconservative is a restrainer and<br />\nby nature cannot be a mover.<br />\nAccording to the author, the<br />\nunderpinning of the new move<br />\non the right consists of a \"basic<br />\nview of the condition of man.<br />\nsociety, and the moral order..<br />\nin which respect for the individual is balanced against the limited role of the government surrounded by the laws of the moral<br />\nuniverse.\"<br />\nCertain discrepancies can be<br />\ngleaned from the body of concepts articulated by Stanton<br />\nEvans as they are translated<br />\ninto political action. The new<br />\nconservatives seek to expand<br />\nfreedom from governmental control, yet they readily accede to<br />\nthe wishes or whims of the military. Some desire that United<br />\nStates foreign policy follow a<br />\nstraight line of self-interest,<br />\nwhile others are concerned with<br />\nits relation to moral norms. Although it is too much to expect<br />\na. fully rationalized doctrine.<br />\nEvans pays scant attention to<br />\ndivergencies either m the movement itself or its relation to<br />\nother conservative groups. The<br />\nactivities of the John Birch Society and other extreme groups<br />\nfail to be mentioned, much less<br />\nevaluated.<br />\nAs a chronology of the new<br />\ncampus conservatism. Revolt on<br />\nthe Campus records the genesis<br />\nof the thought as well as the<br />\nmood of the militant assault<br />\nagainst the liberal establishment.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH 9, 1962<br />\n<br />\nPAGE ELEVEN<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nBonfires, Visits From Deans 'Quid Pro Quo'Service<br />\nTo Liven Lauderdale Scene For Scholars On Move<br />\nThis bustling lower Atlantic<br />\ncoast resort city, now the training home of the world champion<br />\nNew York Yankees, is making<br />\nready for the 1962 visitation of<br />\ncollege students in March and<br />\nApril.<br />\nPublic spirited citizens are<br />\nWorking zealously with municipal<br />\nofficials to offer vacationing<br />\nundergraduates an interesting<br />\nand varied recreation and entertainment program.

As the<br />\nStudent Council picks up the pieces, it faces the job of<br />\ndetermining whether the opposition stemmed from disenchantment with the whole idea of a non-academic<br />\njudicial body with the accompanying delineation of<br />\n\"crimes\" and punishments, or simply from dissatisfaction with the hasty and inconsiderate manner in which<br />\nthe constitution was formulated and pushed through.<br />\nCertainly both reasons played important parts in the unceremonious failure.

In fact,<br />\nthe artist-in-residence has become as familiar a sight on campus<br />\nas Latin ponies, leather elbow patches, Rorschach tests, hula<br />\nhoops, and Marlboro cigarettes.<br />\nAnd we all know how familiar that is\u2014I mean Marlboro cigarettes. And why should it not be familiar? Why, where learning<br />\nis king, where taste is sovereign, where brain power rules<br />\nsupreme,should not Marlboro be everyone's favorite? The same<br />\ngood sense that gets you through an exam in Restoration Poetry<br />\nor solid-state physics certainly does not desert you when you<br />\ncome to pick a cigarette. You look for a flavor that is flavorful,<br />\na filter pure and white, a choice of pack or box, a lot to like. You<br />\nlook,in short,for Marlboro\u2014and happily you don't have to look<br />\nfar. Marlboro is available at your friendly tobacconist's or vending machine, wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states and<br />\nLas Vegas.<br />\nBut I digress. We were speaking of the new campus phenomenon\u2014the artist-in-residence--a man or woman who writes,<br />\npaints, or composes right on your very own campus and who is<br />\nalso available for occasional consultations with superior students.<br />\nTake,for example, William Cullen Sigafoos, artist-in-residence<br />\nat the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification.<br />\nAs we all know, Mr.Sigafoos has been working for many years<br />\non an epic poem in rhymed couplets about the opening of the<br />\nYoungstown-Akron highway. Until, however, he went into<br />\nresidence at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification, his progress was not what you would call<br />\nrapid. He started well enough with the immortal couplet we all<br />\nknow: They speed along on ,wheels of rubber, rushing home in<br />\ntime for subber .<br />\nThen Mr. Sigafoos got stuck. It.is not that his muse deserted<br />\nhim; it is that he became involved in a series of time-consuming<br />\nepisodes\u2014a prefrontal lobotomy for Irwin, his faithful sled<br />\ndog; fourteen consecutive months of jury duty on a very complicated case of overtime parking; getting his coattail caught in<br />\nthe door of a jet bound for Brisbane, Australia; stuff like that.<br />\nHe was engaged in a very arduous job in Sandusky\u2014posing<br />\nfor a sculptor of hydrants\u2014when an offer came from the Toledo<br />\nCollege of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification to take<br />\nup residence there, finish his magnum opus and, from time to<br />\ntime, see a few gifted students.<br />\nMr. Sigafoos accepted with pleasure and in three short years<br />\ncompleted the second couplet of his Youngstown-Akron Turnpike<br />\nepic: The highway is made ofsolid concrete and at the toll station you<br />\nyet a receipt.<br /><br />\nKihrrabit<br />\nBy KEN NOBEL<br /><br />\nIn a rare burst of originality<br />\nthe Student Council has taken<br />\nthe lead in the creation of a<br />\nrefreshingly light and comic<br />\natmosphere about the Homewood<br />\nby infusing into its usual functions a form of high comedy<br />\nwhich, when appreciated, can<br />\nonly serve as the finest of outlets for the tensions of life in<br />\nBaltimore in the winter. In short,<br />\nthe council has, to all appearances, given up its questionable<br />\ngovernmental functions and established itself as the campus<br />\njoke. Such an act of altruism is<br />\nnot to be taken lightly; the touch<br />\nof farce and fantasy, thus introduced, could be the very thing<br />\nneeded to dispel the academic<br />\ngloom of Hopkins without destroying its scholarly charm.<br />\nSuch further excursions into<br />\nthe absurd as the recent Gentleman's Code incident would, for<br />\nexample, be most welcome. Perhaps the timing of such humorous endeavors could be improved<br />\nin the future by staging them<br />\nduring mid-terms or final exams<br />\nwhen tension most needs to be<br />\nalleviated, but the general plan<br />\nof the Student Council as a<br /><br />\nAs Seen In<br />\nCollegiate Digest<br /><br />\nJOHN J.

Well, the Student<br />\nCouncil has won, overwhelmingly.<br />\nIt is bad enough that the Student Council dampens school<br /><br />\nspirit and fails to provide constructive leadership to the undergraduate body, but now it<br />\neven refuses to represent the<br />\nstudents. In a mixture of vague<br />\nlanguage and poor judgment, the<br />\nSC has concocted legislation to<br />\nfuther strengthen the control of<br />\nthe campus by a minority. The<br />\nfourth clause of Article One of<br />\nthe GCC constitution is not in<br />\nany sense of the word a device<br />\nfor the protection of the individual. Rather, it is an instrument to help the SC further intrude into the affairs of students<br />\nand the DSRC.<br />\nThe intent of this clause may.<br />\nunder a certain philosophy, be<br />\nadmirable, but surely its proponents must be joking if they<br />\nthink every aspect of life at Hopkins should be covered by legislation. Agreed that an elastic<br />\nclause can provide the law with<br />\nadded power which may be vital<br />\nunder some circumstances, but<br />\nin the hands of a body which<br />\nemphasizes the system rather<br />\nthan the individual, such a clause<br />\nis as dangerous as the one which<br />\nexempts fraternities but not the<br />\nDSRC from the jurisdiction of<br />\nthis code. In effect, this code<br />\ndoes not provide equal justice for<br />\neither the individual or a particular group of students. I do<br />\nnot propose that the GCC interfere with the IFC: this would<br />\nascribe a lack of responsibility<br />\nto the fraternities. But why<br />\nshould the SC interfere with the<br />\nDSRC? The latter is as much<br />\nentitled to autonomy as the IFC.<br />\nI have an idea why Mr. Abernethy refuses to permit the<br />\n\"eloquence\" of a particular group<br />\nto decide the outcome of this<br />\nidiotic mess, but it does not<br />\nascribe to him the official responsibility which a truly interested president would have. It is<br />\nhigh time that he and his group<br />\ndirect their energies to positive<br />\nactions.

The Vertol Division of Boeing<br />\nthe world-famous aerospace company, is regarded as the<br />\nleading designer and manufacturer of helicopters and associated aircraft types. It is the company that has been first<br />\nwith the most in product improvements, and it has both the<br />\nstrength and flexibility to maintain its leadership status.

Young Americans for<br />\nFreedom, the Intercollegiate society of Individualists, and purely \"grass roots\" clubs are all<br />\ngiven their fair share of space as<br />\nwell as the conservative action<br />\nagainst the liberal National Student Association, activity at the<br />\n1960 Republican convention, and<br />\nas a Washington political pressure group. He reports that on<br />\nmany campuses initial conservative attempts to establish clubs<br />\nwere pointedly discouraged by<br />\nthe administration. This led<br />\nmany to suspect that the much<br />\nprofessed university tolerance<br />\nextended only to those of the<br />\nleft.<br />\nPermanent Movement<br />\nOverlooking the frankly proselytizing tenor of the book, Evans<br />\nis best in his definition of the<br />\nnew conservatism. Assessing the<br />\nmovement as more than a mere<br />\nswing of the pendulum, he effectively dissects the notion that a<br />\nconservative is a restrainer and<br />\nby nature cannot be a mover.<br />\nAccording to the author, the<br />\nunderpinning of the new move<br />\non the right consists of a \"basic<br />\nview of the condition of man.<br />\nsociety, and the moral order..<br />\nin which respect for the individual is balanced against the limited role of the government surrounded by the laws of the moral<br />\nuniverse.\"<br />\nCertain discrepancies can be<br />\ngleaned from the body of concepts articulated by Stanton<br />\nEvans as they are translated<br />\ninto political action. The new<br />\nconservatives seek to expand<br />\nfreedom from governmental control, yet they readily accede to<br />\nthe wishes or whims of the military. Some desire that United<br />\nStates foreign policy follow a<br />\nstraight line of self-interest,<br />\nwhile others are concerned with<br />\nits relation to moral norms. Although it is too much to expect<br />\na. fully rationalized doctrine.<br />\nEvans pays scant attention to<br />\ndivergencies either m the movement itself or its relation to<br />\nother conservative groups. The<br />\nactivities of the John Birch Society and other extreme groups<br />\nfail to be mentioned, much less<br />\nevaluated.<br />\nAs a chronology of the new<br />\ncampus conservatism. Revolt on<br />\nthe Campus records the genesis<br />\nof the thought as well as the<br />\nmood of the militant assault<br />\nagainst the liberal establishment.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH 9, 1962<br /><br />\nPAGE ELEVEN<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nBonfires, Visits From Deans 'Quid Pro Quo'Service<br />\nTo Liven Lauderdale Scene For Scholars On Move<br />\nThis bustling lower Atlantic<br />\ncoast resort city, now the training home of the world champion<br />\nNew York Yankees, is making<br />\nready for the 1962 visitation of<br />\ncollege students in March and<br />\nApril.<br />\nPublic spirited citizens are<br />\nWorking zealously with municipal<br />\nofficials to offer vacationing<br />\nundergraduates an interesting<br />\nand varied recreation and entertainment program.
