Polk Printing Company, 1930 Clifton Ave., Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIALS<br />\nWHY ABOLISH FOOTBALL?<br />\nSigning a petition stating that the undersigned believe that the abolishment of any competitive sport at the Johns Hopkins University would<br />\nbe a detriment to the University undergraduate body, over two hundred<br />\nundergraduates took a stand diametricly opposed to that of Dean Berry<br />\nyesterday. At the assembly, student opinion voiced was almost unanimous in favoring the continuance of football. The only object voiced<br />\nwas that if football were continued, no cage would be erected. No evidence was presented to substantiate this opinion. The reverse is nearer<br />\nthe truth in our opinion. Football is a financial asset rather than a liability even at Hopkins. Certain alumni would not contribute to cage if<br />\nall intercollegiate athletics were abolished. We do not believe that the<br />\nabolitiOn of football would aid a cage drive in any way.<br />\nThere seems to be much misunderstanding regarding the statement<br />\nof Dean Berry favoring the abolishment of football. The situation in<br />\nbrief is as follows: President Ames appointed a committee to investigate physical education and athletics. One of the minor points suggested<br />\nto the committe was to consider football in general, not particularly as<br />\nat Hopkins. Dean Berry, as a member of the committee, made the<br />\nstatement that he favored the abolishment of football. This does not<br />\nmean that football will be abolished. The opinions of the remainder<br />\nof the committee have not been officially given, but from the very<br />\ncomposition of the body, we believe that there is little or no chance of<br />\nthese report containing a provision favoring the abolition of football.<br />\nWe can see no reason why football, as it now is at Hopkins, should<br />\nbe dropped. If football were commercialized at Hopkins to the extent<br />\nit is at some other institutions, there would be many arguments for taking this course. Athletes at Hopkins are neither paid nor favored. They<br />\nare not idolized on the campus or in the classroom. The only plausible<br />\nargument against football at Hopkins, is that the teams plays institutions which although inferior scholasticly are consistently better athleticly. A change of schedule would remedy this. It is reasonable to suppose that other universities will follow the movement at the University<br />\nof Pennsylvania and revise their athletic systems so as to keep football<br />\nfrom being overemphasized. Hopkins could probably schedule such<br />\nteams in the future. Football was dropped at Columbia in 1905 due to<br />\nthe fact that too many injuries resulted from the game as played at that<br />\ndate. Later, after the rules had been revised, it was found advisable to<br />\nresume the sport. Although the situations are not analogous, we believe<br />\nthat if Hopkins were to drop football, it would find that for similar<br />\nreasons it would be advisable to again play the game. It was found at<br />\nColumbia that with the abolishment of football, all sports fell into<br />\ndecay. The work of the committee appointed by Dr. Ames is to improve physical education and not to abolish sports.<br />\nAn editorial appearing in one of the daily papers claiming the Board<br />\nof Trustees would be unwise to spend money on a cage, merely served<br />\nto show the ignorance of the writer. Everyone with any knowledge of<br />\nthe situation at Hopkins knows that the Board of Trustees has never<br />\nseriously considered erecting the building. The board realizes that it is<br />\nin no financial position to make such an outlay at the present time.

At the assembly, student opinion voiced was almost unanimous in favoring the continuance of football. The only object voiced<br />\nwas that if football were continued, no cage would be erected. No evidence was presented to substantiate this opinion. The reverse is nearer<br />\nthe truth in our opinion. Football is a financial asset rather than a liability even at Hopkins. Certain alumni would not contribute to cage if<br />\nall intercollegiate athletics were abolished. We do not believe that the<br />\nabolitiOn of football would aid a cage drive in any way.<br />\nThere seems to be much misunderstanding regarding the statement<br />\nof Dean Berry favoring the abolishment of football. The situation in<br />\nbrief is as follows: President Ames appointed a committee to investigate physical education and athletics. One of the minor points suggested<br />\nto the committe was to consider football in general, not particularly as<br />\nat Hopkins. Dean Berry, as a member of the committee, made the<br />\nstatement that he favored the abolishment of football. This does not<br />\nmean that football will be abolished. The opinions of the remainder<br />\nof the committee have not been officially given, but from the very<br />\ncomposition of the body, we believe that there is little or no chance of<br />\nthese report containing a provision favoring the abolition of football.<br />\nWe can see no reason why football, as it now is at Hopkins, should<br />\nbe dropped. If football were commercialized at Hopkins to the extent<br />\nit is at some other institutions, there would be many arguments for taking this course. Athletes at Hopkins are neither paid nor favored. They<br />\nare not idolized on the campus or in the classroom. The only plausible<br />\nargument against football at Hopkins, is that the teams plays institutions which although inferior scholasticly are consistently better athleticly. A change of schedule would remedy this. It is reasonable to suppose that other universities will follow the movement at the University<br />\nof Pennsylvania and revise their athletic systems so as to keep football<br />\nfrom being overemphasized. Hopkins could probably schedule such<br />\nteams in the future. Football was dropped at Columbia in 1905 due to<br />\nthe fact that too many injuries resulted from the game as played at that<br />\ndate. Later, after the rules had been revised, it was found advisable to<br />\nresume the sport. Although the situations are not analogous, we believe<br />\nthat if Hopkins were to drop football, it would find that for similar<br />\nreasons it would be advisable to again play the game. It was found at<br />\nColumbia that with the abolishment of football, all sports fell into<br />\ndecay. The work of the committee appointed by Dr. Ames is to improve physical education and not to abolish sports.<br />\nAn editorial appearing in one of the daily papers claiming the Board<br />\nof Trustees would be unwise to spend money on a cage, merely served<br />\nto show the ignorance of the writer. Everyone with any knowledge of<br />\nthe situation at Hopkins knows that the Board of Trustees has never<br />\nseriously considered erecting the building. The board realizes that it is<br />\nin no financial position to make such an outlay at the present time. A<br />\ncage can be built if a competent committee solicits contributions from<br />\nthe alumni after the undergraduates have clearly shown by their contributions that they need and want such a building.<br />\nIn closing we would like to repeat that we can see no reason why<br />\nthe abolishment of football Is it is at Hopkins would aid any program<br />\nof physical education, or why football and inter-rural athletics cannot<br />\ngo hand in hand after the erection of the cage.<br /><br />\nA Professor Holds Forth<br /><br />\nESTABLISHED 1818<br /><br />\nBy HYMAN LEVIN<br />\nyears.

If Johns<br />\nHopkins took its inspiration from Gilman, if<br />\nRemsen's dogged courage carried it safely<br />\nover troubled years, it is to Goodnow that<br />\nwe owe the spiritual confidence, the lofty<br />\nidealism, the intellectual distinct:on of the<br />\nUniverCty of these days.
