White Athletic Center is an imposing edifice in whose confines can he found excellent<br />\nfacilities ranging from squash and basketball courts to<br />\nbowling alleys and a swimming pool. It is also the likely,<br />\nalbeit little renowned, home of the Lacrosse Hall of<br />\nFame. Unfortunately, to often it is void of its most essential element, namely, the members of the Hopkins student body and faculty for whose use the building was<br />\nsupposedly built.<br />\nUnnecessary restrictions on the part of the athletic<br />\ndepartment prevent the use of the Center to its maximum advantage. Students and faculty are needlessly<br />\nsegregated, having been allotted separate evenings during the week. Furthermore, the hours during which the<br />\nCenter is open are minimal. During the week, hours are<br />\nheld to from four to six in the afternoon, and seven<br />\nto<br />\nnine in the evening. When varsity football and lacros<br />\nse<br />\ngames are held at Homewood, the Center is kept closed<br />\n,<br />\nas well as during vacations, including the summer.<br />\nDissatisfied with this sad state of affairs, a group<br />\nof concerned graduates and faculty members formed<br />\nthe<br />\nStudent-Faculty Committee for a More Useful Athlet<br />\nic<br />\nCenter. Unable to elicit any administration respon<br />\nse<br />\nto<br />\ntheir complaints, which were sent to President<br />\nEisenhower, Dean Shaffer, and athletic direetor Marsha<br />\nTurner, they then conducted a poll whose results strongll<br />\nly<br />\nindicate that changes are necessary.<br />\nOf those that responded to the questionnaire, nearly<br />\n'70% favored elimination of all restrictions, while<br />\nless<br />\n10% expressed satisfaction with the present<br />\nsetup.<br />\nNotable is the fact that 80% of those responding from<br />\nthe faculty favor unrestricted recreation hours. In addition, many respondents expressed the desire to use<br />\nthe<br />\nCenter's facilities during the early afternoon, or late in<br />\nthe evening, times when they are at present excluded.<br />\nAt the Student-Administration Forum last month,<br />\nathletic Director Turner explained that lack of funds<br />\nhas prevented him from keeping the Center open durin<br />\ng<br />\nthe currently disputed limes.

The mere<br />\nfact that Lean had to cut 31<br />\nhours of exposed film to just<br />\nover three hours is a good In<br />\nof how greatly the novel<br />\nhad to be condensed, or should<br />\nI say bastardized?<br />\nThe fact that over 27 hours<br />\nof original film was cut is evident.

The audience is never fully<br />\naware of how enormous the<br />\nRevolution really Is.<br />\nAlso, the characters themselves are, in fact, no more than<br />\ncharacters. There is little life<br />\nto them, their motivations are<br />\nnever very clearly shown, and<br />\nthey are static in that very few<br />\nof them change their characters.<br />\nIn the novel, Zhivago is the allencompassing, all-understanding<br />\nhero who rises above the revolution, while in the movie he is<br />\nthe always-handsome poet who<br />\ncuddles up to his lover like a<br />\nstuffed animal and mutters<br />\nsweet nothings.<br />\nNevertheless, accepting it for<br />\nwhat it is, \"Doctor Zhivago\" is<br />\na great and beautiful film, immensely pleasureable experience.<br />\nThe photography is excellent<br />\n<br />\nthroughout, and Lean uses the<br />\ncamera as an all-seeing eye into<br />\nthe chaotic world of Russia during the revolution and into the<br />\nanguished characters which make<br />\nup this world.-At one point, after<br />\nZhivago and his mistress Lara<br />\nhave hidden in an old yule, the<br />\ncamera moves up to a frosted<br />\nwindow while a candle on the<br />\ninside slowly melts a circle in.<br />\nthe window through which we<br />\nsee the poet Zhivago writing his<br />\npoems to Lara. Lean uses the<br />\ncircle as a symbol of his love,<br />\nof his escape from the new Bolshevik Russia and of his anguish<br />\nin living in a country which he<br />\ndeeply loves but which has<br />\ndrastically changed.

The film<br />\nopens on the steppes in Russia<br />\nwith the 'Urals in the background, a wind gently blowing<br />\nleaves off a tree and over a<br />\ncasket, through the graveyard<br />\nand on into the desolate background.

Aside from the NewsLetter's numerous unfounded assumptions and pre-judgments,<br />\nthe conclusions it has arrived at<br />\nare ludicrous. but I suppose that<br />\nIs keeping within the publication's recent pattern of irresponsibility toward the reader.<br />\nIts implications that I have<br />\nchosen to dwell exclusively upon<br />\nMr. Rustin's lewd past is erroneous.<br />\nOf course, the information<br />\ncontained in the police record<br />\nwas unattractive, but Mr. Rustin, I believe, is an unattractive<br />\nman in belief as well as in background. PRAD (The Political<br />\nResearch, Analysis and Development Committee\u2014not the Political Research and Analysis Department as your reporter inaccurately wrote) gave, if the<br />\nNews-Letter staff will re-read, but<br />\nonly a brief mention of his sexperversion conviction, the record<br />\nbeing attached to quell any<br />\ndoubts as to the authenticity of<br />\nthe charge, the same record<br />\nwhich was distributed by the<br />\nthousands at the University of<br />\nMaryland late last year.<br />\nObscenity laws are vague, but<br />\nthe recent U.S. Supreme Court<br />\npuling clarified the definition by<br />\nSaying if it is designed to arouse<br />\nSexual fantasies, then it is ob-<br />\n<br />\nCan a<br />\nsweet,young<br />\nthing find<br />\nhappiness<br />\non a Honda?<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nfultuur2,<br />\n<br />\nCD<br />\n<br />\nscene.

Neither did I sell the material or asked for a public sexual<br />\nresponse\u2014therefore, what logic<br />\nwould there be in me distributing it for prurient interests?<br />\nMerely, it was designed to support the premise that Mr. Rustin's background does not lend<br />\ncredibility to his pronouncements. In other words, what he<br />\nespouses conflicts with what he<br />\nhas acted upon.<br />\nRustin's psychological disorders seem, according to the<br />\nNews-Letter, to have nothing to<br />\ndo with his political affiliations<br />\nand convictions. This being the<br />\ncase, it negates their insinuations that actions demand that<br />\nI be declared an \"illegitimate\"<br />\nmember of the J.H.U. political<br />\ncommunity, my actions being<br />\nequated with a psychological<br />\ndisorder. If Rustin's disorders<br />\nare not supposed to conflict with<br />\nhis convictions, how is it that my<br />\nalleged disorders affect my beliefs?

The audience is never fully<br />\naware of how enormous the<br />\nRevolution really Is.<br />\nAlso, the characters themselves are, in fact, no more than<br />\ncharacters. There is little life<br />\nto them, their motivations are<br />\nnever very clearly shown, and<br />\nthey are static in that very few<br />\nof them change their characters.<br />\nIn the novel, Zhivago is the allencompassing, all-understanding<br />\nhero who rises above the revolution, while in the movie he is<br />\nthe always-handsome poet who<br />\ncuddles up to his lover like a<br />\nstuffed animal and mutters<br />\nsweet nothings.<br />\nNevertheless, accepting it for<br />\nwhat it is, \"Doctor Zhivago\" is<br />\na great and beautiful film, immensely pleasureable experience.<br />\nThe photography is excellent<br /><br />\nthroughout, and Lean uses the<br />\ncamera as an all-seeing eye into<br />\nthe chaotic world of Russia during the revolution and into the<br />\nanguished characters which make<br />\nup this world.-At one point, after<br />\nZhivago and his mistress Lara<br />\nhave hidden in an old yule, the<br />\ncamera moves up to a frosted<br />\nwindow while a candle on the<br />\ninside slowly melts a circle in.<br />\nthe window through which we<br />\nsee the poet Zhivago writing his<br />\npoems to Lara. Lean uses the<br />\ncircle as a symbol of his love,<br />\nof his escape from the new Bolshevik Russia and of his anguish<br />\nin living in a country which he<br />\ndeeply loves but which has<br />\ndrastically changed.

Aside from the NewsLetter's numerous unfounded assumptions and pre-judgments,<br />\nthe conclusions it has arrived at<br />\nare ludicrous. but I suppose that<br />\nIs keeping within the publication's recent pattern of irresponsibility toward the reader.<br />\nIts implications that I have<br />\nchosen to dwell exclusively upon<br />\nMr. Rustin's lewd past is erroneous.<br />\nOf course, the information<br />\ncontained in the police record<br />\nwas unattractive, but Mr. Rustin, I believe, is an unattractive<br />\nman in belief as well as in background. PRAD (The Political<br />\nResearch, Analysis and Development Committee\u2014not the Political Research and Analysis Department as your reporter inaccurately wrote) gave, if the<br />\nNews-Letter staff will re-read, but<br />\nonly a brief mention of his sexperversion conviction, the record<br />\nbeing attached to quell any<br />\ndoubts as to the authenticity of<br />\nthe charge, the same record<br />\nwhich was distributed by the<br />\nthousands at the University of<br />\nMaryland late last year.<br />\nObscenity laws are vague, but<br />\nthe recent U.S. Supreme Court<br />\npuling clarified the definition by<br />\nSaying if it is designed to arouse<br />\nSexual fantasies, then it is ob-<br /><br />\nCan a<br />\nsweet,young<br />\nthing find<br />\nhappiness<br />\non a Honda?<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nfultuur2,<br /><br />\nCD<br /><br />\nscene.

If Rustin's disorders<br />\nare not supposed to conflict with<br />\nhis convictions, how is it that my<br />\nalleged disorders affect my beliefs?
