Kyle McCarter on Wednesday<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe meeting was centered upon<br />\na discussion of the future of<br />\nclassics at Hopkins. In the past<br />\nyear, Classics has undergone a<br />\nseries of faculty changes that have<br />\nadversely affected it. Normally a<br />\ndepartment with five full-time<br />\nprofessors, the department has<br />\nnow three full-time professors<br />\n<br />\nand two visiting professors.<br />\nThe vacancies in the department resulted from the departure<br />\nof one professor and the resignations of two other senior<br />\nmembers whom other universities<br />\nlured away. The three professors<br />\nnotified the department of their<br />\nintentions too late in the academic<br />\nyear for the department to seek<br />\nreplacements, thus leaving the<br />\ndepartment in a precarious position.

The Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council<br />\nsponsored the forum, in conjunction with<br />\nthe Office of Residential Life.<br />\nThe annual forum, now in its second<br />\nyear, is designed to raise student<br />\nawareness, according to Panhellenic Council organizer Susan Land. Since approximately one-fourth of women at Hopkins<br />\nunder the age of twenty-five have been sexually harrassed, and because of recent<br />\nfraternity-related harassment incidents at<br />\nHopkins, it is important to get these issues<br />\nout into the open, said Land.<br />\nThe forum began at 7:30 with a mixed<br />\ncrowd of Student Council members,<br />\nstudents, and administrators. Land introduced the forum by giving a definition<br />\nof sexual harassment. \"It is basically unwanted sexual attention that makes people<br />\nfeel like they are in a hostile environment,\" she said.<br />\nShe went on to explain sexual harassment \"myths,\" such as the myth that the<br />\nfemale is always at fault. \"Sexual harassment is a concept of power,\" she said,<br />\nbefore showing a video to show the forum<br />\nparticipants what she meant.<br />\nThe video, made at Hopkins last year,<br />\nwith Hopkins students as actors, focused<br />\non one female student with a problem; she<br />\nhad a chemistry lab two weeks overdue.<br />\nThe video showed the woman talking to<br />\nher TA who told her that her problems<br />\n<br />\nwere more serious than just one overdue<br />\nassignment. He cited her poor class attendance and invited her to his apartment to<br />\ndiscuss her situation. \"I'll make dinner,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nThe girl tried to arrange an alternate<br />\nmeeting place, but since the TA did not<br />\nhave office hours that week, accepting his<br />\noffer was the only way she would be able<br />\nto talk to him.<br />\nAfter the video, students and Council<br />\nmembers split into three different groups<br />\nto discuss three different scenarios, similar<br />\nto the one shown on video. Each student<br />\nwas handed a type-written scenario, and<br />\nboth IFC and Panhellenic council members<br />\nlead discussions. Two scenarios depicted<br />\nmales forcing females into compromising<br />\npositions, and one involved a female who<br />\nput a male into a compromising position.<br />\nOne question many people raised was,<br />\n\"Where does harassment start?\" Many<br />\nagreed that it starts as soon as a woman<br />\nsays \"no\" to an advance, at which point<br />\nshe is harassed further or verbally abused. Depending on the scenario, some<br />\nthought the harassment began earlier, some<br />\nlater. Nearly everyone agreed that when<br />\na woman says \"no\" she means \"no\" not<br />\n\"yes\" or \"maybe.\"<br />\nIn discussing the scenario in which the<br />\nmale was put in a compromising position,<br />\nparticipants saw the problem of sexual<br />\nharassment differently. One student<br />\nbrought to the forum's attention his belief<br />\nthat an ethics board would not take the<br />\nmale's complaint seriously. However,<br />\nmany disagreed.<br />\nSusan Boswell, director of student ac-<br />\n<br />\nEly Brown<br />\n<br />\nSenior Susan Land, an organizer of this year's Male and Female Sexuality Forum,speaks<br />\nto Tim Rosenzweig, president of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, at Wednesday's forum.<br />\n<br />\ntivities, gave some concluding remarks.<br />\nShe reiterated the group consensus that<br />\n\"no\" means \"no,\" whether spoken by a<br />\nmale or female, and that no one had<br />\ndefinitive answers regarding where blame<br />\nbegins in a case of harassment.<br />\nShe explained that the Sexual Harassment Advisor's Network, drawn from<br />\n<br />\nstaff, administration, and faculty, is open<br />\nfor anyone who needs help in deciding how<br />\nto handle sexual harassment.

The university says it will<br />\nuse any profits for research.<br />\nWhile start-up funds exist at a<br />\n<br />\nhandful of universities\u2014<br />\nWashington University has one,<br />\nfor example, and Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity if planning one\u2014the<br />\nHarvard Project is the most<br />\nsignificant yet announced.<br />\nHarvard's decision to create a<br />\nventure fund for its own professors is especially notable<br />\nbecause in 1980 the university rejected a stake in a new company<br />\nthen being formed by one of its<br />\nfaculty members. Such an arrangement, Harvard officials<br />\nfeared, might induce professors<br />\nto sacrifice free inquiry in favor<br />\nof potentially profitable research.<br />\nThat decision reverberated<br />\nthrough the academic community, prompting wide caution about<br />\nlinks between academe and industry.

Atkinson,<br />\ndirector of technology licensing at<br />\nHarvard's medical school.<br />\nMr. Atkinson said the fund was<br />\ndesigned to accelerate the transfer<br />\nof new technologies and products<br />\nfrom the laboratory to the<br />\nmarketplace.<br />\nCurrently, he said, that process<br />\n<br />\nmoves more slowly than Harvard<br />\nwould like, particularly with innovations requiring long-term<br />\ndevelopment. Because most companies want immediate results,<br />\nseveral \"seminal technologies\"<br />\ndiscovered at Harvard have gone<br />\nundeveloped, Mr. Atkinson said.<br />\nThe project will be managed by<br />\nAndre L. Lamotte, a former drug<br />\ncompany executive and consultant recruited to Harvard. He will<br />\nassess research at the medical<br />\nschool and its affiliated hospitals,<br />\nlooking for marketable prospects.<br />\nNo researcher will be required to<br />\ncooperate with Mr. Lamotte.<br />\nMr. Atkinson said the design of<br />\nthe fund, which is set up as a<br />\nlimited partnership in which Harvard participates through a subsidiary corporation, would insure<br />\nan arm's-length distance between<br />\nthe university and the fund's<br />\noperation.<br />\n<br />\nAcademic freedom will be protected in other ways, too, he said.<br />\nA special faculty panel will<br />\nreview all proposals for research<br />\nto be financed by the venture, and<br />\nall decisions about spinoff companies and products will be left to<br />\nMr. Lamotte. The fund will be<br />\nrun as a business independent of<br />\nthe university, and Mr. Lamotte<br />\nand other managers will receive<br />\n10 per cent of any profits.<br />\nDespite appearances, Mr.<br />\nAtkinson said Harvard does not<br />\nsee the creation of its venture<br />\nfund as a policy reversal. The<br />\n1980 decision barred the university from holding stock in any<br />\ncompany based on its faculty's<br />\nresearch.

While there was a severe budget<br />\ndeficit, while there would be a shrinking faculty, while 'choices' would have to be made, and<br />\n'priorities' established, and while tuition would<br />\nnecessarily have to increase, students, we were<br />\ntold, would not be 'adversely affected'. Not to<br />\nworry, it was emphasized; the deficit was the<br />\nresult of errors in judgement, however, it was<br />\nnothing that couldn't be sorted out in due time.<br />\nThe acceptance is almost naive in retrospect.<br />\nThe University's mission, is, after all, to<br />\neducate. Accordingly, if the University's cure<br />\nfor a million dollar deficit is to reduce the<br />\nnumber of educators, prioritize departmental<br />\nneeds and choose between them, then the<br />\nsystem and the students are likely to suffer.<br />\nThe University's attrition medicine is particularly troublesome to some of the smaller<br />\ndepartments at Homewood, where the loss of<br />\none or two professors constitutes the loss of a<br />\nsignificant percentage of their total faculty.<br />\nThe Classics Department may be seen as a<br />\nparadigm of this situation. This semester the<br />\nnumber of full time professors decreased from<br />\nfive to three as faculty were lured away by more<br />\nattractive offers from other universities.<br />\nAlthough the problem was corrected somewhat<br />\nwith two visiti-a -rofessors this year, there is<br />\n<br />\nstill just one tenured professor. Hopkins is<br />\nunable to immediately replace these crucial<br />\nmembers, in large part due to the limitations<br />\nplaced on hiring because of the deficit.<br />\nThe situation is an uncomfortable one. For<br />\nthe department to function, there must be a<br />\nminimum of certain components; if any one of<br />\nthese components is taken away, the structure<br />\nof the department will be adversely affected in<br />\na cascading manner. Without sufficient<br />\nnumbers and quality of professors,(and the<br />\nability to attract them) graduate students are<br />\nunlikely to choose Hopkins' department; with<br />\nneither professors nor graduate students,<br />\nundergraduates are unlikely to major in<br />\nClassics; and finally, without sufficient professors, graduate students, and undergraduate<br />\nmajors, the University risks losing not only the<br />\nlongtime excellent reputation enjoyed by the<br />\nClassics Department, but its overall reputation<br />\nas well.<br />\nFor the time being, however, an air of uncertainty permeates the Classics Department, and<br />\nindeed all the smaller departments. What will<br />\nbe their future within the University? Will they<br />\ncontinue to exist as separate enitities, or will<br />\nthey be merged with other departments with<br />\n'similar interests', an idea suggested by Dean<br />\nArmstrong last spring. And whatever the future<br />\nholds, what can the departments do to maintain their status quo today?<br />\nThe administration would do well to clarify<br />\nits position and reassert its commitment to the<br />\ndepartments. Addressing the problems on an<br />\nad hoc basis only contributes to the general<br />\nuncertainty. And although we are less naive<br />\nnow than a semester ago, we are no less receptive to administrative response.<br />\n<br />\nJoining the World<br />\nPresident Muller's speech this week to the<br />\nYoung Democrats and College Republicans<br />\nbrought up a particularly nauseating statistic:<br />\nhe estimates that eighty percent of Hopkins<br />\nstudents will not vote in the upcoming elections<br />\nin November.<br />\nStudent Council elections are no stranger to<br />\nthis fact. Many of the people who have sat on<br />\nCouncil this year and in previous years have<br />\nwon their positions in uncontested elections, or<br />\nwith an abysmally low proportions of students<br />\nnot taking the time at (can you believe it) the<br />\nlibrary to jot down a vote and drop it in the box.<br />\nSurprise, surprise, you say. Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates have long been renowned for<br />\ntheir apathetic stance towards anything but a<br />\ngood GPA and an assured chance at future<br />\ncareer successes.<br />\nA primary reason for voter abstention is the<br />\nfeeling that casting a vote makes no difference<br />\nin the outcome. The actual problem with this<br />\ntheory is that en masse neglect of the voting<br />\nstalls leaves a tremendous amount of power in<br />\nthe hands of those who do vote. So, in a sense,<br />\nif you really cared about making a difference,<br />\nyou would take advantage of your statistical<br />\nedge and run to the polls. Even in the unlikely<br />\ncircumstance that record numbers of voters<br />\nheed this gem of advice, it could do no possible harm to have too great a percentage of the<br />\npopulation contributing to the choice of its<br />\nmutual leader.<br />\nSimilarly, with Council elections, it is puzzl-<br />\n<br />\ning to note that those who yell the loudest about<br />\nour campus life are the very ones who laugh<br />\nwhen you mention taking time out from a busy<br />\nday to vote. In a smaller sphere, with so few<br />\npeople voting, the vote counts even more, and<br />\nhas more impact on things that directly affect<br />\nstudents\u2014student services, most importantly.<br />\nThe campus leaders are, for the most part, those<br />\nwho relay to administrators that which their<br />\nconstituents need.<br />\nParadoxical, too, that the pre-professional<br />\nHopkins student working on an undergraduate<br />\neducation from which he will have to emerge<br />\nand face the tough new world would ignore an<br />\nelection which will have a tremendous effect<br />\non what he faces upon graduation. In all probablility, we will all be establishing our careers<br />\nthen\u2014can we afford not to vote?<br />\nThe bare essential of this issue is as follows:<br />\nlife at Hopkins is a lot of planning of future<br />\nmoves\u2014the pre-professional atmosphere sets<br />\nour sights on goals which we are light-years<br />\naway from acheiving, creating a sort of tunnel<br />\nvision and iack of awareness of the situation<br />\nwhich immediately surrounds us. Being a<br />\n*grown-up means a lot more than living a few<br />\nhundred miles away from your parents, feeding<br />\nyourself, paying bills, and carrying a heavy<br />\nworkload. Accepting responsibility for your actions and your role within society is an essential component of life and must be your ultimate<br />\ngoal. Life goes on beyond this campus, and for<br />\nthat matter, beyond your course load.<br />\n<br />\npseudoperspicacity<br />\njonathan engler<br />\nWith Human Climate reports,<br />\nArts and Sciences deficits,<br />\nburgeoning Humanities class<br />\nsizes thanks to more students,<br />\nfewer faculty and less money,<br />\nAcademic Advising's move from<br />\ntheir Merryman bomb shelter to<br />\nMergenthaler, and Steve Muller's<br />\nexhortations not to worry, a<br />\nHopkins undergradute could be<br />\nforgiven for feeling a bit like a<br />\ndog which has wandered into the<br />\nmiddle of a twelve lane highway<br />\nat rush hour. Everyone wants to<br />\ntoot his own horn, but no one<br />\nwants to get out of his seat and<br />\nhelp out.<br />\nThe first step to getting out of<br />\nthis traffic situation is to accept<br />\nwhat one cannot change.<br />\nHomewood is just one of many<br />\nJohns Hopkins institutions, and<br />\nwe are clearly not the administration's sole concern. It is difficult<br />\nto understand the complaints that<br />\nwe are just a drop in the Hopkins<br />\nbucket. Of course we are. Believe<br />\nit or not, this situation predates<br />\nour enrollment.<br />\nAt the same time, an enterprising Hoppy has a tremendous<br />\namount of freedom to do as he or<br />\nshe pleases. We are hardly under<br />\nanyone's microscope as far as<br />\nfreedom of action goes. A student<br />\ncan design a major, live where he<br />\nlikes (provided that it's not the<br />\ndorms),join any number of campus organizations, and take<br />\ncourses with people who are<br />\npreeminent in their fields.<br />\nGranted, these people are often<br />\nmore interested in their research<br />\nthan in us, but academia is not<br />\nalways your instant TV dinner.<br />\nSometimes, in order to get<br />\nsomething really extraordinary<br />\nout of a class or a professor re-<br />\n<br />\nquires putting something really<br />\nextraordinary in.<br />\nBut it's true\u2014the undergraduate really has to lobby or at<br />\nleast exert himself in order to get<br />\ninto the majority of such classes<br />\n(although if you aren't willing to<br />\nmake at least some sort of effort,<br />\nyou must have been completely<br />\nmisguided to have decided to<br />\ncome here in the first place). It<br />\nseems that Hopkins basically has<br />\ntwo major things to offer to the<br />\nundergraduate: first, a highpowered faculty that could not<br />\nhave been assembled merely for<br />\nthe benefit of undergraduates<br />\nalone. Second, and this is probably more important than most<br />\nof us would like to admit,<br />\nHopkins' prestige is derived from<br />\nthe collective excellence of our<br />\nuniversity. A diploma is worth<br />\nmore now than it probably would<br />\nwere<br />\nbe<br />\nHomewood<br />\nundergraduates the sole focus at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAnother common complaint<br />\nhere is the housing situation,<br />\nsomething which is supposed to<br />\ncause all sorts of problems, not<br />\nthe least of which is the oftcommented on lack of community at Homewood. Combined with<br />\nacademic pressures from above,<br />\nwe are supposedly pummelled<br />\nwith the distractions of offcampus living too early on.<br />\nThere is certainly a great deal<br />\nof truth to this.

The JHU Coalition for a<br />\nFree South Africa has mixed<br />\nfeelings.<br />\nThe most important problem<br />\nremains the fact that Hopkins<br />\ncontinues to invest $44 million in<br />\nSouth Africa-related securities.<br />\nTreasurer Eugene Sunshine has<br />\njust completed a minor divestment of a company that did not<br />\ncomply with the Sullivan Principles, but those \"fair emplyment\" principles are a corporate<br />\nsham made irrelevant long ago.<br />\n(Rev.

One year, Hopkins<br />\neven voted to support IBM in its<br />\npolicy of supplying the South<br />\nAfrican government with<br />\nproducts.<br />\nBut opposing a U.S. corporate<br />\n<br />\npresence in South Africa can be<br />\nmore sincerely backed up by<br />\ndivesting (selling) those companies' stocks.<br />\nHopkins must not be seen as<br />\nsupporting a \"constructive<br />\nengagement' policy with corporations which refuse to see the<br />\nhandwriting on the wall. History<br />\nhas shown that shareholer resolutions on South Africa disinvestment(leaving South Africa) never<br />\ngarner more than 20 percent of<br />\nthe vote.<br />\nSo if Hopkins really wants to<br />\nhave an impact, it is only through<br />\nparticipation in university and<br />\npension fund mass shareholder<br />\nsales that we will send corporations the unequivocal message to<br />\nend their support for the apartheid<br />\ncurrent<br />\nThe<br />\neconomy.<br />\nshareholder strategy favored by<br />\nthe Trustees is clearly an ineffectual cop-out.<br />\nBut this is not surprising. There<br />\nare still more than a dozen<br />\nHopkins Trustees whose employment by companies that do<br />\nbusiness in or with South Africa<br />\nput them in clear conflict of interest on this question. The Coalition renews the call for these<br />\nTrustees to leave the Board and<br />\nthe Hopkins community unless<br />\nthey exercise their moral duty and<br />\nrefrain from further debate and<br />\nparticipation on the divestment<br />\nissue.<br />\nA prime example of a conflict<br />\n<br />\nof interest is Hopkins' strong ties<br />\nto the Millipore Corporation of<br />\nMassachusettes,<br />\nBedford,<br />\nthrough the directorship in that<br />\ncompany of Hopkins President<br />\n(and Trustee) Steven Muller, and<br />\nthrough other product arrangements. Millipore sold its<br />\nSouth African subsidiary on<br />\nDecember 1, 1985, but the latest<br />\navailable information from<br />\nreliable sources indicates that<br />\nMillipore \"retains a trademark<br />\nagreement with its former South<br />\nAfrican subsidiary., Such a<br />\npolicy is called \"sham disinvestment,\" and Dr. Muller should be<br />\nashamed to participate inits<br />\nformulation.<br />\nIt would be embarrassing to all<br />\nof us if the U.S. Congress, which<br />\nis currently considering comprehensive mandatory sanctions<br />\nagainst South Africa, acts next<br />\nmonth to preempt a strong moral<br />\nstand by our university. This is<br />\nespecially true given the enormous student, faculty and staff interest in this issue, the majority<br />\nsupport for divestment by<br />\nHopkins students, and the fact<br />\nthat many South Africans (including two members of the Tutu<br />\nfaminly and one Mandela) have<br />\ntaken great pains to come to<br />\nHopkins and to graphically<br />\ndescribe to us conditions in their<br />\nhomeland.<br />\nSince 1985, Hopkins has had a<br />\nSee BOND, 10<br />\n<br />\nTHE MAGIC AND COMEDY OF riallN<br />\n11011 GARNER<br />\nThursday, October 6<br />\n9:00 PM<br />\nArellano Theater<br />\nTickets $2.00<br />\n<br />\n)0,1<br />\n<br />\nickets Available at:<br />\nThe Union Desk<br />\nThe Terrace Room<br />\n(5:30-7:00 pm)<br />\n<br />\nThe Levering Patio<br />\n(12:00 1:00 pm)<br />\nSPONSORED BY THE HOP SPECIAL PROGRAMS COMMITTEE<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022 10/SEPTEMBER 30. 1988<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\npseudo<br />\nPSEUDO, from 9<br />\nHopkins in undergraduate size,<br />\nalso populated heavily with<br />\ngraduate students and a faculty<br />\ndeeply involved in research. Like<br />\nour campus, it is urban. In a<br />\nrough parallel of our own premed/non-premed split, CMU is<br />\ndivided down the middle into<br />\nwhat they call the Fruits (liberal<br />\nartsies) and the Veggies<br />\n(science/computer types). But<br />\nthere is a much stronger sense of<br />\ncommunity, at least within these<br />\ngroups, than there is at<br />\nHomewood. This, despite the fact<br />\nthat all of their on-campus housing is farther away from campus<br />\nproper than any of ours is.<br />\nThrow into their list of<br />\nnegatives a student union which<br />\nis even more pathetic than ours,<br />\nand appears destined to become<br />\na swimming pool and gymnasium<br />\nin the near future.<br />\nWhy then the better community atmosphere? There would appear to be a two fold explanation.<br />\nMost importantly is an administration that is at least outwardly much more supportive of<br />\nits undergraduates. No doubt this<br />\nhas something to do with the fact<br />\nthat CMU's undergraduate division is much more important in<br />\nproportion to the rest of the<br />\nuniversity than ours. CMU is not<br />\nthe giant international corporation<br />\nthat is Johns Hopkins. But when<br />\na large number of CMU students<br />\nwere arrested en masse by an<br />\noverzealous police department at<br />\na frat party, the administration<br />\n<br />\ncame down solidly on the side of<br />\nthe students and helped to protect<br />\ntheir rights. It is difficult to imagine such supportive behavior<br />\nfrom the Muller crowd here,<br />\nunless, of course, the arrested<br />\nwere lacrosse players.<br />\nThe primary difference between CMU and Hopkins lies<br />\nelsewhere, in a much more basic<br />\nvein. CMU students are simply<br />\nmore supportive of campus<br />\nevents of the non-fraternity sort.<br />\nmore involved and less apathetic<br />\ntoward their fellow students and<br />\ntheir University. Our basic problem here lies with the students,<br />\nnot solely with administration.<br />\nHopkins boasts some very supportive and effective administrators, who, curiously<br />\nenough, serve as models for other<br />\nuniversities, in particular<br />\nCarnegie Mellon. According to<br />\ntheir admissions department, they<br />\nlook to Johns Hopkins' Student<br />\nActivities department for inspiration. No way, you say.<br />\nAnyone who has tried to<br />\norganize a new student activity at<br />\nHomewood and has encountered<br />\nDr. Susan Kulesa Boswell will<br />\nunderstand why this is true.<br />\nThere are few people at this<br />\nuniversity more positive, helpful<br />\nand encouraging than she. Not<br />\nonly can she help with everything<br />\nfrom planning to funding, but she<br />\ndoes so with an enthusiasm and<br />\nsupportiveness that contrasts with<br />\nthe way undergraduates are<br />\nusually dealt with around here.<br />\nWhen one realizes the services<br />\nwe have at our disposal in Student<br />\nActivities, the lack of community atmosphere does not seem to<br />\nbe something which can be so<br />\n<br />\neasily blamed on the administration alone.<br />\nDiscussing with some consternation the poor community atmosphere at Hopkins, Dr.<br />\nBoswell said, \"[Student Activities] is here to be responsive<br />\nto the need and interests of<br />\nstudents...we're very flexible and<br />\nvery often able to meet what<br />\nstudents may want to do.\" Dr.<br />\nBoswell also commented on the<br />\nlow level of attendance at many<br />\nSee PSEUDO, 23<br />\n<br />\nnot cease protesting those investments.

More<br />\nthan a few Hopkins students make<br />\nit part of their Saturday morning<br />\nroutine. Hopkins professors can<br />\nalso be found there dressed in<br />\nshorts and toting canvas bags full<br />\nof their purchases.<br />\nAccording to Professor<br />\nRichard Kagan, the market is \"a<br />\nmarvelous Saturday morning<br />\nfamily outing\" for his three-anda-half year old, who loves \"picking the flowers, touching the<br />\ncrabs, and fingering the fruit.\"<br />\nSophomore Pam Maxwell, her<br />\narms full with sacks of apples,<br />\npeaches, pears, cucumbers, and<br />\nwheat rolls, said she made the<br />\nshort trip this Saturday, \"because<br />\nmy roommate came the last two<br />\ntimes and it's my turn.\"<br />\nMaxwell bought her rolls from<br />\na table set up by Jocelyne's<br />\n<br />\nBakery, a newly-opened French<br />\nbakery on Greenmount Avenue.<br />\nWhile Jocelyne's offers more<br />\nAmericanized wheat and rye<br />\nrolls, sourdough bread, and fruit<br />\nturnovers, their specialties are<br />\nFrench: croissants (filled and<br />\nplain), brioches, bagettes, and<br />\nvarious pastries.<br />\nUp the way from the Jocelyne's<br />\ntable, Rob and Lucy Wood of<br />\nSproutwood Farm, Glenrock,<br />\nPennsylvania offers freshly baked muffins, tea breads, and pies.<br />\nIf you want zucchini, banana, or<br />\ncarrot breads or blueberry muffins, they are here.<br />\nOn one side of the baked goods<br />\nare dried flower wreaths.

The<br />\nCalifornian Students Association<br />\n(CASA) was started last year by<br />\nCalifornians who felt that not<br />\nenough was done to prepare incoming students from the West<br />\nCoast for the different life at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nOver the summer, CASA<br />\nstudents contacted freshmen in<br />\n<br />\nCalifornia and helped them<br />\nprepare for the Great Trek,<br />\nanswering questions and giving<br />\nhelpful suggestion. While this has<br />\nbeen the group's only activity so<br />\nfar, there are plans for many<br />\nthings to come.<br />\nBrian Liddicoat, one of the<br />\ngroup's founders and its chief<br />\norganizer, says that aside from<br />\naiding incoming freshmen,<br />\nCASA has two broad goals to<br />\nachieve. The first is to assist<br />\nAlumni, the Western Regional<br />\n<br />\nEly Brown<br />\n<br />\nMembers of the California Students Association(CASA)smile for the camera at their first meeting of the year.<br />\n<br />\nOffice, and the Office of Admissions in recruiting in high<br />\nschools. The idea is that while<br />\nHopkins gains more exposure on<br />\nthe West Coast, the students will<br />\nhave more interaction with the<br />\nalumni and thus be more likely to<br />\nbecome actively involved with<br />\nalumni functions in the years to<br />\ncome. It is also hoped that the<br />\ngreater student involvement in the<br />\nadmissions process will help to<br />\nmake it more bearable for the<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nThe second goal is to sponsor<br />\na variety of social events, or as<br />\nLiddicoat puts it, to promote<br />\n\"year-long frivolity and entertainment through a whole slew of<br />\nmarashinatin' good times!\" Plans<br />\nin the works are for trips on the<br />\nPotomac, to Kings Dominionn,<br />\nand to Baltimore landmarks,\"<br />\nsays Liddicoat. \"Basically, the<br />\nidea is to do what people want to<br />\ndo.\"<br />\nActivities are not only being<br />\nplanned on the East Coast, but for<br />\nthe West Coast as well. Liddicoat<br />\nmentioned that two CASA<br />\nmembers made a trip to Palm<br />\nSprings (the Fort Lauderdale of<br />\nthe west) during Spring Break last<br />\nyear, and thought that similar<br />\nplans might be made this year.<br />\nOther proposed activities for the<br />\nWest Coast include big weekend<br />\nparties and trips to nearby<br />\nMexico.<br />\nLiddicoat is quick to point out<br />\nthat even though the name of the<br />\n<br />\ngroup implies that it is just for<br />\nCalifornians, CASA is open to<br />\nanyone interested. \"We harbor<br />\nno aims of exclusivity,\" he says.<br />\n(\"When our operations in<br />\nCalifornia have succeeded, we'll<br />\ntry to spread our efforts to the rest<br />\nof the Western United States.\")<br />\nIt is interesting to note that of the<br />\nsixty current members, twothirds are not Californian, and<br />\nover half are not even from the<br />\nWest Coast.<br />\nCASA has no ties with SAC,<br />\nclaiming no need for such affiliation. \"We rely on our own labor,<br />\nour own ingenuity, and our own<br />\nresources,\" Liddicoat says.<br />\n\"Anything else we need, we get<br />\nfrom the Western Regional Office.\" He admits that the group<br />\nowes a lot to Rachel Hendrickson<br />\nand Dr. Longaker in the Western<br />\nRegional Office, as well as to the<br />\nmany alumni in the western<br />\nstates, but maintains that the club<br />\nis still an independent organization, despite its proposed work<br />\nfor Admissions.<br />\nThe group will begin to hold<br />\nregular meetings in the near<br />\nfuture, and invites anyone who is<br />\ninterested to join. \"CASA is<br />\nprincipally a service organization,\" says Liddicoat. \"Our goal<br />\nis to get people to help<br />\nthemselves. Once that happens,<br />\nthere won't be any need for the<br />\nclub. Until then, we'll be using<br />\nwhat we have, doing what we<br />\ncan.\"<br />\n<br />\ng<br />\nC<br />\nd<br />\nE<br />\no<br />\nC<br />\n)<br />\nti<br />\nfi<br />\ntl<br />\nfi<br />\nd<br />\nN<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\na<br />\nE<br />\nii<br />\nt!<br />\n<br />\n\fA<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nrts<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nby Andy Rieser<br />\nPopular culture is perhaps too<br />\nquick to accept the stereotypical<br />\nimage ofjazz as the music of the<br />\neconomically underpriviledged<br />\nand the socially repressed. This<br />\ncan be seen in \"Moscow on the<br />\nHudson,\" Where the typical jazz<br />\nclub is portrayed as a seedy,<br />\nsmoke-filled room.<br />\nThere is no question that jazz<br />\noriginated and developed to a<br />\ngreat extent within the musical<br />\ncircles of the depressed American<br />\ninner-city. Many great jazz musicians from Louis Armstrong to<br />\nMiles Davis were unable to afford<br />\ninstrumental training in their<br />\nchildhood\u2014they relied on the<br />\nscratch recordings of their<br />\nmusical predecessors and constant experimentation and practice<br />\nto achieve their level of mastery.<br />\nIn the 60's, however, the<br />\ngeneral increase in racial<br />\nawareness within universities<br />\nbrought jazz into the musical curriculum. Jazz improvisation was<br />\nthen studied as a bona fide art<br />\nform, an expression of cultural<br />\nand emotional identity. More and<br />\nmore intellectuals began listening, appreciating, and patronizing<br />\njazz artists. The beloved smoke-<br />\n<br />\nfilled den of iniquity ceased to<br />\nbecome the sole medium for the<br />\njazzmen of the 70's and 80's.<br />\nYuppie-ish, more upscale, night<br />\nclubs sprang up in many<br />\nAmerican cities, including<br />\nBaltimore, a city deceptively rich<br />\nin jazz.

The<br />\ncover charge is between $15 and<br />\n$25.<br />\nOn a much more accessable<br />\nlevel for college students interested in taking in an evening of<br />\njazz is Bertha's Dining Room, at<br />\n734 S.Broadway (327-5795).<br />\nLocated in the heart of quaint<br />\nFells Point, Bertha's has no cover<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\ncharge and no minimum.<br />\npectedly.

Despite the traditional<br />\nrock and roll lifestyle, it's clear<br />\nMetallica aren't a group of empty headed party fiends.

Their source material is<br />\nclassic teenage angst: greed,<br />\nfreedom, and hypocrisy. Powerful stuff. Unfortunately, they<br />\ntranslate it all into cliche. With<br />\ntitles like \"Eye of the Beholder\"<br />\nand \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\", it's hard not to wince and<br />\neasier to laugh.

If they had gotten<br />\njust a few breaks or one big play,<br />\nthey might be 3-0 instead of 0-3.<br />\nBut once again last Friday night,<br />\nthe Blue Jays came up empty and<br />\ndropped their home opener 13-9<br />\nto Fairleigh Dickinson in front of<br />\na crowd of 1,200.<br />\nLate in the third quarter it appeared the gods might finally be<br />\non the Jays' side. Trailing 13-9,<br />\nHopkins put together an impressive drive highlighted by a<br />\nkey 20-yard, third down reception by Brian Hepting. The Blue<br />\nJays drove down to the FDU<br />\n13-yard line, where the drive<br />\nstalled. On a fourth and four,<br />\nquarterback Gary Rupert completed perhaps the most unusual<br />\nand spectacular pass of his career.<br />\nRupert's pass was deflected at the<br />\nline by a Devil defender, but the<br />\nball bounced right back into the<br />\nsenior quarterback's hands, and<br />\nhe scampered six yards to give<br />\nHopkins a first and goal at the<br />\nFDU seven. After Brian Dulin<br />\nwas stopped just short of the end<br />\nzone on the third down, Rupert<br />\nwas once again faced with a<br />\nfourth down about two feet from<br />\nthe goal line. He opted for the<br />\nquarterback sneak.<br />\n\"Gary felt he could get it in and<br />\nhe asked for the call,\" commented Coach Jerry Pfeifer. \"He<br />\nfelt the QB sneak had been open<br />\n<br />\nBob Nelson<br />\n<br />\nGary Rupert pitches the ball to Brian Dulin, who rushed for 104 yards on 19 carries.<br />\n<br />\nall day, and he went in behind<br />\ntwo good linemen.\"<br />\nUnfortunately, a wall of Devil<br />\ndefenders were there to stuff<br />\nRupert and nullify a beautiful<br />\ndrive by the Blue Jays. Hopkins<br />\nnever really got close to the end<br />\nzone again, although Fairleigh's<br />\noffense tried to give them the opportunity. Despite the tremendous play of the Blue Jay defense,<br />\ntwo Hopkins drives in the closing<br />\nminute ended in interceptions,<br />\nand FDU held on to remain<br />\nunbeaten.<br />\nIn the first half, it appeared the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins offense was finally starting to click under Rupert. After<br />\nthe Devils scored on their opening drive, Brian Dulin took over<br />\nfor the Jays. Ripping through the<br />\nFairleigh defense on several key<br />\nthird down plays, Dulin set up a<br />\ntwo yard TD plunge by Rupert to<br />\ntie the score at seven. Dulin was<br />\nsuperb all day; he demonstrated<br />\nhis form of a year ago by gaining<br />\n104 yards on 19 carries.<br />\nBut those were the final points<br />\nthe offense could generate. The<br />\ndefense once again kept Hopkins<br />\nin the game by scoring a safety<br />\n<br />\nat the end of the first half after the<br />\nFDU punter fell on an errant snap<br />\nin the end zone. Early in the third<br />\nquarter, the defense finally had a<br />\nbreakdown. After watching his<br />\nquarterback Mike Roedelbronn<br />\nget flushed out of the pocket,<br />\nFDU receiver Dave Van Brunt<br />\ngot free in the end zone for a<br />\n32-yard TD strike to give the<br />\nDevils a 13-9 lead. So once again<br />\nthe Blue Jay defense tried to make<br />\nup for the lack of offense and<br />\ncame up just short.<br />\n\"I believe the offense will<br />\ncome around and reach the level<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n11*<br />\n4<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nGary Rupert calls the signals in the first half of Friday night's game.<br />\n<br />\nof the defense soon,\" said senior<br />\nlineback Mike Fenzel. \"They've<br />\nbeen working their tails off in<br />\npractice, and they're beginning to<br />\nmesh as a unit.\"<br />\nIndeed, the offense showed<br />\ngreat potential this week, despite<br />\ntheir inability to put points on the<br />\nboard. The team responded well<br />\nto Rupert's leadership, especially the running attack. If they can<br />\ncut down on the turnovers and get<br />\nsome kind of passing game working they just might start playing<br />\nup to the defense.<br />\nBut the Blue Jays are running<br />\nout of time in the 1988 football<br />\ncampaign. This Saturday's game<br />\nagainst Gettysburg marks the<br />\nbeginning of the most difficult<br />\npart of the Jays' schedule.<br />\nDespite their 0-3 start, the<br />\nveterans on the squad remain extremely optimistic.<br />\n\"If the defense plays up to its<br />\npotential and the offense comes<br />\naround, there is no way we can<br />\nlose those games. This is the best<br />\ndefensive team I've ever played<br />\non,\" said Fenzel.<br />\nNotes: Dulin's 104 yards last<br />\nweek gave him 175 yards on 38<br />\ncarries for the season. He now<br />\nhas 1,368 yards rushing in his<br />\ncareer at Hopkins, moving him<br />\ninto sixth place on the JHU alltime leading rushers list.<br />\n<br />\nBob Nelson<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nHopkins gricimen hope to end eighty year j<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\njinx<br />\n<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\nYou'd have to go back an<br />\nawfully long way, back to the<br />\ndays when the Hopkins football<br />\nschedule included the likes of<br />\nPenn State, to find the last time<br />\nthat the Blue Jays defeated Gettysburg. Going into this Saturday's matchup here at<br />\nHomewood, the Bullets hold a<br />\n11-1-2 series advantage over<br />\nHopkins, with the only loss coming somewhere around 1915.<br />\nLast year, the Bullets explod-<br />\n<br />\ned for 20 points in the second<br />\nquarter to rout the Jays 30-6. Gettysburg racked up 299 yards on<br />\nthe ground, and most of the backs<br />\nreturn for this season's matchup.<br />\nSenior co-captain Bob Wolfe and<br />\njunior Bob Krokenberger will<br />\nreturn at the halfback spots, while<br />\njunior Mike Rosenberger will<br />\nhandle the fullback responsibilities for the Bullets. Absent,<br />\nhowever, is quarterback Tony<br />\nCampana, who was lost to<br />\ngraduation after leading Gettysburg to a 7-3 record. His<br />\n<br />\nreplacement is senior Chip Rossi,<br />\na converted defensive back who<br />\nhas struggled so far by completing only 16 of 38 passes for<br />\n209 yards in three games.<br />\nRossi will have an outstanding<br />\nline in front of him, led by potential All-American guard Chris<br />\nKakalec. Kakalec, a six foot, 246<br />\npounder from Madison, New<br />\nJersey anchors an offensive front<br />\nwhich averages around 230<br />\npounds. The Bullets' defense has<br />\nplayed very well so far this<br />\nseason, especially junior<br />\n<br />\nlinebacker Ron DeLuca, who<br />\nleads the team with 39 tackles(29<br />\nsolo). DeLuca had 13 tackles,<br />\nforced a fumble and recovered<br />\nanother, and had a key interception with just 1:03 remaining to<br />\nsecure last week's 27-19 victory<br />\nover Swarthmore.<br />\nThe Bullets' biggest weapon,<br />\nhowever, may be their<br />\nplacekicker Jerry Mihalick.<br />\nMihalick, a junior, booted a<br />\n41-yarder to defeat Western<br />\nMaryland 17-14, and last week he<br />\nhit from 41 twice and 42 once. In<br />\n<br />\na close game, Mihalick's foot just<br />\nmight be the deciding factor.<br />\nGettysbutfi,currently 2-1 and<br />\ntied for the first in the Centennial<br />\nConference, may have tough time<br />\nhere at Homewood at 1:30 on<br />\nSaturday. The Hopkins defense<br />\nhas stifled opponents with ease so<br />\nfar this season, and the offense<br />\nappears ready to click under<br />\nsenior QB Gary Rupert. Indeed,<br />\nthis may be the Jays finest opportunity to end the eighty-year jinx<br />\nagainst the Bullets.<br />\n<br />\n\f18/SEPTEMBER 30, 1988<br />\n<br />\nDo ou believe in miracles?<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\nRemember the winter of 1980?<br />\nRemember how a group of<br />\nunknown Americans skated their<br />\nhearts out and derailed the Soviet<br />\nhockey juggernaut? Sure you do,<br />\nwho could ever forget? Think<br />\nback to that incredible moment<br />\nwhen the entire country was<br />\nbeaming with pride. Even today,<br />\nyou can turn on a highlight film,<br />\nhear that famous \"do you believe<br />\nin miracles\" line, and find<br />\nyourself smiling from ear to ear.<br />\nDo you recall the tremendous<br />\nfeeling, the satisfaction of beating<br />\nthe Russians at their own game?<br />\nGood. Now, take that feeling and<br />\nput it behind the Iron Curtain,<br />\nright in the heart of Russia,<br />\nbecause it's their turn now.<br />\nThe American basketball team,<br />\nwith all their superstar players and<br />\ntalk of avenging the loss of 1972,<br />\nwere beaten by the Soviet Union<br />\n82-76 last Tuesday night. It was<br />\nnot a fluke either. The Russians<br />\ndominated John Thompson's<br />\ntroops from the opening buzzer,<br />\nhumbling the \"unbeatable\"<br />\nAmericans by controlling the inside<br />\ngame. Now it's the Soviets' turn<br />\nto gloat, for not only did they win<br />\na basketball game, they took back<br />\nthe pride they had lost in Lake<br />\nPlacid. Furthermore, they left all<br />\nof America in a state of disbelief.<br />\nHow could we let this happen?<br />\nThat will be the big question<br />\nthrown around by sports enthusiasts during the next week,<br />\nand as usual the blame will be<br />\nthrown in various directions.<br />\n<br />\n%%<br />\n%<br />\n1<br />\n%k<br />\n<br />\nsome will blame it on poor<br />\nshot selection, others on inexperience, and still others on the<br />\npoor play of Danny Manning.<br />\nVery few, however, will point a<br />\nfinger at John Thompson, and<br />\nthat just might be where a great<br />\ndeal of the blame belongs.<br />\nThere is no denying that<br />\nThompson is a great coach. His<br />\nrecord at Georgetown during the<br />\ndecade<br />\npast<br />\nbeen<br />\nhas<br />\nphenomenal, and he has put<br />\ntogether a tremendous Olympic<br />\nteam in a relatively short period<br />\nof time. What should be questioned, however, is how Thompson<br />\nconducted the trials for the Olympic team and especially his selection of Alonzo Mourning.<br />\nMourning is perhaps one of the<br />\nbrightest prospects to come out of<br />\nhigh school in quite some time,<br />\nand he deserved an invitation to<br />\nthe tryouts. Thompson kept the<br />\nyoungster with the team until<br />\nAugust, making him the last cut<br />\njust before he was to report to his<br />\nfirst college classes. But why was<br />\nhe kept around so long? Sure,<br />\nhe's talented, but the US team<br />\n<br />\nwas already well stocked on the<br />\ninside with Manning, J.R. Reid,<br />\nand David Robinson. Couldn't<br />\nThompson have used Mourning's<br />\nspace on the roster to give outside<br />\nshooters such as Steve Kerr, Rex<br />\nChapman, and Danny Ferry a<br />\nlegitimate shot at making the<br />\nteam? If one of those three had<br />\nmade the team, the Americans<br />\nmay have had an outside threat to<br />\ntake the place of the injured Hershey Hawkins' against the<br />\nRussians.<br />\nWhat was Thompson thinking?<br />\nCould it be that he wanted his top<br />\nrecruit, Mourning, to get some<br />\nexperience against seasonsed<br />\nplayers before coming to<br />\nGeorgetown in the fall? Did he<br />\nsacrifice the good of our national<br />\nbasketball team so that his Hoyas<br />\nmight have a better shot at the<br />\nNational Championship next<br />\nseason?<br />\nWell, these questions and<br />\nothers concerning the loss last<br />\nTuesday will probably go on for<br />\nquite a while. In the end, the lack<br />\nof an outside scoring threat to<br />\ncombat the strong play of the<br />\n<br />\nRussians on the inside cost the<br />\nAmericans a gold medal. All<br />\nacross the United States, people<br />\nwere left with a feeling of shock<br />\nand embarrassment. The Russians were left with a tremendous<br />\npride in their country and a feel-<br />\n<br />\nPat's Pro Picks<br />\nYou would think after going 3-10-1 last week that<br />\nI wouldn't have the guts to do this again.

Grenville Jones set up<br />\nthe score by crossing the ball<br />\nfrom the right side, where Warren Jones flicked it up and<br />\ntowards the goal. Lindenbaum<br />\ntimed the ball's bounce and put it<br />\npast York's keeper.

It seems that only<br />\nabout 25-35 percent of the student<br />\nbody is involved extracurricularly.\"<br />\nTherein lies the problem.<br />\nWhile many Hopkins students<br />\nmay be content to either hide out<br />\nin the MSE or party, weekend<br />\nafter weekend like a Spuds<br />\nMacKenzie on ludes, very few<br />\nare interested enough to initiate<br />\nand participate in on-campus student activities.<br />\nThere's a Catch-22 here.<br />\nBecause we're rarely together as<br />\na community it is difficult to communicate and identify with each<br />\nother effectively. Therefore,<br />\nlong-term solutions for the lack of<br />\ncommunity, such as quad-type<br />\nhousing at least through<br />\nsophomore year and a real student union are never enacted.<br />\nSo, help to consolidate the<br />\nundergraduate presence by moving back on campus during the<br />\nweekends. If a group of people<br />\nwith the collective talent and intelligence of Hopkins undergraduates cannot forge a community, no one can. Go to your<br />\nHoppy Hours, HOP events and<br />\nFunk Nights, because it is in these<br />\nactivities that the seeds of community are planted.

Kyle McCarter on Wednesday<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe meeting was centered upon<br />\na discussion of the future of<br />\nclassics at Hopkins. In the past<br />\nyear, Classics has undergone a<br />\nseries of faculty changes that have<br />\nadversely affected it. Normally a<br />\ndepartment with five full-time<br />\nprofessors, the department has<br />\nnow three full-time professors<br /><br />\nand two visiting professors.<br />\nThe vacancies in the department resulted from the departure<br />\nof one professor and the resignations of two other senior<br />\nmembers whom other universities<br />\nlured away. The three professors<br />\nnotified the department of their<br />\nintentions too late in the academic<br />\nyear for the department to seek<br />\nreplacements, thus leaving the<br />\ndepartment in a precarious position. Interviewing for positions<br />\nbegins each September for the<br />\ncoming academic year.<br />\nAs a solution for this problem,<br />\nthe administration, committed to<br />\ndoing something worthwhile for<br />\nthe department, will consider the<br />\nbest course of action in restructuring the staff.

The Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council<br />\nsponsored the forum, in conjunction with<br />\nthe Office of Residential Life.<br />\nThe annual forum, now in its second<br />\nyear, is designed to raise student<br />\nawareness, according to Panhellenic Council organizer Susan Land. Since approximately one-fourth of women at Hopkins<br />\nunder the age of twenty-five have been sexually harrassed, and because of recent<br />\nfraternity-related harassment incidents at<br />\nHopkins, it is important to get these issues<br />\nout into the open, said Land.<br />\nThe forum began at 7:30 with a mixed<br />\ncrowd of Student Council members,<br />\nstudents, and administrators. Land introduced the forum by giving a definition<br />\nof sexual harassment. \"It is basically unwanted sexual attention that makes people<br />\nfeel like they are in a hostile environment,\" she said.<br />\nShe went on to explain sexual harassment \"myths,\" such as the myth that the<br />\nfemale is always at fault. \"Sexual harassment is a concept of power,\" she said,<br />\nbefore showing a video to show the forum<br />\nparticipants what she meant.<br />\nThe video, made at Hopkins last year,<br />\nwith Hopkins students as actors, focused<br />\non one female student with a problem; she<br />\nhad a chemistry lab two weeks overdue.<br />\nThe video showed the woman talking to<br />\nher TA who told her that her problems<br /><br />\nwere more serious than just one overdue<br />\nassignment. He cited her poor class attendance and invited her to his apartment to<br />\ndiscuss her situation. \"I'll make dinner,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nThe girl tried to arrange an alternate<br />\nmeeting place, but since the TA did not<br />\nhave office hours that week, accepting his<br />\noffer was the only way she would be able<br />\nto talk to him.<br />\nAfter the video, students and Council<br />\nmembers split into three different groups<br />\nto discuss three different scenarios, similar<br />\nto the one shown on video. Each student<br />\nwas handed a type-written scenario, and<br />\nboth IFC and Panhellenic council members<br />\nlead discussions. Two scenarios depicted<br />\nmales forcing females into compromising<br />\npositions, and one involved a female who<br />\nput a male into a compromising position.<br />\nOne question many people raised was,<br />\n\"Where does harassment start?\" Many<br />\nagreed that it starts as soon as a woman<br />\nsays \"no\" to an advance, at which point<br />\nshe is harassed further or verbally abused. Depending on the scenario, some<br />\nthought the harassment began earlier, some<br />\nlater. Nearly everyone agreed that when<br />\na woman says \"no\" she means \"no\" not<br />\n\"yes\" or \"maybe.\"<br />\nIn discussing the scenario in which the<br />\nmale was put in a compromising position,<br />\nparticipants saw the problem of sexual<br />\nharassment differently. One student<br />\nbrought to the forum's attention his belief<br />\nthat an ethics board would not take the<br />\nmale's complaint seriously. However,<br />\nmany disagreed.<br />\nSusan Boswell, director of student ac-<br /><br />\nEly Brown<br /><br />\nSenior Susan Land, an organizer of this year's Male and Female Sexuality Forum,speaks<br />\nto Tim Rosenzweig, president of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, at Wednesday's forum.<br /><br />\ntivities, gave some concluding remarks.<br />\nShe reiterated the group consensus that<br />\n\"no\" means \"no,\" whether spoken by a<br />\nmale or female, and that no one had<br />\ndefinitive answers regarding where blame<br />\nbegins in a case of harassment.<br />\nShe explained that the Sexual Harassment Advisor's Network, drawn from<br /><br />\nstaff, administration, and faculty, is open<br />\nfor anyone who needs help in deciding how<br />\nto handle sexual harassment.

The university says it will<br />\nuse any profits for research.<br />\nWhile start-up funds exist at a<br /><br />\nhandful of universities\u2014<br />\nWashington University has one,<br />\nfor example, and Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity if planning one\u2014the<br />\nHarvard Project is the most<br />\nsignificant yet announced.<br />\nHarvard's decision to create a<br />\nventure fund for its own professors is especially notable<br />\nbecause in 1980 the university rejected a stake in a new company<br />\nthen being formed by one of its<br />\nfaculty members. Such an arrangement, Harvard officials<br />\nfeared, might induce professors<br />\nto sacrifice free inquiry in favor<br />\nof potentially profitable research.<br />\nThat decision reverberated<br />\nthrough the academic community, prompting wide caution about<br />\nlinks between academe and industry.

Because most companies want immediate results,<br />\nseveral \"seminal technologies\"<br />\ndiscovered at Harvard have gone<br />\nundeveloped, Mr. Atkinson said.<br />\nThe project will be managed by<br />\nAndre L.

The<br />\n1980 decision barred the university from holding stock in any<br />\ncompany based on its faculty's<br />\nresearch.

While there was a severe budget<br />\ndeficit, while there would be a shrinking faculty, while 'choices' would have to be made, and<br />\n'priorities' established, and while tuition would<br />\nnecessarily have to increase, students, we were<br />\ntold, would not be 'adversely affected'. Not to<br />\nworry, it was emphasized; the deficit was the<br />\nresult of errors in judgement, however, it was<br />\nnothing that couldn't be sorted out in due time.<br />\nThe acceptance is almost naive in retrospect.<br />\nThe University's mission, is, after all, to<br />\neducate. Accordingly, if the University's cure<br />\nfor a million dollar deficit is to reduce the<br />\nnumber of educators, prioritize departmental<br />\nneeds and choose between them, then the<br />\nsystem and the students are likely to suffer.<br />\nThe University's attrition medicine is particularly troublesome to some of the smaller<br />\ndepartments at Homewood, where the loss of<br />\none or two professors constitutes the loss of a<br />\nsignificant percentage of their total faculty.<br />\nThe Classics Department may be seen as a<br />\nparadigm of this situation. This semester the<br />\nnumber of full time professors decreased from<br />\nfive to three as faculty were lured away by more<br />\nattractive offers from other universities.<br />\nAlthough the problem was corrected somewhat<br />\nwith two visiti-a -rofessors this year, there is<br /><br />\nstill just one tenured professor. Hopkins is<br />\nunable to immediately replace these crucial<br />\nmembers, in large part due to the limitations<br />\nplaced on hiring because of the deficit.<br />\nThe situation is an uncomfortable one. For<br />\nthe department to function, there must be a<br />\nminimum of certain components; if any one of<br />\nthese components is taken away, the structure<br />\nof the department will be adversely affected in<br />\na cascading manner. Without sufficient<br />\nnumbers and quality of professors,(and the<br />\nability to attract them) graduate students are<br />\nunlikely to choose Hopkins' department; with<br />\nneither professors nor graduate students,<br />\nundergraduates are unlikely to major in<br />\nClassics; and finally, without sufficient professors, graduate students, and undergraduate<br />\nmajors, the University risks losing not only the<br />\nlongtime excellent reputation enjoyed by the<br />\nClassics Department, but its overall reputation<br />\nas well.<br />\nFor the time being, however, an air of uncertainty permeates the Classics Department, and<br />\nindeed all the smaller departments. What will<br />\nbe their future within the University? Will they<br />\ncontinue to exist as separate enitities, or will<br />\nthey be merged with other departments with<br />\n'similar interests', an idea suggested by Dean<br />\nArmstrong last spring. And whatever the future<br />\nholds, what can the departments do to maintain their status quo today?<br />\nThe administration would do well to clarify<br />\nits position and reassert its commitment to the<br />\ndepartments. Addressing the problems on an<br />\nad hoc basis only contributes to the general<br />\nuncertainty. And although we are less naive<br />\nnow than a semester ago, we are no less receptive to administrative response.<br /><br />\nJoining the World<br />\nPresident Muller's speech this week to the<br />\nYoung Democrats and College Republicans<br />\nbrought up a particularly nauseating statistic:<br />\nhe estimates that eighty percent of Hopkins<br />\nstudents will not vote in the upcoming elections<br />\nin November.<br />\nStudent Council elections are no stranger to<br />\nthis fact. Many of the people who have sat on<br />\nCouncil this year and in previous years have<br />\nwon their positions in uncontested elections, or<br />\nwith an abysmally low proportions of students<br />\nnot taking the time at (can you believe it) the<br />\nlibrary to jot down a vote and drop it in the box.<br />\nSurprise, surprise, you say. Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates have long been renowned for<br />\ntheir apathetic stance towards anything but a<br />\ngood GPA and an assured chance at future<br />\ncareer successes.<br />\nA primary reason for voter abstention is the<br />\nfeeling that casting a vote makes no difference<br />\nin the outcome. The actual problem with this<br />\ntheory is that en masse neglect of the voting<br />\nstalls leaves a tremendous amount of power in<br />\nthe hands of those who do vote. So, in a sense,<br />\nif you really cared about making a difference,<br />\nyou would take advantage of your statistical<br />\nedge and run to the polls. Even in the unlikely<br />\ncircumstance that record numbers of voters<br />\nheed this gem of advice, it could do no possible harm to have too great a percentage of the<br />\npopulation contributing to the choice of its<br />\nmutual leader.<br />\nSimilarly, with Council elections, it is puzzl-<br /><br />\ning to note that those who yell the loudest about<br />\nour campus life are the very ones who laugh<br />\nwhen you mention taking time out from a busy<br />\nday to vote. In a smaller sphere, with so few<br />\npeople voting, the vote counts even more, and<br />\nhas more impact on things that directly affect<br />\nstudents\u2014student services, most importantly.<br />\nThe campus leaders are, for the most part, those<br />\nwho relay to administrators that which their<br />\nconstituents need.<br />\nParadoxical, too, that the pre-professional<br />\nHopkins student working on an undergraduate<br />\neducation from which he will have to emerge<br />\nand face the tough new world would ignore an<br />\nelection which will have a tremendous effect<br />\non what he faces upon graduation. In all probablility, we will all be establishing our careers<br />\nthen\u2014can we afford not to vote?<br />\nThe bare essential of this issue is as follows:<br />\nlife at Hopkins is a lot of planning of future<br />\nmoves\u2014the pre-professional atmosphere sets<br />\nour sights on goals which we are light-years<br />\naway from acheiving, creating a sort of tunnel<br />\nvision and iack of awareness of the situation<br />\nwhich immediately surrounds us. Being a<br />\n*grown-up means a lot more than living a few<br />\nhundred miles away from your parents, feeding<br />\nyourself, paying bills, and carrying a heavy<br />\nworkload. Accepting responsibility for your actions and your role within society is an essential component of life and must be your ultimate<br />\ngoal.

Everyone wants to<br />\ntoot his own horn, but no one<br />\nwants to get out of his seat and<br />\nhelp out.<br />\nThe first step to getting out of<br />\nthis traffic situation is to accept<br />\nwhat one cannot change.<br />\nHomewood is just one of many<br />\nJohns Hopkins institutions, and<br />\nwe are clearly not the administration's sole concern. It is difficult<br />\nto understand the complaints that<br />\nwe are just a drop in the Hopkins<br />\nbucket. Of course we are. Believe<br />\nit or not, this situation predates<br />\nour enrollment.<br />\nAt the same time, an enterprising Hoppy has a tremendous<br />\namount of freedom to do as he or<br />\nshe pleases. We are hardly under<br />\nanyone's microscope as far as<br />\nfreedom of action goes. A student<br />\ncan design a major, live where he<br />\nlikes (provided that it's not the<br />\ndorms),join any number of campus organizations, and take<br />\ncourses with people who are<br />\npreeminent in their fields.<br />\nGranted, these people are often<br />\nmore interested in their research<br />\nthan in us, but academia is not<br />\nalways your instant TV dinner.<br />\nSometimes, in order to get<br />\nsomething really extraordinary<br />\nout of a class or a professor re-<br /><br />\nquires putting something really<br />\nextraordinary in.<br />\nBut it's true\u2014the undergraduate really has to lobby or at<br />\nleast exert himself in order to get<br />\ninto the majority of such classes<br />\n(although if you aren't willing to<br />\nmake at least some sort of effort,<br />\nyou must have been completely<br />\nmisguided to have decided to<br />\ncome here in the first place). It<br />\nseems that Hopkins basically has<br />\ntwo major things to offer to the<br />\nundergraduate: first, a highpowered faculty that could not<br />\nhave been assembled merely for<br />\nthe benefit of undergraduates<br />\nalone. Second, and this is probably more important than most<br />\nof us would like to admit,<br />\nHopkins' prestige is derived from<br />\nthe collective excellence of our<br />\nuniversity.

The JHU Coalition for a<br />\nFree South Africa has mixed<br />\nfeelings.<br />\nThe most important problem<br />\nremains the fact that Hopkins<br />\ncontinues to invest $44 million in<br />\nSouth Africa-related securities.<br />\nTreasurer Eugene Sunshine has<br />\njust completed a minor divestment of a company that did not<br />\ncomply with the Sullivan Principles, but those \"fair emplyment\" principles are a corporate<br />\nsham made irrelevant long ago.<br />\n(Rev. Sullivan himself renounced them in 1987.)<br />\nIn another action related to<br />\nSouth Africa, it is gratifying that<br />\nthe recent philosophical policy<br />\nshift\u2014supporting shareholder<br />\nvotes against South Africa\u2014<br />\nrecognizes the moral bankruptcy<br />\nof doing business in the land of<br />\napartheid.<br />\nThe Trustees' shareholder<br />\nvotes this year for corporations to<br />\nleave the only country on earth<br />\nwhere racism is constitutionally<br />\nmandated, is far better than<br />\nprevious years' votes, in which<br />\nHopkins supported corporate<br />\nmanagement on every South<br />\nAfrica vote. One year, Hopkins<br />\neven voted to support IBM in its<br />\npolicy of supplying the South<br />\nAfrican government with<br />\nproducts.<br />\nBut opposing a U.S. corporate<br /><br />\npresence in South Africa can be<br />\nmore sincerely backed up by<br />\ndivesting (selling) those companies' stocks.<br />\nHopkins must not be seen as<br />\nsupporting a \"constructive<br />\nengagement' policy with corporations which refuse to see the<br />\nhandwriting on the wall. History<br />\nhas shown that shareholer resolutions on South Africa disinvestment(leaving South Africa) never<br />\ngarner more than 20 percent of<br />\nthe vote.<br />\nSo if Hopkins really wants to<br />\nhave an impact, it is only through<br />\nparticipation in university and<br />\npension fund mass shareholder<br />\nsales that we will send corporations the unequivocal message to<br />\nend their support for the apartheid<br />\ncurrent<br />\nThe<br />\neconomy.<br />\nshareholder strategy favored by<br />\nthe Trustees is clearly an ineffectual cop-out.<br />\nBut this is not surprising. There<br />\nare still more than a dozen<br />\nHopkins Trustees whose employment by companies that do<br />\nbusiness in or with South Africa<br />\nput them in clear conflict of interest on this question. The Coalition renews the call for these<br />\nTrustees to leave the Board and<br />\nthe Hopkins community unless<br />\nthey exercise their moral duty and<br />\nrefrain from further debate and<br />\nparticipation on the divestment<br />\nissue.<br />\nA prime example of a conflict<br /><br />\nof interest is Hopkins' strong ties<br />\nto the Millipore Corporation of<br />\nMassachusettes,<br />\nBedford,<br />\nthrough the directorship in that<br />\ncompany of Hopkins President<br />\n(and Trustee) Steven Muller, and<br />\nthrough other product arrangements. Millipore sold its<br />\nSouth African subsidiary on<br />\nDecember 1, 1985, but the latest<br />\navailable information from<br />\nreliable sources indicates that<br />\nMillipore \"retains a trademark<br />\nagreement with its former South<br />\nAfrican subsidiary., Such a<br />\npolicy is called \"sham disinvestment,\" and Dr. Muller should be<br />\nashamed to participate inits<br />\nformulation.<br />\nIt would be embarrassing to all<br />\nof us if the U.S. Congress, which<br />\nis currently considering comprehensive mandatory sanctions<br />\nagainst South Africa, acts next<br />\nmonth to preempt a strong moral<br />\nstand by our university. This is<br />\nespecially true given the enormous student, faculty and staff interest in this issue, the majority<br />\nsupport for divestment by<br />\nHopkins students, and the fact<br />\nthat many South Africans (including two members of the Tutu<br />\nfaminly and one Mandela) have<br />\ntaken great pains to come to<br />\nHopkins and to graphically<br />\ndescribe to us conditions in their<br />\nhomeland.<br />\nSince 1985, Hopkins has had a<br />\nSee BOND, 10<br /><br />\nTHE MAGIC AND COMEDY OF riallN<br />\n11011 GARNER<br />\nThursday, October 6<br />\n9:00 PM<br />\nArellano Theater<br />\nTickets $2.00<br /><br />\n)0,1<br /><br />\nickets Available at:<br />\nThe Union Desk<br />\nThe Terrace Room<br />\n(5:30-7:00 pm)<br /><br />\nThe Levering Patio<br />\n(12:00 1:00 pm)<br />\nSPONSORED BY THE HOP SPECIAL PROGRAMS COMMITTEE<br /><br />\n\u2022 10/SEPTEMBER 30. 1988<br /><br />\nOpinion<br />\npseudo<br />\nPSEUDO, from 9<br />\nHopkins in undergraduate size,<br />\nalso populated heavily with<br />\ngraduate students and a faculty<br />\ndeeply involved in research. Like<br />\nour campus, it is urban. In a<br />\nrough parallel of our own premed/non-premed split, CMU is<br />\ndivided down the middle into<br />\nwhat they call the Fruits (liberal<br />\nartsies) and the Veggies<br />\n(science/computer types). But<br />\nthere is a much stronger sense of<br />\ncommunity, at least within these<br />\ngroups, than there is at<br />\nHomewood. This, despite the fact<br />\nthat all of their on-campus housing is farther away from campus<br />\nproper than any of ours is.<br />\nThrow into their list of<br />\nnegatives a student union which<br />\nis even more pathetic than ours,<br />\nand appears destined to become<br />\na swimming pool and gymnasium<br />\nin the near future.<br />\nWhy then the better community atmosphere? There would appear to be a two fold explanation.<br />\nMost importantly is an administration that is at least outwardly much more supportive of<br />\nits undergraduates. No doubt this<br />\nhas something to do with the fact<br />\nthat CMU's undergraduate division is much more important in<br />\nproportion to the rest of the<br />\nuniversity than ours. CMU is not<br />\nthe giant international corporation<br />\nthat is Johns Hopkins. But when<br />\na large number of CMU students<br />\nwere arrested en masse by an<br />\noverzealous police department at<br />\na frat party, the administration<br /><br />\ncame down solidly on the side of<br />\nthe students and helped to protect<br />\ntheir rights. It is difficult to imagine such supportive behavior<br />\nfrom the Muller crowd here,<br />\nunless, of course, the arrested<br />\nwere lacrosse players.<br />\nThe primary difference between CMU and Hopkins lies<br />\nelsewhere, in a much more basic<br />\nvein. CMU students are simply<br />\nmore supportive of campus<br />\nevents of the non-fraternity sort.<br />\nmore involved and less apathetic<br />\ntoward their fellow students and<br />\ntheir University. Our basic problem here lies with the students,<br />\nnot solely with administration.<br />\nHopkins boasts some very supportive and effective administrators, who, curiously<br />\nenough, serve as models for other<br />\nuniversities, in particular<br />\nCarnegie Mellon. According to<br />\ntheir admissions department, they<br />\nlook to Johns Hopkins' Student<br />\nActivities department for inspiration. No way, you say.<br />\nAnyone who has tried to<br />\norganize a new student activity at<br />\nHomewood and has encountered<br />\nDr. Susan Kulesa Boswell will<br />\nunderstand why this is true.<br />\nThere are few people at this<br />\nuniversity more positive, helpful<br />\nand encouraging than she. Not<br />\nonly can she help with everything<br />\nfrom planning to funding, but she<br />\ndoes so with an enthusiasm and<br />\nsupportiveness that contrasts with<br />\nthe way undergraduates are<br />\nusually dealt with around here.<br />\nWhen one realizes the services<br />\nwe have at our disposal in Student<br />\nActivities, the lack of community atmosphere does not seem to<br />\nbe something which can be so<br /><br />\neasily blamed on the administration alone.<br />\nDiscussing with some consternation the poor community atmosphere at Hopkins, Dr.<br />\nBoswell said, \"[Student Activities] is here to be responsive<br />\nto the need and interests of<br />\nstudents...we're very flexible and<br />\nvery often able to meet what<br />\nstudents may want to do.\" Dr.<br />\nBoswell also commented on the<br />\nlow level of attendance at many<br />\nSee PSEUDO, 23<br /><br />\nnot cease protesting those investments.

More<br />\nthan a few Hopkins students make<br />\nit part of their Saturday morning<br />\nroutine. Hopkins professors can<br />\nalso be found there dressed in<br />\nshorts and toting canvas bags full<br />\nof their purchases.<br />\nAccording to Professor<br />\nRichard Kagan, the market is \"a<br />\nmarvelous Saturday morning<br />\nfamily outing\" for his three-anda-half year old, who loves \"picking the flowers, touching the<br />\ncrabs, and fingering the fruit.\"<br />\nSophomore Pam Maxwell, her<br />\narms full with sacks of apples,<br />\npeaches, pears, cucumbers, and<br />\nwheat rolls, said she made the<br />\nshort trip this Saturday, \"because<br />\nmy roommate came the last two<br />\ntimes and it's my turn.\"<br />\nMaxwell bought her rolls from<br />\na table set up by Jocelyne's<br /><br />\nBakery, a newly-opened French<br />\nbakery on Greenmount Avenue.<br />\nWhile Jocelyne's offers more<br />\nAmericanized wheat and rye<br />\nrolls, sourdough bread, and fruit<br />\nturnovers, their specialties are<br />\nFrench: croissants (filled and<br />\nplain), brioches, bagettes, and<br />\nvarious pastries.<br />\nUp the way from the Jocelyne's<br />\ntable, Rob and Lucy Wood of<br />\nSproutwood Farm, Glenrock,<br />\nPennsylvania offers freshly baked muffins, tea breads, and pies.<br />\nIf you want zucchini, banana, or<br />\ncarrot breads or blueberry muffins, they are here.<br />\nOn one side of the baked goods<br />\nare dried flower wreaths.

The<br />\nCalifornian Students Association<br />\n(CASA) was started last year by<br />\nCalifornians who felt that not<br />\nenough was done to prepare incoming students from the West<br />\nCoast for the different life at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nOver the summer, CASA<br />\nstudents contacted freshmen in<br /><br />\nCalifornia and helped them<br />\nprepare for the Great Trek,<br />\nanswering questions and giving<br />\nhelpful suggestion. While this has<br />\nbeen the group's only activity so<br />\nfar, there are plans for many<br />\nthings to come.<br />\nBrian Liddicoat, one of the<br />\ngroup's founders and its chief<br />\norganizer, says that aside from<br />\naiding incoming freshmen,<br />\nCASA has two broad goals to<br />\nachieve. The first is to assist<br />\nAlumni, the Western Regional<br /><br />\nEly Brown<br /><br />\nMembers of the California Students Association(CASA)smile for the camera at their first meeting of the year.<br /><br />\nOffice, and the Office of Admissions in recruiting in high<br />\nschools. The idea is that while<br />\nHopkins gains more exposure on<br />\nthe West Coast, the students will<br />\nhave more interaction with the<br />\nalumni and thus be more likely to<br />\nbecome actively involved with<br />\nalumni functions in the years to<br />\ncome. It is also hoped that the<br />\ngreater student involvement in the<br />\nadmissions process will help to<br />\nmake it more bearable for the<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nThe second goal is to sponsor<br />\na variety of social events, or as<br />\nLiddicoat puts it, to promote<br />\n\"year-long frivolity and entertainment through a whole slew of<br />\nmarashinatin' good times!\" Plans<br />\nin the works are for trips on the<br />\nPotomac, to Kings Dominionn,<br />\nand to Baltimore landmarks,\"<br />\nsays Liddicoat. \"Basically, the<br />\nidea is to do what people want to<br />\ndo.\"<br />\nActivities are not only being<br />\nplanned on the East Coast, but for<br />\nthe West Coast as well. Liddicoat<br />\nmentioned that two CASA<br />\nmembers made a trip to Palm<br />\nSprings (the Fort Lauderdale of<br />\nthe west) during Spring Break last<br />\nyear, and thought that similar<br />\nplans might be made this year.<br />\nOther proposed activities for the<br />\nWest Coast include big weekend<br />\nparties and trips to nearby<br />\nMexico.<br />\nLiddicoat is quick to point out<br />\nthat even though the name of the<br /><br />\ngroup implies that it is just for<br />\nCalifornians, CASA is open to<br />\nanyone interested. \"We harbor<br />\nno aims of exclusivity,\" he says.<br />\n(\"When our operations in<br />\nCalifornia have succeeded, we'll<br />\ntry to spread our efforts to the rest<br />\nof the Western United States.\")<br />\nIt is interesting to note that of the<br />\nsixty current members, twothirds are not Californian, and<br />\nover half are not even from the<br />\nWest Coast.<br />\nCASA has no ties with SAC,<br />\nclaiming no need for such affiliation. \"We rely on our own labor,<br />\nour own ingenuity, and our own<br />\nresources,\" Liddicoat says.<br />\n\"Anything else we need, we get<br />\nfrom the Western Regional Office.\" He admits that the group<br />\nowes a lot to Rachel Hendrickson<br />\nand Dr. Longaker in the Western<br />\nRegional Office, as well as to the<br />\nmany alumni in the western<br />\nstates, but maintains that the club<br />\nis still an independent organization, despite its proposed work<br />\nfor Admissions.<br />\nThe group will begin to hold<br />\nregular meetings in the near<br />\nfuture, and invites anyone who is<br />\ninterested to join. \"CASA is<br />\nprincipally a service organization,\" says Liddicoat. \"Our goal<br />\nis to get people to help<br />\nthemselves. Once that happens,<br />\nthere won't be any need for the<br />\nclub. Until then, we'll be using<br />\nwhat we have, doing what we<br />\ncan.\"<br /><br />\ng<br />\nC<br />\nd<br />\nE<br />\no<br />\nC<br />\n)<br />\nti<br />\nfi<br />\ntl<br />\nfi<br />\nd<br />\nN<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\na<br />\nE<br />\nii<br />\nt!<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nrts<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nby Andy Rieser<br />\nPopular culture is perhaps too<br />\nquick to accept the stereotypical<br />\nimage ofjazz as the music of the<br />\neconomically underpriviledged<br />\nand the socially repressed. This<br />\ncan be seen in \"Moscow on the<br />\nHudson,\" Where the typical jazz<br />\nclub is portrayed as a seedy,<br />\nsmoke-filled room.<br />\nThere is no question that jazz<br />\noriginated and developed to a<br />\ngreat extent within the musical<br />\ncircles of the depressed American<br />\ninner-city. Many great jazz musicians from Louis Armstrong to<br />\nMiles Davis were unable to afford<br />\ninstrumental training in their<br />\nchildhood\u2014they relied on the<br />\nscratch recordings of their<br />\nmusical predecessors and constant experimentation and practice<br />\nto achieve their level of mastery.<br />\nIn the 60's, however, the<br />\ngeneral increase in racial<br />\nawareness within universities<br />\nbrought jazz into the musical curriculum. Jazz improvisation was<br />\nthen studied as a bona fide art<br />\nform, an expression of cultural<br />\nand emotional identity. More and<br />\nmore intellectuals began listening, appreciating, and patronizing<br />\njazz artists. The beloved smoke-<br /><br />\nfilled den of iniquity ceased to<br />\nbecome the sole medium for the<br />\njazzmen of the 70's and 80's.<br />\nYuppie-ish, more upscale, night<br />\nclubs sprang up in many<br />\nAmerican cities, including<br />\nBaltimore, a city deceptively rich<br />\nin jazz.

The<br />\ncover charge is between $15 and<br />\n$25.<br />\nOn a much more accessable<br />\nlevel for college students interested in taking in an evening of<br />\njazz is Bertha's Dining Room, at<br />\n734 S.Broadway (327-5795).<br />\nLocated in the heart of quaint<br />\nFells Point, Bertha's has no cover<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\ncharge and no minimum.<br />\npectedly.

Despite the traditional<br />\nrock and roll lifestyle, it's clear<br />\nMetallica aren't a group of empty headed party fiends. They're<br />\nserious about their music and they<br />\nwork damn hard at it. It's also obvious that the issues that their<br />\nsongs address are important to<br />\nthem. Their source material is<br />\nclassic teenage angst: greed,<br />\nfreedom, and hypocrisy. Powerful stuff. Unfortunately, they<br />\ntranslate it all into cliche. With<br />\ntitles like \"Eye of the Beholder\"<br />\nand \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\", it's hard not to wince and<br />\neasier to laugh. Each song is an<br />\nindictment and Metallica is judge,<br />\njury, and executioner. As you<br />\nmight expect, it gets to be a little<br />\nmuch. \"One,\" for example, is a<br />\nballad of sorts about a soldier in<br />\na hospital, all but dead from stepping on a landmine. Surprisingly, it's not the generals who got<br />\nthe poor fellow shot up that get<br />\nMetallica's venom, but rather the<br />\nmedical profession whose<br />\ntechnology keeps the soldier alive<br />\ndespite the fact that he cannot see,<br />\nhear, or feel. It's told first person and describes the horror of<br />\nbeing alone in a sightless,<br />\nsoundless hell.

If they had gotten<br />\njust a few breaks or one big play,<br />\nthey might be 3-0 instead of 0-3.<br />\nBut once again last Friday night,<br />\nthe Blue Jays came up empty and<br />\ndropped their home opener 13-9<br />\nto Fairleigh Dickinson in front of<br />\na crowd of 1,200.<br />\nLate in the third quarter it appeared the gods might finally be<br />\non the Jays' side. Trailing 13-9,<br />\nHopkins put together an impressive drive highlighted by a<br />\nkey 20-yard, third down reception by Brian Hepting. The Blue<br />\nJays drove down to the FDU<br />\n13-yard line, where the drive<br />\nstalled. On a fourth and four,<br />\nquarterback Gary Rupert completed perhaps the most unusual<br />\nand spectacular pass of his career.<br />\nRupert's pass was deflected at the<br />\nline by a Devil defender, but the<br />\nball bounced right back into the<br />\nsenior quarterback's hands, and<br />\nhe scampered six yards to give<br />\nHopkins a first and goal at the<br />\nFDU seven. After Brian Dulin<br />\nwas stopped just short of the end<br />\nzone on the third down, Rupert<br />\nwas once again faced with a<br />\nfourth down about two feet from<br />\nthe goal line. He opted for the<br />\nquarterback sneak.<br />\n\"Gary felt he could get it in and<br />\nhe asked for the call,\" commented Coach Jerry Pfeifer. \"He<br />\nfelt the QB sneak had been open<br /><br />\nBob Nelson<br /><br />\nGary Rupert pitches the ball to Brian Dulin, who rushed for 104 yards on 19 carries.<br /><br />\nall day, and he went in behind<br />\ntwo good linemen.\"<br />\nUnfortunately, a wall of Devil<br />\ndefenders were there to stuff<br />\nRupert and nullify a beautiful<br />\ndrive by the Blue Jays. Hopkins<br />\nnever really got close to the end<br />\nzone again, although Fairleigh's<br />\noffense tried to give them the opportunity. Despite the tremendous play of the Blue Jay defense,<br />\ntwo Hopkins drives in the closing<br />\nminute ended in interceptions,<br />\nand FDU held on to remain<br />\nunbeaten.<br />\nIn the first half, it appeared the<br /><br />\nHopkins offense was finally starting to click under Rupert. After<br />\nthe Devils scored on their opening drive, Brian Dulin took over<br />\nfor the Jays. Ripping through the<br />\nFairleigh defense on several key<br />\nthird down plays, Dulin set up a<br />\ntwo yard TD plunge by Rupert to<br />\ntie the score at seven. Dulin was<br />\nsuperb all day; he demonstrated<br />\nhis form of a year ago by gaining<br />\n104 yards on 19 carries.<br />\nBut those were the final points<br />\nthe offense could generate. The<br />\ndefense once again kept Hopkins<br />\nin the game by scoring a safety<br /><br />\nat the end of the first half after the<br />\nFDU punter fell on an errant snap<br />\nin the end zone. Early in the third<br />\nquarter, the defense finally had a<br />\nbreakdown. After watching his<br />\nquarterback Mike Roedelbronn<br />\nget flushed out of the pocket,<br />\nFDU receiver Dave Van Brunt<br />\ngot free in the end zone for a<br />\n32-yard TD strike to give the<br />\nDevils a 13-9 lead. So once again<br />\nthe Blue Jay defense tried to make<br />\nup for the lack of offense and<br />\ncame up just short.<br />\n\"I believe the offense will<br />\ncome around and reach the level<br /><br />\n4<br />\n11*<br />\n4<br />\n,<br /><br />\nGary Rupert calls the signals in the first half of Friday night's game.<br /><br />\nof the defense soon,\" said senior<br />\nlineback Mike Fenzel. \"They've<br />\nbeen working their tails off in<br />\npractice, and they're beginning to<br />\nmesh as a unit.\"<br />\nIndeed, the offense showed<br />\ngreat potential this week, despite<br />\ntheir inability to put points on the<br />\nboard. The team responded well<br />\nto Rupert's leadership, especially the running attack. If they can<br />\ncut down on the turnovers and get<br />\nsome kind of passing game working they just might start playing<br />\nup to the defense.<br />\nBut the Blue Jays are running<br />\nout of time in the 1988 football<br />\ncampaign. This Saturday's game<br />\nagainst Gettysburg marks the<br />\nbeginning of the most difficult<br />\npart of the Jays' schedule.<br />\nDespite their 0-3 start, the<br />\nveterans on the squad remain extremely optimistic.<br />\n\"If the defense plays up to its<br />\npotential and the offense comes<br />\naround, there is no way we can<br />\nlose those games. This is the best<br />\ndefensive team I've ever played<br />\non,\" said Fenzel.<br />\nNotes: Dulin's 104 yards last<br />\nweek gave him 175 yards on 38<br />\ncarries for the season. He now<br />\nhas 1,368 yards rushing in his<br />\ncareer at Hopkins, moving him<br />\ninto sixth place on the JHU alltime leading rushers list.<br /><br />\nBob Nelson<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nHopkins gricimen hope to end eighty year j<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\njinx<br /><br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\nYou'd have to go back an<br />\nawfully long way, back to the<br />\ndays when the Hopkins football<br />\nschedule included the likes of<br />\nPenn State, to find the last time<br />\nthat the Blue Jays defeated Gettysburg. Going into this Saturday's matchup here at<br />\nHomewood, the Bullets hold a<br />\n11-1-2 series advantage over<br />\nHopkins, with the only loss coming somewhere around 1915.<br />\nLast year, the Bullets explod-<br /><br />\ned for 20 points in the second<br />\nquarter to rout the Jays 30-6. Gettysburg racked up 299 yards on<br />\nthe ground, and most of the backs<br />\nreturn for this season's matchup.<br />\nSenior co-captain Bob Wolfe and<br />\njunior Bob Krokenberger will<br />\nreturn at the halfback spots, while<br />\njunior Mike Rosenberger will<br />\nhandle the fullback responsibilities for the Bullets. Absent,<br />\nhowever, is quarterback Tony<br />\nCampana, who was lost to<br />\ngraduation after leading Gettysburg to a 7-3 record. His<br /><br />\nreplacement is senior Chip Rossi,<br />\na converted defensive back who<br />\nhas struggled so far by completing only 16 of 38 passes for<br />\n209 yards in three games.<br />\nRossi will have an outstanding<br />\nline in front of him, led by potential All-American guard Chris<br />\nKakalec. Kakalec, a six foot, 246<br />\npounder from Madison, New<br />\nJersey anchors an offensive front<br />\nwhich averages around 230<br />\npounds. The Bullets' defense has<br />\nplayed very well so far this<br />\nseason, especially junior<br /><br />\nlinebacker Ron DeLuca, who<br />\nleads the team with 39 tackles(29<br />\nsolo). DeLuca had 13 tackles,<br />\nforced a fumble and recovered<br />\nanother, and had a key interception with just 1:03 remaining to<br />\nsecure last week's 27-19 victory<br />\nover Swarthmore.<br />\nThe Bullets' biggest weapon,<br />\nhowever, may be their<br />\nplacekicker Jerry Mihalick.<br />\nMihalick, a junior, booted a<br />\n41-yarder to defeat Western<br />\nMaryland 17-14, and last week he<br />\nhit from 41 twice and 42 once. In<br /><br />\na close game, Mihalick's foot just<br />\nmight be the deciding factor.<br />\nGettysbutfi,currently 2-1 and<br />\ntied for the first in the Centennial<br />\nConference, may have tough time<br />\nhere at Homewood at 1:30 on<br />\nSaturday. The Hopkins defense<br />\nhas stifled opponents with ease so<br />\nfar this season, and the offense<br />\nappears ready to click under<br />\nsenior QB Gary Rupert. Indeed,<br />\nthis may be the Jays finest opportunity to end the eighty-year jinx<br />\nagainst the Bullets.<br /><br />\n18/SEPTEMBER 30, 1988<br /><br />\nDo ou believe in miracles?<br />\nby Patrick Furey<br />\nRemember the winter of 1980?<br />\nRemember how a group of<br />\nunknown Americans skated their<br />\nhearts out and derailed the Soviet<br />\nhockey juggernaut?

It was<br />\nnot a fluke either. The Russians<br />\ndominated John Thompson's<br />\ntroops from the opening buzzer,<br />\nhumbling the \"unbeatable\"<br />\nAmericans by controlling the inside<br />\ngame. Now it's the Soviets' turn<br />\nto gloat, for not only did they win<br />\na basketball game, they took back<br />\nthe pride they had lost in Lake<br />\nPlacid. Furthermore, they left all<br />\nof America in a state of disbelief.<br />\nHow could we let this happen?<br />\nThat will be the big question<br />\nthrown around by sports enthusiasts during the next week,<br />\nand as usual the blame will be<br />\nthrown in various directions.<br /><br />\n%%<br />\n%<br />\n1<br />\n%k<br /><br />\nsome will blame it on poor<br />\nshot selection, others on inexperience, and still others on the<br />\npoor play of Danny Manning.<br />\nVery few, however, will point a<br />\nfinger at John Thompson, and<br />\nthat just might be where a great<br />\ndeal of the blame belongs.<br />\nThere is no denying that<br />\nThompson is a great coach.

What should be questioned, however, is how Thompson<br />\nconducted the trials for the Olympic team and especially his selection of Alonzo Mourning.<br />\nMourning is perhaps one of the<br />\nbrightest prospects to come out of<br />\nhigh school in quite some time,<br />\nand he deserved an invitation to<br />\nthe tryouts. Thompson kept the<br />\nyoungster with the team until<br />\nAugust, making him the last cut<br />\njust before he was to report to his<br />\nfirst college classes. But why was<br />\nhe kept around so long? Sure,<br />\nhe's talented, but the US team<br /><br />\nwas already well stocked on the<br />\ninside with Manning, J.R. Reid,<br />\nand David Robinson. Couldn't<br />\nThompson have used Mourning's<br />\nspace on the roster to give outside<br />\nshooters such as Steve Kerr, Rex<br />\nChapman, and Danny Ferry a<br />\nlegitimate shot at making the<br />\nteam? If one of those three had<br />\nmade the team, the Americans<br />\nmay have had an outside threat to<br />\ntake the place of the injured Hershey Hawkins' against the<br />\nRussians.<br />\nWhat was Thompson thinking?<br />\nCould it be that he wanted his top<br />\nrecruit, Mourning, to get some<br />\nexperience against seasonsed<br />\nplayers before coming to<br />\nGeorgetown in the fall? Did he<br />\nsacrifice the good of our national<br />\nbasketball team so that his Hoyas<br />\nmight have a better shot at the<br />\nNational Championship next<br />\nseason?<br />\nWell, these questions and<br />\nothers concerning the loss last<br />\nTuesday will probably go on for<br />\nquite a while. In the end, the lack<br />\nof an outside scoring threat to<br />\ncombat the strong play of the<br /><br />\nRussians on the inside cost the<br />\nAmericans a gold medal.

The Hooters are undefeated<br />\non the turf at Homewood field but<br />\nhave lost all of their away games.<br /><br />\nAgainst Haverford in their first<br />\nMAC game, the Jays began aggressively, as their strategy of<br />\nforward passes from the backfield<br />\nto the midfield was successful in<br />\ngetting the ball into Haverford<br />\nterritory, but the Hooters were<br />\nunable to convert any shots into<br />\ngoals.

P.S.<br />\nFred is gone.<br /><br />\nPSEUDO, from 10<br />\nHopkins events and the difficulty in establishing social institutions, saying that, -there seem to<br />\nbe very few Hopkins traditions<br />\nexcept for non-participation...I'm<br />\nlooking for a way to get consistent input from a broader range<br />\nof students about what they would<br />\nlike to see happening at<br />\nHomewood. It seems that only<br />\nabout 25-35 percent of the student<br />\nbody is involved extracurricularly.\"<br />\nTherein lies the problem.<br />\nWhile many Hopkins students<br />\nmay be content to either hide out<br />\nin the MSE or party, weekend<br />\nafter weekend like a Spuds<br />\nMacKenzie on ludes, very few<br />\nare interested enough to initiate<br />\nand participate in on-campus student activities.<br />\nThere's a Catch-22 here.<br />\nBecause we're rarely together as<br />\na community it is difficult to communicate and identify with each<br />\nother effectively. Therefore,<br />\nlong-term solutions for the lack of<br />\ncommunity, such as quad-type<br />\nhousing at least through<br />\nsophomore year and a real student union are never enacted.<br />\nSo, help to consolidate the<br />\nundergraduate presence by moving back on campus during the<br />\nweekends.

Have we created a monster? Is Greenwich<br />\nVillage really ready for quizzes and endless gab about Rotisserie League baseball? Is New<br />\nYork City ready?<br />\nThis quiz is, I hope, easy. It better be. It's an amalgamalamism\u2014no, an amalgal, an amam,<br />\nan agalmagismal, an, er, uh\u2014a collection of fairly random questions about rock, roll, and<br />\nBarry Manilow. Right answers are not difficult to find or even guess. Again, worry not if<br />\nyou don't know them all. Anyone who thinks he has them should consider himself proud.<br />\nEveryone else should submit his answers to the Gatehouse by October 5 at 5 p.m. Barry would<br />\nJump Shout Boogie over that. Even Now. And as you know, the QM Can't Smile Without You.<br />\nResults: Yes, I'm angry, but I'll be subtly peeved. We got two entries, one from a freshman,<br />\none from a junior. Did anybody get lost coming to the Gatehouse? Since that was question<br />\n25, I'll assume that was the reason. The QM ain't happy, folks. I'm forced to give first prize<br />\nto David \"Clubber\" Lang and the posters to Kathryn \"Eyechart\" Ng. The answers, not<br />\nthat anyone but them cares, are: 1) New Engineering Building; 2) near the Hopkins Club;<br />\n3) Look 'em up yourself, weenies; 4) Japan; 5) Kessenich, Morrill, Pietramala; 6) 1586;<br />\n7) HX39.5 .M374 1978; 8) $2; 9) near Gilman Hall; 10) MSE lawn; 11) Economics, for<br />\nnow; 12) UCLA; 13) two; 14)60(420 to Lorne Greene's dog); 15) February; 16) No Doz;<br />\n17) Goucher Shuttle; 18) retake, expulsion; 19) Levering benches; 20) Charles Carroll; 21)<br />\nGoodnow Drive; 22) Get serious, guys; 23) Daniel Coil Gilman; 24) Uncle Miltie; 25) Look<br />\nfor where the BMA drainage system spills out.<br />\nI Don't Know What to Name This Section: I figured out what NEB means.
