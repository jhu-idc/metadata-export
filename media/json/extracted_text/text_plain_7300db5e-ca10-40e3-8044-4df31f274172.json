Once<br />\nmore, after the lapse of a year, the campus will be brightened,<br />\nand the youthful appearance of the freshmen enhanced, by the<br />\ndistinctive black and blue head pieces.<br />\nBut there are other reasons, beside these purely artistic<br />\nones, which make the return to caps a wise policy. Freshmen<br />\nregulations, it is generally admitted, are desirable; and to us<br />\nthe wearing of caps is the most important provision of the<br />\nregulations. The whole aim of the rules which apply each fall<br />\nto the incoming class is- to impress upon them that they are<br />\nno longer all-important high School seniors, but members of<br />\nthe lowest class in college. The cap goes a long way toward<br />\ndoing it. It never serves to increase its wearer's sense of selfimportance or savior Mire; in fact it was designed to make him<br />\nlook as ridiculous as, possible, and the University colors are<br />\nthrown in for good measure.<br />\nIn addition, the caps' serve to develop class solidarity by<br />\nproviding a token by which all that are under the yoke of regulations may recognize their fellow sufferers. And incidently<br />\nthey are valuable in sitigling out to the sophomore his prey.<br />\n_<br />\nFrom what we have said, one might think that we regarded<br />\nthe cap as some kind of a cure-all which may be applied to<br />\nevery failing peculiar to freshmen. That, of course, is absurd.<br />\nOnly associations with undergraduates and professors, over a<br />\nlong period of time can mould a newcomer into a university<br />\nman, or more particularly, a Hopkins man. But regulations<br />\nhave their place, and the cap is an important item. We sincerely hope that President Goodnow will approve the regulations submitted-by- the -Student Council:<br />\n<br />\nA -cord dance- is being inno<br />\nvated at the University of California, and the entrance requirements<br />\nfor the men will be corduroy trousers, the only restriction being<br />\nthat these must be clean.

Although this lays<br />\nto rest some of the problems of next year, it far from settles<br />\nall of them. The newly made reputation for efficiency in drawing up the agreement must be maintained by the adoption of<br />\nbetter methods of enforcing it.<br />\nProbably on account of their very restrictive character,<br />\nat least we hope there is some logical way to explain it, past<br />\nrushing agreements have never been entirely lived up to. Since<br />\nviolations of the spirit of rules have been practically universal,<br />\nthe occasional breaches of the letter have been treated lightly.<br />\nIn some colleges violations of the rushing agreement are<br />\nlooked upon in the same light as violations of the honor system.<br />\nConsequently offenses occur rarely, and when they do, both the<br />\nfraternity and the individual involved suffer serious consequences.<br />\nPossibly the agreement this year is a little easier to keep.<br />\nBut whether it is easy or hard, it is up to the fraternities bound<br />\nby it to regard it as a gentleman's agreement, and it is up to<br />\nthe Board to provide punishment such that if violations do<br />\n- occur, they will not easily be forgotten.<br />\n<br />\nChicago, Illinois.<br />\n<br />\nPayne & Merrill<br />\nCLOTHIERS<br />\nHABERDASHERS<br />\n315 Charles Street North<br />\n<br />\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES<br />\n<br />\nSTEIN BROS. & BOYCE<br />\nEstablished 1853<br />\n<br />\n6 S.

Once<br />\nmore, after the lapse of a year, the campus will be brightened,<br />\nand the youthful appearance of the freshmen enhanced, by the<br />\ndistinctive black and blue head pieces.<br />\nBut there are other reasons, beside these purely artistic<br />\nones, which make the return to caps a wise policy. Freshmen<br />\nregulations, it is generally admitted, are desirable; and to us<br />\nthe wearing of caps is the most important provision of the<br />\nregulations. The whole aim of the rules which apply each fall<br />\nto the incoming class is- to impress upon them that they are<br />\nno longer all-important high School seniors, but members of<br />\nthe lowest class in college. The cap goes a long way toward<br />\ndoing it. It never serves to increase its wearer's sense of selfimportance or savior Mire; in fact it was designed to make him<br />\nlook as ridiculous as, possible, and the University colors are<br />\nthrown in for good measure.<br />\nIn addition, the caps' serve to develop class solidarity by<br />\nproviding a token by which all that are under the yoke of regulations may recognize their fellow sufferers. And incidently<br />\nthey are valuable in sitigling out to the sophomore his prey.<br />\n_<br />\nFrom what we have said, one might think that we regarded<br />\nthe cap as some kind of a cure-all which may be applied to<br />\nevery failing peculiar to freshmen. That, of course, is absurd.<br />\nOnly associations with undergraduates and professors, over a<br />\nlong period of time can mould a newcomer into a university<br />\nman, or more particularly, a Hopkins man. But regulations<br />\nhave their place, and the cap is an important item. We sincerely hope that President Goodnow will approve the regulations submitted-by- the -Student Council:<br /><br />\nA -cord dance- is being inno<br />\nvated at the University of California, and the entrance requirements<br />\nfor the men will be corduroy trousers, the only restriction being<br />\nthat these must be clean.

Although this lays<br />\nto rest some of the problems of next year, it far from settles<br />\nall of them. The newly made reputation for efficiency in drawing up the agreement must be maintained by the adoption of<br />\nbetter methods of enforcing it.<br />\nProbably on account of their very restrictive character,<br />\nat least we hope there is some logical way to explain it, past<br />\nrushing agreements have never been entirely lived up to.
