P.

It is an<br />\nobvious fact, in theory at least, that the rooms in which graduate<br />\nstudents spend most of their time should be comfortably and attractively arranged. In various rooms at the university this is unfortunately not the case, particularly in the Classical Library. In this<br />\nlibrary the atmosphere is usually hot and dry; the books, bound mostly alike, are smeared<br />\nwith dust, and often scattered at will over the centre table, which in itself appears to have<br />\nbeen excavated from some classical town of the past. Good old German texts abound, but<br />\nif<br />\none wants to find modern texts edited in English, he will often have far to go to find , them.<br />\nThe table is littered with books, the chairs are old and uncomfortable. and the whole appearance of the room is not calculated to impress favorably anyone who is thinking of spending<br />\nthree or four years of his life in graduate work. While it is evident that it is easy for things<br />\nto get in this dilapidated condition, it certainly is not necessary. In the Historical Seminary<br />\n,<br />\nfor instance, the conditions are entirely different. This room is attractive. It is well-lighted,<br />\nhas suitable pictures on the walls, is comfortable, and is a place that one may frequent<br />\nwith<br />\nsome pleasure. It is to be regretted that other rooms are not so well taken care of.<br />\nWe suggest that the graduates proceed to institute a campaign towards bringing all the<br />\nseminary<br />\nrooms into better condition. Possibly this does not come in their bailiwick; if not, let<br />\nthem<br />\nconduct a persistent campaign against those who should attend to these more carefully.<br />\nWe think that the university owes it to itself to at least render the seminary<br />\nrooms<br />\nattractive to her students, many of whom come from a distance and have to spend<br />\nmost of<br />\ntheir time amid surroundings which could so easily be improved.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nV y? 213:tpu<br />\nk.<br />\nT is with regret that the NEWS-LETTER Board announces the resignar if<br />\n.. *Tv vvvvvrvir.\u2022 tion of the Chief Editor, Mr. Franklin B. Pedrick, 1909. Mr.<br />\nlir<br />\n*<br />\nPedrick has been at the head of the Board since last May. He has<br />\nr<br />\ny<br />\nbeen<br />\nan editor since his freshman year.<br />\nr ...is<br />\nPi<br />\nr\u2022<br />\nBingo's fame does not rest upon any single chef-d'oevre, such<br />\nv.<br />\nAT,<br />\nas<br />\nformer<br />\nEditor Bernhart's famous Ode to a Welsh Rabbit (which<br />\nI<br />\nv<br />\nr<br />\nbegan<br />\nwith those classic words, \"As for me, melt the cheese for<br />\nAr<br />\n\u2022 rsryvvriinicry \u2022<br />\nmine\"), or such as his successor Mr. Chew's remarkable madrigal,<br />\nk4<br />\n.- Dr pr<br />\n\"Rosy<br />\nRed Lips and Flashing Black Eyes,\" a poem which excited<br />\n<PVIng<br />\nenthusiasm even in the far-off University of Toronto. None such for<br />\nMr. Pedrick. His glory has been won through a steady devotion to duty, rather than through<br />\nflights of genius.<br />\nSeriously speaking, our Chief Editor has been on the job every day and all the time,<br />\nand under his leadership the paper has set a mark which will be difficult for his successors to<br />\nequal. We are very glad that the Board will still have the benefit of his help and advice.<br />\n<br />\nk_z<br />\n<br />\nv<br />\n<br />\nNCE more banquet season approaches apace, and it behooves the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, as has been the custom from time immemorial, to<br />\ngrOtstugszl:::::tf<br />\n4-e<br />\n.<br />\n,<br />\ngive the under classes advice as to the conduct of the affair. This<br />\nyear, however, the stand taken by the authorities as a result of last<br />\nyear's \"deplorable\" (but, oh, how enjoyable) occurrence forestalls<br />\n:s<br />\n:: \u2022<br />\nanything we might have to say in the matter. Consequently, we<br />\n:z<br />\ncan't say, as we'd be tempted to, that we'd like to see the biggest<br />\nzz zz zz zz zz zz zz \u2022<br />\nkind of \"rough-house.\" We must caution the freshmen to attend<br />\n)2<br />\n,<br />\nevery<br />\nclass, and the sophomores to avoid any attempt to promote illii*EN34312142\",<br />\nfeeling, instead of telling them both to \"go git 'em.\" 0,tempora,<br />\n0, mores. But, such is life.<br />\n22<br />\n<br />\n.12<br />\n<br />\nCERTAIN professor in this university declares that, in spite of the<br />\nfact that he has to replace several \"reserved\" books in the library<br />\nevery year, he still retains his faith in human nature. He says so.<br />\nJoking aside, this business of removing books from the reserved<br />\nshelves is getting to be a nuisance. We are proud to boast that<br />\nJohns Hopkins does not need an honor system to prevent cheating at<br />\nexamination, and we forget that it is just as wrong to take a reserved<br />\nbook as to cheat on examinations. A week or two ago a senior<br />\nremoved \"Whittaker's Anatomy,\" a book which is out of print, and<br />\nwhich was wanted by the whole senior class. The average Hopkins<br />\nman seems to think the university is run for his own personal benefit.<br />\n<br />\nConsequent upon Mr. Pedrick's resignation, George W. Corner, 3d, 1904, has been<br />\nelected Editor-in-Chief; J. Hamilton Owens, 1909, Assistant Editor-in-Chief, and G. Ross<br />\nVeazey, 1910, News-Editor. There will be two, or possibly three, vacancies on the Board of<br />\nEditors, which will be filled at Easter. Candidates are advised to start at work now.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nOUT OF SPACE, OUT OF TIME.<br />\n(Continued).<br />\nContrary to our usual custom, I heard<br />\nnothing from Henry Randolph for a week;<br />\nthen I received a note from him, reading as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"The book has come. I have not had time<br />\nto look at it myself; but you come this evening between eight and ten and get it. I may<br />\nnot be there; but it will be in the library.<br />\nGet it; let nothing stop you.\"<br />\nThe book was an account of the siege of<br />\nRunecksberg, by Otho of Brunswick, in the<br />\nsummer and fall of twelve hundred and six; a<br />\nsiege that lasted a little over six months, at<br />\nthe end of which more pressing affairs called<br />\nthe besieger away, and the plucky little town<br />\nwas saved. A monk who had lived through<br />\nthe siege wrote the book, and it was said to<br />\ncontain much that was unknown to the superficial reader of history. It had been but<br />\nrecently found, and my friend, interested in<br />\nold books, had bought it, promising to lend it<br />\nto me. But the last sentence of Randolph's<br />\nnote puzzled me. Why should anything<br />\nhinder me from getting the book? I awaited<br />\nthe evening with impatience.<br />\nAt eight o'clock I was at my friend's apartments. I asked John if his master was in.<br />\nHe said, \"Yes, sir; he has been in all day,<br />\nbut I haven't seen him since this morning,<br />\nsir. He went into his room \u2014the library. you<br />\nknow\u2014and when I took him his dinner, he<br />\nsaid to take it way; he didn't want it. At<br />\nsupper time he didn't say anything. There<br />\nwas no noise at all in there, sir.\"<br />\n\"Could he have gone out?\" I asked.<br />\n\"No, sir. There is only a bolt to fasten<br />\nthe door with on the inside, and that is locked<br />\nnow. Besides, I should have heard him.\"<br />\n''The window?\"<br />\n''Too high.'<br />\n\"I shall knock on the door, then.\" I did<br />\nso, but got no answer. I repeated my knock.<br />\nI called; no response. Then I remembered<br />\nRandolph's words.<br />\n\"John,\" said I, \"I have to get in there.<br />\nThere is something I want, something your<br />\nmaster told me to get;\" and I showed him the<br />\nnote.<br />\n\"Yes, sir; he passed that out under the<br />\ndoor at dinner-time;\" I sent it around to you.<br />\n<br />\nWhat are you going to do, sir; force the<br />\ndoor?\"<br />\nshall have to, I think. Can we do it?''<br />\n''We can try.\"<br />\nThe bolt was not a very strong one, yet it<br />\ndid not yield immediately. After a few minutes, however, we struck the door a sturdy<br />\nblow with our shoulders and it gave way,<br />\nsending us forcibly into the room.<br />\nThe lamp was burning upon the table.<br />\nNear it lay a black, leather-bound book. But<br />\nthe room was empty! Trembling with excitement, I ran into the laboratory, examined<br />\nevery corner of it, and came upon a heap of<br />\nclothes lying on the floor near the workingtable. They included every article of a<br />\nman's indoor attire, save a collar, a tie and a<br />\npair of cuffs, which lay on the table, and a<br />\ncoat, hanging upon a hook close at hand.<br />\nThen I noticed a slight odor of ether which<br />\npervaded the atmosphere about the table, and<br />\nthe awful truth broke slowly upon me. I<br />\nstaggered out to the arm-chair and covered<br />\nmy face with my hands.<br />\n\"Where is he?\" asked John in a whisper.<br />\n\"God knows,\" was all that I could say.<br />\n<br />\nI dismissed John and sat for a half-hour<br />\nwithout moving, thinking. I could not doubt;<br />\nI could not force myself to believe. My mind<br />\nrefused to comprehend; it absorbed slowly the<br />\nincredible facts. Impossibilities had come to<br />\npass and the task of realizing that fact was<br />\nsuddenly thrust upon my brain. Small wonder that I sat there in a semi-comatose state,<br />\ncounting the ticks of the clock and the rapid<br />\nbeating of my heart.<br />\nFinally, in sheer desperation, hoping to<br />\ndivert my mind, I opened at random the book.<br />\nupon the table and tried to read. By mere<br />\nchance, I struck a passage that startled me.<br />\nI re-read it, then went back a few pages to<br />\nget the connection. What. I read follows,<br />\ntranslated in such a manner as to preserve<br />\nthe quaint style of the original.<br />\n\"And so, on the sixth of October, NV hen<br />\nOtho was encamped against the city five<br />\nmonths, did he send unto the citizens of the<br />\ncity two heralds and six trumpets, with pages<br />\nand squires, who offered fair terms and<br />\npromise of pardon to all who had lifted up<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ntheir hand against the Lord Otho. But they<br />\nBut they who met the messengers sent them<br />\nquickly away lest any might hear those terms,<br />\nand their heart grow weak, and they yearned<br />\nto yield them to the foe. And when the citizens heard of the embassy, they grew exceeding glad; for they said, `Doth not Otho grow<br />\naweary of the siege?'\"<br />\n\"And at this same time did a most miraculous and awful thing occur; which showed<br />\nthe wisdom and mercy of God and the cunning<br />\nof the Evil One. For by the former was the<br />\ncity saved from treacherous betrayal; and by<br />\nthe latter was the gulity one saved from the<br />\npunishment of his crime. What I write is<br />\nnot hearsay, neither is it idle report; for I<br />\nwas there, and heard, and saw, and marvelled<br />\nmuch thereat.<br />\n\"As all men know, there leadeth a narrow<br />\npath near to the East gate of the city, which<br />\ndoth end at a wicket of the wall; and here<br />\nwas wont a single guard to stand, who saw<br />\nall who came upon the path ere they came<br />\nwithin three bow-shots of the wall. Nigh<br />\nhim were wont to lie a score of archers to be<br />\nsuminoned from their slumbers in case of<br />\nneed, and to arouse the soldiery to repel whatsoever attack might be directed against that<br />\npart. Yet so hidden is that path that, were<br />\nthe one guard to fail at his post, surely must<br />\nthe whole city fall into the power of the<br />\nenemy.<br />\n\"By the benigh grace of God, it so chanced<br />\nthat the captain of the guard of the East gate<br />\nwalked in the night near to this same wicket<br />\nand beheld, to his wonder and amaze, the<br />\nlonely watch upon the wall signal with his<br />\npartisan down the path, and soon came to his<br />\nears the clank of armored men. In a moment<br />\nhe raised the guard and summoned the defenders, who discovered the wicket open ready to<br />\nadmit the foe. Had they entered, ere the<br />\nnext sun arose Otho had been master of the<br />\ntown, and all its later history been changed.<br />\nBut the plot was checked and its designer<br />\nseized. He was a tall man, and a strong, and<br />\ndid so lay about him with his weapon, that all<br />\nwere held at bay until one cut in under his<br />\nguard and struck him an horrid wound in the<br />\nthigh, whence the blood did spout in such<br />\nabundance that he fell and swooned. Thus<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nwas the city saved by lucky chance and the<br />\ngracious will of God.<br />\n\"The traitor was brought to speedy trial,<br />\nand there did it become known that he was no<br />\nnative of the town, but that he had enrolled<br />\nin the guard a half-year before and had been<br />\na faithful soldier in the siege. But there<br />\nwere many rumors, too, that he practised the<br />\nblack art and had sold his soul to the Evil<br />\nOne. Which was true, as is shown by what<br />\nI shall now set forth.<br />\n\"He offered no excuse for that which he<br />\nhad done, but some say he was heard to mutter, 'I thought it must be so; what is to be<br />\nmust be.' Yet none knew the purport of<br />\nthose mystic words, though many thought it<br />\nwas the summons of the evil spirit to the<br />\nwizard's aid. He was a handsome young<br />\nman, and when he was condemned a wench<br />\nor two looked wistfully at him; but he said<br />\nnaught; he only dropped and fainted once<br />\nmore from loss of blood. Leeches being summoned, they said he must needs die of his<br />\nwound; whereof, the judges decreed he should<br />\nnot be let die, but that he be brought to account that day for his crime. Therefore was<br />\nthe block prepared, the executioner summoned from his lonely house, and the bright<br />\nsword sharpened anew.<br />\n\"I myself and none other went to shrive<br />\nthe wretched man,and he refused all spiritual<br />\naid. He was so weak he could barely sit upright; wherefore, he bade me fetch a drink<br />\nfor him, to be found within his house, which<br />\nwould strengthen him to meet his doom. I<br />\nwent for it and found a blood-red liquor in a<br />\ncrystal vessel, sending forth an odor that<br />\ndazed the brain and made the senses dull. I<br />\ncrossed myself when I laid hold of it, and<br />\nbrought it to the prisoner.

SCHMEISSER.<br />\n<br />\nThe authorities all seem, however, to agree<br />\nthat the Johns Hopkins University was represented by a lacrosse team in the spring of<br />\n1888. They also tell us the Hopkins Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation was found about this time by<br />\nseveral enthusiasts of the game. Whom we<br />\nmay thank for taking this initiative the explorations of the writer have not revealed.<br />\nThe first team was captained by Clinton L.<br />\nRiggs and Williams and managed by George<br />\nC. Morrison. The team was composed of tile<br />\nfollowing players: Cone, goal;\u2022 T. M. Browne,<br />\npoint; C. Watts, cover point; Williams, Hilles<br />\nand Guggenheimer, defense field; Coastes,<br />\ncentres; Riggs, Lanier and McPherson, attack<br />\nfield; Roszel, out home; Morrison, in home.<br />\nGames were played with the Druids, who won<br />\nby a score of 5-1, and with the Pattersons,<br />\nwho were beaten by a score of 6-2. It is -interesting to note that the attack field and the<br />\ndefense field were not subdivided according to<br />\npositions at this time. The work of each man<br />\nwas not exactly outlined as today.<br />\n<br />\nNovember 10, 190S.<br />\n<br />\nThe object of this history is to collect in one<br />\npaper as far as it is possible, all the data that<br />\nis available with reference to the old Indian<br />\ngame of lacrosse as played at Hopkins and at<br />\nthe same time to infuse some flavor into the<br />\narticle by giving such anecdotes and yarns as<br />\nhave been handed down from team to team.<br />\nNow since the only source of information<br />\nfor the writer to consult have been the everfaithful yearly class-book, first known as the<br />\nDebutante, the Medley, the Hopkinsian and<br />\nlater as the Hullabaloo; and the daily papers<br />\nof the times supplemented by such information<br />\nas has been gleaned from the 'old hunkers\"<br />\nwhich have landed in Baltimore from time to<br />\ntime, it is possible that some of the facts may<br />\nnot be accurate and the yarns have taken on a<br />\ndifferent dress as some of them have wandered<br />\nthrough the space of twenty or more years.<br />\n1888.<br />\n<br />\nEvery once in a while there pops up a<br />\nrumor that the Johns Hopkins had a lacrosse<br />\nteam as far back as 1881, but as the writer<br />\nhas so far not been able to gather any definite<br />\ninformation along this line,he is inclined to believe that many of the men who attended the<br />\nuniversity at that time played with the Druid<br />\nTeam and the public thought that as the<br />\n<br />\n1889.<br />\n<br />\nIn the following spring Hopkins was given<br />\na place in the Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse Association made vacant by the resigning of<br />\nHarvard. This happy result was brought<br />\nabout by Morris Brown, our representative at<br />\nthe meeting of the association, and proved to<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nbe a great inducement for the men to work<br />\nfor the team.<br />\nIn passing it may be interesting to note a<br />\nfew facts about the Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation at that time as it is so closely<br />\nrelated to the lacrosse life at our university.<br />\nThis association originally consisted of<br />\nHarvard, Yale and Princeton. After a few<br />\nyears Harvard being generally the loser, withdrew and Yale soon after followed suit, owing<br />\nto the lack of support given its team by the<br />\ncollege. So in the year 1889 as the league<br />\nthen only consisted of Princeton, John Hopkins, Stevens Institute and Lehigh University,<br />\nsent delegates to the convention to ask for<br />\nadmission to the association. Lehigh was<br />\nturned down and Stevens got in by a very<br />\nclose vote; but when it came to Johns Hopkins<br />\nshe was unanimously admitted, which<br />\nnaturally made the boys of that time feel<br />\n\u2018`puffed up with pride.\"<br />\nOur team was captained that year by Brantz<br />\nRoszel and moreover the records tell us that<br />\nit was greatly strengthened by the addition of<br />\nseveral men familiar with the game; but information as to who these men were has not<br />\nbeen left to posterity. Although Johns Hopkins belonged to the association no championship games were played that year, but our<br />\nteam defeated Lehigh University in a pretty<br />\nand sharply-contested practice game by a<br />\nscorce of 6-0. Two other games were played<br />\nthat year; one with the Druids, the other with<br />\na Philadelphia team; they both ended in a tie,<br />\nthe former 3-3, the latter 2-2.<br />\nThe most remarkable thing to us about the<br />\nway the game game was played in 1889 was<br />\nthe long throws used by nearly all the good<br />\nplayers. One of the daily papers report that<br />\nCone made a goal from goal, but to be exact<br />\nthe writer finds that the ball was thrown from<br />\ngoal to the in home who placed it in the net.<br />\nThe first question that presents itself to the<br />\nman who hears this is, was the field shorter<br />\nthan today? The answer to this is given in<br />\nthe words of a player of that time who was<br />\nheard to say, \"the best overhand throwers on<br />\nour team about that time were 'Billy' Hilles,<br />\nS. M. Cone, Stewart Symington and later<br />\nFred. Briggs; their average throw was 100<br />\nyards and they sometimes worked up to 125<br />\nyards, but it was not accurate as they could<br />\n<br />\nnot hit a space of 20 yards every time. Toni<br />\nPenniman used the back-sling,it went further,<br />\nbut with less accuracy. At that time the<br />\ngame was 'high and front' by which we<br />\nmeant put the ball high in front of goal by<br />\nmeans of a long throw, and then the tall<br />\nattack men would mix it up and push it in.\"<br />\nThe team of 1889 lined up as follows:<br />\nS. M. Cone, goal, T. Penniman, point; W.<br />\nS. Hilles, cover point; T. M. Brown, C. S.<br />\nWatts, F. K. Cameron, defense field; Herbert<br />\nFriedenwald, center; B. M. Roszel, P. R.<br />\nMoale, B. B. Lanier, attack field; W. S.<br />\nSymington, G. C. Morrison, homes; William<br />\nK. Williams, substitute; B. M. Roszel, captain; T. M. Brown, manager.<br />\n1890.<br />\nIn the year of 1890 the Lacrosse Team was<br />\nagain captained by Brantz Roszel. It now<br />\nentered upon a new era of its existence, the<br />\nfirst games of the Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation were played. Although the team<br />\nof this year was the strongest put in the field<br />\nby Hopkins up to that time, yet it failed to<br />\nrealize the high expectations of the student<br />\nbody. This we find in the Hofikinsian<br />\nwas due to three reasons: First, of course,<br />\nwas the careful and long-continued abstinence<br />\nfrom training and practice, which has become<br />\nproverbial in Johns Hopkins Athletics; next,<br />\nand we blush to own it, the team had what is<br />\nvulgarly known as \"swell head\" and this,<br />\ntogether with the fine training of the Lehigh<br />\nmen, lost the first game. And then the<br />\numpire. At Bethlehem this much-abused<br />\nmortal had only his Hopkins eye open for<br />\nfouls, and we are bound to admit that our<br />\nbrethren from the Holy City were not slow to<br />\ntake advantage of this infirmity. At Princeton the play was fast and sharp, but again the<br />\nmisguided umpire was all too easily convinced<br />\nthat a goal made with one post down was no<br />\ngoal at all, and \"the day was lost.\"<br />\n\"Many anxious inquiries were made of the<br />\ndepressed members of the team as to the<br />\nprospects of the game with Stevens. Most of<br />\nthem were too tired to walk, but a few of the<br />\nknowing ones succeeded in converting the<br />\nideas of the doubtful into currency at 1-5.<br />\nWhen Stevens made the first goal, a deep<br />\nsigh went up from the already heavily-laden<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhearts of the lacrosse interest on the bleachers;<br />\nbut the pretty stick work and fine team play<br />\nof the home team soon proved the pace too<br />\nfast for the boys from Hopkins, and the<br />\nremainder of the game was but a successful<br />\neffort to run up a higher score than either<br />\nLehigh or Princeton had made against them.<br />\nScore, 13-1.\"<br />\nThe scores between Lehigh and Hopkins,<br />\nand Princeton and Hopkins were in both<br />\ngames 3-2 in favor of our opponents. Why<br />\nthe Hopkinsian does not speak of our victory<br />\nover the University of Pennsylvania the same<br />\nseason to the tune of 10 to 0, I do not understand.<br />\nThe team lined up this year as follows:<br />\nCone, '90, goal; Penniman, '91, point;<br />\nWatts, '90, cover point; T. M. Brown, '91,<br />\nfirst defense; Briggs, '91, second defense;<br />\nStewart, '91, third defense; Friedenwald, '90,<br />\ncentre; Roszel, '89, third attack; Symington,<br />\n'90, second attack; Lanier, '90, first attack;<br />\nSymington, '91, out home; Morrison, '90, in<br />\nhome.<br />\nSubstitutes\u2014R.

Penniman, '91.<br />\n1891.<br />\nNext we come to the year of 1891 when<br />\nJohns Hopkins first fought her way to the<br />\nhead of the Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse Association and won the championship, defeating<br />\nboth Lehigh and Stevens the former by a<br />\nscore of 5-2 and the latter 7-1. We must<br />\nnote that it was this year that Princeton<br />\nresigned from the association and Lehigh was<br />\nelected in her place.<br />\nRoszel was again captain of the Hopkins<br />\nteam and as the authorities tell us deserves a<br />\ngreat deal of credit for organizing a winning<br />\nteam under extremely discouraging conditions. It seems that interest in the game was<br />\nflagging at the university because of the oor<br />\nshowing the team had made the previous<br />\nyear. It was this year that Hopkins made<br />\nher first move towards modern lacrosse instead of making throws the length of the<br />\nfield it was first played to Frederick Briggs in<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nMidfield who was a good man. This gradually<br />\nled to the carrying game of the future.<br />\nThe team which brought the first and now<br />\nsomewhat faded and dust-covered championship lacrosse banner to our gymnasium to<br />\nwait seven years for its mate, was composed<br />\nof the following men:<br />\nJ. F. Mitchell, goal; T. D. Penniman,<br />\npoint; C. Watts, cover point; F. F. Briggs,<br />\nfirst defense; F. Cameron, second defense;<br />\nC. M. Stewart, Jr., third defense; T.

P. Makel, Johns Hopkins<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nT may perhaps seem somewhat venturesome for a strictly undergraduate publication, such as the NEWS-LETTER has become, to offer<br />\nsuggestions to our esteemed fellow -students, the post-graduates, but<br />\nin times of distress a wee sma' voice may not pass unheeded.<br />\nThe post-graduates, we think, should undertake the solving of a<br />\nproblem which is exceedingly important to themselves. It is an<br />\nobvious fact, in theory at least, that the rooms in which graduate<br />\nstudents spend most of their time should be comfortably and attractively arranged. In various rooms at the university this is unfortunately not the case, particularly in the Classical Library. In this<br />\nlibrary the atmosphere is usually hot and dry; the books, bound mostly alike, are smeared<br />\nwith dust, and often scattered at will over the centre table, which in itself appears to have<br />\nbeen excavated from some classical town of the past. Good old German texts abound, but<br />\nif<br />\none wants to find modern texts edited in English, he will often have far to go to find , them.<br />\nThe table is littered with books, the chairs are old and uncomfortable. and the whole appearance of the room is not calculated to impress favorably anyone who is thinking of spending<br />\nthree or four years of his life in graduate work. While it is evident that it is easy for things<br />\nto get in this dilapidated condition, it certainly is not necessary. In the Historical Seminary<br />\n,<br />\nfor instance, the conditions are entirely different. This room is attractive. It is well-lighted,<br />\nhas suitable pictures on the walls, is comfortable, and is a place that one may frequent<br />\nwith<br />\nsome pleasure. It is to be regretted that other rooms are not so well taken care of.<br />\nWe suggest that the graduates proceed to institute a campaign towards bringing all the<br />\nseminary<br />\nrooms into better condition. Possibly this does not come in their bailiwick; if not, let<br />\nthem<br />\nconduct a persistent campaign against those who should attend to these more carefully.<br />\nWe think that the university owes it to itself to at least render the seminary<br />\nrooms<br />\nattractive to her students, many of whom come from a distance and have to spend<br />\nmost of<br />\ntheir time amid surroundings which could so easily be improved.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nV y? 213:tpu<br />\nk.<br />\nT is with regret that the NEWS-LETTER Board announces the resignar if<br />\n.. *Tv vvvvvrvir.\u2022 tion of the Chief Editor, Mr. Franklin B. Pedrick, 1909. Mr.<br />\nlir<br />\n*<br />\nPedrick has been at the head of the Board since last May. He has<br />\nr<br />\ny<br />\nbeen<br />\nan editor since his freshman year.<br />\nr ...is<br />\nPi<br />\nr\u2022<br />\nBingo's fame does not rest upon any single chef-d'oevre, such<br />\nv.<br />\nAT,<br />\nas<br />\nformer<br />\nEditor Bernhart's famous Ode to a Welsh Rabbit (which<br />\nI<br />\nv<br />\nr<br />\nbegan<br />\nwith those classic words, \"As for me, melt the cheese for<br />\nAr<br />\n\u2022 rsryvvriinicry \u2022<br />\nmine\"), or such as his successor Mr. Chew's remarkable madrigal,<br />\nk4<br />\n.- Dr pr<br />\n\"Rosy<br />\nRed Lips and Flashing Black Eyes,\" a poem which excited<br />\n\nenthusiasm even in the far-off University of Toronto. None such for<br />\nMr. Pedrick. His glory has been won through a steady devotion to duty, rather than through<br />\nflights of genius.<br />\nSeriously speaking, our Chief Editor has been on the job every day and all the time,<br />\nand under his leadership the paper has set a mark which will be difficult for his successors to<br />\nequal. We are very glad that the Board will still have the benefit of his help and advice.<br /><br />\nk_z<br /><br />\nv<br /><br />\nNCE more banquet season approaches apace, and it behooves the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, as has been the custom from time immemorial, to<br />\ngrOtstugszl:::::tf<br />\n4-e<br />\n.<br />\n,<br />\ngive the under classes advice as to the conduct of the affair. This<br />\nyear, however, the stand taken by the authorities as a result of last<br />\nyear's \"deplorable\" (but, oh, how enjoyable) occurrence forestalls<br />\n:s<br />\n:: \u2022<br />\nanything we might have to say in the matter. Consequently, we<br />\n:z<br />\ncan't say, as we'd be tempted to, that we'd like to see the biggest<br />\nzz zz zz zz zz zz zz \u2022<br />\nkind of \"rough-house.\" We must caution the freshmen to attend<br />\n)2<br />\n,<br />\nevery<br />\nclass, and the sophomores to avoid any attempt to promote illii*EN34312142\",<br />\nfeeling, instead of telling them both to \"go git 'em.\" 0,tempora,<br />\n0, mores. But, such is life.<br />\n22<br /><br />\n.12<br /><br />\nCERTAIN professor in this university declares that, in spite of the<br />\nfact that he has to replace several \"reserved\" books in the library<br />\nevery year, he still retains his faith in human nature. He says so.<br />\nJoking aside, this business of removing books from the reserved<br />\nshelves is getting to be a nuisance. We are proud to boast that<br />\nJohns Hopkins does not need an honor system to prevent cheating at<br />\nexamination, and we forget that it is just as wrong to take a reserved<br />\nbook as to cheat on examinations. A week or two ago a senior<br />\nremoved \"Whittaker's Anatomy,\" a book which is out of print, and<br />\nwhich was wanted by the whole senior class. The average Hopkins<br />\nman seems to think the university is run for his own personal benefit.<br /><br />\nConsequent upon Mr. Pedrick's resignation, George W. Corner, 3d, 1904, has been<br />\nelected Editor-in-Chief; J. Hamilton Owens, 1909, Assistant Editor-in-Chief, and G. Ross<br />\nVeazey, 1910, News-Editor. There will be two, or possibly three, vacancies on the Board of<br />\nEditors, which will be filled at Easter. Candidates are advised to start at work now.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nOUT OF SPACE, OUT OF TIME.<br />\n(Continued).<br />\nContrary to our usual custom, I heard<br />\nnothing from Henry Randolph for a week;<br />\nthen I received a note from him, reading as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"The book has come. I have not had time<br />\nto look at it myself; but you come this evening between eight and ten and get it. I may<br />\nnot be there; but it will be in the library.<br />\nGet it; let nothing stop you.\"<br />\nThe book was an account of the siege of<br />\nRunecksberg, by Otho of Brunswick, in the<br />\nsummer and fall of twelve hundred and six; a<br />\nsiege that lasted a little over six months, at<br />\nthe end of which more pressing affairs called<br />\nthe besieger away, and the plucky little town<br />\nwas saved. A monk who had lived through<br />\nthe siege wrote the book, and it was said to<br />\ncontain much that was unknown to the superficial reader of history. It had been but<br />\nrecently found, and my friend, interested in<br />\nold books, had bought it, promising to lend it<br />\nto me. But the last sentence of Randolph's<br />\nnote puzzled me. Why should anything<br />\nhinder me from getting the book? I awaited<br />\nthe evening with impatience.<br />\nAt eight o'clock I was at my friend's apartments. I asked John if his master was in.<br />\nHe said, \"Yes, sir; he has been in all day,<br />\nbut I haven't seen him since this morning,<br />\nsir. He went into his room \u2014the library. you<br />\nknow\u2014and when I took him his dinner, he<br />\nsaid to take it way; he didn't want it. At<br />\nsupper time he didn't say anything. There<br />\nwas no noise at all in there, sir.\"<br />\n\"Could he have gone out?\" I asked.<br />\n\"No, sir. There is only a bolt to fasten<br />\nthe door with on the inside, and that is locked<br />\nnow. Besides, I should have heard him.\"<br />\n''The window?\"<br />\n''Too high.'<br />\n\"I shall knock on the door, then.\" I did<br />\nso, but got no answer. I repeated my knock.<br />\nI called; no response. Then I remembered<br />\nRandolph's words.<br />\n\"John,\" said I, \"I have to get in there.<br />\nThere is something I want, something your<br />\nmaster told me to get;\" and I showed him the<br />\nnote.<br />\n\"Yes, sir; he passed that out under the<br />\ndoor at dinner-time;\" I sent it around to you.<br /><br />\nWhat are you going to do, sir; force the<br />\ndoor?\"<br />\nshall have to, I think. Can we do it?''<br />\n''We can try.\"<br />\nThe bolt was not a very strong one, yet it<br />\ndid not yield immediately. After a few minutes, however, we struck the door a sturdy<br />\nblow with our shoulders and it gave way,<br />\nsending us forcibly into the room.<br />\nThe lamp was burning upon the table.<br />\nNear it lay a black, leather-bound book. But<br />\nthe room was empty! Trembling with excitement, I ran into the laboratory, examined<br />\nevery corner of it, and came upon a heap of<br />\nclothes lying on the floor near the workingtable. They included every article of a<br />\nman's indoor attire, save a collar, a tie and a<br />\npair of cuffs, which lay on the table, and a<br />\ncoat, hanging upon a hook close at hand.<br />\nThen I noticed a slight odor of ether which<br />\npervaded the atmosphere about the table, and<br />\nthe awful truth broke slowly upon me. I<br />\nstaggered out to the arm-chair and covered<br />\nmy face with my hands.<br />\n\"Where is he?\" asked John in a whisper.<br />\n\"God knows,\" was all that I could say.<br /><br />\nI dismissed John and sat for a half-hour<br />\nwithout moving, thinking. I could not doubt;<br />\nI could not force myself to believe. My mind<br />\nrefused to comprehend; it absorbed slowly the<br />\nincredible facts. Impossibilities had come to<br />\npass and the task of realizing that fact was<br />\nsuddenly thrust upon my brain. Small wonder that I sat there in a semi-comatose state,<br />\ncounting the ticks of the clock and the rapid<br />\nbeating of my heart.<br />\nFinally, in sheer desperation, hoping to<br />\ndivert my mind, I opened at random the book.<br />\nupon the table and tried to read. By mere<br />\nchance, I struck a passage that startled me.<br />\nI re-read it, then went back a few pages to<br />\nget the connection. What. I read follows,<br />\ntranslated in such a manner as to preserve<br />\nthe quaint style of the original.<br />\n\"And so, on the sixth of October, NV hen<br />\nOtho was encamped against the city five<br />\nmonths, did he send unto the citizens of the<br />\ncity two heralds and six trumpets, with pages<br />\nand squires, who offered fair terms and<br />\npromise of pardon to all who had lifted up<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ntheir hand against the Lord Otho. But they<br />\nBut they who met the messengers sent them<br />\nquickly away lest any might hear those terms,<br />\nand their heart grow weak, and they yearned<br />\nto yield them to the foe. And when the citizens heard of the embassy, they grew exceeding glad; for they said, `Doth not Otho grow<br />\naweary of the siege?'\"<br />\n\"And at this same time did a most miraculous and awful thing occur; which showed<br />\nthe wisdom and mercy of God and the cunning<br />\nof the Evil One. For by the former was the<br />\ncity saved from treacherous betrayal; and by<br />\nthe latter was the gulity one saved from the<br />\npunishment of his crime. What I write is<br />\nnot hearsay, neither is it idle report; for I<br />\nwas there, and heard, and saw, and marvelled<br />\nmuch thereat.<br />\n\"As all men know, there leadeth a narrow<br />\npath near to the East gate of the city, which<br />\ndoth end at a wicket of the wall; and here<br />\nwas wont a single guard to stand, who saw<br />\nall who came upon the path ere they came<br />\nwithin three bow-shots of the wall. Nigh<br />\nhim were wont to lie a score of archers to be<br />\nsuminoned from their slumbers in case of<br />\nneed, and to arouse the soldiery to repel whatsoever attack might be directed against that<br />\npart. Yet so hidden is that path that, were<br />\nthe one guard to fail at his post, surely must<br />\nthe whole city fall into the power of the<br />\nenemy.<br />\n\"By the benigh grace of God, it so chanced<br />\nthat the captain of the guard of the East gate<br />\nwalked in the night near to this same wicket<br />\nand beheld, to his wonder and amaze, the<br />\nlonely watch upon the wall signal with his<br />\npartisan down the path, and soon came to his<br />\nears the clank of armored men. In a moment<br />\nhe raised the guard and summoned the defenders, who discovered the wicket open ready to<br />\nadmit the foe. Had they entered, ere the<br />\nnext sun arose Otho had been master of the<br />\ntown, and all its later history been changed.<br />\nBut the plot was checked and its designer<br />\nseized. He was a tall man, and a strong, and<br />\ndid so lay about him with his weapon, that all<br />\nwere held at bay until one cut in under his<br />\nguard and struck him an horrid wound in the<br />\nthigh, whence the blood did spout in such<br />\nabundance that he fell and swooned. Thus<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nwas the city saved by lucky chance and the<br />\ngracious will of God.<br />\n\"The traitor was brought to speedy trial,<br />\nand there did it become known that he was no<br />\nnative of the town, but that he had enrolled<br />\nin the guard a half-year before and had been<br />\na faithful soldier in the siege. But there<br />\nwere many rumors, too, that he practised the<br />\nblack art and had sold his soul to the Evil<br />\nOne. Which was true, as is shown by what<br />\nI shall now set forth.<br />\n\"He offered no excuse for that which he<br />\nhad done, but some say he was heard to mutter, 'I thought it must be so; what is to be<br />\nmust be.' Yet none knew the purport of<br />\nthose mystic words, though many thought it<br />\nwas the summons of the evil spirit to the<br />\nwizard's aid. He was a handsome young<br />\nman, and when he was condemned a wench<br />\nor two looked wistfully at him; but he said<br />\nnaught; he only dropped and fainted once<br />\nmore from loss of blood. Leeches being summoned, they said he must needs die of his<br />\nwound; whereof, the judges decreed he should<br />\nnot be let die, but that he be brought to account that day for his crime. Therefore was<br />\nthe block prepared, the executioner summoned from his lonely house, and the bright<br />\nsword sharpened anew.<br />\n\"I myself and none other went to shrive<br />\nthe wretched man,and he refused all spiritual<br />\naid. He was so weak he could barely sit upright; wherefore, he bade me fetch a drink<br />\nfor him, to be found within his house, which<br />\nwould strengthen him to meet his doom. I<br />\nwent for it and found a blood-red liquor in a<br />\ncrystal vessel, sending forth an odor that<br />\ndazed the brain and made the senses dull. I<br />\ncrossed myself when I laid hold of it, and<br />\nbrought it to the prisoner. He drank it, and<br />\nrose, and donned a heavy cloak, and went<br />\nwith the guards.<br />\n\u201cNow cometh the strange and awful sequel<br />\nto these events. The soldiers gathered in the<br />\ncourt-yard to see the execution. The traitor<br />\ntottered to the block and laid his head upon<br />\nit. The white staff was broken above his<br />\nhead. I saw the keen blade flash in the sunlight. I heard it strike upon the sounding<br />\nblock. But no dark blood leapt forth; no<br />\nhead rolled in the dust.

SCHMEISSER.<br /><br />\nThe authorities all seem, however, to agree<br />\nthat the Johns Hopkins University was represented by a lacrosse team in the spring of<br />\n1888. They also tell us the Hopkins Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation was found about this time by<br />\nseveral enthusiasts of the game. Whom we<br />\nmay thank for taking this initiative the explorations of the writer have not revealed.<br />\nThe first team was captained by Clinton L.<br />\nRiggs and Williams and managed by George<br />\nC. Morrison. The team was composed of tile<br />\nfollowing players: Cone, goal;\u2022 T. M. Browne,<br />\npoint; C. Watts, cover point; Williams, Hilles<br />\nand Guggenheimer, defense field; Coastes,<br />\ncentres; Riggs, Lanier and McPherson, attack<br />\nfield; Roszel, out home; Morrison, in home.<br />\nGames were played with the Druids, who won<br />\nby a score of 5-1, and with the Pattersons,<br />\nwho were beaten by a score of 6-2. It is -interesting to note that the attack field and the<br />\ndefense field were not subdivided according to<br />\npositions at this time. The work of each man<br />\nwas not exactly outlined as today.<br /><br />\nNovember 10, 190S.<br /><br />\nThe object of this history is to collect in one<br />\npaper as far as it is possible, all the data that<br />\nis available with reference to the old Indian<br />\ngame of lacrosse as played at Hopkins and at<br />\nthe same time to infuse some flavor into the<br />\narticle by giving such anecdotes and yarns as<br />\nhave been handed down from team to team.<br />\nNow since the only source of information<br />\nfor the writer to consult have been the everfaithful yearly class-book, first known as the<br />\nDebutante, the Medley, the Hopkinsian and<br />\nlater as the Hullabaloo; and the daily papers<br />\nof the times supplemented by such information<br />\nas has been gleaned from the 'old hunkers\"<br />\nwhich have landed in Baltimore from time to<br />\ntime, it is possible that some of the facts may<br />\nnot be accurate and the yarns have taken on a<br />\ndifferent dress as some of them have wandered<br />\nthrough the space of twenty or more years.<br />\n1888.<br /><br />\nEvery once in a while there pops up a<br />\nrumor that the Johns Hopkins had a lacrosse<br />\nteam as far back as 1881, but as the writer<br />\nhas so far not been able to gather any definite<br />\ninformation along this line,he is inclined to believe that many of the men who attended the<br />\nuniversity at that time played with the Druid<br />\nTeam and the public thought that as the<br /><br />\n1889.<br /><br />\nIn the following spring Hopkins was given<br />\na place in the Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse Association made vacant by the resigning of<br />\nHarvard. This happy result was brought<br />\nabout by Morris Brown, our representative at<br />\nthe meeting of the association, and proved to<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nbe a great inducement for the men to work<br />\nfor the team.<br />\nIn passing it may be interesting to note a<br />\nfew facts about the Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation at that time as it is so closely<br />\nrelated to the lacrosse life at our university.<br />\nThis association originally consisted of<br />\nHarvard, Yale and Princeton. After a few<br />\nyears Harvard being generally the loser, withdrew and Yale soon after followed suit, owing<br />\nto the lack of support given its team by the<br />\ncollege. So in the year 1889 as the league<br />\nthen only consisted of Princeton, John Hopkins, Stevens Institute and Lehigh University,<br />\nsent delegates to the convention to ask for<br />\nadmission to the association. Lehigh was<br />\nturned down and Stevens got in by a very<br />\nclose vote; but when it came to Johns Hopkins<br />\nshe was unanimously admitted, which<br />\nnaturally made the boys of that time feel<br />\n\u2018`puffed up with pride.\"<br />\nOur team was captained that year by Brantz<br />\nRoszel and moreover the records tell us that<br />\nit was greatly strengthened by the addition of<br />\nseveral men familiar with the game; but information as to who these men were has not<br />\nbeen left to posterity. Although Johns Hopkins belonged to the association no championship games were played that year, but our<br />\nteam defeated Lehigh University in a pretty<br />\nand sharply-contested practice game by a<br />\nscorce of 6-0. Two other games were played<br />\nthat year; one with the Druids, the other with<br />\na Philadelphia team; they both ended in a tie,<br />\nthe former 3-3, the latter 2-2.<br />\nThe most remarkable thing to us about the<br />\nway the game game was played in 1889 was<br />\nthe long throws used by nearly all the good<br />\nplayers. One of the daily papers report that<br />\nCone made a goal from goal, but to be exact<br />\nthe writer finds that the ball was thrown from<br />\ngoal to the in home who placed it in the net.<br />\nThe first question that presents itself to the<br />\nman who hears this is, was the field shorter<br />\nthan today? The answer to this is given in<br />\nthe words of a player of that time who was<br />\nheard to say, \"the best overhand throwers on<br />\nour team about that time were 'Billy' Hilles,<br />\nS. M. Cone, Stewart Symington and later<br />\nFred. Briggs; their average throw was 100<br />\nyards and they sometimes worked up to 125<br />\nyards, but it was not accurate as they could<br /><br />\nnot hit a space of 20 yards every time. Toni<br />\nPenniman used the back-sling,it went further,<br />\nbut with less accuracy. At that time the<br />\ngame was 'high and front' by which we<br />\nmeant put the ball high in front of goal by<br />\nmeans of a long throw, and then the tall<br />\nattack men would mix it up and push it in.\"<br />\nThe team of 1889 lined up as follows:<br />\nS. M. Cone, goal, T. Penniman, point; W.<br />\nS. Hilles, cover point; T. M. Brown, C. S.<br />\nWatts, F. K. Cameron, defense field; Herbert<br />\nFriedenwald, center; B. M. Roszel, P. R.<br />\nMoale, B. B. Lanier, attack field; W. S.<br />\nSymington, G. C. Morrison, homes; William<br />\nK. Williams, substitute; B. M. Roszel, captain; T. M. Brown, manager.<br />\n1890.<br />\nIn the year of 1890 the Lacrosse Team was<br />\nagain captained by Brantz Roszel. It now<br />\nentered upon a new era of its existence, the<br />\nfirst games of the Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation were played. Although the team<br />\nof this year was the strongest put in the field<br />\nby Hopkins up to that time, yet it failed to<br />\nrealize the high expectations of the student<br />\nbody. This we find in the Hofikinsian<br />\nwas due to three reasons: First, of course,<br />\nwas the careful and long-continued abstinence<br />\nfrom training and practice, which has become<br />\nproverbial in Johns Hopkins Athletics; next,<br />\nand we blush to own it, the team had what is<br />\nvulgarly known as \"swell head\" and this,<br />\ntogether with the fine training of the Lehigh<br />\nmen, lost the first game. And then the<br />\numpire. At Bethlehem this much-abused<br />\nmortal had only his Hopkins eye open for<br />\nfouls, and we are bound to admit that our<br />\nbrethren from the Holy City were not slow to<br />\ntake advantage of this infirmity. At Princeton the play was fast and sharp, but again the<br />\nmisguided umpire was all too easily convinced<br />\nthat a goal made with one post down was no<br />\ngoal at all, and \"the day was lost.\"<br />\n\"Many anxious inquiries were made of the<br />\ndepressed members of the team as to the<br />\nprospects of the game with Stevens. Most of<br />\nthem were too tired to walk, but a few of the<br />\nknowing ones succeeded in converting the<br />\nideas of the doubtful into currency at 1-5.<br />\nWhen Stevens made the first goal, a deep<br />\nsigh went up from the already heavily-laden<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nhearts of the lacrosse interest on the bleachers;<br />\nbut the pretty stick work and fine team play<br />\nof the home team soon proved the pace too<br />\nfast for the boys from Hopkins, and the<br />\nremainder of the game was but a successful<br />\neffort to run up a higher score than either<br />\nLehigh or Princeton had made against them.<br />\nScore, 13-1.\"<br />\nThe scores between Lehigh and Hopkins,<br />\nand Princeton and Hopkins were in both<br />\ngames 3-2 in favor of our opponents. Why<br />\nthe Hopkinsian does not speak of our victory<br />\nover the University of Pennsylvania the same<br />\nseason to the tune of 10 to 0, I do not understand.<br />\nThe team lined up this year as follows:<br />\nCone, '90, goal; Penniman, '91, point;<br />\nWatts, '90, cover point; T. M. Brown, '91,<br />\nfirst defense; Briggs, '91, second defense;<br />\nStewart, '91, third defense; Friedenwald, '90,<br />\ncentre; Roszel, '89, third attack; Symington,<br />\n'90, second attack; Lanier, '90, first attack;<br />\nSymington, '91, out home; Morrison, '90, in<br />\nhome.<br />\nSubstitutes\u2014R.

Penniman, '91.<br />\n1891.<br />\nNext we come to the year of 1891 when<br />\nJohns Hopkins first fought her way to the<br />\nhead of the Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse Association and won the championship, defeating<br />\nboth Lehigh and Stevens the former by a<br />\nscore of 5-2 and the latter 7-1. We must<br />\nnote that it was this year that Princeton<br />\nresigned from the association and Lehigh was<br />\nelected in her place.<br />\nRoszel was again captain of the Hopkins<br />\nteam and as the authorities tell us deserves a<br />\ngreat deal of credit for organizing a winning<br />\nteam under extremely discouraging conditions. It seems that interest in the game was<br />\nflagging at the university because of the oor<br />\nshowing the team had made the previous<br />\nyear. It was this year that Hopkins made<br />\nher first move towards modern lacrosse instead of making throws the length of the<br />\nfield it was first played to Frederick Briggs in<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nMidfield who was a good man. This gradually<br />\nled to the carrying game of the future.<br />\nThe team which brought the first and now<br />\nsomewhat faded and dust-covered championship lacrosse banner to our gymnasium to<br />\nwait seven years for its mate, was composed<br />\nof the following men:<br />\nJ. F. Mitchell, goal; T. D. Penniman,<br />\npoint; C. Watts, cover point; F. F. Briggs,<br />\nfirst defense; F. Cameron, second defense;<br />\nC. M. Stewart, Jr., third defense; T.
