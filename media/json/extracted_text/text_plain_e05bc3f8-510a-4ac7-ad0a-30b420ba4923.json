Yet Heist<br />\nexpained that housing costs were<br />\ndealt with as a totality and that<br />\nfunds distributed for a particular<br />\napartment building were not<br />\nnecessarily derived from the rent<br />\ncharged in that building.<br />\nHeist remarked that since<br />\nsonic of these buildings had been<br />\npaid for. funds accruing from<br />\ntheir rents could end up<br />\nearmarked for capital<br />\nimprovements on other buildings.<br />\nHe added that since the \"dorms<br />\nare in reasonably good shape\"any<br />\nprofit made on them was<br />\nimmediately invested in<br />\nmaintenance and improvement of<br />\n<br />\nSavitz announces SC objectives<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBy ALAN HIRSCH<br />\nand<br />\nALLEN SHORT<br />\nStudent Council consideration<br />\nof the proposed Code on Student<br />\nRights and Disciplinary<br />\nProcedures is now slated for<br />\nTuesday, Council President<br />\nAndrew Savitz disclosed this<br />\n\u2022<br />\nweek.<br />\nSavitz said late last week the<br />\ncouncil would not consider the<br />\ncontroversial conduct code, and<br />\nwould \"drop it like a hot<br />\npotato.\"<br />\nBut he announced at<br />\nTuesday's Council meeting. the<br />\nfirst of the year, that the measure<br />\nmight be put to a vote next week<br />\nin an effort to finalize negative<br />\nCouncil ientiment on the<br />\nproposal.<br />\nHomewood Vice-President<br />\nGeorge Benton has agreed to<br />\nabandon plans for implementing<br />\nthe measure if it fails to gain<br />\nCouncil support.<br />\nAbsorbed<br />\nIn other Council business, SC<br />\nVice-President and Student<br />\nActivities Committee chairman<br />\nJohn Colmers announced last<br />\nweek's Jonathan Edwards<br />\nOrientation concert lost<br />\napproximately $2800.<br />\nThe loss will be absorbed by<br />\nthe Council, Colmers said, but<br />\n<br />\nwill prohibit SC sponsorship of<br />\nfuture \"big name\" concerts. He<br />\nsaid the Edwards performance<br />\nwas one of a string of<br />\nunsuccessful concerts in recent<br />\nyears, which have convinced both<br />\nhe and Savitz that inexpensive<br />\nlocal talent concerts are the only<br />\nfinancially feasible ones at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIn addition to consideration of<br />\nthe proposed conduct code, the<br />\nCouncil will soon examine a<br />\nnumber of academic proposals'<br />\nrecently recommended by Savitz,\u2022<br />\nincluding a call for ABC-no credit<br />\ngrading and a more extensive<br />\npass-fail option.<br />\nFreshmen Elections<br />\nElections for Freshman<br />\nStudent Council representatives<br />\nwill probably be held the last<br />\nweek in September or the first<br />\nweek of October, according to<br />\nSavitz.<br />\nThe election of the three<br />\nrepresentatives will take place<br />\nconcurrently with the election of<br />\na freshman class president,<br />\nvice-president, secretary, and<br />\ntreasurer.

The<br />\nHomewood, purchased two years<br />\nago is the most recent addition to<br />\nthe University holdings.<br />\nAccording to Heist, the<br />\nUniversity's philosophy is that<br />\neach housing complex should<br />\nsubsidize itself, as far as possible.<br />\nThus, if \"housing makes a profit<br />\nin some area, we keep it [for use<br />\nin another area],\" Heist stated.<br />\nWhile declining to give any<br />\nfigures.

Authored by the Council on Student Personnel<br />\nAssociations in Higher Education, it seriously questions the<br />\nlegality of grade reporting procedures, financial need analysis<br />\nmethods, and mandatory residence requirements now in effect<br />\nat many colleges and universities, including Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nC.A.MPITS<br />\nFASHIONS<br />\n<br />\nIt is thus distressing to learn that nearly three months<br />\nfollowing the report's publication, the University, according to<br />\nEllery Woodworth, Special Assistant to President Muller, \"has<br />\nnot had the occassion to interpret the new Maryland statute<br />\n(lowering the age of majority to 8) for purposes here, legal or<br />\nadministrative.\"<br />\nThat administrative concern over the lowered age of majority<br />\nhas to date facused upon the serving of alcoholic beverages in<br />\nthe Student Union indicates either failure to keep abreast of<br />\ncurrent and more important implications of the law, or a<br />\nreluctance to consider those implications until court suits<br />\nrender su ch action expedient.<br />\nEquall,y disturbing is Dean of Students Robert J.<br />\nFitzpatrick's assertion that Hopkins's private status will in some<br />\nway enable the University to adapt more easily to the changes<br />\nwhich are bound to be wrought by a serious examination of the<br />\nlaw's implications. The inherent thrust of his statement is that<br />\nprivate colleges and universities are not as bound to legal<br />\ninterpretations of statutes as public schools.<br />\nWe strongly urge University officials to give more serious<br />\nconsideration to the report and to the Maryland stature before<br />\nFitzpatrick's reasoning is challenged in court.<br />\n<br />\nno surprise<br />\nIt didn't really come as much of a surprise to find out that<br />\nHopkins had hired another official without consulting any<br />\nstudents. but the fact that the new official is Homewood's<br />\ndirector of financial aid makes the situation even worse.<br />\nAlthough C. Wayne Hood, the man who is to take over the<br />\nfinancial aid post in a few weeks, is apparently well-qualified for<br />\nthe job. after seven years experience in the field, the fact<br />\nremains that no student was ever consulted or even given a<br />\nchance to meet the candidate, according to Student Council<br />\nPresident Andrew W.

While it is true that summer is the slack<br />\nseason for admissions personnel, and probably the only period<br />\nWhen university financial aid and admissions officials have time<br />\nto conduct interviews and consider job applications. the<br />\nHopkins community could have been informed in May that the<br />\nUniversity was about to start looking for a new financial aid<br />\ndirector and been asked for its suggestions. Although the<br />\nGoucher- Hopkins Committee on Increased Cooperation met<br />\nalmost exclusively during the summer months, both institutions<br />\nwere able to find a student willing to spend the summer here<br />\nand serve on the committee.

Sure, I<br />\nreturned home, and had to face a<br />\nperiod of adjustment\u2014again\u2014but<br />\nafter a few weeks everything<br />\nseemed back to normal once again.<br />\nMy construction job began the<br />\nfirst week in July. I didn't get the<br />\njob because of my charm, good<br />\nlooks, skill, or guts. I got it because<br />\nI knew Carlo Santucri, who<br />\nmarried Alsi Santucri, daughter of<br />\nNicki Santucri, founder of Santucri<br />\nContruction Co. Municipal and<br />\nPrivate Contractors, Stokie, Ill.<br />\nThose Dagos stuck together. My<br />\nvague title as \"Engineering<br />\nAssistant\" on the sewer job would<br />\nmean that I had to lift between<br />\nfour and five tons of bricks a day,<br />\neach day for seven weeks. I soon<br />\nfound that \"Engineering Assistant<br />\nwas synonomous with \"crud-doer.\"<br />\nIn that case I'd have to learn to<br />\nlove working upwards of eight<br />\nhours a day in the summer heat.

I found a mentor in<br />\norganize a mild \"reunion\" to see a sixty-year old dude named Ed<br />\nhow the \"rigors\" treated old who could accurately describe<br />\nfriends. I must admit that a year anyone in ten words or less. Ed<br />\ncertainly produced some budding didn't have much in the way of<br />\nbeauties. It might have been nice education, but as Twain said, \"I<br />\nto help some of them blossom over never let schooling interfere with<br />\nmy education.\" Ed will be<br />\nthe summer. Oh, well.<br />\nThe first few days at home were employed at $2./hr. until he<br />\na rush, what with seeing all the old decides to quit, or dies, whichever<br />\nbuddies and de-tuning, etc. But comes last. Kind of makes you<br />\nsomehow I didn't feel at home think of the value of a college<br />\nanymore in Suberbia. A year at education.<br />\nAnother man whom I admired<br />\ncollege had, I'm afraid to say,<br />\nopened my eyes a bit. I just didn't dearly was Ray. Ray was a<br />\nfeel a part of all the Cadillacs and thalidomide dude with only half a<br />\ncountry clubs. The \"beautiful left arm and boasted, with<br />\npeople\" seemed so distant, so modesty, of having an eighth grade<br />\nempty. I wasn't ready for another education.

I<br />\nbade her congratulations, and<br />\nreceived an informal invitation to<br />\nher wedding, which would be in<br />\nthree to five years. Needless to say,<br />\nI was quite floored by this last<br />\nwork on the status of our<br />\nrelationship, but at least now I was<br />\nabsolutely sure of where I stood<br />\nwith Jan, after enduring a nebulous<br />\nrelationship before.<br />\nMy job ended August 17, which<br />\nwas also the first day I overslept.<br />\nBy then all my buddies had begun<br />\nto return to their respective<br />\nuniversities. I was to drive my<br />\nbuddy Russ back to DePaul<br />\n(Greencastle, Indiana) the<br />\nfollowing Thursday. I returned to<br />\nChicago from Wisconsin where I<br />\nhad passed several days. That was<br />\nWednesday night. I went to Russ'<br />\nto see how he wanted to spend his<br />\nlast night in,the Big City. A movie<br />\nwas out of the question. We were<br />\nboth so beat that the simple<br />\ndarkness of any theatre would have<br />\nlulled us to sleep. But the crux of<br />\nour friendship lies in the fact that<br />\nwe are the original pimpsters, so<br />\nwe had to devise a suitable farewell<br />\npimp for the entire Windy City.<br />\nWe would get dressed up.<br />\nCostume-like. Halloween. In the<br />\n<br />\nmiddle of August. So his mother<br />\nhelped us dig around his house for<br />\nawhile and came q with a Mickey<br />\nMouse hat and shirt complete with<br />\nthe floor length tail. One rubber<br />\nmonster mask, a Navy Lieutenant's<br />\ndress coat, two party hats and<br />\nsome party favors. I wore the<br />\nmouse suit, Russ the coat and<br />\nmask and we both were off to<br />\ndowntown Chicago to have favors<br />\nravage the streets and bring joy to<br />\neveryone we met.<br />\nThe first guy we met at Sixty<br />\nmph on the Kennedy Expressway<br />\ndriving into Avango. It was eleven<br />\nat night when he glanced at the car<br />\nnext to him\u2014and proceeded to<br />\nveer into the next lane, cutting off<br />\na car or two. We chuckled at that<br />\nPimp No.l. We drove through<br />\ndowntown a while, for once trying<br />\nto set stop at each red light so we<br />\ncould smile at the lucky person<br />\nwho was so fortunate as to pull up<br />\nnext to us. We finally parked<br />\nacross from the Chicago River so<br />\nwe could jaunt down the busy<br />\nstreets in our pimp garb.<br />\nThe reactions we received were<br />\nnot all surprising. Most people<br />\nwould see us and laugh until a<br />\nmashed Russ grunted at them,<br />\nupon which they would run.<br />\nOthers tried to ignore us<br />\ncompletely, dismissing us as<br />\naverage midnight perverts. More<br />\nthan a few old ladies and couples<br />\nmade a deliberate and visible effort<br />\nto find the other side of the street<br />\nbefore we crossed their path. One<br />\ncarload of people kept following us<br />\naround the block beeping their<br />\nhorn. They might have been<br />\nperverts, too, but for their smiles<br />\nand laughs. The run-in with the<br />\npolice was inevitable. Their first<br />\nquestion was \"Where is the party?\"<br />\nAfter I .told them the<br />\noccasion\u2014Russ' last night, we<br />\ntalked for awhile and when one of<br />\nthem found out that I was a<br />\npre-med at Johns Hopkins\u2014a<br />\nfuture doctor--he could take no<br />\nmore and urged his partner to<br />\nspeed off before he suffered more.<br />\nWe did visit one restaurant, a<br />\nfavorite for some late night coffee.<br />\nAgain, people were quite shocked<br />\n<br />\nRichard Waring<br />\nFred Slone<br />\nB.

Following a<br />\ntransitional period \u2022 during the<br />\nsummer, Scott took over the<br />\nreins of the Athletic Center on a<br />\nfull time basis August 29.<br />\n\"I'm really enjoying it,\" said<br />\nScott of his new role, and after a<br />\npair of full and active weeks he<br />\nremains undaunted by his<br />\nincreased responsibilities.<br />\nThe Athletic Department at<br />\nHopkins is hardly unfamiliar<br />\nterritory to Scott, who has been<br />\nan integral part of the coaching<br />\nstaff here for almost twenty<br />\nyears. His relationship with the<br />\ndepartment dates back even<br />\nearlier to his days as an active<br />\nundergraduate in the class of<br />\n1952. While a student at<br />\nHopkins, Scott was, captain of<br />\nboth the football and lacrosse<br />\n<br />\nteams. Moreover, he was elected<br />\nPresident of the Senior Class,<br />\nheaded the Lettermen's Club,<br />\nand was a member of Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa. In his senior year<br />\nhe won an honorable mention<br />\nAll-American lacrosse player and<br />\nco-captained the South Squad in<br />\nthe 1952 North-South All-Star<br />\ngame.<br />\nScott then spent two years<br />\nwith the Army as an officer and<br />\ninstructor in the Ranger School.<br />\nIn 1954 he returned to Hopkins<br />\nand began an illustrious career as<br />\nthe varsity lacrosse coach. In that<br />\ncapacity he has guided six<br />\nHopkins' tens to the National<br />\nChampionships and produced 40<br />\nfirst-team All-Americans. In<br />\naddition, he has received the<br />\nMorris Touchstone Trophy as the<br />\nLacrosse Coach of the Year for<br />\nhis efforts in 1965, 1968, and<br />\n1972.<br />\nWhile not concerned with the<br />\nlacrosse season, the new Athletic<br />\nDirector has also coached Blue<br />\nJay squads in soccer, basketball,<br />\nand wrestling for varying lengths<br />\nof time.<br />\nAs the Athletic Director, Scott<br />\nintends to continue the many<br />\n<br />\nprograms initiated by former<br />\nDirector Turner and institute<br />\nsome of the ideas his predecessor<br />\nwas unable to see carried out.<br />\nCommenting on the timing of<br />\nhis promotion, Scott considers<br />\nhimself \"fortunate to move into<br />\nthe job at a time when the<br />\nschool's Administration is giving<br />\nsuch solid support to the Athletic<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\nDean of Students Robert J.<br />\nFtizpatrick, who has ultimate<br />\nresponsibility for the Athletic<br />\nCenter and its program, admitted<br />\nthat the support was long<br />\noverdue.<br />\n\"The impetus for a better<br />\nprogram came when [President<br />\nSteven] Muller was appointed,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\n\"The Blue Ribbon Committee<br />\nreport proposed making the<br />\nAthletic Center a more vital focal<br />\npoint of the campus and the new<br />\nadministration has acted with<br />\nthis intent.\"<br />\nScott is taking this mandate to<br />\nheart and intends to increase the<br />\nstudent usage of the major extra<br />\ncurricular facility currently on<br />\ncampus. \"There will be some<br />\nchanges in the operation of the<br />\n<br />\nAthletic Director Robert Scott<br />\ncenter, with the emphasis on<br />\nmeeting the needs of all who use<br />\nthe facility,\" he said.<br />\n\"We are anxious to hear of any<br />\ncomments in an effort to keep<br />\nclose contact with the users so<br />\nthat we may keep ahead of any<br />\nproblems and make the necessary<br />\nadjustments.\"<br />\nAnother reason for the<br />\noptimism of Scott's outlook is<br />\nthe condition of the athletic staff<br />\nhe inherits.

Once this initial<br />\nself-determination has been<br />\nmade, the division members<br />\nthemselves will establish criteria<br />\n<br />\nfor membership and will<br />\ndetermine the rules and<br />\nregulations to be followed by<br />\nschools competing in their<br />\ndivision.

At this level<br />\nthe overall athletic program will<br />\nbe best served in terms of the<br />\nrelative quality of competition<br />\noffered.<br />\nThe reorganization of the<br />\nNCAA follows years of<br />\ndissatisfaction with the<br />\nregulation of competition by the<br />\nAssociation. Three levels of<br />\ncompetitive intensity have been<br />\nin evidence for years, but as late<br />\nas January of this year, official<br />\nproposals for dealing with.the<br />\nproblems the problems refused to<br />\nrecognize this fact.<br />\nCollege Division<br />\nOriginally, the NCAA<br />\nconsidered all schools on a par<br />\nand maintained a single set of<br />\nregulations for competitive and<br />\nlegislative purposes. By the mid<br />\n<br />\n1950's smaller schools began a<br />\nseparate competitive program in<br />\nwhat came to be known as the<br />\nCollege Division. This grew out<br />\nof a committee of smaller schools<br />\nthat began meeting at the annual<br />\nconventions to discuss problems<br />\nthat affected schools that did not<br />\nhave the large budgets of the<br />\nmajor powers. Soon after the<br />\nCollege Division was formalized,<br />\na full slate of championships was<br />\noffered.<br />\n\"Fish or Fowl\"<br />\nWith two sets of<br />\nchampionships offered, the<br />\nnation's schools had to identify<br />\nin which division they were<br />\ncompeting for each sport. By the<br />\nearly sixties, the NCAA decreed<br />\nthe \"Fish or Fowl\" rule, which<br />\nmade schools enter their whole<br />\nathletic program in one division<br />\nor the other. This ruling caused<br />\nheadaches for schools that were<br />\nstrong in some sports while weak<br />\nin others. Further troubles arose<br />\nas the lure of the various national<br />\n<br />\ntitles increased the recruiting<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nSeveral attempts to resolve the<br />\ndifficulties have proven fruitless<br />\nthrough the years. The basic<br />\npositions of the three levels of<br />\nschools have been impossible to<br />\nresolve in a two division<br />\narrangement. Major powers<br />\nfavored restrictive rules to<br />\neconomize the expenses of<br />\nrecruiting, while the minor<br />\npowers with money to spend<br />\ndesired a free hand in their<br />\nefforts to join the major powers.<br />\nMeanwhile the small schools<br />\ndeplored the aggressive recruiting<br />\natmosphere spawned by the<br />\nothers, but were not in favor of<br />\nrestrictive rules that would run<br />\ncounter to their more relaxed<br />\n-ecruiting situations.<br />\nWith the advent of the new<br />\nhree division proposal, these<br />\nproblems appeared to be<br />\nsmoothed out and the NCAA<br />\nSpecial Convention approved it<br />\noverwhelmingly.<br />\n<br />\nTicket plan announced<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nThe Athletic Department<br />\nannounced a new policy with<br />\nregard to the admission to<br />\nfootball games this year.<br />\nEffective immediately,<br />\nEmployees of the University will<br />\nalso be given the privilege of<br />\nfree admittance to Homewood<br />\nField athletic events.<br />\nAs in the past, full time Johns<br />\nHopkins students will be admitted<br />\nto home football games on their<br />\nregular University ID cards.

Heist added that part<br />\nof the concern over discrepancies<br />\nmight be due to the fact that<br />\nHomewood residents must<br />\nfurnish their apartments and pay<br />\nfor utilities.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nHeist adamantly denies any<br />\nnotion that rent discrepancies at<br /><br />\nHomewood were being used to<br />\npay for maintenance<br />\nand<br />\nimprovement costs on other<br />\nuniversity housing. Yet Heist<br />\nexpained that housing costs were<br />\ndealt with as a totality and that<br />\nfunds distributed for a particular<br />\napartment building were not<br />\nnecessarily derived from the rent<br />\ncharged in that building.<br />\nHeist remarked that since<br />\nsonic of these buildings had been<br />\npaid for. funds accruing from<br />\ntheir rents could end up<br />\nearmarked for capital<br />\nimprovements on other buildings.<br />\nHe added that since the \"dorms<br />\nare in reasonably good shape\"any<br />\nprofit made on them was<br />\nimmediately invested in<br />\nmaintenance and improvement of<br /><br />\nSavitz announces SC objectives<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nBy ALAN HIRSCH<br />\nand<br />\nALLEN SHORT<br />\nStudent Council consideration<br />\nof the proposed Code on Student<br />\nRights and Disciplinary<br />\nProcedures is now slated for<br />\nTuesday, Council President<br />\nAndrew Savitz disclosed this<br />\n\u2022<br />\nweek.<br />\nSavitz said late last week the<br />\ncouncil would not consider the<br />\ncontroversial conduct code, and<br />\nwould \"drop it like a hot<br />\npotato.\"<br />\nBut he announced at<br />\nTuesday's Council meeting. the<br />\nfirst of the year, that the measure<br />\nmight be put to a vote next week<br />\nin an effort to finalize negative<br />\nCouncil ientiment on the<br />\nproposal.<br />\nHomewood Vice-President<br />\nGeorge Benton has agreed to<br />\nabandon plans for implementing<br />\nthe measure if it fails to gain<br />\nCouncil support.<br />\nAbsorbed<br />\nIn other Council business, SC<br />\nVice-President and Student<br />\nActivities Committee chairman<br />\nJohn Colmers announced last<br />\nweek's Jonathan Edwards<br />\nOrientation concert lost<br />\napproximately $2800.<br />\nThe loss will be absorbed by<br />\nthe Council, Colmers said, but<br /><br />\nwill prohibit SC sponsorship of<br />\nfuture \"big name\" concerts. He<br />\nsaid the Edwards performance<br />\nwas one of a string of<br />\nunsuccessful concerts in recent<br />\nyears, which have convinced both<br />\nhe and Savitz that inexpensive<br />\nlocal talent concerts are the only<br />\nfinancially feasible ones at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIn addition to consideration of<br />\nthe proposed conduct code, the<br />\nCouncil will soon examine a<br />\nnumber of academic proposals'<br />\nrecently recommended by Savitz,\u2022<br />\nincluding a call for ABC-no credit<br />\ngrading and a more extensive<br />\npass-fail option.<br />\nFreshmen Elections<br />\nElections for Freshman<br />\nStudent Council representatives<br />\nwill probably be held the last<br />\nweek in September or the first<br />\nweek of October, according to<br />\nSavitz.<br />\nThe election of the three<br />\nrepresentatives will take place<br />\nconcurrently with the election of<br />\na freshman class president,<br />\nvice-president, secretary, and<br />\ntreasurer. The three<br />\nrepresentatives and the class<br />\npresident will serve on the<br />\nStudent Council. \u2022<br />\n\"We'll probably stage a<br />\npreliminary election to narrow<br />\nthe field, and a second election<br /><br />\nother University housing.<br />\nAs Heist explained, the current<br />\nrent system is based on the rents<br />\ncharged at the Bradford<br />\napartments. \"With each building<br />\nthat was added,\" he noted. \"the<br />\nrents in the new Building were<br />\nequated with those of equivalent<br />\nunits at the Bradford.\"<br />\n\"The rent structure (for a<br />\nparticular building) was not<br />\nset-up to cover the costs of the<br />\nbuilding,\" he added.<br />\nUniversity housing presently<br />\nconsists of McCoy and Wolman<br />\nHalls, the Bradford and<br />\nHomewood Apartments, and the<br />\ndormitory complexes. The<br />\nHomewood, purchased two years<br />\nago is the most recent addition to<br />\nthe University holdings.<br />\nAccording to Heist, the<br />\nUniversity's philosophy is that<br />\neach housing complex should<br />\nsubsidize itself, as far as possible.<br />\nThus, if \"housing makes a profit<br />\nin some area, we keep it [for use<br />\nin another area],\" Heist stated.<br />\nWhile declining to give any<br />\nfigures. Heist would say that last<br /><br />\nUniversity uncertain<br />\non 18-yr. old majority<br /><br />\nAndrew W.

Authored by the Council on Student Personnel<br />\nAssociations in Higher Education, it seriously questions the<br />\nlegality of grade reporting procedures, financial need analysis<br />\nmethods, and mandatory residence requirements now in effect<br />\nat many colleges and universities, including Hopkins.<br /><br />\nC.A.MPITS<br />\nFASHIONS<br /><br />\nIt is thus distressing to learn that nearly three months<br />\nfollowing the report's publication, the University, according to<br />\nEllery Woodworth, Special Assistant to President Muller, \"has<br />\nnot had the occassion to interpret the new Maryland statute<br />\n(lowering the age of majority to 8) for purposes here, legal or<br />\nadministrative.\"<br />\nThat administrative concern over the lowered age of majority<br />\nhas to date facused upon the serving of alcoholic beverages in<br />\nthe Student Union indicates either failure to keep abreast of<br />\ncurrent and more important implications of the law, or a<br />\nreluctance to consider those implications until court suits<br />\nrender su ch action expedient.<br />\nEquall,y disturbing is Dean of Students Robert J.<br />\nFitzpatrick's assertion that Hopkins's private status will in some<br />\nway enable the University to adapt more easily to the changes<br />\nwhich are bound to be wrought by a serious examination of the<br />\nlaw's implications. The inherent thrust of his statement is that<br />\nprivate colleges and universities are not as bound to legal<br />\ninterpretations of statutes as public schools.<br />\nWe strongly urge University officials to give more serious<br />\nconsideration to the report and to the Maryland stature before<br />\nFitzpatrick's reasoning is challenged in court.<br /><br />\nno surprise<br />\nIt didn't really come as much of a surprise to find out that<br />\nHopkins had hired another official without consulting any<br />\nstudents. but the fact that the new official is Homewood's<br />\ndirector of financial aid makes the situation even worse.<br />\nAlthough C. Wayne Hood, the man who is to take over the<br />\nfinancial aid post in a few weeks, is apparently well-qualified for<br />\nthe job. after seven years experience in the field, the fact<br />\nremains that no student was ever consulted or even given a<br />\nchance to meet the candidate, according to Student Council<br />\nPresident Andrew W. Savitz. Since the matter of financial aid is<br />\nxxx<br />\na 'wax v_ic\\x\u2018wcky .xxxxczyctavAt..9xNe. aue.tcttN .<br /><br />\nbrought into the selections process or informed that such a<br />\nprocess was underway.<br />\ncv,er<br /><br />\nJohn R. Riina, director of admissions and financial aid, and<br />\nthe official who will be Mr. Hood's immediate superior, was<br />\nperfectly candid yesterday in saying that the interviewing and<br />\nselections process took place during the summer, when few<br />\nstudents are on campus. While it is true that summer is the slack<br />\nseason for admissions personnel, and probably the only period<br />\nWhen university financial aid and admissions officials have time<br />\nto conduct interviews and consider job applications. the<br />\nHopkins community could have been informed in May that the<br />\nUniversity was about to start looking for a new financial aid<br />\ndirector and been asked for its suggestions. Although the<br />\nGoucher- Hopkins Committee on Increased Cooperation met<br />\nalmost exclusively during the summer months, both institutions<br />\nwere able to find a student willing to spend the summer here<br />\nand serve on the committee. With only a little effort, the<br />\nAdmissions office could have found a few students to talk to<br />\nabout applicants for the financial aid position.<br /><br />\nletters<br />\n, to the editor<br />\nVulgar braggadocio and loving sister<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn reference to your editorial of<br />\nSept. 7 entitled \"A Foster Child?\"<br />\nlet me say first that the Hopkins<br />\nclassroom is certainly a vital<br />\nnecessity in the academic world.<br />\nGod knows you need something to<br />\nkeep you busy between lacrosse<br />\ngames. Imagine how educational it<br />\nwould be for us Goucher girls to<br />\nhave Hoppies--cute, live little<br />\nHoppies with their dirty toenails<br />\nand fraternity tee-shirts--sitting<br />\n'right beside us in class. Not that I<br />\nhave anything against studying<br />\nwith Hopkins men. The first time<br />\n\u2022one approached me in the Goucher<br />\nlibrary and blurted: \"ATO needs<br />\ni you! Ho-ho-ho. Need a ride<br />\nSaturday night?\" I knew a merger<br />\nwith Hopkins would be a<br />\nscintillating experience.<br />\nYou referred to Hopkins'<br />\nworld-wide reputation and I quite<br />\nagree with you there. A friend of<br />\nmine recently received actual<br />\nacademic credit for vacationing in<br />\nEurope and later boasted that he<br />\nwas graduating in three years. With<br />\nsuch scholarly standards, I am<br />\namazed it took him that long.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nHopkins men may have high<br />\nCollege Boards and a capacity to<br />\nabsorb things quickly\u2014indeed,<br />\nthey hold their beer even better<br />\nthan the nice boys up at<br />\nDartmouth--but let's not confuse<br />\nthat with academic potential. Your<br />\nbabble about SAT scores leads me<br />\nto believe that you have not<br />\nencountered the surveys which<br />\nconclude there is little correlation<br />\nbetween high SATs and future<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nSo, little brother, don't<br />\nunderestimate your loving sister.<br />\nYou will find she is your equal.<br /><br />\nBefore I knew it there were those dreaded reminders in all the magazines!<br />\nBy JEFF McERLEAN<br />\nI knew it was summer when I<br />\nfumbled back to Hollander after<br />\nDr. Gryder's chemistry final and<br />\nheard all the dorm stereos aimed<br />\ndown the quad playing Alice<br />\nCooper's \"School's Out.\" But I<br />\ncouldn't believe that tomorrow<br />\nheld no anxieties, no assignments<br />\ndue, no classes. School was out, at<br />\nleast by dinner that day it felt as<br />\nthough an insuperable weight had<br />\nbeen lifted from my back.<br />\nThat was Thursday.<br />\nMy own celebration included<br />\nmixing my whole collection of<br />\ntwenty-five tobaccos together,<br />\nsome cognac (courtesy of<br />\nHomecoming '73) and smoking the<br />\nwhole batch. Later on it was off to<br />\nMarguerita's to drink screwdrivers<br />\n(courtesy of Homecoming '73)<br />\nuntil five in the morning.<br />\nMy good buddy Russ drove in<br />\nfrom Chicago the next morning,<br />\nearly, like five-thirty. Hadn't seen<br />\nhim since Christmas, so after initial<br />\nhellos and a can of Coors beer I<br />\ngave him a sunrise tour of the Hop.<br />\nThe morning rays are a special<br />\ntreat. Ask any of the all-nighter<br />\nset.<br />\nDonovan<br /><br />\nRoom<br /><br />\npl,ai o<br /><br />\nuntil<br /><br />\nmidmorning; then enjoyed a free<br />\nlunch courtesy of Prophet Foods<br />\n(they didn't give a damn by that<br />\ntime, anyway.)<br />\nTours of beautiful Bawlamer<br />\nand D.C. were in order. Playing<br />\ntourist in Washington is fun,<br />\nespecially when the sun is out and<br />\nthe panhandlers are not. We did<br />\nthe entire monument circuit, made<br />\nGeorgetown, the Capitol steps<br />\n(have you ever seen the beautiful<br />\nbronze door to the Capitol? There<br />\njust behind the \"No Visitors<br />\nAllowed\" sign?), etc. etc. Back to<br />\nBaltimore by midnight for some<br />\nlate night thrills at Poe's grave.<br />\nEdgar didn't want to show himself<br />\nthat night, but the cemetery was<br />\ngreat fun nonetheless.<br />\nOn Sunday I bade farewell to<br />\nthe Hop and Marguerita and left<br />\nBaltimore for good, or at least<br />\nuntil September. It was somewhat<br />\nironic that it was raining and<br />\nmuggy on that last day just as it<br />\nhad when I first arrived in<br />\nBaltimore only a school-year<br />\nbefore. In fact, it was almost<br />\npoetic.<br />\nAnnapolis was Closed<br />\nNow Russ drove out to fetch me<br />\nso we could have a little trip home,<br />\na sort of de-tuning from the rigors<br />\nof academia. Annapolis was quaint,<br />\nbut closed (it's Sunday),<br />\nAssateague was beautiful, but wet.<br />\nThe Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel<br /><br />\nwas most tedious, but I sat on a<br />\nhill in Denver and contemplated a<br />\nRocky Mountain sunset over a can<br />\nof Coors, the problem suddenly<br />\nbecame less serious. Sure, I<br />\nreturned home, and had to face a<br />\nperiod of adjustment\u2014again\u2014but<br />\nafter a few weeks everything<br />\nseemed back to normal once again.<br />\nMy construction job began the<br />\nfirst week in July. I didn't get the<br />\njob because of my charm, good<br />\nlooks, skill, or guts. I got it because<br />\nI knew Carlo Santucri, who<br />\nmarried Alsi Santucri, daughter of<br />\nNicki Santucri, founder of Santucri<br />\nContruction Co. Municipal and<br />\nPrivate Contractors, Stokie, Ill.<br />\nThose Dagos stuck together. My<br />\nvague title as \"Engineering<br />\nAssistant\" on the sewer job would<br />\nmean that I had to lift between<br />\nfour and five tons of bricks a day,<br />\neach day for seven weeks. I soon<br />\nfound that \"Engineering Assistant<br />\nwas synonomous with \"crud-doer.\"<br />\nIn that case I'd have to learn to<br />\nlove working upwards of eight<br />\nhours a day in the summer heat. I<br />\ndid.<br />\nMy friend Bill and I integrated<br />\nthe contr,uction job. Out of thirty<br />\nwere<br />\nreltilvi nanan 01 oiacK.<br />\nlarmly as well. It was a neat rinclUle<br />\nof the night entrance, but my sister Throughout the duration of the<br />\nhung up the phone on the police job\u2014seven weeks\u2014I read Mark<br />\nonly after she was sure it was only Twain's Life on the Mississippi.<br />\nme, a soldier of sorts returning For those of you who will ever<br />\nundertake a new job or come into<br />\nhome from the war at 34th and<br />\ncontact with people, Twain's work<br />\nCharles.<br />\nTalking to Ma and Pa and kissing is a must\u2014it is a lesson in taking<br />\nmy two sisters took care of things with as large a grain of salt<br />\nanother two hours, but I had to get as necessary, written by a man who<br />\nsome sleep in my own trusty bed, enjoyed a happy life for it. For<br />\nthose of you who do not fit in any<br />\ncat at my side.<br />\nof the above categories, read it<br />\nBlooming Things<br />\nI never did get to meet all the anyway.<br />\nThe human experience I enjoyed<br />\npeople I wanted to over the<br />\nsummer, but did manage to was invaluable. I found a mentor in<br />\norganize a mild \"reunion\" to see a sixty-year old dude named Ed<br />\nhow the \"rigors\" treated old who could accurately describe<br />\nfriends. I must admit that a year anyone in ten words or less. Ed<br />\ncertainly produced some budding didn't have much in the way of<br />\nbeauties. It might have been nice education, but as Twain said, \"I<br />\nto help some of them blossom over never let schooling interfere with<br />\nmy education.\" Ed will be<br />\nthe summer. Oh, well.<br />\nThe first few days at home were employed at $2./hr. until he<br />\na rush, what with seeing all the old decides to quit, or dies, whichever<br />\nbuddies and de-tuning, etc. But comes last. Kind of makes you<br />\nsomehow I didn't feel at home think of the value of a college<br />\nanymore in Suberbia. A year at education.<br />\nAnother man whom I admired<br />\ncollege had, I'm afraid to say,<br />\nopened my eyes a bit. I just didn't dearly was Ray. Ray was a<br />\nfeel a part of all the Cadillacs and thalidomide dude with only half a<br />\ncountry clubs. The \"beautiful left arm and boasted, with<br />\npeople\" seemed so distant, so modesty, of having an eighth grade<br />\nempty. I wasn't ready for another education. But during the first<br />\nidentity crisis or period of week I met him, he was helping me<br />\nadjustment just yet, so when Lee lift some boards and he cautioned<br />\nme to be careful with the freaking<br />\ncalled up and asked if I wanted to<br />\ngo to Denver for a few days, the<br />\nthings, for' he loves life too much<br />\nto lose it.<br />\nanswer was \"Sure.\" The drive out<br /><br />\nis well worth the $5.25 toll, but be<br />\nsure to stop at one of the islands to<br />\nabsorb the true beauty and awe of<br />\nwhat man has wrought and what<br />\nnature has permitted. Virginia had<br />\nalready bloomed a month before,<br />\nbut was all lush and verdant for us<br />\nanyway. One of the most beautiful<br />\nsunsets on record must have been<br />\non the James River near<br />\nJamestown on Monday May 21.<br />\nThe skyline drive is a must for the<br />\navid driver, or serious thinker who<br />\njust wants to sit in an Appalachian<br />\ngrove looking over the rolling hills,<br />\nthe rural hamlets. More roads<br />\n(spelled a-d-v-e-n-t-u-r-e-s) are<br />\nfound on Route 60 through the<br />\nmining communities of West<br />\nVirginia. Southern Ohio is almost<br />\nas nice, but then the hills fall<br />\ndown, the land spreads out, and<br />\nthe corn starts growing in Indiana.<br />\nFour in the Morning<br />\nWe finally made Chicago at tour<br />\nthe next Saturday morning. Russ<br />\njust had to bid a suitable farewell<br />\nto a girl in Indianapolis. That took<br />\ntwo days.<br />\nIt was almost sunrise when we<br />\nbroke into my second-floor<br />\nbedroom only after waking my St.<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nLionel Gossman<br /><br />\nh4-1EH IOaf Kul<br /><br />\nE CS1<br />\ntBLLAA<br /><br />\ncgs's!<br /><br />\n'TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS ENERGY CRISIS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK . .<br /><br />\nc(ixt.rart,c_gerL, 1 was<br />\nwe<br /><br />\ninuuseslifirt with tan,<br />\nblowing The little inflatable fan in<br />\nand out. Russ was tagging behind<br />\nme, disregarding any connection<br />\nbetween he and myself.<br />\nSummer's End<br />\nThe next day we packed him up<br />\nand cruised off to Greencastle.<br />\nMy next and last week was<br />\nlethargic and depressing. All my<br />\ngood friends had returned to<br />\nschool, though Lee came back<br />\nfrom summer camp right before I<br />\nleft. There was not a hell of a lot<br />\nof excitement like anticipation of<br />\ncollege like last summer. I haci<br />\nbeen there before. Nevertheless,<br />\nwhen I left my home August 30,<br />\ncar full of crud, I could not help<br />\nbut grow somewhat excited.<br />\nAhead, I knew, was another year, a<br />\nbig year, sophomore year at the<br />\nHop. Organic chemistry, checking<br />\nout the freshman girls, rekindling<br />\nold friendships.<br />\nBut the car broke down just east<br />\nof NW Stockton, Pa. That's two<br />\nhundred and fifty miles from 34th<br />\nand Charles. I hoped it wasn't an<br />\nomen of the year ahead. My<br />\nparents were more than happy to<br />\ndrive out from Chicago, shuttle me<br />\nto Baltimore.<br />\nI'm glad that the running, the<br />\nhassles, the insecurity of freshman<br />\nyear are over.

By the third week I<br />\nwas pulling the twenty-hour day<br />\ntrick, but I had to: I didn't sweat<br />\nthrough my whole freshman year<br />\nat college so I could do blank all<br />\nsummer. Had to move.<br />\nI had an interesting experience<br />\nAugust 1, an experience that all<br />\n\"eligible\" young bachelors must<br />\nhave sometime.

She is six feet tall but<br />\n4\"); and<br />\nshe'll deny it (I'm 5'113/<br />\nwhat's more, she's intelligent (she<br />\nplays bridge) and witty. But last<br />\nAugust 1, after \"Mary Poppins\"<br />\nand during a hot pastrami<br />\nsandwich, I asked her if she'd make<br />\nit to sunny Baltimore this year.<br />\nShe asked me if I remembered a<br />\ntalk we'd had Thanksgiving, but I<br />\nwas tired and could only vaguely<br />\nremember some of the reassuring<br />\nstatements we'd made to each<br />\nlay<br />\n\"-Nx-rj;<br />\n'<br />\n-I1111111\"<br />\nr1 VY11.11<br />\n11116g\u2014<br />\nreassierances, but suddenly she<br />\ntook a deep breath, smiled, and<br />\nwhispered \"I'm engaged.\" I'm glad<br />\nI wasn't drinking anything then,<br />\ncause I would have made a mess. I<br />\nbade her congratulations, and<br />\nreceived an informal invitation to<br />\nher wedding, which would be in<br />\nthree to five years. Needless to say,<br />\nI was quite floored by this last<br />\nwork on the status of our<br />\nrelationship, but at least now I was<br />\nabsolutely sure of where I stood<br />\nwith Jan, after enduring a nebulous<br />\nrelationship before.<br />\nMy job ended August 17, which<br />\nwas also the first day I overslept.<br />\nBy then all my buddies had begun<br />\nto return to their respective<br />\nuniversities. I was to drive my<br />\nbuddy Russ back to DePaul<br />\n(Greencastle, Indiana) the<br />\nfollowing Thursday. I returned to<br />\nChicago from Wisconsin where I<br />\nhad passed several days. That was<br />\nWednesday night. I went to Russ'<br />\nto see how he wanted to spend his<br />\nlast night in,the Big City. A movie<br />\nwas out of the question. We were<br />\nboth so beat that the simple<br />\ndarkness of any theatre would have<br />\nlulled us to sleep. But the crux of<br />\nour friendship lies in the fact that<br />\nwe are the original pimpsters, so<br />\nwe had to devise a suitable farewell<br />\npimp for the entire Windy City.<br />\nWe would get dressed up.<br />\nCostume-like. Halloween. In the<br /><br />\nmiddle of August. So his mother<br />\nhelped us dig around his house for<br />\nawhile and came q with a Mickey<br />\nMouse hat and shirt complete with<br />\nthe floor length tail. One rubber<br />\nmonster mask, a Navy Lieutenant's<br />\ndress coat, two party hats and<br />\nsome party favors. I wore the<br />\nmouse suit, Russ the coat and<br />\nmask and we both were off to<br />\ndowntown Chicago to have favors<br />\nravage the streets and bring joy to<br />\neveryone we met.<br />\nThe first guy we met at Sixty<br />\nmph on the Kennedy Expressway<br />\ndriving into Avango. It was eleven<br />\nat night when he glanced at the car<br />\nnext to him\u2014and proceeded to<br />\nveer into the next lane, cutting off<br />\na car or two. We chuckled at that<br />\nPimp No.l. We drove through<br />\ndowntown a while, for once trying<br />\nto set stop at each red light so we<br />\ncould smile at the lucky person<br />\nwho was so fortunate as to pull up<br />\nnext to us. We finally parked<br />\nacross from the Chicago River so<br />\nwe could jaunt down the busy<br />\nstreets in our pimp garb.<br />\nThe reactions we received were<br />\nnot all surprising. Most people<br />\nwould see us and laugh until a<br />\nmashed Russ grunted at them,<br />\nupon which they would run.<br />\nOthers tried to ignore us<br />\ncompletely, dismissing us as<br />\naverage midnight perverts. More<br />\nthan a few old ladies and couples<br />\nmade a deliberate and visible effort<br />\nto find the other side of the street<br />\nbefore we crossed their path. One<br />\ncarload of people kept following us<br />\naround the block beeping their<br />\nhorn. They might have been<br />\nperverts, too, but for their smiles<br />\nand laughs. The run-in with the<br />\npolice was inevitable. Their first<br />\nquestion was \"Where is the party?\"<br />\nAfter I .told them the<br />\noccasion\u2014Russ' last night, we<br />\ntalked for awhile and when one of<br />\nthem found out that I was a<br />\npre-med at Johns Hopkins\u2014a<br />\nfuture doctor--he could take no<br />\nmore and urged his partner to<br />\nspeed off before he suffered more.<br />\nWe did visit one restaurant, a<br />\nfavorite for some late night coffee.<br />\nAgain, people were quite shocked<br /><br />\nRichard Waring<br />\nFred Slone<br />\nB.

Following a<br />\ntransitional period \u2022 during the<br />\nsummer, Scott took over the<br />\nreins of the Athletic Center on a<br />\nfull time basis August 29.<br />\n\"I'm really enjoying it,\" said<br />\nScott of his new role, and after a<br />\npair of full and active weeks he<br />\nremains undaunted by his<br />\nincreased responsibilities.<br />\nThe Athletic Department at<br />\nHopkins is hardly unfamiliar<br />\nterritory to Scott, who has been<br />\nan integral part of the coaching<br />\nstaff here for almost twenty<br />\nyears.

In that<br />\ncapacity he has guided six<br />\nHopkins' tens to the National<br />\nChampionships and produced 40<br />\nfirst-team All-Americans. In<br />\naddition, he has received the<br />\nMorris Touchstone Trophy as the<br />\nLacrosse Coach of the Year for<br />\nhis efforts in 1965, 1968, and<br />\n1972.<br />\nWhile not concerned with the<br />\nlacrosse season, the new Athletic<br />\nDirector has also coached Blue<br />\nJay squads in soccer, basketball,<br />\nand wrestling for varying lengths<br />\nof time.<br />\nAs the Athletic Director, Scott<br />\nintends to continue the many<br /><br />\nprograms initiated by former<br />\nDirector Turner and institute<br />\nsome of the ideas his predecessor<br />\nwas unable to see carried out.<br />\nCommenting on the timing of<br />\nhis promotion, Scott considers<br />\nhimself \"fortunate to move into<br />\nthe job at a time when the<br />\nschool's Administration is giving<br />\nsuch solid support to the Athletic<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\nDean of Students Robert J.<br />\nFtizpatrick, who has ultimate<br />\nresponsibility for the Athletic<br />\nCenter and its program, admitted<br />\nthat the support was long<br />\noverdue.<br />\n\"The impetus for a better<br />\nprogram came when [President<br />\nSteven] Muller was appointed,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\n\"The Blue Ribbon Committee<br />\nreport proposed making the<br />\nAthletic Center a more vital focal<br />\npoint of the campus and the new<br />\nadministration has acted with<br />\nthis intent.\"<br />\nScott is taking this mandate to<br />\nheart and intends to increase the<br />\nstudent usage of the major extra<br />\ncurricular facility currently on<br />\ncampus. \"There will be some<br />\nchanges in the operation of the<br /><br />\nAthletic Director Robert Scott<br />\ncenter, with the emphasis on<br />\nmeeting the needs of all who use<br />\nthe facility,\" he said.<br />\n\"We are anxious to hear of any<br />\ncomments in an effort to keep<br />\nclose contact with the users so<br />\nthat we may keep ahead of any<br />\nproblems and make the necessary<br />\nadjustments.\"<br />\nAnother reason for the<br />\noptimism of Scott's outlook is<br />\nthe condition of the athletic staff<br />\nhe inherits.

Reporting in good<br />\ncondition for the first year are<br />\nsophomore Bob Warren and<br />\nfreshmen Randy Safier, Bill<br />\nMartin, and Jim Kennedy,<br />\nalthough Kennedy has been<br />\nhampered by a knee injury in the<br />\nearly practices.

This arrangement will<br />\nreplace the current two division<br />\nset-up in which member<br />\ninstitutions compete in either the<br />\nUniversity or College Divisions,<br />\nwhen it goes into effect in the<br />\nnext academic year.<br />\nNew Divisions<br />\nNow that the proposal has<br />\nbeen approved, each of the some<br />\n600 member institutions of the<br />\nNCAA is in the process of<br />\nselecting the division in which it<br />\nwill participate. Once this initial<br />\nself-determination has been<br />\nmade, the division members<br />\nthemselves will establish criteria<br /><br />\nfor membership and will<br />\ndetermine the rules and<br />\nregulations to be followed by<br />\nschools competing in their<br />\ndivision. The self-determination<br />\nshould be completed in time for<br />\nthe 68th annual convention in<br />\nSan Francisco this January.<br />\nI.

At this level<br />\nthe overall athletic program will<br />\nbe best served in terms of the<br />\nrelative quality of competition<br />\noffered.<br />\nThe reorganization of the<br />\nNCAA follows years of<br />\ndissatisfaction with the<br />\nregulation of competition by the<br />\nAssociation. Three levels of<br />\ncompetitive intensity have been<br />\nin evidence for years, but as late<br />\nas January of this year, official<br />\nproposals for dealing with.the<br />\nproblems the problems refused to<br />\nrecognize this fact.<br />\nCollege Division<br />\nOriginally, the NCAA<br />\nconsidered all schools on a par<br />\nand maintained a single set of<br />\nregulations for competitive and<br />\nlegislative purposes. By the mid<br /><br />\n1950's smaller schools began a<br />\nseparate competitive program in<br />\nwhat came to be known as the<br />\nCollege Division. This grew out<br />\nof a committee of smaller schools<br />\nthat began meeting at the annual<br />\nconventions to discuss problems<br />\nthat affected schools that did not<br />\nhave the large budgets of the<br />\nmajor powers. Soon after the<br />\nCollege Division was formalized,<br />\na full slate of championships was<br />\noffered.<br />\n\"Fish or Fowl\"<br />\nWith two sets of<br />\nchampionships offered, the<br />\nnation's schools had to identify<br />\nin which division they were<br />\ncompeting for each sport. By the<br />\nearly sixties, the NCAA decreed<br />\nthe \"Fish or Fowl\" rule, which<br />\nmade schools enter their whole<br />\nathletic program in one division<br />\nor the other. This ruling caused<br />\nheadaches for schools that were<br />\nstrong in some sports while weak<br />\nin others. Further troubles arose<br />\nas the lure of the various national<br /><br />\ntitles increased the recruiting<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nSeveral attempts to resolve the<br />\ndifficulties have proven fruitless<br />\nthrough the years. The basic<br />\npositions of the three levels of<br />\nschools have been impossible to<br />\nresolve in a two division<br />\narrangement. Major powers<br />\nfavored restrictive rules to<br />\neconomize the expenses of<br />\nrecruiting, while the minor<br />\npowers with money to spend<br />\ndesired a free hand in their<br />\nefforts to join the major powers.<br />\nMeanwhile the small schools<br />\ndeplored the aggressive recruiting<br />\natmosphere spawned by the<br />\nothers, but were not in favor of<br />\nrestrictive rules that would run<br />\ncounter to their more relaxed<br />\n-ecruiting situations.<br />\nWith the advent of the new<br />\nhree division proposal, these<br />\nproblems appeared to be<br />\nsmoothed out and the NCAA<br />\nSpecial Convention approved it<br />\noverwhelmingly.<br /><br />\nTicket plan announced<br />\n4<br /><br />\nThe Athletic Department<br />\nannounced a new policy with<br />\nregard to the admission to<br />\nfootball games this year.<br />\nEffective immediately,<br />\nEmployees of the University will<br />\nalso be given the privilege of<br />\nfree admittance to Homewood<br />\nField athletic events.<br />\nAs in the past, full time Johns<br />\nHopkins students will be admitted<br />\nto home football games on their<br />\nregular University ID cards.
