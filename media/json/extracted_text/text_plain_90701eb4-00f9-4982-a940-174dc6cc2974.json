Griffith, David Kotelchuck.<br />\n<br />\nThe Thief Of Time<br />\nTwo weeks ago the Student Council, after procrastinating<br />\nfor a month, passed up its final chance to send a Hopkins student<br />\nto Russia. The Council tossed the entire problem of financing the<br />\ntrip and selecting a student representative into the lap of The<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nThe News-Letter is only too happy to shoulder the responsibility. We consider it a challenge to our resourcefulness, a challenge which we hope can be met successfully.<br />\nAt the same time, however, we feel that the Student Council<br />\nhas disappointed the people who elected it last year. In answer<br />\nto a questionnaire distributed in the contested campus elections<br />\nof three weeks ago, 487 of 618 students (78 per cent) voted in<br />\nfavor of Hopkins' participation in the tour. Of these, 313 men<br />\nsaid they would contribute to a fund supporting the trip.<br />\nIn the face of these figures, the Council voted against arranging the proposed tour. Council members gave as excuses for<br />\ntheir refusal \"too 'little time\" and \"too' much other work to be<br />\ndone around campus.\"<br />\nThe Neu's-Letter realizes that the school year is close to terniination ; but we point to the fact that the SC spent four weeks<br />\ndoing nothing with the problem. In those four weeks, the Council<br />\nmade no investigations on fund-raising outside of the aforementioned student questionnaire. No on-campus solicitations were<br />\nmade, even after The News-Letter offered $50 to start the drive;<br />\nneither was any investigation attempted into the availability of<br />\nextra-campug funds.<br />\nThe News-Letter also realizes that the Council has other obligations on campus. Prominent among them, according to a<br />\nstatement made last week by SC Vice-president Herbert Belgrad,<br />\nis the completion of the revision of the Council Constitution.<br />\nThis is another projek which has been ensnarled in the red tape<br />\nof Council committees for much longer than is consistent with<br />\nthe demands of efficiency. As a matter of fact, the revision of<br />\nthe Constitution has been making the Council rounds since last<br />\nSeptember.<br />\nIt occurs to us that the Council could have better served the<br />\ninterests of The Hopkins by assuming responsibility for the student tour than by doing such things as spending an entire year<br />\nin overhauling an outmoded Constitution. Besides gaining valuable favorable publicity for the University, sending a student to<br />\nRussia would have enabled the entire student body to benefit<br />\nthrough articles and lectures rendered by a competent representative on his return from the Soviet Union.<br />\nThe facet of this unfortunate situation which disturbs us<br />\nmost is the Council's refusal even to attempt to make the proposed tour a reality. At least concerning this affair, little initiative or drive has been shown by the Council, whose main obligation, again according to Belgrad, \"is to the students whom we<br />\nrepresent ...\"Moreover, the SC's indecision has hurt materially<br />\nany other organization's chances of meeting with success the<br />\nproblem of financing the trip.<br />\nAdmonition to the new Council: act wisely and with circumspection, but with reasonable speed.<br />\n<br />\nCORRESPONDENCE<br />\nTHEY SEE RED<br />\nDear Sirs:<br />\nIn an editorial a few weeks ago<br />\nyou decried the fact that there<br />\nwas no way a student could hear<br />\nfrom a Marxist what Marxism is.<br />\nThis is indeed a lamentable fact<br />\nwhen you consider, as I believe you<br />\ndid in your editorial, that almost<br />\nhalf the people of the world live<br />\nunder governments with Marxist<br />\nleadership as well as the fact that<br />\nin the \"non-Marxist world\" large<br />\nsections of the populations of many<br />\ncountries (France, Italy, India,<br />\netc.) accept a Marxist philosophy.<br />\nA situation has been created by<br />\nwitch-hunters in government, business, and education circles where<br />\nall Marxist (or anyone resembling<br />\nMarxist) professors, and in some<br />\ncases students, have been forced<br />\nfrom the campuses of our country.<br />\nAs a result, American students<br />\nare unable to freely hear and discuss a vast scientific body of<br />\nknowledge which believes that the<br />\nworking class is the most important and most progressive force in<br />\nmodern society, and that under the<br />\nleadership of the working class,<br />\nthe American people can end war,<br />\neconomic crisis, racial inequality,<br />\nand all forms of exploitation forever.<br />\nMore important, because of the<br />\nforced inability of Marxists to present and defend their own ideas,<br />\nthe McCarthyites have been able to<br />\ngo almost unchallenged in their<br />\npromulgation of the big lie that<br />\nMarxism is an international conspiracy dedicated to the violent<br />\noverthrow of existing government.<br />\nIt is this big lie that has led to<br />\nthe disintegration of academic<br />\nfreedom and brought our nation<br />\nperilously close to'atomic war. Because one accepts the idea that<br />\nMarxists are criminal conspirators, then anyone who resembles<br />\na Marxist is suspect (and the fact<br />\nis that anyone who is for peace,<br />\nequality, social welfare, or the<br />\nBill of Rights resembles a Marxist\u2014because that is what Marxists<br />\nfavor.)<br />\nIn order to help make at least a<br />\nsmall dent in this \"iron curtain\"<br />\nwhich exists across our land, the<br />\nLabor Youth League, an independent youth organization with a<br />\nMarxist outlook, has set up a<br />\nSpeaker's Bureau to help answer<br />\nthe need expressed by many students to hear a Marxist presentation.<br />\nRecently meetings have been held<br />\nat the University of Wisconsin,<br />\nwhere LYL National Chairman,<br />\nLeon Wofsy, spoke; and at CCNY,<br />\nwhere students heard Doxey Wilkerson, Director of the Jefferson<br />\nSchool of Social Science.<br />\nThe Speakers Bureau also includes Herbert Aptheker, noted<br />\nauthor and scholar in the field of<br />\nNegro history; Sidney Finklestein,<br />\ncritic and author of many books;<br />\nDr. Harry K.

Griffith, David Kotelchuck.<br /><br />\nThe Thief Of Time<br />\nTwo weeks ago the Student Council, after procrastinating<br />\nfor a month, passed up its final chance to send a Hopkins student<br />\nto Russia. The Council tossed the entire problem of financing the<br />\ntrip and selecting a student representative into the lap of The<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nThe News-Letter is only too happy to shoulder the responsibility. We consider it a challenge to our resourcefulness, a challenge which we hope can be met successfully.<br />\nAt the same time, however, we feel that the Student Council<br />\nhas disappointed the people who elected it last year. In answer<br />\nto a questionnaire distributed in the contested campus elections<br />\nof three weeks ago, 487 of 618 students (78 per cent) voted in<br />\nfavor of Hopkins' participation in the tour. Of these, 313 men<br />\nsaid they would contribute to a fund supporting the trip.<br />\nIn the face of these figures, the Council voted against arranging the proposed tour. Council members gave as excuses for<br />\ntheir refusal \"too 'little time\" and \"too' much other work to be<br />\ndone around campus.\"<br />\nThe Neu's-Letter realizes that the school year is close to terniination ; but we point to the fact that the SC spent four weeks<br />\ndoing nothing with the problem. In those four weeks, the Council<br />\nmade no investigations on fund-raising outside of the aforementioned student questionnaire. No on-campus solicitations were<br />\nmade, even after The News-Letter offered $50 to start the drive;<br />\nneither was any investigation attempted into the availability of<br />\nextra-campug funds.<br />\nThe News-Letter also realizes that the Council has other obligations on campus. Prominent among them, according to a<br />\nstatement made last week by SC Vice-president Herbert Belgrad,<br />\nis the completion of the revision of the Council Constitution.<br />\nThis is another projek which has been ensnarled in the red tape<br />\nof Council committees for much longer than is consistent with<br />\nthe demands of efficiency. As a matter of fact, the revision of<br />\nthe Constitution has been making the Council rounds since last<br />\nSeptember.<br />\nIt occurs to us that the Council could have better served the<br />\ninterests of The Hopkins by assuming responsibility for the student tour than by doing such things as spending an entire year<br />\nin overhauling an outmoded Constitution. Besides gaining valuable favorable publicity for the University, sending a student to<br />\nRussia would have enabled the entire student body to benefit<br />\nthrough articles and lectures rendered by a competent representative on his return from the Soviet Union.<br />\nThe facet of this unfortunate situation which disturbs us<br />\nmost is the Council's refusal even to attempt to make the proposed tour a reality. At least concerning this affair, little initiative or drive has been shown by the Council, whose main obligation, again according to Belgrad, \"is to the students whom we<br />\nrepresent ...\"Moreover, the SC's indecision has hurt materially<br />\nany other organization's chances of meeting with success the<br />\nproblem of financing the trip.<br />\nAdmonition to the new Council: act wisely and with circumspection, but with reasonable speed.<br /><br />\nCORRESPONDENCE<br />\nTHEY SEE RED<br />\nDear Sirs:<br />\nIn an editorial a few weeks ago<br />\nyou decried the fact that there<br />\nwas no way a student could hear<br />\nfrom a Marxist what Marxism is.<br />\nThis is indeed a lamentable fact<br />\nwhen you consider, as I believe you<br />\ndid in your editorial, that almost<br />\nhalf the people of the world live<br />\nunder governments with Marxist<br />\nleadership as well as the fact that<br />\nin the \"non-Marxist world\" large<br />\nsections of the populations of many<br />\ncountries (France, Italy, India,<br />\netc.) accept a Marxist philosophy.<br />\nA situation has been created by<br />\nwitch-hunters in government, business, and education circles where<br />\nall Marxist (or anyone resembling<br />\nMarxist) professors, and in some<br />\ncases students, have been forced<br />\nfrom the campuses of our country.<br />\nAs a result, American students<br />\nare unable to freely hear and discuss a vast scientific body of<br />\nknowledge which believes that the<br />\nworking class is the most important and most progressive force in<br />\nmodern society, and that under the<br />\nleadership of the working class,<br />\nthe American people can end war,<br />\neconomic crisis, racial inequality,<br />\nand all forms of exploitation forever.<br />\nMore important, because of the<br />\nforced inability of Marxists to present and defend their own ideas,<br />\nthe McCarthyites have been able to<br />\ngo almost unchallenged in their<br />\npromulgation of the big lie that<br />\nMarxism is an international conspiracy dedicated to the violent<br />\noverthrow of existing government.<br />\nIt is this big lie that has led to<br />\nthe disintegration of academic<br />\nfreedom and brought our nation<br />\nperilously close to'atomic war. Because one accepts the idea that<br />\nMarxists are criminal conspirators, then anyone who resembles<br />\na Marxist is suspect (and the fact<br />\nis that anyone who is for peace,<br />\nequality, social welfare, or the<br />\nBill of Rights resembles a Marxist\u2014because that is what Marxists<br />\nfavor.)<br />\nIn order to help make at least a<br />\nsmall dent in this \"iron curtain\"<br />\nwhich exists across our land, the<br />\nLabor Youth League, an independent youth organization with a<br />\nMarxist outlook, has set up a<br />\nSpeaker's Bureau to help answer<br />\nthe need expressed by many students to hear a Marxist presentation.<br />\nRecently meetings have been held<br />\nat the University of Wisconsin,<br />\nwhere LYL National Chairman,<br />\nLeon Wofsy, spoke; and at CCNY,<br />\nwhere students heard Doxey Wilkerson, Director of the Jefferson<br />\nSchool of Social Science.<br />\nThe Speakers Bureau also includes Herbert Aptheker, noted<br />\nauthor and scholar in the field of<br />\nNegro history; Sidney Finklestein,<br />\ncritic and author of many books;<br />\nDr. Harry K.
