Cleveland<br />\n<br />\nA Doubtful Issue<br />\nIn theory the Gentlemen's Code Commission is a<br />\nsorely wanted adjunct to student government on this<br />\ncampus. In our editorial of May 12, we pointed out that<br />\nthere are many valid reasons for instituting such a body<br />\nat Homewood. The legislative and judicial functions of<br />\nthe student government should be separated, and this<br />\njudicial function should be integrated into a single body<br />\nwith jurisdiction over the entire campus. Moreover, as<br />\nhas been apparent for several years, there must be distinct and equitable rules of conduct for all judicial<br />\nproceedings.<br />\n_ However, this is not to say that the proposed Gentlemen's Code Commission is an entirely adequate document. While this amendment does contain several<br />\nneeded provisions designed to correct the shortcomings<br />\nof our present system, it also endangers the very basis of<br />\nundergraduate life at Hopkins\u2014the Gentlemen's Code.<br />\nFor this Commission to function, the Student Council must first legislate into existence a whole series of<br />\nregulations and penalties. It is obvious that this necessary<br />\nenactment of a judicial code is a negation of the Gentlemen's Code, which the Commission is, ironically, designed to protect.<br />\nIf the Student Council is especially prudent in passing this legislation, and if the Commission itself rightly<br />\ninterprets the Gentlemen's Code, then the prized and<br />\ndesired freedom of the undergraduate can be maintained.<br />\nIf this is not the case, then the Gentlemen's Code will<br />\nbecome a meaningless piece of paper.<br />\nThe student body should carefully weigh both the<br />\nadvantages and the disadvantages of the Gentlemen's<br />\nCode Commission before voting on the issue next meek.<br />\nNo one has yet been able to give a complete solution to<br />\nthe problem, and it might be hoped that the Commission<br />\nis an improvement on the existing situation. However, in<br />\nthe last analysis the decision is the student's, and he alone<br />\ncan make it.<br />\n<br />\nKesler makes no pretensions<br />\nabout the monotony of the job.<br />\n\"It's something that has to be<br />\ndone; and I have the time,\" he<br />\nrecently stated to a News-Letter<br />\nreporter.<br />\n\"It wasn't even my<br />\nidea.\"<br />\n<br />\nDICK KESLER AND ROLAND DISCUSS THE CALENDAR<br />\n<br />\nJHU Enters Lani Ferris<br />\nInGlamourMagContest<br />\nIn its second annual effort to<br />\ngain prominence in the world of<br />\nfeminine fashion, Hopkins enters<br />\nGlamour Magazine's competition<br />\nfor the ten best-dressed young<br />\nladies on American college cam-<br />\n<br />\nWelcome, Norman Thomas<br />\nDiscoursing editorially upon the occasion of Norman<br />\nThomas' seventy-fifth birthday, The New York Times<br />\nsaid, \"In six Presidential campaigns it has been possible<br />\nfor American voters who didn't like either of the major<br />\ncandidates to cast their ballots for Norman Thomas. It<br />\nwas a safe thing to do this, for they knew that Mr.<br />\nThomas, who calls himself a Socialist, would not go to<br />\nthe White House\u2014except possibly for lunch. It was safe<br />\nin another way for no one quite lost his vote when he<br />\ngave it to a man so intelligent, so patriotic and so universally respected as Norman Matoon Thomas.\"<br />\nA man of seventy-seven years now, Mr. Thomas<br />\nhas long given up running for political office. He remains both an admired and respected citizen as well<br />\nas eloquent testimony to the American right of dissent.<br />\nA Socialist since 1918, Mr. Thomas might today modify<br />\nsome of the causes for which he has stood in the last<br />\nforty-five years. But few men, of whatever political or<br />\neconomic coloring, can argue with the universality of<br />\nhis doctrines. He would never relinquish his belief that<br />\nwar and democracy cannot coexist, the pacifism which<br />\nled him to oppose conscription, or his dislike of any<br />\nkind of violence\u2014including the type practiced by Moscow. Mr. Thomas is no Marxist, in any sense of the word.<br />\nNorman Thomas himself has written, \"It is with<br />\nsomewhat mixed emotions that I find myself classified<br />\nas a leading American dissenter. I am indeed proud and<br />\nhappy to live in a country where the right to dissent is<br />\nembodied in the basic law. I wish it were more honored<br />\nin practice. It is a right essential to any concept of the<br />\ndignity and freedom of the individual; it is essential<br />\nto the search for truth in a world wherein no authority<br />\nis infallible.\"<br />\nMr. Thomas' topic for his speech here at Johns<br />\nHopkins is \"Can We Win Peace?\" Students may expect<br />\nto hear some unconventional thoughts on the relative<br />\nattitudes of Premier Khrushchev and the Pentagon toward disarmament. He believes the two systems, the<br />\nRussian and ours, might in time draw closer together,<br />\nthus eliminating the deadly struggle in which we are<br />\nnow involved. Nevertheless he realizes that the United<br />\nStates would take and hold the lead in the \"enjoyment<br />\nof democracy and individual right.\"<br />\nWe heartily concur with The Times in saying,<br />\n44... it is wonderful to have Mr. Thomas around\u2014we<br />\nhope he will be here for long years to come.\"<br />\n<br />\nBad Press<br />\nThe Student Council this week briefly toyed with<br />\nthe idea of changing their meeting time to a later part of<br />\nthe week. One purpose of this change was to prevent the<br />\nNews-Letter from reporting on the SC meeting. Unluckily the change was impossible to accomplish and the meettings will remain on Monday night. We offer our condolences to the SC on this unsuccessful venture and offer,<br />\nin lieu of a better suggestion, that they learn to function<br />\nefficiently and reasonably.

Though<br />\nattendance was down from last<br />\nyear's very successful concert by<br />\nNina Simone, the music performed indicated both a discerning interest in jazz and a desire<br />\nto see more advanced music presented to Hopkins on the part<br />\nof Dr. Wickwire.<br />\nAlmost all the compositons<br />\nperformed were by leader Mingus, and justly so, for his writing<br />\nis among the most eloquent in<br />\ncontemporary music. The textures and colors of Mingus' arrangements are uniquely personal, yet his music as a whole<br />\nportrays the feelings of all men<br />\nat their base. \"Fables of Faubus,\" perhaps the most famous<br />\nof all Mingus' writing, was performed with all the passion and<br />\nwit which it requires, surpassing,<br />\nto my mind, the recording of it<br />\nreleased by Columbia.<br />\n6 Man Group<br />\nAll the music was played in a<br />\nvery competent manner by the<br />\nsix man group; the technicallydifficult ensembles were executed<br />\nwith precision and spirit. Trumpet man Richard Williams displayed a pretty, if cutting, tone<br />\nand a clean attack; but there<br />\nwas evidence in his solos of a<br />\n<br />\nlack of original ideas, and he<br />\ngenerally contented himself with<br />\nrunning the changes.

Henderson<br />\nConsideration of any proposed<br />\nchange in our system of student<br />\ngovernment should begin with<br />\nthe question: Is there a need<br />\nfor some kind of change? We<br />\nmust then find out whether the<br />\nproposal will meet the needs it<br />\nis designed to satisfy. We will<br />\nthen want to know whether the<br />\nproposal will be necessarily accompanied<br />\nby other effects<br />\nwhich may be desirable or undesirable. If these effects are<br />\nsufficiently undesirable, more<br />\noverall harm than good may be<br />\nthe result of adopting the proposal, even if it meets certain<br />\nneeds.<br />\nThere seem to be three arguments upholding a deficiency in<br />\nthe present non-academic judicial system: (a) Currently several<br />\nstudent<br />\ngovernment<br />\nbodies<br />\ndouble as judicial and legislative<br />\nagencies. This is unjust or at<br />\nleast undesirable; these functions should be separated (b)<br />\nUnder the present system several<br />\nbodies exercise non-academic<br />\njudicial functions. This has permitted an unfair variance in<br />\nthe types of actions punished<br />\nand/or the penalties imposed for<br />\nsimilar offenses. (c) The Student<br />\nCouncil Constitution gives that<br />\nbody an unrestricted power to<br />\ndeal with cases of non-academic<br />\nhonor. There is no written or<br />\ncustomary procedure for Student<br />\nCouncil judicial actions; no listing of the rights of an accused;<br />\nno listing of violations to determine who shall be tried; no listing of penalties to determine<br />\nwhat shall be imposed for a<br />\ngiven violation. This is first of<br />\nall theoretically unjust because<br />\nan individual does not know in<br />\nadvance what actions are apt to<br />\ninvolve him in a trial or what<br />\nsort of punishment is likely for<br />\na certain kind of action. The<br />\nactual decision of the Student<br />\nCouncil is in fact the only statement of violations and penalties<br />\nand is nothing more than an ex<br />\n(Continued on Page 5),<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH 2, 1962<br />\n<br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\neaviedrafridence<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\nPost facto declaration thereof.<br />\nMoreover, there is no procedural<br />\nguarantee that an individual will<br />\nbe treated fairly. These are more<br />\nthan theoretical dangers: the<br />\nflag-stealing case is an example<br />\nof each of these evils.<br />\nIn regard to (a) the most<br />\nObvious point is that the DSRC<br />\nhas already separated legislative<br />\nand judicial functions by setting<br />\n<br />\nup its independent Trial Board.<br />\nThis fact just about destroys the<br />\nfirst attack against the present<br />\nsystem. The IFC has a judicial<br />\nfunction, but it is untouched<br />\nby the Gentlemen's Code Commission and is irrelevant to this<br />\nfirst argument. What is left is<br />\nthe one case per year or two<br />\nyears that the Student Council<br />\nis called upon to handle.

L. SCHWING<br />\n<br />\nsufficient to call for an independent Student Council judiciary because it is unjust or<br />\nlikely to be unjust to have the<br />\nsame body that makes rules hold<br />\ntrials for violations of those<br />\nrules. In reply to this, the obvious<br />\npoint is that the decision in<br />\na case decided by an otherwise<br />\nlegislative body could be perfectly just while the decision<br />\nof an independent judiciary<br />\ncould be completely unjust. The<br />\nquestion then becomes: Generally speaking, is there any reason<br />\nwhy an independent judicial<br />\nbody holding a trial is more<br />\nlikely to reach a just decision<br />\n<br />\nthan a body that has also a<br />\nlegislative function. When we<br />\nconsider the question in the<br />\ncontext of collegiate student<br />\ngovernment and not in terms of<br />\ncut-and-dried political doctrines<br />\nof no prima facie relevance to<br />\nstudent government, the answer<br />\nis no. Does the experience of<br />\nthe Student Council indicate that<br />\nthe combination of judicial and<br />\nlegislative functions has caused<br />\ninjustice? No. Charges of injustice here rest upon the<br />\narguments considered below: the<br />\nlack of procedure, lists of violations and penalties etc., all of<br />\nwhich could be remedied, if in-<br />\n<br />\ndeed defects, within the Council,<br />\nwithout separating these functions.<br />\nIt is obvious that the whole<br />\nargument about separating the<br />\njudicial and legislative functions<br />\narose from and was relevant to<br />\nthe DSRC situation: Pressures<br />\non elected representatives, loss<br />\nof prestige and effectiveness, and<br />\nthe injustice of the same body<br />\nmaking and enforcing rules pertain to the DSRC, but not to<br />\nthe Student Council or any other<br />\nbody.

Fortunately, the<br />\ncagers found a better outlet in which to vent their rage.<br />\nThey decided to pour the ball through the hoops, rather<br />\nthan venture into literary endeavors.<br />\nIn its last two regular season encounters, the Jay five<br />\nhit for two season scoring highs, one in losing to Hampden-Sydney, 92-73, the other in downing Dickinson, 82-78,<br />\nin the campaign's finale.

Over-all, the Jays have compiled a 7-14<br />\nrecord, including five straight losses prior to last week's<br />\nvictory over the Bees.<br />\nNever Say Die<br />\n<br />\nAnother interesting historical fact is that last night's<br />\nopponent Randolph-Macon has never beaten Hopkins in<br />\nits thirteen tries since 1946. More important than the<br />\nresults of last night's game is the praiseworthy fact that<br />\nRoss Sachs's quintet never said \"die\" and was still battling<br />\nto fatten up the win column after a clearly disappointing<br />\nseason. It is an easy thing to give up after losing dismally throughout the course of a season. That the<br />\nhoopsters have not lost heart is evidenced by their recent<br />\nspirited play. One only hopes that next year sincere compliments can be elicited earlier in a winning season.<br />\nUnsung Heroes<br />\n<br />\nNo one notices them when they are there; it's when<br />\nthey absent themslves that their worth becomes manifest.<br />\nManagers play a vital part in the functioning of any<br />\nathletic squad: they serve as a coach's right-hand man,<br />\ntabulate statistics, take charge of equipment, and do<br />\nsundry other vital, but unglorified tasks.<br />\nThe job of manager is not particularly appealing to<br />\nme, though I will admit to once harboring a deep-seated<br />\ndesire to be bat boy for the Orioles. For those, however,<br />\nwho need the exercise (who doesn't?), and are not<br />\nphysically capable of particpating on the team as players,<br />\nmanaging could prove a worthwhile endeavor.

Head of the calendar<br />\nproject is Dick Kesler, an industrious Junior, who is operating<br />\nunder the auspices of the Junior<br />\nClass Driving Committee.<br /><br />\nPublisher<br />\nArthur H. Cleveland<br /><br />\nA Doubtful Issue<br />\nIn theory the Gentlemen's Code Commission is a<br />\nsorely wanted adjunct to student government on this<br />\ncampus. In our editorial of May 12, we pointed out that<br />\nthere are many valid reasons for instituting such a body<br />\nat Homewood. The legislative and judicial functions of<br />\nthe student government should be separated, and this<br />\njudicial function should be integrated into a single body<br />\nwith jurisdiction over the entire campus. Moreover, as<br />\nhas been apparent for several years, there must be distinct and equitable rules of conduct for all judicial<br />\nproceedings.<br />\n_ However, this is not to say that the proposed Gentlemen's Code Commission is an entirely adequate document. While this amendment does contain several<br />\nneeded provisions designed to correct the shortcomings<br />\nof our present system, it also endangers the very basis of<br />\nundergraduate life at Hopkins\u2014the Gentlemen's Code.<br />\nFor this Commission to function, the Student Council must first legislate into existence a whole series of<br />\nregulations and penalties. It is obvious that this necessary<br />\nenactment of a judicial code is a negation of the Gentlemen's Code, which the Commission is, ironically, designed to protect.<br />\nIf the Student Council is especially prudent in passing this legislation, and if the Commission itself rightly<br />\ninterprets the Gentlemen's Code, then the prized and<br />\ndesired freedom of the undergraduate can be maintained.<br />\nIf this is not the case, then the Gentlemen's Code will<br />\nbecome a meaningless piece of paper.<br />\nThe student body should carefully weigh both the<br />\nadvantages and the disadvantages of the Gentlemen's<br />\nCode Commission before voting on the issue next meek.<br />\nNo one has yet been able to give a complete solution to<br />\nthe problem, and it might be hoped that the Commission<br />\nis an improvement on the existing situation. However, in<br />\nthe last analysis the decision is the student's, and he alone<br />\ncan make it.<br /><br />\nKesler makes no pretensions<br />\nabout the monotony of the job.<br />\n\"It's something that has to be<br />\ndone; and I have the time,\" he<br />\nrecently stated to a News-Letter<br />\nreporter.<br />\n\"It wasn't even my<br />\nidea.\"<br /><br />\nDICK KESLER AND ROLAND DISCUSS THE CALENDAR<br /><br />\nJHU Enters Lani Ferris<br />\nInGlamourMagContest<br />\nIn its second annual effort to<br />\ngain prominence in the world of<br />\nfeminine fashion, Hopkins enters<br />\nGlamour Magazine's competition<br />\nfor the ten best-dressed young<br />\nladies on American college cam-<br /><br />\nWelcome, Norman Thomas<br />\nDiscoursing editorially upon the occasion of Norman<br />\nThomas' seventy-fifth birthday, The New York Times<br />\nsaid, \"In six Presidential campaigns it has been possible<br />\nfor American voters who didn't like either of the major<br />\ncandidates to cast their ballots for Norman Thomas. It<br />\nwas a safe thing to do this, for they knew that Mr.<br />\nThomas, who calls himself a Socialist, would not go to<br />\nthe White House\u2014except possibly for lunch. It was safe<br />\nin another way for no one quite lost his vote when he<br />\ngave it to a man so intelligent, so patriotic and so universally respected as Norman Matoon Thomas.\"<br />\nA man of seventy-seven years now, Mr. Thomas<br />\nhas long given up running for political office. He remains both an admired and respected citizen as well<br />\nas eloquent testimony to the American right of dissent.<br />\nA Socialist since 1918, Mr. Thomas might today modify<br />\nsome of the causes for which he has stood in the last<br />\nforty-five years. But few men, of whatever political or<br />\neconomic coloring, can argue with the universality of<br />\nhis doctrines. He would never relinquish his belief that<br />\nwar and democracy cannot coexist, the pacifism which<br />\nled him to oppose conscription, or his dislike of any<br />\nkind of violence\u2014including the type practiced by Moscow. Mr. Thomas is no Marxist, in any sense of the word.<br />\nNorman Thomas himself has written, \"It is with<br />\nsomewhat mixed emotions that I find myself classified<br />\nas a leading American dissenter. I am indeed proud and<br />\nhappy to live in a country where the right to dissent is<br />\nembodied in the basic law. I wish it were more honored<br />\nin practice. It is a right essential to any concept of the<br />\ndignity and freedom of the individual; it is essential<br />\nto the search for truth in a world wherein no authority<br />\nis infallible.\"<br />\nMr. Thomas' topic for his speech here at Johns<br />\nHopkins is \"Can We Win Peace?\" Students may expect<br />\nto hear some unconventional thoughts on the relative<br />\nattitudes of Premier Khrushchev and the Pentagon toward disarmament. He believes the two systems, the<br />\nRussian and ours, might in time draw closer together,<br />\nthus eliminating the deadly struggle in which we are<br />\nnow involved. Nevertheless he realizes that the United<br />\nStates would take and hold the lead in the \"enjoyment<br />\nof democracy and individual right.\"<br />\nWe heartily concur with The Times in saying,<br />\n44... it is wonderful to have Mr. Thomas around\u2014we<br />\nhope he will be here for long years to come.\"<br /><br />\nBad Press<br />\nThe Student Council this week briefly toyed with<br />\nthe idea of changing their meeting time to a later part of<br />\nthe week. One purpose of this change was to prevent the<br />\nNews-Letter from reporting on the SC meeting. Unluckily the change was impossible to accomplish and the meettings will remain on Monday night. We offer our condolences to the SC on this unsuccessful venture and offer,<br />\nin lieu of a better suggestion, that they learn to function<br />\nefficiently and reasonably.

Though<br />\nattendance was down from last<br />\nyear's very successful concert by<br />\nNina Simone, the music performed indicated both a discerning interest in jazz and a desire<br />\nto see more advanced music presented to Hopkins on the part<br />\nof Dr. Wickwire.<br />\nAlmost all the compositons<br />\nperformed were by leader Mingus, and justly so, for his writing<br />\nis among the most eloquent in<br />\ncontemporary music. The textures and colors of Mingus' arrangements are uniquely personal, yet his music as a whole<br />\nportrays the feelings of all men<br />\nat their base. \"Fables of Faubus,\" perhaps the most famous<br />\nof all Mingus' writing, was performed with all the passion and<br />\nwit which it requires, surpassing,<br />\nto my mind, the recording of it<br />\nreleased by Columbia.<br />\n6 Man Group<br />\nAll the music was played in a<br />\nvery competent manner by the<br />\nsix man group; the technicallydifficult ensembles were executed<br />\nwith precision and spirit. Trumpet man Richard Williams displayed a pretty, if cutting, tone<br />\nand a clean attack; but there<br />\nwas evidence in his solos of a<br /><br />\nlack of original ideas, and he<br />\ngenerally contented himself with<br />\nrunning the changes.

Henderson<br />\nConsideration of any proposed<br />\nchange in our system of student<br />\ngovernment should begin with<br />\nthe question: Is there a need<br />\nfor some kind of change? We<br />\nmust then find out whether the<br />\nproposal will meet the needs it<br />\nis designed to satisfy. We will<br />\nthen want to know whether the<br />\nproposal will be necessarily accompanied<br />\nby other effects<br />\nwhich may be desirable or undesirable. If these effects are<br />\nsufficiently undesirable, more<br />\noverall harm than good may be<br />\nthe result of adopting the proposal, even if it meets certain<br />\nneeds.<br />\nThere seem to be three arguments upholding a deficiency in<br />\nthe present non-academic judicial system: (a) Currently several<br />\nstudent<br />\ngovernment<br />\nbodies<br />\ndouble as judicial and legislative<br />\nagencies. This is unjust or at<br />\nleast undesirable; these functions should be separated (b)<br />\nUnder the present system several<br />\nbodies exercise non-academic<br />\njudicial functions. This has permitted an unfair variance in<br />\nthe types of actions punished<br />\nand/or the penalties imposed for<br />\nsimilar offenses. (c) The Student<br />\nCouncil Constitution gives that<br />\nbody an unrestricted power to<br />\ndeal with cases of non-academic<br />\nhonor. There is no written or<br />\ncustomary procedure for Student<br />\nCouncil judicial actions; no listing of the rights of an accused;<br />\nno listing of violations to determine who shall be tried; no listing of penalties to determine<br />\nwhat shall be imposed for a<br />\ngiven violation. This is first of<br />\nall theoretically unjust because<br />\nan individual does not know in<br />\nadvance what actions are apt to<br />\ninvolve him in a trial or what<br />\nsort of punishment is likely for<br />\na certain kind of action. The<br />\nactual decision of the Student<br />\nCouncil is in fact the only statement of violations and penalties<br />\nand is nothing more than an ex<br />\n(Continued on Page 5),<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH 2, 1962<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\neaviedrafridence<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\nPost facto declaration thereof.<br />\nMoreover, there is no procedural<br />\nguarantee that an individual will<br />\nbe treated fairly. These are more<br />\nthan theoretical dangers: the<br />\nflag-stealing case is an example<br />\nof each of these evils.<br />\nIn regard to (a) the most<br />\nObvious point is that the DSRC<br />\nhas already separated legislative<br />\nand judicial functions by setting<br /><br />\nup its independent Trial Board.<br />\nThis fact just about destroys the<br />\nfirst attack against the present<br />\nsystem. The IFC has a judicial<br />\nfunction, but it is untouched<br />\nby the Gentlemen's Code Commission and is irrelevant to this<br />\nfirst argument. What is left is<br />\nthe one case per year or two<br />\nyears that the Student Council<br />\nis called upon to handle. One<br />\ncould still argue that this is<br /><br />\nCHWIN<br />\nSVIOTOR CO.,INC.G<br /><br />\nEST. 1933<br /><br />\nNEW CARS<br /><br />\nUSED CARS<br /><br />\nComplete Auto Mechanical Service<br />\nBody Repairs &amp; Painting<br />\n3326 KESWICK RD., BALTIMORE 11, MD.<br />\nV. L. SCHWING<br /><br />\nsufficient to call for an independent Student Council judiciary because it is unjust or<br />\nlikely to be unjust to have the<br />\nsame body that makes rules hold<br />\ntrials for violations of those<br />\nrules. In reply to this, the obvious<br />\npoint is that the decision in<br />\na case decided by an otherwise<br />\nlegislative body could be perfectly just while the decision<br />\nof an independent judiciary<br />\ncould be completely unjust. The<br />\nquestion then becomes: Generally speaking, is there any reason<br />\nwhy an independent judicial<br />\nbody holding a trial is more<br />\nlikely to reach a just decision<br /><br />\nthan a body that has also a<br />\nlegislative function. When we<br />\nconsider the question in the<br />\ncontext of collegiate student<br />\ngovernment and not in terms of<br />\ncut-and-dried political doctrines<br />\nof no prima facie relevance to<br />\nstudent government, the answer<br />\nis no. Does the experience of<br />\nthe Student Council indicate that<br />\nthe combination of judicial and<br />\nlegislative functions has caused<br />\ninjustice? No. Charges of injustice here rest upon the<br />\narguments considered below: the<br />\nlack of procedure, lists of violations and penalties etc., all of<br />\nwhich could be remedied, if in-<br /><br />\ndeed defects, within the Council,<br />\nwithout separating these functions.<br />\nIt is obvious that the whole<br />\nargument about separating the<br />\njudicial and legislative functions<br />\narose from and was relevant to<br />\nthe DSRC situation: Pressures<br />\non elected representatives, loss<br />\nof prestige and effectiveness, and<br />\nthe injustice of the same body<br />\nmaking and enforcing rules pertain to the DSRC, but not to<br />\nthe Student Council or any other<br />\nbody.

Regardless of how the Jays do in<br />\nthe M-D tourney, they can still<br />\nlook to next year with some<br />\nanticipation. Only Dave Leonhard and Rick Saull graduate<br />\nwhose shoes will be at least partially filled by outstanding freshmen such as Jimmy McNaughton.<br /><br />\n\u2014Jay's Nest<br /><br />\n'Better Late . . .<br />\nBy IRV NATHAN, Sports Editor<br />\nAfter this reporter had decided to call a spade a spade<br />\nand to refrain from the overabundance of euphemisms<br />\nthat usually abound during a losing season, a mighty voice<br />\nof righteous indignation arose from the \"hopeless hoopsters,\" There were rumors that letters would pour in to<br />\nprotect their names, talents, and coach. Fortunately, the<br />\ncagers found a better outlet in which to vent their rage.<br />\nThey decided to pour the ball through the hoops, rather<br />\nthan venture into literary endeavors.<br />\nIn its last two regular season encounters, the Jay five<br />\nhit for two season scoring highs, one in losing to Hampden-Sydney, 92-73, the other in downing Dickinson, 82-78,<br />\nin the campaign's finale. The momentum fortunately carried over into the Mason-Dixon Conference tournament as<br />\nthe hardwooders won their first tourney game since 1954<br />\nin downing sluggish Baltimore University.<br />\nM-D Championships<br /><br />\nIn its thirteen Mason-Dixon tournaments, the Blue<br />\nJays have made it past the first round five times and lost<br />\nin the championship finals twice to American University\u2014<br />\nin 1945 and 1951. Over-all, the Jays have compiled a 7-14<br />\nrecord, including five straight losses prior to last week's<br />\nvictory over the Bees.<br />\nNever Say Die<br /><br />\nAnother interesting historical fact is that last night's<br />\nopponent Randolph-Macon has never beaten Hopkins in<br />\nits thirteen tries since 1946. More important than the<br />\nresults of last night's game is the praiseworthy fact that<br />\nRoss Sachs's quintet never said \"die\" and was still battling<br />\nto fatten up the win column after a clearly disappointing<br />\nseason. It is an easy thing to give up after losing dismally throughout the course of a season. That the<br />\nhoopsters have not lost heart is evidenced by their recent<br />\nspirited play. One only hopes that next year sincere compliments can be elicited earlier in a winning season.<br />\nUnsung Heroes<br /><br />\nNo one notices them when they are there; it's when<br />\nthey absent themslves that their worth becomes manifest.<br />\nManagers play a vital part in the functioning of any<br />\nathletic squad: they serve as a coach's right-hand man,<br />\ntabulate statistics, take charge of equipment, and do<br />\nsundry other vital, but unglorified tasks.<br />\nThe job of manager is not particularly appealing to<br />\nme, though I will admit to once harboring a deep-seated<br />\ndesire to be bat boy for the Orioles. For those, however,<br />\nwho need the exercise (who doesn't?), and are not<br />\nphysically capable of particpating on the team as players,<br />\nmanaging could prove a worthwhile endeavor. If you<br />\nhave an altruistic nature and a longing for the smell of<br />\nthe locker room, you might wander over to the gym and<br />\noffer your services. They will be readily appreciated.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 39995, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "6d4de5a8-73ae-41db-9e0d-1244a92dd95c", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13812-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13812, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "5bdf70be-f64c-4c0c-9ffb-b98b79cc6ca3", "url": "/node/13812"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "b51b7103-e84d-457b-886d-5c045fd1c093"}]}
