We felt<br />\nwe had a commitment to people who were here not to raise<br />\ntuition too rapidly.\"<br />\nThe proposal to increase the<br />\nnumber of graduates supported by teaching service, if<br />\nenacted, will increase the<br />\nnumber of graduate students<br />\nwho teach courses at Hopkins.<br />\nArmstrong stressed, however,<br />\nthat the graduates will not<br />\nreplace professors as teachers.<br />\n\"There are some areas<br />\nwhere you will be likely to see<br />\ngraduate students teaching<br />\ncourses, but they will be<br />\ncourses not being taught at<br />\npresent,\" he said. \"We will<br />\ntry to broaden the number of<br />\ncourses, some of which are<br />\nappropriately taught by advanced graduate students. I do<br />\nnot anticipate you will see<br />\ngraduates replacing faculty in<br />\nexisting courses.\"<br />\nArmstrong declined to<br />\nelaborate, however, on how<br />\nthe ten percent decline over<br />\nfive years in Arts and<br />\nSciences' faculty will impact<br />\nupon the number of professors<br />\navailable to teach courses.<br />\n<br />\nContinuing Studies \"produce<br />\nsmall positive balances,\" and<br />\nMedicine \"have substantial<br />\npositive balances to support their<br />\ngrowth, maintain stability, and<br />\nfund commitments to facilities<br />\nand programs,\" the plan is<br />\ndesigned primarily to help Arts<br />\nand Sciences and The Peabody<br />\nConservatory, \"two Hopkins<br />\nunits [that] show chronic underfunded balances.\"<br />\nThe plan also attempts to<br />\nreduce the University's commitment to a series of \"special projects\" it has undertaken over the<br />\npast few years to \"little or<br />\nnothing\" in five years.<br />\nThese include WJHU-FM, the<br />\nChesapeake Bay Institute, the Institute For Policy Studies, the<br />\nHopkins-Nanjing Center, the<br />\nMind/Brain Institute, Hopkins's<br />\nshare of an eight meter groundbased telescope consortium, and<br />\nEvergreen and Homewood<br />\nHouses.<br />\nThe administration has said it<br />\nwants to \"maintain a viable,<br />\nresearch-intensive, tightly focused, and internationally competitive division of Arts and<br />\nSciences and achieve a steady<br />\nstate budget by 1993.\"<br />\nArmstrong said, \"Speaking<br />\njust in terms of faculty positions<br />\nis an unnecessarily stark way to<br />\nview the process,\" he continued.<br />\nIf no savings are to be found, then<br />\nthe plan is to cut the faculty by<br />\nfive per year for five years. On<br />\naverage, up to fifteen die, retire<br />\nor leave each year. So there is<br />\nconsiderable flexibility in the<br />\nDean's office to move positions<br />\naround and to strengthen positions that need to be strengthened.<br />\n\"One of the major concerns is<br />\nthat there are sufficient faculty to<br />\nteach the student loads that appear, to give the quality education<br />\nthat students deserve,\" he went<br />\non. No institution can remain<br />\ngreat by just standing still or<br />\nallowing growth or changes in<br />\nsize to occur at random.\"<br />\nAs to whether these cuts would<br />\nhurt the University's ability to retain and attract star faculty, Armstrong responded, \"There are<br />\nareas that we will pick as being<br />\nof prime importance that we will<br />\nmaintain or increase in excellence. To find the resources<br />\nfor these, other areas will be cut<br />\nback.

Armstrong added that the<br />\nschool will still have a low student to faculty ratio of 10 to 1,<br />\nup from 8 to 1. The job of his office would be to alleviate the<br />\n\"bumps and clumps\" that appear<br />\nin it.<br />\nThe plan also calls for the<br />\npostponement of the construction<br />\nof a new chemistry building to<br />\nreplace Remsen Hall, although it<br />\npromises to fund \"essential<br />\nrenovations for safety and funded research.\" Posner said the<br />\ndepartment has documented promises from the administration,<br />\ndating back to the 1930s and<br />\n1940s to fix electricity and water<br />\n<br />\nproblems that have yet to be<br />\nrectified.<br />\nAccording to the chairman,<br />\nRemsen has serious safety problems in the form of water spills,<br />\nproblems with the water heating,<br />\nand pressure causing stopped or<br />\nburst- tubing resulting in instrumentation damage and experimentation fallacies. It also has<br />\nserious efficiency problems<br />\nwhere research groups are<br />\n\"bursting at the seams\" and programming is. hampered.<br />\nAccording to Posner, the- administration assured him that<br />\nmoney was set aside for construction of a new building despite the<br />\nschool's budgetary problems.<br />\nAsked whether he expects construction to be completed on time,<br />\nhe responded that that \"remains<br />\nto be seen.\"<br />\nThe plan also calls for the<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library<br />\nbudget to increase only eight percent per year, a growth rate that<br />\nought not significantly affect<br />\nundergraduates, according to<br />\nLordan.<br />\nA controversial aspect of the<br />\nplan is the University's commitment to its smaller divisions.

Rather, they believe Hopkins's<br />\nfinancial ills stem not from overexpansion<br />\nor poor decisions, but from revenue shortages resulting from bad timing and unexpectedly small donations to certain University divisions.<br />\nNot enough revenue<br />\n<br />\ncare, liability insurance, and conforming<br />\nto stricter Federal health and safety standards. Another major cost, according to<br />\nEugene Sunshine, senior vice president for<br />\n'administration and treasurer, was Hopkins's<br />\ndesire to maintain its competitiveness with<br />\nother research universities.<br />\n\"If you want to be competitive for the<br />\nkinds of faculty and students we want to<br />\nmaintain and recruit,\" he explained,<br />\n\"there's a significant cost element<br />\nassociated with that, and that manifests<br />\nitself in terms of capital facilities, salaries,<br />\nand student aid. The University financial<br />\ncondition might be a lot different if we<br />\ndidn't have such high standards.\"<br />\nLike other universities, Hopkins cannot<br />\ndip into its permanent endowment to fund<br />\nprojects. Hopkins may spend only the endowment's earnings and its \"quasiendowment,\" funds given to the University for program support that are treated<br />\nas endowment for the purposes of investment but are available for spending.<br />\n<br />\nProvost John Lombardi explained, \"Insofar as the University's financial adjustment can be tracked, it tracks to a combination of two or three important<br />\nphenomena. The first is the need to<br />\nrenovate our physical plant in all parts of<br />\nthe University.<br />\n\"When we look to find the money to<br />\nsupport the building, we look for three or<br />\nfour different sources: research funding,<br />\ndonations from major capital campaigns,<br />\nand some amount of support from the state<br />\ngovernment,\" he continued. \"What happened to Hopkins has been a lag in the timing of the commitment to build the<br />\nbuildings and the production of those<br />\nrevenue sources.\"<br />\nRecalling the telescope, Lombardi said<br />\nHopkins would have attracted many<br />\nresearch grants in the astronomy field had<br />\nthe telescope been launched. Until the<br />\ntelescope's launch, now scheduled for<br />\nsome time in 1990, much of the new<br />\nphysics building, which had been designed to accomodate that research, will be<br />\nunused.<br />\nA second unanticipated revenue shortage<br />\ncomes from the University's current<br />\ncapital campaign. Though Hopkins has<br />\neasily surpassed its original $450 million<br />\ngoal and is steaming toward a new $600<br />\nmillion target, the dollars have not been<br />\ndonated as the University had wished.<br />\n\"The distribution of the $450 million<br />\ndoes not match exactly our plans,\" said<br />\nLombardi. \"In the end, it's the donors who<br />\ndecide what the money goes to. If the<br />\ndonor says, 'I want to buy cancer,' that's<br />\nwhat you have to buy. The total is all right,<br />\nbut it isn't distributed as we would have<br />\nideally determined had it been up to us. We<br />\nthink we'll get the money we need for Arts<br />\nand Sciences, doubling the school's endowment, but it will take considerably<br />\nlonger than we anticipated.\"<br />\nArts and Sciences's endowment, about<br />\n$100 million, represents about one-fifth of<br />\nHopkins's endowment, proportionately less<br />\nthan at comparable research universities.<br />\nHopkins, like other universities, also<br />\nfaced substantially increased costs in health<br />\n<br />\nA&S feels the pinch<br />\nArmstrong and Lombardi first noticed<br />\nArts and Sciences's problems shortly after<br />\nArmstrong assumed his deanship in the<br />\nsummer of 1987.<br />\nLombardi recalled, \"We came to the<br />\nconclusion that it was not possible to deal<br />\nwith this [problem] simply by saying to<br />\nArts and Sciences, 'Well guys, it's your<br />\nbuildings, your money, you suffer,'<br />\nbecause to say that would have destroyed<br />\nArts and Sciences as a viable school.<br />\n\"In the Hopkins tradition there was<br />\nsome argument that that's what we should<br />\nhave done; in the Hopkins tradition every<br />\ntub has its own bottom and you say,<br />\n'Arts and Sciences, tough luck,<br />\nthe Shuttle blew up, you guys close,\"<br />\nhe continued. \"This is not sensible because everybody at Hopkins<br />\nrecognizes that there is no university<br />\nwithout Arts and Sciences in good shape.\"<br />\nConsequently, maintained Sunshine,<br />\nmost major research universities subsidize<br />\ntheir arts and sciences schools, which<br />\nwould otherwise not survive on their own.<br />\nDipping into its University discretionary<br />\nfund, Hopkins usually achieves this end.<br />\nHopkins, though, has long prided<br />\nitself on its divisions maintaining selfsufficiency, and Arts and Sciences clearly<br />\n<br />\nThe University Reserve Fund<br />\n<br />\nMedicine<br />\nEngineering<br />\nContinuing Studies<br />\nHygiene/Public Health<br />\nSA1S<br />\nNursing<br />\nTotal<br />\n<br />\nDivisional 'Total 5 Year<br />\nAdjustment Contribution<br />\n-14.0%<br />\n26.1%<br />\n76.7%<br />\n-70.4%<br />\n-59.7%<br />\n-87.50/0<br />\n-17.7%<br />\n<br />\n23.49<br />\n3.07<br />\n0.86<br />\n4.32<br />\n0.72<br />\n0.32<br />\n32.78<br />\n<br />\n20.00<br />\n3.87<br />\n1.52<br />\n1.27<br />\n0.29<br />\n0.04<br />\n26.99<br />\n<br />\nThe index formula represents the sum of one percent of tuition, fifty<br />\npercent of the earnings on the University's working capital, and five<br />\npercent of indirect cost recoveries.<br />\n<br />\ncould not. \"The exercise of the Five Year.<br />\nPlan to a large extent was to determine<br />\nwhether it was possible to have a<br />\nUniversity-wide solution to the financial<br />\nchallenge that did not destroy the selfsufficiency and the academic independence<br />\nof the divisions. We believe it does achieve<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nAt Hopkins, said Armstrong, Arts and<br />\nSciences gets its revenue primarily from<br />\nundergraduate, federal reimbursement of<br />\nindirect costs of research, interest on its<br />\nendowment, and a small amount of state<br />\naid. The problem, he said, has been that<br />\nrevenues have increased lately at approximately the inflation rate, while expenses<br />\nhave increased much faster.<br />\nArmstrong said, however, that the<br />\nschool has not grown too fast, explaining,<br />\n\"Our competitors have been growing at a<br />\nreasonably rapid rate, while Arts and<br />\nSciences has not. [Still,] we don't have to<br />\ncompete on a numerical basis. In terms of<br />\nour resource base, we grew too fast. To<br />\nthe extent that competition is based on size,<br />\nwe should have grown more rapidly. To<br />\nthe extent it is based on quality of faculty<br />\nand good ideas, maybe we were growing<br />\nat the right size.\"<br />\nPeabody lacks donations<br />\nAs at Arts and Sciences, the Peabody<br />\nConservatory, which Lombardi said has<br />\nreceived a \"tremendous amount of<br />\n<br />\nMichael Blumhard<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter file<br />\n<br />\nArts and Sciences Dean Lloyd Armstrong<br />\nsaid his school's revenues have not kept up<br />\nwith expenditures.<br />\n<br />\nIndex<br />\nFormula<br />\n<br />\nDivision<br />\n<br />\nProvost John Lombardi said Hopkins is<br />\nproud of its reputation as a risk-taking<br />\nuniversity.<br />\n<br />\nmoney\" from Hopkins to sustain its<br />\nreputation, has not received enough donations to maintain its current level of activity. Lombardi said Hopkins does not have<br />\nthe resources to continue subsidizing<br />\nPeabody's operations as it would like.<br />\n\"Hopkins cannot put Peabody's needs<br />\nat the top of the priority list for the institution,\" he said.<br />\nLombardi also explained that reductions<br />\nin University aid to enterprises such as the<br />\nChesapeake Bay Institute, the Institute for<br />\nPolicy Studies, the Nanjing Center, and<br />\nWJHU-FM had always been in the works.<br />\n\"The assumption always has been that<br />\nthese enterprises would receive finite support on a declining basis that would allow<br />\nthem to get started, get firm footing and<br />\na solid base, and then continue as selfsupporting enterprises,\" he said. \"What<br />\nhas never been shown before is an exact<br />\ntime-frame for that to occur.\"<br />\nHopkins as risk-taker<br />\nPerhaps the most telling characteristic of<br />\nHopkins, one that may be largely responsible for past success as well as current difficulties, is Hopkins's propensity to take<br />\nrisks.<br />\n\"Private entrepreneurial universities, if<br />\nthey are to be successful, must take risks,\"<br />\nsaid Lombardi. \"Hopkins is a risk-taking<br />\nuniversity. We're proud of it, and we're<br />\ncelebrated by students, by faculty, and by<br />\ngovernment because Hopkins is risktaking. When we celebrate it, though, we<br />\noften forget that risks means you try a lot<br />\nof things, and some of them may not be<br />\nself-sustainable.<br />\n\"It is not a symbol of mismanagement<br />\nthat risks don't all turn out 100 percent,\"<br />\nhe went on. \"If you take five risks, and<br />\nthree turn out to be successes, you're a<br />\nspectacular success.\"<br />\nLombardi said once Hopkins identifies<br />\nan operation that may be high quality but<br />\ndrains the University's resources, \"we<br />\npare back and readjust and say, 'All right,<br />\nwhat are some new risks we need to take,'<br />\nbecause that's part of being on the cutting<br />\nedge of research, teaching, and intellectual<br />\nenterprise.\"<br />\n<br />\nMoney-starved Peabody to lose much of support<br />\nPLAN, from 4<br />\nHouse and, if it does not sell it,<br />\nwill give WJHU $1.88 million.<br />\nProvost John Lombardi<br />\njustified the expense of these institutes, almost $2 million in 1987<br />\nand 1988 alone, characterizing<br />\nthem as risks that put the University \"at the cutting edge of some<br />\nresearch or service.\"<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Armstrong,<br />\n\"there is a consensus that the<br />\nUniversity is overextended.<br />\nThere is a real recognition of the<br />\ncost of what we have gotten into<br />\n' and I think the Five-Year plans<br />\nassesses this. If it turns out that<br />\nthis is not sufficient, something<br />\nelse must be done.\"<br />\nThe plan also calls for a scaling down of the University's sup-<br />\n<br />\nport for the Peabody institute<br />\nfrom almost $3 million annually<br />\nto $1 million.<br />\nAccording to Robert Pierce,<br />\ndirector of Peabody, \"the reception at the state has been positive<br />\nin the sense that there is<br />\nan understanding that Peabody<br />\nshould not be allowed to have its<br />\ndoors closed. What has not been<br />\nagreed upon is the method by<br />\n<br />\nwhich that is going to be<br />\nachieved.\"<br />\nPeabody suffers a much more<br />\nimmediate crisis than Arts and<br />\nSciences. Internally, it has been<br />\ndecided that Peabody will pursue<br />\nits own fund-raising only after<br />\nArts and Sciences, so as not to<br />\nconflict with its effort. The director also said he faces a much<br />\ngraver risk of faculty attrition and<br />\n<br />\nan inability to continue scholarship support enabling students to<br />\nbe able to afford to attend.<br />\nAccording to Pierce, \"I have<br />\nfaculty members calling me every<br />\nday with concern.

Triggered by the<br />\nnow infamous deficit in the School of Arts,<br />\nand Sciences, the plan was developed by<br />\na team of high-ranking administators in collaboration with principal members of the<br />\nHopkins community. The plan, claiming to<br />\nrepresent the \"collective understanding\"<br />\nof the participants, sets specific limits and<br />\ngoals for University resources and will<br />\nserve, barring rejection by the Board of.<br />\nTrustees, as the \"general blueprint\" for<br />\nresource allocation.<br />\nThe plan's proposal for financial reform<br />\ndepends on identification of and commitment to crucial divisions and programs<br />\nwithin those divisions: non-crucial programs and divisions wkll be phased out. The<br />\ntemporary creation of a reserve fund, to<br />\nwhich divisions will contribute, will serve \u2022<br />\nas a stop-gap measure to correct the immediate deficit. In this way, Johns Hopkins'<br />\nhallowed decentralized tradition will be<br />\npreserved.<br />\nArts and Sciences, as one of \"the original<br />\nstars in the Hopkins galaxy,\" will remain,<br />\nthe plan promises, a \"viable, research intensive, tightly focused and internationally competitive\" division. Yet, in order to<br />\nremain in the decentralized Hopkins galaxy,<br />\nArts and Sciences must toe the galactic<br />\nbudgetary line, and bring its deficit finances<br />\nunder control in the next five years by<br />\nreducing faculty size, increasing undergraduate enrollment, and postponing construction and renovation.<br />\nIt is the inherent contradiction between<br />\nobjective and adjustment that troubles us:<br />\nArts and Sciences cannot cut back its most<br />\nvital components and still hope to maintain<br />\nits high standards.<br />\nThe policy of faculty reduction through<br />\nattrition is one we find especially frightening. It has strained departments and has<br />\ncaused subsequent decline in diversity of<br />\ncourse offerings, even in this past semester.<br />\nFaculty members, disturbed by perceived<br />\n<br />\nnj<br />\n<br />\nMU,SILL, filow AfE<br />\n-THE cAteeR-omEmD<br />\n.f,vrEeviEws- Golly&<br />\nDuo? Ar yogAS<br />\nHopehvS?<br />\n<br />\ndeclines in department prestige, can only<br />\nspeculate as to long term effects, and may<br />\nopt to leave. Certainly, as has been argued<br />\nin the past, this could diminish the number<br />\nand quality of students, both graduate and<br />\nundergraduate, that might choose Hopkins.<br />\nTo meet the gap left by a decrease in<br />\nfaculty, the plan calls for an increase in the<br />\nteaching loads of graduate students. It also<br />\nsuggests the use of non-permanent faculty<br />\nto meet the undergraduate need. Both solutions are undesirable. Visiting faculty, transient in nature, do not provide the constancy<br />\non which great departments are built. Furthermore, one questions the wisdom of using more graduate teaching assistants,<br />\nespecially given the recent fracas over their<br />\nlack of conversational English skills.<br />\nIn addition, the plan calls for increased<br />\nundergraduate enrollment as a source of<br />\nrevenue during the next few years. Combining an even greater student body with<br />\na decimated faculty only compounds the<br />\nproblems facing Arts and Sciences. Low<br />\nfaculty/student ratios, long touted as among<br />\nthe most positive aspects of a Hopkins<br />\neducation, will most certainly suffer.<br />\nIncreased student enrollment will exacerbate long-ignored Homewood woes such as<br />\ninadequate housing and student services.<br />\nFar be it from us to cry \"climate\" during<br />\nthis time of financial adversity, but with<br />\nmore crowded facilities and fewer faculty,<br />\nwe must be pessimistic about the University hoping to attain that ever-elusive sense<br />\nof \"goodwill\" .on campus.<br />\nIn short, the most attractive elements of<br />\na Hopkins undergraduate education\u2014<br />\nexcellent faculty, low faculty/student ratios,<br />\nand quality and diversity of class offerings<br />\nare in jeopardy. We fear a Pyrrhic victory.<br />\nAt ,the very least, we will be perilously<br />\nclose to sacrificing the very things we are<br />\nproudest of. We think that it will require<br />\ncreative management, if not a great deal<br />\nmore, to ensure that academic visions do<br />\nnot become obscured in the process of<br />\n\"reform\".<br />\n<br />\nJog-<br />\n<br />\nGREAT;<br />\n5IW IHF DIRE-Cr-0R OF<br />\nAGENCY<br />\nPLe4SeD! 511r..<br />\n<br />\nWett,<br />\noNE GvY<br />\nBILL GAATilY MD ro<br />\nPaR(46W...<br />\n566440<br />\n49(tr Mgr?<br />\n<br />\n-rewitzy wrerEsIED<br />\nIN BEING wrrN 7-NE.<br />\nBur..<br />\n<br />\npseudoperspicacity<br />\njonathan engler<br />\nIn light of the unique style of<br />\nsecurity which Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity has chosen to exercise<br />\non campus, I thought a revision<br />\nof Security suggestions for the<br />\nstudent body was in order.

The GRO<br />\nwants to make it perfectly clear<br />\nthat it has no problem with what<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office is doing.<br />\nJoanne Houlahan<br />\nThe writer is GRO Chair<br />\n<br />\nFrancis disclaimer<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhile any attack on a person's<br />\ncharacter is hurtful, a charge of<br />\nracism or anti-Semitism is extremely serious. Sidney Maskit<br />\nimplied such a charge against<br />\nGreg Francis in his December 9<br />\nletter in the News-Letter.<br />\nIf Mr. Francis is such an antiSemite (or even insensitive), why<br />\ndid he pledge support to the<br />\n\"Freedom Sunday\" march on<br />\nWashington, D.C. in December,<br />\n1987 which had the sole purpose<br />\nof encouraging human rights and<br />\nfreedom for Soviet Jews? Furthermore, why would a racist<br />\n<br />\nleader of an anti-Semitic group<br />\npledge his support for a chaplain<br />\nwho supports religious activities,<br />\nincluding funding for Jews and<br />\nany other religion, at a small<br />\nmeeting of only supporters in the<br />\nCR's, which obviously is a<br />\nsincere statement as it draws no<br />\npublicity?<br />\nIt is not my intention to be Mr.<br />\nFrancis' apologist. In fact, I was<br />\nvery disturbed by the way Mr.<br />\nMaskit used an insulting political<br />\nploy of his own. By invoking a<br />\nfear of anti-Semitism, a very sensitive issue, he tried to draw emotion against Greg Francis. Mr.<br />\nMaskit appears to think Jews are<br />\na poor, oppressed group which<br />\nneeds vigilant support against<br />\ndiscrimination. Thanks, but Greg<br />\nFrancis poses no immediate threat<br />\nand we can take care of ourselves<br />\nanyway.<br />\nInstead of invariably jumping<br />\non any apparent cause, people<br />\nsuch as Sidney Maskit may do<br />\nbetter by first checking facts. Any<br />\nrational thinker would know that<br />\nMr. Maskit was correct in classifying G. Gordon Liddy as \"an<br />\namusing lunatic\" (perhaps<br />\nMaskit's only correct statement)<br />\nand that the point is that neither<br />\nhe nor Hoffman belong in the<br />\nChaplain's budget.

It<br />\nis a myth that the ability to run<br />\nquickly, respond alertly, or project a strong presence in a tense<br />\nsituation is key to adequate campus protection.

Eddie's is right<br />\nacross the street, as well as a<br />\nlaundromat (though there is one<br />\nin the building, I have yet to find<br />\nit), a bookstore, and four places<br />\n<br />\nto eat: Charles Village Pub,<br />\nC.C.'s Carryout, Homewood<br />\nDelli, and Orient Express. Additionally, WaWa and PizzApeel<br />\nare only a block away.<br />\nIt's also convenient to campus<br />\n\u2014 but mostly if your classes are<br />\non the lower quad. If. on the<br />\nother hand, most of your classes<br />\nare in Mudd and Macaulay, those<br />\ncold mornings can make for a few<br />\nunpleasant treks.<br />\nAbout the actual physical surroundings: They're extremely attractive. That lovely exterior contains just as pretty an interior.<br />\nThe outside, for those who<br />\nhaven't seen it completely, is<br />\nmade of gray stone and the<br />\nbuilding itself is shaped like a<br />\nsquared-off U with the open end<br />\n(which has two gates) facing St..<br />\n<br />\nPaul. Inside the 'U' is a courtyard<br />\nwith benches and a gazebo, and<br />\nthere are flowers, trees, and<br />\nplants blooming practically yearround.<br />\nThe apartments are attractive,<br />\ntoo. The floors are polished<br />\n<br />\nFirst of all, St. Paul<br />\nCourt is in what can<br />\nonly be consiaerea as<br />\na prime location.<br />\nwood. except in kitchens and<br />\nbathrooms, where they're tiled.<br />\nThe apartments have been well<br />\nkept, and maintenance is usually<br />\nquick to respond if there is a problem. The appliances that they<br />\nprovide, as well as the plumbing.<br />\n<br />\nare generally. in good condition.<br />\nthough occasionally the bathtubs<br />\nare a bit slow to drain. However,<br />\nmaintenance can usually solve<br />\nthat problem.<br />\nOther things you should know<br />\nabout St. Paul Court: it's not furnished. so you have to bring your<br />\nown furniture; it is not centrally<br />\nair-conditioned, though there is<br />\ncentral heating: rental rates are<br />\ncompetitive with others around<br />\nthe area; and though there are<br />\nmore students living there now<br />\nthan in past years, the residents<br />\nof St. Paul Court are a nice mix<br />\nof students and \"regular people.\"<br />\nThe rental office is on your left<br />\nas you enter the courtyard.

It must be noted,<br />\nhowever, that the Charles prices<br />\ncompare favorably with housing<br />\nof the same proximity to campus.<br />\nincluding University housing.<br />\nThe Charles is one of the older<br />\nbuildings around, and lacks many<br />\nof the creature comforts that the<br />\nhigh prices warrant. There is no<br />\ntrash chute, so residents must take<br />\ntheir garbage down to the basement. This is not such an inconvenience, when (it) the infamous demon-possessed elevator<br />\nis in operation. De elevator<br />\nbreaks down very frequently, and<br />\nwhile sometimes the service<br />\nelevator is operated by a<br />\nmaintenance man, on late nights<br />\nand weekends, when the elevator<br />\nseems to enjoy breaking down,<br />\nresidents are forced to walk. This<br />\nis not a big deal if you live on the<br />\nsecond floor and have no heavy<br />\nbooks, but otherwise, the<br />\nI malfunctioning elevator can be<br />\nnot only a nuisance but a health<br />\nhazard. Until the elevator has<br />\nproven itself reliabie, we don't<br />\nsuggest taking an apartment on<br />\nthe upper floors.<br />\n<br />\nThe apartments are large and<br />\nthe front apartments offer a<br />\nbeautiful view of campus. Unfortunately closet space is at a<br />\nminimum. The bathrooms are ancient, but functional. The kitchens are small, but adequate,<br />\nespecially for a family of roaches.<br />\nAlthough the building does not<br />\nsuffer from a severe roach problem, some tenants claim that attempts to fumigate are useless and<br />\nthat a major health problem<br />\nexists.<br />\nLaundry facilities contain four<br />\nwashing machines ($1 each) and<br />\nfour dryers ($.75 each) and you<br />\ncan usually get a machine or two,<br />\nif you're willing to do your laundry at unusual hours. However,<br />\nthe laundry room is in the basement, therefore your plans are<br />\nsubject to the whims of the<br />\nelevator. Also in the basement is<br />\nP.J.'s Pub, a must for sports fans.<br />\nOn any given night you can catch<br />\ncollege and pro basketball,<br />\nhockey and a variety of other<br />\nsports.<br />\nMost maintenance problems<br />\nare usually addressed promptly,<br />\nbut due to the age of the building<br />\nand its plumbing, many problems<br />\nrecur. The management is<br />\nperceived asbeing unresponsive<br />\nand as not treating the students as.<br />\nserious tenants. As a result, both<br />\n<br />\nmajor and minor complaints are<br />\ndismissed. The overall attitude<br />\nseems to be that of a lack of<br />\nrespect for the residents that pay<br />\nthe management's salaries.<br />\nThe building is about 80%<br />\nstudents, but don't expect the<br />\nopen door friendliness of the<br />\ndorms. After all, The Charles is<br />\na private apartment building. The<br />\nsecurity system could use improvement, because if you look<br />\ninnocent enough, eventually<br />\nsomeone will let you into the<br />\nbuilding. The front door has been<br />\nknown to be propped open during the day. The hallways are<br />\ndarker than desirable, creating the<br />\npossibility for further security<br />\nproblems. The management has<br />\ntaken steps in this direction by<br />\nhiring a friendly night security<br />\nguard.<br />\nOverall, if you are looking for<br />\na more acceptable alternative to<br />\nUniversity housing, and you are<br />\nwilling to compromise low prices<br />\nand other amenities, such as<br />\nresponsive management and<br />\nmaintenance, for the conveniences of rolling out of bed,<br />\nplaying Charles Street rush how<br />\ntraffic roulette, and going straight<br />\nto class, then consider The<br />\nCharles as a viable option.<br />\n<br />\nThe Blackstone Apartments<br />\nSituated just across Charles<br />\nStreet from campus, the<br />\nBlackstone Apartments offer both<br />\nthe best and worst features of offcampus housing. Remarkable<br />\nconvenience (less than three<br />\nminutes to campus)is balanced by<br />\nannoying shortcomings (three<br />\nminutes to campus assumes that<br />\nthe elevator has not gone south<br />\nfor the semester).<br />\nThe Blackstone's most attractive feature is undoubtedly its<br />\nproximity to campus. After a year<br />\nin the nearly-incestuous dorms,<br />\nmany find the increased privacy<br />\nof apartment living nicely balanced with a walk to class that is<br />\noften shorter than it was from the of finding maintenance men<br />\ndormitories.<br />\nloitering in their apartment (one<br />\nAlthough the floor plans vary, resident. came back after a break<br />\nthe apartments are generally to find that maintenance had been<br />\nspacious and have plenty of win- ,using his refrigerator to keep<br />\ndows to help dissipate those beer), although rarely when there<br />\nwinter blahs.

After 20<br />\nyears of practicing professional<br />\nmedicine in hospitals, Dr. Joseph<br />\nJ.

Last year in Florida's<br />\nDade County the average<br />\nmalpractice insurance premium<br />\nwas $165,000\u2014up, in just four<br />\nyears, from $30,000. Fully onequarter of Florida physicians are<br />\nsued each year; in 1986 the<br />\naverage jury award was<br />\n$250,000.

In 1985, a national survey by<br />\nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists indicated<br />\nthat one-third of the nation's<br />\nobstetricians had been sued at one<br />\ntime or another during their<br />\npractice.<br />\nCourtesy<br />\nNewsletter<br />\n<br />\nLocum<br />\n<br />\nTen ens<br />\n<br />\nA Johns Hopkins University<br />\nprofessor is working on an artificial blood substitute that may<br />\none day make mass donations<br />\nunnecessary.<br />\nBiology professor Gary<br />\nAckers is an expert on<br />\nhemoglobin, the oxygencarrying protein in red blood<br />\ncells.

The 64-26 victory<br />\nput the Blue Jays back on the winning track after a tough loss to nationally ranked Franklin & Marshall on Saturday.<br />\nLast night's victory over the<br />\nFlying Dutchwomen leaves<br />\nHopkins at 7-6 on the season. The<br />\nwin was a turning point in<br />\nHopkins's play after, according to<br />\nCoach Nancy Blank, \"a shaky<br />\nstart in the new year.\" The Lady<br />\nJays, with strong efforts by<br />\nsophomore Beth Donnelly (sixteen points) and freshman Kern<br />\nMcTiernan (twelve points), completely overwhelmed their opponents, outscoring them 30-14<br />\nin the first half. According to<br />\nDonnelly, \"We finally pulled<br />\ntogether and played like we knew<br />\nwe could.\"<br />\nComing out of the locker room<br />\nwith a comfortable lead, the Lady<br />\nJays suffered a breakdown in concentration. Hopkins went<br />\nscoreless for eight minutes, until<br />\nDonnelly hit two free throws and<br />\nthe Lady Jays set up full-court<br />\npressure. According to Coach<br />\nBlank, \"we worked hard to take<br />\nthem out of their offense.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays did just that,<br />\n<br />\nconverting Lebanon Valley errors<br />\ninto Hopkins baskets. Freshman<br />\nJulie Slye continued her good<br />\nplay, scoring 10 points and pulling down 7 rebounds for the Lady<br />\nJays. McTiernan dished out 3<br />\nassists and recorded 3 steals,<br />\nwhile Williams (six points) added six steals and two assists.<br />\nSophomore co-captains Kristi<br />\nKantowski and Julianne Rolapp<br />\ncontributed six and ten points<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nCoach Blank was pleased with<br />\nher team's performance. \"We<br />\nneeded to see our regulars do<br />\nwell, especially since we have<br />\nbeen struggling since we've been<br />\nback from break.\"<br />\nLast Saturday, the Lady Jays<br />\nfell 62-50 in a hard-fought bout<br />\nwith tenth-ranked Franklin &<br />\nMarshall. Julie Slye had her best<br />\nday as a Blue Jay, scoring fifteen<br />\npoints and pulling down fifteen<br />\nrebounds. Tracy Jo Williams add;<br />\ned twelve points in the losing effort, which was much closer than<br />\nthe final score indicates. According to Coach Blank,' It (the<br />\ngame) went all the way to the<br />\nfinal four minutes. It was a four<br />\npoint game all the way through<br />\nuntil the end. The twelve point<br />\nfinish wasn't indicative of the<br />\nplay.\"<br />\nThe Lady Jays did, however,<br />\nmanage to put an end to F & M's<br />\nAnne Krumvine's attempt to<br />\nbreak the NCAA Division III<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS<br />\nHOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nrecord for consecutive field goals<br />\n(sixteen). The Hopkins defense<br />\nplayed her tightly, causing her to<br />\nmiss her first shot and go 3 for<br />\n7 on the night.<br />\nLast Thursday night's game at<br />\nSwarthmore resulted in an 80-42<br />\nvictory for the Lady Jays. Kantowski and Rolapp led all scoring<br />\nwith sixteen apiece. Kantowski<br />\nalso went 6 for 7 from the free<br />\nthrow line. McKiernan and Slye<br />\ncontributed to the win with fifteen<br />\nand ten points respectively. Slye<br />\nalso pulled down a game-high 8<br />\nrebounds, while Williams led<br />\nHopkins in assists and steals with<br />\nfour each.<br />\nPrevious games include an<br />\naway win at Lebanon Valley, a<br />\n46-60 loss at home to NYU, a<br />\nvictory by forfeit over Notre<br />\nDame, and a 60-82 loss at<br />\nCarnegie-Mellon.<br />\nAt last count, Kantowski leads<br />\nthe Hopkins women in scoring<br />\nwith 13.2 points per game. Kelly<br />\nVan Houten has grabbed a teamhigh 5.9 rebounds per game, and<br />\nWilliams is leading the team in<br />\nfree throw percentage shooting at<br />\n76% (13 for 17) from the line.<br />\nMcTiernan leads the Lady Jays in<br />\nboth steals and assists with 42 and<br />\n61 respectively. 6'3\" Julie Slye<br />\nhas seventeen blocked shots to<br />\nher credit.<br />\nThe next home game for the<br />\nHopkins women is Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 4th at 6:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nCARNEGIE<br />\nMELLON<br />\n<br />\n'WHAT7<br />\nYC32.3B TJ'Ar CCalVEIP.A.CT DISCS<br />\nItCPT.J\u2022NTE NEVER.

Coach Oles was unsure<br />\nhow the young Jays, with only<br />\ntwo seniors in its starting line-up<br />\nof nine fencers, would hold up<br />\nunder the pressure of its tough<br />\nschedule. The team's inexperience has shown itself in the<br />\nlast nine meets as they have<br />\nposted a 4 - 5 mark, dropping<br />\ntheir overall record to 6 - 5.<br />\nHopkins has defeated the University of California at San Diego,<br />\nCCNY, Lafayette, and NET,<br />\nwhile losing to UNC, MIT,<br />\nHunter, Baruch, and St. Johns.<br />\nThe Foil team has been fencing<br />\nwell after a disappointing ninth<br />\nplace finish at the USFA Collegiate Nationals, held on the first<br />\nweekend in January. Since then,<br />\nthe team is 4-2 and is getting better with each meet. The Blue Jays<br />\nare led by Senior Co-captain<br />\nDavid Cohen who was 23-4 during the intersession meets and<br />\nraised his overall record to 28-4.<br />\nJuniors Mike Greenfield and Yen<br />\nLen Tang were each inconsistent<br />\nat the start of their first full<br />\nseason, but they have come on<br />\nstrong as of late. They each<br />\nposted 5-9 records during the<br />\nbreak and now have 7-11 and<br />\n10-9 records respectively.<br />\nFreshman Rich Millhiser took<br />\nsome time to adjust to college fencing, but he has rebounded from<br />\na 5-9 start to even his record at<br />\n12-12. Sophomores Li Kou Kong<br />\nand Peter Liu have each shown<br />\npromise for the future with<br />\nrecords of 3-1 and 1-1<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAfter a strong sixth place showing at the USFA Collegiate Na-<br />\n<br />\ntionals, the Epee team has been<br />\non an unexplained roller coaster<br />\nride. Hopkins has been led by<br />\nSenior Co-captain Robert Lee and<br />\nSophomore Andrew Donnalley,<br />\nwho had impressive thirteenth<br />\nand fourteenth individual<br />\nplacements at the Collegiate Nationals. But they too have met<br />\nwith the puzzling inconsistency<br />\nthat afflicts the rest of the team,<br />\nas they have posted 15-14 and<br />\n10-7 marks respectively.<br />\nSophomore Ian Held has been<br />\nshowing signs of breaking out of<br />\nan early season slump, as he raised his record to 14-12.<br />\nSophomore Tim Train started<br />\nslowly by losing his first two varsity bouts, but he has shown promise while raising his record to<br />\n7-4. Sophomore Daniel Weaver<br />\nhas also shown flashes of<br />\ngreatness, but his inexperience<br />\nhas lead to inconsistency and a<br />\n6-9 record so far this season.<br />\nBoth Train and Weaver show extreme promise as their experience<br />\ngrows; later, so will their winning percentages.<br />\nThe Sabre team has been gaining their experience the hard way.<br />\nAt the end of last semester,junior<br />\nCo-captain Andrew Jablonowski<br />\nwas sidelined for more than a<br />\nmonth with a partially-torn hamstring. The team then finished tenth at the National Collegiates and has been trying to<br />\nregroup while gaining some much<br />\nneeded bouting experience. At<br />\nthe forefront is Junior Dave<br />\nHowe, who is the most experienced member of this young<br />\nteam. He has fenced well in his<br />\nfirst full year as a starter and has<br />\nposted a record of 18-14.<br />\nSophomores Peter Kim and John<br />\nO'Connell are understandably in-<br />\n<br />\nconsistent due to their inexperience and have posted marks<br />\nof 9-15 and 11-12 respectively.<br />\nSophomore Juan Suros has also 4,<br />\nbeen gaining experience and has<br />\na 2-7 record so far this season.<br />\nThis weekend the Jays will take.V<br />\nto the road to take on MAC foes<br />\nHaverford and Stevens.

Explained Kieffer, \"I don't think we<br />\ncould have reached varsity level<br />\n<br />\nif we didn't have rowers returning for their second, third, and<br />\nfourth years. A few years ago<br />\ncrew was an activity students<br />\njoined for a semester or two; now<br />\nthat isn't the case.\"<br />\nThere are several obstacles the<br />\nrowing team has had to overcome<br />\nand will continually face in the<br />\nfuture. Because crew is a yearround sport, it consumes a considerable amount of time.<br />\n\"Students find it difficult to<br />\ndevote so much time to a sport<br />\nwhich isn't even varsity,\" said<br />\nteam treasurer Jonathan Hubbard.<br />\n\"The added prestige, confidence,<br />\nand crucial monetary support<br />\nshould encourage an even greater<br />\nnumber of rowers to return each<br />\nyear, which means a better team<br />\nand more victories on the water.\"<br />\nFaulkingham listed the accomplishments and conditions<br />\nwhich helped bring crew to varsity level. Upon the retirement of<br />\nformer coach Doug \"Tiger\"<br />\n<br />\nSergeant, two coaches were hired<br />\nin his place. Steve Perry, a successful rower with the Baltimore<br />\nRowing Club (BRC), will coach<br />\nthe varsity boats, while Joe Gatto, a rower and coxswain with the<br />\nBRC, will take on the novices(or<br />\nfirst-year rowers). A recent grant<br />\nfrom the Alumni Association<br />\nallowed the purchase of a new<br />\neight-man shell, in order to allow<br />\nfor expansion of the program.<br />\nAlso, a year ago the team moved<br />\ninto the city owned Waterview<br />\nPark Boathouse, which it shares<br />\nwith the BRC, Loyola, and<br />\nUniversity of Baltimore crews.<br />\nPreviously the crew was housed<br />\nin a dilapidated, abandoned<br />\nwarehouse which was \"not only<br />\nunsafe and impractical, but also<br />\ndemoralizing.\" Finally, several<br />\npieces of equipment have recently been purchased, such as a new<br />\ntrailer for transporting shells to<br />\nregattas, new motor launches,<br />\nand rowing machines, all of<br />\n<br />\n**************************************************<br />\n<br />\nwhich improve the quality of the<br />\nteam.<br />\nAccording to Faulkingham,<br />\n\"reaching varsity status allows us<br />\nto redirect our energies to training, and ultimately winning more<br />\nraces.\" Hopkins's racing season<br />\nbegins April 1, and will continue<br />\nevery weekend until May, when<br />\nthe regional championship, the<br />\n<br />\nDad Vail Regatta, is held. Both<br />\ncaptains expressed their goal of<br />\nbettering last year's success of<br />\nhaving two boats qualify for the<br />\nsemi-finals.

But what if<br />\nthe Irish had lost? What if West<br />\nVirginia had won while Miami<br />\nwas crushing Nebraska in the<br />\nOrange Bowl? Who would have<br />\nwon the title then?<br />\nIndeed, Notre Dame saved the<br />\nNCAA and the pollsters from a<br />\nlot of controversy. But it<br />\nshouldn't have to be that way.<br />\nWhy must the NCAA rely on the<br />\nluck of the draw in bowl games<br />\nto determine the national champion of college football? It's<br />\nabout time that Division I football<br />\nadopted a playoff system to<br />\nmine the national champion.<br />\nThis idea shouldn't seem so<br />\nstrange. After all, every other<br />\nDivision in NCAA football uses<br />\na playoff system. Coaching giants<br />\nsuch as Joe Paterno and Vince<br />\nDooley have supported a post-<br />\n<br />\nseason tournament for years. The<br />\nNCAA has got to take the power<br />\naway form the polls and make<br />\nteams prove they're number one<br />\nby winning the championship on<br />\nthe field.<br />\nWhen you think about it, it<br />\nwouldn't be very difficult to arrange a post-season playoff.<br />\nMerely take the top six teams in<br />\nthe polls at the end of the season,<br />\ngive the top two teams a first<br />\nround bye, and have three play<br />\nsix and four play five. The winner of three vs. six would play<br />\nnumber two in the semifinals<br />\nwhile the winner of four vs. five<br />\nwould play the top ranked team.<br />\nThe winners of these two games<br />\nwould then square off for the national title. It's simple. No vote,<br />\nno controversy, and a true national champion.<br />\nOf course, there will still be<br />\nsome controversy over who gets<br />\nranked where, especially when it<br />\ncomes to the final playoff spot.<br />\nThis is where the NCAA steps in.<br />\nIf the polls don't agree on the top\u2022<br />\n<br />\nsix teams or if there is a split over<br />\nwho gets the sixth spot, the NCA<br />\nwill intervene to select the six<br />\nteams and their seeds. It's better<br />\nto have the NCAA make those<br />\nvital decisions anyway, so that<br />\nbiased sports writers and coaches<br />\nare kept out of the picture.<br />\nAnother important question<br />\narises: will the bowl system be<br />\nhurt by all this? The answer is an<br />\nemphatic no. The playoff system<br />\nwould basically rely on five key<br />\ngames, which can be divided<br />\namong the Rose, Fiesta, Cotton,<br />\nSugar, and Orange Bowls. Each<br />\nof these five bowls will take turns<br />\ngetting the national championship<br />\ngame. The excitement of a sudden death playoff will draw larger<br />\ncrowds, more media, and more<br />\nincome than the present system.<br />\nAs for the lower bowls (the<br />\nCitrus, Gator, Holiday, etc.),<br />\nthey can still exist by inviting the<br />\nteams which don't make the<br />\nplayoffs. Let's face it, the teams<br />\nthat these bowls invite now are<br />\nnot national championship con-<br />\n<br />\nPAT'S PICKS<br />\nMy final record was 92-79-2, a<br />\nwinnning percentage of 0.538. I<br />\nguess that means you could have<br />\nwon some money if you bet with me,<br />\nunless you put extra money on my<br />\nSuper Bowl and National Championship picks, in which case you lost<br />\nyour shirt.<br />\nBut just because the football<br />\nseason has ended, don't think that<br />\nyou've seen the last of PAT'S PICKS.<br />\nI will thrill you by picking the NCAA<br />\nhoops tourney, the NBA and NHL<br />\nplayoffs, and whatever else I think of.<br />\ntenders anyway. The lower bowls<br />\nwill have just as much<br />\nsignificance as they do today.<br />\nOne problem with the playoff<br />\nsystem is that it adds as many as<br />\nthree games to a schedule which<br />\nis already difficult both physically<br />\n<br />\nKI/s8NASE /11/581ASE Kt/scar'<br />\nYT<br />\nIF IT'S HOT ON THE CHARTS IT'S ON SALE AT<br />\n<br />\nBIA<br />\nNews<br />\n<br />\nSQUARECIRCLE<br />\nSALE THRU 1/31/1<br />\n7<br />\nAz44<br />\n<br />\nzk- qr<br />\n<br />\nARTIST<br />\nTITLE<br />\n<br />\n(d<br />\n<br />\n1 all<br />\n<br />\n2 10<br />\n3 7<br />\n,<br />\n4 12<br />\n5 14<br />\n6 10<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n10 7<br />\n<br />\nJULIAN COPE<br />\nMY NATION UNDERGROUND'<br />\nR.E.M.<br />\nGREEN<br />\nTHE WATERBOYS<br />\nFISHERMAN'S BLUES<br />\nU2<br />\nRATTLE & HUM<br />\nCAMOUFLAGE<br />\nVOICES AND IMAGES<br />\nTHE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS<br />\nLOVE JUNK<br />\nNEW ORDER<br />\nTECHNIQUE<br />\nMARC ALMOND<br />\nTHE STARS WE ARE<br />\nCOWBOY JUNKIES<br />\nTHE TRINITY SESSION<br />\nA HOUSE<br />\n\u2022N \u2022 RBI FAT MERRY\u2014 \u2022 R\u2022UND<br />\n<br />\nrt<br />\n<br />\nOA4:: -<br />\n<br />\ntr g<br />\nC, \u2022/<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\n44,<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\nto 4q<br />\n<br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n6.9910.99<br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n<br />\n10.9912.99<br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n6.9910.99<br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n,<br />\n6.9910.99<br />\n6.9910.99<br />\n<br />\nLANE<br />\n<br />\nSr<br />\nE4C<br />\nBALTIMORE,hSPRING) (l889-3855<br />\nCIRCLE<br />\n<br />\nand academically.

Interest on the new<br />\nphysics building, whose cost was<br />\nexpected to be covered by contracts from NASA once the space<br />\ntelescope was launched, is beginning to come due this year. The<br />\ntelescope is not expected to be<br />\nlaunched until at least 1990.<br />\nLloyd Armstrong, dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, said the \"independence and entrepreneurial<br />\nspirit, where each division goes<br />\nout and fights the world, not other<br />\ndivisions for money in a pot,\" is<br />\nfundamental to Hopkins's<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nArmstrong recognized, however that the University must<br />\nstrike a \"compromise between<br />\ncomplete independence and a<br />\nrealization that independence<br />\ndoesn't make that much sense.<br />\nThere is no school of Arts and<br />\nSciences in a research university<br />\nthat can break even in the current<br />\nfinancial situation in the country.<br />\nThat is why it is clear that it<br />\nmakes no sense to have complete<br />\nindependence.<br />\nSince the School of Advanced<br />\nInternational Studies, Hygiene<br />\nand Public Health, and Nursing<br />\n\"virtually break even,\" the<br />\nG.W.C.

Hence, if<br />\ntuition were to rise to $13,000<br />\nnext year for the classes of<br />\n1990, 1991, and 1992, the<br />\nClass of 1993 would pay<br />\n$14,000.<br />\nAfter four years, all<br />\nundergraduate classes will<br />\nagain pay the same tuition,<br />\nalbeit at a higher level. If incoming classes have approximately 800 students each,<br />\nassuming no enrollment<br />\ngrowth for the G.W.C.<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering, the University will gain<br />\n$800,000 for the first year of<br />\nthis<br />\nprogram,<br />\nthen<br />\n$1,600,000, then $2,400,000,<br />\nand $3,200,000 for each year<br />\nthereafter.<br />\nGraduate students who do<br />\nnot teach classes will also face<br />\nsimilar bi-level tuition plans,<br />\nthough their tuition, which<br />\ncurrently equals that of undergraduates, will be stepped<br /><br />\nup to a level slightly below<br />\nthat of future undergraduates.<br />\nArts and Sciences Dean<br />\nLloyd Armstrong explained,<br />\n\"We looked at tuition structures of other universities, and<br />\nwe felt our tuition was lower<br />\nthan other universities we<br />\nwere competing with. We felt<br />\nwe had a commitment to people who were here not to raise<br />\ntuition too rapidly.\"<br />\nThe proposal to increase the<br />\nnumber of graduates supported by teaching service, if<br />\nenacted, will increase the<br />\nnumber of graduate students<br />\nwho teach courses at Hopkins.<br />\nArmstrong stressed, however,<br />\nthat the graduates will not<br />\nreplace professors as teachers.<br />\n\"There are some areas<br />\nwhere you will be likely to see<br />\ngraduate students teaching<br />\ncourses, but they will be<br />\ncourses not being taught at<br />\npresent,\" he said. \"We will<br />\ntry to broaden the number of<br />\ncourses, some of which are<br />\nappropriately taught by advanced graduate students. I do<br />\nnot anticipate you will see<br />\ngraduates replacing faculty in<br />\nexisting courses.\"<br />\nArmstrong declined to<br />\nelaborate, however, on how<br />\nthe ten percent decline over<br />\nfive years in Arts and<br />\nSciences' faculty will impact<br />\nupon the number of professors<br />\navailable to teach courses.<br /><br />\nContinuing Studies \"produce<br />\nsmall positive balances,\" and<br />\nMedicine \"have substantial<br />\npositive balances to support their<br />\ngrowth, maintain stability, and<br />\nfund commitments to facilities<br />\nand programs,\" the plan is<br />\ndesigned primarily to help Arts<br />\nand Sciences and The Peabody<br />\nConservatory, \"two Hopkins<br />\nunits [that] show chronic underfunded balances.\"<br />\nThe plan also attempts to<br />\nreduce the University's commitment to a series of \"special projects\" it has undertaken over the<br />\npast few years to \"little or<br />\nnothing\" in five years.<br />\nThese include WJHU-FM, the<br />\nChesapeake Bay Institute, the Institute For Policy Studies, the<br />\nHopkins-Nanjing Center, the<br />\nMind/Brain Institute, Hopkins's<br />\nshare of an eight meter groundbased telescope consortium, and<br />\nEvergreen and Homewood<br />\nHouses.<br />\nThe administration has said it<br />\nwants to \"maintain a viable,<br />\nresearch-intensive, tightly focused, and internationally competitive division of Arts and<br />\nSciences and achieve a steady<br />\nstate budget by 1993.\"<br />\nArmstrong said, \"Speaking<br />\njust in terms of faculty positions<br />\nis an unnecessarily stark way to<br />\nview the process,\" he continued.<br />\nIf no savings are to be found, then<br />\nthe plan is to cut the faculty by<br />\nfive per year for five years. On<br />\naverage, up to fifteen die, retire<br />\nor leave each year. So there is<br />\nconsiderable flexibility in the<br />\nDean's office to move positions<br />\naround and to strengthen positions that need to be strengthened.<br />\n\"One of the major concerns is<br />\nthat there are sufficient faculty to<br />\nteach the student loads that appear, to give the quality education<br />\nthat students deserve,\" he went<br />\non. No institution can remain<br />\ngreat by just standing still or<br />\nallowing growth or changes in<br />\nsize to occur at random.\"<br />\nAs to whether these cuts would<br />\nhurt the University's ability to retain and attract star faculty, Armstrong responded, \"There are<br />\nareas that we will pick as being<br />\nof prime importance that we will<br />\nmaintain or increase in excellence. To find the resources<br />\nfor these, other areas will be cut<br />\nback.

Armstrong added that the<br />\nschool will still have a low student to faculty ratio of 10 to 1,<br />\nup from 8 to 1. The job of his office would be to alleviate the<br />\n\"bumps and clumps\" that appear<br />\nin it.<br />\nThe plan also calls for the<br />\npostponement of the construction<br />\nof a new chemistry building to<br />\nreplace Remsen Hall, although it<br />\npromises to fund \"essential<br />\nrenovations for safety and funded research.\" Posner said the<br />\ndepartment has documented promises from the administration,<br />\ndating back to the 1930s and<br />\n1940s to fix electricity and water<br /><br />\nproblems that have yet to be<br />\nrectified.<br />\nAccording to the chairman,<br />\nRemsen has serious safety problems in the form of water spills,<br />\nproblems with the water heating,<br />\nand pressure causing stopped or<br />\nburst- tubing resulting in instrumentation damage and experimentation fallacies. It also has<br />\nserious efficiency problems<br />\nwhere research groups are<br />\n\"bursting at the seams\" and programming is. hampered.<br />\nAccording to Posner, the- administration assured him that<br />\nmoney was set aside for construction of a new building despite the<br />\nschool's budgetary problems.<br />\nAsked whether he expects construction to be completed on time,<br />\nhe responded that that \"remains<br />\nto be seen.\"<br />\nThe plan also calls for the<br />\nMilton S.

Rather, they believe Hopkins's<br />\nfinancial ills stem not from overexpansion<br />\nor poor decisions, but from revenue shortages resulting from bad timing and unexpectedly small donations to certain University divisions.<br />\nNot enough revenue<br /><br />\ncare, liability insurance, and conforming<br />\nto stricter Federal health and safety standards. Another major cost, according to<br />\nEugene Sunshine, senior vice president for<br />\n'administration and treasurer, was Hopkins's<br />\ndesire to maintain its competitiveness with<br />\nother research universities.<br />\n\"If you want to be competitive for the<br />\nkinds of faculty and students we want to<br />\nmaintain and recruit,\" he explained,<br />\n\"there's a significant cost element<br />\nassociated with that, and that manifests<br />\nitself in terms of capital facilities, salaries,<br />\nand student aid. The University financial<br />\ncondition might be a lot different if we<br />\ndidn't have such high standards.\"<br />\nLike other universities, Hopkins cannot<br />\ndip into its permanent endowment to fund<br />\nprojects. Hopkins may spend only the endowment's earnings and its \"quasiendowment,\" funds given to the University for program support that are treated<br />\nas endowment for the purposes of investment but are available for spending.<br /><br />\nProvost John Lombardi explained, \"Insofar as the University's financial adjustment can be tracked, it tracks to a combination of two or three important<br />\nphenomena. The first is the need to<br />\nrenovate our physical plant in all parts of<br />\nthe University.<br />\n\"When we look to find the money to<br />\nsupport the building, we look for three or<br />\nfour different sources: research funding,<br />\ndonations from major capital campaigns,<br />\nand some amount of support from the state<br />\ngovernment,\" he continued. \"What happened to Hopkins has been a lag in the timing of the commitment to build the<br />\nbuildings and the production of those<br />\nrevenue sources.\"<br />\nRecalling the telescope, Lombardi said<br />\nHopkins would have attracted many<br />\nresearch grants in the astronomy field had<br />\nthe telescope been launched. Until the<br />\ntelescope's launch, now scheduled for<br />\nsome time in 1990, much of the new<br />\nphysics building, which had been designed to accomodate that research, will be<br />\nunused.<br />\nA second unanticipated revenue shortage<br />\ncomes from the University's current<br />\ncapital campaign. Though Hopkins has<br />\neasily surpassed its original $450 million<br />\ngoal and is steaming toward a new $600<br />\nmillion target, the dollars have not been<br />\ndonated as the University had wished.<br />\n\"The distribution of the $450 million<br />\ndoes not match exactly our plans,\" said<br />\nLombardi. \"In the end, it's the donors who<br />\ndecide what the money goes to. If the<br />\ndonor says, 'I want to buy cancer,' that's<br />\nwhat you have to buy. The total is all right,<br />\nbut it isn't distributed as we would have<br />\nideally determined had it been up to us. We<br />\nthink we'll get the money we need for Arts<br />\nand Sciences, doubling the school's endowment, but it will take considerably<br />\nlonger than we anticipated.\"<br />\nArts and Sciences's endowment, about<br />\n$100 million, represents about one-fifth of<br />\nHopkins's endowment, proportionately less<br />\nthan at comparable research universities.<br />\nHopkins, like other universities, also<br />\nfaced substantially increased costs in health<br /><br />\nA&amp;S feels the pinch<br />\nArmstrong and Lombardi first noticed<br />\nArts and Sciences's problems shortly after<br />\nArmstrong assumed his deanship in the<br />\nsummer of 1987.<br />\nLombardi recalled, \"We came to the<br />\nconclusion that it was not possible to deal<br />\nwith this [problem] simply by saying to<br />\nArts and Sciences, 'Well guys, it's your<br />\nbuildings, your money, you suffer,'<br />\nbecause to say that would have destroyed<br />\nArts and Sciences as a viable school.<br />\n\"In the Hopkins tradition there was<br />\nsome argument that that's what we should<br />\nhave done; in the Hopkins tradition every<br />\ntub has its own bottom and you say,<br />\n'Arts and Sciences, tough luck,<br />\nthe Shuttle blew up, you guys close,\"<br />\nhe continued. \"This is not sensible because everybody at Hopkins<br />\nrecognizes that there is no university<br />\nwithout Arts and Sciences in good shape.\"<br />\nConsequently, maintained Sunshine,<br />\nmost major research universities subsidize<br />\ntheir arts and sciences schools, which<br />\nwould otherwise not survive on their own.<br />\nDipping into its University discretionary<br />\nfund, Hopkins usually achieves this end.<br />\nHopkins, though, has long prided<br />\nitself on its divisions maintaining selfsufficiency, and Arts and Sciences clearly<br /><br />\nThe University Reserve Fund<br /><br />\nMedicine<br />\nEngineering<br />\nContinuing Studies<br />\nHygiene/Public Health<br />\nSA1S<br />\nNursing<br />\nTotal<br /><br />\nDivisional 'Total 5 Year<br />\nAdjustment Contribution<br />\n-14.0%<br />\n26.1%<br />\n76.7%<br />\n-70.4%<br />\n-59.7%<br />\n-87.50/0<br />\n-17.7%<br /><br />\n23.49<br />\n3.07<br />\n0.86<br />\n4.32<br />\n0.72<br />\n0.32<br />\n32.78<br /><br />\n20.00<br />\n3.87<br />\n1.52<br />\n1.27<br />\n0.29<br />\n0.04<br />\n26.99<br /><br />\nThe index formula represents the sum of one percent of tuition, fifty<br />\npercent of the earnings on the University's working capital, and five<br />\npercent of indirect cost recoveries.<br /><br />\ncould not. \"The exercise of the Five Year.<br />\nPlan to a large extent was to determine<br />\nwhether it was possible to have a<br />\nUniversity-wide solution to the financial<br />\nchallenge that did not destroy the selfsufficiency and the academic independence<br />\nof the divisions. We believe it does achieve<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nAt Hopkins, said Armstrong, Arts and<br />\nSciences gets its revenue primarily from<br />\nundergraduate, federal reimbursement of<br />\nindirect costs of research, interest on its<br />\nendowment, and a small amount of state<br />\naid. The problem, he said, has been that<br />\nrevenues have increased lately at approximately the inflation rate, while expenses<br />\nhave increased much faster.<br />\nArmstrong said, however, that the<br />\nschool has not grown too fast, explaining,<br />\n\"Our competitors have been growing at a<br />\nreasonably rapid rate, while Arts and<br />\nSciences has not. [Still,] we don't have to<br />\ncompete on a numerical basis. In terms of<br />\nour resource base, we grew too fast. To<br />\nthe extent that competition is based on size,<br />\nwe should have grown more rapidly. To<br />\nthe extent it is based on quality of faculty<br />\nand good ideas, maybe we were growing<br />\nat the right size.\"<br />\nPeabody lacks donations<br />\nAs at Arts and Sciences, the Peabody<br />\nConservatory, which Lombardi said has<br />\nreceived a \"tremendous amount of<br /><br />\nMichael Blumhard<br /><br />\nNews-Letter file<br /><br />\nArts and Sciences Dean Lloyd Armstrong<br />\nsaid his school's revenues have not kept up<br />\nwith expenditures.<br /><br />\nIndex<br />\nFormula<br /><br />\nDivision<br /><br />\nProvost John Lombardi said Hopkins is<br />\nproud of its reputation as a risk-taking<br />\nuniversity.<br /><br />\nmoney\" from Hopkins to sustain its<br />\nreputation, has not received enough donations to maintain its current level of activity. Lombardi said Hopkins does not have<br />\nthe resources to continue subsidizing<br />\nPeabody's operations as it would like.<br />\n\"Hopkins cannot put Peabody's needs<br />\nat the top of the priority list for the institution,\" he said.<br />\nLombardi also explained that reductions<br />\nin University aid to enterprises such as the<br />\nChesapeake Bay Institute, the Institute for<br />\nPolicy Studies, the Nanjing Center, and<br />\nWJHU-FM had always been in the works.<br />\n\"The assumption always has been that<br />\nthese enterprises would receive finite support on a declining basis that would allow<br />\nthem to get started, get firm footing and<br />\na solid base, and then continue as selfsupporting enterprises,\" he said. \"What<br />\nhas never been shown before is an exact<br />\ntime-frame for that to occur.\"<br />\nHopkins as risk-taker<br />\nPerhaps the most telling characteristic of<br />\nHopkins, one that may be largely responsible for past success as well as current difficulties, is Hopkins's propensity to take<br />\nrisks.<br />\n\"Private entrepreneurial universities, if<br />\nthey are to be successful, must take risks,\"<br />\nsaid Lombardi. \"Hopkins is a risk-taking<br />\nuniversity.

When we celebrate it, though, we<br />\noften forget that risks means you try a lot<br />\nof things, and some of them may not be<br />\nself-sustainable.<br />\n\"It is not a symbol of mismanagement<br />\nthat risks don't all turn out 100 percent,\"<br />\nhe went on. \"If you take five risks, and<br />\nthree turn out to be successes, you're a<br />\nspectacular success.\"<br />\nLombardi said once Hopkins identifies<br />\nan operation that may be high quality but<br />\ndrains the University's resources, \"we<br />\npare back and readjust and say, 'All right,<br />\nwhat are some new risks we need to take,'<br />\nbecause that's part of being on the cutting<br />\nedge of research, teaching, and intellectual<br />\nenterprise.\"<br /><br />\nMoney-starved Peabody to lose much of support<br />\nPLAN, from 4<br />\nHouse and, if it does not sell it,<br />\nwill give WJHU $1.88 million.<br />\nProvost John Lombardi<br />\njustified the expense of these institutes, almost $2 million in 1987<br />\nand 1988 alone, characterizing<br />\nthem as risks that put the University \"at the cutting edge of some<br />\nresearch or service.\"<br /><br />\nAccording to Armstrong,<br />\n\"there is a consensus that the<br />\nUniversity is overextended.<br />\nThere is a real recognition of the<br />\ncost of what we have gotten into<br />\n' and I think the Five-Year plans<br />\nassesses this. If it turns out that<br />\nthis is not sufficient, something<br />\nelse must be done.\"<br />\nThe plan also calls for a scaling down of the University's sup-<br /><br />\nport for the Peabody institute<br />\nfrom almost $3 million annually<br />\nto $1 million.<br />\nAccording to Robert Pierce,<br />\ndirector of Peabody, \"the reception at the state has been positive<br />\nin the sense that there is<br />\nan understanding that Peabody<br />\nshould not be allowed to have its<br />\ndoors closed. What has not been<br />\nagreed upon is the method by<br /><br />\nwhich that is going to be<br />\nachieved.\"<br />\nPeabody suffers a much more<br />\nimmediate crisis than Arts and<br />\nSciences. Internally, it has been<br />\ndecided that Peabody will pursue<br />\nits own fund-raising only after<br />\nArts and Sciences, so as not to<br />\nconflict with its effort. The director also said he faces a much<br />\ngraver risk of faculty attrition and<br /><br />\nan inability to continue scholarship support enabling students to<br />\nbe able to afford to attend.<br />\nAccording to Pierce, \"I have<br />\nfaculty members calling me every<br />\nday with concern.

Triggered by the<br />\nnow infamous deficit in the School of Arts,<br />\nand Sciences, the plan was developed by<br />\na team of high-ranking administators in collaboration with principal members of the<br />\nHopkins community. The plan, claiming to<br />\nrepresent the \"collective understanding\"<br />\nof the participants, sets specific limits and<br />\ngoals for University resources and will<br />\nserve, barring rejection by the Board of.<br />\nTrustees, as the \"general blueprint\" for<br />\nresource allocation.<br />\nThe plan's proposal for financial reform<br />\ndepends on identification of and commitment to crucial divisions and programs<br />\nwithin those divisions: non-crucial programs and divisions wkll be phased out. The<br />\ntemporary creation of a reserve fund, to<br />\nwhich divisions will contribute, will serve \u2022<br />\nas a stop-gap measure to correct the immediate deficit. In this way, Johns Hopkins'<br />\nhallowed decentralized tradition will be<br />\npreserved.<br />\nArts and Sciences, as one of \"the original<br />\nstars in the Hopkins galaxy,\" will remain,<br />\nthe plan promises, a \"viable, research intensive, tightly focused and internationally competitive\" division. Yet, in order to<br />\nremain in the decentralized Hopkins galaxy,<br />\nArts and Sciences must toe the galactic<br />\nbudgetary line, and bring its deficit finances<br />\nunder control in the next five years by<br />\nreducing faculty size, increasing undergraduate enrollment, and postponing construction and renovation.<br />\nIt is the inherent contradiction between<br />\nobjective and adjustment that troubles us:<br />\nArts and Sciences cannot cut back its most<br />\nvital components and still hope to maintain<br />\nits high standards.<br />\nThe policy of faculty reduction through<br />\nattrition is one we find especially frightening. It has strained departments and has<br />\ncaused subsequent decline in diversity of<br />\ncourse offerings, even in this past semester.<br />\nFaculty members, disturbed by perceived<br /><br />\nnj<br /><br />\nMU,SILL, filow AfE<br />\n-THE cAteeR-omEmD<br />\n.f,vrEeviEws- Golly&amp;<br />\nDuo? Ar yogAS<br />\nHopehvS?<br /><br />\ndeclines in department prestige, can only<br />\nspeculate as to long term effects, and may<br />\nopt to leave. Certainly, as has been argued<br />\nin the past, this could diminish the number<br />\nand quality of students, both graduate and<br />\nundergraduate, that might choose Hopkins.<br />\nTo meet the gap left by a decrease in<br />\nfaculty, the plan calls for an increase in the<br />\nteaching loads of graduate students. It also<br />\nsuggests the use of non-permanent faculty<br />\nto meet the undergraduate need. Both solutions are undesirable. Visiting faculty, transient in nature, do not provide the constancy<br />\non which great departments are built. Furthermore, one questions the wisdom of using more graduate teaching assistants,<br />\nespecially given the recent fracas over their<br />\nlack of conversational English skills.<br />\nIn addition, the plan calls for increased<br />\nundergraduate enrollment as a source of<br />\nrevenue during the next few years. Combining an even greater student body with<br />\na decimated faculty only compounds the<br />\nproblems facing Arts and Sciences. Low<br />\nfaculty/student ratios, long touted as among<br />\nthe most positive aspects of a Hopkins<br />\neducation, will most certainly suffer.<br />\nIncreased student enrollment will exacerbate long-ignored Homewood woes such as<br />\ninadequate housing and student services.<br />\nFar be it from us to cry \"climate\" during<br />\nthis time of financial adversity, but with<br />\nmore crowded facilities and fewer faculty,<br />\nwe must be pessimistic about the University hoping to attain that ever-elusive sense<br />\nof \"goodwill\" .on campus.<br />\nIn short, the most attractive elements of<br />\na Hopkins undergraduate education\u2014<br />\nexcellent faculty, low faculty/student ratios,<br />\nand quality and diversity of class offerings<br />\nare in jeopardy. We fear a Pyrrhic victory.<br />\nAt ,the very least, we will be perilously<br />\nclose to sacrificing the very things we are<br />\nproudest of. We think that it will require<br />\ncreative management, if not a great deal<br />\nmore, to ensure that academic visions do<br />\nnot become obscured in the process of<br />\n\"reform\".<br /><br />\nJog-<br /><br />\nGREAT;<br />\n5IW IHF DIRE-Cr-0R OF<br />\nAGENCY<br />\nPLe4SeD! 511r..<br /><br />\nWett,<br />\noNE GvY<br />\nBILL GAATilY MD ro<br />\nPaR(46W...<br />\n566440<br />\n49(tr Mgr?<br /><br />\n-rewitzy wrerEsIED<br />\nIN BEING wrrN 7-NE.<br />\nBur..<br /><br />\npseudoperspicacity<br />\njonathan engler<br />\nIn light of the unique style of<br />\nsecurity which Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity has chosen to exercise<br />\non campus, I thought a revision<br />\nof Security suggestions for the<br />\nstudent body was in order.

Sidney Maskit<br />\nimplied such a charge against<br />\nGreg Francis in his December 9<br />\nletter in the News-Letter.<br />\nIf Mr. Francis is such an antiSemite (or even insensitive), why<br />\ndid he pledge support to the<br />\n\"Freedom Sunday\" march on<br />\nWashington, D.C. in December,<br />\n1987 which had the sole purpose<br />\nof encouraging human rights and<br />\nfreedom for Soviet Jews? Furthermore, why would a racist<br /><br />\nleader of an anti-Semitic group<br />\npledge his support for a chaplain<br />\nwho supports religious activities,<br />\nincluding funding for Jews and<br />\nany other religion, at a small<br />\nmeeting of only supporters in the<br />\nCR's, which obviously is a<br />\nsincere statement as it draws no<br />\npublicity?<br />\nIt is not my intention to be Mr.<br />\nFrancis' apologist. In fact, I was<br />\nvery disturbed by the way Mr.<br />\nMaskit used an insulting political<br />\nploy of his own. By invoking a<br />\nfear of anti-Semitism, a very sensitive issue, he tried to draw emotion against Greg Francis. Mr.<br />\nMaskit appears to think Jews are<br />\na poor, oppressed group which<br />\nneeds vigilant support against<br />\ndiscrimination. Thanks, but Greg<br />\nFrancis poses no immediate threat<br />\nand we can take care of ourselves<br />\nanyway.<br />\nInstead of invariably jumping<br />\non any apparent cause, people<br />\nsuch as Sidney Maskit may do<br />\nbetter by first checking facts. Any<br />\nrational thinker would know that<br />\nMr. Maskit was correct in classifying G. Gordon Liddy as \"an<br />\namusing lunatic\" (perhaps<br />\nMaskit's only correct statement)<br />\nand that the point is that neither<br />\nhe nor Hoffman belong in the<br />\nChaplain's budget.

It<br />\nis a myth that the ability to run<br />\nquickly, respond alertly, or project a strong presence in a tense<br />\nsituation is key to adequate campus protection.

According to Dean Colombo,<br />\n\"rape and armed assault usually<br />\noccur in the dead of night in areas<br />\nwhere people should not be walking, especially alone.\" Accordingly, note our Security Bulletin<br />\nof January 13: \"Additional<br />\npatrols are beginning immediately<br />\non all parking lots during peak<br />\npedestrian traffic hours.\"<br />\nGood luck, amigos.<br /><br />\nDespite such posted regulations, many students fail to<br />\nunderstand the unique methods<br />\nemployed by our Security in<br />\norder to thwart campus crime. In<br />\nresponse to this need, we have<br />\ncompiled a list of student quotes<br />\nwhich we feel reflect the low-key<br />\napproach we prefer to the guntoting, arrogant effectiveness of<br />\nother universities' security:<br />\nStudent A: \"I hardly ever see<br />\n6.

As the Arts and<br />\nSciences deficit cuts into<br />\neveryone's budget over the years<br />\nto come, a number of inexpensive<br />\noptions could possibly help to increase the presence of Security on<br />\ncampus, as well as promote a<br />\ngreater sense of safety.

It must be noted,<br />\nhowever, that the Charles prices<br />\ncompare favorably with housing<br />\nof the same proximity to campus.<br />\nincluding University housing.<br />\nThe Charles is one of the older<br />\nbuildings around, and lacks many<br />\nof the creature comforts that the<br />\nhigh prices warrant. There is no<br />\ntrash chute, so residents must take<br />\ntheir garbage down to the basement. This is not such an inconvenience, when (it) the infamous demon-possessed elevator<br />\nis in operation. De elevator<br />\nbreaks down very frequently, and<br />\nwhile sometimes the service<br />\nelevator is operated by a<br />\nmaintenance man, on late nights<br />\nand weekends, when the elevator<br />\nseems to enjoy breaking down,<br />\nresidents are forced to walk. This<br />\nis not a big deal if you live on the<br />\nsecond floor and have no heavy<br />\nbooks, but otherwise, the<br />\nI malfunctioning elevator can be<br />\nnot only a nuisance but a health<br />\nhazard. Until the elevator has<br />\nproven itself reliabie, we don't<br />\nsuggest taking an apartment on<br />\nthe upper floors.<br /><br />\nThe apartments are large and<br />\nthe front apartments offer a<br />\nbeautiful view of campus. Unfortunately closet space is at a<br />\nminimum. The bathrooms are ancient, but functional. The kitchens are small, but adequate,<br />\nespecially for a family of roaches.<br />\nAlthough the building does not<br />\nsuffer from a severe roach problem, some tenants claim that attempts to fumigate are useless and<br />\nthat a major health problem<br />\nexists.<br />\nLaundry facilities contain four<br />\nwashing machines ($1 each) and<br />\nfour dryers ($.75 each) and you<br />\ncan usually get a machine or two,<br />\nif you're willing to do your laundry at unusual hours.

The management is<br />\nperceived asbeing unresponsive<br />\nand as not treating the students as.<br />\nserious tenants. As a result, both<br /><br />\nmajor and minor complaints are<br />\ndismissed. The overall attitude<br />\nseems to be that of a lack of<br />\nrespect for the residents that pay<br />\nthe management's salaries.<br />\nThe building is about 80%<br />\nstudents, but don't expect the<br />\nopen door friendliness of the<br />\ndorms. After all, The Charles is<br />\na private apartment building. The<br />\nsecurity system could use improvement, because if you look<br />\ninnocent enough, eventually<br />\nsomeone will let you into the<br />\nbuilding. The front door has been<br />\nknown to be propped open during the day. The hallways are<br />\ndarker than desirable, creating the<br />\npossibility for further security<br />\nproblems. The management has<br />\ntaken steps in this direction by<br />\nhiring a friendly night security<br />\nguard.<br />\nOverall, if you are looking for<br />\na more acceptable alternative to<br />\nUniversity housing, and you are<br />\nwilling to compromise low prices<br />\nand other amenities, such as<br />\nresponsive management and<br />\nmaintenance, for the conveniences of rolling out of bed,<br />\nplaying Charles Street rush how<br />\ntraffic roulette, and going straight<br />\nto class, then consider The<br />\nCharles as a viable option.<br /><br />\nThe Blackstone Apartments<br />\nSituated just across Charles<br />\nStreet from campus, the<br />\nBlackstone Apartments offer both<br />\nthe best and worst features of offcampus housing. Remarkable<br />\nconvenience (less than three<br />\nminutes to campus)is balanced by<br />\nannoying shortcomings (three<br />\nminutes to campus assumes that<br />\nthe elevator has not gone south<br />\nfor the semester).<br />\nThe Blackstone's most attractive feature is undoubtedly its<br />\nproximity to campus.

After 20<br />\nyears of practicing professional<br />\nmedicine in hospitals, Dr. Joseph<br />\nJ.

Payment of the<br />\ndelayed premium was optional\u2014<br />\nbut if Merigo didn't pay it, and<br />\nwas later sued for something that<br />\nhappened in the intervening<br />\nperiod, he would not have been<br />\ncovered.<br />\nThe Massachusetts numbers<br />\nmay sound high, but they pale in<br />\ncomparison to those of, say,<br />\nFlorida. Last year in Florida's<br />\nDade County the average<br />\nmalpractice insurance premium<br />\nwas $165,000\u2014up, in just four<br />\nyears, from $30,000. Fully onequarter of Florida physicians are<br />\nsued each year; in 1986 the<br />\naverage jury award was<br />\n$250,000.

In 1985, a national survey by<br />\nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists indicated<br />\nthat one-third of the nation's<br />\nobstetricians had been sued at one<br />\ntime or another during their<br />\npractice.<br />\nCourtesy<br />\nNewsletter<br /><br />\nLocum<br /><br />\nTen ens<br /><br />\nA Johns Hopkins University<br />\nprofessor is working on an artificial blood substitute that may<br />\none day make mass donations<br />\nunnecessary.<br />\nBiology professor Gary<br />\nAckers is an expert on<br />\nhemoglobin, the oxygencarrying protein in red blood<br />\ncells.

The 64-26 victory<br />\nput the Blue Jays back on the winning track after a tough loss to nationally ranked Franklin &amp; Marshall on Saturday.<br />\nLast night's victory over the<br />\nFlying Dutchwomen leaves<br />\nHopkins at 7-6 on the season. The<br />\nwin was a turning point in<br />\nHopkins's play after, according to<br />\nCoach Nancy Blank, \"a shaky<br />\nstart in the new year.\" The Lady<br />\nJays, with strong efforts by<br />\nsophomore Beth Donnelly (sixteen points) and freshman Kern<br />\nMcTiernan (twelve points), completely overwhelmed their opponents, outscoring them 30-14<br />\nin the first half. According to<br />\nDonnelly, \"We finally pulled<br />\ntogether and played like we knew<br />\nwe could.\"<br />\nComing out of the locker room<br />\nwith a comfortable lead, the Lady<br />\nJays suffered a breakdown in concentration. Hopkins went<br />\nscoreless for eight minutes, until<br />\nDonnelly hit two free throws and<br />\nthe Lady Jays set up full-court<br />\npressure. According to Coach<br />\nBlank, \"we worked hard to take<br />\nthem out of their offense.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays did just that,<br /><br />\nconverting Lebanon Valley errors<br />\ninto Hopkins baskets. Freshman<br />\nJulie Slye continued her good<br />\nplay, scoring 10 points and pulling down 7 rebounds for the Lady<br />\nJays. McTiernan dished out 3<br />\nassists and recorded 3 steals,<br />\nwhile Williams (six points) added six steals and two assists.<br />\nSophomore co-captains Kristi<br />\nKantowski and Julianne Rolapp<br />\ncontributed six and ten points<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nCoach Blank was pleased with<br />\nher team's performance. \"We<br />\nneeded to see our regulars do<br />\nwell, especially since we have<br />\nbeen struggling since we've been<br />\nback from break.\"<br />\nLast Saturday, the Lady Jays<br />\nfell 62-50 in a hard-fought bout<br />\nwith tenth-ranked Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall. Julie Slye had her best<br />\nday as a Blue Jay, scoring fifteen<br />\npoints and pulling down fifteen<br />\nrebounds. Tracy Jo Williams add;<br />\ned twelve points in the losing effort, which was much closer than<br />\nthe final score indicates. According to Coach Blank,' It (the<br />\ngame) went all the way to the<br />\nfinal four minutes. It was a four<br />\npoint game all the way through<br />\nuntil the end. The twelve point<br />\nfinish wasn't indicative of the<br />\nplay.\"<br />\nThe Lady Jays did, however,<br />\nmanage to put an end to F &amp; M's<br />\nAnne Krumvine's attempt to<br />\nbreak the NCAA Division III<br /><br />\nJOHNS<br />\nHOPKINS<br /><br />\nrecord for consecutive field goals<br />\n(sixteen). The Hopkins defense<br />\nplayed her tightly, causing her to<br />\nmiss her first shot and go 3 for<br />\n7 on the night.<br />\nLast Thursday night's game at<br />\nSwarthmore resulted in an 80-42<br />\nvictory for the Lady Jays. Kantowski and Rolapp led all scoring<br />\nwith sixteen apiece. Kantowski<br />\nalso went 6 for 7 from the free<br />\nthrow line. McKiernan and Slye<br />\ncontributed to the win with fifteen<br />\nand ten points respectively. Slye<br />\nalso pulled down a game-high 8<br />\nrebounds, while Williams led<br />\nHopkins in assists and steals with<br />\nfour each.<br />\nPrevious games include an<br />\naway win at Lebanon Valley, a<br />\n46-60 loss at home to NYU, a<br />\nvictory by forfeit over Notre<br />\nDame, and a 60-82 loss at<br />\nCarnegie-Mellon.<br />\nAt last count, Kantowski leads<br />\nthe Hopkins women in scoring<br />\nwith 13.2 points per game. Kelly<br />\nVan Houten has grabbed a teamhigh 5.9 rebounds per game, and<br />\nWilliams is leading the team in<br />\nfree throw percentage shooting at<br />\n76% (13 for 17) from the line.<br />\nMcTiernan leads the Lady Jays in<br />\nboth steals and assists with 42 and<br />\n61 respectively. 6'3\" Julie Slye<br />\nhas seventeen blocked shots to<br />\nher credit.<br />\nThe next home game for the<br />\nHopkins women is Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 4th at 6:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nCARNEGIE<br />\nMELLON<br /><br />\n'WHAT7<br />\nYC32.3B TJ'Ar CCalVEIP.A.CT DISCS<br />\nItCPT.J\u2022NTE NEVER.

Explained Kieffer, \"I don't think we<br />\ncould have reached varsity level<br /><br />\nif we didn't have rowers returning for their second, third, and<br />\nfourth years. A few years ago<br />\ncrew was an activity students<br />\njoined for a semester or two; now<br />\nthat isn't the case.\"<br />\nThere are several obstacles the<br />\nrowing team has had to overcome<br />\nand will continually face in the<br />\nfuture. Because crew is a yearround sport, it consumes a considerable amount of time.<br />\n\"Students find it difficult to<br />\ndevote so much time to a sport<br />\nwhich isn't even varsity,\" said<br />\nteam treasurer Jonathan Hubbard.<br />\n\"The added prestige, confidence,<br />\nand crucial monetary support<br />\nshould encourage an even greater<br />\nnumber of rowers to return each<br />\nyear, which means a better team<br />\nand more victories on the water.\"<br />\nFaulkingham listed the accomplishments and conditions<br />\nwhich helped bring crew to varsity level. Upon the retirement of<br />\nformer coach Doug \"Tiger\"<br /><br />\nSergeant, two coaches were hired<br />\nin his place. Steve Perry, a successful rower with the Baltimore<br />\nRowing Club (BRC), will coach<br />\nthe varsity boats, while Joe Gatto, a rower and coxswain with the<br />\nBRC, will take on the novices(or<br />\nfirst-year rowers). A recent grant<br />\nfrom the Alumni Association<br />\nallowed the purchase of a new<br />\neight-man shell, in order to allow<br />\nfor expansion of the program.<br />\nAlso, a year ago the team moved<br />\ninto the city owned Waterview<br />\nPark Boathouse, which it shares<br />\nwith the BRC, Loyola, and<br />\nUniversity of Baltimore crews.<br />\nPreviously the crew was housed<br />\nin a dilapidated, abandoned<br />\nwarehouse which was \"not only<br />\nunsafe and impractical, but also<br />\ndemoralizing.\" Finally, several<br />\npieces of equipment have recently been purchased, such as a new<br />\ntrailer for transporting shells to<br />\nregattas, new motor launches,<br />\nand rowing machines, all of<br /><br />\n**************************************************<br /><br />\nwhich improve the quality of the<br />\nteam.<br />\nAccording to Faulkingham,<br />\n\"reaching varsity status allows us<br />\nto redirect our energies to training, and ultimately winning more<br />\nraces.\" Hopkins's racing season<br />\nbegins April 1, and will continue<br />\nevery weekend until May, when<br />\nthe regional championship, the<br /><br />\nDad Vail Regatta, is held. Both<br />\ncaptains expressed their goal of<br />\nbettering last year's success of<br />\nhaving two boats qualify for the<br />\nsemi-finals. Faulkingham also<br />\nstressed that recruiting is still<br />\nopen for rowers and coxswains<br />\nfor both teams; anyone interested<br />\nin joining should call him as soon<br />\nas possible at 366-3361.<br /><br />\nLILLLV VE<br />\nLi:<br />\n110111 LEV Luvu<br />\nGLV VELLICt'<br />\nELILLVE ELLLak-;.

But what if<br />\nthe Irish had lost? What if West<br />\nVirginia had won while Miami<br />\nwas crushing Nebraska in the<br />\nOrange Bowl? Who would have<br />\nwon the title then?<br />\nIndeed, Notre Dame saved the<br />\nNCAA and the pollsters from a<br />\nlot of controversy. But it<br />\nshouldn't have to be that way.<br />\nWhy must the NCAA rely on the<br />\nluck of the draw in bowl games<br />\nto determine the national champion of college football? It's<br />\nabout time that Division I football<br />\nadopted a playoff system to<br />\nmine the national champion.<br />\nThis idea shouldn't seem so<br />\nstrange. After all, every other<br />\nDivision in NCAA football uses<br />\na playoff system. Coaching giants<br />\nsuch as Joe Paterno and Vince<br />\nDooley have supported a post-<br /><br />\nseason tournament for years. The<br />\nNCAA has got to take the power<br />\naway form the polls and make<br />\nteams prove they're number one<br />\nby winning the championship on<br />\nthe field.<br />\nWhen you think about it, it<br />\nwouldn't be very difficult to arrange a post-season playoff.<br />\nMerely take the top six teams in<br />\nthe polls at the end of the season,<br />\ngive the top two teams a first<br />\nround bye, and have three play<br />\nsix and four play five. The winner of three vs. six would play<br />\nnumber two in the semifinals<br />\nwhile the winner of four vs. five<br />\nwould play the top ranked team.<br />\nThe winners of these two games<br />\nwould then square off for the national title. It's simple. No vote,<br />\nno controversy, and a true national champion.<br />\nOf course, there will still be<br />\nsome controversy over who gets<br />\nranked where, especially when it<br />\ncomes to the final playoff spot.<br />\nThis is where the NCAA steps in.<br />\nIf the polls don't agree on the top\u2022<br /><br />\nsix teams or if there is a split over<br />\nwho gets the sixth spot, the NCA<br />\nwill intervene to select the six<br />\nteams and their seeds. It's better<br />\nto have the NCAA make those<br />\nvital decisions anyway, so that<br />\nbiased sports writers and coaches<br />\nare kept out of the picture.<br />\nAnother important question<br />\narises: will the bowl system be<br />\nhurt by all this? The answer is an<br />\nemphatic no. The playoff system<br />\nwould basically rely on five key<br />\ngames, which can be divided<br />\namong the Rose, Fiesta, Cotton,<br />\nSugar, and Orange Bowls. Each<br />\nof these five bowls will take turns<br />\ngetting the national championship<br />\ngame. The excitement of a sudden death playoff will draw larger<br />\ncrowds, more media, and more<br />\nincome than the present system.<br />\nAs for the lower bowls (the<br />\nCitrus, Gator, Holiday, etc.),<br />\nthey can still exist by inviting the<br />\nteams which don't make the<br />\nplayoffs. Let's face it, the teams<br />\nthat these bowls invite now are<br />\nnot national championship con-<br /><br />\nPAT'S PICKS<br />\nMy final record was 92-79-2, a<br />\nwinnning percentage of 0.538. I<br />\nguess that means you could have<br />\nwon some money if you bet with me,<br />\nunless you put extra money on my<br />\nSuper Bowl and National Championship picks, in which case you lost<br />\nyour shirt.<br />\nBut just because the football<br />\nseason has ended, don't think that<br />\nyou've seen the last of PAT'S PICKS.<br />\nI will thrill you by picking the NCAA<br />\nhoops tourney, the NBA and NHL<br />\nplayoffs, and whatever else I think of.<br />\ntenders anyway. The lower bowls<br />\nwill have just as much<br />\nsignificance as they do today.<br />\nOne problem with the playoff<br />\nsystem is that it adds as many as<br />\nthree games to a schedule which<br />\nis already difficult both physically<br /><br />\nKI/s8NASE /11/581ASE Kt/scar'<br />\nYT<br />\nIF IT'S HOT ON THE CHARTS IT'S ON SALE AT<br /><br />\nBIA<br />\nNews<br /><br />\nSQUARECIRCLE<br />\nSALE THRU 1/31/1<br />\n7<br />\nAz44<br /><br />\nzk- qr<br /><br />\nARTIST<br />\nTITLE<br /><br />\n(d<br /><br />\n1 all<br /><br />\n2 10<br />\n3 7<br />\n,<br />\n4 12<br />\n5 14<br />\n6 10<br />\n7<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\n7<br />\n,<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n7<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n10 7<br /><br />\nJULIAN COPE<br />\nMY NATION UNDERGROUND'<br />\nR.E.M.<br />\nGREEN<br />\nTHE WATERBOYS<br />\nFISHERMAN'S BLUES<br />\nU2<br />\nRATTLE &amp; HUM<br />\nCAMOUFLAGE<br />\nVOICES AND IMAGES<br />\nTHE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS<br />\nLOVE JUNK<br />\nNEW ORDER<br />\nTECHNIQUE<br />\nMARC ALMOND<br />\nTHE STARS WE ARE<br />\nCOWBOY JUNKIES<br />\nTHE TRINITY SESSION<br />\nA HOUSE<br />\n\u2022N \u2022 RBI FAT MERRY\u2014 \u2022 R\u2022UND<br /><br />\nrt<br /><br />\nOA4:: -<br /><br />\ntr g<br />\nC, \u2022/<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\n44,<br /><br />\n0<br />\nto 4q<br /><br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n6.9910.99<br />\n6.99 10.99<br /><br />\n10.9912.99<br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n6.9910.99<br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n6.99 10.99<br />\n,<br />\n6.9910.99<br />\n6.9910.99<br /><br />\nLANE<br /><br />\nSr<br />\nE4C<br />\nBALTIMORE,hSPRING) (l889-3855<br />\nCIRCLE<br /><br />\nand academically.
