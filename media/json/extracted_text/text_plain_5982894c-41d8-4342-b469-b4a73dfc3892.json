The Symposium chairpersons believe that the lack<br />\nof spirit at the present time is<br />\nalso temporary. \"There are all<br />\nthese problems we have right<br />\nnow, economic, international<br />\netc.,\" says Biegel, \"but in the<br />\nend, we can overcome them.\"<br />\nMilsteen.

(The SAC<br />\nassigns to each organization<br />\nwithin its jurisdiction a class<br />\nstatus. Class A organizations can<br />\nuse the University name and<br />\nfacilities and receive annual<br />\nfinancial allotments; class B<br />\ngroups may use the University<br />\n<br />\nname and facilities and may<br />\npetition the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard for funds; class C groups<br />\nare the classes and other Council<br />\ngroups; class D groups are<br />\npublications; class E groups are<br />\nthose which, like new organization, are on probation.

Several<br />\nother Council members and<br />\nspectators contended that this<br />\nwas inappropriate because issues<br />\noften reach the Council after<br />\nconsideration by the SAC. After<br />\nthe longest discussion of the<br />\nevening, the Student Council<br />\ndecided that the vice-president<br />\nand the treasurer of each class<br />\nshall have voting membership in<br />\nthe SAC. \"The vice-president<br />\nwill represent the SAC to the<br />\nclass the same way that the<br />\npresident represents the Council<br />\nto the class,\" explained Junior<br />\nClass President Trip Gulick.<br />\n<br />\nAnother point of contention was the one year of experience required of non-Council<br />\ncommittee chairpersons.

On this go-round, I'd<br />\nlike to review the policies and<br />\noperations of several revered (at<br />\nleast until this year) campus<br />\norganizations and comment on<br />\nthe same. What I am speaking of<br />\nis the campus Film Series<br />\ngroups, namely. Weekend Wonderflix, the Student Council<br />\nFilm Series, and the Senior Class<br />\nFilm Series.<br />\nWeekend Wonderflix may<br />\ngo down as the most oppressed<br />\norganization on campus; ever<br />\nsince Spring Break of 1980,<br />\nWWF has been blackballed from<br />\nthe Chem.

What a<br />\nmistake. You figure, after over a<br />\nhundred years in this school, our<br />\nstudent government would make<br />\nthe right decision, but no, they<br />\nhad to have it all to themselves.<br />\nSo what do they do? They go<br />\nout and book ridiculous films<br />\nlike \"JAWS\",<br />\n\"The Black<br />\nStallion\", and \"The Three Musketeers\", and then proceed to<br />\nhave troubles with: the sound,<br />\nthe halls, the crowds, the projectionists... the list goes on and<br />\non.

If the reason was editorial<br />\nin nature, then the cartoon<br />\nshould have appeared in the<br />\neditorial section. If the reason<br />\nfor publishing the cartoon was<br />\nto flavor the otherwise tasteless<br />\npages of the News-Letter with<br />\nhumor, then I fail to see the<br />\ncomical point made.

Men or wymen are<br />\nhomosexual if they desire phy-<br />\n<br />\nsical relationships with members<br />\nof the same sex. They are<br />\nheterosexual if they prefer relationships with members of the<br />\ncomplementary sex. Some people are exclusively homosexual<br />\nor heterosexual; others are not<br />\nand are considered to be bisexual. An argument can be made<br />\nthat most people are bisexual.<br />\n\"<br />\nAs you should have noticed<br />\nby now, homosexual, heterosexual, and bisexual are adjectives.<br />\nSince many people are, at least<br />\npotentially, bisexual, it is incorrect to use homosexual and<br />\nheterosexual as nouns. Yes, I<br />\nknow they are commonly used<br />\nas such, but that does not<br />\nmake it correct.<br />\nI noticed,<br />\nhowever, that you did not<br />\nconsider this to be a corruption<br />\nof the language.<br />\nGay is not a sexual preference; it is a lifestyle. The<br />\nadoption of the word Gay to<br />\ndescribe men and wymen with a<br />\nhomosexual preference was not<br />\nmade to find a short, nonderogatory word for a sexual<br />\npreference, but to describe a<br />\nway of life that is more than a<br />\ngame of musical beds. Being<br />\nGay is a political statement that<br />\nI do, or at least am trying<br />\nto, accept my homosexuality<br />\nand that I am part of a community of people like myself.<br />\nThere are many homosexual<br />\nmen and wymen who are not<br />\nGay.<br />\nThere are also Gay men and<br />\nwymen who are not homosexual. The Gay community also<br />\nencompasses transsexuals who<br />\nhave similar problems but from a<br />\ndifferent perspective. Believing<br />\nthat Gay is simply a short,<br />\nnon-derogatory work to describe<br />\na sexual preference is a mistake<br />\nbased on fuzzy ideas about a<br />\n<br />\ncommunity that most outsiders<br />\nchoose to ignore.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Gay Caucus, despite its<br />\nmissing campus notes, does exist<br />\nand continues to meet on<br />\nWednesday nights in Levering<br />\nHall's conference Room A. The<br />\nCaucus' purpose is to try to<br />\ncorrect the fuzzy ideas Hopkins<br />\nstudents have about Gay men<br />\nand wymen and to provide a<br />\nplace for Gay men and wymen<br />\nto meet and gain support from<br />\neach other.<br />\nFinally, I am tired of the<br />\nargument against the use of the<br />\nword Gay being made by selfappointed language experts on<br />\ntheir own ideas of what is<br />\nproper. In my equally valid<br />\nopinion, to party is too much of<br />\na grammatical mess to even<br />\nconsider it seriously; rip-off<br />\nrefers to more than theft; and<br />\nthe criteria on which someone is<br />\njudged a turkey allows that word<br />\nto challenge decadent for the<br />\nvaguest insult of this century.<br />\nNor does relationship mean<br />\nromance, except in your context. I have relationships with<br />\nseveral people; I. am involved<br />\nin only one romance.<br />\nLanguage is not an exact<br />\nscience. It is not meant to be.<br />\nNor is it a stagnant pool(anyone<br />\nremember if the correct definition of drapes is a fancy word<br />\nfor curtains or the third person<br />\nsingular of `to drape'). Words<br />\nand society change. Inconvenient expressions (prioritize?) die<br />\nout. Usage determines survival.<br />\nSo, the next time I need the<br />\nword straight.

The Delaware<br />\nState Police, who suspected the<br />\nsurvivor, Jonathan Katz, of<br />\nlying, have been trying to<br />\ncorroborate his stories.

However,<br />\nafter gathering information from<br />\na third interview with Katz a<br />\nweek ago Monday and from the<br />\nwritten statements of two witnesses who were driving behind<br />\nthe pickup, Beck now thinks the<br />\nfacts of the incident have been<br />\nestablished: Wasserman panicked<br />\nafter after one person in the cab<br />\nthreatened him and asked him<br />\nfor money and then both<br />\nWasserman and Katz jumped<br />\nfrom the truck.

The result was \"punk\" which<br />\nbecame \"new wave\" which became a formula or label,<br />\nnothing genuine. Now bands are realizing that the<br />\nquintessential attitude behind punk can be evoked in<br />\ncomplex electronic music or atonal free jazz just as well<br />\nas in three-chord rock.<br />\nThrobbing Gristle is one of the more deliberately<br />\nbizarre new groups. Since 1978, they have released four<br />\nalbums on their own label, Industrial Records. Their<br />\nfirst album contains excerpts from live performances and<br />\na side-long soundtrack for an experimental film, After<br />\nCease to Exist. The music depends primarily on electronics and voice; it is noisy, raw, and abrasive. The<br />\nrecording quality is sometimes questionable, but this<br />\nadds to the overall effect of songs like \"Maggot Death\"<br />\nand \"Slug Bait\": demented voices reading passages from<br />\nnews articles about mutilation murders over waves of<br />\nscreeching feedback and mechanicla drone. The group<br />\nhas often stated that their music was originally inspired<br />\nby sounds they heard in the industrial area where they<br />\nlive.<br />\nTheir second album, D.O.A., is more polished<br />\nand musically ambitious. Genesis P. Orridge perfects his<br />\nsoft-spoken vocal style, and the synthesizers sound<br />\npositively menacing. In their two latest albums,20 Jazz<br />\nFunk Greats and Heathen Earth, Throbbing Gristle<br />\ncontinues to deal with favorite themes of fetishism, mass<br />\nproduction, pornography, and death.<br />\n<br />\npulsating electronics. Cabaret Voltaire's first E.P.<br />\ncontains \"Do the Mussolini (Headkick)\u201d and a Velvet<br />\nUnderground cover. Their first album Mix-Up is somewhere between robotic anarchy and sonic dada; their<br />\nlatest material has been getting even more experimental.<br />\nThe Raincoats are as rebellious as Cabaret<br />\nVoltaire, but their approach is completely different.<br />\nThefe are no synthesizers. Four women play guitar,<br />\nbass, drums, and violin. Their album is a festival of<br />\ndiscord and repressed anger. It is filled with arbitrary<br />\nstops and starts, fragments of aching melody, and a<br />\nsingular sense of persuasion. Often the sons change<br />\ndirection halfway through and build to a power (female?)climax. The music is not intended to be feminist;<br />\ninstead a certain feminine wisdom pervades every song.<br />\nGetting rid of the albatross, Sowing seeds of<br />\ndiscontent. You are unbearable...<br />\n- John Lydon<br />\n<br />\nToday Johnny Rotten goes by his real name,<br />\nJohn Lydon. He sings with Public Image Ltd, probably<br />\nthe best-known British post-punk group. PIL provokes<br />\nas much controversy among rock critics as the Sex<br />\nPistols did during their heyday. Even without Lydon's<br />\ndistinctive vocal snarl and pointed lyrics PIL would be<br />\nunique. Their music has no real precedents in rock.<br />\nBass player Joh Wobble has a fluid, unpredictable<br />\nstyle that seems to thrive on random variation. His bass<br />\naffects the music in the same way a hand-held camera<br />\naffects a film. Keith Levine applies repetitive guitar<br />\npatterns over the bass and drums. Everything comes<br />\ntogether in a flexible song structure; then the musicians<br />\ntest this structure, stretching it to the breaking point.<br />\nWobble disrupts the rhythm, Levine emphasizes the<br />\nmost savage dissonances and irregularities - nevertheless,<br />\nit holds together quite well.<br />\nThe Gang of Four is another group which uses<br />\nconventional rock structures as a starting point for more<br />\nchallenging excursions. The interplay of two guitars<br />\ncreates the basic texture of dissonance and tension. The<br />\nguitars jump between jagged atonality and familiar<br />\npower chords, while the rhythm section stays strictly<br />\ndisciplined. Many songs have gaps where the band sees<br />\nhow little they can get away with playing. Next to the<br />\nGang of Four, The Clash is a Las Vegas lounge act.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAll blips, clicks, and unseemly noises were<br />\ngenerated by refrigerators and other domestic appliances<br />\nand are intrinsic to the music.<br />\n<br />\nThis statement appears on The Bridge, an album<br />\nby Thomas Leer and Robert Rental. Leer and Rental<br />\nuse electronic rhythm generators, systhesizers, and<br />\nguitar to produce concise pop songs and expansive<br />\nexperimental pieces. Their intentional primitivism and<br />\nacceptance of both musical and unmusical sounds are<br />\ntypical of post-punk artists. Leer and Rental eschew<br />\nelaborate production, yet the music they create with<br />\nfour-frack tape equipment is richer and more detailed<br />\nhan a lot of extravagantly produced material by well\u201eknown groups.<br />\nCabaret Voltaire, like Throbbing Gristle, uses<br />\nsynthesizers to create harsh sound collages held together by machine rythyms. Their songs sometimes<br />\nresemble explorations of the<br />\nshort-wave band on a<br />\nradio, with filtered,<br />\ndenatured voices<br />\ncutting in and<br />\nout of gurgling,<br />\n<br />\nSpeak chain lightning Words of blue glass...

Their three<br />\nalbums each contain large posters and assorted collages<br />\nmade from newspaper clippings and photographs deal<br />\nmenting war, famine, executions, and tribal rites. This<br />\nvisual material is fairly analogous to the Pop G.-oup's<br />\n\u2022 music, which is a montage of violent, fragmented sound<br />\noverlaid with stiff, cold, broken-up funk. Booming<br />\ndrums and unidentifiable noises usually drown out<br />\nthe declamatory vocals, and unorthodox mixing makes it<br />\nimpossible to tell exactly what's going on. Hard funk<br />\nrhythms crop up once in awhile, competing with the<br />\nvocals for attention.

In a song<br />\nby the Swell Maps, one might hear a collection of toy<br />\ninstruments pitted against heavy-metal guitar.

According to the<br />\nbrochures, Harborplace is \"a sparkling<br />\ngathering place. A colorful and festive<br />\nmarket.\" I prefer to think of it as a<br />\nnever-ending block party, the city's way<br />\nof celebrating itself. Though Harborplace<br />\nis stuffed to bursting with the same kind<br />\nof foreign fast food, ritzy restaurants, and<br />\ndesigner boutiques that characterize<br />\nmany other \"urban renaissance\" malls,<br />\nthe unique blend of city and suburbs,<br />\nyoung and old, couples, families, singles<br />\nand tourists makes this glass palace truly<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nSituated on the corner of Light<br />\n(St. Paul) and Pratt Streets, Harborplace<br />\nis ideal for people-watching and was<br />\nprobably built with that in mind. The<br />\ncomplex Is divided into two similar glass<br />\nstructures with green rooves: the Light<br />\nStreet Pavilion which contains mostly<br />\nrestaurants, fast-food places, and relatively inexpensive specialty stores; and the<br />\nPratt Street Pavilion which houses the<br />\nmore formal restaurant% and the more<br />\nexpensive clothing and art stores.<br />\nThe Light Street Pavilion has three<br />\nrestaurants with outdoor seating that<br />\nsimulate a European cafe atmosphere The Soup Kitchen, Phillip's Harborplace,<br />\nand Jean-Claude's Cafe. There's also a<br />\n<br />\nbar upstairs called City Lights and a<br />\nspinoff of Washington's American Cafe<br />\nwhich is still being assembled. Of the<br />\nthree downstairs places, I've only been tc<br />\nThe Soup Kitchen, which has a wide<br />\nvariety of soups, salads and desserts foi<br />\nabout $6 or $7 a meal, but Phillip's, Alk<br />\na spinoff of the Ocean City restaurant, is \" '<br />\nsupposed to offer excellent seafood.<br />\n(The lines for tables are always long, if<br />\nWhat I like<br />\nthat's any indication).<br />\nmost about the place, though, is the<br />\npeople singing old songs around the z,<br />\nsemi-outdoor piano, unabashedly sloshed4<br />\nand having a good time.<br />\nEven the upstairs of the Light<br />\nStreet building, which houses the indoor, 1_<br />\n11<br />\nFood Hall (international fast food) and -AN-411<br />\nthe Sam Smith Market (inexpensive izing on the home-made cookie fad, is<br />\nboutiques), provides outdoor balconies only fair, its baked goods being less than<br />\nfrom which to watch the people go by. chewy and rather bland. The Shuckers<br />\nThe fast food tends to run about a dollar Raw Bar has good oysters, but the<br />\nor so more than you'd pay for fast service is quicker and the prices lower at<br />\nfood at Burger King or McDonald's. Of the Phillip's raw bar downstairs. The<br />\nthe fast food stands, Dianna's Carribean Trish Express, a carry-out featuring<br />\nCooking (featuring curried goat and Chinese, Sezchuan and Hainan food, is<br />\nchicken) is among the most expensive comparable to Chinese fast food in other<br />\n(about $5 a meal), but also one of the cities, but those expecting quality and<br />\nbest. The Mexican Fiesta offers fairly authenticity for three or four dollars a<br />\nstandard tacos, though its chicken burri- platter won't find it here.<br />\ntos are heavy and monotonous. The<br />\nIn general, the Food Hall is<br />\nItalian Villa-Tavola Calda serves spicy<br />\nsubs generously doused with hot peppers colorful, but the food mediocre. This is<br />\nin the best tradition of Philadelphia counterbalanced by the surrounding<br />\nhoagies. The Cookie Connection, capital. boutique booths in Sam Smith's Market<br />\nwhich offer everything from balloons,<br />\nbanks, and crab ornaments to comic<br />\nbooks, pens, and Latin American handicrafts. Of special interest are the kite<br />\nstore, offering both the beautiful and the<br />\npractical; the hat store, selling baseball<br />\ncaps with horns, wings, antlers and even<br />\none topped by a unicorn whose wings<br />\nflap when you pull the string; and Harborplace News, a gem of a newsstand<br />\noffering a wide selection of American<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\nisifv\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\npapers, magazines, best sellers and many<br />\nforeign publications not available in the<br />\nHopkins library.<br />\nIn contrast with the bright,<br />\nbustling tone of the Light Street Pavilion,<br />\nthe Pratt Street Pavilion is a little more<br />\nsubdued, people examing the higher.<br />\npriced items with awe, talking about<br />\nthem with their neighbors. Harborplace<br />\nis not the locale for bargain-hunting; it's<br />\nbetter for window-shopping, gift-buying,<br />\nThe<br />\nand occasional self-indulgence.<br />\nclothes stores include The Limited, a<br />\nwomen's specialty store; The Narragansett, a preppy sportswear outfit; Jones<br />\nand Jones, which offers beautiful Chinese<br />\nsilk clothes as well as all manner of exotic<br />\nearrings and combs; and Laura Ashley<br />\n(not yet built), for those of us who want<br />\nto live out our fantasies of the American<br />\nRevolution and Gone with the Wind.<br />\nNotable among the gift-oriented<br />\nstores are the Calico Cat, which sells<br />\nexquisite crafts; the China Closet, which<br />\noffers an array of every shape, size,<br />\ncolor and material of houseware; A Little<br />\ncont. on p. 12<br />\n<br />\nChevy Chase, Ted Knight, and Rodney Dangerfield make a wacky comedy team<br />\n<br />\nSnobs vs. Slobs<br />\nOn The Links<br />\nBY JUNIUS LOGAN<br />\nI have never mastered golf,<br />\nprobably because I lack the skill and/or<br />\npatience to con an egg-sized ball across<br />\nacres of rolling lawn and into a hole no<br />\nbigger than a shot glass. Nevertheless, I<br />\nenjoyed Caddyshack and if you haven't<br />\nseen it, I urge you to do so, before it slips<br />\ninto commercial limbo of T.V. sales and<br />\ndistribution.<br />\nThe action - rather the misadventures - take place at the Bushwood<br />\nCountry Club, a snob preserve run by the<br />\nstiff Judge Sm ails (Ted Knight). He<br />\nand the rest of Bushwood's pompous elite<br />\nmust contend with a plethora of kooks:<br />\nmainly Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), Al Czervick (Rodney Dangerfield), and a deranged assistant greenskeeper named Carl (Bill<br />\nMurray). In playing off Ted Knight,<br />\nthese three brilliantly realize the film's<br />\ncomic potential, which is firmly based in<br />\nthe old Marx Brothers formula - propriety<br />\ntakes a beating.<br />\nCaddyshack owes much of its<br />\nsuccess to excellent casting, as each actor<br />\nplays a part tailored to his particular<br />\nexpertise in timing, slapstick and caricature. Chase moves easily through the<br />\ndizzy maunderings of a Zen-indocrinated<br />\n<br />\nplayboy.<br />\nDangerfield is mercilessly<br />\nfunny as an ostentatious millionaire<br />\ndeveloper, complete with a bright red<br />\nRolls Royce, a gadget-ridden golf bag to<br />\nshame James Bond, and a propensity for<br />\ntossing money like rice at a wedding. Bill<br />\nMurray's cartoon-like guerilla war against<br />\nan annoying gopher benefits so much<br />\nfrom his believeability that the audience<br />\nis quickly drawn into this hilarious Tomand-Jerry schtik.<br />\nRemarkably, there is a purpose<br />\nbeneath this insanity, as these three<br />\nbedevil Bushwood's upper-crustiness, not<br />\nparticularly out of malice, but their<br />\ninability to fit in. As expressed by the<br />\nJudge, Caddyshack's theme is: \"Some<br />\npeople just don't belong.\"<br />\nThe writers see no evil in this, and<br />\nchampion the virtues of individuality<br />\nthrough Danny Newnen, a young caddy<br />\nambivalent towards an impending college<br />\neducation and a future in his father's<br />\nlumber yard. Eventually, conflict between social pressures and his own desires<br />\nresult in an identity crisis and the formation of a love triangle which includes his<br />\ngirlfriend and Smails' flirtatious bombshell niece. This plot line serves to unify<br />\nthe seemingly disjointed antics of Chase,<br />\nDangerfield and Murray. Fortunately,<br />\n<br />\nthe writers balanced the script so that<br />\nDanny's story does not strike the audience as a disturbing note of sentimentality in an otherwise light film.<br />\nIf Caddyshack suffers at all, it is<br />\nfrom the cardboard nature of its female<br />\ncharacters. Though Smails' niece can<br />\nbe excused, Danny's girlfriend could use<br />\nmore dimension, or at least, what few<br />\ncomplexities she does possess could be<br />\nreworked into a combination which<br />\nmakes sense. Her reaction to Danny's<br />\ninfidelity is disappointingly mild and her<br />\nbehavior during a later kink in their<br />\nromance prompts the audience to scratch<br />\nits heads.<br />\nA Joan Rivers, Mary Tyler Moore,<br />\nCarol Burnett, or some other comedienne<br />\nwith enough presence to complement<br />\nDangerfield, Chase or Murray would be a<br />\nwelcome addition to the film. More and<br />\nmore, women are taking up golf, and the<br />\nwriters seem aware of this, as women<br />\ngolfers appear as extras. Sadly, the comic<br />\npotential of a female gonzo golfer is<br />\nignored - unfortunate as female viewers<br />\nare left to identify with Smelling's wild<br />\nniece or Danny's domesticated girlfriend.<br />\nThis aside, eighteen holes\" of<br />\nCaddyshack, with its charmingly crazed<br />\ncharacters, effective balance of dialogue<br />\n<br />\nto action, and supportive score (Johnny<br />\nMandel and Kenny Loggins) provides<br />\nsolid entertainment and simple diversion<br />\nfrom the worries of low GPA's, troublesome work-study jobs and romantic<br />\nproblems.<br />\nIsn't that the traditional purpose<br />\nof a summer movie?<br />\nCaddyshack is rated R, because of<br />\nnudity and minor vulgarity.<br />\n<br />\niv;jtactAr.741.1<br />\n<br />\nBill Murray on the warpath<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12 / SEPTEMBER 19, 1980<br />\n<br />\nCrisp And Danceable<br />\n<br />\nNew Wave with Island Beat<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br />\n<br />\nThis is particularly true on \"Mirror in the<br />\nBathroom\", the dark opening cut. The<br />\ntapestry of sources is rounded out by the<br />\nunusual (for reggae) trebly guitar and<br />\norgan lines of \"Best Friend\"; the combination sounds like the early Byrds, only<br />\nmore sardonic.<br />\nEven the weak spots are noble<br />\nefforts. The cover of Smokey Robinson's<br />\n\"Tears of a Clown\" is as vacuous as the<br />\noriginal is emotive, but its jumping<br />\narrangement carries it through as, seemingly, just a minor song. \"Can't Get Used<br />\nto Losing You\", a sappy, quasi-slowdance<br />\n<br />\nYes: no album recorded this year<br />\nmatches the English Beat's I Just Can't<br />\nStop It. Urgent, frenetically driven, and<br />\nbest of all, eminently danceable, this<br />\nhighly agreeable mix of New Wave, ska,<br />\nand reggae music yields one of the most<br />\nlistenable records since Armed Forces.<br />\nIts sources have mellowed - Elvis in quiet<br />\nexile after attempting to present \"20 hits<br />\n20\", ska trendies fading into new fashions, and reggae musicians giving up in<br />\ntheir hopeless struggle for a huge, Stoneslike following - but the spirit of this<br />\nalbum remains as crisp as the glory days<br />\nof its predecessors.<br />\nSaxa, the nameless Jamaican tenor<br />\nplayer, steers the group on its rollicking<br />\npath. His sax chops are, depending on<br />\nthe song, angry, buoyant, carousing,<br />\nDionysian. It is as if Chuck Berry met<br />\nthe sax player from all those forties<br />\nmovies set in the Carribean. He has a<br />\ntendency to float melodies in and out of<br />\nthe songs' main riffs instead of wailing<br />\nlike hell for one solo; the result, largely<br />\ndue to his strength, is a balance and a<br />\ntightness about all the songs.<br />\nBehind the rough-hewn polish of<br />\nSaxa's work are five kids, presumably English, three white and two black.<br />\nSomeone in the group comes from<br />\nBraxton (London's black ghetto) or<br />\nJamaica, as is revealed by the fine vocals<br />\non \"Rough Rider\", the Prince Buster ska<br />\nclassic (a seemingly obligatory phrase<br />\nfor critics who have long ignored this ole<br />\nmaster). On other cuts, however, the<br />\ncombination of power chording and<br />\nalienation-theme vocals suggests Joe Jackson or The Police as reference points.<br />\n<br />\ntune, is saved by excellent vocals and<br />\nSaxa's first-rate sax chart: you can<br />\nalmost picture blue spotlights and soulful<br />\ngirls with elaborate hairdos.<br />\nPerhaps, with this year's lot of<br />\nrotten records, I Just Can't Stop It<br />\nsits in an unnaturally high place; it seems<br />\nunlikely that any group could produce a<br />\nsecond album as frenzied and well-packed<br />\nas this. A concert appearance this Saturday at Painter's Mill will partly answer the<br />\nquestion. How much more can be mined<br />\nfrom a New Wave-Jamaica blend is up to<br />\nThe English Beat.<br />\n<br />\nRomance with the English Beat<br />\n<br />\nOn The Waterfront<br />\ncont. from p. 11<br />\nSomething, dollhouse furniture; The<br />\nOrnament House, which blares Christmas<br />\ntunes and tempts you with edible-looking<br />\nbread-dough trinkets; What's Your Game,<br />\na toy and game store; and my favorite,<br />\nEmbraceable Zoo, one of whose llamas<br />\nnow nestles securely in the menagerie<br />\non my bed.<br />\nThe two major Pratt Street<br />\nrestaurants are Pronto Ristorante and the<br />\nBlack Pearl. Pronto, which features<br />\nnorthern Italian cuisine, offers a spectacular view of the Inner Harbor sunset as<br />\nthe sky turns darker and darker until all<br />\nthat remains is the string of lights along<br />\ni ,the Light Street Pavilion and the lights of<br />\nthe boats docked alongside it. Its food,<br />\n'though spicy and tasty, is heavy and<br />\nexpensive. The Black Pearl's seafood<br />\ncuisine is mediocre as well though more<br />\nr reasonably priced.

SC President Michael<br />\nSteele, the author of the constitution, which will be placed<br />\non the ballot as Proposal C,<br />\nexpressed an intention to seek<br />\nwithdrawal of Council support<br />\nfor the once-defeated Proposal<br />\nA.<br />\nSeveral provisions of the<br />\nconstitution were particularly<br />\ncontroversial. Sections dealing<br />\nwith the Student Activities<br />\nCommission (SAC) and the<br />\nregular standing committees,<br />\nStudent Legal Rights, Housing<br />\nand Community Relations, Financial Aid, Student Services and<br />\nEducation, underwent special<br />\nscrutiny.<br />\nConcerning the SAC, Council debated the status of the<br />\nfreshman, sophomore, junior,<br />\nand senior classes. (The SAC<br />\nassigns to each organization<br />\nwithin its jurisdiction a class<br />\nstatus. Class A organizations can<br />\nuse the University name and<br />\nfacilities and receive annual<br />\nfinancial allotments; class B<br />\ngroups may use the University<br /><br />\nname and facilities and may<br />\npetition the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard for funds; class C groups<br />\nare the classes and other Council<br />\ngroups; class D groups are<br />\npublications; class E groups are<br />\nthose which, like new organization, are on probation.

Some Council members objected to this as<br />\nan excessive concentration of<br />\npower, noting that class presidents would then vote on both<br />\nthe SAC and Council. Several<br />\nother Council members and<br />\nspectators contended that this<br />\nwas inappropriate because issues<br />\noften reach the Council after<br />\nconsideration by the SAC. After<br />\nthe longest discussion of the<br />\nevening, the Student Council<br />\ndecided that the vice-president<br />\nand the treasurer of each class<br />\nshall have voting membership in<br />\nthe SAC. \"The vice-president<br />\nwill represent the SAC to the<br />\nclass the same way that the<br />\npresident represents the Council<br />\nto the class,\" explained Junior<br />\nClass President Trip Gulick.<br /><br />\nAnother point of contention was the one year of experience required of non-Council<br />\ncommittee chairpersons.

Men or wymen are<br />\nhomosexual if they desire phy-<br /><br />\nsical relationships with members<br />\nof the same sex. They are<br />\nheterosexual if they prefer relationships with members of the<br />\ncomplementary sex. Some people are exclusively homosexual<br />\nor heterosexual; others are not<br />\nand are considered to be bisexual. An argument can be made<br />\nthat most people are bisexual.<br />\n\"<br />\nAs you should have noticed<br />\nby now, homosexual, heterosexual, and bisexual are adjectives.<br />\nSince many people are, at least<br />\npotentially, bisexual, it is incorrect to use homosexual and<br />\nheterosexual as nouns. Yes, I<br />\nknow they are commonly used<br />\nas such, but that does not<br />\nmake it correct.<br />\nI noticed,<br />\nhowever, that you did not<br />\nconsider this to be a corruption<br />\nof the language.<br />\nGay is not a sexual preference; it is a lifestyle. The<br />\nadoption of the word Gay to<br />\ndescribe men and wymen with a<br />\nhomosexual preference was not<br />\nmade to find a short, nonderogatory word for a sexual<br />\npreference, but to describe a<br />\nway of life that is more than a<br />\ngame of musical beds. Being<br />\nGay is a political statement that<br />\nI do, or at least am trying<br />\nto, accept my homosexuality<br />\nand that I am part of a community of people like myself.<br />\nThere are many homosexual<br />\nmen and wymen who are not<br />\nGay.<br />\nThere are also Gay men and<br />\nwymen who are not homosexual. The Gay community also<br />\nencompasses transsexuals who<br />\nhave similar problems but from a<br />\ndifferent perspective. Believing<br />\nthat Gay is simply a short,<br />\nnon-derogatory work to describe<br />\na sexual preference is a mistake<br />\nbased on fuzzy ideas about a<br /><br />\ncommunity that most outsiders<br />\nchoose to ignore.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Gay Caucus, despite its<br />\nmissing campus notes, does exist<br />\nand continues to meet on<br />\nWednesday nights in Levering<br />\nHall's conference Room A. The<br />\nCaucus' purpose is to try to<br />\ncorrect the fuzzy ideas Hopkins<br />\nstudents have about Gay men<br />\nand wymen and to provide a<br />\nplace for Gay men and wymen<br />\nto meet and gain support from<br />\neach other.<br />\nFinally, I am tired of the<br />\nargument against the use of the<br />\nword Gay being made by selfappointed language experts on<br />\ntheir own ideas of what is<br />\nproper. In my equally valid<br />\nopinion, to party is too much of<br />\na grammatical mess to even<br />\nconsider it seriously; rip-off<br />\nrefers to more than theft; and<br />\nthe criteria on which someone is<br />\njudged a turkey allows that word<br />\nto challenge decadent for the<br />\nvaguest insult of this century.<br />\nNor does relationship mean<br />\nromance, except in your context.

The result was \"punk\" which<br />\nbecame \"new wave\" which became a formula or label,<br />\nnothing genuine. Now bands are realizing that the<br />\nquintessential attitude behind punk can be evoked in<br />\ncomplex electronic music or atonal free jazz just as well<br />\nas in three-chord rock.<br />\nThrobbing Gristle is one of the more deliberately<br />\nbizarre new groups. Since 1978, they have released four<br />\nalbums on their own label, Industrial Records. Their<br />\nfirst album contains excerpts from live performances and<br />\na side-long soundtrack for an experimental film, After<br />\nCease to Exist. The music depends primarily on electronics and voice; it is noisy, raw, and abrasive. The<br />\nrecording quality is sometimes questionable, but this<br />\nadds to the overall effect of songs like \"Maggot Death\"<br />\nand \"Slug Bait\": demented voices reading passages from<br />\nnews articles about mutilation murders over waves of<br />\nscreeching feedback and mechanicla drone. The group<br />\nhas often stated that their music was originally inspired<br />\nby sounds they heard in the industrial area where they<br />\nlive.<br />\nTheir second album, D.O.A., is more polished<br />\nand musically ambitious. Genesis P. Orridge perfects his<br />\nsoft-spoken vocal style, and the synthesizers sound<br />\npositively menacing. In their two latest albums,20 Jazz<br />\nFunk Greats and Heathen Earth, Throbbing Gristle<br />\ncontinues to deal with favorite themes of fetishism, mass<br />\nproduction, pornography, and death.<br /><br />\npulsating electronics. Cabaret Voltaire's first E.P.<br />\ncontains \"Do the Mussolini (Headkick)\u201d and a Velvet<br />\nUnderground cover. Their first album Mix-Up is somewhere between robotic anarchy and sonic dada; their<br />\nlatest material has been getting even more experimental.<br />\nThe Raincoats are as rebellious as Cabaret<br />\nVoltaire, but their approach is completely different.<br />\nThefe are no synthesizers. Four women play guitar,<br />\nbass, drums, and violin. Their album is a festival of<br />\ndiscord and repressed anger. It is filled with arbitrary<br />\nstops and starts, fragments of aching melody, and a<br />\nsingular sense of persuasion. Often the sons change<br />\ndirection halfway through and build to a power (female?)climax. The music is not intended to be feminist;<br />\ninstead a certain feminine wisdom pervades every song.<br />\nGetting rid of the albatross, Sowing seeds of<br />\ndiscontent. You are unbearable...<br />\n- John Lydon<br /><br />\nToday Johnny Rotten goes by his real name,<br />\nJohn Lydon. He sings with Public Image Ltd, probably<br />\nthe best-known British post-punk group. PIL provokes<br />\nas much controversy among rock critics as the Sex<br />\nPistols did during their heyday. Even without Lydon's<br />\ndistinctive vocal snarl and pointed lyrics PIL would be<br />\nunique. Their music has no real precedents in rock.<br />\nBass player Joh Wobble has a fluid, unpredictable<br />\nstyle that seems to thrive on random variation. His bass<br />\naffects the music in the same way a hand-held camera<br />\naffects a film. Keith Levine applies repetitive guitar<br />\npatterns over the bass and drums. Everything comes<br />\ntogether in a flexible song structure; then the musicians<br />\ntest this structure, stretching it to the breaking point.<br />\nWobble disrupts the rhythm, Levine emphasizes the<br />\nmost savage dissonances and irregularities - nevertheless,<br />\nit holds together quite well.<br />\nThe Gang of Four is another group which uses<br />\nconventional rock structures as a starting point for more<br />\nchallenging excursions. The interplay of two guitars<br />\ncreates the basic texture of dissonance and tension. The<br />\nguitars jump between jagged atonality and familiar<br />\npower chords, while the rhythm section stays strictly<br />\ndisciplined. Many songs have gaps where the band sees<br />\nhow little they can get away with playing. Next to the<br />\nGang of Four, The Clash is a Las Vegas lounge act.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nAll blips, clicks, and unseemly noises were<br />\ngenerated by refrigerators and other domestic appliances<br />\nand are intrinsic to the music.<br /><br />\nThis statement appears on The Bridge, an album<br />\nby Thomas Leer and Robert Rental. Leer and Rental<br />\nuse electronic rhythm generators, systhesizers, and<br />\nguitar to produce concise pop songs and expansive<br />\nexperimental pieces. Their intentional primitivism and<br />\nacceptance of both musical and unmusical sounds are<br />\ntypical of post-punk artists.

Their three<br />\nalbums each contain large posters and assorted collages<br />\nmade from newspaper clippings and photographs deal<br />\nmenting war, famine, executions, and tribal rites. This<br />\nvisual material is fairly analogous to the Pop G.-oup's<br />\n\u2022 music, which is a montage of violent, fragmented sound<br />\noverlaid with stiff, cold, broken-up funk. Booming<br />\ndrums and unidentifiable noises usually drown out<br />\nthe declamatory vocals, and unorthodox mixing makes it<br />\nimpossible to tell exactly what's going on. Hard funk<br />\nrhythms crop up once in awhile, competing with the<br />\nvocals for attention. Actually, the texts are the least<br />\nsuccessful part of The Pop Group's work; their music<br />\nalone is disturbing enough.<br />\nThe Swell Maps and. The Young Marble Giants<br />\nare two groups that specialize in short, sparsely instrumented sketches of pop songs. They try to include an<br />\nabsolute minimum of musical detail...just enough to<br />\nbarely define .a .\"song.\" Both groups share a kindred<br />\nsense of the absurd (musically and lyrically). In a song<br />\nby the Swell Maps, one might hear a collection of toy<br />\ninstruments pitted against heavy-metal guitar. The<br />\nYoung Marble Giants' lyrics occasionally invite comparison with Russell Edson's prose poems. Both groups like<br />\nto play with the listener's expectations in subtle ways.<br />\nPost-punk groups in<br />\nEngland are beginning to attract listeners outside their<br />\ncult followings.

This is<br />\nin the best tradition of Philadelphia counterbalanced by the surrounding<br />\nhoagies. The Cookie Connection, capital. boutique booths in Sam Smith's Market<br />\nwhich offer everything from balloons,<br />\nbanks, and crab ornaments to comic<br />\nbooks, pens, and Latin American handicrafts. Of special interest are the kite<br />\nstore, offering both the beautiful and the<br />\npractical; the hat store, selling baseball<br />\ncaps with horns, wings, antlers and even<br />\none topped by a unicorn whose wings<br />\nflap when you pull the string; and Harborplace News, a gem of a newsstand<br />\noffering a wide selection of American<br /><br />\n1<br />\nisifv\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\npapers, magazines, best sellers and many<br />\nforeign publications not available in the<br />\nHopkins library.<br />\nIn contrast with the bright,<br />\nbustling tone of the Light Street Pavilion,<br />\nthe Pratt Street Pavilion is a little more<br />\nsubdued, people examing the higher.<br />\npriced items with awe, talking about<br />\nthem with their neighbors. Harborplace<br />\nis not the locale for bargain-hunting; it's<br />\nbetter for window-shopping, gift-buying,<br />\nThe<br />\nand occasional self-indulgence.<br />\nclothes stores include The Limited, a<br />\nwomen's specialty store; The Narragansett, a preppy sportswear outfit; Jones<br />\nand Jones, which offers beautiful Chinese<br />\nsilk clothes as well as all manner of exotic<br />\nearrings and combs; and Laura Ashley<br />\n(not yet built), for those of us who want<br />\nto live out our fantasies of the American<br />\nRevolution and Gone with the Wind.<br />\nNotable among the gift-oriented<br />\nstores are the Calico Cat, which sells<br />\nexquisite crafts; the China Closet, which<br />\noffers an array of every shape, size,<br />\ncolor and material of houseware; A Little<br />\ncont. on p. 12<br /><br />\nChevy Chase, Ted Knight, and Rodney Dangerfield make a wacky comedy team<br /><br />\nSnobs vs. Slobs<br />\nOn The Links<br />\nBY JUNIUS LOGAN<br />\nI have never mastered golf,<br />\nprobably because I lack the skill and/or<br />\npatience to con an egg-sized ball across<br />\nacres of rolling lawn and into a hole no<br />\nbigger than a shot glass. Nevertheless, I<br />\nenjoyed Caddyshack and if you haven't<br />\nseen it, I urge you to do so, before it slips<br />\ninto commercial limbo of T.V. sales and<br />\ndistribution.<br />\nThe action - rather the misadventures - take place at the Bushwood<br />\nCountry Club, a snob preserve run by the<br />\nstiff Judge Sm ails (Ted Knight). He<br />\nand the rest of Bushwood's pompous elite<br />\nmust contend with a plethora of kooks:<br />\nmainly Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), Al Czervick (Rodney Dangerfield), and a deranged assistant greenskeeper named Carl (Bill<br />\nMurray). In playing off Ted Knight,<br />\nthese three brilliantly realize the film's<br />\ncomic potential, which is firmly based in<br />\nthe old Marx Brothers formula - propriety<br />\ntakes a beating.<br />\nCaddyshack owes much of its<br />\nsuccess to excellent casting, as each actor<br />\nplays a part tailored to his particular<br />\nexpertise in timing, slapstick and caricature. Chase moves easily through the<br />\ndizzy maunderings of a Zen-indocrinated<br /><br />\nplayboy.<br />\nDangerfield is mercilessly<br />\nfunny as an ostentatious millionaire<br />\ndeveloper, complete with a bright red<br />\nRolls Royce, a gadget-ridden golf bag to<br />\nshame James Bond, and a propensity for<br />\ntossing money like rice at a wedding. Bill<br />\nMurray's cartoon-like guerilla war against<br />\nan annoying gopher benefits so much<br />\nfrom his believeability that the audience<br />\nis quickly drawn into this hilarious Tomand-Jerry schtik.<br />\nRemarkably, there is a purpose<br />\nbeneath this insanity, as these three<br />\nbedevil Bushwood's upper-crustiness, not<br />\nparticularly out of malice, but their<br />\ninability to fit in. As expressed by the<br />\nJudge, Caddyshack's theme is: \"Some<br />\npeople just don't belong.\"<br />\nThe writers see no evil in this, and<br />\nchampion the virtues of individuality<br />\nthrough Danny Newnen, a young caddy<br />\nambivalent towards an impending college<br />\neducation and a future in his father's<br />\nlumber yard. Eventually, conflict between social pressures and his own desires<br />\nresult in an identity crisis and the formation of a love triangle which includes his<br />\ngirlfriend and Smails' flirtatious bombshell niece. This plot line serves to unify<br />\nthe seemingly disjointed antics of Chase,<br />\nDangerfield and Murray. Fortunately,<br /><br />\nthe writers balanced the script so that<br />\nDanny's story does not strike the audience as a disturbing note of sentimentality in an otherwise light film.<br />\nIf Caddyshack suffers at all, it is<br />\nfrom the cardboard nature of its female<br />\ncharacters. Though Smails' niece can<br />\nbe excused, Danny's girlfriend could use<br />\nmore dimension, or at least, what few<br />\ncomplexities she does possess could be<br />\nreworked into a combination which<br />\nmakes sense. Her reaction to Danny's<br />\ninfidelity is disappointingly mild and her<br />\nbehavior during a later kink in their<br />\nromance prompts the audience to scratch<br />\nits heads.<br />\nA Joan Rivers, Mary Tyler Moore,<br />\nCarol Burnett, or some other comedienne<br />\nwith enough presence to complement<br />\nDangerfield, Chase or Murray would be a<br />\nwelcome addition to the film. More and<br />\nmore, women are taking up golf, and the<br />\nwriters seem aware of this, as women<br />\ngolfers appear as extras. Sadly, the comic<br />\npotential of a female gonzo golfer is<br />\nignored - unfortunate as female viewers<br />\nare left to identify with Smelling's wild<br />\nniece or Danny's domesticated girlfriend.<br />\nThis aside, eighteen holes\" of<br />\nCaddyshack, with its charmingly crazed<br />\ncharacters, effective balance of dialogue<br /><br />\nto action, and supportive score (Johnny<br />\nMandel and Kenny Loggins) provides<br />\nsolid entertainment and simple diversion<br />\nfrom the worries of low GPA's, troublesome work-study jobs and romantic<br />\nproblems.<br />\nIsn't that the traditional purpose<br />\nof a summer movie?<br />\nCaddyshack is rated R, because of<br />\nnudity and minor vulgarity.<br /><br />\niv;jtactAr.741.1<br /><br />\nBill Murray on the warpath<br /><br />\nPAGE 12 / SEPTEMBER 19, 1980<br /><br />\nCrisp And Danceable<br /><br />\nNew Wave with Island Beat<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br /><br />\nThis is particularly true on \"Mirror in the<br />\nBathroom\", the dark opening cut. The<br />\ntapestry of sources is rounded out by the<br />\nunusual (for reggae) trebly guitar and<br />\norgan lines of \"Best Friend\"; the combination sounds like the early Byrds, only<br />\nmore sardonic.<br />\nEven the weak spots are noble<br />\nefforts. The cover of Smokey Robinson's<br />\n\"Tears of a Clown\" is as vacuous as the<br />\noriginal is emotive, but its jumping<br />\narrangement carries it through as, seemingly, just a minor song. \"Can't Get Used<br />\nto Losing You\", a sappy, quasi-slowdance<br /><br />\nYes: no album recorded this year<br />\nmatches the English Beat's I Just Can't<br />\nStop It. Urgent, frenetically driven, and<br />\nbest of all, eminently danceable, this<br />\nhighly agreeable mix of New Wave, ska,<br />\nand reggae music yields one of the most<br />\nlistenable records since Armed Forces.<br />\nIts sources have mellowed - Elvis in quiet<br />\nexile after attempting to present \"20 hits<br />\n20\", ska trendies fading into new fashions, and reggae musicians giving up in<br />\ntheir hopeless struggle for a huge, Stoneslike following - but the spirit of this<br />\nalbum remains as crisp as the glory days<br />\nof its predecessors.<br />\nSaxa, the nameless Jamaican tenor<br />\nplayer, steers the group on its rollicking<br />\npath. His sax chops are, depending on<br />\nthe song, angry, buoyant, carousing,<br />\nDionysian. It is as if Chuck Berry met<br />\nthe sax player from all those forties<br />\nmovies set in the Carribean. He has a<br />\ntendency to float melodies in and out of<br />\nthe songs' main riffs instead of wailing<br />\nlike hell for one solo; the result, largely<br />\ndue to his strength, is a balance and a<br />\ntightness about all the songs.<br />\nBehind the rough-hewn polish of<br />\nSaxa's work are five kids, presumably English, three white and two black.<br />\nSomeone in the group comes from<br />\nBraxton (London's black ghetto) or<br />\nJamaica, as is revealed by the fine vocals<br />\non \"Rough Rider\", the Prince Buster ska<br />\nclassic (a seemingly obligatory phrase<br />\nfor critics who have long ignored this ole<br />\nmaster). On other cuts, however, the<br />\ncombination of power chording and<br />\nalienation-theme vocals suggests Joe Jackson or The Police as reference points.<br /><br />\ntune, is saved by excellent vocals and<br />\nSaxa's first-rate sax chart: you can<br />\nalmost picture blue spotlights and soulful<br />\ngirls with elaborate hairdos.<br />\nPerhaps, with this year's lot of<br />\nrotten records, I Just Can't Stop It<br />\nsits in an unnaturally high place; it seems<br />\nunlikely that any group could produce a<br />\nsecond album as frenzied and well-packed<br />\nas this. A concert appearance this Saturday at Painter's Mill will partly answer the<br />\nquestion. How much more can be mined<br />\nfrom a New Wave-Jamaica blend is up to<br />\nThe English Beat.<br /><br />\nRomance with the English Beat<br /><br />\nOn The Waterfront<br />\ncont. from p. 11<br />\nSomething, dollhouse furniture; The<br />\nOrnament House, which blares Christmas<br />\ntunes and tempts you with edible-looking<br />\nbread-dough trinkets; What's Your Game,<br />\na toy and game store; and my favorite,<br />\nEmbraceable Zoo, one of whose llamas<br />\nnow nestles securely in the menagerie<br />\non my bed.<br />\nThe two major Pratt Street<br />\nrestaurants are Pronto Ristorante and the<br />\nBlack Pearl.

Originally an engineering major, he has switched<br />\nto mathematical sciences.<br />\nBill keeps a low-key personality. \"He's a very quiet, very<br />\nhard-working individual,\" says<br /><br />\nPfieffer. \"He is not a 'star'<br />\npersonality. He understands its<br />\njust a game, and he drops it at<br />\nthat.\" Pfieffer believes him to be<br />\n\"embarrassed\" by publicity.<br />\nStromberg is uncertain about his future after college, but<br />\nhe says he is \"definitely going to<br />\ntry\" to make it in professional<br />\nfootball, with a job or grad<br />\nschool as alternatives. At least<br />\none of his coaches has said that<br />\nStromberg has a realistic chance<br />\nof becoming one of that rarest<br />\nof rare breeds, a Hopkins graduate in the NFL.<br />\nThe 2 PM opener against<br />\nWidener will be an awesome<br />\nassignment for Jerry Pfeifer's<br />\nfirst college team.
