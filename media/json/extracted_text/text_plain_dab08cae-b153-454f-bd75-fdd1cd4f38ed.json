Among these<br />\nare the limiting of the entrance examinations to September; the possibility of substituting three years<br />\nof Greek, French, German or Spanish, or two years in each of two of<br />\nthese languages, for the three years<br />\nof Greek or the two years of French<br />\nand German formerly required; and<br />\nthe abolition of drawing as an entrance requirement.<br />\nThese changes all tend to make<br />\nentrance into the undergraduate<br />\ncourses easier. Many a student has<br />\neither relinquished the idea of ent-ance altogether or come in laden<br />\nwith conditions, as a result of failure to take the *necessary three<br />\nyears' work in Greek or the corresponding two in French and German. Such failure has often been<br />\nthe result of ignorance of the requirements or of insurmountable<br />\nobstacles in the student's preparatory school curriculum. Again,<br />\nmany students have been forced to<br />\ntake up languages in these schools<br />\nin which they had no interest and<br />\nwhich were not as well adapted to<br />\ntheir future vocations as would have<br />\nbeen work in other languages.<br />\nThe recognition of Spanish also<br />\nwill aid those who wish to take up<br />\nthis language in preparatory school,<br />\nbut, because of the entrance regulations to be obtained, have been<br />\nunable to follow their inclinations.<br />\nEntrance examinations have<br />\nhitherto been held in both September and June. The setting of the<br />\nformer month as the official time<br />\nof these examinations, however,<br />\ndoes not exclude the taking of the<br />\nJune examinations. Those who<br />\nprefer to take the latter are still<br />\nable to do so, only, instead of the<br />\nHopkins examinations, they will<br />\ntake the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board.<br />\nThese examinations will be given in<br />\nthe Academic Building of the University at Homewood from June 19<br />\nto 24, 1916, inclusive. For these<br />\nexaminations, the Board charges a<br />\nfee of five dollars, payable before<br />\nJune 5, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nPlans for the taking of the Senior<br />\nClass pictures for the Hullabaloo<br />\nhave been announced and the class<br />\nbanquet committee has been appointed. \u2022<br />\nThe arrangements for the taking<br />\nof the class pictures are the most<br />\nnovel ever undertaken by any graduating class. The plans were announced at the class meeting last<br />\nTuesday, and all were instructed<br />\nto subm:t the time which will be<br />\nmost convenient for their sittings.<br />\nThe pictures will be taken on the<br />\ntop floor of the physics laboratory.<br />\nFor this purpose the entire upper<br />\nfloor of the building has been temporarily converted into a studio,<br />\nwhich will be occupied by White,<br />\nthe New York photographer. Mr.<br />\nWhite has a national reputation for<br />\nthe theatrical portraits he has made<br />\nfor the best of the current magazines, and his work is considered<br />\namong authorities as among the best<br />\nin the country.<br />\nThe taking of the pictures will<br />\nbegin this Tuesday. Each member<br />\nof the Class of 1916 will be photographed at the time which is most<br />\nconvenient to him, and six photographs will be taken of each man,<br />\nfrom which he may take his pick.<br />\nThe price of each picture appearing in the Hullabaloo will be two<br />\ndollars and fifty cents, and there<br />\nwill be a reduction of one dollar to<br />\nall seniors who have more than four<br />\ndollars' worth of pictures finished.<br />\nThe senior banquet committee is<br />\nas follows: Samuel Leithiser,<br />\nchairman; Luke Vickers, Franklin<br />\nLudington, Clarence McDowell and<br />\nEdmund Spieker. The banquet is<br />\nexpected to take place sometime<br />\nnext month, and the committee expresses itself as confident that, from<br />\npoint of view of both material and<br />\nconviviality, it will be one of the<br />\nbest ever given by a senior class.<br />\nAfter the appointment of the banquet committee, President Tingley<br />\nannounced that the senior \"party\"<br />\nwould take place at the end of the<br />\nyear. He also read to the class<br />\nextracts from a,letter of the \"Hullabaloo\" engraver, in which the art<br />\nproductions which had been sent in<br />\nwere very highly praised.<br />\n<br />\nChess Tournament Begins.<br />\n<br />\nhonors. The schedule of the tournament has just been announced.<br />\nEach entrant is to play eleven<br />\nmatches\u2014one with each other contestant.<br />\nThose entered for the tournament<br />\nare: Helfrich, Hobelman, Edlavitch,<br />\nBrower, Melamet, Doerman, Gutman, Taylor, Dryden, Hammond,<br />\nBranham and Kloskey.<br />\n<br />\nThe way in which the track team<br />\nstarted its season, by defeating the<br />\nathletes of the Baltimore Athletic<br />\nAssociation Saturday night in the<br />\ncage by the overwhelming score of<br />\n58 to 28, makes the prospects look<br />\nparticularly bright for the heavy<br />\nschedule which has been undertaken<br />\nthis season, for the performance in<br />\nthis first meet was certainly one of<br />\nan all-around, well-balanced organization. The Black and Blue broke<br />\nthe tape in every one of the track<br />\ncontests, with the exception of the<br />\n30-yard hurdles, and secured first<br />\nplace in two of the three field<br />\nevents, besides winning the relay.<br />\nThe only cage record equalled<br />\nwas in the mile run, in which Weeks<br />\nnosed out Perkins at the tape, having covered the distance in 4<br />\nutes 54Y5 seconds. It is a pleasure<br />\nminto see anything done well, and the<br />\ncoaches and rooters were alike delighted at the masterly way in<br />\nwhich four members of the J. H. U.<br />\ndistance squad handled this piece of<br />\nwork. Rosen set the pace for the<br />\nfirst half of the race, and it was<br />\none well calculated to give Hopkins<br />\nevery advantage of the training her<br />\nrunners have had, beginning with<br />\nthe cross-country work in the fall.<br />\nFor the rest of the distance, Weeks<br />\npressed Perkins hard, making him<br />\nrun the race of his life, and Bullard<br />\nstuck close behind these two. In<br />\nthe last 20-yard straight-away,<br />\nWeeks gave a terrific spurt, snatching victory from Perkins by inches.<br />\nGreat things are expected from this<br />\nclever distance quartet in the dual<br />\nmeets this spring.<br />\nThe final event, a 1,600-yard relay, was a thriller. The Baltimore<br />\nAthletic Association men had saved<br />\ntwo fresh men and they summoned<br />\nall their energy for a final effort.<br />\nAnother feature that added special<br />\ninterest to the race was the fact<br />\nthat Huntley Lloyd, former Hopkins star relay man, was competing<br />\nagainst the Black and Blue. The<br />\nBaltimore Athletic Association men<br />\ngot the jump with the gun, but the<br />\nfirst men on the contesting teams<br />\nfinished neck and neck. Uhler got<br />\nthe start and increased the Hopkins<br />\nlead to half a lap, but Sutton, who<br />\nhad already broken the tape in both<br />\nof the sprinting events and was<br />\nworn out, lost nearly all of this advantage. Fred Hall got a slight<br />\nstart on Huntley Lloyd and their<br />\nfour laps around the cage was a<br />\nhard fight for every yard. On the<br />\nlast back-stretch, Lloyd pulled up<br />\nalmost abreast of his opponent, but<br />\nthe latter made a spurt around the<br />\n<br />\nAt the nineteenth annual interclass debate and public speaking<br />\ncontest, held last Friday evening<br />\nin McCoy Hall, the seniors defeated<br />\nthe juniors in a hotly contested<br />\nstruggle, and the Adams medal was<br />\nwon by Morton K. Rothschild.<br />\nThe public speaking contest,<br />\nwhich occupied the first place on<br />\nthe program, was one of the most<br />\ninteresting which has been heard in<br />\nMcCoy Hall in recent years. The<br />\nthree speakers were all of high calibre, and the selections which they<br />\ngave were such as to hold the audiench from the first word to the last.<br />\nRobert R. Duncan, the first speaker, gave Senator Thurston's speech<br />\non \"Intervention in Cuba.\" He<br />\nspoke in a clear, well-modulated<br />\nvoice, and the interpretation which<br />\nhe gave to Thurston's stirring appeal was excellent. Reuben Oppenheimer, the next speaker, gave Senator Hoar's speech on \"America and<br />\nthe Philippines.\" He also interpreted his speech well, using his<br />\nvoice to the best advantage. Morton K. Rothschild, the last speaker,<br />\ngave President Wilson's speech on<br />\n\"The Significance of the Civil War.\"<br />\nHis voice was extremely good, and<br />\nhis graceful, clean-cut gestures<br />\nserved to bring out his quiet eloquence to its full advantage.<br />\nThe subject of the debate was<br />\n\"Resolved, that for State legislatures a unicameral is preferable to<br />\na bicameral system.\" The juniors<br />\nupheld the affirmative of this ques*tion, the seniors the negative.<br />\nThe junior team was composed<br />\nof Alexander A. Weech, Randolph<br />\nSmith and Alexander A. Steinbach,<br />\nchairman; Lawrence H. Baker was<br />\nalternate and Frederick P. Hall, adviser. The senior team consisted<br />\nof Harrison C. Coffin, George F.<br />\nLudington and Thomas J. Tingley,<br />\nchairman; with Manuel G. Gichner,<br />\nalternate, and Clarence W. McDowell, adviser.<br />\nWeech, opening the debate, attacked the bicameral system of legislature and outlined the plan which<br />\nthe affirmative was proposing. He<br />\nspoke quietly and deliberately and<br />\nseemed thoroughly at home upon<br />\nthe platform. Coffin, the first speaker for the negative, plunged into his<br />\nsubject almost immediately, hurling<br />\nshaft after shaft of stinging sarcasm at his opponents, and brilliantly defending the system which they<br />\nhad attacked. Smith, the second<br />\nspeaker for the affirmative, continued along the lines which Weech<br />\nhad outlined.

It does so,<br />\nnot because a course of military<br />\ntraining was favored, but because<br />\nthe Class of 1917 possessed enough<br />\ninitiative to put itself on record in<br />\nregard to one of the most weighty<br />\nquestions which is agitating not only<br />\nthis University, but every college<br />\nand university in the United States.<br />\nThe question of national defense<br />\nhas swept over this country like a<br />\nwhirlwind. Twelve months ago,<br />\nHopkins would have regarded a<br />\nproposal to institute a course of<br />\nmilitary training within its conservative walls only as a question<br />\nfor a somewhat far-fetched collegiate debate. Now that proposal has<br />\nbeen endorsed by one-fourth of the<br />\nundergraduate student body.<br />\nThis question concerns the students, and, before any decision is<br />\nreached which would commit the<br />\nHopkins of the future to a set<br />\ncourse of action, student opinion<br />\nshould go on record as to what that<br />\ndecision should be. The Junior<br />\nClass has made the first step; the<br />\nthree other classes should follow,<br />\nand follow immediately.<br />\n<br />\nWanted\u2014Participants.<br />\n<br />\nThe interclass debate of last Friday evening gave to the attendant<br />\npublic, and, incidentally, to a fair<br />\nproportion of Hopkins' students, an<br />\ninsight into a phase of Hopkins'<br />\nactivities which only comes into the<br />\npublic sight at rather long intervals,<br />\nand which consequently does not<br />\n'attract the constant attention which<br />\nis accorded to athletic activities.<br />\nThat this activity, when, for a brief<br />\ntime, it does hold the stage, is amply capable of occupying it in an interesting manner, was proved by the<br />\nlarge crowd which witnessed the<br />\ncontest last Friday, and that it represents Hopkins to good advantage<br />\nwas shown by the speeches of the<br />\ndebaters themselves.<br />\nWithin two or three weeks, tryouts will be held for places on the<br />\n'Varsity teams which are sent out<br />\nto meet the teams of North Carolina and Virginia. For three successive years, Hopkins has been<br />\nthe winner of this triangular debate, and its success has attracted<br />\nattention in the debating circles of<br />\ncolleges throughout the country.<br />\nIn the past, the idea seems to<br />\nhave prevailed that these teams were<br />\nchosen almost entirely from the<br />\nmen who took part in the seniorjunior debates: While the majority<br />\nof 'Varsity debaters undoubtedly<br />\nhave been chosen from this material, the idea in itself is erroneous.<br />\nParticipation in the try-outs is open<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE SQUAD SHOWS UP WELL<br />\nMore Freshmen Should Come Out at<br />\nOnce, Says Coach Wolfe\u2014Progress<br />\nof the Team Excellent.<br />\n<br />\nThe recent work of the lacrosse<br />\nsquad has been very encouraging.<br />\nHead Coach Wolfe was delighted<br />\nwith the spirit and enthusiasm displayed in a practice game held<br />\nfollowing the freshman-sophomore<br />\ntrack meet. The team is not as<br />\nfar advanced as it should be at this<br />\ntime of the year, but if the men<br />\nkeep up their excellent work this<br />\nhandicap will soon be overcome.<br />\nCoach Wolfe gave a \"chalk\" talk<br />\nlast Saturday.<br />\nAt present, the coach expects to<br />\nbegin outdoor practice at Homewood in less than two months, and<br />\nthe meantime will be spent in perfecting the men in stick-work. Four<br />\ndays a week are spent on this feature of the game. Wednesday and<br />\nSaturday are devoted to team work<br />\nand scrimmages.<br />\nAlthough the last appeal for more<br />\nmen was answered in some measure, there is a great need for more<br />\nfreshmen, and if the members of<br />\nthe freshmen class do not immediately respond to that call the hope<br />\nfor the future of the team will be<br />\ndarkened. New men are not only<br />\nneeded for future championships<br />\nbut also for the present. Mr. Paul<br />\nW. Sutton, the captain of the team,<br />\nwill gladly see any man who is interested in lacrosse, and will give<br />\nhim any desired information.<br />\nSince Carlisle has dropped athletics entirely, the lacrosse team has<br />\nbeen forced to cancel its dates with<br />\nthat college, and the schedule has<br />\nhad to be readjusted. Consequently, it is not yet possible to announce<br />\nthe coming program, but the coaches promise one of the strongest<br />\nschedules ever followed.<br />\nto every undergraduate; there is no<br />\nregulation and no tradition that any<br />\nbut the best men in those try-outs<br />\nshall be chosen.<br />\nAgain, the fact that for the past<br />\nfew years the subject of the interclass debate has been the subject<br />\nof the triangular contest has discouraged many. This year that<br />\nhandicap has been removed. The<br />\nsubject of the triangular debate is<br />\nentirely different from that debated last Friday night\u2014and so the<br />\nlast excuse of the reluctant is obviated.<br />\nThe men who will go down to<br />\nNorth Carolina and Virginia in<br />\nApril will represent Hopkins. As<br />\nthey will be judged, so will all Hopkins be judged; and the honor of<br />\ntheir position is to be measured by<br />\nits responsibility.<br />\nLet every man who has had any<br />\nexperience in debating or in public<br />\nspeaking be present at the coming<br />\ntry-outs, that the teams which are<br />\nto be chosen may represent the pick<br />\nof Hopkins' material, and that they<br />\nmay continue the Hopkins debating<br />\ntradition of uninterrupted victory:<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\nMonday, January 31<br />\n3.00 P.

Non-graduates are not excluded, but each case<br />\nwill be decided on its merits with a<br />\nview to maintaining a level in the<br />\nprogressive scheme of development.<br />\nThe training given at these camps is<br />\nvery intensive, covering in a period<br />\nof four weeks as much as possible<br />\nof the fundamental education of an<br />\nofficer. This calls for a well-trained<br />\nmind. In the second place, past experience has shown that this class<br />\nof young men is the first to join the<br />\ncolors in time of war, and many of<br />\nthem regardless of their skill in<br />\nmilitary matters receive commissions. This has been the procedure<br />\nin times past. It is right and necessary that these young men should be<br />\nfully informed,as to the tremendous<br />\nresponsibility which will come to<br />\nthem with the command of men and<br />\nthe irreparable loss which may be<br />\ncaused by unskilled leadership.<br />\nFurthermore, as citizens of military age and as members of the unorganized militia under the constitution, it is necessary for the intelligent discharge of their military obligations that they should be as well<br />\ninformed as possible on these matters. The President has said in a<br />\nrecent message * * * \"it will<br />\nbe right enough, right American<br />\npolicy, based upon our accustomed<br />\nprinciples and practices, to provide<br />\na system by which every citizen who<br />\nwill volunteer for the training may<br />\nbe made familiar with ,the use of<br />\nmodern arms, the rudiments of drill<br />\nand maneuver, and the maintenance<br />\nand sanitation of camps. We should<br />\nencourage such training and make<br />\nit a means of discipline which our<br />\nyoung men will learn to value.\"<br />\n* * *<br />\nAt these camps great stress is laid<br />\nupon personal hygiene and camp sanitation and a serious effort is made to<br />\nteach men how to take care of themselves in camp and at maneuvers, as<br />\nwell as to familiarize them with the<br />\nuse of arms. The conduct of the<br />\ncamps tends to establish habits of<br />\npromptness and exactness, and to<br />\nthe careful observance and prompt<br />\nexecution of instructions. A serious<br />\n<br />\neffort is made through lectures to<br />\nconvey a sound and correct idea of<br />\nthe military policy of the United<br />\nStates as exemplified, by our past<br />\nwars and particular attention is<br />\ngiven to the general subject of military history.<br />\nSecondary to these more serious<br />\npurposes of the camp, there is to<br />\nbe considered the physical benefit<br />\nof a healthy, out-of-doors life,<br />\nvigorous exercise, discipline, good<br />\nfood and association With a fine lot<br />\nof men from every section of the<br />\ncountry with whom, as past experience shows, a very intimate bond<br />\nis formed based on hard work in<br />\ncamp and maneuvers and the consciousness of serving a good cause.<br />\nFor these reasons national statesmen and legislators, famous lawyers, great bankers and merchants,<br />\nand many high state and city officials have stood elbow to elbow in<br />\nthe ranks, at such camps, with men<br />\nwho labor for a daily wage, and<br />\nboth are prowl of it.<br />\nThe whole effect of the camps<br />\nhas been excellent both from the<br />\nstandpoint of increasing the sense<br />\nof each man's responsibility to the<br />\nnation for service and his obligation<br />\nto fit himself to render it effectively<br />\nand efficiently.<br />\nAttendance at the camp will not<br />\nincrease either the legal or moral<br />\nobligation of those who attend.<br />\nThe intention is merely to equip<br />\nthose taking the course of training<br />\nto fulfill with more efficiency and<br />\nusefulness obligations which are already laid upon them as citizens of<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nVery sincerely yours,<br />\n.LEONARD WOOD,<br />\nMajor General U.

Among these<br />\nare the limiting of the entrance examinations to September; the possibility of substituting three years<br />\nof Greek, French, German or Spanish, or two years in each of two of<br />\nthese languages, for the three years<br />\nof Greek or the two years of French<br />\nand German formerly required; and<br />\nthe abolition of drawing as an entrance requirement.<br />\nThese changes all tend to make<br />\nentrance into the undergraduate<br />\ncourses easier. Many a student has<br />\neither relinquished the idea of ent-ance altogether or come in laden<br />\nwith conditions, as a result of failure to take the *necessary three<br />\nyears' work in Greek or the corresponding two in French and German. Such failure has often been<br />\nthe result of ignorance of the requirements or of insurmountable<br />\nobstacles in the student's preparatory school curriculum. Again,<br />\nmany students have been forced to<br />\ntake up languages in these schools<br />\nin which they had no interest and<br />\nwhich were not as well adapted to<br />\ntheir future vocations as would have<br />\nbeen work in other languages.<br />\nThe recognition of Spanish also<br />\nwill aid those who wish to take up<br />\nthis language in preparatory school,<br />\nbut, because of the entrance regulations to be obtained, have been<br />\nunable to follow their inclinations.<br />\nEntrance examinations have<br />\nhitherto been held in both September and June. The setting of the<br />\nformer month as the official time<br />\nof these examinations, however,<br />\ndoes not exclude the taking of the<br />\nJune examinations. Those who<br />\nprefer to take the latter are still<br />\nable to do so, only, instead of the<br />\nHopkins examinations, they will<br />\ntake the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board.<br />\nThese examinations will be given in<br />\nthe Academic Building of the University at Homewood from June 19<br />\nto 24, 1916, inclusive. For these<br />\nexaminations, the Board charges a<br />\nfee of five dollars, payable before<br />\nJune 5, 1916.<br /><br />\nPlans for the taking of the Senior<br />\nClass pictures for the Hullabaloo<br />\nhave been announced and the class<br />\nbanquet committee has been appointed. \u2022<br />\nThe arrangements for the taking<br />\nof the class pictures are the most<br />\nnovel ever undertaken by any graduating class. The plans were announced at the class meeting last<br />\nTuesday, and all were instructed<br />\nto subm:t the time which will be<br />\nmost convenient for their sittings.<br />\nThe pictures will be taken on the<br />\ntop floor of the physics laboratory.<br />\nFor this purpose the entire upper<br />\nfloor of the building has been temporarily converted into a studio,<br />\nwhich will be occupied by White,<br />\nthe New York photographer. Mr.<br />\nWhite has a national reputation for<br />\nthe theatrical portraits he has made<br />\nfor the best of the current magazines, and his work is considered<br />\namong authorities as among the best<br />\nin the country.<br />\nThe taking of the pictures will<br />\nbegin this Tuesday. Each member<br />\nof the Class of 1916 will be photographed at the time which is most<br />\nconvenient to him, and six photographs will be taken of each man,<br />\nfrom which he may take his pick.<br />\nThe price of each picture appearing in the Hullabaloo will be two<br />\ndollars and fifty cents, and there<br />\nwill be a reduction of one dollar to<br />\nall seniors who have more than four<br />\ndollars' worth of pictures finished.<br />\nThe senior banquet committee is<br />\nas follows: Samuel Leithiser,<br />\nchairman; Luke Vickers, Franklin<br />\nLudington, Clarence McDowell and<br />\nEdmund Spieker. The banquet is<br />\nexpected to take place sometime<br />\nnext month, and the committee expresses itself as confident that, from<br />\npoint of view of both material and<br />\nconviviality, it will be one of the<br />\nbest ever given by a senior class.<br />\nAfter the appointment of the banquet committee, President Tingley<br />\nannounced that the senior \"party\"<br />\nwould take place at the end of the<br />\nyear.

The schedule of the tournament has just been announced.<br />\nEach entrant is to play eleven<br />\nmatches\u2014one with each other contestant.<br />\nThose entered for the tournament<br />\nare: Helfrich, Hobelman, Edlavitch,<br />\nBrower, Melamet, Doerman, Gutman, Taylor, Dryden, Hammond,<br />\nBranham and Kloskey.<br /><br />\nThe way in which the track team<br />\nstarted its season, by defeating the<br />\nathletes of the Baltimore Athletic<br />\nAssociation Saturday night in the<br />\ncage by the overwhelming score of<br />\n58 to 28, makes the prospects look<br />\nparticularly bright for the heavy<br />\nschedule which has been undertaken<br />\nthis season, for the performance in<br />\nthis first meet was certainly one of<br />\nan all-around, well-balanced organization. The Black and Blue broke<br />\nthe tape in every one of the track<br />\ncontests, with the exception of the<br />\n30-yard hurdles, and secured first<br />\nplace in two of the three field<br />\nevents, besides winning the relay.<br />\nThe only cage record equalled<br />\nwas in the mile run, in which Weeks<br />\nnosed out Perkins at the tape, having covered the distance in 4<br />\nutes 54Y5 seconds. It is a pleasure<br />\nminto see anything done well, and the<br />\ncoaches and rooters were alike delighted at the masterly way in<br />\nwhich four members of the J. H. U.<br />\ndistance squad handled this piece of<br />\nwork. Rosen set the pace for the<br />\nfirst half of the race, and it was<br />\none well calculated to give Hopkins<br />\nevery advantage of the training her<br />\nrunners have had, beginning with<br />\nthe cross-country work in the fall.<br />\nFor the rest of the distance, Weeks<br />\npressed Perkins hard, making him<br />\nrun the race of his life, and Bullard<br />\nstuck close behind these two. In<br />\nthe last 20-yard straight-away,<br />\nWeeks gave a terrific spurt, snatching victory from Perkins by inches.<br />\nGreat things are expected from this<br />\nclever distance quartet in the dual<br />\nmeets this spring.<br />\nThe final event, a 1,600-yard relay, was a thriller. The Baltimore<br />\nAthletic Association men had saved<br />\ntwo fresh men and they summoned<br />\nall their energy for a final effort.<br />\nAnother feature that added special<br />\ninterest to the race was the fact<br />\nthat Huntley Lloyd, former Hopkins star relay man, was competing<br />\nagainst the Black and Blue. The<br />\nBaltimore Athletic Association men<br />\ngot the jump with the gun, but the<br />\nfirst men on the contesting teams<br />\nfinished neck and neck. Uhler got<br />\nthe start and increased the Hopkins<br />\nlead to half a lap, but Sutton, who<br />\nhad already broken the tape in both<br />\nof the sprinting events and was<br />\nworn out, lost nearly all of this advantage. Fred Hall got a slight<br />\nstart on Huntley Lloyd and their<br />\nfour laps around the cage was a<br />\nhard fight for every yard. On the<br />\nlast back-stretch, Lloyd pulled up<br />\nalmost abreast of his opponent, but<br />\nthe latter made a spurt around the<br /><br />\nAt the nineteenth annual interclass debate and public speaking<br />\ncontest, held last Friday evening<br />\nin McCoy Hall, the seniors defeated<br />\nthe juniors in a hotly contested<br />\nstruggle, and the Adams medal was<br />\nwon by Morton K. Rothschild.<br />\nThe public speaking contest,<br />\nwhich occupied the first place on<br />\nthe program, was one of the most<br />\ninteresting which has been heard in<br />\nMcCoy Hall in recent years. The<br />\nthree speakers were all of high calibre, and the selections which they<br />\ngave were such as to hold the audiench from the first word to the last.<br />\nRobert R. Duncan, the first speaker, gave Senator Thurston's speech<br />\non \"Intervention in Cuba.\" He<br />\nspoke in a clear, well-modulated<br />\nvoice, and the interpretation which<br />\nhe gave to Thurston's stirring appeal was excellent. Reuben Oppenheimer, the next speaker, gave Senator Hoar's speech on \"America and<br />\nthe Philippines.\" He also interpreted his speech well, using his<br />\nvoice to the best advantage. Morton K. Rothschild, the last speaker,<br />\ngave President Wilson's speech on<br />\n\"The Significance of the Civil War.\"<br />\nHis voice was extremely good, and<br />\nhis graceful, clean-cut gestures<br />\nserved to bring out his quiet eloquence to its full advantage.<br />\nThe subject of the debate was<br />\n\"Resolved, that for State legislatures a unicameral is preferable to<br />\na bicameral system.\" The juniors<br />\nupheld the affirmative of this ques*tion, the seniors the negative.<br />\nThe junior team was composed<br />\nof Alexander A. Weech, Randolph<br />\nSmith and Alexander A. Steinbach,<br />\nchairman; Lawrence H. Baker was<br />\nalternate and Frederick P. Hall, adviser. The senior team consisted<br />\nof Harrison C. Coffin, George F.<br />\nLudington and Thomas J. Tingley,<br />\nchairman; with Manuel G. Gichner,<br />\nalternate, and Clarence W. McDowell, adviser.<br />\nWeech, opening the debate, attacked the bicameral system of legislature and outlined the plan which<br />\nthe affirmative was proposing. He<br />\nspoke quietly and deliberately and<br />\nseemed thoroughly at home upon<br />\nthe platform. Coffin, the first speaker for the negative, plunged into his<br />\nsubject almost immediately, hurling<br />\nshaft after shaft of stinging sarcasm at his opponents, and brilliantly defending the system which they<br />\nhad attacked.

It does so,<br />\nnot because a course of military<br />\ntraining was favored, but because<br />\nthe Class of 1917 possessed enough<br />\ninitiative to put itself on record in<br />\nregard to one of the most weighty<br />\nquestions which is agitating not only<br />\nthis University, but every college<br />\nand university in the United States.<br />\nThe question of national defense<br />\nhas swept over this country like a<br />\nwhirlwind. Twelve months ago,<br />\nHopkins would have regarded a<br />\nproposal to institute a course of<br />\nmilitary training within its conservative walls only as a question<br />\nfor a somewhat far-fetched collegiate debate. Now that proposal has<br />\nbeen endorsed by one-fourth of the<br />\nundergraduate student body.<br />\nThis question concerns the students, and, before any decision is<br />\nreached which would commit the<br />\nHopkins of the future to a set<br />\ncourse of action, student opinion<br />\nshould go on record as to what that<br />\ndecision should be. The Junior<br />\nClass has made the first step; the<br />\nthree other classes should follow,<br />\nand follow immediately.<br /><br />\nWanted\u2014Participants.<br /><br />\nThe interclass debate of last Friday evening gave to the attendant<br />\npublic, and, incidentally, to a fair<br />\nproportion of Hopkins' students, an<br />\ninsight into a phase of Hopkins'<br />\nactivities which only comes into the<br />\npublic sight at rather long intervals,<br />\nand which consequently does not<br />\n'attract the constant attention which<br />\nis accorded to athletic activities.<br />\nThat this activity, when, for a brief<br />\ntime, it does hold the stage, is amply capable of occupying it in an interesting manner, was proved by the<br />\nlarge crowd which witnessed the<br />\ncontest last Friday, and that it represents Hopkins to good advantage<br />\nwas shown by the speeches of the<br />\ndebaters themselves.<br />\nWithin two or three weeks, tryouts will be held for places on the<br />\n'Varsity teams which are sent out<br />\nto meet the teams of North Carolina and Virginia. For three successive years, Hopkins has been<br />\nthe winner of this triangular debate, and its success has attracted<br />\nattention in the debating circles of<br />\ncolleges throughout the country.<br />\nIn the past, the idea seems to<br />\nhave prevailed that these teams were<br />\nchosen almost entirely from the<br />\nmen who took part in the seniorjunior debates: While the majority<br />\nof 'Varsity debaters undoubtedly<br />\nhave been chosen from this material, the idea in itself is erroneous.<br />\nParticipation in the try-outs is open<br /><br />\nLACROSSE SQUAD SHOWS UP WELL<br />\nMore Freshmen Should Come Out at<br />\nOnce, Says Coach Wolfe\u2014Progress<br />\nof the Team Excellent.<br /><br />\nThe recent work of the lacrosse<br />\nsquad has been very encouraging.<br />\nHead Coach Wolfe was delighted<br />\nwith the spirit and enthusiasm displayed in a practice game held<br />\nfollowing the freshman-sophomore<br />\ntrack meet. The team is not as<br />\nfar advanced as it should be at this<br />\ntime of the year, but if the men<br />\nkeep up their excellent work this<br />\nhandicap will soon be overcome.<br />\nCoach Wolfe gave a \"chalk\" talk<br />\nlast Saturday.<br />\nAt present, the coach expects to<br />\nbegin outdoor practice at Homewood in less than two months, and<br />\nthe meantime will be spent in perfecting the men in stick-work. Four<br />\ndays a week are spent on this feature of the game. Wednesday and<br />\nSaturday are devoted to team work<br />\nand scrimmages.<br />\nAlthough the last appeal for more<br />\nmen was answered in some measure, there is a great need for more<br />\nfreshmen, and if the members of<br />\nthe freshmen class do not immediately respond to that call the hope<br />\nfor the future of the team will be<br />\ndarkened. New men are not only<br />\nneeded for future championships<br />\nbut also for the present. Mr. Paul<br />\nW. Sutton, the captain of the team,<br />\nwill gladly see any man who is interested in lacrosse, and will give<br />\nhim any desired information.<br />\nSince Carlisle has dropped athletics entirely, the lacrosse team has<br />\nbeen forced to cancel its dates with<br />\nthat college, and the schedule has<br />\nhad to be readjusted. Consequently, it is not yet possible to announce<br />\nthe coming program, but the coaches promise one of the strongest<br />\nschedules ever followed.<br />\nto every undergraduate; there is no<br />\nregulation and no tradition that any<br />\nbut the best men in those try-outs<br />\nshall be chosen.<br />\nAgain, the fact that for the past<br />\nfew years the subject of the interclass debate has been the subject<br />\nof the triangular contest has discouraged many. This year that<br />\nhandicap has been removed. The<br />\nsubject of the triangular debate is<br />\nentirely different from that debated last Friday night\u2014and so the<br />\nlast excuse of the reluctant is obviated.<br />\nThe men who will go down to<br />\nNorth Carolina and Virginia in<br />\nApril will represent Hopkins. As<br />\nthey will be judged, so will all Hopkins be judged; and the honor of<br />\ntheir position is to be measured by<br />\nits responsibility.<br />\nLet every man who has had any<br />\nexperience in debating or in public<br />\nspeaking be present at the coming<br />\ntry-outs, that the teams which are<br />\nto be chosen may represent the pick<br />\nof Hopkins' material, and that they<br />\nmay continue the Hopkins debating<br />\ntradition of uninterrupted victory:<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\nMonday, January 31<br />\n3.00 P.

Non-graduates are not excluded, but each case<br />\nwill be decided on its merits with a<br />\nview to maintaining a level in the<br />\nprogressive scheme of development.<br />\nThe training given at these camps is<br />\nvery intensive, covering in a period<br />\nof four weeks as much as possible<br />\nof the fundamental education of an<br />\nofficer. This calls for a well-trained<br />\nmind. In the second place, past experience has shown that this class<br />\nof young men is the first to join the<br />\ncolors in time of war, and many of<br />\nthem regardless of their skill in<br />\nmilitary matters receive commissions. This has been the procedure<br />\nin times past. It is right and necessary that these young men should be<br />\nfully informed,as to the tremendous<br />\nresponsibility which will come to<br />\nthem with the command of men and<br />\nthe irreparable loss which may be<br />\ncaused by unskilled leadership.<br />\nFurthermore, as citizens of military age and as members of the unorganized militia under the constitution, it is necessary for the intelligent discharge of their military obligations that they should be as well<br />\ninformed as possible on these matters. The President has said in a<br />\nrecent message * * * \"it will<br />\nbe right enough, right American<br />\npolicy, based upon our accustomed<br />\nprinciples and practices, to provide<br />\na system by which every citizen who<br />\nwill volunteer for the training may<br />\nbe made familiar with ,the use of<br />\nmodern arms, the rudiments of drill<br />\nand maneuver, and the maintenance<br />\nand sanitation of camps. We should<br />\nencourage such training and make<br />\nit a means of discipline which our<br />\nyoung men will learn to value.\"<br />\n* * *<br />\nAt these camps great stress is laid<br />\nupon personal hygiene and camp sanitation and a serious effort is made to<br />\nteach men how to take care of themselves in camp and at maneuvers, as<br />\nwell as to familiarize them with the<br />\nuse of arms. The conduct of the<br />\ncamps tends to establish habits of<br />\npromptness and exactness, and to<br />\nthe careful observance and prompt<br />\nexecution of instructions. A serious<br /><br />\neffort is made through lectures to<br />\nconvey a sound and correct idea of<br />\nthe military policy of the United<br />\nStates as exemplified, by our past<br />\nwars and particular attention is<br />\ngiven to the general subject of military history.<br />\nSecondary to these more serious<br />\npurposes of the camp, there is to<br />\nbe considered the physical benefit<br />\nof a healthy, out-of-doors life,<br />\nvigorous exercise, discipline, good<br />\nfood and association With a fine lot<br />\nof men from every section of the<br />\ncountry with whom, as past experience shows, a very intimate bond<br />\nis formed based on hard work in<br />\ncamp and maneuvers and the consciousness of serving a good cause.<br />\nFor these reasons national statesmen and legislators, famous lawyers, great bankers and merchants,<br />\nand many high state and city officials have stood elbow to elbow in<br />\nthe ranks, at such camps, with men<br />\nwho labor for a daily wage, and<br />\nboth are prowl of it.<br />\nThe whole effect of the camps<br />\nhas been excellent both from the<br />\nstandpoint of increasing the sense<br />\nof each man's responsibility to the<br />\nnation for service and his obligation<br />\nto fit himself to render it effectively<br />\nand efficiently.<br />\nAttendance at the camp will not<br />\nincrease either the legal or moral<br />\nobligation of those who attend.<br />\nThe intention is merely to equip<br />\nthose taking the course of training<br />\nto fulfill with more efficiency and<br />\nusefulness obligations which are already laid upon them as citizens of<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nVery sincerely yours,<br />\n.LEONARD WOOD,<br />\nMajor General U.

The authorities to whom<br />\nhe wrote concerning this question<br />\ndisagree widely.<br />\nErnest Thompson Seton says:<br />\n\"The story of woodpeckers getting<br />\ndrunk on fermented sap is an absurd fable.\" John Burroughs answers: \"Both. birds and insect's<br />\nmight get drunk on the fermented<br />\nsap.\" Ernest H. Baynes says: \"I<br />\ndo not think it impossible, perhaps<br />\nnot improbable.\"<br />\nProfessor Watson's answer is:<br />\n\"I have seen robins in a `loggy' condition upon very ripe berries in the<br />\nSouth.\"<br /><br />\nThe best part of<br />\naMURAD you<br />\ncannot describe.<br />\nBut you recognize<br />\nit instantly.
