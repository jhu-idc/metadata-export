The Council objects to<br />\nthe BSU policy of extending its<br />\nmembership solely to black<br />\nstudents on the grounds that<br />\nexclusiveness of membership is a<br />\nterrible evil that cannot be<br />\nsanctioned. What is lost sight of<br />\nby such argument are the reasons<br />\nwhy exclusiveness of membership<br />\n- - or, more generally, segregation - is generally considered to be<br />\nmorally wrong. Chief among these<br />\nare that such policy inhibits<br />\nunderstanding between groups<br />\nand consequently breeds mutual<br />\ndistrust; that such policy is<br />\nconducive to the preferential<br />\ntreatment of certain groups to the<br />\ndetriment of others; and that both<br />\ndistrust and preferential treatment<br />\n(inequality) distrust, and mutual<br />\nhatred are morally objectionable,<br />\nsegregation including exclusivity<br />\nof membership is generally<br />\ncondemned because it usually<br />\nfosters them. When, however, a<br />\npolicy<br />\nwhich is normally<br />\nconducive to something morally<br />\nobjectionable is in a given instance<br />\neither not so conducive or, more<br />\nparticularly, conducive to a good<br />\nend, then to persist in regarding<br />\nthe said policy as morally<br />\nobjectionable in this instance not<br />\nonly is gravely mistaken, but also<br />\nis itself morally objectionable.<br />\nUpon a little reflection, it is<br />\nclear that the membership policy<br />\nof the BSU is such an instance.<br />\nFirst of all, it is not conducive to<br />\nany evil end. For will the BSU<br />\nmembership policy foster<br />\ninequality between the various<br />\ncampus groups? The answer is<br />\n\"no\": the BSU asks only the<br />\ntreatment accorded other campus<br />\norganizations. Will the BSU<br />\nmembership policy foster mistrust<br />\nbetween it and other campus<br />\ngroups? Obviously not. On th<br />\ncontrary, it seeks to establish<br />\nmutual understanding and its<br />\nconsequent trust between black<br />\nand white students on campus<br />\nSecondly, and more importantly,<br />\nthis policy promotes various good<br />\nends. As John Guest and others<br />\nhave pointed out, the totally<br />\nblack membership of the<br />\norganization will enable it to<br />\ncreate more effectively in its<br />\nmembers an increased sense of<br />\nblack identity. Needless to say, an<br />\nawareness of, and consequent<br />\n<br />\npride in, who one is is a good<br />\nthing. Moreover, the presence of a<br />\ndeterminate body of black<br />\nstudents on campus will serve to<br />\ndraw additional black students to<br />\nHopkins with resultant benefit<br />\nboth for the University<br />\ncommunity and for society at<br />\nlarge.<br />\nThe membership policy of BSU<br />\nclearly fosters these desirable<br />\nends. That such policy has<br />\nundesirable consequences in most<br />\nother areas is both a drastically<br />\nshortsighted and seriously<br />\nmistaken reason for condemning<br />\nit in this one. I sincerely hope that<br />\nthe Student Council revokes its<br />\nearlier decision and quickly grants<br />\nformal recognition to the BSU.<br />\nStephen H. Levy<br />\nGraduate Student<br />\nSC VIEWS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFn light of the recent<br />\ncontroversial decision by the<br />\nStudent Council concerning the<br />\nauthorization of the Black<br />\nStudents Organization, I feel it<br />\nnecessary that a representative<br />\nstate his personal views and<br />\nconvictions upon which he<br />\ndecided his vote.<br />\nBlack Students<br />\nThe<br />\nOrganization approached the<br />\nStudent Council with their<br />\nconstitution for authorization.<br />\nArticle 4 of this document stated<br />\nthat membership in the<br />\norganization would be open \"to<br />\nall black students at Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" This clause implied a<br />\ndiscriminatory policy. The<br />\nstudents representing this<br />\norganization removed any<br />\nconfusion on the issue by stating<br />\nthat Article 4 did, indeed,<br />\nconstitute a restrictive clause.<br />\nThe question before the<br />\nCouncil was the following: Should<br />\nthe Student Council authorize the<br />\nBlack Students Organization? The<br />\nmotion was defeated on the basis<br />\nof the objection to Article 4. The<br />\narguments for passage focused<br />\naround the appeal for an<br />\nexception to the \"rule.\" This<br />\nbasic and essential rule at Johns<br />\nHopkins is that no organization<br />\nrestricting its membership on the<br />\nbasis of race, creed, religion, or<br />\nnational origin can exist on the<br />\nHopkins Campus.<br />\nI feel that no exception can be<br />\nmade that contradicts this<br />\nessential principle.

Representative<br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI wish to point out certain<br />\nerrors in the article concerning my<br />\nresearch which appeared in the<br />\nOctober 18, 1968 copy of the<br />\nNews-Letter. Following initial<br />\nsupport by the National Institutes<br />\nof Health, under grant No. RG<br />\n3752, studies on allergy in these<br />\nlaboratories were supported for<br />\none year by a contract with the<br />\nArmy Chemical Corps at<br />\nEdgewood,<br />\nNo. DA<br />\n18-405-CML-606 At the end of<br />\n<br />\nthat time, renewal was made in<br />\nthe form of a grant instead of a<br />\nco tract. The grant was numbered<br />\nDA-CM L-18-108-61-G-15, also<br />\nfrom the Army Chemical Corps a<br />\nEdgewood. The two reprints of<br />\npapers which were given to the<br />\nNews-Letter represented work<br />\ninitiated under the Edgewood<br />\ncontract. Since these and the<br />\nresearch of a later paper published<br />\nin the Annals of the New York<br />\nAcademy of Sciences were mainly<br />\nperformed under the contract, the<br />\nlater grant number referred to in<br />\nthe News-Letter was not used in<br />\nthe acknowledgement. Either<br />\nnumber could have been used<br />\nwith equal propriety. Neither of<br />\nthese financial aids originated at<br />\nFort Detrick.<br />\nTo clarify matters further,<br />\nneither of the research projects<br />\nreferred to above was classified at<br />\nany time. Although there were<br />\nprofessional research persons<br />\nemployed under both, a<br />\nsubstantial portion of the work<br />\nwas carried out with the assistance<br />\nof undergraduate students who<br />\nwere enabled in this manner to<br />\nstudy some of the phenomena of<br />\nallergy at first hand. At no time<br />\nwas any of the material under<br />\nthese financial aids concealed<br />\nfrom the undergraduate students<br />\nworking on them, since the<br />\nobjective of the work was to<br />\nsecure informed participation on<br />\nthe part of these students. Some<br />\nof the students have since<br />\nundertaken professional careers in e<br />\nthe medical aspects of allergy as a<br />\nresult of their work under these<br />\nfinancial aids. Far from being a<br />\nsinister undertaking, as the<br />\nNews-Letter has attempted to<br />\nortra them the have served a<br />\n<br />\nvery real educational purpose.<br />\nAt the time of the interview by<br />\ntwo News- Letter reporters<br />\nreferred to in the article, it was<br />\npointed out to them that earlier<br />\narticles in the -News-Letter had<br />\nalso contained errors of fact<br />\nwhich could have been prevented<br />\nby a check with me as to their<br />\naccuracy. It was presumed at that<br />\ntime that such errors would not<br />\noccur in the future. It is,<br />\ntherefore, regrettable that the<br />\nNews-Letter has once again chosen<br />\nto print information which was<br />\nnot checked for accuracy.<br />\nAlsoph H.

In order to deduce<br />\nthis, one must analyze what<br />\n\"Liberal Arts\" means. Liberal<br />\nsimply means \"free from<br />\nnarrowness, art-a system of rules<br />\nand established methods to<br />\nfacilitate the performance of<br />\ncertain actions. Therefore,<br />\n\"R.O.T.C.\" would certainly be an<br />\nappropriate subject to be offered<br />\nat such an institution. Since<br />\n\"R.O.T.C.\" is offered on a<br />\nvoluntary basis, and since the<br />\nnumber of cadets enrolled in this<br />\nprogram indicates interest, I feel<br />\nit would be tyrannical for anyone<br />\nto try and take this opportunity<br />\naway from them.<br />\nFurthermore, I feel that Mr.<br />\nSakowich's article failed to give a<br />\n<br />\nFACTS SOUGHT<br />\nFACTS SOUGHT ON CHICAGO<br />\n<br />\nCONVENTION VIOLENCE<br />\nThe National Commission on Causes and Prevention of Violence, which was formed after<br />\nthe assassinations of Robert F.

Klima<br />\nROTC REBUTTAL<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe October 18th issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter presented articles and<br />\nan editorial which questioned the<br />\nUniversity's relationship to the<br />\nROTC program and further<br />\nsought to examine various aspects<br />\nof the program. With an imposing<br />\ncollection of \"facts,\" the<br />\nNews-Letter's writers attempted<br />\nto demonstrate, in effect, that the<br />\nROTC program is not compatable<br />\nwith modern liberal thought (as<br />\nexpressed week after week in the<br />\nNews-Letter) and therefore is<br />\ndetrimental to the campus<br />\ncommunity. In brief, the<br />\nNews-Letter has challenged the<br />\nright of ROTC to exist on campus<br />\nand for interested students to<br />\nhave access to such a program.<br />\nA point by point refutation<br />\nand correction of the \"facts\" in<br />\nthe News-Letter's articles would<br />\ntake up far more room than the<br />\noriginals: we must leave it to the<br />\ndicerning reader to use his<br />\nintelligence in interpreting the<br />\nNews-Letter's writings. In essence,<br />\nhowever, the conclusion that the<br />\narticles are mostly a collection of<br />\nhalf- truths and distortions is<br />\nvalid. The few accurate facts<br />\nquoted are those which serve the<br />\npurposes of the writers and which<br />\ngive their work an aura of<br />\nauthenticity and legitimacy.<br />\nSeveral particular items in the<br />\nNews-Letter's verbal barrage are<br />\nso noxious that some comment is<br />\nrequired. The first is Mr.<br />\nSakowich's \"woeful Rotsy Tale.\"<br />\nThis Tale would be a delightful<br />\npiece of fantasy written in an<br />\namusing style were it not that it is<br />\npresented as a factual narrative.<br />\nWhen the Tale is stripped of its<br />\ninnuendoes and clever phrases, the<br />\nbasic issue appears. Because the<br />\ngovernment cancelled his ROTC<br />\nscholarship, Mr. Sakowich<br />\napparently finds it necessary to<br />\n\"grind an axe\" with ROTC, and<br />\nthe News-Letter permits itself to<br />\nbe used as a forum for this sort of<br />\nvindictiveness. What Mr. Sakowich<br />\ndoes not tell us is that his record<br />\nin ROTC was so dismally poor<br />\nthat if it were to be printed, it<br />\nwould prove a source of actute<br />\nembarrassment to both Mr.<br />\nSakowich and the News-Letter. It<br />\nis therefore suprising that the<br />\nNews-Letter and Mr. Sakowich<br />\nconsider themselves qualified to<br />\nbecome the judges and critics of<br />\nthe ROTC program.<br />\nAnother of the particularly<br />\nnoxious points concerns what the<br />\nNews-Letter called \"a<br />\nself-imposed inequality,\"<br />\nparticularly relating to enrollment<br />\n<br />\nand matriculation. ROTC is not<br />\nreally unique in this respect when,<br />\nin fact, most of the major<br />\ndepartments have established their<br />\nown standards of matriculation<br />\nand course pre-requisites. Since<br />\nROTC is completely voluntary,<br />\nthese are accepted by the<br />\nparticipating student as he would<br />\naccept the pre-requisites and<br />\nrequirements in other courses and<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nWe further challenge the<br />\ninvestigation committee suggested<br />\nby the News-Letter's editorial.<br />\nThe ROTC program does not<br />\ninterfere with free inquiry, with<br />\nthe pursuit of knowledge, nor<br />\nwith any other manifestation<br />\nwhich are to be expected in a<br />\nUniversity atmosphere. ROTC<br />\ndoes not in any way affect the<br />\nstudent who does not choose to<br />\nparticipate in the program. It is of<br />\ngreat benefit to that student who<br />\nis interested in the objectives of<br />\nROTC. Consequently, non-cadets<br />\nhave no right to interfere in a<br />\nprogram in which they have, bY<br />\nchoice, no role and which does<br />\nthem no ill. Any critiquing should<br />\nbe done by cadets, Army<br />\ninstructors, and others specificallY<br />\ninterested in the betterment of<br />\nthe ROTC program. The small<br />\namount of credit previously<br />\nawarded for ROTC participation<br />\n(approximately 1 hour of credit<br />\nfor three hours of attendance) Is<br />\nequal to the credit given to the<br />\nlaboratores in the basic sciences.<br />\nYet some of these laboratories,<br />\nfrequently taught by graduate<br />\ninstructors with little interest in<br />\nwhat they are teaching, fall below<br />\nthe caliber of many courses<br />\noffered at Hopkins.<br />\nIt is, we suppose, to be<br />\nexpected that such articles and<br />\neditorials will appear in a<br />\n\"newspaper\" such as the<br />\nNews-Letter. We can only suggest<br />\nthat the News-Letter put its own<br />\nhouse in order before criticizing<br />\nothers who have far less injurious<br />\neffects on the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAlan J.

This was<br />\na reference to his small stature as well as to the<br />\npigmentation of his skin.<br />\nMyth and reality clashed often in J. Kamere's short life.<br />\nThe man who inspired Major Ernesto Che Guevara, and<br />\nwho tutored Malcolm X was also a man of very human<br />\nemotions and impulses as reflected in his famour one-line<br />\nverses. The one-line verse, which J. Kasmere perfected as<br />\nwell as invented, crystalized his radical politics in the<br />\ndescription of the very personal struggle that goes on in the<br />\nmodern African mind.<br />\n\"Green, green, green....Green\" one of his highly regarded<br />\none-liners expresses the pride of African nationalism as well<br />\nas evoking the prominent color of the surrounding<br />\nlandscape in his beloved Urundi.<br />\nJ. Kasmere, The Black Dwarf, was born in 1947 in<br />\nUrundi, a British pocket colony that was not to see Uhura<br />\nuntil 10 years later. Kasmere's family was an unexceptional<br />\nIS<br />\nmember of the Bantu tribe in the jungles of Urundi.<br />\nin<br />\nofficial<br />\nfather, as far as can be ascertained, was a minor<br />\nthe traditional phallic festival held on the eve of tribal<br />\nmarriages. Young Kasmere was exposed in this way to the<br />\nrituals of African life, an experience that would later give<br />\nhim a foundation for his unique revolutionary thinking.<br />\nKasmere's first interest in colonial politics arose during<br />\nhe Mau-Mau nationslist movement in neighboring KenYa'<br />\nwhen a detachment of British soldiers massacred all the fliSt<br />\nborn male children in Kasmere's small village.<br />\nA British colonel was perversely impressed with,<br />\nKasmere's poetry written to eulogize the incident (\"I crY,i<br />\ncry\"), that the young boy was recommended for mission<br />\nschool. At the Urundi Territorial Jesuit School Kasmere<br />\nshowed a keen native intelligence that so often suprises<br />\nwhite people.<br />\nIt was in his later years at the Catholic school that he<br />\norganized the clandestine Black Death organization. Tile<br />\nultra-nationalist revolutionary group was formed in the,<br />\nclassic three-man cell manner and advocated the violen`<br />\ndeath of all white people in Africa.<br />\nKasmere's Black Death was discovered by the priests at<br />\nthe school, who were so impressed with his industriousness,<br />\nthat they recommended he go to England and study al<br />\nSandhurst. In the seed is the germ of destruction, Kasinere<br />\nsaid at the time.<br />\nIt was at Sandhurst that J. Kasmere, by now known as.t<br />\n0<br />\nthe \"Black Dwarf\", first developed his doctrine ,<br />\n\"Revolutionary Organic Dialectic\"(ROD). Dissatisfied wit'<br />\nthe standard interpretations of Marx that he had learned la<br />\na summer session at the University of Peping, Kasmete<br />\nbrought out the first important thought on changing th, e<br />\nhuman body as integral part of the world revolution. Tile,<br />\ndoctrine started with the first rule for revolutionairies, tha<br />\nof logistical independence in tactical military situations'<br />\n(\"Mo-bi-li-ty\") wrote the Dwarf in a verse celebrating tile<br />\n\u201e<br />\nROD.<br />\nJ.

The American Centrar<br />\nIntelligence Agency, which wanted to develop a defense<br />\nthe growing threat of ROD, arranged for a grant so tha;<br />\nKasmere could try out his theory in the field.

However, the history of<br />\nthis progress is confusing and few<br />\nstudents or administrators seem to<br />\nknow what's happening now.<br />\nEarly History<br />\nLast February, the Studcnt<br />\nCouncil took a temporary step by<br />\nconsidering a student \"Bill of<br />\n<br />\nRights.\" However, the issue soon<br />\ndied and the Council never issued<br />\nany final report on the matter.<br />\nThe student body showed little<br />\ninterest in the bill of rights.<br />\nIn the meantime, Dr. Gordon<br />\nissued a statement setting forth<br />\nthe administration's policy on the<br />\nstudent's role in University<br />\ndecision -making. The<br />\nannouncement said that<br />\nundergraduates should be allowed<br />\nto participate in the<br />\npolicy-making procedure in all<br />\nmatters that directly concern<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe SC and the Administration<br />\nagreed that the first step in<br />\n<br />\nrecognizing the student's role in<br />\nthe University was to appoint<br />\nundergraduates to the various<br />\npolicy-making committees for the<br />\nHomewood campus. To date,<br />\nundergraduate members are sitting<br />\non the Calendar Committee, the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, the Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs, the Library<br />\nCommittee, the Bookstore<br />\nCommittee and the Homewood<br />\nTraffic and Parking Committee. In<br />\naddition, students have been<br />\nappointed to 2 recently formed ad<br />\nhoc committees which will study<br />\nthe use of facilities on campus and<br />\nthe Athletic Department.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough students now have<br />\nminimum representation on all<br />\nthese committees, many problems<br />\nstill exist and no one is really<br />\nsatisfied with the present<br />\nsituation. One problem is that no<br />\none really seems to know exactly<br />\nhow many policy-making<br />\ncommittees the Homewood<br />\ncampus has, or what status their<br />\nreports and recommendations<br />\nhave. There even seems to be<br />\nsome confusion about the number<br />\nof permanent committees and the<br />\nidentity of their chairmen.<br />\nDr. Bevan, vice-president of the<br />\nUniversity, and Dr. Kimball, dean<br />\n<br />\n\u201e<br />\n<br />\nAn informal survey of zone 18 indicates that given a choice, heads<br />\nprefer to listen to music played on<br />\nKLH equipment.

First, as Dean<br />\nKimball pointed out, some of the<br />\nstudents who are appointed to<br />\ncommittees really don't care<br />\nabout their jobs. Second, as<br />\nalmost any student on campus<br />\nwill testify, the great majority of<br />\nstudent have no idea which of<br />\ntheir fellow students is on any of<br />\nthe committees. Thus, the<br />\ncommittee system provides no<br />\nreal communication between the<br />\nAdministration and the student<br />\nbody and so far it has been a very<br />\nineffective means of student<br />\nparticipation.<br />\nThere are additional difficulties<br />\nwith the present system because it<br />\nexcludes all student voice on the<br />\nAcademic Council and the<br />\nUniversity Planning Committee,<br />\nprobably the 2 most important<br />\npolicy-making bodies on campus.<br />\nThe University has also<br />\nestablished a new system of<br />\ndepartmental planning, but<br />\nnowhere in this system is there<br />\nany opportunity for student<br />\nparticipation.<br />\nPositive Steps<br />\nEarlier this year, the SC<br />\napproved the creation of an<br />\nundergraduate admissions council<br />\nand thereby provided for direct<br />\nstudent participation in a matter<br />\nthat directly concerns<br />\nundergraduate life. In this way,<br />\nthe Council also by-passed the<br />\noften clumsy committee system.<br />\nAt the same time, both the<br />\nAcademic Council and the<br />\nUniversity Planning Committee<br />\nhave announced their intentions<br />\nto hold meetings to consider how<br />\nthey can allow effective student<br />\nparticipation in their operations.<br />\nBoth Drs. Bevan and Kimball<br />\nsaid that the Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates have a greater<br />\nvoice today 'in substantive<br />\npolicy-making tnan most college<br />\nstudents. While this may be true<br />\nin some senses, it seems that the<br />\nrole of the student is still in a very<br />\ntenuous state and no one on<br />\ncampus really seems to know how<br />\nor when the situation will change.<br />\n<br />\n\"Safety belts?

Yet society<br />\ndoes emphasize \"going to school,\"<br />\nand why is this so? For one thing,<br />\ngoing to college keeps a large<br />\nnumber of young people off the<br />\nlabor market for an additional<br />\nfour years. For another, the<br />\nachievement of a college degree in<br />\nfact demonstrates that one has the<br />\ncapacity to put up with four years<br />\nof academic nonsense, an<br />\nimportant piece of information in<br />\nits own right.<br />\nLack of Concern<br />\nThe second question to be<br />\nasked is, \"Are American<br />\nUniversities concerned with<br />\nEducation?\" Clearly no<br />\nresponsible university official<br />\nwould answer negatively for his<br />\nschool. But in point of tired fact<br />\nall major universities are primarily<br />\nresearch facilities where the<br />\nfaculty members for the most part<br />\nrealistically view undergraduate<br />\nteaching as just another<br />\nnon-rewarding chore to which<br />\nthey must routinely attend.<br />\nThe third question one might<br />\nask is, \"Do students value<br />\nEducation?\" Although there will<br />\nalways be a small minority of<br />\nundergraduates on any campus<br />\nwith a genuine committment to<br />\nlearning, the answer to this<br />\nquestion is \"In general, no.\" Most<br />\nyoung Americans follow<br />\nnon-scientific courses of study for<br />\na variety of reasons, few of which<br />\nhave anything to do with<br />\neducation per se. Thus the B.A. is<br />\nseen as a good background for<br />\nbusiness; college is a good place to<br />\nmake \"contacts\"; parental<br />\npressures force many into school;<br />\nthe degree is seen as a social union<br />\nticket; or perhaps the young<br />\nperson simply doesn't know what<br />\nelse to do with himself.<br />\nThe Production<br />\nThe fourth question is, \"Does<br />\nthe process of a liberal education<br />\nproduce open-minded, broadly<br />\neducated citizens?\" In view of the<br />\nnumber of college-educated<br />\nsuburbanites who will, for<br />\nexample, vote for George Wallace,<br />\nthe temptation is to answer this<br />\nquestion flatly no. But for the<br />\nsake of judicious restraint, one,<br />\nshould properly conclude that,<br />\nlike psychotherapy, there is no<br />\nevidence available to answer this<br />\nquestion.

The unions now<br />\nserve themselves instead of the<br />\nworkers and they expand in their<br />\nown self-interest.<br />\nBetrayed<br />\n\"Liberals have been betrayed<br />\nby both the Federal Government<br />\nand Labor,\" Brinkley stated,<br />\n\"because liberalism forgot to free<br />\nitself from a cumbersome<br />\ngovernment.\"<br />\nBrinkley concluded his speech,<br />\nand opened the question-and\u2014<br />\nanswer period, by declaring that a<br />\nlarge number of people are<br />\nturning to the right, while a<br />\nsmaller number of the people are<br />\ngoing to the left, leaving the<br />\nliberals in the middle. He<br />\ncontinued, saying that the next<br />\nadministration, no matter which it<br />\nis, will be conservative, if not<br />\noutright reactionary.<br />\nThe first question directed<br />\ntoward Mr. Brinkley had to do<br />\nwith the actions of the press at<br />\nthe conventions. The lady posing<br />\nthe question asked whether Mr.<br />\nBrinkley felt that the reporters<br />\n\"put words into the mouths of<br />\nthe delegates,\" created rumors,<br />\nand, in general, \"hung around like<br />\nvultures, waiting to pounce on the<br />\nvarious delegates.\"_<br />\n\"Vultures\"<br />\nBrinkley replied that most of<br />\nthe time, leading questions are<br />\noften the only way to get answers,<br />\nthat the only rumor which was<br />\ncirculating during the Democratic<br />\nConvention was not a rumor at<br />\nall, but the honest truth. He<br />\nreferred to the proposed<br />\ncandidacy of Sen. Ted Kennedy<br />\nwhich, said Mr. Brinkley, \"he<br />\n(Sen. Kennedy) would have<br />\naccepted, if and only if he could<br />\navoid a fight with Johnson and<br />\nHumphrey . . . he couldn't, so he<br />\ndidn't.\" Responding to the charge<br />\nthat newsmen \"hung around like<br />\nvultures\" on the convention floor,<br />\nBrinkley retorted that the<br />\nconvention is on the floor, and<br />\nthat the speeches from the<br />\nrostrum are nothing but<br />\n\"pre-packaged, nylon-filtered,<br />\npolitical baloney..\"<br />\nNext, he was asked what he<br />\nfelt ought to be done about the<br />\nmess. \"Reduce it,\" was his<br />\nimmediate answer. He continued,<br />\nsaying that the military system is<br />\nactually a threat to America's<br />\nfreedom, that militarism and<br />\npatriotism have unfortunattely<br />\nbecome synonomous, and that the<br />\npeople don't realize it.<br />\nHe blamed the Pentagon<br />\nbureaucracy, not the men in the<br />\nfield, for this misfortune, adding<br />\nthat the military establishment<br />\neats up 70% of the national<br />\n<br />\nbudget. He emphasized that<br />\ndoesn't advocate the aboliton of<br />\nthe military, but rather a<br />\nreduction in force. \"The public<br />\nmust know the facts,\" he said,<br />\n\"the military doesn't have to be<br />\nthe dominating force in the<br />\ncountry.\"<br />\n\"Outlook Bad\"<br />\nWhen asked about the fate of<br />\nsocial programs under the next<br />\nadministration, Brinkley replied<br />\nthat the \"outlook is bad\" for such<br />\nprograms, and that they may<br />\ndisappear, even if Humphrey gets<br />\nin.<br />\nThe famed commentator was<br />\nasked whether or not he felt that<br />\na Nixon-Muskie administration<br />\nwould pose special problems. He<br />\ncountered by stating that such<br />\nand arrangement is quite<br />\nconceivable, that the two offices<br />\nare separate constitutiond<br />\nentitles, and that there have been<br />\ninstances in the past when the<br />\nPresident and Vice-President were<br />\nof different parties.<br />\nWhen a member of the<br />\naudience asked why conventions<br />\nhaven't been<br />\nabolished<br />\ncompletely, Mr. Brinkley smiled<br />\nand replied that the main reason<br />\nwas simply because nobody<br />\nseemed to come up with a<br />\nreasonable alternative. He<br />\ncommented that conventions are a<br />\nsort of \"fertility rate\" for the<br />\nparties and that they do have a<br />\nconsiderable amount of social<br />\nsignificance.<br />\nConvention Change<br />\nHowever, Brinkley did suggest<br />\nthat the conventions be run in a<br />\nslightly different manner. He<br />\nproposed that at the conventions<br />\neach party nominate several<br />\ncandidates for the presidency<br />\ninstead of one, that there be a<br />\n<br />\nprimary at wnich time the people<br />\ncould decide, by ballot, who<br />\nshould run, and then have the<br />\npeople vote in November for the<br />\ntwo winners of the primary. He<br />\nwent on to say that \"if the people<br />\ndon't have a voice in the system,<br />\nthe system will collapse.\"<br />\n<br />\nBy BRUCE MAJOR<br />\n<br />\nThe Orientation Committee<br />\npresented the third of five lectures<br />\nthat comprise the \"Symposium on<br />\nAggression\" it sponsors Sunday<br />\nnight in Levering Hall.

The Council objects to<br />\nthe BSU policy of extending its<br />\nmembership solely to black<br />\nstudents on the grounds that<br />\nexclusiveness of membership is a<br />\nterrible evil that cannot be<br />\nsanctioned. What is lost sight of<br />\nby such argument are the reasons<br />\nwhy exclusiveness of membership<br />\n- - or, more generally, segregation - is generally considered to be<br />\nmorally wrong. Chief among these<br />\nare that such policy inhibits<br />\nunderstanding between groups<br />\nand consequently breeds mutual<br />\ndistrust; that such policy is<br />\nconducive to the preferential<br />\ntreatment of certain groups to the<br />\ndetriment of others; and that both<br />\ndistrust and preferential treatment<br />\n(inequality) distrust, and mutual<br />\nhatred are morally objectionable,<br />\nsegregation including exclusivity<br />\nof membership is generally<br />\ncondemned because it usually<br />\nfosters them. When, however, a<br />\npolicy<br />\nwhich is normally<br />\nconducive to something morally<br />\nobjectionable is in a given instance<br />\neither not so conducive or, more<br />\nparticularly, conducive to a good<br />\nend, then to persist in regarding<br />\nthe said policy as morally<br />\nobjectionable in this instance not<br />\nonly is gravely mistaken, but also<br />\nis itself morally objectionable.<br />\nUpon a little reflection, it is<br />\nclear that the membership policy<br />\nof the BSU is such an instance.<br />\nFirst of all, it is not conducive to<br />\nany evil end. For will the BSU<br />\nmembership policy foster<br />\ninequality between the various<br />\ncampus groups? The answer is<br />\n\"no\": the BSU asks only the<br />\ntreatment accorded other campus<br />\norganizations. Will the BSU<br />\nmembership policy foster mistrust<br />\nbetween it and other campus<br />\ngroups? Obviously not. On th<br />\ncontrary, it seeks to establish<br />\nmutual understanding and its<br />\nconsequent trust between black<br />\nand white students on campus<br />\nSecondly, and more importantly,<br />\nthis policy promotes various good<br />\nends. As John Guest and others<br />\nhave pointed out, the totally<br />\nblack membership of the<br />\norganization will enable it to<br />\ncreate more effectively in its<br />\nmembers an increased sense of<br />\nblack identity. Needless to say, an<br />\nawareness of, and consequent<br /><br />\npride in, who one is is a good<br />\nthing. Moreover, the presence of a<br />\ndeterminate body of black<br />\nstudents on campus will serve to<br />\ndraw additional black students to<br />\nHopkins with resultant benefit<br />\nboth for the University<br />\ncommunity and for society at<br />\nlarge.<br />\nThe membership policy of BSU<br />\nclearly fosters these desirable<br />\nends. That such policy has<br />\nundesirable consequences in most<br />\nother areas is both a drastically<br />\nshortsighted and seriously<br />\nmistaken reason for condemning<br />\nit in this one. I sincerely hope that<br />\nthe Student Council revokes its<br />\nearlier decision and quickly grants<br />\nformal recognition to the BSU.<br />\nStephen H. Levy<br />\nGraduate Student<br />\nSC VIEWS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFn light of the recent<br />\ncontroversial decision by the<br />\nStudent Council concerning the<br />\nauthorization of the Black<br />\nStudents Organization, I feel it<br />\nnecessary that a representative<br />\nstate his personal views and<br />\nconvictions upon which he<br />\ndecided his vote.<br />\nBlack Students<br />\nThe<br />\nOrganization approached the<br />\nStudent Council with their<br />\nconstitution for authorization.<br />\nArticle 4 of this document stated<br />\nthat membership in the<br />\norganization would be open \"to<br />\nall black students at Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" This clause implied a<br />\ndiscriminatory policy. The<br />\nstudents representing this<br />\norganization removed any<br />\nconfusion on the issue by stating<br />\nthat Article 4 did, indeed,<br />\nconstitute a restrictive clause.<br />\nThe question before the<br />\nCouncil was the following: Should<br />\nthe Student Council authorize the<br />\nBlack Students Organization? The<br />\nmotion was defeated on the basis<br />\nof the objection to Article 4. The<br />\narguments for passage focused<br />\naround the appeal for an<br />\nexception to the \"rule.\" This<br />\nbasic and essential rule at Johns<br />\nHopkins is that no organization<br />\nrestricting its membership on the<br />\nbasis of race, creed, religion, or<br />\nnational origin can exist on the<br />\nHopkins Campus.<br />\nI feel that no exception can be<br />\nmade that contradicts this<br />\nessential principle.

Representative<br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI wish to point out certain<br />\nerrors in the article concerning my<br />\nresearch which appeared in the<br />\nOctober 18, 1968 copy of the<br />\nNews-Letter. Following initial<br />\nsupport by the National Institutes<br />\nof Health, under grant No. RG<br />\n3752, studies on allergy in these<br />\nlaboratories were supported for<br />\none year by a contract with the<br />\nArmy Chemical Corps at<br />\nEdgewood,<br />\nNo. DA<br />\n18-405-CML-606 At the end of<br /><br />\nthat time, renewal was made in<br />\nthe form of a grant instead of a<br />\nco tract. The grant was numbered<br />\nDA-CM L-18-108-61-G-15, also<br />\nfrom the Army Chemical Corps a<br />\nEdgewood. The two reprints of<br />\npapers which were given to the<br />\nNews-Letter represented work<br />\ninitiated under the Edgewood<br />\ncontract. Since these and the<br />\nresearch of a later paper published<br />\nin the Annals of the New York<br />\nAcademy of Sciences were mainly<br />\nperformed under the contract, the<br />\nlater grant number referred to in<br />\nthe News-Letter was not used in<br />\nthe acknowledgement. Either<br />\nnumber could have been used<br />\nwith equal propriety. Neither of<br />\nthese financial aids originated at<br />\nFort Detrick.<br />\nTo clarify matters further,<br />\nneither of the research projects<br />\nreferred to above was classified at<br />\nany time. Although there were<br />\nprofessional research persons<br />\nemployed under both, a<br />\nsubstantial portion of the work<br />\nwas carried out with the assistance<br />\nof undergraduate students who<br />\nwere enabled in this manner to<br />\nstudy some of the phenomena of<br />\nallergy at first hand. At no time<br />\nwas any of the material under<br />\nthese financial aids concealed<br />\nfrom the undergraduate students<br />\nworking on them, since the<br />\nobjective of the work was to<br />\nsecure informed participation on<br />\nthe part of these students. Some<br />\nof the students have since<br />\nundertaken professional careers in e<br />\nthe medical aspects of allergy as a<br />\nresult of their work under these<br />\nfinancial aids. Far from being a<br />\nsinister undertaking, as the<br />\nNews-Letter has attempted to<br />\nortra them the have served a<br /><br />\nvery real educational purpose.<br />\nAt the time of the interview by<br />\ntwo News- Letter reporters<br />\nreferred to in the article, it was<br />\npointed out to them that earlier<br />\narticles in the -News-Letter had<br />\nalso contained errors of fact<br />\nwhich could have been prevented<br />\nby a check with me as to their<br />\naccuracy. It was presumed at that<br />\ntime that such errors would not<br />\noccur in the future. It is,<br />\ntherefore, regrettable that the<br />\nNews-Letter has once again chosen<br />\nto print information which was<br />\nnot checked for accuracy.<br />\nAlsoph H. Corwin<br />\nProfessor of Chemistry<br />\nMORE ON S.<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a result of the \"article\"<br />\nwrit ten by Mr. Sakowich,<br />\nquestion has arisen as to whether<br />\nor not \"R.O.T.C.\" belongs to<br />\nJohns Hopkins University,<br />\nsupposedly a liberal arts<br />\ninstitution. In order to deduce<br />\nthis, one must analyze what<br />\n\"Liberal Arts\" means. Liberal<br />\nsimply means \"free from<br />\nnarrowness, art-a system of rules<br />\nand established methods to<br />\nfacilitate the performance of<br />\ncertain actions. Therefore,<br />\n\"R.O.T.C.\" would certainly be an<br />\nappropriate subject to be offered<br />\nat such an institution. Since<br />\n\"R.O.T.C.\" is offered on a<br />\nvoluntary basis, and since the<br />\nnumber of cadets enrolled in this<br />\nprogram indicates interest, I feel<br />\nit would be tyrannical for anyone<br />\nto try and take this opportunity<br />\naway from them.<br />\nFurthermore, I feel that Mr.<br />\nSakowich's article failed to give a<br /><br />\nFACTS SOUGHT<br />\nFACTS SOUGHT ON CHICAGO<br /><br />\nCONVENTION VIOLENCE<br />\nThe National Commission on Causes and Prevention of Violence, which was formed after<br />\nthe assassinations of Robert F.

This is definitely<br />\nnot the case.<br />\nAs far as the News-Letter is<br />\nconcerned, I feel they should<br />\nrefrain from using daring exposes<br />\nwhich have little or not truth to<br />\nthem, and a great deal of emotion.<br />\nTerry M. Klima<br />\nROTC REBUTTAL<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe October 18th issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter presented articles and<br />\nan editorial which questioned the<br />\nUniversity's relationship to the<br />\nROTC program and further<br />\nsought to examine various aspects<br />\nof the program. With an imposing<br />\ncollection of \"facts,\" the<br />\nNews-Letter's writers attempted<br />\nto demonstrate, in effect, that the<br />\nROTC program is not compatable<br />\nwith modern liberal thought (as<br />\nexpressed week after week in the<br />\nNews-Letter) and therefore is<br />\ndetrimental to the campus<br />\ncommunity. In brief, the<br />\nNews-Letter has challenged the<br />\nright of ROTC to exist on campus<br />\nand for interested students to<br />\nhave access to such a program.<br />\nA point by point refutation<br />\nand correction of the \"facts\" in<br />\nthe News-Letter's articles would<br />\ntake up far more room than the<br />\noriginals: we must leave it to the<br />\ndicerning reader to use his<br />\nintelligence in interpreting the<br />\nNews-Letter's writings. In essence,<br />\nhowever, the conclusion that the<br />\narticles are mostly a collection of<br />\nhalf- truths and distortions is<br />\nvalid. The few accurate facts<br />\nquoted are those which serve the<br />\npurposes of the writers and which<br />\ngive their work an aura of<br />\nauthenticity and legitimacy.<br />\nSeveral particular items in the<br />\nNews-Letter's verbal barrage are<br />\nso noxious that some comment is<br />\nrequired. The first is Mr.<br />\nSakowich's \"woeful Rotsy Tale.\"<br />\nThis Tale would be a delightful<br />\npiece of fantasy written in an<br />\namusing style were it not that it is<br />\npresented as a factual narrative.<br />\nWhen the Tale is stripped of its<br />\ninnuendoes and clever phrases, the<br />\nbasic issue appears. Because the<br />\ngovernment cancelled his ROTC<br />\nscholarship, Mr. Sakowich<br />\napparently finds it necessary to<br />\n\"grind an axe\" with ROTC, and<br />\nthe News-Letter permits itself to<br />\nbe used as a forum for this sort of<br />\nvindictiveness. What Mr. Sakowich<br />\ndoes not tell us is that his record<br />\nin ROTC was so dismally poor<br />\nthat if it were to be printed, it<br />\nwould prove a source of actute<br />\nembarrassment to both Mr.<br />\nSakowich and the News-Letter. It<br />\nis therefore suprising that the<br />\nNews-Letter and Mr. Sakowich<br />\nconsider themselves qualified to<br />\nbecome the judges and critics of<br />\nthe ROTC program.<br />\nAnother of the particularly<br />\nnoxious points concerns what the<br />\nNews-Letter called \"a<br />\nself-imposed inequality,\"<br />\nparticularly relating to enrollment<br /><br />\nand matriculation. ROTC is not<br />\nreally unique in this respect when,<br />\nin fact, most of the major<br />\ndepartments have established their<br />\nown standards of matriculation<br />\nand course pre-requisites. Since<br />\nROTC is completely voluntary,<br />\nthese are accepted by the<br />\nparticipating student as he would<br />\naccept the pre-requisites and<br />\nrequirements in other courses and<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nWe further challenge the<br />\ninvestigation committee suggested<br />\nby the News-Letter's editorial.<br />\nThe ROTC program does not<br />\ninterfere with free inquiry, with<br />\nthe pursuit of knowledge, nor<br />\nwith any other manifestation<br />\nwhich are to be expected in a<br />\nUniversity atmosphere. ROTC<br />\ndoes not in any way affect the<br />\nstudent who does not choose to<br />\nparticipate in the program. It is of<br />\ngreat benefit to that student who<br />\nis interested in the objectives of<br />\nROTC. Consequently, non-cadets<br />\nhave no right to interfere in a<br />\nprogram in which they have, bY<br />\nchoice, no role and which does<br />\nthem no ill. Any critiquing should<br />\nbe done by cadets, Army<br />\ninstructors, and others specificallY<br />\ninterested in the betterment of<br />\nthe ROTC program. The small<br />\namount of credit previously<br />\nawarded for ROTC participation<br />\n(approximately 1 hour of credit<br />\nfor three hours of attendance) Is<br />\nequal to the credit given to the<br />\nlaboratores in the basic sciences.<br />\nYet some of these laboratories,<br />\nfrequently taught by graduate<br />\ninstructors with little interest in<br />\nwhat they are teaching, fall below<br />\nthe caliber of many courses<br />\noffered at Hopkins.<br />\nIt is, we suppose, to be<br />\nexpected that such articles and<br />\neditorials will appear in a<br />\n\"newspaper\" such as the<br />\nNews-Letter. We can only suggest<br />\nthat the News-Letter put its own<br />\nhouse in order before criticizing<br />\nothers who have far less injurious<br />\neffects on the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAlan J.

At the Urundi Territorial Jesuit School Kasmere<br />\nshowed a keen native intelligence that so often suprises<br />\nwhite people.<br />\nIt was in his later years at the Catholic school that he<br />\norganized the clandestine Black Death organization.

To date,<br />\nundergraduate members are sitting<br />\non the Calendar Committee, the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, the Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs, the Library<br />\nCommittee, the Bookstore<br />\nCommittee and the Homewood<br />\nTraffic and Parking Committee.

For one thing,<br />\ngoing to college keeps a large<br />\nnumber of young people off the<br />\nlabor market for an additional<br />\nfour years.

Thus the B.A. is<br />\nseen as a good background for<br />\nbusiness; college is a good place to<br />\nmake \"contacts\"; parental<br />\npressures force many into school;<br />\nthe degree is seen as a social union<br />\nticket; or perhaps the young<br />\nperson simply doesn't know what<br />\nelse to do with himself.<br />\nThe Production<br />\nThe fourth question is, \"Does<br />\nthe process of a liberal education<br />\nproduce open-minded, broadly<br />\neducated citizens?\" In view of the<br />\nnumber of college-educated<br />\nsuburbanites who will, for<br />\nexample, vote for George Wallace,<br />\nthe temptation is to answer this<br />\nquestion flatly no.

The deficit is<br />\nmade up by using corporate taxes<br />\nand by borrowing.<br />\nThe liberal regime has become<br />\nunwieldy primarily because \"66%<br />\nof the revenue which comes from<br />\nthe country's tax payers\" goes to<br />\nthe military monster, and the<br />\npeople can't support the<br />\nmonster.\"<br />\nMr. Brinkley went on to say<br />\nthat despite the \"indecent rate of<br />\ntaxes,\" social institutions such as<br />\nschools, charitable organizations<br />\nand the like, are on the brink of<br />\nwhat he calls \"financial<br />\nstarvation.\"<br />\nLabor has also contributed to<br />\nthe downfall of the liberal<br />\ntradition because today, contrary<br />\nto the \"giddy optimism\" of 30<br />\nyears ago, organized labor has<br />\nbecome arrogant. The unions now<br />\nserve themselves instead of the<br />\nworkers and they expand in their<br />\nown self-interest.<br />\nBetrayed<br />\n\"Liberals have been betrayed<br />\nby both the Federal Government<br />\nand Labor,\" Brinkley stated,<br />\n\"because liberalism forgot to free<br />\nitself from a cumbersome<br />\ngovernment.\"<br />\nBrinkley concluded his speech,<br />\nand opened the question-and\u2014<br />\nanswer period, by declaring that a<br />\nlarge number of people are<br />\nturning to the right, while a<br />\nsmaller number of the people are<br />\ngoing to the left, leaving the<br />\nliberals in the middle. He<br />\ncontinued, saying that the next<br />\nadministration, no matter which it<br />\nis, will be conservative, if not<br />\noutright reactionary.<br />\nThe first question directed<br />\ntoward Mr. Brinkley had to do<br />\nwith the actions of the press at<br />\nthe conventions. The lady posing<br />\nthe question asked whether Mr.<br />\nBrinkley felt that the reporters<br />\n\"put words into the mouths of<br />\nthe delegates,\" created rumors,<br />\nand, in general, \"hung around like<br />\nvultures, waiting to pounce on the<br />\nvarious delegates.\"_<br />\n\"Vultures\"<br />\nBrinkley replied that most of<br />\nthe time, leading questions are<br />\noften the only way to get answers,<br />\nthat the only rumor which was<br />\ncirculating during the Democratic<br />\nConvention was not a rumor at<br />\nall, but the honest truth. He<br />\nreferred to the proposed<br />\ncandidacy of Sen. Ted Kennedy<br />\nwhich, said Mr. Brinkley, \"he<br />\n(Sen. Kennedy) would have<br />\naccepted, if and only if he could<br />\navoid a fight with Johnson and<br />\nHumphrey . . . he couldn't, so he<br />\ndidn't.\" Responding to the charge<br />\nthat newsmen \"hung around like<br />\nvultures\" on the convention floor,<br />\nBrinkley retorted that the<br />\nconvention is on the floor, and<br />\nthat the speeches from the<br />\nrostrum are nothing but<br />\n\"pre-packaged, nylon-filtered,<br />\npolitical baloney..\"<br />\nNext, he was asked what he<br />\nfelt ought to be done about the<br />\nmess. \"Reduce it,\" was his<br />\nimmediate answer. He continued,<br />\nsaying that the military system is<br />\nactually a threat to America's<br />\nfreedom, that militarism and<br />\npatriotism have unfortunattely<br />\nbecome synonomous, and that the<br />\npeople don't realize it.<br />\nHe blamed the Pentagon<br />\nbureaucracy, not the men in the<br />\nfield, for this misfortune, adding<br />\nthat the military establishment<br />\neats up 70% of the national<br /><br />\nbudget. He emphasized that<br />\ndoesn't advocate the aboliton of<br />\nthe military, but rather a<br />\nreduction in force. \"The public<br />\nmust know the facts,\" he said,<br />\n\"the military doesn't have to be<br />\nthe dominating force in the<br />\ncountry.\"<br />\n\"Outlook Bad\"<br />\nWhen asked about the fate of<br />\nsocial programs under the next<br />\nadministration, Brinkley replied<br />\nthat the \"outlook is bad\" for such<br />\nprograms, and that they may<br />\ndisappear, even if Humphrey gets<br />\nin.<br />\nThe famed commentator was<br />\nasked whether or not he felt that<br />\na Nixon-Muskie administration<br />\nwould pose special problems. He<br />\ncountered by stating that such<br />\nand arrangement is quite<br />\nconceivable, that the two offices<br />\nare separate constitutiond<br />\nentitles, and that there have been<br />\ninstances in the past when the<br />\nPresident and Vice-President were<br />\nof different parties.<br />\nWhen a member of the<br />\naudience asked why conventions<br />\nhaven't been<br />\nabolished<br />\ncompletely, Mr. Brinkley smiled<br />\nand replied that the main reason<br />\nwas simply because nobody<br />\nseemed to come up with a<br />\nreasonable alternative. He<br />\ncommented that conventions are a<br />\nsort of \"fertility rate\" for the<br />\nparties and that they do have a<br />\nconsiderable amount of social<br />\nsignificance.<br />\nConvention Change<br />\nHowever, Brinkley did suggest<br />\nthat the conventions be run in a<br />\nslightly different manner. He<br />\nproposed that at the conventions<br />\neach party nominate several<br />\ncandidates for the presidency<br />\ninstead of one, that there be a<br /><br />\nprimary at wnich time the people<br />\ncould decide, by ballot, who<br />\nshould run, and then have the<br />\npeople vote in November for the<br />\ntwo winners of the primary. He<br />\nwent on to say that \"if the people<br />\ndon't have a voice in the system,<br />\nthe system will collapse.\"<br /><br />\nBy BRUCE MAJOR<br /><br />\nThe Orientation Committee<br />\npresented the third of five lectures<br />\nthat comprise the \"Symposium on<br />\nAggression\" it sponsors Sunday<br />\nnight in Levering Hall.
