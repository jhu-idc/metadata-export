The acceptance<br />\nby the student body of the Inaugural Committee's invitation to send<br />\na delegation to march in the inaugural parade gives us the much more<br />\nagreeable duty of saying a few<br />\nwords about what appears to us an<br />\neminently suitable and dignified<br />\nmanner of honoring our most distinguished alumnus.<br />\nTo the cynical and the disillusioned, the idea of marching in a<br />\nparade with waving banners and<br />\nrolling drums may be only ridiculous and absurd; but to those who<br />\ndo not have the misfortune to be<br />\ncynical and disillusioned, the real<br />\nvalue. which it is possible for such<br />\na display to have must be apparent.<br />\nThis value consists in the symbolic<br />\ncharacter of the display. For the<br />\neducated mind, it may not be necessary to have abstract .ideas represented by visible tokens; and there<br />\nmay even be a few to whom symbols<br />\nare only not necessary but not even<br />\nhelpful. But to the great public at<br />\nlarge an idea means little unless it<br />\nhas some visible expression; and<br />\nthere are several ideas which the<br />\nmarching of college delegations in<br />\nGovernor Wilson's inaugural procession will drive home to the public consciousness of this country in<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n<br />\na way such as nothing else could.<br />\nWhat are these ideas?<br />\nFirst, and above all, there is the \"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nreappearance among the educated<br />\nclasses of a determination to have<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \u201cClothes.\"<br />\na hand in politics\u2014not a determinaAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\ntion to seize on the reins of governModels, both in Suits and Overcoats. . .<br />\nas<br />\nment as their just prerogative,<br />\nthey have sometimes seemed desirous<br />\nto do in the past, but merely to assume the simple duties which our<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\nform of government imposes on every<br />\ncitizen in equal measure.

Here again the effect<br />\non the popular mind is directly valuable. It has in the past been believed, and in many cases with only<br />\ntoo much justice, that the influence<br />\nof education is thrown into the<br />\nscale in behalf of special privilege<br />\nand the selfish interests; and it is<br />\nonly by convincing the public of her<br />\nwhole-hearted and disinterested support of the ideal of equal rights for<br />\n\"<br />\nall that education has any hope of attaining the place, which should be<br />\nhers by right, of guide and leader<br />\nin public affairs or, indeed, any just<br />\ntitle to that place.<br />\nTo show one's support of principles by marching in a parade may<br />\nseem foolish and empty, but it is a<br />\nway which is Perfectly plain and inERE Cheapness is a poor recommendation to<br />\ntelligible to the great public whicli<br />\nanything, and especially to Clothing.

The people of'<br />\nFrederick seemed united in their efforts to show their hospitality to<br />\nthe students, so that everyone who<br />\nwent had a royal good time. But<br />\nthere was a more serious side to the<br />\ngathering together. With such<br />\nspeakers as Mr. Murray of India,<br />\nDr. Mylrea of Arabia, Mr. Kelly<br />\nfrom Africa, and Dr. Young and<br />\nDr. Li from China, telling of the<br />\ngreat social and religious needs of<br />\ntheir countries,the great work of our<br />\nmissionaries came with a new aspect<br />\nto everyone present. Dr. Li, who is<br />\na Chinese lady doctor and at present<br />\ntaking graduate work in the medical<br />\ndepartment of our University, was<br />\nespecially interesting as she told of<br />\nher work\u2014over 9,000 treatments ir<br />\nthe first year in her hospital.

This is almost the<br />\nsole subject of conversations at<br />\nWalter's Gallery, Levering Hall, the<br />\nlibrary, Doc Adam's, and all the<br />\nother haunts of the students. Lunch<br />\nhour has repeatedly been given over<br />\nto heated debates on the subject.<br />\nAs yet, no unanimity of opinion<br />\nhas been reached, but a number of<br />\nclever replies have been received by<br />\nthe Contest Editor. The prize for<br />\nthis week has been awarded to the<br />\ncontestant who submitted the following, with the request that the<br />\nname of the author be withheld:<br />\n\"The 'Glee Club Singer' is a composite picture of Hubner Rice in<br />\nHilgartner's dress suit, with Sattler's<br />\nshoulders, Nelson's legs, Carter's<br />\nfob and Short's feet.\"<br />\nSix of the replies named the Hon.<br />\nJulian H. Marshall. Because of<br />\nlack of space they will not all be<br />\nprinted. The following gives a general idea of their nature:<br />\n\"I wish to submit the name of<br />\nMr. Julian Marshall as the original<br />\nof the 'Glee Club Singer.' The likeness was apparent at first glance.\"<br />\nAmong the others who were honored by being named were Messrs.<br />\nJames H. Marston, Jr., Milton H.<br />\nWagner, George M. Gillet, Edmund<br />\nS. Donoho, Robert J. Scovell, J.<br />\nEarle Uhler and Augustus E.Sattler.<br />\nOne contestant suggested that Mr.<br />\nTappan drew the\"Glee Club Singer\"<br />\nfrom his own photograph. We<br />\nhardly think this is probable, although there may be some likeness.<br />\nAs the Contest Editor knows from<br />\nremarks that have been dropped that<br />\nthere are a number of other students<br />\nwho intended to submit replies, it<br />\nhas been decided to continue the<br />\ncontest another week and award another prize.<br />\nVO- 'Although no replies were received from members of the faculty<br />\nlast week, the Contest Editor wishes<br />\nit to be understood that they are<br />\nperfectly eligible to compete. A reply from a member of the faculty<br />\nwill be given due consideration and<br />\nwill be awarded the prize if it shows<br />\nsufficient merit. The .name will be<br />\nwithheld if requested.<br />\nNoTE\u2014Contestants' replies are<br />\nlimited to 25 words. Be careful not<br />\nto exceed this, as several clever replies had to be thrown in the waste<br />\nbasket last week because of failure<br />\nto observe the regulations.<br />\n<br />\nThe lacrosse squad, which has<br />\nbeen practicing regularly now for<br />\nmore than two months, is in unusually good shape for this time of the<br />\nyear. Although an unusually large<br />\nnumber of old men are out, never:<br />\ntheless, many new men are showing<br />\nup so well that last year's men will<br />\nhave to hustle to hold their places.<br />\nThis has been stated several times<br />\nin the daily papers, but no names<br />\nhave been mentioned.<br />\nOn the defence, the regulars who<br />\nare out at the present time are<br />\nSears, who has been playing goal;<br />\nCaptain Huck, who plays all positions from inhome to point; Butts<br />\nSutton, who, rumgr has it, is wavering between baseball and lacrosse;<br />\nNiles, who has his troubles when.<br />\nthe attack starts to do things, and<br />\nEllicott, who, according to accounts.<br />\nmay not be allowed by his family<br />\nto play; George Gillet, who is<br />\nwalking without a cane now, cannot run yet, but he expects to 1):.<br />\nout later in the season. The two<br />\nsubstitutes of last year\u2014Price and<br />\nRichardson\u2014are showing up very<br />\nwell. There are two freshmen,<br />\nalso, who are doing good work in<br />\nclose defence\u2014Primrose and Hasson. Both have played for City<br />\nCollege and, although they are<br />\ngreen, they will make good men in<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe attack has a very promising<br />\nbunch .out, and it should be able<br />\nto work together to build up a<br />\nfirst-rate machine for this year's<br />\nteam. The leader is, of course,<br />\nEddie Hulburt, who is also assistant coach of the team; no praise<br />\nis needed for Hulburt's remarkable<br />\nplaying. Toni Troxall, who played<br />\nouthome last year, is developing<br />\ninto a plucky and agile player; he<br />\ncan shoot a goal from any angle iii<br />\nthe shortest time possible. Johnny<br />\nKnipp, a freshman, is also a good<br />\nman, and although little, he has excellent stickwork. Voshell and<br />\nEverton, who played mid-field last<br />\nyear, are out again, and although<br />\nnot much can be judged of midfield players in the cage, they seem<br />\nto be doing well. Max Paulus is<br />\nback again playing his usual steady<br />\ngame. Hollyday, last year's center,<br />\nhas not, been out so far owing to<br />\npressure of work.<br />\nAmong the younger men, Randall and Lynch are showing up very<br />\nwell, as is Evitt, a freshman.

The acceptance<br />\nby the student body of the Inaugural Committee's invitation to send<br />\na delegation to march in the inaugural parade gives us the much more<br />\nagreeable duty of saying a few<br />\nwords about what appears to us an<br />\neminently suitable and dignified<br />\nmanner of honoring our most distinguished alumnus.<br />\nTo the cynical and the disillusioned, the idea of marching in a<br />\nparade with waving banners and<br />\nrolling drums may be only ridiculous and absurd; but to those who<br />\ndo not have the misfortune to be<br />\ncynical and disillusioned, the real<br />\nvalue. which it is possible for such<br />\na display to have must be apparent.<br />\nThis value consists in the symbolic<br />\ncharacter of the display. For the<br />\neducated mind, it may not be necessary to have abstract .ideas represented by visible tokens; and there<br />\nmay even be a few to whom symbols<br />\nare only not necessary but not even<br />\nhelpful. But to the great public at<br />\nlarge an idea means little unless it<br />\nhas some visible expression; and<br />\nthere are several ideas which the<br />\nmarching of college delegations in<br />\nGovernor Wilson's inaugural procession will drive home to the public consciousness of this country in<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br /><br />\na way such as nothing else could.<br />\nWhat are these ideas?<br />\nFirst, and above all, there is the \"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nreappearance among the educated<br />\nclasses of a determination to have<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \u201cClothes.\"<br />\na hand in politics\u2014not a determinaAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\ntion to seize on the reins of governModels, both in Suits and Overcoats. . .<br />\nas<br />\nment as their just prerogative,<br />\nthey have sometimes seemed desirous<br />\nto do in the past, but merely to assume the simple duties which our<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\nform of government imposes on every<br />\ncitizen in equal measure.

The very<br />\nact of marching in the parade is a<br />\nsort of announcement or proclamation of enlistment for the war under<br />\nthe banner of Democracy\u2014a crude<br />\nsort of proclamation, if you will, but<br />\none which at least cannot be misunderstood. Here again the effect<br />\non the popular mind is directly valuable. It has in the past been believed, and in many cases with only<br />\ntoo much justice, that the influence<br />\nof education is thrown into the<br />\nscale in behalf of special privilege<br />\nand the selfish interests; and it is<br />\nonly by convincing the public of her<br />\nwhole-hearted and disinterested support of the ideal of equal rights for<br />\n\"<br />\nall that education has any hope of attaining the place, which should be<br />\nhers by right, of guide and leader<br />\nin public affairs or, indeed, any just<br />\ntitle to that place.<br />\nTo show one's support of principles by marching in a parade may<br />\nseem foolish and empty, but it is a<br />\nway which is Perfectly plain and inERE Cheapness is a poor recommendation to<br />\ntelligible to the great public whicli<br />\nanything, and especially to Clothing.

The prize for<br />\nthis week has been awarded to the<br />\ncontestant who submitted the following, with the request that the<br />\nname of the author be withheld:<br />\n\"The 'Glee Club Singer' is a composite picture of Hubner Rice in<br />\nHilgartner's dress suit, with Sattler's<br />\nshoulders, Nelson's legs, Carter's<br />\nfob and Short's feet.\"<br />\nSix of the replies named the Hon.<br />\nJulian H. Marshall. Because of<br />\nlack of space they will not all be<br />\nprinted. The following gives a general idea of their nature:<br />\n\"I wish to submit the name of<br />\nMr. Julian Marshall as the original<br />\nof the 'Glee Club Singer.' The likeness was apparent at first glance.\"<br />\nAmong the others who were honored by being named were Messrs.<br />\nJames H. Marston, Jr., Milton H.<br />\nWagner, George M. Gillet, Edmund<br />\nS. Donoho, Robert J. Scovell, J.<br />\nEarle Uhler and Augustus E.Sattler.<br />\nOne contestant suggested that Mr.<br />\nTappan drew the\"Glee Club Singer\"<br />\nfrom his own photograph. We<br />\nhardly think this is probable, although there may be some likeness.<br />\nAs the Contest Editor knows from<br />\nremarks that have been dropped that<br />\nthere are a number of other students<br />\nwho intended to submit replies, it<br />\nhas been decided to continue the<br />\ncontest another week and award another prize.<br />\nVO- 'Although no replies were received from members of the faculty<br />\nlast week, the Contest Editor wishes<br />\nit to be understood that they are<br />\nperfectly eligible to compete. A reply from a member of the faculty<br />\nwill be given due consideration and<br />\nwill be awarded the prize if it shows<br />\nsufficient merit. The .name will be<br />\nwithheld if requested.<br />\nNoTE\u2014Contestants' replies are<br />\nlimited to 25 words. Be careful not<br />\nto exceed this, as several clever replies had to be thrown in the waste<br />\nbasket last week because of failure<br />\nto observe the regulations.<br /><br />\nThe lacrosse squad, which has<br />\nbeen practicing regularly now for<br />\nmore than two months, is in unusually good shape for this time of the<br />\nyear. Although an unusually large<br />\nnumber of old men are out, never:<br />\ntheless, many new men are showing<br />\nup so well that last year's men will<br />\nhave to hustle to hold their places.<br />\nThis has been stated several times<br />\nin the daily papers, but no names<br />\nhave been mentioned.<br />\nOn the defence, the regulars who<br />\nare out at the present time are<br />\nSears, who has been playing goal;<br />\nCaptain Huck, who plays all positions from inhome to point; Butts<br />\nSutton, who, rumgr has it, is wavering between baseball and lacrosse;<br />\nNiles, who has his troubles when.<br />\nthe attack starts to do things, and<br />\nEllicott, who, according to accounts.<br />\nmay not be allowed by his family<br />\nto play; George Gillet, who is<br />\nwalking without a cane now, cannot run yet, but he expects to 1):.<br />\nout later in the season. The two<br />\nsubstitutes of last year\u2014Price and<br />\nRichardson\u2014are showing up very<br />\nwell. There are two freshmen,<br />\nalso, who are doing good work in<br />\nclose defence\u2014Primrose and Hasson. Both have played for City<br />\nCollege and, although they are<br />\ngreen, they will make good men in<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe attack has a very promising<br />\nbunch .out, and it should be able<br />\nto work together to build up a<br />\nfirst-rate machine for this year's<br />\nteam. The leader is, of course,<br />\nEddie Hulburt, who is also assistant coach of the team; no praise<br />\nis needed for Hulburt's remarkable<br />\nplaying. Toni Troxall, who played<br />\nouthome last year, is developing<br />\ninto a plucky and agile player; he<br />\ncan shoot a goal from any angle iii<br />\nthe shortest time possible. Johnny<br />\nKnipp, a freshman, is also a good<br />\nman, and although little, he has excellent stickwork. Voshell and<br />\nEverton, who played mid-field last<br />\nyear, are out again, and although<br />\nnot much can be judged of midfield players in the cage, they seem<br />\nto be doing well. Max Paulus is<br />\nback again playing his usual steady<br />\ngame. Hollyday, last year's center,<br />\nhas not, been out so far owing to<br />\npressure of work.<br />\nAmong the younger men, Randall and Lynch are showing up very<br />\nwell, as is Evitt, a freshman. Other<br />\nmen out for the team are Marshall.<br />\nLauchheimer, Nelson, Poole and<br />\nRaleigh.<br /><br />\nThe Girls Object Again.<br /><br />\nPartial list of patronesses:<br />\n\u2022 Mrs\u2014<br />\nIra Remsen<br />\nB.
