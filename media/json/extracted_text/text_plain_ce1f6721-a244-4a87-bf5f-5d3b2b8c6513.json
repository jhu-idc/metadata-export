The club is viewing the future with uncertainty, our outpost reports, and has decided to disband<br />\nunless a sharp pick-up is immediately effected within<br />\nits ranks. For this reason it has designated tomorrow's<br />\nluncheon meeting as the critical point in the determination of its continued existence. A satisfactory attendance<br />\nwill enable it to persist and perhaps push forward; a<br />\npoor turn-out is to be considered indicative of lack of<br />\nstudent interest and will in all probability suffice for the<br />\ngroup's immediate and voluntary demise.<br />\nWe are interested in the fate of this particular organization because it offers convincing evidence to a theory<br />\nwhich we have long held. This theory concerns those<br />\nstudents who actively scorn and score liberal and radical campus groups even to the point of egg baths, all<br />\nthe while professing their preference and loyalty to the<br />\nstatus quo.<br />\nYet, do they support that club which is peculiarly<br />\nideal for their beliefs\u2014namely, the conservative Relations Club, which is merely an informative discussion<br />\ngroup and takes no definite stand on current questions?<br />\nThey do not, and, by that very token, denote that they<br />\nare not particularly interested or that they know all<br />\nabout it already. The second inference is extremely<br />\nhazardous; the first allows just the least bit of suspicion to creep in concerning their real reason for perpetrating the disgrace of last April.<br />\nThe Relations Club is prepared to give this conservative element a well-grounded basis on which to rest its<br />\npretensions, so that it may counter with packs of facts<br />\nrather than lack of tact to the arguments advanced by<br />\nthose with more radical leanings. This is the purpose<br />\nof its existence, and, as such, we heartily urge a good<br />\nmeasure of support at tomorrow's luncheon.<br />\n<br />\nReligious Martyr--1934 Model<br />\nTHIS Dr. Lynn Harold Hough is certainly a glutton for<br />\npunishment, make no mistake about that!

The club is viewing the future with uncertainty, our outpost reports, and has decided to disband<br />\nunless a sharp pick-up is immediately effected within<br />\nits ranks. For this reason it has designated tomorrow's<br />\nluncheon meeting as the critical point in the determination of its continued existence. A satisfactory attendance<br />\nwill enable it to persist and perhaps push forward; a<br />\npoor turn-out is to be considered indicative of lack of<br />\nstudent interest and will in all probability suffice for the<br />\ngroup's immediate and voluntary demise.<br />\nWe are interested in the fate of this particular organization because it offers convincing evidence to a theory<br />\nwhich we have long held. This theory concerns those<br />\nstudents who actively scorn and score liberal and radical campus groups even to the point of egg baths, all<br />\nthe while professing their preference and loyalty to the<br />\nstatus quo.<br />\nYet, do they support that club which is peculiarly<br />\nideal for their beliefs\u2014namely, the conservative Relations Club, which is merely an informative discussion<br />\ngroup and takes no definite stand on current questions?<br />\nThey do not, and, by that very token, denote that they<br />\nare not particularly interested or that they know all<br />\nabout it already. The second inference is extremely<br />\nhazardous; the first allows just the least bit of suspicion to creep in concerning their real reason for perpetrating the disgrace of last April.<br />\nThe Relations Club is prepared to give this conservative element a well-grounded basis on which to rest its<br />\npretensions, so that it may counter with packs of facts<br />\nrather than lack of tact to the arguments advanced by<br />\nthose with more radical leanings. This is the purpose<br />\nof its existence, and, as such, we heartily urge a good<br />\nmeasure of support at tomorrow's luncheon.<br /><br />\nReligious Martyr--1934 Model<br />\nTHIS Dr. Lynn Harold Hough is certainly a glutton for<br />\npunishment, make no mistake about that! If you question<br />\nthe authority or authenticity of this statement, the<br />\nfollowing explanation should swing you over:<br />\nDr. Hough was one of the guests and principal speakers at the \"Y\" conference held at Eagles Mere last summer. Now Eagles Mere is a beautiful place, conducive<br />\nto practically every conceivable comfort. Dr. Hough<br />\nmust have accepted the invitation to attend firm in the<br />\nconviction that he would lecture ever so occasionally<br />\nbetween hikes and blissful slumber. Or perhaps he contemplated writing another book 'neath the sylvan<br />\nfriendliness of the environs.<br />\nPoor man, little did he reckon with a bunch of inquisitive imps who hailed from the Hopkins and who<br />\nevidently were crusading adherents of Veritas vos liberabit. For from the moment of his arrival to the time<br />\nwhen he tottered from the scene of action a sadder, yet<br />\nwider, clergyman, he was constantly pestered, peppered,<br />\nand finally sequestered by the murderous barrage of<br />\nquestions put to him by these pitiless, insolent scamps.<br />\nThe editor recalls one night in particular when he and<br />\nseveral others inveigled Dr. Hough into their room at<br />\n9.30 p. m. and hammered away until it was mutually<br />\nagreed to interrupt at 2 o'clock in conformity with an<br />\nalleged NRA code for religion!!<br />\nDon't think for a moment, however, that Dr. Hough<br />\nwas revealed to disadvantage in these midsummer nightmares. If we had been unable to gain any satisfaction<br />\nfrom him at the outset, we would have dropped him<br />\nwithout further ado\u2014we're quite independent, as you<br />\nnotice. But the very nature of his replies led us on<br />\never gradually to follow him in his line of religious reasoning. At times we were forced to disagree violently,<br />\nupon other occasions we demurred; yet our impression<br />\nof the man was in no wise lessened by these frequent<br />\nclashes of opposing beliefs.<br />\nAnd so this week he has returned as guest of the<br />\nHopkins Y. M. C. A. upon the occasion of its golden anniversary. He is to speak at tonight's Supper Club and<br />\nwill also address the assembly on Thursday.
