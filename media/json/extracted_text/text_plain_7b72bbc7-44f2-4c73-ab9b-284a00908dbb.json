Today it is apparent that the tide has changed. The<br />\npresent system meets nothing but criticism. Strange as it may seem it<br />\nis the freshman class that is complaining the most. The very ones who<br />\nwere supposedly to benefit from this change are not satisfied. The men<br />\nof the Class of 1933 claim that they do not know one another and<br />\nthat there is no class spirit.<br />\nThe movement was designed to make the freshman feel less out of<br />\nplace in his new surroundings. The result has been the exact opposite.<br />\nWhen regulations were in effect, the new men may have felt inferior<br />\nin the company of the upperclassmen, but they found many others in<br />\na similar position. This year, however, the strange freshmen seemed<br />\n. to themselves inferior to everyone. Not knowing which men were<br />\nmembers of their own class, they felt more out of place than ever.<br />\nThe protestations of certain upperclassmen to the effect that the<br />\nfreshman is not put in his place except by the enforcement of regula'dons is not to be considered so seriously. Only a small minority of<br />\nthe first year men need to be subjected to any such treatment as is<br />\nadvocated. The majority upon arriving at college are anything but<br />\ntoo conceited.<br />\nIn former years the class rush and athletic contests were a bright<br />\nspot in the undergraduate life. In the absence of any regulations these<br />\nwere .naturally dropped. A resumption of such activities would certainly be desirable. In the first place, too small a number of under\u2022 graduates take part in athletics of any sort at the present time. Secondly,<br />\nthe athletic coaches are given the opportunity to find varsity material<br />\nthat otherwise would never be discovered. Lastly, more class spirit is<br />\nmanifested on these occasions than at any other time during the year.<br />\nThe re-establishment of a regulation compelling all freshmen to<br />\nattend football games in the cheering section would be an aid to the<br />\n\u2022 athletic teams. The lack of cheering during the recent football season<br />\nmay be attributed to the eminently unsuccessful team. However, there<br />\nis no explanation for the puny cheering section that was on hand last<br />\nSaturday at the Army lacrosse game. That contest surely should have<br />\nbrought much applause from Hopkins undergraduates. However, the<br />\ncheering was so weak that the attempts were quite comical.<br />\nAnother regrettable feature of this reform is the passing of the old<br />\ncustom of speaking to everyone met on the campus. This tradition<br />\ncreated a friendly spirit that is much to be desired.<br />\nThe question as to what body should enforce freshman regulations<br />\nis rather complicated.. Regulation by the sophomore class is undesirable. The men who have successfully avoided paddling or other<br />\npunishments during their freshman year are invariably the ones who<br />\nmost ardently punish the incoming class. Furthermore the second year<br />\nmen are hardly unpredjudiced judges when holding paddles in their<br />\n\u2022 hands. This method of enforcement should only be adopted as a last<br />\nresource. Regulation by the Student Council would be advisable, but<br />\n\u2022 would require too great an addition of work for the members of that<br />\nbody. A more expedient solution would seem to be the election of a<br />\nspecial committee. Such a committee, consisting of three or four members elected from each of the three upper classes, could give more time<br />\nand effort to\u2022 the enforcement of regulations. Serious offenses could<br />\nbe brought to the attention of the Student Council while lesser misdemeanors could be punished by the committee. The undesirabilities<br />\nof regulation by the sophomore class could not thus exist.<br />\n<br />\nThe University of Maryland is<br />\ngoing to the dogs! In fact the situation is so bad that the office of U.<br />\nof M. dog catcher has been created.<br />\nNominations for the office will be<br />\nconsidered -at the next meeting of<br />\nthe Student Council. The winner<br />\nof this extremely desirable (?) position will be furnished by the university with all necessary equipment, including net and a Ford<br />\ntruck, and a uniform of Maryland<br />\ncolors, if desired. The reason given<br />\nfor the existence of this situation<br />\nwas that the local canines were<br />\ntreated too kindly at the barracks<br />\nand fraternity houses.<br />\nRutgers is the dryest of all the<br />\nuniversities covered by the college<br />\nprohibition poll, conducted by Pierre<br />\ns. du Pont., The Targum announces<br />\nLafayette is wettest, with 80 per<br />\ncent of its students drinking, while<br />\nPrinceton is a close second. Amherst, Assumption, Harvard and<br />\nYale are also well within the stronghold of the wets. The results of a<br />\npoll taken in Barnard College, Columbia University, show that only<br />\n55 of the 312 women questioned<br />\nare in favor of prohibition enforcement.<br />\nThe new uniforms adopted by<br />\nthe government for the R. 0. T. C.<br />\nhave caused a bit of comment in<br />\nthe various college papers. Among<br />\nother things, the lapels of the coats<br />\nwill be faced with blue and soft<br />\noverseas caps will be worn. If this<br />\nkeeps up, the army uniforms will<br />\nbecome more gaudy than those of<br />\nthe navy, if possible.<br />\n<br />\nThe telephone looks ahead<br />\nEven as you are putting through your daily<br />\ntelephone calls, groups of Bell Telephone experts are calculating your telephone needs for<br />\nfive years, ten years,twenty years from now.<br />\nIt is their work to discover from all available facts\u2014not fancies\u2014how each state, city<br />\nand community will probably grow. These<br />\nfacts are reduced to forecast charts, precisely<br />\nas an astronomer plots the course of a comet.<br />\n<br />\nBELL SYSTEM<br />\n<br />\nThe Dutch treat system of dates<br />\nreceived a K. 0. at Rutgers, as a<br />\nresult of a debate on the subject<br />\nheld there last week. The debate<br />\n\"Resolved: That all college dates<br />\nshould be Dutch treats\" was upheld<br />\nby the girls of the University. The<br />\n<br />\nmen took the negative side and won<br />\nby 57-21 decision of the audience.<br />\n<br />\nThus central offices are planned years before they are actually built.

Today it is apparent that the tide has changed. The<br />\npresent system meets nothing but criticism. Strange as it may seem it<br />\nis the freshman class that is complaining the most. The very ones who<br />\nwere supposedly to benefit from this change are not satisfied. The men<br />\nof the Class of 1933 claim that they do not know one another and<br />\nthat there is no class spirit.<br />\nThe movement was designed to make the freshman feel less out of<br />\nplace in his new surroundings. The result has been the exact opposite.<br />\nWhen regulations were in effect, the new men may have felt inferior<br />\nin the company of the upperclassmen, but they found many others in<br />\na similar position. This year, however, the strange freshmen seemed<br />\n. to themselves inferior to everyone. Not knowing which men were<br />\nmembers of their own class, they felt more out of place than ever.<br />\nThe protestations of certain upperclassmen to the effect that the<br />\nfreshman is not put in his place except by the enforcement of regula'dons is not to be considered so seriously. Only a small minority of<br />\nthe first year men need to be subjected to any such treatment as is<br />\nadvocated. The majority upon arriving at college are anything but<br />\ntoo conceited.<br />\nIn former years the class rush and athletic contests were a bright<br />\nspot in the undergraduate life. In the absence of any regulations these<br />\nwere .naturally dropped. A resumption of such activities would certainly be desirable. In the first place, too small a number of under\u2022 graduates take part in athletics of any sort at the present time. Secondly,<br />\nthe athletic coaches are given the opportunity to find varsity material<br />\nthat otherwise would never be discovered. Lastly, more class spirit is<br />\nmanifested on these occasions than at any other time during the year.<br />\nThe re-establishment of a regulation compelling all freshmen to<br />\nattend football games in the cheering section would be an aid to the<br />\n\u2022 athletic teams. The lack of cheering during the recent football season<br />\nmay be attributed to the eminently unsuccessful team. However, there<br />\nis no explanation for the puny cheering section that was on hand last<br />\nSaturday at the Army lacrosse game. That contest surely should have<br />\nbrought much applause from Hopkins undergraduates. However, the<br />\ncheering was so weak that the attempts were quite comical.<br />\nAnother regrettable feature of this reform is the passing of the old<br />\ncustom of speaking to everyone met on the campus. This tradition<br />\ncreated a friendly spirit that is much to be desired.<br />\nThe question as to what body should enforce freshman regulations<br />\nis rather complicated.. Regulation by the sophomore class is undesirable. The men who have successfully avoided paddling or other<br />\npunishments during their freshman year are invariably the ones who<br />\nmost ardently punish the incoming class. Furthermore the second year<br />\nmen are hardly unpredjudiced judges when holding paddles in their<br />\n\u2022 hands. This method of enforcement should only be adopted as a last<br />\nresource. Regulation by the Student Council would be advisable, but<br />\n\u2022 would require too great an addition of work for the members of that<br />\nbody. A more expedient solution would seem to be the election of a<br />\nspecial committee. Such a committee, consisting of three or four members elected from each of the three upper classes, could give more time<br />\nand effort to\u2022 the enforcement of regulations. Serious offenses could<br />\nbe brought to the attention of the Student Council while lesser misdemeanors could be punished by the committee. The undesirabilities<br />\nof regulation by the sophomore class could not thus exist.<br /><br />\nThe University of Maryland is<br />\ngoing to the dogs! In fact the situation is so bad that the office of U.<br />\nof M. dog catcher has been created.<br />\nNominations for the office will be<br />\nconsidered -at the next meeting of<br />\nthe Student Council. The winner<br />\nof this extremely desirable (?) position will be furnished by the university with all necessary equipment, including net and a Ford<br />\ntruck, and a uniform of Maryland<br />\ncolors, if desired. The reason given<br />\nfor the existence of this situation<br />\nwas that the local canines were<br />\ntreated too kindly at the barracks<br />\nand fraternity houses.<br />\nRutgers is the dryest of all the<br />\nuniversities covered by the college<br />\nprohibition poll, conducted by Pierre<br />\ns. du Pont., The Targum announces<br />\nLafayette is wettest, with 80 per<br />\ncent of its students drinking, while<br />\nPrinceton is a close second. Amherst, Assumption, Harvard and<br />\nYale are also well within the stronghold of the wets. The results of a<br />\npoll taken in Barnard College, Columbia University, show that only<br />\n55 of the 312 women questioned<br />\nare in favor of prohibition enforcement.<br />\nThe new uniforms adopted by<br />\nthe government for the R. 0. T. C.<br />\nhave caused a bit of comment in<br />\nthe various college papers. Among<br />\nother things, the lapels of the coats<br />\nwill be faced with blue and soft<br />\noverseas caps will be worn. If this<br />\nkeeps up, the army uniforms will<br />\nbecome more gaudy than those of<br />\nthe navy, if possible.<br /><br />\nThe telephone looks ahead<br />\nEven as you are putting through your daily<br />\ntelephone calls, groups of Bell Telephone experts are calculating your telephone needs for<br />\nfive years, ten years,twenty years from now.<br />\nIt is their work to discover from all available facts\u2014not fancies\u2014how each state, city<br />\nand community will probably grow. These<br />\nfacts are reduced to forecast charts, precisely<br />\nas an astronomer plots the course of a comet.<br /><br />\nBELL SYSTEM<br /><br />\nThe Dutch treat system of dates<br />\nreceived a K. 0. at Rutgers, as a<br />\nresult of a debate on the subject<br />\nheld there last week. The debate<br />\n\"Resolved: That all college dates<br />\nshould be Dutch treats\" was upheld<br />\nby the girls of the University. The<br /><br />\nmen took the negative side and won<br />\nby 57-21 decision of the audience.<br /><br />\nThus central offices are planned years before they are actually built.
