We hope the committee<br />\nthat is working on the question of<br />\nSuch an organization will find it<br />\nfeasible to report at an early occasion some definite method of securing the undoubted advantages the<br />\nplan offers.<br />\nThese advantages are of two<br />\nkinds. First, there is a distinct<br />\nvalue in having a. recognized student organization that can act upon<br />\nimportant administrative matters.<br />\nThe presiding officer is in a position<br />\nto call meetings for ascertaining the<br />\nfeelings of the undergraduates about<br />\nvarious questions that arise, and to<br />\nact, either in person or through an<br />\n,executive committee, as the authorized head of the student body. If<br />\na regular student council is provided for, it can be of service in negotiating with the Dean and the faculty committees in regard to matters<br />\nwhich have been too often settled<br />\nwithout hearing in an adequate way<br />\nwhat the students have to say about<br />\nthenl: The schedule, hazing regulations, banquet rows, and examination rules might all well enough be<br />\ndetermined with an eye to the<br />\nwishes of the student council.<br />\nThe other class of advantages is<br />\nto be gained from the closer relations the new organization would<br />\nbring about between the students<br />\nthemselves. Mass meetings might<br />\nreadily be held at regular intervals,<br />\neven if there were little excuse besides, for the purpose of keeping<br />\nup college spirit and rousing interest<br />\namong the boys. At Virginia, we<br />\nunderstand, this is a regular part<br />\nof student life. It produces fellowship .and sympathy, and develops<br />\noften where least expected the qualities of leadership and inspiration<br />\namong the fellows who are called<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n<br />\nHands Off.<br />\n<br />\nIt is an excellent thing that the 19 E.

They were instructed to<br />\nbe careful and not to strain .their<br />\nthrowing arms in the cold atmosphere of the cage. Dr. Roulston<br />\nhelped Coach Harlan by batting out<br />\ngrounders to the men. Practice<br />\nSaturday began at 1.15 P. M. and<br />\nlasted almost three hours. More<br />\ncandidates were out, especially<br />\nfrom the medical school, including<br />\nsix of last year's 'varsity nine.

It is an everincreasing marvel how Hopkins<br />\nstudents support and take part ill<br />\nso many different kinds of athletic<br />\nsports. All seem to flourish, and<br />\nto deserve to flourish.

We hope the committee<br />\nthat is working on the question of<br />\nSuch an organization will find it<br />\nfeasible to report at an early occasion some definite method of securing the undoubted advantages the<br />\nplan offers.<br />\nThese advantages are of two<br />\nkinds. First, there is a distinct<br />\nvalue in having a. recognized student organization that can act upon<br />\nimportant administrative matters.<br />\nThe presiding officer is in a position<br />\nto call meetings for ascertaining the<br />\nfeelings of the undergraduates about<br />\nvarious questions that arise, and to<br />\nact, either in person or through an<br />\n,executive committee, as the authorized head of the student body. If<br />\na regular student council is provided for, it can be of service in negotiating with the Dean and the faculty committees in regard to matters<br />\nwhich have been too often settled<br />\nwithout hearing in an adequate way<br />\nwhat the students have to say about<br />\nthenl: The schedule, hazing regulations, banquet rows, and examination rules might all well enough be<br />\ndetermined with an eye to the<br />\nwishes of the student council.<br />\nThe other class of advantages is<br />\nto be gained from the closer relations the new organization would<br />\nbring about between the students<br />\nthemselves. Mass meetings might<br />\nreadily be held at regular intervals,<br />\neven if there were little excuse besides, for the purpose of keeping<br />\nup college spirit and rousing interest<br />\namong the boys. At Virginia, we<br />\nunderstand, this is a regular part<br />\nof student life. It produces fellowship .and sympathy, and develops<br />\noften where least expected the qualities of leadership and inspiration<br />\namong the fellows who are called<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br /><br />\nHands Off.<br /><br />\nIt is an excellent thing that the 19 E.

On Wednesday,<br />\nCoach Harlan called the candidates<br />\nout in the cage for a two-hour<br />\npractice, during which the men had<br />\na good deal of fielding and some<br />\nbatting. They were instructed to<br />\nbe careful and not to strain .their<br />\nthrowing arms in the cold atmosphere of the cage. Dr. Roulston<br />\nhelped Coach Harlan by batting out<br />\ngrounders to the men. Practice<br />\nSaturday began at 1.15 P. M. and<br />\nlasted almost three hours. More<br />\ncandidates were out, especially<br />\nfrom the medical school, including<br />\nsix of last year's 'varsity nine. The<br />\nmen had overcome The stiffness resulting from Wednesday's practice,<br />\nand worked more smoothly and<br />\nwith much more spirit.<br />\nThe coach seems satisfied with<br />\nthe first week's work of the team,<br />\nand should things continue in as<br />\ngood order during the winter, the<br />\nteam will be in good condition and<br />\nwill have gotten down the rudiments of training by the time the<br />\nout door work begins.<br />\nBasket-ball seems to have many<br />\nactive backers here. It is an everincreasing marvel how Hopkins<br />\nstudents support and take part ill<br />\nso many different kinds of athletic<br />\nsports. All seem to flourish, and<br />\nto deserve to flourish.
