He noted that such an<br />\nevent is extremely rare, and that<br />\nstudents still had access to other<br />\nparts of the campus.<br />\n\"Most students would<br />\nrecognize that the campaign is<br />\nin their interests,\" he added.<br />\nMuller also said that he did<br />\nnot feel the festivities opening<br />\nthe campaign were too melodramatic or show-bizzy, as<br />\nsome students had said.<br />\n\"If you have been at a<br />\nnumber of these fundraising<br />\nevents (and I don't mean just<br />\n<br />\nHopkins'), some of them can<br />\nbe excruciatingly boring. It was<br />\nour intent to convey the<br />\nmessage as attractively as possible,\" Muller said.<br />\nHe surprisingly added that he<br />\ndid not know in advance that<br />\nmusic was going to be played in<br />\nthe background as he finished<br />\nhis speech. (Music was played<br />\nat increasing volume until<br />\nMuller's voice and the music<br />\nended in a dramatic crescendo<br />\nas he stopped speaking.) He<br />\nsaid that although he was<br />\nunaware this was going to happen, he did not object to it.<br />\nMuller said he believed the<br />\nsingle greatest benefit to<br />\nundergraduates that will accrue<br />\nas a result of the campaign will<br />\nbe \"scholarship assistance.\"<br />\n\"But I would find it hard to<br />\n<br />\nseparate that from continued<br />\naccess to the best faculty and<br />\nfacilities,\" he added. He noted<br />\nthat it is difficult to assess the<br />\nbenefits undergraduates will<br />\nreceive from a five-year campaign, since by the time it concludes they will have long-since<br />\ngraduated. He also said, however, that such a campaign<br />\nassures the continued excellence<br />\nof the University, and that this<br />\nbenefits everyone associated<br />\nwith it.<br />\n\"Everybody who graduates<br />\nfrom Hopkins, and I assume<br />\nmost students currently enrolled will graduate, has a stake in<br />\nthe quality of the institution,<br />\nbecause if Hopkins goes in the<br />\ndumps, people will say,'Jesus,<br />\nyou went to Hopkins,' \" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n<br />\nOn other issues, Muller said:<br />\n<br />\nthe was unaware of the new<br />\nalcohol policy for the campus.<br />\nAsked if he approved of the<br />\npolicy, Muller said, \"What is<br />\nthe new policy?\" Informed of<br />\nthe policy, which allows alcohol<br />\nto be served at a limited number<br />\nof events, Muller said he believed that the Homewood deans<br />\nwanted a \"transition year\"<br />\n(during which alcohol will be<br />\nserved), because a fairly large<br />\npercentage of the student body<br />\nis still of drinking age. \"After<br />\nthat, it is my impression that<br />\nalcohol will not be served,\"<br />\nMuller said.<br />\nthe believed the students who<br />\nContinued on Page 3<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\f2/OCTOBER 5, 1984<br />\n<br />\nAdvising Systems Discussed<br />\nevery Wednesday.<br />\nPrelaw Advisor Julie Jeffreys<br />\nencourages people considering<br />\nthe field of law to become involved in the Hopkins Prelaw<br />\nSociety.

This deficiency is widespread and there is little<br />\nevidence to suggest that the'condition is improving. Every element of the Homewood<br />\ncommunity is suffering from this isolationist<br />\nattitude but there is minimal concern.<br />\nAcademic departments are autonomous at<br />\nHopkins. Indeed, much pride is taken in this<br />\nfor the situation allows for greater academic<br />\nand research freedom. However, very few<br />\ninterdepartmental activities exist here. There<br />\nis no apparent exchange of knowledge or information. This is unfortunate since such<br />\nreciprocation would serve to strengthen individual scholarship.<br />\nWhile some may notice departmental<br />\nsegregation, undergraduates are perhaps<br />\nmore aware of the irritating lack of rapport<br />\nbetween the administration and students.<br />\nNotable examples of this condition include<br />\nthe recent Capital Campaign kick-off and<br />\nthe WJHU incident. Students were generally unaware of the Capital Campaign until<br />\na condescending letter arrived in their<br />\nmailboxes about a week before the event.<br />\nAnd we are still uncertain as to the status<br />\nof the radio station and subsequent student<br />\ninvolvement. In other words, students are,<br />\nas usual, being kept in the dark.<br />\nThe area in which the suppression of<br />\nmeaningful interchange is most striking,<br />\n<br />\nhowever, is that between students. There are<br />\nseveral well-informed undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins with regard to campus affairs.<br />\nMembers of the Student Council and the<br />\nNews-Letter may be included in this group.<br />\nThe average Hopkins student, though, is<br />\nlargely unfamiliar with Homewood activity.<br />\nFor example, few students were aware that<br />\nthe snack bar was moved to the Terrace<br />\nRoom in the dormitories and now has been<br />\nrelocated to the Rathskellar in Levering.<br />\nWhose fault is it that so little is communicated? Perhaps the Council and the<br />\nNews-Letter have been somewhat negligent<br />\nin publicizing relevant information. Yet<br />\nstudents who are genuinely interested in particular aspects of Hopkins can find information with some effort. The bottom line is that<br />\nthere is little, if any, interest in making that<br />\neffort. Such apathy could prove costly\u2014not<br />\nnow perhaps, but in the future graduates will<br />\nfind that they must stay informed to stay<br />\ncompetitive.<br />\nWe all must learn to take advantage of the<br />\nsmall school that Johns Hopkins is.

This stair-<br />\n<br />\nJHU Ethics<br />\n<br />\nThere are, however, a few<br />\nreasonable solutions for the<br />\nsafety problems on this staircase. The first thing that should<br />\nbe done is to remove most of<br />\nthe bushes on the Charles Street<br />\nside of the staircase. This would<br />\ngreatly increase visibility from<br />\nCharles Street, perhaps allowing a student to see a mugger<br />\nhiding on the staircase from the<br />\nstreet. There is no reason to<br />\nkeep these bushes. They are<br />\nunkempt, ill-maintained, and<br />\nthe hiding place and nesting<br />\ngrounds for countless numbers<br />\nof rats.<br />\nMany other solutions to this<br />\nproblem would involve expenses to the University. For<br />\nexample, Harvard University in<br />\nCambridge has a system of<br />\ntelephones with a direct line to<br />\nsecurity. If one of these phones<br />\nis even knocked off the hook,<br />\nsecurity will go to that particular phone. Harvard, like<br />\nHopkins, is an urban school<br />\nwith many of the same problems as Hopkins. Maybe<br />\nHopkins can take a lesson from<br />\nthem.<br />\nColumbia University in New<br />\nYork is another urban university which Hopkins can use as<br />\na security model. There is a big<br />\nfence around Columbia and entrance only through specific access points. This makes , it<br />\nharder for a trespasser to get<br />\nonto campus. If a guard is placed at each one of these access<br />\npoints, unwanted people will<br />\nfind it virtually impossible to<br />\nget onto campus.<br />\nIf none of these things seems<br />\nreasonable, at the very least<br />\nstepped-up foot patrols of campus, particularly the staircase,<br />\nseem in order. Security seems<br />\nlike a ludicrous place to skimp<br />\non expenditures, because to do<br />\nso compromises the safety of<br />\non<br />\ncampus.<br />\neverybody<br />\nSomething must be done so that<br />\nstudents can once again use the<br />\nstaircase, as well as other parts<br />\nof campus, with confidence.<br />\nIt's our campus.

A hopeless situation.<br />\nLife in Proust's fashionable<br />\nsociety is ultimately a denial of<br />\nman's rationality espoused by<br />\nFrench philosophers in the 18th<br />\ncentury. A little over 100 years<br />\nlater and in the same place, we<br />\nsee the deliberate denial of happiness by a perfectly intelligent<br />\nindividual such as Swann, in<br />\nfavor of a detrimental and<br />\nultimately hopeless love.

One example involves Martha Roseman,<br />\nAssistant Dean of Academic<br />\nStudies. One would have to<br />\nsearch far and wide for a more<br />\nprepared,<br />\nappropriately<br />\ndedicated, or competent individual for the position. Dean<br />\nRoseman places great emphasis<br />\non the Office of Advising and<br />\nCounseling, with which each<br />\nHopkins student must come in<br />\ncontact at some point, whether<br />\nit be a matter as simple as having a schedule signed or changing a faculty advisor, grants or<br />\nfellowships, career goals,<br />\nmotivational problems, or<br />\nsomething more involved like<br />\nstudy abroad.<br />\nDean Roseman, by virtue of<br />\na comprehensive education and<br />\nnumerous experiences in varied<br />\nfields, is more than capable of<br />\ndealing with the far-reaching<br />\naspects of her position. She has<br />\na long and impressive history of<br />\naccomplishments; beginning<br />\nwith a multiple major in<br />\ncollege\u2014a B.S. in Business with<br />\na double major in Sociology<br />\nand Psychology. Like many<br />\nstudents today, Dean Roseman<br />\nhad to balance her parents'<br />\nstipulations for a \"practical\"<br />\nmajor while satisfying her own<br />\ninterests. This is the first of<br />\nmany instances where she<br />\ndemonstrated an important<br />\nprinciple in her life: \"Always<br />\n<br />\nWinchester's<br />\n102 Water Street<br />\n<br />\nautomatic punishment, and sidering that there was little or<br />\ndeveloping an individual no socializing when girls first<br />\nacademic program especially matriculated. \"The guys were<br />\nnot sure how to handle it.\"<br />\ncreated for each child.<br />\nRoseman has had her own<br />\ninn<br />\nAs a consultant, Rosema<br />\nl experiences with unpersona<br />\nother<br />\nto<br />\nm<br />\ntroduced the progra<br />\nd male/female ratios.<br />\nbalance<br />\ncounthe<br />\naround<br />\nmajor areas<br />\ntry.

The amount<br />\nof the award is generally awarded to graduate students; a<br />\nstrong project proposal is a<br />\nmust. However, a teaching<br />\nfellowship is offered under this<br />\nscholarship, allowing for<br />\nstudents to teach English for a<br />\nyear in either a French or German school. A major in the<br />\nlanguage is not necessarily<br />\nrequired.<br />\nNational Science Foundation\u2014<br />\nThe NSF offers scholarships in<br />\nthe sciences, some social<br />\nsciences and scholarships for<br />\nminorities, all towards a Ph.D.<br />\nDr. Arlene Wergin also<br />\nhandles three major scholarships through her office in Merryman; The Rhoades Scholarship, The Watson Fellowship<br />\nand the German Academic Exchange Service Award.<br />\nThe Rhodes Scholarship\u2014 This<br />\nis an international scholarship<br />\noffered to graduating seniors<br />\nfrom any field of study. It is<br />\nimportant to note that the<br />\nRhodes Scholar is an outstanding student not only academically, but in every respect. The<br />\naward consists of two years<br />\nstudy at Oxford University,<br />\nEngland. The scholarship is<br />\nawarded regionally in the U.S.;<br />\nthere are 32 winners from the<br />\nU.S. each year. Emphasis is<br />\nplaced on the applicant's personal statement and interview.<br />\nWatson Fellowship\u2014This is a<br />\none time grant of $1000.00 provided by the Thomas J. Watson<br />\nFoundation. Unlike the other<br />\nawards mentioned, this award<br />\n<br />\nis not a research grant, nor does<br />\nit send the recipient to a university for a year. The Watson<br />\nFellowship is a subsidized year<br />\nof travelling, open to<br />\ngraduating seniors. The<br />\nFellowhip encourages students<br />\nto follow up on a particular interest or hobby, and gives the<br />\nstudent a year to pursue that interest. You're required to submit a written project proposal<br />\nand Hopkins is allowed to send<br />\n4 proposals to the foundation<br />\nfor consideration. If you have<br />\na serious interest you would like<br />\nto learn more about, this is the<br />\nideal Fellowship.<br />\n<br />\nMasters degree.

The victory<br />\nupped the booters' record to<br />\n2-3-2.<br />\nJunior Ian Rothrock kicked<br />\nin two of Hopkins' goals as the<br />\nJays came back from a 1-0 halftime deficit to stage an offensive outburst in the second half.<br />\n\"It feels good,\" said<br />\nRothrock, who appeared in the<br />\nstarting lineup for the first time<br />\nin his Hopkins career. \"It's nice<br />\nto play an entire game.\"<br />\nSpartan attackman Jon<br />\nShultz gave his team a 1-0 lead<br />\nfive minutes into the game as he<br />\nblew past the Jay defense and<br />\nkicked the ball into the left corner of the net. York dominated<br />\nplay throughout the first half,<br />\n<br />\nPaul Miller<br />\n<br />\noutshooting Hopkins 8-6.<br />\nCoach William Tierney was '<br />\nvisibly angry at halftime, and<br />\nhe let his players know about it.<br />\n\"I went nuts on them in the<br />\nlockeroom at halftime,\" the<br />\ncoach said. \"We're a young<br />\nteam and we've been patient<br />\ntoo long. I told them it was<br />\nabout time we stopped making<br />\nexcuses and started playing with<br />\nsome heart.<br />\n\"We did that in the second<br />\nhalf.\"<br />\nAfter Tierney finished his<br />\nverbal outburst, the team<br />\nmembers took it upon themselves to play with total intensity in the second half. \"The<br />\ncoach was angry. We were just<br />\nsitting there,\" stated captain<br />\nDavid Plaut. \"We're a real<br />\ngood team, and we know we<br />\nhave a lot of talent. We just<br />\nsaid to ourselves, 'enough of<br />\nthis.\"<br />\nThe halftime events served to<br />\nignite the booters. Five minutes<br />\n.into the second stanza,<br />\nRothrock scored off a feed<br />\nfrom junior David Gallo. After<br />\neluding two defenders,<br />\nRothrock fired a point-blank<br />\nshot at the York goalie. The<br />\ngoalie made the save, but<br />\nRothrock chipped in the rebound from a sharp angle, tying the score at one.<br />\n\"Gallo made a nice pass, and<br />\nthen it was just me and the<br />\ngoalie,\" Rothrock said.<br />\nTierney praised the play of<br />\nboth Gallo and Rothrock. \"Ian<br />\ndid a great job and David<br />\nplayed well\u2014 he always plays<br />\n<br />\nwell,\" he said.<br />\nYork regained the lead with<br />\na goal at 7:59 of the second<br />\nperiod, but Hopkins was able<br />\nto knot the score at two at<br />\n19:10. It was Gallo, again, who<br />\ntriggered the goal as he tipped<br />\na free kick to freshman Grenville Jones. Jones boomed the<br />\nball into the net for his second<br />\ntally of the season.<br />\nThe booters kept heavy<br />\npressure on the Spartan goalie,<br />\nand a minute and a half later,<br />\nRothrock scored his second<br />\ngoal of the contest to give JHU<br />\ntheir first lead of the game.<br />\n\"Our level of play in the second half was a quantum leap<br />\nover the first half. The whole<br />\nweight of the frustrating season<br />\ncame crashing down about our<br />\nheads,\" said Plaut. As promised, \"the floodgates opened.\"<br />\nThe high intensity level of the<br />\noffensive unit enabled the Blue<br />\nJays to outshoot the Spartans<br />\n11-4 in the second half. This<br />\nmarked the first time in 1984<br />\nthat Hopkins has exhibited a<br />\nsustained defense-to-offense<br />\ntransition. \"Until now, we've<br />\njust been a defense, we haven't<br />\nbeen a whole team,\" noted<br />\nRothrock.<br />\nTierney felt that two strategic<br />\nmaneuvers played key roles in<br />\nthe Jay victory. Near the end of<br />\nthe first half, the team switched from a 4-2-2 alignment to<br />\n4-3-3 as halfback Rob Nardino<br />\nmoved up to forward. Nardino<br />\nreturned to the lineup Wednesday after missing two games<br />\nwith a toe injury.<br />\n<br />\nAlex Lim<br />\nJay defenders Kris Nyogi and Sherif Sirageldin control the ball against York.<br />\nAlso, Tierney switched<br />\nRothrock to center-forward<br />\nand moved Ned Offit to a wing<br />\nposition. This made the difference in the game \"because<br />\nRothrock was in the middle and<br />\nhe was able to distribute balls<br />\nto the sides more effectively,\"<br />\naccording to Plaut.<br />\nThe Blue Jays controlled the<br />\nball for most of the second<br />\nhalf, refusing to let up. With<br />\n7:01 left in the game, Plaut converted on a penalty kick, icing<br />\nthe Hopkins victory. Plaut<br />\nturned in his usual solid performance, and was termed \"a fine<br />\ncaptain\" by Tierney.<br />\nThe coach felt the win was<br />\nimportant because it instilled<br />\npoise and confidence in his<br />\nyoung team. \"I think they<br />\n<br />\nfinally know what it feels like<br />\nto work hard and win,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"This game showed them<br />\nthat intensity pays off and that<br />\nintensity is as important as<br />\nskill.<br />\n\"We played with a lot of guts<br />\nout there.\"<br />\n\"It was a must-win game for<br />\nus,\" said Offit. \"Goals are going to start coming in bunches<br />\nif we keep the intensity up.\"<br />\nThe Jays are anxious to continue their power surge this<br />\nweek as they play two road<br />\ngames.

What they saw,<br />\nhowever, was an intra-squad<br />\nscrimmage\u2014a serious, wellplayed, professionally officiated scrimmage\u2014but no intercollegiate match. It seems<br />\nthat the UB team never<br />\nshowed up.<br />\n\"We're really rather mad<br />\nabout the whole thing,\" said<br />\nsenior tri-captain Jill Schmidt,<br />\nwho spoke with me after the<br />\nmatch along with the other captains, senior Helane Blumenthal and junior Ilga Celmins.<br />\n\"The scrimmage helped us<br />\nrelieve some of our aggressions.\" Baltimore, which dropped all varsity sports two years<br />\nago, couldn't manage to get its<br />\nto<br />\neight-player<br />\nteam<br />\nHomewood. Three team<br />\nmembers eventually arrived,<br />\nand they acted as officials when<br />\nthe scrimmage started.<br />\nAccording to Kim McFann<br />\nfrom the Baltimore squad,<br />\n\"Our program is even more<br />\nfledgling than yours,\" referring<br />\nto the Hopkins team's status in<br />\nits second year of existence.<br />\nThis was understandable, but<br />\nhardly a sufficient excuse to<br />\ngive to the squad and Coach<br />\n<br />\nDawn Finnessy, who had shelled out money to pay for the<br />\nreferee. They also had put in<br />\nsome time to set up the net and<br />\nchairs for the team members<br />\nand spectators.<br />\nSo the team had its scrimmage, and for those who stayed<br />\nto watch, it wasn't bad competition. \"We're glad a lot of<br />\npeople showed up,\" said<br />\nBlumenthal. \"We all asked<br />\npeople we knew to come, and<br />\nwe knew that there was a lot of<br />\ninterest around school.\" The<br />\nsquad has only one other<br />\nscheduled home match, next<br />\nThursday against Gallaudet.<br />\nWhat the University of<br />\nBaltimore team would have<br />\n<br />\nCommentary<br />\nseen was a spirited group of<br />\nwomen who enjoy playing the<br />\ngame and are serious about it.<br />\nThe varsity squad of 16 was<br />\nselected from 26 who tried out,<br />\nand Finnessy has practice<br />\nscheduled for almost every day<br />\nof the week. The sport,<br />\nhowever, is not yet on the varsity level at Hopkins, though<br />\nhopes for next year are high.<br />\nLast year's squad was almost<br />\nexperimental; this year things<br />\nare serious. \"We're more competitive than last year, when we<br />\nwere still struggling to get<br />\ntogether as a team,\" said<br />\nSchmidt. They certainly look<br />\nlike a team, as each player has<br />\n<br />\nbought her own jersey and knee<br />\npads to compliment shorts supplied by the athletic department. The court looked very official, although Schmidt<br />\nreminded me that it did not<br />\nmeet NCAA standards.<br />\n\"We've matured as a team,\"<br />\nsaid Blumenthal. \"We're more<br />\nused to tense situations.\" The<br />\nspikers have participated in<br />\nlocal matches and quad meets<br />\nas far away as West Virginia, so<br />\nthe competition has been keen.<br />\nBut competition isn't much fun<br />\nunless some of it is at home.<br />\n\"Our Catholic University<br />\nmatch was a good experience,\"<br />\nsaid Schmidt. \"They had plenty of seats and a supportive<br />\ncrowd, and it really made a difference.\" There weren't enough<br />\nseats on Tuesday, but there was<br />\na small crowd and a lot of<br />\npotential for an exciting<br />\nevening.<br />\nThe captains point to a<br />\nbetter-than-.500 record for the<br />\nseason as one of their concrete<br />\ngoals, and with some more<br />\nwork, that is certainly attainable. One of the main<br />\nreasons for the team's success<br />\nthus far, they say, is the tireless<br />\ncommitment of Coach Finnessy, who has directed it over<br />\nits two-year existence. \"Dawn<br />\nskips lunch and stays late for<br />\nevery practice,\" said Blumenthal. \"She really dedicates<br />\nherself to our team.\"<br />\nFor those who wandered<br />\nover to the athletic center on<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nsaw<br />\nTuesday\u2014and<br />\nundergraduates, graduate<br />\nstudents, and parents\u2014there<br />\nwas an enthusiastic team ready<br />\nto play its first match on its<br />\nown turf. If they were disappointed at what they saw, and<br />\nrightly so, I urge them to wait<br />\nanother week and come back.<br />\nBlumenthal, Celmins, and<br />\n<br />\nSchmidt promise that Gallaudet<br />\nwill show up, so any potential<br />\nfans needn't worry about<br />\nwasting their time.

The Indians took one<br />\npenalty corner to the Jays'<br />\ntwelve, and managed to get off<br />\nonly eight shots to the Jays' sixteen.

He noted that such an<br />\nevent is extremely rare, and that<br />\nstudents still had access to other<br />\nparts of the campus.<br />\n\"Most students would<br />\nrecognize that the campaign is<br />\nin their interests,\" he added.<br />\nMuller also said that he did<br />\nnot feel the festivities opening<br />\nthe campaign were too melodramatic or show-bizzy, as<br />\nsome students had said.<br />\n\"If you have been at a<br />\nnumber of these fundraising<br />\nevents (and I don't mean just<br /><br />\nHopkins'), some of them can<br />\nbe excruciatingly boring. It was<br />\nour intent to convey the<br />\nmessage as attractively as possible,\" Muller said.<br />\nHe surprisingly added that he<br />\ndid not know in advance that<br />\nmusic was going to be played in<br />\nthe background as he finished<br />\nhis speech. (Music was played<br />\nat increasing volume until<br />\nMuller's voice and the music<br />\nended in a dramatic crescendo<br />\nas he stopped speaking.) He<br />\nsaid that although he was<br />\nunaware this was going to happen, he did not object to it.<br />\nMuller said he believed the<br />\nsingle greatest benefit to<br />\nundergraduates that will accrue<br />\nas a result of the campaign will<br />\nbe \"scholarship assistance.\"<br />\n\"But I would find it hard to<br /><br />\nseparate that from continued<br />\naccess to the best faculty and<br />\nfacilities,\" he added. He noted<br />\nthat it is difficult to assess the<br />\nbenefits undergraduates will<br />\nreceive from a five-year campaign, since by the time it concludes they will have long-since<br />\ngraduated. He also said, however, that such a campaign<br />\nassures the continued excellence<br />\nof the University, and that this<br />\nbenefits everyone associated<br />\nwith it.<br />\n\"Everybody who graduates<br />\nfrom Hopkins, and I assume<br />\nmost students currently enrolled will graduate, has a stake in<br />\nthe quality of the institution,<br />\nbecause if Hopkins goes in the<br />\ndumps, people will say,'Jesus,<br />\nyou went to Hopkins,' \" he<br />\ncontinued.<br /><br />\nOn other issues, Muller said:<br /><br />\nthe was unaware of the new<br />\nalcohol policy for the campus.<br />\nAsked if he approved of the<br />\npolicy, Muller said, \"What is<br />\nthe new policy?\" Informed of<br />\nthe policy, which allows alcohol<br />\nto be served at a limited number<br />\nof events, Muller said he believed that the Homewood deans<br />\nwanted a \"transition year\"<br />\n(during which alcohol will be<br />\nserved), because a fairly large<br />\npercentage of the student body<br />\nis still of drinking age. \"After<br />\nthat, it is my impression that<br />\nalcohol will not be served,\"<br />\nMuller said.<br />\nthe believed the students who<br />\nContinued on Page 3<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n2/OCTOBER 5, 1984<br /><br />\nAdvising Systems Discussed<br />\nevery Wednesday.<br />\nPrelaw Advisor Julie Jeffreys<br />\nencourages people considering<br />\nthe field of law to become involved in the Hopkins Prelaw<br />\nSociety.

Reingold gave a talk last Wednesday entitled \"Metro-GoldwynMayer Meets the Atom Bomb\"<br />\nin Gilman Hall.<br />\nThe talk, sponsored by the<br />\nDepartment of History of<br />\nScience, was centered on an<br />\nanalysis af the 1947 MGM film<br />\nentitled \"The Beginning of the<br />\nEnd.\" Reingold agrees with the<br />\nTime magazine review that said<br />\nthe film was a \"historical, artistic and moral flop.\"<br />\nThe film's depiction a the<br />\nManhattan Project was riddled<br />\nwith inaccuracies and \"received strenuous complaints causing major editing and<br />\nreshooting\" before some scientists agreed to give their consent<br />\nto be portrayed, according to<br />\nReingold.

This deficiency is widespread and there is little<br />\nevidence to suggest that the'condition is improving. Every element of the Homewood<br />\ncommunity is suffering from this isolationist<br />\nattitude but there is minimal concern.<br />\nAcademic departments are autonomous at<br />\nHopkins. Indeed, much pride is taken in this<br />\nfor the situation allows for greater academic<br />\nand research freedom. However, very few<br />\ninterdepartmental activities exist here. There<br />\nis no apparent exchange of knowledge or information. This is unfortunate since such<br />\nreciprocation would serve to strengthen individual scholarship.<br />\nWhile some may notice departmental<br />\nsegregation, undergraduates are perhaps<br />\nmore aware of the irritating lack of rapport<br />\nbetween the administration and students.<br />\nNotable examples of this condition include<br />\nthe recent Capital Campaign kick-off and<br />\nthe WJHU incident. Students were generally unaware of the Capital Campaign until<br />\na condescending letter arrived in their<br />\nmailboxes about a week before the event.<br />\nAnd we are still uncertain as to the status<br />\nof the radio station and subsequent student<br />\ninvolvement. In other words, students are,<br />\nas usual, being kept in the dark.<br />\nThe area in which the suppression of<br />\nmeaningful interchange is most striking,<br /><br />\nhowever, is that between students. There are<br />\nseveral well-informed undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins with regard to campus affairs.<br />\nMembers of the Student Council and the<br />\nNews-Letter may be included in this group.<br />\nThe average Hopkins student, though, is<br />\nlargely unfamiliar with Homewood activity.<br />\nFor example, few students were aware that<br />\nthe snack bar was moved to the Terrace<br />\nRoom in the dormitories and now has been<br />\nrelocated to the Rathskellar in Levering.<br />\nWhose fault is it that so little is communicated? Perhaps the Council and the<br />\nNews-Letter have been somewhat negligent<br />\nin publicizing relevant information. Yet<br />\nstudents who are genuinely interested in particular aspects of Hopkins can find information with some effort. The bottom line is that<br />\nthere is little, if any, interest in making that<br />\neffort. Such apathy could prove costly\u2014not<br />\nnow perhaps, but in the future graduates will<br />\nfind that they must stay informed to stay<br />\ncompetitive.<br />\nWe all must learn to take advantage of the<br />\nsmall school that Johns Hopkins is.

The first thing that should<br />\nbe done is to remove most of<br />\nthe bushes on the Charles Street<br />\nside of the staircase. This would<br />\ngreatly increase visibility from<br />\nCharles Street, perhaps allowing a student to see a mugger<br />\nhiding on the staircase from the<br />\nstreet. There is no reason to<br />\nkeep these bushes. They are<br />\nunkempt, ill-maintained, and<br />\nthe hiding place and nesting<br />\ngrounds for countless numbers<br />\nof rats.<br />\nMany other solutions to this<br />\nproblem would involve expenses to the University. For<br />\nexample, Harvard University in<br />\nCambridge has a system of<br />\ntelephones with a direct line to<br />\nsecurity. If one of these phones<br />\nis even knocked off the hook,<br />\nsecurity will go to that particular phone. Harvard, like<br />\nHopkins, is an urban school<br />\nwith many of the same problems as Hopkins. Maybe<br />\nHopkins can take a lesson from<br />\nthem.<br />\nColumbia University in New<br />\nYork is another urban university which Hopkins can use as<br />\na security model. There is a big<br />\nfence around Columbia and entrance only through specific access points. This makes , it<br />\nharder for a trespasser to get<br />\nonto campus. If a guard is placed at each one of these access<br />\npoints, unwanted people will<br />\nfind it virtually impossible to<br />\nget onto campus.<br />\nIf none of these things seems<br />\nreasonable, at the very least<br />\nstepped-up foot patrols of campus, particularly the staircase,<br />\nseem in order.

The more<br />\nSwann loves her the more indifferent Odette becomes. The<br />\nchallenge of breaking through<br />\nhis initial reserve is over. She<br />\nbecomes bored.

A little over 100 years<br />\nlater and in the same place, we<br />\nsee the deliberate denial of happiness by a perfectly intelligent<br />\nindividual such as Swann, in<br />\nfavor of a detrimental and<br />\nultimately hopeless love. We see<br />\ntoo the irrationality of Odette's<br />\ngrowing indifference to Swan's<br />\ngrowing love, and the cruelty<br />\nand shallowness of a French<br />\nsociety that places value on the<br />\nsmart remarks, the bank account and the title.<br />\nProust's book is ultimately a<br />\npsychological study of a dying<br />\nspecies.

One example involves Martha Roseman,<br />\nAssistant Dean of Academic<br />\nStudies. One would have to<br />\nsearch far and wide for a more<br />\nprepared,<br />\nappropriately<br />\ndedicated, or competent individual for the position. Dean<br />\nRoseman places great emphasis<br />\non the Office of Advising and<br />\nCounseling, with which each<br />\nHopkins student must come in<br />\ncontact at some point, whether<br />\nit be a matter as simple as having a schedule signed or changing a faculty advisor, grants or<br />\nfellowships, career goals,<br />\nmotivational problems, or<br />\nsomething more involved like<br />\nstudy abroad.<br />\nDean Roseman, by virtue of<br />\na comprehensive education and<br />\nnumerous experiences in varied<br />\nfields, is more than capable of<br />\ndealing with the far-reaching<br />\naspects of her position. She has<br />\na long and impressive history of<br />\naccomplishments; beginning<br />\nwith a multiple major in<br />\ncollege\u2014a B.S. in Business with<br />\na double major in Sociology<br />\nand Psychology. Like many<br />\nstudents today, Dean Roseman<br />\nhad to balance her parents'<br />\nstipulations for a \"practical\"<br />\nmajor while satisfying her own<br />\ninterests. This is the first of<br />\nmany instances where she<br />\ndemonstrated an important<br />\nprinciple in her life: \"Always<br /><br />\nWinchester's<br />\n102 Water Street<br /><br />\nautomatic punishment, and sidering that there was little or<br />\ndeveloping an individual no socializing when girls first<br />\nacademic program especially matriculated. \"The guys were<br />\nnot sure how to handle it.\"<br />\ncreated for each child.<br />\nRoseman has had her own<br />\ninn<br />\nAs a consultant, Rosema<br />\nl experiences with unpersona<br />\nother<br />\nto<br />\nm<br />\ntroduced the progra<br />\nd male/female ratios.<br />\nbalance<br />\ncounthe<br />\naround<br />\nmajor areas<br />\ntry.

These include:<br />\nThe Truman Scholarship\u2014<br />\nThis is a national scholarship<br />\nopen to college sophomores<br />\nmajoring in any field leading to<br />\na career in government. One<br />\napplicant is chosen from each<br />\nstate to receive the award. The<br />\nscholarship is for $5000 for<br />\nfour years, starting in the<br />\nundergraduate's junior year.<br />\nLast year, a Hopkins student<br />\nreceived a Truman Scholarship.<br />\nThe Lehman Graduate<br />\nFellowship\u2014 This scholarship<br />\nis for graduating seniors who<br />\nplan to attend graduate school<br />\nin New York State, and plan to<br />\nstudy in the social sciences,<br />\npublic affairs or international<br />\naffairs.

The amount<br />\nof the award is generally awarded to graduate students; a<br />\nstrong project proposal is a<br />\nmust. However, a teaching<br />\nfellowship is offered under this<br />\nscholarship, allowing for<br />\nstudents to teach English for a<br />\nyear in either a French or German school. A major in the<br />\nlanguage is not necessarily<br />\nrequired.<br />\nNational Science Foundation\u2014<br />\nThe NSF offers scholarships in<br />\nthe sciences, some social<br />\nsciences and scholarships for<br />\nminorities, all towards a Ph.D.<br />\nDr. Arlene Wergin also<br />\nhandles three major scholarships through her office in Merryman; The Rhoades Scholarship, The Watson Fellowship<br />\nand the German Academic Exchange Service Award.<br />\nThe Rhodes Scholarship\u2014 This<br />\nis an international scholarship<br />\noffered to graduating seniors<br />\nfrom any field of study. It is<br />\nimportant to note that the<br />\nRhodes Scholar is an outstanding student not only academically, but in every respect. The<br />\naward consists of two years<br />\nstudy at Oxford University,<br />\nEngland. The scholarship is<br />\nawarded regionally in the U.S.;<br />\nthere are 32 winners from the<br />\nU.S. each year. Emphasis is<br />\nplaced on the applicant's personal statement and interview.<br />\nWatson Fellowship\u2014This is a<br />\none time grant of $1000.00 provided by the Thomas J.

The Watson<br />\nFellowship is a subsidized year<br />\nof travelling, open to<br />\ngraduating seniors. The<br />\nFellowhip encourages students<br />\nto follow up on a particular interest or hobby, and gives the<br />\nstudent a year to pursue that interest. You're required to submit a written project proposal<br />\nand Hopkins is allowed to send<br />\n4 proposals to the foundation<br />\nfor consideration. If you have<br />\na serious interest you would like<br />\nto learn more about, this is the<br />\nideal Fellowship.<br /><br />\nMasters degree. About 30<br />\nScholarships are given out annually.

The victory<br />\nupped the booters' record to<br />\n2-3-2.<br />\nJunior Ian Rothrock kicked<br />\nin two of Hopkins' goals as the<br />\nJays came back from a 1-0 halftime deficit to stage an offensive outburst in the second half.<br />\n\"It feels good,\" said<br />\nRothrock, who appeared in the<br />\nstarting lineup for the first time<br />\nin his Hopkins career. \"It's nice<br />\nto play an entire game.\"<br />\nSpartan attackman Jon<br />\nShultz gave his team a 1-0 lead<br />\nfive minutes into the game as he<br />\nblew past the Jay defense and<br />\nkicked the ball into the left corner of the net. York dominated<br />\nplay throughout the first half,<br /><br />\nPaul Miller<br /><br />\noutshooting Hopkins 8-6.<br />\nCoach William Tierney was '<br />\nvisibly angry at halftime, and<br />\nhe let his players know about it.<br />\n\"I went nuts on them in the<br />\nlockeroom at halftime,\" the<br />\ncoach said. \"We're a young<br />\nteam and we've been patient<br />\ntoo long. I told them it was<br />\nabout time we stopped making<br />\nexcuses and started playing with<br />\nsome heart.<br />\n\"We did that in the second<br />\nhalf.\"<br />\nAfter Tierney finished his<br />\nverbal outburst, the team<br />\nmembers took it upon themselves to play with total intensity in the second half. \"The<br />\ncoach was angry. We were just<br />\nsitting there,\" stated captain<br />\nDavid Plaut. \"We're a real<br />\ngood team, and we know we<br />\nhave a lot of talent. We just<br />\nsaid to ourselves, 'enough of<br />\nthis.\"<br />\nThe halftime events served to<br />\nignite the booters. Five minutes<br />\n.into the second stanza,<br />\nRothrock scored off a feed<br />\nfrom junior David Gallo. After<br />\neluding two defenders,<br />\nRothrock fired a point-blank<br />\nshot at the York goalie. The<br />\ngoalie made the save, but<br />\nRothrock chipped in the rebound from a sharp angle, tying the score at one.<br />\n\"Gallo made a nice pass, and<br />\nthen it was just me and the<br />\ngoalie,\" Rothrock said.<br />\nTierney praised the play of<br />\nboth Gallo and Rothrock. \"Ian<br />\ndid a great job and David<br />\nplayed well\u2014 he always plays<br /><br />\nwell,\" he said.<br />\nYork regained the lead with<br />\na goal at 7:59 of the second<br />\nperiod, but Hopkins was able<br />\nto knot the score at two at<br />\n19:10. It was Gallo, again, who<br />\ntriggered the goal as he tipped<br />\na free kick to freshman Grenville Jones. Jones boomed the<br />\nball into the net for his second<br />\ntally of the season.<br />\nThe booters kept heavy<br />\npressure on the Spartan goalie,<br />\nand a minute and a half later,<br />\nRothrock scored his second<br />\ngoal of the contest to give JHU<br />\ntheir first lead of the game.<br />\n\"Our level of play in the second half was a quantum leap<br />\nover the first half. The whole<br />\nweight of the frustrating season<br />\ncame crashing down about our<br />\nheads,\" said Plaut. As promised, \"the floodgates opened.\"<br />\nThe high intensity level of the<br />\noffensive unit enabled the Blue<br />\nJays to outshoot the Spartans<br />\n11-4 in the second half. This<br />\nmarked the first time in 1984<br />\nthat Hopkins has exhibited a<br />\nsustained defense-to-offense<br />\ntransition. \"Until now, we've<br />\njust been a defense, we haven't<br />\nbeen a whole team,\" noted<br />\nRothrock.<br />\nTierney felt that two strategic<br />\nmaneuvers played key roles in<br />\nthe Jay victory. Near the end of<br />\nthe first half, the team switched from a 4-2-2 alignment to<br />\n4-3-3 as halfback Rob Nardino<br />\nmoved up to forward. Nardino<br />\nreturned to the lineup Wednesday after missing two games<br />\nwith a toe injury.<br /><br />\nAlex Lim<br />\nJay defenders Kris Nyogi and Sherif Sirageldin control the ball against York.<br />\nAlso, Tierney switched<br />\nRothrock to center-forward<br />\nand moved Ned Offit to a wing<br />\nposition.

What they saw,<br />\nhowever, was an intra-squad<br />\nscrimmage\u2014a serious, wellplayed, professionally officiated scrimmage\u2014but no intercollegiate match. It seems<br />\nthat the UB team never<br />\nshowed up.<br />\n\"We're really rather mad<br />\nabout the whole thing,\" said<br />\nsenior tri-captain Jill Schmidt,<br />\nwho spoke with me after the<br />\nmatch along with the other captains, senior Helane Blumenthal and junior Ilga Celmins.<br />\n\"The scrimmage helped us<br />\nrelieve some of our aggressions.\" Baltimore, which dropped all varsity sports two years<br />\nago, couldn't manage to get its<br />\nto<br />\neight-player<br />\nteam<br />\nHomewood. Three team<br />\nmembers eventually arrived,<br />\nand they acted as officials when<br />\nthe scrimmage started.<br />\nAccording to Kim McFann<br />\nfrom the Baltimore squad,<br />\n\"Our program is even more<br />\nfledgling than yours,\" referring<br />\nto the Hopkins team's status in<br />\nits second year of existence.<br />\nThis was understandable, but<br />\nhardly a sufficient excuse to<br />\ngive to the squad and Coach<br /><br />\nDawn Finnessy, who had shelled out money to pay for the<br />\nreferee. They also had put in<br />\nsome time to set up the net and<br />\nchairs for the team members<br />\nand spectators.<br />\nSo the team had its scrimmage, and for those who stayed<br />\nto watch, it wasn't bad competition. \"We're glad a lot of<br />\npeople showed up,\" said<br />\nBlumenthal. \"We all asked<br />\npeople we knew to come, and<br />\nwe knew that there was a lot of<br />\ninterest around school.\" The<br />\nsquad has only one other<br />\nscheduled home match, next<br />\nThursday against Gallaudet.<br />\nWhat the University of<br />\nBaltimore team would have<br /><br />\nCommentary<br />\nseen was a spirited group of<br />\nwomen who enjoy playing the<br />\ngame and are serious about it.<br />\nThe varsity squad of 16 was<br />\nselected from 26 who tried out,<br />\nand Finnessy has practice<br />\nscheduled for almost every day<br />\nof the week. The sport,<br />\nhowever, is not yet on the varsity level at Hopkins, though<br />\nhopes for next year are high.<br />\nLast year's squad was almost<br />\nexperimental; this year things<br />\nare serious. \"We're more competitive than last year, when we<br />\nwere still struggling to get<br />\ntogether as a team,\" said<br />\nSchmidt. They certainly look<br />\nlike a team, as each player has<br /><br />\nbought her own jersey and knee<br />\npads to compliment shorts supplied by the athletic department. The court looked very official, although Schmidt<br />\nreminded me that it did not<br />\nmeet NCAA standards.<br />\n\"We've matured as a team,\"<br />\nsaid Blumenthal. \"We're more<br />\nused to tense situations.\" The<br />\nspikers have participated in<br />\nlocal matches and quad meets<br />\nas far away as West Virginia, so<br />\nthe competition has been keen.<br />\nBut competition isn't much fun<br />\nunless some of it is at home.<br />\n\"Our Catholic University<br />\nmatch was a good experience,\"<br />\nsaid Schmidt. \"They had plenty of seats and a supportive<br />\ncrowd, and it really made a difference.\" There weren't enough<br />\nseats on Tuesday, but there was<br />\na small crowd and a lot of<br />\npotential for an exciting<br />\nevening.<br />\nThe captains point to a<br />\nbetter-than-.500 record for the<br />\nseason as one of their concrete<br />\ngoals, and with some more<br />\nwork, that is certainly attainable. One of the main<br />\nreasons for the team's success<br />\nthus far, they say, is the tireless<br />\ncommitment of Coach Finnessy, who has directed it over<br />\nits two-year existence. \"Dawn<br />\nskips lunch and stays late for<br />\nevery practice,\" said Blumenthal. \"She really dedicates<br />\nherself to our team.\"<br />\nFor those who wandered<br />\nover to the athletic center on<br /><br />\nI<br />\nsaw<br />\nTuesday\u2014and<br />\nundergraduates, graduate<br />\nstudents, and parents\u2014there<br />\nwas an enthusiastic team ready<br />\nto play its first match on its<br />\nown turf. If they were disappointed at what they saw, and<br />\nrightly so, I urge them to wait<br />\nanother week and come back.<br />\nBlumenthal, Celmins, and<br /><br />\nSchmidt promise that Gallaudet<br />\nwill show up, so any potential<br />\nfans needn't worry about<br />\nwasting their time.
