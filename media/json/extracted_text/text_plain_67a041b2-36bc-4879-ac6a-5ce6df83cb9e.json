However, no matter<br />\nhow excellent these magazines may be, they always have the<br />\nweakness of presenting a one-sided view.<br />\nThe one magazine which presents college in anything like<br />\nadequate<br />\nan<br />\nlight is the Intereollegiate World. The fact that<br />\nit is a Baltimore publication and has Dr. Ames as one of its<br />\nadvisory editors should make it of special interest.<br />\nThe four numbers which have already appeared are sufficient for a pretty correct estimate. We are delighted to find in<br />\nthe Intercollegiate Woild a magazine which sanely and faithfully portrays the best in nearly every phase of college life.<br />\nBesides covering the three main fields of scholarship, athletics,<br />\nand non-athletic activity, the editors have included articles by<br />\ncollege men who are now in the business or professional world<br />\nwhich are especially stimulating and interesting.<br />\nThe Intercollegiate World is truely the college man's magazine, undoubtedly the leader in its field. We sincerely hope \u2022<br />\nthat in the future it will bepme more widely known on the<br />\ncampus.<br />\n<br />\nWELCOME, VIRGINIA!<br />\nIf present preparations are carried out, visiting teams will<br />\nreceive a most cordial greeting when they arrive in Baltimore to<br />\nmatch their prowess with Johns Hopkins.

The Club has arranged<br />\nwith the fraternities to have eight machines, each representing<br />\n4,ne fraternity, to meet the visiting lacrosse men, at - Union<br />\na tion and conduct them to the field for the game.

However, no matter<br />\nhow excellent these magazines may be, they always have the<br />\nweakness of presenting a one-sided view.<br />\nThe one magazine which presents college in anything like<br />\nadequate<br />\nan<br />\nlight is the Intereollegiate World. The fact that<br />\nit is a Baltimore publication and has Dr. Ames as one of its<br />\nadvisory editors should make it of special interest.<br />\nThe four numbers which have already appeared are sufficient for a pretty correct estimate. We are delighted to find in<br />\nthe Intercollegiate Woild a magazine which sanely and faithfully portrays the best in nearly every phase of college life.<br />\nBesides covering the three main fields of scholarship, athletics,<br />\nand non-athletic activity, the editors have included articles by<br />\ncollege men who are now in the business or professional world<br />\nwhich are especially stimulating and interesting.<br />\nThe Intercollegiate World is truely the college man's magazine, undoubtedly the leader in its field.
