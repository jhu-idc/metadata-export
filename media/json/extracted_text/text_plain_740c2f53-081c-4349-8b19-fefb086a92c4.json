The<br />\nI.F.C. has reacted to the imposition of second semester<br />\nrushing by submitting to Dean Shaffer what appears<br />\nto be the sanest and most workable rush schedule in<br />\nyears. A week ago the Booster Club produced a pep<br />\nrally which, while far from Big Ten standards, was a<br />\nmarked success.<br />\nThese signs of life in the oft maligned undergraduate body would seem to prove that all that is required<br />\nto rouse Hopkins from its lamentable lethargy is leadership. Perhaps this is the quality which has been so<br />\ncopiously lacking on the Homewood campus. A realistic<br />\nand vigorous approach on the part of its leaders to the<br />\nproblems presented by life at Hopkins can, as in the<br />\ncase of the pep rally and the rush schedule, yield truly<br />\npositive results. Apparently all that is necessary to lift<br />\nthe Hopkins community from its doldrums is for its<br />\nleaders to act with decision.<br />\nThis is, of necessity, a subjective judgement. But<br />\nit is only by applying such an intangible quality as<br />\nvigor that the equally intangible result of Hopkins Spirit<br />\ncan be achieved.<br />\nWe have made a start. The exploits of the lacrosse<br />\nteam and the action of the I.F.C. have, in their different<br />\nspheres, initiated what could be lasting improvements in<br />\nlife at the Hopkins.

No.<br />\nPhil. Then Dean Dapper is not<br />\nperceived. You do not perceive<br />\nhim now in your senses.<br />\nPhig. No.<br />\nPhil. Then Dean Dapper is unperceived. He lacks the sensible<br />\nqualities. Which is to say, as<br />\nwe agreed before, that he is<br />\nsenseless, or, as we also agreed,<br />\nirrational.<br />\nPhig. Yes, this is surely so.<br />\nPhil. Ergo, Phigam, if Dean<br />\nDapper is insensible and irrational, there is no real danger<br />\nfor your fraternity. If Dean<br />\nDapper is senseless, he does not<br />\nreally exist in the absolute, and<br />\nthis is that for which we were<br />\nsearching. Dean Dapper is not<br />\nreally there.

The<br />\nI.F.C. has reacted to the imposition of second semester<br />\nrushing by submitting to Dean Shaffer what appears<br />\nto be the sanest and most workable rush schedule in<br />\nyears. A week ago the Booster Club produced a pep<br />\nrally which, while far from Big Ten standards, was a<br />\nmarked success.<br />\nThese signs of life in the oft maligned undergraduate body would seem to prove that all that is required<br />\nto rouse Hopkins from its lamentable lethargy is leadership. Perhaps this is the quality which has been so<br />\ncopiously lacking on the Homewood campus. A realistic<br />\nand vigorous approach on the part of its leaders to the<br />\nproblems presented by life at Hopkins can, as in the<br />\ncase of the pep rally and the rush schedule, yield truly<br />\npositive results. Apparently all that is necessary to lift<br />\nthe Hopkins community from its doldrums is for its<br />\nleaders to act with decision.<br />\nThis is, of necessity, a subjective judgement. But<br />\nit is only by applying such an intangible quality as<br />\nvigor that the equally intangible result of Hopkins Spirit<br />\ncan be achieved.<br />\nWe have made a start. The exploits of the lacrosse<br />\nteam and the action of the I.F.C. have, in their different<br />\nspheres, initiated what could be lasting improvements in<br />\nlife at the Hopkins.

And to relate it thus,<br />\nperhaps you will answer my<br />\nquestion. Can you tell me what<br />\nare \"sensible things?\"<br />\nPhig. \"Sensible things\" are<br />\nthose things perceived by sense.<br />\nPhil. Good. And those things<br />\nwhich are not perceived by sense<br />\nwould be non-sensible or insensible?<br />\nPhig. Just so.<br />\nPhil. How would you describe<br />\nthe insensible?<br />\nPhig. The insensible would be<br />\nthat which lacks the sensible<br />\nqualities.<br />\nPhil. Then we might call those<br />\nthings senseless, since they have<br />\nnot rational basis in the senses<br />\nwhich is to say in the mind. May<br />\nwe say this?<br />\nPhig.

No.<br />\nPhil. Then Dean Dapper is not<br />\nperceived. You do not perceive<br />\nhim now in your senses.<br />\nPhig. No.<br />\nPhil. Then Dean Dapper is unperceived. He lacks the sensible<br />\nqualities. Which is to say, as<br />\nwe agreed before, that he is<br />\nsenseless, or, as we also agreed,<br />\nirrational.<br />\nPhig. Yes, this is surely so.<br />\nPhil. Ergo, Phigam, if Dean<br />\nDapper is insensible and irrational, there is no real danger<br />\nfor your fraternity. If Dean<br />\nDapper is senseless, he does not<br />\nreally exist in the absolute, and<br />\nthis is that for which we were<br />\nsearching. Dean Dapper is not<br />\nreally there. Anything he is or<br />\ndoes can be doubted. In the end,<br />\nPhigam, you can cheer up. Have<br />\nI not solved your problem?<br />\nPhig. Yeh.
