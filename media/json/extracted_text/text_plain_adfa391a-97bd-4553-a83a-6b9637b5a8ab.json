Virginia.<br />\nThree yeatits All-Maryland as a<br />\nmidfielder and attackman at Baltimore Poly, Fewster played his<br />\nfirst lacrosse for Hopkins in 1947<br />\nand climaxed a brilliant season by<br />\nbeing named to an All-A_merican<br />\nInidfleld slot.<br />\nThe following year, however,<br />\nthings didn't break so well for<br />\nFewster.

Wilson proved his versatility by nabbing, the 1st-string sec-<br />\n<br />\nnod base position for the Jays and<br />\nwas a capable infielder.<br />\nThis Spring, however, with this<br />\nexperience under his belt, the<br />\ndark-haired hustler returned to<br />\nlacrosse and has tallied five goals<br />\nin the wins over Loyola and Virginia.
