It had<br />\nbroken down, as it had at least<br />\nonce a day for the last month and<br />\na half. Carl Reavis, who managed the buildings under [property<br />\nmanager Betty] Pulling, came out<br />\nand said that they did not<br />\nguarantee elevator service. When<br />\nhe said that, I got really ticked<br />\noff.\"<br />\nSenior Brigid Joyce, who coorganized the petition with<br />\nseniors Anne Marie Hamilton,<br />\nAdam Lowe, and Wiley, all twoyear residents of the Charles, said<br />\nthe situation has \"gotten worse<br />\nevery year. The Charles really<br />\nhas not remained competitive.\"<br />\nNoting that the lobby was attractive and well furnished when<br />\nhe moved in, Wiley said it now<br />\nhas only \"a pullout sofa bed.\" He<br />\nobserved that the building no<br />\nlonger accepts packages, the<br />\nmaintenance crew has repaid turnover, and thefts seem more<br />\nprevalent.<br />\nReavis disagreed with student<br />\nperceptions of poor maintenance.<br />\n\"It has been my impression that<br />\nwe have been addressing<br />\nmaintenance problems in an increasingly efficient fashion,\"he<br />\nsaid. \"Mrs. Pulling said that<br />\nwhen she came on the job in<br />\nJanuary, there were work orders<br />\nbacked up to August. Service<br />\ncalls are now being answered or<br />\nat least inspected within twentyfour hours.\"<br />\nJoe Harper, part of the<br />\nmaintenance crew for the<br />\nbuildings until the end of the summer, countered that maintenance<br />\nhas not been up to par since the<br />\ndeparture of Building Manager<br />\nWendy Blum for the Hopkins<br />\nHouse apartments earlier this<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"The buildings have gone<br />\ndownhill, considerably, \" he<br />\nsaid. Pointing out the necessity<br />\nfor having staff available to run<br />\nthe freight elevators during frequent breakdowns of the regular<br />\nelevator put much strain on the<br />\nstaff, Harper said Pulling \"came<br />\nin here and had us snitching<br />\naround the crowd. It wasn't like<br />\n<br />\nAndrea Kaufman<br />\n<br />\nThe Charles<br />\na job anymore, but more like a little plot.\"<br />\nReavis admitted to the elevator<br />\nproblems. Explaining that the<br />\nbuilding has a service contract for<br />\nthe elevators, he suggested that<br />\nshortcomings in the service contractor's performance have been<br />\nremedied for the most part, but<br />\nthat \"our service contract excludes vandalism. The two times<br />\nthat the Blackstone elevator has<br />\nbeen out lately is because someone has torn the operating<br />\npanels off.\"<br />\nConstant vandalism in the<br />\nBlackstone and the Charles is a<br />\nproblem both management and<br />\nresidents have noted. Reavis said,<br />\n\"It's not a problem with our<br />\nresidents, but rather with our<br />\nresidents' guests.\"<br />\nWiley acknowledged the vandalism problem, saying, \"I'd like<br />\n<br />\nto find out who's doing the vandalism, because it's just making<br />\nit a lot worse for the rest of us.\"<br />\nIn response to complaints by<br />\nresidents as to thefts and<br />\nburglaries in the buildings,<br />\nReavis acknowledged a problem<br />\nwith employees having master<br />\nkeys they should not have had,<br />\nbut said, \"We have inherited a<br />\nsituation [from previous management] but we have been collecting<br />\nevidence and we've been able to<br />\ndiscern a pattern\" in reported<br />\nthefts, \"and we've been trying to<br />\nstraighten it out.\"<br />\nPulling responded to complaints that the buildings would<br />\nno longer accept packages by saying that a United Parcel package<br />\nhad disappeared earlier in the<br />\nyear. As a result of that theft, someone filed a lawsuit. In<br />\nresponse, Pulling said the threat<br />\n<br />\nBent Goro<br />\n<br />\nThe elevator in the Charles apartment building, a prime source of tenant dissatisfaction with the building.<br />\nof losing the buildings' liability<br />\ninsurance prompted her to cancel<br />\nthe service.<br />\nBlum, who did accept packages<br />\nfor residents during her tenure,<br />\ndisagreed with Pulling's portrayal<br />\nof the problem as an insurance<br />\none, saying instead, \"They [the<br />\nnew management] did not want<br />\nthe responsibility. Every other<br />\nbuilding in the neighborhood accepts their residents' packages.\"<br />\nReavis said vandalism is to<br />\nblame for the current appearance<br />\nof the Blackstone's and Charles's<br />\nlobbies. Pointing out that furniture that had been in the<br />\nBlackstone's lobby was stolen,<br />\nReavis said, \"The couch out<br />\nthere [in the Charles's lobby] is<br />\nthe same couch as before, but it<br />\nhas been recovered. The couches<br />\nthat were out there were in bad<br />\nrepair. We decided that one<br />\n<br />\nwould suffice, and given the experience in the Blackstone, we<br />\ndidn't want to refurbish<br />\neverything and have people walk<br />\noff with it.\"<br />\nPulling said management is investing in \"vandalism-resistant<br />\nelevator panels\" in an effort to<br />\nimprove the elevators' reliability.<br />\nWiley disagreed that vandalism<br />\nis the source of all problems, saying, \"They're not really putting<br />\nanything back into the building.<br />\nArchitecturally, it's beautiful, but<br />\nit's like they're [stripping] the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nMrs. Pulling's<br />\nphilosophy since she has taken<br />\nover seems to be that if there's a<br />\nproblem with something, simply<br />\neliminate the service altogether.\"<br />\nHe cited the closing of the mail<br />\nchute as an example.

It noted that the relationships<br />\nbetween administrators, faculty, staff,<br />\nand students were at the heart of the problems of the human climate. It claimed<br />\nan \"artificial separation\" of the community exists, creating an \"elitist and<br />\nexclusive\" hierarchy which made certain members feel like second-class<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nWe are faced today with the unenviable task of assessing the University's<br />\nclimate a full year after its release.<br />\nUnenviable, we say, because it is very<br />\ndifficult to meter an intangible such as<br />\n\"climate\". At this point, we can only<br />\nlook at the quantifiable results. For example, how many of the changes the<br />\nreport called for to improve the climate<br />\nwere actually realized?<br />\nOn a human level, certainly we have<br />\nseen much implementation of recommendations. Many committees have<br />\nbeen formed and offices instituted, most<br />\nnotably that of the Ombudsman, Dr.<br />\nSigmund Suskind. People from all<br />\nwalks of life at Homewood have shown<br />\na sincere desire for change.<br />\nThis desire has carried over into the<br />\nareas that many students are most interested in\u2014amenities such as a student<br />\nunion and improvements in financial<br />\naid, the athletic center, and housing.<br />\nAdministrators pledge to address problems in these specific areas and will<br />\ndetail ways to improve them. We<br />\nunderstand that problems of great<br />\nmagnitude cannot be solved overnight<br />\nand we appreciate that effective pro-<br />\n<br />\ngrams of change require time and<br />\nthought to develop.<br />\nThese programs also require one<br />\nessential ingredient: money. This brings<br />\nus to the crux of the problem\u2014along<br />\nwith the release of the report last year,<br />\nthe University announced a massive<br />\ndeficit in Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe University is in a good position:<br />\nit has not only pinpointed the issues that<br />\nit needs to address but has people with<br />\nenough initiative to resolve them. It is<br />\npainfully obvious, however, that the<br />\ntangible improvements the report calls<br />\nfor can never come about with the<br />\nUniversity's current fiscal situation.<br />\nArts and Sciences is expected, as are<br />\nall divisions of the University, to<br />\noperate with financial autonomy. The<br />\nhistory of the University, and indeed,<br />\nArts and Sciences' current situation prove this assumption fallacious. The division simply cannot attract the level of<br />\nendowments it needs to operate satisfactorily. After all, as President Muller is<br />\nso fond of saying, \"nobody ever died<br />\nof English.\"<br />\nThe University must necessarily be<br />\nrealistic about the pointlessness of its<br />\npolicy. There is no use pretending that<br />\nthe division can generate the funds<br />\nnecessary for its existence, let alone for<br />\nimprovements. We call for the administration to assess budget appropriations for all its divisions. Perhaps it is<br />\nnot such a good idea to stress independence among divisions.<br />\nIf The Johns Hopkins Instituions elect<br />\nto have an undergraduate division, they<br />\nshould shoulder the responsibility of<br />\nfinancing it. As it is now, it is completely unfair to present and future students<br />\nto allow Homewood to snuff itself out.<br />\n<br />\nHousing fraternities<br />\nThe past few years have seen the attempted formation of several fraternities<br />\nat Homewood\u2014some successful, some<br />\nnot. Such attempts require a great deal<br />\nof initiative on the part of their<br />\norganizers, who face several obstacles<br />\nalong their path. Not only must they<br />\ngather together a sufficient number of<br />\ninterested individuals, but they must<br />\nfight bureaucratic channels\u2014those of<br />\nthe Interfraternity Council, their national organizations, and the University.<br />\nHaving surmounted these obstacles,<br />\nthe fledgling fraternity's next logical<br />\nstep is to try to procure a house. After<br />\nall, such is the core of the social<br />\nworkings\u2014the concrete symbol\u2014of the<br />\nfraternity. However, this has proved<br />\nproblematic.<br />\nBaltimore City Laws specifically prohibit establishment of fraternity houses<br />\nin our surrounding communities. There<br />\nis no effective way for Hopkins students<br />\nto protest city ordinances inasmuch as<br />\nwe are not permanent residents of the<br />\narea, even though we comprise a significant portion of the surrounding<br />\n<br />\npopulation.<br />\nWe can understand the communities'<br />\nresistance to frat houses\u2014certainly,<br />\nloud parties are no fun unless you're<br />\nthere. However, there is more to fraternity life than its parties. This weekend's<br />\nPhi Psi 500 is evidence of that.<br />\nThe University seems to feel a need<br />\nfor fraternities as well. The attention<br />\ngiven them, for example, by Special<br />\nAssistant to the Dean of Students Mary<br />\nEllen Porter indicates a recognition on<br />\nits part of the fraternities' positive<br />\npotential force within the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAccordingly, the University should<br />\ngive more support to the frats' efforts<br />\nto secure houses. After all, Hopkins has<br />\nthe power to exert a lot of influence and<br />\ncan act as an advocate for the fraternities' plight.<br />\nThese laws have existed since the mid<br />\n1970's\u2014the University has had over ten<br />\nyears to \"try to determine the best<br />\ncourse\" to remedy the situation. It is<br />\ntime to take action.<br />\n<br />\nIt is the fall of your senior year<br />\nin high school, the year 2001. On<br />\nthe basis of Barron's College<br />\nGuide, you have narrowed your<br />\nlist of potential universities down<br />\nto a number that you can count on<br />\none hand.

There have been<br />\nslight increases every year for a<br />\n\"few years now,\" but they are<br />\n<br />\nconsidering building more oncampus housing to accomodate.<br />\nthe extra students. There are now<br />\n3400 International Relations majors, a new record, and four<br />\npolitical science professors.<br />\nMuller expresses his confidence<br />\nin the shrunken department, saying that Hopkins exposes its<br />\nstudents a little earlier to the real<br />\nworld, but that the pros far<br />\noutweigh the cons in the long run.<br />\nThe video goes on for a while<br />\nlonger, discussing the various<br />\ndepartments and their merits.<br />\nMuller points out that Hopkins<br />\nhas become the first major<br />\nuniversity with more gardeners<br />\nthan faculty members and suggests that they have expanded<br />\ntheir fleet of miniature street<br />\ncleaning machines so that we<br />\nhave a Plant Operations department which is the envy of the<br />\nworld.<br />\nAfter a short while, the<br />\nsecretary comes back in and introduces you to a Blue Key robot,<br />\nwho offers to take you on a tour<br />\nof the campus. As you walk out<br />\nof Garland, the first thing that<br />\nstrikes you is a 35-story<br />\nbuilding.'

I was the<br />\ncoordinator of the seminar on acquaintance rape presented yesterday by the Sexual Assault<br />\nRecovery Center. Mr. Engler<br />\nmisrepresented my views; not<br />\nmisquoted, just misrepresented.<br />\nFirst of all, the tone of the article implies that my most important concern is the difference between acquaintance rape and date<br />\nrape. This is not an important<br />\nissue. He got this impression<br />\nbecause when he used the term<br />\n\"date rape\" I would correct him.<br />\nI am sorry if he got the impression that the distinction was my<br />\n<br />\nmain point.<br />\nSeciondly, he quoted what his<br />\ndictionary defined as \"rape.\" My<br />\ndictionary also says that rape is<br />\n\"an act or instance of robbing or<br />\ndespoiling or carrying away<br />\nanother person by force.\" A person can sexually rob or despoil<br />\nanother's self-esteem, security<br />\nand happiness without intercourse<br />\nor penetration. Would you say<br />\nthat a woman who is forced to<br />\nperform oral sex with a man was<br />\nnot raped? Mr. Engler says that<br />\nwithout penetration this is not<br />\nrape at all. I, most rape<br />\ncounselors, and most rape victims<br />\nwould disagree.<br />\nRape is forced sexual behavior<br />\non another individual. If the aci<br />\nis not against someone's will then<br />\nit was not rape. If a woman submits out of fear, or out of physical<br />\ninability to resist (which can be<br />\ncaused by excessive alcohol), it<br />\nis still rape if it was against her<br />\nwill. It is not her fault if the attacker does not listen.<br />\nFinally, Mr. Engler's last<br />\nparagraph was a gross misinterpretation of my words. I never<br />\nsaid that every time a couple goes<br />\nhome drunkenly from a party,<br />\n-fools around\" or has sex, and<br />\nthen one of the parties regrets it<br />\nlater that it was rape. What I<br />\nwanted to convey is that acquaintance rape is a problem that occurs far too often, very often<br />\nwhen the participants are drunk,<br />\nand we need to be more careful<br />\nof our behavior.

Engler demonstrates a<br />\nserious lack of preparation and<br />\nunderstanding of his subject, that<br />\nreduces a potentially valuable article to an uninformed opinion in<br />\nprint.<br />\nEngler prefers his dictionary<br />\ndefinition of rape to the one provided by Vaidhyanathan, and<br />\nstates that violence and/or intercourse are necessary components of rape.

The fourteen. players<br />\nand their coaches just spent 12<br />\ndays visiting the United States.<br />\nIt was Hopkins' turn to host the<br />\nMendeleyev team; the Soviet<br />\nteam hosted the Blue Jays this<br />\npast May in Moscow.<br />\nZehring and other Hopkins<br />\nplayers were impressed by how<br />\nmuch the Soviets love the game<br />\nof baseball. \"These guys have<br />\nsuch a desire to play,\"says John<br />\nHomer, the Blue Jays' third<br />\nbaseman.<br />\nThe Soviet players, all students<br />\nor staff of the Mendeleyev Institute, were hungry to learn<br />\nabout the game. They practiced<br />\nevery chance they had. Some<br />\nmornings they even were on the<br />\nfield at 6:30 a.m.<br />\nAccording to the Hopkins<br />\nplayers, the Soviets simply don't<br />\nhave the facilities or the equipment to play baseball in their<br />\nhomeland. The Mendeleyev team<br />\npractices on a soccer field<br />\nin Moscow. Gloves, balls,<br />\nuniforms, and other equipment<br />\nare in very short supply.<br />\nDespite this disadvantage, their<br />\nAmerican hosts believe that they<br />\nhave \"a lot of potential.\"<br />\n\"They have improved a lot<br />\nsince May,\" said Ken Clark,<br />\nspeaking of the five Soviets who<br />\nwere on the team Hopkins played<br />\nagainst last May in Moscow.<br />\n<br />\nAdds Andy Fink, \"they have<br />\npicked up the finer points\" of the<br />\ngame and are at a level about<br />\n\"one step above Little League.\"<br />\nNot bad, considering most of<br />\nthe Soviet team that played here<br />\nhas only been working together<br />\nsince this summer.<br />\nClark believes that if the USSR<br />\never \"goes about baseball the<br />\nway they go about other sports,<br />\nthey'll be a power.\"<br />\nMany of the Soviet players<br />\nidolize American pros. Shortstop<br />\nIlya Bogatiryov's favorite is the<br />\nCardinal's Ozzie Smith, while<br />\ncatcher Vadim Kulakov tries to<br />\nemulate Gary Carter of the Mets.<br />\nVadim even curled his hair so he<br />\nwould look like his hero.<br />\nWhen the Hopkins team and<br />\nAmerican reporters were in<br />\nMoscow, Vadim sent back a letter to Carter. The Mets' all-star<br />\ncatcher responded quickly, but<br />\nhis response got_ stuck in<br />\nbureaucratic channels. But at the<br />\nfinal dinner for the teams, Vadim<br />\nfinally got his reply: a letter,<br />\nalong with complete catcher's<br />\ngear\u2014shin guards, chest protector, mask, and a glove.<br />\nAll his teammates and the<br />\nAmerican players stood up and<br />\ncheered, but the thoroughly surprised Vadim was the happiest<br />\nyoung man having dinner in the<br />\nGlass Pavilion that night.<br />\nThis kind of camaraderie was<br />\ntypical of the relations betweeen<br />\nthe players of the two teams.<br />\nThey overcame the challenge<br />\npresented by the language barrier. Interpreters from Goucher<br />\nand Towson State helped, as few<br />\nof the Soviet players knew<br />\nEnglish and none of the<br />\nAmericans knew Russian.<br />\nSome of the Soviets, however,<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\nSoviet Vadim Kulacov catches at the first baseball game between the US and USSR played on American soil.<br />\nstudiz1 English in secondary<br />\nschool'. With the help of the<br />\nHopkins players, they found it<br />\ncoming back to them. As<br />\nMendeleyev right fielder Alexander (Sasha) Leshansky talked<br />\nduring the farewell dinner,<br />\nHopkins catcher Marc Kligman<br />\nassisted by clarifying the conversations with simpler expressions<br />\nand gestures.<br />\nEighteen year-old Sasha is a second year student at the<br />\nMendeleyev Institute. He is from<br />\nTashkent and has, he shyly admits, a girlfriend there. Sasha<br />\nlives in a dormitory in Moscow.<br />\nHe complains that the dining hall<br />\nfood is both bad and expensive.<br />\nTo buy food and other things, he<br />\nnoted, you have to stand in line.<br />\nDespite the fact that food lines<br />\nhave not gotten any shorter since<br />\nGorbachev took power, Sasha ex-<br />\n<br />\nScott Tourtellotte<br />\n<br />\nPlayers from the Menedleyev Institute of Chemical Technology stand as the Soviet National Anthem is played.<br />\n<br />\n- t confidence in his<br />\npressed grea<br />\nnew President. His expression<br />\nand voice expressing the great enthusiam he felt, he says he thinks<br />\nthat things are getting better in his<br />\ncountry, thanks to Gorbachev.<br />\nSasha knows that change takes<br />\ntime, but he earnestly believes in<br />\nthe efforts taken by Gorbachev.<br />\nSasha also hopes to change the<br />\nopinions of his friends about the<br />\nUnited States. \"The newspapers<br />\nsay America is bad. My friends<br />\nbelieve the newspapers. I don't<br />\nknow if they will believe me,<br />\nwhen I go back and tell them that,<br />\nsee, America is not bad.\"<br />\nSasha and his teammates saw a<br />\ngreat deal of the East Coast during their stay. The Soviets saw<br />\nWashington, D. C., the eastern<br />\nshore of Maryland, and of<br />\ncourse, Baltimore. But the<br />\nplayers' favorite place was New<br />\nYork City. Sasha said he will<br />\nespecially remember the<br />\nskyscrapers and what he saw of<br />\nHarlem. Outfielder Valery Predin<br />\nalso loved the buildings and all<br />\nthe lights in the evening. Of all<br />\nthe sights, Valery remembers the<br />\nStatue of Liberty best.<br />\nOn their tours, the Soviets had<br />\nthe opportunity to go shopping<br />\nBy far the most popular purchase<br />\nwas sneakers. Says Hopkins<br />\nplayer Bill Paukovits, \"they were<br />\njust like kids at Christmas,\"<br />\nwhen they saw things that they<br />\ncannot get in their homeland.<br />\nRelates Hopkins teammate<br />\nDave Kiskis, remembering the<br />\nfirst time the Soviets saw an<br />\nautomatic teller machine, \"they<br />\ncouldn't get over how money<br />\ncame out of a wall. It really surprised them.\"<br />\nThe Mendeleyev players had<br />\nalso never seen a pitching<br />\nmachine until they saw the Blue<br />\nJays'.<br />\nBut the conversation between<br />\nthe Soviet and American players<br />\nconcentrated on their similarities.<br />\nWhen the players got to \"hang<br />\nout and rap,\" the conversation<br />\n<br />\nrevolved around girls, school,<br />\nmusic, and of course, baseball.<br />\nThe Mendeleyev Men talked<br />\nabout their favorite US players,<br />\nthe ongoing playoffs, and just the<br />\ngame itself. Said Hopkins center<br />\nfielder Ron Lewis, \"I don't think<br />\nanyone had politics on their mind,<br />\njust baseball.\"<br />\nAccording to some Hopkins<br />\nplayers, some of the best times for<br />\nboth teams were when they were<br />\ntogether in informal settings, unchaperoned, and without<br />\ntranslators. One of these times<br />\nwas the Soviets' first night here,<br />\nwhen all the players watched a<br />\nplayoff game together. While<br />\nthey could not communicate very<br />\nwell yet about other subjects, they<br />\nall understood the common terminology of baseball.<br />\nAnother one of these informal<br />\ntimes was the shopping trip<br />\nKligman, his mother, and Sasha<br />\ntook down to the Harbor. There<br />\nthey bought their Soviet friend a<br />\npair of Levis.<br />\nThrough these encounters and<br />\nthrough the three games played<br />\nhere, friendships formed between<br />\nplayers on the two teams. The<br />\nHopkins players would like to go<br />\nback and visit; their Soviet<br />\ncounterparts share this sentiment.<br />\nIt is not often that Soviet and<br />\nAmericans get to meet in a nonpolitical context. The image of<br />\nthe two nations' flags flying side<br />\nby side as their national anthems<br />\nplayed invoked emotion and pride<br />\non both sides. Says Kligman,<br />\n\"Standing looking at the flags, I<br />\nunderstood that in some small<br />\nway I was a part of history.\"<br />\nOn Homewood Field during<br />\nthose three games, amidst all the<br />\npitches thrown and outs made,<br />\nunderstanding was increased.<br />\nWhile Hopkins outscored the<br />\nMendeleyev team in terms of<br />\nruns, the overall score showed a<br />\nvictory in understanding for both<br />\nsides.<br />\n<br />\n\f16/OCTOBER 28, 1'988<br />\n<br />\nARTS:Hopkins Symphony Season Premiere Sunday<br />\nby Noam M.M. Neusner<br />\nAfter inventing the twelve-tone<br />\nscale, Arnold Schoenberg, the<br />\nmodern German composer,<br />\ndeclared his discovery would<br />\nperpetuate German superiority in<br />\nclassical music into the twentyfirst century. Many novice<br />\nclassical music listeners, upon<br />\nhearing Schoenberg's often atonal<br />\nmusic, might disregard this claim<br />\nas patriotic fervor.<br />\nYet evidenced by the over<br />\nwhelming favoritism accorded<br />\nmany German composers like<br />\nBeethoven, Bach, Mozart,<br />\n<br />\nMahler, and Wagner, it would<br />\nappear that these same listeners<br />\npractice an unquestioning<br />\npreference for these Germans.<br />\nThough Beethoven's Fifth is indeed a fantastic symphonic work,<br />\nit has nevertheless become a<br />\nparody of itself. Through this<br />\nteutonophilism, the classical<br />\nlistener becomes easily impressed by copycat symphonies which<br />\nemphasize grandeur and musical<br />\nloquaciousness. The image conjured up by the term \"classical<br />\nmusic\" is a white haired impresario conducting a powerful<br />\n<br />\norchestra with a unusually large<br />\nhorn section.<br />\nThus the invitation to see the<br />\nHopkins Symphony Orchestra<br />\nperform works of a distinctly different style. Featuring works by<br />\nAmerican composers Aaron<br />\nCopland and Peggy Stuart<br />\nCoolidge, the HSO kicks off its<br />\nseason on Sunday, October 30, 3<br />\np.m., in Shriver Hall.<br />\nBoth the Copland and Coolidge<br />\npieces represent a divergence<br />\nfrom the grand symphonies of the<br />\nGerman tradition. Stated clearly<br />\nas American works in their titles,<br />\n<br />\nOn Media: Minor Classics<br />\nStay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage<br />\nDisney Films<br />\nby T.H. Kern<br />\nIt's no secret that producers are<br />\noften the real talent behind great<br />\nrecords. Most producers,<br />\nhowever, are kept like secrets.<br />\nTheir names appear in small print<br />\non record covers (or not at all)<br />\nand they receive little public<br />\nrecognition for their work.<br />\nYet the fact persists that producers, more so than artists, dictate the direction of popular<br />\nmusic. Intentionally or not, producer Hal Willner has done exactly that. As the force behind an<br />\naudacious series of records which<br />\nhave revivified the works of<br />\n\"misplaced\" 20th century composers, he has sparked a minor<br />\nrenaissance in popular music.<br />\nIn 1981, Willner invited some<br />\nof the world's finest jazz musicians to interpret the works of<br />\nNino Rota, the unheralded genius<br />\nbehind Federico Fellini's legendary film scores. \"Amarcord<br />\nNino Rota\"(Hannibal 9301) was<br />\nWillner's first \"various artists\"<br />\nconcept record, and the results<br />\nwere astonishing.<br />\nPianist Jaki Byard played<br />\ndazzling variations on the themes<br />\nto \"Amarcord\" and \"La<br />\nStrada.\" Soprano saxophone<br />\nwizard Steve Lacy contributed an<br />\nintense \"Roma,\" and Carla Bley<br />\nstitched together a riotous medley<br />\nof themes from Fellini's \"8 /<br />\n1<br />\n2.\"<br />\nThe album spurted colors and textures; it worked splendidly. From<br />\nten very different performances,<br />\nWillner constructed a cohesive<br />\nrecord with surprising longevity.<br />\nA genre was born.<br />\nThe Rota tribute was intended<br />\nto be a one-time project. Yet in<br />\n1984 A&M Records released<br />\n\"That's the Way I Feel Now\"<br />\n(A&M 6600), a salute to jazz<br />\ngiant Thelonious Monk. Willner<br />\nrecruited a protean roster of<br />\nmusicians to resuscitate classics<br />\nfrom Monk's preeminent<br />\nsongbook. Though the cast of<br />\nperformers was far more<br />\nvariegated than on \"Amarcord<br />\nNino Rota,\" their mission was no<br />\nless ambitious. As arranger and<br />\nsaxophonist John Zorn put it,<br />\nmusicians were expected to give<br />\ntheir own, original definitions to<br />\nwords people already knew.<br />\nThe output of German expatriate Kurt Weill appeared in<br />\nfresh guises on 1985's \"Lost In<br />\nthe Stars\" (A&M 5104). Contributors ranged from the Armadillo String Quartet to Henry<br />\nThreadgill to Lou Reed, and each<br />\n<br />\nbizarre array of musicians to<br />\ndate. On the record, classic<br />\nAWAKE<br />\nDisney melodies are rendered in<br />\nmre<br />\n1,10*<br />\na kaleidoscopic range of settings<br />\nby the Replacements, Betty<br />\nCarter, Harry Nilsson, Suzanne<br />\nVega, NRBQ, Los Lobos, and a<br />\ndozen other artists, all in their<br />\nown styles. The effect is dizzying; the album plays like a wild<br />\nTechnicolor musical.<br />\nWillner later organized the<br />\ntrack forged Weill's melodies into<br />\nrecord into medleys to compenintriguing new shapes, with the<br />\nsate for the brevity of the songs.<br />\nessence of the music intact.<br />\nThe five medleys comprise<br />\nCritical response to the records<br />\nroughly common themes<br />\nenthusiastic<br />\nhighly<br />\nwas<br />\n(\"Pinocchio Theme,\" \"All Innoeach album outsold its<br />\ncent Children Had Better<br />\npredecessor.<br />\nBeware\") and further unity is<br />\nHal Willner had found an ideal<br />\nprovided by the gravelly-voiced<br />\nway to mine the rich deposits of<br />\nKen Nordine, who \"narrates\"<br />\nneglected 20th century music.<br />\nwith a tone both innocent and<br />\nFans of the composers heard the<br />\nominous\u2014classic Disney.<br />\ngreat works of Weill, Rota, and<br />\nEven without the works of a<br />\nMonk transfigured by a bold<br />\nsingle composer to provide its<br />\nassemblage of musicians.

Some of<br />\nthe songs are sharply produced,<br />\npotential singles, but most are<br />\nsimply Flat-sounding, derivative<br />\nand dull.<br />\nA group's presentation (visually and musically) on a compilation is critical since it is all the<br />\nlistener has to judge by. One song<br />\nis not enough to damn a band but<br />\nit can be sufficient to interest the<br />\nlistener in the band's next effort.<br />\nVisually, there's nothing happening.

Bowman was the<br />\npresident of Johns Hopkins from<br />\n1935 to 1948. He donated some<br />\nof his papers to MSE, including<br />\nsome of his letters from Peary.<br />\nHe died suddenly in 1950 without<br />\narranging for the disposition of<br />\nthe remainder of his documents.<br />\nSome were added to MSE's collection, but the rest went to<br />\nBowman's son, Robert. When<br />\nRobert Bowman retired in 1985<br />\nhe donated his father's papers to<br />\nMSE. Rawlins did some research<br />\n2<br />\nfor his book at the Special Collections Library in the early 70's.<br />\nHe returned to MSE in 1987 for<br />\nresearch in another area.

Some of<br />\nthe distances he claims to have<br />\ncovered in his records are inconsistent with his mode of travel.<br />\nHis expedition had four teams:<br />\ntwo teams went ahead to break<br />\nthe trail and build camps, and two<br />\nteams leapfrogged to the pole.<br />\nEach team carried supplies on<br />\n500-pound dogsleds, and the men<br />\nwalked alongside to help the dogs<br />\npull the sleds. In one two-day<br />\nperiod Peary's records would<br />\nhave him travel 130 miles. Most<br />\nof the experts of Peary's day were<br />\nconvinced that this was impossible, and accused him of falsifying his records.<br />\nAlthough Congressional hearings in 1910-1911 concluded that<br />\nPeary was the official discoverer<br />\nof the North Pole, the controversy persisted. In 1973, Rawlins<br />\npublished a landmark exposition<br />\nof the whole affair titled Peary at<br />\nthe North Pole: Fact or Fiction?<br />\nAfter exhaustive examination of<br />\nPeary's records, Rawlins found<br />\nseveral inconsistencies. Peary<br />\ntook readings of the sun's altitude<br />\nevery five days along the trek. At<br />\nthe poles, since they are the tips<br />\nof the earth's axis of rotation, the<br />\nsun does not appear to change<br />\naltitude above the horizon. During the Northern Hemisphere's<br />\nsummer, the sun never sets at the<br />\nNorth Pole, and never rises at the<br />\nSouth Pole.

No<br />\none knew these readings existed<br />\nisted. Geographers had assumed<br />\nthat Peary did not take readings<br />\nat the point he considered the<br />\nPole, and thus did not know he<br />\nhad missed. The readings showed that the sun's altitude was<br />\nchanging, which would not happen at the true pole. Peary would<br />\nhave known this, but no one on<br />\nhis crew would have known, and<br />\n<br />\nso he was able to perpetrate a<br />\nfraud. Peary gave these readings<br />\nto his wife Jo upon return from<br />\nthe Arctic, and told her to guard<br />\nthem with her life.<br />\nIn 1935, Marie Peary<br />\nremembered a list of numbers her<br />\nmother kept in a safe deposit box.<br />\nMarie made a copy of them to<br />\ngive to Bowman, who showed<br />\nthem to a friend and expert in<br />\nastronomical navigation, Harry<br />\nRaymond.Whether or not Raymond told Bowman about the<br />\nmeaning of these numbers is<br />\nunknown.

Differences in personal relations and<br />\nin theoretical work eventually<br />\ndrove the two men apart. Freud<br />\nbelieved that Jung was trying to<br />\nusurp his authority and power,<br />\nand he conveyed this attitude to<br />\nJung. Jung found Freud's attitude<br />\nintolerable, and he disassociated<br />\nhimself from Freud.<br />\nBosnak's book is fascinating<br />\nbecause it suggests that portions<br />\nof both Freud's and Jung's<br />\ntheoretical work are compatible<br />\nin some settings. For example,<br />\nwhen Bosnak, a Jungian analyst,<br />\nengages in dreamwork, he utilizes<br />\nboth Freud's method of free<br />\nassociation and Jung's method of<br />\nactive imagination.<br />\nFree association, Bosnak<br />\nstates, is the relation of specific<br />\n<br />\ndream images to the real world<br />\nconcerns of the dreamer. Bosnak<br />\nrelates to the reader one of his<br />\nown dreams:<br />\n\"I am in a house under construction. There is a beautiful great<br />\nSaint Bernard dog, called Angie,<br />\nwho is being attacked by a<br />\nbulldog I have on a leash. The<br />\nbulldog bites Angie's neck,<br />\nholding her there, and they disappear together, engaged in a deadly fight.\"<br />\nBosnak then attempts to<br />\ndiscover the meaning of the<br />\ndream by reflection and free<br />\nassociation:<br />\n\"Angie, angel. I don't know any<br />\nAngie. I've never seen the dog<br />\nbefore, even though she was very<br />\nfamiliar to me in the dream.<br />\nAngie? Yes, of course! A long<br />\ntime ago. She sang like an angel.<br />\nAngel? My wife.. .anger with<br />\nher? My mother? My daughter?\"<br />\nBosnak finds these associations<br />\ninconclusive. He insists \"The<br />\nbattle between my rescuing guardian angel and the devouring bite<br />\nof the bulldog is far from over.\"<br />\nThis means that the same images<br />\nwill return to him in future<br />\ndreams. Since he is an analyst and<br />\nan expert at the recall of his own<br />\ndreams, he believes he will be<br />\nable to make sense out of a series<br />\n<br />\nof similar images.<br />\nBosnak provides practical<br />\nmemory exercises that are<br />\ndesigned to enhance dream recall.<br />\nHe insists these methods can<br />\nwork for anybody because<br />\neverybody dreams. One of the<br />\nmethods he presents is Jung's active imagination.<br />\nActive imagination is a method<br />\nthat Bosnak uses to \"continue\"<br />\na series of dreams. The conscious<br />\nsubject, in order to utilize this<br />\nmethod, must close his eyes and<br />\nthink of a specific image from a<br />\ndream that he wants to<br />\nremember. Once a specific image<br />\nis recalled, it is possible to<br />\nreconstruct and continue a dream<br />\nthrough an active imagination<br />\nprocess.<br />\nThe book provides dramatic<br />\nreconstructions of workshops in<br />\nwhich a subject uses this method.<br />\nThe dreamer recounts his dream<br />\nas he is \"dreaming\" and the<br />\nmembers of the workshop assist<br />\nin the dream's interpretation.<br />\nThe analyst occasionally interrupts and asks the dreamer questions to stimulate the process.<br />\nA workshop setting is useful,<br />\naccording to Bosnak, because inSee DREAMS, 21<br />\n<br />\nMusings<br />\nOn Education<br />\nby Richard Bell<br />\nThe public school system in<br />\nthis country was founded to allow<br />\neveryone to acquire an education.<br />\nWhen the schools were founded,<br />\nthe public believed in education.<br />\nOver the years, that belief has<br />\nfaded.<br />\nThe American people, in<br />\ngeneral, no longer feel deprived<br />\nwhen they lack an education.<br />\nHowever, in recent years, an increasing interest has been<br />\ndemonstrated through studies and<br />\nmedia reports, but it seems<br />\nalmost casual in nature. With the<br />\nexception of a well-educated few,<br />\nthe public no longer cares.<br />\nThis loss of interest caused a<br />\ndecline in the quality of our national school system, with tragic<br />\nresults. According to the National<br />\nCommission on Excellence in<br />\napproximately<br />\nEducation,<br />\ntwenty-three million Americans<br />\nare functionally illiterate. Furthermore, scores on achievement<br />\ntests such as the SAT show an<br />\nalmost unbroken decline since the<br />\nearly 1960's. Even graduating<br />\ncollege students score lower on<br />\nachievement tests than in the past.<br />\nThis decay of American education causes problems for<br />\nemployers. Companies cannot<br />\ntrust an illiterate employee to use<br />\neven the simplest machinery.<br />\nWith the increasing use of high-<br />\n<br />\ntech equipment in manufacturing,<br />\nthe shortage of educated workers<br />\nwill become more pronounced.<br />\nThe first step in reforming our<br />\nschools is the introduction of<br />\ndiscipline back into the school<br />\nsystem. Drug sales, violence, and<br />\ngrade fixing (particularly evident<br />\nin athletic students) are criminal<br />\nand cannot be tolerated.<br />\nJoe Green was the principal of<br />\na school in New Jersey who successfully removed the criminals<br />\nresponsible for disrupting the<br />\nschool. He tolerated no infractions of the rules and used force<br />\nwhen necessary. He showed that<br />\ndiscipline is still effective.<br />\nThe second step is to improve<br />\nthe caliber of teachers. Higher<br />\nstandards must exist and greater<br />\nnumbers of qualified teachers<br />\nmust be brought into the school<br />\nsystem. To accomplish these<br />\ngoals, testing must be conducted<br />\nregularly to cull those who are<br />\nnot qualified. In addition, higher<br />\nsalaries must be introduced in<br />\norder to attract a more talented<br />\nstaff.<br />\nThe next step is allocation of<br />\ngreater government funds to<br />\neducation. This would necessitate<br />\neither an increase in taxation<br />\nwhich is an unattractive option or<br />\na reallocation of existing funds<br />\nfrom other government programs. More funding would permit the rise in salaries mentioned<br />\n<br />\nA basic handbook of'\u201411614$11W<br />\nJungian dr-eamwork<br />\n<br />\nabove. Also, the purchase of new<br />\nequipment such as computers,<br />\nnew textbooks, and facilities<br />\nwould become feasible.<br />\nThe last and probably most important step is to raise the public<br />\ninterest in education. To recreate<br />\na passion for knowledge and a<br />\ndesire for the best possible education is crucial in reforming the<br />\nschool system.<br />\nParents need to become more<br />\ninvolved in their children's<br />\nschooling. Conferences with<br />\nthat<br />\nchecking<br />\nteachers,<br />\nhomework is done, and helping at<br />\nthe school when needed are areas<br />\nin which parents must become involved before any improvement<br />\ncan occur.<br />\nThose of us fortunate enough to<br />\nhave received good educations<br />\nmust also help. We ought to take<br />\nthe lead in raising public<br />\nawareness, campaigning for<br />\nlegislation or tutoring students<br />\nwho need help.

His black<br />\nhair, cut in a stylish wedge, was in direct<br />\ncontrast to your blond ponytail. He had<br />\ngraduated from NYU the year before,<br />\na philosophy major, while you went to<br />\nschool in Baltimore, an unquestionably<br />\nintelligent but undistinguished student of<br />\ncomputer science. His cubby was a virtual shrine of pop culture with<br />\nphotographs by Anton Corbijn and<br />\nissues of European magazines like The<br />\nFace and Arena shuffled into the<br />\ngeneral chaos of technical schematics<br />\nand oak shoe lasts, while your neighboring cubicle seemed notable only for the<br />\ngenuine leather on the corners of your<br />\nblotter. Sterling had real confidence, like<br />\nhe belonged at Frontline. You, conversely, thought yourself a fluke hiring.<br />\nThe closest you ever got to designing<br />\nrunning shoes was your senior year of<br />\nhigh school when you ran to an unexpected second place at the state crosscountry meet in a pair of Nikes whose<br />\nsoles you had criss-crossed with slits for<br />\nimproved flexibility.<br />\nStill, Sterling had a positive effect on<br />\nyou, and you on him. Together the two<br />\nof you came up with marketable ideas<br />\nunique for their simplicity and practicality (air cushions under the heel, reflective shoelaces). Plus, you kept the CEO<br />\nhappy.<br />\nA year later, when you and your<br />\ngirlfriend moved out on each other after<br />\nthree months of frenetic, impulsive passion, it was he who put you up for a<br />\nmonth, kept your pride intact, and acted<br />\nthe commiserator on nights of not immoderate drink. At a bar one night, a<br />\nshared bottle of Cuervo on its side bet, ween you, he told you that he himself<br />\npursued women as a sort of therapeutic<br />\ncounterphobia, that he was deathly<br />\nafraid of women at heart, and you really understood that. Perhaps that was<br />\nwhy he always called you when he got<br />\ninto some of these positions of difficulty.<br />\nThe music suddenly turns into one<br />\nlong drum break and someone starts<br />\nscreaming. It's infectious and soon the<br />\nwhole place is screaming as though the<br />\nKhmer Rhouge had just shown up in<br />\nred wax lips and party hats. Even Buddha begins to vibrate.<br />\n<br />\nwomen are concerned, you are but a<br />\ndistant observer. His recent experiences, after all, are hardly to be envied. You remember those twins six<br />\nmonths ago that tried to strangle Sterling when they found out that he was<br />\nseeing each of them on alternating<br />\nnights. He pawned his gun for fifty<br />\ndollars after that. No more blood, he<br />\nsaid. Then a month later, there was<br />\nFiona, that thin anemic-looking girl who<br />\nhad her head cracked open by the<br />\nbowling ball in Sterling's kitchen cupboard (even a man can run out of closet<br />\nspace. What was it Sterling said she was<br />\nlooking for, oregano?). The two of you<br />\ndropped her in a dumpster behind<br />\nSears on Route 40. After them, all the<br />\nother accidents seemed unfortunate<br />\nchild's play, misplaced modifiers in the<br />\ngrammar that was Sterling Flynn's<br />\nlife. All I need is a whisper of luck, he<br />\nonce said, and all my problems would<br />\nbe solved. You just nodded.<br />\n\"Follow me,\" Sterling says. You nod,<br />\nget into his car, and key the ignition.<br />\n<br />\nIt's seven past one when you park at<br />\nthe end of a long pier, the last in a line<br />\nof piers which extends for two miles<br />\nalong the beach. The night breeze is<br />\nroguish and brittle.<br />\nSterling, little more than a silhouette,<br />\nis reaching into the Yugo's trunk when<br />\nyou ask him how he found this place.<br />\n\"There's a farmer's market every<br />\nSunday morning\"\u2014you notice a few tattered heads of lettuce on the ground\u2014<br />\n\"and I overheard someone say that that<br />\nwas the only time the pier ever saw people.\" He pulls a forty gallon Hefty out<br />\nof the trunk. \"Help me with this.\"<br />\nYou don't hear the splash, the breeze<br />\nis so strong, and Sterling says<br />\nsomething you don't hear. Then\u2014<br />\nmaybe it's the congratulant set of Sterling's shoulders, or the way he routinely<br />\ntakes out a cigarette\u2014something occurs<br />\nto you.

Scott, the Director<br />\nof Athletics, affirmed, \"We<br />\ndefinitely know that there is a<br />\nneed for improved facilities; it is<br />\nacknowledged by the administration.\" Dr. Muller himself listed<br />\nin last May's graduation address<br />\nthat severa needs exist, and one<br />\nwas a new Athletic Center.<br />\nThe problem with the existing<br />\n<br />\nAthletic Center is that it is too<br />\nsmall to meet all the needs of the<br />\nstudents that use the building. It<br />\nwas built in 1965 for an all-male<br />\npopulation, and six years later,<br />\nwhen the University went co-ed,<br />\nthe women athletes were given a<br />\ncut-up and redesigned corner of<br />\nthe men's locker rooms, a lessthan-adequate space.<br />\nAnother problem connected<br />\nwith the lack of space is the need<br />\nfor more basketball court time for<br />\nrecreational usage. Between October and the end of February, the<br />\ncourts are used by the women's<br />\nvolleyball team, the two men's<br />\nbasketball teams, the women's<br />\nbasketball team, and the BIA<br />\n(volleyball, basketball, and badminton). Pick-up games are virtually impossible, as both gyms<br />\nare tied up for practically the<br />\nwhole winter.<br />\nThe only solution to the space<br />\nproblems is to build onto the<br />\nAthletic Center, as there is no<br />\nmore room to make changes<br />\nwithin the building. According to<br />\nScott, \"What we need is a whole<br />\nnew facility.\" A preliminary<br />\n<br />\nathletic staff meeting has already<br />\nbeen held this fall, and it identified about fifteen areas targeted<br />\nfor improvement. Additional<br />\nbasketball courts for casual play<br />\nand expanded locker room space<br />\nfor the women were named as top<br />\npriorities, but the staff would also<br />\nlike to add a new weight room,<br />\nmore racquetball and squash<br />\ncourts, improved dance facilities,<br />\nand more. An ideal situation<br />\nwould be the creation of a brand<br />\nnew fieldhouse, possibly built<br />\nbehind the Athletic Center where<br />\nROTC is located. The fieldhouse<br />\nwould have three to four combasketball/tenbination<br />\nnis/volleyball courts surrounded<br />\nby a 200 meter indoor track,<br />\nlocker rooms, and a weight room,<br />\nbut construction plans are not<br />\nslated for the immediate future.<br />\nThe next step is a committee<br />\nmeeting in late January, made up<br />\nof all constituents of the University, to present the desires for the<br />\nnew facility to the administration.<br />\n\"We're just scratching the surface this year,\" said Scott, \"but<br />\narchitectural drawings could be<br />\n<br />\nforthcoming soon.\"<br />\nThe last major student concern<br />\nhas been the general weight<br />\nroom, a situation that the University has recently been working on<br />\ncontinually. Since last spring,<br />\nHopkins has spent between<br />\n$4,000 and $5,000 on improvements for the weight room.<br />\nRecent purchases include a new<br />\nOlympic barbell set, twelve<br />\ndumbells, and two exercise<br />\nbicycles. The Athletic Center has<br />\njust received approval from Dean<br />\nColombo's office for the funds to<br />\ninstall a wall of mirrors along the<br />\nback wall of the weight room<br />\nbehind the free weights, and after<br />\nthat is looking to install an overhed ceiling fan to improve ventilation. Bob Scott has also contracted an outside firm to<br />\nperiodically monitor the condition<br />\nof the equipment, performing<br />\npreventative maintenance and<br />\nreplacing needed parts. The company is currently waiting for an<br />\nordered part to fix the broken<br />\nquadracep machine. Unfortunately, there is no more room in the<br />\ngeneral weight room for extra<br />\n<br />\nequipment because of safety.<br />\n\"We are very sensitive to the<br />\ncondition of the weight room,\"<br />\nScott stated.<br />\nAnother improvement to the<br />\nAthletic Center facilities is the<br />\nrenovation of the lower playing<br />\nfield, scheuled for next summer,<br />\nwhen the nearby construction on<br />\nthe new physics building is further along. \"Football, soccer,<br />\nand field hockey suffered on it all<br />\nfall,\" Scott said, \"and our Division I men's lacrosse team and<br />\nDivision III women's lacrosse<br />\nteam will have to suffer on it next<br />\nspring. There is no sense in fixing the field before that when<br />\ntrucks drive over it every day.\"<br />\nAll in all, the Administration,<br />\nand especially Bob Scott, seem to<br />\nbe sincerely interested in giving<br />\nthe students the improved athletic<br />\nfacilities that they need and want.<br />\nFunding is always going to be a<br />\nproblem, especially in the<br />\nendeavor of building a large<br />\nfacility. But, as Scott said, \"This<br />\nis a high powered University. It's<br />\ncoming, but just how soon we<br />\ndon't know.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f24/OCTOBER 28, 1988<br />\n<br />\nField hockey eliminated from MAC playoffs<br />\nby Laura Perlinn<br />\n<br />\nThe women's field hockey<br />\nteam ended their season on a sad<br />\nnote this week, losing to Gettysburg 2-0 last Friday in a playoff for the MAC Southwest section title and losing to Lebanon<br />\nValley 2-1 last Monday in the<br />\nfirst round of the MAC playoffs.<br />\nIn the loss at Gettysburg, their<br />\nsecond of the season, the Jays<br />\nplayed well enough to win but<br />\n<br />\ncouldn't capitalize on any scoring<br />\nopportunities.

The<br />\nJays controlled the last ten<br />\nminutes of the game, and almost<br />\ntied it, when with one minute left,<br />\nFatula shot the ball past the<br />\ngoalie, but the goal was called<br />\nback because a Hopkins forward<br />\nhad been offsides.

In the halfcourse match, Hopkins scored<br />\n1970 to Princeton's 1667.<br />\n<br />\nOnce again, junior Jim<br />\nKielkopf was Hopkins' leading<br />\nshooter, firing 60 shots for 516<br />\npoints out of 600. At one point<br />\nearly in the match, Coach Sam<br />\nHardy believed that Hopkins' victory was in jeopardy when he<br />\nreceived mistaken information<br />\n<br />\nabout a shooter, but this proved<br />\nto be quite false. The strong<br />\nshowing by Hopkins junior Larry<br />\nYoung, however, is what sealed<br />\nPrinceton's fate. Young fired his<br />\npersonal best, putting pressure on<br />\nPrinceton's top shooters to catch<br />\nup. Princeton's concentration was<br />\n<br />\nbroken, and they fired a dismal<br />\ncourse, with only one of their<br />\nmarksmen displaying a score<br />\ncomparable to the Hopkins sharpshooters' performances. Also firing for Hopkins: senior Neil Seidman,junior Matthew Mayr, and<br />\nsophomore Matt Fischer.<br />\n<br />\nGuaranteed<br />\nLowest<br />\nFares!!<br />\n<br />\nJHU ...

It had<br />\nbroken down, as it had at least<br />\nonce a day for the last month and<br />\na half. Carl Reavis, who managed the buildings under [property<br />\nmanager Betty] Pulling, came out<br />\nand said that they did not<br />\nguarantee elevator service. When<br />\nhe said that, I got really ticked<br />\noff.\"<br />\nSenior Brigid Joyce, who coorganized the petition with<br />\nseniors Anne Marie Hamilton,<br />\nAdam Lowe, and Wiley, all twoyear residents of the Charles, said<br />\nthe situation has \"gotten worse<br />\nevery year. The Charles really<br />\nhas not remained competitive.\"<br />\nNoting that the lobby was attractive and well furnished when<br />\nhe moved in, Wiley said it now<br />\nhas only \"a pullout sofa bed.\" He<br />\nobserved that the building no<br />\nlonger accepts packages, the<br />\nmaintenance crew has repaid turnover, and thefts seem more<br />\nprevalent.<br />\nReavis disagreed with student<br />\nperceptions of poor maintenance.<br />\n\"It has been my impression that<br />\nwe have been addressing<br />\nmaintenance problems in an increasingly efficient fashion,\"he<br />\nsaid. \"Mrs. Pulling said that<br />\nwhen she came on the job in<br />\nJanuary, there were work orders<br />\nbacked up to August. Service<br />\ncalls are now being answered or<br />\nat least inspected within twentyfour hours.\"<br />\nJoe Harper, part of the<br />\nmaintenance crew for the<br />\nbuildings until the end of the summer, countered that maintenance<br />\nhas not been up to par since the<br />\ndeparture of Building Manager<br />\nWendy Blum for the Hopkins<br />\nHouse apartments earlier this<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"The buildings have gone<br />\ndownhill, considerably, \" he<br />\nsaid. Pointing out the necessity<br />\nfor having staff available to run<br />\nthe freight elevators during frequent breakdowns of the regular<br />\nelevator put much strain on the<br />\nstaff, Harper said Pulling \"came<br />\nin here and had us snitching<br />\naround the crowd. It wasn't like<br /><br />\nAndrea Kaufman<br /><br />\nThe Charles<br />\na job anymore, but more like a little plot.\"<br />\nReavis admitted to the elevator<br />\nproblems. Explaining that the<br />\nbuilding has a service contract for<br />\nthe elevators, he suggested that<br />\nshortcomings in the service contractor's performance have been<br />\nremedied for the most part, but<br />\nthat \"our service contract excludes vandalism. The two times<br />\nthat the Blackstone elevator has<br />\nbeen out lately is because someone has torn the operating<br />\npanels off.\"<br />\nConstant vandalism in the<br />\nBlackstone and the Charles is a<br />\nproblem both management and<br />\nresidents have noted. Reavis said,<br />\n\"It's not a problem with our<br />\nresidents, but rather with our<br />\nresidents' guests.\"<br />\nWiley acknowledged the vandalism problem, saying, \"I'd like<br /><br />\nto find out who's doing the vandalism, because it's just making<br />\nit a lot worse for the rest of us.\"<br />\nIn response to complaints by<br />\nresidents as to thefts and<br />\nburglaries in the buildings,<br />\nReavis acknowledged a problem<br />\nwith employees having master<br />\nkeys they should not have had,<br />\nbut said, \"We have inherited a<br />\nsituation [from previous management] but we have been collecting<br />\nevidence and we've been able to<br />\ndiscern a pattern\" in reported<br />\nthefts, \"and we've been trying to<br />\nstraighten it out.\"<br />\nPulling responded to complaints that the buildings would<br />\nno longer accept packages by saying that a United Parcel package<br />\nhad disappeared earlier in the<br />\nyear. As a result of that theft, someone filed a lawsuit. In<br />\nresponse, Pulling said the threat<br /><br />\nBent Goro<br /><br />\nThe elevator in the Charles apartment building, a prime source of tenant dissatisfaction with the building.<br />\nof losing the buildings' liability<br />\ninsurance prompted her to cancel<br />\nthe service.<br />\nBlum, who did accept packages<br />\nfor residents during her tenure,<br />\ndisagreed with Pulling's portrayal<br />\nof the problem as an insurance<br />\none, saying instead, \"They [the<br />\nnew management] did not want<br />\nthe responsibility. Every other<br />\nbuilding in the neighborhood accepts their residents' packages.\"<br />\nReavis said vandalism is to<br />\nblame for the current appearance<br />\nof the Blackstone's and Charles's<br />\nlobbies. Pointing out that furniture that had been in the<br />\nBlackstone's lobby was stolen,<br />\nReavis said, \"The couch out<br />\nthere [in the Charles's lobby] is<br />\nthe same couch as before, but it<br />\nhas been recovered. The couches<br />\nthat were out there were in bad<br />\nrepair. We decided that one<br /><br />\nwould suffice, and given the experience in the Blackstone, we<br />\ndidn't want to refurbish<br />\neverything and have people walk<br />\noff with it.\"<br />\nPulling said management is investing in \"vandalism-resistant<br />\nelevator panels\" in an effort to<br />\nimprove the elevators' reliability.<br />\nWiley disagreed that vandalism<br />\nis the source of all problems, saying, \"They're not really putting<br />\nanything back into the building.<br />\nArchitecturally, it's beautiful, but<br />\nit's like they're [stripping] the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nMrs. Pulling's<br />\nphilosophy since she has taken<br />\nover seems to be that if there's a<br />\nproblem with something, simply<br />\neliminate the service altogether.\"<br />\nHe cited the closing of the mail<br />\nchute as an example.

It noted that the relationships<br />\nbetween administrators, faculty, staff,<br />\nand students were at the heart of the problems of the human climate. It claimed<br />\nan \"artificial separation\" of the community exists, creating an \"elitist and<br />\nexclusive\" hierarchy which made certain members feel like second-class<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nWe are faced today with the unenviable task of assessing the University's<br />\nclimate a full year after its release.<br />\nUnenviable, we say, because it is very<br />\ndifficult to meter an intangible such as<br />\n\"climate\". At this point, we can only<br />\nlook at the quantifiable results. For example, how many of the changes the<br />\nreport called for to improve the climate<br />\nwere actually realized?<br />\nOn a human level, certainly we have<br />\nseen much implementation of recommendations. Many committees have<br />\nbeen formed and offices instituted, most<br />\nnotably that of the Ombudsman, Dr.<br />\nSigmund Suskind. People from all<br />\nwalks of life at Homewood have shown<br />\na sincere desire for change.<br />\nThis desire has carried over into the<br />\nareas that many students are most interested in\u2014amenities such as a student<br />\nunion and improvements in financial<br />\naid, the athletic center, and housing.<br />\nAdministrators pledge to address problems in these specific areas and will<br />\ndetail ways to improve them. We<br />\nunderstand that problems of great<br />\nmagnitude cannot be solved overnight<br />\nand we appreciate that effective pro-<br /><br />\ngrams of change require time and<br />\nthought to develop.<br />\nThese programs also require one<br />\nessential ingredient: money. This brings<br />\nus to the crux of the problem\u2014along<br />\nwith the release of the report last year,<br />\nthe University announced a massive<br />\ndeficit in Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe University is in a good position:<br />\nit has not only pinpointed the issues that<br />\nit needs to address but has people with<br />\nenough initiative to resolve them. It is<br />\npainfully obvious, however, that the<br />\ntangible improvements the report calls<br />\nfor can never come about with the<br />\nUniversity's current fiscal situation.<br />\nArts and Sciences is expected, as are<br />\nall divisions of the University, to<br />\noperate with financial autonomy. The<br />\nhistory of the University, and indeed,<br />\nArts and Sciences' current situation prove this assumption fallacious. The division simply cannot attract the level of<br />\nendowments it needs to operate satisfactorily. After all, as President Muller is<br />\nso fond of saying, \"nobody ever died<br />\nof English.\"<br />\nThe University must necessarily be<br />\nrealistic about the pointlessness of its<br />\npolicy. There is no use pretending that<br />\nthe division can generate the funds<br />\nnecessary for its existence, let alone for<br />\nimprovements. We call for the administration to assess budget appropriations for all its divisions. Perhaps it is<br />\nnot such a good idea to stress independence among divisions.<br />\nIf The Johns Hopkins Instituions elect<br />\nto have an undergraduate division, they<br />\nshould shoulder the responsibility of<br />\nfinancing it. As it is now, it is completely unfair to present and future students<br />\nto allow Homewood to snuff itself out.<br /><br />\nHousing fraternities<br />\nThe past few years have seen the attempted formation of several fraternities<br />\nat Homewood\u2014some successful, some<br />\nnot. Such attempts require a great deal<br />\nof initiative on the part of their<br />\norganizers, who face several obstacles<br />\nalong their path. Not only must they<br />\ngather together a sufficient number of<br />\ninterested individuals, but they must<br />\nfight bureaucratic channels\u2014those of<br />\nthe Interfraternity Council, their national organizations, and the University.<br />\nHaving surmounted these obstacles,<br />\nthe fledgling fraternity's next logical<br />\nstep is to try to procure a house. After<br />\nall, such is the core of the social<br />\nworkings\u2014the concrete symbol\u2014of the<br />\nfraternity. However, this has proved<br />\nproblematic.<br />\nBaltimore City Laws specifically prohibit establishment of fraternity houses<br />\nin our surrounding communities. There<br />\nis no effective way for Hopkins students<br />\nto protest city ordinances inasmuch as<br />\nwe are not permanent residents of the<br />\narea, even though we comprise a significant portion of the surrounding<br /><br />\npopulation.<br />\nWe can understand the communities'<br />\nresistance to frat houses\u2014certainly,<br />\nloud parties are no fun unless you're<br />\nthere. However, there is more to fraternity life than its parties. This weekend's<br />\nPhi Psi 500 is evidence of that.<br />\nThe University seems to feel a need<br />\nfor fraternities as well. The attention<br />\ngiven them, for example, by Special<br />\nAssistant to the Dean of Students Mary<br />\nEllen Porter indicates a recognition on<br />\nits part of the fraternities' positive<br />\npotential force within the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAccordingly, the University should<br />\ngive more support to the frats' efforts<br />\nto secure houses. After all, Hopkins has<br />\nthe power to exert a lot of influence and<br />\ncan act as an advocate for the fraternities' plight.<br />\nThese laws have existed since the mid<br />\n1970's\u2014the University has had over ten<br />\nyears to \"try to determine the best<br />\ncourse\" to remedy the situation.

On<br />\nthe basis of Barron's College<br />\nGuide, you have narrowed your<br />\nlist of potential universities down<br />\nto a number that you can count on<br />\none hand.

There have been<br />\nslight increases every year for a<br />\n\"few years now,\" but they are<br /><br />\nconsidering building more oncampus housing to accomodate.<br />\nthe extra students. There are now<br />\n3400 International Relations majors, a new record, and four<br />\npolitical science professors.<br />\nMuller expresses his confidence<br />\nin the shrunken department, saying that Hopkins exposes its<br />\nstudents a little earlier to the real<br />\nworld, but that the pros far<br />\noutweigh the cons in the long run.<br />\nThe video goes on for a while<br />\nlonger, discussing the various<br />\ndepartments and their merits.<br />\nMuller points out that Hopkins<br />\nhas become the first major<br />\nuniversity with more gardeners<br />\nthan faculty members and suggests that they have expanded<br />\ntheir fleet of miniature street<br />\ncleaning machines so that we<br />\nhave a Plant Operations department which is the envy of the<br />\nworld.<br />\nAfter a short while, the<br />\nsecretary comes back in and introduces you to a Blue Key robot,<br />\nwho offers to take you on a tour<br />\nof the campus. As you walk out<br />\nof Garland, the first thing that<br />\nstrikes you is a 35-story<br />\nbuilding.' It's the new Chemistry<br />\nbuilding,\" says your Blue Key<br />\nmachine;\"solid gold and modeled on the Taj Mahal.\" You ask<br />\nwhere the student union is, but<br />\nthe robot just chirps and points<br />\nout that Hopkins has more<br />\npigeons per square foot than any<br />\nother university in Baltimore.

I was the<br />\ncoordinator of the seminar on acquaintance rape presented yesterday by the Sexual Assault<br />\nRecovery Center. Mr. Engler<br />\nmisrepresented my views; not<br />\nmisquoted, just misrepresented.<br />\nFirst of all, the tone of the article implies that my most important concern is the difference between acquaintance rape and date<br />\nrape. This is not an important<br />\nissue. He got this impression<br />\nbecause when he used the term<br />\n\"date rape\" I would correct him.<br />\nI am sorry if he got the impression that the distinction was my<br /><br />\nmain point.<br />\nSeciondly, he quoted what his<br />\ndictionary defined as \"rape.\" My<br />\ndictionary also says that rape is<br />\n\"an act or instance of robbing or<br />\ndespoiling or carrying away<br />\nanother person by force.\" A person can sexually rob or despoil<br />\nanother's self-esteem, security<br />\nand happiness without intercourse<br />\nor penetration. Would you say<br />\nthat a woman who is forced to<br />\nperform oral sex with a man was<br />\nnot raped? Mr. Engler says that<br />\nwithout penetration this is not<br />\nrape at all. I, most rape<br />\ncounselors, and most rape victims<br />\nwould disagree.<br />\nRape is forced sexual behavior<br />\non another individual. If the aci<br />\nis not against someone's will then<br />\nit was not rape. If a woman submits out of fear, or out of physical<br />\ninability to resist (which can be<br />\ncaused by excessive alcohol), it<br />\nis still rape if it was against her<br />\nwill. It is not her fault if the attacker does not listen.<br />\nFinally, Mr. Engler's last<br />\nparagraph was a gross misinterpretation of my words. I never<br />\nsaid that every time a couple goes<br />\nhome drunkenly from a party,<br />\n-fools around\" or has sex, and<br />\nthen one of the parties regrets it<br />\nlater that it was rape. What I<br />\nwanted to convey is that acquaintance rape is a problem that occurs far too often, very often<br />\nwhen the participants are drunk,<br />\nand we need to be more careful<br />\nof our behavior.

Engler demonstrates a<br />\nserious lack of preparation and<br />\nunderstanding of his subject, that<br />\nreduces a potentially valuable article to an uninformed opinion in<br />\nprint.<br />\nEngler prefers his dictionary<br />\ndefinition of rape to the one provided by Vaidhyanathan, and<br />\nstates that violence and/or intercourse are necessary components of rape.

The fourteen. players<br />\nand their coaches just spent 12<br />\ndays visiting the United States.<br />\nIt was Hopkins' turn to host the<br />\nMendeleyev team; the Soviet<br />\nteam hosted the Blue Jays this<br />\npast May in Moscow.<br />\nZehring and other Hopkins<br />\nplayers were impressed by how<br />\nmuch the Soviets love the game<br />\nof baseball. \"These guys have<br />\nsuch a desire to play,\"says John<br />\nHomer, the Blue Jays' third<br />\nbaseman.<br />\nThe Soviet players, all students<br />\nor staff of the Mendeleyev Institute, were hungry to learn<br />\nabout the game. They practiced<br />\nevery chance they had. Some<br />\nmornings they even were on the<br />\nfield at 6:30 a.m.<br />\nAccording to the Hopkins<br />\nplayers, the Soviets simply don't<br />\nhave the facilities or the equipment to play baseball in their<br />\nhomeland. The Mendeleyev team<br />\npractices on a soccer field<br />\nin Moscow. Gloves, balls,<br />\nuniforms, and other equipment<br />\nare in very short supply.<br />\nDespite this disadvantage, their<br />\nAmerican hosts believe that they<br />\nhave \"a lot of potential.\"<br />\n\"They have improved a lot<br />\nsince May,\" said Ken Clark,<br />\nspeaking of the five Soviets who<br />\nwere on the team Hopkins played<br />\nagainst last May in Moscow.<br /><br />\nAdds Andy Fink, \"they have<br />\npicked up the finer points\" of the<br />\ngame and are at a level about<br />\n\"one step above Little League.\"<br />\nNot bad, considering most of<br />\nthe Soviet team that played here<br />\nhas only been working together<br />\nsince this summer.<br />\nClark believes that if the USSR<br />\never \"goes about baseball the<br />\nway they go about other sports,<br />\nthey'll be a power.\"<br />\nMany of the Soviet players<br />\nidolize American pros. Shortstop<br />\nIlya Bogatiryov's favorite is the<br />\nCardinal's Ozzie Smith, while<br />\ncatcher Vadim Kulakov tries to<br />\nemulate Gary Carter of the Mets.<br />\nVadim even curled his hair so he<br />\nwould look like his hero.<br />\nWhen the Hopkins team and<br />\nAmerican reporters were in<br />\nMoscow, Vadim sent back a letter to Carter. The Mets' all-star<br />\ncatcher responded quickly, but<br />\nhis response got_ stuck in<br />\nbureaucratic channels. But at the<br />\nfinal dinner for the teams, Vadim<br />\nfinally got his reply: a letter,<br />\nalong with complete catcher's<br />\ngear\u2014shin guards, chest protector, mask, and a glove.<br />\nAll his teammates and the<br />\nAmerican players stood up and<br />\ncheered, but the thoroughly surprised Vadim was the happiest<br />\nyoung man having dinner in the<br />\nGlass Pavilion that night.<br />\nThis kind of camaraderie was<br />\ntypical of the relations betweeen<br />\nthe players of the two teams.<br />\nThey overcame the challenge<br />\npresented by the language barrier. Interpreters from Goucher<br />\nand Towson State helped, as few<br />\nof the Soviet players knew<br />\nEnglish and none of the<br />\nAmericans knew Russian.<br />\nSome of the Soviets, however,<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br /><br />\nSoviet Vadim Kulacov catches at the first baseball game between the US and USSR played on American soil.<br />\nstudiz1 English in secondary<br />\nschool'. With the help of the<br />\nHopkins players, they found it<br />\ncoming back to them. As<br />\nMendeleyev right fielder Alexander (Sasha) Leshansky talked<br />\nduring the farewell dinner,<br />\nHopkins catcher Marc Kligman<br />\nassisted by clarifying the conversations with simpler expressions<br />\nand gestures.<br />\nEighteen year-old Sasha is a second year student at the<br />\nMendeleyev Institute. He is from<br />\nTashkent and has, he shyly admits, a girlfriend there. Sasha<br />\nlives in a dormitory in Moscow.<br />\nHe complains that the dining hall<br />\nfood is both bad and expensive.<br />\nTo buy food and other things, he<br />\nnoted, you have to stand in line.<br />\nDespite the fact that food lines<br />\nhave not gotten any shorter since<br />\nGorbachev took power, Sasha ex-<br /><br />\nScott Tourtellotte<br /><br />\nPlayers from the Menedleyev Institute of Chemical Technology stand as the Soviet National Anthem is played.<br /><br />\n- t confidence in his<br />\npressed grea<br />\nnew President.

My friends<br />\nbelieve the newspapers. I don't<br />\nknow if they will believe me,<br />\nwhen I go back and tell them that,<br />\nsee, America is not bad.\"<br />\nSasha and his teammates saw a<br />\ngreat deal of the East Coast during their stay. The Soviets saw<br />\nWashington, D. C., the eastern<br />\nshore of Maryland, and of<br />\ncourse, Baltimore. But the<br />\nplayers' favorite place was New<br />\nYork City. Sasha said he will<br />\nespecially remember the<br />\nskyscrapers and what he saw of<br />\nHarlem. Outfielder Valery Predin<br />\nalso loved the buildings and all<br />\nthe lights in the evening. Of all<br />\nthe sights, Valery remembers the<br />\nStatue of Liberty best.<br />\nOn their tours, the Soviets had<br />\nthe opportunity to go shopping<br />\nBy far the most popular purchase<br />\nwas sneakers. Says Hopkins<br />\nplayer Bill Paukovits, \"they were<br />\njust like kids at Christmas,\"<br />\nwhen they saw things that they<br />\ncannot get in their homeland.<br />\nRelates Hopkins teammate<br />\nDave Kiskis, remembering the<br />\nfirst time the Soviets saw an<br />\nautomatic teller machine, \"they<br />\ncouldn't get over how money<br />\ncame out of a wall. It really surprised them.\"<br />\nThe Mendeleyev players had<br />\nalso never seen a pitching<br />\nmachine until they saw the Blue<br />\nJays'.<br />\nBut the conversation between<br />\nthe Soviet and American players<br />\nconcentrated on their similarities.<br />\nWhen the players got to \"hang<br />\nout and rap,\" the conversation<br /><br />\nrevolved around girls, school,<br />\nmusic, and of course, baseball.<br />\nThe Mendeleyev Men talked<br />\nabout their favorite US players,<br />\nthe ongoing playoffs, and just the<br />\ngame itself. Said Hopkins center<br />\nfielder Ron Lewis, \"I don't think<br />\nanyone had politics on their mind,<br />\njust baseball.\"<br />\nAccording to some Hopkins<br />\nplayers, some of the best times for<br />\nboth teams were when they were<br />\ntogether in informal settings, unchaperoned, and without<br />\ntranslators. One of these times<br />\nwas the Soviets' first night here,<br />\nwhen all the players watched a<br />\nplayoff game together. While<br />\nthey could not communicate very<br />\nwell yet about other subjects, they<br />\nall understood the common terminology of baseball.<br />\nAnother one of these informal<br />\ntimes was the shopping trip<br />\nKligman, his mother, and Sasha<br />\ntook down to the Harbor. There<br />\nthey bought their Soviet friend a<br />\npair of Levis.<br />\nThrough these encounters and<br />\nthrough the three games played<br />\nhere, friendships formed between<br />\nplayers on the two teams. The<br />\nHopkins players would like to go<br />\nback and visit; their Soviet<br />\ncounterparts share this sentiment.<br />\nIt is not often that Soviet and<br />\nAmericans get to meet in a nonpolitical context. The image of<br />\nthe two nations' flags flying side<br />\nby side as their national anthems<br />\nplayed invoked emotion and pride<br />\non both sides. Says Kligman,<br />\n\"Standing looking at the flags, I<br />\nunderstood that in some small<br />\nway I was a part of history.\"<br />\nOn Homewood Field during<br />\nthose three games, amidst all the<br />\npitches thrown and outs made,<br />\nunderstanding was increased.<br />\nWhile Hopkins outscored the<br />\nMendeleyev team in terms of<br />\nruns, the overall score showed a<br />\nvictory in understanding for both<br />\nsides.<br /><br />\n16/OCTOBER 28, 1'988<br /><br />\nARTS:Hopkins Symphony Season Premiere Sunday<br />\nby Noam M.M. Neusner<br />\nAfter inventing the twelve-tone<br />\nscale, Arnold Schoenberg, the<br />\nmodern German composer,<br />\ndeclared his discovery would<br />\nperpetuate German superiority in<br />\nclassical music into the twentyfirst century. Many novice<br />\nclassical music listeners, upon<br />\nhearing Schoenberg's often atonal<br />\nmusic, might disregard this claim<br />\nas patriotic fervor.<br />\nYet evidenced by the over<br />\nwhelming favoritism accorded<br />\nmany German composers like<br />\nBeethoven, Bach, Mozart,<br /><br />\nMahler, and Wagner, it would<br />\nappear that these same listeners<br />\npractice an unquestioning<br />\npreference for these Germans.<br />\nThough Beethoven's Fifth is indeed a fantastic symphonic work,<br />\nit has nevertheless become a<br />\nparody of itself. Through this<br />\nteutonophilism, the classical<br />\nlistener becomes easily impressed by copycat symphonies which<br />\nemphasize grandeur and musical<br />\nloquaciousness. The image conjured up by the term \"classical<br />\nmusic\" is a white haired impresario conducting a powerful<br /><br />\norchestra with a unusually large<br />\nhorn section.<br />\nThus the invitation to see the<br />\nHopkins Symphony Orchestra<br />\nperform works of a distinctly different style. Featuring works by<br />\nAmerican composers Aaron<br />\nCopland and Peggy Stuart<br />\nCoolidge, the HSO kicks off its<br />\nseason on Sunday, October 30, 3<br />\np.m., in Shriver Hall.<br />\nBoth the Copland and Coolidge<br />\npieces represent a divergence<br />\nfrom the grand symphonies of the<br />\nGerman tradition. Stated clearly<br />\nas American works in their titles,<br /><br />\nOn Media: Minor Classics<br />\nStay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage<br />\nDisney Films<br />\nby T.H. Kern<br />\nIt's no secret that producers are<br />\noften the real talent behind great<br />\nrecords. Most producers,<br />\nhowever, are kept like secrets.<br />\nTheir names appear in small print<br />\non record covers (or not at all)<br />\nand they receive little public<br />\nrecognition for their work.<br />\nYet the fact persists that producers, more so than artists, dictate the direction of popular<br />\nmusic. Intentionally or not, producer Hal Willner has done exactly that. As the force behind an<br />\naudacious series of records which<br />\nhave revivified the works of<br />\n\"misplaced\" 20th century composers, he has sparked a minor<br />\nrenaissance in popular music.<br />\nIn 1981, Willner invited some<br />\nof the world's finest jazz musicians to interpret the works of<br />\nNino Rota, the unheralded genius<br />\nbehind Federico Fellini's legendary film scores. \"Amarcord<br />\nNino Rota\"(Hannibal 9301) was<br />\nWillner's first \"various artists\"<br />\nconcept record, and the results<br />\nwere astonishing.<br />\nPianist Jaki Byard played<br />\ndazzling variations on the themes<br />\nto \"Amarcord\" and \"La<br />\nStrada.\" Soprano saxophone<br />\nwizard Steve Lacy contributed an<br />\nintense \"Roma,\" and Carla Bley<br />\nstitched together a riotous medley<br />\nof themes from Fellini's \"8 /<br />\n1<br />\n2.\"<br />\nThe album spurted colors and textures; it worked splendidly. From<br />\nten very different performances,<br />\nWillner constructed a cohesive<br />\nrecord with surprising longevity.<br />\nA genre was born.<br />\nThe Rota tribute was intended<br />\nto be a one-time project. Yet in<br />\n1984 A&amp;M Records released<br />\n\"That's the Way I Feel Now\"<br />\n(A&amp;M 6600), a salute to jazz<br />\ngiant Thelonious Monk. Willner<br />\nrecruited a protean roster of<br />\nmusicians to resuscitate classics<br />\nfrom Monk's preeminent<br />\nsongbook. Though the cast of<br />\nperformers was far more<br />\nvariegated than on \"Amarcord<br />\nNino Rota,\" their mission was no<br />\nless ambitious. As arranger and<br />\nsaxophonist John Zorn put it,<br />\nmusicians were expected to give<br />\ntheir own, original definitions to<br />\nwords people already knew.<br />\nThe output of German expatriate Kurt Weill appeared in<br />\nfresh guises on 1985's \"Lost In<br />\nthe Stars\" (A&amp;M 5104). Contributors ranged from the Armadillo String Quartet to Henry<br />\nThreadgill to Lou Reed, and each<br /><br />\nbizarre array of musicians to<br />\ndate. On the record, classic<br />\nAWAKE<br />\nDisney melodies are rendered in<br />\nmre<br />\n1,10*<br />\na kaleidoscopic range of settings<br />\nby the Replacements, Betty<br />\nCarter, Harry Nilsson, Suzanne<br />\nVega, NRBQ, Los Lobos, and a<br />\ndozen other artists, all in their<br />\nown styles. The effect is dizzying; the album plays like a wild<br />\nTechnicolor musical.<br />\nWillner later organized the<br />\ntrack forged Weill's melodies into<br />\nrecord into medleys to compenintriguing new shapes, with the<br />\nsate for the brevity of the songs.<br />\nessence of the music intact.<br />\nThe five medleys comprise<br />\nCritical response to the records<br />\nroughly common themes<br />\nenthusiastic<br />\nhighly<br />\nwas<br />\n(\"Pinocchio Theme,\" \"All Innoeach album outsold its<br />\ncent Children Had Better<br />\npredecessor.<br />\nBeware\") and further unity is<br />\nHal Willner had found an ideal<br />\nprovided by the gravelly-voiced<br />\nway to mine the rich deposits of<br />\nKen Nordine, who \"narrates\"<br />\nneglected 20th century music.<br />\nwith a tone both innocent and<br />\nFans of the composers heard the<br />\nominous\u2014classic Disney.<br />\ngreat works of Weill, Rota, and<br />\nEven without the works of a<br />\nMonk transfigured by a bold<br />\nsingle composer to provide its<br />\nassemblage of musicians.

Bowman was the<br />\npresident of Johns Hopkins from<br />\n1935 to 1948. He donated some<br />\nof his papers to MSE, including<br />\nsome of his letters from Peary.<br />\nHe died suddenly in 1950 without<br />\narranging for the disposition of<br />\nthe remainder of his documents.<br />\nSome were added to MSE's collection, but the rest went to<br />\nBowman's son, Robert. When<br />\nRobert Bowman retired in 1985<br />\nhe donated his father's papers to<br />\nMSE. Rawlins did some research<br />\n2<br />\nfor his book at the Special Collections Library in the early 70's.<br />\nHe returned to MSE in 1987 for<br />\nresearch in another area.

Some of<br />\nthe distances he claims to have<br />\ncovered in his records are inconsistent with his mode of travel.<br />\nHis expedition had four teams:<br />\ntwo teams went ahead to break<br />\nthe trail and build camps, and two<br />\nteams leapfrogged to the pole.<br />\nEach team carried supplies on<br />\n500-pound dogsleds, and the men<br />\nwalked alongside to help the dogs<br />\npull the sleds. In one two-day<br />\nperiod Peary's records would<br />\nhave him travel 130 miles. Most<br />\nof the experts of Peary's day were<br />\nconvinced that this was impossible, and accused him of falsifying his records.<br />\nAlthough Congressional hearings in 1910-1911 concluded that<br />\nPeary was the official discoverer<br />\nof the North Pole, the controversy persisted. In 1973, Rawlins<br />\npublished a landmark exposition<br />\nof the whole affair titled Peary at<br />\nthe North Pole: Fact or Fiction?<br />\nAfter exhaustive examination of<br />\nPeary's records, Rawlins found<br />\nseveral inconsistencies. Peary<br />\ntook readings of the sun's altitude<br />\nevery five days along the trek. At<br />\nthe poles, since they are the tips<br />\nof the earth's axis of rotation, the<br />\nsun does not appear to change<br />\naltitude above the horizon. During the Northern Hemisphere's<br />\nsummer, the sun never sets at the<br />\nNorth Pole, and never rises at the<br />\nSouth Pole.

No<br />\none knew these readings existed<br />\nisted. Geographers had assumed<br />\nthat Peary did not take readings<br />\nat the point he considered the<br />\nPole, and thus did not know he<br />\nhad missed. The readings showed that the sun's altitude was<br />\nchanging, which would not happen at the true pole. Peary would<br />\nhave known this, but no one on<br />\nhis crew would have known, and<br /><br />\nso he was able to perpetrate a<br />\nfraud. Peary gave these readings<br />\nto his wife Jo upon return from<br />\nthe Arctic, and told her to guard<br />\nthem with her life.<br />\nIn 1935, Marie Peary<br />\nremembered a list of numbers her<br />\nmother kept in a safe deposit box.<br />\nMarie made a copy of them to<br />\ngive to Bowman, who showed<br />\nthem to a friend and expert in<br />\nastronomical navigation, Harry<br />\nRaymond.Whether or not Raymond told Bowman about the<br />\nmeaning of these numbers is<br />\nunknown.

With<br />\nlucid details, Bosnak illustrates :<br />\npractical methods of dream<br />\nretrieval. In addition to his own<br />\ntheories, he describes Jungian<br />\nconcepts that have been applied<br />\nto dream interpretations.<br />\nJung was a long-time professional associate of Freud in<br />\nVictorian-era Vienna. Differences in personal relations and<br />\nin theoretical work eventually<br />\ndrove the two men apart. Freud<br />\nbelieved that Jung was trying to<br />\nusurp his authority and power,<br />\nand he conveyed this attitude to<br />\nJung. Jung found Freud's attitude<br />\nintolerable, and he disassociated<br />\nhimself from Freud.<br />\nBosnak's book is fascinating<br />\nbecause it suggests that portions<br />\nof both Freud's and Jung's<br />\ntheoretical work are compatible<br />\nin some settings. For example,<br />\nwhen Bosnak, a Jungian analyst,<br />\nengages in dreamwork, he utilizes<br />\nboth Freud's method of free<br />\nassociation and Jung's method of<br />\nactive imagination.<br />\nFree association, Bosnak<br />\nstates, is the relation of specific<br /><br />\ndream images to the real world<br />\nconcerns of the dreamer. Bosnak<br />\nrelates to the reader one of his<br />\nown dreams:<br />\n\"I am in a house under construction. There is a beautiful great<br />\nSaint Bernard dog, called Angie,<br />\nwho is being attacked by a<br />\nbulldog I have on a leash. The<br />\nbulldog bites Angie's neck,<br />\nholding her there, and they disappear together, engaged in a deadly fight.\"<br />\nBosnak then attempts to<br />\ndiscover the meaning of the<br />\ndream by reflection and free<br />\nassociation:<br />\n\"Angie, angel. I don't know any<br />\nAngie. I've never seen the dog<br />\nbefore, even though she was very<br />\nfamiliar to me in the dream.<br />\nAngie? Yes, of course! A long<br />\ntime ago. She sang like an angel.<br />\nAngel? My wife.. .anger with<br />\nher? My mother? My daughter?\"<br />\nBosnak finds these associations<br />\ninconclusive. He insists \"The<br />\nbattle between my rescuing guardian angel and the devouring bite<br />\nof the bulldog is far from over.\"<br />\nThis means that the same images<br />\nwill return to him in future<br />\ndreams. Since he is an analyst and<br />\nan expert at the recall of his own<br />\ndreams, he believes he will be<br />\nable to make sense out of a series<br /><br />\nof similar images.<br />\nBosnak provides practical<br />\nmemory exercises that are<br />\ndesigned to enhance dream recall.<br />\nHe insists these methods can<br />\nwork for anybody because<br />\neverybody dreams. One of the<br />\nmethods he presents is Jung's active imagination.<br />\nActive imagination is a method<br />\nthat Bosnak uses to \"continue\"<br />\na series of dreams.

With the<br />\nexception of a well-educated few,<br />\nthe public no longer cares.<br />\nThis loss of interest caused a<br />\ndecline in the quality of our national school system, with tragic<br />\nresults. According to the National<br />\nCommission on Excellence in<br />\napproximately<br />\nEducation,<br />\ntwenty-three million Americans<br />\nare functionally illiterate. Furthermore, scores on achievement<br />\ntests such as the SAT show an<br />\nalmost unbroken decline since the<br />\nearly 1960's. Even graduating<br />\ncollege students score lower on<br />\nachievement tests than in the past.<br />\nThis decay of American education causes problems for<br />\nemployers. Companies cannot<br />\ntrust an illiterate employee to use<br />\neven the simplest machinery.<br />\nWith the increasing use of high-<br /><br />\ntech equipment in manufacturing,<br />\nthe shortage of educated workers<br />\nwill become more pronounced.<br />\nThe first step in reforming our<br />\nschools is the introduction of<br />\ndiscipline back into the school<br />\nsystem. Drug sales, violence, and<br />\ngrade fixing (particularly evident<br />\nin athletic students) are criminal<br />\nand cannot be tolerated.<br />\nJoe Green was the principal of<br />\na school in New Jersey who successfully removed the criminals<br />\nresponsible for disrupting the<br />\nschool. He tolerated no infractions of the rules and used force<br />\nwhen necessary. He showed that<br />\ndiscipline is still effective.<br />\nThe second step is to improve<br />\nthe caliber of teachers. Higher<br />\nstandards must exist and greater<br />\nnumbers of qualified teachers<br />\nmust be brought into the school<br />\nsystem. To accomplish these<br />\ngoals, testing must be conducted<br />\nregularly to cull those who are<br />\nnot qualified. In addition, higher<br />\nsalaries must be introduced in<br />\norder to attract a more talented<br />\nstaff.<br />\nThe next step is allocation of<br />\ngreater government funds to<br />\neducation. This would necessitate<br />\neither an increase in taxation<br />\nwhich is an unattractive option or<br />\na reallocation of existing funds<br />\nfrom other government programs. More funding would permit the rise in salaries mentioned<br /><br />\nA basic handbook of'\u201411614$11W<br />\nJungian dr-eamwork<br /><br />\nabove. Also, the purchase of new<br />\nequipment such as computers,<br />\nnew textbooks, and facilities<br />\nwould become feasible.<br />\nThe last and probably most important step is to raise the public<br />\ninterest in education. To recreate<br />\na passion for knowledge and a<br />\ndesire for the best possible education is crucial in reforming the<br />\nschool system.<br />\nParents need to become more<br />\ninvolved in their children's<br />\nschooling. Conferences with<br />\nthat<br />\nchecking<br />\nteachers,<br />\nhomework is done, and helping at<br />\nthe school when needed are areas<br />\nin which parents must become involved before any improvement<br />\ncan occur.<br />\nThose of us fortunate enough to<br />\nhave received good educations<br />\nmust also help. We ought to take<br />\nthe lead in raising public<br />\nawareness, campaigning for<br />\nlegislation or tutoring students<br />\nwho need help. For Hopkins<br />\nstudents, a multitude of organizations exist to accomplish these<br />\nends. Join one. The Hopkins<br />\nTutorial Project is an excellent<br />\nopportunity to become involved.<br />\nThe students who come to the<br />\nprogram for help want to learn<br />\nand need people who care.<br />\nWhile Hopkins students are<br />\noften busy with their own studies,<br />\nsome opportunities to help do not<br />\nrequire a great time commitment.<br /><br />\nContest<br /><br />\nReadings<br />\nat Hopkins<br /><br />\n1989 Raymond Carver Short<br />\nStory Contest<br />\nEnglish Department<br />\nHumboldt State University<br />\nArcata, CA 95521<br /><br />\nJohn Hollander<br />\n8:00 p.m., Wed., Nov.2<br />\nThe Tudor and Stewart Room<br /><br />\nStories must be typed, no more<br />\nthan 25 pages, double spaced.<br />\nSend two copies, photocopies acceptable.

You remember those twins six<br />\nmonths ago that tried to strangle Sterling when they found out that he was<br />\nseeing each of them on alternating<br />\nnights. He pawned his gun for fifty<br />\ndollars after that. No more blood, he<br />\nsaid. Then a month later, there was<br />\nFiona, that thin anemic-looking girl who<br />\nhad her head cracked open by the<br />\nbowling ball in Sterling's kitchen cupboard (even a man can run out of closet<br />\nspace. What was it Sterling said she was<br />\nlooking for, oregano?). The two of you<br />\ndropped her in a dumpster behind<br />\nSears on Route 40. After them, all the<br />\nother accidents seemed unfortunate<br />\nchild's play, misplaced modifiers in the<br />\ngrammar that was Sterling Flynn's<br />\nlife.

Scott, the Director<br />\nof Athletics, affirmed, \"We<br />\ndefinitely know that there is a<br />\nneed for improved facilities; it is<br />\nacknowledged by the administration.\" Dr. Muller himself listed<br />\nin last May's graduation address<br />\nthat severa needs exist, and one<br />\nwas a new Athletic Center.<br />\nThe problem with the existing<br /><br />\nAthletic Center is that it is too<br />\nsmall to meet all the needs of the<br />\nstudents that use the building. It<br />\nwas built in 1965 for an all-male<br />\npopulation, and six years later,<br />\nwhen the University went co-ed,<br />\nthe women athletes were given a<br />\ncut-up and redesigned corner of<br />\nthe men's locker rooms, a lessthan-adequate space.<br />\nAnother problem connected<br />\nwith the lack of space is the need<br />\nfor more basketball court time for<br />\nrecreational usage. Between October and the end of February, the<br />\ncourts are used by the women's<br />\nvolleyball team, the two men's<br />\nbasketball teams, the women's<br />\nbasketball team, and the BIA<br />\n(volleyball, basketball, and badminton). Pick-up games are virtually impossible, as both gyms<br />\nare tied up for practically the<br />\nwhole winter.<br />\nThe only solution to the space<br />\nproblems is to build onto the<br />\nAthletic Center, as there is no<br />\nmore room to make changes<br />\nwithin the building. According to<br />\nScott, \"What we need is a whole<br />\nnew facility.\" A preliminary<br /><br />\nathletic staff meeting has already<br />\nbeen held this fall, and it identified about fifteen areas targeted<br />\nfor improvement. Additional<br />\nbasketball courts for casual play<br />\nand expanded locker room space<br />\nfor the women were named as top<br />\npriorities, but the staff would also<br />\nlike to add a new weight room,<br />\nmore racquetball and squash<br />\ncourts, improved dance facilities,<br />\nand more. An ideal situation<br />\nwould be the creation of a brand<br />\nnew fieldhouse, possibly built<br />\nbehind the Athletic Center where<br />\nROTC is located. The fieldhouse<br />\nwould have three to four combasketball/tenbination<br />\nnis/volleyball courts surrounded<br />\nby a 200 meter indoor track,<br />\nlocker rooms, and a weight room,<br />\nbut construction plans are not<br />\nslated for the immediate future.<br />\nThe next step is a committee<br />\nmeeting in late January, made up<br />\nof all constituents of the University, to present the desires for the<br />\nnew facility to the administration.<br />\n\"We're just scratching the surface this year,\" said Scott, \"but<br />\narchitectural drawings could be<br /><br />\nforthcoming soon.\"<br />\nThe last major student concern<br />\nhas been the general weight<br />\nroom, a situation that the University has recently been working on<br />\ncontinually. Since last spring,<br />\nHopkins has spent between<br />\n$4,000 and $5,000 on improvements for the weight room.<br />\nRecent purchases include a new<br />\nOlympic barbell set, twelve<br />\ndumbells, and two exercise<br />\nbicycles. The Athletic Center has<br />\njust received approval from Dean<br />\nColombo's office for the funds to<br />\ninstall a wall of mirrors along the<br />\nback wall of the weight room<br />\nbehind the free weights, and after<br />\nthat is looking to install an overhed ceiling fan to improve ventilation. Bob Scott has also contracted an outside firm to<br />\nperiodically monitor the condition<br />\nof the equipment, performing<br />\npreventative maintenance and<br />\nreplacing needed parts. The company is currently waiting for an<br />\nordered part to fix the broken<br />\nquadracep machine. Unfortunately, there is no more room in the<br />\ngeneral weight room for extra<br /><br />\nequipment because of safety.<br />\n\"We are very sensitive to the<br />\ncondition of the weight room,\"<br />\nScott stated.<br />\nAnother improvement to the<br />\nAthletic Center facilities is the<br />\nrenovation of the lower playing<br />\nfield, scheuled for next summer,<br />\nwhen the nearby construction on<br />\nthe new physics building is further along. \"Football, soccer,<br />\nand field hockey suffered on it all<br />\nfall,\" Scott said, \"and our Division I men's lacrosse team and<br />\nDivision III women's lacrosse<br />\nteam will have to suffer on it next<br />\nspring. There is no sense in fixing the field before that when<br />\ntrucks drive over it every day.\"<br />\nAll in all, the Administration,<br />\nand especially Bob Scott, seem to<br />\nbe sincerely interested in giving<br />\nthe students the improved athletic<br />\nfacilities that they need and want.<br />\nFunding is always going to be a<br />\nproblem, especially in the<br />\nendeavor of building a large<br />\nfacility. But, as Scott said, \"This<br />\nis a high powered University. It's<br />\ncoming, but just how soon we<br />\ndon't know.\"<br /><br />\n24/OCTOBER 28, 1988<br /><br />\nField hockey eliminated from MAC playoffs<br />\nby Laura Perlinn<br /><br />\nThe women's field hockey<br />\nteam ended their season on a sad<br />\nnote this week, losing to Gettysburg 2-0 last Friday in a playoff for the MAC Southwest section title and losing to Lebanon<br />\nValley 2-1 last Monday in the<br />\nfirst round of the MAC playoffs.<br />\nIn the loss at Gettysburg, their<br />\nsecond of the season, the Jays<br />\nplayed well enough to win but<br /><br />\ncouldn't capitalize on any scoring<br />\nopportunities.

The<br />\nJays controlled the last ten<br />\nminutes of the game, and almost<br />\ntied it, when with one minute left,<br />\nFatula shot the ball past the<br />\ngoalie, but the goal was called<br />\nback because a Hopkins forward<br />\nhad been offsides.

In the halfcourse match, Hopkins scored<br />\n1970 to Princeton's 1667.<br /><br />\nOnce again, junior Jim<br />\nKielkopf was Hopkins' leading<br />\nshooter, firing 60 shots for 516<br />\npoints out of 600. At one point<br />\nearly in the match, Coach Sam<br />\nHardy believed that Hopkins' victory was in jeopardy when he<br />\nreceived mistaken information<br /><br />\nabout a shooter, but this proved<br />\nto be quite false. The strong<br />\nshowing by Hopkins junior Larry<br />\nYoung, however, is what sealed<br />\nPrinceton's fate. Young fired his<br />\npersonal best, putting pressure on<br />\nPrinceton's top shooters to catch<br />\nup. Princeton's concentration was<br /><br />\nbroken, and they fired a dismal<br />\ncourse, with only one of their<br />\nmarksmen displaying a score<br />\ncomparable to the Hopkins sharpshooters' performances. Also firing for Hopkins: senior Neil Seidman,junior Matthew Mayr, and<br />\nsophomore Matt Fischer.<br /><br />\nGuaranteed<br />\nLowest<br />\nFares!!<br /><br />\nJHU ...
