We interviewed Bridgers and received the emphatic reply that he was not contemplating a change and went<br />\nso far as to say,\"As long as I am coach we will not change.\"<br />\nBridgers stated that there was no significance in the<br />\nfreshmen using the \"Split-T\" but that he had asked Scott,<br />\nthe frosh coach, to use it so that the Varsity would have a<br />\n\"Split-T\" team to scrimmage, for most of Hopkins' opponents<br />\nare \"Split-T\" teams.<br />\nBridgers went on to point out that he felt that it was foolish to blame the lack of success of the team on the formation.<br />\nDisappointing Performance<br />\n<br />\nWe then asked why the team was having a hard time in<br />\nits first three games and we received a multitude of answers.<br />\n\"I was very disappointed with the performance of the team<br />\nfor we played poorer than in pre-season practice,\" was one.<br />\nWhy this has occurred Bridgers found hard to answer.<br />\nThe causes might include studies, lack of confidence, rushing,<br />\nand other school activities.<br />\nAnother reason given for the losing record is the quality<br />\nof the opposition. \"I feel that we have improved over last<br />\nyear, but our opponents have also. How can we expect our<br />\nboys to play, on even terms, teams that have four-year veterans which outweigh us by twenty-pounds a man. Actual<br />\nplaying weights of our line from end to end is less than 180pounds and only seven of the twenty-odd juniors and seniors<br />\non the team have had three-years experience,\" stated Bridgers.<br />\nA third point which Bridgers brought up was the attitude on campus toward football. \"The boys make many sacrifices to play football and what reward do they get for it?<br />\nThen they have to practice every day after classes and get<br />\nknocked around. What do they get for it, practically nothing.<br />\nThe few people that do show up for the games seem to come<br />\nthere to laugh at the guys as they get battered around.<br />\nThus coach Bridgers endeavored to give some of the<br />\nanswers to why the team is not posting a better won and loss<br />\nrecord. We sympathize with him and especially with the boys<br />\nwho are really making sacrifices, but we have some reasons<br />\nof our own which, because of space limitations, will have to<br />\nwait for the next edition of the Jay's Nest.<br />\n<br />\nStill looking for its first victory<br />\nof the football campaign, Johr<br />\nHopkins varsity gridders take on<br />\nthe Randolph-Macon Yellow Jackets tomorrow afternoon at two<br />\no'clock on Homewood Field.<br />\nThe Blue Jays, in spite of losing their first three games, will<br />\nbe trying to settle an old grievance<br />\nwith the Jackets, who are considered by Bridgers to be a very<br />\nstrong eleven. The Jays haven't<br />\ntopped a Randolph-Macon squad<br />\nsince the start of the present series in 1950, and in addition the<br />\ncoach is anxious to have his boys<br />\navenge last year's 27-0 shutout at<br />\nthe hands of the Jackets.<br />\nAccording to Bridgers, Hopkins<br />\nwill be going into the game with<br />\na fairly strong team. Backs Jack<br />\nLawrence and Barry Wood are<br />\nready to see spot duty, although<br />\nthe bench will still be somewhat<br />\nweakened by the absence of John<br />\nForte, who is out with a dislocated<br />\nshoulder.<br />\nJackets Win Three<br />\nRandolph-Macon will be coming<br />\ninto the fray at full strength and<br />\nwith a 3-1-1 log. Bernard Pinchbeck, playing his fourth year for<br />\nthe Jackets, is leading the returning lettermen. Pinchbeck, who<br />\nlast year won the Virginia AllLittle-Seven honors and was given<br />\nHonorable Mention on the Little<br />\nAll-American Football team, averaged 6.9 yards a carry last year<br />\nand has scored a total of 66 points<br />\nin two seasons.<br />\nAt the other halfback post is<br />\nfive-foot, eight-inch, 155-pound<br />\nCharley Nuttycombe, who is also<br />\nplaying his last year for the Jackets. Quarterbacking the team<br />\nwill be Phil Coppag, playing his<br />\nthird year in that slot.

We interviewed Bridgers and received the emphatic reply that he was not contemplating a change and went<br />\nso far as to say,\"As long as I am coach we will not change.\"<br />\nBridgers stated that there was no significance in the<br />\nfreshmen using the \"Split-T\" but that he had asked Scott,<br />\nthe frosh coach, to use it so that the Varsity would have a<br />\n\"Split-T\" team to scrimmage, for most of Hopkins' opponents<br />\nare \"Split-T\" teams.<br />\nBridgers went on to point out that he felt that it was foolish to blame the lack of success of the team on the formation.<br />\nDisappointing Performance<br /><br />\nWe then asked why the team was having a hard time in<br />\nits first three games and we received a multitude of answers.<br />\n\"I was very disappointed with the performance of the team<br />\nfor we played poorer than in pre-season practice,\" was one.<br />\nWhy this has occurred Bridgers found hard to answer.<br />\nThe causes might include studies, lack of confidence, rushing,<br />\nand other school activities.<br />\nAnother reason given for the losing record is the quality<br />\nof the opposition. \"I feel that we have improved over last<br />\nyear, but our opponents have also. How can we expect our<br />\nboys to play, on even terms, teams that have four-year veterans which outweigh us by twenty-pounds a man. Actual<br />\nplaying weights of our line from end to end is less than 180pounds and only seven of the twenty-odd juniors and seniors<br />\non the team have had three-years experience,\" stated Bridgers.<br />\nA third point which Bridgers brought up was the attitude on campus toward football. \"The boys make many sacrifices to play football and what reward do they get for it?<br />\nThen they have to practice every day after classes and get<br />\nknocked around. What do they get for it, practically nothing.<br />\nThe few people that do show up for the games seem to come<br />\nthere to laugh at the guys as they get battered around.<br />\nThus coach Bridgers endeavored to give some of the<br />\nanswers to why the team is not posting a better won and loss<br />\nrecord. We sympathize with him and especially with the boys<br />\nwho are really making sacrifices, but we have some reasons<br />\nof our own which, because of space limitations, will have to<br />\nwait for the next edition of the Jay's Nest.<br /><br />\nStill looking for its first victory<br />\nof the football campaign, Johr<br />\nHopkins varsity gridders take on<br />\nthe Randolph-Macon Yellow Jackets tomorrow afternoon at two<br />\no'clock on Homewood Field.<br />\nThe Blue Jays, in spite of losing their first three games, will<br />\nbe trying to settle an old grievance<br />\nwith the Jackets, who are considered by Bridgers to be a very<br />\nstrong eleven. The Jays haven't<br />\ntopped a Randolph-Macon squad<br />\nsince the start of the present series in 1950, and in addition the<br />\ncoach is anxious to have his boys<br />\navenge last year's 27-0 shutout at<br />\nthe hands of the Jackets.<br />\nAccording to Bridgers, Hopkins<br />\nwill be going into the game with<br />\na fairly strong team. Backs Jack<br />\nLawrence and Barry Wood are<br />\nready to see spot duty, although<br />\nthe bench will still be somewhat<br />\nweakened by the absence of John<br />\nForte, who is out with a dislocated<br />\nshoulder.<br />\nJackets Win Three<br />\nRandolph-Macon will be coming<br />\ninto the fray at full strength and<br />\nwith a 3-1-1 log. Bernard Pinchbeck, playing his fourth year for<br />\nthe Jackets, is leading the returning lettermen. Pinchbeck, who<br />\nlast year won the Virginia AllLittle-Seven honors and was given<br />\nHonorable Mention on the Little<br />\nAll-American Football team, averaged 6.9 yards a carry last year<br />\nand has scored a total of 66 points<br />\nin two seasons.<br />\nAt the other halfback post is<br />\nfive-foot, eight-inch, 155-pound<br />\nCharley Nuttycombe, who is also<br />\nplaying his last year for the Jackets. Quarterbacking the team<br />\nwill be Phil Coppag, playing his<br />\nthird year in that slot.
