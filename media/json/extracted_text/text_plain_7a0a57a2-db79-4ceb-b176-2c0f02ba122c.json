Neou, a<br />\nsurvivor of Cambodia's \"Killing<br />\nFields.\"<br />\nFrelick spoke of his volunteer<br />\nwork through Amnesty on behalf<br />\nof refugees worldwide, and Neou<br />\ndescribed his experiences as a<br />\nrefugee from the Khmer Rouge<br />\nregime.<br />\nFrelick first became involved<br />\nwith refugee work as a member<br />\nof his college Amnesty International group. Eventually, he came<br />\ninto contact with more and more<br />\nrefugees as an Amnesty volunteer<br />\nand decided to specialize in<br />\nrefugee work. Frelick stressed<br />\nthat \"human rights are my main<br />\nconcern, as opposed to the social<br />\nwork approach to refugees.\"<br />\nFrelick distingushed a refugee<br />\nfrom an \"economic migrant\":<br />\n\"Refugees are from different<br />\nracial, economic, religious, and<br />\nideological backgrounds, but they<br />\nall share a common fear of<br />\npersecution and gross human<br />\nrights abuse upon return to their<br />\nrespective homelands. That is<br />\nwhy they fled in the first place,<br />\nnot for a better economic life, but<br />\nin many cases, to protect their<br />\nlives.<br />\nIn 1980, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was<br />\namended to clarify the definition<br />\nof a refugee as \"a person with<br />\nwell-founded fear of persecution<br />\nupon return to his or her former<br />\ncountry on the basis of race,<br />\nreligion, nationality, political opi-<br />\n<br />\nnion, or membership in a social<br />\norganization.<br />\nInternational law prohibits<br />\ndeporting anyone to a country<br />\nwhere he or she risks being<br />\npersecuted.

Often, the airline ticket<br />\nteller, who must determine<br />\nwhether the<br />\nprospective<br />\nemigrants have proper travel<br />\npapers, denies refugees the permission to leave.<br />\nThe U.S. frequently interdicts<br />\nrefugees at its borders.

A refugee is forever<br />\nspiritually dislokated.\" Refugees<br />\nshould never be repatriated<br />\ninvoluntarily.<br />\nFrelick emphasized that \"the<br />\nU.S. [Department of Immigration] tends to be xenophobic<br />\ntoward Third World and Middle<br />\nEast refugees. Sometimes [as in<br />\nthe case of an Iranian refugee] it<br />\ntakes slashing one's wrists to prove the fear for one's life is real.\"<br />\nAccording to Frelick, Amnes-<br />\n<br />\nty refugee workers seek to insure<br />\na fair asylum hearing for each<br />\nrefugee to determine whether the<br />\nrefugee faces the danger of violations of his or her human rights<br />\nif the refugee returns to the home<br />\ncountry.<br />\nNeou's recounting of his experiences as a refugee from Cambodia's \"killing fields\" in 1979<br />\nadded a distinctly personal<br />\nperspective to the program.

His Rutgers data<br />\nshowed that the average freshman<br />\nwill count a third of his dormmates as friends within two<br />\nmonths.

He did not claim that<br />\nhis findings at Rutgers were entirely typical of American modern<br />\ncollege life nationwide, but he<br />\nbelieved that his research does<br />\nreveal certain dynamics. He<br />\nstressed the fact that his<br />\nmethodology was based on student rekponses. \"It is hard to<br />\nremember the serious reason for<br />\nbeing in college,\" he said.<br />\nIn response to Rosser's<br />\ncriticism, Moffatt suggested a<br />\nplayful use of the term Neanderthal in relation to fraternity<br />\nmembers, while maintaining that<br />\nstudents at Rutgers had reported<br />\nbehavior in keeping with this<br />\ndescription.

The fact is most<br />\nstudents do have enough time but<br />\ndo not know how to use it. \"How<br />\nTo Do It All\" was the topic<br />\ndiscussed by Chaplain Gretchen<br />\nVan Utt in Tuesday's Brown Bag<br />\nLunch lecture.<br />\nThe Chaplain designated four<br />\ncategories in which people spend<br />\ntheir time. In an average week,<br />\none spends approximately 11<br />\nhours on meals, 49 hours on<br />\nsleep, 20 hours on studying, and<br />\n19 hours in classes and labs.<br />\nAmazingly, that leaves 69 hours<br />\nthat are unaccounted for. If one<br />\ndesignated 20 hours for work or<br />\nextracurricular activities, that still<br />\nleaves over 40 hours per week of<br />\nfree, or flexible time.<br />\nFor those who still feel constrained by the lack of time, Van<br />\nUtt illustrated two ways of gaining time: 1) Learn to use small<br />\nblocks of time, like the period<br />\nbetween classes; or 2) Work<br />\nmore efficiently in the available<br />\ntime limit.<br />\nVan Utt described scheduling<br />\nas the key to time management.<br />\n\"If you write down what you<br />\nplan to do, then you are more<br />\nlikely to accomplish it.\" The first<br />\nstep in scheduling is long-range<br />\nplanning.<br />\nA monthly activity calendar<br />\nshould outline assignments along<br />\nwith major personal goals, such<br />\nas learning a new art, participating in a new sport, or losing weight. Including these objectives in long-term planning is important because otherwise one<br />\nloses sight of the original<br />\nincentive.<br />\nThe next step is to arrange a<br />\nweekly activity schedule. This<br />\nschedule should primarily contain<br />\nfixed activities such as classes and<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe third schedule is a list of<br />\npriorities for each day. Schedul-<br />\n<br />\ning eliminates the need to hold<br />\neverything in one's mind and<br />\nhelps one feel more secure. The<br />\nmore in control one feels, the<br />\nlower one's stress level.<br />\nVan Utt went on to give advice<br />\nabout how to make the most out<br />\nof study time. She advised against<br />\ntrying to study four or five hours<br />\nat a time. Studying at a stretch induces loss of concentration.<br />\nWhen one does have a lot of<br />\nstudy time, Van Utt suggested<br />\ntaking 5 to 10 minute breaks<br />\nevery 40 to 50 minutes. \"It's<br />\ncrucial to pre-plan your breaks.<br />\nYou have to allow your brain<br />\ntime to absorb information,\" explained Van Utt. Recall ability of<br />\nreading material can drop to 30<br />\npercent after prolonged, interrupted studying from a peak of 75<br />\npercent. Also, Van Utt pointed<br />\nout that \"taking a break\" meant<br />\nphysically leaving the work site.<br />\nVan Utt stressed the importance of previewing reading<br />\nmaterial. \"Preview\" means to<br />\nread the title, the subheadings, the<br />\nintroduction, the conclusion, and<br />\nthe first sentence of each<br />\nparagraph. Previewing, Van Utt<br />\nsuggested, should be done before<br />\nand after reading the assigned<br />\nmaterial. It is also an effective<br />\nway of studying for an exam.<br />\nWhile previewing, one should<br />\nformulate questions about the<br />\nreading material and relate it to<br />\npreviously learned material.<br />\n\"Your brain can be considered<br />\na series of hooks and the key to<br />\nassimilating information is to link<br />\neverything,\" explained Van Utt.<br />\nTo retain this information, constant review is essential. Van Utt<br />\nrecommended that lecture notes<br />\nbe reviewed after a lecture as<br />\nsoon as possible and also one<br />\nweek later and again one month<br />\nafter.<br />\nShe discouraged combining<br />\nstudying with other activities such<br />\nas as eating and listening to music<br />\nand encouraged studying during<br />\ndaylight hours, instead of late at<br />\nnight.<br />\n<br />\n\"So she was forced to either<br />\na)sleep at a fraternity house b)get<br />\nraped on the way home or c)ride<br />\nhome with a drunk.\"<br />\nAccording to an employee of<br />\nthe security department, the large<br />\nnumber of calls after two o'clock<br />\nprompted the change in policy.<br />\n\"I've seen what these guys do<br />\nlate at night, they don't do<br />\nanything but drive around campus and check doors,\" one person said.

With the frightening frequency with which Hopkins students are mugged or assaulted<br />\nwithin and without this circle, it is obvious that walking<br />\nhome, for both men and women, is not a logical choice.<br />\nWhat is a logical choice, however, is for the University<br />\nto provide students with a safe means of transportation,<br />\nsince it is the University's lack of housing that forces<br />\nstudents to live off campus in the first place.<br />\nThe escort van does manage to ferry significant numbers<br />\nof students around, but lately, safety seems to be taking<br />\na back seat to laziness.

The numerous complaints about the shuttle not accepting calls before the 2 a.m. deadline, when<br />\ntaken in conjunction with an overall need for a later<br />\ndeadline, illustrates that escort van policies need to be reexamined.

A<br />\nfew years ago it sailed around the<br />\nAtlantic from city to city, trying<br />\nto find a place to dump its load<br />\nof trash, getting rejected at one<br />\nport after another.<br />\nThe basic problem that caused<br />\nthe incident hasn't gone away yet:<br />\nthere's still too much trash.<br />\nThere's too much trash already<br />\naround, and there's too much<br />\ntrash being produced. There's so<br />\nmuch, in fact, that we're running<br />\nout of places to put it. Landfills<br />\nare closing at an astronomic rate.<br />\nAnd that's where recycling comes<br />\ninto play.<br />\nBelieve it or not, almost<br />\nanything can be recycled. All that<br />\nneeds to be put in is a little time<br />\nand effort. Aluminum can be<br />\nmelted down and reused. Glass<br />\ntoo is reusable\u2014it is sorted by<br />\ncolor, melted, and used in new<br />\nproducts. Just take a look at<br />\nCharles Street\u2014all that glitters is<br />\nrecycled glass.<br />\nPapers are another item that is<br />\neasy to recycle, newspapers<br />\nespecially. Used oil is collected,<br />\nre-refined and used again.\"Tin\"<br />\ncans, plastic, and batteries are<br />\nalso collected and recycled,<br />\nalthough to recycle these takes a<br />\nlittle more work and is a more<br />\ndifficult process. There are<br />\nothers, too\u2014the above are just a<br />\nfew of the most commonly<br />\nrecycled materials.<br />\nThere are four main factors that<br />\nmake recycling such a key issue.<br />\nOne is the energy that recycling<br />\nsaves\u2014reusing materials versus<br />\nremaking them. In the case of the<br />\naluminum above, 94 percent of<br />\nthe energy it would take to make<br />\nnew cans is saved by recycling<br />\nthem.<br />\nA second major concern is the<br />\nspace that is saved in terms of<br />\ntrash volume. Recycling pulls<br />\nwhat would be trash out of cir-<br />\n<br />\nculation, reuses it, and puts it<br />\nback into circulation anew. If<br />\nsomething is just thrown away, it<br />\ncan take up a lot of space\u2014<br />\nespecially substances like plastics<br />\nor cans.<br />\nThird, there is the fact that<br />\nrecycling preserves the environment. If you recycle paper, not<br />\nonly do you save landfill space,<br />\nthus preserving land for other<br />\nuses, but you also reduce the need<br />\nto cut down more trees, which in<br />\nturn saves forests and prevents<br />\nsoil erosion. Recycling something<br />\nmeans that you cut down on<br />\npollution and other undesi: able<br />\neffects like ground-water<br />\nleeching.<br />\nFinally, there is simple<br />\neconomics. By recycling<br />\neverybody saves money, both the<br />\nproducers in lower manufacturing costs, and the consumer in<br />\nlower prices. Many recycling<br />\nplants also offer money for bringing in materials. For example,<br />\nglass pays at 2 cents per pound,<br />\naluminum at around 30 cents per<br />\npound and higher. Recycling<br />\nmakes sense for the pocket as<br />\nwell as for the environment.<br />\nPeople have come up with a<br />\nvariety of answers beside recycling. None of these, however, are<br />\neither as effective or as permanent as recycling itself.<br />\nOne of the more popular ideas<br />\nis incinerators. However, these<br />\npotentially create more of a problem than they solve.<br />\nAlthough they burn the trash,<br />\nthey hardly get rid of it. All they<br />\nreally end up doing is reducing<br />\nthe trash volume. The problem<br />\nremains, only now the pollutants<br />\nand toxins are concentrated in the<br />\nash that is left over. Also, some<br />\nof the toxins escape into the atmosphere as air pollution, further<br />\ncomplicating the issue.<br />\nLandfills too are an answer that<br />\npeople have come up with. If<br />\nanything, they too only corn-<br />\n<br />\nplicate the issue. The substances<br />\nthat go into them are often potent<br />\ntoxins. In addition, landfills fill<br />\nup quickly and take a very, very<br />\nlong time to decay completely.<br />\nPerhaps worst, they are<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nAs Dale Hargrave, a volunteer<br />\nfor the CPHA (one of the leading<br />\nanti-pollution organizations in<br />\nBaltimore), says, \"In many cases<br />\nno one is even certain what is in<br />\nthe landfills. If one of them ever<br />\ncaught fire, or was set on fire,<br />\nthere would be a major problem.<br />\nIt would have to be handled much<br />\nas a chemical spill or nuclear accident is.\"<br />\nDespite the fact that recycling<br />\nhas so many advantages, people<br />\nevery day across the world throw<br />\naway items that are recyclable.<br />\nOrganizations like the CPHA<br />\nhave a hard time making people<br />\nlisten, especially in a city like<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nPeople act as if there's no need<br />\nto conserve what we have. To<br />\nthem it's just trash, not potential<br />\nmaterials or money. Perhaps it's<br />\ndue to ignorance. At least that<br />\nsounds better than the fact that<br />\nthey plain don't care.<br />\nPerhaps the whole issue is best<br />\nsummed up by the comment of<br />\nLora Hall of the Baltimore<br />\nResource Journal when she said<br />\nthat \"of all things, recycling is<br />\none of the ones that will literally<br />\nmake or break our future.\"<br />\nIf you are interested in recycling and wish to get involved, Lora<br />\nHall is interested in hearingfrom<br />\nyou at either 339-7716 or<br />\n337-5525.

Recently, Mayor<br />\nSchmoke announced that the city would begin initiating recycling efforts and October was<br />\ndeclared \"Recycling Month\" in<br />\nBaltimore. So, what exactly is the<br />\ncity doing?<br />\nIf Baltimore were to change its<br />\nslogan to \"The City That<br />\nRecycles,\" it would be a<br />\nmisnomer. Baltimore Magazine's<br />\nNovember issue ran an article<br />\ndealing with recycling and posed the question, \"Would<br />\nBaltimore be the last city in<br />\nAmerica to recycle?\"<br />\nThe city's efforts so far have<br />\nreally only amounted to the<br />\n\"Roll-off Program.\" This program calls for locating recycling<br />\nreceptacles in Baltimore<br />\nneighborhoods. These receptacles<br />\nare a sort of dumpster with different compartments for different<br />\nmaterials such as aluminum,<br />\npaper, and glass.<br />\nThe plan first got under way in<br />\nthe community of Overlea last<br />\nweek, on November 3rd. This<br />\nweek, three new dumpsters will<br />\n<br />\nbe sited, one to be located at the<br />\nFarmer's Market on 32nd Street<br />\nin Waverly. The proceeds which<br />\ncome from this effort will be put<br />\ntoward tree-planting in and<br />\naround the community.<br />\nThose concerned with the<br />\nrecycling efforts in Baltimore do<br />\nnot think this is enough. Matt<br />\nShaps, the recycling coordinator<br />\nfor Students for Environmental<br />\nAction, says, \"Baltimore is doing very little to promote recycling.\"<br />\nOff-campus sources concur.<br />\n\"The Roll-off Program is a token<br />\nmove, and not really too much of<br />\nan effort,\" says Anneke Davis,<br />\npresident of the Baltimore Environmental Center.<br />\nRobert Pollard, of the Citizens'<br />\nPlanning and Housing Association (CPHA), agrees. \"It's a<br />\nuseful interim step to encourage<br />\nneighborhoods to recycle, but its<br />\nhardly a total solution.\"<br />\nRecycling efforts have been<br />\nlargely done by private organizations rather than the city. The<br />\nCPHA is the recognized leader of<br />\nthe recycling effort in Baltimore,<br />\nhandling everything from public<br />\nawareness to government proposals on how to deal with the<br />\nrecycling efforts. Pollard. who<br />\nreceived his masters degree<br />\n<br />\nsocial relations from Hopkins in<br />\n1972, is the co-chair of the<br />\nCPHA recycling committee.<br />\nThe CPHA was founded in<br />\n1941 to focus citizen participation<br />\nin city affairs. Early issues with<br />\nwhich it dealt were such things as<br />\nzoning regulations, city planning,<br />\nand education. It sponsors the City Series, a program which<br />\nfocuses attention on important<br />\nissues relevant to the Baltimore<br />\ncommunity. The next installment<br />\nof this series will begin this week,<br />\non November 15th, dealing with<br />\nregional issues in and around<br />\nBaltimore. It is also responsible<br />\nfor the \"Shape-Up Baltimore\"<br />\ncontest to encourage communities<br />\nto clean up and collect trash.<br />\nThe recycling committee was<br />\nformed in September of 1988 due<br />\nto a new interest in the environment. The purpose is primarily to<br />\nconsolidate efforts.<br />\n\"If you're collecting, and your<br />\nneighbors are collecting, why not<br />\nget together with them?\" asks<br />\nPollard. \"No one is opposed to<br />\nit\u2014its only a matter of making it<br />\neasy and practical to do.\"<br />\nPollard is pleased with some of<br />\nthe steps which some divisions of<br />\nBaltimore have taken, inSee BAl TI<br />\n<br />\nWI 0<br />\n<br />\nJIM groups begin recycling on campus<br />\nby Kathleen Curry<br />\n<br />\nScott Needle<br />\n<br />\nThis man will pay you for your trash.<br />\n<br />\nrecycling committee, says that<br />\naluminum should be regarded as<br />\nEnvironmental problems used \"a valuable resource.\" Furtherto be something we just, read more, as he explains, mining the<br />\nabout in magazines. \"Ozone ore required to make aluminum<br />\ndepletion\" and \"acid rain\u2022' releases oxides into the atseemed foreign and their solu- mosphere which contribute to<br />\ntions inaccessible.

While many critics, including the<br />\nrecently deceased Virgil Thomson, dismissed him<br />\nshallow<br />\nwho<br />\nperformer<br />\nas<br />\na<br />\naimed only to wow his audience, no one has denied<br />\nthat his mastery of the instrument in technical<br />\nterms has not been surpassed.<br />\nHorowitz was born in Kiev on October 1, 1904.<br />\nAlthough he was trained on the piano from early<br />\nin his youth, his first serious plans leaned toward<br />\na career in composition. It was not until the<br />\nRevolution of 1917 that Horowitz, at the tender<br />\nage of thirteen, was forced to perform frequently<br />\nto earn money for his devastated family.<br />\nHorowitz's yearnings to compose were never<br />\nsquelched by his fame as a pianist, however. His<br />\nmany arrangements, particularly that of Sousa's<br />\n\"Stars and Stripes Forever,\" could be heard as<br />\nencores at his recitals. To the horror of musical<br />\npurists, Horowitz even altered such standards as<br />\nMussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition,\"<br />\nRachmaninoffs \"Piano Sonata no. 2,\" and Liszt's<br />\n\"Mephisto Waltz.\" His response to accusations<br />\nof distorting the music was that he was only peeling away dead material to set free the feeling in<br />\nthe music. \"Mussorgsky was a bit of a dilettante,<br />\nand he was not really a pianist,\" argued Horowitz<br />\nin a 1984 interview. \"The piano is a very funny<br />\ninstrument. You have to know it well.\" That<br />\n<br />\n.M0<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nHorowitz knew the piano more intimately than<br />\nMussorgsky can hardly be refuted.<br />\nThe traditions of the Russian school of pianism,<br />\na movement which stemmed from the teachings<br />\nof Anton Rubinstein (1829-1894), could be<br />\nobserved in the Horowitz style. Critic Harold<br />\nSchoenberg labeled the Russian approach as one<br />\nof \"mood projection.\"<br />\nWhile Horowitz's technical ability enabled him<br />\nto create moments of incredible velocity and<br />\nvolume, he was not limited to bravura playing.<br />\nAfter a subtle program of Scarlatti, Mozart, and<br />\nSchumann, one admirer was heard to say, \"He<br />\nis the only pianist who can play colors.\"<br />\nWith such a mixture of nuance in sound and virtuosity, Horowitz was a prime model for imitation. But unlike Liszt, whose playing and teaching<br />\nformed an enduring school of pianism that can be<br />\ntraced to the present day, his style was unique and<br />\nultimately unteachable. His method used flat<br />\nfingers and a flat hand, a position strongly<br />\ndiscouraged in modern piano pedagogy. It was<br />\npartly due to this strange but effective personal<br />\ntrait that Horowitz was never really known as a<br />\nteacher.<br />\nSometimes criticized for his limited repertoire,<br />\nHorowitz was nevertheless a champion in the<br />\n\u2022 music of some previously lesser-known composers. He was instrumental in reviving the piano<br />\nsonatas of Muzio Clementi, and was also a fine<br />\ninterpreter of Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas. During World War II, he premiered the sixth, seventh,<br />\nand eighth sonatas of Sergei Prokofiev in the<br />\nUnited States. In fact, the seventh and eighth<br />\nsonatas were performed at the Russian Consulate;<br />\n<br />\nsuch interest was sparked that in the front rows<br />\nHorowitz observed Arturo Toscanini, Bruno<br />\nWalter, Leonard Bernstein, Samuel Barber, and<br />\nAaron Copland.<br />\nPerhaps his greatest contribution was his playing, of Russian composer Alexander Scriabin's<br />\nmusic. Horowitz described Scriabin as \"supersensuous, super-romantic, and super-mysterious.\"<br />\nThe Horowitz temperament suited this music<br />\nperfectly, and it is no surprise that his technique<br />\nwas agreeable to Scriabin's music\u2014the composer<br />\nhimself was a fine pianist, once described as \"an<br />\nelegant, light-fingered pianist gifted with a fluent<br />\ntechnique.\" Due to Horowitz's commitment to<br />\nthis music, Scriabin's sonatas are now staples in<br />\nthe international concert repertoire.<br />\nBut Horowitz was not always playing off the<br />\ntrodden path. His American debut, at Carnegie<br />\nHall in 1928, was with a standard war horse,<br />\nTchaikovsky's \"Piano Concerto no. 1.\" \"I chose<br />\nthe Tchaikovsky,\" he said later, \"because I knew<br />\nthat I could make such a wild sound, and I could<br />\nplay it with such speed and noise.\" So much for<br />\nmusicality and subtle nuance! Horowitz continued,<br />\n<br />\n\"I wanted to eat the public alive; to drive them<br />\ncompletely crazy.\" He certainly began his<br />\nAmerican career with a bang: when conductor<br />\nThomas Meecham's tempo became too moderate<br />\nfor Horowitz to show off, he simply erupted on<br />\nhis own, leaving the orchestra behind in a cloud<br />\nof what one critic called \"smoke from the keys.\"<br />\nThe impression was long-lasting, and persuasive<br />\nenough to ingratiate him with such pianists as<br />\nRachmaninoff, Hoffman, Schnabel, Lhevinne,<br />\nGieseking, and Backhaus, all of whom were in<br />\nattendance.<br />\nWhile Horowitz was never what could be<br />\ndescribed as an intellectual pianist, he nonetheless<br />\nmaintained some musical integrity. His words \"I<br />\nwill not return if I cannot play my best for the<br />\npublic\" shed light on his several sabbatical<br />\nperiods, one of which lasted three years. He certainly was out to wow the public, and he did.<br />\nHarold Schonberg summed it up best: \"No pianist<br />\nof the day brought such sheer, incandescent excitement to the concert platform, and none was<br />\nmore of a legend.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhen they aren't busy mucking around as moral<br />\ndegenerates, the boys bake chickens for a living<br />\nin their father's restaurant. The way those nutty<br />\nMcDermott boys toss those raw chickens around,<br />\nit's a surprise that the place hasn't been closed<br />\ndown by the health department.<br />\nFather knows best, however, and Jake McDermott(Jim Haynie) has the last laugh. He sells the<br />\nrestaurant out from under his inept sons, muttering about his imminent demise. The whispers of<br />\n\"not wanting to die cooking chickens\" sail way<br />\nover the heads of his dull-witted sons, but the audience can't miss the signal. Even if it is predictable, at least \"Staying Together\" tries to make<br />\nsense: without a restaurant to keep them together,<br />\ntheir father's death registers and gives the boys<br />\na foil for the second half of the film.<br />\nAs the boys react to the leveling of the restaurant<br />\nwith emotions ranging from blind outrage to ignorant outrage, it's difficult not to side with the<br />\nfather. Jake may be a wimp and allow his kids<br />\nto run all over him, but at least he's not stupid.<br />\nUnfortunately, watching the fabulous McDermott<br />\nboys run the restaurant into the ground would have<br />\nmade \"Staying Together\" much better, if oddly<br />\ncomic.<br />\nEven their mother Eileen (Melinda Dillon) admits that each of her three sons seems to have a<br />\nthird of a brain. At one point she cheerily reminds<br />\n<br />\nthem to have a good supper, and then adds,<br />\n\"Eat!\" It's as if they wouldn't be sure what to<br />\ndo when the food was placed before them. Eileen<br />\nMcDermott probably had to put \"inhale\" and<br />\n\"exhale\" signs over her sons' beds when they<br />\nwere little.<br />\n\"Staying Together\" is a failure because the t<br />\ncharacters aren't smart enough to do anything<br />\nunanticipated. Love may transcend stupidity, but<br />\nthere's no reason to go to the movies, or at least<br />\nthis movie, to see it.

Writer Monte Merrick<br />\njumps from one story to another with little care.<br />\nIt may have looked good when it was being<br />\nfilmed, but one gets a sense that the film was<br />\nrewritten several times, then hacked to pieces by<br />\nits editors.<br />\nThe three McDermott children, growing up (at<br />\nleast physically) in a small South Carolina town,<br />\nare distinguished only by their degenerate individuality.

There must be no drinking age in<br />\nSouth Carolina, because Duncan hangs out in the<br />\nsame bar as his parents and every other person<br />\nin the town over the age of twelve.

With a brief, cheerful<br />\nfrom<br />\n\"Hello<br />\nthere!\"<br />\nvocalist/guitarist Glenn Tilbrook,<br />\nthe band leapt headfirst into an arrangement of 1987's AOR hit,<br />\n\"The Prisoner.\" This was<br />\nfollowed by a mixture of older<br />\nhits with songs from the group's<br />\nnew album, \"frank.\"<br />\nStandouts included an energetic<br />\nperformance of \"Rose I Said,\"<br />\na new tune that seems a natural<br />\nfor college radio airplay, and<br />\n\"Cool For Cats,\" a somewhat<br />\ngoofy but likable song from one<br />\nof the group's early albums. Also<br />\nnotable was a new version of<br />\n<br />\n\"Hourglass,\" rather different<br />\nfrom, and even catchier than, the<br />\nalbum arrangement.<br />\nThe group sounded very<br />\n\"together,\" something not to be<br />\ntaken for granted, even in a group<br />\nwhose first album was released<br />\nover ten years ago. Squeeze, after<br />\nall, did split up and re-form in the<br />\nmid- 1980s.<br />\nVocalist/guitarist Chris Difford's deep and very English<br />\nvoice still harmonizes as well as<br />\never with Tilbrook's unmistakable, sweet tenor. Pianist<br />\nJulian (\"Jools\") Holland, an exceptional musician who turned up<br />\non Fine Young Cannibals' megahit \"Good Thing\" this summer,<br />\ncontributed solo licks to nearly<br />\nevery song. He delighted the audience of about 2,500 with his<br />\ndistinctive, campy, personal style<br />\nand comments. (Holland is a<br />\nformer BBC talk-show host.)<br />\nSolid support was provided by<br />\ndrummer Gilson Lavis and bass<br />\nplayer Deith Wilkinson.<br />\n<br />\nIn the final song of the regular<br />\nset, the current Top 40 hit \"If It's<br />\nLove,\" Tilbrook explained to the<br />\ndelighted audience, \"On the<br />\nrecord, there's a lovely chorus<br />\nthat comes in here,\" and sang out<br />\nseparate parts for men and<br />\nwomen to echo. \"Dreamy,\" he<br />\ncommented with a grin, as the<br />\nfans giggled their way through<br />\nthe backing vocal.<br />\nThe final encore capped the concert with a bluesy jam session that<br />\nshifted smoothly into a rendition<br />\nof Squeeze's first major hit,<br />\n\"Tempted.\"<br />\nOverall, the final feeling was of<br />\nthe rock equivalent of understated<br />\nelegance. Squeeze didn't try to<br />\ngive us showy staging or lots of<br />\nmugging for the sake of the audience; rather, they concentrated<br />\non the music. To the fans at<br />\nLoyola's Reitz Arena last<br />\nweekend, the result was a concert<br />\nto he remembered.<br />\n<br />\nvisually vigorous, sequences that<br />\nseem to hold symbolic<br />\nsignificance. These scenes,<br />\nhowever, completely interrupt<br />\nwhat little flow the film had<br />\nalready established. Case in<br />\npoint: the scene in which a man<br />\n,holding a rusted muffler over his<br />\nhead stands in the street (backed<br />\nby cherubic music) and concentrates his attention on the can collector who tumbles and rages on<br />\na couch on the sidewalk. The entire sequence is completely<br />\nsuperfluous.<br />\nAt the end of the picture, the<br />\ncan collector encounters the<br />\nAbstract Zygote Dancers who,<br />\nafter attacking him, dance an odd<br />\nballet, then retreat into cans<br />\nmarked \"Caution: Genetic<br />\nWaste.\" Afterwards, the<br />\nTrashmonster's aide hands the<br />\ncan collector a book on research<br />\ngenetics. After reading it, the can<br />\ncollector\u2014along with his new<br />\nfriends the Trashmonster and his<br />\naide\u2014jumps triumphantly up and<br />\ndown, swept away in unbridled<br />\nand unexplained joy.<br />\n<br />\nglance,<br />\nAt<br />\nfirst<br />\n\"Trashmonster\" seems to<br />\noverflow with deep inner meaning that begs to be tied into<br />\ncoherent bundles. Unfortunately,<br />\nrather than twine or even cord,<br />\nTurner chooses spaghetti<br />\nnoodles.<br />\nAt best, the film is fractured<br />\nand disjointed, combining commentary on urban poverty, the<br />\ndangers of waste products, and<br />\neven recycling. These ideas float<br />\nas if suspended in a pile of<br />\nabstract trash. None of them seem<br />\nattached to any sort of resolution.<br />\nThe main problem with<br />\n\"Trashmonster\" is that it tries to<br />\nexist on a sensory level alone,<br />\nforsaking the emotional heart of<br />\nfilmmaking that mingles with the<br />\nmedium's aesthetic aspects. The<br />\nvisual aspects of \"Trashmonster\"<br />\nare successful to an extent.<br />\nDespite the noticeably unsophisticated film equipment,<br />\nTurner manages some interesting<br />\ncamera angles and shots that are<br />\nbold and daring. Dick Turner's<br />\ninteresting soundtrack punctuates<br />\n<br />\nthe cinematography cleverly. But<br />\nthe novelty of it wears too thin,<br />\ntoo quickly.<br />\nThe acting in this movie is<br />\nsecondary. Since there is no<br />\ndialogue, emotion must be<br />\ntransmitted through mannerism<br />\nand physical expression. Dick<br />\nTurner, as the can collector, performs adequately and no more.<br />\nHis character is merely another<br />\ntool to gain visual effect, as are<br />\nall the characters in the picture.<br />\nThe film decides early on<br />\nagainst developing any sort of<br />\nplot or ideas. Instead, Turner<br />\nsimply throws them out and<br />\nleaves the audience wondering<br />\nabout them, as if they were indistinguishable candy wrappers<br />\nsitting on a lawn. It seems that the<br />\nTurners learned the process of<br />\nfilmmaking with this film: it is<br />\nlargely experimental. Perhaps<br />\nbetter work can be expected from<br />\nthem as they mature as movie<br />\nnow,<br />\nFor<br />\nmakers.<br />\n\"Trashmonster\" barely rises<br />\nabove its own heap of rubbish.<br />\n<br />\nKatrina, Waves Annoy, but Squeeze<br />\nDelivers with Understated Elegance<br />\nthat his concerts are dull or anticlimatic; the music is so good<br />\nand the playing so skillfully executed that the atmosphere is intense rather than detached. That's<br />\nthe overall impression Squeeze<br />\ngave during their concert at<br />\nLoyola College's Reitz Arena on<br />\nSunday.<br />\nIf anything, Squeeze's professionalism was underscored by the<br />\nunbelievably pretentious theatrics<br />\nof the opening act, Katrina and<br />\nthe Waves. These infamous onehit wonders, after several<br />\n<br />\nby Christopher Bonanos<br />\nDid you ever notice that the very<br />\nbest rock musicians don't go in<br />\nfor any of the posturing that<br />\nmediocre acts love so much?<br />\nWatch Eric Clapton when he<br />\ntakes a solo. He doesn't run<br />\naround; he doesn't make enraptured faces at his rhythm guitarist;<br />\nhe doesn't throw his hair back<br />\nand forth. The guy just sort of<br />\nstands there and concentrates on<br />\nhis playing\u2014and these incredible<br />\nlicks come out. This isn't to say<br />\n<br />\neminently forgettable songs punctuated with dull solos, concluded their only (with good reason!)<br />\nwell-known tune, \"Walking on<br />\nSunshine.\" Lead singer Katrina<br />\n(does anyone know her last name,<br />\nanyway? Or care?) sounds and<br />\nlooks less and less like the girlish<br />\nlight-pop vocalist she once was.<br />\nIn fact, she is beginning to look<br />\nand sound a whole lot like Robert<br />\nPlant at this point. Mercifully, the<br />\ngroup was off stage in well under<br />\nan hour.<br />\nAfter the requisite few minutes<br />\n<br />\nMOVIES<br />\n<br />\n`Trashmonster' Doesn't Even<br />\nLive Up to its Name<br />\npair of local boys who have spent<br />\ntheir last five years creating this<br />\nmovie, which was filmed entirely in Baltimore. In fact, as the<br />\nopening scene unfolded, \"I know<br />\nwhere that is\" and \"I've been<br />\nthere\" traveled audibly from<br />\nleaning mouths to ears throughout<br />\nthe audience.<br />\nThe storyline of \"Trashmonster,\" if you can call<br />\nit that, is this: genetic waste turned living organism goes out and<br />\nkills some people. It's not quite<br />\nclear how or why it does this; it<br />\njust does. A can collector<br />\nsomehow finds out about this<br />\nmonster later in the film. But<br />\nfrom this point, unfortunately, the<br />\nalready foggy plot turns positively milky.<br />\nThere is a scene toward the<br />\nmiddle of the film in which the<br />\n<br />\nby Joseph Joon<br />\n\"Trashmonster,\" which<br />\nplayed Oct. 20-22 at the<br />\nMaryland Institute of Art, can be<br />\nforgiven for most of its shortcomings simply because of its low<br />\nbudget and director Henry<br />\nTurner's amateur status. After<br />\nall, the film was billed as part of<br />\nthe Institute's \"Cult and LowBudget\" film series. With this in<br />\nmind, most moviegoers tend to be<br />\nat least somewhat forgiving. One<br />\ncan turn away from occasional<br />\nbad editing, or look at his shoes<br />\nwhen he sees poor and unconvincing costumes. But there are<br />\nflaws\u2014many of them in<br />\n\"Trashmonster\"\u2014that all<br />\nmoviegoers must stand and refuse<br />\nto allow.<br />\nHenry and Dick Turner are a<br />\n<br />\ncan collector and a man in a white<br />\njacket holding a roll of floor plans<br />\nwalk through the abandoned<br />\nbuilding where the trashmonster<br />\nresides. This scene epitomizes the<br />\nfault which runs through the heart<br />\nof the plot. It is unclear whether<br />\nthe two are searching out the<br />\ntrashmonster or looking at the<br />\nbuilding for some other purpose.<br />\nIt's a confusing moment: for all<br />\nwe know, these men want to open<br />\na brothel or perhaps a tanning<br />\nsalon.

They'll be back on<br />\nNovember 15 and 16. The blood<br />\nused in area hospitals comes only from volunteers, not from<br />\ncommercial blood centers. (Their<br />\ncrop gets purified and processed<br />\ninto other medical products.)<br />\nBlood donation takes about one<br />\nhour. When you check in you will<br />\nreceive a pamphlet explaining<br />\nAIDS and blood donation. If you<br />\n'don't know by now, you cannot<br />\nget AIDS by donating blood since<br />\neach needle is used only once. If<br />\nyou have AIDS, by donating<br />\nthere is a small chance you can<br />\ngive it to someone else. Although<br />\nthe blood is tested for HIV antibodies, the test is about 95 percent reliable. The pamphlet lists<br />\ngroups known to be at risk for<br />\nHIV infection and ask those in<br />\nthose groups not to give blood.<br />\nLater, donors who think they may<br />\nbe in a risk group but don't want<br />\nanyone to know, can mark their<br />\nblood with a \"Do Not<br />\nTransfuse\" barcode and give<br />\nblood as if nothing was wrong.<br />\nAt the Red Cross headquarters,<br />\nthe barcodes are read and the<br />\n\"Do Not Transfuse\" pints are<br />\nthrown away.<br />\nAfter getting a checkup and a<br />\nmedical history, you are handed<br />\na blood bag attached to three<br />\nvials for hepatitis, syphillis, and<br />\nAIDS tests. The bag and vials<br />\ncontain a yellow liquid to prevent<br />\nclotting.<br />\nAfter thoroughly scrubbing<br />\ndown your arm to protect you<br />\nfrom infection, the nurse nudges<br />\na small needle into your arm. In<br />\nfive to ten minutes, the bag and<br />\nvials are filled. When the nurse<br />\ntells you to relax, do it. Nervousness can constrict blood<br />\n<br />\nvessels, slowing blood flow and<br />\nstretching donation time to as long<br />\nas 15 minutes.<br />\nYour body normally has 10 to<br />\n12 pints of blood. By removing<br />\na pint, the Red Cross has lowered<br />\nyou blood pressure. Since<br />\npressure is what makes the blood<br />\ngo 'round, some dizziness as your<br />\nbrain gets a bit less oxygen than<br />\nit should is normal. There's more<br />\nfluid outside of the circulatory<br />\nsystem, and by lying still for a<br />\nfew minutes, you give it a chance<br />\nto flow into the system and pump<br />\nup your pressure. The Red Cross<br />\nrecommends extra fluids before<br />\nand after donation to help the process along.<br />\nWhile you drink your water<br />\nand juice and eat your cookies<br />\n(sugar to replace the blood sugar<br />\nyou donated), your pint is put in<br />\na cooler where it waits for a Red<br />\nCross volunteer to take it back to<br />\nthe lab.<br />\nAt the lab, the bag goes one<br />\nway and the vials go another.<br />\nThey are labled with a donor<br />\nnumber, and the blood products<br />\nfrom the bag do not go out until<br />\nthe tests on the vials are complete. Donors also keep a copy of<br />\ntheir number, and if they decide<br />\nlater that their blood might be unsafe, they can call and<br />\nanonymously tell the Red Cross<br />\nnot to transfuse the blood.<br />\nDonated blood is almost always<br />\nseparated into components, which<br />\nis both economical and useful to<br />\npatients who need only part of the<br />\nblood. Red cells are transfused<br />\nduring surgery and into anemic<br />\npatients. Plasma is also used during surgery, as well as in burn patients who dehydrate rapidly since<br />\nthey lack the waterproofing of the<br />\nskin. Platelets are given to patients whose own platelets are<br />\ndefective. Other special products,<br />\nlike factor VIII for hemophiliacs,<br />\nare made when hospitals request<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\nThe Squid<br />\nHow do photocopiers work?<br />\n<br />\nThe heart of a photocopier is a metal cylinder that is given<br />\na negative charge when the start button is pushed. The cylinder<br />\nturns as the light moves across the original. A reflection of the<br />\nlight hits the rotating cylinder. Black paper doesn't reflect light,<br />\nand white paper does. Thus only the parts of the cylinder which<br />\ncorrespond to the white parts of the paper are illuminated. The<br />\nlight neutralizes the parts of the cylinder it hits, leaving the parts<br />\nof the cylinder corresponding to black on the original with<br />\nnegative charge. Positively charged toner powder is brushed<br />\nacross the cylinder, where it sticks to the negative charge. The<br />\ncylinder rolls over a fresh sheet of paper, which is heated to<br />\nmake the toner powder adhere to the copy.<br />\n<br />\nIt was an endless palette of exotic colors so intoxicatingly<br />\nbeautiful, I was left breathless.<br />\nSunlight spilled through shaggy<br />\nclouds lending an ethereal sparkle<br />\nto the Amazon rainforest. As the<br />\nsmall riverboat floated down the<br />\nvein of the Amazon River, I<br />\ncould hear hissing echoes of the<br />\nfires destroying this beauty.<br />\nForest destruction alters the<br />\nlocal climate by reducing the<br />\nwater circulating between the<br />\ntrees and the clouds, and adds to<br />\nthe atmospheric burden of carbon<br />\ndioxide. Furthermore, the lives of<br />\nmore than one million species of<br />\nthe earth's biological and genetic<br />\nheritage will soon be lost because<br />\nof this environmental exploitation. Even worse, the hope of<br />\nameliorating these horrific conditions depends on one of the most<br />\ncorrupt goverments in Latin<br />\nAmerica\u2014Brazil.<br />\nBrazil's militant president Jose<br />\nSarney has suffered lately for<br />\nallowing the rainforest to be<br />\ndestroyed. But Brazil is in an<br />\neconomic crisis: a $1 II billion<br />\nforeign debt and a staggering<br />\n17,903 percent domestic inflation<br />\nrate. Dr. Declan DePoar, expert<br />\ngeologist and professor of the<br />\nGlobal Warming Theory class,<br />\ncomments, \"We have to deal<br />\nwith the fact that the Third World<br />\nhas aspirations to acheive our<br />\nlevel of standard of living. And<br />\nif we don't tackle that problem<br />\nthen we can't solve the problem<br />\nof the Earth as a whole.\"<br />\nThe deforestation of the<br />\nAmazon basin is of particular importance because of the role it<br />\nplays in the greenhouse effect\u2014<br />\nthe trapping of the heat by atmospheric carbon dioxide. The<br />\nAmazon stores more than 75<br />\nbillion tons of carbon dioxide in<br />\nits trees. When the trees are burned, carbon dioxide is then spewed in the air, thus ultimately<br />\nmagnifying the greenhouse effect<br />\nat an incredible rate.<br />\nIn recent years, climatologists<br />\nhave detected evidence of instability in the current global<br />\nclimate. One such indicator is the<br />\nincrease in the volume of carbon<br />\ndioxide, a very influential component of the Earth's ability to retain heat, in the atmosphere. The<br />\nEarth has already warmed by<br />\nmore than half a degree celsius<br />\nsince the mid-1800s. A further increase of 1.5\u00b0C-4.5\u00b0C is<br />\npredicted within five decades.<br />\nThis may not seem like much, but<br />\nit will be the highest the Earth<br />\nwill have reached in the last one<br />\nhundred thousand years. Small<br />\ndifferences<br />\nin<br />\naverage<br />\ntemperature make huge differences in the climate. The last<br />\nice age, which reached its peak<br />\n18,000 years ago, was only 3<br />\ndegrees colder than today.<br />\nThe greenhouse effect was first<br />\ndescribed in 1827 by French<br />\nmathematician Jean Baptiste<br />\nFourier. He pointed out that the<br />\nEarth's atmosphere acts like a<br />\ntransparent cover of a box. Gases<br />\nin the atmosphere allow sunlight<br />\nthrough to heat the surface of the<br />\nearth, called greenhouse gases,<br />\nbut traps some of the warmth that<br />\nradiates back. An increase in the<br />\nconcentration of these gases<br />\ntranslates into an increase in the<br />\nheat retained by the planet. This<br />\nextra heat will eventually melt the<br />\nEarth's reflecting surfaces, the<br />\npolar caps. By reflecting solar<br />\nheat, they keep the earth cool.<br />\nDarker, blue water and more<br />\ngreen vegetation, the result of the<br />\nmelted ice, will absorb even more<br />\nheat thus again increasing the<br />\ntemperature.<br />\nWhat are some of these<br />\ngreenhouse gases, and where do<br />\nthey come from? One greenhouse<br />\ngas that is of great concern is the<br />\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).<br />\nThis gas is the result of modern<br />\ntechnology\u2014such human inventions as aerosols, refrigerators,<br />\nair conditioners, solvents for the<br />\ncomputer industry, sterilants for<br />\nmedical supplies. Although their<br />\natmospheric concentration is<br />\nminute, they block much more<br />\nthan carbon dioxide. In the opinion of one expert, halting the use<br />\nof CFCs would be \"the one<br />\nsingle step we could take im-<br />\n<br />\nmediately that would make a<br />\nstrong positive contribution to<br />\nreducing the greenhouse effect.\"<br />\noccurring<br />\nNaturally<br />\ngreenhouse gases that are major<br />\ncontributors to the warming effect<br />\nare methane, nitrous oxide, and<br />\nozone. Methane is produced by<br />\nbacteria which live in an oxygenfree environmemt such as the bottom of marshes, rice patties, and<br />\nin the gut of animals like cows,<br />\nsheep, and camels. A typical<br />\ndomestic cow produces about 200<br />\nliters of methane a day. Leakages<br />\nfrom gas pipes, coal mines, and<br />\nother underground sources are<br />\nhuman contributions to the<br />\namount of methane in the air.<br />\nForty-five percent of the nitrous<br />\nacid, once used as a dental<br />\nanaesthetic (more commonly<br />\nknown as laughing gas), present<br />\nin the air comes from the combustion of fossil fuels, and the<br />\ncultivation of the soil and the use<br />\nof nitrogenous fertilizers. Ozone,<br />\nfound in the lower atmosphere,<br />\nis created by sunlight acting on<br />\nfossil fuel pollutants from cars<br />\nand other sources.<br />\nThe major contributing<br />\ngreenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.<br />\nCarbon, the basis of most life on<br />\nthe planet, is found in rocks, soil,<br />\nwater, plant and animal life, and<br />\nthe atmosphere. Plants use<br />\nphotosynthesis to get the carbon<br />\nthey need to build their cells from<br />\nthe atmosphere. Animals get carbon by eating plants or other<br />\nanimals. Carbon is returned to the<br />\natmosphere when animals breathe<br />\nand when plants are burned or<br />\ndecay.<br />\nThe world is facing a population explosion that will have an<br />\nimportant effect on the increase<br />\nof the greenhouse gases. Professor DePaor explains, \"Most<br />\npeople perhaps don't realize that<br />\nin 3 or 4 years time, the Earth's<br />\npopulation will have increased by<br />\nan amount equal to the population<br />\nof the U.S.A. And there won't be<br />\na new frontier, a new world in<br />\n<br />\nwhich to put all these new people.\" Demand on land, on natural<br />\nresources, and an increase in the<br />\nproduction and use of modern<br />\ntechnological products will alter<br />\nthe Earth's geographical and<br />\nclimatic systems.<br />\nIt is the responsibility of the inhabitants of this planet to cultivate<br />\nthe abundant but limited<br />\nresources and beauty that we are<br />\nprivileged to have to enjoy. My<br />\nbrief excursion to the Amazon<br />\nRainforest has made me more<br />\ncognizant of the destruction and<br />\nmutilation we have inflicted on<br />\nour planet. The Amazon, left<br />\nalone, is a self-sustaining<br />\necosystem that can thrive indefinitely. Deforestation of the<br />\nAmazon will eventually lead to<br />\nthe self-destruction of the rainforest; heat, drying,and wind will<br />\ncause the trees to die on their<br />\nown.<br />\nThe rainforest travesty has<br />\nalready produced a martyr, Chico<br />\nMendes. Mendes, leader of the<br />\nrubber tappers, was murdered for<br />\ntrying to stand in the ways of ranchers. He died to stop<br />\ndeforestation and to preserve the<br />\nway of life he and many others<br />\nlived. Rubber tappers are living<br />\nproof that the poor can maintain<br />\na reasonable standard of living<br />\nwithout the destruction of the<br />\nrainforest.<br />\nThe battle to stop deforestation in Amazonia is also being<br />\nfought here, at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe weapons used are not guns<br />\nbut education, understanding, and<br />\nthe power of the voice of the<br />\nstudents that can influence the<br />\npoliticians on Capitol Hill to take<br />\nmore aggressive w !\u2022 ns to deal<br />\nwith the environmental problems<br />\nthe U.S. and other countries have<br />\ncreated. The Students for Environmental Action are highly active in voicing their views and informing other concerned Hopkins<br />\nstudents and professors about environmental problems through<br />\nguest speakers. Just recently, Lisa<br />\n<br />\nNowakowski, the Maryland<br />\nspokesperson for the Rainforest<br />\nAction Network, gave a powerful and informative presentation<br />\nabout rainforest destruction. She<br />\nurged people to care for their environment and to take action to<br />\nmake this world a better place to<br />\nlive.<br />\nThe Students for Environmental Action is just a small representative of the many concerned<br />\nstudents here at Hopkins.<br />\nEvidence of this concern is<br />\nwitnessed by the overwhelming<br />\nnumber of students that have<br />\nregistered for \"Global Warming<br />\nTheory,\" \"Planet Earth,\" and<br />\nto<br />\n\"Introduction<br />\nOceanography.\" This fall 146<br />\nenrolled in \"Global Warming\"<br />\nand even more importantly,<br />\nremarks Dr. DePaor,\"is the enthusiasm students have shown for<br />\nthe subject. We certainly seem to<br />\nhave come out of the Reagan Era<br />\nof self-interest. I see analogies<br />\nbetween the current student<br />\npopulation and the population of<br />\nthe sixties. But this current<br />\npopulation is much more<br />\nsophisticated. The sixties, the<br />\nflower-power community were<br />\nrelatively naive.

This generation has the sixties kind of spirit<br />\nplus an eighties attitude towards<br />\nunderstanding of the earth.\"<br />\nCertainly, next fall the Global<br />\nWarming Theory class will be offered.

Eight<br />\nseniors had departed, leaving<br />\nnumerous positions vacant, and<br />\nthe squad was omitted from the<br />\nSouth's preseason top ten.<br />\n\"Almost everyone on the team<br />\nwas somebody who had never<br />\nstarted before, or had to move to<br />\na new position,\" said senior tricaptain John Dengler. But coach<br />\nJohn Haus, assistant coach Mark<br />\nButler, and the Jays ignored<br />\npredictions and trained to win.<br />\nThe season started poorly,<br />\nthough, as local Division I rival<br />\nTowson State downed Hopkins<br />\nthe<br />\non<br />\nturf at Homewood, 3-1.<br />\n\"It was disappointing that we<br />\ndidn't play well,\" said freshman<br />\nsweeper Mike VandeKieft,<br />\n'because it would have given us<br />\n<br />\nthe opportunity to make some<br />\nnoise at the beginning of the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nA 2-0 triumph at St. Mary's<br />\nevened Hopkins' mark. The team<br />\nthen hosted Washington & Lee<br />\nand Carnegie-Mellon in the Blue<br />\nJay Classic. Hopkins edged W&L<br />\n2-1 in the opener of the roundrobin tournament, avenging a bitter 3-2 defeat to the Generals' last<br />\nyear in Lexington. Against<br />\nCarnegie-Mellon, junior tricaptain Warren Jones' goal sunk<br />\nthe Tartans, 1-0.<br />\n\"We played two highly-ranked<br />\nteams ...<br />\nand we ended up starting a sevengame winning streak,\" said<br />\nDengler. \"That was definitely the.<br />\nmost important weekend of the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nThe streak included a 2-0<br />\ntriumph, fueled by goals from<br />\nScott Wilson and Greg Bronshvag, over Southeast section<br />\nrival and defending MAC champion Haverford College, in driving winds and rain. \"Usually,<br />\nthey're our biggest divisional<br />\nrivals,\" said senior tri-captain<br />\nDan Sisbarro. \"A win against<br />\nthem anytime is huge.\"<br />\nThe Jays also edged Salisbury<br />\n<br />\n(2-1), York, Ursinus, and<br />\nDickinson (all 1-0). Western<br />\nMaryland snapped the streak with<br />\na 2-2 tie at Homewood, and a 0-0<br />\ndraw against section opponent<br />\nSwarthmore further frustrated the<br />\nBlue Jays.<br />\nWith an 8-1-2 mark midway<br />\nthrough<br />\nthe<br />\nseason, the Jays headed to<br />\nFredericksbutrg, VA to confront<br />\nnationally ranked<br />\nMary<br />\nWashingtoh College. On a wet,<br />\nbleak afternoon, Hopkins fell 1-0,<br />\nbut took some solace in that, as<br />\nVandeKieft said, \"we showed we<br />\ncould play well against a top<br />\nteam.\"<br />\nComing off of the difficult<br />\ndefeat,<br />\nthe Jays exploded for five goals<br />\nagainst Franklin & Marshall to<br />\nhalt their slide, with Jones,<br />\nWilson, Sisbarro, and juniors<br />\nRich Bronshvag and Todd MarOral! tallying.<br />\nBronshvag netted both goals in<br />\na 2-0 win over Widener, and<br />\nJones' score defeated the<br />\nWashington College Shoremen<br />\n1-0<br />\nto<br />\nwind<br />\nup<br />\nregular season play<br />\nHopkins and Swarthmore completed their MAC Southeast slates<br />\n<br />\nwith 4-0-1 records, setting up a<br />\ntiebreaker at Homewood. In \"one<br />\nof the most exciting games on the<br />\nturf in the past few years,\" according to Dengler, Hopkins<br />\noutgunned Swarthmore 4-2 in a<br />\nshootout victory.<br />\nThe win moved the Jays into<br />\nthe MAC South final, where they<br />\nwere downed by national<br />\npowerhouse Muhlenberg College, 2-0. \"I don't know what<br />\ntype of lineup they had,\" said<br />\n.VandeKieft, \"but they had so<br />\nmany players attacking. . . they<br />\ncounterattacked well also.\"<br />\nHopkins finished the season<br />\nwith a record of 12-3-2. A high<br />\nwork rate and strong contributions from many players powered<br />\nthe Jays. \"Because of our work<br />\nethic, we were never out of any<br />\ngame this year,\" said Jones.<br />\nA solid goalkeeping duo will<br />\nreturn next autumn for Hopkins.<br />\nSophomore stalwart Jerry Irvine<br />\nconceded only 11 goals in 17<br />\ngames, good for a .61 goals<br />\nagainst average. He posted ten<br />\nshutouts. \"Jerry did a great job<br />\nthis year,\" said Jones.

The program<br />\nwas sponsored by the Amnesty<br />\nchapters of the Baltimore area<br />\nand the Chaplain's Office of<br />\nHopkins and featured two<br />\nspeakers: Bill Frelick, an analyst<br />\nfor the U.S. Committee for<br />\nRefugees, and Kassie S. Neou, a<br />\nsurvivor of Cambodia's \"Killing<br />\nFields.\"<br />\nFrelick spoke of his volunteer<br />\nwork through Amnesty on behalf<br />\nof refugees worldwide, and Neou<br />\ndescribed his experiences as a<br />\nrefugee from the Khmer Rouge<br />\nregime.<br />\nFrelick first became involved<br />\nwith refugee work as a member<br />\nof his college Amnesty International group. Eventually, he came<br />\ninto contact with more and more<br />\nrefugees as an Amnesty volunteer<br />\nand decided to specialize in<br />\nrefugee work. Frelick stressed<br />\nthat \"human rights are my main<br />\nconcern, as opposed to the social<br />\nwork approach to refugees.\"<br />\nFrelick distingushed a refugee<br />\nfrom an \"economic migrant\":<br />\n\"Refugees are from different<br />\nracial, economic, religious, and<br />\nideological backgrounds, but they<br />\nall share a common fear of<br />\npersecution and gross human<br />\nrights abuse upon return to their<br />\nrespective homelands. That is<br />\nwhy they fled in the first place,<br />\nnot for a better economic life, but<br />\nin many cases, to protect their<br />\nlives.<br />\nIn 1980, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was<br />\namended to clarify the definition<br />\nof a refugee as \"a person with<br />\nwell-founded fear of persecution<br />\nupon return to his or her former<br />\ncountry on the basis of race,<br />\nreligion, nationality, political opi-<br /><br />\nnion, or membership in a social<br />\norganization.<br />\nInternational law prohibits<br />\ndeporting anyone to a country<br />\nwhere he or she risks being<br />\npersecuted. However, many<br />\nstates simply do not allow<br />\nrefugees to emigrate to their<br />\ncountries.<br />\nThe countries of destination<br />\noften only issue visas to those<br />\nwho are likely to return or simply deny \"refugee\" status in favor<br />\nof \"economic<br />\nmigrant\"<br />\nclassification.<br />\nThe countries of the refugees'<br />\norigin regularly put up barriers to<br />\nleaving the country in the first<br />\nplace. Often, the airline ticket<br />\nteller, who must determine<br />\nwhether the<br />\nprospective<br />\nemigrants have proper travel<br />\npapers, denies refugees the permission to leave.<br />\nThe U.S. frequently interdicts<br />\nrefugees at its borders. In the case.<br />\nof the Haitian boat people in<br />\n1981, only six out of 20,000 were<br />\neven brought ashore for asylum<br />\nhearings.<br />\nAccording to Frelick, it is a<br />\nbasic human right to emigrate but<br />\nnot to immigrate; there is no basic<br />\nright of asylum.<br />\nEvery refugee faces the future<br />\nas a \"man without a country\"<br />\nwhether he or she is granted<br />\nasylum or not. \"Even if a refugee<br />\nis resettled or immigrates locally,\" said Frelick, \"he or she remains a refugee for the rest of his<br />\nor her life. A refugee is forever<br />\nspiritually dislokated.\" Refugees<br />\nshould never be repatriated<br />\ninvoluntarily.<br />\nFrelick emphasized that \"the<br />\nU.S. [Department of Immigration] tends to be xenophobic<br />\ntoward Third World and Middle<br />\nEast refugees. Sometimes [as in<br />\nthe case of an Iranian refugee] it<br />\ntakes slashing one's wrists to prove the fear for one's life is real.\"<br />\nAccording to Frelick, Amnes-<br /><br />\nty refugee workers seek to insure<br />\na fair asylum hearing for each<br />\nrefugee to determine whether the<br />\nrefugee faces the danger of violations of his or her human rights<br />\nif the refugee returns to the home<br />\ncountry.<br />\nNeou's recounting of his experiences as a refugee from Cambodia's \"killing fields\" in 1979<br />\nadded a distinctly personal<br />\nperspective to the program.

His Rutgers data<br />\nshowed that the average freshman<br />\nwill count a third of his dormmates as friends within two<br />\nmonths. Half of the five best<br />\nfriends of freshmen and<br />\nsophomores were friends made in<br />\ncollege; three out of those five<br />\nbest friends were from college for<br />\njuniors and seniors.<br />\nOf equal importance, Moffatt<br />\nnoted, were sexual relations,<br />\nwhich he claimed are intertwined with college friendships. He<br />\nnoted that there is more real and<br />\npremarital sex in modern college<br />\nlife, existing on \"hundreds of<br />\nlevels of analysis.\" While he<br />\nfound \"different ways of approaching sex,\" the majority of<br />\nthe reports Moffatt received from<br />\nRutgers undergraduates indicated<br />\nthat long-term relationships and<br />\nconventional sexual practices are<br />\nthe norm. He also concluded that<br />\n\"romance is not dead.\"<br />\nStudents, Moffatt found, tended to have self-imposed<br />\nrestraints. Discreet sex practices<br />\nand language, unisex dress, and<br />\nan \"incest taboo\" on dorm relationships, existed at Rutgers.<br />\nUnfortunately, Moffatt noted,<br />\nundergraduates seem to focus<br />\nmore on the pleasure and<br /><br />\npsychology of relations, rather<br />\nthan AIDS and assault. Only<br />\ntwenty percent of students, he<br />\nclaimed, use condoms.<br />\nModern college culture is a<br />\n\"mass culture,\" according to<br />\nMoffatt. Traditional, earlytwentieth century college culture<br />\nwas invented by students; unique<br />\nlingo, dress, leisure, and sports,<br />\ndistinguished college attendance,<br />\nMoffatt said. Modern college life,<br />\nhe claims, lacks \"references to<br />\nliterary<br />\nculture\"<br />\nand<br />\n\"vulgarizes\"<br />\nacademic<br />\ndiscussions.<br />\nProfessor Moffatt did not draw<br />\nany value judgments within his<br />\nlecture and openly admitted the<br />\n\"lack<br />\nof<br />\ntheoretical<br />\nconclusions.\"<br />\nA student discussion panel,<br />\ncomposed of Murat Akalin; Joyce<br />\nBoyer; Sharon Reynolds, assistant director of Residential Life;<br />\nand Brandon Rosser presented<br />\nprepared reactions to both Professor Moffatt's lecture and book.<br />\nThe panel generally agreed with<br />\nhis conclusions, but some questioned whether his research was<br />\ngenerally applicable, particularly to Hopkins.<br />\nAkalin thought that Moffatt,<br />\ngave an \"accurate picture of college life.\" He added that he had<br />\nhoped for more emphasis on<br />\nalcohol as a central element in<br />\ncollege life.<br />\n\"It was inciteful and<br />\nhumorous,\" opened Boyer. But<br />\nshe challenged Moffatt's<br /><br />\nmethodology and did not think<br />\nthat his results reflected life at<br />\nsmall, elite schools such as<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nReynolds found \"a lot of<br />\ngeneralizations\" in his lecture<br />\nand took exception to Moffatt's<br />\nclaim that students resent<br />\n\"student-life specialists.\"<br />\nRosser said he found himself<br />\n\"constantly trying to defend<br />\nhimself\" against Moffatt's<br />\ndescription of athletes and fraternity members as \"Neanderthals.\"He was dismayed by the<br />\nlack of emphasis on \"positive<br />\naspects\" of these activity groups.<br />\nMoffatt answered the panel's<br />\ncriticisms. He did not claim that<br />\nhis findings at Rutgers were entirely typical of American modern<br />\ncollege life nationwide, but he<br />\nbelieved that his research does<br />\nreveal certain dynamics. He<br />\nstressed the fact that his<br />\nmethodology was based on student rekponses. \"It is hard to<br />\nremember the serious reason for<br />\nbeing in college,\" he said.<br />\nIn response to Rosser's<br />\ncriticism, Moffatt suggested a<br />\nplayful use of the term Neanderthal in relation to fraternity<br />\nmembers, while maintaining that<br />\nstudents at Rutgers had reported<br />\nbehavior in keeping with this<br />\ndescription.

The fact is most<br />\nstudents do have enough time but<br />\ndo not know how to use it. \"How<br />\nTo Do It All\" was the topic<br />\ndiscussed by Chaplain Gretchen<br />\nVan Utt in Tuesday's Brown Bag<br />\nLunch lecture.<br />\nThe Chaplain designated four<br />\ncategories in which people spend<br />\ntheir time. In an average week,<br />\none spends approximately 11<br />\nhours on meals, 49 hours on<br />\nsleep, 20 hours on studying, and<br />\n19 hours in classes and labs.<br />\nAmazingly, that leaves 69 hours<br />\nthat are unaccounted for. If one<br />\ndesignated 20 hours for work or<br />\nextracurricular activities, that still<br />\nleaves over 40 hours per week of<br />\nfree, or flexible time.<br />\nFor those who still feel constrained by the lack of time, Van<br />\nUtt illustrated two ways of gaining time: 1) Learn to use small<br />\nblocks of time, like the period<br />\nbetween classes; or 2) Work<br />\nmore efficiently in the available<br />\ntime limit.<br />\nVan Utt described scheduling<br />\nas the key to time management.<br />\n\"If you write down what you<br />\nplan to do, then you are more<br />\nlikely to accomplish it.\" The first<br />\nstep in scheduling is long-range<br />\nplanning.<br />\nA monthly activity calendar<br />\nshould outline assignments along<br />\nwith major personal goals, such<br />\nas learning a new art, participating in a new sport, or losing weight. Including these objectives in long-term planning is important because otherwise one<br />\nloses sight of the original<br />\nincentive.<br />\nThe next step is to arrange a<br />\nweekly activity schedule. This<br />\nschedule should primarily contain<br />\nfixed activities such as classes and<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe third schedule is a list of<br />\npriorities for each day. Schedul-<br /><br />\ning eliminates the need to hold<br />\neverything in one's mind and<br />\nhelps one feel more secure. The<br />\nmore in control one feels, the<br />\nlower one's stress level.<br />\nVan Utt went on to give advice<br />\nabout how to make the most out<br />\nof study time. She advised against<br />\ntrying to study four or five hours<br />\nat a time. Studying at a stretch induces loss of concentration.<br />\nWhen one does have a lot of<br />\nstudy time, Van Utt suggested<br />\ntaking 5 to 10 minute breaks<br />\nevery 40 to 50 minutes. \"It's<br />\ncrucial to pre-plan your breaks.<br />\nYou have to allow your brain<br />\ntime to absorb information,\" explained Van Utt. Recall ability of<br />\nreading material can drop to 30<br />\npercent after prolonged, interrupted studying from a peak of 75<br />\npercent. Also, Van Utt pointed<br />\nout that \"taking a break\" meant<br />\nphysically leaving the work site.<br />\nVan Utt stressed the importance of previewing reading<br />\nmaterial. \"Preview\" means to<br />\nread the title, the subheadings, the<br />\nintroduction, the conclusion, and<br />\nthe first sentence of each<br />\nparagraph. Previewing, Van Utt<br />\nsuggested, should be done before<br />\nand after reading the assigned<br />\nmaterial. It is also an effective<br />\nway of studying for an exam.<br />\nWhile previewing, one should<br />\nformulate questions about the<br />\nreading material and relate it to<br />\npreviously learned material.<br />\n\"Your brain can be considered<br />\na series of hooks and the key to<br />\nassimilating information is to link<br />\neverything,\" explained Van Utt.<br />\nTo retain this information, constant review is essential. Van Utt<br />\nrecommended that lecture notes<br />\nbe reviewed after a lecture as<br />\nsoon as possible and also one<br />\nweek later and again one month<br />\nafter.<br />\nShe discouraged combining<br />\nstudying with other activities such<br />\nas as eating and listening to music<br />\nand encouraged studying during<br />\ndaylight hours, instead of late at<br />\nnight.<br /><br />\n\"So she was forced to either<br />\na)sleep at a fraternity house b)get<br />\nraped on the way home or c)ride<br />\nhome with a drunk.\"<br />\nAccording to an employee of<br />\nthe security department, the large<br />\nnumber of calls after two o'clock<br />\nprompted the change in policy.<br />\n\"I've seen what these guys do<br />\nlate at night, they don't do<br />\nanything but drive around campus and check doors,\" one person said.

With the frightening frequency with which Hopkins students are mugged or assaulted<br />\nwithin and without this circle, it is obvious that walking<br />\nhome, for both men and women, is not a logical choice.<br />\nWhat is a logical choice, however, is for the University<br />\nto provide students with a safe means of transportation,<br />\nsince it is the University's lack of housing that forces<br />\nstudents to live off campus in the first place.<br />\nThe escort van does manage to ferry significant numbers<br />\nof students around, but lately, safety seems to be taking<br />\na back seat to laziness.

The numerous complaints about the shuttle not accepting calls before the 2 a.m. deadline, when<br />\ntaken in conjunction with an overall need for a later<br />\ndeadline, illustrates that escort van policies need to be reexamined.

Used oil is collected,<br />\nre-refined and used again.\"Tin\"<br />\ncans, plastic, and batteries are<br />\nalso collected and recycled,<br />\nalthough to recycle these takes a<br />\nlittle more work and is a more<br />\ndifficult process. There are<br />\nothers, too\u2014the above are just a<br />\nfew of the most commonly<br />\nrecycled materials.<br />\nThere are four main factors that<br />\nmake recycling such a key issue.<br />\nOne is the energy that recycling<br />\nsaves\u2014reusing materials versus<br />\nremaking them. In the case of the<br />\naluminum above, 94 percent of<br />\nthe energy it would take to make<br />\nnew cans is saved by recycling<br />\nthem.<br />\nA second major concern is the<br />\nspace that is saved in terms of<br />\ntrash volume. Recycling pulls<br />\nwhat would be trash out of cir-<br /><br />\nculation, reuses it, and puts it<br />\nback into circulation anew. If<br />\nsomething is just thrown away, it<br />\ncan take up a lot of space\u2014<br />\nespecially substances like plastics<br />\nor cans.<br />\nThird, there is the fact that<br />\nrecycling preserves the environment. If you recycle paper, not<br />\nonly do you save landfill space,<br />\nthus preserving land for other<br />\nuses, but you also reduce the need<br />\nto cut down more trees, which in<br />\nturn saves forests and prevents<br />\nsoil erosion. Recycling something<br />\nmeans that you cut down on<br />\npollution and other undesi: able<br />\neffects like ground-water<br />\nleeching.<br />\nFinally, there is simple<br />\neconomics. By recycling<br />\neverybody saves money, both the<br />\nproducers in lower manufacturing costs, and the consumer in<br />\nlower prices. Many recycling<br />\nplants also offer money for bringing in materials. For example,<br />\nglass pays at 2 cents per pound,<br />\naluminum at around 30 cents per<br />\npound and higher. Recycling<br />\nmakes sense for the pocket as<br />\nwell as for the environment.<br />\nPeople have come up with a<br />\nvariety of answers beside recycling. None of these, however, are<br />\neither as effective or as permanent as recycling itself.<br />\nOne of the more popular ideas<br />\nis incinerators. However, these<br />\npotentially create more of a problem than they solve.<br />\nAlthough they burn the trash,<br />\nthey hardly get rid of it. All they<br />\nreally end up doing is reducing<br />\nthe trash volume. The problem<br />\nremains, only now the pollutants<br />\nand toxins are concentrated in the<br />\nash that is left over. Also, some<br />\nof the toxins escape into the atmosphere as air pollution, further<br />\ncomplicating the issue.<br />\nLandfills too are an answer that<br />\npeople have come up with. If<br />\nanything, they too only corn-<br /><br />\nplicate the issue. The substances<br />\nthat go into them are often potent<br />\ntoxins. In addition, landfills fill<br />\nup quickly and take a very, very<br />\nlong time to decay completely.<br />\nPerhaps worst, they are<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nAs Dale Hargrave, a volunteer<br />\nfor the CPHA (one of the leading<br />\nanti-pollution organizations in<br />\nBaltimore), says, \"In many cases<br />\nno one is even certain what is in<br />\nthe landfills. If one of them ever<br />\ncaught fire, or was set on fire,<br />\nthere would be a major problem.<br />\nIt would have to be handled much<br />\nas a chemical spill or nuclear accident is.\"<br />\nDespite the fact that recycling<br />\nhas so many advantages, people<br />\nevery day across the world throw<br />\naway items that are recyclable.<br />\nOrganizations like the CPHA<br />\nhave a hard time making people<br />\nlisten, especially in a city like<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nPeople act as if there's no need<br />\nto conserve what we have. To<br />\nthem it's just trash, not potential<br />\nmaterials or money. Perhaps it's<br />\ndue to ignorance. At least that<br />\nsounds better than the fact that<br />\nthey plain don't care.<br />\nPerhaps the whole issue is best<br />\nsummed up by the comment of<br />\nLora Hall of the Baltimore<br />\nResource Journal when she said<br />\nthat \"of all things, recycling is<br />\none of the ones that will literally<br />\nmake or break our future.\"<br />\nIf you are interested in recycling and wish to get involved, Lora<br />\nHall is interested in hearingfrom<br />\nyou at either 339-7716 or<br />\n337-5525.

Recently, Mayor<br />\nSchmoke announced that the city would begin initiating recycling efforts and October was<br />\ndeclared \"Recycling Month\" in<br />\nBaltimore. So, what exactly is the<br />\ncity doing?<br />\nIf Baltimore were to change its<br />\nslogan to \"The City That<br />\nRecycles,\" it would be a<br />\nmisnomer. Baltimore Magazine's<br />\nNovember issue ran an article<br />\ndealing with recycling and posed the question, \"Would<br />\nBaltimore be the last city in<br />\nAmerica to recycle?\"<br />\nThe city's efforts so far have<br />\nreally only amounted to the<br />\n\"Roll-off Program.\" This program calls for locating recycling<br />\nreceptacles in Baltimore<br />\nneighborhoods. These receptacles<br />\nare a sort of dumpster with different compartments for different<br />\nmaterials such as aluminum,<br />\npaper, and glass.<br />\nThe plan first got under way in<br />\nthe community of Overlea last<br />\nweek, on November 3rd. This<br />\nweek, three new dumpsters will<br /><br />\nbe sited, one to be located at the<br />\nFarmer's Market on 32nd Street<br />\nin Waverly. The proceeds which<br />\ncome from this effort will be put<br />\ntoward tree-planting in and<br />\naround the community.<br />\nThose concerned with the<br />\nrecycling efforts in Baltimore do<br />\nnot think this is enough. Matt<br />\nShaps, the recycling coordinator<br />\nfor Students for Environmental<br />\nAction, says, \"Baltimore is doing very little to promote recycling.\"<br />\nOff-campus sources concur.<br />\n\"The Roll-off Program is a token<br />\nmove, and not really too much of<br />\nan effort,\" says Anneke Davis,<br />\npresident of the Baltimore Environmental Center.<br />\nRobert Pollard, of the Citizens'<br />\nPlanning and Housing Association (CPHA), agrees. \"It's a<br />\nuseful interim step to encourage<br />\nneighborhoods to recycle, but its<br />\nhardly a total solution.\"<br />\nRecycling efforts have been<br />\nlargely done by private organizations rather than the city. The<br />\nCPHA is the recognized leader of<br />\nthe recycling effort in Baltimore,<br />\nhandling everything from public<br />\nawareness to government proposals on how to deal with the<br />\nrecycling efforts. Pollard. who<br />\nreceived his masters degree<br /><br />\nsocial relations from Hopkins in<br />\n1972, is the co-chair of the<br />\nCPHA recycling committee.<br />\nThe CPHA was founded in<br />\n1941 to focus citizen participation<br />\nin city affairs. Early issues with<br />\nwhich it dealt were such things as<br />\nzoning regulations, city planning,<br />\nand education. It sponsors the City Series, a program which<br />\nfocuses attention on important<br />\nissues relevant to the Baltimore<br />\ncommunity. The next installment<br />\nof this series will begin this week,<br />\non November 15th, dealing with<br />\nregional issues in and around<br />\nBaltimore. It is also responsible<br />\nfor the \"Shape-Up Baltimore\"<br />\ncontest to encourage communities<br />\nto clean up and collect trash.<br />\nThe recycling committee was<br />\nformed in September of 1988 due<br />\nto a new interest in the environment. The purpose is primarily to<br />\nconsolidate efforts.<br />\n\"If you're collecting, and your<br />\nneighbors are collecting, why not<br />\nget together with them?\" asks<br />\nPollard. \"No one is opposed to<br />\nit\u2014its only a matter of making it<br />\neasy and practical to do.\"<br />\nPollard is pleased with some of<br />\nthe steps which some divisions of<br />\nBaltimore have taken, inSee BAl TI<br /><br />\nWI 0<br /><br />\nJIM groups begin recycling on campus<br />\nby Kathleen Curry<br /><br />\nScott Needle<br /><br />\nThis man will pay you for your trash.<br /><br />\nrecycling committee, says that<br />\naluminum should be regarded as<br />\nEnvironmental problems used \"a valuable resource.\" Furtherto be something we just, read more, as he explains, mining the<br />\nabout in magazines. \"Ozone ore required to make aluminum<br />\ndepletion\" and \"acid rain\u2022' releases oxides into the atseemed foreign and their solu- mosphere which contribute to<br />\ntions inaccessible.

While many critics, including the<br />\nrecently deceased Virgil Thomson, dismissed him<br />\nshallow<br />\nwho<br />\nperformer<br />\nas<br />\na<br />\naimed only to wow his audience, no one has denied<br />\nthat his mastery of the instrument in technical<br />\nterms has not been surpassed.<br />\nHorowitz was born in Kiev on October 1, 1904.<br />\nAlthough he was trained on the piano from early<br />\nin his youth, his first serious plans leaned toward<br />\na career in composition. It was not until the<br />\nRevolution of 1917 that Horowitz, at the tender<br />\nage of thirteen, was forced to perform frequently<br />\nto earn money for his devastated family.<br />\nHorowitz's yearnings to compose were never<br />\nsquelched by his fame as a pianist, however. His<br />\nmany arrangements, particularly that of Sousa's<br />\n\"Stars and Stripes Forever,\" could be heard as<br />\nencores at his recitals. To the horror of musical<br />\npurists, Horowitz even altered such standards as<br />\nMussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition,\"<br />\nRachmaninoffs \"Piano Sonata no. 2,\" and Liszt's<br />\n\"Mephisto Waltz.\" His response to accusations<br />\nof distorting the music was that he was only peeling away dead material to set free the feeling in<br />\nthe music. \"Mussorgsky was a bit of a dilettante,<br />\nand he was not really a pianist,\" argued Horowitz<br />\nin a 1984 interview. \"The piano is a very funny<br />\ninstrument. You have to know it well.\" That<br /><br />\n.M0<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\nHorowitz knew the piano more intimately than<br />\nMussorgsky can hardly be refuted.<br />\nThe traditions of the Russian school of pianism,<br />\na movement which stemmed from the teachings<br />\nof Anton Rubinstein (1829-1894), could be<br />\nobserved in the Horowitz style. Critic Harold<br />\nSchoenberg labeled the Russian approach as one<br />\nof \"mood projection.\"<br />\nWhile Horowitz's technical ability enabled him<br />\nto create moments of incredible velocity and<br />\nvolume, he was not limited to bravura playing.<br />\nAfter a subtle program of Scarlatti, Mozart, and<br />\nSchumann, one admirer was heard to say, \"He<br />\nis the only pianist who can play colors.\"<br />\nWith such a mixture of nuance in sound and virtuosity, Horowitz was a prime model for imitation. But unlike Liszt, whose playing and teaching<br />\nformed an enduring school of pianism that can be<br />\ntraced to the present day, his style was unique and<br />\nultimately unteachable. His method used flat<br />\nfingers and a flat hand, a position strongly<br />\ndiscouraged in modern piano pedagogy. It was<br />\npartly due to this strange but effective personal<br />\ntrait that Horowitz was never really known as a<br />\nteacher.<br />\nSometimes criticized for his limited repertoire,<br />\nHorowitz was nevertheless a champion in the<br />\n\u2022 music of some previously lesser-known composers. He was instrumental in reviving the piano<br />\nsonatas of Muzio Clementi, and was also a fine<br />\ninterpreter of Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas. During World War II, he premiered the sixth, seventh,<br />\nand eighth sonatas of Sergei Prokofiev in the<br />\nUnited States. In fact, the seventh and eighth<br />\nsonatas were performed at the Russian Consulate;<br /><br />\nsuch interest was sparked that in the front rows<br />\nHorowitz observed Arturo Toscanini, Bruno<br />\nWalter, Leonard Bernstein, Samuel Barber, and<br />\nAaron Copland.<br />\nPerhaps his greatest contribution was his playing, of Russian composer Alexander Scriabin's<br />\nmusic. Horowitz described Scriabin as \"supersensuous, super-romantic, and super-mysterious.\"<br />\nThe Horowitz temperament suited this music<br />\nperfectly, and it is no surprise that his technique<br />\nwas agreeable to Scriabin's music\u2014the composer<br />\nhimself was a fine pianist, once described as \"an<br />\nelegant, light-fingered pianist gifted with a fluent<br />\ntechnique.\" Due to Horowitz's commitment to<br />\nthis music, Scriabin's sonatas are now staples in<br />\nthe international concert repertoire.<br />\nBut Horowitz was not always playing off the<br />\ntrodden path. His American debut, at Carnegie<br />\nHall in 1928, was with a standard war horse,<br />\nTchaikovsky's \"Piano Concerto no. 1.\" \"I chose<br />\nthe Tchaikovsky,\" he said later, \"because I knew<br />\nthat I could make such a wild sound, and I could<br />\nplay it with such speed and noise.\" So much for<br />\nmusicality and subtle nuance! Horowitz continued,<br /><br />\n\"I wanted to eat the public alive; to drive them<br />\ncompletely crazy.\" He certainly began his<br />\nAmerican career with a bang: when conductor<br />\nThomas Meecham's tempo became too moderate<br />\nfor Horowitz to show off, he simply erupted on<br />\nhis own, leaving the orchestra behind in a cloud<br />\nof what one critic called \"smoke from the keys.\"<br />\nThe impression was long-lasting, and persuasive<br />\nenough to ingratiate him with such pianists as<br />\nRachmaninoff, Hoffman, Schnabel, Lhevinne,<br />\nGieseking, and Backhaus, all of whom were in<br />\nattendance.<br />\nWhile Horowitz was never what could be<br />\ndescribed as an intellectual pianist, he nonetheless<br />\nmaintained some musical integrity. His words \"I<br />\nwill not return if I cannot play my best for the<br />\npublic\" shed light on his several sabbatical<br />\nperiods, one of which lasted three years. He certainly was out to wow the public, and he did.<br />\nHarold Schonberg summed it up best: \"No pianist<br />\nof the day brought such sheer, incandescent excitement to the concert platform, and none was<br />\nmore of a legend.\"<br /><br />\nWhen they aren't busy mucking around as moral<br />\ndegenerates, the boys bake chickens for a living<br />\nin their father's restaurant. The way those nutty<br />\nMcDermott boys toss those raw chickens around,<br />\nit's a surprise that the place hasn't been closed<br />\ndown by the health department.<br />\nFather knows best, however, and Jake McDermott(Jim Haynie) has the last laugh. He sells the<br />\nrestaurant out from under his inept sons, muttering about his imminent demise. The whispers of<br />\n\"not wanting to die cooking chickens\" sail way<br />\nover the heads of his dull-witted sons, but the audience can't miss the signal. Even if it is predictable, at least \"Staying Together\" tries to make<br />\nsense: without a restaurant to keep them together,<br />\ntheir father's death registers and gives the boys<br />\na foil for the second half of the film.<br />\nAs the boys react to the leveling of the restaurant<br />\nwith emotions ranging from blind outrage to ignorant outrage, it's difficult not to side with the<br />\nfather. Jake may be a wimp and allow his kids<br />\nto run all over him, but at least he's not stupid.<br />\nUnfortunately, watching the fabulous McDermott<br />\nboys run the restaurant into the ground would have<br />\nmade \"Staying Together\" much better, if oddly<br />\ncomic.<br />\nEven their mother Eileen (Melinda Dillon) admits that each of her three sons seems to have a<br />\nthird of a brain. At one point she cheerily reminds<br /><br />\nthem to have a good supper, and then adds,<br />\n\"Eat!\" It's as if they wouldn't be sure what to<br />\ndo when the food was placed before them. Eileen<br />\nMcDermott probably had to put \"inhale\" and<br />\n\"exhale\" signs over her sons' beds when they<br />\nwere little.<br />\n\"Staying Together\" is a failure because the t<br />\ncharacters aren't smart enough to do anything<br />\nunanticipated. Love may transcend stupidity, but<br />\nthere's no reason to go to the movies, or at least<br />\nthis movie, to see it. One can see that every week<br />\non \"Roseanne,\" and there it's supposed to be<br />\nfunny.<br /><br />\nIES<br /><br />\nA Collection of Dummies<br />\nDo Not a Smart Movie Make<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nThe wacky McDermott boys and their hapless<br />\nparents are at the unfocused center of Lee Grant's<br />\ninsipid \"Staying Together,\" an eminently forgettable piece of mid-November cinematic garbage.<br />\nWith a cast filled predominantly with no-names<br />\nwho are likely to stay that way, \"Staying<br />\nTogether\" aspires to profundity.<br />\nThe botched result has the appeal of a root canal.<br />\nThere are enough characters and plot lines in<br />\n\"Staying Together\" to fill a handful of movies<br />\nand at least a dozen episodes of \"Eight is<br />\nEnough.\" But they're all malnourished and<br />\nscreaming for attention. Writer Monte Merrick<br />\njumps from one story to another with little care.<br />\nIt may have looked good when it was being<br />\nfilmed, but one gets a sense that the film was<br />\nrewritten several times, then hacked to pieces by<br />\nits editors.<br />\nThe three McDermott children, growing up (at<br />\nleast physically) in a small South Carolina town,<br />\nare distinguished only by their degenerate individuality. Brian (Tim Quill), enfant terrible of<br />\nthe McDermott clan, rides a motorcycle and wears<br />\na happy-to-be-here look that one wants to kick off<br />\nhis face.<br />\nBrian is shacking up with Nancy Trainer,an<br />\nunderdog mayoral candidate played by a slightly<br /><br />\nembarassed Stockard Charming. Brian may be seeing her, but he still takes time to visit his son from<br />\na previous liaison with Beth (Sheila Kelley), who<br />\nalso supplies him with marijuana. Got all that?<br />\nMiddle child Kit(Dermot Mulroney) is almost<br />\nlikable. He's a runner, and to great annoyance,<br />\nrunners in small towns seem to run everywhere.<br />\nKit falls for for Beverly Young (Daphne Zuniga),<br />\nwho's engaged to construction foreman and David<br />\nStockman look-alike Kevin Burley (Keith Szarabajka). Even though he's the shy McDermott boy,<br />\nKit still gets the chance to yell a lot and get in<br />\nfights.<br />\nDuncan McDermott (Sean Astin), the<br />\nseventeen-year old baby of the family, is a boozer<br />\nand a pothead. There must be no drinking age in<br />\nSouth Carolina, because Duncan hangs out in the<br />\nsame bar as his parents and every other person<br />\nin the town over the age of twelve. In Duncan's<br />\nintroductory scene, he has just awakened on a park<br />\nbench, covered in his own vomit. How appealing!<br />\nAstin is supposed to lure the teenyboppers to<br />\n\"Staying Together,\" and he's sufficiently smirky<br />\nand hormone-laden. Astin has perfected an absolutely enchanting imitation of Corey Haim; and<br />\nwhile there may not be a good way to imitate<br />\nHaim, it's a bad sign when one watches Astin and<br />\ndiscovers a new appreciation for his work in<br />\n\"Goonies.\"<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nPIANO DUET<br />\nWeekley and Are,anbright, two<br />\npianists who apparently don't<br />\nneed first names, will perform a<br />\nfour-handed recital next Wednesday, Nov. 15, at noon in Shriver<br />\nHall.

With a brief, cheerful<br />\nfrom<br />\n\"Hello<br />\nthere!\"<br />\nvocalist/guitarist Glenn Tilbrook,<br />\nthe band leapt headfirst into an arrangement of 1987's AOR hit,<br />\n\"The Prisoner.\" This was<br />\nfollowed by a mixture of older<br />\nhits with songs from the group's<br />\nnew album, \"frank.\"<br />\nStandouts included an energetic<br />\nperformance of \"Rose I Said,\"<br />\na new tune that seems a natural<br />\nfor college radio airplay, and<br />\n\"Cool For Cats,\" a somewhat<br />\ngoofy but likable song from one<br />\nof the group's early albums. Also<br />\nnotable was a new version of<br /><br />\n\"Hourglass,\" rather different<br />\nfrom, and even catchier than, the<br />\nalbum arrangement.<br />\nThe group sounded very<br />\n\"together,\" something not to be<br />\ntaken for granted, even in a group<br />\nwhose first album was released<br />\nover ten years ago. Squeeze, after<br />\nall, did split up and re-form in the<br />\nmid- 1980s.<br />\nVocalist/guitarist Chris Difford's deep and very English<br />\nvoice still harmonizes as well as<br />\never with Tilbrook's unmistakable, sweet tenor. Pianist<br />\nJulian (\"Jools\") Holland, an exceptional musician who turned up<br />\non Fine Young Cannibals' megahit \"Good Thing\" this summer,<br />\ncontributed solo licks to nearly<br />\nevery song. He delighted the audience of about 2,500 with his<br />\ndistinctive, campy, personal style<br />\nand comments. (Holland is a<br />\nformer BBC talk-show host.)<br />\nSolid support was provided by<br />\ndrummer Gilson Lavis and bass<br />\nplayer Deith Wilkinson.<br /><br />\nIn the final song of the regular<br />\nset, the current Top 40 hit \"If It's<br />\nLove,\" Tilbrook explained to the<br />\ndelighted audience, \"On the<br />\nrecord, there's a lovely chorus<br />\nthat comes in here,\" and sang out<br />\nseparate parts for men and<br />\nwomen to echo. \"Dreamy,\" he<br />\ncommented with a grin, as the<br />\nfans giggled their way through<br />\nthe backing vocal.<br />\nThe final encore capped the concert with a bluesy jam session that<br />\nshifted smoothly into a rendition<br />\nof Squeeze's first major hit,<br />\n\"Tempted.\"<br />\nOverall, the final feeling was of<br />\nthe rock equivalent of understated<br />\nelegance. Squeeze didn't try to<br />\ngive us showy staging or lots of<br />\nmugging for the sake of the audience; rather, they concentrated<br />\non the music. To the fans at<br />\nLoyola's Reitz Arena last<br />\nweekend, the result was a concert<br />\nto he remembered.<br /><br />\nvisually vigorous, sequences that<br />\nseem to hold symbolic<br />\nsignificance. These scenes,<br />\nhowever, completely interrupt<br />\nwhat little flow the film had<br />\nalready established. Case in<br />\npoint: the scene in which a man<br />\n,holding a rusted muffler over his<br />\nhead stands in the street (backed<br />\nby cherubic music) and concentrates his attention on the can collector who tumbles and rages on<br />\na couch on the sidewalk. The entire sequence is completely<br />\nsuperfluous.<br />\nAt the end of the picture, the<br />\ncan collector encounters the<br />\nAbstract Zygote Dancers who,<br />\nafter attacking him, dance an odd<br />\nballet, then retreat into cans<br />\nmarked \"Caution: Genetic<br />\nWaste.\" Afterwards, the<br />\nTrashmonster's aide hands the<br />\ncan collector a book on research<br />\ngenetics. After reading it, the can<br />\ncollector\u2014along with his new<br />\nfriends the Trashmonster and his<br />\naide\u2014jumps triumphantly up and<br />\ndown, swept away in unbridled<br />\nand unexplained joy.<br /><br />\nglance,<br />\nAt<br />\nfirst<br />\n\"Trashmonster\" seems to<br />\noverflow with deep inner meaning that begs to be tied into<br />\ncoherent bundles. Unfortunately,<br />\nrather than twine or even cord,<br />\nTurner chooses spaghetti<br />\nnoodles.<br />\nAt best, the film is fractured<br />\nand disjointed, combining commentary on urban poverty, the<br />\ndangers of waste products, and<br />\neven recycling. These ideas float<br />\nas if suspended in a pile of<br />\nabstract trash. None of them seem<br />\nattached to any sort of resolution.<br />\nThe main problem with<br />\n\"Trashmonster\" is that it tries to<br />\nexist on a sensory level alone,<br />\nforsaking the emotional heart of<br />\nfilmmaking that mingles with the<br />\nmedium's aesthetic aspects. The<br />\nvisual aspects of \"Trashmonster\"<br />\nare successful to an extent.<br />\nDespite the noticeably unsophisticated film equipment,<br />\nTurner manages some interesting<br />\ncamera angles and shots that are<br />\nbold and daring. Dick Turner's<br />\ninteresting soundtrack punctuates<br /><br />\nthe cinematography cleverly. But<br />\nthe novelty of it wears too thin,<br />\ntoo quickly.<br />\nThe acting in this movie is<br />\nsecondary. Since there is no<br />\ndialogue, emotion must be<br />\ntransmitted through mannerism<br />\nand physical expression. Dick<br />\nTurner, as the can collector, performs adequately and no more.<br />\nHis character is merely another<br />\ntool to gain visual effect, as are<br />\nall the characters in the picture.<br />\nThe film decides early on<br />\nagainst developing any sort of<br />\nplot or ideas. Instead, Turner<br />\nsimply throws them out and<br />\nleaves the audience wondering<br />\nabout them, as if they were indistinguishable candy wrappers<br />\nsitting on a lawn. It seems that the<br />\nTurners learned the process of<br />\nfilmmaking with this film: it is<br />\nlargely experimental.

In fact, as the<br />\nopening scene unfolded, \"I know<br />\nwhere that is\" and \"I've been<br />\nthere\" traveled audibly from<br />\nleaning mouths to ears throughout<br />\nthe audience.<br />\nThe storyline of \"Trashmonster,\" if you can call<br />\nit that, is this: genetic waste turned living organism goes out and<br />\nkills some people. It's not quite<br />\nclear how or why it does this; it<br />\njust does. A can collector<br />\nsomehow finds out about this<br />\nmonster later in the film. But<br />\nfrom this point, unfortunately, the<br />\nalready foggy plot turns positively milky.<br />\nThere is a scene toward the<br />\nmiddle of the film in which the<br /><br />\nby Joseph Joon<br />\n\"Trashmonster,\" which<br />\nplayed Oct. 20-22 at the<br />\nMaryland Institute of Art, can be<br />\nforgiven for most of its shortcomings simply because of its low<br />\nbudget and director Henry<br />\nTurner's amateur status. After<br />\nall, the film was billed as part of<br />\nthe Institute's \"Cult and LowBudget\" film series. With this in<br />\nmind, most moviegoers tend to be<br />\nat least somewhat forgiving. One<br />\ncan turn away from occasional<br />\nbad editing, or look at his shoes<br />\nwhen he sees poor and unconvincing costumes. But there are<br />\nflaws\u2014many of them in<br />\n\"Trashmonster\"\u2014that all<br />\nmoviegoers must stand and refuse<br />\nto allow.<br />\nHenry and Dick Turner are a<br /><br />\ncan collector and a man in a white<br />\njacket holding a roll of floor plans<br />\nwalk through the abandoned<br />\nbuilding where the trashmonster<br />\nresides. This scene epitomizes the<br />\nfault which runs through the heart<br />\nof the plot. It is unclear whether<br />\nthe two are searching out the<br />\ntrashmonster or looking at the<br />\nbuilding for some other purpose.<br />\nIt's a confusing moment: for all<br />\nwe know, these men want to open<br />\na brothel or perhaps a tanning<br />\nsalon.

They'll be back on<br />\nNovember 15 and 16. The blood<br />\nused in area hospitals comes only from volunteers, not from<br />\ncommercial blood centers. (Their<br />\ncrop gets purified and processed<br />\ninto other medical products.)<br />\nBlood donation takes about one<br />\nhour. When you check in you will<br />\nreceive a pamphlet explaining<br />\nAIDS and blood donation. If you<br />\n'don't know by now, you cannot<br />\nget AIDS by donating blood since<br />\neach needle is used only once. If<br />\nyou have AIDS, by donating<br />\nthere is a small chance you can<br />\ngive it to someone else. Although<br />\nthe blood is tested for HIV antibodies, the test is about 95 percent reliable. The pamphlet lists<br />\ngroups known to be at risk for<br />\nHIV infection and ask those in<br />\nthose groups not to give blood.<br />\nLater, donors who think they may<br />\nbe in a risk group but don't want<br />\nanyone to know, can mark their<br />\nblood with a \"Do Not<br />\nTransfuse\" barcode and give<br />\nblood as if nothing was wrong.<br />\nAt the Red Cross headquarters,<br />\nthe barcodes are read and the<br />\n\"Do Not Transfuse\" pints are<br />\nthrown away.<br />\nAfter getting a checkup and a<br />\nmedical history, you are handed<br />\na blood bag attached to three<br />\nvials for hepatitis, syphillis, and<br />\nAIDS tests. The bag and vials<br />\ncontain a yellow liquid to prevent<br />\nclotting.<br />\nAfter thoroughly scrubbing<br />\ndown your arm to protect you<br />\nfrom infection, the nurse nudges<br />\na small needle into your arm. In<br />\nfive to ten minutes, the bag and<br />\nvials are filled. When the nurse<br />\ntells you to relax, do it. Nervousness can constrict blood<br /><br />\nvessels, slowing blood flow and<br />\nstretching donation time to as long<br />\nas 15 minutes.<br />\nYour body normally has 10 to<br />\n12 pints of blood. By removing<br />\na pint, the Red Cross has lowered<br />\nyou blood pressure. Since<br />\npressure is what makes the blood<br />\ngo 'round, some dizziness as your<br />\nbrain gets a bit less oxygen than<br />\nit should is normal. There's more<br />\nfluid outside of the circulatory<br />\nsystem, and by lying still for a<br />\nfew minutes, you give it a chance<br />\nto flow into the system and pump<br />\nup your pressure. The Red Cross<br />\nrecommends extra fluids before<br />\nand after donation to help the process along.<br />\nWhile you drink your water<br />\nand juice and eat your cookies<br />\n(sugar to replace the blood sugar<br />\nyou donated), your pint is put in<br />\na cooler where it waits for a Red<br />\nCross volunteer to take it back to<br />\nthe lab.<br />\nAt the lab, the bag goes one<br />\nway and the vials go another.<br />\nThey are labled with a donor<br />\nnumber, and the blood products<br />\nfrom the bag do not go out until<br />\nthe tests on the vials are complete. Donors also keep a copy of<br />\ntheir number, and if they decide<br />\nlater that their blood might be unsafe, they can call and<br />\nanonymously tell the Red Cross<br />\nnot to transfuse the blood.<br />\nDonated blood is almost always<br />\nseparated into components, which<br />\nis both economical and useful to<br />\npatients who need only part of the<br />\nblood. Red cells are transfused<br />\nduring surgery and into anemic<br />\npatients. Plasma is also used during surgery, as well as in burn patients who dehydrate rapidly since<br />\nthey lack the waterproofing of the<br />\nskin. Platelets are given to patients whose own platelets are<br />\ndefective.

The cylinder<br />\nturns as the light moves across the original. A reflection of the<br />\nlight hits the rotating cylinder. Black paper doesn't reflect light,<br />\nand white paper does. Thus only the parts of the cylinder which<br />\ncorrespond to the white parts of the paper are illuminated. The<br />\nlight neutralizes the parts of the cylinder it hits, leaving the parts<br />\nof the cylinder corresponding to black on the original with<br />\nnegative charge. Positively charged toner powder is brushed<br />\nacross the cylinder, where it sticks to the negative charge. The<br />\ncylinder rolls over a fresh sheet of paper, which is heated to<br />\nmake the toner powder adhere to the copy.<br /><br />\nIt was an endless palette of exotic colors so intoxicatingly<br />\nbeautiful, I was left breathless.<br />\nSunlight spilled through shaggy<br />\nclouds lending an ethereal sparkle<br />\nto the Amazon rainforest. As the<br />\nsmall riverboat floated down the<br />\nvein of the Amazon River, I<br />\ncould hear hissing echoes of the<br />\nfires destroying this beauty.<br />\nForest destruction alters the<br />\nlocal climate by reducing the<br />\nwater circulating between the<br />\ntrees and the clouds, and adds to<br />\nthe atmospheric burden of carbon<br />\ndioxide. Furthermore, the lives of<br />\nmore than one million species of<br />\nthe earth's biological and genetic<br />\nheritage will soon be lost because<br />\nof this environmental exploitation. Even worse, the hope of<br />\nameliorating these horrific conditions depends on one of the most<br />\ncorrupt goverments in Latin<br />\nAmerica\u2014Brazil.<br />\nBrazil's militant president Jose<br />\nSarney has suffered lately for<br />\nallowing the rainforest to be<br />\ndestroyed. But Brazil is in an<br />\neconomic crisis: a $1 II billion<br />\nforeign debt and a staggering<br />\n17,903 percent domestic inflation<br />\nrate. Dr. Declan DePoar, expert<br />\ngeologist and professor of the<br />\nGlobal Warming Theory class,<br />\ncomments, \"We have to deal<br />\nwith the fact that the Third World<br />\nhas aspirations to acheive our<br />\nlevel of standard of living. And<br />\nif we don't tackle that problem<br />\nthen we can't solve the problem<br />\nof the Earth as a whole.\"<br />\nThe deforestation of the<br />\nAmazon basin is of particular importance because of the role it<br />\nplays in the greenhouse effect\u2014<br />\nthe trapping of the heat by atmospheric carbon dioxide. The<br />\nAmazon stores more than 75<br />\nbillion tons of carbon dioxide in<br />\nits trees. When the trees are burned, carbon dioxide is then spewed in the air, thus ultimately<br />\nmagnifying the greenhouse effect<br />\nat an incredible rate.<br />\nIn recent years, climatologists<br />\nhave detected evidence of instability in the current global<br />\nclimate. One such indicator is the<br />\nincrease in the volume of carbon<br />\ndioxide, a very influential component of the Earth's ability to retain heat, in the atmosphere. The<br />\nEarth has already warmed by<br />\nmore than half a degree celsius<br />\nsince the mid-1800s. A further increase of 1.5\u00b0C-4.5\u00b0C is<br />\npredicted within five decades.<br />\nThis may not seem like much, but<br />\nit will be the highest the Earth<br />\nwill have reached in the last one<br />\nhundred thousand years. Small<br />\ndifferences<br />\nin<br />\naverage<br />\ntemperature make huge differences in the climate. The last<br />\nice age, which reached its peak<br />\n18,000 years ago, was only 3<br />\ndegrees colder than today.<br />\nThe greenhouse effect was first<br />\ndescribed in 1827 by French<br />\nmathematician Jean Baptiste<br />\nFourier. He pointed out that the<br />\nEarth's atmosphere acts like a<br />\ntransparent cover of a box. Gases<br />\nin the atmosphere allow sunlight<br />\nthrough to heat the surface of the<br />\nearth, called greenhouse gases,<br />\nbut traps some of the warmth that<br />\nradiates back. An increase in the<br />\nconcentration of these gases<br />\ntranslates into an increase in the<br />\nheat retained by the planet. This<br />\nextra heat will eventually melt the<br />\nEarth's reflecting surfaces, the<br />\npolar caps. By reflecting solar<br />\nheat, they keep the earth cool.<br />\nDarker, blue water and more<br />\ngreen vegetation, the result of the<br />\nmelted ice, will absorb even more<br />\nheat thus again increasing the<br />\ntemperature.<br />\nWhat are some of these<br />\ngreenhouse gases, and where do<br />\nthey come from? One greenhouse<br />\ngas that is of great concern is the<br />\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).<br />\nThis gas is the result of modern<br />\ntechnology\u2014such human inventions as aerosols, refrigerators,<br />\nair conditioners, solvents for the<br />\ncomputer industry, sterilants for<br />\nmedical supplies. Although their<br />\natmospheric concentration is<br />\nminute, they block much more<br />\nthan carbon dioxide. In the opinion of one expert, halting the use<br />\nof CFCs would be \"the one<br />\nsingle step we could take im-<br /><br />\nmediately that would make a<br />\nstrong positive contribution to<br />\nreducing the greenhouse effect.\"<br />\noccurring<br />\nNaturally<br />\ngreenhouse gases that are major<br />\ncontributors to the warming effect<br />\nare methane, nitrous oxide, and<br />\nozone. Methane is produced by<br />\nbacteria which live in an oxygenfree environmemt such as the bottom of marshes, rice patties, and<br />\nin the gut of animals like cows,<br />\nsheep, and camels. A typical<br />\ndomestic cow produces about 200<br />\nliters of methane a day. Leakages<br />\nfrom gas pipes, coal mines, and<br />\nother underground sources are<br />\nhuman contributions to the<br />\namount of methane in the air.<br />\nForty-five percent of the nitrous<br />\nacid, once used as a dental<br />\nanaesthetic (more commonly<br />\nknown as laughing gas), present<br />\nin the air comes from the combustion of fossil fuels, and the<br />\ncultivation of the soil and the use<br />\nof nitrogenous fertilizers. Ozone,<br />\nfound in the lower atmosphere,<br />\nis created by sunlight acting on<br />\nfossil fuel pollutants from cars<br />\nand other sources.<br />\nThe major contributing<br />\ngreenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.<br />\nCarbon, the basis of most life on<br />\nthe planet, is found in rocks, soil,<br />\nwater, plant and animal life, and<br />\nthe atmosphere. Plants use<br />\nphotosynthesis to get the carbon<br />\nthey need to build their cells from<br />\nthe atmosphere. Animals get carbon by eating plants or other<br />\nanimals. Carbon is returned to the<br />\natmosphere when animals breathe<br />\nand when plants are burned or<br />\ndecay.<br />\nThe world is facing a population explosion that will have an<br />\nimportant effect on the increase<br />\nof the greenhouse gases. Professor DePaor explains, \"Most<br />\npeople perhaps don't realize that<br />\nin 3 or 4 years time, the Earth's<br />\npopulation will have increased by<br />\nan amount equal to the population<br />\nof the U.S.A. And there won't be<br />\na new frontier, a new world in<br /><br />\nwhich to put all these new people.\" Demand on land, on natural<br />\nresources, and an increase in the<br />\nproduction and use of modern<br />\ntechnological products will alter<br />\nthe Earth's geographical and<br />\nclimatic systems.<br />\nIt is the responsibility of the inhabitants of this planet to cultivate<br />\nthe abundant but limited<br />\nresources and beauty that we are<br />\nprivileged to have to enjoy. My<br />\nbrief excursion to the Amazon<br />\nRainforest has made me more<br />\ncognizant of the destruction and<br />\nmutilation we have inflicted on<br />\nour planet. The Amazon, left<br />\nalone, is a self-sustaining<br />\necosystem that can thrive indefinitely. Deforestation of the<br />\nAmazon will eventually lead to<br />\nthe self-destruction of the rainforest; heat, drying,and wind will<br />\ncause the trees to die on their<br />\nown.<br />\nThe rainforest travesty has<br />\nalready produced a martyr, Chico<br />\nMendes. Mendes, leader of the<br />\nrubber tappers, was murdered for<br />\ntrying to stand in the ways of ranchers. He died to stop<br />\ndeforestation and to preserve the<br />\nway of life he and many others<br />\nlived. Rubber tappers are living<br />\nproof that the poor can maintain<br />\na reasonable standard of living<br />\nwithout the destruction of the<br />\nrainforest.<br />\nThe battle to stop deforestation in Amazonia is also being<br />\nfought here, at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe weapons used are not guns<br />\nbut education, understanding, and<br />\nthe power of the voice of the<br />\nstudents that can influence the<br />\npoliticians on Capitol Hill to take<br />\nmore aggressive w !\u2022 ns to deal<br />\nwith the environmental problems<br />\nthe U.S. and other countries have<br />\ncreated. The Students for Environmental Action are highly active in voicing their views and informing other concerned Hopkins<br />\nstudents and professors about environmental problems through<br />\nguest speakers. Just recently, Lisa<br /><br />\nNowakowski, the Maryland<br />\nspokesperson for the Rainforest<br />\nAction Network, gave a powerful and informative presentation<br />\nabout rainforest destruction. She<br />\nurged people to care for their environment and to take action to<br />\nmake this world a better place to<br />\nlive.<br />\nThe Students for Environmental Action is just a small representative of the many concerned<br />\nstudents here at Hopkins.<br />\nEvidence of this concern is<br />\nwitnessed by the overwhelming<br />\nnumber of students that have<br />\nregistered for \"Global Warming<br />\nTheory,\" \"Planet Earth,\" and<br />\nto<br />\n\"Introduction<br />\nOceanography.\" This fall 146<br />\nenrolled in \"Global Warming\"<br />\nand even more importantly,<br />\nremarks Dr. DePaor,\"is the enthusiasm students have shown for<br />\nthe subject. We certainly seem to<br />\nhave come out of the Reagan Era<br />\nof self-interest. I see analogies<br />\nbetween the current student<br />\npopulation and the population of<br />\nthe sixties. But this current<br />\npopulation is much more<br />\nsophisticated. The sixties, the<br />\nflower-power community were<br />\nrelatively naive. Well intentioned but not well-educated in the<br />\nscience of the earth. This generation has the sixties kind of spirit<br />\nplus an eighties attitude towards<br />\nunderstanding of the earth.\"<br />\nCertainly, next fall the Global<br />\nWarming Theory class will be offered. Professor DePaor jokingly comments, \"I don't think the<br />\nchairman [Department of Earth<br />\nand Planetary Sciences] will<br />\nallow me to drop it. I'm enjoying teaching the class very much.<br />\nI've taught large classes before in<br />\nIreland in geology to engineers,<br />\nbut the\" didn't quite have the<br />\nsame entilusiasm for the subject<br />\nas this class has. . .

Eight<br />\nseniors had departed, leaving<br />\nnumerous positions vacant, and<br />\nthe squad was omitted from the<br />\nSouth's preseason top ten.<br />\n\"Almost everyone on the team<br />\nwas somebody who had never<br />\nstarted before, or had to move to<br />\na new position,\" said senior tricaptain John Dengler. But coach<br />\nJohn Haus, assistant coach Mark<br />\nButler, and the Jays ignored<br />\npredictions and trained to win.<br />\nThe season started poorly,<br />\nthough, as local Division I rival<br />\nTowson State downed Hopkins<br />\nthe<br />\non<br />\nturf at Homewood, 3-1.<br />\n\"It was disappointing that we<br />\ndidn't play well,\" said freshman<br />\nsweeper Mike VandeKieft,<br />\n'because it would have given us<br /><br />\nthe opportunity to make some<br />\nnoise at the beginning of the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nA 2-0 triumph at St. Mary's<br />\nevened Hopkins' mark. The team<br />\nthen hosted Washington &amp; Lee<br />\nand Carnegie-Mellon in the Blue<br />\nJay Classic.

Although Matt \"Juice\"<br />\nNewton vomited at the bike race,<br />\nno BIA official produced physical<br />\nevidence, so better luck next time<br />\nMatt.
