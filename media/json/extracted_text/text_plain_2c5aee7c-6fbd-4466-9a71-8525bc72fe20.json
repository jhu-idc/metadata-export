From the student standpoilit such a practice is altogether<br />\n-legitimate. The exams of the previous year usually provide nothing<br />\nmore than a guide or outline for preparation. Seldom do the<br />\nsame questions re-appear; often the two exams are completely<br />\ndifferent. However not every student has the previous exams<br />\navailable for his study consideration. If the instructor happens<br />\nto repeat the same exam, the relation of wades is unfair.

Seldom do the<br />\nsame questions re-appear; often the two exams are completely<br />\ndifferent. However not every student has the previous exams<br />\navailable for his study consideration.
