The committee, which is<br />\nobviously not political or partisan in nature, is a group<br />\nwith only one purpose\u2014to save 1,214 lives.<br />\nThe objections to the formation of this group and to<br />\nits avowed goal are both silly and sad. The United States<br />\nand its citizens can only gain by freeing the prisoners.<br />\nAnd the fact that private citizens of this country are willing to donate their time, services, and names in such a<br />\ncause is a tribute to them and to the ideals for which<br />\nthis country stands.<br />\nWhether Castro is acting in good faith or not is<br />\ndebatable. As Dr. Eisenhower mentioned, with the equipment he is demanding Castro could plow all of Cuba within<br />\none week. But this is hardly the major issue.

It<br />\nindicates that about one fourth of the firms will hang out<br />\n\"no vacancy\" signs, half will restrict hiring only to close<br />\nrelatives of employes and good Customers, and the remaining fourth will accept considerably fewer summer employes<br />\nthan in past years.<br />\nOn this pessimistic note, we wish our many faithful<br />\nreaders happy hunting and a most pleasant summer vacation.

Unfortunately, some of<br />\nBaltimore's most imaginative<br />\nand polished artists such as<br />\nAaron Sopher, Reuben Kramer,<br />\nJacob Gushakow, and Joseph<br />\nShepard did not exhibit; however, one was continually reminded of their respective style,<br />\nand those of Dali and Picasso,<br />\nby numerous imitations.<br />\nDespite such a poor showing,<br />\nthere were a few paintings of<br />\nmerit on display. \"Galley One,\"<br />\n<br />\na group of six or seven highly<br />\nabstractionists, disoriginal<br />\nplayed modern paintings and<br />\ndrawings of high artistic quality.<br />\nRobert Owings exhibited some<br />\namusing cartoons of the beat<br />\ngeneration.

This increase over<br />\nthe past two years is not due to<br />\nany shift in admissions policy,<br />\nbut rather to a more active concern on the part of the athletic<br />\ncoaches and alumni who were<br />\nworried about the lack of depth<br />\nexhibited 'ay the last two,freshman lacrosse teams.<br />\nIn conclusion Mr. Bilgrave<br />\nstated that he expected the entering class to be about 400<br />\nfreshman of which 60% should<br />\nbe non Maryland residents and<br />\n40% Maryland residents.

The committee, which is<br />\nobviously not political or partisan in nature, is a group<br />\nwith only one purpose\u2014to save 1,214 lives.<br />\nThe objections to the formation of this group and to<br />\nits avowed goal are both silly and sad. The United States<br />\nand its citizens can only gain by freeing the prisoners.<br />\nAnd the fact that private citizens of this country are willing to donate their time, services, and names in such a<br />\ncause is a tribute to them and to the ideals for which<br />\nthis country stands.<br />\nWhether Castro is acting in good faith or not is<br />\ndebatable. As Dr. Eisenhower mentioned, with the equipment he is demanding Castro could plow all of Cuba within<br />\none week. But this is hardly the major issue. If we refuse<br />\nCastro's offer and allow the 1,214 men to die because we<br />\nsuspect the motives of the Cuban dictator, we have<br />\nblatantly ignored our moral and humanitarian responsibilities.<br />\nFor this reason we urge everyone, student and<br />\nfaculty, to contribute to \"Tractors For Freedom.\" By such<br />\ncontributions we of the Hopkins community can reaffirm<br />\nour often heralded moral leadership in Baltimore and<br />\nthe nation.<br /><br />\nHappy Hunting<br />\nAs we put away our typewriters for a short summer<br />\nintermission, we noticed a recent survey by a business<br />\nmagazine shows that the summer employment situation<br />\nfor college students will be \"the tightest in years.\" The<br />\nsurvey covers twenty-five large corporations and numerous<br />\ncollege employment counselors throughout the country.

Forgetting<br />\nfor a moment the few examples<br />\nof what might be properly called<br />\nart, it appears that the genus<br />\nopifex mediocris is the hardiest<br />\nof the species, having edged out<br />\neven the wildly flamboyant species pictor spurcus oppressus-nik<br />\nwhich is used to add color and<br />\ninterest to shows of this sort.<br />\n(This is a joke.) By far the<br />\nmajority of works exhibited were<br />\nof a realist, semi-realist, neorealist, or pseudo-realist nature.<br />\nOf the few adventurous souls<br />\nwho dared to attempt nonobjective or surrealist technique,<br />\nmost of them seemed to have<br />\nforgotten, or to never have<br />\nlearned the basic principles of<br />\ndesign, color, dynamics, and<br />\nbalance. Unfortunately, some of<br />\nBaltimore's most imaginative<br />\nand polished artists such as<br />\nAaron Sopher, Reuben Kramer,<br />\nJacob Gushakow, and Joseph<br />\nShepard did not exhibit; however, one was continually reminded of their respective style,<br />\nand those of Dali and Picasso,<br />\nby numerous imitations.<br />\nDespite such a poor showing,<br />\nthere were a few paintings of<br />\nmerit on display. \"Galley One,\"<br /><br />\na group of six or seven highly<br />\nabstractionists, disoriginal<br />\nplayed modern paintings and<br />\ndrawings of high artistic quality.<br />\nRobert Owings exhibited some<br />\namusing cartoons of the beat<br />\ngeneration.
