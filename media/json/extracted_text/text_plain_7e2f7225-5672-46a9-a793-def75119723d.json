But that is not<br />\nthe really objectionable feature to our thinking. We are students in the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, and when we behave in such a way that all Baltimore laughs at us we put ourselves on the level of the petty colleges located in this city. Nothing better can be expected<br />\nof them. More ought rightly to be expected of us.

Although the writer<br />\nof the editorial was ignorant of the fact, such a Conversational Class has<br />\nbeen conducted here for years. We are not altogether to be blamed<br />\nfor this mistake as the NEWS-LETTER printed an editorial on much<br />\nthe same subject last year without causing comment from the German Department.

It<br />\nis interesting to note that in no nation have<br />\nthe people generally, ever looked upon smuggling as a question of right or wrong. \"The<br />\nsmuggler was always regarded as a benefactor,<br />\nbecause the people believed that he supplied<br />\nbetter articles at a cheaper rate, than those<br />\non which excise duties were paid. A writer<br />\nwho was rather partial to smugglers has said,<br />\nspeaking of the time when this practice was at<br />\nits highest point, \"To pretend to have any<br />\nscruple about buying smuggled goods would<br />\nbe regarded as a pedantic piece of hypocrisy.\"<br />\nThe smuggler himself was often a popular<br />\nfavorite, and there have been many romantic<br />\nstories connected with smugglers and their<br />\ntrade.<br />\nIn England smuggling appeared for the first<br />\ntime, during the thirteenth century, when<br />\ncounterfeit money began to be introduced<br />\nfrom abroad. This offence was declared a<br />\ntreason, and legislation on the subject was<br />\nactive for many years. Smuggling of wine,<br />\nspirits, tobacco, and money was practiced continually all around the coast. The Isle of<br />\nMan became the centre of so extensive a<br />\nsmuggling trade that the island was finally<br />\npurchased by the British Government at<br />\nenormous expense.<br />\nEnglish goods were often sent into France<br />\nthrough Belgium. Dogs were trained to carry<br />\nvaluable packages across the border; it is said<br />\nthat one dog could easily carry merchandise<br />\nworth one hundred and fifty dollars. The<br />\nFrench Government put an end to this method<br />\nof smuggling, by offering a reward of three<br />\nfrancs for every dog seized.<br />\nMost of the smuggling trade in England<br />\nand Scotland was done along the coast.<br />\nRevenue officers constantly patrolled the<br />\nshores, yet were often deceived by the keener<br />\nwits of the more experienced fishermen. In<br />\none sea-port of England, on a rocky coast,<br />\nwhere there were was only one harbor into<br />\nwhich a ship might be run at night, land her<br />\ncargo and hurry away before the officers knew<br />\nof her approach, there is a story, that a scheme<br />\nwas once cunningly planned by the smugglers<br />\nto kill many of their enemies, the Revenue<br />\n<br />\nofficers, and at the same time land their cargo<br />\nin safety. The report was spread so as to<br />\ncome to the officers' ears, that a cargo was to<br />\nbe landed in \"The Cove\" on a certain night.<br />\nThe Revenue officers concealed a party of men<br />\nnear the inlet, and then put out to sea in their<br />\nvessel, determined to seize the smugglers'<br />\nship in the act of running a cargo.<br />\nThe approach to the harbor was by a narrow channel; and, if a cargo was to be landed<br />\non a dark night, the smugglers' friends on<br />\nshore lighted beacons on either side of the<br />\nsmall bay, to act as guides for the vessel about<br />\nto \"run the cargo.\" This the officers on<br />\nboard the Revenue cutter knew and, having<br />\ncaught sight of the lights on the smugglers'<br />\nship, gave chase. The smuggler easily held<br />\nher own, and when nearing the rocky coast,<br />\nwhere the beacons were plainly visible, suddenly extinguished her lights. The Revenue<br />\nofficers, supposing that the smuggler was<br />\nmaking for the harbor, followed in quick pursuit, using the beacons on either side of the<br />\nchannel, as their guide. Suddenly the crew<br />\nheard the roar of breakers, and made every<br />\neffort to regain the open sea. It was useless,<br />\nhowever, and the vessel was wrecked, the<br />\nwhole of the crew being drowned, excepting<br />\nonly two or three men. It was afterwards<br />\nlearned that the smugglers, knowing that the<br />\nbeacons had been falsely placed on a high<br />\ncliff, and not on either side of the bay, had<br />\nturned sharply to one side when they extinguished their lights, and had avoided the<br />\ndestruction to which they knew the Government vessel was doomed. Afterwards the<br />\nparty of officers on shore was driven away by<br />\nthe smugglers, the cargo being safely landed<br />\nlater on in the night.<br />\nThe fishermen engaged in this perilous<br />\ntrade were usually of the roughest sort, and it<br />\nis said that, if a vessel was wrecked, these<br />\npeople would often refuse to give any aid to<br />\nthe sufferers, considering the shipwreck as a<br />\npiece of good 'fortune, and the vessel and its<br />\ncargo as their lawful prize.<br />\nIn Scotland the officials whose duty it was<br />\nto collect the inland taxes on home products,<br />\nwere called \"excisemen\" and they were also<br />\nsupposed to prevent the smuggling of contraband goods into the country. Robert Burns<br />\nwas at one time an \"excisemen\" and proved<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhimself an excellent officer. On one occasion<br />\nhe placed himself at the head of a troop of<br />\ndragoons, crossed the Solway, was the first to<br />\nboard a smuggling brig, captured it, and had<br />\nthe vessel sold at Dumfries.<br />\nIn India opium has been smuggled far more<br />\nthan any other article. In this case, the<br />\nsmugglers do not attempt to introduce the<br />\nopium by importing it from other countries,<br />\nbut raise it in the inland districts, and try to<br />\nsmuggle it into the large towns, where, if<br />\nsuccessful, they may obtain very high prices.<br />\nNo one is allowed to raise opium without a<br />\ncostly permit from the Government, and there<br />\nare so many Government inspectors continually<br />\non the watch for this trade that smugglers<br />\n,find it difficult to obtain the opium. It seems<br />\nthat opium has a very peculiar smell which is<br />\neasily detected by any one familiar with it.<br />\nFarmers have been discovered on railway<br />\ntrains carrying bags apparently full of onions,<br />\nbut even the odor of the onions was not strong<br />\nenough to draw entirely the opium concealed<br />\nin the centre of the bags.<br />\nA case of smuggling opium abroad from the<br />\nUnited States was discovered in a somewhat<br />\nunusual way. A milkman who carried the<br />\nmilk on board of out-going steamers was frequently noticed talking to a convicted smuggler. This aroused the suspicions of a<br />\nGovernment inspector, who carelessly jolted<br />\nthe milkman as he was carrying a can on board<br />\nof a vessel about to sail, knocking the can to<br />\nthe pavement. The inspector learned from<br />\nthe sound that the can was not hollow, but<br />\nsolid. He immediately cabled to the ship's<br />\ndestination, and the inspectors there discovered<br />\nthat many of the niilk-cans were filled with<br />\nopium.<br />\n- At the present time the duty on most<br />\nimported articles has been lessened until smuggling is confined chiefly to tobacco, precious<br />\nstones, gloves and laces.<br />\nJewels are smuggled into this country in<br />\nseveral ways. It does not seem difficult to<br />\ncarry uncut diamonds in one's pockets, conceal them in the hair, or put them in the heel<br />\nof a shoe, but it is found that persons doing<br />\nthis cannot avoid giving suspicion and being<br />\ndetected.<br />\nLaces are sometimes smuggled by being<br />\nplaced in the false bottom of a trunk. These<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nfalse bottoms are not usually more than one<br />\ninch in thickness, and cannot be noticed from<br />\nthe outside except after very close examination.<br />\nGloves has been hidden in the sleeves of a<br />\ncoat, or sent in letters by mail, and in one<br />\ninstance a large can of gloves was found in<br />\nthe middle of a barrel of pitch.<br />\nPerhaps the most ingenious plans are used<br />\nin smuggling cigars and tobacco. The panelling in officers' cabins has sometimes been<br />\nremoved, the space being filled with cigars,<br />\nbrandy, or rum. About twenty bales of<br />\nSumatra tobacco were recently discovered,<br />\nhidden under the coal in the bunkers of a<br />\nsteamship. If any of the officers or crew is<br />\ncaught in the act of smuggling, the articles<br />\nare not only confiscated, but a heavy fine is<br />\nalso imposed. If the crew of a vessel can be<br />\nbribed, however, packages may be lowered<br />\noverboard into a waiting launch, usually very<br />\nlong and painted black, so as not to be<br />\nnoticeable at night. On one occasion the<br />\nauthorities were notified that a large amount<br />\nof cigars was to be smuggled, and an extra<br />\nnumber of men was detailed to make sure that<br />\nthe attempt would not be successful.<br />\nA rubber bag containing five thousand<br />\ncigars was lowered overboard at night from<br />\na vessel in the harbor, caught by a row-boat,<br />\ntowed to the dock, and landed without attracting attention. The sailor who landed the<br />\ncigars was walking up the dock, carrying the<br />\nlarge bundle under his arm, when he was<br />\narrested by a city policeman as a suspicious<br />\ncharacter. The fraud was soon discovered by<br />\nthe city authorities and the Government inspectors who were still watching for the smugglers, were informed to their great chagrin,<br />\nthat the prey had already been captured.<br />\nA peculiar manner of smuggling diamonds<br />\nis said to have been used at one time, as follows. The Government was notified that a<br />\nparty consisting of a man, his wife, a baby,<br />\nand its nurse would attempt to import several<br />\nvery valuable uncut diamonds without paying<br />\nthe duty. The four were carefully watched<br />\nby detectives, but nothing suspicious could be<br />\nfound.

He graduated from<br />\nColumbia in 1883, and after several years of<br />\ngraduate study, spent two years in Germany.<br />\nOn his return, he was appointed an associate<br />\nin English literature which position he occupied<br />\nuntil 1895, when he accepted the chair of<br />\nJudo-Iranian languages. This position he<br />\nholds today. He has travelled in India,<br />\nPersia, and Central Asia, mainly for the purposes of research. He has published several<br />\nvolumes relating to Persia, and other subjects<br />\nin his special line of research, and has contributed largely to various learned periodicals.<br />\nDuring the course of his career he has done a<br />\ngood deal of public lecturing and was, we<br />\nbelieve, invited to give the Turnbull Lecturers<br />\nseveral winters ago, but at that time found it<br />\nimpossible to do so.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE ALUMNUS' STORY.<br />\n\"Yes,\" said the returned Alumnus, as we<br />\nseated ourselves in a retired corner of the<br />\nlibrary, \"this is how it all happened. One<br />\nmorning in October in my first post-graduate<br />\nyear they found the photograph of the last<br />\nyear's senior class\u2014my class\u2014broken from its<br />\nframe, torn up, and strewn over the floor<br />\naround the place where it had been hanging,<br />\nin McCoy Hall, second floor, right there by<br />\nthe Dean's room, you know. I had left for<br />\nEurope three days after the photograph had<br />\nbeen taken in June, and had consequently not<br />\nseen the picture until the Fall.<br />\n\"Well, they talked about the destruction of<br />\nthe photograph for a week or two, but no one<br />\never arrived at any conclusion because there<br />\nwas only one man who knew how the picture<br />\nhad been damaged, and that was myself.<br />\n'Since my earliest days I had had an almost<br />\nuncontrollable dislike of being on the left side<br />\nof a group'of people. At home my place had<br />\nalways been at the right side of the diningtable; and in my football days I always insisted upon playing in the right side of the<br />\nline. It is impossible to describe to you the<br />\ncurious feeling of dread that used to possess<br />\nme whenever I found myself misplaced in a<br />\ngroup; I might compare it to homesickness in<br />\nits worst form\u2014a feeling that one must do<br />\nsomething or die. As I look back upon it I<br />\ncannot think it simply childish, for as the rest<br />\nof my story will show, it contained very<br />\nserious possibilities.<br />\n\"When the photograph was taken I placed<br />\nmyself in the right side of the group and<br />\nthought no more about it. But when in October I saw the print for the first time, I perceived that as the photograph was taken from<br />\nthe front of the group I was represented on<br />\nthe left side of Ike picture! Then I realized<br />\nfor the first time the strange fact that this<br />\nmental antipathy extended not only to my<br />\nphysical being but even to the pictorial representation of myself. I struggled with all my<br />\nwill-power against the nervous terror that<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nbegan to come over me, but in vain. It increased hourly until from a mere incidental<br />\nidea it became a dominant force, and until- in<br />\na few days I was suffering more acutely than<br />\nany physical pain could cause.<br />\n\"Perhaps you have observed that curious<br />\nstate between waking and dreaming when the<br />\nimagination runs riot and the brain, while<br />\nperfectly conscious, cannot c on trol the<br />\nthoughts. Under the influence of such a<br />\nstate I have at times imagined myself dizzily<br />\nspinning around, top-fashion, and although<br />\nquite aware that it was only fancy I have been<br />\nquite unable to compel the imagination to<br />\ncease its working. Such a state lasts only a<br />\nfew minutes, till sleep or perfect consciousness puts an end to it; at the time of which I<br />\nam telling you I was in a similar condition,<br />\nwhich lasted for days. I could not overcome<br />\nwhat I knew to be only a delusion, an interesting case for the psychopathologist. I attended<br />\nmy classes, and performed my daily duties<br />\nregularly, but the things of reality were but a<br />\ndream, while the dream had all the aspects of<br />\nreality.<br />\n\"One day about six o'clock, as I came down<br />\nthe corridor from the Seminary, where I had<br />\nbeen doing some late work, my eyes fell upon<br />\nthe picture. The wild feeling of mental and<br />\nphysical distortion came over me with<br />\nredoubled force. How can I make it clear to<br />\nyou? It seemed as if I should have been by<br />\nall rule and right in the other side of the<br />\ngroup; that a force greater than myself had<br />\ndragged me away from my place, straining<br />\nevery nerve and fibre in my body. I imagine<br />\nthat my thoughts were like the thoughts of a<br />\nman who awakes from a trance and realizes<br />\nin one brief instant of mental clearness that<br />\nthey have nailed the coffin-lid down and cast<br />\nthe clods upon him.<br />\n\"And there was the frame, directly within<br />\nmy reach\u2014<br />\n`With the rattle of broken glass I came to<br />\nmy senses. I left the hall in a state of considerable excitement, and have never had a<br />\nreturn of this astonishing malady.\u2014I'm<br />\nawfully obliged to you, for taking me over<br />\nthe old place again; it certainly has changed<br />\nsince I first cribbed my Horace and mixed<br />\npoison in the chemical lab. So long.\"<br />\nI wonder if it all did happen?<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE TRACK TEAM.<br />\nThe track season is well under way now,<br />\nand judging from the work of the men who<br />\nare out for the team, the present season should<br />\nbe a most successful one. Our distance men,<br />\nBreyer and Brenton, have already scored a<br />\ntriumph for Hopkins, when they won first and<br />\nsecond places in the open cross-country run<br />\nheld by Georgetown, on January 1. This<br />\nvictory of our distance runners was a notable<br />\none, for they were in competition with some<br />\nof the best distance men in the East; in fact<br />\nit was a Yale man who won third place.<br />\nThere is one thing noticed among the candidates for the track team, and that is the<br />\nsmall number of Freshmen who are coming<br />\nout for practice. Often there are one or two,<br />\nand on rare occasions three or four Freshmen<br />\npracticing in the cage on track afternoons.<br />\nThe question, \"What is the matter with the<br />\nFreshmen?\" is heard on all sides. Well, what<br />\nis the matter with the Freshmen? They have<br />\nsome very good material in their class, which<br />\ncould be developed if the men worked. Freshmen, you simply must come out and work, if<br />\nyou have the interest of the 'Varsity at heart.<br />\nManager Wylie announces two track events<br />\nof great interest, which will be held sometime<br />\nduring February. The first of these is a track<br />\nand field meet between the Seniors and Juinors. Last year the present Juniors defeated<br />\nthe Seniors by a scant margin. Judging from<br />\nthis the meet will be a close one. The second<br />\nevent is an open cross-country run to be held<br />\nat Homewood. The prizes for this event will<br />\nprobably be a cup for the winner and medals<br />\nfor second and third places.<br />\nOur men expect to make a good showing at<br />\nthe George Washington University meet,<br />\nwhich will be held in Washington this Saturday. Our relay team is in good condition and<br />\nif all goes well we should win the 2-mile relay<br />\nwith George Washington University and the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia. Those who are entered<br />\nin the events are as follows:<br />\n50-yard Dash (novice)\u2014Wallace, Schneeberger and Wylie.<br />\n50-yard Dash (open handicap) \u2014Bailey,<br />\nStollenwerck, Burgan and Wallace.<br />\n440-yard Run (open handicap)\u2014Bailey and<br />\nStollenwerck.<br />\n<br />\n600-yard Run (open novice)\u2014Schneeberger<br />\nand Wallace.<br />\nMile Run\u2014Breyer and Griffith.<br />\nPole Vault\u2014Bridgeman.<br />\nHigh Jump\u2014Schneeberger and Burgan.<br />\n2-mile Relay\u2014Breyer, Brenton, Burgan,<br />\nTredway, Griffith, Stewart and Wallace.<br />\n<br />\nJUNIORS, 49\u2014FRESHMEN, 23.<br />\nThe second annual meet of the Juniors and<br />\nFreshmen track teams was held last Saturday<br />\nwith great success. There was a fine crowd,<br />\nin fact every inch of available space in the<br />\ncage was occupied. Most of the events were<br />\nclosely contested, but. it was unfortunate that<br />\nthe Freshmen did not show better organization, and have more men out for the events.<br />\nCaptain Bailey, of the Junior team organized<br />\nhis men in a highly efficient manner, and it<br />\nwas largely due to his efforts that the Juniors<br />\nwon by such a great margin.<br />\nTwo surprises were sprung, in the excellent<br />\nwork of Walters, '09 and Burgan, '11. The<br />\nformer, who entered the University this<br />\nyear, having been a student at Yale last year,<br />\nsucceeded in dJeating Michael, who has<br />\nrepresented the 'Varsity in the shot-put the<br />\nlast two seasons. The second surprise was<br />\nthe fine work of Burgan. He won the high<br />\njump handily, and showed excellent form in<br />\nthe half mile run, which he won easily. If<br />\nthese two men keep up their good work, they<br />\nwill undoubtedly be valuable additions to the<br />\ntrack team.<br />\nOne of the prettiest races was the 30-yard<br />\ndash, in which Stollenwerck was defeated by<br />\nBailey. Coach West was pleased by the work<br />\ndone by most of the men, and he said that if<br />\nonly the fellows, especially the Freshmen,<br />\nwould come out for the practices, there would<br />\nbe no doubt as to the success of the track<br />\nteam this year.

W. Ward and A. R<br />\nWaller. Vol. I. From the Beginnings to the<br />\nCycles of Romance.<br />\nTo the general reader this initial volume is<br />\ninteresting, perhaps, more for what it promises<br />\nin subsequent volumes than for what it actually contains. But for many of us, even if we<br />\nare not versed in Anglo-Saxon and Middle<br />\nEnglish, there is much that is most interesting in the period which is treated of in this<br />\nvolume. First in interest is the whole cycle<br />\nof Arthurian Romance and all the lesser and<br />\noriginally independent legends which graduually became incorporated with the stories of<br />\nArthur. This body of legends has exerted<br />\nmore influence on our literature than any<br />\nother one source of influence. Chaucer,<br />\nSpencer, Milton, Tennyson, Swinburne, all<br />\nhave been fascinated by the charm of the<br />\nstories. The chapters on \"The Arthurian<br />\nLegend,\" on \"Metrical Romances,\" and on<br />\n\"Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight\" are<br />\nthe most interesting. Chapter XIX,\"Changes<br />\nin the Language to the Days of Chaucer,\" is<br />\ninstructive and clearly and:concisely expressed.<br />\nIt is a pity that (p. 440) there are two misprints of old English alphabetical characters\u2014<br />\nwhich, as the types are beyond the resources<br />\nof our printers, we can only call attention to.<br />\nIt has become commonplace to remark that<br />\nthis first volume is a history of English Literature before England had any literature.

Of course a certain unity of<br />\ntreatment is .lost thereby and occasionally<br />\nstatements are needlessly repeated by the<br />\nwriters of different chapters.

Nothing better can be expected<br />\nof them. More ought rightly to be expected of us.

It<br />\nis interesting to note that in no nation have<br />\nthe people generally, ever looked upon smuggling as a question of right or wrong. \"The<br />\nsmuggler was always regarded as a benefactor,<br />\nbecause the people believed that he supplied<br />\nbetter articles at a cheaper rate, than those<br />\non which excise duties were paid. A writer<br />\nwho was rather partial to smugglers has said,<br />\nspeaking of the time when this practice was at<br />\nits highest point, \"To pretend to have any<br />\nscruple about buying smuggled goods would<br />\nbe regarded as a pedantic piece of hypocrisy.\"<br />\nThe smuggler himself was often a popular<br />\nfavorite, and there have been many romantic<br />\nstories connected with smugglers and their<br />\ntrade.<br />\nIn England smuggling appeared for the first<br />\ntime, during the thirteenth century, when<br />\ncounterfeit money began to be introduced<br />\nfrom abroad. This offence was declared a<br />\ntreason, and legislation on the subject was<br />\nactive for many years. Smuggling of wine,<br />\nspirits, tobacco, and money was practiced continually all around the coast. The Isle of<br />\nMan became the centre of so extensive a<br />\nsmuggling trade that the island was finally<br />\npurchased by the British Government at<br />\nenormous expense.<br />\nEnglish goods were often sent into France<br />\nthrough Belgium. Dogs were trained to carry<br />\nvaluable packages across the border; it is said<br />\nthat one dog could easily carry merchandise<br />\nworth one hundred and fifty dollars. The<br />\nFrench Government put an end to this method<br />\nof smuggling, by offering a reward of three<br />\nfrancs for every dog seized.<br />\nMost of the smuggling trade in England<br />\nand Scotland was done along the coast.<br />\nRevenue officers constantly patrolled the<br />\nshores, yet were often deceived by the keener<br />\nwits of the more experienced fishermen. In<br />\none sea-port of England, on a rocky coast,<br />\nwhere there were was only one harbor into<br />\nwhich a ship might be run at night, land her<br />\ncargo and hurry away before the officers knew<br />\nof her approach, there is a story, that a scheme<br />\nwas once cunningly planned by the smugglers<br />\nto kill many of their enemies, the Revenue<br /><br />\nofficers, and at the same time land their cargo<br />\nin safety. The report was spread so as to<br />\ncome to the officers' ears, that a cargo was to<br />\nbe landed in \"The Cove\" on a certain night.<br />\nThe Revenue officers concealed a party of men<br />\nnear the inlet, and then put out to sea in their<br />\nvessel, determined to seize the smugglers'<br />\nship in the act of running a cargo.<br />\nThe approach to the harbor was by a narrow channel; and, if a cargo was to be landed<br />\non a dark night, the smugglers' friends on<br />\nshore lighted beacons on either side of the<br />\nsmall bay, to act as guides for the vessel about<br />\nto \"run the cargo.\" This the officers on<br />\nboard the Revenue cutter knew and, having<br />\ncaught sight of the lights on the smugglers'<br />\nship, gave chase. The smuggler easily held<br />\nher own, and when nearing the rocky coast,<br />\nwhere the beacons were plainly visible, suddenly extinguished her lights. The Revenue<br />\nofficers, supposing that the smuggler was<br />\nmaking for the harbor, followed in quick pursuit, using the beacons on either side of the<br />\nchannel, as their guide. Suddenly the crew<br />\nheard the roar of breakers, and made every<br />\neffort to regain the open sea. It was useless,<br />\nhowever, and the vessel was wrecked, the<br />\nwhole of the crew being drowned, excepting<br />\nonly two or three men. It was afterwards<br />\nlearned that the smugglers, knowing that the<br />\nbeacons had been falsely placed on a high<br />\ncliff, and not on either side of the bay, had<br />\nturned sharply to one side when they extinguished their lights, and had avoided the<br />\ndestruction to which they knew the Government vessel was doomed. Afterwards the<br />\nparty of officers on shore was driven away by<br />\nthe smugglers, the cargo being safely landed<br />\nlater on in the night.<br />\nThe fishermen engaged in this perilous<br />\ntrade were usually of the roughest sort, and it<br />\nis said that, if a vessel was wrecked, these<br />\npeople would often refuse to give any aid to<br />\nthe sufferers, considering the shipwreck as a<br />\npiece of good 'fortune, and the vessel and its<br />\ncargo as their lawful prize.<br />\nIn Scotland the officials whose duty it was<br />\nto collect the inland taxes on home products,<br />\nwere called \"excisemen\" and they were also<br />\nsupposed to prevent the smuggling of contraband goods into the country. Robert Burns<br />\nwas at one time an \"excisemen\" and proved<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nhimself an excellent officer. On one occasion<br />\nhe placed himself at the head of a troop of<br />\ndragoons, crossed the Solway, was the first to<br />\nboard a smuggling brig, captured it, and had<br />\nthe vessel sold at Dumfries.<br />\nIn India opium has been smuggled far more<br />\nthan any other article. In this case, the<br />\nsmugglers do not attempt to introduce the<br />\nopium by importing it from other countries,<br />\nbut raise it in the inland districts, and try to<br />\nsmuggle it into the large towns, where, if<br />\nsuccessful, they may obtain very high prices.<br />\nNo one is allowed to raise opium without a<br />\ncostly permit from the Government, and there<br />\nare so many Government inspectors continually<br />\non the watch for this trade that smugglers<br />\n,find it difficult to obtain the opium. It seems<br />\nthat opium has a very peculiar smell which is<br />\neasily detected by any one familiar with it.<br />\nFarmers have been discovered on railway<br />\ntrains carrying bags apparently full of onions,<br />\nbut even the odor of the onions was not strong<br />\nenough to draw entirely the opium concealed<br />\nin the centre of the bags.<br />\nA case of smuggling opium abroad from the<br />\nUnited States was discovered in a somewhat<br />\nunusual way. A milkman who carried the<br />\nmilk on board of out-going steamers was frequently noticed talking to a convicted smuggler. This aroused the suspicions of a<br />\nGovernment inspector, who carelessly jolted<br />\nthe milkman as he was carrying a can on board<br />\nof a vessel about to sail, knocking the can to<br />\nthe pavement. The inspector learned from<br />\nthe sound that the can was not hollow, but<br />\nsolid. He immediately cabled to the ship's<br />\ndestination, and the inspectors there discovered<br />\nthat many of the niilk-cans were filled with<br />\nopium.<br />\n- At the present time the duty on most<br />\nimported articles has been lessened until smuggling is confined chiefly to tobacco, precious<br />\nstones, gloves and laces.<br />\nJewels are smuggled into this country in<br />\nseveral ways. It does not seem difficult to<br />\ncarry uncut diamonds in one's pockets, conceal them in the hair, or put them in the heel<br />\nof a shoe, but it is found that persons doing<br />\nthis cannot avoid giving suspicion and being<br />\ndetected.<br />\nLaces are sometimes smuggled by being<br />\nplaced in the false bottom of a trunk.

The panelling in officers' cabins has sometimes been<br />\nremoved, the space being filled with cigars,<br />\nbrandy, or rum. About twenty bales of<br />\nSumatra tobacco were recently discovered,<br />\nhidden under the coal in the bunkers of a<br />\nsteamship. If any of the officers or crew is<br />\ncaught in the act of smuggling, the articles<br />\nare not only confiscated, but a heavy fine is<br />\nalso imposed. If the crew of a vessel can be<br />\nbribed, however, packages may be lowered<br />\noverboard into a waiting launch, usually very<br />\nlong and painted black, so as not to be<br />\nnoticeable at night. On one occasion the<br />\nauthorities were notified that a large amount<br />\nof cigars was to be smuggled, and an extra<br />\nnumber of men was detailed to make sure that<br />\nthe attempt would not be successful.<br />\nA rubber bag containing five thousand<br />\ncigars was lowered overboard at night from<br />\na vessel in the harbor, caught by a row-boat,<br />\ntowed to the dock, and landed without attracting attention. The sailor who landed the<br />\ncigars was walking up the dock, carrying the<br />\nlarge bundle under his arm, when he was<br />\narrested by a city policeman as a suspicious<br />\ncharacter. The fraud was soon discovered by<br />\nthe city authorities and the Government inspectors who were still watching for the smugglers, were informed to their great chagrin,<br />\nthat the prey had already been captured.<br />\nA peculiar manner of smuggling diamonds<br />\nis said to have been used at one time, as follows. The Government was notified that a<br />\nparty consisting of a man, his wife, a baby,<br />\nand its nurse would attempt to import several<br />\nvery valuable uncut diamonds without paying<br />\nthe duty. The four were carefully watched<br />\nby detectives, but nothing suspicious could be<br />\nfound. Their baggage was inspected at the<br />\npier, and the persons themselves were very<br />\nclosely examined, but without success. Just<br />\nas they were turning to leave the pier, how-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\never, the baby dropped its rattle to the floor.<br />\nThe father's eye lighted upon it, and he<br />\neagerly sprang after the toy, but did not reach<br />\nit until the rattle had been smashed to pieces<br />\non the dock, a handful of diamonds rolling<br />\nout on the pavement. This ingenious method<br />\nof smuggling may often have been used before<br />\nsuccessful, and shows what clever schemes<br />\nsmugglers have learned to adopt.<br />\nSmuggling, however, is rapidly becoming<br />\nless frequent and, while there will probably be<br />\nsome smuggling as long as duties are imposed,<br />\nthe revenue which is lost in this way has<br />\ndecreased until, at the present time, the loss<br />\nis not great enough to be of any serious<br />\nimportance.<br /><br />\nA REPLY.<br />\nJANUARY 20, 1908.<br />\nEditor-in-Toto, Nliws-LETTER :<br /><br />\nDEAR SIR :\u2014Enclosed you will find a burning<br />\nanswer to your tragedy entitled \"Howard Street.\"<br />\nWith best wishes for other night-mares,<br />\nYours,<br /><br />\nMr. Editor:\u2014As you observed in a<br />\nformer issue about a drunken man of<br />\nInquisitive mind,<br />\nI wish to remark that this man desired to seek whatever information<br />\nHe could find,<br />\nAnd, having concentrated binocular<br />\nvision on your face,<br />\nThen inquired<br /><br />\nA BALLAD OF LOVE AND DUTY.<br />\nThe Knight rode out, all armed for war,<br />\nHis helm and his shield were shining bright,<br />\nA blade of proven steel he bore,<br />\nAnd his eyes were aflame with the battlelight.<br />\n\"The Dragon's claws are sharp and strong,<br />\nAnd life is sweet and death is long,<br />\nBut I lift my voice in a battle-song<br />\nAnd I set my face to the fight.\"<br />\nHis Lady hid her bitter fears,<br />\n(For she saw the warrior's heart was<br />\nlight);<br />\nShe smiled amid her gentle tears<br />\nAs she prayed God speed her parting<br />\nKnight.<br />\n(\"But what if the prayer is vain I pray;<br />\nIf death shall take the field today?)<br />\nThy duty calls thee to the fray,<br />\nGo forth, dear Love, and fight.\"<br /><br />\nThe Knight rode back with the Dragon's<br />\nhead,<br />\n(His lance and his helm no longer bright).<br />\n\"I feared, I feared,\" the Lady said,<br />\n\"But love must yield and I sent my<br />\nKnight<br />\nWhen duty's call to battle rang,<br />\nAnd none but I could know the pang,<br />\nFor I feared the death of the Dragon's fang;<br />\nBut I sent him forth to fight.\"<br />\noft<br /><br />\nAbout the hxmatococci sphcerellx<br />\npluvialis which, it seems,<br />\nMade you tired.<br />\nIndulgent you should then have been lb<br />\nwhen he sought to learn<br />\nAbout the little calf,<br />\nFor, don't you know, when he referred to the \"cow-and-one-half,\" he<br />\nmeant<br />\nThe cow and its better-half.<br /><br />\n\"The foe is slain!\" his vassals cried,<br />\n\"The world hath known no bolder<br />\nKnight.\"<br />\nHe turned him to his Lady's side,<br />\nAnd his eyes with love were wondrous<br />\nbright;<br />\n\"The Beast was fierce and dread to see,<br />\nMy heart misgave me fearsomely;<br />\nBut this thy word hath strengthened me:<br />\n'Go forth, dear Love, and fight.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nJ.

He graduated from<br />\nColumbia in 1883, and after several years of<br />\ngraduate study, spent two years in Germany.<br />\nOn his return, he was appointed an associate<br />\nin English literature which position he occupied<br />\nuntil 1895, when he accepted the chair of<br />\nJudo-Iranian languages. This position he<br />\nholds today. He has travelled in India,<br />\nPersia, and Central Asia, mainly for the purposes of research. He has published several<br />\nvolumes relating to Persia, and other subjects<br />\nin his special line of research, and has contributed largely to various learned periodicals.<br />\nDuring the course of his career he has done a<br />\ngood deal of public lecturing and was, we<br />\nbelieve, invited to give the Turnbull Lecturers<br />\nseveral winters ago, but at that time found it<br />\nimpossible to do so.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE ALUMNUS' STORY.<br />\n\"Yes,\" said the returned Alumnus, as we<br />\nseated ourselves in a retired corner of the<br />\nlibrary, \"this is how it all happened. One<br />\nmorning in October in my first post-graduate<br />\nyear they found the photograph of the last<br />\nyear's senior class\u2014my class\u2014broken from its<br />\nframe, torn up, and strewn over the floor<br />\naround the place where it had been hanging,<br />\nin McCoy Hall, second floor, right there by<br />\nthe Dean's room, you know. I had left for<br />\nEurope three days after the photograph had<br />\nbeen taken in June, and had consequently not<br />\nseen the picture until the Fall.<br />\n\"Well, they talked about the destruction of<br />\nthe photograph for a week or two, but no one<br />\never arrived at any conclusion because there<br />\nwas only one man who knew how the picture<br />\nhad been damaged, and that was myself.<br />\n'Since my earliest days I had had an almost<br />\nuncontrollable dislike of being on the left side<br />\nof a group'of people. At home my place had<br />\nalways been at the right side of the diningtable; and in my football days I always insisted upon playing in the right side of the<br />\nline. It is impossible to describe to you the<br />\ncurious feeling of dread that used to possess<br />\nme whenever I found myself misplaced in a<br />\ngroup; I might compare it to homesickness in<br />\nits worst form\u2014a feeling that one must do<br />\nsomething or die. As I look back upon it I<br />\ncannot think it simply childish, for as the rest<br />\nof my story will show, it contained very<br />\nserious possibilities.<br />\n\"When the photograph was taken I placed<br />\nmyself in the right side of the group and<br />\nthought no more about it. But when in October I saw the print for the first time, I perceived that as the photograph was taken from<br />\nthe front of the group I was represented on<br />\nthe left side of Ike picture! Then I realized<br />\nfor the first time the strange fact that this<br />\nmental antipathy extended not only to my<br />\nphysical being but even to the pictorial representation of myself. I struggled with all my<br />\nwill-power against the nervous terror that<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nbegan to come over me, but in vain. It increased hourly until from a mere incidental<br />\nidea it became a dominant force, and until- in<br />\na few days I was suffering more acutely than<br />\nany physical pain could cause.<br />\n\"Perhaps you have observed that curious<br />\nstate between waking and dreaming when the<br />\nimagination runs riot and the brain, while<br />\nperfectly conscious, cannot c on trol the<br />\nthoughts. Under the influence of such a<br />\nstate I have at times imagined myself dizzily<br />\nspinning around, top-fashion, and although<br />\nquite aware that it was only fancy I have been<br />\nquite unable to compel the imagination to<br />\ncease its working. Such a state lasts only a<br />\nfew minutes, till sleep or perfect consciousness puts an end to it; at the time of which I<br />\nam telling you I was in a similar condition,<br />\nwhich lasted for days. I could not overcome<br />\nwhat I knew to be only a delusion, an interesting case for the psychopathologist. I attended<br />\nmy classes, and performed my daily duties<br />\nregularly, but the things of reality were but a<br />\ndream, while the dream had all the aspects of<br />\nreality.<br />\n\"One day about six o'clock, as I came down<br />\nthe corridor from the Seminary, where I had<br />\nbeen doing some late work, my eyes fell upon<br />\nthe picture. The wild feeling of mental and<br />\nphysical distortion came over me with<br />\nredoubled force. How can I make it clear to<br />\nyou? It seemed as if I should have been by<br />\nall rule and right in the other side of the<br />\ngroup; that a force greater than myself had<br />\ndragged me away from my place, straining<br />\nevery nerve and fibre in my body. I imagine<br />\nthat my thoughts were like the thoughts of a<br />\nman who awakes from a trance and realizes<br />\nin one brief instant of mental clearness that<br />\nthey have nailed the coffin-lid down and cast<br />\nthe clods upon him.<br />\n\"And there was the frame, directly within<br />\nmy reach\u2014<br />\n`With the rattle of broken glass I came to<br />\nmy senses. I left the hall in a state of considerable excitement, and have never had a<br />\nreturn of this astonishing malady.\u2014I'm<br />\nawfully obliged to you, for taking me over<br />\nthe old place again; it certainly has changed<br />\nsince I first cribbed my Horace and mixed<br />\npoison in the chemical lab. So long.\"<br />\nI wonder if it all did happen?<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE TRACK TEAM.<br />\nThe track season is well under way now,<br />\nand judging from the work of the men who<br />\nare out for the team, the present season should<br />\nbe a most successful one. Our distance men,<br />\nBreyer and Brenton, have already scored a<br />\ntriumph for Hopkins, when they won first and<br />\nsecond places in the open cross-country run<br />\nheld by Georgetown, on January 1. This<br />\nvictory of our distance runners was a notable<br />\none, for they were in competition with some<br />\nof the best distance men in the East; in fact<br />\nit was a Yale man who won third place.<br />\nThere is one thing noticed among the candidates for the track team, and that is the<br />\nsmall number of Freshmen who are coming<br />\nout for practice. Often there are one or two,<br />\nand on rare occasions three or four Freshmen<br />\npracticing in the cage on track afternoons.<br />\nThe question, \"What is the matter with the<br />\nFreshmen?\" is heard on all sides. Well, what<br />\nis the matter with the Freshmen? They have<br />\nsome very good material in their class, which<br />\ncould be developed if the men worked. Freshmen, you simply must come out and work, if<br />\nyou have the interest of the 'Varsity at heart.<br />\nManager Wylie announces two track events<br />\nof great interest, which will be held sometime<br />\nduring February. The first of these is a track<br />\nand field meet between the Seniors and Juinors. Last year the present Juniors defeated<br />\nthe Seniors by a scant margin. Judging from<br />\nthis the meet will be a close one. The second<br />\nevent is an open cross-country run to be held<br />\nat Homewood. The prizes for this event will<br />\nprobably be a cup for the winner and medals<br />\nfor second and third places.<br />\nOur men expect to make a good showing at<br />\nthe George Washington University meet,<br />\nwhich will be held in Washington this Saturday. Our relay team is in good condition and<br />\nif all goes well we should win the 2-mile relay<br />\nwith George Washington University and the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia. Those who are entered<br />\nin the events are as follows:<br />\n50-yard Dash (novice)\u2014Wallace, Schneeberger and Wylie.<br />\n50-yard Dash (open handicap) \u2014Bailey,<br />\nStollenwerck, Burgan and Wallace.<br />\n440-yard Run (open handicap)\u2014Bailey and<br />\nStollenwerck.<br /><br />\n600-yard Run (open novice)\u2014Schneeberger<br />\nand Wallace.<br />\nMile Run\u2014Breyer and Griffith.<br />\nPole Vault\u2014Bridgeman.<br />\nHigh Jump\u2014Schneeberger and Burgan.<br />\n2-mile Relay\u2014Breyer, Brenton, Burgan,<br />\nTredway, Griffith, Stewart and Wallace.<br /><br />\nJUNIORS, 49\u2014FRESHMEN, 23.<br />\nThe second annual meet of the Juniors and<br />\nFreshmen track teams was held last Saturday<br />\nwith great success. There was a fine crowd,<br />\nin fact every inch of available space in the<br />\ncage was occupied. Most of the events were<br />\nclosely contested, but. it was unfortunate that<br />\nthe Freshmen did not show better organization, and have more men out for the events.<br />\nCaptain Bailey, of the Junior team organized<br />\nhis men in a highly efficient manner, and it<br />\nwas largely due to his efforts that the Juniors<br />\nwon by such a great margin.<br />\nTwo surprises were sprung, in the excellent<br />\nwork of Walters, '09 and Burgan, '11. The<br />\nformer, who entered the University this<br />\nyear, having been a student at Yale last year,<br />\nsucceeded in dJeating Michael, who has<br />\nrepresented the 'Varsity in the shot-put the<br />\nlast two seasons. The second surprise was<br />\nthe fine work of Burgan. He won the high<br />\njump handily, and showed excellent form in<br />\nthe half mile run, which he won easily. If<br />\nthese two men keep up their good work, they<br />\nwill undoubtedly be valuable additions to the<br />\ntrack team.<br />\nOne of the prettiest races was the 30-yard<br />\ndash, in which Stollenwerck was defeated by<br />\nBailey. Coach West was pleased by the work<br />\ndone by most of the men, and he said that if<br />\nonly the fellows, especially the Freshmen,<br />\nwould come out for the practices, there would<br />\nbe no doubt as to the success of the track<br />\nteam this year.

W. Ward and A. R<br />\nWaller. Vol. I. From the Beginnings to the<br />\nCycles of Romance.<br />\nTo the general reader this initial volume is<br />\ninteresting, perhaps, more for what it promises<br />\nin subsequent volumes than for what it actually contains. But for many of us, even if we<br />\nare not versed in Anglo-Saxon and Middle<br />\nEnglish, there is much that is most interesting in the period which is treated of in this<br />\nvolume. First in interest is the whole cycle<br />\nof Arthurian Romance and all the lesser and<br />\noriginally independent legends which graduually became incorporated with the stories of<br />\nArthur. This body of legends has exerted<br />\nmore influence on our literature than any<br />\nother one source of influence. Chaucer,<br />\nSpencer, Milton, Tennyson, Swinburne, all<br />\nhave been fascinated by the charm of the<br />\nstories. The chapters on \"The Arthurian<br />\nLegend,\" on \"Metrical Romances,\" and on<br />\n\"Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight\" are<br />\nthe most interesting. Chapter XIX,\"Changes<br />\nin the Language to the Days of Chaucer,\" is<br />\ninstructive and clearly and:concisely expressed.<br />\nIt is a pity that (p. 440) there are two misprints of old English alphabetical characters\u2014<br />\nwhich, as the types are beyond the resources<br />\nof our printers, we can only call attention to.<br />\nIt has become commonplace to remark that<br />\nthis first volume is a history of English Literature before England had any literature.
