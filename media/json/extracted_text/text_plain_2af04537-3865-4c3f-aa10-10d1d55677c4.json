Towson had had five<br />\nWeeks practice, Hopkins only<br />\nthree. \"We just weren't sharp<br /><br />\nyet,\" explains Cochrane.<br />\nWhile lack of experience may<br />\nhave been the underlying reason<br />\nfor Towson's first victory over<br />\nthe Jays in six years, a more direct cause may be seen in the<br />\nstatistics of the game. While<br />\nHopkins was taking 10 shots at<br />\nthe goal, Towson took 21.

Four freshman have<br />\nbeat out upperclassmen for first<br />\nstring berths, the most promising of these being Danny Murphy. Small (5'9-, 155 lbs.) for<br />\neven college football, Murphy<br />\nforced big Steve Dallolio (6'1\",<br />\n205 lbs.), last year's first string<br />\nquarterback, to take over the<br />\nfullbacking duties.<br />\nFour Freshmen<br />\nKeith Tunnel( and Bryan<br />\nKurtz have both taken over the<br />\nend posts, while Mark Slotkin,<br />\nthe fourth freshman, holds down<br />\nthe center position.

The Bears had<br />\nnot beaten Hopkins since the<br />\nseries between the two teams began in 1958. They came on<br />\nstrong though, to beat the Jays<br />\nin a game marked by injuries<br />\nand penalties.<br /><br />\nUrsinus scored one TD by recovering a Hopkins fumble in<br />\nthe end zone; another was set<br />\nup by a fumble recovery on the<br />\nJay 33-yard line.
