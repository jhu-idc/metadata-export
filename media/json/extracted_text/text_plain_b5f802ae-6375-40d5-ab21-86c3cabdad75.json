Fishbein felt it was too<br />\nall -encompassing, leaving the<br />\nUniversity open to possible<br />\nlawsuits. The term \"due<br />\nprocess,\" in particular, was<br />\nconsidered likely to cause a legal<br />\ntangle. Senior Class President<br />\nMonroe Zeffert questioned the<br />\nwording of the sixth clause of<br />\nthe Article, which provides for<br />\nprotection from double jeopardy.<br />\nIt was then suggested by Council<br />\n<br />\nVice-President Bruce Smith that<br />\nthe terms \"fair trial\" and \"due<br />\nprocess\" need to be defined.\"We<br />\ndon't want to make it too<br />\nlegalistic,\" responded Simon.<br />\nRobert Elkin, Junior Class<br />\nRepresentative, proposed that<br />\nthe word \"trial\" be changed to<br />\n\"hearing.\"<br />\nDiscussion then shifted to the<br />\nright of an accused student to<br />\nrepresentation. Simon pointed<br />\niout that this right \"should be<br />\nincluded in all cases,\" but there<br />\nwas disagreement on the exact<br />\nform the representation should<br />\ntake. Fishbein had suggested that<br />\n\"counsel\" should be someone<br />\nfrom within the University<br />\ncommunity. Sophomore Class<br />\nPresident Coos Hamburger<br />\nsupported this viewpoint by<br />\narguing that \"not all students can<br />\nafford a lawyer.\" Most Council<br />\nmembers agreed that should a<br />\nstudent hire a lawyer to defend<br />\nhim, the prosecution (i.e. the<br />\nUniversity), would be forced to<br />\nhire professional counsel, both to<br />\nmake the hearing fair and in<br />\norder to have any chance of<br />\nwinning the case.<br />\nThe Council postponed<br />\nmaking any decision until next<br />\nweek. Simon asked members to<br />\nsuggest revisions to the draft in<br />\nthe meantime.<br />\n<br />\nretain 10 additional custodial<br />\nwo:kers because of increase in<br />\nmaintenance required by the<br />\nopening of Mudd Hall.<br />\nMeasuring efficiency in terms<br />\nof completed work schedules,<br />\nCampbell stated that the present<br />\nstaff is more efficient than before<br />\nthe change, because by working<br />\nat night custodians have ready<br />\naccess to more rooms<br />\nGRO Representative Carlton<br />\nHaywood, present at the Zdanis<br />\nmeeting, reported that the<br />\nAssociate Provost admitted his<br />\ninability to demonstrate any<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting Wednesday with<br />\na group of concerned students<br />\nbacked by several student<br />\norganizations, Associate Provost<br />\nand Vice President for<br />\nAdminislrative Services Richard<br />\nA. Zdanis agreed to reconsider<br />\nhis decision, implemented July<br />\n10th, shifting 22 day custodial<br />\nworkers to permanent night<br />\nshifts. Zdanis will announce his<br />\nnew decision next Tuesday,<br />\nNovember 21st.<br />\nThe students presented Zdanis<br />\na letter signed by the Black<br />\nStudent Union, the Jewish<br />\nStudent Association, the Young<br />\nDemocrats, the College<br />\nRepublicans, and the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization.<br />\nBY DAN WILE<br />\nLast night, the Student<br />\nCouncil voted to support the<br />\nRobert Fink, Student Council<br />\nletter, already presented to<br />\nand Chairman of the<br />\nTreasurer<br />\npreviously<br />\nCouncil<br />\nThe<br />\nZdanis.<br />\nmet with William Campbell to Student Activities Commission,<br />\nhear his version of the situation. proposed a reorganization of<br />\nAccording to Campbell, the SAC's powers in order to meet<br />\nobject of the controversial absolute or inflation induced<br />\nchange was to respond to budget cuts at the Student<br />\nsubstantial budget cuts while Council meeting last night.<br />\nHe said the present SAC<br />\nmaintaining efficient custodial<br />\nthough adequate<br />\nconstitution,<br />\nhas<br />\nhe<br />\nthat<br />\nclaims<br />\nservice.

The war was deeply<br />\nwrong, costly, and superficial , he<br />\n<br />\nsaid. Even as the Students for a<br />\n'Democratic Society was<br />\nsuccessful in most of its<br />\nattempts, so were other<br />\nmovements which tried to bring<br />\nabout social equality and reform.<br />\nThe Students for a.<br />\nDemocratic Society (SDS) did<br />\nnot have an easy start, at first. As<br />\nHayden said, the students were<br />\ntold that a youth movement<br />\ncould not develop in an affluent<br />\ncountry such as the United<br />\nStates. This negative attitude had<br />\nla devastating impact on them.<br />\nThe students had to fight against<br />\nthe system, which wouldn't let<br />\nthem even vote.<br />\nHayden said he did not feel<br />\nany satisfaction at the<br />\nachievements he was able to<br />\nbring about with his colleagues.<br />\nSome conditions have<br />\ndeteriorated - for instance, there<br />\nare officially more poor people<br />\nnow, the spending of weapons<br />\nhas gone up, and there is a<br />\n<br />\nCotuvba<br />\nHold PIIAC<br />\nResolution<br />\nHearing<br />\nA public forum will be held<br />\nTuesday November 28th, from<br />\n6:30 to 9:00 p.m. in the Glass<br />\nPavilion by the Student Council's<br />\nInvestment Morality- Committee<br />\n(IMC) to consider six resolutions<br />\nsubmitted by stockholders to,<br />\ncompanies in which JHU owns<br />\nstock.

Smith recalled<br />\nthat students were the<br />\n\"conscience of .society\" in the<br />\n60's and he said it iS ielportant<br />\nthat they don't surrender that<br />\nrole.<br />\nThe resolutions were drafted<br />\nby minority stockholders and<br />\nsubmitted to the corporations for<br />\nballoting at the next stockholders<br />\nmeeting. Five of the resolutions<br />\nwere written by churches and<br />\none by an individual.<br />\nTwo resolutions are before the<br />\nContinental Illinois corporation,<br />\na major Chicago bank, one<br />\nrequesting that the bank provide<br />\nhelp for redeveloping existing<br />\nareas to the same degree aid is<br />\nalready being given to new<br />\ncommunities, the other<br />\nrequesting the disclosure of loans<br />\nand loan policy toward South<br />\nAfrica.<br />\nAnother resolution concerning<br />\nSouth Africa is being considered<br />\n'by Eastman Kodak, which would<br />\nend all sales between the two.<br />\nThe last resolution would require<br />\nthe disclosure to stockholders<br />\ncampaign contributions of over<br />\n1,000 dollars and all Federal<br />\ncontracts or arrangements<br />\ncurrently in force.<br />\n<br />\nChris Taylor of PHAC<br />\n<br />\ntremendous<br />\neconomic<br />\ninsecurity among the middle class.<br />\nThe SDS movements, however did<br />\nproduce some tangible results.<br />\nWalls of segregration have gone<br />\ndown and the Civil Rights<br />\nMovement picked up<br />\nmomentum. Hayden expressed<br />\ndissatisfaction at the racial<br />\nsituation in the country today.<br />\n\"Blacks and whites live apart in<br />\nfact (practice), together by law<br />\n(theory).\"<br />\nHayden concluded his speech<br />\nby expressing his conviction that<br />\nthe \"lunatics of the sixties will<br />\ncome into the mainstreams of the<br />\n'80's and '90's The new<br />\nconsciousness created by the<br />\nSixties was so huge ..that it would<br />\nnot be repressed.

Jenny Adams<br />\ninterviewed some 20 of the 45<br />\ncustodial workers currently on<br />\nthe night shift. Interviews were<br />\nlimited to fiftee:i minutes and,<br />\nthough requested to leave,<br />\nsupervisors remained.<br />\nThe student group has raised<br />\nquestions concerning the manner<br />\nin which the decision was<br />\nimplemented. Although the<br />\n\u2022 University conducted a man-hour<br />\nsurvey last year, comparing the<br />\nproductivity of employees from<br />\nthe three shifts, it declined an<br />\nopportunity to consult a<br />\ncost-benefit analysis efficiency<br />\nexpert. The administration<br />\nnotified employees and their<br />\nunion about the change one<br />\nmonth, 10 days before<br />\nimplementation, without<br />\nconsulting either group<br />\nbeforehand. On the basis of<br />\nseniority, supervisors offered first<br />\nand second shift employees their<br />\nchoice of positions on the three<br />\nshifts. According to Campbell,<br />\nthey went through 17 people<br />\nbefore filling the eight available<br />\nfirst and second shift positions.<br />\n<br />\nCustodial workers claimed the<br />\nquestion was put to them as a<br />\nchoice between changing to the<br />\nthird shift or \"taking a walk<br />\ndown Charles Street.\" Aside<br />\nfrom a $.15 per hour wage<br />\nincrease for those switching from<br />\nthe first to the third shift, no<br />\ncompensation was offered.<br />\nThe concerned students also<br />\nquestioned the propriety of the<br />\ndecision itself. Campbell stated<br />\nthat he had requested an<br />\nestimated $200,000 more for the<br />\nfiscal year than he received.<br />\n$100,000 was to have been made<br />\nup through the efficiency<br />\n'produced by the switch to the<br />\n,night shift, with the remaining<br />\n$100,000 compensated for in<br />\nseveral ways, such as through<br />\nmore efficient use of energy.<br />\nCampbell claimed he could not<br />\nconceive of any viable alternative<br />\nto the change to night shift,<br />\nexcept laying off employees and<br />\nthereby sacrificing efficiency or<br />\nresorting to cleaning on alternate<br />\ndays which would also decrease<br />\nthe amount of work custodians<br />\ncould effectively carry through.<br />\n\"We cannot maintain the level of<br />\ncustodial maintenance now at the<br />\nprese:It budget level if we return<br />\npersonnel to their old shifts,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nCustodial workers claimed the<br />\nmove was actually motivated by<br />\nthe desire of administrators to<br />\nbring in sub-contract workers<br />\nwho would work for lower wages<br />\nand would pose no labor<br />\nrelations problems. They said<br />\nthat five people have been fired<br />\n<br />\nsince the July 10th decision.<br />\nAccording to Adams, Head of<br />\nHousekeeping Vic Zanella stated<br />\nthat he expected an attrition rate<br />\nof 50% in response to the shift.<br />\nCampbell said this remark<br />\nrepresented a \"hunch\" on the<br />\npart of Zanella, not a hopeful<br />\nexpectation that workers would<br />\nquit. He noted that the attrition<br />\nrate was not \"terribly unusual\",<br />\nafter the change. Campbell added<br />\nthat although the University<br />\ncould save a substantial amount<br />\nof money by bringing in<br />\nsub-contract workers, it would<br />\nsuffer a serious loss of efficiency<br />\namong employees because they<br />\nwould have no \"vested interest\"<br />\nin the institution.<br />\nCampbell stated that 4<br />\n<br />\nworkers retired as of June 10th.<br />\nSince the decision was<br />\nimplemented, 4 other workers<br />\nhave left their jobs. Campbell<br />\nstated that two of these failed to<br />\nreport for work for three days<br />\nand did not 'call the University,<br />\nand that the other two `possibly'<br />\nquit.\" He added, \"No one has<br />\nbeen released from the University<br />\nas a result of the change.\"<br />\nAccording to the group of<br />\nstudents who spoke to the<br />\nStudent Council Wednesday<br />\nnight, Dr. Zdanis based his<br />\noriginal decision on a cost-benefit<br />\nanalysis, which would require<br />\nconcessions on the part of the<br />\nUniversity and of the custodians.<br />\nStudent Jerry Spada argued that<br />\nthi tradeoff was not fair; people<br />\n<br />\nwho could ill afford it were being<br />\nasked to bear the financial<br />\nburden. Many custodial workers<br />\nare blacks, women, and non-U.S.<br />\ncitizens, some without high<br />\nschool diplomas. If the option<br />\nbeing offered them is between<br />\nnight work and quitting, many<br />\nare in effect coerced to stay<br />\nbecause of the near-impossibility<br />\nof securing other employment.<br />\nThe student group noted that Dr.<br />\nMuller, Dr. Zdanis and Campbell<br />\nhave all expressed concern about<br />\nthe \"human interest\" sacrificed<br />\nin the interests of budget. These<br />\nstudents expressed concern that<br />\nthe human rights of workers<br />\nconstituted a more important<br />\nfactor than the need for budget<br />\ncuts.<br />\n<br />\nFink Proposes New S.C. Subgroup Status;<br />\nSuggests Duplication Equipment For SAC<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nsubmitted blueprint to the<br />\nExecutive Board. The Board<br />\nwould then decide if the group is<br />\nspending allocated funds<br />\nefficiently and make suggestions.<br />\nThe SAC must finally resolve<br />\nthe status of all such groups,<br />\nFink said. He feels that the<br />\nreason that the Student .Council<br />\nTreasurer is head of the SAC<br />\nBoard is because of the existence \u2022<br />\nof the subcommittees. Further,<br />\nthe Student Council should<br />\nformally define the SAC<br />\nExecutive Board as head of the<br />\nfinancial structure of all student<br />\n<br />\nactivities, he said.<br />\nAccording to Fink, too much<br />\nmoney is spent on duplications<br />\nfor publicity purposes. He<br />\nproposed establishing a<br />\ncontingency fund to purchase a<br />\nproduction system or to devise<br />\nan agreement to use News-Letter<br />\nfacilities under which the groups<br />\nwould only have to pay labor<br />\ncosts. The SAC would pay for all<br />\nmaterials used.<br />\nThe Executive Board will also<br />\nallocate seed money rather than<br />\nfull budgets to groups that could<br />\npotentially make a profit. The<br />\nfunds will allow the group to<br />\n<br />\nstart operating, but it will have to<br />\n<br />\nreturn the money or a percentage<br />\nonce it begins to show a profit.<br />\nAccording to Fink, the system<br />\nhas worked with the Spring Fair,<br />\nwhich used to have a yearly<br />\nallocation but which always was<br />\nin the red. Now the Fair makes a<br />\nprofit, which it returns to the<br />\nSAC.<br />\nThe SAC might also sponsor<br />\nsocial activities off campus. This<br />\nwould provide an alternative to<br />\nthe present system where student<br />\ngovernment holds parties or<br />\ndances in one of five places on<br />\ncampus.<br />\n<br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series Presents<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\nIiIiL1iti<br />\n1!<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Band<br />\nPRESENTS ITS ANNUAL<br />\n<br />\nAHD now roil son=<br />\n<br />\ncorinITELT Durum<br />\nFriday & Saturday<br />\nNovember 17 & 18<br />\n7, 9, & 11 pm<br />\n<br />\n\\.\\\u2022<br />\n44\u2018.*<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nAdmission: $1.00<br />\nSeniors:$.75<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS FREE<br />\n<br />\nLAWRENCE SPRINGER, DIRECTOR<br />\n<br />\nTo the Saturday 7 pm show<br />\n<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\nSATURDAY,NOVEMBER 18,1978<br />\n*Sorry, Through the Looking Glass was<br />\ncancelled due to problems of censorship.<br />\n<br />\nAdmission Free<br />\n<br />\n8:00 R M.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 8 / NOVEMBER ,17, 1978<br />\n<br />\nigummaisamommummummismumommommuosomm--1<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\ni<br />\ni<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n1<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n.1<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u201e4<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\ni<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nCITIZEN KANE<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\n\u2018le II<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\n*CLAUDE HUBBARD QUARTET<br />\n()A VERNON WOLST<br />\n*MICKEY FIELDS QUARTET<br />\nGREAT JUNK FOOD &BEER4<br />\n<br />\nDIRECTED BY ORSON WELLES<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nS4 general public<br />\nI D REQUIRED<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nWEEKEND WONDER FLIX<br />\nFriday November 24 7:30 \u2022 Saturday November 25 9:30<br />\nDOUBLE FEATURE WITH<br />\n<br />\nBELTWAY EXIT 27s<br />\n<br />\n$ 2 with student I D<br />\nPROPER DRESS<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\ntalking picture that seems as fresh now as the<br />\nPAULINE KAEL<br />\nday it opened.\"<br />\n\"The most sensational product of the U.S.<br />\nmovie industry.

Lewis Myers a lawyer<br />\nworking with the United League,<br />\nclaimed there is more racism in<br />\nMississippi and the South in 1978<br />\nthan in 1958. All the things you<br />\nread and hear in the Media about<br />\nthe new South are wrong.\"<br />\nThe events which triggered the<br />\ncurrent movement were the<br />\nmurders of two blacks by Tupelo<br />\npolice (who are all white) last<br />\nMarch, and many other alleged<br />\ncases of police brutality against<br />\nBlacks. The United League is<br />\ndemanding the dismissal of<br />\nflagrantly brutal policemen and<br />\n<br />\nother reforms in the \"racist<br />\nMississippi power structure.\"<br />\nDuring a march of 800 people<br />\nin Tupelo last Labor Day, 50<br />\nKlansmen with guns attempted<br />\nto intimidate the demonstrators.<br />\nUnited League members have<br />\noften been legally and physically<br />\nharrassed by Klansmen and<br />\npoliticians during campaigns<br />\nthere.<br />\nMyers emphasized that the<br />\nKlansmen in Tupelo are not just<br />\npoor backward whites. They<br />\ninclude the principal of Tupelo<br />\nPublic High School, prominent<br />\nbusinessmen and policemen , he<br />\nsaid. \"A Black goes.to court to a<br />\njudge in a black robe, \"he said<br />\n,\"who was .the night before<br />\ndecked out in a white robe.\" He<br />\nstressed that racial problems are<br />\nnot unique to Mississsippi.<br />\n\"South in this country is<br />\nanything south of the Canadian<br />\nborder.\" He noted that there has<br />\nbeen no \"massive outcry\" against<br />\na resurgence of KKK activity<br />\nthroughout the country.<br />\nAll the United League speakers<br />\nat the meeting said the United<br />\nLeague movement is not simply<br />\nin the interest of blacks, but also<br />\nseeks to help the poor and<br />\npowerless throughout the United<br />\nStates fight the political and<br />\neconomic elites\u2022of the country.<br />\nMr. McCann said that from<br />\npre-Civil War times to the present<br />\nSouthern power elites have used<br />\nblacks as scapegoats to appease<br />\npoor whites.

Already I can hear those<br />\nformaldehyded-breathed biologists preach that nostalgia is<br />\nsymptomatic of an organic weakness, an unnecessary<br />\nregression; nostalgia simply is not efficient. However, here<br />\non the steamy plains of central Jersey, unleashed from my<br />\nofficial academic and intellectual standing, I am giddy<br />\nwith the freedom that allows me the simple pleasure of a<br />\nsimple movie musical such as Grecs(' At college, of<br />\ncourse, I could never confess enjoyment of such fluff in<br />\nfear of the inevitable ridicule and retribution my<br />\nsomewhat snobbish and worthless colleagues would heap<br />\nupon my already overburdened soft shoulders. In short, I<br />\nam liberated.<br />\n<br />\nI may be mistaken, but I think New Jersey is part of<br />\nwhat every generation of collegiate malcontents calls<br />\n\"The Real World.\" Admittedly the mere mention of New<br />\nJersey elicits more groans than hosannas. Naysayers who<br />\nconfine their forays into the wilderness of Jersey to a<br />\nspeedy death-defying jaunt on the Turnpike often curse<br />\nthe state as \"The Scrotum of America.\" Such a hideous<br />\nappellation, I daresay, does have a hint of validity; like a<br />\nscrotum, that part of Jersey is smelly and aesthetically<br />\ndisgusting, yet it produces goods essential for the survival<br />\nof the species. Indeed, outside that narrow asphalt strip,<br />\nNew Jersey reveals, pardon the expression, its \"grab bag\"<br />\nnature. In the hinterlands you can still experience the<br />\nrustic fertility that gave birth to Jersey's dubious<br />\nnickname, \"The Garden State.\" Gently rolling hills,<br />\nspeckled with dairy cows, gradually give way to the<br />\ntremendous truck farms of the Piedmont plain, which<br />\nthen quietly dissolves into the magnificent de&oiation of<br />\nthe Pine Barrens. And then there are the cities with names<br />\nas ugly as their appearance\u2014Hackensack, Seacaucus,<br />\nBayonne, etc--innocent victims of a culture and economy<br />\nthat has left for the supposed utopia of greener suburban<br />\npastures. Deserted dirty streets wind their way through<br />\nthe inescapable maze of blue collar ghettos, the once gold<br />\npaved boulevards that beckoned those of the Old Country<br />\nwith dreams of riches and delirious freedom. Between<br />\nthe boondocks and the ghost cities is the ersatz paradise<br />\nof bourgeois blight: irregular rows of split-level tenements<br />\nstretching to the far horizons. The hip and hypocritical<br />\nvalues, the squandering of wealth, the rising rates of<br />\njuvenile delinquency, alcoholism and drug abuse are all<br />\nkey components of the middle class muddle, and<br />\nsomehow this manages to pass as \"the good life.\" If<br />\nanything derserves the laughable title of \"The Real<br />\nWorld,\" then it is surely all of this, the crucible of<br />\nmankind that is New Jersey.<br />\nMy own part of Jersey is a confusing fusion of these<br />\ndisparate and desparate elements. Equidistant between<br />\nNew York and Philedelphia, the dateline of this essay is<br />\nwithin an easy ten-minute drive of this sociological<br />\nsmorgasboard of cities, suburbs, farms, and the grand<br />\ncountry estates of Cyrus Vance and Jackie Onassis.<br />\nPersonally, I have had contact with the first three; the la\"st<br />\nare rich enough to buy their segregation from us common<br />\nfolk. Because of this diversity it is extremely difficult, if<br />\nnot impossible, to communicate the essence of the place.<br />\n<br />\nTake, for example, the case history of one Joe D'Angelo,<br />\nsecond generation shift worker at American Dyes in<br />\nBound Brook. In his wallet he carries his kids' college<br />\ntranscripts; and later he tells you how the V.F.W. Hall was<br />\nfestooned with twisted crepe paper for his daughter's<br />\nreception and the band played the type of music you can<br />\ndance close to, not that dumb long hair stuff you can't<br />\nunderstand; and how, after the honeymoon, she blushed<br />\nwhen she told him about the mirrored ceiling and the<br />\nheart-shaped bathtub in their Poconos honeymoon haven;<br />\nand how at that moment he knew that she would always<br />\nbe Daddy's Little Girl.<br />\nYes, the area is both tough and grossly sentimental.<br />\nNobody likes Springsteen because his songs are too close<br />\nto the truth for comfort;girls really do comb their hair in<br />\nrear view mirrors and boys really do try to look so hard.<br />\nThere is scarcely a country roadside that is not littered<br />\nwith the remnants of clandestine beer busts. Everyone is<br />\ncareful not to mention the prevalence of so-called \"shot<br />\nglass\" babies who were conceived in the haze of a<br />\nmidnight bout with the spirits in the night.<br />\nHomosexuality is a disease one contacts in any men's<br />\nroom in New York. Without a doubt, the social graces<br />\ntake a licking here. My formal (and only)introduction to<br />\nthe world of dance was a brief two-day sojourn from the<br />\nrigors of gym class in which the girls' phys-ed teacher,<br />\nWilma Kruetzer, barked the beat of a ridiculously clumsy<br />\nbox step as if we were doing squat thrusts. In fancy<br />\nrestaurants neighbors complain that there aren't enough<br />\njours in their soup d'jour. A neighbor proclaims that<br />\nMonte Carlo is nothing special, \"the Asbury Park of the<br />\nMediterranean.\" My great uncle was a member of the<br />\nlocal Ku Klux Klan; they used to meet down at the house<br />\non the corner, but because there<br />\nwas no one to<br />\npersecute (hell, it's 1978 and still no Jews live in town<br />\nand if a black should ever move in, well, that'll be the<br />\nday) so they disintegrated into a midnight riding social<br />\nclub that sought vengeance on assorted moral offenders,<br />\nadulterers and the like. So, by blood and breed I was born<br />\na cretin, just a simple country boy, and hopefully, after<br />\nsixteen years of rugged self-discipline and unfaltering<br />\nhomage and worship of all things intellectual, bad and<br />\nbeautiful, hopefully I have been able to raise myself from<br />\nthis quagmire of life's dimmer side. Only the future, I'm<br />\nafraid, will tell whether I've succeeded.<br />\nBy now the clever among you must be wondering why<br />\nI am back here if life in these parts is as terrible as it<br />\nseems. Well, I hate to use the talk show phrase, but I need<br />\nthe time to get my act together. The frantic pace of<br />\ncontemporary life, especially that initial onrush of reality<br />\njust after graduation, precludes the opportunity for a<br />\nreasonable period of personal introspection and<br />\nmeditation in which one can create a workable model of<br />\nThe Real World. Too many lives and talents have been<br />\nwasted by the gratuitous whimsies of late adolescent<br />\nimpatience. Already two of my friends have dropped out<br />\nof law school to become, respectively, a cab driver and a<br />\nmessenger in a brokerage house, and yet a third plans to<br />\ndrop out of a prestigious graduate program to become, of<br />\nall things, a tatoo artist. External circumstances have<br />\nalways forced recent graduates to blunder into hasty<br />\ndecisions that are, at best, little more than perilous<br />\ngambles. Yet not many of us realize that we can decide<br />\nnot to decide-- that is, to possess a certain magnitude of<br />\nself-awareness to allow the invirulent honesty to admit we<br />\ntruly do not know what to do. Indecision and restlessness<br />\nare nothing to be ashamed of; indeed, they are hallmarks<br />\nof the quanderous condition of modern man in a society<br />\nwhere the individual's power of self-determination is<br />\nsharply checked. For a person who has been safely<br />\nentombed in the prosaic order of educational institutions,<br />\nthe sudden emergence into the complex, seemingly<br />\nchaotic reality of the outside world can be a traumatic<br />\nevent to the umpteenth degree. The best advice (and,<br />\nincidentally, the justification for my present idolatry) is<br />\nto relax and take all the time you need to decide the<br />\nn'ature of your life after your undergraduate days. After<br />\nall, your decision very well may decide the course of the<br />\nrest of your life.<br />\nThe trick of this process lies in developing a precise<br />\ndetermination of The Real World. For some among us,<br />\nthose poor misguided souls contemplating a career in<br />\nacademics, the college campus is indeed The Real World.<br />\nAt onetime, I must admit, the peaceful pace of academics<br />\nwith its ample rewards for just plain thought beckoned<br />\nthis rather callow young man who looks good in tweed<br />\njackets with elbow patches. Back to the point,The Real<br />\nWorld is only that physical and metaphysical part of the<br />\nplanet we choose to deem as such. Of course this is not as<br />\nsimple as it sounds. It has, I imagine, something to do<br />\nwith seeing yourself in the third person, and placing that<br />\nthird person into its proper position in your self-styled<br />\nidea of reality. In other words, you must see yourself as<br />\nthat essential piece of jigsaw that completes the picture.<br />\nTwo examples will hopefully clarify the concept.<br />\nSteven S. could not remember a time when he did not<br />\nwant to become a lawyer. Like a religious fanatic, Steven<br />\nplotted his youth with the sole goal of achieving Nirvana:<br />\ni.e. a prestigious east coast law school. Every<br />\n<br />\nex<br />\nhe<br />\ntir<br />\nev<br />\n<br />\nGc<br />\n<br />\n\fextracurricular activity was evaluated in terms of whether<br />\nhe could snare an office or title to sweeten his record. At<br />\ntimes poor Steven would be seized by spurts of paranoia;<br />\neven a valiant effort at creating a relationship with a<br />\nGoucher siren ended in a bog of misunderstood intentions<br />\n<br />\nand doubt. He chewed his fingernails down to nubs in<br />\nearning his 4.0 from Hopkins, and happily, he was<br />\nadmitted into Georgetown where, my sources tell me, he's<br />\nas happy as a lark.<br />\nNot so happy, however, is my tatoo artist friend, Larry<br />\nH. Throughout his undergraduate days at Rutgers, Larry<br />\nwas known more for his cartoons and caricatures than his<br />\ndeep and abiding interest in Estonia. To most of his<br />\nfriends, Larry was an enigma, someone who preferred to<br />\nsit back in the corner and watch the world go by,<br />\npatiently waiting and not really caring if his pipe ever<br />\nmade its way back to him. He never burdened himself<br />\nupon others; quiet as a clam, his occasional outbursts of<br />\nvitrolic cynicism only belied his personal insecurity. When<br />\nfriends chipped in for a bottle of fine whiskey to<br />\ncelebrate his acceptance into grad school, Larry was<br />\nembarrassed by his lack- of enthusiasm over what<br />\neverybody else thought was a great achievement. After all,<br />\ngrad school and the prospect of an advanced degree<br />\noffered an assurance of stability that the art world, by its<br />\nnature, never has. So, reluctantly, he shuffled off to the<br />\nbig city and soon, depressed by the boredom, found<br />\nhimself taking long mournful walks. On one of these<br />\nwalks he happened to notice a window sign advertising a<br />\njob \u2022 that seemed interesting, and now he plans to quit<br />\nschool in December.His portfolio has been subsequently<br />\nincreased by part time work as a designer of tattoos and<br />\nt-shirts in a Times Square arcade.<br />\nSuch happy endings, I am told, happen all the time. An<br />\nanthropology professor at Hopkins used to reassure his<br />\nbeleagured students that no matter how poor or desperate<br />\nthe living conditions, man would somehow find the way<br />\nto \"muddle through.\" And it is with that same sense of<br />\nforlorn optimism that the recent graduate approaches the<br />\nchallenges of The Real World. But one can only succeed<br />\nby possessing an unflagging belief in what you want to do.<br />\nThe roadblocks Larry H. constructed to barricade himself<br />\nfrom what he was taught by a society obsessed with<br />\naffluence and which considers art as a non-profitable,<br />\nnon-marketable talent, have been torn down by a<br />\ntremendous and glorious act of self-realization. It's useless<br />\nhere to add the cliche that happiness and personal status<br />\ncannot be measured -in terms of tangible values. Instead, I<br />\noffer now, in fear of retribution from the more<br />\nintellectual reader, some A.E. Housman tripe on tile<br />\nsubject:<br />\nWhen I was one-and-twenty<br />\nI heard a wise man say,<br />\n\"Give crowns and pounds and guineas<br />\nBut not your heart away;<br />\nGive pearls away and rubies<br />\nBut keep your fancy free.\"<br />\nBut I was one-and-twenty,<br />\nNo use to talk to me.<br />\nWhen I was one-and-twentY<br />\nI heard him say again,<br />\n\"The heart out of the bosom<br />\nWas never given in vain;<br />\n'Tis paid with sighs a-plenty<br />\nAnd sold for endless rue.\"<br />\nAnd I am two-and-twenty,<br />\nAnd oh,'tis true,'tis true.<br />\n<br />\nThe price of rue on the open market being what it is, a<br />\nconstant state of self-pity is essentially worthless, both in<br />\nterms of putting vread on the table and achieving a<br />\nmodicum of self-esteem. And that is all that matters.<br />\nThe biggest psychological problem facing the recent<br />\ngraduate is the acceptance and adaptation to change.<br />\nCollege does a more than efficient job in insulating the<br />\nindividual from the proverbial winds of change. Time<br />\nexists at college only on the night before a paper is due.<br />\nOnce out of college, however, we realize somewhat slowly<br />\nthat it is not the structure of society which ahs changed<br />\nduring our four year internment, but rather its style and<br />\nsubstance. There was a time, not long ago, when I could<br />\nwalk the few streets of this village and name every family<br />\nthat lived in every house. Yet now, when I walk down to<br />\nthe post office to mail this essay, I will recognize only a<br />\nfew names, and even fewer faces. Shocked and dismayed,<br />\nI begin to wonder if the essence of the village has changed<br />\nsurreptiously during my absence. An explanation: because<br />\nwe are so amazed and bewildered by the changes in our<br />\nphysical and psychological selves, we cannot help but fail<br />\nto notice the changes in the world around us. By<br />\ndefinition, because we have changed, so has The Real<br />\nWorld. The solution, then, is to create a matrix ofinternal<br />\nand external changes upon which we can plot by<br />\ninterpolation our exact position and progress. To spout<br />\nanother cliche, only by knowing where we are, can we<br />\ndiscover where we are going. Still, this ignores what is<br />\nperhaps the most devastating non-sociological aftermath<br />\nof college. For those of us fidicuary unfortunates who<br />\nweren't able to revel in the homosexual romps and other<br />\nadvantages of New England boarding schools, college is<br />\nthe first period of lengthy separation from our parents. Of<br />\nall the elments in The Real World, our parents have<br />\nchanged the most. And whatever you may think of them,<br />\nwhether you love or loathe them, or simply see them as a<br />\nnuisance, you must painfully admit to yourself the<br />\nmorbid yet total and unrelentless truth that your parents<br />\n<br />\nare four years nearer to their deaths, that somehow the<br />\nroles have been reversed, and that finally, your parents<br />\nneed you more than you need them.<br />\nYou see -- I've breathed too much of this central Jersey<br />\nair that carries the germ of gross sentimentality. I am<br />\nreduced to quoting Charles Lamb:<br />\nGhost-like I paced round the haunts of my childhood,<br />\nEarth seemed a desert I was bound to traverse,<br />\nSeeking to find the old familiar faces.<br />\nUnfortunately, my present situation brings up yet another<br />\nproblem of coping with The Real World. What happens,<br />\nsay, after you've defined The Real Wrold to apparent<br />\nsatisfaction, and you duddenly discover you don't like<br />\nwaht you've created? A writer can destroy a manuscript;<br />\nHemingway reportedly threw the typescript of his first<br />\nnovel overboard on an Atlantic crossing. Doctors can bury<br />\ntheir mistakes. But we normal folk can not discard a<br />\nsegment of a life or right a wrong that has long since<br />\ndisappeared. The Real World here in New Jersey, sad to<br />\nsay, is quite disappointing. The job situation is woefully<br />\ninadequate; the pervading mental depression seems to<br />\nhave overlapped into the economy. The once pastoral<br />\nvistas of cut cornfields and snaking snow fence are now<br />\nspoiled by the insidious encroachment of suburban<br />\nbanality. The air is not as clear as it used to be, and every<br />\nnight another star fades into the ersatz glow of artificial<br />\nlight. The familiar faces of friends and family have<br />\ndistorted into grotesques, and there are no Mrs.<br />\nRobinsons to service the recent graduate. I bow to<br />\nThomas Wolfe, the man who raised nostalgia and romance<br />\nto a malignancy, who intended to use these words from<br />\n<br />\nWar and Peace on the title page of The Web and the<br />\nRock: \"Prince Andrei looked up at the stars and sighed;<br />\neverything was so different from what he thought it was<br />\ngoing to be.<br />\nSo, it is only with the lowered resistance of near sleep,<br />\nwhen I'm feeling lonely and beat, I drift back in time, and<br />\nI find my feet down on Charles Street.<br />\nALAS, JOHNS HOPKINS! Now I'm not suggesting that<br />\nHopkins is anysort of paradise; no... I rather think of<br />\nHopkins as a sanctuary, an intellectual retreat, a place to<br />\nthink and to get your act together. I'm sure you've all<br />\nheard stories of recently released convicts who<br />\ndeliberately break their paroles just to return to jail<br />\nbecause they find the outside world unsuitable for living.<br />\nWell, needless to say, that is exactly how I feel. In my<br />\nmemories of Homewood I seek the sense of permanance<br />\nso pervasive in childhood yet so abruptly absent in young<br />\nadulthood. I entered college a child and exited a<br />\nman-child; I scratch the surface of reminiscence to<br />\nuncover what might be clues to my present identity. But I<br />\ndo not need to dig any deeper than a vague yet powerful<br />\nepiphany suffered on the night of graduation last May.<br />\nThe upper quad was transformed into a vignette of a<br />\nbygone day, a scene out of a Booth Tarkington novel or a<br />\nGordon McRae musical. Under the big top of the tent,<br />\ntables and chairs had been unfolded on a wooden dance<br />\nfloor laid just for the occasion. The breeze whispered<br />\nmagic, while guys sweated in itchy monkey suits and girls<br />\nsqueezed into chiffon bodices left over from an<br />\nassortment of proms and cotillons. Couples swinged and<br />\nswayed to the lilting strains of the Bing Miller orchestra.<br />\nOh how that crooner made us swoon. I tried my<br />\ndamnedest to guide my well-bred partner around the<br />\nswirling vortexes of couples on the dance floor, but not<br />\nhaving the training of a bon vivant or the bark of Wilma<br />\nKruetzer to command, I lost both the time and beat, and<br />\nsoon we both tired of my spastic lurch. But, before we<br />\nretired from the dance floor for the pleasures of Cold<br />\nDuck and the flesh, I espied out of the corner of my eye a<br />\npicture of an aging professor dancing rather proudly and<br />\nelegantly with his wife. This bulbous professor known<br />\nbest for his gut--both his stomach and his course-- was, at<br />\nthe beginning of that last semester, the subject of our<br />\nridicule for his religious devotion to his study of the<br />\nsimplest things in nature. At first I laughed too, but as the<br />\nsemester lost ground, I soon gained a certain respect for<br />\nthis man with his bolo ties and stale jokes. Of all my<br />\nprofessors at Hopkins, he showed the most unabashed,<br />\nunashamed enthusiasm for the subject matter, and I.<br />\nsuspect he was one of the few, if not the only one, to<br />\nreally give a damn whether we learned. To be perfectly<br />\nhonest, I envied his contentment, his happiness, and I felt<br />\nsorry for him when jocks would sneak out of the class<br />\nwhile his back was turned. His trust in us was never<br />\nreciprocated. And here I was sharing the same (lance floor<br />\nwith him. This struck me as being terribly wrong. I had no<br />\nright to share the floor with him. I was a fraud; I had<br />\nflim-flammed my way through college, and here I was an<br />\naccepted participant in a ceremony that portended to be<br />\nan initiation into a higher place of existence, as if my<br />\ncollege diploma was a membership card to an informal<br />\nclub of elites. in essence, I was a gate crasher. As we were<br />\nleaving, a weight heavier than my girlfriend's head fell<br />\nupon my shoulder; I looked back at the scene and<br />\nsuddenly realized that the game was over. Hopkins and I<br />\nhad fought to a draw; if I had won this match, I would've<br />\nadvanced to the higher sea of graduate school. But my<br />\ndays of formal learning had been ended by this stalemate,<br />\nand it was time to say goodbye and to punish myself for<br />\nall the mistakes I had made. From out of nowhere for no<br />\nco t.proanyep.r flo4r.<br />\ngood reason popped into my mind Fritz Pens'<br />\nwayward Gestalt victims:<br />\nWelcome to The Real World, Mr. Graduate!<br />\nJump on in! We've been expecting you!<br />\nJust strip down, bend over, and the fun can begin...<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022:r \u2022'!'POIT<br />\n<br />\n\fPAdViVCNOVEMBER'17,\"197g<br />\n<br />\nCHUTE rim, ASK QUESTIOlt LATER<br />\nBY MARC NASDOR<br />\nThe tiny airplane, a DeHavilland Beaver, taxied to the<br />\nfar end of the grass runway. Into a compartment about<br />\nthe size of a Volkswagen, nine human beings were<br />\ncrammed into fetal positions. The pilot was awaiting the<br />\nsignal to take off, and when everything was all clear, we<br />\nbolted down the runway, taking off and ascending toward<br />\nthe thin clouds and blue sky behind them. The back of<br />\nmy neck tightened, bones shook and joints creaked. I<br />\ntook a deep breath and let out a sigh. The jumpmaster<br />\nplaced the first man in position by the open door. My left<br />\nhand clutched the reserve chute clipped to the harness on<br />\nmy stomach. I was to be number three.<br />\n\"Yes, there is the possibility of getting killed; but<br />\nlisten, more people by percentage have died on the golf<br />\ncourses,\" the burly gentleman at the front of the<br />\nclassroom reassured us. I let out a nervous chuckle.<br />\nHmmm...killed. Well, at least I wouldn't have to pay any<br />\nmore rent tp that money-grubbing landlord of mine. Then<br />\nI thought, \"Hey man, this is serious business, not King's<br />\nDominion. Do you have any idea what you're doing?\"<br />\nThe door to the classroom was open. Yes, it would be so<br />\neasy, just get up and run back to the car, to safety. A<br />\nlittle devil materialized on my shoulder. \"That's right,<br />\nwhy don't you run back to the car, you lunchmeat. Have<br />\nyou ever heard the sound of thirty-five people laughing<br />\ntheir heads off? They'll be laughing at you, at YOU!\" His<br />\ncounterpart appeared on my other shoulder, dressed in a<br />\nwhite toga. \"What will your grandmother say? Your poor<br />\nmother, being consoled by the funeral directors as the<br />\nhearse moves slowly toward the cemetary, it'll break her<br />\nheart.\" Then another thought occurred to me. I had just<br />\nshelled out thirty-five beans to take this class. After a few<br />\nseconds of thought, I succumbed to the fiscal persuasion.<br />\nIt was now or never.<br />\nActually, there was a certain excitement to it. I had<br />\nwanted to do this for over a year and had kept putting it<br />\noff. Was this to be the ultimate liberating experience, or<br />\nmerely an exprezion of my pronounced seif-destructive<br />\ntendencies? At that point I didn't seem to care. \"Just get<br />\nit over with!\"<br />\nThe first five hours of the instruction were spent in<br />\nthe classroom, learning about aerodynamics, equipment,<br />\nform, and emergency procedure. Five hours may seem<br />\nlike a lot of time to listen to one person speak, but when<br />\nyour life depends upon it, you listen. The aerodynamics<br />\nwere not all that complicated, simple enough for someone<br />\nlike myself who has never taken a science course at<br />\nHopkins. Basically, we were told how the parachute<br />\nworks. \"No, the landing force is not equivalent to<br />\njumping off a ten-story building. Relax.\" Most of the air<br />\npressure in an inflated, falling parachute is applied<br />\ndirectly to the top half of the canopy. Human body-sized<br />\n\"windows\"; were cut out of the sides of these particular<br />\nchutes to facilitate a primitive steering mechanism;<br />\nhowever, from,the \"low\" altitude of three thousand feet,<br />\naccording to the calculations made by the pilot, no matter<br />\nwhich way we steered, we would eventually land<br />\nsomewhere near the target spot. Looking at the map of<br />\nthe area taken from the height at which we were to jump,<br />\nI hoped that \"somewhere near\" didn't mean the trees or<br />\nthe electric wires. I guessed I would have to take my<br />\nchances.<br />\nThe equipment seemed excellent. The instructor<br />\nclaimed that these parachutes have only failed in one out<br />\nof five hundred thousand jumps.(Why the hell is he giving<br />\nus old equipment?) He corrected himself, reassuring us<br />\nthat they really weren't that old. Step by step he went<br />\nover the mechanics of the packs, the parachutes<br />\nthemselves, and the harnesses, unraveling a chute for us to<br />\nshow exactly how the beast worked. The backuPsystem<br />\nfor the reserve canopy was amazing; even if a person was<br />\nto black out while falling, in the event that the main<br />\ncanopy should fail, an electronic device would<br />\nautomatically eject the reserve when, at full velocity, the<br />\nbody fell to an altitude of one thousand feet. My wits<br />\ngradually came together.<br />\nThe next part of the class was concerned with form<br />\nand style when exiting from the aircraft and when<br />\nlanding. All I wanted to do was make sure I hit the Earth<br />\nand not the Moon. We were told that it was necessary for<br />\nthe safe operation of the parachute, that when leaving the<br />\nplane we should be spread-eagled and arched all the way<br />\nback, so that we would be falling stomach-down. Also, we<br />\nwere to count to seven as loud as we possibly could, and<br />\nby then the canopy would be completely open. Sure it<br />\nwould! We practiced for a while,jumping out of the door<br />\nof the plane while it was still on the ground. Finally he<br />\nshowed us how to land. The instructor claimed that the<br />\nlanding would be very soft, IF done correctly. He<br />\ndemonstrated how to fall and the class practiced for<br />\n<br />\nabout a half hour.<br />\nThere was still one hope. It had been drizzling all<br />\nmorning and we were told that there was a possibility that<br />\nwe would not be able to jump that day. So much for good<br />\nluck--the clouds somehow managed to vanish exactly at<br />\nthe moment the class ended. Maybe it would get dark and<br />\nmy turn wouldn't come up. Then the person at the front<br />\ndesk read the order in which we were to jump. Oh Christ.<br />\nI was to be in the first load. I numbly suited up: white<br />\njump suit, boots, and crash helmet. The words \"crash.<br />\ncrash, CRASH\" echoed between my ears. My mind was in<br />\na semi-stupor as the instructor tightened the harness<br />\naround my shoulders and between my legs. No getting out<br />\nof it now. The packs were heavy and a bit uncomfortable,<br />\nbut that was the last thing on my mind. Waiting for the<br />\nairplane to arrive, I stood around with my<br />\ncomrades-in-death and discussed exit procedure. I should<br />\nhave been thinking about philosophy, or maybe sex,<br />\ndrugs, and rock and roll. It was impossible, as the Chariot<br />\n<br />\nmetal insect, I felt no sensation of falling. I was thrown<br />\nout into the void and the plane went up. Time and space<br />\nseemed relative to my state of mind. I didn't black out;<br />\nrather, I blanked out for a split second. I wasn't positive<br />\nwhere I was, but all my fears suddenly left-me as I felt the<br />\ntug at my shoulders, signifying the opening of the blessed<br />\ncanopy. I looked up and everything was fine. It was the<br />\nbest rush I ever had. Since I was traveling with the wind,<br />\neverything was dead quiet for miles around, and I was<br />\nelated. As I approached the ground, I could hear one of<br />\nthe instructors calling out directions to me over a<br />\nloudspeaker. Radar would have been more helpful, but<br />\nthis was better than nothing. I landed softly in a field<br />\nabout fifty yards from the target. For the next hour, it<br />\nwas impossible to wipe the grin from my face. The feeling<br />\nof accomplishment was incredible; I felt that I had<br />\ncomplete control of my destiny. The feeling never left.<br />\nAfter everyone had jumped, the jumpmaster came<br />\nover to critique our performance. I got a perfect score,<br />\nnaturally. After going through hundreds of<br />\ncongratulations, we packed up and headed home.<br />\nNow I have a problem. I have become obsessed with<br />\nthe sport. I'm trying to save every penny because I plan to<br />\njump again over Thanksgiving. As far as I'm concerned,<br />\nthere's no getting away from it. I recommend parachuting<br />\nto anyone in reasonably good shape, regardless of sex or<br />\nbody build. You will never regret it. Its therapeutic value<br />\noutdoes a thousand psychiatrists. Let your adventurous<br />\nspirit carry you to its limitless boundaries. All you have to<br />\ndo is say \"yes.\"<br />\nFor those interested in taking up this sport, or at<br />\nleast trying it once, the Pelican Sport Parachuting Center<br />\nis located in Ridgely, Maryland on the Eastern Shore,<br />\nabout twenty minutes on the other side of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay Bridge.

When people ask about my<br />\ncollege career, I reply, quite candidly, I wasted the<br />\nopportunity. I had failed to achieve what I really<br />\nwanted--a good enough record to force my way into a<br />\nclinical psychology program. I realize that I am the only<br />\none to blame. In fact, my years at Hopkins were the best<br />\nyears of my life. So, when I do remember Hopkins, and I<br />\ndo most every day, my mind returns to that final vision of<br />\nthe professor and his wife, and my eyes inevitably tear, as<br />\nmuch in pleasure, and in pain.<br />\nAn unfortunate skydiver finds himself up a tree.<br />\nof Doom had just landed on the runway, and was now<br />\nslowly ambling its way toward us like a flying monster<br />\nout of a Japanese science fiction movie. One by one, we<br />\nclimbed into the monster's side and squished ourselves<br />\ninto its belly.<br />\nThree thousand feet above the ground, the earth<br />\nlooked like the typical patchwork quilt one would expect<br />\nto see; but I wouldn't know, since my own eyes were<br />\nslammed shut. With some work I pried them open, only,<br />\nto see the first man sitting right on the doorway, half in<br />\nhalf out. The plane was noisy and I couldn't hear what<br />\nanyone was saying. The jumpmaster placed his hand.<br />\nunder the initial victim's right buttock and shoved him<br />\nout into oblivion. I prayed to my guardian angel for help,<br />\nand he was<br />\nbut I had forgotten that this was his week<br />\nstill vacationing in Trinidad. Before I knew it, the second,<br />\nperson was over and out. I tried to look out the window<br />\nto see where he dropped, but he was nowhere in sight.<br />\nMaybe he was carried off to Miami by a flock of geese. I<br />\nfelt a tap on my shoulder...\"What! Who me?\" He<br />\nmotioned for me to put my legs out the door and<br />\nattached my static line to the plane, which would open<br />\nthe chute automatically. Without thinking, I did as he<br />\ncommanded. The force of the wind was overwhelming; I<br />\ncould hardly keep myself from being blown back into the<br />\nplane. \"ARE YOU READY?\" he screamed. \"YES\" I<br />\nscreamed back. I wasn't going to let him push me. I had<br />\ngotten this far and if I was going to do it, I was going to<br />\ndo it. \"GO!\" he shouted.<br />\nWhat was the feeling like? I'm not sure I can<br />\nadequately describe it in words, but I'll try. It was like<br />\nbeing born (not born again). Ejected out of the gut of this<br />\n<br />\norf<br />\n<br />\nIt is a Sunday morning late in October, not long after<br />\nmy birthday, when the trees are burning with the color of<br />\ndeath.

Greek tragedy<br />\nin which Medea, in revenge for being betrayed by her<br />\nhusband Jason (of the Golden Fleece)imurdeis their three<br />\nchildren. Psychologists tell us that our strongest instinct,<br />\nbeyond the sex drive, beyond the need for food, is the<br />\nmaternal bond\u201e the love of a mother for her offspring.<br />\nInfanticide is the most heinous crime we have; it violates<br />\nour most inviolable trust. It is worsened when the child is<br />\ntotally innbcent of any crime, and multiplied beyond<br />\nreality when there are three innocent children. Can our<br />\nmodern day sensibilities comprehend this crime, or are<br />\nthe classic plots too distant, too primordial, for our jaded<br />\nsenses?<br />\nDirector Jules Dassm recaptures the majesty of the<br />\nclassics in a relevant form in his most recent film, A<br />\nDream of Passion. It is the story of an aging, Greek-born<br />\nactress, Maya (Melinda Mercouri) who returns home to<br />\nAthens in the waning days of her Hollywood film career.<br />\nShe had made it in Hollywood when there was avogue for<br />\nexotic, well-built foreign-accented beauties (Loren,<br />\nCardinale, Lollabridgida). Now, her face and body are<br />\nbeginning to sag, and she is rejected by the merciless eye<br />\nof the camera.<br />\nShe comes home to rediscover her roots, and a husband<br />\nthat she has left behind. She comes home to rediscover<br />\nher art, the classic power of an actress to express our<br />\ndeepest emotions. And she comes home to assess the life<br />\nshe has lived--the life of a modern day woman slightly<br />\nhyperbolized by the hectic paced, bizarre world of<br />\nHollywood.<br />\nShe is to star in The Medea, which is being produced<br />\nboth in Classical Greek for the Athenian outdoor stage<br />\nand in English for a BBC-production pf a show called<br />\n\"The Creative Process.\" Both are being directed by her<br />\nformer lover, Costa (Jules Dassin), who has very firm<br />\ninterpretive ideas about the play. He wants to recapture<br />\nits miginal mystery, its witchcraft. Above all, he wants to<br />\nkeep it free from any note of.today's \"feminist bullshit.\"<br />\nAs a publicity stunt to promote the production and<br />\nMaya's sagging career, someone discohters that there is a<br />\npresent day Medea in jail in Athens for murdering her<br />\nthree children in a jealous rage over her husband's<br />\ninfidelity. We indeed have modern day tragic heroes and<br />\nrl up in our jails and asylums and<br />\nheroines, they are It<br />\nare labeled insane.<br />\nMaya arranges to meet Brenda (Ellen Burstyn), the<br />\nMedea of Golthi, and she brings a team of photographers<br />\n<br />\nMadman and the Nun<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nDream of Passion<br />\n<br />\nand journalists, to film \"the meeting of the two Medeas.\"<br />\nFor one tender moment while the journalists wait behind<br />\na closed door, they talk behind the bars of the prison<br />\nconference room. \"Thank you for coming. I hardly get<br />\nany visitors.\" The door explodes and photographers and<br />\njournalists burst through in a disgusting orgy of flashing<br />\ncameras. The meeting is violated. It is one of the most<br />\nshocking scenes I have ever witnessed.<br />\nThus begins the relationship which guides the rest of<br />\nthe movie. Maya is possessed by guilt over her abhorrent<br />\nact and it provokes a crisis in her life. She creeps guiltily<br />\nback to the prison, bearing flowers and Brenda agrees to<br />\nsee her. She discovrrs in Brenda not only a real life model<br />\nfor her role, as Medea, but in a strange way a paradigm for<br />\nthe sojourn of a modern woman. She also finds a friend.<br />\nBurstyn is superb in this delicate role. She ranges<br />\nbetween the calm and conversational, but not quite ever<br />\nwholly sane, and the burning, violent, ecstatic rage of a<br />\nwoman still capable of slaughtering her children again.<br />\nThe director leaVes no doubt that we are dealing with a<br />\ndangerously insane psychopath, and not a modern<br />\nheroine. Yet in a curious way she represents the plight of<br />\nthe modern woman, both as victim and as criminal.<br />\nThis is what Maya perceives, the link between her own<br />\nexperiences and those of this pathetic murderess. Maya<br />\ncan find that one infinitesimal kernal of justification for<br />\nBrenda's act, her absolute outrage at being betrayed.<br />\nPerhaps it really is understandable so long as it happens<br />\nonly once in two thousand years, expressing the<br />\ncumulated rage of all womankind.<br />\nMercouri as Maya is at her finest. She has fully<br />\ntranscended the stereotyPed sex-goddess role, and has<br />\n<br />\njibiqtertaimept<br />\n<br />\nWelles<br />\n<br />\nWar has been depicted in many different lights. It can<br />\nexpose a tragic side of human nature and an heroic side; a<br />\nhorrible side and even an absurd side. The problem for the<br />\nmoviemakers has remained, however, how to portray war<br />\nin an outrightly funny way, without having it lapse into<br />\nbanality a la Hogan 's Heroes. King of Hearts, a comical<br />\naccount of one of the unforseen effects of war, is able to<br />\ndo just this and yet still furnish the viewer with a clear<br />\nand significant message.<br />\nKing of Hearts is set in World War 1 France The<br />\nGermans are planning to blow up a town on the other 'side<br />\nof the river and the English are intent on stopping them.<br />\nHow to accomplish this? Well, the first step is to find an<br />\nexpert on bombs who speaks perfect French. Once in<br />\ntown, maybe he will be able to deactivate the explosives.<br />\nThe only catch is that there is no French-speaking bomb<br />\nexpert. in the Oritish garrison, so the Colonel must settle<br />\nfor the next best thing--a French-speaking bird expert. Of<br />\ncourse, Private Plumpick has no idea of what he is doing,<br />\nand upon arrival he encounters some Gerpan soldiers and<br />\nhides in an insane asylum. The basic premise of the movie<br />\nis that Plumpick unwittingly releases all the inmates, who<br />\nthen take over the now-evacuated town. They begin to<br />\nassume all sorts of pretend roles, and set up their 'own<br />\nplay \"kingdom.\" The title of the film comes about<br />\nbecausc the hapless Plumpick is named the King of Hearts<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nfi<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nby 14 4.1<br />\nDavid<br />\nKaplan<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\nAbsurd<br />\nLight of<br />\nar<br />\n<br />\n-4 I<br />\ndespite his warnings and protestations.<br />\nThere is a lot of humorous material in this situation W<br />\nexploit, and Director Phillippe de Broca exploits it with<br />\ndeftness and skill. Much of the material reminded me of.<br />\nsome of the things done in Monty Python, and indeed the \u2022<br />\nhumor can be very broad and very hilarious. All<br />\ncharacters are played in a comic style and the entire<br />\nsituation is absurd from the outset. It is very easy to<br />\nsimply have a good time watching the movie without<br />\nderiving any additional illumination.<br />\nBut the message is clearly there. King of Hearts is<br />\n<br />\ngrown into a fine and mature actress. Her performance is<br />\nstrong and resonant, and she is playing a character that so<br />\nclosely parallels herself that it is clear that Maya is based<br />\non Mereouri's biography. Indeed, the Greek version of<br />\nThe Medea that we witness in the film actually took<br />\nplace, as an outdoor play starring Mercouri in Athens.<br />\nAlso, Jules Dassin, the directorond Mercouri are husband<br />\nand wife.<br />\nThe film is well made and balanced. There is no<br />\nattempt to create a false air of mystery by engulfing this<br />\nfilip in dark shadows. Everything is filmed<br />\nstraightforwardly in clear light. Dark moodiness is<br />\nreserved for the places where it belongs--in the sequences<br />\nthat show the actual production of The Medea.<br />\nMaya uses her conversations with Brenda to grow in her<br />\nrole as Medea, and we witness the growing pains qf the<br />\ncreative process. At the same time she is reaching the<br />\nheight of her creative powers, she is coming to terms with<br />\nher own life. The film climaxes in \u2018,a sequence in which<br />\nMaya delineates the real parallels between her life and<br />\nBrenda's\u2014it is a story of the tawdriness of her climb to<br />\nfame, of her betrayals and self-degradation.<br />\nThis is a thoroughly engrossing film. Its one flaw is tha':<br />\nthe director too slavishly follows the techniques of his<br />\nacknowledged mentor, Ingmar Bergman. One sequence, in<br />\nwhich everyone is sitting around a clip of Liv Ullman<br />\nfrom Persona which closely parallels the main theme of<br />\nthe film, is nothing more than homage from student to<br />\nteacher. It should have been edited out. On the whole,<br />\nthough, A Dream of d'assion is a film that should not be<br />\nmissed.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nPresentation Hail<br />\nThe Wild Geese Mary Avnrt<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\ndefinitely an anti-war film and de Broca has a lot to say,<br />\nespecially when one considers that it was made in 1967.<br />\nAs the movie proceeds, and as,both the \"lunatics\" and the<br />\nsoldiers are represented, it becomes obvious that the<br />\nsoldiers are. the true lunatics and that the inmates have<br />\nmore real sanity than the outside world. In the pretend<br />\n\"kingdom,\" there is indeed madness, but there is a kind<br />\nof method in the madness. The play world possesses a<br />\ncertain sobriety which the \"real\" world does not. Both<br />\ngroups are playing games, bu' the inmates at leas i play<br />\ngames which are harmless, and they wish them to remain<br />\nthat way. When Plumpick tries to lead them out of town,<br />\nthey hear the sounds of the artillery and refuse -to<br />\ncontinue, shouting, \"there are wild beasts out theit!\" One<br />\ncan easily see the wisdom of their decision--it is better to<br />\nlive in a world of illusion than in a world of terrifying<br />\nabsurdity.<br />\nKing of Hearts has become something of a cult,film,<br />\nand it is possible to see why. A film which is both as<br />\nfunny and as serious as this one is a rare treat. De Broca<br />\ndoes a fabulous directing job, and Alan Bates sits well in<br />\nthe role of Private Plumpick. However, I believe that most<br />\nof the credit belongs to the minor characters, for they. in<br />\nfact make the movie. King cf Hearts will be playing in<br />\nShriver Hall on November 17th and 18th, at both 7:30<br />\n\u2022<br />\nand 10:00.<br />\n<br />\n\f\"- NEWS-MIER \"I<br />\n<br />\n17(<br />\n<br />\n'The Wild Geese'Captures African Warfare<br />\nBurton and Harris Are True Mercenaries<br />\ntime Faulkner, having made his last raid, must console the<br />\ndead Jaander's son, the hardened old soldier has truly and<br />\npoignantly softened.<br />\nRoger Moore is adequate as the cigar chewing Shawn<br />\nFlynn, the daredevil who can fly all planes and take all<br />\npositions without muss,ing his hair.

In an example of<br />\n<br />\nBY DAN WILE<br />\nFinally someone has made a credible film about<br />\nmercenaries and contemporary Africa! Andrew<br />\nMacLaglan's The Wild Geese is such a movie, and given<br />\nthe sensitivity of the subject, there are surprisingly few<br />\nshowbiz copouts. He depicts mercenaries as complex<br />\nhumans rather than fanatics or thugs, and Africa comes<br />\noff as something other than the home of Idi Amin or<br />\nDaktari.<br />\nThe plot concerns a scheme by English mining<br />\nmagnate Sir Edward Matherson (Stewart Granger) to<br />\ncontrol the huge copper resources of a central African<br />\ncountry ruled by a tin horn despot. Sir Edward must free<br />\nJulius Lumbani, the revered and soon to be wasted<br />\nindependence leader, who will supposedly start a revolt.<br />\nThe tycoon hires Allen Faulkner (Richard Burton), an<br />\nover the hill soldier of fortune, to do the job. Faulkner<br />\nand three other veterans (Richard Harris, Roger Moore,<br />\nand Hardy Kruger) train a company, free Lumbani, only<br />\nto be stranded by Matherson in the bush, with nowhere to<br />\nflee.<br />\nThe film has some surprisingly fine performances,<br />\nespecially by Harris, who deserves a good part after such<br />\nturkeys as Orca and The Cassandra Crossing. Harris is<br />\nRafer Jaanders, Faulkner's old comrade in arms, and a<br />\ncrack planner. Jaanders only agrees to leave his<br />\ncomfortable English home and his lovely son because he<br />\nhas always believed in Lumbani. This idealism and love<br />\nseem genuinely compatible with a commando's<br />\nruthlessness. At the end Jaanders, who has saved the unit<br />\nby leading a rear guard, cannot reach the taxiing plane, as<br />\nhe is pursued by the enemy. He asks Faulkner to kill him<br />\nso as not to be ravaged by the soldiers. Harris and Burton<br />\nare good enough actors so that this scene is not at all<br />\nh okey.<br />\nBurton's Faulkner is sympathetically ignoble, for the<br />\nmercenary admits his own responsibility for being a social<br />\nmisfit. One empathizes with the futility of his position<br />\nwhen he realizes he has been betrayed. Indeed, by the<br />\n<br />\nunbelieveable symbolism, Coetzee volunteers, to carry the<br />\nailing Lumbani on his back through the bush. During the'<br />\nmarch, the black and white argue politics, and the<br />\nAfrikaner addresses Lumbani as \"Kaffir\" (the South<br />\nAfrican term for nigger). Hold on now! Afrikaners simply<br />\ndon't do that. To symbolize his conversion from racism,<br />\nKruger finally calls Lumbani \"bloke.\" C'mon now! Give<br />\nthe Afrikaners a break.

It is impossible to reconcile<br />\nblack and white in Southern Africa and to trace a<br />\ncomplex mercenary operation all in two hours of film.<br />\nWhen the South African dies, the camera focuses in on<br />\nLumbani's black hand clasping Coetzee's white hand.<br />\nWhere's the violin music, boys?<br />\nDespite this mistake, the direction is otherwise<br />\nexcellent. The recruitment of the mercenaries, who join<br />\nfor every possible reason, is amusingly believable. The<br />\nbush lighting scenes have that very tense, yet 'very<br />\nsporadic, speed which characterizes that type of warfare.<br />\nHowever, the decimated unit should not slowly<br />\nretreat along a road,.it should be scattered in the bush. No<br />\nwonder it gets mauled! The opening parachute jump from<br />\nan old Dakota is as good as that in A Bridge Too Far.<br />\nThe scenery does not look like the California<br />\nMonsanto woods, for the film was shot in South Africa's<br />\nNorthern Transvaal, true bush country. Africa's terrifying<br />\nvastness, so vividly depicted, is a perfect contrast to<br />\nMatherson's insensitively plush London digs.<br />\nPerhaps the film was more meaningful for me<br />\nbecause I saw it in Pretoria three days after its<br />\nJohannesburg world premiere last summer. The lines were<br />\nas long as any I have seen for a film in the States, and<br />\nSouth African soldiers and armored cars were on display.<br />\nA few hundred kilometers north of this opulence,<br />\nRhodesia was being chewed apart. Fifteen years before,<br />\nMike Hoare and Jean Schramme, perhaps the world's two<br />\nmost famous mercenaries, were in the Congo.

Unfortunately, this<br />\nmaxim also refers to plays. The Madman and the Nun,<br />\nwritten in 1923 by the Polish playwright Stanislaw<br />\nWitkiewicz and currently produced by the Barnstormers,<br />\nis sadly outdated.<br />\nThe theme is typical: madmen are saner than their<br />\nkeepers. This theme was better done in The King of<br />\nHearts. In Madman a self-tortured poet tries to free<br />\nhimself from a mental hospital and finds a fellow-sufferer<br />\nin the nun who tries to cure him. Psychiatrists, orderlies,<br />\nthe Mother Superior are, without exception cruel and<br />\nunconcerned with the recovery of the patient. Naturally,<br />\nthey go insane at the end, while the inmates--the nun, the<br />\nmadman, and even the sadistic doctor--go free.<br />\nThough the Barnstormers try, they cannot surmount<br />\nthe great handicap of the play's datedness. Especially<br />\ndevastating is the trite, restrictive dialogue. For example,<br />\nthe madman rants about the stage, accusing \"form\" of<br />\nwining the imagination, a- standard 1920's gripe. He<br />\nlaments that society has turned into a machine and that<br />\nhis cure in the mental hospital has perpetuated his<br />\nmadness. At another point, Sister Anna moans, \"Now<br />\nthere's nothing--only a terrible, hopeless emptiness. I<br />\ndon't exist anymore.\" After making love with the<br />\nMadman, she offers to remain at the mental hospital if<br />\nthat were necessary to free him. \"I love you for what you<br />\n<br />\nare. You must fulfill your destiny...It's creativity. Perhaps<br />\nit's God.\" The only character to profit from this type of<br />\ndialogue is the Freudian psychoanalyst, Dr. Grun. Dressed<br />\nas Sigmund Freud, replete with beard, pipe and notebook,<br />\nhe is hilarious. In one of his classic lines he says: \"His (the<br />\nmadman's) breathing has stopped. Not even<br />\npsychoanalysis can help him now.\"<br />\nNevertheless, the actors and the director perform a<br />\ncreditable job in bringing the play to life with spirited,<br />\nphysical action and interesting blocking and makeup. Bill<br />\nNewlin, as Alexander Walpurg, the madman-poet, runs,<br />\njumps, and bangs his head against the wall and floor of his<br />\npadded cell, torn by his thwarted artistic passion and his<br />\ndaily doses of morphine--an early twentieth-century<br />\nBaudelaire. Unfortunately, his leaps from savagery to<br />\ntenderness are too sudden to allow the audience to<br />\nempathize with him. The stereotypical dialogue also<br />\ncontributes to the feeling that neither unchained<br />\nindividualism nor restrictive society is human. Melissa<br />\nKirschner (Sister Anna) does surprisingly well with lines<br />\nthat permit her little leeway from passivity and<br />\ndominance by the madman. She is the only sympathetic<br />\ncharacter in the play.<br />\nThe heavy, white-and-black stage make-up is effective<br />\nin creating a scene out of Anais Nin's \"Theatre of<br />\nCruelty.\" That every character except for the nun and the<br />\nmadman wear this make-up strikingly shows up the<br />\ndifference between the sensitive prisoners and the<br />\n.Cont. on p. 18<br />\n<br />\nTHE EFFECT UPON<br />\n<br />\nTHE AUDIENCE ISDEVASTATING<br />\n<br />\nHistoric Preservation Hall, at 726 St. Peter Street in<br />\nthe French Quarter of New Orleans, is where New<br />\nOrleans jazz is preserved.

It has never been<br />\nviewed in Maryland, and the distributor of the film<br />\ndidn't want to contend with powerful, and sometimes<br />\nirrational censor board. So, the film series was unable to<br />\nobtain the film.<br />\nSuch policies are now common among many film<br />\ndistributors working with Maryland markets They don't<br />\nwant to deal with the last Board of Censors in the nation<br />\nor with 68 year old Mary Avara, who, along with two<br />\npart-time aides, has total dictatorial powers over what<br />\nwill and will not be screened for public viewing in<br />\nMaryland. The distributors will not argue with Avara<br />\nwho can rule that a film is either cut or it will not be<br />\nshown in Maryland.<br />\nCensorship of films by the board depends solely on<br />\nthe subjective opinion of Mrs. Avara, and her opinions<br />\nare determined by the degree of sex in the film She<br />\ncannot ban a film because of violence, language, or<br />\nartistic quality, but only on the basis of the amount of<br />\nsex and how explicity it is. Of course no one should be<br />\nable to prohibit public screening of a film based on the<br />\nquality of the film but should someone be able to ban<br />\nfilms based on the quality of the sex? Mrs. Avara is<br />\nsupposedly looking out for the morals of the State of<br />\nMaryaland, but in the Seventies, her board is certainly<br />\nobselete, and even repressive, controlling what we<br />\nshould and should not see<br />\nShe has tried to ban Aguirre, The Wrath of God, a<br />\nfilm by Wener Herzog which is part of the renaissance of<br />\nGerman cinema. It has been screened three times in<br />\nBaltimore this fall Once by the very respectable<br />\nBaltimore Film Forum), and although it has some<br />\ngraphic scenes, it is also serious, artististic cinema. In the<br />\npast Avara has tried cutting scenes of cunnilingus and<br />\nother things from some of John Waters' films. These<br />\nfilms always get a X rating, but she has tried to cut these<br />\nsnipets which she feels should not be viewed by<br />\nMaryland filmgoers. A cut, though, usually ruins the<br />\nprint of the film, and can completely alter the<br />\n<br />\nsignificance of a scene. The Maryland Board of Censor is<br />\nnot .only hatmful to the freedom of the public to view<br />\nwhatever films they choose, but it also unresponsive to<br />\nthe artistic achievement of many fine filmmakers.<br />\nEven an ignorant public would be able to decide<br />\nwhether they wanted to see a hard core porno flick or<br />\nnot, but Avara and her board must consider Marylanders<br />\nvery ignorant. And while the argument of banning<br />\npornography could be strong, Mrs. Avara also wants to<br />\nban films like Pretty Baby. She didn't like the portrayal<br />\nof a 12 year old girl selling her virginity to the highest<br />\nbidder. What Avara fails to see because she is looking<br />\nonly for illicit sex or decadent morals is the implicit art<br />\nof the scene. She does not realize that the scene is not<br />\ncalculated to offend or excite the viewer, but is closely<br />\ntied to the narrative and the ideas of the film as a whole.<br />\nInstead of Through the Looking Glass, the Senior<br />\nClass Film Series is showing Monty Python's And Now<br />\nFor Something Completely Different. This film is a<br />\ncollection of skits and episodes from their popular<br />\ntelevision series, and the laughter and enjoyments is<br />\nbetter sustained throughtout the film than in their full<br />\nlength comedies. Whereas with Looking Glass viewers<br />\nmight have run to the Rat to find partners for the new<br />\nthings they learned, with Monty Python, the whole<br />\ncampus will be subjected to versions of silly walks,<br />\ngumbies, twits and other Python sketches throughout<br />\nthe weekend.

Citizen Kane, considered the most<br />\nperfect American film, is the fascinating character study<br />\nof the powerful newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane,<br />\npatterned after the character of William Randolph<br />\nHearst. Welles gives a cinematic tour-de-force producing,<br />\ndirecting, writing and playing the part of Kane .in this<br />\nextraordinary film. The Magnificent Ambersons was<br />\nWelles' next production, and is the complex lament for a<br />\nbygone period in American history and the values bound<br />\nup in that time.

The young Blue<br />\nJays will have to replace two key<br />\nstarters who graduated last year<br />\nand overcome a very difficult<br />\nschedule if they are to achieve<br />\nthis goal, but they should<br />\ndefinitely improve on last year's<br />\n11-13 record.<br />\nInexperience could be a<br />\n<br />\nproblem for Hopkins this' year<br />\nthere are only four returning<br />\nregulars on the team, and seven<br />\nof the fourteen players are<br />\nfreshmen. The four veterans with<br />\nsignificant game experience are<br />\nswingman Kevin Kabat (Senior<br />\nCaptain), center David Nagelberg<br />\n(Senior), guard Tony Devlin<br />\n(Junior), and guard Duey Levine<br />\n(Junior). Other returners are<br />\nSophomores Joe Vales and Jim<br />\nSpiegel. The team could receive a<br />\nbig boost if Sophomore Marty<br />\nO'Connor is able to overcome a<br />\nknee injury and return to action.<br />\nThose veterans will have to do<br />\nmore than just play well if the<br />\n<br />\nJays are to be successful this<br />\nyear.

Wilson Sick and Bill<br />\nSmiddy led the attack by scoring<br />\n7 of the Hopkins goals.<br />\nIn the next match Saturday<br />\nnight, November 11th, the Blue<br />\nJays met the team that would<br />\n<br />\neventually prove to be the<br />\nEastern champions, Boston<br />\nCollege. The Blue Jay defense,<br />\nwhich yielded the fewest goals of<br />\nany team in the tournament,<br />\nallowed only 13 goals during the<br />\ntOurnament.

Although Hopkins<br />\nplayers felt they should have<br />\nblown these opponents out of<br />\nthe water, Morris-Harvey kept<br />\nthings interesting by holding the<br />\nscore close throughout the<br />\n<br />\nmatch.

Fishbein felt it was too<br />\nall -encompassing, leaving the<br />\nUniversity open to possible<br />\nlawsuits. The term \"due<br />\nprocess,\" in particular, was<br />\nconsidered likely to cause a legal<br />\ntangle. Senior Class President<br />\nMonroe Zeffert questioned the<br />\nwording of the sixth clause of<br />\nthe Article, which provides for<br />\nprotection from double jeopardy.<br />\nIt was then suggested by Council<br /><br />\nVice-President Bruce Smith that<br />\nthe terms \"fair trial\" and \"due<br />\nprocess\" need to be defined.\"We<br />\ndon't want to make it too<br />\nlegalistic,\" responded Simon.<br />\nRobert Elkin, Junior Class<br />\nRepresentative, proposed that<br />\nthe word \"trial\" be changed to<br />\n\"hearing.\"<br />\nDiscussion then shifted to the<br />\nright of an accused student to<br />\nrepresentation. Simon pointed<br />\niout that this right \"should be<br />\nincluded in all cases,\" but there<br />\nwas disagreement on the exact<br />\nform the representation should<br />\ntake. Fishbein had suggested that<br />\n\"counsel\" should be someone<br />\nfrom within the University<br />\ncommunity. Sophomore Class<br />\nPresident Coos Hamburger<br />\nsupported this viewpoint by<br />\narguing that \"not all students can<br />\nafford a lawyer.\" Most Council<br />\nmembers agreed that should a<br />\nstudent hire a lawyer to defend<br />\nhim, the prosecution (i.e. the<br />\nUniversity), would be forced to<br />\nhire professional counsel, both to<br />\nmake the hearing fair and in<br />\norder to have any chance of<br />\nwinning the case.<br />\nThe Council postponed<br />\nmaking any decision until next<br />\nweek. Simon asked members to<br />\nsuggest revisions to the draft in<br />\nthe meantime.<br /><br />\nretain 10 additional custodial<br />\nwo:kers because of increase in<br />\nmaintenance required by the<br />\nopening of Mudd Hall.<br />\nMeasuring efficiency in terms<br />\nof completed work schedules,<br />\nCampbell stated that the present<br />\nstaff is more efficient than before<br />\nthe change, because by working<br />\nat night custodians have ready<br />\naccess to more rooms<br />\nGRO Representative Carlton<br />\nHaywood, present at the Zdanis<br />\nmeeting, reported that the<br />\nAssociate Provost admitted his<br />\ninability to demonstrate any<br /><br />\nAt a meeting Wednesday with<br />\na group of concerned students<br />\nbacked by several student<br />\norganizations, Associate Provost<br />\nand Vice President for<br />\nAdminislrative Services Richard<br />\nA.

Jenny Adams<br />\ninterviewed some 20 of the 45<br />\ncustodial workers currently on<br />\nthe night shift. Interviews were<br />\nlimited to fiftee:i minutes and,<br />\nthough requested to leave,<br />\nsupervisors remained.<br />\nThe student group has raised<br />\nquestions concerning the manner<br />\nin which the decision was<br />\nimplemented. Although the<br />\n\u2022 University conducted a man-hour<br />\nsurvey last year, comparing the<br />\nproductivity of employees from<br />\nthe three shifts, it declined an<br />\nopportunity to consult a<br />\ncost-benefit analysis efficiency<br />\nexpert. The administration<br />\nnotified employees and their<br />\nunion about the change one<br />\nmonth, 10 days before<br />\nimplementation, without<br />\nconsulting either group<br />\nbeforehand. On the basis of<br />\nseniority, supervisors offered first<br />\nand second shift employees their<br />\nchoice of positions on the three<br />\nshifts. According to Campbell,<br />\nthey went through 17 people<br />\nbefore filling the eight available<br />\nfirst and second shift positions.<br /><br />\nCustodial workers claimed the<br />\nquestion was put to them as a<br />\nchoice between changing to the<br />\nthird shift or \"taking a walk<br />\ndown Charles Street.\" Aside<br />\nfrom a $.15 per hour wage<br />\nincrease for those switching from<br />\nthe first to the third shift, no<br />\ncompensation was offered.<br />\nThe concerned students also<br />\nquestioned the propriety of the<br />\ndecision itself. Campbell stated<br />\nthat he had requested an<br />\nestimated $200,000 more for the<br />\nfiscal year than he received.<br />\n$100,000 was to have been made<br />\nup through the efficiency<br />\n'produced by the switch to the<br />\n,night shift, with the remaining<br />\n$100,000 compensated for in<br />\nseveral ways, such as through<br />\nmore efficient use of energy.<br />\nCampbell claimed he could not<br />\nconceive of any viable alternative<br />\nto the change to night shift,<br />\nexcept laying off employees and<br />\nthereby sacrificing efficiency or<br />\nresorting to cleaning on alternate<br />\ndays which would also decrease<br />\nthe amount of work custodians<br />\ncould effectively carry through.<br />\n\"We cannot maintain the level of<br />\ncustodial maintenance now at the<br />\nprese:It budget level if we return<br />\npersonnel to their old shifts,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nCustodial workers claimed the<br />\nmove was actually motivated by<br />\nthe desire of administrators to<br />\nbring in sub-contract workers<br />\nwho would work for lower wages<br />\nand would pose no labor<br />\nrelations problems. They said<br />\nthat five people have been fired<br /><br />\nsince the July 10th decision.<br />\nAccording to Adams, Head of<br />\nHousekeeping Vic Zanella stated<br />\nthat he expected an attrition rate<br />\nof 50% in response to the shift.<br />\nCampbell said this remark<br />\nrepresented a \"hunch\" on the<br />\npart of Zanella, not a hopeful<br />\nexpectation that workers would<br />\nquit. He noted that the attrition<br />\nrate was not \"terribly unusual\",<br />\nafter the change. Campbell added<br />\nthat although the University<br />\ncould save a substantial amount<br />\nof money by bringing in<br />\nsub-contract workers, it would<br />\nsuffer a serious loss of efficiency<br />\namong employees because they<br />\nwould have no \"vested interest\"<br />\nin the institution.<br />\nCampbell stated that 4<br /><br />\nworkers retired as of June 10th.<br />\nSince the decision was<br />\nimplemented, 4 other workers<br />\nhave left their jobs. Campbell<br />\nstated that two of these failed to<br />\nreport for work for three days<br />\nand did not 'call the University,<br />\nand that the other two `possibly'<br />\nquit.\" He added, \"No one has<br />\nbeen released from the University<br />\nas a result of the change.\"<br />\nAccording to the group of<br />\nstudents who spoke to the<br />\nStudent Council Wednesday<br />\nnight, Dr. Zdanis based his<br />\noriginal decision on a cost-benefit<br />\nanalysis, which would require<br />\nconcessions on the part of the<br />\nUniversity and of the custodians.<br />\nStudent Jerry Spada argued that<br />\nthi tradeoff was not fair; people<br /><br />\nwho could ill afford it were being<br />\nasked to bear the financial<br />\nburden. Many custodial workers<br />\nare blacks, women, and non-U.S.<br />\ncitizens, some without high<br />\nschool diplomas. If the option<br />\nbeing offered them is between<br />\nnight work and quitting, many<br />\nare in effect coerced to stay<br />\nbecause of the near-impossibility<br />\nof securing other employment.<br />\nThe student group noted that Dr.<br />\nMuller, Dr. Zdanis and Campbell<br />\nhave all expressed concern about<br />\nthe \"human interest\" sacrificed<br />\nin the interests of budget.

He feels that the<br />\nreason that the Student .Council<br />\nTreasurer is head of the SAC<br />\nBoard is because of the existence \u2022<br />\nof the subcommittees. Further,<br />\nthe Student Council should<br />\nformally define the SAC<br />\nExecutive Board as head of the<br />\nfinancial structure of all student<br /><br />\nactivities, he said.<br />\nAccording to Fink, too much<br />\nmoney is spent on duplications<br />\nfor publicity purposes. He<br />\nproposed establishing a<br />\ncontingency fund to purchase a<br />\nproduction system or to devise<br />\nan agreement to use News-Letter<br />\nfacilities under which the groups<br />\nwould only have to pay labor<br />\ncosts. The SAC would pay for all<br />\nmaterials used.<br />\nThe Executive Board will also<br />\nallocate seed money rather than<br />\nfull budgets to groups that could<br />\npotentially make a profit. The<br />\nfunds will allow the group to<br /><br />\nstart operating, but it will have to<br /><br />\nreturn the money or a percentage<br />\nonce it begins to show a profit.<br />\nAccording to Fink, the system<br />\nhas worked with the Spring Fair,<br />\nwhich used to have a yearly<br />\nallocation but which always was<br />\nin the red.

Touring<br />\nBaltimore, to get support and<br />\nraise money, the League has been<br />\nendoresed by the Hopkins Black<br />\nStudent Union and the<br />\nChaplain's Office.<br />\nOvert Racism in the rural<br />\nSouth is commor, says the<br />\nLeauge:Tupelo, where the average<br />\nBlack income is half, and the<br />\nunemploymend is double the<br />\nWhite community's, has an active<br />\nand well- respected KuKlux Klan<br />\nchapter. Lewis Myers a lawyer<br />\nworking with the United League,<br />\nclaimed there is more racism in<br />\nMississippi and the South in 1978<br />\nthan in 1958. All the things you<br />\nread and hear in the Media about<br />\nthe new South are wrong.\"<br />\nThe events which triggered the<br />\ncurrent movement were the<br />\nmurders of two blacks by Tupelo<br />\npolice (who are all white) last<br />\nMarch, and many other alleged<br />\ncases of police brutality against<br />\nBlacks. The United League is<br />\ndemanding the dismissal of<br />\nflagrantly brutal policemen and<br /><br />\nother reforms in the \"racist<br />\nMississippi power structure.\"<br />\nDuring a march of 800 people<br />\nin Tupelo last Labor Day, 50<br />\nKlansmen with guns attempted<br />\nto intimidate the demonstrators.<br />\nUnited League members have<br />\noften been legally and physically<br />\nharrassed by Klansmen and<br />\npoliticians during campaigns<br />\nthere.<br />\nMyers emphasized that the<br />\nKlansmen in Tupelo are not just<br />\npoor backward whites. They<br />\ninclude the principal of Tupelo<br />\nPublic High School, prominent<br />\nbusinessmen and policemen , he<br />\nsaid. \"A Black goes.to court to a<br />\njudge in a black robe, \"he said<br />\n,\"who was .the night before<br />\ndecked out in a white robe.\" He<br />\nstressed that racial problems are<br />\nnot unique to Mississsippi.<br />\n\"South in this country is<br />\nanything south of the Canadian<br />\nborder.\" He noted that there has<br />\nbeen no \"massive outcry\" against<br />\na resurgence of KKK activity<br />\nthroughout the country.<br />\nAll the United League speakers<br />\nat the meeting said the United<br />\nLeague movement is not simply<br />\nin the interest of blacks, but also<br />\nseeks to help the poor and<br />\npowerless throughout the United<br />\nStates fight the political and<br />\neconomic elites\u2022of the country.<br />\nMr. McCann said that from<br />\npre-Civil War times to the present<br />\nSouthern power elites have used<br />\nblacks as scapegoats to appease<br />\npoor whites. Klan leaders \"take<br />\nthe disillusionment that many<br />\nworkers feel and channel it in a<br /><br />\nnegative direction.\"<br />\nMyers said he would like to see<br />\nall poor people united. \"In the<br />\nnext ten years there will be<br />\nmassive protests of unemployed<br />\nand ieconomically exploited<br />\nworkers. . . We would like to see<br />\na. fight representing both blacks<br />\nand whites.\" One major obstacle<br />\nto freedom for the poor that all<br />\nspeakers recognized is American<br />\nbig business. Many U.S.<br />\ncompanies have located plants in<br />\nthe South to profit from the low<br />\nwages blacks recieve because of<br />\nracial discrimination, Myers<br />\nclaimed.<br />\nHe said formal legal channels<br />\ncannot solve these problems.<br />\n\"Most of the civil rights legal<br />\nbattles won in the past 20 years<br />\nwere won because people \u2022took<br />\nto the streets.\" Myers, who is<br />\nblack, said he is dedicated to the<br />\nUnited league because he realizes<br />\n\"it was because of the United<br />\nLeague and similar organizations<br />\nin the 1960's that I was able to go<br />\nto Law School.\" He thinks the<br />\nrole of lawyers in the civil rights<br />\nmovement is important because<br />\n\"there are too many lawyers just<br />\ninterested in making money and<br />\nestablishing the status quo.

Already I can hear those<br />\nformaldehyded-breathed biologists preach that nostalgia is<br />\nsymptomatic of an organic weakness, an unnecessary<br />\nregression; nostalgia simply is not efficient. However, here<br />\non the steamy plains of central Jersey, unleashed from my<br />\nofficial academic and intellectual standing, I am giddy<br />\nwith the freedom that allows me the simple pleasure of a<br />\nsimple movie musical such as Grecs(' At college, of<br />\ncourse, I could never confess enjoyment of such fluff in<br />\nfear of the inevitable ridicule and retribution my<br />\nsomewhat snobbish and worthless colleagues would heap<br />\nupon my already overburdened soft shoulders. In short, I<br />\nam liberated.<br /><br />\nI may be mistaken, but I think New Jersey is part of<br />\nwhat every generation of collegiate malcontents calls<br />\n\"The Real World.\" Admittedly the mere mention of New<br />\nJersey elicits more groans than hosannas. Naysayers who<br />\nconfine their forays into the wilderness of Jersey to a<br />\nspeedy death-defying jaunt on the Turnpike often curse<br />\nthe state as \"The Scrotum of America.\" Such a hideous<br />\nappellation, I daresay, does have a hint of validity; like a<br />\nscrotum, that part of Jersey is smelly and aesthetically<br />\ndisgusting, yet it produces goods essential for the survival<br />\nof the species. Indeed, outside that narrow asphalt strip,<br />\nNew Jersey reveals, pardon the expression, its \"grab bag\"<br />\nnature. In the hinterlands you can still experience the<br />\nrustic fertility that gave birth to Jersey's dubious<br />\nnickname, \"The Garden State.\" Gently rolling hills,<br />\nspeckled with dairy cows, gradually give way to the<br />\ntremendous truck farms of the Piedmont plain, which<br />\nthen quietly dissolves into the magnificent de&amp;oiation of<br />\nthe Pine Barrens. And then there are the cities with names<br />\nas ugly as their appearance\u2014Hackensack, Seacaucus,<br />\nBayonne, etc--innocent victims of a culture and economy<br />\nthat has left for the supposed utopia of greener suburban<br />\npastures. Deserted dirty streets wind their way through<br />\nthe inescapable maze of blue collar ghettos, the once gold<br />\npaved boulevards that beckoned those of the Old Country<br />\nwith dreams of riches and delirious freedom. Between<br />\nthe boondocks and the ghost cities is the ersatz paradise<br />\nof bourgeois blight: irregular rows of split-level tenements<br />\nstretching to the far horizons. The hip and hypocritical<br />\nvalues, the squandering of wealth, the rising rates of<br />\njuvenile delinquency, alcoholism and drug abuse are all<br />\nkey components of the middle class muddle, and<br />\nsomehow this manages to pass as \"the good life.\" If<br />\nanything derserves the laughable title of \"The Real<br />\nWorld,\" then it is surely all of this, the crucible of<br />\nmankind that is New Jersey.<br />\nMy own part of Jersey is a confusing fusion of these<br />\ndisparate and desparate elements. Equidistant between<br />\nNew York and Philedelphia, the dateline of this essay is<br />\nwithin an easy ten-minute drive of this sociological<br />\nsmorgasboard of cities, suburbs, farms, and the grand<br />\ncountry estates of Cyrus Vance and Jackie Onassis.<br />\nPersonally, I have had contact with the first three; the la\"st<br />\nare rich enough to buy their segregation from us common<br />\nfolk. Because of this diversity it is extremely difficult, if<br />\nnot impossible, to communicate the essence of the place.<br /><br />\nTake, for example, the case history of one Joe D'Angelo,<br />\nsecond generation shift worker at American Dyes in<br />\nBound Brook. In his wallet he carries his kids' college<br />\ntranscripts; and later he tells you how the V.F.W. Hall was<br />\nfestooned with twisted crepe paper for his daughter's<br />\nreception and the band played the type of music you can<br />\ndance close to, not that dumb long hair stuff you can't<br />\nunderstand; and how, after the honeymoon, she blushed<br />\nwhen she told him about the mirrored ceiling and the<br />\nheart-shaped bathtub in their Poconos honeymoon haven;<br />\nand how at that moment he knew that she would always<br />\nbe Daddy's Little Girl.<br />\nYes, the area is both tough and grossly sentimental.<br />\nNobody likes Springsteen because his songs are too close<br />\nto the truth for comfort;girls really do comb their hair in<br />\nrear view mirrors and boys really do try to look so hard.<br />\nThere is scarcely a country roadside that is not littered<br />\nwith the remnants of clandestine beer busts. Everyone is<br />\ncareful not to mention the prevalence of so-called \"shot<br />\nglass\" babies who were conceived in the haze of a<br />\nmidnight bout with the spirits in the night.<br />\nHomosexuality is a disease one contacts in any men's<br />\nroom in New York. Without a doubt, the social graces<br />\ntake a licking here. My formal (and only)introduction to<br />\nthe world of dance was a brief two-day sojourn from the<br />\nrigors of gym class in which the girls' phys-ed teacher,<br />\nWilma Kruetzer, barked the beat of a ridiculously clumsy<br />\nbox step as if we were doing squat thrusts. In fancy<br />\nrestaurants neighbors complain that there aren't enough<br />\njours in their soup d'jour. A neighbor proclaims that<br />\nMonte Carlo is nothing special, \"the Asbury Park of the<br />\nMediterranean.\" My great uncle was a member of the<br />\nlocal Ku Klux Klan; they used to meet down at the house<br />\non the corner, but because there<br />\nwas no one to<br />\npersecute (hell, it's 1978 and still no Jews live in town<br />\nand if a black should ever move in, well, that'll be the<br />\nday) so they disintegrated into a midnight riding social<br />\nclub that sought vengeance on assorted moral offenders,<br />\nadulterers and the like. So, by blood and breed I was born<br />\na cretin, just a simple country boy, and hopefully, after<br />\nsixteen years of rugged self-discipline and unfaltering<br />\nhomage and worship of all things intellectual, bad and<br />\nbeautiful, hopefully I have been able to raise myself from<br />\nthis quagmire of life's dimmer side. Only the future, I'm<br />\nafraid, will tell whether I've succeeded.<br />\nBy now the clever among you must be wondering why<br />\nI am back here if life in these parts is as terrible as it<br />\nseems. Well, I hate to use the talk show phrase, but I need<br />\nthe time to get my act together. The frantic pace of<br />\ncontemporary life, especially that initial onrush of reality<br />\njust after graduation, precludes the opportunity for a<br />\nreasonable period of personal introspection and<br />\nmeditation in which one can create a workable model of<br />\nThe Real World. Too many lives and talents have been<br />\nwasted by the gratuitous whimsies of late adolescent<br />\nimpatience. Already two of my friends have dropped out<br />\nof law school to become, respectively, a cab driver and a<br />\nmessenger in a brokerage house, and yet a third plans to<br />\ndrop out of a prestigious graduate program to become, of<br />\nall things, a tatoo artist. External circumstances have<br />\nalways forced recent graduates to blunder into hasty<br />\ndecisions that are, at best, little more than perilous<br />\ngambles. Yet not many of us realize that we can decide<br />\nnot to decide-- that is, to possess a certain magnitude of<br />\nself-awareness to allow the invirulent honesty to admit we<br />\ntruly do not know what to do. Indecision and restlessness<br />\nare nothing to be ashamed of; indeed, they are hallmarks<br />\nof the quanderous condition of modern man in a society<br />\nwhere the individual's power of self-determination is<br />\nsharply checked. For a person who has been safely<br />\nentombed in the prosaic order of educational institutions,<br />\nthe sudden emergence into the complex, seemingly<br />\nchaotic reality of the outside world can be a traumatic<br />\nevent to the umpteenth degree. The best advice (and,<br />\nincidentally, the justification for my present idolatry) is<br />\nto relax and take all the time you need to decide the<br />\nn'ature of your life after your undergraduate days. After<br />\nall, your decision very well may decide the course of the<br />\nrest of your life.<br />\nThe trick of this process lies in developing a precise<br />\ndetermination of The Real World. For some among us,<br />\nthose poor misguided souls contemplating a career in<br />\nacademics, the college campus is indeed The Real World.<br />\nAt onetime, I must admit, the peaceful pace of academics<br />\nwith its ample rewards for just plain thought beckoned<br />\nthis rather callow young man who looks good in tweed<br />\njackets with elbow patches. Back to the point,The Real<br />\nWorld is only that physical and metaphysical part of the<br />\nplanet we choose to deem as such. Of course this is not as<br />\nsimple as it sounds. It has, I imagine, something to do<br />\nwith seeing yourself in the third person, and placing that<br />\nthird person into its proper position in your self-styled<br />\nidea of reality. In other words, you must see yourself as<br />\nthat essential piece of jigsaw that completes the picture.<br />\nTwo examples will hopefully clarify the concept.<br />\nSteven S. could not remember a time when he did not<br />\nwant to become a lawyer. Like a religious fanatic, Steven<br />\nplotted his youth with the sole goal of achieving Nirvana:<br />\ni.e. a prestigious east coast law school. Every<br /><br />\nex<br />\nhe<br />\ntir<br />\nev<br /><br />\nGc<br /><br />\nextracurricular activity was evaluated in terms of whether<br />\nhe could snare an office or title to sweeten his record. At<br />\ntimes poor Steven would be seized by spurts of paranoia;<br />\neven a valiant effort at creating a relationship with a<br />\nGoucher siren ended in a bog of misunderstood intentions<br /><br />\nand doubt. He chewed his fingernails down to nubs in<br />\nearning his 4.0 from Hopkins, and happily, he was<br />\nadmitted into Georgetown where, my sources tell me, he's<br />\nas happy as a lark.<br />\nNot so happy, however, is my tatoo artist friend, Larry<br />\nH. Throughout his undergraduate days at Rutgers, Larry<br />\nwas known more for his cartoons and caricatures than his<br />\ndeep and abiding interest in Estonia. To most of his<br />\nfriends, Larry was an enigma, someone who preferred to<br />\nsit back in the corner and watch the world go by,<br />\npatiently waiting and not really caring if his pipe ever<br />\nmade its way back to him. He never burdened himself<br />\nupon others; quiet as a clam, his occasional outbursts of<br />\nvitrolic cynicism only belied his personal insecurity. When<br />\nfriends chipped in for a bottle of fine whiskey to<br />\ncelebrate his acceptance into grad school, Larry was<br />\nembarrassed by his lack- of enthusiasm over what<br />\neverybody else thought was a great achievement. After all,<br />\ngrad school and the prospect of an advanced degree<br />\noffered an assurance of stability that the art world, by its<br />\nnature, never has. So, reluctantly, he shuffled off to the<br />\nbig city and soon, depressed by the boredom, found<br />\nhimself taking long mournful walks. On one of these<br />\nwalks he happened to notice a window sign advertising a<br />\njob \u2022 that seemed interesting, and now he plans to quit<br />\nschool in December.His portfolio has been subsequently<br />\nincreased by part time work as a designer of tattoos and<br />\nt-shirts in a Times Square arcade.<br />\nSuch happy endings, I am told, happen all the time. An<br />\nanthropology professor at Hopkins used to reassure his<br />\nbeleagured students that no matter how poor or desperate<br />\nthe living conditions, man would somehow find the way<br />\nto \"muddle through.\" And it is with that same sense of<br />\nforlorn optimism that the recent graduate approaches the<br />\nchallenges of The Real World. But one can only succeed<br />\nby possessing an unflagging belief in what you want to do.<br />\nThe roadblocks Larry H. constructed to barricade himself<br />\nfrom what he was taught by a society obsessed with<br />\naffluence and which considers art as a non-profitable,<br />\nnon-marketable talent, have been torn down by a<br />\ntremendous and glorious act of self-realization. It's useless<br />\nhere to add the cliche that happiness and personal status<br />\ncannot be measured -in terms of tangible values. Instead, I<br />\noffer now, in fear of retribution from the more<br />\nintellectual reader, some A.E. Housman tripe on tile<br />\nsubject:<br />\nWhen I was one-and-twenty<br />\nI heard a wise man say,<br />\n\"Give crowns and pounds and guineas<br />\nBut not your heart away;<br />\nGive pearls away and rubies<br />\nBut keep your fancy free.\"<br />\nBut I was one-and-twenty,<br />\nNo use to talk to me.<br />\nWhen I was one-and-twentY<br />\nI heard him say again,<br />\n\"The heart out of the bosom<br />\nWas never given in vain;<br />\n'Tis paid with sighs a-plenty<br />\nAnd sold for endless rue.\"<br />\nAnd I am two-and-twenty,<br />\nAnd oh,'tis true,'tis true.<br /><br />\nThe price of rue on the open market being what it is, a<br />\nconstant state of self-pity is essentially worthless, both in<br />\nterms of putting vread on the table and achieving a<br />\nmodicum of self-esteem. And that is all that matters.<br />\nThe biggest psychological problem facing the recent<br />\ngraduate is the acceptance and adaptation to change.<br />\nCollege does a more than efficient job in insulating the<br />\nindividual from the proverbial winds of change. Time<br />\nexists at college only on the night before a paper is due.<br />\nOnce out of college, however, we realize somewhat slowly<br />\nthat it is not the structure of society which ahs changed<br />\nduring our four year internment, but rather its style and<br />\nsubstance. There was a time, not long ago, when I could<br />\nwalk the few streets of this village and name every family<br />\nthat lived in every house. Yet now, when I walk down to<br />\nthe post office to mail this essay, I will recognize only a<br />\nfew names, and even fewer faces. Shocked and dismayed,<br />\nI begin to wonder if the essence of the village has changed<br />\nsurreptiously during my absence. An explanation: because<br />\nwe are so amazed and bewildered by the changes in our<br />\nphysical and psychological selves, we cannot help but fail<br />\nto notice the changes in the world around us. By<br />\ndefinition, because we have changed, so has The Real<br />\nWorld. The solution, then, is to create a matrix ofinternal<br />\nand external changes upon which we can plot by<br />\ninterpolation our exact position and progress. To spout<br />\nanother cliche, only by knowing where we are, can we<br />\ndiscover where we are going. Still, this ignores what is<br />\nperhaps the most devastating non-sociological aftermath<br />\nof college. For those of us fidicuary unfortunates who<br />\nweren't able to revel in the homosexual romps and other<br />\nadvantages of New England boarding schools, college is<br />\nthe first period of lengthy separation from our parents. Of<br />\nall the elments in The Real World, our parents have<br />\nchanged the most. And whatever you may think of them,<br />\nwhether you love or loathe them, or simply see them as a<br />\nnuisance, you must painfully admit to yourself the<br />\nmorbid yet total and unrelentless truth that your parents<br /><br />\nare four years nearer to their deaths, that somehow the<br />\nroles have been reversed, and that finally, your parents<br />\nneed you more than you need them.<br />\nYou see -- I've breathed too much of this central Jersey<br />\nair that carries the germ of gross sentimentality. I am<br />\nreduced to quoting Charles Lamb:<br />\nGhost-like I paced round the haunts of my childhood,<br />\nEarth seemed a desert I was bound to traverse,<br />\nSeeking to find the old familiar faces.<br />\nUnfortunately, my present situation brings up yet another<br />\nproblem of coping with The Real World. What happens,<br />\nsay, after you've defined The Real Wrold to apparent<br />\nsatisfaction, and you duddenly discover you don't like<br />\nwaht you've created? A writer can destroy a manuscript;<br />\nHemingway reportedly threw the typescript of his first<br />\nnovel overboard on an Atlantic crossing. Doctors can bury<br />\ntheir mistakes. But we normal folk can not discard a<br />\nsegment of a life or right a wrong that has long since<br />\ndisappeared. The Real World here in New Jersey, sad to<br />\nsay, is quite disappointing. The job situation is woefully<br />\ninadequate; the pervading mental depression seems to<br />\nhave overlapped into the economy. The once pastoral<br />\nvistas of cut cornfields and snaking snow fence are now<br />\nspoiled by the insidious encroachment of suburban<br />\nbanality. The air is not as clear as it used to be, and every<br />\nnight another star fades into the ersatz glow of artificial<br />\nlight. The familiar faces of friends and family have<br />\ndistorted into grotesques, and there are no Mrs.<br />\nRobinsons to service the recent graduate. I bow to<br />\nThomas Wolfe, the man who raised nostalgia and romance<br />\nto a malignancy, who intended to use these words from<br /><br />\nWar and Peace on the title page of The Web and the<br />\nRock: \"Prince Andrei looked up at the stars and sighed;<br />\neverything was so different from what he thought it was<br />\ngoing to be.<br />\nSo, it is only with the lowered resistance of near sleep,<br />\nwhen I'm feeling lonely and beat, I drift back in time, and<br />\nI find my feet down on Charles Street.<br />\nALAS, JOHNS HOPKINS! Now I'm not suggesting that<br />\nHopkins is anysort of paradise; no... I rather think of<br />\nHopkins as a sanctuary, an intellectual retreat, a place to<br />\nthink and to get your act together. I'm sure you've all<br />\nheard stories of recently released convicts who<br />\ndeliberately break their paroles just to return to jail<br />\nbecause they find the outside world unsuitable for living.<br />\nWell, needless to say, that is exactly how I feel. In my<br />\nmemories of Homewood I seek the sense of permanance<br />\nso pervasive in childhood yet so abruptly absent in young<br />\nadulthood. I entered college a child and exited a<br />\nman-child; I scratch the surface of reminiscence to<br />\nuncover what might be clues to my present identity. But I<br />\ndo not need to dig any deeper than a vague yet powerful<br />\nepiphany suffered on the night of graduation last May.<br />\nThe upper quad was transformed into a vignette of a<br />\nbygone day, a scene out of a Booth Tarkington novel or a<br />\nGordon McRae musical. Under the big top of the tent,<br />\ntables and chairs had been unfolded on a wooden dance<br />\nfloor laid just for the occasion. The breeze whispered<br />\nmagic, while guys sweated in itchy monkey suits and girls<br />\nsqueezed into chiffon bodices left over from an<br />\nassortment of proms and cotillons. Couples swinged and<br />\nswayed to the lilting strains of the Bing Miller orchestra.<br />\nOh how that crooner made us swoon. I tried my<br />\ndamnedest to guide my well-bred partner around the<br />\nswirling vortexes of couples on the dance floor, but not<br />\nhaving the training of a bon vivant or the bark of Wilma<br />\nKruetzer to command, I lost both the time and beat, and<br />\nsoon we both tired of my spastic lurch. But, before we<br />\nretired from the dance floor for the pleasures of Cold<br />\nDuck and the flesh, I espied out of the corner of my eye a<br />\npicture of an aging professor dancing rather proudly and<br />\nelegantly with his wife. This bulbous professor known<br />\nbest for his gut--both his stomach and his course-- was, at<br />\nthe beginning of that last semester, the subject of our<br />\nridicule for his religious devotion to his study of the<br />\nsimplest things in nature. At first I laughed too, but as the<br />\nsemester lost ground, I soon gained a certain respect for<br />\nthis man with his bolo ties and stale jokes. Of all my<br />\nprofessors at Hopkins, he showed the most unabashed,<br />\nunashamed enthusiasm for the subject matter, and I.<br />\nsuspect he was one of the few, if not the only one, to<br />\nreally give a damn whether we learned. To be perfectly<br />\nhonest, I envied his contentment, his happiness, and I felt<br />\nsorry for him when jocks would sneak out of the class<br />\nwhile his back was turned. His trust in us was never<br />\nreciprocated. And here I was sharing the same (lance floor<br />\nwith him. This struck me as being terribly wrong. I had no<br />\nright to share the floor with him. I was a fraud; I had<br />\nflim-flammed my way through college, and here I was an<br />\naccepted participant in a ceremony that portended to be<br />\nan initiation into a higher place of existence, as if my<br />\ncollege diploma was a membership card to an informal<br />\nclub of elites. in essence, I was a gate crasher. As we were<br />\nleaving, a weight heavier than my girlfriend's head fell<br />\nupon my shoulder; I looked back at the scene and<br />\nsuddenly realized that the game was over. Hopkins and I<br />\nhad fought to a draw; if I had won this match, I would've<br />\nadvanced to the higher sea of graduate school. But my<br />\ndays of formal learning had been ended by this stalemate,<br />\nand it was time to say goodbye and to punish myself for<br />\nall the mistakes I had made. From out of nowhere for no<br />\nco t.proanyep.r flo4r.<br />\ngood reason popped into my mind Fritz Pens'<br />\nwayward Gestalt victims:<br />\nWelcome to The Real World, Mr. Graduate!<br />\nJump on in! We've been expecting you!<br />\nJust strip down, bend over, and the fun can begin...<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022:r \u2022'!'POIT<br /><br />\nPAdViVCNOVEMBER'17,\"197g<br /><br />\nCHUTE rim, ASK QUESTIOlt LATER<br />\nBY MARC NASDOR<br />\nThe tiny airplane, a DeHavilland Beaver, taxied to the<br />\nfar end of the grass runway. Into a compartment about<br />\nthe size of a Volkswagen, nine human beings were<br />\ncrammed into fetal positions. The pilot was awaiting the<br />\nsignal to take off, and when everything was all clear, we<br />\nbolted down the runway, taking off and ascending toward<br />\nthe thin clouds and blue sky behind them. The back of<br />\nmy neck tightened, bones shook and joints creaked. I<br />\ntook a deep breath and let out a sigh. The jumpmaster<br />\nplaced the first man in position by the open door. My left<br />\nhand clutched the reserve chute clipped to the harness on<br />\nmy stomach. I was to be number three.<br />\n\"Yes, there is the possibility of getting killed; but<br />\nlisten, more people by percentage have died on the golf<br />\ncourses,\" the burly gentleman at the front of the<br />\nclassroom reassured us. I let out a nervous chuckle.<br />\nHmmm...killed. Well, at least I wouldn't have to pay any<br />\nmore rent tp that money-grubbing landlord of mine. Then<br />\nI thought, \"Hey man, this is serious business, not King's<br />\nDominion. Do you have any idea what you're doing?\"<br />\nThe door to the classroom was open. Yes, it would be so<br />\neasy, just get up and run back to the car, to safety. A<br />\nlittle devil materialized on my shoulder. \"That's right,<br />\nwhy don't you run back to the car, you lunchmeat. Have<br />\nyou ever heard the sound of thirty-five people laughing<br />\ntheir heads off? They'll be laughing at you, at YOU!\" His<br />\ncounterpart appeared on my other shoulder, dressed in a<br />\nwhite toga. \"What will your grandmother say? Your poor<br />\nmother, being consoled by the funeral directors as the<br />\nhearse moves slowly toward the cemetary, it'll break her<br />\nheart.\" Then another thought occurred to me. I had just<br />\nshelled out thirty-five beans to take this class. After a few<br />\nseconds of thought, I succumbed to the fiscal persuasion.<br />\nIt was now or never.<br />\nActually, there was a certain excitement to it. I had<br />\nwanted to do this for over a year and had kept putting it<br />\noff. Was this to be the ultimate liberating experience, or<br />\nmerely an exprezion of my pronounced seif-destructive<br />\ntendencies? At that point I didn't seem to care. \"Just get<br />\nit over with!\"<br />\nThe first five hours of the instruction were spent in<br />\nthe classroom, learning about aerodynamics, equipment,<br />\nform, and emergency procedure. Five hours may seem<br />\nlike a lot of time to listen to one person speak, but when<br />\nyour life depends upon it, you listen. The aerodynamics<br />\nwere not all that complicated, simple enough for someone<br />\nlike myself who has never taken a science course at<br />\nHopkins. Basically, we were told how the parachute<br />\nworks. \"No, the landing force is not equivalent to<br />\njumping off a ten-story building. Relax.\" Most of the air<br />\npressure in an inflated, falling parachute is applied<br />\ndirectly to the top half of the canopy. Human body-sized<br />\n\"windows\"; were cut out of the sides of these particular<br />\nchutes to facilitate a primitive steering mechanism;<br />\nhowever, from,the \"low\" altitude of three thousand feet,<br />\naccording to the calculations made by the pilot, no matter<br />\nwhich way we steered, we would eventually land<br />\nsomewhere near the target spot. Looking at the map of<br />\nthe area taken from the height at which we were to jump,<br />\nI hoped that \"somewhere near\" didn't mean the trees or<br />\nthe electric wires. I guessed I would have to take my<br />\nchances.<br />\nThe equipment seemed excellent. The instructor<br />\nclaimed that these parachutes have only failed in one out<br />\nof five hundred thousand jumps.(Why the hell is he giving<br />\nus old equipment?) He corrected himself, reassuring us<br />\nthat they really weren't that old. Step by step he went<br />\nover the mechanics of the packs, the parachutes<br />\nthemselves, and the harnesses, unraveling a chute for us to<br />\nshow exactly how the beast worked. The backuPsystem<br />\nfor the reserve canopy was amazing; even if a person was<br />\nto black out while falling, in the event that the main<br />\ncanopy should fail, an electronic device would<br />\nautomatically eject the reserve when, at full velocity, the<br />\nbody fell to an altitude of one thousand feet. My wits<br />\ngradually came together.<br />\nThe next part of the class was concerned with form<br />\nand style when exiting from the aircraft and when<br />\nlanding. All I wanted to do was make sure I hit the Earth<br />\nand not the Moon. We were told that it was necessary for<br />\nthe safe operation of the parachute, that when leaving the<br />\nplane we should be spread-eagled and arched all the way<br />\nback, so that we would be falling stomach-down. Also, we<br />\nwere to count to seven as loud as we possibly could, and<br />\nby then the canopy would be completely open. Sure it<br />\nwould! We practiced for a while,jumping out of the door<br />\nof the plane while it was still on the ground. Finally he<br />\nshowed us how to land. The instructor claimed that the<br />\nlanding would be very soft, IF done correctly. He<br />\ndemonstrated how to fall and the class practiced for<br /><br />\nabout a half hour.<br />\nThere was still one hope. It had been drizzling all<br />\nmorning and we were told that there was a possibility that<br />\nwe would not be able to jump that day. So much for good<br />\nluck--the clouds somehow managed to vanish exactly at<br />\nthe moment the class ended. Maybe it would get dark and<br />\nmy turn wouldn't come up. Then the person at the front<br />\ndesk read the order in which we were to jump. Oh Christ.<br />\nI was to be in the first load. I numbly suited up: white<br />\njump suit, boots, and crash helmet. The words \"crash.<br />\ncrash, CRASH\" echoed between my ears. My mind was in<br />\na semi-stupor as the instructor tightened the harness<br />\naround my shoulders and between my legs. No getting out<br />\nof it now. The packs were heavy and a bit uncomfortable,<br />\nbut that was the last thing on my mind. Waiting for the<br />\nairplane to arrive, I stood around with my<br />\ncomrades-in-death and discussed exit procedure. I should<br />\nhave been thinking about philosophy, or maybe sex,<br />\ndrugs, and rock and roll. It was impossible, as the Chariot<br /><br />\nmetal insect, I felt no sensation of falling. I was thrown<br />\nout into the void and the plane went up. Time and space<br />\nseemed relative to my state of mind. I didn't black out;<br />\nrather, I blanked out for a split second. I wasn't positive<br />\nwhere I was, but all my fears suddenly left-me as I felt the<br />\ntug at my shoulders, signifying the opening of the blessed<br />\ncanopy. I looked up and everything was fine. It was the<br />\nbest rush I ever had. Since I was traveling with the wind,<br />\neverything was dead quiet for miles around, and I was<br />\nelated. As I approached the ground, I could hear one of<br />\nthe instructors calling out directions to me over a<br />\nloudspeaker. Radar would have been more helpful, but<br />\nthis was better than nothing. I landed softly in a field<br />\nabout fifty yards from the target. For the next hour, it<br />\nwas impossible to wipe the grin from my face. The feeling<br />\nof accomplishment was incredible; I felt that I had<br />\ncomplete control of my destiny. The feeling never left.<br />\nAfter everyone had jumped, the jumpmaster came<br />\nover to critique our performance. I got a perfect score,<br />\nnaturally. After going through hundreds of<br />\ncongratulations, we packed up and headed home.<br />\nNow I have a problem. I have become obsessed with<br />\nthe sport. I'm trying to save every penny because I plan to<br />\njump again over Thanksgiving. As far as I'm concerned,<br />\nthere's no getting away from it. I recommend parachuting<br />\nto anyone in reasonably good shape, regardless of sex or<br />\nbody build. You will never regret it. Its therapeutic value<br />\noutdoes a thousand psychiatrists. Let your adventurous<br />\nspirit carry you to its limitless boundaries. All you have to<br />\ndo is say \"yes.\"<br />\nFor those interested in taking up this sport, or at<br />\nleast trying it once, the Pelican Sport Parachuting Center<br />\nis located in Ridgely, Maryland on the Eastern Shore,<br />\nabout twenty minutes on the other side of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay Bridge.

When people ask about my<br />\ncollege career, I reply, quite candidly, I wasted the<br />\nopportunity. I had failed to achieve what I really<br />\nwanted--a good enough record to force my way into a<br />\nclinical psychology program. I realize that I am the only<br />\none to blame. In fact, my years at Hopkins were the best<br />\nyears of my life. So, when I do remember Hopkins, and I<br />\ndo most every day, my mind returns to that final vision of<br />\nthe professor and his wife, and my eyes inevitably tear, as<br />\nmuch in pleasure, and in pain.<br />\nAn unfortunate skydiver finds himself up a tree.<br />\nof Doom had just landed on the runway, and was now<br />\nslowly ambling its way toward us like a flying monster<br />\nout of a Japanese science fiction movie. One by one, we<br />\nclimbed into the monster's side and squished ourselves<br />\ninto its belly.<br />\nThree thousand feet above the ground, the earth<br />\nlooked like the typical patchwork quilt one would expect<br />\nto see; but I wouldn't know, since my own eyes were<br />\nslammed shut. With some work I pried them open, only,<br />\nto see the first man sitting right on the doorway, half in<br />\nhalf out. The plane was noisy and I couldn't hear what<br />\nanyone was saying. The jumpmaster placed his hand.<br />\nunder the initial victim's right buttock and shoved him<br />\nout into oblivion. I prayed to my guardian angel for help,<br />\nand he was<br />\nbut I had forgotten that this was his week<br />\nstill vacationing in Trinidad.

Who me?\" He<br />\nmotioned for me to put my legs out the door and<br />\nattached my static line to the plane, which would open<br />\nthe chute automatically. Without thinking, I did as he<br />\ncommanded. The force of the wind was overwhelming; I<br />\ncould hardly keep myself from being blown back into the<br />\nplane. \"ARE YOU READY?\" he screamed. \"YES\" I<br />\nscreamed back. I wasn't going to let him push me. I had<br />\ngotten this far and if I was going to do it, I was going to<br />\ndo it. \"GO!\" he shouted.<br />\nWhat was the feeling like?

Greek tragedy<br />\nin which Medea, in revenge for being betrayed by her<br />\nhusband Jason (of the Golden Fleece)imurdeis their three<br />\nchildren. Psychologists tell us that our strongest instinct,<br />\nbeyond the sex drive, beyond the need for food, is the<br />\nmaternal bond\u201e the love of a mother for her offspring.<br />\nInfanticide is the most heinous crime we have; it violates<br />\nour most inviolable trust. It is worsened when the child is<br />\ntotally innbcent of any crime, and multiplied beyond<br />\nreality when there are three innocent children. Can our<br />\nmodern day sensibilities comprehend this crime, or are<br />\nthe classic plots too distant, too primordial, for our jaded<br />\nsenses?<br />\nDirector Jules Dassm recaptures the majesty of the<br />\nclassics in a relevant form in his most recent film, A<br />\nDream of Passion. It is the story of an aging, Greek-born<br />\nactress, Maya (Melinda Mercouri) who returns home to<br />\nAthens in the waning days of her Hollywood film career.<br />\nShe had made it in Hollywood when there was avogue for<br />\nexotic, well-built foreign-accented beauties (Loren,<br />\nCardinale, Lollabridgida). Now, her face and body are<br />\nbeginning to sag, and she is rejected by the merciless eye<br />\nof the camera.<br />\nShe comes home to rediscover her roots, and a husband<br />\nthat she has left behind. She comes home to rediscover<br />\nher art, the classic power of an actress to express our<br />\ndeepest emotions. And she comes home to assess the life<br />\nshe has lived--the life of a modern day woman slightly<br />\nhyperbolized by the hectic paced, bizarre world of<br />\nHollywood.<br />\nShe is to star in The Medea, which is being produced<br />\nboth in Classical Greek for the Athenian outdoor stage<br />\nand in English for a BBC-production pf a show called<br />\n\"The Creative Process.\" Both are being directed by her<br />\nformer lover, Costa (Jules Dassin), who has very firm<br />\ninterpretive ideas about the play. He wants to recapture<br />\nits miginal mystery, its witchcraft. Above all, he wants to<br />\nkeep it free from any note of.today's \"feminist bullshit.\"<br />\nAs a publicity stunt to promote the production and<br />\nMaya's sagging career, someone discohters that there is a<br />\npresent day Medea in jail in Athens for murdering her<br />\nthree children in a jealous rage over her husband's<br />\ninfidelity. We indeed have modern day tragic heroes and<br />\nrl up in our jails and asylums and<br />\nheroines, they are It<br />\nare labeled insane.<br />\nMaya arranges to meet Brenda (Ellen Burstyn), the<br />\nMedea of Golthi, and she brings a team of photographers<br /><br />\nMadman and the Nun<br />\nA<br /><br />\nDream of Passion<br /><br />\nand journalists, to film \"the meeting of the two Medeas.\"<br />\nFor one tender moment while the journalists wait behind<br />\na closed door, they talk behind the bars of the prison<br />\nconference room. \"Thank you for coming. I hardly get<br />\nany visitors.\" The door explodes and photographers and<br />\njournalists burst through in a disgusting orgy of flashing<br />\ncameras. The meeting is violated. It is one of the most<br />\nshocking scenes I have ever witnessed.<br />\nThus begins the relationship which guides the rest of<br />\nthe movie. Maya is possessed by guilt over her abhorrent<br />\nact and it provokes a crisis in her life. She creeps guiltily<br />\nback to the prison, bearing flowers and Brenda agrees to<br />\nsee her. She discovrrs in Brenda not only a real life model<br />\nfor her role, as Medea, but in a strange way a paradigm for<br />\nthe sojourn of a modern woman. She also finds a friend.<br />\nBurstyn is superb in this delicate role. She ranges<br />\nbetween the calm and conversational, but not quite ever<br />\nwholly sane, and the burning, violent, ecstatic rage of a<br />\nwoman still capable of slaughtering her children again.<br />\nThe director leaVes no doubt that we are dealing with a<br />\ndangerously insane psychopath, and not a modern<br />\nheroine. Yet in a curious way she represents the plight of<br />\nthe modern woman, both as victim and as criminal.<br />\nThis is what Maya perceives, the link between her own<br />\nexperiences and those of this pathetic murderess. Maya<br />\ncan find that one infinitesimal kernal of justification for<br />\nBrenda's act, her absolute outrage at being betrayed.<br />\nPerhaps it really is understandable so long as it happens<br />\nonly once in two thousand years, expressing the<br />\ncumulated rage of all womankind.<br />\nMercouri as Maya is at her finest. She has fully<br />\ntranscended the stereotyPed sex-goddess role, and has<br /><br />\njibiqtertaimept<br /><br />\nWelles<br /><br />\nWar has been depicted in many different lights. It can<br />\nexpose a tragic side of human nature and an heroic side; a<br />\nhorrible side and even an absurd side. The problem for the<br />\nmoviemakers has remained, however, how to portray war<br />\nin an outrightly funny way, without having it lapse into<br />\nbanality a la Hogan 's Heroes. King of Hearts, a comical<br />\naccount of one of the unforseen effects of war, is able to<br />\ndo just this and yet still furnish the viewer with a clear<br />\nand significant message.<br />\nKing of Hearts is set in World War 1 France The<br />\nGermans are planning to blow up a town on the other 'side<br />\nof the river and the English are intent on stopping them.<br />\nHow to accomplish this? Well, the first step is to find an<br />\nexpert on bombs who speaks perfect French. Once in<br />\ntown, maybe he will be able to deactivate the explosives.<br />\nThe only catch is that there is no French-speaking bomb<br />\nexpert. in the Oritish garrison, so the Colonel must settle<br />\nfor the next best thing--a French-speaking bird expert. Of<br />\ncourse, Private Plumpick has no idea of what he is doing,<br />\nand upon arrival he encounters some Gerpan soldiers and<br />\nhides in an insane asylum. The basic premise of the movie<br />\nis that Plumpick unwittingly releases all the inmates, who<br />\nthen take over the now-evacuated town. They begin to<br />\nassume all sorts of pretend roles, and set up their 'own<br />\nplay \"kingdom.\" The title of the film comes about<br />\nbecausc the hapless Plumpick is named the King of Hearts<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nfi<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nby 14 4.1<br />\nDavid<br />\nKaplan<br /><br />\nThe<br />\nAbsurd<br />\nLight of<br />\nar<br /><br />\n-4 I<br />\ndespite his warnings and protestations.<br />\nThere is a lot of humorous material in this situation W<br />\nexploit, and Director Phillippe de Broca exploits it with<br />\ndeftness and skill. Much of the material reminded me of.<br />\nsome of the things done in Monty Python, and indeed the \u2022<br />\nhumor can be very broad and very hilarious. All<br />\ncharacters are played in a comic style and the entire<br />\nsituation is absurd from the outset. It is very easy to<br />\nsimply have a good time watching the movie without<br />\nderiving any additional illumination.<br />\nBut the message is clearly there. King of Hearts is<br /><br />\ngrown into a fine and mature actress. Her performance is<br />\nstrong and resonant, and she is playing a character that so<br />\nclosely parallels herself that it is clear that Maya is based<br />\non Mereouri's biography. Indeed, the Greek version of<br />\nThe Medea that we witness in the film actually took<br />\nplace, as an outdoor play starring Mercouri in Athens.<br />\nAlso, Jules Dassin, the directorond Mercouri are husband<br />\nand wife.<br />\nThe film is well made and balanced. There is no<br />\nattempt to create a false air of mystery by engulfing this<br />\nfilip in dark shadows. Everything is filmed<br />\nstraightforwardly in clear light. Dark moodiness is<br />\nreserved for the places where it belongs--in the sequences<br />\nthat show the actual production of The Medea.<br />\nMaya uses her conversations with Brenda to grow in her<br />\nrole as Medea, and we witness the growing pains qf the<br />\ncreative process. At the same time she is reaching the<br />\nheight of her creative powers, she is coming to terms with<br />\nher own life. The film climaxes in \u2018,a sequence in which<br />\nMaya delineates the real parallels between her life and<br />\nBrenda's\u2014it is a story of the tawdriness of her climb to<br />\nfame, of her betrayals and self-degradation.<br />\nThis is a thoroughly engrossing film. Its one flaw is tha':<br />\nthe director too slavishly follows the techniques of his<br />\nacknowledged mentor, Ingmar Bergman. One sequence, in<br />\nwhich everyone is sitting around a clip of Liv Ullman<br />\nfrom Persona which closely parallels the main theme of<br />\nthe film, is nothing more than homage from student to<br />\nteacher. It should have been edited out. On the whole,<br />\nthough, A Dream of d'assion is a film that should not be<br />\nmissed.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nPresentation Hail<br />\nThe Wild Geese Mary Avnrt<br /><br />\n41<br /><br />\ndefinitely an anti-war film and de Broca has a lot to say,<br />\nespecially when one considers that it was made in 1967.<br />\nAs the movie proceeds, and as,both the \"lunatics\" and the<br />\nsoldiers are represented, it becomes obvious that the<br />\nsoldiers are. the true lunatics and that the inmates have<br />\nmore real sanity than the outside world. In the pretend<br />\n\"kingdom,\" there is indeed madness, but there is a kind<br />\nof method in the madness. The play world possesses a<br />\ncertain sobriety which the \"real\" world does not. Both<br />\ngroups are playing games, bu' the inmates at leas i play<br />\ngames which are harmless, and they wish them to remain<br />\nthat way. When Plumpick tries to lead them out of town,<br />\nthey hear the sounds of the artillery and refuse -to<br />\ncontinue, shouting, \"there are wild beasts out theit!\" One<br />\ncan easily see the wisdom of their decision--it is better to<br />\nlive in a world of illusion than in a world of terrifying<br />\nabsurdity.<br />\nKing of Hearts has become something of a cult,film,<br />\nand it is possible to see why. A film which is both as<br />\nfunny and as serious as this one is a rare treat. De Broca<br />\ndoes a fabulous directing job, and Alan Bates sits well in<br />\nthe role of Private Plumpick. However, I believe that most<br />\nof the credit belongs to the minor characters, for they. in<br />\nfact make the movie. King cf Hearts will be playing in<br />\nShriver Hall on November 17th and 18th, at both 7:30<br />\n\u2022<br />\nand 10:00.<br /><br />\n\"- NEWS-MIER \"I<br /><br />\n17(<br /><br />\n'The Wild Geese'Captures African Warfare<br />\nBurton and Harris Are True Mercenaries<br />\ntime Faulkner, having made his last raid, must console the<br />\ndead Jaander's son, the hardened old soldier has truly and<br />\npoignantly softened.<br />\nRoger Moore is adequate as the cigar chewing Shawn<br />\nFlynn, the daredevil who can fly all planes and take all<br />\npositions without muss,ing his hair.

Andrew<br />\nMacLaglan's The Wild Geese is such a movie, and given<br />\nthe sensitivity of the subject, there are surprisingly few<br />\nshowbiz copouts. He depicts mercenaries as complex<br />\nhumans rather than fanatics or thugs, and Africa comes<br />\noff as something other than the home of Idi Amin or<br />\nDaktari.<br />\nThe plot concerns a scheme by English mining<br />\nmagnate Sir Edward Matherson (Stewart Granger) to<br />\ncontrol the huge copper resources of a central African<br />\ncountry ruled by a tin horn despot. Sir Edward must free<br />\nJulius Lumbani, the revered and soon to be wasted<br />\nindependence leader, who will supposedly start a revolt.<br />\nThe tycoon hires Allen Faulkner (Richard Burton), an<br />\nover the hill soldier of fortune, to do the job. Faulkner<br />\nand three other veterans (Richard Harris, Roger Moore,<br />\nand Hardy Kruger) train a company, free Lumbani, only<br />\nto be stranded by Matherson in the bush, with nowhere to<br />\nflee.<br />\nThe film has some surprisingly fine performances,<br />\nespecially by Harris, who deserves a good part after such<br />\nturkeys as Orca and The Cassandra Crossing. Harris is<br />\nRafer Jaanders, Faulkner's old comrade in arms, and a<br />\ncrack planner. Jaanders only agrees to leave his<br />\ncomfortable English home and his lovely son because he<br />\nhas always believed in Lumbani. This idealism and love<br />\nseem genuinely compatible with a commando's<br />\nruthlessness. At the end Jaanders, who has saved the unit<br />\nby leading a rear guard, cannot reach the taxiing plane, as<br />\nhe is pursued by the enemy. He asks Faulkner to kill him<br />\nso as not to be ravaged by the soldiers. Harris and Burton<br />\nare good enough actors so that this scene is not at all<br />\nh okey.<br />\nBurton's Faulkner is sympathetically ignoble, for the<br />\nmercenary admits his own responsibility for being a social<br />\nmisfit. One empathizes with the futility of his position<br />\nwhen he realizes he has been betrayed. Indeed, by the<br /><br />\nunbelieveable symbolism, Coetzee volunteers, to carry the<br />\nailing Lumbani on his back through the bush. During the'<br />\nmarch, the black and white argue politics, and the<br />\nAfrikaner addresses Lumbani as \"Kaffir\" (the South<br />\nAfrican term for nigger). Hold on now! Afrikaners simply<br />\ndon't do that. To symbolize his conversion from racism,<br />\nKruger finally calls Lumbani \"bloke.\" C'mon now! Give<br />\nthe Afrikaners a break.

It is impossible to reconcile<br />\nblack and white in Southern Africa and to trace a<br />\ncomplex mercenary operation all in two hours of film.<br />\nWhen the South African dies, the camera focuses in on<br />\nLumbani's black hand clasping Coetzee's white hand.<br />\nWhere's the violin music, boys?<br />\nDespite this mistake, the direction is otherwise<br />\nexcellent. The recruitment of the mercenaries, who join<br />\nfor every possible reason, is amusingly believable. The<br />\nbush lighting scenes have that very tense, yet 'very<br />\nsporadic, speed which characterizes that type of warfare.<br />\nHowever, the decimated unit should not slowly<br />\nretreat along a road,.it should be scattered in the bush. No<br />\nwonder it gets mauled! The opening parachute jump from<br />\nan old Dakota is as good as that in A Bridge Too Far.<br />\nThe scenery does not look like the California<br />\nMonsanto woods, for the film was shot in South Africa's<br />\nNorthern Transvaal, true bush country. Africa's terrifying<br />\nvastness, so vividly depicted, is a perfect contrast to<br />\nMatherson's insensitively plush London digs.<br />\nPerhaps the film was more meaningful for me<br />\nbecause I saw it in Pretoria three days after its<br />\nJohannesburg world premiere last summer.

The Madman and the Nun,<br />\nwritten in 1923 by the Polish playwright Stanislaw<br />\nWitkiewicz and currently produced by the Barnstormers,<br />\nis sadly outdated.<br />\nThe theme is typical: madmen are saner than their<br />\nkeepers. This theme was better done in The King of<br />\nHearts. In Madman a self-tortured poet tries to free<br />\nhimself from a mental hospital and finds a fellow-sufferer<br />\nin the nun who tries to cure him. Psychiatrists, orderlies,<br />\nthe Mother Superior are, without exception cruel and<br />\nunconcerned with the recovery of the patient. Naturally,<br />\nthey go insane at the end, while the inmates--the nun, the<br />\nmadman, and even the sadistic doctor--go free.<br />\nThough the Barnstormers try, they cannot surmount<br />\nthe great handicap of the play's datedness. Especially<br />\ndevastating is the trite, restrictive dialogue. For example,<br />\nthe madman rants about the stage, accusing \"form\" of<br />\nwining the imagination, a- standard 1920's gripe. He<br />\nlaments that society has turned into a machine and that<br />\nhis cure in the mental hospital has perpetuated his<br />\nmadness. At another point, Sister Anna moans, \"Now<br />\nthere's nothing--only a terrible, hopeless emptiness. I<br />\ndon't exist anymore.\" After making love with the<br />\nMadman, she offers to remain at the mental hospital if<br />\nthat were necessary to free him. \"I love you for what you<br /><br />\nare. You must fulfill your destiny...It's creativity. Perhaps<br />\nit's God.\" The only character to profit from this type of<br />\ndialogue is the Freudian psychoanalyst, Dr. Grun. Dressed<br />\nas Sigmund Freud, replete with beard, pipe and notebook,<br />\nhe is hilarious. In one of his classic lines he says: \"His (the<br />\nmadman's) breathing has stopped. Not even<br />\npsychoanalysis can help him now.\"<br />\nNevertheless, the actors and the director perform a<br />\ncreditable job in bringing the play to life with spirited,<br />\nphysical action and interesting blocking and makeup. Bill<br />\nNewlin, as Alexander Walpurg, the madman-poet, runs,<br />\njumps, and bangs his head against the wall and floor of his<br />\npadded cell, torn by his thwarted artistic passion and his<br />\ndaily doses of morphine--an early twentieth-century<br />\nBaudelaire. Unfortunately, his leaps from savagery to<br />\ntenderness are too sudden to allow the audience to<br />\nempathize with him. The stereotypical dialogue also<br />\ncontributes to the feeling that neither unchained<br />\nindividualism nor restrictive society is human. Melissa<br />\nKirschner (Sister Anna) does surprisingly well with lines<br />\nthat permit her little leeway from passivity and<br />\ndominance by the madman. She is the only sympathetic<br />\ncharacter in the play.<br />\nThe heavy, white-and-black stage make-up is effective<br />\nin creating a scene out of Anais Nin's \"Theatre of<br />\nCruelty.\" That every character except for the nun and the<br />\nmadman wear this make-up strikingly shows up the<br />\ndifference between the sensitive prisoners and the<br />\n.Cont. on p. 18<br /><br />\nTHE EFFECT UPON<br /><br />\nTHE AUDIENCE ISDEVASTATING<br /><br />\nHistoric Preservation Hall, at 726 St. Peter Street in<br />\nthe French Quarter of New Orleans, is where New<br />\nOrleans jazz is preserved. It is a congregation for old jazi<br />\nartists to play good old New Orleans jazz. Each year, a<br />\ndifferent group from the hall travels the country, and<br />\nlast Saturday, for the third year, the Preservation Hall<br />\nJazz Band performed at Hopkins. The band, composed<br />\nprimarily of septuagenarians, had the audience rocking<br />\nto their music all night long. And the encore of When<br />\nThe Saints Go Marching In, with the crowd on their feet<br />\nand hands clapping overhead, was as inspired and<br />\nspoptaneous, though not as loud, as any rock concert.<br /><br />\nPAGE 18 I NOVEMBER 17, 1978<br /><br />\nI At TIN Bijou<br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series was going to show<br />\nThrough the Looking Glass this weekend, before the<br />\nMaryland Board of Censors prohibited its showing.<br />\nActually the film was never censored. It has never been<br />\nviewed in Maryland, and the distributor of the film<br />\ndidn't want to contend with powerful, and sometimes<br />\nirrational censor board. So, the film series was unable to<br />\nobtain the film.<br />\nSuch policies are now common among many film<br />\ndistributors working with Maryland markets They don't<br />\nwant to deal with the last Board of Censors in the nation<br />\nor with 68 year old Mary Avara, who, along with two<br />\npart-time aides, has total dictatorial powers over what<br />\nwill and will not be screened for public viewing in<br />\nMaryland. The distributors will not argue with Avara<br />\nwho can rule that a film is either cut or it will not be<br />\nshown in Maryland.<br />\nCensorship of films by the board depends solely on<br />\nthe subjective opinion of Mrs. Avara, and her opinions<br />\nare determined by the degree of sex in the film She<br />\ncannot ban a film because of violence, language, or<br />\nartistic quality, but only on the basis of the amount of<br />\nsex and how explicity it is. Of course no one should be<br />\nable to prohibit public screening of a film based on the<br />\nquality of the film but should someone be able to ban<br />\nfilms based on the quality of the sex? Mrs. Avara is<br />\nsupposedly looking out for the morals of the State of<br />\nMaryaland, but in the Seventies, her board is certainly<br />\nobselete, and even repressive, controlling what we<br />\nshould and should not see<br />\nShe has tried to ban Aguirre, The Wrath of God, a<br />\nfilm by Wener Herzog which is part of the renaissance of<br />\nGerman cinema. It has been screened three times in<br />\nBaltimore this fall Once by the very respectable<br />\nBaltimore Film Forum), and although it has some<br />\ngraphic scenes, it is also serious, artististic cinema. In the<br />\npast Avara has tried cutting scenes of cunnilingus and<br />\nother things from some of John Waters' films. These<br />\nfilms always get a X rating, but she has tried to cut these<br />\nsnipets which she feels should not be viewed by<br />\nMaryland filmgoers. A cut, though, usually ruins the<br />\nprint of the film, and can completely alter the<br /><br />\nsignificance of a scene. The Maryland Board of Censor is<br />\nnot .only hatmful to the freedom of the public to view<br />\nwhatever films they choose, but it also unresponsive to<br />\nthe artistic achievement of many fine filmmakers.<br />\nEven an ignorant public would be able to decide<br />\nwhether they wanted to see a hard core porno flick or<br />\nnot, but Avara and her board must consider Marylanders<br />\nvery ignorant. And while the argument of banning<br />\npornography could be strong, Mrs. Avara also wants to<br />\nban films like Pretty Baby. She didn't like the portrayal<br />\nof a 12 year old girl selling her virginity to the highest<br />\nbidder. What Avara fails to see because she is looking<br />\nonly for illicit sex or decadent morals is the implicit art<br />\nof the scene. She does not realize that the scene is not<br />\ncalculated to offend or excite the viewer, but is closely<br />\ntied to the narrative and the ideas of the film as a whole.<br />\nInstead of Through the Looking Glass, the Senior<br />\nClass Film Series is showing Monty Python's And Now<br />\nFor Something Completely Different. This film is a<br />\ncollection of skits and episodes from their popular<br />\ntelevision series, and the laughter and enjoyments is<br />\nbetter sustained throughtout the film than in their full<br />\nlength comedies. Whereas with Looking Glass viewers<br />\nmight have run to the Rat to find partners for the new<br />\nthings they learned, with Monty Python, the whole<br />\ncampus will be subjected to versions of silly walks,<br />\ngumbies, twits and other Python sketches throughout<br />\nthe weekend. Mary Avara would call this good<br />\nwholesome fun.<br />\nCitizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons--These<br />\nfilms by Orson Welles are two of the great masterpieces .<br />\nof American cinema. Citizen Kane, considered the most<br />\nperfect American film, is the fascinating character study<br />\nof the powerful newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane,<br />\npatterned after the character of William Randolph<br />\nHearst. Welles gives a cinematic tour-de-force producing,<br />\ndirecting, writing and playing the part of Kane .in this<br />\nextraordinary film. The Magnificent Ambersons was<br />\nWelles' next production, and is the complex lament for a<br />\nbygone period in American history and the values bound<br />\nup in that time. The story follows the action of Tim<br />\nHolt, the last of a declining American dynasty.<br />\nUnfortunately, it is irresponsible that these films will be<br />\nshown over Thanksgiving holiday because they are two<br />\nAmerican masterpieces that should not be missed.<br />\nWeekend Wonderflix<br /><br />\nTHE JHU BOOK CENTER PRESENTS....<br /><br />\nAn OxFoRO<br />\nUniveasitg Press<br />\n500th BiatbOag<br />\nCelebration<br />\nAll OxfoRO<br />\nUniveasitg<br />\nRefemence<br />\nWoRks<br /><br />\nMadman and Nun<br /><br />\nCont. from p. 17<br />\nrepressive censor board of sane society.

Mark<br />\nWolfram made the defensive play<br />\nof the game by knocking away a<br />\nsure goal aimed at the left corner<br />\nof the net.<br />\nThe tournament ended on an<br />\nunhappy note, however, when,in<br />\nthe final game between<br />\nMonmouth and Boston College,<br />\nthe Boston College coach gouged<br />\nthe eyes of the Monmouth goalie<br />\nas he got out of the water for a<br />\n30-second foul. Both benches,<br />\nthe stands, and the water<br />\n.emptied as nearly everyone tried<br />\nto tear the B.C. coach limb from<br />\nlimb for his blatantly<br />\nunsportsmanlike conduct. As a<br />\nresult, referees forfeited the game<br />\nto Monmouth, despite the fact<br />\nthat Boston College would have<br />\nprobably won due to their<br />\ncomfortable 3-goal lead with<br />\n2:30 left in the contest.<br />\nNevertheless, it was a good<br />\nCont. on 22<br /><br />\nBY RICHARD MILLER<br />\nDespite outstanding<br />\nperformances by a number of<br />\nfreshman substitutes, the Blue<br />\nJay grid squad dropped its sixth<br />\ndecision of the 1978 campaign, a<br />\n27-13 defeat to archrival Western<br />\nMaryland. The loss gave the<br />\nGreen Terrrors their 26th win in<br />\nthe 57 year-old series, and<br />\ndropped Hopkins' final season<br />\nrecord to 3-6.<br />\nWestern Maryland jumped out<br />\nto a 7-point lead early in the first<br />\nperiod, as senior signal-caller Joe<br />\nDamiano piloted the Terrors to<br />\ntheir first score, a 5-yard trot by<br />\nrunning back Eric DeGross.<br />\nIn the second period of play,<br />\nan interception by Green Terror<br />\ndefensive back Mike Sanders set<br />\nup Western Maryland's second<br />\nscore, an eight yard run by<br />\nDamiano midway through the<br />\nperiod. Freshman place-kicker<br />\nCraig Walker added his second<br />\nextra point of the contest, giving<br />\nthe Green Terrors a commanding<br />\n14-0 lead.<br />\nAlthough an enthusiastic<br />\nWestern Maryland defense<br />\ncompletely shut down Hopkins'<br />\nground-game, the Blue Jays were<br />\nstill able to draw blood late in<br />\nthe first half. Paced by<br />\nnationally-ranked quarterback<br />\nJim Margraff, the Blue Jays<br />\nquickly reestablished their<br />\npassing attack, allowing talented<br />\nreceiver Bill Stromberg to haul in<br />\n, his 13th touchdown of the<br />\nseason on a 50-yard Margraff<br />\nbomb. Kicker Jeff Harris capped<br />\nthe score with his 16th extra<br />\npoint of the season.<br /><br />\nDespite a 7 point halftime<br />\ndeficit, the Blue Jays still<br />\nappeared competitive in the early<br />\nmoments of the second stanza,<br />\nhalting the Green Terrors' initial<br />\ndrive following the kickoff. A<br />\nroughing-the-kicker penalty<br />\nagainst senior tri-captain Steve<br />\nWey sustained the Western<br />\nMaryland drive, however; a drive<br />\nwhich culminated in a 51-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass from Damiano<br />\nto receiver Tom Chadwick.<br />\nThe Blue Jays quickly<br />\nresponded to Western Maryland's<br />\nThe Game at a GlanGe<br />\nJ.
