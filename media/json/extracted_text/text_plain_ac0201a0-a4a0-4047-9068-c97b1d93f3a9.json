Haverford made the discovery early in the game that it<br />\nwas next to impossible to gain<br />\nthrough the Black and Blue line.<br />\nThereupon, the Quakers tried out<br />\nthe aerial style of play, and finding this successful, they proceeded<br />\nto complete during the remainder<br />\nof the contest, forward passes of<br />\nevery kind and description for<br />\nboth long and short gains, that<br />\nfinally brought victory to Haverford and spelt defeat for Hopkins.<br />\nIt looked like a tie game at the<br />\nlatter part of the final period,<br />\nwhen the score stood 7 to 7. Then<br />\nHaverford pulled off the unexpected. An exchange of punts resulted in the visitors' ball on the<br />\nBlack and Blue 35-yard line. In<br />\nthe few remaining minutes of<br />\nplay, a series of. beautiful forward<br />\npasses and several line plunges,<br />\nand the Quakers had scored an<br />\nadditional touchdown.<br />\nThere was no scoring during<br />\nthe first half. The period was featured, for the most part, by a<br />\nvigorous punting duel, with Leadbetter in the stellar role for Hopkins, and Crossman for Haverford. Haverford lost a chance to<br />\nscore at the beginning of the second quarter due to the excellent<br />\nwork of Doc Brooks. The Quakers<br />\ncompleted a forward pass which<br />\nbrought the ball to Hopkins' 20yard line, and then advanced it to<br />\nthe 7-yard line. It looked like a<br />\nsure touchdown for the visitors.<br />\nBut the Black and Blue line<br />\nbraced, and on the next three<br />\nplays, Haverford failed to gain.<br />\nWith but one down left in which<br />\nto score, the Quakers threw a low<br />\npass which was caught by Chandler. However, Brooks nailed him,<br />\nand the ball went to Hopkins on<br />\ndowns, with the pigskin a few<br />\ninches inside the goal line. There<br />\nwas little action during the remainder of the period.<br />\nThe visitors made the first score<br />\nof the game shortly after the<br />\nopening of the second half. A long<br />\npass from the center of the field,<br />\nCrossman to Chandler, put the<br />\nball on Hopkins' 20-yard. line.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to plans recently<br />\nadopted, all the undergraduate<br />\nlaboratory work in chemistry will<br />\nbe moved to Homewood by January 1. The University officials<br />\nhave definitely decided on the<br />\nmove, and work will be b'egun in<br />\ninstalling the new laboratory as<br />\nsoon as the equipment can be obtained from the manufacturers.<br />\nThe laboratory will be situated<br />\nin the south end of the basement<br />\nof the Mechanical Engineering<br />\nBuilding. This will be the home<br />\nof the undergraduate chemistry<br />\ndepartment until funds are available for the erection of the main<br />\nchemical laboratory at the northeast corner of the main quadrangle.<br />\nDoctor Gilpin,who has had charge<br />\nof selecting the new apparatus<br />\nand arranging the laboratory, has<br />\nstated that the equipment used<br />\nwill be entirely new, with the exception of such supplies of chemicals, bottles, tubing, etc., as can<br />\nbe easily transported to Homewood. The new equipment has<br />\nbeen designed with a view to a<br />\nwhole new chemical building at<br />\nHomewood. When such a laboratory is built, the apparatus to be<br />\nput in the basement of the Mechanical Engineering Building<br />\nwill be moved to it.<br />\nDoctor Gilpin and Doctor Miller will have charge of the new<br />\nlaboratory, where all the undergraduate classes will be housed.<br />\nAll three classes will necessarily<br />\nbe in the one room at Homewood,<br />\nbut each class will be isolated in<br />\na different part of the room. The<br />\ngraduate students will still have<br />\nto pursue their work downtown<br />\nin the old laboratory, until a<br />\nwhole new chemical building can<br />\nbe erected at Homewood.<br />\nThe new laboratory arrangement will solve many of the problems confronting the chemical department at present. The next<br />\nadvantage is that the undergraduates will no longer have to go<br />\nfrom Homewood down town for<br />\ntheir laboratory work.<br />\nBesides the new equipment, especially made to order after the<br />\ndesigns of Doctor Gilpin, the<br />\nbasement of the Mechanical Engineering Building will contain<br />\na chemical stock and supply room<br />\nand an office.<br />\nThe actual moving will be done<br />\nduring the Christmas holidays,<br />\nthe laboratory work in the new<br />\nquarters starting when the University routine is resumed on<br />\nJanuary 3.<br />\n<br />\nCharles Hillman Brough, Ph.<br />\nD., LL. D., the successful candidate for governor of Arkansas in<br />\nthe recent election, was a graduate student in economics at Johns<br />\nHopkins for three years and received his degree from this University. He is well remembered<br />\nby the professors under whom he<br />\nworked both for his attractive<br />\npersonality and his brilliancy in<br />\nstudies.<br />\nDoctor Brough was born in Mississippi in 1876, the son of Charles<br />\nM. Brough. He attended Mississippi College, where he received<br />\nhis A. B. in 1894. He came here<br />\nin the autumn of 1895 to become<br />\na graduate student in economics,<br />\nbecoming a fellow in that subject<br />\nin 1897, and receiving his Ph. D.<br />\nin June, 1898. Mr. Brougli then<br />\nbecame professor of economics in<br />\nMississippi College, where he remained until 1901. He was<br />\nawarded an LL. D. by the University of Mississippi in 1902, and,<br />\nthe same year became professor<br />\nof economics at Hillman College.<br />\nThe following year he was appointed professor of economics<br />\nand sociology at the University of<br />\nArkansas. He held this position<br />\nuntil he resigned in order to run<br />\nfor the governorship.<br />\nDoctor Brough was the Democratic candidate. In the Democratic primary, held last March,<br />\nhe received as many votes as his<br />\ntwo opponents combined. He is a<br />\nstrong supporter of President<br />\nWilson, having organized in 1912<br />\nthe Arkansas branch of the Woodrow Wilson College Men's League.<br />\nHe canvassed Arkansas, Tennessee Maine, Illinois, and several<br />\nother States in Wilson's behalf in<br />\nthe recent campaign, and it is<br />\nconsidered that much of the credit<br />\nfor the Democratic landslide in<br />\nArkansas should be given to Doctor Brough.<br />\nThe governor-elect's entrance<br />\ninto Arkansas politics was partly<br />\ndue to his numerous speeches<br />\nat high school commencements<br />\nthroughout the State. He was<br />\nproposed for the governorship in<br />\n1914, but withdrew in favor of<br />\nanother candidate. He was bitterly attacked during his campaign because of a dissertation<br />\ndefending Mormomism, written<br />\nwhile ht Johns Hopkins as a partfial fulfillment of the requirements for his Ph. D.<br />\nDoctor Brough's literary contributions have, in the main, been<br />\n<br />\nThe team was defeated Saturday in a game that for a long<br />\ntime seemed destined to end in a<br />\ntie score, but Haverford in<br />\nthe last few minutes of play<br />\nopened up a forward pass attack<br />\nwith which the Hopkins defense<br />\nwas utterly unable to cope and<br />\nwhich gave Haverford the touchdown that decided the game in<br />\ntheir favor. This exhibition of<br />\nforward passing was, without<br />\ndoubt, the best ever seen in this<br />\npart of the country and is indicative of what can be done with<br />\nsuch a method of attack, executed<br />\nas it was Saturday.<br />\nSincere criticism was made of<br />\nour defense against this play<br />\nSaturday as was of our failure<br />\nto utilize such an attack, and in<br />\njustice to the team some explanation is necessary. Forward passing requires careful and persistent practice, and most of all it requires daylight. Dr. Bennett, the<br />\nHaverford coach, infoimed the<br />\nwriter that hours were spent on<br />\nthis play before it was perfected<br />\nand that he considered it useless<br />\nto try to practice it after dark.<br />\nTo be sure, our team is equipped<br />\nwith forward-pass plays, and ones<br />\nthe efficacy of which has been well<br />\ntested, but the daylight needed<br />\nfor their perfection is lacking.<br />\nHad we the power of Joshua, conditions might be altered, but as<br />\nit is, our forward-pass practice is<br />\nheld under most unpromising conditions. The same requisites are<br />\nneeded for defense against the<br />\npass as for its development.<br />\nNevertheless, work is going on in<br />\nthis phase of the game, and it is<br />\nhoped that in the next two games<br />\nsome good results will be shown.<br />\nIn the straight frontal attack<br />\nour team showed up exceedingly<br />\nwell, for they at least held their<br />\nown, while on defense against<br />\nrushing, we had a shade on Haverford, and this despite the fact<br />\nthat the line work as a whole was<br />\nnot so good as in the Western<br />\nMaryland game. That game took<br />\na great deal out of the men and<br />\na more or less conscious let-down<br />\nwas necessary last week in order<br />\nto have the men gradually round<br />\ninto shape.<br />\nThe backfield has not yet<br />\nreached the form desired, as they<br />\nare not properly picking the holes<br />\nand are not helping each other<br />\nenough in interference.

The<br />\nobjects of this system were the<br />\ninsuring of impartial debates, the<br />\nfacilitating of the selection of<br />\njudges, and the establishment of<br />\nbroader and more intimate relations between the three universities. These conditions have<br />\nproved exceptionally satisfactory<br />\nin the past, and their fairness has<br />\nbeen so evident, that the agreement was printed in full in a recent Intercollegiate Debate Book<br />\nas a model for the use of other institutions. During the past three<br />\nyears, each debating season has<br />\nbeen begun by a quick ratification<br />\nof this agreement by all three universities. Just before the meeting<br />\nof the Council last week, however,<br />\nDr. French received a telegram<br />\nfrom the Univeisity of Virginia,<br />\nasking that this year the agreement be so modified as to permit<br />\none team from each university to<br />\ndebate on its own ground.<br />\nAfter consultation, the Hopkins<br />\nCouncil came to the unanimous<br />\nargeement that such a change, in<br />\ntheir opinion, was inadvisable,<br />\nand a night letter to that effect<br />\nwas immediately dispatched to<br />\nVirginia. No answer to that letter has as yet been received, and<br />\nit is therefore not known whether<br />\nVirginia will withdraw its request, or whether it will insist<br />\nupon the new conditions, even to<br />\nthe breaking up of the triangle.<br />\nWith the night letter to Virginia, a letter was dispatched to<br />\nNorth Carolina, asking if the<br />\nagreement was still satisfactory<br />\nto that university. As no objection from that quarter has been<br />\nheard, the Council deems it probable that the authorities at<br />\nChapel Hill are behind the agreement as it stands, which fact, if<br />\nit be confirmed, will strengthen<br />\nHopkins' position considerably.<br />\nWhile desirous that the triangle be continued, if possible, under the old conditions, Hopkins<br />\nhas nothing to fear even were it<br />\nto be dissolved. The record of<br />\nthree successive victories which it<br />\nholds will insure it debates with<br />\nother colleges and universities of<br />\n<br />\nThe Hqpkins Independent Basket-ball Team is well on the road<br />\nto organization. The schedule is<br />\nalmost complete, and the available material for the team is of<br />\nan exceptionally fine calibre.<br />\nSince last week many playei.s<br />\nnot considered in the original list<br />\nhave told Pfitsch, captain and<br />\nmanager, that they intended to<br />\ncome out. Among these are Love,<br />\na forward and captain of last<br />\nyear's sophomore team; Joe Branham, who played guard on the<br />\nWashington College team for several seasons; Smith, a center from<br />\nRandolph Macon College; Littman, a guard on last year's City<br />\nCollege team; Wood, a forward<br />\nfrom Swarthmore Preparatory<br />\nSchool; and Cashell, formerly a<br />\nforward on the Rockhill High<br />\nSchool five.<br />\nPractice will begin some time<br />\nthis week for those men that are<br />\nnot out for the football team. A<br />\nplace in which to practice has<br />\nbeen secured, but for the present<br />\nthe name of the hall will only be<br />\nannounced to the players.<br />\nIn addition to the games that<br />\nwere announced in last week's issue of THE NEWS-LETTER, another<br />\ncontest has been booked. The independents will play the Naval<br />\nAcademy at Annapolis on December 16. This will be the opening<br />\ngame of the season, which will<br />\ncontinue until April 1.<br />\nWhile the present lineup of the<br />\nfive is a remarkably good one<br />\n\u2014with Brooks and Cox, guards;<br />\nPfitsch, center; and Shureich and<br />\nBuchness playing the forward positions\u2014several of the new men<br />\nare brilliant players and a hot<br />\nfight for the positions is expected.<br />\nSix or seven men will be carried<br />\non all of the trips.<br />\nMenorah Study Circles Flourishing.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Menorah<br />\nSociety is having an unusually<br />\nsuccessful season.

If<br />\nthe class decides that they wish<br />\nthe traditional nature of the Hullabaloo to be preserved,the change<br />\nin policy should be revoked. In<br />\neither case, before the Hullabaloo<br />\nboard proceeds further with its<br />\nplan, it should correct what, in<br />\neither eventuality, has been a<br />\ngrave misconception of function\u2014<br />\nit should discover the sentiment<br />\nof the men who elected it.<br />\nIn such a class discussion, one<br />\nthing must be borne in mind. The<br />\nbook which will be published at<br />\nthe end of the year will be either<br />\na senior class book or it will be<br />\nan undergraduate annual. The<br />\nissue is clear-cut\u2014and it must be<br />\nso presented by the Hullabaloo<br />\nboard. The Hullabaloos of the<br />\npast have represented all University activities, and yet have been<br />\nsenior books; a change from the<br />\npolicy under which those books<br />\nwere conceived, a change which<br />\nhas been deemed important enough<br />\nto be announced individually to<br />\nevery undergraduate, cannot be<br />\nmisinterpreted. A book conceived<br />\nas an undergraduate annual cannot,.in the nature of things, still<br />\nbe a senior book. The members of<br />\nthe Class of 1917 must pass a vote<br />\nof approval or disapproval upon<br />\nthe policy of the Hullabaloo<br />\nboard, but, what is more important, they should have made clear<br />\nto them exactly upon what they<br />\nare voting.<br />\nThe question is too vital a one<br />\nto permit of ambiguity or of misunderstanding. If 1917 is to issue<br />\nan annual instead of a class book,<br />\nit must be done so with a full<br />\nknowledge on the part of every<br />\nman of the difference which lies<br />\nbetween the two.<br />\nIn the opinion of THE NEWSLETTER, the reason for the entire<br />\nchange of policy meditated by the<br />\n1917 Hullabaloo Board is amply<br />\nexplained by one phrase \u2014 \"Hopkins' traditions are nil.\" In that<br />\nphrase is expressed the great<br />\ndanger which, more than any<br />\nother, the Hopkins of the future<br />\nwill have to overcome. The Hopkins undergraduates of the past,<br />\nit is true, have never worn little<br />\nblack and blue caps during their<br />\nfreshman years, nor have their<br />\nsenior classes published books resplendent in myriad photographs<br />\nand pages. But the Hopkins of<br />\nthe past has meant something,<br />\nmeant something far too important to be nullified by the opinions<br />\nof any board or of any class. It<br />\nhas not been a matter of the obvious, flaunting customs of the<br />\ntypical small college; it has been<br />\na matter of outlook, of understanding, of appreciation. The<br />\nthing against which Hopkins has<br />\nto guard today is not a matter of<br />\ngrowing too slowly, it is a matter<br />\nof growing too fast.

An alteration in<br />\nthe fudamental idea of one of the<br />\noldest of Hopkins' institutions is<br />\ntoo important a matter to be undertaken without the express approval of the class to whom the<br />\neditors of the Hullabaloo are always responsible.

This position, however, is<br />\nfully known, and the independent<br />\nteams which Hopkins produces<br />\nare viewed, not as outlaw aggregations, but rather as teams<br />\nwhich are undergoing a period of<br />\nprobation before the expense entailed by their recognition can<br />\nbe undertaken.<br />\nIt is this place which the independent swimming team has occupied for the last few years, and in<br />\nwhich it is now to be joined by<br />\nthe independent basket-ball team.<br />\nThe organization of those teams<br />\nis no easy matter, and the men<br />\nwho are responsible for such organization are all the more entitled to praise, in that they<br />\nknow that, for some time at least,<br />\ntheir efforts must go unrewarded.<br />\nThere is at Hopkins an unusually<br />\nlarge number of good basket-ball<br />\nplayers, and the enthusiasm with<br />\nwhich these players have answered<br />\nthe call for volunteers is a rather<br />\nencouraging augury that if the<br />\nbasket-ball team this year will not<br />\nrepresent the University in name<br />\nit will at least represent it in<br />\nmerit.<br />\n<br />\nPRIZES TO BE AWARDED<br />\nFOR BEST BOTANICAL ESSAYS<br />\n<br />\nLewis and Valentine Company,<br />\nlandscape gardeners and nursery<br />\nexperts, have offered prizes for<br />\nthe best essays on old Suffruticosa boxwood.

Haverford made the discovery early in the game that it<br />\nwas next to impossible to gain<br />\nthrough the Black and Blue line.<br />\nThereupon, the Quakers tried out<br />\nthe aerial style of play, and finding this successful, they proceeded<br />\nto complete during the remainder<br />\nof the contest, forward passes of<br />\nevery kind and description for<br />\nboth long and short gains, that<br />\nfinally brought victory to Haverford and spelt defeat for Hopkins.<br />\nIt looked like a tie game at the<br />\nlatter part of the final period,<br />\nwhen the score stood 7 to 7. Then<br />\nHaverford pulled off the unexpected. An exchange of punts resulted in the visitors' ball on the<br />\nBlack and Blue 35-yard line. In<br />\nthe few remaining minutes of<br />\nplay, a series of. beautiful forward<br />\npasses and several line plunges,<br />\nand the Quakers had scored an<br />\nadditional touchdown.<br />\nThere was no scoring during<br />\nthe first half. The period was featured, for the most part, by a<br />\nvigorous punting duel, with Leadbetter in the stellar role for Hopkins, and Crossman for Haverford. Haverford lost a chance to<br />\nscore at the beginning of the second quarter due to the excellent<br />\nwork of Doc Brooks. The Quakers<br />\ncompleted a forward pass which<br />\nbrought the ball to Hopkins' 20yard line, and then advanced it to<br />\nthe 7-yard line. It looked like a<br />\nsure touchdown for the visitors.<br />\nBut the Black and Blue line<br />\nbraced, and on the next three<br />\nplays, Haverford failed to gain.<br />\nWith but one down left in which<br />\nto score, the Quakers threw a low<br />\npass which was caught by Chandler.

The University officials<br />\nhave definitely decided on the<br />\nmove, and work will be b'egun in<br />\ninstalling the new laboratory as<br />\nsoon as the equipment can be obtained from the manufacturers.<br />\nThe laboratory will be situated<br />\nin the south end of the basement<br />\nof the Mechanical Engineering<br />\nBuilding.

The new equipment has<br />\nbeen designed with a view to a<br />\nwhole new chemical building at<br />\nHomewood.

D., the successful candidate for governor of Arkansas in<br />\nthe recent election, was a graduate student in economics at Johns<br />\nHopkins for three years and received his degree from this University. He is well remembered<br />\nby the professors under whom he<br />\nworked both for his attractive<br />\npersonality and his brilliancy in<br />\nstudies.<br />\nDoctor Brough was born in Mississippi in 1876, the son of Charles<br />\nM. Brough. He attended Mississippi College, where he received<br />\nhis A. B. in 1894. He came here<br />\nin the autumn of 1895 to become<br />\na graduate student in economics,<br />\nbecoming a fellow in that subject<br />\nin 1897, and receiving his Ph. D.<br />\nin June, 1898. Mr. Brougli then<br />\nbecame professor of economics in<br />\nMississippi College, where he remained until 1901. He was<br />\nawarded an LL. D. by the University of Mississippi in 1902, and,<br />\nthe same year became professor<br />\nof economics at Hillman College.<br />\nThe following year he was appointed professor of economics<br />\nand sociology at the University of<br />\nArkansas. He held this position<br />\nuntil he resigned in order to run<br />\nfor the governorship.<br />\nDoctor Brough was the Democratic candidate. In the Democratic primary, held last March,<br />\nhe received as many votes as his<br />\ntwo opponents combined. He is a<br />\nstrong supporter of President<br />\nWilson, having organized in 1912<br />\nthe Arkansas branch of the Woodrow Wilson College Men's League.<br />\nHe canvassed Arkansas, Tennessee Maine, Illinois, and several<br />\nother States in Wilson's behalf in<br />\nthe recent campaign, and it is<br />\nconsidered that much of the credit<br />\nfor the Democratic landslide in<br />\nArkansas should be given to Doctor Brough.<br />\nThe governor-elect's entrance<br />\ninto Arkansas politics was partly<br />\ndue to his numerous speeches<br />\nat high school commencements<br />\nthroughout the State. He was<br />\nproposed for the governorship in<br />\n1914, but withdrew in favor of<br />\nanother candidate. He was bitterly attacked during his campaign because of a dissertation<br />\ndefending Mormomism, written<br />\nwhile ht Johns Hopkins as a partfial fulfillment of the requirements for his Ph.

This exhibition of<br />\nforward passing was, without<br />\ndoubt, the best ever seen in this<br />\npart of the country and is indicative of what can be done with<br />\nsuch a method of attack, executed<br />\nas it was Saturday.<br />\nSincere criticism was made of<br />\nour defense against this play<br />\nSaturday as was of our failure<br />\nto utilize such an attack, and in<br />\njustice to the team some explanation is necessary. Forward passing requires careful and persistent practice, and most of all it requires daylight. Dr. Bennett, the<br />\nHaverford coach, infoimed the<br />\nwriter that hours were spent on<br />\nthis play before it was perfected<br />\nand that he considered it useless<br />\nto try to practice it after dark.<br />\nTo be sure, our team is equipped<br />\nwith forward-pass plays, and ones<br />\nthe efficacy of which has been well<br />\ntested, but the daylight needed<br />\nfor their perfection is lacking.<br />\nHad we the power of Joshua, conditions might be altered, but as<br />\nit is, our forward-pass practice is<br />\nheld under most unpromising conditions. The same requisites are<br />\nneeded for defense against the<br />\npass as for its development.<br />\nNevertheless, work is going on in<br />\nthis phase of the game, and it is<br />\nhoped that in the next two games<br />\nsome good results will be shown.<br />\nIn the straight frontal attack<br />\nour team showed up exceedingly<br />\nwell, for they at least held their<br />\nown, while on defense against<br />\nrushing, we had a shade on Haverford, and this despite the fact<br />\nthat the line work as a whole was<br />\nnot so good as in the Western<br />\nMaryland game. That game took<br />\na great deal out of the men and<br />\na more or less conscious let-down<br />\nwas necessary last week in order<br />\nto have the men gradually round<br />\ninto shape.<br />\nThe backfield has not yet<br />\nreached the form desired, as they<br />\nare not properly picking the holes<br />\nand are not helping each other<br />\nenough in interference.

The<br />\nobjects of this system were the<br />\ninsuring of impartial debates, the<br />\nfacilitating of the selection of<br />\njudges, and the establishment of<br />\nbroader and more intimate relations between the three universities. These conditions have<br />\nproved exceptionally satisfactory<br />\nin the past, and their fairness has<br />\nbeen so evident, that the agreement was printed in full in a recent Intercollegiate Debate Book<br />\nas a model for the use of other institutions. During the past three<br />\nyears, each debating season has<br />\nbeen begun by a quick ratification<br />\nof this agreement by all three universities. Just before the meeting<br />\nof the Council last week, however,<br />\nDr. French received a telegram<br />\nfrom the Univeisity of Virginia,<br />\nasking that this year the agreement be so modified as to permit<br />\none team from each university to<br />\ndebate on its own ground.<br />\nAfter consultation, the Hopkins<br />\nCouncil came to the unanimous<br />\nargeement that such a change, in<br />\ntheir opinion, was inadvisable,<br />\nand a night letter to that effect<br />\nwas immediately dispatched to<br />\nVirginia. No answer to that letter has as yet been received, and<br />\nit is therefore not known whether<br />\nVirginia will withdraw its request, or whether it will insist<br />\nupon the new conditions, even to<br />\nthe breaking up of the triangle.<br />\nWith the night letter to Virginia, a letter was dispatched to<br />\nNorth Carolina, asking if the<br />\nagreement was still satisfactory<br />\nto that university. As no objection from that quarter has been<br />\nheard, the Council deems it probable that the authorities at<br />\nChapel Hill are behind the agreement as it stands, which fact, if<br />\nit be confirmed, will strengthen<br />\nHopkins' position considerably.<br />\nWhile desirous that the triangle be continued, if possible, under the old conditions, Hopkins<br />\nhas nothing to fear even were it<br />\nto be dissolved. The record of<br />\nthree successive victories which it<br />\nholds will insure it debates with<br />\nother colleges and universities of<br /><br />\nThe Hqpkins Independent Basket-ball Team is well on the road<br />\nto organization. The schedule is<br />\nalmost complete, and the available material for the team is of<br />\nan exceptionally fine calibre.<br />\nSince last week many playei.s<br />\nnot considered in the original list<br />\nhave told Pfitsch, captain and<br />\nmanager, that they intended to<br />\ncome out. Among these are Love,<br />\na forward and captain of last<br />\nyear's sophomore team; Joe Branham, who played guard on the<br />\nWashington College team for several seasons; Smith, a center from<br />\nRandolph Macon College; Littman, a guard on last year's City<br />\nCollege team; Wood, a forward<br />\nfrom Swarthmore Preparatory<br />\nSchool; and Cashell, formerly a<br />\nforward on the Rockhill High<br />\nSchool five.<br />\nPractice will begin some time<br />\nthis week for those men that are<br />\nnot out for the football team. A<br />\nplace in which to practice has<br />\nbeen secured, but for the present<br />\nthe name of the hall will only be<br />\nannounced to the players.<br />\nIn addition to the games that<br />\nwere announced in last week's issue of THE NEWS-LETTER, another<br />\ncontest has been booked. The independents will play the Naval<br />\nAcademy at Annapolis on December 16. This will be the opening<br />\ngame of the season, which will<br />\ncontinue until April 1.<br />\nWhile the present lineup of the<br />\nfive is a remarkably good one<br />\n\u2014with Brooks and Cox, guards;<br />\nPfitsch, center; and Shureich and<br />\nBuchness playing the forward positions\u2014several of the new men<br />\nare brilliant players and a hot<br />\nfight for the positions is expected.<br />\nSix or seven men will be carried<br />\non all of the trips.<br />\nMenorah Study Circles Flourishing.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Menorah<br />\nSociety is having an unusually<br />\nsuccessful season.

If<br />\nthe class decides that they wish<br />\nthe traditional nature of the Hullabaloo to be preserved,the change<br />\nin policy should be revoked. In<br />\neither case, before the Hullabaloo<br />\nboard proceeds further with its<br />\nplan, it should correct what, in<br />\neither eventuality, has been a<br />\ngrave misconception of function\u2014<br />\nit should discover the sentiment<br />\nof the men who elected it.<br />\nIn such a class discussion, one<br />\nthing must be borne in mind. The<br />\nbook which will be published at<br />\nthe end of the year will be either<br />\na senior class book or it will be<br />\nan undergraduate annual. The<br />\nissue is clear-cut\u2014and it must be<br />\nso presented by the Hullabaloo<br />\nboard. The Hullabaloos of the<br />\npast have represented all University activities, and yet have been<br />\nsenior books; a change from the<br />\npolicy under which those books<br />\nwere conceived, a change which<br />\nhas been deemed important enough<br />\nto be announced individually to<br />\nevery undergraduate, cannot be<br />\nmisinterpreted. A book conceived<br />\nas an undergraduate annual cannot,.in the nature of things, still<br />\nbe a senior book. The members of<br />\nthe Class of 1917 must pass a vote<br />\nof approval or disapproval upon<br />\nthe policy of the Hullabaloo<br />\nboard, but, what is more important, they should have made clear<br />\nto them exactly upon what they<br />\nare voting.<br />\nThe question is too vital a one<br />\nto permit of ambiguity or of misunderstanding. If 1917 is to issue<br />\nan annual instead of a class book,<br />\nit must be done so with a full<br />\nknowledge on the part of every<br />\nman of the difference which lies<br />\nbetween the two.<br />\nIn the opinion of THE NEWSLETTER, the reason for the entire<br />\nchange of policy meditated by the<br />\n1917 Hullabaloo Board is amply<br />\nexplained by one phrase \u2014 \"Hopkins' traditions are nil.\" In that<br />\nphrase is expressed the great<br />\ndanger which, more than any<br />\nother, the Hopkins of the future<br />\nwill have to overcome. The Hopkins undergraduates of the past,<br />\nit is true, have never worn little<br />\nblack and blue caps during their<br />\nfreshman years, nor have their<br />\nsenior classes published books resplendent in myriad photographs<br />\nand pages. But the Hopkins of<br />\nthe past has meant something,<br />\nmeant something far too important to be nullified by the opinions<br />\nof any board or of any class. It<br />\nhas not been a matter of the obvious, flaunting customs of the<br />\ntypical small college; it has been<br />\na matter of outlook, of understanding, of appreciation. The<br />\nthing against which Hopkins has<br />\nto guard today is not a matter of<br />\ngrowing too slowly, it is a matter<br />\nof growing too fast.

An alteration in<br />\nthe fudamental idea of one of the<br />\noldest of Hopkins' institutions is<br />\ntoo important a matter to be undertaken without the express approval of the class to whom the<br />\neditors of the Hullabaloo are always responsible.

This position, however, is<br />\nfully known, and the independent<br />\nteams which Hopkins produces<br />\nare viewed, not as outlaw aggregations, but rather as teams<br />\nwhich are undergoing a period of<br />\nprobation before the expense entailed by their recognition can<br />\nbe undertaken.<br />\nIt is this place which the independent swimming team has occupied for the last few years, and in<br />\nwhich it is now to be joined by<br />\nthe independent basket-ball team.<br />\nThe organization of those teams<br />\nis no easy matter, and the men<br />\nwho are responsible for such organization are all the more entitled to praise, in that they<br />\nknow that, for some time at least,<br />\ntheir efforts must go unrewarded.<br />\nThere is at Hopkins an unusually<br />\nlarge number of good basket-ball<br />\nplayers, and the enthusiasm with<br />\nwhich these players have answered<br />\nthe call for volunteers is a rather<br />\nencouraging augury that if the<br />\nbasket-ball team this year will not<br />\nrepresent the University in name<br />\nit will at least represent it in<br />\nmerit.<br /><br />\nPRIZES TO BE AWARDED<br />\nFOR BEST BOTANICAL ESSAYS<br /><br />\nLewis and Valentine Company,<br />\nlandscape gardeners and nursery<br />\nexperts, have offered prizes for<br />\nthe best essays on old Suffruticosa boxwood.
