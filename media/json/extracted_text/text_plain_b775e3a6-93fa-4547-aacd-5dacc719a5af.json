It's...<br />\nBERGER: Eyecatching. We're<br />\nvery excited to have the radio stations sponsoring us this year.<br />\nThat's one thing that we have<br />\ndone differently this year.<br />\nMOUL: We've had radio stations<br />\nSee SPRING FAIR, 4<br />\n<br />\nCUS, from 1<br />\nAcademic Council. The CUS's<br />\nvoting members comprise four<br />\nstudents and six faculty members,<br />\nincluding Dean of Academic Advising Martha Roseman, who<br />\nchairs the CUS. The deans of<br />\nArts and Sciences and Engineering attend the CUS meetings, but<br />\nhave no vote.<br />\nThe Academic Council is composed of faculty and administrators, including University<br />\npresident Steven Muller. It<br />\nultimately set University policy<br />\non all academic matters.<br />\nThe CUS itself has no power<br />\nto enact academic rule changes.<br />\nAccording to the committee's<br />\ncharge, the CUS may submit proposals regarding undergraduate<br />\nacademic programs and degree<br />\nrequirements to the Academic<br />\nCouncil for approval. In the past<br />\nthese proposals have ranged from<br />\nchanging the add/drop policy to<br />\nthe creation of new majors and<br />\nminors. Either students or faculty members of the CUS may submit proposals.<br />\nWhile the CUS has been effective in formulating new policies,<br />\nDe Cagna decried the lack of formal by-laws defining the role of<br />\nthe CUS. In his view, the<br />\nAcademic Council should not impinge on the rights of the CUS<br />\nand the Student Council in determining the CUS's student<br />\nmembership.<br />\n<br />\nDe Cagna called the rule<br />\nchange requiring an engineering<br />\nstudent on the CUS an infringement upon the Student Council<br />\nright to choose the CUS<br />\nmembers.<br />\nTraditionally, the four student<br />\nmembers of the CUS are: the Student Council president, the<br />\nEducation Committee chair of the<br />\nStudent Council, and two additional students selected by the<br />\nCommittee on Committees<br />\n(COC). In the past, engineering<br />\nstudents have generally not been<br />\nmembers of the CUS.<br />\nQuestioned about the lack of<br />\nengineering students on the CUS,<br />\nDe Cagna wondered \"where they<br />\nwere at application time?\" He felt<br />\nthat if the G.W.C. Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering is concerned about the lack of engineering<br />\nstudent representation, the deans<br />\nand faculty members of that<br />\nschool should encourage their<br />\nstudents to apply for the CUS, not<br />\nmandate a position.<br />\n\"It -should never be the policy<br />\nof any organization to choose its<br />\nmembers based on the number of<br />\napplications it receives from any<br />\nspecific group,\" countered<br />\nHoward Ying of Tau Beta Pi, the<br />\nnational engineering honor society. \"The G.W.C. Whiting School<br />\nas a separate school merits at least<br />\none member on the CUS,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n<br />\nWolman<br />\nmade provost<br />\nWOLMAN, from 1<br />\nchallenges upon arriving at<br />\nHopkins. Along with becoming<br />\nan expert at how Hopkins actually<br />\n.operates, he will have to name a<br />\npermanent provost, and a new<br />\ndean for the School of Health and<br />\nPublic Hygiene. President<br />\nRichardson will also have to<br />\ndetermine the long-range relationship between Hopkins and the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory.<br />\nBut he also noted, \"If he<br />\n[Richardson] is as good as everbody says he is, we should be in<br />\ngood shape.\"<br />\nWolman finally noted that he is<br />\nthe chairman for the provost<br />\nsearch committee. He cited four<br />\nmain issues the new provost will<br />\nhave to work on with President<br />\nRichardson.<br />\nFirst, he will have to continue<br />\nfocusing on the ongoing financial<br />\ncondition of the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences.<br />\nHe must determine what the<br />\nrole of undergraduates and the<br />\nArts and Sciences in the greater<br />\nHopkins framework should be.<br />\nHe will also have to help determine the permanent role of the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory,and he<br />\nwill have to work to promote interdivisional cooperation among<br />\nthe different schools at Hopkins.<br />\nWolman said that there was no<br />\nstudent input in selecting the last<br />\nprovost and was unsure whether<br />\nthere would be any student input<br />\nthis time.<br />\n<br />\nTitit-<br />\n<br />\ni2spri To DETAIL<br />\nOF<br />\nP<br />\nLACE<br />\nITEIll<br />\n300417 TO /veld<br />\n93Pfl TO LOS Yopic<br />\n<br />\n)0Ati TO NE41 ANGELES<br />\n6P11 TO NEld YORK<br />\nN<br />\nYORK<br />\n6All TO<br />\nN<br />\n7PM TO SAN<br />\nCLEVELAND<br />\nPP; TO NE*41 \"AN<br />\nOH'<br />\nCA<br />\nYORK<br />\nPrI ro DALLAS<br />\nNY ii<br />\n)fl<br />\nTO<br />\nTx<br />\ntl TO<br />\nPALtiseAcH<br />\nFL<br />\nll<br />\n<br />\nArlouNT<br />\nS.30<br />\nitt \u2022 50<br />\n<br />\n6'RIGANTINE NJ<br />\nCHICAGO<br />\n'I TO Nt41<br />\nTO<br />\nIL<br />\ni To<br />\nNtlil YORK<br />\nNY<br />\nYORK<br />\n' To ti/NN<br />\na<br />\nNY<br />\nNEIII<br />\nTO<br />\n2<br />\nInv<br />\nYORK<br />\n447<br />\npHTLA<br />\nro P<br />\nNY 2<br />\nTO A HILA<br />\nPA 2 e<br />\nTO P LBANY<br />\nPA 2<br />\nro NEHILA<br />\nAlY<br />\ns<br />\n-141<br />\nPA<br />\nYORK<br />\n21<br />\n<br />\n41:23<br />\n2.45<br />\nCONTINur,<br />\n<br />\nJournalism<br />\ncrucified<br />\nAPPLE, from 2<br />\ncarn---Paigns.

McColl<br />\n<br />\nUndermined CUS needs raison d'etre<br />\nThere's a lot in this week's News-Letter about the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, and many of you may<br />\nbe wondering what the big deal is. The big deal is this:<br />\nThe CUS is potentially the most powerful student influence<br />\non Homewood's academic policies, and several recent<br />\nevents have undermined its authority.<br />\nThe CUS exists primarily as a vehicle for students, faculty and administrators to air grievances about academic<br />\npolicy and to propose possible solutions. Proposals accepted by the CUS are then presented to the Academic<br />\nCouncil for final consideration. Particularly for students,<br />\nthe CUS represents the main means to forming the policies<br />\nwhich directly affect them.<br />\nThe CUS, which is composed of both students and faculty, has impressively served the student body's needs and<br />\ndesires. The Pass/Fail option has been kept alive by the<br />\nCUS, as was the current Add/Drop deadline and policies.<br />\nLast year, however, the Deans of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering ignored the rebuff the CUS delivered to their<br />\nproposal for a B.A. degree in Engineering, and took it to<br />\nthe Academic Council despite the CUS's ruling.(Note that<br />\nstudents must go through the CUS to initiate debate,<br />\nwhereas deans and faculty may directly approach the<br />\nAcademic Council, even about matters concerning the<br />\nundergraduate population.)<br />\nAny previous authority the CUS had earned was<br />\nobliterated by the Deans' gesture and the Academic Council's acceptance of it. As Jeff De Cagna points out, a precedent has now been set for the administration to simply ignore the students' only voice in the academic decision making process.<br />\nOn top of this insult, the Academic Council, of which<br />\nthe CUS is a subcommittee, has dictated that at least one<br />\nof the four students on the CUS must be from the School<br />\nof Engineering, and one must be from Arts and Sciences.<br />\nObviously, in an ideal world all groups\u2014engineering,<br />\nnatural sciences, humanities, poly sci, et al.\u2014should be<br />\nrepresented in the CUS. But it's also important that the<br />\nfour representatives be highly committed people who are<br />\naware of current policies as well as the desires of the community. To find a student from Engineering or Arts and<br />\nSciences to simply fulfill the Academic Council's mandate is unacceptable: the CUS should remain a meritocracy<br />\nof sorts. Deans and faculty from each school should, instead, encourage students to become involved in forming<br />\ntheir own destinies. The CUS has the potential to become<br />\na visible and vocal part of the University.<br />\n<br />\nthrobbing head pain, and bloody<br />\nnoses also happen to be symptoms of such ailments as brain lesions and cerebral hemorrhages.<br />\nIn a recent government study, in<br />\nfact, the bulk of money donated<br />\nto televangelists was found to<br />\nhave come from sinus victims,<br />\nwho were told that sometimes<br />\nquote \"God seeth His Divine way<br />\nclear to squeezeth the heads of his<br />\nbeloved into marmalade\"<br />\n'unquote.<br />\nThe fact of the matter is that<br />\nsinusitis isn't all that painful or<br />\nunpleasant, it's just annoying. A<br />\ncouple of aspirin will take care of<br />\nthe headache, and you get used<br />\nto the sound checks after a while.<br />\nThe awful thing about sinus trouble is going to the doctor because<br />\nall doctors fall into the category<br />\nof people who look you up and<br />\ndown and say \"Yeah, so?\" Also,<br />\nalthough doctors would never admit it, studies of sinusitis have<br />\ncaused no improvements since<br />\naround the Battle of Hastings,<br />\nwhen soldiers with sinus infections were treated by having<br />\nleeches placed over their nostrils<br />\nto suck out the phlegm. This<br />\nhelped in only precious few<br />\ncases, however, and many patients came out of treatment looking very silly.<br />\nAs a result, nowadays, the<br />\nprescribed treatment is for doctors to press on that section of the<br />\nface just below the eyes until the<br />\npatient's eyeball pops out into the<br />\ndoctor's hand. At this point the<br />\ndoctor should ask, \"Does it hurt<br />\nwhen I do that?\" The patient will<br />\nof course be unable to answer<br />\nbecause he will have just died of<br />\na cerebral hemorrhage, thus<br />\nenabling the doctor to perform a<br />\ntechnique delicately labeled<br />\n\"sinus scraping,\" used before the<br />\nleech advancements of 1066(having never made it up to the<br />\neyeball popping part, I have no<br />\nidea what occurs here, although<br />\nI have a pretty clear picture in my<br />\nmind involving dentist's implements), and put them on<br />\n<br />\nI'm sick as a dog. As two dogs.<br />\nSicker than two dogs. I'm probably sicker than a litterful of<br />\nDobermans with kennel cough.<br />\nI've got a sinus infection. A<br />\nsinus infection is one of those<br />\nthings where if you tell someone<br />\nabout it and they've had one, they<br />\nimmediately send large black<br />\nfloral arrangements to your folks,<br />\nwhile if you tell someone and<br />\nthey've never had one, they just<br />\nlook you up and down and say,<br />\n\"Yeah, so?\"<br />\nThe sinusitis sufferer appears<br />\nnormal to all observers, except<br />\nfor a nauseous smile that crosses<br />\nhis or her face while speaking.<br />\nThis is because what the observer<br />\nhears as the victim's everyday<br />\nspeaking voice sounds to the<br />\nsinusitis victim like a microphone<br />\ncheck into the mouth of a subterranean cavern.<br />\nThe sinuses are apparently a<br />\nnetwork of tiny tubes that run<br />\nthrough the nose, around the<br />\neyes, into the ears and back<br />\nthrough the head, ending<br />\nsomewhere in Dubuque. They<br />\nserve no purpose that I can<br />\ndiscern, although in periods of intense weather flux, they do<br />\nbecome a sort of \"Natural<br />\nBarometer,\" barometric pressure<br />\nbeing determined by the level of<br />\nphlegm accumulating within<br />\nthem. This accumulation is then<br />\nturned to liquid cement by the<br />\nbody's defenses, and any subsequent phlegm trying to work its<br />\nway into the same sinuses will<br />\nsimply surround the blockage and<br />\nbegin throbbing the drum beat to<br />\nBarry Manilow's \"Copacabana\"<br />\non the inside of the victim's head.<br />\nSinusitis victims often have the<br />\nsensation of being \"stuffed up,\"<br />\nlike when you have a cold. But,<br />\nthere is nothing in your nose, only your sinuses, so blowing<br />\ndoesn't help. Although, if you<br />\nblow hard enough, you can give<br />\nyourself a bloody nose. It is for<br />\nthis precise reason that sinusitis<br />\nis a bad thing for hypochondriacs<br />\nto develop, as hearing trouble, See PUNCH, 9<br />\n<br />\nLet's have a re-election<br />\nThe controversy surrounding the Student Council presidential elections this past week has been a combination of both<br />\nencouraging and discouraging portents.<br />\nCouncil's overwhelming support for another run-off, in<br />\nlight of serious allegations of electoral impropriety, was<br />\na positive step. We are encouraged that the Council takes<br />\nitself seriously enough to stand on principle and call for<br />\nsuch a move, despite the inconvenience that another election will entail. Better yet, the Council managed to retain<br />\nits composure at this Wednesday's meeting, when its<br />\nrenegade Board of Elections chose to ignore Council's<br />\nstrong recommendation for a new vote. The Director of<br />\nStudent Activities, Bill Smedick, will decide this morning whether to override the Board's ruling on behalf of<br />\nCouncil. We hope Smedick will do so.<br />\nThe Board of Election's posturing this week is perplexing. There is little question that there were numerous opportunities for ballot-stuffing, and that the electoral process was seriously mismanaged. One would expect that<br />\nthe Board, whose very purpose is to avoid such behavior,<br />\nwould embrace the opportunity to hold another election<br />\nand to redeem itself. For whatever reason, this has regrettably not been the case. Questions about electoral validity<br />\ncan only hurt the candidates and the Student Council.<br />\nThroughout the year, the Student Council has conducted<br />\nitself with admirable dignity and self-respect. The importance of such a demeanor cannot be underestimated during a time in which the University is in considerable flux.<br />\nA decision to hold another run-off election could only increase the undergraduates' credibility. Those who have<br />\nsuggested that the need to hold another election would<br />\nundermine Council's prestige are completely wrong. On<br />\nthe contrary: holding another election would be a powerful gesture in favor of competence and integrity.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nMind/Brain<br />\n<br />\nThe punchline is this: sinus says<br />\n<br />\nAs one of the few committees composed of both faculty<br />\nand students, the CUS could also become an effective watchdog over academic policies concerning undergraduates,<br />\nand the University as a whole. The action taken by the<br />\nDeans to usurp the CUS's authority undermines the committee's legitimacy. The CUS has proven itself a necessary<br />\nand effective body, but it needs and deserves a defined<br />\npurpose to develop to its fullest potential.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nTwo weeks ago, the<br />\nMind/Brain Institute and Johns<br />\nHopkins University made known<br />\ntheir intention of moving the Institute into Rowland Hall. This is<br />\ndefinitely an improvement over<br />\nthe cramped quarters currently<br />\noccupied by the Mind/Brain Institute in Jenkins Hall. The completion of the new Physics<br />\nbuilding will allow the Physics<br />\ndepartment to vacate Rowland<br />\nHall, allowing for the Mind/Brain<br />\nInstitute to move in and share the<br />\npremises with the Mathematics<br />\nDepartment. I am certain that<br />\nmany advances will now be possible in the field of Brain Science,<br />\nespecially due to the generous gift<br />\nof $7.5 million by Mr. Zanvyl<br />\nKrieger (Class of '28).<br />\nThese changes are not only<br />\nnecessary, but also beneficial to<br />\nall parties involved. However,<br />\nthere is one consequence that I<br />\nhave failed to mention so far.<br />\nBy virtue of the contribution<br />\nMr. Krieger has made to the<br />\nUniversity, it has been decided<br />\nthat Rowland Hall should be<br />\nrenamed Krieger Hall. This is utterly unsatisfactory.<br />\nHenry Augustus Rowland was<br />\na member of the first faculty of<br />\nthis University. His contribution<br />\nto Physics at Hopkins are of the<br />\nsame magnitude as those of Ira<br />\nRemsen to Hopkins Chemistry.<br />\nHow can the name of Rowland be<br />\nremoved from the names that<br />\ngrace the Upper Quad'? Gilman,<br />\nAmes, Mergenthaler, Remsen,<br />\nEisenhower, and . . . Krieger?<br />\nOf course, the contribution of<br />\nMr. Krieger should not be<br />\noverlooked. Why not name the<br />\nMind/Brain Institute for its<br />\nbenefactor? In fact, the \"Krieger<br />\nMind/Brain Institute\" in<br />\nRowland Hall sounds much more<br />\nsatisfying, and it is ultimately<br />\nmore appropriate also. For it was<br />\nthe Institute that was enlivened by<br />\nMr. Krieger, not the building in<br />\nwhich it will be housed.<br />\nI appeal to the University to<br />\nreconsider the injustice it is about<br />\n<br />\nto inflict on the namesake of<br />\nRowland Hall, since he does<br />\nbelong on one of the main quads<br />\nalong with the other pioneers of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nChetan U. Kharod<br />\n<br />\nParsley, Part II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFour weeks ago I wrote a letter concerning President Bush's<br />\nvisit to Hopkins. In the following<br />\nissue, four letters were published in response. If the News-Letter<br />\nwill allow, I would like to comment on some of the accusations<br />\nthat were made.<br />\nAccusation #1: Elliot Yasnovsky claims that I \"felt that the<br />\ndemonstration<br />\n...<br />\nwas<br />\npointless.\" This is not true. I only<br />\nstated that the protest would have<br />\nbeen more effective if it had been<br />\nfocused against the people who<br />\nchose Bush as an honorary degree<br />\nrecipient.<br />\nAccusation #2: Mr. Yasnovsky<br />\nclaims that I have been \"misled<br />\nby misconceptions\" about Bush.<br />\nIt is stupid of him to make this<br />\nclaim when our letters agree that<br />\nBush is not doing enough to improve health care.<br />\n<br />\nAccusation #3: Mr. Yasnovsky<br />\nclaims that I neglect my political<br />\nrights and \"want others to neglect<br />\ntheirs as well.\" Did my letter say<br />\nanything that any intelligent person would interpret this way? No.<br />\nIs this accusation stupid'? Yes.<br />\nAccusation #4: Don Kuchy<br />\nclaims that I \"call protest an act<br />\nof stupidity.\" He also claims that<br />\nby holding this opinion I want to<br />\ndeny others their constitutional<br />\nrights of protest and participation<br />\nin political issues. Again, I only<br />\nstated that the protest should have<br />\nbeen focused in a different direction. Mr. Kuchy has the right to<br />\nwrite zealous attacks against me<br />\nif he wishes, but I wish he<br />\nweren't so stupid about it. I also<br />\nwish he wouldn't make stuff up.<br />\nAccusation #5: Mr. Kuchy<br />\nclaims that it is irrelevant that<br />\nover 90 percent of the Panamanian people supported the<br />\ninvasion of their country. He<br />\nstates, \"The number of Panamanian lives lost reaffirms the fact<br />\nthat Bush is a butcher.\" Does this<br />\nmean that Roosevelt is a butcher<br />\nfor the D-Day invasion'? You are<br />\nwrong Mr. Kuchy, and over 90<br />\npercent of Panama agrees with<br />\nme.<br />\nAccusation #6: Two letters<br />\nclaimed that Bush is indeed a thief<br />\n(I claimed that he wasn't in my<br />\n<br />\nHarassment<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWith all the recent debate concerning discrimination and intolerance on campus, I am compelled to relate an experience I<br />\nSee LETTERS, 8<br />\n<br />\n\"ryk.<br />\ntie PfrkrAL.<br />\n<br />\nYEARi,<br />\n(Of/NS<br />\n<br />\nAndrew Parsley<br />\n<br />\n(AST'RuCT,olv 00<br />\n<br />\n10 1194-R oF IS<br />\n74<br />\n<br />\nletter), and examples of how his<br />\npolicies\u2014or lack thereof\u2014<br />\nconstituted thievery. I agree with<br />\nthe substance of many of these<br />\ncriticisms, but I hardly think that<br />\ndisagreements over policy justify<br />\nthe term \"thief.\" Also, both letters blame Bush for problems<br />\nwhich began long before he<br />\nbecame president. If we were to<br />\nblame Bush for everything that<br />\nhas gone wrong in the past year,<br />\ndo we also give him credit for<br />\neverything that has gone right?<br />\nDo we give him credit for the end<br />\nof the Cold War'?<br />\nAccusation #7: Kay Carter<br />\nclaims that I was wrong when I<br />\ncriticized the Students for Environmental Action for participating in the protest (I claimed that they were alienating<br />\nRepublicans). After reading her<br />\nletter, I must say that she is correct.

The CUS<br />\nis, arguably, the most important<br />\nstudent-populated university<br />\ncommittee. Student members<br />\nhave the ability to influence<br />\nacademic policy directly by<br />\nrepresenting student body concerns at a level where they can<br />\nhave an impact. Additionally,<br />\nstudents may initiate changes in<br />\nacademic policy by submitting<br />\noriginal proposals for committee<br />\nconsideration. Finally, the student<br />\nmembers of the CUS have the<br />\npower to vote on all proposed<br />\ncommittee actions. In short, this<br />\nframework provides students with<br />\na significant opportunity to influence the system. (It is important to add at this juncture that all<br />\nactions of the CUS must be approved by the Academic Council,<br />\nof which the former is a standing<br />\ncommittee.)<br />\nAs a member of this committee, I utilized my resources to<br />\ntheir fullest extent. I submitted<br />\nproposals designed to offer<br />\nstudents more academic choices.<br />\nI vigorously defended the student<br />\npoint of view on controversial<br />\nissues like the Add/Drop and the<br />\nelimination of the Pass/Fail option. And I utilized my membership on the CUS to help set in<br />\nmotion the progress of helping<br />\nforeign teaching assistants with<br />\ntheir English language proficiency. My purpose in detailing my<br />\npersonal CUS accomplishments<br />\nis to illustrate that I took my participation on this committee very<br />\nseriously. At every CUS meeting,<br />\nI believed (and still do believe)<br />\nthat I was representing the student<br />\nbody, working for the good of all<br />\nstudents, regardless of the issue.<br />\nThe harsh reality\u2014the reality<br />\nwhich, in part, prompted my<br />\nresignation from Student Council and the CUS at the start of this<br />\nacademic year\u2014was that the student voice on the CUS was not<br />\nas important as I had been led to<br />\nbelieve. This fact was brought into focus by an incident which<br />\ncame to my attention during the<br />\nsummer. Last spring, the CUS<br />\nconsidered a proposal concerning<br />\na B.A. degree in Engineering,<br />\nsubmitted by the Whiting School.<br />\nThe CUS rejected the proposal on<br />\nboth philosophical and intellectual<br />\ngrounds on two separate occasions. At its final meeting of the<br />\nyear, this same proposal was submitted directly to the Academic<br />\nCouncil, which approved it, over<br />\nand above the objections of the<br />\nCUS membership. The moral of<br />\nthis story is that the student body<br />\nis being shortchanged on the<br />\nCUS. The Committee on<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduate Studies existed, i n<br />\nmy mind, to offer students a real<br />\nopportunity to be involved in the<br />\nformulation of academic policy.<br />\nIn fact, in its current form, it is<br />\na sham, governed not by formal<br />\nrules, but by the whims of the<br />\nA&S and Engineering deans. If<br />\nstudent input on a proposal is not<br />\ndeemed worthy it can be cast<br />\naside. Clearly, even a formal vote<br />\nof this body does not necessarily<br />\ncarry any weight!<br />\nIn my opinion, the student body<br />\nand its elected representatives, the<br />\nStudent Council, should not<br />\ncountenance these developments.<br />\nThe precedent for ignoring the<br />\nstudent voice in the future has<br />\nbeen firmly established. Imagine<br />\nif the deans had taken their radical<br />\nAdd/Drop proposal of two years<br />\nago directly to the Academic<br />\nCouncil after the CUS had soundly rejected it? Or if they had moved to eliminate the Pass/Fail option without even consulting the<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 FREE PREGNANCY TESTING<br />\n\u2022 ABORTION SERVICES<br />\n\u2022 BIRTH CONTROL SERVICES<br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br />\n<br />\n788-4400<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 SONOGRAMS<br />\n\u2022 COUNSELING<br />\n\u2022 COMMUNITY EDUCATION<br />\n<br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n830 5 PO p In<br />\n<br />\n4111i<br />\n<br />\n5602 Baltimore National Pike *600<br />\n<br />\nV.<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nMAJORING IN<br />\nAllied Health Professions<br />\n<br />\nDiscover a challenging,<br />\n$<br />\n141.11141\u2018<br />\nrewarding future that puts<br />\nyou in touch with your skills.<br />\nToday's Air Force offers ongoing<br />\nopportunities for professional<br />\ndevelopment with great pay and<br />\nbenefits, normal working hours,<br />\ncomplete medical and dental care,<br />\nand 30 days vacation with pay per<br />\nyear.

This<br />\nis a concept which has finally arrived. Two commentators, one<br />\nweather board, one world. All on<br />\nyour television screen. We have<br />\nto admit, at first we were a little<br />\nskeptical of the idea. Twenty-four<br />\nhours a day of Marty Bass? It<br />\nseemed too much for even the<br />\nmost jaded viewer. Yet after watching for a while, it became clear<br />\nto us that this channel deserves<br />\nspecial recognition.<br />\nWhen you wake up in the morning and find that it's pouring rain<br />\nin Baltimore, it's comforting to<br />\nturn on the Weather Channel. A<br />\nquick look reveals that the<br />\nweather's bad all over. There's<br />\na hurricane in the Caribbean.<br />\nTornado warnings are in effect<br />\nfor most of the Midwest. A small<br />\ntremor has hit the California<br />\ncoast. Two anchorpeople sequestered behind a desk calmly<br />\npresent you with all of the news.<br />\n; Suddenly it is easy to feel that you<br />\n\u2022<br />\nare part of a large community.<br />\nC Everybody has something in<br />\n\u2022 common . . . the weather. If it's<br />\nsnowing in Seattle, we can feel<br />\nan affinity for everyone that has<br />\nt.o trudge to work. If it's sunny<br />\n,in Houston, Aunt Clara is pro!. bably working on her tan. There<br />\nis no banter or debate on the<br />\n6<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 Weather Channel. No one feels<br />\ncompelled to make a joke. There<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\ne IS just the weather and a few maps<br />\n\u2022<br />\nte bringing the country together.<br />\nThat's how it ought to be.<br />\nAll of this leads us to the<br />\nfishing shows on ESPN. Upon<br />\n<br />\ntuning in, the sports-hungry<br />\nviewer finds an unusually serene<br />\nsetting on his screen. It's early in<br />\nthe morning, and two old men are<br />\nin a boat discussing the merits of<br />\ndifferent baits. Frogs, small fish,<br />\nand flies are all examined. It's<br />\nstill a little dark out, but you can<br />\nsee that these two are experts.<br />\nThey have all of the right equipment and an air of confidence.<br />\nAfter a while they cast their lines<br />\nout over the water. Sh00000sh<br />\n. . . whrrrrrrr . . . pl00000sh. So<br />\nthey wait and chat a little. Maybe<br />\nthey'll catch something, maybe<br />\nthey won't. Every once in a<br />\nwhile, they reel their lines in and<br />\ndiscuss things some more. They<br />\nare never in a hurry. Somehow,<br />\nthey seem to understand that no<br />\nmatter what happens it has been<br />\na good day. After all, they're<br />\nfishing, aren't they?<br />\nIf there is a connection between<br />\nthese two forms of television, it<br />\nis in their uniqueness. It's<br />\nsoothing to watch old men out on<br />\na boat or satellite pictures of a nation. After a hard day of car<br />\nchases, violence, and formula endings maybe we can use the inevitable uncertainty of fishing and<br />\nthe weather. There just might be<br />\nan essential message contained in<br />\nthese concepts. With all of the<br />\ncomplex ideas that govern our<br />\nlives, maybe all it really comes<br />\ndown to is the temperature and<br />\nwhether or not the trout are<br />\nbiting. It is in these everyday occurrences that, if only for a moment, we may all have a chance<br />\nto come together.<br />\n<br />\nGrad Club<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing after having read<br />\nthe article about loud music and<br />\nthe Grad club in the News-Letter<br />\nof March 9. Both the University<br />\nand the Grad club have forgotten<br />\ntwo important facts. First, people have danced to unamplified<br />\nmusic for at least several thousand years. Second, amplified<br />\ndoes not have to be loud. The<br />\nanswer to the problems at the<br />\nGrad Club is simple: keep the<br />\nvolume reasonable. Use a sound<br />\nmeter, put a limit on it, and tell<br />\nthe bands to keep the amplification low enough so that it does not<br />\nexceed the desired level.<br />\nLet me compare two different<br />\nexperiences. The first is at the<br />\nGrad Club. We went there last<br />\nyear for a rock and roll band, and<br />\nfound the volume very loud. I<br />\nasked to have it turned down to<br />\na reasonable level, but was told<br />\nthat the band liked it loud, and<br />\nloud it was going to remain. The<br />\nsecond experience is at the dances<br />\nsponsored by the Washington<br />\nSwing Dance Society. They insist<br />\non having ultimate control of the<br />\nvolume, turn it down if the band<br />\nsets it too loud, and refuse to hire<br />\nbands that don't comply with<br />\ntheir policy.<br />\nLoud noise of any kind can be<br />\nobnoxious, interfering with other<br />\nactivities, and dangerous, producing a loss of hearing, the moral<br />\nis clear. Until bands become<br />\nresponsible and keep their<br />\nvolume at a reasonable level, the<br />\nUniversity/Grad Club should put<br />\na limit on it.<br />\nFinally, I hope the University<br />\ndoes not pursue the option of<br />\nfinding a place where the music<br />\ncan be as loud as the bands want<br />\nit. such a step would be unfortunate, because it would suggest<br />\nthat the University condones the<br />\nloud volume, and sanctions the<br />\nincreased risk of hearing loss.<br />\nDavid Olton<br />\nProfessor<br />\nSee LETTERS, 9<br />\n<br />\nLAST CHANCE<br />\nTHIS<br />\nSEMESTER!<br />\n<br />\nNext GRO meeting: Wed.,<br />\nApril 11 at 5:30pm - Executive<br />\nConference Room.<br />\nGRO meetings fbr the rest of<br />\nthe semester will be on April<br />\n25, May 9 both at 5:30 p.m.<br />\nand in the Executive Conference Room.<br />\n<br />\nGRAD CLUB<br />\nThe planned closure of the<br />\nGrad Club will not go ahead after<br />\nall. At a meeting with Dean of<br />\nStudents Susan K. Boswell, GRO<br />\nmembers Joanne Houlahan,<br />\nRalph El-Chami, Dan Ferber,<br />\nTammy Smecker and Scott<br />\nHolupka, along with Grad Club<br />\nmanager James Wesolowsky,<br />\nreached a compromise with the<br />\nJHU administration, in this instance represented by SAC<br />\nActivities Director Bill Smedick<br />\nand Finance Director Shelly<br />\nAlbrecht.<br />\nThe Club is to be soundproofed with acoustic ties which<br />\nit is hoped will absorb most of the<br />\nnoise emanating from the<br />\npremises. Admittedly, the<br />\npopular Funk Nite will no longer<br />\nbe held in the club, being moved<br />\ninstead to the Rat (the bit of the<br />\nLevering Cafeteria with the<br />\nplastic dome.) It is not as yet clear<br />\nwhether alcohol will be served.<br />\nHowever, there will still be live<br />\nbands on Friday nights and there<br />\nwill be a DJ on Saturdays. Asked whether she thought the<br />\ncompromise would satisfy<br />\nresidents of McCoy Hall,<br />\nBoswell said she didn't know.<br />\nThe club's new lease on life was<br />\nonly on a \"trial basis.\" cAnd if<br />\nthe McCoy residents still complain, there would be little option<br />\nbut to close the place down.<br />\nWith this in mind, there has<br />\nbeen talk of moving the Grad<br />\nClub, perhaps to the disused<br />\nbuilding at 3301 N. Charles,<br />\nwhich is due for renovation over<br />\nthe next two years. However,<br />\nBoswell said no conclusions had<br />\nbeen reached. And everyone in-<br />\n<br />\nvolved is still \"thinking about<br />\nit<br />\nMeanwhile, the band for<br />\ntonight, March 30, is the Delta<br />\nDevils.<br />\nSo check out the club - it'll be<br />\nrockin' as usual.<br />\nGRO NOTES<br />\nAt its last meeting (Mar. 7), the<br />\nGRO heard various funding and<br />\nrecognition requests.<br />\nA delegate, Alan Barta, from<br />\nthe Hopkins chapter of Student<br />\nPugwash, U.S.A. (SPUSA) addressed the council, seeking GRO<br />\nrecognition for the Hopkins<br />\norganization. Pugwash is, he explained, an educational group<br />\ndedicated to generating interest in<br />\nthe ethical and social implications<br />\nof science and technology. The<br />\ncouncil unanimously voted to<br />\ngrant GRO recognition to the<br />\nHopkins group.<br />\nColin Vaughan, the chair of the<br />\nJHU Caribbean Interest Group<br />\n(CIG), presented a request to the<br />\ncouncil that the GRO co-sponsor<br />\na Hoppy Hour with CIG, splitting<br />\ncosts 50-50. The GRO cosponsored such an event with Clg<br />\nlast year. It was agreed to cosponsor the event to the amount<br />\nof $300.<br />\nThe Union of Jewish Graduate<br />\nStudents (JGS) presented a request for a continuation of the<br />\nfunding they received from the<br />\nGRO last semester. The principal<br />\nrequest was for funding for the<br />\ngroup's lecture series, which<br />\ndrew much campus press last<br />\nsemester. The series will consist<br />\nof six lectures, each costing $70<br />\nin honoraria. Including printing<br />\ncosts, the full extent of the<br />\nUJGS's financial needs for this<br />\nsemester is $595, though the<br />\ngroup made plain they were not<br />\nnecessarily asking the GRO for<br />\nthis amount. Nonetheless, there<br />\nwas some concern among the<br />\ncouncil members that to fund the<br />\nUJGS by too great an extent<br />\nwould be to set an unfortunate<br />\nprecedent for future petitioners to<br />\ntake heed of. A compromise<br />\nfigure of $250 was suggested.<br />\n<br />\nThis proposal was accepted by a<br />\nvote of 8-3.<br />\nTwo JHU Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance (GALA) officers<br />\npresented a funding request for<br />\n$200 to help defray the costs of<br />\nthe screening of two films in<br />\nApril (the 6th and 26th, tentatively). The petitioners said that grad<br />\ninterest in the Alliance was high,<br />\nespecially for its discussion<br />\ngroups. The council unanimously granted the $200.<br />\nLemniscate, a JHU literary<br />\nmagazine, presented a request for<br />\n$1000 for support with its spring<br />\n1990 edition. Council member<br />\nScott Holupka said that it seems<br />\nthat only three or four grads are<br />\ninvolved. GRO Co-Chair Joanne<br />\nHoulahan noted that seeing as<br />\nhow the magazine seems to be<br />\ndominated by Writing Seminars<br />\nmajors, and the GRO already<br />\ncontributes quite a lot to the<br />\nWriting Sems reading series, it<br />\nmight appear unseemly for the<br />\ncouncil essentially to subsidize<br />\none department by such a large<br />\namount. Secretary Munro and<br />\nMr. Holupka raised some questions as to why Lemniscate's<br />\nprinting costs ($4000) were so<br />\nhigh. Mr. Munro noted that<br />\nreducing point size might reduce<br />\nthe size of the booklet by a third,<br />\nsaving a large sum. Ms.<br />\nHoulahan suggested that the GRO<br />\nask the publishers for an exact<br />\nbreakdown of how the $4000 is<br />\nto be spent. The decision to fund<br />\nwas postponed pending.<br />\n<br />\nEditor: Doug Munro<br />\nUnless otherwise stated, the<br />\nviews expressed herein do not<br />\nrepresent the official position<br />\nof the GRO.<br />\nPlease submit all letters and<br />\narticles to the editor's mailbox<br />\nin Political Science by 5 p.m.<br />\nMondays.

This is a<br />\nquestion which I cannot answer.<br />\nI resigned from the Council partly<br />\nbecause of this event and partly<br />\nbecause I lacked the burning<br />\ndesire to tackle this problem. Furthermore, I realized that, as a<br />\n<br />\ngraduating senior, I should step<br />\naside and allow others with more<br />\nto gain\u2014and perhaps more to<br />\nlose\u2014to solve the problem in<br />\ntheir own way. I am therefore<br />\nhopeful that current and future<br />\nstudent leaders\u2014Student Council<br />\npresidents, class presidents and<br />\nrepresentatives, Education Committee Chairmen and CUS atlarge members\u2014will step forward and make their feelings on<br />\nthis subject known and take action to correct existing problems,<br />\nas always, for the sake of the<br />\nstudents.<br />\n<br />\nby Jack Horn<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nSilverstein<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI feel particularly compelled to<br />\nrespond to Mr. Silverstein's letter in the March 2nd issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter. First, let me clarify<br />\nmy remarks made at the Candidate's Forum. Mr. Silverstein<br />\nstates in his letter that I do not<br />\nrecognize racism and sexism as<br />\npotential problems at this school.<br />\nIf he were present at the Candidate's Forum, or, at the very<br />\nleast, gained some discussion<br />\nwith me'nor to writin his let-<br />\n<br />\nThe wolfman when the moon isn't quite full.by Rob Grofe<br />\n<br />\nAttention<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nStaff:<br />\n<br />\nter, he would know that what I<br />\nsaid was that climate issues such<br />\nas racism and sexism are problems too big for Council to handle. They are something better<br />\nsuited for organizations such as<br />\nthe Women's Center, BSU,<br />\nGALA, and the JSA. I believe<br />\nthat they, too, would agree with<br />\nthis conclusion. This is not to say,<br />\nhowever, that I would be unwilling to work with them. We have<br />\ncommon goals in that we are all<br />\ntrying to improve the quality of<br />\nstudent life here at Hopkins. Dr.<br />\nAshby's committee or any other<br />\nuniversity climate related concern<br />\nhas always and will certainly continue to have an opportunity to<br />\nvoice their opinions to Council.<br />\nMr. Silverstein is clearly being<br />\nunfair, however, to accuse this<br />\nentire campus of racist and sexist tendencies. He states that there<br />\nis an uncercurrent at this school<br />\nthat champions a racist/sexist<br />\nviewpoint. I must disagree with<br />\nthis assertion. Organizations such<br />\nas the BSU, JSA, GALA,and the<br />\nWomen's Center have made great<br />\nstrides in the three years I have<br />\nbeen here to avoid such a reality. I believe that this trend<br />\ntowards understanding will<br />\ncontinue.<br />\nThere is a misconception that<br />\n<br />\nit is the duty solely of Student<br />\nCouncil to cure the ills of the<br />\nUniversity. This view does not<br />\ngive other student groups enough<br />\ndeserved credit. I recognize and<br />\ntruly respect organizations that<br />\nactively try to improve student<br />\nlife and the overall climate of the<br />\nschool. Student Council is just<br />\none means to this end. There are<br />\nstudent organizations out there<br />\nwho are more qualified to deal<br />\nwith certain issues. That is the<br />\nlong and short of what I meant at<br />\nthe Candidate's Forum.<br />\nI believe that this letter clarifies<br />\nthe statements I made at the Candidate's Forum. I hope that future<br />\ncorrespondences involving my<br />\nviews on Council obtain them<br />\nmore responsibly.

Kern<br />\nSpalding Gray overturned the<br />\ncardboard box sitting on the table<br />\nin front of him, and out tumbled<br />\na bound manuscript that was<br />\nperhaps seven inches thick. \"This<br />\nis the monster,\" he said, explaining the title of his current<br />\nmonologue,\"Monster in a Box,\"<br />\nwhich he performed Saturday<br />\nnight as the first installment of the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art's \"Off<br />\nThe Walls\" contemporary performance series.<br />\nGray's 1400-page \"monster\"<br />\nis an autobiographical novel<br />\nentitled \"The Impossible Vacation,\" which he was commissioned to write approximately<br />\nthree years ago. But as both the<br />\nmonologue and the hulking<br />\nmanuscript made clear, Gray has<br />\nyet to finish the book. \"Monster<br />\nin a Box\" purports to explain<br />\nwhy. But Gray, interestingly,<br />\ndoesn't give away the subtext:<br />\nthat the monologue is itself<br />\nanother postponement device,<br />\ndiguised as a confession.<br />\nIn fact, Spalding Gray's thirteenth dramatic monlogue comes<br />\nacross almost like an apology\u2014<br />\nan adult's collection of excuses<br />\nfor homework not finished. Gray<br />\ncatalogs the diversions that drew<br />\n<br />\nMOV<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nhim eagerly away from his<br />\nwriter's desk: a trip to Nicaragua<br />\nto research a film script about<br />\nAmerican revolutionary tourists;<br />\nan invitation from a small theater<br />\ncompany to find and interview<br />\n\"people in Los Angeles who<br />\nweren't involved in the film industry\"; and a journey to the first<br />\nAmerican film festival in the<br />\nSoviet Union, where \"Swimming<br />\nto Cambodia\"(a film version of<br />\nan earlier monologue) played<br />\nalongside the likes of \"Splash,\"<br />\n\"The Empire Strikes Back,\" and<br />\n\"Cool Hand Luke.\"<br />\nFrom a stiff-backed chair<br />\nbehind a small card table, Gray<br />\nwarily unfolded the tale of his extended procrastination. Aside<br />\nfrom the manuscript and box, his<br />\nonly other companions on the<br />\nstage were a glass of water, a<br />\nsmall paperback book, and a<br />\nhighly sensitive microphone that<br />\nseemed to capture every sound he<br />\nmade. This seemed appropriate,<br />\nas Gray's narrative style is almost<br />\nabnormally intimate. He talks and<br />\ngestures as if addressing a single<br />\nperson seated right in front of<br />\nhim, even though many of the<br />\nhundreds at the sold-out performance sat over thirty yards from<br />\nthe stage. Miraculously, the<br />\nmethod works: Gray makes the<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\nintervening distance vanish, and<br />\nhis words travel with the weight<br />\nof shared secrets. The members<br />\nof tho audience become his<br />\nconfidants.<br />\nIt was appropriate for Gray to<br />\nseek confidants rather than a mere<br />\naudience, for \"Monster in a<br />\nBox,\" like many of its<br />\npredecesors, centers on Spalding<br />\nGray himself. The concept<br />\nsounds narcissistic, and perhaps<br />\nit is. But like Woody Allen in his<br />\nearly standup comedy routines,<br />\nGray often uses self-adsorption as<br />\nan excuse to examine larger<br />\nissues.<br />\nWhen in Los Angeles, he<br />\nobserves that everyone has a<br />\n\"thirty-five-mile-an-hour consciousness\"\u2014everybody drives<br />\nand nobody walks, with the result<br />\nthat people are almost oblivious<br />\nto their environment. Gray<br />\nsimilarly magnifies the nation's<br />\nAIDS panic into a personal<br />\n\"AIDS hysteria,\" triggered by<br />\nhis girlfriend's discovery of a<br />\nfestering \"spider bite\" one morning. While in Nicaragua, he<br />\nlistens to the horror stories of<br />\nmothers whose children have<br />\nbeen killed be the Contras.<br />\nUnaware of the group's main<br />\nsource of income\u2014American<br />\naid\u2014one pleads with him, \"Tell<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\n'Oscar and Me'<br />\nA Movie Critic in Front of the TV<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nSad to report, there weren't any<br />\nmajor mishaps on Monday<br />\nnight's Academy Awards.

In<br />\nan industry that hardly needed an<br />\nego boost, Oscar is now a selfproclaimed Cold War-killer and<br />\nworld-shrinker. Apparently hundreds of Eastern Europeans were<br />\ntaking a break from their busy<br />\nschedule of creating democracies<br />\nto watch Randy Newman sint<br />\ntheme from \"Parenthood.\"<br />\nThere were low-quality remote<br />\npresentaitons from around the<br />\nglobe.

He flew<br />\nto Buenos Aires that day so there<br />\ncould be a fifth location. They've<br />\nbeen really starved for entertainment in Argentina since \"Evita\"<br />\nclosed.

Although Gray's stock<br />\nin trade is finding and exploiting<br />\nlife's absurdities, and the absurdities of people in particular, he<br />\ndoesn't esteem himself any higher<br />\nthan his prey\u2014unless, of course,<br />\n<br />\nwas nothing compared to the<br />\noutrage voiced this year by critics<br />\nand movie-goers over the omission of Spike Lee's \"Do the<br />\nRight Thing\" and the Spielberglike snub of \"Driving Miss<br />\nDaisy\" director Bruce Beresford.<br />\nMany of the presentors and recipients decided to take matters into<br />\ntheir own hands.<br />\nRace relations expert Kim Basinger certainly ruined her chances<br />\nof receiving the Thalberg<br />\nLifetime Achievement Award<br />\nwith her patronizing homily to<br />\nSpike Lee before introducing best<br />\npicture nominee \"Dead Poets<br />\nSociety.\" Denzel Washington,<br />\naccepting his best suporting actor award for \"Glory,\" called<br />\n<br />\n'True to Oscar<br />\nform, no awards<br />\nwere given out<br />\nin the first<br />\nhalf hour.<br />\nnicely done, although it was hard<br />\nto explain why the day-glo clad<br />\nscuba-divers were tap dancing.<br />\nAbdul's grotesque version of<br />\nthe best costume category,<br />\nhowever, may have set a new<br />\nOscar low.

The costume mam-<br />\n<br />\nLike most great storytellers,<br />\nGray has the ability to make truth<br />\nrelative\u2014to bend or stretch facts<br />\nuntil they fit snugly into the structure of his tale. So entrancing is<br />\nhis narrative style, so compelling<br />\nare his characters, that the listener<br />\nis willing to follow him almost<br />\nanywhere. And true to form,<br />\n\"Monster in a Box\" did seem to<br />\ntravel everywhere during its ninety minutes.<br />\n<br />\nThe narrative leapt from New<br />\nYork City to Bali to Moscow to<br />\nLos Angeles to New Hampshire,<br />\nhopping years and juggling the<br />\nperspectives of dozens of<br />\ncharacters. Shifting between<br />\ndescriptions of the protagonist in<br />\nhis book and some partly fictionalized episodes from real life,<br />\nGray reported the difficulty he<br />\nhad in attempting to write in New<br />\nHampshire's McDowell Colony<br />\n(in a cabin called the Bates<br />\nHouse). Soon after writer's block<br />\nset in, excuses to escape the<br />\ntypewriter began to converge on<br />\nhim: First the grant project, the<br />\n\"idea lunches\" with various<br />\nHollywood executives, followed<br />\nby the trip to Nicaragua and a<br />\nchaotic string of events there.<br />\nSee MONOLOGUE, 14<br />\n<br />\nTHE A TER<br />\n<br />\nBarnstormers' Latest<br />\nSurmounts Its<br />\nScriptural Mediocrity<br />\nby Paul Bonanos<br />\n<br />\n'Henry V was<br />\ndoing backflips<br />\nand Valmont<br />\nwas vogueing.'<br />\nthat omitted film \"certainly one<br />\nof the best five films of the year.\"<br />\nAnd everyone associated with<br />\nwith the four Oscars from \"Driving Miss Daisy\" effusively<br />\nthanked Beresford.

Meanwhile,<br />\nHenry V was doing back flips and<br />\nValmont was vogueing.<br />\nIn another worldly and bizarre<br />\nOscar moment, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa was<br />\nhonored with a lifetime achievement award. Although one<br />\ncouldn't tell if he was laughing or<br />\ncrying, his words were<br />\nmemorable. Kurosawsa, who has<br />\nmade dozens of films and whose<br />\ncareer spans four decades, wasn't<br />\nsure if he deserved the award<br />\n\"because I don't feel I understand<br />\ncinema.\" And who says those<br />\nhumble, hardworking Japanese<br />\ncan't teach us a thing or two?<br />\n<br />\nAs the telecast steamrollered to<br />\na crescendo, with no more best<br />\nsong nominees or technical<br />\nawards to be handed out, the<br />\ndrama actually was palpable.<br />\nWould Spike Lee receive the<br />\nscreenwriting consolation prize?<br />\nNo, he didn't win, but the winner was sitting in his row.

Would Oliver<br />\nStone sweat uncontrollably upon<br />\nreceiving the best director award,<br />\nas he did in 1986? No, he was<br />\ntanned, rested, and ready.<br />\nSo much for suspense. In fact,<br />\nSO much for the Academy<br />\nAwards show. What's one billion<br />\nminus one'?<br />\n<br />\nHow does a nice Jewish boy<br />\nfrom the city realize his dream of<br />\nbecoming an actor? This is the<br />\nfundamental question tackled in<br />\n\"Enter Laughing,\" the latest<br />\nBarnstormers production, which<br />\nplayed in the Arellano theatre<br />\nMarch 9 through 11.<br />\nDirected by Steve Mager and<br />\nRhoda Charles and produced by<br />\n\"Enter<br />\nMcColl,<br />\nChris<br />\nLaughing\" traces the path of<br />\nyoung David Kolowitz, fresh out<br />\nof high school and apprenticing<br />\nin carpentry at a neighborhood<br />\nbusiness, to his ultimate dream of<br />\nacting in the theatre. Art Interian,<br />\nas David, is eminently likable if<br />\nnot extraordinary; his portrayal as<br />\na nervous young man facing auditions, rehearsals, and women for<br />\nthe first time carries a delightful<br />\nschtick. And although David<br />\nrarely transcends such schtick,<br />\neven in his tensest moments, the<br />\nlaughs he manages to incite are<br />\ngenuine and loud. His companion, Marvin, from a similar<br />\nbackground and played by Ben<br />\nTownsend, seems less comfortable with his part but acts as a<br />\nperfect foil.<br />\nDavid begins working as a simple carpenter in a shop for the<br />\naptly named Mr. Foreman. He<br />\nsoon becomes inspired to take<br />\nnight acting school which, for a<br />\ncompletely inexperienced actor,<br />\ncan be pretty frightening, as<br />\nDavid discovers the hard way. He<br />\nmanages, however, to swallow<br />\nsome pride and overcome his<br />\nfears\u2014barely\u2014to muster an audition, where he is chosen for the<br />\npart by leading lady Angela<br />\nMarlowe, despite his more-thanobvious inabilities. Angela(Susan<br />\nPlano) interacts with David<br />\nperfectly, as her efforts to relax<br />\nhim for their love scenes<br />\n<br />\nbackfire, causing only more<br />\nnerves for poor David. These efforts are, predictably, misinterpreted by David's sweetheart<br />\nWanda (Adrienne Lamb), whose<br />\nchemistry with Interian is executed with fine aplomb.<br />\n\"Enter Laughing\" is a comedy, after all, and its funniest<br />\nmoments are largely contained in<br />\nthe slapstick of David's botched<br />\nrehearsals. But the real comic<br />\nshow-stealers are Dave Howe and<br />\nRebecca Garron, who are obviously well rehearsed as the<br />\nstereotypical, bickering, overworrying Kolowitz parents. Their<br />\nrapid-fire conversations and taut<br />\ncontrol evidence true comic talent<br />\nwhile creating a pair of highly<br />\nbelievable characters.<br />\nYet the play's more serious<br />\nmoments are handled quite<br />\ncapably as well. David and<br />\nWanda's sorrowful near breakup<br />\nand subsequent reconciliation<br />\narouse genuine pathos, and the<br />\nbattles with his parents and their<br />\nattempt to remove him from acting school evoke a tangible sense<br />\nof disappointment.<br />\nOn the whole, though, \"Enter<br />\nLaughing\" seems to be like a cartoon with serious moments.<br />\nSlapstick humor, predictable endings, and basic sitcom ups and<br />\ndowns leave much room for the<br />\nplayers to make or break the performance. Its cartoonish nature is<br />\ncertainly positive, though; it adds<br />\nto the inherent humor in David's<br />\nplight. The ending, predictably,<br />\nresults in David's realization of<br />\nhis dream, but David's performance makes it entirely<br />\nbelievable. A well rehearsed,<br />\nwell supported cast is what<br />\nsalvages \"Enter Laughing\" from<br />\nits scriptual mediocrity and<br />\nelevates it to a truly enjoyable<br />\nlevel.<br />\n<br />\n\fRECORDS<br />\n<br />\nA Sweeping Survey\u2014<br />\nDepeche Mode, Nitzer<br />\nEbb, The Beloved<br />\nAnd The Blue Nile<br />\n<br />\nWANT TO BE<br />\nA PEER<br />\nCOUNSELOR?!<br />\nInformation session<br />\nTuesday, April 3<br />\n7:00 PM<br />\nAMR I TV Room<br />\n<br />\nby John H.

It's<br />\nwell-worn territory for Depeche<br />\nMode, of course, exploited to the<br />\nextreme on their \"Black Celebration\" LP, yet their pursuit of<br />\nemotional decay is tempered here<br />\nby something approaching insight, as on \"Halo,\" where<br />\nDavid Gahan sings, \"You wear<br />\nguilt like shackles on your feet,<br />\nlike a halo in reverse.\" Or<br />\n\"Clean\": \"As years go by, all<br />\nthe feelings inside twist and they<br />\nturn, as they ride with the tide.\"<br />\nIt's all delivered with a certain<br />\ncamp vigor that wavers between<br />\nbrooding humor and intense selfconsciousness, and backed by<br />\nsome extremely alluring<br />\n\"Eminently<br />\nmelodies.<br />\nlistenable,\" as they say. I'd say<br />\nthis is their best yet, but that's<br />\nkind of like saying that the worst<br />\nsex you'll ever have will still be<br />\npretty good.<br />\nConsidering \"Showtime\"<br />\n(Geffen), the third album by<br />\nNitzer Ebb, simple supply and<br />\ndemand tells me that someone<br />\nwants records like this, but who<br />\nare they'?

Roberts is charming,<br />\nand Gere seems to have settled<br />\nnicely into a middle-aged maturity. \"We're similar creatures,\"<br />\nhis character says. \"We both<br />\nscrew people for money.\" The<br />\nfilm tries to be tender, and it<br />\nmostly succeeds. But there is<br />\nsomething somewhat unsettling<br />\n(and almost incestuous) about<br />\nyoung Hollywood trash as older<br />\nman's object, even a pampered<br />\n<br />\none. J. F.

J. Johnson). Reid<br />\nseems remarkably at ease, despite<br />\nthe notorious sky-high hairdo that<br />\ngives him a presence of perpetual<br />\namazement. He's grounded by<br />\nhis grumbling father (the late<br />\nRobin Harris), but is sure that he<br />\ncan't miss the party thrown by<br />\n<br />\nbest friend Play (Christopher<br />\nMartin). Soon the usual John<br />\nHughesian high school minidramas unfold, but it is nice to see<br />\nmiddle-class blacks receive a little cinematic attention for once.<br />\nHudson, who wrote and directed,<br />\nscores some points with his less<br />\nthan subtle caricature of the racist<br />\nliberties taken by white<br />\npolicemen. But he neglects the<br />\nbest aspects of his plot and takes<br />\nthe film in ordinary directions,<br />\nsapping the life out of an otherwise fresh and polished tale.<br />\nThe Hunt for Red October<br />\nTom Clancy's mega-bestselling<br />\n<br />\nnovel is transformed by director<br />\nJohn McTiernan into a bloated<br />\nvessel, an exercize in waterlogged boredom.

The<br />\nUnited States government braces<br />\nfor the Big One, but perky CIA<br />\nanalyst Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin)<br />\nfigures out that Ramius is really<br />\ntrying to defect. Thus, as the ad<br />\nputs it, \"the hunt is on.\" And on,<br />\nand on, and on. Baldwin is incredible as Ryan, the transform-<br />\n<br />\nRichard Gere and Julia Roberts (above left) wander about in a scene,<br />\nfrom \"Pretty Woman.\" Above is Tom Hanks in John Patrick Shanley's;<br />\n\"Joe Versus the Volcano.\"<br />\ned sap, but poor motive development in the script (by Larry<br />\nFerguson and Mark Stewart)<br />\nhangs Connery out to dry.<br />\nRamius is neither glorified nor<br />\npathetic: he just drifts somewhere<br />\nin between. Simply put, all the<br />\nelements that make \"Red October\" such a satisfying read\u2014<br />\ngritty details of docking collars<br />\nand propulsion systems\u2014don't<br />\n<br />\ntranslate.

It is the<br />\nstory of students shipwrecked on<br />\nan empty tropical island, who<br />\n\"do everything that the adults<br />\nwould do\" and end up hunting<br />\nand killing one another in packs.<br />\nHooks has made the students<br />\nAmericans this time around (they<br />\nwere Brits in the first), but his only apparent motive was to slip in<br />\nsly and useless references to<br />\n\"Alf\" and Outward Bound. The<br />\nyoung'actors are competent and<br />\nenergetic, but without Golding's<br />\ndescriptions one has to dig awfully deep to fathom the larger<br />\nthemes that are allegedly etched<br />\non their faces. Once the necessary<br />\nAmericana details begin to fade,<br />\n\"Lord\" weaves an unimpeded,<br />\ndisturbing narrative. But it's difficult to justify all the effort;<br />\nHook's minor fine tuning is<br />\nneither ambitious nor interesting<br />\nenough to warrant much attention. And the film had the worst<br />\nmusical score in recent memory.<br />\nJoe Vs. the Volcano<br />\nTom Hanks and Meg Ryan star<br />\nin John Patrick Shanley's silly<br />\nand witty fairy tale.

The<br />\nfilm is a virtual replica of\"We're<br />\nNo Angels,\" from last<br />\nChristmas: believe it or not,<br />\ncriminal redemption in a religious<br />\ncontext is still unengaging,<br />\npredictable, and unfunny.<br />\nClatrane throws around his<br />\n(substantial) comic weight, but<br />\nIdle has a look that alternates between shock and fatigue. Perhaps<br />\nit's because he's also asked to<br />\nplay a romantic lead, which is<br />\nabout as convincing as Tom<br />\nCruise doing Shakespeare. Or<br />\nbecause he knows that the comic<br />\npremise of the film isn't substantial enough to warrant a ten<br />\nminute Monty Python sketch.<br />\n<br />\nAmerican Panascope, \"home of<br />\nthe rectal probe.\" When he's<br />\ndiagnosed with a terminal brain<br />\nclot and given the chance to jump<br />\ninto a volcano for an eccentric<br />\nbusinessman (the delightful Lloyd<br />\nBridges), Banks sets sail, and<br />\nShanley pulls out the stops. The<br />\nfilm works within familiar<br />\nlocales, but takes the extra tiny<br />\nsteps to remind the audience that<br />\nthis is some sort of alternate reality. Ryan is impressive in three<br />\ndifferent roles, each time selling<br />\nthe fact that she's not the<br />\ncharacter she was before. Hanks<br />\nhas a tendency to whine, but<br />\nShanley keeps him largely under<br />\n<br />\n'Lord of the<br />\nFlies': the worst<br />\nmusical score in<br />\nrecent memory<br />\ncontrol. The narrative in<br />\n\"Volcano\" may not come full<br />\ncircle, but it is refreshing to see<br />\na filmmaker like Shanley, who<br />\ndevotes such passion to his work,<br />\nand to see actors who seem to<br />\nearn their paychecks.<br />\n<br />\nThe Tons in Colle e Rock<br />\n<br />\nNuns on the Run<br />\nCall them creatures of habit:<br />\nBrian Hope (Eric Idle) and<br />\nCharlie McManus (Robbie Col-<br />\n<br />\nMONOLOGUE<br />\n<br />\n'Monster in a Box'<br />\nMONOLOGUE, from 14<br />\ndiscover beauty in Leningrad or<br />\nRhode Island.<br />\nWhat ultimately makes his<br />\nmonologues such an artistic success, however, is a combination.<br />\nof cutting insight and nuanced<br />\ntheatricality.

Dr.<br />\nDavid Olton, a psychology professor here at Hopkins, has been<br />\nswing dancing for years. He and<br />\nTodd Tenenholz, a Hopkins<br />\ngraduate student, organized the<br />\nprogram in which participants<br />\nfirst learned how to dance and<br />\nthen got the chance to show off<br />\ntheir skill at a local swing dance<br />\nclub.<br />\nThe response was overwhelming. Though a 12 person limit<br />\nwas placed on the program, 18<br />\npeople were eventually allowed to<br />\nparticipate. The nine couples first<br />\nlearned the basic steps during the<br />\nfirst two Wednesday nights(even<br />\na Mol Cell exam the following<br />\nThursday did not deter them).<br />\nThey then used those steps the<br />\nfollowing Tuesday, March 6, at<br />\nThe Bop Shop, a Baltimore swing<br />\ndance club. The event culminated<br />\n<br />\nin a trip to the Fells Point Recreation Pier on Saturday, March 10.<br />\nInstructor Todd Tenenholz explained that swing dancing was<br />\nthe type of dancing popular in the<br />\n40s and 50s, a predecessor to the<br />\nhustle and jive. The form he was<br />\nteaching was the six-count jitterbug as opposed to the eight-count<br />\nlindy. Among others, he taught<br />\nsuch moves as the \"side-byside,\" \"double-arm slide,\" and<br />\n\"banana kicks.\"<br />\nSenior Laura Smith, president<br />\nof FSI, worked with Professor<br />\nOlton to organize the program.<br />\nThe object of FSI, says Smith, is<br />\nto \"foster an environment where<br />\nstudents and professors meet<br />\nsocial and become acquainted.\"<br />\nThe FSI, sponsored by the Dean<br />\nof Students, has also organized<br />\nsuch events as nature hikes,<br />\ncharter fishing, white water rafting and a trip to the Dance<br />\nTheatre of Harlem.<br />\nUnfortunately, there are not<br />\nenough spaces to accomodate all<br />\nthose interested in taking part.<br />\nLast semester, 300 students applied for 100 spots.

The CCP has<br />\ncompiled information books on<br />\nmany companies, and they<br />\nreceive several different career<br />\nplacement brochures in which<br />\ncompanies advertise themselves.<br />\nIf you exhaust those sources,<br />\nyou could try networking. Ask<br />\nyou parents and other relatives to<br />\nlook into job opportunities<br />\nthrough the business contacts they<br />\nknow. Send them copies of your<br />\nresume so they can help spread<br />\nthe word about your abilities. Just<br />\nkeep in mind that your parents<br />\ncan only introduce you to prospective employers.<br />\nAfter you contact a few<br />\nbusinesses, you should be<br />\nprepared to follow up your initial<br />\nefforts. Contact CCP for more<br />\ntips, and in the fall semester look<br />\nfor notices for the job applicatoin<br />\nworkshops that CCP holds.<br />\nFor returning undergraduates,<br />\nan alternative to a paid summer<br />\njob is an internship. According to<br />\nDr. J.D. Goodyear, the academic<br />\nadvisor who coordinates internships, the application process and<br />\n<br />\nresponsibilities of an internship<br />\nare similar to a summer job. An<br />\ninternship is generally unpaid,<br />\nthough a faculty-sponsored internship done in Baltimore and<br />\nWashington, D.C. areas may be<br />\ncredited for a maximum of three<br />\ncredits.<br />\nDr. Goodyear cautions,<br />\nthough, that \"basically, you don't<br />\ndo an internship for credit, you<br />\ndo it for the line on the resume.\"<br />\nChoosing an internship requires<br />\nmore planning than deciding<br />\nwhich summer job to take. If you<br />\nalready have have an idea of your<br />\npost-graduate plans, you can<br />\nthink of an internship as a way to<br />\nget first hand experience in a<br />\nfuture job. Contact Dr. Goodyear<br />\nat the Office of Academic Advising for more information.<br />\nIf you decide to hunt for a job<br />\nat somewhere other than the<br />\nburger joint down the street, keep<br />\na few pointers in mind. You<br />\nshould start the application process early, and you should be<br />\nprepared to dedicate time to<br />\nwriting a resume, contacting<br />\npotential employers, and following up. Most important, keep in<br />\nmind that throughout the application process, your are selling your<br />\nabilities.

The Blue Jays surprised everyone by beating<br />\nFranklin & Marshall on the road<br />\nto advance to the third round of<br />\nthe tournament before losing<br />\n79-69 to fifth ranked Western<br />\nConnecticut. Hopkins won the<br />\nconsolation game against<br />\nStockton State the following day<br />\nto finish the year at 20-8.<br />\n<br />\nWestern Connecticut's physical<br />\nstyle of play, tight man-to-man<br />\ndefense, overall size and<br />\nathleticism, and experience proved too much for the Blue Jays,<br />\nwho battled from behind for the<br />\nentire second half but could never<br />\ncatch the Colonials. Hopkins<br />\ntrailed by three at the half, 36-33,<br />\nthe same halftime deficit they faced in the Franklin & Marshall<br />\ngame. This time, however,<br />\nWestern Connecticut's insideoutside tandem, William Shepard<br />\nand Gerry Corrigan, took control<br />\nof the game, scoring 9 and 10<br />\npoints, respectively, in the first<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\nDave Eikenberg (on ground) helped guide the Jays to the Sweet Sixteen.<br />\n<br />\n12 minutes of the second half to<br />\nhelp the Colonials to a 61-51<br />\nlead. Hopkins staged a 9-0 run,<br />\nhighlighted by two field goals by<br />\nsophomore Evan Jones and a<br />\nthree-point play by Jay Gangemi<br />\nto cut the lead to 61-60 with five<br />\nminutes to play. But the Jays<br />\ncould not take the lead, as two<br />\nbuckets by Corrigan and a fastbreak layup gave Western Connecticut a comfortable seven<br />\npoint lead with 3:45 left. Hopkins<br />\ngot no closer than five the rest of<br />\nthe way.<br />\n\"At that point [61-60], we<br />\ndidn't have much left,\" said head<br />\ncoach Bob Nelson. \"We battled<br />\nback from twelve down [52-40],<br />\nand I think making up that deficit<br />\ntook its toll. They are bigger and<br />\nstronger than we are and they<br />\nplayed like seniors.\" Western<br />\nfeatures four starting seniors,<br />\nwhile Hopkins has no seniors<br />\namong its top six players.<br />\nThe referees, who were<br />\ncriticized by many of the Hopkins<br />\nfaithful, called a \"let-them-play\"<br />\ntype of game that greatly favored<br />\nWestern Connecticut, whose<br />\nplayers vigorously challenge the<br />\ndribble and constantly reach in<br />\nand try to strip the ball loose.<br />\nHopkins employs less of a gambling, physical style of defense and<br />\nwere unable to take advantage of<br />\nthe referee's reluctant whistles.<br />\n\"A physical game definitely goes<br />\nto our opponent's advantage<br />\nbecause we aren't a physical<br />\nteam,\" said Nelson. \"We go a<br />\nlong way with our starters and try<br />\nnot to get into foul trouble.\"<br />\nNelson, however, refused to<br />\npin any blame on the refs, even<br />\nthough junior Andy Enfield was<br />\nknocked to the floor on at least<br />\nthree occasions without a foul being called. \"In the first half, we<br />\nhad trouble stopping them inside,<br />\nespecially [center Gary] Bestman<br />\nand Shepard,\" said Nelson. Each<br />\nhad ten points at the intermission.<br />\n\"Then Corrigan got hot in the second half.\" That he did, and he<br />\nhad little trouble getting off<br />\n<br />\nunobstructed shots. Corrigan used his quickness and took advantage of many screens from his<br />\nteammates when he was guarded<br />\nby Enfield, and simply shot over<br />\nthe smaller David Eikenberg.<br />\nCorrigan finished with 21 points<br />\non 10-of-14 shooting. \"We [the<br />\ncoaching staff] should have done<br />\na better job of instructing the<br />\nplayers on how to guard him,\"<br />\nNelson said later. \"If I had to do<br />\nanything different, I'd have given<br />\nEnfield more help on defense.\"<br />\nEnfield kept Hopkins in the<br />\ngame by pouring in 27 points, including 12-of-12 from the line.<br />\nJones and junior Bill Zahn were<br />\nable to keep the Colonials off<br />\nHopkins' defensive boards, notching 16 rebounds between them.<br />\nThe Jays were also able to stay<br />\nclose by preventing Western from<br />\nturning the game into a run-andgun, high turnover affair. \"They<br />\nexecute their offense as well as<br />\nany team we've played,\" commented Western head coach Bob<br />\nCampbell. Enfield was unable to<br />\nget open by running around<br />\nscreens, as the Western guards<br />\noverplayed him at all times. Enfield countered with preplanned back door cuts, or the<br />\n\"cross\" play. Sometimes, Enfield would even signal the play<br />\nto Eikenberg (by crossing his<br />\narms) right in front of the<br />\nWestern defender, then immediately slip back-door where<br />\nEikenberg would hit him with a<br />\nquick pass.<br />\nHopkins rebounded to win the<br />\nconsolation game the following<br />\nnight against Stockton State,<br />\nwhich had been edged by<br />\nWashington College. Hopkins<br />\nfell behind 28-13 ten minutes into the game. \"I was thinking,<br />\n'this could be a real blowout' at<br />\nthe time,\" said Nelson. Indeed,<br />\nthe Jays could have easily rolled<br />\nover and just played out the<br />\nseason. But they didn't. \"These<br />\nkids have a lot of pride,\" said<br />\nNelson. \"Our bench came in and<br />\ndid a good job, especially [senior]<br />\n<br />\nKevin Roller. [Freshman] Danny Knee and [senior Joel] Siepierski played well too. When the<br />\nstarters went back in they had a<br />\nnew lease on life. And then<br />\n[sophomore Jay] Gangemi got<br />\nhot.\" Gangemi scored nine points<br />\nin the last six minutes of the first<br />\nhalf to help cut the margin to<br />\neight, 44-36, by halftime.<br />\nThe Jays simply dominated the<br />\nsecond half, outscoring Stockton<br />\nSt. 44-30 to win 80-74. Gangemi<br />\nled the way with 34 points, including 4-of-7 three pointers, and<br />\nsix rebounds. Enfield chipped in<br />\n23, and Zahn and Jones again rebounded well, pulling down a<br />\ntotal of 17. The come back gave<br />\nthe Jays win number 20, the<br />\nhighest total in Hopkins history.<br />\nThe Jays also set the record for<br />\nthe most consecutive successful<br />\nfree throws in the tournament by<br />\nhitting 37 straight in the two<br />\ngames. Enfield alone was<br />\n18-of-18.<br />\n\"It was a successful season,\"<br />\nsaid Enfield. \"I think we went a<br />\nlot farther than other people expected us to. But I thought we had<br />\nthe talent all along.\" Part of that<br />\nuntapped talent in the form of<br />\nJones, who suddenly came alive<br />\nhalfway through the season.<br />\nJones began playing a great<br />\noverall game: posting up, scoring inside, passing, rebounding,<br />\nand even outside shooting. \"He<br />\njust played great,\" said Enfield.<br />\n\"That was one of the reasons I<br />\nthought we had the talent at the<br />\nbeginning of the year.\"<br />\nEnfield had an outstanding year<br />\nhimself, finishing with a team<br />\nleading 21.6 scoring average. He<br />\nalso finished the year with a 92.6<br />\nfree throw percentage. On the<br />\nseason he hit 137 and missed 11.<br />\nHe ended on a 34-of-35 streak.<br />\nEnfield made GTE second-team<br />\ncollege division Academic AllAmerica, which includes all Division II and Division III players.<br />\nThe award honors those athletes<br />\nwho have excelled on the court<br />\nand in the classroom.<br />\n<br />\nJay Gangemi emerged to<br />\nbecome the number two scorer in<br />\naveraging 16.4 ppg and Shooting<br />\n48 percent. He is also Hopkins'<br />\nbest defensive player, and if his<br />\noften-injured ankles hold up, he<br />\nshould be even more of a force<br />\nnext year.<br />\nOne pleasant surprise was the<br />\nemergence of Eikenberg as the<br />\nman who runs the show on the<br />\ncourt for Hopkins, both at the offensive and defensive end.<br />\nEikenberg was thrust into full<br />\ntime point guard duties when<br />\nDavid Strong went down with a<br />\nback injury. Strong, who has<br />\nbeen called \"Eikenberg with a<br />\njump shot,\" is expected back next<br />\nseason, which will give the Jays<br />\nmore depth at that position.<br />\n\"Eikenberg is the guy on the<br />\nteam that we could least afford to<br />\nlose,\" said Nelson, a strong statement considering Enfield and<br />\nGangemi score half of Hopkins'<br />\npoints. Like Jones, Eikenberg<br />\nsuddenly became more of an offensive force about halfway<br />\nthrough the season. He started<br />\nlooking to shoot off his drives to<br />\nthe basket rather than always<br />\npassing, presenting a greater<br />\nthreat to the defense.<br />\nNelson is also hoping for some<br />\ntop recruits to choose Hopkins.<br />\nOne of his targets is a 6'6\"<br />\nplayer, who would give the Jays<br />\nsome needed size inside. Next<br />\nyear's team will definitely have<br />\none advantage over this year's<br />\nsquad, more experience. Enfield,<br />\nEikenberg, and Zahn will be<br />\nseniors and Gangemi and Jones<br />\nwill be juniors, and the team has<br />\ngotten a good taste of tournament<br />\npressure. When asked if he<br />\nthought the Jays could advance<br />\nfarther in the tournament next<br />\nyear, Enfield responded,<br />\n\"definitely. We have to handle<br />\npressure situations bettec, and be<br />\nable to adjust to different teams<br />\nwith different styles of play. I<br />\nthink we'll have the experience to<br />\ndo that.\"<br />\n<br />\nMen's lacrosse suffers early setbacks<br />\nby Josh Orenstein<br />\nBefore the season began, coach<br />\nDon Zimmerman said that he<br />\nbelieved the Blue Jays needed to<br />\nstruggle in order to succeed this<br />\nyear.

The<br />\nteam finished at 13-7-1 overall<br />\nand 8-5-1 in the Mason-Dixon<br />\nLeague.<br />\nIn their first game against Gettysburg, the Blue Jays got<br />\noutstanding goaltending from<br />\nDavid Bowyer, which kept them<br />\nin the game long enough to allow<br />\nthe offense of Hopkins to finally<br />\nbreak through.<br />\nIn the opening two periods, the<br />\nBullets dominated the action as<br />\nthey outshot Hopkins 30-10. Only<br />\none of their shots was able to beat<br />\nBowyer, however, as many of his<br />\n29 saves were spectacular.<br />\n\"Dave's the toughest goalie in<br />\nthe league, and when he's hot<br />\nyou're just not going to get it by<br />\nhim unless you make a really<br />\nspecial effort,\" commented Captain Mike Holmes. The Bullets<br />\nwould agree.<br />\nTrailing 1-0 to open the third<br />\nperiod, the Jays looked to get the<br />\noffense moving.

Bowyer and Co.<br />\nwere up to the task, however, as<br />\nthey continuously thwarted good<br />\nopportunities for the Bullets.<br />\nWith only a minute to play, the<br />\nJays caught a break. While attempting to clear the puck from<br />\nbehind his net, the Gettysburg<br />\n<br />\ngoaltender threw the puck right<br />\nto Hopkins defenseman Craig<br />\nHampton.

In the first period<br />\nthe Midshipmen were all over the<br />\nJays as they opened up a 3-0 advantage. That was the end of<br />\nNavy scoring, however, as the<br />\nJays unleashed a ferocious offensive onslaught which tallied 10<br />\ngoals over the final two periods<br />\nto give the Jays a satisfying 10-3<br />\nvictory.

Hopkins was missing<br />\ntwo of its top five players, Lorin<br />\nEngquist and Ted Roth, because<br />\nof class conflicts, forcing<br />\neveryone else to move up two<br />\nslots and two reserve players step<br />\nup to play #5 and #6 singles.<br />\nFortunately for Hopkins, one<br />\nof those reserves was junior Jon<br />\nMissner, who started all of last<br />\nseason and currently starts at second doubles, and has a lot of<br />\nmatch expereince. Missner notched a straight set victory. Unfortunately for Hopkins, he was<br />\nthe only Blue Jay player to win<br />\nhis singles match, which meant<br />\nthat Hopkins was eliminated<br />\nbefore any of the three doubles<br />\nmatches were completed. Ryu<br />\nIwai, the only senior on the team,<br />\nlost at #1 singles; freshman Bill<br />\nBraude lost at #2; junior Sam<br />\nKim lost at #3; freshman Mike<br />\nKim (no relation to Sam) lost at<br />\n#6.<br />\nAlthough tennis is considered<br />\na gentlemanly sport, by the end<br />\nof the match there was definitely<br />\nno love lost between Catholic and<br />\nHopkins. Catholic's #1 player,<br />\nGeorge Santana, angered some<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins team,<br />\nespecially assistant coach Tom<br />\nMcCarthy, when he openly and<br />\nverbally celebrated a double fault<br />\nby Iwai.<br />\nLater on, Iwai and Santana faced each other again in a doubles<br />\nmatch. Iwai and Braude were up<br />\n6-1, 5-2 when more trouble<br />\nstarted. With Iwai at the net,<br />\nBraude set to receive serve, the<br />\nCatholic player served the ball as<br />\nhard as he could directly at Iwai.<br />\nConsidering that he had fairly<br />\ngood control over his serve the<br />\nwhole day, it was obvious to most<br />\nwhat the intentions behind the<br />\n\"errant\" serve were.<br />\nMcCarthy was noticeably<br />\nangered at the action, and addressed it to Catholic's coach,<br />\n<br />\nwho did nothing. In fact, he appeared to make a direct threat or<br />\nchallenge to the Catholic player.<br />\n\"When he serves the ball 130<br />\nmiles per hour at my number one<br />\nplayer, of course I'm going to be<br />\nupset,\" McCarthy commented.<br />\nCooler heads prevailed, however,<br />\nand the Catholic team was able to<br />\nleave campus unscathed.<br />\nThe following day Hopkins<br />\ntook on Division I neighbor<br />\nLoyola, seeking to rebound from<br />\nthe 7-2 defeat. This time all of<br />\nHopkins' made the match. Engquist got pounded at #2 singles,<br />\n6-3, 6-0, although he had beaten<br />\nhis opponent last year 6-3, 6-4.<br />\nBraude suffered a similar fate at<br />\n#3, 6-0, 6-4, even though he had<br />\nalso beaten Loyola's #2 player<br />\nlast fall. However, Sam Kim<br />\ncame through with a long threeset win in the #4 slot, and Ted<br />\nRoth thoroughly dismantled his<br />\nopponent, 6-1, 6-3, in about ten<br />\nminutes at #5. Mike Kim fought<br />\nhis way to a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 win in<br />\na<br />\ntwo-and-one-half-hour<br />\nmarathon, giving Hopkins a slim<br />\n3-2 lead going into the doubles.<br />\nYou may be wondering what<br />\nhappened in the first singles<br />\nmatch.

The CUS's<br />\nvoting members comprise four<br />\nstudents and six faculty members,<br />\nincluding Dean of Academic Advising Martha Roseman, who<br />\nchairs the CUS. The deans of<br />\nArts and Sciences and Engineering attend the CUS meetings, but<br />\nhave no vote.<br />\nThe Academic Council is composed of faculty and administrators, including University<br />\npresident Steven Muller. It<br />\nultimately set University policy<br />\non all academic matters.<br />\nThe CUS itself has no power<br />\nto enact academic rule changes.<br />\nAccording to the committee's<br />\ncharge, the CUS may submit proposals regarding undergraduate<br />\nacademic programs and degree<br />\nrequirements to the Academic<br />\nCouncil for approval. In the past<br />\nthese proposals have ranged from<br />\nchanging the add/drop policy to<br />\nthe creation of new majors and<br />\nminors. Either students or faculty members of the CUS may submit proposals.<br />\nWhile the CUS has been effective in formulating new policies,<br />\nDe Cagna decried the lack of formal by-laws defining the role of<br />\nthe CUS. In his view, the<br />\nAcademic Council should not impinge on the rights of the CUS<br />\nand the Student Council in determining the CUS's student<br />\nmembership.<br /><br />\nDe Cagna called the rule<br />\nchange requiring an engineering<br />\nstudent on the CUS an infringement upon the Student Council<br />\nright to choose the CUS<br />\nmembers.<br />\nTraditionally, the four student<br />\nmembers of the CUS are: the Student Council president, the<br />\nEducation Committee chair of the<br />\nStudent Council, and two additional students selected by the<br />\nCommittee on Committees<br />\n(COC). In the past, engineering<br />\nstudents have generally not been<br />\nmembers of the CUS.<br />\nQuestioned about the lack of<br />\nengineering students on the CUS,<br />\nDe Cagna wondered \"where they<br />\nwere at application time?\" He felt<br />\nthat if the G.W.C. Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering is concerned about the lack of engineering<br />\nstudent representation, the deans<br />\nand faculty members of that<br />\nschool should encourage their<br />\nstudents to apply for the CUS, not<br />\nmandate a position.<br />\n\"It -should never be the policy<br />\nof any organization to choose its<br />\nmembers based on the number of<br />\napplications it receives from any<br />\nspecific group,\" countered<br />\nHoward Ying of Tau Beta Pi, the<br />\nnational engineering honor society. \"The G.W.C.

Along with becoming<br />\nan expert at how Hopkins actually<br />\n.operates, he will have to name a<br />\npermanent provost, and a new<br />\ndean for the School of Health and<br />\nPublic Hygiene. President<br />\nRichardson will also have to<br />\ndetermine the long-range relationship between Hopkins and the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory.<br />\nBut he also noted, \"If he<br />\n[Richardson] is as good as everbody says he is, we should be in<br />\ngood shape.\"<br />\nWolman finally noted that he is<br />\nthe chairman for the provost<br />\nsearch committee. He cited four<br />\nmain issues the new provost will<br />\nhave to work on with President<br />\nRichardson.<br />\nFirst, he will have to continue<br />\nfocusing on the ongoing financial<br />\ncondition of the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences.<br />\nHe must determine what the<br />\nrole of undergraduates and the<br />\nArts and Sciences in the greater<br />\nHopkins framework should be.<br />\nHe will also have to help determine the permanent role of the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory,and he<br />\nwill have to work to promote interdivisional cooperation among<br />\nthe different schools at Hopkins.<br />\nWolman said that there was no<br />\nstudent input in selecting the last<br />\nprovost and was unsure whether<br />\nthere would be any student input<br />\nthis time.<br /><br />\nTitit-<br /><br />\ni2spri To DETAIL<br />\nOF<br />\nP<br />\nLACE<br />\nITEIll<br />\n300417 TO /veld<br />\n93Pfl TO LOS Yopic<br /><br />\n)0Ati TO NE41 ANGELES<br />\n6P11 TO NEld YORK<br />\nN<br />\nYORK<br />\n6All TO<br />\nN<br />\n7PM TO SAN<br />\nCLEVELAND<br />\nPP; TO NE*41 \"AN<br />\nOH'<br />\nCA<br />\nYORK<br />\nPrI ro DALLAS<br />\nNY ii<br />\n)fl<br />\nTO<br />\nTx<br />\ntl TO<br />\nPALtiseAcH<br />\nFL<br />\nll<br /><br />\nArlouNT<br />\nS.30<br />\nitt \u2022 50<br /><br />\n6'RIGANTINE NJ<br />\nCHICAGO<br />\n'I TO Nt41<br />\nTO<br />\nIL<br />\ni To<br />\nNtlil YORK<br />\nNY<br />\nYORK<br />\n' To ti/NN<br />\na<br />\nNY<br />\nNEIII<br />\nTO<br />\n2<br />\nInv<br />\nYORK<br />\n447<br />\npHTLA<br />\nro P<br />\nNY 2<br />\nTO A HILA<br />\nPA 2 e<br />\nTO P LBANY<br />\nPA 2<br />\nro NEHILA<br />\nAlY<br />\ns<br />\n-141<br />\nPA<br />\nYORK<br />\n21<br /><br />\n41:23<br />\n2.45<br />\nCONTINur,<br /><br />\nJournalism<br />\ncrucified<br />\nAPPLE, from 2<br />\ncarn---Paigns.

McColl<br /><br />\nUndermined CUS needs raison d'etre<br />\nThere's a lot in this week's News-Letter about the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, and many of you may<br />\nbe wondering what the big deal is. The big deal is this:<br />\nThe CUS is potentially the most powerful student influence<br />\non Homewood's academic policies, and several recent<br />\nevents have undermined its authority.<br />\nThe CUS exists primarily as a vehicle for students, faculty and administrators to air grievances about academic<br />\npolicy and to propose possible solutions. Proposals accepted by the CUS are then presented to the Academic<br />\nCouncil for final consideration. Particularly for students,<br />\nthe CUS represents the main means to forming the policies<br />\nwhich directly affect them.<br />\nThe CUS, which is composed of both students and faculty, has impressively served the student body's needs and<br />\ndesires. The Pass/Fail option has been kept alive by the<br />\nCUS, as was the current Add/Drop deadline and policies.<br />\nLast year, however, the Deans of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering ignored the rebuff the CUS delivered to their<br />\nproposal for a B.A. degree in Engineering, and took it to<br />\nthe Academic Council despite the CUS's ruling.(Note that<br />\nstudents must go through the CUS to initiate debate,<br />\nwhereas deans and faculty may directly approach the<br />\nAcademic Council, even about matters concerning the<br />\nundergraduate population.)<br />\nAny previous authority the CUS had earned was<br />\nobliterated by the Deans' gesture and the Academic Council's acceptance of it. As Jeff De Cagna points out, a precedent has now been set for the administration to simply ignore the students' only voice in the academic decision making process.<br />\nOn top of this insult, the Academic Council, of which<br />\nthe CUS is a subcommittee, has dictated that at least one<br />\nof the four students on the CUS must be from the School<br />\nof Engineering, and one must be from Arts and Sciences.<br />\nObviously, in an ideal world all groups\u2014engineering,<br />\nnatural sciences, humanities, poly sci, et al.\u2014should be<br />\nrepresented in the CUS. But it's also important that the<br />\nfour representatives be highly committed people who are<br />\naware of current policies as well as the desires of the community. To find a student from Engineering or Arts and<br />\nSciences to simply fulfill the Academic Council's mandate is unacceptable: the CUS should remain a meritocracy<br />\nof sorts. Deans and faculty from each school should, instead, encourage students to become involved in forming<br />\ntheir own destinies. The CUS has the potential to become<br />\na visible and vocal part of the University.<br /><br />\nthrobbing head pain, and bloody<br />\nnoses also happen to be symptoms of such ailments as brain lesions and cerebral hemorrhages.<br />\nIn a recent government study, in<br />\nfact, the bulk of money donated<br />\nto televangelists was found to<br />\nhave come from sinus victims,<br />\nwho were told that sometimes<br />\nquote \"God seeth His Divine way<br />\nclear to squeezeth the heads of his<br />\nbeloved into marmalade\"<br />\n'unquote.<br />\nThe fact of the matter is that<br />\nsinusitis isn't all that painful or<br />\nunpleasant, it's just annoying. A<br />\ncouple of aspirin will take care of<br />\nthe headache, and you get used<br />\nto the sound checks after a while.<br />\nThe awful thing about sinus trouble is going to the doctor because<br />\nall doctors fall into the category<br />\nof people who look you up and<br />\ndown and say \"Yeah, so?\" Also,<br />\nalthough doctors would never admit it, studies of sinusitis have<br />\ncaused no improvements since<br />\naround the Battle of Hastings,<br />\nwhen soldiers with sinus infections were treated by having<br />\nleeches placed over their nostrils<br />\nto suck out the phlegm. This<br />\nhelped in only precious few<br />\ncases, however, and many patients came out of treatment looking very silly.<br />\nAs a result, nowadays, the<br />\nprescribed treatment is for doctors to press on that section of the<br />\nface just below the eyes until the<br />\npatient's eyeball pops out into the<br />\ndoctor's hand. At this point the<br />\ndoctor should ask, \"Does it hurt<br />\nwhen I do that?\" The patient will<br />\nof course be unable to answer<br />\nbecause he will have just died of<br />\na cerebral hemorrhage, thus<br />\nenabling the doctor to perform a<br />\ntechnique delicately labeled<br />\n\"sinus scraping,\" used before the<br />\nleech advancements of 1066(having never made it up to the<br />\neyeball popping part, I have no<br />\nidea what occurs here, although<br />\nI have a pretty clear picture in my<br />\nmind involving dentist's implements), and put them on<br /><br />\nI'm sick as a dog. As two dogs.<br />\nSicker than two dogs. I'm probably sicker than a litterful of<br />\nDobermans with kennel cough.<br />\nI've got a sinus infection. A<br />\nsinus infection is one of those<br />\nthings where if you tell someone<br />\nabout it and they've had one, they<br />\nimmediately send large black<br />\nfloral arrangements to your folks,<br />\nwhile if you tell someone and<br />\nthey've never had one, they just<br />\nlook you up and down and say,<br />\n\"Yeah, so?\"<br />\nThe sinusitis sufferer appears<br />\nnormal to all observers, except<br />\nfor a nauseous smile that crosses<br />\nhis or her face while speaking.<br />\nThis is because what the observer<br />\nhears as the victim's everyday<br />\nspeaking voice sounds to the<br />\nsinusitis victim like a microphone<br />\ncheck into the mouth of a subterranean cavern.<br />\nThe sinuses are apparently a<br />\nnetwork of tiny tubes that run<br />\nthrough the nose, around the<br />\neyes, into the ears and back<br />\nthrough the head, ending<br />\nsomewhere in Dubuque. They<br />\nserve no purpose that I can<br />\ndiscern, although in periods of intense weather flux, they do<br />\nbecome a sort of \"Natural<br />\nBarometer,\" barometric pressure<br />\nbeing determined by the level of<br />\nphlegm accumulating within<br />\nthem. This accumulation is then<br />\nturned to liquid cement by the<br />\nbody's defenses, and any subsequent phlegm trying to work its<br />\nway into the same sinuses will<br />\nsimply surround the blockage and<br />\nbegin throbbing the drum beat to<br />\nBarry Manilow's \"Copacabana\"<br />\non the inside of the victim's head.<br />\nSinusitis victims often have the<br />\nsensation of being \"stuffed up,\"<br />\nlike when you have a cold. But,<br />\nthere is nothing in your nose, only your sinuses, so blowing<br />\ndoesn't help. Although, if you<br />\nblow hard enough, you can give<br />\nyourself a bloody nose. It is for<br />\nthis precise reason that sinusitis<br />\nis a bad thing for hypochondriacs<br />\nto develop, as hearing trouble, See PUNCH, 9<br /><br />\nLet's have a re-election<br />\nThe controversy surrounding the Student Council presidential elections this past week has been a combination of both<br />\nencouraging and discouraging portents.<br />\nCouncil's overwhelming support for another run-off, in<br />\nlight of serious allegations of electoral impropriety, was<br />\na positive step. We are encouraged that the Council takes<br />\nitself seriously enough to stand on principle and call for<br />\nsuch a move, despite the inconvenience that another election will entail. Better yet, the Council managed to retain<br />\nits composure at this Wednesday's meeting, when its<br />\nrenegade Board of Elections chose to ignore Council's<br />\nstrong recommendation for a new vote. The Director of<br />\nStudent Activities, Bill Smedick, will decide this morning whether to override the Board's ruling on behalf of<br />\nCouncil. We hope Smedick will do so.<br />\nThe Board of Election's posturing this week is perplexing. There is little question that there were numerous opportunities for ballot-stuffing, and that the electoral process was seriously mismanaged. One would expect that<br />\nthe Board, whose very purpose is to avoid such behavior,<br />\nwould embrace the opportunity to hold another election<br />\nand to redeem itself. For whatever reason, this has regrettably not been the case. Questions about electoral validity<br />\ncan only hurt the candidates and the Student Council.<br />\nThroughout the year, the Student Council has conducted<br />\nitself with admirable dignity and self-respect. The importance of such a demeanor cannot be underestimated during a time in which the University is in considerable flux.<br />\nA decision to hold another run-off election could only increase the undergraduates' credibility. Those who have<br />\nsuggested that the need to hold another election would<br />\nundermine Council's prestige are completely wrong. On<br />\nthe contrary: holding another election would be a powerful gesture in favor of competence and integrity.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nMind/Brain<br /><br />\nThe punchline is this: sinus says<br /><br />\nAs one of the few committees composed of both faculty<br />\nand students, the CUS could also become an effective watchdog over academic policies concerning undergraduates,<br />\nand the University as a whole. The action taken by the<br />\nDeans to usurp the CUS's authority undermines the committee's legitimacy. The CUS has proven itself a necessary<br />\nand effective body, but it needs and deserves a defined<br />\npurpose to develop to its fullest potential.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nTwo weeks ago, the<br />\nMind/Brain Institute and Johns<br />\nHopkins University made known<br />\ntheir intention of moving the Institute into Rowland Hall. This is<br />\ndefinitely an improvement over<br />\nthe cramped quarters currently<br />\noccupied by the Mind/Brain Institute in Jenkins Hall. The completion of the new Physics<br />\nbuilding will allow the Physics<br />\ndepartment to vacate Rowland<br />\nHall, allowing for the Mind/Brain<br />\nInstitute to move in and share the<br />\npremises with the Mathematics<br />\nDepartment. I am certain that<br />\nmany advances will now be possible in the field of Brain Science,<br />\nespecially due to the generous gift<br />\nof $7.5 million by Mr. Zanvyl<br />\nKrieger (Class of '28).<br />\nThese changes are not only<br />\nnecessary, but also beneficial to<br />\nall parties involved. However,<br />\nthere is one consequence that I<br />\nhave failed to mention so far.<br />\nBy virtue of the contribution<br />\nMr. Krieger has made to the<br />\nUniversity, it has been decided<br />\nthat Rowland Hall should be<br />\nrenamed Krieger Hall. This is utterly unsatisfactory.<br />\nHenry Augustus Rowland was<br />\na member of the first faculty of<br />\nthis University. His contribution<br />\nto Physics at Hopkins are of the<br />\nsame magnitude as those of Ira<br />\nRemsen to Hopkins Chemistry.<br />\nHow can the name of Rowland be<br />\nremoved from the names that<br />\ngrace the Upper Quad'? Gilman,<br />\nAmes, Mergenthaler, Remsen,<br />\nEisenhower, and . . . Krieger?<br />\nOf course, the contribution of<br />\nMr. Krieger should not be<br />\noverlooked. Why not name the<br />\nMind/Brain Institute for its<br />\nbenefactor? In fact, the \"Krieger<br />\nMind/Brain Institute\" in<br />\nRowland Hall sounds much more<br />\nsatisfying, and it is ultimately<br />\nmore appropriate also. For it was<br />\nthe Institute that was enlivened by<br />\nMr. Krieger, not the building in<br />\nwhich it will be housed.<br />\nI appeal to the University to<br />\nreconsider the injustice it is about<br /><br />\nto inflict on the namesake of<br />\nRowland Hall, since he does<br />\nbelong on one of the main quads<br />\nalong with the other pioneers of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nChetan U. Kharod<br /><br />\nParsley, Part II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFour weeks ago I wrote a letter concerning President Bush's<br />\nvisit to Hopkins. In the following<br />\nissue, four letters were published in response. If the News-Letter<br />\nwill allow, I would like to comment on some of the accusations<br />\nthat were made.<br />\nAccusation #1: Elliot Yasnovsky claims that I \"felt that the<br />\ndemonstration<br />\n...<br />\nwas<br />\npointless.\" This is not true. I only<br />\nstated that the protest would have<br />\nbeen more effective if it had been<br />\nfocused against the people who<br />\nchose Bush as an honorary degree<br />\nrecipient.<br />\nAccusation #2: Mr. Yasnovsky<br />\nclaims that I have been \"misled<br />\nby misconceptions\" about Bush.<br />\nIt is stupid of him to make this<br />\nclaim when our letters agree that<br />\nBush is not doing enough to improve health care.<br /><br />\nAccusation #3: Mr. Yasnovsky<br />\nclaims that I neglect my political<br />\nrights and \"want others to neglect<br />\ntheirs as well.\" Did my letter say<br />\nanything that any intelligent person would interpret this way? No.<br />\nIs this accusation stupid'? Yes.<br />\nAccusation #4: Don Kuchy<br />\nclaims that I \"call protest an act<br />\nof stupidity.\" He also claims that<br />\nby holding this opinion I want to<br />\ndeny others their constitutional<br />\nrights of protest and participation<br />\nin political issues. Again, I only<br />\nstated that the protest should have<br />\nbeen focused in a different direction. Mr. Kuchy has the right to<br />\nwrite zealous attacks against me<br />\nif he wishes, but I wish he<br />\nweren't so stupid about it. I also<br />\nwish he wouldn't make stuff up.<br />\nAccusation #5: Mr. Kuchy<br />\nclaims that it is irrelevant that<br />\nover 90 percent of the Panamanian people supported the<br />\ninvasion of their country. He<br />\nstates, \"The number of Panamanian lives lost reaffirms the fact<br />\nthat Bush is a butcher.\" Does this<br />\nmean that Roosevelt is a butcher<br />\nfor the D-Day invasion'? You are<br />\nwrong Mr. Kuchy, and over 90<br />\npercent of Panama agrees with<br />\nme.<br />\nAccusation #6: Two letters<br />\nclaimed that Bush is indeed a thief<br />\n(I claimed that he wasn't in my<br /><br />\nHarassment<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWith all the recent debate concerning discrimination and intolerance on campus, I am compelled to relate an experience I<br />\nSee LETTERS, 8<br /><br />\n\"ryk.<br />\ntie PfrkrAL.<br /><br />\nYEARi,<br />\n(Of/NS<br /><br />\nAndrew Parsley<br /><br />\n(AST'RuCT,olv 00<br /><br />\n10 1194-R oF IS<br />\n74<br /><br />\nletter), and examples of how his<br />\npolicies\u2014or lack thereof\u2014<br />\nconstituted thievery. I agree with<br />\nthe substance of many of these<br />\ncriticisms, but I hardly think that<br />\ndisagreements over policy justify<br />\nthe term \"thief.\" Also, both letters blame Bush for problems<br />\nwhich began long before he<br />\nbecame president. If we were to<br />\nblame Bush for everything that<br />\nhas gone wrong in the past year,<br />\ndo we also give him credit for<br />\neverything that has gone right?<br />\nDo we give him credit for the end<br />\nof the Cold War'?<br />\nAccusation #7: Kay Carter<br />\nclaims that I was wrong when I<br />\ncriticized the Students for Environmental Action for participating in the protest (I claimed that they were alienating<br />\nRepublicans). After reading her<br />\nletter, I must say that she is correct.

The CUS<br />\nis, arguably, the most important<br />\nstudent-populated university<br />\ncommittee. Student members<br />\nhave the ability to influence<br />\nacademic policy directly by<br />\nrepresenting student body concerns at a level where they can<br />\nhave an impact. Additionally,<br />\nstudents may initiate changes in<br />\nacademic policy by submitting<br />\noriginal proposals for committee<br />\nconsideration. Finally, the student<br />\nmembers of the CUS have the<br />\npower to vote on all proposed<br />\ncommittee actions. In short, this<br />\nframework provides students with<br />\na significant opportunity to influence the system. (It is important to add at this juncture that all<br />\nactions of the CUS must be approved by the Academic Council,<br />\nof which the former is a standing<br />\ncommittee.)<br />\nAs a member of this committee, I utilized my resources to<br />\ntheir fullest extent. I submitted<br />\nproposals designed to offer<br />\nstudents more academic choices.<br />\nI vigorously defended the student<br />\npoint of view on controversial<br />\nissues like the Add/Drop and the<br />\nelimination of the Pass/Fail option. And I utilized my membership on the CUS to help set in<br />\nmotion the progress of helping<br />\nforeign teaching assistants with<br />\ntheir English language proficiency. My purpose in detailing my<br />\npersonal CUS accomplishments<br />\nis to illustrate that I took my participation on this committee very<br />\nseriously. At every CUS meeting,<br />\nI believed (and still do believe)<br />\nthat I was representing the student<br />\nbody, working for the good of all<br />\nstudents, regardless of the issue.<br />\nThe harsh reality\u2014the reality<br />\nwhich, in part, prompted my<br />\nresignation from Student Council and the CUS at the start of this<br />\nacademic year\u2014was that the student voice on the CUS was not<br />\nas important as I had been led to<br />\nbelieve. This fact was brought into focus by an incident which<br />\ncame to my attention during the<br />\nsummer. Last spring, the CUS<br />\nconsidered a proposal concerning<br />\na B.A. degree in Engineering,<br />\nsubmitted by the Whiting School.<br />\nThe CUS rejected the proposal on<br />\nboth philosophical and intellectual<br />\ngrounds on two separate occasions. At its final meeting of the<br />\nyear, this same proposal was submitted directly to the Academic<br />\nCouncil, which approved it, over<br />\nand above the objections of the<br />\nCUS membership. The moral of<br />\nthis story is that the student body<br />\nis being shortchanged on the<br />\nCUS. The Committee on<br /><br />\nUndergraduate Studies existed, i n<br />\nmy mind, to offer students a real<br />\nopportunity to be involved in the<br />\nformulation of academic policy.<br />\nIn fact, in its current form, it is<br />\na sham, governed not by formal<br />\nrules, but by the whims of the<br />\nA&amp;S and Engineering deans. If<br />\nstudent input on a proposal is not<br />\ndeemed worthy it can be cast<br />\naside. Clearly, even a formal vote<br />\nof this body does not necessarily<br />\ncarry any weight!<br />\nIn my opinion, the student body<br />\nand its elected representatives, the<br />\nStudent Council, should not<br />\ncountenance these developments.<br />\nThe precedent for ignoring the<br />\nstudent voice in the future has<br />\nbeen firmly established. Imagine<br />\nif the deans had taken their radical<br />\nAdd/Drop proposal of two years<br />\nago directly to the Academic<br />\nCouncil after the CUS had soundly rejected it?

This<br />\nis a concept which has finally arrived. Two commentators, one<br />\nweather board, one world. All on<br />\nyour television screen. We have<br />\nto admit, at first we were a little<br />\nskeptical of the idea. Twenty-four<br />\nhours a day of Marty Bass? It<br />\nseemed too much for even the<br />\nmost jaded viewer. Yet after watching for a while, it became clear<br />\nto us that this channel deserves<br />\nspecial recognition.<br />\nWhen you wake up in the morning and find that it's pouring rain<br />\nin Baltimore, it's comforting to<br />\nturn on the Weather Channel. A<br />\nquick look reveals that the<br />\nweather's bad all over. There's<br />\na hurricane in the Caribbean.<br />\nTornado warnings are in effect<br />\nfor most of the Midwest. A small<br />\ntremor has hit the California<br />\ncoast. Two anchorpeople sequestered behind a desk calmly<br />\npresent you with all of the news.<br />\n; Suddenly it is easy to feel that you<br />\n\u2022<br />\nare part of a large community.<br />\nC Everybody has something in<br />\n\u2022 common . . . the weather. If it's<br />\nsnowing in Seattle, we can feel<br />\nan affinity for everyone that has<br />\nt.o trudge to work. If it's sunny<br />\n,in Houston, Aunt Clara is pro!. bably working on her tan. There<br />\nis no banter or debate on the<br />\n6<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 Weather Channel. No one feels<br />\ncompelled to make a joke. There<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\ne IS just the weather and a few maps<br />\n\u2022<br />\nte bringing the country together.<br />\nThat's how it ought to be.<br />\nAll of this leads us to the<br />\nfishing shows on ESPN. Upon<br /><br />\ntuning in, the sports-hungry<br />\nviewer finds an unusually serene<br />\nsetting on his screen. It's early in<br />\nthe morning, and two old men are<br />\nin a boat discussing the merits of<br />\ndifferent baits. Frogs, small fish,<br />\nand flies are all examined. It's<br />\nstill a little dark out, but you can<br />\nsee that these two are experts.<br />\nThey have all of the right equipment and an air of confidence.<br />\nAfter a while they cast their lines<br />\nout over the water. Sh00000sh<br />\n. . . whrrrrrrr . . . pl00000sh. So<br />\nthey wait and chat a little. Maybe<br />\nthey'll catch something, maybe<br />\nthey won't. Every once in a<br />\nwhile, they reel their lines in and<br />\ndiscuss things some more. They<br />\nare never in a hurry. Somehow,<br />\nthey seem to understand that no<br />\nmatter what happens it has been<br />\na good day. After all, they're<br />\nfishing, aren't they?<br />\nIf there is a connection between<br />\nthese two forms of television, it<br />\nis in their uniqueness. It's<br />\nsoothing to watch old men out on<br />\na boat or satellite pictures of a nation. After a hard day of car<br />\nchases, violence, and formula endings maybe we can use the inevitable uncertainty of fishing and<br />\nthe weather. There just might be<br />\nan essential message contained in<br />\nthese concepts. With all of the<br />\ncomplex ideas that govern our<br />\nlives, maybe all it really comes<br />\ndown to is the temperature and<br />\nwhether or not the trout are<br />\nbiting. It is in these everyday occurrences that, if only for a moment, we may all have a chance<br />\nto come together.<br /><br />\nGrad Club<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing after having read<br />\nthe article about loud music and<br />\nthe Grad club in the News-Letter<br />\nof March 9. Both the University<br />\nand the Grad club have forgotten<br />\ntwo important facts. First, people have danced to unamplified<br />\nmusic for at least several thousand years. Second, amplified<br />\ndoes not have to be loud. The<br />\nanswer to the problems at the<br />\nGrad Club is simple: keep the<br />\nvolume reasonable. Use a sound<br />\nmeter, put a limit on it, and tell<br />\nthe bands to keep the amplification low enough so that it does not<br />\nexceed the desired level.<br />\nLet me compare two different<br />\nexperiences. The first is at the<br />\nGrad Club. We went there last<br />\nyear for a rock and roll band, and<br />\nfound the volume very loud. I<br />\nasked to have it turned down to<br />\na reasonable level, but was told<br />\nthat the band liked it loud, and<br />\nloud it was going to remain. The<br />\nsecond experience is at the dances<br />\nsponsored by the Washington<br />\nSwing Dance Society. They insist<br />\non having ultimate control of the<br />\nvolume, turn it down if the band<br />\nsets it too loud, and refuse to hire<br />\nbands that don't comply with<br />\ntheir policy.<br />\nLoud noise of any kind can be<br />\nobnoxious, interfering with other<br />\nactivities, and dangerous, producing a loss of hearing, the moral<br />\nis clear. Until bands become<br />\nresponsible and keep their<br />\nvolume at a reasonable level, the<br />\nUniversity/Grad Club should put<br />\na limit on it.<br />\nFinally, I hope the University<br />\ndoes not pursue the option of<br />\nfinding a place where the music<br />\ncan be as loud as the bands want<br />\nit. such a step would be unfortunate, because it would suggest<br />\nthat the University condones the<br />\nloud volume, and sanctions the<br />\nincreased risk of hearing loss.<br />\nDavid Olton<br />\nProfessor<br />\nSee LETTERS, 9<br /><br />\nLAST CHANCE<br />\nTHIS<br />\nSEMESTER!<br /><br />\nNext GRO meeting: Wed.,<br />\nApril 11 at 5:30pm - Executive<br />\nConference Room.<br />\nGRO meetings fbr the rest of<br />\nthe semester will be on April<br />\n25, May 9 both at 5:30 p.m.<br />\nand in the Executive Conference Room.<br /><br />\nGRAD CLUB<br />\nThe planned closure of the<br />\nGrad Club will not go ahead after<br />\nall. At a meeting with Dean of<br />\nStudents Susan K. Boswell, GRO<br />\nmembers Joanne Houlahan,<br />\nRalph El-Chami, Dan Ferber,<br />\nTammy Smecker and Scott<br />\nHolupka, along with Grad Club<br />\nmanager James Wesolowsky,<br />\nreached a compromise with the<br />\nJHU administration, in this instance represented by SAC<br />\nActivities Director Bill Smedick<br />\nand Finance Director Shelly<br />\nAlbrecht.<br />\nThe Club is to be soundproofed with acoustic ties which<br />\nit is hoped will absorb most of the<br />\nnoise emanating from the<br />\npremises. Admittedly, the<br />\npopular Funk Nite will no longer<br />\nbe held in the club, being moved<br />\ninstead to the Rat (the bit of the<br />\nLevering Cafeteria with the<br />\nplastic dome.) It is not as yet clear<br />\nwhether alcohol will be served.<br />\nHowever, there will still be live<br />\nbands on Friday nights and there<br />\nwill be a DJ on Saturdays. Asked whether she thought the<br />\ncompromise would satisfy<br />\nresidents of McCoy Hall,<br />\nBoswell said she didn't know.<br />\nThe club's new lease on life was<br />\nonly on a \"trial basis.\" cAnd if<br />\nthe McCoy residents still complain, there would be little option<br />\nbut to close the place down.<br />\nWith this in mind, there has<br />\nbeen talk of moving the Grad<br />\nClub, perhaps to the disused<br />\nbuilding at 3301 N. Charles,<br />\nwhich is due for renovation over<br />\nthe next two years. However,<br />\nBoswell said no conclusions had<br />\nbeen reached. And everyone in-<br /><br />\nvolved is still \"thinking about<br />\nit<br />\nMeanwhile, the band for<br />\ntonight, March 30, is the Delta<br />\nDevils.<br />\nSo check out the club - it'll be<br />\nrockin' as usual.<br />\nGRO NOTES<br />\nAt its last meeting (Mar. 7), the<br />\nGRO heard various funding and<br />\nrecognition requests.<br />\nA delegate, Alan Barta, from<br />\nthe Hopkins chapter of Student<br />\nPugwash, U.S.A. (SPUSA) addressed the council, seeking GRO<br />\nrecognition for the Hopkins<br />\norganization. Pugwash is, he explained, an educational group<br />\ndedicated to generating interest in<br />\nthe ethical and social implications<br />\nof science and technology. The<br />\ncouncil unanimously voted to<br />\ngrant GRO recognition to the<br />\nHopkins group.<br />\nColin Vaughan, the chair of the<br />\nJHU Caribbean Interest Group<br />\n(CIG), presented a request to the<br />\ncouncil that the GRO co-sponsor<br />\na Hoppy Hour with CIG, splitting<br />\ncosts 50-50. The GRO cosponsored such an event with Clg<br />\nlast year. It was agreed to cosponsor the event to the amount<br />\nof $300.<br />\nThe Union of Jewish Graduate<br />\nStudents (JGS) presented a request for a continuation of the<br />\nfunding they received from the<br />\nGRO last semester. The principal<br />\nrequest was for funding for the<br />\ngroup's lecture series, which<br />\ndrew much campus press last<br />\nsemester. The series will consist<br />\nof six lectures, each costing $70<br />\nin honoraria. Including printing<br />\ncosts, the full extent of the<br />\nUJGS's financial needs for this<br />\nsemester is $595, though the<br />\ngroup made plain they were not<br />\nnecessarily asking the GRO for<br />\nthis amount. Nonetheless, there<br />\nwas some concern among the<br />\ncouncil members that to fund the<br />\nUJGS by too great an extent<br />\nwould be to set an unfortunate<br />\nprecedent for future petitioners to<br />\ntake heed of. A compromise<br />\nfigure of $250 was suggested.<br /><br />\nThis proposal was accepted by a<br />\nvote of 8-3.<br />\nTwo JHU Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance (GALA) officers<br />\npresented a funding request for<br />\n$200 to help defray the costs of<br />\nthe screening of two films in<br />\nApril (the 6th and 26th, tentatively). The petitioners said that grad<br />\ninterest in the Alliance was high,<br />\nespecially for its discussion<br />\ngroups. The council unanimously granted the $200.<br />\nLemniscate, a JHU literary<br />\nmagazine, presented a request for<br />\n$1000 for support with its spring<br />\n1990 edition. Council member<br />\nScott Holupka said that it seems<br />\nthat only three or four grads are<br />\ninvolved. GRO Co-Chair Joanne<br />\nHoulahan noted that seeing as<br />\nhow the magazine seems to be<br />\ndominated by Writing Seminars<br />\nmajors, and the GRO already<br />\ncontributes quite a lot to the<br />\nWriting Sems reading series, it<br />\nmight appear unseemly for the<br />\ncouncil essentially to subsidize<br />\none department by such a large<br />\namount. Secretary Munro and<br />\nMr. Holupka raised some questions as to why Lemniscate's<br />\nprinting costs ($4000) were so<br />\nhigh. Mr. Munro noted that<br />\nreducing point size might reduce<br />\nthe size of the booklet by a third,<br />\nsaving a large sum. Ms.<br />\nHoulahan suggested that the GRO<br />\nask the publishers for an exact<br />\nbreakdown of how the $4000 is<br />\nto be spent. The decision to fund<br />\nwas postponed pending.<br /><br />\nEditor: Doug Munro<br />\nUnless otherwise stated, the<br />\nviews expressed herein do not<br />\nrepresent the official position<br />\nof the GRO.<br />\nPlease submit all letters and<br />\narticles to the editor's mailbox<br />\nin Political Science by 5 p.m.<br />\nMondays.

First, let me clarify<br />\nmy remarks made at the Candidate's Forum. Mr. Silverstein<br />\nstates in his letter that I do not<br />\nrecognize racism and sexism as<br />\npotential problems at this school.<br />\nIf he were present at the Candidate's Forum, or, at the very<br />\nleast, gained some discussion<br />\nwith me'nor to writin his let-<br /><br />\nThe wolfman when the moon isn't quite full.by Rob Grofe<br /><br />\nAttention<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nStaff:<br /><br />\nter, he would know that what I<br />\nsaid was that climate issues such<br />\nas racism and sexism are problems too big for Council to handle. They are something better<br />\nsuited for organizations such as<br />\nthe Women's Center, BSU,<br />\nGALA, and the JSA. I believe<br />\nthat they, too, would agree with<br />\nthis conclusion. This is not to say,<br />\nhowever, that I would be unwilling to work with them. We have<br />\ncommon goals in that we are all<br />\ntrying to improve the quality of<br />\nstudent life here at Hopkins. Dr.<br />\nAshby's committee or any other<br />\nuniversity climate related concern<br />\nhas always and will certainly continue to have an opportunity to<br />\nvoice their opinions to Council.<br />\nMr. Silverstein is clearly being<br />\nunfair, however, to accuse this<br />\nentire campus of racist and sexist tendencies. He states that there<br />\nis an uncercurrent at this school<br />\nthat champions a racist/sexist<br />\nviewpoint. I must disagree with<br />\nthis assertion. Organizations such<br />\nas the BSU, JSA, GALA,and the<br />\nWomen's Center have made great<br />\nstrides in the three years I have<br />\nbeen here to avoid such a reality. I believe that this trend<br />\ntowards understanding will<br />\ncontinue.<br />\nThere is a misconception that<br /><br />\nit is the duty solely of Student<br />\nCouncil to cure the ills of the<br />\nUniversity. This view does not<br />\ngive other student groups enough<br />\ndeserved credit.

Student Council is just<br />\none means to this end. There are<br />\nstudent organizations out there<br />\nwho are more qualified to deal<br />\nwith certain issues. That is the<br />\nlong and short of what I meant at<br />\nthe Candidate's Forum.<br />\nI believe that this letter clarifies<br />\nthe statements I made at the Candidate's Forum.

Kern<br />\nSpalding Gray overturned the<br />\ncardboard box sitting on the table<br />\nin front of him, and out tumbled<br />\na bound manuscript that was<br />\nperhaps seven inches thick. \"This<br />\nis the monster,\" he said, explaining the title of his current<br />\nmonologue,\"Monster in a Box,\"<br />\nwhich he performed Saturday<br />\nnight as the first installment of the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art's \"Off<br />\nThe Walls\" contemporary performance series.<br />\nGray's 1400-page \"monster\"<br />\nis an autobiographical novel<br />\nentitled \"The Impossible Vacation,\" which he was commissioned to write approximately<br />\nthree years ago. But as both the<br />\nmonologue and the hulking<br />\nmanuscript made clear, Gray has<br />\nyet to finish the book. \"Monster<br />\nin a Box\" purports to explain<br />\nwhy. But Gray, interestingly,<br />\ndoesn't give away the subtext:<br />\nthat the monologue is itself<br />\nanother postponement device,<br />\ndiguised as a confession.<br />\nIn fact, Spalding Gray's thirteenth dramatic monlogue comes<br />\nacross almost like an apology\u2014<br />\nan adult's collection of excuses<br />\nfor homework not finished. Gray<br />\ncatalogs the diversions that drew<br /><br />\nMOV<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nhim eagerly away from his<br />\nwriter's desk: a trip to Nicaragua<br />\nto research a film script about<br />\nAmerican revolutionary tourists;<br />\nan invitation from a small theater<br />\ncompany to find and interview<br />\n\"people in Los Angeles who<br />\nweren't involved in the film industry\"; and a journey to the first<br />\nAmerican film festival in the<br />\nSoviet Union, where \"Swimming<br />\nto Cambodia\"(a film version of<br />\nan earlier monologue) played<br />\nalongside the likes of \"Splash,\"<br />\n\"The Empire Strikes Back,\" and<br />\n\"Cool Hand Luke.\"<br />\nFrom a stiff-backed chair<br />\nbehind a small card table, Gray<br />\nwarily unfolded the tale of his extended procrastination. Aside<br />\nfrom the manuscript and box, his<br />\nonly other companions on the<br />\nstage were a glass of water, a<br />\nsmall paperback book, and a<br />\nhighly sensitive microphone that<br />\nseemed to capture every sound he<br />\nmade. This seemed appropriate,<br />\nas Gray's narrative style is almost<br />\nabnormally intimate. He talks and<br />\ngestures as if addressing a single<br />\nperson seated right in front of<br />\nhim, even though many of the<br />\nhundreds at the sold-out performance sat over thirty yards from<br />\nthe stage. Miraculously, the<br />\nmethod works: Gray makes the<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\nintervening distance vanish, and<br />\nhis words travel with the weight<br />\nof shared secrets. The members<br />\nof tho audience become his<br />\nconfidants.<br />\nIt was appropriate for Gray to<br />\nseek confidants rather than a mere<br />\naudience, for \"Monster in a<br />\nBox,\" like many of its<br />\npredecesors, centers on Spalding<br />\nGray himself. The concept<br />\nsounds narcissistic, and perhaps<br />\nit is. But like Woody Allen in his<br />\nearly standup comedy routines,<br />\nGray often uses self-adsorption as<br />\nan excuse to examine larger<br />\nissues.<br />\nWhen in Los Angeles, he<br />\nobserves that everyone has a<br />\n\"thirty-five-mile-an-hour consciousness\"\u2014everybody drives<br />\nand nobody walks, with the result<br />\nthat people are almost oblivious<br />\nto their environment. Gray<br />\nsimilarly magnifies the nation's<br />\nAIDS panic into a personal<br />\n\"AIDS hysteria,\" triggered by<br />\nhis girlfriend's discovery of a<br />\nfestering \"spider bite\" one morning. While in Nicaragua, he<br />\nlistens to the horror stories of<br />\nmothers whose children have<br />\nbeen killed be the Contras.<br />\nUnaware of the group's main<br />\nsource of income\u2014American<br />\naid\u2014one pleads with him, \"Tell<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\n'Oscar and Me'<br />\nA Movie Critic in Front of the TV<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nSad to report, there weren't any<br />\nmajor mishaps on Monday<br />\nnight's Academy Awards.

Anyway,<br />\nMalden was at least half right.<br />\nThe first 15 minutes of the<br />\ntelecast were consumed by tight,<br />\nlove-in close ups of arriving stars,<br />\nincluding \"the very funny Chevy<br />\nChase,\" and \"the incredible<br />\nDaryl Hannah.\" Actually, Daryl<br />\nHannah was dressed as the Big<br />\nMermaid.<br />\nTrue to Oscar form, no awards<br />\nwere given out in the first half<br />\nhour, and most of the major<br />\nawards took place after midnight,<br />\nthe alleged end of the telecast. In<br />\nan industry that hardly needed an<br />\nego boost, Oscar is now a selfproclaimed Cold War-killer and<br />\nworld-shrinker. Apparently hundreds of Eastern Europeans were<br />\ntaking a break from their busy<br />\nschedule of creating democracies<br />\nto watch Randy Newman sint<br />\ntheme from \"Parenthood.\"<br />\nThere were low-quality remote<br />\npresentaitons from around the<br />\nglobe. Jack Lemmon was victimized by a vicious Siberian<br />\necho and sound troubles in<br />\nMoscow. And if the idea of<br />\nsatellite wasn't hokey enough,<br />\nNRA representative Charlton<br />\nHeston announced the documentary awards from Buenos Aires<br />\nfor no apparent reason. He flew<br />\nto Buenos Aires that day so there<br />\ncould be a fifth location. They've<br />\nbeen really starved for entertainment in Argentina since \"Evita\"<br />\nclosed. Still, the Academy could<br />\nhave saved a lot of money by<br />\nbroadcasting from Epcot Center.<br />\nWhile snubs to Steven<br />\nSpielberg have caused hysterical<br />\npress reactions in recent years, it<br /><br />\nPerformance artist Spalding Cray, who performed a new monologue at the BMA last Saturday<br /><br />\nyour president what's going on<br />\ndown here.\"<br />\nBefore cataloging the group of<br />\nimpressively unbalanced folk that<br />\nhe meets on the Los Angeles<br />\ngrant project, he tells of his<br />\n\"Platinum Card lunches\" with<br />\nstudio executives in Hollywood.<br />\nLeaning forward in his chair, he<br />\nnearly whispers, \"They wanted<br />\nto know if I had an<br />\nidea. . . .[ideas] are so rare out<br />\nthere that you can get paid<br />\n$70,000 to $100,000just for having one.\"<br />\nSuch cheap shots are rare,<br />\nhowever. Although Gray's stock<br />\nin trade is finding and exploiting<br />\nlife's absurdities, and the absurdities of people in particular, he<br />\ndoesn't esteem himself any higher<br />\nthan his prey\u2014unless, of course,<br /><br />\nwas nothing compared to the<br />\noutrage voiced this year by critics<br />\nand movie-goers over the omission of Spike Lee's \"Do the<br />\nRight Thing\" and the Spielberglike snub of \"Driving Miss<br />\nDaisy\" director Bruce Beresford.<br />\nMany of the presentors and recipients decided to take matters into<br />\ntheir own hands.<br />\nRace relations expert Kim Basinger certainly ruined her chances<br />\nof receiving the Thalberg<br />\nLifetime Achievement Award<br />\nwith her patronizing homily to<br />\nSpike Lee before introducing best<br />\npicture nominee \"Dead Poets<br />\nSociety.\" Denzel Washington,<br />\naccepting his best suporting actor award for \"Glory,\" called<br /><br />\n'True to Oscar<br />\nform, no awards<br />\nwere given out<br />\nin the first<br />\nhalf hour.<br />\nnicely done, although it was hard<br />\nto explain why the day-glo clad<br />\nscuba-divers were tap dancing.<br />\nAbdul's grotesque version of<br />\nthe best costume category,<br />\nhowever, may have set a new<br />\nOscar low. But Billy Crystal promised at the beginning of the<br />\ntelecast that there would be no<br />\nhorrifying production numbers!<br />\nHe lied to us! The costume mam-<br /><br />\nLike most great storytellers,<br />\nGray has the ability to make truth<br />\nrelative\u2014to bend or stretch facts<br />\nuntil they fit snugly into the structure of his tale. So entrancing is<br />\nhis narrative style, so compelling<br />\nare his characters, that the listener<br />\nis willing to follow him almost<br />\nanywhere. And true to form,<br />\n\"Monster in a Box\" did seem to<br />\ntravel everywhere during its ninety minutes.<br /><br />\nThe narrative leapt from New<br />\nYork City to Bali to Moscow to<br />\nLos Angeles to New Hampshire,<br />\nhopping years and juggling the<br />\nperspectives of dozens of<br />\ncharacters. Shifting between<br />\ndescriptions of the protagonist in<br />\nhis book and some partly fictionalized episodes from real life,<br />\nGray reported the difficulty he<br />\nhad in attempting to write in New<br />\nHampshire's McDowell Colony<br />\n(in a cabin called the Bates<br />\nHouse). Soon after writer's block<br />\nset in, excuses to escape the<br />\ntypewriter began to converge on<br />\nhim: First the grant project, the<br />\n\"idea lunches\" with various<br />\nHollywood executives, followed<br />\nby the trip to Nicaragua and a<br />\nchaotic string of events there.<br />\nSee MONOLOGUE, 14<br /><br />\nTHE A TER<br /><br />\nBarnstormers' Latest<br />\nSurmounts Its<br />\nScriptural Mediocrity<br />\nby Paul Bonanos<br /><br />\n'Henry V was<br />\ndoing backflips<br />\nand Valmont<br />\nwas vogueing.'<br />\nthat omitted film \"certainly one<br />\nof the best five films of the year.\"<br />\nAnd everyone associated with<br />\nwith the four Oscars from \"Driving Miss Daisy\" effusively<br />\nthanked Beresford.

Meanwhile,<br />\nHenry V was doing back flips and<br />\nValmont was vogueing.<br />\nIn another worldly and bizarre<br />\nOscar moment, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa was<br />\nhonored with a lifetime achievement award. Although one<br />\ncouldn't tell if he was laughing or<br />\ncrying, his words were<br />\nmemorable. Kurosawsa, who has<br />\nmade dozens of films and whose<br />\ncareer spans four decades, wasn't<br />\nsure if he deserved the award<br />\n\"because I don't feel I understand<br />\ncinema.\" And who says those<br />\nhumble, hardworking Japanese<br />\ncan't teach us a thing or two?<br /><br />\nAs the telecast steamrollered to<br />\na crescendo, with no more best<br />\nsong nominees or technical<br />\nawards to be handed out, the<br />\ndrama actually was palpable.<br />\nWould Spike Lee receive the<br />\nscreenwriting consolation prize?<br />\nNo, he didn't win, but the winner was sitting in his row. Would<br />\nTorn Cruise win and and announce the name of his new<br />\ngirlfriend and thus end a potential tabloid feeding frenzy? No,<br />\nhe didn't win. Would Oliver<br />\nStone sweat uncontrollably upon<br />\nreceiving the best director award,<br />\nas he did in 1986? No, he was<br />\ntanned, rested, and ready.<br />\nSo much for suspense. In fact,<br />\nSO much for the Academy<br />\nAwards show. What's one billion<br />\nminus one'?<br /><br />\nHow does a nice Jewish boy<br />\nfrom the city realize his dream of<br />\nbecoming an actor? This is the<br />\nfundamental question tackled in<br />\n\"Enter Laughing,\" the latest<br />\nBarnstormers production, which<br />\nplayed in the Arellano theatre<br />\nMarch 9 through 11.<br />\nDirected by Steve Mager and<br />\nRhoda Charles and produced by<br />\n\"Enter<br />\nMcColl,<br />\nChris<br />\nLaughing\" traces the path of<br />\nyoung David Kolowitz, fresh out<br />\nof high school and apprenticing<br />\nin carpentry at a neighborhood<br />\nbusiness, to his ultimate dream of<br />\nacting in the theatre. Art Interian,<br />\nas David, is eminently likable if<br />\nnot extraordinary; his portrayal as<br />\na nervous young man facing auditions, rehearsals, and women for<br />\nthe first time carries a delightful<br />\nschtick. And although David<br />\nrarely transcends such schtick,<br />\neven in his tensest moments, the<br />\nlaughs he manages to incite are<br />\ngenuine and loud. His companion, Marvin, from a similar<br />\nbackground and played by Ben<br />\nTownsend, seems less comfortable with his part but acts as a<br />\nperfect foil.<br />\nDavid begins working as a simple carpenter in a shop for the<br />\naptly named Mr. Foreman. He<br />\nsoon becomes inspired to take<br />\nnight acting school which, for a<br />\ncompletely inexperienced actor,<br />\ncan be pretty frightening, as<br />\nDavid discovers the hard way. He<br />\nmanages, however, to swallow<br />\nsome pride and overcome his<br />\nfears\u2014barely\u2014to muster an audition, where he is chosen for the<br />\npart by leading lady Angela<br />\nMarlowe, despite his more-thanobvious inabilities. Angela(Susan<br />\nPlano) interacts with David<br />\nperfectly, as her efforts to relax<br />\nhim for their love scenes<br /><br />\nbackfire, causing only more<br />\nnerves for poor David. These efforts are, predictably, misinterpreted by David's sweetheart<br />\nWanda (Adrienne Lamb), whose<br />\nchemistry with Interian is executed with fine aplomb.<br />\n\"Enter Laughing\" is a comedy, after all, and its funniest<br />\nmoments are largely contained in<br />\nthe slapstick of David's botched<br />\nrehearsals. But the real comic<br />\nshow-stealers are Dave Howe and<br />\nRebecca Garron, who are obviously well rehearsed as the<br />\nstereotypical, bickering, overworrying Kolowitz parents. Their<br />\nrapid-fire conversations and taut<br />\ncontrol evidence true comic talent<br />\nwhile creating a pair of highly<br />\nbelievable characters.<br />\nYet the play's more serious<br />\nmoments are handled quite<br />\ncapably as well. David and<br />\nWanda's sorrowful near breakup<br />\nand subsequent reconciliation<br />\narouse genuine pathos, and the<br />\nbattles with his parents and their<br />\nattempt to remove him from acting school evoke a tangible sense<br />\nof disappointment.<br />\nOn the whole, though, \"Enter<br />\nLaughing\" seems to be like a cartoon with serious moments.<br />\nSlapstick humor, predictable endings, and basic sitcom ups and<br />\ndowns leave much room for the<br />\nplayers to make or break the performance. Its cartoonish nature is<br />\ncertainly positive, though; it adds<br />\nto the inherent humor in David's<br />\nplight. The ending, predictably,<br />\nresults in David's realization of<br />\nhis dream, but David's performance makes it entirely<br />\nbelievable. A well rehearsed,<br />\nwell supported cast is what<br />\nsalvages \"Enter Laughing\" from<br />\nits scriptual mediocrity and<br />\nelevates it to a truly enjoyable<br />\nlevel.<br /><br />\nRECORDS<br /><br />\nA Sweeping Survey\u2014<br />\nDepeche Mode, Nitzer<br />\nEbb, The Beloved<br />\nAnd The Blue Nile<br /><br />\nWANT TO BE<br />\nA PEER<br />\nCOUNSELOR?!<br />\nInformation session<br />\nTuesday, April 3<br />\n7:00 PM<br />\nAMR I TV Room<br /><br />\nby John H.

It's<br />\nwell-worn territory for Depeche<br />\nMode, of course, exploited to the<br />\nextreme on their \"Black Celebration\" LP, yet their pursuit of<br />\nemotional decay is tempered here<br />\nby something approaching insight, as on \"Halo,\" where<br />\nDavid Gahan sings, \"You wear<br />\nguilt like shackles on your feet,<br />\nlike a halo in reverse.\" Or<br />\n\"Clean\": \"As years go by, all<br />\nthe feelings inside twist and they<br />\nturn, as they ride with the tide.\"<br />\nIt's all delivered with a certain<br />\ncamp vigor that wavers between<br />\nbrooding humor and intense selfconsciousness, and backed by<br />\nsome extremely alluring<br />\n\"Eminently<br />\nmelodies.<br />\nlistenable,\" as they say. I'd say<br />\nthis is their best yet, but that's<br />\nkind of like saying that the worst<br />\nsex you'll ever have will still be<br />\npretty good.<br />\nConsidering \"Showtime\"<br />\n(Geffen), the third album by<br />\nNitzer Ebb, simple supply and<br />\ndemand tells me that someone<br />\nwants records like this, but who<br />\nare they'? Nitzer Ebb are to<br />\nDepeche Mode what Racer X was<br />\nto Speed Racer: seemingly more<br />\nevil but, predictably enough, really just an innocent extension of<br />\nthe other. On \"Showtime\"<br />\nNitzer Ebb forgets the agreeable<br />\nTeutonic funk of their last LP,<br />\n\"Belief,\" and returns to a rawer,<br />\nthroatier delivery reminiscent Of<br />\nthe mid-Eighties industrial<br />\nbleatings of Test Department.<br />\nThis is the sort of album a nascent new-waver who gets half his<br />\nhead shaved every month at the<br />\nmall can buy and kick his<br />\nbrother's ass to.

But at least Nitzer Ebb<br />\nhas a sense of irony about their<br />\njob; or as they drily admit on the<br /><br />\nalbum's closer, \"Fun to be had.\"<br />\nOn \"Friendly As A Hand<br />\nGrenade\"(TVT), Depeche Mode<br />\ncompatriots Tackhead release a<br />\npungent burst of industry and<br />\nfunk that will tickle your<br />\ncerebellum as it clobbers you<br />\nwith its limber, Tyson-sized bass<br />\nnotes and spicy guitar licks.<br />\nTackhead embraces a kitchen<br />\nsink ethic where sampled<br />\ndialogue, Bernard Fowler's inter-<br /><br />\nThe members of The Blue Nile (top) and Nitzer Ebb<br /><br />\nmittent soulful vocals, and<br />\nvarious found-sounds-mademusic all coalesce into a tight<br />\nsphincter of Oz-like wisdom.<br />\nProducer extraordinaire and selfstyled \"master mixologist\"<br />\nAdrian Sherwood leads former<br />\nSugarhill rhythm mates Doug<br />\nWimbish and Keith LeBlanc<br />\nthrough the paces with a touch<br />\nmore finesse than on the last LP,<br />\nthe classic must-hear-to-believe<br />\n\"Gary Clail's Tackhead Sound<br />\nSystem\" (Nettwerk/Capitol),<br />\nleaving \"Friendly\" a bit dense<br />\nand melodic by contrast, though<br />\nfar from diluted. Check the<br />\nzaniness of Prince Buster's \"ska<br />\ntrek\" as pureed by the Tackhead<br />\nblender, or the parodic \"demolition house\" which takes a Ginsu<br />\nblade to every disco paradigm<br />\nyou ever hated.<br />\nWish I could say the same for<br />\n\"Happiness\" (Atlantic) by The<br />\nBeloved, a British duo based on<br />\nErasure save that these two have<br />\ntesticles and eschew rubber<br />\nclothing.

Vivian (Julia Roberts) is not even<br />\nclassy enough to be a call girl\u2014<br />\nshe's nothing more than a cheap<br />\nhooker with a sense of humor.<br />\nCorporate raider Edward Louis<br />\n(Richard Gere) asks her for directions and ends up hiring her for<br />\nthe week, breaking down his<br />\nMBA-world into digestible prostitute parts. Roberts is charming,<br />\nand Gere seems to have settled<br />\nnicely into a middle-aged maturity. \"We're similar creatures,\"<br />\nhis character says. \"We both<br />\nscrew people for money.\" The<br />\nfilm tries to be tender, and it<br />\nmostly succeeds. But there is<br />\nsomething somewhat unsettling<br />\n(and almost incestuous) about<br />\nyoung Hollywood trash as older<br />\nman's object, even a pampered<br /><br />\none. J. F. Lawton's script needs<br />\nto do a little better job of chiseling motives out of beautiful<br />\nbodies, since the last thing \"Pretty Woman\" wants is for the audience to feel guilty about liking<br />\nit.<br />\nHouse Party<br />\nReginald Hudson's first feature<br />\nis a meandering exploration of<br />\nmiddle class black life that almost<br />\nsucceeds even though it goes<br />\nnowhere. Kid (Christopher Reid,<br />\nfrom the rap group Kids N' Play)<br />\nis the high school stooge, provoking the ire of the bullies (Full<br />\nForce) and a little attention from<br />\nlunchroom beauties (Tisha Campbell and A. J. Johnson). Reid<br />\nseems remarkably at ease, despite<br />\nthe notorious sky-high hairdo that<br />\ngives him a presence of perpetual<br />\namazement. He's grounded by<br />\nhis grumbling father (the late<br />\nRobin Harris), but is sure that he<br />\ncan't miss the party thrown by<br /><br />\nbest friend Play (Christopher<br />\nMartin). Soon the usual John<br />\nHughesian high school minidramas unfold, but it is nice to see<br />\nmiddle-class blacks receive a little cinematic attention for once.<br />\nHudson, who wrote and directed,<br />\nscores some points with his less<br />\nthan subtle caricature of the racist<br />\nliberties taken by white<br />\npolicemen. But he neglects the<br />\nbest aspects of his plot and takes<br />\nthe film in ordinary directions,<br />\nsapping the life out of an otherwise fresh and polished tale.<br />\nThe Hunt for Red October<br />\nTom Clancy's mega-bestselling<br /><br />\nnovel is transformed by director<br />\nJohn McTiernan into a bloated<br />\nvessel, an exercize in waterlogged boredom. Soviet submarine<br />\ncaptain Marko Alexandovich<br />\nRamius(Sean Connery with hair<br />\nplugs) violates military orders and<br />\nsends his super-advanced nuclear<br />\nsubmarine hurtling towards<br />\nfriendly American ports. The<br />\nUnited States government braces<br />\nfor the Big One, but perky CIA<br />\nanalyst Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin)<br />\nfigures out that Ramius is really<br />\ntrying to defect. Thus, as the ad<br />\nputs it, \"the hunt is on.\" And on,<br />\nand on, and on. Baldwin is incredible as Ryan, the transform-<br /><br />\nRichard Gere and Julia Roberts (above left) wander about in a scene,<br />\nfrom \"Pretty Woman.\" Above is Tom Hanks in John Patrick Shanley's;<br />\n\"Joe Versus the Volcano.\"<br />\ned sap, but poor motive development in the script (by Larry<br />\nFerguson and Mark Stewart)<br />\nhangs Connery out to dry.<br />\nRamius is neither glorified nor<br />\npathetic: he just drifts somewhere<br />\nin between. Simply put, all the<br />\nelements that make \"Red October\" such a satisfying read\u2014<br />\ngritty details of docking collars<br />\nand propulsion systems\u2014don't<br /><br />\ntranslate.

The<br />\nyoung'actors are competent and<br />\nenergetic, but without Golding's<br />\ndescriptions one has to dig awfully deep to fathom the larger<br />\nthemes that are allegedly etched<br />\non their faces. Once the necessary<br />\nAmericana details begin to fade,<br />\n\"Lord\" weaves an unimpeded,<br />\ndisturbing narrative.

The<br />\nfilm is a virtual replica of\"We're<br />\nNo Angels,\" from last<br />\nChristmas: believe it or not,<br />\ncriminal redemption in a religious<br />\ncontext is still unengaging,<br />\npredictable, and unfunny.<br />\nClatrane throws around his<br />\n(substantial) comic weight, but<br />\nIdle has a look that alternates between shock and fatigue. Perhaps<br />\nit's because he's also asked to<br />\nplay a romantic lead, which is<br />\nabout as convincing as Tom<br />\nCruise doing Shakespeare. Or<br />\nbecause he knows that the comic<br />\npremise of the film isn't substantial enough to warrant a ten<br />\nminute Monty Python sketch.<br /><br />\nAmerican Panascope, \"home of<br />\nthe rectal probe.\" When he's<br />\ndiagnosed with a terminal brain<br />\nclot and given the chance to jump<br />\ninto a volcano for an eccentric<br />\nbusinessman (the delightful Lloyd<br />\nBridges), Banks sets sail, and<br />\nShanley pulls out the stops. The<br />\nfilm works within familiar<br />\nlocales, but takes the extra tiny<br />\nsteps to remind the audience that<br />\nthis is some sort of alternate reality. Ryan is impressive in three<br />\ndifferent roles, each time selling<br />\nthe fact that she's not the<br />\ncharacter she was before.

Dr.<br />\nDavid Olton, a psychology professor here at Hopkins, has been<br />\nswing dancing for years. He and<br />\nTodd Tenenholz, a Hopkins<br />\ngraduate student, organized the<br />\nprogram in which participants<br />\nfirst learned how to dance and<br />\nthen got the chance to show off<br />\ntheir skill at a local swing dance<br />\nclub.<br />\nThe response was overwhelming. Though a 12 person limit<br />\nwas placed on the program, 18<br />\npeople were eventually allowed to<br />\nparticipate. The nine couples first<br />\nlearned the basic steps during the<br />\nfirst two Wednesday nights(even<br />\na Mol Cell exam the following<br />\nThursday did not deter them).<br />\nThey then used those steps the<br />\nfollowing Tuesday, March 6, at<br />\nThe Bop Shop, a Baltimore swing<br />\ndance club.

The form he was<br />\nteaching was the six-count jitterbug as opposed to the eight-count<br />\nlindy.

Baughan, director of<br />\nthe Office of Career Counseling<br />\nand Placement (CCP), says that<br />\nChristmas break is a good time<br />\nto start the job hunt, whether you<br />\nare a graduating senior looking<br />\nfor a full time job or a returning<br />\nstudent looking for summer<br />\nemployment. \"Some seniors<br />\ncome to me for the first time on<br /><br />\nMay 5, expecting to find a job.<br />\nIt isn't that easy.\"<br />\nThe application process for<br />\nsummer jobs is identical to that<br />\nfor full-time jobs. It's all about<br />\nselling your abilities. The first<br />\nstep is to write a resume. If you<br />\nhave a resume written before you<br />\ncontact employers you can send<br />\none whenever you get a lead.<br />\nWith the resume written, you<br />\nare in a position to contact prospective employers. The CCP has<br />\ncompiled information books on<br />\nmany companies, and they<br />\nreceive several different career<br />\nplacement brochures in which<br />\ncompanies advertise themselves.<br />\nIf you exhaust those sources,<br />\nyou could try networking. Ask<br />\nyou parents and other relatives to<br />\nlook into job opportunities<br />\nthrough the business contacts they<br />\nknow. Send them copies of your<br />\nresume so they can help spread<br />\nthe word about your abilities. Just<br />\nkeep in mind that your parents<br />\ncan only introduce you to prospective employers.<br />\nAfter you contact a few<br />\nbusinesses, you should be<br />\nprepared to follow up your initial<br />\nefforts. Contact CCP for more<br />\ntips, and in the fall semester look<br />\nfor notices for the job applicatoin<br />\nworkshops that CCP holds.<br />\nFor returning undergraduates,<br />\nan alternative to a paid summer<br />\njob is an internship. According to<br />\nDr. J.D. Goodyear, the academic<br />\nadvisor who coordinates internships, the application process and<br /><br />\nresponsibilities of an internship<br />\nare similar to a summer job. An<br />\ninternship is generally unpaid,<br />\nthough a faculty-sponsored internship done in Baltimore and<br />\nWashington, D.C. areas may be<br />\ncredited for a maximum of three<br />\ncredits.<br />\nDr. Goodyear cautions,<br />\nthough, that \"basically, you don't<br />\ndo an internship for credit, you<br />\ndo it for the line on the resume.\"<br />\nChoosing an internship requires<br />\nmore planning than deciding<br />\nwhich summer job to take. If you<br />\nalready have have an idea of your<br />\npost-graduate plans, you can<br />\nthink of an internship as a way to<br />\nget first hand experience in a<br />\nfuture job. Contact Dr. Goodyear<br />\nat the Office of Academic Advising for more information.<br />\nIf you decide to hunt for a job<br />\nat somewhere other than the<br />\nburger joint down the street, keep<br />\na few pointers in mind. You<br />\nshould start the application process early, and you should be<br />\nprepared to dedicate time to<br />\nwriting a resume, contacting<br />\npotential employers, and following up. Most important, keep in<br />\nmind that throughout the application process, your are selling your<br />\nabilities.

For many knowing the theory is required of<br />\nstudents and for Dr. Andreou, it an engineer.\" To better undersis quite an exciting experience tand the difference between just<br />\nhaving hands on experience with learning the theory of designing<br />\nthe world's most modern cir- chips as compared to actually go-<br /><br />\ning through the motions, consider<br />\nthe analogy of someone that just<br />\nread about how to swim as compared to someone who splashed<br />\naround in the water trying to learn<br />\nabout how to swim. While, they<br />\nboth know the basics of swimming, clearly the one with handson experience will be better<br />\nprepared when he/she falls overboard into the ocean.<br />\nUnfortunately though, most of<br />\nthe students in Dr. Andreou's<br />\nclass are at the stage of splashing<br />\naround in the water. Although<br />\nthey all were able to design an<br />\namplifier, they are not all sure it<br />\nwill work and they all have to<br />\ncomplete the circle by testing<br />\ntheir chips (which are due back<br />\nat Hopkins at the end of April).<br />\nMost of the students were relieved to just finish their design,<br />\nthough, and will worry about<br />\ntesting it later. One student, who<br />\nspent two entire days(and nights)<br />\nat a computer terminal trying to<br />\noptimize the circuit, said that<br />\n\"although [she] learned a ton,<br />\n[she] still is not sure her chip will<br />\nmeet the design requirements.\"<br />\nAt the other end of the spectrum,<br />\nanother student explained that \"it<br />\nwas no big deal. We went in,<br />\ndrew our design, met with Dr.<br />\nAndreou, and we were out.\" Incidentally, some students were<br />\nambitious enough to make two<br />\ndifferent amplifiers so that they<br />\ncan compare the design<br />\ncharacteFistics of each type.<br />\nDr. Andreou plans to continue<br />\nthe class into the next semester<br />\nfor the students who are exceptionally interested in integrated<br />\ncircuit design. He would like<br />\nstudents in that class to \"finish<br />\nthe experiment cycle,\" in the<br />\nsense that they would have<br />\nalready taken the results of their<br />\nown design, evaluated and tested<br />\ntheir design, and finally complete<br />\nthe circle by improving on their<br />\ndesign. Dr. Andreou explained<br /><br />\nThe Squid<br />\nHow do FAXes work?<br />\nWhen you load in your transmittal, the fax scans it and converts it<br />\nto code: zero for a white spot, one for a black spot.

He truly feels that<br />\nthe \"students are the basic<br />\nresource\" of an educational institution, and that right now, its<br />\n\"almost like a waste undergrads<br />\ndon't see the research laboratories<br />\nin the EE department.\"<br />\nThus, Dr. Andreou taught this<br />\nclass in an attempt to improve the<br />\ncurriculum for the students. He<br />\nwent On to explain that the improvement is limited by the<br />\nfacilities of the electrical<br />\nengineering department itself. He<br />\nwas upset that he had to use his<br />\nown research facilities and computers for the class and explained that the Hopkins electrical<br />\nengineering department \"won't<br />\nbe able to compete [with the other<br />\nhigh-tech schools] unless the<br />\nfacilities are improved.\" One of<br />\nthe major improvements he hopes<br />\nfor is upgrading the EE department's computing facilities,<br />\nwhich are now in \"the era of the<br />\n1970s\" to the \"era of the<br />\n1990s.\"<br /><br />\nScientists from Italy and the<br />\nBronx may have discovered why<br />\nwomen get drunker than men on<br />\nthe same amount of liquor, and<br />\nwhy women alcoholics are more<br />\nlikely to develop alcohol-related<br />\nliver disease.

The Blue Jays surprised everyone by beating<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall on the road<br />\nto advance to the third round of<br />\nthe tournament before losing<br />\n79-69 to fifth ranked Western<br />\nConnecticut. Hopkins won the<br />\nconsolation game against<br />\nStockton State the following day<br />\nto finish the year at 20-8.<br /><br />\nWestern Connecticut's physical<br />\nstyle of play, tight man-to-man<br />\ndefense, overall size and<br />\nathleticism, and experience proved too much for the Blue Jays,<br />\nwho battled from behind for the<br />\nentire second half but could never<br />\ncatch the Colonials. Hopkins<br />\ntrailed by three at the half, 36-33,<br />\nthe same halftime deficit they faced in the Franklin &amp; Marshall<br />\ngame. This time, however,<br />\nWestern Connecticut's insideoutside tandem, William Shepard<br />\nand Gerry Corrigan, took control<br />\nof the game, scoring 9 and 10<br />\npoints, respectively, in the first<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br /><br />\nDave Eikenberg (on ground) helped guide the Jays to the Sweet Sixteen.<br /><br />\n12 minutes of the second half to<br />\nhelp the Colonials to a 61-51<br />\nlead. Hopkins staged a 9-0 run,<br />\nhighlighted by two field goals by<br />\nsophomore Evan Jones and a<br />\nthree-point play by Jay Gangemi<br />\nto cut the lead to 61-60 with five<br />\nminutes to play. But the Jays<br />\ncould not take the lead, as two<br />\nbuckets by Corrigan and a fastbreak layup gave Western Connecticut a comfortable seven<br />\npoint lead with 3:45 left. Hopkins<br />\ngot no closer than five the rest of<br />\nthe way.<br />\n\"At that point [61-60], we<br />\ndidn't have much left,\" said head<br />\ncoach Bob Nelson. \"We battled<br />\nback from twelve down [52-40],<br />\nand I think making up that deficit<br />\ntook its toll. They are bigger and<br />\nstronger than we are and they<br />\nplayed like seniors.\" Western<br />\nfeatures four starting seniors,<br />\nwhile Hopkins has no seniors<br />\namong its top six players.<br />\nThe referees, who were<br />\ncriticized by many of the Hopkins<br />\nfaithful, called a \"let-them-play\"<br />\ntype of game that greatly favored<br />\nWestern Connecticut, whose<br />\nplayers vigorously challenge the<br />\ndribble and constantly reach in<br />\nand try to strip the ball loose.<br />\nHopkins employs less of a gambling, physical style of defense and<br />\nwere unable to take advantage of<br />\nthe referee's reluctant whistles.<br />\n\"A physical game definitely goes<br />\nto our opponent's advantage<br />\nbecause we aren't a physical<br />\nteam,\" said Nelson. \"We go a<br />\nlong way with our starters and try<br />\nnot to get into foul trouble.\"<br />\nNelson, however, refused to<br />\npin any blame on the refs, even<br />\nthough junior Andy Enfield was<br />\nknocked to the floor on at least<br />\nthree occasions without a foul being called. \"In the first half, we<br />\nhad trouble stopping them inside,<br />\nespecially [center Gary] Bestman<br />\nand Shepard,\" said Nelson. Each<br />\nhad ten points at the intermission.<br />\n\"Then Corrigan got hot in the second half.\" That he did, and he<br />\nhad little trouble getting off<br /><br />\nunobstructed shots. Corrigan used his quickness and took advantage of many screens from his<br />\nteammates when he was guarded<br />\nby Enfield, and simply shot over<br />\nthe smaller David Eikenberg.<br />\nCorrigan finished with 21 points<br />\non 10-of-14 shooting. \"We [the<br />\ncoaching staff] should have done<br />\na better job of instructing the<br />\nplayers on how to guard him,\"<br />\nNelson said later. \"If I had to do<br />\nanything different, I'd have given<br />\nEnfield more help on defense.\"<br />\nEnfield kept Hopkins in the<br />\ngame by pouring in 27 points, including 12-of-12 from the line.<br />\nJones and junior Bill Zahn were<br />\nable to keep the Colonials off<br />\nHopkins' defensive boards, notching 16 rebounds between them.<br />\nThe Jays were also able to stay<br />\nclose by preventing Western from<br />\nturning the game into a run-andgun, high turnover affair. \"They<br />\nexecute their offense as well as<br />\nany team we've played,\" commented Western head coach Bob<br />\nCampbell. Enfield was unable to<br />\nget open by running around<br />\nscreens, as the Western guards<br />\noverplayed him at all times. Enfield countered with preplanned back door cuts, or the<br />\n\"cross\" play. Sometimes, Enfield would even signal the play<br />\nto Eikenberg (by crossing his<br />\narms) right in front of the<br />\nWestern defender, then immediately slip back-door where<br />\nEikenberg would hit him with a<br />\nquick pass.<br />\nHopkins rebounded to win the<br />\nconsolation game the following<br />\nnight against Stockton State,<br />\nwhich had been edged by<br />\nWashington College. Hopkins<br />\nfell behind 28-13 ten minutes into the game. \"I was thinking,<br />\n'this could be a real blowout' at<br />\nthe time,\" said Nelson. Indeed,<br />\nthe Jays could have easily rolled<br />\nover and just played out the<br />\nseason. But they didn't. \"These<br />\nkids have a lot of pride,\" said<br />\nNelson. \"Our bench came in and<br />\ndid a good job, especially [senior]<br /><br />\nKevin Roller. [Freshman] Danny Knee and [senior Joel] Siepierski played well too. When the<br />\nstarters went back in they had a<br />\nnew lease on life. And then<br />\n[sophomore Jay] Gangemi got<br />\nhot.\" Gangemi scored nine points<br />\nin the last six minutes of the first<br />\nhalf to help cut the margin to<br />\neight, 44-36, by halftime.<br />\nThe Jays simply dominated the<br />\nsecond half, outscoring Stockton<br />\nSt. 44-30 to win 80-74. Gangemi<br />\nled the way with 34 points, including 4-of-7 three pointers, and<br />\nsix rebounds. Enfield chipped in<br />\n23, and Zahn and Jones again rebounded well, pulling down a<br />\ntotal of 17. The come back gave<br />\nthe Jays win number 20, the<br />\nhighest total in Hopkins history.<br />\nThe Jays also set the record for<br />\nthe most consecutive successful<br />\nfree throws in the tournament by<br />\nhitting 37 straight in the two<br />\ngames. Enfield alone was<br />\n18-of-18.<br />\n\"It was a successful season,\"<br />\nsaid Enfield. \"I think we went a<br />\nlot farther than other people expected us to. But I thought we had<br />\nthe talent all along.\" Part of that<br />\nuntapped talent in the form of<br />\nJones, who suddenly came alive<br />\nhalfway through the season.<br />\nJones began playing a great<br />\noverall game: posting up, scoring inside, passing, rebounding,<br />\nand even outside shooting. \"He<br />\njust played great,\" said Enfield.<br />\n\"That was one of the reasons I<br />\nthought we had the talent at the<br />\nbeginning of the year.\"<br />\nEnfield had an outstanding year<br />\nhimself, finishing with a team<br />\nleading 21.6 scoring average. He<br />\nalso finished the year with a 92.6<br />\nfree throw percentage. On the<br />\nseason he hit 137 and missed 11.<br />\nHe ended on a 34-of-35 streak.<br />\nEnfield made GTE second-team<br />\ncollege division Academic AllAmerica, which includes all Division II and Division III players.<br />\nThe award honors those athletes<br />\nwho have excelled on the court<br />\nand in the classroom.<br /><br />\nJay Gangemi emerged to<br />\nbecome the number two scorer in<br />\naveraging 16.4 ppg and Shooting<br />\n48 percent. He is also Hopkins'<br />\nbest defensive player, and if his<br />\noften-injured ankles hold up, he<br />\nshould be even more of a force<br />\nnext year.<br />\nOne pleasant surprise was the<br />\nemergence of Eikenberg as the<br />\nman who runs the show on the<br />\ncourt for Hopkins, both at the offensive and defensive end.<br />\nEikenberg was thrust into full<br />\ntime point guard duties when<br />\nDavid Strong went down with a<br />\nback injury. Strong, who has<br />\nbeen called \"Eikenberg with a<br />\njump shot,\" is expected back next<br />\nseason, which will give the Jays<br />\nmore depth at that position.<br />\n\"Eikenberg is the guy on the<br />\nteam that we could least afford to<br />\nlose,\" said Nelson, a strong statement considering Enfield and<br />\nGangemi score half of Hopkins'<br />\npoints. Like Jones, Eikenberg<br />\nsuddenly became more of an offensive force about halfway<br />\nthrough the season. He started<br />\nlooking to shoot off his drives to<br />\nthe basket rather than always<br />\npassing, presenting a greater<br />\nthreat to the defense.<br />\nNelson is also hoping for some<br />\ntop recruits to choose Hopkins.<br />\nOne of his targets is a 6'6\"<br />\nplayer, who would give the Jays<br />\nsome needed size inside. Next<br />\nyear's team will definitely have<br />\none advantage over this year's<br />\nsquad, more experience. Enfield,<br />\nEikenberg, and Zahn will be<br />\nseniors and Gangemi and Jones<br />\nwill be juniors, and the team has<br />\ngotten a good taste of tournament<br />\npressure. When asked if he<br />\nthought the Jays could advance<br />\nfarther in the tournament next<br />\nyear, Enfield responded,<br />\n\"definitely. We have to handle<br />\npressure situations bettec, and be<br />\nable to adjust to different teams<br />\nwith different styles of play. I<br />\nthink we'll have the experience to<br />\ndo that.\"<br /><br />\nMen's lacrosse suffers early setbacks<br />\nby Josh Orenstein<br />\nBefore the season began, coach<br />\nDon Zimmerman said that he<br />\nbelieved the Blue Jays needed to<br />\nstruggle in order to succeed this<br />\nyear.

So, if the team sounds<br />\nupset, it is only because they<br />\ndidn't win every game.<br />\nTalk to coach Babb and you<br />\nmight think this team had a losing record.<br />\n\"I'm disappointed with the<br />\nway we are playing,\" says Babb.<br />\n\"We need to make the routine<br />\nplays, hit with runners in scoring<br />\npositions, make the key pitches,<br />\nand pick up our overall game. We<br />\nneed to play like the veteran team<br />\nwe are.\"<br />\nOn Tuesday, the Jays hosted<br />\nWestern Maryland and were<br />\nbeaten 12-4, leaving the team<br />\nwith a 13-5 record overall.<br />\nThe game did not start out well<br />\nas Brock Bowman gave up hits to<br />\nthe first four batters. By the end<br />\nof the inning, the Jays were down<br />\n4-0. By the end of two, it was<br />\n5-0. The Jays rallied back, scoring four runs, but couldn't get<br />\nanother hit with runners in scor-<br /><br />\ning position. After that, it was all<br />\nWestern Maryland. It was not a<br />\npretty game to watch as the Jay's<br />\npitching gave up walks while the<br />\ndefense committed some errors.<br />\nThe team's next game is against<br />\nGettysburg, one of the stronger<br />\nopponents on this season's<br />\nschedule.<br />\nOne thing to note is that due to<br />\nlast year's 3rd place finish nationally, opposing managers will<br />\nthrow their best pitcher against<br />\nthe Jays and the team will be up<br />\nfor the Jays. The end product of<br />\nthis is a tough game for the team,<br />\nevery time they take the field.<br />\nIf the team sounds a bit critical<br />\nof themselves, it is only because<br />\nthey realize they are capable<br />\nof playing better baseball than<br />\ntheir record shows.<br />\nThe Jays return to Homewood<br />\nnext weekend for a Saturday<br />\ndoubleheader against Ursinus and<br />\na Sunday pair against York.<br />\nBefore the homestand, Hopkins<br />\ntravels for a doubleheader tomorrow at Widener and a single game<br />\nThursday at Dickinson.<br /><br />\nHockey earns playoff spot<br />\nFaces Bucknell Monday in Semi's<br />\nby Jay Calkins<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins ice hockey<br />\nteam finished its regular season<br />\nin impressive fashion as it won its<br />\nlast three contests in order to<br />\nclinch third place in the MasonDixon Ice Hockey League and a<br />\nspot in the league's playoffs. The<br />\nteam finished at 13-7-1 overall<br />\nand 8-5-1 in the Mason-Dixon<br />\nLeague.<br />\nIn their first game against Gettysburg, the Blue Jays got<br />\noutstanding goaltending from<br />\nDavid Bowyer, which kept them<br />\nin the game long enough to allow<br />\nthe offense of Hopkins to finally<br />\nbreak through.<br />\nIn the opening two periods, the<br />\nBullets dominated the action as<br />\nthey outshot Hopkins 30-10. Only<br />\none of their shots was able to beat<br />\nBowyer, however, as many of his<br />\n29 saves were spectacular.<br />\n\"Dave's the toughest goalie in<br />\nthe league, and when he's hot<br />\nyou're just not going to get it by<br />\nhim unless you make a really<br />\nspecial effort,\" commented Captain Mike Holmes. The Bullets<br />\nwould agree.<br />\nTrailing 1-0 to open the third<br />\nperiod, the Jays looked to get the<br />\noffense moving. In the opening<br />\nshift, center Jack Calkins was<br />\nable to get the faceoff to<br />\ndefenseman Chad Holien. Holien<br />\nhit freshman winger Jason<br />\nSprague streaking down the left<br />\nside with a beautiful pass.<br />\nSprague deftly avoided the<br />\ndefense of Gettysburg, but found<br />\nhimself without a good shooting<br />\nangle. Sprague elected to pass<br />\nback to the point where Holien let<br />\na blistering slapshot fly. The Gettysburg goaltender was Screened<br />\non the play, and the puck went<br />\nuntouched into the upper left corner to knot the score at 1-1.<br />\nHopkins proved unable to sustain the momentum as the team<br /><br />\nwas put on the defensive for most<br />\nof the period. Bowyer and Co.<br />\nwere up to the task, however, as<br />\nthey continuously thwarted good<br />\nopportunities for the Bullets.<br />\nWith only a minute to play, the<br />\nJays caught a break. While attempting to clear the puck from<br />\nbehind his net, the Gettysburg<br /><br />\ngoaltender threw the puck right<br />\nto Hopkins defenseman Craig<br />\nHampton. Hampton instantly<br />\nfired the puck into the open net<br />\nwhich enabled Hopkins to escape<br />\nwith a 2-1 victory.<br />\n\"This win can be credited to<br />\nSee SLAPSHOT, 20<br /><br />\nEXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY to earn<br />\nmoney year round/ Flexible hours<br />\nEntertainers...Male &amp; Female<br />\nDANCERS, singers, clowns, magi-'<br />\ncians, mimes, impressionists,<br />\ncomedians, jugglers, musicians,<br />\netc.<br />\nHosts...Waiters, waitresses, barmaids, bartenders, etc.<br />\nMust live in Baltimore or surrounding counties and have own transportation.<br />\nNO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY<br />\nSend resume and photo to:<br />\n6602 Hampnett Ave.<br />\nBaltimore, MD 21214<br />\nAny further<br />\nChris<br />\nWayne<br />\nJennie<br /><br />\nquestions call:<br />\n247-4150<br />\n426-7298<br />\n882-5702<br /><br />\nBoth the men's and women's<br />\nsquads of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nswimming and diving team<br />\nfinished the season in fine style<br />\nas each captured a place in the top<br />\nten teams at their respective Division III NCAA Championships.<br />\nOn Tuesday, March 5, the<br />\nwomen's squad travelled to<br />\nin<br />\n'Williams<br />\nCollege,<br />\nWilliamstown, MA, for a tough<br />\nweekend of competition which<br />\nwould end with the team in tenth<br />\nposition.

The win ensured<br />\na spot for the Jays in next week's<br />\npostseason play.<br />\n\"We're really happy that the<br />\nseason went so well\u2014but we're<br />\nnot satisfied,\" said Alfi. \"This<br />\nteam still has a lot of desire, and<br />\nwe're focused on the playoffs.\"<br />\nThe Jays take on Bucknell<br />\nMonday at 9:45 p.m. in the opening round with the winner to face<br />\nGeorgetown in the final, Thursday, April 5 at 9:45 p.m. The<br />\nHoyas knocked off UMBC 4-2 on<br />\nMonday night in the first<br />\nsemifinal.<br /><br />\nThe men's tennis team embarked on its quest for a next-toperfect season\u2014the lone loss exlected to be against perennial<br />\npowerhouse Washington College<br />\n\u2014and quickly had that goal shattered by Catholic University last<br />\nTuesday. Hopkins was missing<br />\ntwo of its top five players, Lorin<br />\nEngquist and Ted Roth, because<br />\nof class conflicts, forcing<br />\neveryone else to move up two<br />\nslots and two reserve players step<br />\nup to play #5 and #6 singles.<br />\nFortunately for Hopkins, one<br />\nof those reserves was junior Jon<br />\nMissner, who started all of last<br />\nseason and currently starts at second doubles, and has a lot of<br />\nmatch expereince. Missner notched a straight set victory. Unfortunately for Hopkins, he was<br />\nthe only Blue Jay player to win<br />\nhis singles match, which meant<br />\nthat Hopkins was eliminated<br />\nbefore any of the three doubles<br />\nmatches were completed. Ryu<br />\nIwai, the only senior on the team,<br />\nlost at #1 singles; freshman Bill<br />\nBraude lost at #2; junior Sam<br />\nKim lost at #3; freshman Mike<br />\nKim (no relation to Sam) lost at<br />\n#6.<br />\nAlthough tennis is considered<br />\na gentlemanly sport, by the end<br />\nof the match there was definitely<br />\nno love lost between Catholic and<br />\nHopkins. Catholic's #1 player,<br />\nGeorge Santana, angered some<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins team,<br />\nespecially assistant coach Tom<br />\nMcCarthy, when he openly and<br />\nverbally celebrated a double fault<br />\nby Iwai.<br />\nLater on, Iwai and Santana faced each other again in a doubles<br />\nmatch. Iwai and Braude were up<br />\n6-1, 5-2 when more trouble<br />\nstarted. With Iwai at the net,<br />\nBraude set to receive serve, the<br />\nCatholic player served the ball as<br />\nhard as he could directly at Iwai.<br />\nConsidering that he had fairly<br />\ngood control over his serve the<br />\nwhole day, it was obvious to most<br />\nwhat the intentions behind the<br />\n\"errant\" serve were.<br />\nMcCarthy was noticeably<br />\nangered at the action, and addressed it to Catholic's coach,<br /><br />\nwho did nothing. In fact, he appeared to make a direct threat or<br />\nchallenge to the Catholic player.<br />\n\"When he serves the ball 130<br />\nmiles per hour at my number one<br />\nplayer, of course I'm going to be<br />\nupset,\" McCarthy commented.<br />\nCooler heads prevailed, however,<br />\nand the Catholic team was able to<br />\nleave campus unscathed.<br />\nThe following day Hopkins<br />\ntook on Division I neighbor<br />\nLoyola, seeking to rebound from<br />\nthe 7-2 defeat. This time all of<br />\nHopkins' made the match. Engquist got pounded at #2 singles,<br />\n6-3, 6-0, although he had beaten<br />\nhis opponent last year 6-3, 6-4.<br />\nBraude suffered a similar fate at<br />\n#3, 6-0, 6-4, even though he had<br />\nalso beaten Loyola's #2 player<br />\nlast fall. However, Sam Kim<br />\ncame through with a long threeset win in the #4 slot, and Ted<br />\nRoth thoroughly dismantled his<br />\nopponent, 6-1, 6-3, in about ten<br />\nminutes at #5. Mike Kim fought<br />\nhis way to a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 win in<br />\na<br />\ntwo-and-one-half-hour<br />\nmarathon, giving Hopkins a slim<br />\n3-2 lead going into the doubles.<br />\nYou may be wondering what<br />\nhappened in the first singles<br />\nmatch.
