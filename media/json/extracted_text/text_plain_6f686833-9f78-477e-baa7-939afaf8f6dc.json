We think it is immediately evident that this<br />\ndocument badly needs revision and clarification. The question the<br />\nstudents should consider is how this revision should be carried out,<br />\nand how the duties of the president should be strengthened.<br />\nThe four main objects of the Council as stated in the present<br />\nCouncil constitution are as follows:<br />\n\"(a) To serve as intermediary between Administration, faculty, students, and undergraduate activities.<br />\n\"(b) To correlate the various University activities, promoting<br />\ncooperation of all parties in matters affecting the welfare of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n\"(c) To uphold and promote the Johns Hopkins Honor System.<br />\n\"(d) To speak for the student body in dealings with parties<br />\noutside of the University as provided in Article VI, Sections 4<br />\nand 5.\"<br />\nAccording to the present Council by-laws, the Student Council<br />\npresident shall:<br />\n\"1. Carry out in spirit and detail the provision of the Constitution and by-laws.<br />\n\"2. Preside at meetings of the Student Council.<br />\n\"3. Preside at student assemblies when necessary.<br />\n\"4. Keep in close touch with the faculty, students and student<br />\naffairs.<br />\n\"5. Organize the Freshman class.<br />\n\"6. Oversee the enforcement of the Freshman regulations,<br />\nif any have been passed.<br />\n\"7. Direct /arrangements for, and hold inter-class contests.<br />\n\"8. Supervise class election.<br />\n\"9. Co-operate with the authorities in the preservation of the<br />\nproper conduct of students and of the good appearance of the buildings, grounds, lunch-rooms, etc.<br />\nv10. Perform any additional duties which may arise consistent<br />\nwith the four main objects of the Student Council.\"<br />\nOf the four main purposes of the Council constitution listed<br />\nabove, (a) and (b) are blanket clauses in need of concrete definition. Parts of (a) and (b) and all of (c) are duties now fulfilled by<br />\nother campus groups. Articlg VI Section 4 of (d) refers to the<br />\nhonor Code. Section 5 of that Article is a further blanket clause<br />\nin need of definition. It reads:<br />\n\"The Student Council shall have the power to speak for the<br />\nstudent body in dealings with parties outside the University on<br />\nquestions of concern to the entire student body. If necessary, the<br />\nStudent Council shall refer questions that may be the outcome of<br />\nsuch dealings to the student body for decision by vote.\"<br />\nThis needs clarification. As it stands it tends to give the impression that the Council and the student body presume upon<br />\nthemselves the powers of the University administration.<br />\nOf the President's duties, one, four, nine and ten are blanket<br />\nclauses and semi to require interpretation and clarification by the<br />\nCouncil president himself six and seven are duties now performed<br />\nby other campus organizations. Two and three are simple chairing<br />\nduties. Five and eight thus are the only provisions that seem to<br />\nential any major duties, if \"major duties\" they can be called.<br />\nThe Council president's duty to organize politically the freshman<br />\nclass and supervise class elections is a heavy responsibility and we<br />\nare not trying to minimize the fact. But how strong and active is<br />\nthe Council today? Constitutionally, can the president do more<br />\nthan just run a series of popularity polls?<br />\nThe man who leads a revision of the constitution must be a<br />\nperson who has insight into the campus, who has the tact to help<br />\norganizations, and who has the imagination to see problems and<br />\ntheir solutions.<br />\nIf, by nature of some extraordinary miracle, the student body<br />\nin the April 20-21 election chooSes a president on more stable<br />\ngrounds than popularity appeal and/or social affiliation, we hope<br />\nhe will be mature enough, of a character strong enough, and objective enough to disregard friendship ties and personal feelings<br />\nin order to appoint the m\u2018st responsible and best qualified men<br />\non 'campus to his committees.<br />\nWe hope he will vigorously clarify, define, re-define and perhaps even spur the Council to recast its constitution.<br />\nFinally, we hope he will be the long awaited Council president:<br />\nthe Council president who will shake the Council out of its cumbersome dormancy and make it a meaningful organ of student<br />\nrepresentation and campus government.<br />\n<br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, April 9 1954<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nOne Score<br />\nAnd Five ...<br />\nThe News-Letters of April, '29<br />\ncontain the father of all \"Kinsey<br />\nreports\", a questionnaire put out<br />\nby the Hullabaloo.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo asked all students such things as:<br />\n\"Do you like blondes or brunettes?\"<br />\n\"Do you neck?\" \"On the first<br />\ndate?\"<br />\n\"Are you a gentleman?\"<br />\n\"Will you marry for love or<br />\nmoney?\"<br />\nTo the last question the NewsLetter said cynically: \"That, after<br />\nall, is a rather foolish question, for<br />\na college education has been in<br />\nvain if it has not taught that<br />\nmoney is more necessary than<br />\nlove.\"<br />\nCocky Writer<br />\nThis same cocky writer said of<br />\nthe query, \"What salary do you<br />\nexpect the first week at your vocation?\", answers to this should be<br />\ndelayed until about the middle of<br />\nnext July.

BURGAN<br />\n<br />\nPreceding Lectures<br />\nThe series opened with a talk<br />\nentitled, Change and Continuity.<br />\nTracing the growth of democracy<br />\nin Victorian England, Mr. Clark<br />\nhere emphasized the maintenance<br />\nof control, for the greater part of<br />\nthe century, in the hands of aristocrats. Despite labor agitation<br />\nand middle class unrest, he said,<br />\nand despite the reform bills these<br />\npressures produced, the old ruling<br />\nclass persisted in power, adapting<br />\nto current needs the techniques<br />\nof governing learned earlier under<br />\na totally non-democratic regime.<br />\nThe very slowness of change fostered the grafting of an old faith<br />\nin individual rights, protected by<br />\nlaw, onto a new faith in popular<br />\nsovereignty.<br />\nActing on society at the same<br />\ntime, however, was another force<br />\nof which the full importance was<br />\nonly slowly perceived. Its nature<br />\nis indicated in, the title of Mr.<br />\nClark's second lecture: Government by Expert. Its messiah, was<br />\nBentham, with his formula of \"inquiry, legislation, execution, inspection, and report.\" With the<br />\nsole exception of legislation, each<br />\nof these<br />\nactivities called for<br />\nknowledge and proficiency, but<br />\nnot, obviously, for vote-getting<br />\npopularity. Citing Edwin Chadwick as an epitome of the new<br />\ncreed, the speaker remarked that<br />\nthis great improver of public<br />\nhealth gained support not by public speaking, but by making known<br />\n<br />\nof such concentration of power Mr.<br />\nClark did not for a moment deny.<br />\nIndeed, he insisted upon it. For<br />\nhe regards it as implied in the<br />\nvery concept of democracy. What<br />\nhe did deny was that there is<br />\nanything in this political concept<br />\nto assure the protection of individual freedom in the flux of political exigencies.<br />\nMr. Clark drew several examples<br />\nfrom life in England today which<br />\nindicated both the existence of a<br />\nrule of law and the vast potentialities of the state for overriding<br />\nit. Ultimately, he said, the only<br />\nguarantee that there can be On the<br />\nmaintenance of individual rights is<br />\nan inner conviction (shared, presumably, by the experts) of the<br />\n\"eternal, innate value\" of any individual as such.<br />\nWhat Every Schoolboy Knows<br />\nSome members of the departing<br />\naudience observed, in the full flush<br />\nof an optimism I find difficult to<br />\nshare, that Mr. Clark had said<br />\nlittle that everybody doesn't already know.

Jerry<br />\n<br />\nFive Weightlifters<br />\nWin In Odd Lifts<br />\n<br />\nBy HOWARD WASKOW<br />\nAssistant Sports Editor<br />\nIn the campus excitement that<br />\nalways accompanies the coming<br />\nof a new sport season, intramural<br />\ncompetition is often overlooked in<br />\nfavor of varsity and, to a lesser<br />\nextent, Freshmen team activities.<br />\nThis year is an exception. Intramural softball and lacrosse are<br />\nthriving. Student interest is high,<br />\nand the games are well-played,<br />\nspirited affairs. However, at least<br />\nin the case of softball, there is<br />\none regrettable blemish in the otherwise bright picture\u2014the lack of<br />\ncompetent umpires, umpires who<br />\nknow the rules.<br />\nThe umpiring situation is pretty<br />\nsad. More times than not, arbiters<br />\n(that's the word the professional<br />\n<br />\nbases, and the ball touches an<br />\nobstruction or is blocked, the<br />\nrunner being played shall be entitled to advance one base beyond that at which the overthrow was made and all other<br />\nrunners shall be entitled to the<br />\nsamenumber of bases as the man<br />\non whom<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nplay was made.<br />\n<br />\nNumber of bases to be determined by the base occupied by<br />\neach runner at the time of the<br />\npitch preceding the overthrow.<br />\nNote:<br />\n<br />\nIf<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nball<br />\n<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\nnot<br />\n<br />\nblocked, or does not touch an<br />\nobstruction, the ball remains in<br />\nplay and runners may advance<br />\nat their own risk as far as they<br />\ncan make it.<br />\n<br />\nIn Rule 24, the. Official Rules<br />\nsportswriters use for umpires, so<br />\nwe may as well use it, too) are state:<br />\nAn overthrow is a ball thrown<br />\npicked up from an adjoining ball<br />\nfield and thrown into the breech.<br />\nWhether or not they know anything about softball means nothing; if they have a couple of free<br />\nhours, they're acceptable umpires<br />\n<br />\nfrom one fielder to another to<br />\nretire a runner who has not<br />\nreached or is off his base, and<br />\nwhich goes into foul territory<br />\non a play at first, third, or home<br />\n<br />\nand that's that.<br />\n<br />\nbase ...

On investigation, one finds<br />\nthat the Official Rules of Softball,<br />\napproved by the Joint Rules Committee on Softball, state in Rule<br />\n27, Section 8:<br />\nWhen, on any play which<br />\nstarts with a batted ball, the<br />\nball is overthrown into foul territory at first, third, or home<br />\n<br />\npitching deliveries. Common misconception in the fraternity<br />\nleagues has it illegal to deliver<br />\na ball in which the knuckles, instead of the palm of the hand,<br />\nface the batter. Rule 8, the \"Pitching Rule,\" says nothing whatever<br />\nabout the palm of the hand facing<br />\nthe batter.<br />\n<br />\nFive weight lifters won in their<br />\nrespective weight classes at the<br />\nOdd Lift meet held March 31 in<br />\nthe Gym.<br />\nOutstanding lifts were made by<br />\nAlexander Su Ping and Fred Palmieri.

We think it is immediately evident that this<br />\ndocument badly needs revision and clarification. The question the<br />\nstudents should consider is how this revision should be carried out,<br />\nand how the duties of the president should be strengthened.<br />\nThe four main objects of the Council as stated in the present<br />\nCouncil constitution are as follows:<br />\n\"(a) To serve as intermediary between Administration, faculty, students, and undergraduate activities.<br />\n\"(b) To correlate the various University activities, promoting<br />\ncooperation of all parties in matters affecting the welfare of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n\"(c) To uphold and promote the Johns Hopkins Honor System.<br />\n\"(d) To speak for the student body in dealings with parties<br />\noutside of the University as provided in Article VI, Sections 4<br />\nand 5.\"<br />\nAccording to the present Council by-laws, the Student Council<br />\npresident shall:<br />\n\"1. Carry out in spirit and detail the provision of the Constitution and by-laws.<br />\n\"2. Preside at meetings of the Student Council.<br />\n\"3. Preside at student assemblies when necessary.<br />\n\"4. Keep in close touch with the faculty, students and student<br />\naffairs.<br />\n\"5. Organize the Freshman class.<br />\n\"6. Oversee the enforcement of the Freshman regulations,<br />\nif any have been passed.<br />\n\"7. Direct /arrangements for, and hold inter-class contests.<br />\n\"8. Supervise class election.<br />\n\"9. Co-operate with the authorities in the preservation of the<br />\nproper conduct of students and of the good appearance of the buildings, grounds, lunch-rooms, etc.<br />\nv10. Perform any additional duties which may arise consistent<br />\nwith the four main objects of the Student Council.\"<br />\nOf the four main purposes of the Council constitution listed<br />\nabove, (a) and (b) are blanket clauses in need of concrete definition. Parts of (a) and (b) and all of (c) are duties now fulfilled by<br />\nother campus groups. Articlg VI Section 4 of (d) refers to the<br />\nhonor Code. Section 5 of that Article is a further blanket clause<br />\nin need of definition. It reads:<br />\n\"The Student Council shall have the power to speak for the<br />\nstudent body in dealings with parties outside the University on<br />\nquestions of concern to the entire student body. If necessary, the<br />\nStudent Council shall refer questions that may be the outcome of<br />\nsuch dealings to the student body for decision by vote.\"<br />\nThis needs clarification. As it stands it tends to give the impression that the Council and the student body presume upon<br />\nthemselves the powers of the University administration.<br />\nOf the President's duties, one, four, nine and ten are blanket<br />\nclauses and semi to require interpretation and clarification by the<br />\nCouncil president himself six and seven are duties now performed<br />\nby other campus organizations. Two and three are simple chairing<br />\nduties. Five and eight thus are the only provisions that seem to<br />\nential any major duties, if \"major duties\" they can be called.<br />\nThe Council president's duty to organize politically the freshman<br />\nclass and supervise class elections is a heavy responsibility and we<br />\nare not trying to minimize the fact. But how strong and active is<br />\nthe Council today? Constitutionally, can the president do more<br />\nthan just run a series of popularity polls?<br />\nThe man who leads a revision of the constitution must be a<br />\nperson who has insight into the campus, who has the tact to help<br />\norganizations, and who has the imagination to see problems and<br />\ntheir solutions.<br />\nIf, by nature of some extraordinary miracle, the student body<br />\nin the April 20-21 election chooSes a president on more stable<br />\ngrounds than popularity appeal and/or social affiliation, we hope<br />\nhe will be mature enough, of a character strong enough, and objective enough to disregard friendship ties and personal feelings<br />\nin order to appoint the m\u2018st responsible and best qualified men<br />\non 'campus to his committees.<br />\nWe hope he will vigorously clarify, define, re-define and perhaps even spur the Council to recast its constitution.<br />\nFinally, we hope he will be the long awaited Council president:<br />\nthe Council president who will shake the Council out of its cumbersome dormancy and make it a meaningful organ of student<br />\nrepresentation and campus government.<br /><br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, April 9 1954<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nOne Score<br />\nAnd Five ...<br />\nThe News-Letters of April, '29<br />\ncontain the father of all \"Kinsey<br />\nreports\", a questionnaire put out<br />\nby the Hullabaloo.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo asked all students such things as:<br />\n\"Do you like blondes or brunettes?\"<br />\n\"Do you neck?\" \"On the first<br />\ndate?\"<br />\n\"Are you a gentleman?\"<br />\n\"Will you marry for love or<br />\nmoney?\"<br />\nTo the last question the NewsLetter said cynically: \"That, after<br />\nall, is a rather foolish question, for<br />\na college education has been in<br />\nvain if it has not taught that<br />\nmoney is more necessary than<br />\nlove.\"<br />\nCocky Writer<br />\nThis same cocky writer said of<br />\nthe query, \"What salary do you<br />\nexpect the first week at your vocation?\", answers to this should be<br />\ndelayed until about the middle of<br />\nnext July.

For self as a<br />\nsingle organism, obedient<br />\nthe source of his greatest anxiety to the impulses of an official<br />\nis the tendency of citizens in his \"brain\"; the tendency of the<br />\ncountry and ours to assume that \"checks and balances\" to stop<br />\nguaranteed individual freedom is checking and balancing as the disomehow built into constitutional vided powers rearrange themselves<br />\ndemocracy; that, indeed, the ideal in an hierarchical order; and so<br />\nand the political structure are in- forth.<br />\nseparable.

BURGAN<br /><br />\nPreceding Lectures<br />\nThe series opened with a talk<br />\nentitled, Change and Continuity.<br />\nTracing the growth of democracy<br />\nin Victorian England, Mr. Clark<br />\nhere emphasized the maintenance<br />\nof control, for the greater part of<br />\nthe century, in the hands of aristocrats. Despite labor agitation<br />\nand middle class unrest, he said,<br />\nand despite the reform bills these<br />\npressures produced, the old ruling<br />\nclass persisted in power, adapting<br />\nto current needs the techniques<br />\nof governing learned earlier under<br />\na totally non-democratic regime.<br />\nThe very slowness of change fostered the grafting of an old faith<br />\nin individual rights, protected by<br />\nlaw, onto a new faith in popular<br />\nsovereignty.<br />\nActing on society at the same<br />\ntime, however, was another force<br />\nof which the full importance was<br />\nonly slowly perceived. Its nature<br />\nis indicated in, the title of Mr.<br />\nClark's second lecture: Government by Expert. Its messiah, was<br />\nBentham, with his formula of \"inquiry, legislation, execution, inspection, and report.\" With the<br />\nsole exception of legislation, each<br />\nof these<br />\nactivities called for<br />\nknowledge and proficiency, but<br />\nnot, obviously, for vote-getting<br />\npopularity. Citing Edwin Chadwick as an epitome of the new<br />\ncreed, the speaker remarked that<br />\nthis great improver of public<br />\nhealth gained support not by public speaking, but by making known<br /><br />\nof such concentration of power Mr.<br />\nClark did not for a moment deny.<br />\nIndeed, he insisted upon it. For<br />\nhe regards it as implied in the<br />\nvery concept of democracy. What<br />\nhe did deny was that there is<br />\nanything in this political concept<br />\nto assure the protection of individual freedom in the flux of political exigencies.<br />\nMr. Clark drew several examples<br />\nfrom life in England today which<br />\nindicated both the existence of a<br />\nrule of law and the vast potentialities of the state for overriding<br />\nit. Ultimately, he said, the only<br />\nguarantee that there can be On the<br />\nmaintenance of individual rights is<br />\nan inner conviction (shared, presumably, by the experts) of the<br />\n\"eternal, innate value\" of any individual as such.<br />\nWhat Every Schoolboy Knows<br />\nSome members of the departing<br />\naudience observed, in the full flush<br />\nof an optimism I find difficult to<br />\nshare, that Mr. Clark had said<br />\nlittle that everybody doesn't already know. Perhaps; but one<br />\nmay ask whether \"everybody\"<br />\ndoesn't know these things in the<br />\nsame way that every adolescent,<br />\nnot an idiot, is supposed to have<br />\nall the theorems of Euclid inside<br />\nhis head.

Intramural softball and lacrosse are<br />\nthriving. Student interest is high,<br />\nand the games are well-played,<br />\nspirited affairs. However, at least<br />\nin the case of softball, there is<br />\none regrettable blemish in the otherwise bright picture\u2014the lack of<br />\ncompetent umpires, umpires who<br />\nknow the rules.<br />\nThe umpiring situation is pretty<br />\nsad. More times than not, arbiters<br />\n(that's the word the professional<br /><br />\nbases, and the ball touches an<br />\nobstruction or is blocked, the<br />\nrunner being played shall be entitled to advance one base beyond that at which the overthrow was made and all other<br />\nrunners shall be entitled to the<br />\nsamenumber of bases as the man<br />\non whom<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nplay was made.<br /><br />\nNumber of bases to be determined by the base occupied by<br />\neach runner at the time of the<br />\npitch preceding the overthrow.<br />\nNote:<br /><br />\nIf<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nball<br /><br />\nis<br /><br />\nnot<br /><br />\nblocked, or does not touch an<br />\nobstruction, the ball remains in<br />\nplay and runners may advance<br />\nat their own risk as far as they<br />\ncan make it.<br /><br />\nIn Rule 24, the. Official Rules<br />\nsportswriters use for umpires, so<br />\nwe may as well use it, too) are state:<br />\nAn overthrow is a ball thrown<br />\npicked up from an adjoining ball<br />\nfield and thrown into the breech.<br />\nWhether or not they know anything about softball means nothing; if they have a couple of free<br />\nhours, they're acceptable umpires<br /><br />\nfrom one fielder to another to<br />\nretire a runner who has not<br />\nreached or is off his base, and<br />\nwhich goes into foul territory<br />\non a play at first, third, or home<br /><br />\nand that's that.<br /><br />\nbase ...

On investigation, one finds<br />\nthat the Official Rules of Softball,<br />\napproved by the Joint Rules Committee on Softball, state in Rule<br />\n27, Section 8:<br />\nWhen, on any play which<br />\nstarts with a batted ball, the<br />\nball is overthrown into foul territory at first, third, or home<br /><br />\npitching deliveries. Common misconception in the fraternity<br />\nleagues has it illegal to deliver<br />\na ball in which the knuckles, instead of the palm of the hand,<br />\nface the batter. Rule 8, the \"Pitching Rule,\" says nothing whatever<br />\nabout the palm of the hand facing<br />\nthe batter.<br /><br />\nFive weight lifters won in their<br />\nrespective weight classes at the<br />\nOdd Lift meet held March 31 in<br />\nthe Gym.<br />\nOutstanding lifts were made by<br />\nAlexander Su Ping and Fred Palmieri.
