Booker, an Alumus and graduate student<br />\nhere, and an afore-time Editor-in-chief of this paper.<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\nThe questions discussed in his letter are just-those which are at<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\npresent<br />\nunder the consideration of the Inter-Fraternity Conference,<br />\nV.<br />\nwhich is now holding regular meetings. This conference began as<br />\nV.<br />\nthe unofficial gathering together of some six or seven men. More<br />\nIIVVVVVVVVVI:<br />\nrecently two men have been chosen by each fraternity to represent<br />\n- a their chapters officially and to lay before the several fraternities in<br />\nchapter meeting the several articles in the agreement under consideration.<br />\nAs Mr. Booker strikes right at the root of the matter, as the plans of the conference are<br />\nin no way secret, and as such plans will be of interest to all students who are not as yet<br />\nacquainted with them, it may be well to state briefly the agreements at which the originators of the present conference aimed\u2014agreements to which it is but fair to say that three fraternities at least are not yet ready to consent.<br />\n\"ICIO *An. OW- UV<br />\n<br />\n(1)<br />\n(2)<br />\n(3)<br />\n(4)<br />\n<br />\nThat no man shall be invited to join a fraternity prior to a fixed, though as yet, uncertain date.<br />\nThat no fraternity shall entertain on the night of the Y. M. C. A. reception.<br />\nThat no upper-classman shall for fraternity reasons protect a freshman from hazing.<br />\nThat a general inter-fraternity meeting shall be arranged at least once a year.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no reason why propositions 2, 3, and 4 should not receive immediate and general acceptance. The rub lies in the first article of the agreement. In an ideal condition of<br />\naffairs such an arrangement, would of course, be in vogue now. But conditions are not Utopian here, and if we wish to approach anywhere near the suburbs of the city of our ideals we<br />\nmust be careful. \"Run slow through switches, curves and over crossings\"\u2014and the proposition to enact a date prior to which no man can be pledged is a most decided switch from the<br />\npresent fraternity track.<br />\nIn one point in particular we believe everyone will agree that Mr. Booker is wrong.<br />\nHe says, \"Set a date, say toward the end of the Freshman year, upon which all the fraternities<br />\nindividually offer election to the men they have selected.\" At a large college, with Freshman<br />\nClubs, and distinctly drawn class lines, such a suggestion is feasible and practicable. Here it<br />\nis almost certainly not.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n,futtur<br />\nluitanip<br />\nA AI<br />\n<br />\nACROSSE and Track are of course the two great athletic interests of<br />\nthe spring here at Hopkins.

Of course, a good many lacrosse men and, we suppose,<br />\nall the track men would find time to enter.

In the meantime, if a tennis tournament can be arranged\u2014and we trust that it<br />\ncan\u2014matches could be played at the Baltimore Country Club, by those who are members<br />\nthere; at Catonsville; or, if necessary, at Druid Hill Park.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nINT3\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTF,MPORA! 0 Mores!

Would you deprive us of the pleasure to which we look forward<br />\nduring the last ten minutes of every hour, would you take from us the sparkling wit, the<br />\nguileful pun, the satirical tongue, the mimic's jest and the freshman's wond'ring gaze? Come<br />\nand listen to the keen wits of the matriculates, developed as is possible under no circumstances<br />\nas well as under Walter's eye, and hasten to tear down with your own puissant hands the bull<br />\nwhich takes from the duller brain, the chance to glean a sharper wit, and more brilliant mind.<br />\nV V<br />\ns_. 1010.1010 V V.

All signs which point homeward are welcome!<br />\nBut the stand will not be ready until the fall, and in the meanwhile<br />\nwe have before us what promises to be the greatest lacrosse season<br />\never experienced in Baltimore. There are not enough benches at<br />\nthe field. They are temporary, to be sure, but were several more<br />\nplaced there this spring, certainly some use could be found for all the<br />\nbenches somewhere after the permament stand has been built.<br />\n<br />\nAN OPEN LETTER ON THE FRATERNITY QUESTION.<br />\n. of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nTo the Editor<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014I am glad to see the movement for an understanding between the fraternities in regard to 'pledging.\" It should rid them of the greatest hindrance to their healthy<br />\ngrowth here\u2014the too early pledging.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LrIVER.<br />\n<br />\nThat this evil is as universal as it is detrimental, is evidenced by a letter recently published in The Nezt;s,in which a prep-school teacher complains of the harm done his pupils' work<br />\nby the incessant fraternity campaigning.<br />\nThis is only one side of the medallion. Constant campaigning keeps the brother so<br />\nbusy developing his chapter, that there is no time left for him to be developed by his fraternity. He literally exists for the fraternity. This is the reverse of what was meant to be.<br />\nThe fraternity should exist for him. It is not like relations or like large families. It<br />\nis not sent from heaven. It was created by the \"student\" to fill a student's needs. The<br />\nmoment it ceases to do this, that moment it has ceased to be a functional part of the student's<br />\nlife,\u2014and it has lost its right to exist.<br />\nBut, so far, the situation is in the hands of the fraternity men. Any future condition<br />\nthat does away with fraternities here will arise from their present inability to regulate their<br />\nrelations.<br />\nFor that regulation is possible, I have not the least doubt. Of course, the men .delegated to shape it must have an average amount of self-colltrol and imagination, and every<br />\none of them must be capable of the conviction that any attempt to make an arrangement<br />\nspecially favorable to his crowd\u2014which, from its very nature, could be only a temporary one<br />\n\u2014would jeopardize a permanent improvement in the condition of all alike. Given men up to<br />\nthese requirements, any plan, as first adopted, would probably be all wrong. Like railroad<br />\nlegislation, it must have time to grow. It may never he quite perfected\u2014no laws anywhere<br />\nare ever up-to-date\u2014but give it a chance, and it will not only improve the conditions of chapter life, it will also insure the continuance of fraternities in good odor and forestall a feeling<br />\nagainst them on the part of parents and teachers which has already begun to manifest itself.<br />\nIn approaching such an attempt, three things at once occur to me as of paramount<br />\nimportance; first, provide sufficient time for the school boy to realize conditions here; Second,<br />\nprevent the tender of an election until a day set by all; third, prevent the acceptance of an<br />\nelection until some day following.<br />\nFirst, of course, a committee of delegates from each fraternity, ultimately to become a<br />\npermanent court. Let it set a date, say toward the end of the Freshman year\u2014upon which<br />\nall the fraternities individually offer election to the men they have selected; let it set a date<br />\nclosely following this upon which every freshman who has received a notice of election meets<br />\nthe delegates in a body and declares openly his acceptance of election into this or that fraternity,\u2014at the same time, taking oath that he has neither been offered an election, nor has he<br />\naccepted one until the dates agreed upon by all. Whereupon, the delegate representing the<br />\nfraternity whose invitation he has accepted, then steps forward on the part of the fraternity<br />\nand takes an oath to the same effect. And let no candidate be initiated until he has announced his acceptance of election through the delegates assembled in a body.<br />\nSuch an oath would prevent any fraternity from secretly violating the treaty. Of<br />\ncourse, open violation would mean a rupture of relations. Whether or not, a fraternity would<br />\nwant to go back upon its agreement, is a matter of reasonable doubt. Whether or not it<br />\ncould afford to do so, is a matter of reasonable certainty. This agreement, or a similar one<br />\nwould carry with it benefits which would be both immediate and far-reaching. It would first<br />\nof all do away with the indignified scramble known as \"robbing the cradle\" and the consequent indignation of parents and teachers such as we have recently had evidence of.<br />\nIt would prevent the bad feeling resulting from \"tampering with pledged men,\"\u2014<br />\nwhich never finds expression, and is more intense than if it did.<br />\nIt would put the fraternities in a dignified position toward the incoming men, and<br />\nenable them to exercise a disciplinary effect corresponding to that at Princeton, and at other<br />\nplaces where the honor is held before the freshman, at the formative time of his college life.<br />\nIt would give everybody time to realize what he was about, which would in turn pre\"mistakes.\"<br />\nAs a result, the student-body would settle into place easily and naturally<br />\nvent<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n=7\"<br />\n<br />\nand, most to be desired, unself-consciously. Everybody would be where he belonged, and,<br />\nbetter still, nobody would be where he did not belong.<br />\nBut above all, it would mitigate the evil of the time-devouring campaign, which has<br />\nalways stunted the growth of real fraternity life here,\u2014protests to the contrary, notwithstanding. This is an unnatural state of affairs, the outgrowth of the abnormal position of a college<br />\nin a big city. And it can be bettered only by a treaty fair to all, and squarely lived up to.<br />\nJOHN M. BOOKER, 1901.<br />\n<br />\nTHE 'CONFERENCE.\"<br />\nBoth our Editorial and Mr. Booker's letter in this issue of the NEWS-LETTER have lost<br />\nmost of their point since the final decision of the Inter-Fraternity Conference that no definite<br />\nagreement in the matter of pledges should be entered upon. Notwithstanding the fact that<br />\nseveral fraternities felt that it would be wise to have an inter-fraternity agreement minus the<br />\npledging clause, nothing was done regarding the remaining articles of the agreement and the<br />\nconference adjourned, apparently sine die.<br />\n<br />\nJOINT CONCERT.<br />\nThe Joint Concert by the Woman's College<br />\nand Hopkins proved to be a great success.<br />\nEveryone who attended was very much<br />\npleased with the entire performance. Many<br />\npronounced it the best concert that they had<br />\nheard for several years. Every number on<br />\nthe program was enjoyable and well rendered.<br />\nThe features which were most popular with<br />\nthe audience were the solos, all of which were<br />\nexceptionally go od ; the medley by the<br />\nWoman's College Glee Club; and the \"Song<br />\nof the Vikings,\" which was sung by the two<br />\nGlee Clubs\u2014a chorus of about fifty voices.<br />\nThis was, indeed, a splendid number. It was<br />\na beautiful sight to see the girls in their caps<br />\nand gowns, each wearing a bouquet of flowers,<br />\nand the men in evening dress with a spray of<br />\nlillies of the valley in their lapels.<br />\nThe decorations of the hall added to the<br />\nfestivity of the occasion. The stage was<br />\nbanked with palms, above which were hung<br />\nin the center the Woman's College flag and<br />\nthe Hopkins flag. Around the sides of the<br />\nhall were tastefully draped the class banners<br />\nof the two colleges. Very pretty programs<br />\nwere made for the concert. They contained<br />\nthe picture of each club, a list of the<br />\nmembers of the clubs, and also the<br />\npatronesses.<br />\nEverything went off without a hitch and<br />\nconsequently the concert did not drag in a<br />\n<br />\nsingle place. Although they began at halfpast eight, and although there were no waits<br />\nbetween numbers, the concert was not over<br />\nuntil eleven o'clock. A proof that the concert was not boring was that everyone sat<br />\nthrough to the end.<br />\nAside from the concert being such a success<br />\nin a musical and social way, it was just as<br />\nmuch so from the financial side. While the<br />\nmanager is unwilling to state the exact<br />\namount of profit that each club made, he says<br />\nhe is perfectly satisfied with the results, and<br />\nthat now the clubs will be able to take an<br />\nEaster trip for three days down the Eastern<br />\nShore. Heretofore the clubs have been<br />\ngreatly hampered by lack of funds and for<br />\nthis reason they have not been able to take<br />\nany extended trips, as it is impossible to do<br />\nso without having any capital. After taking<br />\nthe Easter trip, the management hopes to have<br />\nmore than enough to pay off the debt incurred<br />\nthree years ago. During that year the clubs<br />\nwere very fine and they took several long trips,<br />\nand the season was considered to be very successful and prosperotth, but it is not generally<br />\nknow that the manager left the clubs with a<br />\ndebt of over two hundred dollars. This debt<br />\nhas, however, been reduced by Manager T.<br />\nPoole Maynard to about one-half. The management hopes to be able to wipe out this<br />\ndebt, and to let the clubs start next year unencumbered by any debts.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n1=11<br />\n<br />\nOUR YELLS.<br />\nThe matter of yells and yelling and yellleader is one of considerable importance right<br />\nnow.

Several men dropped out along here.<br />\nThe course across field to Falls road was a<br />\ndifficult one, for several of the hills were so<br />\nsteep that running up them was a practical<br />\nimpossibility. Then, too, the course was not<br />\nproperly-placarded, and several men lost their<br />\nway.<br />\nHowever, the majority kept well<br />\nbunched, and even in the run over the<br />\nCounty Club's links and up the Falls road, it<br />\nwas the long grind up Cold Spring lane that<br />\ntried the mettle.

Princeton and other colleges of<br />\nathletic reputation have found it worth while<br />\nto have this practice in the last part of the<br />\nyear, and it seems that Hopkins will have peculiarly favorable conditions for taking this<br />\nmatter up during this spring. There will be<br />\nno recognized baseball team, and the field will<br />\nbe open for football, except during lacrosse<br />\npractice. As lacrosse is the main form of<br />\nathletics for which Hopkins is known, it<br />\nseems that football practice should be undertaken only - when the two will not conflict.<br />\nThe lacrosse men, however, might make arrangements for practicing at different hours;<br />\nor, if this should not prove feasible, could<br />\nsurely use the cage several days in the week.<br />\nHopkins has plenty of material for a good<br />\nfootball team next year, and work right at<br />\nthis time will surely count. Neither the lacrosse nor football men, however, ought to<br />\nexpect to monopolize the field every afternoon<br />\nin the week. We suggest that the managers<br />\nof the teams concerned make some arrangements for giving up the field to each other certain days in the week, the men to go to Homewood or practice in the cage, according to<br />\nsome definite agreement.<br />\nThe University Played good football this<br />\nyear, and greater spirit was shown in supporting the team than ever before.

Booker, an Alumus and graduate student<br />\nhere, and an afore-time Editor-in-chief of this paper.<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\nThe questions discussed in his letter are just-those which are at<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\npresent<br />\nunder the consideration of the Inter-Fraternity Conference,<br />\nV.<br />\nwhich is now holding regular meetings. This conference began as<br />\nV.<br />\nthe unofficial gathering together of some six or seven men. More<br />\nIIVVVVVVVVVI:<br />\nrecently two men have been chosen by each fraternity to represent<br />\n- a their chapters officially and to lay before the several fraternities in<br />\nchapter meeting the several articles in the agreement under consideration.<br />\nAs Mr. Booker strikes right at the root of the matter, as the plans of the conference are<br />\nin no way secret, and as such plans will be of interest to all students who are not as yet<br />\nacquainted with them, it may be well to state briefly the agreements at which the originators of the present conference aimed\u2014agreements to which it is but fair to say that three fraternities at least are not yet ready to consent.<br />\n\"ICIO *An. OW- UV<br /><br />\n(1)<br />\n(2)<br />\n(3)<br />\n(4)<br /><br />\nThat no man shall be invited to join a fraternity prior to a fixed, though as yet, uncertain date.<br />\nThat no fraternity shall entertain on the night of the Y. M. C. A. reception.<br />\nThat no upper-classman shall for fraternity reasons protect a freshman from hazing.<br />\nThat a general inter-fraternity meeting shall be arranged at least once a year.<br /><br />\nThere is no reason why propositions 2, 3, and 4 should not receive immediate and general acceptance. The rub lies in the first article of the agreement. In an ideal condition of<br />\naffairs such an arrangement, would of course, be in vogue now. But conditions are not Utopian here, and if we wish to approach anywhere near the suburbs of the city of our ideals we<br />\nmust be careful. \"Run slow through switches, curves and over crossings\"\u2014and the proposition to enact a date prior to which no man can be pledged is a most decided switch from the<br />\npresent fraternity track.<br />\nIn one point in particular we believe everyone will agree that Mr. Booker is wrong.<br />\nHe says, \"Set a date, say toward the end of the Freshman year, upon which all the fraternities<br />\nindividually offer election to the men they have selected.\" At a large college, with Freshman<br />\nClubs, and distinctly drawn class lines, such a suggestion is feasible and practicable. Here it<br />\nis almost certainly not.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n,futtur<br />\nluitanip<br />\nA AI<br /><br />\nACROSSE and Track are of course the two great athletic interests of<br />\nthe spring here at Hopkins. But there must be a good many men<br />\n.

Of course, a good many lacrosse men and, we suppose,<br />\nall the track men would find time to enter. This year the courts at<br />\ngigirgE2.1111*<br />\nHomewood will not be laid out, but it is to be hoped that it will not<br />\nn<br />\n61:1&amp;no,\u2022<br />\nbe long before Hopkins will have several courts there. In the meantime, if a tennis tournament can be arranged\u2014and we trust that it<br />\ncan\u2014matches could be played at the Baltimore Country Club, by those who are members<br />\nthere; at Catonsville; or, if necessary, at Druid Hill Park.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nINT3\u2022<br /><br />\nTF,MPORA! 0 Mores!

Here were discussed the leading Scottish poets of the<br />\nRenaissance, the elements of Philosophy, the latest play of the day, and even character study<br />\namong the faculty. Trustees! Would you deprive us of the pleasure to which we look forward<br />\nduring the last ten minutes of every hour, would you take from us the sparkling wit, the<br />\nguileful pun, the satirical tongue, the mimic's jest and the freshman's wond'ring gaze? Come<br />\nand listen to the keen wits of the matriculates, developed as is possible under no circumstances<br />\nas well as under Walter's eye, and hasten to tear down with your own puissant hands the bull<br />\nwhich takes from the duller brain, the chance to glean a sharper wit, and more brilliant mind.<br />\nV V<br />\ns_. 1010.1010 V V. V lif 1.V V<br /><br />\nHE announcement that the Trustees have appropriated money for the<br />\nerection of a grand stand at Homewood is being received by everyone with pleasure. All signs which point homeward are welcome!<br />\nBut the stand will not be ready until the fall, and in the meanwhile<br />\nwe have before us what promises to be the greatest lacrosse season<br />\never experienced in Baltimore. There are not enough benches at<br />\nthe field. They are temporary, to be sure, but were several more<br />\nplaced there this spring, certainly some use could be found for all the<br />\nbenches somewhere after the permament stand has been built.<br /><br />\nAN OPEN LETTER ON THE FRATERNITY QUESTION.<br />\n. of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nTo the Editor<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014I am glad to see the movement for an understanding between the fraternities in regard to 'pledging.\" It should rid them of the greatest hindrance to their healthy<br />\ngrowth here\u2014the too early pledging.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LrIVER.<br /><br />\nThat this evil is as universal as it is detrimental, is evidenced by a letter recently published in The Nezt;s,in which a prep-school teacher complains of the harm done his pupils' work<br />\nby the incessant fraternity campaigning.<br />\nThis is only one side of the medallion. Constant campaigning keeps the brother so<br />\nbusy developing his chapter, that there is no time left for him to be developed by his fraternity. He literally exists for the fraternity. This is the reverse of what was meant to be.<br />\nThe fraternity should exist for him. It is not like relations or like large families. It<br />\nis not sent from heaven. It was created by the \"student\" to fill a student's needs. The<br />\nmoment it ceases to do this, that moment it has ceased to be a functional part of the student's<br />\nlife,\u2014and it has lost its right to exist.<br />\nBut, so far, the situation is in the hands of the fraternity men. Any future condition<br />\nthat does away with fraternities here will arise from their present inability to regulate their<br />\nrelations.<br />\nFor that regulation is possible, I have not the least doubt. Of course, the men .delegated to shape it must have an average amount of self-colltrol and imagination, and every<br />\none of them must be capable of the conviction that any attempt to make an arrangement<br />\nspecially favorable to his crowd\u2014which, from its very nature, could be only a temporary one<br />\n\u2014would jeopardize a permanent improvement in the condition of all alike. Given men up to<br />\nthese requirements, any plan, as first adopted, would probably be all wrong. Like railroad<br />\nlegislation, it must have time to grow. It may never he quite perfected\u2014no laws anywhere<br />\nare ever up-to-date\u2014but give it a chance, and it will not only improve the conditions of chapter life, it will also insure the continuance of fraternities in good odor and forestall a feeling<br />\nagainst them on the part of parents and teachers which has already begun to manifest itself.<br />\nIn approaching such an attempt, three things at once occur to me as of paramount<br />\nimportance; first, provide sufficient time for the school boy to realize conditions here; Second,<br />\nprevent the tender of an election until a day set by all; third, prevent the acceptance of an<br />\nelection until some day following.<br />\nFirst, of course, a committee of delegates from each fraternity, ultimately to become a<br />\npermanent court. Let it set a date, say toward the end of the Freshman year\u2014upon which<br />\nall the fraternities individually offer election to the men they have selected; let it set a date<br />\nclosely following this upon which every freshman who has received a notice of election meets<br />\nthe delegates in a body and declares openly his acceptance of election into this or that fraternity,\u2014at the same time, taking oath that he has neither been offered an election, nor has he<br />\naccepted one until the dates agreed upon by all. Whereupon, the delegate representing the<br />\nfraternity whose invitation he has accepted, then steps forward on the part of the fraternity<br />\nand takes an oath to the same effect. And let no candidate be initiated until he has announced his acceptance of election through the delegates assembled in a body.<br />\nSuch an oath would prevent any fraternity from secretly violating the treaty. Of<br />\ncourse, open violation would mean a rupture of relations. Whether or not, a fraternity would<br />\nwant to go back upon its agreement, is a matter of reasonable doubt. Whether or not it<br />\ncould afford to do so, is a matter of reasonable certainty. This agreement, or a similar one<br />\nwould carry with it benefits which would be both immediate and far-reaching. It would first<br />\nof all do away with the indignified scramble known as \"robbing the cradle\" and the consequent indignation of parents and teachers such as we have recently had evidence of.<br />\nIt would prevent the bad feeling resulting from \"tampering with pledged men,\"\u2014<br />\nwhich never finds expression, and is more intense than if it did.<br />\nIt would put the fraternities in a dignified position toward the incoming men, and<br />\nenable them to exercise a disciplinary effect corresponding to that at Princeton, and at other<br />\nplaces where the honor is held before the freshman, at the formative time of his college life.<br />\nIt would give everybody time to realize what he was about, which would in turn pre\"mistakes.\"<br />\nAs a result, the student-body would settle into place easily and naturally<br />\nvent<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n=7\"<br /><br />\nand, most to be desired, unself-consciously. Everybody would be where he belonged, and,<br />\nbetter still, nobody would be where he did not belong.<br />\nBut above all, it would mitigate the evil of the time-devouring campaign, which has<br />\nalways stunted the growth of real fraternity life here,\u2014protests to the contrary, notwithstanding. This is an unnatural state of affairs, the outgrowth of the abnormal position of a college<br />\nin a big city. And it can be bettered only by a treaty fair to all, and squarely lived up to.<br />\nJOHN M. BOOKER, 1901.<br /><br />\nTHE 'CONFERENCE.\"<br />\nBoth our Editorial and Mr. Booker's letter in this issue of the NEWS-LETTER have lost<br />\nmost of their point since the final decision of the Inter-Fraternity Conference that no definite<br />\nagreement in the matter of pledges should be entered upon. Notwithstanding the fact that<br />\nseveral fraternities felt that it would be wise to have an inter-fraternity agreement minus the<br />\npledging clause, nothing was done regarding the remaining articles of the agreement and the<br />\nconference adjourned, apparently sine die.<br /><br />\nJOINT CONCERT.<br />\nThe Joint Concert by the Woman's College<br />\nand Hopkins proved to be a great success.<br />\nEveryone who attended was very much<br />\npleased with the entire performance. Many<br />\npronounced it the best concert that they had<br />\nheard for several years. Every number on<br />\nthe program was enjoyable and well rendered.<br />\nThe features which were most popular with<br />\nthe audience were the solos, all of which were<br />\nexceptionally go od ; the medley by the<br />\nWoman's College Glee Club; and the \"Song<br />\nof the Vikings,\" which was sung by the two<br />\nGlee Clubs\u2014a chorus of about fifty voices.<br />\nThis was, indeed, a splendid number. It was<br />\na beautiful sight to see the girls in their caps<br />\nand gowns, each wearing a bouquet of flowers,<br />\nand the men in evening dress with a spray of<br />\nlillies of the valley in their lapels.<br />\nThe decorations of the hall added to the<br />\nfestivity of the occasion. The stage was<br />\nbanked with palms, above which were hung<br />\nin the center the Woman's College flag and<br />\nthe Hopkins flag. Around the sides of the<br />\nhall were tastefully draped the class banners<br />\nof the two colleges. Very pretty programs<br />\nwere made for the concert. They contained<br />\nthe picture of each club, a list of the<br />\nmembers of the clubs, and also the<br />\npatronesses.<br />\nEverything went off without a hitch and<br />\nconsequently the concert did not drag in a<br /><br />\nsingle place. Although they began at halfpast eight, and although there were no waits<br />\nbetween numbers, the concert was not over<br />\nuntil eleven o'clock. A proof that the concert was not boring was that everyone sat<br />\nthrough to the end.<br />\nAside from the concert being such a success<br />\nin a musical and social way, it was just as<br />\nmuch so from the financial side. While the<br />\nmanager is unwilling to state the exact<br />\namount of profit that each club made, he says<br />\nhe is perfectly satisfied with the results, and<br />\nthat now the clubs will be able to take an<br />\nEaster trip for three days down the Eastern<br />\nShore. Heretofore the clubs have been<br />\ngreatly hampered by lack of funds and for<br />\nthis reason they have not been able to take<br />\nany extended trips, as it is impossible to do<br />\nso without having any capital. After taking<br />\nthe Easter trip, the management hopes to have<br />\nmore than enough to pay off the debt incurred<br />\nthree years ago. During that year the clubs<br />\nwere very fine and they took several long trips,<br />\nand the season was considered to be very successful and prosperotth, but it is not generally<br />\nknow that the manager left the clubs with a<br />\ndebt of over two hundred dollars. This debt<br />\nhas, however, been reduced by Manager T.<br />\nPoole Maynard to about one-half. The management hopes to be able to wipe out this<br />\ndebt, and to let the clubs start next year unencumbered by any debts.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n1=11<br /><br />\nOUR YELLS.<br />\nThe matter of yells and yelling and yellleader is one of considerable importance right<br />\nnow.

Then, too, the course was not<br />\nproperly-placarded, and several men lost their<br />\nway.<br />\nHowever, the majority kept well<br />\nbunched, and even in the run over the<br />\nCounty Club's links and up the Falls road, it<br />\nwas the long grind up Cold Spring lane that<br />\ntried the mettle.

Princeton and other colleges of<br />\nathletic reputation have found it worth while<br />\nto have this practice in the last part of the<br />\nyear, and it seems that Hopkins will have peculiarly favorable conditions for taking this<br />\nmatter up during this spring. There will be<br />\nno recognized baseball team, and the field will<br />\nbe open for football, except during lacrosse<br />\npractice. As lacrosse is the main form of<br />\nathletics for which Hopkins is known, it<br />\nseems that football practice should be undertaken only - when the two will not conflict.<br />\nThe lacrosse men, however, might make arrangements for practicing at different hours;<br />\nor, if this should not prove feasible, could<br />\nsurely use the cage several days in the week.<br />\nHopkins has plenty of material for a good<br />\nfootball team next year, and work right at<br />\nthis time will surely count. Neither the lacrosse nor football men, however, ought to<br />\nexpect to monopolize the field every afternoon<br />\nin the week.
