Investigation found that the college man was \"high hatting\" his<br />\nfellow workers. The reasons for this were: the scoffing attitude of the untrained laborers toward the \"Collidge Boy\"; and<br />\nthe failure of the college man to \"fraternize\" with the great<br />\nunwashed.<br />\nArthur C. Jewett, in charge of the investigation, lays much<br />\nof the blatn..t on the university graduate. \"Sometimes if there<br />\nwere less effort spent in making it known that the beginner is<br />\na college graduate,\" he says,\"and more in trying to conceal the<br />\nfact until it proves a practical advantage, as it eventually will,<br />\nthere would be fewer disappointments.\"<br />\nOften, it was pointed out, the college man starts at a disadvantage. Instead of realizing this and striving to learn from<br />\nthe older but less highly trained workers, he too often overrates his theoretical work. The result is a cleavage between the<br />\nexperienced and the educated workers with a consequent loss of<br />\nefficiency.<br />\nCollege men must realize that the classroom is but the<br />\nprelude. The main work comes later.

For this unexpected assistance we are grateful. In<br />\nfact, if this good samaritanism continues, we might ever remark<br />\nthat it will solve the many problems of this column for once and<br />\nfor all.<br />\nIt is possible, of course, that ye editors found much that was<br />\ninexperienced and without promise. For instance, we entirely<br />\nneglected our preliminary bow to our editorial colleagues, in<br />\ngeneral, and to their bosses in particular. We fear that it is now<br />\ntoo late for that pleasant gesture. We also fear that we are not<br />\nexactly in the mood for it.

GOODNOW'S<br />\nNEW PLAN IS OFFERED BY \"COMUS\"<br />\nBy Comus<br />\n<br />\nCertain members of the student body have been asked, \"What<br />\ndo you think of the New Plan?\" Eli Siegel came out to interview<br />\nMagill, and spent many minutes of metaphysical time persuading<br />\nMac that studies are more interesting than football. (Mac remained<br />\nskeptical). The expressed opinion of the students was about divided<br />\nsome approving and others condemning. One senior said, \"I believe<br />\nthere should be, in this country, an institution of the type suggested,<br />\nbut I hate to see Hopkins drop its extra-curricular charms.\" The<br />\nundergraduate who devotes the usual one-half of one per cent, of<br />\nhis time to meditation, believes that Dr. Goodnow's idea is excellent.<br />\nBut this same undergrad is attached to the Blue Jay, or football, or<br />\nlacrosse, or it may even be a social frat, and he looks forward to the<br />\ntime when a younger brother will throw new energy into the upbuilding of this favorite sideline. So now, when the New Plan<br />\nlooms more definitely near at hand, it also looms more threateningly. Many who favored the plan are now backing down, avoiding it. Why? The answer we undergraduates give is the spirit<br />\nof the place will be changed. The spirit of the place!<br />\nWhen the spirit of the place is threatened, it wakes up, in<br />\nevery man, a realization of the significance of its meaning. Those<br />\nhuge Western Universities are morbid, or crude\u2014raw in many<br />\ndifferent ugly manners of rawness. Hopkins is riper, cleaner,<br />\nmore substantial. It is sufficiently small to permit intimacy. We<br />\nhave grown attached to it. And we do not want these places<br />\noverrun with bespectacled, nauseating transfers .from the crude<br />\nbig Universities. We would be exclusive. We would save this<br />\nspirit for our younger friends.<br />\nThis is part of the answer to the rude question, \"What do you<br />\nthink of the New Plan?\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Man, Well Dressed\u2014<br />\ncarries about him an air of complete harmony<br />\n<br />\n\u2014the clothes finesse that comes only when<br />\nevery accessory is correct.

Investigation found that the college man was \"high hatting\" his<br />\nfellow workers. The reasons for this were: the scoffing attitude of the untrained laborers toward the \"Collidge Boy\"; and<br />\nthe failure of the college man to \"fraternize\" with the great<br />\nunwashed.<br />\nArthur C. Jewett, in charge of the investigation, lays much<br />\nof the blatn..t on the university graduate. \"Sometimes if there<br />\nwere less effort spent in making it known that the beginner is<br />\na college graduate,\" he says,\"and more in trying to conceal the<br />\nfact until it proves a practical advantage, as it eventually will,<br />\nthere would be fewer disappointments.\"<br />\nOften, it was pointed out, the college man starts at a disadvantage. Instead of realizing this and striving to learn from<br />\nthe older but less highly trained workers, he too often overrates his theoretical work. The result is a cleavage between the<br />\nexperienced and the educated workers with a consequent loss of<br />\nefficiency.<br />\nCollege men must realize that the classroom is but the<br />\nprelude. The main work comes later.

For this unexpected assistance we are grateful. In<br />\nfact, if this good samaritanism continues, we might ever remark<br />\nthat it will solve the many problems of this column for once and<br />\nfor all.<br />\nIt is possible, of course, that ye editors found much that was<br />\ninexperienced and without promise. For instance, we entirely<br />\nneglected our preliminary bow to our editorial colleagues, in<br />\ngeneral, and to their bosses in particular. We fear that it is now<br />\ntoo late for that pleasant gesture. We also fear that we are not<br />\nexactly in the mood for it.

GOODNOW'S<br />\nNEW PLAN IS OFFERED BY \"COMUS\"<br />\nBy Comus<br /><br />\nCertain members of the student body have been asked, \"What<br />\ndo you think of the New Plan?\" Eli Siegel came out to interview<br />\nMagill, and spent many minutes of metaphysical time persuading<br />\nMac that studies are more interesting than football. (Mac remained<br />\nskeptical). The expressed opinion of the students was about divided<br />\nsome approving and others condemning. One senior said, \"I believe<br />\nthere should be, in this country, an institution of the type suggested,<br />\nbut I hate to see Hopkins drop its extra-curricular charms.\" The<br />\nundergraduate who devotes the usual one-half of one per cent, of<br />\nhis time to meditation, believes that Dr. Goodnow's idea is excellent.<br />\nBut this same undergrad is attached to the Blue Jay, or football, or<br />\nlacrosse, or it may even be a social frat, and he looks forward to the<br />\ntime when a younger brother will throw new energy into the upbuilding of this favorite sideline. So now, when the New Plan<br />\nlooms more definitely near at hand, it also looms more threateningly. Many who favored the plan are now backing down, avoiding it. Why? The answer we undergraduates give is the spirit<br />\nof the place will be changed. The spirit of the place!<br />\nWhen the spirit of the place is threatened, it wakes up, in<br />\nevery man, a realization of the significance of its meaning. Those<br />\nhuge Western Universities are morbid, or crude\u2014raw in many<br />\ndifferent ugly manners of rawness. Hopkins is riper, cleaner,<br />\nmore substantial. It is sufficiently small to permit intimacy. We<br />\nhave grown attached to it.
