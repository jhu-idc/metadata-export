L. SOMERVILLE<br />\n<br />\nReflections On Rushing<br />\nWith rushing season well under way, we are tempted to<br />\nreiterate our recent prophecy that the fraternity system is<br />\nsecure on the Hopkins campus only so long as it is prepared<br />\nto adjust itself to the changes that may be taking place in its<br />\nfreshman audience.<br />\nThese changes, we admit, may not be as severe as many of<br />\n-Us predicted in the early days of the New Plan, but the generally<br />\ndisappointing turn-outs for last Saturday's stag parties is a<br />\nstraw in the wind that can not be ignored even by the most<br />\nindifferent rushing chairman.<br />\nWe do not mean to imply that a definite swing away from<br />\nfraternities is developing in the freshman class as a result of some<br />\nobscure New Plan influence. We are suggesting, however, that<br />\nthis translation of an ideal into efficient terms, this new system<br />\nwith which we are still acquainting ourselves\u2014this New Plan,<br />\nmay be attracting a new type of personality to Homewood.<br />\nIf, during the next few weeks, the fraternities find that they<br />\nare meeting fewer party boys and more violinists, they must<br />\nadjust to this change. The fraternities have no choice but to<br />\nbend with the prevailing wind.<br />\nTo the interested freshman we offer a word of cautious advice.<br />\nFraternities occupy a secondary prace in the Hopkins tradition<br />\nand this is as it should be. This is not a \"greek campus\"; the<br />\nemphasis is upon moderation. The decision that many of you<br />\nwill make on November 9 is, therefore, not as crucial as first<br />\nimpressions may lead you to believe.<br />\nThe necessary motives for \"going fraternity\" are abundantly<br />\npresent, as they were in previous years. The freshman is typically a young man away from home in a challenging and some-what indifferent environment. He needs security and the fraternity offers it on the group level. His standards, still influenced<br />\nby mental pictures of the ideal \"college-man\", dictate that the<br />\nnon-fraternity man is a social misfit.<br />\nThe unique feature of the Hopkins fraternity community<br />\nis that it is a minority group. We doubt the proposition that this<br />\nis due to a high degree of selectivity on the part of the fraternities. The more likely assumption is that a great many Hopkins<br />\nstudents derive security from other sources or are unwilling to pay<br />\nthe price, in terms of cash ond conviction, of fraternity membership. The independent is not mis-fitted, but finds himself in a large<br />\nand diversified group. We make these observations out of<br />\n\u2022 fairness to the system and the freshman because during the<br />\nensuing weeks the advantage of propaganda will definitely lie<br />\nwith the fraternities. These are considerations that must not<br />\nbe overlooked by the prospective brother.<br />\nWe recognize the psychological necessity for the 'fraternity<br />\nsystem, but are unable to reconcile its discriminatory clauses and<br />\nessentially undemocratic processes with the traditionally liberal<br />\natmosphere of \u2022the Hopkins. The very fact that fraternities are<br />\na large and increasingly vital factor on the American college scene<br />\nis unmistakable evidence that there are those who disagree with<br />\nthe above considerations or who tacitly choose to ignore them.<br />\nIf you should choose to make the decision, by all means, make<br />\nit critically and only after all doubts have been dispelled and<br />\nall questions answered. The choice between a number of possible<br />\nfraternities is indeed a crucial one. Each of the thirteen social<br />\nfra4ernities at Hopkins is in some measure characteristically<br />\ndifferent from its competitors. Each _represents a unique collective<br />\npersonality and it is to this personality that the freshman<br />\nmust relate himself, even conform, if he is to belong.<br />\n<br />\n31011ns iqtykins Neurs-Erttrr<br />\nFounded in 1897<br />\nPublished every Friday during regular sessions of The Johns Hopkins University except during examinations and college holiday periods, by under.<br />\ngraduates of the University.<br />\n<br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nAl N Epstein<br />\nElmore Wallin<br />\n<br />\nintroduction to the General's<br />\nbroadcasted address), and forgot<br />\nmomentarily the little blue speck<br />\non the platform off in the lighted<br />\ndistance who was their cheerleader, taking it upon themselves to<br />\nInterpret mistakenly another blue<br />\nspeck as the grinning aspirant<br />\nhimself.

L. SOMERVILLE<br /><br />\nReflections On Rushing<br />\nWith rushing season well under way, we are tempted to<br />\nreiterate our recent prophecy that the fraternity system is<br />\nsecure on the Hopkins campus only so long as it is prepared<br />\nto adjust itself to the changes that may be taking place in its<br />\nfreshman audience.<br />\nThese changes, we admit, may not be as severe as many of<br />\n-Us predicted in the early days of the New Plan, but the generally<br />\ndisappointing turn-outs for last Saturday's stag parties is a<br />\nstraw in the wind that can not be ignored even by the most<br />\nindifferent rushing chairman.<br />\nWe do not mean to imply that a definite swing away from<br />\nfraternities is developing in the freshman class as a result of some<br />\nobscure New Plan influence. We are suggesting, however, that<br />\nthis translation of an ideal into efficient terms, this new system<br />\nwith which we are still acquainting ourselves\u2014this New Plan,<br />\nmay be attracting a new type of personality to Homewood.<br />\nIf, during the next few weeks, the fraternities find that they<br />\nare meeting fewer party boys and more violinists, they must<br />\nadjust to this change. The fraternities have no choice but to<br />\nbend with the prevailing wind.<br />\nTo the interested freshman we offer a word of cautious advice.<br />\nFraternities occupy a secondary prace in the Hopkins tradition<br />\nand this is as it should be. This is not a \"greek campus\"; the<br />\nemphasis is upon moderation. The decision that many of you<br />\nwill make on November 9 is, therefore, not as crucial as first<br />\nimpressions may lead you to believe.<br />\nThe necessary motives for \"going fraternity\" are abundantly<br />\npresent, as they were in previous years. The freshman is typically a young man away from home in a challenging and some-what indifferent environment. He needs security and the fraternity offers it on the group level. His standards, still influenced<br />\nby mental pictures of the ideal \"college-man\", dictate that the<br />\nnon-fraternity man is a social misfit.<br />\nThe unique feature of the Hopkins fraternity community<br />\nis that it is a minority group. We doubt the proposition that this<br />\nis due to a high degree of selectivity on the part of the fraternities. The more likely assumption is that a great many Hopkins<br />\nstudents derive security from other sources or are unwilling to pay<br />\nthe price, in terms of cash ond conviction, of fraternity membership. The independent is not mis-fitted, but finds himself in a large<br />\nand diversified group. We make these observations out of<br />\n\u2022 fairness to the system and the freshman because during the<br />\nensuing weeks the advantage of propaganda will definitely lie<br />\nwith the fraternities. These are considerations that must not<br />\nbe overlooked by the prospective brother.<br />\nWe recognize the psychological necessity for the 'fraternity<br />\nsystem, but are unable to reconcile its discriminatory clauses and<br />\nessentially undemocratic processes with the traditionally liberal<br />\natmosphere of \u2022the Hopkins. The very fact that fraternities are<br />\na large and increasingly vital factor on the American college scene<br />\nis unmistakable evidence that there are those who disagree with<br />\nthe above considerations or who tacitly choose to ignore them.<br />\nIf you should choose to make the decision, by all means, make<br />\nit critically and only after all doubts have been dispelled and<br />\nall questions answered. The choice between a number of possible<br />\nfraternities is indeed a crucial one. Each of the thirteen social<br />\nfra4ernities at Hopkins is in some measure characteristically<br />\ndifferent from its competitors. Each _represents a unique collective<br />\npersonality and it is to this personality that the freshman<br />\nmust relate himself, even conform, if he is to belong.<br /><br />\n31011ns iqtykins Neurs-Erttrr<br />\nFounded in 1897<br />\nPublished every Friday during regular sessions of The Johns Hopkins University except during examinations and college holiday periods, by under.<br />\ngraduates of the University.<br /><br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nAl N Epstein<br />\nElmore Wallin<br /><br />\nintroduction to the General's<br />\nbroadcasted address), and forgot<br />\nmomentarily the little blue speck<br />\non the platform off in the lighted<br />\ndistance who was their cheerleader, taking it upon themselves to<br />\nInterpret mistakenly another blue<br />\nspeck as the grinning aspirant<br />\nhimself.

Of course it is<br />\nquite possible that the predominately non-Irish audience which<br />\nlistened respectfully to the General was nonetheless irritated, and<br />\nincreasingly so, by the presence<br />\non the same platform of large Governor McKeldin and the giant shillelah he wielded so menacingly.<br />\nLocal Politicians<br />\nOne rather telling comment on<br />\nthe Republican crowd was this<br />\nstatement by a concerned pro-Ike<br />\nman: \"There wasn't a man in the<br />\nArmory without a coat and tie<br />\n...\" And another exclamation in<br />\nthe same context was: \"But one<br />\ngood-sized block in Highlandtown<br /><br />\nent and indelicate on both sides<br />\nof the party barrier.
