The privilege of attending a university extends further than merely going to classes and listening to lectures;<br />\nit means also the use of the facilities provided by the university. A<br />\nlarge percentage of college students attend small and inadeqtiately<br />\nequipped institutions, not endowed with a gymnasium, a stadium, a<br />\nstudent activities building, a library, and others. Hopkins has not<br />\nbeen fortunate in having endowments and large donations given her<br />\nand consequently has been deprived of many buildings actually<br />\nneeded. However, Hopkins has a fully equipped library recognized<br />\nas one of the most complete in the South. Our library is so well<br />\nknown that scholars come from great distances to peruse rare books<br />\nin the possession of our university. Some of our undergraduates<br />\nrealize what a tremendous fund of information, literature, and art is<br />\nstored within its walls. Others never make use of the library but<br />\nstarve to death in the midst of abundance. These students overlook<br />\nthe fact that we have a library with shelves upon shelves of books\u2014<br />\nbooks that contain the facts and fancies of three thousand years of<br />\ncivilization\u2014all free.<br />\nTo be a college student with the rest, to have the use of the campus and buildings, such as the library, devoted to students is unquestionably pleasant in many ways, but the sense of proprietorship<br />\nwhich so much liberty is likely to bring with it, the tendency to discourtesy and lack of consideration, is just as decidedly unpleasant.<br />\nA visitor at Hopkins only a short while ago asked someone on the<br />\nNews-Letter why \"SILENCE\" signs are placed in the library.<br />\n\"These requests for quiet seem to be completely ignored,\" he said,<br />\n\"and I notice many of your students use your library as a 'social center' to talk over campus gossip.\" It is unfortunate that the condition is obvious even to a visitor.<br />\n<br />\nThe team that will represent the<br />\nUnited States in the Olympic<br />\nGames polo competition has been<br />\nannounced as including Thomas<br />\nHitchcock, Jr., who will captain the<br />\nRodman<br />\nhorsemen;<br />\nAmerican<br />\n\\Vanamaker 2nd, Elmer J.

CHARLES ST.<br />\n<br />\nENGINEER LECTURES ON<br />\nCABLE PROBLEMS<br />\nThe design and construction of<br />\nthe newest types of electric cables<br />\nwas explained to an audience of<br />\nengineering juniors and seniors<br />\nlast Monday by William A. Del<br />\nMar, chief engineer of the Habirshaw Electric Cable Company,<br />\nYonkers, N. Y. The address given<br />\nin the auditorium of the M. E.<br />\nBuilding, was the third of a series<br />\nof lectures on \"Engineering Practice.\"<br />\nThe highest tension today of<br />\nthe single wire type carries 45,000<br />\nvolts, he said. Of three conductors, the highest potential is approximately 27,000 volts. These<br />\nfigures were presented by Mr. Del<br />\nMar to show the need of the utmost care and skill in the manufacture of cables.<br />\nThree possible methods of making cables were presented by the<br />\nspeaker. The simplest method,<br />\nhe explained, is to insert a single<br />\nconductor in a cylinder, with only<br />\nthe air between them serving as<br />\nan insulating medium. However,<br />\nhe declared, the best material to<br />\ndo away with surface leakage is<br />\nordinary oil. This, he said, has the<br />\ndisadvantage of extreme fluidity,<br />\nwhich is overcome by using some<br />\nvariety of grease, preferably petroleum grease.<br />\nDetailed construction of the<br />\npresent day high tension electric<br />\ncable was clearly shown by means<br />\nof photographs of the machines in<br />\nuse in the Habirshaw Electric Cable Company.<br />\nAlthough the construction of an<br />\nelectric cable may seem rather<br />\nsimple to the layman, Mr. Del<br />\nMar declared that every branch<br />\nof science must be used in order<br />\nto handle the problem.<br />\n<br />\nYou won't fumble this cap!<br />\nProfessional jugglers could handle the oldstyle shaving cream caps and never once drop<br />\none down the drain or under the bath tub.<br />\nBut for most of us,this new Williams HingeCap puts an end to an ancient nuisance.<br />\nWilliams Shaving Cream is just as much<br />\npleasanter to use as is the Hinge-Cap. It<br />\nsoftens the beard with uncanny speed. The<br />\nthicker lather holds the moisture in against<br />\nthe skin where it is needed. This lather lubricates the skin, too, so that painful razor<br />\nfriction is eliminated. And when your shave<br />\nis done, that famous ingredient in Williams<br />\nwhich helps the skin, leaves your face cool,<br />\nsoothed and refreshed. No coloring matter<br />\nis used in Williams \u2014 it is a pure, naturalwhite shaving cream.<br />\n<br />\nCOMPANIES COMPETE FOR<br />\nMARKSMANSHIP PRIZE<br />\nInter-company competition in the<br />\nR. 0.

The privilege of attending a university extends further than merely going to classes and listening to lectures;<br />\nit means also the use of the facilities provided by the university. A<br />\nlarge percentage of college students attend small and inadeqtiately<br />\nequipped institutions, not endowed with a gymnasium, a stadium, a<br />\nstudent activities building, a library, and others. Hopkins has not<br />\nbeen fortunate in having endowments and large donations given her<br />\nand consequently has been deprived of many buildings actually<br />\nneeded. However, Hopkins has a fully equipped library recognized<br />\nas one of the most complete in the South. Our library is so well<br />\nknown that scholars come from great distances to peruse rare books<br />\nin the possession of our university. Some of our undergraduates<br />\nrealize what a tremendous fund of information, literature, and art is<br />\nstored within its walls. Others never make use of the library but<br />\nstarve to death in the midst of abundance. These students overlook<br />\nthe fact that we have a library with shelves upon shelves of books\u2014<br />\nbooks that contain the facts and fancies of three thousand years of<br />\ncivilization\u2014all free.<br />\nTo be a college student with the rest, to have the use of the campus and buildings, such as the library, devoted to students is unquestionably pleasant in many ways, but the sense of proprietorship<br />\nwhich so much liberty is likely to bring with it, the tendency to discourtesy and lack of consideration, is just as decidedly unpleasant.<br />\nA visitor at Hopkins only a short while ago asked someone on the<br />\nNews-Letter why \"SILENCE\" signs are placed in the library.<br />\n\"These requests for quiet seem to be completely ignored,\" he said,<br />\n\"and I notice many of your students use your library as a 'social center' to talk over campus gossip.\" It is unfortunate that the condition is obvious even to a visitor.<br /><br />\nThe team that will represent the<br />\nUnited States in the Olympic<br />\nGames polo competition has been<br />\nannounced as including Thomas<br />\nHitchcock, Jr., who will captain the<br />\nRodman<br />\nhorsemen;<br />\nAmerican<br />\n\\Vanamaker 2nd, Elmer J.

CHARLES ST.<br /><br />\nENGINEER LECTURES ON<br />\nCABLE PROBLEMS<br />\nThe design and construction of<br />\nthe newest types of electric cables<br />\nwas explained to an audience of<br />\nengineering juniors and seniors<br />\nlast Monday by William A. Del<br />\nMar, chief engineer of the Habirshaw Electric Cable Company,<br />\nYonkers, N. Y. The address given<br />\nin the auditorium of the M. E.<br />\nBuilding, was the third of a series<br />\nof lectures on \"Engineering Practice.\"<br />\nThe highest tension today of<br />\nthe single wire type carries 45,000<br />\nvolts, he said. Of three conductors, the highest potential is approximately 27,000 volts. These<br />\nfigures were presented by Mr. Del<br />\nMar to show the need of the utmost care and skill in the manufacture of cables.<br />\nThree possible methods of making cables were presented by the<br />\nspeaker. The simplest method,<br />\nhe explained, is to insert a single<br />\nconductor in a cylinder, with only<br />\nthe air between them serving as<br />\nan insulating medium. However,<br />\nhe declared, the best material to<br />\ndo away with surface leakage is<br />\nordinary oil. This, he said, has the<br />\ndisadvantage of extreme fluidity,<br />\nwhich is overcome by using some<br />\nvariety of grease, preferably petroleum grease.<br />\nDetailed construction of the<br />\npresent day high tension electric<br />\ncable was clearly shown by means<br />\nof photographs of the machines in<br />\nuse in the Habirshaw Electric Cable Company.<br />\nAlthough the construction of an<br />\nelectric cable may seem rather<br />\nsimple to the layman, Mr. Del<br />\nMar declared that every branch<br />\nof science must be used in order<br />\nto handle the problem.<br /><br />\nYou won't fumble this cap!<br />\nProfessional jugglers could handle the oldstyle shaving cream caps and never once drop<br />\none down the drain or under the bath tub.<br />\nBut for most of us,this new Williams HingeCap puts an end to an ancient nuisance.<br />\nWilliams Shaving Cream is just as much<br />\npleasanter to use as is the Hinge-Cap. It<br />\nsoftens the beard with uncanny speed. The<br />\nthicker lather holds the moisture in against<br />\nthe skin where it is needed. This lather lubricates the skin, too, so that painful razor<br />\nfriction is eliminated. And when your shave<br />\nis done, that famous ingredient in Williams<br />\nwhich helps the skin, leaves your face cool,<br />\nsoothed and refreshed. No coloring matter<br />\nis used in Williams \u2014 it is a pure, naturalwhite shaving cream.<br /><br />\nCOMPANIES COMPETE FOR<br />\nMARKSMANSHIP PRIZE<br />\nInter-company competition in the<br />\nR. 0.
