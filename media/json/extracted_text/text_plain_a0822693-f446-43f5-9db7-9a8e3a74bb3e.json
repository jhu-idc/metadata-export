Md.<br />\n<br />\nDO THEY REALLY WANT BASKETBALL?<br />\nIf the number of candidates for basketball is indicative of anything, the team should get off to a good start. Of course, the fact<br />\nthat some fifty men are hopeful of making the team does hot<br />\nnecessarily mean that there will be even five excellent basketball<br />\nplayers among the lot, but it does mean, we believe, that the<br />\nstudent body wants basketball.<br />\nNow, whether the team will receive the \"moral\" support of<br />\nthe student body at the games is a problem that is probably keeping some of our alumni awake at nights. Will the games be<br />\nwell attended? Would the sport prosper, though, if the team<br />\nshould lose its first two or three games? The opinion has been<br />\nexpressed on the campus that the success of the team, as far as<br />\nthe support of the student body is concerned, depends upon its<br />\nwinning the first few games. If it appears as though the team<br />\nwill be a good one, it is argued, the fickle student body will<br />\nsupport it; if not, there will be little or no interest evinced in it.<br />\nWe want to .warn against this point of view before it gains<br />\nheadway. Of course, we like to be optimistic, but it can hardly<br />\nbe expected that a team organized for the first time, and, moreover,<br />\ncomparatively late in the season, will win the State championship.<br />\nIf it wins more than half of its games, it will be doing exceedingly well. We hope, therefore, that the apparent enthusiasm for<br />\nthe new sport is not caused merely by the novelty. Though there<br />\nare no goal posts to tear down, there are still ways of supporting<br />\na team.<br />\n<br />\nA Nice New Car<br />\n<br />\nMoods.<br />\nWe all have them\u2014dark, gray,<br />\nsullen, sour, light, merry, funereal.<br />\nThey come and go unheralded and<br />\nin no particular order. They are<br />\nmiscellaneous.<br />\nSo with the Hopkins campus.<br />\nLike humans, its moods are manifold, and Gilman Hall, not yet old<br />\nenough to wear the unruffled dignity<br />\nof venerable aristocracy, readily reflects the changes in temperament.<br />\nOn windy days in autumn the<br />\ncampus takes on a frolicsome air<br />\nIt radiates mischief. Leaves, crisp<br />\nand sere, scurry pell mell in high<br />\nglee before the wind. Whole battalions of them race about like mad<br />\nin ecstatic confusion. Pieces of<br />\npaper and other movab!es, lying<br />\nabout, abrubtly come to life and<br />\ndance about in frisky fashion. Little whirlwinds and eddies of air<br />\nsuddenly spring up and go gamboling off into nothingness. And the<br />\nchimes in Gilman tower ring with<br />\na merrier note as roguish blasts play<br />\noutlandish pranks with fall styles<br />\nin co-ed apparel.<br />\nSometimes the spirit of the campus is dull\u2014duller than dirt, full of<br />\ndusty answers. Such is its complexion on a steaming day in midsummer, when inactivity charges<br />\nthe very atmosphere with stolid oppression. The face on the clock<br />\nlooks bored and somehow at a loss.<br />\nOften the change in mood on<br />\nsuch days is sudden. A thunderstorm gathers in the west and begins to descend like a scourge, whipping things into action as it comes.<br />\nThe air suddenly bristles with energy, becomes electric. The tower<br />\nlooks frightened, standing sharp out<br />\nin startling relief against the menacing gun metal hue of the clouds.<br />\nInertia gives place to taut expectancy, as a distant rumbling rolls<br />\na warning. The storm breaks and<br />\nHomewood quivers under the lash<br />\nof rain and lightning. Thus quickly<br />\nin life may dullness change to action.<br />\nOftentimes, on cold rainy days,<br />\nthe lead of the skies sinks its heavy<br />\npall, and gloom sits brooding on<br />\nthe chimney tops of Gilman Hall.<br />\nSlow, drizzling rain falls in mournful silence and black depression<br />\nreigns in sad state, like a corpse in<br />\nevening dress.<br />\nSuch conventional moods at<br />\n<br />\nHomewood are well known and frequent. It remains for a sleet storm,<br />\nsuch as the recent phenomenon, to<br />\nmake the campus temporarily a<br />\nregion of rare fantastic loveliness.<br />\nAll day last Sunday rain and<br />\nsleet had fallen and accumulated<br />\nin freezing, so that by evening<br />\nHomewood shone with an eerie and<br />\namazing beauty. The warm light<br />\nwithin the clock tower of Gilman<br />\nHall partially illuminated the flashing ice-glazed front of the building and shed a soft reflection out<br />\non the smooth, glassy surface of the<br />\nquadrangle.<br />\nThe campus became a wonderland of crystal, in which every object, however small, received its individual coating of ice. Railings,<br />\ndoor-knobs, the iron grating of the<br />\ngates of Gilman tunnel, the posts,<br />\nthe steps\u2014all shared in the general<br />\ntransformation.<br />\nSmooth sheets of silver marked<br />\nthe location of the tennis courts,<br />\nand the wire fences enclosing them<br />\nwere networks of crystal.<br />\nThe hedges, gleaming under the<br />\nboardwalk lamps, turned countless<br />\nleaves of clearest glass to the light.<br />\nThe tangle of honeysuckle vines on<br />\nthe slopes by the quadrangle showed<br />\nmyriad clusters of spun glass. The<br />\nboardwalk itself sparkled as if<br />\nstrewn with diamond dust, and the<br />\nwhole 'atmosphere flashed with the<br />\nfalling sleet, each particle a separate<br />\nsparkle.<br />\nPerhaps the most striking scene<br />\nof all was that from the top of the<br />\nbowl looking down upon Charles<br />\nstreet\u2014a poem in silver and gold.<br />\nEvery tree, down to its slenderest<br />\ntwig, was completely encased in<br />\nshining sleet.

Inc., 8th floor. Candler Building, Baltimore. Md.<br /><br />\nDO THEY REALLY WANT BASKETBALL?<br />\nIf the number of candidates for basketball is indicative of anything, the team should get off to a good start. Of course, the fact<br />\nthat some fifty men are hopeful of making the team does hot<br />\nnecessarily mean that there will be even five excellent basketball<br />\nplayers among the lot, but it does mean, we believe, that the<br />\nstudent body wants basketball.<br />\nNow, whether the team will receive the \"moral\" support of<br />\nthe student body at the games is a problem that is probably keeping some of our alumni awake at nights. Will the games be<br />\nwell attended? Would the sport prosper, though, if the team<br />\nshould lose its first two or three games? The opinion has been<br />\nexpressed on the campus that the success of the team, as far as<br />\nthe support of the student body is concerned, depends upon its<br />\nwinning the first few games. If it appears as though the team<br />\nwill be a good one, it is argued, the fickle student body will<br />\nsupport it; if not, there will be little or no interest evinced in it.<br />\nWe want to .warn against this point of view before it gains<br />\nheadway. Of course, we like to be optimistic, but it can hardly<br />\nbe expected that a team organized for the first time, and, moreover,<br />\ncomparatively late in the season, will win the State championship.<br />\nIf it wins more than half of its games, it will be doing exceedingly well. We hope, therefore, that the apparent enthusiasm for<br />\nthe new sport is not caused merely by the novelty. Though there<br />\nare no goal posts to tear down, there are still ways of supporting<br />\na team.<br /><br />\nA Nice New Car<br /><br />\nMoods.<br />\nWe all have them\u2014dark, gray,<br />\nsullen, sour, light, merry, funereal.<br />\nThey come and go unheralded and<br />\nin no particular order. They are<br />\nmiscellaneous.<br />\nSo with the Hopkins campus.<br />\nLike humans, its moods are manifold, and Gilman Hall, not yet old<br />\nenough to wear the unruffled dignity<br />\nof venerable aristocracy, readily reflects the changes in temperament.<br />\nOn windy days in autumn the<br />\ncampus takes on a frolicsome air<br />\nIt radiates mischief. Leaves, crisp<br />\nand sere, scurry pell mell in high<br />\nglee before the wind. Whole battalions of them race about like mad<br />\nin ecstatic confusion. Pieces of<br />\npaper and other movab!es, lying<br />\nabout, abrubtly come to life and<br />\ndance about in frisky fashion. Little whirlwinds and eddies of air<br />\nsuddenly spring up and go gamboling off into nothingness. And the<br />\nchimes in Gilman tower ring with<br />\na merrier note as roguish blasts play<br />\noutlandish pranks with fall styles<br />\nin co-ed apparel.<br />\nSometimes the spirit of the campus is dull\u2014duller than dirt, full of<br />\ndusty answers. Such is its complexion on a steaming day in midsummer, when inactivity charges<br />\nthe very atmosphere with stolid oppression. The face on the clock<br />\nlooks bored and somehow at a loss.<br />\nOften the change in mood on<br />\nsuch days is sudden. A thunderstorm gathers in the west and begins to descend like a scourge, whipping things into action as it comes.<br />\nThe air suddenly bristles with energy, becomes electric. The tower<br />\nlooks frightened, standing sharp out<br />\nin startling relief against the menacing gun metal hue of the clouds.<br />\nInertia gives place to taut expectancy, as a distant rumbling rolls<br />\na warning. The storm breaks and<br />\nHomewood quivers under the lash<br />\nof rain and lightning. Thus quickly<br />\nin life may dullness change to action.<br />\nOftentimes, on cold rainy days,<br />\nthe lead of the skies sinks its heavy<br />\npall, and gloom sits brooding on<br />\nthe chimney tops of Gilman Hall.<br />\nSlow, drizzling rain falls in mournful silence and black depression<br />\nreigns in sad state, like a corpse in<br />\nevening dress.<br />\nSuch conventional moods at<br /><br />\nHomewood are well known and frequent. It remains for a sleet storm,<br />\nsuch as the recent phenomenon, to<br />\nmake the campus temporarily a<br />\nregion of rare fantastic loveliness.<br />\nAll day last Sunday rain and<br />\nsleet had fallen and accumulated<br />\nin freezing, so that by evening<br />\nHomewood shone with an eerie and<br />\namazing beauty. The warm light<br />\nwithin the clock tower of Gilman<br />\nHall partially illuminated the flashing ice-glazed front of the building and shed a soft reflection out<br />\non the smooth, glassy surface of the<br />\nquadrangle.<br />\nThe campus became a wonderland of crystal, in which every object, however small, received its individual coating of ice.

The<br />\nboardwalk itself sparkled as if<br />\nstrewn with diamond dust, and the<br />\nwhole 'atmosphere flashed with the<br />\nfalling sleet, each particle a separate<br />\nsparkle.<br />\nPerhaps the most striking scene<br />\nof all was that from the top of the<br />\nbowl looking down upon Charles<br />\nstreet\u2014a poem in silver and gold.<br />\nEvery tree, down to its slenderest<br />\ntwig, was completely encased in<br />\nshining sleet.

A wealth of material is expected to be uncovered in an old<br />\nalmanac which one of the candidates has contributed in order to<br />\nfurnish original ideas for the December issue of Hopkins' wellknown comic. This almanac, which<br />\nhas been in the possession of the<br />\ncandidate's family for about a hundred years, is a small pocket-sized<br />\npaper-back publication of the type<br /><br />\nso familiar to our forefathers.<br />\nNaturally, it is highly prized because of its age and peculiar interest as one of the few surviving examples of a largely extinct type of<br />\nliterary effort. The lender has requested that it be carefully preserved.<br />\nIn addition to the almanac idea,<br />\nthe forthcoming Jay will contain<br />\nthe usual jokes, clever cuts and an<br />\neditorial by Donald White, editorin-chief.

There<br />\nis neither coal nor oil. The rivers<br />\ncontain water only during the rainy<br />\nseason. The only profitable undertakings are agriculture and the<br />\nleather industry.

They covered his voyage from New York and his travels<br />\nthrough Panama, Costa Rica and<br />\nJamaica, in addition to some small<br />\nislands which he visited.
