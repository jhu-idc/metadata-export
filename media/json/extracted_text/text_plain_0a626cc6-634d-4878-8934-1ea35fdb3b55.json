Nor did Dean Suskind,<br />\nto whose office it entrusted a<br />\nhost of piddling responsibilities<br />\nbetter suited to a Liverpool<br />\ntruant officer than to the<br />\nUniversity's second highest<br />\nacademic administrator.<br />\nWhat's more, the thing wasn't<br />\nlegally viable. University lawyers<br />\nadvised that Hopkins could well<br />\nbe entrenched in litigation until<br />\nits Tricentennial if that proposal<br />\never got through. And to be sure,<br />\nthe Dean's Office had had<br />\nenough legal hassles with the<br />\nsupposedly air-tight Honor<br />\nSystem. So, not wanting the ghost<br />\nof Blackstone himself to descend<br />\non Homewood House, Suskind<br />\ntold the committee to go back to<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nThe Student Council told the<br />\ncommittee to go out and get<br />\nsome proof Faculty weren't too<br />\nhappy about having a venerable<br />\nold institution done away with<br />\nby some self-appointed student<br />\ninquisitors on the basis of a vague<br />\nand unsubstantiated \"feeling\"<br />\nthat cheating had reached<br />\ndangerous proportions. And get<br />\nproof they did.<br />\nPoll<br />\nThe committee, on its two<br />\nweek research furlough,<br />\nconducted an anonymous poll of<br />\nstudents in large science survey<br />\ncourses, which asked the<br />\nstudents, among other questions,<br />\nif they had ever cheated on an<br />\nexam at Hopkins. The results<br />\nwere staggering. A terribly high,<br />\nembarrassingly high percentage<br />\nadmitted to having cheated. The<br />\nBaltimore Sun picked up on it.<br />\nThe News American picked up<br />\non it. Faculty members spoke in<br />\nhushed tones of the demise of<br />\nthe Honor System.<br />\nOne member of the Physics<br />\nfaculty reportedly suggested that<br />\nall the students who had<br />\nconfessed to cheating be<br />\napprehended and penalized<br />\nappropriately. It was pointed out<br />\nthat the survey was anoymous,<br />\nand that no matter how<br />\nsophisticated the techniques of<br />\ndetection, the handwriting on the<br />\nballots would surely not admit of<br />\nany conclusive deducation<br />\nconcerning individuality.<br />\nOne member of the committee<br />\ntheorized that perhaps the<br />\nstudents who had admitted to<br />\ncheating were not really guilty.<br />\nWas not confession akin to<br />\nabsolution, he inquired. Were<br />\nthey really guilty?<br />\nYeah, they were guilty; guilty<br />\nas hell. So the Student Council<br />\n<br />\nhad proof on its hands\u2014along<br />\nwith 2, alarmed faculty<br />\nmembers who were demanding<br />\nthat the governance for academic<br />\noffenses be revised with alacrity.<br />\nSo the Student Council sent out<br />\na new committee, comprised of<br />\nmost of the members of the old<br />\ncommittee and some interested<br />\nand respected professors, to find<br />\na viable alternative to the Honor<br />\nSystem. The rhetoric of the new<br />\ncommittee abounded with such<br />\nterms as viability, feasibility,<br />\nlegality, effectuality, and<br />\nintegrity.<br />\nThis was to be an efficient<br />\ncommittee which would produce<br />\nan acceptable alternative, and<br />\nwith due haste. For the end of<br />\nschool was waxing near, and the<br />\nwhole matter would have to be<br />\nput to student referendum before<br />\nsummer recess. So the new<br />\ncommittee burnt the midnight oil<br />\nto come up with an alternative<br />\nbefore the end of the semester.<br />\nAnd they did it. And it went to<br />\nstudent referendum. And the<br />\nstudents passed it. And all was<br />\n\"as it was before...\"<br />\nExcept that it just wouldn't<br />\ndo. The proposal was too ragged,<br />\ntoo vague in regard to legal<br />\ntechnicalities; in general, too<br />\nhastily compiled. It would have<br />\nto be rewritten. So the Student<br />\nCouncil and the Academic<br />\nCouncil, which was by now<br />\nimmersed in the turmoil, sent out<br />\na \"task force\" to rewrite the<br />\ndocument.<br />\nSo eight good students and<br />\nprofessors did spend their<br />\nsummer and early fall working on<br />\nthe alternative, perhaps<br />\nwondering occasionally whence<br />\nthe need for this effort had<br />\nsprang.<br />\nBut now that they're done, the<br />\ndocument will have to go back to<br />\nstudent referendum, because it's<br />\na different document than the<br />\none the students passed last<br />\nspring.<br />\nAnd it's precisely here that a<br />\nharrowing possibility arises.<br />\nSuppose the students don't pass<br />\nit. Suppose out of ignorance,<br />\ndisinterest, or sheer funk, they<br />\nvote it down. Then those six<br />\nmonths of work. which began so<br />\nunportentously back in February<br />\nwith a two-week committee, will<br />\nhave been for naught!!<br />\nShould the referendum pass or<br />\nnot:this week's vote will dispose<br />\nat one stroke of the controversy<br />\nand concern over the alternative<br />\nto the Honor System. And when<br />\nit's all over, Gilman Hall itself<br />\nwill likely heave an audible sigh<br />\nof relief<br />\n<br />\n\fIf you missed Warhol's 'Chelsea girls,try the museum<br />\nBy GEORGE B.

Some say it<br />\nwas the influence of the old<br />\nhumbug that prevailed upon the<br />\nleaders of the Democratic party<br />\nto give Baltimore a break. In any<br />\ncase, the Democratic convention<br />\nwas held here in 1872. Horace<br />\nGreeley, who didn't coin the<br />\nPhrase \"Go West, young man\"<br />\nbut rather managed to run it into<br />\nthe ground, took the nomination.<br />\nInspired by Horace's famous<br />\ncliche, which he managed to<br />\nwork somehow into (Lis<br />\nacceptance speech, fifty delegates<br />\nwalked out of the convention<br />\nhall and started to go west. After<br />\na fifteen-mile Iiike,they tired and<br />\ndecided to stay put on the spot<br />\nwhere they wound up. Such was<br />\nthe founding of the town of<br />\nCatonsville, Maryland. Horace,<br />\ndespite all the hoopla of the<br />\nconvention and the defection to<br />\nhis side of a segment of the<br />\nRepublican party, didn't do too<br />\nwell against Grant in the general<br />\nelection. The fact that Horace<br />\ndied before the election was held<br />\nprobably had something to do<br />\nwith a lot of people voting for<br />\nGrant, who, if not very astute<br />\npolitically, was still \"viable\", so<br />\nto speak. Of course, Greeley's<br />\nPremature demise was attributed<br />\nback to the Baltimore jinx;<br />\nBaltimore was again out of<br />\nbusiness as Convention City,<br />\nU.S.A. and stayed that way until<br />\n1912, when ex-Hoppie Woodrow<br />\nWilson got the nod at the<br />\nmother-ugly Fifth Regiment<br />\nArmory on Preston Street.

Desperate times<br />\nbrought forth desperate schemes.<br />\nUrban historian James Breslin has<br />\nrecently discovered the diary of<br />\nBaltimore mayor Ferdinand<br />\nLatrobe, in which the mayor<br />\ndescribes how a professional<br />\narsonist, Marvin the Torch, gave<br />\nthe city council the idea for the<br />\n-Great Baltimore Fire. \"There's<br />\nno way business will improve,.'<br />\nMarvin told the people's<br />\nrepresentatives. \"You better cut<br />\nyour losses while you can and<br />\ncollect your insurance money.<br />\nThat's where I come in. You see<br />\nthis central business<br />\ndistrict\u2014(Marvin pointed out the<br />\nwindow of City Hall)\u2014I'm gonna<br />\ntake it and build you an empty<br />\nlot!\"<br />\nMarvin's proposal was relayed<br />\nto the Board of Estimates, which<br />\nbody decided the Torch's price<br />\nwas too high. The city would be<br />\nbetter off hiring a local amateur<br />\nto do the job on the city. The<br />\nBoard's recommendation was<br />\nsent back to the council for<br />\ndebate in the summer of 1875.<br />\nAfter extensive debate, the city<br />\nfathers decided upon a plan of<br />\naction. It was now 1904\u2014five<br />\nother depressions had since made<br />\ntheir mark since Greeley's<br />\nRevenge. I hate to end on an<br />\nsave the<br />\napocalyptic note, so<br />\nfor the<br />\nFire<br />\nGreat<br />\nthe<br />\ndetails of<br />\nnext installment of this work, in<br />\nwhich I will also discuss H.

He was somewhat amused<br />\nby a microphone-flourishing<br />\nwoman from PBS Radio (well<br />\nlubricated by several glasses of<br />\nthe complimentary Paul Masson<br />\nChablis), who was strikingly<br />\nreminiscent of Opal, the<br />\nincredibly shallow British<br />\njournalist who plagued Altman's<br />\nNashville. She seemed intent on<br />\ntell ing Warhol about Warhol,<br />\nBaltimore, herself, his Jockey<br />\nshorts and other less notable<br />\nlandmarks. The woman made a<br />\nlegitimate attempt at contesting<br />\nEdith Massey (also known as<br />\nDivine, from Pink Flamingos and<br />\nFemale Trouble) for the<br />\ndistinction of being the strangest<br />\nwoman Warhol ever met.<br />\nWarhol's future clans had<br />\n<br />\nincluded a low-budget movie and<br />\ntwo more books. However, the<br />\nmovie (tentatively titled Bad<br />\nWomen) suffered a set-back when<br />\nhis financial supporter walked<br />\nout, two days ago. The movie<br />\nwill go on, with Warhol<br />\nproducing. Terming all of his<br />\nwork as \"entertainment\", Warhol<br />\nreiterated his belief in art as<br />\nentertainment.<br />\nThe token Warhol cultist in<br />\n<br />\nattendance asked Andy to<br />\ndisplay his now highly publicized<br />\nscars (the result of a near-fatal<br />\nshooting), but Warhol demurred,<br />\noffering \"some nice<br />\nphotographs\" instead.<br />\nLooking fatigued towards the<br />\nend, Warhol commented that<br />\n\"Archie probably would have<br />\nmade a better interview.\"<br />\nMaybe so, but Archie isn't<br />\nAndy Warhol.<br />\n<br />\nElvis,Mona, Mao, Soup,Warhol<br />\nyou can't even draw a ripe<br />\nbook?

And to be sure,<br />\nthe Dean's Office had had<br />\nenough legal hassles with the<br />\nsupposedly air-tight Honor<br />\nSystem.

And get<br />\nproof they did.<br />\nPoll<br />\nThe committee, on its two<br />\nweek research furlough,<br />\nconducted an anonymous poll of<br />\nstudents in large science survey<br />\ncourses, which asked the<br />\nstudents, among other questions,<br />\nif they had ever cheated on an<br />\nexam at Hopkins. The results<br />\nwere staggering. A terribly high,<br />\nembarrassingly high percentage<br />\nadmitted to having cheated. The<br />\nBaltimore Sun picked up on it.<br />\nThe News American picked up<br />\non it. Faculty members spoke in<br />\nhushed tones of the demise of<br />\nthe Honor System.<br />\nOne member of the Physics<br />\nfaculty reportedly suggested that<br />\nall the students who had<br />\nconfessed to cheating be<br />\napprehended and penalized<br />\nappropriately. It was pointed out<br />\nthat the survey was anoymous,<br />\nand that no matter how<br />\nsophisticated the techniques of<br />\ndetection, the handwriting on the<br />\nballots would surely not admit of<br />\nany conclusive deducation<br />\nconcerning individuality.<br />\nOne member of the committee<br />\ntheorized that perhaps the<br />\nstudents who had admitted to<br />\ncheating were not really guilty.<br />\nWas not confession akin to<br />\nabsolution, he inquired. Were<br />\nthey really guilty?<br />\nYeah, they were guilty; guilty<br />\nas hell. So the Student Council<br /><br />\nhad proof on its hands\u2014along<br />\nwith 2, alarmed faculty<br />\nmembers who were demanding<br />\nthat the governance for academic<br />\noffenses be revised with alacrity.<br />\nSo the Student Council sent out<br />\na new committee, comprised of<br />\nmost of the members of the old<br />\ncommittee and some interested<br />\nand respected professors, to find<br />\na viable alternative to the Honor<br />\nSystem. The rhetoric of the new<br />\ncommittee abounded with such<br />\nterms as viability, feasibility,<br />\nlegality, effectuality, and<br />\nintegrity.<br />\nThis was to be an efficient<br />\ncommittee which would produce<br />\nan acceptable alternative, and<br />\nwith due haste. For the end of<br />\nschool was waxing near, and the<br />\nwhole matter would have to be<br />\nput to student referendum before<br />\nsummer recess. So the new<br />\ncommittee burnt the midnight oil<br />\nto come up with an alternative<br />\nbefore the end of the semester.<br />\nAnd they did it. And it went to<br />\nstudent referendum. And the<br />\nstudents passed it. And all was<br />\n\"as it was before...\"<br />\nExcept that it just wouldn't<br />\ndo. The proposal was too ragged,<br />\ntoo vague in regard to legal<br />\ntechnicalities; in general, too<br />\nhastily compiled. It would have<br />\nto be rewritten. So the Student<br />\nCouncil and the Academic<br />\nCouncil, which was by now<br />\nimmersed in the turmoil, sent out<br />\na \"task force\" to rewrite the<br />\ndocument.<br />\nSo eight good students and<br />\nprofessors did spend their<br />\nsummer and early fall working on<br />\nthe alternative, perhaps<br />\nwondering occasionally whence<br />\nthe need for this effort had<br />\nsprang.<br />\nBut now that they're done, the<br />\ndocument will have to go back to<br />\nstudent referendum, because it's<br />\na different document than the<br />\none the students passed last<br />\nspring.<br />\nAnd it's precisely here that a<br />\nharrowing possibility arises.<br />\nSuppose the students don't pass<br />\nit. Suppose out of ignorance,<br />\ndisinterest, or sheer funk, they<br />\nvote it down.

In any<br />\ncase, the Democratic convention<br />\nwas held here in 1872.

Horace,<br />\ndespite all the hoopla of the<br />\nconvention and the defection to<br />\nhis side of a segment of the<br />\nRepublican party, didn't do too<br />\nwell against Grant in the general<br />\nelection. The fact that Horace<br />\ndied before the election was held<br />\nprobably had something to do<br />\nwith a lot of people voting for<br />\nGrant, who, if not very astute<br />\npolitically, was still \"viable\", so<br />\nto speak.
