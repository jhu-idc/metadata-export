Franke<br />\n<br />\nInvitation To Speak<br />\nWhat we ask, simply, is that Dr. Lincoln Gordon, the newly instated President of Hopkins, whom no one except the freshmen<br />\nhave yet seen or heard, speak to his own university on the very<br />\nmatters which he has spoken to other groups. What students and<br />\nfaculty know of the man who holds the future of this university so<br />\nstrongly in his hands is this: optimistically, he is an able educator<br />\nand he is well respected among government and foundation circles<br />\nfrom whom we receive a large part of our funds; pessimistically, he<br />\nhas had no university administrative experience, he seems unable<br />\nto clearly understand student desires for participatory functions in<br />\nuniversity reform,he seems to have been in Latin America too long<br />\nto understand the present (not to be confused with past) questioning and criticism by youth, and he seems profoundly inaccessible<br />\nto his own students and faculty.<br />\nPresident Gordon arrived here with as clean a slate as possible,<br />\nand we were hopeful that with a new leader we as students could<br />\ntake a more active part in the workings of the university which directly affect us,as other universities have enabled their students to<br />\ndo. We were initially troubled by what seemed lack of perception<br />\nof American (that is,of the United States) youth when he equated<br />\nthe \"aberration of the alienated\" with the \"aberration of the direct activists\". Also, we saw that a liberalizing trend here would<br />\nnot ensue when he made it more than clear that he was against any<br />\nstudent participation in administrative affairs. We also wondered<br />\nat his tendency to equate thoroughly Communist oriented and revolutionary inclined Latin American students with our own far<br />\nmore reasonable and,we hope,intelligent students in this country.<br />\nIn his most recent speech, to the Middle States Association of<br />\nColleges and Secondary Schools in Atlantic City last week, Dr.<br />\nGordon reiterated many of the ideas he expressed to the incoming<br />\nfreshmen in September.<br />\nMost of his views we agree with: that American education is excellent,that \"there is a new awareness(of social inequities) at odds<br />\nwith our professed values of equal opportunity for all, \"that students tend to reflect \"social malaise in amplified degree,\" that people who seek power for its own sake are aberrant, etc., etc. We do,<br />\nhowever, deplore the President's sweeping chastisements of all<br />\nS.D.S. members (\"nihilistic\"), many of the N.S.A. leaders (\"nihilistic\"), student newspapers (\"nihilistic\"), demonstrators (\"nihilistic\") and other such types. The fact is that not all there, and<br />\nvery few at Hopkins, are nihilists. Sadly, Dr. Gordon has made the<br />\nvery generalizations about students which lmany people whom he<br />\nconsiders nihilistic are trying to erase from older minds.<br />\n<br />\nAge For Reason<br />\nIn the last week,both the Harris and Gallup polls have reported<br />\nsharp increases in President Johnson's popularity and in the American public's support of his war effort. It comes as a sad shock after the long and sustained trend of questioning and repudiation of<br />\nthe war effort among what was nearing 50 percent of the people<br />\nin this country. And it is sad that Johnson's increased popularity<br />\nis above all a reaction to the many recent demonstrations which<br />\nhave been directed against peripheral actors and ambiguous issues<br />\nin the war, rather than against the war itself.<br />\nThe pitiful demonstration by a handful of Hopkins students<br />\nagainst a Dow recruiter here Monday was one of many such protests which have recently taken place. Granted that Dow does<br />\nmanufacture napalm, along with countless other products which<br />\nwe use every day, and napalm does kill people in Vietnam, but<br />\nnevertheless the only effect such a demonstration has is to alienate thousands of concerned business men,housewives and students<br />\nwho otherwise could effectively participate in the anti-war<br />\nmovement.<br />\nAs sad as it is, napalm is an instrument of war. Protesters can<br />\nprotest it, but it will continue to be produced, the military will<br />\ncontinue to use it, and babies will continue to be burned. Too<br />\nmany people today,in their demagogic polemics, have lost sight of<br />\nthe main concern of most people in this country - - to end the<br />\nfrustrating, costly and murderious war which is so seriously dividing the nation. A withdrawal must be immediate, but by protesting Dow Chemical (perhaps the furthest notch down in the huge<br />\nbureaucracy of the war effort) and other such side issues, nothing<br />\nwill be achieved except more bitterness, domestically and internationally, and further prolongation of the war.<br />\nRamparts, the bastion of the far left, spoke of James Reston in<br />\nits most recent issue as the epitomy of the \"reasonable\" man concerned with bringing about the end of the disastrous war through<br />\nthe democratic process. The magazine went on to rebuke Reston<br />\nfor such idealism, inferring that the only way we could achieve<br />\npeace now was through abandoning legal procedures and resorting<br />\nto some apocalyptic embarrassment of the government through<br />\ncivil disobedience. Such views are understandable considering the<br />\ntotal lack of results achieved in October's peace march, the gross<br />\ndistortions of the march by the mass media, the inaccessabilitv of<br />\ngovernment ears, and in general the total frustration and despair<br />\nfelt by all people, especially youths, who are against the involvement in Vietnam. Nevertheless,Ramparts,and others who defend<br />\ncivil disobedience are forgetting the psychological harm they are<br />\ndoing to the cause. The increase in Johnson's popularity is due<br />\nprecisely to such demonstrators, who have alienated the \"unheard<br />\nmiddle\" from their mutual goal- to end the war.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,DECEMBER 8, 1967<br />\n<br />\nI Subway Homesick Blues 1<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nOne of the Inevitables stands<br />\nup during a Dylan concert. He<br />\nusually has a date,likes to think of<br />\nhimself as pretty well up on things,<br />\nis very ethnic and has enough<br />\nmoney for two of the impossible<br />\nto get orchestra seats. He stands<br />\nup at the worst possible moment<br />\n(he has a sense of timing for such<br />\nthings) and starts yelling at the<br />\nstage: \"speak, Dylan, speak\" Dylan keeps on singing and the young<br />\nbore goes on shouting \"say something, Dylan\" and is joined by a<br />\nfew similar specimens until the<br />\nconcert becomes a shouting match<br />\nbetween Dylan trying to get his<br />\nsound across and half a dozen<br />\nmorons asking him to \"say something\".<br />\nAnd that's just the point of<br />\nDon't Look Back. The movie is<br />\nnot there to propagate any message or to spark violent controversy, to answer yes's or no's. It just<br />\nasks you, only for a couple of<br />\nhours, to shut your psuedo-intellectual mouth and to listen and<br />\nand just to watch:<br />\n* See Dylan capturing and confronting Donovan,\"the other folksinger.\"<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n* See Dylan tell it as it is to a<br />\ncollege interviewer Inevitable, even<br />\nto the Inevitable reporter from the<br />\nInevitable Time magazine.<br />\n* See Joan Baez kissing the<br />\nhero's fevered brow.<br />\n* See the evil machination of<br />\nevil big business show business<br />\nagents.<br />\n* See fleeting glimses of Allan<br />\nGinsberg and other famous people.<br />\n* See filled concert halls,screaming, applauding.<br />\nSo What?<br />\nSee scenes and scenes and scenes<br />\nand if it doesn't mean anything to<br />\nyou than a random group of scenes, so what? There are funny<br />\nparts, you'll get your two dollars<br />\nworth. But don't go there expecting to listen to some narrator make<br />\nyour value judgements for you.<br />\nDon't bemoan lacks of\"message,\"<br />\n\"social significance\" or whatever<br />\nelse you look for for kicks in a<br />\nmovie. Don't Look Back, like Dylan himself,is nothing more than a<br />\npresentation, a portrait, a documentary. It \"tells it as it is\" if<br />\nthat's your opinion of\"how it is\"<br />\nand if you have no opinion its all<br />\nthe same - - really, feel safe, no-<br />\n<br />\nbody is going to ask you to say a<br />\nword.<br />\nIf you like, you may comment<br />\nthat the movie is old, two and a<br />\nhalf years old, ancient when measured by the standards of popular<br />\nmusic. Since it was made, Dylan<br />\nhas changed his style (\"sold out\"<br />\n- - depending, again, on your opinion, if you have one), crashed his<br />\nmotorcycle, gotten married, has a<br />\nkid, has disappeared from the<br />\nworld of the living. You could<br />\nmake a lot of money compiling a<br />\nbook of the rumors of what has<br />\nhappened to him: Is Dylan dead?<br />\nIs Dylan a hopeless speed freak?<br />\nHas Dylan been exposed for what<br />\nhe really is - - a ranting raving<br />\nmononucleic lesbian dwarf? Does<br />\nit matter?<br />\nHis work is there and stands by<br />\nitself - - the always growing number of his imitators verifies that.<br />\nDon't Look Back, is also there<br />\ndown at this theater on North<br />\nAvenue, not there as the exclusive<br />\nproperty of the Howard Street hippies just as he is not there for the<br />\nsole purpose of providing a permanent shock for old lady Reader's<br />\nDigest fans. He's, it's, just there.<br />\nAnd all you have to do is look.<br />\n<br />\nGames People Play<br />\n<br />\nBy MICHAEL G. MICHAELSON<br />\nSomewhere between the idealized worlds of chess and Monopoly<br />\nlies the vast and infinitely more<br />\ncomplicated gameboard of reality.<br />\nNo one will deny the primitive<br />\nthrill of abandoning one's life and<br />\nfortune, houses, hotels, railroads<br />\nand utilities, to the fickle throw of<br />\nthe dice. Few pleasures can compete with the quasi-orgasmic joy<br />\nof a series of carefully planned<br />\nmaneuvers of knight, bishop and<br />\nqueen culminating in a well executed \"Checkmate.\" But even the reluctant mentalities of a football<br />\ncoach or army general will be forced to admit that when it comes<br />\ndown to the real aitty-gritty, at<br />\nfourth - and - one or at Zero Hour,<br />\nneither luck nor skill is uniquely<br />\nresponsible, to the total exclusion<br />\nof the other, for the outcome. No<br />\none lands on Free Parking without<br />\nworking for it, and the most scrupulously fortified queen can be<br />\nrudely slapped on the rump.<br />\nSo to fill the gap in parlor recreation between probability and<br />\nstatistics, a new concept, the<br />\n\"adult game,\" was introduced<br />\nabout ten years ago. Avalon Hill<br />\nwas the pioneering company in the<br />\nfield, and its first product was<br />\nGETTYSBURG, a game in which<br />\nthe actual conditions of the historic battle were re-produced right<br />\ndown to the type of terrain, the<br />\nnumber of loops, the division of<br />\nthose troops among the various<br />\ngenerals, and the relative power of<br />\neach division. If each battle was<br />\nstill decided by a throw of the<br />\ndice, the outcome was also influenced, often decisively, by the<br />\nelan with which a particular commander brought his troops to bear<br />\nagainst the enemy - - - the ratio of<br />\nmen, flanking manueuvers, etc. So<br />\nthe outcome was not a matter of<br />\nluck alone (\"Let's see - - Boardwalk with four hotels - - you owe<br />\nme S136,417.14\") or of unadulterated skill (\"Queen's bishop to<br />\nking's knight two - - that's Mate in<br />\ntwo moves\") but of the far more<br />\nrealistic interplay of both. Pickett.<br />\nif he played it right, might not<br />\nhave to charge.<br />\nColeman Approach<br />\nIt was not long of course before<br />\nsomeone hit upon the idea of<br />\ntransposing such \"reality games\"<br />\nfrom the battlefields of the past to<br />\nthe crises of the present. In fact,<br />\n<br />\nProfessor James Coleman of the<br />\nsociology department has discovered in just such an approach what<br />\nmay prove to be a significant<br />\nbreakthrough in the American<br />\neducational<br />\nprocess. Because<br />\ngames can reflect reality so accurately, and because kids play games<br />\nso enthusiastically and so well, he<br />\nhas designed a method of introducing the adolescent to one of<br />\nAmerica's favorite and most complex pastimes - - politics, Dr. Coleman's -game permits the player to<br />\nassume the identity of a make-believe legislator who is presented<br />\nwith the make-believe voting patterns of his make-believe constituents about some make-believe<br />\nissues, all selected rather arbitrarily at random. The legislator plays<br />\nthe game by making deals with<br />\nanyone and everyone in order to<br />\nget the bills his people want<br />\nthrough. His sole object of course:<br />\nto get himself reelected - - - which,<br />\nsome cynics may argue, is not so<br />\nterribly make believe. And so the<br />\nhappy tenth graders learn what<br />\nCivics is all about.<br />\nAnd so games continue to<br />\nevolve, becoming more and more<br />\nreal and more and more relevant.<br />\nWitness this recent addition, advertised in the November 25 issue<br />\nof the New Republic, page 35:<br />\n\"Why frustrate yourself any<br />\nlonger'? Why let a few high officials have all the fun'? Now you too<br />\ncan play CREDIBILITY GAP, the<br />\nslashing and hilarious new game<br />\nfor all patriotic Americans.\"<br />\nThe game, the small print reveals. is designed for anyone over<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nthirteen who suspects \"that a few<br />\nimportant officials in Washington<br />\nhave been having a grand old time<br />\ntossing out fibs on every conceivable topic\" and contains two sets<br />\nof playing cards which provide<br />\nsome indication of how far gamesmanship has come since the grand<br />\nold days of \"Take a Chance\" and<br />\n\"Community Chest.\" One team<br />\ngets the \"Citizen's Playing Deck\"<br />\nwhile the opposition deals from<br />\n(the bottom of, I would assume)<br />\n\"an Administration Pack of Lies.\"<br />\nAlso included in the box are \"4<br />\nLiberty Bell counters, 90 Truth<br />\nTrophies, dice, rules and a colorful<br />\ngame board richly sprinkled with<br />\namusing inscriptions,\" all of which<br />\nhelp the player \"uncover an entertaining variety of bureaucratic untruths\" and ultimately to win his<br />\nway to the coveted and elusive<br />\n\"Truth Vault.\"<br />\nEscalation, Baby<br />\n\"Here at last,\" the ad exults,.<br />\n\"is your chance to joing the fun,'<br />\nand here, too, is the latest symbol<br />\nof a trend which may have a profound effect not only upon citizens of the United States, but of<br />\nthe World. Who, for example, will<br />\nbe able to resist the sado-masochistic urge to finally play his very<br />\nown game of ESCALATION which<br />\nwill doubtlessly soon make its<br />\nlong-awaited debut on the American scene. Although players will<br />\nbe forced to wear jungle boots and<br />\ninsect repellent, this disadvantage<br />\nwill be more than compensated for<br />\nby the thrill of commanding one<br />\nof three armies: The Red White<br />\nand Blue Army of massive size and<br />\n(having been recruited from a pool<br />\nof graduate students and intellectuals) the most intelligent and<br />\nleast efficient army in the world:<br />\nthe Yellow Army which eats well<br />\nand smiles but falls apart upon<br />\ncontact: or the Green Army which<br />\nis young and small, but which<br />\npossesses the advantage of a protective coloration and is often<br />\nbarely distinguishable from the<br />\nplaying board itself.

After a rather agonizing 1-8<br />\nseason the Jays finished fourth<br />\nout of ten teams in the MasonDixon Conference Championships, and fifth in the Middle Atlantic Conference College Division (eleven teams entered.)<br />\nHaving lost only two seniors<br />\nthrough graduation, Coach William<br />\nKlarner is setting his sights on new<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\nFLUFF DRY & FOLD<br />\nSHIRTS\u2014DRY CLEANING<br />\n<br />\nWaverly Laundromat<br />\n3331 GREENMOUNT AVE.<br />\n467-2123<br />\n<br />\nhigher goals - even hinting at possible division championship.s While<br />\nthis seems out of the picture,<br />\nstrictly from a lack of any real<br />\ndepth, at least the optimism is a<br />\nhealthy sign.<br />\nHenry, Moore Return<br />\nA young team, the Jays are<br />\ncomposed with two exceptions, of<br />\njuniors and sophomores. Co-Captain Al Henry and breastroker<br />\nRich Moore comprise the last remnants of the dismal team that first<br />\ninvaded Hopkins' sleek pool back<br />\nin the dark ages. Henry, a freestyler scored consistently in the<br />\nsprints last year and has thus far<br />\nlooked good in practice. Second<br />\nhigh point scorer last season, he<br />\nalong with junior letterman Noel<br />\nBurnham, compose Hopkins chief<br />\nthreats in the 50 and 100 yd. races.<br />\nThe other Co-Captain, Howard<br />\nChernick has thus far been Hopkins' sole claim to swimming fame.<br />\nA junior, he swept all but one of<br />\nhis 200yd. butterfly races last season and finished first in both the<br />\n100 and 200 yd. events in both<br />\nconference tourneys.

After a slow<br />\nstart, due to an injury, Wilson is<br />\nagain finding his championship<br />\nform.<br />\nExcept for Henry, Chernick,<br />\nWilson and Burnham, the Jays<br />\nseem questionable. Much of this<br />\nyear's success will rest on conditioning. The team's lack of depth<br />\nwill have to make up in endurance.<br />\nIn a concentrated effort to overcome the depth deficiency, Coach<br />\nKlarner has been conducting sprint<br />\nworkouts daily. First results will<br />\nbe seen on Dec. 16, when Hopkins<br />\nopens its season at Swarthmore.<br />\nTo compensate for the graduation of breaststroker Rich Tomasulo, Klarner has switched Junior<br />\nletterman Josh Treem from the<br />\nindividual medley to the breaststroke. Junior Brian Turners should<br />\nalso help in that event. Klarner is<br />\nalso hoping that junior transfer<br />\nstudent Vaughn Weikel will be<br />\nable to fill the previously woefully weak distance vents.

Toll<br /><br />\nPeter J. Koper<br /><br />\nBUSINESS MANAGERS<br />\nDavid S. Cooper<br /><br />\nJames N. Franke<br /><br />\nInvitation To Speak<br />\nWhat we ask, simply, is that Dr. Lincoln Gordon, the newly instated President of Hopkins, whom no one except the freshmen<br />\nhave yet seen or heard, speak to his own university on the very<br />\nmatters which he has spoken to other groups. What students and<br />\nfaculty know of the man who holds the future of this university so<br />\nstrongly in his hands is this: optimistically, he is an able educator<br />\nand he is well respected among government and foundation circles<br />\nfrom whom we receive a large part of our funds; pessimistically, he<br />\nhas had no university administrative experience, he seems unable<br />\nto clearly understand student desires for participatory functions in<br />\nuniversity reform,he seems to have been in Latin America too long<br />\nto understand the present (not to be confused with past) questioning and criticism by youth, and he seems profoundly inaccessible<br />\nto his own students and faculty.<br />\nPresident Gordon arrived here with as clean a slate as possible,<br />\nand we were hopeful that with a new leader we as students could<br />\ntake a more active part in the workings of the university which directly affect us,as other universities have enabled their students to<br />\ndo. We were initially troubled by what seemed lack of perception<br />\nof American (that is,of the United States) youth when he equated<br />\nthe \"aberration of the alienated\" with the \"aberration of the direct activists\". Also, we saw that a liberalizing trend here would<br />\nnot ensue when he made it more than clear that he was against any<br />\nstudent participation in administrative affairs. We also wondered<br />\nat his tendency to equate thoroughly Communist oriented and revolutionary inclined Latin American students with our own far<br />\nmore reasonable and,we hope,intelligent students in this country.<br />\nIn his most recent speech, to the Middle States Association of<br />\nColleges and Secondary Schools in Atlantic City last week, Dr.<br />\nGordon reiterated many of the ideas he expressed to the incoming<br />\nfreshmen in September.<br />\nMost of his views we agree with: that American education is excellent,that \"there is a new awareness(of social inequities) at odds<br />\nwith our professed values of equal opportunity for all, \"that students tend to reflect \"social malaise in amplified degree,\" that people who seek power for its own sake are aberrant, etc., etc. We do,<br />\nhowever, deplore the President's sweeping chastisements of all<br />\nS.D.S. members (\"nihilistic\"), many of the N.S.A. leaders (\"nihilistic\"), student newspapers (\"nihilistic\"), demonstrators (\"nihilistic\") and other such types. The fact is that not all there, and<br />\nvery few at Hopkins, are nihilists. Sadly, Dr. Gordon has made the<br />\nvery generalizations about students which lmany people whom he<br />\nconsiders nihilistic are trying to erase from older minds.<br /><br />\nAge For Reason<br />\nIn the last week,both the Harris and Gallup polls have reported<br />\nsharp increases in President Johnson's popularity and in the American public's support of his war effort. It comes as a sad shock after the long and sustained trend of questioning and repudiation of<br />\nthe war effort among what was nearing 50 percent of the people<br />\nin this country. And it is sad that Johnson's increased popularity<br />\nis above all a reaction to the many recent demonstrations which<br />\nhave been directed against peripheral actors and ambiguous issues<br />\nin the war, rather than against the war itself.<br />\nThe pitiful demonstration by a handful of Hopkins students<br />\nagainst a Dow recruiter here Monday was one of many such protests which have recently taken place. Granted that Dow does<br />\nmanufacture napalm, along with countless other products which<br />\nwe use every day, and napalm does kill people in Vietnam, but<br />\nnevertheless the only effect such a demonstration has is to alienate thousands of concerned business men,housewives and students<br />\nwho otherwise could effectively participate in the anti-war<br />\nmovement.<br />\nAs sad as it is, napalm is an instrument of war. Protesters can<br />\nprotest it, but it will continue to be produced, the military will<br />\ncontinue to use it, and babies will continue to be burned. Too<br />\nmany people today,in their demagogic polemics, have lost sight of<br />\nthe main concern of most people in this country - - to end the<br />\nfrustrating, costly and murderious war which is so seriously dividing the nation. A withdrawal must be immediate, but by protesting Dow Chemical (perhaps the furthest notch down in the huge<br />\nbureaucracy of the war effort) and other such side issues, nothing<br />\nwill be achieved except more bitterness, domestically and internationally, and further prolongation of the war.<br />\nRamparts, the bastion of the far left, spoke of James Reston in<br />\nits most recent issue as the epitomy of the \"reasonable\" man concerned with bringing about the end of the disastrous war through<br />\nthe democratic process. The magazine went on to rebuke Reston<br />\nfor such idealism, inferring that the only way we could achieve<br />\npeace now was through abandoning legal procedures and resorting<br />\nto some apocalyptic embarrassment of the government through<br />\ncivil disobedience. Such views are understandable considering the<br />\ntotal lack of results achieved in October's peace march, the gross<br />\ndistortions of the march by the mass media, the inaccessabilitv of<br />\ngovernment ears, and in general the total frustration and despair<br />\nfelt by all people, especially youths, who are against the involvement in Vietnam. Nevertheless,Ramparts,and others who defend<br />\ncivil disobedience are forgetting the psychological harm they are<br />\ndoing to the cause. The increase in Johnson's popularity is due<br />\nprecisely to such demonstrators, who have alienated the \"unheard<br />\nmiddle\" from their mutual goal- to end the war.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,DECEMBER 8, 1967<br /><br />\nI Subway Homesick Blues 1<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nOne of the Inevitables stands<br />\nup during a Dylan concert. He<br />\nusually has a date,likes to think of<br />\nhimself as pretty well up on things,<br />\nis very ethnic and has enough<br />\nmoney for two of the impossible<br />\nto get orchestra seats. He stands<br />\nup at the worst possible moment<br />\n(he has a sense of timing for such<br />\nthings) and starts yelling at the<br />\nstage: \"speak, Dylan, speak\" Dylan keeps on singing and the young<br />\nbore goes on shouting \"say something, Dylan\" and is joined by a<br />\nfew similar specimens until the<br />\nconcert becomes a shouting match<br />\nbetween Dylan trying to get his<br />\nsound across and half a dozen<br />\nmorons asking him to \"say something\".<br />\nAnd that's just the point of<br />\nDon't Look Back. The movie is<br />\nnot there to propagate any message or to spark violent controversy, to answer yes's or no's. It just<br />\nasks you, only for a couple of<br />\nhours, to shut your psuedo-intellectual mouth and to listen and<br />\nand just to watch:<br />\n* See Dylan capturing and confronting Donovan,\"the other folksinger.\"<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n* See Dylan tell it as it is to a<br />\ncollege interviewer Inevitable, even<br />\nto the Inevitable reporter from the<br />\nInevitable Time magazine.<br />\n* See Joan Baez kissing the<br />\nhero's fevered brow.<br />\n* See the evil machination of<br />\nevil big business show business<br />\nagents.<br />\n* See fleeting glimses of Allan<br />\nGinsberg and other famous people.<br />\n* See filled concert halls,screaming, applauding.<br />\nSo What?<br />\nSee scenes and scenes and scenes<br />\nand if it doesn't mean anything to<br />\nyou than a random group of scenes, so what? There are funny<br />\nparts, you'll get your two dollars<br />\nworth. But don't go there expecting to listen to some narrator make<br />\nyour value judgements for you.<br />\nDon't bemoan lacks of\"message,\"<br />\n\"social significance\" or whatever<br />\nelse you look for for kicks in a<br />\nmovie. Don't Look Back, like Dylan himself,is nothing more than a<br />\npresentation, a portrait, a documentary. It \"tells it as it is\" if<br />\nthat's your opinion of\"how it is\"<br />\nand if you have no opinion its all<br />\nthe same - - really, feel safe, no-<br /><br />\nbody is going to ask you to say a<br />\nword.<br />\nIf you like, you may comment<br />\nthat the movie is old, two and a<br />\nhalf years old, ancient when measured by the standards of popular<br />\nmusic. Since it was made, Dylan<br />\nhas changed his style (\"sold out\"<br />\n- - depending, again, on your opinion, if you have one), crashed his<br />\nmotorcycle, gotten married, has a<br />\nkid, has disappeared from the<br />\nworld of the living. You could<br />\nmake a lot of money compiling a<br />\nbook of the rumors of what has<br />\nhappened to him: Is Dylan dead?<br />\nIs Dylan a hopeless speed freak?<br />\nHas Dylan been exposed for what<br />\nhe really is - - a ranting raving<br />\nmononucleic lesbian dwarf? Does<br />\nit matter?<br />\nHis work is there and stands by<br />\nitself - - the always growing number of his imitators verifies that.<br />\nDon't Look Back, is also there<br />\ndown at this theater on North<br />\nAvenue, not there as the exclusive<br />\nproperty of the Howard Street hippies just as he is not there for the<br />\nsole purpose of providing a permanent shock for old lady Reader's<br />\nDigest fans. He's, it's, just there.<br />\nAnd all you have to do is look.<br /><br />\nGames People Play<br /><br />\nBy MICHAEL G. MICHAELSON<br />\nSomewhere between the idealized worlds of chess and Monopoly<br />\nlies the vast and infinitely more<br />\ncomplicated gameboard of reality.<br />\nNo one will deny the primitive<br />\nthrill of abandoning one's life and<br />\nfortune, houses, hotels, railroads<br />\nand utilities, to the fickle throw of<br />\nthe dice. Few pleasures can compete with the quasi-orgasmic joy<br />\nof a series of carefully planned<br />\nmaneuvers of knight, bishop and<br />\nqueen culminating in a well executed \"Checkmate.\" But even the reluctant mentalities of a football<br />\ncoach or army general will be forced to admit that when it comes<br />\ndown to the real aitty-gritty, at<br />\nfourth - and - one or at Zero Hour,<br />\nneither luck nor skill is uniquely<br />\nresponsible, to the total exclusion<br />\nof the other, for the outcome. No<br />\none lands on Free Parking without<br />\nworking for it, and the most scrupulously fortified queen can be<br />\nrudely slapped on the rump.<br />\nSo to fill the gap in parlor recreation between probability and<br />\nstatistics, a new concept, the<br />\n\"adult game,\" was introduced<br />\nabout ten years ago. Avalon Hill<br />\nwas the pioneering company in the<br />\nfield, and its first product was<br />\nGETTYSBURG, a game in which<br />\nthe actual conditions of the historic battle were re-produced right<br />\ndown to the type of terrain, the<br />\nnumber of loops, the division of<br />\nthose troops among the various<br />\ngenerals, and the relative power of<br />\neach division. If each battle was<br />\nstill decided by a throw of the<br />\ndice, the outcome was also influenced, often decisively, by the<br />\nelan with which a particular commander brought his troops to bear<br />\nagainst the enemy - - - the ratio of<br />\nmen, flanking manueuvers, etc. So<br />\nthe outcome was not a matter of<br />\nluck alone (\"Let's see - - Boardwalk with four hotels - - you owe<br />\nme S136,417.14\") or of unadulterated skill (\"Queen's bishop to<br />\nking's knight two - - that's Mate in<br />\ntwo moves\") but of the far more<br />\nrealistic interplay of both. Pickett.<br />\nif he played it right, might not<br />\nhave to charge.<br />\nColeman Approach<br />\nIt was not long of course before<br />\nsomeone hit upon the idea of<br />\ntransposing such \"reality games\"<br />\nfrom the battlefields of the past to<br />\nthe crises of the present. In fact,<br /><br />\nProfessor James Coleman of the<br />\nsociology department has discovered in just such an approach what<br />\nmay prove to be a significant<br />\nbreakthrough in the American<br />\neducational<br />\nprocess. Because<br />\ngames can reflect reality so accurately, and because kids play games<br />\nso enthusiastically and so well, he<br />\nhas designed a method of introducing the adolescent to one of<br />\nAmerica's favorite and most complex pastimes - - politics, Dr. Coleman's -game permits the player to<br />\nassume the identity of a make-believe legislator who is presented<br />\nwith the make-believe voting patterns of his make-believe constituents about some make-believe<br />\nissues, all selected rather arbitrarily at random. The legislator plays<br />\nthe game by making deals with<br />\nanyone and everyone in order to<br />\nget the bills his people want<br />\nthrough. His sole object of course:<br />\nto get himself reelected - - - which,<br />\nsome cynics may argue, is not so<br />\nterribly make believe. And so the<br />\nhappy tenth graders learn what<br />\nCivics is all about.<br />\nAnd so games continue to<br />\nevolve, becoming more and more<br />\nreal and more and more relevant.<br />\nWitness this recent addition, advertised in the November 25 issue<br />\nof the New Republic, page 35:<br />\n\"Why frustrate yourself any<br />\nlonger'? Why let a few high officials have all the fun'? Now you too<br />\ncan play CREDIBILITY GAP, the<br />\nslashing and hilarious new game<br />\nfor all patriotic Americans.\"<br />\nThe game, the small print reveals. is designed for anyone over<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nthirteen who suspects \"that a few<br />\nimportant officials in Washington<br />\nhave been having a grand old time<br />\ntossing out fibs on every conceivable topic\" and contains two sets<br />\nof playing cards which provide<br />\nsome indication of how far gamesmanship has come since the grand<br />\nold days of \"Take a Chance\" and<br />\n\"Community Chest.\" One team<br />\ngets the \"Citizen's Playing Deck\"<br />\nwhile the opposition deals from<br />\n(the bottom of, I would assume)<br />\n\"an Administration Pack of Lies.\"<br />\nAlso included in the box are \"4<br />\nLiberty Bell counters, 90 Truth<br />\nTrophies, dice, rules and a colorful<br />\ngame board richly sprinkled with<br />\namusing inscriptions,\" all of which<br />\nhelp the player \"uncover an entertaining variety of bureaucratic untruths\" and ultimately to win his<br />\nway to the coveted and elusive<br />\n\"Truth Vault.\"<br />\nEscalation, Baby<br />\n\"Here at last,\" the ad exults,.<br />\n\"is your chance to joing the fun,'<br />\nand here, too, is the latest symbol<br />\nof a trend which may have a profound effect not only upon citizens of the United States, but of<br />\nthe World. Who, for example, will<br />\nbe able to resist the sado-masochistic urge to finally play his very<br />\nown game of ESCALATION which<br />\nwill doubtlessly soon make its<br />\nlong-awaited debut on the American scene. Although players will<br />\nbe forced to wear jungle boots and<br />\ninsect repellent, this disadvantage<br />\nwill be more than compensated for<br />\nby the thrill of commanding one<br />\nof three armies: The Red White<br />\nand Blue Army of massive size and<br />\n(having been recruited from a pool<br />\nof graduate students and intellectuals) the most intelligent and<br />\nleast efficient army in the world:<br />\nthe Yellow Army which eats well<br />\nand smiles but falls apart upon<br />\ncontact: or the Green Army which<br />\nis young and small, but which<br />\npossesses the advantage of a protective coloration and is often<br />\nbarely distinguishable from the<br />\nplaying board itself.

Co-Captain Al Henry and breastroker<br />\nRich Moore comprise the last remnants of the dismal team that first<br />\ninvaded Hopkins' sleek pool back<br />\nin the dark ages. Henry, a freestyler scored consistently in the<br />\nsprints last year and has thus far<br />\nlooked good in practice.
