I can<br />\nhonestly say it changed ma life.<br />\nNow I only work three evenings a<br />\nweek, and I make as much as I did<br />\nin one cross country run.

For<br />\nfifty years I lived in the ghetto.<br />\nThose years were bad times,<br />\nbrothers and sisters. Rats, roaches,<br />\nslumlords, badass kids, and pigs,<br />\nuh, overbearing cops. I thought I'd<br />\nnever break the cycle of poverty<br />\nuntil I saw the Temptress ad on a<br />\npiece of newspaper that I was<br />\nwrapping my sandwich with. I was<br />\na little suspicious at first, -- to tell<br />\n`ya the truth, those Temptress<br />\ndudes looked like punks to me.<br />\nBut then \u2022 they gave me the<br />\nlowdown of the winning ways of'<br />\nTemptress Pearls and now I'm<br />\nflying high these days. I've redid<br />\nmy LaFayette Street pad and<br />\n%vilely, I do some mighty fine<br />\ncooking these days. Those<br />\nTemptress dudes really got their<br />\nshit together, and so do I.<br />\nOliphatti: Yesfriends, and it can<br />\nhappen to you. And easily too.<br />\nToday, our Temptress jewelers do<br />\nnot have to pay a $500 franchise<br />\nfee.

With a curse and<br />\na quick, wet slap, he knocked the<br />\nprojector from its mounting. More<br />\ngrunts and then, re-mounting it,<br />\nreturned to his seat and turned off<br />\nthe lights.<br />\nMafiosa?<br />\nWhat followed quickly relieved<br />\nus of any illusions that this was<br />\ngoing to be our first local Mafioso<br />\nexclusive. Through the noise that<br />\nremained in the sound track,<br />\nseeming to grow louder in spite of<br />\nthe coffee vendor projectionist's<br />\nefforts, we could hear a somewhat<br />\ndiminished Bob Cummings voice<br />\nexplaining the grandeur. the<br />\ninestimable work of \"nature's<br />\nhidden treasures--cultured pearls.\"<br />\nThe film showed a Japanese pearl<br />\nfarm and described the procedures<br />\nand steps that guaranteed that<br />\n\"Temptress pearls are the best<br />\npearls in the world.\" We couldn't<br />\nbelieve it. --how in the hell could<br />\ncultured pearls in Japan be<br />\ninvolved with thr. -1,-,ucon Family?<br />\nThey weren't, in tact, there was<br />\nno Towson Family.

The<br />\ncamera hovers slowly, absorbing<br />\nthe fleshy delights and conveying<br />\nthem to the eager film-watchers,<br />\nnow sweating before the sight. The<br />\njeweler begins his come-on, reading<br />\nfrom cardboard cue cards mounted<br />\non a tripod, which when flipped<br />\nover, displays illustrations of an<br />\nisland paradise to his audience. The<br />\nproper mood created. the party<br />\nmoves on to the kitchen, where<br />\namid last week's garbage and the<br />\nday's dirty dishes, the jeweler<br />\nopens one-by-one and with<br />\nexuberant fanfare, a tray of<br />\nnot-so-fresh oysters...\"<br />\n... aren't you the lucky one, a<br />\nBaroque!

The lens zooms<br />\nclose, bringing into focus a balding<br />\nmiddle-aged man chewing on what<br />\nappears to be a day old cigar.<br />\nHello friends, as President of'<br />\nTemptress Pearls, I want to<br />\nwelcome you to our little business<br />\nchat this evening. You have<br />\nwitnessed, like thousands of<br />\nsuccessful jewelers befbre you, the<br />\nstory behind the Temptress<br />\nsuccess, and how you can become<br />\npart of our success story with our<br />\nexciting Treasure Hunt concept.<br />\nTo prove to you prospective<br />\njewelers what Temptress can do for<br />\nyou, let me introduce some \u00b0four<br />\nsatisfied Temptress jewelers.

We bolted for the door,<br />\nunsuccessfully trying to be<br />\ndiscreet. As we squeezed through<br />\nthe door, the coffee<br />\nvendor/projectionist followed,<br />\ngiving us that \"kiss of death\" look<br />\nthat we had seen all too many<br />\ntimes before. The door slammed<br />\nshut behind us, and we waited<br />\noutside in the cold Towson night,<br />\nhoping that Valduti would give us<br />\na ride home. He didn't. It was bad<br />\nenough not getting the big scoop<br />\nwe were hoping for, but having to<br />\nhitchhike back to the Gatehouse,<br />\nand then not getting a decent ride<br />\nand therefore having to walk about<br />\nseven miles certainly allowed us<br />\ntime to contemplate what fools we<br />\nhad been for even thinking that we<br />\ncould get a story out of that crazy<br />\nad.<br />\nWonder if we'd have to hoof it if<br />\nwe had become part of the<br />\nwonderful world of Temptress?<br />\nEditors' Note: This story is<br />\nmore or less true.

Then, a minute after<br />\nthe Nolan score Kowalchuk<br /><br />\nTrack team wins virtually all the laurels<br />\nBy BARRY KEMELHOR<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins track team<br />\nran away from its two<br />\ncompetitors in an impressive<br />\ntriangular-meet win last Saturday<br />\nat Homewood. The Jays amassed<br />\n99 points, totaling more than<br />\nrivals Lebonon Valley (55 pts.)<br />\nand Loyola (25) combined, to<br />\neven their season slate at 1 and I.<br />\nHopkins finished second,<br />\nbetween Swarthmore and<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, in the<br />\nseason opener two weeks ago.<br />\nAs usual, the individual star<br />\nfor the thinclads was junior<br />\nGerry Greenfield, who accounted<br />\nfor the incredible total of 21 1/4<br />\npoints--winning the 120-yard<br />\nhigh hurdles (15.6), the 220-yard<br />\ndash (23.3), the high jump (5'<br />\n8\"), and long jump (21' 5 1/4\").<br />\nThe solid day's work gave<br />\nGreenfield 36 1/4 points in two<br />\nmeets--well ahead of the pace<br />\nthat he hopes will net him 100<br />\npoints for the year. He needs to<br />\naverage just under 13 points per<br />\nmeet in the remaining five<br />\ncontests to reach that goal.<br />\nTeam Depth<br />\nSophomore Andy Schreiber<br />\nplaced second to Greenfield in<br />\nthe long jump, and added a win<br />\nin the triple jump (41' 6\") to<br />\nfinish with 9 1/4 points on the<br />\nafternoon. In addition,<br />\nGreenfield and Schreiber teamed<br />\nwith Lon Massaglia and Dan<br />\nSawyer to win the 440-yard relay<br />\nevent.<br />\nPerhaps the best team effort of<br />\nthe meet took place in the shot<br />\nput, where Al Schiff, Hal Altman<br />\nand Jim Macer finished 1-2-3,<br />\nwith Schiff's winning heave a<br /><br />\nvery respectable 45' 5\". The Blue<br />\nJays also finished 1-2 in the<br />\njavelin, with John Veil tossing<br />\nthe spear 167' to edge freshman<br />\nGeorge Stein fels.<br />\nDistance Domination<br />\nHowever, the area in which<br />\nHopkins exercised the most<br />\ncomplete domination was<br />\nundoubtedly the distance events.<br />\nThe harriers swept everything in<br />\nsight over 100 yards, as Earl<br />\nDryer took the 440; Charley<br />\nMick the 880; John Higdon the<br />\nmile; and John Tetzlaff the<br />\ntwo-mile, in addition to<br />\nGreen field's 220 triumph. In<br />\nfact, the Jays would have won<br />\nthe 100-yard dash too, had not<br />\neventual runnerup Massaglia<br />\npulled a muscle 15 yards from<br />\nthe tape. Other \"silver medalists\"<br />\nfor Hopkins included Rudy Scott<br />\nin the intermediate hurdles,<br />\nStuart Dickinson in the pole<br />\nvault, and Altman in the discus.<br />\nThings To Come<br />\nIn all, the Blue Jays won 12 of<br />\nthe 17. events, and captured well<br />\nover half of the possible 187<br />\npoints. The fine individual<br />\nshowings and times are especially<br />\nencouraging, since the<br />\ncompetition did not appear<br />\nformidable enough to produce<br />\nsuch inspirational performances,<br />\nand the winners had to prod<br />\nthemselves for the most part.
