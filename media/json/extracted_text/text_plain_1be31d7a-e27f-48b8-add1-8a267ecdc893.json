According to the nowexistent policy, students may add or drop<br />\nclasses up until the eighth week of the<br />\nsemester.<br />\nThe proposed new policy would move<br />\nthe add deadline to the second week of the<br />\nsemester, and drop date would be moved<br />\nto the sixth week. This drastic change, supported by Associate Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences P. Kyle McCarter, was offered in<br />\nan attempt to keep some students from using the present system to control their grade<br />\npoint averages and reserving space in more<br />\nclasses than their schedules allow.<br />\nThe Council has developed a counterproposal in response to this. Although it is<br />\nonly a tentative one, this proposal offers an<br />\nadd deadline even later than the one<br />\npresently in effect. Council members<br />\nbelieve that their plan would be more effective than McCarter's because it would<br />\nallow students to fill the spaces left in certain classes after the final drop deadline.<br />\nWhile the Council's proposal needs some<br />\n<br />\nrefinements, its principle certainly addresses the needs of student more appropriately than McCarter's.<br />\nMany students attend classes unofficially until places become available; sometimes<br />\nthis is not until four or five weeks into the<br />\nsemester\u2014 often after the first midterm. A<br />\ntwo-week dealine is a restrictively early<br />\none. It would permanently close students<br />\nout of classes long before others had to drop<br />\nthem; by the same token, it would keep<br />\nstudents from dropping classes if they had<br />\nno possibility of adding other classes. In the<br />\nlong run, it would limit some of the flexibility students enjoy early in the year.<br />\nStudent Council President Scott FitzGerald encouraged students to attend next<br />\nWednesday's Council meeting and express<br />\ntheir opinions about McCarter's proposal.<br />\nIf the Council's overwhelming disapproval<br />\nof the plan is indicative of student opinions<br />\nin general, then we hope FitzGerald will<br />\nhave a solid turnout on Wednesday. It is<br />\nimperative that McCarter and the Administration hear the students' views before<br />\nthey make such a critical change in the<br />\nundergraduate program.<br />\n<br />\nA Look at Numbers<br />\nThe soon to be released U.S. News &<br />\nWorld Report survey of college presidents<br />\nshows that Hopkins has been ranked sixteenth in its category, national universities.<br />\nThe ranking is surprisingly indicative of<br />\nHopkins. It suggests the good and the bad,<br />\nbut most of all it tries to correlate and quantify Hopkins' uniqueness.<br />\nWhile Hopkins is extremely wellrespected nationally in a number of fields,<br />\nthe criteria evaluated shed light on why the<br />\nranking is, in comparison to some of these<br />\nprograms, quite low. The college presidents<br />\nwere asked to take into consideration the<br />\ncohesiveness of the curriculum, the quality of teaching, the relationship between<br />\nfaculty and students, and the atmosphere<br />\nof learning fostered by the campus.<br />\nThese are the kinds of topics with which<br />\nHopkins undergrads are notoriously discontent. Regarding in particular the faculty's<br />\nconcern, manifested in time and attitude,<br />\nfor students, undergraduates have<br />\nsubstantial\u2014and valid\u2014complaints.<br />\nThe problems regarding faculty/student<br />\nrelationships and curriculum are being addressed. P. Kyle McCarter Jr., the<br />\nassociate dean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences, is responsible for an intensive<br />\n<br />\ndepartment self-evaluation to take place this<br />\nyear. Despite the apparent idealism of the<br />\nsuggestion, this quantified interpretation of<br />\nour performance in the given criteria might<br />\nprovide an impetus. Hopkins, by taking the<br />\nranking for various programs as seriously<br />\nas it does, might learn to take great pride<br />\nin any future escalation in the ranks.<br />\nThe ranking of sixteen falls in a range<br />\nthat reflects a dichotomy. Considering the<br />\nproblems in curriculum and student/faculty relations that are so apparent, the ranking is still quite high.<br />\nA somewhat legitimate response is that<br />\nHopkins is ranked so high because other institutions in its category face comparable<br />\nproblems and limitations. Although this<br />\nthought answers the question somewhat, it<br />\navoids Hopkins' attitude toward education.<br />\nHopkins' strength lies in its independent<br />\nstudy opportunities. Those opportunities,<br />\nincluding the ability to work on an individual basis with faculty starting freshman<br />\nyear, are by far more abundant than<br />\nstudents realize.<br />\nThe ranking, which is both high and yet<br />\nnot high enough, brings out the strengths<br />\nin Hopkins. A surprisingly astute survey,<br />\nif we pay attention to the numbers.<br />\n<br />\nSing a New Song...<br />\nThis week, our very own News-Letter<br />\nwas filled with song. We were inundated<br />\nwith responses from last week's \"Gala<br />\nHopkins Theme Song Quiz,\" and our staff<br />\nhas spent the past three days singing along<br />\nto these wonderful tunes. We hope the rest<br />\nof the campus enjoys these lyrics as much<br />\nas we all did.<br />\nIt becomes obvious, upon reading these<br />\nsongs, that a common thread runs<br />\nthroughout most of them. Words like<br />\n\"geek,\" \"throat,\" and \"D-level\" appear<br />\ncontinuously. For some, it might be distur-<br />\n<br />\nbing that the most appropriate Hopkins<br />\ntheme focuses on our nerd-like atmosphere,<br />\nto coin a phrase. On the other hand, these<br />\nsongs may show that this reputation is really<br />\nno more than a joke, and that we all can<br />\nlaugh at ourselves every once in a while.<br />\nMost important, though, these songs are indicative of the sharp wit and, albeit, twisted<br />\nsense of school spirit alive at Hopkins<br />\ntoday.<br />\nA big thank-you goes to all those who<br />\ncontributed; to the rest of you<br />\ngeeks . . .happy singing!<br />\n<br />\nA big proposition:<br />\nIs it worth it?<br />\nJohns Hopkins is once again on<br />\nthe leading edge of a trend<br />\namongst prestigious American<br />\nuniversities, but not in a sense of<br />\nwhich she should be proud.<br />\nUndergraduate tuition is scandalously high at many universities, but if one is an Arts and<br />\nScience major here, the situation<br />\nis one of highway robbery.<br />\nFirst, the general trend.

But I just wish to mention<br />\na funny thing that happened this<br />\nafternoon. I was walking along,<br />\nminding by own business, when<br />\nI ran into Doug Warren from the<br />\nAlumni Relations Office. I was<br />\nintroduced to Doug three years<br />\nago by Jim, who was quite good<br />\nfriends with him. Doug stopped<br />\n<br />\nme and said, \"Bruce! You have<br />\ngot to stop mentioning Jim in<br />\nyour articles.

There sure are<br />\nsome weird things here at<br />\nHopkins. There are some really<br />\n<br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\nSentimental Journey<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nCars I like, buses are okay, but<br />\ntrains I detest. They make me<br />\nfrustrated, angry, and worst of<br />\nall, mushy. It is eleven p.m., and<br />\nI am laying on a hard wooden<br />\nbench staring up at the roof of<br />\nPennsylvania Station. My wife<br />\nLisa sits beside me, and beside<br />\nher Donna, her best friend from<br />\nProvidence College. Donna has<br />\nbeen visiting over Fall Break, and<br />\nis to take the 11:04 Night Owl<br />\nback to Providence. The train is<br />\ndelayed.<br />\nI pull myself up to a sitting<br />\nposition. Donna walks to the<br />\ndoughnut shaped information<br />\nbooth and asks the Amtrak man<br />\njust how much of a delay is involved. Forty minutes, more or<br />\nless. Add twenty minutes to get<br />\nfrom DC to Baltimore, and the<br />\ntrain should arrive by 12:07.<br />\nSame old song and dance here.<br />\nHas a train ever been on time?<br />\nTwice, to my extensive<br />\nknowledge. My grandmother had<br />\njust been buried outside of<br />\nPoughkeepsie. Lisa and I had to<br />\ncatch a 9:17 back to Baltimore.<br />\nHer brother drove. We missed a<br />\nturn in New Haven.<br />\n\"Don't worry,\" I said, \"they<br />\nnever leave on time.\"<br />\nWe were on the boarding platform at 9:18, just in time to see<br />\nthe rear of the train disappear into the night. There wasn't another<br />\ntrain to Baltimore until 6 the<br />\nfollowing morning. The benches<br />\nin New Haven were a hell of a lot<br />\nmore comfortable.<br />\nI curl up, trying to find a soft<br />\nspot in the pine. My reminiscing<br />\nhas eaten up a few minutes. At a<br />\nquarter to twelve, a southbound<br />\ntrain roars into the station, shak-<br />\n<br />\ning the floor. I remember the old<br />\ndays, before Lisa and I were married, before she transferred from<br />\nProvidence. Each weekend<br />\ntogether was an oasis in a<br />\nsemester of drudgery, an oasis<br />\nthat is, except for the train rides.<br />\nI remember trying to squeeze<br />\nevery last second out of a<br />\nweekend, arriving in Baltimore at<br />\n7:45 and being in class to take an<br />\nexam by 8. Intro Chem tests are<br />\na bitch to study for at four in the<br />\nmorning while stuffed into a baggage compartment, with overhead lights flickering as the train<br />\nsways. I remember the time I<br />\nslept through my stop, made the<br />\nconductor stop the train, then<br />\nwalked a mile back along the<br />\ntracks. I remember the long, low,<br />\nlonely whistle as the train left a<br />\nstation and the scratchy of the intercom: \"Balamaw next, Penn<br />\nStation.\"<br />\nPenn Station. Here I am again.<br />\nDonna and Lisa are chatting<br />\nfuriously. I look at the schedule.<br />\nThe Night Owl is now listed as<br />\none hour late. The lights are<br />\nbright. I throw my arm over my<br />\neyes and shift a bit on the bench.<br />\nDonna is discussing a train's sexual symbolism. It sounds interesting, but my eyes, my ears,<br />\nmy brain, just won't cooperate<br />\nwith my curiosity. I fall asleep.<br />\nI am awakened by machine gun<br />\nfire. No, It's only the electronic<br />\nschedule, clack-clacking a new<br />\nmessage. Numbers shift and<br />\nflash, announcing that the Night<br />\nOwl is now two hours late. A collective groan comes from the station. The peasants revolt. Angry<br />\npassengers-to-be descend on the<br />\ndoughnut from all corners of the<br />\nSee LEE, 11<br />\n<br />\nWith Eyes Closed<br />\n<br />\nOddity at Hopkins<br />\nbizzare peculiarities that simply<br />\ndefy any attempts at explanation.<br />\nWe here at Hopkins have been<br />\ntaught to believe that everything in<br />\nthe world is normal, usual, and<br />\ncompletely conventional. Well, I<br />\nam here to show you the light.<br />\nThings are not always what they<br />\nseem, and things that are what<br />\nthey seem are not always normal,<br />\neven if seen on a daily basis, here<br />\nor anywhere else.<br />\nThere are many oddball occurrances. For example, last week,<br />\nwhen I was at my job of Escort<br />\nVan Driver, cruising around<br />\nHopkins picking up people and<br />\ndropping them off, I actually (and<br />\nreally, I am not kidding you)<br />\nfound a student who was in actual<br />\nneed of a security escort! It was<br />\nnot a band of drunken lacrosse<br />\nplayers wanting a ride from P.J.'s<br />\nto CVP; it was not a guy with a<br />\nlot of books who wanted a ride'<br />\nfrom the MSE to Wolman (I kid<br />\nyou not\u2014this happens all the<br />\ntime); it was not one of the<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nDisregarding Facts<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOnce again the News-Letter's<br />\nstaff has demonstrated its careless<br />\nreporting and disregard for the<br />\nfacts as they have been relayed to<br />\nthem. In last week's issue, a couple of things were reported about<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica that simply are not true.<br />\nOne article stated that the Coalition has initiated $12 million in<br />\nlawsuits against the DU fraternity and three of its former<br />\nbrothers. However, the Coalition<br />\nhas no outstanding lawsuits<br />\nagainst anyone. As had been emphasized to the News-Letter staff<br />\npreviously, those lawsuits are<br />\nprivate civil suits filed by Patrick<br />\nBond and one other member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, who<br />\nwere both in the shanty at the time<br />\nthat it was fire-bombed a year and<br />\na half ago. The Coalition has absolutely no connection or interest<br />\nin these lawsuits.<br />\nThe second item to which I<br />\nrefer was found in a News-Letter<br />\neditorial last week. Despite a Letter to the Editor attempting to<br />\ncorrect the same mistake two<br />\nweeks before, the editorial again<br />\nremarked that the Coalition supported the bill giving Gilman Hall<br />\nlandmark status. Again, that<br />\nsimply is not true. The Coalition<br />\ndid not take any side on this issue.<br />\n<br />\nIts purpose at the meeting was<br />\nquite simple\u2014to relay factual information about some of<br />\nHopkins' past administrative<br />\npractices, both at Homewood and<br />\nin East Baltimore. We felt that<br />\nthis information may happen to be<br />\nrelevant to the issue the committee was regarding. After all, the<br />\nquality (or lack thereof) of<br />\nHopkins' administrative policies<br />\nmust surely be important.

They are<br />\n<br />\nbanging their Bibles at women<br />\nwho, if Christian or perhaps<br />\nfollowers of a religion at all,<br />\nmight not even consider abortion<br />\nin the first place. Consider the<br />\nwords of Jesus: \"I am the Way,<br />\nthe Truth, and the Life.- Jesus<br />\nalso said,\".the truth shall set you<br />\nfree.\" The only way to help<br />\nwomen make responsible decisions regarding abortion is to<br />\nbring them the message of Jesus<br />\nChrist, that is, the Truth. The<br />\nTruth speaks for itself' it will free<br />\nany woman to make the proper<br />\ndecision. Our first duty as Christians, then, is to evangelize so<br />\nthat everyone has heard the<br />\nGospel and can choose either to<br />\naccept or to deny it. Without a<br />\nperson first accepting Christ, we<br />\ncannot expect to change anyone's<br />\nmind with Biblical arguments.<br />\nEven though the Christian protestors are doing an inept job,<br />\nthey are still fulfilling an important role, as they are offering a<br />\nmoral perspective on abortion<br />\nthat Planned Parenthood doesn't<br />\noffer. In contrast, the escorts are<br />\ncreating a role for themselves that<br />\nwould better be left to security<br />\npersonnel. The potential clients<br />\ndeserve to be shielded from<br />\nphysical harm, but not from information. All the escorts are doing is insulating the clients from<br />\nalternative ways of thinking. For<br />\npeople purporting to be prochoice, they are really proabortion because they are<br />\nshielding women from exploring<br />\nthe deeper moral questions that<br />\nabortion poses.<br />\n<br />\nstation.

I dream Lisa and I are<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to respond to the<br />\neditorial published in the October<br />\n9 issue of the News-Letter entitles, \"Focusing on Freedom,\"<br />\nin which the author attacks the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa<br />\nfor a variety of doings, one of<br />\nwhich involves the case of Terry<br />\nCorbett, the APL photojapher<br />\nwho refused to take picures of<br />\ndemonstrators at the Lab and was<br />\nsubsequently fired.<br />\nIn the aforementioned article,<br />\nthe author expresses confusion<br />\nover Mr. Corbett's continued<br />\nemployment at APL despite his<br />\nethical differences with the<br />\norganization. Granted, the reason<br />\nwhy Mr. Corbett stayed is<br />\nunclear, but that is not the point<br />\nI am attempting to make. What<br />\nthe article then went on to dictate<br />\nwas that security forces have the<br />\n\"right\" to photograph protestors<br />\nand that those demonstrators must<br />\naccept a loss of \"privacy\" in exchange for their protest.<br />\nSuch an opinion would have no<br />\nfallacy, were it true that security<br />\nforces never had links with local<br />\n<br />\nlaw enforcement agencies;<br />\nhowever, such organizations have<br />\nmaintained varying degrees of<br />\nconnection with police forces and<br />\ncontinue to do so, keeping the<br />\npossibility of discrimination due<br />\nto political belief very much<br />\nalive. One might argue, \"There's<br />\nnothing intrinsically wrong with<br />\nthe idea of photographing protestors.\" True, the process in and<br />\nof itself of photographing a<br />\ndemonstrator seems quite innocuous; but does one ever think<br />\nof what is done with the resulting<br />\n<br />\nTUITION, from 8<br />\nmost advanced levels, that the<br />\nprofessors which we are supposedly paying for teach very little indeed. A look in the course<br />\nguide will show that Professor<br />\nRobert Tucker, a scholar well<br />\nknown in the field of International<br />\nRelations, is listed as a joint<br />\nfaculty member at SAIS and<br />\nHomewood. Yet if one looks farther into the guide, one finds he<br />\nonly teaches at the graduate<br />\nschool of SAIS.<br />\nEducation at American provate<br />\nuniversities has become an extraordinarily expensive proposi-<br />\n<br />\npicture? What practical reason<br />\n(aside from discrimination) exists<br />\nfor keeping photographs of protestors? And if one does exist,<br />\nwhy doesn't APL explain it, instead of using the handy copout<br />\nanswer of \"security purposes?\"<br />\nFor the record. I am not (yet)<br />\naffiliated with the Coalition; I<br />\nmerely believe in expressing my<br />\noutrage at what I see as a violation of individual rights.<br />\nRichard White<br />\n<br />\ntion, especially when one looks at<br />\nthe caste to which Hopkins<br />\nbelongs. But the numbers don't<br />\nseem to add up at all to the expenses which Arts and Sciences<br />\nstudents are paying and as this<br />\ncolumn shall show in later weeks,<br />\nmany departments in this branch<br />\nof the university are not in the<br />\nbest of health to begin with. Arts<br />\nand Sciences majors are paying<br />\nfar too much and receiving far too<br />\nlittle, despite Hopkins hyperbole,<br />\nand relative to other schools in<br />\nthis price range one might question whether this school is worth<br />\n<br />\nBruce's Best Oddity<br />\n<br />\nBRUCE, from 9<br />\nthat, although it is loaded with and about five to six feet across<br />\nat Hopkins.

Do you like<br />\nthe major?<br />\nArellano: I love the department. I think it's a great<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nN-L: If you<br />\nchange<br />\nit at<br />\n_ could<br />\n_<br />\n_<br />\nall, would you, and how would<br />\nyou?<br />\nArellano: We have pretty good<br />\ncurriculum. The only thing we<br />\nneed right now is more faculty<br />\nmembers. In other words, you<br />\nknow there are courses that only<br />\nWS majors can take, because we<br />\ndon't have enough room, our<br />\nclasses are very small. We can't<br />\nhave classes with forty of fifty<br />\npeople. So we run out of room.<br />\nYou know, for instance, Steve<br />\nDixon teaches Rudiments of Fiction, and this year we have<br />\nanother section, because Tristan<br />\nis also doing Rudiments. Still, I<br />\nhave a waiting list of about 15<br />\npeople. However, if you look<br />\nback six, seven years, you'd be<br />\nsurprised how much we've been<br />\nadding to the department from the<br />\nfaculty point of view. I'll just give<br />\n<br />\nyou one example. We used to hire<br />\none teaching assistant, the one we<br />\nthought to be best. . . we would<br />\nhire that person to be on the faculty the next year. Now we hire<br />\ntwo. . .the faculty has doubled in<br />\nthe last seven years. We have<br />\nadded a lot of courses. All the<br />\njournalism courses are new. . .in<br />\nthe last five or six years. We've<br />\nadded in poetry, in fiction.<br />\nN-L: What do you do in your<br />\nspare time? Hobbies?<br />\nArellano: I read a lot.<br />\nN-L: Any particular subjects,<br />\nauthors?<br />\nArellano: Plays.<br />\nN-L: What playwrights do you<br />\nlike?<br />\nArellano: Albee, Tennessee<br />\nWilliams for sure. I'm not a very<br />\nbig fan of O'Neil.<br />\nN-L: Anything else?<br />\nArellano: I like to read a lot of<br />\nLatin American writers.<br />\nN-L: Like who?<br />\nArellano: Borges. . we had<br />\nhim here. . .he was great. It's<br />\nsomething new, something different. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is.<br />\nalso wild. I tried to get him to<br />\ncome here.<br />\nN-L: What happened?<br />\n<br />\nRichard A. Bell<br />\n<br />\nArellano: I have a niece who<br />\nlives in Washington (she's from<br />\nColombia). She knew the ambassador in Washington, who<br />\nknew the president of Colombia,<br />\nwho was a good friend of Marquez', who gave me his number<br />\nin Mexico City.<br />\nThe first time I called the maid<br />\nanswered, so I called again and<br />\ngot his wife. I invited them to<br />\ncome. She said, he'll never go to<br />\nthe States. I said, Oh? She said,<br />\nwhenever we want to go to the<br />\nStates they don't give us a visa.<br />\nN-L: Why?<br />\nArellano: Because they think<br />\nhe's a communist.<br />\nN-L: Do you think he's a<br />\ncommunist?<br />\nArellano: I don't think so. He's<br />\na good friend of Castro's and that<br />\nright away gets him in trouble.<br />\nN-L: In your Intermediate<br />\nPlaywriting course, it is a tradition to meet in your apartment<br />\nafterwards for the cast party. You<br />\nhave a considerable collection of<br />\naquariums with guppies.<br />\nArellano: It's an interest. It's<br />\nfor fun.

Ettle<br />\n\"Except for the weather, I'm<br />\ndefinitely pleased,\" said InterFraternity Council President<br />\nSteven Basta about last Sunday's<br />\nFall Fest, a day of free food and<br />\nmusic. The Fall Fest, which took<br />\nplace under rainy afternoon skies<br />\non the Gilman quad, was designed to keep students on campus<br />\nover the Fall Break weekend.<br />\nDespite poor attendance in the<br />\npast, Fall Fest I-987 was successful in attracting the student<br />\npopulation, predominantly upperclassmen, for various<br />\nreasons\u2014some of which had little to do with Fall Fest itself.<br />\nThe format of Fall Fest was the<br />\nmost influential factor in its success this year. Organizers of the<br />\nevent from the Hop,IFC and StuStudents enjoy themselves at the Fall Break Festival last weekend. Attendees ate, drank and listendent Council kept the afternoon<br />\ned to bands among other activities offered.<br />\ncompletely unstructured so that<br />\nstudents could come and go at<br />\ntheir leisure. \"We had to do<br />\nsomething for Fall Fest,\" said<br />\nStudent Council President Scott<br />\nFitzgerald, \"and this was the best<br />\nidea because people can come and<br />\ngo when they want without being<br />\nobligated to stay for certain<br />\nactivities.\"<br />\nThe casual format of Fall Fest,<br />\nhowever, was unsettling to certain freshmen used to the planned activities of Orientation.<br />\n\"Where are the activities?\" asked freshman Josh Putterman.<br />\n\"What's there to do besides stand<br />\nhere and freeze?\"<br />\nEarly afternoon rains and low<br />\ntemperatures discouraged some<br />\nstudents from attending the event.<br />\n<br />\n\"It's too cold for me,\" said<br />\nGabrielle Kirsch. \"I didn't feel<br />\nlike standing outside doing<br />\nnothing while I froze to death.\"<br />\nAs the skies cleared and<br />\ntemperatures rose later in the<br />\nafternoon, attendance did improve. \"A lot of people were in<br />\ndoubt as to whether this was going on or not with the weather<br />\nlike it is,\" said ATO brother Jeff<br />\nPerlstein. \"Since the weather has<br />\ncleared up though, more people<br />\nhave stopped by.\"<br />\nThe proximity of certain<br />\nreligious holidays had an indirect<br />\neffect on the attendance at the<br />\nevent. Said freshman Jonathan<br />\nKurtz, \"Many students have been<br />\naway for Rosh Hashana, Yom<br />\nKippur, and Succot which took<br />\nplace just this past week. Now a<br />\nlot of us want to be back here this<br />\nweekend to see our friends and to<br />\nsee Fall Fest.\" FitzGerald was<br />\nequally enthusiastic about the<br />\npopularity of the event. \"I know<br />\npeople who came back to the<br />\ncampus [on Saturday] just to see<br />\nthis,\" he said. \"A lot of people<br />\nwere really looking forward to<br />\nthis.\"<br />\nBasta was quick to add that the<br />\nworkload and upcoming midterms did not adversely affect the<br />\nturnout at Fall Fest. \"Students \u2022<br />\nmight just have easily gone home<br />\nto catch up on their work,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"They would have gone<br />\nhome too if it weren't for this.<br />\nFall Fest is designed to be a time<br />\nwhen students can relax and take<br />\na break from their work. I think<br />\na lot of students stayed here and<br />\ntook advantage of it.\"<br />\n<br />\nBent Goro<br />\n<br />\nStrange Desire<br />\nat the Grad Club<br />\nby Sharon Fischman<br />\nAfter weeks of waiting and<br />\nhoping, the Grad Club is finally<br />\nopening. With new, limited<br />\nhours, Monday through Friday,<br />\n9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., the club,<br />\nfeaturing Strange Desire, will<br />\ncelebrate it's grand opening on a<br />\ntrial basis.<br />\nThough organized slightly differently, the Grad Club will<br />\nbasically be the same as ever, offering a selection of food ranging<br />\nfrom gyros to pizzas, and beer,<br />\nwine, sodas and hot drinks. The<br />\nmenu was thanged this year to<br />\nallow only one pdtrson to serve<br />\nand cook at the same time. \u2022<br />\nThe late reopening and changes<br />\nin structure (such as only one person working at a time, and the<br />\nlimited hours) are due to past<br />\nfinancial difficulties. According<br />\nto financial coordinator for student activities Shelly Albrecht,<br />\nthe school is trying to avoid further losses of money.<br />\nPart of the new policy will include only allowing people over<br />\n21 in when bands are playing,<br />\nwhich Shelly hopes, will be most<br />\nFridays. Other days, though,<br />\nanyone will be admitted. Shelly<br />\n<br />\nstresses that this is not unfair,<br />\nsince the club is really aimed at<br />\ngraduate students. If the club is<br />\nto be successful, she says, it will<br />\nhave to be attended by graduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nShelly also plans, with<br />\nmanagers Norma Perez and Dan<br />\nDubelman, to have promotional<br />\nspecials, such as certain food<br />\nspecials during Monday night<br />\nfootball.<br />\nThe same old juke box and pinball machines grace the over<br />\n20-year-old establishment. Decor<br />\nstill consists of red and white<br />\nchecked tableclothes and heavy<br />\nwood booths. The same wild<br />\nmural covers the walls. Even the<br />\nprices are the same. For those<br />\nwho have spent much time there,<br />\nnothing will seem different, except that they will not be able to<br />\nbreak the world grad clubbing<br />\nrecord of spending every night<br />\nfor three weeks in there, since it<br />\nwon't be open on weekends.<br />\nIf you've never been to the<br />\nGrad Club, though, it's quite an<br />\nexperience.

Ifyou haven't heard the news,<br />\nlast week's quiz gave the quizlings a<br />\nchance to be creative and write a theme<br />\nsong for ourfine university. The entries<br />\nwere numerous, and the N2L Editors and<br />\nthe QM -himselffinally had something to<br />\nsing about.

The iconoclastic<br />\nCycle<br />\nnewsletter,<br />\nKillers,keeps members abreast<br />\nof club developments. The<br />\nClub still has a need for a<br />\nmasseuse. Any one interested<br />\nin this position should get in<br />\ntouch with Gurland.<br />\nThe vitality of the Club is a<br />\ntestament to its members enthusiasm. The original Bike<br />\nClub became defunct in 1984<br />\nafter a senior president<br />\nabsconded with the equipment. The dedication and<br />\nperserverence shown by<br />\nAnne-Marie Ulrich, Dan<br />\nNinigrin, and Aaron Davis in<br />\nthe fall of 1985 helped ressurrect a new cycling club. With<br />\nthe purchase of new equipment(and the establishment of<br />\na security ID system) club<br />\nmembership flourished. By the<br />\nspring of last year, weekend<br />\nrides that originally produced<br />\ntwo or three riders were attended by ten or more. At present, the Club's Saturday rides<br />\nare a pot-luck, with each<br />\ncyclist meeting another and<br />\ndeciding where they would<br />\nlike to go. On Sunday, maps<br />\ndetailing rides of approximately 10,20, and 35 miles are<br />\ndistributed and the riders split<br />\ninto groups.<br />\n\"It's difficult at times to<br />\nfind the perfect ride for<br />\neveryone,\" says Davis, \"but<br />\nwe try to see to it that no one<br />\ngets lost and that everyone has<br />\nfun.\"<br />\nWhen the weather gets chilly, club members still turn out<br />\nfor the twelve o'clock bell.<br />\nWith the same dogged dedication (or blatent stupidity)<br />\ndisplayed by the Crew Team<br />\nand their five a.m. sculling<br />\nsessions, Club members face<br />\nwind-chill factors that would<br />\nsend polar bears running for<br />\nshelter, rain that would make<br />\nNoah build a little bit faster,<br />\nand canines that would make<br />\nCujo look like a French Poodle. Complaints are never<br />\nheard though, just the hiss of<br />\n115 psi tires on very cold<br />\npavement.<br />\nAlthough the Club includes<br />\nmany tourists, its core is made<br />\nup of a few die-hard racers.<br />\nLast weekend at 6 a.m., as the<br />\nrest of the sane world slept,<br />\nHopkins Cycling Club<br />\nmembers were congregating at<br />\nMSE, shivering as they loaded their thoroughbreds onto<br />\ncar-racks. Hoping to cash in<br />\non all those weekend rides,<br />\nthey headed off for the Eastern<br />\nShore Velo Club Cycling<br />\nChampionship, a two day<br />\nstage race composed of a 32<br />\nmile road race on Saturday, a<br />\n6 mile time trial Sunday morning, and a 21 mile road race<br />\nSunday afternoon.<br />\nSaturday's race was five circuits of a six mile loop. The<br />\nmorning was cool, the road<br />\nrolling. Junior Kyu-Tae Lee<br />\nwas strong throughout the<br />\nrace, narrowly missing a few<br />\nprimes (pronounced preems),<br />\n<br />\nwhich are merchandise or<br />\npoint prizes given to the winner of a certain lap. Lee faced<br />\na strong sprinter in the final<br />\nlap, placing second in a photofinish. Senior Aaron Davis<br />\nfollowed Lee to take third<br />\nwhile senior Tim Reed took<br />\nsixth.<br />\nA time trial is a race against<br />\nthe clock, the so-called \"race<br />\nof truth.\" Sunday morning<br />\nReed covered the still-dewy<br />\ncourse in a blistering 14:23, a<br />\ntime which earned him second<br />\nplace for that stage. Davis<br />\nfinished fifth, a second behind<br />\nthe fourth place finisher. Lee<br />\nalso ran into some bad luck, as<br />\nhis chain snapped at the turnaround point, sending him into the brush alongside the<br />\nroad.<br />\nAll riders seemed to be<br />\nrecovered for the afternoon<br />\nrace, as the Hopkins sky-blue<br />\njersies never left the head of<br />\nthe pack. Reed set the pace for<br />\nmuch of the race, leaving<br />\nDavis to sprint for the finish,<br />\nwhere, as Lee had done the,<br />\nday earlier, he took second by<br />\nhalf a wheel. Lee crossed the<br />\nline in fourth place.<br />\nThe final results showed<br />\nDavis in third place overall,<br />\nand Lee in fourth. All in all,<br />\nthe team had three second<br />\nplace finishes, one third, one<br />\nfourth, and one fifth, a particularly strong showing for<br />\nthe team's initial race. Juniors<br />\nKendt Eckland and Jeff<br />\nGurland had respectable showings, as did somphomore Udai<br />\nKammula. Freshman Mark<br />\nRubin ran into an amourous<br />\nterrier in Sunday's last race,<br />\nbut escaped the incident<br />\nunscathed. All competitors enjoyed themselves, despite the<br />\nalmost two-hour commute to<br />\nthe Eastern Shore.<br />\n\"We'll definitely be stronger<br />\nin the spring,\" said Reed after<br />\nthe race. Coming up later this<br />\nmonth on the team's schedule<br />\nis the Tour of America<br />\nCriterium in College Park,<br />\nwhich will take place October<br />\n25. November will bring the<br />\nBobby Phillips Criterium at<br />\nLake Montebello, just a few<br />\nblocks past Memorial stadium.<br />\nThe bulk of racing, however,<br />\nwill take place in the spring.<br />\nThe team will participate in as<br />\nmany Eastern Collegiate Cycling Federation (which<br />\nHopkins is a part of)events as<br />\npossible. Races are held at<br />\nvarious campuses in the Northeast. The ECCF championships will be held in Vermont<br />\nat the end of the season.<br />\nWhether racing or just<br />\nhanging out, the Bike Club<br />\nholds true to its motto: It's better to look good than to be<br />\ngood.

This in itself might not be a<br />\nbad thing, but in this day and age,<br />\nemphasizing having sex with wild<br />\nabandon seems a bit stupid, considering all the stuff lurking out<br />\nthere.

It<br />\nintroduced Hopkins' newest comic talent, Howie Fried in a<br />\nhilarious play about breakdown<br />\nof communication. Written by the<br />\nabsurdist Eugene Ionesco, it was<br />\ndirected with abandoned humor<br />\nby Jennie Levy, and Joan Karr<br />\n(who last year co-directed the<br />\nfarce \" `Dentity Crisis\").

Blank and<br />\n<br />\nLindsay. Howie Fried heated up<br />\nthe stage, and when the audience<br />\nstarted responding to him, he ate<br />\nit up. Kurtz matched him on<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nseveral occasions, with his own<br />\naggressive comedy. The play was<br />\nincredibly funny, and wild.

At times<br />\nshe is undaunted and Herculean,<br />\nas Morrison describes her in the<br />\nbeginning of the story:<br />\n\"The one who never looked<br />\naway, who when a man got<br />\nstomped to death by a mare right<br />\nin front of Sawyer's restaurant<br />\ndid not look away; and when a<br />\nsow began eating her own litter<br />\ndid not look away then either.\"<br />\nYet Sethe's story is one of successive subordinations, to her<br />\nslave masters, to Paul D and then<br />\nto Beloved. Another contradiction: Sethe seems to harbor<br />\ntenderness and sentimentality, as<br />\nwhen she remembers her husband<br />\nand reflects lovingly back on the<br />\n\"men of Sweet Home.' Yet she<br />\nis capable of numbed, nihilistic<br />\nbehavior that seems to disregard<br />\nthe immediate presence of those<br />\naround her:<br />\n\"I couldn't let all that go back<br />\nto where it was, and I couldn't let<br />\nher nor any of them live under<br />\nschooteacher (slave master). That<br />\nwas out.\"<br />\nIn the grip of this reasoning,<br />\n<br />\nSethe sees fit to kill her daughter<br />\nBeloved, to prevent her recapture<br />\nand return to slavery.<br />\nAll of the characters in Beloved embody these same kind of<br />\nnettling contradictions. Paul D<br />\ncan be hard-boiled, as he is when<br />\nhe sets up shop at Sethe's place,<br />\nand he can also be restless and<br />\nsex-driven, as he is with both<br />\nSethe and Beloved. Denver appears always to be inseparable<br />\nfrom her mother, yet she<br />\nultimately sets off and leaves<br />\nSethe behind. Morrison's<br />\ncharacters are complex and<br />\nfascinating; as ex-slaves, yes, but<br />\nespecially as people.<br />\nNext to the richness of her<br />\ncharacters, the most impressive<br />\nfeature of Morrison's prose is her<br />\nweaving of metaphor into the narrative. Morrison describes the<br />\nrelationship developing betwen<br />\nDenver and Beloved:<br />\n\"Denver was seeing it and now<br />\nfeeling it\u2014through Beloved.<br />\nFeeling how it must have felt to<br />\nher mother. Seeing how it most<br />\nhave looked. And the more fine<br />\npoints she made, the more detail<br />\nshe provided, the more Beloved<br />\nliked it. So she anticipated the<br />\nquestions by giving blood to the<br />\nscraps her mother and grandmother had told her\u2014and a heart-,<br />\nbeat. The monologue became, in<br />\nfact, a duet as they lay down<br />\ntogether, Denver nursing Beloved's interest like a lover whose<br />\npleasure was to overfeed the<br />\nloved.\"<br />\nSuch heavy use of metaphor has<br />\na way of injecting un-reality into<br />\nthe story even at its most active<br />\nmoments.

It<br />\nwas their highest scoring game<br />\nthis year and according to the<br />\nBaltimore Sun it was their finest<br />\nperformance in three years.<br />\nThe defense played great as<br />\nwell.

Sean Bramble<br />\nOK, OK, I'll try this week to<br />\nstop venting my spleen at Edward<br />\nBennett Williams and instead<br />\nfocus on the business at hand,<br />\nnamely, the World Series. And,<br />\nfollowing the dictum of Martin<br />\nLuther to \"go and sin bravely, \u2022'<br />\nI shall fearlessly offer my World<br />\nSeries predictions.<br />\nActually, that would be<br />\n\"World Series prediction\" except for the fact that Whitey Herzog just wouldn't let the Giants<br />\nwin in time for me to write this.<br />\nSo I'll have to offer two sets of<br />\npredictions -- one for each NL<br />\nteam against the Minnesota<br />\nTigers. I mean the Detroit Twins.<br />\nWell, you know what I mean.<br />\nIt's just that I have difficulty<br />\nbelieving that the Minnesota<br />\nTwins have won the pennant. But<br />\nthey have. and I must admit they<br />\nhave earned the right to represent<br />\nthe ragtag AL West, as well as<br />\nthe Toronto Blue Jays, Detroit<br />\nTigers, Milwaukee Brewers, and<br />\nNew York Yankees, all of whom<br />\nfinished with better records than<br />\nthe Twins.<br />\nAnyway. to prepare my predictions I used the \"World Series<br />\nPrediction System\" invented by<br />\nBill James and presented in his<br />\n1984 Baseball Abstract. To keep<br />\n<br />\nthe explanations short, its a<br />\nseries of thirteen rules which,<br />\nwhen applied to post-season<br />\nmatch-ups, correctly identifies<br />\nthe winner 70 percent of the time.<br />\nThat means it's not foolproof, but<br />\nit's not your roommate's pick,<br />\neither. So I ran comparisons for<br />\nboth match-ups, and here's what<br />\nI got:<br />\n17-it'ins vs. Giants\u2014This promises to be an exciting matchup,<br />\nas these two teams are more<br />\nclosely matched than I might have<br />\nthought. Their offensive indicators are about even, but it's<br />\na dearth of second-line pitching<br />\nthat will probably doom the<br />\nTwins. I can just see Blyleven or<br />\nViola getting knocked out in the<br />\nthird and Tom Kelly turning<br />\nto. . . Les Straker? Joe Niekro?<br />\nMaybe it won't happen that<br />\nway, hut you have to remember<br />\nthat Kelly is relying upon three<br />\nproven pitchers (Viola, Blyleven,<br />\nand Reardon), plus the erratic fat<br />\nman (sorry. Juan). Anyway, the<br />\nsystem gives the Giants the edge.<br />\nand I would go ahead and pick the<br />\nGiants in seven.<br />\nTwins vs. Car(linals\u2014<br />\nAbsolutely no contest. The Cardinals are a terrific team from top<br />\nto bottom. They're having trouble beating the Giants because<br />\nthey're the kind of team the Cards<br />\n<br />\nwould have trouble defeating, but<br />\nif they make it to the World<br />\nSeries, they'll smear the Twins.<br />\nI mean, the Twins will be so far<br />\nout of their depth they'll need a<br />\nbathyscape to survive.<br />\nAnd if Clark comes hack, go<br />\nfor the Cards in four. Without<br />\nhim the Cardinals should still do<br />\nwell, and since the system picks<br />\nthe Cardinals to win handily, I'd<br />\ngo with the Redbirds in five.<br />\nA few notes: Did you know<br />\nthat before this year, Doyle Alexander's record in postseason play<br />\nwas 0-3<br />\nwith<br />\na 7.65<br />\nERA?. . .

According to the nowexistent policy, students may add or drop<br />\nclasses up until the eighth week of the<br />\nsemester.<br />\nThe proposed new policy would move<br />\nthe add deadline to the second week of the<br />\nsemester, and drop date would be moved<br />\nto the sixth week. This drastic change, supported by Associate Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences P. Kyle McCarter, was offered in<br />\nan attempt to keep some students from using the present system to control their grade<br />\npoint averages and reserving space in more<br />\nclasses than their schedules allow.<br />\nThe Council has developed a counterproposal in response to this. Although it is<br />\nonly a tentative one, this proposal offers an<br />\nadd deadline even later than the one<br />\npresently in effect. Council members<br />\nbelieve that their plan would be more effective than McCarter's because it would<br />\nallow students to fill the spaces left in certain classes after the final drop deadline.<br />\nWhile the Council's proposal needs some<br /><br />\nrefinements, its principle certainly addresses the needs of student more appropriately than McCarter's.<br />\nMany students attend classes unofficially until places become available; sometimes<br />\nthis is not until four or five weeks into the<br />\nsemester\u2014 often after the first midterm. A<br />\ntwo-week dealine is a restrictively early<br />\none. It would permanently close students<br />\nout of classes long before others had to drop<br />\nthem; by the same token, it would keep<br />\nstudents from dropping classes if they had<br />\nno possibility of adding other classes. In the<br />\nlong run, it would limit some of the flexibility students enjoy early in the year.<br />\nStudent Council President Scott FitzGerald encouraged students to attend next<br />\nWednesday's Council meeting and express<br />\ntheir opinions about McCarter's proposal.<br />\nIf the Council's overwhelming disapproval<br />\nof the plan is indicative of student opinions<br />\nin general, then we hope FitzGerald will<br />\nhave a solid turnout on Wednesday. It is<br />\nimperative that McCarter and the Administration hear the students' views before<br />\nthey make such a critical change in the<br />\nundergraduate program.<br /><br />\nA Look at Numbers<br />\nThe soon to be released U.S. News &amp;<br />\nWorld Report survey of college presidents<br />\nshows that Hopkins has been ranked sixteenth in its category, national universities.<br />\nThe ranking is surprisingly indicative of<br />\nHopkins. It suggests the good and the bad,<br />\nbut most of all it tries to correlate and quantify Hopkins' uniqueness.<br />\nWhile Hopkins is extremely wellrespected nationally in a number of fields,<br />\nthe criteria evaluated shed light on why the<br />\nranking is, in comparison to some of these<br />\nprograms, quite low. The college presidents<br />\nwere asked to take into consideration the<br />\ncohesiveness of the curriculum, the quality of teaching, the relationship between<br />\nfaculty and students, and the atmosphere<br />\nof learning fostered by the campus.<br />\nThese are the kinds of topics with which<br />\nHopkins undergrads are notoriously discontent. Regarding in particular the faculty's<br />\nconcern, manifested in time and attitude,<br />\nfor students, undergraduates have<br />\nsubstantial\u2014and valid\u2014complaints.<br />\nThe problems regarding faculty/student<br />\nrelationships and curriculum are being addressed. P. Kyle McCarter Jr., the<br />\nassociate dean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences, is responsible for an intensive<br /><br />\ndepartment self-evaluation to take place this<br />\nyear. Despite the apparent idealism of the<br />\nsuggestion, this quantified interpretation of<br />\nour performance in the given criteria might<br />\nprovide an impetus. Hopkins, by taking the<br />\nranking for various programs as seriously<br />\nas it does, might learn to take great pride<br />\nin any future escalation in the ranks.<br />\nThe ranking of sixteen falls in a range<br />\nthat reflects a dichotomy. Considering the<br />\nproblems in curriculum and student/faculty relations that are so apparent, the ranking is still quite high.<br />\nA somewhat legitimate response is that<br />\nHopkins is ranked so high because other institutions in its category face comparable<br />\nproblems and limitations. Although this<br />\nthought answers the question somewhat, it<br />\navoids Hopkins' attitude toward education.<br />\nHopkins' strength lies in its independent<br />\nstudy opportunities. Those opportunities,<br />\nincluding the ability to work on an individual basis with faculty starting freshman<br />\nyear, are by far more abundant than<br />\nstudents realize.<br />\nThe ranking, which is both high and yet<br />\nnot high enough, brings out the strengths<br />\nin Hopkins.

We were inundated<br />\nwith responses from last week's \"Gala<br />\nHopkins Theme Song Quiz,\" and our staff<br />\nhas spent the past three days singing along<br />\nto these wonderful tunes. We hope the rest<br />\nof the campus enjoys these lyrics as much<br />\nas we all did.<br />\nIt becomes obvious, upon reading these<br />\nsongs, that a common thread runs<br />\nthroughout most of them. Words like<br />\n\"geek,\" \"throat,\" and \"D-level\" appear<br />\ncontinuously. For some, it might be distur-<br /><br />\nbing that the most appropriate Hopkins<br />\ntheme focuses on our nerd-like atmosphere,<br />\nto coin a phrase. On the other hand, these<br />\nsongs may show that this reputation is really<br />\nno more than a joke, and that we all can<br />\nlaugh at ourselves every once in a while.<br />\nMost important, though, these songs are indicative of the sharp wit and, albeit, twisted<br />\nsense of school spirit alive at Hopkins<br />\ntoday.<br />\nA big thank-you goes to all those who<br />\ncontributed; to the rest of you<br />\ngeeks . . .happy singing!<br /><br />\nA big proposition:<br />\nIs it worth it?<br />\nJohns Hopkins is once again on<br />\nthe leading edge of a trend<br />\namongst prestigious American<br />\nuniversities, but not in a sense of<br />\nwhich she should be proud.<br />\nUndergraduate tuition is scandalously high at many universities, but if one is an Arts and<br />\nScience major here, the situation<br />\nis one of highway robbery.<br />\nFirst, the general trend.

But I just wish to mention<br />\na funny thing that happened this<br />\nafternoon. I was walking along,<br />\nminding by own business, when<br />\nI ran into Doug Warren from the<br />\nAlumni Relations Office. I was<br />\nintroduced to Doug three years<br />\nago by Jim, who was quite good<br />\nfriends with him. Doug stopped<br /><br />\nme and said, \"Bruce! You have<br />\ngot to stop mentioning Jim in<br />\nyour articles. Forget about<br />\nhim!!\" he said, as if to a Marine<br />\nwho has just seen his buddy slain.<br />\n\"He's gone!\" I have taken this<br />\nadvice to heart, and from now on<br />\nthe only Jim Clancy who I will<br />\never mention will be the pitcher<br />\nfor the Toronto Blue Jays.<br />\nNow we've gotten that taken<br />\ncare of once and for all, on to this<br />\nweek's column. There sure are<br />\nsome weird things here at<br />\nHopkins. There are some really<br /><br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\nSentimental Journey<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nCars I like, buses are okay, but<br />\ntrains I detest. They make me<br />\nfrustrated, angry, and worst of<br />\nall, mushy. It is eleven p.m., and<br />\nI am laying on a hard wooden<br />\nbench staring up at the roof of<br />\nPennsylvania Station. My wife<br />\nLisa sits beside me, and beside<br />\nher Donna, her best friend from<br />\nProvidence College. Donna has<br />\nbeen visiting over Fall Break, and<br />\nis to take the 11:04 Night Owl<br />\nback to Providence. The train is<br />\ndelayed.<br />\nI pull myself up to a sitting<br />\nposition. Donna walks to the<br />\ndoughnut shaped information<br />\nbooth and asks the Amtrak man<br />\njust how much of a delay is involved. Forty minutes, more or<br />\nless. Add twenty minutes to get<br />\nfrom DC to Baltimore, and the<br />\ntrain should arrive by 12:07.<br />\nSame old song and dance here.<br />\nHas a train ever been on time?<br />\nTwice, to my extensive<br />\nknowledge. My grandmother had<br />\njust been buried outside of<br />\nPoughkeepsie. Lisa and I had to<br />\ncatch a 9:17 back to Baltimore.<br />\nHer brother drove. We missed a<br />\nturn in New Haven.<br />\n\"Don't worry,\" I said, \"they<br />\nnever leave on time.\"<br />\nWe were on the boarding platform at 9:18, just in time to see<br />\nthe rear of the train disappear into the night. There wasn't another<br />\ntrain to Baltimore until 6 the<br />\nfollowing morning. The benches<br />\nin New Haven were a hell of a lot<br />\nmore comfortable.<br />\nI curl up, trying to find a soft<br />\nspot in the pine. My reminiscing<br />\nhas eaten up a few minutes. At a<br />\nquarter to twelve, a southbound<br />\ntrain roars into the station, shak-<br /><br />\ning the floor. I remember the old<br />\ndays, before Lisa and I were married, before she transferred from<br />\nProvidence. Each weekend<br />\ntogether was an oasis in a<br />\nsemester of drudgery, an oasis<br />\nthat is, except for the train rides.<br />\nI remember trying to squeeze<br />\nevery last second out of a<br />\nweekend, arriving in Baltimore at<br />\n7:45 and being in class to take an<br />\nexam by 8. Intro Chem tests are<br />\na bitch to study for at four in the<br />\nmorning while stuffed into a baggage compartment, with overhead lights flickering as the train<br />\nsways. I remember the time I<br />\nslept through my stop, made the<br />\nconductor stop the train, then<br />\nwalked a mile back along the<br />\ntracks. I remember the long, low,<br />\nlonely whistle as the train left a<br />\nstation and the scratchy of the intercom: \"Balamaw next, Penn<br />\nStation.\"<br />\nPenn Station. Here I am again.<br />\nDonna and Lisa are chatting<br />\nfuriously. I look at the schedule.<br />\nThe Night Owl is now listed as<br />\none hour late. The lights are<br />\nbright.

No, It's only the electronic<br />\nschedule, clack-clacking a new<br />\nmessage. Numbers shift and<br />\nflash, announcing that the Night<br />\nOwl is now two hours late. A collective groan comes from the station. The peasants revolt.

Well, I<br />\nam here to show you the light.<br />\nThings are not always what they<br />\nseem, and things that are what<br />\nthey seem are not always normal,<br />\neven if seen on a daily basis, here<br />\nor anywhere else.<br />\nThere are many oddball occurrances. For example, last week,<br />\nwhen I was at my job of Escort<br />\nVan Driver, cruising around<br />\nHopkins picking up people and<br />\ndropping them off, I actually (and<br />\nreally, I am not kidding you)<br />\nfound a student who was in actual<br />\nneed of a security escort! It was<br />\nnot a band of drunken lacrosse<br />\nplayers wanting a ride from P.J.'s<br />\nto CVP; it was not a guy with a<br />\nlot of books who wanted a ride'<br />\nfrom the MSE to Wolman (I kid<br />\nyou not\u2014this happens all the<br />\ntime); it was not one of the<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nDisregarding Facts<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOnce again the News-Letter's<br />\nstaff has demonstrated its careless<br />\nreporting and disregard for the<br />\nfacts as they have been relayed to<br />\nthem. In last week's issue, a couple of things were reported about<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica that simply are not true.<br />\nOne article stated that the Coalition has initiated $12 million in<br />\nlawsuits against the DU fraternity and three of its former<br />\nbrothers. However, the Coalition<br />\nhas no outstanding lawsuits<br />\nagainst anyone. As had been emphasized to the News-Letter staff<br />\npreviously, those lawsuits are<br />\nprivate civil suits filed by Patrick<br />\nBond and one other member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, who<br />\nwere both in the shanty at the time<br />\nthat it was fire-bombed a year and<br />\na half ago. The Coalition has absolutely no connection or interest<br />\nin these lawsuits.<br />\nThe second item to which I<br />\nrefer was found in a News-Letter<br />\neditorial last week. Despite a Letter to the Editor attempting to<br />\ncorrect the same mistake two<br />\nweeks before, the editorial again<br />\nremarked that the Coalition supported the bill giving Gilman Hall<br />\nlandmark status. Again, that<br />\nsimply is not true. The Coalition<br />\ndid not take any side on this issue.<br /><br />\nIts purpose at the meeting was<br />\nquite simple\u2014to relay factual information about some of<br />\nHopkins' past administrative<br />\npractices, both at Homewood and<br />\nin East Baltimore. We felt that<br />\nthis information may happen to be<br />\nrelevant to the issue the committee was regarding. After all, the<br />\nquality (or lack thereof) of<br />\nHopkins' administrative policies<br />\nmust surely be important. Also.<br />\nI find it interesting that the<br />\neditorial deemed the Coalition's<br />\narguments \"weak at best\"<br />\nwithout criticizing anything<br />\nspecific. Surely, you can do better than that.<br />\nFinally, I would like to add that<br />\nlast week I was told by a NewsLetter staffer that my letter could<br />\nnot exceed 300 words. Yet in last<br />\nweek's issue, Mr. Gitlitz was<br />\nprovided ample space to comment<br />\nin at least twice as many. Could<br />\nthere be some subtle censorship<br />\ngoing on, based on political<br />\ncontent?<br />\nDavid M.

They are<br /><br />\nbanging their Bibles at women<br />\nwho, if Christian or perhaps<br />\nfollowers of a religion at all,<br />\nmight not even consider abortion<br />\nin the first place. Consider the<br />\nwords of Jesus: \"I am the Way,<br />\nthe Truth, and the Life.- Jesus<br />\nalso said,\".the truth shall set you<br />\nfree.\" The only way to help<br />\nwomen make responsible decisions regarding abortion is to<br />\nbring them the message of Jesus<br />\nChrist, that is, the Truth. The<br />\nTruth speaks for itself' it will free<br />\nany woman to make the proper<br />\ndecision. Our first duty as Christians, then, is to evangelize so<br />\nthat everyone has heard the<br />\nGospel and can choose either to<br />\naccept or to deny it. Without a<br />\nperson first accepting Christ, we<br />\ncannot expect to change anyone's<br />\nmind with Biblical arguments.<br />\nEven though the Christian protestors are doing an inept job,<br />\nthey are still fulfilling an important role, as they are offering a<br />\nmoral perspective on abortion<br />\nthat Planned Parenthood doesn't<br />\noffer. In contrast, the escorts are<br />\ncreating a role for themselves that<br />\nwould better be left to security<br />\npersonnel. The potential clients<br />\ndeserve to be shielded from<br />\nphysical harm, but not from information. All the escorts are doing is insulating the clients from<br />\nalternative ways of thinking. For<br />\npeople purporting to be prochoice, they are really proabortion because they are<br />\nshielding women from exploring<br />\nthe deeper moral questions that<br />\nabortion poses.<br /><br />\nstation.

I dream Lisa and I are<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to respond to the<br />\neditorial published in the October<br />\n9 issue of the News-Letter entitles, \"Focusing on Freedom,\"<br />\nin which the author attacks the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa<br />\nfor a variety of doings, one of<br />\nwhich involves the case of Terry<br />\nCorbett, the APL photojapher<br />\nwho refused to take picures of<br />\ndemonstrators at the Lab and was<br />\nsubsequently fired.<br />\nIn the aforementioned article,<br />\nthe author expresses confusion<br />\nover Mr. Corbett's continued<br />\nemployment at APL despite his<br />\nethical differences with the<br />\norganization. Granted, the reason<br />\nwhy Mr. Corbett stayed is<br />\nunclear, but that is not the point<br />\nI am attempting to make. What<br />\nthe article then went on to dictate<br />\nwas that security forces have the<br />\n\"right\" to photograph protestors<br />\nand that those demonstrators must<br />\naccept a loss of \"privacy\" in exchange for their protest.<br />\nSuch an opinion would have no<br />\nfallacy, were it true that security<br />\nforces never had links with local<br /><br />\nlaw enforcement agencies;<br />\nhowever, such organizations have<br />\nmaintained varying degrees of<br />\nconnection with police forces and<br />\ncontinue to do so, keeping the<br />\npossibility of discrimination due<br />\nto political belief very much<br />\nalive. One might argue, \"There's<br />\nnothing intrinsically wrong with<br />\nthe idea of photographing protestors.\" True, the process in and<br />\nof itself of photographing a<br />\ndemonstrator seems quite innocuous; but does one ever think<br />\nof what is done with the resulting<br /><br />\nTUITION, from 8<br />\nmost advanced levels, that the<br />\nprofessors which we are supposedly paying for teach very little indeed. A look in the course<br />\nguide will show that Professor<br />\nRobert Tucker, a scholar well<br />\nknown in the field of International<br />\nRelations, is listed as a joint<br />\nfaculty member at SAIS and<br />\nHomewood. Yet if one looks farther into the guide, one finds he<br />\nonly teaches at the graduate<br />\nschool of SAIS.<br />\nEducation at American provate<br />\nuniversities has become an extraordinarily expensive proposi-<br /><br />\npicture? What practical reason<br />\n(aside from discrimination) exists<br />\nfor keeping photographs of protestors? And if one does exist,<br />\nwhy doesn't APL explain it, instead of using the handy copout<br />\nanswer of \"security purposes?\"<br />\nFor the record. I am not (yet)<br />\naffiliated with the Coalition; I<br />\nmerely believe in expressing my<br />\noutrage at what I see as a violation of individual rights.<br />\nRichard White<br /><br />\ntion, especially when one looks at<br />\nthe caste to which Hopkins<br />\nbelongs. But the numbers don't<br />\nseem to add up at all to the expenses which Arts and Sciences<br />\nstudents are paying and as this<br />\ncolumn shall show in later weeks,<br />\nmany departments in this branch<br />\nof the university are not in the<br />\nbest of health to begin with. Arts<br />\nand Sciences majors are paying<br />\nfar too much and receiving far too<br />\nlittle, despite Hopkins hyperbole,<br />\nand relative to other schools in<br />\nthis price range one might question whether this school is worth<br /><br />\nBruce's Best Oddity<br /><br />\nBRUCE, from 9<br />\nthat, although it is loaded with and about five to six feet across<br />\nat Hopkins.

I was very pro- Castro at the time, because I was<br />\nvery much against Batista who<br />\nwas a dictator of the right. By July 11959] he [Castro] had picked\u2022<br />\na president, but he ran the country. Then he disagreed with the<br />\npresident, and kicked him out. I .<br />\nthought, that's not the way to do<br />\nthings. That's when I started getting suspicious of Communism,<br />\nand I said, if this is going to be<br />\nit. .I can't live here.<br />\nN-L: What did you do in Cuba<br />\nfor a living?<br />\nArellano: My father owned a<br />\ncompany that sold refrigerators.<br />\nWe imported refrigerators, and<br />\nsold them all over the island. My<br />\nfather owned the company, so I<br />\nwas vice-president.<br />\nN-L: What was your initial.<br />\nreactions when you came to the<br />\nU.S.?<br />\nArellano: I had been in school \u2022<br />\nhere . . .so the easiest thing for me .<br />\nto do was to work in the chemistry department since I had \u2022<br />\nmy degree in chemistry. . .so I<br />\nstarted working. But, I had .<br />\nalways enjoyed writing. There \u2022<br />\nwas the Writing Seminars here, and I could take courses. . .1 got<br />\nmy Master's degree in 1962.<br />\nN-L: What did you do in the.<br />\nperiod between your Masters in \u2022<br />\nChemistry and your Masters in<br />\nWriting?<br /><br />\nArellano: I worked in the Orgo<br />\nLab for a year, and then when \u2022<br />\nthey opened the Intermediate \u2022<br />\nOrganic Lab\u2014then I moved to<br />\nthat, and then I ran that lab.<br />\nN-L: Was there something in 4<br />\nthe subject that caused you to give it up, or was it something more<br />\nin the subject of writing?<br />\nArellano: As I said, I enjoyed<br />\nwriting,then I got the degree. . . it<br />\nwas back in 1970, I think.. .there<br />\nwas one student who wanted to do<br />\nsomething in playwriting, and<br />\nthere was no one to teach it, so<br />\nI said, all right. . .I'll teach a<br />\ncourse if it's all right with the<br />\nWriting Seminars, and they gave<br />\nme the okay.<br />\nN-L: So at this point you were<br />\nteaching in both departments?<br />\nArellano: Yes, but I was doing<br />\nthe playwriting for free.<br />\nN-L: When did you finally drop<br />\nchemistry?<br />\nArellano: Well, it wasn't that<br />\neasy. Eventually it was too much<br />\nwork, so I said, well, why don't<br />\nI have a dual appointment? I had<br />\na dual appointment! It started in<br />\n1971 and this went on for many<br />\nyears, but when John Irwin asked me (six or seven years ago) if<br />\nI vanted to be here full time, I<br />\nsaid, yes. It's not that I don't like<br />\nchemistry. It's just that this was<br />\nmore likeable. Chemistry is a bit<br />\nof a routine kind of job.

The only thing we<br />\nneed right now is more faculty<br />\nmembers. In other words, you<br />\nknow there are courses that only<br />\nWS majors can take, because we<br />\ndon't have enough room, our<br />\nclasses are very small.

Still, I<br />\nhave a waiting list of about 15<br />\npeople. However, if you look<br />\nback six, seven years, you'd be<br />\nsurprised how much we've been<br />\nadding to the department from the<br />\nfaculty point of view. I'll just give<br /><br />\nyou one example.

Ettle<br />\n\"Except for the weather, I'm<br />\ndefinitely pleased,\" said InterFraternity Council President<br />\nSteven Basta about last Sunday's<br />\nFall Fest, a day of free food and<br />\nmusic. The Fall Fest, which took<br />\nplace under rainy afternoon skies<br />\non the Gilman quad, was designed to keep students on campus<br />\nover the Fall Break weekend.<br />\nDespite poor attendance in the<br />\npast, Fall Fest I-987 was successful in attracting the student<br />\npopulation, predominantly upperclassmen, for various<br />\nreasons\u2014some of which had little to do with Fall Fest itself.<br />\nThe format of Fall Fest was the<br />\nmost influential factor in its success this year. Organizers of the<br />\nevent from the Hop,IFC and StuStudents enjoy themselves at the Fall Break Festival last weekend. Attendees ate, drank and listendent Council kept the afternoon<br />\ned to bands among other activities offered.<br />\ncompletely unstructured so that<br />\nstudents could come and go at<br />\ntheir leisure. \"We had to do<br />\nsomething for Fall Fest,\" said<br />\nStudent Council President Scott<br />\nFitzgerald, \"and this was the best<br />\nidea because people can come and<br />\ngo when they want without being<br />\nobligated to stay for certain<br />\nactivities.\"<br />\nThe casual format of Fall Fest,<br />\nhowever, was unsettling to certain freshmen used to the planned activities of Orientation.<br />\n\"Where are the activities?\" asked freshman Josh Putterman.<br />\n\"What's there to do besides stand<br />\nhere and freeze?\"<br />\nEarly afternoon rains and low<br />\ntemperatures discouraged some<br />\nstudents from attending the event.<br /><br />\n\"It's too cold for me,\" said<br />\nGabrielle Kirsch. \"I didn't feel<br />\nlike standing outside doing<br />\nnothing while I froze to death.\"<br />\nAs the skies cleared and<br />\ntemperatures rose later in the<br />\nafternoon, attendance did improve. \"A lot of people were in<br />\ndoubt as to whether this was going on or not with the weather<br />\nlike it is,\" said ATO brother Jeff<br />\nPerlstein. \"Since the weather has<br />\ncleared up though, more people<br />\nhave stopped by.\"<br />\nThe proximity of certain<br />\nreligious holidays had an indirect<br />\neffect on the attendance at the<br />\nevent. Said freshman Jonathan<br />\nKurtz, \"Many students have been<br />\naway for Rosh Hashana, Yom<br />\nKippur, and Succot which took<br />\nplace just this past week. Now a<br />\nlot of us want to be back here this<br />\nweekend to see our friends and to<br />\nsee Fall Fest.\" FitzGerald was<br />\nequally enthusiastic about the<br />\npopularity of the event. \"I know<br />\npeople who came back to the<br />\ncampus [on Saturday] just to see<br />\nthis,\" he said. \"A lot of people<br />\nwere really looking forward to<br />\nthis.\"<br />\nBasta was quick to add that the<br />\nworkload and upcoming midterms did not adversely affect the<br />\nturnout at Fall Fest. \"Students \u2022<br />\nmight just have easily gone home<br />\nto catch up on their work,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"They would have gone<br />\nhome too if it weren't for this.<br />\nFall Fest is designed to be a time<br />\nwhen students can relax and take<br />\na break from their work. I think<br />\na lot of students stayed here and<br />\ntook advantage of it.\"<br /><br />\nBent Goro<br /><br />\nStrange Desire<br />\nat the Grad Club<br />\nby Sharon Fischman<br />\nAfter weeks of waiting and<br />\nhoping, the Grad Club is finally<br />\nopening. With new, limited<br />\nhours, Monday through Friday,<br />\n9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., the club,<br />\nfeaturing Strange Desire, will<br />\ncelebrate it's grand opening on a<br />\ntrial basis.<br />\nThough organized slightly differently, the Grad Club will<br />\nbasically be the same as ever, offering a selection of food ranging<br />\nfrom gyros to pizzas, and beer,<br />\nwine, sodas and hot drinks. The<br />\nmenu was thanged this year to<br />\nallow only one pdtrson to serve<br />\nand cook at the same time. \u2022<br />\nThe late reopening and changes<br />\nin structure (such as only one person working at a time, and the<br />\nlimited hours) are due to past<br />\nfinancial difficulties. According<br />\nto financial coordinator for student activities Shelly Albrecht,<br />\nthe school is trying to avoid further losses of money.<br />\nPart of the new policy will include only allowing people over<br />\n21 in when bands are playing,<br />\nwhich Shelly hopes, will be most<br />\nFridays. Other days, though,<br />\nanyone will be admitted. Shelly<br /><br />\nstresses that this is not unfair,<br />\nsince the club is really aimed at<br />\ngraduate students. If the club is<br />\nto be successful, she says, it will<br />\nhave to be attended by graduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nShelly also plans, with<br />\nmanagers Norma Perez and Dan<br />\nDubelman, to have promotional<br />\nspecials, such as certain food<br />\nspecials during Monday night<br />\nfootball.<br />\nThe same old juke box and pinball machines grace the over<br />\n20-year-old establishment.

The iconoclastic<br />\nCycle<br />\nnewsletter,<br />\nKillers,keeps members abreast<br />\nof club developments. The<br />\nClub still has a need for a<br />\nmasseuse. Any one interested<br />\nin this position should get in<br />\ntouch with Gurland.<br />\nThe vitality of the Club is a<br />\ntestament to its members enthusiasm. The original Bike<br />\nClub became defunct in 1984<br />\nafter a senior president<br />\nabsconded with the equipment. The dedication and<br />\nperserverence shown by<br />\nAnne-Marie Ulrich, Dan<br />\nNinigrin, and Aaron Davis in<br />\nthe fall of 1985 helped ressurrect a new cycling club. With<br />\nthe purchase of new equipment(and the establishment of<br />\na security ID system) club<br />\nmembership flourished. By the<br />\nspring of last year, weekend<br />\nrides that originally produced<br />\ntwo or three riders were attended by ten or more. At present, the Club's Saturday rides<br />\nare a pot-luck, with each<br />\ncyclist meeting another and<br />\ndeciding where they would<br />\nlike to go. On Sunday, maps<br />\ndetailing rides of approximately 10,20, and 35 miles are<br />\ndistributed and the riders split<br />\ninto groups.<br />\n\"It's difficult at times to<br />\nfind the perfect ride for<br />\neveryone,\" says Davis, \"but<br />\nwe try to see to it that no one<br />\ngets lost and that everyone has<br />\nfun.\"<br />\nWhen the weather gets chilly, club members still turn out<br />\nfor the twelve o'clock bell.<br />\nWith the same dogged dedication (or blatent stupidity)<br />\ndisplayed by the Crew Team<br />\nand their five a.m. sculling<br />\nsessions, Club members face<br />\nwind-chill factors that would<br />\nsend polar bears running for<br />\nshelter, rain that would make<br />\nNoah build a little bit faster,<br />\nand canines that would make<br />\nCujo look like a French Poodle. Complaints are never<br />\nheard though, just the hiss of<br />\n115 psi tires on very cold<br />\npavement.<br />\nAlthough the Club includes<br />\nmany tourists, its core is made<br />\nup of a few die-hard racers.<br />\nLast weekend at 6 a.m., as the<br />\nrest of the sane world slept,<br />\nHopkins Cycling Club<br />\nmembers were congregating at<br />\nMSE, shivering as they loaded their thoroughbreds onto<br />\ncar-racks. Hoping to cash in<br />\non all those weekend rides,<br />\nthey headed off for the Eastern<br />\nShore Velo Club Cycling<br />\nChampionship, a two day<br />\nstage race composed of a 32<br />\nmile road race on Saturday, a<br />\n6 mile time trial Sunday morning, and a 21 mile road race<br />\nSunday afternoon.<br />\nSaturday's race was five circuits of a six mile loop. The<br />\nmorning was cool, the road<br />\nrolling. Junior Kyu-Tae Lee<br />\nwas strong throughout the<br />\nrace, narrowly missing a few<br />\nprimes (pronounced preems),<br /><br />\nwhich are merchandise or<br />\npoint prizes given to the winner of a certain lap. Lee faced<br />\na strong sprinter in the final<br />\nlap, placing second in a photofinish. Senior Aaron Davis<br />\nfollowed Lee to take third<br />\nwhile senior Tim Reed took<br />\nsixth.<br />\nA time trial is a race against<br />\nthe clock, the so-called \"race<br />\nof truth.\" Sunday morning<br />\nReed covered the still-dewy<br />\ncourse in a blistering 14:23, a<br />\ntime which earned him second<br />\nplace for that stage. Davis<br />\nfinished fifth, a second behind<br />\nthe fourth place finisher. Lee<br />\nalso ran into some bad luck, as<br />\nhis chain snapped at the turnaround point, sending him into the brush alongside the<br />\nroad.<br />\nAll riders seemed to be<br />\nrecovered for the afternoon<br />\nrace, as the Hopkins sky-blue<br />\njersies never left the head of<br />\nthe pack. Reed set the pace for<br />\nmuch of the race, leaving<br />\nDavis to sprint for the finish,<br />\nwhere, as Lee had done the,<br />\nday earlier, he took second by<br />\nhalf a wheel. Lee crossed the<br />\nline in fourth place.<br />\nThe final results showed<br />\nDavis in third place overall,<br />\nand Lee in fourth. All in all,<br />\nthe team had three second<br />\nplace finishes, one third, one<br />\nfourth, and one fifth, a particularly strong showing for<br />\nthe team's initial race. Juniors<br />\nKendt Eckland and Jeff<br />\nGurland had respectable showings, as did somphomore Udai<br />\nKammula. Freshman Mark<br />\nRubin ran into an amourous<br />\nterrier in Sunday's last race,<br />\nbut escaped the incident<br />\nunscathed.

So, this week we have a<br />\ntwo-part column: First I ramble,<br />\nthen we have tag-team reviewing<br />\nfrom two of our other staffers.<br />\nOne of the albums I received to<br />\nreview was the latest from<br />\nSamantha Fox, the British topless<br />\nmodel turned pop star. A quick<br />\nlisten revealed nothing new\u2014she<br />\nstill has no talent. In fact, judging from the sleeve photos and<br />\nher lyrical choices(\"I Can't Get<br />\nNo Satisfaction,\" etc.), it has<br />\nbecome quite obvious that the only thing selling this girl is her sex,<br />\nwhich she flaunts quite openly.<br />\nNow, this is the nature of the<br />\nbeast\u2014most girl groups have sold<br />\nmore on their sex than their talent<br />\n(yes, there are exceptions), but<br />\nthis makes me wonder if maybe<br />\nor Tipper doesn't have a point<br />\nabout that demon rock-and-roll.<br />\nBy selling themselves like this,<br />\nfemale rockers give a very skewed image to female sexuality.<br />\nNow, I have never considered<br />\nmyself a feminist, but I do find<br />\nthis is degrading to women. We<br />\nfind ourselves casting women into<br />\na mold created by these performers, and we expect them to<br /><br />\nlive up to these expectations\u2014we<br />\nwant hot nymphos, and that's<br />\nwhat we expect.<br />\nOkay, point two: I don't<br />\nbelieve for a minute that rockand-roll carbonates hormones any<br />\nmore than a good-looking<br />\nmember of the opposite sex, but<br />\nperformers of this type sure do<br />\nput a lot of emphasis on the sex<br />\nact. This in itself might not be a<br />\nbad thing, but in this day and age,<br />\nemphasizing having sex with wild<br />\nabandon seems a bit stupid, considering all the stuff lurking out<br />\nthere. It would be stupid for performers to start writing songs<br />\nabout using condoms, but they<br />\nshould, like any responsible artist, take a few minutes to consider what they're saying.<br />\nAs for Samantha Fox and her<br />\nilk, I can only conjecture that<br />\nthey've decided to say something<br />\nblatently adolescent, and more<br />\nthan a little stupid.<br />\nOkay, now here's Jay and<br />\nCo./With the info/on some folks<br />\nthey know./Take it away.

Another contradiction: Sethe seems to harbor<br />\ntenderness and sentimentality, as<br />\nwhen she remembers her husband<br />\nand reflects lovingly back on the<br />\n\"men of Sweet Home.' Yet she<br />\nis capable of numbed, nihilistic<br />\nbehavior that seems to disregard<br />\nthe immediate presence of those<br />\naround her:<br />\n\"I couldn't let all that go back<br />\nto where it was, and I couldn't let<br />\nher nor any of them live under<br />\nschooteacher (slave master). That<br />\nwas out.\"<br />\nIn the grip of this reasoning,<br /><br />\nSethe sees fit to kill her daughter<br />\nBeloved, to prevent her recapture<br />\nand return to slavery.<br />\nAll of the characters in Beloved embody these same kind of<br />\nnettling contradictions. Paul D<br />\ncan be hard-boiled, as he is when<br />\nhe sets up shop at Sethe's place,<br />\nand he can also be restless and<br />\nsex-driven, as he is with both<br />\nSethe and Beloved. Denver appears always to be inseparable<br />\nfrom her mother, yet she<br />\nultimately sets off and leaves<br />\nSethe behind. Morrison's<br />\ncharacters are complex and<br />\nfascinating; as ex-slaves, yes, but<br />\nespecially as people.<br />\nNext to the richness of her<br />\ncharacters, the most impressive<br />\nfeature of Morrison's prose is her<br />\nweaving of metaphor into the narrative. Morrison describes the<br />\nrelationship developing betwen<br />\nDenver and Beloved:<br />\n\"Denver was seeing it and now<br />\nfeeling it\u2014through Beloved.<br />\nFeeling how it must have felt to<br />\nher mother. Seeing how it most<br />\nhave looked. And the more fine<br />\npoints she made, the more detail<br />\nshe provided, the more Beloved<br />\nliked it. So she anticipated the<br />\nquestions by giving blood to the<br />\nscraps her mother and grandmother had told her\u2014and a heart-,<br />\nbeat. The monologue became, in<br />\nfact, a duet as they lay down<br />\ntogether, Denver nursing Beloved's interest like a lover whose<br />\npleasure was to overfeed the<br />\nloved.\"<br />\nSuch heavy use of metaphor has<br />\na way of injecting un-reality into<br />\nthe story even at its most active<br />\nmoments.

Sean Bramble<br />\nOK, OK, I'll try this week to<br />\nstop venting my spleen at Edward<br />\nBennett Williams and instead<br />\nfocus on the business at hand,<br />\nnamely, the World Series. And,<br />\nfollowing the dictum of Martin<br />\nLuther to \"go and sin bravely, \u2022'<br />\nI shall fearlessly offer my World<br />\nSeries predictions.<br />\nActually, that would be<br />\n\"World Series prediction\" except for the fact that Whitey Herzog just wouldn't let the Giants<br />\nwin in time for me to write this.<br />\nSo I'll have to offer two sets of<br />\npredictions -- one for each NL<br />\nteam against the Minnesota<br />\nTigers. I mean the Detroit Twins.<br />\nWell, you know what I mean.<br />\nIt's just that I have difficulty<br />\nbelieving that the Minnesota<br />\nTwins have won the pennant. But<br />\nthey have. and I must admit they<br />\nhave earned the right to represent<br />\nthe ragtag AL West, as well as<br />\nthe Toronto Blue Jays, Detroit<br />\nTigers, Milwaukee Brewers, and<br />\nNew York Yankees, all of whom<br />\nfinished with better records than<br />\nthe Twins.<br />\nAnyway. to prepare my predictions I used the \"World Series<br />\nPrediction System\" invented by<br />\nBill James and presented in his<br />\n1984 Baseball Abstract. To keep<br /><br />\nthe explanations short, its a<br />\nseries of thirteen rules which,<br />\nwhen applied to post-season<br />\nmatch-ups, correctly identifies<br />\nthe winner 70 percent of the time.<br />\nThat means it's not foolproof, but<br />\nit's not your roommate's pick,<br />\neither. So I ran comparisons for<br />\nboth match-ups, and here's what<br />\nI got:<br />\n17-it'ins vs. Giants\u2014This promises to be an exciting matchup,<br />\nas these two teams are more<br />\nclosely matched than I might have<br />\nthought. Their offensive indicators are about even, but it's<br />\na dearth of second-line pitching<br />\nthat will probably doom the<br />\nTwins. I can just see Blyleven or<br />\nViola getting knocked out in the<br />\nthird and Tom Kelly turning<br />\nto. . . Les Straker? Joe Niekro?<br />\nMaybe it won't happen that<br />\nway, hut you have to remember<br />\nthat Kelly is relying upon three<br />\nproven pitchers (Viola, Blyleven,<br />\nand Reardon), plus the erratic fat<br />\nman (sorry. Juan). Anyway, the<br />\nsystem gives the Giants the edge.<br />\nand I would go ahead and pick the<br />\nGiants in seven.<br />\nTwins vs. Car(linals\u2014<br />\nAbsolutely no contest. The Cardinals are a terrific team from top<br />\nto bottom. They're having trouble beating the Giants because<br />\nthey're the kind of team the Cards<br /><br />\nwould have trouble defeating, but<br />\nif they make it to the World<br />\nSeries, they'll smear the Twins.<br />\nI mean, the Twins will be so far<br />\nout of their depth they'll need a<br />\nbathyscape to survive.<br />\nAnd if Clark comes hack, go<br />\nfor the Cards in four. Without<br />\nhim the Cardinals should still do<br />\nwell, and since the system picks<br />\nthe Cardinals to win handily, I'd<br />\ngo with the Redbirds in five.<br />\nA few notes: Did you know<br />\nthat before this year, Doyle Alexander's record in postseason play<br />\nwas 0-3<br />\nwith<br />\na 7.65<br />\nERA?. . .
