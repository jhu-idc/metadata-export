He was fifty years<br />\nold.<br />\nCiccarone had a brilliant<br />\ncoaching career at Hopkins,<br />\nposting a 105-16 win-loss record<br />\nover nine seasons.

He retired after the<br />\nlosing the 1983 championship<br />\ngame to Syracuse by a score of<br />\n17-16.

Ambassador uncertain<br />\nover future U.S. foreign policy<br />\nby Anne Langley<br />\nDid President Ronald Reagan<br />\ndo a good job in the area of<br />\nforeign relations? What is the current status and direction of EastWest and West-West relations?<br />\nWhat are Soviet Premier Mikhail<br />\nGorbachev's goals and underlying intentions in his overtures<br />\ntoward better relations with thL<br />\nUnited States and with other<br />\ncountries? Ambassador Eigil<br />\nJorgensen, Danish ambassador to<br />\nthe U.S., spoke briefly about<br />\nthese issues when he addressed a<br />\nModel United Nations meeting on<br />\nTuesday.<br />\nTo begin, Jorgensen said,<br />\n\"relations between the U.S. and<br />\nEurope have been excellent under<br />\nReagan,\" and he expressed his<br />\nhope that the Bush Administration<br />\nwill continue many of the policies<br />\nthat have been established.<br />\nForeign policy, he said, is<br />\nentering a very important phase,<br />\nwith a challenging future ahead.<br />\n\"We are in a transition period,\"<br />\nsaid Jorgensen. \"There is a 'certain uncertainty' concerning EastWest and West-West relations.\"<br />\nGorbachev's efforts, begun in<br />\n1985, marked the beginning of a<br />\nnew era. This new era holds great<br />\npromise, said Jorgensen, but, at<br />\nthe same time, relations have<br />\nbecome less predictable.<br />\nRelations other than those with<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. are changing as<br />\nwell. Specifically, Jorgensen saw<br />\na new kind of relationship<br />\ndeveloping between the U.S. and<br />\nEurope. \"Europe is no longer a<br />\n<br />\ncountry on its knees,\" he said.<br />\n\"...The Europe of 1946 no<br />\nlonger exists.\" To accomodate<br />\nthese changing needs and attitudes, strong waves of reform<br />\nare altering the economy, defense<br />\nspending, and North Atlantic<br />\nTreaty Organization relations in<br />\nEurope.<br />\nOne of the most significant of<br />\nthese changes will be the integrated market, or common<br />\nmarket, to be formally adopted in<br />\n1992. Major questions exist<br />\nregarding the widespread impact<br />\nof this new European market,<br />\nmany of which cannot be fully<br />\nanswered until the market is in<br />\nplace.<br />\nJorgensen said the market will<br />\nbe a challenge to the U.S., but<br />\nthat this challenge is manageable<br />\nand in the long run will be<br />\nbeneficial. The Common Market<br />\n(EEC) will lead to a \"European<br />\npillar\" economically, estaban<br />\nas<br />\nEurope<br />\nlishing<br />\neconomic equal. In regard to<br />\nDenmark in particular, Jorgensen<br />\nexpressed concern that current industries are not competitive and<br />\nthat the Common Market will<br />\nfoster competition.<br />\nAnother issue of concern to the<br />\nU.S. and Europe is relations with<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. According to<br />\nJorgensen, \"U.S.S.R. relations<br />\nare no longer dominated by the<br />\nrigid policy of the Kremlin. There<br />\nare many reforms [in the hands<br />\nof Gorbachev], but no one knows<br />\nat this point where they will<br />\nlead.\"<br />\nHe added that the U.S.S.R. has<br />\n<br />\nbeen much more flexible about<br />\nresolving conflicts. In the area of<br />\ndefense, the U.S.S.R. has stated<br />\nthat it wants to change its policy<br />\nto a purely defensive one, but so<br />\nfar no concrete action has been<br />\ntaken.<br />\nIn economic terms, the<br />\nU.S.S.R. has seen it in its own interest to improve its economic<br />\nsituation. Jorgensen said, \"We<br />\nbelieve it is in the West's interest<br />\nto help [them].\" Europe has<br />\nrecently agreed to lend the<br />\nU.S.S.R. $9 billion in accordance<br />\nwith this belief.<br />\nJorgensen expressed the idea<br />\nthat Europe is generally less<br />\nideological and more pragmatic<br />\nwhen it comes to relations with<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. Despite specific<br />\npolicy action differences,<br />\nhowever, Europe fully agrees<br />\nwith the U.S. overall in regard to<br />\nrelations with the Soviet Union.<br />\nJorgensen assessed the relationship between the U.S. and<br />\nEurope as \"healthy and good.\"<br />\nDisagreements on specifics are a<br />\nsign of health, and adjustments<br />\nare on the way. That is true for<br />\nEurope internally as well. Denmark's own needs are well served by the development of the<br />\nEuropean Community and the<br />\nchanges in NATO.<br />\nJorgensen expressed hope that<br />\nthe ties between Europe and the<br />\nU.S. will be strengthened even<br />\nfurther. \"The historic bonds of<br />\nfriendship between the U.S. and<br />\nEurope are unabated,\" he said.<br />\n\"We could not do without each<br />\nother.\"<br />\n<br />\nUnder proposed Seals rules,<br />\nSAC would still play key role<br />\nSEALS from 4<br />\nExec Board would not try to<br />\ndetermine which students have<br />\ncontributed to that activity.<br />\nSophomore Jonathan Roberts,<br />\nanother Exec Board member, explained, \"We feel qualified to<br />\njudge groups, not individuals.\"<br />\nThe following are potential examples of how such analysis<br />\nmight work:<br />\na) The Young College<br />\nModerates, an SAC group with<br />\nfifty members, requests an allotment of four Seals. The Exec<br />\nBoard determines that the group<br />\ndoes not deserve many Seals<br />\nbecause of its few demonstrable<br />\nactivities, but may deserve more<br />\nthan one Seal because of its high<br />\nmembership.<br />\nb) The Left-Right Centrists, an<br />\nSAC group with ten members, requests four Seals. The Exec<br />\nBoard determines that the group<br />\nhas sponsored many lectures and<br />\nhas held frequent debates on<br />\nmany issues.

This<br />\nvote is the only numerical data the<br />\nExec Board has from the approximately seventy groups there and<br />\nthousands of student participants.<br />\nBamforth, Student Council<br />\nPresident and Exec Board<br />\nmember Lou Giangiulio, and<br />\nRoberts were surprised at the<br />\n<br />\nCAMPUS CRIME<br />\nLarceny<br />\n\u2022Between October 30 and 31,<br />\nsomeone removed a vacuum<br />\ncleaner from a custodial closet<br />\nin the Athletic Center.

Questions of<br />\nacademic ethics are brought<br />\nbefore the board, investigated and<br />\nreviewed, and appropriate action<br />\nis taken. An honor code, if found<br />\nfeasible and if supported by the<br />\nstudents, would take the place of<br />\nthe Ethics Board.<br />\nThe Student Council Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee on the Honor Code is<br />\nexamining the possibility of instituting an honor code at<br />\nHopkins. A sixty-year honor code<br />\nhere was dissolved in 1975 at the<br />\nrequest of the students.<br />\nOmbudsman Sigmund Suskind,<br />\nArts and Sciences dean at the time<br />\nof the dissolution, noted a general<br />\nfeeling that the students could not<br />\ncontrol the level of cheating, and<br />\nthat the honor code and the honor<br />\nboard were not functioning properly. The students wanted help<br />\nfrom the administration and<br />\nfaculty in addressing questions of<br />\nethics.<br />\nThe honor code was discontinued with a promise from<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller that students should feel<br />\nfree to petition to reinstate it at<br />\nany time.<br />\nAn honor code places the immediate burden of an ethicallysound academic atmosphere on<br />\nthe shoulders of the students. It<br />\nwould require students to turn in<br />\noffenders, permit unproctored exams, require students to sign an<br />\nhonor pledge, and, upon infraction, to face a trial by peers.<br />\nFaculty would have a distinct<br />\nbut less prominent role in helping to create this atmosphere.<br />\nTheir obligation would be to do<br />\neverything possible to make the<br />\nconditions of a class fair and<br />\nequal for all students. They, too,<br />\nwould report infractions and use<br />\nthe honor court to determine guilt<br />\nand punish offenders.<br />\nLast year's honor code committee, which thought an honor<br />\ncode desirable, submitted a report<br />\non the issue in April. The report<br />\nincluded a general description of<br />\nthe honor code and an outline of<br />\nthe major problems involved with<br />\nimplementation.<br />\nEducation Committee Chair<br />\nJeff DeCagna, a member of the<br />\ncommittee, said one of the biggest<br />\nquestions facing such a committee is the problem of implementation: \"Because of the keen<br />\ncompetition, it is difficult to enforce an honor code,\" he said.<br />\nThe report outlined a tentative<br />\nplan for the pursuit of an effective honor code.<br />\nThe first stages of this plan<br />\nhave begun, as a new committee<br />\nunder Chairman Jeremy Klausner<br />\ngot under way. Posters encouraging students to think about<br />\ncheating have appeared around<br />\ncampus. According to Klausner,<br />\nthese posters are meant to<br />\ngenerate awareness and discussion and represent the first step<br />\ntowards the education of the<br />\nSee HONOR, 7<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/7<br />\n<br />\nBME honor code remains<br />\nsubordinate to Ethics Board<br />\nHONOR, from 6<br />\nHopkins community about the<br />\nissue.<br />\nKlausner said the next step for<br />\nthe committee is to look closely<br />\nat the other schools' honor codes<br />\nand come up with a semester-bysemester plan of attack. \"We<br />\ncan't really move from not having an honor code to having one<br />\nin one step,\" he said. \"It is a problem of integration and education<br />\nabout the issue.\"<br />\nInterest in an honor code is not<br />\nlimited to the committee and Student Council. The Department of<br />\nBiomedical Engineering is implementing its own departmental<br />\nhonor code. The code, written by<br />\nthree students at the end of last<br />\nyear, has undergone many revisions and is now in the final<br />\nstages of approval. It will probably be in place by next<br />\nsemester.<br />\nEric Young, BME undergraduate coordinator, has been<br />\nworking with the students in<br />\nestablishing this code. The code<br />\nincludes some of the same principles being considered by the Ad<br />\nHoc Honor Code Committee, but<br />\nis limited by requirements of the<br />\nEthics Board.<br />\nSince it applies to only one<br />\ndepartment, the code must be<br />\nconsistent with current policy and<br />\nfall under Ethics Board jurisdiction. Young emphasized that the<br />\nBME code was studentmotivated, but saw definite faculty support and involvement.<br />\n\"Some faculty members have<br />\nbeen unhappy about violations in<br />\nthe last couple of years. . . We expect the students to behave in an<br />\nethical fashion,\" he said.<br />\nA major question facing BME<br />\nand the honor code committee is<br />\nthe compatibility of such a departmental honor code with the<br />\ndevelopment of a University-wide<br />\nhonor code.<br />\nKlausner is apprehensive about<br />\nthe BME code: \"I think it's going to create problems,\" he said.<br />\n\"It creates a division among the<br />\nHopkins community in regard to<br />\nethics.\"<br />\nYoung does not share this<br />\nview. \"The BME honor code<br />\nwould be no impediment to a<br />\nUniversity-wide honor code,\" he<br />\nsaid. A university code would<br />\noverride the BME code.\"<br />\nAlex Kemper, a member of the<br />\nBME society working to implement the code, also saw no interference.

He said strongly, \"No<br />\nwarhead research is taking<br />\nplace.\" He said funding for the<br />\nlab was about $350 million annually, this budget \"separate but<br />\nequal\" to that of the other divisions' budgets.<br />\nCochran has said earlier that<br />\n\"we don't deal with nuclear<br />\nwarheads or ballistics.

Hopkins is<br />\nplacing the priority of building<br />\nweapons of destruction over<br />\naiding the homeless and others.<br />\nWhat kind of priorities are<br />\nthose?\"<br />\nThese controversies seemed to<br />\nforeshadow similarly controversial incidents involving APL. One<br />\ninvolved industrial photographer<br />\nTerry Corbett, who asked not to<br />\nbe connected in any way with any<br />\nof the other persons mentioned in<br />\nthis article.<br />\nHe had worked in Defense for<br />\nnine years before coming to<br />\nHopkins because of a \"consolidation of operations.\" He responded to an advertisement calling for<br />\npersons to photograph equipment<br />\nSee APL, 9<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/9<br />\n<br />\n. . . but protesters decry APL's<br />\nalleged military connections<br />\nAPL, from 8<br />\nand devices for Hopkins journals<br />\nand the Department of Defense.<br />\nThen he discovered that he was<br />\nalso being asked to photograph<br />\ndemonstrators against the APL<br />\nfor court purposes.<br />\nHe told his superiors, \"This<br />\nisn't in my job description.\" Six<br />\nmonths later, a new supervisor<br />\nentered his department and issued<br />\na written reprimand that suggested Corbett's actions were<br />\nsomehow' detrimental to society.\" When Corbett approached<br />\nthe personnel department, he was<br />\noffered the ultimatum of either<br />\nphotographing protesters or finding work elsewhere since \"no<br />\nfurther jobs are available here.\"<br />\nHe indicated that he had never<br />\ntaken any photographs of protesters, but others had, and<br />\n\"posters were made with the<br />\nfaces and names of all the protesters in 1987; twenty-five<br />\ncopies were made of each face,<br />\nto be mailed to the Pentagon.\"<br />\nAnother incident involved two<br />\nmembers of Jonah House, Dale<br />\nAshera-Davis and John Heid, and<br />\na Hopkins graduate student,<br />\nRichard Kramer. These three<br />\nissued a statement of their opinions in the News Letter opinion<br />\nsection entitled, \"The DODJHU-APL Triangle.\" They saw<br />\nno need to further explain their<br />\nposition.<br />\nAccording to them, many<br />\ngroups are actively involved in<br />\nworking to change APL for more<br />\n<br />\nhumanitarian research: among<br />\nothers, the Physicians for Social<br />\nResponsibility, the Howard<br />\nCounty SANE, VIVA [the<br />\nCatholic Worker], Atlantic Life<br />\nCommunity, Citizens Against the<br />\nPershing and Cruise Missiles, and<br />\nthe Independent Project for Conversion of the APL.<br />\nThey indicated that their actions were open and had to be interpreted in the light of past<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nIn October 1986, they presented University President<br />\nSteven Muller and an APL official with a \"cornucopia\" of toy<br />\nweapons to represent \"the gifts<br />\nthey were giving to the world.\"<br />\nMuller also received a papiermache turkey.<br />\nIronically, he later proceeded<br />\nto display this turkey as a<br />\n\"trophy,\" potentially suggesting<br />\nthat he did not take the situation<br />\nall that seriously, the protesters<br />\ncontended. The trio likened that<br />\nto \"hanging up a bloody knife.\"<br />\nIn November, they wanted to<br />\npour human blood on this turkey<br />\nas part of their \"Bread Not<br />\nBombs\" demonstration.<br />\nAfter a complicated series of<br />\nevents, Ashera-Davis and<br />\nKramer entered Muller's office<br />\nbut were unable to locate the<br />\nturkey. Heid accompanied them<br />\nto distract Muller's secretaries.<br />\nThey produced a facsimile of the<br />\nturkey, placed it in a metal tray,<br />\nand proceeded to pour blood on<br />\nit, as well as on other items on the<br />\ndesk.<br />\n<br />\n\"This is just like the protesters<br />\nwho put homemade napalm on<br />\ndraft-cards because they thought<br />\nthey were hunting licenses,\" said<br />\nHeid. He suggested \"if they were<br />\nletters or documents about<br />\nDefense, then the blood was symbolically already on them.\"<br />\nThe group had expected the<br />\npresence of the press or at least<br />\nsome evidence that it was concerned and had contacted the<br />\nUniversity. No such evidence<br />\nwas present, suggested AsheraDavis, because \"there are ties<br />\nbetween Hopkins and the<br />\nBaltimore Sun. Hopkins practically owns this town.\"<br />\nShe cited as evidence the attorneys who, after the group's arrest, could not represent them<br />\nbecause of conflict of interest<br />\narising from legal work done on<br />\nthe University's behalf.<br />\n\"The trial involved some blatant misinformation, because<br />\nHopkins placed the damage<br />\nestimate at about $3,500, and<br />\nlater lowered this by about<br />\n$1,000 after we contested it,\"<br />\nthey said.<br />\nThe first prosecutor had to drop<br />\nthe case on reasons of personal<br />\nconscience since he was a fundamentalist Christian and \"felt<br />\nthat we were basically decent<br />\npeople even if he couldn't agree<br />\nwith us.\" During the trial, he<br />\nsupposedly tried to subpoena<br />\nMuller, but Muller refused to appear since he did not feel he<br />\nwould need to appear as a<br />\nmaterial witness, said the<br />\n<br />\n1111<br />\nWHILE ITS HOT<br />\n<br />\nThe APL Chain of Command<br />\n<br />\nORGANIZATION CHART<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nBOARD OF TRUSTEES<br />\nCOMMITTEE ON THE APPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT<br />\nAdv,sory Board<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY<br />\nDIRECTOR<br />\nASSOCIATE DIRECTOR<br />\nDirector of Personnel<br />\nProgram Offices<br />\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR, Researcb<br />\nand Exploratory Development<br />\n\u2014 Laboratory Counsel<br />\nBiomedical Programs\u2014<br />\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR,<br />\n\u2014 Director of APL Education Center<br />\nLaboratory Operations<br />\nWarfare Systems Architecture \u2014<br />\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR,<br />\nand Engineering Office<br />\n\u2014 Chile Scientist<br />\nBusiness Operations<br />\nCONTROLLER<br />\n<br />\nAERONAUTICS<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br />\n<br />\nRESEARCH<br />\nCENTER<br />\n<br />\nNAVAL<br />\nWARFARE<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br />\n<br />\nSPACE<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br />\n<br />\nFLEET SYSTEMS<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br />\n<br />\nBUSINESS<br />\nSYSTEMS<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br />\n<br />\nTECHNICAL<br />\nSERVICES<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br />\n<br />\nPervonnel<br />\n& Education<br />\nBrand'<br />\n<br />\nprotesters.<br />\nThe statute that the trio violated<br />\ncarries a possibility of three<br />\nyears' imprisonment.

The<br />\ncode would place the primary burden of<br />\nmaintaining an ethical academic atmosphere on the students; we would be<br />\nresponsiblefor reporting infractions ofthe<br />\ncode. Offenders wouldface a trial by peers.<br />\nAn honor code would replace the Ethics<br />\nBoard, consisting of both faculty and<br />\nstudents, which currently monitors ethical<br />\n<br />\nstandards at Hopkins.<br />\nThe moral questions surrounding a<br />\npotential honor code are difficult ones.<br />\nCheating, in particular, is difficult to<br />\ndefine, and variesfrom class to class. And<br />\nyet, under a code, a student would be expected to control cheating as he saw it with<br />\n\"less prominent\" input from the faculty.<br />\nThe following editorial, taken from the<br />\nDecember 9, 1983 News-Letter, only<br />\nbegins to demonstrate the complexity and<br />\ntimelessness of this issue.<br />\n<br />\n\"The professor once gave out blue books<br />\nthat were shorter than the ones they sell in<br />\nthe bookstore.\"<br />\n\"Really?\"<br />\nIt was pretty funny. The next day, at the<br />\nbeginning of lecture, he stood at the front<br />\nof the room with the blue books piled in<br />\na stack. And then he did it.\"<br />\n\"Did what?\"<br />\n\"He stood them up on the desk, took out<br />\nthe longer ones, and called out the names.\"<br />\n\"What happened to them?\"<br />\n\"I don't know.\"<br />\n\"You're lying.\"<br />\n\"No, I'm not.\"<br />\n\"Since when do professors care if<br />\nstudents cheat? I've seen plenty of people<br />\ncheat, and the profesoor or the TA just sits<br />\nthere reading a newspaper or something.\"<br />\n\"What kind of cheating are you talking<br />\nabout?\"<br />\n\"What do you mean what kind? I thought<br />\nthere's only one kind.\"<br />\n\"There's more than one. What you're<br />\ntalking about is the dependent type. You<br />\nsee, there are two kinds. Dependent and independent, dependent probably being more<br />\ncommon.\"<br />\n\"Dependent, independent. What the<br />\nhell's your problem?\"<br />\n\"Are you familiar with Mole Cell<br />\nexams?\"<br />\n\"What about them?\"<br />\n\"Part of the class takes the exam in Mudd<br />\nwhile the other part takes it in Remsen.\"<br />\n\"So?\"<br />\n\"A few weeks ago, before a Mole Cell<br />\nexam, a few TA's walked over to a student<br />\nin Mudd and escorted him out.\"<br />\n\"Why?\"<br />\n\"He was supposed to be in Remsen.\"<br />\n\"And you think he was in Mudd because<br />\nhe was going to cheat off someone?\"<br />\n\"I'm not saying a word.\"<br />\n\"But how'd the TA's know he was in<br />\n<br />\nMudd?\"<br />\n\"Some students must have told them. Let<br />\nme put it another way. I think some students<br />\nwere seeing him get away with it too<br />\noften.\"<br />\n\"Did anything happen to him?\"<br />\n\"I don't know. But the professor came<br />\ninto Mudd before the exam and told<br />\neveryone to make sure their books were<br />\nbelow their desks. It was ironic in a way.<br />\nA couple days before, he said some TV station wanted to film the class while they<br />\nwere taking the exam. But he told them that<br />\nthe exam was more than enough for the<br />\nstudents to worry about. God, that<br />\nwould've been funny. Having that whole<br />\nscene appearing on TV for all of Baltimore<br />\nto see.\"<br />\n\"So that's dependent cheating then?\"<br />\n\"It could've been. Anyone who uses<br />\nanyone else to improve an exam grade is<br />\ncheating dependently.\"<br />\n\"Does that also include the case where<br />\nthe relationship is not agreed upon before<br />\nthe exam?\"<br />\n\"Yes.\"<br />\n\"So what's independent cheating?\"<br />\n\"Exactly what it says. Let's say someone's taking a calc exam. He brings in<br />\na blue book and on the last page is a bunch<br />\nof formulae. He uses them during the exam, but before he walks out of the room,<br />\nhe rips out the last page and the TA doesn't<br />\nknow the difference. But that's the dumb<br />\nway. It's much better just to stick a piece<br />\nof paper in the back of the blue book and<br />\ntake it out after the exam. You should try<br />\nit some time. Blue book exams could be a<br />\nlot of fun.\"<br />\n\"What?\"<br />\n\"Sure. Sometimes independent cheating<br />\ncan be more challenging than taking the exam. But that seldom happens.

LiCata's comments on the paid parking system<br />\nwith interest. I offer one important clarification. Parking<br />\nrevenues do not provide cash<br />\nflow for Arts and Sciences. The<br />\nfunds generated by parking fees<br />\nare used to off-set the costs of<br />\npaving, equipping, lighting, and<br />\nmanaging the parking areas. It<br />\nwould be a mistake for anyone to<br />\nthink that the University\u2014let<br />\nalone the Classics Department\u2014is<br />\nmaking money on paid parking.<br />\nEugene S.

Thirdly, since the<br />\ninformation in our specific applications contained mostly ideas,<br />\nand not facts, since we had not yet<br />\nbeen chosen, a potentially damaging situation to Fair could have<br />\ndeveloped if we were misquoted,<br />\nquoted out of context, or even if<br />\nwe had carelessly written the applications (by carelessly, we<br />\nmean written the applications<br />\nwithout considering the fact that<br />\nwhat we wrote might be printed).<br />\nWe feel very strongly that this incident shows extreme carelessness on the part of the Council<br />\nmember who gave out applications out and careless reporting<br />\non the part of the News-Letter.<br />\nBeth Friedman<br />\nLisa Weisbord<br />\nThe writers are 1989 Spring Fair<br />\nchairmen.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe article in last week's NewsLetter on Spring Fair 1989 was a<br />\nvery well-written and informative<br />\narticle, for which we thank Jon<br />\nStempel. However, the methods<br />\nhe used to gain information for<br />\nthis article were somewhat questionable. Instead of interviewing<br />\nus, the newly-appointed chairmen<br />\nof Spring Fair, the author of the<br />\narticle chose instead to walk into<br />\nthe Student Council Office and<br />\nrequest our applications from the<br />\nperson sitting there. The Student<br />\nCouncil member in the office at<br />\nthat time chose to hand them right<br />\nover to Jon. This incident alarmed us for several reasons. One, if<br />\nCouncil's policy is that the applications of people applying for<br />\nvarious positions are available to<br />\nthe public and particularly to the<br />\nNews-Letter, then the applicants<br />\nshould certainly be made aware<br />\nof that fact prior to turning in any<br />\napplication, or the application<br />\nitself should have a note to that<br />\neffect.

Due to the<br />\ndissemination of literature and<br />\nother information, however, the<br />\npopularity of study abroad programs has increased significantly. Last year a total of fifty \"Hoppies\" were scattered about the<br />\nglobe.<br />\nSince University policy does<br />\nnot strictly designate approval to<br />\nonly certain programs, students<br />\nare allowed much latitude when<br />\nselecting<br />\ncourse.<br />\na<br />\n\"It's about discovery,\" states<br />\nDr. Evans. \"The selection of a<br />\nprogram requires self-examination<br />\ntion of one's goals, and the programs can also play a fundamental role in shaping a career.\"<br />\nThe growth in the number of<br />\nstudents abroad provided senior<br />\nAlex Parikh, who studied abroad<br />\nduring his junior year, with the<br />\nidea of generating a group to ac-<br />\n<br />\ncomplish three main goals. The<br />\nfirst is to reach out to those interested in study abroad programs, the second is to provide<br />\nsupport for returning students,<br />\nand the last is to keep in contact<br />\nwith those who are temporarily<br />\naway from the Hopkins community. The Study Abroad<br />\nForum, as the group is called, is<br />\nsponsored by Academic Advising<br />\nbut is largely student-run.<br />\n\"I would like to see it student<br />\nrun in order to meet the need of<br />\nthe students,\" said Dr. Evans.<br />\nSome of the immediate aims of<br />\nthe group are to compile a directory of returning students and to<br />\npublish a \"how to\" booklet with<br />\nhelpful hints to those going<br />\nabroad. In order to keep in contact with students currently out of<br />\nthe country, the group also plans<br />\nto mail out News-Letter snapshots of life at Hopkins. _<br />\nAnother benefit of the Forum<br />\nhas been the creation of weekly<br />\ngroup meetings with Dr. Evans<br />\nand a returning Hopkins student<br />\nfor those who are interested in ex-<br />\n<br />\nEly Brown<br />\n<br />\nSenior Alex Parikh, who studied abroad last year, conceived the Study Abroad Forum<br />\nto provide students<br />\nwith help in pursuing their academics overseas.<br />\nploring the possibility of foreign<br />\nstudy. Scheduled on Tuesday<br />\nafternoons at 3:30 p.m. and Friday mornings at 10:00 a.m., the<br />\nmeetings provide interaction with<br />\na student experienced in selecting<br />\na suitable program.<br />\nDiane Fernbach, a senior returning from a Parliamentary internship in London, eagerly recommends study abroad. She also<br />\nsaid that the Study Abroad Forum<br />\n\"brings students together in order<br />\nto share their experiences.\"<br />\nAfter sitting in on one of the<br />\ngroup sessions, interested<br />\nstudents have three other<br />\n<br />\nreference sources available to<br />\nthem in Academic Advising: collected pamphlets from various<br />\nprograms, independent references that work with these programs listed by country, and<br />\nquestionnaires completed by students who have returned.<br />\nOnce a student has chosen prospective programs, applied, and<br />\nreceived acceptances, the student<br />\nthen decides which program is<br />\nmost conducive to fulfilling his<br />\nidentified goals. After completing<br />\nthe necessary paperwork and conferring with a faculty advisor, the<br />\nstudent is granted a leave of<br />\n<br />\nabsence by the University. Application deadlines for the spring<br />\nsemester usually fall in October<br />\nand November, while the<br />\ndeadlines for most programs<br />\nbeginning in the fall semester are<br />\nin March.<br />\nDesigned as a service for<br />\nstudents<br />\ninterested<br />\nin<br />\nforeign study, the Study Abroad<br />\nForum is a source of invaluable<br />\ninformation.

Most of the<br />\nchanges director William Foeller<br />\nhas chosen for his production are<br />\nin the set and the staging of the<br />\nplay. and while these alterations<br />\nare innovative and at times<br />\nenlightening, they are a serious<br />\nand potentially dangerous departure from Shepard's carefully<br />\nwoven fabric of dialogue and<br />\nstage directions.<br />\nThe battle between director and<br />\nplaywright\u2014which one has the<br />\nfinal word\u2014dates way back. But<br />\nin most of Shepard's older plays,<br />\nsuch as Fool for Love, it is important to question why the stage<br />\ndirections are so detailed.<br />\nShepard fits these details into the<br />\nplay like puzzle pieces, building<br />\na whole, and if any of the pieces<br />\nare missing or changed, then in<br />\na small way the play itself is incomplete or altered. Foeller is obviously aware of this danger, and<br />\nhis new ideas of set and staging<br />\nare an attempt to substitute the<br />\npieces with different ones, and<br />\nones that fit. Some of them do,<br />\nsome of them don't.<br />\nIn the original set design, for<br />\nexample, Shepard describes the<br />\n\"stark, low rent motel room on<br />\nthe edge of the Mojave Desert.<br />\nFaded green plaster walls. Dark<br />\nbrown linoleum floor. No rugs.\"<br />\nThe impression that the audience<br />\nshould receive is one of confinement and desolation, the small,<br />\ncramped room embodying the<br />\nemotionally escapeless situation<br />\nof Eddie and May. Foeller chose<br />\nto construct the walls of cinder<br />\nblock, echoing a prison cell, and<br />\nit works beautifully. The dirt<br />\nfloor also works well\u2014the barren<br />\nexpanse of the Mojave Desert,<br />\nperhaps the ultimate fence, is not<br />\njust hinted at outside the motel,<br />\nit is actually in the room with<br />\nthem. This adds a new dimension<br />\nto the moments in which Eddie<br />\nand May roll around on the sandy floor; they are no longer simply releasing emotion in a physical<br />\nfight, they are struggling in the<br />\ndirt that they know convention<br />\nhas defined as their relationship,<br />\nthe kind of residue that cannot be<br />\nbrushed off.<br />\nTrue to the intentions of the<br />\nplay, Foeller has also pushed the<br />\nentire set disarmingly close to the<br />\nedge of the stage, giving it a<br />\ncagey feel, and leaving little room<br />\nfor the characters to move<br />\naround. For the audience, the<br />\nshort stage places them almost inside the room with the characters,<br />\nthe earth-like floor even extending over the stage and into the<br />\ntheater itself. At times some of us<br />\nhad to be careful of the dirt which<br />\nflew across the front rows, or the<br />\ntequila that flew from the glasses.<br />\nThe intimacy of this set is certainly effective.<br />\nSome of the set does not work<br />\nas well. The walls are cut-offjust<br />\nabove the actors' heads, only<br />\nopening up the room. The pur-<br />\n<br />\npose of the short walls, it should<br />\nbe noted, is to accommodate the<br />\nrusty, broken down Plymouth on<br />\ntop of the set, where the character<br />\nof The Old Man sits, drinks, and<br />\ncomments on the situation. This<br />\nplacement is also a mistake. The<br />\nOld Man may be only inside the<br />\nheads of Eddie and May, but<br />\nShepard wanted him onstage in a<br />\nrocking chair, with the other<br />\ncharacters, the division of reality and fantasy completely broken<br />\ndown. By setting The Old Man<br />\nabove the action, Foeller immediately swings the balance in<br />\nfavor of fantasy. Even as The Old<br />\nMan moves about the characters<br />\nlater, it is too late to instill that<br />\nsense of uncertainty and the<br />\nsuspension of conventional notions of continuity which are a<br />\nShepard mark. The old<br />\nPlymouth, though an important<br />\nsymbol of the play and visually<br />\nspectacular, was never meant to<br />\nbe seen. The past is as real and<br />\nalive as the present in this play,<br />\nthe continuum of time and place<br />\nerased. The rusty heap before our<br />\neyes seems a contradiction, an<br />\nimage of a disintegrating and distant past.<br />\nThe lighting has also been<br />\naltered. Instead of surreal<br />\nheadlights cutting through the<br />\nwindows and doors of the room<br />\nat crucial moments in the play,<br />\nthe lights often come from the audience, which is less effective and<br />\ndoesn't make much sense. Again,<br />\nthe room seemed more open and<br />\nairy than it should have been.<br />\nThere were also too many<br />\ndoors; instead of one exterior and<br />\na bathroom door, there were four<br />\ndoors leading outside the motel<br />\nroom. One could argue that May<br />\nand Eddie's inability to escape, to<br />\nleave each other once and for all,<br />\ncomes from deep within their<br />\nhearts and a thousand doors<br />\nwould not make a difference. But<br />\nthe magic of Shepard is the<br />\npowerful translation of emotion<br />\nand situation into a complete<br />\ntheater experience, an attack on<br />\nall our senses which makes it<br />\n\"theater\" instead of staged<br />\ndialogue.<br />\nBut dialogue is just as important. Phyllis Lyons, who plays<br />\nMay, does a terrific job exploring the subtext of her character.<br />\nShe is a smart-ass, but under that<br />\nwe get a real sense of May as a<br />\nvictim\u2014of Fate, of her own<br />\ndesires, of Eddie, whom she hates<br />\nand loves with equal passion.<br />\nPeter Crombie is also cast well as<br />\nthe cowboy Eddie, although he is<br />\na little too charming. Eddie is as<br />\npractical as he is idealistic, as antagonistic as he is vulnerable, as<br />\nnoncommittal as he is devoted. He<br />\nis a mass of contradictions. Too<br />\nfew times did Crombie delve into the dark side of Eddie, the<br />\nmenacing half that enjoys conflict, who's pent-up emotions are<br />\nbarely reined. But the chemistry between Lyons and<br />\nCrombie is palpable, and Foeller<br />\nutilizes it to move the story with<br />\npowerful force.<br />\nAs far as the minor characters<br />\ngo, if there is such a thing in a<br />\nShepard play, George Bamford is<br />\nan honestly believable Martin, the<br />\nsimple man who comes to the<br />\nmotel to pick up May for a date<br />\n<br />\nand winds up as the backboard for<br />\nEddie and May's verbal games.<br />\nHe is confused, horrified,<br />\nbizarrely intrigued by the story,<br />\na member of the audience right on<br />\nstage voicing our own bewilderment: \"What the hell is happening here?\" William Hardy is also<br />\ngood as The Old Man, though it<br />\ntakes him a little while to warm<br />\nup, about the time he has more<br />\ndialogue and less sitting around<br />\non top of the set. But when he<br />\ngets rolling, he takes the part and<br />\nruns with it.<br />\nDespite the strengths of the per-<br />\n<br />\nformances, some of the changes<br />\nFoeller has made outside of the<br />\ndialogue remain questionable. He<br />\nremoves many of the directions<br />\nShepard included towards the end<br />\nof the play, directions that are<br />\ncrucial to the play's resolution.<br />\nGone are many of the lighting and<br />\nsound effects, such as the \"loud<br />\ncollision, shattering glass, and explosion. Bright orange and blue<br />\nlights of a gasoline fire.. .sounds<br />\nof horses screaming wildly,<br />\nhooves galloping on pavement.\"<br />\nShepard had important reasons<br />\nfor putting them in, and it's<br />\n<br />\nunclear why Foeller opted to ignore them. The explosion, the<br />\nscreaming horses, the final image<br />\nof the glowing fire slowly fading<br />\nto black all indicate some kind of<br />\napocalypse. But it is an ambiguous ending. Do these images<br />\nrepresent a relationship finally<br />\nshattered by the revelation and<br />\nconfrontation of the truth of its<br />\norigin? Or are they a symbol of<br />\na love that is somehow purged by<br />\na consuming self-destruction,<br />\ngiving it the chance to rebuild in<br />\nSee FOOL, 16<br />\n<br />\nDrinking poetry at the Pearl<br />\nby Ciaran Blumenfeld<br />\nMencken's Cultured Pearl Cafe<br />\n1114 Hollins St., 837-1947<br />\nYou may want to call for directions on this one, but if you can<br />\nfind your way there, Mencken's<br />\nis worth checking out at least once<br />\nonce while you're still here.

Regardless of<br />\nyour position on the \"nature versus nurture\" debate, you cannot<br />\ndeny the influence on everything<br />\nfrom health to intelligence. Dr.<br />\nVictor McKusick, director of the<br />\nMedical Genetics department at<br />\nJHMI, delivered a lecture to<br />\nFriends of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nLibraries about how scientists are<br />\npinpointing the locations of the<br />\ngenes that determine who we are.<br />\nMcKusick explained that the<br />\nhuman genome is the \"information system for how we<br />\ndevelop.\" It is the collection of<br />\nsomewhere between 50,000 to<br />\n100,000 genes. Genes are found<br />\nin the nuclei of cells, on structures commonly known as<br />\nchromosomes. Humans have 23<br />\nchromosomes. To map the human<br />\ngenome means to locate the genes<br />\nresponsible for genetic diseases,<br />\nskin color, and other traits on particular parts along one of the 23<br />\nchromosomes. These locations<br />\nare common to all human beings,<br />\nbut the structure of the genes<br />\nvaries and produces unique<br />\npeople.<br />\nSeveral characteristics in<br />\nhuman beings have been traced<br />\nback to a genetic cause.<br />\nMcKusick is the editor of the<br />\ndefinitive catalog of these known<br />\ngenes, \"Moundelian Inheritance in<br />\nMan (MIM)\", which is in its<br />\neighth edition and is available on<br />\ndatabase from the Welch Medical<br />\n<br />\nLibrary. As of his lecture, 4534<br />\ngenetically-determined characteristics were listed on the<br />\nMIM database. Of these 4534<br />\ngenes, 1450 had been mapped to<br />\na certain location along one of the<br />\n23 chromosomes.<br />\nThe first genes ever mapped<br />\nwere located on chromosome 23.<br />\nChromosome 23 is different from<br />\nthe other chromosomes since it is<br />\nthe sex chromosome. One X<br />\ncomponent and one Y component<br />\nmake a male, and two X components determine a female. Obviously, the Y does not determine<br />\nthe same traits as the X. Traits on<br />\nthe other 22 chromosomes are<br />\nfound on both components in both<br />\nsexes. Males have only one X<br />\ncomponent\u2014whatever trait it<br />\ncodes for cannot be counteracted<br />\nby the Y component. In females,<br />\nhowever, one gene may be on and<br />\nthe other off, producing a half<br />\ndose, or both may be on or off.<br />\nGenes on the X component exhibit a distinct pattern of inheritance called X-linkage. Thus,<br />\nby studying pedigrees, genes can<br />\nbe mapped to the X component.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has always been<br />\non the forefront of the genemapping effort. In 1911, E.B.<br />\nWilson, a Hopkins doctoral candidate, succeeded in mapping the<br />\nfirst gene, the red-green colorblindness gene, to chromosome<br />\n23. He saw that women were<br />\nrarely color-blind. Mom's dad<br />\ngave her his X component, making her a carrier. She had a 50<br />\n<br />\npercent chance of giving her son<br />\nher X with color-blindness.<br />\nWhere color-blindness ran in<br />\nfamilies, Wilson found that it exactly followed this X-linkage<br />\npattern.<br />\nX-linked genes were the only<br />\nones that could be mapped for<br />\nseveral decades. However, new<br />\nisolating<br />\nfor<br />\ntechniques<br />\nchromosomes and examining<br />\nthem led to another breakthrough<br />\nby another Hopkins Ph.D. candidate. In 1968, Roger Donahue<br />\nexamined his own chromosomes,<br />\nand found that his chromosome 1<br />\nwas abnormal. He examined his<br />\nrelatives' chromosomes and<br />\nfound the same defect in some of<br />\nthem. He searched for a<br />\ncharacteristic that they all shared,<br />\nand realized that all had the same<br />\nDuffy blood type.<br />\nChromosomes are made of<br />\nstrands of protein and DNA.<br />\nDNA is a huge molecule that is<br />\ncomposed of 4 subunits referred<br />\nto as bases, and symbolized as<br />\nG(guanine), A(adenosine),<br />\nT(tyrosine), and C(cytosine). The<br />\nsequence of bases is critical, as it<br />\ndetermines what proteins the<br />\nDNA codes for, which determine<br />\nthe traits found in people. One<br />\ngene codes for one protein.<br />\nHopkins also rides the crest of<br />\nnew technologies for sequencing<br />\nDNA.<br />\nIn 1978, Hopkins molecular<br />\nbiologists Hamilton Smith and<br />\nDan Nathan shared a Nobel Prize<br />\nfor their use of restriction en-<br />\n<br />\nzymes to sequence DNA. These<br />\nare proteins which cut DNA only at specific sites. EcoRI, a widely used restriction enzyme, cuts<br />\nafter the guanine in the series<br />\nGTAAC. By exposing many<br />\ncopies of the same molecule of<br />\nDNA to several different restriction enzymes, Smith and Nathan<br />\nwere able to determine some of<br />\nthe sequence of that DNA.<br />\nSequencing the human genome<br />\nis an immense task. McKusick<br />\nestimates that to list all of the<br />\nthree billion base pairs in one<br />\nhuman being's genome, just by<br />\nG, T, A, or C, would require a<br />\nlibrary equivalent to thirteen sets<br />\nof the Encyclopaedia Britannica.<br />\nStill, it is worth the effort.<br />\nResearch on genetic diseases like<br />\nAlzheimer's Disease was stalled.<br />\nScientists knew there was a<br />\ngenetic link, but they did not<br />\nknow which gene was responsialleged<br />\nNow, the<br />\nble.<br />\nAlzheimer's gene has been mapped.

Brian<br />\nDulin, who needed 111 yards going into the game to become the<br />\n<br />\nsecond leading rusher in<br />\nHopkins's history, pounded<br />\nthrough the Green Terror defense<br />\nas the Jays moved the ball to the<br />\nWestern Maryland 12-yard line<br />\nAfter converting on two fourthand-one plays, Dulin finally<br />\nscored on a one-yard plunge to tie<br />\nthe game at 7-7.<br />\nLate in the second quarter.<br />\nHopkins was able to take advantage of Steve Davis's interception<br />\nof a Joe Faber pass at the Hopkins<br />\n40. Once again, the Jays ran<br />\nthrough the Green Terror<br />\ndefense, only this time it was<br />\nsenior Chris Chirieleison who<br />\nscored on a 6-yard run to put<br />\nHopkins in front 14-7.<br />\nMuch of the crowd at<br />\nHomewood field remained<br />\npessimistic at halftime, even<br />\nthough the Blue Jays had a 14-7<br />\nlead.

With around five<br />\nminutes to play, the Green Terrors drove 68 yards to the<br />\nHopkins 12-yard line. The Blue<br />\nJays, however, tightened up and<br />\nheld Western Maryland on a<br />\nfourth-and-two to take over the<br />\nball. But after the offense once<br />\nagain was forced to punt, the<br />\ndefense was put right back on the<br />\nfield as the Green Terrors took<br />\nover on the Hopkins 40-yard line<br />\nwith three minutes to play.<br />\nWestern Maryland moved the ball<br />\nquickly to the four yard-line<br />\nwhere they were given four shots<br />\nat scoring. They tried running<br />\nFrees to the outside, but Brian<br />\nHepting and Joe Sokolowski were<br />\nthere to cut off the plays for no<br />\ngain. After a failed pass, the<br />\ngame came down to a last fourth<br />\ndown play. Terror quarterback<br />\nJoe Faber lofted a pass across the<br />\nmiddle of the end zone, but it<br />\nlanded right in the arms of Brian<br />\nHepting to seal the victory for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"This win meant a hell of a lot<br />\nto the seniors,\" said Fenzel.<br />\n\"This is the game that will stick<br />\n<br />\nwith us the rest of our lives. It<br />\ntakes some of the sting out of losing the other ones.\"<br />\nMaybe some of the sting, but<br />\ndefinitely not all of it. The 1988<br />\nseason was a definite disappointment for the Blue Jays. With a<br />\nstrong crop of freshmen and a<br />\ngreat group of returning players,<br />\nHopkins had high expectations<br />\ngoing into the season. So what<br />\nhappened?<br />\nThe biggest problem with the<br />\nJays this season was the slow<br />\nstart. The first five games were<br />\nones that Hopkins definitely could<br />\nhave won, but offensive problems<br />\nkept coach Jerry Pfeifer's team<br />\nwinless. The main cause of these<br />\nproblems were at quarterback.<br />\nThe Blue Jays switched to a<br />\nwishbone offense at the beginning of the season, an offense<br />\nwhich relies heavily on a good<br />\noption quarterback. The decision<br />\nto change the offense, however,<br />\nmay have been a hasty one,<br />\nbecause Hopkins didn't have a<br />\nquarterback with the quickness or<br />\noption experience to run the<br />\nwishbone. Offensive problems<br />\nwere further complicated by the<br />\nsee FOOTBALL, 22<br />\n<br />\nBasketball tips off tomorrow<br />\n<br />\nMen's and Women's<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nwere obviously more fired up<br />\nthan the Green Terrors.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense once<br />\nagain sputtered in the third<br />\nquarter, as Western Maryland put<br />\neight men on the line in an attempt to slow the Blue Jays running attack. Gary Rupert was<br />\nunable to open up the airways, as<br />\nhe was pressured into rushing his<br />\nthrows and missing open men.<br />\nDulin was frustrated for almost<br />\nall of the second half, as he finished the day with 92 yards on 22<br />\ncarries and fell just short of moving up on the all-time rushing list.<br />\nBut it really didn't matter if the<br />\nJays scored any more points,<br />\nbecause as the game progressed,<br />\nit became increasingly obvious<br />\nthat the defense was not going to<br />\nlet the Green Terrors score.<br />\nCharles Johnson-Bey, the senior<br />\nlinebacker, was all over the field<br />\nand kept Frees from getting outside where he could do the most<br />\ndamage. Mike Fenzel, playing at<br />\ndefensive tackle for much of the<br />\ngame due to injuries on the line,<br />\nalso did an excellent job of containing Frees, and he constantly<br />\napplied pressure when Western<br />\nMaryland tried to pass.

This 5' 11\" forward<br />\nfrom Little Fall, New Jersey, is a strong<br />\nathlete who suffered an injury in her senior<br />\nyear of high school, preventing her from<br />\nplaying Division I ball.

Hopkins's top three players are<br />\nreturning to the court, and third year coach<br />\nNancy Blank has high expectations for her<br />\nyoung team. \"Although we are young, we<br />\nexpect a lot from the sophomore recruits.<br />\nWe anticipate an over .500 season, which<br />\nhasn't been done by a Hopkins women's<br />\nteam in recent years.\"<br />\nThe Lady Jays lost three players from<br />\nlast year's 8-12 team to graduation. Laura<br />\nPorter (8.2 points per game), Jeanne Clark<br />\n(4 points per game), and Cindy Harper<br />\n(8.9 points per game) will be missed largely in terms of leadership.<br />\nHopkins is in a transitional period this<br />\nseason. The entire team is composed of<br />\nfreshman and sophomores, which, according to Coach Blank, \"will be a factor in<br />\nterms of leadership.\"<br />\nTaking over the leadership role will be<br />\na trio of seasoned sophomores. Forward<br />\nco-captain Kristi Kantowski, a 5' 11\"<br />\nsophomore from Ellicott City, Maryland,<br />\nled the team in scoring last season with a<br />\nfourteen point average. Kantowski also<br />\npulled down 6.1 rebounds per game and<br />\nis the glue of this young team. She is the<br />\nmotivational factor on the team according<br />\nto her coach. Blank has adjusted the team's<br />\noffense to make Kristi more of a scoring<br />\nthreat.<br />\nSophomore co-captain Julianne Rolapp<br />\nled last year's team in assists with 45 and<br />\nin three point shots, scoring on 41 percent<br />\nof her attempts from beyond the 19' 9\"<br />\narc.

According to Kantowski, \"the new<br />\nfreshmen will help us out a lot this<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nThe 1988-89 team will very likely he the<br />\ngrace the courts at JHU. They are a quick<br />\nteam with a lot of confidence in one<br />\nanother. The Lady Jays' speed in the open<br />\ncourt will make up for their lack of height<br />\nand should account for a lot of scoring opportunities this season. This quickness<br />\nshould help out on the season opener on<br />\nSaturday against the University of<br />\nChicago, which boasts three girls over 6'<br />\nin their line up. This 6:00 game should be<br />\na battle on the boards but Coach Blank is<br />\nexpecting to pull out a win by running on<br />\ntheir less agile opponents. Co-captain<br />\nRolapp anticipates success as well. \"We<br />\ndefinitely have improved over last season.<br />\nThis may be the first time that the girl's<br />\nteam could have a winning reputation .\"<br />\nThis season marks Hopkins's true arrival<br />\ninto UAA basketball. Hopkins has been<br />\nranked fifth in the preliminary rankings,<br />\nbut the differences between the top five are<br />\nrelatively insignificant. Hopkins will be<br />\nmaking five road trips this winter, which<br />\nis a lot of travelling in comparison to recent years. This could bring a fatigue factor into play as the season draws to a close.<br />\nCo-captain Kantowski is enthusiastic about<br />\nthe upcoming trips. \"It [the season] will<br />\nbe really exciting with all of the travelling<br />\nwe will be doing. \"<br />\nCoach Blanck, a seasoned veteran with<br />\na 130-102 career record, will be assisted<br />\nby Maureen McHugh, now in her third<br />\nseason with the Jays.

Returning rowers are fine-tuning their<br />\ntechnique and building speed and<br />\nendurance and are thus becoming<br />\nincreasingly competitive with<br />\nother crews.

So, to recap the early playoff action: Vincent/Willard<br />\nsqueaked out a victory over<br />\nAdams 15-13; Hollander<br />\ncrushed McCoy 26-0; Gildersleeve beat Royce/Sylvester<br />\n26-13; and Baker defeated Wood<br />\n13-6.<br />\nOn to new business. Today is<br />\nSuper Bowl Friday. The dorm<br />\nchampionship will be played at 3<br />\np.m. WAWA meets Phi Psi for<br />\nthe Division I title at 4 p.m. and<br />\nthe Division II championship is<br />\nalso at 4 p.m. You don't want to<br />\nmiss these games (unless, like<br />\nme, you're going to be in California for the USC-UCLA game).<br />\nGames will be played rain or<br />\nshine. The winners will receive<br />\nBIA shirts.<br />\nThe results of the exciting pingpong tournament are in. Phi Psi<br />\nbeat WAWA in the finals. In the<br />\ndorms, Pat Chang (Vincent/Willard) won it all. McCoy,<br />\nClark, and Building A finished<br />\n2,3,4.<br />\nThe volleyball results are being<br />\ntabulated.

WAWA has<br />\n95, but won 3 on 3, and is a heavy<br />\nfavorite in football. Look for<br />\nthem to make it a tight 3-way race<br />\nfor the trophy.<br />\nAny questions this week?

Hopkins<br />\nboats are outrowing boats that used to leave us in their wakes. This<br />\nseason's novices, who use the fall<br />\nseason to learn the basics of rowing, are turning out to be<br />\nthreatening for other crews and<br />\nlook to be a solid base for future<br />\nvarsity boats. Captains John<br />\nFaulkingham of the men's team<br />\nand Kelly Kieffer of the women's<br />\nhave, through the several coxswains, shaped the form and synchronized the timing of the<br />\nrowers. This process, although<br />\nfar from complete, has given the<br />\noarspersons victories which the<br />\nforce of uncontrolled pull would<br />\nnot. As the rowers individually<br />\ncontinue to develop finesse, more<br />\nvictories from their shells are<br />\nexpected.<br />\nThe crew season opened on<br />\nSeptember 9th at the King's Head<br />\nRegatta on the Schuykill River in<br />\nPennsylvania. The Men's Varsity Lightweight Four, the only<br />\nHopkins boat entered, captured<br />\nfirst in their race. Hopkins's next<br />\nraces were at the Head of the<br />\nPotomac in Georgetown, where<br />\nthe same Lightweight Four finished ahead of all other Lightweight<br />\ncrews in a race dominated by<br />\nHeavyweights. The other crews<br />\nentered in the regatta represented<br />\nolder and much better-financed<br />\nprograms than that of Hopkins.<br />\nYet Hopkins pulled a respectable<br />\nshowing, with the Women's Varsity Eight only twenty-four<br />\nseconds behind such competition.<br />\nIn a head race of about twenty<br />\nminutes, the Hopkins crews were<br />\nimpressive.<br />\nAt the Arid l Regatta,<br />\nBaltimore's races for crews from<br />\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, and<br />\nD.C., the Hopkins Varsity blew<br />\nthe competition out of the water.<br />\nThe Men's Varsity Lightweight<br />\nFour took first place, while the<br />\nHopkins JV took third. The<br />\nMen's Heavyweight Four took<br />\nthird place of five in their race.<br />\nTwo Men's Novice Eights from<br />\nHopkins placed third and fourth<br />\nin another race. The Women's<br />\nVarsity Eight, consisting largely<br />\nof last year's Novice Eight, who<br />\nplaced poorly at the '87 Arid, left<br />\nthe competition in the distant mist<br />\nthis year and sailed across the<br />\nfinish of their first-ever first place<br />\nvictory. The Women's Novice<br />\n<br />\nEight, powerful in strength and<br />\nwill, placed second in their race.<br />\nAt the internationally known<br />\nHead of the Charles Regatta in<br />\nBoston on October 23, the Men's<br />\nLightweight Four clashed oars<br />\nwith Dartmouth's shell while trying to overtake another boat. This<br />\nbit of whitewater and drama cost<br />\nHopkins about thirty seconds and<br />\nprobably five places in the race.<br />\nThey ended up 16th in a race of<br />\nmany more.<br />\nIn Virginia, the Head of the<br />\nOccoquien Regatta saw high<br />\nwinds, thunder, lightning, rain,<br />\nhail, and eventually a rainbow<br />\nspanning the river, the symbolism<br />\nof which seemed too obvious to<br />\nignore. Aside from the more<br />\nhackneyed poetic considerations,<br />\nthe precipitation had left the<br />\ncrews shivering and with the<br />\noverpowering desire for the finish<br />\nline and warm clothing. The<br />\nMen's Lightweight Four finished<br />\n28 seconds behind the first place<br />\nNew York maritime crew, with<br />\na place of third, while the<br />\nHeavyweight Four finished fourth,<br />\nwith a time of 20:50, 24 seconds<br />\nthe Lightweights in the race.<br />\nMen's Novice Eights from<br />\nHopkins took sixth and ninth in<br />\na field of thirteen. The Women's<br />\nVarsity Eight beat three boats,<br />\nwhich in the past have beaten<br />\nHopkins to place fourth after<br />\nthree boats from University of<br />\nVirginia and George Mason.<br />\nUVA's A boat won with a time<br />\nof 19:25 while the Hopkins<br />\nwomen rowed the three and onehalf miles in 20:16. The<br />\nWomen's Novice Eight was<br />\neleventh of fifteen.<br />\nThe successes of the fall give<br />\nthe Hopkins crew hope for the<br />\nupcoming Frostbite Regatta to be<br />\nheld in Philadelphia on Saturday,<br />\nNovember 19th. The regatta is a<br />\nchampionship of smaller schools<br />\nand the crews entering are excellent. Hopkins, though, is confident. In a head race, where<br />\ncrews are started one after<br />\nanother, with intervals or time<br />\nallowing each crew several<br />\nboatlengths to advance, crews<br />\nstarted behind others can pull<br />\nahead and surpass the crews<br />\nahead. This fall, Hopkins crew<br />\nhas been gaining on the competition and the spring looks<br />\npromising.<br />\n<br />\nHockey blanked by Hoyas<br />\nby Phillip Kouyoumdjian<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Blue Jays<br />\nIce Hockey Team hopes more<br />\nice-time is the answer to their<br />\nlackluster offensive performance<br />\nin their 4-0 loss against<br />\nGeorgetown last Thursday on<br />\nNovember 10.<br />\n\"These guys(Georgetown) have<br />\nalready played four games,\" said<br />\nnewly-appointed Hopkins coach<br />\nSteve Worth. \"We've only had<br />\nfour practices. If we keep working as hard as we have been in<br />\npractice, things will start coming<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nGeorgetown was, in fact, in<br />\nbetter shape than the Jays as they<br />\nalways seemed a step quicker to<br />\nthe puck. The greater amount of<br />\nice-time was demonstrated by<br />\nhasty break-outs from their own<br />\nend, crisp passing, and intelligent<br />\nset plays inside the Jays' blue<br />\nline. Georgetown's superior<br />\n<br />\nplaymaking really showed as they<br />\ntallied two of their four goals on<br />\npower-play opportunities.<br />\nHopkins's defense, on the other<br />\nhand, proved to be quite sound.<br />\nSophomore goaltender Ross Henshaw played extremely well, saving twenty-six out of thirty shots.<br />\nThe main factor in the Blue<br />\nJays' loss, however, was the<br />\nemotional let-down after<br />\nGeorgetown scored its third goal<br />\nearly in the second period.<br />\n\"After that third goal, we just<br />\ngave up,\" explained Worth.\"We<br />\ncan't do that. I don't care if the<br />\nscore's 7-0.\"<br />\nHopkins's next game is at home<br />\nagainst Western Maryland this<br />\nThursday. They play two weeks<br />\nlater against Towson State.

Ambassador uncertain<br />\nover future U.S. foreign policy<br />\nby Anne Langley<br />\nDid President Ronald Reagan<br />\ndo a good job in the area of<br />\nforeign relations? What is the current status and direction of EastWest and West-West relations?<br />\nWhat are Soviet Premier Mikhail<br />\nGorbachev's goals and underlying intentions in his overtures<br />\ntoward better relations with thL<br />\nUnited States and with other<br />\ncountries? Ambassador Eigil<br />\nJorgensen, Danish ambassador to<br />\nthe U.S., spoke briefly about<br />\nthese issues when he addressed a<br />\nModel United Nations meeting on<br />\nTuesday.<br />\nTo begin, Jorgensen said,<br />\n\"relations between the U.S. and<br />\nEurope have been excellent under<br />\nReagan,\" and he expressed his<br />\nhope that the Bush Administration<br />\nwill continue many of the policies<br />\nthat have been established.<br />\nForeign policy, he said, is<br />\nentering a very important phase,<br />\nwith a challenging future ahead.<br />\n\"We are in a transition period,\"<br />\nsaid Jorgensen. \"There is a 'certain uncertainty' concerning EastWest and West-West relations.\"<br />\nGorbachev's efforts, begun in<br />\n1985, marked the beginning of a<br />\nnew era. This new era holds great<br />\npromise, said Jorgensen, but, at<br />\nthe same time, relations have<br />\nbecome less predictable.<br />\nRelations other than those with<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. are changing as<br />\nwell. Specifically, Jorgensen saw<br />\na new kind of relationship<br />\ndeveloping between the U.S. and<br />\nEurope. \"Europe is no longer a<br /><br />\ncountry on its knees,\" he said.<br />\n\"...The Europe of 1946 no<br />\nlonger exists.\" To accomodate<br />\nthese changing needs and attitudes, strong waves of reform<br />\nare altering the economy, defense<br />\nspending, and North Atlantic<br />\nTreaty Organization relations in<br />\nEurope.<br />\nOne of the most significant of<br />\nthese changes will be the integrated market, or common<br />\nmarket, to be formally adopted in<br />\n1992. Major questions exist<br />\nregarding the widespread impact<br />\nof this new European market,<br />\nmany of which cannot be fully<br />\nanswered until the market is in<br />\nplace.<br />\nJorgensen said the market will<br />\nbe a challenge to the U.S., but<br />\nthat this challenge is manageable<br />\nand in the long run will be<br />\nbeneficial. The Common Market<br />\n(EEC) will lead to a \"European<br />\npillar\" economically, estaban<br />\nas<br />\nEurope<br />\nlishing<br />\neconomic equal. In regard to<br />\nDenmark in particular, Jorgensen<br />\nexpressed concern that current industries are not competitive and<br />\nthat the Common Market will<br />\nfoster competition.<br />\nAnother issue of concern to the<br />\nU.S. and Europe is relations with<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. According to<br />\nJorgensen, \"U.S.S.R. relations<br />\nare no longer dominated by the<br />\nrigid policy of the Kremlin. There<br />\nare many reforms [in the hands<br />\nof Gorbachev], but no one knows<br />\nat this point where they will<br />\nlead.\"<br />\nHe added that the U.S.S.R. has<br /><br />\nbeen much more flexible about<br />\nresolving conflicts. In the area of<br />\ndefense, the U.S.S.R. has stated<br />\nthat it wants to change its policy<br />\nto a purely defensive one, but so<br />\nfar no concrete action has been<br />\ntaken.<br />\nIn economic terms, the<br />\nU.S.S.R. has seen it in its own interest to improve its economic<br />\nsituation. Jorgensen said, \"We<br />\nbelieve it is in the West's interest<br />\nto help [them].\" Europe has<br />\nrecently agreed to lend the<br />\nU.S.S.R. $9 billion in accordance<br />\nwith this belief.<br />\nJorgensen expressed the idea<br />\nthat Europe is generally less<br />\nideological and more pragmatic<br />\nwhen it comes to relations with<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. Despite specific<br />\npolicy action differences,<br />\nhowever, Europe fully agrees<br />\nwith the U.S. overall in regard to<br />\nrelations with the Soviet Union.<br />\nJorgensen assessed the relationship between the U.S. and<br />\nEurope as \"healthy and good.\"<br />\nDisagreements on specifics are a<br />\nsign of health, and adjustments<br />\nare on the way. That is true for<br />\nEurope internally as well. Denmark's own needs are well served by the development of the<br />\nEuropean Community and the<br />\nchanges in NATO.<br />\nJorgensen expressed hope that<br />\nthe ties between Europe and the<br />\nU.S. will be strengthened even<br />\nfurther. \"The historic bonds of<br />\nfriendship between the U.S. and<br />\nEurope are unabated,\" he said.<br />\n\"We could not do without each<br />\nother.\"<br /><br />\nUnder proposed Seals rules,<br />\nSAC would still play key role<br />\nSEALS from 4<br />\nExec Board would not try to<br />\ndetermine which students have<br />\ncontributed to that activity.<br />\nSophomore Jonathan Roberts,<br />\nanother Exec Board member, explained, \"We feel qualified to<br />\njudge groups, not individuals.\"<br />\nThe following are potential examples of how such analysis<br />\nmight work:<br />\na) The Young College<br />\nModerates, an SAC group with<br />\nfifty members, requests an allotment of four Seals. The Exec<br />\nBoard determines that the group<br />\ndoes not deserve many Seals<br />\nbecause of its few demonstrable<br />\nactivities, but may deserve more<br />\nthan one Seal because of its high<br />\nmembership.<br />\nb) The Left-Right Centrists, an<br />\nSAC group with ten members, requests four Seals. The Exec<br />\nBoard determines that the group<br />\nhas sponsored many lectures and<br />\nhas held frequent debates on<br />\nmany issues. Thus, the Exec<br /><br />\nYEA<br /><br />\nNAY<br /><br />\nStudents favoring<br />\nSeals proposal<br /><br />\nStudents opposing<br />\nSeals proposal<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nBoard would have to weigh the<br />\ngroup's small size against its<br />\nmany accomplishments in<br />\ndeciding whether to award one or<br />\nmore Seals.<br />\nAt Wednesday's assembly, opposition to the revised Seals plan<br />\nwas still strong but considerably<br />\nless caustic than it was last week.<br />\nAt the end of the assembly, Barnforth took a straw poll and found<br />\nthe audience favored the new proposal by a 12-10 margin. This<br />\nvote is the only numerical data the<br />\nExec Board has from the approximately seventy groups there and<br />\nthousands of student participants.<br />\nBamforth, Student Council<br />\nPresident and Exec Board<br />\nmember Lou Giangiulio, and<br />\nRoberts were surprised at the<br /><br />\nCAMPUS CRIME<br />\nLarceny<br />\n\u2022Between October 30 and 31,<br />\nsomeone removed a vacuum<br />\ncleaner from a custodial closet<br />\nin the Athletic Center.

The Exec Board<br />\nmembers never specifically<br />\nanswered that charge, focusing,<br />\ninstead on the potential advantages of having groups who may<br />\nknow of their members' accomplishments better choosing<br />\nSeals recipients, instead of the<br />\nExec Board.<br />\nShould groups face \"intense<br />\ncompetition\" internally, said<br />\nBamforth, \"maybe two nominations should come to the Board.<br /><br />\n,HOW QUICKLY CAN YOU REACT?<br />\nSHOW US TO EARN $300<br />\nWork 4 DAYS in a research setting at Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine.

Questions of<br />\nacademic ethics are brought<br />\nbefore the board, investigated and<br />\nreviewed, and appropriate action<br />\nis taken. An honor code, if found<br />\nfeasible and if supported by the<br />\nstudents, would take the place of<br />\nthe Ethics Board.<br />\nThe Student Council Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee on the Honor Code is<br />\nexamining the possibility of instituting an honor code at<br />\nHopkins. A sixty-year honor code<br />\nhere was dissolved in 1975 at the<br />\nrequest of the students.<br />\nOmbudsman Sigmund Suskind,<br />\nArts and Sciences dean at the time<br />\nof the dissolution, noted a general<br />\nfeeling that the students could not<br />\ncontrol the level of cheating, and<br />\nthat the honor code and the honor<br />\nboard were not functioning properly. The students wanted help<br />\nfrom the administration and<br />\nfaculty in addressing questions of<br />\nethics.<br />\nThe honor code was discontinued with a promise from<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller that students should feel<br />\nfree to petition to reinstate it at<br />\nany time.<br />\nAn honor code places the immediate burden of an ethicallysound academic atmosphere on<br />\nthe shoulders of the students. It<br />\nwould require students to turn in<br />\noffenders, permit unproctored exams, require students to sign an<br />\nhonor pledge, and, upon infraction, to face a trial by peers.<br />\nFaculty would have a distinct<br />\nbut less prominent role in helping to create this atmosphere.<br />\nTheir obligation would be to do<br />\neverything possible to make the<br />\nconditions of a class fair and<br />\nequal for all students. They, too,<br />\nwould report infractions and use<br />\nthe honor court to determine guilt<br />\nand punish offenders.<br />\nLast year's honor code committee, which thought an honor<br />\ncode desirable, submitted a report<br />\non the issue in April. The report<br />\nincluded a general description of<br />\nthe honor code and an outline of<br />\nthe major problems involved with<br />\nimplementation.<br />\nEducation Committee Chair<br />\nJeff DeCagna, a member of the<br />\ncommittee, said one of the biggest<br />\nquestions facing such a committee is the problem of implementation: \"Because of the keen<br />\ncompetition, it is difficult to enforce an honor code,\" he said.<br />\nThe report outlined a tentative<br />\nplan for the pursuit of an effective honor code.<br />\nThe first stages of this plan<br />\nhave begun, as a new committee<br />\nunder Chairman Jeremy Klausner<br />\ngot under way. Posters encouraging students to think about<br />\ncheating have appeared around<br />\ncampus. According to Klausner,<br />\nthese posters are meant to<br />\ngenerate awareness and discussion and represent the first step<br />\ntowards the education of the<br />\nSee HONOR, 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\nBME honor code remains<br />\nsubordinate to Ethics Board<br />\nHONOR, from 6<br />\nHopkins community about the<br />\nissue.<br />\nKlausner said the next step for<br />\nthe committee is to look closely<br />\nat the other schools' honor codes<br />\nand come up with a semester-bysemester plan of attack. \"We<br />\ncan't really move from not having an honor code to having one<br />\nin one step,\" he said. \"It is a problem of integration and education<br />\nabout the issue.\"<br />\nInterest in an honor code is not<br />\nlimited to the committee and Student Council. The Department of<br />\nBiomedical Engineering is implementing its own departmental<br />\nhonor code. The code, written by<br />\nthree students at the end of last<br />\nyear, has undergone many revisions and is now in the final<br />\nstages of approval. It will probably be in place by next<br />\nsemester.<br />\nEric Young, BME undergraduate coordinator, has been<br />\nworking with the students in<br />\nestablishing this code. The code<br />\nincludes some of the same principles being considered by the Ad<br />\nHoc Honor Code Committee, but<br />\nis limited by requirements of the<br />\nEthics Board.<br />\nSince it applies to only one<br />\ndepartment, the code must be<br />\nconsistent with current policy and<br />\nfall under Ethics Board jurisdiction. Young emphasized that the<br />\nBME code was studentmotivated, but saw definite faculty support and involvement.<br />\n\"Some faculty members have<br />\nbeen unhappy about violations in<br />\nthe last couple of years. . . We expect the students to behave in an<br />\nethical fashion,\" he said.<br />\nA major question facing BME<br />\nand the honor code committee is<br />\nthe compatibility of such a departmental honor code with the<br />\ndevelopment of a University-wide<br />\nhonor code.<br />\nKlausner is apprehensive about<br />\nthe BME code: \"I think it's going to create problems,\" he said.<br />\n\"It creates a division among the<br />\nHopkins community in regard to<br />\nethics.\"<br />\nYoung does not share this<br />\nview. \"The BME honor code<br />\nwould be no impediment to a<br />\nUniversity-wide honor code,\" he<br />\nsaid. A university code would<br />\noverride the BME code.\"<br />\nAlex Kemper, a member of the<br />\nBME society working to implement the code, also saw no interference. He said that because<br />\nBME is a small, well-defined<br />\ngroup, implementation is easier.<br />\nHe suggested the BME code<br />\nserve as a model for a more<br />\ngeneral code.<br />\nThe question remains: Is an<br />\nhonor code a feasible possibility?<br />\nJohn Gryder, chemistry professor, said that in 1975 cheating<br />\nwas rampant and the abolition of<br />\nthe code was good in that having<br />\na code under the conditions of<br />\nwas<br />\nabuse<br />\nwidespread<br />\nhypocritical.<br />\nGryder favors the idea of an<br />\nhonor code, saying, \"When it<br />\ndoes work it makes life so much<br />\nbetter.\u2014 He does not believe now<br />\nthat students would report<br />\ncheaters.<br />\nGryder and Suskind said the<br />\ndissolution of the honor system<br /><br />\nwas, and is, a sociological issue.<br />\nAccording to Suskind, 1975 saw<br />\n\"no sympathy for a system that<br />\nrequired students to report on<br />\nother students.\" The students<br />\nsimply did not want the<br />\nresponsibility.<br />\nSuskind pointed out that in the<br />\ngraduate program unproctored<br />\ntests are successfully administered. Still, he noted the<br />\nspecial considerations of<br />\ncredibility in their field and of a<br />\nsmaller, less diffuse pool of<br />\nstudents in that program.<br />\nSuskind suggested the University \"should be teaching integrity, trust, and ethics here vs well<br />\nas academics.\"<br />\nMany schools that have an<br />\nhonor code have experienced problems with it in the past. Notable<br />\ncodes exist at the service<br />\nacademies, the California Institute of Technology, Princeton<br /><br />\nUniversity, and The University of<br />\nVirginia. The honor code has<br />\nbeen criticized at each of these<br />\nplaces, but the codes have<br />\npersevered.<br />\nUVA's code is often used as a<br />\nmodel for schools looking into the<br />\nissue. Associate Dean for<br />\nAcademic Advising Martha<br />\nRo,eman said an honor code<br />\nanywhere will constantly change,<br />\nadjusting to each situation as it<br />\narises.

He said strongly, \"No<br />\nwarhead research is taking<br />\nplace.\" He said funding for the<br />\nlab was about $350 million annually, this budget \"separate but<br />\nequal\" to that of the other divisions' budgets.<br />\nCochran has said earlier that<br />\n\"we don't deal with nuclear<br />\nwarheads or ballistics.

He indicated\u2022 that the APL received<br />\n$42.6 million for \"kinetic-energy<br />\nweapons\" that can fire highspeed projectiles in outer space.<br />\nHe also noted that between<br />\n1981 and 1986, the University<br />\nreceived $449.7 million for work<br />\non the Trident ballistic missiles.<br />\nThe Trident II is particularly con- \u2022<br />\ntroversial because it is a \"firststrike\" for the naval AEGIS<br />\nradar system, which was used extensively in operations against<br />\nLibya and malfunctioned tragically in an incident over the Persian<br />\nGulf.<br />\nOrlashevsky said, \"Hopkins<br />\nand MIT are in the top 100<br />\nmilitary contractors of the<br />\nDepartment of Defense.

Hopkins is<br />\nplacing the priority of building<br />\nweapons of destruction over<br />\naiding the homeless and others.<br />\nWhat kind of priorities are<br />\nthose?\"<br />\nThese controversies seemed to<br />\nforeshadow similarly controversial incidents involving APL. One<br />\ninvolved industrial photographer<br />\nTerry Corbett, who asked not to<br />\nbe connected in any way with any<br />\nof the other persons mentioned in<br />\nthis article.<br />\nHe had worked in Defense for<br />\nnine years before coming to<br />\nHopkins because of a \"consolidation of operations.\" He responded to an advertisement calling for<br />\npersons to photograph equipment<br />\nSee APL, 9<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/9<br /><br />\n. . . but protesters decry APL's<br />\nalleged military connections<br />\nAPL, from 8<br />\nand devices for Hopkins journals<br />\nand the Department of Defense.<br />\nThen he discovered that he was<br />\nalso being asked to photograph<br />\ndemonstrators against the APL<br />\nfor court purposes.<br />\nHe told his superiors, \"This<br />\nisn't in my job description.\" Six<br />\nmonths later, a new supervisor<br />\nentered his department and issued<br />\na written reprimand that suggested Corbett's actions were<br />\nsomehow' detrimental to society.\" When Corbett approached<br />\nthe personnel department, he was<br />\noffered the ultimatum of either<br />\nphotographing protesters or finding work elsewhere since \"no<br />\nfurther jobs are available here.\"<br />\nHe indicated that he had never<br />\ntaken any photographs of protesters, but others had, and<br />\n\"posters were made with the<br />\nfaces and names of all the protesters in 1987; twenty-five<br />\ncopies were made of each face,<br />\nto be mailed to the Pentagon.\"<br />\nAnother incident involved two<br />\nmembers of Jonah House, Dale<br />\nAshera-Davis and John Heid, and<br />\na Hopkins graduate student,<br />\nRichard Kramer. These three<br />\nissued a statement of their opinions in the News Letter opinion<br />\nsection entitled, \"The DODJHU-APL Triangle.\" They saw<br />\nno need to further explain their<br />\nposition.<br />\nAccording to them, many<br />\ngroups are actively involved in<br />\nworking to change APL for more<br /><br />\nhumanitarian research: among<br />\nothers, the Physicians for Social<br />\nResponsibility, the Howard<br />\nCounty SANE, VIVA [the<br />\nCatholic Worker], Atlantic Life<br />\nCommunity, Citizens Against the<br />\nPershing and Cruise Missiles, and<br />\nthe Independent Project for Conversion of the APL.<br />\nThey indicated that their actions were open and had to be interpreted in the light of past<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nIn October 1986, they presented University President<br />\nSteven Muller and an APL official with a \"cornucopia\" of toy<br />\nweapons to represent \"the gifts<br />\nthey were giving to the world.\"<br />\nMuller also received a papiermache turkey.<br />\nIronically, he later proceeded<br />\nto display this turkey as a<br />\n\"trophy,\" potentially suggesting<br />\nthat he did not take the situation<br />\nall that seriously, the protesters<br />\ncontended. The trio likened that<br />\nto \"hanging up a bloody knife.\"<br />\nIn November, they wanted to<br />\npour human blood on this turkey<br />\nas part of their \"Bread Not<br />\nBombs\" demonstration.<br />\nAfter a complicated series of<br />\nevents, Ashera-Davis and<br />\nKramer entered Muller's office<br />\nbut were unable to locate the<br />\nturkey. Heid accompanied them<br />\nto distract Muller's secretaries.<br />\nThey produced a facsimile of the<br />\nturkey, placed it in a metal tray,<br />\nand proceeded to pour blood on<br />\nit, as well as on other items on the<br />\ndesk.<br /><br />\n\"This is just like the protesters<br />\nwho put homemade napalm on<br />\ndraft-cards because they thought<br />\nthey were hunting licenses,\" said<br />\nHeid. He suggested \"if they were<br />\nletters or documents about<br />\nDefense, then the blood was symbolically already on them.\"<br />\nThe group had expected the<br />\npresence of the press or at least<br />\nsome evidence that it was concerned and had contacted the<br />\nUniversity. No such evidence<br />\nwas present, suggested AsheraDavis, because \"there are ties<br />\nbetween Hopkins and the<br />\nBaltimore Sun. Hopkins practically owns this town.\"<br />\nShe cited as evidence the attorneys who, after the group's arrest, could not represent them<br />\nbecause of conflict of interest<br />\narising from legal work done on<br />\nthe University's behalf.<br />\n\"The trial involved some blatant misinformation, because<br />\nHopkins placed the damage<br />\nestimate at about $3,500, and<br />\nlater lowered this by about<br />\n$1,000 after we contested it,\"<br />\nthey said.<br />\nThe first prosecutor had to drop<br />\nthe case on reasons of personal<br />\nconscience since he was a fundamentalist Christian and \"felt<br />\nthat we were basically decent<br />\npeople even if he couldn't agree<br />\nwith us.\" During the trial, he<br />\nsupposedly tried to subpoena<br />\nMuller, but Muller refused to appear since he did not feel he<br />\nwould need to appear as a<br />\nmaterial witness, said the<br /><br />\n1111<br />\nWHILE ITS HOT<br /><br />\nThe APL Chain of Command<br /><br />\nORGANIZATION CHART<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nBOARD OF TRUSTEES<br />\nCOMMITTEE ON THE APPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT<br />\nAdv,sory Board<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY<br />\nDIRECTOR<br />\nASSOCIATE DIRECTOR<br />\nDirector of Personnel<br />\nProgram Offices<br />\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR, Researcb<br />\nand Exploratory Development<br />\n\u2014 Laboratory Counsel<br />\nBiomedical Programs\u2014<br />\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR,<br />\n\u2014 Director of APL Education Center<br />\nLaboratory Operations<br />\nWarfare Systems Architecture \u2014<br />\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR,<br />\nand Engineering Office<br />\n\u2014 Chile Scientist<br />\nBusiness Operations<br />\nCONTROLLER<br /><br />\nAERONAUTICS<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nRESEARCH<br />\nCENTER<br /><br />\nNAVAL<br />\nWARFARE<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nSPACE<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nFLEET SYSTEMS<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nBUSINESS<br />\nSYSTEMS<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nTECHNICAL<br />\nSERVICES<br />\nDEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nPervonnel<br />\n&amp; Education<br />\nBrand'<br /><br />\nprotesters.<br />\nThe statute that the trio violated<br />\ncarries a possibility of three<br />\nyears' imprisonment.

The<br />\ncode would place the primary burden of<br />\nmaintaining an ethical academic atmosphere on the students; we would be<br />\nresponsiblefor reporting infractions ofthe<br />\ncode. Offenders wouldface a trial by peers.<br />\nAn honor code would replace the Ethics<br />\nBoard, consisting of both faculty and<br />\nstudents, which currently monitors ethical<br /><br />\nstandards at Hopkins.<br />\nThe moral questions surrounding a<br />\npotential honor code are difficult ones.<br />\nCheating, in particular, is difficult to<br />\ndefine, and variesfrom class to class. And<br />\nyet, under a code, a student would be expected to control cheating as he saw it with<br />\n\"less prominent\" input from the faculty.<br />\nThe following editorial, taken from the<br />\nDecember 9, 1983 News-Letter, only<br />\nbegins to demonstrate the complexity and<br />\ntimelessness of this issue.<br /><br />\n\"The professor once gave out blue books<br />\nthat were shorter than the ones they sell in<br />\nthe bookstore.\"<br />\n\"Really?\"<br />\nIt was pretty funny. The next day, at the<br />\nbeginning of lecture, he stood at the front<br />\nof the room with the blue books piled in<br />\na stack. And then he did it.\"<br />\n\"Did what?\"<br />\n\"He stood them up on the desk, took out<br />\nthe longer ones, and called out the names.\"<br />\n\"What happened to them?\"<br />\n\"I don't know.\"<br />\n\"You're lying.\"<br />\n\"No, I'm not.\"<br />\n\"Since when do professors care if<br />\nstudents cheat? I've seen plenty of people<br />\ncheat, and the profesoor or the TA just sits<br />\nthere reading a newspaper or something.\"<br />\n\"What kind of cheating are you talking<br />\nabout?\"<br />\n\"What do you mean what kind? I thought<br />\nthere's only one kind.\"<br />\n\"There's more than one. What you're<br />\ntalking about is the dependent type. You<br />\nsee, there are two kinds. Dependent and independent, dependent probably being more<br />\ncommon.\"<br />\n\"Dependent, independent. What the<br />\nhell's your problem?\"<br />\n\"Are you familiar with Mole Cell<br />\nexams?\"<br />\n\"What about them?\"<br />\n\"Part of the class takes the exam in Mudd<br />\nwhile the other part takes it in Remsen.\"<br />\n\"So?\"<br />\n\"A few weeks ago, before a Mole Cell<br />\nexam, a few TA's walked over to a student<br />\nin Mudd and escorted him out.\"<br />\n\"Why?\"<br />\n\"He was supposed to be in Remsen.\"<br />\n\"And you think he was in Mudd because<br />\nhe was going to cheat off someone?\"<br />\n\"I'm not saying a word.\"<br />\n\"But how'd the TA's know he was in<br /><br />\nMudd?\"<br />\n\"Some students must have told them. Let<br />\nme put it another way. I think some students<br />\nwere seeing him get away with it too<br />\noften.\"<br />\n\"Did anything happen to him?\"<br />\n\"I don't know. But the professor came<br />\ninto Mudd before the exam and told<br />\neveryone to make sure their books were<br />\nbelow their desks. It was ironic in a way.<br />\nA couple days before, he said some TV station wanted to film the class while they<br />\nwere taking the exam. But he told them that<br />\nthe exam was more than enough for the<br />\nstudents to worry about. God, that<br />\nwould've been funny. Having that whole<br />\nscene appearing on TV for all of Baltimore<br />\nto see.\"<br />\n\"So that's dependent cheating then?\"<br />\n\"It could've been. Anyone who uses<br />\nanyone else to improve an exam grade is<br />\ncheating dependently.\"<br />\n\"Does that also include the case where<br />\nthe relationship is not agreed upon before<br />\nthe exam?\"<br />\n\"Yes.\"<br />\n\"So what's independent cheating?\"<br />\n\"Exactly what it says. Let's say someone's taking a calc exam. He brings in<br />\na blue book and on the last page is a bunch<br />\nof formulae. He uses them during the exam, but before he walks out of the room,<br />\nhe rips out the last page and the TA doesn't<br />\nknow the difference. But that's the dumb<br />\nway. It's much better just to stick a piece<br />\nof paper in the back of the blue book and<br />\ntake it out after the exam. You should try<br />\nit some time. Blue book exams could be a<br />\nlot of fun.\"<br />\n\"What?\"<br />\n\"Sure. Sometimes independent cheating<br />\ncan be more challenging than taking the exam. But that seldom happens.

However, the methods<br />\nhe used to gain information for<br />\nthis article were somewhat questionable. Instead of interviewing<br />\nus, the newly-appointed chairmen<br />\nof Spring Fair, the author of the<br />\narticle chose instead to walk into<br />\nthe Student Council Office and<br />\nrequest our applications from the<br />\nperson sitting there. The Student<br />\nCouncil member in the office at<br />\nthat time chose to hand them right<br />\nover to Jon. This incident alarmed us for several reasons. One, if<br />\nCouncil's policy is that the applications of people applying for<br />\nvarious positions are available to<br />\nthe public and particularly to the<br />\nNews-Letter, then the applicants<br />\nshould certainly be made aware<br />\nof that fact prior to turning in any<br />\napplication, or the application<br />\nitself should have a note to that<br />\neffect.

Due to the<br />\ndissemination of literature and<br />\nother information, however, the<br />\npopularity of study abroad programs has increased significantly. Last year a total of fifty \"Hoppies\" were scattered about the<br />\nglobe.<br />\nSince University policy does<br />\nnot strictly designate approval to<br />\nonly certain programs, students<br />\nare allowed much latitude when<br />\nselecting<br />\ncourse.<br />\na<br />\n\"It's about discovery,\" states<br />\nDr. Evans. \"The selection of a<br />\nprogram requires self-examination<br />\ntion of one's goals, and the programs can also play a fundamental role in shaping a career.\"<br />\nThe growth in the number of<br />\nstudents abroad provided senior<br />\nAlex Parikh, who studied abroad<br />\nduring his junior year, with the<br />\nidea of generating a group to ac-<br /><br />\ncomplish three main goals. The<br />\nfirst is to reach out to those interested in study abroad programs, the second is to provide<br />\nsupport for returning students,<br />\nand the last is to keep in contact<br />\nwith those who are temporarily<br />\naway from the Hopkins community. The Study Abroad<br />\nForum, as the group is called, is<br />\nsponsored by Academic Advising<br />\nbut is largely student-run.<br />\n\"I would like to see it student<br />\nrun in order to meet the need of<br />\nthe students,\" said Dr. Evans.<br />\nSome of the immediate aims of<br />\nthe group are to compile a directory of returning students and to<br />\npublish a \"how to\" booklet with<br />\nhelpful hints to those going<br />\nabroad. In order to keep in contact with students currently out of<br />\nthe country, the group also plans<br />\nto mail out News-Letter snapshots of life at Hopkins. _<br />\nAnother benefit of the Forum<br />\nhas been the creation of weekly<br />\ngroup meetings with Dr. Evans<br />\nand a returning Hopkins student<br />\nfor those who are interested in ex-<br /><br />\nEly Brown<br /><br />\nSenior Alex Parikh, who studied abroad last year, conceived the Study Abroad Forum<br />\nto provide students<br />\nwith help in pursuing their academics overseas.<br />\nploring the possibility of foreign<br />\nstudy. Scheduled on Tuesday<br />\nafternoons at 3:30 p.m. and Friday mornings at 10:00 a.m., the<br />\nmeetings provide interaction with<br />\na student experienced in selecting<br />\na suitable program.<br />\nDiane Fernbach, a senior returning from a Parliamentary internship in London, eagerly recommends study abroad. She also<br />\nsaid that the Study Abroad Forum<br />\n\"brings students together in order<br />\nto share their experiences.\"<br />\nAfter sitting in on one of the<br />\ngroup sessions, interested<br />\nstudents have three other<br /><br />\nreference sources available to<br />\nthem in Academic Advising: collected pamphlets from various<br />\nprograms, independent references that work with these programs listed by country, and<br />\nquestionnaires completed by students who have returned.<br />\nOnce a student has chosen prospective programs, applied, and<br />\nreceived acceptances, the student<br />\nthen decides which program is<br />\nmost conducive to fulfilling his<br />\nidentified goals. After completing<br />\nthe necessary paperwork and conferring with a faculty advisor, the<br />\nstudent is granted a leave of<br /><br />\nabsence by the University. Application deadlines for the spring<br />\nsemester usually fall in October<br />\nand November, while the<br />\ndeadlines for most programs<br />\nbeginning in the fall semester are<br />\nin March.<br />\nDesigned as a service for<br />\nstudents<br />\ninterested<br />\nin<br />\nforeign study, the Study Abroad<br />\nForum is a source of invaluable<br />\ninformation.

Most of the<br />\nchanges director William Foeller<br />\nhas chosen for his production are<br />\nin the set and the staging of the<br />\nplay. and while these alterations<br />\nare innovative and at times<br />\nenlightening, they are a serious<br />\nand potentially dangerous departure from Shepard's carefully<br />\nwoven fabric of dialogue and<br />\nstage directions.<br />\nThe battle between director and<br />\nplaywright\u2014which one has the<br />\nfinal word\u2014dates way back. But<br />\nin most of Shepard's older plays,<br />\nsuch as Fool for Love, it is important to question why the stage<br />\ndirections are so detailed.<br />\nShepard fits these details into the<br />\nplay like puzzle pieces, building<br />\na whole, and if any of the pieces<br />\nare missing or changed, then in<br />\na small way the play itself is incomplete or altered. Foeller is obviously aware of this danger, and<br />\nhis new ideas of set and staging<br />\nare an attempt to substitute the<br />\npieces with different ones, and<br />\nones that fit. Some of them do,<br />\nsome of them don't.<br />\nIn the original set design, for<br />\nexample, Shepard describes the<br />\n\"stark, low rent motel room on<br />\nthe edge of the Mojave Desert.<br />\nFaded green plaster walls. Dark<br />\nbrown linoleum floor. No rugs.\"<br />\nThe impression that the audience<br />\nshould receive is one of confinement and desolation, the small,<br />\ncramped room embodying the<br />\nemotionally escapeless situation<br />\nof Eddie and May. Foeller chose<br />\nto construct the walls of cinder<br />\nblock, echoing a prison cell, and<br />\nit works beautifully. The dirt<br />\nfloor also works well\u2014the barren<br />\nexpanse of the Mojave Desert,<br />\nperhaps the ultimate fence, is not<br />\njust hinted at outside the motel,<br />\nit is actually in the room with<br />\nthem. This adds a new dimension<br />\nto the moments in which Eddie<br />\nand May roll around on the sandy floor; they are no longer simply releasing emotion in a physical<br />\nfight, they are struggling in the<br />\ndirt that they know convention<br />\nhas defined as their relationship,<br />\nthe kind of residue that cannot be<br />\nbrushed off.<br />\nTrue to the intentions of the<br />\nplay, Foeller has also pushed the<br />\nentire set disarmingly close to the<br />\nedge of the stage, giving it a<br />\ncagey feel, and leaving little room<br />\nfor the characters to move<br />\naround. For the audience, the<br />\nshort stage places them almost inside the room with the characters,<br />\nthe earth-like floor even extending over the stage and into the<br />\ntheater itself. At times some of us<br />\nhad to be careful of the dirt which<br />\nflew across the front rows, or the<br />\ntequila that flew from the glasses.<br />\nThe intimacy of this set is certainly effective.<br />\nSome of the set does not work<br />\nas well. The walls are cut-offjust<br />\nabove the actors' heads, only<br />\nopening up the room. The pur-<br /><br />\npose of the short walls, it should<br />\nbe noted, is to accommodate the<br />\nrusty, broken down Plymouth on<br />\ntop of the set, where the character<br />\nof The Old Man sits, drinks, and<br />\ncomments on the situation. This<br />\nplacement is also a mistake. The<br />\nOld Man may be only inside the<br />\nheads of Eddie and May, but<br />\nShepard wanted him onstage in a<br />\nrocking chair, with the other<br />\ncharacters, the division of reality and fantasy completely broken<br />\ndown. By setting The Old Man<br />\nabove the action, Foeller immediately swings the balance in<br />\nfavor of fantasy. Even as The Old<br />\nMan moves about the characters<br />\nlater, it is too late to instill that<br />\nsense of uncertainty and the<br />\nsuspension of conventional notions of continuity which are a<br />\nShepard mark. The old<br />\nPlymouth, though an important<br />\nsymbol of the play and visually<br />\nspectacular, was never meant to<br />\nbe seen. The past is as real and<br />\nalive as the present in this play,<br />\nthe continuum of time and place<br />\nerased. The rusty heap before our<br />\neyes seems a contradiction, an<br />\nimage of a disintegrating and distant past.<br />\nThe lighting has also been<br />\naltered. Instead of surreal<br />\nheadlights cutting through the<br />\nwindows and doors of the room<br />\nat crucial moments in the play,<br />\nthe lights often come from the audience, which is less effective and<br />\ndoesn't make much sense. Again,<br />\nthe room seemed more open and<br />\nairy than it should have been.<br />\nThere were also too many<br />\ndoors; instead of one exterior and<br />\na bathroom door, there were four<br />\ndoors leading outside the motel<br />\nroom. One could argue that May<br />\nand Eddie's inability to escape, to<br />\nleave each other once and for all,<br />\ncomes from deep within their<br />\nhearts and a thousand doors<br />\nwould not make a difference. But<br />\nthe magic of Shepard is the<br />\npowerful translation of emotion<br />\nand situation into a complete<br />\ntheater experience, an attack on<br />\nall our senses which makes it<br />\n\"theater\" instead of staged<br />\ndialogue.<br />\nBut dialogue is just as important. Phyllis Lyons, who plays<br />\nMay, does a terrific job exploring the subtext of her character.<br />\nShe is a smart-ass, but under that<br />\nwe get a real sense of May as a<br />\nvictim\u2014of Fate, of her own<br />\ndesires, of Eddie, whom she hates<br />\nand loves with equal passion.<br />\nPeter Crombie is also cast well as<br />\nthe cowboy Eddie, although he is<br />\na little too charming. Eddie is as<br />\npractical as he is idealistic, as antagonistic as he is vulnerable, as<br />\nnoncommittal as he is devoted. He<br />\nis a mass of contradictions. Too<br />\nfew times did Crombie delve into the dark side of Eddie, the<br />\nmenacing half that enjoys conflict, who's pent-up emotions are<br />\nbarely reined. But the chemistry between Lyons and<br />\nCrombie is palpable, and Foeller<br />\nutilizes it to move the story with<br />\npowerful force.<br />\nAs far as the minor characters<br />\ngo, if there is such a thing in a<br />\nShepard play, George Bamford is<br />\nan honestly believable Martin, the<br />\nsimple man who comes to the<br />\nmotel to pick up May for a date<br /><br />\nand winds up as the backboard for<br />\nEddie and May's verbal games.<br />\nHe is confused, horrified,<br />\nbizarrely intrigued by the story,<br />\na member of the audience right on<br />\nstage voicing our own bewilderment: \"What the hell is happening here?\" William Hardy is also<br />\ngood as The Old Man, though it<br />\ntakes him a little while to warm<br />\nup, about the time he has more<br />\ndialogue and less sitting around<br />\non top of the set. But when he<br />\ngets rolling, he takes the part and<br />\nruns with it.<br />\nDespite the strengths of the per-<br /><br />\nformances, some of the changes<br />\nFoeller has made outside of the<br />\ndialogue remain questionable. He<br />\nremoves many of the directions<br />\nShepard included towards the end<br />\nof the play, directions that are<br />\ncrucial to the play's resolution.<br />\nGone are many of the lighting and<br />\nsound effects, such as the \"loud<br />\ncollision, shattering glass, and explosion. Bright orange and blue<br />\nlights of a gasoline fire.. .sounds<br />\nof horses screaming wildly,<br />\nhooves galloping on pavement.\"<br />\nShepard had important reasons<br />\nfor putting them in, and it's<br /><br />\nunclear why Foeller opted to ignore them. The explosion, the<br />\nscreaming horses, the final image<br />\nof the glowing fire slowly fading<br />\nto black all indicate some kind of<br />\napocalypse. But it is an ambiguous ending. Do these images<br />\nrepresent a relationship finally<br />\nshattered by the revelation and<br />\nconfrontation of the truth of its<br />\norigin? Or are they a symbol of<br />\na love that is somehow purged by<br />\na consuming self-destruction,<br />\ngiving it the chance to rebuild in<br />\nSee FOOL, 16<br /><br />\nDrinking poetry at the Pearl<br />\nby Ciaran Blumenfeld<br />\nMencken's Cultured Pearl Cafe<br />\n1114 Hollins St., 837-1947<br />\nYou may want to call for directions on this one, but if you can<br />\nfind your way there, Mencken's<br />\nis worth checking out at least once<br />\nonce while you're still here.

Regardless of<br />\nyour position on the \"nature versus nurture\" debate, you cannot<br />\ndeny the influence on everything<br />\nfrom health to intelligence. Dr.<br />\nVictor McKusick, director of the<br />\nMedical Genetics department at<br />\nJHMI, delivered a lecture to<br />\nFriends of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nLibraries about how scientists are<br />\npinpointing the locations of the<br />\ngenes that determine who we are.<br />\nMcKusick explained that the<br />\nhuman genome is the \"information system for how we<br />\ndevelop.\" It is the collection of<br />\nsomewhere between 50,000 to<br />\n100,000 genes. Genes are found<br />\nin the nuclei of cells, on structures commonly known as<br />\nchromosomes. Humans have 23<br />\nchromosomes. To map the human<br />\ngenome means to locate the genes<br />\nresponsible for genetic diseases,<br />\nskin color, and other traits on particular parts along one of the 23<br />\nchromosomes. These locations<br />\nare common to all human beings,<br />\nbut the structure of the genes<br />\nvaries and produces unique<br />\npeople.<br />\nSeveral characteristics in<br />\nhuman beings have been traced<br />\nback to a genetic cause.<br />\nMcKusick is the editor of the<br />\ndefinitive catalog of these known<br />\ngenes, \"Moundelian Inheritance in<br />\nMan (MIM)\", which is in its<br />\neighth edition and is available on<br />\ndatabase from the Welch Medical<br /><br />\nLibrary. As of his lecture, 4534<br />\ngenetically-determined characteristics were listed on the<br />\nMIM database. Of these 4534<br />\ngenes, 1450 had been mapped to<br />\na certain location along one of the<br />\n23 chromosomes.<br />\nThe first genes ever mapped<br />\nwere located on chromosome 23.<br />\nChromosome 23 is different from<br />\nthe other chromosomes since it is<br />\nthe sex chromosome. One X<br />\ncomponent and one Y component<br />\nmake a male, and two X components determine a female. Obviously, the Y does not determine<br />\nthe same traits as the X. Traits on<br />\nthe other 22 chromosomes are<br />\nfound on both components in both<br />\nsexes. Males have only one X<br />\ncomponent\u2014whatever trait it<br />\ncodes for cannot be counteracted<br />\nby the Y component. In females,<br />\nhowever, one gene may be on and<br />\nthe other off, producing a half<br />\ndose, or both may be on or off.<br />\nGenes on the X component exhibit a distinct pattern of inheritance called X-linkage. Thus,<br />\nby studying pedigrees, genes can<br />\nbe mapped to the X component.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has always been<br />\non the forefront of the genemapping effort. In 1911, E.B.<br />\nWilson, a Hopkins doctoral candidate, succeeded in mapping the<br />\nfirst gene, the red-green colorblindness gene, to chromosome<br />\n23. He saw that women were<br />\nrarely color-blind. Mom's dad<br />\ngave her his X component, making her a carrier. She had a 50<br /><br />\npercent chance of giving her son<br />\nher X with color-blindness.<br />\nWhere color-blindness ran in<br />\nfamilies, Wilson found that it exactly followed this X-linkage<br />\npattern.<br />\nX-linked genes were the only<br />\nones that could be mapped for<br />\nseveral decades. However, new<br />\nisolating<br />\nfor<br />\ntechniques<br />\nchromosomes and examining<br />\nthem led to another breakthrough<br />\nby another Hopkins Ph.D. candidate. In 1968, Roger Donahue<br />\nexamined his own chromosomes,<br />\nand found that his chromosome 1<br />\nwas abnormal. He examined his<br />\nrelatives' chromosomes and<br />\nfound the same defect in some of<br />\nthem. He searched for a<br />\ncharacteristic that they all shared,<br />\nand realized that all had the same<br />\nDuffy blood type.<br />\nChromosomes are made of<br />\nstrands of protein and DNA.<br />\nDNA is a huge molecule that is<br />\ncomposed of 4 subunits referred<br />\nto as bases, and symbolized as<br />\nG(guanine), A(adenosine),<br />\nT(tyrosine), and C(cytosine). The<br />\nsequence of bases is critical, as it<br />\ndetermines what proteins the<br />\nDNA codes for, which determine<br />\nthe traits found in people. One<br />\ngene codes for one protein.<br />\nHopkins also rides the crest of<br />\nnew technologies for sequencing<br />\nDNA.<br />\nIn 1978, Hopkins molecular<br />\nbiologists Hamilton Smith and<br />\nDan Nathan shared a Nobel Prize<br />\nfor their use of restriction en-<br /><br />\nzymes to sequence DNA. These<br />\nare proteins which cut DNA only at specific sites. EcoRI, a widely used restriction enzyme, cuts<br />\nafter the guanine in the series<br />\nGTAAC. By exposing many<br />\ncopies of the same molecule of<br />\nDNA to several different restriction enzymes, Smith and Nathan<br />\nwere able to determine some of<br />\nthe sequence of that DNA.<br />\nSequencing the human genome<br />\nis an immense task. McKusick<br />\nestimates that to list all of the<br />\nthree billion base pairs in one<br />\nhuman being's genome, just by<br />\nG, T, A, or C, would require a<br />\nlibrary equivalent to thirteen sets<br />\nof the Encyclopaedia Britannica.<br />\nStill, it is worth the effort.<br />\nResearch on genetic diseases like<br />\nAlzheimer's Disease was stalled.<br />\nScientists knew there was a<br />\ngenetic link, but they did not<br />\nknow which gene was responsialleged<br />\nNow, the<br />\nble.<br />\nAlzheimer's gene has been mapped.

The Blue Jays, however,<br />\nstruck right back.<br />\nHopkins began the ensuing<br />\ndrive at their own 25-yard line<br />\nwith an all-senior backfield led by<br />\nquarterback Gary Rupert. Brian<br />\nDulin, who needed 111 yards going into the game to become the<br /><br />\nsecond leading rusher in<br />\nHopkins's history, pounded<br />\nthrough the Green Terror defense<br />\nas the Jays moved the ball to the<br />\nWestern Maryland 12-yard line<br />\nAfter converting on two fourthand-one plays, Dulin finally<br />\nscored on a one-yard plunge to tie<br />\nthe game at 7-7.<br />\nLate in the second quarter.<br />\nHopkins was able to take advantage of Steve Davis's interception<br />\nof a Joe Faber pass at the Hopkins<br />\n40. Once again, the Jays ran<br />\nthrough the Green Terror<br />\ndefense, only this time it was<br />\nsenior Chris Chirieleison who<br />\nscored on a 6-yard run to put<br />\nHopkins in front 14-7.<br />\nMuch of the crowd at<br />\nHomewood field remained<br />\npessimistic at halftime, even<br />\nthough the Blue Jays had a 14-7<br />\nlead. After all, Hopkins hadn't<br />\nscored in the third quarter all<br />\nseason and always seemed to find<br />\na way to give the game away in<br />\nthe second half. But as two teams<br />\nran onto the field at the start of<br />\nthe third quarter, you could tell<br />\nthat Hopkins wasn't going to let<br />\nthis one slip away.

With around five<br />\nminutes to play, the Green Terrors drove 68 yards to the<br />\nHopkins 12-yard line. The Blue<br />\nJays, however, tightened up and<br />\nheld Western Maryland on a<br />\nfourth-and-two to take over the<br />\nball. But after the offense once<br />\nagain was forced to punt, the<br />\ndefense was put right back on the<br />\nfield as the Green Terrors took<br />\nover on the Hopkins 40-yard line<br />\nwith three minutes to play.<br />\nWestern Maryland moved the ball<br />\nquickly to the four yard-line<br />\nwhere they were given four shots<br />\nat scoring. They tried running<br />\nFrees to the outside, but Brian<br />\nHepting and Joe Sokolowski were<br />\nthere to cut off the plays for no<br />\ngain. After a failed pass, the<br />\ngame came down to a last fourth<br />\ndown play. Terror quarterback<br />\nJoe Faber lofted a pass across the<br />\nmiddle of the end zone, but it<br />\nlanded right in the arms of Brian<br />\nHepting to seal the victory for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"This win meant a hell of a lot<br />\nto the seniors,\" said Fenzel.<br />\n\"This is the game that will stick<br /><br />\nwith us the rest of our lives. It<br />\ntakes some of the sting out of losing the other ones.\"<br />\nMaybe some of the sting, but<br />\ndefinitely not all of it. The 1988<br />\nseason was a definite disappointment for the Blue Jays. With a<br />\nstrong crop of freshmen and a<br />\ngreat group of returning players,<br />\nHopkins had high expectations<br />\ngoing into the season. So what<br />\nhappened?<br />\nThe biggest problem with the<br />\nJays this season was the slow<br />\nstart. The first five games were<br />\nones that Hopkins definitely could<br />\nhave won, but offensive problems<br />\nkept coach Jerry Pfeifer's team<br />\nwinless. The main cause of these<br />\nproblems were at quarterback.<br />\nThe Blue Jays switched to a<br />\nwishbone offense at the beginning of the season, an offense<br />\nwhich relies heavily on a good<br />\noption quarterback. The decision<br />\nto change the offense, however,<br />\nmay have been a hasty one,<br />\nbecause Hopkins didn't have a<br />\nquarterback with the quickness or<br />\noption experience to run the<br />\nwishbone. Offensive problems<br />\nwere further complicated by the<br />\nsee FOOTBALL, 22<br /><br />\nBasketball tips off tomorrow<br /><br />\nMen's and Women's<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nwere obviously more fired up<br />\nthan the Green Terrors.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense once<br />\nagain sputtered in the third<br />\nquarter, as Western Maryland put<br />\neight men on the line in an attempt to slow the Blue Jays running attack. Gary Rupert was<br />\nunable to open up the airways, as<br />\nhe was pressured into rushing his<br />\nthrows and missing open men.<br />\nDulin was frustrated for almost<br />\nall of the second half, as he finished the day with 92 yards on 22<br />\ncarries and fell just short of moving up on the all-time rushing list.<br />\nBut it really didn't matter if the<br />\nJays scored any more points,<br />\nbecause as the game progressed,<br />\nit became increasingly obvious<br />\nthat the defense was not going to<br />\nlet the Green Terrors score.<br />\nCharles Johnson-Bey, the senior<br />\nlinebacker, was all over the field<br />\nand kept Frees from getting outside where he could do the most<br />\ndamage. Mike Fenzel, playing at<br />\ndefensive tackle for much of the<br />\ngame due to injuries on the line,<br />\nalso did an excellent job of containing Frees, and he constantly<br />\napplied pressure when Western<br />\nMaryland tried to pass.

Donnelley has been a nice<br />\nsurprise for Coach Blank this<br />\nseason. She has practiced well<br />\nthis fall and is a welcome<br />\naddition to the starting<br />\nline up.

According to her<br />\ncoach, Hourigan is<br />\nmuch improved<br />\nover<br />\nlast<br /><br />\nseason, and will see a lot of time as a<br />\nreserve player in the swing guard position.<br />\nAnother player who will be seeing a lot<br />\nof floor time this season is freshman recruit<br />\nKelly Van Houten. This 5' 11\" forward<br />\nfrom Little Fall, New Jersey, is a strong<br />\nathlete who suffered an injury in her senior<br />\nyear of high school, preventing her from<br />\nplaying Division I ball.

Hopkins's top three players are<br />\nreturning to the court, and third year coach<br />\nNancy Blank has high expectations for her<br />\nyoung team. \"Although we are young, we<br />\nexpect a lot from the sophomore recruits.<br />\nWe anticipate an over .500 season, which<br />\nhasn't been done by a Hopkins women's<br />\nteam in recent years.\"<br />\nThe Lady Jays lost three players from<br />\nlast year's 8-12 team to graduation. Laura<br />\nPorter (8.2 points per game), Jeanne Clark<br />\n(4 points per game), and Cindy Harper<br />\n(8.9 points per game) will be missed largely in terms of leadership.<br />\nHopkins is in a transitional period this<br />\nseason. The entire team is composed of<br />\nfreshman and sophomores, which, according to Coach Blank, \"will be a factor in<br />\nterms of leadership.\"<br />\nTaking over the leadership role will be<br />\na trio of seasoned sophomores. Forward<br />\nco-captain Kristi Kantowski, a 5' 11\"<br />\nsophomore from Ellicott City, Maryland,<br />\nled the team in scoring last season with a<br />\nfourteen point average. Kantowski also<br />\npulled down 6.1 rebounds per game and<br />\nis the glue of this young team. She is the<br />\nmotivational factor on the team according<br />\nto her coach. Blank has adjusted the team's<br />\noffense to make Kristi more of a scoring<br />\nthreat.<br />\nSophomore co-captain Julianne Rolapp<br />\nled last year's team in assists with 45 and<br />\nin three point shots, scoring on 41 percent<br />\nof her attempts from beyond the 19' 9\"<br />\narc. This 5'5\" point guard from Dames-town, Maryland, also averaged 9.6<br />\npoints per game and, as primary ball<br />\nhandler, will take over the leadership role<br />\non the floor.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins 1988-89 Women's Basketball Team<br /><br />\nDavid Preece<br /><br />\nYork, has been steadily improving this fall<br />\nand has been a nice surprise for Coach<br />\nBlank. According to Kantowski, \"the new<br />\nfreshmen will help us out a lot this<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nThe 1988-89 team will very likely he the<br />\ngrace the courts at JHU. They are a quick<br />\nteam with a lot of confidence in one<br />\nanother. The Lady Jays' speed in the open<br />\ncourt will make up for their lack of height<br />\nand should account for a lot of scoring opportunities this season. This quickness<br />\nshould help out on the season opener on<br />\nSaturday against the University of<br />\nChicago, which boasts three girls over 6'<br />\nin their line up. This 6:00 game should be<br />\na battle on the boards but Coach Blank is<br />\nexpecting to pull out a win by running on<br />\ntheir less agile opponents. Co-captain<br />\nRolapp anticipates success as well. \"We<br />\ndefinitely have improved over last season.<br />\nThis may be the first time that the girl's<br />\nteam could have a winning reputation .\"<br />\nThis season marks Hopkins's true arrival<br />\ninto UAA basketball. Hopkins has been<br />\nranked fifth in the preliminary rankings,<br />\nbut the differences between the top five are<br />\nrelatively insignificant. Hopkins will be<br />\nmaking five road trips this winter, which<br />\nis a lot of travelling in comparison to recent years. This could bring a fatigue factor into play as the season draws to a close.<br />\nCo-captain Kantowski is enthusiastic about<br />\nthe upcoming trips. \"It [the season] will<br />\nbe really exciting with all of the travelling<br />\nwe will be doing. \"<br />\nCoach Blanck, a seasoned veteran with<br />\na 130-102 career record, will be assisted<br />\nby Maureen McHugh, now in her third<br />\nseason with the Jays.

Or,<br />\nthey're fighting the memory of<br />\nseveral blissful moments of REM<br />\nsleep caught earlier on a table top<br />\nat the Hut. Members of the crew<br />\nregularly and willingly submit<br />\nthemselves to the kind of healththreatening activities which their<br />\nmothers used to warn them about.<br />\nAt 5 a.m. on a cold, rainy, and<br />\npredictably dark morning, the only act which seems to approach<br />\nrationality is to take some aspirin<br />\nand get back into bed. Rowers,<br />\nhowever, free of such encumbering thoughts, do power strokes<br />\naround the oily harbor while<br />\nwearing lycra shorts and enormous, silly-looking plastic<br />\nsneakers. It can test one's corncommitment. It can also create winning boats.<br />\nThe Hopkins crew is seeing the<br />\nresults of its labor. The program<br />\nis growing and improving. Returning rowers are fine-tuning their<br />\ntechnique and building speed and<br />\nendurance and are thus becoming<br />\nincreasingly competitive with<br />\nother crews. Schools which used<br />\nto be beyond Hopkins's range are<br />\nlosing their lead.

So, to recap the early playoff action: Vincent/Willard<br />\nsqueaked out a victory over<br />\nAdams 15-13; Hollander<br />\ncrushed McCoy 26-0; Gildersleeve beat Royce/Sylvester<br />\n26-13; and Baker defeated Wood<br />\n13-6.<br />\nOn to new business. Today is<br />\nSuper Bowl Friday. The dorm<br />\nchampionship will be played at 3<br />\np.m. WAWA meets Phi Psi for<br />\nthe Division I title at 4 p.m. and<br />\nthe Division II championship is<br />\nalso at 4 p.m. You don't want to<br />\nmiss these games (unless, like<br />\nme, you're going to be in California for the USC-UCLA game).<br />\nGames will be played rain or<br />\nshine. The winners will receive<br />\nBIA shirts.<br />\nThe results of the exciting pingpong tournament are in. Phi Psi<br />\nbeat WAWA in the finals. In the<br />\ndorms, Pat Chang (Vincent/Willard) won it all. McCoy,<br />\nClark, and Building A finished<br />\n2,3,4.<br />\nThe volleyball results are being<br />\ntabulated.

WAWA has<br />\n95, but won 3 on 3, and is a heavy<br />\nfavorite in football. Look for<br />\nthem to make it a tight 3-way race<br />\nfor the trophy.<br />\nAny questions this week?

Hopkins<br />\nboats are outrowing boats that used to leave us in their wakes. This<br />\nseason's novices, who use the fall<br />\nseason to learn the basics of rowing, are turning out to be<br />\nthreatening for other crews and<br />\nlook to be a solid base for future<br />\nvarsity boats. Captains John<br />\nFaulkingham of the men's team<br />\nand Kelly Kieffer of the women's<br />\nhave, through the several coxswains, shaped the form and synchronized the timing of the<br />\nrowers. This process, although<br />\nfar from complete, has given the<br />\noarspersons victories which the<br />\nforce of uncontrolled pull would<br />\nnot. As the rowers individually<br />\ncontinue to develop finesse, more<br />\nvictories from their shells are<br />\nexpected.<br />\nThe crew season opened on<br />\nSeptember 9th at the King's Head<br />\nRegatta on the Schuykill River in<br />\nPennsylvania. The Men's Varsity Lightweight Four, the only<br />\nHopkins boat entered, captured<br />\nfirst in their race. Hopkins's next<br />\nraces were at the Head of the<br />\nPotomac in Georgetown, where<br />\nthe same Lightweight Four finished ahead of all other Lightweight<br />\ncrews in a race dominated by<br />\nHeavyweights. The other crews<br />\nentered in the regatta represented<br />\nolder and much better-financed<br />\nprograms than that of Hopkins.<br />\nYet Hopkins pulled a respectable<br />\nshowing, with the Women's Varsity Eight only twenty-four<br />\nseconds behind such competition.<br />\nIn a head race of about twenty<br />\nminutes, the Hopkins crews were<br />\nimpressive.<br />\nAt the Arid l Regatta,<br />\nBaltimore's races for crews from<br />\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, and<br />\nD.C., the Hopkins Varsity blew<br />\nthe competition out of the water.<br />\nThe Men's Varsity Lightweight<br />\nFour took first place, while the<br />\nHopkins JV took third. The<br />\nMen's Heavyweight Four took<br />\nthird place of five in their race.<br />\nTwo Men's Novice Eights from<br />\nHopkins placed third and fourth<br />\nin another race. The Women's<br />\nVarsity Eight, consisting largely<br />\nof last year's Novice Eight, who<br />\nplaced poorly at the '87 Arid, left<br />\nthe competition in the distant mist<br />\nthis year and sailed across the<br />\nfinish of their first-ever first place<br />\nvictory. The Women's Novice<br /><br />\nEight, powerful in strength and<br />\nwill, placed second in their race.<br />\nAt the internationally known<br />\nHead of the Charles Regatta in<br />\nBoston on October 23, the Men's<br />\nLightweight Four clashed oars<br />\nwith Dartmouth's shell while trying to overtake another boat. This<br />\nbit of whitewater and drama cost<br />\nHopkins about thirty seconds and<br />\nprobably five places in the race.<br />\nThey ended up 16th in a race of<br />\nmany more.<br />\nIn Virginia, the Head of the<br />\nOccoquien Regatta saw high<br />\nwinds, thunder, lightning, rain,<br />\nhail, and eventually a rainbow<br />\nspanning the river, the symbolism<br />\nof which seemed too obvious to<br />\nignore. Aside from the more<br />\nhackneyed poetic considerations,<br />\nthe precipitation had left the<br />\ncrews shivering and with the<br />\noverpowering desire for the finish<br />\nline and warm clothing. The<br />\nMen's Lightweight Four finished<br />\n28 seconds behind the first place<br />\nNew York maritime crew, with<br />\na place of third, while the<br />\nHeavyweight Four finished fourth,<br />\nwith a time of 20:50, 24 seconds<br />\nthe Lightweights in the race.<br />\nMen's Novice Eights from<br />\nHopkins took sixth and ninth in<br />\na field of thirteen. The Women's<br />\nVarsity Eight beat three boats,<br />\nwhich in the past have beaten<br />\nHopkins to place fourth after<br />\nthree boats from University of<br />\nVirginia and George Mason.<br />\nUVA's A boat won with a time<br />\nof 19:25 while the Hopkins<br />\nwomen rowed the three and onehalf miles in 20:16. The<br />\nWomen's Novice Eight was<br />\neleventh of fifteen.<br />\nThe successes of the fall give<br />\nthe Hopkins crew hope for the<br />\nupcoming Frostbite Regatta to be<br />\nheld in Philadelphia on Saturday,<br />\nNovember 19th. The regatta is a<br />\nchampionship of smaller schools<br />\nand the crews entering are excellent. Hopkins, though, is confident. In a head race, where<br />\ncrews are started one after<br />\nanother, with intervals or time<br />\nallowing each crew several<br />\nboatlengths to advance, crews<br />\nstarted behind others can pull<br />\nahead and surpass the crews<br />\nahead. This fall, Hopkins crew<br />\nhas been gaining on the competition and the spring looks<br />\npromising.<br /><br />\nHockey blanked by Hoyas<br />\nby Phillip Kouyoumdjian<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Blue Jays<br />\nIce Hockey Team hopes more<br />\nice-time is the answer to their<br />\nlackluster offensive performance<br />\nin their 4-0 loss against<br />\nGeorgetown last Thursday on<br />\nNovember 10.<br />\n\"These guys(Georgetown) have<br />\nalready played four games,\" said<br />\nnewly-appointed Hopkins coach<br />\nSteve Worth. \"We've only had<br />\nfour practices. If we keep working as hard as we have been in<br />\npractice, things will start coming<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nGeorgetown was, in fact, in<br />\nbetter shape than the Jays as they<br />\nalways seemed a step quicker to<br />\nthe puck. The greater amount of<br />\nice-time was demonstrated by<br />\nhasty break-outs from their own<br />\nend, crisp passing, and intelligent<br />\nset plays inside the Jays' blue<br />\nline. Georgetown's superior<br /><br />\nplaymaking really showed as they<br />\ntallied two of their four goals on<br />\npower-play opportunities.<br />\nHopkins's defense, on the other<br />\nhand, proved to be quite sound.<br />\nSophomore goaltender Ross Henshaw played extremely well, saving twenty-six out of thirty shots.<br />\nThe main factor in the Blue<br />\nJays' loss, however, was the<br />\nemotional let-down after<br />\nGeorgetown scored its third goal<br />\nearly in the second period.<br />\n\"After that third goal, we just<br />\ngave up,\" explained Worth.\"We<br />\ncan't do that.
