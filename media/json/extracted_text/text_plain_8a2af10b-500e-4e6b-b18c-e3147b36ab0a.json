A reception will follow immediately after the wedding ceremony at the city home of the bride's<br />\nparents in Williamsport.<br />\nHopkins football players, in particular, and all Hopkins students,<br />\nin general, are interested in this<br />\nwedding, because of Mr. Lynn's<br />\nconnection with Hopkins during<br />\nthe last two years in the. capacity<br />\nof coach of the football team. Coach<br />\nLynn was chosen by the Athletic<br />\nBoard in the spring of 1910 to succeed Mr. Gill as head coach of the<br />\nfootball team. He was ,highly<br />\nrecommended to the University by<br />\nWalter Camp, the dean of American football, and Ted Coy, the captain of teh Yale championship team<br />\nof 1909.<br />\nCoach Lynn was a member of the<br />\nYale 'Varsity squad for three years,<br />\nand was considered one of the most<br />\nreliable and one of the headiest of<br />\nthe Yale players. The Yale coaches<br />\nhad unbounded confidence in him.<br />\nWhen he assumed the direction of<br />\nthe Hopkins team last fall, prospects were not over bright, but<br />\nwith the assistance of Dr. Paul<br />\nSieber, he succeeded in turning out<br />\nthe best eleven that ever represented<br />\nthe Black and Blue on the gridiron.<br />\nAlthough many of last year's men<br />\nWill not play this season, Coach<br />\nLynn is hard at work, and before<br />\nthe home games come round, he<br />\ncan be depended upon to have a<br />\nteam on the field which will be able<br />\n1. to uphold the reputations made by<br />\nthe .teams of the last two seasons.<br />\nMiss McCormick is a \"darling,<br />\nand just the sweetest thing that<br />\never lived,\" according to stray remarks dropped by Coach Lynn from<br />\ntime to time. He even goes to the<br />\nextent of praising her in foreign<br />\nlanguages and was heard once to<br />\nexclaim: \"Ciel est toi,\" as he licked<br />\na postage stamp on the envelope<br />\nof a letter to his future better half.<br />\nMiss 1\\ICormick is a graduate of<br />\nthe Ogontz School, of Philadelphia,<br />\nPa. Her -family is well known in<br />\nNorthern Pennsylvania, and her<br />\nfather is one of the leading lawyers<br />\nof the State.<br />\n<br />\nWith the exception of one or two<br />\nattempts to make the underclassmen sing and practice yells, the<br />\nsophomores have so far kept in the<br />\nbackground, and there has been<br />\nlittle real hazing. On Wednesday,<br />\na brief concert, which was interrupted by the appearance of the<br />\npolice, was given on Howard street<br />\nand on Thursday, rumor had it, that<br />\nseveral freshies were taken to a<br />\nback yard in the vicinity of the University and turned into scrubwomen.<br />\nBoth were very harmless forms of<br />\ndiscipline.<br />\nBut meanwhile, contrary to all<br />\nHopkins traditions, the freshmen<br />\nwear their hats in McCoy Hall,<br />\nride in the elevator and swagger<br />\naround with senior-like assurance.<br />\nThere has not even been a classrush to dampen their boyish affrontery.<br />\nThe musical program which was<br />\ngiven on Wednesday at noon, was.<br />\nbrief but excellent. Six of the biggist freshmen in the class were<br />\ntaken to the curbstone in front of<br />\nthe buildings of the Geological<br />\nSurvey, on'<br />\nHoward street, divested<br />\nof their coats and hats, given song<br />\nbooks and told to warble. They<br />\nwarbled obediently and soon a large<br />\ncrowd gathered. Two policemen,<br />\nwho were at the corner of Franklin<br />\nand Howard streets, saw the commotion and heard the noise. They<br />\nstarted for the scene, but when they<br />\narrived, the prisoners had been hurried around on Monument street,<br />\nwhere a further program was rendered. This, according to some accounts, was unsatisfactory, and as<br />\na consequence, the offending freshmen were ducked in the fountain.<br />\nThe, scrubbing stunt took place<br />\non Thursday. The three freshmen<br />\n'who were captured, were made to<br />\ndon aprons and scrub. When they<br />\nhad concluded their tasks, the sophomores formed themselves into<br />\na mock faculty and awarded degrees, implying proficiency in the<br />\nart of removing dust and ashes and<br />\npolishing floors.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS WINS CLOSE GAME<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nThe line-up and summary:<br />\n<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nSteven<br />\nBishop, Paulus,<br />\nGillet<br />\nL E.

At any rate,<br />\nwhen the Hopkins management is<br />\nmaking up its schedule, it would<br />\ndo no. harm, and a great deal of<br />\ngood, to talk with representatives<br />\nof the Hillmen, and if the game<br />\nwere tried this year as an experiment, with the understanding that<br />\n'if ill-feeling developed, there would<br />\nnever be another contest, the students and club-men would be on<br />\ntheir guard against any hostile<br />\ndemonstrations on the field.<br />\nWe invite expressions of opinion<br />\non the subject.<br />\nHave the Class-Rush at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\n- Up until last year, one of the exciting features of the first few days<br />\nat Hopkins was the annual classrush between the freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, which was held in the<br />\nUniversity cage, under the direction<br />\nof a committee of seniors. The<br />\ntime for the fracas was announced,<br />\nand freshmen and sophomores,large<br />\nand small, were herded in the cage,<br />\nand given time to don suitable<br />\nclothes. Then each class was lined<br />\n<br />\nup on opposite ends of the track,<br />\nand at the given signal, there was<br />\nthe rush, the ensuing rough-house<br />\nand 'the flush of victory for one<br />\nclass.<br />\nSometimes the ground was covered with. tan-bark; Sometimes<br />\nnot, and then there was more fun.<br />\nThe faculty and non-interested students used to stand in the gallery<br />\nto see the fray, and class-spirit had<br />\nan opportunity to show itself in<br />\na mild and good-natured fashion.<br />\nThat the rush must be held during<br />\nthe first week, was one of Hopkins'<br />\ntraditions.<br />\nLast year, however, the University authorities, with a certain amount<br />\nof justification, decided that the<br />\ncage was too small and the risk<br />\nof injury too great. Accordingly,<br />\nHomewood was decided upon, and<br />\nthe two classes clashed between the<br />\nhalves of a football game.<br />\nThe same thing should be done<br />\nthis year. Saturday, October 21, the<br />\ndate for the game with the Maryland Agricultural College, is a good<br />\ntime, and it should be arranged for<br />\nthe rush to take place then. It<br />\nwould be an excellent feature to<br />\ndraw a crowd to see the game, and<br />\nwould be following the precedent<br />\nset last year.<br />\nTHF: NMS-LETTER suggests that<br />\nthe football management and the<br />\nclass presidents get together and<br />\nsee if whether this plan is not feasible.<br />\n<br />\nFALL CLOTHES!<br />\nWhy not a LEMMERT SUIT this time?<br />\nMade to measure from $18 up to $25, and hundreds<br />\nfrom which to choose.

A reception will follow immediately after the wedding ceremony at the city home of the bride's<br />\nparents in Williamsport.<br />\nHopkins football players, in particular, and all Hopkins students,<br />\nin general, are interested in this<br />\nwedding, because of Mr. Lynn's<br />\nconnection with Hopkins during<br />\nthe last two years in the. capacity<br />\nof coach of the football team. Coach<br />\nLynn was chosen by the Athletic<br />\nBoard in the spring of 1910 to succeed Mr. Gill as head coach of the<br />\nfootball team. He was ,highly<br />\nrecommended to the University by<br />\nWalter Camp, the dean of American football, and Ted Coy, the captain of teh Yale championship team<br />\nof 1909.<br />\nCoach Lynn was a member of the<br />\nYale 'Varsity squad for three years,<br />\nand was considered one of the most<br />\nreliable and one of the headiest of<br />\nthe Yale players. The Yale coaches<br />\nhad unbounded confidence in him.<br />\nWhen he assumed the direction of<br />\nthe Hopkins team last fall, prospects were not over bright, but<br />\nwith the assistance of Dr. Paul<br />\nSieber, he succeeded in turning out<br />\nthe best eleven that ever represented<br />\nthe Black and Blue on the gridiron.<br />\nAlthough many of last year's men<br />\nWill not play this season, Coach<br />\nLynn is hard at work, and before<br />\nthe home games come round, he<br />\ncan be depended upon to have a<br />\nteam on the field which will be able<br />\n1. to uphold the reputations made by<br />\nthe .teams of the last two seasons.<br />\nMiss McCormick is a \"darling,<br />\nand just the sweetest thing that<br />\never lived,\" according to stray remarks dropped by Coach Lynn from<br />\ntime to time. He even goes to the<br />\nextent of praising her in foreign<br />\nlanguages and was heard once to<br />\nexclaim: \"Ciel est toi,\" as he licked<br />\na postage stamp on the envelope<br />\nof a letter to his future better half.<br />\nMiss 1\\ICormick is a graduate of<br />\nthe Ogontz School, of Philadelphia,<br />\nPa. Her -family is well known in<br />\nNorthern Pennsylvania, and her<br />\nfather is one of the leading lawyers<br />\nof the State.<br /><br />\nWith the exception of one or two<br />\nattempts to make the underclassmen sing and practice yells, the<br />\nsophomores have so far kept in the<br />\nbackground, and there has been<br />\nlittle real hazing. On Wednesday,<br />\na brief concert, which was interrupted by the appearance of the<br />\npolice, was given on Howard street<br />\nand on Thursday, rumor had it, that<br />\nseveral freshies were taken to a<br />\nback yard in the vicinity of the University and turned into scrubwomen.<br />\nBoth were very harmless forms of<br />\ndiscipline.<br />\nBut meanwhile, contrary to all<br />\nHopkins traditions, the freshmen<br />\nwear their hats in McCoy Hall,<br />\nride in the elevator and swagger<br />\naround with senior-like assurance.<br />\nThere has not even been a classrush to dampen their boyish affrontery.<br />\nThe musical program which was<br />\ngiven on Wednesday at noon, was.<br />\nbrief but excellent. Six of the biggist freshmen in the class were<br />\ntaken to the curbstone in front of<br />\nthe buildings of the Geological<br />\nSurvey, on'<br />\nHoward street, divested<br />\nof their coats and hats, given song<br />\nbooks and told to warble. They<br />\nwarbled obediently and soon a large<br />\ncrowd gathered. Two policemen,<br />\nwho were at the corner of Franklin<br />\nand Howard streets, saw the commotion and heard the noise. They<br />\nstarted for the scene, but when they<br />\narrived, the prisoners had been hurried around on Monument street,<br />\nwhere a further program was rendered. This, according to some accounts, was unsatisfactory, and as<br />\na consequence, the offending freshmen were ducked in the fountain.<br />\nThe, scrubbing stunt took place<br />\non Thursday. The three freshmen<br />\n'who were captured, were made to<br />\ndon aprons and scrub. When they<br />\nhad concluded their tasks, the sophomores formed themselves into<br />\na mock faculty and awarded degrees, implying proficiency in the<br />\nart of removing dust and ashes and<br />\npolishing floors.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 2.)<br /><br />\nHOPKINS WINS CLOSE GAME<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nThe line-up and summary:<br /><br />\nHopkins.<br />\nSteven<br />\nBishop, Paulus,<br />\nGillet<br />\nL E.

At any rate,<br />\nwhen the Hopkins management is<br />\nmaking up its schedule, it would<br />\ndo no. harm, and a great deal of<br />\ngood, to talk with representatives<br />\nof the Hillmen, and if the game<br />\nwere tried this year as an experiment, with the understanding that<br />\n'if ill-feeling developed, there would<br />\nnever be another contest, the students and club-men would be on<br />\ntheir guard against any hostile<br />\ndemonstrations on the field.<br />\nWe invite expressions of opinion<br />\non the subject.<br />\nHave the Class-Rush at Homewood.<br /><br />\n- Up until last year, one of the exciting features of the first few days<br />\nat Hopkins was the annual classrush between the freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, which was held in the<br />\nUniversity cage, under the direction<br />\nof a committee of seniors. The<br />\ntime for the fracas was announced,<br />\nand freshmen and sophomores,large<br />\nand small, were herded in the cage,<br />\nand given time to don suitable<br />\nclothes. Then each class was lined<br /><br />\nup on opposite ends of the track,<br />\nand at the given signal, there was<br />\nthe rush, the ensuing rough-house<br />\nand 'the flush of victory for one<br />\nclass.<br />\nSometimes the ground was covered with. tan-bark; Sometimes<br />\nnot, and then there was more fun.<br />\nThe faculty and non-interested students used to stand in the gallery<br />\nto see the fray, and class-spirit had<br />\nan opportunity to show itself in<br />\na mild and good-natured fashion.<br />\nThat the rush must be held during<br />\nthe first week, was one of Hopkins'<br />\ntraditions.<br />\nLast year, however, the University authorities, with a certain amount<br />\nof justification, decided that the<br />\ncage was too small and the risk<br />\nof injury too great. Accordingly,<br />\nHomewood was decided upon, and<br />\nthe two classes clashed between the<br />\nhalves of a football game.<br />\nThe same thing should be done<br />\nthis year. Saturday, October 21, the<br />\ndate for the game with the Maryland Agricultural College, is a good<br />\ntime, and it should be arranged for<br />\nthe rush to take place then. It<br />\nwould be an excellent feature to<br />\ndraw a crowd to see the game, and<br />\nwould be following the precedent<br />\nset last year.<br />\nTHF: NMS-LETTER suggests that<br />\nthe football management and the<br />\nclass presidents get together and<br />\nsee if whether this plan is not feasible.<br /><br />\nFALL CLOTHES!<br />\nWhy not a LEMMERT SUIT this time?<br />\nMade to measure from $18 up to $25, and hundreds<br />\nfrom which to choose.
