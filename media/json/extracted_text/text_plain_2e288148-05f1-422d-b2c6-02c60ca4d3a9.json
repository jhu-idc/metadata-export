There<br />\nhas to be some sort of<br />\ncontinuity. The course will be a<br />\nbus ride through western<br />\nliterature with me as the<br />\nmoderator,\" said Macksey.<br />\nMacksey maintains that he is<br />\ngetting advice on how to plan the<br />\ncourse from all corners, and he<br />\ncalls that a good sign for the<br />\nfuture of the program. He<br />\npointed out that he will use some<br />\nfilms for parts of the course,<br />\nusing Fellini Satyicon when the<br />\nstudents are reading Petronius'<br />\n<br />\nwork,for example.<br />\n\"We will keep it to a lower<br />\nlevel course to invite people from<br />\nareas other than literature to<br />\nbecome involved,\" said Macksey.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Richard Macksey<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letter/may 5, 1972<br />\n<br />\nHopkins yearbook arrives early<br />\nReturns to traditional style<br />\nFor the first time in several<br />\nyears, Hopkins' yearbook has<br />\narrived before the seniors'<br />\ndeparture.<br />\nFive hundred and fifty copies'<br />\nof the Hullaballoo were delivered<br />\non Monday.

In fact, it seems really absurd that in a<br />\nyear which saw the appointment of a new president<br />\nand a generally more student-oriented administration,<br />\nplans for a student union, the BRP, the First<br />\nResponse, the Second Response and a Comparative<br />\nLiterature department, that the only issue with the<br />\npower to stir the phlegmatic spirit of the collective<br />\nstudent body was termpapers. Termpapers?<br />\nConsidering the endrmous variety of really<br />\nimportant issues to choose from, issues which have a<br />\nmore profound effect on the lives of undergraduates, it<br />\nseems almost sinful that students should be bitching<br />\nabout people buying grades when they don't even have<br />\na governance system. Believe it or not, a decent<br />\ngovernance system would help to solve far more<br />\nundergraduate problems that a thousand names on a<br />\ntermpaper petition<br />\n<br />\ntitles, and the Blue Ribbon Panel, that impressive<br />\nmisnomer, don't mean anything to undergraduates.<br />\nThese classy committees have come up with some<br />\npretty high-minded ideas. An independent study<br />\ncontract program. Interdepartmental majors. Teacher<br />\nevaluation. Whew! We're impressed. But we're having<br />\nsome trouble finding courses for next semester.<br />\nWe were particularly impressed when Steven Muller,<br />\nour own version of Kingman Brewster, stood on a milk<br />\ncrate in front of Homewood House to condemn the<br />\nwar while a crowd of, maybe 100 students sat on the<br />\ngrass soaking up the spring rays. And for<br />\nentertainment after the show there was the fair.<br />\nMeanwhile, Nixon's bombing the hell out of Vietnam,<br />\nbut promises not to use anything really deadly like<br />\natomic weapons. It's a damn good thing that we<br />\nweren't raised to be concerned about these kinds of<br />\nthings. After all, we're students, and exams are<br />\nbreathing down our necks.<br />\nBut, as years go, this one has been better than most.<br />\nNixon will hopefully lose the election. We'll hopefully<br />\nget some academic reform, and possibly even some<br />\nbetter housing. The women will get a gynecologist and<br />\neverybody may get some better food.<br />\nThe only definite thing about next year is that you<br />\nwon't see any termpaper ads in the News-Letter. The<br />\nMaryland Legislature has outlawed them, but, more<br />\nimportantly, we took a stand on that issue long ago.<br />\nTermpapers? Sure.<br />\n<br />\nBut it's not only the students' fault. Agreed that the<br />\nadministration has made some fine proposals that<br />\nwould up-grade the position of the undergraduate, but<br />\nthese changes remain to be seen. We would like to<br />\nbelieve the administration when they say that they're<br />\ngoing to improve student housing. It's about time that<br />\nthey made student housing livable. But, still there will<br />\nbe women living in the dorms next year because the<br />\nUniversity won't be able to fulfill its obligations. And<br />\nmen will receive no housing privileges whatsoever.<br />\n<br />\nAfrican interests<br />\nI was not aware of, nor was I contacted<br />\nby, the group of black Hopkins<br />\nadministrators, faculty, students and<br />\nalumni. Hence, since the paucity of<br />\nblacks in any of the segments of which<br />\nthe group is composed implies their<br />\nconcurrence with the statement issued by<br />\nthe group, I am registering a strong<br />\ndissent; for I am sick to death of groups<br />\nlike this purporting to speak for me.<br />\nAs a scientist and a pragmatist (but not<br />\na moralist!), I have to be opposed to any<br />\nUnilateral action by Hopkins in divesting<br />\nitself of any financial involvement in<br />\nSouth Africa. The failures of economic<br />\nmoves such as the group supports in<br />\nachieving any goals already fill the history<br />\nbooks. Moreover, the brutal fact is that<br />\nthe only salvation for the blacks in South<br />\nAfrica (as it was here in 1861) lies in a<br />\nmilitary conflict; for the white mystique<br />\nis such that, where race is an issue, even<br />\nthe dollar is not sancrosanct \u2014just witness<br />\nthe proliferation of private schools since<br />\nthe 1954 Supreme Court decision. Why<br />\nblacks won't acknowledge that fact<br />\ncontinues to mystify me.<br />\nSo,<br />\nto that %soup that purports to<br />\n_<br />\nc<br />\nsa-c,c\u2022<br />\n<br />\nblacks as volunteers to help invade South<br />\nAfrica? Like me, it seems. you backed<br />\naway; but unlike you, I didn't retreat to<br />\nthe sidelines and then start yelling for<br />\nHopkins to do something I was afraid to<br />\ndo. I consider it reprehensible that you<br />\nfind it convenient and popular (and safe!)<br />\nto make demands when the consequences<br />\nof those demands involve no sacrifice on<br />\nyour part. You know, if we blacks were<br />\nJews, we'd be contributing neither cent<br />\nnor soul to thwart the threat of the arab<br />\ncountries.<br />\n<br />\nAnd don't hand me that crap about it's<br />\njust plain ole morality of the<br />\nsituation\u2014that ole morality in this<br />\ncountry is dead, and we blacks did our<br />\nshare in destroying it. Even in times of<br />\nthe new morality wherein anything goes<br />\nso long as it doesn't hurt the other guy, I<br />\nfind your position untenable. Who will<br />\nsuffer most if the economy of South<br />\nAfrica collapses? Is it o.k. to sacrifice a<br />\nwhole generation to even more misery<br />\nand poverty, the effects of which will<br />\npersist for generations?If you're going to<br />\ndo anything, at least a military solution<br />\nwon't have such a long term debilitating<br />\nconsequences for so many people.<br />\nFor still another reason your rhetoric<br />\nhas me confused indeed, you speak with<br />\nforked tongues. On the one hand you're<br />\nyelling\u2014again from the sidelines\u2014for us<br />\nto get out of Vietnam. In no way, you<br />\nsay, should we interfere with the'<br />\ngovernment process of that country. If<br />\nthe Communists overrun it and subject<br />\nthe non-communists to a hell similar to<br />\nthat of the blacks in South Africa, your<br />\nnon-humanitarian response is that it's<br />\n<br />\nThe decoration of bark cloth: Fijian Masi<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nGale Troxler has done more things<br />\nthan many people here at Hopkins.

Known in other parts of the Pacific<br />\nas Tapa Cloth, masi comes from the<br />\nsmooth inner bark of the paper mulberry<br />\ntree. The intricate design motifs which<br />\ncharacterize Fijian masi have deep<br />\ncultural significance for the islanders.<br />\nGale's own collection of masi is on<br />\ndisplay in the lobby of the Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary until May 14.<br />\n<br />\nThe paper mulberry tree (Broussonetia<br />\nPapyrifera) is cultivated by Fijian men in<br />\nsmall plantations, and cut down when it<br />\nreaches maturity, at which point it is<br />\ntwelve feet high, with a trunk only several<br />\ninches in circumference. The bark is<br />\nseparated from the tree by soaking, and<br />\nthen beaten flat on a log. A strip of bark<br />\nonly two inches wide can be beaten out<br />\nto a width of two feet. Finished pieces<br />\nare united to form great sheets of bark<br />\ncloth many yards in length and width.<br />\nAfter masi is dried in the sun, it can be<br />\nmarked, stencilled, stained or painted<br />\nusing dyes from other Fijian trees.<br />\nOriginally used as clothing, masi came<br />\nto be a sacred part of Fijian community<br />\nlife. It had the distinction of being the<br />\nclothing of the gods as well, and thus<br />\nreceived the highest place of honor in the<br />\nceremonies of birth, puberty, marriage,<br />\ndeath, and most important, the<br />\ninstallation of a chief. Masi was also used<br />\nin Fijian houses to provide partitions for<br />\nprivacy, and as an article of formal barter<br />\nor exchange.<br />\nToday, about eighty percent of the<br />\nvvlians 1ve m villages where they preserve<br />\nz-wcf<br />\n<br />\nly-<br />\n<br />\nii1iitci<br />\n<br />\namt.,till Is<br />\n<br />\nc.,t<br />\n<br />\nbark cloth were to be found on Fiji,<br />\n<br />\nmostly for ceremonial use, the last few<br />\nyears have seen a revival in the<br />\nproduction of masi.

She taught<br />\nEnglish and History at the Williams high<br />\nschool in Lautoka, and spent much of her<br />\nspare time researching the centuries-old<br />\nart of masi. Gale visited many of the<br />\nislands in the Fiji chain, and traveled to<br />\nthe remote Lau group of islands, where<br />\nsome of the finest masi is made.<br />\nPeople on the islands were of help to<br />\nGale in her research. One woman in<br />\nparticular, Adi Laisa Ganilau, made<br />\nefforts to have the tradition of masi<br />\nrevived and recognized, and Gale's book is<br />\ndedicated to her.

What is<br />\nwritten here is a chronicle of the<br />\nuniqueness ofour class, those elements of<br />\nthe group that have been here, left their<br />\nmark, and will never be here again.<br />\nIt had been a long time since we stood<br />\nin the rain and watched the Blue Jays<br />\nplay Army in lacrosse. We were high<br />\nschool seniors then, visiting the school<br />\nthat had accepted us, perhaps feeling<br />\nconspicuous in our coats and ties. At half<br />\ntime of that game, someone rolled out a<br />\nsign across the end of the field that read<br />\nBEAT ARMY\u2014RESIST THE DRAFT. It<br />\nall seemed somewhat foreign. Joe Cowan<br />\nand Downey McCarty led the Jays to a<br />\n15-8 victory.<br />\nIn the fall we came back, sitting in our<br />\ncinder-block cubicle, fearful of our<br />\nunknown roommate. We found<br />\nsomething to link us together, whether it<br />\nwas our Ivy League rejections, our<br />\nsimilarly processed intellects , or our<br />\ncollective fear of the unknown that<br />\nawaited us. Clams renutcl interesting<br />\n<br />\nthen, and we strolled jauntily across the<br />\ngrassy plains, rejoicing that college was<br />\nnow a reality. Above all, we felt free, but<br />\nslowly the realization that there was<br />\nnothing to do with our freedom crept<br />\nupon us. The cinder block became<br />\ndepressing, oppressing, and we turned to<br />\nthe escape that proliferated in our<br />\nmidst\u2014drugs. For some it was the first<br />\ntime, others had experimented before.<br />\nBut none of us had ever lived in an<br />\nenvironment where mind-expanding<br />\nsubstances were so plentiful. Times were<br />\nsomewhat different then, and we<br />\napproached each other suspiciously,<br />\nlearning happily of the large numbers of<br />\npartakers. Remember, we were the last<br />\nclass to come to college with out hair<br />\nshort and rebelliously let it grow during<br />\nour stay away from home. It was in that<br />\nsame spirit of rebellion that we let the<br />\nmixed aromas of marijuana and incense<br />\ndominate the dorms. Psychedelics were<br />\nfor the adventuresome (\"But what about<br />\nmy chromosomes?\"), but their use begar<br />\nto spread. And then, someone awoke us<br />\nfrom our stupor and told us of our exams<br />\narid papers and we discovered that our<br />\ndealer had a cure for even<br />\nthat\u2014amphetamines. Zooming through a<br />\npaper and crashing over sickly fried eggs<br />\nat breakfast\u2014do you remember, do-wah?<br />\nSecond semester began, fraternities, we<br />\njoined them or not, it didn't seem to<br />\nmatter. Any non-addictive drug was<br />\navailable in any quantity at nearly a<br />\nmoment's notice, the glares of the<br />\nColonel being of no avail. Our first<br />\nenthusiasm at collegiate academics had<br />\noh-so-quickly become a cynical appraisal<br />\nof whether classes were worth attending.<br />\nThrough our misty, bloodshot eyes, we<br />\ngazed with apathy through the rain-filled<br />\nspring upon the political scene, standing,<br />\nfor the most part, with Lincoln Gordon<br />\nwhen he faced down the radicals outside<br />\nof Homewood House. It was against our<br />\nrebelliousness, but those guys were just so<br />\n<br />\nto continue, and it worked for a while.<br />\nfull of shit. Only one thing could raise us<br />\nBut somehow, the dope wasn't the same<br />\nto the heights of confrontation<br />\nwhen we were surrounded by cheap<br />\npolitics\u2014The Bust. The memory of that<br />\npaneling and strangers. And for almost all<br />\nawesome event will leave the campus with<br />\nof us, it happened sometime that year.<br />\nus, and it is a shame, for it is well worth<br />\nMaybe it was the cockroaches, or the<br />\nremembering. Totally spontaneous, the<br />\nfilth, or the constant diet of B&M subs,<br />\nword spreading like wildfire through the<br />\ndorms, we were all mad but what to do? or that ever-present paneling. Or maybe it<br />\nSuddenly we were out in the street, was that last trip (early sunshine claimed<br />\nblocking the police cars, chanting \"We all<br />\na lot of victims) or coming out of that<br />\n<br />\nsmoke dope.\" flashing lights everywhere,<br />\nthen the mace and the gas. and we were<br />\nover at Gordon's and he was there in his<br />\nbathrobe (but still with his pipe), and<br />\nsomehow we were together. The<br />\nexcitement remained for a few days, a<br />\nfull-page ad in the Sun, but then it was<br />\ntime for exams, and we got out the speed,<br />\nor what was left of it after the pros got<br />\nthrough, and then we went home.<br />\nWe came back to the ghetto and tried<br />\n<br />\nmonth-long stone. Or maybe it was a<br />\nblack-beauty crash (though of course we<br />\ndidn't give up speed, for it was part of<br />\nacademia), or the realization that we were<br />\nliving with people we didn't really know<br />\nor like, and that we didn't really have any<br />\nfriends. But, at some time that year, it<br />\nhappened, and we quit. or we found<br />\nsomething to do. A woman (or women),<br />\nan activity, academics, parties, groups,<br />\nsomehow placing order on the chaos. It<br />\n<br />\nwas still strange, the artificiality of our<br />\nactions was too clear, but their necessity<br />\nwas pressing. Politics were more liberal<br />\nand thus palatable. We trekked to<br />\ndowntown Baltimore and then to<br />\nWashington before our winter<br />\nhibernation. The alienation was no longer<br />\nabstract, it was real, and it scared us.<br />\nPerhaps it was fighting that feeling that<br />\nmade us drift to the front of Homewood<br />\nHouse one Friday afternoon in the spring.<br />\nWe left a few hours later with an<br />\ninjunction against us. Some camped for<br />\nthe weekend (the tents), our cultural<br />\nrevolution contingent). Others planned in<br />\nthe endless meetings that filled Levering's<br />\nGreat Hall. Monday, the showdown came,<br />\nand we got the injunction lifted. Tuesday<br />\nwe were there again, resolutions and<br />\ndemands littering our wake, and we<br />\nwatched in amazement as Gordon left for<br />\nWashington and handed his prepared<br />\nstatement to George Benton, then a<br />\nstranger. So the Strike was Wednesday<br />\nand Thursday, picket lines and redfists,<br />\nand TV cameras and class attendance<br />\ndown, and more meetings. A settlement,<br />\nthe referendum and WE WON, we stood<br />\nup to the military and said Fuck You!<br />\nAnd then 1_ ambodia and Kent and<br />\nJackson States and back to Washington<br />\nand classes called for a day, and into<br />\ndowntown Baltimore. We were all there<br />\ntogether. And we were really never to see<br />\neach other again. Back in the fall, the<br />\nmeetings were disjointed, military<br />\nrecruiting quietly came back, the war<br />\nwent on. We smoked a little dope, and<br />\nreturned to our separate patterns. It was,<br />\nafter all, time to study if we were going<br />\nto get into grad school. Or time to do<br />\nsomething if we were going to maintain<br />\nour sanity. So we did something and<br />\nceased to demand the apocalypse, and let<br />\nthe last two years slip by, quickly in a<br />\nway, much to our relieved horror. We<br />\nlived different places and found old or<br />\nnew friends and tried to keep ourselves<br />\n<br />\namused.

Instead of<br />\nbeing so far away, these two<br />\nmajor leaguers were at close<br />\nrange, where I could verify that<br />\nthey looked just like anyone else.<br />\nMore importantly, it was obvious<br />\nthat these guys were human,<br />\npersonable fellows, and a joy to<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nchat with.<br />\nThe press conference centered<br />\naround the ballplayers' personal<br />\nlives, and the joys and problems<br />\nof playing baseball for a living.<br />\nOne special problem inherent<br />\nin a ballplayer's profession is the<br />\nstrain on his family life from<br />\nbeing away from home so often.<br />\nIn Merv's words, \"I spend more<br />\ntime away from home than I do<br />\nat home. For a number of<br />\nreasons I played winter ball, and<br />\nnow I have a lot of speaking<br />\nengagements for the club.

As<br />\nfor the most exciting place to<br />\nvisit, New York was rated at the<br />\ntop, as well as Oakland and Los<br />\nAngeles.<br />\nOne writer in the crowd asked<br />\nif there was any truth to Jim<br />\nBouton's claims of players using<br />\ndrugs. Rettenmund didn't deny<br />\nit. \"Bouton, in his book, named<br />\nDetroit and Baltimore as the<br />\nteams that used the most drugs.<br />\n<br />\nThere's some truth to it, because<br />\nthat year (1970) the Tigers and<br />\nthe Orioles were the main<br />\ncontenders.\"<br />\nWhen asked about his visit to<br />\nVietnam to entertain the troops,<br />\nRet tenmun d was surprisingly<br />\ncandid on a subject he could have<br />\nhedged on.<br />\n<br />\nAitcm<br />\nb\u2018<br />\nTR..11.4!<br />\n<br />\ndescribes the Maryland midfield<br />\nunits as the best Hopkins has<br />\nseen all year.

Thearle<br />\nplayed for Farmingdale<br />\nCommunity College last year and<br />\nhas been an all-league player<br />\nsince his freshman year in high<br />\nschool.<br />\nBest Goalie<br />\nAbly manning the goal for<br />\nMaryland is Bill Beilly, an<br />\nAll-American honorable mention<br />\nlast year. He has been performing<br />\nwell all season for the Terps, as<br />\nindicated by his showing against<br />\nArmy, and Coach Scott says he is<br />\nthe best goalie Hopkins will face<br />\nthis year.<br />\nThe Terrapins will certainly be<br />\nready for the Hopkins game as<br />\nKaestner hopes to make good on<br />\nhis promist to score four goals on<br />\nthe Blue Jays. However, Scott's<br />\nsquad is just as intense in their<br />\ndesire to finish the regular season<br />\nwith an unblemished record.<br />\nWhatever the result of the May<br />\n13 encounter, though, Hopkins is<br />\nvirtually assured of an invitation<br />\nto the 1972 NCAA playoffs<br />\nwhich begin May 20. Eight teams<br />\nwill be selected within the next<br />\nten days and the champion will<br />\nbe crowned following a single<br />\n<br />\nelimination tournament.<br />\nContrary to current rumor, no<br />\nteam qualifies automatically.<br />\nInstead, two teams are picked<br />\nfrom NCAA Districts I and II,<br />\ntwo are picked from Districts III<br />\nthrough VIII, with four chosen at<br />\nlarge from any district. Hopkins<br />\nwill most likely be one of the<br />\nteams selected to represent<br />\nDistricts III-VIII, and, as such,<br />\nwill probably host their first<br />\nround contest.<br />\nThe semi-final round will be<br />\nplayed on May 27 with the sites<br />\nto be determined later, with the<br />\nfinals to be played June 3 at<br />\nByrd.<br />\nSpeculation suggests that<br />\nArmy, Cortland State, Hopkins,<br />\nMaryland, Navy, and Virginia<br />\nmay be invited with Brown,<br />\nCornell, Hobart, Towson State,<br />\nand Washington & Lee among<br />\n<br />\n'Faceoffgoes to Hopkins<br />\nthose under consideration for the<br />\nremaining two at large slections.<br />\nBefore anyone crowns<br />\nHopkins champions, however,<br />\nthe team must earn the trophy.<br />\nLast year several regular season<br />\nresults were reversed in the<br />\ntournament, and Virginia,<br />\nundefeated in collegiate play at<br />\nthe time and favored to win it all,<br />\nlost to Navy in the first round.<br />\nSo, while the Blue Jays have an<br />\nexcellent shot at the title, any<br />\nclaims to it must wait until the<br />\ntournament is completed.<br />\n<br />\n.\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nNCAA<br />\nLACROSSE TOURNAMENT PAIRINGS<br />\nCapitals denote home team<br />\nAt College Park<br />\nSat.

The proposals stem<br />\nfrom the AC's First Response<br />\nWhich called for a reorganization<br />\nof undergraduate education.<br />\nThe Second Response suggests<br />\na series of interdepartmental<br />\nPrograms which will replace the<br />\narea major at Hopkins. The AC<br />\nplan points out that the freedom<br />\nof choice in curriculum and<br />\nabsence of specific requirements<br />\nfor the area major make it an<br />\nattractive program but the lack<br />\nof faculty contact and faculty<br />\nresponsibility for area majors<br />\nPresents a drawback to the<br />\nProgram.<br />\nUnder the Council's proposal<br />\nacademic \"groups\" will be<br />\nestablished composed of the<br />\nfaculty from two or more related<br />\ndepartments.

According to Gary<br />\nSoulsman, one of the class<br />\nmembers, \"The thing was that<br />\nTheatre Hopkins, which is not a'<br />\nUniversity group, was taking time<br />\naway from a class in a University<br />\nfacility.\"<br />\nPD members further<br />\nmaintained that Theatre Hopkins<br />\ncontained no Hopkins people in<br />\nits castings, and that.

He<br />\npointed out that he will use some<br />\nfilms for parts of the course,<br />\nusing Fellini Satyicon when the<br />\nstudents are reading Petronius'<br /><br />\nwork,for example.<br />\n\"We will keep it to a lower<br />\nlevel course to invite people from<br />\nareas other than literature to<br />\nbecome involved,\" said Macksey.<br /><br />\nDr. Richard Macksey<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/may 5, 1972<br /><br />\nHopkins yearbook arrives early<br />\nReturns to traditional style<br />\nFor the first time in several<br />\nyears, Hopkins' yearbook has<br />\narrived before the seniors'<br />\ndeparture.<br />\nFive hundred and fifty copies'<br />\nof the Hullaballoo were delivered<br />\non Monday.

In fact, it seems really absurd that in a<br />\nyear which saw the appointment of a new president<br />\nand a generally more student-oriented administration,<br />\nplans for a student union, the BRP, the First<br />\nResponse, the Second Response and a Comparative<br />\nLiterature department, that the only issue with the<br />\npower to stir the phlegmatic spirit of the collective<br />\nstudent body was termpapers. Termpapers?<br />\nConsidering the endrmous variety of really<br />\nimportant issues to choose from, issues which have a<br />\nmore profound effect on the lives of undergraduates, it<br />\nseems almost sinful that students should be bitching<br />\nabout people buying grades when they don't even have<br />\na governance system. Believe it or not, a decent<br />\ngovernance system would help to solve far more<br />\nundergraduate problems that a thousand names on a<br />\ntermpaper petition<br /><br />\ntitles, and the Blue Ribbon Panel, that impressive<br />\nmisnomer, don't mean anything to undergraduates.<br />\nThese classy committees have come up with some<br />\npretty high-minded ideas. An independent study<br />\ncontract program. Interdepartmental majors. Teacher<br />\nevaluation. Whew! We're impressed. But we're having<br />\nsome trouble finding courses for next semester.<br />\nWe were particularly impressed when Steven Muller,<br />\nour own version of Kingman Brewster, stood on a milk<br />\ncrate in front of Homewood House to condemn the<br />\nwar while a crowd of, maybe 100 students sat on the<br />\ngrass soaking up the spring rays. And for<br />\nentertainment after the show there was the fair.<br />\nMeanwhile, Nixon's bombing the hell out of Vietnam,<br />\nbut promises not to use anything really deadly like<br />\natomic weapons. It's a damn good thing that we<br />\nweren't raised to be concerned about these kinds of<br />\nthings. After all, we're students, and exams are<br />\nbreathing down our necks.<br />\nBut, as years go, this one has been better than most.<br />\nNixon will hopefully lose the election. We'll hopefully<br />\nget some academic reform, and possibly even some<br />\nbetter housing. The women will get a gynecologist and<br />\neverybody may get some better food.<br />\nThe only definite thing about next year is that you<br />\nwon't see any termpaper ads in the News-Letter. The<br />\nMaryland Legislature has outlawed them, but, more<br />\nimportantly, we took a stand on that issue long ago.<br />\nTermpapers? Sure.<br /><br />\nBut it's not only the students' fault. Agreed that the<br />\nadministration has made some fine proposals that<br />\nwould up-grade the position of the undergraduate, but<br />\nthese changes remain to be seen. We would like to<br />\nbelieve the administration when they say that they're<br />\ngoing to improve student housing. It's about time that<br />\nthey made student housing livable. But, still there will<br />\nbe women living in the dorms next year because the<br />\nUniversity won't be able to fulfill its obligations. And<br />\nmen will receive no housing privileges whatsoever.<br /><br />\nAfrican interests<br />\nI was not aware of, nor was I contacted<br />\nby, the group of black Hopkins<br />\nadministrators, faculty, students and<br />\nalumni. Hence, since the paucity of<br />\nblacks in any of the segments of which<br />\nthe group is composed implies their<br />\nconcurrence with the statement issued by<br />\nthe group, I am registering a strong<br />\ndissent; for I am sick to death of groups<br />\nlike this purporting to speak for me.<br />\nAs a scientist and a pragmatist (but not<br />\na moralist!), I have to be opposed to any<br />\nUnilateral action by Hopkins in divesting<br />\nitself of any financial involvement in<br />\nSouth Africa. The failures of economic<br />\nmoves such as the group supports in<br />\nachieving any goals already fill the history<br />\nbooks. Moreover, the brutal fact is that<br />\nthe only salvation for the blacks in South<br />\nAfrica (as it was here in 1861) lies in a<br />\nmilitary conflict; for the white mystique<br />\nis such that, where race is an issue, even<br />\nthe dollar is not sancrosanct \u2014just witness<br />\nthe proliferation of private schools since<br />\nthe 1954 Supreme Court decision. Why<br />\nblacks won't acknowledge that fact<br />\ncontinues to mystify me.<br />\nSo,<br />\nto that %soup that purports to<br />\n_<br />\nc<br />\nsa-c,c\u2022<br /><br />\nblacks as volunteers to help invade South<br />\nAfrica? Like me, it seems. you backed<br />\naway; but unlike you, I didn't retreat to<br />\nthe sidelines and then start yelling for<br />\nHopkins to do something I was afraid to<br />\ndo. I consider it reprehensible that you<br />\nfind it convenient and popular (and safe!)<br />\nto make demands when the consequences<br />\nof those demands involve no sacrifice on<br />\nyour part. You know, if we blacks were<br />\nJews, we'd be contributing neither cent<br />\nnor soul to thwart the threat of the arab<br />\ncountries.<br /><br />\nAnd don't hand me that crap about it's<br />\njust plain ole morality of the<br />\nsituation\u2014that ole morality in this<br />\ncountry is dead, and we blacks did our<br />\nshare in destroying it. Even in times of<br />\nthe new morality wherein anything goes<br />\nso long as it doesn't hurt the other guy, I<br />\nfind your position untenable. Who will<br />\nsuffer most if the economy of South<br />\nAfrica collapses? Is it o.k. to sacrifice a<br />\nwhole generation to even more misery<br />\nand poverty, the effects of which will<br />\npersist for generations?If you're going to<br />\ndo anything, at least a military solution<br />\nwon't have such a long term debilitating<br />\nconsequences for so many people.<br />\nFor still another reason your rhetoric<br />\nhas me confused indeed, you speak with<br />\nforked tongues.

Known in other parts of the Pacific<br />\nas Tapa Cloth, masi comes from the<br />\nsmooth inner bark of the paper mulberry<br />\ntree. The intricate design motifs which<br />\ncharacterize Fijian masi have deep<br />\ncultural significance for the islanders.<br />\nGale's own collection of masi is on<br />\ndisplay in the lobby of the Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary until May 14.<br /><br />\nThe paper mulberry tree (Broussonetia<br />\nPapyrifera) is cultivated by Fijian men in<br />\nsmall plantations, and cut down when it<br />\nreaches maturity, at which point it is<br />\ntwelve feet high, with a trunk only several<br />\ninches in circumference. The bark is<br />\nseparated from the tree by soaking, and<br />\nthen beaten flat on a log. A strip of bark<br />\nonly two inches wide can be beaten out<br />\nto a width of two feet. Finished pieces<br />\nare united to form great sheets of bark<br />\ncloth many yards in length and width.<br />\nAfter masi is dried in the sun, it can be<br />\nmarked, stencilled, stained or painted<br />\nusing dyes from other Fijian trees.<br />\nOriginally used as clothing, masi came<br />\nto be a sacred part of Fijian community<br />\nlife. It had the distinction of being the<br />\nclothing of the gods as well, and thus<br />\nreceived the highest place of honor in the<br />\nceremonies of birth, puberty, marriage,<br />\ndeath, and most important, the<br />\ninstallation of a chief. Masi was also used<br />\nin Fijian houses to provide partitions for<br />\nprivacy, and as an article of formal barter<br />\nor exchange.<br />\nToday, about eighty percent of the<br />\nvvlians 1ve m villages where they preserve<br />\nz-wcf<br /><br />\nly-<br /><br />\nii1iitci<br /><br />\namt.,till Is<br /><br />\nc.,t<br /><br />\nbark cloth were to be found on Fiji,<br /><br />\nmostly for ceremonial use, the last few<br />\nyears have seen a revival in the<br />\nproduction of masi. Co-operatives on the<br />\nvarious islands are now selling bark cloth<br />\nto local merchants as the tourist trade<br />\ngrows, and Handicrafts of Fiji<br />\nCooperative, Ltd. showed sales of<br />\nS30,000 in its first year.<br />\nTradition Intact<br />\nDespite the commercialization of masi,<br />\nefforts are being made to keep the<br />\ntraditional motifs intact. Most of the masi<br />\nsold to tourists comes from the island of<br /><br />\nVatulele. where the women are<br />\nindustrious and relatively well-organized.<br />\nIts low prices also make it attractive to<br />\npeople who are concerned with<br />\nmementos.<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n}.1 10.4,;<br /><br />\nzsic,rly zirsc..1 tilt tc-r-<br /><br />\nbark<br /><br />\ncloth.

She happened upon Fiji on<br /><br />\nthe way to Australia, after having worked<br />\nas a technical writer for several<br />\ncompanies. She was the associate<br />\nengineering writer for Westinghouse<br />\nUnderseas in Annapolis Sealab In project,<br />\nan experiment in underwater living.<br />\nPreviously, she taught computer<br />\nprogramming (1108) for Univac, and<br />\nworked as a freelance technical writer.<br />\nTeacher<br />\nIn Fiji, she was known as Gale Scott<br />\n(her middle name), because Troxler was<br />\ntoo hard to pronounce. She taught<br />\nEnglish and History at the Williams high<br />\nschool in Lautoka, and spent much of her<br />\nspare time researching the centuries-old<br />\nart of masi. Gale visited many of the<br />\nislands in the Fiji chain, and traveled to<br />\nthe remote Lau group of islands, where<br />\nsome of the finest masi is made.<br />\nPeople on the islands were of help to<br />\nGale in her research. One woman in<br />\nparticular, Adi Laisa Ganilau, made<br />\nefforts to have the tradition of masi<br />\nrevived and recognized, and Gale's book is<br />\ndedicated to her. Unfortunately, she died<br />\nbefore it was published.<br />\nShe sent some back to Fiji, for the<br />\nwmtriaaw\u2014w-uhimiA;t1 \u2022a'<br />\nMasi is the title of Gale's book<br />\nand it represents a great deal of her time.<br /><br />\nApart from the two years she spent in<br />\nFiji, Gale wrote, edited, laid out and<br />\npublished the book herself at a cost to<br />\nher of $7.50 per book. It would be a<br />\ngood book for a scholarly publisher to<br />\nput out, because it is original, thorough,<br />\ninteresting, and well-written. Gale<br />\npublished a limited edition of 500 copies.<br />\nAnyone interested in obtaining a copy<br />\nof Fijian Masi or information on bark<br />\ncloth should write to Gale (Fijian Masi,<br />\n2405 Madison Ave., Greensboro, N.C.,<br />\n27403).<br /><br />\nThis is not really the history of the class of'72 in your yearbook<br />\nWhat is written here is not really the<br />\nhistory of the class of '72 as you ?night<br />\nhave read it in your yearbook.

What is<br />\nwritten here is a chronicle of the<br />\nuniqueness ofour class, those elements of<br />\nthe group that have been here, left their<br />\nmark, and will never be here again.<br />\nIt had been a long time since we stood<br />\nin the rain and watched the Blue Jays<br />\nplay Army in lacrosse. We were high<br />\nschool seniors then, visiting the school<br />\nthat had accepted us, perhaps feeling<br />\nconspicuous in our coats and ties. At half<br />\ntime of that game, someone rolled out a<br />\nsign across the end of the field that read<br />\nBEAT ARMY\u2014RESIST THE DRAFT. It<br />\nall seemed somewhat foreign. Joe Cowan<br />\nand Downey McCarty led the Jays to a<br />\n15-8 victory.<br />\nIn the fall we came back, sitting in our<br />\ncinder-block cubicle, fearful of our<br />\nunknown roommate. We found<br />\nsomething to link us together, whether it<br />\nwas our Ivy League rejections, our<br />\nsimilarly processed intellects , or our<br />\ncollective fear of the unknown that<br />\nawaited us. Clams renutcl interesting<br /><br />\nthen, and we strolled jauntily across the<br />\ngrassy plains, rejoicing that college was<br />\nnow a reality. Above all, we felt free, but<br />\nslowly the realization that there was<br />\nnothing to do with our freedom crept<br />\nupon us. The cinder block became<br />\ndepressing, oppressing, and we turned to<br />\nthe escape that proliferated in our<br />\nmidst\u2014drugs. For some it was the first<br />\ntime, others had experimented before.<br />\nBut none of us had ever lived in an<br />\nenvironment where mind-expanding<br />\nsubstances were so plentiful. Times were<br />\nsomewhat different then, and we<br />\napproached each other suspiciously,<br />\nlearning happily of the large numbers of<br />\npartakers. Remember, we were the last<br />\nclass to come to college with out hair<br />\nshort and rebelliously let it grow during<br />\nour stay away from home. It was in that<br />\nsame spirit of rebellion that we let the<br />\nmixed aromas of marijuana and incense<br />\ndominate the dorms. Psychedelics were<br />\nfor the adventuresome (\"But what about<br />\nmy chromosomes?\"), but their use begar<br />\nto spread. And then, someone awoke us<br />\nfrom our stupor and told us of our exams<br />\narid papers and we discovered that our<br />\ndealer had a cure for even<br />\nthat\u2014amphetamines. Zooming through a<br />\npaper and crashing over sickly fried eggs<br />\nat breakfast\u2014do you remember, do-wah?<br />\nSecond semester began, fraternities, we<br />\njoined them or not, it didn't seem to<br />\nmatter. Any non-addictive drug was<br />\navailable in any quantity at nearly a<br />\nmoment's notice, the glares of the<br />\nColonel being of no avail. Our first<br />\nenthusiasm at collegiate academics had<br />\noh-so-quickly become a cynical appraisal<br />\nof whether classes were worth attending.<br />\nThrough our misty, bloodshot eyes, we<br />\ngazed with apathy through the rain-filled<br />\nspring upon the political scene, standing,<br />\nfor the most part, with Lincoln Gordon<br />\nwhen he faced down the radicals outside<br />\nof Homewood House. It was against our<br />\nrebelliousness, but those guys were just so<br /><br />\nto continue, and it worked for a while.<br />\nfull of shit. Only one thing could raise us<br />\nBut somehow, the dope wasn't the same<br />\nto the heights of confrontation<br />\nwhen we were surrounded by cheap<br />\npolitics\u2014The Bust. The memory of that<br />\npaneling and strangers. And for almost all<br />\nawesome event will leave the campus with<br />\nof us, it happened sometime that year.<br />\nus, and it is a shame, for it is well worth<br />\nMaybe it was the cockroaches, or the<br />\nremembering. Totally spontaneous, the<br />\nfilth, or the constant diet of B&amp;M subs,<br />\nword spreading like wildfire through the<br />\ndorms, we were all mad but what to do? or that ever-present paneling. Or maybe it<br />\nSuddenly we were out in the street, was that last trip (early sunshine claimed<br />\nblocking the police cars, chanting \"We all<br />\na lot of victims) or coming out of that<br /><br />\nsmoke dope.\" flashing lights everywhere,<br />\nthen the mace and the gas. and we were<br />\nover at Gordon's and he was there in his<br />\nbathrobe (but still with his pipe), and<br />\nsomehow we were together. The<br />\nexcitement remained for a few days, a<br />\nfull-page ad in the Sun, but then it was<br />\ntime for exams, and we got out the speed,<br />\nor what was left of it after the pros got<br />\nthrough, and then we went home.<br />\nWe came back to the ghetto and tried<br /><br />\nmonth-long stone. Or maybe it was a<br />\nblack-beauty crash (though of course we<br />\ndidn't give up speed, for it was part of<br />\nacademia), or the realization that we were<br />\nliving with people we didn't really know<br />\nor like, and that we didn't really have any<br />\nfriends. But, at some time that year, it<br />\nhappened, and we quit. or we found<br />\nsomething to do. A woman (or women),<br />\nan activity, academics, parties, groups,<br />\nsomehow placing order on the chaos. It<br /><br />\nwas still strange, the artificiality of our<br />\nactions was too clear, but their necessity<br />\nwas pressing. Politics were more liberal<br />\nand thus palatable. We trekked to<br />\ndowntown Baltimore and then to<br />\nWashington before our winter<br />\nhibernation. The alienation was no longer<br />\nabstract, it was real, and it scared us.<br />\nPerhaps it was fighting that feeling that<br />\nmade us drift to the front of Homewood<br />\nHouse one Friday afternoon in the spring.<br />\nWe left a few hours later with an<br />\ninjunction against us. Some camped for<br />\nthe weekend (the tents), our cultural<br />\nrevolution contingent). Others planned in<br />\nthe endless meetings that filled Levering's<br />\nGreat Hall. Monday, the showdown came,<br />\nand we got the injunction lifted. Tuesday<br />\nwe were there again, resolutions and<br />\ndemands littering our wake, and we<br />\nwatched in amazement as Gordon left for<br />\nWashington and handed his prepared<br />\nstatement to George Benton, then a<br />\nstranger. So the Strike was Wednesday<br />\nand Thursday, picket lines and redfists,<br />\nand TV cameras and class attendance<br />\ndown, and more meetings. A settlement,<br />\nthe referendum and WE WON, we stood<br />\nup to the military and said Fuck You!<br />\nAnd then 1_ ambodia and Kent and<br />\nJackson States and back to Washington<br />\nand classes called for a day, and into<br />\ndowntown Baltimore. We were all there<br />\ntogether. And we were really never to see<br />\neach other again. Back in the fall, the<br />\nmeetings were disjointed, military<br />\nrecruiting quietly came back, the war<br />\nwent on. We smoked a little dope, and<br />\nreturned to our separate patterns. It was,<br />\nafter all, time to study if we were going<br />\nto get into grad school. Or time to do<br />\nsomething if we were going to maintain<br />\nour sanity. So we did something and<br />\nceased to demand the apocalypse, and let<br />\nthe last two years slip by, quickly in a<br />\nway, much to our relieved horror. We<br />\nlived different places and found old or<br />\nnew friends and tried to keep ourselves<br /><br />\namused. And after four years, we are<br />\nready to leave, stamped with the seal of<br />\napproval, and maybe we can't remember<br />\nwhether you push or pull on the doors to<br />\nthe library to get them open, but<br />\nsomehow we managed to get out.<br /><br />\n\u2022 --page .10/i1e4vs-1etterYiriay\"5;. 1:972<br /><br />\nShirley:'on Chisholm trail'<br />\nBy WARREN GULIN<br />\nThe \"tractable American<br />\nelectorate\" and corrupt<br />\npoliticians with vested interests<br />\nwere attacked by Shirley<br />\nChisholm is a speech delivered at<br />\nTowson State College Tuesday<br />\nnight.<br />\nCongresswoman Chisholm also<br />\ntold the several hundred people<br />\npresent that her defeat in the<br />\nupcoming Presidential election<br />\nwculd not be a true defeat.<br />\n\"Whether I lose or win is of no<br />\nconsequence.

Instead of<br />\nbeing so far away, these two<br />\nmajor leaguers were at close<br />\nrange, where I could verify that<br />\nthey looked just like anyone else.<br />\nMore importantly, it was obvious<br />\nthat these guys were human,<br />\npersonable fellows, and a joy to<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nchat with.<br />\nThe press conference centered<br />\naround the ballplayers' personal<br />\nlives, and the joys and problems<br />\nof playing baseball for a living.<br />\nOne special problem inherent<br />\nin a ballplayer's profession is the<br />\nstrain on his family life from<br />\nbeing away from home so often.<br />\nIn Merv's words, \"I spend more<br />\ntime away from home than I do<br />\nat home. For a number of<br />\nreasons I played winter ball, and<br />\nnow I have a lot of speaking<br />\nengagements for the club. It's a<br />\nstrain on family life year round.\"<br />\nPeculiar Schedule<br />\nWhile on the road, the players<br />\nadapt to the peculiar schedule<br />\nimposed on them by night games.<br />\nAfter a game, the guys go back to<br />\nthe room to watch TV until it<br />\ngoes off the air, around four.<br />\nThey sleep till one, eat a light<br />\nlunch, and then catch a movie<br />\nbefore going to the park.<br />\nOf the other eleven American<br />\nLeague cities, both Rettenmund<br />\nand Buford laughed out<br />\n\"Cleveland!\" in unison when<br />\nasked which was the dullest. As<br />\nfor the most exciting place to<br />\nvisit, New York was rated at the<br />\ntop, as well as Oakland and Los<br />\nAngeles.<br />\nOne writer in the crowd asked<br />\nif there was any truth to Jim<br />\nBouton's claims of players using<br />\ndrugs. Rettenmund didn't deny<br />\nit. \"Bouton, in his book, named<br />\nDetroit and Baltimore as the<br />\nteams that used the most drugs.<br /><br />\nThere's some truth to it, because<br />\nthat year (1970) the Tigers and<br />\nthe Orioles were the main<br />\ncontenders.\"<br />\nWhen asked about his visit to<br />\nVietnam to entertain the troops,<br />\nRet tenmun d was surprisingly<br />\ncandid on a subject he could have<br />\nhedged on.<br /><br />\nAitcm<br />\nb\u2018<br />\nTR..11.4!<br /><br />\ndescribes the Maryland midfield<br />\nunits as the best Hopkins has<br />\nseen all year. Starring for the<br />\nTerps are junior Doug Schreiber,<br />\nan all-junior college transfer from<br />\nNassau County, and captain Gary<br />\nBesosa, another fine faceoff man.<br />\nLast year, Besosa earned the<br />\nteam \"Ground Ball Hawk\" title,<br />\nand he will challenge the Hopkins<br />\nground ball dominance.<br />\nDefensively, Maryland has a<br />\nsolid unit that is keystoned by<br />\njunior John Thearle. Thearle<br />\nplayed for Farmingdale<br />\nCommunity College last year and<br />\nhas been an all-league player<br />\nsince his freshman year in high<br />\nschool.<br />\nBest Goalie<br />\nAbly manning the goal for<br />\nMaryland is Bill Beilly, an<br />\nAll-American honorable mention<br />\nlast year. He has been performing<br />\nwell all season for the Terps, as<br />\nindicated by his showing against<br />\nArmy, and Coach Scott says he is<br />\nthe best goalie Hopkins will face<br />\nthis year.<br />\nThe Terrapins will certainly be<br />\nready for the Hopkins game as<br />\nKaestner hopes to make good on<br />\nhis promist to score four goals on<br />\nthe Blue Jays. However, Scott's<br />\nsquad is just as intense in their<br />\ndesire to finish the regular season<br />\nwith an unblemished record.<br />\nWhatever the result of the May<br />\n13 encounter, though, Hopkins is<br />\nvirtually assured of an invitation<br />\nto the 1972 NCAA playoffs<br />\nwhich begin May 20. Eight teams<br />\nwill be selected within the next<br />\nten days and the champion will<br />\nbe crowned following a single<br /><br />\nelimination tournament.<br />\nContrary to current rumor, no<br />\nteam qualifies automatically.<br />\nInstead, two teams are picked<br />\nfrom NCAA Districts I and II,<br />\ntwo are picked from Districts III<br />\nthrough VIII, with four chosen at<br />\nlarge from any district. Hopkins<br />\nwill most likely be one of the<br />\nteams selected to represent<br />\nDistricts III-VIII, and, as such,<br />\nwill probably host their first<br />\nround contest.<br />\nThe semi-final round will be<br />\nplayed on May 27 with the sites<br />\nto be determined later, with the<br />\nfinals to be played June 3 at<br />\nByrd.<br />\nSpeculation suggests that<br />\nArmy, Cortland State, Hopkins,<br />\nMaryland, Navy, and Virginia<br />\nmay be invited with Brown,<br />\nCornell, Hobart, Towson State,<br />\nand Washington &amp; Lee among<br /><br />\n'Faceoffgoes to Hopkins<br />\nthose under consideration for the<br />\nremaining two at large slections.<br />\nBefore anyone crowns<br />\nHopkins champions, however,<br />\nthe team must earn the trophy.<br />\nLast year several regular season<br />\nresults were reversed in the<br />\ntournament, and Virginia,<br />\nundefeated in collegiate play at<br />\nthe time and favored to win it all,<br />\nlost to Navy in the first round.<br />\nSo, while the Blue Jays have an<br />\nexcellent shot at the title, any<br />\nclaims to it must wait until the<br />\ntournament is completed.<br /><br />\n.\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nNCAA<br />\nLACROSSE TOURNAMENT PAIRINGS<br />\nCapitals denote home team<br />\nAt College Park<br />\nSat.

Similarly, Airport<br />\nAuthority officials have blamed<br />\nthe commercial airlines of<br />\npurposfully delaying<br />\nmodernization plans until the<br />\nairport sale, in hopes of avoiding<br />\nrenovation costs.<br />\nRobert L. Scott, Eastern<br />\nAirlines official and chairman of<br /><br />\nthe negotiating committee for all<br />\ncommercial airlines involved,<br />\nrecently attacked the present<br />\nrental payments.\"We do not owe<br />\nthem $56 million,\" he said,<br />\n\"That $1.4 million should have<br />\nbeen plowed right back into the<br />\nairport.\"<br />\nDragging Feet<br />\nRepresenting the airport,<br />\nWilliam Adelson, chairman of the<br />\nFriendship International Airport<br />\nAuthority accused the<br />\ncommercial airlines of \"dragging<br />\ntheir feet\" in negotiations over<br />\nfinancing Friendship's<br />\nmodernization because of the<br />\npossibility of a state takeover of<br />\nthe airport.<br />\nIf the state does buy the<br />\nairport from Baltimore City for<br />\nan agreed price of $26 million in<br />\nbonds and an estimated $14.6<br />\nmillion in interest payments, the<br />\ncommercial airlines will win their<br />\ntwo year battle to stop<br />\nunderwriting Friendship's $1.4<br />\nmillion-a-year rental costs and<br />\nmay avoid paying for airport<br />\nrenovations by refusing to pay<br />\nincreased airport fees.<br />\nIf the sale does take place, and<br />\nthe airlines decide not to<br />\ncooperate on modernization<br />\nfinancing, the State of Maryland<br />\nwill have to pay for airport<br />\nimprovements with money<br />\nobtained from the state gasoline<br />\ntax which makes up the bulk of<br />\nMaryland's Consolidated<br />\nTransportation Fund.<br />\nLose Money<br />\nEven if the airlines agree to<br />\nhelp fund the needed airport<br />\nimprovements, the sale of the<br />\ncity-owned airport to the state<br />\nwill cost the Maryland public $50<br />\nmillion in property taxes.<br />\nBaltimore City Mayor Donald<br />\nSchaefer, a converted supporter<br />\nof the proposed airport sale,<br />\nadmitted that the Maryland<br />\npublic would lose money. \"It<br />\nwould be a burden on the<br />\ntaxpayer-no question about it,\"<br />\nsaid the Mayor.
