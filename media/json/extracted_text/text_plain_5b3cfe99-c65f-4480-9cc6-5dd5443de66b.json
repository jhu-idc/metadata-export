The ratio is similar to the<br />\nnational ratio of foreign versus<br />\nAmerican graudate students.<br />\n<br />\n\"This is a serious problem for the<br />\nU.S.,\" said Meyer. \"Fewer<br />\nAmerican students are entering<br />\nthe major. At the same time,<br />\nneeds for mathematically-trained<br />\npeople are increasing, especially<br />\nin the industrial sector.\"<br />\nOn a more local scale, the<br />\ndepartment has made efforts at<br />\nlessening the problems created by<br />\nforeign students not proficient in<br />\nEnglish, the bulk of whom are<br />\nOriental.<br />\nOne measure is the offering of<br />\neconomic incentives and special<br />\nfellowships offered to American<br />\nGraduate students. Other efforts<br />\ninclude an integration of<br />\nAmerican and foreign students in<br />\nthe shared offices. Although the<br />\nforeign students are not required<br />\nto take English courses, they are<br />\nstrongly encouraged to do so.<br />\nMeyer points out, however,<br />\nthat the problem lies in the<br />\nunavailability of conversational<br />\nEnglish courses.<br />\n\"They've learned grammar and<br />\ncan read [English],\" said Meyer,<br />\n\"but they can't speak it. The<br />\ncourses offered [to foreign<br />\nstudents] are deliberately slanted<br />\ntowards grammar.

Conversely,<br />\nmore foreign teaching assistants<br />\nare allotted to upper-level<br />\ncourses, such as Linear Algebra.<br />\n\"The philosophy is that the<br />\nyounger the students, the more<br />\nimportant it is for them to have<br />\n[instructors] who have a good<br />\nmastery of English,\" said<br />\nGoeoff.<br />\nUnfortunately, many freshmen,<br />\nsuch as Nancy Kang, begin with<br />\nCalculus II.<br />\n\"My TA doesn't speak English<br />\nwell,\" said Kang. \"We're not<br />\nlearning anything from him.

He attempted to establish that periods<br />\nof prolonged deficit actually<br />\nmake consumers feel wealthier,<br />\nand therefore encourage them to<br />\nspend more money.<br />\nEisner had charts which tied the<br />\nlevel of the deficit closely with<br />\nthe growth of real gross national<br />\nproduct, the level of employment,<br />\nand the value of the Dow Jones<br />\nIndustrial Average. In fact, he<br />\nsaid, \"those who blamed the<br />\nstock crash of 1987 on the budget<br />\ndeficit were dead wrong. There<br />\nwas a sharp decline in the deficit<br />\nright before the crash.\"<br />\nEisner was questioned as to<br />\nhow the government measures its<br />\nbudget deficit. He said, \"The<br />\nbudget deficit necessarily includes an inflation tax because the<br />\nreal value of the dollar also influences the real terms of the<br />\ndebt.\"<br />\nHe strongly challenged the<br />\nKeynesian model of economics,<br />\nwhich suggests that deficit spending necessarily ignores inflation.<br />\nHe argued, \"If you have a deficit<br />\nwhich increases at the rate of inflation annually, then no real debt<br />\nis accumulated.\" He noted that if<br />\nstate budget spending, net<br />\ngovernment investment, and the<br />\n\"inflation tax\" for fiscal 1988<br />\nwere considered, the government<br />\nwould actually have a surplus.<br />\nHe also argued the importance<br />\nof considering the federal debt in<br />\nterms of percentage of the GNP,<br />\nthat is, the net debt per capita. He<br />\nsaid, \"If you compare the net<br />\ndebt today, you'll find it's much<br />\nlower than at some other poit,ts<br />\n<br />\nsince 1945.\"\u201e<br />\nEisner also pointed out that<br />\nwhile the net worth of government may have dropped because<br />\nof the budget deficit, its relevant<br />\nworth has not. \"The relevant<br />\nworth shows what the government is actually acquiring through<br />\ntaxes and other sources rather<br />\nthan what it owns in terms of property,\" said Eisner.<br />\nHe also showed that the<br />\ngovernment measures its deficit<br />\nin terms of all investments at current expenditure, but to be consistent it should only include<br />\ndepreciation rather than capital<br />\nspending.<br />\nHe further argued, \"Those<br />\nwho say the budget deficit jeopardizes our children's future are ignoring the facts.\" He strongly<br />\nsuggested that capital was the<br />\nmain factor for guaranteeing the<br />\nfuture, and that capital is not<br />\nalways influenced by the deficit.<br />\n\"The problem is that most people seem to think capital is only<br />\nindustrial machinery,\" said<br />\nEisner. \"Capital is also roads,<br />\nbridges, dams, and other things.\"<br />\nCapital, he said, has been increasing strongly regardless of the<br />\ndeficit.<br />\nEisner also said those who<br />\nwere dedicated to slashing the<br />\nbudget deficit could create more<br />\nharm than good. He said, \"The<br />\neconomy needs stimulation based on two areas: maximum current production and maximal<br />\npotential output later.\"<br />\nHe said the deficit often provided that crucial level of stimulation. \"There are just no good<br />\n<br />\nJim Crawford<br />\n<br />\nEconomist Robert Eisner closed out the 1988 Milton S.

Earlier this year,<br />\nthe Union of Jewish Graduate<br />\nStudents requested $1200 from<br />\nthe GRO to hold a Talmudic<br />\nreading series. When the GRO inquired how much financial support the Chaplain was providing,<br />\nthey were told $100. Two weeks<br />\nago, on the other hand, I heard<br />\nfrom a member of the Graduates<br />\nfor Social Responsbility that they<br />\nwere promised $800 to invite Abby Hoffman to campus.<br />\nThe Chaplain's Sunday experience, in advertising \"The<br />\nCandidate\" distributed a reprint<br />\nof a Vanity Fair article that mocks<br />\nDan Quayle. While it is not my<br />\nintention to defend Quayle, I find<br />\nit disturbing to see the Chaplain's<br />\noffice effectively endorsing a candidate before the elections.<br />\nLast year, the College<br />\nRepublicans, among others, complained that the Chaplain is sponsoring a fast for the benefit of Oxfam, an ostensibly charitable<br />\norganizaiton that has been known<br />\nto have provided support to the<br />\nSandinistas and the Angolan<br />\ngovernment. Following the controversy, the Chaplain promised<br />\nto have a politically neutral charity represented during the<br />\nfundraising effort. Ignoring her<br />\nown promise, the Chaplain intends to sponsor the fast this year<br />\nwithout an alternate politically<br />\nneutral charity.<br />\nIt has become evident that<br />\nChaplain Van Utt is not adhering<br />\nto the mandate of her office, but<br />\nrather using her office to promote<br />\nher own leftist political agenda.<br />\nThe SAC and GRO always provide financial support to political<br />\nevents of all kinds. There is absolutely no excuse why the<br />\nChaplain should be spending her<br />\nbudget on political events while<br />\ndenying sufficient funds to<br />\nreligious groups which should be<br />\nher primary concern. I hope that<br />\nthe student body realizes the<br />\ngravity of the Chaplain's alarming tendency and will help put an<br />\nend to this abuse of university<br />\nfunds and office.<br />\n<br />\nSecond, Mr. Mordkoff is correct when he implies that our efforts to ameliorate the current<br />\nsituation in this area have been<br />\nperceived as promoting a heavily anti-foreign feeling on campus.<br />\nLet me assure everyone that it has<br />\nnot been, nor will it ever be, my<br />\nintention in this effort to alienate<br />\nthe members of the foreign<br />\ngraduate student community at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Rather, my hope<br />\nis to improve what appears to be<br />\na difficult status quo for foreign<br />\ngrad students, as well as<br />\nundergrads.<br />\nWhile Toby Mordkoff does<br />\nmake some valid points in his letter, he also makes points which<br />\nlack validity. First, it is absolutely<br />\ncriminal for him to suggest that<br />\nbecause Johns Hopkins is<br />\nprimarily a research institution,<br />\nthe undergraduates, who pay to<br />\nattend this university, should grin<br />\nand bear incomprehensible instructors for the sake of departmental research. Second, what is<br />\nat issue here is not the ability of<br />\nforeign graduate teaching<br />\nassistants to speak English \"as<br />\nwell as we [as Americans] would<br />\nlike, but instead their ability to<br />\nspeak English at all . Third, Mr.<br />\nMordkoff is again wrong when he<br />\nsuggests that my solution to this<br />\nproblem is a new rule. What we<br />\nare seeking to implement is a<br />\ncomprehensive policy which will<br />\naccomodate the needs of both<br />\nnew and continuing foreign<br />\ngraduate teaching assistants, as<br />\nwell as the undergraduates,<br />\ndepartments, and the administration.<br />\nYes, Mr. Mordkoff, we are<br />\ntalking about people, people who<br />\ncome from nations around the<br />\nglobe, who are completely unfamiliar with this nation, who are<br />\nexpected not only to master<br />\nchallenging academic work and<br />\nthe peculiarities of life in<br />\nAmerica, but also instruct<br />\nundergraduates, all without the<br />\nability to communicate in the<br />\nlanguage in which our lives, both<br />\npersonal and professional, are<br />\nconducted.<br />\nMr. Mordkoff calls me \"selfcentered\" and claims I \"ignore<br />\nreality. If serving my fellow<br />\nundergraduate portends my<br />\negotism and ignorance then I will<br />\neagerly continue to work for what<br />\nis right, while sacrificing universal admiration and omniscience.<br />\n<br />\nOussama Himani<br />\nJeff DeCagna<br />\n<br />\nTA's and English<br />\nPhi Psi complaint<br />\nTo the E-ditors:<br />\nI would like to respond to J.<br />\nToby Mordkoffs letter regarding<br />\nmy position on the issue of<br />\nlanguage proficiency among<br />\nforeign graduate students who act<br />\nas teaching assistants.<br />\nFirst, Mr. Mordkoff is quite<br />\ncorrect when he states that<br />\nAmerica benefits from the immigration of high-caliber<br />\ngraduate students from around the<br />\nworld to our country to study.<br />\nWhat he fails to recognize is that<br />\na foreign graduate teaching assistant of superior intellectual ability does not benefit an<br />\nundergraduate student if that<br />\nT.A. does not posses the<br />\nnecesssary tool to share his (or<br />\nher) knowledge, i.e., and ability<br />\nto communicate in English.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Saturday, October 29,<br />\n1988, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity<br />\nhosted its eighth annual Phi Psi<br />\n500 fundraiser on the Gilman<br />\nQuad. Aside from being a major<br />\nsocial event and parents weekend<br />\nattraction, this event was one of<br />\nthe biggest student-organized<br />\ncharity fundraisers ever at<br />\nHopkins. Phi Psi, Homewood<br />\nundergraduates, graduates, and<br />\nfaculty, as well as neighborhood<br />\nresidents, raised over $2000.00<br />\nfor Santa Claus Anonymous. This<br />\nyear's 500 was a shining example of how the Homewood community, with all its diversity,<br />\ncould work together towards a<br />\ncharitable goal.<br />\n<br />\nPreviously, it had been our<br />\nunderstanding that the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter, above all, functioned as an organ of communication<br />\nfor the Homewood campus. In<br />\nthis light it seems inconceivable<br />\nthat an event of such potential interest to the Hopkins Community could have been neglected by<br />\nthe News-Letter staff. This is<br />\nespecially disconcerting when<br />\none considers that the Gazette ,<br />\na tabloid which serves the entire<br />\nnetwork of Johns Hopkins institutions, gave the Phi Psi 500 front<br />\npage coverage.<br />\nThe decision on the part of the<br />\nNews-Letter staff to ignore this<br />\nyear's Phi Psi 500 was negligent.<br />\nWe sincerely hope this failing of<br />\nthe News-Letter in its primary<br />\nresponsibility to effectively report<br />\nnews at Homewood is not a<br />\nprecedent for the future.<br />\nMurat Akalin<br />\nAvram Frankel<br />\n<br />\nThe N-L's great!!<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI just wanted to tell you that the<br />\narticle Jon Stempel did for the<br />\nNovember 4 issue of the NewsLetter on student housing was excellent.

Apartments<br />\ncan isolate people; that is why I<br />\nbelieve it is difficult to maintain<br />\n<br />\na strong Wolman/McCoy community. As a Housemaster I am<br />\nrequired to have dorm programs<br />\nfor the freshmen at least three<br />\ntimes a month. The community<br />\nassistants have the same requirement; they probably even need to<br />\ndo more programs. I have suffered the frustration of brainbusting for a dorm program,<br />\nadvertising for it, and having very<br />\nfew people show up. And I live<br />\non campus with a bunch of eager,<br />\nenthusiastic freshmen in a dorm<br />\nsetting. If! can't get people who<br />\nwalk by my room regularly to<br />\nstop in for a program, I can imagine how hard it is to do a program for upperclassmen living in<br />\nan apartment setting.

To be honest,<br />\nI've never been a fervent U2 fan<br />\nand I've never seen them in concert. Boy and War are brilliant<br />\nalbums. I'll admit, but not quite<br />\n<br />\nmy speed, while the later LPs,<br />\nThe Unforgettable Fire and The<br />\nJoshua Tree, are truly admirable,<br />\nbut for me, only in a vague, saccharine sort of way. The U2<br />\npresented here, however, the one<br />\nstripped of media and studio<br />\nsheen and polish, is gritty, raw,<br />\ncharismatic, possessed, and<br />\nwholly sincere in its vision of<br />\nrock and roll. If bandmen Bono,<br />\nThe Edge, Larry Mullen, and<br />\nAdam Clayton, are at all likable<br />\n<br />\nin this film, it's purely because<br />\nthey're so unpredictably nononsense; nothing is glossed over.<br />\nA favored scene: Minutes before<br />\nthe \"Save the Yuppie Free Concert\" given in San Francisco last<br />\nfall. The band has decided to<br />\ncover Bob Dylan's \"All Along<br />\nthe Watchtower\" and the tenable<br />\nnervous energy as a) Bono tries<br />\nto simultaneously sing and learn<br />\nthe words (they're written on 3\"<br />\nX 5\" sheets of paper, which he<br />\n<br />\nshuffles continually) and b) The queer, dreamlike authority.

The children of<br />\nthese immigrants, however, show<br />\na decrease in the \"Japanese\"<br />\ncancers and an increase in the<br />\n\"U.S.\" cancers.

Avoidance consists<br />\nof \"protection and prevention.\"<br />\nPrevention involves reduction in<br />\ncigarette consumption and radiation in the environment. Protection involves the \"establishment<br />\nof a state of reduced susceptibility to carcinogens,\" according to<br />\nTalalay.<br />\nTalalay concluded by focusing<br />\non some methods used to<br />\ndecrease human susceptibility to<br />\ncancer-causing agents, describing<br />\nsome of the pioneering work done<br />\nin his laboratory.<br />\nThe first such analysis of carcinogenic substances was in the<br />\n1700's, when it was discovered<br />\nthat chimney sweeps had a high<br />\nincidence of cancer of the<br />\nscrotum. At that time it was suggested as a solution that the<br />\nscrotum simply be removed.<br />\nLater it was discovered that benzopyrene\u2014a hydrocarbon presently<br />\nfound in automobile exhaust<br />\nwith \"pleasant, but lethal<br />\nshapes\"--caused the cancer. It<br />\nwas subsequently found that other<br />\nchemicals could block the carcinogenicity of benzopyrene.<br />\nThe same was found true of azo<br />\ndye, called \"butter yellow,\"<br />\n<br />\nformerly used in the Orient to<br />\ncolor butter. Laboratory experiments showed that this dye<br />\ncaused a quick-spreading cancer<br />\nof the liver in 100 percent of the<br />\nrats studied. When treated with<br />\nan aromatic organic compound,<br />\nthis cancer rate decreases to 17<br />\npercent.<br />\nTalalay explains that the carcinogenicity is blocked by<br />\nstimulating enzymes in the liver<br />\nthat break down the dye and<br />\nrender it inactive and unable to<br />\ncause cancer. Examples of such<br />\nchemicals are BHA and BHT,<br />\ncalled phenolic antioxidants,<br />\nfound in many foods. Many other<br />\nblockers of chemical carcinogenesis<br />\nhave<br />\nbeen<br />\ndiscovered, all affecting the way<br />\nthe body processes the carcinogenic chemical.<br />\nUltimately, says Talalay, the<br />\ncontrol of carcinogenesis arises<br />\nfrom the balance of activating and<br />\ninactivating enzymes\u2014those enzymes that either aid or block the<br />\nprocessing of the chemical<br />\nthrough the body. Talalay has<br />\nfound that different vegetables,<br />\nsuch as broccoli, celery, and<br />\nginger, block certain carcinogenic<br />\nsubstances. He hopes to discover<br />\nhow such compounds block the<br />\ncarcinogens, and hopes to find<br />\nother substances that will provide<br />\na similar benefit in the fight<br />\nagainst cancer.<br />\n<br />\nfeolfwA<br />\nWatiliarval<br />\nTHANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE<br />\n1988 FAST FOR A WORLD HARVEST on<br />\nNovember 17, and for your contributions to<br />\nOxfam America and/or Manna House soup<br />\nkitchen of Baltimore City.<br />\n. . . gentle reminders. . .<br />\n1) Please leave your MEAL CARDS in the<br />\nTerrace Room after dinner on the evening<br />\nof November 16.

These initial attacks<br />\nare highly variable, affecting<br />\nsight, speech, movement, or intellectual functions. Problems like<br />\nblindness in one eye or numbness<br />\nfrom the waist down develop<br />\nquickly over two to three days,<br />\nlast a few months, and then<br />\ngradually disappear. Attacks<br />\nbecome more frequent over the<br />\nyears, and recovery becomes less<br />\nand less complete. The victim<br />\nbecomes increasingly handicapped. MS almost always ends in<br />\ndeath 30 to 35 years from<br />\ndiagnosis.<br />\nThis general pattern of MS<br />\nsometimes leads to psychological<br />\nproblems. While most of their<br />\npeers are looking ahead to bright<br />\nfutures, MS patients often worry<br />\nabout what new handicap the<br />\nfuture will bring. They can't plan<br />\na family or start a career when, in<br />\na few months, they may be partially blind; a few years later, unable to think.<br />\nApproximately one-fifth of MS<br />\npatients suffer acute and continuous impairment. A small frac-<br />\n<br />\ntion experience a few attacks during adolescence, and then go on<br />\nto lead normal lives. The extreme variability of MS makes<br />\nit a scientifically fascinating<br />\ndisease. Two scientists who study<br />\nMS and related disorders gave<br />\nlectures recently as part of the<br />\nStudents Against Multiple<br />\nseries,<br />\nlecture<br />\nSclerosis<br />\n\"Neurology, Research, and<br />\nMultiple Sclerosis.\"<br />\nDr. Kenneth Johnson gave the<br />\nfirst lecture on November 2. He<br />\nis the Chairman of the Department<br />\nof Neurology with a joint appointment in microbiology at the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland Medical<br />\nSchool. A nationally acknowledged expert in MS, he is the director of the Maryland Center for<br />\nMultiple Sclerosis.<br />\nDr. Richard Johnson lectured<br />\non November 7. The two are not<br />\nrelated, but Dr. K. Johnson<br />\nstudied under Dr. R. Johnson at<br />\nthe Case Western Reserve<br />\nUniversity. Dr. R. Johnson is<br />\nProfessor and Director of the<br />\nDepartment of Neurology and<br />\nNeurologist-in-Chief at Hopkins<br />\nHospital, as well as Professor of<br />\nMicrobiology and Neuroscience<br />\nat the Medical School with a joint<br />\nappointment at Public Health. He<br />\nspecializes in viral infections of<br />\nthe nervous system. He chairs the<br />\nMedical Advisory Board for the<br />\nMultiple Sclerosis Society.<br />\nMS is a demyelinating disease,<br />\nmeaning it attacks the protective<br />\nsheath of protein myelin from the<br />\nnerve fibers. Once this layer of<br />\ninsulation is gone, the messages<br />\nof sensory perception, muscular<br />\nmovement, and thought do not<br />\n<br />\nreach their destination as quickly<br />\nor as completely as they do over<br />\nnormal nerve fibers. Since the<br />\nmessages are slower and weaker,<br />\nthe functions they govern are impaired. To the victim, this means<br />\nparalysis, blindness, slowed<br />\nthought processes, and other handicaps. The initial demyelination<br />\nleads to excess fluid around the<br />\nnerve, which hampers transmission further. As this fluid is reabsorbed. much the same way that<br />\nthe swelling of a bruise recedes,<br />\nfunction gradually returns.<br />\nHowever, the myelin does not<br />\ngrow back, and the cumulative effects of neurological attacks eventually cripple the brain.<br />\nThe cause of MS is uncertain,<br />\nbut three contributing factors<br />\nhave been identified: genetics,<br />\nenvironment, and the actual agent<br />\nof demylination, the immune<br />\nsystem. MS is not directly inherited; rather, one inherits the<br />\ntendency to develop MS. MS<br />\nresearchers have concluded from<br />\nepidemiological studies that<br />\nthe genetic factor is a tendency<br />\nand not a certainty. For example, although identical twins<br />\nhave identical genes, it is common for one twin to have MS and<br />\nthe other to be unafflicted.

Epidemiological studies have<br />\ndemonstrated that MS is much<br />\nmore common in the temperate<br />\nzones, specifically the northern<br />\nUnited States and Northern<br />\nEurope. In the US. Northerners<br />\nare twice as likely to develop MS<br />\nas Southerners. Whatever this environmental influence is, it must<br />\nhappen around age thirteen. Intensive research has proven that<br />\nthose who are born in the MS<br />\nregions and later move to<br />\nSouthern latitudes, who move<br />\nbefore adolescence, have a<br />\nSoutherner's chance of developing MS, just as if they had been<br />\nborn in the lower latitudes. Those<br />\nwho moved after adolescence had<br />\nthe potefitial to develop MS as do<br />\nthose who stay in the North their<br />\nwhole lives. Dr. K. Johnson<br />\nsuspects a viral infection, particularly something akin to<br />\nmeasles, while Dr. R. Johnson<br />\nremains uncertain.<br />\nThe ultimate cause of MS is the<br />\nimmune system. MS is an autoimmune disease, a general<br />\ndescription for a disease that turns<br />\nthe victim's immune system<br />\nagainst him. Dr. K. Johnson explained his theory that the environmental influence, the virus,<br />\nresults in the normal development<br />\nof antibodies. These antibodies<br />\nrecognize the original virus by the<br />\npresence of specific proteins on<br />\nthe cells it invades, called antigens, and the immune system<br />\nresponds to the antigenic signal<br />\n<br />\nby destroying the virus-infected<br />\ncell. Dr. K. Johnson believes that<br />\nfor some reason, MS patients'<br />\nmyelin exhibits these same antigenic proteins. Thus, the immune system destroys the myelin.<br />\nDr. K. Johnson is investigating<br />\nthe effect of the protein interferon<br />\non the myelin. Interferon is a protein produced by some immunological system cells. He<br />\nthinks that certain forms of interferon may prevent the development of antigens on the myelin. Initial human trials have significantly reduced neurological attacks.<br />\na 350-patient trial began in<br />\nSeptember.<br />\nDr. R. Johnson noted the immunologic abnormalities of MS<br />\nvictims. To the same virus, MS<br />\npatients tend to produce more antibodies than non-MS patients.<br />\nMS patients also have antibodies<br />\nin the fluid surrounding the central nervous system, unlike nonMS patients.<br />\nSAMS's Chairman at Hopkins<br />\nis Jon Roberts, and Vice-Chairman<br />\nis Hal Bowman. Jon explained<br />\nthat the National Multiple<br />\nSclerosis Society started SAMS<br />\nto raise money for MS research,<br />\nwith events like the Dance<br />\nMarathon, a rousing success last<br />\nspring, and coming up again the<br />\nlast weekend of March.

The<br />\ndetective. . . must be a complete<br />\nman and a common man and yet<br />\nan unusual man. He must be, to<br />\nuse a rather weathered phrase, a<br />\nman of honor. . .

Chandler<br />\nsaid, \". . . the detective exists<br />\ncomplete and entire and unchanged by anything that happens, that<br />\nhe is, as detective, outside the<br />\nstory and above it, and always<br />\nwill be. That is why he never gets<br />\nthe girl, never marries, never<br />\nreally has a private life, except insofar as he must eat and sleep and<br />\nhave a place to leave his clothes.<br />\nHis moral and intellectual force<br />\nis that he gets nothing but his fee,<br />\nfor which he will, if he can, protect the innocent, guard the<br />\nhelpless and destroy the wicked,<br />\nand the fact that he must do this<br />\nwhile earning a meager living in<br />\na corrupt world is what makes<br />\nhim stand out.\"<br />\nMarlowe is a man who managed to be noble in a corrupt world.<br />\nHe takes his fee and nothing else.<br />\nHe never lets himself be corrupted, and above all, he never<br />\ncheats anyone.

Therefore, his first goal<br />\nwas to bring the Blue Jays back<br />\nup to .500. However, after winning five of his last seven games<br />\nand finishing 12-12 last season,<br />\nNelson's goals have changed<br />\nslightly as he enters his third<br />\nseason as head coach at Hopkins.<br />\n\"Somehow, we want to get to<br />\npost-season play,\" said Nelson,<br />\nwhose career coaching mark now<br />\nstands at 123-80.<br />\nThe Blue Jays came very close<br />\nto making the MAC playoffs last<br />\nseason, but a heartbreaking loss<br />\nto Washington College ended<br />\nHopkins's cinderella bid. Despite<br />\nthe loss, the game was the<br />\nhighlight of the season, as the<br />\nNewton White Athletic Center<br />\nwas filled to capacity for the first<br />\n<br />\ntime in recent memory. Everyone<br />\nwho was there to witness the<br />\n84-76 Shoremen victory could<br />\nsense the new excitement surrounding Hopkins basketball. And<br />\nwith all of last year's starters<br />\nreturning, that excitement is<br />\nbound to spill over into the 198889 campaign.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are one of the<br />\npre-season favorites in the MAC<br />\nSouthern Division, but they will<br />\nhave to struggle to become one of<br />\nthe two teams which will represent the division in the MAC<br />\nplayoffs. Washington College<br />\nwill once again field an awesome<br />\nlineup, as they are again loaded<br />\nwith big, talented players. Ursinus returns four of five starters<br />\nfrom a team which finished second in the division last season,<br />\nand Widener will be tough as<br />\nusual. But added to the difficult<br />\nMAC schedule, Hopkins will<br />\nface all eight teams in the UAA<br />\nthis season. Competing in both<br />\nconferences will make the Blue<br />\n<br />\nJays' schedule one of the most difficult in Division III and will also<br />\nforce Hopkins to do a lot more<br />\ntravelling than they've done in the<br />\npast.<br />\n\"It will be an adjustment for<br />\nthe team. We'll have to reach<br />\nback a little further to compensate<br />\nfor the extra travel and the<br />\ntougher schedule,\" commented<br />\nNelson. \"Even though we have<br />\neveryone back, our program will<br />\nbe changed with the UAA games,<br />\nand it will be a challenge to get<br />\nready.\"<br />\nNelson has the guns to meet<br />\nthat challenge, as the Jays did not<br />\nlose a single player from last<br />\nyear's team to graduation. Mike<br />\nLatimore, a 6'5\" forward,<br />\nreturns after an outstanding<br />\nseason in 87-88. He led Hopkins<br />\nin rebounding and was named to<br />\nthe First Team All MACSouthern Division squad. Also<br />\nreturning are all of last season's<br />\nphenomenal freshmen, led by<br />\nguard Andy Enfield. Enfield led<br />\n<br />\nthe Blue Jays in scoring by<br />\naveraging 15.2 points per game,<br />\nand he was named the Southern<br />\nDivision's Rookie of the Year.<br />\nJedan Phillips, one of the most<br />\nprolific scorers in Hopkins<br />\nhistory, will be back for his<br />\nfourth and final season.<br />\nThe Jays, however, have not<br />\nhad a good pre-season so far, due<br />\nto some key injuries. Point guard<br />\nDave Eikenberg broke his foot in<br />\nthe late summer, and has still not<br />\ncome back to one hundred percent. Senior Greg Characklis has<br />\nbattled injury problems, and two of<br />\nHopkins's top freshman recruits<br />\nhave been sidelined recently. The<br />\nbiggest loss, however, is the<br />\nabsence of Jim Timmerman.<br />\nTimmerman, who came off the<br />\nbench at the end of last season to<br />\nspark the Blue Jays' turnaround,<br />\nwill sit out this season to concentrate on baseball.<br />\nBesides injuries, Hopkins's<br />\nbiggest problems will be on the<br />\nboards. Though three of this<br />\n<br />\nyear's freshmen are over 6'4\",<br />\nthe Jays still lack a true center to<br />\nhelp Latimore on the inside. To<br />\nmake up for their lack of height,<br />\nthey will rely on their tremendous<br />\noutside shooting and defense.<br />\nTo help develop a stronger<br />\ndefense, Bob McConce has joined Hopkins as an Assistant<br />\nCoach. McCone comes from<br />\nAberdeen High, where in ten<br />\nyears as head coach he racked up<br />\n200 victories. Ed Richardson<br />\nreturns as the other assistant, and<br />\nhe will be handling the JV program as well.<br />\nHopkins's biggest weapon will<br />\nbe the fan support. In the last half<br />\nof the 1987-88 season, the Blue<br />\nJays were unstoppable in front of<br />\nthe noisy crowd in the Newton<br />\nWhite Athletic Center. With<br />\noutstanding young talent and a<br />\nraucous crowd, Johns Hopkins<br />\nhas become one of the most<br />\nfeared places for MAC opponents<br />\nto visit. And this year, UAA<br />\nteams will find out why.<br />\n<br />\nThe 1988-89 Hopkins Varsity Basketball Team<br />\n<br />\nGREG CHARACKLIs, Senior, 6'3\",<br />\n190 lbs., Bozeman, MT<br />\n<br />\nJOEL SIEPIERSKI, Junior, 6'8\", 220<br />\nlbs., Williamsville, NY<br />\n<br />\nBILL ZAHN, Sophomore, 6'5\", 180<br />\nlbs., East Brunswick, NJ<br />\n<br />\nMARK WEST, Freshman, 6'4\", 180<br />\nlbs., Camp Hill, PA<br />\n<br />\nGreg was a starter at the beginning of last<br />\nseason, but was relegated to a reserve role<br />\nlater in the year. He will come off the<br />\nbench again this year and will be expected<br />\nto provide an offensive spark. He is an excellent shooter and has good three point<br />\nrange.<br />\n<br />\nJoel has a surprising shooting touch for<br />\na big man and was second in the Southern<br />\nDivision with a shooting percentage of<br />\n54.9 last year. He also hit 80 percent of<br />\nhis foul shots. If his rebounding improves,<br />\nhe will become an awesome inside threat<br />\nwith tremendous scoring ability.<br />\n<br />\nBill was one of the most pleasant surprises for Coach Nelson last season, as he<br />\ngreatly improved as the year progressed.<br />\nHe has an outstanding shooting touch,<br />\nespecially from the corners. His perimeter<br />\nshooting should open up the inside for the<br />\nother big men.<br />\n<br />\nMark fits the mold of the typical<br />\nHopkins recruit these days. He is extremely versatile and can play anywhere on the<br />\nfloor. He will see most of his playing time<br />\nat point guard or off-guard, where his solid<br />\nshooting range will make him a scoring<br />\nthreat.<br />\n<br />\nEVAN JONES, Freshman, 6'5\", 175<br />\nlbs., Eugene, OR<br />\n<br />\nKEVIN ROLLER, Junior, 6'2\", 170<br />\nlbs., Marion, MA<br />\n<br />\nERIC HASTINGS, Sophomore, 6'5\",<br />\n205 lbs., Baltimore, MD<br />\n<br />\nJedan enters his senior year as one of the<br />\nEvan is a very versatile player, as he<br />\nleading scorers in Hopkins history.

On<br />\nMonday, November 7, at Caesar's<br />\nPalace in Las Vegas, Sugar Ray<br />\nknocked out Lalonde in the ninth<br />\nround, winning two title belts.<br />\nThere was a great deal of prefight publicity in this one, as is so<br />\ncommon to any major bout.<br />\nLalonde, in a powerful, convincing voice, said on a television<br />\ncommercial,\"I'm going to make<br />\nhim fight every second of the<br />\nfight. I'm going to force him to<br />\nfight and take him out of his<br />\ngroove. Once he's pushed beyond<br />\nhis groove, I'll start getting to<br />\nhim.\"<br />\nLeonard, the 3-1 betting<br />\n'We're Right In Your Backyard'<br />\nfavorite, before the fight depicted<br />\nLalonde as a weak fighter who<br />\nlacked mobility. He called him a<br />\none punch right hand fighter who<br />\nwas too slow to do the damage<br />\nthat Lalonde speculated he'd do.<br />\nHe fought a great fight, surprising many, and even knocked<br />\nLeonard down in the fourth.<br />\nLeonard had the momentum and<br />\nendurance, though, to end the<br />\nfight in the ninth round.<br />\nOne thing that confuses many<br />\nis why Leonard keeps on coming<br />\nout of retirement. When he announced his second retirement<br />\nafter defeating Hagler, he had<br />\nmade $50 million as a boxer and<br />\nwas prepared to live a non-violent<br />\nlife with his wife and two kids in<br />\nhis mansion in Potomac,<br />\nMaryland. It is a well known fact<br />\nthat a boxer who hangs around<br />\nthe ring too long will eventually<br />\nrealize disappointment, both<br />\nphysically and<br />\nmentally.<br />\nLeonard's response is, \"If you do<br />\nit well, why not do it? People tell<br />\nme they can't come back every<br />\nyear. Maybe they can't. I can.\"<br />\nLeonard seems to be very influential in the sport of boxing.<br />\nHe let it be known that he wanted<br />\nto fight for two titles and all of<br />\na sudden the W.B.C. created a<br />\nnew super-middleweight division.

Yet despite<br />\nall of these obstacles, the Jays<br />\nrose to the occasion, met the<br />\nchallenge, and emerged triumphant. Led once again by the<br />\nfreshman sensation John Robinson, the Jays flew to a fifth place<br />\nteam finish, one of its highest<br />\never. Traditionally, the men do<br />\nwell at MAC's, operating on the<br />\nprinciple that the Championship<br />\nis the only meet that really matters, with all the others just acting as preparations for this race.<br />\nThus, the success of a season is<br />\njudged by the team's performance<br />\nat MAC's, and this year Hopkins<br />\nperformed better than expected.<br />\nThe Jays caught five teams who<br />\nhad beaten them during the<br />\ncourse of the season, including<br />\n<br />\nFranklin & Marshall who beat<br />\nHopkins last week by I point. At<br />\nMAC's, the Jays turned the tables<br />\nand crushed the Diplomats by 47<br />\npoints, hardly a close call. The<br />\nJays also beat Scranton University, Lebanon Valley College,<br />\nMoravian college, and Messiah<br />\nCollege, all of whom had<br />\ndefeated the Jays at the Kickinson<br />\nInvitational at the beginning of<br />\nOctober. However, the best each<br />\nof these teams could do on Saturday was watch the backs of<br />\nHopkins uniforms as the men of<br />\nJHU blew by them.<br />\nThe success of the team was,<br />\nof course, a direct result of the<br />\nsuccess enjoyed by the individual<br />\nmen. John Robinson led the men<br />\nwith an incredible performance<br />\nwhich earned him first team AllMAC honors as a freshman. He<br />\nfinished seventh place overall in<br />\nthe race with an unbelievable time<br />\nof 26 minutes and 34 seconds for<br />\nthe five mile race. This fantastic<br />\nperformance was supported by a<br />\nremarkable team effort from the<br />\nsecond through fifth runners for<br />\nHopkins. Junior Erik Schweitzer<br />\nled the rest of the Hopkins pack<br />\nand finished in 34th place. He<br />\n<br />\nwsa followed closely by Senior<br />\nCo-Captain Dan Dairaghi, who<br />\ncame in seven seconds later to<br />\nfinish 38th. Freshman Manny<br />\nHostin came in strong at the end<br />\nto finish a second later in 40th<br />\nplace with a time of 27:41. Senior<br />\nCo-Captain Scott Baker rounded<br />\nout the scoring with a 52nd place<br />\nfinish.<br />\nIt was this pack that allowed<br />\nHopkins to place so high in the<br />\nteam scoring. Last year, Hopkins<br />\nhad the winner of the race, its second runner in 50th place, while<br />\nthis year the fifth runner finished<br />\nin 52nd, a significant improvement as a team. The team shows<br />\npromise for the future, as<br />\nsophomore Chris Crosby and<br />\nfreshman Tyrone Fillyaw ran<br />\nsixth and seventh for the team and<br />\nfinished at 29:07 and 29:10<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAlso deserving of recognition<br />\nfor this victory is Coach Jim<br />\nGrogan who once again managed to have his team peak perfectly for the championship race.<br />\nWhen asked to comment on his<br />\nteam's performance, Coach<br />\nGrogan replied, \"I'm happy!\"<br />\nT es indeed, and rightfully so.<br />\n<br />\nPat's All-Pro Picks Football<br />\n(home team in caps)<br />\nLast week: 10-4-0<br />\nSeason:51-46-1<br />\n<br />\n4E<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\nX<br />\nX<br />\nX<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nFOOTBALL, from 23<br />\n<br />\nAll-Centennial.

The<br />\nfirst was assisted by McKiernan<br />\non a cross, and the second came<br />\non a rebound of a missed shot.<br />\nTodd Marshall made a super effort in scoring the team's final<br />\ngoal of the season off an assist<br />\nfrom Greg Bronshvag.

While overall non-salary<br />\nbudget, including funding to support teaching assistants, increased nominally by five and a half<br />\npercent, funding for the math<br />\ndepartment has increased by fifteen to twenty percent.<br />\nThat is, by far, the highest increase of all departments.

Although the<br />\nforeign students are not required<br />\nto take English courses, they are<br />\nstrongly encouraged to do so.<br />\nMeyer points out, however,<br />\nthat the problem lies in the<br />\nunavailability of conversational<br />\nEnglish courses.<br />\n\"They've learned grammar and<br />\ncan read [English],\" said Meyer,<br />\n\"but they can't speak it.

He attempted to establish that periods<br />\nof prolonged deficit actually<br />\nmake consumers feel wealthier,<br />\nand therefore encourage them to<br />\nspend more money.<br />\nEisner had charts which tied the<br />\nlevel of the deficit closely with<br />\nthe growth of real gross national<br />\nproduct, the level of employment,<br />\nand the value of the Dow Jones<br />\nIndustrial Average. In fact, he<br />\nsaid, \"those who blamed the<br />\nstock crash of 1987 on the budget<br />\ndeficit were dead wrong. There<br />\nwas a sharp decline in the deficit<br />\nright before the crash.\"<br />\nEisner was questioned as to<br />\nhow the government measures its<br />\nbudget deficit. He said, \"The<br />\nbudget deficit necessarily includes an inflation tax because the<br />\nreal value of the dollar also influences the real terms of the<br />\ndebt.\"<br />\nHe strongly challenged the<br />\nKeynesian model of economics,<br />\nwhich suggests that deficit spending necessarily ignores inflation.<br />\nHe argued, \"If you have a deficit<br />\nwhich increases at the rate of inflation annually, then no real debt<br />\nis accumulated.\" He noted that if<br />\nstate budget spending, net<br />\ngovernment investment, and the<br />\n\"inflation tax\" for fiscal 1988<br />\nwere considered, the government<br />\nwould actually have a surplus.<br />\nHe also argued the importance<br />\nof considering the federal debt in<br />\nterms of percentage of the GNP,<br />\nthat is, the net debt per capita. He<br />\nsaid, \"If you compare the net<br />\ndebt today, you'll find it's much<br />\nlower than at some other poit,ts<br /><br />\nsince 1945.\"\u201e<br />\nEisner also pointed out that<br />\nwhile the net worth of government may have dropped because<br />\nof the budget deficit, its relevant<br />\nworth has not. \"The relevant<br />\nworth shows what the government is actually acquiring through<br />\ntaxes and other sources rather<br />\nthan what it owns in terms of property,\" said Eisner.<br />\nHe also showed that the<br />\ngovernment measures its deficit<br />\nin terms of all investments at current expenditure, but to be consistent it should only include<br />\ndepreciation rather than capital<br />\nspending.<br />\nHe further argued, \"Those<br />\nwho say the budget deficit jeopardizes our children's future are ignoring the facts.\" He strongly<br />\nsuggested that capital was the<br />\nmain factor for guaranteeing the<br />\nfuture, and that capital is not<br />\nalways influenced by the deficit.<br />\n\"The problem is that most people seem to think capital is only<br />\nindustrial machinery,\" said<br />\nEisner. \"Capital is also roads,<br />\nbridges, dams, and other things.\"<br />\nCapital, he said, has been increasing strongly regardless of the<br />\ndeficit.<br />\nEisner also said those who<br />\nwere dedicated to slashing the<br />\nbudget deficit could create more<br />\nharm than good.

After<br />\nall, it is in the best interest of everyone<br />\nto ensure that academic issues be addressed responsibly and swiftly. The<br />\nproblem that faces us today is that of requiring teaching assistants from foreign<br />\nlands to face more stringent English<br />\nlanguage requirements.<br /><br />\nfurther into topics that the professor can<br />\nonly touch upon in lecture. A student<br />\nwith a question cannot hope to gain insight from someone with only a cursory<br />\nability to relay the answer.<br /><br />\nFurthermore, the foreign student who<br />\ncomes to Hopkins without a good<br />\nunderstanding of English is also<br />\ndefeated.

I'm<br />\nafraid we have something very<br />\nimportant to discuss, and I hope<br />\nyou won't take offense.\"<br />\nEbenezer growled from deep in<br />\nhis throat.<br />\n\"What?\"<br />\n\"It has been brought to my attention that a group of you down<br />\nat the Hopkins Club.<br />\n\"The Magnolia Club,\" corrected Ebenezer.<br />\n\". . . have been engaged in,<br />\nhow shall I put it, covert activities<br />\non campus?\"<br />\n\"I don't know what you're<br />\ntalking about.\"<br />\nEbenezer shuffled through<br />\nMuller's cigar box, finally extracting a cigar and examining it<br />\nthoughtfully.<br />\n\"I'm afraid you do.

Since you<br />\nfellows were no longer allowed to<br />\nban women to a back room<br />\nbehind the kitchen there, or keep<br />\npeople out who couldn't produce<br />\nlily-white family lineages, there<br />\nhas been a steady rise in sabotage<br />\nand we are just unable to cover<br />\nup for it any longer.\"<br />\n\"1975,\" grumbled Ebenezer,<br />\n\"a bad, bad year.\"<br />\n\"At first you guys were pretty<br />\nlow key, I must admit.

Earlier this year,<br />\nthe Union of Jewish Graduate<br />\nStudents requested $1200 from<br />\nthe GRO to hold a Talmudic<br />\nreading series. When the GRO inquired how much financial support the Chaplain was providing,<br />\nthey were told $100. Two weeks<br />\nago, on the other hand, I heard<br />\nfrom a member of the Graduates<br />\nfor Social Responsbility that they<br />\nwere promised $800 to invite Abby Hoffman to campus.<br />\nThe Chaplain's Sunday experience, in advertising \"The<br />\nCandidate\" distributed a reprint<br />\nof a Vanity Fair article that mocks<br />\nDan Quayle. While it is not my<br />\nintention to defend Quayle, I find<br />\nit disturbing to see the Chaplain's<br />\noffice effectively endorsing a candidate before the elections.<br />\nLast year, the College<br />\nRepublicans, among others, complained that the Chaplain is sponsoring a fast for the benefit of Oxfam, an ostensibly charitable<br />\norganizaiton that has been known<br />\nto have provided support to the<br />\nSandinistas and the Angolan<br />\ngovernment. Following the controversy, the Chaplain promised<br />\nto have a politically neutral charity represented during the<br />\nfundraising effort. Ignoring her<br />\nown promise, the Chaplain intends to sponsor the fast this year<br />\nwithout an alternate politically<br />\nneutral charity.<br />\nIt has become evident that<br />\nChaplain Van Utt is not adhering<br />\nto the mandate of her office, but<br />\nrather using her office to promote<br />\nher own leftist political agenda.<br />\nThe SAC and GRO always provide financial support to political<br />\nevents of all kinds. There is absolutely no excuse why the<br />\nChaplain should be spending her<br />\nbudget on political events while<br />\ndenying sufficient funds to<br />\nreligious groups which should be<br />\nher primary concern. I hope that<br />\nthe student body realizes the<br />\ngravity of the Chaplain's alarming tendency and will help put an<br />\nend to this abuse of university<br />\nfunds and office.<br /><br />\nSecond, Mr. Mordkoff is correct when he implies that our efforts to ameliorate the current<br />\nsituation in this area have been<br />\nperceived as promoting a heavily anti-foreign feeling on campus.<br />\nLet me assure everyone that it has<br />\nnot been, nor will it ever be, my<br />\nintention in this effort to alienate<br />\nthe members of the foreign<br />\ngraduate student community at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Rather, my hope<br />\nis to improve what appears to be<br />\na difficult status quo for foreign<br />\ngrad students, as well as<br />\nundergrads.<br />\nWhile Toby Mordkoff does<br />\nmake some valid points in his letter, he also makes points which<br />\nlack validity. First, it is absolutely<br />\ncriminal for him to suggest that<br />\nbecause Johns Hopkins is<br />\nprimarily a research institution,<br />\nthe undergraduates, who pay to<br />\nattend this university, should grin<br />\nand bear incomprehensible instructors for the sake of departmental research. Second, what is<br />\nat issue here is not the ability of<br />\nforeign graduate teaching<br />\nassistants to speak English \"as<br />\nwell as we [as Americans] would<br />\nlike, but instead their ability to<br />\nspeak English at all . Third, Mr.<br />\nMordkoff is again wrong when he<br />\nsuggests that my solution to this<br />\nproblem is a new rule. What we<br />\nare seeking to implement is a<br />\ncomprehensive policy which will<br />\naccomodate the needs of both<br />\nnew and continuing foreign<br />\ngraduate teaching assistants, as<br />\nwell as the undergraduates,<br />\ndepartments, and the administration.<br />\nYes, Mr. Mordkoff, we are<br />\ntalking about people, people who<br />\ncome from nations around the<br />\nglobe, who are completely unfamiliar with this nation, who are<br />\nexpected not only to master<br />\nchallenging academic work and<br />\nthe peculiarities of life in<br />\nAmerica, but also instruct<br />\nundergraduates, all without the<br />\nability to communicate in the<br />\nlanguage in which our lives, both<br />\npersonal and professional, are<br />\nconducted.<br />\nMr. Mordkoff calls me \"selfcentered\" and claims I \"ignore<br />\nreality. If serving my fellow<br />\nundergraduate portends my<br />\negotism and ignorance then I will<br />\neagerly continue to work for what<br />\nis right, while sacrificing universal admiration and omniscience.<br /><br />\nOussama Himani<br />\nJeff DeCagna<br /><br />\nTA's and English<br />\nPhi Psi complaint<br />\nTo the E-ditors:<br />\nI would like to respond to J.<br />\nToby Mordkoffs letter regarding<br />\nmy position on the issue of<br />\nlanguage proficiency among<br />\nforeign graduate students who act<br />\nas teaching assistants.<br />\nFirst, Mr. Mordkoff is quite<br />\ncorrect when he states that<br />\nAmerica benefits from the immigration of high-caliber<br />\ngraduate students from around the<br />\nworld to our country to study.<br />\nWhat he fails to recognize is that<br />\na foreign graduate teaching assistant of superior intellectual ability does not benefit an<br />\nundergraduate student if that<br />\nT.A. does not posses the<br />\nnecesssary tool to share his (or<br />\nher) knowledge, i.e., and ability<br />\nto communicate in English.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Saturday, October 29,<br />\n1988, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity<br />\nhosted its eighth annual Phi Psi<br />\n500 fundraiser on the Gilman<br />\nQuad. Aside from being a major<br />\nsocial event and parents weekend<br />\nattraction, this event was one of<br />\nthe biggest student-organized<br />\ncharity fundraisers ever at<br />\nHopkins. Phi Psi, Homewood<br />\nundergraduates, graduates, and<br />\nfaculty, as well as neighborhood<br />\nresidents, raised over $2000.00<br />\nfor Santa Claus Anonymous. This<br />\nyear's 500 was a shining example of how the Homewood community, with all its diversity,<br />\ncould work together towards a<br />\ncharitable goal.<br /><br />\nPreviously, it had been our<br />\nunderstanding that the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter, above all, functioned as an organ of communication<br />\nfor the Homewood campus. In<br />\nthis light it seems inconceivable<br />\nthat an event of such potential interest to the Hopkins Community could have been neglected by<br />\nthe News-Letter staff. This is<br />\nespecially disconcerting when<br />\none considers that the Gazette ,<br />\na tabloid which serves the entire<br />\nnetwork of Johns Hopkins institutions, gave the Phi Psi 500 front<br />\npage coverage.<br />\nThe decision on the part of the<br />\nNews-Letter staff to ignore this<br />\nyear's Phi Psi 500 was negligent.<br />\nWe sincerely hope this failing of<br />\nthe News-Letter in its primary<br />\nresponsibility to effectively report<br />\nnews at Homewood is not a<br />\nprecedent for the future.<br />\nMurat Akalin<br />\nAvram Frankel<br /><br />\nThe N-L's great!!<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI just wanted to tell you that the<br />\narticle Jon Stempel did for the<br />\nNovember 4 issue of the NewsLetter on student housing was excellent. It was well researched,<br />\nclearly written, and generally one<br />\nof the best and more objective<br />\npieces of student journalism I've<br />\nseen in a while.<br />\nA regular reader of the NewsLetter since I was a student in the<br />\nearly 60's, I have long familiarity with the paper and its writing.<br />\nI do appreciate his good work.<br />\nWilliam J.

Just a few blocks south<br />\nof the campus, at 32 W. 25th<br />\nStreet is the Kelmscott Bookshop.<br />\nIt is the most serious and professionally managed dealership in<br />\nBaltimore specializing in old and<br />\nrare books. Also on 25th Street,<br />\nat 8 W., is the Tiber Bookshop.<br />\nBoth are so close to the campus<br />\nthat they should not be left off<br />\neven a selective listing.<br />\nGeorge Krotkoff<br />\nThe writer is Associate Professor<br />\nin the Dept. of Near Eastern<br />\nStudies.<br /><br />\nI'm sorry that your paper<br />\nmisrepresented my point of view<br />\non the Hopkins housing situation.<br />\nHowever, it did an excellent job<br />\nin making me the number one<br />\nenemy of all the community<br />\nassistants. Unfortunately, as a<br />\nHousemaster, the community<br />\nassistants are my close colleagues<br />\nand you have done yourself well<br />\nto create an awkward working<br />\nsituation.<br />\nStudent housing for upperclassmen is a problem. The<br />\nfact of the matter is I personally<br />\nhave never been involved with the<br />\nWolman/McCoy community.<br />\nHowever, from my experience in<br />\nan off-campus apartment, I<br />\nprefer the social advantages of<br />\nliving in the dorms. Apartments<br />\ncan isolate people; that is why I<br />\nbelieve it is difficult to maintain<br /><br />\na strong Wolman/McCoy community. As a Housemaster I am<br />\nrequired to have dorm programs<br />\nfor the freshmen at least three<br />\ntimes a month. The community<br />\nassistants have the same requirement; they probably even need to<br />\ndo more programs. I have suffered the frustration of brainbusting for a dorm program,<br />\nadvertising for it, and having very<br />\nfew people show up. And I live<br />\non campus with a bunch of eager,<br />\nenthusiastic freshmen in a dorm<br />\nsetting. If! can't get people who<br />\nwalk by my room regularly to<br />\nstop in for a program, I can imagine how hard it is to do a program for upperclassmen living in<br />\nan apartment setting. Therefore,<br />\nI appreciate greatly the hard work<br />\nof the community assistants but it<br />\nisn't their fault that their residents<br />\nlive in apartments. I'm sorry if<br />\nthe community assistants are<br />\nupset with the article and I can<br />\nassure them that what was quoted<br />\nof me was not my true sentiment.<br />\nJ.J.

To be honest,<br />\nI've never been a fervent U2 fan<br />\nand I've never seen them in concert. Boy and War are brilliant<br />\nalbums. I'll admit, but not quite<br /><br />\nmy speed, while the later LPs,<br />\nThe Unforgettable Fire and The<br />\nJoshua Tree, are truly admirable,<br />\nbut for me, only in a vague, saccharine sort of way. The U2<br />\npresented here, however, the one<br />\nstripped of media and studio<br />\nsheen and polish, is gritty, raw,<br />\ncharismatic, possessed, and<br />\nwholly sincere in its vision of<br />\nrock and roll. If bandmen Bono,<br />\nThe Edge, Larry Mullen, and<br />\nAdam Clayton, are at all likable<br /><br />\nin this film, it's purely because<br />\nthey're so unpredictably nononsense; nothing is glossed over.<br />\nA favored scene: Minutes before<br />\nthe \"Save the Yuppie Free Concert\" given in San Francisco last<br />\nfall. The band has decided to<br />\ncover Bob Dylan's \"All Along<br />\nthe Watchtower\" and the tenable<br />\nnervous energy as a) Bono tries<br />\nto simultaneously sing and learn<br />\nthe words (they're written on 3\"<br />\nX 5\" sheets of paper, which he<br /><br />\nshuffles continually) and b) The queer, dreamlike authority.

The children of<br />\nthese immigrants, however, show<br />\na decrease in the \"Japanese\"<br />\ncancers and an increase in the<br />\n\"U.S.\" cancers.

Avoidance consists<br />\nof \"protection and prevention.\"<br />\nPrevention involves reduction in<br />\ncigarette consumption and radiation in the environment. Protection involves the \"establishment<br />\nof a state of reduced susceptibility to carcinogens,\" according to<br />\nTalalay.<br />\nTalalay concluded by focusing<br />\non some methods used to<br />\ndecrease human susceptibility to<br />\ncancer-causing agents, describing<br />\nsome of the pioneering work done<br />\nin his laboratory.<br />\nThe first such analysis of carcinogenic substances was in the<br />\n1700's, when it was discovered<br />\nthat chimney sweeps had a high<br />\nincidence of cancer of the<br />\nscrotum. At that time it was suggested as a solution that the<br />\nscrotum simply be removed.<br />\nLater it was discovered that benzopyrene\u2014a hydrocarbon presently<br />\nfound in automobile exhaust<br />\nwith \"pleasant, but lethal<br />\nshapes\"--caused the cancer. It<br />\nwas subsequently found that other<br />\nchemicals could block the carcinogenicity of benzopyrene.<br />\nThe same was found true of azo<br />\ndye, called \"butter yellow,\"<br /><br />\nformerly used in the Orient to<br />\ncolor butter. Laboratory experiments showed that this dye<br />\ncaused a quick-spreading cancer<br />\nof the liver in 100 percent of the<br />\nrats studied. When treated with<br />\nan aromatic organic compound,<br />\nthis cancer rate decreases to 17<br />\npercent.<br />\nTalalay explains that the carcinogenicity is blocked by<br />\nstimulating enzymes in the liver<br />\nthat break down the dye and<br />\nrender it inactive and unable to<br />\ncause cancer. Examples of such<br />\nchemicals are BHA and BHT,<br />\ncalled phenolic antioxidants,<br />\nfound in many foods. Many other<br />\nblockers of chemical carcinogenesis<br />\nhave<br />\nbeen<br />\ndiscovered, all affecting the way<br />\nthe body processes the carcinogenic chemical.<br />\nUltimately, says Talalay, the<br />\ncontrol of carcinogenesis arises<br />\nfrom the balance of activating and<br />\ninactivating enzymes\u2014those enzymes that either aid or block the<br />\nprocessing of the chemical<br />\nthrough the body. Talalay has<br />\nfound that different vegetables,<br />\nsuch as broccoli, celery, and<br />\nginger, block certain carcinogenic<br />\nsubstances. He hopes to discover<br />\nhow such compounds block the<br />\ncarcinogens, and hopes to find<br />\nother substances that will provide<br />\na similar benefit in the fight<br />\nagainst cancer.<br /><br />\nfeolfwA<br />\nWatiliarval<br />\nTHANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE<br />\n1988 FAST FOR A WORLD HARVEST on<br />\nNovember 17, and for your contributions to<br />\nOxfam America and/or Manna House soup<br />\nkitchen of Baltimore City.<br />\n. . . gentle reminders. . .<br />\n1) Please leave your MEAL CARDS in the<br />\nTerrace Room after dinner on the evening<br />\nof November 16.

These initial attacks<br />\nare highly variable, affecting<br />\nsight, speech, movement, or intellectual functions. Problems like<br />\nblindness in one eye or numbness<br />\nfrom the waist down develop<br />\nquickly over two to three days,<br />\nlast a few months, and then<br />\ngradually disappear. Attacks<br />\nbecome more frequent over the<br />\nyears, and recovery becomes less<br />\nand less complete. The victim<br />\nbecomes increasingly handicapped. MS almost always ends in<br />\ndeath 30 to 35 years from<br />\ndiagnosis.<br />\nThis general pattern of MS<br />\nsometimes leads to psychological<br />\nproblems. While most of their<br />\npeers are looking ahead to bright<br />\nfutures, MS patients often worry<br />\nabout what new handicap the<br />\nfuture will bring. They can't plan<br />\na family or start a career when, in<br />\na few months, they may be partially blind; a few years later, unable to think.<br />\nApproximately one-fifth of MS<br />\npatients suffer acute and continuous impairment.

A nationally acknowledged expert in MS, he is the director of the Maryland Center for<br />\nMultiple Sclerosis.<br />\nDr. Richard Johnson lectured<br />\non November 7. The two are not<br />\nrelated, but Dr. K. Johnson<br />\nstudied under Dr. R. Johnson at<br />\nthe Case Western Reserve<br />\nUniversity. Dr. R. Johnson is<br />\nProfessor and Director of the<br />\nDepartment of Neurology and<br />\nNeurologist-in-Chief at Hopkins<br />\nHospital, as well as Professor of<br />\nMicrobiology and Neuroscience<br />\nat the Medical School with a joint<br />\nappointment at Public Health. He<br />\nspecializes in viral infections of<br />\nthe nervous system. He chairs the<br />\nMedical Advisory Board for the<br />\nMultiple Sclerosis Society.<br />\nMS is a demyelinating disease,<br />\nmeaning it attacks the protective<br />\nsheath of protein myelin from the<br />\nnerve fibers. Once this layer of<br />\ninsulation is gone, the messages<br />\nof sensory perception, muscular<br />\nmovement, and thought do not<br /><br />\nreach their destination as quickly<br />\nor as completely as they do over<br />\nnormal nerve fibers. Since the<br />\nmessages are slower and weaker,<br />\nthe functions they govern are impaired. To the victim, this means<br />\nparalysis, blindness, slowed<br />\nthought processes, and other handicaps. The initial demyelination<br />\nleads to excess fluid around the<br />\nnerve, which hampers transmission further. As this fluid is reabsorbed. much the same way that<br />\nthe swelling of a bruise recedes,<br />\nfunction gradually returns.<br />\nHowever, the myelin does not<br />\ngrow back, and the cumulative effects of neurological attacks eventually cripple the brain.<br />\nThe cause of MS is uncertain,<br />\nbut three contributing factors<br />\nhave been identified: genetics,<br />\nenvironment, and the actual agent<br />\nof demylination, the immune<br />\nsystem. MS is not directly inherited; rather, one inherits the<br />\ntendency to develop MS. MS<br />\nresearchers have concluded from<br />\nepidemiological studies that<br />\nthe genetic factor is a tendency<br />\nand not a certainty. For example, although identical twins<br />\nhave identical genes, it is common for one twin to have MS and<br />\nthe other to be unafflicted. A vast<br />\nmajority of people with the<br />\ngenetic tendency towards MS<br />\nnever develop it.<br />\nThe disease is extremely rare<br />\namong Orientals and Blacks, and<br />\nits victims are 65 percent female.<br />\nBlacks in the United States have<br />\ndeveloped MS, but genetic screening shows that they have some<br />\nof the caucasian genes linked to<br />\nMS. All other factors constant,<br /><br />\n4,......),............,<br />\nr,* Video Game Contest!:<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nTest your driving skills :<br />\n,<br />\nr<br />\n*<br />\n: . with our very own<br /><br />\nyour chances of developing MS<br />\nif your mother has it are ten times<br />\ngreater, somewhat less if your<br />\nfather has it.<br />\nA second factor is environmental. Epidemiological studies have<br />\ndemonstrated that MS is much<br />\nmore common in the temperate<br />\nzones, specifically the northern<br />\nUnited States and Northern<br />\nEurope. In the US. Northerners<br />\nare twice as likely to develop MS<br />\nas Southerners. Whatever this environmental influence is, it must<br />\nhappen around age thirteen. Intensive research has proven that<br />\nthose who are born in the MS<br />\nregions and later move to<br />\nSouthern latitudes, who move<br />\nbefore adolescence, have a<br />\nSoutherner's chance of developing MS, just as if they had been<br />\nborn in the lower latitudes. Those<br />\nwho moved after adolescence had<br />\nthe potefitial to develop MS as do<br />\nthose who stay in the North their<br />\nwhole lives. Dr. K. Johnson<br />\nsuspects a viral infection, particularly something akin to<br />\nmeasles, while Dr. R. Johnson<br />\nremains uncertain.<br />\nThe ultimate cause of MS is the<br />\nimmune system. MS is an autoimmune disease, a general<br />\ndescription for a disease that turns<br />\nthe victim's immune system<br />\nagainst him. Dr. K. Johnson explained his theory that the environmental influence, the virus,<br />\nresults in the normal development<br />\nof antibodies. These antibodies<br />\nrecognize the original virus by the<br />\npresence of specific proteins on<br />\nthe cells it invades, called antigens, and the immune system<br />\nresponds to the antigenic signal<br /><br />\nby destroying the virus-infected<br />\ncell. Dr. K. Johnson believes that<br />\nfor some reason, MS patients'<br />\nmyelin exhibits these same antigenic proteins. Thus, the immune system destroys the myelin.<br />\nDr. K. Johnson is investigating<br />\nthe effect of the protein interferon<br />\non the myelin. Interferon is a protein produced by some immunological system cells. He<br />\nthinks that certain forms of interferon may prevent the development of antigens on the myelin. Initial human trials have significantly reduced neurological attacks.<br />\na 350-patient trial began in<br />\nSeptember.<br />\nDr. R. Johnson noted the immunologic abnormalities of MS<br />\nvictims. To the same virus, MS<br />\npatients tend to produce more antibodies than non-MS patients.<br />\nMS patients also have antibodies<br />\nin the fluid surrounding the central nervous system, unlike nonMS patients.<br />\nSAMS's Chairman at Hopkins<br />\nis Jon Roberts, and Vice-Chairman<br />\nis Hal Bowman. Jon explained<br />\nthat the National Multiple<br />\nSclerosis Society started SAMS<br />\nto raise money for MS research,<br />\nwith events like the Dance<br />\nMarathon, a rousing success last<br />\nspring, and coming up again the<br />\nlast weekend of March.

Raymond<br />\nChandler's<br />\nPhilip<br />\nMarlowe: A Centennial Celebration marks the 100th anniversary<br />\nof Chandler's birth.<br />\nRaymond Chandler created<br />\nPhilip Marlowe to be the<br />\nquintessential private eye. He<br />\ndescribed the private eye in his<br />\nown words: \"Down these<br />\nmean streets a man must go who<br />\nis not himself mean, who is<br />\nneither tarnished nor afraid. The<br />\ndetective. . . must be a complete<br />\nman and a common man and yet<br />\nan unusual man. He must be, to<br />\nuse a rather weathered phrase, a<br />\nman of honor. . . He talks as the<br />\nman of his age talks, that is, with<br />\nrude wit, a lively sense of the<br />\ngrotesque, a disgust for sham,<br />\nand a contempt for pettiness.\"<br />\nPhilip Marlowe is, in<br />\nChandler's words, \"the personification of an attitude, the exaggeration of a possibility.\"<br />\nChandler's work is unusual<br />\nbecause detective fiction<br />\ntraditionally lacks a substantive<br />\ncharacter. Usually, the characters<br />\nare too busy fighting the bad guys<br />\nto show any of their own<br />\npersonality.<br />\nPhilip Marlowe is the excep-<br /><br />\ntion. He is a person, a man who<br />\nwe can hope exists. Chandler<br />\nsaid, \". . . the detective exists<br />\ncomplete and entire and unchanged by anything that happens, that<br />\nhe is, as detective, outside the<br />\nstory and above it, and always<br />\nwill be. That is why he never gets<br />\nthe girl, never marries, never<br />\nreally has a private life, except insofar as he must eat and sleep and<br />\nhave a place to leave his clothes.<br />\nHis moral and intellectual force<br />\nis that he gets nothing but his fee,<br />\nfor which he will, if he can, protect the innocent, guard the<br />\nhelpless and destroy the wicked,<br />\nand the fact that he must do this<br />\nwhile earning a meager living in<br />\na corrupt world is what makes<br />\nhim stand out.\"<br />\nMarlowe is a man who managed to be noble in a corrupt world.<br />\nHe takes his fee and nothing else.<br />\nHe never lets himself be corrupted, and above all, he never<br />\ncheats anyone. He appeals to us<br />\nbecause he manages to be a person who we wish we were.<br />\nWe want to be noble and fear<br />\nthat it is not possible in this<br />\nworld. Then we meet Marlowe,<br />\na man who deals with the very<br />\nworst in society on a daily basis<br />\nand is still honorable and noble.<br />\nHis appeal is universal.<br />\nAs Chandler created the noble<br />\ndetective, he also created a style.<br />\nHis writing is full of idealism,<br />\nand yet still manages to be real.<br />\nHis descriptions are rich and colorful. We read them and then we<br /><br />\nsee what he is describing.<br />\nIn The Pencil Chandler writes,<br />\n\"The bell chimed inside and after<br />\na while she opened the door in a<br />\npale-blue sports shirt and white<br />\nshorts that were short enough to<br />\nbe friendly. She had gray-blue<br />\neyes, dark red hair, and fine<br />\nbones in her face. There was<br />\nusually a trace of bitterness in the<br />\ngray-blue eyes. She couldn't<br />\nforget that her father's life had<br />\nbeen destroyed by the crooked<br />\npower of a gambling-ship<br />\nmobster, that her mother had died<br />\ntoo.\" In this passage the<br />\ncharacter comes alive and we<br />\nknow her.<br />\nRaymond Chandler's Philip<br />\nMarlowe: A Centennial Celebration is a collection of short stories<br />\nwritten by some of the best<br />\nmystery writers alive. Each has<br />\ntried to recapture the style of<br />\nChandler's writing and the nobility and grittiness of Marlowe.<br />\nSome of the writers succeed so<br />\nwell that the reader forgets that<br />\nthe story was not written by<br />\nChandler.

Therefore, his first goal<br />\nwas to bring the Blue Jays back<br />\nup to .500. However, after winning five of his last seven games<br />\nand finishing 12-12 last season,<br />\nNelson's goals have changed<br />\nslightly as he enters his third<br />\nseason as head coach at Hopkins.<br />\n\"Somehow, we want to get to<br />\npost-season play,\" said Nelson,<br />\nwhose career coaching mark now<br />\nstands at 123-80.<br />\nThe Blue Jays came very close<br />\nto making the MAC playoffs last<br />\nseason, but a heartbreaking loss<br />\nto Washington College ended<br />\nHopkins's cinderella bid. Despite<br />\nthe loss, the game was the<br />\nhighlight of the season, as the<br />\nNewton White Athletic Center<br />\nwas filled to capacity for the first<br /><br />\ntime in recent memory. Everyone<br />\nwho was there to witness the<br />\n84-76 Shoremen victory could<br />\nsense the new excitement surrounding Hopkins basketball. And<br />\nwith all of last year's starters<br />\nreturning, that excitement is<br />\nbound to spill over into the 198889 campaign.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are one of the<br />\npre-season favorites in the MAC<br />\nSouthern Division, but they will<br />\nhave to struggle to become one of<br />\nthe two teams which will represent the division in the MAC<br />\nplayoffs. Washington College<br />\nwill once again field an awesome<br />\nlineup, as they are again loaded<br />\nwith big, talented players. Ursinus returns four of five starters<br />\nfrom a team which finished second in the division last season,<br />\nand Widener will be tough as<br />\nusual. But added to the difficult<br />\nMAC schedule, Hopkins will<br />\nface all eight teams in the UAA<br />\nthis season. Competing in both<br />\nconferences will make the Blue<br /><br />\nJays' schedule one of the most difficult in Division III and will also<br />\nforce Hopkins to do a lot more<br />\ntravelling than they've done in the<br />\npast.<br />\n\"It will be an adjustment for<br />\nthe team. We'll have to reach<br />\nback a little further to compensate<br />\nfor the extra travel and the<br />\ntougher schedule,\" commented<br />\nNelson. \"Even though we have<br />\neveryone back, our program will<br />\nbe changed with the UAA games,<br />\nand it will be a challenge to get<br />\nready.\"<br />\nNelson has the guns to meet<br />\nthat challenge, as the Jays did not<br />\nlose a single player from last<br />\nyear's team to graduation. Mike<br />\nLatimore, a 6'5\" forward,<br />\nreturns after an outstanding<br />\nseason in 87-88. He led Hopkins<br />\nin rebounding and was named to<br />\nthe First Team All MACSouthern Division squad. Also<br />\nreturning are all of last season's<br />\nphenomenal freshmen, led by<br />\nguard Andy Enfield. Enfield led<br /><br />\nthe Blue Jays in scoring by<br />\naveraging 15.2 points per game,<br />\nand he was named the Southern<br />\nDivision's Rookie of the Year.<br />\nJedan Phillips, one of the most<br />\nprolific scorers in Hopkins<br />\nhistory, will be back for his<br />\nfourth and final season.<br />\nThe Jays, however, have not<br />\nhad a good pre-season so far, due<br />\nto some key injuries. Point guard<br />\nDave Eikenberg broke his foot in<br />\nthe late summer, and has still not<br />\ncome back to one hundred percent. Senior Greg Characklis has<br />\nbattled injury problems, and two of<br />\nHopkins's top freshman recruits<br />\nhave been sidelined recently. The<br />\nbiggest loss, however, is the<br />\nabsence of Jim Timmerman.<br />\nTimmerman, who came off the<br />\nbench at the end of last season to<br />\nspark the Blue Jays' turnaround,<br />\nwill sit out this season to concentrate on baseball.<br />\nBesides injuries, Hopkins's<br />\nbiggest problems will be on the<br />\nboards. Though three of this<br /><br />\nyear's freshmen are over 6'4\",<br />\nthe Jays still lack a true center to<br />\nhelp Latimore on the inside. To<br />\nmake up for their lack of height,<br />\nthey will rely on their tremendous<br />\noutside shooting and defense.<br />\nTo help develop a stronger<br />\ndefense, Bob McConce has joined Hopkins as an Assistant<br />\nCoach. McCone comes from<br />\nAberdeen High, where in ten<br />\nyears as head coach he racked up<br />\n200 victories. Ed Richardson<br />\nreturns as the other assistant, and<br />\nhe will be handling the JV program as well.<br />\nHopkins's biggest weapon will<br />\nbe the fan support. In the last half<br />\nof the 1987-88 season, the Blue<br />\nJays were unstoppable in front of<br />\nthe noisy crowd in the Newton<br />\nWhite Athletic Center. With<br />\noutstanding young talent and a<br />\nraucous crowd, Johns Hopkins<br />\nhas become one of the most<br />\nfeared places for MAC opponents<br />\nto visit.

On<br />\nMonday, November 7, at Caesar's<br />\nPalace in Las Vegas, Sugar Ray<br />\nknocked out Lalonde in the ninth<br />\nround, winning two title belts.<br />\nThere was a great deal of prefight publicity in this one, as is so<br />\ncommon to any major bout.<br />\nLalonde, in a powerful, convincing voice, said on a television<br />\ncommercial,\"I'm going to make<br />\nhim fight every second of the<br />\nfight. I'm going to force him to<br />\nfight and take him out of his<br />\ngroove. Once he's pushed beyond<br />\nhis groove, I'll start getting to<br />\nhim.\"<br />\nLeonard, the 3-1 betting<br />\n'We're Right In Your Backyard'<br />\nfavorite, before the fight depicted<br />\nLalonde as a weak fighter who<br />\nlacked mobility. He called him a<br />\none punch right hand fighter who<br />\nwas too slow to do the damage<br />\nthat Lalonde speculated he'd do.<br />\nHe fought a great fight, surprising many, and even knocked<br />\nLeonard down in the fourth.<br />\nLeonard had the momentum and<br />\nendurance, though, to end the<br />\nfight in the ninth round.<br />\nOne thing that confuses many<br />\nis why Leonard keeps on coming<br />\nout of retirement. When he announced his second retirement<br />\nafter defeating Hagler, he had<br />\nmade $50 million as a boxer and<br />\nwas prepared to live a non-violent<br />\nlife with his wife and two kids in<br />\nhis mansion in Potomac,<br />\nMaryland. It is a well known fact<br />\nthat a boxer who hangs around<br />\nthe ring too long will eventually<br />\nrealize disappointment, both<br />\nphysically and<br />\nmentally.<br />\nLeonard's response is, \"If you do<br />\nit well, why not do it? People tell<br />\nme they can't come back every<br />\nyear. Maybe they can't. I can.\"<br />\nLeonard seems to be very influential in the sport of boxing.<br />\nHe let it be known that he wanted<br />\nto fight for two titles and all of<br />\na sudden the W.B.C. created a<br />\nnew super-middleweight division. One of Sugar Ray's friends<br />\nwas quoted as saying, \"Ray's a<br />\nfriend, but I think he's reached<br />\nthe self-deluding point.

The men's team, which<br />\nconsisted of only 13 members due<br />\nto a conflicting water polo tournament, finished sixth. The<br />\nhighest finish of the day came<br />\nfrom junior Mike Costa and<br />\nfreshmen Lars Hondorf, Allen<br /><br />\nGardiner, and Rob Dunn in the<br />\n800 Free Relay. The Lady Jays<br />\nrallied to a 4th place finish,<br />\ndespite a large number of 2nd and<br />\n3rd place finishes by the team.<br />\nOne of the main purposes of the<br />\nmeet, according to Coach Kennedy, was to have fun\u2014and this<br />\ngoal was certainly accomplished.<br />\nSome team members were<br />\nentered in events in which they<br />\nhad not competed since high<br />\nschool, while a few swam an<br />\nevent for the first time. But<br />\namongst all of this lightheartedness, there was some serious swimming. Hopkin.i's performances included personal best<br />\ntimes from Susie Elitzky, Carole<br />\nWendy<br />\nand<br />\nMenetrez,<br /><br />\nFenstamaker in the 100<br />\nbreaststroke, 100 freestyle, and<br />\n500 freestyle respectively.<br />\nThe Jays are looking forward<br />\nto a strong competitive season.<br />\nWhile losing only 4 swimmers to<br />\ngraduation last year, the team has<br />\nadded 15 promising male<br />\nfreshmen and 7 women, including<br />\n2 upperclassmen. Coach Kennedy<br />\nis hoping to improve on last<br />\nyear's NCAA Division III Championship finishes of 7th for the<br />\nmen and 10th for the women.<br />\nLast year's tally of 18 AllAmericans could very well he<br />\ntopped.<br />\nThe Hopkins divers are also<br />\nlooking strong.

Yet despite<br />\nall of these obstacles, the Jays<br />\nrose to the occasion, met the<br />\nchallenge, and emerged triumphant. Led once again by the<br />\nfreshman sensation John Robinson, the Jays flew to a fifth place<br />\nteam finish, one of its highest<br />\never. Traditionally, the men do<br />\nwell at MAC's, operating on the<br />\nprinciple that the Championship<br />\nis the only meet that really matters, with all the others just acting as preparations for this race.<br />\nThus, the success of a season is<br />\njudged by the team's performance<br />\nat MAC's, and this year Hopkins<br />\nperformed better than expected.<br />\nThe Jays caught five teams who<br />\nhad beaten them during the<br />\ncourse of the season, including<br /><br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall who beat<br />\nHopkins last week by I point. At<br />\nMAC's, the Jays turned the tables<br />\nand crushed the Diplomats by 47<br />\npoints, hardly a close call. The<br />\nJays also beat Scranton University, Lebanon Valley College,<br />\nMoravian college, and Messiah<br />\nCollege, all of whom had<br />\ndefeated the Jays at the Kickinson<br />\nInvitational at the beginning of<br />\nOctober. However, the best each<br />\nof these teams could do on Saturday was watch the backs of<br />\nHopkins uniforms as the men of<br />\nJHU blew by them.<br />\nThe success of the team was,<br />\nof course, a direct result of the<br />\nsuccess enjoyed by the individual<br />\nmen. John Robinson led the men<br />\nwith an incredible performance<br />\nwhich earned him first team AllMAC honors as a freshman. He<br />\nfinished seventh place overall in<br />\nthe race with an unbelievable time<br />\nof 26 minutes and 34 seconds for<br />\nthe five mile race. This fantastic<br />\nperformance was supported by a<br />\nremarkable team effort from the<br />\nsecond through fifth runners for<br />\nHopkins. Junior Erik Schweitzer<br />\nled the rest of the Hopkins pack<br />\nand finished in 34th place. He<br /><br />\nwsa followed closely by Senior<br />\nCo-Captain Dan Dairaghi, who<br />\ncame in seven seconds later to<br />\nfinish 38th. Freshman Manny<br />\nHostin came in strong at the end<br />\nto finish a second later in 40th<br />\nplace with a time of 27:41. Senior<br />\nCo-Captain Scott Baker rounded<br />\nout the scoring with a 52nd place<br />\nfinish.<br />\nIt was this pack that allowed<br />\nHopkins to place so high in the<br />\nteam scoring. Last year, Hopkins<br />\nhad the winner of the race, its second runner in 50th place, while<br />\nthis year the fifth runner finished<br />\nin 52nd, a significant improvement as a team. The team shows<br />\npromise for the future, as<br />\nsophomore Chris Crosby and<br />\nfreshman Tyrone Fillyaw ran<br />\nsixth and seventh for the team and<br />\nfinished at 29:07 and 29:10<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAlso deserving of recognition<br />\nfor this victory is Coach Jim<br />\nGrogan who once again managed to have his team peak perfectly for the championship race.<br />\nWhen asked to comment on his<br />\nteam's performance, Coach<br />\nGrogan replied, \"I'm happy!\"<br />\nT es indeed, and rightfully so.<br /><br />\nPat's All-Pro Picks Football<br />\n(home team in caps)<br />\nLast week: 10-4-0<br />\nSeason:51-46-1<br /><br />\n4E<br /><br />\n*<br />\n*<br /><br />\nX<br />\nX<br />\nX<br />\nX<br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nFOOTBALL, from 23<br /><br />\nAll-Centennial.

The four teams which competed for the title were<br />\nWashington College, Frostburg<br />\nState, Salisbury State, and the<br />\ntop-seeded Johns Hopkins Blue<br />\nJays.<br />\nThe Jays played fourth seeded<br />\nWashington College on Saturday<br />\nand won 2-0. The win was the<br />\nteam's seventh in a row, and<br />\nmarked the Jays' tenth shutout of<br />\nthe season. Goalie Jerry Irvine<br />\nalso posted his seventh shutout of<br />\nthe season.<br />\nCraig Weinstein scored his<br />\neighth goal of the season in the first<br />\nhalf after settling a long chip from<br />\nEric Lindenbaum. The next Blue<br />\nJay goal came after Warren Jones<br />\nbeat his man to the right side and<br />\nextended completely to get a pass<br />\noff to Jim McKiernan. McKiernan then beat a Shoremen<br />\ndefender and put the ball in the<br />\nnet for his fifth goal of the season.<br />\n\"Jim had an excellent year,\"<br />\ncommented Coach John Haus<br />\nabout McKiernan. \"He controlled the play for us at the midfield,<br />\nplayed good defense, and was an<br />\nexcellent playmaker all year<br />\nlong.\"<br />\nOnce again, the No-Goal Patrol<br />\ndid an excellent job. Andy<br />\nNicholas and Eric Lindenbaum<br />\ncompletely shut down Washington's top scorer, Mike Bishop.<br />\nIn a previous meeting with<br />\nthe Shoremen, Bishop hurt Hopkins by controlling the ball in the<br />\nair and creating scoring threats<br />\nwith his passing and ball control.<br />\nThis time, however, he was completely shut down.<br />\nOn Sunday, the Jays faced<br />\nFrostburg State, who had earned<br />\ntheir place in the championship<br />\ngame by defeating Salibury State<br />\n2-1. Hopkins won easily 7-1,<br />\nfinishing the season with eight<br />\nconsecutive wins and a 12-4-1<br />\nrecord.<br />\nCraig Weinstein continued his<br />\nhot scoring by booting home a rebound off a Grenville Jones shot.<br />\nWarren Jones got his third goal<br />\nof the season in the second half<br />\nby heading in a cross from<br />\nWeinstein. Frostburg then made<br /><br />\nthe score 2-1, as they followed up<br />\nwith a beautiful save by Hopkins<br />\ngoalie Chris Vanderkeift by kicking in the loose ball in front.<br />\nJoe DalPorto scored the next<br />\ntwo goals for Hopkins, giving<br />\nhim five goals for the season. The<br />\nfirst was assisted by McKiernan<br />\non a cross, and the second came<br />\non a rebound of a missed shot.<br />\nTodd Marshall made a super effort in scoring the team's final<br />\ngoal of the season off an assist<br />\nfrom Greg Bronshvag. Defensively, mid-fielders Warren<br />\nJones, Dan Sisbarro, Joe DalPorto, Jim McKiernan, and Andy<br />\nNicholas kept Frostburg out of<br />\nthe Hopkins zone.<br />\nIn their four years at Hopkins,<br />\nthe seniors on the soccer team<br />\nestablished a tradition of winning<br />\nhere at Homewood. They racked<br />\nup two Southeast MAC titles, one<br />\nMAC Southern title, a quarterfinal appearance in the NCAA<br />\nDivision III Tournament, and two<br />\nMaryland State Small College<br />\nChampionships in their four year<br />\ntenure. Hopkins record over the<br />\nlast four years was 53-15-3, and<br />\nthey lost only two games at home<br />\nduring that stretch. Together,<br />\nthey have made the Hopkins Soccer program one of the most<br />\nrespected in Division 111.<br /><br />\n\"I said earlier in the year that<br />\nour eight seniors would have to<br />\nbe leaders in order for us to enjoy any success this year,\" said<br />\nHaus. \"They did just that. They<br />\nall enjoyed a very successful four<br />\nyears at Hopkins and capturing<br />\nthe state title was a nice finish for<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nThe graduating seniors are:<br />\nBob Angevine, Jeff Caddell, Joe<br />\nDalPorto, Grenvill Jones, Matt<br />\nLawrence, Eric Lindenbaum, Jim<br />\nMcKiernan, Andy Nicholas, and<br />\nCraig Weinstein.<br />\nCoach John Haus and Assistant<br />\nCoach Dan Olszewski have compiled a 26-7-2 record over the last<br />\ntwo seasons, and they have yet to<br />\nlose on the turf.
