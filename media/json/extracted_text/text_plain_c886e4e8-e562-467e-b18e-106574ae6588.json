And if our observer is so bold as to peek<br />\nthrough the small, square, wirereinforced plate-glass window in<br />\nthe door, he will find that this<br />\nincubus of creaks, gratings,<br />\nwhirrs, twangs, jangles, buzzes,<br />\nand tintinnabulation is emerging cacophoniously from<br />\na<br />\nfrightening array of metallic<br />\nmonsters, many of which vaingloriously display the brand of<br />\n\"IBM.\" Undoubtedly he is led<br />\nto conjecture that their function<br />\nis related in some insidious manner to the multi-colored variety<br />\nof 5/8\" tape which is arrayed in<br />\nvarious lengths at different posi-<br />\n<br />\ntions in the room and which is<br />\nseen passing through certain of<br />\nthe larger and more obstreperous<br />\nmachines.

Also, we felt time<br />\nwas a very important factor<br />\nhere.

Many<br />\ndorm representatives are conscientious, and many are doing<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\na good job.

Also, we felt time<br />\nwas a very important factor<br />\nhere. We wanted to form a Committee to find out exactly what<br />\nthis was all about, and we<br />\nwanted them to start right away.<br />\n(At this writing, one conference<br />\nhas already taken place between<br />\nthe Committee and the Deans,<br />\nand we hope to get a full report on this at the next DSRC<br />\nmeeting.)

The<br />\nWisdom of admitting the principle that each \"peacetime\" serviceman of two years should have<br />\na claim on the government for<br />\neducational aid can certainly be<br />\ndebated; nevertheless the government has already taken the<br />\nPlunge itself by extending the<br />\nbenefits to all those in service<br />\n1.113 to the arbitrary cut-off date<br />\nof January 31, 1955. (This is not<br />\nOf course to be oblivious to the<br />\nfact that any cut-off date later<br />\nthan the actual date of the last<br />\nShot fired in anger would entail<br />\ninjustices to those unfortunate<br />\nenough to be a day late.) Hence<br />\nit does not seem unreasonable<br />\nto extend the benefits retroactive137 to all those qualified men<br />\n(and women) who have been in<br />\nservice since January 31, 1955,<br />\nas well as to those who will be<br />\nso in the future.<br />\nClearly then we are suggesting<br />\nonly one approach to the problem of<br />\nstrengthening higher<br />\neducation. As the complex interrelations between . the federal<br />\ng.overnment and higher education that<br />\nalready exist become<br />\ninore intimate each year, it<br />\nseems reasonable to propose that<br />\na Program which has proven itSelf and whose administrative<br />\nMachinery is still in existence be<br />\ncontinued. Doubtless, Congress<br />\nWill initiate other forms of aid,<br />\nas well as continue and expand<br />\nthose already in existence, e.g..<br />\nthe National Defense Education<br />\nAct, College Housing Loan Program, etc. On the issue of scholarships, and especially qualified<br />\nstudents at the very low income<br />\nlevels, the American Council<br />\nconcludes that \"scholarships and<br />\nloans<br />\noffered by the institutions<br />\nt<br />\nhemselves and by other agencies<br />\nhave not kept pace, and the<br />\nParticipation of the Federal Government has been declining as<br />\neducational benefits under the<br />\nWorld War II and the Korean<br />\nGI Bills draw to an end.\" We<br />\nee no compelling reason why<br />\nthe GI Bill should end.
