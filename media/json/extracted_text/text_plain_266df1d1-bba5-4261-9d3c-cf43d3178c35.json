The National Council<br />\nalso dealt with \u2022the issues of<br />\nWomen's Liberation, Inauguration<br />\nDay demonstrations and the<br />\nTenth Anniversary of the Cuban<br />\nRevolution.<br />\nFor the last year, SDS has<br />\nbeen discussing and debating the<br />\ntraditional blue-collar working<br />\nclass: its importance in modern<br />\ncapitalism, its role in a movement<br />\nfor revolutionary change, and<br />\nhow best to link up with and<br />\norganize the \"working class\" for<br />\nsuch change. SDS has slowly<br />\ncome to the belief that the<br />\nworking class is a critical force in<br />\nthis society, that it should play a<br />\nleading role in the movement for<br />\nrevolutionary change, and that it<br />\nis of crucial importance at this<br />\ntime that the Movement makes,<br />\nserious alliances with the working<br />\nclass, especially its progressive<br />\nelements. Radicals emphasize this<br />\nby pointing to the important<br />\neffects of the worker-student<br />\nalliance during the French May<br />\nRebellion.<br />\n<br />\norganize in the Army,in the High<br />\nSchools, Working Class Colleges,<br />\ntrade and technical schools, in the<br />\nstreets, around these group<br />\nsimilarities and common forms of<br />\noppression which give the lie to<br />\nthe myth of the American Dream<br />\nand the American Consensus. The<br />\nformulators do not see youth as a<br />\nformal class, and while<br />\nmaintaining that young and old<br />\nworkers have more in common<br />\nthan the young of different<br />\nclasses, they see this proposal for<br />\na \"Revolutionary Youth<br />\nMovement\" as a means of making<br />\nconnections with the working<br />\nclass. It is seen as a temporary<br />\nstrategy for broadening the base<br />\nof the Movement to include the<br />\nworking class on a significant<br />\nscale which will lead to a<br />\nmovement for revolutionary<br />\nchange dominated by the working<br />\nclass.<br />\nThe National Council also<br />\npassed a resolution aimed at<br />\npromoting the struggle for<br />\nWomen's Liberation. SDS sees<br />\nthat women, like black people<br />\nand young people, experience<br />\ncertain forms of oppression<br />\ncommon to the group. The<br />\nprimary forms of oppression are<br />\neconomic: women are<br />\ndiscriminated against in job hiring<br />\nand promotion, women are paid<br />\nlower wages than men, women<br />\nserve as a reserve labor force to<br />\nreplace men during wartime and<br />\nduring strikes. Secondarily,<br />\nwomen take a back-seat role to<br />\nmen socially and politically. The<br />\nideas of the prim and proper<br />\nwoman who \"knows her place\",<br />\nwhich is inculcated starting at the<br />\nyoungest age possible, is still the<br />\nideal in this society despite<br />\ncertain progressive or \"hip\"<br />\nexamples to the contrary. Women<br />\nare exploited sexually, both<br />\ncommercially and by men<br />\nindividually, i.e., not only the<br />\n\"double standard\" but also the<br />\nnotion of the girl-friend or wife as<br />\na possession. Women,<br />\nfurthermore, internalize out of<br />\nnecessity this value system and<br />\nthese relationships. The<br />\noppression of women as an<br />\neconomic \"class\", by men in<br />\nsocial relationships and by<br />\nthemselves through the process of<br />\ninternalization occurs even within<br />\nthe \"Movement.' The women's<br />\n<br />\nLabor Committees which lend<br />\nsupport (often critical) to labor<br />\nstrikes and in turn try to gain<br />\nlabor support for student<br />\ndemands and actions. This<br />\napproach has met with varied<br />\ndegrees of success, especially<br />\nduring the massive strike now<br />\ngoing on at San Francisco State<br />\nCollege.<br />\nMany in SDS feel, however,<br />\nthat this approach is too<br />\nmechanistic, either too<br />\nunsuccessful or too politically<br />\ncompromising, and too unnatural.<br />\nWhat they do see is young people<br />\nof all classes faced with certain<br />\ncommon forms of oppression and<br />\nalienation. Youth face the draft,<br />\nyouth are forced through an<br />\nauthoritarian and alienating<br />\neducational system, youth are the<br />\nobjects of the most massive sales<br />\ncampaign ever mounted in the<br />\nhistory of American<br />\ncapitalism...most of which is junk,<br />\nyouth are denied due process and<br />\nequal protection in the courts,<br />\nyouth are continually messed over<br />\nby the cops, youth are required to<br />\ndo meaningless work, be it in the<br />\nschools or the work place. It is<br />\nalso significant that young people<br />\nhave the greatest rate of<br />\nunemployment and the most job<br />\ninsecurity, that young blacks are<br />\nin the forefront of the black<br />\nliberation struggle, young middle<br />\nclass people in the forefront of<br />\nthe \"white\" movement, and<br />\nyoung workers in the forefront of<br />\nthe labor insurgencies. Young<br />\npeople as a group are turned off<br />\nby Mainstream America, and<br />\nturned on to other things.<br />\n<br />\nThe question which is now<br />\nfacing SDS is how to make this ,<br />\nlink-up, given the conservative<br />\nnature of the labor movement in ,<br />\nthis country and of the working<br />\nclass in general. Although there is<br />\na great deal of rank-and-file<br />\ninsurgency within labor unions<br />\nwhich goes virtually unreported in,<br />\nthe media, there is a wide gulfl<br />\nA resolution was presented<br />\nbetween the middle-class student<br />\nand<br />\npassed<br />\nat the SDS National<br />\nmovement and working people, of,<br />\nwhich politics is but one example.

(Naturally, there was no previous letter of<br />\ntwo weeks ago). Tell your board that you are awaiting their answer<br />\nand are surprised that they have not yet replied. The board's staff is<br />\nthen obligated to search through their files for your letter, causing<br />\nuniversal grief.<br />\n2 - Write a letter to your board, using a fictitious name,<br />\nwondering why you have not received your first classification card.<br />\nGiven a false return address. (If you have time write a dozen or so<br />\nletters to this effect). According to our information, when the board<br />\nfails to find records of the non-person, and fails to contact him<br />\nabout the non-existence of his records, they will have to send<br />\nsomeone to investigate. The best method to use here, is to take a few<br />\nnames from your local phone book who have addresses withint the<br />\njurisdiction of your board.<br />\n3 - As a public-spirited citizen, alert your draft board to the<br />\nfact that you have heard of plans to raid their office and pour blood<br />\nin the 1-A files. This method is best used if you know of someone<br />\n(preferably someone you don't like) who plans to visit his draft<br />\nboard on a specific day on some business. Give a good description of<br />\nhim. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.<br />\n4 - Keep a diary of all the minute things that happen to you in<br />\nday-to-day life. Make a carbon for your own personal use, and send<br />\nthe original closely-hand written 3 pages each day to your board,<br />\npreferably addressed to a specific ranking board member. At some<br />\npoint in one of your daily missives, insert a question pertinent to<br />\nyour draft status. If the question goes unanswered, write to your<br />\nboard a few weeks later asking what their reply was to the question<br />\nposed in \"my letter of the fifteenty... or sixteenth.., or<br />\nseventeenth.\"<br />\n5 - Send them a copy of this editorial,(we don't want to go<br />\neither).<br />\n<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThe Presidential inaugural<br />\nceremonies, soon to be renewed,<br />\nhave had an interesting evolution.<br />\nInaugurals have been held<br />\nindoors, have been held in three<br />\ndifferent cities and have had<br />\nvarying historical significance.<br />\nThe Constitution provides<br />\nonly that the President must take<br />\nan oath, which is all that is done<br />\nin cases of non-quadrennial<br />\nsuccession. However, George ,<br />\nWashington was understandably<br />\nhonored in several communities<br />\nwhen he went north to New York<br />\nfor the first inaugural in 1789.<br />\nThis first ceremony was held<br />\noutdoors, and Mr. Washington<br />\ndelivered a long inaugural address.<br />\nHowever, he had neglected to<br />\nbring his Bible with him and had<br />\nto acquire one in New York. That<br />\nthe President will hold a Bible in<br />\ntaking the required oath is as<br />\ncertain as that he will attend the<br />\nceremonies.<br />\nFor Mr. Washington's<br />\nsecond inaugural, there seemed no<br />\nreason to have more than the<br />\noath taking. Thomas Jefferson was<br />\nan especially earnest advocate of<br />\nsimplicity, and there was a very<br />\nbrief ceremony within the .Senate<br />\nchamber in Philadelphia. Mr.<br />\nWashington delivered a statement<br />\nof thanks, which may be<br />\nconsidered the shortest inaugural<br />\naddress, but which was so brief as<br />\nto make it a tenable proposition<br />\nthat there was no inaugural<br />\naddress in 1793.<br />\nOutdoors<br />\nJohn Adams was<br />\ninaugurated March 4, 1797 in the<br />\nHouse chamber in Philadelphia,<br />\nand since then all inaugurals have<br />\nbeen in Washington, D.C. Mr.<br />\nJefferson's own inaugurals were<br />\nnot as simple as that which he had<br />\nprescribed for Mr. Washington.<br />\nInaugurals alternated between the<br />\n<br />\nchambers of the Senate and the<br />\nHouse until 1817, when there<br />\nwasa dispute between the two<br />\nHouses over the allocation of<br />\ntickets. James Monroe therefore<br />\nparticipated in the second<br />\noutdoor inauguration.<br />\nThe ceremonies reverted to<br />\nthe indoors until Andrew<br />\nJackson, who desired a<br />\ngovernment close to the people,<br />\nwas inaugurated outdoors in<br />\n18_29. Afterwards his supporters<br />\nentered the White House, and<br />\ncommitted some property<br />\ndamage, so that in the famous<br />\nwords of Supreme Court Justice<br />\nJoseph Story of Massachusetts,<br />\n\"the reign of King Mob seemed<br />\ntriumphant.\"<br />\nFew inaugurations have<br />\nbeen equally open to<br />\nparticipation. Even then, and<br />\nagain in the inauguration of<br />\nZachary Taylor in 1849, there<br />\nwere complaints of insufficient<br />\nrefreshments. But no President<br />\nsince has been inaugurated<br />\nindoors, despite such incidents as<br />\nthe rain at James K. Polk's<br />\ninauguration in 1845.<br />\nNo Notes<br />\nOnly one president,<br />\nFranklin Pierce in 1853, delivered<br />\nhis inaugural address without<br />\nreading from notes. Mr. Pierce<br />\nhad been among the leading trial<br />\nlawyers of New Hampshire, and<br />\nhis oratorical powers were quite<br />\nequal to this occasion.<br />\nThere is 'no lack of<br />\ncommentary on one of the<br />\nmilestones of our history, the<br />\ninauguration of Abraham Lincoln<br />\non March 4, 1861. To me it is<br />\nmost arresting that, besides Mr.<br />\nLincoln, so many of those who<br />\nplayed an important role in the<br />\nceremony would not live to see<br />\nanother President. Mr. Lincoln<br />\nwas introduced by a former<br />\ncolleague in the Winois State<br />\nLegislature, Senator Edward D.<br />\nBaker of Oregon, who died that<br />\n<br />\nautumn at the Battle of Ball's<br />\nBluff. During the inaugural<br />\naddress Mr. Lincoln's hat was held<br />\nby his former adversary, Senator<br />\nStephen A. Douglas, who also had<br />\nonly months to live. Then the<br />\noath was administered to Mr.<br />\nLincoln by Chief Justice Roger B.<br />\nTaney, who had been criticized<br />\nby the former for his decision in<br />\nthe Dred Scott case, and who was<br />\nto die on Columbus Day of 1864.<br />\nBig-Mouth Coolidge<br />\nThe twentieth century has<br />\nseen two important changes, the<br />\nintroduction of broadcasting and<br />\nthe changing of the date from<br />\nMarch 4 to January 20. Radio<br />\nfirst covered the ceremonies on<br />\nMarch 4, 1925, at the<br />\ninauguration of Calvin Coolidge.<br />\nThe oath of office was<br />\nadministered by Chief Justice<br />\nWilliam Howard Taft, himself<br />\ninaugurated on the same day<br />\nsixteen years before, who noted<br />\nthat his voice was heard and<br />\nrecognized in all parts of the<br />\ncountry. The first televised<br />\ncoverage of the inauguration of<br />\nHarry S. Truman on January 20,<br />\n1949.<br />\nThe first President<br />\ninaugurated on January 20,<br />\nfollowing the enactment of<br />\nGeorge Norris' Twentieth<br />\nAmendment, was Franklin D.<br />\nRoosevelt for his second term in<br />\n1937. Had this been the operative<br />\ndate earlier, John Adams would<br />\nhave been inhibited from<br />\nappointing John Marshall as Chief<br />\nJustice.<br />\nThe inaugural ceremony is<br />\nsignificant as a symbol of unity.<br />\nThe administering of the oath of<br />\noffice by the head of the judicial<br />\nbranch to the head of the<br />\nexecutive branch in front of the<br />\nlegislative chamber illustrates the<br />\nfundamental cohesiveness of the<br />\nFederal government.<br />\n<br />\nVietnam as a Pastime 1<br />\n<br />\nand Vietnam.

When it comes to<br />\nBeatlerablia, I'm an insatiable<br />\nhog. I scour all the magazines,<br />\nnewspapers, and rock journals,<br />\nmy heart throbbing with a 13<br />\nyear old's excitement, searching<br />\nfor the merest mention of my<br />\nheroes' names.

Although it<br />\nis less intellectually satisfying<br />\nthan Sgt.

Part of the<br />\nreason for this disappointment are<br />\n. the disclaimers of the Beatles<br />\nthemselves, who say that a lot of<br />\ntheir songs are put-ons, rubbish,<br />\nnonsensical,. and meaningless. In<br />\nthe good old days, one could<br />\nspend many fruitful hours poring<br />\nover the songs of the Beatles,<br />\nfinding literary allusions and<br />\nhidden meanings to satisfy the<br />\nheart of any literary scholar.<br />\nNow, of course, we find we can't<br />\nfind great meaning in obscure<br />\nsongs like \"I Am the Walrus\"<br />\nbecause John Lennon won't let<br />\nus.<br />\nWhat the Beatles are doing,<br />\nand everybody else it seems, is<br />\nreturning to their roots, their<br />\npast. This past was a simpler one,<br />\nwith easy lyrics and a simple turn.<br />\nSongs like \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie,\"<br />\n\"Love Me Do,\" and \"P.S.

Staged .and<br />\nchoreographed by master of ceremonies, Henry Ciccarone, the three<br />\n119ur extravaganza clearly rivaled the Academy Awards in trophies if<br />\nnot in comic talent. Ciccarone filtered out all the funny lines and<br />\nconcentrated on the business of the evening. \"...going to scout<br />\nCarnegie Mellon, Mr. Smith got me tickets on a small Italian airline.\"<br />\nThe first order of business was digestion.

Hardly getting a change to enjoy a<br />\nBarrette monologue, Miller and Tobey, were up again capturing<br />\nplaces on the MI-South team. In the trophy department, Dave<br />\nRoberts, leading scorer, and Randy Miller, outstanding player, took<br />\nthe honors. An engraved soccer ball was given by Mr. Barrette to<br />\ncaptain Mike Avery for outstanding sportsmanship: The Booster<br />\nClub awarded a mini-trophy to \"unsung hero\" Greg Sarau. Avery, on<br />\nbehalf of the team, thanked trainers Leroy Brandimore and Steve<br />\nBartlett and trundled over to Coach Barrette with a varsity \"H Club\"<br />\njacket. In the '68 soccer swansong Avery announced that Randy<br />\nMiller and Dave Roberts were elected co-captains for '69.<br />\nSOTIR'S SORTIE<br />\nOnce upon a while the Jay gridmen were 0-6-2. Two years<br />\nhave gone by and in that period the varisty eleven have taken two<br />\nconsectuvie MAC championships. The man to blame for this<br />\nachievement, head coach Alex Sotir, spelled out the ingredients in<br />\nhis championship brew. Take a dash of administrative empathy, a<br />\ntouch of studen enthusiasm and dump in lots of team pride and<br />\nbingo - a championship.<br />\nNevertheless, the trophies went to the bodies who blocked,<br />\n'bruised and busted themselves to the championship. Co-captains<br />\nDon Yablonowitz and Willie Scroggs received game balls from<br />\nCarnegie-Mellon and Western Maryland respectively. The unsung<br />\nBoosters picked unsung heroes John Peck and Willie Scroggs for<br />\nawards. Don took home a silver cup in memory of Hopkins'<br />\ntOotballer Charles E. Aronhalt, who was killed in Vietnam in 1966:<br />\nFor variety a plaque was given to Joe Cowen for team spirit. The<br />\nnewly founded Huddle Club gave its second annual contribution<br />\ntrophy to Phil Schrodel. This trophy was a high rise jqb and was the<br />\ngaudiest of the festivities. Representing the MAC, Marshall Turner<br />\nmade the championship official. Mr. Bilgrave proved to be as<br />\nefficient a tie clip distributor as he is an administrator, calling off the<br />\nroster in 3 minutes and 6 seconds. Don, like his soccer counterpart,<br />\ngave the coaches jackets. Due to close balloting, the '69 team will<br />\nhave tri-captains. They are Jim Lotto, Charlie Coker and Dan<br />\nRosenfeld.

And it is a<br />\ntribute to both coach and<br />\nswimmers that Hopkins can even<br />\nthink of challenging Delaware.<br />\nScouting reports indicate that the<br />\ncontest will be extremely tight.<br />\nThe Jays hope to have the meet<br />\nwon before the final event, the<br />\nfreestyle, where Delaware now<br />\nhas an edge, and while all races<br />\nare crucial, the 50 and 100 yd.<br />\nfreestyle and the 200 yd.<br />\nindividual medley loon as key<br />\ncontests.<br />\nDrawing Comfort<br />\nIn any case, as the Jan. 15<br />\ndeadline draws closer, certain<br />\nelements may work in the Jays<br />\nfavor and could spell the<br />\ndifference between victory or<br />\ndefeat. First is the home pool<br />\nadvantage. While this is a minor,<br />\nconsideration because of the<br />\nexcellent facilities, a partisan<br />\ncrowd can only help Hopkins. In<br />\naddition, the bus ride and a night<br />\n<br />\nmeet might find Delaware a bit<br />\ntired.<br />\nSecond is Delaware's<br />\nrigorous dual meet schedule<br />\nwhich has them swimming five<br />\nmeets before meeting Hopkins,<br />\nand possibly the swimmers could<br />\nbe psychologically tired. Third is<br />\nthe psyche factor. Coach Comfort<br />\nhas injected a determination into<br />\nthe Jays previously unknown. As<br />\nthe Bullets' slogan goes: \"We have<br />\na few scores to settle.\"<br />\nIntangible Difference<br />\nIndeed, the squad is<br />\npointing for this contest, and<br />\nalthough Delaware must be aware<br />\nof the Jays' improvement,<br />\nhopefully they will not be taking<br />\nthe meet as seriously as Comfort's<br />\ncharges. This intangible could<br />\nmake all the difference. The meet<br />\nis scheduled for 8:30 p.m. on<br />\nWed., Jan. 15, at Homewood<br />\npool.<br />\nTomorrow, the Jays tangle<br />\nwith PMC at Homewood at 3:00<br />\np.m. Last year Hopkins nipped<br />\nthe Cadets 47-46. This year's<br />\nmeet could be as close but it is<br />\nunlikely. Mr. Comfort is viewing<br />\nthe meet as a final tune-up for<br />\nDelaware and is not cutting down<br />\non practices. The attitude around<br />\nthe locker room is one of<br />\nconfidence. However, PMC has an<br />\noutstanding freestyle sprinter and<br />\ntwo fine backstrokers. Heavily<br />\nladen with sophomores the Cadets<br />\nare basically an unknown<br />\nquantity in MAC circles and could<br />\nspell trouble for a complacent<br />\nHopkins crew.<br />\nIn the two meets before<br />\nChristmas break, Hopkins easily<br />\nbeat Swarthmore 53-40 and then<br />\nswamped Towson State 65-28.<br />\nHighlighting the Towson meet<br />\nwere Marc Solomon who qualified<br />\nfor the NCAA college nationals in<br />\nthe 200 yd. butterfly, Mike<br />\nO'Donnell who set a varsity<br />\nrecord in the 200 yd.<br />\nbreaststroke, and Brian Turner's<br />\n100 yd. freestyle record (52.5).<br />\n<br />\nFreshmen Five Down<br />\nGilman in Easy Victory<br />\nBy MIKE SHORE<br />\nThe frosh basketball team,<br />\nunder the direction of Coach<br />\nGary Barrette, had a busy week<br />\nbefore the holiday break, winning<br />\n2 games against 1 loss, and<br />\nshowing off some high quality<br />\nTo open their season, the<br />\nteam met Gilman High School,<br />\nand coasted to an easy 65-53<br />\nvictory.

The National Council<br />\nalso dealt with \u2022the issues of<br />\nWomen's Liberation, Inauguration<br />\nDay demonstrations and the<br />\nTenth Anniversary of the Cuban<br />\nRevolution.<br />\nFor the last year, SDS has<br />\nbeen discussing and debating the<br />\ntraditional blue-collar working<br />\nclass: its importance in modern<br />\ncapitalism, its role in a movement<br />\nfor revolutionary change, and<br />\nhow best to link up with and<br />\norganize the \"working class\" for<br />\nsuch change. SDS has slowly<br />\ncome to the belief that the<br />\nworking class is a critical force in<br />\nthis society, that it should play a<br />\nleading role in the movement for<br />\nrevolutionary change, and that it<br />\nis of crucial importance at this<br />\ntime that the Movement makes,<br />\nserious alliances with the working<br />\nclass, especially its progressive<br />\nelements. Radicals emphasize this<br />\nby pointing to the important<br />\neffects of the worker-student<br />\nalliance during the French May<br />\nRebellion.<br /><br />\norganize in the Army,in the High<br />\nSchools, Working Class Colleges,<br />\ntrade and technical schools, in the<br />\nstreets, around these group<br />\nsimilarities and common forms of<br />\noppression which give the lie to<br />\nthe myth of the American Dream<br />\nand the American Consensus. The<br />\nformulators do not see youth as a<br />\nformal class, and while<br />\nmaintaining that young and old<br />\nworkers have more in common<br />\nthan the young of different<br />\nclasses, they see this proposal for<br />\na \"Revolutionary Youth<br />\nMovement\" as a means of making<br />\nconnections with the working<br />\nclass. It is seen as a temporary<br />\nstrategy for broadening the base<br />\nof the Movement to include the<br />\nworking class on a significant<br />\nscale which will lead to a<br />\nmovement for revolutionary<br />\nchange dominated by the working<br />\nclass.<br />\nThe National Council also<br />\npassed a resolution aimed at<br />\npromoting the struggle for<br />\nWomen's Liberation. SDS sees<br />\nthat women, like black people<br />\nand young people, experience<br />\ncertain forms of oppression<br />\ncommon to the group. The<br />\nprimary forms of oppression are<br />\neconomic: women are<br />\ndiscriminated against in job hiring<br />\nand promotion, women are paid<br />\nlower wages than men, women<br />\nserve as a reserve labor force to<br />\nreplace men during wartime and<br />\nduring strikes. Secondarily,<br />\nwomen take a back-seat role to<br />\nmen socially and politically. The<br />\nideas of the prim and proper<br />\nwoman who \"knows her place\",<br />\nwhich is inculcated starting at the<br />\nyoungest age possible, is still the<br />\nideal in this society despite<br />\ncertain progressive or \"hip\"<br />\nexamples to the contrary. Women<br />\nare exploited sexually, both<br />\ncommercially and by men<br />\nindividually, i.e., not only the<br />\n\"double standard\" but also the<br />\nnotion of the girl-friend or wife as<br />\na possession. Women,<br />\nfurthermore, internalize out of<br />\nnecessity this value system and<br />\nthese relationships. The<br />\noppression of women as an<br />\neconomic \"class\", by men in<br />\nsocial relationships and by<br />\nthemselves through the process of<br />\ninternalization occurs even within<br />\nthe \"Movement.' The women's<br /><br />\nLabor Committees which lend<br />\nsupport (often critical) to labor<br />\nstrikes and in turn try to gain<br />\nlabor support for student<br />\ndemands and actions. This<br />\napproach has met with varied<br />\ndegrees of success, especially<br />\nduring the massive strike now<br />\ngoing on at San Francisco State<br />\nCollege.<br />\nMany in SDS feel, however,<br />\nthat this approach is too<br />\nmechanistic, either too<br />\nunsuccessful or too politically<br />\ncompromising, and too unnatural.<br />\nWhat they do see is young people<br />\nof all classes faced with certain<br />\ncommon forms of oppression and<br />\nalienation. Youth face the draft,<br />\nyouth are forced through an<br />\nauthoritarian and alienating<br />\neducational system, youth are the<br />\nobjects of the most massive sales<br />\ncampaign ever mounted in the<br />\nhistory of American<br />\ncapitalism...most of which is junk,<br />\nyouth are denied due process and<br />\nequal protection in the courts,<br />\nyouth are continually messed over<br />\nby the cops, youth are required to<br />\ndo meaningless work, be it in the<br />\nschools or the work place. It is<br />\nalso significant that young people<br />\nhave the greatest rate of<br />\nunemployment and the most job<br />\ninsecurity, that young blacks are<br />\nin the forefront of the black<br />\nliberation struggle, young middle<br />\nclass people in the forefront of<br />\nthe \"white\" movement, and<br />\nyoung workers in the forefront of<br />\nthe labor insurgencies. Young<br />\npeople as a group are turned off<br />\nby Mainstream America, and<br />\nturned on to other things.<br /><br />\nThe question which is now<br />\nfacing SDS is how to make this ,<br />\nlink-up, given the conservative<br />\nnature of the labor movement in ,<br />\nthis country and of the working<br />\nclass in general.

Many wished to<br />\ncompletely disassociate<br />\nthemselves from the National<br />\nMobilization Committee which is<br />\nsponsoring a counter-Inauguration<br />\nmarch on January 19. The<br />\n\"Mobe\" has increasingly fallen<br />\ninto disrepute with the members<br />\nof SDS as their political analysis<br />\nhas become more radical while<br />\nthat of the Mobe's has remained<br />\nfairly fixed in a single-issue<br />\n\"anti-war\" position.

Other<br />\npeople insisted that the<br /><br />\nInauguration was not that<br />\nsignificant politically to warrant a<br />\nmajor organizing effort for a large<br />\ndemonstration, and that the<br />\norganization should be more<br />\nselective in choosing<br />\nopportunities to express its<br />\npolitics.<br />\nThe National Council also<br />\ncalled for the withdrawal of the<br />\nNational Guard from Wilmington.<br />\nDelaware, which has been under<br />\noccupation since the rebellions<br />\nthere touched off by the<br />\nassassination of Martin Luther<br />\nKing.

The<br />\nprimary target of this repression<br />\nhas been the Wilmington Youth<br />\nEmergency Council, which is<br />\nfunded by 0E0.

(Naturally, there was no previous letter of<br />\ntwo weeks ago). Tell your board that you are awaiting their answer<br />\nand are surprised that they have not yet replied. The board's staff is<br />\nthen obligated to search through their files for your letter, causing<br />\nuniversal grief.<br />\n2 - Write a letter to your board, using a fictitious name,<br />\nwondering why you have not received your first classification card.<br />\nGiven a false return address. (If you have time write a dozen or so<br />\nletters to this effect). According to our information, when the board<br />\nfails to find records of the non-person, and fails to contact him<br />\nabout the non-existence of his records, they will have to send<br />\nsomeone to investigate. The best method to use here, is to take a few<br />\nnames from your local phone book who have addresses withint the<br />\njurisdiction of your board.<br />\n3 - As a public-spirited citizen, alert your draft board to the<br />\nfact that you have heard of plans to raid their office and pour blood<br />\nin the 1-A files. This method is best used if you know of someone<br />\n(preferably someone you don't like) who plans to visit his draft<br />\nboard on a specific day on some business. Give a good description of<br />\nhim. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.<br />\n4 - Keep a diary of all the minute things that happen to you in<br />\nday-to-day life. Make a carbon for your own personal use, and send<br />\nthe original closely-hand written 3 pages each day to your board,<br />\npreferably addressed to a specific ranking board member. At some<br />\npoint in one of your daily missives, insert a question pertinent to<br />\nyour draft status. If the question goes unanswered, write to your<br />\nboard a few weeks later asking what their reply was to the question<br />\nposed in \"my letter of the fifteenty... or sixteenth.., or<br />\nseventeenth.\"<br />\n5 - Send them a copy of this editorial,(we don't want to go<br />\neither).<br /><br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThe Presidential inaugural<br />\nceremonies, soon to be renewed,<br />\nhave had an interesting evolution.<br />\nInaugurals have been held<br />\nindoors, have been held in three<br />\ndifferent cities and have had<br />\nvarying historical significance.<br />\nThe Constitution provides<br />\nonly that the President must take<br />\nan oath, which is all that is done<br />\nin cases of non-quadrennial<br />\nsuccession. However, George ,<br />\nWashington was understandably<br />\nhonored in several communities<br />\nwhen he went north to New York<br />\nfor the first inaugural in 1789.<br />\nThis first ceremony was held<br />\noutdoors, and Mr. Washington<br />\ndelivered a long inaugural address.<br />\nHowever, he had neglected to<br />\nbring his Bible with him and had<br />\nto acquire one in New York. That<br />\nthe President will hold a Bible in<br />\ntaking the required oath is as<br />\ncertain as that he will attend the<br />\nceremonies.<br />\nFor Mr. Washington's<br />\nsecond inaugural, there seemed no<br />\nreason to have more than the<br />\noath taking. Thomas Jefferson was<br />\nan especially earnest advocate of<br />\nsimplicity, and there was a very<br />\nbrief ceremony within the .Senate<br />\nchamber in Philadelphia. Mr.<br />\nWashington delivered a statement<br />\nof thanks, which may be<br />\nconsidered the shortest inaugural<br />\naddress, but which was so brief as<br />\nto make it a tenable proposition<br />\nthat there was no inaugural<br />\naddress in 1793.<br />\nOutdoors<br />\nJohn Adams was<br />\ninaugurated March 4, 1797 in the<br />\nHouse chamber in Philadelphia,<br />\nand since then all inaugurals have<br />\nbeen in Washington, D.C. Mr.<br />\nJefferson's own inaugurals were<br />\nnot as simple as that which he had<br />\nprescribed for Mr. Washington.<br />\nInaugurals alternated between the<br /><br />\nchambers of the Senate and the<br />\nHouse until 1817, when there<br />\nwasa dispute between the two<br />\nHouses over the allocation of<br />\ntickets. James Monroe therefore<br />\nparticipated in the second<br />\noutdoor inauguration.<br />\nThe ceremonies reverted to<br />\nthe indoors until Andrew<br />\nJackson, who desired a<br />\ngovernment close to the people,<br />\nwas inaugurated outdoors in<br />\n18_29. Afterwards his supporters<br />\nentered the White House, and<br />\ncommitted some property<br />\ndamage, so that in the famous<br />\nwords of Supreme Court Justice<br />\nJoseph Story of Massachusetts,<br />\n\"the reign of King Mob seemed<br />\ntriumphant.\"<br />\nFew inaugurations have<br />\nbeen equally open to<br />\nparticipation. Even then, and<br />\nagain in the inauguration of<br />\nZachary Taylor in 1849, there<br />\nwere complaints of insufficient<br />\nrefreshments. But no President<br />\nsince has been inaugurated<br />\nindoors, despite such incidents as<br />\nthe rain at James K. Polk's<br />\ninauguration in 1845.<br />\nNo Notes<br />\nOnly one president,<br />\nFranklin Pierce in 1853, delivered<br />\nhis inaugural address without<br />\nreading from notes. Mr. Pierce<br />\nhad been among the leading trial<br />\nlawyers of New Hampshire, and<br />\nhis oratorical powers were quite<br />\nequal to this occasion.<br />\nThere is 'no lack of<br />\ncommentary on one of the<br />\nmilestones of our history, the<br />\ninauguration of Abraham Lincoln<br />\non March 4, 1861. To me it is<br />\nmost arresting that, besides Mr.<br />\nLincoln, so many of those who<br />\nplayed an important role in the<br />\nceremony would not live to see<br />\nanother President. Mr. Lincoln<br />\nwas introduced by a former<br />\ncolleague in the Winois State<br />\nLegislature, Senator Edward D.<br />\nBaker of Oregon, who died that<br /><br />\nautumn at the Battle of Ball's<br />\nBluff. During the inaugural<br />\naddress Mr. Lincoln's hat was held<br />\nby his former adversary, Senator<br />\nStephen A. Douglas, who also had<br />\nonly months to live. Then the<br />\noath was administered to Mr.<br />\nLincoln by Chief Justice Roger B.<br />\nTaney, who had been criticized<br />\nby the former for his decision in<br />\nthe Dred Scott case, and who was<br />\nto die on Columbus Day of 1864.<br />\nBig-Mouth Coolidge<br />\nThe twentieth century has<br />\nseen two important changes, the<br />\nintroduction of broadcasting and<br />\nthe changing of the date from<br />\nMarch 4 to January 20. Radio<br />\nfirst covered the ceremonies on<br />\nMarch 4, 1925, at the<br />\ninauguration of Calvin Coolidge.<br />\nThe oath of office was<br />\nadministered by Chief Justice<br />\nWilliam Howard Taft, himself<br />\ninaugurated on the same day<br />\nsixteen years before, who noted<br />\nthat his voice was heard and<br />\nrecognized in all parts of the<br />\ncountry. The first televised<br />\ncoverage of the inauguration of<br />\nHarry S. Truman on January 20,<br />\n1949.<br />\nThe first President<br />\ninaugurated on January 20,<br />\nfollowing the enactment of<br />\nGeorge Norris' Twentieth<br />\nAmendment, was Franklin D.<br />\nRoosevelt for his second term in<br />\n1937. Had this been the operative<br />\ndate earlier, John Adams would<br />\nhave been inhibited from<br />\nappointing John Marshall as Chief<br />\nJustice.<br />\nThe inaugural ceremony is<br />\nsignificant as a symbol of unity.<br />\nThe administering of the oath of<br />\noffice by the head of the judicial<br />\nbranch to the head of the<br />\nexecutive branch in front of the<br />\nlegislative chamber illustrates the<br />\nfundamental cohesiveness of the<br />\nFederal government.<br /><br />\nVietnam as a Pastime 1<br /><br />\nand Vietnam.

Although it<br />\nis less intellectually satisfying<br />\nthan Sgt.

Part of the<br />\nreason for this disappointment are<br />\n. the disclaimers of the Beatles<br />\nthemselves, who say that a lot of<br />\ntheir songs are put-ons, rubbish,<br />\nnonsensical,. and meaningless. In<br />\nthe good old days, one could<br />\nspend many fruitful hours poring<br />\nover the songs of the Beatles,<br />\nfinding literary allusions and<br />\nhidden meanings to satisfy the<br />\nheart of any literary scholar.<br />\nNow, of course, we find we can't<br />\nfind great meaning in obscure<br />\nsongs like \"I Am the Walrus\"<br />\nbecause John Lennon won't let<br />\nus.<br />\nWhat the Beatles are doing,<br />\nand everybody else it seems, is<br />\nreturning to their roots, their<br />\npast.

Staged .and<br />\nchoreographed by master of ceremonies, Henry Ciccarone, the three<br />\n119ur extravaganza clearly rivaled the Academy Awards in trophies if<br />\nnot in comic talent. Ciccarone filtered out all the funny lines and<br />\nconcentrated on the business of the evening. \"...going to scout<br />\nCarnegie Mellon, Mr. Smith got me tickets on a small Italian airline.\"<br />\nThe first order of business was digestion. An almost gruesome<br />\ntask,- pertaining to some mysterious meat, wrapped in an oblong<br />\nshade around Thanksgiving' Day's stuffing, covered with brown<br />\nall-purpose gravy.

He looked as in -place at a<br />\nsports banquet as General Eckert.<br />\nBARRETTE'S BOYS<br />\nPrefacing the soccer awards, Coach Gary Barrette gave the<br />\nclassic line of the affair. \"I thought this was going to be a joint<br />\nbanquet and so far I've ended up eating a football.\" After that<br />\nunpalatable allusion, Barrette praised his soccermen who finished<br />\nthird out of 17 teams in the Middle Atlantic Conference.<br />\nRecognition was givento Jay AB-Stars Rick Tobey, Art Guerin and<br />\nMike Avery in the MAC; and to Tobey, Guerin, and Randy Miller in<br />\nthe Mason-Dixon Conference. Hardly getting a change to enjoy a<br />\nBarrette monologue, Miller and Tobey, were up again capturing<br />\nplaces on the MI-South team. In the trophy department, Dave<br />\nRoberts, leading scorer, and Randy Miller, outstanding player, took<br />\nthe honors. An engraved soccer ball was given by Mr. Barrette to<br />\ncaptain Mike Avery for outstanding sportsmanship: The Booster<br />\nClub awarded a mini-trophy to \"unsung hero\" Greg Sarau. Avery, on<br />\nbehalf of the team, thanked trainers Leroy Brandimore and Steve<br />\nBartlett and trundled over to Coach Barrette with a varsity \"H Club\"<br />\njacket. In the '68 soccer swansong Avery announced that Randy<br />\nMiller and Dave Roberts were elected co-captains for '69.<br />\nSOTIR'S SORTIE<br />\nOnce upon a while the Jay gridmen were 0-6-2. Two years<br />\nhave gone by and in that period the varisty eleven have taken two<br />\nconsectuvie MAC championships. The man to blame for this<br />\nachievement, head coach Alex Sotir, spelled out the ingredients in<br />\nhis championship brew. Take a dash of administrative empathy, a<br />\ntouch of studen enthusiasm and dump in lots of team pride and<br />\nbingo - a championship.<br />\nNevertheless, the trophies went to the bodies who blocked,<br />\n'bruised and busted themselves to the championship. Co-captains<br />\nDon Yablonowitz and Willie Scroggs received game balls from<br />\nCarnegie-Mellon and Western Maryland respectively. The unsung<br />\nBoosters picked unsung heroes John Peck and Willie Scroggs for<br />\nawards. Don took home a silver cup in memory of Hopkins'<br />\ntOotballer Charles E. Aronhalt, who was killed in Vietnam in 1966:<br />\nFor variety a plaque was given to Joe Cowen for team spirit. The<br />\nnewly founded Huddle Club gave its second annual contribution<br />\ntrophy to Phil Schrodel. This trophy was a high rise jqb and was the<br />\ngaudiest of the festivities. Representing the MAC, Marshall Turner<br />\nmade the championship official. Mr. Bilgrave proved to be as<br />\nefficient a tie clip distributor as he is an administrator, calling off the<br />\nroster in 3 minutes and 6 seconds. Don, like his soccer counterpart,<br />\ngave the coaches jackets. Due to close balloting, the '69 team will<br />\nhave tri-captains. They are Jim Lotto, Charlie Coker and Dan<br />\nRosenfeld.

First is the home pool<br />\nadvantage. While this is a minor,<br />\nconsideration because of the<br />\nexcellent facilities, a partisan<br />\ncrowd can only help Hopkins. In<br />\naddition, the bus ride and a night<br /><br />\nmeet might find Delaware a bit<br />\ntired.<br />\nSecond is Delaware's<br />\nrigorous dual meet schedule<br />\nwhich has them swimming five<br />\nmeets before meeting Hopkins,<br />\nand possibly the swimmers could<br />\nbe psychologically tired. Third is<br />\nthe psyche factor. Coach Comfort<br />\nhas injected a determination into<br />\nthe Jays previously unknown. As<br />\nthe Bullets' slogan goes: \"We have<br />\na few scores to settle.\"<br />\nIntangible Difference<br />\nIndeed, the squad is<br />\npointing for this contest, and<br />\nalthough Delaware must be aware<br />\nof the Jays' improvement,<br />\nhopefully they will not be taking<br />\nthe meet as seriously as Comfort's<br />\ncharges.

This year's<br />\nmeet could be as close but it is<br />\nunlikely. Mr. Comfort is viewing<br />\nthe meet as a final tune-up for<br />\nDelaware and is not cutting down<br />\non practices. The attitude around<br />\nthe locker room is one of<br />\nconfidence. However, PMC has an<br />\noutstanding freestyle sprinter and<br />\ntwo fine backstrokers.
