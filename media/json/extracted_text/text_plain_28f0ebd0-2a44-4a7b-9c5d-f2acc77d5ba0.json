He said that<br />\nhe wanted to provide opportunities for students to express<br />\nwhat was on their minds.<br />\nRichardson discussed the most<br />\npressing issue that he is faced<br />\nwith right now\u2014the auditing of<br />\nHopkins' government research<br />\ngrants. He said that he spends<br />\nmuch of his time in Annapolis or<br />\nWashington meeting with<br />\nlegislators to discuss the issue of<br />\nindirect costs in connection with<br />\nfederal grants.<br />\nRichardson appeared confident<br />\nthat the screens set up to catch unnecessary spending of federal<br />\ndollars had been effective.<br />\n\"Our basic system is very<br />\nsound,\" he said. \"Hopkins traditionally had taken a very conservative stance. We should know in<br />\na matter of months what the<br />\nauditors have found.\"<br />\nGoing on to cite Hopkins as the<br />\nnation's number one university<br />\nrecipient of research grants, he<br />\npointed to the benefits gained<br />\nfrom such a distinction. The<br />\nmoney is earned competitively<br />\nand speaks highly of our faculty,<br />\nhe said. In addition, the grants<br />\nbring the University into national<br />\n<br />\nfocus and provide students with<br />\nfacilities and resources not readily<br />\navailable at other undergraduate<br />\ninstitutions of comparable size.<br />\nRichardson then discussed the<br />\nimage that Hopkins presents to<br />\nprospective students and to the<br />\neducational community. The<br />\nperennial competition with Ivy<br />\nLeague schools was mentioned,<br />\nbut only in reference to Hopkins'<br />\nsuccess in withstanding it.<br />\nRichardson noted the admissions<br />\nstatistics to illustrate Hopkins'<br />\ngrowing popularity and reputation as a prestigious university.<br />\nApplications for admission were<br />\nup 17% and the number of National Merit Semifinalists<br />\ndesignating Hopkins as their first<br />\nchoice also rose markedly.<br />\nThe President made note of the<br />\nfact that Hopkins is also gaining<br />\nrespect in disciplines other than<br />\nthe natural sciences, such as<br />\nInternational Relations. One student at the forum pointed to the<br />\nDepartment of Writing Seminars,<br />\nwhich offers a strong writing program separate from the Department of English.<br />\nCiting the small size of classes,<br />\nRichardson said he was \"pretty<br />\noptimistic\" concerning the improvement of attitudes toward<br />\nHopkins as a first choice school<br />\nfor people once considering the<br />\nIvy Leagues.<br />\nRichardson then shifted the<br />\ndiscussion to student activities,<br />\nwanting to know more about the<br />\nContinued on page 3<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThis Week<br />\nWant to know what's hot<br />\nand what's not in summer<br />\nfilms?

The \"Passport<br />\n'91\" theme is the brainchild of<br />\nSpring Fair co-chairperson Kelly Mansfield.<br />\n\"I was thinking about a travel<br />\ntheme because I spent a summer<br />\nabroad,\" Kelly said. \"I've<br />\nalways enjoyed travelling, and<br />\nI've always thought of it as a<br />\ngood part of education.\"<br />\nFestivities begin at noon with<br />\nan address by Hopkins President<br />\nDr. William C.

It's full of prizes donated<br />\nby Stouffer\u2014like a free dinner for<br />\ntwo at the hotel's restauarant or<br />\nmaybe a complimentary room at<br />\nthe hotel. Every spin is<br />\nguaranteed to win something of<br />\ngreater value than the $2 you put<br />\nin.\"<br />\nAccording to Kelly, all the proceeds will go to the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Tutorial Project because \"Stouffer deckled<br />\nthat that was their favorite<br />\n<br />\ncharity.\"<br />\nOther beneficiaries from the<br />\nSpring Fair will be the Mayor's<br />\nCampaign on Literacy.<br />\n\"We will have a new and expanded Fair Games this year, and<br />\nall entry fees will go to benefit the<br />\nMayor's Campaign,\" Rich said.<br />\n\"This year we are opening up a<br />\ncorporate division along with the<br />\nusual college division.

This is<br />\nin response to the many complaints from Hopkins students<br />\nthat groups of young people from<br />\nthe area around campus are<br />\nsomehow getting into the building<br />\nand using facilities which should<br />\nbe available primarily to the<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\nAt present, one officer in<br />\nuniform patrols the building<br />\nseven days a week from 12:00 pm<br />\nto 10:00 pm, the busiest hours of<br />\nthe Athletic Center. The officer<br />\nis responsible for checking the<br />\nIDs of people who appear to have<br />\ncome in from the street or look<br />\nlike they are underage. He will<br />\nrandomly ask to see everyone's<br />\nID, and if he finds that someone<br />\nwho is not from Hopkins and who<br />\nis not a guest of a student is using the Atheletic Center facilities,<br />\nhe will \"escort them out.\"<br />\nMajor Larkin, head of campus<br />\nsecurity, said that the presence of<br />\na uniformed officer helps to deter<br />\noutsiders from finding ways to<br />\nenter the building, but he pointed<br />\nout that the frequent checks for<br />\nIDs are annoying to the students<br />\nwho are legitimately using the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nAccording to Bob Scott, while<br />\nthe presence of the security officer is sometimes helpful in<br />\ndeterring outside people from trying to use the Hopkins Athletic<br />\nCenter, there are still many ways<br />\nin which people can enter the<br />\nbuilding without being checked<br />\nby monitors. The building has ten<br />\n<br />\ndoors leading in and out. While<br />\nthere are usually students stationed at the primary doors to<br />\ncheck the IDs of those who enter,<br />\nit is impossible to cover all the entrances for the many hours that<br />\nthe Athletic Center is open, he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThere are usually four or five<br />\nstudents monitoring per shift. At<br />\ndoors where there are no<br />\nmonitors working, outsiders who<br />\nknock may be let in by Hopkins<br />\nstudents already in the building.<br />\nMany times people wait outside<br />\nthe doors until a student comes<br />\nout, and ask if the student will<br />\nhold the door open for them.<br />\nScott also said that on some occasions students bring guests with<br />\nthem into the building, and this<br />\nperson will then open another<br />\ndoor to let in friends waiting<br />\noutside.<br />\nScott said that monitors not<br />\nshowing up for shifts further<br />\nexarcebates the problem.

Whatever the<br />\nmeans, Seale said, the desired<br />\nend is the same: \"to revolve<br />\nmore.. .power back into the<br />\nhands of the people.\"<br />\nThe fight of everyday<br />\nAmericans\u2014and particularly<br />\nAfrican-Americans\u2014to gain<br />\nsome control over the power held<br />\nby politicans and capitalists was<br />\nthe central theme of Seale's hourlong speech, which traced his<br />\npolitical awakening in 1963<br />\nthrough his founding, with Huey<br />\nP. Newton, of the Black Panther<br />\nParty for Self-Defense in Oakland<br />\nin 1966.<br />\nEarly in that period, he said,<br />\nSeale came to the realization that<br />\n\"I was not a 'nigger.\" Up to that<br />\npoint, he had lived with \"no<br />\n<br />\nsense of who I was as a whole<br />\nhuman being.\" Seale credited<br />\nKenyan political leader 'Jomo<br />\nKenyatta and the American<br />\ntheorist Malcolm X, among<br />\nothers, for his new awareness of<br />\nAfrican-American history and entitlement. \"I was getting a world<br />\nview,\" he said.<br />\nPart of that view was shattered<br />\nin February 1965 with the<br />\nassassination of Malcolm X.<br />\n\"When Malcolm died, I had a<br />\none-man riot\u2014just me, no one<br />\nelse,\" he said, describing the<br />\nrage that led him to throw bricks<br />\nat buildings and passing cars.<br />\nAfter his initial fury, however,<br />\nSeale decided to try to fill the void<br />\nleft by Malcom's death. \"I felt<br />\nobligated to start another<br />\norganization,\" he said, and cited<br />\nMalcom's fledgling Organization<br />\nof Afro-American Unity(OAAU)<br />\nas his model.<br />\nFor assistance, Seale turned to<br />\nfriend Huey P.

Things were slow to<br />\nget started, however. It was not<br />\nuntil Seale and Newton were arrested in spring 1966\u2014after Seale<br />\nrecited the antiwar poem \"Uncle<br />\nSammy Called Me Full of<br />\nLucifer\" to a crowd in<br />\nBerkeley\u2014that the two began to<br />\nbuild the foundation of what was<br />\nto become the Black Panther ParContinued on page 2<br />\n<br />\n\f2/APRIL 19, 1991<br />\n<br />\nSeniors Opt for Grad School<br />\n<br />\nCouncil<br />\nLacks<br />\nQuorum<br />\n<br />\nPoor Job Market Prompts Decisions<br />\n<br />\nby Matt Rosengart<br />\nStudent Council Secretary<br />\nLacking a quorum, which<br />\nmade voting impossible, this<br />\nweek's Student Council meeting<br />\nwas brief.

For a good many of these students, this visit<br />\nwill determine whether or not they will enroll at The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity this fall. Ideally, these students will look past the physical<br />\nstructure of Hopkins and examine all the pros and cons before making their final decision. Hopkins' green suburban-like campus is certainly an advantage, but it camouflages some significant drawbacks<br />\nas well.<br />\nThe price of a Hopkins education obviously ranks high on the cons<br />\nlist\u2014especially since, starting with the Class of 1995, freshmen will<br />\nbe required to live in University housing for two years. Yet compared to other schools of similar stature, Hopkins is not far out of<br />\nline. An almost equivalent education is within reach at some of the<br />\ntop state schools for a great deal less. For in-state students, the price<br />\nis practically unbeatable So is the Hopkins name on your degree<br />\nworth $16,000 plus room and board each year? Sure, the faculty is<br />\ntop-notch, but don't let your tour guide tell you that few classes are<br />\ntaught by teaching assistants. Many of the introductory classes are<br />\nrun by TAs\u2014Contemporary American Letters, among many others,<br />\nis taught exclusively by TAs. Hopkins also employs instructors who<br />\nare professionals\u2014newspaper editors, for instance\u2014who do not have<br />\nPh.Ds.<br />\nWhat is the best way to find out which departments have seasoned<br />\nfaculty? Talk to students\u2014not tour guides, but average students. Stop<br />\npeople walking on the quad or approach people reading under'a tree.<br />\nHopkins students are usually friendly, and some might even talk your<br />\nears off. These students have nothing to gain by giving you good<br />\nor bad reviews, and their opinions and individual experiences can<br />\nprovide valuable insight not available elsewhere in the Open House<br />\nprogram.<br />\nDoes Hopkins have a good football team? Is there a real political<br />\njournal on campus? Be sure to ask your tour guide about extracurriculars and go to the club fair in the Glass Pavilion. Representatives<br />\nfrom most organizations will be on hand to speak with prospective<br />\nfreshmen on Thursday and Friday, April 25 and 26, from 1:00-3:00<br />\n<br />\npm. If you can't reach someone, ask your guide for help and write<br />\na note to the club with your name and address and drop it in campus<br />\nmail. Now is the time to get answers on questions like these. They<br />\nmay seem unimportant, but once you get here you might regret it<br />\nif Hopkins doesn't have the activity for you, while your second-choice<br />\ncollege did. Of course tour guides will be optimistic and say, \"If<br />\nwe don't have the club you're looking for, then you can start your<br />\nown.\" It's not that simple. You need at least ten people and you must<br />\nwrite a constitution to be reviewed by the Student Activities Council. Starting or rejuvenating a student group can be a rewarding experience, but it is not the same experience as being part of a wellfunded, near-professional group at a larger school. If you have the<br />\ntime and energy, go for it. But be warned.<br />\nHousing is another one of those \"whatever\" categories. You might<br />\nbe pickier than you think. Check out AMR II because that's as bad<br />\nas it can get. Most people survive dorm life and even thrive in it,<br />\nbut you might want to take a closer look at where you'll be living<br />\nfor the next two semesters.

I have never, in my<br />\nthree years in Choral Society, heard<br />\nabout students \"willing to perform\"<br />\nas soloists or instrumentalists. Further, neither I, nor any of the other<br />\nofficers, have ever said \"students<br />\nare unreliable.\" We have said that<br />\nwhen we used Peabody students for<br />\ninstrumentalists or soloists, some did<br />\nnot show up at performances!

That means that not recycling all of that aluminum wastes<br />\nas much oil as 150 Exxon Valdez<br />\nspills. Aluminum, glass, white<br />\npaper, newspapers, tin, even<br />\nplastic bottles can be recycled<br />\neasily in Baltimore.<br />\nWhen you buy a product be<br />\nsure that it is reusable or at least<br />\nrecyclable.

Yet, most students<br />\nhave yet to decide one important<br />\ndetail for next year: who will<br />\nrepresent their class on Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nLess than half of the eligible<br />\nstudent voters chose to cast<br />\nballots in Tuesday's primary election. Student Council/Young<br />\nTrustee elections in March fared<br />\nno better. According to Karen<br />\nLevy, Chair of the Board of Elections, only 708 out of 3,069 eligible voters casted their ballot for<br />\nlast month's primaries. In other<br />\nwords, about 23 percent of the<br />\nstudent body voted. For seniors<br />\nvoting for Young Trustee, the<br />\nturnout stood at 17 percent\u2014less<br />\nthan 2 out of 10 people had a hand<br />\nin picking a Young Trustee.<br />\nAbout 20 percent of the<br />\nsophomores and juniors voted,<br />\nwhile 30 percent of the freshmen<br />\npicked a candidate.<br />\nOf all the reasons given by<br />\nstudents for not voting, five continue to make their appearance in<br />\nelection after election. So I drew<br />\nup a list, in no particular order,<br />\nof a student's \"Top Five Reasons<br />\nWhy I Didn't Vote\":<br />\n1. \"Idon't have time to vote.\"<br />\nBusy Hopkins students, whisking<br />\nfrom classes to sports to dinner<br />\njust can't seem to find the time<br />\nto vote. Voting, however, does<br />\nnot gobble up a lot of time. In the<br />\nprimaries on Tuesday, students<br />\ncould vote in less than five<br />\nminutes\u2014depending on the line,<br />\nthe Elections Commissioner on<br />\nduty, the number ofcandidates on<br />\nthe ballot, etc. For next week's<br />\nrun-off, probably with paper<br />\nballots, voting will probably take<br />\nno more than three minutes.<br />\n<br />\nThought Bill Van Horne<br />\n<br />\nAlso, students can vote in more<br />\nthan one place: either in the<br />\ndorms, library, Breezeway, etc.<br />\n2. \"I forgot to vote today.\"<br />\nCampaign posters weighed down<br />\nthe bulletin boards from Gilman<br />\nto the dorms on Tuesday. The<br />\nBoard of Elections posted<br />\nreminders across the campus and<br />\nin the dorms. The News-Letter<br />\nran the times and places that<br />\nvoting booths operated on campus. Candidates swarmed around<br />\ncampus and the dorms, urging<br />\nstudents to vote. Some of the<br />\nmore enterprising candidates<br />\nused chalk and banners to get<br />\ntheir message across. At lunch,<br />\nstudents gossiped about who<br />\nwould win what office, and even<br />\nasked their friends, \"Voted yet?\"<br />\n3. \"I don't know anything<br />\nabout the candidates who are<br />\nrunning. \"Last week, the Board<br />\nof Elections sponsored a Candidates' Forum on campus. Candidates made brief statements,<br />\nthen answered questions from the<br />\naudience. While some freshmen<br />\nmade the trip across campus,only<br />\na very few upperclassmen came<br />\nback to campus to see the Forum.<br />\nThe Board of Elections advertised the Forum in a full-page<br />\nadvertisement in the News-Letter<br />\ntwo weeks ago, listing all of the<br />\ncandidates' names and the times<br />\nfor the various classes. The<br />\nNews-Letter printed all of the candidates' statements in last week's<br />\nissue. In the dorms, candidates<br />\nspoke with fellow students for<br />\ndays before the election, again<br />\nanswering questions they might<br />\nhave.<br />\n4. \"Student Council and class<br />\nofficers don't do anything.\"At<br />\nlast week's Student Council<br />\nmeeting, the Council approved<br />\nnext year's budget, ratified a new<br />\nconstitution, and confirmed committee members picked by the<br />\nCommittee on Committees to<br />\nserve next year. As Council<br />\nmembers know, drawing up the<br />\nbudget takes considerable time<br />\nand effort. Members conducted<br />\nextensive interviews before suggesting funding for groups next<br />\n<br />\nyear. Most student groups, from<br />\nthe Outdoors Club to the Dance<br />\nCompany, receive most or all of<br />\ntheir funding from the Student<br />\nCouncil. Student Council funds<br />\neverything from the Spring Fair<br />\nand the MSE Symposium to the<br />\nHOP and the classes themselves.<br />\nHow much money does the Student Council allocate each year?<br />\nNext year, the Council will give<br />\nstudent groups about $80,000,<br />\nwhich represents just a part of the<br />\n$200,000-plus budget.<br />\nThe Committee on Committees<br />\n(run by the Council Vice President, elected last month) selects<br />\nscores of students to serve on<br />\ncommittees, from the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies to the<br />\nAcademic Ethics Board.<br />\nIn addition, Council oversees<br />\nthe day-to-day Problems at<br />\nHopkins, from security to campus housing to fundraising<br />\nevents.<br />\n5. \"My (one) vote doesn't<br />\ncountfor anything. \"In the Council elections in March, the Board<br />\nof Elections held three separate<br />\nelections for Vice President. On<br />\nthe first ballot, two candidates<br />\ntied (with hundreds of votes cast).<br />\nOn the second ballot, a candidate<br />\nlost by less than five votes. Furthermore, since less than half of<br />\n<br />\nthe students voted on Tuesday,<br />\nyour vote counts even more. In<br />\na sense, your vote remains<br />\ndisproportionately strong, since<br />\nso few people choose to cast a<br />\nballot.<br />\nYet some students who failed<br />\nto vote have one more chance: the<br />\nrun-off on Tuesday. Oddly<br />\nenough, even less people usually vote in the run-off, since they<br />\ndon't know as many candidates<br />\non the ballot as they did in the<br />\nprimaries.(Thus your vote counts<br />\neven more in the run-off.) Unfortunately for the class of 1993, the<br />\noffices of Vice President,<br />\nSecretary, Treasurer, and<br />\nRepresentative probably won't<br />\nrequire run-offs (though write-in<br />\ncandidates could pop up), since<br />\nthe candidates remain either<br />\nunopposed or no candidates petitioned for the office. For the class<br />\nof 1992, also, the primaries will<br />\nalmost surely decide the offices<br />\nof President, Vice President,<br />\nSecretary, and Treasurer, which<br />\nhave only two candidates each.<br />\nDon't complain about student<br />\ngovernment unless you've voted.<br />\nAnd if you've voted, and still<br />\ncomplain, then vote the incumbents out of office.

In addition, we'll have a<br />\nbrunch at the end of it, which is<br />\nalso sponsored by Stouffers and<br />\nthere will be television coverage<br />\nand I believe the mayor's going<br />\nto be there, kicking it off. . .The<br />\nrace is a much bigger deal than<br />\nit was in the past.<br />\nKelly: Fair games is also open to<br />\ncorporations this year.

We feel that this<br />\nis an important change to Spring<br />\nFair because after twenty years,<br />\nwe feel we should give something<br />\nback to the community from<br />\nwhich we draw.<br />\nN-L: What older or traditional attractions will not be seen this<br />\nyear?<br />\nRich: Well, that would be the<br />\nmidway. The midway in past<br />\nyears has been somewhat ailing. . .Student groups that were<br />\ndoing it generally lost a lot of<br />\nmoney. So, instead, this year we<br />\nhave transformed that area into a<br />\ngeneral food, arts & crafts, antiques space.

What special events are you<br />\nplanning?<br />\nKelly: So many special events<br />\nyou could not even see straight.<br />\nFirst of all, we'll be selling a<br />\ncommemorative twentieth anniversary Spring Fair poster at the<br />\ninformation booth for $5. It's absolutely, smashingly fabulouslooking. It's been designed by<br />\nSue Perkins over in Design and<br />\n<br />\nPublications and we can<br />\nguarantee that it'll look great on<br />\nany wall. In addition, we've invited back all the past twenty<br />\nyears of Fair chairs to come and<br />\ncelebrate at a champaigne brunch<br />\nwith us Sunday morning. They<br />\nwill be there in addition to the administrators and support services<br />\npeople who have made Spring<br />\nFair happen over the past twenty<br />\nyears. We've made donations to<br />\nthe archives.<br />\nN-L: How is Spring Fair shaping<br />\nup financially?<br />\nRich: It looks good. We've added a lot of food and arts & crafts<br />\nvendors which gives us a lot more<br />\nstability. We're not counting on<br />\nbeer sales to float Fair financially. Rain or shine, Fair should<br />\nprovide enough money so that we<br />\ncan provide another quality Fair<br />\nnext year.<br />\nN-L: What types of arts & crafts<br />\nand food vendors have you<br />\nsought to attract?<br />\nKelly: We sought to attract a<br />\nvariety of food vendors. With the<br />\narts & crafts vendors, we've had<br />\n<br />\nan overwhelming response this<br />\nyear. We had something like over<br />\n270 applications for 150 spots, so<br />\nwe really sought to attract not only variety but quality and interesting things to this year's<br />\nFair. Hopefully, this year you<br />\nwon't be walking around and seeing jewelry,jewelry,jewelry, tiedye, jewelry, and an occasional<br />\nvendor.<br />\nRich: We try to have all our vendors be. . .true craftsmen. Plus,<br />\nwe have some artists this year,<br />\nwhich is new, that will be<br />\ndisplaying their works and some<br />\nwill be painting at the Fair.<br />\nKelly: In addition, we'll be having an expanded antique section<br />\nlocated on the midway. We're<br />\ntrying to increase the quality and<br />\nquantity of antiques represented<br />\nat Fair this year.<br />\nN-L: Any major unforseen problems or successes in preparation<br />\nfor Fair?<br />\nKelly: None more than<br />\nusual. . .There was a problem a<br />\nday, but that's to be expected.<br />\nRich: Considering the size of the<br />\norganization, Spring Fair actually<br />\nhad had surprisingly few major<br />\nproblems.<br />\nN-L: Is there anything you want<br />\nto say to the weatherman?<br />\nRich and Kelly: We would like<br />\nto refer the weatherman to our<br />\nlegal counsel.<br />\n<br />\nMiranda Act<br />\nContinued from page 4<br />\n\"The key works!\" he announced, tremendously pleased<br />\nwith himself. \"Let's move this<br />\nstuff in!\"<br />\nMiranda looked at the pile of<br />\nfurniture and counted.

Fortunately, in an<br />\nMAC Southeast doubleheader<br />\nWednesday against Washington<br />\nCollege, the winning one did.<br />\nIn both games, the Jays offense<br />\nexploded out of the gate with early runs and the pitchers were just<br />\nbarely able to hang on.<br />\nJeff Fang (5-2) was the victor<br />\nin the 8-5 opener, pitching six<br />\ninnings. The Jays' attack handed<br />\nFang a 7-0 lead, which he never<br />\nrelinquished. Some of the offensive punch came from unlikely<br />\nsources. Joe Kail, the 160-pound<br />\nfreshman shortstop, blasted his<br />\nfirst homer of the year and drove<br />\nin three runs. 3B Sean Holub added three more RBI and LF/P Joe<br />\nTortorello collected three hits to<br />\nhelp Hopkins cruise. In the field,<br />\nthe Jays were flawless, cornmiting no errors and turning a<br />\npair of double plays.<br />\nSeven Jays' runners crossed the<br />\nplate in the first inning of the second game in a 12-8 win. The<br />\nWashington College starter was<br />\nhooked after 1/3 of an inning.<br />\n\"He wasn't that bad of a pitch-<br />\n<br />\ner,\" said outfielder Eric Reid.<br />\n\"We were just upset because we<br />\ndidn't feel we swung the bats that<br />\nwell in the first game, and we<br />\nwanted to get this guy before the<br />\nfifth inning.\"<br />\nOF Ken Brodkowski had a<br />\nphenomenal day, driving in five<br />\nruns and tying 1B Matt Menz for<br />\nthe team lead with his seventh<br />\ndinger. Kail contributed two<br />\nmore RBIs from the leadoff spot.<br />\nSP Digger Walter (4-1) allowed<br />\nfive runs in five innings as the<br />\nJays survived a furious Washington rally. After digging a 12-1<br />\nhole, Washington scored seven<br />\nconsecutive runs before running<br />\nout of gas. Tortorello helped put<br />\nout the fire, recording the final<br />\ntwo outs for his second save.<br />\nThe doubleheader sweep lifted<br />\nthe Jays' overall mark to 15-11-1.<br />\nMore importantly, Hopkins holds<br />\na 6-0 record in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast. Swarthmore, who the<br />\nJays will face in two weeks, appears to be the only challenger to<br />\nthe Conference crown.<br />\n\"The only problem now is that<br />\nwe have a really tough schedule<br />\nahead of us because of all of the<br />\nrainouts we've had,\" stated OF<br />\nJ.

Missner<br />\nOn Wednesday, the Hopkins<br />\nmen's tennis team defeated<br />\nDickinson 5-4. The win upped<br />\nHopkins' record to 4-2. At first<br />\nsingles, Lorin Engquist defeated<br />\nhis opponent 6-2, 6-3. His consistent style of play proved successful once again in his victory.<br />\n\"I'm glad I beat him because he<br />\ndestroyed me last year. Revenge<br />\nis sweet.\"<br />\nIn second singles, Mike Kim,<br />\nwearing his famous funky pants,<br />\nwas defeated 6-4, 6-0. The match<br />\nwas not indicative of the score<br />\nthough, as Mik pyg 45:9.ppo:nent a good, battle.<br />\nAt third singles, Jon Missner<br />\nwas also defeated 6-4, 6-3. His<br />\nopponent had a very aggressive<br />\nstyle of play and proved too tough<br />\nfor Missner.<br />\nKanu \"The Lord\" Jerath<br />\ndestroyed his Dickinson opponent<br />\n6-1, 6-3. Jerath has only one<br />\nsingles loss for the year. \"I was<br />\nquite pleased with this victory,<br />\nalthough a double bagel would<br />\nhave been nice.\"<br />\nBill Braude, playing number<br />\nfive singles, won 6-1, 7-5.<br />\nBraude outlasted a tough second<br />\nset to win the match. \"After my<br />\ndisappointing loss last week to<br />\nUrsinus, I was psyched to win<br />\n<br />\nthis one.\"<br />\nSam Kim, playing number six,<br />\nlost 6-4, 6-4. Recovering from a<br />\ngroin injury, Sam put up a good<br />\nfight. \"The icing on my groin<br />\nworked, although I was just a little bit off.\"<br />\nAfter the singles matches, the<br />\nteam score was three matches to<br />\nthree matches. However<br />\nHopkins' strength, the doubles,<br />\ncame through.<br />\nAt first doubles, Jon Missner<br />\nand Bill Braude lost a heartbreaker 7-5, 4-6, 7-5. It was their<br />\nfirst loss of the year and quite<br />\ndisappointing. \"I hope we still<br />\nhave \u2022a shot of being seeded at<br />\nMAC's,\" Braude said after the<br />\ntough loss.<br />\nSecond and third doubles won<br />\nrespectively, 6-3, 6-4, and 6-4,<br />\n6-4.

After beginning the season by dominating<br />\nthree matches, Hopkins fell to<br />\nDickinson 7-1 on Thursday,<br />\nApril 11.<br />\n\"Dickinson was an overall<br />\nstrong team. We also had a tough<br />\ntime adjusting to the weather. It<br />\nwas so windy that it was very difficult to judge how the tennis ball<br />\nwould move,\" commented Katie<br />\nStein, the number five player.<br />\nStein continued,\"We are back<br />\nto no-ad scoring and that often affects the score when we play<br />\ngood teams. In my match many<br />\nof the games were lost on deuce,<br />\nso this way of scoring definitely<br />\nhurt our team.\"<br />\nTamar Hausman, the number<br />\none player, was the only Hopkins<br />\ncompetitor to win her match. She<br />\nbeat her opponent decisively in<br />\ntwo quick sets.<br />\nAfter the singles competition,<br />\nHausman teamed with Dawn<br />\nStoner to play the number one<br />\ndoubles competition. This is their<br />\nsecond year playing together and<br />\nthey have a winning record this<br />\nseason.<br />\nAt the Dickinson match,<br />\nHausman explained, \"Dawn and<br />\nI usually play well together, but<br />\nwe also need to get psyched<br />\ntogether. Sometimes one of us<br />\n<br />\nwill have a long match and it's<br />\ndifficult to play another match<br />\nright after it.\"<br />\nHopkins was scheduled to play<br />\nElizabethtown on Saturday the<br />\n13th, but the game was rained<br />\n,out. This is the second match this<br />\nseason that has either been<br />\ncancelled or postponed.<br />\nThe weather was better on<br />\nTuesday the 16th, but the team<br />\nsuffered a devastating loss to<br />\nFranklin and Marshall. Not one<br />\nof the Hopkins competitors was<br />\nable to win a match, and they left<br />\nLancaster with a 0-9 loss.<br />\nHausman commented,\"I really should have beaten the girl I<br />\nplayed. This season I won a<br />\nmatch against someone who has<br />\nbeaten the Franklin and Marshall<br />\nplayer.<br />\n-was very good,<br />\nthough, and she knew just how to<br />\nplay me. She continually sliced to<br />\nthe backhand.\"<br />\nStoner also played well, but her<br />\ncompetitor was a \"pusher.\"<br />\nHausman elaborated, \"Pushers '<br />\nare difficult to beat because they<br />\nget to every ball, but they don't<br />\nthink about where to place their<br />\nreturn shot.\"<br />\nThe Franklin and Marshall<br />\nteam had added a lot of new<br />\nplayers to their roster and thus the<br />\nteam's methods of playing was<br />\nunfamiliar. Stein added,<br />\n\"Franklin and Marshall has a<br />\ngood team in almost every sport<br />\nand tennis is no exception.\"<br />\n<br />\nRejuvenated Crews<br />\nLook Toward LaSalle<br />\n<br />\nContinued from page 1.3<br />\nThe women's novice eight, facing a strong field which included<br />\nboats from Navy, Georgetown,<br />\nand Temple, failed to qualify for<br />\nthe finals, finishing seventh out<br />\nof twelve. The men's novice<br />\neight, rowing against powerful<br />\nheavyweights, also failed to'<br />\nqualify, falling in their heat to<br />\nboats from Navy, Drexel, and<br />\nGeorge Mason.<br />\n\"I think the first 1500 meters<br />\nof our race really didn't show<br />\nwhat our boat could do, but I<br />\nthink we settled down and<br />\nrowed really well in the last 500<br />\nmeters,\" said freshman Stephanie<br />\nFishkin, coxswain of the<br />\nwomen's novice eight.<br />\n\"Our crew did comparatively<br />\nwell,\" said Jesse Chu,freshman<br />\ncoxswain of the men's novice<br />\neight, \"especially considering<br />\nthat we were rowing against<br />\nheavyweights from very strong<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\n, Like the women's heavyweight<br />\nfour, the men's heavyweight four<br />\nwas struggling with an injury of<br />\nits own which forced the men's<br />\nfour to withdraw from last Saturday's race. Junior Eric Plautz<br />\ndeveloped back problems late in<br />\nthe week,and unlike the women's<br />\nfour which had notice of Ehringer's injury, the men's four was<br />\nunable to replace Plautz on such<br />\nshort notice. Plautz has been<br />\nrecovering this week and should<br />\nbe able to row this Saturday at the<br />\nLaSalle Invitational, which is<br />\ngood news for the men's four<br />\nwho will be facing such crews as<br />\nLaSalle, SUNY Maritime, and<br />\nVassar.<br />\n\"My back's a lot better, but it's<br />\nstill not 100 percent. The trainer<br />\nsaid it's something that will probably nag me, but shouldn't prevent me from rowing,.\" said<br />\n<br />\nPlautz.<br />\nLike Plautz, Ehringer is hoping to return to her boat this<br />\nweek. Ehringer has maintained<br />\nher strength and conditioning by<br />\nswimming and doing some back<br />\nexercises, but notes that returning after nearly a week and a half<br />\nwill not be automatic.<br />\n\"I feel out of touch with the<br />\nwater. Our boat has made some<br />\ntechnical adjustments since I've<br />\nbeen away, so I've got to come<br />\nback and make those adjustments,<br />\ntoo,\" said Ehringer.<br />\nOne of the adjustments the<br />\nwomen's four is trying to make<br />\nis to become more aggressive in<br />\ntheir stroke, as well as to return<br />\nto the more polished style they<br />\nexhibited earlier in the year. They<br />\nwill have a chance to do that this<br />\nSaturday when they row against<br />\nanother competitive field at<br />\nLaSalle, a field which, among<br />\nother boats, should include boats<br />\nfrom Carnegie Mellon, LaSalle,<br />\nand Lehigh.<br />\nLike the women's four, the<br />\nmen's lightweight is trying to<br />\nmake adjustments in its racing<br />\nstyle.<br />\n\"Right now, we usually try to<br />\nsprint out to an early lead, within<br />\nthe first 200 meters and then try<br />\nto sit on the other boats for the<br />\nrest of the race,\" said Porcarelli.<br />\n\"What we're going to try to do<br />\nis still start out strong, but not<br />\nthink we have to lead the whole<br />\nrace.

Richardson held the third and final<br />\nstudents' open forum of the<br />\nspring semester at the Nichols<br />\nHouse on Wednesday, April 17.<br />\nRichardson began the informal<br />\ngathering by explaining the purpose of the forum. He said that<br />\nhe wanted to provide opportunities for students to express<br />\nwhat was on their minds.<br />\nRichardson discussed the most<br />\npressing issue that he is faced<br />\nwith right now\u2014the auditing of<br />\nHopkins' government research<br />\ngrants. He said that he spends<br />\nmuch of his time in Annapolis or<br />\nWashington meeting with<br />\nlegislators to discuss the issue of<br />\nindirect costs in connection with<br />\nfederal grants.<br />\nRichardson appeared confident<br />\nthat the screens set up to catch unnecessary spending of federal<br />\ndollars had been effective.<br />\n\"Our basic system is very<br />\nsound,\" he said. \"Hopkins traditionally had taken a very conservative stance. We should know in<br />\na matter of months what the<br />\nauditors have found.\"<br />\nGoing on to cite Hopkins as the<br />\nnation's number one university<br />\nrecipient of research grants, he<br />\npointed to the benefits gained<br />\nfrom such a distinction. The<br />\nmoney is earned competitively<br />\nand speaks highly of our faculty,<br />\nhe said. In addition, the grants<br />\nbring the University into national<br /><br />\nfocus and provide students with<br />\nfacilities and resources not readily<br />\navailable at other undergraduate<br />\ninstitutions of comparable size.<br />\nRichardson then discussed the<br />\nimage that Hopkins presents to<br />\nprospective students and to the<br />\neducational community. The<br />\nperennial competition with Ivy<br />\nLeague schools was mentioned,<br />\nbut only in reference to Hopkins'<br />\nsuccess in withstanding it.<br />\nRichardson noted the admissions<br />\nstatistics to illustrate Hopkins'<br />\ngrowing popularity and reputation as a prestigious university.<br />\nApplications for admission were<br />\nup 17% and the number of National Merit Semifinalists<br />\ndesignating Hopkins as their first<br />\nchoice also rose markedly.<br />\nThe President made note of the<br />\nfact that Hopkins is also gaining<br />\nrespect in disciplines other than<br />\nthe natural sciences, such as<br />\nInternational Relations. One student at the forum pointed to the<br />\nDepartment of Writing Seminars,<br />\nwhich offers a strong writing program separate from the Department of English.<br />\nCiting the small size of classes,<br />\nRichardson said he was \"pretty<br />\noptimistic\" concerning the improvement of attitudes toward<br />\nHopkins as a first choice school<br />\nfor people once considering the<br />\nIvy Leagues.<br />\nRichardson then shifted the<br />\ndiscussion to student activities,<br />\nwanting to know more about the<br />\nContinued on page 3<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nThis Week<br />\nWant to know what's hot<br />\nand what's not in summer<br />\nfilms?

The \"Passport<br />\n'91\" theme is the brainchild of<br />\nSpring Fair co-chairperson Kelly Mansfield.<br />\n\"I was thinking about a travel<br />\ntheme because I spent a summer<br />\nabroad,\" Kelly said. \"I've<br />\nalways enjoyed travelling, and<br />\nI've always thought of it as a<br />\ngood part of education.\"<br />\nFestivities begin at noon with<br />\nan address by Hopkins President<br />\nDr. William C. Richardson on-a<br />\nnew stage donated by The Stouffer Harborplace Hotel.<br />\n\"Caroline MacEnrue of<br />\nWBAL-TV will be the M.C. for<br />\nthe opening ceremonies,\" cochair Rich Quarles said. \"To go<br />\nalong with the theme of promoting different cultures there<br />\nwill be dancers on the stages\u2014<br />\nfrom Ukrainian troupes to Irish<br />\ndancers\u2014 and other cultural performers. There will be a hot air<br />\nballoon on Garland field that will<br />\ngo up. And then there will be the<br />\naudition for the Spring Fair<br /><br />\nfanfare.\"<br />\nAs in past years, the upper and<br />\nlower quads will have over 50<br />\nfood booths that will satisfy all<br />\nappetites, ranging from studentrun booths like the Chinese<br />\nStudents Association's Chinese<br />\nfood to local restauranteurs like<br />\nAkbar's Indian fare.

This is<br />\nin response to the many complaints from Hopkins students<br />\nthat groups of young people from<br />\nthe area around campus are<br />\nsomehow getting into the building<br />\nand using facilities which should<br />\nbe available primarily to the<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\nAt present, one officer in<br />\nuniform patrols the building<br />\nseven days a week from 12:00 pm<br />\nto 10:00 pm, the busiest hours of<br />\nthe Athletic Center. The officer<br />\nis responsible for checking the<br />\nIDs of people who appear to have<br />\ncome in from the street or look<br />\nlike they are underage. He will<br />\nrandomly ask to see everyone's<br />\nID, and if he finds that someone<br />\nwho is not from Hopkins and who<br />\nis not a guest of a student is using the Atheletic Center facilities,<br />\nhe will \"escort them out.\"<br />\nMajor Larkin, head of campus<br />\nsecurity, said that the presence of<br />\na uniformed officer helps to deter<br />\noutsiders from finding ways to<br />\nenter the building, but he pointed<br />\nout that the frequent checks for<br />\nIDs are annoying to the students<br />\nwho are legitimately using the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nAccording to Bob Scott, while<br />\nthe presence of the security officer is sometimes helpful in<br />\ndeterring outside people from trying to use the Hopkins Athletic<br />\nCenter, there are still many ways<br />\nin which people can enter the<br />\nbuilding without being checked<br />\nby monitors. The building has ten<br /><br />\ndoors leading in and out. While<br />\nthere are usually students stationed at the primary doors to<br />\ncheck the IDs of those who enter,<br />\nit is impossible to cover all the entrances for the many hours that<br />\nthe Athletic Center is open, he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThere are usually four or five<br />\nstudents monitoring per shift. At<br />\ndoors where there are no<br />\nmonitors working, outsiders who<br />\nknock may be let in by Hopkins<br />\nstudents already in the building.<br />\nMany times people wait outside<br />\nthe doors until a student comes<br />\nout, and ask if the student will<br />\nhold the door open for them.<br />\nScott also said that on some occasions students bring guests with<br />\nthem into the building, and this<br />\nperson will then open another<br />\ndoor to let in friends waiting<br />\noutside.<br />\nScott said that monitors not<br />\nshowing up for shifts further<br />\nexarcebates the problem.

Kern<br />\nInsisting that \"more than just<br />\nrhetoric\" would be necessary to<br />\ncure America's social ills, activist<br />\nand author Bobby Seale Wednesday night called upon college<br />\nstudents to organize \"community grass-roots action programs\"<br />\nas the first of many steps towards<br />\na \"revolution\" in American<br />\npolitics and society.<br />\nSeale encouraged the standingroom-only crowd in Mergenthaler Auditorium to reconsider<br />\ntheir definition of \"revolution.\"<br />\nRevolution does not necessarily<br />\nhave to be violent, he said; it can<br />\nbe accomplished through<br />\nphenomena as diverse as voting,<br />\nsocial programs, and acute<br />\npolitical awareness. Whatever the<br />\nmeans, Seale said, the desired<br />\nend is the same: \"to revolve<br />\nmore.. .power back into the<br />\nhands of the people.\"<br />\nThe fight of everyday<br />\nAmericans\u2014and particularly<br />\nAfrican-Americans\u2014to gain<br />\nsome control over the power held<br />\nby politicans and capitalists was<br />\nthe central theme of Seale's hourlong speech, which traced his<br />\npolitical awakening in 1963<br />\nthrough his founding, with Huey<br />\nP. Newton, of the Black Panther<br />\nParty for Self-Defense in Oakland<br />\nin 1966.<br />\nEarly in that period, he said,<br />\nSeale came to the realization that<br />\n\"I was not a 'nigger.\" Up to that<br />\npoint, he had lived with \"no<br /><br />\nsense of who I was as a whole<br />\nhuman being.\" Seale credited<br />\nKenyan political leader 'Jomo<br />\nKenyatta and the American<br />\ntheorist Malcolm X, among<br />\nothers, for his new awareness of<br />\nAfrican-American history and entitlement. \"I was getting a world<br />\nview,\" he said.<br />\nPart of that view was shattered<br />\nin February 1965 with the<br />\nassassination of Malcolm X.<br />\n\"When Malcolm died, I had a<br />\none-man riot\u2014just me, no one<br />\nelse,\" he said, describing the<br />\nrage that led him to throw bricks<br />\nat buildings and passing cars.<br />\nAfter his initial fury, however,<br />\nSeale decided to try to fill the void<br />\nleft by Malcom's death. \"I felt<br />\nobligated to start another<br />\norganization,\" he said, and cited<br />\nMalcom's fledgling Organization<br />\nof Afro-American Unity(OAAU)<br />\nas his model.<br />\nFor assistance, Seale turned to<br />\nfriend Huey P.

Things were slow to<br />\nget started, however. It was not<br />\nuntil Seale and Newton were arrested in spring 1966\u2014after Seale<br />\nrecited the antiwar poem \"Uncle<br />\nSammy Called Me Full of<br />\nLucifer\" to a crowd in<br />\nBerkeley\u2014that the two began to<br />\nbuild the foundation of what was<br />\nto become the Black Panther ParContinued on page 2<br /><br />\n2/APRIL 19, 1991<br /><br />\nSeniors Opt for Grad School<br /><br />\nCouncil<br />\nLacks<br />\nQuorum<br /><br />\nPoor Job Market Prompts Decisions<br /><br />\nby Matt Rosengart<br />\nStudent Council Secretary<br />\nLacking a quorum, which<br />\nmade voting impossible, this<br />\nweek's Student Council meeting<br />\nwas brief.

For a good many of these students, this visit<br />\nwill determine whether or not they will enroll at The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity this fall. Ideally, these students will look past the physical<br />\nstructure of Hopkins and examine all the pros and cons before making their final decision. Hopkins' green suburban-like campus is certainly an advantage, but it camouflages some significant drawbacks<br />\nas well.<br />\nThe price of a Hopkins education obviously ranks high on the cons<br />\nlist\u2014especially since, starting with the Class of 1995, freshmen will<br />\nbe required to live in University housing for two years. Yet compared to other schools of similar stature, Hopkins is not far out of<br />\nline. An almost equivalent education is within reach at some of the<br />\ntop state schools for a great deal less. For in-state students, the price<br />\nis practically unbeatable So is the Hopkins name on your degree<br />\nworth $16,000 plus room and board each year? Sure, the faculty is<br />\ntop-notch, but don't let your tour guide tell you that few classes are<br />\ntaught by teaching assistants. Many of the introductory classes are<br />\nrun by TAs\u2014Contemporary American Letters, among many others,<br />\nis taught exclusively by TAs. Hopkins also employs instructors who<br />\nare professionals\u2014newspaper editors, for instance\u2014who do not have<br />\nPh.Ds.<br />\nWhat is the best way to find out which departments have seasoned<br />\nfaculty? Talk to students\u2014not tour guides, but average students. Stop<br />\npeople walking on the quad or approach people reading under'a tree.<br />\nHopkins students are usually friendly, and some might even talk your<br />\nears off. These students have nothing to gain by giving you good<br />\nor bad reviews, and their opinions and individual experiences can<br />\nprovide valuable insight not available elsewhere in the Open House<br />\nprogram.<br />\nDoes Hopkins have a good football team? Is there a real political<br />\njournal on campus? Be sure to ask your tour guide about extracurriculars and go to the club fair in the Glass Pavilion. Representatives<br />\nfrom most organizations will be on hand to speak with prospective<br />\nfreshmen on Thursday and Friday, April 25 and 26, from 1:00-3:00<br /><br />\npm. If you can't reach someone, ask your guide for help and write<br />\na note to the club with your name and address and drop it in campus<br />\nmail. Now is the time to get answers on questions like these. They<br />\nmay seem unimportant, but once you get here you might regret it<br />\nif Hopkins doesn't have the activity for you, while your second-choice<br />\ncollege did. Of course tour guides will be optimistic and say, \"If<br />\nwe don't have the club you're looking for, then you can start your<br />\nown.\" It's not that simple. You need at least ten people and you must<br />\nwrite a constitution to be reviewed by the Student Activities Council. Starting or rejuvenating a student group can be a rewarding experience, but it is not the same experience as being part of a wellfunded, near-professional group at a larger school. If you have the<br />\ntime and energy, go for it. But be warned.<br />\nHousing is another one of those \"whatever\" categories. You might<br />\nbe pickier than you think. Check out AMR II because that's as bad<br />\nas it can get. Most people survive dorm life and even thrive in it,<br />\nbut you might want to take a closer look at where you'll be living<br />\nfor the next two semesters. Again, talk to students who are living<br />\nin the dorms. If you can spend a night in one of the dorms, you might<br />\nbenefit as well.<br />\nThe Hopkins campus is relatively safe. There are security phones<br />\nlocated at the ends of the freshman quad and throughout the campus. Hopkins Security has improved the lighting around campus, but<br />\nareas such as the Gilman quad in front of the Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary are still quite dark at night. Students should not be lulled<br />\ninto a false sense of security and walk alone at night; a student was<br />\nraped on campus in February. In general, Hopkins is safer than Columbia or the University of Pennsylvania, for example. But obviously, it is located in a city, where crime is more prevalent than in the<br />\noutskirts.<br />\nRemember to look at the total picture before committing yourself.<br />\nHopkins can no doubt offer you a diversified environment with<br />\nstudents who hail from all over the world; like most schools, however,<br />\nit is far from perfect. It is up to you to decide whether or not Hopkins<br />\nis the right place for you.

His feelings had no place in the<br />\narticle; we can read his column for<br />\nthat.<br />\nJusick never explains WHY the<br />\nChoral Society has a deficit. Last<br />\nspring, our president said a budget<br />\nhad been submitted, and in August,<br />\nthe SAC Office agreed\u2014incorrectly,<br />\nit turns out\u2014that this money was indeed granted.

It<br />\nwasn't until October that we heard<br />\notherwise.<br />\nWhen the SAC froze our budget,<br />\nwe stopped all the spending we<br />\ncould. We continued to hire an ac-<br /><br />\ncompanist; without one we cannot<br />\nhave rehearsals.<br />\nSince then, Choral Society has<br />\nbeen fundraising, and has cut spending drastically.<br />\nWe submitted a budget for<br />\n1991-92, as requested, on time.<br /><br />\nSince we are on probation, we must<br />\nrequest each item individually next<br />\nyear. Of course, the SAC Board<br />\ndidn't inform us of this at our budget<br />\nhearing; it only came to our attention at the General Meeting.<br />\nJusick was not content to merely<br />\nexplain (rather, partially explain)<br />\nour problems. He continued with his<br />\npersonal complaints about the group,<br />\nwhich had no place here. As president, I have a fair knowledge of our<br />\nmembership. I have never, in my<br />\nthree years in Choral Society, heard<br />\nabout students \"willing to perform\"<br />\nas soloists or instrumentalists. Further, neither I, nor any of the other<br />\nofficers, have ever said \"students<br />\nare unreliable.\" We have said that<br />\nwhen we used Peabody students for<br />\ninstrumentalists or soloists, some did<br />\nnot show up at performances! We<br />\ncannot work with this uncertainty.<br />\nContracted performers are under<br />\nobligation to be there, and always<br />\nare.

In 1970, the first<br />\nEarth Day was organized to<br />\ngalvanize the American people<br />\nand our government to environmental action. Last year,<br />\nEarth Week touched nearly every<br />\ncountry on the globe. Earth Day<br />\nshows our leaders how important<br />\nenvironmental issues are; more<br />\nimportantly, it is meant as a day<br />\nto try the first steps towards an<br />\nenvironmentally sound lifestyle.<br />\nThe first step is dealing with<br />\nour garbage. The average<br />\nAmerican throws away three and<br />\na half pounds of garbage every<br />\nweek.

SEA and<br /><br />\nCustodial Services have a recycling project on campus. Off campus, some areas have curbside<br />\nrecycling, while others have rolloffs where you can take your<br />\nrecyclables. Call 396-SORT for<br />\nmore information. Recycling one<br />\ncan of aluminum saves the energy<br />\nequivalent to that can half-full of<br />\ngasoline. Americans waste<br />\nenough aluminum every three<br />\nmonths to rebuild the entire<br />\nAmerican commercial airline<br />\nfleet. That means that not recycling all of that aluminum wastes<br />\nas much oil as 150 Exxon Valdez<br />\nspills. Aluminum, glass, white<br />\npaper, newspapers, tin, even<br />\nplastic bottles can be recycled<br />\neasily in Baltimore.<br />\nWhen you buy a product be<br />\nsure that it is reusable or at least<br />\nrecyclable. Also, buy recycled<br />\nproducts. Recycled paper is as<br />\ngood and as cheap as virgin<br />\npaper, and it saves trees. Buying<br />\nintelligently is an important part<br />\nof your role in the American<br />\neconomy. Be aware of whether or<br />\nnot you wish to support certain<br />\ncompanies.

Classes grind to a halt, exams loom mightily in the<br />\ndistance, and friends chatter over<br />\ntheir plans for their four months<br />\nof freedom. April remains a<br />\nmonth of change as the spring<br />\ntries to shake off the last remnants<br />\nof winter. As students prepare for<br />\ntheir mass exodus from campus,<br />\nmost remember that they will<br />\nin<br />\npredictably,<br />\nreturn,<br />\nSeptember. Yet, most students<br />\nhave yet to decide one important<br />\ndetail for next year: who will<br />\nrepresent their class on Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nLess than half of the eligible<br />\nstudent voters chose to cast<br />\nballots in Tuesday's primary election. Student Council/Young<br />\nTrustee elections in March fared<br />\nno better. According to Karen<br />\nLevy, Chair of the Board of Elections, only 708 out of 3,069 eligible voters casted their ballot for<br />\nlast month's primaries. In other<br />\nwords, about 23 percent of the<br />\nstudent body voted. For seniors<br />\nvoting for Young Trustee, the<br />\nturnout stood at 17 percent\u2014less<br />\nthan 2 out of 10 people had a hand<br />\nin picking a Young Trustee.<br />\nAbout 20 percent of the<br />\nsophomores and juniors voted,<br />\nwhile 30 percent of the freshmen<br />\npicked a candidate.<br />\nOf all the reasons given by<br />\nstudents for not voting, five continue to make their appearance in<br />\nelection after election. So I drew<br />\nup a list, in no particular order,<br />\nof a student's \"Top Five Reasons<br />\nWhy I Didn't Vote\":<br />\n1. \"Idon't have time to vote.\"<br />\nBusy Hopkins students, whisking<br />\nfrom classes to sports to dinner<br />\njust can't seem to find the time<br />\nto vote. Voting, however, does<br />\nnot gobble up a lot of time. In the<br />\nprimaries on Tuesday, students<br />\ncould vote in less than five<br />\nminutes\u2014depending on the line,<br />\nthe Elections Commissioner on<br />\nduty, the number ofcandidates on<br />\nthe ballot, etc. For next week's<br />\nrun-off, probably with paper<br />\nballots, voting will probably take<br />\nno more than three minutes.<br /><br />\nThought Bill Van Horne<br /><br />\nAlso, students can vote in more<br />\nthan one place: either in the<br />\ndorms, library, Breezeway, etc.<br />\n2. \"I forgot to vote today.\"<br />\nCampaign posters weighed down<br />\nthe bulletin boards from Gilman<br />\nto the dorms on Tuesday. The<br />\nBoard of Elections posted<br />\nreminders across the campus and<br />\nin the dorms. The News-Letter<br />\nran the times and places that<br />\nvoting booths operated on campus. Candidates swarmed around<br />\ncampus and the dorms, urging<br />\nstudents to vote. Some of the<br />\nmore enterprising candidates<br />\nused chalk and banners to get<br />\ntheir message across. At lunch,<br />\nstudents gossiped about who<br />\nwould win what office, and even<br />\nasked their friends, \"Voted yet?\"<br />\n3. \"I don't know anything<br />\nabout the candidates who are<br />\nrunning. \"Last week, the Board<br />\nof Elections sponsored a Candidates' Forum on campus. Candidates made brief statements,<br />\nthen answered questions from the<br />\naudience. While some freshmen<br />\nmade the trip across campus,only<br />\na very few upperclassmen came<br />\nback to campus to see the Forum.<br />\nThe Board of Elections advertised the Forum in a full-page<br />\nadvertisement in the News-Letter<br />\ntwo weeks ago, listing all of the<br />\ncandidates' names and the times<br />\nfor the various classes. The<br />\nNews-Letter printed all of the candidates' statements in last week's<br />\nissue. In the dorms, candidates<br />\nspoke with fellow students for<br />\ndays before the election, again<br />\nanswering questions they might<br />\nhave.<br />\n4. \"Student Council and class<br />\nofficers don't do anything.\"At<br />\nlast week's Student Council<br />\nmeeting, the Council approved<br />\nnext year's budget, ratified a new<br />\nconstitution, and confirmed committee members picked by the<br />\nCommittee on Committees to<br />\nserve next year. As Council<br />\nmembers know, drawing up the<br />\nbudget takes considerable time<br />\nand effort. Members conducted<br />\nextensive interviews before suggesting funding for groups next<br /><br />\nyear. Most student groups, from<br />\nthe Outdoors Club to the Dance<br />\nCompany, receive most or all of<br />\ntheir funding from the Student<br />\nCouncil. Student Council funds<br />\neverything from the Spring Fair<br />\nand the MSE Symposium to the<br />\nHOP and the classes themselves.<br />\nHow much money does the Student Council allocate each year?<br />\nNext year, the Council will give<br />\nstudent groups about $80,000,<br />\nwhich represents just a part of the<br />\n$200,000-plus budget.<br />\nThe Committee on Committees<br />\n(run by the Council Vice President, elected last month) selects<br />\nscores of students to serve on<br />\ncommittees, from the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies to the<br />\nAcademic Ethics Board.<br />\nIn addition, Council oversees<br />\nthe day-to-day Problems at<br />\nHopkins, from security to campus housing to fundraising<br />\nevents.<br />\n5. \"My (one) vote doesn't<br />\ncountfor anything. \"In the Council elections in March, the Board<br />\nof Elections held three separate<br />\nelections for Vice President. On<br />\nthe first ballot, two candidates<br />\ntied (with hundreds of votes cast).<br />\nOn the second ballot, a candidate<br />\nlost by less than five votes. Furthermore, since less than half of<br /><br />\nthe students voted on Tuesday,<br />\nyour vote counts even more. In<br />\na sense, your vote remains<br />\ndisproportionately strong, since<br />\nso few people choose to cast a<br />\nballot.<br />\nYet some students who failed<br />\nto vote have one more chance: the<br />\nrun-off on Tuesday. Oddly<br />\nenough, even less people usually vote in the run-off, since they<br />\ndon't know as many candidates<br />\non the ballot as they did in the<br />\nprimaries.(Thus your vote counts<br />\neven more in the run-off.) Unfortunately for the class of 1993, the<br />\noffices of Vice President,<br />\nSecretary, Treasurer, and<br />\nRepresentative probably won't<br />\nrequire run-offs (though write-in<br />\ncandidates could pop up), since<br />\nthe candidates remain either<br />\nunopposed or no candidates petitioned for the office. For the class<br />\nof 1992, also, the primaries will<br />\nalmost surely decide the offices<br />\nof President, Vice President,<br />\nSecretary, and Treasurer, which<br />\nhave only two candidates each.<br />\nDon't complain about student<br />\ngovernment unless you've voted.<br />\nAnd if you've voted, and still<br />\ncomplain, then vote the incumbents out of office.

The<br /><br />\nSpring Fair Highlights:<br />\nWell Isn't That Special<br />\nby Evelyn Jerome<br />\nSpring Fair will open in grandiose style this year, according to<br />\nSpecial Events co-chairs Lisa<br />\nScorsolini and Paul Robinson.

The balloon will rise<br />\nabove Garland Field. Scorsolini<br />\ncommented that the balloon is<br />\nsupposed to remind onlookers of<br />\n\"Around the World in 80 Days,\"<br />\nin keeping with the theme of<br />\n\"Passport '91: A Trip Around<br />\nthe World.\"<br />\nOn Saturday, Heltshe will offer tethered balloon flights to<br />\nSpring Fair visitors for five<br />\ndollars per person, with the proceeds going to the Special Olympics. All balloon activities, of<br />\ncourse, depend on the weather.<br />\nTo usher Fair in musically, the<br />\nHopkins Modern Brass Quintet<br />\nwill play in front of Garland<br />\nField. The patio, previously<br />\nGarland Stage, has been renamed Stouffer Stage, to honor a<br />\ngenerous donation to Spring Fair<br />\nfrom the Stouffer Harborplace<br />\nHotel. President Richardson will<br />\ngive a welcome address to begin<br />\nthe festivities.

We feel that this<br />\nis an important change to Spring<br />\nFair because after twenty years,<br />\nwe feel we should give something<br />\nback to the community from<br />\nwhich we draw.<br />\nN-L: What older or traditional attractions will not be seen this<br />\nyear?<br />\nRich: Well, that would be the<br />\nmidway. The midway in past<br />\nyears has been somewhat ailing. . .Student groups that were<br />\ndoing it generally lost a lot of<br />\nmoney. So, instead, this year we<br />\nhave transformed that area into a<br />\ngeneral food, arts &amp; crafts, antiques space. We have a professional company doing the midway booths which will be located<br />\nwith the big amusement rides.<br />\nThere won't be the helium<br />\nballoon ascension this year due to<br />\nenvironmental concerns. Instead,<br />\nwe're going to have a big hot-air<br />\nballoon, which is a lot cooler<br />\nanyway.<br />\nN-L: Where did the Passport '91<br />\ntheme come from?<br />\nKelly: I had studied abroad last<br />\nyear and travelling had become<br />\na very important part of my life<br />\nand I decided to incorporate it<br />\nsomehow into Spring Fair. When<br />\nI approached Rich with some<br />\nideas, we bounced them off one<br />\nanother until finally we came up<br />\nwith Passport '91: A Trip Around<br />\nthe World.<br />\nRich (sarcastically): I thought it<br />\nwas possibly the best idea I had<br />\never heard of in my life and immediately endorsed it.<br />\nN-L: Are there any events<br />\nplanned just for students this<br />\nyear?<br />\nKelly: Certainly.<br />\nRich: Of course. Why, as<br />\nalways, Nighttime activities will<br />\nbe just for students. If you don't<br />\nhave a college ID you can't.get<br />\nin. We're very excited about this<br />\nyear's Nighttime entertainment,<br />\nwhich will include such exciting<br />\nbands as.. .<br />\nKelly: . . . Uncle Tupelo, Ten<br />\nTimes Big, Final Chapter,<br />\nScram, Uprising, Abby Normal,<br />\nand the Pearl Fishers. . .There<br />\nwill be beer available for those<br />\npeople over 21 with two valid<br />\nIDs.<br />\nRich: . . .there will also be an independent film -rnfiker forum on<br />\nFriday, which will be in Shriver,<br />\nwhich is kinda' cool. It's a dollar<br /><br />\nat the door and all proceeds go to<br />\nthe film-makers.<br />\nKelly: . . .it's open to the public.<br />\nRich: . . .that is, open to the<br />\npublic and its just Baltimore independent film folks showing<br />\ntheir stuff.<br />\nN-L: Do you have any recommendations for future Fairs?<br />\nKelly: Any recommendations we<br />\nmight have for future Fairs will<br />\nbe going in an extensive report<br />\nthat we will be delivering to the<br />\nStudent Activities Office as well<br />\nas several deans.<br />\nRich: But, in general, have fun<br />\nwith it. . .That's our advice.<br />\nN-L: I understand this is the<br />\ntwentieth anniversary of Spring<br />\nFair. What special events are you<br />\nplanning?<br />\nKelly: So many special events<br />\nyou could not even see straight.<br />\nFirst of all, we'll be selling a<br />\ncommemorative twentieth anniversary Spring Fair poster at the<br />\ninformation booth for $5. It's absolutely, smashingly fabulouslooking. It's been designed by<br />\nSue Perkins over in Design and<br /><br />\nPublications and we can<br />\nguarantee that it'll look great on<br />\nany wall. In addition, we've invited back all the past twenty<br />\nyears of Fair chairs to come and<br />\ncelebrate at a champaigne brunch<br />\nwith us Sunday morning. They<br />\nwill be there in addition to the administrators and support services<br />\npeople who have made Spring<br />\nFair happen over the past twenty<br />\nyears. We've made donations to<br />\nthe archives.<br />\nN-L: How is Spring Fair shaping<br />\nup financially?<br />\nRich: It looks good. We've added a lot of food and arts &amp; crafts<br />\nvendors which gives us a lot more<br />\nstability. We're not counting on<br />\nbeer sales to float Fair financially. Rain or shine, Fair should<br />\nprovide enough money so that we<br />\ncan provide another quality Fair<br />\nnext year.<br />\nN-L: What types of arts &amp; crafts<br />\nand food vendors have you<br />\nsought to attract?<br />\nKelly: We sought to attract a<br />\nvariety of food vendors. With the<br />\narts &amp; crafts vendors, we've had<br /><br />\nan overwhelming response this<br />\nyear. We had something like over<br />\n270 applications for 150 spots, so<br />\nwe really sought to attract not only variety but quality and interesting things to this year's<br />\nFair. Hopefully, this year you<br />\nwon't be walking around and seeing jewelry,jewelry,jewelry, tiedye, jewelry, and an occasional<br />\nvendor.<br />\nRich: We try to have all our vendors be. . .true craftsmen. Plus,<br />\nwe have some artists this year,<br />\nwhich is new, that will be<br />\ndisplaying their works and some<br />\nwill be painting at the Fair.<br />\nKelly: In addition, we'll be having an expanded antique section<br />\nlocated on the midway. We're<br />\ntrying to increase the quality and<br />\nquantity of antiques represented<br />\nat Fair this year.<br />\nN-L: Any major unforseen problems or successes in preparation<br />\nfor Fair?<br />\nKelly: None more than<br />\nusual. . .There was a problem a<br />\nday, but that's to be expected.<br />\nRich: Considering the size of the<br />\norganization, Spring Fair actually<br />\nhad had surprisingly few major<br />\nproblems.<br />\nN-L: Is there anything you want<br />\nto say to the weatherman?<br />\nRich and Kelly: We would like<br />\nto refer the weatherman to our<br />\nlegal counsel.<br /><br />\nMiranda Act<br />\nContinued from page 4<br />\n\"The key works!\" he announced, tremendously pleased<br />\nwith himself. \"Let's move this<br />\nstuff in!\"<br />\nMiranda looked at the pile of<br />\nfurniture and counted.

His<br />\nopponent had a very aggressive<br />\nstyle of play and proved too tough<br />\nfor Missner.<br />\nKanu \"The Lord\" Jerath<br />\ndestroyed his Dickinson opponent<br />\n6-1, 6-3. Jerath has only one<br />\nsingles loss for the year. \"I was<br />\nquite pleased with this victory,<br />\nalthough a double bagel would<br />\nhave been nice.\"<br />\nBill Braude, playing number<br />\nfive singles, won 6-1, 7-5.<br />\nBraude outlasted a tough second<br />\nset to win the match. \"After my<br />\ndisappointing loss last week to<br />\nUrsinus, I was psyched to win<br /><br />\nthis one.\"<br />\nSam Kim, playing number six,<br />\nlost 6-4, 6-4. Recovering from a<br />\ngroin injury, Sam put up a good<br />\nfight. \"The icing on my groin<br />\nworked, although I was just a little bit off.\"<br />\nAfter the singles matches, the<br />\nteam score was three matches to<br />\nthree matches. However<br />\nHopkins' strength, the doubles,<br />\ncame through.<br />\nAt first doubles, Jon Missner<br />\nand Bill Braude lost a heartbreaker 7-5, 4-6, 7-5. It was their<br />\nfirst loss of the year and quite<br />\ndisappointing. \"I hope we still<br />\nhave \u2022a shot of being seeded at<br />\nMAC's,\" Braude said after the<br />\ntough loss.<br />\nSecond and third doubles won<br />\nrespectively, 6-3, 6-4, and 6-4,<br />\n6-4. Jerath and Francois Erasmus<br />\nplayed second doubles and Engquist and Mike Kim played third<br />\ndoubles.<br /><br />\nIf your business wants to<br />\nreach 5500 people every<br />\nweek, then advertise in<br />\nthe News-Letter.<br />\nCall us at 338-7647 for<br />\nour reasonable rates.<br /><br />\nWomen Lose Two<br />\nby Jessica Rosenbaum<br />\nThe women's tennis team suffered two losses in the past week<br />\nto pull their record down to three<br />\nwins and two losses. After beginning the season by dominating<br />\nthree matches, Hopkins fell to<br />\nDickinson 7-1 on Thursday,<br />\nApril 11.<br />\n\"Dickinson was an overall<br />\nstrong team. We also had a tough<br />\ntime adjusting to the weather. It<br />\nwas so windy that it was very difficult to judge how the tennis ball<br />\nwould move,\" commented Katie<br />\nStein, the number five player.<br />\nStein continued,\"We are back<br />\nto no-ad scoring and that often affects the score when we play<br />\ngood teams. In my match many<br />\nof the games were lost on deuce,<br />\nso this way of scoring definitely<br />\nhurt our team.\"<br />\nTamar Hausman, the number<br />\none player, was the only Hopkins<br />\ncompetitor to win her match. She<br />\nbeat her opponent decisively in<br />\ntwo quick sets.<br />\nAfter the singles competition,<br />\nHausman teamed with Dawn<br />\nStoner to play the number one<br />\ndoubles competition. This is their<br />\nsecond year playing together and<br />\nthey have a winning record this<br />\nseason.<br />\nAt the Dickinson match,<br />\nHausman explained, \"Dawn and<br />\nI usually play well together, but<br />\nwe also need to get psyched<br />\ntogether. Sometimes one of us<br /><br />\nwill have a long match and it's<br />\ndifficult to play another match<br />\nright after it.\"<br />\nHopkins was scheduled to play<br />\nElizabethtown on Saturday the<br />\n13th, but the game was rained<br />\n,out. This is the second match this<br />\nseason that has either been<br />\ncancelled or postponed.<br />\nThe weather was better on<br />\nTuesday the 16th, but the team<br />\nsuffered a devastating loss to<br />\nFranklin and Marshall. Not one<br />\nof the Hopkins competitors was<br />\nable to win a match, and they left<br />\nLancaster with a 0-9 loss.<br />\nHausman commented,\"I really should have beaten the girl I<br />\nplayed. This season I won a<br />\nmatch against someone who has<br />\nbeaten the Franklin and Marshall<br />\nplayer.<br />\n-was very good,<br />\nthough, and she knew just how to<br />\nplay me. She continually sliced to<br />\nthe backhand.\"<br />\nStoner also played well, but her<br />\ncompetitor was a \"pusher.\"<br />\nHausman elaborated, \"Pushers '<br />\nare difficult to beat because they<br />\nget to every ball, but they don't<br />\nthink about where to place their<br />\nreturn shot.\"<br />\nThe Franklin and Marshall<br />\nteam had added a lot of new<br />\nplayers to their roster and thus the<br />\nteam's methods of playing was<br />\nunfamiliar. Stein added,<br />\n\"Franklin and Marshall has a<br />\ngood team in almost every sport<br />\nand tennis is no exception.\"<br /><br />\nRejuvenated Crews<br />\nLook Toward LaSalle<br /><br />\nContinued from page 1.3<br />\nThe women's novice eight, facing a strong field which included<br />\nboats from Navy, Georgetown,<br />\nand Temple, failed to qualify for<br />\nthe finals, finishing seventh out<br />\nof twelve. The men's novice<br />\neight, rowing against powerful<br />\nheavyweights, also failed to'<br />\nqualify, falling in their heat to<br />\nboats from Navy, Drexel, and<br />\nGeorge Mason.<br />\n\"I think the first 1500 meters<br />\nof our race really didn't show<br />\nwhat our boat could do, but I<br />\nthink we settled down and<br />\nrowed really well in the last 500<br />\nmeters,\" said freshman Stephanie<br />\nFishkin, coxswain of the<br />\nwomen's novice eight.<br />\n\"Our crew did comparatively<br />\nwell,\" said Jesse Chu,freshman<br />\ncoxswain of the men's novice<br />\neight, \"especially considering<br />\nthat we were rowing against<br />\nheavyweights from very strong<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\n, Like the women's heavyweight<br />\nfour, the men's heavyweight four<br />\nwas struggling with an injury of<br />\nits own which forced the men's<br />\nfour to withdraw from last Saturday's race. Junior Eric Plautz<br />\ndeveloped back problems late in<br />\nthe week,and unlike the women's<br />\nfour which had notice of Ehringer's injury, the men's four was<br />\nunable to replace Plautz on such<br />\nshort notice. Plautz has been<br />\nrecovering this week and should<br />\nbe able to row this Saturday at the<br />\nLaSalle Invitational, which is<br />\ngood news for the men's four<br />\nwho will be facing such crews as<br />\nLaSalle, SUNY Maritime, and<br />\nVassar.<br />\n\"My back's a lot better, but it's<br />\nstill not 100 percent. The trainer<br />\nsaid it's something that will probably nag me, but shouldn't prevent me from rowing,.\" said<br /><br />\nPlautz.<br />\nLike Plautz, Ehringer is hoping to return to her boat this<br />\nweek. Ehringer has maintained<br />\nher strength and conditioning by<br />\nswimming and doing some back<br />\nexercises, but notes that returning after nearly a week and a half<br />\nwill not be automatic.<br />\n\"I feel out of touch with the<br />\nwater. Our boat has made some<br />\ntechnical adjustments since I've<br />\nbeen away, so I've got to come<br />\nback and make those adjustments,<br />\ntoo,\" said Ehringer.<br />\nOne of the adjustments the<br />\nwomen's four is trying to make<br />\nis to become more aggressive in<br />\ntheir stroke, as well as to return<br />\nto the more polished style they<br />\nexhibited earlier in the year. They<br />\nwill have a chance to do that this<br />\nSaturday when they row against<br />\nanother competitive field at<br />\nLaSalle, a field which, among<br />\nother boats, should include boats<br />\nfrom Carnegie Mellon, LaSalle,<br />\nand Lehigh.<br />\nLike the women's four, the<br />\nmen's lightweight is trying to<br />\nmake adjustments in its racing<br />\nstyle.<br />\n\"Right now, we usually try to<br />\nsprint out to an early lead, within<br />\nthe first 200 meters and then try<br />\nto sit on the other boats for the<br />\nrest of the race,\" said Porcarelli.<br />\n\"What we're going to try to do<br />\nis still start out strong, but not<br />\nthink we have to lead the whole<br />\nrace. We're going to try to ease<br />\ninto a sustained stroke and then<br />\nbuild on it every 500 meters or<br />\nso.\"<br />\nThe men's eight will have an<br />\nopportunity to test this new style<br />\nwhen they row at LaSalle against<br />\nsuch crews as LaSalle, Army,<br />\nMarist, and the University of<br />\nPennsylvania.<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Calendar<br />\n(4/19 - 4/25)<br />\nMen's Lacrosse<br />\nir<br /><br />\nSat.<br /><br />\n4/20<br /><br />\nL.S<br /><br />\nMaryland<br /><br />\n1:00 pm<br /><br />\nMU( j4S,1 4.111,11414<br /><br />\n4,;r,<br /><br />\nWomen's LaCtOSSQ Sat.<br /><br />\n4/20<br />\nThur. 4/25<br /><br />\nLynCh6urg\" ts\u2014<br />\nWidener<br /><br />\nBaseball<br /><br />\nFri.<br />\n4/19<br />\nSat. 4/20<br />\nTues. 4/23<br />\nWed. 4/24<br /><br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall 3:00 pm<br />\nHaverford (2) .<br />\n1:00 pm<br />\nElizabethtown<br />\n3:30 pm<br />\nGettysburg<br />\n3:30 pm<br /><br />\nMen's Tennis<br /><br />\nFri.<br /><br />\n4/19<br />\nMon. 4/2 2<br /><br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall<br />\nGettysburg<br /><br />\n3:00 pm<br />\n3:00 pm<br /><br />\nWomen's Tennis<br /><br />\nSat.<br />\n4/20<br />\nTues. 4/23<br />\nThu. 4/25<br /><br />\nGettysburg<br />\nCatholic<br />\nLoyola<br /><br />\n11:00 am<br />\n3:00 pm<br />\n3:00 pm<br /><br />\nTrack and Field<br /><br />\nSat.<br /><br />\nMessiah at Swarthmore<br /><br />\n12:00 pm<br /><br />\nLaSalle Invit.<br /><br />\nTBA<br /><br />\n4/20<br /><br />\nMen's and Women's Sat. 4/20<br />\nCrews<br /><br />\ni100 am<br />\n4:00 pm<br /><br />\nHome Games in Bold.<br /><br />\nSPRING TUNING<br /><br />\nNEED EXTRA INCOME<br />\nIlink FOR 1991?<br /><br />\nHave you been neglecting your piano?<br />\nGive your piano the seasonal care<br />\nit deserves!<br /><br />\nEarn $500 - $1000 weekly stuffing envelopes.
