If I were merely<br />\nupset about writing quality this<br />\nletter would be unnecessary, but<br />\nwhat concerns me is the lack of<br />\nfactual accuracy in a number of<br />\narticles.<br />\nThese inaccuracies<br />\ninclude those pointed out in<br />\nprevious letters such as Keith<br />\nJones' about the misunderstood<br />\ngrading proposal, the Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix debacle that resulted in a retraction, and Ted<br />\nHayes' informative and accurate<br />\ncorrection on Reaganomics. Perhaps the most glaring error was<br />\none I myself was involved in,<br />\n<br />\nThe Good Ole Days Depart<br />\nThis week, the first federal budget<br />\ncuts in funds for University research and<br />\nfor financial aid are going to go into effect.<br />\nAs Susan Broadbent, Hopkins' financial aid<br />\ndirector, has said, the cuts are the beginning of \"a new era\" in education.<br />\nThis is not another \"fight the Reagan<br />\ncuts\" opinion piece. Regardless of one's<br />\nviews on the cuts, many of them are now in<br />\neffect and will continue for a long time to<br />\ncome. For at least the present generation<br />\nof students then, what is important is a<br />\nrethinking of an overall attitude toward<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe past decade has been, for good<br />\nor ill, a period of unprecedented access to<br />\nand freedom of choice in higher education.<br />\nNot only was college a realistic possibility<br />\nfor a wide range of people, but a college<br />\neducation itself took on a variety of new<br />\nforms. Experimental curricula came to<br />\ninclude a broad range of peripherally<br />\nacademic subjects.<br />\nOne of the incidental consequences<br />\nof these developments was the more casual<br />\nand even apathetic attitude with which<br />\nmany people approached their college<br />\neducation. For many students, particularly<br />\nmiddle- and upper-middle class ones<br />\nattending liberal arts institutions college<br />\nhas become something to do simply because one has no idea what one would do<br />\notherwise. College can often be the sort of<br />\nprison that is simply too pleasant for one<br />\nto think of trying to escape from, and the<br />\nresult is that one can spend four pleasant<br />\nyears with little in the way of growth and<br />\nself-challenge. College, at its most enjoyable worst, can be a reprieve from adulthood that ends in abject terror just around<br />\ngraduation time.<br />\nBut the period of largesse in education has left a valuable legacy, too. Tolerant outlooks and an experimental spirit<br />\nhave encouraged many students to explore<br />\ntheir interests more thoroughly, even to the<br />\npoint of taking time off from school or<br />\nleaving school all together. Doors were<br />\nopened up for people who might either<br />\nhave been unable to afford or unable to<br />\ntake an interest in academics under the<br />\nmore traditional system.<br />\nWhat is important now is that while<br />\nwe are being forced, for economic reasons,<br />\nto learn from the flaws of what are already<br />\n\"the good old days,\" we don't lose sight of<br />\ntheir good points. Students in this new era<br />\nare going to find it ever more important to<br />\n<br />\nknow why they are in college. That's<br />\nnot to say that we should all go the preprofessional route, but for those of us who<br />\nare here simply for learning's sake, learning<br />\nshould become a more serious commitment. It's hard to be serious when you're<br />\n18, have a girlfriend or boyfriend, and are<br />\nliving away from home for the first time,<br />\nand maybe this should be a real consideration when it comes time to apply to<br />\nschools. In many ways, a liberal arts<br />\neducation is more ideally suited to someone who is 65 years old: one needs to be in<br />\na contemplative mood to read Dante, and<br />\none also needs to have had other experiences which make one appreciate the<br />\nDante.<br />\nto<br />\nread<br />\nopportunity<br />\nThis week, the Student Council<br />\nEducation Committee has proposed an<br />\ninvestigation into the faculty-student<br />\nadvising program. A survey, taken two and<br />\na half years ago, indicates that many<br />\nstudents are dissatisfied with the program<br />\nand that many professors do not take their<br />\nadvging obligation very seriously. Here is at<br />\nleast one specific area where changes,<br />\nappropriate for this \"new era in education,\"<br />\ncould take place. Advisors should first of<br />\nall be impressed with the importance of<br />\ntheir responsibility. They should work<br />\nclosely with both the Career Advising<br />\nOffice and the Office of Advising and<br />\nCounseling to devise a specific program,<br />\nwhich would include a certain number of<br />\nregular meetings. Advisors, even those who<br />\nlack great interpersonal skills, could be<br />\nrequired to talk to students about career<br />\nand educational goals, summer job plans,<br />\nand related interests. Specific steps such as<br />\nthese might eliminate the 'nothing to talk<br />\nabout' void that both students and faculty<br />\ncomplain about.<br />\nOf course, with Hopkins' we don't<br />\nbaby-sit you' philosophy, it may be unreasonable to expect faculty members to<br />\ntake on these additional responsibilities.<br />\nPerhaps the Office of Advising and Counseling could develop a larger staff and<br />\nperform these functions\u2014with its present<br />\nnumber of personnel, already on overload,<br />\nthis would be impossible.<br />\nThe point is that college is getting to<br />\nbe too expensive an experience to let slip<br />\naway. It is often the student who is at fault<br />\nfor . not seeking advice, but people who<br />\nneed help don't always ask for it. People<br />\nwho don't can't suffer from the opportunity.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\n<br />\nor at least my by-line was.

I<br />\nof the National Enquirer, strongly disagree with managecont. on p. 5<br />\nment's feelings that community<br />\n<br />\nmembers are a necessity to the so; for one only has to look at<br />\n<br />\nsuccess of WJHU. It would seem the ever increasing number of<br />\nunlikely that such a station<br />\nwould be unable to attract<br />\nenough students (from Hopkins)<br />\nto fill its ranks.<br />\nWhat has really happened is<br />\nthat a few community and<br />\nHopkins members now possess<br />\nsuch a controlling influence over<br />\nthe station's operations that the<br />\noverall atmosphere of WJHU can<br />\nonly be described as a cliquish,<br />\ntightknit social club. Dm sure in<br />\nthe coming weeks we will hear<br />\nmore about this tragic saga of<br />\nthese misinformed, mismanaged<br />\nbunch of basement dormdwellers.<br />\n.<br />\nIf for any reason the WJHU<br />\nmanagement disagrees with any<br />\nof the above points, let them do<br />\n<br />\nex-WJHU members among us to<br />\nsee what is really happening.<br />\nRobert Insoft<br />\n<br />\nResearch Rip-Off<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe September 8 issue of<br />\nScience contains a letter in<br />\nwhich a professor retracts a<br />\nnumber of papers and presentations due to errors in the work<br />\nof one of his graduate students.<br />\nThe professor's grant is being<br />\n\"reevaluated\"; the student has<br />\nwithdrawn from the university.<br />\nThe initial response of many<br />\nmight be to condemn the<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nMore Letters: Are Profs Pre-empting P.hDs?<br />\n<br />\ncont.from p. 4<br />\ngraduate student for incompetence, overzealousness, or even<br />\nfaking the data \u2014 all situations<br />\nAnd yet,<br />\nof real concern.<br />\nprofessor.s<br />\nthe<br />\nconsidering<br />\nplight, I cannot help but wonder<br />\nwhether he is the inadvertent<br />\nvictim of a practice which, in<br />\nother instances, might leave little<br />\nroom for sympathy.<br />\nThis response assumes a<br />\nparticular scenario, yet one<br />\nwhich seems all too common. In<br />\nbut a few weeks at Hopkins, I<br />\nhave heard various horror stories<br />\nof, quite simply, paper stealing.<br />\nThe practice is hardly new: a<br />\nprofessor incorporates a student's work into his own paper,<br />\nor adds his name to the credits \u2014<br />\nalmost always first.<br />\nThe social dynamics inherent in this practice are well<br />\nknown: the pressure to publish,<br />\nthe notion that an \"established\"<br />\nname will facilitate acceptance,<br />\nor even the recognition that<br />\nvarious grant agencies require a<br />\nstudent to submit a:- project under<br />\n<br />\nthe professor's name. When the<br />\nstudent is merely playing the<br />\nrole of researcher, or otherwise<br />\ndrawing substantially on the<br />\nresources and prior work of the<br />\nprofessor, dual \u2014 or even a<br />\nprofessorial claim of authorship<br />\nwould seem appropriate. But<br />\nthe practice of \"signing on\"<br />\nseems to extend beyond these<br />\nsituations to work for which the<br />\nprofessor has little or no substantial claim.<br />\nAll of the cases I have heard<br />\nhave been presented with a<br />\ncombined sense of outrage and<br />\nfrustration. To refuse, let alone<br />\ncomplain, is to jeopardize one's<br />\nprogress toward the degree.<br />\nAnd so student after student<br />\nbuckles under to \"the system.\"<br />\nNothing changes. And each new<br />\ngeneration confronts the same<br />\nsituation. While it is not always<br />\neasy to identify a participant's<br />\ntrue contribution in individual<br />\ncases, a very real ethical dilemma<br />\nseems to persist.<br />\nNo easy solution seems in<br />\n<br />\nA Reply<br />\nGeorge Yatchisin's resignation from the News-Letter news<br />\nstaff, in response to last week's editorial regarding WJHU,concerns<br />\nus on only one count. Yatchisin asks how the News-Letter can<br />\nattack WJHU for giving shows to non-students when we have some<br />\ncontributors who are nonstudents. The answer is that the N-L's<br />\nnon-student contributors, unlike WJHUs, do not take<br />\naway<br />\nopportunities from those who are students. The non-students do<br />\nnot hold editorial positions and cannot vote in N-L elections and<br />\npolicy decisions. This week, to avoid confusion on this matter, the<br />\nnames of all non-student contributors have been removed from the<br />\nstaff-box.<br />\n<br />\nYatchisin's Resignation<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nparticularly because it worked<br />\nthrough innuendos. 'Not explaining why Caplan resigned<br />\nmade it seem that it was due to<br />\npressure because of your article.<br />\nBy the way, your editorial<br />\nsuggestion of bringing back the<br />\nAM station would make listening<br />\nto demos nearly impossible, as<br />\nthe old AM studio is now the<br />\nproduction studio where precious time may be booked to<br />\nlisten to demos. (Just another<br />\ncase of coming up with a solution that ignores the facts.)<br />\nStephanie Reynold's article<br />\nis for the most part accurate<br />\nbeyond the above complaints,<br />\nbut somehow the notion of facts<br />\nsupporting an editorial has slipped Joe Levine. First, your line<br />\nabout outside personnel consisting of \"high school kids to<br />\n35-year-old unemployed professionals,\" contains one major<br />\nflaw \u2014 the use of plurals. The<br />\nextremes do not an average<br />\nmake.<br />\nAnd if community<br />\nmembers seem so threatening,<br />\nwhy do the now graduated Cliff<br />\nHarris and Lindsay Kaplan still<br />\nplay active roles in the N-L?<br />\nProbably to make the paper a<br />\nlittle better. Well, what's good<br />\nfor your paper should be good<br />\nfor WJHU,too.<br />\nAlso an FCC license does<br />\nnot create \"an obligation to its<br />\nlisteners\" for WJHU. It does<br />\ncreate an obligation to the<br />\ngovernment, i.e. WJHU can<br />\nbreak laws if they are not<br />\ncareful. Since the only real law<br />\nthe News-Letter can break is<br />\nthat of libel (which you seem<br />\nnot too worried about while<br />\n<br />\nhinting of \"intentional exclusionary tactics\" and \"just plain<br />\nincompetence\"), I don't think<br />\nthe paper has any right to<br />\ncriticize a desire for professionalism as it may just keep the U.S.<br />\ngovernment happy.<br />\nBy the way, I'm an undergraduate student at Hopkins and<br />\ngot a show on WJHU beginning<br />\nthis summer. There is no need<br />\nfor the station to advertise for<br />\nDJ's; people who are really<br />\ninterested will come to them, if<br />\nthey have any motivation or true<br />\ndesire at all.<br />\nTo wrap this all too cumbersome letter up, I do want to<br />\nadd that I would like to remain<br />\nwriting Arts for the News-Letter.<br />\nThe reasons here are simple: it<br />\nis the only competent section of<br />\nthe paper, and it is where<br />\nopinions belong (although even<br />\nreviewers should listen to albums<br />\nfirst).<br />\n<br />\nsight. Any review committee, it<br />\nis generally felt, would be<br />\nsubject to the same pressures.<br />\nYet, I am convinced, something<br />\nmust be done.<br />\nIn this effort, I would<br />\nappreciate hearing from anyone<br />\n\u2014 graduate student or professor<br />\n\u2014 interested in offering information on this matter, including an<br />\nassessment of the prevalence of<br />\nsuch practices, and would welcome suggestions for addressing<br />\nthe problem should it deserve<br />\nattention.<br />\nAll names and<br />\ninformation will remain strictly<br />\nconfidential.<br />\nDaniel J.

Allow<br />\nme to venture a few statistics. I<br />\ncurrently have an on-the-air staff<br />\nof 16 DJ's filling 15 slots.<br />\nFifteen of these students are<br />\nfull-time students at Hopkins, 1<br />\nis a full-time Goucher student. I<br />\nam in the process of training two<br />\nmore Hopkins and one more<br />\nGoucher student. In addition, I<br />\nhave an auxiliary 'back up' staff<br />\nof about five people, one of<br />\nwhom is a University employee,<br />\nand one of whom is a student at<br />\nPeabody. So much for figures.<br />\nAt the beginning of Orientation, I personally stuffed the<br />\nmailboxes of all incoming fresh-<br />\n<br />\nmen in order to attract DJ's. I<br />\nreceived about eight responses<br />\nout of the entire freshman class.<br />\nSeven of these are on the air,<br />\nand one is in training. I have<br />\nhad to beg some students to join<br />\nand become DJ's on numerous<br />\noccasions, and was even forced<br />\nto fill almost one third of the<br />\ntotal classical music programming time myself at several points.<br />\nI would also like to point out<br />\nthat staff peronnel are not<br />\n'hired,' they volunteer their<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\ntime, myself included.<br />\ndrawbacks to such a system<br />\nought to be obvious.

From this<br />\nbody, the Executive Board is<br />\nelected. The primary duties of<br />\nthis group are to review and<br />\nestablish budgets for most of the<br />\nstudent activities and clubs on<br />\ncampus. (Clubs that are not<br />\nmembers of the SAC do not fall<br />\nunder their jurisdiction.)

I<br />\nam looking forward to overseeing the new groups and<br />\nhelping them with their special<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nAlthough Heim has no particular desire to implement<br />\nchanges this year, she agrees<br />\nwith Lally in hoping \"to see<br />\nthings work better.

Nicaragua<br />\nalso has a huge foreign debt,<br />\npartially inherited from the<br />\nSomoza regime. Western and<br />\ndomestic investors have been<br />\npulling their capital out in<br />\nresponse to what they see as a<br />\nbleak future for private investment. Daniel Ortega Saadveara,<br />\nchief of the Sandinista junta,<br />\nhas said with considerable understatement that \"the situation of<br />\nthe country is not normal.\" His<br />\ngovernment has reacted by raising import taxes and adopting<br />\nausterity measures which involve<br />\na five percent cut in the budget<br />\nand a 10 percent cut in subsidized food and public services.<br />\nThomas Enders, the American State Department official in<br />\ncharge of Latin American affairs,<br />\nvisited Nicaragua in mid-August<br />\nto hold discussions with the<br />\nSandinista Directorate. Since<br />\nthe cutoff of U.S. aid over arms<br />\nshipments to El Salvador, U.S.-<br />\n<br />\nNicaragua relations have been<br />\ndeteriorating. At issue are the<br />\nSandinistas' questionably democratic and potentially antiWestern domestic and foreign<br />\npolicies. On the foreign front,<br />\nthe U.S. is displeased with the<br />\nsubstantial presence of Cuban<br />\nand Eastern European military<br />\nadvisers, technicians, and social<br />\nworkers. The buildup of the<br />\nNicaraguan army, already the<br />\nlargest in Central American with<br />\n22,000 men, alarms many. The<br />\nSandinistas wish to establish an<br />\narmy of 50,000 men. The<br />\nDirectorate has also been lengthening the airstrip outside of<br />\nPuerto Cabezas to the point<br />\nwhere anything that presently<br />\nflies can land there. The Sandinista Directorate portrays this<br />\nbuildup as a measure to protect<br />\nitself from the conservative<br />\nCentral American governments<br />\nto the North, and from the<br />\nU.S. This argument does not<br />\nhold much water as the armies in<br />\nEl Salvador and Guatemala are<br />\n<br />\nfully occupied with the guerilla<br />\ninsurrections in their respective<br />\ncountries.<br />\nThe U.S. is not<br />\nlikely to do much in Nicaragua<br />\nas several vocal segments of the<br />\nU.S. population decry even<br />\nlimited U.S. assistance to El<br />\nSalvador. The Nicaraguans' fear<br />\nof U.S. intervention has its roots<br />\nin the fact that U.S. marines<br />\noccupied Nicaragua for over a<br />\ndecade.<br />\nDomestically, the seriousness of the Sandinistas' commitment to democratic pluralism<br />\ncan easily be questioned.

It was late Saturday night, I wasn't tired, and<br />\nI'd heard that the Mighty Invaders and Determination<br />\nwere playing at the \"Arena\" on Paca Street. I'd never<br />\nheard of the place, and haven't since, but that night I<br />\ndrove downtown and walked fearlessly into the Arena.<br />\nIt wasn't a bar, nor a concert hall, but something of an<br />\nabandoned warehouse. The inside was almost totally<br />\ndark, with the exception of a handful of blue lights<br />\nwhich were diffused into a cloud of smoke. Never had I<br />\nseen so many ganji splifs (marijuana cigarettes) bobbing<br />\nlike fireflies in the darkness. The band was hammering<br />\nout a beat which could totally absorb you, make your<br />\nself-consciousness vanish into the music. But nonetheless I was self-conscious. I was the only white person<br />\nthere, and I was dressed conspicuously casually in blue<br />\njeans. The rest of the crowd was dressed as if for<br />\nchurch; the men in white shirts with black vests, sometimes wearing rounded tophats or felt caps, and the<br />\nwomen in sun dresses. They spoke in a heavy West<br />\nIndian accent which I could barely understand. Along<br />\nthe cinderblock walls tables were set up where you could<br />\nbuy rice and some sort of stew which I think they said<br />\nwas muskrat. No one seemed to mind that I was there,<br />\nbut nevertheless I felt as if I were intruding. It was only<br />\nafter a short, lively fellow greeted me, told me to feel<br />\nwelcome, and shared his splif with me that I began to<br />\nfeel very comfortable. Soon I too got up to dance in<br />\nfront of the band. It puzzled me that most people stood<br />\nin the darkness of the back, dancing alone in their own<br />\nareas. I began to suspect there was more to reggae than<br />\njust dancing.<br />\nThe lyrics always puzzled me. Who is this \"Jah\"<br />\nfellow, and who are \"I and I,\" and what's a \"crazy bald<br />\nhead,\" or a \"Rastaman\"? Determined to discover the<br />\ninner truths of reggae, I arranged an interview with<br />\nStetford (\"King\") Clark, the leader and bass guitarist of<br />\nthe Mighty Invaders. In the basement of a rowhouse<br />\nbehind Pimlico Race Track, King Clark gave me the<br />\nlowdown in his heavy Jamaican accent:<br />\nN-L: What religion are most reggae performers?<br />\nTony: Rastafarian.<br />\n<br />\n'(We want) a world<br />\nwhere there's peace,<br />\nlove, and unity, with<br />\nequal rights and justice.'<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, so reggae dances have become religious<br />\nmeeting places rather than just informal entertainment.<br />\nUnlike many religious groups, the Rastas believe<br />\nin taking some sort of positive action towards making<br />\nthe world a better place. In the words of international<br />\nreggae star Peter Tosh, \"You've got to get up, stand up,<br />\nstand up for your rights.\" This immediately made<br />\nme wonder where they stood in the political arena.<br />\nN-L: What sort of world are the Rastafarians hoping to<br />\ncreate?<br />\nTony: A world where there's peace, love, and unity,<br />\nwith equal rights and justice.<br />\nN-L: What do you mean by peace, love, and unity?<br />\nTony: No fighting, no stealing, no prejudice. I mean,if<br />\na man is white or black, they both bleed red blood. Just<br />\nlike if a dog is black or white, it don't make no difference<br />\nN-L: Why do you think people steal?<br />\nTony: Well, like when me and my brothers come here<br />\nfrom Jamaica, if we didn't make music, we would have<br />\nno jobs. I go in and I ask for a job, and the man says<br />\n\"Take off your hat.\" He sees my hair all knotted up and<br />\nhe says \"you can't have a job with your hair like that.\"<br />\nI tell him this is the way my hair naturally is, so I don't<br />\ncut it, but I don't have a job either. I was an apprentice<br />\nto a bricklayer when I first came here, but I said \"fuck<br />\nthat shit.\" So what do you do? Some brothers will take<br />\nout a knife and go steal something, and I can understand<br />\nthat because we all got to eat. But there's a lot of bad<br />\nmen, \"evil-doers.\" We call them \"Dreadlocks,\" and they<br />\ngo out and kill and steal. Killing is wrong, man, because<br />\nonce you're dead you're never coming back. When I say<br />\n\"Dreadlocks\" I don't mean that they wear their hair in<br />\ndreadloacks, though some do because they think it's<br />\ngoing to scare people. Some of them may have shaved<br />\ntheir heads.<br />\nBut they're not Rastafarians.<br />\nN-L: Are the \"Dreadlocks\" also Jamaicans?<br />\nTony: They're from all over, man.<br />\nFrom experiences I'd had with the Rastafarians,<br />\nand from what Tony Clark told me, I was convinced that<br />\nthe Rastas were dedicated to ridding the world of racial<br />\nprejudice. But because they are a religious group, I had<br />\nmy suspicions about subtler forms of prejudice.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of other religious groups, even<br />\nnon-Christians?<br />\nTony: We're all worshipping the same thing. If a man<br />\ncomes up to you and tells you he worships his dog as<br />\nGod, you go \"okay,\" and you may think he's crazy, but<br />\nto him that dog is God. The Bible says God manifests<br />\nhimself in many forms.<br />\nN-L: Do you think women deserve equal rights and<br />\njustice?<br />\nTony: Women are women, and men are men, and in<br />\nsome ways women are weaker than men. But I think<br />\nthey should have equal rights and justice, sure, sure.<br />\nN-L: Would most Rastafarians agree with you on that<br />\naccount?<br />\nTony: If you had eight Rastafarians, you'd get eight<br />\ndifferent answers.<br />\nN-L: What about homosexuals? Do you think they<br />\ndeserve equal rights and justice.<br />\nTony: Pshew, that stuff is crazy. It's Babylon, man.<br />\nMichelle and Stanley Cole (keyboards, percussion<br />\nand backup vocals) showed up, and occasionally Stanley<br />\njoined in the conversation. All seemed to object to<br />\nhomosexuality, mostly because the bible objects to it.<br />\nWhen the group spoke among themselves, they<br />\nsounded very different than they did when talking<br />\nto me. When I asked them what language they were<br />\nspeaking, Stanley said, laughing, \"That's English, man.<br />\nYou just don't recognize the way we slur our words.\"<br />\nI was still unclear about where the Rastas stood<br />\npolitically and further questioning produced no conclusive answer to this question.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Where would you place Rastafarians on the<br />\npolitical spectrum, to the right or to the left?<br />\nN-L: Is that a Christian religion?<br />\nTony:<br />\nWell, you know, when a man doesn't have a job,<br />\nChristian.<br />\nof<br />\nTony: Yes, we're Christians, our own kind<br />\nand can't get the money to feed his family and himself,<br />\nEventually I learned what he meant. Rastamen he has to do something.<br />\nbelieve basically that Haile Selassie,(the late emperor of<br />\nEthiopia) is a messiah, like Christ. They also call him N-L: What do you think should be done about unemand God \"Jah\" from the word Jahova, or the ployment?<br />\n\"Selasieai.\" The word Rastafarian comes from Selassie's Tony: I don't want to answer that now because it's a<br />\nname before he became emperor; Ras Tafari. Like many difficult problem,a very difficult problem. But the guys<br />\nChristians, they believe that Jah \"walks before them,\" with all the money, if they'd build apartment buildings<br />\nprotecting them from harm, and that eventually Jah will or put their money into the community and create jobs,<br />\nhelp his people reunite. Rationally enough, they believe rather than spending it on themselves...I don't know.<br />\nthat Africa is the homeland, the cradle of civilization.<br />\nThey don't eat pork, they avoid alcohol, coffee, and tea, N-L: Do you think it's unfair that some people are very<br />\nand they smoke marijuana religiously \"for inspiration.\". wealthy and others are very poor?<br />\nLike many religious groups they believe much of the real Tony: I don't care who's rich and who's poor. What's<br />\nworld, particularly in the U.S., is wicked, and have thus important is that people love each other and care about<br />\ndubbed it \"Babylon.\" There is no Rastafarian church in each other. But I don't think those rich men are really<br />\n<br />\n\fMempers of The Mighty Invaders: Tony, Michelle, Stanley<br />\nthinking about the man in the ghetto. They don't even Tony: It's mostly West Baltimore. We met at parties<br />\nknow what it's like to live there.<br />\nand cabaret shows, or other social gatherings. Then<br />\nThree Speed (Trever Hibbert, rhythm guitarist) had the<br />\nWe began talking about Reagan and his budget idea of starting a band.

Now who do you think's going to benefit from ago they picked up their manager David Katz, who's<br />\n\"helped a lot.\" Now 10 people are living off the band's<br />\nhis budget cuts?<br />\nTony: Well, as far as Social Security, most people don't income.<br />\neven make it to over 65, so I don't know where that<br />\nN-L: Why did you leave Jamaica?<br />\nmoney's going.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of other political groups, like Tony: I liked to travel. I'd heard a lot about the U.S.<br />\nfrom people and I wanted to see it; also my mother lived<br />\nthe socialists, Marxists, etc.?<br />\nTony: Most of them are evildoers, very bad men. in Baltimore.<br />\nN-L: Would you say the situation is better here than in<br />\nViolence is very bad.<br />\nN-L: What did you think of the Solidarity Day march Jamaica?<br />\nTony: (with Michelle and Stanley concurring) No.<br />\non Washington? Did you support that?<br />\nStanley: Well now there are some people who have real Discrimination is not so bad there. In Jamaica, if you're<br />\nneeds and are standing up for their rights. Sure I sup- prejudiced, you'd better keep it to yourself. There's no<br />\nKlu Klux Klan like there is here. Here, if a cop sees me<br />\nport them.<br />\nN-L: How do you think we should got about bringing driving down the road and he sees my hair, he'll pull<br />\nme over because he thinks I have this. (He points to his<br />\npeace, love and unity to the world?<br />\nTony: Jesus gives us all our own way. To us he's given splif.) Then he'd take it and the minute anyone's back is<br />\nthe chance to sing out our message. Some people go to turned he'd go and smoke it himself. It's Babylon, man.<br />\nchurch...When people come to hear reggae music, some There's so much stealing and violence and prostitution,<br />\npeople just get into the sound and lose themselves in the and Sodomy \u2014 you know what happened to Sodom \u2014<br />\nbeat, then they go home and go to sleep, which is all and what you call dikes.

In Jamaica we've got no welfare, no<br />\ntheir lyrics, so Stanley recited some the band had Social Security, yet nobody's walking around with a<br />\nswollen belly because in Jamaica the weather is tropical,<br />\nwritten.<br />\nand everybody can grow food for themselves like yams<br />\nFreedom,freedom fighter,<br />\nand such if they have no job, and if they have no house,<br />\nI want to be a freedom fighter,<br />\nis no winter, so the worst thing they will have to<br />\nthere<br />\nI want to free the poor,<br />\nthe rain, and most people can find shelter in an<br />\nis<br />\nbear<br />\nSo they suffer no more<br />\nabandoned car or something. Here people need a little<br />\nI want to free the hungry,<br />\nsomething to get by.<br />\nSo that they starve no more.<br />\nN-L: Are the members of the Determination Band also<br />\nmembers of the Jamaican community, and are your two<br />\ngroups affiliated in any way?<br />\nTony: We're just friends. They live down the street.<br />\nThey've been together a lot longer than we have, but<br />\nnow we've got a lot more (engagements) than they do.<br />\nI prepared to ask a very touchy question.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n4\u201e<br />\n3,<br />\n&<br />\n4<br />\n,:<br />\n*44<br />\n. ar\u2018l.\"\"** II,<br />\n<br />\n,,...0474\u201e<br />\n.4<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\n\u201eAO*<br />\n<br />\n\u201e0.,<br />\n<br />\n,...<br />\n<br />\nNow I said to myself, \"These lyrics ring of<br />\nrevolution. They're fighting words.\" But so far all I<br />\ncould tell was that they planned to sing the world's blues<br />\naway. Bob Marley's songs often speak of winning the<br />\nfight in South Africa, which would imply that some<br />\nRastas believe a more active role in changing the world is<br />\nnecessary. I was still missing a few key concepts, such<br />\nas what they meant by \"Unity,\" and who \"I and I\" is. I<br />\nthought I'd start with the microcosm and move to the<br />\nmacrocosm, by asking about the band's unity first.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: What do you think other Baltimore blacks think of<br />\nthe Jamaican community?<br />\nTony: They don't accept us. They think we're different<br />\nfrom them. It's because they don't know their roots.<br />\nThey're not different from us; we are all from Africa.<br />\nBaltimore blacks, they're all fucked up. They're all<br />\ndown in the dumps and they won't pick themselves up<br />\nand stand up or their rights. They don't want to do<br />\nanything about their troubles until they're backed up<br />\nagainst the wall. They accuse us of taking away their<br />\njobs. They don't realize that we have to unify and face<br />\nthe problem (of no jobs) together. It's pitiful, but<br />\nsometimes I think the whites are less likely to screw us<br />\nthan American blacks.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Do you think that reggae is catching on with<br />\nBaltimore blacks?<br />\nTony: Eighty percent of our audience is white. If we<br />\nwere to rely on American blacks to support us we'd be<br />\nstarving. We played at Coppin State (a black college)<br />\nN-L: Are all the band members originally from Jamaica? and the people in the audience won't dance; they won't<br />\nStanley: All but Yvonne Deane, who says she's from even show us they appreciate our music.

N-L: Do you think reggae will ever catch on among<br />\nN-L: Where is that?<br />\nAmerican blacks?<br />\n<br />\nTony: I -don't know,I think so. I hope so.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of the American civil rights<br />\nmovement, and men like Martin Luther King?<br />\nTony: Martin Luther King was a good man, and a wise<br />\nman, a very wise_ man. But that's American history. I'm<br />\nnot so concerned with American history as African<br />\nhistory. That's where the roots are.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of other types of music?<br />\nTony: I like all music, rock like the Rolling Stones, but<br />\nI choose reggae.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of punk?<br />\nTony: You mean punk rock? They're like fags, aren't<br />\nthey? They're not out to help anyone.<br />\nN-L: Where do you like to perform?<br />\nTony: I like to play in Baltimore and Baltimore is my<br />\ncity.<br />\nN-L: Where do you like to play in Baltimore? What<br />\nbars?<br />\nTony: Not so much in bars. I like to play where the<br />\npeople really get into it. That gets the band fired up. I<br />\nlike to play at the colleges, like Johns Hopkins, Goucher,<br />\nLoyola. There the people really get into the music.<br />\nN-L: Are you cutting an album?<br />\nTony: Yes, we plan to this fall. There are no international reggae bands from the U.S. yet, certainly not in<br />\nBaltimore, so the market is open. The problem is,<br />\neverybody is afraid to give us the money. They don't<br />\nknow if reggae can sell.<br />\nN-L: One last question. Who is \"I and I\"?<br />\nTony: That means like you and me, man. Everybody.<br />\n<br />\n4 ... there are some people<br />\nwho have real needs and<br />\nare standing up for their<br />\nrights...I support them.'<br />\n<br />\nI think that was the key to the Rastafarians'<br />\nmessage. I don't know what to think of their politics. It<br />\nseems based not on any system or any particular view of<br />\nthe economy, but simply a sincere desire to improve<br />\npeople's lives. They also seem dedicated to living by<br />\nChristian morals. They seem to lack a concrete notion<br />\nof how to bring about social change, and disagree<br />\nsomewhat among themselves as to what social change is<br />\nappropriate and how to bring it about. This confusion<br />\nstems from a somewhat naive view of the causes of<br />\nproblems such as unemployment, pointing their finger at<br />\n\"evildoers\" and avaricious rich, rather than at problems<br />\ninherent in the social structure. Living by Christian<br />\nmorality, many would argue, would deprive homosexuals and women of equal rights and justice. Nonetheless, political activists from both sides of the spectrum<br />\nfind something about the Rastas' message appealing.<br />\nThe idea of \"unity,\" that all men and women of all races<br />\nand religions should think of themselves as caught in the<br />\nsame wicked world, with the same basic problems to<br />\nsolve, is a beautiful one. Perhaps merely singing and<br />\nthus in some way convincing everyone in the world to<br />\ntreat everyone else as if they were brothers or sisters<br />\nwould go a long way to solve some of the world's<br />\nproblems. And the idea of \"unity\" seems particularly<br />\nrelevant to American blacks who share the pains of<br />\ndiscrimination with the Rastafarians, yet apparently are<br />\nresisting the uniting of their causes.<br />\nRolling Stone magazine called reggae perhaps the<br />\nmost danceable music ever. I believe them.

And why, given how it<br />\nturned out, did it do such spectacular<br />\nbusiness? I could go on about artistic<br />\nintegrity and public taste, about the<br />\ncontinuous struggle between the people<br />\nwho want to make good movies and the<br />\npeople who simply want to make money,<br />\nbut I won't.

And so many owners<br />\nare choosing what they feel is<br />\nthe one alternative left them:<br />\ncondominium conversion.<br />\nUntil recently, Baltimore<br />\nhas been relatively untouched by<br />\nthe wave of conversions that has<br />\nalready swept other cities such<br />\nas Washington, Philadelphia, and<br />\nNew York. In the words of<br />\nDea Kline, of the University's<br />\nOffice of Community Affairs,<br />\n\"Baltimore has not been in the<br />\nforeground\" of the condominium movement. Exactly why<br />\nBaltimore has taken so long to<br />\ncatch up to the rest of the<br />\nnation, or at least most other<br />\nEast-coast cities, is unclear. But<br /><br />\nthe recent rash of development<br />\ncan be traced to three major<br />\neconomic stresses<br />\nsources:<br />\nwhich may make apartments less<br />\nprofitable and condos more so, a<br />\nnew state law, and a company<br />\ncalled American Invsco \u2014 a<br />\nChicago-based firm which was<br />\none of the first large nationwide<br />\ncondo companies to operate in<br />\nBaltimore, thus helping to trigger the recent \"condo craze\"<br />\nhere.<br />\nThe state's contribution to<br />\nthe problem was the enactment<br />\nof a new law, on June 31 of this<br />\nyear, that was intended to help<br />\nthe elderly and low-income<br />\nrenters. The law stated that if<br /><br />\nthe owners converted, they<br />\nwould have to extend the leases<br />\nof fifteen percent of their<br />\nelderly renters for three years,<br />\nand also pay moving costs up to<br />\n750 dollars to any elderly<br />\nperson. Any owner who notified his tenants of intent to<br />\nconvert before the June 31<br />\ndeadline, however, was unaffected by the new strictures. As a<br />\nresult, many building owners<br />\ngave notice to their tenants<br />\nwhether or not they were<br />\nseriously considering conversion.<br />\nThe Northway has done this; the<br />\nWarrington is now in the process<br />\nof conversion.

If I were merely<br />\nupset about writing quality this<br />\nletter would be unnecessary, but<br />\nwhat concerns me is the lack of<br />\nfactual accuracy in a number of<br />\narticles.<br />\nThese inaccuracies<br />\ninclude those pointed out in<br />\nprevious letters such as Keith<br />\nJones' about the misunderstood<br />\ngrading proposal, the Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix debacle that resulted in a retraction, and Ted<br />\nHayes' informative and accurate<br />\ncorrection on Reaganomics. Perhaps the most glaring error was<br />\none I myself was involved in,<br /><br />\nThe Good Ole Days Depart<br />\nThis week, the first federal budget<br />\ncuts in funds for University research and<br />\nfor financial aid are going to go into effect.<br />\nAs Susan Broadbent, Hopkins' financial aid<br />\ndirector, has said, the cuts are the beginning of \"a new era\" in education.<br />\nThis is not another \"fight the Reagan<br />\ncuts\" opinion piece. Regardless of one's<br />\nviews on the cuts, many of them are now in<br />\neffect and will continue for a long time to<br />\ncome. For at least the present generation<br />\nof students then, what is important is a<br />\nrethinking of an overall attitude toward<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe past decade has been, for good<br />\nor ill, a period of unprecedented access to<br />\nand freedom of choice in higher education.<br />\nNot only was college a realistic possibility<br />\nfor a wide range of people, but a college<br />\neducation itself took on a variety of new<br />\nforms. Experimental curricula came to<br />\ninclude a broad range of peripherally<br />\nacademic subjects.<br />\nOne of the incidental consequences<br />\nof these developments was the more casual<br />\nand even apathetic attitude with which<br />\nmany people approached their college<br />\neducation. For many students, particularly<br />\nmiddle- and upper-middle class ones<br />\nattending liberal arts institutions college<br />\nhas become something to do simply because one has no idea what one would do<br />\notherwise. College can often be the sort of<br />\nprison that is simply too pleasant for one<br />\nto think of trying to escape from, and the<br />\nresult is that one can spend four pleasant<br />\nyears with little in the way of growth and<br />\nself-challenge. College, at its most enjoyable worst, can be a reprieve from adulthood that ends in abject terror just around<br />\ngraduation time.<br />\nBut the period of largesse in education has left a valuable legacy, too. Tolerant outlooks and an experimental spirit<br />\nhave encouraged many students to explore<br />\ntheir interests more thoroughly, even to the<br />\npoint of taking time off from school or<br />\nleaving school all together. Doors were<br />\nopened up for people who might either<br />\nhave been unable to afford or unable to<br />\ntake an interest in academics under the<br />\nmore traditional system.<br />\nWhat is important now is that while<br />\nwe are being forced, for economic reasons,<br />\nto learn from the flaws of what are already<br />\n\"the good old days,\" we don't lose sight of<br />\ntheir good points. Students in this new era<br />\nare going to find it ever more important to<br /><br />\nknow why they are in college. That's<br />\nnot to say that we should all go the preprofessional route, but for those of us who<br />\nare here simply for learning's sake, learning<br />\nshould become a more serious commitment. It's hard to be serious when you're<br />\n18, have a girlfriend or boyfriend, and are<br />\nliving away from home for the first time,<br />\nand maybe this should be a real consideration when it comes time to apply to<br />\nschools. In many ways, a liberal arts<br />\neducation is more ideally suited to someone who is 65 years old: one needs to be in<br />\na contemplative mood to read Dante, and<br />\none also needs to have had other experiences which make one appreciate the<br />\nDante.<br />\nto<br />\nread<br />\nopportunity<br />\nThis week, the Student Council<br />\nEducation Committee has proposed an<br />\ninvestigation into the faculty-student<br />\nadvising program. A survey, taken two and<br />\na half years ago, indicates that many<br />\nstudents are dissatisfied with the program<br />\nand that many professors do not take their<br />\nadvging obligation very seriously. Here is at<br />\nleast one specific area where changes,<br />\nappropriate for this \"new era in education,\"<br />\ncould take place. Advisors should first of<br />\nall be impressed with the importance of<br />\ntheir responsibility. They should work<br />\nclosely with both the Career Advising<br />\nOffice and the Office of Advising and<br />\nCounseling to devise a specific program,<br />\nwhich would include a certain number of<br />\nregular meetings. Advisors, even those who<br />\nlack great interpersonal skills, could be<br />\nrequired to talk to students about career<br />\nand educational goals, summer job plans,<br />\nand related interests. Specific steps such as<br />\nthese might eliminate the 'nothing to talk<br />\nabout' void that both students and faculty<br />\ncomplain about.<br />\nOf course, with Hopkins' we don't<br />\nbaby-sit you' philosophy, it may be unreasonable to expect faculty members to<br />\ntake on these additional responsibilities.<br />\nPerhaps the Office of Advising and Counseling could develop a larger staff and<br />\nperform these functions\u2014with its present<br />\nnumber of personnel, already on overload,<br />\nthis would be impossible.<br />\nThe point is that college is getting to<br />\nbe too expensive an experience to let slip<br />\naway. It is often the student who is at fault<br />\nfor . not seeking advice, but people who<br />\nneed help don't always ask for it. People<br />\nwho don't can't suffer from the opportunity.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br /><br />\nor at least my by-line was.

In<br />\nbut a few weeks at Hopkins, I<br />\nhave heard various horror stories<br />\nof, quite simply, paper stealing.<br />\nThe practice is hardly new: a<br />\nprofessor incorporates a student's work into his own paper,<br />\nor adds his name to the credits \u2014<br />\nalmost always first.<br />\nThe social dynamics inherent in this practice are well<br />\nknown: the pressure to publish,<br />\nthe notion that an \"established\"<br />\nname will facilitate acceptance,<br />\nor even the recognition that<br />\nvarious grant agencies require a<br />\nstudent to submit a:- project under<br /><br />\nthe professor's name. When the<br />\nstudent is merely playing the<br />\nrole of researcher, or otherwise<br />\ndrawing substantially on the<br />\nresources and prior work of the<br />\nprofessor, dual \u2014 or even a<br />\nprofessorial claim of authorship<br />\nwould seem appropriate. But<br />\nthe practice of \"signing on\"<br />\nseems to extend beyond these<br />\nsituations to work for which the<br />\nprofessor has little or no substantial claim.<br />\nAll of the cases I have heard<br />\nhave been presented with a<br />\ncombined sense of outrage and<br />\nfrustration. To refuse, let alone<br />\ncomplain, is to jeopardize one's<br />\nprogress toward the degree.<br />\nAnd so student after student<br />\nbuckles under to \"the system.\"<br />\nNothing changes. And each new<br />\ngeneration confronts the same<br />\nsituation.

Yatchisin asks how the News-Letter can<br />\nattack WJHU for giving shows to non-students when we have some<br />\ncontributors who are nonstudents. The answer is that the N-L's<br />\nnon-student contributors, unlike WJHUs, do not take<br />\naway<br />\nopportunities from those who are students. The non-students do<br />\nnot hold editorial positions and cannot vote in N-L elections and<br />\npolicy decisions. This week, to avoid confusion on this matter, the<br />\nnames of all non-student contributors have been removed from the<br />\nstaff-box.<br /><br />\nYatchisin's Resignation<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nparticularly because it worked<br />\nthrough innuendos.

Since the only real law<br />\nthe News-Letter can break is<br />\nthat of libel (which you seem<br />\nnot too worried about while<br /><br />\nhinting of \"intentional exclusionary tactics\" and \"just plain<br />\nincompetence\"), I don't think<br />\nthe paper has any right to<br />\ncriticize a desire for professionalism as it may just keep the U.S.<br />\ngovernment happy.<br />\nBy the way, I'm an undergraduate student at Hopkins and<br />\ngot a show on WJHU beginning<br />\nthis summer.

Nicaragua<br />\nalso has a huge foreign debt,<br />\npartially inherited from the<br />\nSomoza regime. Western and<br />\ndomestic investors have been<br />\npulling their capital out in<br />\nresponse to what they see as a<br />\nbleak future for private investment. Daniel Ortega Saadveara,<br />\nchief of the Sandinista junta,<br />\nhas said with considerable understatement that \"the situation of<br />\nthe country is not normal.\" His<br />\ngovernment has reacted by raising import taxes and adopting<br />\nausterity measures which involve<br />\na five percent cut in the budget<br />\nand a 10 percent cut in subsidized food and public services.<br />\nThomas Enders, the American State Department official in<br />\ncharge of Latin American affairs,<br />\nvisited Nicaragua in mid-August<br />\nto hold discussions with the<br />\nSandinista Directorate. Since<br />\nthe cutoff of U.S. aid over arms<br />\nshipments to El Salvador, U.S.-<br /><br />\nNicaragua relations have been<br />\ndeteriorating. At issue are the<br />\nSandinistas' questionably democratic and potentially antiWestern domestic and foreign<br />\npolicies. On the foreign front,<br />\nthe U.S. is displeased with the<br />\nsubstantial presence of Cuban<br />\nand Eastern European military<br />\nadvisers, technicians, and social<br />\nworkers. The buildup of the<br />\nNicaraguan army, already the<br />\nlargest in Central American with<br />\n22,000 men, alarms many. The<br />\nSandinistas wish to establish an<br />\narmy of 50,000 men. The<br />\nDirectorate has also been lengthening the airstrip outside of<br />\nPuerto Cabezas to the point<br />\nwhere anything that presently<br />\nflies can land there. The Sandinista Directorate portrays this<br />\nbuildup as a measure to protect<br />\nitself from the conservative<br />\nCentral American governments<br />\nto the North, and from the<br />\nU.S. This argument does not<br />\nhold much water as the armies in<br />\nEl Salvador and Guatemala are<br /><br />\nfully occupied with the guerilla<br />\ninsurrections in their respective<br />\ncountries.<br />\nThe U.S. is not<br />\nlikely to do much in Nicaragua<br />\nas several vocal segments of the<br />\nU.S. population decry even<br />\nlimited U.S. assistance to El<br />\nSalvador. The Nicaraguans' fear<br />\nof U.S. intervention has its roots<br />\nin the fact that U.S. marines<br />\noccupied Nicaragua for over a<br />\ndecade.<br />\nDomestically, the seriousness of the Sandinistas' commitment to democratic pluralism<br />\ncan easily be questioned. The<br />\nSandinistas have postponed elections until the mid 1980s.<br />\nOpposition political parties have<br />\nbeen discouraged, by decrees<br />\nand Sandinista-organized mob<br />\naction, from holding large meetings. Managua's Archbishop<br />\nObano Y Bravo, who spoke so<br />\nbravely \u2014 if not intelligently \u2014<br />\nin opposition to Somoza, is no<br />\nlonger allowed to broadcast his<br />\nSunday sermons. The indepen<br />\ndent newspaper La Prensa,<br /><br />\nwhich was the foremost critic of<br />\nSomoza, has been shut down on<br />\nseveral occasions because of its<br />\ncriticism of the Sandinistas.<br />\nThe Sandinistas have also<br />\nadopted a number of what many<br />\nconsider to be highly non-democratic moves such as banning all<br />\nstrikes and decreeing that anyone who has been out of the<br />\ncountry for six months or more<br />\nis liable to have his property<br />\nseized.<br />\nWhile most members of the<br />\nNational Directorate of the<br />\nSandinista Front believe Nicaragua should move toward a<br />\nMarxist-Leninist model, there is<br />\nconsiderable disagreement on<br />\nthe means and rate of change.<br />\nNicaragua is currently receiving<br />\naid from Mexico, Libya, and the<br />\nU.S.S.R. The U.S. has lost<br />\nleverage in Nicaragua with its<br />\ncutoff of aid. American actions<br />\ntoward Nicaragua should not<br />\nbe extreme enough to provide a<br />\nscapegoat for their difficulties.<br />\nSimilarly, it should be remem-<br /><br />\nbered that the Nicaraguan revolution, unlike the guerilla insurgency in El Salvador, was a<br />\nnationalistic revolution, involving all classes. The U.S. should<br />\ntake steps to encourage democracy, which means using the<br />\ncarrot (economic aid) and not<br />\nthe stick as a means of leverage.<br />\nExcessive U.S. pressure could<br />\nforce the Sandinistas into snuffing out all opposition in the<br />\nname of national security. It<br />\nmust be remembered that there<br />\nare still people in the private<br />\nsector, church, opposition parties, and La Prensa who are<br />\nfighting for pluralism. However,<br />\nit should be emphasized that<br />\nonce the democratic elements<br />\nhave clearly lost out, it would be<br />\nfoolish to throw good money<br />\nafter bad.<br />\nicott Shires is a senior, studying<br />\n'nternational relations.

It was late Saturday night, I wasn't tired, and<br />\nI'd heard that the Mighty Invaders and Determination<br />\nwere playing at the \"Arena\" on Paca Street. I'd never<br />\nheard of the place, and haven't since, but that night I<br />\ndrove downtown and walked fearlessly into the Arena.<br />\nIt wasn't a bar, nor a concert hall, but something of an<br />\nabandoned warehouse. The inside was almost totally<br />\ndark, with the exception of a handful of blue lights<br />\nwhich were diffused into a cloud of smoke. Never had I<br />\nseen so many ganji splifs (marijuana cigarettes) bobbing<br />\nlike fireflies in the darkness. The band was hammering<br />\nout a beat which could totally absorb you, make your<br />\nself-consciousness vanish into the music. But nonetheless I was self-conscious. I was the only white person<br />\nthere, and I was dressed conspicuously casually in blue<br />\njeans. The rest of the crowd was dressed as if for<br />\nchurch; the men in white shirts with black vests, sometimes wearing rounded tophats or felt caps, and the<br />\nwomen in sun dresses. They spoke in a heavy West<br />\nIndian accent which I could barely understand. Along<br />\nthe cinderblock walls tables were set up where you could<br />\nbuy rice and some sort of stew which I think they said<br />\nwas muskrat. No one seemed to mind that I was there,<br />\nbut nevertheless I felt as if I were intruding. It was only<br />\nafter a short, lively fellow greeted me, told me to feel<br />\nwelcome, and shared his splif with me that I began to<br />\nfeel very comfortable. Soon I too got up to dance in<br />\nfront of the band. It puzzled me that most people stood<br />\nin the darkness of the back, dancing alone in their own<br />\nareas. I began to suspect there was more to reggae than<br />\njust dancing.<br />\nThe lyrics always puzzled me. Who is this \"Jah\"<br />\nfellow, and who are \"I and I,\" and what's a \"crazy bald<br />\nhead,\" or a \"Rastaman\"? Determined to discover the<br />\ninner truths of reggae, I arranged an interview with<br />\nStetford (\"King\") Clark, the leader and bass guitarist of<br />\nthe Mighty Invaders. In the basement of a rowhouse<br />\nbehind Pimlico Race Track, King Clark gave me the<br />\nlowdown in his heavy Jamaican accent:<br />\nN-L: What religion are most reggae performers?<br />\nTony: Rastafarian.<br /><br />\n'(We want) a world<br />\nwhere there's peace,<br />\nlove, and unity, with<br />\nequal rights and justice.'<br /><br />\nBaltimore, so reggae dances have become religious<br />\nmeeting places rather than just informal entertainment.<br />\nUnlike many religious groups, the Rastas believe<br />\nin taking some sort of positive action towards making<br />\nthe world a better place. In the words of international<br />\nreggae star Peter Tosh, \"You've got to get up, stand up,<br />\nstand up for your rights.\" This immediately made<br />\nme wonder where they stood in the political arena.<br />\nN-L: What sort of world are the Rastafarians hoping to<br />\ncreate?<br />\nTony: A world where there's peace, love, and unity,<br />\nwith equal rights and justice.<br />\nN-L: What do you mean by peace, love, and unity?<br />\nTony: No fighting, no stealing, no prejudice. I mean,if<br />\na man is white or black, they both bleed red blood. Just<br />\nlike if a dog is black or white, it don't make no difference<br />\nN-L: Why do you think people steal?<br />\nTony: Well, like when me and my brothers come here<br />\nfrom Jamaica, if we didn't make music, we would have<br />\nno jobs. I go in and I ask for a job, and the man says<br />\n\"Take off your hat.\" He sees my hair all knotted up and<br />\nhe says \"you can't have a job with your hair like that.\"<br />\nI tell him this is the way my hair naturally is, so I don't<br />\ncut it, but I don't have a job either. I was an apprentice<br />\nto a bricklayer when I first came here, but I said \"fuck<br />\nthat shit.\" So what do you do? Some brothers will take<br />\nout a knife and go steal something, and I can understand<br />\nthat because we all got to eat. But there's a lot of bad<br />\nmen, \"evil-doers.\" We call them \"Dreadlocks,\" and they<br />\ngo out and kill and steal. Killing is wrong, man, because<br />\nonce you're dead you're never coming back. When I say<br />\n\"Dreadlocks\" I don't mean that they wear their hair in<br />\ndreadloacks, though some do because they think it's<br />\ngoing to scare people. Some of them may have shaved<br />\ntheir heads.<br />\nBut they're not Rastafarians.<br />\nN-L: Are the \"Dreadlocks\" also Jamaicans?<br />\nTony: They're from all over, man.<br />\nFrom experiences I'd had with the Rastafarians,<br />\nand from what Tony Clark told me, I was convinced that<br />\nthe Rastas were dedicated to ridding the world of racial<br />\nprejudice. But because they are a religious group, I had<br />\nmy suspicions about subtler forms of prejudice.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of other religious groups, even<br />\nnon-Christians?<br />\nTony: We're all worshipping the same thing. If a man<br />\ncomes up to you and tells you he worships his dog as<br />\nGod, you go \"okay,\" and you may think he's crazy, but<br />\nto him that dog is God. The Bible says God manifests<br />\nhimself in many forms.<br />\nN-L: Do you think women deserve equal rights and<br />\njustice?<br />\nTony: Women are women, and men are men, and in<br />\nsome ways women are weaker than men. But I think<br />\nthey should have equal rights and justice, sure, sure.<br />\nN-L: Would most Rastafarians agree with you on that<br />\naccount?<br />\nTony: If you had eight Rastafarians, you'd get eight<br />\ndifferent answers.<br />\nN-L: What about homosexuals? Do you think they<br />\ndeserve equal rights and justice.<br />\nTony: Pshew, that stuff is crazy. It's Babylon, man.<br />\nMichelle and Stanley Cole (keyboards, percussion<br />\nand backup vocals) showed up, and occasionally Stanley<br />\njoined in the conversation. All seemed to object to<br />\nhomosexuality, mostly because the bible objects to it.<br />\nWhen the group spoke among themselves, they<br />\nsounded very different than they did when talking<br />\nto me. When I asked them what language they were<br />\nspeaking, Stanley said, laughing, \"That's English, man.<br />\nYou just don't recognize the way we slur our words.\"<br />\nI was still unclear about where the Rastas stood<br />\npolitically and further questioning produced no conclusive answer to this question.<br /><br />\nN-L: Where would you place Rastafarians on the<br />\npolitical spectrum, to the right or to the left?<br />\nN-L: Is that a Christian religion?<br />\nTony:<br />\nWell, you know, when a man doesn't have a job,<br />\nChristian.<br />\nof<br />\nTony: Yes, we're Christians, our own kind<br />\nand can't get the money to feed his family and himself,<br />\nEventually I learned what he meant. Rastamen he has to do something.<br />\nbelieve basically that Haile Selassie,(the late emperor of<br />\nEthiopia) is a messiah, like Christ. They also call him N-L: What do you think should be done about unemand God \"Jah\" from the word Jahova, or the ployment?<br />\n\"Selasieai.\" The word Rastafarian comes from Selassie's Tony: I don't want to answer that now because it's a<br />\nname before he became emperor; Ras Tafari. Like many difficult problem,a very difficult problem. But the guys<br />\nChristians, they believe that Jah \"walks before them,\" with all the money, if they'd build apartment buildings<br />\nprotecting them from harm, and that eventually Jah will or put their money into the community and create jobs,<br />\nhelp his people reunite. Rationally enough, they believe rather than spending it on themselves...I don't know.<br />\nthat Africa is the homeland, the cradle of civilization.<br />\nThey don't eat pork, they avoid alcohol, coffee, and tea, N-L: Do you think it's unfair that some people are very<br />\nand they smoke marijuana religiously \"for inspiration.\". wealthy and others are very poor?<br />\nLike many religious groups they believe much of the real Tony: I don't care who's rich and who's poor.

They also seem dedicated to living by<br />\nChristian morals. They seem to lack a concrete notion<br />\nof how to bring about social change, and disagree<br />\nsomewhat among themselves as to what social change is<br />\nappropriate and how to bring it about. This confusion<br />\nstems from a somewhat naive view of the causes of<br />\nproblems such as unemployment, pointing their finger at<br />\n\"evildoers\" and avaricious rich, rather than at problems<br />\ninherent in the social structure. Living by Christian<br />\nmorality, many would argue, would deprive homosexuals and women of equal rights and justice.
