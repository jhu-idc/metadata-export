While a pouring rain<br />\nOinked the spectators in the stands, Harry Wilson and his West<br />\nPoint comrades battered away at the Jay defense. Finally, in the<br />\nsecond half, Hopkins' resistance to the onslaught was broken. Led<br />\nby Wilton, the Army stickmen plowed through the mud to score a<br />\nclean-cut win. With that loss, the Jays' hopes of representing Amer;<br />\nica in the Olympics sank to a low ebb.<br />\n.Tomorrow, when the Jays invade the West Point battle-field,<br />\nthey will be seeking revenge. Army, on the other hand, should also<br />\nbe in fine fighting form. After losing to St. John's, the military college stickmen will be out for blood at the expense of the Hopkins<br />\nteam.<br />\n\u2022 To date, the record of the HomewoOd outfit has been most en,<br />\ncouraging to supporters of the Jays. By keeping the 'opposition<br />\nscoreless in two games, the defense has given a rare exhibition of<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\nskill. Corner Brownley, at goal, has proven a worthy successor to<br />\nRay Finn. Although not as strong as the defense, the attack has<br />\nmaintained a steady bombardment against the opposition's goal. However, when they face the Cadets tomorrow, the Blue Jays will experience their first important test of the new season. After the<br />\nArmy battle, it will be possibfe to give a fair estimate of the poten<br />\nnalities of the new twelve.,<br />\n-When the Jays depart \u2022 for the north, they will take with them<br />\nthe best wishes and moral support of the entire student body.<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\n. THE \"DOCTOR'S\" DILEMMA<br />\nHEN the average American citizen hears the 'word,<br />\n<br />\nJohns<br />\nHopkins, he immediately conjures. up the vision of a medical school and hospital. He sees white,elad surgeons carving out<br />\nappendixes, nurses-in stiffly starched linen, patients in wheel chairs,<br />\nrows of beds, bewhiskered physicians, stacks of Medical books, labors''<br />\ntories filled with test tikes and walls covered with anatomical charts.<br />\nSince Johns Hopkins is a medical school, enaturally follows that all<br />\nstudents who attend Johns Hopkins are medical students.<br />\nThus, on the average of once a week, the scholar who attends<br />\nthe College. of Arts and Sciences is subjected to the following rather<br />\ndisioncerting catechism:<br />\n-What are you doing<br />\n\"Going to college.'<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\"Where\"<br />\n\u2022 \"Johns Hopkins..\"Oh, I didn't know<br />\n<br />\nyou were going to be a doctor.Then, the poor unfortunate is forced to enter into a detailed discussion of the various departments of the University and conclude<br />\nhis lecture with a statement of his life purpose.

While a pouring rain<br />\nOinked the spectators in the stands, Harry Wilson and his West<br />\nPoint comrades battered away at the Jay defense. Finally, in the<br />\nsecond half, Hopkins' resistance to the onslaught was broken. Led<br />\nby Wilton, the Army stickmen plowed through the mud to score a<br />\nclean-cut win. With that loss, the Jays' hopes of representing Amer;<br />\nica in the Olympics sank to a low ebb.<br />\n.Tomorrow, when the Jays invade the West Point battle-field,<br />\nthey will be seeking revenge. Army, on the other hand, should also<br />\nbe in fine fighting form. After losing to St. John's, the military college stickmen will be out for blood at the expense of the Hopkins<br />\nteam.<br />\n\u2022 To date, the record of the HomewoOd outfit has been most en,<br />\ncouraging to supporters of the Jays. By keeping the 'opposition<br />\nscoreless in two games, the defense has given a rare exhibition of<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\nskill. Corner Brownley, at goal, has proven a worthy successor to<br />\nRay Finn. Although not as strong as the defense, the attack has<br />\nmaintained a steady bombardment against the opposition's goal. However, when they face the Cadets tomorrow, the Blue Jays will experience their first important test of the new season. After the<br />\nArmy battle, it will be possibfe to give a fair estimate of the poten<br />\nnalities of the new twelve.,<br />\n-When the Jays depart \u2022 for the north, they will take with them<br />\nthe best wishes and moral support of the entire student body.<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\n. THE \"DOCTOR'S\" DILEMMA<br />\nHEN the average American citizen hears the 'word,<br /><br />\nJohns<br />\nHopkins, he immediately conjures. up the vision of a medical school and hospital. He sees white,elad surgeons carving out<br />\nappendixes, nurses-in stiffly starched linen, patients in wheel chairs,<br />\nrows of beds, bewhiskered physicians, stacks of Medical books, labors''<br />\ntories filled with test tikes and walls covered with anatomical charts.<br />\nSince Johns Hopkins is a medical school, enaturally follows that all<br />\nstudents who attend Johns Hopkins are medical students.<br />\nThus, on the average of once a week, the scholar who attends<br />\nthe College. of Arts and Sciences is subjected to the following rather<br />\ndisioncerting catechism:<br />\n-What are you doing<br />\n\"Going to college.'<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\"Where\"<br />\n\u2022 \"Johns Hopkins..\"Oh, I didn't know<br /><br />\nyou were going to be a doctor.Then, the poor unfortunate is forced to enter into a detailed discussion of the various departments of the University and conclude<br />\nhis lecture with a statement of his life purpose.
