It would create and introduce<br />\ninto our midst a cumbrous political<br />\nmachinery, I absolutely unnecessary,<br />\nand prolific in sources of strife. And<br />\nthis political machinery, it would aim<br />\nto use as a medium of justice in a<br />\nmatter far too sacred to afford a<br />\nproper field for politics. This can<br />\nhardly be the intention of the framers of this plan. But at all events,<br />\nI cannot see what difference it makes<br />\nwhether a man belong to a fraternity<br />\nor not so long as he has taken oath<br />\nto dispense justice impartially. The<br />\nintroduction of matters of this nature seems to argue but too plainly<br />\nthat the constitution which lies before us is a political constitution;<br />\nand it seems to me that an honor<br />\nsystem conducted on political lines<br />\nwould be a positive evil.<br />\nLet it not be thought from what I<br />\nhave said that I am inflexibly adverse<br />\nto the \"Honor System. For my own<br />\nhowever, I think the simpler the<br />\nmethods the more satisfactory the results. I feel sure that there are<br />\nmany other undergraduates in the<br />\nUniversity who think likewise. There<br />\nhas been a deplorable tendency, however, on the part of many students<br />\nhere, to pass carelessly over matters<br />\nof the greatest importance, readily<br />\nfollowing the first person to offer a<br />\nsuggestion. In the matter of the<br />\n\"Honor System,\" this tendency has<br />\nbeen more than usually evident. The<br />\n\"Honor. System,\" it is argued, \"is<br />\nproposed; to reject such a proposition wi-s-Td be a lasting disgrace ;therefore we must adopt the system without further consideration. The system must be put into execution<br />\nthrough a constitution; to reject a<br />\nconstitution aiming at so laudable an<br />\nobject would be most ungenerous:<br />\ntherefore we must accept the first<br />\nconstitution proposed.\" The adoption of the honor system is indeed<br />\na serious and a sacred thing; but for<br />\nthat reason it ought the more carefully to he considered. To this ste<br />\nwe have now practically bound ourselves; therefore we ought now to be<br />\ndoubly cautious in taking the final<br />\nstep of proi;iding for the execution<br />\nof the system. Each man ought to<br />\nthink for himself, and look carefully<br />\nat both sides of the proposed plan:<br />\nand the more heartily he is in favor<br />\nof the Honor System, the more willing he ought to be to reject any constitution that does not meet with his<br />\nentire approval.<br />\n\"Prudens.\"<br />\n<br />\nDEBATE TEAM CHOSEN<br />\nThe preliminary tria!s for the Intercolleciate Debate with Washington and Lee University were held in<br />\nMcCoy Hall Thursday afternoon.

After the usual business of the Society<br />\nhad been transacted a paper written<br />\nby Professor G. A. Barton of BrynMawr College, was read by Professor C. C. Torrey of Yale.<br />\nThe writer attacked the attitude of<br />\nProfessor Hilprecht, both in attaching any importance to the tablet recently discovered by him, and because of the elementary blunders<br />\nmade in interpreting the inscription.<br />\nProfessor Haupt said that he had<br />\ndiscovered the same historical fact<br />\nwhich the tablet records twenty years<br />\nago.<br />\nThe declared sentiment of the<br />\nmembers is that the find is not of the<br />\nleast importance, and that it cannot<br />\nhelp but reflect greatly on the scholarly reputation of its advocate.

It would create and introduce<br />\ninto our midst a cumbrous political<br />\nmachinery, I absolutely unnecessary,<br />\nand prolific in sources of strife. And<br />\nthis political machinery, it would aim<br />\nto use as a medium of justice in a<br />\nmatter far too sacred to afford a<br />\nproper field for politics. This can<br />\nhardly be the intention of the framers of this plan. But at all events,<br />\nI cannot see what difference it makes<br />\nwhether a man belong to a fraternity<br />\nor not so long as he has taken oath<br />\nto dispense justice impartially. The<br />\nintroduction of matters of this nature seems to argue but too plainly<br />\nthat the constitution which lies before us is a political constitution;<br />\nand it seems to me that an honor<br />\nsystem conducted on political lines<br />\nwould be a positive evil.<br />\nLet it not be thought from what I<br />\nhave said that I am inflexibly adverse<br />\nto the \"Honor System. For my own<br />\nhowever, I think the simpler the<br />\nmethods the more satisfactory the results. I feel sure that there are<br />\nmany other undergraduates in the<br />\nUniversity who think likewise. There<br />\nhas been a deplorable tendency, however, on the part of many students<br />\nhere, to pass carelessly over matters<br />\nof the greatest importance, readily<br />\nfollowing the first person to offer a<br />\nsuggestion. In the matter of the<br />\n\"Honor System,\" this tendency has<br />\nbeen more than usually evident. The<br />\n\"Honor. System,\" it is argued, \"is<br />\nproposed; to reject such a proposition wi-s-Td be a lasting disgrace ;therefore we must adopt the system without further consideration. The system must be put into execution<br />\nthrough a constitution; to reject a<br />\nconstitution aiming at so laudable an<br />\nobject would be most ungenerous:<br />\ntherefore we must accept the first<br />\nconstitution proposed.\" The adoption of the honor system is indeed<br />\na serious and a sacred thing; but for<br />\nthat reason it ought the more carefully to he considered. To this ste<br />\nwe have now practically bound ourselves; therefore we ought now to be<br />\ndoubly cautious in taking the final<br />\nstep of proi;iding for the execution<br />\nof the system. Each man ought to<br />\nthink for himself, and look carefully<br />\nat both sides of the proposed plan:<br />\nand the more heartily he is in favor<br />\nof the Honor System, the more willing he ought to be to reject any constitution that does not meet with his<br />\nentire approval.<br />\n\"Prudens.\"<br /><br />\nDEBATE TEAM CHOSEN<br />\nThe preliminary tria!s for the Intercolleciate Debate with Washington and Lee University were held in<br />\nMcCoy Hall Thursday afternoon.
