To some the wording of<br />\nthe motion was unsuitable; to<br />\nothers the length of time allowed<br />\nfor a petition to be circulated<br />\namong the students seemed too<br />\nshort; to still others the power<br />\nof the SC to defer its decision<br />\non any such amendment was<br />\nundesirable.<br />\nA number of the Council<br />\nmaintained that since the minutes of any DSRC meeting were<br />\nnot posted for some time after<br />\nthe meeting took place, the students would not have a whole<br />\nweek in which to secure a petition.

Yet in all honesty,<br />\nafter reading and re-reading his<br />\nwords, I found only minute substance for his superficial ideas.<br />\nI consider it a bad review not<br />\nso much for his principal criticism, but for his adeptness at<br />\nejecting sundry uncomplimentay remarks with absolutely no<br />\nsubstantiating basis.<br />\nLet me begin by saying that<br />\nalthough I disagree in part with<br />\nMr. Sofko's analysis of the actors' performances, he made<br />\nsome wise and well-placed criticism. This phase of the review<br />\nit is not my part to comment on,<br />\nhowever, for being on stage myself, I cannot judge the talent<br />\nof my conferes or myself with<br />\nthe disinterestedness of a spectator. I can only differ in opinion as to his criticism leveled at<br />\nthe director and the play itself.<br />\nMr. Sofko begins his remarks<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\nEast and West<br />\nThe initial report of what seems to be some form<br />\nOf a llopkins Goucher Coordination Committee is discouraging for two reasons.<br />\nThe first is the basic complaint of the Goucher<br />\ngirls that they are dissatisfied with the current American dating procedure. We would suggest that the girls<br />\naccept this practice as it exists for it will in no way be<br />\nchanged by more mixers. We note that each week a<br />\nmixer is held at Hopkins which the Goucher girls apparently disdain, perhaps because of indirect lighting<br />\nand lack of chess boards.<br />\nMoreover, we see no reason why the Hopkins fraternities which are apparently satisfied in the main<br />\nwith normal dating procedures should acquiesce to<br />\nGoucher's wishes in this subject. Our only suggestion is<br />\nif the Goucher girl desires a mixer such as described,<br />\nshe should hold it at Goucher and invite Hopkins men.<br />\nSecondly, we note that the idea of coordinating<br />\nvarious parallel activities on the two campuses has<br />\nalready been tried by the original committee. Apparently<br />\nthe failure of such coordination was due to lack of<br />\ninterest at both schools. There is no reason why this<br />\nsituation should have changed during the past three<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\nmonths.<br />\nIn essence, it would seem that coordination between<br />\nHopkins and Goucher on any formal level is unnecessary. If individual clubs wish to get together, more<br />\npower to them. But there would seem to be no rhyme<br />\nor reason for a repetition of past failures and further<br />\n\"official\" meetings.

The only fault<br />\nhe seems to be able to find with<br />\nthe direction is that \"hands ...<br />\nare not really that much like<br />\nhamhocks.\" Now if, as is supposed, Mr. Sofko believes an actor used his members in such<br />\na way, and he does not approve,<br />\nthen the blame should be placed<br />\nwith the person in question, not<br />\nthe director. Even if it were the<br />\ndirector's fault, this is hardly<br />\njustification to call him a poor<br />\none.

Yet in all honesty,<br />\nafter reading and re-reading his<br />\nwords, I found only minute substance for his superficial ideas.<br />\nI consider it a bad review not<br />\nso much for his principal criticism, but for his adeptness at<br />\nejecting sundry uncomplimentay remarks with absolutely no<br />\nsubstantiating basis.<br />\nLet me begin by saying that<br />\nalthough I disagree in part with<br />\nMr. Sofko's analysis of the actors' performances, he made<br />\nsome wise and well-placed criticism. This phase of the review<br />\nit is not my part to comment on,<br />\nhowever, for being on stage myself, I cannot judge the talent<br />\nof my conferes or myself with<br />\nthe disinterestedness of a spectator. I can only differ in opinion as to his criticism leveled at<br />\nthe director and the play itself.<br />\nMr. Sofko begins his remarks<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br /><br />\nEast and West<br />\nThe initial report of what seems to be some form<br />\nOf a llopkins Goucher Coordination Committee is discouraging for two reasons.<br />\nThe first is the basic complaint of the Goucher<br />\ngirls that they are dissatisfied with the current American dating procedure. We would suggest that the girls<br />\naccept this practice as it exists for it will in no way be<br />\nchanged by more mixers. We note that each week a<br />\nmixer is held at Hopkins which the Goucher girls apparently disdain, perhaps because of indirect lighting<br />\nand lack of chess boards.<br />\nMoreover, we see no reason why the Hopkins fraternities which are apparently satisfied in the main<br />\nwith normal dating procedures should acquiesce to<br />\nGoucher's wishes in this subject. Our only suggestion is<br />\nif the Goucher girl desires a mixer such as described,<br />\nshe should hold it at Goucher and invite Hopkins men.<br />\nSecondly, we note that the idea of coordinating<br />\nvarious parallel activities on the two campuses has<br />\nalready been tried by the original committee. Apparently<br />\nthe failure of such coordination was due to lack of<br />\ninterest at both schools. There is no reason why this<br />\nsituation should have changed during the past three<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\nmonths.<br />\nIn essence, it would seem that coordination between<br />\nHopkins and Goucher on any formal level is unnecessary. If individual clubs wish to get together, more<br />\npower to them. But there would seem to be no rhyme<br />\nor reason for a repetition of past failures and further<br />\n\"official\" meetings. After all, Hopkins is not Goucher<br />\nand Goucher is not Hopkins, and there is no compulsion<br />\nthat the twain should meet.<br /><br />\nS'ick\u2018A)jeg..<br />\nYou guys finish decorating for the house party yet?<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, DECEMBER 15, 1961<br /><br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nDaily 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.<br />\nMon., Thurs., Fri.
