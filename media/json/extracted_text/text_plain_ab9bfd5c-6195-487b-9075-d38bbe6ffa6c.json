In his assimilation<br />\nand inculcation of the principle of the student body, to introduce him<br />\nto a custom that is a part of the University itself, it was deemed a<br />\npoint of wisdom to require the student to speak during the first year<br />\nof his residence. Acairdingly, a clause to this effect was inserted in<br />\nthe Freshman Regulations. Never after the first year, however, is<br />\na man required to speak. In that year most of them forget<br />\nthat they<br />\nare compelled to do so and fall into the habit naturally and pleasantly.<br />\nAnd the habit continues into the later years .brightening for each<br />\nindividual his surroundings.<br />\nSome men are found who do not live up to the spirit of the<br />\n\"hello.\" Some are bound tO kick. By this time, however, it is easy<br />\nto place most of the men who may be described as \"grouches\" and<br />\nothers who do not desire to speak. They can be ignored as they<br />\nshould be and considered non-existent. They are not worthy of the<br />\nthought which might mar a pleasant frame of mind. Also, there are<br />\nthose who deem it beneath their dignity to speak first and some to<br />\nwhom speaking is so much trouble, so irritating. If a man does not<br />\ncare to speak, then why speak to him?<br />\nAt this period in the year there is met a perceptible slacking in<br />\ngreetings, which in many ways is natural and must be continued in<br />\nthat light. The tension of the first semester has broken followed by<br />\nthe usual period of seeming indifference which only indicates a let<br />\nup and a relief and a period of recovery.<br />\n<br />\nBAN STILL ON TROPHY<br />\nROOM, SAYS MAGILL<br />\n<br />\nFOUR MORE TAG DAYS TO<br />\nBE HELD<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n37 Days<br />\nExpenses<br />\nAn<br />\n<br />\nA tour to the shrines of the great in<br />\nArt,Literature and Music with sightseeing tripi in care of academic<br />\nguides.

In his assimilation<br />\nand inculcation of the principle of the student body, to introduce him<br />\nto a custom that is a part of the University itself, it was deemed a<br />\npoint of wisdom to require the student to speak during the first year<br />\nof his residence. Acairdingly, a clause to this effect was inserted in<br />\nthe Freshman Regulations. Never after the first year, however, is<br />\na man required to speak. In that year most of them forget<br />\nthat they<br />\nare compelled to do so and fall into the habit naturally and pleasantly.<br />\nAnd the habit continues into the later years .brightening for each<br />\nindividual his surroundings.<br />\nSome men are found who do not live up to the spirit of the<br />\n\"hello.\" Some are bound tO kick. By this time, however, it is easy<br />\nto place most of the men who may be described as \"grouches\" and<br />\nothers who do not desire to speak. They can be ignored as they<br />\nshould be and considered non-existent. They are not worthy of the<br />\nthought which might mar a pleasant frame of mind. Also, there are<br />\nthose who deem it beneath their dignity to speak first and some to<br />\nwhom speaking is so much trouble, so irritating. If a man does not<br />\ncare to speak, then why speak to him?<br />\nAt this period in the year there is met a perceptible slacking in<br />\ngreetings, which in many ways is natural and must be continued in<br />\nthat light. The tension of the first semester has broken followed by<br />\nthe usual period of seeming indifference which only indicates a let<br />\nup and a relief and a period of recovery.<br /><br />\nBAN STILL ON TROPHY<br />\nROOM, SAYS MAGILL<br /><br />\nFOUR MORE TAG DAYS TO<br />\nBE HELD<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\n37 Days<br />\nExpenses<br />\nAn<br /><br />\nA tour to the shrines of the great in<br />\nArt,Literature and Music with sightseeing tripi in care of academic<br />\nguides.
