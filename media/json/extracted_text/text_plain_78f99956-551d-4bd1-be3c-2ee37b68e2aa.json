Newspapers all over the United States, and probably in parts of<br />\nEurope, will pay tribute to the fiftieth anniversary of America's<br />\nforemost Medical School and Graduate School. It is obviously<br />\nnot for us to waste words echoing such sentiments.<br />\nThough the preponderance of these who have seen fit to comment upon the so-called New, Plan of President Goodnow have<br />\nhailed it as a vast step forward in the field of education itself,<br />\nfew, if any have looked for a deeper significance which may manifest itself as a positive s.tep forward toward the ultimate enrichment of actual human felicity.<br />\nWe wonder if there did not lurk in the mind of President<br />\nGoodnow an ideal loftier than the mere training of a few more<br />\nM. A.'s and Ph. D.'s. The building up of the Graduate School<br />\nhas been the feature of the plan which has received the most<br />\nemphasis; the granting of a more falorable environment to<br />\nwould-be doctors of philosophy has received the approval of many<br />\neminent educators.<br />\nBut what probably is the basis and the stimulation of the<br />\nplan of the President is a sincere belief in the final efficacy of the<br />\nmotto of Johns Hopkins University\u2014\"Veritas vos liberavit\".<br />\nFor he believes that the creation of the university of his dreams<br />\nwill awaken the dormant talents of potential Darwins, Kants,<br />\nLavoisiers, or Spencers.<br />\nWe cannot help but believe that President Goodnow is fostering a hope that the Johns Hopkins of the future will be a<br />\nhaven for benefactors of the human race. The Johns _Hopkins<br />\nthat he visualizes will be the home of far-reaching researches in all<br />\nfields of knowledge: it will be a magnet drawing to it the great<br />\nminds and curious truth-seekers of the globe.<br />\nThe New Plan, if analyzed more than superficially, is not<br />\npurely a scheme for a glorified Graduate School. It embodies<br />\nmuch more than an extended opportunity for \"higher education\":<br />\nit is an attempt to make an ideal a reality. It is the predication<br />\nof a further search for the so-far elusive philosopher's stone, and<br />\nas such is a glorious ideal.<br />\nWe of the Undergraduate Department are prone to look<br />\naskance at such extreme idealism. Many of us will condemn the<br />\ndream as sheer sentimentality. We may criticise it on many<br />\nother grounds than these.<br />\nBut in the last analysis, despite any objections of a practical nature that might be raised against the inauguration of the<br />\nNew Plan as outlined herewith, we are forced to admit that it<br />\niF a gorgeous ideal. We hope that it will become more than that.<br />\nThis week may be the beginning of a new era. It may set<br />\nthe cornerstone of a new search for Truth. Or it may be merely<br />\nthe fiftieth anniversary of an American university. Who will<br />\nventure a guess?<br />\n<br />\nYES AND NO<br />\nThe Shanghi Gesture<br />\nYou are in New York in, let us say 1880. You are a<br />\nsailor. Having been paid off some four months previously,<br />\nyour money is nearly gone. The necessity of having something to do presents itself in the form of unpaid room rent.<br />\nPicking up whatever clothing you happen to possess, it is<br />\nplunged into a sea-bag and you hie yourself to a waterfront<br />\nbar where there will be talk of ships and sailings ; of skippers<br />\nand bos'ns ; of articles and signing on. But as you pass the<br />\nline at the bar and your eye wanders about the tables in the<br />\nback room, searching in vain for familiar faces. You decide<br />\nthat you are desolately lonely.<br />\nSuddenly the swinging doors break in the middle and four<br />\nof your old shipmates are presented; boisterously happy. One<br />\nis with a clipper ship bound for Rio; another in a four master<br />\nto Sidney, still another to the East in a mail packet. The other<br />\nis going on a trip to the fishing banks that won't amount to<br />\nmuch. Ten minues before you would have welcomed the<br />\nchance to go anywhere. It would have been a pleasure. Now<br />\nwith fair friends bidding you go here and there, you decide to<br />\nbe choosey.<br />\nBut since you have last seen your old buddies they have<br />\nacquired a deep, dark purpose in life. They are now Bos'ils<br />\nfor their respective ship-masters. Their orders are to get you<br />\nat any price.<br />\nBeing a social creature, when they suggest getting a drink<br />\nor two you join them at the bar. Everything goes stilendidly<br />\nfor a while. They talk of their ships with a bit of ,swagger<br />\nand a deal of pride. The .treat is dutch. Being naturally<br />\ncautious you don't drink too much; your head is clear and<br />\nyou have a pretty fair chance to look them all over.<br />\nSo far the game is fair, the odds are about even. You go,<br />\nas a matter of course, to the man you really like best. The<br />\nparty decides to have a friendly poker game in the back-room<br />\nand you are invited to watch them if you so desire. There is<br />\none man you can't help but like, you like his style of play<br />\nand the way he conducts himself in the company of others.<br />\nPerhaps he drops you a word or two about the congeniality<br />\nof his shipmates., of the standing of his shipping cqmpany. In<br />\nthe next day or so you meet some of his bunkies and are, so<br />\nfar as sober judgment will permit, mentally decided that you<br />\nwill take one trip; you like ship, sailors and company.<br />\nBut one day when you are not present the whole group<br />\nget together and decide. on a plan of action.<br />\nThe following day you sense a feeling of unrestraint in<br />\ntheirgreetings. No longer are you asked to be your own<br />\nhost; wine flows freely at no cost to you; also finding that they<br />\nare fairy .folk who drag you about in coaches and money flows<br />\nas freely as the wine. A week wears on. Your head is becoming fuzzy, faces are blurred and that little man on the<br />\nfishing trip is much in evidence. But wassa diff'runce anyway? You are too tired to think and a bit too drunk to<br />\nreason. The little man still buzzes around. S'funny, when<br />\nyou were sober this little man didn't count for much. But<br />\nhe doesn't get far away; never leaves you alone. He holds his<br />\nliquor well too. . . . Getting more tired and drunker. . .<br />\n.Whoozit? ... can't see ... all drunk together ... HEY-A-DEY<br />\n. .. go ? ... go? alphabetagammadelta ... wassis ? . .. yesh .. .<br />\ns'at lil' guy again. Oh well.<br />\nYou wake up on November first, nineteen twenty-six,<br />\nwearing the uniform of the fishing trip. Around you are other<br />\ndeck-boys arrived in the same inanner as you. One or two by<br />\nchoice. The others don't quite know why. You are sure you<br />\ndon't. If it only hadn't been that one open week! . . . The<br />\nlittle man is not in sight.

Newspapers all over the United States, and probably in parts of<br />\nEurope, will pay tribute to the fiftieth anniversary of America's<br />\nforemost Medical School and Graduate School. It is obviously<br />\nnot for us to waste words echoing such sentiments.<br />\nThough the preponderance of these who have seen fit to comment upon the so-called New, Plan of President Goodnow have<br />\nhailed it as a vast step forward in the field of education itself,<br />\nfew, if any have looked for a deeper significance which may manifest itself as a positive s.tep forward toward the ultimate enrichment of actual human felicity.<br />\nWe wonder if there did not lurk in the mind of President<br />\nGoodnow an ideal loftier than the mere training of a few more<br />\nM. A.'s and Ph. D.'s. The building up of the Graduate School<br />\nhas been the feature of the plan which has received the most<br />\nemphasis; the granting of a more falorable environment to<br />\nwould-be doctors of philosophy has received the approval of many<br />\neminent educators.<br />\nBut what probably is the basis and the stimulation of the<br />\nplan of the President is a sincere belief in the final efficacy of the<br />\nmotto of Johns Hopkins University\u2014\"Veritas vos liberavit\".<br />\nFor he believes that the creation of the university of his dreams<br />\nwill awaken the dormant talents of potential Darwins, Kants,<br />\nLavoisiers, or Spencers.<br />\nWe cannot help but believe that President Goodnow is fostering a hope that the Johns Hopkins of the future will be a<br />\nhaven for benefactors of the human race. The Johns _Hopkins<br />\nthat he visualizes will be the home of far-reaching researches in all<br />\nfields of knowledge: it will be a magnet drawing to it the great<br />\nminds and curious truth-seekers of the globe.<br />\nThe New Plan, if analyzed more than superficially, is not<br />\npurely a scheme for a glorified Graduate School. It embodies<br />\nmuch more than an extended opportunity for \"higher education\":<br />\nit is an attempt to make an ideal a reality. It is the predication<br />\nof a further search for the so-far elusive philosopher's stone, and<br />\nas such is a glorious ideal.<br />\nWe of the Undergraduate Department are prone to look<br />\naskance at such extreme idealism. Many of us will condemn the<br />\ndream as sheer sentimentality. We may criticise it on many<br />\nother grounds than these.<br />\nBut in the last analysis, despite any objections of a practical nature that might be raised against the inauguration of the<br />\nNew Plan as outlined herewith, we are forced to admit that it<br />\niF a gorgeous ideal. We hope that it will become more than that.<br />\nThis week may be the beginning of a new era. It may set<br />\nthe cornerstone of a new search for Truth. Or it may be merely<br />\nthe fiftieth anniversary of an American university. Who will<br />\nventure a guess?<br /><br />\nYES AND NO<br />\nThe Shanghi Gesture<br />\nYou are in New York in, let us say 1880. You are a<br />\nsailor. Having been paid off some four months previously,<br />\nyour money is nearly gone. The necessity of having something to do presents itself in the form of unpaid room rent.<br />\nPicking up whatever clothing you happen to possess, it is<br />\nplunged into a sea-bag and you hie yourself to a waterfront<br />\nbar where there will be talk of ships and sailings ; of skippers<br />\nand bos'ns ; of articles and signing on. But as you pass the<br />\nline at the bar and your eye wanders about the tables in the<br />\nback room, searching in vain for familiar faces. You decide<br />\nthat you are desolately lonely.<br />\nSuddenly the swinging doors break in the middle and four<br />\nof your old shipmates are presented; boisterously happy. One<br />\nis with a clipper ship bound for Rio; another in a four master<br />\nto Sidney, still another to the East in a mail packet. The other<br />\nis going on a trip to the fishing banks that won't amount to<br />\nmuch. Ten minues before you would have welcomed the<br />\nchance to go anywhere. It would have been a pleasure. Now<br />\nwith fair friends bidding you go here and there, you decide to<br />\nbe choosey.<br />\nBut since you have last seen your old buddies they have<br />\nacquired a deep, dark purpose in life. They are now Bos'ils<br />\nfor their respective ship-masters. Their orders are to get you<br />\nat any price.<br />\nBeing a social creature, when they suggest getting a drink<br />\nor two you join them at the bar. Everything goes stilendidly<br />\nfor a while. They talk of their ships with a bit of ,swagger<br />\nand a deal of pride. The .treat is dutch. Being naturally<br />\ncautious you don't drink too much; your head is clear and<br />\nyou have a pretty fair chance to look them all over.<br />\nSo far the game is fair, the odds are about even. You go,<br />\nas a matter of course, to the man you really like best. The<br />\nparty decides to have a friendly poker game in the back-room<br />\nand you are invited to watch them if you so desire. There is<br />\none man you can't help but like, you like his style of play<br />\nand the way he conducts himself in the company of others.<br />\nPerhaps he drops you a word or two about the congeniality<br />\nof his shipmates., of the standing of his shipping cqmpany. In<br />\nthe next day or so you meet some of his bunkies and are, so<br />\nfar as sober judgment will permit, mentally decided that you<br />\nwill take one trip; you like ship, sailors and company.<br />\nBut one day when you are not present the whole group<br />\nget together and decide. on a plan of action.<br />\nThe following day you sense a feeling of unrestraint in<br />\ntheirgreetings. No longer are you asked to be your own<br />\nhost; wine flows freely at no cost to you; also finding that they<br />\nare fairy .folk who drag you about in coaches and money flows<br />\nas freely as the wine. A week wears on. Your head is becoming fuzzy, faces are blurred and that little man on the<br />\nfishing trip is much in evidence. But wassa diff'runce anyway? You are too tired to think and a bit too drunk to<br />\nreason. The little man still buzzes around. S'funny, when<br />\nyou were sober this little man didn't count for much. But<br />\nhe doesn't get far away; never leaves you alone. He holds his<br />\nliquor well too. . . . Getting more tired and drunker. . .<br />\n.Whoozit? ... can't see ... all drunk together ...

One or two by<br />\nchoice. The others don't quite know why. You are sure you<br />\ndon't. If it only hadn't been that one open week! . . . The<br />\nlittle man is not in sight.
