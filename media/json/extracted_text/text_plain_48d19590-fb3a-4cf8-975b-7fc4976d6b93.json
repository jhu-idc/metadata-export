He<br />\nsays that as far as he understands<br />\nit, the men will have a most enjoyable vacation at a rather moderate<br />\ncost. The experience, he says,<br />\nshould prove valuable to a man all<br />\nhis days.

A postal, addressed to Dean Griffin, or even a<br />\nvisiting card, dropped in the Dean's<br />\nbox, Room 13, stating one's desire<br />\nto have his name forwarded to the<br />\nNavy Department's Bureau of Navigation is all that is required.

But yet there are no dead<br />\nor crippled scattered over the field<br />\nof battle. No man is less able to<br />\nsucceed in life because he engaged<br />\nin one of these debates; every man,<br />\nwhether victor or vanquished, has<br />\nsucceeded in some respects, at any<br />\nrate, in increasing his power to<br />\nthink\u2014to think deeply, to think accurately, to think on the spur of the<br />\nmoment. Each debater must have<br />\ngained in self-confidence. The truth<br />\nand beauty of the speeches which the<br />\ndebaters built up with such diffi,culty must serve as a constant in-centive to them to think at all times<br />\nas deeply, and to express every<br />\n.sentence they utter with somethingof the dignity and force with which<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br /><br />\nthey spoke on the nights of their<br />\npublic appearances.<br />\nBut all this might not have been<br />\ntrue.
