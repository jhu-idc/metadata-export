Stockton.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DEC. 19, 1910.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER takes pleasure<br />\nin printing in this issue an authoritative statement from the special<br />\ncommittee appointed by the Athletic Board to consider the financial<br />\nsituation, which shows that conditions are much more satisfactory<br />\nthan the figures first obtained seemed to indicate. The problem of securing an accurate analysis of the<br />\nfigures is fairly complex, and<br />\nis to be regretted that through certain misunderstandings, fears that<br />\nnow appear groundless, regarding<br />\nthe prospects for lacrosse and baseball, should have been raised.<br />\nIn this connection, it should not<br />\nhe forgotten that the trustees are<br />\ndeserving of the gratitude of the<br />\nAthletic Association for generously<br />\nabsolving the Board from. all obligations for payment on the new<br />\nstand this year. With the increased<br />\nprestige of the football team and<br />\nthe growing public interest in Hopkins sports, the Association will<br />\ndorbtless be able to make ample<br />\nreturns to the trustees in the future.<br />\nIt is rumored that Mr. John M.<br />\nHolmes, who has been president of<br />\nthe Athletic Association for some<br />\nsix years, intends to hand in his<br />\nresignation at the next meeting of<br />\nthe Board. THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\njoins the student body in an appeal<br />\nto the Board to refuse to accept<br />\nthe resignation, and to Mr. Holmes<br />\nto reconsider his decision. That<br />\nthe position is a thankless one, and<br />\nthat it involves not only work and<br />\nworry, but tlso lays its occupant<br />\nopen to undeserved criticism from<br />\nunthinking people, we fully realize.<br />\nBut we are convinced that Mr.<br />\nHolmes is the logical man for the<br />\nplace, both because of his experience and ability and because of<br />\nthe uniform tactfulness with which<br />\n<br />\nHow can the undergraduates<br />\nhelp in the present campaign? It<br />\nwould be a great assistance to the<br />\nGeneral Campaign Committee if<br />\nthe undergraduates would make up<br />\na sum to be contributted to the<br />\nEndowment and Extension Fund.<br />\nThis idea, which was briefly set<br />\nforth in last week's NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nis an admirable one. There are<br />\nover one hundred and seventy-five<br />\nstudents at the University, and if<br />\nevery one were to sign a pledge<br />\nfor $6, payable in three instalments,<br />\none 1911, 1912, and 1913, it would<br />\nmean practically a contribution of<br />\na thousand dollars from the University. To show how low an average this is, the General Committee has already received seven<br />\npledges from students at the University totalling in all $270. The<br />\nchief point, however, is that everybody should give something. If<br />\nyou don't think you can afford to<br />\npay $6 in three years, make it half<br />\nthat sum, but be sure to contribute<br />\nsomething. Do not hesitate a moment because the sum you can<br />\npledge seems so small in a large<br />\ncampaign. Everything helps. We<br />\nhave had numerous contributions<br />\nfrom alumni of $5, and some as<br />\nlow as $2. If everyone at the University could see the splendid work<br />\nwhich is being done by the Citizens'<br />\nCommittee, a committee composed<br />\nof men not connected with the<br />\nUniversity in any way, and many<br />\nnot connected with any university,<br />\nit would not but prove a deep inspiration. When prominent men of<br />\nthis type give up several hours of<br />\neach already overcrowded day to<br />\nhelp the University to Homewood,<br />\ncertainly the undergraduates should<br />\nshow their appreciation by swelling the campaign fund at least<br />\n$1,000. Alake it a lump sum<br />\neither from the classes or from the<br />\nundergraduates as a whole. Examination time is always a busy<br />\none, but the Citizens' Committee<br />\nand every other committee is equally busy. The only way to decide<br />\na matter of this kind is to do it.<br />\nH.

These<br />\nflowers are called by the natives,<br />\n\"boot-black\" flowers, from the fact<br />\nthat when they are crushed by rubbing them against one's shoe, they<br />\nproduce a very nice blacking. It<br />\nIs the Hibiscus plant. In places our<br />\nroad led along the seashore, and<br />\ncoral reefs were quite conspicuous,<br />\nfrom the red algae growing so plentifully on them. Along this road, too,<br />\nWe made our first acquaintance with<br />\nthe chocolate tree, the alspice, and<br />\ncalabash tree, with its large gourdlike fruits which grow on the trunk<br />\nand branches, and whose rind is<br />\nsometimes used for cooking utensils<br />\nby the natives.

The problem of securing an accurate analysis of the<br />\nfigures is fairly complex, and<br />\nis to be regretted that through certain misunderstandings, fears that<br />\nnow appear groundless, regarding<br />\nthe prospects for lacrosse and baseball, should have been raised.<br />\nIn this connection, it should not<br />\nhe forgotten that the trustees are<br />\ndeserving of the gratitude of the<br />\nAthletic Association for generously<br />\nabsolving the Board from. all obligations for payment on the new<br />\nstand this year. With the increased<br />\nprestige of the football team and<br />\nthe growing public interest in Hopkins sports, the Association will<br />\ndorbtless be able to make ample<br />\nreturns to the trustees in the future.<br />\nIt is rumored that Mr. John M.<br />\nHolmes, who has been president of<br />\nthe Athletic Association for some<br />\nsix years, intends to hand in his<br />\nresignation at the next meeting of<br />\nthe Board. THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\njoins the student body in an appeal<br />\nto the Board to refuse to accept<br />\nthe resignation, and to Mr. Holmes<br />\nto reconsider his decision. That<br />\nthe position is a thankless one, and<br />\nthat it involves not only work and<br />\nworry, but tlso lays its occupant<br />\nopen to undeserved criticism from<br />\nunthinking people, we fully realize.<br />\nBut we are convinced that Mr.<br />\nHolmes is the logical man for the<br />\nplace, both because of his experience and ability and because of<br />\nthe uniform tactfulness with which<br /><br />\nHow can the undergraduates<br />\nhelp in the present campaign? It<br />\nwould be a great assistance to the<br />\nGeneral Campaign Committee if<br />\nthe undergraduates would make up<br />\na sum to be contributted to the<br />\nEndowment and Extension Fund.<br />\nThis idea, which was briefly set<br />\nforth in last week's NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nis an admirable one. There are<br />\nover one hundred and seventy-five<br />\nstudents at the University, and if<br />\nevery one were to sign a pledge<br />\nfor $6, payable in three instalments,<br />\none 1911, 1912, and 1913, it would<br />\nmean practically a contribution of<br />\na thousand dollars from the University. To show how low an average this is, the General Committee has already received seven<br />\npledges from students at the University totalling in all $270. The<br />\nchief point, however, is that everybody should give something. If<br />\nyou don't think you can afford to<br />\npay $6 in three years, make it half<br />\nthat sum, but be sure to contribute<br />\nsomething. Do not hesitate a moment because the sum you can<br />\npledge seems so small in a large<br />\ncampaign. Everything helps. We<br />\nhave had numerous contributions<br />\nfrom alumni of $5, and some as<br />\nlow as $2. If everyone at the University could see the splendid work<br />\nwhich is being done by the Citizens'<br />\nCommittee, a committee composed<br />\nof men not connected with the<br />\nUniversity in any way, and many<br />\nnot connected with any university,<br />\nit would not but prove a deep inspiration. When prominent men of<br />\nthis type give up several hours of<br />\neach already overcrowded day to<br />\nhelp the University to Homewood,<br />\ncertainly the undergraduates should<br />\nshow their appreciation by swelling the campaign fund at least<br />\n$1,000. Alake it a lump sum<br />\neither from the classes or from the<br />\nundergraduates as a whole. Examination time is always a busy<br />\none, but the Citizens' Committee<br />\nand every other committee is equally busy. The only way to decide<br />\na matter of this kind is to do it.<br />\nH.

R. MIDDLETON AND H. H. YORK<br />\n(Continued from No. 7)<br /><br />\n'We left the reader at the close<br />\nof the last article at the wharf of<br />\nthe United Fruit Company, at Port<br />\nAntonio at about seven o'clock.<br />\nI hanks to the correspondence that<br />\nhad previously been held between<br />\nthe University and the customs<br />\nofficials at Port Antonio, we had<br />\nno trouble whatever with the Customs inspectors (none of us was<br />\nrequired to open his private luggage); and so we soon found ourselves in vehicles that the Jamaicans<br />\ncall \"buggies,\" which were twoseated affairs, each one capable of<br />\nholding four persons. We were<br />\ndriven to the Titchfield Cottages,<br />\nwhere we left our suitcases and<br />\nthen drove out to Blue Hole.<br />\nA greater part of the distance to<br />\nBlue Hole the road was lined on<br />\neither side by hedges of a plant<br />\nWhich was loaded with large<br />\nflowers, some white, some red,<br />\nsome purple, much the form of<br />\nvery large morning glories, except<br />\nthat the pistils and stameRs were<br />\nqtilte large and conspicuous. These<br />\nflowers are called by the natives,<br />\n\"boot-black\" flowers, from the fact<br />\nthat when they are crushed by rubbing them against one's shoe, they<br />\nproduce a very nice blacking. It<br />\nIs the Hibiscus plant. In places our<br />\nroad led along the seashore, and<br />\ncoral reefs were quite conspicuous,<br />\nfrom the red algae growing so plentifully on them. Along this road, too,<br />\nWe made our first acquaintance with<br />\nthe chocolate tree, the alspice, and<br />\ncalabash tree, with its large gourdlike fruits which grow on the trunk<br />\nand branches, and whose rind is<br />\nsometimes used for cooking utensils<br />\nby the natives. It will be remembered that we stated in the first<br />\ninstallment of this article that the<br />\nmountains are quite close to the<br />\nseashore; along this road we saw<br />\nPlaces where the edges of the foothills had been graded away to make<br />\nroom for it. We stopped our teams<br />\nseveral *times to get out and to make<br />\na closer inspection of these, and on<br />\nthe rocks, in damp places, we found<br />\nliverworts and mosses.<br />\nAt one place the road to Blue<br />\nHole crosses a stream of considerable size and here we saw native<br />\nWomen washing clothes.
