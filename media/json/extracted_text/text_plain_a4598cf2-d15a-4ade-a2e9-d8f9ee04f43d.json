No roll is called<br />\nand the entire matter is left entirely to the student who is presupposed to have entered college for the purpose of benefiting himself.<br />\nAs under other systems, there are probably work-dodgers, handshakers, and horseshoe artists at these institutions, but it is just as<br />\nreasonable to believe that the degree which they receive is thoroughly<br />\nearned as it is at a school where similar artists arrange for credit<br />\naccording to the mark system.<br />\nEven if this apprenticeship idea is conceded to have its faults,<br />\nthere is certainly no reason why it should not be applied in some form<br />\nin the last half of the fourth year of a college course. If a student<br />\nhas earned, according to the mark system, seven-eighths of a college<br />\ndegree, then he can certainly be trusted to absorb the other eighth<br />\nwithout the torture of final exams. And no man can sit in a lectureroom for a semester without absorbing the most of his course.

At these<br />\ninstitutions the student is not only free from the strain of exams, but<br />\nis unhindered by the existence of marks of any sort.<br />\nAccording to the Honor System in use at these colleges, the<br />\nstudent is apprenticed to some member of the faculty who is enough<br />\nin touch with his pupil's work to recommend him for a degree upon<br />\nthe completion of the necessary amount of work. No roll is called<br />\nand the entire matter is left entirely to the student who is presupposed to have entered college for the purpose of benefiting himself.<br />\nAs under other systems, there are probably work-dodgers, handshakers, and horseshoe artists at these institutions, but it is just as<br />\nreasonable to believe that the degree which they receive is thoroughly<br />\nearned as it is at a school where similar artists arrange for credit<br />\naccording to the mark system.<br />\nEven if this apprenticeship idea is conceded to have its faults,<br />\nthere is certainly no reason why it should not be applied in some form<br />\nin the last half of the fourth year of a college course. If a student<br />\nhas earned, according to the mark system, seven-eighths of a college<br />\ndegree, then he can certainly be trusted to absorb the other eighth<br />\nwithout the torture of final exams. And no man can sit in a lectureroom for a semester without absorbing the most of his course.
