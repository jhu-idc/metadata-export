The up-Staters<br />\nput up a game fight to the very end,<br />\nbut the superiority of the Hopkins<br />\nteam as a whole told throughout<br />\nthe contest; the hard, consistent<br />\nplunging of the 'Varsity backs,<br />\nsupported by the excellent work of<br />\nthe line, left no doubt in the minds<br />\nof the spectators as to the outcome<br />\nof the contest.<br />\nThe dariip weather and slow field<br />\nrendered open play practically impossible, and the slippery ball was<br />\nthe cause of several fumbles. Forward passes were successful in<br />\nonly two instances, and fumbling<br />\nthroughout the game rendered the<br />\noutcome of plays requiring accurate<br />\npassing a matter of doubt. This<br />\nfeature of the game kept the stands<br />\non edge; there were several times<br />\nduring the contest when the danger<br />\nof loss of the ball caused distinct<br />\nthrills.<br />\n. In spite of the inclement weather<br />\na large crowd was in the stands;<br />\nand, although the attendance was<br />\nnot what had been expected, the<br />\nspirit shown by both stands added<br />\nlife to the affair. Cheering on both<br />\nsides was almost uninterrupted, and<br />\nthe two bands were very much in<br />\nevidence. The Hopkins stand did<br />\nmuch better in its cheering than at<br />\nthe opening game ;- the yells and<br />\nsongs rang out with true fire,- and<br />\nat an especially brilliant play the<br />\nnoise was deafening.<br />\nScoring began immediately following the kick-off. Bowers caught<br />\nthe ball, running it io yards, and,<br />\nafter 2 minutes and 55 seconds of<br />\nsuccessful line plunging, Brooks<br />\ncarried it across the line. Wilkinson kicked a difficult goal. This<br />\nwas the only scoring done in the<br />\nfirst quarter; the second touchdown<br />\nbeing made by Hoffman i minute<br />\nand 50 seconds after the opening ,of<br />\nthe second period. Shortly before<br />\nthe end of the quarter, Garrett, of<br />\nWestern Maryland, tore off on a<br />\nspectacular run of 70 yards through<br />\nthe entire broken field of Hopkins<br />\nplayers and was downed on the<br />\nBlack and Blue's 5-yard line by<br />\nFinney's brilliant tackle. After<br />\nfour attempts the Green and Gold<br />\nscored; Kester failing to kick goal.<br />\nIn the third quarter, two scores<br />\nwere made by Hopkins. Uhler<br />\ntook the ball over both times, and<br />\nPractically all of the ground was<br />\ngained by line plunging. Wilkinson kicked both goals. In the final<br />\nperiod, each team scored once\u2014<br />\n<br />\nAn \u2022 important series of experiments, conducted by Prof. John B.<br />\nWatson and Dr. K. S. Lashley, both<br />\nof the Hopkins psychology department, which has entirely disproved<br />\nseveral old and well-believed theories and has established several<br />\nnew and rather startling facts, has<br />\nbeen in the process of performance<br />\nin the Hopkins laboratories for the<br />\nlast six or eight months.<br />\nThe greater part of this work has<br />\ngone on in a little room just beneath the steps of the biological laboratory. Here there are stacks of<br />\nintricate wire traps, complex mazes<br />\nand electrical globes. In a very<br />\ntiny room adjoining there are hundreds of crawling, squeaking rats.<br />\nThese rats have been the subjects<br />\nof most of the experiments.<br />\nThe most recent experiment conducted in these rooms has had for its<br />\npurpose the determining of the effect which drugs have upon the rate<br />\nof learning. To ascertain this, Mr.<br />\nLashley, who conducted the experiment, fist constructed a wire maze,<br />\ncorresponding in miniature to the<br />\nmazes of Steeple Chase Pier and<br />\nConey Island. The rats were then<br />\ndivided into groups of ten. An<br />\naverage was taken of the number<br />\nof trials required by the members<br />\nof one group after a harmless injection of water to know the way<br />\nfrom the entrance of the maze to<br />\nthe plate of food which formed its<br />\ncenter. Each rat of another group<br />\nwas then given a heavy injection of<br />\nstrychnine, and the -experiment was<br />\nrepeated.<br />\nIt was found that the strychnine<br />\nnearly doubled the \u2022 capacity for<br />\nlearning: The normal number of<br />\ntrials required was 43, but under the<br />\ninfluence of the drug the rat was<br />\nable to find the food after only 24<br />\nattempts. On the other hand, after<br />\nan injection of caffeine, an average<br />\nof 74.4 trials was required.<br />\nAnother interesting series of experiments has been conducted by<br />\nProfessor Watson in the thresholds<br />\nof vision of the chick and the rat.<br />\nThe animal was placed in a closed<br />\nbox, at the extremity of which lights<br />\nwere exhibited, and records were<br />\ntaken of the farthest points at which<br />\nthe lights were visible to the subject.. Experiments were also undertaken in the distinguishing of<br />\nlights of different colors. It was<br />\nproved that the chick's threshold<br />\nof vision is practically the same as<br />\nman's and that he has a color vision,<br />\nwhile the rat is color blind.<br />\nThese _experiments have been undertaken to ascertain two things:<br />\n<br />\nBy COACH CHARLES E.

His acceptance was in the form of a letter to<br />\nGeneral Murray Vandiver, chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee, in which he stated<br />\nthat he was greatly interested in the<br />\nmovement and took great pleasure<br />\nin becoming associated with it.<br />\nDr. Goodnow thinks that important work can be accomplished before the meeting of the Legislature,<br />\nat which time a commission can be<br />\nselected representing the State, and,<br />\narmed with the necessary power to<br />\nact, to which the present commission can turn over the results of its<br />\nwork. The present commission, he<br />\nsays, will work under the difficulty<br />\nof lacking authority and funds.<br />\nIn his letter to General Vandiver,<br />\nPresident Goodnow states that the<br />\nabove-named difficulties are so serious as to make it probable that the<br />\ncommission will be unable to do all<br />\nof the work expected of it. He<br />\nsays, regarding the work of the<br />\ncommission: \"If it should fail to<br />\nmeet public expectations I fear that<br />\nthe movement for economy and efficiency would be so prejudiced that<br />\nit would be seriously retarded, if<br />\nnot not absolutely arrested.\"<br />\nMany people think that Dr. Goodnow's acceptance of the chairmanship of the commission is one of the<br />\nmost significant occurrences in the<br />\npolitics of this State in many<br />\nyears. To quote from the Sun of<br />\nOctober 17:<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"The general feeling today<br />\nthat<br />\nDr. Goodnow, a man who has given<br />\nhis life to study of the science of<br />\ngovernment, is the man to take the<br />\nlead in reorganizing the State's<br />\nmachinery strongly suggests that a<br />\nnew idea is taking hold of the<br />\npeople.<br />\n\"Then, there is Dr. Goodnow's<br />\nwillingness to work. He could have<br />\nfound a good many reasons for refusing. He might have backed off<br />\nfor fear that it would prejudice his<br />\nwork as president of Hopkins; he<br />\nmight have declined because the<br />\ncommission was named by a political party\u2014and it happens that he<br />\nhas been a Republican in national<br />\naffairs. But no! He refused to see<br />\nthe lions in the way; or, if he saw<br />\nthem, he. refused to be frightened.<br />\nHe took hold and,bearing in mind<br />\nthe high character and the ability<br />\nof the other members of the commission the State has assurance that<br />\nsomething real is to be done in<br />\nmodernizing.\"<br />\n<br />\nFrom the standpoint of the<br />\ncoaches, Saturday's game with<br />\nWestern Maryland was a very interesting one, as it gave a fine opportunity to size up the ability of<br />\nthe Hopkins men, playing for the<br />\nfirst time under pressure. It was a<br />\ncase of Hopkins with a heavier<br />\nteam playing simple football against<br />\na desperate, fighting eleven with<br />\na varied attack and a good defense,<br />\nespecially its secondary defense.<br />\nHopkins won by a large score<br />\nbecause its powerful attack was not<br />\nto be denied. As I said before,<br />\nWestern Maryland had a good defense, but it was soon worn out by<br />\nthe constant tearing and plunging<br />\nof the Hopkins backfield. It pleased<br />\nMr. Brennick and myself to see that<br />\nthe team could make their simple<br />\nattack go, for in the games to come<br />\nthis simple attack will, of course,<br />\ngive way to a much more varied<br />\none. But I wanted the men to learn<br />\nthe value of straight, simple football first.<br />\nThe defensive work\u2022of\u2022 the Hopkins team was, on the whole, fair;<br />\nconsidering the variety of their opponent's attack. 'Western Maryland had a well-drilled team and<br />\nexecuted its plays in a clever manner, which made quick thinking on<br />\nthe part of the defense very essential. With two or three exceptions,<br />\nthe men sized up the plays of Western Maryland very well. The unfortunate part of it was that the<br />\ntimes they failed to diagnose the<br />\nplays resulted practically in touchdowns for the opponents.<br />\nHopkins would have scored at<br />\nleast two more touchdowns had it<br />\nnot been for penalties and fumbles.<br />\nIn both games so far the officials<br />\nseemed to delight in penalizing<br />\nHopkins during the early part of<br />\nthe game, and then in the second<br />\nhalf to exert all their efforts in<br />\npenalizing the other teams. As for<br />\nfumbles, Saturday was just made<br />\nto order. The ball was very slippery and hard to handle; but a<br />\ngood team must learn to play on a<br />\nwet field.<br />\nNext Saturday should see great<br />\nimprovement in every department<br />\nof play on the part of Hopkins.<br />\nThe men have passed through the<br />\nvery crude period and should now<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 18, 1915.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nDIFFICULT<br />\n<br />\nMORE PUBLICITY FOR HONORS<br />\n<br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS DESIRE TRIPS<br />\n<br />\nPublic Opinion Seems to Demand Constitutional Monarchy, Says Pres.Goodnow\u2014Crown May Be Forced<br />\non Yuan Shi Kai.<br />\n<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa Not Appreciated by<br />\nFreshmen Until Too Late, Says<br />\nDr. French\u2014More Should<br />\nBe Said About Prizes.<br />\n<br />\nManagement Offers Five Dollars to Students Securing Outside Engagements\u2014Rehearsals to Begin<br />\nThis Week.<br />\n<br />\nCHINESE SITUATION<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

It is unfortunately true<br />\nthat many first-year men, not fully<br />\nrealizing the importance and exact<br />\nnature of the academic honors attainable during the four years of<br />\ncollege, allow their first year's work<br />\nto slip by without making a serious<br />\neffort toward high standing, and<br />\nthus suffer an irretrievable loss,<br />\nwhich they regret upon becoming<br />\naware of the fact that they did<br />\nhave the opportunity to distinguish<br />\nthemselves. THE NEWS - LETTER<br />\nhopes, both through the interview<br />\nwith Dr. French published in this<br />\nissue and through this editorial, to<br />\nbring the matter before the members of the Class of 1919 in a manner which will cause them to think<br />\nseriously of the question, and which<br />\nmay bring many who had not<br />\n<br />\nKeep Up Your Spirit!<br />\n<br />\nOur Advertisers.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER takes this opportunity to ask every student of<br />\nthe University to do his buying, as<br />\nfar as possible, at the shops and<br />\nwith the firms represented by advertisements in these columns. As<br />\nan activity devoted solely to the interests of Hopkins and Hopkins<br />\nmen, THE NEWS-LETTER is entirely<br />\ndependent upon student support for<br />\nits existence, and a most important<br />\npart of this support consists of<br />\nshowing the advertisers that it is<br />\nworth while for them to pay for<br />\nspace. This can be done only<br />\nthrough consistent patronage of the<br />\nadvertisers by the students.<br />\nFrom time to time throughout<br />\nthe year special inducements in the<br />\nform of sales check contests will<br />\nbe offered in order to make the<br />\npatronage of advertisers profitable<br />\nto the student. As a matter of fact,<br />\nthis means of bringing Hopkins<br />\nmen to support THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nought not to be necessary; the support should come out of a desire to<br />\ndo everything possible to make our<br />\nactivities successful, but the contests for prizes are held notwithstanding for the purpose of creating a more widespread interest in<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nWhenever you are about to make<br />\na purchase of any kind, stop a moment to find out whether it is not<br />\npossible for you to get what you<br />\nwant from a firm advertising in<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, and if you find<br />\nthat you can, go to one of the firms<br />\nwhose name you will find on our<br />\nlist of advertisers. You will discover that in most cases better satisfaction can be obtained through so<br />\ndoing, and that in every case you<br />\ncan get exactly what you want.<br />\nNever fail to leave a pink slip with<br />\nthe salesman.

The up-Staters<br />\nput up a game fight to the very end,<br />\nbut the superiority of the Hopkins<br />\nteam as a whole told throughout<br />\nthe contest; the hard, consistent<br />\nplunging of the 'Varsity backs,<br />\nsupported by the excellent work of<br />\nthe line, left no doubt in the minds<br />\nof the spectators as to the outcome<br />\nof the contest.<br />\nThe dariip weather and slow field<br />\nrendered open play practically impossible, and the slippery ball was<br />\nthe cause of several fumbles. Forward passes were successful in<br />\nonly two instances, and fumbling<br />\nthroughout the game rendered the<br />\noutcome of plays requiring accurate<br />\npassing a matter of doubt. This<br />\nfeature of the game kept the stands<br />\non edge; there were several times<br />\nduring the contest when the danger<br />\nof loss of the ball caused distinct<br />\nthrills.<br />\n. In spite of the inclement weather<br />\na large crowd was in the stands;<br />\nand, although the attendance was<br />\nnot what had been expected, the<br />\nspirit shown by both stands added<br />\nlife to the affair. Cheering on both<br />\nsides was almost uninterrupted, and<br />\nthe two bands were very much in<br />\nevidence. The Hopkins stand did<br />\nmuch better in its cheering than at<br />\nthe opening game ;- the yells and<br />\nsongs rang out with true fire,- and<br />\nat an especially brilliant play the<br />\nnoise was deafening.<br />\nScoring began immediately following the kick-off. Bowers caught<br />\nthe ball, running it io yards, and,<br />\nafter 2 minutes and 55 seconds of<br />\nsuccessful line plunging, Brooks<br />\ncarried it across the line. Wilkinson kicked a difficult goal. This<br />\nwas the only scoring done in the<br />\nfirst quarter; the second touchdown<br />\nbeing made by Hoffman i minute<br />\nand 50 seconds after the opening ,of<br />\nthe second period. Shortly before<br />\nthe end of the quarter, Garrett, of<br />\nWestern Maryland, tore off on a<br />\nspectacular run of 70 yards through<br />\nthe entire broken field of Hopkins<br />\nplayers and was downed on the<br />\nBlack and Blue's 5-yard line by<br />\nFinney's brilliant tackle. After<br />\nfour attempts the Green and Gold<br />\nscored; Kester failing to kick goal.<br />\nIn the third quarter, two scores<br />\nwere made by Hopkins. Uhler<br />\ntook the ball over both times, and<br />\nPractically all of the ground was<br />\ngained by line plunging. Wilkinson kicked both goals. In the final<br />\nperiod, each team scored once\u2014<br /><br />\nAn \u2022 important series of experiments, conducted by Prof. John B.<br />\nWatson and Dr. K. S. Lashley, both<br />\nof the Hopkins psychology department, which has entirely disproved<br />\nseveral old and well-believed theories and has established several<br />\nnew and rather startling facts, has<br />\nbeen in the process of performance<br />\nin the Hopkins laboratories for the<br />\nlast six or eight months.<br />\nThe greater part of this work has<br />\ngone on in a little room just beneath the steps of the biological laboratory. Here there are stacks of<br />\nintricate wire traps, complex mazes<br />\nand electrical globes. In a very<br />\ntiny room adjoining there are hundreds of crawling, squeaking rats.<br />\nThese rats have been the subjects<br />\nof most of the experiments.<br />\nThe most recent experiment conducted in these rooms has had for its<br />\npurpose the determining of the effect which drugs have upon the rate<br />\nof learning. To ascertain this, Mr.<br />\nLashley, who conducted the experiment, fist constructed a wire maze,<br />\ncorresponding in miniature to the<br />\nmazes of Steeple Chase Pier and<br />\nConey Island. The rats were then<br />\ndivided into groups of ten. An<br />\naverage was taken of the number<br />\nof trials required by the members<br />\nof one group after a harmless injection of water to know the way<br />\nfrom the entrance of the maze to<br />\nthe plate of food which formed its<br />\ncenter. Each rat of another group<br />\nwas then given a heavy injection of<br />\nstrychnine, and the -experiment was<br />\nrepeated.<br />\nIt was found that the strychnine<br />\nnearly doubled the \u2022 capacity for<br />\nlearning: The normal number of<br />\ntrials required was 43, but under the<br />\ninfluence of the drug the rat was<br />\nable to find the food after only 24<br />\nattempts. On the other hand, after<br />\nan injection of caffeine, an average<br />\nof 74.4 trials was required.<br />\nAnother interesting series of experiments has been conducted by<br />\nProfessor Watson in the thresholds<br />\nof vision of the chick and the rat.<br />\nThe animal was placed in a closed<br />\nbox, at the extremity of which lights<br />\nwere exhibited, and records were<br />\ntaken of the farthest points at which<br />\nthe lights were visible to the subject.. Experiments were also undertaken in the distinguishing of<br />\nlights of different colors. It was<br />\nproved that the chick's threshold<br />\nof vision is practically the same as<br />\nman's and that he has a color vision,<br />\nwhile the rat is color blind.<br />\nThese _experiments have been undertaken to ascertain two things:<br /><br />\nBy COACH CHARLES E.

His acceptance was in the form of a letter to<br />\nGeneral Murray Vandiver, chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee, in which he stated<br />\nthat he was greatly interested in the<br />\nmovement and took great pleasure<br />\nin becoming associated with it.<br />\nDr. Goodnow thinks that important work can be accomplished before the meeting of the Legislature,<br />\nat which time a commission can be<br />\nselected representing the State, and,<br />\narmed with the necessary power to<br />\nact, to which the present commission can turn over the results of its<br />\nwork. The present commission, he<br />\nsays, will work under the difficulty<br />\nof lacking authority and funds.<br />\nIn his letter to General Vandiver,<br />\nPresident Goodnow states that the<br />\nabove-named difficulties are so serious as to make it probable that the<br />\ncommission will be unable to do all<br />\nof the work expected of it. He<br />\nsays, regarding the work of the<br />\ncommission: \"If it should fail to<br />\nmeet public expectations I fear that<br />\nthe movement for economy and efficiency would be so prejudiced that<br />\nit would be seriously retarded, if<br />\nnot not absolutely arrested.\"<br />\nMany people think that Dr. Goodnow's acceptance of the chairmanship of the commission is one of the<br />\nmost significant occurrences in the<br />\npolitics of this State in many<br />\nyears. To quote from the Sun of<br />\nOctober 17:<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"The general feeling today<br />\nthat<br />\nDr. Goodnow, a man who has given<br />\nhis life to study of the science of<br />\ngovernment, is the man to take the<br />\nlead in reorganizing the State's<br />\nmachinery strongly suggests that a<br />\nnew idea is taking hold of the<br />\npeople.<br />\n\"Then, there is Dr. Goodnow's<br />\nwillingness to work. He could have<br />\nfound a good many reasons for refusing. He might have backed off<br />\nfor fear that it would prejudice his<br />\nwork as president of Hopkins; he<br />\nmight have declined because the<br />\ncommission was named by a political party\u2014and it happens that he<br />\nhas been a Republican in national<br />\naffairs. But no! He refused to see<br />\nthe lions in the way; or, if he saw<br />\nthem, he. refused to be frightened.<br />\nHe took hold and,bearing in mind<br />\nthe high character and the ability<br />\nof the other members of the commission the State has assurance that<br />\nsomething real is to be done in<br />\nmodernizing.\"<br /><br />\nFrom the standpoint of the<br />\ncoaches, Saturday's game with<br />\nWestern Maryland was a very interesting one, as it gave a fine opportunity to size up the ability of<br />\nthe Hopkins men, playing for the<br />\nfirst time under pressure. It was a<br />\ncase of Hopkins with a heavier<br />\nteam playing simple football against<br />\na desperate, fighting eleven with<br />\na varied attack and a good defense,<br />\nespecially its secondary defense.<br />\nHopkins won by a large score<br />\nbecause its powerful attack was not<br />\nto be denied. As I said before,<br />\nWestern Maryland had a good defense, but it was soon worn out by<br />\nthe constant tearing and plunging<br />\nof the Hopkins backfield. It pleased<br />\nMr. Brennick and myself to see that<br />\nthe team could make their simple<br />\nattack go, for in the games to come<br />\nthis simple attack will, of course,<br />\ngive way to a much more varied<br />\none. But I wanted the men to learn<br />\nthe value of straight, simple football first.<br />\nThe defensive work\u2022of\u2022 the Hopkins team was, on the whole, fair;<br />\nconsidering the variety of their opponent's attack. 'Western Maryland had a well-drilled team and<br />\nexecuted its plays in a clever manner, which made quick thinking on<br />\nthe part of the defense very essential. With two or three exceptions,<br />\nthe men sized up the plays of Western Maryland very well. The unfortunate part of it was that the<br />\ntimes they failed to diagnose the<br />\nplays resulted practically in touchdowns for the opponents.<br />\nHopkins would have scored at<br />\nleast two more touchdowns had it<br />\nnot been for penalties and fumbles.<br />\nIn both games so far the officials<br />\nseemed to delight in penalizing<br />\nHopkins during the early part of<br />\nthe game, and then in the second<br />\nhalf to exert all their efforts in<br />\npenalizing the other teams. As for<br />\nfumbles, Saturday was just made<br />\nto order. The ball was very slippery and hard to handle; but a<br />\ngood team must learn to play on a<br />\nwet field.<br />\nNext Saturday should see great<br />\nimprovement in every department<br />\nof play on the part of Hopkins.<br />\nThe men have passed through the<br />\nvery crude period and should now<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 18, 1915.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nDIFFICULT<br /><br />\nMORE PUBLICITY FOR HONORS<br /><br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS DESIRE TRIPS<br /><br />\nPublic Opinion Seems to Demand Constitutional Monarchy, Says Pres.Goodnow\u2014Crown May Be Forced<br />\non Yuan Shi Kai.<br /><br />\nPhi Beta Kappa Not Appreciated by<br />\nFreshmen Until Too Late, Says<br />\nDr. French\u2014More Should<br />\nBe Said About Prizes.<br /><br />\nManagement Offers Five Dollars to Students Securing Outside Engagements\u2014Rehearsals to Begin<br />\nThis Week.<br /><br />\nCHINESE SITUATION<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

It is unfortunately true<br />\nthat many first-year men, not fully<br />\nrealizing the importance and exact<br />\nnature of the academic honors attainable during the four years of<br />\ncollege, allow their first year's work<br />\nto slip by without making a serious<br />\neffort toward high standing, and<br />\nthus suffer an irretrievable loss,<br />\nwhich they regret upon becoming<br />\naware of the fact that they did<br />\nhave the opportunity to distinguish<br />\nthemselves. THE NEWS - LETTER<br />\nhopes, both through the interview<br />\nwith Dr. French published in this<br />\nissue and through this editorial, to<br />\nbring the matter before the members of the Class of 1919 in a manner which will cause them to think<br />\nseriously of the question, and which<br />\nmay bring many who had not<br /><br />\nKeep Up Your Spirit!<br /><br />\nOur Advertisers.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER takes this opportunity to ask every student of<br />\nthe University to do his buying, as<br />\nfar as possible, at the shops and<br />\nwith the firms represented by advertisements in these columns. As<br />\nan activity devoted solely to the interests of Hopkins and Hopkins<br />\nmen, THE NEWS-LETTER is entirely<br />\ndependent upon student support for<br />\nits existence, and a most important<br />\npart of this support consists of<br />\nshowing the advertisers that it is<br />\nworth while for them to pay for<br />\nspace. This can be done only<br />\nthrough consistent patronage of the<br />\nadvertisers by the students.<br />\nFrom time to time throughout<br />\nthe year special inducements in the<br />\nform of sales check contests will<br />\nbe offered in order to make the<br />\npatronage of advertisers profitable<br />\nto the student. As a matter of fact,<br />\nthis means of bringing Hopkins<br />\nmen to support THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nought not to be necessary; the support should come out of a desire to<br />\ndo everything possible to make our<br />\nactivities successful, but the contests for prizes are held notwithstanding for the purpose of creating a more widespread interest in<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nWhenever you are about to make<br />\na purchase of any kind, stop a moment to find out whether it is not<br />\npossible for you to get what you<br />\nwant from a firm advertising in<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, and if you find<br />\nthat you can, go to one of the firms<br />\nwhose name you will find on our<br />\nlist of advertisers.
