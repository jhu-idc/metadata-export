Their reduction<br />\nof a five-dollar fine to one dollar shows a lack of bitter fraternity feeling which is commendable, but, viewing the action<br />\nfrom other angles, the NEWS-LETTER is doubtful as to whether<br />\nthe policy is a wise one.<br />\nWhat is significant in the reduction is that it was not a<br />\nspontaneous display of generosity in a special instance, but a<br />\nconsistent folloWing out of a policy which has been pursued all<br />\nyear. Three times this fall, fraternities have been duly convicted of a breach of the Rushing Agreement, and in all three<br />\ncases the fines have reached the staggering amount of a dollar.<br />\nNo one need be surprised at the results. Punishment by<br />\nthe Board has assumed a somewhat farcical nature, and this<br />\nin turn leads to hasty convictions. For, Ns/lien the punishment<br />\nis so light, an accused fraternity is convicted on trivial grounds<br />\nwithout causing the jury of its peers much mental exertion in<br />\nconsidering the case. If conviction is regarded as a blot on<br />\nthe 'scutcheon, such liasty verdicts are had; if it comes to be<br />\npractically disregarded, matters are worse.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER IS in. favor of bigger fines.<br />\nJ. H. J.<br />\n<br />\nSEASON'S GREETINGS<br />\nToday this column should be draped with holly; it should<br />\nbe printed in green ink with red borders. But since our<br />\nprinter cannot cope with our orders in this particular respect,<br />\nwe have to do without, and wish all of our readers, both constant and casual, a very merry Christmas and an exceedingly<br />\nprosperous New Year in cold, colorless print.<br />\nOur heart overflows with righteous and perfectly legal<br />\nspirits. The tang of the season is in the air; the crowds on the<br />\ndownton streets remind one of the approaching holidays, and<br />\nthe vacant, longing expression of the students heralds the<br />\nexpected advent of a short vacation. We feel at peace with the<br />\nworld.<br />\nIf we keep up at this pace much longer, the leading ladies'<br />\npublications will be on our trail to write seasonal leaders for<br />\nthem. We are so darn mellow that we almost weep at the<br />\nthought of any distraction that would interfere with our jovial<br />\nmood. So we shudder at the idea of studies, and add to our<br />\nwishes: A holiday free from work of any sort, kind or description.<br />\nTo all of our subscribers, and any others who feel as if<br />\nthey could stand it, we extend our very best wishes for a merry<br />\nChristmas and a happy New Year. In fact, we repeat that wish<br />\nfor the third time: Pleasant holiday to all!<br />\n<br />\nFrom our outside-looking-in viewpoint, we can't help marvelling at the importance that 0. D. K. attaches to class offices.<br />\nTo have been a class officer is a real distinction in the eyes of<br />\nthat influential body. Or, we are very much mistaken.<br />\nThat such an attitude toward .class honors is the heighth of<br />\nthe absurd becomes plain if one reduces it to fact in a simple<br />\nstatement. Take, for example \"Smith is a real man. Why,<br />\nhe's vice-president of his class!\" Again: \"If Brown hasn't a<br />\nlot of ability, why did his class elect him president? Answer<br />\nme that!\" Or: \"Sure, he's very popular with those who know<br />\nhim. He was secretary of his class in his junior year!\"<br />\nIs anyone ever guilty of such remarks? Certainly not,\u2014<br />\nexcept freshmen, and alumni in their dotage. What we actually<br />\nhear are such remarks as these: \"Yeah, some Mu Cow Mu'll be<br />\npresident.\" \"Oh, one of the Engineers is sure to get that job.\"<br />\n\"Of course, everybody admits that he's the best man; but do<br />\nyou think there's any use for him to run?\" \"The hell he will<br />\nhe secretary! Why, he's a damned Jew!\" \"One of those -locals is sure to get treasurer!\" And so on, and so forth,<br />\nad nauseam.<br />\nAfter all, what difference does it make?\u2022 With the unfortunate exception of the treasurer, the functions and duties of<br />\nany given class officer are so simple ,any child can play them<br />\n(italics ours). We have yet to hear a discussion of whether<br />\nso-iand-so was, or will be., a \"good\" or \"bad\" class officer.<br />\nAnd yet class honors have found favor in the eyes of the<br />\nHopkins campus, and, in particular, in the voice of its glorified mouthpiece, Omicron Delta Kappa. The reason is hard<br />\nto find. Perhaps it is an outgrown convention of the good old<br />\ncollege days when men were men. Perhaps it is the persistence of a kotowing habit, acquired to excess in our high school<br />\ndays. More than likely, however, it is an atavism dating from<br />\nour early worship of the Rover Boys.<br />\n<br />\nGET UP AND BOW<br />\n<br />\n(Cont. from p. 1, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\ninstrument for carrying on the<br />\naffairs of Europe.<br />\nGreat Britain has also 'thrown<br />\nin her lot with the continental nations and is risking her empire<br />\nupon the power of the League of<br />\nNations.

Their reduction<br />\nof a five-dollar fine to one dollar shows a lack of bitter fraternity feeling which is commendable, but, viewing the action<br />\nfrom other angles, the NEWS-LETTER is doubtful as to whether<br />\nthe policy is a wise one.<br />\nWhat is significant in the reduction is that it was not a<br />\nspontaneous display of generosity in a special instance, but a<br />\nconsistent folloWing out of a policy which has been pursued all<br />\nyear. Three times this fall, fraternities have been duly convicted of a breach of the Rushing Agreement, and in all three<br />\ncases the fines have reached the staggering amount of a dollar.<br />\nNo one need be surprised at the results. Punishment by<br />\nthe Board has assumed a somewhat farcical nature, and this<br />\nin turn leads to hasty convictions. For, Ns/lien the punishment<br />\nis so light, an accused fraternity is convicted on trivial grounds<br />\nwithout causing the jury of its peers much mental exertion in<br />\nconsidering the case. If conviction is regarded as a blot on<br />\nthe 'scutcheon, such liasty verdicts are had; if it comes to be<br />\npractically disregarded, matters are worse.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER IS in. favor of bigger fines.<br />\nJ. H. J.<br /><br />\nSEASON'S GREETINGS<br />\nToday this column should be draped with holly; it should<br />\nbe printed in green ink with red borders. But since our<br />\nprinter cannot cope with our orders in this particular respect,<br />\nwe have to do without, and wish all of our readers, both constant and casual, a very merry Christmas and an exceedingly<br />\nprosperous New Year in cold, colorless print.<br />\nOur heart overflows with righteous and perfectly legal<br />\nspirits. The tang of the season is in the air; the crowds on the<br />\ndownton streets remind one of the approaching holidays, and<br />\nthe vacant, longing expression of the students heralds the<br />\nexpected advent of a short vacation. We feel at peace with the<br />\nworld.<br />\nIf we keep up at this pace much longer, the leading ladies'<br />\npublications will be on our trail to write seasonal leaders for<br />\nthem. We are so darn mellow that we almost weep at the<br />\nthought of any distraction that would interfere with our jovial<br />\nmood. So we shudder at the idea of studies, and add to our<br />\nwishes: A holiday free from work of any sort, kind or description.<br />\nTo all of our subscribers, and any others who feel as if<br />\nthey could stand it, we extend our very best wishes for a merry<br />\nChristmas and a happy New Year. In fact, we repeat that wish<br />\nfor the third time: Pleasant holiday to all!<br /><br />\nFrom our outside-looking-in viewpoint, we can't help marvelling at the importance that 0. D. K. attaches to class offices.<br />\nTo have been a class officer is a real distinction in the eyes of<br />\nthat influential body. Or, we are very much mistaken.<br />\nThat such an attitude toward .class honors is the heighth of<br />\nthe absurd becomes plain if one reduces it to fact in a simple<br />\nstatement. Take, for example \"Smith is a real man. Why,<br />\nhe's vice-president of his class!\" Again: \"If Brown hasn't a<br />\nlot of ability, why did his class elect him president? Answer<br />\nme that!\" Or: \"Sure, he's very popular with those who know<br />\nhim. He was secretary of his class in his junior year!\"<br />\nIs anyone ever guilty of such remarks? Certainly not,\u2014<br />\nexcept freshmen, and alumni in their dotage. What we actually<br />\nhear are such remarks as these: \"Yeah, some Mu Cow Mu'll be<br />\npresident.\" \"Oh, one of the Engineers is sure to get that job.\"<br />\n\"Of course, everybody admits that he's the best man; but do<br />\nyou think there's any use for him to run?\" \"The hell he will<br />\nhe secretary! Why, he's a damned Jew!\" \"One of those -locals is sure to get treasurer!\" And so on, and so forth,<br />\nad nauseam.<br />\nAfter all, what difference does it make?\u2022 With the unfortunate exception of the treasurer, the functions and duties of<br />\nany given class officer are so simple ,any child can play them<br />\n(italics ours). We have yet to hear a discussion of whether<br />\nso-iand-so was, or will be., a \"good\" or \"bad\" class officer.<br />\nAnd yet class honors have found favor in the eyes of the<br />\nHopkins campus, and, in particular, in the voice of its glorified mouthpiece, Omicron Delta Kappa. The reason is hard<br />\nto find. Perhaps it is an outgrown convention of the good old<br />\ncollege days when men were men. Perhaps it is the persistence of a kotowing habit, acquired to excess in our high school<br />\ndays. More than likely, however, it is an atavism dating from<br />\nour early worship of the Rover Boys.<br /><br />\nGET UP AND BOW<br /><br />\n(Cont. from p. 1, col. 2)<br /><br />\ninstrument for carrying on the<br />\naffairs of Europe.<br />\nGreat Britain has also 'thrown<br />\nin her lot with the continental nations and is risking her empire<br />\nupon the power of the League of<br />\nNations.
