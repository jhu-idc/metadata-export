The primary objective<br />\nof this campaign is to raise funds to improve<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nOne would expect students of the University to fully support such an endeavor, since<br />\nat the conclusion, students will be the<br />\nprimary beneficiaries. Student aid, research,<br />\ninstrumentation, and faculty and program<br />\nsupport are among the areas to which funds<br />\nshould be committed.<br />\nWhat is surprising is the feeling of alienation which many students feel regarding the<br />\nentire occasion. They feel they are being excluded; only a small percentage of the student population will be included in the<br />\nfestivities. They feel they are being kept off<br />\ntheir campus; the upper and lower quads are<br />\nbeing fenced off for the evening and locks<br />\non Homewood buildings are being changed<br />\nfor the weekend. In general, the students of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University feel they don't<br />\ncount, or that the University is ashamed of<br />\nthem.<br />\nThis perception is disturbing. Reasonably,<br />\nmost annoyances could be resolved in<br />\nstudents' minds. It would be extremely im-<br />\n<br />\npractical for the University to allow 3000 +<br />\nstudents to participate in the evening's activities, while at the same time entertaining<br />\napproximately 1000 potential donors. The<br />\nfencing and lock changes will enable a more<br />\neffective security system. Alternative events<br />\nare being planned under the auspices of the<br />\nstudent council, so that students will have<br />\nentertainment for the evening.<br />\nYet, the students should not have to decide<br />\nfor themselves that the agenda for Saturday<br />\nnight is the most practical. That point should<br />\nhave been made clear by the administration.<br />\nA general letter was issued by President<br />\nMuller to all students outlining the conditions involved in the Saturday extravaganza. This letter would have been the perfect<br />\nopportunity to explain to students exactly<br />\nwhy they were not invited and why certain<br />\nprecautions were being taken. Had the letter been composed with a more cordial tone,<br />\nand students been requested to cooperate instead of being told there would be\"no access,\" it would have had a more supportive<br />\nreception. Instead, the letter served to irritate<br />\nstudents, since it was written in a rather cold<br />\nand formal manner.<br />\nStudents; despite all rumors to the contrary, are people and deserve to be treated<br />\nas such. It seems the administration must be<br />\nreminded of this fact.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nStudent Frustration<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYou can't help but feel a lot<br />\nof frustration as you hear about<br />\nthe numerous examples of the<br />\nadministration excluding student participation in so many<br />\nareas of the workings of the<br />\nUniversity. In last week's NewsLetter, for example, we read<br />\nabout the Student Council's<br />\ndead-end attempt to express<br />\nstudent interest and initiative<br />\nfor the new Capitol Campaign.<br />\nThey heard answers like: the<br />\nadministration had decided<br />\nthere is no student interest, and<br />\nthe fact that students may feel<br />\nthat the MSE library is a prime<br />\ncandidate for increased funding<br />\nwas not, is not, and will not be<br />\nan important factor in the<br />\nallocations process. Of course<br />\nthere is also the obvious sham<br />\nbeing perpetrated on WJHU.<br />\nThe whole situation becomes<br />\nespecially insulting (yet almost<br />\namusing) when we hear administrators delivering their<br />\nspeeches on how students can<br />\nand should accept adult responsibilities, show initiative,<br />\nmanage themselves, work<br />\ntowards change, put in, put<br />\nout, grow up, etc.<br />\nAs a freshman, I had a show<br />\non WJHU, and was very involved with the station. I worked hard\u2014but not nearly as hard<br />\n<br />\nas so many other people who<br />\nmade the station happen\u2014from<br />\nkeeping the equipment in top<br />\nworking order and playing<br />\nmusic for every taste, to a<br />\nsignificant news operation and<br />\ncoverage of every home and<br />\naway lacrosse game. Professionalism is not too strong a<br />\nword for what the students and<br />\nmany community members\u2014<br />\nalmost all volunteers\u2014had<br />\nachieved. They built the<br />\nstudios, established contacts<br />\nwith record companies, provided community services and<br />\nbroadcast music that wasn't the<br />\ntight-rotation, top 14 commercial songs. For several years<br />\nnow, the station members have<br />\npursued the application for a<br />\npower increase (from 10 to<br />\n25,000 watts), working closely<br />\nwith the FCC and making<br />\ntechnical and programming<br />\npreparations. The administration received feedback and<br />\nissued instructions through the<br />\nmember-elected Managing<br />\nBoard<br />\nhired<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\nsecretary/office manager. The<br />\ncommunity was pleased and<br />\nsatisfied\u2014number one station<br />\nin Baltimore is no small<br />\nhonor\u2014and the station<br />\nmembers did a good job and<br />\nreceived valuable experience,<br />\nyet the administration didn't<br />\nsee fit to treat these people with<br />\ncommon dignity when they<br />\nsummarily shut down the sta-<br />\n<br />\ntion or mysteriously decided to<br />\nwait for 'green' students before<br />\nestablishing a new, top-down,<br />\nmanagerial hierarchy. I would<br />\nlike to pose an open question to<br />\nPresident Muller and the administration, the faculty, Student Council and student body:<br />\nIs there any reason why WJHU<br />\ncan't resume operation this<br />\nsemester, allowing the students<br />\nand community members to<br />\nreap the many benefits it has to<br />\noffer?<br />\n<br />\nIt came as a great disappointment to me to learn of the sad<br />\nfate of WJHU, the studentoperated radio station of the<br />\nUniversity. From the facts<br />\npresented in the News-Letter I<br />\ngather that the administration<br />\nneglected to give any thought to<br />\nthe future of WJHU when<br />\nplanning the renovation of<br />\nAMR II. Now that the station<br />\nhas been forced into a lengthy<br />\nperiod of inactivity, the school<br />\nis moving ever so slowly<br />\ntowards finding a new home for<br />\ncampus radio, and with a plan<br />\nthat can best be called illadvised. I challenge the administration to reevalute its objectives, and choose a course of<br />\naction that would allow WJHU<br />\nto remain a true college radio<br />\nstation.<br />\nWhat was most disheartening<br />\nto me is the administration's<br />\ndecision to appoint a professional manager for WJHU. I<br />\ncannot help but disagree with<br />\nB.J. Norris, Vice President of<br />\nCommunications and Publicity, when she insists that there<br />\nwill be plenty of room for student participation despite this<br />\nappointment. Professional station managers do not run college radio stations. Instead,<br />\nthey manage facilities whose<br />\npersonnel have primary responsibilities to the operation of the<br />\nstation. Our students have a<br />\nprimary responsibility to their<br />\nschoolwork. This leads me to<br />\nsuspect that the University is<br />\npreparing to move beyond the<br />\nrealm of education and into the<br />\nbroadcasting business. Surely<br />\nwe would all be impressed if<br />\nour station transmitted NPR<br />\nprogramming a la WBJC, but<br />\nwhy should the University<br />\nundertake the enormous cost of<br />\nreplicating a format already in<br />\nexistence on the airwaves? As a<br />\ncollege radio station, WJHU<br />\nhas no other purpose than to be<br />\nan outlet for student creativity.<br />\nIt should not be intended as a<br />\nmeans of entertaining the<br />\npublic from here to the<br />\nPotomac with a 25 kilowatt<br />\nsignal. Any wattage other than<br />\nthat which is needed to reach<br />\nthe University community and<br />\n<br />\nprotect its signal from intrusion<br />\nis wholly unnecessary. WJHU<br />\nmay go big-time, but the<br />\nstudents will lose out. The station will cease to be theirs.<br />\nFinally, I find it unconscionable that the University<br />\ncan justify paying someone to<br />\nprogram a station format that<br />\nPresident Muller describes as<br />\n\"some music and lacrosse<br />\ncoverage.\" Need I mention<br />\nmore pressing expenses such as<br />\nfaculty salaries? If WJHU served no other purpose than to<br />\nprovide a handful of students<br />\nthe opportunity to learn<br />\norganizational and managerial<br />\nskills, it should remain studentrun.<br />\nI urge the administration to<br />\nreconsider its position and<br />\nbegin a proper course of action,<br />\nfor I sense a double standard<br />\nwhen this school undergoes<br />\ngreat expense and effort to<br />\nmaintain its award-winning<br />\nlacrosse team, but neglects its<br />\naward-winning radig station.<br />\nJonathon Fishbein<br />\nSchool of Medicine<br />\nex-Program Director<br />\nand General Manager<br />\nWJRH-FM Lafayette College<br />\n<br />\nAre Students Friends?<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nBy now everyone has read,<br />\nor at least heard, about the \"Inaugural Dinner for the Campaign for Johns Hopkins\" to<br />\nbe held this Saturday night<br />\nfrom 6:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.<br />\nSurely you must also be aware<br />\nthat between 5:30 and 11:30<br />\nthat night there will be no access allowed to either the lower<br />\nor upper quads. In order to get<br />\nto student events that night, one<br />\nmust use the \"walkway by<br />\nMudd Hall\"(wherever that is),<br />\nor some other non-specified<br />\nroute to Levering Hall. This is<br />\nan infringemnt on our rights as<br />\nmatriculants of this University.<br />\nIn the letter of announcement from President Muller's<br />\noffice, it says that the event is<br />\nfor \"faculty, donors, and<br />\nfriends.\" Exactly what<br />\ncatagory do students come<br />\nunder? Surely we are donors(of<br />\n$8,600 a year)and friends(who<br />\nContinued on Page 8<br />\n<br />\n4-<br />\n<br />\nAlso, as a treshman I was offered a bit of wisdom by a<br />\ngraduating senior. He opined<br />\nthat the students were really<br />\nvery unimportant to the functioning of at least this University.

This is from the band,<br />\nafter all, that gave the world<br />\nsuch songs as \"HaHaHa\"(the<br />\nchorus of which is,\"Ha Ha Ha<br />\nHa Ha Ha Ha Ho Ho Ho Ho<br />\nHo Ho Ho Hee Hee Hee..<br />\nyou get the picture); \"Brainwash\", a song in which the<br />\nmusic is stopped 25 seconds<br />\nafter its beginning by the singer<br />\nwho says, \"Forget it. You<br />\nwouldn't understand anyway,\"<br />\nand then resumes and stops the<br />\nsong eleven more times; and<br />\n\"Sex Bomb\", the best party<br />\ntune of the 80's so far\u2014a<br />\nrollicking memorial to the<br />\nJayne<br />\ndecapitation<br />\nof<br />\nMansfield. And this is from the<br />\nband which released what may<br />\nbe the most intelligent punk<br />\nalbum ever\u2014Generic Flipper\u2014<br />\nin 1981. The problem,<br />\nhowever, is that Flipper hasn't<br />\nreleased another album since,<br />\nand only one single (the flipside of which was their version<br />\nof \"There was an Old<br />\nWoman.\")<br />\nThus, the release of Gone<br />\nFishin'is a much awaited event.<br />\nAnd the wait was justified.<br />\nGone Fishin' doesn't break<br />\n<br />\nmuch new ground as far as<br />\nFlipper is concerned, but it is a<br />\nsturdy elaboration on the Flipper concept. The songs are still<br />\nloud, chaotic, and slow, and<br />\nalthough the album is lacking<br />\nany truly original songs like<br />\n\"Sex Bomb\" or \"Ha Ha Ha\",<br />\ntheir intelligent and realistic<br />\nview of the world is still greatly in evidence.<br />\nMusically, Flipper is not<br />\nunlike some of the post-punk<br />\nEnglish dirge-bands, yet they<br />\ninject far more pure noise into<br />\ntheir efforts than the relatively<br />\nrestrained dirge-bands would<br />\never have dreamt of. Basically,<br />\nthe Flipper song consists of a<br />\nbass riff repeated in various<br />\nstages of distortion with a noisy<br />\nguitar wash in the background,<br />\nsometimes psychedelic in its effect. The two singers, goofyvoiced Will Shatter and the<br />\nmore conventional, threatening<br />\nBruce Lose, switch just about<br />\nevery other song. Gone Fishin'<br />\nimproves on this form\u2014adding<br />\na saxophone on \"First the<br />\nHeart\" and various electronic<br />\neffects on \"You Nought Me,\"<br />\nand utilizing two very strong<br />\nbass riffs on \"Survivors of the<br />\nPlague\" and \"Talk's Cheap.\"<br />\nBut ideas are Flipper's strong<br />\nsuit, and there are some pretty<br />\ninteresting ideas at work on this<br />\nalbum. \"Survivors of the<br />\nPlague,\" probably the album's<br />\nmost effective song, could have<br />\n<br />\nbeen off of a bad heavy metal<br />\nalbum, with its heavy bass riff<br />\nand science-fiction imagery, if<br />\nit weren't for Will Shatter's utterly un-macho singing and the<br />\nlyrics, which imply some sort of<br />\ncatastrophe such as a nuclear<br />\nwar or a \"Plague\" but<br />\nultimately invoke the somewhat<br />\nloftier view of the human condition as catastrophe: \"We<br />\nbuilt the palaces and the<br />\ngovernment houses/ We built<br />\nthese slums where we starve.\"<br />\nFlipper's existentialism is not<br />\nthe immature life-is-pointlessso-I'll-just-cry-about-it-to-you<br />\nattitude so prevalent in punk<br />\nand other 'hip' music circles.<br />\nBruce sings on \"You Nought<br />\nMe\":\"I'm happy with nothing<br />\nbecause nothing's what I<br />\nchoose\" but then admits \"But<br />\nnothing is only nothing/ and<br />\nthat's not so new.\" Nihilism,<br />\nyes. Uninformed nihilism, no.<br />\nAnd in the same song, the<br />\nchorus: \"You're only bored<br />\nwhen you're boring.\" Enough<br />\nsaid.<br />\nElsewhere things are interesting but more obscure.<br />\nFlipper has developed a more<br />\n'poetic' voice; in fact, one song,<br />\n\"In Life My Friends,\" is taken<br />\ndirectly from a poem by W. S.<br />\nHarris. Thus the album often<br />\nborders on artistic pretension,<br />\nthough the songs are always<br />\nredeemed by the extremely<br />\nchaotic and purposely inept<br />\n<br />\nmusic.<br />\nMy only real objections to<br />\nthis album lie in its brevity(only<br />\neight songs) and its 'newness'.<br />\nTwo of the songs (in fact two<br />\nof the album's weaker songs),<br />\n\"The Lights The Sound The<br />\nRhythm The Noise\" and<br />\n\"Sacrifice\", have been Flipper<br />\nstandards for years; thus there<br />\nare only six 'new' songs on this<br />\nalbum. In two years you would<br />\nthink they could come up with<br />\na few more.<br />\nNevertheless, it is very hard<br />\nto find fault with a band whose<br />\n<br />\nalbum cover can be cut-nfolded to make stand-ups of the<br />\ninfamous Flipper-truck, each<br />\nmember of the band, and<br />\nvarious miscellany including a<br />\nburning amp, making for a lovely coffee table display. Gone<br />\nFishin' is recommended to<br />\nanyone who likes his/her music<br />\nwith intelligence and a healthy<br />\ndose of noise.

This is the impression of Toby Ditz, professor of history at Hopkins, as<br />\nshe compares the student body<br />\nhere today to that of Northwestern University when she<br />\nwas an undergraduate.<br />\nDitz intends this statement to<br />\nbe a general one, not<br />\nnecessarily particular to<br />\nHopkins. She illustrates her<br />\npoint, however, using the<br />\nHopkins student body's lack of<br />\nconcern toward the almost<br />\nnonexistent, institutionalized<br />\nrecognition of women on campus. Apart from a small, yet<br />\nvery active women's center,<br />\nDitz believes there is \"in<br />\ngeneral, not much student activity towards women; there is<br />\na definite lack of focus on<br />\nwomen's issues.\" Ditz attributes this to the only recent<br />\nincorporation of women into<br />\nthe undergraduate student<br />\nbody. Nonetheless, the facts remain: at Hopkins no women's<br />\nstudy program exits, nor is<br />\nthere a formal institution for<br />\nsexual<br />\nharassment<br />\nor<br />\ndiscrimination, and there is an<br />\nabsurdly unbalanced ratio of<br />\nmale to female professors.<br />\n<br />\nWorst of all, no concerted effort has been made to change<br />\nthese conditions.<br />\nIt is possible that we have not<br />\nquestioned this void in the<br />\nsocial and academic resources<br />\navailable at many other<br />\nAmerican universities because<br />\nthe situation is not apparently<br />\nurgent. An average female student at Hopkins could, in most<br />\ninstances, successfully complete<br />\nher four years of study without<br />\never feeling she encountered a<br />\nsingle instance of prejudice or<br />\ndiscomfort due to the nature of<br />\nher sex. Therefore, she might<br />\nnever consider these issues<br />\nbecause they were never<br />\nbrought to her attention with<br />\nany immediacy. This was not<br />\n<br />\nand \"take myself seriously as everything (the women's movean intellectual and begin work ment), it's double duty and<br />\non my doctorate.\"<br />\nalways will be.\" She points out<br />\nRole models such as Ditz that it is very hard to get a PhD.<br />\nenable the women at Hopkins and have children. \"If you<br />\nto take for granted that their should be working seventy<br />\nstudies and careers are every bit hours a week, studying, but<br />\nas important as those of their also have a child who needs<br />\nmale counterparts.

You'll<br />\nseldom get 'Animal House,'<br />\nbut our boys can try awfully<br />\nhard if they want. And the nice<br />\nthing is, the whole campus is invited along for the ride.

They say they feel uncomfortable in a 400-person throng<br />\nand find the conversation<br />\nvague. In the face of such<br />\ndiscomfort, it's easy to waste<br />\nanother weekend at the Hut.<br />\nEducation is the key, as Mother<br />\nalways said; since she sent you<br />\nhere, mastering the elements of<br />\nfrat-party savoir-fair is your<br />\nduty. Party etiquette, if you<br />\nwill, thrives on a dark basement's conduciveness to meaningful eye contact, intimate<br />\nbrawls, and subliminal<br />\ndialogue.<br />\nLet me tell you about fraternity party etiquette. I've danced in TEP's beer-soaked basement and on the stage at Phi<br />\nPsi. I've climbed the stairs at<br />\n<br />\nSig Ep too many times. I've<br />\nbeen crushed in the notorious<br />\nWawa hallway and remember<br />\ntoo much about ATO and DU<br />\nto comment. Well, maybe I<br />\nhave yet to make it to AEP,but<br />\nyou get the point. You've been<br />\nnowhere and need to start the<br />\nglamourous social whirl, or<br />\nyou've been everywhere and are<br />\nbored.<br />\nThrough clever conversation,<br />\nlooking perfect, mastering<br />\nalcohol abuse and finding the<br />\nbathroom, you can turn a party into something to write letters about- not home, hopefully, but maybe to one of those<br />\nmagazines in Doc Johnson's<br />\nBook Nook.<br />\nThe key to making a suave<br />\nimpression as well as getting<br />\nacross your charming intentions<br />\nis the spoken word. English<br />\nhelps but Chinese is better if<br />\nyou're into engineers. Although<br />\nthe basic repertoire of party<br />\ncomments sounds simple, the<br />\ntruth lies far deeper than the<br />\nbeer-glazed surface of 'hi' and<br />\n'how are you.' Stop hydroplaning and learn how to translate<br />\nFratspeak into the subliminal<br />\ncommentary it really is. A few<br />\ncommon examples: You go<br />\nhere?(What were your SAT's)<br />\nSo, what do you think of the<br />\nfrat?(I was blackballed herefor<br />\nvomiting during last year's<br />\nrush.) What are you majoring<br />\nin? (Will you need to marry a<br />\nfuture doctor like me?) OR<br />\n(Will you be able to support a<br />\nlax-player like me?)I've got to<br />\nget another beer.(I've got to get<br />\n<br />\nthe hell awayfrom you.) I am<br />\nso trashed. (Don't hold me<br />\nresponsible if we wind up in<br />\nTowson tomorrow morning.)<br />\nI've got to go to the bathroom.<br />\n(For some reason, your personality makes me think of<br />\ngrotesque bodily functions.)<br />\nHow are you? (Horny?) What<br />\nyear are you? (Are you nubile<br />\nripe for consumption, or do<br />\nyou know the score?) This<br />\nschool has no social life.(I have<br />\nno sex life.) I'm from Jersey.<br />\n(Need I say more?)<br />\nIt's not just what you say, it's<br />\nalso how you look. Dress<br />\nreflects your attitude toward<br />\nlife, politics and champagne<br />\nbrunches. Proper etiquette dictates being very careful to look<br />\nlike you don't care at all.<br />\nIronic, huh? But if you're a<br />\nfreshman trying to develop an<br />\nM.M.R. (Meaningful Mature<br />\nRelationship) with some junior<br />\nwhile wearing pink shorts and<br />\npearls, he will know you are<br />\ngullible, innocent, and ripe for<br />\nabuse ranging from 'accidentally' upset beer on angora<br />\nsweaters to- well, it's illegal in<br />\nMaryland anyway. Try the subtle approach of wearing black<br />\nfrom head to toe. Beer will (invisibly) absorb, you'll stand out<br />\nin a pastel sea and they will all<br />\nwonder just how many whips<br />\nyou have at home.

Bregman<br />\nTomorrow marks the end of<br />\na great week for Amy Zimmerman. Granted, it has also been<br />\na great week for the varsity field<br />\nhockey team, which chalked up<br />\ntwo victories against Widener<br />\n(2-0) and Notre Dame (1-0).<br />\nBut the Blue Jays, last year's<br />\nrunners-up in the Maryland<br />\nState tournament, are used to<br />\nwinning. Before this week,<br />\nhowever, Zimmerman, the<br />\nJays' starting goalie, had never<br />\nrecorded a shutout.<br />\n\"I don't see myself as a<br />\ngoalie yet,\" said the junior,<br />\nwho took over the cage this<br />\nyear after playing all of her<br />\ncareer at field positions.<br />\nWhether she is aware of it or<br />\nnot, though, Zimmerman has<br />\nbeen anchoring a defense that<br />\nhas allowed three goals in four<br />\ngames.<br />\n\"I haven't really been<br />\nthreatened,\" she said. \"I've just<br />\nhad some plays that show that<br />\nI'm a patential goalie.\"<br />\nThe two victories lifted the<br />\nteam's record to 3-1, its only<br />\nloss coming in a 2-0 decision in<br />\nthe finals of the Drew Invitational Tournament.

Zimmerman<br />\ncredited Christensen with key<br />\nshot-stopping plays. \"She stops<br />\nthe ball more often than any<br />\nsweeper I've ever seen,\" said<br />\nthe goalkeeper. \"She plays her<br />\nentire game with a calm, patient<br />\nattitude.\" Staul was singled out<br />\nby Anderson for her skill as a<br />\ncovering back on fast breaks.<br />\nZimmerman, however, can<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\nLeft midfield Heather Klink battles for the ball against Notre Dame as goalie Amy Zimmerman and back<br />\nJennifer Staul look on.<br />\n<br />\nonly when a defender makes illegal contact with a player to<br />\nprevent a sure goal.

The conditions<br />\nfailed to dampen the offensive<br />\nplay of Jennifer Kenoian, the<br />\nBlue Jays scoring machine who<br />\nhas racked up five of the team's<br />\nseven goals thus far.

The other Hopkins<br />\nwomen in the top twenty were<br />\nDorothy Peterson (20:32),<br />\nKatia Smith (20:44), and Ngozi<br />\nOsuagwu (21:50).<br />\nCoach Gary Green was pleased with the team's perfor-<br />\n<br />\nmance, and attributed the fast<br />\ntimes to the course layout.<br />\n\"About the whole first mile<br />\nwas downhill, so the starting<br />\npace was fast,\" he said. \"The<br />\ngirls handled the course very<br />\nwell: a lot of times the tendency is to be shocked by a fast<br />\nsplit and slow down, but they<br />\nkept up the fast pace.\"<br />\nThe winner of the Invitational was UMBC, who will<br />\ntravel to Hopkins next Wednesday for what should be a very<br />\nclose dual meet.<br />\nCoach Green said, \"On<br />\npaper, it's a one-point race.<br />\nWe'll have Tatni Oki(the third<br />\ntri-captain), who didn't run in<br />\nthe Invitational and is one of<br />\nour top runners. That could be<br />\nthe difference we'll need.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins course, which<br />\nruns along University Parkway<br />\nand San Martin Drive, has<br />\nmore hills than the Invitational<br />\ncourse, so the times will be<br />\nslower.

Rarely do grades or class talk pop<br />\nup in conversation. Working<br />\nout builds up the body and<br />\nrelaxes the mind.<br />\nBy 5:00 p.m. on weekdays,<br />\n30 to 40 lifters and stretchers<br />\ndescend upon and fill the<br />\nweight room. A large number,<br />\nperhaps 85 percent, can handle<br />\nthe weights competently and<br />\nsafely, ten percent can do so expertly. The remaining five percent are the goof-offs striving<br />\nfor maximum lifts every bloody<br />\ntime they make their appearance, (usually once every<br />\ntwo weeks\u2014what dedication!)<br />\nThe majority of lifters makes<br />\nits home the Universal equipment, a smaller group attempts<br />\nan occaisional sortie to the free<br />\nweight bench press, and the<br />\nmost defiant (the chosen few),<br />\nchallenge the ominous squat<br />\nmuscular<br />\nTheir<br />\nrack.<br />\nachievements can be viewed<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nThe average lifter strives for<br />\nsome combination of muscle<br />\ntone, cardiovascular fitness,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCrowded conditions are the norm weekdays in the universal weight room.<br />\n<br />\npower, fat loss, and muscle<br />\ngain. Although a hard worker<br />\nmight achieve some muscle tone<br />\nand weight loss, the facility<br />\ndoes not provide for cardiovascular fitness. Circuit<br />\ntraining is very difficult in the<br />\ncrowded room, and a strenuous<br />\npower-lifting<br />\nworkout<br />\nmonopolizes all the free weight<br />\npieces, which makes it tough on<br />\nthe other ten people who want<br />\nto use the free weights<br />\nsimultaneously.<br />\nA carefully-selected array of<br />\nequipment, costing as little as<br />\n700 dollars, could vastly improve the gym's capabilities.<br />\nAn additional Olympic weight<br />\nset, an incline bench, and two<br />\nexercise mats would be a<br />\nrealistic start.<br />\nMeanwhile, in 1983-84, the<br />\nVarsity Weight Room received<br />\nthree spanking-new bench<br />\n<br />\nLifter pumping iron with the free weights.<br />\n<br />\npresses, two Olympic barbells,<br />\n300 to 400 pounds of free<br />\nweights, and wall-to-wall<br />\ncarpeting. The Universal weight<br />\nroom, in that same period, was<br />\ngiven an Olympic weight set, a<br />\nused bench press from the Varsity Weight Room, and a<br />\nmobile squat rack. The<br />\ncarpeting alone probably cost<br />\nmore than the total for the<br />\nUniversal weight room.<br />\nThe Varsity Room is used by<br />\na mere handful of dedicated<br />\nfootball players and wrestlers,<br />\nand a sprinkling of baseball,<br />\nlacrosse, and track and field<br />\nathletes.

The primary objective<br />\nof this campaign is to raise funds to improve<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nOne would expect students of the University to fully support such an endeavor, since<br />\nat the conclusion, students will be the<br />\nprimary beneficiaries. Student aid, research,<br />\ninstrumentation, and faculty and program<br />\nsupport are among the areas to which funds<br />\nshould be committed.<br />\nWhat is surprising is the feeling of alienation which many students feel regarding the<br />\nentire occasion. They feel they are being excluded; only a small percentage of the student population will be included in the<br />\nfestivities. They feel they are being kept off<br />\ntheir campus; the upper and lower quads are<br />\nbeing fenced off for the evening and locks<br />\non Homewood buildings are being changed<br />\nfor the weekend. In general, the students of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University feel they don't<br />\ncount, or that the University is ashamed of<br />\nthem.<br />\nThis perception is disturbing. Reasonably,<br />\nmost annoyances could be resolved in<br />\nstudents' minds. It would be extremely im-<br /><br />\npractical for the University to allow 3000 +<br />\nstudents to participate in the evening's activities, while at the same time entertaining<br />\napproximately 1000 potential donors. The<br />\nfencing and lock changes will enable a more<br />\neffective security system. Alternative events<br />\nare being planned under the auspices of the<br />\nstudent council, so that students will have<br />\nentertainment for the evening.<br />\nYet, the students should not have to decide<br />\nfor themselves that the agenda for Saturday<br />\nnight is the most practical. That point should<br />\nhave been made clear by the administration.<br />\nA general letter was issued by President<br />\nMuller to all students outlining the conditions involved in the Saturday extravaganza. This letter would have been the perfect<br />\nopportunity to explain to students exactly<br />\nwhy they were not invited and why certain<br />\nprecautions were being taken. Had the letter been composed with a more cordial tone,<br />\nand students been requested to cooperate instead of being told there would be\"no access,\" it would have had a more supportive<br />\nreception. Instead, the letter served to irritate<br />\nstudents, since it was written in a rather cold<br />\nand formal manner.<br />\nStudents; despite all rumors to the contrary, are people and deserve to be treated<br />\nas such. It seems the administration must be<br />\nreminded of this fact.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nStudent Frustration<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYou can't help but feel a lot<br />\nof frustration as you hear about<br />\nthe numerous examples of the<br />\nadministration excluding student participation in so many<br />\nareas of the workings of the<br />\nUniversity. In last week's NewsLetter, for example, we read<br />\nabout the Student Council's<br />\ndead-end attempt to express<br />\nstudent interest and initiative<br />\nfor the new Capitol Campaign.<br />\nThey heard answers like: the<br />\nadministration had decided<br />\nthere is no student interest, and<br />\nthe fact that students may feel<br />\nthat the MSE library is a prime<br />\ncandidate for increased funding<br />\nwas not, is not, and will not be<br />\nan important factor in the<br />\nallocations process. Of course<br />\nthere is also the obvious sham<br />\nbeing perpetrated on WJHU.<br />\nThe whole situation becomes<br />\nespecially insulting (yet almost<br />\namusing) when we hear administrators delivering their<br />\nspeeches on how students can<br />\nand should accept adult responsibilities, show initiative,<br />\nmanage themselves, work<br />\ntowards change, put in, put<br />\nout, grow up, etc.<br />\nAs a freshman, I had a show<br />\non WJHU, and was very involved with the station. I worked hard\u2014but not nearly as hard<br /><br />\nas so many other people who<br />\nmade the station happen\u2014from<br />\nkeeping the equipment in top<br />\nworking order and playing<br />\nmusic for every taste, to a<br />\nsignificant news operation and<br />\ncoverage of every home and<br />\naway lacrosse game. Professionalism is not too strong a<br />\nword for what the students and<br />\nmany community members\u2014<br />\nalmost all volunteers\u2014had<br />\nachieved. They built the<br />\nstudios, established contacts<br />\nwith record companies, provided community services and<br />\nbroadcast music that wasn't the<br />\ntight-rotation, top 14 commercial songs. For several years<br />\nnow, the station members have<br />\npursued the application for a<br />\npower increase (from 10 to<br />\n25,000 watts), working closely<br />\nwith the FCC and making<br />\ntechnical and programming<br />\npreparations. The administration received feedback and<br />\nissued instructions through the<br />\nmember-elected Managing<br />\nBoard<br />\nhired<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\nsecretary/office manager. The<br />\ncommunity was pleased and<br />\nsatisfied\u2014number one station<br />\nin Baltimore is no small<br />\nhonor\u2014and the station<br />\nmembers did a good job and<br />\nreceived valuable experience,<br />\nyet the administration didn't<br />\nsee fit to treat these people with<br />\ncommon dignity when they<br />\nsummarily shut down the sta-<br /><br />\ntion or mysteriously decided to<br />\nwait for 'green' students before<br />\nestablishing a new, top-down,<br />\nmanagerial hierarchy. I would<br />\nlike to pose an open question to<br />\nPresident Muller and the administration, the faculty, Student Council and student body:<br />\nIs there any reason why WJHU<br />\ncan't resume operation this<br />\nsemester, allowing the students<br />\nand community members to<br />\nreap the many benefits it has to<br />\noffer?<br /><br />\nIt came as a great disappointment to me to learn of the sad<br />\nfate of WJHU, the studentoperated radio station of the<br />\nUniversity. From the facts<br />\npresented in the News-Letter I<br />\ngather that the administration<br />\nneglected to give any thought to<br />\nthe future of WJHU when<br />\nplanning the renovation of<br />\nAMR II. Now that the station<br />\nhas been forced into a lengthy<br />\nperiod of inactivity, the school<br />\nis moving ever so slowly<br />\ntowards finding a new home for<br />\ncampus radio, and with a plan<br />\nthat can best be called illadvised. I challenge the administration to reevalute its objectives, and choose a course of<br />\naction that would allow WJHU<br />\nto remain a true college radio<br />\nstation.<br />\nWhat was most disheartening<br />\nto me is the administration's<br />\ndecision to appoint a professional manager for WJHU. I<br />\ncannot help but disagree with<br />\nB.J. Norris, Vice President of<br />\nCommunications and Publicity, when she insists that there<br />\nwill be plenty of room for student participation despite this<br />\nappointment. Professional station managers do not run college radio stations. Instead,<br />\nthey manage facilities whose<br />\npersonnel have primary responsibilities to the operation of the<br />\nstation. Our students have a<br />\nprimary responsibility to their<br />\nschoolwork. This leads me to<br />\nsuspect that the University is<br />\npreparing to move beyond the<br />\nrealm of education and into the<br />\nbroadcasting business. Surely<br />\nwe would all be impressed if<br />\nour station transmitted NPR<br />\nprogramming a la WBJC, but<br />\nwhy should the University<br />\nundertake the enormous cost of<br />\nreplicating a format already in<br />\nexistence on the airwaves? As a<br />\ncollege radio station, WJHU<br />\nhas no other purpose than to be<br />\nan outlet for student creativity.<br />\nIt should not be intended as a<br />\nmeans of entertaining the<br />\npublic from here to the<br />\nPotomac with a 25 kilowatt<br />\nsignal. Any wattage other than<br />\nthat which is needed to reach<br />\nthe University community and<br /><br />\nprotect its signal from intrusion<br />\nis wholly unnecessary. WJHU<br />\nmay go big-time, but the<br />\nstudents will lose out. The station will cease to be theirs.<br />\nFinally, I find it unconscionable that the University<br />\ncan justify paying someone to<br />\nprogram a station format that<br />\nPresident Muller describes as<br />\n\"some music and lacrosse<br />\ncoverage.\" Need I mention<br />\nmore pressing expenses such as<br />\nfaculty salaries? If WJHU served no other purpose than to<br />\nprovide a handful of students<br />\nthe opportunity to learn<br />\norganizational and managerial<br />\nskills, it should remain studentrun.<br />\nI urge the administration to<br />\nreconsider its position and<br />\nbegin a proper course of action,<br />\nfor I sense a double standard<br />\nwhen this school undergoes<br />\ngreat expense and effort to<br />\nmaintain its award-winning<br />\nlacrosse team, but neglects its<br />\naward-winning radig station.<br />\nJonathon Fishbein<br />\nSchool of Medicine<br />\nex-Program Director<br />\nand General Manager<br />\nWJRH-FM Lafayette College<br /><br />\nAre Students Friends?<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nBy now everyone has read,<br />\nor at least heard, about the \"Inaugural Dinner for the Campaign for Johns Hopkins\" to<br />\nbe held this Saturday night<br />\nfrom 6:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.<br />\nSurely you must also be aware<br />\nthat between 5:30 and 11:30<br />\nthat night there will be no access allowed to either the lower<br />\nor upper quads. In order to get<br />\nto student events that night, one<br />\nmust use the \"walkway by<br />\nMudd Hall\"(wherever that is),<br />\nor some other non-specified<br />\nroute to Levering Hall. This is<br />\nan infringemnt on our rights as<br />\nmatriculants of this University.<br />\nIn the letter of announcement from President Muller's<br />\noffice, it says that the event is<br />\nfor \"faculty, donors, and<br />\nfriends.\" Exactly what<br />\ncatagory do students come<br />\nunder? Surely we are donors(of<br />\n$8,600 a year)and friends(who<br />\nContinued on Page 8<br /><br />\n4-<br /><br />\nAlso, as a treshman I was offered a bit of wisdom by a<br />\ngraduating senior. He opined<br />\nthat the students were really<br />\nvery unimportant to the functioning of at least this University. The administration and<br />\nmuch of the faculty feel that<br />\nsince undergrads are only here<br />\nfour years, and they're here<br />\nlonger, they've got to be able to<br />\nlive with\u2014indeed make\u2014the<br />\ndecisions.

This is from the band,<br />\nafter all, that gave the world<br />\nsuch songs as \"HaHaHa\"(the<br />\nchorus of which is,\"Ha Ha Ha<br />\nHa Ha Ha Ha Ho Ho Ho Ho<br />\nHo Ho Ho Hee Hee Hee..<br />\nyou get the picture); \"Brainwash\", a song in which the<br />\nmusic is stopped 25 seconds<br />\nafter its beginning by the singer<br />\nwho says, \"Forget it. You<br />\nwouldn't understand anyway,\"<br />\nand then resumes and stops the<br />\nsong eleven more times; and<br />\n\"Sex Bomb\", the best party<br />\ntune of the 80's so far\u2014a<br />\nrollicking memorial to the<br />\nJayne<br />\ndecapitation<br />\nof<br />\nMansfield. And this is from the<br />\nband which released what may<br />\nbe the most intelligent punk<br />\nalbum ever\u2014Generic Flipper\u2014<br />\nin 1981. The problem,<br />\nhowever, is that Flipper hasn't<br />\nreleased another album since,<br />\nand only one single (the flipside of which was their version<br />\nof \"There was an Old<br />\nWoman.\")<br />\nThus, the release of Gone<br />\nFishin'is a much awaited event.<br />\nAnd the wait was justified.<br />\nGone Fishin' doesn't break<br /><br />\nmuch new ground as far as<br />\nFlipper is concerned, but it is a<br />\nsturdy elaboration on the Flipper concept. The songs are still<br />\nloud, chaotic, and slow, and<br />\nalthough the album is lacking<br />\nany truly original songs like<br />\n\"Sex Bomb\" or \"Ha Ha Ha\",<br />\ntheir intelligent and realistic<br />\nview of the world is still greatly in evidence.<br />\nMusically, Flipper is not<br />\nunlike some of the post-punk<br />\nEnglish dirge-bands, yet they<br />\ninject far more pure noise into<br />\ntheir efforts than the relatively<br />\nrestrained dirge-bands would<br />\never have dreamt of. Basically,<br />\nthe Flipper song consists of a<br />\nbass riff repeated in various<br />\nstages of distortion with a noisy<br />\nguitar wash in the background,<br />\nsometimes psychedelic in its effect. The two singers, goofyvoiced Will Shatter and the<br />\nmore conventional, threatening<br />\nBruce Lose, switch just about<br />\nevery other song. Gone Fishin'<br />\nimproves on this form\u2014adding<br />\na saxophone on \"First the<br />\nHeart\" and various electronic<br />\neffects on \"You Nought Me,\"<br />\nand utilizing two very strong<br />\nbass riffs on \"Survivors of the<br />\nPlague\" and \"Talk's Cheap.\"<br />\nBut ideas are Flipper's strong<br />\nsuit, and there are some pretty<br />\ninteresting ideas at work on this<br />\nalbum. \"Survivors of the<br />\nPlague,\" probably the album's<br />\nmost effective song, could have<br /><br />\nbeen off of a bad heavy metal<br />\nalbum, with its heavy bass riff<br />\nand science-fiction imagery, if<br />\nit weren't for Will Shatter's utterly un-macho singing and the<br />\nlyrics, which imply some sort of<br />\ncatastrophe such as a nuclear<br />\nwar or a \"Plague\" but<br />\nultimately invoke the somewhat<br />\nloftier view of the human condition as catastrophe: \"We<br />\nbuilt the palaces and the<br />\ngovernment houses/ We built<br />\nthese slums where we starve.\"<br />\nFlipper's existentialism is not<br />\nthe immature life-is-pointlessso-I'll-just-cry-about-it-to-you<br />\nattitude so prevalent in punk<br />\nand other 'hip' music circles.<br />\nBruce sings on \"You Nought<br />\nMe\":\"I'm happy with nothing<br />\nbecause nothing's what I<br />\nchoose\" but then admits \"But<br />\nnothing is only nothing/ and<br />\nthat's not so new.\" Nihilism,<br />\nyes. Uninformed nihilism, no.<br />\nAnd in the same song, the<br />\nchorus: \"You're only bored<br />\nwhen you're boring.\" Enough<br />\nsaid.<br />\nElsewhere things are interesting but more obscure.<br />\nFlipper has developed a more<br />\n'poetic' voice; in fact, one song,<br />\n\"In Life My Friends,\" is taken<br />\ndirectly from a poem by W. S.<br />\nHarris. Thus the album often<br />\nborders on artistic pretension,<br />\nthough the songs are always<br />\nredeemed by the extremely<br />\nchaotic and purposely inept<br /><br />\nmusic.<br />\nMy only real objections to<br />\nthis album lie in its brevity(only<br />\neight songs) and its 'newness'.<br />\nTwo of the songs (in fact two<br />\nof the album's weaker songs),<br />\n\"The Lights The Sound The<br />\nRhythm The Noise\" and<br />\n\"Sacrifice\", have been Flipper<br />\nstandards for years; thus there<br />\nare only six 'new' songs on this<br />\nalbum. In two years you would<br />\nthink they could come up with<br />\na few more.<br />\nNevertheless, it is very hard<br />\nto find fault with a band whose<br /><br />\nalbum cover can be cut-nfolded to make stand-ups of the<br />\ninfamous Flipper-truck, each<br />\nmember of the band, and<br />\nvarious miscellany including a<br />\nburning amp, making for a lovely coffee table display. Gone<br />\nFishin' is recommended to<br />\nanyone who likes his/her music<br />\nwith intelligence and a healthy<br />\ndose of noise.

This is the impression of Toby Ditz, professor of history at Hopkins, as<br />\nshe compares the student body<br />\nhere today to that of Northwestern University when she<br />\nwas an undergraduate.<br />\nDitz intends this statement to<br />\nbe a general one, not<br />\nnecessarily particular to<br />\nHopkins. She illustrates her<br />\npoint, however, using the<br />\nHopkins student body's lack of<br />\nconcern toward the almost<br />\nnonexistent, institutionalized<br />\nrecognition of women on campus. Apart from a small, yet<br />\nvery active women's center,<br />\nDitz believes there is \"in<br />\ngeneral, not much student activity towards women; there is<br />\na definite lack of focus on<br />\nwomen's issues.\" Ditz attributes this to the only recent<br />\nincorporation of women into<br />\nthe undergraduate student<br />\nbody. Nonetheless, the facts remain: at Hopkins no women's<br />\nstudy program exits, nor is<br />\nthere a formal institution for<br />\nsexual<br />\nharassment<br />\nor<br />\ndiscrimination, and there is an<br />\nabsurdly unbalanced ratio of<br />\nmale to female professors.<br /><br />\nWorst of all, no concerted effort has been made to change<br />\nthese conditions.<br />\nIt is possible that we have not<br />\nquestioned this void in the<br />\nsocial and academic resources<br />\navailable at many other<br />\nAmerican universities because<br />\nthe situation is not apparently<br />\nurgent. An average female student at Hopkins could, in most<br />\ninstances, successfully complete<br />\nher four years of study without<br />\never feeling she encountered a<br />\nsingle instance of prejudice or<br />\ndiscomfort due to the nature of<br />\nher sex.

Granted, it has also been<br />\na great week for the varsity field<br />\nhockey team, which chalked up<br />\ntwo victories against Widener<br />\n(2-0) and Notre Dame (1-0).<br />\nBut the Blue Jays, last year's<br />\nrunners-up in the Maryland<br />\nState tournament, are used to<br />\nwinning. Before this week,<br />\nhowever, Zimmerman, the<br />\nJays' starting goalie, had never<br />\nrecorded a shutout.<br />\n\"I don't see myself as a<br />\ngoalie yet,\" said the junior,<br />\nwho took over the cage this<br />\nyear after playing all of her<br />\ncareer at field positions.<br />\nWhether she is aware of it or<br />\nnot, though, Zimmerman has<br />\nbeen anchoring a defense that<br />\nhas allowed three goals in four<br />\ngames.<br />\n\"I haven't really been<br />\nthreatened,\" she said. \"I've just<br />\nhad some plays that show that<br />\nI'm a patential goalie.\"<br />\nThe two victories lifted the<br />\nteam's record to 3-1, its only<br />\nloss coming in a 2-0 decision in<br />\nthe finals of the Drew Invitational Tournament.
