Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium. Drawing mainly<br />\nfrom his column, Anderson<br />\nentertained and informed the<br />\naudience of 700 for two hours.<br />\nHe began by justifying his<br />\nuse of unauthorized sources for<br />\ninformation.<br />\n\"Anywhere else in the nation,\" he said, \"reporters go to<br />\nthe newsmakers for news.<br />\nThat's not the case in<br />\nWashington. The newsmakers<br />\nthere are politicians. Politicians<br />\nonly give you authorized<br />\nnews\u2014what they want you to<br />\n<br />\nJack Anderson<br />\n<br />\nknow. The role of the newsman<br />\nis to dig up what government is<br />\ntrying to cover up.\"<br />\nAnderson uses the same<br />\nsources of information that the<br />\npresident receives: intelligence<br />\nreports from office aides,<br />\ncabinet members and the various committees and agencies in<br />\nWashington. He expressed surprise at the number of crises<br />\nwhich he had known of in advance, but of which the presi-<br />\n<br />\ndent didn't seem to know.<br />\nOne example which he cited<br />\nwas that former President Nixon was warned of an oil shortage and given a dozen choices,<br />\nany one of which would have<br />\nprevented the shortage. All<br />\nwere possibly harmful to him<br />\npolitically, so Nixon decided to<br />\nleave the matter alone until<br />\nafter the next election. The<br />\nresult was the 40-fold jump in<br />\noil prices, Andersbn stated.<br />\nHe then read on stage the<br />\nMarch 6, 1981 column that he<br />\nhad written warning the public<br />\nof an Israeli incursion into<br />\nLebanon, 15 months before the<br />\nactual invasion.<br />\nThis brought up the subject<br />\nof the Soviet invasion of<br />\nAfghanistan. Angered by<br />\nformer President Carter's<br />\nastonishment at the invasion,<br />\n<br />\nSunpaper Publisher Reg Murphy<br />\nConcludes '82 MSE Symposium<br />\nBY CATHERINE RAEFF<br />\nPresident of the A.S. Abell<br />\nPublishing Co. and publisher<br />\nof the Sunpapers for the last<br />\nsixteen months, Reg Murphy,<br />\nspoke to an audience of about<br />\n200 at Monday evening's MSE<br />\nSymposium on the future of<br />\nprint and electronic media.<br />\nMurphy's speech on the \"Marriage of Print and Electronic<br />\nMedia\" was the last of the<br />\nseries.<br />\nWith the rise of the computer<br />\nage, there has been misleading<br />\nevidence that the newspaper is<br />\ndying. However, with each<br />\nshutdown, 20 new papers are<br />\nestablished, and Murphy added, \"circulation is as high as it<br />\nhas ever been\" and \"things<br />\nhave begun to happen in print<br />\nthat are encouraging.\" Nevertheless, Murphy said \"I began<br />\nto worry how I [could] put<br />\ntogether a diversified package<br />\nfor people to find the. most important and interesting information...on a constant basis.\"<br />\nMurphy's first step in the<br />\nstrategic plan to give different<br />\npeople the information they<br />\nfind individually most interesting was to add to the<br />\nEvening and Morning Sun to<br />\n\"give people a reason to read<br />\nboth papers and to make both<br />\ninteresting to people who have<br />\ndifferent interests in the community.\" In order to give people information they want when<br />\nthey want it, it is necessary to<br />\nintroduce electronic information which Murphy said \"is<br />\ntart of the information system<br />\n<br />\nof the future.\"<br />\nTo participate in the new<br />\nsystem, the Sunpapers are<br />\nbecoming part of the Viewtron<br />\ncomputer system which will<br />\nenable the reader to obtain the<br />\ninformation he needs at any<br />\ngiven moment. In simple terms,<br />\na reader will have. a modicum<br />\nconnected to his television and<br />\na key pad with the numbers one<br />\nto ten and zero on it. One punches the pad to dial one's phone<br />\ninto the Viewtron computer,<br />\nwhich is in turn hooked up to<br />\nthe modicum through the<br />\nphone. The program is then<br />\ntransmitted to the television<br />\nscreen. A choice of subjects and<br />\ntheir respective code numbers<br />\nwill appear on the screen, and<br />\nthen the reader can punch the<br />\nappropriate numbers into his<br />\npad to receive the information<br />\nhe wants. Information from<br />\nany Sunpaper can be obtained,<br />\nand it will be continually<br />\nupdated.<br />\nAlthough it is still in its experimental stages, Murphy believes that the Viewtron system<br />\nwill become more and more<br />\npopular in the BaltimoreWashington metropolitan area,<br />\nand by 1985 will be put into<br />\npractical use for all. He said<br />\nthat the entire American communications system is experiencing a revolution resulting t'rom<br />\nthe recent loosening of federal<br />\nregulations in that area. The<br />\nmanner in which people spend<br />\ntime and money to obtain information has also gone<br />\nthrough radical changes.

In order to utilize<br />\nViewtron, one must learn to<br />\nutilize print. He said, \"Knowledge is power and you don't get<br />\nknowledge by hearing something on a fleeting basis and not<br />\nseeing it written down.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnderson exclaimed,\"We have<br />\nsatellites that can read your<br />\nlicense plates. It's not that difficult to sight a whole invasion<br />\nforce. We knew where they<br />\nwere and how many, yet Carter<br />\ncouldn't understand!\"<br />\nAnderson claimed that conversations inside the Kremlin<br />\nare not protected from<br />\nAmerican listening devices. He<br />\nwent on to say that \"the Soviet<br />\ngovernment isn't trying to keep<br />\ninformation from the United<br />\nStates, but from its own people.<br />\nIt's the same thing our government is doing.\"<br />\nBacking up his statement that<br />\nthe Reagan administration is interested not in security but in<br />\ncensorship, he revealed how a<br />\nreporter on his staff obtained<br />\nblueprints, security plans and<br />\nelectronic data from the White<br />\n<br />\nHouse, the crisis center at the<br />\nPentagon, and the Central Intelligence Agency Headquarters. The reporter, wearing<br />\na loud red jacket, gathered the<br />\ndata together to be photocopied. When told the copy<br />\nmachine operated only by code,<br />\nhe simply stopped a man in the<br />\nhall, and explained to him that<br />\nhe had \"forgotten\" the code.<br />\nThe man, without asking for<br />\nany credentials, helped Anderson's reporter copy the plans.<br />\nAnderson reiterated that the<br />\nduty of the press is to keep a<br />\n,\"spotlight\" on the government's activities, and that his<br />\n:confidential sources enabled<br />\nhim to do this.

Yet the preliminary draft has<br />\nelicted some faculty complaints. Some have<br />\nargued that it does not establish clear<br />\npriorities.

Due to this prospect<br />\nand because the advantages for industry investment are not obvious, the need for a<br />\ncoherent, comprehensive plan is paramount.<br />\nIn this respect, the Christ Committee report<br />\nfor the Arts and Sciences division leaves<br />\nmuch to be desired. This is reflected by the<br />\nextent of faculty criticism. The report fails<br />\nto convey any sense of where the school<br />\nwants to go during the next decade. In<br />\noutlining priorities, it eschews politically sensitive issues. Certainly everybody favors<br />\nlibrary improvements, visiting professorships<br />\nand post-doctoral fellowships. But as<br />\nPolitical Economy Professor Bela Balassa<br />\nstressed at last week's General Assembly<br />\nmeeting, a much more serious problem lies<br />\nin the declining quality of many Arts and<br />\nSciences departments. However, once one<br />\nbegins to target certain areas of need,<br />\npolitical tensions invariably mount.<br />\nAlthough the Christ report does emphasize<br />\nimportant issues such as financial aid and<br />\nan effort to concentrate on astrophysics (an<br />\nobvious choice for growth because of the<br />\npresence of the Space Telescope Institute),<br />\nit must go much further in establishing<br />\npriorities and general goals for the division.<br />\nOtherwise the division may face ten more<br />\nyears of what Physics Professor J.C. Walker<br />\ntermed, \"flubbing around as usual.\" For<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences division, the task of effective planning in a no-growth environment<br />\nis difficult yet essential in terms of efficiency and selling the division. For the sake of<br />\nthe University's future, it is hoped that the<br />\nChrist Committee will not end up as another<br />\nopportunity lost.<br />\n<br />\nCongress And Student Aid<br />\nAs far as students are concerned, probably<br />\nthe most important issue on the national<br />\npolitical scene is financial aid. The effect of'<br />\nthis week's elections on student aid prospects<br />\nare likely to be positive. Although it is<br />\nunlikely that the new Congress will be able<br />\nto reverse the trends of the past two years,<br />\nfurther efforts to reduce federal assistance<br />\nwill likely be stymied.<br />\nIn preparation for the 1983 budget, the<br />\nReagan administration had proposed severe<br />\ncutbacks in funds for National Direct Student Loans, Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grants and funds for Work Study.<br />\n<br />\nThere was even talk of eliminating<br />\nGuaranteed Student Loans. These programs<br />\nnow appear to be safe.<br />\nThe likelihood for any increase in federal<br />\naid for students is minimal and would probably occur only if a decrease in military expenditures allowed additional funds to be<br />\ndiverted to social programs. The chances of<br />\nthis occurring remain small. Nevertheless, the<br />\ngood news is that it seems as though for at<br />\nleast two years, the conservative trends that<br />\nhave wiped away student aid benefits have<br />\nbeen ground to a halt.<br />\n<br />\nExpensive Incompetence<br />\nEight thousand dollars is a lot of money.<br />\nStudents at one point risked this loss.<br />\nat the Clarence Clemons concert due to poor<br />\nplanning by the chairpersons of the Speaker<br />\nand Concert Committee. Their incompetence<br />\nhas threatened all student social activities for<br />\nthe rest of this year.<br />\nChairpersons Tina Bovis and Jell Aronoff<br />\napparently made the decision to get Clemons<br />\nagainst the wishes of their committee. Their<br />\nchoice necessitated high ticket prices that<br />\nhave turned away many students. Even so,<br />\nwith a good publicity campaign they should<br />\nhave had no problem selling out the show.<br />\nPeople who have seen Clemons in concert<br />\n<br />\nin the past can attest that he is a good performer. There are certainly enough students<br />\naround who would be willing to pay seven<br />\ndollars to see a good show. Yet again Bovis<br />\nand Aronoll failed. They pursued their<br />\nduties in a nonaggressive manner that<br />\nresulted in few ticket sales on and off campus. As a result the Student Council has been<br />\nforced to take up much of the work. Ticket<br />\nsales are now picking up, as should be expected. Yet the irresponsibility of the<br />\nSpeaker and Concert Committee chairpersons must not be overlooked.

Mitchell, was in<br />\nBaltimore's Inner Harbor.<br />\nThrough the efforts of<br />\nBaltimore's mayor, William<br />\nSchaefer, the National Oceanic<br />\nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) presented a<br />\nspecial exhibition of the activities of NOAA. Along with<br />\nthe exhibition were tours of the<br />\nMt. Mitchell. This special<br />\nvisitation of Baltimore by the<br />\nship was part of a program to<br />\npromote the various programs<br />\nof NOAA.<br />\n<br />\ngovernment into one entity.<br />\nOne of the many programs<br />\nwithin NOAA is the National<br />\nOcean Survey. Its purpose is to<br />\nstudy and chart the ocean bottom. It allows the safe navigation of the sea by merchants,<br />\nwith vessels ranging in size from<br />\nfishing boats to oil tankers, by<br />\nyachtsmen and by the Navy.<br />\nThe hydrographic surveys are,<br />\nhowever, \u2022 limited to the territorial waters of the U.S. One<br />\nof the critical components of<br />\nthis surveying is the Mt.<br />\nMitchell.<br />\nThe Mt. Mitchell is a part of<br />\nthe NOAA fleet of about 22<br />\nvessels. Some of these ships are<br />\nas long as 300 feet, while others<br />\n<br />\nallows for the efficient processing of hydrographic data. Each<br />\nof the four launches carries<br />\n'three to four people and the<br />\ncorresponding research equipment. Since the ship also<br />\noperates over extended periods<br />\nof time, it contains equipment<br />\nthat can produce up to 3,000<br />\ngallons of fresh water a day.<br />\nThe staff of the Mt. Mitchell<br />\nincludes a crew of 70 and 13<br />\ncommissioned officers. The<br />\nessential nature of having a<br />\ncompetent ,:rew working alongside the officers is emphasized<br />\nby the envirorment that all<br />\nwork in. During bad weather,<br />\nthere is a great reliance on skilled sailors in both the launches<br />\n<br />\nNew<br />\nnglarPizz<br />\na<br />\nvi<br />\n<br />\nHot and Cold Subs<br />\n<br />\nSouvlaki<br />\nGyros<br />\nUniversity and 33rd St.<br />\nDaily: 10 AM -2 AM<br />\nPhone ahead : 467 - 1022<br />\n<br />\nto\"<br />\n<br />\n, ,.\u2022<br />\n<br />\nhi<br />\n<br />\nTHE END<br />\nTO<br />\nSTUDENT UNREST<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n00100111....<br />\nEl:.<br />\n<br />\n11/111111rt<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nlb?<br />\n<br />\n111111111111111P\"..<br />\n<br />\nipoxis<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\na94.111!\".\"\"---711<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\noF<br />\n<br />\n\u2022'<br />\n1.\u2022<br />\n<br />\n..7\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nAmong the activities that the<br />\nexhibition displayed were the<br />\nNational Weather Service, the<br />\nemergency broadcast system,<br />\n.and hydrographic surveying.<br />\nThe last, hydrographic surveying, which involves the mapping of the ocean bottom, is the<br />\nprimary activity of the Mt.<br />\nMitchell.<br />\nThe arrival of the Mt. Mitchell in Baltimore's harbor<br />\ncoincided almost exactly, with<br />\nthe twelfth anniversary of the<br />\nformation of NOAA as a part<br />\nof the U.S. Department of<br />\nCommerce. This date marked<br />\nthe consolidation of many of<br />\nthe marine and weather research activities of the federal<br />\n<br />\nommissioned officer<br />\n<br />\nare no longer than fishing<br />\nboats. The Mt. Mitchell is a<br />\nclass II vessel, is 231 feet long,<br />\nand has a maximum width of<br />\n42 feet. The longest vessels(the<br />\nclass I ships) are almost floating<br />\nhotels for scientists.<br />\nFor its hydrographic surveying, the Mt. Mitchell is outfitted with modern electronic<br />\npositioning systems, precision<br />\ndepth recorders and a cornputerized data acquisition<br />\nsystem. The Mt. Mitchell carries four survey launches, each<br />\nof which can operate in as little as 30 feet of water, and two<br />\nof which are equipped with<br />\ndata acquisition systems identical to those on the ship.

I his dependence on, and cooperation<br />\nwith, one anotrer is fostered by<br />\na family-type atmosphere<br />\naboard the ship. This certain atmosphere has been said to be<br />\ngreater on the Mt. Mitchell<br />\nthan on other research vessels,<br />\nlargely because of the efforts of<br />\nall those aboard the ship to<br />\nmake it that way.<br />\n-One of the ship's officers,<br />\nFred Rossman, provided many<br />\ninteresting insights into thL<br />\noperation of the ship. Among<br />\nthe items he mentioned was Eh(<br />\nfact that commissioned officer,<br />\naboard the vessel control thc<br />\nnavigation and propulsion of<br />\nthe ship, and are also engaged<br />\nin the survey work. These officers, divided into senior and<br />\njunior officers, must have a<br />\nbachelor degree in science or<br />\nengineering.<br />\nFred Rossman, an officer for<br />\ntwo years, pointed out that<br />\ncommissioned officers aboard<br />\nthe Mt. Mitchell and all other<br />\nNOAA vessels are members of<br />\nthe NOAA Corps of Officers,<br />\none of the seven uniformed services in the U.S. today.-While<br />\nnot extremely large (the entire<br />\ncorps has less than 400<br />\nmembers), the corps provides a<br />\nvery adequate source of trained individuals to run the<br />\nNOAA's research vessels.<br />\nAmong the officers, the<br />\nsenior officers are permanent<br />\nofficers. This contrasts to the<br />\njunior officers, who elect to<br />\nserve for a fixed period of time,<br />\nafter which they have completed their tour of duty.<br />\nWhile some people may<br />\nthink they have a long work<br />\ncon/. o,iji. /0<br />\n<br />\nALL<br />\n<br />\nFUTON<br />\n<br />\ncorroN MATTRESS\u2022 FIRM<br />\n<br />\nINEXPENSIVE\u2022 PORTABLE<br />\n<br />\nDELIVERY CAN BE ARRANGED<br />\nFUTONS from SHONIN<br />\n1804 McGucklan Street Annapolis, Maryland 21401<br />\n<br />\n3501 St Paul Street (The Marylander Apts.)<br />\nOpen 7 Days.a Week 7AM -7PM<br />\n235-0444<br />\nEntrance on University Pkwy.<br />\n<br />\n\fHouse<br />\nBY BECKY BJORNSON<br />\nBaltimore was an important city in<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe's life; it was here<br />\nthat he first gained public recognition. He lived in various houses<br />\nthroughout the city, and one, at 203<br />\nN. Amity Street, has been restored<br />\nand is now open to the public. In<br />\n1849, while passing through Baltimore, Poe died and was buried in<br />\nthe western burial grounds at<br />\nWestminster Church. There is an<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore, founded over 60 years ago to<br />\nhonor Poe, which now has members<br />\nfrom all over the world.<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe, known today as<br />\na master of the short story and the<br />\ninventor of the detective story, was<br />\nborn in 1809. Orphaned at an early<br />\nage, he grew up in Richmond, Virginia, under the care of Mr. and Mrs.<br />\nJohn Allan. Edgar's relations with<br />\nthe Allans were never good, and as<br />\nhe grew older, the tension between<br />\nthem grew. After many unfortunate<br />\nincidents, Poe left Richmond and<br />\nenlisted in the Army. He received his<br />\n<br />\nRestaurant Review<br />\n<br />\nPoe<br />\ning these years, including \"Berenice\"<br />\nand \"A Descent into the Maelstrom.\" Poe married his cousin<br />\nVirginia in 1836, and then moved to<br />\nRichmond, where he took the first of<br />\nhis many short-lived editorial positions. They later lived in Philadelphia<br />\nand New York, where Virginia died<br />\nin 1847. During this time Poe became<br />\nfamous for his poem \"The Raven,\"<br />\nhis short stories, and his reviews.<br />\nHowever, he remained poor. Poe<br />\njourneyed to Richmond in 1849, and<br />\nfrom there he headed back north. On<br />\nOctober 3, he was found unconscious<br />\non Lombard Street in Baltimore. He<br />\nwas taken to a hospital, and died four<br />\ndays later.<br />\nPoe lived on Amity Street in a tiny<br />\nrowhouse built some time between<br />\n1825 and 1830. Poe and his relatives<br />\nwere probably the first occupants of<br />\nthe house. Eight other families lived<br />\nin the house at various times until<br />\n1922, when the last family moved<br />\nout. The Poe Society of Baltimore acquired the lease of the house some<br />\ntime after that, opened it to the<br />\n<br />\nP.J.'s: A Bar With Tables<br />\nBY CHARLIE KRUZANSKY<br />\nWalking in off the street it is easy<br />\nto see why P..1.'5 is called a Pub\u2014it<br />\nis very dark. Using the only light<br />\nsource, the Coke machine, we read<br />\nthe menu for fifteen minutes. There<br />\nare fifteen items on the menu.<br />\nNobody was in a hurry. Prices range<br />\nFrom $2.75 for a chef's salad to $5.50<br />\nfor a shrimp basket. \"N.J.'s<br />\nBurgers's\" are $2.95 and pizza is<br />\n$6.00. I hear it is good. After ordering we waited fifteen more minutes,<br />\nduring which time the waitress<br />\nbrought us our plastic forks, knives<br />\nand spoons.<br />\nCoffee, when it arrived, was served with powdered creamer, sort of<br />\nlike at Memorial Stadium. My turkey<br />\nsandwich was a round of thickly sliced turkey piled onto a white roll. It<br />\nwasn't good. The \"chips,\" served<br />\nwith the sandwich, were chunks of<br />\npotato that seemed to have bypassed<br />\none stage of their preparation\u2014I<br />\nthink it was the cooking stage. A<br />\ncomrade's opinion of the roast beef<br />\nwas \"this isn't good.\"<br />\nThe lukewarm crab soup tasted<br />\n<br />\nlike Campbell's vegetable with some<br />\ncrab seasoning sprinkled on top.<br />\nEating with a plastic spoon didn't<br />\nhelp.<br />\nWe thought that maybe P.J.'s<br />\nwould be better suited for drinking<br />\nthan eating. Beer is heavily advertised, as is their \"happy hour.\" What<br />\nisn't mentioned is that happy hour<br />\nonly applies to the bar, so a Bud<br />\nsavored sitting at a table will cost<br />\n$1.15. Pitchers are $7.00, and mixed<br />\ndrinks are $1.50 and up.<br />\nBy all indication, it seems that<br />\n13..1.'s Pub is not much more than a<br />\nbar with tables. The food we tried<br />\nwas bad, and the prices are high. But<br />\nI hear the pizza is, good. It is very<br />\ndark, and the tables are so close to<br />\neach other that everyone shares conversation and cigarette smoke. You<br />\nprobably won't feel compelled to<br />\nleave a tip. Names of restaurants<br />\nusually intrigue me, but P.J.'s<br />\ndoesn't: it stands for \"pretty junky.\"<br />\nP.J.'s Pub is located at 3333 North<br />\nCharles St. in the basement QI the<br />\nCharles apartment building.

Here<br />\nhe took to writing. He published a<br />\nfew poems, but most of his work<br />\nwent unpaid.<br />\nFrom 1832 to 1835, Poe lived with<br />\nhis aunt, grandmother and cousin on<br />\nAmity Street. These years of his life<br />\nwere filled with poverty and ill health,<br />\nbut he continued to write. In 1833<br />\nPoe had his first major success: he<br />\nwon the $50 first prize for \"MS.<br />\nFound in a Bottle\" in a contest sponsored by the Baltimore Sunday<br />\nVisitor. Poe wrote many stories dur-<br />\n<br />\nFeatures Features Featur<br />\n<br />\npublic, and operated it for 30 years.<br />\nIn 1979, the City of Baltimore acquired the house, which was then<br />\nclosed for restoration. The house was<br />\nreopened in 1981, and according to<br />\ncurator Jeff Jerome, over 5000 people visited the house in the following<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe small size of the Poe house<br />\nlimits the activities which can be held<br />\nthere. Each year there is a<br />\n\"Christmas at the Poe House\" in<br />\nwhich both Christmas decorations<br />\nand live music from Poe's time are<br />\nfeatured. Traditionally, this is held<br />\non the day before the house is closed<br />\nfor the holidays. In the past, an effort has been made to avoid doing<br />\nspecial things at the Poe house for<br />\nHalloween because Poe did not actually write many ghost or other<br />\n<br />\nFeatures<br />\n<br />\n\fHasn'tFallen Yet<br />\nIn 1924, the Edgar Allan Poe<br />\nSociety of Baltimore was founded by<br />\nDr. John Calvin French, an English<br />\nprofessor at Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nSociety was formed for two purposes:<br />\n1) to maintain Poe's gravesite; and 2)<br />\nto organize annual commemorations<br />\nof Poe. Today the gravesite is taken<br />\ncare of by the Westminster trust of<br />\nthe University of Maryland Law<br />\nSchool, so, according to Alexander<br />\nRose, historian and secretarytreasurer of the Poe Socithe<br />\nremaining<br />\npurety,<br />\npose of the Society now is to publish<br />\neach year the commemoration<br />\nspeech, and make it available to Poe<br />\nscholars everywhere. The speeches<br />\nare always given on the first Sunday<br />\nin October at the annual fall meeting<br />\nof the society. Giving the speech is<br />\nconsidered a great honor; speakers<br />\nare lined up through 1991.<br />\nThe society also acts as a clearinghouse for any information about<br />\nPoe. Rose estimates that each year<br />\nbetween 200 and 300 information requests are handled by the society.<br />\n\u20220 n<br />\nMarch<br />\n18,<br />\n1983,<br />\nthe Poe Society is sponsoring a symposium entitled \"What the College<br />\nStudents of the '80s Think of Poe.\"<br />\nThe society hopes to have a student<br />\nfrom each of the colleges in the<br />\nBaltimore area present a short paper<br />\non Poe. On behalf of the Poe Society, Rose extends an invitation to any<br />\nHopkins student who has a serious<br />\namateur's interest in Poe to contact<br />\nhim about the symposium at<br />\n435-8281.<br />\nThere is much about Edgar Allan<br />\nPoe's life and death that is and will<br />\nremain unknown. This is partly<br />\nbecause efforts to collect Poe's<br />\nbiographical data began late, and<br />\nalso because Poe himself left no<br />\ndiaries and almost no personal correspondence. Nevertheless, Baltimore<br />\nis regarded by many Poe scholars as<br />\nthe home of Poe, and his roots here<br />\nare clearly evident.<br />\n<br />\nHalloween-type stories. However,<br />\nmany people inquire each year what<br />\nthe Poe house is going to do for<br />\nHalloween, and this year dramatic<br />\nreadings of Poe's \"The Tell-Tale<br />\nHeart\" and \"The Black Cat\" were<br />\npresented. This Halloween program<br />\nof readings was very well received<br />\nand many people had to be turned<br />\naway because the house simply could<br />\nnot hold them all. Jerome says he was<br />\nvery pleased with the program and<br />\nanother one will be presented next<br />\nHalloween.<br />\nThe house on Amity Street is not<br />\nthe only place in Baltimore where Poe<br />\nlived. When he first came to the city, he lived in his aunt's boarding<br />\nhouse, located somewhere along the<br />\npresent-day 900 block of Eastern<br />\nAvenue, between High and Exeter<br />\nstreets. The block stands intact today,<br />\nbut despite extensive research,<br />\nscholars do not know which house it<br />\nis that Poe lived in.<br />\nWhen Poe died, he was buried in<br />\nhis grandfather's cemetery plot.<br />\nThree years later, in 1852, Westminster Church was built. The church<br />\nblocked easy access to Poe's grave,<br />\nso in 1875 the grave was relocated to<br />\nthe southeast corner of the burial<br />\ngrounds. In 1885, his wife's grave<br />\nwas moved from New York to<br />\nBaltimore, and her body and that of<br />\nPoe's aunt now rest alongside that of<br />\nPoe.

I think<br />\nthis is one of the reasons my parents<br />\nlike me so much, and let me reverse<br />\nthe charges when I call them.<br />\nBut, don't get the impression that<br />\nI don't think about causing trouble,<br />\nbecause I do. It's just that I've been<br />\nable to suppress these thoughts, and<br />\nI might add that the world is damn<br />\nlucky I have.<br />\nHere is a list of a few crimes I considered performing, just to prove to<br />\nyou that I have the potential to be<br />\njust as vicious as the next guy.<br />\nMURDER<br />\nMrs. Wilkinson lives across the street<br />\nfrom us in a little two-story house.<br />\nShe's got this big, hairy mole on her<br />\nlower lip, and she always pretends<br />\nshe's not home on Halloween. She<br />\nwas always mean, but she became the<br />\nundisputed \"Meanest Person in Northern New Jersey\" when her husband<br />\nStan mysteriously left her right after<br />\nKarl Wallenda died.<br />\nWell, this one time I was clearing<br />\noff Mrs. Wilkinson's driveway with<br />\nmy dad's new Sears snowblower, and<br />\nshe slipped and fell on a slick spot<br />\nwhen she came out to pay me.<br />\nBecause of this, she refused to give<br />\nme any of the $7 she had promised,<br />\nand I got really mad because my dad<br />\nmakes me pay for the gas I use, so<br />\nI would've lost money on the deal.<br />\nWhen she turned around to walk<br />\nback inside, I thought about running<br />\nher down with the snowblower, sending little bits of her all over the banks<br />\nof snow. But I didn't, and my mom<br />\ncalled Mrs. Wilkinson up and got her<br />\nto give me half the money.<br />\nBRINGING A DRINK INTO A<br />\nGREETING CARD SHOP<br />\n1 was really going to do this once<br />\nat the Paramus Park Mall, but by the<br />\ntime I got up the courage to do it I<br />\nhad pretty much finished my Sprite<br />\nand only had a cup full of ice. Still,<br />\nif it means anything to you, I have<br />\nbrought greeting cards into drink<br />\nshops without being detained for<br />\nquestioning.<br />\nSHOPLIFTING<br />\nI was considering stealing a Ray<br />\nFosse autographed catcher's mitt<br />\nfrom J.C. Penney once, but I changed my mind when I couldn't think up<br />\na way to explain it to my parents.<br />\nBut, just for fun, I grabbed a ski<br />\njacket with one of those heavy plastic<br />\ntags on it and heaved it through the<br />\ndoors just to hear what the alarm<br />\nsounded like.<br />\nASSAULT<br />\nAfter Sarah Helton beat me out by<br />\none vote for homeroom milk monitor<br />\n(two of my best buddies voted for her<br />\nbecause she had promised to show<br />\nthem her panties during recess), I<br />\nconsidered tackling her and cutting<br />\noff all of her long, blonde hair. But<br />\nI didn't do it since the only scissors<br />\nI had in my desk had rounded edges,<br />\nand I forgot to bring in some sharp<br />\nones from home on Monday.<br />\n<br />\nINDECENT EXPOSURE<br />\nLast year, while walking home<br />\nfrom a frat party, I suddenly had the<br />\nincredible need to go to the<br />\nbathroom. Since I was about eight<br />\nblocks from my apartment, I decided to relieve myself in the bushes.<br />\nAnyhow, I was so afraid that the<br />\ncops would show up and shine a<br />\nspotlight on me that I completely<br />\nforgot to unzip my pants, and ended<br />\nup ruining my brand new Frye boots<br />\nand a couple dollar bills that I had<br />\nin my front pocket.<br />\nMURDER<br />\nOnce I was mowing Mrs. Wilkinson's front yard with my dad's new<br />\nSears riding lawnmower when her<br />\nratty old Siamese cat came running<br />\nout of nowhere, got caught in the<br />\nrotary blades, and got sliced up pretty<br />\ngood. Mrs. Wilkinson refused to give<br />\nme the $10 we had agreed upon, and<br />\nI contemplated running her down<br />\nwith the lawnmower, shooting little<br />\nparticles of her all over'the yard like<br />\nfertilizer. But I didn't.<br />\n<br />\nKILLING A PRAYING MANTIS<br />\nI would've smushed this praying<br />\nmantis that I discovered behind some<br />\nold tires in our garage if my sister<br />\nhadn't threatened to call the<br />\nauthorities. I figured that this wasn't<br />\nsomething I'd want to show up on my<br />\nrecord when I applied to colleges,<br />\nanyway. Still, just to get it out of my<br />\nsystem, I crushed a bunch of crickets<br />\nwith a basketball and pretended that<br />\nthey were praying mantises.<br />\n<br />\nMURDER<br />\nMy cousin Tommy is a real jerk,<br />\nand none of my brothers or sisters<br />\ncan stand him, either, so they always<br />\ngo out when they know he's coming<br />\nover. He wears his pants really, really high so that you can see his socks.<br />\nHe calls my parents by their first<br />\nnames, and he always has his fingers<br />\nin one of his facial orifices. Anyway,<br />\nwe were once in a big pile in a tackle<br />\nfootball game, and I reached in to try<br />\nto choke him to death. I was squeezing hard, but I just ended up cutting<br />\noff the circulation in his wrist.<br />\n<br />\nMATRICIDE<br />\nAfter a really bad night's sleep, I<br />\nalmost slashed up a Sealy<br />\nPosturepedic with my Cub Scout<br />\nknife.<br />\nWALKING RA REFOOT INTO A<br />\n-McDON A LDS<br />\nMy friend Tony (who holds the<br />\ndistinction of being the only person<br />\nin Wyckoff, N.J., ever to eat a like<br />\nrodent) dared me to do this one daN<br />\nwhen we got back form the shore.<br />\nBut, just before I was going to do it,<br />\n1 remembered what my mom always<br />\nsaid, \"It doesn't take a man to do<br />\nsomething stupid; it takes a man to<br />\nknow when to say no.\" So I changed my mind.

The single (B-side: a<br />\nSpringsteen-esque arrangement of<br />\n\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\") was<br />\ncompleted, pressed, and ready for<br />\nrelease by early September, with the umbrella title Bruce Springstone: Live at<br />\nBedrock and jacket illustrations by<br />\nEbersberger (front) and Chalkley<br />\n(reverse).<br />\nWIYY-FM's morning D.J. Bob<br />\nLopez(who had been at the Klein concert) wanted to premiere the record on<br />\nhis show; he got his wish in midSeptember, and for three weeks following tlte. record's release \"Bruce<br />\nSpringstone\" was being heard not only<br />\nduring drive-time but at least twice a day<br />\non each of the station's other programs.<br />\nAt the same time the song was also getting moderate play on WFBR-AM,<br />\ncourtesy of D.J. Johnny Walker.<br />\nThen came Philadelphia. Within two<br />\nweeks of Tearson's coup, \"(Meet the)<br />\nFlintstones\" was added not only to<br />\nWMMR's playlist but also to that of<br />\nrival station WYSP. Rock critic Ken<br />\nTucker's mention of the song(complete<br />\nwith Clean Cuts' address) in the<br />\nSeptember 26 edition of the<br />\nPhiladelphia Inquirer generated about<br />\n400 mail-order requests for the single.<br />\nAnd slowly, other cities became<br />\ninterested.<br />\nThe Springstone record has now been<br />\nentered on station playlists in no less<br />\nthan 15 markets nationwide; it has been<br />\nwritten up in the Village Voice,- featured<br />\non Dr. Demento's nationally syndicated<br />\nradio show, and chosen as a Billboard<br />\n<br />\nmagazine \"pick-hit\"; and it has caught<br />\nthe attention of MTV, the New Yorkbased cable music channel, which has<br />\nshown interest in doing a feature story<br />\non Chalkley et al. Of an initial pressing<br />\nof 10,000 records, an estiniated 2000<br />\nhave been sold so far in just the<br />\nBaltimore area (sales figures for other<br />\ncities are not yet available), and a special<br />\npressing of 3000 12-inch singles (due<br />\nmostly to radio-station demand) has just<br />\nbeen shipped. (It is uncertain whether<br />\nSpringsteen himself has heard the song,<br />\nalthough he has been sent a copy. Jon<br />\nLandau, Springsteen's manager, and his<br />\nstaff have heard it and have given the<br />\nproject their blessing.)<br />\nHankin realizes that one can't expect<br />\nto go too far on what is basically a<br />\nnovelty song. He and Chalkley plan to<br />\nreturn to the studio in November or<br />\nDecember to record another single,<br />\n\"Shampoo,\" again with Heyrman as<br />\nproducer. They also plan to return to<br />\nlive performing, with a few lineup<br />\nchanges: engineer Carr replacing Keene<br />\non guitar, and Greg Lief, from a D.C.<br />\nband called Graphic Shadows, replacing<br />\nShaw on keyboards. According to<br />\nNankin, the diversity of instrumental<br />\nand songwriting styles within the band<br />\nensures that future projects won't sound<br />\nlike E-Street clonings. \"That was a<br />\ndefinite effect we were going for [with<br />\nthe Springsteen parody],\" he says. \"Our<br />\nown stuff won't be relying too heavily<br />\non sax and organ; our songs don't sound<br />\nlike Springsteen songs.

White<br />\nAthletic Center last Saturday.<br />\nBut under the warm, Indian<br />\nsummer sun, most of the celebrating was done outside on the<br />\n. Homewood turf\u2014as the Blue<br />\nJay football team claimed their<br />\nthird straight victim by crushing<br />\nthe Wilkes Colonials 42-0.<br />\nPlaying with a ruthless<br />\nvengeance since their 0-4 outset,<br />\nCoach Pfeifer's gridmen showed no mercy again this week,<br />\njumping out to a stunning 28-0<br />\nhalftime lead over the visiting<br />\nColonials, and handing them<br />\ntheir sixteenth straight setback<br />\n:<br />\nThe Hopkins defense, showing flashes of brilliance<br />\nthroughout the season, finally<br />\nseems to be closing in on its true<br />\npotential. The main reason has<br />\nbeen the poise and confidence<br />\nestablished by a once inexperienced, youthful Blue Jay<br />\nbackfield, coupled with the jelling of a veteran offensive line.<br />\nFinishing with a total of 460<br />\nyards of offense on the day, the<br />\nbrunt of the Hopkins attack<br />\n<br />\nwas again carried by the<br />\nfreshman class.<br />\nFreshman quarterback Mark<br />\nCampbell, improving with each<br />\nadditional game, directed the<br />\nexplosive Blue Jay attack,<br />\n<br />\nStromberg. Hoheb scored two<br />\ntouchdowns, while Stromberg<br />\nadded another on a 71-yard<br />\njaunt, and finished the day with<br />\nfour carries for 111 yards.

Males and females 18<br />\nand over are eligible to take<br />\npart, but must report to the<br />\nEmergency Room at Union<br />\nMemorial Hospital within 36<br />\nhours of the injury. Since the<br />\nstudy requires several visits,<br />\nparticipants will receive<br />\nrenumeration of $100 upon<br />\ncompletion of treatment.<br />\nDMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide,<br />\nhas been touted by many as a<br />\n\"wonder drug\" which heals a<br />\nlot of injuries, including sprained ankles, at a remarkable<br />\nspeed. There is still uncertainty, however, about how DMSO<br />\nworks and what its side effects<br />\nare<br />\nDMSO is believed to work by<br />\nabsorbing the fluid causing the<br />\nswelling, alleviating the pressure caused by the inflammation, and therefore ending the<br />\npain. The drug remains a<br />\nmystery, though, in that it acts<br />\ndifferently on different individuals. The effects of DMSO<br />\nvary greatly from person to person. The drug is even unpredictable when used by the same<br />\nperson more than once; it may<br />\nrelieve pain one week and fail<br />\nto do so the next.<br />\nIn the past, DMSO users<br />\nhave reported many side effects. The most common side<br />\n<br />\neffect is a strong garlic taste and<br />\nbody odor. Also DMSO may,<br />\ndepending on skin tolerance,<br />\ncause irritation to the area<br />\nwhere it is applied. It is believed that higher concentrations of<br />\nthe drug are more effective in<br />\nrelieving the pain, but they may<br />\ncause more irritation. The area<br />\nto which the DMSO is to be applied must be cleaned thoroughly before the drug iS used.<br />\nThis is because DMSO is a<br />\nstrong solvent and is able to<br />\npenetrate the skin rapidly.<br />\nThus, it is able to transport dirt<br />\nparticles present on the surface<br />\nof the skin through the skin and<br />\ninto the body.<br />\nIn addition, although no<br />\ncases of toxicity have been<br />\nreported, there is (as there is<br />\nwith any drug) a possibility of<br />\nan allergic reaction.<br />\nMost DMSO users have<br />\nreported only the strong garlic<br />\ntaste and odor as side effects.<br />\nMany have described the side<br />\neffects as minor compared to<br />\n'the benefits of the drug. Sports<br />\nfigures who have made extensive successful use of DMSO include Alberto Salazar and Jim<br />\nPalmer.<br />\n<br />\nThe patient will be instfucted<br />\nin the proper application of<br />\nDMSO. During the treatment<br />\nDMSO will be applied externally, three times a day, by the patient from his mid-calf area to<br />\nhis toes.'The treatment will last<br />\nfor about a week and the patient will be required to report<br />\nto the Sports Medicine Center<br />\nonce a day for seven days.<br />\nFor further information contact Mr. Lonny Connelly,<br />\nP.A., at the Union Memorial<br />\nSports Medicine Center by calling 235-7200.<br />\n<br />\nGettsburg back dribbles through .1:0 defense.<br />\n<br />\nBooters Finally Put It Together<br />\nBY BRUCE SOLITAR<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins soccer<br />\nteam finally played up to its<br />\npotential and recorded two<br />\nstrong wins in the past week.<br />\nTheir record now stands at<br />\n4-8-1.<br />\nLast Friday night at Homewood Field, the Jays put forth<br />\ntheir finest performance of the<br />\nseason.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium. Drawing mainly<br />\nfrom his column, Anderson<br />\nentertained and informed the<br />\naudience of 700 for two hours.<br />\nHe began by justifying his<br />\nuse of unauthorized sources for<br />\ninformation.<br />\n\"Anywhere else in the nation,\" he said, \"reporters go to<br />\nthe newsmakers for news.<br />\nThat's not the case in<br />\nWashington. The newsmakers<br />\nthere are politicians. Politicians<br />\nonly give you authorized<br />\nnews\u2014what they want you to<br /><br />\nJack Anderson<br /><br />\nknow. The role of the newsman<br />\nis to dig up what government is<br />\ntrying to cover up.\"<br />\nAnderson uses the same<br />\nsources of information that the<br />\npresident receives: intelligence<br />\nreports from office aides,<br />\ncabinet members and the various committees and agencies in<br />\nWashington. He expressed surprise at the number of crises<br />\nwhich he had known of in advance, but of which the presi-<br /><br />\ndent didn't seem to know.<br />\nOne example which he cited<br />\nwas that former President Nixon was warned of an oil shortage and given a dozen choices,<br />\nany one of which would have<br />\nprevented the shortage. All<br />\nwere possibly harmful to him<br />\npolitically, so Nixon decided to<br />\nleave the matter alone until<br />\nafter the next election. The<br />\nresult was the 40-fold jump in<br />\noil prices, Andersbn stated.<br />\nHe then read on stage the<br />\nMarch 6, 1981 column that he<br />\nhad written warning the public<br />\nof an Israeli incursion into<br />\nLebanon, 15 months before the<br />\nactual invasion.<br />\nThis brought up the subject<br />\nof the Soviet invasion of<br />\nAfghanistan. Angered by<br />\nformer President Carter's<br />\nastonishment at the invasion,<br /><br />\nSunpaper Publisher Reg Murphy<br />\nConcludes '82 MSE Symposium<br />\nBY CATHERINE RAEFF<br />\nPresident of the A.S. Abell<br />\nPublishing Co. and publisher<br />\nof the Sunpapers for the last<br />\nsixteen months, Reg Murphy,<br />\nspoke to an audience of about<br />\n200 at Monday evening's MSE<br />\nSymposium on the future of<br />\nprint and electronic media.<br />\nMurphy's speech on the \"Marriage of Print and Electronic<br />\nMedia\" was the last of the<br />\nseries.<br />\nWith the rise of the computer<br />\nage, there has been misleading<br />\nevidence that the newspaper is<br />\ndying. However, with each<br />\nshutdown, 20 new papers are<br />\nestablished, and Murphy added, \"circulation is as high as it<br />\nhas ever been\" and \"things<br />\nhave begun to happen in print<br />\nthat are encouraging.\" Nevertheless, Murphy said \"I began<br />\nto worry how I [could] put<br />\ntogether a diversified package<br />\nfor people to find the. most important and interesting information...on a constant basis.\"<br />\nMurphy's first step in the<br />\nstrategic plan to give different<br />\npeople the information they<br />\nfind individually most interesting was to add to the<br />\nEvening and Morning Sun to<br />\n\"give people a reason to read<br />\nboth papers and to make both<br />\ninteresting to people who have<br />\ndifferent interests in the community.\" In order to give people information they want when<br />\nthey want it, it is necessary to<br />\nintroduce electronic information which Murphy said \"is<br />\ntart of the information system<br /><br />\nof the future.\"<br />\nTo participate in the new<br />\nsystem, the Sunpapers are<br />\nbecoming part of the Viewtron<br />\ncomputer system which will<br />\nenable the reader to obtain the<br />\ninformation he needs at any<br />\ngiven moment. In simple terms,<br />\na reader will have. a modicum<br />\nconnected to his television and<br />\na key pad with the numbers one<br />\nto ten and zero on it. One punches the pad to dial one's phone<br />\ninto the Viewtron computer,<br />\nwhich is in turn hooked up to<br />\nthe modicum through the<br />\nphone. The program is then<br />\ntransmitted to the television<br />\nscreen. A choice of subjects and<br />\ntheir respective code numbers<br />\nwill appear on the screen, and<br />\nthen the reader can punch the<br />\nappropriate numbers into his<br />\npad to receive the information<br />\nhe wants. Information from<br />\nany Sunpaper can be obtained,<br />\nand it will be continually<br />\nupdated.<br />\nAlthough it is still in its experimental stages, Murphy believes that the Viewtron system<br />\nwill become more and more<br />\npopular in the BaltimoreWashington metropolitan area,<br />\nand by 1985 will be put into<br />\npractical use for all. He said<br />\nthat the entire American communications system is experiencing a revolution resulting t'rom<br />\nthe recent loosening of federal<br />\nregulations in that area. The<br />\nmanner in which people spend<br />\ntime and money to obtain information has also gone<br />\nthrough radical changes.

Subscriptions SIO per annum.( irculation 7o00.<br /><br />\nA Crucial Time For Planning<br />\nThe difficulties inherent in developing a<br />\n\"master plan\" outlining the direction and<br />\ngoals of a university arc tremendous<br />\nHowever, the financial crunch that is currently impinging on Hopkins and which promises to remain in the future makes such<br />\nplanning imperative. With Hopkins' 1984-89<br />\n\"Capital Campaign\" approaching, both the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences and the School<br />\nof Engineering were asked to prepare reports<br />\nfor the fund raising drive. These reports, still<br />\nin the process of being completed;serve two<br />\nfunctions. They depict Hopkins as an attractive investment for business and industry,<br />\nand they allow the schools to state their needs<br />\nand goals. However the divisions must first<br />\ndecide these needs and define these goals.<br />\nThe reports provide an excellent opportunity<br />\nto establish a clear direction for the<br />\nHomewood divisions of the University.<br />\nThe Engineering School has the easiest<br />\ntask. The Engineering division is rapidly<br />\ngrowing and will continue to expand. It expects to gain additional faculty and students.<br />\nThe preliminary draft of the Engineering<br />\nSchool report is upbeat; it will entice potential investors. Yet the preliminary draft has<br />\nelicted some faculty complaints. Some have<br />\nargued that it does not establish clear<br />\npriorities. However the lack of clear<br />\npriorities will probably not hurt the<br />\nEngineering School during the Capital Campaign. The division produces students who<br />\nhave the knowledge of modern technology<br />\nthat industry needs. The advantages of industry investment are obvious. The Arts and<br />\nSciences division has much more serious<br />\nproblems.<br />\nThe Arts and Sciences division is not<br /><br />\ngrowing, and as a whole does not expect the<br />\ndo so in the near future. Due to this prospect<br />\nand because the advantages for industry investment are not obvious, the need for a<br />\ncoherent, comprehensive plan is paramount.<br />\nIn this respect, the Christ Committee report<br />\nfor the Arts and Sciences division leaves<br />\nmuch to be desired. This is reflected by the<br />\nextent of faculty criticism. The report fails<br />\nto convey any sense of where the school<br />\nwants to go during the next decade. In<br />\noutlining priorities, it eschews politically sensitive issues. Certainly everybody favors<br />\nlibrary improvements, visiting professorships<br />\nand post-doctoral fellowships. But as<br />\nPolitical Economy Professor Bela Balassa<br />\nstressed at last week's General Assembly<br />\nmeeting, a much more serious problem lies<br />\nin the declining quality of many Arts and<br />\nSciences departments. However, once one<br />\nbegins to target certain areas of need,<br />\npolitical tensions invariably mount.<br />\nAlthough the Christ report does emphasize<br />\nimportant issues such as financial aid and<br />\nan effort to concentrate on astrophysics (an<br />\nobvious choice for growth because of the<br />\npresence of the Space Telescope Institute),<br />\nit must go much further in establishing<br />\npriorities and general goals for the division.<br />\nOtherwise the division may face ten more<br />\nyears of what Physics Professor J.C. Walker<br />\ntermed, \"flubbing around as usual.\" For<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences division, the task of effective planning in a no-growth environment<br />\nis difficult yet essential in terms of efficiency and selling the division. For the sake of<br />\nthe University's future, it is hoped that the<br />\nChrist Committee will not end up as another<br />\nopportunity lost.<br /><br />\nCongress And Student Aid<br />\nAs far as students are concerned, probably<br />\nthe most important issue on the national<br />\npolitical scene is financial aid. The effect of'<br />\nthis week's elections on student aid prospects<br />\nare likely to be positive. Although it is<br />\nunlikely that the new Congress will be able<br />\nto reverse the trends of the past two years,<br />\nfurther efforts to reduce federal assistance<br />\nwill likely be stymied.<br />\nIn preparation for the 1983 budget, the<br />\nReagan administration had proposed severe<br />\ncutbacks in funds for National Direct Student Loans, Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grants and funds for Work Study.<br /><br />\nThere was even talk of eliminating<br />\nGuaranteed Student Loans. These programs<br />\nnow appear to be safe.<br />\nThe likelihood for any increase in federal<br />\naid for students is minimal and would probably occur only if a decrease in military expenditures allowed additional funds to be<br />\ndiverted to social programs. The chances of<br />\nthis occurring remain small. Nevertheless, the<br />\ngood news is that it seems as though for at<br />\nleast two years, the conservative trends that<br />\nhave wiped away student aid benefits have<br />\nbeen ground to a halt.<br /><br />\nExpensive Incompetence<br />\nEight thousand dollars is a lot of money.<br />\nStudents at one point risked this loss.<br />\nat the Clarence Clemons concert due to poor<br />\nplanning by the chairpersons of the Speaker<br />\nand Concert Committee. Their incompetence<br />\nhas threatened all student social activities for<br />\nthe rest of this year.<br />\nChairpersons Tina Bovis and Jell Aronoff<br />\napparently made the decision to get Clemons<br />\nagainst the wishes of their committee. Their<br />\nchoice necessitated high ticket prices that<br />\nhave turned away many students. Even so,<br />\nwith a good publicity campaign they should<br />\nhave had no problem selling out the show.<br />\nPeople who have seen Clemons in concert<br /><br />\nin the past can attest that he is a good performer. There are certainly enough students<br />\naround who would be willing to pay seven<br />\ndollars to see a good show. Yet again Bovis<br />\nand Aronoll failed. They pursued their<br />\nduties in a nonaggressive manner that<br />\nresulted in few ticket sales on and off campus. As a result the Student Council has been<br />\nforced to take up much of the work. Ticket<br />\nsales are now picking up, as should be expected. Yet the irresponsibility of the<br />\nSpeaker and Concert Committee chairpersons must not be overlooked. The Student<br />\nCouncil must be more careful of its appointments in the future.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nSecurity And Free Speech Rights Denied<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to thank Grant<br />\nLally for his fine letter instructing the Student Council to deal<br />\nwith real campus issues rather<br />\nthan toying with petty concerns, because this is what the<br />\ncouncil has been trying to do all<br />\nalong.<br />\nPerhaps Mr. Lally only reads<br />\nthose News-Letter articles<br />\nwhich mention himself, or else<br />\nhe would have noticed the Student Council's work on traffic<br />\nsafety, dorm renovations,<br />\ntenure policy, TAs, and financial aid.<br />\nIf these endeavors have not<br />\nreceived proper note on campus, and if certain trivialities<br />\nappear to occupy the council's<br />\ntime, then the student body is<br />\ngetting a distorted image of<br />\nwhat its elected officers are<br />\ndoing.<br />\nGrant, if you indeed desire<br />\nthat the council deal with real<br />\nissues, may I suggest that you<br />\naid in this by ceasing to present<br />\nyour inane constitutional<br /><br />\namendments, name changes,<br />\nand weekly petitions to the<br />\ncouncil.<br />\nPerhaps all of the time you<br />\ndevote to trying to generate<br />\nhatred for the Student Council<br />\nand to writing impractical constitutions (the latest of which<br />\ncontains something resembling<br />\nThe People's Court) that will<br />\nonly slow down efforts to better student life at Hopkins<br />\ncould be better spent working<br />\nfor the SAC groups you claim<br />\nto represent.<br />\nGrant enjoys harassing the<br />\nStudent Council until the council has to snap back in defense.<br />\nThen he claims that it was the<br />\ncouncil that struck first.<br />\nPerhaps it is time to drop these<br />\nchildish games and grow up a<br />\nbit.

Mitchell, was in<br />\nBaltimore's Inner Harbor.<br />\nThrough the efforts of<br />\nBaltimore's mayor, William<br />\nSchaefer, the National Oceanic<br />\nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) presented a<br />\nspecial exhibition of the activities of NOAA. Along with<br />\nthe exhibition were tours of the<br />\nMt. Mitchell. This special<br />\nvisitation of Baltimore by the<br />\nship was part of a program to<br />\npromote the various programs<br />\nof NOAA.<br /><br />\ngovernment into one entity.<br />\nOne of the many programs<br />\nwithin NOAA is the National<br />\nOcean Survey. Its purpose is to<br />\nstudy and chart the ocean bottom. It allows the safe navigation of the sea by merchants,<br />\nwith vessels ranging in size from<br />\nfishing boats to oil tankers, by<br />\nyachtsmen and by the Navy.<br />\nThe hydrographic surveys are,<br />\nhowever, \u2022 limited to the territorial waters of the U.S. One<br />\nof the critical components of<br />\nthis surveying is the Mt.<br />\nMitchell.<br />\nThe Mt. Mitchell is a part of<br />\nthe NOAA fleet of about 22<br />\nvessels. Some of these ships are<br />\nas long as 300 feet, while others<br /><br />\nallows for the efficient processing of hydrographic data. Each<br />\nof the four launches carries<br />\n'three to four people and the<br />\ncorresponding research equipment. Since the ship also<br />\noperates over extended periods<br />\nof time, it contains equipment<br />\nthat can produce up to 3,000<br />\ngallons of fresh water a day.<br />\nThe staff of the Mt. Mitchell<br />\nincludes a crew of 70 and 13<br />\ncommissioned officers. The<br />\nessential nature of having a<br />\ncompetent ,:rew working alongside the officers is emphasized<br />\nby the envirorment that all<br />\nwork in. During bad weather,<br />\nthere is a great reliance on skilled sailors in both the launches<br /><br />\nNew<br />\nnglarPizz<br />\na<br />\nvi<br /><br />\nHot and Cold Subs<br /><br />\nSouvlaki<br />\nGyros<br />\nUniversity and 33rd St.<br />\nDaily: 10 AM -2 AM<br />\nPhone ahead : 467 - 1022<br /><br />\nto\"<br /><br />\n, ,.\u2022<br /><br />\nhi<br /><br />\nTHE END<br />\nTO<br />\nSTUDENT UNREST<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n00100111....<br />\nEl:.<br /><br />\n11/111111rt<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nlb?<br /><br />\n111111111111111P\"..<br /><br />\nipoxis<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\na94.111!\".\"\"---711<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\noF<br /><br />\n\u2022'<br />\n1.\u2022<br /><br />\n..7\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nAmong the activities that the<br />\nexhibition displayed were the<br />\nNational Weather Service, the<br />\nemergency broadcast system,<br />\n.and hydrographic surveying.<br />\nThe last, hydrographic surveying, which involves the mapping of the ocean bottom, is the<br />\nprimary activity of the Mt.<br />\nMitchell.<br />\nThe arrival of the Mt. Mitchell in Baltimore's harbor<br />\ncoincided almost exactly, with<br />\nthe twelfth anniversary of the<br />\nformation of NOAA as a part<br />\nof the U.S. Department of<br />\nCommerce. This date marked<br />\nthe consolidation of many of<br />\nthe marine and weather research activities of the federal<br /><br />\nommissioned officer<br /><br />\nare no longer than fishing<br />\nboats. The Mt. Mitchell is a<br />\nclass II vessel, is 231 feet long,<br />\nand has a maximum width of<br />\n42 feet. The longest vessels(the<br />\nclass I ships) are almost floating<br />\nhotels for scientists.<br />\nFor its hydrographic surveying, the Mt. Mitchell is outfitted with modern electronic<br />\npositioning systems, precision<br />\ndepth recorders and a cornputerized data acquisition<br />\nsystem. The Mt. Mitchell carries four survey launches, each<br />\nof which can operate in as little as 30 feet of water, and two<br />\nof which are equipped with<br />\ndata acquisition systems identical to those on the ship.

This certain atmosphere has been said to be<br />\ngreater on the Mt. Mitchell<br />\nthan on other research vessels,<br />\nlargely because of the efforts of<br />\nall those aboard the ship to<br />\nmake it that way.<br />\n-One of the ship's officers,<br />\nFred Rossman, provided many<br />\ninteresting insights into thL<br />\noperation of the ship. Among<br />\nthe items he mentioned was Eh(<br />\nfact that commissioned officer,<br />\naboard the vessel control thc<br />\nnavigation and propulsion of<br />\nthe ship, and are also engaged<br />\nin the survey work. These officers, divided into senior and<br />\njunior officers, must have a<br />\nbachelor degree in science or<br />\nengineering.<br />\nFred Rossman, an officer for<br />\ntwo years, pointed out that<br />\ncommissioned officers aboard<br />\nthe Mt. Mitchell and all other<br />\nNOAA vessels are members of<br />\nthe NOAA Corps of Officers,<br />\none of the seven uniformed services in the U.S. today.-While<br />\nnot extremely large (the entire<br />\ncorps has less than 400<br />\nmembers), the corps provides a<br />\nvery adequate source of trained individuals to run the<br />\nNOAA's research vessels.<br />\nAmong the officers, the<br />\nsenior officers are permanent<br />\nofficers.

He lived in various houses<br />\nthroughout the city, and one, at 203<br />\nN. Amity Street, has been restored<br />\nand is now open to the public. In<br />\n1849, while passing through Baltimore, Poe died and was buried in<br />\nthe western burial grounds at<br />\nWestminster Church. There is an<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore, founded over 60 years ago to<br />\nhonor Poe, which now has members<br />\nfrom all over the world.<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe, known today as<br />\na master of the short story and the<br />\ninventor of the detective story, was<br />\nborn in 1809. Orphaned at an early<br />\nage, he grew up in Richmond, Virginia, under the care of Mr. and Mrs.<br />\nJohn Allan. Edgar's relations with<br />\nthe Allans were never good, and as<br />\nhe grew older, the tension between<br />\nthem grew. After many unfortunate<br />\nincidents, Poe left Richmond and<br />\nenlisted in the Army. He received his<br /><br />\nRestaurant Review<br /><br />\nPoe<br />\ning these years, including \"Berenice\"<br />\nand \"A Descent into the Maelstrom.\" Poe married his cousin<br />\nVirginia in 1836, and then moved to<br />\nRichmond, where he took the first of<br />\nhis many short-lived editorial positions. They later lived in Philadelphia<br />\nand New York, where Virginia died<br />\nin 1847. During this time Poe became<br />\nfamous for his poem \"The Raven,\"<br />\nhis short stories, and his reviews.<br />\nHowever, he remained poor. Poe<br />\njourneyed to Richmond in 1849, and<br />\nfrom there he headed back north. On<br />\nOctober 3, he was found unconscious<br />\non Lombard Street in Baltimore. He<br />\nwas taken to a hospital, and died four<br />\ndays later.<br />\nPoe lived on Amity Street in a tiny<br />\nrowhouse built some time between<br />\n1825 and 1830. Poe and his relatives<br />\nwere probably the first occupants of<br />\nthe house. Eight other families lived<br />\nin the house at various times until<br />\n1922, when the last family moved<br />\nout. The Poe Society of Baltimore acquired the lease of the house some<br />\ntime after that, opened it to the<br /><br />\nP.J.'s: A Bar With Tables<br />\nBY CHARLIE KRUZANSKY<br />\nWalking in off the street it is easy<br />\nto see why P..1.'5 is called a Pub\u2014it<br />\nis very dark. Using the only light<br />\nsource, the Coke machine, we read<br />\nthe menu for fifteen minutes. There<br />\nare fifteen items on the menu.<br />\nNobody was in a hurry. Prices range<br />\nFrom $2.75 for a chef's salad to $5.50<br />\nfor a shrimp basket. \"N.J.'s<br />\nBurgers's\" are $2.95 and pizza is<br />\n$6.00. I hear it is good. After ordering we waited fifteen more minutes,<br />\nduring which time the waitress<br />\nbrought us our plastic forks, knives<br />\nand spoons.<br />\nCoffee, when it arrived, was served with powdered creamer, sort of<br />\nlike at Memorial Stadium. My turkey<br />\nsandwich was a round of thickly sliced turkey piled onto a white roll. It<br />\nwasn't good. The \"chips,\" served<br />\nwith the sandwich, were chunks of<br />\npotato that seemed to have bypassed<br />\none stage of their preparation\u2014I<br />\nthink it was the cooking stage. A<br />\ncomrade's opinion of the roast beef<br />\nwas \"this isn't good.\"<br />\nThe lukewarm crab soup tasted<br /><br />\nlike Campbell's vegetable with some<br />\ncrab seasoning sprinkled on top.<br />\nEating with a plastic spoon didn't<br />\nhelp.<br />\nWe thought that maybe P.J.'s<br />\nwould be better suited for drinking<br />\nthan eating. Beer is heavily advertised, as is their \"happy hour.\" What<br />\nisn't mentioned is that happy hour<br />\nonly applies to the bar, so a Bud<br />\nsavored sitting at a table will cost<br />\n$1.15. Pitchers are $7.00, and mixed<br />\ndrinks are $1.50 and up.<br />\nBy all indication, it seems that<br />\n13..1.'s Pub is not much more than a<br />\nbar with tables. The food we tried<br />\nwas bad, and the prices are high. But<br />\nI hear the pizza is, good. It is very<br />\ndark, and the tables are so close to<br />\neach other that everyone shares conversation and cigarette smoke. You<br />\nprobably won't feel compelled to<br />\nleave a tip. Names of restaurants<br />\nusually intrigue me, but P.J.'s<br />\ndoesn't: it stands for \"pretty junky.\"<br />\nP.J.'s Pub is located at 3333 North<br />\nCharles St. in the basement QI the<br />\nCharles apartment building.

Here<br />\nhe took to writing. He published a<br />\nfew poems, but most of his work<br />\nwent unpaid.<br />\nFrom 1832 to 1835, Poe lived with<br />\nhis aunt, grandmother and cousin on<br />\nAmity Street. These years of his life<br />\nwere filled with poverty and ill health,<br />\nbut he continued to write. In 1833<br />\nPoe had his first major success: he<br />\nwon the $50 first prize for \"MS.<br />\nFound in a Bottle\" in a contest sponsored by the Baltimore Sunday<br />\nVisitor. Poe wrote many stories dur-<br /><br />\nFeatures Features Featur<br /><br />\npublic, and operated it for 30 years.<br />\nIn 1979, the City of Baltimore acquired the house, which was then<br />\nclosed for restoration. The house was<br />\nreopened in 1981, and according to<br />\ncurator Jeff Jerome, over 5000 people visited the house in the following<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe small size of the Poe house<br />\nlimits the activities which can be held<br />\nthere. Each year there is a<br />\n\"Christmas at the Poe House\" in<br />\nwhich both Christmas decorations<br />\nand live music from Poe's time are<br />\nfeatured. Traditionally, this is held<br />\non the day before the house is closed<br />\nfor the holidays. In the past, an effort has been made to avoid doing<br />\nspecial things at the Poe house for<br />\nHalloween because Poe did not actually write many ghost or other<br /><br />\nFeatures<br /><br />\nHasn'tFallen Yet<br />\nIn 1924, the Edgar Allan Poe<br />\nSociety of Baltimore was founded by<br />\nDr. John Calvin French, an English<br />\nprofessor at Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nSociety was formed for two purposes:<br />\n1) to maintain Poe's gravesite; and 2)<br />\nto organize annual commemorations<br />\nof Poe. Today the gravesite is taken<br />\ncare of by the Westminster trust of<br />\nthe University of Maryland Law<br />\nSchool, so, according to Alexander<br />\nRose, historian and secretarytreasurer of the Poe Socithe<br />\nremaining<br />\npurety,<br />\npose of the Society now is to publish<br />\neach year the commemoration<br />\nspeech, and make it available to Poe<br />\nscholars everywhere. The speeches<br />\nare always given on the first Sunday<br />\nin October at the annual fall meeting<br />\nof the society. Giving the speech is<br />\nconsidered a great honor; speakers<br />\nare lined up through 1991.<br />\nThe society also acts as a clearinghouse for any information about<br />\nPoe. Rose estimates that each year<br />\nbetween 200 and 300 information requests are handled by the society.<br />\n\u20220 n<br />\nMarch<br />\n18,<br />\n1983,<br />\nthe Poe Society is sponsoring a symposium entitled \"What the College<br />\nStudents of the '80s Think of Poe.\"<br />\nThe society hopes to have a student<br />\nfrom each of the colleges in the<br />\nBaltimore area present a short paper<br />\non Poe. On behalf of the Poe Society, Rose extends an invitation to any<br />\nHopkins student who has a serious<br />\namateur's interest in Poe to contact<br />\nhim about the symposium at<br />\n435-8281.<br />\nThere is much about Edgar Allan<br />\nPoe's life and death that is and will<br />\nremain unknown. This is partly<br />\nbecause efforts to collect Poe's<br />\nbiographical data began late, and<br />\nalso because Poe himself left no<br />\ndiaries and almost no personal correspondence. Nevertheless, Baltimore<br />\nis regarded by many Poe scholars as<br />\nthe home of Poe, and his roots here<br />\nare clearly evident.<br /><br />\nHalloween-type stories. However,<br />\nmany people inquire each year what<br />\nthe Poe house is going to do for<br />\nHalloween, and this year dramatic<br />\nreadings of Poe's \"The Tell-Tale<br />\nHeart\" and \"The Black Cat\" were<br />\npresented. This Halloween program<br />\nof readings was very well received<br />\nand many people had to be turned<br />\naway because the house simply could<br />\nnot hold them all. Jerome says he was<br />\nvery pleased with the program and<br />\nanother one will be presented next<br />\nHalloween.<br />\nThe house on Amity Street is not<br />\nthe only place in Baltimore where Poe<br />\nlived. When he first came to the city, he lived in his aunt's boarding<br />\nhouse, located somewhere along the<br />\npresent-day 900 block of Eastern<br />\nAvenue, between High and Exeter<br />\nstreets. The block stands intact today,<br />\nbut despite extensive research,<br />\nscholars do not know which house it<br />\nis that Poe lived in.<br />\nWhen Poe died, he was buried in<br />\nhis grandfather's cemetery plot.<br />\nThree years later, in 1852, Westminster Church was built. The church<br />\nblocked easy access to Poe's grave,<br />\nso in 1875 the grave was relocated to<br />\nthe southeast corner of the burial<br />\ngrounds. In 1885, his wife's grave<br />\nwas moved from New York to<br />\nBaltimore, and her body and that of<br />\nPoe's aunt now rest alongside that of<br />\nPoe. In 1905, a marker was erected<br />\nat Poe's original gravesite, and today<br />\nthere is also a monument over the<br />\nburial site of the three Poes, paid for<br />\nby penny donations from Baltimore<br />\nschoolchildren.<br />\nWestminster Church is located on<br />\nthe corner of Fayette and Greene<br />\nstreets, and the outside of the<br />\ncemetery is open on a daily basis. The<br />\nUniversity of Maryland School of<br />\nLaw now owns the church and maintains the gravesites. This past Sunday, on Halloween, an evening tour<br />\nof the cemetery was given, and over<br />\n1000 people attended.<br /><br />\nEDGAR ALLAN POE<br />\nrfl ON 1<br /><br />\nOCTOBER E. 184U.-)<br />\nON<br /><br />\nNO\\lEMBER 17 1873<br />\n&lt;<br /><br />\nt ,LEJ<br /><br />\n1,<br /><br />\n\u2018;\u2018)TFIER-1;s4<br />\n)<br /><br />\nHY,<br />\n)EIMT FPEC'sitTO<br />\n4it*:\"\"fi<br /><br />\n1 UNDER 4<br />\n?<br />\n4<br /><br />\nHam on Wry<br /><br />\nThis List Is<br />\nAlmost Criminal<br />\nBY MIKE KUN<br />\nNever in my life have I ever had<br />\nany trouble with the police. I think<br />\nthis is one of the reasons my parents<br />\nlike me so much, and let me reverse<br />\nthe charges when I call them.<br />\nBut, don't get the impression that<br />\nI don't think about causing trouble,<br />\nbecause I do. It's just that I've been<br />\nable to suppress these thoughts, and<br />\nI might add that the world is damn<br />\nlucky I have.<br />\nHere is a list of a few crimes I considered performing, just to prove to<br />\nyou that I have the potential to be<br />\njust as vicious as the next guy.<br />\nMURDER<br />\nMrs. Wilkinson lives across the street<br />\nfrom us in a little two-story house.<br />\nShe's got this big, hairy mole on her<br />\nlower lip, and she always pretends<br />\nshe's not home on Halloween. She<br />\nwas always mean, but she became the<br />\nundisputed \"Meanest Person in Northern New Jersey\" when her husband<br />\nStan mysteriously left her right after<br />\nKarl Wallenda died.<br />\nWell, this one time I was clearing<br />\noff Mrs. Wilkinson's driveway with<br />\nmy dad's new Sears snowblower, and<br />\nshe slipped and fell on a slick spot<br />\nwhen she came out to pay me.<br />\nBecause of this, she refused to give<br />\nme any of the $7 she had promised,<br />\nand I got really mad because my dad<br />\nmakes me pay for the gas I use, so<br />\nI would've lost money on the deal.<br />\nWhen she turned around to walk<br />\nback inside, I thought about running<br />\nher down with the snowblower, sending little bits of her all over the banks<br />\nof snow. But I didn't, and my mom<br />\ncalled Mrs. Wilkinson up and got her<br />\nto give me half the money.<br />\nBRINGING A DRINK INTO A<br />\nGREETING CARD SHOP<br />\n1 was really going to do this once<br />\nat the Paramus Park Mall, but by the<br />\ntime I got up the courage to do it I<br />\nhad pretty much finished my Sprite<br />\nand only had a cup full of ice. Still,<br />\nif it means anything to you, I have<br />\nbrought greeting cards into drink<br />\nshops without being detained for<br />\nquestioning.<br />\nSHOPLIFTING<br />\nI was considering stealing a Ray<br />\nFosse autographed catcher's mitt<br />\nfrom J.C. Penney once, but I changed my mind when I couldn't think up<br />\na way to explain it to my parents.<br />\nBut, just for fun, I grabbed a ski<br />\njacket with one of those heavy plastic<br />\ntags on it and heaved it through the<br />\ndoors just to hear what the alarm<br />\nsounded like.<br />\nASSAULT<br />\nAfter Sarah Helton beat me out by<br />\none vote for homeroom milk monitor<br />\n(two of my best buddies voted for her<br />\nbecause she had promised to show<br />\nthem her panties during recess), I<br />\nconsidered tackling her and cutting<br />\noff all of her long, blonde hair. But<br />\nI didn't do it since the only scissors<br />\nI had in my desk had rounded edges,<br />\nand I forgot to bring in some sharp<br />\nones from home on Monday.<br /><br />\nINDECENT EXPOSURE<br />\nLast year, while walking home<br />\nfrom a frat party, I suddenly had the<br />\nincredible need to go to the<br />\nbathroom. Since I was about eight<br />\nblocks from my apartment, I decided to relieve myself in the bushes.<br />\nAnyhow, I was so afraid that the<br />\ncops would show up and shine a<br />\nspotlight on me that I completely<br />\nforgot to unzip my pants, and ended<br />\nup ruining my brand new Frye boots<br />\nand a couple dollar bills that I had<br />\nin my front pocket.<br />\nMURDER<br />\nOnce I was mowing Mrs. Wilkinson's front yard with my dad's new<br />\nSears riding lawnmower when her<br />\nratty old Siamese cat came running<br />\nout of nowhere, got caught in the<br />\nrotary blades, and got sliced up pretty<br />\ngood. Mrs. Wilkinson refused to give<br />\nme the $10 we had agreed upon, and<br />\nI contemplated running her down<br />\nwith the lawnmower, shooting little<br />\nparticles of her all over'the yard like<br />\nfertilizer. But I didn't.<br /><br />\nKILLING A PRAYING MANTIS<br />\nI would've smushed this praying<br />\nmantis that I discovered behind some<br />\nold tires in our garage if my sister<br />\nhadn't threatened to call the<br />\nauthorities. I figured that this wasn't<br />\nsomething I'd want to show up on my<br />\nrecord when I applied to colleges,<br />\nanyway. Still, just to get it out of my<br />\nsystem, I crushed a bunch of crickets<br />\nwith a basketball and pretended that<br />\nthey were praying mantises.<br /><br />\nMURDER<br />\nMy cousin Tommy is a real jerk,<br />\nand none of my brothers or sisters<br />\ncan stand him, either, so they always<br />\ngo out when they know he's coming<br />\nover. He wears his pants really, really high so that you can see his socks.<br />\nHe calls my parents by their first<br />\nnames, and he always has his fingers<br />\nin one of his facial orifices. Anyway,<br />\nwe were once in a big pile in a tackle<br />\nfootball game, and I reached in to try<br />\nto choke him to death. I was squeezing hard, but I just ended up cutting<br />\noff the circulation in his wrist.<br /><br />\nMATRICIDE<br />\nAfter a really bad night's sleep, I<br />\nalmost slashed up a Sealy<br />\nPosturepedic with my Cub Scout<br />\nknife.<br />\nWALKING RA REFOOT INTO A<br />\n-McDON A LDS<br />\nMy friend Tony (who holds the<br />\ndistinction of being the only person<br />\nin Wyckoff, N.J., ever to eat a like<br />\nrodent) dared me to do this one daN<br />\nwhen we got back form the shore.<br />\nBut, just before I was going to do it,<br />\n1 remembered what my mom always<br />\nsaid, \"It doesn't take a man to do<br />\nsomething stupid; it takes a man to<br />\nknow when to say no.\" So I changed my mind.

Of an initial pressing<br />\nof 10,000 records, an estiniated 2000<br />\nhave been sold so far in just the<br />\nBaltimore area (sales figures for other<br />\ncities are not yet available), and a special<br />\npressing of 3000 12-inch singles (due<br />\nmostly to radio-station demand) has just<br />\nbeen shipped. (It is uncertain whether<br />\nSpringsteen himself has heard the song,<br />\nalthough he has been sent a copy. Jon<br />\nLandau, Springsteen's manager, and his<br />\nstaff have heard it and have given the<br />\nproject their blessing.)<br />\nHankin realizes that one can't expect<br />\nto go too far on what is basically a<br />\nnovelty song. He and Chalkley plan to<br />\nreturn to the studio in November or<br />\nDecember to record another single,<br />\n\"Shampoo,\" again with Heyrman as<br />\nproducer. They also plan to return to<br />\nlive performing, with a few lineup<br />\nchanges: engineer Carr replacing Keene<br />\non guitar, and Greg Lief, from a D.C.<br />\nband called Graphic Shadows, replacing<br />\nShaw on keyboards. According to<br />\nNankin, the diversity of instrumental<br />\nand songwriting styles within the band<br />\nensures that future projects won't sound<br />\nlike E-Street clonings. \"That was a<br />\ndefinite effect we were going for [with<br />\nthe Springsteen parody],\" he says. \"Our<br />\nown stuff won't be relying too heavily<br />\non sax and organ; our songs don't sound<br />\nlike Springsteen songs.

The main reason has<br />\nbeen the poise and confidence<br />\nestablished by a once inexperienced, youthful Blue Jay<br />\nbackfield, coupled with the jelling of a veteran offensive line.<br />\nFinishing with a total of 460<br />\nyards of offense on the day, the<br />\nbrunt of the Hopkins attack<br /><br />\nwas again carried by the<br />\nfreshman class.<br />\nFreshman quarterback Mark<br />\nCampbell, improving with each<br />\nadditional game, directed the<br />\nexplosive Blue Jay attack,<br /><br />\nStromberg.

Males and females 18<br />\nand over are eligible to take<br />\npart, but must report to the<br />\nEmergency Room at Union<br />\nMemorial Hospital within 36<br />\nhours of the injury. Since the<br />\nstudy requires several visits,<br />\nparticipants will receive<br />\nrenumeration of $100 upon<br />\ncompletion of treatment.<br />\nDMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide,<br />\nhas been touted by many as a<br />\n\"wonder drug\" which heals a<br />\nlot of injuries, including sprained ankles, at a remarkable<br />\nspeed. There is still uncertainty, however, about how DMSO<br />\nworks and what its side effects<br />\nare<br />\nDMSO is believed to work by<br />\nabsorbing the fluid causing the<br />\nswelling, alleviating the pressure caused by the inflammation, and therefore ending the<br />\npain. The drug remains a<br />\nmystery, though, in that it acts<br />\ndifferently on different individuals. The effects of DMSO<br />\nvary greatly from person to person. The drug is even unpredictable when used by the same<br />\nperson more than once; it may<br />\nrelieve pain one week and fail<br />\nto do so the next.<br />\nIn the past, DMSO users<br />\nhave reported many side effects. The most common side<br /><br />\neffect is a strong garlic taste and<br />\nbody odor. Also DMSO may,<br />\ndepending on skin tolerance,<br />\ncause irritation to the area<br />\nwhere it is applied. It is believed that higher concentrations of<br />\nthe drug are more effective in<br />\nrelieving the pain, but they may<br />\ncause more irritation. The area<br />\nto which the DMSO is to be applied must be cleaned thoroughly before the drug iS used.<br />\nThis is because DMSO is a<br />\nstrong solvent and is able to<br />\npenetrate the skin rapidly.<br />\nThus, it is able to transport dirt<br />\nparticles present on the surface<br />\nof the skin through the skin and<br />\ninto the body.<br />\nIn addition, although no<br />\ncases of toxicity have been<br />\nreported, there is (as there is<br />\nwith any drug) a possibility of<br />\nan allergic reaction.<br />\nMost DMSO users have<br />\nreported only the strong garlic<br />\ntaste and odor as side effects.<br />\nMany have described the side<br />\neffects as minor compared to<br />\n'the benefits of the drug. Sports<br />\nfigures who have made extensive successful use of DMSO include Alberto Salazar and Jim<br />\nPalmer.<br /><br />\nThe patient will be instfucted<br />\nin the proper application of<br />\nDMSO. During the treatment<br />\nDMSO will be applied externally, three times a day, by the patient from his mid-calf area to<br />\nhis toes.'The treatment will last<br />\nfor about a week and the patient will be required to report<br />\nto the Sports Medicine Center<br />\nonce a day for seven days.<br />\nFor further information contact Mr. Lonny Connelly,<br />\nP.A., at the Union Memorial<br />\nSports Medicine Center by calling 235-7200.<br /><br />\nGettsburg back dribbles through .1:0 defense.<br /><br />\nBooters Finally Put It Together<br />\nBY BRUCE SOLITAR<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins soccer<br />\nteam finally played up to its<br />\npotential and recorded two<br />\nstrong wins in the past week.<br />\nTheir record now stands at<br />\n4-8-1.<br />\nLast Friday night at Homewood Field, the Jays put forth<br />\ntheir finest performance of the<br />\nseason.

They are<br />\na strong, physical team and<br />\nhold a victory over Western<br />\nMaryland, a team that defeated<br />\nHopkins. But the Jays appear<br />\nto now be a much better team<br />\nthan the one that lost to Western Maryland. If Hopkins can<br />\nbeat Mt.
