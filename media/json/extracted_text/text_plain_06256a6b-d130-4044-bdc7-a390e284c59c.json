MORTON '30<br />\n<br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br />\n<br />\nARMED NEUTRALITY<br />\nThe most portentious statement made relative to the spectacle of last Monday night, it seems to us, was President Goodnow's quotation of the old proverb \"Boys will be boys.\" All of<br />\nMagistrate Hopkins' ominous moralizing upon the fate of Richard<br />\nReese Whittemore, all of the praise that Mayor Howard of the<br />\nmetropolis of Annapolis received from one of the Baltimore dailies,<br />\nall the post mortems by freshmen, sophomores, or others were.<br />\nbeside the point.<br />\nIf the police force of Annapolis had been able to realize in<br />\nthe first place that then- job was to be ready in case of emergency<br />\nand not to attempt to interfere with extra-legal goings-on, it is<br />\nhighly probable that the \"riot\" that ensued would have been<br />\naverted. Baltimore police have, after several years, become accustomed to the annual fracas, and know that the best course of action<br />\nis armed neutrality. They stand ready to protect property, but<br />\nrealize that it would be the height of futility to try to conrol the<br />\nsituation beyond that.<br />\nThe Annapolis constabulary, unfortunately, seems to find that<br />\nmost of its duty leads to the incarceration of inebriated sailors and<br />\nberazored negroes, and acts accordingly. The billy, the most effective weapon to employ against these offenders, becomes the staff<br />\nof support of Annapolis, and as such keeps the peace by constant<br />\nuse. We suggest that Mayor Howard ask Commissioner Gaither<br />\nto allow him to study police methods in a civilized town.<br />\n<br />\nWHY NOT?<br />\nIt is indeed encouraging to discover occasionally that a faculty<br />\nmember considers undergraduates as human beings, and not as<br />\nexamples of how great a degree of degradation the human race<br />\ncan reach.<br />\n\\\\Te refer to Dr. Broadus Mitchell's talk at the junior class<br />\nbanoet early this week. Dr. Mitchell seemed to lament the fact<br />\nthat in the great majority of cases, relations between instructor and<br />\nstudent end at twenty minutes after the hour. He seems to be one<br />\nof the few members of the faculty who are interested in undergraduates and their problems, both scholastically and otherwise.<br />\nAnd what is still more remarkable was the fact that at the banquet<br />\nhe knew personally most of the men present.<br />\nThe original idea of this University, it has been often asserted,<br />\nwas not so much a curriculum of lecture courses as a place where<br />\nmen could obtain instruction in a given field by work and conversation with the professors in that field. Alas, undergraduates are<br />\nnot to be so blessed!<br />\nThe New Plan, of course, fosters just that thing. Eventually,<br />\nwhy not now?<br />\n<br />\nThere is a man at Hopkins with a very nervous hand,<br />\nWhich admits his limitations but which hopes you'll understand.<br />\nWhen his very rambling sentences lead to rather speechless straits<br />\nThen he mutters to a lucky pause, and from there, gesticulates.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins for bigger and better brawls! Hopkins under her<br />\ntrue colors. (Who picked 'em, anyway?) Every sock is a boost<br />\n\u2014to Hopkins notoriety! Here's to the blasting of Baltimore,<br />\nthe annihilation of Annapolis, and eternal bloodiness of class<br />\nfeuds!<br />\nEnthusiasm is rampant on the campus and elsewhere. Everybody who ever had any ideas at all was sure that boys would be<br />\nboys, and wasn't greatly surprised when they turned out to be<br />\nworse than that. The proof of the theory has brought about citywide recognition, and an interest on the part of the State capital.<br />\n\\Ve have been in the papers, the jail, and the hospital; we have<br />\ndiscovered that Annapolis, besides having a mayor, is a peaceful<br />\nand a moral city; we have destroyed the idea that Hopkins is exclusively an institution of higher education. And ain't we proud!<br />\nThe public, having found us vastly amusing instead of painfully serious, as college students should be, is feeling exceedingly<br />\nindulgent toward us. We are funny ;\u2014therefore we are a fine<br />\nlot of exuberant boys having an innocent good-time\u2014at the rate<br />\nof three thousand dollars, the papers say.<br />\n<br />\nJ. H.

Observing that it would do much toward abolishing all this delightful<br />\nsmashing of armories, morals, crockery, peace, windows and heads,<br />\nand that it would counteract this recent placement of Hopkins on<br />\nthe collegiate map, these fun-loving, bright-eyed old boys may<br />\nhave thought better of their dignified proposition.<br />\nThe whole incident might well be viewed as a moral revolt;<br />\nthat is wiser than to attribute it to sheer animal spirits. Why not<br />\ninterpret it thus: the undergraduates, having watched with dismay<br />\nthe decadence of all branches of sport except lacrosse, having<br />\nnoticed that the college comic is resting on the laurels of a number produced by outsiders, and that the number of students at<br />\nHopkins is increasing with alarming rapidity, asserted, in this<br />\nbanquet brawl, their disapproval of the present process of \"dignifying\" Hopkins.

MORTON '30<br /><br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br /><br />\nARMED NEUTRALITY<br />\nThe most portentious statement made relative to the spectacle of last Monday night, it seems to us, was President Goodnow's quotation of the old proverb \"Boys will be boys.\" All of<br />\nMagistrate Hopkins' ominous moralizing upon the fate of Richard<br />\nReese Whittemore, all of the praise that Mayor Howard of the<br />\nmetropolis of Annapolis received from one of the Baltimore dailies,<br />\nall the post mortems by freshmen, sophomores, or others were.<br />\nbeside the point.<br />\nIf the police force of Annapolis had been able to realize in<br />\nthe first place that then- job was to be ready in case of emergency<br />\nand not to attempt to interfere with extra-legal goings-on, it is<br />\nhighly probable that the \"riot\" that ensued would have been<br />\naverted. Baltimore police have, after several years, become accustomed to the annual fracas, and know that the best course of action<br />\nis armed neutrality. They stand ready to protect property, but<br />\nrealize that it would be the height of futility to try to conrol the<br />\nsituation beyond that.<br />\nThe Annapolis constabulary, unfortunately, seems to find that<br />\nmost of its duty leads to the incarceration of inebriated sailors and<br />\nberazored negroes, and acts accordingly. The billy, the most effective weapon to employ against these offenders, becomes the staff<br />\nof support of Annapolis, and as such keeps the peace by constant<br />\nuse. We suggest that Mayor Howard ask Commissioner Gaither<br />\nto allow him to study police methods in a civilized town.<br /><br />\nWHY NOT?<br />\nIt is indeed encouraging to discover occasionally that a faculty<br />\nmember considers undergraduates as human beings, and not as<br />\nexamples of how great a degree of degradation the human race<br />\ncan reach.<br />\n\\\\Te refer to Dr. Broadus Mitchell's talk at the junior class<br />\nbanoet early this week. Dr. Mitchell seemed to lament the fact<br />\nthat in the great majority of cases, relations between instructor and<br />\nstudent end at twenty minutes after the hour. He seems to be one<br />\nof the few members of the faculty who are interested in undergraduates and their problems, both scholastically and otherwise.<br />\nAnd what is still more remarkable was the fact that at the banquet<br />\nhe knew personally most of the men present.<br />\nThe original idea of this University, it has been often asserted,<br />\nwas not so much a curriculum of lecture courses as a place where<br />\nmen could obtain instruction in a given field by work and conversation with the professors in that field. Alas, undergraduates are<br />\nnot to be so blessed!<br />\nThe New Plan, of course, fosters just that thing. Eventually,<br />\nwhy not now?<br /><br />\nThere is a man at Hopkins with a very nervous hand,<br />\nWhich admits his limitations but which hopes you'll understand.<br />\nWhen his very rambling sentences lead to rather speechless straits<br />\nThen he mutters to a lucky pause, and from there, gesticulates.<br /><br />\nHopkins for bigger and better brawls! Hopkins under her<br />\ntrue colors. (Who picked 'em, anyway?) Every sock is a boost<br />\n\u2014to Hopkins notoriety! Here's to the blasting of Baltimore,<br />\nthe annihilation of Annapolis, and eternal bloodiness of class<br />\nfeuds!<br />\nEnthusiasm is rampant on the campus and elsewhere. Everybody who ever had any ideas at all was sure that boys would be<br />\nboys, and wasn't greatly surprised when they turned out to be<br />\nworse than that. The proof of the theory has brought about citywide recognition, and an interest on the part of the State capital.<br />\n\\Ve have been in the papers, the jail, and the hospital; we have<br />\ndiscovered that Annapolis, besides having a mayor, is a peaceful<br />\nand a moral city; we have destroyed the idea that Hopkins is exclusively an institution of higher education. And ain't we proud!<br />\nThe public, having found us vastly amusing instead of painfully serious, as college students should be, is feeling exceedingly<br />\nindulgent toward us. We are funny ;\u2014therefore we are a fine<br />\nlot of exuberant boys having an innocent good-time\u2014at the rate<br />\nof three thousand dollars, the papers say.<br /><br />\nJ. H.

Why not<br />\ninterpret it thus: the undergraduates, having watched with dismay<br />\nthe decadence of all branches of sport except lacrosse, having<br />\nnoticed that the college comic is resting on the laurels of a number produced by outsiders, and that the number of students at<br />\nHopkins is increasing with alarming rapidity, asserted, in this<br />\nbanquet brawl, their disapproval of the present process of \"dignifying\" Hopkins.
