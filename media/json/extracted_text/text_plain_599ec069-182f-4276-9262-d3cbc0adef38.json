In our own city there are at present, according to the<br />\nmost reliable calculations, at least ten thousand persons suffering from consumption, with an annual death rate averaging over one thousand. Quotations<br />\nsuch as these, however, fail to make much of an impression upon the public,<br />\nbecause the average layman regards tuberculosis as a disease with which some<br />\nfamilies are unfortunate enough to be tainted; he thinks that its development is<br />\nsimply a family predisposition, that its prevention is impossible and that a<br />\nfatal result is always inevitable.<br />\nPresent facts, however, teach us that consumption is a dangerous, contagious or communicable disease, and that it is also a very curable disease<br />\nwhen properly treated in its incipient stage. We know now that consumption<br />\nis not of an hereditary nature, passed down from generation to generation. but<br />\nthat it is a directly communicable disease, being transmitted from one individual<br />\nto another, through the widespread dissemination of the germs known as tubercle bacilli. An individual suffering from consumption is estimated to expectorate as many as seven billions of bacilli in twenty-four hours. As long as<br />\nthe expectorations remain in the liquid state, there is little danger from them,<br />\nBut matter expectorated on the floor, in the street, or in a handkerchief, usually<br />\ndries very rapidly, and, becoming pulverized, finds its way into the respiratory<br />\ntract of any one who chances to inhale the air in which is floating this dust<br />\nfrom expectorations. Doubtless, each one of us every day of our lives inhale<br />\ntubercle bacilli in countless numbers; but when we are in good health, our<br />\nnasal muceous secretion possesses bactericidal qualities sufficient to destroy the<br />\nbacilli and prevent them from doing any harm. But if we allow ourselves to<br />\nbecome run down, with our powers of resistance lowered, the nasal secretion<br />\nloses its bactericidal powers and the inhalation of particles of dried and pulver-<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nized tuberculous expectorations would result in a great risk of contracting pulmonary tuberculosis. It would seem, therefore, that any measures adopted by<br />\nthe Board of Public Health towards the proper care of and control of<br />\nthe poor, careless, and ignorant consumptive would be of inculcable benefit<br />\nto the public health and general hygiene of the community. I say careless and<br />\nignorant consumptives, because undoubtedly the chief sources of infection and<br />\nspread of the disease is due to the thousands of poor who are either too ill, too<br />\nignorant, or too indifferent to properly dispose of their sputum and thus render<br />\nthemselves no longer sources of contagion. Every municipality has seen fit to<br />\nprovide suitable accommodations for the unfortunate sick poor suffering from<br />\nvarious disorders. City hospitals afford them a fair opportunity for recovery,<br />\nor if the chance for this has passed, a decent place in which to die, with the one<br />\nexception of consumptives.<br />\nEvery general municipal hospital in the<br />\ncountry at present declines to admit consumptives to their wards, with<br />\nthe result that the multitude of unfortunates suffering from phthisis are<br />\neither left alone in their own homes to die from want and neglect,<br />\npitiable objects for both private and public charity, or else sent to further<br />\ncongest the already overcrowded almshouse. It is an unfair and unjust<br />\ndistinction of the equally worthy poor patients to afford one all the benefits of<br />\nour magnificent hospitals because he is fortunate enough to have any other disease than consumption, and to relegate the other to the pauper's home because<br />\nhe is unfortunate enough to have consumption. It is the purpose of every<br />\nmunicipal government to make generous provisions for whatever may be conducive to the well-being, protection and health of its people. Hence the erection of hospitals, asylums, and almshouse for the care and detention of sick,<br />\npoor, inebriates, and lunatics.<br />\nIn spite of these estimable institutions, does it not seem remarkable that<br />\nup to the present time, with few exceptions, no effort has been made on the<br />\npart of the Board of Health to care for or aid that class of sufferers whose affliction is unquestionably of the greatest possible menace to the health of the community, inasmuch as it is the cause of about one-tenth of the total annual mortality?<br />\nPersons interested in this subject have long ago agreed that proper care and<br />\nisolation of the poor consumptive is a most pressing and urgent need. The<br />\nerection of especial hospitals for the isolation of advanced cases, and the establishing of country homes for the treatment of those in the early stages of the<br />\ndisease, seem to be the only remedy. Every large city should have one or more<br />\nhospitals where hopeless cases could be taken, with the idea, not only of making<br />\ntheir last days on earth as peaceful as possible, but also of rendering them no<br />\nlonger sources of danger to their family and friends and a drawback to the<br />\nwage-earning capacity of the, remaining members of their families.<br />\nOf no less importance would be the building of several country sanatorio,<br />\neither in the suburbs, or else in some region of moderate altitude, where the<br />\nincipient cases could be sent and given a chance to recover their lost health.<br />\nAt present, physicians working in the free dispensaries, where the great major-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nity of pauper consumptives seek treatment, are absolutely powerless to do anything for them with the hope of affording permanent relief. We may prescribe<br />\nand often alleviate their most prominent symptoms; we may instruct them how<br />\nto properly dispose of their sputum and thus make themselves lesi dangerous<br />\nto their families. But we cannot give them the treatment they need, and we<br />\nare thus forced to see useful lives sacrificed which might be saved had we the<br />\nproper means at our disposal. To my mind, the multiple creation of institutions devoted especially to the consumptive will solve more than anything else,<br />\nthe difficult problem of how to reduce the mortality from tuberculosis and prevent its spread in general.<br />\nPrivate philanthropy has made a good beginning in Baltimore, but can<br />\naccomplish relatively little without further financial assistance, either from individual donation or from the city and state treasuries. The little hospital at<br />\nTowson is doing on a small scale what might be done on a very much larger<br />\none if more funds were forthcoming. The distressingly large waiting-list in<br />\nthe hands of the resident physician is the best evidence that larger institutions<br />\nof this character are sorely needed in Baltimore. During the past year, of fortynine cases admitted in all stages of the disease, fourteen were discharged with<br />\ntheir disease arrested and were able to resume work. These figures speak very<br />\nwell for what may be done in the very suburbs of our city in a small institution<br />\ncramped for money and struggling to care for as many unfortunates as possible.<br />\nMany sanatorio claim as many as 70 per cent. of cures when patients are admitted to treatment in the incipient stages; and I have reason to believe that these<br />\nfigures are correct; for pulmonary tuberculosis in the earlier stages is indeed one<br />\nof the most curable of diseases. The charitably disposed contribute considerable amounts yearly in one form or another for the destitute sick in their<br />\nmidst. The destitute consumptive, especially the advanced case, is the most<br />\nfrequent applicant for such aid as his is the most common disease. Is it good<br />\njudgment? is it economical, to expend the money in keeping him at his home, a<br />\nmenace to all around him, send him to the poorhouse already overcrowded and<br />\nunfitted for the hopeful treatment of such cases, or expend the same amount,<br />\npossibly less, in placing him in a properly equipped consumptive hospital?<br />\nSurely, here is a great chance for our philanthropists to aid their poor fellow<br />\ncitizens by the speedy erection of consumptive hospitals or by contributing to<br />\nthose already in operation- They will then not only help safely these unfortunates suffering from tuberculosis, but will render to the community at large<br />\nan incalculable service by thus inaugurating means for the prevention of the<br />\ndisease to which at present old and young, rich and poor, are falling victims<br />\nby thousands every year.<br />\n<br />\nWhy is it that a girl must have<br />\nA dried-up, dreary chaperon?<br />\nMuch better times she would enjoy<br />\nIn going with a chap alone.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nSOME EXPERT OPINION OF THE '02 LACROSSE TEAM AND<br />\nMAY 10th.<br />\nCOACH :\u2014Hopkins never had a better team as a team. It was the best<br />\ngame, played by the best all-round team, I have ever seen. The work was<br />\nbrilliantly even; it took great team work to win, and that meant every man had<br />\nto be a star. If any one stood out above the rest, it was Abercrombie. His<br />\nvery presence gave the men confidence; and when he went into a \"mix-up,\"<br />\nHopkins was sure to get the ball. It will be many a year, I am afraid, before<br />\nHopkins can hope to duplicate the team of 1902.<br />\nWM. HARVEY MADDREN.<br />\nCAPTAIN OP THE '98 vARSITY:\u2014The game with Swarthmore was certainly<br />\na rare treat for the spectators, and the team deserve much praise for the great<br />\ngame they played, one and all.<br />\nIt seemed to me that the catching of the attack men when closely covered<br />\nwas a noticeable feature, and all who have followed lacrosse at Johns Hopkins<br />\nmust have felt proud to see our team out-last the always well-trained Swarthmore men. The two points that seem to bear criticism are the fact that the<br />\nattack did not draw the defense men out when closely covered, and that there<br />\nwas too much throwing at random by some of the players in mid field positions.<br />\nI think the team is the most evenly balanced we have ever had, and one of<br />\nwhich every Johns Hopkins man should feel truly proud.<br />\nG. CANny ROBINSON, '99.<br />\n<br />\nCAPTAIN OF THE '00 VARSITY:\u2014There was the fastest game of lacrosse at<br />\nAmerican League Park with Swarthmore on Saturday that we have seen for at<br />\nleast five years of my experience. It was game from beginning to finish.<br />\nSwarthmore was in the very best shape for team play, but Hopkins proved a<br />\nlittle better, The play through, was hard and quick.<br />\nIn fact, Baltimore has never enjoyed a keener contest.<br />\nRONALD T. ABERCROMBIE.<br />\n'00 ALUMNUS ATHLETIC DELEGATE:\u2014Please extend to our lacrosse team<br />\nand to all friends of athletics at Hopkins my hest congratulations on the magnificent work of the season. I have followed the work of the lacrosse Men as<br />\nclosely as I could, at this long range, and it seems to me that the team must be<br />\nthe best in the history of Hopkins lacrosse.<br />\nI was greatly disappointed at the loss of the Relay, but that disappointment is now forgotten.<br />\nIf Hopkins can win such victories without her new campus or athletic<br />\nfield, what will she not be able to do at Homewood? Let the good work go on!<br />\nThe \"Has-beens\" are watching you.<br />\nALBERT M. REESE,<br />\nAlumnus Delegate to Athletic Board, 1900.<br />\nA CANADIAN AUTHORITY:\u2014It was the best amateur game I ever saw.<br />\nNot even in a professional game have I seen cleaner passing. Then, too, there<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nwas no exhibition of selfishness. There is usually a desire on the part of one<br />\nor two star players to keep the ball most of the time, but the Hopkins team was<br />\nnoticeably free from such plays. I do not mean to say that the university boys<br />\ncould defeat the professional Canadian teams. The men on the professional<br />\nteams are much heavier, and all their time is devoted to lacrosse. But there is<br />\nthe same relation between the fastest college base ball and professional ball, as<br />\nbetween the Hopkins lacrosse team and the professional teams of Canada. The<br />\ngoal shooting did not seem to be as clean as it might have been; there was a<br />\ntendency to shoot too low. Instead of bringing the ball down the side of the<br />\nfield and then have one man lob it into the goal, as is the Canadian custom, the<br />\nHopkins men played more in the center of the field. Vet there can be no doubt<br />\nbut that the Hopkins team is the best in its class. I don't think I ever saw a<br />\ncleaner, better game.<br />\nREV. DONALD G.

The third spring team is the base ball. Its attitude may<br />\nbest be seen by a reference .to Captain Campbell's letter, which appears on<br />\nanother page. Lest it should seem to be a little out of touch with its companion teams, the reader should remember the \"condition of probation,\" as the<br />\n'02 Hullabaloo puts it, in which the team finds itself.

The showing made by the squad, however,<br />\nwas not so unfavorable as this would seem to indicate, because new men only<br />\nwere taken on the trifi, and also because in the game with Johns Hopkins University three players were unable to play on account of injuries. The score in<br />\nthis game was 11 to 1. * * On the basis of the work done during the trip, a<br />\nUniversity team will be picked this week, and on Saturday will play the first<br />\nregular game of the season with the College of the City of New York. * * \"<br />\nThe italics in this quotation are our own.

The aim of the editors has been t<br />\nas much representative of the whole college as possible\u2014a book of<br />\nit<br />\nmake<br />\nreference for every phase of Hopkins life. In this connection, they have given<br />\na list of Hopkins songs much fuller than in preceding editions, which constitute<br />\na welcome feature.<br />\nThe cover is a pleasing combination of University and class colors; the<br />\nbody black and blue, the lettering in white, making the blue and white of '02.<br />\nThe University seal in gold is also shown. The leading article, by President<br />\nRemsen, is entitled \"Reminiscences of Dr. Rowland,\" and contains some<br />\namusing tales of their intimacy on fishing expeditions and the like. Ex-President Gilman also contributes an article on research at the University.<br />\nThese and the other stock features of the book, are, of course, less interesting to the undergrad than the \"stunts.\" Among these will be noticed the<br />\nfurther development of the Hopkins Girl. She is shown as a Class Girl, an<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nAthletic Girl\u2014in seven roles altogether, and attractive in all. The series of<br />\n\"Trophy Room Talks\" will be enjoyed by all who fancy they recognize the<br />\n\"kicker,\" the \"poet,\" and the \"chronic jollier.\" The editors consider, indeed,<br />\nthat the \"roasts\" and \"grinds\" have been distributed so universally and impartially that no one can have cause of complaint.<br />\nThere are minor defects in the book, such as the use of a quotation \"the<br />\nmildest-mannered man,\" cribbed from the '01 book, or slips in proofreading<br />\n(the Hopkins-Gettysburg game is given: \"J. H. U., 0; Gettysburg, 2.\") But it<br />\nis a production worthy of the University, and an improvement over its<br />\npredecessors, as every class book should be.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS- LETTER :<br />\nThe base ball season of 1902 has closed. Doubters and scoffers had said<br />\nthat it was impossible to maintain a team. It was found, however, to be comparatively easy. The chief obstacle that was encountered was the prevalence<br />\nof wet weather for a time around Easter. The promoters and members of the<br />\nteam are delighted with their success. The organization was complete, the<br />\ntraining and practice iegular, obligations were met, engagements fulfilled,<br />\nand<br />\na creditable showing made. The team played three games against competit<br />\nors<br />\nthat were quite out of its class, and thereby subjected itself to defeats in a manner that is usually avoided by Hopkins teams. But only satisfaction can be expressed at the re establishment of intercourse between Hopkins and<br />\nthe Naval<br />\nAcademy. This is an accomplishment of the base ball team. Because<br />\nof the<br />\nfaithfulness and devotion of the men, and the heroic efforts that they<br />\nhad made,<br />\nit was proposed before the Athletic Board to give the team recognition,<br />\nthe claim<br />\nbeing made (which is unquestionably true) that they had done<br />\nquite as much<br />\nhard work for Hopkins as a foot ball team does. The Board, however<br />\n, was<br />\ndisinclined to take any favorable action. This, many think, was a<br />\nmistake.<br />\nThe base ball team had certainly earned recognition. And further,<br />\nthe action,<br />\nor want of action, would indicate that Hopkins does not encourage her sons<br />\nto<br />\nexert themselves in her behalf. But this surely cannot be true;<br />\nthe injustice<br />\nwill soon be corrected.<br />\nR. J. G. McKnight has been named by the men as captain for next<br />\nyear,<br />\nand J. N. Numsen as manager. At least five, and probably seven,<br />\nof this years'<br />\nplayers will return. These men will form a splendid nucleus. Quite<br />\na little<br />\ninterest was manifested in the undertaking this year, and by next spring<br />\nthe<br />\nmovement will have gained more momentum and more intrinsic attractio<br />\nn.<br />\nThose who uphold the \"cause\" are alive to their duties and their opportun<br />\nities.<br />\nThey are ready patiently to contend against obstacles, prejudices,<br />\nindifference,<br />\nopen and secret antagonism. It appears that Hopkins will no longer<br />\nhave to<br />\nbear the reproach of not being able to support a base ball team.<br />\nTo all those who during these strenuous times have given their good<br />\nwill,<br />\nor friendly aid, I express a sincere gratitude.<br />\nJOHN G.

The complete victory over the Maryland Athletic Club, whose members, by the way, were predicting the downfall<br />\nof Hopkins, may best be shown by the following figures:<br />\nJohns Hopkins, 60 points; Maryland Athletic Club, 36 points; Central Y.<br />\nM. C. A., 8 points; St. Leo's Gymnasium, 6 points; Baltimore Athletic Club,<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nU points.<br />\nThe foregoing statistics plainly show what Hopkins accomplished in open<br />\nscratch games against the fastest athletes in Maryland. Our men scored more<br />\npoints than all the other competitors combined, and won the surprisingly large<br />\nnumber of twenty-four places in the ten events on the program. In two events,<br />\nthe 220 yard dash and the running high jump, Hopkins won all four places,<br />\nwhile three wearers of Black and Blue made points in several others.<br />\nThe quarter mile run, in which \"Joe\" England clipped 2 1-5 seconds off<br />\nthe State record, was undoubtedly the prettiest race of the day. Our captain<br />\ntook the lead at a furious pace from the start, and was never headed. The speed<br />\nwith which the men rounded the curve before reaching the home stretch caused<br />\nmany of the spectators to predict a slow finish, but \"Joe\" had calculated his<br />\npowers of endurance to a nicety, and held the pace until he broke the string.<br />\n\"Billy\" Weedon stepped up with a big surprise for even his fellow athletes.<br />\n\"Bill\" has always been calculated to win medals for \"Tom Hopkins,\" but his<br />\n<br />\n\f12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ngraduate work made it impossible for him to train to any extent for the games,<br />\nand when he catne in for two gold medals and a bronze one, probably nobody<br />\nwas more surprised than \"Billy\" himself.

Swarthmore was trained to the hour, and for the Hopkins<br />\nmen \"Father Bill's\" various remedies, and '`Mother Bill\" Schmeisser's black<br />\npills certainly did the work.<br />\n. As was predicted, there was no let-up from start to finish, and had Hopkins<br />\nnot been prepared to more than hold the terrific pace which Swarthmore set, the<br />\ntale might have been different. The result was that Hopkins slightly outdid<br />\nthe visitors, even in that heart-breaking first half, and in the second the<br />\nQuakers were downed decisively. At one time particularly, the 'Varsity took<br />\nthings on the jump and scored four goals in 5 minutes and 37 seconds. Such<br />\nwork against a team like Swarthmore has certainly never been equaled in the<br />\nhistory of Hopkins lacrosse.<br />\nIn speaking of the game upon the return of the team to the University,<br />\n\"Billy' Maddren said: \"By golly, boys, I'm glad I wasn't in that game, and<br />\ndo you know why? Just this, the pace was too fast. I could never have held<br />\nit.\"<br />\nApparently there was not a weak spot on the team, and every man con<br />\ntributed a generous share toward carrying off the honors.<br />\nThe first half started with a grand rush, and for 25 minutes the rooters and<br />\nor<br />\nenthusiastic friends were wholly unable to tell whether nervous prostration<br />\nbroke<br />\n'Bernie\"<br />\nlittle<br />\nlast,<br />\nAt<br />\ndeath.<br />\ntheir<br />\nof<br />\nexcessive joy would be the cause<br />\nthe terrible suspense by driving the first goal into the net. A few minutes<br />\nlater Putts repeated the operation, and, before the whistle blew, Beans scored<br />\none for the visitors, making the standing two goals to one.<br />\nThe second half found Hopkins thoroughly aggressive and somewhat faster<br />\nthan Swarthmore. The same rush marked the start, and in less than three<br />\nin genminutes Putts tipped the third goal into the net. Then things woke up<br />\nthan<br />\nless<br />\nin<br />\ngoals<br />\nfour<br />\nof<br />\nn<br />\nphenomeno<br />\nthe<br />\neral.

Swarthmore<br />\ncovered<br />\nBlanck<br />\nand<br />\nTough<br />\neffectively.<br />\nwork of our defense held them back<br />\nhack like race-horses, and both Schmeissers and Henry Straus did such terrific<br />\nbody checking that Swarthmore's home men literally lost their nerve. Briscoe<br />\nplayed a star game at goal, and handled with wonderful skill all kinds of fancy<br />\nshots which happened to escape the others. On the attack \"Aber\" was much<br />\nin evidence, and got off his usual clever \"stunts\" with little \"Bernie.\" Putts,<br />\nB.

M. C. 1.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE game of May 7th against Georgetown. in which Hopkins lost by the<br />\noverwhelming score of 24 to 1, served as an excellent preparation for the<br />\ncontest of the following Saturday at Westminster. In that game the playing of the Black and Blue reached the proper standard,\u2014a consummation that<br />\nshould have been effected earlier and was hindered only by unavoidable obstacles. Western Maryland was fortunate in scoring. With Whipple pitching like<br />\nclock-work and Hopkins playing an errorless game, the result seemed never<br />\nin doubt.<br />\nThe first runs came in the third inning. McKnight reached first on a fumble by Henry. The next three men drew passes, and McKnight was forced in.<br />\nWright drove a hard one through Simpson and two more runs scored. In the<br />\nfifth inning with Moore and McKnight on bases, Campbell hit a safe one to left<br />\nwhich sent them both home. One more came in the seventh. Whipple singled<br />\nand advanced to second on Crozier's neat sacrifice. From there he scored on<br />\nMoore's beautiful two-bagger to center field.<br />\nWestern Maryland was saved from a shut-out in the eighth inning. Roberts was served up the wrong sort of a curve, and he promptly dropped the ball<br />\nover in the left field garden-patch. McKnight quickly leaped the fence, recovered the ball, and made an astonishing throw all the way into Moore's hand at<br />\nshort stop. Never before had such a feat been accomplished, and Roberts was<br />\nheld on third. From there he ran in on Brown's slow one to short. Brown died<br />\ntrying to steal second, and with him Maryland's hopes.<br />\nThe features of the game for Hopkins were McKnight's throw in the eighth,<br />\nand Moore's remarkable play at short stop. He accepted eleven chances without an error. Whipple pitched in his customary steady way and kept the hits<br />\nharmlessly scattered. For Western Maryland, Brown made the star play in the<br />\nninth inning when he scooped up with one hand a fast grounder past second<br />\nbase, and robbed Marine of a hit. Aydelotte pitched well, except for his wildness in one inning. Hopkins hits, however, came when they were needed, and<br />\nthereby clinched the game.<br />\nHOPKIN8.\u2014Moore, Ft.

Manager Slemons was instructed to make enquiries as<br />\nto whether we shall be able to secure the American League grounds. On<br />\naccount of base ball, these cannot be gotten before June 11. If the Canadians<br />\ncan he persuaded to play the Crescents about June 9, and come to Baltimore<br />\nseveral days later, the game is not only possible but very probable.<br />\nShould we win or lose, such a contest would give a wonderful stimulus to<br />\nthe popularity of the sport among Baltimoreans Our team is acknowledged as<br />\nbeing the strongest ever turned out by Hopkins, and there is a bare possibility<br />\nthat we might. beat the Canadians at their own game.

In our own city there are at present, according to the<br />\nmost reliable calculations, at least ten thousand persons suffering from consumption, with an annual death rate averaging over one thousand. Quotations<br />\nsuch as these, however, fail to make much of an impression upon the public,<br />\nbecause the average layman regards tuberculosis as a disease with which some<br />\nfamilies are unfortunate enough to be tainted; he thinks that its development is<br />\nsimply a family predisposition, that its prevention is impossible and that a<br />\nfatal result is always inevitable.<br />\nPresent facts, however, teach us that consumption is a dangerous, contagious or communicable disease, and that it is also a very curable disease<br />\nwhen properly treated in its incipient stage. We know now that consumption<br />\nis not of an hereditary nature, passed down from generation to generation. but<br />\nthat it is a directly communicable disease, being transmitted from one individual<br />\nto another, through the widespread dissemination of the germs known as tubercle bacilli. An individual suffering from consumption is estimated to expectorate as many as seven billions of bacilli in twenty-four hours. As long as<br />\nthe expectorations remain in the liquid state, there is little danger from them,<br />\nBut matter expectorated on the floor, in the street, or in a handkerchief, usually<br />\ndries very rapidly, and, becoming pulverized, finds its way into the respiratory<br />\ntract of any one who chances to inhale the air in which is floating this dust<br />\nfrom expectorations. Doubtless, each one of us every day of our lives inhale<br />\ntubercle bacilli in countless numbers; but when we are in good health, our<br />\nnasal muceous secretion possesses bactericidal qualities sufficient to destroy the<br />\nbacilli and prevent them from doing any harm. But if we allow ourselves to<br />\nbecome run down, with our powers of resistance lowered, the nasal secretion<br />\nloses its bactericidal powers and the inhalation of particles of dried and pulver-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nized tuberculous expectorations would result in a great risk of contracting pulmonary tuberculosis. It would seem, therefore, that any measures adopted by<br />\nthe Board of Public Health towards the proper care of and control of<br />\nthe poor, careless, and ignorant consumptive would be of inculcable benefit<br />\nto the public health and general hygiene of the community. I say careless and<br />\nignorant consumptives, because undoubtedly the chief sources of infection and<br />\nspread of the disease is due to the thousands of poor who are either too ill, too<br />\nignorant, or too indifferent to properly dispose of their sputum and thus render<br />\nthemselves no longer sources of contagion. Every municipality has seen fit to<br />\nprovide suitable accommodations for the unfortunate sick poor suffering from<br />\nvarious disorders. City hospitals afford them a fair opportunity for recovery,<br />\nor if the chance for this has passed, a decent place in which to die, with the one<br />\nexception of consumptives.<br />\nEvery general municipal hospital in the<br />\ncountry at present declines to admit consumptives to their wards, with<br />\nthe result that the multitude of unfortunates suffering from phthisis are<br />\neither left alone in their own homes to die from want and neglect,<br />\npitiable objects for both private and public charity, or else sent to further<br />\ncongest the already overcrowded almshouse. It is an unfair and unjust<br />\ndistinction of the equally worthy poor patients to afford one all the benefits of<br />\nour magnificent hospitals because he is fortunate enough to have any other disease than consumption, and to relegate the other to the pauper's home because<br />\nhe is unfortunate enough to have consumption. It is the purpose of every<br />\nmunicipal government to make generous provisions for whatever may be conducive to the well-being, protection and health of its people. Hence the erection of hospitals, asylums, and almshouse for the care and detention of sick,<br />\npoor, inebriates, and lunatics.<br />\nIn spite of these estimable institutions, does it not seem remarkable that<br />\nup to the present time, with few exceptions, no effort has been made on the<br />\npart of the Board of Health to care for or aid that class of sufferers whose affliction is unquestionably of the greatest possible menace to the health of the community, inasmuch as it is the cause of about one-tenth of the total annual mortality?<br />\nPersons interested in this subject have long ago agreed that proper care and<br />\nisolation of the poor consumptive is a most pressing and urgent need. The<br />\nerection of especial hospitals for the isolation of advanced cases, and the establishing of country homes for the treatment of those in the early stages of the<br />\ndisease, seem to be the only remedy. Every large city should have one or more<br />\nhospitals where hopeless cases could be taken, with the idea, not only of making<br />\ntheir last days on earth as peaceful as possible, but also of rendering them no<br />\nlonger sources of danger to their family and friends and a drawback to the<br />\nwage-earning capacity of the, remaining members of their families.<br />\nOf no less importance would be the building of several country sanatorio,<br />\neither in the suburbs, or else in some region of moderate altitude, where the<br />\nincipient cases could be sent and given a chance to recover their lost health.<br />\nAt present, physicians working in the free dispensaries, where the great major-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nity of pauper consumptives seek treatment, are absolutely powerless to do anything for them with the hope of affording permanent relief. We may prescribe<br />\nand often alleviate their most prominent symptoms; we may instruct them how<br />\nto properly dispose of their sputum and thus make themselves lesi dangerous<br />\nto their families. But we cannot give them the treatment they need, and we<br />\nare thus forced to see useful lives sacrificed which might be saved had we the<br />\nproper means at our disposal. To my mind, the multiple creation of institutions devoted especially to the consumptive will solve more than anything else,<br />\nthe difficult problem of how to reduce the mortality from tuberculosis and prevent its spread in general.<br />\nPrivate philanthropy has made a good beginning in Baltimore, but can<br />\naccomplish relatively little without further financial assistance, either from individual donation or from the city and state treasuries. The little hospital at<br />\nTowson is doing on a small scale what might be done on a very much larger<br />\none if more funds were forthcoming. The distressingly large waiting-list in<br />\nthe hands of the resident physician is the best evidence that larger institutions<br />\nof this character are sorely needed in Baltimore. During the past year, of fortynine cases admitted in all stages of the disease, fourteen were discharged with<br />\ntheir disease arrested and were able to resume work. These figures speak very<br />\nwell for what may be done in the very suburbs of our city in a small institution<br />\ncramped for money and struggling to care for as many unfortunates as possible.<br />\nMany sanatorio claim as many as 70 per cent. of cures when patients are admitted to treatment in the incipient stages; and I have reason to believe that these<br />\nfigures are correct; for pulmonary tuberculosis in the earlier stages is indeed one<br />\nof the most curable of diseases. The charitably disposed contribute considerable amounts yearly in one form or another for the destitute sick in their<br />\nmidst. The destitute consumptive, especially the advanced case, is the most<br />\nfrequent applicant for such aid as his is the most common disease. Is it good<br />\njudgment? is it economical, to expend the money in keeping him at his home, a<br />\nmenace to all around him, send him to the poorhouse already overcrowded and<br />\nunfitted for the hopeful treatment of such cases, or expend the same amount,<br />\npossibly less, in placing him in a properly equipped consumptive hospital?<br />\nSurely, here is a great chance for our philanthropists to aid their poor fellow<br />\ncitizens by the speedy erection of consumptive hospitals or by contributing to<br />\nthose already in operation- They will then not only help safely these unfortunates suffering from tuberculosis, but will render to the community at large<br />\nan incalculable service by thus inaugurating means for the prevention of the<br />\ndisease to which at present old and young, rich and poor, are falling victims<br />\nby thousands every year.<br /><br />\nWhy is it that a girl must have<br />\nA dried-up, dreary chaperon?<br />\nMuch better times she would enjoy<br />\nIn going with a chap alone.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nSOME EXPERT OPINION OF THE '02 LACROSSE TEAM AND<br />\nMAY 10th.<br />\nCOACH :\u2014Hopkins never had a better team as a team. It was the best<br />\ngame, played by the best all-round team, I have ever seen. The work was<br />\nbrilliantly even; it took great team work to win, and that meant every man had<br />\nto be a star. If any one stood out above the rest, it was Abercrombie. His<br />\nvery presence gave the men confidence; and when he went into a \"mix-up,\"<br />\nHopkins was sure to get the ball. It will be many a year, I am afraid, before<br />\nHopkins can hope to duplicate the team of 1902.<br />\nWM. HARVEY MADDREN.<br />\nCAPTAIN OP THE '98 vARSITY:\u2014The game with Swarthmore was certainly<br />\na rare treat for the spectators, and the team deserve much praise for the great<br />\ngame they played, one and all.<br />\nIt seemed to me that the catching of the attack men when closely covered<br />\nwas a noticeable feature, and all who have followed lacrosse at Johns Hopkins<br />\nmust have felt proud to see our team out-last the always well-trained Swarthmore men. The two points that seem to bear criticism are the fact that the<br />\nattack did not draw the defense men out when closely covered, and that there<br />\nwas too much throwing at random by some of the players in mid field positions.<br />\nI think the team is the most evenly balanced we have ever had, and one of<br />\nwhich every Johns Hopkins man should feel truly proud.<br />\nG. CANny ROBINSON, '99.<br /><br />\nCAPTAIN OF THE '00 VARSITY:\u2014There was the fastest game of lacrosse at<br />\nAmerican League Park with Swarthmore on Saturday that we have seen for at<br />\nleast five years of my experience. It was game from beginning to finish.<br />\nSwarthmore was in the very best shape for team play, but Hopkins proved a<br />\nlittle better, The play through, was hard and quick.<br />\nIn fact, Baltimore has never enjoyed a keener contest.<br />\nRONALD T. ABERCROMBIE.<br />\n'00 ALUMNUS ATHLETIC DELEGATE:\u2014Please extend to our lacrosse team<br />\nand to all friends of athletics at Hopkins my hest congratulations on the magnificent work of the season. I have followed the work of the lacrosse Men as<br />\nclosely as I could, at this long range, and it seems to me that the team must be<br />\nthe best in the history of Hopkins lacrosse.<br />\nI was greatly disappointed at the loss of the Relay, but that disappointment is now forgotten.<br />\nIf Hopkins can win such victories without her new campus or athletic<br />\nfield, what will she not be able to do at Homewood? Let the good work go on!<br />\nThe \"Has-beens\" are watching you.<br />\nALBERT M. REESE,<br />\nAlumnus Delegate to Athletic Board, 1900.<br />\nA CANADIAN AUTHORITY:\u2014It was the best amateur game I ever saw.<br />\nNot even in a professional game have I seen cleaner passing. Then, too, there<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nwas no exhibition of selfishness. There is usually a desire on the part of one<br />\nor two star players to keep the ball most of the time, but the Hopkins team was<br />\nnoticeably free from such plays. I do not mean to say that the university boys<br />\ncould defeat the professional Canadian teams. The men on the professional<br />\nteams are much heavier, and all their time is devoted to lacrosse. But there is<br />\nthe same relation between the fastest college base ball and professional ball, as<br />\nbetween the Hopkins lacrosse team and the professional teams of Canada. The<br />\ngoal shooting did not seem to be as clean as it might have been; there was a<br />\ntendency to shoot too low. Instead of bringing the ball down the side of the<br />\nfield and then have one man lob it into the goal, as is the Canadian custom, the<br />\nHopkins men played more in the center of the field. Vet there can be no doubt<br />\nbut that the Hopkins team is the best in its class. I don't think I ever saw a<br />\ncleaner, better game.<br />\nREV. DONALD G.

The third spring team is the base ball. Its attitude may<br />\nbest be seen by a reference .to Captain Campbell's letter, which appears on<br />\nanother page. Lest it should seem to be a little out of touch with its companion teams, the reader should remember the \"condition of probation,\" as the<br />\n'02 Hullabaloo puts it, in which the team finds itself.

And here it is, from the Harvard Crimson:<br />\n\"Of the four games played by the lacrosse team during its southern trip,<br />\nthree were lost and one was tied. The showing made by the squad, however,<br />\nwas not so unfavorable as this would seem to indicate, because new men only<br />\nwere taken on the trifi, and also because in the game with Johns Hopkins University three players were unable to play on account of injuries. The score in<br />\nthis game was 11 to 1. * * On the basis of the work done during the trip, a<br />\nUniversity team will be picked this week, and on Saturday will play the first<br />\nregular game of the season with the College of the City of New York. * * \"<br />\nThe italics in this quotation are our own. It was with a sense of temerity<br />\nthat we set about correcting the statements of a college paper so far outdistancing us in age and size; but the occasion is tempting, and the evidence at hand.<br />\nIn last year's game with Harvard, we find, among the names of the twelve<br />\ncrimson wearers, the following six: Chaffee, Stevenson, Hoquet, Alvord,<br />\nMichell, Goddard. In this year's game with Harvard, we find, among the<br />\nnames of the crimson wearers, the following six: Chaffee, Stevenson, Hoquet,<br />\nAlvord, Michell, Goddard.

The aim of the editors has been t<br />\nas much representative of the whole college as possible\u2014a book of<br />\nit<br />\nmake<br />\nreference for every phase of Hopkins life. In this connection, they have given<br />\na list of Hopkins songs much fuller than in preceding editions, which constitute<br />\na welcome feature.<br />\nThe cover is a pleasing combination of University and class colors; the<br />\nbody black and blue, the lettering in white, making the blue and white of '02.<br />\nThe University seal in gold is also shown. The leading article, by President<br />\nRemsen, is entitled \"Reminiscences of Dr. Rowland,\" and contains some<br />\namusing tales of their intimacy on fishing expeditions and the like. Ex-President Gilman also contributes an article on research at the University.<br />\nThese and the other stock features of the book, are, of course, less interesting to the undergrad than the \"stunts.\" Among these will be noticed the<br />\nfurther development of the Hopkins Girl. She is shown as a Class Girl, an<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nAthletic Girl\u2014in seven roles altogether, and attractive in all. The series of<br />\n\"Trophy Room Talks\" will be enjoyed by all who fancy they recognize the<br />\n\"kicker,\" the \"poet,\" and the \"chronic jollier.\" The editors consider, indeed,<br />\nthat the \"roasts\" and \"grinds\" have been distributed so universally and impartially that no one can have cause of complaint.<br />\nThere are minor defects in the book, such as the use of a quotation \"the<br />\nmildest-mannered man,\" cribbed from the '01 book, or slips in proofreading<br />\n(the Hopkins-Gettysburg game is given: \"J. H. U., 0; Gettysburg, 2.\") But it<br />\nis a production worthy of the University, and an improvement over its<br />\npredecessors, as every class book should be.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS- LETTER :<br />\nThe base ball season of 1902 has closed. Doubters and scoffers had said<br />\nthat it was impossible to maintain a team. It was found, however, to be comparatively easy. The chief obstacle that was encountered was the prevalence<br />\nof wet weather for a time around Easter. The promoters and members of the<br />\nteam are delighted with their success. The organization was complete, the<br />\ntraining and practice iegular, obligations were met, engagements fulfilled,<br />\nand<br />\na creditable showing made. The team played three games against competit<br />\nors<br />\nthat were quite out of its class, and thereby subjected itself to defeats in a manner that is usually avoided by Hopkins teams. But only satisfaction can be expressed at the re establishment of intercourse between Hopkins and<br />\nthe Naval<br />\nAcademy. This is an accomplishment of the base ball team. Because<br />\nof the<br />\nfaithfulness and devotion of the men, and the heroic efforts that they<br />\nhad made,<br />\nit was proposed before the Athletic Board to give the team recognition,<br />\nthe claim<br />\nbeing made (which is unquestionably true) that they had done<br />\nquite as much<br />\nhard work for Hopkins as a foot ball team does. The Board, however<br />\n, was<br />\ndisinclined to take any favorable action. This, many think, was a<br />\nmistake.<br />\nThe base ball team had certainly earned recognition. And further,<br />\nthe action,<br />\nor want of action, would indicate that Hopkins does not encourage her sons<br />\nto<br />\nexert themselves in her behalf. But this surely cannot be true;<br />\nthe injustice<br />\nwill soon be corrected.<br />\nR. J. G. McKnight has been named by the men as captain for next<br />\nyear,<br />\nand J. N. Numsen as manager. At least five, and probably seven,<br />\nof this years'<br />\nplayers will return. These men will form a splendid nucleus. Quite<br />\na little<br />\ninterest was manifested in the undertaking this year, and by next spring<br />\nthe<br />\nmovement will have gained more momentum and more intrinsic attractio<br />\nn.<br />\nThose who uphold the \"cause\" are alive to their duties and their opportun<br />\nities.<br />\nThey are ready patiently to contend against obstacles, prejudices,<br />\nindifference,<br />\nopen and secret antagonism. It appears that Hopkins will no longer<br />\nhave to<br />\nbear the reproach of not being able to support a base ball team.<br />\nTo all those who during these strenuous times have given their good<br />\nwill,<br />\nor friendly aid, I express a sincere gratitude.<br />\nJOHN G.

Our men scored more<br />\npoints than all the other competitors combined, and won the surprisingly large<br />\nnumber of twenty-four places in the ten events on the program. In two events,<br />\nthe 220 yard dash and the running high jump, Hopkins won all four places,<br />\nwhile three wearers of Black and Blue made points in several others.<br />\nThe quarter mile run, in which \"Joe\" England clipped 2 1-5 seconds off<br />\nthe State record, was undoubtedly the prettiest race of the day. Our captain<br />\ntook the lead at a furious pace from the start, and was never headed.

Swarthmore was trained to the hour, and for the Hopkins<br />\nmen \"Father Bill's\" various remedies, and '`Mother Bill\" Schmeisser's black<br />\npills certainly did the work.<br />\n. As was predicted, there was no let-up from start to finish, and had Hopkins<br />\nnot been prepared to more than hold the terrific pace which Swarthmore set, the<br />\ntale might have been different. The result was that Hopkins slightly outdid<br />\nthe visitors, even in that heart-breaking first half, and in the second the<br />\nQuakers were downed decisively. At one time particularly, the 'Varsity took<br />\nthings on the jump and scored four goals in 5 minutes and 37 seconds. Such<br />\nwork against a team like Swarthmore has certainly never been equaled in the<br />\nhistory of Hopkins lacrosse.<br />\nIn speaking of the game upon the return of the team to the University,<br />\n\"Billy' Maddren said: \"By golly, boys, I'm glad I wasn't in that game, and<br />\ndo you know why? Just this, the pace was too fast. I could never have held<br />\nit.\"<br />\nApparently there was not a weak spot on the team, and every man con<br />\ntributed a generous share toward carrying off the honors.<br />\nThe first half started with a grand rush, and for 25 minutes the rooters and<br />\nor<br />\nenthusiastic friends were wholly unable to tell whether nervous prostration<br />\nbroke<br />\n'Bernie\"<br />\nlittle<br />\nlast,<br />\nAt<br />\ndeath.<br />\ntheir<br />\nof<br />\nexcessive joy would be the cause<br />\nthe terrible suspense by driving the first goal into the net. A few minutes<br />\nlater Putts repeated the operation, and, before the whistle blew, Beans scored<br />\none for the visitors, making the standing two goals to one.<br />\nThe second half found Hopkins thoroughly aggressive and somewhat faster<br />\nthan Swarthmore. The same rush marked the start, and in less than three<br />\nin genminutes Putts tipped the third goal into the net. Then things woke up<br />\nthan<br />\nless<br />\nin<br />\ngoals<br />\nfour<br />\nof<br />\nn<br />\nphenomeno<br />\nthe<br />\neral. Every man \"got busy,\" and<br />\nfine<br />\nthe<br />\nbut<br />\ngame,<br />\nfast<br />\na<br />\nplay<br />\nto<br />\ncontinued<br />\nsix minutes resulted. Swarthmore<br />\ncovered<br />\nBlanck<br />\nand<br />\nTough<br />\neffectively.<br />\nwork of our defense held them back<br />\nhack like race-horses, and both Schmeissers and Henry Straus did such terrific<br />\nbody checking that Swarthmore's home men literally lost their nerve. Briscoe<br />\nplayed a star game at goal, and handled with wonderful skill all kinds of fancy<br />\nshots which happened to escape the others. On the attack \"Aber\" was much<br />\nin evidence, and got off his usual clever \"stunts\" with little \"Bernie.\" Putts,<br />\nB. Bernheim and Sayler did remarkably clever work on the infield,<br />\n\"Did you win a prize at the Horse Show?\"<br />\n\"You bet I did.

M. C. 1.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE game of May 7th against Georgetown. in which Hopkins lost by the<br />\noverwhelming score of 24 to 1, served as an excellent preparation for the<br />\ncontest of the following Saturday at Westminster. In that game the playing of the Black and Blue reached the proper standard,\u2014a consummation that<br />\nshould have been effected earlier and was hindered only by unavoidable obstacles. Western Maryland was fortunate in scoring. With Whipple pitching like<br />\nclock-work and Hopkins playing an errorless game, the result seemed never<br />\nin doubt.<br />\nThe first runs came in the third inning. McKnight reached first on a fumble by Henry. The next three men drew passes, and McKnight was forced in.<br />\nWright drove a hard one through Simpson and two more runs scored. In the<br />\nfifth inning with Moore and McKnight on bases, Campbell hit a safe one to left<br />\nwhich sent them both home. One more came in the seventh. Whipple singled<br />\nand advanced to second on Crozier's neat sacrifice. From there he scored on<br />\nMoore's beautiful two-bagger to center field.<br />\nWestern Maryland was saved from a shut-out in the eighth inning. Roberts was served up the wrong sort of a curve, and he promptly dropped the ball<br />\nover in the left field garden-patch. McKnight quickly leaped the fence, recovered the ball, and made an astonishing throw all the way into Moore's hand at<br />\nshort stop. Never before had such a feat been accomplished, and Roberts was<br />\nheld on third. From there he ran in on Brown's slow one to short. Brown died<br />\ntrying to steal second, and with him Maryland's hopes.<br />\nThe features of the game for Hopkins were McKnight's throw in the eighth,<br />\nand Moore's remarkable play at short stop. He accepted eleven chances without an error. Whipple pitched in his customary steady way and kept the hits<br />\nharmlessly scattered. For Western Maryland, Brown made the star play in the<br />\nninth inning when he scooped up with one hand a fast grounder past second<br />\nbase, and robbed Marine of a hit. Aydelotte pitched well, except for his wildness in one inning. Hopkins hits, however, came when they were needed, and<br />\nthereby clinched the game.<br />\nHOPKIN8.\u2014Moore, Ft.

Toronto holds the intercollegiate championship of Canada<br />\nfor 1902, and is coming to New York about June 3 to play the Crescent Athletic<br />\nClub. Manager Slemons has received a letter from the management of the<br />\nCanadian twelve, congratulating Hopkins upon its success during the season,<br />\nchallenging us to a contest which shall decide the intercollegiate championship<br />\nof America, the game to be played either here or in New York immediately<br />\nafter the contest with the Crescents.<br />\nAt the dinner given the members of the lacrosse team by Captain Schmeisser on May 14, the question of playing Toronto was brought up and given<br />\nfavorable consideration. Manager Slemons was instructed to make enquiries as<br />\nto whether we shall be able to secure the American League grounds. On<br />\naccount of base ball, these cannot be gotten before June 11. If the Canadians<br />\ncan he persuaded to play the Crescents about June 9, and come to Baltimore<br />\nseveral days later, the game is not only possible but very probable.<br />\nShould we win or lose, such a contest would give a wonderful stimulus to<br />\nthe popularity of the sport among Baltimoreans Our team is acknowledged as<br />\nbeing the strongest ever turned out by Hopkins, and there is a bare possibility<br />\nthat we might. beat the Canadians at their own game.
