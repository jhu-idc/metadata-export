Local orchestras will<br />\nfurnish the music, the dances will be all held at Homewood,<br />\nand local talent will do much of the decorating and electrical<br />\nwork. The NEWS-LETTER was scarcely prepared for such a<br />\npleasant surprise, but it hastens to give the usual three cheers<br />\nfor Chairman Colt and his committee. They obviously are the<br />\nstuff; they are responsible for great dope on June Week.<br />\nThe mere fact that /the tickets will be cheaper is n.olt<br />\nresponsible for all of our applause. Not at all; not at all.<br />\nThe largest share goes to a June Week Committee with level<br />\nheads,\u2014a committee that does not want to splurge for the sake<br />\nof spending, but which abandons such ribald plans for more<br />\nconservative and more sensible ones.<br />\nWe little expected to see such a transformation in our<br />\ntimes, but, as long as it has been made, we are willing to risk<br />\na free ticket to the whole affair that everyone will have as fine<br />\na time as if the committee had spent thousands more than the<br />\ncustomary sum.<br />\nHooray for the June Week Committee!<br />\n<br />\nEND THE SUSPENSE<br />\nWhile Dr. Goodnow continues to urge the adoption of his<br />\ntwo-year plan upon the Board of Trustees, that august body of<br />\nconservative Americans does not hasten to make a decision<br />\nupon the question. It considers, it weighs results in the balance, and, we believe, is awaiting assured financial support<br />\nbefore committing itself. We are of the opinion that the Trustees favor the plan, but in order to appear to act in their usual<br />\nconservative manner, do not hasten to put themselves on record<br />\none way or the other.<br />\nNow the NEWS-LETTER, for reasons which it considers to be<br />\ngood and sufficient, and which Editor Hiss let loose upon an<br />\nappalled world last Spring, is decidedly in favor of the New<br />\n, Plan. But we want to know what the future status of the<br />\nUniversity will be. We wait with bated breath; we anxiously<br />\nscan every bulletin for some signs of action; we pant with the<br />\neager expectation of a decision; we pray for the Trustees every<br />\nnight. Is the New Plan going through, or will the present<br />\n-undergraduate school remain?<br />\nThere has been ample time for the Trustees to scan every<br />\n:side of the problem; there have been sufficient days, weeks, and<br />\nmonths for them to act in a manner conservative enough to<br />\nsatisfy the requirements of even the Maryland Club ,\u2014so we<br />\nare hinting gracefully and gently that the world awaits their<br />\ndecision. End the suspense.<br />\nHowever, we are willing to bet our best hat that there will<br />\nbe no word until February 22. At that time Dr. Goodnow will<br />\narise to make the customary announcements and will say that<br />\nfuture. Does anythe plan will be put into effect in the near'<br />\none want to take our wager?<br />\n<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER is pleased -to announce the election of<br />\nRichard R.

Local orchestras will<br />\nfurnish the music, the dances will be all held at Homewood,<br />\nand local talent will do much of the decorating and electrical<br />\nwork. The NEWS-LETTER was scarcely prepared for such a<br />\npleasant surprise, but it hastens to give the usual three cheers<br />\nfor Chairman Colt and his committee. They obviously are the<br />\nstuff; they are responsible for great dope on June Week.<br />\nThe mere fact that /the tickets will be cheaper is n.olt<br />\nresponsible for all of our applause. Not at all; not at all.<br />\nThe largest share goes to a June Week Committee with level<br />\nheads,\u2014a committee that does not want to splurge for the sake<br />\nof spending, but which abandons such ribald plans for more<br />\nconservative and more sensible ones.<br />\nWe little expected to see such a transformation in our<br />\ntimes, but, as long as it has been made, we are willing to risk<br />\na free ticket to the whole affair that everyone will have as fine<br />\na time as if the committee had spent thousands more than the<br />\ncustomary sum.<br />\nHooray for the June Week Committee!<br /><br />\nEND THE SUSPENSE<br />\nWhile Dr. Goodnow continues to urge the adoption of his<br />\ntwo-year plan upon the Board of Trustees, that august body of<br />\nconservative Americans does not hasten to make a decision<br />\nupon the question. It considers, it weighs results in the balance, and, we believe, is awaiting assured financial support<br />\nbefore committing itself. We are of the opinion that the Trustees favor the plan, but in order to appear to act in their usual<br />\nconservative manner, do not hasten to put themselves on record<br />\none way or the other.<br />\nNow the NEWS-LETTER, for reasons which it considers to be<br />\ngood and sufficient, and which Editor Hiss let loose upon an<br />\nappalled world last Spring, is decidedly in favor of the New<br />\n, Plan. But we want to know what the future status of the<br />\nUniversity will be. We wait with bated breath; we anxiously<br />\nscan every bulletin for some signs of action; we pant with the<br />\neager expectation of a decision; we pray for the Trustees every<br />\nnight. Is the New Plan going through, or will the present<br />\n-undergraduate school remain?<br />\nThere has been ample time for the Trustees to scan every<br />\n:side of the problem; there have been sufficient days, weeks, and<br />\nmonths for them to act in a manner conservative enough to<br />\nsatisfy the requirements of even the Maryland Club ,\u2014so we<br />\nare hinting gracefully and gently that the world awaits their<br />\ndecision. End the suspense.<br />\nHowever, we are willing to bet our best hat that there will<br />\nbe no word until February 22. At that time Dr. Goodnow will<br />\narise to make the customary announcements and will say that<br />\nfuture. Does anythe plan will be put into effect in the near'<br />\none want to take our wager?<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER is pleased -to announce the election of<br />\nRichard R.
