Lambrose plunged over to account for St. John's only score. The<br />\nplacement was not good.<br />\nThroughout<br />\n<br />\nthis period Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nwas constantly in danger, and, if not<br />\nfor the magnificent kicking of Pasarew and the stubborn defense of<br />\nthe line in the pinches, the Johnnies<br />\nmight have pushed across at least<br />\nonce more.

Lambrose plunged over to account for St. John's only score. The<br />\nplacement was not good.<br />\nThroughout<br /><br />\nthis period Hopkins<br /><br />\nwas constantly in danger, and, if not<br />\nfor the magnificent kicking of Pasarew and the stubborn defense of<br />\nthe line in the pinches, the Johnnies<br />\nmight have pushed across at least<br />\nonce more.
