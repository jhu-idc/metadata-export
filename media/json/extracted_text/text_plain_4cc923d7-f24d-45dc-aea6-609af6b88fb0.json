The debate was<br />\nheld in Brua Chapel and was presided over by Prof. P. M. Bikle,<br />\nPh. D., who read the regulations<br />\ngoverning the affair and introduced<br />\nthe speakers.<br />\nFor Gettysburg Messrs. C. M.<br />\nDavis and E. J. Bowman spoke in<br />\naffirmation of the question: \"Resolved, That the present distribution of powers between the Federal<br />\nand State governments should be<br />\nrevised in accordance with a general policy of further centralization.\" The . negative \u2022 was maintained by W. 0. Weyforth and T.<br />\nB. Price for Johns Hopkins.<br />\nMusic was furnished during the<br />\nintermissions by the college orchestra. The judges were Dr. B. 0.<br />\nMcIntyre, Prof. U. S. Steele and<br />\nDr. W. D. Rorer.<br />\nThe speakers for the, affirmative<br />\nboth presented very strong arguments, which were to a large extent<br />\nentirely different from those offered<br />\nby the affirmative in the recent interclass debate in McCoy Hall. Mr.<br />\nDavis in particular, though excelled<br />\nby his colleague in delivery, made<br />\na very strong and thoughtful<br />\nspeech, involving some rather intricate political reasoning. In reply,<br />\nMr. Weyforth contended that a policy of centralization was entirely<br />\nunnecessary, while Mr. Price took<br />\nthe position that it was decidedly<br />\nundesirable. Great credit is due the<br />\nformer for the excellent showing<br />\nhe made, in view of the fact that he<br />\nhad less than a week in which to<br />\nprepare the whole subject.<br />\nFollowing the set speeches, which<br />\nwere . . each twenty minutes in<br />\nlength, each man spoke briefly in<br />\nrebuttal. Hopkins scored here by<br />\nattacking the general nature of the<br />\naffirmative's debate and calling for<br />\nspecific instances in which a policy<br />\nof centralization would help the nation.<br />\nAt the conclusion of the program<br />\nProfessor Bikle spared the feelings<br />\nof both speakers and audience by<br />\nannouncing the decision\u2022in favor of<br />\nthe negative without the usual long<br />\npreamble.. The debate Was generally considered to have been extremely close, but the decision of<br />\nthe judges was accepted by the partisans of GettYsburg in a graceful<br />\nfashion.<br />\n<br />\nAs a special session of the Third<br />\nNational Peace Congress, the fifth<br />\nannual interstate oratorical contest<br />\nof the Intercollegiate Peace Assorciation will be held in McCoy Hall,<br />\nFriday, May 5, at 8.15 P. M. At<br />\nthe same time the banquet of the<br />\nCongress will take place at the Belvedere Hotel; but as the number of<br />\nsubscriptions to the banquet is limited, it is not thought that this function will materially interfere with<br />\nthe attendance at McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe contest will be in charge .of<br />\nthe Intercollegiate Peace Association, which offers two prizes, $75<br />\nand $50, for first and second honors, respectively. The President of<br />\nthe Association, Dean William P.<br />\nRodgers, of the Cincinnati Law<br />\nSchool,is expected to preside. There<br />\nwill be sevei. contestants, representing the seven States of Wisconsin,<br />\nMichigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,<br />\nPennsylvania, and Maryland. Each<br />\nof these contestants.has this spring<br />\nwon the oratorical contest held betWeen the colleges of his own State.<br />\nThese seven men have been chosen<br />\nas the best out of about 300 orators, representing seventy-five colleges, so that the orations to be delivered Friday evening promise to<br />\nbe highly meritorious.<br />\nThe details of the contest are being arranged by the Johns Hopkins<br />\nArbitration Society, co-operating<br />\nwith the University and the officials<br />\nof. the Peace Congress. Invitations<br />\nissued by the University will be<br />\ndistributed early in the week, and<br />\nit is hoped that the members of the<br />\nUniversity will feel responsible for<br />\ngiving as much publicity as possible<br />\nto the contest.

The final<br />\nscore does not indicate the intensity<br />\nof the contest, for the score was<br />\nevened up four times during the<br />\ngame.<br />\nEvery member of the team should<br />\nbe given full credit, for they all<br />\nshowed true grit and skill. Stockett, Captain Hulburt and Gail<br />\nstarred on the close attack; Bennie<br />\nKline and Wolfe were invincible in<br />\nthe midfield, and G. Schmeisser,<br />\nHopkins and Gillet were most aggressive on the defense. Perkins,<br />\nMesner, P. Roberts, and C. Collins<br />\nstarred for Swarthmore.<br />\n- Swarthmore was unnecessarily<br />\nrough at times and lost no opportunity to whack a Hopkins man<br />\nacross the head. Luckily, only one<br />\nHopkins man was injured, and that<br />\nwas Benedict, who suffered a nasty<br />\nscalp wound from a blow that cut<br />\nthrough the thickest part of his padded cap. Benedict pluckily continued in the game.<br />\nCaptain Hulburt scored first blood<br />\nfor Hopkins when he slipped in a<br />\ntricky low one past Goalkeeper Atkinson. Wolfe made the second<br />\ntally by beautiful individual work,<br />\nwhen he ran two-thirds the length<br />\nof the field, dodging the entire<br />\nSwarthmore defense and shooting<br />\ngoal.<br />\nWith two goals registered for<br />\nHopkins, the ire of the Swarthmore attack was aroused and they<br />\nstarted one of their famous Canadian-style onslaughts. P. Roberts,<br />\ntheir experienced inhome, snapped<br />\nin their first tally. The first half<br />\nended with the score 4 to 4.<br />\nHopkins started out with the first<br />\ntally in the second session, which<br />\nwas due to the clever work of<br />\nStockett. This nimble first attack,<br />\nafter missing a low shot, caught the<br />\nquick return from behind the net<br />\nand dropped the -ball in the net<br />\nwithout the Swarthmore goaltender<br />\nso much as moving.<br />\nThe score continued to see-saw<br />\nback and forth in the second session. But with one marvelous<br />\nburst of.energy Hopkins scored six<br />\ngoals in rapid succession and put<br />\nthe game on ice. The line-up:<br />\nHopkins\u2014Sutton, g.; Schmeisser,<br />\np.; Niles, cp.; Benedict, id.; Hopkins, 2d.; Gillet, 3d.; Wolfe, c.;<br />\nTappan and Gail, 3a.'; Kline, 2a.;<br />\n<br />\nThe exercises of the thirty-fifth<br />\nannual commencement will be held<br />\nat the Academy of Music on Tuesday, June 13, at 4 o'clock.

The<br />\nstep, though generally disapproved,<br />\nis felt to be necessary to maintain<br />\nthe usefulness of the group, whose<br />\nmembership has fallen off 6o per<br />\ncent, during the last five years. A<br />\nlarge partof this decrease is thought<br />\nto be directly due to the requirements in Latin, which many men<br />\npreferred to avoid by entering one<br />\nof the scientific groups. Whether,<br />\nhowever, this is the real reason for<br />\nthe popularity of the latter groups,<br />\nwhether the change will produce<br />\nany material ,effect, and what will<br />\nbe the result of the anti-classical<br />\ntendency that it evinces in this day<br />\nwhen a reaction against anti-classicism seems about to set in, are questions which must be answered by<br />\nthe future.<br />\n<br />\nHorrax came up to the expectations of his supporters at the Pennsylvania meet in Philadelphia<br />\n,on<br />\nSaturday.

D.<br />\nBroadway at 120th Street, New York City<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Moore, of Columbia, Delivers<br />\nFour Very Interesting \"Foundation\" Lectures.<br />\nEvery student who has not heard<br />\nthe lectures of Dr. Moore, of Columbia, on \"The Schouler Foundation\" has missed hearing four very<br />\ninteresting lectures. In the first lecture Dr. Moore said that the love of<br />\nliberty, the directness of action and<br />\nthe confidence of power possessed<br />\nby the American colonies induced<br />\nthem to throw off the commercial<br />\nrestrictions which England imposed<br />\non them. The causes which brought<br />\nabout a feeling of unity among the<br />\ncolonies were the publication of<br />\nPaine's \"Common Sense,\" a fiery<br />\nappeal to unity, and the fact that<br />\nas a nation we prepared to ask<br />\nSpain and France to help its against<br />\nEngland if Portugal captured our<br />\nships. The four courses that induced our fathers in the Constitution to break down the sovereignty<br />\nof the States were: (I) In the<br />\nTreaty of Paris, England ceded to<br />\nus a great deal of land which belonged to no one State;(2) the central government guaranteed by the<br />\nTreaty of Paris that citizens within<br />\nthe States would pay the debts<br />\nwhich they owed Englishmen; (3)<br />\nwithout greater federalization than<br />\nwas provided for in the Articles of<br />\nConfederation we could not defend<br />\nour frontiers or establish national<br />\ncredit; and the most important factor of all, our commerce, was continually extending.<br />\nIn the second lecture Dr. Moore<br />\npointed out some effect of the wave<br />\nof Democracy which has swept over<br />\nour country. On this wave were<br />\nborne such reforms as the taking<br />\nthe right of nominating candidates<br />\nfor the Presidency from the small<br />\nbody of electors and giving the<br />\nright to popular conventions, the<br />\nbreaking down of religious and<br />\nproperty' qualifications for voters<br />\nand the popular election. of Federal<br />\njudges. The democratic attitude<br />\nof the people is shown by the resolutions in favor of the independence<br />\nof Greece and other countries<br />\nwhich they forced Congress to pass.<br />\nIn his third lecture Dr. Moore<br />\ngave it as his opinion that the imperialistic period of our history began when, disregarding the Constitution, Lincoln was given the<br />\npowers of a dictator. After the<br />\nCivil War it was impossible for the<br />\nStates to bear as independent a relation to the central government as<br />\nthey had borne before; on the contrary, imperialism, on account of<br />\nour growing interstate commerce<br />\nand the needs of our national life,<br />\nhas been gaining ground.<br />\nDr. Moore, in his concluding lecture, said that in the march across<br />\nthe Continent, the American people<br />\nhave been actuated by a belief that<br />\nby manifest destiny a united people<br />\nlike ours should possess a united<br />\ncountry. But not only North America, but South America and the<br />\nwhole world are a united country;<br />\nso one might think that manifest<br />\n<br />\ndestiny has just begun to shower<br />\nblessings upon us. Of the land outside of America which we have annexed, a part, which we could not<br />\nget by treaty, we took by legislation; and when our sense of missionary duty has not been strong<br />\nenough to induce us to annex new<br />\nland our sense of commercial advantage usually has been.<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa Banquet.<br />\nArrangements for the annual<br />\nbanquet of the Baltimore Chapter<br />\nof Phi Beta Kappa, which is to be<br />\nheld Saturday, May 6, are being<br />\ncompleted by Prof. Murray P.<br />\nBrush, chairman of the committee.<br />\nBefore the banquet an election will<br />\nbe held for the selection of new<br />\nmembers, the honor men of the senior class.

The judges,<br />\nJudge Heuisler and Judge Bond, of<br />\nthe Baltimore city bench, and Mr.<br />\nEugene O'Dunne, of the Baltimore<br />\nbar, were, however, not unanimous<br />\nin their decision.<br />\nMr. Bobbitt, of Johns Hopkins,<br />\nthe first speaker of the affirmative,<br />\nopened the debate. He contended<br />\nthat could the affirmative show that<br />\nfunctions of substantial importance<br />\nnow exercised by the individual<br />\nStates should be entrusted to the<br />\nFederal Government then the affirmative would have proved its<br />\ncase; and he devoted his speech to<br />\nthe exposition of certain evils which<br />\nhave grown up under State control<br />\nof corporations, labor organizations,<br />\nchild labor, conservation, etc., and<br />\nto an examination into the reasons<br />\nwhy the individual States are fundamentally unable to remedy these<br />\nevils.<br />\nMr. Babbitt was followed by the<br />\nfirst speaker of the negative, Mr. J.<br />\nC. Herndon, whose speech consisted<br />\nof an enumeration of the constitutional powers of the central government and of the functions which<br />\nunder these powers that government can exercise.<br />\nThe second speaker of the affirmative, Mr. Leo Wolman, continued the arguments of Mr. Bobbitt and explained why in a great<br />\nvariety of matters the national government is better qualified to be<br />\nthe repository of power than the<br />\nState governments. He also maintained that the transference of all<br />\nproblems which become national in<br />\nimportance to Federal control,<br />\nthough it constitutes a general pol(Continued on page 5, col. 1.)<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

The game was not an easy<br />\none by any means, but the Black<br />\nand Blue boys won, and that was all<br />\nthey wanted. The game was a<br />\nfight from start to finish. Although<br />\nthe game was rough, none of the<br />\nHopkins men were hurt. Sutton<br />\nstopped shot after shot which<br />\nseemed a sure goal.

The debate was<br />\nheld in Brua Chapel and was presided over by Prof. P. M. Bikle,<br />\nPh. D., who read the regulations<br />\ngoverning the affair and introduced<br />\nthe speakers.<br />\nFor Gettysburg Messrs. C. M.<br />\nDavis and E. J. Bowman spoke in<br />\naffirmation of the question: \"Resolved, That the present distribution of powers between the Federal<br />\nand State governments should be<br />\nrevised in accordance with a general policy of further centralization.\" The . negative \u2022 was maintained by W. 0. Weyforth and T.<br />\nB. Price for Johns Hopkins.<br />\nMusic was furnished during the<br />\nintermissions by the college orchestra. The judges were Dr. B. 0.<br />\nMcIntyre, Prof. U. S. Steele and<br />\nDr. W. D. Rorer.<br />\nThe speakers for the, affirmative<br />\nboth presented very strong arguments, which were to a large extent<br />\nentirely different from those offered<br />\nby the affirmative in the recent interclass debate in McCoy Hall. Mr.<br />\nDavis in particular, though excelled<br />\nby his colleague in delivery, made<br />\na very strong and thoughtful<br />\nspeech, involving some rather intricate political reasoning. In reply,<br />\nMr. Weyforth contended that a policy of centralization was entirely<br />\nunnecessary, while Mr. Price took<br />\nthe position that it was decidedly<br />\nundesirable. Great credit is due the<br />\nformer for the excellent showing<br />\nhe made, in view of the fact that he<br />\nhad less than a week in which to<br />\nprepare the whole subject.<br />\nFollowing the set speeches, which<br />\nwere . . each twenty minutes in<br />\nlength, each man spoke briefly in<br />\nrebuttal. Hopkins scored here by<br />\nattacking the general nature of the<br />\naffirmative's debate and calling for<br />\nspecific instances in which a policy<br />\nof centralization would help the nation.<br />\nAt the conclusion of the program<br />\nProfessor Bikle spared the feelings<br />\nof both speakers and audience by<br />\nannouncing the decision\u2022in favor of<br />\nthe negative without the usual long<br />\npreamble.. The debate Was generally considered to have been extremely close, but the decision of<br />\nthe judges was accepted by the partisans of GettYsburg in a graceful<br />\nfashion.<br /><br />\nAs a special session of the Third<br />\nNational Peace Congress, the fifth<br />\nannual interstate oratorical contest<br />\nof the Intercollegiate Peace Assorciation will be held in McCoy Hall,<br />\nFriday, May 5, at 8.15 P. M. At<br />\nthe same time the banquet of the<br />\nCongress will take place at the Belvedere Hotel; but as the number of<br />\nsubscriptions to the banquet is limited, it is not thought that this function will materially interfere with<br />\nthe attendance at McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe contest will be in charge .of<br />\nthe Intercollegiate Peace Association, which offers two prizes, $75<br />\nand $50, for first and second honors, respectively. The President of<br />\nthe Association, Dean William P.<br />\nRodgers, of the Cincinnati Law<br />\nSchool,is expected to preside. There<br />\nwill be sevei. contestants, representing the seven States of Wisconsin,<br />\nMichigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,<br />\nPennsylvania, and Maryland. Each<br />\nof these contestants.has this spring<br />\nwon the oratorical contest held betWeen the colleges of his own State.<br />\nThese seven men have been chosen<br />\nas the best out of about 300 orators, representing seventy-five colleges, so that the orations to be delivered Friday evening promise to<br />\nbe highly meritorious.<br />\nThe details of the contest are being arranged by the Johns Hopkins<br />\nArbitration Society, co-operating<br />\nwith the University and the officials<br />\nof. the Peace Congress. Invitations<br />\nissued by the University will be<br />\ndistributed early in the week, and<br />\nit is hoped that the members of the<br />\nUniversity will feel responsible for<br />\ngiving as much publicity as possible<br />\nto the contest.

The final<br />\nscore does not indicate the intensity<br />\nof the contest, for the score was<br />\nevened up four times during the<br />\ngame.<br />\nEvery member of the team should<br />\nbe given full credit, for they all<br />\nshowed true grit and skill. Stockett, Captain Hulburt and Gail<br />\nstarred on the close attack; Bennie<br />\nKline and Wolfe were invincible in<br />\nthe midfield, and G. Schmeisser,<br />\nHopkins and Gillet were most aggressive on the defense. Perkins,<br />\nMesner, P. Roberts, and C. Collins<br />\nstarred for Swarthmore.<br />\n- Swarthmore was unnecessarily<br />\nrough at times and lost no opportunity to whack a Hopkins man<br />\nacross the head. Luckily, only one<br />\nHopkins man was injured, and that<br />\nwas Benedict, who suffered a nasty<br />\nscalp wound from a blow that cut<br />\nthrough the thickest part of his padded cap. Benedict pluckily continued in the game.<br />\nCaptain Hulburt scored first blood<br />\nfor Hopkins when he slipped in a<br />\ntricky low one past Goalkeeper Atkinson. Wolfe made the second<br />\ntally by beautiful individual work,<br />\nwhen he ran two-thirds the length<br />\nof the field, dodging the entire<br />\nSwarthmore defense and shooting<br />\ngoal.<br />\nWith two goals registered for<br />\nHopkins, the ire of the Swarthmore attack was aroused and they<br />\nstarted one of their famous Canadian-style onslaughts. P. Roberts,<br />\ntheir experienced inhome, snapped<br />\nin their first tally. The first half<br />\nended with the score 4 to 4.<br />\nHopkins started out with the first<br />\ntally in the second session, which<br />\nwas due to the clever work of<br />\nStockett. This nimble first attack,<br />\nafter missing a low shot, caught the<br />\nquick return from behind the net<br />\nand dropped the -ball in the net<br />\nwithout the Swarthmore goaltender<br />\nso much as moving.<br />\nThe score continued to see-saw<br />\nback and forth in the second session. But with one marvelous<br />\nburst of.energy Hopkins scored six<br />\ngoals in rapid succession and put<br />\nthe game on ice. The line-up:<br />\nHopkins\u2014Sutton, g.; Schmeisser,<br />\np.; Niles, cp.; Benedict, id.; Hopkins, 2d.; Gillet, 3d.; Wolfe, c.;<br />\nTappan and Gail, 3a.'; Kline, 2a.;<br /><br />\nThe exercises of the thirty-fifth<br />\nannual commencement will be held<br />\nat the Academy of Music on Tuesday, June 13, at 4 o'clock.

The<br />\nstep, though generally disapproved,<br />\nis felt to be necessary to maintain<br />\nthe usefulness of the group, whose<br />\nmembership has fallen off 6o per<br />\ncent, during the last five years. A<br />\nlarge partof this decrease is thought<br />\nto be directly due to the requirements in Latin, which many men<br />\npreferred to avoid by entering one<br />\nof the scientific groups.

D.<br />\nBroadway at 120th Street, New York City<br /><br />\nProfessor Moore, of Columbia, Delivers<br />\nFour Very Interesting \"Foundation\" Lectures.<br />\nEvery student who has not heard<br />\nthe lectures of Dr. Moore, of Columbia, on \"The Schouler Foundation\" has missed hearing four very<br />\ninteresting lectures. In the first lecture Dr. Moore said that the love of<br />\nliberty, the directness of action and<br />\nthe confidence of power possessed<br />\nby the American colonies induced<br />\nthem to throw off the commercial<br />\nrestrictions which England imposed<br />\non them. The causes which brought<br />\nabout a feeling of unity among the<br />\ncolonies were the publication of<br />\nPaine's \"Common Sense,\" a fiery<br />\nappeal to unity, and the fact that<br />\nas a nation we prepared to ask<br />\nSpain and France to help its against<br />\nEngland if Portugal captured our<br />\nships. The four courses that induced our fathers in the Constitution to break down the sovereignty<br />\nof the States were: (I) In the<br />\nTreaty of Paris, England ceded to<br />\nus a great deal of land which belonged to no one State;(2) the central government guaranteed by the<br />\nTreaty of Paris that citizens within<br />\nthe States would pay the debts<br />\nwhich they owed Englishmen; (3)<br />\nwithout greater federalization than<br />\nwas provided for in the Articles of<br />\nConfederation we could not defend<br />\nour frontiers or establish national<br />\ncredit; and the most important factor of all, our commerce, was continually extending.<br />\nIn the second lecture Dr. Moore<br />\npointed out some effect of the wave<br />\nof Democracy which has swept over<br />\nour country. On this wave were<br />\nborne such reforms as the taking<br />\nthe right of nominating candidates<br />\nfor the Presidency from the small<br />\nbody of electors and giving the<br />\nright to popular conventions, the<br />\nbreaking down of religious and<br />\nproperty' qualifications for voters<br />\nand the popular election. of Federal<br />\njudges. The democratic attitude<br />\nof the people is shown by the resolutions in favor of the independence<br />\nof Greece and other countries<br />\nwhich they forced Congress to pass.<br />\nIn his third lecture Dr. Moore<br />\ngave it as his opinion that the imperialistic period of our history began when, disregarding the Constitution, Lincoln was given the<br />\npowers of a dictator. After the<br />\nCivil War it was impossible for the<br />\nStates to bear as independent a relation to the central government as<br />\nthey had borne before; on the contrary, imperialism, on account of<br />\nour growing interstate commerce<br />\nand the needs of our national life,<br />\nhas been gaining ground.<br />\nDr. Moore, in his concluding lecture, said that in the march across<br />\nthe Continent, the American people<br />\nhave been actuated by a belief that<br />\nby manifest destiny a united people<br />\nlike ours should possess a united<br />\ncountry. But not only North America, but South America and the<br />\nwhole world are a united country;<br />\nso one might think that manifest<br /><br />\ndestiny has just begun to shower<br />\nblessings upon us. Of the land outside of America which we have annexed, a part, which we could not<br />\nget by treaty, we took by legislation; and when our sense of missionary duty has not been strong<br />\nenough to induce us to annex new<br />\nland our sense of commercial advantage usually has been.<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa Banquet.<br />\nArrangements for the annual<br />\nbanquet of the Baltimore Chapter<br />\nof Phi Beta Kappa, which is to be<br />\nheld Saturday, May 6, are being<br />\ncompleted by Prof. Murray P.<br />\nBrush, chairman of the committee.<br />\nBefore the banquet an election will<br />\nbe held for the selection of new<br />\nmembers, the honor men of the senior class.

The judges,<br />\nJudge Heuisler and Judge Bond, of<br />\nthe Baltimore city bench, and Mr.<br />\nEugene O'Dunne, of the Baltimore<br />\nbar, were, however, not unanimous<br />\nin their decision.<br />\nMr. Bobbitt, of Johns Hopkins,<br />\nthe first speaker of the affirmative,<br />\nopened the debate. He contended<br />\nthat could the affirmative show that<br />\nfunctions of substantial importance<br />\nnow exercised by the individual<br />\nStates should be entrusted to the<br />\nFederal Government then the affirmative would have proved its<br />\ncase; and he devoted his speech to<br />\nthe exposition of certain evils which<br />\nhave grown up under State control<br />\nof corporations, labor organizations,<br />\nchild labor, conservation, etc., and<br />\nto an examination into the reasons<br />\nwhy the individual States are fundamentally unable to remedy these<br />\nevils.<br />\nMr. Babbitt was followed by the<br />\nfirst speaker of the negative, Mr. J.<br />\nC. Herndon, whose speech consisted<br />\nof an enumeration of the constitutional powers of the central government and of the functions which<br />\nunder these powers that government can exercise.<br />\nThe second speaker of the affirmative, Mr. Leo Wolman, continued the arguments of Mr. Bobbitt and explained why in a great<br />\nvariety of matters the national government is better qualified to be<br />\nthe repository of power than the<br />\nState governments. He also maintained that the transference of all<br />\nproblems which become national in<br />\nimportance to Federal control,<br />\nthough it constitutes a general pol(Continued on page 5, col. 1.)<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

The team played one of the<br />\nbest games so far, as was shown by<br />\nthe way the attack men were working together, and they had no trouble in scoring goals on the Northern team.<br />\nOn April 15 the Varsity defeated<br />\nHarvard by a close score-3 to 2.<br />\nAlthough the score was close, Hopkins did not have much trouble in<br />\ndefeating them. The game was all<br />\nHopkins from the start, and the<br />\nboys wanted to save themselves for<br />\nthe following Saturday,. when they<br />\nplayed the Indians, one of the best<br />\nteams in the country.<br />\nOn April 22, with a great shock<br />\nto the Indians and much surprise<br />\nto the spectators, Hopkins walked<br />\naway with the game by the score of<br />\n8 to 5. The game was not an easy<br />\none by any means, but the Black<br />\nand Blue boys won, and that was all<br />\nthey wanted. The game was a<br />\nfight from start to finish. Although<br />\nthe game was rough, none of the<br />\nHopkins men were hurt. Sutton<br />\nstopped shot after shot which<br />\nseemed a sure goal. The mid-field<br />\nmen worked beautifully together for<br />\nthe first time this year. . One of the<br />\nIndians had his arm broken in some<br />\nmysterious manner.<br /><br />\nMuch to the surprise of the large<br />\ncrowd of spectators who went to<br />\nHomewood last Saturday afternoon, the Hopkins baseball team received a severe trouncing at the<br />\nhands of the Western Maryland<br />\nnine. The score was 9 to 2. Hopkins was not only beaten, but badly<br />\nbeaten, and partly because of ragged playing.<br />\nThe up-State boys played an errorless game and deserved to win.<br />\nTwigg was very effective in the<br />\nbox, allowing only four hits, and he<br />\nreceived excellent support from his<br />\nteam mates.<br />\nThe Western Maryland players<br />\ntouched up Silvester, the Hopkins<br />\ntwirler, for thirteen hits. Stultz, the<br />\nfirst batter up, swatted the first ball<br />\nthrown for a clean single. Sprague.<br />\nbunted safely, Stultz going to second. Stultz scored on a wild throw<br />\nto first of Graefe's easy grounder.<br />\nSprague was nailed at the plate in<br />\nattempting to run home after Webster had caught Dooley's fly. Graefe<br />\nscored on a passed ball.<br />\nWestern Maryland scored two<br />\nmore runs in the fourth inning,<br />\nwhen Beall knocked the ball over<br />\nthe right-field fence into the boulevard for a home run with Meyer on<br />\nfirst.<br />\nHopkins made its only runs in the<br />\nsecond half of the fourth inning.<br />\nDEBATE A TIE<br />\nShaw was given a pass and Wilson,<br />\nthe next batter up, hit the ball over<br />\n(Continued from page 4.)<br />\nthe left fielder's head for a home<br />\nicy of further centralization, need run.
