Goodnow will be<br />\nformally inaugurated as president<br />\nof the University on or about May<br />\n20 at Homewood. The announcement of the date and place was<br />\nfirst made last week to a representative of THE NEws-LETTER.<br />\nDetails for the installation exercises, however, have not been completed, and two plans of procedure<br />\nare under consideration. One idea<br />\nis to have the exercises out of doors<br />\non the lawn just west of the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering<br />\nBuilding. A great tent would be<br />\npitched upon this space, and accommodations for a couple of thousand people thus made. The speakers and guests of honor will be<br />\nseated on the portico of the engineering building. It is pointed out<br />\nthat the building would serve as<br />\nan excellent sounding board for the<br />\nvoices of the speakers.<br />\nThe other plan is to hold the exercises in machinery hall of the<br />\nengineering building. This hall is<br />\nin the form of a great L, and a<br />\nplaform erected at the angle could<br />\nbe seen by nearly two thousand<br />\npersons comfortably seated in the<br />\nwings.<br />\nThe occasion will have a double<br />\nsignificance, being not only the inauguration of the third president,<br />\nbut also the formal dedication of<br />\nthe Homewood Estate. The idea<br />\nof holding the exercises in the engineering building resulted from the<br />\ndesire to honor the State in some<br />\nmanner showing appreciation of the<br />\nassistance given in the establishment of the technical department.<br />\nAt all events, the occasion will be<br />\ndistinctly a Maryland affair, and it<br />\nIS said that if arrangements can<br />\nhe satisfactorily completed, the exercises will be held in the building<br />\nprovided by the State\u2014the engineering building.<br />\nA large number of invitations<br />\nwill be sent out, and the day' undoubtedly will be marked by the<br />\ngathering of some of the foremost<br />\neducators in the country.<br />\nAnother feature will be the<br />\nformal opening of the two new<br />\nbuildings at Homewood. After the<br />\nexercises the doors of the engineering building and of Gilman Hall<br />\nwill be thrown open, and visitors<br />\nwill be invited to inspect them. Gilman Hall is considered a \"model<br />\nlibrary building,\" and will undoubtedly attract a great deal of attention.<br />\nThe plans, ,however, are only<br />\ntentative, but both of the ideas will<br />\nbe notable for the manner in which<br />\n<br />\nThe annual interclass meet, held<br />\nin the cage last Saturday. was a<br />\nwalk-over for the sophomores, who<br />\npiled up a score of 64 points to 13.<br />\nWiggins and Mealy were the only<br />\npoint winners for the Class of 'i8:<br />\nthe former winning- the high jump<br />\n1 2 inches and taking<br />\nat 5 feet 2/<br />\nsecond place in the broad jump to<br />\nBinford, who won the event with<br />\na jump of 19 feet 2Y4 inches.<br />\nMealy surprised everybody by his<br />\npretty performance in the mile run.<br />\nTaking a considerable lead from<br />\nthe start, he maintained his advantage and finished a good 20 yards<br />\nahead of German, '17, in the fairly<br />\ngood time of 5 minutes 16 seconds.<br />\nBinford and Brooks were the<br />\nhigh point winners for the sophomores. By winning the broad jump,<br />\ntying for first in the quarter mile,<br />\ntaking second place in the 30-yard<br />\nluirdles and running third in the<br />\nwinning sophomore relay, Binford<br />\nPiled up 13 4 points. He also won<br />\nhis heat in the 30-yard dash, but a<br />\npoor start in the finals lost him a<br />\nplace in this event. Brooks won<br />\nthe shot put at 32 feet 1 inch and<br />\nalso took second place in the high<br />\njump and the 30-yard dash, making<br />\na total of ii points, while Jacobs<br />\ndid nearly as well by winning the<br />\n30-yard dash and the 30-yard hurdles. Ten sophomores in all were<br />\npoint winners.<br />\nThe senior-junior relay race was<br />\none of the most interesting events.<br />\nThe senior team, composed of<br />\nPrince, Voshell, Spencer and Merrick, won by a slight margin in the<br />\nvery good time of 2 minutes 30/5<br />\nseconds. Each man ran three laps<br />\nof the roo-yard track.<br />\nThe meet, as a whole, was rather<br />\nuninterestjng, both because it was<br />\nso one-sided and because no exceptional times were made. Jacobs<br />\nequaled the cage record in the 30yard dash (3', seconds), but no<br />\nother records were even approached.<br />\nThe soft condition of the track was<br />\nprobably partly responsible for this<br />\nfact, as also the lack of keen competition in many of the events. The<br />\ntrack had just been made over and<br />\nhad not had time to become at all<br />\nwell packed.<br />\nThe sophomore-freshman relay<br />\nevent resulted in an overwhelming<br />\nvictory for the '17 men. This was<br />\nthe same team that defeated the<br />\nGeorgetown freshmen last winter.<br />\nThey are as yet undefeated and<br />\nhope to preserve this reputation in<br />\nthe senior-junior events of the next<br />\ntwo years.<br />\n<br />\nBob Layfield, 'Varsity quarterback, was operated upon -last Saturday at the Delaware Hospital, Wilmington, Del. Following the operation, the announcement was made<br />\nthat there is a slight chance for<br />\nhis recovery, this being almost the<br />\nfirst hope held out by attending<br />\nphysicians that the injured player<br />\nhad any real chance for victory in<br />\nhis brave fight to live.<br />\nThe operation was performed by<br />\nDr. William S. Baer, assisted by<br />\nfellow members of the Hopkins<br />\nstaff; Drs. Ronald T. Abercrombie,<br />\nJohn Staige Davis and J. V. Reed.<br />\nThe five physicians with Miss Bonner, a Johns Hopkins nurse, went<br />\nto Wilmington and began at noon<br />\nthe operation which lasted nearly<br />\ntwo hours. They discovered that<br />\nby removing the bones that were<br />\npressing down on the spinal cord,<br />\nthere is a faint hone that the cord<br />\nwould resume its former function.<br />\nThe cord itself was found to be<br />\nslightly contused.<br />\nIt was a most delicate operation,<br />\nand the physicians declare that Bob<br />\nhas still a long and hard road to<br />\ntravel before . ultimate recovery.<br />\nHowever, they say that the patient's<br />\ngrit and rare good fortune may pull<br />\nhim through.,<br />\nBob insisted that the operation be<br />\nperformed. His parents also appealed to Dr. Abercrombie, who last<br />\nWednesday went to Wilmington<br />\nand had a talk with his patient.. On<br />\nhis return he went into consultation<br />\nwith Dr. Baer and they decided to<br />\ntake the last chance to attempt to<br />\nsave the life of the player.<br />\nThe grit and determination displayed by Layfield since his injury<br />\nat South Bethlehem, Pa., on October 31 has alone given him a fighting chance for recovery. Since that<br />\ntime he has insisted that he would<br />\nsoon be well and able to play football again. In spite of sinking<br />\nspells, in one of which his temperature reached '66 -degrees, he has<br />\nfought, through several crises and<br />\nliow has a chance to live. The pin,siCians and surgeons were not optimistic about his recovery and not<br />\nuntil after the operation would they<br />\nsay that Bob had a chance\u2014even a<br />\nslight chance\u2014to recover. From<br />\nthe start, Bob said he would fool<br />\nthem and app`arently he is Winning<br />\nout.<br />\nThe operation has not relieved the<br />\nalmost complete paralysis which has<br />\nextended from Bob'8 neck to his<br />\nfeet from the tinie of the accident.<br />\nPressure on the spinal cord, however, has been greatly relieved, and<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on Page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nA change in the editorship of<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER took place last<br />\nweek, when J. Saulsbury Short, '15,<br />\ntendered his resignation from the<br />\nBoard and Edmund M.

Barton as editor-in-chief,<br />\nis also editor of the Hullabaloo, and<br />\nit was because of the great amount<br />\nof time required in getting. up the<br />\nyear book that he was led to give<br />\nup the weekly. His resignation was<br />\nread at the meeting of the staff on<br />\nMonday, and takes effect with this<br />\nissue. On Thursday night, at a<br />\nmeeting of the entire Board, Dorsey<br />\nRichardson moved that Mr. Spieker<br />\nbe elected unanimously to the position. and the motion was carried.<br />\nThe new editor-in-chief is a member of the junior class and is director of the Glee Club. 1-le has been<br />\na member of the editorial staff since<br />\nhis sophomore year, and during that<br />\ntime, in addition to his regular duties, has served as managing editor,<br />\ndirecting the publication of several<br />\nissues of the paper. He has been<br />\none of the most active editors of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, and was considered eminently qualified to direct<br />\nits affairs during the remainder of<br />\nthis year and during his senior<br />\nyear. He is the son of Dr. Edward<br />\nIT. Spieker, associate professor of<br />\nGreek and Latin.<br />\nAt Thursday's meeting of the<br />\nBoard the'question of electing several new editors was discussed, and<br />\nit was decided to choose from<br />\namong- the twenty-five candidates<br />\nfive whose work stood highest in<br />\nquantity and quality. The staff,<br />\nhowever, wishes .it known that the<br />\nselection of the five men does not<br />\nindicate that there are no more positions to be filled.<br />\n, Later in the year several more<br />\nmen are to be selected from among<br />\nthe men who are already candidates<br />\nin addition to those who have recently reported themselves as interested in- the activity. The Board<br />\nwill probably elect five more editors<br />\nat the end of this academic year or<br />\nnext October, and invites all undergraduates to take part in the competition for the positions.

In the words<br />\nof Dr. Schouler, under whose foundation the Columbia professor will<br />\nspeak, he is \"a keen investigator,<br />\nbut somewhat inclining to levity in<br />\nhis conclusions.\"<br />\nDr. Dunning has been connected<br />\nwith Columbia during his whole<br />\nteaching life and has trained many<br />\nprominent historical students. He<br />\nis author of a number of authoritative books on political philosophy<br />\nand on the Civil War and Reconstruction, the latter being his historical hobby. He is a frequent<br />\ncontributor to the leading magazines, ranking high among political<br />\ncommentators. From 1894 to 1903,<br />\nDr. Dunning was managing editor<br />\nof the American Political Science<br />\nQuarterly, and in 1913 was president of the American Historical Association. He is at present Leiber<br />\nprofessor of history and political<br />\nphilosophy in Columbia.<br />\nThe lectures under the Schouler<br />\nFoundation in past years have numbered the most distinguished political students of the nation: President Lowell, of Harvard; Dr. John<br />\nBassett Moore, of Columbia; former Assistant Secretary of State,<br />\nJames Schouler; Dr. Josef Redlich,<br />\nthe distinguished Austrian economist; and Dr. Charles Francis Adams, the historian of the Civil War,<br />\nwho spoke here last year to audiences that filled McCoy Hall to the<br />\ndoors.<br />\nThe dates and subjects of Dr.<br />\nDunning's course are as follows:<br />\nMonday, January 25\u2014\"Conservative and Reactionary Doctrine.\"<br />\nTuesday, January 26\u2014 \"British<br />\nUtilitarianism.\"<br />\nMonday, February I\u2014\"The Philosophy of Constitutionalism.\"<br />\nTuesday, February \u2014\"The Philosophy of Nationalism.\"<br />\n<br />\nAlpha Lambda Chapter, Kappa<br />\nAlpha Fraternity, resumed active<br />\nexistence at Johns Hopkins with a<br />\nformal reinauguration at the Hotel<br />\nRennert, Saturday evening, January 16.

Upon<br />\nthis same field the Celts and Teutons struggled for the fertile valley<br />\nof the Rhine twenty centuries ago.<br />\nFrom Caesar's first conflict with<br />\nthe Helvetii in 58 B. C., Dr. Dennison traced his campaign up the<br />\nRhine, where, near Strassburg he<br />\nmet and defeated Ariovistus; thence<br />\ncrossing the Vosges Mountains, he<br />\ntold how Caesar overcame the Belgian host at the Aisne, and the<br />\nNervii at Manberge.<br />\nDr. Dennison also showed excellent views of Alesia, where in 52<br />\nB. C. the Gaulic army under Vercingetorix was shut up and starved<br />\ninto submission. Here Napoleon<br />\nIII erected a massive statue to the<br />\nfirst French national hero, and in<br />\nthe nearby town of Alise is one of<br />\nthe best collections of barbarian<br />\nrelics now existing.<br />\nHe also showed pictures of Roman<br />\nartillery and of Roman trenches discovered near this \"graveyard of<br />\nthe Gallic people.\"<br />\nBy the aid of excellent illustrations Caesar's campaigns were reenacted, and his \"Commentaries\"<br />\nvivified in a manner which is rarely<br />\naccomplished by the average teacher.<br />\n<br />\nThe independent swimming team<br />\nhas added another meet to its already pretentious schedule.

The announcement of the date and place was<br />\nfirst made last week to a representative of THE NEws-LETTER.<br />\nDetails for the installation exercises, however, have not been completed, and two plans of procedure<br />\nare under consideration. One idea<br />\nis to have the exercises out of doors<br />\non the lawn just west of the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering<br />\nBuilding. A great tent would be<br />\npitched upon this space, and accommodations for a couple of thousand people thus made. The speakers and guests of honor will be<br />\nseated on the portico of the engineering building. It is pointed out<br />\nthat the building would serve as<br />\nan excellent sounding board for the<br />\nvoices of the speakers.<br />\nThe other plan is to hold the exercises in machinery hall of the<br />\nengineering building. This hall is<br />\nin the form of a great L, and a<br />\nplaform erected at the angle could<br />\nbe seen by nearly two thousand<br />\npersons comfortably seated in the<br />\nwings.<br />\nThe occasion will have a double<br />\nsignificance, being not only the inauguration of the third president,<br />\nbut also the formal dedication of<br />\nthe Homewood Estate. The idea<br />\nof holding the exercises in the engineering building resulted from the<br />\ndesire to honor the State in some<br />\nmanner showing appreciation of the<br />\nassistance given in the establishment of the technical department.<br />\nAt all events, the occasion will be<br />\ndistinctly a Maryland affair, and it<br />\nIS said that if arrangements can<br />\nhe satisfactorily completed, the exercises will be held in the building<br />\nprovided by the State\u2014the engineering building.<br />\nA large number of invitations<br />\nwill be sent out, and the day' undoubtedly will be marked by the<br />\ngathering of some of the foremost<br />\neducators in the country.<br />\nAnother feature will be the<br />\nformal opening of the two new<br />\nbuildings at Homewood. After the<br />\nexercises the doors of the engineering building and of Gilman Hall<br />\nwill be thrown open, and visitors<br />\nwill be invited to inspect them. Gilman Hall is considered a \"model<br />\nlibrary building,\" and will undoubtedly attract a great deal of attention.<br />\nThe plans, ,however, are only<br />\ntentative, but both of the ideas will<br />\nbe notable for the manner in which<br /><br />\nThe annual interclass meet, held<br />\nin the cage last Saturday. was a<br />\nwalk-over for the sophomores, who<br />\npiled up a score of 64 points to 13.<br />\nWiggins and Mealy were the only<br />\npoint winners for the Class of 'i8:<br />\nthe former winning- the high jump<br />\n1 2 inches and taking<br />\nat 5 feet 2/<br />\nsecond place in the broad jump to<br />\nBinford, who won the event with<br />\na jump of 19 feet 2Y4 inches.<br />\nMealy surprised everybody by his<br />\npretty performance in the mile run.<br />\nTaking a considerable lead from<br />\nthe start, he maintained his advantage and finished a good 20 yards<br />\nahead of German, '17, in the fairly<br />\ngood time of 5 minutes 16 seconds.<br />\nBinford and Brooks were the<br />\nhigh point winners for the sophomores. By winning the broad jump,<br />\ntying for first in the quarter mile,<br />\ntaking second place in the 30-yard<br />\nluirdles and running third in the<br />\nwinning sophomore relay, Binford<br />\nPiled up 13 4 points. He also won<br />\nhis heat in the 30-yard dash, but a<br />\npoor start in the finals lost him a<br />\nplace in this event. Brooks won<br />\nthe shot put at 32 feet 1 inch and<br />\nalso took second place in the high<br />\njump and the 30-yard dash, making<br />\na total of ii points, while Jacobs<br />\ndid nearly as well by winning the<br />\n30-yard dash and the 30-yard hurdles. Ten sophomores in all were<br />\npoint winners.<br />\nThe senior-junior relay race was<br />\none of the most interesting events.<br />\nThe senior team, composed of<br />\nPrince, Voshell, Spencer and Merrick, won by a slight margin in the<br />\nvery good time of 2 minutes 30/5<br />\nseconds. Each man ran three laps<br />\nof the roo-yard track.<br />\nThe meet, as a whole, was rather<br />\nuninterestjng, both because it was<br />\nso one-sided and because no exceptional times were made. Jacobs<br />\nequaled the cage record in the 30yard dash (3', seconds), but no<br />\nother records were even approached.<br />\nThe soft condition of the track was<br />\nprobably partly responsible for this<br />\nfact, as also the lack of keen competition in many of the events. The<br />\ntrack had just been made over and<br />\nhad not had time to become at all<br />\nwell packed.<br />\nThe sophomore-freshman relay<br />\nevent resulted in an overwhelming<br />\nvictory for the '17 men.

Following the operation, the announcement was made<br />\nthat there is a slight chance for<br />\nhis recovery, this being almost the<br />\nfirst hope held out by attending<br />\nphysicians that the injured player<br />\nhad any real chance for victory in<br />\nhis brave fight to live.<br />\nThe operation was performed by<br />\nDr. William S. Baer, assisted by<br />\nfellow members of the Hopkins<br />\nstaff; Drs. Ronald T. Abercrombie,<br />\nJohn Staige Davis and J. V. Reed.<br />\nThe five physicians with Miss Bonner, a Johns Hopkins nurse, went<br />\nto Wilmington and began at noon<br />\nthe operation which lasted nearly<br />\ntwo hours. They discovered that<br />\nby removing the bones that were<br />\npressing down on the spinal cord,<br />\nthere is a faint hone that the cord<br />\nwould resume its former function.<br />\nThe cord itself was found to be<br />\nslightly contused.<br />\nIt was a most delicate operation,<br />\nand the physicians declare that Bob<br />\nhas still a long and hard road to<br />\ntravel before . ultimate recovery.<br />\nHowever, they say that the patient's<br />\ngrit and rare good fortune may pull<br />\nhim through.,<br />\nBob insisted that the operation be<br />\nperformed. His parents also appealed to Dr. Abercrombie, who last<br />\nWednesday went to Wilmington<br />\nand had a talk with his patient.. On<br />\nhis return he went into consultation<br />\nwith Dr. Baer and they decided to<br />\ntake the last chance to attempt to<br />\nsave the life of the player.<br />\nThe grit and determination displayed by Layfield since his injury<br />\nat South Bethlehem, Pa., on October 31 has alone given him a fighting chance for recovery. Since that<br />\ntime he has insisted that he would<br />\nsoon be well and able to play football again. In spite of sinking<br />\nspells, in one of which his temperature reached '66 -degrees, he has<br />\nfought, through several crises and<br />\nliow has a chance to live.

In the words<br />\nof Dr. Schouler, under whose foundation the Columbia professor will<br />\nspeak, he is \"a keen investigator,<br />\nbut somewhat inclining to levity in<br />\nhis conclusions.\"<br />\nDr. Dunning has been connected<br />\nwith Columbia during his whole<br />\nteaching life and has trained many<br />\nprominent historical students. He<br />\nis author of a number of authoritative books on political philosophy<br />\nand on the Civil War and Reconstruction, the latter being his historical hobby. He is a frequent<br />\ncontributor to the leading magazines, ranking high among political<br />\ncommentators. From 1894 to 1903,<br />\nDr. Dunning was managing editor<br />\nof the American Political Science<br />\nQuarterly, and in 1913 was president of the American Historical Association. He is at present Leiber<br />\nprofessor of history and political<br />\nphilosophy in Columbia.<br />\nThe lectures under the Schouler<br />\nFoundation in past years have numbered the most distinguished political students of the nation: President Lowell, of Harvard; Dr. John<br />\nBassett Moore, of Columbia; former Assistant Secretary of State,<br />\nJames Schouler; Dr. Josef Redlich,<br />\nthe distinguished Austrian economist; and Dr. Charles Francis Adams, the historian of the Civil War,<br />\nwho spoke here last year to audiences that filled McCoy Hall to the<br />\ndoors.<br />\nThe dates and subjects of Dr.<br />\nDunning's course are as follows:<br />\nMonday, January 25\u2014\"Conservative and Reactionary Doctrine.\"<br />\nTuesday, January 26\u2014 \"British<br />\nUtilitarianism.\"<br />\nMonday, February I\u2014\"The Philosophy of Constitutionalism.\"<br />\nTuesday, February \u2014\"The Philosophy of Nationalism.\"<br /><br />\nAlpha Lambda Chapter, Kappa<br />\nAlpha Fraternity, resumed active<br />\nexistence at Johns Hopkins with a<br />\nformal reinauguration at the Hotel<br />\nRennert, Saturday evening, January 16.
