President, Vice-President and Secretary.<br />\nThe Council was petitioned<br />\nby George Connolly who was<br />\nconcerned with the fairness of<br />\nthe proceedings. Discussion was<br />\nbased on principle, and vote<br />\ntallies in no way entered into the<br />\nbody's decision. Instead, the<br />\nCouncil was angered that several<br />\n<br />\nof its members were involved in<br />\nelectioneering around the ballot<br />\nboxes. Specifically the Student<br />\nCouncil was concerned with the<br />\nsignificant amount of politicking<br />\nrelative to the Office of Social<br />\nDirector that had gone on in the<br />\nvicinity of the ballot boxes--a<br />\nviolation of campaign rules. At<br />\nno time did the behavior of the<br />\ncandidates come into question.<br />\nSince no evidence was presented indicating any unfairness<br />\nin the other elections, the<br />\nrun-offs will be held as scheduled.

The controversy over<br />\nDr. Maccini's tenure recommendation fizzled,Merganthaler<br />\nHall nearly blew up, and the Student Council Social<br />\nDirector election did blow up. But the most tragic incident<br />\noccurred Tuesday when Goucher student Ruth Aaronson<br />\nwas struck by a car at the intersection of Charles and 34th<br />\nStreets.<br />\nFortunately, Ms. Aaronson's injuries appear not to be<br />\nlife-threatening or permanent. The sad part is, they could<br />\nhave been prevented entirely. Traffic patterns on Charles<br />\nSt. in the vicinity of the Hopkins campus arc horrendous.<br />\nNot only are pedestrians endangered; the street itself is<br />\nalso quite inconvenient for motorists.<br />\nAny time hundreds of people are forced several times a<br />\nday to cross a street on which cars consistently buzz along<br />\nat speeds of over 30 miles per hour, a significant potential<br />\nhazard is present. In this case, the worst specific problem<br />\nis the single south-bound lane of Charles St. which runs<br />\nadjacent to three north-bound lanes. Inevitably, people<br />\ncrossing from the Hopkins side look right before stepping<br />\ninto the street, but forget on occasion to check the southbound lane. Every Wolman Hall resident has done it at<br />\nleast once, probably without even knowing it. Most are<br />\nlucky, but the law of averages catches up, as it did Tuesday, and as it will again if conditions are not changed.<br />\nIf Baltimore was really a first-class city, as it claims to<br />\nbe with all its \"Baltimore Is Best\" propaganda, it would<br />\ninstall subterranean passageways across the Charles and<br />\n34th St. intersection and the one at Charles, 32nd, and Art<br />\nMuseum Drive, which is even more dangerous. London and<br />\nParis have numerous such walkways, but we would not<br />\npresume to expect Baltimore to be capable of matching<br />\ntheir class. There is, however, a more practicable alternative. \u2022 Charles St. should be made one-way northbound,<br />\nexcept for the service drive next to the campus.<br />\nThis move would at least prevent a repeat of the same<br />\nspecific misfortune which befell Ruth Aaronson. It would<br />\ndo little to worsen the already-bizarre traffic snarls, for the<br />\ncurrent southbound lane has very few functions which are<br />\nnot duplicated by the service drive. Its loss would do less<br />\nharm than continuing the risk of another blindside hit on a<br />\npedestrian which might end up putting someone out of<br />\naction permanently.<br />\n<br />\nAd Absurdum<br />\nWhoever heard of David Charney? A top Hopkins<br />\npolitical boss he ain't. In the past, he has been best<br />\nknown as a Jewish pre-med from Queens.

That candidates<br />\nfor three of the executive offices on the Council should<br />\nrun unopposed in itself indicates the ridicule in which the<br />\naugust body is held by Hopkins students.<br />\nGeorge Connolly has done a fine job this year as S.C.<br />\nPresident, about the best that could have been managed,<br />\ngiven the real weakness inherent in the position as exemplified by some of Connolly's recent predecessors.

Subsequent events have also shown<br />\ndemonstrable irresponsibility in<br />\nconducting election proceedings.<br />\nMy conclusion can only be that<br />\nsome members(perhaps a majority) of the Student Council do<br />\nnot have the proper perspective<br />\ntoward student government.<br />\nCouncil should be composed of<br />\npeople who are willing to work<br />\nfor students - even do garbage<br />\nwork. I feel that students must<br />\nseriously examine future candidates in an effort to minimize<br />\nincompetance and irresponsibility.<br />\nLet us review recent events,<br />\nso that my conclusions can be<br />\nplaced in context. Last week<br />\nthe Student Council by a vote of<br />\n11 - 7- I decided against extending<br />\ndeadlines for candidate petitions<br />\nand postponing elections by one<br />\nweek. The seven who voted to<br />\nextend the deadline (Bruce<br />\nSmith, Marshal Salant, Robert<br />\nElkin, Bill Carlson, Mike Myers,<br />\nSteve Richmond, and myself)<br />\ndid so in a belief that such an<br />\nextension would give students a<br />\ngreater opportunity to become<br />\ninformed and/or involved.<br />\n<br />\nI believe that the majority<br />\nof those who voted against<br />\nextending the deadline did so for<br />\nhighly selfish reasons. Many<br />\nobjected to the<br />\nextra work\"<br />\nthat this change would imply.<br />\nOthers were concerned with the<br />\npolitical implications of the<br />\nproposed change. These concerns ranged from the importance of maintaining deadlines<br />\nto an outright political concern<br />\nfor the announced candidates,<br />\nand its affect on campaigns.<br />\nThese attitudes, which I am sure<br />\ndo not fully reflect the views of<br />\nthose who voted against the<br />\nchange, were clearly important<br />\nin defeating the proposed<br />\nchange.<br />\nSince last Wednesday's regrettable decision further incidents point toward an irresponsible attitude in conducting this<br />\nelection.<br />\nSunday night was<br />\nsupposed to be the candidate's<br />\nforum. Since it received very<br />\nmarginal publicity, most students were unaware of it. One<br />\nnon-candidate attended. This is<br />\nindicative of the aversion toward<br />\nwork discussed above.<br />\nThe<br />\nCouncil goofed again.<br />\nThe election itself has been<br />\nquestionable. Vindictive poli-ticking has occurred regularly at<br />\nthe ballot boxes. This politicking has included those supposedly impartial ballot box workers.<br />\nDo these irresponsible actions mark the end or negate the<br />\npotential for good student gov-<br />\n<br />\nernment? I don't think so.<br />\nStudent Council reached its<br />\nnadir this week. The Council<br />\nhas been doing some good<br />\nthings, but it is clear that some<br />\n(perhaps a majority) on the<br />\nCouncil are not concerned with<br />\nfairness and increased student<br />\ninterest and involvement. This<br />\ncan only be changed by radically<br />\naltering the composition of the<br />\nCouncil. Every office should be<br />\nactively contested.<br />\nIf everyone becomes involved by running for office,<br />\nencouraging others, or by voting<br />\nfor those who are most apt to<br />\nwork constructively, Student<br />\nCouncil can grow. I realize that<br />\nthis will not create a perfect<br />\nsystem, but without more interest and concern Student Council<br />\nmay continue to conduct its<br />\naffairs as it did this past week.<br />\nThe Student Council has<br />\nbeen highly irresponsible in<br />\nproceeding with this election.<br />\nLittle concern has been demonstrated for increasing student<br />\nawareness and involvement. I<br />\ncall for anyone and everyone to<br />\nbecome active in improving<br />\nstudent government. Class elections are- at the end of the<br />\nmonth.

The President, freshly tanned on St.<br />\nCroix, began by outlining some<br />\nof his own responsibilities.<br />\n\"It's sometimes a little<br />\nstaggering to think about the<br />\nsize of what's involved here<br />\nbecause I serve both as President<br />\nof the University and the Hospital. There are 14,000 people on<br />\nthe combined payroll of those<br />\nI'm<br />\ninstitutions...Technically,<br />\nresponsible as President for what<br />\namounts to nearly half a billion<br />\ndollars of revenues and expenditures each year. The University<br />\nbudget is about $180 million.,<br />\nthe Hospital budget is about<br />\n$130 million., the APL budget is<br />\nabout $130 million...and that's<br />\ngoing up 9 or 10% each year<br />\nbecause of inflation alone...That<br />\nmeans that the total Johns<br />\nHopkins institutions are the size<br />\nof a pretty large corporation...It's a very large enterprise.\"<br />\nDr. Muller told the audience<br />\nthat he very rarely gets involved<br />\nin the day to day problems of<br />\nthe divisions, delegating that<br />\nresponsibility to deans and directors. I get involved other thing<br />\nI get involved in is planning,<br />\nlooking ahead, tryin to figure<br />\nout what to do next......<br />\n\"I'm very interested in the<br />\nHomewood Campus, I'm 'very<br />\ninterested in undergraduates, but<br />\nI have to give as much time to all<br />\nthe components of the University, plus the Hospital, as I do to<br />\nany other,\" said Dr. Muller, after<br />\nlisting his responsibility to<br />\nHomewood, East Baltimore,<br />\nApplied Physics Lab, School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies,<br />\npeabody,Evergreen<br />\nBologna,<br />\nHouse, and the Animal Farm.<br />\n\"This is now my eighth year in<br />\nthis crazy job.\"<br />\nDr. Muller then took questions from the audience. The<br />\nfollowing is an excerpted version<br />\nof the session which followed.<br />\n<br />\nHow would the janitors'<br />\nnight shift have saved $100,000?<br />\n<br />\n\"There may be a dispute<br />\nabout what's right and wrong,<br />\nbut there really isn't much<br />\nmystery about the fact that the<br />\neasiest and most efficient way to<br />\nclean a building is to have a team<br />\nof people go through it when it<br />\nis not in use. By team cleaning<br />\nwhen the campus is least in use<br />\nwe could do roughly the same<br />\ncleaning, have the same cleaning<br />\nefficiency with about ten fewer<br />\npeople, and ten fewer people<br />\nworks out to about $102,000.\"<br />\nWill there be more faculty<br />\ncuts?<br />\n\"We do not expect adiminstratively at Homewood to pursue any further cuts in the<br />\nfaculty. There are some new<br />\nappointments;there are also<br />\nsome people leaving. My expectation is the faculty will roughly<br />\nthe same in size next year as it is<br />\nthis year.\"<br />\nHow is the University reacting to fiscal pressures of inflation?<br />\n<br />\nengineering and we are very<br />\naggressively seeking more money<br />\nfor that. When things move to<br />\nthe point where we need to<br />\nmake a greater investment, the<br />\nprincipal thing we can do<br />\nis to try to find the new money<br />\nto do that. In the meantime,<br />\nmost of the other budgets, we<br />\nare trying to essentially keep as<br />\nthey are where we feel we can't<br />\nmake any cuts and then to make<br />\ncuts where we can. We are<br />\ntrying to make administrative<br />\ncuts first, support cuts second,<br />\nand academic cuts third, but it's<br />\nbeen very hard going.<br />\nHow will the Mellon Grants<br />\nbe spent?<br />\n\"They will be used for the<br />\npurposes for which they were<br />\ngiven.\" (The Mellon Foundation<br />\ndonated $300,000 for the development of the Core Curriculum,<br />\nand $750,000 for maintaining<br />\nmid-level<br />\nfaculty<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nHumanities.)<br />\nHow are you dealing with<br />\nmaintenance of the Library?<br />\n<br />\n\"We have been operating<br />\nwith a three year plan that<br />\ncalled for us to have about a $2<br />\nmillion deficit next year, and<br />\nthen be in balance in fiscal<br />\n'80-'81. That plan was made on<br />\nthe assumption that the rate of<br />\ninflation would be about 7%.<br />\nWell, the rate of inflation, in<br />\nfact, for 1978 turned oi4 to be<br />\n9%, which hurts. So we are in<br />\nthe process of some revisions in<br />\nthat plan. At that moment it<br />\nlooks as though our deficit for<br />\nnext year will certainly not be<br />\nbelow a million but it will be<br />\nsubstantially below this year,<br />\nand we still hope to be in<br />\nbalance by the year following<br />\nassuming that the rate of inflation does not really take off.<br />\nThe shortage of funds here has<br />\nbeen chronic and what we're<br />\ntrying to do is to expand only<br />\nwhen we can raise new funds.<br />\nFor example, the expansion in<br />\n<br />\n\"The Library is a desperate<br />\nproblem in two ways. First<br />\nof all the M.S.E. is just about<br />\nfull. The other problem is the<br />\nLibrary's acquisition budget<br />\nlhould be rising at a rate of<br />\nabout 14% a year just in order to<br />\nkeep up with the cost of books.<br />\nWe just have no_t been able to do<br />\nthat so what's happened is we're<br />\nbuying less new books then we<br />\nshould. In an ideal world we<br />\nwould be spending more on<br />\nlibrary acquisitions and we<br />\nwould expand the physical space<br />\nof the Library. We will do it, but<br />\nwe will do it in the way we hace<br />\nbeen doing other things; we will<br />\ndo it at a slower rate and later<br />\nthan we would like to. If this<br />\nUniversity were the only place<br />\nwhere that is happening, I think<br />\nwe would be very badly off, but<br />\nfor good or ill that's happening<br />\nall over the country. So in<br />\nrelative terms, actually Hopkins<br />\neingineering which we are pla- is at least as strong if not strongnning is based on the fact that er than most other institutions.\"<br />\nwe have already received some<br />\nnew money specifically for<br />\n<br />\nDo you support Director of<br />\nAdmissions Schnydman's efforts<br />\nto increase black student enrollment at Hopkins?<br />\n\"When I talked with Dean<br />\nHall and Mr. Schnydman, the<br />\nincrease in black enrollment is<br />\none of the priorities I asked him<br />\nto pursue.\"<br />\nWhy are dorm rooms as<br />\nexpensive as University apartments?<br />\n\"We have felt, and this has<br />\nbeen discussed with past Student<br />\nCouncils, that it is really fairer<br />\nto have a lottery system and<br />\ncharge everybody a uniform<br />\nrent, more or less. I think if<br />\nfreshmen paid a different rent<br />\nthan upperclassmen there would<br />\nbe a lot of resentment on the<br />\npart of the upperclassmen. I'm<br />\nglad I don't have to take responsibility for having been here<br />\nwhen those dorms were built.<br />\nThey could have been constructed with somewhat greater attention to little things like<br />\nsoundproofing.\"<br />\n<br />\nWill you be here in ten<br />\nyears9<br />\n1 have no contract. I serve<br />\nat the pleasure of the Board of<br />\nTrustees and I'm the one person<br />\nhere who can be fired literally<br />\novernight. And while no one has<br />\nrecently threatened me with<br />\nthat, one of my predecessors left<br />\nhere unexpectedly under conditions like that. I have no interest<br />\nin becoming President of any<br />\nother university. Given my<br />\ndruthers, I would like to be here<br />\nfor several years more. On the<br />\nother hand, you have to make a<br />\nresponsible judgment about how<br />\nlong you can do one job and<br />\nreally do it well. I don't think in<br />\nmy eighth year I'm at the<br />\npoint where I can no longer<br />\nmake a contribution. There's<br />\none other factor; I'm now 51. If<br />\nI stay here beyond 54 or 55 I<br />\nbecome almost unemployable. If<br />\nI'm suddenly asked to do<br />\nsomething else where I feel I<br />\ncould make a greater contribution, I would have to think<br />\nabout that. Something could<br />\ncome along which I would find<br />\nmore interesting. It will not be<br />\nanother university.<br />\n<br />\nOut there in the Atlantic Ocean on a sunshine beach<br />\nthere's going to be an outbreak of revelry this vacation<br />\nbreak.

Lately, however, I have been hounded<br />\nby a nightmare that a first-year Psychology major could<br />\ndecipher with little difficulty. In this nightmare, I am<br />\ndriving my car north on York Road. Twilight is falling,<br />\nthe streets are deserted, gas pumps cast monolithic<br />\nshadows in empty filling stations. My archaic Chevy<br />\nstarts to sputter. It breaks down and limps to a wounded stop in front of a burned-out Rustler Steak House.!<br />\ntry to get out of my car, but both doors are locked.<br />\nSuddenly everything goes black, as if someone had put<br />\nout the sun. Then I hear the footsteps...the dull echoing<br />\nthud of running feet, a stampede of sneakers, invisible,<br />\nunsyncopated, unrelenting...The light comes back on,<br />\nand I scream from the bottom of my lungs as a convoy<br />\nof joggers passes. While they run by, they pound the<br />\nroof of my car, grinning at me and singing, \"Macho,<br />\nmacho, macho man...\" That's when I wake up, my chest<br />\nheaving, my head soaking wet. My younger brother<br />\nstands over me with an empty Dixie Cup in his hand.<br />\n\"When warm weather comes,\" he tells me, \"you're<br />\nsleeping in the cellar.\"<br />\nThat gruesome dream has been responsible for my<br />\nlosing at least one night of sleep every month for the last<br />\nthree or four years. My brother talks of putting my bed<br />\nin the basement, while my parents have seriously discussed packing me off to the local Y. It's these damn<br />\njoggers (excuse me,they bust a gut unless you call them<br />\n\"runners\"). They're everywhere: uptown, downtown,<br />\non the streets, on television, in the magazines, evoy-<br />\n<br />\nwhere. They are legion, they are multiplying, and they<br />\nare driving me ga-ga.<br />\nWhy is it that, in the past few years, droves of<br />\nusually sane people have been donning Adidas and<br />\nsweatsuits, and subjecting themselves to long-distance<br />\ntorture? It's the thing to do, perhaps--a fad for fatties<br />\nand folks who fear fat. Like Disco and Pop Rocks,<br />\nrunning blots out boredom, or so I'm informed. To me,<br />\nrunning is boredom. Not only that, it is hazardous to<br />\none's health, despite what its proponents say.<br />\nTo prove this, let us take the case of a typical<br />\nrunner. Randall Rotund we'll call him. Randall is an<br />\ninsurance company claims adjuster who stands 5 feet 10<br />\ninches, and weights 185 pounds. You don't have to be<br />\nMarcus Welby to realize that Randall is one paunchy<br />\nclaims adjuster. In fact, his wife has told him so, and<br />\nhis boss has threatened to tie a can to Randall's grossly<br />\nobtruding tail unless the excess baggage gets dropped. So<br />\nRandall takes up jogging. He buys all the prescribed<br />\nparaphernalia--jogging shoes, sweatpants (with matching<br />\njacket), white socks, striped headband,jogging manual,<br />\njogging log book, and bumper stickers that say, \"I'd<br />\nrather be running.\" Now he's out sixty bucks. On his<br />\nfirst day of running, he rises at 5:30 a.m., two hours<br />\nearlier than usual. He stuffs himself into his jogging<br />\noutfit, forces down some Grape Nuts and a glass of<br />\nPerrier water, then starts out the front door and into the<br />\nstygian dawn with his eyes barely opened. After plodding for a half-mile, he feels a terrifying tightening in<br />\nhis side and chest. With a desperate yelp, he tumbles to<br />\nthe ground, rolling like a runaway beer keg into some<br />\nazalea bushes. No one finds him for weeks. His wife<br />\nremarries and hi\u00a7 boss hires a bright young claims<br />\nadjuster who resembles Anson Williams. Need I point<br />\nout the moral of this tragic tale?<br />\n<br />\nI'm starting to wonder whether my friends have<br />\nother perverse tendencies besides masochism. If they get<br />\na certain thrill out of it, I suppose that's fine. Even as<br />\nthey recount their physical agony in glorious detail, they<br />\nare apparently convinced that running benefits their<br />\ngeneral health. Ironically, they jog in a smoginfsted<br />\nmetropolis. Walking through Baltimore, especially during<br />\none of our hellish summer afternoons, is enough to<br />\nendanger one's physical well-being. People who run in<br />\nsuch conditions are flirting with suicide. They might as<br />\nwell take a quick hit off an exhaust pipe and save themselves the time and trouble ofjogging.<br />\n<br />\nIfl<br />\n<br />\nThe jogger sports a distinct air of superiority that fie<br />\nlikes to flaunt over the non-jogger. This condescending<br />\nattitude might best be summed up by the phrase, \"I'll<br />\nbet your calves aren't as firm as mine.\" Frankly, you can<br />\nkeep your firm calves. Whenever I see the scrawny<br />\nmuscular legs of a runner, I am reminded of scoops of<br />\npotato salad. I hate potato salad.<br />\nRunners like to brag, too. Male runners in particular<br />\nbona fide studs to<br />\nuse their status as<br />\nimpress members of the female persuasion. I remember<br />\nonce sitting at a party where some blond-haired hulk was<br />\nregaling several young ladies with his running exploits.<br />\nAllegedly, he ran \"fifteen miles a day, sometimes eighteen if I have the time.\" The girls were eating it up,<br />\nruffling his flaxen locks with their longing sighs. \"So<br />\nwhat,\" I interrupted, \"I'll bet he can't do this,\" whereupon I took a mighty swig of bitter lemon and gargled<br />\n\"The Theme from Shaft\" while juggling my hostess's<br />\nthree Chihuahuas. Nowadays if anyone from that party<br />\napproaches me on the street, he or she will do a quick<br />\nabout-face and duck inside the nearest building.<br />\nA popular and dangerous fallacy is that running<br />\nIv<br />\nmakes qne feel good. As one lady said to another at a<br />\nThe hucksters of America wasted little time in<br />\nTupperware party, \"That's a crock.\" Friends of mine<br />\nwho jog(and who may no longer be friends after reading milking the jogmania phenomenon for all that it's worth.<br />\nthis article) have admitted to the thundering pain that The word was passed down from Madison Avenue: no<br />\naccompanies running. Yet they confess it gives them runner is a real runner unless he is wearing an authentic,<br />\ntremendous pleasure. I'm boggled when I hear them honest-to-God, nylon acrylic sweatsuit (a bright color<br />\ndiscussing their jogging pains, or \"physical highs,\" as and the racing lines on the sides of the legs are standard<br />\nfeatures, while glow-in-the-dark stripes and the words<br />\nthey call them.<br />\n\"Oh, man, after ten miles, it's like your body is \"Gonna Fly Now\" emblazoned on the back are extras).<br />\nThe ancient Greeks were excellent athletes, and, it must<br />\nnothing but one big hurt,\"one will say.,<br />\n\"Yeah, yeah, but you just feel like going on,\" be noted, they used to run around in the buff. They may<br />\nanother remarks, \"just to see if you can break the wall not have gotten much jogging in, particularly when a<br />\ncold snap hit; the point is they never succumbed to the<br />\nof pain.\"<br />\nnotion that wearing acrylic outfits made them better<br />\nAvenue<br />\nWalker<br />\non<br />\nhill<br />\nthis<br />\nrunning<br />\nup<br />\n\"I was<br />\nthe other day...closest thing to death I've ever experie- runners.<br />\nThen came the books\u2014The Runner's Manual,<br />\nnced.

It's quite a rush.\" comes complete with a \"Running Commentary,\" in<br />\nwhich the runner notates how far he ran on a particular<br />\n\"You said it.\"<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\n\fday, how long he took, how he felt, what he thought,<br />\nand what he saw.<br />\nThe Runner's Almanac also includes recipes with<br />\nrepulsively cute names like, \"Jog Juice,\" \"Sprinter's<br />\nSpuds,\" 'Feelin' Stronger Stroganoff,\" \"Marathon<br />\nMushrooms,\" \"Soupe du Jogger,\" and, \"Gotta Run<br />\nBreakfast.\" I've concocted a few of my own jogger<br />\nrecipes which I might submit to the editors of The<br />\nRunner's Almanac. How about \"Dull Throbbing Pain<br />\nPancakes,\"Stroke Stringbeans,\"\" Heart Attack Ham,\"<br />\n\"Loss of Breath Broccoli,\" \"Strained Tendon Tomato<br />\nJuice,\" and \"Blackout Barbeque\"?<br />\nThe running motif has been very vis ible on network<br />\ntelevision. We have had a Cheerios commercial where an<br />\nentire family scarf down about a half-dozen bowls of<br />\nCheerios, and then jog off together into the sunset<br />\n(apparently in search of a public john);and a Pabst Blue<br />\nRibbon commercial where the winner of a marathon,<br />\nobviously not feeling any of the effects ofjust having<br />\nrun 26 miles, relaxes right after the race with a group of<br />\nhis ecstatically cheering friends and a mug of frosty<br />\nbrew. There are other commercials of this ilk, but lack<br />\nof space and a weak stomach prohibit me from listing all<br />\nof them.<br />\nHowever, as in the case of the running recipes, I've<br />\ncome up with some original running-related TV commercials. For instance, here's one for Exxon: the scene<br />\nis a typical American avenue at morning rush hour,<br />\nexcept that there are no cars, just people running with<br />\nbrief cases and shopping bags and so forth. A concerned<br />\nvoice-over says,\"America, you've been pigging out on<br />\nthe world's oil reserves for too long. And unless you<br />\nstart conserving gasoline, rush hour will soon look like<br />\nthis.\" Or, how about this commercial for Keds All-Stars:<br />\na man wearing a pair of Keds is walking down a dark<br />\nalley near the docks, when suddenly two thugs jump out<br />\nat him. He starts to run while his assailants pursue,<br />\nand a gravelly voice-over asks, \"What would you say the<br />\nodds are of this man's escaping and living to tell the<br />\ntale? Slim, you say? Well, think again, because he's<br />\nwearing Keds All-Stars. Keds' suction-cup soles provide<br />\ntop gripping action, even on slippery back alley cobblestones.\" Anyway, those are some of my ideas. If any of<br />\nyou have similar suggestions, then by all means keep<br />\nthem to yourselves.<br />\nPerhaps the most outrageous jogging-related ad I<br />\nhave encountered is the one for Formfit Roger's Running Bra. When I first heard about this \"running bra,\" I<br />\ndeduced it must have had legs. I wondered why any<br />\nwoman would want to own a bra that was always<br />\nscooting away from her. Finally, I decided that the<br />\n\"running bra\" was invented to keep a woman company<br />\nwhenever she had to jog alone. I pictured the little<br />\nbugger (with its tiny unmentionable legs) scampering<br />\nalongside its owner, a loyal companion to the end, a<br />\nB-cup buddy after countless washings. Eventually, I was<br />\nput wise. I saw the ad for the Running Bra, which was<br />\n\"designed specifically to minimize bounce...\" This bit of<br />\nbad news serves a cruel blow to the guys who run for the<br />\nexpress purpose of watching. female joggers jiggle by.<br />\nLast week a Baltimore housewife wrote in the Sun<br />\nMagazine of her plans to form a club for \"running<br />\nwidows ,\" women whose husbands spend more and<br />\nmore time jogging, and less and less time around the<br />\nhouse.

Jogmania is breaking up the<br />\nhome. And how do Americans respond to this problem?<br />\nWell, they're certainly not taking it lying down. That's<br />\njust it; if they would lie down for just alittle while, then<br />\nthis crisis could be averted. Instead they run on like jolly<br />\nidiots, basking in the pleasant agony of their shin splints.<br />\nSurely by now some of our more thinskinned<br />\nreaders are already mentally composing their vehement<br />\nletters to the editor. I can just hear them: \"Where does<br />\nthis clown get off knocking something as pure and<br />\nwondrous as running? I'll bet the guy never went running once in his life! Leave it to you scumbags at the<br />\nNews-Letter to come up with such vile and vicious<br />\ngarbage!\" Actually, I must confess (with great shame)<br />\nthat I did once take a stab at running.

I thought<br />\njogging was it. What did I know, I was just a dumb kid.<br />\nI made the lone jog of my lifetime on a chilly<br />\nautumn afternoon. I put on my Jack Purcells, a pair of<br />\nblue jeans, several sweaters, and my Oriole cap. I looked<br />\nlike Beaver Cleaver. After telling my mother that I was<br />\nstepping out, but would return red-cheeked and well on<br />\nthe way to Stud City, I burst out the front door and<br />\nproceeded at a steady clop-clop-clop down the street.<br />\nFor the first five minutes, I felt pretty good. My<br />\nbreathing was regular, my head was clear, all systems<br />\nwere go. That is, they seemed go. At the sixth or seventh<br />\nminute, a searing pain gripped my left side. Tears came<br />\nto my eyes as I doubled over. It felt as though the Grim<br />\nReaper himself had fastened his boney claws around my<br />\nneck and rocked his knee into my groin. I got down<br />\non all fours and began moaning like a cow in labor.<br />\nRaising my head, I saw a school bus go by, and framed<br />\nin each window was a laughing face; the-derisive cackling<br />\nof those flint-hearted children bounced around in my<br />\nbrain, and right then and there I more or less decided<br />\nthat I would never again go running.<br />\nVI<br />\nI originally thought that writing this article might<br />\nserve as a kind of catharsis, purging me of my hostility<br />\ntowards jogging (oops, I mean \"running\"). But I'm<br />\nafraid it hasn't. By delineating some of the reasons for<br />\nthat hostility, I feel that I have only stoked the fire that<br />\npowers it. Call it a pet peeve, an eccentricity, a defect.<br />\nAdmittedly it reflects a certain corruptness on my part.<br />\nNevertheless, I find it virtually impossible to control(for<br />\nexample, when I'm driving and trying to maneuver my<br />\ncar around a gaggle ofjoggers who are taking up half the<br />\nroad).<br />\nAlas, poor runner, and beware! If you should be<br />\njogging somewhere in these environs and you happen to<br />\nlook over your shoulder and see a gold Chevy Nova hot<br />\non your heels, you'd best burn some rubber, son, or else<br />\nsay your prayers. Chances are you'll get left lying<br />\nin the dust; and when youllook up to glimpse the cause<br />\nof your demise, you might read the bumper sticker on<br />\nthe back of my car, which states)<br />\n\"NO, ACTUALLY, I'D<br />\nRATHER NOT BE RUNNING.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 I MARCH 9, 1979<br />\n<br />\nTopical Tabloid Tidbits!!!<br />\nBroncos Show<br />\nTheir Asses:<br />\nKeester Kanceled<br />\n<br />\nstereotypes associated with sports may ultimately have a<br />\ngreater effect on men than on women. \"Historically,<br />\nthere have been many more barriers against male participation in sports thought to be feminine.

Along with masculine<br />\nand feminine, this test characterizes subjects according<br />\nto androgynous and undifferentiated. Androgynous<br />\nrefers to people who score high in both masculine and<br />\nfeminine traits, and undifferentiated refers to those who<br />\nscore low in both.<br />\nThe results: most female athletes were androgynous, and those who were androgynous tended to have<br />\nthe highest self-esteem of all the students tested. \"What<br />\nthis means,\" Harris said, \"is that many of the female<br />\nathletes had characteristics, such as the desire to work<br />\nhard and excel, that should be desirable for anyone,<br />\nregardless of gender.\"<br />\nHarris thinks the current move away from gender<br />\n<br />\nsimple as that.\"<br />\nRonnie Alexander, one of the original co-plaintiffs<br />\nin the case, more charitably speculated that \"Yale took<br />\nan extreme position right in the beginning, and has to<br />\nkeep up that profile.\"<br />\nWhile Yale officials and attorneys withheld out-of-court comment until the case is resolved, Price's allies in<br />\nthe courtroom evinced some worry that Yale's \"extreme<br />\nposition\" might have worked.<br />\nOne young woman, who,as the wife of a member of<br />\nYale attorney William Doyle's law firm, described herself<br />\nas \"a friend of the enemy,\" opined that \"sexual politics...shouldn't be decided in the courts.\" Nevertheless,<br />\n\"I think this is a really important problem, but this isn't<br />\nthe (right) case.

The courtroom was jammed with law students,<br />\npolitical activists, housewives, administrators, alumni,<br />\nthe press and students--mostly women\u2014who filtered in<br />\nand out during the two days of testimony. In the hall<br />\noutside, though, the talk among the observers was<br />\nmostly about the mechanics of Yale's defense, and,<br />\nultimately, about why Yale was going to such lengths.<br />\nIf the University is found guilty of allowing and<br />\nfailing to provide adequate procedures for remedying<br />\nsexual harrassment, it stands to lose all of its federal<br />\nassistance. If Price wins, the school will have to set up a<br />\ngrievance procedure. Why, then, is Yale pursuing this<br />\nsuit so aggressively in the face of such stakes?<br />\n\"Male ego,\" explains one alumnus. The man with<br />\nher, also a Yalie, elaborated harshly: \"You've got to<br />\nremember that this place was all-male for 269 years, and<br />\nwomen were brought in largely to satisfy the sexual<br />\ndesires of Yale men.

College students not only want to see Animal<br />\nHouse (they've helped it make over $17 million thus<br />\nfar), they want to BE Animal House. Food fights, in<br />\nshort, are becoming very popular again.<br />\nIt all started when Universal Studios and National<br />\nLampoon put on a dozen promotional toga parties at<br />\nvarious universities. Then other college unions took up<br />\nthe idea, and threw their own campus toga parties-complete with unlimited quantities of beer,jello eating<br />\ncontests, and John Belushi look-alike contests--all against<br />\nthe background of \"Louis, Louie,\" with unexpurgated<br />\nlyrics.<br />\nAlthough there seems to be an upsurge in Animal<br />\nHouse-type behavior (Kent State officials, for example,<br />\nwere compelled to warn dorm residents that<br />\nHouse-inspired noises and drinking violations would<br />\nresult in dreaded \"white slips\"), the movie's most<br />\npopular legacy appears to be the traditional food fight.<br />\nAt Texas A&M,a dining hall food fight caused $900<br />\nin damages, and prompted the resignation of three food<br />\nservice employees. Eight students were expelled from<br />\nthe board program, recounts food services director Ron<br />\nBlatchely, but not before students began asking for<br />\ntransfers to other dining facilities.<br />\nSo far, Blatchely says, food fight action has been<br />\ncontained, but hard-core food fight devotees have found<br />\nother ways to express themselves.

In the past few years, the<br />\nintellectual insight and vision of these<br />\ndirectors into the aesthetic, moral and<br />\npolitical foundations of Western civilisation has made an enormous impact in<br />\ncinematic circles. The two most prolific<br />\nfilmmakers in this movement are Rainer<br />\nWerner Fassbinder and Werner Herzog.<br />\nThe interest in these two brilliant directors is indicated by the numerous showings of their films in Baltimore this year.<br />\nOn Friday the Maryland Institute of Art<br />\nwill present Herzog's La Soufriere (1977)<br />\nand Fassbinder's Why Does Herr R. Run<br />\nAmok? (1969). This opportunity to see<br />\nfilms by the most important contemporary filmmakers should not be missed.<br />\nLa Soufriere is only a 30-minute<br />\ndocumentary, but undeniably is one of<br />\nHerzog's major works. Guadeloupe was<br />\nevacuated because of an imminent<br />\nvolcano which would destroy the island,<br />\nbut there was one man who refused to<br />\nleave. Learning this, Herzog and a small<br />\ncrew flew to this deserted island and<br />\nfilmed it in anticipation of a catastrophe<br />\nwhich never came to pass. La Soufriere is<br />\na vision of a world poised on the edge of<br />\nan apocalypse,\"an extraordinary work of<br />\npersonal reportage...perhaps the truest<br />\npicture of the tempestuous yearning that<br />\nHerzog has invested on all his films,\"<br />\naccording to Tom Allen of the Village<br />\nVoice.<br />\nWhy Does Herr R. Run Amok? is a<br />\nwell-known film about'a normal, likable<br />\n<br />\nguy who develops into a mass-murderer.<br />\nWe become acquainted with his ordinary,<br />\njust-folks lifestyle, meeting his family,<br />\nfriends, job and idle chit-chat. One<br />\nevening, though, Herr R. calmly picks up<br />\nan ornate lamp and kills his wife, child<br />\nand a neighbor. The film records the<br />\ndestruction of his life as the film builds<br />\nand infernal despair and unbearable<br />\ntension, and Herr. R.'s act almost becomes logical.<br />\nJean-Luc Godard is one of the most<br />\nintellectual and controversial post-war<br />\nfilmmakers, and arguably the greatest.<br />\nFirst a film critic, Godard's theories have<br />\nhad enormous power over the changing<br />\naesthetic, sociological and political preoccupations of New Wave filmmaking in<br />\nFrance. Godard changed the intentions<br />\nof his craft by converting it into an<br />\nintimate game between himself and his<br />\naudience. His films have become an<br />\napplication of these principles.<br />\nIn his games, Godard makes the rules<br />\nas he goes along, allowing himself outrageous freedom in his technique, style,<br />\nstructure and narrative.<br />\nProfoundly<br />\naware of the power of the film images, he<br />\nhas shifted emphasis from the image to<br />\nthe mind that created it. Films imply<br />\nsomething about their maker, and Godard<br />\ntakes up the role of commentator on<br />\nhimself, his audience, and the cultural<br />\nrelationships between the two. He strips<br />\nthe film image of all its emotional content and shows the audience how readily<br />\nit can be cheated into accepting the<br />\nrhetoric of the filmmaker. Godard<br />\ndoesn't hypnotize his audience with his<br />\nimages, but confronts them with ques-<br />\n<br />\napplication of his theories, Breathless was<br />\nthe beginning of Godard's Cinematic<br />\nrevolution.<br />\nSome contend that Weekend is his<br />\nfarewell to \"commercial cinema.\" It is a<br />\nsavage eruption against Gaullist France as<br />\nGodard sets the audience up for a denunciation of the French bourgeoisie, only to<br />\nundermine this apparent satire with<br />\ndevastating scenes of carnage and destruction. A married couple decides to go on a<br />\nweekend outing with the purpose of<br />\nmurdering the wife's parents for an<br />\ninheritance. Their trip is interrupted by a<br />\nhellish landscape of burning cars and<br />\nmutilated bodies. These scenes, both<br />\nabsurd and visually disturbing, make<br />\nWeekend a most brutal film.<br />\nFrench_ film aesthetician Andre<br />\nBazin, whose theories had great influence<br />\non Godard and other New Wave filmmakers, said of Orson Welles' Citizen<br />\nKane that it \"can never be too highly<br />\npraised. Thanks to the depth of field,<br />\nwhole scenes are covered in one take, the<br />\ncamera remaining motionless. Dramatic<br />\neffects for which we had formerly relied<br />\non montage were created out of the<br />\nmovements of the actors within a fixed<br />\nA scene from Godard's Breathless<br />\nframework.\" Bazin praised this classic<br />\ntions about the very nature of the image film because it allowed the audience<br />\nnew<br />\nitself.<br />\nfreedoms in interpreting the cinematic<br />\nThe Reel World will be showing two image.

Jerome Kilty has incorporated<br />\nmany choice letters and some recorded<br />\nconversations into a fascinating portrayal<br />\nof the relationship between a leading<br />\nactress of the time and a leading playwright of all time.<br />\nIn the early 1900's, when he was<br />\n\"old enough to know better,\" Shaw fell<br />\nhead over heels in love with Mrs. Campbell. Campbell was not the only woman<br />\nShaw fell in love with during his married<br />\nyears, but the \"Stella-Joey\" relationship<br />\nwas one of his more famous affairs. Shaw<br />\nwrote Pygmalion. for Campbell, and he<br />\nwaited a long time for her to be ready to<br />\nplay it.<br />\n<br />\nThe letters written by Shaw and<br />\nCampbell were very dear to both of them,<br />\nand they exchanged hands several times.<br />\nIn the 1930's, when Campbell was in<br />\nfinancial trouble, Shaw sent her his letters<br />\nso that she might sell the collection if she<br />\nhad to. The letters were not sold during<br />\nCampbell's lifetime, although they were<br />\nalmost destroyed during World War II.<br />\nDear Liar is a love story told in the<br />\nparticipants' own words, wittily and,<br />\nsometimes, painfully.

Several banners, one from 98<br />\nRock, declared that \"Disco Sucks.\"<br />\nApparently, this anti-disco reaction is<br />\nspreading across the country. At the<br />\nbeginning of the concert, Angel was<br />\ncheered when it proclaimed, \"I have one<br />\nthing to tell you, Baltimore: Disco<br />\nSucks!\"<br />\nEd. note: This anti-disco sentiment is<br />\nby no means universal. For the prodisco viewpoint, please turn to Paul<br />\nBerchielli's letter on Page 3.<br />\n<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nCombining spectacular lighting effects with spirited renditions of its latest<br />\nhits, Styx held the Civic Center audience<br />\nspellbound with its grand illusion.<br />\nAngel served as Styx's warm-up<br />\ngroup, a role it has become accustomed<br />\nto by now. Angel offers three things: its<br />\nmusic breaks the sound barrier; its lead<br />\nguitarist performs gymnastic feats with<br />\nhis microphone; and it possesses a keyboard guitar that shrieks. Though my<br />\nbrother told me that Angel is not as bad<br />\nthe second time, I plan to be an hour late<br />\nfor my next Styx concert.<br />\nStyx took 45 minutes to set up, but<br />\nits performance was well worth the wait.<br />\nUnlike Kiss, Styx's make-up is not on its<br />\nmembers'faces but on the stage. To<br />\n\" clarify, Styx's special lighting effects are<br />\nnothing short of amazing; if the group<br />\never tires of rock 'n' roll, it could easily<br />\nsucceed in the magic business. A Styx<br />\nconcert features silkscreens of the covers<br />\nof its two most recent albums, Grand<br />\nIllusion and Pieces of Eight, and another<br />\nof a moving sea that is the background<br />\nfor \" Sailing Away.\" Styx's act also<br />\nincludes exploding dry ice (perhaps this is<br />\na commonplace) and, more interestingly,<br />\n\u2022a hanging kaleidoscope ball that projects<br />\nstars onto a background that changes<br />\ncolors and, for the finale, spidery astral<br />\nprojections. These lighting effects received as much applause as the music, if not<br />\nmore.<br />\nFor the most part, Styx played songs<br />\nfrom its two most recent albums: \"Great<br />\nWhite Hope,\" \"I'm OK,\" \"Grand<br />\nIllusion,\" \"Fooling Yourself,\" \"Queen of<br />\nSpades,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Lady,\" \"Blue<br />\nCollar Man,\" \"Come Sail Away\" and<br />\n\"Miss America.\" It also performed<br />\n\"Sweet\" from its 1975 Equinox album.<br />\n'Though Styx was nearly as loud as Angel,<br />\nit retained a gentle quality in its music by<br />\nmeans of an organ, a twelve-string guitar<br />\nand a quasi-folk solo on the guitar. Styx<br />\nplayed this concert fairly straight, but it<br />\nwent wild during the rendition of its<br />\ncurrent hit single, \"Renegade.\" Following a long drum solo, after which the<br />\ndrummer had the audience shout \"Toga,<br />\nToga,\" the guitarist re-entered and began<br />\nrunning back and forth across the stage.<br />\nDuring the encore, Dennis DeYoung, the<br />\nkeyboard player and one of the vocalists,<br />\nwalked onto the stage in a white surgical<br />\ncoat and began a Mick Jagger imitation<br />\nof \"I Don't Get No Satisfaction.\"<br />\nThe crowd was dull, though several<br />\nsecurity guards (one of them sported a<br />\n\"mohawk\" haircut) dragged away several<br />\nfighting spectators kicking and screaming.<br />\nAn interesting item was available to<br />\nthose who could read the handwriting on<br />\n<br />\nHarold<br />\nMaude<br />\ncont. from p. 17<br />\ndating service. Harold cleverly scares the<br />\ntacky computer dates away with apparent<br />\nself-mutilations.<br />\nThe scenes of Harold with his dates<br />\nare juxtaposed with scenes of Harold with<br />\nMaude. In these scenes Maude ceaselessly<br />\nexpounds on personal liberty, living life<br />\nto the fullest, individualism, nonconformity and rebellion. Harold realizes that<br />\nhe has not lived. Ruth Gordon delivers<br />\nthese monologues with such charm that<br />\nthe audience does not feel the uncomfortableness usually experienced when a<br />\ncharacter in a movie expounds on life.<br />\nThe absurdity of Harold's theatrics<br />\nmixes with Maude's outrageous radicalism<br />\nto produce a highly entertaining film.<br />\nAlthough the ending (which I will not<br />\nreveal) is sudden and unsettling, the film<br />\nhas subtly prepared the audience for it.<br />\nEarly Cat Stevens songs (Tea for the<br />\nTillerman, Mona Bone Jakon) appropriately accompany the film.<br />\n<br />\nWeber Lacks Star Quality<br />\nBY DEVRA SIROT<br />\nFrank Weber has never played with<br />\nLinda Ronstadt or the Rolling Stones.<br />\nHe's never been produced by Richard<br />\nParry or backed by Stevie Nicks. And<br />\nno wonder. The concert Wednesday night<br />\nin Shriver Hall auditorium was entertaining and novel at times, but Weber lacks<br />\nstar quality.<br />\nCompared to the opening act, Roger<br />\nHernandez, Weber's voice and keyboard<br />\nplaying were excellent. Weber opened<br />\nwith a biographical song, \"71,\" from<br />\n<br />\nhis first (and only) album, entitled As the<br />\nTime Flies., The lyrics were innovative<br />\nbut sometimes sounded fragmented. With<br />\n\"Complicated Times,\" a fast-paced tune<br />\nreminiscent of Billy Joel, the band took<br />\noff into instrumentals. The band picked<br />\nup on Frank Elmo's saxophone jazz-rock<br />\nbeat.<br />\nThough the lyrics to \"Regina\" seem<br />\nsentimental and mediocre when read, the<br />\n,rhythmic congo beat and disco quality<br />\nof the music saved the songs. Armen<br />\nHalburian, the percussionist, did an<br />\nexcellent job with bar chimes and<br />\n<br />\nBrazilian bells.<br />\nHalburian, Elmo and Rontiero on<br />\ndrums livened up the crowd with Nat<br />\nKing Cole's \" Straighten Up and Fly<br />\nRight.\" \" Straighten Up and Fly Right.\"<br />\nThat and a jazzed-up version of \"Take It<br />\nto the Limit\" were the best jazz work<br />\nof the evening. But \"Wait Until Tomorrow Show,\" about soap operas, was more<br />\nentertaining. One verse went like this:<br />\n\"Pete's got Nancy into bondage and<br />\nwhips/He puts a blindfold on her,/ an0<br />\nwatches as she walks around the room<br />\nand strips.\"<br />\n<br />\nArt Explorations<br />\nExplorations at the Walters, sponsored by grants from the National<br />\nEndowment for the Humanities, offers a<br />\ndiverse program of slide-lectures, films<br />\nand music at the Walters Art Gallery.<br />\nThree lecture series are all- held .on<br />\nThursdays at 8 p.m: \"Africa: the Seductive Lover,\" which will \"explore the<br />\nintimate relationships of the arts and life<br />\nin African aesthetic and social interactions;\" \"The Voice of the Bamboo: The<br />\nArt of China and Japan,\" which will<br />\n\"examine the mysticism and symbolism<br />\nof Oriental thought in art and the<br />\nexquisite arts of scroll painting, prints<br />\nand porcelain;\" and \"Angles of Vision,\"<br />\nwhich \"offers a wide variety of approachThe Walters' Treasures of Cyprug exhibit - es, designed to increase\" one's ability to<br />\nbegins March 25.<br />\nrespond to a work of art emotionally,<br />\n<br />\naesthetically, intellectually, and sensually.<br />\nAll three series begin on February 15.<br />\n\"Africa: the Seductive Lover\" continues<br />\nuntil April 19; the other two end on May<br />\n3.<br />\nThe Walters also offers concerts by<br />\nPro Musica Rara every other Sunday from<br />\nFebruary 25 to May 6 at 3 p.m. in the<br />\nRennaissance-style Main Court.

In<br />\naddition, there are a number of<br />\npromising first-year players<br />\nwho undoubtedly will contribute to the team's success.<br />\nDefensively, a highly recruited goalie named Wiley<br />\nKidd will be competing for<br />\nthe back-up spot behind junior<br />\nMike Federico. Another defenseman, Dave Black from<br />\nCalvert Hall, is expected to<br />\nsee considerable playing time<br />\nalong with returnees Mark<br />\nGreenberg, Curt Ahrendsen,<br />\nLeRoy Katz and Mike Sheedy.<br />\nIn the midfield Joe Ciletti<br />\nfrom Calvert Hall, Gil Cruz<br />\nfrom Sewanhaka, and Craig<br />\nCook from Boy.s' Latin have<br />\nlooked impressive in practice.<br />\nKirk Baugher from Manhasset,<br />\nwhose older brother Scott was<br />\na first-team All-American last<br />\nyear, is also expected to secure<br />\na spot on the varsity.<br />\nPlaying attack this year<br />\nwill be Jeff Cook (Craig's<br />\nbrother) from McDonough,<br />\n<br />\nwill insert its six best offensive<br />\nplayers into the line-up, while<br />\nthe opposing team will put in<br />\nits best six defensive players<br />\nregardless of position.<br />\nSuch strategy may neutralize some of Hopkins' depth in<br />\nthe midfield position, which<br />\nincludes co-captains Steve Wey<br />\nand Dave Huntley, Bob<br />\nTeasedale, Baugher, Garavente,<br />\nFederico and Radebaugh, and<br />\nproduce more two platoon<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nFurthermore, the new rule<br />\nwill practically eliminate the<br />\npossibility of thrilling comebacks in the final minutes of a<br />\ngame such as that which<br />\noccurred in Hopkins' 21-20<br />\ntriumph over Maryland two<br />\nyears ago at College Park.<br />\nOn that occasion the Blue<br />\nJays were trailing by a score of<br />\n20-18 with just 1:54 left in the<br />\ngame.

However, unanimous consent is required to close a meeting, and<br />\nthe objections of Council members Bruce Smith and Cindy<br />\nSimon kept the meeting public.<br />\nConnolly explained that<br />\ncampaigning had taken place<br />\nnear ballot boxes, that Council<br />\nmembers and students staffing<br />\nballot boxes had not properly<br />\nchecked voters' identification,<br />\nand that Council members were<br />\ndiscussing candidates with the<br />\nvoters.<br />\nIn addition, Connolly overheard one student saying he had<br />\nvoted 11 times.<br />\nConnolly stressed that \"the<br />\ncandidates themselves were not<br />\ninvolved.\" Rather, it was negligence on the part of the Council<br />\nand its ballot box staffers which<br />\ncaused the problems.<br />\nConnolly repeatedly stated<br />\nthat the Social Directorship<br />\ncontest should be voided. The<br />\nCouncil voted 12 to 5 to invalidate that race.. Members who<br />\nvoted in favor of invalidation<br />\nwere George Connolly, Cindy<br />\nSimon, Robert Fink, Karen<br />\nLoebel, Harry Lerner, Tom<br />\nMessana, Marshal Salant, Robert<br />\nElkin, Steve Mandelberg, Mike<br />\nMyers, Michael Wallk and Steve<br />\nRichmond. Those who voted<br />\nagainst invalidation were Bill<br />\nCarlson, Monroe Zeffert, Mike<br />\nKrochak, Scott Wolfe and Rich<br />\nLevy.<br />\nThe Council also approved a<br /><br />\nmotion whereby the candidates<br />\nfor Social Director, Amy Caplan<br />\nand Steve Yandell, will be<br />\nreimbursed for the cost of their<br />\nadvertising in the original elec\u2014<br />\ntion. Connolly suggested this<br />\nbecause Student Council errors<br />\nnecessitated that the election be<br />\nheld again.<br />\nThe Council decided to<br />\nabide by the results of the<br />\ntreasurer's race - because, in<br />\nConnolly's words, \"As far as I<br />\ncan tell, the treasurer's race was<br />\nreasonably legitimate...I'm not<br />\n_sure at this time that any significant politicking went on (for<br />\nthat office).\"<br /><br />\nAnalyses, chaired by Connolly,<br />\nwill survey student opinion.<br />\nQuestionnaires consisting of 15<br />\ngeneral questions plus additional<br />\nquestions pertaining to the student's major, will be distributed<br />\nby this group, probably starting<br />\nMonday.

One such issue<br />\nto be studied is class bunching,<br />\nthe phenomenon whereby several classes are offered simultaneously, preventing many students from enrolling in preferred<br />\ncourses because of time conflicts.

President, Vice-President and Secretary.<br />\nThe Council was petitioned<br />\nby George Connolly who was<br />\nconcerned with the fairness of<br />\nthe proceedings. Discussion was<br />\nbased on principle, and vote<br />\ntallies in no way entered into the<br />\nbody's decision. Instead, the<br />\nCouncil was angered that several<br /><br />\nof its members were involved in<br />\nelectioneering around the ballot<br />\nboxes. Specifically the Student<br />\nCouncil was concerned with the<br />\nsignificant amount of politicking<br />\nrelative to the Office of Social<br />\nDirector that had gone on in the<br />\nvicinity of the ballot boxes--a<br />\nviolation of campaign rules. At<br />\nno time did the behavior of the<br />\ncandidates come into question.<br />\nSince no evidence was presented indicating any unfairness<br />\nin the other elections, the<br />\nrun-offs will be held as scheduled.

The controversy over<br />\nDr. Maccini's tenure recommendation fizzled,Merganthaler<br />\nHall nearly blew up, and the Student Council Social<br />\nDirector election did blow up. But the most tragic incident<br />\noccurred Tuesday when Goucher student Ruth Aaronson<br />\nwas struck by a car at the intersection of Charles and 34th<br />\nStreets.<br />\nFortunately, Ms. Aaronson's injuries appear not to be<br />\nlife-threatening or permanent. The sad part is, they could<br />\nhave been prevented entirely. Traffic patterns on Charles<br />\nSt. in the vicinity of the Hopkins campus arc horrendous.<br />\nNot only are pedestrians endangered; the street itself is<br />\nalso quite inconvenient for motorists.<br />\nAny time hundreds of people are forced several times a<br />\nday to cross a street on which cars consistently buzz along<br />\nat speeds of over 30 miles per hour, a significant potential<br />\nhazard is present. In this case, the worst specific problem<br />\nis the single south-bound lane of Charles St. which runs<br />\nadjacent to three north-bound lanes. Inevitably, people<br />\ncrossing from the Hopkins side look right before stepping<br />\ninto the street, but forget on occasion to check the southbound lane. Every Wolman Hall resident has done it at<br />\nleast once, probably without even knowing it. Most are<br />\nlucky, but the law of averages catches up, as it did Tuesday, and as it will again if conditions are not changed.<br />\nIf Baltimore was really a first-class city, as it claims to<br />\nbe with all its \"Baltimore Is Best\" propaganda, it would<br />\ninstall subterranean passageways across the Charles and<br />\n34th St. intersection and the one at Charles, 32nd, and Art<br />\nMuseum Drive, which is even more dangerous. London and<br />\nParis have numerous such walkways, but we would not<br />\npresume to expect Baltimore to be capable of matching<br />\ntheir class. There is, however, a more practicable alternative. \u2022 Charles St. should be made one-way northbound,<br />\nexcept for the service drive next to the campus.<br />\nThis move would at least prevent a repeat of the same<br />\nspecific misfortune which befell Ruth Aaronson. It would<br />\ndo little to worsen the already-bizarre traffic snarls, for the<br />\ncurrent southbound lane has very few functions which are<br />\nnot duplicated by the service drive.

Ono<br /><br />\n0 inion<br /><br />\nCouncil Disappointing<br />\nBY GEORGE CONNOLLY<br /><br />\nI would like to express my<br />\nextreme disappointment in the<br />\nrecent actions of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nBy voting against<br />\nextending the election deadlines<br />\nthe Council showed a marked<br />\ndisinterest in furthering student<br />\ninvolvement next year. Subsequent events have also shown<br />\ndemonstrable irresponsibility in<br />\nconducting election proceedings.<br />\nMy conclusion can only be that<br />\nsome members(perhaps a majority) of the Student Council do<br />\nnot have the proper perspective<br />\ntoward student government.<br />\nCouncil should be composed of<br />\npeople who are willing to work<br />\nfor students - even do garbage<br />\nwork. I feel that students must<br />\nseriously examine future candidates in an effort to minimize<br />\nincompetance and irresponsibility.<br />\nLet us review recent events,<br />\nso that my conclusions can be<br />\nplaced in context. Last week<br />\nthe Student Council by a vote of<br />\n11 - 7- I decided against extending<br />\ndeadlines for candidate petitions<br />\nand postponing elections by one<br />\nweek. The seven who voted to<br />\nextend the deadline (Bruce<br />\nSmith, Marshal Salant, Robert<br />\nElkin, Bill Carlson, Mike Myers,<br />\nSteve Richmond, and myself)<br />\ndid so in a belief that such an<br />\nextension would give students a<br />\ngreater opportunity to become<br />\ninformed and/or involved.<br /><br />\nI believe that the majority<br />\nof those who voted against<br />\nextending the deadline did so for<br />\nhighly selfish reasons. Many<br />\nobjected to the<br />\nextra work\"<br />\nthat this change would imply.<br />\nOthers were concerned with the<br />\npolitical implications of the<br />\nproposed change. These concerns ranged from the importance of maintaining deadlines<br />\nto an outright political concern<br />\nfor the announced candidates,<br />\nand its affect on campaigns.<br />\nThese attitudes, which I am sure<br />\ndo not fully reflect the views of<br />\nthose who voted against the<br />\nchange, were clearly important<br />\nin defeating the proposed<br />\nchange.<br />\nSince last Wednesday's regrettable decision further incidents point toward an irresponsible attitude in conducting this<br />\nelection.<br />\nSunday night was<br />\nsupposed to be the candidate's<br />\nforum. Since it received very<br />\nmarginal publicity, most students were unaware of it. One<br />\nnon-candidate attended. This is<br />\nindicative of the aversion toward<br />\nwork discussed above.<br />\nThe<br />\nCouncil goofed again.<br />\nThe election itself has been<br />\nquestionable. Vindictive poli-ticking has occurred regularly at<br />\nthe ballot boxes. This politicking has included those supposedly impartial ballot box workers.<br />\nDo these irresponsible actions mark the end or negate the<br />\npotential for good student gov-<br /><br />\nernment? I don't think so.<br />\nStudent Council reached its<br />\nnadir this week. The Council<br />\nhas been doing some good<br />\nthings, but it is clear that some<br />\n(perhaps a majority) on the<br />\nCouncil are not concerned with<br />\nfairness and increased student<br />\ninterest and involvement. This<br />\ncan only be changed by radically<br />\naltering the composition of the<br />\nCouncil. Every office should be<br />\nactively contested.<br />\nIf everyone becomes involved by running for office,<br />\nencouraging others, or by voting<br />\nfor those who are most apt to<br />\nwork constructively, Student<br />\nCouncil can grow. I realize that<br />\nthis will not create a perfect<br />\nsystem, but without more interest and concern Student Council<br />\nmay continue to conduct its<br />\naffairs as it did this past week.<br />\nThe Student Council has<br />\nbeen highly irresponsible in<br />\nproceeding with this election.<br />\nLittle concern has been demonstrated for increasing student<br />\nawareness and involvement. I<br />\ncall for anyone and everyone to<br />\nbecome active in improving<br />\nstudent government. Class elections are- at the end of the<br />\nmonth.

The University<br />\nbudget is about $180 million.,<br />\nthe Hospital budget is about<br />\n$130 million., the APL budget is<br />\nabout $130 million...and that's<br />\ngoing up 9 or 10% each year<br />\nbecause of inflation alone...That<br />\nmeans that the total Johns<br />\nHopkins institutions are the size<br />\nof a pretty large corporation...It's a very large enterprise.\"<br />\nDr. Muller told the audience<br />\nthat he very rarely gets involved<br />\nin the day to day problems of<br />\nthe divisions, delegating that<br />\nresponsibility to deans and directors. I get involved other thing<br />\nI get involved in is planning,<br />\nlooking ahead, tryin to figure<br />\nout what to do next......<br />\n\"I'm very interested in the<br />\nHomewood Campus, I'm 'very<br />\ninterested in undergraduates, but<br />\nI have to give as much time to all<br />\nthe components of the University, plus the Hospital, as I do to<br />\nany other,\" said Dr. Muller, after<br />\nlisting his responsibility to<br />\nHomewood, East Baltimore,<br />\nApplied Physics Lab, School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies,<br />\npeabody,Evergreen<br />\nBologna,<br />\nHouse, and the Animal Farm.<br />\n\"This is now my eighth year in<br />\nthis crazy job.\"<br />\nDr. Muller then took questions from the audience. The<br />\nfollowing is an excerpted version<br />\nof the session which followed.<br /><br />\nHow would the janitors'<br />\nnight shift have saved $100,000?<br /><br />\n\"There may be a dispute<br />\nabout what's right and wrong,<br />\nbut there really isn't much<br />\nmystery about the fact that the<br />\neasiest and most efficient way to<br />\nclean a building is to have a team<br />\nof people go through it when it<br />\nis not in use. By team cleaning<br />\nwhen the campus is least in use<br />\nwe could do roughly the same<br />\ncleaning, have the same cleaning<br />\nefficiency with about ten fewer<br />\npeople, and ten fewer people<br />\nworks out to about $102,000.\"<br />\nWill there be more faculty<br />\ncuts?<br />\n\"We do not expect adiminstratively at Homewood to pursue any further cuts in the<br />\nfaculty. There are some new<br />\nappointments;there are also<br />\nsome people leaving. My expectation is the faculty will roughly<br />\nthe same in size next year as it is<br />\nthis year.\"<br />\nHow is the University reacting to fiscal pressures of inflation?<br /><br />\nengineering and we are very<br />\naggressively seeking more money<br />\nfor that. When things move to<br />\nthe point where we need to<br />\nmake a greater investment, the<br />\nprincipal thing we can do<br />\nis to try to find the new money<br />\nto do that. In the meantime,<br />\nmost of the other budgets, we<br />\nare trying to essentially keep as<br />\nthey are where we feel we can't<br />\nmake any cuts and then to make<br />\ncuts where we can. We are<br />\ntrying to make administrative<br />\ncuts first, support cuts second,<br />\nand academic cuts third, but it's<br />\nbeen very hard going.<br />\nHow will the Mellon Grants<br />\nbe spent?<br />\n\"They will be used for the<br />\npurposes for which they were<br />\ngiven.\" (The Mellon Foundation<br />\ndonated $300,000 for the development of the Core Curriculum,<br />\nand $750,000 for maintaining<br />\nmid-level<br />\nfaculty<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nHumanities.)<br />\nHow are you dealing with<br />\nmaintenance of the Library?<br /><br />\n\"We have been operating<br />\nwith a three year plan that<br />\ncalled for us to have about a $2<br />\nmillion deficit next year, and<br />\nthen be in balance in fiscal<br />\n'80-'81. That plan was made on<br />\nthe assumption that the rate of<br />\ninflation would be about 7%.<br />\nWell, the rate of inflation, in<br />\nfact, for 1978 turned oi4 to be<br />\n9%, which hurts. So we are in<br />\nthe process of some revisions in<br />\nthat plan. At that moment it<br />\nlooks as though our deficit for<br />\nnext year will certainly not be<br />\nbelow a million but it will be<br />\nsubstantially below this year,<br />\nand we still hope to be in<br />\nbalance by the year following<br />\nassuming that the rate of inflation does not really take off.<br />\nThe shortage of funds here has<br />\nbeen chronic and what we're<br />\ntrying to do is to expand only<br />\nwhen we can raise new funds.<br />\nFor example, the expansion in<br /><br />\n\"The Library is a desperate<br />\nproblem in two ways. First<br />\nof all the M.S.E. is just about<br />\nfull. The other problem is the<br />\nLibrary's acquisition budget<br />\nlhould be rising at a rate of<br />\nabout 14% a year just in order to<br />\nkeep up with the cost of books.<br />\nWe just have no_t been able to do<br />\nthat so what's happened is we're<br />\nbuying less new books then we<br />\nshould. In an ideal world we<br />\nwould be spending more on<br />\nlibrary acquisitions and we<br />\nwould expand the physical space<br />\nof the Library. We will do it, but<br />\nwe will do it in the way we hace<br />\nbeen doing other things; we will<br />\ndo it at a slower rate and later<br />\nthan we would like to. If this<br />\nUniversity were the only place<br />\nwhere that is happening, I think<br />\nwe would be very badly off, but<br />\nfor good or ill that's happening<br />\nall over the country. So in<br />\nrelative terms, actually Hopkins<br />\neingineering which we are pla- is at least as strong if not strongnning is based on the fact that er than most other institutions.\"<br />\nwe have already received some<br />\nnew money specifically for<br /><br />\nDo you support Director of<br />\nAdmissions Schnydman's efforts<br />\nto increase black student enrollment at Hopkins?<br />\n\"When I talked with Dean<br />\nHall and Mr. Schnydman, the<br />\nincrease in black enrollment is<br />\none of the priorities I asked him<br />\nto pursue.\"<br />\nWhy are dorm rooms as<br />\nexpensive as University apartments?<br />\n\"We have felt, and this has<br />\nbeen discussed with past Student<br />\nCouncils, that it is really fairer<br />\nto have a lottery system and<br />\ncharge everybody a uniform<br />\nrent, more or less. I think if<br />\nfreshmen paid a different rent<br />\nthan upperclassmen there would<br />\nbe a lot of resentment on the<br />\npart of the upperclassmen. I'm<br />\nglad I don't have to take responsibility for having been here<br />\nwhen those dorms were built.<br />\nThey could have been constructed with somewhat greater attention to little things like<br />\nsoundproofing.\"<br /><br />\nWill you be here in ten<br />\nyears9<br />\n1 have no contract. I serve<br />\nat the pleasure of the Board of<br />\nTrustees and I'm the one person<br />\nhere who can be fired literally<br />\novernight. And while no one has<br />\nrecently threatened me with<br />\nthat, one of my predecessors left<br />\nhere unexpectedly under conditions like that. I have no interest<br />\nin becoming President of any<br />\nother university. Given my<br />\ndruthers, I would like to be here<br />\nfor several years more. On the<br />\nother hand, you have to make a<br />\nresponsible judgment about how<br />\nlong you can do one job and<br />\nreally do it well. I don't think in<br />\nmy eighth year I'm at the<br />\npoint where I can no longer<br />\nmake a contribution. There's<br />\none other factor; I'm now 51. If<br />\nI stay here beyond 54 or 55 I<br />\nbecome almost unemployable. If<br />\nI'm suddenly asked to do<br />\nsomething else where I feel I<br />\ncould make a greater contribution, I would have to think<br />\nabout that. Something could<br />\ncome along which I would find<br />\nmore interesting.

Lately, however, I have been hounded<br />\nby a nightmare that a first-year Psychology major could<br />\ndecipher with little difficulty. In this nightmare, I am<br />\ndriving my car north on York Road. Twilight is falling,<br />\nthe streets are deserted, gas pumps cast monolithic<br />\nshadows in empty filling stations. My archaic Chevy<br />\nstarts to sputter. It breaks down and limps to a wounded stop in front of a burned-out Rustler Steak House.!<br />\ntry to get out of my car, but both doors are locked.<br />\nSuddenly everything goes black, as if someone had put<br />\nout the sun. Then I hear the footsteps...the dull echoing<br />\nthud of running feet, a stampede of sneakers, invisible,<br />\nunsyncopated, unrelenting...The light comes back on,<br />\nand I scream from the bottom of my lungs as a convoy<br />\nof joggers passes. While they run by, they pound the<br />\nroof of my car, grinning at me and singing, \"Macho,<br />\nmacho, macho man...\" That's when I wake up, my chest<br />\nheaving, my head soaking wet. My younger brother<br />\nstands over me with an empty Dixie Cup in his hand.<br />\n\"When warm weather comes,\" he tells me, \"you're<br />\nsleeping in the cellar.\"<br />\nThat gruesome dream has been responsible for my<br />\nlosing at least one night of sleep every month for the last<br />\nthree or four years. My brother talks of putting my bed<br />\nin the basement, while my parents have seriously discussed packing me off to the local Y. It's these damn<br />\njoggers (excuse me,they bust a gut unless you call them<br />\n\"runners\"). They're everywhere: uptown, downtown,<br />\non the streets, on television, in the magazines, evoy-<br /><br />\nwhere. They are legion, they are multiplying, and they<br />\nare driving me ga-ga.<br />\nWhy is it that, in the past few years, droves of<br />\nusually sane people have been donning Adidas and<br />\nsweatsuits, and subjecting themselves to long-distance<br />\ntorture? It's the thing to do, perhaps--a fad for fatties<br />\nand folks who fear fat. Like Disco and Pop Rocks,<br />\nrunning blots out boredom, or so I'm informed. To me,<br />\nrunning is boredom. Not only that, it is hazardous to<br />\none's health, despite what its proponents say.<br />\nTo prove this, let us take the case of a typical<br />\nrunner. Randall Rotund we'll call him. Randall is an<br />\ninsurance company claims adjuster who stands 5 feet 10<br />\ninches, and weights 185 pounds. You don't have to be<br />\nMarcus Welby to realize that Randall is one paunchy<br />\nclaims adjuster. In fact, his wife has told him so, and<br />\nhis boss has threatened to tie a can to Randall's grossly<br />\nobtruding tail unless the excess baggage gets dropped. So<br />\nRandall takes up jogging. He buys all the prescribed<br />\nparaphernalia--jogging shoes, sweatpants (with matching<br />\njacket), white socks, striped headband,jogging manual,<br />\njogging log book, and bumper stickers that say, \"I'd<br />\nrather be running.\" Now he's out sixty bucks. On his<br />\nfirst day of running, he rises at 5:30 a.m., two hours<br />\nearlier than usual. He stuffs himself into his jogging<br />\noutfit, forces down some Grape Nuts and a glass of<br />\nPerrier water, then starts out the front door and into the<br />\nstygian dawn with his eyes barely opened. After plodding for a half-mile, he feels a terrifying tightening in<br />\nhis side and chest. With a desperate yelp, he tumbles to<br />\nthe ground, rolling like a runaway beer keg into some<br />\nazalea bushes. No one finds him for weeks. His wife<br />\nremarries and hi\u00a7 boss hires a bright young claims<br />\nadjuster who resembles Anson Williams. Need I point<br />\nout the moral of this tragic tale?<br /><br />\nI'm starting to wonder whether my friends have<br />\nother perverse tendencies besides masochism. If they get<br />\na certain thrill out of it, I suppose that's fine. Even as<br />\nthey recount their physical agony in glorious detail, they<br />\nare apparently convinced that running benefits their<br />\ngeneral health. Ironically, they jog in a smoginfsted<br />\nmetropolis. Walking through Baltimore, especially during<br />\none of our hellish summer afternoons, is enough to<br />\nendanger one's physical well-being. People who run in<br />\nsuch conditions are flirting with suicide. They might as<br />\nwell take a quick hit off an exhaust pipe and save themselves the time and trouble ofjogging.<br /><br />\nIfl<br /><br />\nThe jogger sports a distinct air of superiority that fie<br />\nlikes to flaunt over the non-jogger. This condescending<br />\nattitude might best be summed up by the phrase, \"I'll<br />\nbet your calves aren't as firm as mine.\" Frankly, you can<br />\nkeep your firm calves. Whenever I see the scrawny<br />\nmuscular legs of a runner, I am reminded of scoops of<br />\npotato salad. I hate potato salad.<br />\nRunners like to brag, too. Male runners in particular<br />\nbona fide studs to<br />\nuse their status as<br />\nimpress members of the female persuasion. I remember<br />\nonce sitting at a party where some blond-haired hulk was<br />\nregaling several young ladies with his running exploits.<br />\nAllegedly, he ran \"fifteen miles a day, sometimes eighteen if I have the time.\" The girls were eating it up,<br />\nruffling his flaxen locks with their longing sighs. \"So<br />\nwhat,\" I interrupted, \"I'll bet he can't do this,\" whereupon I took a mighty swig of bitter lemon and gargled<br />\n\"The Theme from Shaft\" while juggling my hostess's<br />\nthree Chihuahuas. Nowadays if anyone from that party<br />\napproaches me on the street, he or she will do a quick<br />\nabout-face and duck inside the nearest building.<br />\nA popular and dangerous fallacy is that running<br />\nIv<br />\nmakes qne feel good. As one lady said to another at a<br />\nThe hucksters of America wasted little time in<br />\nTupperware party, \"That's a crock.\" Friends of mine<br />\nwho jog(and who may no longer be friends after reading milking the jogmania phenomenon for all that it's worth.<br />\nthis article) have admitted to the thundering pain that The word was passed down from Madison Avenue: no<br />\naccompanies running. Yet they confess it gives them runner is a real runner unless he is wearing an authentic,<br />\ntremendous pleasure. I'm boggled when I hear them honest-to-God, nylon acrylic sweatsuit (a bright color<br />\ndiscussing their jogging pains, or \"physical highs,\" as and the racing lines on the sides of the legs are standard<br />\nfeatures, while glow-in-the-dark stripes and the words<br />\nthey call them.<br />\n\"Oh, man, after ten miles, it's like your body is \"Gonna Fly Now\" emblazoned on the back are extras).<br />\nThe ancient Greeks were excellent athletes, and, it must<br />\nnothing but one big hurt,\"one will say.,<br />\n\"Yeah, yeah, but you just feel like going on,\" be noted, they used to run around in the buff.

How about \"Dull Throbbing Pain<br />\nPancakes,\"Stroke Stringbeans,\"\" Heart Attack Ham,\"<br />\n\"Loss of Breath Broccoli,\" \"Strained Tendon Tomato<br />\nJuice,\" and \"Blackout Barbeque\"?<br />\nThe running motif has been very vis ible on network<br />\ntelevision. We have had a Cheerios commercial where an<br />\nentire family scarf down about a half-dozen bowls of<br />\nCheerios, and then jog off together into the sunset<br />\n(apparently in search of a public john);and a Pabst Blue<br />\nRibbon commercial where the winner of a marathon,<br />\nobviously not feeling any of the effects ofjust having<br />\nrun 26 miles, relaxes right after the race with a group of<br />\nhis ecstatically cheering friends and a mug of frosty<br />\nbrew. There are other commercials of this ilk, but lack<br />\nof space and a weak stomach prohibit me from listing all<br />\nof them.<br />\nHowever, as in the case of the running recipes, I've<br />\ncome up with some original running-related TV commercials. For instance, here's one for Exxon: the scene<br />\nis a typical American avenue at morning rush hour,<br />\nexcept that there are no cars, just people running with<br />\nbrief cases and shopping bags and so forth. A concerned<br />\nvoice-over says,\"America, you've been pigging out on<br />\nthe world's oil reserves for too long. And unless you<br />\nstart conserving gasoline, rush hour will soon look like<br />\nthis.\" Or, how about this commercial for Keds All-Stars:<br />\na man wearing a pair of Keds is walking down a dark<br />\nalley near the docks, when suddenly two thugs jump out<br />\nat him. He starts to run while his assailants pursue,<br />\nand a gravelly voice-over asks, \"What would you say the<br />\nodds are of this man's escaping and living to tell the<br />\ntale? Slim, you say? Well, think again, because he's<br />\nwearing Keds All-Stars. Keds' suction-cup soles provide<br />\ntop gripping action, even on slippery back alley cobblestones.\" Anyway, those are some of my ideas. If any of<br />\nyou have similar suggestions, then by all means keep<br />\nthem to yourselves.<br />\nPerhaps the most outrageous jogging-related ad I<br />\nhave encountered is the one for Formfit Roger's Running Bra. When I first heard about this \"running bra,\" I<br />\ndeduced it must have had legs. I wondered why any<br />\nwoman would want to own a bra that was always<br />\nscooting away from her. Finally, I decided that the<br />\n\"running bra\" was invented to keep a woman company<br />\nwhenever she had to jog alone. I pictured the little<br />\nbugger (with its tiny unmentionable legs) scampering<br />\nalongside its owner, a loyal companion to the end, a<br />\nB-cup buddy after countless washings. Eventually, I was<br />\nput wise. I saw the ad for the Running Bra, which was<br />\n\"designed specifically to minimize bounce...\" This bit of<br />\nbad news serves a cruel blow to the guys who run for the<br />\nexpress purpose of watching. female joggers jiggle by.<br />\nLast week a Baltimore housewife wrote in the Sun<br />\nMagazine of her plans to form a club for \"running<br />\nwidows ,\" women whose husbands spend more and<br />\nmore time jogging, and less and less time around the<br />\nhouse.

Jogmania is breaking up the<br />\nhome. And how do Americans respond to this problem?<br />\nWell, they're certainly not taking it lying down. That's<br />\njust it; if they would lie down for just alittle while, then<br />\nthis crisis could be averted. Instead they run on like jolly<br />\nidiots, basking in the pleasant agony of their shin splints.<br />\nSurely by now some of our more thinskinned<br />\nreaders are already mentally composing their vehement<br />\nletters to the editor. I can just hear them: \"Where does<br />\nthis clown get off knocking something as pure and<br />\nwondrous as running? I'll bet the guy never went running once in his life! Leave it to you scumbags at the<br />\nNews-Letter to come up with such vile and vicious<br />\ngarbage!\" Actually, I must confess (with great shame)<br />\nthat I did once take a stab at running.

I thought<br />\njogging was it. What did I know, I was just a dumb kid.<br />\nI made the lone jog of my lifetime on a chilly<br />\nautumn afternoon. I put on my Jack Purcells, a pair of<br />\nblue jeans, several sweaters, and my Oriole cap. I looked<br />\nlike Beaver Cleaver. After telling my mother that I was<br />\nstepping out, but would return red-cheeked and well on<br />\nthe way to Stud City, I burst out the front door and<br />\nproceeded at a steady clop-clop-clop down the street.<br />\nFor the first five minutes, I felt pretty good. My<br />\nbreathing was regular, my head was clear, all systems<br />\nwere go. That is, they seemed go. At the sixth or seventh<br />\nminute, a searing pain gripped my left side. Tears came<br />\nto my eyes as I doubled over. It felt as though the Grim<br />\nReaper himself had fastened his boney claws around my<br />\nneck and rocked his knee into my groin. I got down<br />\non all fours and began moaning like a cow in labor.<br />\nRaising my head, I saw a school bus go by, and framed<br />\nin each window was a laughing face; the-derisive cackling<br />\nof those flint-hearted children bounced around in my<br />\nbrain, and right then and there I more or less decided<br />\nthat I would never again go running.<br />\nVI<br />\nI originally thought that writing this article might<br />\nserve as a kind of catharsis, purging me of my hostility<br />\ntowards jogging (oops, I mean \"running\"). But I'm<br />\nafraid it hasn't. By delineating some of the reasons for<br />\nthat hostility, I feel that I have only stoked the fire that<br />\npowers it. Call it a pet peeve, an eccentricity, a defect.<br />\nAdmittedly it reflects a certain corruptness on my part.<br />\nNevertheless, I find it virtually impossible to control(for<br />\nexample, when I'm driving and trying to maneuver my<br />\ncar around a gaggle ofjoggers who are taking up half the<br />\nroad).<br />\nAlas, poor runner, and beware! If you should be<br />\njogging somewhere in these environs and you happen to<br />\nlook over your shoulder and see a gold Chevy Nova hot<br />\non your heels, you'd best burn some rubber, son, or else<br />\nsay your prayers.

Along with masculine<br />\nand feminine, this test characterizes subjects according<br />\nto androgynous and undifferentiated. Androgynous<br />\nrefers to people who score high in both masculine and<br />\nfeminine traits, and undifferentiated refers to those who<br />\nscore low in both.<br />\nThe results: most female athletes were androgynous, and those who were androgynous tended to have<br />\nthe highest self-esteem of all the students tested. \"What<br />\nthis means,\" Harris said, \"is that many of the female<br />\nathletes had characteristics, such as the desire to work<br />\nhard and excel, that should be desirable for anyone,<br />\nregardless of gender.\"<br />\nHarris thinks the current move away from gender<br /><br />\nsimple as that.\"<br />\nRonnie Alexander, one of the original co-plaintiffs<br />\nin the case, more charitably speculated that \"Yale took<br />\nan extreme position right in the beginning, and has to<br />\nkeep up that profile.\"<br />\nWhile Yale officials and attorneys withheld out-of-court comment until the case is resolved, Price's allies in<br />\nthe courtroom evinced some worry that Yale's \"extreme<br />\nposition\" might have worked.<br />\nOne young woman, who,as the wife of a member of<br />\nYale attorney William Doyle's law firm, described herself<br />\nas \"a friend of the enemy,\" opined that \"sexual politics...shouldn't be decided in the courts.\" Nevertheless,<br />\n\"I think this is a really important problem, but this isn't<br />\nthe (right) case. They should've waited for a stronger<br />\none. What they need is some blonde, blue-eyed together<br />\nwoman.\" She flounced her hair in apparent approximation of togetherness.

The courtroom was jammed with law students,<br />\npolitical activists, housewives, administrators, alumni,<br />\nthe press and students--mostly women\u2014who filtered in<br />\nand out during the two days of testimony. In the hall<br />\noutside, though, the talk among the observers was<br />\nmostly about the mechanics of Yale's defense, and,<br />\nultimately, about why Yale was going to such lengths.<br />\nIf the University is found guilty of allowing and<br />\nfailing to provide adequate procedures for remedying<br />\nsexual harrassment, it stands to lose all of its federal<br />\nassistance. If Price wins, the school will have to set up a<br />\ngrievance procedure. Why, then, is Yale pursuing this<br />\nsuit so aggressively in the face of such stakes?<br />\n\"Male ego,\" explains one alumnus.

College students not only want to see Animal<br />\nHouse (they've helped it make over $17 million thus<br />\nfar), they want to BE Animal House. Food fights, in<br />\nshort, are becoming very popular again.<br />\nIt all started when Universal Studios and National<br />\nLampoon put on a dozen promotional toga parties at<br />\nvarious universities. Then other college unions took up<br />\nthe idea, and threw their own campus toga parties-complete with unlimited quantities of beer,jello eating<br />\ncontests, and John Belushi look-alike contests--all against<br />\nthe background of \"Louis, Louie,\" with unexpurgated<br />\nlyrics.<br />\nAlthough there seems to be an upsurge in Animal<br />\nHouse-type behavior (Kent State officials, for example,<br />\nwere compelled to warn dorm residents that<br />\nHouse-inspired noises and drinking violations would<br />\nresult in dreaded \"white slips\"), the movie's most<br />\npopular legacy appears to be the traditional food fight.<br />\nAt Texas A&amp;M,a dining hall food fight caused $900<br />\nin damages, and prompted the resignation of three food<br />\nservice employees. Eight students were expelled from<br />\nthe board program, recounts food services director Ron<br />\nBlatchely, but not before students began asking for<br />\ntransfers to other dining facilities.<br />\nSo far, Blatchely says, food fight action has been<br />\ncontained, but hard-core food fight devotees have found<br />\nother ways to express themselves.

In the past few years, the<br />\nintellectual insight and vision of these<br />\ndirectors into the aesthetic, moral and<br />\npolitical foundations of Western civilisation has made an enormous impact in<br />\ncinematic circles. The two most prolific<br />\nfilmmakers in this movement are Rainer<br />\nWerner Fassbinder and Werner Herzog.<br />\nThe interest in these two brilliant directors is indicated by the numerous showings of their films in Baltimore this year.<br />\nOn Friday the Maryland Institute of Art<br />\nwill present Herzog's La Soufriere (1977)<br />\nand Fassbinder's Why Does Herr R. Run<br />\nAmok? (1969). This opportunity to see<br />\nfilms by the most important contemporary filmmakers should not be missed.<br />\nLa Soufriere is only a 30-minute<br />\ndocumentary, but undeniably is one of<br />\nHerzog's major works. Guadeloupe was<br />\nevacuated because of an imminent<br />\nvolcano which would destroy the island,<br />\nbut there was one man who refused to<br />\nleave. Learning this, Herzog and a small<br />\ncrew flew to this deserted island and<br />\nfilmed it in anticipation of a catastrophe<br />\nwhich never came to pass. La Soufriere is<br />\na vision of a world poised on the edge of<br />\nan apocalypse,\"an extraordinary work of<br />\npersonal reportage...perhaps the truest<br />\npicture of the tempestuous yearning that<br />\nHerzog has invested on all his films,\"<br />\naccording to Tom Allen of the Village<br />\nVoice.<br />\nWhy Does Herr R. Run Amok? is a<br />\nwell-known film about'a normal, likable<br /><br />\nguy who develops into a mass-murderer.<br />\nWe become acquainted with his ordinary,<br />\njust-folks lifestyle, meeting his family,<br />\nfriends, job and idle chit-chat. One<br />\nevening, though, Herr R. calmly picks up<br />\nan ornate lamp and kills his wife, child<br />\nand a neighbor. The film records the<br />\ndestruction of his life as the film builds<br />\nand infernal despair and unbearable<br />\ntension, and Herr. R.'s act almost becomes logical.<br />\nJean-Luc Godard is one of the most<br />\nintellectual and controversial post-war<br />\nfilmmakers, and arguably the greatest.<br />\nFirst a film critic, Godard's theories have<br />\nhad enormous power over the changing<br />\naesthetic, sociological and political preoccupations of New Wave filmmaking in<br />\nFrance. Godard changed the intentions<br />\nof his craft by converting it into an<br />\nintimate game between himself and his<br />\naudience. His films have become an<br />\napplication of these principles.<br />\nIn his games, Godard makes the rules<br />\nas he goes along, allowing himself outrageous freedom in his technique, style,<br />\nstructure and narrative.<br />\nProfoundly<br />\naware of the power of the film images, he<br />\nhas shifted emphasis from the image to<br />\nthe mind that created it. Films imply<br />\nsomething about their maker, and Godard<br />\ntakes up the role of commentator on<br />\nhimself, his audience, and the cultural<br />\nrelationships between the two. He strips<br />\nthe film image of all its emotional content and shows the audience how readily<br />\nit can be cheated into accepting the<br />\nrhetoric of the filmmaker. Godard<br />\ndoesn't hypnotize his audience with his<br />\nimages, but confronts them with ques-<br /><br />\napplication of his theories, Breathless was<br />\nthe beginning of Godard's Cinematic<br />\nrevolution.<br />\nSome contend that Weekend is his<br />\nfarewell to \"commercial cinema.\" It is a<br />\nsavage eruption against Gaullist France as<br />\nGodard sets the audience up for a denunciation of the French bourgeoisie, only to<br />\nundermine this apparent satire with<br />\ndevastating scenes of carnage and destruction. A married couple decides to go on a<br />\nweekend outing with the purpose of<br />\nmurdering the wife's parents for an<br />\ninheritance. Their trip is interrupted by a<br />\nhellish landscape of burning cars and<br />\nmutilated bodies. These scenes, both<br />\nabsurd and visually disturbing, make<br />\nWeekend a most brutal film.<br />\nFrench_ film aesthetician Andre<br />\nBazin, whose theories had great influence<br />\non Godard and other New Wave filmmakers, said of Orson Welles' Citizen<br />\nKane that it \"can never be too highly<br />\npraised. Thanks to the depth of field,<br />\nwhole scenes are covered in one take, the<br />\ncamera remaining motionless. Dramatic<br />\neffects for which we had formerly relied<br />\non montage were created out of the<br />\nmovements of the actors within a fixed<br />\nA scene from Godard's Breathless<br />\nframework.\" Bazin praised this classic<br />\ntions about the very nature of the image film because it allowed the audience<br />\nnew<br />\nitself.<br />\nfreedoms in interpreting the cinematic<br />\nThe Reel World will be showing two image.

The cast<br />\nconsists of two middle aged, relatively<br />\nimmobile characters, the set does not<br />\nchange at all, costume changes are almost<br />\nnonexistent and the action centers<br />\naround a series of letters written in<br />\nthe early 20th century. But it is one of<br />\nthe many tributes to the authors of these<br />\nletters that Dear Liar is as fascinating to<br />\nan audience as a full-scale Broadway<br />\nmusical.<br />\nObviously, the letters read are not<br />\nyour run-of-the-mill \"Hi, how are you's\".<br />\nIn fact, they summarize the correspondence between George Bernard Shaw<br /><br />\nand Mrs. Patrick Campbell from 1899 to<br />\n1940. Jerome Kilty has incorporated<br />\nmany choice letters and some recorded<br />\nconversations into a fascinating portrayal<br />\nof the relationship between a leading<br />\nactress of the time and a leading playwright of all time.<br />\nIn the early 1900's, when he was<br />\n\"old enough to know better,\" Shaw fell<br />\nhead over heels in love with Mrs. Campbell. Campbell was not the only woman<br />\nShaw fell in love with during his married<br />\nyears, but the \"Stella-Joey\" relationship<br />\nwas one of his more famous affairs. Shaw<br />\nwrote Pygmalion. for Campbell, and he<br />\nwaited a long time for her to be ready to<br />\nplay it.<br /><br />\nThe letters written by Shaw and<br />\nCampbell were very dear to both of them,<br />\nand they exchanged hands several times.<br />\nIn the 1930's, when Campbell was in<br />\nfinancial trouble, Shaw sent her his letters<br />\nso that she might sell the collection if she<br />\nhad to. The letters were not sold during<br />\nCampbell's lifetime, although they were<br />\nalmost destroyed during World War II.<br />\nDear Liar is a love story told in the<br />\nparticipants' own words, wittily and,<br />\nsometimes, painfully. It is performed by<br />\na husband-wife team, Robert and Ruth<br />\nLawson Walsh. Dear Liar will be performed in The Barn Friday and Saturday<br />\nevenings at 8:30 and Sunday afternoons<br />\nat 2:15 through March 18.<br /><br />\nand a love story. Through black humor<br />\nand farce, the film satirizes social conformity, materialism and unnecessary<br />\nlaws.<br />\nHarold (Bud Cort), an extremely<br />\npale, death-obsessed youth, lives in a<br />\nplush mansion with his shrill, prudish<br />\nmother. He drives his own hearse, stages<br />\ngruesome theatrical suicides and attends<br />\nfunerals--for fun. At one funeral, Harold<br />\nmeets Maude (Ruth Gordon)--a vivacious,<br />\nlife-loving, social radical, approaching<br />\neighty. She interrupts the ceremony<br />\nto offer Harold a piece of licorace. After<br />\nthe ceremony she drives away in the<br />\npriest's Volkswagen. At the next funeral,<br />\nshe apologizes to the priest and offers<br />\nHarold a ride home-in his own hearse.<br />\nMeanwhile, at home, Harold's<br />\nmother, horrified by his gruesome theatrics, proposes several solutions. Harold<br />\nsees a psychiatrist. Uncle Victor (an army<br />\ngeneral) lectures Harold about a future in<br />\nthe Army. \"The Army takes care of its<br />\nmen,\" he exclaims, as a crippled veteran<br />\nkeels over behind them.

Angel offers three things: its<br />\nmusic breaks the sound barrier; its lead<br />\nguitarist performs gymnastic feats with<br />\nhis microphone; and it possesses a keyboard guitar that shrieks. Though my<br />\nbrother told me that Angel is not as bad<br />\nthe second time, I plan to be an hour late<br />\nfor my next Styx concert.<br />\nStyx took 45 minutes to set up, but<br />\nits performance was well worth the wait.<br />\nUnlike Kiss, Styx's make-up is not on its<br />\nmembers'faces but on the stage. To<br />\n\" clarify, Styx's special lighting effects are<br />\nnothing short of amazing; if the group<br />\never tires of rock 'n' roll, it could easily<br />\nsucceed in the magic business. A Styx<br />\nconcert features silkscreens of the covers<br />\nof its two most recent albums, Grand<br />\nIllusion and Pieces of Eight, and another<br />\nof a moving sea that is the background<br />\nfor \" Sailing Away.\" Styx's act also<br />\nincludes exploding dry ice (perhaps this is<br />\na commonplace) and, more interestingly,<br />\n\u2022a hanging kaleidoscope ball that projects<br />\nstars onto a background that changes<br />\ncolors and, for the finale, spidery astral<br />\nprojections. These lighting effects received as much applause as the music, if not<br />\nmore.<br />\nFor the most part, Styx played songs<br />\nfrom its two most recent albums: \"Great<br />\nWhite Hope,\" \"I'm OK,\" \"Grand<br />\nIllusion,\" \"Fooling Yourself,\" \"Queen of<br />\nSpades,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Lady,\" \"Blue<br />\nCollar Man,\" \"Come Sail Away\" and<br />\n\"Miss America.\" It also performed<br />\n\"Sweet\" from its 1975 Equinox album.<br />\n'Though Styx was nearly as loud as Angel,<br />\nit retained a gentle quality in its music by<br />\nmeans of an organ, a twelve-string guitar<br />\nand a quasi-folk solo on the guitar. Styx<br />\nplayed this concert fairly straight, but it<br />\nwent wild during the rendition of its<br />\ncurrent hit single, \"Renegade.\" Following a long drum solo, after which the<br />\ndrummer had the audience shout \"Toga,<br />\nToga,\" the guitarist re-entered and began<br />\nrunning back and forth across the stage.<br />\nDuring the encore, Dennis DeYoung, the<br />\nkeyboard player and one of the vocalists,<br />\nwalked onto the stage in a white surgical<br />\ncoat and began a Mick Jagger imitation<br />\nof \"I Don't Get No Satisfaction.\"<br />\nThe crowd was dull, though several<br />\nsecurity guards (one of them sported a<br />\n\"mohawk\" haircut) dragged away several<br />\nfighting spectators kicking and screaming.<br />\nAn interesting item was available to<br />\nthose who could read the handwriting on<br /><br />\nHarold<br />\nMaude<br />\ncont. from p. 17<br />\ndating service. Harold cleverly scares the<br />\ntacky computer dates away with apparent<br />\nself-mutilations.<br />\nThe scenes of Harold with his dates<br />\nare juxtaposed with scenes of Harold with<br />\nMaude. In these scenes Maude ceaselessly<br />\nexpounds on personal liberty, living life<br />\nto the fullest, individualism, nonconformity and rebellion. Harold realizes that<br />\nhe has not lived. Ruth Gordon delivers<br />\nthese monologues with such charm that<br />\nthe audience does not feel the uncomfortableness usually experienced when a<br />\ncharacter in a movie expounds on life.<br />\nThe absurdity of Harold's theatrics<br />\nmixes with Maude's outrageous radicalism<br />\nto produce a highly entertaining film.<br />\nAlthough the ending (which I will not<br />\nreveal) is sudden and unsettling, the film<br />\nhas subtly prepared the audience for it.<br />\nEarly Cat Stevens songs (Tea for the<br />\nTillerman, Mona Bone Jakon) appropriately accompany the film.<br /><br />\nWeber Lacks Star Quality<br />\nBY DEVRA SIROT<br />\nFrank Weber has never played with<br />\nLinda Ronstadt or the Rolling Stones.<br />\nHe's never been produced by Richard<br />\nParry or backed by Stevie Nicks. And<br />\nno wonder. The concert Wednesday night<br />\nin Shriver Hall auditorium was entertaining and novel at times, but Weber lacks<br />\nstar quality.<br />\nCompared to the opening act, Roger<br />\nHernandez, Weber's voice and keyboard<br />\nplaying were excellent. Weber opened<br />\nwith a biographical song, \"71,\" from<br /><br />\nhis first (and only) album, entitled As the<br />\nTime Flies., The lyrics were innovative<br />\nbut sometimes sounded fragmented. With<br />\n\"Complicated Times,\" a fast-paced tune<br />\nreminiscent of Billy Joel, the band took<br />\noff into instrumentals. The band picked<br />\nup on Frank Elmo's saxophone jazz-rock<br />\nbeat.<br />\nThough the lyrics to \"Regina\" seem<br />\nsentimental and mediocre when read, the<br />\n,rhythmic congo beat and disco quality<br />\nof the music saved the songs. Armen<br />\nHalburian, the percussionist, did an<br />\nexcellent job with bar chimes and<br /><br />\nBrazilian bells.<br />\nHalburian, Elmo and Rontiero on<br />\ndrums livened up the crowd with Nat<br />\nKing Cole's \" Straighten Up and Fly<br />\nRight.\" \" Straighten Up and Fly Right.\"<br />\nThat and a jazzed-up version of \"Take It<br />\nto the Limit\" were the best jazz work<br />\nof the evening. But \"Wait Until Tomorrow Show,\" about soap operas, was more<br />\nentertaining.

In<br />\naddition, there are a number of<br />\npromising first-year players<br />\nwho undoubtedly will contribute to the team's success.<br />\nDefensively, a highly recruited goalie named Wiley<br />\nKidd will be competing for<br />\nthe back-up spot behind junior<br />\nMike Federico.
