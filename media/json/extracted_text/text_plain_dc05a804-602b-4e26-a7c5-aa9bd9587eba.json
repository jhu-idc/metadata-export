I<br />\ncould, of course, point out that the<br />\nobservations that Mr. Schaal has<br />\ncharacterized as \"scientific\" were<br />\n<br />\nmade from such ponderous evidence as may be derived from a<br />\nstudy of nine out of the several<br />\nthousands of colleges in the United<br />\nStates.

So great is the physical<br />\ndegeneracy at old Sou'western<br />\nthat only a half dozen girls turned<br />\nin entry blanks. At first those in<br />\ncharge had reason to believe that<br />\nthere were several dozen of entrants, but it turned out that all the<br />\nblanks except six had been handed<br />\nin by a practical joker.

Therefore, if girls smoke<br />\nmore, boys will date less, and consequently study more.
