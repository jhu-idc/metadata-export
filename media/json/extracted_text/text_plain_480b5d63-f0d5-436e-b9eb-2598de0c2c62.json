JOHN'S<br />\nHoffman, Brooks, Uhler and Branham Tear Through Orange and<br />\nBlack Line for Sweeping Victory, 20 to 6\u2014Hopkins<br />\nStages Splendid Come-Back in Last Half.<br />\n<br />\nBY COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY<br />\n<br />\nHopkins accomplished one of its<br />\ngreatest objects of the season Saturday in defeating St. John's. The<br />\ngame was a disappointing one in<br />\nmany ways from the standpoint of<br />\nthe coaches, but Hopkins won the<br />\ngame\u2014and much is forgiven when<br />\na team wins a big game.<br />\nOur team started with a rush and<br />\nscored a touchdown with ease by<br />\nstraight football, even in the face<br />\nof a stiff wind. Then came the<br />\nmost decided slump and general letdown that Hopkins has experienced<br />\nthis season. In my opinion, it was<br />\nan unconscious easing up due to<br />\nover-confidence. That first touchdown, instead of serving as an incentive to the Hopkins team, tended<br />\nto make them over-confident and<br />\ncaieless. They paid dearly \u2022 for this<br />\nover-confidence, however, for St.<br />\nJohn's started a running attack<br />\nWhich was not to stop until new<br />\ndefensive tactics on the part of<br />\nHopkins in the beginning of the<br />\nsecond half checked the steady advances of the Cadets.<br />\nIn that weird first half, St. John's,<br />\nonce it found it could gain consistently around Hopkins' ends, became a new team and played better than it really knew how. Hopkins, on the other hand, instead of<br />\nbracing and rising to meet the increased strength of St. John's,<br />\nseemed to be bewildered and could<br />\nnot adjust its defense to meet the<br />\nsimple end run formation of its<br />\noPponents. I am not trying to detract one iota of credit from St.<br />\nJohn's, for their interference on this<br />\nPlay was very good, but Hopkins<br />\nshould have adjusted its defense to<br />\nmeet this style of attack. After it<br />\nwas fully explained between the<br />\nhalves, the team was able to stop<br />\nthe play during the remainder of<br />\nthe game without much trouble.<br />\nThe most pleasing feature of the<br />\ngame was that the Hopkins team<br />\nProved that it could come back and<br />\nwrest a Victory from defeat, for in<br />\nSpite of the fact that Hopkins was<br />\nahead by one point at the end of<br />\nthe first half, she had been outplayed by St. John's, and, without<br />\na great reversal of form, would<br />\nhave been a defeated team. But<br />\nthe determined spirit of victory was<br />\nin that Hopkins team, and it had<br />\nthe necessary nerve and courage to<br />\ncome through with the game.<br />\nThe St. John's team deserves<br />\ngreat credit for the splendid fight<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins steam roller advanced steadily to victory Saturday,<br />\nand although its way was hampered by many obstacles it flattened all<br />\nout, and by sheer power won out, 20 to 6.<br />\nThe game was marked by the power of Hopkins' attack on the line,<br />\nand the weakness of the ends in breaking up an ordinary end run formation. On the offensive, Hoffman and Uhler were able at nearly all<br />\nstages of the game to tear through the line for heavy gains; and on<br />\nthe defensive, Branham and Primrose were everywhere, tackling clean<br />\nand hard. Branham was responsible for the breaking up of many end<br />\nruns which should have been stopped at the wing positions; and Primrose stepped into the limelight, after a let-up of three weeks, showing<br />\nold-time form in all points of the game.<br />\nThe Black and Blue was outplayed in the first half, after it had<br />\nmade its first touchdown, but staged a great come-back in the latter<br />\npart of the game, clearly showing its superiority over the St. John's<br />\nmachine. Credit must be given the Soldiers for their excellent fight.<br />\nWhat was lacking in the end positions was made up at guard, tackle<br />\nand center. Wilkinson, Leibensperger, Barclay and Ormond played excellent football, and with the exception of the poor defense against end runs<br />\nand the partial. lack of a good interference, the team worked as a<br />\nmachine of its .type should.<br />\nThe game, play by play, was as follows:<br />\nWilkinson opened the game by<br />\nkicking off to Hartsock, who carried the - ball to the 30-yard line.<br />\nOn the next play, Alexander gained<br />\nten\u2022 yards for St. John's on a long<br />\nend run. Turner attempted another end run, but was set back two<br />\nyards. Alexander punted; the wind<br />\nmade the kick a poor one, and the<br />\nball bounded several times before<br />\nBowers captured it.<br />\nHopkins was now on the offensive and had no difficulty in approaching St. John's goal line. On<br />\nthe first play, Hoffman made twenty<br />\nyards on an end run. Brooks added<br />\nseven more. Hopkins gradually<br />\nplowed her way through St. John's<br />\nterritory. After substantial gains<br />\nby Brooks, Hoffman and Bowers,<br />\nHoffman put the ball on the i5yard line by a five-yard plunge<br />\nthrough right tackle. St. John's<br />\nwas penalized on the next play for<br />\nholding. With the pigskin on the<br />\nCadets' 5 - yard line, Hoffman<br />\nplowed through right tackle for the<br />\nfirst touchdown. Wilkinson kicked<br />\ngoal. Score: Hopkins, 7; St.<br />\nJohn's, o.<br />\nWilkinson kicked off to Stromeyer, who advanced from the 15yard line until he was spilled by<br />\nBowers on the 35-yard line. Alexander then circled left end for thirty yards, Bowers throwing him with<br />\na fine tackle. St. John's now tried<br />\na number of end runs and a double<br />\npass, but the plays did not materially advance the ball. On a fake<br />\nkick, Alexander led a twelve-yard<br />\ngain around Hopkins' right end.<br />\nThe Soldiers were penalized five<br />\n<br />\nyards for off-side play. The ball<br />\nwas now being rapidly advanced<br />\ninto Hopkins' territory. Alexander<br />\nmade a nine-yard gain around left<br />\nend and eleven more through right<br />\ntackle. On the next play, Turner<br />\nplowed through Hopkins' line for a<br />\ntouchdown. Heise failed to kick<br />\nthe goal.<br />\nGorman was sent in to replace<br />\nPinney at right end.<br />\nSt. John's kicked off to Bowers,<br />\nwho advanced to the 25-yard line.<br />\nHopkins could not break through<br />\nthe St. John's defense and, after<br />\na short gain by Hoffman, the Black<br />\nand Blue was forced to punt. The<br />\nwhistle blew and the first quarter<br />\nended with the score 7 to 6 in favor<br />\nof Hopkins.<br />\nFinney replaced Gorman. St.<br />\nJohn's started off on a long end<br />\nrun, but was penalized fifteen yards<br />\nfor holding. With the ball on the<br />\nCadets' 3-yard line, Stromeyer made<br />\na sensational ten-yard run around<br />\nright end. Alexander also circled<br />\nHopkins' ends for substantial gains.<br />\nYewell took Schmidt's place at<br />\nleft guard. Stromeyer again made<br />\na ten-yard end run and was downed<br />\nby Brooks. Sachs' replaced Finney, who had twisted his knee.<br />\nWilkinson spilled Stromeyer's next<br />\nattempt at an end run. On the next<br />\nplay, the Soldiers were penalized<br />\nfifteen yards for holding. Alexander then kicked to Bowers, who<br />\nwas downed by Dryden on Hopkins' 3o-yard line..<br />\nThe Black and Blue tried to advance the ball through St. John's.<br />\n(Continued on page 4, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nSTEAM ROLLER, GOAT, BAND<br />\nAND DUMMY FEATURE PARADE<br />\nProcession of Rooters, Bedecked With<br />\nFlags and Banners and Armed With<br />\nNoise Producers, Creates Big<br />\nSensation on March to<br />\nHomewood.<br />\n<br />\nWith flags flying, band playing,<br />\nsirens and klaxons shrieking and<br />\na very capable-looking steam roller<br />\npuffing at its head, the parade of<br />\nstudents formed on Saturday afternoon at i o'clock at McCoy Hall,<br />\nand, after a slight delay, prbceeded to Homewood via the usual<br />\nCharles street route.<br />\nAltogether, the procession was a<br />\nmost interesting, if not imposing,<br />\nspectacle. Headed by a full band,<br />\nthe steam roller, behind which<br />\ndragged a dummy dressed in a<br />\nSt. John's football suit, and a goat<br />\ndecorated. with orange and black<br />\ndrapery, all undergraduates who<br />\ncould possibly be on hand were .in<br />\nline, marching to the field of victory<br />\nwith the assurance of true conquerors. Although several stops<br />\nwere made in order to give the<br />\nsteam roller a chance to catch its<br />\nbreath, plans worked out exceedingly well and the impression created by the display was undoubtedly<br />\nas deep as that of any parade of<br />\nyears gone by.<br />\nUpon its arrival at Homewood,<br />\nthe procession, now minus the<br />\n_roller, entered the west gate of the<br />\nathletic field and proceeded past the<br />\nSt. John's stands to the section reserved for Hopkins rooters. As<br />\nthe leaders, trailing the dummy,<br />\nwhich was by this time well worn<br />\nand bedraggled, passed the St.<br />\nJohn's rooters, the noise of the<br />\nvarious instruments of ear torture<br />\nwas deafening. The rooters once<br />\nseated in the stand, the goat relegated to a safe position and fed<br />\nwith a sumptuous repast of newspapers and rags, and the band, reenforced by an orchestra of klaxons, sirens and watchmen's rattles<br />\nin position, the battle of the rival<br />\nstands was on.<br />\nCheering started with a hearty<br />\nvigor and continued through the<br />\ngame, re-enforced by as much artificial noise as could be produced<br />\nby the klaxon artillery. During<br />\nthe intermission the dummy was<br />\nhoisted on the end of a rope to a<br />\nbranch of the old pine tree, from<br />\nwhich position it shed copious tears<br />\nof sawdust over the none too sympathetic members of the band.<br />\nThe sound of the referee's final<br />\nwhistle had hardly died down when<br />\nthe occupants of the rooters' stand<br />\nswarmed over the fence, and, forming a monster \"H\" on the field of<br />\nbattle, celebrated with a final demonstration of joy the success of the<br />\nBlack and Blue steam roller.<br />\nN't<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 22, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nDEFINITE POLICY NECESSARY<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS HEAD HONORED<br />\n<br />\nNorman Angell Points Out that Lack of<br />\nPolicy Was Cause of European War.<br />\nMilitarism May Follow the<br />\nPresent Conflict.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Frank J.

The Soldiers came up to Baltimore' with<br />\nthe idea in mind that they were<br />\ngoing to carry home a victory and<br />\nthey sat through a game in which<br />\nthey saw the laurels for which<br />\nthey were working gradually being<br />\nwrested from them. After the<br />\ngame, the sportsmanlike attitude<br />\nwhich they clearly manifested impressed all who tarried to watch<br />\nthe final demonstrations by the students. It must be said that what<br />\nthey did was not an easy thing to<br />\ndo, and the fact that they did it with<br />\nsuch evident sincerity reflects high<br />\ncredit upon them.<br />\nThe Steam Roller.<br />\n<br />\nThe steam roller is the emblem<br />\nof irresistible force. Before it,<br />\nnothing can stand; after it, there<br />\nconies the victorious march of the<br />\nconquerors. The steam roller was<br />\nthe token of the first great army<br />\nthat swept into Austria; the steam<br />\nroller was the symbol of Wilhelm<br />\nhimself for the advance of the Germans; the steam roller was the<br />\nproud battle cry of the \"royal<br />\nfamily\" of very Baltimore in the<br />\nbalmiest days of undivided allegiance. The steam roller means victory\u2014relentless, on-sweeping victory\u2014the triumph of the machine.<br />\nThe triumph of the machine,<br />\nbrains and bodies adjusted to instinctive unity\u2014we have seen it,and,<br />\nby its own token, we have heralded<br />\nit! The team, the coaches and the<br />\nrooters\u2014the Hopkins steam roller\u2014<br />\nit has gone on and on, one rival<br />\nafter the other has been crushed beneath its invincible onslaught, its<br />\n<br />\nsteel is bloody with its latest triumph. There remains but one obstruction in its path\u2014one mighty<br />\nbarrier between it and its goal.<br />\nThere is a groaning of joints, a<br />\ncreaking of hinges, a pulsing of engines. It moves steadily, irresistibly; it is advancing on to the last<br />\nobstacle that stands before it, and<br />\nits victory is sure, for it is the<br />\nsteam roller\u2014the Hopkins steam<br />\nroller\u2014and it is indomitable.<br />\nNext!<br />\n<br />\nNow that the St. John's game is<br />\nover and our rivals have been satisfactorily humbled, the time has<br />\ncome for the consideration of what<br />\nis undoubtedly, from every point<br />\nof view, the most important game<br />\nof the season \u2014 the Thanksgiving<br />\nDay contest with the Maryland<br />\nAgricultural College.<br />\nNot only does the game with the<br />\nAggies come at the close of the<br />\nseason, but it comes also as a very<br />\nreal climax on the Hopkins schedule. Always represented by a<br />\nstrong and aggressive team, the Agricultural College has this year developed one of the most powerful<br />\norganizations in its history, and this<br />\ncombination is standing as the one<br />\nsignificant barrier in the way of the<br />\nrealization of Hopkins' long-desired<br />\nchampionship of the State.<br />\nA consideration of comparative<br />\nscores gives little or no indication<br />\nas to the outcome of Thursday's<br />\ncontest, but it justifies the confidence felt by each institution in the<br />\nteam which will represent it. Both<br />\nlarge scores and great confidence<br />\nhave frequently proved to be misleading in the matter of football victories, however, and this has been<br />\nparticularly the case during the<br />\npresent season. The savage determination that led Yale to triumph<br />\nover Princeton is of more value<br />\nthan a remembrance of past triumphs, or a rosy faith in the future.<br />\nThe Maryland Aggies cannot beat<br />\na Johns Hopkins that is willing to<br />\ngo the limit, to fight savagely and to<br />\nthe end.<br />\nThough every member of the<br />\nteam be bruised and limping,<br />\nthough not a Hopkins man be able<br />\nto speak above a whisper in the<br />\nweek following the Aggie game, it<br />\nwill be a memorable week of very<br />\nreal triumph if the new Hopkins<br />\nspirit has made itself felt in the<br />\nState, and Brickley's team has won<br />\nthe Maryland championship. Football victories are not empty triumphs\u2014they have a moral effect on<br />\nthe entire student body that is both<br />\nsignificant and lasting. Johns Hopkins really needs a victory in the<br />\nAggie game. It would mean that,<br />\ngiven a good start toward a successful season, the punch was present that is required to make accomplished facts of potentialities. Johns<br />\nHopkins will win the game if every<br />\nHopkins man really and sincerely<br />\nwants it to, and is ready to do his<br />\nutmost in the way of assistance.<br />\nThe chance is ours\u2014are we big<br />\nenough to take it? Who will win<br />\nthe Aggie game Thanksgiving<br />\nDay?<br />\n<br />\nBLACK AND BLUE STEAM ROLLER<br />\nRIDES TO VICTORY OVER ST. JOHN'S<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\n<br />\nline. Several attempts made by<br />\nHoffman and Brooks were unsuccessful, and Hopkins was forced to<br />\nkick. Alexander, who caught the<br />\nball, advanced to the 25-yard line<br />\nand the Orange and Black made<br />\nfifteen yards more by the hard line<br />\nplunging of Jarman and Stromeyer.<br />\nAt this point the Soldiers were penalized five yards, but Alexander<br />\nmade up the loss by advancing the<br />\nball five yards on a long run around<br />\nright end. He made another similar attempt on the next play, but<br />\nfailed. Stromeyer again came into<br />\nthe limelight by making a sensational plunge through center, netting thirty-eight yards. He put the<br />\npigskin on Hopkins' 18-yard line,<br />\nand, on a short end run, brought<br />\nthe ball to the io-yard line. Uhler<br />\nwent in, taking Brooks' place.<br />\nStromeyer made three yards<br />\nthrough right tackle, but on the<br />\nnext play, St. John's fumbled;<br />\nHoffman regained the ball on the<br />\n5-yard line, and the Black and Blue<br />\npunted out of danger.<br />\nAfter failing in several plays to<br />\nadvance the ball, St. John's attempted a drop-kick, but the pigskin fell fifteen yards short. Hopkins, now on the offensive, also<br />\nfailed to gain and was compelled<br />\nto punt. Jarman caught the ball<br />\nand advanced ten yards. Time for<br />\nthe first half was called with the<br />\nball on Hopkins' 25-yard line.<br />\nScore: Hopkins, 7; St. John's, 6.<br />\nIn the second half, Primrose took<br />\nthe place of Ormond. Heise kicked<br />\noff. Uhler caught the ball and ran<br />\nup to Hopkins' 30-yard line. Hoffman, after going through the line<br />\nfor three yards, was, on the next<br />\nplay, pushed back five and was<br />\nforced to punt.<br />\nThe Soldiers lost five yards on<br />\na double pass and on the next play<br />\nfailed to complete a forward pass.<br />\nAlexander kicked, and St. John's<br />\nwas penalized fifteen yards for interfering with Bowers when he was<br />\ntrying to catch the ball.<br />\nHoffman went through the line<br />\nfor twenty yards. Uhler tore off<br />\nfive more. Hopkins then made the<br />\nfirst successful forward pass of the<br />\ngame, Hoffman to Leibensperger.<br />\nThe play netted fifteen yards. The<br />\npigskin was now on St. John's 10yard line. First Hoffman forged<br />\nahead for five yards, then Uhler<br />\nadded three more. Hoffman carried the ball over on the next play,<br />\nand Wilkinson kicked the goal.<br />\nScore: Hopkins, 14; St. John's 6.<br />\nOn the kick-off, Selby, who<br />\ncaught the ball, was knocked out<br />\nby Primrose's hard tackle. Stromeyer made four yards, but then<br />\nlost five when Leibensperger put<br />\nhim back on an attempted long end<br />\nrun. St. John's punted to Bowers,<br />\nwho placed the ball on the 30-yard<br />\nline. The Soldiers appeared to<br />\nweaken. Uhler and Hoffman had<br />\nno trouble in alternately plowing<br />\nthrough St. John's line. Branham<br />\n<br />\nand Bowers plunged through center<br />\nfor considerable gains. The third<br />\nquarter ended with the ball on the<br />\n25-yard line.<br />\nOn the first play of the last quarter, Uhler made two yards, and<br />\nHoffman followed with five more.<br />\nA Hopkins penalty (fifteen yards<br />\nfor holding) placed the ball on the<br />\n20-yard line. A beautiful forward<br />\npass, Hoffman to Fulton, cleared<br />\nsixteen yards, and, with the ball on<br />\nthe Cadets' 4-yard line, Uhler went<br />\nthrough for a touchdown. Wilkinson failed to kick goal. Score:<br />\nHopkins, 20; St. John's, 6.<br />\nThere was no further scoring<br />\nduring the game. Hopkins kicked<br />\noff. The ball was downed on St.<br />\nJohn's 25-yard line. The Soldiers<br />\ncould not advance the ball and<br />\npunted. Hopkins now gradually<br />\npushed on. Hoffman, Uhler and<br />\nBranham all made substantial gains.<br />\nHoffman tried a long pass to Fulton, but it failed. On the next play,<br />\nHoffman attempted a drop-kick,<br />\nwhich just missed the bar. The<br />\nball was put on St. John's 20-yard<br />\nline. They made a first down on<br />\nline plunging and then attempted<br />\na forward pass, which was caught<br />\nby Hoffman. Hopkins failed to<br />\ngain and kicked.<br />\nSt. John's, on the offensive, tried<br />\nlong end runs, but they were unable to advance the ball. After an<br />\nattempted forward pass, the ball<br />\nwent to Hopkins on downs. Darley was sent in for Bowers. The<br />\nBlack and Blue advanced fifteen<br />\nyards and then was forced to kick.<br />\nSt. John's, after trying a number of forward passes (all of which<br />\nfailed), punted to Darley. Frank<br />\nreplaced Barclay. Hoffman tore off<br />\nten yards and Uhler added five<br />\nmore. The ball was now on St.<br />\nJohn's 2o-yard line. A number of<br />\nHopkin's substitutes were sent in\u2014<br />\nDuncan for Hoffman, Sonneborn<br />\nfor Wilkinson and Aubrey for Leibensperger. A slow advance was<br />\nmade toward the St. John's goal<br />\nline, but time was called before the<br />\nball could be taken over.

JOHN'S<br />\nHoffman, Brooks, Uhler and Branham Tear Through Orange and<br />\nBlack Line for Sweeping Victory, 20 to 6\u2014Hopkins<br />\nStages Splendid Come-Back in Last Half.<br /><br />\nBY COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY<br /><br />\nHopkins accomplished one of its<br />\ngreatest objects of the season Saturday in defeating St. John's. The<br />\ngame was a disappointing one in<br />\nmany ways from the standpoint of<br />\nthe coaches, but Hopkins won the<br />\ngame\u2014and much is forgiven when<br />\na team wins a big game.<br />\nOur team started with a rush and<br />\nscored a touchdown with ease by<br />\nstraight football, even in the face<br />\nof a stiff wind. Then came the<br />\nmost decided slump and general letdown that Hopkins has experienced<br />\nthis season. In my opinion, it was<br />\nan unconscious easing up due to<br />\nover-confidence. That first touchdown, instead of serving as an incentive to the Hopkins team, tended<br />\nto make them over-confident and<br />\ncaieless. They paid dearly \u2022 for this<br />\nover-confidence, however, for St.<br />\nJohn's started a running attack<br />\nWhich was not to stop until new<br />\ndefensive tactics on the part of<br />\nHopkins in the beginning of the<br />\nsecond half checked the steady advances of the Cadets.<br />\nIn that weird first half, St. John's,<br />\nonce it found it could gain consistently around Hopkins' ends, became a new team and played better than it really knew how. Hopkins, on the other hand, instead of<br />\nbracing and rising to meet the increased strength of St. John's,<br />\nseemed to be bewildered and could<br />\nnot adjust its defense to meet the<br />\nsimple end run formation of its<br />\noPponents. I am not trying to detract one iota of credit from St.<br />\nJohn's, for their interference on this<br />\nPlay was very good, but Hopkins<br />\nshould have adjusted its defense to<br />\nmeet this style of attack. After it<br />\nwas fully explained between the<br />\nhalves, the team was able to stop<br />\nthe play during the remainder of<br />\nthe game without much trouble.<br />\nThe most pleasing feature of the<br />\ngame was that the Hopkins team<br />\nProved that it could come back and<br />\nwrest a Victory from defeat, for in<br />\nSpite of the fact that Hopkins was<br />\nahead by one point at the end of<br />\nthe first half, she had been outplayed by St. John's, and, without<br />\na great reversal of form, would<br />\nhave been a defeated team. But<br />\nthe determined spirit of victory was<br />\nin that Hopkins team, and it had<br />\nthe necessary nerve and courage to<br />\ncome through with the game.<br />\nThe St. John's team deserves<br />\ngreat credit for the splendid fight<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins steam roller advanced steadily to victory Saturday,<br />\nand although its way was hampered by many obstacles it flattened all<br />\nout, and by sheer power won out, 20 to 6.<br />\nThe game was marked by the power of Hopkins' attack on the line,<br />\nand the weakness of the ends in breaking up an ordinary end run formation. On the offensive, Hoffman and Uhler were able at nearly all<br />\nstages of the game to tear through the line for heavy gains; and on<br />\nthe defensive, Branham and Primrose were everywhere, tackling clean<br />\nand hard. Branham was responsible for the breaking up of many end<br />\nruns which should have been stopped at the wing positions; and Primrose stepped into the limelight, after a let-up of three weeks, showing<br />\nold-time form in all points of the game.<br />\nThe Black and Blue was outplayed in the first half, after it had<br />\nmade its first touchdown, but staged a great come-back in the latter<br />\npart of the game, clearly showing its superiority over the St. John's<br />\nmachine. Credit must be given the Soldiers for their excellent fight.<br />\nWhat was lacking in the end positions was made up at guard, tackle<br />\nand center. Wilkinson, Leibensperger, Barclay and Ormond played excellent football, and with the exception of the poor defense against end runs<br />\nand the partial. lack of a good interference, the team worked as a<br />\nmachine of its .type should.<br />\nThe game, play by play, was as follows:<br />\nWilkinson opened the game by<br />\nkicking off to Hartsock, who carried the - ball to the 30-yard line.<br />\nOn the next play, Alexander gained<br />\nten\u2022 yards for St. John's on a long<br />\nend run. Turner attempted another end run, but was set back two<br />\nyards. Alexander punted; the wind<br />\nmade the kick a poor one, and the<br />\nball bounded several times before<br />\nBowers captured it.<br />\nHopkins was now on the offensive and had no difficulty in approaching St. John's goal line. On<br />\nthe first play, Hoffman made twenty<br />\nyards on an end run. Brooks added<br />\nseven more. Hopkins gradually<br />\nplowed her way through St. John's<br />\nterritory. After substantial gains<br />\nby Brooks, Hoffman and Bowers,<br />\nHoffman put the ball on the i5yard line by a five-yard plunge<br />\nthrough right tackle. St. John's<br />\nwas penalized on the next play for<br />\nholding. With the pigskin on the<br />\nCadets' 5 - yard line, Hoffman<br />\nplowed through right tackle for the<br />\nfirst touchdown. Wilkinson kicked<br />\ngoal. Score: Hopkins, 7; St.<br />\nJohn's, o.<br />\nWilkinson kicked off to Stromeyer, who advanced from the 15yard line until he was spilled by<br />\nBowers on the 35-yard line. Alexander then circled left end for thirty yards, Bowers throwing him with<br />\na fine tackle. St. John's now tried<br />\na number of end runs and a double<br />\npass, but the plays did not materially advance the ball. On a fake<br />\nkick, Alexander led a twelve-yard<br />\ngain around Hopkins' right end.<br />\nThe Soldiers were penalized five<br /><br />\nyards for off-side play. The ball<br />\nwas now being rapidly advanced<br />\ninto Hopkins' territory. Alexander<br />\nmade a nine-yard gain around left<br />\nend and eleven more through right<br />\ntackle. On the next play, Turner<br />\nplowed through Hopkins' line for a<br />\ntouchdown. Heise failed to kick<br />\nthe goal.<br />\nGorman was sent in to replace<br />\nPinney at right end.<br />\nSt. John's kicked off to Bowers,<br />\nwho advanced to the 25-yard line.<br />\nHopkins could not break through<br />\nthe St. John's defense and, after<br />\na short gain by Hoffman, the Black<br />\nand Blue was forced to punt. The<br />\nwhistle blew and the first quarter<br />\nended with the score 7 to 6 in favor<br />\nof Hopkins.<br />\nFinney replaced Gorman. St.<br />\nJohn's started off on a long end<br />\nrun, but was penalized fifteen yards<br />\nfor holding. With the ball on the<br />\nCadets' 3-yard line, Stromeyer made<br />\na sensational ten-yard run around<br />\nright end. Alexander also circled<br />\nHopkins' ends for substantial gains.<br />\nYewell took Schmidt's place at<br />\nleft guard. Stromeyer again made<br />\na ten-yard end run and was downed<br />\nby Brooks. Sachs' replaced Finney, who had twisted his knee.<br />\nWilkinson spilled Stromeyer's next<br />\nattempt at an end run. On the next<br />\nplay, the Soldiers were penalized<br />\nfifteen yards for holding. Alexander then kicked to Bowers, who<br />\nwas downed by Dryden on Hopkins' 3o-yard line..<br />\nThe Black and Blue tried to advance the ball through St. John's.<br />\n(Continued on page 4, col. 3)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nSTEAM ROLLER, GOAT, BAND<br />\nAND DUMMY FEATURE PARADE<br />\nProcession of Rooters, Bedecked With<br />\nFlags and Banners and Armed With<br />\nNoise Producers, Creates Big<br />\nSensation on March to<br />\nHomewood.<br /><br />\nWith flags flying, band playing,<br />\nsirens and klaxons shrieking and<br />\na very capable-looking steam roller<br />\npuffing at its head, the parade of<br />\nstudents formed on Saturday afternoon at i o'clock at McCoy Hall,<br />\nand, after a slight delay, prbceeded to Homewood via the usual<br />\nCharles street route.<br />\nAltogether, the procession was a<br />\nmost interesting, if not imposing,<br />\nspectacle. Headed by a full band,<br />\nthe steam roller, behind which<br />\ndragged a dummy dressed in a<br />\nSt. John's football suit, and a goat<br />\ndecorated. with orange and black<br />\ndrapery, all undergraduates who<br />\ncould possibly be on hand were .in<br />\nline, marching to the field of victory<br />\nwith the assurance of true conquerors. Although several stops<br />\nwere made in order to give the<br />\nsteam roller a chance to catch its<br />\nbreath, plans worked out exceedingly well and the impression created by the display was undoubtedly<br />\nas deep as that of any parade of<br />\nyears gone by.<br />\nUpon its arrival at Homewood,<br />\nthe procession, now minus the<br />\n_roller, entered the west gate of the<br />\nathletic field and proceeded past the<br />\nSt. John's stands to the section reserved for Hopkins rooters. As<br />\nthe leaders, trailing the dummy,<br />\nwhich was by this time well worn<br />\nand bedraggled, passed the St.<br />\nJohn's rooters, the noise of the<br />\nvarious instruments of ear torture<br />\nwas deafening. The rooters once<br />\nseated in the stand, the goat relegated to a safe position and fed<br />\nwith a sumptuous repast of newspapers and rags, and the band, reenforced by an orchestra of klaxons, sirens and watchmen's rattles<br />\nin position, the battle of the rival<br />\nstands was on.<br />\nCheering started with a hearty<br />\nvigor and continued through the<br />\ngame, re-enforced by as much artificial noise as could be produced<br />\nby the klaxon artillery. During<br />\nthe intermission the dummy was<br />\nhoisted on the end of a rope to a<br />\nbranch of the old pine tree, from<br />\nwhich position it shed copious tears<br />\nof sawdust over the none too sympathetic members of the band.<br />\nThe sound of the referee's final<br />\nwhistle had hardly died down when<br />\nthe occupants of the rooters' stand<br />\nswarmed over the fence, and, forming a monster \"H\" on the field of<br />\nbattle, celebrated with a final demonstration of joy the success of the<br />\nBlack and Blue steam roller.<br />\nN't<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 22, 1915.<br /><br />\nDEFINITE POLICY NECESSARY<br /><br />\nHOPKINS HEAD HONORED<br /><br />\nNorman Angell Points Out that Lack of<br />\nPolicy Was Cause of European War.<br />\nMilitarism May Follow the<br />\nPresent Conflict.<br /><br />\nDr. Frank J.

There must be a preparedness of policy. It was because Europe had no policy that she could<br />\nnot maintain peace, and if you do<br />\nnot tell Europe what your intentions are, what your policy is, you<br />\nwill find yourself in a war. If you.<br />\nstate what your behavior is to be<br />\non this hemisphere and in the<br />\nworld at large, then I say the greater your armament the greater the<br />\ngood to the rest of the world.

The Soldiers came up to Baltimore' with<br />\nthe idea in mind that they were<br />\ngoing to carry home a victory and<br />\nthey sat through a game in which<br />\nthey saw the laurels for which<br />\nthey were working gradually being<br />\nwrested from them. After the<br />\ngame, the sportsmanlike attitude<br />\nwhich they clearly manifested impressed all who tarried to watch<br />\nthe final demonstrations by the students. It must be said that what<br />\nthey did was not an easy thing to<br />\ndo, and the fact that they did it with<br />\nsuch evident sincerity reflects high<br />\ncredit upon them.<br />\nThe Steam Roller.<br /><br />\nThe steam roller is the emblem<br />\nof irresistible force. Before it,<br />\nnothing can stand; after it, there<br />\nconies the victorious march of the<br />\nconquerors. The steam roller was<br />\nthe token of the first great army<br />\nthat swept into Austria; the steam<br />\nroller was the symbol of Wilhelm<br />\nhimself for the advance of the Germans; the steam roller was the<br />\nproud battle cry of the \"royal<br />\nfamily\" of very Baltimore in the<br />\nbalmiest days of undivided allegiance. The steam roller means victory\u2014relentless, on-sweeping victory\u2014the triumph of the machine.<br />\nThe triumph of the machine,<br />\nbrains and bodies adjusted to instinctive unity\u2014we have seen it,and,<br />\nby its own token, we have heralded<br />\nit! The team, the coaches and the<br />\nrooters\u2014the Hopkins steam roller\u2014<br />\nit has gone on and on, one rival<br />\nafter the other has been crushed beneath its invincible onslaught, its<br /><br />\nsteel is bloody with its latest triumph. There remains but one obstruction in its path\u2014one mighty<br />\nbarrier between it and its goal.<br />\nThere is a groaning of joints, a<br />\ncreaking of hinges, a pulsing of engines. It moves steadily, irresistibly; it is advancing on to the last<br />\nobstacle that stands before it, and<br />\nits victory is sure, for it is the<br />\nsteam roller\u2014the Hopkins steam<br />\nroller\u2014and it is indomitable.<br />\nNext!<br /><br />\nNow that the St. John's game is<br />\nover and our rivals have been satisfactorily humbled, the time has<br />\ncome for the consideration of what<br />\nis undoubtedly, from every point<br />\nof view, the most important game<br />\nof the season \u2014 the Thanksgiving<br />\nDay contest with the Maryland<br />\nAgricultural College.<br />\nNot only does the game with the<br />\nAggies come at the close of the<br />\nseason, but it comes also as a very<br />\nreal climax on the Hopkins schedule. Always represented by a<br />\nstrong and aggressive team, the Agricultural College has this year developed one of the most powerful<br />\norganizations in its history, and this<br />\ncombination is standing as the one<br />\nsignificant barrier in the way of the<br />\nrealization of Hopkins' long-desired<br />\nchampionship of the State.<br />\nA consideration of comparative<br />\nscores gives little or no indication<br />\nas to the outcome of Thursday's<br />\ncontest, but it justifies the confidence felt by each institution in the<br />\nteam which will represent it. Both<br />\nlarge scores and great confidence<br />\nhave frequently proved to be misleading in the matter of football victories, however, and this has been<br />\nparticularly the case during the<br />\npresent season. The savage determination that led Yale to triumph<br />\nover Princeton is of more value<br />\nthan a remembrance of past triumphs, or a rosy faith in the future.<br />\nThe Maryland Aggies cannot beat<br />\na Johns Hopkins that is willing to<br />\ngo the limit, to fight savagely and to<br />\nthe end.<br />\nThough every member of the<br />\nteam be bruised and limping,<br />\nthough not a Hopkins man be able<br />\nto speak above a whisper in the<br />\nweek following the Aggie game, it<br />\nwill be a memorable week of very<br />\nreal triumph if the new Hopkins<br />\nspirit has made itself felt in the<br />\nState, and Brickley's team has won<br />\nthe Maryland championship. Football victories are not empty triumphs\u2014they have a moral effect on<br />\nthe entire student body that is both<br />\nsignificant and lasting. Johns Hopkins really needs a victory in the<br />\nAggie game. It would mean that,<br />\ngiven a good start toward a successful season, the punch was present that is required to make accomplished facts of potentialities. Johns<br />\nHopkins will win the game if every<br />\nHopkins man really and sincerely<br />\nwants it to, and is ready to do his<br />\nutmost in the way of assistance.<br />\nThe chance is ours\u2014are we big<br />\nenough to take it? Who will win<br />\nthe Aggie game Thanksgiving<br />\nDay?<br /><br />\nBLACK AND BLUE STEAM ROLLER<br />\nRIDES TO VICTORY OVER ST. JOHN'S<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br /><br />\nline. Several attempts made by<br />\nHoffman and Brooks were unsuccessful, and Hopkins was forced to<br />\nkick. Alexander, who caught the<br />\nball, advanced to the 25-yard line<br />\nand the Orange and Black made<br />\nfifteen yards more by the hard line<br />\nplunging of Jarman and Stromeyer.<br />\nAt this point the Soldiers were penalized five yards, but Alexander<br />\nmade up the loss by advancing the<br />\nball five yards on a long run around<br />\nright end. He made another similar attempt on the next play, but<br />\nfailed. Stromeyer again came into<br />\nthe limelight by making a sensational plunge through center, netting thirty-eight yards. He put the<br />\npigskin on Hopkins' 18-yard line,<br />\nand, on a short end run, brought<br />\nthe ball to the io-yard line. Uhler<br />\nwent in, taking Brooks' place.<br />\nStromeyer made three yards<br />\nthrough right tackle, but on the<br />\nnext play, St. John's fumbled;<br />\nHoffman regained the ball on the<br />\n5-yard line, and the Black and Blue<br />\npunted out of danger.<br />\nAfter failing in several plays to<br />\nadvance the ball, St. John's attempted a drop-kick, but the pigskin fell fifteen yards short. Hopkins, now on the offensive, also<br />\nfailed to gain and was compelled<br />\nto punt. Jarman caught the ball<br />\nand advanced ten yards. Time for<br />\nthe first half was called with the<br />\nball on Hopkins' 25-yard line.<br />\nScore: Hopkins, 7; St. John's, 6.<br />\nIn the second half, Primrose took<br />\nthe place of Ormond. Heise kicked<br />\noff. Uhler caught the ball and ran<br />\nup to Hopkins' 30-yard line. Hoffman, after going through the line<br />\nfor three yards, was, on the next<br />\nplay, pushed back five and was<br />\nforced to punt.<br />\nThe Soldiers lost five yards on<br />\na double pass and on the next play<br />\nfailed to complete a forward pass.<br />\nAlexander kicked, and St. John's<br />\nwas penalized fifteen yards for interfering with Bowers when he was<br />\ntrying to catch the ball.<br />\nHoffman went through the line<br />\nfor twenty yards. Uhler tore off<br />\nfive more. Hopkins then made the<br />\nfirst successful forward pass of the<br />\ngame, Hoffman to Leibensperger.<br />\nThe play netted fifteen yards. The<br />\npigskin was now on St. John's 10yard line. First Hoffman forged<br />\nahead for five yards, then Uhler<br />\nadded three more. Hoffman carried the ball over on the next play,<br />\nand Wilkinson kicked the goal.<br />\nScore: Hopkins, 14; St. John's 6.<br />\nOn the kick-off, Selby, who<br />\ncaught the ball, was knocked out<br />\nby Primrose's hard tackle. Stromeyer made four yards, but then<br />\nlost five when Leibensperger put<br />\nhim back on an attempted long end<br />\nrun. St. John's punted to Bowers,<br />\nwho placed the ball on the 30-yard<br />\nline. The Soldiers appeared to<br />\nweaken. Uhler and Hoffman had<br />\nno trouble in alternately plowing<br />\nthrough St. John's line. Branham<br /><br />\nand Bowers plunged through center<br />\nfor considerable gains. The third<br />\nquarter ended with the ball on the<br />\n25-yard line.<br />\nOn the first play of the last quarter, Uhler made two yards, and<br />\nHoffman followed with five more.<br />\nA Hopkins penalty (fifteen yards<br />\nfor holding) placed the ball on the<br />\n20-yard line. A beautiful forward<br />\npass, Hoffman to Fulton, cleared<br />\nsixteen yards, and, with the ball on<br />\nthe Cadets' 4-yard line, Uhler went<br />\nthrough for a touchdown. Wilkinson failed to kick goal. Score:<br />\nHopkins, 20; St. John's, 6.<br />\nThere was no further scoring<br />\nduring the game. Hopkins kicked<br />\noff. The ball was downed on St.<br />\nJohn's 25-yard line. The Soldiers<br />\ncould not advance the ball and<br />\npunted. Hopkins now gradually<br />\npushed on. Hoffman, Uhler and<br />\nBranham all made substantial gains.<br />\nHoffman tried a long pass to Fulton, but it failed. On the next play,<br />\nHoffman attempted a drop-kick,<br />\nwhich just missed the bar. The<br />\nball was put on St. John's 20-yard<br />\nline. They made a first down on<br />\nline plunging and then attempted<br />\na forward pass, which was caught<br />\nby Hoffman. Hopkins failed to<br />\ngain and kicked.<br />\nSt. John's, on the offensive, tried<br />\nlong end runs, but they were unable to advance the ball. After an<br />\nattempted forward pass, the ball<br />\nwent to Hopkins on downs. Darley was sent in for Bowers. The<br />\nBlack and Blue advanced fifteen<br />\nyards and then was forced to kick.<br />\nSt. John's, after trying a number of forward passes (all of which<br />\nfailed), punted to Darley. Frank<br />\nreplaced Barclay. Hoffman tore off<br />\nten yards and Uhler added five<br />\nmore. The ball was now on St.<br />\nJohn's 2o-yard line. A number of<br />\nHopkin's substitutes were sent in\u2014<br />\nDuncan for Hoffman, Sonneborn<br />\nfor Wilkinson and Aubrey for Leibensperger. A slow advance was<br />\nmade toward the St. John's goal<br />\nline, but time was called before the<br />\nball could be taken over.
