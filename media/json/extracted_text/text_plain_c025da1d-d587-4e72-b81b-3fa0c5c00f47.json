WINS CHAMPIONSHIP<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nVIRGINIA IS STILL HOLDING OUT<br />\n<br />\nAN APPEAL TO HOPKINS MEN<br />\nDefeats Black and Blue by the Score of<br />\n54 to 0\u2014 Presents Unusually Powerful Eleven\u2014Brewer the Individual Star.<br />\n<br />\nOn Thanksgiving Day, before<br />\nan audience of nearly 8,000 persons that filled every available<br />\nspace about Homewood Field,<br />\nMaryland State College won the<br />\nMaryland football championship<br />\nby defeating Hopkins' Varsity<br />\neleven by the large and overwhelming score of 54 to 0. State<br />\nstarted the ball rolling in the first<br />\nfive minutes of play by scoring<br />\ntwo touchdowns in quick succession, and from that time until the<br />\nclose of the contest the size of<br />\ntheir score depended for the most<br />\npart on the time left for play.<br />\nHopkins lost to a superior team.<br />\nAt no time did the Black and<br />\nBlue threaten the visitors' goal<br />\nline. Although the teamwork of<br />\nthe Black and Blue eleven was<br />\nmuch improved over that of last<br />\nweek, the team as a whole played<br />\nwith an absence of the spirit and<br />\ndetermination that is usually exhibited in such contests.<br />\nThe overwhelming defeat of<br />\nHopkins came as a surprise to<br />\neveryone.<br />\nIt w a s generally<br />\nthought that the Black and Blue<br />\nhad a strong defensive eleven that<br />\nwould at least be able to hold the<br />\nvisitors to a small score. However, it was soon evident that Hopkins was up against one of the<br />\nmost powerful aggregations ever<br />\nseen in action on Homewood<br />\nField. In short, from the first<br />\nblow of the whistle until the end<br />\nof the fourth quarter it was simply a walkover for the visitors.<br />\nThey had a line superior to that<br />\nof Hopkins and a much superidr<br />\nbackfield, so that by straight football they were able to carry the<br />\nball down the field at will. State's<br />\nattack on Thursday consisted of<br />\na line plunging team, and their<br />\ngains were made mostly by<br />\ndelayed passes off - tackle and<br />\nthrough guard.<br />\nState's great victory was made<br />\npossible largely by the excellent<br />\nwork of Brewer and Fletcher.<br />\nThese two stellar backs were<br />\neasily the individual stars of the<br />\ncontest. Brewer did most of the<br />\nground gaining for State, ran a<br />\nkick-off for a touchdown kicked<br />\ntwo drop-kicks and added the deciding punch toward several other<br />\ntouchdowns.<br />\nState scored three touchdowns<br />\nin the first quarter. The first<br />\ncame soon after State had received the ball on the kick-off on<br />\nher own 40-yard line. Then the<br />\nvisitors began a terrific drive<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nThe movement for undergraduate football at Hopkins has<br />\nat last blazed forth. It will come up for discussion before the<br />\nAthletic Board some time this week; the Mail Bag rings with<br />\nit; The News-Letter has devoted its entire editorial space to its<br />\nconsideration. 1 his week is only the beginning; before the<br />\nquestion is decided, one way or the other, every phase of it<br />\nmust be subjected to thorough research, every argument on<br />\neither side must be impartially weighed. Undergraduate football is a personal matter to every Hopkins man. The NewsLetter is the official organ of the Johns Hopkins University;<br />\nthrough its columns alone can the question be presented.<br />\nThis is a personal appeal to every Hopkins Graduate, Senior,<br />\nJunior, Sophomore, and _Freshman. What do you think of<br />\nundergraduate football? Is it necessary? Is it possible? Is it<br />\nadvisible? Is there an alternative? It makes no difference<br />\nwhether what you have to say has been expressed before, even<br />\nin the very words which you yourself would use. It makes<br />\nno difference whether you are for undergraduate football or<br />\nagainst it. It makes no difference whether the letters submitted run up into the dozens\u2014if necessary,the Mail Bag will be<br />\nextended until it fills half the paper.

D.,<br />\nof Princess Anne county, Va., contains a valuable bequest to the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nAccording to a clause of the<br />\nwill, the bequest includes bacteriological material and specimens, as<br />\nwell as valuable books, journals<br />\nand papers directly or indirectly<br />\nrelating to the subject of medicine. Bookcases, a Century dictionary and an Encyclopedia Brittanica and other equipment are<br />\nalso included. The bequest iS<br />\nmade with the understanding that<br />\na library shall be formed, to be<br />\nknown as the departmental library of the department of pathology of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School; that this library<br />\nshall occupy a room to itself.<br />\nThe bequest was made to the<br />\nUniversity over a year ago, but<br />\nthe will has not been probated<br />\nuntil recently. Preparations are<br />\nnow going on for the transportation of the books and specimens<br />\nto the Medical School.<br />\n<br />\nFollowing the Hopkins custom<br />\nof having the freshman-sophomore<br />\nfootball game on the Saturday<br />\nafter Thanksgiving week, the<br />\ngame will be played on Saturday,<br />\nDecember 9.<br />\nCoach Pfitsch has had his<br />\nfreshman team out and running<br />\nthrough their signals for the past<br />\ncouple of weeks, but since many<br />\nof the ' sophomores are on the<br />\n'Varsity squad, the 1919 team<br />\nwill hold their initial practice today. Captain Schmidt has a good<br />\nfighting crowd of men under him,<br />\nas was proved last fall when they<br />\nheld the fast and heavy junior<br />\neleven, composed largely of 'Varsity men, to a scoreless tie.<br />\nThe lineup will probably be as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n<br />\nSophomores\u2014Ends, Allen and<br />\nGatchell; tackles, Schmidt and<br />\nSonneborn; guards, Stanley and<br />\nBenson; center, Hecht; quarterback, Kirk or Wasserman; halfbacks, Meyer, Frisch and Wells;<br />\nfullback, Cox.<br />\nFreshmen\u2014 Ends, Knipp,<br />\nHolmes and Norwood; tackles,<br />\nWood and Calkins; guards Clark<br />\nand Weaver; center, Freedom or<br />\nTownsend; quarterback, Silberstein or Tipton; halfbacks, Coulter, Reaney or Cashell; fullback,<br />\nTurner or Stewart.<br />\n<br />\nInsists Upon Change in Conditions of<br />\nDebating Triangle\u2014Hopkins Council Adheres to Former Plan.<br />\nSubmits Subject.<br />\n<br />\nThe continuation of the debating triangle between the universities of North Carolina, Virginia<br />\nand Hopkins is still unsettled.<br />\nNorth Carolina, however, has signified its willingness to debate<br />\nunder the old conditions, and only<br />\nVirginia is still holding out for a<br />\nchange in the agreement.<br />\nThe proposal which is delaying<br />\nthe progress of the debates this<br />\nyear is the one submitted by Virginia two weeks ago\u2014the abolition of the plan by which neither<br />\nteam of any of the three universities debated on its home ground,<br />\nand, the substitution in its place<br />\nof some arrangement by which<br />\neach institution would have at<br />\nleast one team debating on its<br />\nown territory.<br />\nHopkins' objections to this plan<br />\nare two-fold: First, the sending<br />\naway of the teams affords the de;<br />\nhaters an experience and extends<br />\nthe relations of the University in<br />\na manner which would otherwise<br />\nbe unobtaitiable; and, second, it<br />\nwould do away with the strict impartiality of the judges, which the<br />\npresent system guarantees.<br />\nIt is always difficult, the Debating Council holds, to obtain men<br />\nto judge debates who will really<br />\njudge according to the strict debating qualities of the teams, and<br />\nwho will ndt be unconsciously influenced one way or the other by<br />\nquestions of sentiment. University professors undoubtedly form<br />\nthe best judges, and, when they<br />\nare judges of a debate between<br />\ntwo universities, with both of<br />\nwhich they are absolutely unconnected, their superiority is unquestioned.<br />\nUnder Virginia's<br />\nplan, such judges would be practically impossible of access,<br />\nThe question which Hopkins<br />\nwill submit to the other two debating councils for agreement, in<br />\ncase the triangle is to be continued, has already been decided<br />\nupon. It is, \"Resolved, that, constitutionality waived, legislation<br />\nproviding for the compulsory arbitration of labor disputes in public utilities and prohibiting all<br />\nstrikes and lockouts in such utilities should b,e enacted.\"<br />\nThis question brings up for discussion an issue in which the entire country is vitally interested,<br />\nand one which affords ample opportunity for clear-cut debate.<br />\nThe questions submitted to the<br />\nother two councils will probably<br />\nbe received within the next week.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE ORGANIZES DEC. 14<br />\nEvery Prospective Player Invited to Be<br />\nPresent at Meeting\u2014Speeches to Be<br />\nMade by Past and Present<br />\nHopkins Stars.<br />\n<br />\nThe organization meeting of the<br />\n1917 lacrosse team will be held<br />\nThursday, December 14, at 5 P.<br />\nM. in the Y.

But the one fact is<br />\nclear\u2014as far as any intelligent,<br />\nloyal, sustaining spirit is concerned,. Hopkins' backing of a<br />\nfootball team is practically nil.<br />\nThere remains for consideration one item in the present system, an item which, in its practical effects, is the most important of .all\u2014the lack of daylight<br />\npractice. As a general rule, practice for the 'Varsity eleven began<br />\nthis year in the neighborhood of<br />\n6 o'clock. There was scarcely one<br />\nafternoon during tlie entire season in which the arc lights were<br />\nnot lit before the men entered the<br />\nfierd. How important a part that<br />\ncondition occupied in the list of<br />\nthe season's defeats can be realized, if in no other way, by a<br />\nhasty glancing over of Coach<br />\nBrennick's reviews of the various<br />\ngames. Our team had no forward<br />\npasses to speak of, almost entirely<br />\nbecause of the fact that forward<br />\npasses can not be practiced by the<br />\nlight of the moon. Lack of daylight practice was the greatest<br />\nsingle cause of this season's<br />\nrecord. Whether that practice<br />\ncould be secured for an undergraduate team, like the increase<br />\nof spirit which such a team would<br />\nbring, is a debatable question, but<br />\nhere likewise, one fact is self-evident\u2014as long as men who are not<br />\nreleased from a Broadway laboratory until after 5 o'clock must<br />\nreach Homewood field before<br />\npractice can be begun, daylight<br />\nscrimmages are impossible.<br />\nThere is one \"strong argument<br />\nagainst undergraduate football in<br />\nany college or university which<br />\nmust be here considered\u2014the almost inevitable danger of the upbuilding of a system of athletic<br />\nscholarships which in itself is a<br />\nserious menace to the aims and<br />\nideals of the institution in which<br />\nit finds root. Such a menace<br />\nwould be present were undergraduate football to be adopted at<br />\nHopkins. In the desire to bring<br />\nforth winning teams, an amount,<br />\nof pressure which can hardly be<br />\nestimated would be levied upon<br />\nour Athletic Association to create<br />\nfor football players who would<br />\ncome to Hopkins a special fund,<br />\nwhich by judicious distribution<br />\njust within the margin of technical safety, would amply compensate them for their attendance. Against the evils of such a<br />\nsystem it is unnecessary to speak,<br />\nall the more in that the evil does<br />\ndefinitely exist and flourish in a<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1916.<br />\ngreat number of colleges. Iet<br />\nsuch an evil, realized, could be<br />\nguarded against: If Hopkins is<br />\nto, have undergraduate teams, it<br />\nwants them to be representative<br />\nof the real body of its undergraduates; it can never have a<br />\nsystem by Which, however indirectly, men are paid to play for<br />\nit. That evil can be guarded<br />\nagainst\u2014but pnly by thorough<br />\nunderstanding of its possible<br />\npresence before any new system is<br />\nundertaken.<br />\nThis, then, is the present football situation: A team whose upbuilding is dependent chiefly<br />\nupon luck, with no settled policy,<br />\nexcept one of opportunism; inevitable lack of daylight practice;<br />\nState championship the only goal;<br />\nutter absence of- future prospect<br />\nof success, even for that championship; and half-hearted and<br />\nunstable student backing. Against<br />\nthis may be placed the ideal of an<br />\nundergraduate team \u2014 composed<br />\nof men known by every undergraduate student, gradually building up, through a settled policy of<br />\ndevelopment of raw material, an<br />\naggregation which may meet universities -more suited to the reputation of Johns Hopkins University than the institutions which<br />\nnow hold the center of attention<br />\nin the football schedule. Whether<br />\nthis ideal is attainable, must be<br />\nconsidered separately; judging it<br />\nby the goal alone, THE NEWS-LETTER is of the opinion, and believes<br />\nin that opinion to be voicing the<br />\nsentiment of the great majority<br />\nof Hopkins students, that undergraduate football is infinitely preferable to the present system.<br />\nThe real question, however,'is of<br />\nthat very attainability\u2014whether,<br />\neven if undergraduate football is<br />\nin itself desirable, it is practical.<br />\nAnd by practical is ineant not the<br />\nmere possibility of having an undergraduate team, but the possibility of having a team which<br />\nshall represent its University<br />\nworthily.<br />\nIn this phase of the discussion,<br />\nfirst of all is heard the 6.37, \"But<br />\nundergraduate football was tried<br />\nat Hopkins\u2014and it failed.\" In<br />\nconnection with that cry, the following table of undergraduate enrollments since 1912 may be of<br />\nsome interest:<br />\n200<br />\n1912-13<br />\n263<br />\n1913-14<br />\n289<br />\n1914-15<br />\n393<br />\n1915-16<br />\nIn other words, within four<br />\nyears there has been an increase<br />\n<br />\nin the undergraduate enrollment<br />\nof almost 100 per cent. Moreover,<br />\nof the 393 undergraduates of this<br />\nyear, 164 were freshmen, which,<br />\nalmost inevitably, means that the<br />\nincrease in the size of the undergraduate department is to be consistently continued.<br />\nThe next question is: Is a body<br />\nof 400 men large enough to enable<br />\na good football team to be built<br />\nup? The answer to this question<br />\nlikewise can be indicated by a<br />\nfew figures. The Haverford team,<br />\nwhich defeated Hopkins this season, was drawn from an enrollment of 195; the Swarthmore<br />\neleven, which, in addition to Hopkins, defeated the University of<br />\nPennsylvania, was built up from<br />\na total undergraduate enrollment<br />\nof 441\u2014and Swarthmore is co-ed.<br />\nBut from these figures immediately arises the query: Granted<br />\nthat there are enough potential<br />\nfootball players at Hopkins to<br />\nform a .good team, would they<br />\ncome out in sufficient 'force to<br />\nmake such a team possible?<br />\nThe query has reference, first,<br />\nof course, to the fact that both<br />\nHaverford and Swarthmore have<br />\ndormitories, while Hopkins has<br />\nnone; that the men at those institutions, by reason of the circumstances in which they are situated, take a more active interest<br />\nin college activities than do Hopkins men. The fact that the presence of dormitories does aid\u2014and<br />\naid materially \u2014 in the development of a football team is incontrovertible. Yet it has been definitely announced that Hopkins<br />\nis to have a dormitory within the<br />\nnear future. Also, the change in<br />\natmosphere produced by the removal to Homewood is unquestioned.<br />\nThis year there were 25 juniors,<br />\nsophomores and freshmen listed<br />\nupon the roll book of the football<br />\nmanager; and, in addition, it is estimated that there were at least<br />\n10 men practicing with the team<br />\nat various times during the season who never definitely enrolled.<br />\nThis would make a nucleus of approximately 35 men upon which to<br />\nbuild an undergraduate team next<br />\nyear, irrespective of the incoming<br />\nclass, and irrespective of the men<br />\nfrom the present three'classes who<br />\nmight come out for a strictly<br />\nundergraduate team when they<br />\nwould not be aroused by the appeal of a, team conducted under<br />\nthe present system. And those<br />\nfacts are as far as anyone can go.<br />\nWhether that nucleus would be<br />\n<br />\nsufficient, how many men the<br />\nClass of 1921 will furnish for the<br />\nsquad, whether the number of<br />\nthose reporting for practice with<br />\nan undergraduate team who did<br />\nnot come out for the present team<br />\nwill be large or negligible, are all<br />\nquestions which offer wide field<br />\nfor discussion \u2014 questions which<br />\ncan only be answered, in the first<br />\nand last cases, by the men concerned.<br />\nThere is one- very important<br />\nmatter connected with the possibility of undergraduate football,<br />\nhowever, which does permit of<br />\ndefinite anticipation\u2014the matter<br />\nof daylight practice. With undergraduate football, such practice<br />\nwill admittedly be possible\u2014the<br />\nonly question is whether it can<br />\nbe obtained. Daylight practice<br />\ndoes not mean ten or twenty minutes in the twilight; it means the<br />\nrelease of the football - players<br />\nfrom laboratories at some such<br />\ntime as 4 o'clock. It takes no'<br />\ndeep student of football to state<br />\nthat, without such practice, no<br />\nsuccessful team can be developed,<br />\nwhatever, system be employed.<br />\nWith the possibility of such practice, however, which the elimination of graduate students would<br />\ninsure, a determined effort can be<br />\nmade, once for all, to arrange<br />\nsome schedule by which the players can obtain their release at<br />\nsome such time\u2014always with the.<br />\nunderstanding that the work be<br />\nmade up at some other time. If<br />\nthe faculty is both willing and<br />\nable to work out such a schedule,<br />\nit is the opinion of THE NEWSLETTER that undergraduate football can be successful. It is upon<br />\nthis one matter that the whole<br />\nquestion will probably be found<br />\nto hinge.<br />\nThere are three possible alternatives to undergraduate football:<br />\n(a) Delay, (b) a four-year eligibility rule, (c) a three-year elgibility rule.<br />\nThe first of these alternatives<br />\nis in opposition to the feeling<br />\nof the student body. There is a<br />\ngeneral conviction, at the present<br />\ntime, that whatever is going to<br />\n,be done, should be planned now.<br />\nThis does not mean that we should<br />\nnecessatily have undergraduate<br />\nfootball next year, if we are to<br />\nhave it at all; it is easily conceivpble that, should the movement be successful, the Athletic<br />\nAssociation would desire a yearor two leeway in order to develop<br />\nt he system before its definite introduction. But some action should<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\nbe taken; if Hopkins is going to<br />\nhave undergraduate football, it<br />\nwants to begin work this year; if<br />\nit is not going to have undergraduate football, it must know<br />\nthis year either why it does not<br />\nwant it or why it is not going to<br />\nhave it.<br />\nThe second alternative proposition\u2014a rule providing that no<br />\n'Varsity' player shrould have had<br />\nmore than four years of collegiate<br />\nfootball, wherever those years<br />\nhave been spent\u2014is one which<br />\nseems to have a number of adherents. The objection to this<br />\nplan, however, is that it would<br />\nnot remedy the evil for which it<br />\nwas intended. The great majority<br />\nof colleges have a three-year eligibility rule, due to the fact that<br />\ntheir freshmen are not allowed to<br />\nplay upon 'varsity teams. If Hopkins were to pass a four-year rule,<br />\nit is true it would allow the playing of those graduate students<br />\nwho have not played football at<br />\nother colleges; but, at the same<br />\ntime, it would not prohibit the<br />\nseeking of players among the<br />\ngraduate students of the first<br />\nyear. As a matter of fact, the<br />\nonly change which such a rule<br />\n.would probably make in the present system would be the restriction of the search for ready-developed players to one graduate<br />\nclass, instead of the larger field<br />\nwhich is now available.<br />\nA three-year eligibility rule<br />\nwould probably accomplish the<br />\ndesired end, but it would do so at<br />\nthe sacrifice, for the up-building<br />\nof the team, of all the football<br />\nmaterial which there -happens to<br />\nbe in the Freshman Class \u2014 for<br />\nsuch a rule, of course, depends<br />\nupon the ineligibility of freshmen.<br />\nAt some future time that plan<br />\nmay be adopted, but it cannot be<br />\nadopted at a time when the<br />\nFreshman Class contains almost<br />\none half of the undergraduate enrollment. To develop undergraduate teams, for the first few<br />\nyears, at least, Hopkins will need<br />\nthe services of every available undergraduate.<br />\nIn concluding this discussion,<br />\none fact must be emphasized:<br />\nHopkins should take no step without a full realization of the consequences which that step entails.<br />\nThe question of undergraduate<br />\nfootball must be considered in<br />\nevery possible phase before it is<br />\ndecided one way or the other. It<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nshould not be swept through<br />\nmerely as a reaction from last<br />\nThursday's defeat; for, however<br />\ngood an argument for some<br />\nehange in system that defeat may<br />\nform, the arguments for and<br />\nagainst undergraduate football<br />\nrest upon bases far deeper than<br />\nthe results of a single game.

In the first<br />\nplace, it is not fair to criticise<br />\nthe medical students who have<br />\ncome out and played, even if they<br />\nhaven't practiced, for practically<br />\nall of them are there, not of their<br />\nown volition, but because it was<br />\nurged that it .was their duty.<br />\nThe other and more serious<br />\npoint is the slight amount of censure which the undergraduate<br />\nstudents received, who were such<br />\npoor sports and had the welfare<br />\nof Hopkins so little at heart that<br />\nthey could not practice clean<br />\nthrough the season, regardless of<br />\nwhether they made the team or<br />\nwhether they were displaced by<br />\nsome med who was not so good<br />\nexcept in reputation.<br />\nNo criticism can be strong<br />\nenough of the chap who is so absorbed in himself that he is unable to make this sacrifice. It<br />\nis folly to talk of an dndergraduate team or any other kind of<br />\nteam while such men are allowed<br />\nto stay in college without being<br />\nmade to realize what pitiful mean<br />\nlittle quitters they are. Every<br />\nman that can play football, if he<br />\nhas at all gotten the real Hopkins<br />\nspirit\u2014give, rather than get\u2014<br />\nought to be willing to practice<br />\nall four years without reward if<br />\nhis services will be of the least<br />\nvalue.<br />\nIn conclusion, I want to make<br />\na suggestion in regard to the daylight practice. It seems to me it<br />\nhas been tackled wrong end fore.<br />\nNow that the laboratories are at<br />\nHomewood and no time is lost in<br />\ntransit, would it not be much<br />\nmore feasible for practice to be<br />\nheld from 1 to 3 o'clock, when<br />\nthere is plenty of sun? Then let<br />\nthe men go to the laboratory until six. In this way no time<br />\nwould be lost and the proposition ought to be regarded much<br />\nmore favorably by the faculty<br />\nthan those which propose cutting<br />\noff an hour in some way or shape<br />\nfrom the football men's time in<br />\nthe laboratory.<br />\nTwo hours (from one to three)<br />\n-of good hard practice under a<br />\ncoach who knew his business and<br />\nwasted no time would be infinitely more valuable than an indefinite period from four until dark<br />\nor moonrise, with the team struggling in by driblets.<br />\n<br />\n:<br />\nSir\u2014I understand the question<br />\nof football changes is to come up<br />\nin the near future, with the sentiment in favor of an undergraduate team. The four-year rule, it<br />\nseems to me, embodies what<br />\nchange is necessary, and would<br />\nnot exclude the medical or graduate students who come out of<br />\ntheir own free will and work<br />\nequally as hard as the undergraduates. The objection should not<br />\nbe to the meds, as such, but to<br />\nthe coaching spirit which plays<br />\nthem without sufficient practice.<br />\nIf the team is really to represent<br />\nJohns Hopkins University it must<br />\nbe open to these departments, as<br />\nwell as to the undergraduates.<br />\nThe basic difficulty lies in the<br />\nspirit back of the Hopkins football policy. There has apparently<br />\nbeen a desire on the part of the<br />\n\"powers that be\" to get a winning<br />\nteam, regardless of the means.<br />\nTo this end seasoned men have<br />\nbeen wanted, rather than mere<br />\nmaterial. Our lacrosse team-:\u2014<br />\nand, in fact, the teams of most<br />\nother institutions\u2014show that a<br />\ncontinuously successful series of<br />\nteams is not developed that way.<br />\nRather it is a question of training this year by diligent ground<br />\nwork the players that will form<br />\nthe machines of next year and the<br />\nyear after. In that way only can<br />\na policy develop a system that<br />\nwill build a team machine, rather<br />\nthan a collection of individual<br />\nstars hurriedly thrown together<br />\nhelter-skelter and miscalled a<br />\nteam. The material of this year's<br />\nteam, if properly coached throughout an entire season, would undoubtedly have made as good a<br />\nfootball machine as any we have<br />\nhad.<br />\nOur problem is to find a coach<br />\nwho is sufficiently closely connected to us, so that he can build<br />\nkir the future rather than for one<br />\nyear alone.

But we would prefer<br />\nto fight our ,own battles, though<br />\nthey may be losing ones. To use<br />\na simile which, though perhaps<br />\nexaggerated, nevertheless illustrates the point at issue\u2014we are<br />\nlike the small boy in an uphill<br />\nfight with his neighbor, but who<br />\ncannot help feeling ashamed when<br />\nhis big brother comes to his aid,<br />\nand turns the tide in his favor.<br />\nMoreover, he is subject to the ridicule of his friends, just as we<br />\nhave become the subject of ridicule, not only throughout the rest<br />\nof the State, but in our own city<br />\nof Baltimore.<br />\nOur present system of athletics<br />\nleaves Hopkins' prospects uncertain at the beginning of every season. We never know when we<br />\n<br />\n1:1<br />\ncan count on the aid of the medical college and graduates. A start<br />\nis made with a few undergraduate martyrs, who, unless they<br />\nshow the form of finished veterans within a short interval of<br />\npractice, are replaced one by one<br />\nby medicos or graduates (dragged<br />\nfrom studies which admittedly<br />\nleave little time for football), who<br />\nhave had long experience in other<br />\nuniversities, and who display<br />\ngreater individual ability than<br />\nthe undergraduates. Not only<br />\nmust these men bk fitted into the<br />\nmachine, however, but this moil<br />\ndifficult work must be carried on<br />\nunder the -handicap of darkness,<br />\nan impediment brought about<br />\nmainly because these very men<br />\nare unable to report early. Again,<br />\n-the presence of these veterans discourages undergraduates of little<br />\nexperience, but who have the makings of stars, from coming out.<br />\nThe coach has nothing to develop<br />\nfor future years, and this, to quote<br />\nthe aptly stated lines of \"Would-<br />\n<br />\n\f9<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1916.<br />\nBe Rooter,\" forces us to pursue<br />\n, the policy of \"Give us enough<br />\nready-developed men, and we will<br />\nturn out a successful team.\"<br />\nIt has been shown by other<br />\nwriters what other colleges, such<br />\nas Haverford, have accomplished<br />\nwith less material, and we are<br />\nall familiar with the work of St.<br />\nJohn's and other State colleges.<br />\nThere is no reason why we cannot do the same.

Recently they have become<br />\nmore scarce, even at Hopkins.<br />\nThey are, however, not extinct.<br />\nAbout a month ago, after losing<br />\nsome money on a game, an undergraduate friend of mine turned<br />\npessimist; the team did not suit<br />\nhim at all. The following argument gave him temporary relief:<br />\n-\"We do not have a 'big league'<br />\nfootball team because we do not<br />\ngive athletic scholarships or<br />\notherwise commercialize our athletics as most other colleges do,<br />\nbecause our blacklist is notoriously strict, because we lay more<br />\nstress on laboratory work than on<br />\nfootball. We have good reason to<br />\nbe proud of a pcior team.\"<br />\nA week later he had another attack. This was his complaint:<br />\n\"Undergraduates are getting excited over a proposed -change in<br />\nour athletic system. Both the<br />\nchange and the excitement are<br />\ncontrary to all good precedent.\"<br />\nI answered: \"The change does<br />\nnot seem to involve a sacrifice of<br />\nthe true Hopkins standards; its<br />\ndiscussion is a sign of increased<br />\ninterest and should be welcomed<br />\nwith joy.\"<br />\nAgain his disease broke out,this<br />\ntime in a contagious form. He infected me by showing me an advertisement printed by the Hullabaloo board in which the old Hopkins was alluded to as \"the dingy<br />\nbuildings of the past\"\u2014coupled<br />\nwith which is a later statement to<br />\nthe effect that \"Hopkins traditions are nil.\". This time I symphathized with him in earnest.<br />\nI have waited in vain for a protest from the undprgraduate body.<br />\nThe tragedy lies not in the mere<br />\nevidence of shallowness and lack<br />\nof appreciation, but in the fact<br />\nthat the student body permits<br />\nsuch statements to go on record<br />\nunchallenged.

State<br />\nstarted the ball rolling in the first<br />\nfive minutes of play by scoring<br />\ntwo touchdowns in quick succession, and from that time until the<br />\nclose of the contest the size of<br />\ntheir score depended for the most<br />\npart on the time left for play.<br />\nHopkins lost to a superior team.<br />\nAt no time did the Black and<br />\nBlue threaten the visitors' goal<br />\nline. Although the teamwork of<br />\nthe Black and Blue eleven was<br />\nmuch improved over that of last<br />\nweek, the team as a whole played<br />\nwith an absence of the spirit and<br />\ndetermination that is usually exhibited in such contests.<br />\nThe overwhelming defeat of<br />\nHopkins came as a surprise to<br />\neveryone.<br />\nIt w a s generally<br />\nthought that the Black and Blue<br />\nhad a strong defensive eleven that<br />\nwould at least be able to hold the<br />\nvisitors to a small score. However, it was soon evident that Hopkins was up against one of the<br />\nmost powerful aggregations ever<br />\nseen in action on Homewood<br />\nField. In short, from the first<br />\nblow of the whistle until the end<br />\nof the fourth quarter it was simply a walkover for the visitors.<br />\nThey had a line superior to that<br />\nof Hopkins and a much superidr<br />\nbackfield, so that by straight football they were able to carry the<br />\nball down the field at will. State's<br />\nattack on Thursday consisted of<br />\na line plunging team, and their<br />\ngains were made mostly by<br />\ndelayed passes off - tackle and<br />\nthrough guard.<br />\nState's great victory was made<br />\npossible largely by the excellent<br />\nwork of Brewer and Fletcher.<br />\nThese two stellar backs were<br />\neasily the individual stars of the<br />\ncontest. Brewer did most of the<br />\nground gaining for State, ran a<br />\nkick-off for a touchdown kicked<br />\ntwo drop-kicks and added the deciding punch toward several other<br />\ntouchdowns.<br />\nState scored three touchdowns<br />\nin the first quarter. The first<br />\ncame soon after State had received the ball on the kick-off on<br />\nher own 40-yard line. Then the<br />\nvisitors began a terrific drive<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 3)<br /><br />\nThe movement for undergraduate football at Hopkins has<br />\nat last blazed forth.

The bequest iS<br />\nmade with the understanding that<br />\na library shall be formed, to be<br />\nknown as the departmental library of the department of pathology of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School; that this library<br />\nshall occupy a room to itself.<br />\nThe bequest was made to the<br />\nUniversity over a year ago, but<br />\nthe will has not been probated<br />\nuntil recently.

University professors undoubtedly form<br />\nthe best judges, and, when they<br />\nare judges of a debate between<br />\ntwo universities, with both of<br />\nwhich they are absolutely unconnected, their superiority is unquestioned.<br />\nUnder Virginia's<br />\nplan, such judges would be practically impossible of access,<br />\nThe question which Hopkins<br />\nwill submit to the other two debating councils for agreement, in<br />\ncase the triangle is to be continued, has already been decided<br />\nupon. It is, \"Resolved, that, constitutionality waived, legislation<br />\nproviding for the compulsory arbitration of labor disputes in public utilities and prohibiting all<br />\nstrikes and lockouts in such utilities should b,e enacted.\"<br />\nThis question brings up for discussion an issue in which the entire country is vitally interested,<br />\nand one which affords ample opportunity for clear-cut debate.<br />\nThe questions submitted to the<br />\nother two councils will probably<br />\nbe received within the next week.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1916.<br /><br />\nLACROSSE ORGANIZES DEC. 14<br />\nEvery Prospective Player Invited to Be<br />\nPresent at Meeting\u2014Speeches to Be<br />\nMade by Past and Present<br />\nHopkins Stars.<br /><br />\nThe organization meeting of the<br />\n1917 lacrosse team will be held<br />\nThursday, December 14, at 5 P.<br />\nM. in the Y.

But the one fact is<br />\nclear\u2014as far as any intelligent,<br />\nloyal, sustaining spirit is concerned,. Hopkins' backing of a<br />\nfootball team is practically nil.<br />\nThere remains for consideration one item in the present system, an item which, in its practical effects, is the most important of .all\u2014the lack of daylight<br />\npractice. As a general rule, practice for the 'Varsity eleven began<br />\nthis year in the neighborhood of<br />\n6 o'clock. There was scarcely one<br />\nafternoon during tlie entire season in which the arc lights were<br />\nnot lit before the men entered the<br />\nfierd. How important a part that<br />\ncondition occupied in the list of<br />\nthe season's defeats can be realized, if in no other way, by a<br />\nhasty glancing over of Coach<br />\nBrennick's reviews of the various<br />\ngames. Our team had no forward<br />\npasses to speak of, almost entirely<br />\nbecause of the fact that forward<br />\npasses can not be practiced by the<br />\nlight of the moon. Lack of daylight practice was the greatest<br />\nsingle cause of this season's<br />\nrecord. Whether that practice<br />\ncould be secured for an undergraduate team, like the increase<br />\nof spirit which such a team would<br />\nbring, is a debatable question, but<br />\nhere likewise, one fact is self-evident\u2014as long as men who are not<br />\nreleased from a Broadway laboratory until after 5 o'clock must<br />\nreach Homewood field before<br />\npractice can be begun, daylight<br />\nscrimmages are impossible.<br />\nThere is one \"strong argument<br />\nagainst undergraduate football in<br />\nany college or university which<br />\nmust be here considered\u2014the almost inevitable danger of the upbuilding of a system of athletic<br />\nscholarships which in itself is a<br />\nserious menace to the aims and<br />\nideals of the institution in which<br />\nit finds root. Such a menace<br />\nwould be present were undergraduate football to be adopted at<br />\nHopkins. In the desire to bring<br />\nforth winning teams, an amount,<br />\nof pressure which can hardly be<br />\nestimated would be levied upon<br />\nour Athletic Association to create<br />\nfor football players who would<br />\ncome to Hopkins a special fund,<br />\nwhich by judicious distribution<br />\njust within the margin of technical safety, would amply compensate them for their attendance. Against the evils of such a<br />\nsystem it is unnecessary to speak,<br />\nall the more in that the evil does<br />\ndefinitely exist and flourish in a<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1916.<br />\ngreat number of colleges. Iet<br />\nsuch an evil, realized, could be<br />\nguarded against: If Hopkins is<br />\nto, have undergraduate teams, it<br />\nwants them to be representative<br />\nof the real body of its undergraduates; it can never have a<br />\nsystem by Which, however indirectly, men are paid to play for<br />\nit. That evil can be guarded<br />\nagainst\u2014but pnly by thorough<br />\nunderstanding of its possible<br />\npresence before any new system is<br />\nundertaken.<br />\nThis, then, is the present football situation: A team whose upbuilding is dependent chiefly<br />\nupon luck, with no settled policy,<br />\nexcept one of opportunism; inevitable lack of daylight practice;<br />\nState championship the only goal;<br />\nutter absence of- future prospect<br />\nof success, even for that championship; and half-hearted and<br />\nunstable student backing. Against<br />\nthis may be placed the ideal of an<br />\nundergraduate team \u2014 composed<br />\nof men known by every undergraduate student, gradually building up, through a settled policy of<br />\ndevelopment of raw material, an<br />\naggregation which may meet universities -more suited to the reputation of Johns Hopkins University than the institutions which<br />\nnow hold the center of attention<br />\nin the football schedule. Whether<br />\nthis ideal is attainable, must be<br />\nconsidered separately; judging it<br />\nby the goal alone, THE NEWS-LETTER is of the opinion, and believes<br />\nin that opinion to be voicing the<br />\nsentiment of the great majority<br />\nof Hopkins students, that undergraduate football is infinitely preferable to the present system.<br />\nThe real question, however,'is of<br />\nthat very attainability\u2014whether,<br />\neven if undergraduate football is<br />\nin itself desirable, it is practical.<br />\nAnd by practical is ineant not the<br />\nmere possibility of having an undergraduate team, but the possibility of having a team which<br />\nshall represent its University<br />\nworthily.<br />\nIn this phase of the discussion,<br />\nfirst of all is heard the 6.37, \"But<br />\nundergraduate football was tried<br />\nat Hopkins\u2014and it failed.\" In<br />\nconnection with that cry, the following table of undergraduate enrollments since 1912 may be of<br />\nsome interest:<br />\n200<br />\n1912-13<br />\n263<br />\n1913-14<br />\n289<br />\n1914-15<br />\n393<br />\n1915-16<br />\nIn other words, within four<br />\nyears there has been an increase<br /><br />\nin the undergraduate enrollment<br />\nof almost 100 per cent. Moreover,<br />\nof the 393 undergraduates of this<br />\nyear, 164 were freshmen, which,<br />\nalmost inevitably, means that the<br />\nincrease in the size of the undergraduate department is to be consistently continued.<br />\nThe next question is: Is a body<br />\nof 400 men large enough to enable<br />\na good football team to be built<br />\nup? The answer to this question<br />\nlikewise can be indicated by a<br />\nfew figures. The Haverford team,<br />\nwhich defeated Hopkins this season, was drawn from an enrollment of 195; the Swarthmore<br />\neleven, which, in addition to Hopkins, defeated the University of<br />\nPennsylvania, was built up from<br />\na total undergraduate enrollment<br />\nof 441\u2014and Swarthmore is co-ed.<br />\nBut from these figures immediately arises the query: Granted<br />\nthat there are enough potential<br />\nfootball players at Hopkins to<br />\nform a .good team, would they<br />\ncome out in sufficient 'force to<br />\nmake such a team possible?<br />\nThe query has reference, first,<br />\nof course, to the fact that both<br />\nHaverford and Swarthmore have<br />\ndormitories, while Hopkins has<br />\nnone; that the men at those institutions, by reason of the circumstances in which they are situated, take a more active interest<br />\nin college activities than do Hopkins men. The fact that the presence of dormitories does aid\u2014and<br />\naid materially \u2014 in the development of a football team is incontrovertible. Yet it has been definitely announced that Hopkins<br />\nis to have a dormitory within the<br />\nnear future. Also, the change in<br />\natmosphere produced by the removal to Homewood is unquestioned.<br />\nThis year there were 25 juniors,<br />\nsophomores and freshmen listed<br />\nupon the roll book of the football<br />\nmanager; and, in addition, it is estimated that there were at least<br />\n10 men practicing with the team<br />\nat various times during the season who never definitely enrolled.<br />\nThis would make a nucleus of approximately 35 men upon which to<br />\nbuild an undergraduate team next<br />\nyear, irrespective of the incoming<br />\nclass, and irrespective of the men<br />\nfrom the present three'classes who<br />\nmight come out for a strictly<br />\nundergraduate team when they<br />\nwould not be aroused by the appeal of a, team conducted under<br />\nthe present system. And those<br />\nfacts are as far as anyone can go.<br />\nWhether that nucleus would be<br /><br />\nsufficient, how many men the<br />\nClass of 1921 will furnish for the<br />\nsquad, whether the number of<br />\nthose reporting for practice with<br />\nan undergraduate team who did<br />\nnot come out for the present team<br />\nwill be large or negligible, are all<br />\nquestions which offer wide field<br />\nfor discussion \u2014 questions which<br />\ncan only be answered, in the first<br />\nand last cases, by the men concerned.<br />\nThere is one- very important<br />\nmatter connected with the possibility of undergraduate football,<br />\nhowever, which does permit of<br />\ndefinite anticipation\u2014the matter<br />\nof daylight practice. With undergraduate football, such practice<br />\nwill admittedly be possible\u2014the<br />\nonly question is whether it can<br />\nbe obtained. Daylight practice<br />\ndoes not mean ten or twenty minutes in the twilight; it means the<br />\nrelease of the football - players<br />\nfrom laboratories at some such<br />\ntime as 4 o'clock. It takes no'<br />\ndeep student of football to state<br />\nthat, without such practice, no<br />\nsuccessful team can be developed,<br />\nwhatever, system be employed.<br />\nWith the possibility of such practice, however, which the elimination of graduate students would<br />\ninsure, a determined effort can be<br />\nmade, once for all, to arrange<br />\nsome schedule by which the players can obtain their release at<br />\nsome such time\u2014always with the.<br />\nunderstanding that the work be<br />\nmade up at some other time. If<br />\nthe faculty is both willing and<br />\nable to work out such a schedule,<br />\nit is the opinion of THE NEWSLETTER that undergraduate football can be successful. It is upon<br />\nthis one matter that the whole<br />\nquestion will probably be found<br />\nto hinge.<br />\nThere are three possible alternatives to undergraduate football:<br />\n(a) Delay, (b) a four-year eligibility rule, (c) a three-year elgibility rule.<br />\nThe first of these alternatives<br />\nis in opposition to the feeling<br />\nof the student body. There is a<br />\ngeneral conviction, at the present<br />\ntime, that whatever is going to<br />\n,be done, should be planned now.<br />\nThis does not mean that we should<br />\nnecessatily have undergraduate<br />\nfootball next year, if we are to<br />\nhave it at all; it is easily conceivpble that, should the movement be successful, the Athletic<br />\nAssociation would desire a yearor two leeway in order to develop<br />\nt he system before its definite introduction. But some action should<br /><br />\n5<br />\nbe taken; if Hopkins is going to<br />\nhave undergraduate football, it<br />\nwants to begin work this year; if<br />\nit is not going to have undergraduate football, it must know<br />\nthis year either why it does not<br />\nwant it or why it is not going to<br />\nhave it.<br />\nThe second alternative proposition\u2014a rule providing that no<br />\n'Varsity' player shrould have had<br />\nmore than four years of collegiate<br />\nfootball, wherever those years<br />\nhave been spent\u2014is one which<br />\nseems to have a number of adherents. The objection to this<br />\nplan, however, is that it would<br />\nnot remedy the evil for which it<br />\nwas intended. The great majority<br />\nof colleges have a three-year eligibility rule, due to the fact that<br />\ntheir freshmen are not allowed to<br />\nplay upon 'varsity teams. If Hopkins were to pass a four-year rule,<br />\nit is true it would allow the playing of those graduate students<br />\nwho have not played football at<br />\nother colleges; but, at the same<br />\ntime, it would not prohibit the<br />\nseeking of players among the<br />\ngraduate students of the first<br />\nyear. As a matter of fact, the<br />\nonly change which such a rule<br />\n.would probably make in the present system would be the restriction of the search for ready-developed players to one graduate<br />\nclass, instead of the larger field<br />\nwhich is now available.<br />\nA three-year eligibility rule<br />\nwould probably accomplish the<br />\ndesired end, but it would do so at<br />\nthe sacrifice, for the up-building<br />\nof the team, of all the football<br />\nmaterial which there -happens to<br />\nbe in the Freshman Class \u2014 for<br />\nsuch a rule, of course, depends<br />\nupon the ineligibility of freshmen.<br />\nAt some future time that plan<br />\nmay be adopted, but it cannot be<br />\nadopted at a time when the<br />\nFreshman Class contains almost<br />\none half of the undergraduate enrollment. To develop undergraduate teams, for the first few<br />\nyears, at least, Hopkins will need<br />\nthe services of every available undergraduate.<br />\nIn concluding this discussion,<br />\none fact must be emphasized:<br />\nHopkins should take no step without a full realization of the consequences which that step entails.<br />\nThe question of undergraduate<br />\nfootball must be considered in<br />\nevery possible phase before it is<br />\ndecided one way or the other. It<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1916.<br /><br />\nshould not be swept through<br />\nmerely as a reaction from last<br />\nThursday's defeat; for, however<br />\ngood an argument for some<br />\nehange in system that defeat may<br />\nform, the arguments for and<br />\nagainst undergraduate football<br />\nrest upon bases far deeper than<br />\nthe results of a single game.

In the first<br />\nplace, it is not fair to criticise<br />\nthe medical students who have<br />\ncome out and played, even if they<br />\nhaven't practiced, for practically<br />\nall of them are there, not of their<br />\nown volition, but because it was<br />\nurged that it .was their duty.<br />\nThe other and more serious<br />\npoint is the slight amount of censure which the undergraduate<br />\nstudents received, who were such<br />\npoor sports and had the welfare<br />\nof Hopkins so little at heart that<br />\nthey could not practice clean<br />\nthrough the season, regardless of<br />\nwhether they made the team or<br />\nwhether they were displaced by<br />\nsome med who was not so good<br />\nexcept in reputation.<br />\nNo criticism can be strong<br />\nenough of the chap who is so absorbed in himself that he is unable to make this sacrifice. It<br />\nis folly to talk of an dndergraduate team or any other kind of<br />\nteam while such men are allowed<br />\nto stay in college without being<br />\nmade to realize what pitiful mean<br />\nlittle quitters they are. Every<br />\nman that can play football, if he<br />\nhas at all gotten the real Hopkins<br />\nspirit\u2014give, rather than get\u2014<br />\nought to be willing to practice<br />\nall four years without reward if<br />\nhis services will be of the least<br />\nvalue.<br />\nIn conclusion, I want to make<br />\na suggestion in regard to the daylight practice. It seems to me it<br />\nhas been tackled wrong end fore.<br />\nNow that the laboratories are at<br />\nHomewood and no time is lost in<br />\ntransit, would it not be much<br />\nmore feasible for practice to be<br />\nheld from 1 to 3 o'clock, when<br />\nthere is plenty of sun? Then let<br />\nthe men go to the laboratory until six. In this way no time<br />\nwould be lost and the proposition ought to be regarded much<br />\nmore favorably by the faculty<br />\nthan those which propose cutting<br />\noff an hour in some way or shape<br />\nfrom the football men's time in<br />\nthe laboratory.<br />\nTwo hours (from one to three)<br />\n-of good hard practice under a<br />\ncoach who knew his business and<br />\nwasted no time would be infinitely more valuable than an indefinite period from four until dark<br />\nor moonrise, with the team struggling in by driblets.<br /><br />\n:<br />\nSir\u2014I understand the question<br />\nof football changes is to come up<br />\nin the near future, with the sentiment in favor of an undergraduate team. The four-year rule, it<br />\nseems to me, embodies what<br />\nchange is necessary, and would<br />\nnot exclude the medical or graduate students who come out of<br />\ntheir own free will and work<br />\nequally as hard as the undergraduates. The objection should not<br />\nbe to the meds, as such, but to<br />\nthe coaching spirit which plays<br />\nthem without sufficient practice.<br />\nIf the team is really to represent<br />\nJohns Hopkins University it must<br />\nbe open to these departments, as<br />\nwell as to the undergraduates.<br />\nThe basic difficulty lies in the<br />\nspirit back of the Hopkins football policy. There has apparently<br />\nbeen a desire on the part of the<br />\n\"powers that be\" to get a winning<br />\nteam, regardless of the means.<br />\nTo this end seasoned men have<br />\nbeen wanted, rather than mere<br />\nmaterial. Our lacrosse team-:\u2014<br />\nand, in fact, the teams of most<br />\nother institutions\u2014show that a<br />\ncontinuously successful series of<br />\nteams is not developed that way.<br />\nRather it is a question of training this year by diligent ground<br />\nwork the players that will form<br />\nthe machines of next year and the<br />\nyear after. In that way only can<br />\na policy develop a system that<br />\nwill build a team machine, rather<br />\nthan a collection of individual<br />\nstars hurriedly thrown together<br />\nhelter-skelter and miscalled a<br />\nteam. The material of this year's<br />\nteam, if properly coached throughout an entire season, would undoubtedly have made as good a<br />\nfootball machine as any we have<br />\nhad.<br />\nOur problem is to find a coach<br />\nwho is sufficiently closely connected to us, so that he can build<br />\nkir the future rather than for one<br />\nyear alone. Lack of daylight may<br />\nDONALD K.

But we would prefer<br />\nto fight our ,own battles, though<br />\nthey may be losing ones. To use<br />\na simile which, though perhaps<br />\nexaggerated, nevertheless illustrates the point at issue\u2014we are<br />\nlike the small boy in an uphill<br />\nfight with his neighbor, but who<br />\ncannot help feeling ashamed when<br />\nhis big brother comes to his aid,<br />\nand turns the tide in his favor.<br />\nMoreover, he is subject to the ridicule of his friends, just as we<br />\nhave become the subject of ridicule, not only throughout the rest<br />\nof the State, but in our own city<br />\nof Baltimore.<br />\nOur present system of athletics<br />\nleaves Hopkins' prospects uncertain at the beginning of every season. We never know when we<br /><br />\n1:1<br />\ncan count on the aid of the medical college and graduates. A start<br />\nis made with a few undergraduate martyrs, who, unless they<br />\nshow the form of finished veterans within a short interval of<br />\npractice, are replaced one by one<br />\nby medicos or graduates (dragged<br />\nfrom studies which admittedly<br />\nleave little time for football), who<br />\nhave had long experience in other<br />\nuniversities, and who display<br />\ngreater individual ability than<br />\nthe undergraduates. Not only<br />\nmust these men bk fitted into the<br />\nmachine, however, but this moil<br />\ndifficult work must be carried on<br />\nunder the -handicap of darkness,<br />\nan impediment brought about<br />\nmainly because these very men<br />\nare unable to report early. Again,<br />\n-the presence of these veterans discourages undergraduates of little<br />\nexperience, but who have the makings of stars, from coming out.<br />\nThe coach has nothing to develop<br />\nfor future years, and this, to quote<br />\nthe aptly stated lines of \"Would-<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, DECEMBER 4, 1916.<br />\nBe Rooter,\" forces us to pursue<br />\n, the policy of \"Give us enough<br />\nready-developed men, and we will<br />\nturn out a successful team.\"<br />\nIt has been shown by other<br />\nwriters what other colleges, such<br />\nas Haverford, have accomplished<br />\nwith less material, and we are<br />\nall familiar with the work of St.<br />\nJohn's and other State colleges.<br />\nThere is no reason why we cannot do the same.

Recently they have become<br />\nmore scarce, even at Hopkins.<br />\nThey are, however, not extinct.<br />\nAbout a month ago, after losing<br />\nsome money on a game, an undergraduate friend of mine turned<br />\npessimist; the team did not suit<br />\nhim at all. The following argument gave him temporary relief:<br />\n-\"We do not have a 'big league'<br />\nfootball team because we do not<br />\ngive athletic scholarships or<br />\notherwise commercialize our athletics as most other colleges do,<br />\nbecause our blacklist is notoriously strict, because we lay more<br />\nstress on laboratory work than on<br />\nfootball. We have good reason to<br />\nbe proud of a pcior team.\"<br />\nA week later he had another attack. This was his complaint:<br />\n\"Undergraduates are getting excited over a proposed -change in<br />\nour athletic system. Both the<br />\nchange and the excitement are<br />\ncontrary to all good precedent.\"<br />\nI answered: \"The change does<br />\nnot seem to involve a sacrifice of<br />\nthe true Hopkins standards; its<br />\ndiscussion is a sign of increased<br />\ninterest and should be welcomed<br />\nwith joy.\"<br />\nAgain his disease broke out,this<br />\ntime in a contagious form. He infected me by showing me an advertisement printed by the Hullabaloo board in which the old Hopkins was alluded to as \"the dingy<br />\nbuildings of the past\"\u2014coupled<br />\nwith which is a later statement to<br />\nthe effect that \"Hopkins traditions are nil.\". This time I symphathized with him in earnest.<br />\nI have waited in vain for a protest from the undprgraduate body.<br />\nThe tragedy lies not in the mere<br />\nevidence of shallowness and lack<br />\nof appreciation, but in the fact<br />\nthat the student body permits<br />\nsuch statements to go on record<br />\nunchallenged.
