Although both aggregations<br />\nare mathematically out of the race for<br />\nhonors in the Maryland Collegiate<br />\nLeague, the affair represented more<br />\nthan the usual attempt of one team to<br />\nwin a basketball game at the expense<br />\nof another. Loyola has been the bugaboo of the Blue Jays since the 193334 hardwood season, and their defeat<br />\nwas thus doubly significant.<br />\nTake 7 Point Lead<br />\nThe Malloneemen took a 7 point<br />\nlead in the first three minutes of play,<br />\nand were never as much as tied<br />\nthroughout the contest. At one stage,<br />\nthe home team was behind by 1<br />\ncounter, at another by 14. The visitors<br />\nprovided the margin of victory in<br />\nthe first half, putting away 34<br />\nmarkers to the 21 by the Loyolans.<br />\nThis canto was unusually fast, rough,<br />\nhard on the players, but very interesting to the spectators who jammed<br />\nthe Evergreen gymnasium. The second inning was slower, but was characterized by vicious guarding, long<br />\npop-ups, and more than the ordinary<br />\nrough and tumble element. The Greyhounds forged ahead slightly, to score<br />\n23 points to the 19 netted by the<br />\nJays. A noteworthy feature was the<br />\nfact that 41 foul shots were taken<br />\nduring the game.<br />\nHopkins scored first with Harold<br />\nZheutlin tossing the sphere on a pass<br />\nfrom Bing Cross. Melvin added 5<br />\npoints, to set the total at 7-0. An exchange of long shots, and a shooting<br />\nrampage by Carney, All-State guard,<br />\nput the counters at 13-12. Hopkins<br />\nthen went to town, as it were, scoring<br />\neasily on quick breaks and excellent<br />\npass work. Melvin's overhead shots<br />\nwere particularly effective in this instance, as they are exceedingly difficult to guard against.

Although both aggregations<br />\nare mathematically out of the race for<br />\nhonors in the Maryland Collegiate<br />\nLeague, the affair represented more<br />\nthan the usual attempt of one team to<br />\nwin a basketball game at the expense<br />\nof another. Loyola has been the bugaboo of the Blue Jays since the 193334 hardwood season, and their defeat<br />\nwas thus doubly significant.<br />\nTake 7 Point Lead<br />\nThe Malloneemen took a 7 point<br />\nlead in the first three minutes of play,<br />\nand were never as much as tied<br />\nthroughout the contest. At one stage,<br />\nthe home team was behind by 1<br />\ncounter, at another by 14. The visitors<br />\nprovided the margin of victory in<br />\nthe first half, putting away 34<br />\nmarkers to the 21 by the Loyolans.<br />\nThis canto was unusually fast, rough,<br />\nhard on the players, but very interesting to the spectators who jammed<br />\nthe Evergreen gymnasium. The second inning was slower, but was characterized by vicious guarding, long<br />\npop-ups, and more than the ordinary<br />\nrough and tumble element. The Greyhounds forged ahead slightly, to score<br />\n23 points to the 19 netted by the<br />\nJays. A noteworthy feature was the<br />\nfact that 41 foul shots were taken<br />\nduring the game.<br />\nHopkins scored first with Harold<br />\nZheutlin tossing the sphere on a pass<br />\nfrom Bing Cross. Melvin added 5<br />\npoints, to set the total at 7-0. An exchange of long shots, and a shooting<br />\nrampage by Carney, All-State guard,<br />\nput the counters at 13-12. Hopkins<br />\nthen went to town, as it were, scoring<br />\neasily on quick breaks and excellent<br />\npass work. Melvin's overhead shots<br />\nwere particularly effective in this instance, as they are exceedingly difficult to guard against. Dimmy Traggis substituted for Mel shortly before<br />\nthe first half ended.<br />\nThe last period saw the attempt of<br />\na determined home team to both stem<br />\nthe Hopkins tide of shots, and do some<br />\non their own account, but the score<br />\nset-up in the first part of the game<br />\nwas too much of a handicap.
