Gaither, Republican, and<br />\nIsadore Goldstrom, Democrat,<br />\nDiscuss Question at Fifth Assembly\u2014Presidential<br />\nStraw Vote<br />\nTaken.<br />\n<br />\nThe regular weekly assembly<br />\nlast Thursday was devoted to a<br />\ndiscussion on the League of<br />\nNations. Mr. George R. Gaither<br />\npresented the Republican side of<br />\nthe question and Mr. Isadore<br />\nGoldstrom represented the Democratic viewpoint. The discussion<br />\nwas arranged for and the speakers obtained by the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAlthough the meeting was ostensibly intended as a debate on the<br />\nLeague of Nations, neither speaker confined himself wholly to that<br />\ntopic, but\u2022 paid some attention to<br />\nnearly all the points of difference<br />\nbetween the two parties.<br />\nMr. Gaither, who spoke first, defined what he considered the four<br />\nchief issues of the campaign: A<br />\nreturn to constitutional government and an abandonment of the<br />\npresent \"one-man\" rule, a vigorous<br />\nAmericanism which places the in.<br />\nterests of this country above those<br />\nof the world at large, the placing<br />\nin power of a party with a constructive policy and the League of<br />\nNations. He then proceeded to attack the conditions under which<br />\nthe treaty was written and the<br />\n\"unparalleled orgy of grabbing\"<br />\nwhich took place at Versailles, in<br />\nwhich every nation but the United<br />\nStates had a part. Mr. Gaither<br />\nfurther pointed out that entering<br />\nthe League would mean that we<br />\nguaranteed, under Article X the<br />\nEuropean nations in the possession of the territory thus acquired<br />\nand an abandonment of our traditional policy of isolation.<br />\nIn replying to his opponent Mr.<br />\nGoldstrom touched on a great variety of topics. He called attention to the inefficiency of past<br />\nRepublican administrations, and<br />\ncharacterized their opposition to<br />\nthe treaty and to the League as insincere and partisan. Further he<br />\ncriticised the Republicans for centering their attention on the material prosperity of America alone,<br />\nand ignoring the higher interests<br />\nof the world at large. The League<br />\nhe considers the best method so<br />\nfar advanced for preventing future<br />\nwars, chiefly through the very<br />\nfact.of its existence and the potential might it would represent.<br />\n(Continued on page 7, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER 2, 1920<br />\n<br />\nPRICE 10 CENTS<br />\n<br />\nHARDING WINS E.

Heavily outweighed and supposedly outclassed, they battled the Washingtonians, a team that ranks among<br />\nthe strongest in the East, every<br />\nminute of the game, and forced<br />\nthem to display everything they<br />\nhad in stock to put over their four<br />\ntouchdowns. With the exception<br />\nof the second quarter, when,<br />\nGeorgetown scored 21 points, it<br />\nwas anybody's game, for, despite<br />\nthe magnificent end runs of Flavin<br />\nand Malley, the Hopkins line held<br />\nat the right moments, so that the<br />\nfirst period went scoreless and the<br />\nsecond half gave a touchdown to<br />\neach team.<br />\nTo Bill Wood belongs the glory<br />\nfor doing the thing that Hopkins'<br />\nmost ardent supporters did not<br />\ndare to hope for\u2014scoring a touchdown against the Blue and Gray.<br />\nAlways the first man down the<br />\nfield under a punt, he was ready<br />\nand waiting when Malley signalled<br />\nfor a fair catch and then dropped<br />\nthe ball. With a rush he had<br />\nsnatched up the bounding pikskin<br />\nand was away on a straight dash<br />\nof 40 yards for the goal line, across<br />\nwhich he dived with a Georgetown<br />\nman only a step behind him. Marken kicked goal amid the frenzied<br />\ncheers of the tumultuous Hopkins stands.<br />\nFrom the Georgetown standpoint, the outstanding figures were<br />\nMalley and Flavin. Aided by almost perfect interference, they<br />\ntime and again dashed around the<br />\nHopkins ends for gains of 20 or<br />\n30 yards. On the other side of<br />\nthe line Eric Calkins was in the<br />\nspotlight with his splendid kicking, his 30-yard run through the<br />\nline and his long forward pass,<br />\ncaught by Middleton. To Dodson<br />\nand Gregg much praise is also due<br />\nfor the highly creditable manner<br />\nin which they handled the team.<br />\nDuring the first quarter neither<br />\nsquad showed anything remarkable in the way of an offensive, although Georgetown made several<br />\nlarge gains, the effect of which was<br />\nlost in the remarkable string of<br />\npenalties.

For<br />\nmany years the need of a magazine<br />\nedited by the undergraduates has<br />\nbeen apparent. Every college of<br />\nany standing in the country has<br />\nat least one magazine published<br />\nby the undergraduate body and at<br />\nsome northern colleges as many as<br />\nfive exist.<br />\nMany difficulties are confronted<br />\nin the launching of a new undertaking. This is evident in a college magazine and the actual and<br />\nmoral support of the entire student-body is a prerequisite to success. Considerable interest in the<br />\nnew magazine has been shown as<br />\nis manifested in the large number<br />\nof candidates, 30 in all, for the<br />\neditorial, art and business departments.<br />\nNevertheless, in spite of the<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nPIPE<br />\n<br />\nMANUFACTURERS<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\ngratifying response in the way of<br />\ncontribution, there is an urgent<br />\nneed for more \"copy.\" The editorial board has adopted the<br />\nslogan of \"Get more copy.\" Short<br />\nfictjon, plays, poems, parodies,<br />\nhumorous stories, jokes, cuts having general appeal, as well as cuts<br />\ndepicting college life are in demand. The new magazine affords<br />\nan excellent opportunity to all<br />\nmen qualified, since its nature necessitates a large staff, as is the<br />\ncase with the Harvard Lampoon,<br />\nPrinceton Tiger, Yale Record and<br />\nthe like. The Black and Bluejay<br />\nis a college activity and deserves<br />\nthe support and co-operation of<br />\nthe student-body.

When anyone says that he<br />\nwas a member of the University<br />\nin the \"brick-age\" days he is immediately thought of as an alumnus with gray hair or with a wife<br />\nand family. When the University<br />\nmoved to Homewood in 1916 this<br />\nage ceased and a new era began.<br />\nAnd yet there are still Undergraduates today who took undergraduate courses in the old Monument Street buildings, and hence<br />\nbelong to the \"brick-age\" and who<br />\nare still pursuing courses for a<br />\nB. A. or a B. S. degree today.<br />\nThese men have formed a club<br />\ncalled the Monumental Club. It<br />\nis so small this year that its presence cannot be felt as it should be,<br />\nbut it still stays together to remind and perpetuate the older<br />\nHopkins ideas. Anyone who has<br />\nfailed to enroll and who is interested in the Monumental Club<br />\nshould see Harold Reed, '21.<br />\n<br />\nThe Oratorical Club plans to<br />\nadd mock trials and debates to its<br />\npresent program of extemporaneous and impromptu speaking. The<br />\nmock trials, besides affording an<br />\namusing diversion, will give valuable practice and experience to<br />\nthose who desire to enter the profession of law. The debates will<br />\nbe held by the Oratorical Club<br />\nwith similar clubs of other universities in the near vicinity. Nothing definite has been done in regards to the arrangement of debates, as the approval of the Debating Council, which has not held<br />\na meeting so far this year, is necessary. It is, however, believed by<br />\nsome that a debate could be arranged with Loyola College.<br />\nAn interesting meeting is expected next Friday, when Mr.<br />\nGeorge Goetz will deliver an address on \"Mr. Debs, the Man,\" and<br />\nMr. Debs' political tenets will be<br />\ndiscussed, Mr. Bernard Ades espousing them and Mr. Henry West<br />\nin opposition.

The speaker also referred to three of Butler's works:<br />\n\"Erhewhoii,\" \"Way of All Flesh\"<br />\nand his notebooks.

According<br />\nto the article much of this poor<br />\nrooting is \"caused by the Freshmen who do not know the yells.\"<br />\nIt is perhaps true that the Freshmen are not up to the standard in<br />\nthis respect, but I want to say<br />\nthat the real cause of the trouble<br />\nis not with the Freshmen or any<br />\nof the rooters in general, but with<br />\nthe yell leaders themselves. How<br />\nin the Sam Hill can anybody expect any decent yelling when the<br />\nleaders are never in time with<br />\neach other and one is always a<br />\nhalf an hour behind the other.<br />\nNot only are they out of time with<br />\neach other but the motions of the<br />\ntwo vary so much with respect to<br />\neach other that it would make a<br />\nmonkey cross-eyed if he tried to<br />\nfollow them both. In other words<br />\nthere is an entire lack of co-ordination on their part. Until this<br />\nis remedied you can abuse the<br />\npoor Freshmen without ceasing<br />\nand hold yell practices until<br />\ndoomsday, but the yelling will not<br />\nimprove.<br />\nIn all colleges where the yelling is most effective the yell leaders are trained to act like one machine. They all make the same<br />\nmotions at the same time. The<br />\nvery sight of this harmony of motion and rythm acts in such a way<br />\nas to inspire the rooters to their<br />\nbest endeavor, and cannot fail to<br />\nbring good results.

Mr. George R. Gaither<br />\npresented the Republican side of<br />\nthe question and Mr. Isadore<br />\nGoldstrom represented the Democratic viewpoint. The discussion<br />\nwas arranged for and the speakers obtained by the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAlthough the meeting was ostensibly intended as a debate on the<br />\nLeague of Nations, neither speaker confined himself wholly to that<br />\ntopic, but\u2022 paid some attention to<br />\nnearly all the points of difference<br />\nbetween the two parties.<br />\nMr. Gaither, who spoke first, defined what he considered the four<br />\nchief issues of the campaign: A<br />\nreturn to constitutional government and an abandonment of the<br />\npresent \"one-man\" rule, a vigorous<br />\nAmericanism which places the in.<br />\nterests of this country above those<br />\nof the world at large, the placing<br />\nin power of a party with a constructive policy and the League of<br />\nNations. He then proceeded to attack the conditions under which<br />\nthe treaty was written and the<br />\n\"unparalleled orgy of grabbing\"<br />\nwhich took place at Versailles, in<br />\nwhich every nation but the United<br />\nStates had a part. Mr. Gaither<br />\nfurther pointed out that entering<br />\nthe League would mean that we<br />\nguaranteed, under Article X the<br />\nEuropean nations in the possession of the territory thus acquired<br />\nand an abandonment of our traditional policy of isolation.<br />\nIn replying to his opponent Mr.<br />\nGoldstrom touched on a great variety of topics. He called attention to the inefficiency of past<br />\nRepublican administrations, and<br />\ncharacterized their opposition to<br />\nthe treaty and to the League as insincere and partisan. Further he<br />\ncriticised the Republicans for centering their attention on the material prosperity of America alone,<br />\nand ignoring the higher interests<br />\nof the world at large. The League<br />\nhe considers the best method so<br />\nfar advanced for preventing future<br />\nwars, chiefly through the very<br />\nfact.of its existence and the potential might it would represent.<br />\n(Continued on page 7, col. 3)<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER 2, 1920<br /><br />\nPRICE 10 CENTS<br /><br />\nHARDING WINS E.

Heavily outweighed and supposedly outclassed, they battled the Washingtonians, a team that ranks among<br />\nthe strongest in the East, every<br />\nminute of the game, and forced<br />\nthem to display everything they<br />\nhad in stock to put over their four<br />\ntouchdowns. With the exception<br />\nof the second quarter, when,<br />\nGeorgetown scored 21 points, it<br />\nwas anybody's game, for, despite<br />\nthe magnificent end runs of Flavin<br />\nand Malley, the Hopkins line held<br />\nat the right moments, so that the<br />\nfirst period went scoreless and the<br />\nsecond half gave a touchdown to<br />\neach team.<br />\nTo Bill Wood belongs the glory<br />\nfor doing the thing that Hopkins'<br />\nmost ardent supporters did not<br />\ndare to hope for\u2014scoring a touchdown against the Blue and Gray.<br />\nAlways the first man down the<br />\nfield under a punt, he was ready<br />\nand waiting when Malley signalled<br />\nfor a fair catch and then dropped<br />\nthe ball. With a rush he had<br />\nsnatched up the bounding pikskin<br />\nand was away on a straight dash<br />\nof 40 yards for the goal line, across<br />\nwhich he dived with a Georgetown<br />\nman only a step behind him. Marken kicked goal amid the frenzied<br />\ncheers of the tumultuous Hopkins stands.<br />\nFrom the Georgetown standpoint, the outstanding figures were<br />\nMalley and Flavin. Aided by almost perfect interference, they<br />\ntime and again dashed around the<br />\nHopkins ends for gains of 20 or<br />\n30 yards. On the other side of<br />\nthe line Eric Calkins was in the<br />\nspotlight with his splendid kicking, his 30-yard run through the<br />\nline and his long forward pass,<br />\ncaught by Middleton. To Dodson<br />\nand Gregg much praise is also due<br />\nfor the highly creditable manner<br />\nin which they handled the team.<br />\nDuring the first quarter neither<br />\nsquad showed anything remarkable in the way of an offensive, although Georgetown made several<br />\nlarge gains, the effect of which was<br />\nlost in the remarkable string of<br />\npenalties.

Considerable interest in the<br />\nnew magazine has been shown as<br />\nis manifested in the large number<br />\nof candidates, 30 in all, for the<br />\neditorial, art and business departments.<br />\nNevertheless, in spite of the<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\nPIPE<br /><br />\nMANUFACTURERS<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\ngratifying response in the way of<br />\ncontribution, there is an urgent<br />\nneed for more \"copy.\" The editorial board has adopted the<br />\nslogan of \"Get more copy.\" Short<br />\nfictjon, plays, poems, parodies,<br />\nhumorous stories, jokes, cuts having general appeal, as well as cuts<br />\ndepicting college life are in demand. The new magazine affords<br />\nan excellent opportunity to all<br />\nmen qualified, since its nature necessitates a large staff, as is the<br />\ncase with the Harvard Lampoon,<br />\nPrinceton Tiger, Yale Record and<br />\nthe like. The Black and Bluejay<br />\nis a college activity and deserves<br />\nthe support and co-operation of<br />\nthe student-body. It will arouse<br />\ncollege spirit, keep the University<br />\nadvertised among the largest and<br />\nbest colleges and prep schools in<br />\nthe country, as well as supplying<br />\nentertainment. All copy must be<br />\nturned into Boxes 230 and 125 before November 10th.

When anyone says that he<br />\nwas a member of the University<br />\nin the \"brick-age\" days he is immediately thought of as an alumnus with gray hair or with a wife<br />\nand family. When the University<br />\nmoved to Homewood in 1916 this<br />\nage ceased and a new era began.<br />\nAnd yet there are still Undergraduates today who took undergraduate courses in the old Monument Street buildings, and hence<br />\nbelong to the \"brick-age\" and who<br />\nare still pursuing courses for a<br />\nB. A. or a B. S. degree today.<br />\nThese men have formed a club<br />\ncalled the Monumental Club. It<br />\nis so small this year that its presence cannot be felt as it should be,<br />\nbut it still stays together to remind and perpetuate the older<br />\nHopkins ideas. Anyone who has<br />\nfailed to enroll and who is interested in the Monumental Club<br />\nshould see Harold Reed, '21.<br /><br />\nThe Oratorical Club plans to<br />\nadd mock trials and debates to its<br />\npresent program of extemporaneous and impromptu speaking. The<br />\nmock trials, besides affording an<br />\namusing diversion, will give valuable practice and experience to<br />\nthose who desire to enter the profession of law. The debates will<br />\nbe held by the Oratorical Club<br />\nwith similar clubs of other universities in the near vicinity. Nothing definite has been done in regards to the arrangement of debates, as the approval of the Debating Council, which has not held<br />\na meeting so far this year, is necessary. It is, however, believed by<br />\nsome that a debate could be arranged with Loyola College.<br />\nAn interesting meeting is expected next Friday, when Mr.<br />\nGeorge Goetz will deliver an address on \"Mr. Debs, the Man,\" and<br />\nMr. Debs' political tenets will be<br />\ndiscussed, Mr. Bernard Ades espousing them and Mr. Henry West<br />\nin opposition.

The<br />\nmain event was a talk by Adolphus<br />\nEmmart on Samuel Butler. Emmart treated him not as a scientist<br />\nbut as a man and an author. He<br />\nspoke of his bitterness and extreme cynicism and his lack of<br />\nfaith in life. The speaker also referred to three of Butler's works:<br />\n\"Erhewhoii,\" \"Way of All Flesh\"<br />\nand his notebooks.

According<br />\nto the article much of this poor<br />\nrooting is \"caused by the Freshmen who do not know the yells.\"<br />\nIt is perhaps true that the Freshmen are not up to the standard in<br />\nthis respect, but I want to say<br />\nthat the real cause of the trouble<br />\nis not with the Freshmen or any<br />\nof the rooters in general, but with<br />\nthe yell leaders themselves. How<br />\nin the Sam Hill can anybody expect any decent yelling when the<br />\nleaders are never in time with<br />\neach other and one is always a<br />\nhalf an hour behind the other.<br />\nNot only are they out of time with<br />\neach other but the motions of the<br />\ntwo vary so much with respect to<br />\neach other that it would make a<br />\nmonkey cross-eyed if he tried to<br />\nfollow them both. In other words<br />\nthere is an entire lack of co-ordination on their part. Until this<br />\nis remedied you can abuse the<br />\npoor Freshmen without ceasing<br />\nand hold yell practices until<br />\ndoomsday, but the yelling will not<br />\nimprove.<br />\nIn all colleges where the yelling is most effective the yell leaders are trained to act like one machine. They all make the same<br />\nmotions at the same time. The<br />\nvery sight of this harmony of motion and rythm acts in such a way<br />\nas to inspire the rooters to their<br />\nbest endeavor, and cannot fail to<br />\nbring good results. I do not wish<br />\nto be too hard on the yell leaders<br />\nbecause I know they are working<br />\nhard and trying their best to make<br />\nthe cheers as good as possible.<br />\nThey are going about it in the<br />\nwrong way, however, and will<br />\nnever get good results until they<br />\nthemselves are in perfect co-ordination. I suggest therefore that<br />\nthey have practice among themselves and adopt the method of<br />\nsimultaneous motion which has<br />\nworked so well in other colleges.<br />\nIt is only in this manner that<br />\nHopkins will be unashamed of its<br />\nyelling.<br />\nED HOFFMEISTER.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER STAGES DEBATE<br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 1)<br /><br />\nSTARTS<br />\nORCHESTRA<br />\nREHEARSALS.<br />\nThird Season in Full Swing\u2014Under<br />\nLeadership of Mr. Charles H.<br />\nBochau\u2014Needs Support of<br />\nStudent-Body.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOrchestra, now in its third season,<br />\nhas started its regular weekly rehearsals on Tuesday evenings at<br />\nthe Peabody Institute.<br />\nThe officers of the orchestra are<br />\nstriving to show the benefits of<br />\ntraining in music which will lead<br />\nto the introduction of a Department of Music as a part of the<br />\nUniversity. By admitting outside<br />\nmusicians there is now a complete<br />\nand permanent symphony orchestra with all instruments represented; whereas, with the constantly changing student body and<br />\nlimited number of orchestral players to be found, it would not be<br />\npossible to form a symphony orchestra exclusively of students<br />\nwhich would be in any way permanent,<br />\nLast season the orchestra made<br />\nseveral public appearances, playing at the University Commencement Exercises in February and<br />\nJune, besides giving concerts at<br />\nthe Peabody Institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Maryland Institute<br />\nfor the Blind, the Church Home<br />\nand Infirmary, the Woman's Hospital and St. Agnes' Hospital.<br />\nThough this year's schedule is not<br />\ndefinitely known, it is thought certain that there will be two or more<br />\nout-of-town concerts in addition to<br />\nthese.<br />\nThe encouragement and support<br />\nof the student-body, graduate and<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br /><br />\nRoot, Taft and Hughes all had a<br />\n(THE BOOK MART)<br />\nhand in formulating the covenant,<br />\nCOMPLETE STOCK MEDICAL BOOKS<br />\nyet today they support Harding,<br />\nAND COLLEGE REQUISITES \u2022<br />\nwhom Johnson says is opposed to<br />\nIMPORTERS AND DEALERS IN<br />\nthe League in any form.<br />\nFINE BOOKS<br />\nMuch of the force of the argument was lost in frequent interruptions, cheers, hisses and questions from the audience, which<br />\nseemed to \u2022derive quite a little 301 N.
