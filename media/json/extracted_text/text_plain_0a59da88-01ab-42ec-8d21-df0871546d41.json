Hooker,<br />\nqualifies valid reasons as only<br />\nthose which are outside a<br />\nstudent's control. The \"I\" allows<br />\n<br />\ntime for a student to complete<br />\nwork delayed by illness or serious<br />\npersonal matters.

In the Fall semester of<br />\n1977, 10,680 grades were given<br />\nto undergraduates in the<br />\nDivisions of Arts and Sciences<br />\nand Engineering. Of these, 561<br />\nwere Incompletes. A breakdown<br />\nof the statistics by class shows<br />\nthat 77 were given to freshmen,<br />\n<br />\n120 to sophomores, 140 to<br />\njuniors, and 211 to seniors.<br />\nOf the next semester's grades,<br />\nsimilar numbers of Incompletes<br />\nwere given to freshmen,<br />\nsophomores, and juniors, while<br />\nonly 69 were given to seniors.

This year the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\n<br />\nStudies will explore the matter; it<br />\nplans to make recommendations<br />\nto the faculty and the Academic<br />\nCouncil on possible reforms on<br />\nthe Incomplete system.<br />\nThe means of giving<br />\nIncompletes at Hopkins is<br />\ndescribed as \"unusually liberal,\"<br />\ncompared to other institutions of<br />\nits caliber.

There is nothing at all for students to<br />\ndo to reduce the increase; Dr. Muller himself told the<br />\nCouncil that to allow we who pay tuition to have any input<br />\nconcerning its level would put us in an \"embarrassing<br />\nposition\". He further implied that students should feel<br />\nthemselves fortunate because the increase is so low at a time<br />\nwhen the University is experiencing a budget deficit and<br />\nbecause significant parts of the faculty and Board of<br />\nTrustees ivould like to see an even greater hike. Rising<br />\ntuition, Dr. Muller argues persuasively, is simply inevitable<br />\nin view, of the general financial crunch at the University.<br />\nWhat was lacking in the President's presentation was a<br />\nsense of perspective on the magnitudes involved. The total<br />\namount of new revenue generated by the proposed tuition<br />\nrise will be on the order of $1,800,000. The budget deficit<br />\nlast year amounted to $2,125,000. The fund-raising drive to<br />\nbuild Mudd Hall netted about $6,000,000. Phase ll of the<br />\nMudd complex will require another outlay of around<br />\n$6,000,000. So while the amount involved in the tuition<br />\nincrease is substantial, it is not critical for the University. It<br />\nis, however, a critical amount for students and their<br />\nfamilies, whose budgets do not total $175 million like the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Institutions.<br />\nFor $4,500, the University owes students the best<br />\neducation possible. But all too often, the administration<br />\nneglects matters of great consequence for the quality of<br />\neducation here. The most glaring example of this tendency<br />\nis its \u2022upcoming drive to raise $6 million for Mudd If when<br />\nthe M.S.E. Library is fast entering a serious space crisis.<br />\nAnother questionable move was the launching of the School<br />\nof Engineering, which also requires a large-scale fund-raising<br />\ncampaign. The University has the capacity for obtaining<br />\nfunds by means other than tuition, but its time and energy<br />\nare limited. It should devote its effort to measures that will<br />\nbenefit its students, who must pay through the nose<br />\nwithout any recourse except trusting in the enlightened<br />\nbenevolence of their President and his distinguished<br />\nColleagues on the Board.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nThe recent News-Letter<br />\n\"presentation\" of the South<br />\nAfrican divestment issue is at<br />\nonce a superb example of<br />\nmisrepresentation and a<br />\nremarkably shoddy example of<br />\nsubstantive journalism. As the<br />\nlatter appears to be a chronic<br />\nailment, I will concentrate on the<br />\nformer problem of<br />\nmisrepresentation in an attempt<br />\nto compensate for it.<br />\nMr. Riggs and Mr. Wile have<br />\navoided the substance of both<br />\nthe pragmatic and moral<br />\narguments which have been<br />\nraised regarding divestment.<br />\nInstead they have chosen to<br />\nrecast the divestment argument<br />\nas the \"foolish\" and \"confused\"<br />\neffort of a \"relatively small\"<br />\ngroup. To demonstrate the logic<br />\nof their position Messrs., Riggs<br />\nand Wile, confidently report that<br />\nthe great corporate giants of our<br />\nsociety rest. Therefore, they<br />\ncontinue, divesting the Hopkins<br />\nportfolio would have no<br />\n\"tangible consequences\" on these<br />\nlarge multinationals. While not<br />\nattempting to detract from this<br />\nparticularly incisive deduction, I<br />\nwish to suggest that although this<br />\nassertion might be true in itself,<br />\nit is so abstract from reality as to<br />\nhave little meaning. Both Mr.<br />\nRiggs and Mr. Wile seem<br />\ncompletely oblivious to the fact<br />\nthat the divestment effort is not<br />\nunique to Johns Hopkins. In fact,<br />\nthe issue has come very late to<br />\nthis institution\u2014a fact which is<br />\nprobably not surprising for the<br />\ncynically-minded. It may surprise<br />\novercompctitive and highly demanding institution<br />\nAn<br />\nMessrs.

Students This new proposition posits<br />\nprocrastinate all scinester,take an incomplete, and have all<br />\nmany hundreds of different<br />\nsummer plus six weeks of the next semester to complete institutions, withholding billions,<br />\nof dollars of sorely-needed<br />\ntheir work.

As Bergman said in an interview,<br />\n\"Many of my films are about journeys, about people<br />\ngoing from one place to another.\"<br />\nA trip through the past, Wild Strawberries (1957)<br />\nshows a 76-year-old professor, Dr. Borg (Victor<br />\nSjostrom), travelling to an awards ceremony at which his<br />\nyears of distinguished service will be publicly recognized.<br />\nEncountering different human types\u2014teenage hitchhikers,<br />\na bickering married couple--on the road, the old man<br />\ncompares his life to theirs, but it is his daughter-in-law,<br />\n(Ingrid Thulin) who literally and psychologically drives<br />\nhim, forcing this self-satisfied, complacent man to<br />\nreconsider his entire life.<br />\nShe accuses him of being vain and uncaring; moreover,<br />\nshe attributes her husband's cold nature to his parsh,<br />\nprofession-oriented upbringing. Dr. Borg, deeply affected<br />\nby her comments, daydreams, recalling the family,<br />\nsensations and wild strawberries of his youth. His<br />\nfantasies--and Bergman's camera--leave the bleak,<br />\ndepressing contemporary landscape and travel back to the<br />\npast as lyrical, nostalgic and goosebump-inducing as<br />\nanything Orson Welles conjured up in The Magnificent<br />\nAmbersons.<br />\n<br />\nVictor Sjostrom in Wild Strawberries<br />\n<br />\n'Baltimore Symphony Orchestra<br />\nTaxi Driver Neil Young<br />\n<br />\nSjostrom gives a tremendous performance, his face<br />\ncontaining more lines, landmarks and points of interest<br />\nthan any road map. What adds to our appreciation of his<br />\nhistrionics, however, is the fact that he died not long after<br />\nthe film was completed. Known as Victor Seastrom<br />\nduring his 1923-31 sojourn in Hollywood, Sjostrom made<br />\nat least two silent classics, The Wind and The Scarlet<br />\nLetter.<br />\nOddly enough, Sjostrom, old and tired himself, was<br />\nreluctant to take on the part and only consented when a<br />\nBergman assistant told him, \"All you've got to do is lie<br />\ndown under a tree and munch strawberries and think of<br />\nyour own past, so it won't exactly be hard work.\"<br />\nThankfully, Sjostrom accepted, and proceeded to do<br />\nmuch more than lean against trees and munch<br />\nstrawberries. One cannot imagine a more fitting and<br />\nhonorable end to an admirable film career (arid such a<br />\ncontrast to director Vittoria De Sica's final acting role in<br />\nAndy Worhol's Dracula).<br />\nHis journey to the ceremony and through the past does<br />\nconclude, though without a dramatic answer to the<br />\nquestions raised; rather, an aura of human acceptance and<br />\n<br />\nilip film fit]<br />\nhumility predominates, and what has seemed--at<br />\ntimes--such a gloomy recollection of mortality and<br />\nselfishness, has a less pessimistic conclusion than other<br />\nBergman films.<br />\nTo a greater extent than most Bergman films, he<br />\nShame (1968) comments concerning contemporary<br />\npolitics. Statements about war had been implicit in The<br />\nSilence and would serve as part of the background in his<br />\nnext film, A Passion, but only The Shame deals<br />\nexclusively with war, its devastating human causes and<br />\nconsequences.<br />\n\"The Shame originates in a panicky question,\"<br />\nBergman told an interviewer, explaining the film's<br />\nautobiographical and political origins. \"How would I have<br />\nbehaved during the Nazi period if Sweden had been<br />\noccupied and I'd held some position of responsibility or<br />\nbeen connected with some institution?...How much of the<br />\nfascist are you and I harboring inside ourselves? What sort<br />\nof a situation is needed to turn us from good social<br />\ndemocrats into active Nazis?...The whole (film) was<br />\nprecipitated by documentary film from Vietnam. It didn't<br />\n<br />\nEptertaipmept<br />\n<br />\nshow any war scenes. But it showed the third party to the<br />\nwar.\"<br />\nLike that documentary footage, The Shame deals<br />\nmainly with landscapes littered with dead bodies and<br />\nsurvivors, not active fighters; with third parties, those<br />\npeople who are not directly responsible for war yet must<br />\nsuffer just the same. But who is not responsible, and<br />\nwhere does guilt not extend, Bergman asks.<br />\nThe main characters, Eva and Jan Rosenberg, (Liv<br />\nUllman and Max von Sydow) former musicians now<br />\nselling fruit for a living, are still childless after seven years<br />\nof marriage. Inhabiting an isolated island, they have little<br />\ncontact with the mainland and the civil war raging there.<br />\nBesides, Jan has a bad heart and cannot serve in the army.<br />\nThey are unable, however, to remain in complete<br />\nisolation: trips to the mainland show both the present<br />\nlandscape of death and a city whose 18th century musical<br />\nfigurines remind them of a better life in the past.<br />\nGradually they are pulled into the conflict, debased,<br />\nimplicated, made full of shame.<br />\nShame for their lack of involvement; shame for their<br />\nselfish detachment. But perhaps the ultimate shame is<br />\nGod's, for as a character says,\"What if that person (God)<br />\nshould wake up one morning and be ashamed of what he<br />\nhad done?\" War--Bergman's relentless metaphor for the<br />\nhuman condition--proves all men, and even God, guilty,<br />\nselfish and all too human.<br />\n<br />\nIngmar Bergman<br />\n<br />\nWild Strawberries<br />\n<br />\nSham,<br />\n<br />\nBSO Opens With<br />\nRousing 'Ninth'<br />\n<br />\nYoung: Can't<br />\nGet Enough<br />\nBY MARK CRAWFORD<br />\nAll of this year's reports had led me to believe that Neil<br />\nYoung had put his electric guitars in storage while he<br />\nfinished work on his second movie,\"Human Highway.\"<br />\nSo when I bought my ticket for his concert at the Capital<br />\nCentre last Thursday, I didn't know quite what to expect.<br />\nIt was wild. Though Young's voice sounds more than<br />\never like that of a wounded junky, he was on his feet all<br />\nnight, looking completely healthy and in touch. His stage<br />\ndesign was amusingly wry, and the music--1 just couldn't<br />\nget enough.<br />\nThe event began fittingly with a recording of Jimi<br />\nHendrix's \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" Suddenly, roadies<br />\ndressed up as Sand People from \"Star Wars\" scuttled onto<br />\nthe stage and reenacted Iwo Jima with a I5-foot<br />\nmicrophone stand. At the back of the stage stood four<br />\nhuge boxes which were later hoisted to reveal 20-foot<br />\nFender speaker cabinets. These dwarfed everyone onstage,<br />\nso that from a distance, the whole thing looked rather like<br />\na rock n' roll puppet show. After the national anthem<br />\ncame the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\" and the star<br />\nhimself.<br />\nLying atop a platform next to his 12-string acoustic,<br />\nYoung was caught and awakened by the spotlight. He<br />\nrubbed his eyes, strapped on his guitar and opened with<br />\n\"Sugar Mountain.\" Using a wireless microphone system<br />\nfor his guitar, harmonica and voice, Young roamed the<br />\nstage freely throughout the rest of the acoustic set.<br />\nBesides \"Sugar Mountain,\" \"I Am A Child,\" and \"After<br />\nthe Goldrush,\" Young played several country tunes from<br />\n<br />\nMax Von Sydow in Shame<br />\n<br />\nIi Copeert<br />\nhis forthcoming album, 'Comes A Time. He concluded<br />\nthat set with a new song, \"Out of the Blue and Into the<br />\nBlack,\" which in its simplicity seems to really sum up the<br />\ncurrent condition of rock. It goes: 'My my, hey hey,<br />\nrock'n'roll is here to syaylIt's better to burn out than to<br />\nfade away/ The king is gone but notforgotten/This is the<br />\nstory ofJohnny Rotten...\"<br />\nAfter a short intermission which featured recorded<br />\nstage announcements from Woodstock, Young arid his<br />\nelectric band Crazy Horse took the stage, flying into<br />\nWhen You Dance (I Can Really Love).\" \"The Loner\"<br />\nkept the people on their feet, and from then on time lost<br />\nall meaning.<br />\nYoung is a savage electric guitarist; it's a wonder that<br />\nhe had any strings left after \"Cinnamon Girl.\" The<br />\nelectric set also included a great, banged-up version of the<br />\ncont. on p. 12<br />\n<br />\nBY STEPHEN BARR<br />\nThe Baltimore Symphony Orchestra opened its.1978-9<br />\nconcert season Wednesday evening at the Lyric Theatre<br />\nwith a tremendous performance of Beethoven's<br />\ntradition-shattering Ninth Symphony. Barely averted was<br />\na strike that would have postponed the occasion. The<br />\nmusicians agreed only the night before to a new contract<br />\nwith a $110 weekly pay increase. The performance took<br />\nplace as scheduled and the BSO's performance injected a<br />\nfeeling of celebration that pervaded the evening's festive<br />\nmood.<br />\nThe Ninth Symphony by Beethoven was an appropriate<br />\npiece de resistance for the opening; the piece celebrates<br />\nthe joy of friendship and the brotherhood of man. The<br />\nsymphony climaxes Beethoven's symphonic works, and<br />\nrepresents his final statement on the form of the<br />\nsymphony. During his lifetime, his symphonies<br />\nrevolutionized the forms of Mozart and Handel, and set<br />\nstandards that are still applied today, more than 150 years<br />\nlater. The final movement, in which Beethoven introduces<br />\nSchiller's \"Ode to Joy,\" marks the first time such a choral<br />\nstructure had ever been employed in the symphonic form.<br />\nIn addition, Beethoven (and Schiller) were leaders in the<br />\nRomantic arts movement. The final movement with its<br />\n\"Ode\" possesses a transcendental quality that was not<br />\nonly present for Beethoven, but also for the performance<br />\nWednesday night.<br />\nOne might have expected that after the late-night<br />\nnegotiations the orchestra might be a bit ragged.

In a game marred by bad<br />\nbreaks and costly turnovers, the<br />\nBlue Jays' record slipped to 1-1'<br />\nas they were completely<br />\noverwhelmed by a sudden fourth<br />\nquarter scoring blitz.<br />\nMuhlenberg wasted little time<br />\ngetting on the scoreboard, as<br />\nspeedster Jerry Fahn raced across<br />\nthe goal line from three yards out<br />\nto cap an 80-yard scoring drive..<br />\nDisplaying their exciting new<br />\nHowdy-Myers inspired offense,<br />\nHopkins marched back to tie the<br />\nscore less than a minute later as<br />\nrunning back Bernie Cook hit<br />\nwide receiver Bill Stromberg in<br />\nthe end zone with a halfback<br />\noption pass. The Jays scored<br />\nagain on their next possession as<br />\nkicker Jeff Harris booted a<br />\nthirty-three yard field goal<br />\n\u2022 through the uprights to give the<br />\nBirds a 10-7 first quarter lead.<br />\nDuring the second period the<br />\nMules pulled ahead on a 57-yard<br />\nbomb to junior John Sartori, but<br />\nonce again the Jays bounced<br />\nback, racing 73 yards in three<br />\nplays before Cook found John<br />\nPotthast for a 14-yard<br />\n<br />\ntouchdown pass. Harris added<br />\nthe extra point and, in the next'<br />\nseries, boomed a 45-yard field /<br />\ngoal with less than a minute ,<br />\nremaining to give Hopkins what ,<br />\nappeared to be a secure 20-14 ;<br />\nhalftime lead.<br />\nMuhlenberg was not about to<br />\nbe undone, however, and the<br />\nMules quickly drove I downfield<br />\nas the clock ticked off the final<br />\nseconds for the first half. Despite<br />\na heroic goal-line stand by the<br />\nHo<br />\n. pkins defense, the Mules'<br />\nBrian Bodine battled across the<br />\ngoal line with just five seconds<br />\nremaining. The score was tied at<br />\ntwenty apiece. Kicker Michael<br />\nHiller's extra point put the Mules<br />\nahead at the half, 21-20.<br />\nThe third quarter was<br />\nessentially a standoff, with both<br />\nteams struggling fruitlessly for<br />\nfield position. Finally, with only<br />\nsixteen seconds remaining in the<br />\nperiod, Muhlenberg quarterback<br />\nJohn Schlechter uncorked a<br />\n50-yard bomb for another<br />\nMuhlenberg six. With the score<br />\nstanding -at 28-20 the third<br />\nquarter came to an end, and the<br />\ntwo grid squads headed<br />\ndownfield to begin the final<br />\nperiod.<br />\nIn what has since been dubbed<br />\nby Coach Dennis Cox the most<br />\n\"frantic five minutes\" he has ever<br />\nexperienced in his coaching<br />\ncareer, Saturday's fourth quarter<br />\nwas undoubtedly one of the<br />\nquickest bloodbaths in collegiate<br />\n<br />\nfootball history.<br />\nOn the first play of the period<br />\nthe Jay offense fumbled the ball<br />\naway on their own eleven. Four<br />\nplays later Muhlenberg punched<br />\nthrough the Hopkins defense for<br />\ntheir fifth touchdown. The extra<br />\npoint was good. The score:<br />\n35-20. Time remaining: 13:25.<br />\nThe ensuing kickoff was<br />\nmuffed by the Jays' kick-return<br />\nteam, giving the Mules possession<br />\nagain on the JHU 21. On the first<br />\nplay from scrimmage Schlecter<br />\nhit Sartori again for another six.<br />\nThe score: 49-20. Time<br />\nremaining: 13:18.<br />\nTwo possessions later Mule<br />\ndefensive back Charlie Smith<br />\nsnagged a Margraff pass and<br />\ngalloped 47 yards for yet another<br />\nTD. The score:49-20. Time<br />\nremaining: 11:38.<br />\nOn the ensuing kickoff, the<br />\nBlue Jay returning squad once<br />\nagain lost possession, as<br />\nsophomores Kevin Keefer and<br />\nMart Martello collided with one<br />\nanother while groping for the<br />\nball. This time the Muhlenberg<br />\noffense took only three plays to<br />\nscore, scoring their eighth and<br />\nfinal touchdown with 9:48<br />\nshowing on the stadium clock.<br />\nAlthough the Mules remained<br />\nscoreless for the balance of the<br />\ncontest, the befuddled Blue Jay<br />\noffense could not put together<br />\nanything remotely resembling a<br />\nscoring drive. Quarterback Jim<br />\nMa rgraff hurled seven<br />\n<br />\nquarter lead, but a last-second<br />\nMule score at the close of the<br />\nsecond period kept Hopkins from<br />\ncarrying their lead into the locker<br />\nroom at half time.<br />\nIn the third quarter both<br />\nteams dug in and held fast in a<br />\nperiod punctuated by a plethora<br />\nof penalties. But once again<br />\nMuhlenberg broke loose and<br />\nscored with just seconds showing<br />\non the clock, paving the way for<br />\nthe unbelievable fourth quarter<br />\ndrubbing.<br />\nPerhaps more important than<br />\nthe magnitude of last Saturday's<br />\nloss were the injuries sustained<br />\nin the course of the contest.<br />\nSenior tackle Todd Hathaway<br />\nsuffered a bruised shoulder in the<br />\nmelee, and now looks<br />\nquestionable for tomorrow's<br />\nhome game against Franklin and<br />\nMarshall.<br />\n\"It's really too bad,\" lamented<br />\nfreshman stalwart Dave Bellinger,<br />\nthe other tackle on the offensive<br />\nline. \"Todd was having an<br />\nextremely good game when he<br />\ngot hit.\"<br />\nWide receiver Tom Bender is<br />\nalso out with an injured shoulder,<br />\nbut will probably return to the<br />\nBlue Jay lineup in the very near<br />\nfuture.

There is nothing at all for students to<br />\ndo to reduce the increase; Dr. Muller himself told the<br />\nCouncil that to allow we who pay tuition to have any input<br />\nconcerning its level would put us in an \"embarrassing<br />\nposition\". He further implied that students should feel<br />\nthemselves fortunate because the increase is so low at a time<br />\nwhen the University is experiencing a budget deficit and<br />\nbecause significant parts of the faculty and Board of<br />\nTrustees ivould like to see an even greater hike. Rising<br />\ntuition, Dr. Muller argues persuasively, is simply inevitable<br />\nin view, of the general financial crunch at the University.<br />\nWhat was lacking in the President's presentation was a<br />\nsense of perspective on the magnitudes involved. The total<br />\namount of new revenue generated by the proposed tuition<br />\nrise will be on the order of $1,800,000. The budget deficit<br />\nlast year amounted to $2,125,000. The fund-raising drive to<br />\nbuild Mudd Hall netted about $6,000,000. Phase ll of the<br />\nMudd complex will require another outlay of around<br />\n$6,000,000. So while the amount involved in the tuition<br />\nincrease is substantial, it is not critical for the University. It<br />\nis, however, a critical amount for students and their<br />\nfamilies, whose budgets do not total $175 million like the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Institutions.<br />\nFor $4,500, the University owes students the best<br />\neducation possible. But all too often, the administration<br />\nneglects matters of great consequence for the quality of<br />\neducation here. The most glaring example of this tendency<br />\nis its \u2022upcoming drive to raise $6 million for Mudd If when<br />\nthe M.S.E. Library is fast entering a serious space crisis.<br />\nAnother questionable move was the launching of the School<br />\nof Engineering, which also requires a large-scale fund-raising<br />\ncampaign. The University has the capacity for obtaining<br />\nfunds by means other than tuition, but its time and energy<br />\nare limited. It should devote its effort to measures that will<br />\nbenefit its students, who must pay through the nose<br />\nwithout any recourse except trusting in the enlightened<br />\nbenevolence of their President and his distinguished<br />\nColleagues on the Board.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nThe recent News-Letter<br />\n\"presentation\" of the South<br />\nAfrican divestment issue is at<br />\nonce a superb example of<br />\nmisrepresentation and a<br />\nremarkably shoddy example of<br />\nsubstantive journalism. As the<br />\nlatter appears to be a chronic<br />\nailment, I will concentrate on the<br />\nformer problem of<br />\nmisrepresentation in an attempt<br />\nto compensate for it.<br />\nMr. Riggs and Mr. Wile have<br />\navoided the substance of both<br />\nthe pragmatic and moral<br />\narguments which have been<br />\nraised regarding divestment.<br />\nInstead they have chosen to<br />\nrecast the divestment argument<br />\nas the \"foolish\" and \"confused\"<br />\neffort of a \"relatively small\"<br />\ngroup. To demonstrate the logic<br />\nof their position Messrs., Riggs<br />\nand Wile, confidently report that<br />\nthe great corporate giants of our<br />\nsociety rest. Therefore, they<br />\ncontinue, divesting the Hopkins<br />\nportfolio would have no<br />\n\"tangible consequences\" on these<br />\nlarge multinationals. While not<br />\nattempting to detract from this<br />\nparticularly incisive deduction, I<br />\nwish to suggest that although this<br />\nassertion might be true in itself,<br />\nit is so abstract from reality as to<br />\nhave little meaning. Both Mr.<br />\nRiggs and Mr. Wile seem<br />\ncompletely oblivious to the fact<br />\nthat the divestment effort is not<br />\nunique to Johns Hopkins. In fact,<br />\nthe issue has come very late to<br />\nthis institution\u2014a fact which is<br />\nprobably not surprising for the<br />\ncynically-minded.

As Bergman said in an interview,<br />\n\"Many of my films are about journeys, about people<br />\ngoing from one place to another.\"<br />\nA trip through the past, Wild Strawberries (1957)<br />\nshows a 76-year-old professor, Dr. Borg (Victor<br />\nSjostrom), travelling to an awards ceremony at which his<br />\nyears of distinguished service will be publicly recognized.<br />\nEncountering different human types\u2014teenage hitchhikers,<br />\na bickering married couple--on the road, the old man<br />\ncompares his life to theirs, but it is his daughter-in-law,<br />\n(Ingrid Thulin) who literally and psychologically drives<br />\nhim, forcing this self-satisfied, complacent man to<br />\nreconsider his entire life.<br />\nShe accuses him of being vain and uncaring; moreover,<br />\nshe attributes her husband's cold nature to his parsh,<br />\nprofession-oriented upbringing. Dr. Borg, deeply affected<br />\nby her comments, daydreams, recalling the family,<br />\nsensations and wild strawberries of his youth. His<br />\nfantasies--and Bergman's camera--leave the bleak,<br />\ndepressing contemporary landscape and travel back to the<br />\npast as lyrical, nostalgic and goosebump-inducing as<br />\nanything Orson Welles conjured up in The Magnificent<br />\nAmbersons.<br /><br />\nVictor Sjostrom in Wild Strawberries<br /><br />\n'Baltimore Symphony Orchestra<br />\nTaxi Driver Neil Young<br /><br />\nSjostrom gives a tremendous performance, his face<br />\ncontaining more lines, landmarks and points of interest<br />\nthan any road map. What adds to our appreciation of his<br />\nhistrionics, however, is the fact that he died not long after<br />\nthe film was completed. Known as Victor Seastrom<br />\nduring his 1923-31 sojourn in Hollywood, Sjostrom made<br />\nat least two silent classics, The Wind and The Scarlet<br />\nLetter.<br />\nOddly enough, Sjostrom, old and tired himself, was<br />\nreluctant to take on the part and only consented when a<br />\nBergman assistant told him, \"All you've got to do is lie<br />\ndown under a tree and munch strawberries and think of<br />\nyour own past, so it won't exactly be hard work.\"<br />\nThankfully, Sjostrom accepted, and proceeded to do<br />\nmuch more than lean against trees and munch<br />\nstrawberries. One cannot imagine a more fitting and<br />\nhonorable end to an admirable film career (arid such a<br />\ncontrast to director Vittoria De Sica's final acting role in<br />\nAndy Worhol's Dracula).<br />\nHis journey to the ceremony and through the past does<br />\nconclude, though without a dramatic answer to the<br />\nquestions raised; rather, an aura of human acceptance and<br /><br />\nilip film fit]<br />\nhumility predominates, and what has seemed--at<br />\ntimes--such a gloomy recollection of mortality and<br />\nselfishness, has a less pessimistic conclusion than other<br />\nBergman films.<br />\nTo a greater extent than most Bergman films, he<br />\nShame (1968) comments concerning contemporary<br />\npolitics. Statements about war had been implicit in The<br />\nSilence and would serve as part of the background in his<br />\nnext film, A Passion, but only The Shame deals<br />\nexclusively with war, its devastating human causes and<br />\nconsequences.<br />\n\"The Shame originates in a panicky question,\"<br />\nBergman told an interviewer, explaining the film's<br />\nautobiographical and political origins. \"How would I have<br />\nbehaved during the Nazi period if Sweden had been<br />\noccupied and I'd held some position of responsibility or<br />\nbeen connected with some institution?...How much of the<br />\nfascist are you and I harboring inside ourselves? What sort<br />\nof a situation is needed to turn us from good social<br />\ndemocrats into active Nazis?...The whole (film) was<br />\nprecipitated by documentary film from Vietnam. It didn't<br /><br />\nEptertaipmept<br /><br />\nshow any war scenes. But it showed the third party to the<br />\nwar.\"<br />\nLike that documentary footage, The Shame deals<br />\nmainly with landscapes littered with dead bodies and<br />\nsurvivors, not active fighters; with third parties, those<br />\npeople who are not directly responsible for war yet must<br />\nsuffer just the same. But who is not responsible, and<br />\nwhere does guilt not extend, Bergman asks.<br />\nThe main characters, Eva and Jan Rosenberg, (Liv<br />\nUllman and Max von Sydow) former musicians now<br />\nselling fruit for a living, are still childless after seven years<br />\nof marriage. Inhabiting an isolated island, they have little<br />\ncontact with the mainland and the civil war raging there.<br />\nBesides, Jan has a bad heart and cannot serve in the army.<br />\nThey are unable, however, to remain in complete<br />\nisolation: trips to the mainland show both the present<br />\nlandscape of death and a city whose 18th century musical<br />\nfigurines remind them of a better life in the past.<br />\nGradually they are pulled into the conflict, debased,<br />\nimplicated, made full of shame.<br />\nShame for their lack of involvement; shame for their<br />\nselfish detachment. But perhaps the ultimate shame is<br />\nGod's, for as a character says,\"What if that person (God)<br />\nshould wake up one morning and be ashamed of what he<br />\nhad done?\" War--Bergman's relentless metaphor for the<br />\nhuman condition--proves all men, and even God, guilty,<br />\nselfish and all too human.<br /><br />\nIngmar Bergman<br /><br />\nWild Strawberries<br /><br />\nSham,<br /><br />\nBSO Opens With<br />\nRousing 'Ninth'<br /><br />\nYoung: Can't<br />\nGet Enough<br />\nBY MARK CRAWFORD<br />\nAll of this year's reports had led me to believe that Neil<br />\nYoung had put his electric guitars in storage while he<br />\nfinished work on his second movie,\"Human Highway.\"<br />\nSo when I bought my ticket for his concert at the Capital<br />\nCentre last Thursday, I didn't know quite what to expect.<br />\nIt was wild. Though Young's voice sounds more than<br />\never like that of a wounded junky, he was on his feet all<br />\nnight, looking completely healthy and in touch. His stage<br />\ndesign was amusingly wry, and the music--1 just couldn't<br />\nget enough.<br />\nThe event began fittingly with a recording of Jimi<br />\nHendrix's \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" Suddenly, roadies<br />\ndressed up as Sand People from \"Star Wars\" scuttled onto<br />\nthe stage and reenacted Iwo Jima with a I5-foot<br />\nmicrophone stand. At the back of the stage stood four<br />\nhuge boxes which were later hoisted to reveal 20-foot<br />\nFender speaker cabinets. These dwarfed everyone onstage,<br />\nso that from a distance, the whole thing looked rather like<br />\na rock n' roll puppet show. After the national anthem<br />\ncame the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\" and the star<br />\nhimself.<br />\nLying atop a platform next to his 12-string acoustic,<br />\nYoung was caught and awakened by the spotlight. He<br />\nrubbed his eyes, strapped on his guitar and opened with<br />\n\"Sugar Mountain.\" Using a wireless microphone system<br />\nfor his guitar, harmonica and voice, Young roamed the<br />\nstage freely throughout the rest of the acoustic set.<br />\nBesides \"Sugar Mountain,\" \"I Am A Child,\" and \"After<br />\nthe Goldrush,\" Young played several country tunes from<br /><br />\nMax Von Sydow in Shame<br /><br />\nIi Copeert<br />\nhis forthcoming album, 'Comes A Time. He concluded<br />\nthat set with a new song, \"Out of the Blue and Into the<br />\nBlack,\" which in its simplicity seems to really sum up the<br />\ncurrent condition of rock. It goes: 'My my, hey hey,<br />\nrock'n'roll is here to syaylIt's better to burn out than to<br />\nfade away/ The king is gone but notforgotten/This is the<br />\nstory ofJohnny Rotten...\"<br />\nAfter a short intermission which featured recorded<br />\nstage announcements from Woodstock, Young arid his<br />\nelectric band Crazy Horse took the stage, flying into<br />\nWhen You Dance (I Can Really Love).\" \"The Loner\"<br />\nkept the people on their feet, and from then on time lost<br />\nall meaning.<br />\nYoung is a savage electric guitarist; it's a wonder that<br />\nhe had any strings left after \"Cinnamon Girl.\" The<br />\nelectric set also included a great, banged-up version of the<br />\ncont. on p. 12<br /><br />\nBY STEPHEN BARR<br />\nThe Baltimore Symphony Orchestra opened its.1978-9<br />\nconcert season Wednesday evening at the Lyric Theatre<br />\nwith a tremendous performance of Beethoven's<br />\ntradition-shattering Ninth Symphony. Barely averted was<br />\na strike that would have postponed the occasion. The<br />\nmusicians agreed only the night before to a new contract<br />\nwith a $110 weekly pay increase. The performance took<br />\nplace as scheduled and the BSO's performance injected a<br />\nfeeling of celebration that pervaded the evening's festive<br />\nmood.<br />\nThe Ninth Symphony by Beethoven was an appropriate<br />\npiece de resistance for the opening; the piece celebrates<br />\nthe joy of friendship and the brotherhood of man. The<br />\nsymphony climaxes Beethoven's symphonic works, and<br />\nrepresents his final statement on the form of the<br />\nsymphony. During his lifetime, his symphonies<br />\nrevolutionized the forms of Mozart and Handel, and set<br />\nstandards that are still applied today, more than 150 years<br />\nlater. The final movement, in which Beethoven introduces<br />\nSchiller's \"Ode to Joy,\" marks the first time such a choral<br />\nstructure had ever been employed in the symphonic form.<br />\nIn addition, Beethoven (and Schiller) were leaders in the<br />\nRomantic arts movement. The final movement with its<br />\n\"Ode\" possesses a transcendental quality that was not<br />\nonly present for Beethoven, but also for the performance<br />\nWednesday night.<br />\nOne might have expected that after the late-night<br />\nnegotiations the orchestra might be a bit ragged.

In a game marred by bad<br />\nbreaks and costly turnovers, the<br />\nBlue Jays' record slipped to 1-1'<br />\nas they were completely<br />\noverwhelmed by a sudden fourth<br />\nquarter scoring blitz.<br />\nMuhlenberg wasted little time<br />\ngetting on the scoreboard, as<br />\nspeedster Jerry Fahn raced across<br />\nthe goal line from three yards out<br />\nto cap an 80-yard scoring drive..<br />\nDisplaying their exciting new<br />\nHowdy-Myers inspired offense,<br />\nHopkins marched back to tie the<br />\nscore less than a minute later as<br />\nrunning back Bernie Cook hit<br />\nwide receiver Bill Stromberg in<br />\nthe end zone with a halfback<br />\noption pass. The Jays scored<br />\nagain on their next possession as<br />\nkicker Jeff Harris booted a<br />\nthirty-three yard field goal<br />\n\u2022 through the uprights to give the<br />\nBirds a 10-7 first quarter lead.<br />\nDuring the second period the<br />\nMules pulled ahead on a 57-yard<br />\nbomb to junior John Sartori, but<br />\nonce again the Jays bounced<br />\nback, racing 73 yards in three<br />\nplays before Cook found John<br />\nPotthast for a 14-yard<br /><br />\ntouchdown pass. Harris added<br />\nthe extra point and, in the next'<br />\nseries, boomed a 45-yard field /<br />\ngoal with less than a minute ,<br />\nremaining to give Hopkins what ,<br />\nappeared to be a secure 20-14 ;<br />\nhalftime lead.<br />\nMuhlenberg was not about to<br />\nbe undone, however, and the<br />\nMules quickly drove I downfield<br />\nas the clock ticked off the final<br />\nseconds for the first half. Despite<br />\na heroic goal-line stand by the<br />\nHo<br />\n. pkins defense, the Mules'<br />\nBrian Bodine battled across the<br />\ngoal line with just five seconds<br />\nremaining. The score was tied at<br />\ntwenty apiece. Kicker Michael<br />\nHiller's extra point put the Mules<br />\nahead at the half, 21-20.<br />\nThe third quarter was<br />\nessentially a standoff, with both<br />\nteams struggling fruitlessly for<br />\nfield position. Finally, with only<br />\nsixteen seconds remaining in the<br />\nperiod, Muhlenberg quarterback<br />\nJohn Schlechter uncorked a<br />\n50-yard bomb for another<br />\nMuhlenberg six. With the score<br />\nstanding -at 28-20 the third<br />\nquarter came to an end, and the<br />\ntwo grid squads headed<br />\ndownfield to begin the final<br />\nperiod.<br />\nIn what has since been dubbed<br />\nby Coach Dennis Cox the most<br />\n\"frantic five minutes\" he has ever<br />\nexperienced in his coaching<br />\ncareer, Saturday's fourth quarter<br />\nwas undoubtedly one of the<br />\nquickest bloodbaths in collegiate<br /><br />\nfootball history.<br />\nOn the first play of the period<br />\nthe Jay offense fumbled the ball<br />\naway on their own eleven. Four<br />\nplays later Muhlenberg punched<br />\nthrough the Hopkins defense for<br />\ntheir fifth touchdown. The extra<br />\npoint was good. The score:<br />\n35-20. Time remaining: 13:25.<br />\nThe ensuing kickoff was<br />\nmuffed by the Jays' kick-return<br />\nteam, giving the Mules possession<br />\nagain on the JHU 21. On the first<br />\nplay from scrimmage Schlecter<br />\nhit Sartori again for another six.<br />\nThe score: 49-20. Time<br />\nremaining: 13:18.<br />\nTwo possessions later Mule<br />\ndefensive back Charlie Smith<br />\nsnagged a Margraff pass and<br />\ngalloped 47 yards for yet another<br />\nTD. The score:49-20. Time<br />\nremaining: 11:38.<br />\nOn the ensuing kickoff, the<br />\nBlue Jay returning squad once<br />\nagain lost possession, as<br />\nsophomores Kevin Keefer and<br />\nMart Martello collided with one<br />\nanother while groping for the<br />\nball. This time the Muhlenberg<br />\noffense took only three plays to<br />\nscore, scoring their eighth and<br />\nfinal touchdown with 9:48<br />\nshowing on the stadium clock.<br />\nAlthough the Mules remained<br />\nscoreless for the balance of the<br />\ncontest, the befuddled Blue Jay<br />\noffense could not put together<br />\nanything remotely resembling a<br />\nscoring drive. Quarterback Jim<br />\nMa rgraff hurled seven<br /><br />\nquarter lead, but a last-second<br />\nMule score at the close of the<br />\nsecond period kept Hopkins from<br />\ncarrying their lead into the locker<br />\nroom at half time.<br />\nIn the third quarter both<br />\nteams dug in and held fast in a<br />\nperiod punctuated by a plethora<br />\nof penalties. But once again<br />\nMuhlenberg broke loose and<br />\nscored with just seconds showing<br />\non the clock, paving the way for<br />\nthe unbelievable fourth quarter<br />\ndrubbing.<br />\nPerhaps more important than<br />\nthe magnitude of last Saturday's<br />\nloss were the injuries sustained<br />\nin the course of the contest.<br />\nSenior tackle Todd Hathaway<br />\nsuffered a bruised shoulder in the<br />\nmelee, and now looks<br />\nquestionable for tomorrow's<br />\nhome game against Franklin and<br />\nMarshall.<br />\n\"It's really too bad,\" lamented<br />\nfreshman stalwart Dave Bellinger,<br />\nthe other tackle on the offensive<br />\nline. \"Todd was having an<br />\nextremely good game when he<br />\ngot hit.\"<br />\nWide receiver Tom Bender is<br />\nalso out with an injured shoulder,<br />\nbut will probably return to the<br />\nBlue Jay lineup in the very near<br />\nfuture.
