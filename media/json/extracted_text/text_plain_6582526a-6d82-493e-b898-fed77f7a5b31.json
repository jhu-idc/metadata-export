While the legislation was passed<br />\nmore than two years ago, the issue remains<br />\na sticky one for colleges and universities<br />\nthroughout the state. This is due to the fact<br />\nthat, for the first time, the majority of college undergraduates are underage.<br />\nColleges are faced with the responsibility<br />\nto adopt regulations which reflect their interpretation of the drinking age law. Some<br />\ninstitutions have chosen to ban alcohol from<br />\nall campus events. Others have elected to retain drinking policies already in existence.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University administration has maintained that all universityaffiliated functions will uphold the law.<br />\nThis is an admirable stance, but not a simple one. True, the university must obey the<br />\nlaw. Yet, at the same time, it must accomodate those students who may legally drink.<br />\nRather than eliminating alcohol entirely, the<br />\nadministration should solicit student input<br />\nin search of a mutually acceptable policy.<br />\nIt seems there has been definite progress<br />\nin this direction. Meetings have been scheduled with interested students and groups, in-<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\n<br />\ncluding class officers and the inter-fraternity<br />\ncouncil. Such action is commendable and<br />\nshould be supported strongly.<br />\nSome individuals and organizations,<br />\nhowever, continue to oppose adherence to<br />\nthe law. They feel that the university should<br />\ncondone drinking, or at least merely ignore<br />\nit. Their principal reason is the fact that<br />\nunderage students will drink, regardless of<br />\nregulations. Additionally, they maintain that<br />\nstudents will be forced off campus in search<br />\nof liquor and, if access to a car is available,<br />\nthe initial purpose of the law, the prevention<br />\nof drunken driving, will be subverted.<br />\nThese are substantial claims and must be<br />\nconsidered seriously. It is doubtful that the<br />\nadministration believes that students will not<br />\ndrink merely because a law exists against it.<br />\nAlcohol is traditionally an integral part of<br />\nthe college experience, especially at Hopkins.<br />\nNevertheless, the decision to drink or to drive<br />\nafter drinking is an individual one. We, as<br />\nadults, must accept the responsibility for our<br />\nactions.<br />\nJohns Hopkins, however, has a much<br />\nbroader responsibility. An institution cannot espouse maturity and integrity and, at<br />\nthe same time, assist its constituents in<br />\ndisregarding the law, either blatantly or<br />\nsurreptitiously.<br />\n<br />\nand probably at an increased<br />\npower.<br />\nThat was the last that we<br />\nheard on the subject until last<br />\nweek's Newsletter came out.<br />\nThere, on the front page, was<br />\nthe news I had waited so long<br />\nfor\u2014\"WJHU to Return After<br />\nYear Off Air.\"<br />\nBut elation quickly turned to<br />\nyet another disappointment<br />\nwhen I read that WJHU won't<br />\nbe student-run anymore. Why?<br />\nDoes the university feel that its<br />\nstudents can't handle the<br />\nresponsibiltiy anymore?<br />\nI think it's time for another<br />\nWJHU staff meeting. It's time<br />\nfor the administration to provide some answers to those of<br />\nus who cared about the radio<br />\nstation. For starters, why do<br />\nthey feel a professional station<br />\nmanager is needed? Why<br />\nwasn't WJHU reopened on<br />\nschedule two monthe ago\u2014was<br />\nthere a serious, unforeseen problem, or just procrastination?<br />\nAnd most importantly, will we,<br />\nthe students, have any say indetermining the programming?<br />\nCan we once again be DJs and<br />\nengineers and newscasters and<br />\nsportscasters, or will our only<br />\nway of \"getting involved\" in<br />\nWJHU be to file records in the<br />\nrecord library as the professionals take over the airwaves?<br />\nI would like to ask the administration to call the staff of<br />\nWJHU together once more,<br />\nprovide us with some answers<br />\nand explanations, and then<br />\nopen it up for questions. Yes,<br />\nsome resentment may come<br />\npouring out, but that's<br />\nunderstandable, given the<br />\ncircumstances.<br />\nWJHU was an important<br />\npart of my life last year and I<br />\nthoroughly enjoyed my experience on the staff. Before<br />\nWJHU comes back, I, and undoubtedly many other, want to<br />\nbe reassured that we'll still have<br />\na place there, and that we'll<br />\nhave a say in the station's<br />\nfuture.<br />\n<br />\nwhich the WJHU situation has<br />\nbeen handled can only be called disgusting. The student and<br />\ncommunity members of the station have been used by the administration, only to be left out<br />\nof the final decision-making<br />\nprocess. The last straw was the<br />\nactive students finding out<br />\nabout the station's fate in the<br />\nNews-Letter. The least that Dr.<br />\nMuller could have done was to<br />\ncall a staff meeting at which the<br />\nnew plans could be presented.<br />\nInstead, we were ignored for<br />\nfive months from the time that<br />\nstation left the air on April 1<br />\nuntil the N-L article last week.<br />\nOver the years, WJHU has<br />\ndeveloped a reputation as one<br />\nof the finest student operated<br />\nradio stations in the country.<br />\nBaltimore Magazine even<br />\nrecognized it as 'Baltimore's<br />\nBest Radio Station' several<br />\nyears ago. With few exceptions,<br />\nthe staff exhibited extraordinary professionalism on the<br />\nair, a service which the community appreciated. Even when<br />\nwe wondered whether or not<br />\nanyone was really listening, we<br />\nstayed on the air through<br />\nmiserable weather, exam<br />\nperiods, vacations and<br />\nholidays. When we did go off<br />\nthe air, we were deluged with<br />\nmail and calls from all of the<br />\npeople who missed us. When<br />\nwere there, they took us for<br />\ngranted. Now that we're gone,<br />\nwe're sorely missed. The<br />\nFederal Communications Commission found our record to be<br />\ngood enough to warrant an increase in our broadcast power<br />\nby 2500 times.<br />\nThe approval for the boost to<br />\n25 kilowatts was granted in<br />\nAugust of 1983. From the moment that the permit was received, the station management was<br />\nput to work gathering information and making plans for the<br />\nnew facilities which would be<br />\nneeded. Even as this was happening however, the staff<br />\nmembers, aware of what was<br />\ngoing on, were sworn to secrecy<br />\nabout the permit, even though<br />\nit is legally a matter of public<br />\nrecord. The Managing Board<br />\ncontinued for seven months to<br />\nmeet with the administration,<br />\npresenting their plans and<br />\nanswering questions.

Weiser's<br />\ntitle, Injustice at Rosebud,<br />\nbecomes a polite understatement in contrast to the gross<br />\nlack of human compassion that<br />\nexists. His article points out the<br />\nconsignment of a whole ethnic<br />\ngroup, a Sioux tribe, to<br />\nsubhuman status. In the first<br />\ntwo installments of the series,<br />\nthe readership of the Post<br />\nlearned that \"seven of every 10<br />\njobless,\"<br />\nSioux<br />\nare<br />\n\"some....live in shacks and old<br />\ncars,\" that its physicians are<br />\nlargely \"...unfit, unqualified,<br />\nunsuitable, and in some cases,<br />\nunlicensed...,\" that violence,<br />\npoverty, disease, and squalor<br />\nare \"intense.\" Further description of the situation at Rosebud<br />\nin this article would be needless<br />\nduplication; Weiser's series<br />\nshould be read closely by any<br />\ninterested readers. What is very<br />\nimportant about these articles is<br />\nthe broader problem that<br />\nbecomes apparent: the fact that<br />\nRosebud, while it is \"....not<br />\ntypical of America's 265 Indian<br />\nreservations...,\" stands as<br />\n<br />\n....a chilling example of what<br />\ncan happen in this country<br />\nwhen the most basic civil liberties and essential institutions do<br />\nnot exist or are allowed to<br />\ndeteriorate.\"<br />\nWhat happens when we<br />\nunderstand that groups of U.S.<br />\ncitizens like the Sioux are<br />\ndenied the fundamental rights<br />\nof which Americans are so<br />\nproud? A basic, almost naive<br />\nassumption can be made: the<br />\nAmerican political system does<br />\nnot work for all its citizens. For<br />\nsome, the patriotic, flag-waving<br />\nmentality that pervades an election year becomes somewhat<br />\nmore than hollow. However,<br />\nmany of the people who<br />\nbecome concerned about<br />\ndiscrimination and civil rights<br />\nviolations, those very people<br />\nwho have the capability to actually do something to help oppressed and disadvantaged people, invariably lapse into<br />\ncynicism. It seems to be the<br />\npopular attitude to have; it is<br />\npopular to be a \"lost generation\" person. The pervading attitude is to ignore politics, to<br />\nsay that all politicians are<br />\nworthless sycophants of one<br />\nspecial interest group or<br />\nanother. Although it is true that<br />\nmany voters must choose \"the<br />\nlesser evil\" when participating<br />\nin an election, is it impossible<br />\nto choose a candidate who at<br />\nleast appears to favor aid and<br />\n<br />\njustice for groups like the Indians of Rosebud? Is it unlikely that a person who truly<br />\nbelieves in \"justice for all\"<br />\ncould be found, no matter how<br />\nlong it takes? A vote in<br />\nNovember's general election is<br />\nthe very least that any concerned voter should give, if he or<br />\nshe really hopes to change the<br />\ninequities of society.<br />\nIs there more that anyone<br />\ncan do to change the conditions<br />\nof life for the disadvantaged? It<br />\nis ridiculous to expect that any<br />\none person, even the President,<br />\ncan completely right all the<br />\nwrongs that exist in this country. All the Federal funds in the<br />\nUnited States Budget alone cannot help anyone without people<br />\nto manage, direct, and perform<br />\nthe work that needs to be done.<br />\nIt does not matter whether the<br />\nmoney and materials come<br />\nfrom the \"private sector\" or<br />\nfrom Federal programs; the<br />\nfact is that nothing will be accomplished unless a majority of<br />\nAmericans actually care enough<br />\nto get involved. All the<br />\neditorials, speeches, campaign<br />\npromises, and plans that can be<br />\ncreated, are worthless without<br />\npublic support and involvement. Complacency, contentment with the status quo,<br />\npoisons any impetus for<br />\nchange.

These few institutions<br />\nare among the top institutions<br />\nin the U.S., with each having a<br />\nsizable program of researchers<br />\nand students.<br />\nThere are about 50 other institutions throughout the nation, each with only one or two<br />\npeople doing research in rational mechanics. Just such an<br />\ninstitution is Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwhich has one researcher, Professor Clifford A. Truesdell,<br />\nIII, investigating topics in rational mechanics.<br />\nTruesdell, along with several<br />\nother professors, was part of a<br />\nmuch larger mechanics department, which existed before the<br />\nre-opening of the School of<br />\n<br />\nEngineering in 1979. In the<br />\n1960's there were four or five<br />\nfaculty members, about onethird of the old mechanics<br />\ndepartment, whose research interests were rational mechanics.<br />\nThese researchers were part of<br />\na world-famous department of<br />\nmechanics. From the early Sixties to the late Seventies, these<br />\nprofessors instructed and<br />\ngraduated over 50 post-doctoral<br />\nstudents and one or two doctoral students per year.<br />\nRational mechanics has been<br />\ndescribed as a \"branch of<br />\nmathematics, whose undefined<br />\nobjects are those of geometry,<br />\nenriched by force, mass, acceleration, and energy (along<br />\nwith the thermodynamic concepts for systems involving<br />\nheat). Its theorems concern the<br />\nconfigurations and motions of<br />\nbodies resulting from given<br />\nforces in given conditions.\" Rational mechanics \"is a field<br />\nwhich, although constantly<br />\ngrowing, has never experienced<br />\na revolution in its objects and<br />\nmethods.\"<br />\n<br />\nJames Lightner.

Truesdell was one of<br />\nthe six Americns chosen; he was<br />\ncited for his \"fundamental contributions to fluid mechanics<br />\nand the history of mechanics.\"<br />\nThe ceremony was held in La<br />\nScala Opera House; the<br />\ndiplomas were handed out by<br />\nthe President of Italy. Truesdell<br />\nwas asked to render thanks on<br />\nbehalf of all those honored. So<br />\nas not to discriminate among<br />\nthe seven native languages, he<br />\nspoke in Latin.<br />\nThe artistic interests of<br />\nTruesdell include music from<br />\nthe Baroque and earlier<br />\nperiods, and a strong interest in<br />\nantiques. He also enjoys viewing all types of works of art.<br />\nThis is especially true of paintings which have one large<br />\nscene. Strong interests in this<br />\narea are paintings with scenes<br />\nfrom classical mythology, epic<br />\npoems, and great religious<br />\nevents. He also enjoys viewing<br />\nclassical Greek sculpture and<br />\nnearly all types of medieval art.<br />\nIn fact, Truesdell's interest in<br />\nantiques and furniture has led<br />\nto his first magazine article on<br />\n<br />\nfurniture. This article is soon to<br />\nappear in a major journal on<br />\nfurniture that is published in<br />\nEngland.<br />\nTruesdell has some strong<br />\nopinions about science and<br />\nscientists. He sees a trend<br />\ntoward too great a reliance on<br />\ncomputers. He believes people<br />\nare depending on them as if<br />\nthey were a true source of<br />\nknowledge. Truesdell believes<br />\nthat we must originate all inquiry, and avoid letting the<br />\ncomputer lead any inquiry.<br />\nTruesdell points out that<br />\nmuch of the current scientific<br />\ninquiry, from the physical<br />\nsciences to the various engineering discplines, is based upon<br />\nmathematics that is 100, even<br />\n200 years old. His view is that<br />\nsome of the most fruitful results<br />\ncan be obtained from using<br />\n,mathematics,<br />\npossibly<br />\ndeveloped<br />\nin<br />\nrational<br />\nmechanics, that is less than 100<br />\nyears old.<br />\nTruesdell's opinions on an<br />\nundergraduate education would<br />\nnot fall on deaf ears at<br />\nHopkins. He sees undergraduate education as very<br />\noften being hampered by an excessive amount of requirements<br />\nand rules. One may say that<br />\nthat could prevent the formation of a \"well-rounded\"<br />\nindividual. But what of the student who has a strong talent or<br />\na deep desire to explore some<br />\nfield, and yet must take many<br />\ncourses in areas other than his<br />\ninterest?<br />\nTruesdell also has strong opinions on the actual courses that<br />\nundergraduates must enroll in.<br />\nHe sees the large number of<br />\ngeneral<br />\ncourses<br />\nthat<br />\nundergraduates must take as<br />\nlargely consisting of poor agglomerations of information.<br />\nHe feels that these courses can<br />\ngenerate disinterest and often<br />\nare poor preparation for genuine scientific inquiry.<br />\nPerhaps Truesdell's most<br />\ndistinct comment is that<br />\n\"knowledge is created by individuals, who are usually<br />\nworking alone,\" and that<br />\nthinking man often produces<br />\nhis most unique contributions<br />\nwhen he is not part of, or<br />\nhindered by some large<br />\norganization.<br />\n<br />\nHighlights...<br />\nPublic TV-Science and<br />\nNature Programs<br />\nFri.,Sept. 14, 3:30 p.m.:The<br />\nVoyage of the Mimi: Going<br />\nFishing.

While the legislation was passed<br />\nmore than two years ago, the issue remains<br />\na sticky one for colleges and universities<br />\nthroughout the state. This is due to the fact<br />\nthat, for the first time, the majority of college undergraduates are underage.<br />\nColleges are faced with the responsibility<br />\nto adopt regulations which reflect their interpretation of the drinking age law. Some<br />\ninstitutions have chosen to ban alcohol from<br />\nall campus events. Others have elected to retain drinking policies already in existence.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University administration has maintained that all universityaffiliated functions will uphold the law.<br />\nThis is an admirable stance, but not a simple one. True, the university must obey the<br />\nlaw. Yet, at the same time, it must accomodate those students who may legally drink.<br />\nRather than eliminating alcohol entirely, the<br />\nadministration should solicit student input<br />\nin search of a mutually acceptable policy.<br />\nIt seems there has been definite progress<br />\nin this direction. Meetings have been scheduled with interested students and groups, in-<br /><br />\nLetters<br /><br />\ncluding class officers and the inter-fraternity<br />\ncouncil. Such action is commendable and<br />\nshould be supported strongly.<br />\nSome individuals and organizations,<br />\nhowever, continue to oppose adherence to<br />\nthe law. They feel that the university should<br />\ncondone drinking, or at least merely ignore<br />\nit. Their principal reason is the fact that<br />\nunderage students will drink, regardless of<br />\nregulations. Additionally, they maintain that<br />\nstudents will be forced off campus in search<br />\nof liquor and, if access to a car is available,<br />\nthe initial purpose of the law, the prevention<br />\nof drunken driving, will be subverted.<br />\nThese are substantial claims and must be<br />\nconsidered seriously. It is doubtful that the<br />\nadministration believes that students will not<br />\ndrink merely because a law exists against it.<br />\nAlcohol is traditionally an integral part of<br />\nthe college experience, especially at Hopkins.<br />\nNevertheless, the decision to drink or to drive<br />\nafter drinking is an individual one. We, as<br />\nadults, must accept the responsibility for our<br />\nactions.<br />\nJohns Hopkins, however, has a much<br />\nbroader responsibility. An institution cannot espouse maturity and integrity and, at<br />\nthe same time, assist its constituents in<br />\ndisregarding the law, either blatantly or<br />\nsurreptitiously.<br /><br />\nand probably at an increased<br />\npower.<br />\nThat was the last that we<br />\nheard on the subject until last<br />\nweek's Newsletter came out.<br />\nThere, on the front page, was<br />\nthe news I had waited so long<br />\nfor\u2014\"WJHU to Return After<br />\nYear Off Air.\"<br />\nBut elation quickly turned to<br />\nyet another disappointment<br />\nwhen I read that WJHU won't<br />\nbe student-run anymore. Why?<br />\nDoes the university feel that its<br />\nstudents can't handle the<br />\nresponsibiltiy anymore?<br />\nI think it's time for another<br />\nWJHU staff meeting. It's time<br />\nfor the administration to provide some answers to those of<br />\nus who cared about the radio<br />\nstation. For starters, why do<br />\nthey feel a professional station<br />\nmanager is needed? Why<br />\nwasn't WJHU reopened on<br />\nschedule two monthe ago\u2014was<br />\nthere a serious, unforeseen problem, or just procrastination?<br />\nAnd most importantly, will we,<br />\nthe students, have any say indetermining the programming?<br />\nCan we once again be DJs and<br />\nengineers and newscasters and<br />\nsportscasters, or will our only<br />\nway of \"getting involved\" in<br />\nWJHU be to file records in the<br />\nrecord library as the professionals take over the airwaves?<br />\nI would like to ask the administration to call the staff of<br />\nWJHU together once more,<br />\nprovide us with some answers<br />\nand explanations, and then<br />\nopen it up for questions. Yes,<br />\nsome resentment may come<br />\npouring out, but that's<br />\nunderstandable, given the<br />\ncircumstances.<br />\nWJHU was an important<br />\npart of my life last year and I<br />\nthoroughly enjoyed my experience on the staff. Before<br />\nWJHU comes back, I, and undoubtedly many other, want to<br />\nbe reassured that we'll still have<br />\na place there, and that we'll<br />\nhave a say in the station's<br />\nfuture.<br /><br />\nwhich the WJHU situation has<br />\nbeen handled can only be called disgusting. The student and<br />\ncommunity members of the station have been used by the administration, only to be left out<br />\nof the final decision-making<br />\nprocess. The last straw was the<br />\nactive students finding out<br />\nabout the station's fate in the<br />\nNews-Letter. The least that Dr.<br />\nMuller could have done was to<br />\ncall a staff meeting at which the<br />\nnew plans could be presented.<br />\nInstead, we were ignored for<br />\nfive months from the time that<br />\nstation left the air on April 1<br />\nuntil the N-L article last week.<br />\nOver the years, WJHU has<br />\ndeveloped a reputation as one<br />\nof the finest student operated<br />\nradio stations in the country.<br />\nBaltimore Magazine even<br />\nrecognized it as 'Baltimore's<br />\nBest Radio Station' several<br />\nyears ago. With few exceptions,<br />\nthe staff exhibited extraordinary professionalism on the<br />\nair, a service which the community appreciated. Even when<br />\nwe wondered whether or not<br />\nanyone was really listening, we<br />\nstayed on the air through<br />\nmiserable weather, exam<br />\nperiods, vacations and<br />\nholidays. When we did go off<br />\nthe air, we were deluged with<br />\nmail and calls from all of the<br />\npeople who missed us. When<br />\nwere there, they took us for<br />\ngranted. Now that we're gone,<br />\nwe're sorely missed. The<br />\nFederal Communications Commission found our record to be<br />\ngood enough to warrant an increase in our broadcast power<br />\nby 2500 times.<br />\nThe approval for the boost to<br />\n25 kilowatts was granted in<br />\nAugust of 1983. From the moment that the permit was received, the station management was<br />\nput to work gathering information and making plans for the<br />\nnew facilities which would be<br />\nneeded. Even as this was happening however, the staff<br />\nmembers, aware of what was<br />\ngoing on, were sworn to secrecy<br />\nabout the permit, even though<br />\nit is legally a matter of public<br />\nrecord. The Managing Board<br />\ncontinued for seven months to<br />\nmeet with the administration,<br />\npresenting their plans and<br />\nanswering questions.

Weiser's<br />\ntitle, Injustice at Rosebud,<br />\nbecomes a polite understatement in contrast to the gross<br />\nlack of human compassion that<br />\nexists. His article points out the<br />\nconsignment of a whole ethnic<br />\ngroup, a Sioux tribe, to<br />\nsubhuman status. In the first<br />\ntwo installments of the series,<br />\nthe readership of the Post<br />\nlearned that \"seven of every 10<br />\njobless,\"<br />\nSioux<br />\nare<br />\n\"some....live in shacks and old<br />\ncars,\" that its physicians are<br />\nlargely \"...unfit, unqualified,<br />\nunsuitable, and in some cases,<br />\nunlicensed...,\" that violence,<br />\npoverty, disease, and squalor<br />\nare \"intense.\" Further description of the situation at Rosebud<br />\nin this article would be needless<br />\nduplication; Weiser's series<br />\nshould be read closely by any<br />\ninterested readers. What is very<br />\nimportant about these articles is<br />\nthe broader problem that<br />\nbecomes apparent: the fact that<br />\nRosebud, while it is \"....not<br />\ntypical of America's 265 Indian<br />\nreservations...,\" stands as<br /><br />\n....a chilling example of what<br />\ncan happen in this country<br />\nwhen the most basic civil liberties and essential institutions do<br />\nnot exist or are allowed to<br />\ndeteriorate.\"<br />\nWhat happens when we<br />\nunderstand that groups of U.S.<br />\ncitizens like the Sioux are<br />\ndenied the fundamental rights<br />\nof which Americans are so<br />\nproud? A basic, almost naive<br />\nassumption can be made: the<br />\nAmerican political system does<br />\nnot work for all its citizens. For<br />\nsome, the patriotic, flag-waving<br />\nmentality that pervades an election year becomes somewhat<br />\nmore than hollow. However,<br />\nmany of the people who<br />\nbecome concerned about<br />\ndiscrimination and civil rights<br />\nviolations, those very people<br />\nwho have the capability to actually do something to help oppressed and disadvantaged people, invariably lapse into<br />\ncynicism. It seems to be the<br />\npopular attitude to have; it is<br />\npopular to be a \"lost generation\" person. The pervading attitude is to ignore politics, to<br />\nsay that all politicians are<br />\nworthless sycophants of one<br />\nspecial interest group or<br />\nanother. Although it is true that<br />\nmany voters must choose \"the<br />\nlesser evil\" when participating<br />\nin an election, is it impossible<br />\nto choose a candidate who at<br />\nleast appears to favor aid and<br /><br />\njustice for groups like the Indians of Rosebud? Is it unlikely that a person who truly<br />\nbelieves in \"justice for all\"<br />\ncould be found, no matter how<br />\nlong it takes? A vote in<br />\nNovember's general election is<br />\nthe very least that any concerned voter should give, if he or<br />\nshe really hopes to change the<br />\ninequities of society.<br />\nIs there more that anyone<br />\ncan do to change the conditions<br />\nof life for the disadvantaged? It<br />\nis ridiculous to expect that any<br />\none person, even the President,<br />\ncan completely right all the<br />\nwrongs that exist in this country. All the Federal funds in the<br />\nUnited States Budget alone cannot help anyone without people<br />\nto manage, direct, and perform<br />\nthe work that needs to be done.<br />\nIt does not matter whether the<br />\nmoney and materials come<br />\nfrom the \"private sector\" or<br />\nfrom Federal programs; the<br />\nfact is that nothing will be accomplished unless a majority of<br />\nAmericans actually care enough<br />\nto get involved. All the<br />\neditorials, speeches, campaign<br />\npromises, and plans that can be<br />\ncreated, are worthless without<br />\npublic support and involvement.

These few institutions<br />\nare among the top institutions<br />\nin the U.S., with each having a<br />\nsizable program of researchers<br />\nand students.<br />\nThere are about 50 other institutions throughout the nation, each with only one or two<br />\npeople doing research in rational mechanics. Just such an<br />\ninstitution is Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwhich has one researcher, Professor Clifford A. Truesdell,<br />\nIII, investigating topics in rational mechanics.<br />\nTruesdell, along with several<br />\nother professors, was part of a<br />\nmuch larger mechanics department, which existed before the<br />\nre-opening of the School of<br /><br />\nEngineering in 1979. In the<br />\n1960's there were four or five<br />\nfaculty members, about onethird of the old mechanics<br />\ndepartment, whose research interests were rational mechanics.<br />\nThese researchers were part of<br />\na world-famous department of<br />\nmechanics. From the early Sixties to the late Seventies, these<br />\nprofessors instructed and<br />\ngraduated over 50 post-doctoral<br />\nstudents and one or two doctoral students per year.<br />\nRational mechanics has been<br />\ndescribed as a \"branch of<br />\nmathematics, whose undefined<br />\nobjects are those of geometry,<br />\nenriched by force, mass, acceleration, and energy (along<br />\nwith the thermodynamic concepts for systems involving<br />\nheat). Its theorems concern the<br />\nconfigurations and motions of<br />\nbodies resulting from given<br />\nforces in given conditions.\" Rational mechanics \"is a field<br />\nwhich, although constantly<br />\ngrowing, has never experienced<br />\na revolution in its objects and<br />\nmethods.\"<br /><br />\nJames Lightner.

Truesdell was one of<br />\nthe six Americns chosen; he was<br />\ncited for his \"fundamental contributions to fluid mechanics<br />\nand the history of mechanics.\"<br />\nThe ceremony was held in La<br />\nScala Opera House; the<br />\ndiplomas were handed out by<br />\nthe President of Italy. Truesdell<br />\nwas asked to render thanks on<br />\nbehalf of all those honored. So<br />\nas not to discriminate among<br />\nthe seven native languages, he<br />\nspoke in Latin.<br />\nThe artistic interests of<br />\nTruesdell include music from<br />\nthe Baroque and earlier<br />\nperiods, and a strong interest in<br />\nantiques. He also enjoys viewing all types of works of art.<br />\nThis is especially true of paintings which have one large<br />\nscene. Strong interests in this<br />\narea are paintings with scenes<br />\nfrom classical mythology, epic<br />\npoems, and great religious<br />\nevents. He also enjoys viewing<br />\nclassical Greek sculpture and<br />\nnearly all types of medieval art.<br />\nIn fact, Truesdell's interest in<br />\nantiques and furniture has led<br />\nto his first magazine article on<br /><br />\nfurniture. This article is soon to<br />\nappear in a major journal on<br />\nfurniture that is published in<br />\nEngland.<br />\nTruesdell has some strong<br />\nopinions about science and<br />\nscientists. He sees a trend<br />\ntoward too great a reliance on<br />\ncomputers. He believes people<br />\nare depending on them as if<br />\nthey were a true source of<br />\nknowledge. Truesdell believes<br />\nthat we must originate all inquiry, and avoid letting the<br />\ncomputer lead any inquiry.<br />\nTruesdell points out that<br />\nmuch of the current scientific<br />\ninquiry, from the physical<br />\nsciences to the various engineering discplines, is based upon<br />\nmathematics that is 100, even<br />\n200 years old. His view is that<br />\nsome of the most fruitful results<br />\ncan be obtained from using<br />\n,mathematics,<br />\npossibly<br />\ndeveloped<br />\nin<br />\nrational<br />\nmechanics, that is less than 100<br />\nyears old.<br />\nTruesdell's opinions on an<br />\nundergraduate education would<br />\nnot fall on deaf ears at<br />\nHopkins. He sees undergraduate education as very<br />\noften being hampered by an excessive amount of requirements<br />\nand rules. One may say that<br />\nthat could prevent the formation of a \"well-rounded\"<br />\nindividual. But what of the student who has a strong talent or<br />\na deep desire to explore some<br />\nfield, and yet must take many<br />\ncourses in areas other than his<br />\ninterest?<br />\nTruesdell also has strong opinions on the actual courses that<br />\nundergraduates must enroll in.<br />\nHe sees the large number of<br />\ngeneral<br />\ncourses<br />\nthat<br />\nundergraduates must take as<br />\nlargely consisting of poor agglomerations of information.<br />\nHe feels that these courses can<br />\ngenerate disinterest and often<br />\nare poor preparation for genuine scientific inquiry.<br />\nPerhaps Truesdell's most<br />\ndistinct comment is that<br />\n\"knowledge is created by individuals, who are usually<br />\nworking alone,\" and that<br />\nthinking man often produces<br />\nhis most unique contributions<br />\nwhen he is not part of, or<br />\nhindered by some large<br />\norganization.<br /><br />\nHighlights...<br />\nPublic TV-Science and<br />\nNature Programs<br />\nFri.,Sept. 14, 3:30 p.m.:The<br />\nVoyage of the Mimi: Going<br />\nFishing.
