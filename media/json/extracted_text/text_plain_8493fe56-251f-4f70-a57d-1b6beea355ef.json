The apparatus, according to Dr. Wood, is of great<br />\nPower, being of a two-kilowatt<br />\ntype. During the latter part of<br />\nthe war experiments on sound<br />\nwaves were made in order to devise a means of detecting underwater craft.

Y.,<br />\ndiscovered that sound waves are<br />\nvery effective on small water aniMals.

When<br />\nthe sound vibrations were directed<br />\nto this tube, the tube immediately<br />\nbroke in a way which could be imitated by no known tool, said Dr.<br />\nWood.<br />\nThe effects of sound radiation<br />\nwas also shown in several ways.<br />\nThe result was a series of concentric circles which were photographed on a champagne glass and<br />\na glass disc.<br />\nWhen experimenting on the biological effects of sound, Dr. Wood<br />\nsaid that small animals met an instantaneous death.
