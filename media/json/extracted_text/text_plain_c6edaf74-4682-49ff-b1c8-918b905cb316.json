Then, asked to select the work area of his<br />\nchoice, he picked the Semi-Conductor Device Development Group in Research. \"My first assignment,\" he<br />\nsays, \"was to plot various electrical and physical device parameters for a large number of transistors in<br />\nthe form of graphs or histograms in order to obtain<br />\ncorrelation coefficients of the device characteristics.\"<br />\n<br />\nMany fascinating assignments<br />\nOther projects followed<br />\nin rapid succession:<br />\nWork on a germanium<br />\ndrift, diffused base<br />\ntransistor (he was the<br />\nsecond of his group to<br />\nenter this field) . .<br />\nwork on silicon as a<br />\ntransistor material doing evaporations of impurities on the silicon<br />\n(he is known as the<br />\n\"pioneer silicon device<br />\nA problem in saturation resistance<br />\nman\" of his group).<br />\n\"Silicon is better than germanium because of better<br />\ntemperature and voltage breakdown points,\" he mentions. \"But it is difficult to find a material to wet<br />\nsilicon to form alloyed junctions.

But how many of us go about<br />\nseeking mates,as I like to call them,in a truly scientific manner?<br />\nNot many, you may be sure.<br />\nSo let us today make a scientific survey of the. two principal<br />\ncauses of marriage\u2014personality need and propinquity.<br />\nPersonality need means that we choose mates because they<br />\npossess certain qualities that complete and fulfill our own personalities. Take, for example, the case of Alanson Duck.<br />\nAs a freshman Alanson made a fine scholastic record, played<br />\nvarsity scrabble, and was president of his class. One would<br />\nthink that Manson was a totally fulfilled man. But he was not.<br />\nThere was something lacking in his life, something vague and<br />\nindefinable that was needed to make his personality complete.<br />\nThen one day Alanson discovered what it was. As he was<br />\nwalking out of his class in Flemish pottery, a fetching coed<br />\nnamed Grace Ek offered him a handsome red and white pack<br />\nand said, \"Marlboro?\"<br />\n\"Yes!\" he cried, for all at once he knew what he had been<br />\nneeding to round out his personality\u2014the hearty fulfillment of<br />\nMarlboro Cigarettes, the soul-repairing mildness of their fine<br />\ntobaceo, the easy draw of their unparalleled filter, the ease and<br />\nconvenience of their crushproof flip-top box. \"Yes, I will take a<br />\nMarlboro!\" cried Alanson. \"And I will also take you to wife<br />\nif you will have me!\"<br />\n\"La!\" she exclaimed, throwing her apron over her face. But<br />\nafter a while she removed it and they were married..Today<br />\nthey live happily in Baffin Land where Alanson is with an<br />\notter-glazing firm and Grace is a bookie.<br />\nPropinquity, the.second principal cause of marriage, simply<br />\nmeans closeness. Put a boy and a girl close together for a sustained period of time and their proximity will certainly ripen<br />\ninto love and their love into marriage. A perfect example is<br />\nthe case of Fafnir Sigafoos.<br />\nWhile a freshman at Louisiana State University, Fafnir was<br />\nrequired to crawl through the .Big Inch pipeline as part of his<br />\nfraternity initiation. He entered the pipe at Baton Rouge and,<br />\nalone and joyless, he proceeded to crawl 'north.<br />\nAs he passed Lafayette, Indiana, be was agreeably surprised<br />\nto be joined by a comely girl named Mary Alice Isinglass, a<br />\nPurdue freshman, who, oddly enough\u201e had to crawl through<br />\nthe Big Inch as part of her sorority initiation.<br />\n<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nI was pleased to read that<br />\nyour reporter enjoyed himself at<br />\nthe Playshop performance of<br />\n\"The Doctor in Spite of Himself.\" He seemed to revel especially in the double entendres,<br />\nand<br />\n\"ungentlemanly<br />\nbarbs,\"<br />\n\"Freudian overtones,\" of which<br />\nhis puritan ancestors taught him<br />\nto be acutely aware. It is clear<br />\nto the average theater-goer that<br />\nyour critic is a carefully tutored<br />\nand inately skillful student of<br />\nthe dramatic arts. His comparing Moliere to a pulp novelist<br />\nshows amazing critical insight<br />\nand should be sent on to PMLA<br />\nposthaste. With breathtaking<br />\nbrevity and incisive depth of<br />\nvision he, in one sentence, notes<br />\nthat the production had \" a<br />\nsuperb cast, lavish costumes, and<br />\n<br />\ntruly (truly one of his favorite<br />\nwords and only employed when<br />\nthe possibility of self-deceit is<br />\npresent) fine direction.\" Well so<br />\nmuch for the eview, thought<br />\nhe. However, the editor must<br />\nhave informed him of four<br />\nvacant columns anxiously awaiting his deathless prose, for he<br />\nboldly set forth to pad his story.<br />\nI think he did very well considering all he had to say has been<br />\nquoted above. Thus the transformation from a one sentence<br />\nreview to a four column polemic<br />\nis effected and nobody is the<br />\ndumber. In such an expansion<br />\nnothing is sacred, not even the<br />\ntruth. All things are fair game,<br />\nand it is a wonder that everything and everybody, from the<br />\nForth Bridge in Scotland to<br />\nMary Baker Eddy is not felled<br />\n<br />\nby the mighty prosaic sword of<br />\nour News-Letter drama critic.<br />\nWm.

So, when I<br />\ngraduated from the University of Maine in June, 1955,<br />\nI naturally turned to the computer field. IBM, recognized as a leader in this expanding electronics area,<br />\nlooked like a good place for me.\"<br />\nBob Pike began his IBM career as a Technical Engineer, starting with a training program that lasted several months. Then, asked to select the work area of his<br />\nchoice, he picked the Semi-Conductor Device Development Group in Research. \"My first assignment,\" he<br />\nsays, \"was to plot various electrical and physical device parameters for a large number of transistors in<br />\nthe form of graphs or histograms in order to obtain<br />\ncorrelation coefficients of the device characteristics.\"<br /><br />\nMany fascinating assignments<br />\nOther projects followed<br />\nin rapid succession:<br />\nWork on a germanium<br />\ndrift, diffused base<br />\ntransistor (he was the<br />\nsecond of his group to<br />\nenter this field) . .<br />\nwork on silicon as a<br />\ntransistor material doing evaporations of impurities on the silicon<br />\n(he is known as the<br />\n\"pioneer silicon device<br />\nA problem in saturation resistance<br />\nman\" of his group).<br />\n\"Silicon is better than germanium because of better<br />\ntemperature and voltage breakdown points,\" he mentions. \"But it is difficult to find a material to wet<br />\nsilicon to form alloyed junctions. I recall making the<br />\nsmall contacts with an ultrasonic soldering iron.\"<br />\nBob Pike was promoted to Associate Physicist in<br />\nDecember, 1956. His present assignment is leading a<br />\ngroup of technicians in fabricating high-frequency,<br />\nhigh-power PNP drift transistors. \"We use a process<br />\nI developed,\" he says. \"These transistors will be used<br />\nas core drivers in a high-speed memory array.\"<br />\nAsk him about this \"most interesting\" project and<br />\nhe'll tell you,\"Working with the evaporation of alloying impurities and designing 'new' semi-conductor<br />\ndevices.\"<br /><br />\nSold on IBM<br />\nBob Pike is enthusiastic about IBM as a place to work.<br />\n\"The glowing descriptions of my work,\" he remi-<br /><br />\nnisces,\"the extensive research facilities and the friendly<br />\nemployee-management<br />\nrelations brought two<br />\nE.E. friends of mine to<br />\nIBM from Maine, my<br />\nAlma Mater.\"<br />\nHis future?

And this, we think, is exactly where<br />\nthe failure lies.<br />\nHere the DSRC can implement Dean Shaffer's<br />\nplans for the dormitory. By providing the leadership<br />\nnecessary to allow for letting off steam by the denizens<br />\nof the dormitories, it can make the dorms in fact a home<br />\naway from home.<br />\nThe bleakness of the rooms in the houses can be alleviated, with much lessening of expense to the City of<br />\nBaltimore Department of Signs, by opening a store perhaps in the basement to sell rugs, curtains, brooms and<br />\nfurnishings for same\u2014cheaply. Or at least sponsoring<br />\na Student Shop effort in the same direction.<br />\nWe commend the organization for its efforts to initiate and continue the interhouse athletic program, the<br />\ndances, and a few student rallies. But many of the projects<br />\nbog down, not through the lack of support of the students, but of the representatives themselves. It is noteworthy that in houses with representatives who are interested in their jobs, these projects and many private<br />\nones have received excellent support.<br />\nWe suspect that a good deal of the famous Hopkins<br />\napathy is at least equally shared by the individual representatives.<br />\nJ.B.<br /><br />\nthe fact that 'File 7' is the second oldest program of any kind<br />\non T.V.; only the Kraft Theatre<br />\nis older. From those early, unstable years as a \"vigorous<br />\nyoungster\" in Lig-time T.V.,'File<br />\n7' has grown to a highly respected, valuable program in the medium of television. It enjoys an<br />\ninternational reputation and it<br />\nhas collected a .string of awards<br />\nand citations unequalled by any<br />\nshow in its class.<br />\nStarted in 1946<br />\nThe use of television as a<br />\nmeans of passing on fascinating<br />\nand<br />\nworthwhile<br />\ninformation<br />\nfrom a university to the public<br />\nwas germinating in the mind of<br />\nLynn Poole in 1946 when he took<br />\nover a.s the first director of public relations at Hopkin.s. At that<br />\ntime, Baltimore did not have a<br />\ntelevision outlet, but in 1948,<br />\nwhen one was established, Poole<br />\nwas ready.<br />\nCommencing as \"The Johns<br />\nHopkins Science Review,\" this<br />\nvastly different program began<br />\nto attract the eyes and ears of<br />\nthe intelligent viewer. Recognition, too, came rapidly. Jack<br />\nGould wrote in the New York<br />\nTimes<br />\nthat, \"A<br />\nthoroughly<br />\nworthwhile and encouraging example of educational television,<br />\nabout which so much has been<br />\nheard and so little done, can now<br />\nbe seen at 8:30 Tuesday nights.<br />\nIt is called Science Review. In<br />\nthirty minutes it bridges, with a<br />\ngreat deal of effectiveness, the<br />\ngap that separates the layman<br />\nfrom the researchers and scientists in the laboratory.\"<br />\nHonored By Peabody Citation<br />\nBy 1950 it was undeniable that<br />\nthis program from Johns Hop-<br /><br />\nappearing will be Dr. Donald Andrews, Dr. Theodore Berlin, Dr.<br />\nDayton Carritt, Dr. Francis<br />\nClauser, Dr. William D. McElroy.<br />\nDr. Charles Singleton and Dr.<br />\nThomas Turner.<br />\nIn his introduction to the anniversary program, Dr. Eisenhower states, \"Our purpose in<br />\npresenting this continuing series<br />\nhas been in harmony with the<br />\nobligations of a university, which<br />\none leading educator defined as<br />\n'untiringly to seek the truth ...<br />\nto hold fast to truth once gained,<br />\nand to interpret it.\" Thus we<br /><br />\ngained a healthier understanding of the meaning of science:<br />\nbut what of the Future?<br />\n\"This question is answered as<br />\neasily as the last. When a local<br />\nstation such as WJZ-TV and a<br />\ntelevision network such as the<br />\nAmerican Broadcasting Company have faith in such a program, the way is open for continuing to make this worthwhile<br />\nservice available to the public.<br />\nCertainly a university such as<br />\nJohns Hopkins can do no less<br />\nthan to pledge its fullest efforts<br />\nto this end.\"<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 14, 1958<br /><br />\nonears<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nwith<br />\nMax ghulman<br /><br />\n(By the Author of\"Rally Round the Flag,Boys!\"and,<br />\n\"Barefoot Boy with Cheek.\")<br /><br />\nFOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE<br />\nThe first, thought that comes into our minds upon entering<br />\ncollege is, of course, marriage. But how many of us go about<br />\nseeking mates,as I like to call them,in a truly scientific manner?<br />\nNot many, you may be sure.<br />\nSo let us today make a scientific survey of the. two principal<br />\ncauses of marriage\u2014personality need and propinquity.<br />\nPersonality need means that we choose mates because they<br />\npossess certain qualities that complete and fulfill our own personalities. Take, for example, the case of Alanson Duck.<br />\nAs a freshman Alanson made a fine scholastic record, played<br />\nvarsity scrabble, and was president of his class. One would<br />\nthink that Manson was a totally fulfilled man. But he was not.<br />\nThere was something lacking in his life, something vague and<br />\nindefinable that was needed to make his personality complete.<br />\nThen one day Alanson discovered what it was. As he was<br />\nwalking out of his class in Flemish pottery, a fetching coed<br />\nnamed Grace Ek offered him a handsome red and white pack<br />\nand said, \"Marlboro?\"<br />\n\"Yes!\" he cried, for all at once he knew what he had been<br />\nneeding to round out his personality\u2014the hearty fulfillment of<br />\nMarlboro Cigarettes, the soul-repairing mildness of their fine<br />\ntobaceo, the easy draw of their unparalleled filter, the ease and<br />\nconvenience of their crushproof flip-top box. \"Yes, I will take a<br />\nMarlboro!\" cried Alanson. \"And I will also take you to wife<br />\nif you will have me!\"<br />\n\"La!\" she exclaimed, throwing her apron over her face. But<br />\nafter a while she removed it and they were married..Today<br />\nthey live happily in Baffin Land where Alanson is with an<br />\notter-glazing firm and Grace is a bookie.<br />\nPropinquity, the.second principal cause of marriage, simply<br />\nmeans closeness. Put a boy and a girl close together for a sustained period of time and their proximity will certainly ripen<br />\ninto love and their love into marriage. A perfect example is<br />\nthe case of Fafnir Sigafoos.<br />\nWhile a freshman at Louisiana State University, Fafnir was<br />\nrequired to crawl through the .Big Inch pipeline as part of his<br />\nfraternity initiation. He entered the pipe at Baton Rouge and,<br />\nalone and joyless, he proceeded to crawl 'north.<br />\nAs he passed Lafayette, Indiana, be was agreeably surprised<br />\nto be joined by a comely girl named Mary Alice Isinglass, a<br />\nPurdue freshman, who, oddly enough\u201e had to crawl through<br />\nthe Big Inch as part of her sorority initiation.<br /><br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nI was pleased to read that<br />\nyour reporter enjoyed himself at<br />\nthe Playshop performance of<br />\n\"The Doctor in Spite of Himself.\" He seemed to revel especially in the double entendres,<br />\nand<br />\n\"ungentlemanly<br />\nbarbs,\"<br />\n\"Freudian overtones,\" of which<br />\nhis puritan ancestors taught him<br />\nto be acutely aware. It is clear<br />\nto the average theater-goer that<br />\nyour critic is a carefully tutored<br />\nand inately skillful student of<br />\nthe dramatic arts. His comparing Moliere to a pulp novelist<br />\nshows amazing critical insight<br />\nand should be sent on to PMLA<br />\nposthaste. With breathtaking<br />\nbrevity and incisive depth of<br />\nvision he, in one sentence, notes<br />\nthat the production had \" a<br />\nsuperb cast, lavish costumes, and<br /><br />\ntruly (truly one of his favorite<br />\nwords and only employed when<br />\nthe possibility of self-deceit is<br />\npresent) fine direction.\" Well so<br />\nmuch for the eview, thought<br />\nhe. However, the editor must<br />\nhave informed him of four<br />\nvacant columns anxiously awaiting his deathless prose, for he<br />\nboldly set forth to pad his story.<br />\nI think he did very well considering all he had to say has been<br />\nquoted above. Thus the transformation from a one sentence<br />\nreview to a four column polemic<br />\nis effected and nobody is the<br />\ndumber. In such an expansion<br />\nnothing is sacred, not even the<br />\ntruth. All things are fair game,<br />\nand it is a wonder that everything and everybody, from the<br />\nForth Bridge in Scotland to<br />\nMary Baker Eddy is not felled<br /><br />\nby the mighty prosaic sword of<br />\nour News-Letter drama critic.<br />\nWm.
