With a drop of 500<br />\nin enrolment already indicated for the year 1933-34<br />\nthere's not a whole lot of hope for the President's<br />\npeace of mind.<br />\nScarce indeed is the fiscal statement which does<br />\nnot show tremendous shrinkages today. Being \"off\"<br />\nonly one per cent of the approximate total assets of<br />\nthe University constitutes, in fact, much less of a<br />\ngrievance than the average financial embarrassment<br />\nto be found almost anywhere. But with the amount<br />\nof energy and thoughtfulness, labor and manipulation<br />\nwhich President Ames has expended in an effort to<br />\nkeep our heads above water, we are wondering just<br />\nwhat would have been the degree of loss if things<br />\nhad been let alone.<br />\nBut the shortage has another aspect which is<br />\ndecidedly more than of casual interest to \"cash customers\" of the Hopkins. If the money cannot be<br />\ngotten anywhere else; if the investment of endowment funds yields no more than it has, it is J. Finking<br />\nPuntworthy, III, undergraduate, who will have to<br />\npay the price. The authorities have so little respect<br />\nfor,tuition fees right now that they are constantly telling us that what we pay does not by any means cover<br />\nthe actual cost of educating us. Deduce for yourself,<br />\nthen, the logical one to be further assessed, assuming<br />\nthat you see things from the administration's point<br />\nof view.<br />\nOur present fees are certainly not exorbitant,<br />\nconsidering the nature of the opportunities offered.<br />\nHard to pay, yes. But so are all bills. It may be<br />\neven conceded that we have a right to pay more, but<br />\nthat question is moot. However, there is one consideration which we would like to place before President Ames in this connection, namely, why not shift<br />\na little of the burden onto the shoulders of the<br />\ngraduate students?<br />\nCertainly if any part of the Homewood establishment receives more attention and pampering than<br />\nanother, it is the graduate department. It has occupied a favored place in the affections of Hopkins<br />\npresidents for years past, and its interests have continually been allowed precedence over those of the<br />\nCollege and Economics and Engineering Schools. If<br />\nthis attitude is justified by the greater value to the<br />\nUniversity of the graduates and if graduates consider<br />\nit a provilege to study at the Hopkins because of the<br />\nbetter facilities provided, then ti is only logical that<br />\ntheir tuition should be made proportionate.<br />\nUnder the present arrangement considerably<br />\nmore than half of the enrollment is in the graduate<br />\n<br />\ndepartments, yet the tuition for graduates is $50 less<br />\nless than for undergraduates. We don't want the<br />\nadministration to soak those who boast higher intellectual attainment than we, but we would like to see<br />\na little more equality in the financial burden placed<br />\nupon them. Either that, or accord us a greater share<br />\nof the benefits arising from the spending of Univer- Physical Examination Shows Reason for His Strange Power<br />\nsity funds.<br />\n<br />\nCampus Big Shot Makes Slip<br />\nReveals Secret Of Success<br />\n<br />\nWho's A Liberal?<br />\nIn past years a great deal of the good which<br />\nthe Liberal Club has accomplished in its field has<br />\nbeen discounted in the eyes of the undergraduates on<br />\naccount of the prominent part which several radical<br />\ngraduate students have played in the carrying out of<br />\nthe program. No matter how unwelcome the fact<br />\nmay be to the Liberal Club membership, it must be<br />\nrealized that before the conservative and hesitant undergrad can be made radical, if that, indeed, be the<br />\nobject of the Club, he must first be gently persuaded<br />\nto develop first an intellectual curiosity, next, a cautious liberalism, and lastly, a zealous radicalism.<br />\nIt has impressed us as poor strategy to have allowed the Club to fall prey to the rosy-hued zealots<br />\nwho have heretofore been the sole evidence to the<br />\ncampus that a Liberal Club existed. It is such poor<br />\npsychology, don't y'know. To the terrified, and, often,<br />\ndisdainful undergraduate mind the best possible illustration of a Liberalite was a wild-eyed, long-haired,<br />\nblack-hatted individual who was ready to point his<br />\nfinger at you any moment and intone in sinister manner something of this sort: \"The blood of the murdered millions of Russia calls to you for revenge!\"<br />\nLittle wonder that the Club didn't cut such a fancy<br />\nfigure in campus respect.<br />\nThis fact has apparently been grasped by Richard<br />\nFeise, new Dresident of the group. When he addressed the first meeting of the year last Friday he<br />\nurged a more active part upon the undergraduates<br />\npresent, who constituted practically the entire attendance. If the membership as well can be brought<br />\nto a realization of this and if the same calibre of<br />\nspeaker as has come in the past continues, the prospect for achieving a worthwhile influence is considerably enhanced. A university such as the Johns Hopkins cannot afford to be without such an influence<br />\namong the students, and we look forward to an intelligent fulfillment by the Club of our expectations.<br />\n<br />\nIntercollegiate News<br />\nA certain freshman football star at the University of Oklahoma worried about breaking his threeyear record for regular Sunday school attendance<br />\nwhen he was confined to his room following a tonsil<br />\noperation.

With a drop of 500<br />\nin enrolment already indicated for the year 1933-34<br />\nthere's not a whole lot of hope for the President's<br />\npeace of mind.<br />\nScarce indeed is the fiscal statement which does<br />\nnot show tremendous shrinkages today. Being \"off\"<br />\nonly one per cent of the approximate total assets of<br />\nthe University constitutes, in fact, much less of a<br />\ngrievance than the average financial embarrassment<br />\nto be found almost anywhere. But with the amount<br />\nof energy and thoughtfulness, labor and manipulation<br />\nwhich President Ames has expended in an effort to<br />\nkeep our heads above water, we are wondering just<br />\nwhat would have been the degree of loss if things<br />\nhad been let alone.<br />\nBut the shortage has another aspect which is<br />\ndecidedly more than of casual interest to \"cash customers\" of the Hopkins. If the money cannot be<br />\ngotten anywhere else; if the investment of endowment funds yields no more than it has, it is J. Finking<br />\nPuntworthy, III, undergraduate, who will have to<br />\npay the price. The authorities have so little respect<br />\nfor,tuition fees right now that they are constantly telling us that what we pay does not by any means cover<br />\nthe actual cost of educating us. Deduce for yourself,<br />\nthen, the logical one to be further assessed, assuming<br />\nthat you see things from the administration's point<br />\nof view.<br />\nOur present fees are certainly not exorbitant,<br />\nconsidering the nature of the opportunities offered.<br />\nHard to pay, yes. But so are all bills. It may be<br />\neven conceded that we have a right to pay more, but<br />\nthat question is moot. However, there is one consideration which we would like to place before President Ames in this connection, namely, why not shift<br />\na little of the burden onto the shoulders of the<br />\ngraduate students?<br />\nCertainly if any part of the Homewood establishment receives more attention and pampering than<br />\nanother, it is the graduate department. It has occupied a favored place in the affections of Hopkins<br />\npresidents for years past, and its interests have continually been allowed precedence over those of the<br />\nCollege and Economics and Engineering Schools. If<br />\nthis attitude is justified by the greater value to the<br />\nUniversity of the graduates and if graduates consider<br />\nit a provilege to study at the Hopkins because of the<br />\nbetter facilities provided, then ti is only logical that<br />\ntheir tuition should be made proportionate.<br />\nUnder the present arrangement considerably<br />\nmore than half of the enrollment is in the graduate<br /><br />\ndepartments, yet the tuition for graduates is $50 less<br />\nless than for undergraduates. We don't want the<br />\nadministration to soak those who boast higher intellectual attainment than we, but we would like to see<br />\na little more equality in the financial burden placed<br />\nupon them. Either that, or accord us a greater share<br />\nof the benefits arising from the spending of Univer- Physical Examination Shows Reason for His Strange Power<br />\nsity funds.<br /><br />\nCampus Big Shot Makes Slip<br />\nReveals Secret Of Success<br /><br />\nWho's A Liberal?<br />\nIn past years a great deal of the good which<br />\nthe Liberal Club has accomplished in its field has<br />\nbeen discounted in the eyes of the undergraduates on<br />\naccount of the prominent part which several radical<br />\ngraduate students have played in the carrying out of<br />\nthe program. No matter how unwelcome the fact<br />\nmay be to the Liberal Club membership, it must be<br />\nrealized that before the conservative and hesitant undergrad can be made radical, if that, indeed, be the<br />\nobject of the Club, he must first be gently persuaded<br />\nto develop first an intellectual curiosity, next, a cautious liberalism, and lastly, a zealous radicalism.<br />\nIt has impressed us as poor strategy to have allowed the Club to fall prey to the rosy-hued zealots<br />\nwho have heretofore been the sole evidence to the<br />\ncampus that a Liberal Club existed. It is such poor<br />\npsychology, don't y'know. To the terrified, and, often,<br />\ndisdainful undergraduate mind the best possible illustration of a Liberalite was a wild-eyed, long-haired,<br />\nblack-hatted individual who was ready to point his<br />\nfinger at you any moment and intone in sinister manner something of this sort: \"The blood of the murdered millions of Russia calls to you for revenge!\"<br />\nLittle wonder that the Club didn't cut such a fancy<br />\nfigure in campus respect.<br />\nThis fact has apparently been grasped by Richard<br />\nFeise, new Dresident of the group. When he addressed the first meeting of the year last Friday he<br />\nurged a more active part upon the undergraduates<br />\npresent, who constituted practically the entire attendance. If the membership as well can be brought<br />\nto a realization of this and if the same calibre of<br />\nspeaker as has come in the past continues, the prospect for achieving a worthwhile influence is considerably enhanced. A university such as the Johns Hopkins cannot afford to be without such an influence<br />\namong the students, and we look forward to an intelligent fulfillment by the Club of our expectations.<br /><br />\nIntercollegiate News<br />\nA certain freshman football star at the University of Oklahoma worried about breaking his threeyear record for regular Sunday school attendance<br />\nwhen he was confined to his room following a tonsil<br />\noperation.
