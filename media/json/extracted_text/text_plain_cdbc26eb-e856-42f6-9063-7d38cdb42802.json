It<br />\nmakes no difference whether a<br />\nstudent cleans out rat cages or test<br />\ntubes or transplants frog embryo<br />\neyes or operates a spectrometer.<br />\nHe is still only a lab technician and<br />\nnot a researcher. It may seem that<br />\nwe are quibbling over semantics<br />\nbut professional life is filled with<br />\nmany examples of this. Since we<br />\nall seem to be so medically<br />\noriented here, we'll draw an<br />\nexample from medicine. Dr.<br />\nMichael E. DeBakey has said that<br />\n\"cardiovascular surgery is merely<br />\nplumbing, very exquisite plumbing,<br />\nbut plumbing nonetheless.\" A<br />\nsurgeon who is technically<br />\ncompetent and little else is called<br />\nnot a good surgeon but a good<br />\ntechnician. This analogy can be<br />\napplied to most undergraduate<br />\nresearch at Hopkins.<br />\nWe are not so naive as to believe<br />\nthat faculty members who sponsor<br />\nresearch are unaware of this<br />\nsituation. Yet they not only allow<br />\nit but encourage it. Could it be<br />\nbecause they cannot afford to pay<br />\nlaboratory technicians and that<br />\nstudents are an all-too-willing and<br />\navailable source of cheap labor? If<br />\nthis is the case students and faculty<br />\nare taking mutual advantage of<br />\neach other.<br />\nWe do not mean to say that the<br />\nacquisition of technical skill is<br />\nunimportant; it is extremely<br />\nimportant. But true research<br />\nrequires much more than technical<br />\nskill. It requires among other<br />\nthings a child-like wonder at the<br />\nintricacies of nature, a creative and<br />\ninquisitive mind and true devotion<br />\nto the pursuit of knowledge (not<br />\nthe pursuit of medical school).<br />\nWhat we question is not<br />\nundergraduates' participation in<br />\nresearch per se, but their<br />\nmotivation for it. We are not<br />\ninterested in criticizing students so<br />\nmuch as the environment which<br />\ncompels them to engage in such<br />\npractices.<br />\nWe think it's about time we<br />\nwe re intellectually honest with<br />\nourselves and stop doing things<br />\nunder false pretenses. What we<br />\npropose is that academic credit for<br />\nwhat has heretofor been called<br />\nundergraduate research be either<br />\ntotally eliminated or drastically<br />\nmodified. It is our belief that most<br />\n<br />\nChile: ITT & Black<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 ,...'',.

The Jack Anderson<br />\nMemos clearly reveal that ITT was<br />\nintent upon fomenting a military<br />\ncoup. ITT's offer of one million<br />\ndollars to the CIA to intervene in<br />\nChile is a damning indictment of<br />\nITT's policies.<br />\nAs a member of the Executive<br />\nCommittee of ITT, you are<br />\npresumably aware of the<br />\ncompany's Machiavellian activities<br />\nin Chile. In the absence of any<br />\ndenial from you, we must presume<br />\nthat these policies met with your<br />\napproval.

They are, however,<br />\nvery hard to come by. Almost no<br />\none wants to be quoted. There is a<br />\nfear of reknown. A Black student<br />\nin the limelight when not an Uncle<br />\nTom and who is willing to speak<br />\nout, is sure to lose. There are<br />\nexamples of students who did<br />\nspeak out and paid a price for their<br />\n\"militancy\". Credits lost, grades<br />\nincorrect, and financial aid hassles,<br />\nall are the signs of the University's<br />\nimpatience with \"unruly black\".<br />\nThe irony lies in the. fact that you<br />\ncan't prove that anything is wrong.<br />\n\"It's the sort of thing that happens<br />\nto anybody. You can't prove a<br />\nsingle thing by it\" said one. It goes<br />\nunnoticed that the one student it<br />\nall happens to is the one who<br />\nspoke out, who dared to contradict<br />\nthe theories of Black Intellectual<br />\ninferiority as expounded by certain<br />\nprofessors here, or the one who<br />\ndared to disagree with the image of<br />\nBlack being painted in the Politcal<br />\nScience and History classes here.<br />\nThe product then is fear, silence.<br />\nambiguity, and most of all, an<br />\nunwillingness to talk about one of<br />\nthe major problems facing modern<br />\ncivilization and how it relates to<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nNow again, the atmosphere is<br />\ntense. Signs of discomfort and<br />\ndiscontentment are on the rise, and<br />\nsuddenly someone wants some<br />\nanswers. The answers are not to be<br />\nfound. A visit to Admissions<br />\nproduces more questions than<br />\nanswers. There is flattery for my<br />\n<br />\n$a<br />\n<br />\nresult, Mr. Henderson surveyed the fruits ofhis efforts, and found that he<br />\nhad been reduced to a series of personal opinions, obviously all of which<br />\ncannot express the views of the black population on this campus-or<br />\npresent the problem with alacrity to the white population. In reading his<br />\narticle, however, one must remember that personal opinions are never<br />\nentirely personal, that they grow entirely from personal experience and<br />\nfrom the garnered thoughts and reactions of those around us.<br />\nJRS<br />\nintellect, an explanation of the<br />\ncomplex problems of admissions,<br />\nand assurances that all is being<br />\ndone to facilitate the entrance of<br />\nqualified Blacks. But there are no<br />\nstatistics, no quotations and no<br />\ndefinitive answer to the question<br />\nabout the different totals coming<br />\nout of the admissions office<br />\nthrough various sources. As I sat<br />\nand listened quite intently to what<br />\nwas being siad, I found myself<br />\ncynical and suspecting the presence<br />\nof a well planned alibi. The<br />\npresence of the Black Staff<br />\nmember does nothing to give me<br />\nreassurance. There is a feeling of<br />\npressure to quiet down my<br />\ninquisitiveness and discourage<br />\nfurther action.<br />\nThe answer lies somewhere in<br />\nthe puzzle of American politics, in<br />\nthe riddle of \"equal opportunity<br />\neducation\". Yet through the maze<br />\nof all this, there is an attempt<br />\namong Blacks to form a political<br />\nand social unity, which facilitates<br />\nthe rise of the Black educated.<br />\nThe symbol of this rise should<br />\nbe The Hopkins Black Student<br />\nUnion, a rather interesting organ<br />\nbecause of the complexities it<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\ninitiates. However, it provides the<br />\nplatform for analyzing the types of<br />\nBlacks that come to Hopkins. I<br />\ntend to think that most of the<br />\nBlacks here are not from the<br />\nghetto, i.e. urban pockets of lower<br />\nclass and lower middle class Blacks,<br />\nnor can they identify with the<br />\nsymbolic and cultural importance<br />\nwhich the ghetto has assumed. In<br />\nshort, there is a total identification<br />\nwith white middle class values.<br />\nMedical school or law school, cars,<br />\nbig houses, and all the other<br />\nmaterial symbols of power are the<br />\naim. Blacks have now accepted<br />\ntendencies that are totally alien to<br />\nthe nature of community as was<br />\nshared by our ancestors.<br />\nNow instead of unity, there is<br />\ndivision, because of political<br />\nideology, dress, academic major,<br />\nchoice of friends, and all those<br />\nother factors that characterize<br />\npetty squabbling. This leaves the<br />\nUnion weak and quite vulnerable<br />\nto adverse opinion. When we think<br />\nabout the question of<br />\ndiscrimination in housing in the<br />\nHomewood area, when we think<br />\nabout the atmosphere of<br />\ninferiority which the image of an<br />\n<br />\n\u201eA W''\u2018, ,Iv/\u2022\u2022\u202200w,,,, ,<br />\n,v%<br />\n'<br />\nSala<br />\n<br />\nWe cat:trtot_be_ex_neted to rnalce<br />\ncfi the<br />\nother<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\nchairman of the weekend told me<br />\nthat she had cancelled a scheduled<br />\nweeklong art exhibition because<br />\nshe was told that \"someone might<br />\npunch a hole in one of the<br />\npaintings\". No one ever threatens<br />\nto punch holes in the paintings<br />\nthat hang in the Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary. It is these acts of<br />\nneanderthal maturity that instigate<br />\nhostility.<br />\nSuddenly, we're soaring with<br />\ndreams of progess, and just as<br />\nsuddenly, it all goes down the<br />\ndrain. In any case, deep down we<br />\nknow that Hopkins is \"safe\". The<br />\nBlack population can be figured<br />\ninto a two digit number. What that<br />\nnumber is, nobody is sure, but the<br />\nstrength that comes in numbers<br />\ncannot be found here.<br />\nIn effect, what we have is a<br />\nsituation that may never change, or<br />\nit may get worse. Perhaps if people<br />\ncared enough to try to just<br />\ncooperate, it wouldn't be so bad. I<br />\ncould have written a long editorial<br />\non the sins of the \"White devil\"<br />\nagainst \"Black Humanity\". In fact,<br />\nI was tempted to do that, but<br />\nwhen you think about it, it really<br />\nserves no purpose. But I will not<br />\ngrovel on my Knees and beg for<br />\nyour acceptance. I only hope to<br />\nstimulate your minds to thought,<br />\nto initiate some self inspection<br />\namong all of you.

A quirk<br />\nin the scheduling this year shifted<br />\nthe Virginia game to the March<br />\n16 date leaving this weekend<br />\nopen for the 54th contest in this<br />\nseries.<br />\nMount Washington has<br />\nhistorically bee<br />\nthe most<br />\nsuccessful foe to take on the Blue<br />\nJays, as they now own a 34-17<br />\nedge in the rivalry, which has<br />\nseen two ties However. Hopkins<br />\nhas won three of the last four<br />\ngames between the two.

All three had many<br />\nmemorable moments on the<br />\nHomewood turf for Hopkins but<br />\nreturn tonight in the adversary<br />\nrole.<br />\nOther talents have also been<br />\ninstrumental to the Wolfpack this<br />\nyear.

Nevertheless, as<br />\nlate as midway through the third<br />\nperiod, the Wolfpack was still<br />\nholding a 9-6 lead before the<br />\nsuperior conditioning of the<br />\nTerps took its toll.<br />\n<br />\nNEws-lErret<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nTrack team downs MAC champs<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nThe Hopkins Track team<br />\nscored a stunning victory over<br />\n1974 MAC Indoor champion<br />\nWeidener this Wednesday by the<br />\nscore 80-63.<br />\nThe meet was close for most<br />\nof the time, being decided in the<br />\nlast running event, the mile relay.<br />\nWhen co-captain Greenfield<br />\ncrossed the finish line, he was<br />\nmobbed by the entire team in a<br />\n<br />\nunique scene for Hopkins' track.<br />\nThis was just one of the clutch<br />\nperformances that set the stage<br />\nfor this upset.<br />\nLeading the team was triple<br />\nwinner Oscar Schreiber (Long<br />\njump, 440,220).

Under the direction<br />\nof Mack Lee, head project<br />\ncoordinator and campus<br />\norganizer, and Loyola's Mark<br />\nAtwood, the survey was initiated<br />\nfour weeks ago in an effort to<br />\nshow consumers how much and<br />\nwhere they can save money.<br />\nAccording to Mack Lee, \"The<br />\nmain purpose of the MaryPIRG<br />\ngrocery price survey is to show<br />\nhow much people can save if<br />\nsuch a survey were compiled and<br />\npublished regularly.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"We would like the Maryland<br />\nDepartment of Agriculture to<br />\ntake it upon themselves to make<br />\nsuch a survey regularly which<br />\nwould be published in the food<br />\nsections of the major<br />\nnewspapers,\" he continued.<br />\nThe survey had some results<br />\nwhich are of special interest to<br />\nthose residing in the Homewood<br />\narea. It was found that the<br />\nEddie's Market on St. Paul St.<br />\ncharged substantially more for<br />\nthe same 41 items surveyed<br />\nincluding milk, meat, canned<br />\ngoods, and fruit, than the Eddie's<br />\non 33rd Street and Greenmount<br />\nAve., and the other major stores<br />\n<br />\nin the Homewood area, including<br />\nthe A & P on Gorsuch Avenue,<br />\nthe Giant in the Rotunda and<br />\nthe Food Fair on 29th Street and<br />\nGreenmount.<br />\nOver half of the stores<br />\nsurveyed charged different prices<br />\nfor identical items. For example,<br />\nchunky peanut butter sells for<br />\n$1.19 at Eddie's. At the Giant<br />\nthis item sells for $.95. Meat<br />\nprices differ by much greater<br />\namounts: $1.49 per pound for<br />\nsirloin steak at Food Fair as<br />\ncompared to $1.99 at Eddie's.<br />\nWhen asked to comment on<br />\nthe reasons for Eddie's inflated<br />\nprices, Lee said \"It would seem<br />\n<br />\nthat the Eddie's on St. Paul St. is<br />\ntaking advantage of the fact that<br />\nthere are a lot of older people<br />\nand students without adequate<br />\ntransportation to shop at more<br />\ndistant markets.\"<br />\nLee asserted that this kind of<br />\ninformation would be very easy<br />\nfor the newspapers of<br />\nDepartment of Agriculture to<br />\nobtain. As of now, the Sunpapers<br />\npublishes a Baltimore Retail<br />\nMarket Report compiled by the<br />\nDepartment of Agriculture.<br />\nHowever, the information in the<br />\npresut form does not give the<br />\nnames of the stores which have<br />\nthe best buys.<br />\n<br />\nAs a result of the survey,<br />\nMaryPIRG has plans to consult<br />\nwith the manager of Eddie's next<br />\nweek. There are also plans to<br />\nmeet with the Maryland<br />\nSecretary of Agriculture in an<br />\neffort to enlist their cooperation<br />\nin the near future.<br />\nIt is MaryPIRG's intention,<br />\naccording to Lee, to provide for<br />\nthe consumer what would be<br />\nvirtually \"impossible for the<br />\nconsumer to do.\" Because it<br />\nwould involve inordinate<br />\namounts of gasoline and time, it<br />\nwould not be feasible for the<br />\nconsumer to do comparative<br />\nshopping on this scale.<br />\n<br />\nWhere To Buy It<br />\nPHOTOGRAPHY<br />\n<br />\nSERVICES<br />\nA Favorite Rendez-Wu<br />\nfnr Hopkins Men<br />\n<br />\nJIMMY WU'S<br />\nNEW CHINA INN<br />\nCharles Street Below 25th<br />\n<br />\nGURUKA<br />\nNatural Food Stcrc<br />\n2322 N.CbariesSt.<br />\n10% OFF<br />\n,vith this coupor<br />\n<br />\nJAI HIND<br />\nINDIAN RESTAURANT<br />\nEat - In, Carry Out<br />\n<br />\n5511 York Road<br />\n<br />\nJEN'S<br />\n<br />\nOpen for Lunch<br />\n11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.<br />\nDinner 5:30 p.m. - 11 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nPECORA'S<br />\n3320 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n889-3831<br />\n<br />\nWATER BEDS<br />\n2435 Maryland Avenue<br />\n366-6110<br />\nNOVEMBRE WATERBEDS<br />\n; We offer quality waterbeda &service..<br />\n<br />\n, THE CLOTHES HORSE<br />\n<br />\nCall 323-8440<br />\n<br />\nBOOKS<br />\n<br />\nCoverings & Nourishments<br />\nfor Mind & Body<br />\n<br />\nUsed & Rare, Old & Out-of-print<br />\n<br />\nJohn P.

Mr. Black, it seems should<br />\nresign-not because he is doing a<br />\nbad job as trustee (this is evidently<br />\nirrelevant to the committee)-but<br />\nbecause he actually dares hold<br />\nviews which are - get this different from those of the<br />\ncommittee. He should resign<br />\nbecause he is a member of the<br />\nBoard of IT!'; the thought that this<br />\nis tantamount to applying the old<br />\nguilt-by-association ploy-which<br />\nploy, if applied to the committee,<br />\nwould doubtless elicit yelps of<br />\nprotest-seemingly has not crossed<br />\nthe minds of committee members.<br />\nHe should resign because ITT<br />\nplayed a major(?) role(??) in tht,<br />\nmilitary overthrow of Allende's<br />\nMarxist paradise (so what?), yet I'll<br />\nwager that, were our military to<br />\nrise up suddenly and overthrow<br />\nNixon, the committee would don<br />\nshiny new uniforms and spit-shine<br />\nits boots on the spot. This absurd<br />\nand illogical pontificating by the<br />\nleftists and their ilk is getting to be<br />\nless than pathetic: it's become a<br />\nbore.<br />\nHey, let's conduct a seminar on<br />\nsanctimonious hypocrisy by the<br />\nLeft. We're opening anyway with<br />\nAlger Hiss the convicted perjurer<br />\nand felon; we could go on with<br />\nDanny Ellsberg (his topic would be<br />\n\"thou shalt not steal\"), bring in<br />\nthe Great McGoo (the inviolability<br />\nof duly-elected convention<br />\ndelegations), daily awhile with<br />\nHanoi Jane (the meaning of true<br />\npatriotism), rave with Bad Bill<br />\nKunstler (ethical behavior in the<br />\nlegal profession), retch with the<br />\nBerrigan boys (on keeping priestly<br />\nvows), and finally let it all come up<br />\nas we ask this \"COmmittee on<br />\nHuman Rights in Chile\" why-if<br />\ntruly concerned with the rights of<br />\nall Chileans-it was not concerned<br />\nwith the rights of the victims of<br />\nAllende's oppression, but somehow<br />\nsprang into being only when<br />\nMarxists began getting the shaft.<br />\nDick Oles<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\ni , ,.it \u2022 . ,..,\u201e<br />\n\u201eq.,11rIt'.'4<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 1.,..:11Cow,<br /><br />\nthis pf-chtVern.<br /><br />\nmedical<br /><br />\nschool.\"<br />\nThe sophistication of the<br />\ntechnical skill required in a<br />\nresearch laboratory is of little<br />\nimportance when it comes to the<br />\ndifference between a \"laboratory<br />\ntechnician\" and a \"researcher\". It<br />\nmakes no difference whether a<br />\nstudent cleans out rat cages or test<br />\ntubes or transplants frog embryo<br />\neyes or operates a spectrometer.<br />\nHe is still only a lab technician and<br />\nnot a researcher. It may seem that<br />\nwe are quibbling over semantics<br />\nbut professional life is filled with<br />\nmany examples of this. Since we<br />\nall seem to be so medically<br />\noriented here, we'll draw an<br />\nexample from medicine. Dr.<br />\nMichael E. DeBakey has said that<br />\n\"cardiovascular surgery is merely<br />\nplumbing, very exquisite plumbing,<br />\nbut plumbing nonetheless.\" A<br />\nsurgeon who is technically<br />\ncompetent and little else is called<br />\nnot a good surgeon but a good<br />\ntechnician. This analogy can be<br />\napplied to most undergraduate<br />\nresearch at Hopkins.<br />\nWe are not so naive as to believe<br />\nthat faculty members who sponsor<br />\nresearch are unaware of this<br />\nsituation. Yet they not only allow<br />\nit but encourage it. Could it be<br />\nbecause they cannot afford to pay<br />\nlaboratory technicians and that<br />\nstudents are an all-too-willing and<br />\navailable source of cheap labor? If<br />\nthis is the case students and faculty<br />\nare taking mutual advantage of<br />\neach other.<br />\nWe do not mean to say that the<br />\nacquisition of technical skill is<br />\nunimportant; it is extremely<br />\nimportant. But true research<br />\nrequires much more than technical<br />\nskill. It requires among other<br />\nthings a child-like wonder at the<br />\nintricacies of nature, a creative and<br />\ninquisitive mind and true devotion<br />\nto the pursuit of knowledge (not<br />\nthe pursuit of medical school).<br />\nWhat we question is not<br />\nundergraduates' participation in<br />\nresearch per se, but their<br />\nmotivation for it. We are not<br />\ninterested in criticizing students so<br />\nmuch as the environment which<br />\ncompels them to engage in such<br />\npractices.<br />\nWe think it's about time we<br />\nwe re intellectually honest with<br />\nourselves and stop doing things<br />\nunder false pretenses. What we<br />\npropose is that academic credit for<br />\nwhat has heretofor been called<br />\nundergraduate research be either<br />\ntotally eliminated or drastically<br />\nmodified. It is our belief that most<br /><br />\nChile: ITT &amp; Black<br /><br />\n\u2022 ,...'',.

The Jack Anderson<br />\nMemos clearly reveal that ITT was<br />\nintent upon fomenting a military<br />\ncoup. ITT's offer of one million<br />\ndollars to the CIA to intervene in<br />\nChile is a damning indictment of<br />\nITT's policies.<br />\nAs a member of the Executive<br />\nCommittee of ITT, you are<br />\npresumably aware of the<br />\ncompany's Machiavellian activities<br />\nin Chile. In the absence of any<br />\ndenial from you, we must presume<br />\nthat these policies met with your<br />\napproval. If this is the case. we<br />\nmust protest your position as a<br />\nFellow of the Board of Trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThere is an Obvious contradiction<br />\nbetween upholding policies which<br />\ndeny human rights in Chile and<br />\noccupying a position which<br />\nrequires that you defend such<br />\nrights at the University.<br />\nWe call upon you to resign from<br />\nITT, or dissociate yourself from<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nMindy G.

Almost no<br />\none wants to be quoted. There is a<br />\nfear of reknown. A Black student<br />\nin the limelight when not an Uncle<br />\nTom and who is willing to speak<br />\nout, is sure to lose. There are<br />\nexamples of students who did<br />\nspeak out and paid a price for their<br />\n\"militancy\". Credits lost, grades<br />\nincorrect, and financial aid hassles,<br />\nall are the signs of the University's<br />\nimpatience with \"unruly black\".<br />\nThe irony lies in the. fact that you<br />\ncan't prove that anything is wrong.<br />\n\"It's the sort of thing that happens<br />\nto anybody. You can't prove a<br />\nsingle thing by it\" said one. It goes<br />\nunnoticed that the one student it<br />\nall happens to is the one who<br />\nspoke out, who dared to contradict<br />\nthe theories of Black Intellectual<br />\ninferiority as expounded by certain<br />\nprofessors here, or the one who<br />\ndared to disagree with the image of<br />\nBlack being painted in the Politcal<br />\nScience and History classes here.<br />\nThe product then is fear, silence.<br />\nambiguity, and most of all, an<br />\nunwillingness to talk about one of<br />\nthe major problems facing modern<br />\ncivilization and how it relates to<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nNow again, the atmosphere is<br />\ntense. Signs of discomfort and<br />\ndiscontentment are on the rise, and<br />\nsuddenly someone wants some<br />\nanswers. The answers are not to be<br />\nfound. A visit to Admissions<br />\nproduces more questions than<br />\nanswers. There is flattery for my<br /><br />\n$a<br /><br />\nresult, Mr. Henderson surveyed the fruits ofhis efforts, and found that he<br />\nhad been reduced to a series of personal opinions, obviously all of which<br />\ncannot express the views of the black population on this campus-or<br />\npresent the problem with alacrity to the white population. In reading his<br />\narticle, however, one must remember that personal opinions are never<br />\nentirely personal, that they grow entirely from personal experience and<br />\nfrom the garnered thoughts and reactions of those around us.<br />\nJRS<br />\nintellect, an explanation of the<br />\ncomplex problems of admissions,<br />\nand assurances that all is being<br />\ndone to facilitate the entrance of<br />\nqualified Blacks. But there are no<br />\nstatistics, no quotations and no<br />\ndefinitive answer to the question<br />\nabout the different totals coming<br />\nout of the admissions office<br />\nthrough various sources. As I sat<br />\nand listened quite intently to what<br />\nwas being siad, I found myself<br />\ncynical and suspecting the presence<br />\nof a well planned alibi. The<br />\npresence of the Black Staff<br />\nmember does nothing to give me<br />\nreassurance. There is a feeling of<br />\npressure to quiet down my<br />\ninquisitiveness and discourage<br />\nfurther action.<br />\nThe answer lies somewhere in<br />\nthe puzzle of American politics, in<br />\nthe riddle of \"equal opportunity<br />\neducation\". Yet through the maze<br />\nof all this, there is an attempt<br />\namong Blacks to form a political<br />\nand social unity, which facilitates<br />\nthe rise of the Black educated.<br />\nThe symbol of this rise should<br />\nbe The Hopkins Black Student<br />\nUnion, a rather interesting organ<br />\nbecause of the complexities it<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\ninitiates. However, it provides the<br />\nplatform for analyzing the types of<br />\nBlacks that come to Hopkins. I<br />\ntend to think that most of the<br />\nBlacks here are not from the<br />\nghetto, i.e. urban pockets of lower<br />\nclass and lower middle class Blacks,<br />\nnor can they identify with the<br />\nsymbolic and cultural importance<br />\nwhich the ghetto has assumed. In<br />\nshort, there is a total identification<br />\nwith white middle class values.<br />\nMedical school or law school, cars,<br />\nbig houses, and all the other<br />\nmaterial symbols of power are the<br />\naim. Blacks have now accepted<br />\ntendencies that are totally alien to<br />\nthe nature of community as was<br />\nshared by our ancestors.<br />\nNow instead of unity, there is<br />\ndivision, because of political<br />\nideology, dress, academic major,<br />\nchoice of friends, and all those<br />\nother factors that characterize<br />\npetty squabbling. This leaves the<br />\nUnion weak and quite vulnerable<br />\nto adverse opinion. When we think<br />\nabout the question of<br />\ndiscrimination in housing in the<br />\nHomewood area, when we think<br />\nabout the atmosphere of<br />\ninferiority which the image of an<br /><br />\n\u201eA W''\u2018, ,Iv/\u2022\u2022\u202200w,,,, ,<br />\n,v%<br />\n'<br />\nSala<br /><br />\nWe cat:trtot_be_ex_neted to rnalce<br />\ncfi the<br />\nother<br />\nThe<br /><br />\nchairman of the weekend told me<br />\nthat she had cancelled a scheduled<br />\nweeklong art exhibition because<br />\nshe was told that \"someone might<br />\npunch a hole in one of the<br />\npaintings\". No one ever threatens<br />\nto punch holes in the paintings<br />\nthat hang in the Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary. It is these acts of<br />\nneanderthal maturity that instigate<br />\nhostility.<br />\nSuddenly, we're soaring with<br />\ndreams of progess, and just as<br />\nsuddenly, it all goes down the<br />\ndrain. In any case, deep down we<br />\nknow that Hopkins is \"safe\". The<br />\nBlack population can be figured<br />\ninto a two digit number. What that<br />\nnumber is, nobody is sure, but the<br />\nstrength that comes in numbers<br />\ncannot be found here.<br />\nIn effect, what we have is a<br />\nsituation that may never change, or<br />\nit may get worse. Perhaps if people<br />\ncared enough to try to just<br />\ncooperate, it wouldn't be so bad. I<br />\ncould have written a long editorial<br />\non the sins of the \"White devil\"<br />\nagainst \"Black Humanity\". In fact,<br />\nI was tempted to do that, but<br />\nwhen you think about it, it really<br />\nserves no purpose. But I will not<br />\ngrovel on my Knees and beg for<br />\nyour acceptance. I only hope to<br />\nstimulate your minds to thought,<br />\nto initiate some self inspection<br />\namong all of you.

Under the direction<br />\nof Mack Lee, head project<br />\ncoordinator and campus<br />\norganizer, and Loyola's Mark<br />\nAtwood, the survey was initiated<br />\nfour weeks ago in an effort to<br />\nshow consumers how much and<br />\nwhere they can save money.<br />\nAccording to Mack Lee, \"The<br />\nmain purpose of the MaryPIRG<br />\ngrocery price survey is to show<br />\nhow much people can save if<br />\nsuch a survey were compiled and<br />\npublished regularly.\"<br /><br />\n\"We would like the Maryland<br />\nDepartment of Agriculture to<br />\ntake it upon themselves to make<br />\nsuch a survey regularly which<br />\nwould be published in the food<br />\nsections of the major<br />\nnewspapers,\" he continued.<br />\nThe survey had some results<br />\nwhich are of special interest to<br />\nthose residing in the Homewood<br />\narea. It was found that the<br />\nEddie's Market on St. Paul St.<br />\ncharged substantially more for<br />\nthe same 41 items surveyed<br />\nincluding milk, meat, canned<br />\ngoods, and fruit, than the Eddie's<br />\non 33rd Street and Greenmount<br />\nAve., and the other major stores<br /><br />\nin the Homewood area, including<br />\nthe A &amp; P on Gorsuch Avenue,<br />\nthe Giant in the Rotunda and<br />\nthe Food Fair on 29th Street and<br />\nGreenmount.<br />\nOver half of the stores<br />\nsurveyed charged different prices<br />\nfor identical items. For example,<br />\nchunky peanut butter sells for<br />\n$1.19 at Eddie's. At the Giant<br />\nthis item sells for $.95. Meat<br />\nprices differ by much greater<br />\namounts: $1.49 per pound for<br />\nsirloin steak at Food Fair as<br />\ncompared to $1.99 at Eddie's.<br />\nWhen asked to comment on<br />\nthe reasons for Eddie's inflated<br />\nprices, Lee said \"It would seem<br /><br />\nthat the Eddie's on St. Paul St. is<br />\ntaking advantage of the fact that<br />\nthere are a lot of older people<br />\nand students without adequate<br />\ntransportation to shop at more<br />\ndistant markets.\"<br />\nLee asserted that this kind of<br />\ninformation would be very easy<br />\nfor the newspapers of<br />\nDepartment of Agriculture to<br />\nobtain. As of now, the Sunpapers<br />\npublishes a Baltimore Retail<br />\nMarket Report compiled by the<br />\nDepartment of Agriculture.<br />\nHowever, the information in the<br />\npresut form does not give the<br />\nnames of the stores which have<br />\nthe best buys.<br /><br />\nAs a result of the survey,<br />\nMaryPIRG has plans to consult<br />\nwith the manager of Eddie's next<br />\nweek. There are also plans to<br />\nmeet with the Maryland<br />\nSecretary of Agriculture in an<br />\neffort to enlist their cooperation<br />\nin the near future.<br />\nIt is MaryPIRG's intention,<br />\naccording to Lee, to provide for<br />\nthe consumer what would be<br />\nvirtually \"impossible for the<br />\nconsumer to do.\" Because it<br />\nwould involve inordinate<br />\namounts of gasoline and time, it<br />\nwould not be feasible for the<br />\nconsumer to do comparative<br />\nshopping on this scale.<br /><br />\nWhere To Buy It<br />\nPHOTOGRAPHY<br /><br />\nSERVICES<br />\nA Favorite Rendez-Wu<br />\nfnr Hopkins Men<br /><br />\nJIMMY WU'S<br />\nNEW CHINA INN<br />\nCharles Street Below 25th<br /><br />\nGURUKA<br />\nNatural Food Stcrc<br />\n2322 N.CbariesSt.<br />\n10% OFF<br />\n,vith this coupor<br /><br />\nJAI HIND<br />\nINDIAN RESTAURANT<br />\nEat - In, Carry Out<br /><br />\n5511 York Road<br /><br />\nJEN'S<br /><br />\nOpen for Lunch<br />\n11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.<br />\nDinner 5:30 p.m. - 11 p.m.<br /><br />\nPECORA'S<br />\n3320 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n889-3831<br /><br />\nWATER BEDS<br />\n2435 Maryland Avenue<br />\n366-6110<br />\nNOVEMBRE WATERBEDS<br />\n; We offer quality waterbeda &amp;service..<br /><br />\n, THE CLOTHES HORSE<br /><br />\nCall 323-8440<br /><br />\nBOOKS<br /><br />\nCoverings &amp; Nourishments<br />\nfor Mind &amp; Body<br /><br />\nUsed &amp; Rare, Old &amp; Out-of-print<br /><br />\nJohn P.
