It deals with a<br />\nvery serious problem in our society.<br />\nWilson is a senior and political science<br />\nmajor at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAuthor's Note: With the permission of<br />\nthe editors of the News-Letter, it was<br />\ndecided to limit this special report to<br />\nthe work being done on the behavior of<br />\nthe driver. Every aspect of highway<br />\nsafety is so complex that even that part<br />\nhad to be treated superficially in this<br />\nlimited space. The role of the automobile<br />\nand the roadway could not possibly be<br />\nincluded.<br />\nThe automobile has celebrated the<br />\nclassic three-score-years-and-ten on the<br />\nAmerican scene. In those few short generations it has become one of the most<br />\nthoroughly democratized parts of our<br />\nnational, every-day life; perhaps even an<br />\ninstitution. It has come to mean to the<br />\npeople who use it many things more<br />\nthan just simply a vehicle, or transportation. Its romance has blossomed beyond any rational level. It has drasticly affected the face of the land and the<br />\nhabits of our people. It has also affected<br />\nthe manner and timeliness of their demise. Its impact exceeds that of the<br />\nColt repeater on these shores during the<br />\nlast century, or that of the sailing ship<br />\nduring the Renaissance in Europe.<br />\nIts start was an inauspicious and undisciplined one. Its growth served only<br />\nto compound its lack of discipline. In<br />\n1900 there were but 8,000 automobiles<br />\non our roads, unquestionably the worst<br />\nin the Western World. By 1910 pressure<br />\nwas growing to improve the roads, and<br />\nthe Congress authorized the President<br />\nto appoint a commission to study the<br />\nproblem. Auto registration had already<br />\nreached 458,377.<br />\nIn 1900 auto production was only 4,192<br />\nunits, but by 1910, it was 181,000. An<br />\nimportant and peculiarly American thing<br />\nhad happened in the interim: Henry<br />\nFord had introduced the Model T. R. L.<br />\nBruckberger says that for us, Ford's<br />\nquiet revolution will overshadow Lenin's<br />\nviolent one. Aldous Huxley's \"Brave<br />\nNew World\" certainly projects this<br />\nthesis to the extreme, where Ford is<br />\ntreated as the Diety.<br />\nJohn B. Rae, in his scolarly history<br />\nof the American automobile in the<br />\nChicago University History of American<br />\nCivilization series says \"the fast growing<br />\nUnited States offered conditions in<br />\nwhich it was profitable to employ techniques that achieved quantity production with a minimum of labor, particularly if the high cost of skilled craftsmen could be dispensed with, and there<br />\nwere no strong vested interests to resist<br />\ninnovation.\" As early as 1850, this technique had been called \"the American<br />\nsystem of manufacture.\"<br />\n<br />\nCars for Sale<br />\nTo Everybody<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe automobile presented the \"system\" its greatest challenge yet. Until<br />\nthen, the \"system\" had been able to roll<br />\nalong easily producing pins and firearms, whiskey and furniture. The automobile was the first complex, popular<br />\ndevice to which the \"system\" could be<br />\napplied. And the complexity of the device made the commitment of the enterprises necessarily greater, the obstacles<br />\nmore numerous, and the need for<br />\nvolume production unavoidable. In the<br />\nfinal application, it was early realized<br />\nthat volume would have not only to<br />\nremain high, but to continually grow.<br />\nThis meant, eventually, that autos would<br />\nhave to be put in the hands of the<br />\nyoung and the old, the rich and the poor,<br />\nthe pillars of society and the delinquent,<br />\nthe healthy and the sick.<br />\nThe Model T was different from every<br />\nearlier \"cheap\" cars. Ford decided to<br />\nbuild a car that would first satisfy the<br />\nfarmer and the country doctor; then he<br />\nworked at cost reduction. Later, in every<br />\nOA. auto-producing country in the world,<br />\n<br />\nthe mass-car producers followed suit.<br />\nAndre Citroen told designers to come<br />\nup with a car that could carry a dozen<br />\neggs over unpaved roads without breakage, and that is how the Deux Cheveaux<br />\nwas tested. One of the characteristics of<br />\nany such car, naturally, is that you need<br />\nnot have much skill to drive one, And<br />\nthe purchaser is rarely asked by an auto<br />\ndealer to demonstrate his ability to control moving vehicles in general.<br />\nAfter World War I there were 8,131,522<br />\ncars on our highways, and by 1950 the<br />\nnumber had risen to 49,161,691. Today<br />\nthere are approximately 89,000,000. And<br />\nthe cars that have been sold have been<br />\n<br />\noperated at ever-increasing speeds by the<br />\nsame kind of people who bought the<br />\nfirst Model T. While in the period from<br />\n1949 to 1949 the average speed on American highways increased by only four<br />\nmiles an hour, the proportion of drivers<br />\ngoing faster than 50 miles an hour had<br />\nrisen from 39 per cent to 56 per cent<br />\nof the total. In 1959, about 15 per cent<br />\nof all drivers exceeded 60 miles an hour.<br />\nWhat does this proliferation of motor<br />\nvehicles mean for Americans? It means<br />\nthat when you stand on a street corner<br />\nand watch the cars go by, one in every<br />\ntwo cars will be junked because of an<br />\nauto accident. It means that one in<br />\nevery ten will kill, or have someone<br />\nkilled in it. It means that one in every<br />\nfour children born this year will be<br />\nkilled or maimed permanently in an<br />\nauto accident. It means that every single<br />\nfamily in the United States will lose at<br />\nleast one member in a traffic accident<br />\nbefore 1975.<br />\nIf you are between five and thirty<br />\nyears old it means that your chances of<br />\nbeing killed in an auto accident are<br />\ngreater than due to any other cause;<br />\nand since all Americans are computed<br />\ninto these figures, \"any other cause\" includes Viet Cong ambush. Further, it<br />\nmeans that three cents out of every dollar you spend for anything goes to pay<br />\nthe direct costs of traffic accidents\u2014<br />\nfrom replacing a fender to buying the<br />\nburial plot. Work loss and reduced production are not included in that.<br />\nThere can be no doubt that during<br />\nthe next century Americans will wonder<br />\nhow we allowed the auto death toll to<br />\ncontinue so high and so long. Just as we<br />\nlook back with shame on sweatshops<br />\nand strike-breakers, they will look back<br />\nwith horror on the casualty list that<br />\nnow tops 1,500,000 during the history of<br />\nthe automobile on these shores. In 1959,<br />\nthe Secretary of Commerce predicted<br />\nthat 51,000 would not die annually in<br />\ntraffic accidents before 1975. Now, for<br />\n1966, estimates range from 51,000 to<br />\n65,000\u2014nine years earlier than was<br />\nthought possible just seven years ago.<br />\nThe 1966 Pontiac Tempest has been<br />\ndescribed as \"an orgasm on wheels.\" In<br />\nDetroit, it is a truism that \"styling cars<br />\nsells cars, and safey does not.\" In 1956,<br />\nWilliam Mitchell of General Motors said<br />\nsafe cars appeal only to \"squares,\" \"and<br />\nthere ain't any squares no more.\" In<br />\n\"The Insolent Chariots\", John Keats runs<br />\ndown the list of the then-best-sellers and<br />\nfinds breasts and buttocks on each of<br />\nthem. Evidentally, it is sex in styling<br />\nthat sells oars, for the 1966 Pontiac<br />\n<br />\nTempest is the third selling car, yet is<br />\nfar from the third lowest priced.<br />\nThe realization that this was being<br />\ndone consciously by the auto makers<br />\nhas developed, in recent months, into a<br />\nconcentrated attack on auto design as a<br />\nfactor in auto accidents. Criticism has<br />\nbeen made of the emphasis on speed in<br />\nauto advertising. The autoindustry has<br />\nreplied by saying that they operate in<br />\none of the last fre market in America,<br />\nand in a fre market, the fact that they<br />\nare here to answer the criticism proves<br />\nthat their approach has been the correct<br />\nand democratic one. The Detroit auto<br />\nmakers are the last survivors of a<br />\ndying species\u2014the social Darwinists.<br />\nTheir critics have their valid points and<br />\nthe auto makers have their valid points.<br />\ntoo. Were cars changed so completely<br />\nthat safety were always the prime consideration, the human animal being what<br />\nhe is, he would still tend to favor the<br />\ncompany that produced a car with sex<br />\nappeal, and relative safety would have<br />\nlittle selling power. The final and only<br />\npotentially successful approach, then, to<br />\nreducing accidents, is a complete understanding of the behavior and ability<br />\nof the driver, and an intelligent and just<br />\napplication of the understanding that is<br />\nobtained.<br />\nThere are two things which exist in<br />\nour system which have traditionally<br />\ntended to inhibit the undertaking of<br />\nsuch an effort. One is \"the Problem of<br />\nthe Voter-Driver.\" The other is the inherent research gap. Both problems can<br />\nbe solved, but to solve either will require a virtual overturning of practices<br />\nand sentiment in the State legislatures<br />\nand the Congress. At which level the<br />\nneed is greatest is outside the scope of<br />\nthis special report. Suffice it to say, the<br />\nneed exists.<br />\nThe overturning has started. During<br />\nthe past twelve months more state-level<br />\nhighway safety proposals have been considered than in the preceding threescore-years-and-ten the automobile has<br />\nbeen with us. The cost of those enacted<br />\nalone is staggering, when the Federal<br />\nprograms are included, and the final<br />\nshame is that the deaths on our highways will continue to grow, or at least,<br />\nnot fall by very much, despite these efforts, until the problem if the antisocial, and extra-social, driver is tackled.<br />\n<br />\nThe Problem of<br />\nVoter-Driver<br />\n\"The Problem of the Voter-Driver\" can<br />\nbe easily stated. Although most drivers<br />\ndo not vote, they could; and most voters<br />\ndo drive. Most drivers would vote, it<br />\nis felt, if they thought their \"right\" to<br />\ndrive threatened. The \"Problem of the<br />\nVoter-Driver\" caused near-panic in the<br />\nMaryland legislature during the last session, and the legislator's fear of the<br />\nmythological problem defeated (since<br />\nlogic could not) the State's first proposal so-called \"implied consent\" law.<br />\nOne governor has been courageous<br />\nenough to tackle the fears of the problem head-on.

A<br />\nsearch gap exists between the application of non-automotive-based research<br />\ntechniques to non-automotive research<br />\ngoals and their application to auto safety research, between the development of<br />\nsensible hypotheses and the conduct of<br />\nresearch, between the availability of<br />\nfindings and their legal implementation,<br />\nand between the investigation of accidents and the development of any<br />\nreasoned corrective action. The greatest<br />\ndeficiency is probably the latter. Accidents are rarely investigated in any<br />\ndepth because of the problem of clearing the roadway and removing the injured. The easiest way out of a thorough<br />\ninvestigation for the usually undermanned police agencies is to write a ticket.<br />\n\"The interests of safety are served by<br />\nIssuing the ticket and the case is closed,\"<br />\naccording to Jeffrey O'Connell and<br />\nArthur Myers.

The National Safety<br />\nCouncil estimated that there were<br />\n11,500,000 motor vehicle accidents in<br />\n1963, but figures compiled by the Bureau<br />\nof Public Roads in Illinois would indicate that nationwide, there were nearly<br />\n40,000,000.

Moynihan disputes these assertions as well.<br />\nThey are based, he says, on the only two<br />\nreliable figures the State controls\u2014the<br />\nnumber of deaths as measured by how<br />\nmany times the coroner had to go<br />\nexamine a cadaver, and the revenues<br />\nfrom the tax upon the sale of gasoline.<br />\nBut their use to compute deaths per million vehicle miles includes one variable<br />\n\u2014average gasoline consumption.

The Public Utility Transport<br />\nCorporation of the Union of South Africa, a nationwide bus company, devised<br />\na test in which it has confidence, and<br />\nadministers it to all its drivers. According to the company, the results can not<br />\nonly predict which drivers can do the<br />\ncomplex job of driving well day-in-andday-out but which one will.

The<br />\nstate or authority would have the leeway to make standards more less stringent depending on subsequent experience on the highways.<br />\nThe reliability of such tests has come<br />\nunder question and the determination<br />\nof who would decide who should \"pass\"<br />\nand who should \"fail\" is as ticklish as<br />\nthe use of the test itself. But even<br />\nthe start that would be made by eliminating those drivers who are clearly<br />\nabeieated might have a surprisingly<br />\nbeneficial effect on highway accident<br />\netatistios.<br />\nThe education of young potentisd<br />\ndrivers and the continuing education of<br />\nolder drivers has long been irrationally<br />\nthought to have kept our highway secadent rate lawn to the level it is.

The only prior effort to determine this involved a complex device<br />\nconected to a spring loaded wire between two cars.

The RCA simulator enables technicians to create any<br />\nkind of highway situation from simple<br />\nto complex, from high-speed to urban,<br />\nfrom night to day, from single-car to<br />\nmulti-car, and froin routine to unimaginably unique.

In a<br />\nrecent nationwide test, selected drivers<br />\nwere asked to rank themselves as (1)<br />\nthe best driver on the road, (2) one of<br />\nthe best drivers on the road, (3) better<br />\nthan average, (4) slightly less competent than average, (5) considerably<br />\nless competent than average, (5) one<br />\nof the worst drivers on the road. 90<br />\nper cent of the people responding placed<br />\nthemselves in the top two categories.<br />\nNobody placed himself in category<br />\nnumber 5, and only 2 per cent placed<br />\nthemselves in category number 4. The<br />\npride and confidence, both irrational,<br />\nthat drivers feel about their driving<br />\nhabits can only be corrected through<br />\nsuch \"therapeutic\" programs.<br />\nThey must be corrected if drivers are<br />\nto be affected by efforts to educate them<br />\nInto driving beter. A know-it-all can be<br />\ntaught nothing.<br />\nUnfortunately, the most common<br />\nand well-thought-of form of continue<br />\nin,g driver education is the National<br />\nSafety Council's holiday and weekend<br />\naccident prediction. According to Die<br />\nMalfetti, the practice actually makee<br />\nthe. highways of the nation more<br />\ndangerous. The campaign is apparerste<br />\nly self-fulfilling. One of the workers<br />\nunder him at Columbia attempted to<br />\nmeasure the effect of the intelligent<br />\napproach against the gory approach<br />\nand found neither to be terribly effective<br />\n\u2014 but if anything, the intelligent<br />\napproach works better.<br />\nDr. Malfetti feels that scare campaigns<br />\nare ineffective because, among other<br />\nthings, repetition breeds immunity and<br />\ndifferent drivers react differently to<br />\ndifferent frightening thoughts and<br />\nsuggestions. Anyway, he argues, the<br />\nsense of personal invulnerability is so<br />\nstrong that even if man were rational<br />\nabout the possible results of careless<br />\ndriving, the victim will always be<br />\nassumed to be the \"other person.\"<br />\n<br />\nAntisocial Driver<br />\nOn Our Roads<br />\nMessrs. O'Connell and Myers deal<br />\nwith the need for violence in modern<br />\nsociety where the usual and traditional<br />\nthreats of famine, disease, and war<br />\nhave been largely removed from the<br />\nexperience of the common man. A<br />\nnovel published this month by Evan S.<br />\nConnell, Jr., The Diary of a Rapist,<br />\nopens with the account of an accident<br />\nthat is not an accident: \"Day after day<br />\nwe're humiliated, so why not seize the<br />\nchance?\" says Earl Summerfield in the<br />\nstory, when he observes a pedestrian<br />\nIntentionally run down. He attributes)<br />\nsuch behavior to \"revenge.\"<br />\nWas the behavior of the driver in<br />\nthe novel so anti-social that it could<br />\nonly exist in fiction? Probably in the<br />\ndirect sense, yes. But indirectly it is<br />\njust that sort of behavior that causes<br />\na driver to shoot another in a dispute<br />\nover high-beams, as happened in East<br />\nBaltimore earlier this year. And indirectly it is the same kind of antisocial behavior that can be blamed for<br />\nmost highway deaths and accidents.<br />\nThe most important anti-sooial driver<br />\nis the alcoholic.<br />\nThe social drinker for a long time<br />\ntook more than his share of the blame<br />\nfor auto accidents and the laws govern-<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE EIGHT<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\ndog driving while drunk still reflect<br />\nAccording<br />\nmisconception.<br />\nthe<br />\nthis<br />\nMessrs. O'Connell and Myers the<br />\nalcoholic figures too consistently in<br />\nfatal and serious accidents to be conMetered in the same category with the<br />\nsocial drinker who has his first minor<br />\naccident.<br />\nIn Dade County, .Florida, an eightyear study revealed that 47 per cent<br />\nof all traffic victims had been drinking, that 45 per cent pf all pedestrian<br />\nvictims over fifteen had. been drinking, and that among drivers in singleoar fatal accidents, .68 per cent had<br />\nbeen drinking. 92 per cent of the drinking drivers were found clearly at fault<br />\ncompared with 61 per cent for nondrinking drivers. In California the<br />\nfigures are oonsistent with these except<br />\nthat among pedestrians killed, 59 per<br />\ncent had been drinking in the 15 to 64<br />\nyear old category. In New Jersey. 89<br />\nper cent of the persons who had been<br />\ndrinking when involved in a fatal<br />\naccident had consumed three or more<br />\ndrinks. At least 47 per cent had consumed more than seven drinks.<br />\nDeterrence is a concept of law. that<br />\nIs inapplicable and unworkable when<br />\nthe drunk is the target. Emotional<br />\nweaknesses that go to make up an<br />\nalcoholic being what they are, they do<br />\nnot permit rational deterrence to work<br />\nIts effect. Yet the entire approach to<br />\nthe treatment of the alcoholic driver<br />\nis one of deterrence, punishment, and<br />\nthe eventual return of him to a<br />\n\"normal\" drink-and-drive life. Traffic<br />\nsafety is far from the only field where<br />\na complete reappraisal of alcoholism is<br />\nneeded, but it is the field where a<br />\nrepositioning, if delayed, can cost<br />\nthousands of lives.<br />\nJuries rarely convict the apprehended drunk driver unless a \"scientific\"<br />\nproof of intoxication such as a blood<br />\nanalysis or a breath test is made. Even<br />\nthen they often acquit because there<br />\nLa rarely a man among them who has<br />\nnot driven while drunk at least once.<br />\nThe Maryland Insurance Traffic Safety<br />\nCommittee, in its \"Thirteen Steps to<br />\nTraffic Safety\" advocates a so-called<br />\n\"implied consent\" law such as the one<br />\ndefeated in the last session of the General Assembly. Sixteen states have already instituted the \"implied consent\"<br />\nlaw and its oonstitutionality has been<br />\nupheld on several occasions. Essentially it is a deterrent law, but a good<br />\nImmediate effect of such an act would<br />\nbe to gradually rid Maryland roads of<br />\nextremely drunken drivers. As it would<br />\nbe used at present, the law would be<br />\n\"fair\" in that few \"social drinkers,\" if<br />\nany, could be \"persecuted\" by it.<br />\n<br />\nEvidence Law<br />\nLax on Drunks<br />\nThe amount of alcohol which is considered evidence of intoxication is imrealisticly high. In Maryland, as in most<br />\nstates the blood must contain .15 parts<br />\nto convict if a test is acitninistered.<br />\nMedical experts claim that impairment<br />\nMarts at .05 parts and intoxication at<br />\n10. New York state, acting on this<br />\nMaim, recently lowered Its evidence<br />\nrequirements for intoxioation to .10, and<br />\nestablished a lesser offense of \"impaired<br />\ndriving\" which can be proven by a .05<br />\n10 .10 count, For a 160-pound driver,<br />\nbetween two and three good-sized drinks<br />\nWill produce a count of .05; between<br />\nfour and five, a count of .10; and between six and seven, a count of .16.<br />\nWherever an implied consent law is<br />\nenacted, the standards for conviction<br />\nShould be realistic in order for justice<br />\nio be done both for the majority at<br />\nthe drivers and the alcoholic driver.<br />\nDuring 1962, in Dade County, 44 per<br />\noent of the innocent non-drinking<br />\ndrivers who were killedt In accidents<br />\n<br />\nwere killed by drivers who had been<br />\ndrinking and were clearly at fault. This<br />\nhas social implications which clearly<br />\nextend beyond the drinker. The teetotaler is threatened by the drinking<br />\ndriver. Whereas the implied consent<br />\nlaws and the realistic standards of<br />\nintoxication are deterrent laws, and are<br />\ndesigned to get the drunk off the road<br />\nwhen caught, a greater social service<br />\ncan be performed by never letting him<br />\nout on It. It is this which the so-called<br />\n\"dram shop act\" attempts to do.<br />\nEssentially, the bartender or saloonkeeper is made his brother's keeper.<br />\nWhile deterrence is not effective<br />\nagainst a drunkard or dope addict, the<br />\ndram shop act aims at a business and<br />\nthere is reason to believe that businesses<br />\nare more effectively deterred because<br />\nthey are more \"rational;\" they wish<br />\nonly to make money and do not have<br />\noverriding emotional disturbances.

If licensing<br />\nis made Federally controlled as has been<br />\nsuggested, most experts are certain that<br />\na periodic physical examination will be<br />\neffected. They, too, a finger on each<br />\ndriver's psychological pulse would be<br />\nthe only way to prevent the effort from<br />\nbeing half-hearted, and therefore unsuccessful, though more costly.<br />\nThat would take care of slowly-developing and easily detectable long-term<br />\nimpairments.

O'Connell and<br />\nMyers, the real problem lies in correcting the underlying emotional defect<br />\nthat makes of a man an alcoholic.<br />\nSome researchers have found that<br />\nmany non-drinking drivers who have<br />\nserious accidents have them according<br />\nto a schedule that approximates the<br />\nfrequency experienced by alcoholics. A<br />\nfurther examination revealed that the<br />\ncauses of the non-drinker's emotional<br />\nupset which led to the accidents were<br />\nstrikingly similar to the causes of<br />\nalcoholism in the alcoholics. Most<br />\ncommon were marital conflict and<br />\nfinancial worry.<br />\nAccidents, according to yet another<br />\nresearcher, breed accidenta. Research<br />\nthat was originally conducted on airplane pilots by D. A. Horn has been<br />\nrecently applied to drivers by Morris<br />\nS. Sohulinger. After the first accident,<br />\nthe chances are extremely high for 30<br />\ndays that the driver will be a second.<br />\nThen the chances drop to below average<br />\nthat the driver will have a second until<br />\nhe does. After it, for about 30 days,<br />\nchances are astronomically high that<br />\nhe will be involved in a third accident,<br />\nand so forth.<br />\nIn recently extending its services to<br />\nmigrant workers who drive around the<br />\ncountry in search of work, the National<br />\nTravelers Aid Association said the<br />\n\"material problems at hunger, joblessness, and homeleasnees\" are a serious<br />\nsafety hasard and the broken-down<br />\njalopy of a worker diverts highway<br />\npatrolmen from other critical duties.<br />\nJust as the elimination of alcoholism,<br />\nand deep-seated emotional disturbances,<br />\nwould make our highways eater, X<br />\nshould be dear that the ultimate, hopefully rapid and certainly inevitable ellinitiation of poverty in America will<br />\n<br />\nporary impairment such as intorication,<br />\nextreme depression, or just plain inattention. Columbia. University has developed an electronic device which<br />\nwarns the driver if his co-ordination<br />\nfells below a predetermined level. If he<br />\ncontinues to operate the car, and does<br />\nnot improve, the device shuts off the<br />\npower to the engine. Dr. Malfetti says<br />\n\"there is no moraliing; control is seized<br />\nwhen he is demonstrably deficient.\" If<br />\nthe driver is merely being inattentive,<br />\nreaching into the glove compartment or<br />\nsmacking a child in the back seat, then<br />\nthe warning will suffice. Voluntariness<br />\nin driver participation in safe practices<br />\nhas never worked satisfactorially. Just<br />\nas seat-belts, which must be actively<br />\nused, are lees comprehensive than the<br />\nMartin air-bag restraint system, which<br />\nworks automatioally when needed, the<br />\nColumbia device can Lake up where the<br />\ndram shop act, the implied consent law,<br />\nand plain social responsibility and maturity break down.<br />\nThere can be no question but that<br />\nthe universal installation of such a device would oompletely alter the social<br />\nhabits of Americans as much as the<br />\nrigid and severe drunk driving laws in<br />\nScandinavia have changed those people's party-going and bar-hopping<br />\nhabits in ten years. It would be hoped<br />\nthe much talked-of mass public transport; systems can be efficient when such<br />\ndevices are installed in passenger oars.<br />\nJust as the automobile represents<br />\nfreedom for the teenager or independence for the elderly driver, for the<br />\naverage driver, it represents anonymity<br />\nIn a society which does not normally<br />\nlet him make a move without recording<br />\nand reporting fame aspect of his actions. According to the overall findings<br />\nof the Columbia project, this anonymity<br />\nmay be the main reason why the repeated admonitione to drive safely and<br />\n\"be II responsible citizen\" have little<br />\neffect. One answer has been suggestedc<br />\nuse name-bearing license-plates. But in<br />\nan area where large numbers of people<br />\nuse crowded arterial highways and<br />\n<br />\nbeltways, this is no solution. Furthermore, it is probably of less importance<br />\nto police and other drivers to know<br />\nthat the owner of a car is John Jones<br />\nthan to know that the driver Is an<br />\nelderly driver, a convicted violator, an<br />\ninexperienced student, or a teenager.<br />\nPoor driving, when eliminated. the<br />\nColumbia researchers concluded, will<br />\nnot automatically leave good driving.<br />\nThis is one of the reasons that the<br />\npunative approach has not worked. The<br />\nColumbia group has concluded that in<br />\nlearning anything, including responsible<br />\ndriving habits, punishment is less effective than reward. Punishment merely<br />\ntends to suppress rather than eliminate<br />\nexisting bad habits. The effects of punishment are not so long remembered as<br />\nwas thought in the little red schoolhouse days. The scare campaign of the<br />\nNational Safety Council offered no reward in proper behavior considered by<br />\nthe holiday driver of any consequence<br />\nto him. Threat of death 16 not a punishment anyway, because no one has<br />\nexperienced death and been in a position to learn anything from it.<br />\nFairfax<br />\nCounty. Virginia, broke<br />\nground along the lines Columbia said<br />\nmight be effective. There, students who<br />\ndo well in driver training get a bumper<br />\nsticker labelling their car as \"date-approved.\" The stickers are avidly sought<br />\nafter. This could be easily expanded on<br />\na Statewide or nationwide basis into a<br />\nGraded Permit Plaque System. It would<br />\nbe a combination of two isolated and<br />\nspecialized systems already in use; the<br />\nSports Car Club of America graded<br />\ndriver's permit system, and the Army's<br />\nstaff car rank identification plaques.<br />\nDrivers would be issued licenses that<br />\nwere probationary at first. At each periodic re-examination, the driver could be<br />\nre-evaluated upwards through a series<br />\nof increasingly prestigious licensing<br />\ncategories, or downward if ability or<br />\ntraffic record indicated the advisability<br />\nof that. Each category would have driving privileges over and above the categories below it. For example, the elderly<br />\ndriver would not be allowed to drive<br />\nover 50 miles art hour, or on superhighways that were designated closed to<br />\nthem, or after dark except in emergencies. The plaque would fit a standardized bracket on every car. No car could<br />\nbe operated without a plaque. The<br />\nplaques would represent the driver, not<br />\nthe car, as do license plates.<br />\n<br />\nPremium Placed<br />\nOn Courtesy<br />\nEach plaque would be distinctive in<br />\ndesign, and the most prestigious would<br />\nbe issued in reasonably limited numbers<br />\nonly to drivers with impeccable reoords,<br />\ncould, for example, be a checioered<br />\nflag. It would have no privileges over<br />\nthe \"expert\" or \"experienced\" driver's<br />\nplaque, but would place a premium of<br />\ncourtesy and safety, for it could be recalled by the issuing authority on the<br />\nmere receipt of a complaint, pending hivestigation. Plaques would be serially<br />\nnumbered with the driver's permit, and<br />\nsevere penalties for transferring or<br />\nstealing them would be imposed.<br />\nbalanced<br />\nA<br />\napproach,<br />\nnot<br />\na<br />\none-sided attack on the role of the vehicle, or a costly effort to improve the<br />\nroads to the neglect of the driver, is<br />\nwhat is needed.

It deals with a<br />\nvery serious problem in our society.<br />\nWilson is a senior and political science<br />\nmajor at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAuthor's Note: With the permission of<br />\nthe editors of the News-Letter, it was<br />\ndecided to limit this special report to<br />\nthe work being done on the behavior of<br />\nthe driver. Every aspect of highway<br />\nsafety is so complex that even that part<br />\nhad to be treated superficially in this<br />\nlimited space. The role of the automobile<br />\nand the roadway could not possibly be<br />\nincluded.<br />\nThe automobile has celebrated the<br />\nclassic three-score-years-and-ten on the<br />\nAmerican scene. In those few short generations it has become one of the most<br />\nthoroughly democratized parts of our<br />\nnational, every-day life; perhaps even an<br />\ninstitution. It has come to mean to the<br />\npeople who use it many things more<br />\nthan just simply a vehicle, or transportation. Its romance has blossomed beyond any rational level. It has drasticly affected the face of the land and the<br />\nhabits of our people. It has also affected<br />\nthe manner and timeliness of their demise. Its impact exceeds that of the<br />\nColt repeater on these shores during the<br />\nlast century, or that of the sailing ship<br />\nduring the Renaissance in Europe.<br />\nIts start was an inauspicious and undisciplined one. Its growth served only<br />\nto compound its lack of discipline. In<br />\n1900 there were but 8,000 automobiles<br />\non our roads, unquestionably the worst<br />\nin the Western World. By 1910 pressure<br />\nwas growing to improve the roads, and<br />\nthe Congress authorized the President<br />\nto appoint a commission to study the<br />\nproblem. Auto registration had already<br />\nreached 458,377.<br />\nIn 1900 auto production was only 4,192<br />\nunits, but by 1910, it was 181,000. An<br />\nimportant and peculiarly American thing<br />\nhad happened in the interim: Henry<br />\nFord had introduced the Model T. R. L.<br />\nBruckberger says that for us, Ford's<br />\nquiet revolution will overshadow Lenin's<br />\nviolent one. Aldous Huxley's \"Brave<br />\nNew World\" certainly projects this<br />\nthesis to the extreme, where Ford is<br />\ntreated as the Diety.<br />\nJohn B. Rae, in his scolarly history<br />\nof the American automobile in the<br />\nChicago University History of American<br />\nCivilization series says \"the fast growing<br />\nUnited States offered conditions in<br />\nwhich it was profitable to employ techniques that achieved quantity production with a minimum of labor, particularly if the high cost of skilled craftsmen could be dispensed with, and there<br />\nwere no strong vested interests to resist<br />\ninnovation.\" As early as 1850, this technique had been called \"the American<br />\nsystem of manufacture.\"<br /><br />\nCars for Sale<br />\nTo Everybody<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe automobile presented the \"system\" its greatest challenge yet. Until<br />\nthen, the \"system\" had been able to roll<br />\nalong easily producing pins and firearms, whiskey and furniture. The automobile was the first complex, popular<br />\ndevice to which the \"system\" could be<br />\napplied. And the complexity of the device made the commitment of the enterprises necessarily greater, the obstacles<br />\nmore numerous, and the need for<br />\nvolume production unavoidable. In the<br />\nfinal application, it was early realized<br />\nthat volume would have not only to<br />\nremain high, but to continually grow.<br />\nThis meant, eventually, that autos would<br />\nhave to be put in the hands of the<br />\nyoung and the old, the rich and the poor,<br />\nthe pillars of society and the delinquent,<br />\nthe healthy and the sick.<br />\nThe Model T was different from every<br />\nearlier \"cheap\" cars. Ford decided to<br />\nbuild a car that would first satisfy the<br />\nfarmer and the country doctor; then he<br />\nworked at cost reduction. Later, in every<br />\nOA. auto-producing country in the world,<br /><br />\nthe mass-car producers followed suit.<br />\nAndre Citroen told designers to come<br />\nup with a car that could carry a dozen<br />\neggs over unpaved roads without breakage, and that is how the Deux Cheveaux<br />\nwas tested. One of the characteristics of<br />\nany such car, naturally, is that you need<br />\nnot have much skill to drive one, And<br />\nthe purchaser is rarely asked by an auto<br />\ndealer to demonstrate his ability to control moving vehicles in general.<br />\nAfter World War I there were 8,131,522<br />\ncars on our highways, and by 1950 the<br />\nnumber had risen to 49,161,691. Today<br />\nthere are approximately 89,000,000. And<br />\nthe cars that have been sold have been<br /><br />\noperated at ever-increasing speeds by the<br />\nsame kind of people who bought the<br />\nfirst Model T. While in the period from<br />\n1949 to 1949 the average speed on American highways increased by only four<br />\nmiles an hour, the proportion of drivers<br />\ngoing faster than 50 miles an hour had<br />\nrisen from 39 per cent to 56 per cent<br />\nof the total. In 1959, about 15 per cent<br />\nof all drivers exceeded 60 miles an hour.<br />\nWhat does this proliferation of motor<br />\nvehicles mean for Americans? It means<br />\nthat when you stand on a street corner<br />\nand watch the cars go by, one in every<br />\ntwo cars will be junked because of an<br />\nauto accident. It means that one in<br />\nevery ten will kill, or have someone<br />\nkilled in it. It means that one in every<br />\nfour children born this year will be<br />\nkilled or maimed permanently in an<br />\nauto accident. It means that every single<br />\nfamily in the United States will lose at<br />\nleast one member in a traffic accident<br />\nbefore 1975.<br />\nIf you are between five and thirty<br />\nyears old it means that your chances of<br />\nbeing killed in an auto accident are<br />\ngreater than due to any other cause;<br />\nand since all Americans are computed<br />\ninto these figures, \"any other cause\" includes Viet Cong ambush. Further, it<br />\nmeans that three cents out of every dollar you spend for anything goes to pay<br />\nthe direct costs of traffic accidents\u2014<br />\nfrom replacing a fender to buying the<br />\nburial plot. Work loss and reduced production are not included in that.<br />\nThere can be no doubt that during<br />\nthe next century Americans will wonder<br />\nhow we allowed the auto death toll to<br />\ncontinue so high and so long. Just as we<br />\nlook back with shame on sweatshops<br />\nand strike-breakers, they will look back<br />\nwith horror on the casualty list that<br />\nnow tops 1,500,000 during the history of<br />\nthe automobile on these shores. In 1959,<br />\nthe Secretary of Commerce predicted<br />\nthat 51,000 would not die annually in<br />\ntraffic accidents before 1975. Now, for<br />\n1966, estimates range from 51,000 to<br />\n65,000\u2014nine years earlier than was<br />\nthought possible just seven years ago.<br />\nThe 1966 Pontiac Tempest has been<br />\ndescribed as \"an orgasm on wheels.\" In<br />\nDetroit, it is a truism that \"styling cars<br />\nsells cars, and safey does not.\" In 1956,<br />\nWilliam Mitchell of General Motors said<br />\nsafe cars appeal only to \"squares,\" \"and<br />\nthere ain't any squares no more.\" In<br />\n\"The Insolent Chariots\", John Keats runs<br />\ndown the list of the then-best-sellers and<br />\nfinds breasts and buttocks on each of<br />\nthem. Evidentally, it is sex in styling<br />\nthat sells oars, for the 1966 Pontiac<br /><br />\nTempest is the third selling car, yet is<br />\nfar from the third lowest priced.<br />\nThe realization that this was being<br />\ndone consciously by the auto makers<br />\nhas developed, in recent months, into a<br />\nconcentrated attack on auto design as a<br />\nfactor in auto accidents. Criticism has<br />\nbeen made of the emphasis on speed in<br />\nauto advertising. The autoindustry has<br />\nreplied by saying that they operate in<br />\none of the last fre market in America,<br />\nand in a fre market, the fact that they<br />\nare here to answer the criticism proves<br />\nthat their approach has been the correct<br />\nand democratic one. The Detroit auto<br />\nmakers are the last survivors of a<br />\ndying species\u2014the social Darwinists.<br />\nTheir critics have their valid points and<br />\nthe auto makers have their valid points.<br />\ntoo. Were cars changed so completely<br />\nthat safety were always the prime consideration, the human animal being what<br />\nhe is, he would still tend to favor the<br />\ncompany that produced a car with sex<br />\nappeal, and relative safety would have<br />\nlittle selling power. The final and only<br />\npotentially successful approach, then, to<br />\nreducing accidents, is a complete understanding of the behavior and ability<br />\nof the driver, and an intelligent and just<br />\napplication of the understanding that is<br />\nobtained.<br />\nThere are two things which exist in<br />\nour system which have traditionally<br />\ntended to inhibit the undertaking of<br />\nsuch an effort. One is \"the Problem of<br />\nthe Voter-Driver.\" The other is the inherent research gap. Both problems can<br />\nbe solved, but to solve either will require a virtual overturning of practices<br />\nand sentiment in the State legislatures<br />\nand the Congress. At which level the<br />\nneed is greatest is outside the scope of<br />\nthis special report. Suffice it to say, the<br />\nneed exists.<br />\nThe overturning has started. During<br />\nthe past twelve months more state-level<br />\nhighway safety proposals have been considered than in the preceding threescore-years-and-ten the automobile has<br />\nbeen with us. The cost of those enacted<br />\nalone is staggering, when the Federal<br />\nprograms are included, and the final<br />\nshame is that the deaths on our highways will continue to grow, or at least,<br />\nnot fall by very much, despite these efforts, until the problem if the antisocial, and extra-social, driver is tackled.<br /><br />\nThe Problem of<br />\nVoter-Driver<br />\n\"The Problem of the Voter-Driver\" can<br />\nbe easily stated. Although most drivers<br />\ndo not vote, they could; and most voters<br />\ndo drive. Most drivers would vote, it<br />\nis felt, if they thought their \"right\" to<br />\ndrive threatened. The \"Problem of the<br />\nVoter-Driver\" caused near-panic in the<br />\nMaryland legislature during the last session, and the legislator's fear of the<br />\nmythological problem defeated (since<br />\nlogic could not) the State's first proposal so-called \"implied consent\" law.<br />\nOne governor has been courageous<br />\nenough to tackle the fears of the problem head-on. North Carolina's Dan<br />\nMoore took a tough line in a special<br />\naddress to the State's General Assembly<br />\nsaying \"We must not, we cannot, let<br />\nindividual inconvenience block our determination. Neither you nor I can afford to let our political ambition stand<br />\nin the way. Our obligation to the men,<br />\nwomen, and children of North Carolina,<br />\ndemands that we take firm action now,\"<br />\nGovernor Moore backed his words<br />\npith actions that put the Maryland administration to shame. An inspection<br />\nlaw, doubled driver education appropriations, increased highway patrolmen<br />\nauthoritizations, centralized highway<br />\nsafety authorities and accident research<br />\nprograms, traffic court reforms, and<br />\nseveral technical laws governing vehicle<br />\nequipment were enacted. Dan Moore is<br />\nnot the first Governor to tackle the<br />\nproblem but he will probably be recorded as the first effective one in a<br />\ngreat renewed untertaking. And he will<br />\nprobably be able to report that the<br />\nProblem of the Voter-Driver was<br /><br />\nPAGE SIX<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nagined\u2014as Abraham R,ibicoff was able<br />\nto do some years ago.<br />\nRibicoff \"moved up\" from Governor to<br />\nSenator despite the feared wrath of<br />\nVoter-Drivers in his state. He recently<br />\nmade the statement \"As Governor of<br />\nConnecticut, I launched the toughest<br />\nhighway safety program in the nation.<br />\nToday Connecticut has the lowest traffic accident death rate of any State\u2014<br />\nand'I'm proud of it.\" If Senator Ribicoff was hurt by any of his programs as<br />\nGovernor, he has not learned his lesson,<br />\nfor his Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization is in the forefront of the<br />\ncurrent dispute between the Congress<br />\nand the auto industry and its ancillary<br />\nenterprises.<br />\nThe threat of losing the driving \"right\"<br />\nis virtually unthinkable to most voters<br />\naccording to a 1957 Gallup Poll. Gallup's<br />\nInstitute of Public Opinon reported that<br />\ndrivers \"are in the mood to accept<br />\ndrastic measures designed to reduce the<br />\nnumber of street and highway accidents,\" because, according to the Secretary of Commerce, \"accidents happen<br />\nto others, the average driver mistakenly<br />\nreasons, and safety measures can hardly<br />\nbe too strict for his fellow motorists.\"<br /><br />\nTickets Instead<br />\nOf Investigations<br />\nThe research gap is a much greater<br />\nhindrance to intelligent highway safety<br />\nreforms, and is eitused in part by fear<br />\nof the Problem of the Voter-Driver. A<br />\nsearch gap exists between the application of non-automotive-based research<br />\ntechniques to non-automotive research<br />\ngoals and their application to auto safety research, between the development of<br />\nsensible hypotheses and the conduct of<br />\nresearch, between the availability of<br />\nfindings and their legal implementation,<br />\nand between the investigation of accidents and the development of any<br />\nreasoned corrective action. The greatest<br />\ndeficiency is probably the latter. Accidents are rarely investigated in any<br />\ndepth because of the problem of clearing the roadway and removing the injured. The easiest way out of a thorough<br />\ninvestigation for the usually undermanned police agencies is to write a ticket.<br />\n\"The interests of safety are served by<br />\nIssuing the ticket and the case is closed,\"<br />\naccording to Jeffrey O'Connell and<br />\nArthur Myers. Police agencies rarely ask<br />\nthat all-important \"How?\" The bases,<br />\nfurthermore, for most of these tickets<br />\nare unreasonable, unjust, or downright<br />\narbitrary. Traffic laws, the authors say,<br />\nare still based on a hodgepodge of supposition and inference derived from assumptions we have never verified or<br />\neven seriously tried to verify. These suppositions are the last superstitions to<br />\nmake a stand among \"rational\" men.<br />\n\"Thus we satisfy the primitive need<br />\nwhen anything unpleasant happens to<br />\nidentify and punish the guilty person.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, the fatality and injury rates<br />\ngo unabated. These agencies have failed<br />\nthe people they are charged to protect.<br />\nShortage of manpower is one reason,<br />\nbut unqualified personnel is a bigger<br />\none.<br />\nDaniel P. Moynihan in the Journal of<br />\nCriminal Law, said that one of the first<br />\nthings these in-the-field agencies must<br />\ndo is determine just exactly how many<br />\nautomobile accidents there are. No one<br />\nknows at present. The National Safety<br />\nCouncil estimated that there were<br />\n11,500,000 motor vehicle accidents in<br />\n1963, but figures compiled by the Bureau<br />\nof Public Roads in Illinois would indicate that nationwide, there were nearly<br />\n40,000,000. Mr. Moynihan wants a serious<br />\neffort to be made to calibrate injuries<br />\nand catalogue severity so that research<br />\ncan be benefited.<br />\nMany people place great faith in the<br />\ndeath rate per million vehicle miles as<br />\nan accurate measure of fatalities and<br />\nfind great hope in the fact that it is<br />\nclaimed to have been dropping. Moynihan disputes these assertions as well.<br />\nThey are based, he says, on the only two<br />\nreliable figures the State controls\u2014the<br />\nnumber of deaths as measured by how<br />\nmany times the coroner had to go<br />\nexamine a cadaver, and the revenues<br />\nfrom the tax upon the sale of gasoline.<br />\nBut their use to compute deaths per million vehicle miles includes one variable<br />\n\u2014average gasoline consumption. Moyni-<br /><br />\nhan argues that modern traffic patterns;<br />\nfaster freeways, and slower traffic jams,<br />\nplus larger engines, have made the<br />\nformula invalid.<br />\nOnce accidents have been accurately<br />\ncounted, and only then, can some intelligent effort be made to determine<br />\nreal causes and some facts about the<br />\nmost frequent victims. Only then should<br />\nefforts be made to change driving habits<br />\nand traic situations otherwise satisfactory through legislation. Even then, only<br />\na more comprehensive inquiry into driving habits can lead to enlightened and<br />\nwise assignment of responsibility and<br />\nprosecution of violators.<br />\nIn the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Professor Ross A. McFarland of the Division of Environmental Health Science of the Harvard<br />\nSchool of Public Health pointed out<br />\nthat the techniques employed in reducing industrial accidents have been<br />\nknown for years. Hazards are identified<br />\nand mechanical protection installed. In<br />\n\"Unsafe At Any Speed\" Mr. Nader<br />\ncharges the auto companies with not<br />\neven applying what they learned in<br />\nmaking their plants ultra-safe to the<br />\nautomobiles they make and sell. What<br />\nbothers them in the production department evidently does not bother them<br />\nIn the design department.

The Public Utility Transport<br />\nCorporation of the Union of South Africa, a nationwide bus company, devised<br />\na test in which it has confidence, and<br />\nadministers it to all its drivers. According to the company, the results can not<br />\nonly predict which drivers can do the<br />\ncomplex job of driving well day-in-andday-out but which one will.

The<br />\nstate or authority would have the leeway to make standards more less stringent depending on subsequent experience on the highways.<br />\nThe reliability of such tests has come<br />\nunder question and the determination<br />\nof who would decide who should \"pass\"<br />\nand who should \"fail\" is as ticklish as<br />\nthe use of the test itself. But even<br />\nthe start that would be made by eliminating those drivers who are clearly<br />\nabeieated might have a surprisingly<br />\nbeneficial effect on highway accident<br />\netatistios.<br />\nThe education of young potentisd<br />\ndrivers and the continuing education of<br />\nolder drivers has long been irrationally<br />\nthought to have kept our highway secadent rate lawn to the level it is.

Low cost is<br />\nconsidered one of its strong points, although it relies less on auto-industry<br />\neupport, and more on purchased material available through the AAA. The<br />\nbest of these has been the basic simulator developed by the Association.

The only prior effort to determine this involved a complex device<br />\nconected to a spring loaded wire between two cars. It required two drivers<br />\nand had to be used on public roads for<br />\nthe results to be valid. The RCA simulator enables technicians to create any<br />\nkind of highway situation from simple<br />\nto complex, from high-speed to urban,<br />\nfrom night to day, from single-car to<br />\nmulti-car, and froin routine to unimaginably unique.

New York state, acting on this<br />\nMaim, recently lowered Its evidence<br />\nrequirements for intoxioation to .10, and<br />\nestablished a lesser offense of \"impaired<br />\ndriving\" which can be proven by a .05<br />\n10 .10 count, For a 160-pound driver,<br />\nbetween two and three good-sized drinks<br />\nWill produce a count of .05; between<br />\nfour and five, a count of .10; and between six and seven, a count of .16.<br />\nWherever an implied consent law is<br />\nenacted, the standards for conviction<br />\nShould be realistic in order for justice<br />\nio be done both for the majority at<br />\nthe drivers and the alcoholic driver.<br />\nDuring 1962, in Dade County, 44 per<br />\noent of the innocent non-drinking<br />\ndrivers who were killedt In accidents<br /><br />\nwere killed by drivers who had been<br />\ndrinking and were clearly at fault. This<br />\nhas social implications which clearly<br />\nextend beyond the drinker. The teetotaler is threatened by the drinking<br />\ndriver. Whereas the implied consent<br />\nlaws and the realistic standards of<br />\nintoxication are deterrent laws, and are<br />\ndesigned to get the drunk off the road<br />\nwhen caught, a greater social service<br />\ncan be performed by never letting him<br />\nout on It. It is this which the so-called<br />\n\"dram shop act\" attempts to do.<br />\nEssentially, the bartender or saloonkeeper is made his brother's keeper.<br />\nWhile deterrence is not effective<br />\nagainst a drunkard or dope addict, the<br />\ndram shop act aims at a business and<br />\nthere is reason to believe that businesses<br />\nare more effectively deterred because<br />\nthey are more \"rational;\" they wish<br />\nonly to make money and do not have<br />\noverriding emotional disturbances. The<br />\nAmerican Trial Lawyers' Association,<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 6, 1966<br /><br />\ncarry with it a bonus for the richer and<br />\n\"advantaged\" motorist.<br />\nPeriodic re-examination of drivers by<br />\nlicensing authorities will detect changing emotional and physical conditions<br />\nIn drivers if the tests are of any quality.<br />\nThis is the intelligent approach to the<br />\nproblem of the drive according to the<br />\nMaryland Insurance Traffic Safety<br />\nCommittee, and their proposal calling<br />\nfor periodic re-examination should be<br />\nexpanded to include psychological examinations and adopted. If licensing<br />\nis made Federally controlled as has been<br />\nsuggested, most experts are certain that<br />\na periodic physical examination will be<br />\neffected. They, too, a finger on each<br />\ndriver's psychological pulse would be<br />\nthe only way to prevent the effort from<br />\nbeing half-hearted, and therefore unsuccessful, though more costly.<br />\nThat would take care of slowly-developing and easily detectable long-term<br />\nimpairments.

O'Connell and<br />\nMyers, the real problem lies in correcting the underlying emotional defect<br />\nthat makes of a man an alcoholic.<br />\nSome researchers have found that<br />\nmany non-drinking drivers who have<br />\nserious accidents have them according<br />\nto a schedule that approximates the<br />\nfrequency experienced by alcoholics. A<br />\nfurther examination revealed that the<br />\ncauses of the non-drinker's emotional<br />\nupset which led to the accidents were<br />\nstrikingly similar to the causes of<br />\nalcoholism in the alcoholics. Most<br />\ncommon were marital conflict and<br />\nfinancial worry.<br />\nAccidents, according to yet another<br />\nresearcher, breed accidenta. Research<br />\nthat was originally conducted on airplane pilots by D. A. Horn has been<br />\nrecently applied to drivers by Morris<br />\nS. Sohulinger. After the first accident,<br />\nthe chances are extremely high for 30<br />\ndays that the driver will be a second.<br />\nThen the chances drop to below average<br />\nthat the driver will have a second until<br />\nhe does. After it, for about 30 days,<br />\nchances are astronomically high that<br />\nhe will be involved in a third accident,<br />\nand so forth.<br />\nIn recently extending its services to<br />\nmigrant workers who drive around the<br />\ncountry in search of work, the National<br />\nTravelers Aid Association said the<br />\n\"material problems at hunger, joblessness, and homeleasnees\" are a serious<br />\nsafety hasard and the broken-down<br />\njalopy of a worker diverts highway<br />\npatrolmen from other critical duties.<br />\nJust as the elimination of alcoholism,<br />\nand deep-seated emotional disturbances,<br />\nwould make our highways eater, X<br />\nshould be dear that the ultimate, hopefully rapid and certainly inevitable ellinitiation of poverty in America will<br /><br />\nporary impairment such as intorication,<br />\nextreme depression, or just plain inattention. Columbia. University has developed an electronic device which<br />\nwarns the driver if his co-ordination<br />\nfells below a predetermined level. If he<br />\ncontinues to operate the car, and does<br />\nnot improve, the device shuts off the<br />\npower to the engine. Dr. Malfetti says<br />\n\"there is no moraliing; control is seized<br />\nwhen he is demonstrably deficient.\" If<br />\nthe driver is merely being inattentive,<br />\nreaching into the glove compartment or<br />\nsmacking a child in the back seat, then<br />\nthe warning will suffice. Voluntariness<br />\nin driver participation in safe practices<br />\nhas never worked satisfactorially. Just<br />\nas seat-belts, which must be actively<br />\nused, are lees comprehensive than the<br />\nMartin air-bag restraint system, which<br />\nworks automatioally when needed, the<br />\nColumbia device can Lake up where the<br />\ndram shop act, the implied consent law,<br />\nand plain social responsibility and maturity break down.<br />\nThere can be no question but that<br />\nthe universal installation of such a device would oompletely alter the social<br />\nhabits of Americans as much as the<br />\nrigid and severe drunk driving laws in<br />\nScandinavia have changed those people's party-going and bar-hopping<br />\nhabits in ten years. It would be hoped<br />\nthe much talked-of mass public transport; systems can be efficient when such<br />\ndevices are installed in passenger oars.<br />\nJust as the automobile represents<br />\nfreedom for the teenager or independence for the elderly driver, for the<br />\naverage driver, it represents anonymity<br />\nIn a society which does not normally<br />\nlet him make a move without recording<br />\nand reporting fame aspect of his actions. According to the overall findings<br />\nof the Columbia project, this anonymity<br />\nmay be the main reason why the repeated admonitione to drive safely and<br />\n\"be II responsible citizen\" have little<br />\neffect. One answer has been suggestedc<br />\nuse name-bearing license-plates. But in<br />\nan area where large numbers of people<br />\nuse crowded arterial highways and<br /><br />\nbeltways, this is no solution. Furthermore, it is probably of less importance<br />\nto police and other drivers to know<br />\nthat the owner of a car is John Jones<br />\nthan to know that the driver Is an<br />\nelderly driver, a convicted violator, an<br />\ninexperienced student, or a teenager.<br />\nPoor driving, when eliminated. the<br />\nColumbia researchers concluded, will<br />\nnot automatically leave good driving.<br />\nThis is one of the reasons that the<br />\npunative approach has not worked. The<br />\nColumbia group has concluded that in<br />\nlearning anything, including responsible<br />\ndriving habits, punishment is less effective than reward. Punishment merely<br />\ntends to suppress rather than eliminate<br />\nexisting bad habits. The effects of punishment are not so long remembered as<br />\nwas thought in the little red schoolhouse days. The scare campaign of the<br />\nNational Safety Council offered no reward in proper behavior considered by<br />\nthe holiday driver of any consequence<br />\nto him. Threat of death 16 not a punishment anyway, because no one has<br />\nexperienced death and been in a position to learn anything from it.<br />\nFairfax<br />\nCounty. Virginia, broke<br />\nground along the lines Columbia said<br />\nmight be effective. There, students who<br />\ndo well in driver training get a bumper<br />\nsticker labelling their car as \"date-approved.\" The stickers are avidly sought<br />\nafter. This could be easily expanded on<br />\na Statewide or nationwide basis into a<br />\nGraded Permit Plaque System. It would<br />\nbe a combination of two isolated and<br />\nspecialized systems already in use; the<br />\nSports Car Club of America graded<br />\ndriver's permit system, and the Army's<br />\nstaff car rank identification plaques.<br />\nDrivers would be issued licenses that<br />\nwere probationary at first. At each periodic re-examination, the driver could be<br />\nre-evaluated upwards through a series<br />\nof increasingly prestigious licensing<br />\ncategories, or downward if ability or<br />\ntraffic record indicated the advisability<br />\nof that. Each category would have driving privileges over and above the categories below it. For example, the elderly<br />\ndriver would not be allowed to drive<br />\nover 50 miles art hour, or on superhighways that were designated closed to<br />\nthem, or after dark except in emergencies. The plaque would fit a standardized bracket on every car. No car could<br />\nbe operated without a plaque. The<br />\nplaques would represent the driver, not<br />\nthe car, as do license plates.<br /><br />\nPremium Placed<br />\nOn Courtesy<br />\nEach plaque would be distinctive in<br />\ndesign, and the most prestigious would<br />\nbe issued in reasonably limited numbers<br />\nonly to drivers with impeccable reoords,<br />\ncould, for example, be a checioered<br />\nflag. It would have no privileges over<br />\nthe \"expert\" or \"experienced\" driver's<br />\nplaque, but would place a premium of<br />\ncourtesy and safety, for it could be recalled by the issuing authority on the<br />\nmere receipt of a complaint, pending hivestigation. Plaques would be serially<br />\nnumbered with the driver's permit, and<br />\nsevere penalties for transferring or<br />\nstealing them would be imposed.<br />\nbalanced<br />\nA<br />\napproach,<br />\nnot<br />\na<br />\none-sided attack on the role of the vehicle, or a costly effort to improve the<br />\nroads to the neglect of the driver, is<br />\nwhat is needed. New laws and inevitable<br />\nFederal supervision will dramatically<br />\nalter the appearance and safety of the<br />\nAmerican automobile within the next<br />\nthree or four years. With highway building, new techniques have always been<br />\nput into practice as soon as possible<br />\nafter their discovery, and the recent<br />\nroad-building boom has sped that revolution.
