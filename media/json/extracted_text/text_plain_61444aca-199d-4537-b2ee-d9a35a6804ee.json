Pledges are<br />\ncozily nested in their respective classes, and we now can<br />\nview those six strenuous weeks in retrospect.<br />\nThis year's 'rush' was madder than any hatter and<br />\nas cutthroat as a Machiavellian state. It is evident that<br />\nthe great amount of dirt which fraternities slung at one<br />\nanother, that the flagrant violations of the rush rules and<br />\nof the \"spirit\" of clean rushing were due to a fault in the<br />\nIFB's rush rule clause which governs blacklisting.<br />\nArticle 5, section 2 of the rushing rules states,<br />\n\"(Freshmen's) participation in a violation, shall, at the<br />\ndiscretion of the Board, result in their blacklisting for one<br />\nyear.\" \"Blacklisting,\" as defined, means that the freshman shall be allowed to join no fraternity for one year.<br />\nThe rigidity of the clause has defeated its own purpose. To state a hypothetical case, fraternities 'A' and<br />\n'IV both desire to pledge the same freshman, and 'A'<br />\nCommits a violation. 'B' will not submit the violation<br />\nto the Inter-fraternity Board, as a conviction will blacklist<br />\nthat freshman from fraternity 'B,' as well as from 'A.'<br />\nConsequently fraternity 'B' resorts to the tactics of `A';<br />\nthe result is a period of mutual mud slinging.<br />\nThe solution is simple. The blacklisting clause should<br />\nbe altered to read that participation in a violation shall<br />\nresult in \"their blacklisting for one year from the violating<br />\nfraternity.\" As it would limit that fraternity's competition, blacklist solely upon the guilty party would encourage one fraternity to turn in a violation.<br />\nIf such a clause does not put the cork on rushing<br />\nviolations, nothing will.<br />\n<br />\nSpinning Wheels<br />\nIn the closed community of Hopkins, we have an opportunity to practice democracy under almost ideal conditions.<br />\nBut it has struck us that three of the most important<br />\nand influential governing bodies are operating very inefficiently. We are referring to the Student Council, the<br />\nInterfraternity Board and the Dormitory Students Representative Council.<br />\nThe first impression we receive while watching these<br />\nbodies in action is that most of the time they are only<br />\nspinning their wheels. Many words are spent, much time<br />\nis consumed, but little is accomplished. Democracy may<br />\nrequire more discussion to solve a problem than other<br />\nforms of government, and with this we have no quarrel.<br />\nBut much of the talk to which we refer is needless discussion, repetition of the same point not even disguised<br />\nin different words.<br />\nWe suggest that the meetings will run much smoother<br />\nif the chairmen of each of these groups will read Robert's<br />\nRules of Order and abide by them. Experience has shown<br />\nthat a meeting cannot run smoothly, and thus democracy<br />\nis suppressed, by the chair dominating discussion.<br />\nWe further suggest that more use be made of existing<br />\ncommittees. Not enough work is done in committees, and<br />\nwhen it is done, the report is hashed over to the extent<br />\nthat the committee's work is all redone.<br />\nIf these suggestions are carried out, we feel that<br />\nthese three bodies may be able to fulfill their jobs as<br />\nstudent governing bodies. More complete and intelligent<br />\npertinent discussion can take place which will lead to<br />\n.better decisions. Democracy can function and these organizations can make Hopkins student life richer by providing guidance.<br />\n<br />\nRosenberg<br />\n<br />\nOF MICE AND MEN<br />\nRussia may be ahead of the<br />\nUnited States in such things<br />\nas satellites and missiles, but<br />\nwe've got them beat when it<br />\ncomes to psychology, or at least<br />\nHopkins has. As every student<br />\nof introductory psychology soon<br />\ndiscovers, Hopkins psychologists<br />\nare constantly carrying<br />\non<br />\nexperiments\u2014making rats run<br />\nthrough mazes, putting cockroaches on treadmills, and giving<br />\nall the subjects of these experiments generous electric shocks.<br />\nAnd when our, local \"headshrinkers\" get tired of playing<br />\nwith animals (or when they've<br />\nelectrocuted them all), they<br />\nstart in on human beings\u2014<br />\nespecially students. Or perhaps,<br />\nas one student suggested, they<br />\nconsider Hopkins students as<br />\njust another division of the<br />\nAnimal Kingdom.<br />\nWhen I received notice to<br />\nreport for my first psychology<br />\nexperiment, I was therefore<br />\nslightly wary. Would I be forced<br />\nto open various doors to get a<br />\npellet of food, receiving a charge<br />\nof high voltage whenever I<br />\nchose the wrong door? Would<br />\nI have to run through a maze<br />\non a floor that was electrically<br />\ncharged? Would my stomach be<br />\nremoved and replaced with a<br />\nmetal tube to measure the<br />\namount of water I drink?<br />\n<br />\nminutes. Who cared about correlations between art and sex?<br />\nArt is art and sex is sex, and<br />\nI definitely preferred to enjoy<br />\nthe charms of the latter. Put<br />\nthem in order? How could you<br />\ndecide between Gina Lollobrigida and Sophia Loren, for instance? I liked them all! With<br />\na little prodding, however, I<br />\nset to work and finished the<br />\nexperiment. It may have been<br />\ndifficult to decide on the order<br />\nthose charming young women<br />\nrated, but it was one of the<br />\nmost pleasant hours I ever<br />\npassed.<br />\nAssigned to my next experiment a week later, I was of<br />\ncourse delighted and in a hurry<br />\nto get there. Perhaps this time<br />\nI would have to rate live women,<br />\nI thought. But it turned out to<br />\nbe a very dull experiment indeed. A psychologist presented<br />\na series of cards depicting<br />\nshapes and forms, and several<br />\nother subjects and I was called<br />\nupon to write down what each<br />\nof these forms reminded us of.<br />\nI'm afraid I wasn't of much help,<br />\nsince the words \"shape\" and<br />\n\"form\" only served to remind<br />\nme of the former week's very<br />\n<br />\nexciting session and the voluptuous objects with which it \u2022 had<br />\ndealt.<br />\nThe Nudes Again?<br />\nNext came an experiment<br />\ndevised to rate college students<br />\non their degree of masculinity<br />\nand/or femininity, as the case<br />\nmay happen to be. Again I was<br />\nhopeful. Maybe we would be<br />\nshown the ten photographs again<br />\nand have our<br />\nheartbeat and<br />\nblood pressure measured as we<br />\nviewed them. It seemed as logical<br />\n\u2014and enjoyable\u2014a means of<br />\nmeasurement as any I could<br />\nimage. But all we had to do,<br />\nunfortunately, was answer a<br />\nlong questionnaire which would<br />\nthen be graded to determine how<br />\nwell we college students are<br />\ncarrying out the role nature<br />\ngave us to play. I was beginning<br />\nto wonder whether these 'psychologists might have one-track<br />\nminds and might perhaps need<br />\nsome analyzing themselves.<br />\nBut the following experiments<br />\nwere very dully well-rounded<br />\nand healthy. I was asked to rate<br />\nNarious cartoons on the degree<br />\nof their humor, and since there<br />\nwere no examples taken from<br />\n(Continued on Page 8)<br />\n<br />\nPleasant Surprise<br />\nI walked shakily into the chamber set aside for my experiment,<br />\nafraid to sit down lest the chair<br />\nbe electrically charged, fearful<br />\nthat my every move was being<br />\nwatched through a hole in the<br />\nwall.

Virginia went steady<br />\nwith a young man on campus named, oddly enough,<br />\nOddly Enough who was supple and fair and lithe and animated and majoring in phys ed.<br />\nVirginia and Oddly enjoyed a romance that was as<br />\nidyllic as a summer day, as placid as a millpond. Never<br />\ndid they fight\u2014never, never, never l\u2014because Virginia,<br />\nwho was majoring in psychology, did not believe in fighting. \"Fighting,\" she often said, \"settles nothing.

Now that things are progressing well with them<br />\nthis year, chances look good for their getting adequate<br />\nequipment, including tennis balls.<br />\nScheduling for wrestling for the 1958-1959 season<br />\ntakes place next month, and Athletic Director Marshall<br />\nTurner has stated that he does not plan to schedule any<br />\nmeets for Hopkins.<br />\nTurner bases this decision on past experience with<br />\nwrestling at Hopkins. Last year the members of the<br />\nvarsity grappling squad numbered almost half of the<br />\noriginal turnout in the fall when the sport was dropped<br />\nfrom the Jays' intercollegiate program.<br />\nOf the thirty-five or forty that showed up at the organizational meeting of the team, Turner expects at least<br />\nthree or four to be absent when practice begins Tuesday,<br />\nDecember 3.<br />\nHe expects the squad's ranks to be depleted following<br />\nthe Christmas vacation and again after mid-year finals.<br />\nAfter these three 'days of decision,' the size of the<br />\nroster generally remains constant.<br />\nSince he has had to cancel this year's and last year's<br />\nschedules, Turner does-not want to have to do the same<br />\nthing again.<br />\nA large squad at the end of this season and a big<br />\nturnout next fall would justify his scheduling meets for<br />\nthe 1959-1960 season believes Turner.<br />\nHowever, if this is not the case, the best the wrestlers<br />\ncan hope for is a possible schedule for this year's freshmen's senior year.<br />\nSince the wrestling program has been hampered by<br />\na general lack of enthusiasm in the past, Turner cannot<br />\nbe given full blame for the current situation.<br />\nVery few schools will risk scheduling a meet with<br />\nHopkins, if the Jays cancel three out of four. Also if<br />\nHopkins does not schedule any meets for a number of<br />\nyears, the chances of getting former opponents to again<br />\nschedule them will be slim, as the schools will probably<br />\nhave any open dates filled by then.<br />\nThe situation is quite involved, and the only solution<br />\nappears to be the wrestlers' showing that they are justified<br />\nin asking for wrestling's 'reincarnation' by giving the<br />\nsport the necessary support.<br />\n<br />\n\"It was our best win of the<br />\nseason,\" said freshman mentor<br />\nBob Scott, \"played under very<br />\ntrying weather conditions\".<br />\n\"Our defensive line was outstanding and our goal line<br />\nstand in the last few minutes of<br />\nthe game was indicitive of the<br />\ntype of line play we have had<br />\nall year long,\" he continued.<br />\nIn the last few minutes of the<br />\ngame, a thirty yard penalty gave<br />\nWestern Maryland the ball on<br />\nthe Hopkins four yard line.<br />\nAfter four plays, they had gained<br />\nonly three yards, and before<br />\nHopkins got the chance to put<br />\nthe ball back into play, time<br />\nran out.<br />\n<br />\nare, on the line, at tackle, Al<br />\nFreeland, Jim Kelly and Tom<br />\nBiddison, and at guard, Larry<br />\nCessna, Mike Hopkins and John<br />\nMigliore.

Pledges are<br />\ncozily nested in their respective classes, and we now can<br />\nview those six strenuous weeks in retrospect.<br />\nThis year's 'rush' was madder than any hatter and<br />\nas cutthroat as a Machiavellian state. It is evident that<br />\nthe great amount of dirt which fraternities slung at one<br />\nanother, that the flagrant violations of the rush rules and<br />\nof the \"spirit\" of clean rushing were due to a fault in the<br />\nIFB's rush rule clause which governs blacklisting.<br />\nArticle 5, section 2 of the rushing rules states,<br />\n\"(Freshmen's) participation in a violation, shall, at the<br />\ndiscretion of the Board, result in their blacklisting for one<br />\nyear.\" \"Blacklisting,\" as defined, means that the freshman shall be allowed to join no fraternity for one year.<br />\nThe rigidity of the clause has defeated its own purpose. To state a hypothetical case, fraternities 'A' and<br />\n'IV both desire to pledge the same freshman, and 'A'<br />\nCommits a violation. 'B' will not submit the violation<br />\nto the Inter-fraternity Board, as a conviction will blacklist<br />\nthat freshman from fraternity 'B,' as well as from 'A.'<br />\nConsequently fraternity 'B' resorts to the tactics of `A';<br />\nthe result is a period of mutual mud slinging.<br />\nThe solution is simple. The blacklisting clause should<br />\nbe altered to read that participation in a violation shall<br />\nresult in \"their blacklisting for one year from the violating<br />\nfraternity.\" As it would limit that fraternity's competition, blacklist solely upon the guilty party would encourage one fraternity to turn in a violation.<br />\nIf such a clause does not put the cork on rushing<br />\nviolations, nothing will.<br /><br />\nSpinning Wheels<br />\nIn the closed community of Hopkins, we have an opportunity to practice democracy under almost ideal conditions.<br />\nBut it has struck us that three of the most important<br />\nand influential governing bodies are operating very inefficiently. We are referring to the Student Council, the<br />\nInterfraternity Board and the Dormitory Students Representative Council.<br />\nThe first impression we receive while watching these<br />\nbodies in action is that most of the time they are only<br />\nspinning their wheels. Many words are spent, much time<br />\nis consumed, but little is accomplished. Democracy may<br />\nrequire more discussion to solve a problem than other<br />\nforms of government, and with this we have no quarrel.<br />\nBut much of the talk to which we refer is needless discussion, repetition of the same point not even disguised<br />\nin different words.<br />\nWe suggest that the meetings will run much smoother<br />\nif the chairmen of each of these groups will read Robert's<br />\nRules of Order and abide by them. Experience has shown<br />\nthat a meeting cannot run smoothly, and thus democracy<br />\nis suppressed, by the chair dominating discussion.<br />\nWe further suggest that more use be made of existing<br />\ncommittees. Not enough work is done in committees, and<br />\nwhen it is done, the report is hashed over to the extent<br />\nthat the committee's work is all redone.<br />\nIf these suggestions are carried out, we feel that<br />\nthese three bodies may be able to fulfill their jobs as<br />\nstudent governing bodies. More complete and intelligent<br />\npertinent discussion can take place which will lead to<br />\n.better decisions. Democracy can function and these organizations can make Hopkins student life richer by providing guidance.<br /><br />\nRosenberg<br /><br />\nOF MICE AND MEN<br />\nRussia may be ahead of the<br />\nUnited States in such things<br />\nas satellites and missiles, but<br />\nwe've got them beat when it<br />\ncomes to psychology, or at least<br />\nHopkins has. As every student<br />\nof introductory psychology soon<br />\ndiscovers, Hopkins psychologists<br />\nare constantly carrying<br />\non<br />\nexperiments\u2014making rats run<br />\nthrough mazes, putting cockroaches on treadmills, and giving<br />\nall the subjects of these experiments generous electric shocks.<br />\nAnd when our, local \"headshrinkers\" get tired of playing<br />\nwith animals (or when they've<br />\nelectrocuted them all), they<br />\nstart in on human beings\u2014<br />\nespecially students. Or perhaps,<br />\nas one student suggested, they<br />\nconsider Hopkins students as<br />\njust another division of the<br />\nAnimal Kingdom.<br />\nWhen I received notice to<br />\nreport for my first psychology<br />\nexperiment, I was therefore<br />\nslightly wary. Would I be forced<br />\nto open various doors to get a<br />\npellet of food, receiving a charge<br />\nof high voltage whenever I<br />\nchose the wrong door? Would<br />\nI have to run through a maze<br />\non a floor that was electrically<br />\ncharged?

Who cared about correlations between art and sex?<br />\nArt is art and sex is sex, and<br />\nI definitely preferred to enjoy<br />\nthe charms of the latter. Put<br />\nthem in order? How could you<br />\ndecide between Gina Lollobrigida and Sophia Loren, for instance? I liked them all! With<br />\na little prodding, however, I<br />\nset to work and finished the<br />\nexperiment. It may have been<br />\ndifficult to decide on the order<br />\nthose charming young women<br />\nrated, but it was one of the<br />\nmost pleasant hours I ever<br />\npassed.<br />\nAssigned to my next experiment a week later, I was of<br />\ncourse delighted and in a hurry<br />\nto get there. Perhaps this time<br />\nI would have to rate live women,<br />\nI thought. But it turned out to<br />\nbe a very dull experiment indeed. A psychologist presented<br />\na series of cards depicting<br />\nshapes and forms, and several<br />\nother subjects and I was called<br />\nupon to write down what each<br />\nof these forms reminded us of.<br />\nI'm afraid I wasn't of much help,<br />\nsince the words \"shape\" and<br />\n\"form\" only served to remind<br />\nme of the former week's very<br /><br />\nexciting session and the voluptuous objects with which it \u2022 had<br />\ndealt.<br />\nThe Nudes Again?<br />\nNext came an experiment<br />\ndevised to rate college students<br />\non their degree of masculinity<br />\nand/or femininity, as the case<br />\nmay happen to be.

But all we had to do,<br />\nunfortunately, was answer a<br />\nlong questionnaire which would<br />\nthen be graded to determine how<br />\nwell we college students are<br />\ncarrying out the role nature<br />\ngave us to play. I was beginning<br />\nto wonder whether these 'psychologists might have one-track<br />\nminds and might perhaps need<br />\nsome analyzing themselves.<br />\nBut the following experiments<br />\nwere very dully well-rounded<br />\nand healthy.

Virginia went steady<br />\nwith a young man on campus named, oddly enough,<br />\nOddly Enough who was supple and fair and lithe and animated and majoring in phys ed.<br />\nVirginia and Oddly enjoyed a romance that was as<br />\nidyllic as a summer day, as placid as a millpond. Never<br />\ndid they fight\u2014never, never, never l\u2014because Virginia,<br />\nwho was majoring in psychology, did not believe in fighting. \"Fighting,\" she often said, \"settles nothing. The scientific way is to look calmly for the cause of the friction.\"<br />\nSo whenever she and Oddly were on the verge of a<br />\nquarrel,she used to whip out a series of ink blot tests and<br />\nthey would discover the true underlying cause of their<br />\ndispute and deal with it in an enlightened, dispassionate<br />\nmanner. Then,the irritant removed, their romance would<br />\nresume its tranquil, serene, unruffled course.<br />\nAfter six months of this sedate liaison, Oddly was so<br />\nbored he could spit. He loved Virginia well enough, but<br />\nhe also believed that people in love ought to fight now<br />\nand then.\"It opens the pores,\" he said.\"And besides, it's<br />\nso much fun making up afterwards.\"<br />\nBut Virginia would not be provoked into a quarrel.<br />\nOne night Oddly tried very hard. \"Hey,\" he said to her,<br />\n\"your hair looks like a bat's nest and your ears look like<br />\nlast year's turnips and your face looks like a pan of worms<br />\nand as for your head, l've seen better heads on newel<br />\nposts.\"<br />\n\"My goodness, we're. hostile tonight!\" said Virginia<br />\ncheerfully and whipped 120 Rorschach cards out of her<br />\nreticule. \"Come,\" she said, \"let us examine your psychic<br />\napparatus.\"<br /><br />\nyap adt5-geMeke G\"ed.71<br />\nOddly tried again. \"Who makes your clothes?\" he<br />\nsneered. \"Bethlehem Steel?\"<br />\n\"I-Imm,\" said Virginia thought fully and lit a cigarette .<br />\n\"This sounds like an anxiety neurosis with totemism,<br />\nanagogic trauma, and a belt in the back.\"<br />\n\"I hate you,\" Said Oddly.\"I hate your looks and your<br />\nclothes and your toenails and your relatives and the<br />\ncigarettes you smoke.\"<br />\n\"Now,hold on, buster!\" cried Virginia, her eyes crackling, her color mounting, her nostrils dame.\"Just keep a<br />\ncivil tongue in your stupid head when you talk about<br />\nMarlboro!

In 1957, Du Pont's sales<br />\nwere at the $2 billion level. Four new<br />\nplants were being built.

Now that things are progressing well with them<br />\nthis year, chances look good for their getting adequate<br />\nequipment, including tennis balls.<br />\nScheduling for wrestling for the 1958-1959 season<br />\ntakes place next month, and Athletic Director Marshall<br />\nTurner has stated that he does not plan to schedule any<br />\nmeets for Hopkins.<br />\nTurner bases this decision on past experience with<br />\nwrestling at Hopkins. Last year the members of the<br />\nvarsity grappling squad numbered almost half of the<br />\noriginal turnout in the fall when the sport was dropped<br />\nfrom the Jays' intercollegiate program.<br />\nOf the thirty-five or forty that showed up at the organizational meeting of the team, Turner expects at least<br />\nthree or four to be absent when practice begins Tuesday,<br />\nDecember 3.<br />\nHe expects the squad's ranks to be depleted following<br />\nthe Christmas vacation and again after mid-year finals.<br />\nAfter these three 'days of decision,' the size of the<br />\nroster generally remains constant.<br />\nSince he has had to cancel this year's and last year's<br />\nschedules, Turner does-not want to have to do the same<br />\nthing again.<br />\nA large squad at the end of this season and a big<br />\nturnout next fall would justify his scheduling meets for<br />\nthe 1959-1960 season believes Turner.<br />\nHowever, if this is not the case, the best the wrestlers<br />\ncan hope for is a possible schedule for this year's freshmen's senior year.<br />\nSince the wrestling program has been hampered by<br />\na general lack of enthusiasm in the past, Turner cannot<br />\nbe given full blame for the current situation.<br />\nVery few schools will risk scheduling a meet with<br />\nHopkins, if the Jays cancel three out of four. Also if<br />\nHopkins does not schedule any meets for a number of<br />\nyears, the chances of getting former opponents to again<br />\nschedule them will be slim, as the schools will probably<br />\nhave any open dates filled by then.<br />\nThe situation is quite involved, and the only solution<br />\nappears to be the wrestlers' showing that they are justified<br />\nin asking for wrestling's 'reincarnation' by giving the<br />\nsport the necessary support.<br /><br />\n\"It was our best win of the<br />\nseason,\" said freshman mentor<br />\nBob Scott, \"played under very<br />\ntrying weather conditions\".<br />\n\"Our defensive line was outstanding and our goal line<br />\nstand in the last few minutes of<br />\nthe game was indicitive of the<br />\ntype of line play we have had<br />\nall year long,\" he continued.<br />\nIn the last few minutes of the<br />\ngame, a thirty yard penalty gave<br />\nWestern Maryland the ball on<br />\nthe Hopkins four yard line.<br />\nAfter four plays, they had gained<br />\nonly three yards, and before<br />\nHopkins got the chance to put<br />\nthe ball back into play, time<br />\nran out.<br /><br />\nare, on the line, at tackle, Al<br />\nFreeland, Jim Kelly and Tom<br />\nBiddison, and at guard, Larry<br />\nCessna, Mike Hopkins and John<br />\nMigliore.
