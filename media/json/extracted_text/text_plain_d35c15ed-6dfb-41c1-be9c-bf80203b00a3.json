It seems that the<br />\ncoalition of Socialists and<br />\nChristian Democrats which<br />\npresently controls the<br />\ngovernment, will be unable to<br />\nweather another crisis, and<br />\nthe Communists will enter the<br />\ngovernment. Another<br />\n<br />\npossibitity would be a<br />\npreemptive coup by the<br />\nArmed Forces and other<br />\nauthoritarian elements.<br />\nThe course was timely .<br />\nbecause of a growing trend in<br />\nFrance and Italy for- the<br />\nelectorate to register its<br />\ndissatisfaction- with a<br />\ndeteriorating economic and<br />\nsocial situation by voting<br />\nCommunist, whether they are<br />\nMarxist or not. A question<br />\nwhich poses problems for<br />\nAmerican policymakers is<br />\ntheir inability to predict how<br />\nthe Communists will act if<br />\nthey do take part in the<br />\ngoverment. Mr. Kissinger's<br />\nrecently revealed attempt to<br />\nforestall such an occurence by<br />\nsupporting selected political<br />\ngroups, in view of the<br />\nwidespread corruption in the<br />\nItalian government and the<br />\nparalysis of public services,<br />\nseems to be too little too late.<br />\n<br />\nIt was uotorwi,ate that<br />\nthough the course was limited<br />\nto twenty students and there<br />\nwere people who were forced<br />\non to a waiting list, several<br />\nenrolled students failed to<br />\nattend. This discourtesy by<br />\nseveral undergraduates<br />\ndeprived other genuinely<br />\ninterested students from taking<br />\nthe course. Another<br />\nunfortunate reflection on the<br />\nundergraduate student body<br />\nwas the woefully inadequate<br />\npreparation of some students.<br />\nwhich indicated a confusion<br />\nwith both history and<br />\ncontemporary international<br />\nevents, easily rectified by a<br />\nsimple perusal of the<br />\nnewspaper.

He was<br />\nbrilliant, it was thought, but<br />\nInevitably neurotic. He would<br />\n\"burn out\" after a few years,<br />\nand cease being productive.<br />\nThe gifted was thought to be<br />\nsomehow condemned by his<br />\nvery precocity.<br />\nThe following year, in the<br />\nmidst of such prejudice, Dr.<br />\n'Louis Terman, the man<br />\nresponsible for the<br />\nStanford-Binet IQ test, began<br />\na Study of the gifted youth.<br />\n1 .300 youngsters from<br />\nCalifornia, all with a<br />\nminimum IQ of 140, were<br />\nchosen for the study, the<br />\nnature of which was to<br />\nmonitor the progress of these<br />\nindividuals for the 'rest of<br />\ntheir lives. Terman published<br />\nfive volumes of Genetic<br />\nStudies of -Genius The work<br />\noutlived Terman, who died in<br />\n1959. In 1968 a monograph<br />\nwritten by Melita Oden of<br />\nStanford University described<br />\nthe forty year follow-up of<br />\nthe Terman Gifted Group.<br />\nThe study showed a high<br />\ndegree of accomplishment<br />\nand personal satisfaction with<br />\ntheir lives among the gifted. It<br />\nsuccessfully disproved many<br />\nof the assumptions that had<br />\nbeen prevalent at the study's<br />\ninception. The Terman Study,<br />\nhowever, was a passive.<br />\nObservatory approach to the<br />\nmatter. Controversy<br />\n<br />\ncontinued over the subject of<br />\njust how the precocious<br />\nyouth ought to be handled.<br />\nWas educational acceleration<br />\nthe answer? Would it be<br />\nbeneficial to the gifted? If it<br />\nwas, how should it be done?<br />\nUsing Terman's work as a<br />\nbasis, Dr. Julian Stanley of<br />\nthe Hopkins Psych. Dept. has<br />\nfurther researched the gifted.<br />\nOne difference between<br />\nSMPY and Terman is the new<br />\nstudy's emphasis on<br />\nmathematically precocious<br />\nstudents. But the essential<br />\ndifference is that while the<br />\nTerman study was passive,<br />\nSMPY is \"strongly<br />\ninterventional\", in furthering<br />\nthe progress of the gifted<br />\nchild. Dr. Stanley's research<br />\n(SMPY works with many<br />\nacademicians devoted to the<br />\nfield, including Dr. Lynn Fox<br />\nof the Evening College) has<br />\nconvinced him of the benefits<br />\nof properly administered<br />\nacceleration for the gifted.<br />\nCase in Point<br />\nSeven years ago,<br />\ntwelve-year old Joseph Bates<br />\nwas brought to the attention<br />\nof Dr. Stanley. When tested,<br />\nJoseph scored a 590 on a SAT<br />\nverbal test, and 669 on a SAT<br />\nmath test. In eighth grade,<br />\nand without having taken any<br />\ncourses in general science,<br />\nJoseph scored a 752 on a<br />\nPhysics achievement. Yet the<br />\npublic schools refused to<br />\nprovide Joseph with any<br />\naccess to advanced courses,<br />\nand the private schools<br />\noffered no alternatives. Under<br />\nthe guidance of Dr. Stanley,<br />\nJoseph was put into a<br />\nfast-math program in which<br />\nhe was taught 51<br />\n/<br />\n2 years of<br />\nprecalculus mathematics in<br />\n120 hours. He went from<br />\ngrade 6 to 8 to 11 to 14,<br />\nentering Hopkins as a<br />\nsophomore at the age of 14.<br />\nHe graduated at 17 with a BA<br />\nin quantitative studies. Three<br />\nmonths later he had his -'MS'<br />\nHe is currently in his third<br />\n<br />\nyear of a doctoral program at<br />\nCornell. He is 20 years old.<br />\nIn 1972, SIAPY began a<br />\nformalized relationship with<br />\nthe gifted child. Annually, the<br />\ntop 2000 (2%)of seventh and<br />\neighth graders (in terms of<br />\nmathematical ability) are<br />\ntested. Of these, the top 10%<br />\nare determined. Not all of<br />\nthese 200, or even most of<br />\nthem, are rapidly accelerated.<br />\nThe range in SAT scores of<br />\nthose students actively in the<br />\nstudy is M640-M800. Personal<br />\nmotivation of the youth is the<br />\nforemost consideration inn<br />\nany acceleration. No one is<br />\npushed, but those who have<br />\nthe desire are helped to move<br />\nahead.

Ile was<br />\nthe victim of a classic<br />\ngangland execution, one that<br />\nwas suspiciously similar to a<br />\nscene in the most famous film<br />\nof the day, \"The Godfather.\"<br />\nGallo's obituaries depicted<br />\nhim as a mean and hard-nosed<br />\nkiller, a \"maverick mafioso\"<br />\nwho boasted of being picked<br />\nup by the cops 150 times.<br />\nThe newsweeklies told tales<br />\nof Gallo \"puncturing his<br />\nenemies with iee picks just for<br />\nthe hell of it\" and \"gaining<br />\nstatus by serving as a member<br />\nf a five man execution squad<br />\n<br />\ndirtected by mafia boss Joe<br />\nProfaci in the late fifties.<br />\nGallo's was the most difficult<br />\nkind of death for the public<br />\nto react to; no one likes to<br />\nhear of death, particularly<br />\ncold-blooded murder, but in<br />\nGallo's case only an insider<br />\ncould share in his family's<br />\ngrief. In short, public school<br />\nin New York was not closed<br />\nin mourning for Joey Gallo.<br />\nNot even in Little Italy.<br />\nTherefore, it is not<br />\nsurprising that a number of<br />\npeople, especially New<br />\nYorkers, are perplexed by<br />\nBob Dylan's glorification of<br />\nJoey Gallo's crime and<br />\nbullet-ridden life on his latest<br />\nalbum,Desire.<br />\nDylan takes a professed<br />\n\"hard-as-nails\" gangster and<br />\nportrays him as a family man<br />\nwho, as a pawn of chance,<br />\nwas led astray. According to<br />\nDylan, Gallo never carried a<br />\ngun because \"I'm around too<br />\nmany children, they should<br />\nneven know of one.\" He sings<br />\nof Gallo's release from Attica<br />\nprison; \"they let him out in<br />\n'71, he lost a little weight, but<br />\nhe dressed like Jimmy<br />\nCagney, and I swear he did<br />\nlook great.\" To one who is<br />\nnot familiar with Gallo the<br />\nromanticism is just another<br />\nelement of the song, meshed<br />\nwell with Dylan's finest vocal<br />\nand phrasing on the album.<br />\nHowever, for those who grew<br />\nup reading page three stories<br />\nand photo spreads about<br />\nGallo's killings and mob<br />\ndealings in newspapers like<br />\nthe New York Daily News<br />\nand National Enquirer, the<br />\nsong is unsettling at best.<br />\nDylan's intentions remain a<br />\npuzzle. Was he consciously<br />\nattempting to rescue Gallo<br />\n<br />\nfrom the ranks of Mafia<br />\ninfamy or was he taken in by<br />\nthe folksy aura that \"led<br />\nsome of his superficial<br />\nacquantances to consider him<br />\na sort of folk hero\"? It's hard<br />\nto believe that Dylan, a<br />\nresident of New York<br />\nthroughout the sixties, would<br />\nwrite such a naive ballad<br />\nabout a mobster who<br />\ndelighted in breaking arms<br />\nand spitting at subordinates.<br />\nThey didn't call Joey Gallo<br />\ncrazy for nothing.<br />\nIt seems more probable<br />\nthat Gallo's new status as a<br />\nmartyr and folk hero was<br />\ncalculated very carefully by<br />\nDylan. By decriminalizing<br />\nGallo, Dylan has placed Gallo<br />\n<br />\non the pedestal shared by the<br />\nlikes of Jesse James and Billy<br />\nthe Kid, two of the<br />\nsongwriter's favorite models<br />\nin previous work. James and<br />\nBilly the Kid have been<br />\ncloaked in mystique since<br />\ntheir death and as the years<br />\npass their image grows while<br />\ntheir villainous lives are<br />\nforgotten. Of course, it takes<br />\nmore than one song for a<br />\nlegend of this type to catch<br />\non, but it is songs like \"Joey\"<br />\nthat add to a myth and spread<br />\nit.<br />\nThirty years from now,<br />\nafter Gallo's crimes have been<br />\nforgotten, the gangster will<br />\nhave been transformed into<br />\n\"Joey, king of the streets,<br />\n<br />\nchild of clay.\" All that will<br />\nsurvive will be the legend of<br />\nJoey Gallo and Dylan will be<br />\nlost in the years, for a legend<br />\nis bigger than any man.<br />\nThat Dylan uses a<br />\ncontemporary gangster as his<br />\nlatest folk model is an<br />\nexample of his desperate need<br />\nfor changing his music and<br />\nwriting. The main differences '<br />\nin Dylan's writing about Gallo<br />\ninstead of the bandit John<br />\nWesley Hardin is that the<br />\nlatter was already an<br />\nestablished legend before'<br />\nDylan was even born. He just<br />\npaid homage to the myth by<br />\nadding another song. But with<br />\nGallo, the implications of the<br />\nsong are more meaningful.<br />\nbecause by eulogizing Gallo<br />\nhe is creating another myth,<br />\ninstead of simply adding to it.<br />\nIn this sense, Dylan is playing<br />\nwith history and folk culture<br />\nby intentionally whitewashing<br />\na man who was repulsive to<br />\nmost of the society in which<br />\nhe lived.<br />\nBy recognizing this process<br />\nit is easy to imagine that Jesse<br />\nJames and John Wesley<br />\nHardin were every bit as<br />\nnotorious and gun thirsty as<br />\nGallo. Dylan realizes this.<br />\nwhich is why he titles the song<br />\nas anonymous \"Joey\"<br />\ninstead of something more<br />\ndirect like \"The Ballad of<br />\nJoey Gallo.\" That was the<br />\nfirst step in Gallo's<br />\ndecriminalization.<br />\nWhether Dylan's sense of<br />\nmorality and historical<br />\nperspective are out of line is<br />\nsomething that most listeners<br />\nwill not be able to agree on.<br />\nBut, like it or not, there now<br />\nV seems to be one more myth<br />\nto deal with: .the legend of<br />\ncrazy Joe.<br />\n<br />\nDylan's new ip and a mix ofRolling Thunder Sunrise<br />\nBy DAVID HAWK<br />\nAs the reverberations of<br />\nRolling Thunder echoed<br />\ntIi roughout the East Coast.<br />\nwith them went Desire.

By the<br />\nper<br />\nend of 1967. Dylan realized<br />\nthat the trends of the sixties<br />\n<br />\nhad all been put in motion<br />\nand that it was time to look to<br />\nthe seventies. Now, after New<br />\nMorning's (1970) false start,<br />\nhe has produced a polished<br />\nwork of art which has<br />\nsilenced cries for \"the old<br />\nDylan\" and created a furor<br />\nabout the \"new Dylan.\"<br />\nThe title of the album is<br />\nespecially apt. Throughout his<br />\ncareer, the poetic and<br />\nemotional intensity of<br />\nDylan's music has been<br />\neffective enough to cause<br />\nmany to conclude that Dylan<br />\ngave the generation of the<br />\nsixties a voice. Dylan's songs<br />\nsomehow capture the travail<br />\nof a new awareness struggling<br />\nto be born, the groping of a<br />\ndecade. His songs reveal a<br />\nsearch for justice. love, and<br />\nthat which every artist<br />\ndeserves: the opportunity to<br />\nredeem himself. His<br />\nemotional genius enables him<br />\nto search and desire for others<br />\nas well<br />\nKeeping this in mind, it is<br />\nnone the less important to<br />\nnote the basic developments<br />\nwhich have been effected in<br />\n<br />\nDylan's music. On the album,<br />\nJacques Levy co-authored<br />\nseven of the nine songs with<br />\nDylan. Levy's ability to<br />\ncompose and innovate<br />\nmusically have enabled Dylan<br />\nto strengthen his songs of<br />\ndesire. With Levy's guidance,<br />\nDylan is using his voice in<br />\nnew and exciting ways, and<br />\nEmmylou Harris' background<br />\nvocals and Scarlet Rivera's<br />\nelectric violin blend well with<br />\nthe innovations in rhythm.<br />\nthrust, and tone which Levy<br />\nand Dylan have combined to<br />\nproduce.

What makes the state<br />\ngrow out of proportion in<br />\nrelation to political strength,<br />\nis that the winner of the<br />\ncontest receives tremendous<br />\nimmediate coverage from the<br />\nnational press with all the<br />\nbenefits that exposure brings<br />\nwith it (cash, volunteers,<br />\nendorsements).

Dr.<br />\nPfeffer considers a 'C' a good<br />\ngrade and the majority of<br />\ngrades given out were 'good<br />\ngrades'.\"<br />\nIn response, I do not and<br />\nnever have considered a \"C\" a<br />\ngood grade. Personally, I<br />\nconsider it less than<br />\nsatisfactory work, and I tell<br />\nmy students that. Moreover,<br />\nthe last time the course was<br />\noffered, under the title<br />\n<br />\n\"China Today,\" the majority<br />\nof grades were not \"C's,\" as<br />\nthe report seems to imply. To<br />\nbe precise, of the 16 grades<br />\ngiven, 3 Were \"A's,\" 7 were<br />\n\"B's\" and only 3 were \"C's:\"<br />\none was a pass and two were<br />\nincompletes. The only<br />\nsubstance to the charge that<br />\n\"grading is rather strict\" is<br />\nthat I have resisted the total<br />\nsurrender to grade inflation<br />\nreflected at Hopkins today.<br />\nMore importantly, the<br />\nreport charges that my<br />\ngrading is \"even a bit<br />\nprejudicial\"\u2014equivalent to<br />\nthe kiss of death in a<br />\n\"value -free,\" liberal<br />\nuniversity. And further that<br />\nessay exam questions are<br />\n\"vague\" and \"must be<br />\nanswered just right and<br />\nfavorably to China.\" This is a<br />\nmore complex and difficult<br />\ncharge to rebut, involving as it<br />\ndoes different ideologies. Let<br />\nme try to respond.<br />\nFirst, I do not think that<br />\nmy grading is any more<br />\n\"prejudicial\" than any other<br />\nprofessor's in the social<br />\nsciences or humanities. My<br />\nprejudices simply are not<br />\n<br />\nthose widely shared by<br />\nfaculty members and<br />\nstudents, so they are more<br />\nobvious. I do not try to<br />\ndisguise my values.<br />\nNevertheless, I believe I<br />\nrecognize quality work when<br />\nI see it, and I have given<br />\n\"A's\" to well conceived and<br />\nexecuted papers that argued<br />\nMao is a fascist, and<br />\nconversely, I have given \"C's\"<br />\nto poorly written,<br />\nunthoughtful essays that<br />\nsimply parrot \"the line.\" In<br />\nthe final analysis, however, I<br />\nrecognize that one's ideology<br />\ncannot help but influence<br />\nhow one conceives relevance<br />\nand significance. On that<br />\ncount, I would, with the rest<br />\nof humanity, plead guilty.<br />\nSecond, it is true that my<br />\nessay questions are \"vague.\"<br />\nThey are intended to be, so as<br />\nto allow students within a<br />\nwide range to answer them as<br />\nthey think most useful, to<br />\nmake the questions their own.<br />\nThat they must be answered<br />\n\"just right,\" I think is wrong,<br />\nunless by \"right\" is meant<br />\nthat the answer must be<br />\nlogical, well-written,<br />\n<br />\nargumentative, and with some<br />\nreasonable connection to<br />\nhistorical fact and a<br />\nreasonable use of evidence to<br />\nsupport the arguments. One<br />\nrather frequent, half-pained<br />\ncomment I have had to these<br />\nessay questions is that they<br />\n\"forced\" students to think.<br />\nAnother is that they \"forced\"<br />\nstudents to try to learn how<br />\nto discipline their writing. I<br />\nlike to believe that is what I<br />\nam doing.<br />\nThat essays must be<br />\nfavorable to China to be<br />\nconsidered good is, as<br />\nindicated above, clearly<br />\nwiong as a flat statement. But<br />\nthe matter is more complex<br />\nthan .that. My main<br />\nsubstantive goal in the course<br />\nis to try to enable students to<br />\nunderstand the Chinese<br />\nRevolution in its own terms,<br />\nas the Chinese saw it. We<br />\ncannot understand why and<br />\nhow that revolution has<br />\ndeveloped if we pose liberal<br />\nquestions to twentieth<br />\ncentury China, or if we judge<br />\nChina's Revolution by liberal<br />\nstandards. China has never<br />\nbeen, is not no'w, art does<br />\n<br />\nnot wish to become a liberal<br />\nsociety<br />\nI demand is not that<br />\nstudents react \"favorably\" to<br />\nthe Chinese Revolution but<br />\nthat they reach an<br />\nunderstanding of the<br />\nrevolution in its own terms as<br />\na basis for whatever ultimate<br />\nevaluation they may wish to<br />\nmake. To do otherwise, it<br />\nseems to me, entails simply<br />\nabdicating on the crucial<br />\nmatter of understanding a<br />\nsociety so different from and<br />\nso alien to our society, and<br />\nresults in self-satisfying<br />\ncondemnations of China as<br />\nilliberal.<br />\nThese are difficult matters<br />\nto cope with. The line<br />\nbetween understanding and<br />\nsympathy, on one hand, and<br />\napology, on the other, can be<br />\nvery fine. I have tried not to<br />\ncross it, though, doubtless, I<br />\nhave made mistakes. On the<br />\nwhole, however, I am willing<br />\nto stand on what I have done<br />\nand on how students have<br />\nresponded.<br />\nThank you.<br />\nRichard M. Pfeffer<br />\nAssociate Professor<br />\n<br />\n\fClayton Blick<br />\n<br />\nPorno-promo<br />\n<br />\nErica, in spite of it all, you're still coming through<br />\nD. H. WARREN<br />\nThe sky is clearer when I'm<br />\nnot in heat,<br />\n& the poems<br />\nare colder.<br />\nI was recently thumbing<br />\nthrough a friend's dog-eared<br />\ncopy of Fear of Flying and<br />\nbecame rather amused by the<br />\npublishers' claim that the<br />\nbook was the \"wildest, most<br />\nuninhibited sexual<br />\nextravaganza\" ever written.<br />\nSure, go ahead and make your<br />\ncheapest shots to sell sell sell.<br />\nUnderestimate our<br />\nintelligence because that<br />\nusually succeeds. Everybody<br />\nwants to look through a dirty<br />\nbook -- maybe only to put it<br />\ndown, but you still want to<br />\nsee. The alluring unzipping<br />\nfor a cover promised erotic<br />\nfantasy extraordinary -- a<br />\nsure-fire bathroom<br />\ncompanion for all the young<br />\nmen.<br />\nFear of Flying, however, is<br />\nanything but erotic. Jong has<br />\ncalled it, a \"saga of<br />\nunfulfillment.\" Nearly all of<br />\nthe sexual acts in the novel<br />\nare either abortive or<br />\nnon-satisfying. Isadora Wing's<br />\nfears prevent her from being<br />\ntruly \"uninhibited.\"<br />\nFortunately for the good<br />\npeople at Signet Publishing<br />\nthe book has found universal<br />\nappeal, with letters still<br />\nflowing to the author from<br />\nreaders amazed that they are<br />\nnot the only one with such<br />\nthoughts. Isadora gets the<br />\nhornies. Apparently so do a<br />\nlot of real-life people; a<br />\ngodawful amount of those<br />\nwho were told not to.<br />\nAnd even though Erica<br />\nJong has managed to get<br />\nthrough the layers upon<br />\nlayers of porno-promo, she<br />\nstill remains a victim and a<br />\nsymbol for most of us,<br />\nbecause we have all been<br />\nvictims; because we have also<br />\nbeen on the other side. We are<br />\njust as responsible as Signet<br />\n<br />\nPublishers for the way Erica<br />\nJong had to be marketed.<br />\n\"Cheap thrills\" is our<br />\nwatchword.<br />\nPerhaps with the publishing<br />\nof her new volume of poetry<br />\nLoveroot, Erica Jong will be<br />\ngiven the credit she is due.<br />\nThe new collection is<br />\npowerful with a greater sense<br />\nof maturity than her earlier<br />\nwork, giving the poet a<br />\nbroader scope of vision. Jong<br />\ncontinues her thoughful habit<br />\nof placing quotes from<br />\nvarious inspiring sources.<br />\nReading her books is<br />\nsometimes like being in a<br />\nlecture hall where Jong is the<br />\nmain attraction with other<br />\npoets and scholars<br />\ncommenting.<br />\n<br />\nOf Whitman she writes,<br />\n\"You believed in your soul/ &<br />\nbelieving, you made others/<br />\nbelieve in theirs.\" Isadora<br />\nwing had to cavort through a<br />\nwhole novel before she began<br />\nto believe in herself. But<br />\nbelieving in your own self is<br />\nnot so easy. According to<br />\nJong, \"One's own experience<br />\nis less convincing than the<br />\ncultural norm.\" Not so hard<br />\nto understand, though. In this<br />\nage of the mass market it isn't<br />\nfinancially attractive to<br />\nencourage a society of<br />\nindividuals. Ms. Jong's poetry<br />\nis a reflection of her struggle<br />\nagainst becoming a part of the<br />\ngiant cogwheel.<br />\n\"Mash Notes to the Dead &<br />\n<br />\nis the start/ of loneliness/ &<br />\nloneliness the start/ of<br />\npoetry.\" But loneliness is a<br />\ndifficult road and few embark<br />\non it willingly. It is the artist<br />\nwho studies his fears in his<br />\nsolitude and can express them<br />\nwith the written word. Erica<br />\nJong is fortunate to gain a<br />\nreadership during her lifetime.<br />\nSome of the victims she<br />\nremembers were not so lucky.<br />\nThe second section,\"In the<br />\nPenile Colony,\" embodies<br />\nsome of Ms. Jong's views on<br />\nthis male dominated world<br />\nand some of the tragedies it<br />\nhas created. Parable of the<br />\nFour-Poster is the story of A<br />\nwho wants B, but does not<br />\nsay anything; of B who wants<br />\n<br />\n.41<br />\n<br />\nLoveroot opens with a<br />\nsection entitled,\"Mash Notes<br />\nto the Dead & Letters to the<br />\nLiving.\" The first poem,<br />\nTestament (Or Homage to<br />\nWalt Whitman), is an<br />\nexuberant declaration simply<br />\nfor joy, a commodity which,<br />\nJong explains, is rare. This is a<br />\ndramatic jump for the poet in<br />\nterms of tone. \"If the<br />\napocalypse is/ coming,/ let us<br />\nwait for it in joy.\" She tells<br />\nus that the joy seekers have to<br />\nhuddle together.\"I say to hell<br />\nwith anyone/ who would suck<br />\non misery/ like a pacifier/ in a<br />\ntoothless mouth.\" Do not<br />\neven waste your time with the<br />\nbad. There is too much of it<br />\nalready.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Living\"<br />\ncontinues the Erica Jong<br />\ntradition of remembering the<br />\nvictims. Her work is dedicated<br />\nto all the women who have<br />\n\"died in childbirth for the<br />\nRights of Man.\" She asks us<br />\nto remember Jane<br />\nAusten,--she never<br />\nmarried --Emily<br />\nD i ck inson,--rarely published<br />\nduring her lifetime because<br />\nnot make<br />\nshe would<br />\nthose small alterations to her<br />\nwork--Sara Teasdale, Virginia<br />\nWoolf, Pablo Neruda--he died<br />\nof cancer twelve days after<br />\nSalvador Allende and his<br />\nChile fell to the Fascists--and,<br />\nof course, Sylvia Plath. \"Birth<br />\n<br />\nA, but finding no reaction<br />\nfrom her, goes to C. When B<br />\ngoes away, A finds D. B<br />\nmarries C, and A marries D.<br />\nThey go to bed with their<br />\nspouses thinking of each<br />\nother: \"a four-way mistake.\"<br />\nThis is the world of the<br />\n\"squalling boring baby boys.\"<br />\nInterestingly enough, in one<br />\nof her earlier books, Fruits &<br />\nVegetables, Jong wrote a<br />\npoem about having<br />\nintercourse with the muse.<br />\nThe muses are generally<br />\nthought of as female. There is<br />\nsome precedence for the muse<br />\nas a male. Emily Dickinson<br />\ndid have a lawyer friend<br />\nnamed Higginson whom she<br />\nregarded as a muse. Nothing<br />\nlike upsetting the sexual<br />\n<br />\nstereotypes.<br />\nJong's comments on the<br />\nwomen of America have been<br />\nno less harsh than her<br />\nassessment of the men: \"I<br />\npraise their cherry frost lips &<br />\nthe ivory blizzards/ of their<br />\nfingernails/. . .their candied<br />\nbrandy toenails/. . . their<br />\nsprayed and powdered<br />\ncrotches.\" The criticism of<br />\nthe women came first in the<br />\npoet's work. This is an<br />\nindication that she was<br />\nworking on knowing her own<br />\nsoul before anyone else's.<br />\nIn Cold Comfort to a Man<br />\nwith a Growing Daughter (for<br />\nJohn Updike), Jong says,\"do<br />\nnot curse/ the man/ who<br />\nfucks/ your dapghter./ You<br />\nstole another/ old man's<br />\nlaughter,/ too.\" In much the<br />\nsame way, we are all quite<br />\nready to condemn others for<br />\nbehavior we ourselves<br />\nsubscribe to in that<br />\nrationalized circumstance. It<br />\nharks back to the concept<br />\nthat there is already too much<br />\nhatred in the world and there<br />\nis never any excuse for us to<br />\nadd to it. Donald Barthelme<br />\nhere at Hopkins last semester<br />\nsaid, \"I am hopeful because I<br />\nhave to be.\" This is the spirit<br />\nErica Jong is writing in.<br />\nThe final section of<br />\nLoveroot, \"Hungering,\" takes<br />\non Ms. Jong's recurring theme<br />\nof love as a sickness. In her<br />\nsecond book of poetry,<br />\nHalf-Lives, Jong wrote, \"I<br />\nlove this sickness more than<br />\nlife./ There is no cure.\" The<br />\npoet reveals her appetite to us<br />\nin the hope that we will learn<br />\nto do the same. But Jong<br />\nwarns us that she will make<br />\nno concessions: \"Civilize me-/<br />\nif you can.\" Erica Jong has<br />\nsucceeded in overcoming her<br />\nfears to learn who she is-- to<br />\ngain a voice.<br />\nLife is not as dangerous<br />\nas mother said.<br />\nIt is more dangerous<br />\nmore wide.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letter/january 23, 1976<br />\n<br />\nTO WITNESS THE PERFECT CRIME<br />\nYOU MUST COME ON TIME<br />\n<br />\neris-<br />\n<br />\n'Tx,<br />\n<br />\nThe story and suspense of \"Sleuth\" are so unique<br />\nyou must see it from the very beginning.<br />\n<br />\nII.<br />\n<br />\nThu41eeiztc<br />\ni<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n(It<br />\n)4<br />\n<br />\nTtcats<br />\nlarea<br />\n<br />\n1/1) 171.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n2<br />\n:<br />\n\u2022e.\u2022<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\nS.\u2022\u2022\u2022:.:i:\u2022<br />\n<br />\nPALOMAR PIC-TIMES INT1112NATI()NAL present.,<br />\n<br />\nLAURENCE MICHAEL<br />\nCAINE<br />\nOLIVIER<br />\nin JOSEPH<br />\n<br />\nL MANKIEWICZ hIrn of<br />\n<br />\nScrvenp415 tr, ANTHONY SHAFFER<br />\nth.illy by ANTHONY SHAFFER<br />\nIJuJb MOPTON Goi-ruEB<br />\nEwcuow Droduivr EIXIAPJ SCHEPICK<br />\nDuNN-ted II, JOSEPH I.

Thus<br />\na rock takes on animated<br />\nqualitites when you shell out<br />\nfour bucks. The Pop Culture<br />\nis a pulp culture, so cheap and<br />\nsuperficial it is surprising any<br />\nnormal person pays the Pop<br />\nCulture any credence. The<br />\nmain problem with the Pop<br />\nCulture is that nobody cares<br />\nanymore,- culture has become<br />\nsomething one acquires<br />\nthrough buying rather than<br />\nstudying. The American<br />\npeople<br />\nhave become<br />\nculturally passive, afraid to<br />\ndelve beneath the material<br />\nsurface, afraid of what they<br />\nmay discover.<br />\n<br />\nBrawn still hoping to find brain<br />\n<br />\nGET INVOLVED<br />\n<br />\nSUMMER JOBS<br />\n<br />\nself-expression is good<br />\nexpression. Also in this<br />\ngod-forsaken category is that<br />\nparagon of Pop: Bob Dyla.i.<br />\nDylan's true shallowness hides<br />\nbehind obscure lyrics, whose<br />\nvery obscurity qualifies as art<br />\nin the Pop Culture. Like all<br />\nthe other elements of the Pop<br />\nCulture, Dylan is afraid to<br />\nconfront reality. Togethet<br />\nwith the sloppy electricity of<br />\nrock 'n' roll bands, they raise<br />\ntheir cacophonous voices to a<br />\nculture that neither questions<br />\nnor doubts. Somehow I can't<br />\nimagine my wife and I thirty<br />\nyears from now listening to<br />\nsome nostalgic band playing<br />\n\"Born to Run\" and I turn to<br />\nher and say, \"Dear, they're<br />\nplaying our song.\"<br />\n<br />\nPiano<br />\nVoice<br />\nFlute<br />\nGuitar<br />\nDrums<br />\nRegister now for<br />\nbeginner classes in<br />\nrecorder and guitar<br />\n<br />\nAPPLICANTS MUST APPLY EARLY.<br />\n<br />\nCall 889-8074<br />\nor 243-7493<br />\n<br />\nstudents in an effort to get<br />\nthe best athletes available.<br />\nRecently the State Board<br />\nof Higher Education of<br />\nOregon gave the Chancellor<br />\nthe power to change<br />\nadmissions requirements for<br />\nOregon's state universities.<br />\nThe reason for this ruling was<br />\nthat some university<br />\npresidents feared that<br />\nOregon's higher admissions<br />\nstandards have<br />\n\"discriminated \u2014 against<br />\nathletes who possibly wanted<br />\nto attend college in Oregon.<br />\nThe GPA requirements ofr<br />\nout-of-state transfers and<br />\nentering freshmen will<br />\nprobably be lowered to the<br />\nlevel of in-state requirements,<br />\nfrom a 2.5 to a 2.0 for<br />\nfreshmen and from a 2.75 to<br />\na 2.5 for transfers.<br />\nThe problem with lowering<br />\nadmissions requirements to<br />\nbolster the athletic<br />\ndepartment is that universities<br />\noften cannot keep their sports<br />\nheroes from dropping or<br />\nflunking out. This low<br />\ngraduation rate for athletes<br />\nworried the director of<br />\nlhletics at Marshall<br />\nlniversity in Huntington.<br />\nW.V. so much that he<br />\ninitiated a study to find out<br />\nwhere all his athletes were<br />\ngoing.

Through the Pop<br />\nCulture, movies, more so than<br />\nanything else, have insidiously<br />\ninfiltrated the American<br />\nconsciousness. There is a<br />\ncertain amount of unneeded<br />\nreference paid to movies that<br />\nhas elevated a mish-mosh<br />\nmedium to an esteemed art<br />\nform. Because of its technical<br />\nlimitations, specifically the<br />\nspatial distance between film<br />\nand audience, movies are<br />\nnothing more than enriched<br />\nentertainment sentenced to a<br />\nshallow artistic level. All<br />\nacross the country colleges<br />\nare offering highly<br />\nacademically-oriented courses<br />\non the art of film. These<br />\ncourses are merely studies in<br />\ntechnique rather than content<br />\n(for there is no content ot<br />\nstudy), much on the<br />\nintellectual level of a high<br />\nschool shop course.<br />\nMovie Mania<br />\nLast summer when \"Jaws\"<br />\nappeared, the American<br />\npublic was totally suckered<br />\nby this turkey of a movie.<br />\nPeople rushed to their local<br />\ntheatre as if their Messiah was<br />\nappearing live doing a<br />\nsoftshoe. Business at beaches<br />\ndropped drastically as the<br />\ngullible public feared for their<br />\nlives at the jaws of man-eating<br />\nSe/achii. There is something<br />\nwrong with a culture that acts<br />\nin such a spectactularly<br />\nimpulsive manner over just a<br />\nmovie. The Pop Culture has<br />\nmade movies an integral part<br />\nof everyday life. Movies are<br />\ncommonplace escapes from<br />\nthe harsh features of a harsh<br />\nreality.

However, the<br />\nJays broke into the win<br />\ncolumn with their next bout.<br />\nLed by freshman Muraji<br />\nNakazawa and sophomore<br />\ncaptain McLin Hawkins (a<br />\ntransfer student from West<br />\nPoint), Hopkinds thumped<br />\nCharles Street rival Loyola,<br />\n33-15. Loyola took an early<br />\nlead, but several consecutive<br />\nvictories in the late bouts<br />\nassured the Homewood<br />\nvictory.<br />\n<br />\nThis past Saturday, the<br />\nBlue Jays travelled to<br />\nLebanon Valley where they<br />\nparticipated in a quadrangular<br />\nmeet against three different<br />\ncolleges, including the host<br />\nschool.

It seems that the<br />\ncoalition of Socialists and<br />\nChristian Democrats which<br />\npresently controls the<br />\ngovernment, will be unable to<br />\nweather another crisis, and<br />\nthe Communists will enter the<br />\ngovernment. Another<br /><br />\npossibitity would be a<br />\npreemptive coup by the<br />\nArmed Forces and other<br />\nauthoritarian elements.<br />\nThe course was timely .<br />\nbecause of a growing trend in<br />\nFrance and Italy for- the<br />\nelectorate to register its<br />\ndissatisfaction- with a<br />\ndeteriorating economic and<br />\nsocial situation by voting<br />\nCommunist, whether they are<br />\nMarxist or not.

He was<br />\nbrilliant, it was thought, but<br />\nInevitably neurotic. He would<br />\n\"burn out\" after a few years,<br />\nand cease being productive.<br />\nThe gifted was thought to be<br />\nsomehow condemned by his<br />\nvery precocity.<br />\nThe following year, in the<br />\nmidst of such prejudice, Dr.<br />\n'Louis Terman, the man<br />\nresponsible for the<br />\nStanford-Binet IQ test, began<br />\na Study of the gifted youth.<br />\n1 .300 youngsters from<br />\nCalifornia, all with a<br />\nminimum IQ of 140, were<br />\nchosen for the study, the<br />\nnature of which was to<br />\nmonitor the progress of these<br />\nindividuals for the 'rest of<br />\ntheir lives. Terman published<br />\nfive volumes of Genetic<br />\nStudies of -Genius The work<br />\noutlived Terman, who died in<br />\n1959. In 1968 a monograph<br />\nwritten by Melita Oden of<br />\nStanford University described<br />\nthe forty year follow-up of<br />\nthe Terman Gifted Group.<br />\nThe study showed a high<br />\ndegree of accomplishment<br />\nand personal satisfaction with<br />\ntheir lives among the gifted. It<br />\nsuccessfully disproved many<br />\nof the assumptions that had<br />\nbeen prevalent at the study's<br />\ninception. The Terman Study,<br />\nhowever, was a passive.<br />\nObservatory approach to the<br />\nmatter. Controversy<br /><br />\ncontinued over the subject of<br />\njust how the precocious<br />\nyouth ought to be handled.<br />\nWas educational acceleration<br />\nthe answer? Would it be<br />\nbeneficial to the gifted? If it<br />\nwas, how should it be done?<br />\nUsing Terman's work as a<br />\nbasis, Dr. Julian Stanley of<br />\nthe Hopkins Psych. Dept. has<br />\nfurther researched the gifted.<br />\nOne difference between<br />\nSMPY and Terman is the new<br />\nstudy's emphasis on<br />\nmathematically precocious<br />\nstudents. But the essential<br />\ndifference is that while the<br />\nTerman study was passive,<br />\nSMPY is \"strongly<br />\ninterventional\", in furthering<br />\nthe progress of the gifted<br />\nchild. Dr. Stanley's research<br />\n(SMPY works with many<br />\nacademicians devoted to the<br />\nfield, including Dr. Lynn Fox<br />\nof the Evening College) has<br />\nconvinced him of the benefits<br />\nof properly administered<br />\nacceleration for the gifted.<br />\nCase in Point<br />\nSeven years ago,<br />\ntwelve-year old Joseph Bates<br />\nwas brought to the attention<br />\nof Dr. Stanley. When tested,<br />\nJoseph scored a 590 on a SAT<br />\nverbal test, and 669 on a SAT<br />\nmath test. In eighth grade,<br />\nand without having taken any<br />\ncourses in general science,<br />\nJoseph scored a 752 on a<br />\nPhysics achievement. Yet the<br />\npublic schools refused to<br />\nprovide Joseph with any<br />\naccess to advanced courses,<br />\nand the private schools<br />\noffered no alternatives. Under<br />\nthe guidance of Dr. Stanley,<br />\nJoseph was put into a<br />\nfast-math program in which<br />\nhe was taught 51<br />\n/<br />\n2 years of<br />\nprecalculus mathematics in<br />\n120 hours. He went from<br />\ngrade 6 to 8 to 11 to 14,<br />\nentering Hopkins as a<br />\nsophomore at the age of 14.<br />\nHe graduated at 17 with a BA<br />\nin quantitative studies. Three<br />\nmonths later he had his -'MS'<br />\nHe is currently in his third<br /><br />\nyear of a doctoral program at<br />\nCornell.

Personal<br />\nmotivation of the youth is the<br />\nforemost consideration inn<br />\nany acceleration.

Dr. Stanley claims that<br />\nof those accelerated, there has<br />\nbeen only one instance of a<br />\nyouth not performing<br />\nexceptionally (In terms of<br />\ncollege grades, this means<br />\nmostly A's, and some B's.).<br />\nAt this point it becomes<br />\nnecessary to deal with the<br />\njustification for what SMPY<br />\ndoes. 'In an interview with the<br />\nNewsletter, Dr. Stanley<br />\ncharacterized the gifted child<br />\nas a socially retarde-d<br />\nindividual, a person held back<br />\nby a system too slwo for him.<br />\nIn a paper which appeared in<br />\nThe Gifted Child Quarterly,<br />\nhe wrote, \"Persons who hear<br />\nabout our study usually ask,<br />\n'But what about the social<br />\nand emotional development<br />\nof the students who become<br />\naccelerated?'

Ile was<br />\nthe victim of a classic<br />\ngangland execution, one that<br />\nwas suspiciously similar to a<br />\nscene in the most famous film<br />\nof the day, \"The Godfather.\"<br />\nGallo's obituaries depicted<br />\nhim as a mean and hard-nosed<br />\nkiller, a \"maverick mafioso\"<br />\nwho boasted of being picked<br />\nup by the cops 150 times.<br />\nThe newsweeklies told tales<br />\nof Gallo \"puncturing his<br />\nenemies with iee picks just for<br />\nthe hell of it\" and \"gaining<br />\nstatus by serving as a member<br />\nf a five man execution squad<br /><br />\ndirtected by mafia boss Joe<br />\nProfaci in the late fifties.<br />\nGallo's was the most difficult<br />\nkind of death for the public<br />\nto react to; no one likes to<br />\nhear of death, particularly<br />\ncold-blooded murder, but in<br />\nGallo's case only an insider<br />\ncould share in his family's<br />\ngrief. In short, public school<br />\nin New York was not closed<br />\nin mourning for Joey Gallo.<br />\nNot even in Little Italy.<br />\nTherefore, it is not<br />\nsurprising that a number of<br />\npeople, especially New<br />\nYorkers, are perplexed by<br />\nBob Dylan's glorification of<br />\nJoey Gallo's crime and<br />\nbullet-ridden life on his latest<br />\nalbum,Desire.<br />\nDylan takes a professed<br />\n\"hard-as-nails\" gangster and<br />\nportrays him as a family man<br />\nwho, as a pawn of chance,<br />\nwas led astray. According to<br />\nDylan, Gallo never carried a<br />\ngun because \"I'm around too<br />\nmany children, they should<br />\nneven know of one.\" He sings<br />\nof Gallo's release from Attica<br />\nprison; \"they let him out in<br />\n'71, he lost a little weight, but<br />\nhe dressed like Jimmy<br />\nCagney, and I swear he did<br />\nlook great.\" To one who is<br />\nnot familiar with Gallo the<br />\nromanticism is just another<br />\nelement of the song, meshed<br />\nwell with Dylan's finest vocal<br />\nand phrasing on the album.<br />\nHowever, for those who grew<br />\nup reading page three stories<br />\nand photo spreads about<br />\nGallo's killings and mob<br />\ndealings in newspapers like<br />\nthe New York Daily News<br />\nand National Enquirer, the<br />\nsong is unsettling at best.<br />\nDylan's intentions remain a<br />\npuzzle. Was he consciously<br />\nattempting to rescue Gallo<br /><br />\nfrom the ranks of Mafia<br />\ninfamy or was he taken in by<br />\nthe folksy aura that \"led<br />\nsome of his superficial<br />\nacquantances to consider him<br />\na sort of folk hero\"? It's hard<br />\nto believe that Dylan, a<br />\nresident of New York<br />\nthroughout the sixties, would<br />\nwrite such a naive ballad<br />\nabout a mobster who<br />\ndelighted in breaking arms<br />\nand spitting at subordinates.<br />\nThey didn't call Joey Gallo<br />\ncrazy for nothing.<br />\nIt seems more probable<br />\nthat Gallo's new status as a<br />\nmartyr and folk hero was<br />\ncalculated very carefully by<br />\nDylan. By decriminalizing<br />\nGallo, Dylan has placed Gallo<br /><br />\non the pedestal shared by the<br />\nlikes of Jesse James and Billy<br />\nthe Kid, two of the<br />\nsongwriter's favorite models<br />\nin previous work. James and<br />\nBilly the Kid have been<br />\ncloaked in mystique since<br />\ntheir death and as the years<br />\npass their image grows while<br />\ntheir villainous lives are<br />\nforgotten. Of course, it takes<br />\nmore than one song for a<br />\nlegend of this type to catch<br />\non, but it is songs like \"Joey\"<br />\nthat add to a myth and spread<br />\nit.<br />\nThirty years from now,<br />\nafter Gallo's crimes have been<br />\nforgotten, the gangster will<br />\nhave been transformed into<br />\n\"Joey, king of the streets,<br /><br />\nchild of clay.\" All that will<br />\nsurvive will be the legend of<br />\nJoey Gallo and Dylan will be<br />\nlost in the years, for a legend<br />\nis bigger than any man.<br />\nThat Dylan uses a<br />\ncontemporary gangster as his<br />\nlatest folk model is an<br />\nexample of his desperate need<br />\nfor changing his music and<br />\nwriting. The main differences '<br />\nin Dylan's writing about Gallo<br />\ninstead of the bandit John<br />\nWesley Hardin is that the<br />\nlatter was already an<br />\nestablished legend before'<br />\nDylan was even born. He just<br />\npaid homage to the myth by<br />\nadding another song. But with<br />\nGallo, the implications of the<br />\nsong are more meaningful.<br />\nbecause by eulogizing Gallo<br />\nhe is creating another myth,<br />\ninstead of simply adding to it.<br />\nIn this sense, Dylan is playing<br />\nwith history and folk culture<br />\nby intentionally whitewashing<br />\na man who was repulsive to<br />\nmost of the society in which<br />\nhe lived.<br />\nBy recognizing this process<br />\nit is easy to imagine that Jesse<br />\nJames and John Wesley<br />\nHardin were every bit as<br />\nnotorious and gun thirsty as<br />\nGallo. Dylan realizes this.<br />\nwhich is why he titles the song<br />\nas anonymous \"Joey\"<br />\ninstead of something more<br />\ndirect like \"The Ballad of<br />\nJoey Gallo.\" That was the<br />\nfirst step in Gallo's<br />\ndecriminalization.<br />\nWhether Dylan's sense of<br />\nmorality and historical<br />\nperspective are out of line is<br />\nsomething that most listeners<br />\nwill not be able to agree on.<br />\nBut, like it or not, there now<br />\nV seems to be one more myth<br />\nto deal with: .the legend of<br />\ncrazy Joe.<br /><br />\nDylan's new ip and a mix ofRolling Thunder Sunrise<br />\nBy DAVID HAWK<br />\nAs the reverberations of<br />\nRolling Thunder echoed<br />\ntIi roughout the East Coast.<br />\nwith them went Desire.

His albums, which came<br />\nout between 1969 and 1973<br />\nwere regarded by many to be<br />\nmediocre. and fans were<br />\nanxiously inquiring about<br />\nwhat had happened to the<br />\n\"old Dylan magic.\" With<br />\nDesire's latest appearance. it<br />\nis now clear that Dylan was<br />\nmerely growing up during<br />\nwhat appeared to be a<br />\nfatal dry spell. By the<br />\nper<br />\nend of 1967. Dylan realized<br />\nthat the trends of the sixties<br /><br />\nhad all been put in motion<br />\nand that it was time to look to<br />\nthe seventies. Now, after New<br />\nMorning's (1970) false start,<br />\nhe has produced a polished<br />\nwork of art which has<br />\nsilenced cries for \"the old<br />\nDylan\" and created a furor<br />\nabout the \"new Dylan.\"<br />\nThe title of the album is<br />\nespecially apt. Throughout his<br />\ncareer, the poetic and<br />\nemotional intensity of<br />\nDylan's music has been<br />\neffective enough to cause<br />\nmany to conclude that Dylan<br />\ngave the generation of the<br />\nsixties a voice. Dylan's songs<br />\nsomehow capture the travail<br />\nof a new awareness struggling<br />\nto be born, the groping of a<br />\ndecade. His songs reveal a<br />\nsearch for justice. love, and<br />\nthat which every artist<br />\ndeserves: the opportunity to<br />\nredeem himself. His<br />\nemotional genius enables him<br />\nto search and desire for others<br />\nas well<br />\nKeeping this in mind, it is<br />\nnone the less important to<br />\nnote the basic developments<br />\nwhich have been effected in<br /><br />\nDylan's music. On the album,<br />\nJacques Levy co-authored<br />\nseven of the nine songs with<br />\nDylan. Levy's ability to<br />\ncompose and innovate<br />\nmusically have enabled Dylan<br />\nto strengthen his songs of<br />\ndesire. With Levy's guidance,<br />\nDylan is using his voice in<br />\nnew and exciting ways, and<br />\nEmmylou Harris' background<br />\nvocals and Scarlet Rivera's<br />\nelectric violin blend well with<br />\nthe innovations in rhythm.<br />\nthrust, and tone which Levy<br />\nand Dylan have combined to<br />\nproduce. The result is music<br />\nwhich is sometimes haunting<br />\nand poignant, and at other<br />\ntimes light and relentless, but<br />\nwhich always evidences<br />\nimagination and defies<br />\ncomplacent listening.<br />\nHurricane<br />\n\"Hurricane.\" the first song<br />\non the album, represents<br />\nDylan's attempt to vindicate<br />\nimprisoned Hurricane Carter,<br />\nand thus his desire for justice.<br />\nCarter's innocence or guilt has<br />\nnot really been established,<br />\nbut Dylan's distrust of the<br />\nequity of the legal system is.<br /><br />\nIn \"Absolutely Sweet Marie\"<br />\n(1966) he wrote: \"To live<br />\noutside the law you must be<br />\nhonest.\" In \"Chimes of<br />\nFreedom\" (1964) he<br />\nproclaimed: \"Chimes of<br />\nfreedom...flashin'...for every<br />\nharmless gentle soul who's<br />\nbeen placed inside a jail.\"<br />\nAnother sort of desire<br />\nwhich is pictured in the<br />\nalbum is Dylan's love for his<br />\nwife, Sara. \"Isis\" is a<br />\nsomewhat mystical account<br />\nof his fateful encounter with<br />\nSara Lowndes in 1965.<br />\n\"Sara\" is a somewhat more<br />\nconventional confession of<br />\nthe adoration which produced<br />\nthe most complex and<br />\nhaunting love song ever done<br />\nby a popular artist, \"Sad-eyed<br />\nLady of the Lowlands.\"<br />\n\"I can still remember those<br />\nMethodist bells,<br />\nI'd taken the cure and I'd<br />\njust gotten through<br />\nStayin' up for days in a<br />\nChelsea hotel<br />\nWritin\"Sad-Eyed Lady of<br />\nthe Lowlands' for you.\"<br />\n\"Oh Sister\" is an<br />\nexpression of love which steps<br /><br />\noutside the narrow bounds of<br />\nsexual politics and traditional<br />\nmale-female love songs. and in<br />\nits desire for a compassionate<br />\nlove it marks Dylan's<br />\nmaturity:<br />\n\"Oh sister, when I come to<br />\nlie in your arms,<br />\nYou should not treat me<br />\nlike a stranger...<br />\nDon't turn away\u2014<br />\nYou'll create sorrow...\"<br />\nDylan's desires for love and<br />\njustice come together in a<br />\nquiet song of Mexican flavor<br />\nwhich is easy to overlook:<br />\n\"Romance in Durango.\" It<br />\ntells of a man who commits<br />\nan unpremeditated crime, and<br />\nwho, surprised to find himself<br />\na criminal, must escape<br />\nDurango, accompanied only<br />\nby his lover.

Inaccurate<br />\nassessment of questionnaire results, however, can only<br />\nhave a detrimental effect on sound course selection and<br />\nstudent-faculty relations.<br /><br />\nA New Hampshire experience<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\nNashua New Hampshire is<br />\nlike a woman. She will be<br />\ntantalizingly warm with a<br />\nbalmy 30o in the daytime...<br />\nand then whip up twenty mile<br />\nper hour winds as the<br />\ntemperature drops to 10o<br />\nbelow zero at night. There<br />\nwere times when I wondered<br />\nwhether this phenomenon<br />\nwas natural or a ploy by some<br />\nhigher authority to discourage<br />\nthe assorted ne'er \u2014 do \u2014<br />\nwells who trek on the icy<br />\nNew England roads every four<br />\nyears, plugging away for some<br />\ncandidate who in six months<br />\nwill be selling old campaign<br />\nbuttons to a scrap metal<br />\ndealer.<br />\nWith apologies to Dr. Burns<br />\n(see article 1/23/76) the New<br />\nHampshire campaign is not<br />\nquite as amusing as starring in<br />\na porno film. Rather, it is a<br />\ngrueling lesson on how to<br />\ncoax out the most votes for<br />\nyour candidate, avoiding a<br />\nbad back while sleeping on<br />\ntwo sleeping bags, vnd<br />\npraying for a miracle in<br />\nmodern preventive medicine<br />\nas you co-habit an area with a<br />\nhalf wolf\u2014half dog who has<br />\nyet to be dewormed. A<br />\nprimary campaign is not for<br />\nthose with picky appetites<br />\neither; unless one considers<br />\npeanut butter on anything<br />\nwith a glass of milk to be the<br />\npinnacle of haute cuisine.<br />\nStill, involving myself in<br />\nthe Udall effort gave me both<br />\na renewed interest in a<br />\ncampaign which has been<br />\nhighlighted by Ronald Reagan<br />\nchipping a capped tooth as he<br />\nput his foot into mouth.<br />\nMoreover, I caught a glimpse<br />\nof how pleasant life can be in<br />\na city with little to fear but<br />\nthe \"foreign hordes\" which<br /><br />\nonly pop up every four years;<br />\nit seems the major crime wave<br />\nin Nashua was a rash of<br />\nChristmas shoplifting.<br />\nThe key words to<br />\nremember when knocking<br />\ndoors in Nashua is to be as<br />\nsoft spoken and innocuous as<br />\npossible. New Englanders are<br />\nnot as cold as their weather,<br />\njust reserved. Suffice to say<br />\nthat Long Islanders would not<br />\nbe the greatest campaign<br />\nworkers in this region.<br />\nAccording to Udall's director<br />\nof canvassing, Mark<br />\nYoungholm, the most<br />\nimportant impression a<br />\ncampaigner can make on a<br />\nvoter's memory will be that<br />\nof a student braving the cold<br />\nand snow simply to work for<br />\nMo Udall.<br />\nVagueness<br />\nSometimes this approach<br />\nsucceeds, no matter how<br />\nmasochistic it sounds. At<br />\ntimes, though, the only thing<br />\na potential Udall voter will<br />\nsay is \"Damn, you must be a<br />\nmoron for being out there.\"<br />\nThe New Hampshire<br />\nprimary is not crucial in the<br />\nsense that the winner gets a<br />\nlarge delegation at the<br />\nnational convention, for New<br />\nHampshire only has seventeen<br />\nvotes. What makes the state<br />\ngrow out of proportion in<br />\nrelation to political strength,<br />\nis that the winner of the<br />\ncontest receives tremendous<br />\nimmediate coverage from the<br />\nnational press with all the<br />\nbenefits that exposure brings<br />\nwith it (cash, volunteers,<br />\nendorsements). Additionally,<br />\nit helps make also-rans out of<br />\nsome aspirants for the Oval<br />\noffice, and thus cuts the<br />\nDemocratic field from one<br />\nresembling the race up San<br />\nJuan Hill to one bearing a<br /><br />\nsimilarity to the fifth at<br />\nAqueduct. What is equally<br />\nremarkable about this<br />\nelection is that it can make<br />\nwinners of the final tally into<br />\nlosers: few people will<br />\nremember that LBJ beat<br />\nEugene McCarthy there in<br />\n1968, or that a 'tearful'<br />\nEdmund Muskie defeated<br />\nGeorge McGovern, putting<br />\nthe Democratic Party in a<br />\nstate of chaos. From the<br />\nnumber of Demociatic voters<br />\nmet, who are supporting<br />\nRonald Reagan, it appears<br />\nthat President Ford may yet<br />\nbe another name placed on<br />\nthat list of vanquished victors.<br />\nPresently, chances are that<br />\nthe democratic winner will<br />\nprobably be either Jimmy<br />\nCarter or Udall. Both men<br />\nseem to have the best<br />\ncampaign organizations.<br />\nefficient campaign techniques<br />\nand most critically, the<br />\ngreatest number of volunteers<br />\nto canvass the state with. If<br />\nUdall does win, he will get a<br />\nneeded boost after the<br />\ndisastrous Iowa caucus and<br />\nperhaps gain enough<br />\nmomentum to place in the<br />\ntop three in the Massachusetts<br />\nprimary. Carter, on the other<br />\nhand, should be well satisfied<br />\nwith a second place finish in a<br />\nYankee state, especially after<br />\nhis Iowa victory and an<br />\nexpected moral triumph over<br />\nGeorge Wallace at the<br />\nMississippi caucus. Should the<br />\nformer Georgian governor<br />\nlead the pack in New<br />\nHampshire, though, and<br />\nsubsequently make strong .<br />\nshowings in North Carolina,<br />\nFlorida, and Illinois, Carter<br />\nmay well be the de facto<br />\nDemocratic nominee for<br />\npresident come July.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n1 take my teaching<br />\nseriously. I take student<br />\nresponses to my teaching<br />\nseriously. For that reason I<br />\nwish to take the unusual step<br />\nof responding to several<br />\nrelated points in the Fall<br />\n1975 Course Evaluation of<br />\nmy \"Changing China\" course.<br />\nThe course guide, based I<br />\nbelieve in part on an<br />\ninaccurate assessment of<br />\ncertain facts and in part on an<br />\nall -too -reasonable<br />\nmisunderstanding of other<br />\nfacts, states: \"Grading is<br />\nrather strict and even a bit<br />\nprejudicial\u2014i.e., essay exam<br />\nquestions are vague and must<br />\nbe answered just right and<br />\nfavorably to China. Dr.<br />\nPfeffer considers a 'C' a good<br />\ngrade and the majority of<br />\ngrades given out were 'good<br />\ngrades'.\"<br />\nIn response, I do not and<br />\nnever have considered a \"C\" a<br />\ngood grade. Personally, I<br />\nconsider it less than<br />\nsatisfactory work, and I tell<br />\nmy students that. Moreover,<br />\nthe last time the course was<br />\noffered, under the title<br /><br />\n\"China Today,\" the majority<br />\nof grades were not \"C's,\" as<br />\nthe report seems to imply. To<br />\nbe precise, of the 16 grades<br />\ngiven, 3 Were \"A's,\" 7 were<br />\n\"B's\" and only 3 were \"C's:\"<br />\none was a pass and two were<br />\nincompletes. The only<br />\nsubstance to the charge that<br />\n\"grading is rather strict\" is<br />\nthat I have resisted the total<br />\nsurrender to grade inflation<br />\nreflected at Hopkins today.<br />\nMore importantly, the<br />\nreport charges that my<br />\ngrading is \"even a bit<br />\nprejudicial\"\u2014equivalent to<br />\nthe kiss of death in a<br />\n\"value -free,\" liberal<br />\nuniversity. And further that<br />\nessay exam questions are<br />\n\"vague\" and \"must be<br />\nanswered just right and<br />\nfavorably to China.\" This is a<br />\nmore complex and difficult<br />\ncharge to rebut, involving as it<br />\ndoes different ideologies. Let<br />\nme try to respond.<br />\nFirst, I do not think that<br />\nmy grading is any more<br />\n\"prejudicial\" than any other<br />\nprofessor's in the social<br />\nsciences or humanities. My<br />\nprejudices simply are not<br /><br />\nthose widely shared by<br />\nfaculty members and<br />\nstudents, so they are more<br />\nobvious. I do not try to<br />\ndisguise my values.<br />\nNevertheless, I believe I<br />\nrecognize quality work when<br />\nI see it, and I have given<br />\n\"A's\" to well conceived and<br />\nexecuted papers that argued<br />\nMao is a fascist, and<br />\nconversely, I have given \"C's\"<br />\nto poorly written,<br />\nunthoughtful essays that<br />\nsimply parrot \"the line.\" In<br />\nthe final analysis, however, I<br />\nrecognize that one's ideology<br />\ncannot help but influence<br />\nhow one conceives relevance<br />\nand significance. On that<br />\ncount, I would, with the rest<br />\nof humanity, plead guilty.<br />\nSecond, it is true that my<br />\nessay questions are \"vague.\"<br />\nThey are intended to be, so as<br />\nto allow students within a<br />\nwide range to answer them as<br />\nthey think most useful, to<br />\nmake the questions their own.<br />\nThat they must be answered<br />\n\"just right,\" I think is wrong,<br />\nunless by \"right\" is meant<br />\nthat the answer must be<br />\nlogical, well-written,<br /><br />\nargumentative, and with some<br />\nreasonable connection to<br />\nhistorical fact and a<br />\nreasonable use of evidence to<br />\nsupport the arguments. One<br />\nrather frequent, half-pained<br />\ncomment I have had to these<br />\nessay questions is that they<br />\n\"forced\" students to think.<br />\nAnother is that they \"forced\"<br />\nstudents to try to learn how<br />\nto discipline their writing. I<br />\nlike to believe that is what I<br />\nam doing.<br />\nThat essays must be<br />\nfavorable to China to be<br />\nconsidered good is, as<br />\nindicated above, clearly<br />\nwiong as a flat statement. But<br />\nthe matter is more complex<br />\nthan .that. My main<br />\nsubstantive goal in the course<br />\nis to try to enable students to<br />\nunderstand the Chinese<br />\nRevolution in its own terms,<br />\nas the Chinese saw it. We<br />\ncannot understand why and<br />\nhow that revolution has<br />\ndeveloped if we pose liberal<br />\nquestions to twentieth<br />\ncentury China, or if we judge<br />\nChina's Revolution by liberal<br />\nstandards. China has never<br />\nbeen, is not no'w, art does<br /><br />\nnot wish to become a liberal<br />\nsociety<br />\nI demand is not that<br />\nstudents react \"favorably\" to<br />\nthe Chinese Revolution but<br />\nthat they reach an<br />\nunderstanding of the<br />\nrevolution in its own terms as<br />\na basis for whatever ultimate<br />\nevaluation they may wish to<br />\nmake. To do otherwise, it<br />\nseems to me, entails simply<br />\nabdicating on the crucial<br />\nmatter of understanding a<br />\nsociety so different from and<br />\nso alien to our society, and<br />\nresults in self-satisfying<br />\ncondemnations of China as<br />\nilliberal.<br />\nThese are difficult matters<br />\nto cope with. The line<br />\nbetween understanding and<br />\nsympathy, on one hand, and<br />\napology, on the other, can be<br />\nvery fine. I have tried not to<br />\ncross it, though, doubtless, I<br />\nhave made mistakes. On the<br />\nwhole, however, I am willing<br />\nto stand on what I have done<br />\nand on how students have<br />\nresponded.<br />\nThank you.<br />\nRichard M. Pfeffer<br />\nAssociate Professor<br /><br />\nClayton Blick<br /><br />\nPorno-promo<br /><br />\nErica, in spite of it all, you're still coming through<br />\nD. H. WARREN<br />\nThe sky is clearer when I'm<br />\nnot in heat,<br />\n&amp; the poems<br />\nare colder.<br />\nI was recently thumbing<br />\nthrough a friend's dog-eared<br />\ncopy of Fear of Flying and<br />\nbecame rather amused by the<br />\npublishers' claim that the<br />\nbook was the \"wildest, most<br />\nuninhibited sexual<br />\nextravaganza\" ever written.<br />\nSure, go ahead and make your<br />\ncheapest shots to sell sell sell.<br />\nUnderestimate our<br />\nintelligence because that<br />\nusually succeeds. Everybody<br />\nwants to look through a dirty<br />\nbook -- maybe only to put it<br />\ndown, but you still want to<br />\nsee. The alluring unzipping<br />\nfor a cover promised erotic<br />\nfantasy extraordinary -- a<br />\nsure-fire bathroom<br />\ncompanion for all the young<br />\nmen.<br />\nFear of Flying, however, is<br />\nanything but erotic. Jong has<br />\ncalled it, a \"saga of<br />\nunfulfillment.\" Nearly all of<br />\nthe sexual acts in the novel<br />\nare either abortive or<br />\nnon-satisfying. Isadora Wing's<br />\nfears prevent her from being<br />\ntruly \"uninhibited.\"<br />\nFortunately for the good<br />\npeople at Signet Publishing<br />\nthe book has found universal<br />\nappeal, with letters still<br />\nflowing to the author from<br />\nreaders amazed that they are<br />\nnot the only one with such<br />\nthoughts. Isadora gets the<br />\nhornies. Apparently so do a<br />\nlot of real-life people; a<br />\ngodawful amount of those<br />\nwho were told not to.<br />\nAnd even though Erica<br />\nJong has managed to get<br />\nthrough the layers upon<br />\nlayers of porno-promo, she<br />\nstill remains a victim and a<br />\nsymbol for most of us,<br />\nbecause we have all been<br />\nvictims; because we have also<br />\nbeen on the other side. We are<br />\njust as responsible as Signet<br /><br />\nPublishers for the way Erica<br />\nJong had to be marketed.<br />\n\"Cheap thrills\" is our<br />\nwatchword.<br />\nPerhaps with the publishing<br />\nof her new volume of poetry<br />\nLoveroot, Erica Jong will be<br />\ngiven the credit she is due.<br />\nThe new collection is<br />\npowerful with a greater sense<br />\nof maturity than her earlier<br />\nwork, giving the poet a<br />\nbroader scope of vision. Jong<br />\ncontinues her thoughful habit<br />\nof placing quotes from<br />\nvarious inspiring sources.<br />\nReading her books is<br />\nsometimes like being in a<br />\nlecture hall where Jong is the<br />\nmain attraction with other<br />\npoets and scholars<br />\ncommenting.<br /><br />\nOf Whitman she writes,<br />\n\"You believed in your soul/ &amp;<br />\nbelieving, you made others/<br />\nbelieve in theirs.\" Isadora<br />\nwing had to cavort through a<br />\nwhole novel before she began<br />\nto believe in herself. But<br />\nbelieving in your own self is<br />\nnot so easy. According to<br />\nJong, \"One's own experience<br />\nis less convincing than the<br />\ncultural norm.\" Not so hard<br />\nto understand, though. In this<br />\nage of the mass market it isn't<br />\nfinancially attractive to<br />\nencourage a society of<br />\nindividuals. Ms. Jong's poetry<br />\nis a reflection of her struggle<br />\nagainst becoming a part of the<br />\ngiant cogwheel.<br />\n\"Mash Notes to the Dead &amp;<br /><br />\nis the start/ of loneliness/ &amp;<br />\nloneliness the start/ of<br />\npoetry.\" But loneliness is a<br />\ndifficult road and few embark<br />\non it willingly. It is the artist<br />\nwho studies his fears in his<br />\nsolitude and can express them<br />\nwith the written word. Erica<br />\nJong is fortunate to gain a<br />\nreadership during her lifetime.<br />\nSome of the victims she<br />\nremembers were not so lucky.<br />\nThe second section,\"In the<br />\nPenile Colony,\" embodies<br />\nsome of Ms. Jong's views on<br />\nthis male dominated world<br />\nand some of the tragedies it<br />\nhas created. Parable of the<br />\nFour-Poster is the story of A<br />\nwho wants B, but does not<br />\nsay anything; of B who wants<br /><br />\n.41<br /><br />\nLoveroot opens with a<br />\nsection entitled,\"Mash Notes<br />\nto the Dead &amp; Letters to the<br />\nLiving.\" The first poem,<br />\nTestament (Or Homage to<br />\nWalt Whitman), is an<br />\nexuberant declaration simply<br />\nfor joy, a commodity which,<br />\nJong explains, is rare. This is a<br />\ndramatic jump for the poet in<br />\nterms of tone. \"If the<br />\napocalypse is/ coming,/ let us<br />\nwait for it in joy.\" She tells<br />\nus that the joy seekers have to<br />\nhuddle together.\"I say to hell<br />\nwith anyone/ who would suck<br />\non misery/ like a pacifier/ in a<br />\ntoothless mouth.\" Do not<br />\neven waste your time with the<br />\nbad. There is too much of it<br />\nalready.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Living\"<br />\ncontinues the Erica Jong<br />\ntradition of remembering the<br />\nvictims. Her work is dedicated<br />\nto all the women who have<br />\n\"died in childbirth for the<br />\nRights of Man.\" She asks us<br />\nto remember Jane<br />\nAusten,--she never<br />\nmarried --Emily<br />\nD i ck inson,--rarely published<br />\nduring her lifetime because<br />\nnot make<br />\nshe would<br />\nthose small alterations to her<br />\nwork--Sara Teasdale, Virginia<br />\nWoolf, Pablo Neruda--he died<br />\nof cancer twelve days after<br />\nSalvador Allende and his<br />\nChile fell to the Fascists--and,<br />\nof course, Sylvia Plath. \"Birth<br /><br />\nA, but finding no reaction<br />\nfrom her, goes to C. When B<br />\ngoes away, A finds D. B<br />\nmarries C, and A marries D.<br />\nThey go to bed with their<br />\nspouses thinking of each<br />\nother: \"a four-way mistake.\"<br />\nThis is the world of the<br />\n\"squalling boring baby boys.\"<br />\nInterestingly enough, in one<br />\nof her earlier books, Fruits &amp;<br />\nVegetables, Jong wrote a<br />\npoem about having<br />\nintercourse with the muse.<br />\nThe muses are generally<br />\nthought of as female. There is<br />\nsome precedence for the muse<br />\nas a male. Emily Dickinson<br />\ndid have a lawyer friend<br />\nnamed Higginson whom she<br />\nregarded as a muse. Nothing<br />\nlike upsetting the sexual<br /><br />\nstereotypes.<br />\nJong's comments on the<br />\nwomen of America have been<br />\nno less harsh than her<br />\nassessment of the men: \"I<br />\npraise their cherry frost lips &amp;<br />\nthe ivory blizzards/ of their<br />\nfingernails/. . .their candied<br />\nbrandy toenails/. . . their<br />\nsprayed and powdered<br />\ncrotches.\" The criticism of<br />\nthe women came first in the<br />\npoet's work. This is an<br />\nindication that she was<br />\nworking on knowing her own<br />\nsoul before anyone else's.<br />\nIn Cold Comfort to a Man<br />\nwith a Growing Daughter (for<br />\nJohn Updike), Jong says,\"do<br />\nnot curse/ the man/ who<br />\nfucks/ your dapghter./ You<br />\nstole another/ old man's<br />\nlaughter,/ too.\" In much the<br />\nsame way, we are all quite<br />\nready to condemn others for<br />\nbehavior we ourselves<br />\nsubscribe to in that<br />\nrationalized circumstance. It<br />\nharks back to the concept<br />\nthat there is already too much<br />\nhatred in the world and there<br />\nis never any excuse for us to<br />\nadd to it.

Many good jobs are available!<br /><br />\nI suppose what it all boils<br />\ndown to is that the Pop<br />\nCulture is based totally on<br />\nmoney, material things. Thus<br />\na rock takes on animated<br />\nqualitites when you shell out<br />\nfour bucks. The Pop Culture<br />\nis a pulp culture, so cheap and<br />\nsuperficial it is surprising any<br />\nnormal person pays the Pop<br />\nCulture any credence. The<br />\nmain problem with the Pop<br />\nCulture is that nobody cares<br />\nanymore,- culture has become<br />\nsomething one acquires<br />\nthrough buying rather than<br />\nstudying. The American<br />\npeople<br />\nhave become<br />\nculturally passive, afraid to<br />\ndelve beneath the material<br />\nsurface, afraid of what they<br />\nmay discover.<br /><br />\nBrawn still hoping to find brain<br /><br />\nGET INVOLVED<br /><br />\nSUMMER JOBS<br /><br />\nself-expression is good<br />\nexpression. Also in this<br />\ngod-forsaken category is that<br />\nparagon of Pop: Bob Dyla.i.<br />\nDylan's true shallowness hides<br />\nbehind obscure lyrics, whose<br />\nvery obscurity qualifies as art<br />\nin the Pop Culture. Like all<br />\nthe other elements of the Pop<br />\nCulture, Dylan is afraid to<br />\nconfront reality. Togethet<br />\nwith the sloppy electricity of<br />\nrock 'n' roll bands, they raise<br />\ntheir cacophonous voices to a<br />\nculture that neither questions<br />\nnor doubts. Somehow I can't<br />\nimagine my wife and I thirty<br />\nyears from now listening to<br />\nsome nostalgic band playing<br />\n\"Born to Run\" and I turn to<br />\nher and say, \"Dear, they're<br />\nplaying our song.\"<br /><br />\nPiano<br />\nVoice<br />\nFlute<br />\nGuitar<br />\nDrums<br />\nRegister now for<br />\nbeginner classes in<br />\nrecorder and guitar<br /><br />\nAPPLICANTS MUST APPLY EARLY.<br /><br />\nCall 889-8074<br />\nor 243-7493<br /><br />\nstudents in an effort to get<br />\nthe best athletes available.<br />\nRecently the State Board<br />\nof Higher Education of<br />\nOregon gave the Chancellor<br />\nthe power to change<br />\nadmissions requirements for<br />\nOregon's state universities.<br />\nThe reason for this ruling was<br />\nthat some university<br />\npresidents feared that<br />\nOregon's higher admissions<br />\nstandards have<br />\n\"discriminated \u2014 against<br />\nathletes who possibly wanted<br />\nto attend college in Oregon.<br />\nThe GPA requirements ofr<br />\nout-of-state transfers and<br />\nentering freshmen will<br />\nprobably be lowered to the<br />\nlevel of in-state requirements,<br />\nfrom a 2.5 to a 2.0 for<br />\nfreshmen and from a 2.75 to<br />\na 2.5 for transfers.<br />\nThe problem with lowering<br />\nadmissions requirements to<br />\nbolster the athletic<br />\ndepartment is that universities<br />\noften cannot keep their sports<br />\nheroes from dropping or<br />\nflunking out. This low<br />\ngraduation rate for athletes<br />\nworried the director of<br />\nlhletics at Marshall<br />\nlniversity in Huntington.<br />\nW.V. so much that he<br />\ninitiated a study to find out<br />\nwhere all his athletes were<br />\ngoing. The study was started,<br />\nJoseph McMUIlen explained,<br />\nbecause he was concerned<br />\nabout why so many<br />\nunderclass rather than<br />\nupperclass athletes were<br />\nplaying for Marshall teams.<br />\n\"Recruiting the athletes<br /><br />\nshouldn't only be looking at<br />\nhow fast he can run or how<br />\nhigh he can jump, but more<br />\nimportantly at how the<br />\nathlete can compete in an<br />\nacademic environment,\"McMullen said. \"The school<br />\nshould get competence from<br />\nthe athlete both in academics<br />\nand athletics.\"<br /><br />\ndetails in next issue<br /><br />\nshamefully unabashed cultural<br />\nelitist as myself cannot escape<br />\nthe gangling arms of the Pop<br />\nCulture. Through the Pop<br />\nCulture, movies, more so than<br />\nanything else, have insidiously<br />\ninfiltrated the American<br />\nconsciousness. There is a<br />\ncertain amount of unneeded<br />\nreference paid to movies that<br />\nhas elevated a mish-mosh<br />\nmedium to an esteemed art<br />\nform. Because of its technical<br />\nlimitations, specifically the<br />\nspatial distance between film<br />\nand audience, movies are<br />\nnothing more than enriched<br />\nentertainment sentenced to a<br />\nshallow artistic level. All<br />\nacross the country colleges<br />\nare offering highly<br />\nacademically-oriented courses<br />\non the art of film. These<br />\ncourses are merely studies in<br />\ntechnique rather than content<br />\n(for there is no content ot<br />\nstudy), much on the<br />\nintellectual level of a high<br />\nschool shop course.<br />\nMovie Mania<br />\nLast summer when \"Jaws\"<br />\nappeared, the American<br />\npublic was totally suckered<br />\nby this turkey of a movie.<br />\nPeople rushed to their local<br />\ntheatre as if their Messiah was<br />\nappearing live doing a<br />\nsoftshoe. Business at beaches<br />\ndropped drastically as the<br />\ngullible public feared for their<br />\nlives at the jaws of man-eating<br />\nSe/achii. There is something<br />\nwrong with a culture that acts<br />\nin such a spectactularly<br />\nimpulsive manner over just a<br />\nmovie. The Pop Culture has<br />\nmade movies an integral part<br />\nof everyday life. Movies are<br />\ncommonplace escapes from<br />\nthe harsh features of a harsh<br />\nreality.

The Coors flows<br />\nfast (at a buck a glass nothing<br />\nbut a rip-off) like a mountain<br />\nstream and then some foxy<br />\nChicks ask us all to hustle to<br />\nBruce Springsteen wailing<br />\nfrom \"Born to Run\". Finally,<br />\nwe all go back to their table<br />\nand sip some Boone's Farm<br />\nCountry Quencher while the<br />\nChicks coo sweet nothings to<br />\ntheir moot pet rocks.<br />\nThe preceding is, I trust,<br />\nnothing more than a recurring<br />\nnightmare that never fails to<br />\nsend the willies racing<br />\nthrough my body. What is so<br />\nfrightening is the possibility<br />\nthat someday it may all come<br />\ntrue, that I may be sucked by<br />\nuncontrollable forces into<br />\ntoday's Pop Culture.

However, the lack<br />\nof team experience proved<br />\ncostly as they dropped<br />\ndecisions to UMBC (44-10)<br />\nand to Washington College<br />\n(27-21).<br />\nThe new year saw the<br />\nlosing streak continue as<br />\nSusquehanna downed the<br />\nmen from Homewood.by the<br />\ncount of 33-12. However, the<br />\nJays broke into the win<br />\ncolumn with their next bout.<br />\nLed by freshman Muraji<br />\nNakazawa and sophomore<br />\ncaptain McLin Hawkins (a<br />\ntransfer student from West<br />\nPoint), Hopkinds thumped<br />\nCharles Street rival Loyola,<br />\n33-15. Loyola took an early<br />\nlead, but several consecutive<br />\nvictories in the late bouts<br />\nassured the Homewood<br />\nvictory.<br /><br />\nThis past Saturday, the<br />\nBlue Jays travelled to<br />\nLebanon Valley where they<br />\nparticipated in a quadrangular<br />\nmeet against three different<br />\ncolleges, including the host<br />\nschool.
