Such spirit is surely an answer to the<br />\nmistaken theory that spirit is wanting at Hopkins. The class teams last year were recognized<br />\nas one of the reasons for the successful lacrosse year. They.not only aroused interest, but<br />\ndeveloped material. Without interest and a well-trained scrub, a team is seriously handicapped. Let us hope that 1902's enthusiasm will be well repaid in the shape of another championship team in 1907!\"<br />\nTheir enthusiasm was repaid! But the class games, as one may see by their letter, satisfied the Team of 1902 as little as they did many men in the University. Their offer is generous<br />\nand we all thank them for their renewed interest and enthusiasm, and the best way to show<br />\nour gratitude is to get up a dandy series of class games\u2014and\u2014to be the championship team<br />\nof 1908!<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n1:- *;<br />\n4 Prtr '''''\u2022<br />\nilt,Nig gii-01.40:00( 22]<br />\n<br />\nt 1146<br />\n<br />\nlia.<br />\nP/0<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nN one of last year's issues of this paper the question, we believe, was<br />\nraised whether it would be. possible to have practice in the undergraduate department in conversational French and German. The<br />\nquestion came up a propos of Dr. Kiihnemann being the Turnbull<br />\nlecturer and the inability of so many students and Baltimoreans generally to understand his \"very delightful lectures.\" The NEWS-LETTER<br />\nthen \"respectfully requested the faculty to take into consideration\"<br />\nthe<br />\nplan of forming classes in conversation. A step has now been<br />\nV 141<br />\nmade<br />\nin the right direction. The Fellow in the French Department,<br />\n21:2;:k<br />\nMr. Stowell, is conducting two or three one-hour-a-Week courses in<br />\nFrench conversation. The classes are necessarily limited in size, and it is a pity that Mr.<br />\nStowell has not the time to instruct and please a larger number of men.<br />\n<br />\nV VZ,Pr.<br />\n,<br />\nF<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\n1:2;tri<br />\n4*..<br />\n<br />\nr 4!<br />\n<br />\nVVVVVVV:<br />\n<br />\n*.<br />\n*.<br />\n*<br />\nItiry!Auflus1414<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nOVIR,%<br />\n<br />\nwere glad to see lately a notice posted on the bulletin board of a<br />\nmeeting of the \"Hopkins' Night Committee.\" This is good news.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER has been asking for a Hopkins' Night repeatedly,<br />\nand at last we are going to have one. We only wish it could be<br />\narranged for \"The Red Mill.\" Were we a frivolous paper we would<br />\nsay, \"Don't miss seeing 'The Red Mill'\u2014Hopkins' Night or no<br />\nHopkins' Night!\" But as we are not a frivolous but an intensely<br />\nsober paper, we will say nothing at all about it. (See page nine.)<br />\n<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER announces with regret the resignation of Messrs. Hermann J.<br />\nHughes and Lawrence Melville Riddle from the Board of Editors. Mr. Hughes has made a<br />\nvery successful Business Manager and a very useful member of the Board. He will be greatly<br />\nmissed. Mr. Riddle, too, has done good work for the paper and we trust that after his enforced resignation, he will continue to show as much interest in the welfare of the paper as he<br />\nhas in the past.<br />\nOn account of these resignations several changes have been made in the positions of the<br />\nEditors. Mr. Pedrick, who has been a member of the Board since the Fall of 1906, becomes<br />\nAssistant Editor-in-Chief; and Mr. Corner, recently elected to the Board, becomes News-Editor.<br />\nWe announce with pleasure the election of Mr. J. Hamilton Owens and Mr. Alan C.<br />\nWoods as Assistant News-Editors of the NEWS-14iTTER.<br />\nBALTIMORE, Mn.,<br />\n<br />\nDecember 13, 1907.<br />\n<br />\nMR. SAMUEL C. CHEW, JR.,<br />\nEditor-in-Chief of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University:<br />\nDear Sir:\u2014Once again the time is here for the Undergraduates to get ready to be<br />\nrounded into shape so that the Johns Hopkins University may carry off the third successive<br />\nLacrosse Championship.<br />\nNow we know that there are many men who think it a hopeless task for a beginner to<br />\nmake the 'Varsity team the first year, and thus have not the necessary ambition to come out<br />\nand at least try for the same. They seem to forget that to make a place on the team at all, a<br />\nbeginning must be made some time. It is for these and others who have acquired a smattering<br />\nof the game at the prep schools that the inter-class games have been arranged. It was done<br />\nwith the hope that those who are not willing to work for a place on the first team and think it<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nought to go with their prep school certificate, may be induced to practice for these class teams,<br />\nand thus have the love for the games so instilled in them that they will aim higher and be<br />\nseized with a desire to work for the 'Varsity. For no doubt the doctrine of our day that \"a<br />\nman who will not work need not apply,\" still holds good with the team of today. Lacrosse<br />\nability with no sound effort behind it is of no use to a team, but only retards it.<br />\nTo be frank, the inter-class series of last Spring did not produce the results which had<br />\nbeen expected of them. This was due, in a large measure, to the fact that the Freshmen<br />\nthought the Juniors had a sure thing, and hence they did not deem it worth their while to<br />\npractice for the games. This element does not exist this year, as from all accounts the<br />\nmaterial in the two classes is so evenly matched that only the class putting forth the greater<br />\neffort will be able land the trophies.<br />\nSo, under the circumstances, the Lacrosse Team of 1902 believes that an inter-class<br />\nseries will be especially successful this season and again offers to donate twelve trophies to the<br />\nstudent body of the Johns Hopkins University, these to be presented to the players of the<br />\nteam carrying off the palm of victory in two out of a series of three lacrosse games to be played<br />\nbetween the Junior and Freshman Classes.<br />\nThe conditions governing the contest to be as follows:<br />\nFirst\u2014The parties to the contest shall be twelve players picked from the Junior Class on<br />\none<br />\nside; and twelve players picked from the Freshman and Sub-Freshman Classes on the<br />\nthe<br />\nother.<br />\nSecond\u2014The games may be played on any field the contesting classes may select.<br />\nThird\u2014The games are to be played, if possible, in March and up to the middle of April,<br />\nand on such dates as not to interfere with the practice of the University Lacrosse Team.<br />\nFourth\u2014Two out of three games must be played.<br />\nFifth\u2014Should any disputes arise between the two classes as to the eligibility of any<br />\nstudent, date and place of games, length of halves, officials, etc., it shall devolve upon a committee consisting of the Captain of the 'Varsity Lrcrosse Team, the Physical Director of the<br />\nUniversity and the President of the Board of Governors of the Athletic Association to pass on<br />\nsuch disputes. Whatever decision may be reached by this committee shall be final.<br />\nSi.x-th\u2014If it should so happen that two or more men should be called on to fill the same<br />\nposition, in the same or different games throughout the series, it shall devolve on the class<br />\norganization to select the player entitled to receive the prize.<br />\nWe suggest that the two classes appoint their respective captains at their earliest opportunity, so that these men may see to it that their candidates report to practice with the 'Varsity<br />\nsquad and thus raise the standard of the class teams.<br />\nIn conclusion, we beg to say that it pleases us to hear that the Baltimore City College<br />\nteam has passed successfully through a precarious season and starts in this year with spirit and<br />\nenthusiasm. This team should be given every assistance possible, and it seems to us that if<br />\nsome of our other lacrosse graduates, who have expressed themselves as desirous of giving the<br />\n'Varsity team a boost, would inaugurate an inter-class series at the City College, it would<br />\ngreatly improve and multiply our lacrosse material.<br />\nTrusting that you will give this matter your attention in the columns of the NEWSLETTER, and hoping to hear from you that the Undergraduates are ready to play a series of<br />\ngames under the conditions as suggested above, we remain;<br />\nYours respectfully,.<br />\nTHE LACROSSE TEAM OF 1902.<br />\nA.

The<br />\nthought of suicide began to haunt him and he<br />\nformed the habit of walking up and down the<br />\nquais from La Concorde to Auteuil, especially<br />\nthe less frequented ones, and sometimes he<br />\nwould go down close to the water and sit and<br />\nwatch it for hours. Having little or no moustache, a long nose and chin, he made one<br />\nthink instinctively of a despondent crane.<br />\nThree evenings in succession he made a trip<br />\nto the Pont d'Iena to inspect an iron ring<br />\nthat was driven high up into the wall near the<br />\nbridge for some commercial use or other, and<br />\nfinding it very much to his taste, he came<br />\nback the fourth evening determined to hang<br />\nhimself from it.<br />\nHaving gained the water's edge near his<br />\niron ring, he drew from his pocket, with a<br />\ncertain satisfaction, a soft curtain cord, artistically chosen for the occasion on account of its<br />\nred silk outside. Hardly had he begun to<br />\nmake a noose in it when a shadow moving<br />\nnearby attracted his attention, and no wonder,<br />\nfor a man had just hanged himself from de<br />\nGlidoir's chosen ring!<br />\nFurious with the anger of a man who finds<br />\nsomeone occupying his seat in a church or a<br />\ntheatre, he rushed forward and cut the rope<br />\nwithout supporting the man, who fell limply<br />\nto the ground with a thump. Athanase bent<br />\nover him and began untying the rope from his<br />\nneck, but without much gentleness, for the<br />\nman's head bumped up and down on the pavement. This manner of procedure seemed to<br />\nbe the proper one, for the stranger's eyes<br />\nopened and his lips moved as though he were<br />\ntrying to speak. He was conscious apparently<br />\nof all that was going on, but unable as yet to<br />\ntalk.<br />\nAthanase profited by the circumstance to<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nspeak his mind, so with much angry gesture<br />\nhe began:<br />\n\"Has no one any longer any respect for the<br />\nrights of others?, Would you be so kind as to<br />\ntell me what business you had to hang yourself from 'that particular ring? If you'd had<br />\nan ounce of manners, you'd have done it at<br />\nhome, but obviously, appearances don't bother<br />\nyou any more thaii other habits of gentlefolk.<br />\nSupposing a woman had come along this way,<br />\nor some children; a nice spectacle you'd have<br />\nmade dangling there in the dust (Athanase<br />\nwas growing poetic). You might at least have<br />\nhad the decency to put on a light-colored suit<br />\nlike mine, so they could see you; it would<br />\nhave been a sort of notice: 'Don't come this<br />\nway, I've just hanged myself!'\"<br />\nThe man began to show signs of ability to<br />\nreply, so de Glidoir hurried on so as to have<br />\nhis say out.<br />\n\"Any person with any taste \u2022 whatever<br />\nwould have jumped into the river, it's far less<br />\ntrouble and so much more private. The<br />\nostentation of this didn't bother you in the<br />\nleast though, you just went on and did it your<br />\nown way!\"<br />\nAthanase stood up so as to gain in a hurry,<br />\nif necessary, his chosen place. One never<br />\nknew what a spoil-sport like this would do.<br />\n\"What's your name?\" he asked the man<br />\nwhose lips were again moving.<br />\n\"Bagu.\"<br />\n\"Bagu!\" I'm not surprised! It's elegance<br />\nitself, just like you and your manners!\"<br />\nBagu, with his thin face and hungry eyes,<br />\nlooked like a workman who had been out of<br />\nemployment for a long time.<br />\n\"Why suicide, may I ask?\"<br />\n'Poverty!\"<br />\nAthanase de Glidoir raised his chin in the<br />\nair the least bit in the world:<br />\n\"Idiot!\" he said. \"Poverty's no reason for<br />\nkilling yourself; it's a reason for living, the<br />\nbest, the only reason! If you possess nothing<br />\nit's exactly as though you were just born,<br />\neverything is before you to desire, to conquer<br />\nand to take. Now the only logical reason for<br />\nsuicide is riches, because there's no cure for<br />\nit. A rich man is a sort of dead-alive person.<br />\nHe has no destination, nothing to desire,<br />\nnothing to discover. At least you have the<br />\nexcuse of loneliness.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhe jumped into bed, after turning the lamp<br />\ndown low and swallowing an opium pill.<br />\nUnfortunately his excitement w or ked<br />\nagainst the narcotic and so after half an hour<br />\nhe was wide enough awake to hear the door of<br />\nhis apartment open very softly.<br />\nInstantly his desire for death took unto itself wings, and he was seized with a love of<br />\nlife, so acute that his most insignificant possessions seemed dear past telling. He jumped<br />\nout of bed, and as Bagu got to the door of<br />\nthe room, creeping noiselessly along, he<br />\ncalled out to him:<br />\n\"Stop! It's I. You recognize me, don't<br />\nyou? I did think I'd like to die, and it was<br />\nawfully kind of you to fall in with my plan,<br />\nbut I've changed my mind. Get out!\"<br />\nBut Bagu turned up the lamp and advanced<br />\nimpeturbably. The absinthe drunk after a<br />\nlong fast, had taken effect, and he loomed up<br />\nsinister and formidable. His voice sounded<br />\nsolemn.<br />\n\"Oh! yes, I recognize you, but that's not<br />\ngoing to prevent my knifing you.\"<br />\n\"What!\" cried de Glidoir, backing to the<br />\nbed, \"but I don't want you to!\"<br />\n\"As if that made any difference,\" chuckled<br />\nBagu. \"Murderers don't usually consult<br />\ntheir\u2014their clients.\"<br />\nHe moved a chair quietly to the bed, like a<br />\nmethodical operator, and taking the knife<br />\nfrom his pocket he opened it without hurry.<br />\nDe Glidoir shrivelled up in the bed-clothes.<br />\nGibbering with fear he managed to stammer<br />\nout:<br />\n\"Very well, I'll allow you to steal a little<br />\n\u2014not much, you understand!\"<br />\n\"I prefer to stick you first,\" said Bagu in<br />\nan even voice, \"because otherwise you might<br />\nwing me with your gun or call for help\u2014\"<br />\nAthanase's eyes were starting from his head<br />\nand his teeth rattled like dice.<br />\n\"You'll never be able to find :the money\u2014<br />\nhere, let me.get up\u2014\"<br />\n\"Oh! don't bother; I've got all the time<br />\nthere is. I can hunt for it all night if<br />\nnecessary.\"<br />\nThe knife was ready, wide open.<br />\n\"But reflect what a ghastly crime you are<br />\nWhile Bagu was making his way on foot.<br />\nAthenase took a cab and quickly covered the about to commit.\" cried de Glidoir in agony.<br />\ndistance. Arrived home, he left his key on<br />\nBagu looked at him severely, turning the<br />\nthe outside of the door and undressing quickly knife blade back and forth on his arm. Then<br />\n<br />\n\"I have two children.\"<br />\n\"Mercy on us! What next? I've a good<br />\nnotion to hang you up again with my own<br />\nhands! Why this is worse than mere stupidity,<br />\nit's a criminal monstrosity, your committing<br />\nsuicide. Don't you know you belong to your<br />\nchildren, and it's your duty to struggle for<br />\nthem in every way imaginable?\"<br />\nDe Glidoir pronounced these last words with<br />\nthe air of one inspired. He had given up all<br />\nidea of hanging himself now, possibly from<br />\nthe fear that he might look like Bagu when it<br />\nwas done, but a sudden inspiration had come<br />\nto him\u2014he would commit suicide by means of<br />\nBagu<br />\nThis was a happy thought, and quite satisfied his desire for a dramatic exit, and along<br />\nwith it he could do a stroke of charity. Yes,<br />\nindeed, it was a good idea all around.<br />\nHe helped the man to his feet, and taking<br />\nhold of his arm he walked him along slowly,<br />\ngiving him a little shake every now and then<br />\nto complete his resuscitation, talking to him<br />\npersuasively all the time.<br />\n\"You go to the Rue de Prony, number 208.<br />\nOn the ground floor to the right, a man, lives<br />\nwho goes to bed every night at nine o'clock,<br />\ndead drunk, with his door-key on the outside.<br />\nHe's rich and you can make a fine haul there,<br />\nbut I'd begin by cutting his throat if I were<br />\nyou, because he's a low blackguard with no<br />\nsympathy for the poor, and besides, he always<br />\nkeeps a revolver under his pillow and he's had<br />\nalarms put on all his drawers.\"<br />\nThey were just passing a cutler's shop, so<br />\nAthanase went in and bought him a fine clasp<br />\nknife.<br />\n\"Put that in your pocket,\" he said to Bagu,<br />\nwho obeyed him with the impassive stare<br />\nof a sleep-walker.<br />\n\"Let's go to a cafe.\"<br />\nAthenase poured absinthe and seltzer into<br />\nthe man until you'd have thought he'd burst.<br />\n\"Now, there you are,\" he said, leaving<br />\nhim, \"you'd best go directly. Remember<br />\nyour poor children, and do not hesitate!\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nwith the tone of authority of a superior person,<br />\nspeaking to some ignorant insignificant, he<br />\nsaid:<br />\n\"Monsieur, I possess nothing, it's with me<br />\nexactly as though I had just been born, everything is before me,\u2014to desire, to conquer and<br />\nto taste\u2014\"<br />\nDe Glidoir gave a hideous grimace which he<br />\nfondly believe to be a smile.<br />\n\"Come, come, Bagu, I'm a good sort of a<br />\nchap\u2014\"<br />\n\"You? Why, you're a low blackguard with<br />\nno sympathy for the poor!\"<br />\n\"Well, then, take my gold watch. Will<br />\nthat satisfy you? It's there on the chimneypiece.\"<br />\nWith his armed hand Bagu made a dignified<br />\ngesture.<br />\n\"I have children,\" he said. \"I belong to<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nDe Glidoir began to sob.<br />\n\"I cut you down when you'd hanged yourself, and saved your life! Was ever such ingratitude!\"<br />\nThe same gesture of offended dignity from<br />\nBagu.<br />\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"I am convinced that<br />\nI am doing you a service: being rich, you are<br />\na sort of dead-alive person with no destination,<br />\nnothing to desire, nothing to discover\u2014Don't<br />\ntake on so. I won't hurt you much. I know<br />\nhow to do it, because I've cut ducks' throats<br />\nfor years.\"<br />\nSo saying, Bagu again passed and repassed<br />\nthe blade over his arm to give it a final edge,<br />\nand then stood up.<br />\n<br />\nAthancase, wild with terror and scarcely<br />\nknowing what he was doing, cried out in a<br />\nloud voice as though it were absolutely necessary for him to know before he died:<br />\n\"And\u2014your children\u2014are they girls or<br />\nboys!\"<br />\nBagu stopped sharpening the knife, but he<br />\nturned up his sleeve in a business-like way:<br />\n\"Two girls: Marie and Je'anne.\"<br />\nAthanase, with an idiotic bleat, went on:<br />\n\"Ah, that's much better than boys!\"<br />\n\"Ye, much better,\" answered Bagu distantly, rubbing his thumb along the edge of<br />\nthe blade.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n\"I'm so fond of children,\" brayed de<br />\nGlidoir, squinting at the knife as though his<br />\nvisitor were about to dispatch a brace of<br />\ncherubim for,his consumption.<br />\nBagu shrngged his shoulders approvingly.<br />\n'I have their pictures somewhere,' he said.<br />\n\"I brought them with me to kiss them farewell.\"<br />\n\"Oh! do let me see them!\" begged de<br />\nGlidoir.<br />\n\"There,\" said Bagu, taking a small photograph from an inside pocket.<br />\nAthanase seized on it and giving an absurdly forced laugh, cried;<br />\n\"Ah! You said Marie and Jeanne, didn't<br />\nyou? This must be Marie, the elder. She's<br />\npretty, but Jeanne, she looks like a sly little<br />\npiece!\"<br />\n\"She is that!\" replied Bagu, beginning to<br />\nbe interested, \"you can ask anyone in the<br />\nneighborhood.\"<br />\n\"I simply can't take my eyes off them!\"<br />\ncried de Glidoir, \"they're just the kind of<br />\nchildren I adore!\"<br />\nBagu gave a deprecating smile and began<br />\nagain to strop the knife, this time on his<br />\nthigh. The gentleman's demonstrations<br />\nseemed perfectly natural to him.<br />\n\"Could you possibly give me this photograph?\" asked de Glidoir, with the avidity of<br />\na lover.<br />\nBagu's smile broadened. He was rather<br />\ntickled at the idea. \"Proud Papa,\" that sort<br />\nof thing. Instantly, though, his expression<br />\nchanged as though the smile had been stopped<br />\nby a ratchet. He stood with his mouth open<br />\nlike one hypnotized by some terrible, unheard<br />\nof difficulty. He looked first at the knife and<br />\nthen at Athanase; one could'nt give photographs to a dead man.<br />\n\"I'd like, to,\" he said in an embarassed<br />\ntone, \"but\u2014,\" and he stopped, confused by<br />\nthe dilemma between which he was caught.<br />\n\"Oh, come now,\" said de Glidoir, understanding the situation perfectly. He did not<br />\noffer to solve the problem, however, but<br />\nstudied the picture minutely.<br />\n\"I've never seen such interesting children's<br />\nfaces,\" he went on. `Ah! little Marie\u2014and<br />\nJeanne\u2014really, it,s awfully hard to decide<br />\nwhich\u2014they're both so\u2014!\"<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHe pronounced the words with the deepest<br />\ninterest and respect. Bagu stood smiling,<br />\npleased and paternal. Then he again grew<br />\ngrave. What was he to do? He was caught<br />\nin a tight place between the poignard and the<br />\nportrait. He gave another smile:<br />\n\"No, Monsieur, you have never seen two<br />\nsuch little beauties,\"<br />\nAgain, he busied himself with the knife.<br />\nWhatever was he to do? It was a simple<br />\nmatter enough to kill this gentleman and<br />\nmake away with everything he had of any<br />\nvalue, but on the other hand, it seemed a<br />\npity to cut the throat of anyone who had such<br />\nobviously good taste.<br />\nFinally vanity came out the stronger. He<br />\ncould not do away with such a keen<br />\nappreciator of his children's beauty.<br />\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"you may keep the<br />\npicture.\"<br />\nHe closed the knife, put it in his hip pocket<br />\nand got up with the air of a casual visitor<br />\ntaking his leave.<br />\n\"Ah!\" said de Glidoir, embarassed apparently at accepting the gift, \"I really hardly<br />\nlike to deprive you\u2014\"<br />\n\"Oh! don't mention it, don't mention it,\"<br />\nsaid Bagu with a wave of his hand.<br />\nAnd in order to cut short these formalities,<br />\nhe walked toward the door. His role of<br />\nfather of the two charming daughters made<br />\nhim the equal of this admiring gentleman<br />\nand compelled him to noble manners.<br />\nHe had forgotten the possibilty of taking<br />\nanything of the least value. His poverty was<br />\nforgotten and every reality became negligible.<br />\nHe was enriched to infinity by paternal<br />\nvanity.<br />\nHe went out, his bosom sweling with pride,<br />\nmaking the same gesture of a gentleman<br />\ndeprecating a trifling service done for another.<br />\nSome people passing, were rather astonished<br />\nat the grand manner with which he said:<br />\n\"Not at all! not at all!\" as he closed the<br />\ndoor.<br />\nA lot is heard 'bout Presidents,<br />\nThe party's love for Taft;<br />\nWe wonder if this match will bring<br />\nTo both an Eppie-Taft.<br />\n<br />\nTHE POST-GRAD, THE GIRL AND THE<br />\nFOOTBALL GAME.<br />\nThis \"contribution\" (of which genus the smallest<br />\nis most gratefully, etc.,) was submitted with the<br />\nfollowing note:<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LliTTER:<br />\nDear Sir:\u2014This is a contribution from one who<br />\nis very much interested in the NUN/vs-LATTER\u2014an<br />\nM. M. G.<br />\nUndergrad, not a Post-Grad.<br />\n<br />\nWhirr-bang! The door-bell had hardly<br />\nstopped ringing when the staid old butler<br />\nthrew open the door and in walked the flurried<br />\nand anxious Post-Grad. Staggered by the<br />\nshining silver card tray, he lunged into his<br />\npocket with a desperate gasp in search of the<br />\nelusive pasteboard. Where on earth was it?<br />\nWhat made the butler smile in that supercilious way? Why, he had had the card as he<br />\ncame up the steps, and now\u2014and now\u2014good<br />\ngracious!\u2014it was in his left hand! The supercilious smile broadened into an open grin,as the<br />\ndignified white shirt front bowed him into the<br />\nparlor. He stepped gingerly over the slippery<br />\nfloor, glancing hopelessly at the spindlelegged gilt chairs and remained standing in<br />\nthe middle of the floor. A deliciously dainty<br />\nrustle of silk, the clicking of tiny French<br />\nheels on the stair\u2014there she stood in the<br />\ndoorway, a vision of fur and feathers, her<br />\nlong, dark cloak in marked contrast with her<br />\ndelicate pink cheeks.<br />\nThe Post-Grad took three hasty steps, but<br />\nalas!\u2014that slippery floor! The table\u2014the<br />\nchair\u2014what COULD he grasp? What\u2014but<br />\nnow it was too late\u2014his heels slipped, and the<br />\ndignified student of philosophy sprawled in a<br />\nhelpless tangle with the slender legs of the<br />\ngilded chair.<br />\nAt last he arose to his feet and, blushing<br />\nfuriously, stammered: 'Er\u2014ah\u2014isn't it a<br />\nnice day for the game?\" The girl, sweetly<br />\nignoring the mishap, but inwardly choking<br />\nwith laughter, led the way to the door, and<br />\ntogether they walked down the steps and<br />\nsilently hurried to the car.<br />\n\"We must be exceedingly early,\" the PostGrad remarked, as they took their seats.<br />\n\"Yes,\" said the girl, \"nobody seems to be<br />\ngoing to the game.

G.<br />\n<br />\nEXTRA.<br />\nSince writing of editorial on page three, we<br />\nhave learned that there will be a Hopkins<br />\nNight, on Tuesday, January 21st, at the<br />\nAcademy to see \"The Waltz Dream,\" by<br />\nOscar Straus. Be sure to come.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nATHLETIC NOTES.<br />\nAgain has the Lacrosse Team of 1902 come<br />\nto the fore and offered to the Junior and Freshman Classes a set of individual trophies to be<br />\ncontested for by lacrosse teams from those<br />\nclasses. This is the third year that these<br />\ntrophies have been offered, and they have been<br />\nproductive of some excellent games. Last<br />\nyear the contests were not so interesting as the<br />\nyear before, when the present Senior Class,<br />\nthen Freshmen, took the class of 1907 into<br />\ncamp in the two games played.<br />\nThe generosity and spirit of the men who<br />\ncompose the team of 1902 is certainly to be<br />\ncommended, and it is to be hoped that the<br />\nclasses this year will show the proper appreciation of such a generous gift. It is a good<br />\nshowing for the spirit among our alumni,<br />\nwhen, in addition to contributions toward an<br />\nathletic field, they can subscribe to foster the<br />\nlacrosse spirit at the University. The NEWSLETTER takes great pleasure in thanking the<br />\n1902 team for their exceedingly kind offer on<br />\nbehalf of the students of the University.<br />\nThe Director of the Gymnasium has undertaken a worthy project, and one in which all<br />\nthe fellows should heartily co-operate. The<br />\nscheme is to supply those who use the shower<br />\nbaths with clean towels whenever wanted, at<br />\na cost price. He has gotten an appropriation<br />\nfrom the Board of Trustees, and with it will<br />\npurchase 1,000 bath towels. Now the plan is<br />\nthis: Each fellow who wants a towel is to<br />\nsign a card and pay a dollar. He may either<br />\npay a dollar in advance, or it may be taken off<br />\nhis caution money at the end of the year: that<br />\npoint has not been settled as yet. By paying<br />\nthis dollar, he is entitled to a clean towel<br />\nwhenever he may wish it. This privilege will<br />\ncontinue from now until the University<br />\ncloses. This is an excellent plan, and will<br />\ndo away with lots of trouble. Instead of<br />\nhaving to bring towels from home, or rent<br />\nthem from \"Jim,\" a man may have a clean<br />\ntowel whenever he wishes, at the low cost of<br />\none dollar for five months. This one dollar<br />\nrepresents the cost of laundering. Now, in<br />\norder to make this scheme work, there must be<br />\na big crowd in it. There must be at least 100<br />\nbathers sign up for the towels. If the plan<br />\nworks, and it certainly ought if the students<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ngive it the proper backing, Dr. Abercrombie<br />\nis to be congratulated, for he will have supplied a long-felt want, and added one more<br />\ncomfort to the locker room.<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE TEAM.<br />\nThe lacrosse season is in full blast, and<br />\nsoon you will see the usual number of swollen<br />\nfingers, and cut heads as a result of practising<br />\nin the cage. The prospects for a winning<br />\nteam are good, but there are several positions<br />\nyet to be filled. From time to time the daily<br />\nnewspapers have come out with fore-casts of<br />\nwhat the line-up will be. To the candidates<br />\nlet this be said: Pay no attention to what the<br />\npapers say, for they are usually far from<br />\nright, particularly with regard to Hopkins<br />\nteams. There is some time yet before the<br />\nfirst game, and surprises are likely to happen<br />\nat any time. Sometimes fellows do not make<br />\nthe team until the last game, so keep your<br />\nnerve with you. Remember the class teams.<br />\nIf you play on the winning class team, you<br />\nwill get a fine gold medal. Juniors, you have<br />\nnot won at lacrosse as yet, and you can't<br />\nafford to be beaten by the Freshmen. Freshmen, you were beaten in football, now get<br />\nbusy and retrieve yourselves by licking the<br />\nJuniors in lacrosse. It has been done before,<br />\nand can be done again.<br />\nThis year the Lacrosse League, in addition<br />\nto giving a trophy to the winning team, will<br />\ngive individual trophies to the players on<br />\nchampionship teams. Hopkins must win the<br />\nchampionship, and everybody must do his<br />\nbest to land that coveted title. Let us see if<br />\nthe team of 1908 can't be the one to make it<br />\nthree championships straight.<br />\n<br />\nCOTILLON CLUB.<br />\nThe time for the next Cotillon Club Dance<br />\nis almost here, and there are many subscribers<br />\nwho have not yet paid anything on their dues,<br />\nnot even for the first dance. This state of<br />\naffairs is positively disgraceful. How do you<br />\nexpect us to give these dances in the proper<br />\nstyle? You do not seem to realize that it<br />\ntakes ready money to run these dances, and<br />\nunless one hundred dollars more is paid up it<br />\n<br />\nwill be impossible to give the other two<br />\ndances. The Board .of Governors is working<br />\nas hard as it possibly can to collect the money,<br />\nbut it met with very little success before the<br />\nChristmas Holidays. Let us hope that it will<br />\nbe more successful in the New Year. Everyone before Christmas was crying hard times,<br />\nbut now that it is past and everyone received<br />\nlots of money at Christmas, there is no excuse<br />\nfor not paying.<br />\nThe Cotillon Club Dances are not supported<br />\nby the students as well as they should be. It<br />\nused to be that everyone was anxious to<br />\nattend the Cotillons, and did not have to be<br />\nbegged to come. When one remembers that<br />\nthe Cotillon Club Dances\u2014and there are only<br />\nthree during the year\u2014are the only social<br />\nactivity at Hopkins, one ought to feel ashamed<br />\nto think that the students have to be beseached<br />\nand implored to subscribe to the dances, and<br />\neven then enough subscriptions can not be<br />\nraised to insure the success of the dances.<br />\nThe three upper classes are well represented<br />\nmore or less, but the Freshmen did not make<br />\nas good a showing as was expected of them.<br />\nFreshmen, it is no excuse to say that you are<br />\ntoo busy, or have too much work, for both of<br />\nthe remaining dances are on Friday nights.<br />\nAnother point is that we will not have the<br />\ntone of these dances lowered. All the gentlemen are requested to wear either tuxedos or<br />\nfull dress. We think that only a word on<br />\nthis subject will be sufficient.<br />\nWe should like to take this opportunity to<br />\nremark upon the lack of interest which is<br />\nshown by the chaperons in the dances. There<br />\nis always a list of about twenty-five chaperons<br />\non the programs, but usually there are present<br />\nonly about three or at the most five. These<br />\nare generally the same ones and we take<br />\ngreat pleasure in extending to them our<br />\nheartiest thanks, and hope that they will continue to take interest in the dances. What a<br />\ndreadful plight we should be in, if the few<br />\nfaithful ones should ever desert us!<br />\n<br />\nA Prof. whose only Reliance,<br />\nWas placed on the subject of Science,<br />\nWas married last year;<br />\nNow the baby is here,<br />\nAnd papa now works for his Viands.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHOWARD STREET.<br />\nAs I was walking down Howard street<br />\nthe other morning, with considerable<br />\nrapidity,<br />\nI met a drunken man,<br />\nWho approached me in that peculiar<br />\nstaggering manner, affected by drunken<br />\nmen, and said:<br />\n\"Please tell me, if you can,<br />\n<br />\nILGENFRITZ STUDIO<br />\nSuccessor to CUMMINS<br />\n<br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY<br />\n20 West Lexington Street<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nSpecial Discount to Students<br />\n<br />\n\"The Men's Store.\"<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLER.

Such spirit is surely an answer to the<br />\nmistaken theory that spirit is wanting at Hopkins. The class teams last year were recognized<br />\nas one of the reasons for the successful lacrosse year. They.not only aroused interest, but<br />\ndeveloped material. Without interest and a well-trained scrub, a team is seriously handicapped. Let us hope that 1902's enthusiasm will be well repaid in the shape of another championship team in 1907!\"<br />\nTheir enthusiasm was repaid! But the class games, as one may see by their letter, satisfied the Team of 1902 as little as they did many men in the University. Their offer is generous<br />\nand we all thank them for their renewed interest and enthusiasm, and the best way to show<br />\nour gratitude is to get up a dandy series of class games\u2014and\u2014to be the championship team<br />\nof 1908!<br /><br />\n'<br />\n1:- *;<br />\n4 Prtr '''''\u2022<br />\nilt,Nig gii-01.40:00( 22]<br /><br />\nt 1146<br /><br />\nlia.<br />\nP/0<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nN one of last year's issues of this paper the question, we believe, was<br />\nraised whether it would be. possible to have practice in the undergraduate department in conversational French and German. The<br />\nquestion came up a propos of Dr. Kiihnemann being the Turnbull<br />\nlecturer and the inability of so many students and Baltimoreans generally to understand his \"very delightful lectures.\" The NEWS-LETTER<br />\nthen \"respectfully requested the faculty to take into consideration\"<br />\nthe<br />\nplan of forming classes in conversation. A step has now been<br />\nV 141<br />\nmade<br />\nin the right direction. The Fellow in the French Department,<br />\n21:2;:k<br />\nMr. Stowell, is conducting two or three one-hour-a-Week courses in<br />\nFrench conversation. The classes are necessarily limited in size, and it is a pity that Mr.<br />\nStowell has not the time to instruct and please a larger number of men.<br /><br />\nV VZ,Pr.<br />\n,<br />\nF<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\n1:2;tri<br />\n4*..<br /><br />\nr 4!<br /><br />\nVVVVVVV:<br /><br />\n*.<br />\n*.<br />\n*<br />\nItiry!Auflus1414<br />\n1<br /><br />\nOVIR,%<br /><br />\nwere glad to see lately a notice posted on the bulletin board of a<br />\nmeeting of the \"Hopkins' Night Committee.\" This is good news.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER has been asking for a Hopkins' Night repeatedly,<br />\nand at last we are going to have one. We only wish it could be<br />\narranged for \"The Red Mill.\" Were we a frivolous paper we would<br />\nsay, \"Don't miss seeing 'The Red Mill'\u2014Hopkins' Night or no<br />\nHopkins' Night!\" But as we are not a frivolous but an intensely<br />\nsober paper, we will say nothing at all about it. (See page nine.)<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER announces with regret the resignation of Messrs. Hermann J.<br />\nHughes and Lawrence Melville Riddle from the Board of Editors. Mr. Hughes has made a<br />\nvery successful Business Manager and a very useful member of the Board. He will be greatly<br />\nmissed. Mr. Riddle, too, has done good work for the paper and we trust that after his enforced resignation, he will continue to show as much interest in the welfare of the paper as he<br />\nhas in the past.<br />\nOn account of these resignations several changes have been made in the positions of the<br />\nEditors. Mr. Pedrick, who has been a member of the Board since the Fall of 1906, becomes<br />\nAssistant Editor-in-Chief; and Mr. Corner, recently elected to the Board, becomes News-Editor.<br />\nWe announce with pleasure the election of Mr. J.

They seem to forget that to make a place on the team at all, a<br />\nbeginning must be made some time. It is for these and others who have acquired a smattering<br />\nof the game at the prep schools that the inter-class games have been arranged. It was done<br />\nwith the hope that those who are not willing to work for a place on the first team and think it<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nought to go with their prep school certificate, may be induced to practice for these class teams,<br />\nand thus have the love for the games so instilled in them that they will aim higher and be<br />\nseized with a desire to work for the 'Varsity. For no doubt the doctrine of our day that \"a<br />\nman who will not work need not apply,\" still holds good with the team of today. Lacrosse<br />\nability with no sound effort behind it is of no use to a team, but only retards it.<br />\nTo be frank, the inter-class series of last Spring did not produce the results which had<br />\nbeen expected of them. This was due, in a large measure, to the fact that the Freshmen<br />\nthought the Juniors had a sure thing, and hence they did not deem it worth their while to<br />\npractice for the games. This element does not exist this year, as from all accounts the<br />\nmaterial in the two classes is so evenly matched that only the class putting forth the greater<br />\neffort will be able land the trophies.<br />\nSo, under the circumstances, the Lacrosse Team of 1902 believes that an inter-class<br />\nseries will be especially successful this season and again offers to donate twelve trophies to the<br />\nstudent body of the Johns Hopkins University, these to be presented to the players of the<br />\nteam carrying off the palm of victory in two out of a series of three lacrosse games to be played<br />\nbetween the Junior and Freshman Classes.<br />\nThe conditions governing the contest to be as follows:<br />\nFirst\u2014The parties to the contest shall be twelve players picked from the Junior Class on<br />\none<br />\nside; and twelve players picked from the Freshman and Sub-Freshman Classes on the<br />\nthe<br />\nother.<br />\nSecond\u2014The games may be played on any field the contesting classes may select.<br />\nThird\u2014The games are to be played, if possible, in March and up to the middle of April,<br />\nand on such dates as not to interfere with the practice of the University Lacrosse Team.<br />\nFourth\u2014Two out of three games must be played.<br />\nFifth\u2014Should any disputes arise between the two classes as to the eligibility of any<br />\nstudent, date and place of games, length of halves, officials, etc., it shall devolve upon a committee consisting of the Captain of the 'Varsity Lrcrosse Team, the Physical Director of the<br />\nUniversity and the President of the Board of Governors of the Athletic Association to pass on<br />\nsuch disputes. Whatever decision may be reached by this committee shall be final.<br />\nSi.x-th\u2014If it should so happen that two or more men should be called on to fill the same<br />\nposition, in the same or different games throughout the series, it shall devolve on the class<br />\norganization to select the player entitled to receive the prize.<br />\nWe suggest that the two classes appoint their respective captains at their earliest opportunity, so that these men may see to it that their candidates report to practice with the 'Varsity<br />\nsquad and thus raise the standard of the class teams.<br />\nIn conclusion, we beg to say that it pleases us to hear that the Baltimore City College<br />\nteam has passed successfully through a precarious season and starts in this year with spirit and<br />\nenthusiasm. This team should be given every assistance possible, and it seems to us that if<br />\nsome of our other lacrosse graduates, who have expressed themselves as desirous of giving the<br />\n'Varsity team a boost, would inaugurate an inter-class series at the City College, it would<br />\ngreatly improve and multiply our lacrosse material.<br />\nTrusting that you will give this matter your attention in the columns of the NEWSLETTER, and hoping to hear from you that the Undergraduates are ready to play a series of<br />\ngames under the conditions as suggested above, we remain;<br />\nYours respectfully,.<br />\nTHE LACROSSE TEAM OF 1902.<br />\nA.

STRAITH BRISCOE, Baltimore.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nPERSONAL VANITY.<br />\nFrom the French of Leon Frapie<br />\nBy<br /><br />\nJOHN<br /><br />\nALAN<br /><br />\nHAMMON.<br /><br />\nAt the age of thirty-six, Athanase de<br />\nGlidoir, without family and without love<br />\naffairs of any serious kind, became frightfully<br />\nhypochondriac for no other reason in the<br />\nworld than because he had nothing to occupy<br />\nhis mind.<br />\nTall and thin and dressed with a sort of<br />\nrectilinear elegance, his fixed maniacal stare<br />\ngave him a most unusual appearance. The<br />\nthought of suicide began to haunt him and he<br />\nformed the habit of walking up and down the<br />\nquais from La Concorde to Auteuil, especially<br />\nthe less frequented ones, and sometimes he<br />\nwould go down close to the water and sit and<br />\nwatch it for hours. Having little or no moustache, a long nose and chin, he made one<br />\nthink instinctively of a despondent crane.<br />\nThree evenings in succession he made a trip<br />\nto the Pont d'Iena to inspect an iron ring<br />\nthat was driven high up into the wall near the<br />\nbridge for some commercial use or other, and<br />\nfinding it very much to his taste, he came<br />\nback the fourth evening determined to hang<br />\nhimself from it.<br />\nHaving gained the water's edge near his<br />\niron ring, he drew from his pocket, with a<br />\ncertain satisfaction, a soft curtain cord, artistically chosen for the occasion on account of its<br />\nred silk outside. Hardly had he begun to<br />\nmake a noose in it when a shadow moving<br />\nnearby attracted his attention, and no wonder,<br />\nfor a man had just hanged himself from de<br />\nGlidoir's chosen ring!<br />\nFurious with the anger of a man who finds<br />\nsomeone occupying his seat in a church or a<br />\ntheatre, he rushed forward and cut the rope<br />\nwithout supporting the man, who fell limply<br />\nto the ground with a thump. Athanase bent<br />\nover him and began untying the rope from his<br />\nneck, but without much gentleness, for the<br />\nman's head bumped up and down on the pavement. This manner of procedure seemed to<br />\nbe the proper one, for the stranger's eyes<br />\nopened and his lips moved as though he were<br />\ntrying to speak. He was conscious apparently<br />\nof all that was going on, but unable as yet to<br />\ntalk.<br />\nAthanase profited by the circumstance to<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nspeak his mind, so with much angry gesture<br />\nhe began:<br />\n\"Has no one any longer any respect for the<br />\nrights of others?, Would you be so kind as to<br />\ntell me what business you had to hang yourself from 'that particular ring? If you'd had<br />\nan ounce of manners, you'd have done it at<br />\nhome, but obviously, appearances don't bother<br />\nyou any more thaii other habits of gentlefolk.<br />\nSupposing a woman had come along this way,<br />\nor some children; a nice spectacle you'd have<br />\nmade dangling there in the dust (Athanase<br />\nwas growing poetic). You might at least have<br />\nhad the decency to put on a light-colored suit<br />\nlike mine, so they could see you; it would<br />\nhave been a sort of notice: 'Don't come this<br />\nway, I've just hanged myself!'\"<br />\nThe man began to show signs of ability to<br />\nreply, so de Glidoir hurried on so as to have<br />\nhis say out.<br />\n\"Any person with any taste \u2022 whatever<br />\nwould have jumped into the river, it's far less<br />\ntrouble and so much more private. The<br />\nostentation of this didn't bother you in the<br />\nleast though, you just went on and did it your<br />\nown way!\"<br />\nAthanase stood up so as to gain in a hurry,<br />\nif necessary, his chosen place. One never<br />\nknew what a spoil-sport like this would do.<br />\n\"What's your name?\" he asked the man<br />\nwhose lips were again moving.<br />\n\"Bagu.\"<br />\n\"Bagu!\" I'm not surprised! It's elegance<br />\nitself, just like you and your manners!\"<br />\nBagu, with his thin face and hungry eyes,<br />\nlooked like a workman who had been out of<br />\nemployment for a long time.<br />\n\"Why suicide, may I ask?\"<br />\n'Poverty!\"<br />\nAthanase de Glidoir raised his chin in the<br />\nair the least bit in the world:<br />\n\"Idiot!\" he said. \"Poverty's no reason for<br />\nkilling yourself; it's a reason for living, the<br />\nbest, the only reason! If you possess nothing<br />\nit's exactly as though you were just born,<br />\neverything is before you to desire, to conquer<br />\nand to take. Now the only logical reason for<br />\nsuicide is riches, because there's no cure for<br />\nit. A rich man is a sort of dead-alive person.<br />\nHe has no destination, nothing to desire,<br />\nnothing to discover. At least you have the<br />\nexcuse of loneliness.\"<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nhe jumped into bed, after turning the lamp<br />\ndown low and swallowing an opium pill.<br />\nUnfortunately his excitement w or ked<br />\nagainst the narcotic and so after half an hour<br />\nhe was wide enough awake to hear the door of<br />\nhis apartment open very softly.<br />\nInstantly his desire for death took unto itself wings, and he was seized with a love of<br />\nlife, so acute that his most insignificant possessions seemed dear past telling. He jumped<br />\nout of bed, and as Bagu got to the door of<br />\nthe room, creeping noiselessly along, he<br />\ncalled out to him:<br />\n\"Stop! It's I. You recognize me, don't<br />\nyou? I did think I'd like to die, and it was<br />\nawfully kind of you to fall in with my plan,<br />\nbut I've changed my mind. Get out!\"<br />\nBut Bagu turned up the lamp and advanced<br />\nimpeturbably. The absinthe drunk after a<br />\nlong fast, had taken effect, and he loomed up<br />\nsinister and formidable. His voice sounded<br />\nsolemn.<br />\n\"Oh! yes, I recognize you, but that's not<br />\ngoing to prevent my knifing you.\"<br />\n\"What!\" cried de Glidoir, backing to the<br />\nbed, \"but I don't want you to!\"<br />\n\"As if that made any difference,\" chuckled<br />\nBagu. \"Murderers don't usually consult<br />\ntheir\u2014their clients.\"<br />\nHe moved a chair quietly to the bed, like a<br />\nmethodical operator, and taking the knife<br />\nfrom his pocket he opened it without hurry.<br />\nDe Glidoir shrivelled up in the bed-clothes.<br />\nGibbering with fear he managed to stammer<br />\nout:<br />\n\"Very well, I'll allow you to steal a little<br />\n\u2014not much, you understand!\"<br />\n\"I prefer to stick you first,\" said Bagu in<br />\nan even voice, \"because otherwise you might<br />\nwing me with your gun or call for help\u2014\"<br />\nAthanase's eyes were starting from his head<br />\nand his teeth rattled like dice.<br />\n\"You'll never be able to find :the money\u2014<br />\nhere, let me.get up\u2014\"<br />\n\"Oh! don't bother; I've got all the time<br />\nthere is. I can hunt for it all night if<br />\nnecessary.\"<br />\nThe knife was ready, wide open.<br />\n\"But reflect what a ghastly crime you are<br />\nWhile Bagu was making his way on foot.<br />\nAthenase took a cab and quickly covered the about to commit.\" cried de Glidoir in agony.<br />\ndistance. Arrived home, he left his key on<br />\nBagu looked at him severely, turning the<br />\nthe outside of the door and undressing quickly knife blade back and forth on his arm. Then<br /><br />\n\"I have two children.\"<br />\n\"Mercy on us! What next? I've a good<br />\nnotion to hang you up again with my own<br />\nhands! Why this is worse than mere stupidity,<br />\nit's a criminal monstrosity, your committing<br />\nsuicide. Don't you know you belong to your<br />\nchildren, and it's your duty to struggle for<br />\nthem in every way imaginable?\"<br />\nDe Glidoir pronounced these last words with<br />\nthe air of one inspired. He had given up all<br />\nidea of hanging himself now, possibly from<br />\nthe fear that he might look like Bagu when it<br />\nwas done, but a sudden inspiration had come<br />\nto him\u2014he would commit suicide by means of<br />\nBagu<br />\nThis was a happy thought, and quite satisfied his desire for a dramatic exit, and along<br />\nwith it he could do a stroke of charity. Yes,<br />\nindeed, it was a good idea all around.<br />\nHe helped the man to his feet, and taking<br />\nhold of his arm he walked him along slowly,<br />\ngiving him a little shake every now and then<br />\nto complete his resuscitation, talking to him<br />\npersuasively all the time.<br />\n\"You go to the Rue de Prony, number 208.<br />\nOn the ground floor to the right, a man, lives<br />\nwho goes to bed every night at nine o'clock,<br />\ndead drunk, with his door-key on the outside.<br />\nHe's rich and you can make a fine haul there,<br />\nbut I'd begin by cutting his throat if I were<br />\nyou, because he's a low blackguard with no<br />\nsympathy for the poor, and besides, he always<br />\nkeeps a revolver under his pillow and he's had<br />\nalarms put on all his drawers.\"<br />\nThey were just passing a cutler's shop, so<br />\nAthanase went in and bought him a fine clasp<br />\nknife.<br />\n\"Put that in your pocket,\" he said to Bagu,<br />\nwho obeyed him with the impassive stare<br />\nof a sleep-walker.<br />\n\"Let's go to a cafe.\"<br />\nAthenase poured absinthe and seltzer into<br />\nthe man until you'd have thought he'd burst.<br />\n\"Now, there you are,\" he said, leaving<br />\nhim, \"you'd best go directly. Remember<br />\nyour poor children, and do not hesitate!\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nwith the tone of authority of a superior person,<br />\nspeaking to some ignorant insignificant, he<br />\nsaid:<br />\n\"Monsieur, I possess nothing, it's with me<br />\nexactly as though I had just been born, everything is before me,\u2014to desire, to conquer and<br />\nto taste\u2014\"<br />\nDe Glidoir gave a hideous grimace which he<br />\nfondly believe to be a smile.<br />\n\"Come, come, Bagu, I'm a good sort of a<br />\nchap\u2014\"<br />\n\"You? Why, you're a low blackguard with<br />\nno sympathy for the poor!\"<br />\n\"Well, then, take my gold watch. Will<br />\nthat satisfy you? It's there on the chimneypiece.\"<br />\nWith his armed hand Bagu made a dignified<br />\ngesture.<br />\n\"I have children,\" he said. \"I belong to<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nDe Glidoir began to sob.<br />\n\"I cut you down when you'd hanged yourself, and saved your life! Was ever such ingratitude!\"<br />\nThe same gesture of offended dignity from<br />\nBagu.<br />\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"I am convinced that<br />\nI am doing you a service: being rich, you are<br />\na sort of dead-alive person with no destination,<br />\nnothing to desire, nothing to discover\u2014Don't<br />\ntake on so. I won't hurt you much. I know<br />\nhow to do it, because I've cut ducks' throats<br />\nfor years.\"<br />\nSo saying, Bagu again passed and repassed<br />\nthe blade over his arm to give it a final edge,<br />\nand then stood up.<br /><br />\nAthancase, wild with terror and scarcely<br />\nknowing what he was doing, cried out in a<br />\nloud voice as though it were absolutely necessary for him to know before he died:<br />\n\"And\u2014your children\u2014are they girls or<br />\nboys!\"<br />\nBagu stopped sharpening the knife, but he<br />\nturned up his sleeve in a business-like way:<br />\n\"Two girls: Marie and Je'anne.\"<br />\nAthanase, with an idiotic bleat, went on:<br />\n\"Ah, that's much better than boys!\"<br />\n\"Ye, much better,\" answered Bagu distantly, rubbing his thumb along the edge of<br />\nthe blade.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n\"I'm so fond of children,\" brayed de<br />\nGlidoir, squinting at the knife as though his<br />\nvisitor were about to dispatch a brace of<br />\ncherubim for,his consumption.<br />\nBagu shrngged his shoulders approvingly.<br />\n'I have their pictures somewhere,' he said.<br />\n\"I brought them with me to kiss them farewell.\"<br />\n\"Oh! do let me see them!\" begged de<br />\nGlidoir.<br />\n\"There,\" said Bagu, taking a small photograph from an inside pocket.<br />\nAthanase seized on it and giving an absurdly forced laugh, cried;<br />\n\"Ah! You said Marie and Jeanne, didn't<br />\nyou? This must be Marie, the elder. She's<br />\npretty, but Jeanne, she looks like a sly little<br />\npiece!\"<br />\n\"She is that!\" replied Bagu, beginning to<br />\nbe interested, \"you can ask anyone in the<br />\nneighborhood.\"<br />\n\"I simply can't take my eyes off them!\"<br />\ncried de Glidoir, \"they're just the kind of<br />\nchildren I adore!\"<br />\nBagu gave a deprecating smile and began<br />\nagain to strop the knife, this time on his<br />\nthigh. The gentleman's demonstrations<br />\nseemed perfectly natural to him.<br />\n\"Could you possibly give me this photograph?\" asked de Glidoir, with the avidity of<br />\na lover.<br />\nBagu's smile broadened. He was rather<br />\ntickled at the idea. \"Proud Papa,\" that sort<br />\nof thing. Instantly, though, his expression<br />\nchanged as though the smile had been stopped<br />\nby a ratchet. He stood with his mouth open<br />\nlike one hypnotized by some terrible, unheard<br />\nof difficulty. He looked first at the knife and<br />\nthen at Athanase; one could'nt give photographs to a dead man.<br />\n\"I'd like, to,\" he said in an embarassed<br />\ntone, \"but\u2014,\" and he stopped, confused by<br />\nthe dilemma between which he was caught.<br />\n\"Oh, come now,\" said de Glidoir, understanding the situation perfectly. He did not<br />\noffer to solve the problem, however, but<br />\nstudied the picture minutely.<br />\n\"I've never seen such interesting children's<br />\nfaces,\" he went on. `Ah! little Marie\u2014and<br />\nJeanne\u2014really, it,s awfully hard to decide<br />\nwhich\u2014they're both so\u2014!\"<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nHe pronounced the words with the deepest<br />\ninterest and respect. Bagu stood smiling,<br />\npleased and paternal. Then he again grew<br />\ngrave. What was he to do? He was caught<br />\nin a tight place between the poignard and the<br />\nportrait. He gave another smile:<br />\n\"No, Monsieur, you have never seen two<br />\nsuch little beauties,\"<br />\nAgain, he busied himself with the knife.<br />\nWhatever was he to do? It was a simple<br />\nmatter enough to kill this gentleman and<br />\nmake away with everything he had of any<br />\nvalue, but on the other hand, it seemed a<br />\npity to cut the throat of anyone who had such<br />\nobviously good taste.<br />\nFinally vanity came out the stronger. He<br />\ncould not do away with such a keen<br />\nappreciator of his children's beauty.<br />\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"you may keep the<br />\npicture.\"<br />\nHe closed the knife, put it in his hip pocket<br />\nand got up with the air of a casual visitor<br />\ntaking his leave.<br />\n\"Ah!\" said de Glidoir, embarassed apparently at accepting the gift, \"I really hardly<br />\nlike to deprive you\u2014\"<br />\n\"Oh! don't mention it, don't mention it,\"<br />\nsaid Bagu with a wave of his hand.<br />\nAnd in order to cut short these formalities,<br />\nhe walked toward the door. His role of<br />\nfather of the two charming daughters made<br />\nhim the equal of this admiring gentleman<br />\nand compelled him to noble manners.<br />\nHe had forgotten the possibilty of taking<br />\nanything of the least value. His poverty was<br />\nforgotten and every reality became negligible.<br />\nHe was enriched to infinity by paternal<br />\nvanity.<br />\nHe went out, his bosom sweling with pride,<br />\nmaking the same gesture of a gentleman<br />\ndeprecating a trifling service done for another.<br />\nSome people passing, were rather astonished<br />\nat the grand manner with which he said:<br />\n\"Not at all! not at all!\" as he closed the<br />\ndoor.<br />\nA lot is heard 'bout Presidents,<br />\nThe party's love for Taft;<br />\nWe wonder if this match will bring<br />\nTo both an Eppie-Taft.<br /><br />\nTHE POST-GRAD, THE GIRL AND THE<br />\nFOOTBALL GAME.<br />\nThis \"contribution\" (of which genus the smallest<br />\nis most gratefully, etc.,) was submitted with the<br />\nfollowing note:<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LliTTER:<br />\nDear Sir:\u2014This is a contribution from one who<br />\nis very much interested in the NUN/vs-LATTER\u2014an<br />\nM. M. G.<br />\nUndergrad, not a Post-Grad.<br /><br />\nWhirr-bang! The door-bell had hardly<br />\nstopped ringing when the staid old butler<br />\nthrew open the door and in walked the flurried<br />\nand anxious Post-Grad. Staggered by the<br />\nshining silver card tray, he lunged into his<br />\npocket with a desperate gasp in search of the<br />\nelusive pasteboard. Where on earth was it?<br />\nWhat made the butler smile in that supercilious way? Why, he had had the card as he<br />\ncame up the steps, and now\u2014and now\u2014good<br />\ngracious!\u2014it was in his left hand! The supercilious smile broadened into an open grin,as the<br />\ndignified white shirt front bowed him into the<br />\nparlor. He stepped gingerly over the slippery<br />\nfloor, glancing hopelessly at the spindlelegged gilt chairs and remained standing in<br />\nthe middle of the floor. A deliciously dainty<br />\nrustle of silk, the clicking of tiny French<br />\nheels on the stair\u2014there she stood in the<br />\ndoorway, a vision of fur and feathers, her<br />\nlong, dark cloak in marked contrast with her<br />\ndelicate pink cheeks.<br />\nThe Post-Grad took three hasty steps, but<br />\nalas!\u2014that slippery floor! The table\u2014the<br />\nchair\u2014what COULD he grasp? What\u2014but<br />\nnow it was too late\u2014his heels slipped, and the<br />\ndignified student of philosophy sprawled in a<br />\nhelpless tangle with the slender legs of the<br />\ngilded chair.<br />\nAt last he arose to his feet and, blushing<br />\nfuriously, stammered: 'Er\u2014ah\u2014isn't it a<br />\nnice day for the game?\" The girl, sweetly<br />\nignoring the mishap, but inwardly choking<br />\nwith laughter, led the way to the door, and<br />\ntogether they walked down the steps and<br />\nsilently hurried to the car.<br />\n\"We must be exceedingly early,\" the PostGrad remarked, as they took their seats.<br />\n\"Yes,\" said the girl, \"nobody seems to be<br />\ngoing to the game. Who's going to play,<br />\nanyhow?\"<br />\n\"Well, you see, er\u2014every year they play,<br />\nyou know, er \u2014that is, the Freshman and<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nJunior contingents choose ah\u2014eleven men to<br />\ndetermine\u2014ah, to decide\u2014I mean to play<br />\nfootball.\"<br />\n\"Oh how perfectly lovely! I wish I understood it as well as you do! But, of course,<br />\nyou have played so often.\"<br />\n\"Ah\u2014well; no\u2014that is\u2014not exactly. I<br />\nreceived an injury\u2014ah\u2014during the early\u2014in<br />\nthe first part of my Freshman year, and have<br />\nnever\u2014really played since.\"<br />\n\"Oh, how terrible!\" came the sympathetic<br />\ncry.<br />\n\"Ah, don't worry, not seriously you know<br />\n\u2014just ah\u2014only\u2014well you see\u2014I sprained<br />\nmy little finger\u2014\"<br />\nWhereupon the girl coughed suddenly and<br />\nlooked out the window.<br />\nAfter a long and embarassing silence, the<br />\ncar stopped and the Post-Grad rose.<br />\n\"Here's where we get out,\" he said.<br />\n\"Do we have to walk far?\" she asked.<br />\n(Ah\u2014er I don't know\u2014I should have inquired more particularily as to the way, but I<br />\nthink\u2014ah\u2014now I remember\u2014we go over<br />\nthere.<br />\nTogether they walked silently across the<br />\nroad, down the path, and over the bridge.<br />\n\"I don't see a single soul. We must be<br />\nvery early\u2014there's no one here at all,\" and<br />\nshe looked dolefully, first at the vast stretches<br />\nof mud, and then at her mud-bespattered<br />\nshoes.<br />\n\"I will get my tickets out anyhow,\" and<br />\nthe serious student extricated the tickets from<br />\nthe depths of his costume and began to peruse<br />\nthem slowly. Suddenly he stopped, gasped<br />\nand cried,<br />\n'What\u2014what day is today?\"<br />\n``The fifth.\"<br />\n\"Well\u2014it's\u2014the\u2014wrong\u2014day.\"<br />\nM. M.

Be sure to come.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nATHLETIC NOTES.<br />\nAgain has the Lacrosse Team of 1902 come<br />\nto the fore and offered to the Junior and Freshman Classes a set of individual trophies to be<br />\ncontested for by lacrosse teams from those<br />\nclasses. This is the third year that these<br />\ntrophies have been offered, and they have been<br />\nproductive of some excellent games. Last<br />\nyear the contests were not so interesting as the<br />\nyear before, when the present Senior Class,<br />\nthen Freshmen, took the class of 1907 into<br />\ncamp in the two games played.<br />\nThe generosity and spirit of the men who<br />\ncompose the team of 1902 is certainly to be<br />\ncommended, and it is to be hoped that the<br />\nclasses this year will show the proper appreciation of such a generous gift. It is a good<br />\nshowing for the spirit among our alumni,<br />\nwhen, in addition to contributions toward an<br />\nathletic field, they can subscribe to foster the<br />\nlacrosse spirit at the University. The NEWSLETTER takes great pleasure in thanking the<br />\n1902 team for their exceedingly kind offer on<br />\nbehalf of the students of the University.<br />\nThe Director of the Gymnasium has undertaken a worthy project, and one in which all<br />\nthe fellows should heartily co-operate. The<br />\nscheme is to supply those who use the shower<br />\nbaths with clean towels whenever wanted, at<br />\na cost price. He has gotten an appropriation<br />\nfrom the Board of Trustees, and with it will<br />\npurchase 1,000 bath towels. Now the plan is<br />\nthis: Each fellow who wants a towel is to<br />\nsign a card and pay a dollar. He may either<br />\npay a dollar in advance, or it may be taken off<br />\nhis caution money at the end of the year: that<br />\npoint has not been settled as yet. By paying<br />\nthis dollar, he is entitled to a clean towel<br />\nwhenever he may wish it. This privilege will<br />\ncontinue from now until the University<br />\ncloses. This is an excellent plan, and will<br />\ndo away with lots of trouble. Instead of<br />\nhaving to bring towels from home, or rent<br />\nthem from \"Jim,\" a man may have a clean<br />\ntowel whenever he wishes, at the low cost of<br />\none dollar for five months. This one dollar<br />\nrepresents the cost of laundering. Now, in<br />\norder to make this scheme work, there must be<br />\na big crowd in it. There must be at least 100<br />\nbathers sign up for the towels. If the plan<br />\nworks, and it certainly ought if the students<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ngive it the proper backing, Dr. Abercrombie<br />\nis to be congratulated, for he will have supplied a long-felt want, and added one more<br />\ncomfort to the locker room.<br /><br />\nLACROSSE TEAM.<br />\nThe lacrosse season is in full blast, and<br />\nsoon you will see the usual number of swollen<br />\nfingers, and cut heads as a result of practising<br />\nin the cage. The prospects for a winning<br />\nteam are good, but there are several positions<br />\nyet to be filled. From time to time the daily<br />\nnewspapers have come out with fore-casts of<br />\nwhat the line-up will be. To the candidates<br />\nlet this be said: Pay no attention to what the<br />\npapers say, for they are usually far from<br />\nright, particularly with regard to Hopkins<br />\nteams. There is some time yet before the<br />\nfirst game, and surprises are likely to happen<br />\nat any time. Sometimes fellows do not make<br />\nthe team until the last game, so keep your<br />\nnerve with you. Remember the class teams.<br />\nIf you play on the winning class team, you<br />\nwill get a fine gold medal. Juniors, you have<br />\nnot won at lacrosse as yet, and you can't<br />\nafford to be beaten by the Freshmen. Freshmen, you were beaten in football, now get<br />\nbusy and retrieve yourselves by licking the<br />\nJuniors in lacrosse. It has been done before,<br />\nand can be done again.<br />\nThis year the Lacrosse League, in addition<br />\nto giving a trophy to the winning team, will<br />\ngive individual trophies to the players on<br />\nchampionship teams. Hopkins must win the<br />\nchampionship, and everybody must do his<br />\nbest to land that coveted title. Let us see if<br />\nthe team of 1908 can't be the one to make it<br />\nthree championships straight.<br /><br />\nCOTILLON CLUB.<br />\nThe time for the next Cotillon Club Dance<br />\nis almost here, and there are many subscribers<br />\nwho have not yet paid anything on their dues,<br />\nnot even for the first dance. This state of<br />\naffairs is positively disgraceful. How do you<br />\nexpect us to give these dances in the proper<br />\nstyle? You do not seem to realize that it<br />\ntakes ready money to run these dances, and<br />\nunless one hundred dollars more is paid up it<br /><br />\nwill be impossible to give the other two<br />\ndances. The Board .of Governors is working<br />\nas hard as it possibly can to collect the money,<br />\nbut it met with very little success before the<br />\nChristmas Holidays. Let us hope that it will<br />\nbe more successful in the New Year. Everyone before Christmas was crying hard times,<br />\nbut now that it is past and everyone received<br />\nlots of money at Christmas, there is no excuse<br />\nfor not paying.<br />\nThe Cotillon Club Dances are not supported<br />\nby the students as well as they should be. It<br />\nused to be that everyone was anxious to<br />\nattend the Cotillons, and did not have to be<br />\nbegged to come. When one remembers that<br />\nthe Cotillon Club Dances\u2014and there are only<br />\nthree during the year\u2014are the only social<br />\nactivity at Hopkins, one ought to feel ashamed<br />\nto think that the students have to be beseached<br />\nand implored to subscribe to the dances, and<br />\neven then enough subscriptions can not be<br />\nraised to insure the success of the dances.<br />\nThe three upper classes are well represented<br />\nmore or less, but the Freshmen did not make<br />\nas good a showing as was expected of them.<br />\nFreshmen, it is no excuse to say that you are<br />\ntoo busy, or have too much work, for both of<br />\nthe remaining dances are on Friday nights.<br />\nAnother point is that we will not have the<br />\ntone of these dances lowered. All the gentlemen are requested to wear either tuxedos or<br />\nfull dress. We think that only a word on<br />\nthis subject will be sufficient.<br />\nWe should like to take this opportunity to<br />\nremark upon the lack of interest which is<br />\nshown by the chaperons in the dances. There<br />\nis always a list of about twenty-five chaperons<br />\non the programs, but usually there are present<br />\nonly about three or at the most five. These<br />\nare generally the same ones and we take<br />\ngreat pleasure in extending to them our<br />\nheartiest thanks, and hope that they will continue to take interest in the dances. What a<br />\ndreadful plight we should be in, if the few<br />\nfaithful ones should ever desert us!<br /><br />\nA Prof. whose only Reliance,<br />\nWas placed on the subject of Science,<br />\nWas married last year;<br />\nNow the baby is here,<br />\nAnd papa now works for his Viands.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nHOWARD STREET.<br />\nAs I was walking down Howard street<br />\nthe other morning, with considerable<br />\nrapidity,<br />\nI met a drunken man,<br />\nWho approached me in that peculiar<br />\nstaggering manner, affected by drunken<br />\nmen, and said:<br />\n\"Please tell me, if you can,<br /><br />\nILGENFRITZ STUDIO<br />\nSuccessor to CUMMINS<br /><br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY<br />\n20 West Lexington Street<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nSpecial Discount to Students<br /><br />\n\"The Men's Store.\"<br /><br />\nHUTZLER.
