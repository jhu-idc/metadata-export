LEVY<br />\nMr. Edgar Kemler, the Great Mentarian and comrade of Voltaire, Erasmus, Cervantes, and Shaw, has presumably submerged his \"human\" ego<br />\nin an \"anti-human\" discernment of<br />\nthe \"cold<br />\n<br />\nfacts<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nuniverse\"<br />\n<br />\nwhich, despite the \"awful opposition<br />\nof his spontaneous emotions,\" he has<br />\nnow proceeded to read into life. What<br />\na truly remarkable achievement! But<br />\nit is really unfortunate that the Mentarian ego has been thus submerged.<br />\nElse how it would revel in this glorious triumph of the pure intellect over<br />\nthe base animal passions of the amoeba, the dog, and Huey Long!<br />\nThe essence of the Mentarian Manifesto\u2014stripped of the glittering sophistries of Kemlerian verbosity\u2014seems<br />\nto be that the Mentarian is a man,<br />\nbut a new breed of man, and as such<br />\nquite distinct from the rest of the<br />\nspecies. But even Mr. Kemler will<br />\ncertainly admit that the great intellects of all time have had to concern<br />\nthemselves about the vulgar necessities of mere animal existence before ascending to the chilly stratosphere in which the pure intellect holds<br />\nsway. Thus they are essentially the<br />\nsame as men. AND LIKE ALL MEN<br />\nTHE FUNCTIONING OF THEIR<br />\nINTELLECT IS CONDITIONED BY<br />\nTHE MATERIAL ENVIRONMENT<br />\n<br />\nWe Congratulate<br />\n<br />\nIN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

By various<br />\nclever means Benedick, the \"bachelor,\" becomes Bendeick, the \"marrie man,\" and Claudio finds a lovely wife in Hero, but not until after\u2014<br />\nwell, why say?<br />\nThe leading roles of Bendeick and<br />\nBeatrice are handled by Williaw Oberle and Hilary Sash, respectively.<br />\nTwo experienced actors, they carried<br />\ntheir parts with a polish and precision which denotes that they are accomplished thespians.<br />\nThe role of Hero was taken by the<br />\n\"Sweeatheart of Hopkins\", Miss Alice<br />\nClautice. Miss Clautice takes this<br />\npart, and figuratively speaking,<br />\n\"knocks it for a loop.\" There is little doubt that within the next few<br />\nyears with a little more experience,<br />\nMiss Clautice can look forward to<br />\nsuccess on a Broadway stages. Her<br />\nexcellent emotional ability is demonstrated vividly during the scene in<br />\nwhich Hero learns of derogatory remarks concerning he chastity. She<br />\nchanges from a sweet blushing bride<br />\nto a horror stricken individual with<br />\nsuch convincing realism that had old<br />\nBill Shake seen Miss Clautice. in the<br />\npart of Hero, he would have undoubtedly changed the lines so as to lessen<br />\nthe shock brought about by gullible<br />\nClaudio.<br />\nDirector Hinrichs is one of the few<br />\nBaltimore directors who can handle<br />\na role capably and at the same time<br />\ndirect a play. Mr. Hinrichs appeared<br />\non the stage in the role of Don Pedro. He acted his part with great finesse, giving evidence of his many<br />\nyears of stage experience.<br />\nMr. A. H. Young-O'Brien, in his<br />\n<br />\nrole of Dogberry, very humorously<br />\nplayed the part of the village constable.<br />\nAlexander Boas, as the handsome<br />\nsuitor for the hand of Hero, will, I<br />\nthink with a few more performances,<br />\ncarry his part in a more definite way.<br />\nAt present he seems a little shaky.<br />\nThis may be accounted for when it is<br />\ntaken into consideration that Mr.<br />\nBoas is making his first attempt at<br />\nShakespeare.<br />\nMr. Carl Barron, well-known Playmaster and experienced Shakespearean actor, handles his role as \"villain\" with a silky smoothness. Mr.<br />\nJones played the part of Antonio, in<br />\nTwelfth Night\u201e and was also seen in<br />\nShe Stoops to Conquer, by Olivet<br />\nGoldsmith.<br />\nAn excellent performance was rendered by Charles Perry in the role of<br />\nLeonata, father of Hero. Others in<br />\nthe cast are John Noon, Constance<br />\nCarroll, John McDivett and Warren<br />\nJones.<br />\nThe Playmasters, producers of this<br />\nplay, were organized in the early<br />\npart of 1934. Their aim is to produce \"plays by masters\" in a modern<br />\nup-to-date manner. Thus far this season their plays have been \"Twelfth<br />\nNight,\" \"She Stoops to Conquer,\"<br />\n\"Cargo From Rhodes,\" and \"Much<br />\nAdo About Nothing.\"<br />\n\"Twelfth Night,\" in response to<br />\npopular demand, will return to the<br />\nGuild Theatre with an opening performance tonight.

Phil Criblet, whose facility for cursing is rivaled only by the Quirt-Flagg duo of<br />\nflicker fame, once again appeared in<br />\na role which allowed him to give full<br />\nvent to pent-up emotions via the vocal<br />\nchords.

A check of practically every foot of the<br />\nway was made to determine if temporary obstructions could be removed to allow the load<br />\nto pass. From Schenectady to Wilkes-Barre,<br />\nPa., the car traveled on the Delaware & Hudson. From Wilkes-Barre, the ear was sent to<br />\nHagerstown, Md., on the Pennsylvania Railroad, where it was turned over to the Western<br />\nMaryland Railroad. After an extensive detour,<br />\nit was delivered back to the Pennsylvania on<br />\nits main line just south of the Baltimore<br />\ntunnels, which were the principal reasons for<br />\nthe complicated routing.

LEVY<br />\nMr. Edgar Kemler, the Great Mentarian and comrade of Voltaire, Erasmus, Cervantes, and Shaw, has presumably submerged his \"human\" ego<br />\nin an \"anti-human\" discernment of<br />\nthe \"cold<br /><br />\nfacts<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nuniverse\"<br /><br />\nwhich, despite the \"awful opposition<br />\nof his spontaneous emotions,\" he has<br />\nnow proceeded to read into life. What<br />\na truly remarkable achievement! But<br />\nit is really unfortunate that the Mentarian ego has been thus submerged.<br />\nElse how it would revel in this glorious triumph of the pure intellect over<br />\nthe base animal passions of the amoeba, the dog, and Huey Long!<br />\nThe essence of the Mentarian Manifesto\u2014stripped of the glittering sophistries of Kemlerian verbosity\u2014seems<br />\nto be that the Mentarian is a man,<br />\nbut a new breed of man, and as such<br />\nquite distinct from the rest of the<br />\nspecies. But even Mr. Kemler will<br />\ncertainly admit that the great intellects of all time have had to concern<br />\nthemselves about the vulgar necessities of mere animal existence before ascending to the chilly stratosphere in which the pure intellect holds<br />\nsway. Thus they are essentially the<br />\nsame as men.

By various<br />\nclever means Benedick, the \"bachelor,\" becomes Bendeick, the \"marrie man,\" and Claudio finds a lovely wife in Hero, but not until after\u2014<br />\nwell, why say?<br />\nThe leading roles of Bendeick and<br />\nBeatrice are handled by Williaw Oberle and Hilary Sash, respectively.<br />\nTwo experienced actors, they carried<br />\ntheir parts with a polish and precision which denotes that they are accomplished thespians.<br />\nThe role of Hero was taken by the<br />\n\"Sweeatheart of Hopkins\", Miss Alice<br />\nClautice. Miss Clautice takes this<br />\npart, and figuratively speaking,<br />\n\"knocks it for a loop.\" There is little doubt that within the next few<br />\nyears with a little more experience,<br />\nMiss Clautice can look forward to<br />\nsuccess on a Broadway stages. Her<br />\nexcellent emotional ability is demonstrated vividly during the scene in<br />\nwhich Hero learns of derogatory remarks concerning he chastity. She<br />\nchanges from a sweet blushing bride<br />\nto a horror stricken individual with<br />\nsuch convincing realism that had old<br />\nBill Shake seen Miss Clautice. in the<br />\npart of Hero, he would have undoubtedly changed the lines so as to lessen<br />\nthe shock brought about by gullible<br />\nClaudio.<br />\nDirector Hinrichs is one of the few<br />\nBaltimore directors who can handle<br />\na role capably and at the same time<br />\ndirect a play. Mr. Hinrichs appeared<br />\non the stage in the role of Don Pedro. He acted his part with great finesse, giving evidence of his many<br />\nyears of stage experience.<br />\nMr. A. H. Young-O'Brien, in his<br /><br />\nrole of Dogberry, very humorously<br />\nplayed the part of the village constable.<br />\nAlexander Boas, as the handsome<br />\nsuitor for the hand of Hero, will, I<br />\nthink with a few more performances,<br />\ncarry his part in a more definite way.<br />\nAt present he seems a little shaky.<br />\nThis may be accounted for when it is<br />\ntaken into consideration that Mr.<br />\nBoas is making his first attempt at<br />\nShakespeare.<br />\nMr. Carl Barron, well-known Playmaster and experienced Shakespearean actor, handles his role as \"villain\" with a silky smoothness. Mr.<br />\nJones played the part of Antonio, in<br />\nTwelfth Night\u201e and was also seen in<br />\nShe Stoops to Conquer, by Olivet<br />\nGoldsmith.<br />\nAn excellent performance was rendered by Charles Perry in the role of<br />\nLeonata, father of Hero. Others in<br />\nthe cast are John Noon, Constance<br />\nCarroll, John McDivett and Warren<br />\nJones.<br />\nThe Playmasters, producers of this<br />\nplay, were organized in the early<br />\npart of 1934. Their aim is to produce \"plays by masters\" in a modern<br />\nup-to-date manner. Thus far this season their plays have been \"Twelfth<br />\nNight,\" \"She Stoops to Conquer,\"<br />\n\"Cargo From Rhodes,\" and \"Much<br />\nAdo About Nothing.\"<br />\n\"Twelfth Night,\" in response to<br />\npopular demand, will return to the<br />\nGuild Theatre with an opening performance tonight.

A check of practically every foot of the<br />\nway was made to determine if temporary obstructions could be removed to allow the load<br />\nto pass. From Schenectady to Wilkes-Barre,<br />\nPa., the car traveled on the Delaware &amp; Hudson. From Wilkes-Barre, the ear was sent to<br />\nHagerstown, Md., on the Pennsylvania Railroad, where it was turned over to the Western<br />\nMaryland Railroad. After an extensive detour,<br />\nit was delivered back to the Pennsylvania on<br />\nits main line just south of the Baltimore<br />\ntunnels, which were the principal reasons for<br />\nthe complicated routing.
