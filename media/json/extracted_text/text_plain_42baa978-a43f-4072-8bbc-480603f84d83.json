On Saturday, however,<br />\nit was no match for the seasoned<br />\nteam of the Maryland Agricultural<br />\nCollege; the final result being 26<br />\nto o.<br />\nThe Aggies had a fast, heavy<br />\nteam, and played good football<br />\nfrom the start. It was their third<br />\nvictory of the season in \u2022 as many<br />\ngames, while many of the 'Varsity<br />\nhad had only a single week's practice.<br />\n\u2022 The game started with Tippett<br />\nkicking off to the Aggies, who immediately began things with a rush,<br />\nand scored the first touchdown in<br />\nfour plays. The ball was carried<br />\nover by Morris, and after a punt out<br />\nfrom the corner of the field, Shipley<br />\nkicked an easy goal.<br />\nAt the next kick-off the 'Varsity<br />\nbraced and held the Aggies scoreless until the middle of the third<br />\nquarter. The Black and Blue was<br />\nmainly on the defensive, however,<br />\nkicking whenever it had the ball in<br />\nits own territory. It was in the first<br />\nquarter, soon after the Aggies' first<br />\ntouchdown, that the 'Varsity had its<br />\nonly chance to score. Tippett intercepted one of the Aggies forward<br />\npasses on his thirty-yard line, and<br />\nby clever running advanced the ball<br />\nto the middle of the field. Line<br />\nplunges forwarded the ball nine<br />\nyards more in three plays, and<br />\nChunn made it first down on the<br />\nnext. A Hopkins man was off side,<br />\nhowever, and the ball was brought<br />\nback. Fulton gave the signal for<br />\na placement kick, but the distance<br />\nwas too great, and Wilkinson's effort went wide. After this, Hopkins failed to do any offensive work.<br />\nIn the middle of the third quarter,<br />\nthe Aggies started once more and<br />\nrushed the ball to the ten-yard line.<br />\nHere the 'Varsity braced up, and on<br />\nthe first two downs the Aggies did<br />\nnot gain. On the third th - y made<br />\na bit, while Knode carried the ball<br />\nover for the second touchdown on<br />\nthe next play.

Tippett kicked to Shipley<br />\non the Aggies' forty-yard line.<br />\nRuff made a beautiful run to our<br />\nforty-yard line around left end until<br />\nhe was downed by Tippett. Tippett<br />\nfigured in a similar play when Shipley took the ball to the ten-yard line.<br />\nMorris took the ball over after two<br />\ndowns, going through leftend and<br />\ntackle.

Mr. Levering<br />\nspoke mainly on the benefits that a<br />\ncollege course can be to the student, and gave some very good advice as to how a man should gain<br />\nthese benefits, emphasizing t h e<br />\nwork of the Y. M. C. A. as a great<br />\nhelping agent in the students' university life.<br />\nFollowing Mr. Levering, students representative of the many<br />\nlines of activity in the University<br />\nspoke. Mr. Sutton gave a very<br />\ngraphic and appealing talk on the<br />\nwork of the Y. M. C. A., especially<br />\nalong lines of Bible study and missions. Messrs.

Last year was the first time<br />\nthat such an agreement was tried<br />\nhere. It was then universally acknowledged to be highly satisfactory and desirable, although in its<br />\ndetail many points needed more<br />\ncareful working out and less ambiguous wording. Upon this task<br />\nof reconstruction the Interfraternity<br />\nBoard has been working continuously since last April and has just<br />\ncome to an agreement. In this process practically every fraternity has<br />\nfound it necessary to sacrifice some<br />\nfavorite principle for the betterment of -fraternity conditions at<br />\nHopkins; and, although at times it<br />\nhas gone extremely hard with some,<br />\nan excellent spirit of pulling together has been shown.<br />\nThe object of the agreement is to<br />\neliminate rushing from prep.schools<br />\nand to wipe out the evils of the<br />\nsystem of several years ago, under<br />\nwhich men were often pledged to fraternities before they realized<br />\ntheir significance or had opportunity<br />\nto compare their merits.<br />\nThe document is concise and plain<br />\nand should be carefully studied by<br />\nall interested in it, and its details<br />\nstrictly adhered to.<br />\nAnd the interfraternity agreement<br />\ndeserves the commendation of the<br />\nentire University. It is indicative<br />\nof the spirit with which the fraternities regard our University\u2014the<br />\nsacrifice of selfish fraternity interests for the good of our University<br />\nat large. It shows that the fraternities regard the questions of rushing<br />\nfrom the standpoint of the freshmen, as well as from their own<br />\nstandpoints, and desire to do the<br />\nright thing by them. Finally, it<br />\nshows the Hopkins get-together<br />\nspirit in marked contrast to any<br />\nfactionalism or cliquishness. The<br />\nagreement has now passed through<br />\nits period of probation, and is here<br />\nto stay for the good of Johns Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nSMART<br />\nFOR<br />\n<br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE 10 MEASURE<br />\n<br />\nPLAZA BLDG.<br />\n\u00a7<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br />\n<br />\n5.<br />\n=<br />\n<br />\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 I If<br />\n<br />\nIII I<br />\n<br />\n311111111110<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN<br />\n<br />\nSHOES<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\n-FOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well\u2014 fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br />\n<br />\nLEFRANC & AULT<br />\nSELL<br />\n<br />\nFownes Gloves<br />\nAT THE<br />\n<br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP\"<br />\n421 N.

I think that the sophomore class can stand an admonitory<br />\nelocution also. The matter is about<br />\nthe hazing indulged in on \"freshman day\"\u2014last Monday. I regret<br />\nsincerely that the sophomores have<br />\nnot fallen in entirely with the deanic<br />\nspirit of neighborly love. Knowest<br />\nnot, soph, that the freshie is thy<br />\nneighbor? Thou shouldest foster<br />\nand protect the budding genius, and<br />\nnot mortify and flubricate him; yea,<br />\neven to the point of climbing lamp<br />\nposts and pushing two-wheeled gocarts \u2014 verily, servile and menial<br />\ntasks, as it were. I can only say<br />\nthat I hope that when this year's<br />\nfreshmen become sophs, they will<br />\nreturn good for evil and show the<br />\nproper way of treating freshies.<br />\nLet me not, however, be misunderstood. I have nothing at all<br />\nto say against the solemn rites and<br />\nceremonies of initiation. This is, indeed, an ancient and sacred custom.<br />\nI verily believe that no freshman<br />\nwould feel himself a true \"bone<br />\nfide\" matriculate, had he not been<br />\nduly initiated. The initiation ceremonies are varied from year to year,<br />\nso that there may be no aspluavistic<br />\nmonotony. One time-honored ceremony strikes me as being well<br />\nworthy of continued observance\u2014<br />\nnamely, the washing in the pool of<br />\nMt. Vernon. These annual ablutions have quite an impressive symbolism. The freshman enters Hopkins soiled and marred by contact<br />\nwith the sordid world. He is full<br />\nof vain thoughts of cribs, \"cuties,\"<br />\ntango, etc. Quite right would it be<br />\nfor him to beseech the manent<br />\nsoph : \"Wash me, that I may<br />\nbe whiter than snow.\" Then the<br />\nlatter will sternly reply: \"Get in the<br />\nfountain, fool.\" The freshman<br />\nobeys and returns refreshed in body,<br />\nsoul and spirit.

It was their third<br />\nvictory of the season in \u2022 as many<br />\ngames, while many of the 'Varsity<br />\nhad had only a single week's practice.<br />\n\u2022 The game started with Tippett<br />\nkicking off to the Aggies, who immediately began things with a rush,<br />\nand scored the first touchdown in<br />\nfour plays. The ball was carried<br />\nover by Morris, and after a punt out<br />\nfrom the corner of the field, Shipley<br />\nkicked an easy goal.<br />\nAt the next kick-off the 'Varsity<br />\nbraced and held the Aggies scoreless until the middle of the third<br />\nquarter. The Black and Blue was<br />\nmainly on the defensive, however,<br />\nkicking whenever it had the ball in<br />\nits own territory. It was in the first<br />\nquarter, soon after the Aggies' first<br />\ntouchdown, that the 'Varsity had its<br />\nonly chance to score. Tippett intercepted one of the Aggies forward<br />\npasses on his thirty-yard line, and<br />\nby clever running advanced the ball<br />\nto the middle of the field. Line<br />\nplunges forwarded the ball nine<br />\nyards more in three plays, and<br />\nChunn made it first down on the<br />\nnext. A Hopkins man was off side,<br />\nhowever, and the ball was brought<br />\nback. Fulton gave the signal for<br />\na placement kick, but the distance<br />\nwas too great, and Wilkinson's effort went wide. After this, Hopkins failed to do any offensive work.<br />\nIn the middle of the third quarter,<br />\nthe Aggies started once more and<br />\nrushed the ball to the ten-yard line.<br />\nHere the 'Varsity braced up, and on<br />\nthe first two downs the Aggies did<br />\nnot gain.

Saturday will be<br />\na good day to put into practice that<br />\nchoice motto of the Booster Club:<br />\n\"Root or be rooted.\"<br />\nThe Interfraternity Agreement.<br /><br />\nThe new interfraternity agreement has received the signatures of<br />\nthe six fraternities and becomes the<br />\ncommon code by which they are<br />\nbound. Last year was the first time<br />\nthat such an agreement was tried<br />\nhere. It was then universally acknowledged to be highly satisfactory and desirable, although in its<br />\ndetail many points needed more<br />\ncareful working out and less ambiguous wording. Upon this task<br />\nof reconstruction the Interfraternity<br />\nBoard has been working continuously since last April and has just<br />\ncome to an agreement. In this process practically every fraternity has<br />\nfound it necessary to sacrifice some<br />\nfavorite principle for the betterment of -fraternity conditions at<br />\nHopkins; and, although at times it<br />\nhas gone extremely hard with some,<br />\nan excellent spirit of pulling together has been shown.<br />\nThe object of the agreement is to<br />\neliminate rushing from prep.schools<br />\nand to wipe out the evils of the<br />\nsystem of several years ago, under<br />\nwhich men were often pledged to fraternities before they realized<br />\ntheir significance or had opportunity<br />\nto compare their merits.<br />\nThe document is concise and plain<br />\nand should be carefully studied by<br />\nall interested in it, and its details<br />\nstrictly adhered to.<br />\nAnd the interfraternity agreement<br />\ndeserves the commendation of the<br />\nentire University. It is indicative<br />\nof the spirit with which the fraternities regard our University\u2014the<br />\nsacrifice of selfish fraternity interests for the good of our University<br />\nat large. It shows that the fraternities regard the questions of rushing<br />\nfrom the standpoint of the freshmen, as well as from their own<br />\nstandpoints, and desire to do the<br />\nright thing by them. Finally, it<br />\nshows the Hopkins get-together<br />\nspirit in marked contrast to any<br />\nfactionalism or cliquishness. The<br />\nagreement has now passed through<br />\nits period of probation, and is here<br />\nto stay for the good of Johns Hopkins.<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nSMART<br />\nFOR<br /><br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE 10 MEASURE<br /><br />\nPLAZA BLDG.<br />\n\u00a7<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br /><br />\n5.<br />\n=<br /><br />\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 I If<br /><br />\nIII I<br /><br />\n311111111110<br /><br />\nWYMAN<br /><br />\nSHOES<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\n-FOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well\u2014 fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br /><br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br />\nSELL<br /><br />\nFownes Gloves<br />\nAT THE<br /><br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP\"<br />\n421 N.

I think that the sophomore class can stand an admonitory<br />\nelocution also. The matter is about<br />\nthe hazing indulged in on \"freshman day\"\u2014last Monday. I regret<br />\nsincerely that the sophomores have<br />\nnot fallen in entirely with the deanic<br />\nspirit of neighborly love. Knowest<br />\nnot, soph, that the freshie is thy<br />\nneighbor? Thou shouldest foster<br />\nand protect the budding genius, and<br />\nnot mortify and flubricate him; yea,<br />\neven to the point of climbing lamp<br />\nposts and pushing two-wheeled gocarts \u2014 verily, servile and menial<br />\ntasks, as it were. I can only say<br />\nthat I hope that when this year's<br />\nfreshmen become sophs, they will<br />\nreturn good for evil and show the<br />\nproper way of treating freshies.<br />\nLet me not, however, be misunderstood. I have nothing at all<br />\nto say against the solemn rites and<br />\nceremonies of initiation. This is, indeed, an ancient and sacred custom.<br />\nI verily believe that no freshman<br />\nwould feel himself a true \"bone<br />\nfide\" matriculate, had he not been<br />\nduly initiated. The initiation ceremonies are varied from year to year,<br />\nso that there may be no aspluavistic<br />\nmonotony. One time-honored ceremony strikes me as being well<br />\nworthy of continued observance\u2014<br />\nnamely, the washing in the pool of<br />\nMt. Vernon. These annual ablutions have quite an impressive symbolism. The freshman enters Hopkins soiled and marred by contact<br />\nwith the sordid world. He is full<br />\nof vain thoughts of cribs, \"cuties,\"<br />\ntango, etc. Quite right would it be<br />\nfor him to beseech the manent<br />\nsoph : \"Wash me, that I may<br />\nbe whiter than snow.\" Then the<br />\nlatter will sternly reply: \"Get in the<br />\nfountain, fool.\" The freshman<br />\nobeys and returns refreshed in body,<br />\nsoul and spirit.
