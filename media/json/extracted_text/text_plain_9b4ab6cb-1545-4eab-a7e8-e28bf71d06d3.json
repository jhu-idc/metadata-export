But while one knows what to<br />\nexpect from the APL, it's a little distressing<br />\nto find other, supposedly more \"impartial\"<br />\nand \"academic\" branches of the University<br />\npaying their dues to special interests.<br />\nThis week the House of Delegates of<br />\nthe Maryland State Legislature passed a bill<br />\nthat would raise the ceiling on interest rates<br />\nto 24 percent throughout the entire state<br />\nlending industry. The bill, which is the<br />\nfinal compromise version of a series of<br />\nprevious bills, is a direct concession to<br />\nbanks in Maryland, a number of which have<br />\nalready shifted their credit operations to<br />\nother states where they can charge higher<br />\ninterest rates. The current interest rate<br />\nceiling in Maryland is between 12 and 18<br />\npercent, depending on the type of loan.<br />\nThe bill is still in committee in the<br />\nSenate, but if, as expected, it passes, a good<br />\nshare of the credit (pardon the expression)<br />\nbelongs to none other than the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Metro Center. A study<br />\nconducted by Metro Center staff economists, at the request of Governor Harry<br />\nHughes, led the Center to recommend the<br />\ncomplete lifting of all interest rate ceilings<br />\nin the state.<br />\nSome might question terming the<br />\nCenter's study a payment of its dues to the<br />\nbanking industry; after all, the study was<br />\nconducted by academics who were supposedly interested in finding out what is<br />\nbest for the people of Maryland. In isolation, this view sounds good, but two other<br />\nfactors undermine it severely:<br />\nthe<br />\n\"stacked\" membership of the Metro<br />\nCenter's recommendation committee, and<br />\nthe Center's history of biased studies.<br />\nThe Metro-Center's Task Force on<br />\nInterest Deregulation, the group which<br />\nmade the recommendations based on the<br />\nstudy, was made up almost entirely of<br />\nofficers of major banking concerns. Committee member Margie Muller, vicepresident of Union Trust Bank and the wife<br />\nof JHU president Steven Muller, is quoted<br />\non the front page of this issue as saying<br />\nthat \"it's perfectly normal\" for people to<br />\nquestion the membership of the committee. What she doesn't seem to realize is<br />\n<br />\nthat the membership of the committee<br />\ninvalidates both the Metro Center's claim<br />\nto acting as an academic institution and its<br />\nauthority as a source of recommendation.<br />\nIt may be that the actual study showed<br />\nthat the banks, if not placated, would shift<br />\ntheir operations and thus adversely effect<br />\ncustomers \u2014 but it was the members of the<br />\ntask force who recommended what to do<br />\non the basis of that information, and their<br />\nrecommendations clearly reflect their own<br />\nconcerns.<br />\nBesides, this is not the only time that<br />\n\u2022the Metro Center has been accused of bias<br />\nin its studies. Two years ago, it published<br />\na study which sought to determine whether<br />\nor not longtime, low-income residents in<br />\nSouth 9altimore neighborhoods were being<br />\ndisplaced by the new development and<br />\n\"gentrification\" of the city. The study<br />\nclaimed that displacement was going on at<br />\na rate of only two percent; its methodology<br />\nwas promptly attacked by journalists, city<br />\nplanners, and fellow academics, including<br />\nHopkins professor David Harvey. The<br />\nBaltimore Department of City Planning<br />\nregarded the study's evidence as so inconclusive that it promptly commissioned its<br />\nown study, which is still ongoing.<br />\nThus, the studies of the Metro<br />\nCenter may reflect a bias in methodology \u2014<br />\nthe present study on interest rate deregulation all but puts forth the actual recommendations made by the task force. One<br />\ndoes not like to charge the study's authors<br />\nwith bad motives, and one does not have<br />\nto: it may simply be that the Metro Center<br />\nchooses economists with a particular kind<br />\nof outlook, knowing that the methodology<br />\nthey will employ will ultimately support<br />\nthe Metro Center's business-oriented goals.<br />\nThere can be no question that the<br />\nMetro Center's studies are highly influential. The studies cannot be faulted for<br />\nwhat they say \u2014 perhaps interest rate<br />\nderegulation is the best answer -- but for<br />\nwho they say it on behalf of. The Center's<br />\ncontrolling membership is so ludicrously<br />\nstacked in favor of business that it can no<br />\nlonger be regarded as \"academically objective.\" Asking it for advice on consumer<br />\naffairs seems to be the same as asking the<br />\nAPL for recommendations on how to cut<br />\nthe defense budget.<br />\n<br />\nCover by<br />\nDana Gillian<br />\n<br />\nHonor The Faculty<br />\nBut Do It Right<br />\nBY MITCHELL D.

This is what<br />\nwins votes. I remember the<br />\ndisastrous results several years<br />\nago of a young Trustee candidate who distributed his photograph and biography in the mail<br />\nboxes: he ended up scattered all<br />\nover the floor, mustached and<br />\ndefaced. The answer is to<br />\nemploy a more utilitarian means<br />\nfor advertising candidates. Beer<br />\n<br />\ncompanies and rock groups<br />\nspread their names and faces<br />\nthroughout malls, schools, and<br />\ncity streets by a means that also<br />\nwould work for Student Council<br />\ncandidates: photo T-shirts and<br />\nparaphernalia.<br />\nThe shirts would show the<br />\ncandidate's face and name, and,<br />\nin addition, would reveal his or<br />\nher supporters. If you didn't<br />\npersonally know Grant Lally, for<br />\nexample, you might know someone who wore a Grant Lally<br />\nT-shirt. You would judge Danny<br />\nKao by seeing what kind of<br />\npeople wore his wind-breakers.<br />\nI would wear a Danny Kao<br />\nwind-breaker even after the<br />\nelection. It's trendy and fashionable to wear avante garde<br />\nparaphernalia. Soon, everyone<br />\nback home would want a Danny<br />\nKao wind-breaker. Remember<br />\nthe rise and spread of the<br />\nhula-hoop?<br />\nThis is one simple solution<br />\nof how to publicize Student<br />\nCouncil candidates.

These rumors were absolutely false and a sleazy attempt<br />\nto personally discredit me.

In a<br />\nschool as academically inclined<br />\nas Johns Hopkins it is both nice<br />\nand enjoyable to have some<br />\nnon-academic influences.<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nbrings a favorable facet to the<br />\nHopkins community which is<br />\nnot provided for anywhere else.<br />\nFor being a Division I championship team which is strongly<br />\nrecruited for their expertise in<br />\nlacrosse they do not receive all<br />\nthat much special attention.<br />\nThey don't eat steaks at a<br />\ntraining table like football players at Division I football powerhouses,and they are required to<br />\ntake 12 credits per semester at<br />\nHopkins. They are not untouchable; in fact they probably get<br />\ninto more trouble and are<br />\nwatched more carefully than any<br />\nother group of students. We<br />\nnever hear any complaints about<br />\nthe number of students who<br />\nhave been caught cheating or<br />\nsabotaging lab experiments and<br />\nhave not been expelled. The<br />\nlacrosse team must just sit back<br />\nand laugh to themselves when<br />\nthey see the stands full of<br />\nhypocrites, not only for their<br />\ngames but also for their scrimmages. If Saul Kravitz is so<br />\nconcerned with the reputation<br />\nof the Hopkins community, then<br />\nhe should check out some of the<br />\nunethical and dehumanized medical students being produced as a<br />\nresult of the intense academic<br />\npressures. If an agreement was<br />\nworked out by the coaches of<br />\nPenn and Hopkins it was obviously satisfactory to Penn or<br />\nthey would have pressed charges.<br />\nThe manner in which Coach<br />\nCiccarone disciplines his players<br />\nshould be left to his discretion<br />\n(in accordance with the athletic<br />\nHe has been<br />\ndepartment).<br />\nable to unify them into a nationally ranked team while constantly under surveillance and scrutiny. Coach Ciccarone should be<br />\npraised for his accomplishments<br />\nthus far, rather than ridiculed.<br />\nTheir reputation may proceed<br />\n<br />\nthem and granted you will not<br />\nfind haloes hanging over many<br />\nof the Lax players' heads, and<br />\nno one is condoning their<br />\nactions at Penn, but it was<br />\nhardly the crime of the century,<br />\nand the FBI wasn't even needed.<br />\nBesides just because they put on<br />\nthe same color shirts on Saturdays does not mean they are<br />\nchained together, to accuse and<br />\ndegrade an entire team for the<br />\nactions of a few is not only<br />\nunfair but ignorant.

I don't think it concerns<br />\nonly those who are involved in<br />\nthe immoral behavior, nor do I<br />\nthink it is a question of whether<br />\nphysical or psychological harm is<br />\nbeing inflicted on others.<br />\nThe whole question, I think,<br />\ncenters on what is really regarded as right or wrong by society<br />\nor by the general consensus.

After hours of<br />\ntelling Victor all about our Upper Voltan and<br />\nMalian adventures, we began to pack our bags for<br />\nthe next day's flight.

Both the<br />\nmen and the women fared very<br />\nwell, the women finishing sixteenth of 42, the men coming in<br />\nfifth of 75. The top six men's<br />\nteams were: Kenyon, repeating<br />\nas champion; Williams, St.<br />\nLawrence,<br />\nClaremont-Mudd,<br />\nHopkins, and Tufts. It was<br />\nHopkins' lowest finishever in<br />\nthis meet.<br />\nThe men's meet was extremely wide open, and is<br />\nexpected to get more unpredictable. Kenyon and Williams<br />\ndidn't win a single individual<br />\nevent; St. Lawrence won only<br />\none. Claremont-Mudd's finish<br />\nwas attributed to one swimmer<br />\ntaking three individual events.<br />\nOutstanding performers for JHU<br />\nwere Bill Bender, who was<br />\nsecond in the 400-meter individual medley, Mike Leonhardt,<br />\nwho finished second in the<br />\n200-meter freestyle; and Harvey<br />\nAllen, who placed second in the<br />\n200-meter breaststroke. During<br />\ntrials, Leonhardt set Blue Jay<br />\nrecords in the 200-meter freestyle and 100-meter freestyle<br />\nevents. Hopkins' only failing, if<br />\none must be sought, was that the<br />\n400-meter medley relay team<br />\n<br />\ndid not qualify for the finals.<br />\nOnly one other man in the MAC<br />\n(from Franklin and Marshall)<br />\nscored in the meet. The meet's<br />\nunpredictable character was epitomized by the fact that only<br />\none 1981 winner, in the onemeter diving event, repeated in<br />\n1982.<br />\nThe women competed in<br />\nthe first NCAA women's Division III National Finals. The top<br />\nfive<br />\nteams were Williams,<br />\nKenyon, Pomona-Ritzer (part of<br />\nthe same college system as<br />\nClaremont-Mudd); Smith; and<br />\nGettysburg, the MAC champion.<br />\nThe MAC was very strong, with<br />\nWestern Maryland and Franklin<br />\nand Marshall finishing in the top<br />\n12, and Hopkins in the sixteenth<br />\nspot.

But while one knows what to<br />\nexpect from the APL, it's a little distressing<br />\nto find other, supposedly more \"impartial\"<br />\nand \"academic\" branches of the University<br />\npaying their dues to special interests.<br />\nThis week the House of Delegates of<br />\nthe Maryland State Legislature passed a bill<br />\nthat would raise the ceiling on interest rates<br />\nto 24 percent throughout the entire state<br />\nlending industry. The bill, which is the<br />\nfinal compromise version of a series of<br />\nprevious bills, is a direct concession to<br />\nbanks in Maryland, a number of which have<br />\nalready shifted their credit operations to<br />\nother states where they can charge higher<br />\ninterest rates. The current interest rate<br />\nceiling in Maryland is between 12 and 18<br />\npercent, depending on the type of loan.<br />\nThe bill is still in committee in the<br />\nSenate, but if, as expected, it passes, a good<br />\nshare of the credit (pardon the expression)<br />\nbelongs to none other than the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Metro Center. A study<br />\nconducted by Metro Center staff economists, at the request of Governor Harry<br />\nHughes, led the Center to recommend the<br />\ncomplete lifting of all interest rate ceilings<br />\nin the state.<br />\nSome might question terming the<br />\nCenter's study a payment of its dues to the<br />\nbanking industry; after all, the study was<br />\nconducted by academics who were supposedly interested in finding out what is<br />\nbest for the people of Maryland. In isolation, this view sounds good, but two other<br />\nfactors undermine it severely:<br />\nthe<br />\n\"stacked\" membership of the Metro<br />\nCenter's recommendation committee, and<br />\nthe Center's history of biased studies.<br />\nThe Metro-Center's Task Force on<br />\nInterest Deregulation, the group which<br />\nmade the recommendations based on the<br />\nstudy, was made up almost entirely of<br />\nofficers of major banking concerns. Committee member Margie Muller, vicepresident of Union Trust Bank and the wife<br />\nof JHU president Steven Muller, is quoted<br />\non the front page of this issue as saying<br />\nthat \"it's perfectly normal\" for people to<br />\nquestion the membership of the committee. What she doesn't seem to realize is<br /><br />\nthat the membership of the committee<br />\ninvalidates both the Metro Center's claim<br />\nto acting as an academic institution and its<br />\nauthority as a source of recommendation.<br />\nIt may be that the actual study showed<br />\nthat the banks, if not placated, would shift<br />\ntheir operations and thus adversely effect<br />\ncustomers \u2014 but it was the members of the<br />\ntask force who recommended what to do<br />\non the basis of that information, and their<br />\nrecommendations clearly reflect their own<br />\nconcerns.<br />\nBesides, this is not the only time that<br />\n\u2022the Metro Center has been accused of bias<br />\nin its studies. Two years ago, it published<br />\na study which sought to determine whether<br />\nor not longtime, low-income residents in<br />\nSouth 9altimore neighborhoods were being<br />\ndisplaced by the new development and<br />\n\"gentrification\" of the city. The study<br />\nclaimed that displacement was going on at<br />\na rate of only two percent; its methodology<br />\nwas promptly attacked by journalists, city<br />\nplanners, and fellow academics, including<br />\nHopkins professor David Harvey. The<br />\nBaltimore Department of City Planning<br />\nregarded the study's evidence as so inconclusive that it promptly commissioned its<br />\nown study, which is still ongoing.<br />\nThus, the studies of the Metro<br />\nCenter may reflect a bias in methodology \u2014<br />\nthe present study on interest rate deregulation all but puts forth the actual recommendations made by the task force. One<br />\ndoes not like to charge the study's authors<br />\nwith bad motives, and one does not have<br />\nto: it may simply be that the Metro Center<br />\nchooses economists with a particular kind<br />\nof outlook, knowing that the methodology<br />\nthey will employ will ultimately support<br />\nthe Metro Center's business-oriented goals.<br />\nThere can be no question that the<br />\nMetro Center's studies are highly influential. The studies cannot be faulted for<br />\nwhat they say \u2014 perhaps interest rate<br />\nderegulation is the best answer -- but for<br />\nwho they say it on behalf of. The Center's<br />\ncontrolling membership is so ludicrously<br />\nstacked in favor of business that it can no<br />\nlonger be regarded as \"academically objective.\" Asking it for advice on consumer<br />\naffairs seems to be the same as asking the<br />\nAPL for recommendations on how to cut<br />\nthe defense budget.<br /><br />\nCover by<br />\nDana Gillian<br /><br />\nHonor The Faculty<br />\nBut Do It Right<br />\nBY MITCHELL D.

This is what<br />\nwins votes. I remember the<br />\ndisastrous results several years<br />\nago of a young Trustee candidate who distributed his photograph and biography in the mail<br />\nboxes: he ended up scattered all<br />\nover the floor, mustached and<br />\ndefaced. The answer is to<br />\nemploy a more utilitarian means<br />\nfor advertising candidates. Beer<br /><br />\ncompanies and rock groups<br />\nspread their names and faces<br />\nthroughout malls, schools, and<br />\ncity streets by a means that also<br />\nwould work for Student Council<br />\ncandidates: photo T-shirts and<br />\nparaphernalia.<br />\nThe shirts would show the<br />\ncandidate's face and name, and,<br />\nin addition, would reveal his or<br />\nher supporters. If you didn't<br />\npersonally know Grant Lally, for<br />\nexample, you might know someone who wore a Grant Lally<br />\nT-shirt. You would judge Danny<br />\nKao by seeing what kind of<br />\npeople wore his wind-breakers.<br />\nI would wear a Danny Kao<br />\nwind-breaker even after the<br />\nelection. It's trendy and fashionable to wear avante garde<br />\nparaphernalia. Soon, everyone<br />\nback home would want a Danny<br />\nKao wind-breaker. Remember<br />\nthe rise and spread of the<br />\nhula-hoop?<br />\nThis is one simple solution<br />\nof how to publicize Student<br />\nCouncil candidates.

These rumors were absolutely false and a sleazy attempt<br />\nto personally discredit me.

In a<br />\nschool as academically inclined<br />\nas Johns Hopkins it is both nice<br />\nand enjoyable to have some<br />\nnon-academic influences.<br />\nIt<br /><br />\nbrings a favorable facet to the<br />\nHopkins community which is<br />\nnot provided for anywhere else.<br />\nFor being a Division I championship team which is strongly<br />\nrecruited for their expertise in<br />\nlacrosse they do not receive all<br />\nthat much special attention.<br />\nThey don't eat steaks at a<br />\ntraining table like football players at Division I football powerhouses,and they are required to<br />\ntake 12 credits per semester at<br />\nHopkins. They are not untouchable; in fact they probably get<br />\ninto more trouble and are<br />\nwatched more carefully than any<br />\nother group of students. We<br />\nnever hear any complaints about<br />\nthe number of students who<br />\nhave been caught cheating or<br />\nsabotaging lab experiments and<br />\nhave not been expelled. The<br />\nlacrosse team must just sit back<br />\nand laugh to themselves when<br />\nthey see the stands full of<br />\nhypocrites, not only for their<br />\ngames but also for their scrimmages. If Saul Kravitz is so<br />\nconcerned with the reputation<br />\nof the Hopkins community, then<br />\nhe should check out some of the<br />\nunethical and dehumanized medical students being produced as a<br />\nresult of the intense academic<br />\npressures. If an agreement was<br />\nworked out by the coaches of<br />\nPenn and Hopkins it was obviously satisfactory to Penn or<br />\nthey would have pressed charges.<br />\nThe manner in which Coach<br />\nCiccarone disciplines his players<br />\nshould be left to his discretion<br />\n(in accordance with the athletic<br />\nHe has been<br />\ndepartment).<br />\nable to unify them into a nationally ranked team while constantly under surveillance and scrutiny.

I don't think it concerns<br />\nonly those who are involved in<br />\nthe immoral behavior, nor do I<br />\nthink it is a question of whether<br />\nphysical or psychological harm is<br />\nbeing inflicted on others.<br />\nThe whole question, I think,<br />\ncenters on what is really regarded as right or wrong by society<br />\nor by the general consensus. If a<br />\nsociety condones permissiveness<br />\nand prostitution or stippers<br />\nto that effect, then probably<br />\nsuch behavior is not immoral<br />\nwhen regarded in such a context.<br />\nPeople may argue for this and<br />\nsay that sexual desire is a natural<br />\nphenomenon. It is therefore<br />\nnot bad or wrong. Some people<br />\nmay find the desire, so pleasurable that they need to be pampered and catered for. In a<br />\nconsumer-oriented world, where<br />\nservice is the word and profit is<br />\nthe goal, it is hard to imagine<br />\nthat somebody will not try to<br />\ntake advantage of the situation.<br />\nBesides, there will be more jobs.<br />\nAnd, who knows, it may be<br />\ngood for the economy, too.<br />\nWell, many people seem to have<br />\na good time and only a few<br />\npeople are actually physically or<br />\nmentally hurt. Besides, these<br />\npeople may enjoy being hurt.<br />\nThey asked for it or they deserved it, depending on how you<br />\nwant to look at it. And, of<br />\ncourse, one should not forget<br />\nthat they have their rights, and I<br />\nguess, everyone should respect<br />\nwhat they want to do or how<br />\nthey want to do it.<br /><br />\nPersonally, I don't know if<br />\nsuch<br />\na society can exist, and if it<br />\nWe're On \"Fo You<br />\ndoes exist, I don't know if<br />\nit is fit for any sensible, decent<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nhuman being.

Steve Hand (0-2,<br />\n5.41 ERA) pitched a strong<br />\ngame, one in which Hopkins<br />\njumped out to a one-run lead<br />\nwith an unearned run scored by<br />\nthird baseman Bobby Cardwell.<br />\nbut in the bottom of the third,<br />\nthe Hoyas scored four runs on<br />\ntwo \"seeing-eye\" singles with<br />\nthe bases loaded.<br />\nThe Jays cut the deficit to<br />\n4-2 in the fifth when a Georgetown outfielder dropped a fly<br />\nball and Bobby Cardwell ended<br />\nup on second base, from which<br />\nhe was driven home by a Whitney Burke single.<br />\nHopkins yielded another<br />\nrun in the seventh when leftfielder Burke misplayed a flyball<br />\nand first baseman Bob Martino<br />\ncommitted a throwing error.<br />\nSingles by Randy Greehan<br />\nand Martino allowed Hopkins to<br />\nget one back in the eighth, but<br />\nshabby defense in the top of the<br />\nninth did in the Jays. An error<br />\nby first baseman Martino on a<br />\nthrow from second baseman<br />\nAndy Lachance allowed the<br />\nHoyas to score three unearned<br />\nruns and take an 8-3 lead into<br />\nthe bottom of the ninth.<br /><br />\nHopkins refused to give up,<br />\ntaking advantage of three<br />\nGeorgetown errors, two walks<br />\nand a wild pitch to score three<br />\nruns. But the game ended with<br />\ntwo men on for the Jays, as they<br />\ncame up two runs short, losing<br />\nby a score of 8-6.<br />\nThe Georgetown game has<br />\nbeen typical of Hopkins play<br />\nthis season, which opened on<br />\nThursday, March 16 with a 14-0<br />\nloss to a strong UMBC team.<br />\nCoach Babb calls this the worst<br />\ngame he has ever seen Hopkins<br />\nplay.<br />\nThings took a turn for the<br />\nbetter the following day when<br />\nthe Jays won a pair from Coppin<br />\nState, 10-3 and 11-2, getting<br />\nstrong pitching from Jeff Comen<br />\nand Dave Provost.<br />\nAfter the doubleheader, the<br />\nteam headed to Florida, playing<br />\nfive games during the week of<br />\nspring break, winning one,losing<br />\nthree and tying another.<br />\nThe first game in Melbourne<br />\nagainst Wooster of Ohio had to<br />\nbe called after nine innings with<br />\nthe score 4-4.

Two<br />\nruns in the fifth and four runs<br />\nin the sixth broke open a 3-3 tie<br />\nin the nightcap.<br />\nThus far the early season<br />\nperformance of the Blue Jays<br />\nhas been very disappointing.<br />\nThe team has been making errors<br />\non the routine plays.<br />\nAnd<br />\nfalling behind early in games has<br />\ntaken away opportunities for the<br />\nJays to play aggressively. The<br />\nsquad also has not hit well, and<br />\nthe team batting average is<br />\na meager .244.<br />\nOne factor that has greatly<br />\nhurt the Blue Jays is an injury to<br />\ncaptain and starting shortstop<br />\nBill Stromberg.

It could be said that<br />\nthe Baltimore Orioles have a bit<br />\nof redeeming to do themselves,<br />\nfor last season Earl Weaver's<br />\ncrew never seemed to play up to<br />\ntheir potential, a potential they<br />\nwill have to realize if they hope<br />\nto win the American League's<br />\nEast Division, arguably the most<br />\ncompetitive division in baseball.<br /><br />\nHowever, the Orioles figure<br />\nto fly higher this year. There is<br />\nsimply too much talent on<br />\nthe squad to discount the team.<br />\nThe Orioles' strong suit is<br />\npitching, and the staff should<br />\nperform better than it did last<br /><br />\nyear.

Third base is<br />\nbeing handed to the touted Cal<br />\nRipken, Jr., who some criticize<br />\nas a phenomenal bust in 1981,<br />\nhis first year in the majors. But<br />\nno player can be judged on the<br />\nbasis of all of 39 at-bats,<br />\nRipken's composite total last<br />\nyear. He has battered every<br />\nother organized league that he<br />\nhas ever been in, and unless a lot<br />\nof respected baseball minds are<br />\nwrong, will mature into a solid,<br />\npossibly spectacular, pro. Experienced infield depth on the<br />\nOrioles, however, is virtually<br />\nnon-existent, and if Ripken<br />\ndoes not perform, or gets<br />\ninjured, it could prove disastrous<br />\nfor the Birds' pennant chances.<br /><br />\nSwimmers Vie For Titles<br />\nBY JAY SCHNEIDER<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Swimming and diving teams sent<br />\nrepresentatives to the Division<br />\nIII National Finals March 18-20<br />\nat Washington and Lee in<br />\nLexington, Virginia. Both the<br />\nmen and the women fared very<br />\nwell, the women finishing sixteenth of 42, the men coming in<br />\nfifth of 75. The top six men's<br />\nteams were: Kenyon, repeating<br />\nas champion; Williams, St.<br />\nLawrence,<br />\nClaremont-Mudd,<br />\nHopkins, and Tufts. It was<br />\nHopkins' lowest finishever in<br />\nthis meet.<br />\nThe men's meet was extremely wide open, and is<br />\nexpected to get more unpredictable. Kenyon and Williams<br />\ndidn't win a single individual<br />\nevent; St. Lawrence won only<br />\none. Claremont-Mudd's finish<br />\nwas attributed to one swimmer<br />\ntaking three individual events.<br />\nOutstanding performers for JHU<br />\nwere Bill Bender, who was<br />\nsecond in the 400-meter individual medley, Mike Leonhardt,<br />\nwho finished second in the<br />\n200-meter freestyle; and Harvey<br />\nAllen, who placed second in the<br />\n200-meter breaststroke. During<br />\ntrials, Leonhardt set Blue Jay<br />\nrecords in the 200-meter freestyle and 100-meter freestyle<br />\nevents. Hopkins' only failing, if<br />\none must be sought, was that the<br />\n400-meter medley relay team<br /><br />\ndid not qualify for the finals.<br />\nOnly one other man in the MAC<br />\n(from Franklin and Marshall)<br />\nscored in the meet. The meet's<br />\nunpredictable character was epitomized by the fact that only<br />\none 1981 winner, in the onemeter diving event, repeated in<br />\n1982.<br />\nThe women competed in<br />\nthe first NCAA women's Division III National Finals. The top<br />\nfive<br />\nteams were Williams,<br />\nKenyon, Pomona-Ritzer (part of<br />\nthe same college system as<br />\nClaremont-Mudd); Smith; and<br />\nGettysburg, the MAC champion.<br />\nThe MAC was very strong, with<br />\nWestern Maryland and Franklin<br />\nand Marshall finishing in the top<br />\n12, and Hopkins in the sixteenth<br />\nspot. The Blue Jays swam well,<br />\nespecially Heather Dick. All of<br />\nher times were a season beat,<br />\nand all of the times, except the<br />\n1650-meter freestyle, were her<br />\nlifetime best. This being the<br />\nfirst year of this championship,<br />\nthe meet is expected to grow,<br />\nand coach Tim Welsh hopes that<br />\nJHU's contingient at the meet<br />\nwill increase with it.<br />\nWelsh is looking forward to<br />\na strong recruiting year. An excellent crop of freshmen,<br />\ncoupled with the fact that<br />\nno women and only two men<br />\nwill graduate from the national teams, could produce an even<br />\nmore competitive and exciting<br />\nteam than this year's squad.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 23<br /><br />\nCampus Notes<br />\nThere will be a discussion of Does<br />\nScience Give a Religious Context?<br />\nWednesday, April 7, at 7:30 p.m. in<br />\nGilmam 38.
