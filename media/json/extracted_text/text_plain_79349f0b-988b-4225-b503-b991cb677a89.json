Shriver could<br />\npull a similar act, only billed as the rich<br />\nman's Humphrey. Aside from the<br />\nshrillness, what did Sarge have to say?<br />\nWell, he started by pointing out the<br />\nlong and distinguished history of his<br />\nfamily in Maryland: his ancestor, David<br />\nShriver, served in the Stamp Act Congress<br />\nand was a friend of Charles Carroll of<br />\nCarrollton, signer of the Declaration of<br />\nIndependence and a fellow wealthy<br />\nCatholic enlightened landlord; another<br />\nrelative, Andrew Shriver, President of the<br />\nMaryland Bar Association, donated Shriver<br />\nHall to the University\u2014and don't you<br />\nforget it. His relative recital probably<br />\nturned a lot of people off, but Shriver is<br />\nirrepressible. Nothing gets the man down.<br />\nWho else would once again foist himself<br />\non the American electorate after the<br />\ntrouncing he received with St. George in<br />\n1972. Shriver has never been elected to<br />\nany office; he overcompensates for this<br />\nfact by boasting that he is a manger, an<br />\nexecutive. He told his audience that he<br />\nwould make a lousy Senator or<br />\n<br />\nCongressman, but that the Presidency was<br />\nthe right job for him. He stressed his<br />\ndiplomatic career as Ambassador to<br />\nFrance and his administrative experience<br />\nas Director of the Peace Corps and head of<br />\nO.E.O. as suitable qualifications for the<br />\nPresidency. His answers to the questions<br />\nposed by, the panel (after a ten-minute<br />\nopening statement, each candidate was<br />\ngrilled for a half hour by a panel of local<br />\npoliticos, labor leaders, A.D.A. activists,<br />\netc., after which selected written questions<br />\nfrom the audience were tackled) were<br />\nbuoyantly optimistic, rambling non<br />\nsequiturs. It amazes me that anyone takes<br />\nShriver's candidacy seriously, especially so<br />\nsavvy a politician as Baltimore City<br />\nCouncil.

It continues as such now with FY<br />\n1973-74 expenditures of $90 million. In<br />\n1966 the APL devoted 8 per cent of its<br />\nbudget to non-war applications. This has<br />\nincreased and APL now devotes 20 per<br />\ncent of its budget to these programs.<br />\nHowever, the primary mission of the<br />\nAPL, as a Federal Contract Research<br />\nCenter, remains the application of<br />\nadvanced science and technology to<br />\nproblems of sophisticated warfare.<br />\nThe Committee for Conversion has<br />\nalready begun its non-violent campaign<br />\nwith letters to the University's senior<br />\nadministrators and Trustees who are<br />\nresponsible for APL's relationship with the<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nThe Committee has based its campaign<br />\nin part on the assertion that nuclear<br />\nweapons can never be used morally, that<br />\nsuch weapons should therefore not exist<br />\n<br />\nand that no one, certainly not university<br />\npeople, should contribute to nuclear<br />\nweapons research and development.<br />\nThe campaign is also based on the work<br />\nof Professor Seymour Melman of<br />\nColumbia University. He has suggested<br />\nthat changing the use of labor and other<br />\nresearch and production resources form<br />\nmilitary to civilian purposes is desirable so<br />\nthat we may evaluate security problems on<br />\ntheir merits alone and not diffuse this<br />\nissue with considerations of livelihood and<br />\neconomic well-being for labor forces,<br />\nindustries, universities, etc.<br />\nHe also has noted that military<br />\neconomic activity, while contributing<br />\nwages and salaries to persons involved,<br />\nyields products that exit from the<br />\nmarketplace upon being produced. These<br />\nproducts are not part of the current level<br />\nof living, except insofar as tbey contribute<br />\nto inflation.<br />\nPreliminary discussions with University<br />\nofficials suggest that to its credit, the<br />\nAPL has never refused a contract to<br />\nperform non-military work. However, they<br />\nindicated that currently available funds for<br />\nnon-war work are insufficient to maintain<br />\nan efficiently functioning lab.<br />\nConsequently, without the APL's research<br />\nand development of weapons, there would<br />\nbe no work in the fields of transportation,<br />\nbiomedical engineering or civilian air<br />\ntraffic control there.<br />\nFinally, the officers replied that Johns<br />\nHopkins' contributions to U.S. military<br />\nweapons programs are quite appropriate<br />\ngiven present international relationships<br />\nwhich make unilateral disarmament<br />\nundesirable.<br />\nThe Committee will continue to<br />\ncommunicate with University<br />\nadministrators and with workers at APL.<br />\nThey hope, too, that the broader issues of<br />\nthe debate and the APL's current work<br />\nwill stimulate thoughtful action by the<br />\nlarger University community.<br />\nIt is altogether appropriate that Johns<br />\nHopkins, celebrating its centennial as a<br />\nleader in the American educational<br />\ncommunity, should terminate its wasteful<br />\nassociation with the forces of war and<br />\nre-dedicate itself to that creative search for<br />\ntruth for which it was founded.<br />\n<br />\ngreat cocktail parties in Paris, but he<br />\nremains a personable man of whom it may<br />\nbe said: Deep down, he's shallow.<br />\nTerry Sanford, fomer governor of North<br />\nCarolina and presently President of Duke<br />\nUniversity, was the least impressive<br />\ncandidate. A friend of mine labelled him<br />\n\"a southern-fried Steven Muller\"\u2014but that<br />\ndoes Muller a great injustice. Sanford, a<br />\n\"moderate\" who promised to stop George<br />\nWallace from gaining ground in the South,<br />\nopposes busing. His own educational<br />\nreform scheme is strangely reminiscent<br />\nof the \"separate but equal\" doctrine laid<br />\ndown by the Supreme Court in 1896.<br />\nSanford maintained that the chief reason<br />\nbehind judicial sanctioning of busing was<br />\nthat Dr. James S. Coleman thought it<br />\nmight be a good idea. Now that Dr.<br />\nColeman has changed his mind, there<br />\nremains no justification to bus. (This is<br />\nextraordinary reasoning on Sanford's part.<br />\nI never realized, when I went to junior<br />\nhigh school with his son and played board<br />\ngames designed by him, that this one man,<br />\nColeman, had such great power over the<br />\nnation's judicial minds!) Sanford wants to<br />\ndo away with the present welfare system<br />\nand promises to hold a \"valley<br />\nconference\" (his pun on summit) to<br />\ndiscuss alternatives to the present mess<br />\nwith leading economists. The early<br />\nmorning audience, surfeited with his<br />\nplatitudes, reacted apathetically to Gov.<br />\nSanford. Some of Sanford's job programs<br />\nduring his term as North Carolina's<br />\ngovernor are considered to be the<br />\nforerunners of the War on Poverty of the<br />\nJohnson years. The Governor took much<br />\ncredit for this. Why is it that Sanford (and<br />\nShriver, too, for that manner) speak of the<br />\n\"great accomplishments\" of the Johnson<br />\nadministration when many astute critics<br />\nhave written his Great Society off as a<br />\nfiasco accomplishing little more than<br />\ncreating jobs for more bureaucrats and<br />\nincreasing inflation?

Harris, apostle of the New<br />\nPopulism (which is like the Old Populism,<br />\nsans racist undercurrent), maintained in<br />\nhis book of that name, that McGovern lost<br />\nthe election because he 'didn't emphasize<br />\n\"the people's issues\" hard enough and<br />\nseemed not to know his own mind.

The Indiana<br />\nSenator comes across as an evangelist, but<br />\nhe also tends to be over-cautious; perhaps<br />\nhis careful vacillations prove that he has<br />\nalready internalized the role of President.<br />\nFinally, Fred Harris proved to be too<br />\ntough an act for Bayh to follow.

Only in a small portion of the<br />\ncontinent will you see wildlife, a la \"Born<br />\nFree\".(And there are no tigers in Africa.)<br />\nNone of the 'natives' I met had spears.<br />\nInstead, I met a warm people in a country<br />\ncalled Ghana (formally the Gold Coast),<br />\nWest Africa. I'm convinced after my nine<br />\nmonth stay in Ghana that I felt more at<br />\nhome there than any Ghanaian could ever<br />\nfeel at home in a country as 'civilized' as<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nGhanaians, as do many people of the<br />\nso-called 'third', or poor world have a lot<br />\nto teach us about being human. We might<br />\nPrefer to regard these people as'backward'<br />\nOr 'primitive',<br />\nbut in doing so we are<br />\nlimiting our own perspectives. Ghanaians<br />\nhave so little in the way of 'things' yet<br />\ntheir culture is rich. The way people go<br />\nabout their lives is indeed very basic, and<br />\nin a sense more sane andmeaningful than<br />\n<br />\nthe way we live ours. The beauty of simple<br />\nthings abounds in tropical West Africa,<br />\nwalking especially. For the mass of the<br />\npeople things still happen slowly in this<br />\npart of the world and the best way to see<br />\nwhat is happening is on foot, not through<br />\nthe windshield of a speeding car. Often I'd<br />\n1<br />\n4<br />\nwalk around Accra, a bustling city of /<br />\nmillion people, and invariably I was<br />\ncaptured by the dizziness and beauty of it<br />\nall. I'd weave my way through crowded<br />\nand colorful markets where the 'mammies'<br />\n<br />\nre<br />\n<br />\nLa<br />\n<br />\n3t<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nOld Women in Traditional at an Annual Festival<br />\n<br />\nFriends in a Coastal Fishing Village<br />\n(women traders) each sold their own line<br />\nof goods, whether it be fabric, pots and<br />\npans, canned goods, or tobacco goods.<br />\nSometimes I'd stop and chat until my<br />\nlimited knowledge of Twi (one of the<br />\nseveral main languages spoken in Ghana)<br />\nwas expended. Moving on with smiles I'd<br />\nfeel fine about talking to some average<br />\nfolks who were just doing like me, living<br />\ntheir lives.<br />\nContrasted with the fast-pace action of<br />\nAccra, was the tranquility of some small<br />\nvillages I visited. Often on Sundays I<br />\nwould walk about two miles to a friend's<br />\nvillage where we would relax and enjoy<br />\nthe late afternoon drumming. Sunday is a<br />\nheavy day for drumming in Ghana, and it<br />\ncertainly comes off as a bit more spiritual<br />\nand powerful than watching a football<br />\ngame on T.V. Village life is no picnic.<br />\nSurely people would like electricity and<br />\nrunning water in their homes, but they<br />\nrealize that change is slow. They live their<br />\nlives as best they can. I was always struck<br />\nby the resourcefulness of Ghanaians. From<br />\nour perspective they get by with so little,<br />\nbut in a sense this only brings home the<br />\nillusion that to have more 'things' is<br />\nnecessarily good, that 'things' rather than<br />\npeople are what's important, an illusion<br />\nwhich has saturated our mode of life.<br />\nGhana was in people, not things. When<br />\nyou don't have a lot it has to be that way.<br />\n<br />\nPhotos by Jon Krasnoff<br />\n<br />\nYoung Girl in Traditional Garb<br />\n<br />\nWho knows what lurks beneath the freshman dorms?<br />\nBy BETH KALIKOFF<br />\nI'm going to tell you a minor-league,<br />\nluke-warm secret. There is a radio station<br />\non this campus. The name of the station is<br />\nWJHU and it is located deep in the bowels<br />\nof the freshman dorms.Doiyou know that?<br />\nNow you do, and if you tell someone else,<br />\nthat will make three of us.<br />\nDJ<br />\nThe aspiring DJ sets out for WJHU with<br />\nhigh hopes of becoming a vital component<br />\nof a. expensive but well-oiled piece of<br />\nmachinery, enough to have\u2014o holy of<br />\nholies\u2014one's own show, just being around<br />\nall those pros, soaking up the<br />\nexpertise\u2014how rewarding it will be! The<br />\nfledgling DJ is somewhat dashed to<br />\ndiscover that the station of those innocent<br />\ndreams is a closet-like cubicle with the<br />\ntemperature of a sauna, inches away from<br />\nWashers sloshing in the laundry room. The<br />\nWalls are covered with aging posters of<br />\naging rock stars; the floor sports a<br />\ndisheartening layer of year-old Billboard<br />\nmagazines and human fingernails. The<br />\nmachinery, although not any older than<br />\nthe Civil War, is certainly not a:iy younger.<br />\n<br />\nIn short, the station is, at first look, a<br />\ndisappointment.<br />\nThe would-be DJ takes a deep<br />\nbreath\u2014wisely, from the hall\u2014and<br />\nvaliantly switches mental gears,<br />\nsubstituting actual station for station of<br />\ndreams. After all, it's the impact that<br />\ncounts, not the setting. What though the<br />\ndecor is unpleasing to the eye? Do you<br />\nrespect the values of House Beautiful?<br />\nThink of that'devoted following that isn't<br />\nfollowing yet, but will be.. It is at that<br />\npoint that the slightly willing but ever<br />\nhopeful DJ learns the worst: a person can<br />\nnot listentoWJHU unless he/she lives in the<br />\ndorms or is doing laundry in the dorms,<br />\nbecause of the station's:small output of<br />\npower.<br />\nMajor Problem<br />\nYou and I see that this creates a<br />\nproblem for the once-enthusiastic youth, a<br />\nrather major problem. Surrounded by<br />\ndeteriorating machinery and a record file<br />\ncontaining the largest Frank Sinatra<br />\ncollection known to exist on a college<br />\ncampus, the DJ is confronted with the fact<br />\nthat almost no one 'actually listens to<br />\n<br />\nlikes. He can ignore the mike altogether<br />\nWJHU, at least on purpose. Sometimes<br />\nand enjoy three hours of music without<br />\nwhen freshmen wash %.heir socks, they can't<br />\nhearing a human voice. The isolation can<br />\nhelp it.

But a radio<br />\nworthwhile<br />\nbeen<br />\npathos.<br />\nHe<br />\nsuckers<br />\nfor<br />\nare<br />\nthose of us who<br />\nstation is not only for the private<br />\ncan try to stimulate interest through<br />\nenjoyment of the DJ, but the pleasure of<br />\nadvertising. He can abandon all dignity and<br />\nthe listening public. One of WJHU's late<br />\nbeg friends within listening<br />\nnight voices has put a sign on the station<br />\ndistance\u2014nodding acquaintances, for that<br />\ndoor. It says: A Man Without Religion is<br />\nmatter\u2014to tune in to his show. He can<br />\nlike a Fish Without a Bicycle. Whether<br />\nwrite his Senator. He can make the<br />\nelectricity stronger. We can see where this ' that is valid or not, certainly a radio<br />\nstation without a listening audience is<br />\nis leading us, can't we? This way lies<br />\npointless. Ironically, in the last few days,<br />\nmadness, although I'd be the last to say<br />\nwhat feeble activity there is at WJHU has<br />\nthat wasn't a solution.<br />\nto a halt. The station is broken and<br />\nground<br />\nThere are advantages to the final<br />\nthe Ills have temporarily stopped talking<br />\nalternative: doing a show with no listeners<br />\nto themselves. But, take heart, indifferent<br />\nand enjoying yourself. As far as the<br />\nnon-listeners.

Then, according to<br />\nJohn B. Quixton's excellent The Carroll<br />\nCadre (The New Channak Press; 1937),<br />\n\"The old man paused and gazed at the<br />\nBenedictine crucifix above the mantlepiece.<br />\nSuddenly he raised his cane and brought it<br />\ntrashing down against the floor. 'The<br />\nwrath of God shall descend upon ye, my<br />\nson, and a blight will settle sooner on ye<br />\nland,' whereupon Charles Jr. rose from the<br />\nwindowseat and walked out of the manor<br />\nnever to return.\"<br />\nAfter two years of remorse and<br />\n<br />\nCarroll Exhibit<br />\nbrow-beating by his daughter, Charles<br />\nfinally relented and journeyed to<br />\nBaltimore from his palatial Howard<br />\nCounty estate, Doughoregan Manor. He<br />\nfound his son living in a run-down<br />\nrowhouse and with the words,\"Mercy and<br />\nforgiveness are a man's commandments,\"<br />\nhe bought several hundred acres of<br />\n<br />\nCSN&Y record albums<br />\nBy JOHN HOLDREN<br />\nIf you are one of those faithful of<br />\nCrosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, from way<br />\nback when, then you've probably found<br />\nyour pocket money dwindling lately, since<br />\nall the boys have released individual<br />\nefforts in the past few months. As for<br />\nmyself, I feel gypped in at least two out of<br />\nthree purchases. The new Crosby-Nash<br />\ncollaboration, Wind on the Water, is<br />\nrecycled mishmash. It must be that Messrs.<br />\nDavid and Graham feel fleeting youth<br />\nslipping from their gasp (alas!), for, with<br />\nall the subtlety of a pile-driver, they seem<br />\nto be attempting to make their music have<br />\nsome kind of lasting artistic and social<br />\nsignificance. It doesn't work. They employ<br />\nsome o f the finest studio musiciarfs<br />\navailable, who, despite their talents,<br />\ncannot help but sound a bit put off, if not<br />\nbored, by all this pretentiousness. Crosby<br />\nblunders embarrassingly in thinking that<br />\nmaking a literary allusion equals being<br />\n\"poetic,\" e.g.: \"How could Samson / I<br />\nthought he was blind as a bat! How could<br />\nhe have torn down / a temple like that?\"<br />\nAs if that weren't enough, we get, just<br />\nwhat we need, another save-the-whale<br />\necology song. Singing about whales is not,<br />\ndammit, going to save any, nor is it going<br />\nto inspire your average record buyer to<br />\nrush out and strike down some Japanese<br />\nAhab with his atomic harpoon. Previous<br />\nCrosby and Nash solo albums or<br />\ncollaborations all had a lot going for them:<br />\nthis one just sputters.<br />\nAs for Stephen Stills' new album<br />\n(entitled, gee, that's funny, Stills), I have<br />\nno one but myself to blame for wasting<br />\nmy money on it. His earlier efforts<br />\ndictated that this most recent one would<br />\nbe just another monomaniac ego-show,<br />\nand, yes, it is. A friend of mine lauds the<br />\nalbum for \"precision,\" but then again, he<br />\nalso gets a charge out listening to accutron<br />\nwatches.<br />\nSo that leaves us with Neil Young, and<br />\nthat's wfio I really want to talk about. His new<br />\nalbum,. just out, comes only a few months<br />\nafter his release of the Degenerate Album<br />\nof the Year, Tonight's the Night,<br />\nwhich\u2014despite the fact that it initially<br />\nSounds/like something you would record<br />\nafter pulling a week; (at least) of<br />\nall-fighters\u2014I find to be one of the most<br />\ninteresting and (if there is such a thing)<br />\nsignificant rock albums in a long time. In<br />\nit, Young reveals that starkly candid side<br />\nof a performer we so rarely see: or wait a<br />\nminute, is it just another part of a big<br />\n<br />\nperformance? If you can keep yourself<br />\nfrom turning it off, you'll inevitably start<br />\nto flow with it. Listen to it at least once,<br />\njust to catch those amazing lines that<br />\nweird Neil Young can get away with, while<br />\nthey would sound like ridiculously puerile<br />\nattempts at freakiness if Stills or the other<br />\nguys tried to pull them off. For example:<br />\n\"I'm singing this borrowed tune /1 took<br />\nfrom the Rolling Stones / Alone in this<br />\nempty room / Too wasted to write my<br />\nown;\" or, on the lighter side, \"I'm not<br />\n.going back to Woodstock for awhile I<br />\nThough I long to hear that lonesome<br />\nhippie smile.\" Such lines should be heard,<br />\nhowever, not read, for in Young's, er,<br />\nunique voice lies much of their effect.<br />\nNeil Young ,<br />\nNeil Young's brand new album is called<br />\nZuma. The title, if you're wondering, is an<br />\nabridgement of the name Montezuma, the<br />\nlast chieftain, of the Aztec tribe laid to<br />\nwaste by Cortez, whose achievement<br />\nYoung puts in perspective in his song,<br />\n\"Cortez the Killer.\" Before listening to<br />\nthis album, you should give the cover a<br />\ngood once-over. It has all the artistic merit<br />\nof a footprint. A weird black-and-white<br />\ndesert scene is depicted, with, not at all<br />\nsubtly, various cacti assuming the shape<br />\nyour hand takes when you wish to indicate<br />\nto that obnoxious someone,just what you<br />\ncan do, buddy. The cover seems almost a<br />\nsnide retort to those of the new Stills and<br />\nCrosby-Nash albums, which shine with all<br />\ntoo glossy photos of our heroes.<br />\nOne electric number,, \"Stupid Girl,\" gives<br />\na new twist to the love song, and features<br />\nsuch curious compliments as \"You're such<br />\na beautiful fish / Flopping in the summer<br />\nsand\" (but flattery will get you nowhere).<br />\nThe album's quiet songs are what really<br />\nstand out. The boys in the band do some<br />\nhauntingly effective backup singing, rather<br />\nchanting, on a very nice piece, \"Pardon<br />\nMy Heart.\" CSN&Y fans should pick up<br />\nthis album if for nothing else than the last<br />\nsong, \"Through My Sails,\" an acoustic<br />\nballad that reunites the four for a striking<br />\none-shot effect that hints where they<br />\ncould have gone had they not disbanded.<br />\nSince Young is at the helm, the song<br />\nsuffers from none of the studio overkill<br />\nthat so greatly weakened Deja Vu. If,<br />\nworking together, all four can produce<br />\nsongs of such quality, then I can only<br />\nimpatiently hope that they get together<br />\nfor one more extended try. In the<br />\nmeantime, Zuma can keep me, and maybe<br />\nyou, plenty entertained.<br />\n<br />\nwooded farmland north of Baltimore town<br />\nfor his son and financed the building of<br />\nwhat now is disguised as Homewood<br />\nHouse, the Barn Theatre, and that curious<br />\nlittle building between the old dorms'and<br />\nthe house called, in 19th century terms,<br />\nthe \"necessary.\"<br />\nWhen Homewood House was<br />\ncompleted, Carroll exclaimed, \"Mine eyes<br />\nhave yet to see a more gracious house in<br />\nthe colonies.\" And Quixton rightly notes,<br />\n\"Homewood House is perhaps the best<br />\nexample of Georgian architecture still in<br />\nexistence.\" Last year, the government<br />\ndesignated Homewood House as a federal<br />\nlandmark and plans are being made to<br />\nmake the house a museum.<br />\nSigning the Declaration of Independence<br />\nIn 1776, Carroll sojourned to<br />\nPhiladelphia, the capital of the colonies, to<br />\nparticipate as Maryland's delegate to the<br />\nContinental Congress. His role at the<br />\nCongress was that of an arbitrator between<br />\nthe various geographical factions. Carroll<br />\nwas the second man (preceeded only by<br />\nJohn Hancock) to sign the Declaration. He<br />\nspoke these prophetic words on the day<br />\nbefore, \"The dawn is overcast, ye morning<br />\nlowers and heavily brings on ye day bign<br />\nwith ye fate of Liberty.\"<br />\nIn The Field Of Foreign;Affairs<br />\nLater in 1776, Carroll, along with Ben<br />\nFranklin and financier Samuel Chase,<br />\ntravelled to Canada to seek an alliance<br />\n<br />\nwith other dissatisfied British subjects.<br />\nLittle is known of this unsuccessful<br />\nadventure except for this cryptic remark'<br />\nfrom Carroll's journal, \"What savage<br />\npractices these Canucks engage<br />\nthemselves!\"<br />\nIn Government<br />\nOn December 12, 1788, the Maryland<br />\nHouse of Delegates elected John Henry and<br />\nCharles Carroll to be the first United<br />\nStates Senators from Maryland. On<br />\nSeptember 23, 1791, Charles Carroll was<br />\nelected Maryland State Senator. On<br />\nNovember 5, 1792, the Maryland<br />\nlegislature passed a bill that prohibits<br />\nholding simultaneous seats in the Federal<br />\nand State legislatures. Carroll resigned his<br />\nseat in Washington saying,\"A humble man<br />\nhas a humble job.\"<br />\nGlory And The Shrewd Businessman<br />\nOn July 4, 1826, the day both John<br />\nAdams and Thomas Jefferson died,<br />\nCharles Carroll became the last surviving<br />\nsigner of the Declaration of Independence.<br />\nIn 1828, Carroll undertook his most<br />\nambitious investment, the founding of the<br />\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad. This was<br />\nadded to his already vast business holdings<br />\nwhich lead Quixton to write, \"One can<br />\nnot help but wonder if Carroll's interest in<br />\nthe Revolution was something more than<br />\njust freedom.\" Carroll never did see the<br />\nB&O become a success; he died quietly in<br />\nhis sleep on November 14, 1832.<br />\n<br />\nEden Express<br />\n<br />\nVonnegut relives insanity<br />\nBy MICHAEL BELLOW<br />\nIf you want to find out how a<br />\nschizophrenic person thinks and acts, the<br />\nbest thing to do would be to go nuts<br />\nyourself. Not exactly relishing that<br />\nprospect, a second alternative is available,<br />\nMark Vonnegut's recently published book,<br />\nThe Eden Express, in which the son of a<br />\nfavorite artist-in-words recounts his bout<br />\nwith insanity.<br />\nMark Vonnegut, a member of the class<br />\nof 1969 at Swarthmore College, graduated<br />\nwith the feeling that life was not going his<br />\nway on the East Coast. After a year of<br />\nunrewarding work, he set out for British<br />\nColumbia, Canada, with the intention of<br />\nstarting a utopian hippie community.<br />\nAfter setting up a farm along with<br />\nseveral friends in the unsoiled wilderness<br />\nwhere he had purchased his land, Mark<br />\nbegan to feel the peculiar sensations of<br />\nliving in \"Eden\"\u2014the beauty of the<br />\nsurroundings, detachment from hectic life,<br />\nand sense of closeness to the others.<br />\nHowever, he soon could not control his<br />\nthousand-mile-an-hour thoughts and<br />\ninsatiable desire to be understood by all<br />\nthose around him. On trips away from the<br />\nfarm, he was unable to function<br />\nnormally\u2014\"Just getting back to the farm<br />\nwhere things made sense became<br />\neverything.\" Mark lost his ability to eat or<br />\nsleep and his weight decreased drastitally.<br />\nAt last, with great reluctance, he was<br />\nplaced 'in a psychiatric hospital.<br />\nRepulsed by the atmosphere of the nut<br />\nhouse, Mark succeeded in getting himself<br />\nreleased before he was completely cured.<br />\nBack in the hospital again after<br />\nsuccumbing to a drug orgy, he now<br />\nsubmitted faithfully to the prescribed<br />\ntreatment and was successfully cured.<br />\nFeeling well and capable of handling life<br />\noutside of the farm, Mark went back East,<br />\nwhere he is now applying himself toward<br />\neducational pursuits.<br />\nVonnegut describes graphically the life<br />\nof the farm\u2014we see its ups and downs,<br />\nvirtues and flaws. Each character is<br />\ndistinctly portrayed\u2014Virginia, with whom<br />\n<br />\nMark has a passionless but enduring love<br />\naffair; Simon, the practical bulwark; and<br />\nothers. But Vonnegut's major intent is the<br />\npersonal recollections of a schizophrenic<br />\nexperience, and in this he certainlY<br />\nsucceeds. Much is left vague; many aspects<br />\nof his experience cannot be recounted or<br />\ndescribed.<br />\nIn spite of the difficulty of putting such<br />\nphenomena into words, The Eden Express<br />\nis not really a difficult book. Mark seems<br />\nto have his father's talent for giving<br />\neffective expression to eccentric<br />\nexperience. He can recall and relate manY<br />\nof the thoughts which raced through his<br />\nmind, and make us understand if not<br />\nappreciate them. In the final analysis.<br />\nVonnegut rejects the belief that<br />\nschizophrenia requires a \"poetic\" cure and<br />\nrecommends orthomolecular<br />\ntherapy\u2014treatment based on a vitamin<br />\ndiet\u2014as the most effective way that<br />\nscience has yet developed for dealing with<br />\nthis disease. Although he would not wish<br />\nschizophrenia on anyone, he maintains<br />\nthat it can be \"one of the richest learning<br />\nand humanizing experiences life offers.\"<br />\nProvided you recover, of course.<br />\nVonnegut's attitude toward the farm<br />\nlife is one of love and gentle irony in the<br />\nrecollection. He admires the beauty of the<br />\nideals which spurred on the project, but<br />\nhas come to an understanding of<br />\nthe impossibility of complete success for<br />\nany utopian attempt. He also realizes that<br />\nthe world cannot be made better by<br />\nretreating from the mainstream of life.<br />\nThe cause of his insanity he attributes not<br />\nto any specific event but to inevitable<br />\nmental factors within himself. However,<br />\nhe failsito demonstrate convincingly that<br />\nexternal factors such as his parents'<br />\nmarital troubles and his own affair with<br />\nVirginia played no major role in his loss of<br />\nmental balance. The Eden Express should<br />\ninterest those who are not themselves<br />\ncompletely sound of mind, as well as<br />\nanyone who would like to learn how a<br />\nsound, intelligent mind can quickly go to<br />\npieces and come back together again.<br />\n<br />\n\fnovember 21, 1975/news-letter/page 5<br />\nWilson-Wood presents Party Time Tonight in the<br />\nDorm Cafeteria from 9-2.

Unable<br />\nto meet the spiraling costs associated with<br />\nthis new upsurge, institutions turned to<br />\nthe federal government for support, which<br />\nwas readily supplied.<br />\nIn the 20 years since that act of<br />\ngovernment benevolence, universities have<br />\nbecome increasingly reliant on the<br />\ngovernment in all areas of funding.<br />\nThe reliance of the University on<br />\ngovernment monies is not evil or harmful.<br />\nWithout government money Hopkins<br />\nwould never have become a great research<br />\ncenter. President Muller commented,\"We<br />\npay faculty to teach. They are advised to<br />\ngo outside the institution for research<br />\nsupport.\" More often than not,<br />\ngovernment funds are the only means of<br />\nobtaining that needed support.<br />\nUniversity administrators today agree<br />\nthat the move twenty years ago to \"go<br />\ngovernment\" was inevitable.<br />\n\"The only place we could get money<br />\nwas from the government. The University<br />\nhad to decide if they were going to remaip<br />\nas the center of research efforts or get out.<br />\nI don't like to say whether this was a good<br />\nor bad decision, but between the two<br />\nchoices we chose the only one we could,\"<br />\nHomewood Vice President George Benton<br />\nobserves.<br />\nRecent developments, however, have<br />\nfaculty and administrators here<br />\nquestioning that decision.

There are, and they're<br />\norganized in Baltimore.<br />\nMy first contact with this apparent<br />\ninsanity came sometime during my<br />\nfreshman year. A friend happened upon a<br />\nphone number that supposedly could put<br />\nus in touch with the local Nazi Party<br />\nheadquarters. At that time we were in the<br />\nhabit of exploiting the phone as a means<br />\nof entertainment, so within minutes we<br />\nwere huddled over the receiver listening to<br />\nthe recorded message in complete<br />\ndisbelief. I can't recall the particulars of<br />\nthe message, but I distinctly recall the<br />\nreaction of my Jewish accomplice. In his<br />\nown words, \"I'm going to go down there<br />\nand throw a brick through the window.\"<br />\nMonths later the subject came up again.<br />\nA re-indoctrination took place. In the<br />\ncourse of driving out to Icaros, the<br />\n<br />\nuniversally -acknowledged Greek<br />\nrestaurant, we passed a bizarre store front<br />\non Eastern Ave. There was a Nazi flag,<br />\ncomplete with Swastika, hanging right<br />\nalongside an American counterpart. A<br />\ncrudely lettered sign, with enough racial<br />\nslurs to turn anyone's head, announced<br />\nthat this was the headquarters of The<br />\nNational Socialist White People's Party.<br />\nWe began calling again.<br />\nAfter two years of speculation, I finally<br />\nfound myself headed down to 2112<br />\nEastern Ave. in the company of a friend<br />\nwho was to take pictures, and who<br />\nhappens to be Jewish. I approached the<br />\ndoor with some apprehension while Gary<br />\nstood outside taking pictures of the<br />\nstreetside display and bolstering his<br />\ncourage. Fortunately I knew exactly what<br />\nto expect inside. The Sunday Sun<br />\nMagazine ran a two column story in the<br />\nSundries section that accurately depicted<br />\nboth the interior of the bookstore and<br />\nWolfgang Schrodt, the proprietor. Had I<br />\nnot had this preparation in advance, I<br />\nmight have broken into a sweat as well.<br />\nAs I climbed the steps I immediately<br />\nnoticed Wolfgang looming in the door in<br />\nfront of me, possibly observing Gary's<br />\nphotographic activities from across the<br />\nstreet. He opened the door for me and I<br />\nproceeded to gape. It was exactly as I had<br />\nimagined it. Nazi flags and SS banners<br />\nwe re displayed profusely along with<br />\nnumerous posters of Hitler, a podium, a<br />\nshelf of German war medal reproductions<br />\nand of course racks of books and leaflets.<br />\nAnd Wolfgang proudly wore a thirty-eight<br />\nin a black leather holster on his hip, true<br />\nto the description in the Sun. Rimless<br />\nglasses, a thin black tie and white shirt,<br />\nand a closely cropped moustache further<br />\ndefined the character. A massive<br />\n<br />\nRhodesian bushhound leaped up in an<br />\nobviously unaffectionate way.<br />\nFortunately, he was chained to a pipe in<br />\nthe rear of the room.<br />\nI began to \"browse,\" fumbling through<br />\nfree hand-outs that displayed the kind of<br />\nsensational insight that was quoted at the<br />\nbeginning of this article. I attempted to<br />\nstrike up a conversation with Wolfgang,<br />\nwhomI knew from a phone message earlier<br />\nthis fall as the Party's candidate for first<br />\ndistrict councilman. Wolfgang was cordial<br />\nbeyond all of my expectations. After<br />\nfeeding him a few carefully prepared lines<br />\nabout reverse racism in gaining entrance to<br />\nmed school, he really opened up. His<br />\n<br />\nspeech was punctuated with words such as<br />\nNigger-scum, filth, savages, animals and<br />\nJew-bastards. He conveyed a blanket<br />\nhatred for all non-Aryans living in the<br />\nUnited States. He responded favorably to<br />\nGary's question about Hitler's Youth<br />\nCorps, of which he was a member. He<br />\ncommented on the political ideology of<br />\nThe Party, which, while limited to the<br />\nAryan race, seemed vaguely to correspond<br />\nwith my limited knowledge of socialist<br />\nprinciples. Wolfgang contended that<br />\ncommunism was a fine idea, but in the<br />\nSoviet Union the Jews have an<br />\nuncontested strangle-hold.<br />\nIncredibly, we spent a full forty-five<br />\nminutes chatting with Wolfgang, dutifully<br />\nlistening and posing conservative<br />\nquestions. Our purpose was not to differ,<br />\nwhich might have been unwise, but to<br />\nelicit and ascertain that all we had heard<br />\nover the past few years was for real. It was<br />\neasy enough for me to stay relatively<br />\ncomposed, while Gary struggled and<br />\nsweated through the occasional ominous<br />\nglances at his naturally curly hair. We<br />\nweren't sure whether Wolfgang knew or<br />\nnot, but the fact is that it really didn't<br />\nmatter. He posed no threat, as perverse as<br />\nhis opinions might have been.<br />\nHe gave absolutely no indication as to<br />\nhow strong the party is. I seriously doubt<br />\nthat Wolfgang will be the next first district<br />\ncouncilman, or that the party will solicit<br />\nmany new members in the Baltimore area.<br />\nThey are a benign, non-violent group that<br />\nexists more as a curiosity than a<br />\nmalevolent subversive force. The opening<br />\nof the bookstore three years ago incited a<br />\nfew local riots, but things have been quiet,<br />\nalmost sleepy since then. The phone<br />\nanswering service flashes excitedly, while<br />\nWolfgang fingers his cigar placidly.<br />\n<br />\n010MICOIC<br />\n<br />\nPC1100100I0C11001C3010OID010010OIDOtO00:2011212=00LOOIDC1001001001130K3C11001001130113130<br />\n<br />\na<br />\na<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n////7/ /// ///////<br />\n<br />\nDixieland Jazz from the 20's<br />\n<br />\nBob Greene's<br />\n<br />\nThe World of<br />\nJelly Roll Morton<br />\n<br />\nU<br />\na<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\na<br />\na<br />\nU<br />\n<br />\nSunday, November 23<br />\n<br />\na<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n8:30p.m.<br />\nKraushaar Auditorium<br />\nGoucher College<br />\n<br />\nC0.1\"XeS<br />\n<br />\n\u2014 no ean5 \u2014<br />\n<br />\nAlv<br />\n<br />\n- oPer otre$v''<br />\n<br />\nTickets: $6.50-General<br />\nIQD1D1D<br />\n<br />\n$4.00-Students<br />\n<br />\n.iflu11.11Ml<br />\n<br />\nst.m<br />\n<br />\na<br />\na<br />\nU<br />\n<br />\nInformation:<br />\n825-3300, ext., 267<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letter/november 21, 1975<br />\n<br />\n*********************<br />\n<br />\n:OCEAN ROSE<br />\nat<br />\n<br />\nGoucher<br />\nTONIGHT!!!<br />\nStimson<br />\nBeer on Tap<br />\nDINO DE LAUDENT113Presents<br />\n<br />\nin a MICHAEL WINNER film<br />\n<br />\n$1.00<br />\n<br />\n9PM to 1 AM *<br />\n<br />\nFriday Nov. 21<br />\n*********************<br />\n.<br />\ne:<br />\n.<br />\n:<br />\n..<br />\n<br />\n\u2022ott%<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022.. .<br />\nA:<br />\n...%<br />\n<br />\n-. . .-<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n0:<br />\n.<br />\n:<br />\n..<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTh 0<br />\nOff-Campus Housing<br />\nis holding<br />\nan Open House<br />\n<br />\n\u2022:\u2022:::-<br />\n<br />\n:. . :<br />\n..-:<br />\nw<br />\n.:. .<br />\n<br />\nJust in case you haven't seen<br />\nthe posters-<br />\n<br />\nRODEO RICK<br />\nwill be in the<br />\n<br />\nRathskellar<br />\nFriday, November 21,<br />\nfrom 3 'til p.m.<br />\n:.\".:<br />\n<br />\nTHIS WEEKEND<br />\n<br />\nFriday- acoustic<br />\nSaturday- Dance<br />\nAdmission only 25cents<br />\n<br />\nBeThere-Aloha.<br />\n<br />\n\fnovember 21, 1975/news-letter/page 9<br />\n<br />\nDon't close your doors too hard, folks are pennying in<br />\nBy D. H. WARREN<br />\nChapter 4: The Origins ofPenflying-In<br />\nIn those brief days between the<br />\nprehistoric age of Britain, and its more<br />\ntranquil feudal years, the established<br />\nnobles roamed across the green English<br />\ncountryside looking for large family, one<br />\nbedroom, thatched huts. At such a place,<br />\nthe nobles would call the peasant and his<br />\nfamily to a friendly round of<br />\n\"Pencing-In\". The peasant was always<br />\neager to abide, sorely needing the few<br />\npence he might gain. The coins were<br />\nJammed into the lock and then, while the<br />\nPeasants all pushed and shoved against the<br />\ndoor, the hut was set on fire. The princes<br />\nwould make wagers amongst themselves as<br />\nto whether or not the peasants would get<br />\nout, and if so\u2014well, then when?<br />\nThe jolly practice soon ceased when the<br />\nnobles started squabbling with themselves<br />\nand could no longer afford to fool around<br />\nso much.<br />\n\u2014From Histories OfStrange<br />\nand Fascinating Games<br />\nNow that the above and a few other<br />\ninteresting sports have become<br />\npopular\u2014even, fashionable\u2014once again at<br />\nthe Alumni Memorial Residences, it is<br />\nonly appropriate to look into the origins<br />\nof some of these games and what role they<br />\nhave played in the Hopkins past.

Walter Sbrounie, then<br />\ntemporary assistant to the Dean of<br />\nStudents, while rehashing old times with<br />\nthis reporter remembered that night:<br />\n\"It was something else.

Lennox had no comment for the<br />\npress when informed of the new record.<br />\nFriends have told us that he still feels he<br />\nshould be the one we remember since he<br />\ndid it all alone.<br />\nPeriodically, hall-flooding has<br />\n<br />\ndegenerated into individualized<br />\ndowsing\u2014which during the Middle Ages<br />\nhad been collective\u2014and there occurs the<br />\nunfair tactic of pitting several agile<br />\nresidents against one unsuspecting peer.<br />\nThe critics frown on this method, pointing<br />\nout that it does not serve the spirit Of<br />\nfriendly competition.<br />\nThe origins of the spraying of shaving<br />\ncream are uncertain, but recent<br />\nanthropological studies tend to associate<br />\nthe act with fertility rituals. This may<br />\nexplain the lack of such behavior at single<br />\nsex colleges and the first sign of the<br />\nsprayings at Hopkins coinciding with the<br />\ncoeducational move of 1970. Enthusiasts<br />\nrecommend menthol-scented shaving<br />\ncream for the most tasteful results.<br />\nOccasionally, participants report becoming<br />\nsidetracked in creating designs on the<br />\nbathroom mirrors.<br />\nThe popular resurgence of this sport in<br />\nthe Residences this semester has led to the<br />\nformation of numerous teams, each<br />\ncompeting for the coveted Noxzema Cup,<br />\nto be presented at the end of the academic<br />\nyear.

The next<br />\nmorning I hastened to the Baltimore City<br />\nZoo.<br />\nThe walk to the Zoo, which is hidden in<br />\nthe wilderness of Druid Hill Park, was a<br />\ngratifying one, affording an overhead view<br />\nof the Jones Falls, and alongside it the<br />\nmighty Jones Falls Expressway, for which<br />\nthe river was named. The park itself was<br />\ndotted with groups of hangers-out, bikers,<br />\nand picnicers. Deeper into the park, atop a<br />\nSloping lawn, was a large white house\u2014the<br />\nmain entrance to the zoo.<br />\nAfter explaining to the woman at the<br />\ngate that she needn't take my 60 cents as<br />\n<br />\nwe might be engulfed by the sun in the<br />\nnext few moments, and 60 cents wouldn't<br />\nmatter to us then, she admitted me free of<br />\ncharge. The bird exhibit was right inside,<br />\nso I began there. Inside was an impressive<br />\narray of birds, but most striking were the<br />\ntwo horned owls. In their stare I saw an<br />\nacute awareness of their being on the<br />\ninside and my being on the outside.<br />\nDisturbed, I moved on and was greeted by<br />\na \"Hi, how are you?\" from a friendly<br />\ngreen parrot as I left the bird house.<br />\nThe star of any zoo, in my mind, is the<br />\ntiger; his massive head, his air of majesty,<br />\nwhich is retained even behind bars. Much<br />\nto my disappointment however, the<br />\nSiberian Tiger chose to spend the day<br />\nindoors. His neighbor, the jaguar, paced up<br />\nand down his cage, intermittently standing<br />\non his hind legs against the bars,. as if to<br />\ntest them. Coming to the conclusion that<br />\nhe really was stuck for good, the jaguar<br />\nresumed his pacing.<br />\nThe monkeys were in good spirits, as<br />\n<br />\nevidenced by their incessant chatte<br />\nwhich was audible from quite a distranc<br />\nThe baboons greedily accepted peanu.<br />\nfrom us, grabbing them with their small<br />\nwrinkled hands, so hauntingly like our<br />\nown.

However, the<br />\n1190-838 victory must be viewed in the<br />\nlight of the fact that Howard is a new<br />\nteam in the league and is not even<br />\nrecognized by their university officials due<br />\nto fear of injuries on the range, though<br />\nthere have been none to date.<br />\n\"You have to respect them,\" said one<br />\nHopkins team member. \"They manage to<br />\nkeep interest in the team, and they raise<br />\ntheir own funds.

Sargent Shriver, Jr. is<br />\njust like listening to Hubert Humphrey.<br />\nNorman Mailer used to enjoy confusing<br />\npeople by introducing himself as Lyndon<br />\nJohnson's dwarf alter ego. Shriver could<br />\npull a similar act, only billed as the rich<br />\nman's Humphrey. Aside from the<br />\nshrillness, what did Sarge have to say?<br />\nWell, he started by pointing out the<br />\nlong and distinguished history of his<br />\nfamily in Maryland: his ancestor, David<br />\nShriver, served in the Stamp Act Congress<br />\nand was a friend of Charles Carroll of<br />\nCarrollton, signer of the Declaration of<br />\nIndependence and a fellow wealthy<br />\nCatholic enlightened landlord; another<br />\nrelative, Andrew Shriver, President of the<br />\nMaryland Bar Association, donated Shriver<br />\nHall to the University\u2014and don't you<br />\nforget it. His relative recital probably<br />\nturned a lot of people off, but Shriver is<br />\nirrepressible. Nothing gets the man down.<br />\nWho else would once again foist himself<br />\non the American electorate after the<br />\ntrouncing he received with St. George in<br />\n1972. Shriver has never been elected to<br />\nany office; he overcompensates for this<br />\nfact by boasting that he is a manger, an<br />\nexecutive. He told his audience that he<br />\nwould make a lousy Senator or<br /><br />\nCongressman, but that the Presidency was<br />\nthe right job for him. He stressed his<br />\ndiplomatic career as Ambassador to<br />\nFrance and his administrative experience<br />\nas Director of the Peace Corps and head of<br />\nO.E.O. as suitable qualifications for the<br />\nPresidency. His answers to the questions<br />\nposed by, the panel (after a ten-minute<br />\nopening statement, each candidate was<br />\ngrilled for a half hour by a panel of local<br />\npoliticos, labor leaders, A.D.A. activists,<br />\netc., after which selected written questions<br />\nfrom the audience were tackled) were<br />\nbuoyantly optimistic, rambling non<br />\nsequiturs. It amazes me that anyone takes<br />\nShriver's candidacy seriously, especially so<br />\nsavvy a politician as Baltimore City<br />\nCouncil. President Walter Orlinslcy, who<br />\nwill probably head up shriver's campaign<br />\nin this state.

Shriver, like Udall, had<br />\nnoisy partisans in the crowd, but that<br />\ndoesn't mean too much. Any candidate<br />\nworth his salt can pack a gallery; besides,<br />\nShriver has enough relatives in this state to<br />\npack the Civic Center.

It continues as such now with FY<br />\n1973-74 expenditures of $90 million. In<br />\n1966 the APL devoted 8 per cent of its<br />\nbudget to non-war applications. This has<br />\nincreased and APL now devotes 20 per<br />\ncent of its budget to these programs.<br />\nHowever, the primary mission of the<br />\nAPL, as a Federal Contract Research<br />\nCenter, remains the application of<br />\nadvanced science and technology to<br />\nproblems of sophisticated warfare.<br />\nThe Committee for Conversion has<br />\nalready begun its non-violent campaign<br />\nwith letters to the University's senior<br />\nadministrators and Trustees who are<br />\nresponsible for APL's relationship with the<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nThe Committee has based its campaign<br />\nin part on the assertion that nuclear<br />\nweapons can never be used morally, that<br />\nsuch weapons should therefore not exist<br /><br />\nand that no one, certainly not university<br />\npeople, should contribute to nuclear<br />\nweapons research and development.<br />\nThe campaign is also based on the work<br />\nof Professor Seymour Melman of<br />\nColumbia University. He has suggested<br />\nthat changing the use of labor and other<br />\nresearch and production resources form<br />\nmilitary to civilian purposes is desirable so<br />\nthat we may evaluate security problems on<br />\ntheir merits alone and not diffuse this<br />\nissue with considerations of livelihood and<br />\neconomic well-being for labor forces,<br />\nindustries, universities, etc.<br />\nHe also has noted that military<br />\neconomic activity, while contributing<br />\nwages and salaries to persons involved,<br />\nyields products that exit from the<br />\nmarketplace upon being produced. These<br />\nproducts are not part of the current level<br />\nof living, except insofar as tbey contribute<br />\nto inflation.<br />\nPreliminary discussions with University<br />\nofficials suggest that to its credit, the<br />\nAPL has never refused a contract to<br />\nperform non-military work. However, they<br />\nindicated that currently available funds for<br />\nnon-war work are insufficient to maintain<br />\nan efficiently functioning lab.<br />\nConsequently, without the APL's research<br />\nand development of weapons, there would<br />\nbe no work in the fields of transportation,<br />\nbiomedical engineering or civilian air<br />\ntraffic control there.<br />\nFinally, the officers replied that Johns<br />\nHopkins' contributions to U.S. military<br />\nweapons programs are quite appropriate<br />\ngiven present international relationships<br />\nwhich make unilateral disarmament<br />\nundesirable.<br />\nThe Committee will continue to<br />\ncommunicate with University<br />\nadministrators and with workers at APL.<br />\nThey hope, too, that the broader issues of<br />\nthe debate and the APL's current work<br />\nwill stimulate thoughtful action by the<br />\nlarger University community.<br />\nIt is altogether appropriate that Johns<br />\nHopkins, celebrating its centennial as a<br />\nleader in the American educational<br />\ncommunity, should terminate its wasteful<br />\nassociation with the forces of war and<br />\nre-dedicate itself to that creative search for<br />\ntruth for which it was founded.<br /><br />\ngreat cocktail parties in Paris, but he<br />\nremains a personable man of whom it may<br />\nbe said: Deep down, he's shallow.<br />\nTerry Sanford, fomer governor of North<br />\nCarolina and presently President of Duke<br />\nUniversity, was the least impressive<br />\ncandidate. A friend of mine labelled him<br />\n\"a southern-fried Steven Muller\"\u2014but that<br />\ndoes Muller a great injustice. Sanford, a<br />\n\"moderate\" who promised to stop George<br />\nWallace from gaining ground in the South,<br />\nopposes busing. His own educational<br />\nreform scheme is strangely reminiscent<br />\nof the \"separate but equal\" doctrine laid<br />\ndown by the Supreme Court in 1896.<br />\nSanford maintained that the chief reason<br />\nbehind judicial sanctioning of busing was<br />\nthat Dr. James S. Coleman thought it<br />\nmight be a good idea. Now that Dr.<br />\nColeman has changed his mind, there<br />\nremains no justification to bus. (This is<br />\nextraordinary reasoning on Sanford's part.<br />\nI never realized, when I went to junior<br />\nhigh school with his son and played board<br />\ngames designed by him, that this one man,<br />\nColeman, had such great power over the<br />\nnation's judicial minds!) Sanford wants to<br />\ndo away with the present welfare system<br />\nand promises to hold a \"valley<br />\nconference\" (his pun on summit) to<br />\ndiscuss alternatives to the present mess<br />\nwith leading economists. The early<br />\nmorning audience, surfeited with his<br />\nplatitudes, reacted apathetically to Gov.<br />\nSanford. Some of Sanford's job programs<br />\nduring his term as North Carolina's<br />\ngovernor are considered to be the<br />\nforerunners of the War on Poverty of the<br />\nJohnson years. The Governor took much<br />\ncredit for this. Why is it that Sanford (and<br />\nShriver, too, for that manner) speak of the<br />\n\"great accomplishments\" of the Johnson<br />\nadministration when many astute critics<br />\nhave written his Great Society off as a<br />\nfiasco accomplishing little more than<br />\ncreating jobs for more bureaucrats and<br />\nincreasing inflation?

Harris, apostle of the New<br />\nPopulism (which is like the Old Populism,<br />\nsans racist undercurrent), maintained in<br />\nhis book of that name, that McGovern lost<br />\nthe election because he 'didn't emphasize<br />\n\"the people's issues\" hard enough and<br />\nseemed not to know his own mind.

Only in a small portion of the<br />\ncontinent will you see wildlife, a la \"Born<br />\nFree\".(And there are no tigers in Africa.)<br />\nNone of the 'natives' I met had spears.<br />\nInstead, I met a warm people in a country<br />\ncalled Ghana (formally the Gold Coast),<br />\nWest Africa. I'm convinced after my nine<br />\nmonth stay in Ghana that I felt more at<br />\nhome there than any Ghanaian could ever<br />\nfeel at home in a country as 'civilized' as<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nGhanaians, as do many people of the<br />\nso-called 'third', or poor world have a lot<br />\nto teach us about being human. We might<br />\nPrefer to regard these people as'backward'<br />\nOr 'primitive',<br />\nbut in doing so we are<br />\nlimiting our own perspectives. Ghanaians<br />\nhave so little in the way of 'things' yet<br />\ntheir culture is rich. The way people go<br />\nabout their lives is indeed very basic, and<br />\nin a sense more sane andmeaningful than<br /><br />\nthe way we live ours. The beauty of simple<br />\nthings abounds in tropical West Africa,<br />\nwalking especially. For the mass of the<br />\npeople things still happen slowly in this<br />\npart of the world and the best way to see<br />\nwhat is happening is on foot, not through<br />\nthe windshield of a speeding car. Often I'd<br />\n1<br />\n4<br />\nwalk around Accra, a bustling city of /<br />\nmillion people, and invariably I was<br />\ncaptured by the dizziness and beauty of it<br />\nall. I'd weave my way through crowded<br />\nand colorful markets where the 'mammies'<br /><br />\nre<br /><br />\nLa<br /><br />\n3t<br />\n,<br /><br />\nOld Women in Traditional at an Annual Festival<br /><br />\nFriends in a Coastal Fishing Village<br />\n(women traders) each sold their own line<br />\nof goods, whether it be fabric, pots and<br />\npans, canned goods, or tobacco goods.<br />\nSometimes I'd stop and chat until my<br />\nlimited knowledge of Twi (one of the<br />\nseveral main languages spoken in Ghana)<br />\nwas expended. Moving on with smiles I'd<br />\nfeel fine about talking to some average<br />\nfolks who were just doing like me, living<br />\ntheir lives.<br />\nContrasted with the fast-pace action of<br />\nAccra, was the tranquility of some small<br />\nvillages I visited. Often on Sundays I<br />\nwould walk about two miles to a friend's<br />\nvillage where we would relax and enjoy<br />\nthe late afternoon drumming. Sunday is a<br />\nheavy day for drumming in Ghana, and it<br />\ncertainly comes off as a bit more spiritual<br />\nand powerful than watching a football<br />\ngame on T.V. Village life is no picnic.<br />\nSurely people would like electricity and<br />\nrunning water in their homes, but they<br />\nrealize that change is slow. They live their<br />\nlives as best they can. I was always struck<br />\nby the resourcefulness of Ghanaians. From<br />\nour perspective they get by with so little,<br />\nbut in a sense this only brings home the<br />\nillusion that to have more 'things' is<br />\nnecessarily good, that 'things' rather than<br />\npeople are what's important, an illusion<br />\nwhich has saturated our mode of life.<br />\nGhana was in people, not things.

There is a radio station<br />\non this campus. The name of the station is<br />\nWJHU and it is located deep in the bowels<br />\nof the freshman dorms.Doiyou know that?<br />\nNow you do, and if you tell someone else,<br />\nthat will make three of us.<br />\nDJ<br />\nThe aspiring DJ sets out for WJHU with<br />\nhigh hopes of becoming a vital component<br />\nof a. expensive but well-oiled piece of<br />\nmachinery, enough to have\u2014o holy of<br />\nholies\u2014one's own show, just being around<br />\nall those pros, soaking up the<br />\nexpertise\u2014how rewarding it will be! The<br />\nfledgling DJ is somewhat dashed to<br />\ndiscover that the station of those innocent<br />\ndreams is a closet-like cubicle with the<br />\ntemperature of a sauna, inches away from<br />\nWashers sloshing in the laundry room. The<br />\nWalls are covered with aging posters of<br />\naging rock stars; the floor sports a<br />\ndisheartening layer of year-old Billboard<br />\nmagazines and human fingernails. The<br />\nmachinery, although not any older than<br />\nthe Civil War, is certainly not a:iy younger.<br /><br />\nIn short, the station is, at first look, a<br />\ndisappointment.<br />\nThe would-be DJ takes a deep<br />\nbreath\u2014wisely, from the hall\u2014and<br />\nvaliantly switches mental gears,<br />\nsubstituting actual station for station of<br />\ndreams.

Do you<br />\nrespect the values of House Beautiful?<br />\nThink of that'devoted following that isn't<br />\nfollowing yet, but will be..

Surrounded by<br />\ndeteriorating machinery and a record file<br />\ncontaining the largest Frank Sinatra<br />\ncollection known to exist on a college<br />\ncampus, the DJ is confronted with the fact<br />\nthat almost no one 'actually listens to<br /><br />\nlikes.

Then, according to<br />\nJohn B. Quixton's excellent The Carroll<br />\nCadre (The New Channak Press; 1937),<br />\n\"The old man paused and gazed at the<br />\nBenedictine crucifix above the mantlepiece.<br />\nSuddenly he raised his cane and brought it<br />\ntrashing down against the floor. 'The<br />\nwrath of God shall descend upon ye, my<br />\nson, and a blight will settle sooner on ye<br />\nland,' whereupon Charles Jr. rose from the<br />\nwindowseat and walked out of the manor<br />\nnever to return.\"<br />\nAfter two years of remorse and<br /><br />\nCarroll Exhibit<br />\nbrow-beating by his daughter, Charles<br />\nfinally relented and journeyed to<br />\nBaltimore from his palatial Howard<br />\nCounty estate, Doughoregan Manor.

As for<br />\nmyself, I feel gypped in at least two out of<br />\nthree purchases. The new Crosby-Nash<br />\ncollaboration, Wind on the Water, is<br />\nrecycled mishmash. It must be that Messrs.<br />\nDavid and Graham feel fleeting youth<br />\nslipping from their gasp (alas!), for, with<br />\nall the subtlety of a pile-driver, they seem<br />\nto be attempting to make their music have<br />\nsome kind of lasting artistic and social<br />\nsignificance. It doesn't work. They employ<br />\nsome o f the finest studio musiciarfs<br />\navailable, who, despite their talents,<br />\ncannot help but sound a bit put off, if not<br />\nbored, by all this pretentiousness. Crosby<br />\nblunders embarrassingly in thinking that<br />\nmaking a literary allusion equals being<br />\n\"poetic,\" e.g.: \"How could Samson / I<br />\nthought he was blind as a bat! How could<br />\nhe have torn down / a temple like that?\"<br />\nAs if that weren't enough, we get, just<br />\nwhat we need, another save-the-whale<br />\necology song. Singing about whales is not,<br />\ndammit, going to save any, nor is it going<br />\nto inspire your average record buyer to<br />\nrush out and strike down some Japanese<br />\nAhab with his atomic harpoon. Previous<br />\nCrosby and Nash solo albums or<br />\ncollaborations all had a lot going for them:<br />\nthis one just sputters.<br />\nAs for Stephen Stills' new album<br />\n(entitled, gee, that's funny, Stills), I have<br />\nno one but myself to blame for wasting<br />\nmy money on it. His earlier efforts<br />\ndictated that this most recent one would<br />\nbe just another monomaniac ego-show,<br />\nand, yes, it is. A friend of mine lauds the<br />\nalbum for \"precision,\" but then again, he<br />\nalso gets a charge out listening to accutron<br />\nwatches.<br />\nSo that leaves us with Neil Young, and<br />\nthat's wfio I really want to talk about. His new<br />\nalbum,. just out, comes only a few months<br />\nafter his release of the Degenerate Album<br />\nof the Year, Tonight's the Night,<br />\nwhich\u2014despite the fact that it initially<br />\nSounds/like something you would record<br />\nafter pulling a week; (at least) of<br />\nall-fighters\u2014I find to be one of the most<br />\ninteresting and (if there is such a thing)<br />\nsignificant rock albums in a long time. In<br />\nit, Young reveals that starkly candid side<br />\nof a performer we so rarely see: or wait a<br />\nminute, is it just another part of a big<br /><br />\nperformance? If you can keep yourself<br />\nfrom turning it off, you'll inevitably start<br />\nto flow with it. Listen to it at least once,<br />\njust to catch those amazing lines that<br />\nweird Neil Young can get away with, while<br />\nthey would sound like ridiculously puerile<br />\nattempts at freakiness if Stills or the other<br />\nguys tried to pull them off. For example:<br />\n\"I'm singing this borrowed tune /1 took<br />\nfrom the Rolling Stones / Alone in this<br />\nempty room / Too wasted to write my<br />\nown;\" or, on the lighter side, \"I'm not<br />\n.going back to Woodstock for awhile I<br />\nThough I long to hear that lonesome<br />\nhippie smile.\" Such lines should be heard,<br />\nhowever, not read, for in Young's, er,<br />\nunique voice lies much of their effect.<br />\nNeil Young ,<br />\nNeil Young's brand new album is called<br />\nZuma. The title, if you're wondering, is an<br />\nabridgement of the name Montezuma, the<br />\nlast chieftain, of the Aztec tribe laid to<br />\nwaste by Cortez, whose achievement<br />\nYoung puts in perspective in his song,<br />\n\"Cortez the Killer.\" Before listening to<br />\nthis album, you should give the cover a<br />\ngood once-over. It has all the artistic merit<br />\nof a footprint. A weird black-and-white<br />\ndesert scene is depicted, with, not at all<br />\nsubtly, various cacti assuming the shape<br />\nyour hand takes when you wish to indicate<br />\nto that obnoxious someone,just what you<br />\ncan do, buddy. The cover seems almost a<br />\nsnide retort to those of the new Stills and<br />\nCrosby-Nash albums, which shine with all<br />\ntoo glossy photos of our heroes.<br />\nOne electric number,, \"Stupid Girl,\" gives<br />\na new twist to the love song, and features<br />\nsuch curious compliments as \"You're such<br />\na beautiful fish / Flopping in the summer<br />\nsand\" (but flattery will get you nowhere).<br />\nThe album's quiet songs are what really<br />\nstand out. The boys in the band do some<br />\nhauntingly effective backup singing, rather<br />\nchanting, on a very nice piece, \"Pardon<br />\nMy Heart.\" CSN&amp;Y fans should pick up<br />\nthis album if for nothing else than the last<br />\nsong, \"Through My Sails,\" an acoustic<br />\nballad that reunites the four for a striking<br />\none-shot effect that hints where they<br />\ncould have gone had they not disbanded.<br />\nSince Young is at the helm, the song<br />\nsuffers from none of the studio overkill<br />\nthat so greatly weakened Deja Vu. If,<br />\nworking together, all four can produce<br />\nsongs of such quality, then I can only<br />\nimpatiently hope that they get together<br />\nfor one more extended try.

His role at the<br />\nCongress was that of an arbitrator between<br />\nthe various geographical factions. Carroll<br />\nwas the second man (preceeded only by<br />\nJohn Hancock) to sign the Declaration. He<br />\nspoke these prophetic words on the day<br />\nbefore, \"The dawn is overcast, ye morning<br />\nlowers and heavily brings on ye day bign<br />\nwith ye fate of Liberty.\"<br />\nIn The Field Of Foreign;Affairs<br />\nLater in 1776, Carroll, along with Ben<br />\nFranklin and financier Samuel Chase,<br />\ntravelled to Canada to seek an alliance<br /><br />\nwith other dissatisfied British subjects.<br />\nLittle is known of this unsuccessful<br />\nadventure except for this cryptic remark'<br />\nfrom Carroll's journal, \"What savage<br />\npractices these Canucks engage<br />\nthemselves!\"<br />\nIn Government<br />\nOn December 12, 1788, the Maryland<br />\nHouse of Delegates elected John Henry and<br />\nCharles Carroll to be the first United<br />\nStates Senators from Maryland. On<br />\nSeptember 23, 1791, Charles Carroll was<br />\nelected Maryland State Senator. On<br />\nNovember 5, 1792, the Maryland<br />\nlegislature passed a bill that prohibits<br />\nholding simultaneous seats in the Federal<br />\nand State legislatures. Carroll resigned his<br />\nseat in Washington saying,\"A humble man<br />\nhas a humble job.\"<br />\nGlory And The Shrewd Businessman<br />\nOn July 4, 1826, the day both John<br />\nAdams and Thomas Jefferson died,<br />\nCharles Carroll became the last surviving<br />\nsigner of the Declaration of Independence.<br />\nIn 1828, Carroll undertook his most<br />\nambitious investment, the founding of the<br />\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad. This was<br />\nadded to his already vast business holdings<br />\nwhich lead Quixton to write, \"One can<br />\nnot help but wonder if Carroll's interest in<br />\nthe Revolution was something more than<br />\njust freedom.\" Carroll never did see the<br />\nB&amp;O become a success; he died quietly in<br />\nhis sleep on November 14, 1832.<br /><br />\nEden Express<br /><br />\nVonnegut relives insanity<br />\nBy MICHAEL BELLOW<br />\nIf you want to find out how a<br />\nschizophrenic person thinks and acts, the<br />\nbest thing to do would be to go nuts<br />\nyourself.

After a year of<br />\nunrewarding work, he set out for British<br />\nColumbia, Canada, with the intention of<br />\nstarting a utopian hippie community.<br />\nAfter setting up a farm along with<br />\nseveral friends in the unsoiled wilderness<br />\nwhere he had purchased his land, Mark<br />\nbegan to feel the peculiar sensations of<br />\nliving in \"Eden\"\u2014the beauty of the<br />\nsurroundings, detachment from hectic life,<br />\nand sense of closeness to the others.<br />\nHowever, he soon could not control his<br />\nthousand-mile-an-hour thoughts and<br />\ninsatiable desire to be understood by all<br />\nthose around him. On trips away from the<br />\nfarm, he was unable to function<br />\nnormally\u2014\"Just getting back to the farm<br />\nwhere things made sense became<br />\neverything.\" Mark lost his ability to eat or<br />\nsleep and his weight decreased drastitally.<br />\nAt last, with great reluctance, he was<br />\nplaced 'in a psychiatric hospital.<br />\nRepulsed by the atmosphere of the nut<br />\nhouse, Mark succeeded in getting himself<br />\nreleased before he was completely cured.<br />\nBack in the hospital again after<br />\nsuccumbing to a drug orgy, he now<br />\nsubmitted faithfully to the prescribed<br />\ntreatment and was successfully cured.<br />\nFeeling well and capable of handling life<br />\noutside of the farm, Mark went back East,<br />\nwhere he is now applying himself toward<br />\neducational pursuits.<br />\nVonnegut describes graphically the life<br />\nof the farm\u2014we see its ups and downs,<br />\nvirtues and flaws.

But Vonnegut's major intent is the<br />\npersonal recollections of a schizophrenic<br />\nexperience, and in this he certainlY<br />\nsucceeds. Much is left vague; many aspects<br />\nof his experience cannot be recounted or<br />\ndescribed.<br />\nIn spite of the difficulty of putting such<br />\nphenomena into words, The Eden Express<br />\nis not really a difficult book.

He can recall and relate manY<br />\nof the thoughts which raced through his<br />\nmind, and make us understand if not<br />\nappreciate them. In the final analysis.<br />\nVonnegut rejects the belief that<br />\nschizophrenia requires a \"poetic\" cure and<br />\nrecommends orthomolecular<br />\ntherapy\u2014treatment based on a vitamin<br />\ndiet\u2014as the most effective way that<br />\nscience has yet developed for dealing with<br />\nthis disease. Although he would not wish<br />\nschizophrenia on anyone, he maintains<br />\nthat it can be \"one of the richest learning<br />\nand humanizing experiences life offers.\"<br />\nProvided you recover, of course.<br />\nVonnegut's attitude toward the farm<br />\nlife is one of love and gentle irony in the<br />\nrecollection. He admires the beauty of the<br />\nideals which spurred on the project, but<br />\nhas come to an understanding of<br />\nthe impossibility of complete success for<br />\nany utopian attempt. He also realizes that<br />\nthe world cannot be made better by<br />\nretreating from the mainstream of life.<br />\nThe cause of his insanity he attributes not<br />\nto any specific event but to inevitable<br />\nmental factors within himself. However,<br />\nhe failsito demonstrate convincingly that<br />\nexternal factors such as his parents'<br />\nmarital troubles and his own affair with<br />\nVirginia played no major role in his loss of<br />\nmental balance.

Unable<br />\nto meet the spiraling costs associated with<br />\nthis new upsurge, institutions turned to<br />\nthe federal government for support, which<br />\nwas readily supplied.<br />\nIn the 20 years since that act of<br />\ngovernment benevolence, universities have<br />\nbecome increasingly reliant on the<br />\ngovernment in all areas of funding.<br />\nThe reliance of the University on<br />\ngovernment monies is not evil or harmful.<br />\nWithout government money Hopkins<br />\nwould never have become a great research<br />\ncenter. President Muller commented,\"We<br />\npay faculty to teach. They are advised to<br />\ngo outside the institution for research<br />\nsupport.\" More often than not,<br />\ngovernment funds are the only means of<br />\nobtaining that needed support.<br />\nUniversity administrators today agree<br />\nthat the move twenty years ago to \"go<br />\ngovernment\" was inevitable.<br />\n\"The only place we could get money<br />\nwas from the government. The University<br />\nhad to decide if they were going to remaip<br />\nas the center of research efforts or get out.<br />\nI don't like to say whether this was a good<br />\nor bad decision, but between the two<br />\nchoices we chose the only one we could,\"<br />\nHomewood Vice President George Benton<br />\nobserves.<br />\nRecent developments, however, have<br />\nfaculty and administrators here<br />\nquestioning that decision.

There are, and they're<br />\norganized in Baltimore.<br />\nMy first contact with this apparent<br />\ninsanity came sometime during my<br />\nfreshman year. A friend happened upon a<br />\nphone number that supposedly could put<br />\nus in touch with the local Nazi Party<br />\nheadquarters. At that time we were in the<br />\nhabit of exploiting the phone as a means<br />\nof entertainment, so within minutes we<br />\nwere huddled over the receiver listening to<br />\nthe recorded message in complete<br />\ndisbelief. I can't recall the particulars of<br />\nthe message, but I distinctly recall the<br />\nreaction of my Jewish accomplice. In his<br />\nown words, \"I'm going to go down there<br />\nand throw a brick through the window.\"<br />\nMonths later the subject came up again.<br />\nA re-indoctrination took place. In the<br />\ncourse of driving out to Icaros, the<br /><br />\nuniversally -acknowledged Greek<br />\nrestaurant, we passed a bizarre store front<br />\non Eastern Ave. There was a Nazi flag,<br />\ncomplete with Swastika, hanging right<br />\nalongside an American counterpart. A<br />\ncrudely lettered sign, with enough racial<br />\nslurs to turn anyone's head, announced<br />\nthat this was the headquarters of The<br />\nNational Socialist White People's Party.<br />\nWe began calling again.<br />\nAfter two years of speculation, I finally<br />\nfound myself headed down to 2112<br />\nEastern Ave. in the company of a friend<br />\nwho was to take pictures, and who<br />\nhappens to be Jewish. I approached the<br />\ndoor with some apprehension while Gary<br />\nstood outside taking pictures of the<br />\nstreetside display and bolstering his<br />\ncourage. Fortunately I knew exactly what<br />\nto expect inside. The Sunday Sun<br />\nMagazine ran a two column story in the<br />\nSundries section that accurately depicted<br />\nboth the interior of the bookstore and<br />\nWolfgang Schrodt, the proprietor. Had I<br />\nnot had this preparation in advance, I<br />\nmight have broken into a sweat as well.<br />\nAs I climbed the steps I immediately<br />\nnoticed Wolfgang looming in the door in<br />\nfront of me, possibly observing Gary's<br />\nphotographic activities from across the<br />\nstreet. He opened the door for me and I<br />\nproceeded to gape. It was exactly as I had<br />\nimagined it. Nazi flags and SS banners<br />\nwe re displayed profusely along with<br />\nnumerous posters of Hitler, a podium, a<br />\nshelf of German war medal reproductions<br />\nand of course racks of books and leaflets.<br />\nAnd Wolfgang proudly wore a thirty-eight<br />\nin a black leather holster on his hip, true<br />\nto the description in the Sun. Rimless<br />\nglasses, a thin black tie and white shirt,<br />\nand a closely cropped moustache further<br />\ndefined the character. A massive<br /><br />\nRhodesian bushhound leaped up in an<br />\nobviously unaffectionate way.<br />\nFortunately, he was chained to a pipe in<br />\nthe rear of the room.<br />\nI began to \"browse,\" fumbling through<br />\nfree hand-outs that displayed the kind of<br />\nsensational insight that was quoted at the<br />\nbeginning of this article. I attempted to<br />\nstrike up a conversation with Wolfgang,<br />\nwhomI knew from a phone message earlier<br />\nthis fall as the Party's candidate for first<br />\ndistrict councilman. Wolfgang was cordial<br />\nbeyond all of my expectations. After<br />\nfeeding him a few carefully prepared lines<br />\nabout reverse racism in gaining entrance to<br />\nmed school, he really opened up. His<br /><br />\nspeech was punctuated with words such as<br />\nNigger-scum, filth, savages, animals and<br />\nJew-bastards. He conveyed a blanket<br />\nhatred for all non-Aryans living in the<br />\nUnited States. He responded favorably to<br />\nGary's question about Hitler's Youth<br />\nCorps, of which he was a member. He<br />\ncommented on the political ideology of<br />\nThe Party, which, while limited to the<br />\nAryan race, seemed vaguely to correspond<br />\nwith my limited knowledge of socialist<br />\nprinciples. Wolfgang contended that<br />\ncommunism was a fine idea, but in the<br />\nSoviet Union the Jews have an<br />\nuncontested strangle-hold.<br />\nIncredibly, we spent a full forty-five<br />\nminutes chatting with Wolfgang, dutifully<br />\nlistening and posing conservative<br />\nquestions. Our purpose was not to differ,<br />\nwhich might have been unwise, but to<br />\nelicit and ascertain that all we had heard<br />\nover the past few years was for real. It was<br />\neasy enough for me to stay relatively<br />\ncomposed, while Gary struggled and<br />\nsweated through the occasional ominous<br />\nglances at his naturally curly hair. We<br />\nweren't sure whether Wolfgang knew or<br />\nnot, but the fact is that it really didn't<br />\nmatter. He posed no threat, as perverse as<br />\nhis opinions might have been.<br />\nHe gave absolutely no indication as to<br />\nhow strong the party is. I seriously doubt<br />\nthat Wolfgang will be the next first district<br />\ncouncilman, or that the party will solicit<br />\nmany new members in the Baltimore area.<br />\nThey are a benign, non-violent group that<br />\nexists more as a curiosity than a<br />\nmalevolent subversive force. The opening<br />\nof the bookstore three years ago incited a<br />\nfew local riots, but things have been quiet,<br />\nalmost sleepy since then. The phone<br />\nanswering service flashes excitedly, while<br />\nWolfgang fingers his cigar placidly.<br /><br />\n010MICOIC<br /><br />\nPC1100100I0C11001C3010OID010010OIDOtO00:2011212=00LOOIDC1001001001130K3C11001001130113130<br /><br />\na<br />\na<br />\na<br /><br />\n////7/ /// ///////<br /><br />\nDixieland Jazz from the 20's<br /><br />\nBob Greene's<br /><br />\nThe World of<br />\nJelly Roll Morton<br /><br />\nU<br />\na<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\na<br />\na<br />\nU<br /><br />\nSunday, November 23<br /><br />\na<br />\na<br /><br />\n8:30p.m.<br />\nKraushaar Auditorium<br />\nGoucher College<br /><br />\nC0.1\"XeS<br /><br />\n\u2014 no ean5 \u2014<br /><br />\nAlv<br /><br />\n- oPer otre$v''<br /><br />\nTickets: $6.50-General<br />\nIQD1D1D<br /><br />\n$4.00-Students<br /><br />\n.iflu11.11Ml<br /><br />\nst.m<br /><br />\na<br />\na<br />\nU<br /><br />\nInformation:<br />\n825-3300, ext., 267<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/november 21, 1975<br /><br />\n*********************<br /><br />\n:OCEAN ROSE<br />\nat<br /><br />\nGoucher<br />\nTONIGHT!!!<br />\nStimson<br />\nBeer on Tap<br />\nDINO DE LAUDENT113Presents<br /><br />\nin a MICHAEL WINNER film<br /><br />\n$1.00<br /><br />\n9PM to 1 AM *<br /><br />\nFriday Nov. 21<br />\n*********************<br />\n.<br />\ne:<br />\n.<br />\n:<br />\n..<br /><br />\n\u2022ott%<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022.. .<br />\nA:<br />\n...%<br /><br />\n-. . .-<br /><br />\n.<br />\n0:<br />\n.<br />\n:<br />\n..<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTh 0<br />\nOff-Campus Housing<br />\nis holding<br />\nan Open House<br /><br />\n\u2022:\u2022:::-<br /><br />\n:. . :<br />\n..-:<br />\nw<br />\n.:. .<br /><br />\nJust in case you haven't seen<br />\nthe posters-<br /><br />\nRODEO RICK<br />\nwill be in the<br /><br />\nRathskellar<br />\nFriday, November 21,<br />\nfrom 3 'til p.m.<br />\n:.\".:<br /><br />\nTHIS WEEKEND<br /><br />\nFriday- acoustic<br />\nSaturday- Dance<br />\nAdmission only 25cents<br /><br />\nBeThere-Aloha.<br /><br />\nnovember 21, 1975/news-letter/page 9<br /><br />\nDon't close your doors too hard, folks are pennying in<br />\nBy D. H. WARREN<br />\nChapter 4: The Origins ofPenflying-In<br />\nIn those brief days between the<br />\nprehistoric age of Britain, and its more<br />\ntranquil feudal years, the established<br />\nnobles roamed across the green English<br />\ncountryside looking for large family, one<br />\nbedroom, thatched huts. At such a place,<br />\nthe nobles would call the peasant and his<br />\nfamily to a friendly round of<br />\n\"Pencing-In\". The peasant was always<br />\neager to abide, sorely needing the few<br />\npence he might gain.
