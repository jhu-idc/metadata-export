Robert Bilgrave, formerly<br />\nAdmissions Director and now the<br />\nDirector of Student Affairs, stressed that the university seeks to give<br />\nindividual consideration to every<br />\nstudent's problems. Further, in<br />\nBilgrave's opinion, to impose academic sanctions on a student who<br />\nviolates what he believes to be an<br />\nunjust law would be tatamount to<br />\nplacing the student in double jeopardy for the same offense.<br />\nNoting that the admission of a<br />\nstudent to either the undergraduate or graduate level of the university,and echoing the sentiments<br />\nof an Arts and Sciences Department spokesman, Bilgrave maintained that a conviction for a draft<br />\nlaw violation would not be sufficient cause to exclude a potential<br />\nstudent from the university.<br />\n<br />\nJail Bird Students Divided<br />\nEditors' note: John Haydon left<br />\nHopkins last year and travelled to<br />\nAustralia.

Present facilities were accused of being too few, possessing<br />\nlimited availability, and tending to<br />\nisolate various groups of people<br />\nwho already know each other.<br />\nChanges advocated to relieve this<br />\nsituation included special programs for students not in organized activities and the establishment<br />\nof new places for people to meet.<br />\nAnother significant complaint<br />\nstated that the University was not<br />\nproviding for the overall social<br />\nand cultural education of the<br />\nstudent, his -intellect, and the neglect of other important aspects of<br />\n<br />\nlife. The shortage of game rooms<br />\nand lounges was frequently mentioned, as was the need for more<br />\nand better athletic facilities.<br />\nOften recommended .to improve these deficiencies were the<br />\nrenovation and expansion of Levering Hall, repeatedly described as<br />\ninadequate, and the creation of a<br />\nstudent union to incorporate necessary activities.

Other grievances included the shortage of comfortable<br />\nstudy places and of cultural activities, such as art galleries and<br />\nstudios.<br />\nThe CISF did not offer any<br />\nsolutions but did make some<br />\ngeneral recommendations, stating<br />\nthat fuller investigation was necessary and that a greater survey of<br />\nopinion on the campus should be<br />\nobtained.<br />\n<br />\nSA Plans Conference<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Association will<br />\nHopkins Freshman Paul Hearn hold a major metropolitan-wide<br />\nwas elected Secretary of Region \"Conference on Student InvolveIll of the College Young Republi- ment in the City\" on Saturday,<br />\ncans during their annual convent- April 6, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.<br />\nion held this past weekend in at Levering Hall.<br />\nStaunton.

Hoffman<br />\n<br />\nKennedy or McCarthy ?<br />\nRobert Kennedy's entrance into the presidential race poses a serious problem, particularly for the college student who was happily<br />\nsurprised last November when Senator Eugene McCarthy offered a<br />\nviable alternative to Lyndon Johnson. At stake is the future of the<br />\nfirst anti-war movement to arise within the legitimate political system of this country in regards to the War in Vietnam.<br />\nThe emotionalism surrounding Kennedy's decision, both pro and<br />\ncon, must be dispelled before judgment may be passed on his candidacy. Charges that Kennedy is opportunistic and a cut-throat politician are irrelevant, if not unfair. Just as McCarthy did last November,<br />\nKennedy's action has irrevocably put his political future in jeopardy,<br />\nboth nationally and in his home state of New York. We must agree<br />\nwith James Reston in saying that Kennedy felt he could no longer<br />\nkeep silent and that he entered the race on the conviction that he has<br />\na better chance of victory than McCarthy.<br />\nThe question we taCe now, is who to support, especially considering the fact that students have proven themselves to be an effective<br />\nforce, at least in the primary campaigns. Those who back Kennedy<br />\ninevitably offer the contention that Kennedy is a winner; McCarthy<br />\nis not. However, in considering this claim we must review the situation as it, stands now. McCarthy began a campaign, with little money<br />\nand virtually no outside support, and ended up heading a drive which<br />\namassed 42% of the Democratic votes in the New Hampshire Primary.<br />\nMoreover, analysts are predicting a possible McCarthy victory in<br />\nWisconsin. As for Kennedy, the situation has changed considerably<br />\nsince the \"Kennedy Boom\" of a year ago. Kennedy, by his inaction,<br />\nhas alienated a substantial segment of his following. There is no indication that he has inherited, intact, the successful political machine<br />\nbuilt by his brother, the late President. At this time, he has failed<br />\nto mobilize significant support among party chieftains and influential figures. In short, McCarthy has proven his ability to win and to<br />\nlead the antiwar movement. Kennedy's chances remain theoretical<br />\nand are still doubtful.<br />\nOn this basis, we continue to support Eugene McCarthy for the<br />\npresidency and we urge those who have been politically active in his<br />\ncampaign to honor their previous committment to him. Only if the<br />\nMcCarthy drive should falter in the late primaries or at the convention<br />\ncould we see a reassessment in favor of Kennedy.<br />\n<br />\nNewsprint Poverty Pocket<br />\nAt Hopkins, where the concept of \"community\" is a popular<br />\nmyth, despite the flowery claims of our catalogue which are so far<br />\nfrom the truth that they border on obscenity, there remains one<br />\nmedium which comes relatively close to providing a common meeting place for the undergraduate \u2022body - - student publications. There<br />\nhave been many other fantasy-plans, which either haven't worked or<br />\nweren't implemented, meant to make the community a reality. That<br />\na true community has never materialized is another conformation of<br />\nthe common knowledge that the undergraduate body is low on the<br />\nlist of the University's priorities.<br />\nThe few student publications which survive (or rather, subsist) at<br />\nHopkins form the most necessary segment of a potential community<br />\n- - communication of news and ideas. Yet, these same publications<br />\neither face failure or can't fulfill their potential due to the prevalent<br />\nAdministration attitude towards undergraduate affairs.<br />\nThe recent incident concerning the Vector symboliies this sorepoint. The Vector is a high quality magazine which has been an admirable example of an undergraduate publication. It may be true<br />\nthat its staff was far from faultless in planning its budget. However,<br />\nthe Administration does not seem to be in any rush to insure the<br />\nsurvival of the Vector or to make possible the maintenance of its<br />\nhigh standards. The Charles Street Review, which is attempting an<br />\nambitious revival, faces similar financial problems. The _News-Letter<br />\nborders on a situation where it must subordinate copy demands to<br />\naccomodate the overabundant advertising which is necessary to compensate for the lack of University funds.<br />\nThese publications comprise a major part of few signs of undergraduate life -on campus. The funds necessary to put all campus publications on a comfortable basis would be minute compared to other<br />\nexpenditures. It narrows down to a basic question of whether the<br />\nUniversity really cares whether these few signs of life survive or not.<br />\nThe undergraduate body would certainly benefit from a Vector<br />\nwhich could afford to come out bi-monthly, a Charles Street Review<br />\nwhich could come out quarterly, and a News-Letter which could<br />\nafford to expand its coverage of relevant events. Though these may<br />\nbe pipe-dreams, we still await some indication from the Administration that it gives a damn.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MARCH 22,1968<br />\n<br />\nBy LEO MANGLAVITTI<br />\n(Bloom walks on a net, covers<br />\nhis left eye with his left ear,<br />\npasses through several walls, climbs<br />\nNelson's Pillar, hangs from the<br />\ntop ledge by his eyelids, eats<br />\ntwelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals. several sufferers<br />\nfrom king's evil, contracts his<br />\nface so as to resemble many historical personages, . . . turns each<br />\nfoot simultaneously in different<br />\ndirections, bids the tide turn back,<br />\neclipses the sun by extending his<br />\nlittle finger.)<br />\nJoseph Strick's ULYSSES is a<br />\n')ad film. It has taken me exactly<br />\nJne year to admit what an inordinate affection for Joyce and his<br />\nBloomepic had previously kept<br />\nme from admitting. Whereas many<br />\ncritics, myself included, were willing to credit Strick with a good<br />\njob for what he attempted, they<br />\nall cited the book's unfilmability<br />\nas a hindrance to the film's success. Now I admit that hindrance<br />\nis enough to invalidate the film.<br />\nMichael Hirsh,film-maker,summed it up last Saturday: \"To<br />\nsomeone who has not read the<br />\nnovel, the film is senseless. To<br />\nsomeone who has read the novel,<br />\nthe film is insignificant.\" This is<br />\nso self-evidently true that debate<br />\nshould end here. If only on the<br />\nlevel of unfilmable happenings,<br />\nlike the physical virtuosity quoted<br />\nabove, let alone the stream of<br />\n<br />\nconsciousness complexity, filming<br />\nJoyce must constitute an emasculation of his art.<br />\nBut Hirsh may provide a compromise. He explained a new technique he is developing for the<br />\ncombined use of animation and<br />\nlive action to make more realistic<br />\nthe Gestallt psychological effect<br />\nin frame-splitting (showing many<br />\nactions simultaneously). Witlmethods too complicated to be<br />\ndiscussed here, Hirsh hopes to<br />\ncreate a real-unreal montage interworking of the conscious and<br />\nsubconscious levels of visual perception. The total effect for the<br />\nviewer is an expanded participation in the film as the live<br />\naction and animation coalesce into<br />\na perceivable whole.<br />\nWhy not use total animation?<br />\nInformally, later, half hanging out<br />\nof a rainswept window, Hirsh<br />\nagreed that Joyce could be filmed<br />\nonly in animation. Earlier he had<br />\nshown some 1935 Disney cartoons, with scripts by then-budding writers, William Burroughs and<br />\nSamuel Beckett .The literally absurd antics of Donald and Mickey,<br />\nvictims of the Burroughs-Becket<br />\nphantasmagoria, have effect only<br />\nin animation. But Disney is dead,<br />\nand the cheap, pseudo-animation<br />\nof Huckleberry Hound is in vogue.<br />\nThe days of animation as a true<br />\nart form may never be again.<br />\nULYSSES would be a perfect<br />\nsubject for a cartoon renaissance.<br />\nThis is not meant to insult Joyce's<br />\n<br />\nachievement. If the book is to be<br />\nfilmed, the fantastic exploits of<br />\nBloom and company, like the<br />\nDisney fantasies, could only be<br />\ndone in animation. The unfilmable<br />\narray of characters and their bizarre activities in the Nighttown<br />\nsection alone would provide ample<br />\nchallenge for the serious animator.<br />\nThere remains the question of<br />\nartistic integrity, something I cannot answer. Would it be contrary<br />\nto Joyce's intentions to film<br />\nULYSSES? Should the novel, as<br />\nperfect art in itself, be denigrated<br />\nby transference to another medium? Well, Joyce never forbade<br />\nfilming, although he probably<br />\nwould have asked about it. Here<br />\nis where devotion to Joyce and<br />\nBloom is a factor: should they be<br />\nprotected from prostitution, pristinely preserved, or extended to<br />\npossibly wider and even enhancing<br />\naesthetic horizons?<br />\n1, for one, have the urge to<br />\nmake the ultimate Joyce film,<br />\ntrue in every exact detail, word,<br />\npunctuation point. Why? Partly<br />\nto give Joyce to more people,<br />\npartly because I identify with<br />\nBloom enough to wish him sprung<br />\ninto life, partly for inexplicable,<br />\nmaybe omphalogical reasons. In<br />\nany case, Joyce cannot, must not<br />\nbe filmed except by total representation. This is Strick's fault,<br />\nanimation's complementary hope.<br />\nWe thank Michael Hirsh, and<br />\nLeopold, for making it all so<br />\nhopeful.<br />\n<br />\nBlack Pride Wears Thin<br />\nBy JOEL ZISKIN<br />\nThe ultimate soul show was<br />\nhere.

The socalled free press is having a field<br />\nday with Kennedy. The Baltimore<br />\nSun cleverly disguised a front page<br />\neditorial on Kennedy in the form<br />\nof a new analysis.<br />\nThe primary charge against Senator Kennedy's candidacy revolves<br />\naround the idea that he is an opportunist who only entered the<br />\nrace after McCarthy demonstrated<br />\nthat Johnson was not as invulnerable as supposed. That view rests<br />\nupon the absurd assumption that<br />\nthe Senator is now a shoo-in to unseat LBJ. Kennedy has put his<br />\ncareer on the line, not only nationally, but even in his home state of<br />\nNew York. Moreover, he has pledged himself not to support Johnson even if his presidential drive<br />\nshould fail. This is opportunism?<br />\nOf course, the New Hampshire<br />\nresults figured in his decision, but<br />\nthis was not his prime reason for<br />\nentering the race.<br />\nJohnson's decision to disregard<br />\nthe changing American consensus<br />\non the Vietnam War and to send<br />\n<br />\nthe additional<br />\nWestmoreland<br />\ntroops he'requested also was an<br />\nimportant factor. The President's<br />\nunreceptive attitude towards the<br />\nKerner Report, perhaps, played an<br />\neven larger part in convincing the<br />\nSenator that the nation would<br />\nface doom if LBJ was again the<br />\nDemocratic nominee.<br />\nThe New Hampshire vote did<br />\nnot automatically give McCarthy<br />\na mandate to receive the nomination. As reported in the New York<br />\nTimes, the McCarthy vote was not<br />\nan anti-war vote, but generally an<br />\nanti-Johnson response by the people of that state. Fifty per cent of<br />\nMcCarthy's voters indicated that<br />\nthey did not even know what position the Minnesota senator held in<br />\nregard to the war.<br />\nWhat is McCarthy's position on<br />\nthe war? People call him a dove<br />\nbut nobody seems sure of exactly<br />\nhow McCarthy would extricate us<br />\nfrom Southeast Asia. Kennedy's<br />\nposition is clear and was restated<br />\nat Kansas State on Monday. He<br />\nwould halt bombing of the North,<br />\ndrastically reduce our military<br />\ncommitment, and begin negotiations with the NLF. Hubert Humphrey branded Kennedy a turncoat because the Senator had supported the war effort in 1962<br />\nwhen he was a member of the<br />\nNational Security Council. One<br />\nmight ask what position McCarthy<br />\nhad taken at that time and how he<br />\nhad voted when the Gulf of Tonkin<br />\nresolution was passed by the Senate in 1964. Did McCarthy have<br />\nthe backbone at that time to take<br />\n<br />\na stand against the war? Kennedy<br />\nhas courageously admitted that he<br />\nwas in error, and this realization<br />\ndidn't just materialize last week,<br />\nbut has been a major aspect of his<br />\npolicy for the past three years.<br />\nKennedy's stand on the war does<br />\nnot \"destroy\" the peace movement as many McCarthy and Johnson supporters have contended.<br />\nIt adds new strength and a fresher<br />\napproach to the problems presented by Vietnam.<br />\nThe success of McCarthy's campaign hinges on the single issue of<br />\nthe war, and has rarely touched<br />\nupon other areas of national conoffers broadly<br />\ncern. Kennedy<br />\nbased policies which challenge the<br />\nsagging program of Johnson's in all<br />\nareas. In addition, Kennedy is a<br />\nproven campaigner who possesses<br />\nan organization loaded with talent<br />\nfrom the days of 1960.<br />\nMcCarthy is to be congratulated<br />\nfor his efforts against Johnson. It<br />\nwould be unrealistic to expect him<br />\nto give up his quest until the primaries have shown who can really<br />\nwin popular support to stop LBJ.<br />\nBut the accusations of the press<br />\nagainst Kennedy have to be considered in their true light and in<br />\nthe light of the uphill fight which<br />\nthe New York Senator faces.

But when<br />\nthe festivities were all over and the<br />\njunior senator had descended from<br />\nthe hill after having delivered<br />\nhis pronouncements to the faithful, the heavens did not seem the<br />\nbetter for his effort.

What they count on<br />\nis themselves. A question I am<br />\ncontinually asked this year is just<br />\nwhat the '68 stickmen are like<br />\ncompared to last year's champions.<br />\nPerhaps unfairly, I counter with<br />\nmy own question: what were we<br />\nlike last year \u2014 were we the team<br />\nthat demolished the world champion Mt. Washington Wolfpack<br />\n10-4, or the lackluster group that<br />\nsuccumbed to Maryland 9-5?<br />\nFour cripples took the field<br />\nagainst Navy yet they never stopped running and did what no college team had done for three years:<br />\nbeat Navy.Perhaps the meaning of<br />\nthat moment was best expressed<br />\nwhen Bill Dietrich picked up Jerry<br />\nSchneidman and hugged him out<br />\nof sheer joy. Dietrich might well<br />\nhave hugged everyone for above<br />\nall, on that rainy Saturday Hopkins<br />\nhad played as a team: Coach Scott<br />\nawarded everyone a game ball.<br />\nSeven days later we were a different team. Never, in the history<br />\nof sport, was there a sadder place<br />\nthan the Hopkins locker room. To<br />\nsee Jerry Schneidman, who had<br />\nplayed his heart out, fight back<br />\nthe tears that chocked the entire<br />\nteam was one of the worst experiences of my life.<br />\nWe all remember 1967. But if<br />\n<br />\n1968 is to have a better ending we<br />\nmust remember why Maryland<br />\nhappened. I believe that Hopkins<br />\nwas the better team but on that<br />\nhot and dusty afternoon Maryland<br />\nwanted to win and they did. Hopkins must want to win. They must<br />\nremember Joe Cowan taking the<br />\nfield on one leg against the AllAmerican defenseman. They must<br />\nremember Jerry Schneidman playing with blood in his eyes at Maryland and Bobby Carter and Charlie<br />\nGoodell running with one good<br />\nknee between them. The '68 team<br />\nmust see again Hank Kaestner's<br />\ngolden stick in the 4th quarter<br />\nagainst Army and the horse shoe<br />\nthat fell out of John Cardillo's<br />\npocket when he scored against<br />\nNavy. They have to close their<br />\neyes and feel the ground shake<br />\nonce again; they must remember<br />\nhow the cannon was drowned out<br />\nby the 15,000 fans on Homewood<br />\nField the day of the Navy Game.<br />\nThese are moments they can be<br />\nproud of, These are moments they<br />\nworked for and deserved. But<br />\nwhat they also must remember is<br />\nhow bitter defeat tasted and how<br />\nBilly Dietrich or Wayne Towns or<br />\neven Bobby Sopka felt when the<br />\nMaryland game was over, and they<br />\nrealized that never could they play<br />\nfor Hopkins again.<br />\n<br />\nCaptain Jim Werner, looking<br />\nover a roster that includes six<br />\nreturning lettermen, went out on<br />\na limb this week to predict an<br />\n8-2 record for the varsity golf<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe linksmen, 5-6 last season,<br />\nopened practice over a month ago.<br />\nBack this year along with<br />\nWerner are two other seniors,<br />\nMarshall Paul and Pete Fredland,<br />\nand a trio of juniors, Dick Banjavic, Steve Goodman, and Bill<br />\nHughes.<br />\nFight for First<br />\nBanjavic played number one on<br />\nlast year's squad.

This provision would<br />\nserve to increase intra-school communication, to improve the attitude and atmosphere on campus,<br />\nand to encourage the flow of<br />\nideas. Present facilities were accused of being too few, possessing<br />\nlimited availability, and tending to<br />\nisolate various groups of people<br />\nwho already know each other.<br />\nChanges advocated to relieve this<br />\nsituation included special programs for students not in organized activities and the establishment<br />\nof new places for people to meet.<br />\nAnother significant complaint<br />\nstated that the University was not<br />\nproviding for the overall social<br />\nand cultural education of the<br />\nstudent, his -intellect, and the neglect of other important aspects of<br /><br />\nlife. The shortage of game rooms<br />\nand lounges was frequently mentioned, as was the need for more<br />\nand better athletic facilities.<br />\nOften recommended .to improve these deficiencies were the<br />\nrenovation and expansion of Levering Hall, repeatedly described as<br />\ninadequate, and the creation of a<br />\nstudent union to incorporate necessary activities. Due to varying<br />\nresponses as to what should be<br />\nincluded in such a student center,<br />\nthe CISF felt that deeper investigation of the possibility was<br />\nrequired.<br />\nThe committee also learned<br />\nthat two major problems were the<br />\nlack of centralization of existing<br />\nfacilities and the need to make all<br />\nrecreational services more available to students by increasing the<br />\ntime periods during which they<br />\nare open. Other grievances included the shortage of comfortable<br />\nstudy places and of cultural activities, such as art galleries and<br />\nstudios.<br />\nThe CISF did not offer any<br />\nsolutions but did make some<br />\ngeneral recommendations, stating<br />\nthat fuller investigation was necessary and that a greater survey of<br />\nopinion on the campus should be<br />\nobtained.<br /><br />\nSA Plans Conference<br /><br />\nThe Student Association will<br />\nHopkins Freshman Paul Hearn hold a major metropolitan-wide<br />\nwas elected Secretary of Region \"Conference on Student InvolveIll of the College Young Republi- ment in the City\" on Saturday,<br />\ncans during their annual convent- April 6, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.<br />\nion held this past weekend in at Levering Hall.<br />\nStaunton.

Sloan<br /><br />\nPHOTOGRAPHY EDITOR<br />\nThomas V. Hoffman<br /><br />\nKennedy or McCarthy ?<br />\nRobert Kennedy's entrance into the presidential race poses a serious problem, particularly for the college student who was happily<br />\nsurprised last November when Senator Eugene McCarthy offered a<br />\nviable alternative to Lyndon Johnson. At stake is the future of the<br />\nfirst anti-war movement to arise within the legitimate political system of this country in regards to the War in Vietnam.<br />\nThe emotionalism surrounding Kennedy's decision, both pro and<br />\ncon, must be dispelled before judgment may be passed on his candidacy. Charges that Kennedy is opportunistic and a cut-throat politician are irrelevant, if not unfair. Just as McCarthy did last November,<br />\nKennedy's action has irrevocably put his political future in jeopardy,<br />\nboth nationally and in his home state of New York. We must agree<br />\nwith James Reston in saying that Kennedy felt he could no longer<br />\nkeep silent and that he entered the race on the conviction that he has<br />\na better chance of victory than McCarthy.<br />\nThe question we taCe now, is who to support, especially considering the fact that students have proven themselves to be an effective<br />\nforce, at least in the primary campaigns. Those who back Kennedy<br />\ninevitably offer the contention that Kennedy is a winner; McCarthy<br />\nis not. However, in considering this claim we must review the situation as it, stands now. McCarthy began a campaign, with little money<br />\nand virtually no outside support, and ended up heading a drive which<br />\namassed 42% of the Democratic votes in the New Hampshire Primary.<br />\nMoreover, analysts are predicting a possible McCarthy victory in<br />\nWisconsin. As for Kennedy, the situation has changed considerably<br />\nsince the \"Kennedy Boom\" of a year ago. Kennedy, by his inaction,<br />\nhas alienated a substantial segment of his following. There is no indication that he has inherited, intact, the successful political machine<br />\nbuilt by his brother, the late President. At this time, he has failed<br />\nto mobilize significant support among party chieftains and influential figures. In short, McCarthy has proven his ability to win and to<br />\nlead the antiwar movement. Kennedy's chances remain theoretical<br />\nand are still doubtful.<br />\nOn this basis, we continue to support Eugene McCarthy for the<br />\npresidency and we urge those who have been politically active in his<br />\ncampaign to honor their previous committment to him. Only if the<br />\nMcCarthy drive should falter in the late primaries or at the convention<br />\ncould we see a reassessment in favor of Kennedy.<br /><br />\nNewsprint Poverty Pocket<br />\nAt Hopkins, where the concept of \"community\" is a popular<br />\nmyth, despite the flowery claims of our catalogue which are so far<br />\nfrom the truth that they border on obscenity, there remains one<br />\nmedium which comes relatively close to providing a common meeting place for the undergraduate \u2022body - - student publications. There<br />\nhave been many other fantasy-plans, which either haven't worked or<br />\nweren't implemented, meant to make the community a reality. That<br />\na true community has never materialized is another conformation of<br />\nthe common knowledge that the undergraduate body is low on the<br />\nlist of the University's priorities.<br />\nThe few student publications which survive (or rather, subsist) at<br />\nHopkins form the most necessary segment of a potential community<br />\n- - communication of news and ideas. Yet, these same publications<br />\neither face failure or can't fulfill their potential due to the prevalent<br />\nAdministration attitude towards undergraduate affairs.<br />\nThe recent incident concerning the Vector symboliies this sorepoint. The Vector is a high quality magazine which has been an admirable example of an undergraduate publication. It may be true<br />\nthat its staff was far from faultless in planning its budget. However,<br />\nthe Administration does not seem to be in any rush to insure the<br />\nsurvival of the Vector or to make possible the maintenance of its<br />\nhigh standards. The Charles Street Review, which is attempting an<br />\nambitious revival, faces similar financial problems. The _News-Letter<br />\nborders on a situation where it must subordinate copy demands to<br />\naccomodate the overabundant advertising which is necessary to compensate for the lack of University funds.<br />\nThese publications comprise a major part of few signs of undergraduate life -on campus. The funds necessary to put all campus publications on a comfortable basis would be minute compared to other<br />\nexpenditures. It narrows down to a basic question of whether the<br />\nUniversity really cares whether these few signs of life survive or not.<br />\nThe undergraduate body would certainly benefit from a Vector<br />\nwhich could afford to come out bi-monthly, a Charles Street Review<br />\nwhich could come out quarterly, and a News-Letter which could<br />\nafford to expand its coverage of relevant events. Though these may<br />\nbe pipe-dreams, we still await some indication from the Administration that it gives a damn.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MARCH 22,1968<br /><br />\nBy LEO MANGLAVITTI<br />\n(Bloom walks on a net, covers<br />\nhis left eye with his left ear,<br />\npasses through several walls, climbs<br />\nNelson's Pillar, hangs from the<br />\ntop ledge by his eyelids, eats<br />\ntwelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals. several sufferers<br />\nfrom king's evil, contracts his<br />\nface so as to resemble many historical personages, . . . turns each<br />\nfoot simultaneously in different<br />\ndirections, bids the tide turn back,<br />\neclipses the sun by extending his<br />\nlittle finger.)<br />\nJoseph Strick's ULYSSES is a<br />\n')ad film. It has taken me exactly<br />\nJne year to admit what an inordinate affection for Joyce and his<br />\nBloomepic had previously kept<br />\nme from admitting. Whereas many<br />\ncritics, myself included, were willing to credit Strick with a good<br />\njob for what he attempted, they<br />\nall cited the book's unfilmability<br />\nas a hindrance to the film's success. Now I admit that hindrance<br />\nis enough to invalidate the film.<br />\nMichael Hirsh,film-maker,summed it up last Saturday: \"To<br />\nsomeone who has not read the<br />\nnovel, the film is senseless. To<br />\nsomeone who has read the novel,<br />\nthe film is insignificant.\" This is<br />\nso self-evidently true that debate<br />\nshould end here. If only on the<br />\nlevel of unfilmable happenings,<br />\nlike the physical virtuosity quoted<br />\nabove, let alone the stream of<br /><br />\nconsciousness complexity, filming<br />\nJoyce must constitute an emasculation of his art.<br />\nBut Hirsh may provide a compromise. He explained a new technique he is developing for the<br />\ncombined use of animation and<br />\nlive action to make more realistic<br />\nthe Gestallt psychological effect<br />\nin frame-splitting (showing many<br />\nactions simultaneously). Witlmethods too complicated to be<br />\ndiscussed here, Hirsh hopes to<br />\ncreate a real-unreal montage interworking of the conscious and<br />\nsubconscious levels of visual perception. The total effect for the<br />\nviewer is an expanded participation in the film as the live<br />\naction and animation coalesce into<br />\na perceivable whole.<br />\nWhy not use total animation?<br />\nInformally, later, half hanging out<br />\nof a rainswept window, Hirsh<br />\nagreed that Joyce could be filmed<br />\nonly in animation. Earlier he had<br />\nshown some 1935 Disney cartoons, with scripts by then-budding writers, William Burroughs and<br />\nSamuel Beckett .The literally absurd antics of Donald and Mickey,<br />\nvictims of the Burroughs-Becket<br />\nphantasmagoria, have effect only<br />\nin animation. But Disney is dead,<br />\nand the cheap, pseudo-animation<br />\nof Huckleberry Hound is in vogue.<br />\nThe days of animation as a true<br />\nart form may never be again.<br />\nULYSSES would be a perfect<br />\nsubject for a cartoon renaissance.<br />\nThis is not meant to insult Joyce's<br /><br />\nachievement. If the book is to be<br />\nfilmed, the fantastic exploits of<br />\nBloom and company, like the<br />\nDisney fantasies, could only be<br />\ndone in animation. The unfilmable<br />\narray of characters and their bizarre activities in the Nighttown<br />\nsection alone would provide ample<br />\nchallenge for the serious animator.<br />\nThere remains the question of<br />\nartistic integrity, something I cannot answer. Would it be contrary<br />\nto Joyce's intentions to film<br />\nULYSSES? Should the novel, as<br />\nperfect art in itself, be denigrated<br />\nby transference to another medium? Well, Joyce never forbade<br />\nfilming, although he probably<br />\nwould have asked about it. Here<br />\nis where devotion to Joyce and<br />\nBloom is a factor: should they be<br />\nprotected from prostitution, pristinely preserved, or extended to<br />\npossibly wider and even enhancing<br />\naesthetic horizons?<br />\n1, for one, have the urge to<br />\nmake the ultimate Joyce film,<br />\ntrue in every exact detail, word,<br />\npunctuation point. Why? Partly<br />\nto give Joyce to more people,<br />\npartly because I identify with<br />\nBloom enough to wish him sprung<br />\ninto life, partly for inexplicable,<br />\nmaybe omphalogical reasons. In<br />\nany case, Joyce cannot, must not<br />\nbe filmed except by total representation. This is Strick's fault,<br />\nanimation's complementary hope.<br />\nWe thank Michael Hirsh, and<br />\nLeopold, for making it all so<br />\nhopeful.<br /><br />\nBlack Pride Wears Thin<br />\nBy JOEL ZISKIN<br />\nThe ultimate soul show was<br />\nhere.

The socalled free press is having a field<br />\nday with Kennedy. The Baltimore<br />\nSun cleverly disguised a front page<br />\neditorial on Kennedy in the form<br />\nof a new analysis.<br />\nThe primary charge against Senator Kennedy's candidacy revolves<br />\naround the idea that he is an opportunist who only entered the<br />\nrace after McCarthy demonstrated<br />\nthat Johnson was not as invulnerable as supposed. That view rests<br />\nupon the absurd assumption that<br />\nthe Senator is now a shoo-in to unseat LBJ. Kennedy has put his<br />\ncareer on the line, not only nationally, but even in his home state of<br />\nNew York. Moreover, he has pledged himself not to support Johnson even if his presidential drive<br />\nshould fail. This is opportunism?<br />\nOf course, the New Hampshire<br />\nresults figured in his decision, but<br />\nthis was not his prime reason for<br />\nentering the race.<br />\nJohnson's decision to disregard<br />\nthe changing American consensus<br />\non the Vietnam War and to send<br /><br />\nthe additional<br />\nWestmoreland<br />\ntroops he'requested also was an<br />\nimportant factor. The President's<br />\nunreceptive attitude towards the<br />\nKerner Report, perhaps, played an<br />\neven larger part in convincing the<br />\nSenator that the nation would<br />\nface doom if LBJ was again the<br />\nDemocratic nominee.<br />\nThe New Hampshire vote did<br />\nnot automatically give McCarthy<br />\na mandate to receive the nomination. As reported in the New York<br />\nTimes, the McCarthy vote was not<br />\nan anti-war vote, but generally an<br />\nanti-Johnson response by the people of that state. Fifty per cent of<br />\nMcCarthy's voters indicated that<br />\nthey did not even know what position the Minnesota senator held in<br />\nregard to the war.<br />\nWhat is McCarthy's position on<br />\nthe war? People call him a dove<br />\nbut nobody seems sure of exactly<br />\nhow McCarthy would extricate us<br />\nfrom Southeast Asia. Kennedy's<br />\nposition is clear and was restated<br />\nat Kansas State on Monday. He<br />\nwould halt bombing of the North,<br />\ndrastically reduce our military<br />\ncommitment, and begin negotiations with the NLF. Hubert Humphrey branded Kennedy a turncoat because the Senator had supported the war effort in 1962<br />\nwhen he was a member of the<br />\nNational Security Council. One<br />\nmight ask what position McCarthy<br />\nhad taken at that time and how he<br />\nhad voted when the Gulf of Tonkin<br />\nresolution was passed by the Senate in 1964. Did McCarthy have<br />\nthe backbone at that time to take<br /><br />\na stand against the war? Kennedy<br />\nhas courageously admitted that he<br />\nwas in error, and this realization<br />\ndidn't just materialize last week,<br />\nbut has been a major aspect of his<br />\npolicy for the past three years.<br />\nKennedy's stand on the war does<br />\nnot \"destroy\" the peace movement as many McCarthy and Johnson supporters have contended.<br />\nIt adds new strength and a fresher<br />\napproach to the problems presented by Vietnam.<br />\nThe success of McCarthy's campaign hinges on the single issue of<br />\nthe war, and has rarely touched<br />\nupon other areas of national conoffers broadly<br />\ncern. Kennedy<br />\nbased policies which challenge the<br />\nsagging program of Johnson's in all<br />\nareas. In addition, Kennedy is a<br />\nproven campaigner who possesses<br />\nan organization loaded with talent<br />\nfrom the days of 1960.<br />\nMcCarthy is to be congratulated<br />\nfor his efforts against Johnson. It<br />\nwould be unrealistic to expect him<br />\nto give up his quest until the primaries have shown who can really<br />\nwin popular support to stop LBJ.<br />\nBut the accusations of the press<br />\nagainst Kennedy have to be considered in their true light and in<br />\nthe light of the uphill fight which<br />\nthe New York Senator faces. He<br />\nmay not win, but his efforts do<br />\nshow that his decision was an<br />\nhonest one which developed from<br />\na deep concern for our decaying<br />\nnation.<br />\nD.A.E.<br /><br />\nAuld Lang Syne<br />\nBy JAMES BENNETT<br />\nThe time is ten o'clock Saturday morning and the Senate<br />\nCaucus Room is filled to capacity<br />\nwith elbow-jabbing reporters.
