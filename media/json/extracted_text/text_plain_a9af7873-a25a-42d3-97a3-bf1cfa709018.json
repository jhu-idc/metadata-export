It s commander, John Young, a veteran of<br />\nthe Apollo and Gemini programs,<br />\nand pilot, Robert Crippen, receiving<br />\nhis initiation into space, are the first<br />\nAmericans to leave the Earth since the<br />\n1975 Apollo-Soyuz link-up. With them,<br />\nvicariously, went many of the 1500 accredited newsmen and million-plus onlookers crowded onto or near the base and,<br />\npresumably, millions more watching on televisions around the country and world.<br />\nFriday, April 10, 10 a.m. STS-1, the first<br />\ntest of the- Space Transportation System, is<br />\nscrubbed for the day and tentatively rescheduled<br />\nfor Sunday. The problem? the backup computer<br />\nwas not talking to the four primary computers/<br />\nrepeated tests had failed to find anything wrong in the<br />\nbackup software, and the hardware itself was not in<br />\nquestion. It would late be learned that the programs in<br />\ntwo of the four primary computers, all of which were supposed to be identical, were in fact very slightly different; this<br />\ncaused a time delay that prevented their communication with<br />\nthe backup, although it caused no problem in communication<br />\nwith each other--another thing to be added to the check off list for<br />\nfuture countdowns.<br />\nFriday, April 10,10 a.m. Over one million disappointed people<br />\ntry to depart from the area, photographers and soundmen take down their<br />\nsetups, hoping for a go on Sunday. We just took our cameras down, we<br />\ndidn't say very much. The silence was deafening... Many people had crept<br />\nthrough miles of backed up traffic eight hours earlier. Some, unable to take another day's leave, will not be back. Among the newsmen, many who had been there<br />\non Thursday slept in their cars to avoid traffic. Some who had left their off-base lodgings at 2:30 would have missed seeing lift-off from the press sites, had it occurred on time.<br />\nThey would know better for their return Sunday.<br />\nSunday morning,T minus 1:30:40 and counting: Young and Crippen are not getting oxygen into<br />\ntheir suits. The problem is fonnd to be a inis-sealed quick release .attachment on the oxygen lines.<br />\nThe problem is fixed, the countdown continues.<br />\nT minus 9 minutes: A built-in hold period, and everything was go at this point on Friday, until it<br />\nwas found that the computers were not communicating. There had been an apparent problem in the number<br />\nthree fuel cell, too much hydrogen, but it was later disclosed that that was quite temporary and actually was a part of<br />\nthe normal functioning.<br />\nT minus 8 minutes 59 seconds and counting: An enormous cheer and much applause at the press site as the<br />\ncountdown resumes. The press are at least as enthusiastic as the million or so others who have come to witness the rebirth of man's<br />\nquest for the stars and for truth. Pubic i and press, are all here for the same reasons. The advantage of being the press is that we have the<br />\nbest seats. Why are we here; Public, press, we want to be here, we asked for the assignment, many, perhaps most of us have been here<br />\nbefore, too many years ago. The fact that there are men up there makes a difference. We know what it's like to be here, we wish we could<br />\nexplain what it's like but words, even pictures are inadequate. I want to leave the ground myself before! die.<br />\nT minus 7 minutes? You can feel the tension and anticipation in the air. There is going to be a launch. A camera and sound crew from Walt Disney<br />\nand another \u2022 one from IMAX, the people who made\"To Fly'', for the Smithsonian Aerospace Museum, are here recording this launch on 35mm and IMAX film<br />\nrespectively. The Disney crew has a digital recorder and microphones flat down to 0 cycles per second only 1200 feet from ground zero. Will they survive the<br />\nanticipated 152 decibel sound pressure level at that site? Three miles away at the press site, the anticipated sound level is 138 dB.<br />\nT minus 2 minutes and counting? Another cheer erupts. As each minute turns over on the countdown clock, the cheers have become louder and more<br />\nenthusiastic.<br />\nAbout 1 second before 7, ignition, a cheer and a roar of shutters clicking. A couple seconds later, a rushing sound. Too early for engine blast, maybe it's<br />\nthe thousands of gallons of water being sprayed into the pad as part of the noise suppression system for the launch.<br />\nLift off. The flame is bigger than I, a veteran of four Saturn V launches, had expected.Then the roar of the engines comes at about the<br />\ntime the shuttle clears the launch tower. And it keeps getting louder. Maybe your ears have been more vigorousl<br />\nassaulted at rock concerts but the sound here is concentrated around 16 hertz, slightly<br />\nbelow the lower limit of human hearing. It's incredibly loud, but it<br />\ndoesn't sound as loud as we might expect because our<br />\nears can't here that frequency. I remember taking<br />\nsome photos before and after it.

Her husband handed her a red and black<br />\nhotdog that glistened in the sun and was still feisty<br />\nenough, away from the grill, to crackle and spit. She<br />\ntook the hotdog out of its covering, put it on a paper<br />\nplate, and watched it slide in its black, grease drippings<br />\nas she walked to the bridge table. On it was a plastic jar<br />\nfilled to the top with brown mustard and next to it a jar<br />\nwith relish. She put her plate down and stood in front<br />\nof the jars. The ladles were sinking into the mustard and<br />\nrelish mountains and she stirred them in a circle. She<br />\nretrieved her plate and poured enough mustard and<br />\nrelish on her one dog for three. After she had sufficiently suffocated it, she raised it to her mouth and bit into<br />\nit. Mustard and relish exploded in her mouth and she<br />\ndropped her plate. She lunged at the jars, clutched the<br />\nladles, flung them away, and poured the relish container<br />\nover head. She then loosened her shorts and made<br />\nroom for the landslide of mustard. By the time her \u2022<br />\nhusband had noticed her, she had almost stripped and a<br />\nmound of relish was sitting on top of her head like an<br />\nemerald crown. As she shot away, her crown fell apart<br />\nand the mustard streaming down her thighs, streaked her<br />\nlegs. She ran across a field and her husband watched her<br />\nuntil she looked like a speck falling off the edge of the<br />\nworld. She reached a road which she tried to cross, but<br />\ncollapsed during the attempt. The woman baked in the<br />\nsun until it was ready to set and when she woke,her left<br />\nside was burning and swelled from the pain. She looked<br />\nup the road and saw a brown truck cutting through the<br />\nripples of heat. When it reached her she saw its dangling<br />\nfender and scraped sides. Two girls jumped out of the<br />\ntruck and ran to the body in the middle of their path.<br />\n\"You think she's alive?\" asked a skinny girl with<br />\ncharcoal red braids.<br />\n\"I think so, her back's goin' up and down,\" her<br />\ntwin sister said.<br />\n\"She aint got no clothes on. She looks like she's<br />\nbeen in a swamp or somethin'.\"<br />\nOne of the twins kicked the woman's thighs and<br />\nshe commanded enough of her muscles to look up at<br />\nthem.<br />\n\"She aint sayin' nothin'. Hey you got a name?\"<br />\nThe woman tried to brush the relish out of her<br />\nhair, but the sun had baked it into her scalp. She<br />\nsupported her weight on the palms of her hands.<br />\n\"Whatta we do with her?\"<br />\n\"I dunno,\" the twin with the braids shrugged.<br />\n\"Maybe we should clean her up. Hey you wanna<br />\nget cleaned up?\"<br />\nThe woman collapsed again and hit her head<br />\nagainst the pavement. The right side of her forehead<br />\nswelled into a red and rocky bump. Suddenly, the<br />\nwoman began to twitch as if she had been jolted by a<br />\njagged thunderbolt.<br />\n\"Let's get her in the truck,\" the twin with the<br />\nbraids said.<br />\nEach took an arm and dragged the woman into<br />\nthe truck--their local paper's refurbished delivery truck<br />\nand they threw her in like a sack of flour. Night fell out<br />\nof the sky and the twins drove off with their find. The<br />\nroad sent its bumps through .the woman's body and she<br />\nknew she was in motion. The twins chattered in the<br />\nfront and the woman could only sort out a disconnected<br />\nword or phrase from the bulk of their conversation.<br />\nThey drove until the first set of stars broke through the<br />\nsky's black film.<br />\n\"We're here, naked lady,\" a twin called to her.<br />\nHere, was a patch of land that stood next to a<br />\nriver bank. They parked the heisted delivery truck and<br />\nunloaded their passenger much the same way the rightful<br />\ndriver of the truck unloaded his newspapers. The<br />\nwoman tried to deduce her location unsuccessfully.<br />\nWhy would these strange girls take to river? she thought,<br />\nas she sat on a pile of wet leaves and watched the twins<br />\ncollect branches.<br />\n\"We gotta enough for a bonfire,\" the twin with<br />\nthe braids said.<br />\n\"Let's bring 'em to the beach,\" the other said.<br />\n\"You run ahead, Sis.\"<br />\nThey're going to roast me like a hotdog, the<br />\nwoman thought.<br />\n\"Come on, naked lady.

A little bit later in life,<br />\nnone of the three sisters could even have told you that<br />\nthey was ever visited. They just sort of felt a little<br />\nempty.

He came home one<br />\nnight hatin himself so much he beat up his little girls.<br />\nCame just short of killin em. Made em all swear never to<br />\ngive up they bodies to any man.

When it never came back they filled<br />\nthey need for the spirit with they daddy.

No fantasy is<br />\nas familiar to the English-speaking world as<br />\nthe cycle of Arthurian legends, but until<br />\nnow no film has fairly presented it.<br />\nCamelot lapsed into saccharine romanticism; Robert Bresson's Lancelot of the<br />\nLake was austere and bleak to the point<br />\nof dullness; and although George Lucas<br />\nborrowed much of the mythic strength in<br />\nStar Wars from the Arthurian stories, a<br />\nderivation is definitely not the original.<br />\nJohn Boorman's Excalihur, a loose but<br />\nfaithful adaptation of Sir Thomas<br />\nMalory's Le Morte D'Arthur, is a shining<br />\ntriumph--a film which captures the<br />\npowerful essence of the Arthurian tales.<br />\nThere are two major stumbling<br />\nblocks which staid in the way of filming<br />\nthe Arthur story: (1) presenting the<br />\nentire legend within the time limits of a<br />\nfeature-length film, and (2) telling a story<br />\nwith which the audience is already<br />\nintimately familiar and making it work.<br />\nBy juggling characters and events<br />\nBoorman compresses the Arthur legend<br />\ninto 140 minutes, but despite the literary<br />\nsleight-of-hand necessary to do this none<br />\nof the important themes of Malory's<br />\nstory are lost. Galahad's character is<br />\ndeleted, and instead Perceval succeeds in<br />\nfinding the Grail. The quest for the Grail<br />\nis in turn secularized into a search for<br />\nsocio-political salvation rather than<br />\nreligious redemption--a piece of dramatic<br />\nlicense which fits in better with the rest<br />\nof the narrative than Malory's sudden<br />\n<br />\ngear-change into religious propagandizing.<br />\nThe Grail, like Excalibur, becomes a<br />\nsymbol of political authority legitimized<br />\nby supernatural powers. Incest and<br />\nadultery are still see . as politically<br />\nundermining forces, but it is Morgan le<br />\nFay who seduces Arthur with her sorcery<br />\nand produces Mordred, rather than<br />\nMordred being the disastrous offspring of<br />\nArthur inadvertantly sleeping with his<br />\naunt Margawse. Lancelot and Guenevere<br />\nhave their adulterous fling, but they later<br />\ndo penance for their actions and do not<br />\ncause the destruction of the Round<br />\nTable. Lancelot is a sympathetic character wishing to be purged of his love for<br />\nGuenevere, and, realizing the destructive<br />\npotential of their romance, he deliberately stays away from the court. His role<br />\nas savior is retained in Excalihur, symbolized by a wound received from falling on<br />\nhis sword which parallels Christ's wound<br />\non the cross. Details are changed in<br />\n<br />\nBoorman's version of Malory, but the<br />\nunderlying importance of the events and<br />\ncharacters is not.<br />\nWhat is truly dazzling about<br />\nExcalihur is Boorman's graphic treatment<br />\nof the story, a strange blend of realism<br />\nand fantasy. The initial scenes--craggy,<br />\nbrooding castles overlooking a turbulent,<br />\nslate-grey sea; the dark figures of battling<br />\nknights silhouetted against the background of a burning town; a crowd of<br />\ngrimy peasants watching jousting knights<br />\nhurling each other into the mud--are<br />\ngritty and dingy enough to be from the<br />\nDark Ages, or what we would imagine the<br />\nDark Ages to have been like. Boorman's<br />\nrepresentation of this period is not<br />\nhistorically accurate, but instead it is<br />\nwhat our mind's eye visualizes it to have<br />\nbeen. Apart from this pseudo-realism is<br />\nthe element of the purely fantastic: the<br />\narmor of the Round Table knights gleams<br />\nand glistens like stainless steel; Camelot is<br />\na fortress of silver and gold built from a<br />\nblueprint of high fantasy; Merlin creates a<br />\nprismatic spray of spells conjured out of<br />\n'dreams. Realism is unnecessary for a<br />\nsuspension of disbelief here. What we are<br />\n<br />\nNigel Terry as King Arthur in Excalibur<br />\n<br />\nNight OfMusicalXTC<br />\nBY GEORGE YATCHISIN<br />\nThe public doesn't know what it's<br />\nmissed. Friday night at the Painter's Mill<br />\nTheatre a less than half full auditorium<br />\nwas treated to musical XTC (pun intended). Sadly, the British New Wave<br />\ngroup couldn't sell out the hall, but the<br />\npeople to feel sorry for are those who<br />\ndidn't go. XTC had the joint jumpin' and<br />\nfor a great reason--live and on vinyl, it is<br />\namong the most talented groups in rock.<br />\nEverything was nearly perfect<br />\nwith XTC, beginning with group leader,<br />\nguitarist Andy Partridge. Partridge writes<br />\nand sings most of XTC's songs, but even<br />\nwhen not singing lead, he still is the<br />\ncenter of attention. He's not attractive,<br />\nand he doesn't move around extravagantly; he lust plays.<br />\nBassist Colin Moulding, writer and<br />\nof the group's two pseudosinger<br />\nlead<br />\nhits, \"Making Plans for Nigel\" and<br />\n\"Generals and Majors,\" is what Benjamin<br />\nOrr of the Cars tries to be: the second<br />\nman who can step out front and take<br />\nover. If Orr were half as good at it as<br />\nMoulding, the Cars would be tolerable in<br />\nconcert.<br />\nIt is important not to ignore the<br />\nTerry<br />\nof drummer<br />\ncontributions<br />\nChambers and lead guitarist Dave<br />\nGregory. On stage, Chambers appears to<br />\nbe the most eccentric of the eccentrics.<br />\nOften lit through the drum kit, he<br />\napppears all angles and madly moving<br />\nelbows, giving XTC a drive most bands<br />\nlack. Gregory doesn't get much solo<br />\nspace, but given a few bars, he can lay<br />\ndown a line that sounds_ almost non-<br />\n<br />\nguitarish. In concert he also fiddles with<br />\nkeyboards, his total work creating the<br />\nsounds that separate XTC from other<br />\nbands.<br />\nTechnically, things also went<br />\nThe sound, which never<br />\nsmoothly.<br />\nachieved the right mix between the treble<br />\nand bass during the two opening acts (a<br />\nredundant, tolerable Joan Jett and an<br />\nincomprehensible, interesting, but insignificant Jools Holland from Squeeze),<br />\nfinally reached the proper balance during<br />\nXTC. The light show reminded one of<br />\nAndy Warhol's Plastic Inevitable-numerous projections onto a large screen<br />\nbehind the drummer with varying sheets<br />\nof pastels, something directly out of a<br />\n960's psychedelic club.<br />\nXTC didn't play for long, centering its song selection on its last two<br />\nalbums, Drums and Wires and Black Sea.<br />\nOpening with a letter perfect \"Real by<br />\nReel,\" the band slipped right into \"Life<br />\nBegins at the Hop,\" a semi-parodic view<br />\nof the life and music of the Fifties.<br />\nThese two songs set the mood for the<br />\nnight--the group was here to play, but<br />\nmost of all to have fun, and by the end of<br />\nthe night everyone was having fun with<br />\nthem.<br />\n'A highlight for the boisterous<br />\ncrowd occurred when Partridge called the<br />\nhouse security off a man dancing on the<br />\nfront of the stage. Soon more than half<br />\nthe crowd scrambled onto the stage,<br />\nscreaming and jumping like a punked<br />\nmolecule. XTC seemed to eat it up, and<br />\nits performance the rest of the night was<br />\nfueled by the fans only feet away.<br />\nMusical highlights included the<br />\n<br />\nINIM1111111111111111=1111<br />\n<br />\nlooking for is a mythic truth, not a<br />\nhistorical one, and Boorman's delivery is<br />\nso striking that we are carried off into a<br />\nworld of legendary \"reality.\"<br />\nTechnically, Excalibur is a gem.<br />\nThe jousts and battle scenes are excellently choreographed and quite believable, and the armor and weapons, albeit fantastic in design, are realistic in the<br />\ncontext of what we expect them to be<br />\nlike.<br />\nThe special effects, including<br />\nMerlin's myriad of spells and the Lady of<br />\nthe Lake holding Excalibur aloft from the<br />\nface of a glass-smooth pond, are flawlessly crafted. The technical precision<br />\nmakes the fantasy complete. At no time<br />\ndoes it seem that these are merely actors<br />\ndressed in mock armor pretending to be<br />\nknights of the Round Table--these are the<br />\nembodiments of the mythic form of<br />\nArthur's knights, and the technical<br />\nexpertise of the film is necessary to make<br />\nthe fantasy \"believable.\"<br />\nThe synthesis of Boorman's direction and the actors' suitability to their<br />\nroles make the characters come alive.<br />\nNicol Williamson as Merlin is the most<br />\noutstanding figure in the film, a paradoxical combination of inhuman sorcery and<br />\nparanormal sagacity on one hand and<br />\ntragically human foolishness on the other.<br />\nMerlin's voice ranges from eager whispers<br />\nto furious shouting to excited giggling,<br />\nand even though he doddles a bit, an aura<br />\not power radiates from him.

PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nNicholson Grits His Teeth<br />\n<br />\nRafelson's Postman Rings True<br />\nBY DAN VITALE<br />\nIn filming his version of The<br />\nPostman Always Rings Twice, director<br />\nBob Rafelson has gone back to the original<br />\nsource: James M. Cain's hard-boiled<br />\nbanned-in-Boston novella, first published<br />\nin 1934. The 1946 film version of<br />\nPostman, because of the restrictions of<br />\nthe Hays Code, had to tone down the<br />\nbook's violently sexual content, thus<br />\nrobbing the story of essential plot elecharacter motivations.<br />\nments and<br />\nRafelson, in remaining as faithful to<br />\nCain's vision as possible, has rendered,<br />\nwith a perfectionist's eye for detail, a<br />\ntaut, stark drama highlighted by excellent<br />\nperformances from Jack Nicholson and<br />\nJessica Lange in the lead roles.<br />\nThe story, set during the Depression, is simple, almost skeletal: Frank<br />\nChambers (Nicholson), a drifter, stops off<br />\nat a roadside cafe run by a Greek immigrant, Nick Papadalcis (John Colicos),<br />\nand his beautiful American wife, Cora<br />\n(Lange). Enticed both by Nick's offer of<br />\na job and his wife's sultry charm,<br />\nChambers decides to stay on. He seduces<br />\nCora, who is unhappy and desirous<br />\nof change, and together they plan Nick's<br />\nmurder and live happily ever after, or at<br />\nleast until the fates intervene. Playwright<br />\nDavid Mamet (Sexual Perversity in<br />\nChicago) has supplied Rafelson with a<br />\nterse, brooding script which, while not<br />\ncompletely faithful to Cain's novel,<br />\nretains much of its flavor.<br />\nRafelson (whose previous films<br />\ninclude Five Easy Pieces and The King of<br />\nMarvin Gardens), together with cinematographer Sven Nykvist (of Ingmar<br />\nBergman fame), has infused each scene of<br />\nthe film with a gritty, film noir look,<br />\nshooting exteriors in gray light and<br />\ninteriors in half-darkness. The sets, cars,<br />\ncostumes, and other incidentals are<br />\n1930's-accurate but not ostentatious,<br />\ngiving the film a grimy, lived-in quality as<br />\nopposed to a back-lot gloss.<br />\nThe acting is first-rate. Nicholson<br />\nhere gives a subdued, understated per-<br />\n<br />\nformance as Chambers, limiting his<br />\ninfamous repertoire of leers, sneers, and<br />\nother assorted facial acrobatics to mere<br />\nteeth-gritting and blank staring. Jessica<br />\nLange destroys all doubts about her<br />\nacting ability harbored by anyone who<br />\nremembers her in Dino DiLaurentis'<br />\nKing Kong fiasco, displaying remarkable<br />\ncontrol and sensuality in the pivotal role<br />\nof Cora. Perhaps the best praise one can<br />\ngive her is that she more than holds her<br />\nown in the scenes with Nicholson, who<br />\nusually dominates the screen like a<br />\nsequoia in a window box. John Colicos is<br />\nsufficiently greasy as Nick, and the<br />\nsupporting players are consistently effective.<br />\nThere are a few problems with the<br />\n<br />\nBoorman Waves His Magic Wand<br />\ncont. from p. 13<br />\nA minor weakness of Excalihur is<br />\nthe soundtrack, which occasionally makes<br />\nitself felt at the wrong moment and in the<br />\nwrong form. When Lancelot first sees<br />\nGuenevere, Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\"<br />\ntheme wafts through the scene, but,<br />\nappropriate though it may be, it sounds<br />\nrather trite. At other times, though, the<br />\nmusic is more effective: during some of<br />\nthe battle scenes, the action is punctuated<br />\nby a manic chorus shouting out a crazed<br />\nLatin litany.<br />\nThe greatest compliment which<br />\ncan be paid to Excalihur, though, is that<br />\nBoorman has succeeded in transferring<br />\nthe soul of the Arthurian epic to the<br />\nscreen. In terms of acting, direction,<br />\nplot, graphics, and technical craftsmanship, Boorman's film is superb, and he.<br />\nshows that he made the film with a love<br />\nfor the subject. Excalihur as a whole<br />\nsucceeds in its quest: with a wave of his<br />\ndirectorial staff, John Boorman has<br />\ntransformed the legends of King Arthur<br />\nand the knights of the Round Table into<br />\n,filmic reality.<br />\n<br />\nYou'll be amazed at all<br />\nthe opportunities and<br />\nadvantages the Army<br />\noffers men and women<br />\nwith BSN degrees:<br />\n\u2022 Excellent starting salaries and benefits, including a liberal vacation policy.<br />\n\u2022 Real opportunity for advancement and professional<br />\ngrowth\u2014every Army Nurse is a commissioned officer.<br />\n\u2022 No basic training for nurses; just a basic orientation<br />\ncourse to familiarize you with the Army Medical<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nID The chance to travel; time to do the things you enjoy.<br />\n\u2022 Opportunity to qualify for specialized roles, teaching<br />\nor additional education.<br />\nSee if you qualify.<br />\nCall collect to<br />\n<br />\n301-677-4891<br />\n<br />\nThe Army Nurse Corps.<br />\nFor more information, write:<br />\nThe Army Nurse Corps.<br />\nNortheast Region, U.S. Army Recruiting<br />\nFort George G.

It s commander, John Young, a veteran of<br />\nthe Apollo and Gemini programs,<br />\nand pilot, Robert Crippen, receiving<br />\nhis initiation into space, are the first<br />\nAmericans to leave the Earth since the<br />\n1975 Apollo-Soyuz link-up. With them,<br />\nvicariously, went many of the 1500 accredited newsmen and million-plus onlookers crowded onto or near the base and,<br />\npresumably, millions more watching on televisions around the country and world.<br />\nFriday, April 10, 10 a.m. STS-1, the first<br />\ntest of the- Space Transportation System, is<br />\nscrubbed for the day and tentatively rescheduled<br />\nfor Sunday. The problem? the backup computer<br />\nwas not talking to the four primary computers/<br />\nrepeated tests had failed to find anything wrong in the<br />\nbackup software, and the hardware itself was not in<br />\nquestion. It would late be learned that the programs in<br />\ntwo of the four primary computers, all of which were supposed to be identical, were in fact very slightly different; this<br />\ncaused a time delay that prevented their communication with<br />\nthe backup, although it caused no problem in communication<br />\nwith each other--another thing to be added to the check off list for<br />\nfuture countdowns.<br />\nFriday, April 10,10 a.m. Over one million disappointed people<br />\ntry to depart from the area, photographers and soundmen take down their<br />\nsetups, hoping for a go on Sunday. We just took our cameras down, we<br />\ndidn't say very much. The silence was deafening... Many people had crept<br />\nthrough miles of backed up traffic eight hours earlier. Some, unable to take another day's leave, will not be back. Among the newsmen, many who had been there<br />\non Thursday slept in their cars to avoid traffic. Some who had left their off-base lodgings at 2:30 would have missed seeing lift-off from the press sites, had it occurred on time.<br />\nThey would know better for their return Sunday.<br />\nSunday morning,T minus 1:30:40 and counting: Young and Crippen are not getting oxygen into<br />\ntheir suits. The problem is fonnd to be a inis-sealed quick release .attachment on the oxygen lines.<br />\nThe problem is fixed, the countdown continues.<br />\nT minus 9 minutes: A built-in hold period, and everything was go at this point on Friday, until it<br />\nwas found that the computers were not communicating. There had been an apparent problem in the number<br />\nthree fuel cell, too much hydrogen, but it was later disclosed that that was quite temporary and actually was a part of<br />\nthe normal functioning.<br />\nT minus 8 minutes 59 seconds and counting: An enormous cheer and much applause at the press site as the<br />\ncountdown resumes. The press are at least as enthusiastic as the million or so others who have come to witness the rebirth of man's<br />\nquest for the stars and for truth. Pubic i and press, are all here for the same reasons. The advantage of being the press is that we have the<br />\nbest seats. Why are we here; Public, press, we want to be here, we asked for the assignment, many, perhaps most of us have been here<br />\nbefore, too many years ago. The fact that there are men up there makes a difference. We know what it's like to be here, we wish we could<br />\nexplain what it's like but words, even pictures are inadequate. I want to leave the ground myself before! die.<br />\nT minus 7 minutes? You can feel the tension and anticipation in the air. There is going to be a launch. A camera and sound crew from Walt Disney<br />\nand another \u2022 one from IMAX, the people who made\"To Fly'', for the Smithsonian Aerospace Museum, are here recording this launch on 35mm and IMAX film<br />\nrespectively. The Disney crew has a digital recorder and microphones flat down to 0 cycles per second only 1200 feet from ground zero. Will they survive the<br />\nanticipated 152 decibel sound pressure level at that site? Three miles away at the press site, the anticipated sound level is 138 dB.<br />\nT minus 2 minutes and counting? Another cheer erupts. As each minute turns over on the countdown clock, the cheers have become louder and more<br />\nenthusiastic.<br />\nAbout 1 second before 7, ignition, a cheer and a roar of shutters clicking. A couple seconds later, a rushing sound. Too early for engine blast, maybe it's<br />\nthe thousands of gallons of water being sprayed into the pad as part of the noise suppression system for the launch.<br />\nLift off. The flame is bigger than I, a veteran of four Saturn V launches, had expected.Then the roar of the engines comes at about the<br />\ntime the shuttle clears the launch tower. And it keeps getting louder. Maybe your ears have been more vigorousl<br />\nassaulted at rock concerts but the sound here is concentrated around 16 hertz, slightly<br />\nbelow the lower limit of human hearing. It's incredibly loud, but it<br />\ndoesn't sound as loud as we might expect because our<br />\nears can't here that frequency. I remember taking<br />\nsome photos before and after it.

Her husband handed her a red and black<br />\nhotdog that glistened in the sun and was still feisty<br />\nenough, away from the grill, to crackle and spit. She<br />\ntook the hotdog out of its covering, put it on a paper<br />\nplate, and watched it slide in its black, grease drippings<br />\nas she walked to the bridge table. On it was a plastic jar<br />\nfilled to the top with brown mustard and next to it a jar<br />\nwith relish. She put her plate down and stood in front<br />\nof the jars. The ladles were sinking into the mustard and<br />\nrelish mountains and she stirred them in a circle. She<br />\nretrieved her plate and poured enough mustard and<br />\nrelish on her one dog for three. After she had sufficiently suffocated it, she raised it to her mouth and bit into<br />\nit. Mustard and relish exploded in her mouth and she<br />\ndropped her plate. She lunged at the jars, clutched the<br />\nladles, flung them away, and poured the relish container<br />\nover head. She then loosened her shorts and made<br />\nroom for the landslide of mustard. By the time her \u2022<br />\nhusband had noticed her, she had almost stripped and a<br />\nmound of relish was sitting on top of her head like an<br />\nemerald crown. As she shot away, her crown fell apart<br />\nand the mustard streaming down her thighs, streaked her<br />\nlegs. She ran across a field and her husband watched her<br />\nuntil she looked like a speck falling off the edge of the<br />\nworld. She reached a road which she tried to cross, but<br />\ncollapsed during the attempt. The woman baked in the<br />\nsun until it was ready to set and when she woke,her left<br />\nside was burning and swelled from the pain. She looked<br />\nup the road and saw a brown truck cutting through the<br />\nripples of heat. When it reached her she saw its dangling<br />\nfender and scraped sides. Two girls jumped out of the<br />\ntruck and ran to the body in the middle of their path.<br />\n\"You think she's alive?\" asked a skinny girl with<br />\ncharcoal red braids.<br />\n\"I think so, her back's goin' up and down,\" her<br />\ntwin sister said.<br />\n\"She aint got no clothes on. She looks like she's<br />\nbeen in a swamp or somethin'.\"<br />\nOne of the twins kicked the woman's thighs and<br />\nshe commanded enough of her muscles to look up at<br />\nthem.<br />\n\"She aint sayin' nothin'. Hey you got a name?\"<br />\nThe woman tried to brush the relish out of her<br />\nhair, but the sun had baked it into her scalp. She<br />\nsupported her weight on the palms of her hands.<br />\n\"Whatta we do with her?\"<br />\n\"I dunno,\" the twin with the braids shrugged.<br />\n\"Maybe we should clean her up. Hey you wanna<br />\nget cleaned up?\"<br />\nThe woman collapsed again and hit her head<br />\nagainst the pavement. The right side of her forehead<br />\nswelled into a red and rocky bump. Suddenly, the<br />\nwoman began to twitch as if she had been jolted by a<br />\njagged thunderbolt.<br />\n\"Let's get her in the truck,\" the twin with the<br />\nbraids said.<br />\nEach took an arm and dragged the woman into<br />\nthe truck--their local paper's refurbished delivery truck<br />\nand they threw her in like a sack of flour. Night fell out<br />\nof the sky and the twins drove off with their find. The<br />\nroad sent its bumps through .the woman's body and she<br />\nknew she was in motion. The twins chattered in the<br />\nfront and the woman could only sort out a disconnected<br />\nword or phrase from the bulk of their conversation.<br />\nThey drove until the first set of stars broke through the<br />\nsky's black film.<br />\n\"We're here, naked lady,\" a twin called to her.<br />\nHere, was a patch of land that stood next to a<br />\nriver bank. They parked the heisted delivery truck and<br />\nunloaded their passenger much the same way the rightful<br />\ndriver of the truck unloaded his newspapers. The<br />\nwoman tried to deduce her location unsuccessfully.<br />\nWhy would these strange girls take to river? she thought,<br />\nas she sat on a pile of wet leaves and watched the twins<br />\ncollect branches.<br />\n\"We gotta enough for a bonfire,\" the twin with<br />\nthe braids said.<br />\n\"Let's bring 'em to the beach,\" the other said.<br />\n\"You run ahead, Sis.\"<br />\nThey're going to roast me like a hotdog, the<br />\nwoman thought.<br />\n\"Come on, naked lady. We're goin' to the beach<br />\nand roast us some marshmallows 'till they turn mushy<br />\ninside and brown on the outside,\" the twin said, content<br />\nwith her observation.\"And here, I found this coat in the<br />\ntruck. Put it on.\"<br />\nThe twin handed her a blue smock with a logo<br />\nover the right breast, faded beyond identification. She<br />\nput it on and felt a rip underneath her arm.<br />\n\"This way.\"<br /><br />\neyJudi&amp; ,Watic/rt<br />\nThe woman followed and saw flames from the smiling like a snake flecking its tongue.<br />\ndistance.

A little bit later in life,<br />\nnone of the three sisters could even have told you that<br />\nthey was ever visited. They just sort of felt a little<br />\nempty. Like somethin had hit ern and they didn't have a<br />\nchance to see quite what it was.<br />\nThey father, though; he got changed a whole lot.<br />\nRuined his life. Never understood his little darlins once,<br />\nafter that. Could drive any man to drink to watch his<br />\nthree little girls seem n things and talkin when there<br />\nweren't nobody there and searchin, all the time, searchin.<br />\nThey daddy'd always been a Bible-ciuotin man<br />\nand when he got all drunked up he'd get to comparin his<br />\nlife to what he knew it could be. He came home one<br />\nnight hatin himself so much he beat up his little girls.<br />\nCame just short of killin em. Made em all swear never to<br />\ngive up they bodies to any man. Wanted his line to die<br />\noff straight out.<br />\nMost girls would never have stuck to any kind of<br />\npromise like that, but these girls was a little different.<br />\nThey'd been right enlightened by that early-on encounter with the spirit. When it never came back they filled<br />\nthey need for the spirit with they daddy. Started to<br />\nbelievin in that man more than a Egyptian follows his<br />\nPharaoh.<br />\nMeanwhile the girls growed up like piglets in a<br />\npigyard: all alike, all fat, and all happy. They daddy<br />\nkept on drinkin and, since nobody remembers nothin<br />\nwhen they drinkin all the time, he forgot bout what he'd<br /><br />\nmade his girls promise.<br />\nBut they never did, cause they daddy had beat<br />\nem hard.

The mens was expectin a whole lot more in they<br />\nmarriages than they actually ree-ceived.<br />\nCourse they all got dee-vorced.Then the daddy of the girls started to drinkin<br />\nharder'n ever. Came up with the devil's belly. You'd<br />\nthink he'd wanted it, he drank so hard. And he passed<br />\naway.<br />\nThe girls was all moanin and groanin for several<br />\nweeks til they spotted themselves a poor fellow named<br />\nLuke in the market one day. Luke wasjust a hound dog<br />\nof an old man, but he had the misfortune to look<br />\nexactly like the daddy of the three girls.<br />\nThe girls didn't think Luke was just a car-bone<br />\ncopy of they daddy.

No fantasy is<br />\nas familiar to the English-speaking world as<br />\nthe cycle of Arthurian legends, but until<br />\nnow no film has fairly presented it.<br />\nCamelot lapsed into saccharine romanticism; Robert Bresson's Lancelot of the<br />\nLake was austere and bleak to the point<br />\nof dullness; and although George Lucas<br />\nborrowed much of the mythic strength in<br />\nStar Wars from the Arthurian stories, a<br />\nderivation is definitely not the original.<br />\nJohn Boorman's Excalihur, a loose but<br />\nfaithful adaptation of Sir Thomas<br />\nMalory's Le Morte D'Arthur, is a shining<br />\ntriumph--a film which captures the<br />\npowerful essence of the Arthurian tales.<br />\nThere are two major stumbling<br />\nblocks which staid in the way of filming<br />\nthe Arthur story: (1) presenting the<br />\nentire legend within the time limits of a<br />\nfeature-length film, and (2) telling a story<br />\nwith which the audience is already<br />\nintimately familiar and making it work.<br />\nBy juggling characters and events<br />\nBoorman compresses the Arthur legend<br />\ninto 140 minutes, but despite the literary<br />\nsleight-of-hand necessary to do this none<br />\nof the important themes of Malory's<br />\nstory are lost. Galahad's character is<br />\ndeleted, and instead Perceval succeeds in<br />\nfinding the Grail. The quest for the Grail<br />\nis in turn secularized into a search for<br />\nsocio-political salvation rather than<br />\nreligious redemption--a piece of dramatic<br />\nlicense which fits in better with the rest<br />\nof the narrative than Malory's sudden<br /><br />\ngear-change into religious propagandizing.<br />\nThe Grail, like Excalibur, becomes a<br />\nsymbol of political authority legitimized<br />\nby supernatural powers. Incest and<br />\nadultery are still see . as politically<br />\nundermining forces, but it is Morgan le<br />\nFay who seduces Arthur with her sorcery<br />\nand produces Mordred, rather than<br />\nMordred being the disastrous offspring of<br />\nArthur inadvertantly sleeping with his<br />\naunt Margawse. Lancelot and Guenevere<br />\nhave their adulterous fling, but they later<br />\ndo penance for their actions and do not<br />\ncause the destruction of the Round<br />\nTable. Lancelot is a sympathetic character wishing to be purged of his love for<br />\nGuenevere, and, realizing the destructive<br />\npotential of their romance, he deliberately stays away from the court. His role<br />\nas savior is retained in Excalihur, symbolized by a wound received from falling on<br />\nhis sword which parallels Christ's wound<br />\non the cross. Details are changed in<br /><br />\nBoorman's version of Malory, but the<br />\nunderlying importance of the events and<br />\ncharacters is not.<br />\nWhat is truly dazzling about<br />\nExcalihur is Boorman's graphic treatment<br />\nof the story, a strange blend of realism<br />\nand fantasy. The initial scenes--craggy,<br />\nbrooding castles overlooking a turbulent,<br />\nslate-grey sea; the dark figures of battling<br />\nknights silhouetted against the background of a burning town; a crowd of<br />\ngrimy peasants watching jousting knights<br />\nhurling each other into the mud--are<br />\ngritty and dingy enough to be from the<br />\nDark Ages, or what we would imagine the<br />\nDark Ages to have been like. Boorman's<br />\nrepresentation of this period is not<br />\nhistorically accurate, but instead it is<br />\nwhat our mind's eye visualizes it to have<br />\nbeen. Apart from this pseudo-realism is<br />\nthe element of the purely fantastic: the<br />\narmor of the Round Table knights gleams<br />\nand glistens like stainless steel; Camelot is<br />\na fortress of silver and gold built from a<br />\nblueprint of high fantasy; Merlin creates a<br />\nprismatic spray of spells conjured out of<br />\n'dreams. Realism is unnecessary for a<br />\nsuspension of disbelief here.

Friday night at the Painter's Mill<br />\nTheatre a less than half full auditorium<br />\nwas treated to musical XTC (pun intended). Sadly, the British New Wave<br />\ngroup couldn't sell out the hall, but the<br />\npeople to feel sorry for are those who<br />\ndidn't go. XTC had the joint jumpin' and<br />\nfor a great reason--live and on vinyl, it is<br />\namong the most talented groups in rock.<br />\nEverything was nearly perfect<br />\nwith XTC, beginning with group leader,<br />\nguitarist Andy Partridge. Partridge writes<br />\nand sings most of XTC's songs, but even<br />\nwhen not singing lead, he still is the<br />\ncenter of attention. He's not attractive,<br />\nand he doesn't move around extravagantly; he lust plays.<br />\nBassist Colin Moulding, writer and<br />\nof the group's two pseudosinger<br />\nlead<br />\nhits, \"Making Plans for Nigel\" and<br />\n\"Generals and Majors,\" is what Benjamin<br />\nOrr of the Cars tries to be: the second<br />\nman who can step out front and take<br />\nover. If Orr were half as good at it as<br />\nMoulding, the Cars would be tolerable in<br />\nconcert.<br />\nIt is important not to ignore the<br />\nTerry<br />\nof drummer<br />\ncontributions<br />\nChambers and lead guitarist Dave<br />\nGregory. On stage, Chambers appears to<br />\nbe the most eccentric of the eccentrics.<br />\nOften lit through the drum kit, he<br />\napppears all angles and madly moving<br />\nelbows, giving XTC a drive most bands<br />\nlack. Gregory doesn't get much solo<br />\nspace, but given a few bars, he can lay<br />\ndown a line that sounds_ almost non-<br /><br />\nguitarish. In concert he also fiddles with<br />\nkeyboards, his total work creating the<br />\nsounds that separate XTC from other<br />\nbands.<br />\nTechnically, things also went<br />\nThe sound, which never<br />\nsmoothly.<br />\nachieved the right mix between the treble<br />\nand bass during the two opening acts (a<br />\nredundant, tolerable Joan Jett and an<br />\nincomprehensible, interesting, but insignificant Jools Holland from Squeeze),<br />\nfinally reached the proper balance during<br />\nXTC. The light show reminded one of<br />\nAndy Warhol's Plastic Inevitable-numerous projections onto a large screen<br />\nbehind the drummer with varying sheets<br />\nof pastels, something directly out of a<br />\n960's psychedelic club.<br />\nXTC didn't play for long, centering its song selection on its last two<br />\nalbums, Drums and Wires and Black Sea.<br />\nOpening with a letter perfect \"Real by<br />\nReel,\" the band slipped right into \"Life<br />\nBegins at the Hop,\" a semi-parodic view<br />\nof the life and music of the Fifties.<br />\nThese two songs set the mood for the<br />\nnight--the group was here to play, but<br />\nmost of all to have fun, and by the end of<br />\nthe night everyone was having fun with<br />\nthem.<br />\n'A highlight for the boisterous<br />\ncrowd occurred when Partridge called the<br />\nhouse security off a man dancing on the<br />\nfront of the stage. Soon more than half<br />\nthe crowd scrambled onto the stage,<br />\nscreaming and jumping like a punked<br />\nmolecule. XTC seemed to eat it up, and<br />\nits performance the rest of the night was<br />\nfueled by the fans only feet away.<br />\nMusical highlights included the<br /><br />\nINIM1111111111111111=1111<br /><br />\nlooking for is a mythic truth, not a<br />\nhistorical one, and Boorman's delivery is<br />\nso striking that we are carried off into a<br />\nworld of legendary \"reality.\"<br />\nTechnically, Excalibur is a gem.<br />\nThe jousts and battle scenes are excellently choreographed and quite believable, and the armor and weapons, albeit fantastic in design, are realistic in the<br />\ncontext of what we expect them to be<br />\nlike.<br />\nThe special effects, including<br />\nMerlin's myriad of spells and the Lady of<br />\nthe Lake holding Excalibur aloft from the<br />\nface of a glass-smooth pond, are flawlessly crafted. The technical precision<br />\nmakes the fantasy complete. At no time<br />\ndoes it seem that these are merely actors<br />\ndressed in mock armor pretending to be<br />\nknights of the Round Table--these are the<br />\nembodiments of the mythic form of<br />\nArthur's knights, and the technical<br />\nexpertise of the film is necessary to make<br />\nthe fantasy \"believable.\"<br />\nThe synthesis of Boorman's direction and the actors' suitability to their<br />\nroles make the characters come alive.<br />\nNicol Williamson as Merlin is the most<br />\noutstanding figure in the film, a paradoxical combination of inhuman sorcery and<br />\nparanormal sagacity on one hand and<br />\ntragically human foolishness on the other.<br />\nMerlin's voice ranges from eager whispers<br />\nto furious shouting to excited giggling,<br />\nand even though he doddles a bit, an aura<br />\not power radiates from him. Nigel Terry<br />\ncompetently handles the transformation<br />\nof Arthur the boy to Arthur the king, and<br />\nhis presence as an actor makes him a<br />\nperfect choice for the role.

All the major characters<br />\nare as they should be.<br />\nExcalihur is the story of the passing of<br />\nages, from Uther to Arthur, from chaos<br />\nto order, from Wizardry to humanity.<br />\nMerlin tells Morgana,\"Our time is passing<br />\nand the time of man is coming\";and this<br />\nfeeling of inevitable passing hangs over<br />\nthe action.<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br /><br />\nXTC: ferry Chambers, David Gregory, Andy Partridge, Colin Moulding<br />\nperformance of all but two of the tunes sitting, and no one standing was standing<br />\nfrom their latest album Black Sea.

PAGE 15<br /><br />\nNicholson Grits His Teeth<br /><br />\nRafelson's Postman Rings True<br />\nBY DAN VITALE<br />\nIn filming his version of The<br />\nPostman Always Rings Twice, director<br />\nBob Rafelson has gone back to the original<br />\nsource: James M. Cain's hard-boiled<br />\nbanned-in-Boston novella, first published<br />\nin 1934. The 1946 film version of<br />\nPostman, because of the restrictions of<br />\nthe Hays Code, had to tone down the<br />\nbook's violently sexual content, thus<br />\nrobbing the story of essential plot elecharacter motivations.<br />\nments and<br />\nRafelson, in remaining as faithful to<br />\nCain's vision as possible, has rendered,<br />\nwith a perfectionist's eye for detail, a<br />\ntaut, stark drama highlighted by excellent<br />\nperformances from Jack Nicholson and<br />\nJessica Lange in the lead roles.<br />\nThe story, set during the Depression, is simple, almost skeletal: Frank<br />\nChambers (Nicholson), a drifter, stops off<br />\nat a roadside cafe run by a Greek immigrant, Nick Papadalcis (John Colicos),<br />\nand his beautiful American wife, Cora<br />\n(Lange). Enticed both by Nick's offer of<br />\na job and his wife's sultry charm,<br />\nChambers decides to stay on. He seduces<br />\nCora, who is unhappy and desirous<br />\nof change, and together they plan Nick's<br />\nmurder and live happily ever after, or at<br />\nleast until the fates intervene. Playwright<br />\nDavid Mamet (Sexual Perversity in<br />\nChicago) has supplied Rafelson with a<br />\nterse, brooding script which, while not<br />\ncompletely faithful to Cain's novel,<br />\nretains much of its flavor.<br />\nRafelson (whose previous films<br />\ninclude Five Easy Pieces and The King of<br />\nMarvin Gardens), together with cinematographer Sven Nykvist (of Ingmar<br />\nBergman fame), has infused each scene of<br />\nthe film with a gritty, film noir look,<br />\nshooting exteriors in gray light and<br />\ninteriors in half-darkness. The sets, cars,<br />\ncostumes, and other incidentals are<br />\n1930's-accurate but not ostentatious,<br />\ngiving the film a grimy, lived-in quality as<br />\nopposed to a back-lot gloss.<br />\nThe acting is first-rate. Nicholson<br />\nhere gives a subdued, understated per-<br /><br />\nformance as Chambers, limiting his<br />\ninfamous repertoire of leers, sneers, and<br />\nother assorted facial acrobatics to mere<br />\nteeth-gritting and blank staring. Jessica<br />\nLange destroys all doubts about her<br />\nacting ability harbored by anyone who<br />\nremembers her in Dino DiLaurentis'<br />\nKing Kong fiasco, displaying remarkable<br />\ncontrol and sensuality in the pivotal role<br />\nof Cora. Perhaps the best praise one can<br />\ngive her is that she more than holds her<br />\nown in the scenes with Nicholson, who<br />\nusually dominates the screen like a<br />\nsequoia in a window box. John Colicos is<br />\nsufficiently greasy as Nick, and the<br />\nsupporting players are consistently effective.<br />\nThere are a few problems with the<br /><br />\nBoorman Waves His Magic Wand<br />\ncont. from p. 13<br />\nA minor weakness of Excalihur is<br />\nthe soundtrack, which occasionally makes<br />\nitself felt at the wrong moment and in the<br />\nwrong form. When Lancelot first sees<br />\nGuenevere, Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\"<br />\ntheme wafts through the scene, but,<br />\nappropriate though it may be, it sounds<br />\nrather trite. At other times, though, the<br />\nmusic is more effective: during some of<br />\nthe battle scenes, the action is punctuated<br />\nby a manic chorus shouting out a crazed<br />\nLatin litany.<br />\nThe greatest compliment which<br />\ncan be paid to Excalihur, though, is that<br />\nBoorman has succeeded in transferring<br />\nthe soul of the Arthurian epic to the<br />\nscreen. In terms of acting, direction,<br />\nplot, graphics, and technical craftsmanship, Boorman's film is superb, and he.<br />\nshows that he made the film with a love<br />\nfor the subject. Excalihur as a whole<br />\nsucceeds in its quest: with a wave of his<br />\ndirectorial staff, John Boorman has<br />\ntransformed the legends of King Arthur<br />\nand the knights of the Round Table into<br />\n,filmic reality.<br /><br />\nYou'll be amazed at all<br />\nthe opportunities and<br />\nadvantages the Army<br />\noffers men and women<br />\nwith BSN degrees:<br />\n\u2022 Excellent starting salaries and benefits, including a liberal vacation policy.<br />\n\u2022 Real opportunity for advancement and professional<br />\ngrowth\u2014every Army Nurse is a commissioned officer.<br />\n\u2022 No basic training for nurses; just a basic orientation<br />\ncourse to familiarize you with the Army Medical<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nID The chance to travel; time to do the things you enjoy.<br />\n\u2022 Opportunity to qualify for specialized roles, teaching<br />\nor additional education.<br />\nSee if you qualify.<br />\nCall collect to<br /><br />\n301-677-4891<br /><br />\nThe Army Nurse Corps.<br />\nFor more information, write:<br />\nThe Army Nurse Corps.<br />\nNortheast Region, U.S. Army Recruiting<br />\nFort George G.
