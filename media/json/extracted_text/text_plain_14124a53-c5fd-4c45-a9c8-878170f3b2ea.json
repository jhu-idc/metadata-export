Some contributions, however, have already been received,<br />\nand many inquiries have been made<br />\nby students interested in the proposed movement. Plans for inaugurating an enthusiastic and general<br />\ncampaign immediately after the<br />\nholidays are already being made.<br />\nWhile it is unfortunate that the<br />\ninterest aroused in the question of<br />\nbandage-rolling and Belgian relief<br />\nshould be in a measure dissipated<br />\nby the intervention of the Christmas vacation, those who are chiefly<br />\ninterested in She work are by no<br />\nmeans discouraged at the outlook<br />\nfor a successful campaign. Surely<br />\nno better time could be found for<br />\nconsideration and action in regard<br />\nto the matter than the beginning of<br />\na new term, and this, too, the second term, when the shadow of Final Examinations has not yet darkened the horizon. If anything at<br />\nall can be accomplished at Hopkins<br />\nto further the splendid work that<br />\nis being done in this country to<br />\nalleviate the suffering prevalent<br />\nabroad, it can be best accomplished<br />\nin the few weeks immediately succeeding the holidays.<br />\nThere is one way, however, in<br />\nwhich some of the students at the<br />\nUniversity can be of material assistance at the present time. Mr.<br />\nOrlando Harrison, owner of a large<br />\nnursery at Berlin, Md., has contributed five hundred Christmas trees<br />\nto the Belgian Relief Fund, and<br />\nthese will be put on sale on December 14 in the place surrounding the<br />\nLyric Theatre. The proceeds from<br />\nthe sale will be devoted to the cause<br />\nof assisting the sufferers abroad.<br />\nThus a great many people in the<br />\ncity will be able to contribute to<br />\nthe fund without the slightest inconvenience of any kind.<br />\nIn the meantime, the committee<br />\nwhose names were given in the last<br />\nedition of THE NEWS-LETTER will<br />\nbe ready to receive contributions of<br />\nmoney or clothing, or to take the<br />\nnames of volunteers for the bandage-rolling work, which will begin<br />\ndirectly after Christmas.

There is, however,<br />\nanother course, perhaps, equally<br />\nimportant, which ought to be inaugurated. A course in Art, including painting, sculpture, and<br />\narchitecture, such as is offered in<br />\nmost universities, large and small,<br />\nthroughout the country, is needed<br />\nat Johns Hopkins University. It<br />\nis needed that the Hopkins graduate may be more highly cultured<br />\nand broader minded.<br />\nBrown, for instance, offers no<br />\nless than six undergraduate art<br />\ncourses. Smith, also about the size<br />\nof Hopkins, has a number, with five<br />\nart professors, while Harvard has<br />\nover ten courses in the Fine Arts<br />\nalone, all open to undergraduates.<br />\nMichigan, among the Western colleges, has five courses on the History of Architecture, and many<br />\nothers under the direction of the<br />\nDepartment of Engineering.<br />\nThere are few men who do not<br />\nsooner or later feel the need for a<br />\nknowledge of art. An acquaintance<br />\nwith those who are respectfully<br />\ncalled the \"Old \u2022 Masters\" is as<br />\nnecessary to the well-bred man as<br />\nis a knowledge of history, or, in<br />\nfact, literature. Even as drawing<br />\npreceded writing in the growth of<br />\nman, so today, the love of the beautiful is present in the most uneducated classes. It is not the lack<br />\nof an esthetic taste, but the fact<br />\nthat it is uncultivated, that permits<br />\nthe \"eye-sores\" of the modern city.<br />\nThe study of the Classics is fine, yet<br />\nthe study of a Greek temple will lay<br />\nbare the soul of the people as much<br />\nas a drama of Euripides.<br />\nBut how may such a course be<br />\nintroduced at Hopkins? There are<br />\ntwo methods. First and best, to<br />\nprocure a new man who could conduct the new department. Or second, to use the material which we<br />\nalready have. This latter method<br />\nwould be almost as efficient, since<br />\namong the faculty there are a number who are authorities on different<br />\nphases of the subject. The course<br />\nmight well be divided into five<br />\nparts, under as many professors.<br />\nThe Art and Architecture of the<br />\nOrient would come under the direction of the Oriental Seminary; that<br />\nof Greece and Rome under the<br />\nClassical Department; to the Historical and Romance Departments<br />\nwould fall the instruction in Gothic<br />\nand Renaissance Art. In this manner the course might be introduced,<br />\nand later, when proof had been<br />\nmade of the student interest, then<br />\na separate department could be<br />\nfounded.<br />\nG. F.

Perhaps the most important feature of this meeting was<br />\nthe election of men to fill several<br />\nvacancies of the various committees<br />\nand offices. Myron E. Bagley, '16,<br />\nwas elected first vice-president to<br />\nsucceed John C. Branham who has<br />\nwithdrawn from the -University.<br />\nPaul W. Sutton, r'17, was elected<br />\nas successor to Mr. Bagley's former office of second vice-president.<br />\nClaude I. Uhler, 'is, was appointed<br />\nchairman of the missionary committee. This vacancy was also<br />\ncaused by Mr. Branham's withdrawal from the University. The<br />\nfact that Mr. S. D. Swan and Mr.<br />\nE. L. Fox, who composed .the executive council of the Association,<br />\nhave not returned ,to the University this year necessitated the election of a new council. Mr. H. S.<br />\nWillis and Mr. J. E. L. Holmes,<br />\nwho are both graduate students,<br />\nwere elected to fill these positions.<br />\nBesides these elections, the present condition of the Association was<br />\ndiscussed from every angle. Particular emphasis was placed on<br />\nplans for increasing the present influence of the Association on the<br />\ngeneral student body; but realizing<br />\nthat this influence is, in turn, dependent on the interest of the students in the activities of the Association.<br />\n' One of the results of the meeting<br />\nwas the inauguration of a membership campaign. This campaign will<br />\nbe started sometime in January.<br />\nThe exact date will be announced<br />\n\u2022<br />\nlater.<br />\nA fairly good Audience, composed<br />\nmostly of freshmen, heard Dr. Finney's second and closing lecture on<br />\n\"Hygiene,\" which was delivered<br />\nlast Monday afternoon. It is not unusual to say that those who attended<br />\nthese lectures this year seemed<br />\nto appreciate keenly Dr. Finney's<br />\ninteresting and instructive talks on<br />\nsuch a vital subject.

Rose of Teachers'<br />\nCollege, New York, in the physics<br />\nlaboratory, on \"Domestic Science.\"<br />\nDr. Rose spoke on a phase of<br />\ndomestic science which is just now<br />\noccupying a very prominent position in the public mind, namely,<br />\nhow to derive' the best nutrition in<br />\nthe cheapest way possible.<br />\nDr. Rose explained that different<br />\ntypes of mind must be sustained by<br />\ndifferent kinds of food\u2014that the<br />\nbrain of a man who is engaged in<br />\npurely mental fields of' action can<br />\nbe best nourished by one proportion of protein, fat, and fuel material, while the brain of a working man, in the usual acceptance of<br />\nthat term, requires a diet of an entirely different sort. In her lecture,<br />\nDr. Rose considered chiefly the food<br />\nrequired by the average man of<br />\nthe latter class.<br />\nDifferent foods are valuable for<br />\ndifferent properties. Breakfast foods<br />\nand cereals contain a large proportion of carbohydrates; cheese has a<br />\ngreat preponderance of fat, bananas<br />\npossess much fuel value. A balance of these properties is essentially necessary in any well regulated<br />\ndiet,'and Dr. Rose furnished some<br />\nvery simple and practical suggestions which could be applied in obtaining this balance.<br />\nOn the score of economy, many<br />\na deep-rooted food-tradition was<br />\ngiven its death-blow. It was conclusively shown that food did not<br />\nhave to be expensive in order to<br />\nbe beneficial, but that, on the contrary, many of the cheapest products were also the most whole-<br />\n<br />\nWe've Reduced<br />\n<br />\nOne of the most startling facts<br />\nin the matter of economy in relation to food that was brought out<br />\nduring the lecture.,*as that it is<br />\nnot'necessary to nourish A consumptive on milk, as has been commonly supposed, but that the same<br />\nvaluable materials could be given<br />\nhim in a diet of bacon.<br />\nAlthough Dr. Rose dealt with<br />\nscientific matters, she presented her<br />\nsubject in terms which were quite<br />\nplain, even to the layman.

Some contributions, however, have already been received,<br />\nand many inquiries have been made<br />\nby students interested in the proposed movement.

Surely<br />\nno better time could be found for<br />\nconsideration and action in regard<br />\nto the matter than the beginning of<br />\na new term, and this, too, the second term, when the shadow of Final Examinations has not yet darkened the horizon.

In the boiler-room<br />\nthe floor has been laid, scales for<br />\nweighing the coal when running on<br />\ntests have been installed and the<br />\nsuperheater completed. The only<br />\nthing which is not finished here is<br />\nthe ash-hoist.<br />\nIn the pump-room the floor has<br />\nalso been laid and with the removal<br />\nof the workmen and the placing of<br />\npacking on the pipes it has assumed<br />\na neat appearance, something which<br />\nwould have seemed impossible a<br />\nmonth ago.<br />\nIn the room adjoining the pumproom the foundation for the Diessel<br />\nengine has been completed and the<br />\nbig Austrian power producer will<br />\nbe erected as soon as the masonry<br />\nacquires sufficient hardness.<br />\nThe time for the students to visit<br />\nthe power-house is short.

Then, too, under such conditions there would be<br />\nno time for rest after the strenuous<br />\nweek, for the work of the next<br />\nterm would begin immediately.<br />\nSurely it is infinitely better to<br />\nhave, as Hopkins students have at<br />\npresent, in the deepest gloom the<br />\npromise of an approaching morrow<br />\nand, after the pilgrimage through<br />\nthe heat of the desert, the certainty<br />\nof a sojourn in the Land of Promise.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that these somewhat elaborate figures may not have<br />\nfrightened away the timid freshman, as it is to him that this last<br />\nparagraph, filled with unwelcome<br />\nadvice, is particularly addressed.<br />\nNotices of examinations are always<br />\nPublished a week in advance of the<br />\nfateful trysting-hour, and this week<br />\nis commonly spent in solitude,<br />\nmarked by much meditation and<br />\nburning of the midnight oil.

Surely, then, in<br />\nthe midst of this general confusion a few words on the examination system will be neither untimely nor out of place.<br />\nFirst of all as to the object of<br />\nthe system. The examinations,<br />\nwhich come at the end of every<br />\nterm, are intended not only to give<br />\nthe instructor definite information<br />\nas to the knowledge of his subject<br />\npossessed by any particular student,<br />\nbut also to review and sum up for<br />\nthe latter the work done during the<br />\nterm. Monthly tests, it has been<br />\nfound, tend to obscure the continuity of the course and fill the minds<br />\nof students with scraps of disconnected information. The system in<br />\npractice at Hopkins, on the other<br />\nhand, makes clear the connection<br />\nbetween the different parts of a<br /><br />\nPresident Goodnow's Recent Lectures.<br /><br />\nPresident Goodnow spoke at<br />\nPrinceton on Thursday before the<br />\nInternational Polity Club on \"The<br />\nWork of the Y. M. C. A. at Pekin.\"<br />\nHe showed an intimate knowledge of this Y. M. C.

He<br />\nreturned to Baltimore Friday morning.<br />\n\u2022 On Friday evening, in McCoy<br />\nHall, the president had the pleasure<br />\nof introducing Dean'James E.

He gave a very instructive talk on \"Conditions in China,\"<br />\ndealing with the financial status of<br />\nthat fast-awakening country.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nA PLEA FOR A COURSE IN ART<br /><br />\nA plea for a course in Political<br />\nScience has already appeared in<br />\nthese columns. There is, however,<br />\nanother course, perhaps, equally<br />\nimportant, which ought to be inaugurated. A course in Art, including painting, sculpture, and<br />\narchitecture, such as is offered in<br />\nmost universities, large and small,<br />\nthroughout the country, is needed<br />\nat Johns Hopkins University. It<br />\nis needed that the Hopkins graduate may be more highly cultured<br />\nand broader minded.<br />\nBrown, for instance, offers no<br />\nless than six undergraduate art<br />\ncourses. Smith, also about the size<br />\nof Hopkins, has a number, with five<br />\nart professors, while Harvard has<br />\nover ten courses in the Fine Arts<br />\nalone, all open to undergraduates.<br />\nMichigan, among the Western colleges, has five courses on the History of Architecture, and many<br />\nothers under the direction of the<br />\nDepartment of Engineering.<br />\nThere are few men who do not<br />\nsooner or later feel the need for a<br />\nknowledge of art. An acquaintance<br />\nwith those who are respectfully<br />\ncalled the \"Old \u2022 Masters\" is as<br />\nnecessary to the well-bred man as<br />\nis a knowledge of history, or, in<br />\nfact, literature. Even as drawing<br />\npreceded writing in the growth of<br />\nman, so today, the love of the beautiful is present in the most uneducated classes. It is not the lack<br />\nof an esthetic taste, but the fact<br />\nthat it is uncultivated, that permits<br />\nthe \"eye-sores\" of the modern city.<br />\nThe study of the Classics is fine, yet<br />\nthe study of a Greek temple will lay<br />\nbare the soul of the people as much<br />\nas a drama of Euripides.<br />\nBut how may such a course be<br />\nintroduced at Hopkins? There are<br />\ntwo methods. First and best, to<br />\nprocure a new man who could conduct the new department. Or second, to use the material which we<br />\nalready have. This latter method<br />\nwould be almost as efficient, since<br />\namong the faculty there are a number who are authorities on different<br />\nphases of the subject. The course<br />\nmight well be divided into five<br />\nparts, under as many professors.<br />\nThe Art and Architecture of the<br />\nOrient would come under the direction of the Oriental Seminary; that<br />\nof Greece and Rome under the<br />\nClassical Department; to the Historical and Romance Departments<br />\nwould fall the instruction in Gothic<br />\nand Renaissance Art. In this manner the course might be introduced,<br />\nand later, when proof had been<br />\nmade of the student interest, then<br />\na separate department could be<br />\nfounded.<br />\nG. F.

Perhaps the most important feature of this meeting was<br />\nthe election of men to fill several<br />\nvacancies of the various committees<br />\nand offices. Myron E.

This vacancy was also<br />\ncaused by Mr. Branham's withdrawal from the University. The<br />\nfact that Mr. S. D. Swan and Mr.<br />\nE. L. Fox, who composed .the executive council of the Association,<br />\nhave not returned ,to the University this year necessitated the election of a new council. Mr. H. S.<br />\nWillis and Mr. J. E. L.

Rose of Teachers'<br />\nCollege, New York, in the physics<br />\nlaboratory, on \"Domestic Science.\"<br />\nDr. Rose spoke on a phase of<br />\ndomestic science which is just now<br />\noccupying a very prominent position in the public mind, namely,<br />\nhow to derive' the best nutrition in<br />\nthe cheapest way possible.<br />\nDr. Rose explained that different<br />\ntypes of mind must be sustained by<br />\ndifferent kinds of food\u2014that the<br />\nbrain of a man who is engaged in<br />\npurely mental fields of' action can<br />\nbe best nourished by one proportion of protein, fat, and fuel material, while the brain of a working man, in the usual acceptance of<br />\nthat term, requires a diet of an entirely different sort. In her lecture,<br />\nDr. Rose considered chiefly the food<br />\nrequired by the average man of<br />\nthe latter class.<br />\nDifferent foods are valuable for<br />\ndifferent properties. Breakfast foods<br />\nand cereals contain a large proportion of carbohydrates; cheese has a<br />\ngreat preponderance of fat, bananas<br />\npossess much fuel value. A balance of these properties is essentially necessary in any well regulated<br />\ndiet,'and Dr. Rose furnished some<br />\nvery simple and practical suggestions which could be applied in obtaining this balance.<br />\nOn the score of economy, many<br />\na deep-rooted food-tradition was<br />\ngiven its death-blow. It was conclusively shown that food did not<br />\nhave to be expensive in order to<br />\nbe beneficial, but that, on the contrary, many of the cheapest products were also the most whole-<br /><br />\nWe've Reduced<br /><br />\nOne of the most startling facts<br />\nin the matter of economy in relation to food that was brought out<br />\nduring the lecture.,*as that it is<br />\nnot'necessary to nourish A consumptive on milk, as has been commonly supposed, but that the same<br />\nvaluable materials could be given<br />\nhim in a diet of bacon.<br />\nAlthough Dr. Rose dealt with<br />\nscientific matters, she presented her<br />\nsubject in terms which were quite<br />\nplain, even to the layman.
