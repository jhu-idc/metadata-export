CARLIN PRESGE<br />\nWhat is the difference between the<br />\nsyndrome known as pseudonecrosis and<br />\nactual clinical death? Death refers to<br />\nthat climax of life during which one's<br />\nsoul meets its maker and the body<br />\nbecomes inert. Pseudonecrosis is<br />\nbasically a localized process, although in<br />\napproximately 370,000 of its victims the<br />\nentire body demonstrates its<br />\nsymptomatology.<br />\nPseudonecrosis can be recognized by its<br />\nsimilarity to an exaggerated psoriasis. Tissue<br />\nbecomes flaky, discolored and insensate.<br />\nSometimes entire limbs fall off, leading to<br />\nembarrassment and yin/yang imbalance.<br />\nPseudonecrotics may be plagued by \"phantom<br />\nitching\" \u2014 the feeling that parts of the body<br />\nwhich no longer exist need to be abused.<br />\nFinally, the most dangerous form of the<br />\n<br />\ndisease, which is also the most common, is<br />\nCentral Nervous System pseudonecrosis, which<br />\noriginates in the brain. Other than soft-tissue<br />\notorrhea, that is, gray matter flowing from the<br />\nears, there is no gross physiological sign of this<br />\nvariety. Its victims \u2014 some estimates of their<br />\nnumber run as high as 100,000 in this country<br />\n\u2014 are usually recognizable only by withdrawal,<br />\nflat affect, apathy, anomie, and their voting<br />\npatterns.<br />\nDangerous substance<br />\nF.U. writes: Why are young girls advised not<br />\nto smoke marijuana by some doctors?<br />\nREPLY: Because marijuana has been<br />\nmedically proven to increase the sex drive,<br />\nturning normally demure young women into<br />\nsex-hungry animals.

Sam Friegel,<br />\nWithalachuchee's offensive<br />\nsparkplug, picked up eight<br />\ntrubbles himself during the spree<br />\nover utility fringman John<br />\nBerning, who had come into the<br />\ngame to replace Hommitz. It was<br />\nat this point that Brumblebush<br />\nelected to go with his star-to-be.<br />\n\"I just sort of played an<br />\nunlikely hunch,\" the coach<br />\nconfessed. \"I don't know exactly<br />\nwhy, but it seemed to me that<br />\nFriegel was playing our zone to<br />\nthe weak side, forcing John to<br />\ncommit himself to the inside too<br />\nsoon. I figured that Doug might<br />\nbe able to force the play back to<br />\nour sklunkles, but hell, I didn't<br />\nknow he was gonna play offense<br />\nlike he did!\"<br />\nPringle's presence ignited the<br />\nJays almost immediately. He shut<br />\noff Friegel effectively by<br />\noverplaying trilp one-on-one,<br />\nthereby forcing Friegel to pass off<br />\nto gunkleman Fritz Haber.<br />\nBetter Than Most<br />\nPringle, however, didn't stop<br />\nthere, but decided to take charge<br />\nof the Hopkins offense. \"I'm a<br />\nbetter vertleman than most scouts<br />\ngive me credit for. All I really did<br />\nwas fire the pritz into an open<br />\ndork; it was no big deal, really.\"<br />\nPringle rattled of an incredible<br />\nseventeen trubbles over a<br />\nseven-minute span to pull Hopkins<br />\neven at 20-20 with three minutes<br />\ngone in the second oglesby. The<br />\nWithalachuchee defense then<br />\nbegan ganging up on Pringle,<br />\nstopping the Jays' new-found<br />\nscoring threat at the expense of<br />\nthe Wombat attack. Hopkins took<br />\na 27-25 edge into the locker-room<br />\nat hruptime.<br />\n<br />\nThe final zickle saw both teams<br />\nplay a cautious, deliberate brand<br />\nof espatoon, with the key play<br />\ncoming with seconds remaining on<br />\nthe clock. With the Wombats<br />\nnursing a 34-33 edge, florgas Jerry<br />\nQuackenton was awarded a<br />\npenalty vertle after the Jays'<br />\nKevin Yerglefish was called for<br />\nprutting in the swexel.

Doug Pringle, the game's surprise hero, here<br />\ngets a good splursh on Sam Friegel.<br />\n<br />\nWar Hero:<br />\nEspatoon Coach<br />\nCoach Alex Brumblebush, affectionately called 'Brumbully' or<br />\n'Brumble-Pie' by his players, was noted in his undergraduate days<br />\nat Hopkins for his exploits on the Espatoon team. His fame came<br />\nfrom a spectacular backhand zickle. \"I scored once or twice in<br />\npractice, but both times it hurt real bad right down here,\" he<br />\nmentioned, stretching out the 'here' to show how much it hurt<br />\nand pointing to the back of his thigh.\"But the coach never let me<br />\nplay in a match.\" The coach came to Hopkins to direct the<br />\nEspatoon team after the war: the big one, WW II. He has won the<br />\ncoveted Coach of the Year award nine times. That award goes<br />\nannually to the the coach of the team that has the most<br />\nAll-Americans or to the team that wins the National<br />\nChampionship. If one team fulfills both of those requirements,<br />\nthe award goes to no one. Brumblebush commented to this<br />\nreporter that the Espatoon program at Hopkins is for the sole<br />\nbenefit of the alumni. \"The alumni wants two things from the<br />\nHopkin's Espatoon team.

CARLIN PRESGE<br />\nWhat is the difference between the<br />\nsyndrome known as pseudonecrosis and<br />\nactual clinical death? Death refers to<br />\nthat climax of life during which one's<br />\nsoul meets its maker and the body<br />\nbecomes inert. Pseudonecrosis is<br />\nbasically a localized process, although in<br />\napproximately 370,000 of its victims the<br />\nentire body demonstrates its<br />\nsymptomatology.<br />\nPseudonecrosis can be recognized by its<br />\nsimilarity to an exaggerated psoriasis. Tissue<br />\nbecomes flaky, discolored and insensate.<br />\nSometimes entire limbs fall off, leading to<br />\nembarrassment and yin/yang imbalance.<br />\nPseudonecrotics may be plagued by \"phantom<br />\nitching\" \u2014 the feeling that parts of the body<br />\nwhich no longer exist need to be abused.<br />\nFinally, the most dangerous form of the<br /><br />\ndisease, which is also the most common, is<br />\nCentral Nervous System pseudonecrosis, which<br />\noriginates in the brain. Other than soft-tissue<br />\notorrhea, that is, gray matter flowing from the<br />\nears, there is no gross physiological sign of this<br />\nvariety. Its victims \u2014 some estimates of their<br />\nnumber run as high as 100,000 in this country<br />\n\u2014 are usually recognizable only by withdrawal,<br />\nflat affect, apathy, anomie, and their voting<br />\npatterns.<br />\nDangerous substance<br />\nF.U. writes: Why are young girls advised not<br />\nto smoke marijuana by some doctors?<br />\nREPLY: Because marijuana has been<br />\nmedically proven to increase the sex drive,<br />\nturning normally demure young women into<br />\nsex-hungry animals.

Sam Friegel,<br />\nWithalachuchee's offensive<br />\nsparkplug, picked up eight<br />\ntrubbles himself during the spree<br />\nover utility fringman John<br />\nBerning, who had come into the<br />\ngame to replace Hommitz. It was<br />\nat this point that Brumblebush<br />\nelected to go with his star-to-be.<br />\n\"I just sort of played an<br />\nunlikely hunch,\" the coach<br />\nconfessed. \"I don't know exactly<br />\nwhy, but it seemed to me that<br />\nFriegel was playing our zone to<br />\nthe weak side, forcing John to<br />\ncommit himself to the inside too<br />\nsoon. I figured that Doug might<br />\nbe able to force the play back to<br />\nour sklunkles, but hell, I didn't<br />\nknow he was gonna play offense<br />\nlike he did!\"<br />\nPringle's presence ignited the<br />\nJays almost immediately. He shut<br />\noff Friegel effectively by<br />\noverplaying trilp one-on-one,<br />\nthereby forcing Friegel to pass off<br />\nto gunkleman Fritz Haber.<br />\nBetter Than Most<br />\nPringle, however, didn't stop<br />\nthere, but decided to take charge<br />\nof the Hopkins offense. \"I'm a<br />\nbetter vertleman than most scouts<br />\ngive me credit for. All I really did<br />\nwas fire the pritz into an open<br />\ndork; it was no big deal, really.\"<br />\nPringle rattled of an incredible<br />\nseventeen trubbles over a<br />\nseven-minute span to pull Hopkins<br />\neven at 20-20 with three minutes<br />\ngone in the second oglesby. The<br />\nWithalachuchee defense then<br />\nbegan ganging up on Pringle,<br />\nstopping the Jays' new-found<br />\nscoring threat at the expense of<br />\nthe Wombat attack. Hopkins took<br />\na 27-25 edge into the locker-room<br />\nat hruptime.<br /><br />\nThe final zickle saw both teams<br />\nplay a cautious, deliberate brand<br />\nof espatoon, with the key play<br />\ncoming with seconds remaining on<br />\nthe clock. With the Wombats<br />\nnursing a 34-33 edge, florgas Jerry<br />\nQuackenton was awarded a<br />\npenalty vertle after the Jays'<br />\nKevin Yerglefish was called for<br />\nprutting in the swexel. A trubble<br />\nhere would have iced the game,<br />\nbut Quackenton's vertle bounced<br />\nhigh off the shin guard of<br />\ndorktender Fran Cullen, Pringle<br />\nrebounding. The junior sensation<br />\nthen florted 75 yards down the<br />\nweatherwax singlehanded before<br />\nwhipping in the tying trubble past<br />\nthe diving Wombat dorktender<br />\nPete Raddle as the gun sounded.<br />\nOvertime<br />\nThe first overtime oglesby<br />\nfeatured a one-man show by<br />\nPringle that almost won the<br />\ncontest there. The substitute<br />\nplotzer notched four trubbles<br />\nhimself to stake the Jays to a<br />\n38-34 edge. But the Wombats,<br />\nsparked by Friegel again, battled<br />\nback to knot the count on a pair<br />\nof magnificent backhand vertles<br /><br />\nby the Withalachuchee star.<br />\nThe Wombats took the faceoff<br />\nto open the sudden death oglesby<br />\nand immediately started slowing<br />\nup the action, lookong to take the<br />\none percentage vertle they needed<br />\nfor the title. Blue Jay hearts<br />\nfluttered when Adrioni hit Friegel<br />\ntwO yards away from the dork,<br />\nbut Hopkins tutelman Ray Loxen<br />\nblocked the attempted vertle with<br />\nhis trilt. Dorktender Cullen picked<br />\nup the loose pritz, and lobbed<br />\ndown-weatherwax pass to Pringle<br />\nall alone in the ulch zone. Pringle<br />\nbeat Raddle one-on-one with his<br />\ntrubble at 6:15 of the<br />\nsudden-death oglesby as the Jays<br />\nwent wild.<br />\nThe victory marked sweet<br />\nrevenge for the Jays over the<br />\nWombats, who had earlier<br />\ntrounced Hopkins, 48-24 in the<br />\nopening round of the<br />\ndouble-elimination tourney. The<br />\nJays had to squeak by host<br />\nOskosh, 65-63, and tough<br />\nGondwana State, 17-16, in a<br />\nrough defensive battle, to earn the<br />\nright to take on Withalachuchee<br />\nfor the title.<br /><br />\nLATEST SCORES<br /><br />\nLAST NIGHT<br />\nWestern City Sump-pumps 96,<br />\nHiway Hotdogs 82.<br /><br />\nMonster Mashed<br />\nBy GOOD OLE' ED<br />\nLast Wednesday evening, Steven Feinmark and John<br />\n\"Monster\" Marshall *engaged in a real contest on the snack<br />\nbar bowling machine, with Feinmark eventually winning,<br />\n4203-4117.<br />\nIn a post-game interview, the<br />\n250 pound Marshall stated to<br />\nnewsmen: \"I guess you could say<br />\nI'm rather pissed off, not so much<br />\nbecause I lost, but because that<br />\n\"bleep\" machine did me wrong. I<br />\nwas leading that SOB until the<br />\nvery end, when the<br />\n\"Bleep ... bleep\" broke down,<br />\nFeinmark several extra<br />\nand<br />\nattempts. He took advantage of<br />\nthese \"cheap\" gains to eventually<br />\nbeat me with a strike on his last<br />\nroll. I'm not going to let this go<br />\nby without a protest, however,<br />\nI'm going to take this case to the<br />\nonly person I know who can do<br />\nsomething about it: that's right,<br />\nBob \"the Boob\" Murcko. If<br />\nMurcko can't do it, nobody can.\"<br />\nWould Not Talk<br />\nFeinmark, on the other hand,<br />\nhad no comment for the press.<br />\nSimply put, Feinmark probably<br />\nfeels that since he paid for the<br />\ngame, he should be given the win.<br />\nUnfortunately, Steve, things don't<br />\nwork that easily.<br />\nIf Feinmark is given the win<br />\nover the prime challenger, namely<br />\nMarshall, this could result in a<br />\ncomplete cancellation of<br />\nVillanova's 1970 basketball<br />\nseason.

His fame came<br />\nfrom a spectacular backhand zickle. \"I scored once or twice in<br />\npractice, but both times it hurt real bad right down here,\" he<br />\nmentioned, stretching out the 'here' to show how much it hurt<br />\nand pointing to the back of his thigh.\"But the coach never let me<br />\nplay in a match.\" The coach came to Hopkins to direct the<br />\nEspatoon team after the war: the big one, WW II. He has won the<br />\ncoveted Coach of the Year award nine times. That award goes<br />\nannually to the the coach of the team that has the most<br />\nAll-Americans or to the team that wins the National<br />\nChampionship. If one team fulfills both of those requirements,<br />\nthe award goes to no one. Brumblebush commented to this<br />\nreporter that the Espatoon program at Hopkins is for the sole<br />\nbenefit of the alumni. \"The alumni wants two things from the<br />\nHopkin's Espatoon team. They want the boys to win, and they<br />\nwant them to act like good Americans. That means they had<br />\nbetter dress right and act like I did when I was in school. We<br />\ndon't want any long haired kids on our team. And we want all<br />\nour boys to put out.
