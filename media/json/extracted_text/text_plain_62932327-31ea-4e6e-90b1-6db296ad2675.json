The NEws-Ltrrm hopes<br />\nthat this delay is not due to a feeling of opposition to the movement. The Freshman<br />\nclass has brought the matter up,'but apparently has not given it the serious consideration which it deserves. We have had<br />\nenough superficial discussion. The time has<br />\ncome for action. As Dr. Griffin has recently<br />\nsaid, if we do not adopt any of the forms in<br />\nuse in other colleges, this is no reason why<br />\nwe should not have an Honor System. Almost any modification of the system will be<br />\nof benefit to the University, and an improvement upon the present lack of system. Elsewhere in this issue may be found the substance of an article, presenting a little different view of the matter than that which<br />\nwe defend. However, the sooner the Senior<br />\nclass takes the initiative in this matter the<br />\nbetter it will be for the University.<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\nHE annual smoker of the Washington<br />\nAlumnae Association of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, which was held<br />\nat the Hotel Arlington, Washington, on January 23, was pronounced by visitors one of<br />\nthe most enjoyable occasions of the kind ever<br />\n!_eld by a Hopkins alumnae body.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nThe significant feature of the gathering<br />\nwas the presence of former Hopkins students, who now hold some of the most important offices in the United States Government departments\u2014departments which Hopkins men have really made, e. g., the U. S.<br />\nWeather Bureau; U. S. Geological Survey,<br />\nThe<br />\nand the Department of Labor, etc.<br />\nCommissioner of Labor, a graduate of Hopkins, said in the course of his remarks at<br />\nthe smoker, that he had once asked President Roosevelt what particular reason had<br />\nled him to select a Hopkins man as Commissioner of Labor. The President replied that<br />\nthe fact that the present encumbent of the<br />\noffice was a Hopkins man was the direct reason, for while many of the important offices<br />\nin the government were filled by Hopkins<br />\ngraduates, there had never been a ease where<br />\na Hopkins man had fallen short.<br />\nPresident Remsen gave the principal address, and spoke glowingly of the work<br />\nwhich has been, and is being, accomplished<br />\nby the University; and also dwelt on the<br />\nplans for Homewood. But anyone looking<br />\nover the list of brilliant alumnae present at<br />\nthat smoker could not refrain from echoing<br />\nPresident Remsen's statement that as much<br />\ngood work can be accomplished at our present \"barracks\" as could well be hoped for<br />\nat any other site.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe plan of the Hopkins Club to move<br />\nfrom its present home on Park Avenue, to<br />\na new location is arousing considerable interest in University circles. The Club has<br />\nof recent years found its present quarters<br />\nso small that any expansion was practically<br />\nimpossible. The plan, therefore, has been<br />\nproposed of procuring the two houses on the<br />\nnortheast corner of Howard and Monument<br />\nStreets, and of rebuliding them so as to form<br />\none handsome club house. The many advantages which. would accrue from this removal<br />\nare almost obvious. In the first place, the<br />\nnew locatoin would be nearer to the University, and therefore more convenient. Besides, the improved attractions would draw<br />\nin many new members, and put the Club<br />\nmore on the basis of the other large clubs<br />\nof the city. Of course, there are still difficulties of a financial nature to be overcome,<br />\nbut in all probability the new quarters will<br />\nbe secured in the near future.<br />\nThe Barrett Prizes, given by the Hon. John<br />\nBarrett, American Minister to Colombia,<br />\nseem a new departure in this country. As<br />\na rule, the college man on this side does not<br />\ngo in for politics or foreign service as does<br />\nthe young Briton fresh from the Universities. Besides being a gentleman, the Briton<br />\nbecomes an authority on some public function, interest, or relation and jumps into<br />\nprominence with the same matter of course<br />\nthat he pursues in his sport. Hence when<br />\nan American gentleman in the Diplomatic<br />\nCorps realizes the fact that the college men<br />\nof his country are deficient in this regard\u2014<br />\nhe gives a prize to stimulate their interest.<br />\nTo this end the Hon. John Barrett has<br />\noffered three prizes for the best three papers<br />\non subjects to be selected from ten, which<br />\ndeal with South American problems and<br />\ntopics in political economy and history The<br />\ncompetition is open to any American student<br />\nnow in any college, and the prizes are $100,<br />\n$75, and $50.<br />\nThe judges of this competition are<br />\nNicholas Butler, the President of Columbia<br />\nUniversity; Albert Shaw, Editor of the \"Review of Reviews;\" and John Huston Finley,<br />\nPresident of the College of the City of New<br />\nYork.<br />\n<br />\n(From Baltimore \"Sun,\" Jan. 23, 1906.)<br />\n<br />\n\"Apropos of the recent movement started<br />\nby several Northern colleges to form an intercollegiate bowling league, a number of<br />\ngraduate students at the Johns Hopkins University who have ability in felling the pins<br />\nwill meet on Saturday afternoon at the Diamond alleys and formally organize a duckpin bowling team. It is very likely that<br />\nrecognition will be asked from the Athletiic<br />\nAssociation of the University, and arrangements have already been formulated looking<br />\nto matches with some of the Northern college teams.<br />\n\"If the new team is recognized by the<br />\nAthletiic Association, it is thought that efforts will be made to persuade the Association to give an honorary \"H\" to men on the<br />\nbowling team whose work especially deserves credit. To make this \"H\" different<br />\nfrom the regulation initial given to athletic<br />\nteams, the bowlers are willing to compromise on an \"H\" crossed by the figure of a<br />\nduckpin. Inducements will be offered to<br />\nundergraduates to come out for the team.\"<br />\nIt is with a great deal of pleasure that we<br />\nreprint from our esteemed contemporary,<br />\nthe \"Sun,\" a part of its account of a new<br />\nventure in university \"athletics.\" We admit that the announcement came somewhat<br />\nin the form of a surprise, and we apologize<br />\nto our readers for allowing the \"Sun\" such<br />\na \"scoop.\" We especially wish to be considered as endorsing that idea of a new<br />\n\"'H' crossed by the figure of a duckpin.\"<br />\nDoubtless a wonderfully pleasing effect<br />\ncould be secured.<br />\nHowever, we don't intend to be beaten out<br />\nat every turn. Has the \"Sun\" heard of our<br />\nnew tiddle-de-wink team? As it does not<br />\nseem to have given this matter due attention, the \"Sun\" will perhaps be glad to<br />\nhear a few words apropos this new sport<br />\nShortly after the Christmas holidays, the<br />\nAthletic Association received letters from<br />\nseveral of the most prominent Eastern colleges, asking whether the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity could boast of a tiddle-de-wink<br />\nteam, and stating that if such were the case,<br />\nthey would hike to enter into negotiations<br />\naiming to secure a series of indoor matches.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe Athletic Association replied in due<br />\ncourse of time, that on account of the fact<br />\nthat the sport was not generally in vogue<br />\nat the Hopkins, no action could be taken.<br />\nHowever, when the matter was called to the<br />\nattention of the undergraduates there was<br />\nsuch keen competition for the honor of representing this University on its tiddle-dewink team that all other branches of athletics were temporarily abandoned. A regular team has now been formed and daily<br />\npractices are held in the Fifth Regiment<br />\nArmory. An exhibition match has already<br />\nbeen given at Blaney's and several others<br />\nare under consideration. It is thought that<br />\nthe Athletic Association will recognize the<br />\n<br />\nCheer the bowling team on to victory.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nteam. The special form of insignia will be<br />\na large blue tiddle-de-wink furnishing an<br />\nexcellent background for a black \"H.\" This<br />\nwill prove equally effective either on the<br />\nthe regulation jersey, or on the full dress<br />\nshirt.<br />\nIt might be well to mention in connection<br />\nwith this that the poorest man on the team<br />\nhas already shot 23 tiddle-de-winks in the<br />\n1<br />\n2 inch line.<br />\ncup in succession from the 14/<br />\nThis fact augurs well for the success of the<br />\nteam and for the preservation of this fascinating sport. (Note. Other branches !of<br />\nHopkins athletics are also in a flourishing<br />\ncondition).<br />\n<br />\nRoot for the tiddle-de-wink team.<br />\n<br />\nCarrie Nation has telegraphed us, \"Do<br />\nPresident Roosevelt is reported to have<br />\nexpressed much satisfaction that tiddle-de- you bowl at the Diamond?\" To which we<br />\nminks was raging at Hopkins.

The chief reason he believes this to<br />\nhave been the case is that the distinguished<br />\ncharacteristic of Southern civilization several<br />\ncenturies ago was that only the highest class<br />\nof the population could afford to go to college, and that the sons of gentlemen were<br />\ntaught to despise deceit. Moreover, it was<br />\nan outcome and manifestation of the extreme<br />\nconservatism characteristic of that section<br />\nduring the period when communication with<br />\nother parts of the world was very limited.<br />\nThe honor system was cherished as a heritage<br />\nto be proud of, one that was inseparably<br />\nlinked with the traditions of a lost cause.<br />\nHowever, even in the South, the writer<br />\nbelieves that these traditions are not as carefully lived up to now as in the past, for the<br />\nspirit of inherited democracy has been gradually disappearing, and with it are vanishing<br />\nthe home ideals that were formerly carried<br />\nto college. Young men no longer go to college to receive the badge of respectability;<br />\nand culture for culture's sake is foreign to<br />\nthe majority of students.<br />\nBut the inevitable question asserts itself:<br />\nCan the student be expected to rise in the<br />\ncollege class room above the ordinary standards of honor in society I \"If the most conspicuous leaders in politics, the organizers<br />\nof great business corporations, the presidents<br />\nof railroads and insurance companies, grow<br />\nrich and prosperous by taking advantage of<br />\ntheir opportunities to appropriate unearned<br />\ndividends, to concentrate on the favored few<br />\nwhat belongs to the unprotected multitude,<br />\nis it remarkable that a student under temptation should profit by such lessons and make<br />\nthe best of an opportunity to win an unearned degree, or secure unearned credit for<br />\n<br />\nan examination by misrepresentation The<br />\nhonor system in college is merely an application of the standards of Washington and<br />\nJefferson and Lee in political life.\"<br />\nProfessor Stevens believes that for the introduction of the honor system into any institution of learning, or for its subsequent<br />\nefficiency, the first essential is the organization of a college court, composed of leading<br />\nrepresentatives from the most important<br />\nclasses or departments. The efficiency of<br />\nsuch a court depends upon the earnestness<br />\nand watchfulness of a small minority of the<br />\nstudent body who are public spirited enough<br />\nto endure temporary inconvenience, and perhaps to risk their personal popularity by reporting those who offend against the laws<br />\nadopted by the student body. Although<br />\nsuch a court should be organized in every<br />\ncollege and its vitality be tested by actual<br />\npractise, yet it should not indeed be a court<br />\nof last resort. Its rulings should be subject<br />\nto examination by an appellate court, consisting of the president and a committee of<br />\nthe faculty of the institution. The right of<br />\nappeal to this supreme court should never<br />\nbe yielded, but such appeal should not be<br />\ndemanded unless strong reasons for it can<br />\nbe established.<br />\nThe writer then summarizes the conditions<br />\nthat are favorable and those that are detrimental to the maintenance of the honor system.<br />\n1. The difficulty is least in small towns<br />\nand greatest in large cities.<br />\n2. The difficulty is least with the most advanced students, and greatest with freshmen.<br />\n3. The difficulty is least where there is<br />\nthe greatest freedom in the election of<br />\ncourses of study, and greatest where a fixed<br />\ncurriculum is maintained with a high standard of graduation<br />\n4. The difficulty is observed to be greater<br />\nin technical schools than in those where much<br />\nof the work is avowedly for culture.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nProfessor Stevens thinks that where the<br />\nhonor system now exists it should be carefully guarded, and that everything should be<br />\ndone to encourage self-government in college, but that it (the honor system) must<br />\nInevitably become extinct, at least as we understand the term to-day. However, its<br />\nsubstitute, an unwritten code of honor, will<br />\nfully take its place.<br />\nWhile in many points we do not entirely<br />\nagree with the conclusions reached by Professor Stevens, yet we present his ideas in<br />\nthat they are partly in accord with the views<br />\nof some of the students in this University<br />\nwho do not believe in the introduction of<br />\nthe honor system. Not only is it interesting<br />\nto look at the matter from another standpoint, but it is only just to those whose honest convictions on the subject differ from<br />\nour own.<br />\n<br />\nThe Musical Clubs.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs have undoubtedly been<br />\nimproved greatly by the thorough reorganization which took place recently. More men<br />\nhave come out to rehearsals and they have<br />\nentered into the work with much more enthusiasm. The Glee Club made such a favorable impression on its late trip to Washington that since that time another invitation<br />\nhas been extended by the alumni to come<br />\nover for their annual banquet.<br />\nAnother concert was given January 26, at<br />\nthe Boys' Club of South Baltimore. The impromptu stunt quartet consisting of Ruth,<br />\nMaynard, Reynolds and Bloomfield proved<br />\nto be the hit of the evening.<br />\nThe next big event will be the joint conceit with the University of Virginia, which<br />\nwill take place here very shortly. It is very<br />\nimportant that this concert be a success. At<br />\nany rate, we do not want Hopkins to be outdone by Virginia, and it is up to every undergraduate to come out and help make this<br />\nconcert a success. At the Baltimore concert<br />\nlast year only fifteen undergraduates turned<br />\nout, and of them nine were ushers It is to<br />\nbe hoped that no such deplorable lack of<br />\nSpirit will be shown this year<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nAround the University.<br />\nThe football management is astir, and is<br />\narranging dates for what is expected to be<br />\nthe best schedule ever played at Hopkins.<br />\nThe first is with Delaware College, to be<br />\nplayed in Baltimore October 13, and the<br />\nother at Annapolis with St. Johns, Nov. 24.<br />\nGames are pending with the Navy, University of North Carolina, and George Washington University.<br />\nGeorge Hinman Abel has been elected captain of the '08 football team for 1906.<br />\nThe last of the series of three Hopkins<br />\ndances will be given on February 23.<br />\nThe Freshman class pin has at last made<br />\nits appearance. It is very attractive, consisting of a quadrangular gold plate with<br />\nred enamel lettering. We must congratulate<br />\nthe committee on getting up such a creditable badge.<br />\nAn interesting series of public lectures has<br />\nrecently been announced. Among the speakers will be Professors Bright, Smith, Ames,<br />\nReid, Stratton, Wood and Hollander of this<br />\nUniversity.

Nearly all the local institutions, including the<br />\nWoman's College had delegates in regular<br />\nattendance, and fourteen out-of-town delegates represented St. John's College, Western Maryland College, Charlotte Hall School<br />\nand Jacob Tome Institute. There were six<br />\nsessions of the conference, including two public Meetings. Three of the speakers were<br />\ntraveling secretaries of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, viz:<br />\nMrs. Lawrence Thurston, of China and Turkey; Dr. Cyril H. IIaas, who goes to China<br />\nshortly as a medical missionary, and Mr.<br />\nWm. 13. Pettus, secretary-elect of the College Association work in China. One of the<br />\nstrongest addresses of the conference was<br />\nthat given Sunday morning by Mr. E.

Unquestionably, it was a<br />\nmost successful meet, probably the best in<br />\nthe history of Hopkins, and much credit is<br />\ndue to W. Conwell Smith, '06, manager, and<br />\nEdmund C. Lynch, '07, assistant manager,<br />\nfor the happy result of their labors. The<br />\nArmory was well filled, the events were run<br />\noff with no agonizing waits between them,<br />\nand finally, fast time was the order of the<br />\nevening. There was only one thing that in<br />\nany way marred the success, and that was<br />\nthe insufficient supply of programs. There<br />\nwere scarcely half enough to go round.<br />\nFrom a Hopkins point of view, it was unfortunate that Swarthmore should win the<br />\nmeet, in spite of the fact that she only entered three men. But those three men were<br />\nathletes. Baker, their miler, broke both the<br />\nindoor mile and half-mile records (South<br />\nAtlantic), and Maxwell won the shot put.<br />\nThe 100 yard dash was won by Hennie, their<br />\nthird man. Hopkins came second, with 12<br />\npoints-5 made by Hill, when he lowered the<br />\n100 yard world's hurdle record from 13A<br />\nto 11% seconds, 3 made by Knight, who came<br />\nsecond in the same race, 3 by Black in the<br />\nhigh jump, and 1 by Michael in the shot put.<br />\nBrenton and Stewart took fourth place in the<br />\nmile and half-mile events, each one running<br />\na game race.<br />\n<br />\nThe prettiest race of the meet was the<br />\nrelay between Johns Hopkins and the University of Virginia. This was the last and<br />\nbest event of the program, and the one for<br />\nwhich the audience had been waiting the<br />\nwhole evening. Gunts, who ran first for J.<br />\nH. U., had just recovered from sickness and<br />\nwas not in good condition. In spite of this,<br />\nhe ran a game race, holding his man nearly<br />\nall the way around, but weakeend perceptibly toward the finish. Perce, second man<br />\nfor Hopkins, ran a good race, gaining on his<br />\nman, while Hunter, following after, further<br />\nreduced Virginia's lead. Then came the<br />\nprettiest race of the evening. Padgett's<br />\nman had a lead on him of more than thirty<br />\nyards. This was cut down to ten, to five,<br />\nand almost to two. However, in the last few<br />\nstrides, the strain of the wonderful pace he<br />\nwas setting proved too much, and the Virginia man crossed the tape ahead. Nothing<br />\ndisparaging can be said of our relay team.<br />\nEvery man gave all he had and was dead at<br />\nthe finish.<br />\nThe team, moreover, will be<br />\noffered a chance to get its revenge at Charlottesville in the spring.<br />\nTough and Street set a fast pace in the<br />\nhandicap 440, and held that pace nearly all<br />\nthe way around, while MacSherry made a<br />\ndecided hit at the start of the 220.<br />\nAltogether the meet was a success, and<br />\nfortunately the financial results were as satisfactory as the spectacular.<br />\n<br />\n\f9<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nBaseball.<br />\n<br />\nSnapshots.<br />\n<br />\nThe first practice of the baseball team was<br />\nheld in the cage on Saturday, Feb. 3. The<br />\nnumber and quality of the men who appeared<br />\nwas most encouraging for the organization of<br />\na really good baseball nine Altogether, over<br />\ntwenty candidates were present, and there<br />\nis every reason to believe that with efficient<br />\nundergraduate support, the team will have<br />\na most successful career.<br />\n<br />\n11, my camera, Mr. Phillips; I had<br />\nalmost forgotten it!\"<br />\n\"Never mind the camera, Miss<br />\nGittings, I intend to develop some pictures<br />\nof my own to-night, and I might as well do<br />\nyours at the same time. No bother, I assure you, as both of our instruments are of<br />\nthe same size.\"<br />\nThe girl colored slightly. \"No,\" she replied, I think I had better take it along with<br />\nme. I may need it to-morrow morning.\"<br />\n\"Then I shall give you the camera and<br />\nkeep the roll of film.- You surely cannot object to that?\"<br />\n\"Yes,I can,\" returned the girl,\"and I do.<br />\nI insist that you give me both the camera and<br />\nthe film.\"<br />\nHer tone was positive and Phillips was<br />\nabout to accede to her request when an idea<br />\nseized him. For the fun of the thing he<br />\nwould give her his camera in the place of<br />\nher own\u2014they were both of the same size<br />\nand make\u2014and then when he developed her<br />\npictures, he could easily ascertain the cause<br />\nof her firmness. Although he feared the<br />\noutcome of his plan, yet the \"dare-devil\"<br />\nspirit having taken possession of him, he decided to make the exchange and await the<br />\nresult.<br />\nSo with this idea in his brain,<br />\nPhillips stepped into the house, and when he<br />\nreappeared he handed his camera to Miss<br />\nGittings with as innocent an air as he could<br />\nassume.<br />\n\"Don't forget to tell your sister how sorry<br />\nI was she had gone driving,\" said the girl,<br />\nturning to leave.<br />\n\"I won't. I wish I might take you home,<br />\nbut you know that someone must stay here<br />\nwith mother.\"<br />\nThe girl's reply was inaudible, but the<br />\nman continued to gaze long and admiringly<br />\nat the retreating form. \"Let me see,\" he<br />\nmused,\"I guess it will be too hot to develop<br />\npictures to-night; I think I shall call on Miss<br />\nGittings.\" And not only did he call this<br />\nnight, but for many nights after this, so that<br />\n<br />\nIt is needless to say that this year the<br />\nbaseball team should be supported better<br />\nthan it has been in former years. The team<br />\nreceived little, or no support from the undergraduates last year owing to the fact that<br />\nmost of the games were played out of town.<br />\nThis year, however, the conditions are reversed. The majority of games will be played in Baltimore, and all are scheduled with<br />\nhigh class teams. The undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate departments of the University supported the football team last fall as well as<br />\ncould be hoped, and there is no reason why<br />\nthey should not do the same for the baseball<br />\nteam.<br />\nIt is the duty of the members of the University to make the baseball team as great<br />\na success as was the football team, and the<br />\nbest way to do so is to try for the squad, or<br />\nif that is impossible, to come out in a body<br />\nand root for the team.<br />\n<br />\nJust as we go to press a letter from<br />\nSpaulding's: \"Entirely out of tiddle-dewinks. Will poker chips do?\" We refer<br />\nthis to the Athletic Association without comment.<br />\nTHE BESS I SOUGHT.<br />\nBesought I pretty Bess one day,<br />\nTo do just what I thought;<br />\n\"But why must I obey?\" said she,<br />\n\"Why, dear, you know Bess ought.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhe soon would have forgotten the camera<br />\nincident had not the \"apple\" of his eye (he<br />\nmight have thought \"peach,\" a more appropriate term), left for a few days to visit a<br />\ngirl friend. Her departure appeared to him<br />\nmore in the light of an event than an episode, as now it would be impossible for him<br />\nto give her a chance for the \"this is so sudden\" phrase, there not even being a telephone line connecting them. So at last the<br />\npictures came back to his mind. He certainly had nothing better to do than to develop<br />\nthem, and the following night he set to work.<br />\nAlthough he was very much interested to<br />\nsee the result of his labors, nevertheless he<br />\nthought it would be productive of better<br />\nfilms to develop them one by one As well<br />\nas might be seen in the glow of the red light,<br />\nthe first picture was of a man.<br />\nFor a second this disconcerted him, but it was only<br />\nmomentarily. \"Very likely her father,\" he<br />\nmused. The second picture was also of a<br />\nman of apparently the same proportions as<br />\nthe first. Phillips tried to persuade himself<br />\ninto all kinds of beliefs, but when the sixth<br />\nturned out as the five preceding had done,<br />\nhe gave it up in despair, and developed the<br />\nremaining six intact. Five of the last lot<br />\nbore the features of the inevitable one, but<br />\nthe twelfth was slightly different. Beside<br />\nand very close to the man was what appeared<br />\nto be a girl. The man's arm was\u2014but Phillips did not investigate further. He finished<br />\nthe films as quickly as possible and went to<br />\nbed.<br />\nBy the morning his anger had somewhat<br />\nabated, but nevertheless two facts remained<br />\nto disturb him. He had liked Miss Gittings,<br />\nand he had been grievously misled. Phillips<br />\nhad never for an instant doubted her sincerity, and although he wished to say, \"such<br />\nis life,\" and forget the incident, yet in his<br />\nheart he really cared for the girl. The only<br />\nthing now left for him to do was to write a<br />\nnote returning the photographs. So he sat<br />\ndown at his desk and produced the following epistle:<br />\nMy Dear Miss Gittings:\u2014<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, unknown to yourself,<br />\nI exchanged cameras with you. Last night<br />\n<br />\nI developed your films, only to find that the<br />\nincident which I had intended as a joke, had<br />\nits serious side. Therefore, I hasten to return the films to their rightful owner.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nJames K. Phillips.<br />\nP. S.\u2014What is the date<br />\nHe could not refrain from adding the last<br />\nline, although he knew that it was none of<br />\nhis affair. Then inclosing the pictures, he<br />\nsealed the letter, and mailed it with a sigh<br />\nof relief. He wondered whether she would<br />\nacknowledge his note, for he knew that the<br />\nchances were that she would be very much<br />\nput out. But Phillips had not long to wonder. In the very next mail, or, to be more<br />\nexplicii, five minutes after he had posted the<br />\npictures he received a letter in a blue envelope. He opened it and read:<br />\nMy Dear Mr Phillips:\u2014<br />\nI received my pictures from the photographers to-day, and from them have discovered that through some mistake you have<br />\ngiven me your camera in place of my own.<br />\nThe subject of your pictures is very pretty,<br />\nno doubt, but why did you not tell me about<br />\nher before. Hoping that you will forgive an<br />\nunsuspecting accomplice, and return her<br />\ncamera.<br />\nVery truly,<br />\nElizabeth T. Gittings.<br />\nP. S.\u2014Is it to be this Autumn?<br />\nA curious smile passed over Phillips' countenance. He had had no idea that his camera had contained any pictures. But, of<br />\ncourse, it must have, for she said so; moreover, she returned them. He laid the photographs in a line upon the table, and gazed<br />\nat them long and silently. Yes, the pictures<br />\nwere certainly of a girl, and that girl was<br />\npretty, and that girl he knew, but he had<br />\nnot the faintest idea of how they happened<br />\nto be in his camera. Of one thing he was<br />\ncertain, he had never taken them. Slowly<br />\nhe \u2022 reread her letter. Perhaps the fact that<br />\nwas most surprising was that Miss Gittings<br />\ndid not appear to be very angry with him.<br />\nThen, although a few minutes before, Phillips supposed that he had been the only person who was misled, she seemed to infer that<br />\n<br />\n\f11<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nshe had been. Then, too, Phillips had once<br />\nthought that Miss Gittings might have to<br />\nexplain, but now he found himself in the<br />\nsame position, and no explanation at hand.<br />\nOf course, he could not expect her to believe<br />\nthat he knew nothing about the pictures she<br />\nhad returned; he must be able to clear up the<br />\nwhole aair or let it stand as it was\u2014the first<br />\nof which seemed to be impossible for the<br />\npresent. All day long he tried to think out<br />\nsome solution to the mystery, but next morning found him as much at sea as he ever had<br />\nbeen. More so, in fact, for he had received<br />\nthe following note:<br />\nMy Dear Mr. Phillips:\u2014<br />\nI want to thank you so much for the pictures of my brother, which you have so kindly developed. I can imagine how angry you<br />\nmust have been when you discovered that<br />\nyou had given her pictures to me. To be<br />\nfrank, the reason why I did not wish you to<br />\ndevelop the photographs of my brother was<br />\nthat I was afraid that you could not do them<br />\nas well as a professional; however, I see that<br />\nI was mistaken. Expecting to return home<br />\nto-morrow.<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nElizabeth T. Gittings.<br />\nPhillips first stared at the letter in blank<br />\namazement and then began calling himself<br />\nnames. \"What a confounded ass I was,\"<br />\nsaid he, \"to have for one instant supposed<br />\nthat the man was a lover, for if he had been,<br />\nwho would have been privileged to take the<br />\nlast picture?\" But as Miss Gittings had<br />\nProved herself not guilty, Phillips felt that<br />\nnow he must expend all his energies in doing<br />\nlikewise. He would probably have had a<br />\nhard road to travel had not the postman next<br />\nmorning come to his rescue. This time the<br />\nletter was from his own brother who had<br />\ngone away a short while before:<br />\nDear Jim:<br />\nI borrowed your camera just before I left,<br />\nand with it took some pictures of our (10<br />\nfriend Bess. Please have them developed<br />\nand send them to me. In haste,<br />\nBob.<br />\nPhillips, smiling sat down and wrote a note<br />\nto her whose camera he had. Then sealing<br />\nit with an air of triumph, he sent it by a<br />\n<br />\nservant to the Gittings' home, so that it<br />\nmight be there when she arrived.<br />\n\"Though I regret to report,\" he mused,<br />\nunconsciously using the language of a war<br />\ndispatch, \"that though through insurmountable reasons .no engagement has yet taken<br />\nplace up to this time, yet all indications<br />\npoint to there being one some time this evening.\" \"By Jove,\" he said aloud, recalling<br />\nher postscript, \"'Is it to be this autumn?'<br />\nIt won't be my fault if it isn't.\"<br />\nMcGill University at Montreal will send<br />\nanother Rhodes scholar to Oxford next October.

The NEws-Ltrrm hopes<br />\nthat this delay is not due to a feeling of opposition to the movement. The Freshman<br />\nclass has brought the matter up,'but apparently has not given it the serious consideration which it deserves. We have had<br />\nenough superficial discussion. The time has<br />\ncome for action. As Dr. Griffin has recently<br />\nsaid, if we do not adopt any of the forms in<br />\nuse in other colleges, this is no reason why<br />\nwe should not have an Honor System. Almost any modification of the system will be<br />\nof benefit to the University, and an improvement upon the present lack of system. Elsewhere in this issue may be found the substance of an article, presenting a little different view of the matter than that which<br />\nwe defend. However, the sooner the Senior<br />\nclass takes the initiative in this matter the<br />\nbetter it will be for the University.<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\nHE annual smoker of the Washington<br />\nAlumnae Association of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, which was held<br />\nat the Hotel Arlington, Washington, on January 23, was pronounced by visitors one of<br />\nthe most enjoyable occasions of the kind ever<br />\n!_eld by a Hopkins alumnae body.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nThe significant feature of the gathering<br />\nwas the presence of former Hopkins students, who now hold some of the most important offices in the United States Government departments\u2014departments which Hopkins men have really made, e. g., the U. S.<br />\nWeather Bureau; U. S. Geological Survey,<br />\nThe<br />\nand the Department of Labor, etc.<br />\nCommissioner of Labor, a graduate of Hopkins, said in the course of his remarks at<br />\nthe smoker, that he had once asked President Roosevelt what particular reason had<br />\nled him to select a Hopkins man as Commissioner of Labor. The President replied that<br />\nthe fact that the present encumbent of the<br />\noffice was a Hopkins man was the direct reason, for while many of the important offices<br />\nin the government were filled by Hopkins<br />\ngraduates, there had never been a ease where<br />\na Hopkins man had fallen short.<br />\nPresident Remsen gave the principal address, and spoke glowingly of the work<br />\nwhich has been, and is being, accomplished<br />\nby the University; and also dwelt on the<br />\nplans for Homewood. But anyone looking<br />\nover the list of brilliant alumnae present at<br />\nthat smoker could not refrain from echoing<br />\nPresident Remsen's statement that as much<br />\ngood work can be accomplished at our present \"barracks\" as could well be hoped for<br />\nat any other site.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe plan of the Hopkins Club to move<br />\nfrom its present home on Park Avenue, to<br />\na new location is arousing considerable interest in University circles. The Club has<br />\nof recent years found its present quarters<br />\nso small that any expansion was practically<br />\nimpossible. The plan, therefore, has been<br />\nproposed of procuring the two houses on the<br />\nnortheast corner of Howard and Monument<br />\nStreets, and of rebuliding them so as to form<br />\none handsome club house. The many advantages which. would accrue from this removal<br />\nare almost obvious. In the first place, the<br />\nnew locatoin would be nearer to the University, and therefore more convenient. Besides, the improved attractions would draw<br />\nin many new members, and put the Club<br />\nmore on the basis of the other large clubs<br />\nof the city. Of course, there are still difficulties of a financial nature to be overcome,<br />\nbut in all probability the new quarters will<br />\nbe secured in the near future.<br />\nThe Barrett Prizes, given by the Hon. John<br />\nBarrett, American Minister to Colombia,<br />\nseem a new departure in this country. As<br />\na rule, the college man on this side does not<br />\ngo in for politics or foreign service as does<br />\nthe young Briton fresh from the Universities. Besides being a gentleman, the Briton<br />\nbecomes an authority on some public function, interest, or relation and jumps into<br />\nprominence with the same matter of course<br />\nthat he pursues in his sport. Hence when<br />\nan American gentleman in the Diplomatic<br />\nCorps realizes the fact that the college men<br />\nof his country are deficient in this regard\u2014<br />\nhe gives a prize to stimulate their interest.<br />\nTo this end the Hon. John Barrett has<br />\noffered three prizes for the best three papers<br />\non subjects to be selected from ten, which<br />\ndeal with South American problems and<br />\ntopics in political economy and history The<br />\ncompetition is open to any American student<br />\nnow in any college, and the prizes are $100,<br />\n$75, and $50.<br />\nThe judges of this competition are<br />\nNicholas Butler, the President of Columbia<br />\nUniversity; Albert Shaw, Editor of the \"Review of Reviews;\" and John Huston Finley,<br />\nPresident of the College of the City of New<br />\nYork.<br /><br />\n(From Baltimore \"Sun,\" Jan. 23, 1906.)<br /><br />\n\"Apropos of the recent movement started<br />\nby several Northern colleges to form an intercollegiate bowling league, a number of<br />\ngraduate students at the Johns Hopkins University who have ability in felling the pins<br />\nwill meet on Saturday afternoon at the Diamond alleys and formally organize a duckpin bowling team. It is very likely that<br />\nrecognition will be asked from the Athletiic<br />\nAssociation of the University, and arrangements have already been formulated looking<br />\nto matches with some of the Northern college teams.<br />\n\"If the new team is recognized by the<br />\nAthletiic Association, it is thought that efforts will be made to persuade the Association to give an honorary \"H\" to men on the<br />\nbowling team whose work especially deserves credit. To make this \"H\" different<br />\nfrom the regulation initial given to athletic<br />\nteams, the bowlers are willing to compromise on an \"H\" crossed by the figure of a<br />\nduckpin. Inducements will be offered to<br />\nundergraduates to come out for the team.\"<br />\nIt is with a great deal of pleasure that we<br />\nreprint from our esteemed contemporary,<br />\nthe \"Sun,\" a part of its account of a new<br />\nventure in university \"athletics.\" We admit that the announcement came somewhat<br />\nin the form of a surprise, and we apologize<br />\nto our readers for allowing the \"Sun\" such<br />\na \"scoop.\" We especially wish to be considered as endorsing that idea of a new<br />\n\"'H' crossed by the figure of a duckpin.\"<br />\nDoubtless a wonderfully pleasing effect<br />\ncould be secured.<br />\nHowever, we don't intend to be beaten out<br />\nat every turn. Has the \"Sun\" heard of our<br />\nnew tiddle-de-wink team? As it does not<br />\nseem to have given this matter due attention, the \"Sun\" will perhaps be glad to<br />\nhear a few words apropos this new sport<br />\nShortly after the Christmas holidays, the<br />\nAthletic Association received letters from<br />\nseveral of the most prominent Eastern colleges, asking whether the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity could boast of a tiddle-de-wink<br />\nteam, and stating that if such were the case,<br />\nthey would hike to enter into negotiations<br />\naiming to secure a series of indoor matches.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe Athletic Association replied in due<br />\ncourse of time, that on account of the fact<br />\nthat the sport was not generally in vogue<br />\nat the Hopkins, no action could be taken.<br />\nHowever, when the matter was called to the<br />\nattention of the undergraduates there was<br />\nsuch keen competition for the honor of representing this University on its tiddle-dewink team that all other branches of athletics were temporarily abandoned. A regular team has now been formed and daily<br />\npractices are held in the Fifth Regiment<br />\nArmory. An exhibition match has already<br />\nbeen given at Blaney's and several others<br />\nare under consideration. It is thought that<br />\nthe Athletic Association will recognize the<br /><br />\nCheer the bowling team on to victory.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nteam. The special form of insignia will be<br />\na large blue tiddle-de-wink furnishing an<br />\nexcellent background for a black \"H.\" This<br />\nwill prove equally effective either on the<br />\nthe regulation jersey, or on the full dress<br />\nshirt.<br />\nIt might be well to mention in connection<br />\nwith this that the poorest man on the team<br />\nhas already shot 23 tiddle-de-winks in the<br />\n1<br />\n2 inch line.<br />\ncup in succession from the 14/<br />\nThis fact augurs well for the success of the<br />\nteam and for the preservation of this fascinating sport. (Note. Other branches !of<br />\nHopkins athletics are also in a flourishing<br />\ncondition).<br /><br />\nRoot for the tiddle-de-wink team.<br /><br />\nCarrie Nation has telegraphed us, \"Do<br />\nPresident Roosevelt is reported to have<br />\nexpressed much satisfaction that tiddle-de- you bowl at the Diamond?\" To which we<br />\nminks was raging at Hopkins. The Presi- have replied, \"We don't know.

The chief reason he believes this to<br />\nhave been the case is that the distinguished<br />\ncharacteristic of Southern civilization several<br />\ncenturies ago was that only the highest class<br />\nof the population could afford to go to college, and that the sons of gentlemen were<br />\ntaught to despise deceit. Moreover, it was<br />\nan outcome and manifestation of the extreme<br />\nconservatism characteristic of that section<br />\nduring the period when communication with<br />\nother parts of the world was very limited.<br />\nThe honor system was cherished as a heritage<br />\nto be proud of, one that was inseparably<br />\nlinked with the traditions of a lost cause.<br />\nHowever, even in the South, the writer<br />\nbelieves that these traditions are not as carefully lived up to now as in the past, for the<br />\nspirit of inherited democracy has been gradually disappearing, and with it are vanishing<br />\nthe home ideals that were formerly carried<br />\nto college. Young men no longer go to college to receive the badge of respectability;<br />\nand culture for culture's sake is foreign to<br />\nthe majority of students.<br />\nBut the inevitable question asserts itself:<br />\nCan the student be expected to rise in the<br />\ncollege class room above the ordinary standards of honor in society I \"If the most conspicuous leaders in politics, the organizers<br />\nof great business corporations, the presidents<br />\nof railroads and insurance companies, grow<br />\nrich and prosperous by taking advantage of<br />\ntheir opportunities to appropriate unearned<br />\ndividends, to concentrate on the favored few<br />\nwhat belongs to the unprotected multitude,<br />\nis it remarkable that a student under temptation should profit by such lessons and make<br />\nthe best of an opportunity to win an unearned degree, or secure unearned credit for<br /><br />\nan examination by misrepresentation The<br />\nhonor system in college is merely an application of the standards of Washington and<br />\nJefferson and Lee in political life.\"<br />\nProfessor Stevens believes that for the introduction of the honor system into any institution of learning, or for its subsequent<br />\nefficiency, the first essential is the organization of a college court, composed of leading<br />\nrepresentatives from the most important<br />\nclasses or departments. The efficiency of<br />\nsuch a court depends upon the earnestness<br />\nand watchfulness of a small minority of the<br />\nstudent body who are public spirited enough<br />\nto endure temporary inconvenience, and perhaps to risk their personal popularity by reporting those who offend against the laws<br />\nadopted by the student body. Although<br />\nsuch a court should be organized in every<br />\ncollege and its vitality be tested by actual<br />\npractise, yet it should not indeed be a court<br />\nof last resort. Its rulings should be subject<br />\nto examination by an appellate court, consisting of the president and a committee of<br />\nthe faculty of the institution. The right of<br />\nappeal to this supreme court should never<br />\nbe yielded, but such appeal should not be<br />\ndemanded unless strong reasons for it can<br />\nbe established.<br />\nThe writer then summarizes the conditions<br />\nthat are favorable and those that are detrimental to the maintenance of the honor system.<br />\n1. The difficulty is least in small towns<br />\nand greatest in large cities.<br />\n2. The difficulty is least with the most advanced students, and greatest with freshmen.<br />\n3. The difficulty is least where there is<br />\nthe greatest freedom in the election of<br />\ncourses of study, and greatest where a fixed<br />\ncurriculum is maintained with a high standard of graduation<br />\n4. The difficulty is observed to be greater<br />\nin technical schools than in those where much<br />\nof the work is avowedly for culture.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nProfessor Stevens thinks that where the<br />\nhonor system now exists it should be carefully guarded, and that everything should be<br />\ndone to encourage self-government in college, but that it (the honor system) must<br />\nInevitably become extinct, at least as we understand the term to-day. However, its<br />\nsubstitute, an unwritten code of honor, will<br />\nfully take its place.<br />\nWhile in many points we do not entirely<br />\nagree with the conclusions reached by Professor Stevens, yet we present his ideas in<br />\nthat they are partly in accord with the views<br />\nof some of the students in this University<br />\nwho do not believe in the introduction of<br />\nthe honor system. Not only is it interesting<br />\nto look at the matter from another standpoint, but it is only just to those whose honest convictions on the subject differ from<br />\nour own.<br /><br />\nThe Musical Clubs.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs have undoubtedly been<br />\nimproved greatly by the thorough reorganization which took place recently.

News.<br /><br />\nNew Books.<br /><br />\nThe intercollegiate missionary conference<br />\nheld in Levering Hall on Jan. 20 and 21 was<br />\none of the most successful of the metropolitan conferences of the kind this year. Nearly all the local institutions, including the<br />\nWoman's College had delegates in regular<br />\nattendance, and fourteen out-of-town delegates represented St. John's College, Western Maryland College, Charlotte Hall School<br />\nand Jacob Tome Institute.

Unquestionably, it was a<br />\nmost successful meet, probably the best in<br />\nthe history of Hopkins, and much credit is<br />\ndue to W. Conwell Smith, '06, manager, and<br />\nEdmund C. Lynch, '07, assistant manager,<br />\nfor the happy result of their labors. The<br />\nArmory was well filled, the events were run<br />\noff with no agonizing waits between them,<br />\nand finally, fast time was the order of the<br />\nevening. There was only one thing that in<br />\nany way marred the success, and that was<br />\nthe insufficient supply of programs. There<br />\nwere scarcely half enough to go round.<br />\nFrom a Hopkins point of view, it was unfortunate that Swarthmore should win the<br />\nmeet, in spite of the fact that she only entered three men. But those three men were<br />\nathletes. Baker, their miler, broke both the<br />\nindoor mile and half-mile records (South<br />\nAtlantic), and Maxwell won the shot put.<br />\nThe 100 yard dash was won by Hennie, their<br />\nthird man. Hopkins came second, with 12<br />\npoints-5 made by Hill, when he lowered the<br />\n100 yard world's hurdle record from 13A<br />\nto 11% seconds, 3 made by Knight, who came<br />\nsecond in the same race, 3 by Black in the<br />\nhigh jump, and 1 by Michael in the shot put.<br />\nBrenton and Stewart took fourth place in the<br />\nmile and half-mile events, each one running<br />\na game race.<br /><br />\nThe prettiest race of the meet was the<br />\nrelay between Johns Hopkins and the University of Virginia. This was the last and<br />\nbest event of the program, and the one for<br />\nwhich the audience had been waiting the<br />\nwhole evening. Gunts, who ran first for J.<br />\nH. U., had just recovered from sickness and<br />\nwas not in good condition. In spite of this,<br />\nhe ran a game race, holding his man nearly<br />\nall the way around, but weakeend perceptibly toward the finish. Perce, second man<br />\nfor Hopkins, ran a good race, gaining on his<br />\nman, while Hunter, following after, further<br />\nreduced Virginia's lead. Then came the<br />\nprettiest race of the evening. Padgett's<br />\nman had a lead on him of more than thirty<br />\nyards. This was cut down to ten, to five,<br />\nand almost to two. However, in the last few<br />\nstrides, the strain of the wonderful pace he<br />\nwas setting proved too much, and the Virginia man crossed the tape ahead. Nothing<br />\ndisparaging can be said of our relay team.<br />\nEvery man gave all he had and was dead at<br />\nthe finish.<br />\nThe team, moreover, will be<br />\noffered a chance to get its revenge at Charlottesville in the spring.<br />\nTough and Street set a fast pace in the<br />\nhandicap 440, and held that pace nearly all<br />\nthe way around, while MacSherry made a<br />\ndecided hit at the start of the 220.<br />\nAltogether the meet was a success, and<br />\nfortunately the financial results were as satisfactory as the spectacular.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nBaseball.<br /><br />\nSnapshots.<br /><br />\nThe first practice of the baseball team was<br />\nheld in the cage on Saturday, Feb. 3. The<br />\nnumber and quality of the men who appeared<br />\nwas most encouraging for the organization of<br />\na really good baseball nine Altogether, over<br />\ntwenty candidates were present, and there<br />\nis every reason to believe that with efficient<br />\nundergraduate support, the team will have<br />\na most successful career.<br /><br />\n11, my camera, Mr. Phillips; I had<br />\nalmost forgotten it!\"<br />\n\"Never mind the camera, Miss<br />\nGittings, I intend to develop some pictures<br />\nof my own to-night, and I might as well do<br />\nyours at the same time. No bother, I assure you, as both of our instruments are of<br />\nthe same size.\"<br />\nThe girl colored slightly. \"No,\" she replied, I think I had better take it along with<br />\nme. I may need it to-morrow morning.\"<br />\n\"Then I shall give you the camera and<br />\nkeep the roll of film.- You surely cannot object to that?\"<br />\n\"Yes,I can,\" returned the girl,\"and I do.<br />\nI insist that you give me both the camera and<br />\nthe film.\"<br />\nHer tone was positive and Phillips was<br />\nabout to accede to her request when an idea<br />\nseized him. For the fun of the thing he<br />\nwould give her his camera in the place of<br />\nher own\u2014they were both of the same size<br />\nand make\u2014and then when he developed her<br />\npictures, he could easily ascertain the cause<br />\nof her firmness. Although he feared the<br />\noutcome of his plan, yet the \"dare-devil\"<br />\nspirit having taken possession of him, he decided to make the exchange and await the<br />\nresult.<br />\nSo with this idea in his brain,<br />\nPhillips stepped into the house, and when he<br />\nreappeared he handed his camera to Miss<br />\nGittings with as innocent an air as he could<br />\nassume.<br />\n\"Don't forget to tell your sister how sorry<br />\nI was she had gone driving,\" said the girl,<br />\nturning to leave.<br />\n\"I won't. I wish I might take you home,<br />\nbut you know that someone must stay here<br />\nwith mother.\"<br />\nThe girl's reply was inaudible, but the<br />\nman continued to gaze long and admiringly<br />\nat the retreating form. \"Let me see,\" he<br />\nmused,\"I guess it will be too hot to develop<br />\npictures to-night; I think I shall call on Miss<br />\nGittings.\" And not only did he call this<br />\nnight, but for many nights after this, so that<br /><br />\nIt is needless to say that this year the<br />\nbaseball team should be supported better<br />\nthan it has been in former years. The team<br />\nreceived little, or no support from the undergraduates last year owing to the fact that<br />\nmost of the games were played out of town.<br />\nThis year, however, the conditions are reversed. The majority of games will be played in Baltimore, and all are scheduled with<br />\nhigh class teams. The undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate departments of the University supported the football team last fall as well as<br />\ncould be hoped, and there is no reason why<br />\nthey should not do the same for the baseball<br />\nteam.<br />\nIt is the duty of the members of the University to make the baseball team as great<br />\na success as was the football team, and the<br />\nbest way to do so is to try for the squad, or<br />\nif that is impossible, to come out in a body<br />\nand root for the team.<br /><br />\nJust as we go to press a letter from<br />\nSpaulding's: \"Entirely out of tiddle-dewinks. Will poker chips do?\" We refer<br />\nthis to the Athletic Association without comment.<br />\nTHE BESS I SOUGHT.<br />\nBesought I pretty Bess one day,<br />\nTo do just what I thought;<br />\n\"But why must I obey?\" said she,<br />\n\"Why, dear, you know Bess ought.\"<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nhe soon would have forgotten the camera<br />\nincident had not the \"apple\" of his eye (he<br />\nmight have thought \"peach,\" a more appropriate term), left for a few days to visit a<br />\ngirl friend. Her departure appeared to him<br />\nmore in the light of an event than an episode, as now it would be impossible for him<br />\nto give her a chance for the \"this is so sudden\" phrase, there not even being a telephone line connecting them. So at last the<br />\npictures came back to his mind. He certainly had nothing better to do than to develop<br />\nthem, and the following night he set to work.<br />\nAlthough he was very much interested to<br />\nsee the result of his labors, nevertheless he<br />\nthought it would be productive of better<br />\nfilms to develop them one by one As well<br />\nas might be seen in the glow of the red light,<br />\nthe first picture was of a man.<br />\nFor a second this disconcerted him, but it was only<br />\nmomentarily. \"Very likely her father,\" he<br />\nmused. The second picture was also of a<br />\nman of apparently the same proportions as<br />\nthe first. Phillips tried to persuade himself<br />\ninto all kinds of beliefs, but when the sixth<br />\nturned out as the five preceding had done,<br />\nhe gave it up in despair, and developed the<br />\nremaining six intact. Five of the last lot<br />\nbore the features of the inevitable one, but<br />\nthe twelfth was slightly different. Beside<br />\nand very close to the man was what appeared<br />\nto be a girl. The man's arm was\u2014but Phillips did not investigate further. He finished<br />\nthe films as quickly as possible and went to<br />\nbed.<br />\nBy the morning his anger had somewhat<br />\nabated, but nevertheless two facts remained<br />\nto disturb him. He had liked Miss Gittings,<br />\nand he had been grievously misled. Phillips<br />\nhad never for an instant doubted her sincerity, and although he wished to say, \"such<br />\nis life,\" and forget the incident, yet in his<br />\nheart he really cared for the girl. The only<br />\nthing now left for him to do was to write a<br />\nnote returning the photographs. So he sat<br />\ndown at his desk and produced the following epistle:<br />\nMy Dear Miss Gittings:\u2014<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, unknown to yourself,<br />\nI exchanged cameras with you. Last night<br /><br />\nI developed your films, only to find that the<br />\nincident which I had intended as a joke, had<br />\nits serious side. Therefore, I hasten to return the films to their rightful owner.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nJames K. Phillips.<br />\nP. S.\u2014What is the date<br />\nHe could not refrain from adding the last<br />\nline, although he knew that it was none of<br />\nhis affair. Then inclosing the pictures, he<br />\nsealed the letter, and mailed it with a sigh<br />\nof relief. He wondered whether she would<br />\nacknowledge his note, for he knew that the<br />\nchances were that she would be very much<br />\nput out. But Phillips had not long to wonder. In the very next mail, or, to be more<br />\nexplicii, five minutes after he had posted the<br />\npictures he received a letter in a blue envelope. He opened it and read:<br />\nMy Dear Mr Phillips:\u2014<br />\nI received my pictures from the photographers to-day, and from them have discovered that through some mistake you have<br />\ngiven me your camera in place of my own.<br />\nThe subject of your pictures is very pretty,<br />\nno doubt, but why did you not tell me about<br />\nher before. Hoping that you will forgive an<br />\nunsuspecting accomplice, and return her<br />\ncamera.<br />\nVery truly,<br />\nElizabeth T. Gittings.<br />\nP. S.\u2014Is it to be this Autumn?<br />\nA curious smile passed over Phillips' countenance. He had had no idea that his camera had contained any pictures. But, of<br />\ncourse, it must have, for she said so; moreover, she returned them. He laid the photographs in a line upon the table, and gazed<br />\nat them long and silently. Yes, the pictures<br />\nwere certainly of a girl, and that girl was<br />\npretty, and that girl he knew, but he had<br />\nnot the faintest idea of how they happened<br />\nto be in his camera. Of one thing he was<br />\ncertain, he had never taken them. Slowly<br />\nhe \u2022 reread her letter. Perhaps the fact that<br />\nwas most surprising was that Miss Gittings<br />\ndid not appear to be very angry with him.<br />\nThen, although a few minutes before, Phillips supposed that he had been the only person who was misled, she seemed to infer that<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nshe had been. Then, too, Phillips had once<br />\nthought that Miss Gittings might have to<br />\nexplain, but now he found himself in the<br />\nsame position, and no explanation at hand.<br />\nOf course, he could not expect her to believe<br />\nthat he knew nothing about the pictures she<br />\nhad returned; he must be able to clear up the<br />\nwhole aair or let it stand as it was\u2014the first<br />\nof which seemed to be impossible for the<br />\npresent. All day long he tried to think out<br />\nsome solution to the mystery, but next morning found him as much at sea as he ever had<br />\nbeen. More so, in fact, for he had received<br />\nthe following note:<br />\nMy Dear Mr. Phillips:\u2014<br />\nI want to thank you so much for the pictures of my brother, which you have so kindly developed. I can imagine how angry you<br />\nmust have been when you discovered that<br />\nyou had given her pictures to me. To be<br />\nfrank, the reason why I did not wish you to<br />\ndevelop the photographs of my brother was<br />\nthat I was afraid that you could not do them<br />\nas well as a professional; however, I see that<br />\nI was mistaken. Expecting to return home<br />\nto-morrow.<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nElizabeth T. Gittings.<br />\nPhillips first stared at the letter in blank<br />\namazement and then began calling himself<br />\nnames. \"What a confounded ass I was,\"<br />\nsaid he, \"to have for one instant supposed<br />\nthat the man was a lover, for if he had been,<br />\nwho would have been privileged to take the<br />\nlast picture?\" But as Miss Gittings had<br />\nProved herself not guilty, Phillips felt that<br />\nnow he must expend all his energies in doing<br />\nlikewise. He would probably have had a<br />\nhard road to travel had not the postman next<br />\nmorning come to his rescue. This time the<br />\nletter was from his own brother who had<br />\ngone away a short while before:<br />\nDear Jim:<br />\nI borrowed your camera just before I left,<br />\nand with it took some pictures of our (10<br />\nfriend Bess. Please have them developed<br />\nand send them to me. In haste,<br />\nBob.<br />\nPhillips, smiling sat down and wrote a note<br />\nto her whose camera he had. Then sealing<br />\nit with an air of triumph, he sent it by a<br /><br />\nservant to the Gittings' home, so that it<br />\nmight be there when she arrived.<br />\n\"Though I regret to report,\" he mused,<br />\nunconsciously using the language of a war<br />\ndispatch, \"that though through insurmountable reasons .no engagement has yet taken<br />\nplace up to this time, yet all indications<br />\npoint to there being one some time this evening.\" \"By Jove,\" he said aloud, recalling<br />\nher postscript, \"'Is it to be this autumn?'<br />\nIt won't be my fault if it isn't.\"<br />\nMcGill University at Montreal will send<br />\nanother Rhodes scholar to Oxford next October.
