In addition, 200 arts<br />\nand crafts presentations will be<br />\non review. These exhibits will be<br />\njudged prior to the fair so that<br />\nthe better exhibits will be given<br />\nthe better display locations.<br />\nOff-campus organizations such as<br />\nMaryPIRG, the Indo-China Peace<br />\nCampaign, and the National<br />\nOrganization for Reform of<br />\nMarijuana Laws will also be<br />\npresenting exhibits at the Spring<br />\nFair.<br />\nOther \"3400\" events include a<br />\nroving presentation of \"The<br />\nWizard of Oz\", a kite-flying<br />\ncontest sponsored by the Union<br />\nGoverning Board, a square dance,<br />\nand a variety of concerts.<br />\nTo accommodate the large<br />\nnumber of families expected to<br />\nattend the Fair will sponsor a<br />\nKiddies' Theater, puppet show,<br />\npony and bumper car rides, and<br />\nthe Emmett Kelly Jr. Circus.<br />\nFour information booths will<br />\nbe equipped with television sets<br />\nmanned by members of the<br />\nEngineering Club that will<br />\ncontinuously flash schedules of<br />\nevents and emergency notices.

Riina contain some favorable<br />\nnews for the Homewood undergraduate. For the fist time in<br />\na long while, it appears that there is a group of applicants to<br />\nHopkins that is not made up primarily of pre-med or natural<br />\nscience students. At an institution that has seemingly always<br />\nshown a bias in one of those directions, any trend towards<br />\ndiversification is to be encouraged.<br />\nTrue, the mean SAT scores of the 200 best qualified<br />\ncandidates for admission showed only 5.5 point and 8 point<br />\nincreases in verbal and math respectively, but for Hopkins the<br />\nscores of 685 and 721 are high enough to be encouraging.<br />\nWhat the admissions office must do now is to attempt to<br />\ndiversify the interests and raise the average board scores of all<br />\nthe applicants they accept, not just the top 200.<br />\nAlthough Riina's office has certainly done an acceptable<br />\njob in the selection of the \"200 club\" as it will undoubtedly<br />\ncome to be known, the more crucial work still remains to be<br />\ndone. Since, as Riina admits, his office cannot hope to enroll<br />\nmore than 40 percent of these students. the make-up of next<br />\nyear's freshman class will really be determined by the group<br />\nof applicants accepted for admission on the normal schedule<br />\nof the admissions department. Those decisions due to be<br />\nmailed early next month are far more important than the<br />\ntotal yield from the 200 club.<br />\nWhat the admissions office must do now is make a<br />\ncoordinated effort to admit a highly qualified class that is<br />\nequally representative of all academic interests.

He greeted me<br />\ncordially, invited me to look<br />\narouud the office, and then went<br />\nback to whatever he was doing.<br />\nNew recruits are still left much on<br />\ntheir own, much as I was and most<br />\nof those who join the staff are<br />\nthose who have sought us out, not<br />\nthe other way around.<br />\nAfter a few minutes of looking<br />\naround the office, whose walls<br />\nwere then and are still covered<br />\nwith old posters newspaper front<br />\npages, graffiti and obscenities, I<br />\nleft the building with a feeling that<br />\n<br />\nwould by negotiating a flight of<br />\nstairs.)<br />\nI might add that the same prank<br />\n<br />\n1I<br />\n<br />\nCli.,.13.1CAII<br />\n<br />\nV/<br />\n<br />\nmatter.<br />\nYour first article included a<br />\nquotation from Colonel Serena,<br />\nstating that the student inside the<br />\nroom was asleep. After talking to<br />\nthe participants, I found this not<br />\nto be the case. Only if this were so<br />\nwould I consider Dean<br />\nFitzpatrick's term \"terrorizing\"<br />\naccurate. Before any flames<br />\nappeared, the students in the<br />\nhallway made certain the occupant<br />\nwas wide awake. They meant no<br />\nharm to him.<br />\nThe article also included<br />\nSerena's opinion that the student's<br />\nlife was in jeopardy; this I would<br />\nconsider an overstatement on<br />\nSerena's part. Since the student<br />\n(fully clothed) left his room<br />\nthrough the door, without<br />\nattempting to put out the fire, it<br />\nseems to me that neither the fire<br />\nnor the smoke it produced could<br />\nhave been of a lethal nature. (I<br />\nsupport this by the fact that the<br />\nother three students returned to<br />\nthe room and extinguished the<br />\nflames w ; th a glass of water. The<br />\noccupant, in my opinion, faced no<br />\nmore danger from the fire than he<br />\n<br />\ny, I<br />\n<br />\nVIA<br />\nM.J.<br />\n<br />\nWC.1<br />\n<br />\nI1.5,1<br />\n<br />\nC.1111<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n%kik%<br />\nI/WC-C<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nand leaving no reason to report the<br />\n<br />\nincident. In the recent case, I<br />\nwould blame the occupant as much<br />\nas the three other students for any<br />\ndamage done, since instead of<br />\ngrabbing his towels he ran down<br />\ntwoflights to announce to the.<br />\nhousemaster that his room was on<br />\nfire.<br />\nYour second article might have<br />\nincluded some explanation why<br />\nthe remaining three students chose<br />\nnot to appeal to the Dean. Dottie<br />\nLebo informed one of the students<br />\nthat several professors had phoned<br />\nin negative responses concerning<br />\nthem, after reading the<br />\nNews-Letter's one-sided coverage;<br />\nupon hearing this the three<br />\nstudents became discouraged and<br />\nthen decided not to appeal.<br />\nIn conclusion, it is my opinion<br />\nthat poor, improper coverage in<br />\nthe News-Letter has contributed<br />\ngreatly to the ' overly negative<br />\nattitude toward four now-infamous<br />\nHopkins students who executed a<br />\ncommon college prank.<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Tiller<br />\n<br />\nMore Cooperation<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\na widely accepted fact here that if<br />\nIn the spirit of greater anybody is going to be studying cooperation between Johns it's bound to be at Hopkins.

The temper of an<br />\ninstitution has chang,ed, and what<br />\nseemed to be all-important only a<br />\nfew years ago seems almost futile<br />\nnow.

That<br />\npattern, perceived after far less<br />\nthan 42 months shows Hopkins to<br />\nbe an institution like any other,<br />\nreplete with incompetence,<br />\ndishonesty, stupidity, and yes, in<br />\naddition, a noble desire to provide<br />\nthe best mankind can offer in his<br />\nquest for truth and knowledge.<br />\nThe paper has reflected<br />\nHopkins' development since 1970.<br />\nThen, each edition was filled with<br />\naccounts of Lincoln Gordon's<br />\nlatest administrative fiasco, stories<br />\nof student agitations, and concern<br />\nover the quality of Homewood's<br />\nacademic offerings. Then, everyone<br />\nknew that Lincoln Gordon had no<br />\nmOre business being president of a<br />\nuniversity than Evil Knievel does,<br />\nand the content of the News-Letter<br />\nreflected that perception. On the<br />\nacademic side, there was the story,<br />\ncomplete with dramatic front-page<br />\npicture, of the evening two<br />\nsymbolic coffins representing the<br />\nabolished Russian program and<br />\nEducation department were<br />\ninterred in the upper quad.<br />\nOver the years, the stories began<br />\nto reflect the inward turn taken by<br />\nmost students. The paper began to<br />\ncover the quality of food on<br />\n<br />\nadministrative expenditures. His<br />\noffice was in Homewood House<br />\nthen, in the former bedroom of<br />\nArchbishop Carroll, and it was<br />\nfilled with mementoes of his days<br />\nin the Kennedy administration,<br />\nfirst as ambassador to Brazil and<br />\nthen as Assistant Secretary of State<br />\nfor Inter-American Affairs.<br />\nThe memorabilia included an<br />\nautographed picture of Gordon<br />\nsitting with President Kennedy, the<br />\nflag that had flown over the<br />\nembassy in Rio and his official<br />\ncommissions of office, signed by<br />\neither Kennedy or Lyndon<br />\nJohnson, in whose administration<br />\nGordon also served. The story I<br />\nhad was something about federal<br />\nbudget cuts and it involved some<br />\ncomplicated figures, which Gordon<br />\nread from a neatly typed sheet of<br />\npaper in front of him.- At the close<br />\nof the interview, I asked him for<br />\nthe paper and he gave it to me. I<br />\nwent back to the office, wrote the<br />\nstory and forgot about the<br />\ndocument.<br />\nThe next morning I got a<br />\n\\<br />\n-1<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nfi<br />\n<br />\nany activity that s:TIT7; 4.result in<br />\n<br />\n\\ CV...0<br />\n<br />\nVANCIINe<br />\n<br />\nthat' \u2022<br />\n<br />\nrigu re s<br />\n<br />\nwri7;<br />\n<br />\non<br />\n<br />\nCaW.<br />\n<br />\ntb,<br />\n<br />\nit,'' a<br />\n<br />\nit.cova<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\n',re/ 1,11c1Iwos<br />\n<br />\nbreathless<br />\n<br />\nThe temper of an institution has<br />\n<br />\nchanged, and what seemed<br />\n<br />\nall-important only a few years ago<br />\n<br />\nseems almost futile now.<br />\nimmediate and tangible personal<br />\nreward.

The meeting could not<br />\nhave led to much success, for<br />\nwithin a month, Gordon was out<br />\n<br />\nof a job.<br />\nMuch later, the News-Letter<br />\nhappened onto the tale of another<br />\nadministrative incompetent, this<br />\none in the admissions office,<br />\npresided over by John R.

I<br />\nfound out later that Suskind was<br />\nso embarrassed by the paper's<br />\ncoverage of the pass-fail issue that<br />\nhe told another administrator I<br />\nwould be refused a<br />\nrecommendation for any<br />\npost-graduate fellowship for which<br />\nI applied.

Some of the<br />\nnotable flops include our attempt<br />\nto get -- and make sense of \u2014 the<br />\nUniversity's budget.

The position of Young<br />\nTrustee offers the Board<br />\nof Trustees : the opportunity<br />\nto stay abreast of current<br />\nstudent's thinking with regards<br />\nto all Hopkins affairs. From the<br />\npast four yours I've tried to<br />\nwork with students, faculty,<br />\nand adminisstration to do what<br />\nI thought was right in helping<br />\nto improve education and life in<br />\ngeneral at Johns Hopkins. I<br />\nhave a great respect for the<br />\nquality of education at Johns<br />\nHopkins but I quite realize that<br />\nthe University doesn't live up to<br />\nwhat might be a much greater<br />\npotential. And<br />\nguess in all<br />\nhonesty I feel my work for four<br />\nyears along with a very real<br />\ndesire -to help direct the<br />\nUniversity in the future towards<br />\nthings which I think, and which<br />\nI think my fellow students<br />\nthink are important, moves me<br />\nto run for the position of<br />\nYoung Trustee. In terms of<br />\nqualifications for the positions<br />\nthe typical thing to do is to set<br />\nup a nice list of things which<br />\none has done over the past four<br />\nyears and point to these as<br />\n<br />\nqualifications. In my freshman<br />\nyear, a desire to participate in<br />\nthe Hopkins community and<br />\nthe Baltimore city community<br />\nmotivated my participation in<br />\nvarious campus and non-campus<br />\nactivities. During Freshman<br />\nyear, as a member of the<br />\nDormitory Student Residents<br />\nCouncil I tried to work to<br />\nimprove life for freshmen in the<br />\nDormitories. In addition, I<br />\nbecame involved in the<br />\nChaplain's office. My service<br />\nwith the Chaplain's office really<br />\nheightened my awareness of the<br />\nPotential that Hopkins has, the<br />\nentire university community,<br />\nfor serving the city of<br />\nBaltimore. My campus activities<br />\ninclude such things as helping<br />\nto write the 1973-1974<br />\nUniversity Catalogue, serving on<br />\nthe Student Council's selections<br />\ncommittee during my<br />\nsophomore year. being an<br />\nundergraduate student rep to<br />\nthe Student Conduct Code<br />\nCommittee, coordinating and<br />\ndirecting the first TEVAL at<br />\nHopkins, which is still<br />\ncontinuing. I've been an<br />\nundergraduate representative to<br />\nthe Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate tudies. Last<br />\nsummer. I was a student rep to<br />\nthe joint Goucher Hopkins<br />\nCommittee on the future of the<br />\ntwo schools, I've been a<br />\nrepresentative to the student<br />\ncouncil and this year I'm<br />\npresident of the Senior Class.<br />\nLast and by no means least, and<br />\nperhaps the most important<br />\nthing to me, has been my role<br />\nas student assistant to the Dean,<br />\nor student ombudsman. I've<br />\nworked with both Deans,<br />\nchairmen of the departments,<br />\nwith members of the Board of<br />\nTrustees and with various other<br />\nfaculty members.<br />\nBene t ta Mansfield: I'm a<br />\nstudent and I'm an active<br />\nstudent. But I really don't feel<br />\nthat there's any special<br />\nqualification that makes you a<br />\ngood Young Trustee. I've been<br />\n<br />\nvery active both inside school<br />\nand off the campus. But having<br />\nspoken to the present young<br />\nTrustees, I Oink the<br />\nundergraduate body here knows<br />\nvery little about what the<br />\nposition encompasses. I don't<br />\nthink that serving on the<br />\nStudent Council or working on<br />\nstudent organizations<br />\nnecessarily qualifies one for<br />\nTrustee. When I went in front<br />\nof the Board of Trustees last<br />\nyear, on behalf of the Student<br />\nCouncil, I felt that they were<br />\nvery interested and receptive to<br />\nthe problems of Homewood. I<br />\nthink I could represent our<br />\nviews in that body. I'm running<br />\nbecause I sincerely want the<br />\njob, and I'm sincerely interested<br />\nin the future of the school. I<br />\nfeel that I could serve my<br />\nconstitutents,\u2022 and by my<br />\nconstituents I mean .the<br />\nundergraduates of Hopkins. I<br />\nthink there's an awful lot of<br />\nrepresentation on the Board for<br />\nthe Med school, and I think the<br />\nvieWs of the undergraduates<br />\nhave to be conveyed to the<br />\nBoard.<br />\nQuestion: What programs or<br />\nin which areas of University<br />\naffairs would you like to see the<br />\nBoard devote its attention to in<br />\nits upcoming sessions?<br />\nShep Hoffman: I believe the<br />\ntrustees have expressed a very<br />\nsincere interest in trying to<br />\nUnderstand the position,<br />\nopinions, and feelings of the<br />\nundergraduate at Johns<br />\nHopkins. This is certainly, in<br />\nlarge part, evidenced by the<br />\npresence of the four Young<br />\nTrustees on the Board of<br />\nTrustees In this regard, I would<br />\ngenerally like to see the Board<br />\ndevote more time to trying to<br />\nrealize to what, in fact, the<br />\nposition of an Undergraduate<br />\nstudent at Johns Hopkins is.<br />\nSpecifically, I Would direct<br />\nmyself to a few proposals.<br />\nTrends throughout the country,<br />\nnot just in University tuition,<br />\nbut in all finances, have shown<br />\n<br />\nus all that everything is only<br />\ngoing to cost more. At Hopkins<br />\ntuition is going up. It's going to<br />\ncontinue to go up. I feel very<br />\nstrongly that some alternative,<br />\nnew alternatives, must be<br />\nsought t pass on the increased<br />\ncosts of education to the<br />\nstudents, both undergraduate<br />\nand gi-aduate. I feel very<br />\nstrongly that we insure that no<br />\nstudent is turned away from<br />\nHopkins for financial reasons. I<br />\nbelieve, in addition, that it is<br />\ncertainly within the Board's<br />\ncharge to urge the office of<br />\nadmissions, to seek out a more<br />\ndiverse body for admission. The<br />\nquality and diversity of the<br />\nHopkins faculty is not in tune<br />\nwith the quality and diversity<br />\nof its students. Finally, it is<br />\nimportant, even vital, that we<br />\nraise funds to sustain the<br />\nUniversity. In addition to<br />\nstrengthening the University's<br />\nendowment, I would like to see<br />\nthe Board strengthen the<br />\nquality of education at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBenetta Mansfield: First of<br />\nall, I want to beg the question a<br />\nlittle. I can remember the<br />\ncandidates running and making<br />\na lot of promises. I don't<br />\nbelieve a candidate for Young<br />\nTrustee can make promises. I<br />\nthink that one person on a<br />\nboard of 50 Trustees has very<br />\nlittle power to get a program<br />\nacross or to get anything<br />\nthrough the Board. The biggest<br />\nfault I see in electing young<br />\ntrustees is that we elect them<br />\nand then we never hear from<br />\nthem again. I think that it's<br />\nreally important that a Young<br />\nTrustee write articles for the<br />\nNews-Letter, as to what's going<br />\non with the Board of Trustees,<br />\nto come back the day before<br />\nthe Trustee meeting and spend<br />\nthe entire day on campus<br />\ntalking to students and seeing<br />\nhow they feel, to keep in<br />\ncontact with student<br />\norganizations and seeing what<br />\nthey're doing. I see that as my<br />\n<br />\nmost important function on the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, to keep in<br />\ncontact with the<br />\nundergraduates. As to what I'd<br />\nlike to see the Board deal with,<br />\nI think the school has many<br />\nproblems. I would hope that<br />\nthe Board will deal with the<br />\nproblems that the library is<br />\nencountering, that is<br />\novercrowding, low finances, and<br />\na deficient collection. Also I<br />\nwould urge the Board to deal<br />\nwith the problem of housing,<br />\neither by building more dorms<br />\nor by buying up more housing<br />\n,in Homewood. The freshmen<br />\nand the \"upperclassmen are<br />\nfrantic each spring looking for<br />\nhousing in a tight housing<br />\nsituation. I think that the<br />\nadmissions policy of the school<br />\nneeds some revision. I,<br />\nunderstand that the school<br />\nnever intends to have an<br />\nequalization of men and<br />\nwomen. I think this, is very<br />\nwrong. I don't advocate a<br />\nquota, however I think that<br />\nadmissions standards should be<br />\nfair to everyone. I think it's<br />\nvery important to recruit and<br />\nincrease the applicant pool in<br />\nevery subject in the school. I<br />\nwant to stress again how<br />\nimportant I think it is for a<br />\nYoung Trustee to be<br />\nresponsible to keep the<br />\nundergraduates informed about<br />\nwhat's going on.

Director<br />\nof Admissions and Financial Aid.<br />\n\"Letters of acceptance were<br />\nmailed last week to 201 of the<br />\nmost highly qualified applicants<br />\nto Hopkins,\" said Riina.<br />\n\"Invitations are being extended<br />\nto these students to visit the<br />\ncampus April 10 or 11, attend<br />\nsome classes and meet and speak<br />\nto professors.\" he said.<br />\n\"This will also provide them<br />\nwith the opportunity to evaluate<br />\nthe university and its academic<br />\nlife, and to assess their future<br />\nplans,\" he added.<br />\n\"Of the 201 selected this year,<br />\n97 have indicated interest in the<br /><br />\nhumanities, social, behavioral and<br />\nengineering sciences; 89 have<br />\nnatural science preferences, and<br />\n15 are undecided,\" commented<br />\nRiina. \"Of this group, 63 have<br />\nindicated that they are<br />\npre-meds,\" he continued.<br />\nThis year's group has slightly<br />\nhigher mean verbal and math<br />\nSAT scores than last year's<br />\ngroup. The current group has a<br />\nmean verbal score of 685 and a<br />\nmean math score of 721, an<br />\nincrease of 5.5 points and 8<br />\npoints in verbal and in math<br />\nrespectively over the previous<br />\nyears. According to Riina, the<br />\nstudents from both years are<br />\nfairly comparable in most<br />\nacademic respects that are<br />\ndiscernible from typical<br />\nstandardized test results and<br />\nsecondary school records.<br />\nOf the 203 students<br /><br />\ncomprising last year's group, 134<br />\nvisited the campus.

The<br />\nFaculty Admissions Committee<br />\nand the Student Admissions<br />\nCouncil will sponsor their visit to<br />\nHopkins next month.<br />\nAccording to Riina, the<br />\npurpose of this program is to<br />\nattract the most highly qualified<br />\napplicants, make these applicants<br />\naware of their status, and<br />\nencourage them to attend<br />\nHopkins if they believe the<br />\nadvantages and opportunities<br />\noffered here would be in their<br />\nbest interests.<br />\n\"Considering last year's group<br />\nwhich contained 203 members<br />\n82 were -e,nerolled or about 40<br />\npercent.\" said Riina.<br />\n\"This 40 percent yield was<br />\nhigh and we were gratified by the<br /><br />\nLimited space causes book shifts<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nDue to severe space problems,<br />\nthe MSE Library has been forced<br />\nto move part of its collection to<br />\nthe Gilman Hall stacks where the<br />\nvolumes are presently suffering<br />\nconsiderable damage because of<br />\nthe lack of temperature and<br />\nhumidity control in Gilman,<br />\naccording to Head Librarian<br />\nDavid Stam.<br />\nStam revealed that the<br />\ntransferred volumes will suffer<br />\ngreat damage in the summer<br />\nwhen the humidity and heat will<br />\nrise drastically. \"Dr. Benton has<br />\ntold me that air conditioning<br />\nsystems will probably not be<br />\ninstalled in Gilman until next<br />\nfall,\" Stam explained.<br />\n\"The library itself is about<br />\nfull.

At an institution that has seemingly always<br />\nshown a bias in one of those directions, any trend towards<br />\ndiversification is to be encouraged.<br />\nTrue, the mean SAT scores of the 200 best qualified<br />\ncandidates for admission showed only 5.5 point and 8 point<br />\nincreases in verbal and math respectively, but for Hopkins the<br />\nscores of 685 and 721 are high enough to be encouraging.<br />\nWhat the admissions office must do now is to attempt to<br />\ndiversify the interests and raise the average board scores of all<br />\nthe applicants they accept, not just the top 200.<br />\nAlthough Riina's office has certainly done an acceptable<br />\njob in the selection of the \"200 club\" as it will undoubtedly<br />\ncome to be known, the more crucial work still remains to be<br />\ndone. Since, as Riina admits, his office cannot hope to enroll<br />\nmore than 40 percent of these students. the make-up of next<br />\nyear's freshman class will really be determined by the group<br />\nof applicants accepted for admission on the normal schedule<br />\nof the admissions department. Those decisions due to be<br />\nmailed early next month are far more important than the<br />\ntotal yield from the 200 club.<br />\nWhat the admissions office must do now is make a<br />\ncoordinated effort to admit a highly qualified class that is<br />\nequally representative of all academic interests. Anything else<br />\nwould be more of the same, something Hopkins can do<br />\nwithout.<br /><br />\nThe Bearer _<br /><br />\nEmployed By<br /><br />\na\u2022<br /><br />\n&amp;l.1.)/14...lisuc-<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nMy<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nA confession: I did what my old man told me<br />\nBy RICHARD WARING<br />\nIt could all be blamed on my old<br />\nman. I suppose, for in one of those<br />\nfather-son talks we had the<br />\nsummer before I came to Hopkins.<br />\nhe told me that I should \"really<br />\nconsider working for the campus<br />\nnewspaper.\"<br />\nSo I did.<br />\nOne sultry September evening in<br />\n1970, in humidity of the sort only<br />\nBaltimore can provide, I walked<br />\ndown to the Gatehouse to meet<br />\nMark Reutter, then editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter. He greeted me<br />\ncordially, invited me to look<br />\narouud the office, and then went<br />\nback to whatever he was doing.<br />\nNew recruits are still left much on<br />\ntheir own, much as I was and most<br />\nof those who join the staff are<br />\nthose who have sought us out, not<br />\nthe other way around.<br />\nAfter a few minutes of looking<br />\naround the office, whose walls<br />\nwere then and are still covered<br />\nwith old posters newspaper front<br />\npages, graffiti and obscenities, I<br />\nleft the building with a feeling that<br /><br />\nwould by negotiating a flight of<br />\nstairs.)<br />\nI might add that the same prank<br /><br />\n1I<br /><br />\nCli.,.13.1CAII<br /><br />\nV/<br /><br />\nmatter.<br />\nYour first article included a<br />\nquotation from Colonel Serena,<br />\nstating that the student inside the<br />\nroom was asleep. After talking to<br />\nthe participants, I found this not<br />\nto be the case. Only if this were so<br />\nwould I consider Dean<br />\nFitzpatrick's term \"terrorizing\"<br />\naccurate. Before any flames<br />\nappeared, the students in the<br />\nhallway made certain the occupant<br />\nwas wide awake. They meant no<br />\nharm to him.<br />\nThe article also included<br />\nSerena's opinion that the student's<br />\nlife was in jeopardy; this I would<br />\nconsider an overstatement on<br />\nSerena's part. Since the student<br />\n(fully clothed) left his room<br />\nthrough the door, without<br />\nattempting to put out the fire, it<br />\nseems to me that neither the fire<br />\nnor the smoke it produced could<br />\nhave been of a lethal nature. (I<br />\nsupport this by the fact that the<br />\nother three students returned to<br />\nthe room and extinguished the<br />\nflames w ; th a glass of water. The<br />\noccupant, in my opinion, faced no<br />\nmore danger from the fire than he<br /><br />\ny, I<br /><br />\nVIA<br />\nM.J.<br /><br />\nWC.1<br /><br />\nI1.5,1<br /><br />\nC.1111<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n%kik%<br />\nI/WC-C<br />\n.<br /><br />\nand leaving no reason to report the<br /><br />\nincident. In the recent case, I<br />\nwould blame the occupant as much<br />\nas the three other students for any<br />\ndamage done, since instead of<br />\ngrabbing his towels he ran down<br />\ntwoflights to announce to the.<br />\nhousemaster that his room was on<br />\nfire.<br />\nYour second article might have<br />\nincluded some explanation why<br />\nthe remaining three students chose<br />\nnot to appeal to the Dean. Dottie<br />\nLebo informed one of the students<br />\nthat several professors had phoned<br />\nin negative responses concerning<br />\nthem, after reading the<br />\nNews-Letter's one-sided coverage;<br />\nupon hearing this the three<br />\nstudents became discouraged and<br />\nthen decided not to appeal.<br />\nIn conclusion, it is my opinion<br />\nthat poor, improper coverage in<br />\nthe News-Letter has contributed<br />\ngreatly to the ' overly negative<br />\nattitude toward four now-infamous<br />\nHopkins students who executed a<br />\ncommon college prank.<br /><br />\nGeorge Tiller<br /><br />\nMore Cooperation<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\na widely accepted fact here that if<br />\nIn the spirit of greater anybody is going to be studying cooperation between Johns it's bound to be at Hopkins.

The temper of an<br />\ninstitution has chang,ed, and what<br />\nseemed to be all-important only a<br />\nfew years ago seems almost futile<br />\nnow.

That<br />\npattern, perceived after far less<br />\nthan 42 months shows Hopkins to<br />\nbe an institution like any other,<br />\nreplete with incompetence,<br />\ndishonesty, stupidity, and yes, in<br />\naddition, a noble desire to provide<br />\nthe best mankind can offer in his<br />\nquest for truth and knowledge.<br />\nThe paper has reflected<br />\nHopkins' development since 1970.<br />\nThen, each edition was filled with<br />\naccounts of Lincoln Gordon's<br />\nlatest administrative fiasco, stories<br />\nof student agitations, and concern<br />\nover the quality of Homewood's<br />\nacademic offerings. Then, everyone<br />\nknew that Lincoln Gordon had no<br />\nmOre business being president of a<br />\nuniversity than Evil Knievel does,<br />\nand the content of the News-Letter<br />\nreflected that perception. On the<br />\nacademic side, there was the story,<br />\ncomplete with dramatic front-page<br />\npicture, of the evening two<br />\nsymbolic coffins representing the<br />\nabolished Russian program and<br />\nEducation department were<br />\ninterred in the upper quad.<br />\nOver the years, the stories began<br />\nto reflect the inward turn taken by<br />\nmost students. The paper began to<br />\ncover the quality of food on<br /><br />\nadministrative expenditures. His<br />\noffice was in Homewood House<br />\nthen, in the former bedroom of<br />\nArchbishop Carroll, and it was<br />\nfilled with mementoes of his days<br />\nin the Kennedy administration,<br />\nfirst as ambassador to Brazil and<br />\nthen as Assistant Secretary of State<br />\nfor Inter-American Affairs.<br />\nThe memorabilia included an<br />\nautographed picture of Gordon<br />\nsitting with President Kennedy, the<br />\nflag that had flown over the<br />\nembassy in Rio and his official<br />\ncommissions of office, signed by<br />\neither Kennedy or Lyndon<br />\nJohnson, in whose administration<br />\nGordon also served. The story I<br />\nhad was something about federal<br />\nbudget cuts and it involved some<br />\ncomplicated figures, which Gordon<br />\nread from a neatly typed sheet of<br />\npaper in front of him.- At the close<br />\nof the interview, I asked him for<br />\nthe paper and he gave it to me. I<br />\nwent back to the office, wrote the<br />\nstory and forgot about the<br />\ndocument.<br />\nThe next morning I got a<br />\n\\<br />\n-1<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nfi<br /><br />\nany activity that s:TIT7; 4.result in<br /><br />\n\\ CV...0<br /><br />\nVANCIINe<br /><br />\nthat' \u2022<br /><br />\nrigu re s<br /><br />\nwri7;<br /><br />\non<br /><br />\nCaW.<br /><br />\ntb,<br /><br />\nit,'' a<br /><br />\nit.cova<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\n',re/ 1,11c1Iwos<br /><br />\nbreathless<br /><br />\nThe temper of an institution has<br /><br />\nchanged, and what seemed<br /><br />\nall-important only a few years ago<br /><br />\nseems almost futile now.<br />\nimmediate and tangible personal<br />\nreward.

The meeting could not<br />\nhave led to much success, for<br />\nwithin a month, Gordon was out<br /><br />\nof a job.<br />\nMuch later, the News-Letter<br />\nhappened onto the tale of another<br />\nadministrative incompetent, this<br />\none in the admissions office,<br />\npresided over by John R.

The position of Young<br />\nTrustee offers the Board<br />\nof Trustees : the opportunity<br />\nto stay abreast of current<br />\nstudent's thinking with regards<br />\nto all Hopkins affairs. From the<br />\npast four yours I've tried to<br />\nwork with students, faculty,<br />\nand adminisstration to do what<br />\nI thought was right in helping<br />\nto improve education and life in<br />\ngeneral at Johns Hopkins. I<br />\nhave a great respect for the<br />\nquality of education at Johns<br />\nHopkins but I quite realize that<br />\nthe University doesn't live up to<br />\nwhat might be a much greater<br />\npotential. And<br />\nguess in all<br />\nhonesty I feel my work for four<br />\nyears along with a very real<br />\ndesire -to help direct the<br />\nUniversity in the future towards<br />\nthings which I think, and which<br />\nI think my fellow students<br />\nthink are important, moves me<br />\nto run for the position of<br />\nYoung Trustee. In terms of<br />\nqualifications for the positions<br />\nthe typical thing to do is to set<br />\nup a nice list of things which<br />\none has done over the past four<br />\nyears and point to these as<br /><br />\nqualifications. In my freshman<br />\nyear, a desire to participate in<br />\nthe Hopkins community and<br />\nthe Baltimore city community<br />\nmotivated my participation in<br />\nvarious campus and non-campus<br />\nactivities. During Freshman<br />\nyear, as a member of the<br />\nDormitory Student Residents<br />\nCouncil I tried to work to<br />\nimprove life for freshmen in the<br />\nDormitories. In addition, I<br />\nbecame involved in the<br />\nChaplain's office. My service<br />\nwith the Chaplain's office really<br />\nheightened my awareness of the<br />\nPotential that Hopkins has, the<br />\nentire university community,<br />\nfor serving the city of<br />\nBaltimore. My campus activities<br />\ninclude such things as helping<br />\nto write the 1973-1974<br />\nUniversity Catalogue, serving on<br />\nthe Student Council's selections<br />\ncommittee during my<br />\nsophomore year. being an<br />\nundergraduate student rep to<br />\nthe Student Conduct Code<br />\nCommittee, coordinating and<br />\ndirecting the first TEVAL at<br />\nHopkins, which is still<br />\ncontinuing. I've been an<br />\nundergraduate representative to<br />\nthe Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate tudies. Last<br />\nsummer. I was a student rep to<br />\nthe joint Goucher Hopkins<br />\nCommittee on the future of the<br />\ntwo schools, I've been a<br />\nrepresentative to the student<br />\ncouncil and this year I'm<br />\npresident of the Senior Class.<br />\nLast and by no means least, and<br />\nperhaps the most important<br />\nthing to me, has been my role<br />\nas student assistant to the Dean,<br />\nor student ombudsman. I've<br />\nworked with both Deans,<br />\nchairmen of the departments,<br />\nwith members of the Board of<br />\nTrustees and with various other<br />\nfaculty members.<br />\nBene t ta Mansfield: I'm a<br />\nstudent and I'm an active<br />\nstudent. But I really don't feel<br />\nthat there's any special<br />\nqualification that makes you a<br />\ngood Young Trustee. I've been<br /><br />\nvery active both inside school<br />\nand off the campus. But having<br />\nspoken to the present young<br />\nTrustees, I Oink the<br />\nundergraduate body here knows<br />\nvery little about what the<br />\nposition encompasses. I don't<br />\nthink that serving on the<br />\nStudent Council or working on<br />\nstudent organizations<br />\nnecessarily qualifies one for<br />\nTrustee. When I went in front<br />\nof the Board of Trustees last<br />\nyear, on behalf of the Student<br />\nCouncil, I felt that they were<br />\nvery interested and receptive to<br />\nthe problems of Homewood. I<br />\nthink I could represent our<br />\nviews in that body. I'm running<br />\nbecause I sincerely want the<br />\njob, and I'm sincerely interested<br />\nin the future of the school. I<br />\nfeel that I could serve my<br />\nconstitutents,\u2022 and by my<br />\nconstituents I mean .the<br />\nundergraduates of Hopkins. I<br />\nthink there's an awful lot of<br />\nrepresentation on the Board for<br />\nthe Med school, and I think the<br />\nvieWs of the undergraduates<br />\nhave to be conveyed to the<br />\nBoard.<br />\nQuestion: What programs or<br />\nin which areas of University<br />\naffairs would you like to see the<br />\nBoard devote its attention to in<br />\nits upcoming sessions?<br />\nShep Hoffman: I believe the<br />\ntrustees have expressed a very<br />\nsincere interest in trying to<br />\nUnderstand the position,<br />\nopinions, and feelings of the<br />\nundergraduate at Johns<br />\nHopkins. This is certainly, in<br />\nlarge part, evidenced by the<br />\npresence of the four Young<br />\nTrustees on the Board of<br />\nTrustees In this regard, I would<br />\ngenerally like to see the Board<br />\ndevote more time to trying to<br />\nrealize to what, in fact, the<br />\nposition of an Undergraduate<br />\nstudent at Johns Hopkins is.<br />\nSpecifically, I Would direct<br />\nmyself to a few proposals.<br />\nTrends throughout the country,<br />\nnot just in University tuition,<br />\nbut in all finances, have shown<br /><br />\nus all that everything is only<br />\ngoing to cost more. At Hopkins<br />\ntuition is going up. It's going to<br />\ncontinue to go up. I feel very<br />\nstrongly that some alternative,<br />\nnew alternatives, must be<br />\nsought t pass on the increased<br />\ncosts of education to the<br />\nstudents, both undergraduate<br />\nand gi-aduate. I feel very<br />\nstrongly that we insure that no<br />\nstudent is turned away from<br />\nHopkins for financial reasons. I<br />\nbelieve, in addition, that it is<br />\ncertainly within the Board's<br />\ncharge to urge the office of<br />\nadmissions, to seek out a more<br />\ndiverse body for admission. The<br />\nquality and diversity of the<br />\nHopkins faculty is not in tune<br />\nwith the quality and diversity<br />\nof its students. Finally, it is<br />\nimportant, even vital, that we<br />\nraise funds to sustain the<br />\nUniversity. In addition to<br />\nstrengthening the University's<br />\nendowment, I would like to see<br />\nthe Board strengthen the<br />\nquality of education at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBenetta Mansfield: First of<br />\nall, I want to beg the question a<br />\nlittle. I can remember the<br />\ncandidates running and making<br />\na lot of promises. I don't<br />\nbelieve a candidate for Young<br />\nTrustee can make promises. I<br />\nthink that one person on a<br />\nboard of 50 Trustees has very<br />\nlittle power to get a program<br />\nacross or to get anything<br />\nthrough the Board. The biggest<br />\nfault I see in electing young<br />\ntrustees is that we elect them<br />\nand then we never hear from<br />\nthem again. I think that it's<br />\nreally important that a Young<br />\nTrustee write articles for the<br />\nNews-Letter, as to what's going<br />\non with the Board of Trustees,<br />\nto come back the day before<br />\nthe Trustee meeting and spend<br />\nthe entire day on campus<br />\ntalking to students and seeing<br />\nhow they feel, to keep in<br />\ncontact with student<br />\norganizations and seeing what<br />\nthey're doing. I see that as my<br /><br />\nmost important function on the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, to keep in<br />\ncontact with the<br />\nundergraduates. As to what I'd<br />\nlike to see the Board deal with,<br />\nI think the school has many<br />\nproblems. I would hope that<br />\nthe Board will deal with the<br />\nproblems that the library is<br />\nencountering, that is<br />\novercrowding, low finances, and<br />\na deficient collection. Also I<br />\nwould urge the Board to deal<br />\nwith the problem of housing,<br />\neither by building more dorms<br />\nor by buying up more housing<br />\n,in Homewood. The freshmen<br />\nand the \"upperclassmen are<br />\nfrantic each spring looking for<br />\nhousing in a tight housing<br />\nsituation. I think that the<br />\nadmissions policy of the school<br />\nneeds some revision. I,<br />\nunderstand that the school<br />\nnever intends to have an<br />\nequalization of men and<br />\nwomen. I think this, is very<br />\nwrong. I don't advocate a<br />\nquota, however I think that<br />\nadmissions standards should be<br />\nfair to everyone. I think it's<br />\nvery important to recruit and<br />\nincrease the applicant pool in<br />\nevery subject in the school. I<br />\nwant to stress again how<br />\nimportant I think it is for a<br />\nYoung Trustee to be<br />\nresponsible to keep the<br />\nundergraduates informed about<br />\nwhat's going on. Both<br />\ncandidates who have announced<br />\n[their, candidacy] for the<br />\nstudent council presidency have<br />\nstressed the need to improve<br />\nacademics here. It would be to<br />\nthe benefit of any young<br />\nTrustee to keep informed of<br />\nwhat the undergraduates want<br />\nand need, and in turn to try to<br />\nkeep the Board informed of<br />\nwhat is going on.
