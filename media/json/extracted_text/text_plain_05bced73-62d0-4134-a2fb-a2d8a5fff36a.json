At a gathering of<br />\nstudent leaders at Evergreen house in<br />\nSeptember, he said, \"Some University<br />\nstaff members were upset when they<br />\nheard I agreed to be president of the<br />\nHopkins Hospital, so I told them that<br />\nthey haven't lost a president; they've<br />\ngained a hospital.\"<br />\nHe has also become mote frank in what<br />\nhe says about Hopkins and its programs.<br />\nLast fall, he told a group of Hopkins<br />\nalumni, now for the most part faculty<br />\nmembers of American universities, \"My<br />\n<br />\nown personal view, for what it's worth, is<br />\nthat undergraduate education in thc<br />\nUnited States is a real mess, but I don'i<br />\nknow whether Hopkins can or should dc<br />\nanything about it.

So credible is this<br />\nnaturalistic picture of urban decay (we<br />\nsee cheap bars, diners, hotel rooms,<br />\nlocker rooms and even the inside of a<br />\ntoilet) that you come out of the theater<br />\nlooking for a Wash-'n-Dry.

And after his second fight ends<br />\nwith his swift defeat, we hardly ever see<br />\nhim again.

On<br />\nThursday, Coach Gary Rupert's<br />\nfive played one of the finest<br />\ngames in Homewood history,<br />\npasting Lebanon Valley, the 7th<br />\nranked small callege squad in<br />\nAmerica. A scant two days later,<br />\nhowever, the Jays were way<br />\noff-form and dropped an 84-70<br />\nverdict to the University Division<br />\nDrexel Dragons<br />\nAgainst Drexel, JHU was<br />\noutplayed in every phase of the<br />\ngame. The visitors from<br />\nPhiladelphia hit a workman-like<br />\n42% from the floor (47% in the<br />\nfirst half) while their host's<br />\naverage was an icy 31%(and only<br />\nan incredible 23% in the first<br />\nhalf).<br />\nThe dragons handily<br />\noutrebounded the Blue Jays<br />\n51-32, splitting their boardwork<br />\nevenly between the five starters.<br />\n6-7 forward Terry Parks and<br />\nexciting guard Greg Newman<br />\nhauled down 10 'bound apiece<br />\nwhile teammate Korwek had 9,<br />\nDoug While had 8, and guard<br />\nMike Fee had 7. Bill Jews did a<br />\ncreditable job underneath for<br />\nHopkins, grabbing 9, while 5-9<br />\nguard John Rutter, who was<br />\nmagnificent throughout, was<br />\ncredited with 8. The fact that<br />\nlittle Rutter outrebounded every<br />\nother JHU starter but Jews<br />\nindicates in part the domination<br />\nDrexel's front line possessed over<br />\n<br />\nHopkins'.<br />\nDrexel's overall balance<br />\nshowed, not only under the<br />\nbackboards, but in the scoring<br />\ncolumn. Again, Parks and<br />\nNewman tied for team honors,<br />\ntallying 18 points each. Most of<br />\nParks' were from directly<br />\nbeneath, but Newman's were<br />\nfrom all over the court, with<br />\nsome coming on drives so<br />\nbeautiful that even the home<br />\ncrowd responded with cheers.<br />\nAlso scoring in double figures<br />\nwere Fee, with 14 points,\u2022mostly<br />\nfrom well outside, and almost<br />\nalways in the clutch, and<br />\nKorwek, with 13.<br />\nJews and Rutter were the only<br />\nBlue Jays with more than 9<br />\nmarkers. The 6-7 center had 23,<br />\nthe game high, and Rutter had<br />\n14, all from a distance.<br />\nHopkins opened with their<br />\ntriangle and two zone defense<br />\nwhich proved quite ineffective<br />\nthis time. Drexel moved out to a<br />\n6-0 lead before Chuck Laberge<br />\nmade a three-point play to cut<br />\nthe lead in half. The visitors<br />\ncontinued to score with little<br />\ndifficulty as the half progressed,<br />\nbut Jews tallied eight points on a<br />\njumper from the baseline, a 25<br />\nfooter from behind the key, a<br />\ngorgeous tip-in, and two free<br />\nthrows, to cut the gap to 21-15.<br />\nWith the dragons in distress,<br />\nNewman answered Jews' flurry<br />\nwith six unanswered points, two<br />\non drives and one on a 20 foot<br />\nshot from the corner. After long<br />\npops by Rutter and Jews negated<br />\n<br />\nJays pinned again;<br />\nlook to W. Md.<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nLast Saturday the Blue Jay<br />\ngrapplers traveled to Towson to<br />\nwrestle the Tigers. They returned<br />\nwith their second defeat in a row<br />\n24-1 5, Lowering their season<br />\nrecord to 6-3. Although<br />\nSaturday's score showed a much<br />\nbetter match than last year's 39-5<br />\nBlue Jay defeat, the Hopkins'<br />\nteam went into the match<br />\nbelieving that they could pull out<br />\na win.<br />\nWith Towson pulling some<br />\nunexpected personnel changes,<br />\nthe Tigers managed to beat the<br />\nJays at Hopkin's strong-point,<br />\nwhich is to say, the co-captains,<br />\nStevens and Hazard.<br />\nRon Pucillo started things off<br />\nwith a nice comeback from a 2-2<br />\ntie early in his match to defeat<br />\nhis opponent 9-2. Pucillo put his<br />\nman on his back once and kept<br />\ncontrol throughout the match.<br />\nMike Privitera got caught off<br />\nhis feet in the first period and<br />\nwas put directly on his back and<br />\npinned at 1:12. Clark Kingery,<br />\nwho seems to be getting his old<br />\nform back, won his match 9-0<br />\nwhile his opponent stalled as not<br />\nto allow Kingery to get the fall.<br />\nRob Fink, undefeated in four<br />\nmatches, wrestled what his coach<br />\ntermed \"a very intelligent\"<br />\nmatch. Fink won his match on<br />\nriding time 2-1.<br />\nFred Goldman was matched<br />\nagainst last year's Maryland state<br />\nchampion who proved as<br />\n<br />\nformidable as his title. Goldman<br />\nwas pinned at 4:00. Dave Mulock<br />\nlost 8-1 on three takedowns<br />\nduring his match while co-captain<br />\nCraig Stevens lost to a man who<br />\nfinished second in the state last<br />\nyear.<br />\nStevens, who was wresting<br />\nwith bruised ribs didn't seem to<br />\nbe up to par, which could be a<br />\nresult of his injury in last week's<br />\nmatch with Lebanon Valley.<br />\nAlthough he had a takedown,<br />\nStevens lost 10-4.<br />\nWayne Panullo lost a decision<br />\nto a much more experienced<br />\nwrestler. Co-captain Neil Hazard<br />\nwrestled a man whom he had<br />\nbeaten 3-2 last year and now<br />\nwrestles heavyweight for the<br />\nTigers but dropped to 190<br />\npounds especially to wrestle<br />\nHazard. His opponent, who was<br />\nobviously much more psyched<br />\nfor the match than Hazard,<br />\ndefeated Neil 8-3.<br />\nHeavyweight Gary Murza<br />\nwrestled Towson's 190 pounder,<br />\nwho with thirty seconds left in<br />\nthe match was disqualified for<br />\nstalling.<br />\nHad both the Blue Jay<br />\nco-captains not been beaten, the<br />\nvictory would probably have<br />\nbeen registered with the Hopkins'<br />\nteam.<br />\nTomorrow the Jays travel to<br />\nWestchester to compete against<br />\nWestern Maryland, who defeated<br />\nTowson earlier in the season. The<br />\nmatch will begin at 3:00 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert<br />\nagain cut to 6 at 31-25. Schreiber<br />\nDrexel buckets, the Blue Jays,<br />\naimed from thirty feet but the<br />\nwith 5 minutes left in the half,<br />\nfans' groans died away quickly<br />\nmade their only interesting rally.<br />\nwhen the shot dropped through,<br />\nFabulous Feed<br />\nslicing the lead to four.<br />\nSub Andy Schreiber entered<br />\nDrexel, as if they were a child<br />\nthe game and scored almost<br />\ncruelly teasing their pet with an<br />\nimmediately on a fabulous feed<br />\nout-of-reach toy, then scored<br />\nfrom Jews. Paul Spence then hit<br />\nnine in a row, extending the<br />\ntwo free throws and Jews yet<br />\nbulge to 40-27. After Laberge hit<br />\nanother jumper, and the lead was<br />\n<br />\ntwo free throws, Newman<br />\nanswered with a circus, behind<br />\nthe back pass to Parks for an easy<br />\nlayup. When Newman banked<br />\none in at the buzzer, the lead had<br />\ngrown to 46-29.<br />\nFree Throws<br />\nThe margin grew to 21, at<br />\n54-33 early in the second half<br />\nbefore the Hoppies attempted<br />\none last fling. Six points each by<br />\nJews and Rutter and two free<br />\nthrows by frosh Drew Fender<br />\nreduced the lead to 64-51. A<br />\nminute later, Bobby Freedman<br />\nscored from underneath,<br />\nnarrowing the gap to 68-56 and<br />\ncausing a Drexel timeout.<br />\nAgain, the visitors responded<br />\nimmediately. This time Fee hit<br />\ntwice from the outside and the<br />\nlead went back to an<br />\nunapproachable 18 points. The<br />\nloss dropped Hopkins record to<br />\n9-8 while the winners upped<br />\ntheir's to 10-4.

Soon<br />\nafter he arrived, some of his other<br />\nqualities began to show, including his<br />\nsense of humor, perception, and skills in<br />\npublic relations.<br />\nDean George Owen commented, \"He's<br />\nhuman being and he reassures<br />\ntruly<br />\na<br />\npeople who deal with him by his depth of<br />\nunderstanding.<br />\n\"I've seen him in the presence of<br /><br />\nscholars, students, politicians anr<br />\nbusinessmen and he gives them a real<br />\nsense of confidence in Hopkins just by<br />\nthe way he deals with them,\" Owen<br />\nadded.<br />\nSince becoming president, Muller has<br />\nbeen more relaxed and willing to indulge<br />\nhis sense of humor. At a gathering of<br />\nstudent leaders at Evergreen house in<br />\nSeptember, he said, \"Some University<br />\nstaff members were upset when they<br />\nheard I agreed to be president of the<br />\nHopkins Hospital, so I told them that<br />\nthey haven't lost a president; they've<br />\ngained a hospital.\"<br />\nHe has also become mote frank in what<br />\nhe says about Hopkins and its programs.<br />\nLast fall, he told a group of Hopkins<br />\nalumni, now for the most part faculty<br />\nmembers of American universities, \"My<br /><br />\nown personal view, for what it's worth, is<br />\nthat undergraduate education in thc<br />\nUnited States is a real mess, but I don'i<br />\nknow whether Hopkins can or should dc<br />\nanything about it.

John Huston and<br />\ncinematographer Conrad Hall have done a<br />\nmagnificent job evoking a rich, seedy<br />\natmosphere that never ceases to be<br />\nstriking and suggestive. So credible is this<br />\nnaturalistic picture of urban decay (we<br />\nsee cheap bars, diners, hotel rooms,<br />\nlocker rooms and even the inside of a<br />\ntoilet) that you come out of the theater<br />\nlooking for a Wash-'n-Dry.

But such clues to<br />\ncharacter are tnn often lost in<br />\nGiven the several possible contrasts and<br />\nsimilarities that these disparate characters<br />\nmight have afforded, the film as a study<br />\nof characters is disappointing. Keach is<br />\nusually very good, but because Billy's<br />\npersonality is so spottily revealed a lot of<br />\nKeach's behavior seems actorly and<br />\neccentric. Jeff Bridges, although perfectly<br />\nbelievable at all times, is so boring that he<br />\ncould probably win fights by talking<br />\nhis opponent in the ring and putting him<br />\nto sleep. And after his second fight ends<br />\nwith his swift defeat, we hardly ever see<br />\nhim again. The characters' development is<br />\nhindered by the movie's episodic<br />\nstructure, which seems to lack some<br />\nimpregnates and then marries with little<br /><br />\nfuss, is uneventful.<br /><br />\nsomebody's throaty reminiscence not<br />\ntrusted to the pertinent character himself.<br />\nStockton informs Fat City with all the<br />\nclarity.of development that would have<br />\nbenefitted the characters.

We see the<br />\nsoftly-lit, faded remnants of a bygone era<br />\n(old signs, splintering clapboard,<br />\nanarchronistic cars) and hear a lot of<br />\ngentle C&amp;W guitar riffs (as well as Kris<br />\nKristofferson singing \"Hilp Me Make It<br />\nThrew Th' Nat).

Equally<br />\ntasteless was your remark about John<br />\nBarth and the spelling of \"literary.\"<br />\nAlso, I cannot comprehend how Barth<br />\ndeserves such reporting in what should<br />\nhave been an objective news article<br />\nentitled \"Barth, Kenner to Join Faculty.\"<br />\nThe paragraph beginning \"Mr. Barth, who<br />\nclaims to have escaped Hopkins with 'a C<br />\naverage, A'sand flunks,\" also smacks of<br /><br />\nbe kiddin<br /><br />\nPd.]<br /><br />\nHeadmen,\" \"Tragic Magic,\" \"Glad,\"<br />\n\"Freedom Rider,\" and \"Empty Pages\"<br />\nwere all performed, a good mixture of<br />\ntheir old and new works. I think that a<br />\nnumber of people missed hearing some of<br />\nthe very earliest songs, songs such as<br />\n\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" and \"Feeling<br />\nAlright.\" But groups must grow tired of<br />\nperforming the same songs year after<br />\nyear, and Traffic has been doing \"Dear<br />\nMr. Fantasy\" since its release in April '68.<br />\nThe show stopped after an hour and a<br />\nhalf (and thirteen songs), and the crowd<br />\nbegged three minutes for an encore.

And 100 years ago,<br />\nthat kind of reading didn't cause any problems. You could keep up with what was happening pretty well.<br />\nBut today, our knowledge is expanding so<br />\nfast that people who want to keep ahead are<br />\nactually falling behind. There's simply too<br />\nmuch to read \u2014 too much homework \u2014 too<br />\nmany magazines \u2014 too many books \u2014 too<br />\nmany reports and memos. What's the solution? Learn how to read faster and better.<br />\nYou can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other<br />\npeople have done it. People who have different jobs, different IQs, different interests,<br />\ndifferent educations have completed the<br />\ncourse. Our graduates are people from all<br />\nwalks of life. These people have all taken a<br />\ncourse developed by Evelyn Wood, a promi-<br /><br />\nnent educator. Practically all of them at least<br />\ntripled their reading speed with equal or better comprehension. Most have increased it<br />\neven more.<br />\nThink for a moment what that means. All of<br />\nthem \u2014 even the slowest \u2014 now read an average novel in less than two hours. They read<br />\nan entire issue of Time or Newsweek in 35<br />\nminutes. They don't skip or skim. They read<br />\nevery word. They use no machines. Instead,<br />\nthey let the material they're reading determine how fast they read. And mark this well:<br />\nthey actually understand more, remember<br />\nmore, and enjoy. more than when they read<br />\nslowly. That's right! They understand more.<br />\nThey remember more. They enjoy more.<br />\nYou can do the same thing\u2014the place to<br />\nlearn more about it is at a free speed reading<br />\nlesson.<br />\nThis is the same course President Kennedy<br /><br />\nhad his Joint Chiefs of Staff take.

On<br />\nThursday, Coach Gary Rupert's<br />\nfive played one of the finest<br />\ngames in Homewood history,<br />\npasting Lebanon Valley, the 7th<br />\nranked small callege squad in<br />\nAmerica. A scant two days later,<br />\nhowever, the Jays were way<br />\noff-form and dropped an 84-70<br />\nverdict to the University Division<br />\nDrexel Dragons<br />\nAgainst Drexel, JHU was<br />\noutplayed in every phase of the<br />\ngame. The visitors from<br />\nPhiladelphia hit a workman-like<br />\n42% from the floor (47% in the<br />\nfirst half) while their host's<br />\naverage was an icy 31%(and only<br />\nan incredible 23% in the first<br />\nhalf).<br />\nThe dragons handily<br />\noutrebounded the Blue Jays<br />\n51-32, splitting their boardwork<br />\nevenly between the five starters.<br />\n6-7 forward Terry Parks and<br />\nexciting guard Greg Newman<br />\nhauled down 10 'bound apiece<br />\nwhile teammate Korwek had 9,<br />\nDoug While had 8, and guard<br />\nMike Fee had 7. Bill Jews did a<br />\ncreditable job underneath for<br />\nHopkins, grabbing 9, while 5-9<br />\nguard John Rutter, who was<br />\nmagnificent throughout, was<br />\ncredited with 8. The fact that<br />\nlittle Rutter outrebounded every<br />\nother JHU starter but Jews<br />\nindicates in part the domination<br />\nDrexel's front line possessed over<br /><br />\nHopkins'.<br />\nDrexel's overall balance<br />\nshowed, not only under the<br />\nbackboards, but in the scoring<br />\ncolumn. Again, Parks and<br />\nNewman tied for team honors,<br />\ntallying 18 points each. Most of<br />\nParks' were from directly<br />\nbeneath, but Newman's were<br />\nfrom all over the court, with<br />\nsome coming on drives so<br />\nbeautiful that even the home<br />\ncrowd responded with cheers.<br />\nAlso scoring in double figures<br />\nwere Fee, with 14 points,\u2022mostly<br />\nfrom well outside, and almost<br />\nalways in the clutch, and<br />\nKorwek, with 13.<br />\nJews and Rutter were the only<br />\nBlue Jays with more than 9<br />\nmarkers. The 6-7 center had 23,<br />\nthe game high, and Rutter had<br />\n14, all from a distance.<br />\nHopkins opened with their<br />\ntriangle and two zone defense<br />\nwhich proved quite ineffective<br />\nthis time. Drexel moved out to a<br />\n6-0 lead before Chuck Laberge<br />\nmade a three-point play to cut<br />\nthe lead in half. The visitors<br />\ncontinued to score with little<br />\ndifficulty as the half progressed,<br />\nbut Jews tallied eight points on a<br />\njumper from the baseline, a 25<br />\nfooter from behind the key, a<br />\ngorgeous tip-in, and two free<br />\nthrows, to cut the gap to 21-15.<br />\nWith the dragons in distress,<br />\nNewman answered Jews' flurry<br />\nwith six unanswered points, two<br />\non drives and one on a 20 foot<br />\nshot from the corner. After long<br />\npops by Rutter and Jews negated<br /><br />\nJays pinned again;<br />\nlook to W. Md.<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nLast Saturday the Blue Jay<br />\ngrapplers traveled to Towson to<br />\nwrestle the Tigers. They returned<br />\nwith their second defeat in a row<br />\n24-1 5, Lowering their season<br />\nrecord to 6-3. Although<br />\nSaturday's score showed a much<br />\nbetter match than last year's 39-5<br />\nBlue Jay defeat, the Hopkins'<br />\nteam went into the match<br />\nbelieving that they could pull out<br />\na win.<br />\nWith Towson pulling some<br />\nunexpected personnel changes,<br />\nthe Tigers managed to beat the<br />\nJays at Hopkin's strong-point,<br />\nwhich is to say, the co-captains,<br />\nStevens and Hazard.<br />\nRon Pucillo started things off<br />\nwith a nice comeback from a 2-2<br />\ntie early in his match to defeat<br />\nhis opponent 9-2. Pucillo put his<br />\nman on his back once and kept<br />\ncontrol throughout the match.<br />\nMike Privitera got caught off<br />\nhis feet in the first period and<br />\nwas put directly on his back and<br />\npinned at 1:12. Clark Kingery,<br />\nwho seems to be getting his old<br />\nform back, won his match 9-0<br />\nwhile his opponent stalled as not<br />\nto allow Kingery to get the fall.<br />\nRob Fink, undefeated in four<br />\nmatches, wrestled what his coach<br />\ntermed \"a very intelligent\"<br />\nmatch. Fink won his match on<br />\nriding time 2-1.<br />\nFred Goldman was matched<br />\nagainst last year's Maryland state<br />\nchampion who proved as<br /><br />\nformidable as his title. Goldman<br />\nwas pinned at 4:00. Dave Mulock<br />\nlost 8-1 on three takedowns<br />\nduring his match while co-captain<br />\nCraig Stevens lost to a man who<br />\nfinished second in the state last<br />\nyear.<br />\nStevens, who was wresting<br />\nwith bruised ribs didn't seem to<br />\nbe up to par, which could be a<br />\nresult of his injury in last week's<br />\nmatch with Lebanon Valley.<br />\nAlthough he had a takedown,<br />\nStevens lost 10-4.<br />\nWayne Panullo lost a decision<br />\nto a much more experienced<br />\nwrestler. Co-captain Neil Hazard<br />\nwrestled a man whom he had<br />\nbeaten 3-2 last year and now<br />\nwrestles heavyweight for the<br />\nTigers but dropped to 190<br />\npounds especially to wrestle<br />\nHazard. His opponent, who was<br />\nobviously much more psyched<br />\nfor the match than Hazard,<br />\ndefeated Neil 8-3.<br />\nHeavyweight Gary Murza<br />\nwrestled Towson's 190 pounder,<br />\nwho with thirty seconds left in<br />\nthe match was disqualified for<br />\nstalling.<br />\nHad both the Blue Jay<br />\nco-captains not been beaten, the<br />\nvictory would probably have<br />\nbeen registered with the Hopkins'<br />\nteam.<br />\nTomorrow the Jays travel to<br />\nWestchester to compete against<br />\nWestern Maryland, who defeated<br />\nTowson earlier in the season. The<br />\nmatch will begin at 3:00 P.M.<br /><br />\nCoach Gary Rupert<br />\nagain cut to 6 at 31-25. Schreiber<br />\nDrexel buckets, the Blue Jays,<br />\naimed from thirty feet but the<br />\nwith 5 minutes left in the half,<br />\nfans' groans died away quickly<br />\nmade their only interesting rally.<br />\nwhen the shot dropped through,<br />\nFabulous Feed<br />\nslicing the lead to four.<br />\nSub Andy Schreiber entered<br />\nDrexel, as if they were a child<br />\nthe game and scored almost<br />\ncruelly teasing their pet with an<br />\nimmediately on a fabulous feed<br />\nout-of-reach toy, then scored<br />\nfrom Jews. Paul Spence then hit<br />\nnine in a row, extending the<br />\ntwo free throws and Jews yet<br />\nbulge to 40-27. After Laberge hit<br />\nanother jumper, and the lead was<br /><br />\ntwo free throws, Newman<br />\nanswered with a circus, behind<br />\nthe back pass to Parks for an easy<br />\nlayup. When Newman banked<br />\none in at the buzzer, the lead had<br />\ngrown to 46-29.<br />\nFree Throws<br />\nThe margin grew to 21, at<br />\n54-33 early in the second half<br />\nbefore the Hoppies attempted<br />\none last fling. Six points each by<br />\nJews and Rutter and two free<br />\nthrows by frosh Drew Fender<br />\nreduced the lead to 64-51. A<br />\nminute later, Bobby Freedman<br />\nscored from underneath,<br />\nnarrowing the gap to 68-56 and<br />\ncausing a Drexel timeout.<br />\nAgain, the visitors responded<br />\nimmediately. This time Fee hit<br />\ntwice from the outside and the<br />\nlead went back to an<br />\nunapproachable 18 points. The<br />\nloss dropped Hopkins record to<br />\n9-8 while the winners upped<br />\ntheir's to 10-4.
