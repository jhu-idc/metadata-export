Even President<br />\nMuller, who is usually good about giving<br />\nthe students an answer, has ducked for<br />\ncover, saying he can't clarify the issue<br />\nbecause he doesn't know.<br />\nThe most important issue is: Is Dean<br />\nHooker going to be replaced by one person,<br />\nwho will act as he did, as an ear and a voice<br />\nfor undergraduate student concerns on<br />\nacademics \u2014 or isn't he? Muller originally<br />\nsays yes, the remaining deans say no.<br />\nMuller says he can't clarify. Baby, talk to<br />\nme.<br />\nThe administration's oafishness in<br />\nissuing statements would be funny, if the<br />\nfate of student concerns didn't to some<br />\nextent hang in the balance. Maybe they<br />\ndon't realize that students and their concerns are hanging: one administrator said<br />\nrecently, \"I'm sure the kids [meaning us]<br />\nwill have several people togototo voice their<br />\nconcerns, any of whom will be happy to<br />\ntalk to them.\" This statement exhibits<br />\nsuch seemingly innocent obliviousness that<br />\nit almost has to indicate that administrators<br />\nare unaware of, as much as unconcerned<br />\nwith, what's at stake for undergraduates<br />\nhere. The kids don't want several people to<br />\ngo to.

Hopkins, where the<br />\nfaculty rule supreme, is not an easy place<br />\nto represent student concerns.<br />\nThe record shows that, even under<br />\nthe present structure, undergraduate student concerns are bottom priority.

If<br />\nHooker's duties are split up among the<br />\nassociate deans, the simple fragmenting of<br />\nresponsibilities to the CUS will alone make<br />\nmatters worse. And if, as Peifer has said,<br />\nlack of tenure has weakened Hooker's clout<br />\nwith the Academic Council, what will it do<br />\nto someone who is just an administrator?<br />\nHooker at least is an assistant professor.<br />\nThere is a tendency on the part of<br />\nmost students, especially those who do not<br />\nfollow campus politics, to tune out a story<br />\nabout a bunch of administrators playing<br />\nmusical deans. For your own good, don't<br />\nthis time. Hooker's job has an extremely<br />\nimportant effect on the courses we take,<br />\nand the grade system we work under, for<br />\nstarters.

Dzura<br />\n<br />\nRock Ban Elitism<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nTo flaunt your riches, so<br />\nthey say, has become acceptable<br />\nonce again. And so has snobbery. One institution in Baltimore that has led this trend is<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nA few months ago, the<br />\nstudent council of JHU banned<br />\nall rock music from the annual<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair held at Hopkins'<br />\nHomewood Campus. After a<br />\nsmall but persistent outcry by<br />\nsome students, a councilimposed -compromise\" was imposed to severely restrict all<br />\npopular music and limit it to<br />\nisolated areas.<br />\nThe student<br />\ncouncil and school administration claimed that the reasoning<br />\nbehind the decision was security,<br />\nbut an investigation reveals a<br />\nmuch stronger strain of antiBaltimore elitism. Statements<br />\ntaken from the Hopkins' NewsLetter on this issue are quite<br />\nrevealing.<br />\nIn reference to the ban:<br />\n\"The controversy stems from<br />\nthe - presence of unwelcome<br />\nindividuals on campus due to the<br />\nfair, people who bring their own<br />\nbeer and food. . .These 'undesirables' allegedly camp out on the<br />\nlawn contributing little to the<br />\nfestival.\"<br />\nPerhaps the word<br />\n\"money\" should be inserted<br />\nbetween the words \"little\" and<br />\n\"to\".<br />\nWho are these \"undesirables\"? The News-Letter reports:<br />\n\"Security [Hopkins' police]<br />\nfeels confident that the greatest<br />\npercentage of all acts of vandalism are caused by non-students.\"<br />\nCitizens of the surrounding<br />\ncommunity were first \"undesirables\", and now they are<br />\n\"vandals\".<br />\nSignificantly, no<br />\nfacts and no proof has been<br />\npresented to back up security's<br />\n<br />\nclaims - their actions are based<br />\nsolely on assumptions.<br />\nOne of the directors of the<br />\n1981 Spring Fair then declared,<br />\n\"If we give them [the \"undesirables\"] any rock music at all,<br />\nthey'll hang out and hope for<br />\nmore. . .Students can appreciate<br />\ndiversity. Let's bore the nonstudents to death with culture.\"<br />\nThis statement reflects an all too<br />\ncommon attitude on Hopkins<br />\ncampus that the working people<br />\nof the surrounding community<br />\nare somehow inferior and have<br />\nno right to even come onto the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe attempted ban and<br />\ncontinued limitation on rock<br />\nmusic perpetuates this kind of<br />\nignorant elitism.

Interior Secretary James Watt's bill (HR<br />\n5603), deceitfully introduced to<br />\nCongress as \"The Wilderness<br />\nProtection Act of 1982\", proposes the opening of all wilderness areas to uninhibited development after the year 2000.<br />\nThis bill would allow the PresiSave The Penguins<br />\ndent to open any \"protected\"<br />\nwilderness area to mining, drillTo the Edjtor:<br />\ning, and private development<br />\nI suggest as a solution to the before the year 2000 if he found<br />\ndispute in the Falklands that<br />\n* cont. on p. 13<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Views Of Sexism Reflect Society's<br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\ndiscrepancy between the level of<br />\nwhich even<br />\nseriousness with<br />\nother women take the academic<br />\nwork of women,and the level of<br />\nrespect they accord the work of<br />\nmen.<br />\nJoan (the names of the<br />\nstudents have been changed)<br />\ntransferred to Hopkins in her<br />\nsophomore year. The male/female ratio strikes her as a<br />\nproblem: \"You can walk down<br />\nthe hallway all the way around<br />\nGilman and not see a single<br />\nwoman. . it [the ratio] doesn't<br />\naffect me so much that 1 think<br />\nabout it all the time, but it does<br />\naffect me enough to think about<br />\nit.\" Joan feels she has been<br />\ntreated fairly here; in fact she<br />\nfeels sometimes she had been<br />\ntreated more than fairly. She is<br />\nsure she got into a playwriting<br />\nclass only because they needed<br />\nmore women. She also believes<br />\nthis is why she was admitted to<br />\nHopkins: \"I'm sure I wouldn't<br />\nhave gotten in here if I were a<br />\nguy.\"<br />\nContrary to her belief, the<br />\nAdmission Office does not lower<br />\nits objective standards for women; it accepts a percentage of<br />\nwomen proportional to the<br />\npercentage who apply. But<br />\nwhen Joan learned of the<br />\nmale/female ratio, she assumed<br />\nshe was admitted because of her<br />\nsex. Her choice of interpretation - that she was admitted<br />\nbecause of her sex and not<br />\nbecause of her intellectual qualifications - reflects the larger<br />\nattitudes of a sexist society. Her<br />\nchoice exemplifies the same<br />\nproblem found in the Golberg<br />\nstudy - she has been taught to<br />\n<br />\ndevalue her own work.<br />\nAnother student, Beth, is a<br />\nsocial science major doing an<br />\nindependent study in the humanities. Her professor has been<br />\nencouraging about her work, but<br />\nshe says, \"I don't know whether<br />\nhe likes my work or just thinks<br />\nI'm cute.\" She feels that he<br />\nvalues their friendship but does<br />\nnot accept her as a colleague.<br />\nShe believes he would not flatter<br />\nher work as much if he were not<br />\npersonally attracted to her.<br />\nBecause his criticism is not harsh<br />\n'enough, Beth feels she has not<br />\nmade the kinds of improvements<br />\nshe could have. Her observations could be correct, and if<br />\nthey are, the professor is not<br />\ntaking her education as seriously as he should. On the other<br />\nhand, her work could truly<br />\nwarrant his compliments. But<br />\ninstead of attributing her success<br />\nto her talent, Beth has chosen to<br />\nattribute it to her attractiveness,<br />\nand thus undersells her own<br />\nintellectual capabilities. If Beth<br />\nis not simply insecure about her<br />\ntalent, this example shows how<br />\nshe has learned to view men's<br />\nperceptions of women.<br />\nOne housemaster interviewed said that it seemed to her<br />\nthat more women have dropped<br />\nout of the science majors than<br />\nmen. She feels this may be<br />\npartly due to advisors being all<br />\ntoo willing to encourage women<br />\nto switch majors when they run<br />\ninto difficulties. Ann, a former<br />\nscience major, found her classes<br />\ndifficult, as most Hopkins students do. However, she says she<br />\nshe did not have the competitive<br />\ndrive she needed to keep up,and<br />\nattributes this to her early<br />\n<br />\neducation. She believes women<br />\nare taught not to sacrifice<br />\npersonal relationships for achievement.<br />\n\"Relationships are equally<br />\nimportant as school for women,\" she says. \"This makes<br />\nthings more difficult for a<br />\nwoman in a high-powered field<br />\nbecause she has to make<br />\nchoices.\" Ann's opinions reflect<br />\ndeeply rooted societal problems<br />\nthat cannot be merely attributed<br />\nto the atmosphere created in one<br />\nor two classes.<br />\nAt the higher levels, these<br />\nproblems of attitude translate<br />\ninto very real restrictions. Jeanette, a medical student, points<br />\nout that interning involves highly irregular attitudes with little<br />\nsleep and little free time to<br />\nspend at home.<br />\nStudents<br />\nwithout family respoinsibilities<br />\nmay grow accustomed to that<br />\nschedule; however, a woman<br />\nwith young children and no<br />\navailable child care would find it<br />\nimpossible.<br />\nCamille majors in Interna<br />\ntional Studies and her main<br />\ncomplaint with the Hopkins faculty is that there aren't enough<br />\nwomen on it. Role models can<br />\ngreatly affect a student's career,<br />\nand Camille has found it difficult, though not impossible, to<br />\nobtain the guidance she needs.<br />\nShe has deliberately sought out<br />\nwomen professors, and has<br />\nfound their help, both professional and personal, essential to<br />\nher education and survival at<br />\nHopkins. None of these professors, however, have been in the<br />\nfield of International Studies.<br />\nchanged her major because she<br />\nfelt \"very intimidated by science<br />\n<br />\nclasses\" and found herself in the<br />\nmidst of \"a male competitive<br />\natmosphere.\" Ann decided that<br />\nDr. Emily Martin (her real<br />\nname), professor of anthropology, proves by example that<br />\nstudents benefit from having<br />\nwomen as professors. \"There is<br />\na general assumption in society<br />\nthat women are not as intellectually proficient [as men],\" she<br />\nsays. Dr. Martin has had students refer to her as a \"lady<br />\nprofessor,\" while students do<br />\nnot find that kind of gender<br />\nclarification necessary when referring to male professors.<br />\nPart of the problem for<br />\nwomen in universities, Dr. Martin points out, is that women<br />\nhave been socialized to learn a<br />\ndifferent form of language. This<br />\nlanguage involves more sentence<br />\ntags (e.g., \"We'll go to the<br />\nmovie, okay?\"), a more aesthetically descriptive vocabulary,and<br />\nmore emotional, less direct<br />\nforms of argument. (Robin<br />\nLakoff, an anthropologist, has<br />\nwritten extensively on this subject.) \"Women's language conveys a lack of sureness,\" according to Dr. Martin. \"As a result,<br />\nwomen sound less clear, less<br />\nconfident. This is very damaging<br />\nin academia.\"<br />\nShe believes most sex discrimination in the classroom<br />\ntakes a very subtle form.<br />\n\"Put-downs, patronizing remarks, and sexist wisecracks are<br />\nexamples of the professor's<br />\nreluctance to take what a<br />\nwoman says seriously. Students<br />\nmust call attention to it and stop<br />\nsubtle subordination in its<br />\ntracks.\"<br />\nDr. Martin, like Camille,<br />\n<br />\nfeels that the University should<br />\nwork toward getting more women on the faculty and as<br />\nstudents. She urges students to<br />\npoint out the lack they feel.<br />\n\"When the government ceases to<br />\nstand behind social reforms,\"<br />\nshe says,\"it is easy for people to<br />\nslip back.\"<br />\nAfter a little thought, each<br />\nwoman interviewed had some<br />\ncomplaint, no matter how small,<br />\nabout her experience at HopYet few would view<br />\nkins.<br />\nparticular incidents as indications of deeper problems in the<br />\nsocial structure of this or any<br />\nuniversity, or in society as a<br />\nwhole. Among those who did<br />\nmake a connection, few had any<br />\ndesire to work toward social<br />\nchange. In response to these<br />\nfindings, Dr. Martin concludes,<br />\n\"If you have already committed<br />\nyourself to a career in this<br />\nsystem, you will be much less<br />\nlikely to examine and criticize<br />\nyour role in it.\"<br />\nAlthough change will not<br />\ncome about simply from discussion, it is vital that women learn<br />\nthey are not alone in their<br />\nexperiences. Women must learn<br />\nto stop internalizing discrimination, and learn to identify those<br />\nincidents that truly are the result<br />\nof a larger problem. \"Until we<br />\ncan change society,\" Dr. Martin<br />\nbelieves, \"the best form of help<br />\nis to meet other people with the<br />\nsame problem.\" That means<br />\norganize.<br />\n<br />\nLaura Rosenthal, a junior, is<br />\nPresident of the M.

Indeed, if a single American city is lost to a<br />\nnuclear detonation\u2014whether we win the war or not \u2014<br />\nhave we not in fact lost?

E. Fitzgerald, a Pentagon cost controller, was<br />\nappalled to see defense programs quadrupled in price in<br />\ntwo years as the product's quality declined. He estimated defense contractor efficiency to be around 10-20<br />\npercent compared to about 70 percent in the civilian<br />\nmarket. In the May 1981 Proceedings: U.S. Naval<br />\nInstitute it was shown that the Navy could cancel its<br />\nF-18 fighter program (800 jets for $30 billion) and<br />\nafter purchasing an equal number of older but capable<br />\nfighters, save $8 billion. The cost of the new B-1 bomber is approaching half a billion dollars for each single<br />\naircraft. The Pentagon found that its own videotape<br />\nrecorders, diesel generators, vehicles and shipboard tape<br />\nrecorders cost 3,4,4,and 48 times more dollars respectively that comparable civilian products. It is probable<br />\nthat most weapons systems are similarly overpriced.

This problem is not<br />\nhelped by the bogus art history found<br />\neverywhere which is simply terrible.<br />\nThe show begins with a room full of<br />\na large photograph of<br />\nreproductions:<br />\nAssisi, a series of photo reproductions of<br />\nfrescoes illustrating the most banal of<br />\nprogressions from early Italians to Cimabue to Giotto, and a replica of the<br />\nByzantine crucifix which first moved<br />\nFrancis. There are more, with commentary; it all seemed as if an art history<br />\nbook had been cut to pieces and pastea<br />\non the walls. The next room, which is<br />\nvery poorly lit, contains the Assisi Missal<br />\n(which may have inspired Francis) and a<br />\nlarge crucifix from the school of Florence, circa 1280. These are very nice,<br />\nespecially if one could see them better.<br />\nThe third room is full of paintings, books<br />\nand other beautiful objects. For me,the<br />\n<br />\npaintings are not the main attraction I<br />\ndon't think they are really very good,<br />\nalthough there is a beautiful altarpiece of<br />\nMadonna and Child with Saints by Pacino<br />\ndi Bonaguida (active 1303 or 1320-39),<br />\nwhich portrays Francis wih Saints Nicholas and Lawrence and the Apostle<br />\nJames.

That's where New Jersey<br />\ncomes in. The Garden State's main<br />\nattraction is its southern Atlantic shore\u2014<br />\neasily accessible to the Hopkins student-and specifically, a little place known as<br />\nAtlantic City. No longer does that name<br />\nimmediately bring to mind the Boardwalk, that famous stretch of lumber that<br />\nput Atlantic City on the map.

Atlantic City has<br />\nbecome a boom town of sorts.<br />\nBy taking the Beltway east to the<br />\nJFK-Delaware-New Jersey Turnpike Exit<br />\n3 (Route 40) you can reach the new La.<br />\nVegas in three hours. Route 40 is something of a country road that pretends to<br />\nbe a highway in a few spots and will let<br />\nyou hit a cruising speed of 50 mph if you<br />\ndon't get stuck behind a truck.

Big name Vegas stars show<br />\nup--David Brenner, Lola Falana, Marilyn<br />\nMcCoo (minus Billy Davis, Jr.), and, of<br />\ncourse, Sinatra. There are also house<br />\nrevues such as \"Outrageous\" at Bally's<br />\nPark Place (a show to be missed. The<br />\nonly thing outrageous was the price of<br />\nthe drinks\u2014minimum two drinks per<br />\nperson at five bucks a hit). Local entertainment may also be found, although<br />\nnot always in the large casino-hotels.<br />\nDinner for two may cost $100, and<br />\n\"cheap\" rooms are $65 a night, out of<br />\nseason.

Most are on the Boardwalk or a<br />\nblock up from it with easily accessible<br />\nparking. If you can afford it, a room at<br />\none of these places is a good idea. Not<br />\nonly is everything you need often under<br />\none roof, but the luxury accomodations<br />\nare quite a switch from university housing. With most casinos open from 10<br />\na.m. to 6 a.m. on weekends, one of the<br />\nbest ways to avoid the expense of a hotel<br />\nroom is to go in the morning and stay<br />\nuntil they close. There are always hotel<br />\nlobbies to sack out in, and as long as<br />\nyou're dressed well enough, there shouldn't be a problem.<br />\nAnother possibility is to rent a<br />\nroom in a motel outside the city.

Dzura<br /><br />\nRock Ban Elitism<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nTo flaunt your riches, so<br />\nthey say, has become acceptable<br />\nonce again. And so has snobbery. One institution in Baltimore that has led this trend is<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nA few months ago, the<br />\nstudent council of JHU banned<br />\nall rock music from the annual<br /><br />\nSpring Fair held at Hopkins'<br />\nHomewood Campus. After a<br />\nsmall but persistent outcry by<br />\nsome students, a councilimposed -compromise\" was imposed to severely restrict all<br />\npopular music and limit it to<br />\nisolated areas.<br />\nThe student<br />\ncouncil and school administration claimed that the reasoning<br />\nbehind the decision was security,<br />\nbut an investigation reveals a<br />\nmuch stronger strain of antiBaltimore elitism. Statements<br />\ntaken from the Hopkins' NewsLetter on this issue are quite<br />\nrevealing.<br />\nIn reference to the ban:<br />\n\"The controversy stems from<br />\nthe - presence of unwelcome<br />\nindividuals on campus due to the<br />\nfair, people who bring their own<br />\nbeer and food. . .These 'undesirables' allegedly camp out on the<br />\nlawn contributing little to the<br />\nfestival.\"<br />\nPerhaps the word<br />\n\"money\" should be inserted<br />\nbetween the words \"little\" and<br />\n\"to\".<br />\nWho are these \"undesirables\"? The News-Letter reports:<br />\n\"Security [Hopkins' police]<br />\nfeels confident that the greatest<br />\npercentage of all acts of vandalism are caused by non-students.\"<br />\nCitizens of the surrounding<br />\ncommunity were first \"undesirables\", and now they are<br />\n\"vandals\".<br />\nSignificantly, no<br />\nfacts and no proof has been<br />\npresented to back up security's<br /><br />\nclaims - their actions are based<br />\nsolely on assumptions.<br />\nOne of the directors of the<br />\n1981 Spring Fair then declared,<br />\n\"If we give them [the \"undesirables\"] any rock music at all,<br />\nthey'll hang out and hope for<br />\nmore. . .Students can appreciate<br />\ndiversity. Let's bore the nonstudents to death with culture.\"<br />\nThis statement reflects an all too<br />\ncommon attitude on Hopkins<br />\ncampus that the working people<br />\nof the surrounding community<br />\nare somehow inferior and have<br />\nno right to even come onto the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe attempted ban and<br />\ncontinued limitation on rock<br />\nmusic perpetuates this kind of<br />\nignorant elitism.

The male/female ratio strikes her as a<br />\nproblem: \"You can walk down<br />\nthe hallway all the way around<br />\nGilman and not see a single<br />\nwoman. . it [the ratio] doesn't<br />\naffect me so much that 1 think<br />\nabout it all the time, but it does<br />\naffect me enough to think about<br />\nit.\" Joan feels she has been<br />\ntreated fairly here; in fact she<br />\nfeels sometimes she had been<br />\ntreated more than fairly. She is<br />\nsure she got into a playwriting<br />\nclass only because they needed<br />\nmore women. She also believes<br />\nthis is why she was admitted to<br />\nHopkins: \"I'm sure I wouldn't<br />\nhave gotten in here if I were a<br />\nguy.\"<br />\nContrary to her belief, the<br />\nAdmission Office does not lower<br />\nits objective standards for women; it accepts a percentage of<br />\nwomen proportional to the<br />\npercentage who apply. But<br />\nwhen Joan learned of the<br />\nmale/female ratio, she assumed<br />\nshe was admitted because of her<br />\nsex. Her choice of interpretation - that she was admitted<br />\nbecause of her sex and not<br />\nbecause of her intellectual qualifications - reflects the larger<br />\nattitudes of a sexist society. Her<br />\nchoice exemplifies the same<br />\nproblem found in the Golberg<br />\nstudy - she has been taught to<br /><br />\ndevalue her own work.<br />\nAnother student, Beth, is a<br />\nsocial science major doing an<br />\nindependent study in the humanities. Her professor has been<br />\nencouraging about her work, but<br />\nshe says, \"I don't know whether<br />\nhe likes my work or just thinks<br />\nI'm cute.\" She feels that he<br />\nvalues their friendship but does<br />\nnot accept her as a colleague.<br />\nShe believes he would not flatter<br />\nher work as much if he were not<br />\npersonally attracted to her.<br />\nBecause his criticism is not harsh<br />\n'enough, Beth feels she has not<br />\nmade the kinds of improvements<br />\nshe could have. Her observations could be correct, and if<br />\nthey are, the professor is not<br />\ntaking her education as seriously as he should. On the other<br />\nhand, her work could truly<br />\nwarrant his compliments. But<br />\ninstead of attributing her success<br />\nto her talent, Beth has chosen to<br />\nattribute it to her attractiveness,<br />\nand thus undersells her own<br />\nintellectual capabilities. If Beth<br />\nis not simply insecure about her<br />\ntalent, this example shows how<br />\nshe has learned to view men's<br />\nperceptions of women.<br />\nOne housemaster interviewed said that it seemed to her<br />\nthat more women have dropped<br />\nout of the science majors than<br />\nmen. She feels this may be<br />\npartly due to advisors being all<br />\ntoo willing to encourage women<br />\nto switch majors when they run<br />\ninto difficulties. Ann, a former<br />\nscience major, found her classes<br />\ndifficult, as most Hopkins students do. However, she says she<br />\nshe did not have the competitive<br />\ndrive she needed to keep up,and<br />\nattributes this to her early<br /><br />\neducation. She believes women<br />\nare taught not to sacrifice<br />\npersonal relationships for achievement.<br />\n\"Relationships are equally<br />\nimportant as school for women,\" she says. \"This makes<br />\nthings more difficult for a<br />\nwoman in a high-powered field<br />\nbecause she has to make<br />\nchoices.\" Ann's opinions reflect<br />\ndeeply rooted societal problems<br />\nthat cannot be merely attributed<br />\nto the atmosphere created in one<br />\nor two classes.<br />\nAt the higher levels, these<br />\nproblems of attitude translate<br />\ninto very real restrictions. Jeanette, a medical student, points<br />\nout that interning involves highly irregular attitudes with little<br />\nsleep and little free time to<br />\nspend at home.<br />\nStudents<br />\nwithout family respoinsibilities<br />\nmay grow accustomed to that<br />\nschedule; however, a woman<br />\nwith young children and no<br />\navailable child care would find it<br />\nimpossible.<br />\nCamille majors in Interna<br />\ntional Studies and her main<br />\ncomplaint with the Hopkins faculty is that there aren't enough<br />\nwomen on it. Role models can<br />\ngreatly affect a student's career,<br />\nand Camille has found it difficult, though not impossible, to<br />\nobtain the guidance she needs.<br />\nShe has deliberately sought out<br />\nwomen professors, and has<br />\nfound their help, both professional and personal, essential to<br />\nher education and survival at<br />\nHopkins. None of these professors, however, have been in the<br />\nfield of International Studies.<br />\nchanged her major because she<br />\nfelt \"very intimidated by science<br /><br />\nclasses\" and found herself in the<br />\nmidst of \"a male competitive<br />\natmosphere.\" Ann decided that<br />\nDr. Emily Martin (her real<br />\nname), professor of anthropology, proves by example that<br />\nstudents benefit from having<br />\nwomen as professors. \"There is<br />\na general assumption in society<br />\nthat women are not as intellectually proficient [as men],\" she<br />\nsays. Dr. Martin has had students refer to her as a \"lady<br />\nprofessor,\" while students do<br />\nnot find that kind of gender<br />\nclarification necessary when referring to male professors.<br />\nPart of the problem for<br />\nwomen in universities, Dr. Martin points out, is that women<br />\nhave been socialized to learn a<br />\ndifferent form of language. This<br />\nlanguage involves more sentence<br />\ntags (e.g., \"We'll go to the<br />\nmovie, okay?\"), a more aesthetically descriptive vocabulary,and<br />\nmore emotional, less direct<br />\nforms of argument. (Robin<br />\nLakoff, an anthropologist, has<br />\nwritten extensively on this subject.) \"Women's language conveys a lack of sureness,\" according to Dr. Martin. \"As a result,<br />\nwomen sound less clear, less<br />\nconfident. This is very damaging<br />\nin academia.\"<br />\nShe believes most sex discrimination in the classroom<br />\ntakes a very subtle form.<br />\n\"Put-downs, patronizing remarks, and sexist wisecracks are<br />\nexamples of the professor's<br />\nreluctance to take what a<br />\nwoman says seriously. Students<br />\nmust call attention to it and stop<br />\nsubtle subordination in its<br />\ntracks.\"<br />\nDr. Martin, like Camille,<br /><br />\nfeels that the University should<br />\nwork toward getting more women on the faculty and as<br />\nstudents. She urges students to<br />\npoint out the lack they feel.<br />\n\"When the government ceases to<br />\nstand behind social reforms,\"<br />\nshe says,\"it is easy for people to<br />\nslip back.\"<br />\nAfter a little thought, each<br />\nwoman interviewed had some<br />\ncomplaint, no matter how small,<br />\nabout her experience at HopYet few would view<br />\nkins.<br />\nparticular incidents as indications of deeper problems in the<br />\nsocial structure of this or any<br />\nuniversity, or in society as a<br />\nwhole. Among those who did<br />\nmake a connection, few had any<br />\ndesire to work toward social<br />\nchange. In response to these<br />\nfindings, Dr. Martin concludes,<br />\n\"If you have already committed<br />\nyourself to a career in this<br />\nsystem, you will be much less<br />\nlikely to examine and criticize<br />\nyour role in it.\"<br />\nAlthough change will not<br />\ncome about simply from discussion, it is vital that women learn<br />\nthey are not alone in their<br />\nexperiences. Women must learn<br />\nto stop internalizing discrimination, and learn to identify those<br />\nincidents that truly are the result<br />\nof a larger problem. \"Until we<br />\ncan change society,\" Dr. Martin<br />\nbelieves, \"the best form of help<br />\nis to meet other people with the<br />\nsame problem.\" That means<br />\norganize.<br /><br />\nLaura Rosenthal, a junior, is<br />\nPresident of the M.

E. Fitzgerald, a Pentagon cost controller, was<br />\nappalled to see defense programs quadrupled in price in<br />\ntwo years as the product's quality declined. He estimated defense contractor efficiency to be around 10-20<br />\npercent compared to about 70 percent in the civilian<br />\nmarket. In the May 1981 Proceedings: U.S. Naval<br />\nInstitute it was shown that the Navy could cancel its<br />\nF-18 fighter program (800 jets for $30 billion) and<br />\nafter purchasing an equal number of older but capable<br />\nfighters, save $8 billion. The cost of the new B-1 bomber is approaching half a billion dollars for each single<br />\naircraft. The Pentagon found that its own videotape<br />\nrecorders, diesel generators, vehicles and shipboard tape<br />\nrecorders cost 3,4,4,and 48 times more dollars respectively that comparable civilian products. It is probable<br />\nthat most weapons systems are similarly overpriced.

As befits what are the<br />\ntop two college teams in the<br />\nnation, both went right down to<br />\nthe wire. The Tar Heels took<br />\nround one, 14-13, in last year's<br />\nNCAA championship. With the<br />\nBlue Jays on the verge of avenging that defeat, the Tar Heels<br />\nfoiled Henry Ciccarone's strategy and stole off with a 13-12<br />\novertime victory.<br />\nUndoubtedly there was<br />\nquite a bit of second-guessing of<br />\nCiccarone's slowdown offense<br />\nwith a 12-10 lead and about six<br />\nminutes remaining to be played<br />\nbut not by Ciccarone himself.<br />\n\"It was the right decision,\"<br />\nhe said. \"We've won every game<br />\nwe've ever used it in.\"<br />\nUntil this one.
