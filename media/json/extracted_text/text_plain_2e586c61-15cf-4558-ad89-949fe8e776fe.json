You have a test in<br />\nGarland Hall at ten. Madly<br />\ndriving through the parking lot<br />\nnear the practice field, you<br />\ndiscover, as usual, that all parking<br />\nSpaces in the lot have already<br />\nbeen filled.<br />\nLogic would dictate traveling<br />\nto the lower lot near Wyman<br />\nPark Drive. But on this Monday<br />\nmorning of mid-term<br />\nexaminations, these spaces are<br />\nalso filled. Thus, at 10:03, you<br />\nare forced to consider Charles<br />\nVillage, St. Paul St., or University<br />\nPkwy for prospective spots,<br />\nalthough this will mean an<br />\nadditional five minutes. Finally<br />\nfinding a precious plot on St.<br />\nPaul St., you arrive in class,<br />\nsweating and exasperated, at<br />\n10:15.<br />\n<br />\nOn-campus parking, free for<br />\nstudents, faculty members, and<br />\nUniversity employees, is highly<br />\ncompetitive, especially for those<br />\nwho don't arrive until 10:00 a.m.<br />\nOf course if one arrives before<br />\n9:00 there is little problem.<br />\nWilliam Campbell, Director of<br />\nPlan-operations, said 1077 total<br />\nparking spaces are available on<br />\ncampus, for those who possess<br />\npermits. Permits are issued to<br />\nthose living outside a 34mile<br />\nradius of campus, a limit of two<br />\ncars per person. Of the 1077, 79<br />\nare metered spaces, 247 are<br />\nfaculty spaces (type 1) and 751<br />\nare for students and university<br />\nemployees (type 2). Over half of<br />\nthe total parking spaces(564)are<br />\nlocated in the large parking lots<br />\nnear the practice field.<br />\nIn comparison to the number<br />\nof parking spaces available, the<br />\nnumber of parking permits issued<br />\n<br />\nAsked whether expp*e can be<br />\njustified for mcfrez.. parking.<br />\nSouthwick said,\"I think it would<br />\nwarrant moderate expense.\"<br />\nHowever, Southwick added he<br />\nspoke with Dr. Benton a couple<br />\nof years ago and funds weren't<br />\n,<br />\nminflnhle.<br />\nClark, 2nd<br />\ndistrict<br />\nPat<br />\nCouncilwoman, said she has<br />\nreceived numerous complaints<br />\nfrom residents of Charles Village,<br />\nUniversity Pkwy and the<br />\nOkanshaw neighborhood.<br />\nClark suggests students<br />\n\"should be discouraged\" from<br />\nhaving cars. \"This could go a long<br />\nway to helping us all.\"<br />\nHowever, a number of sources<br />\nsaid restrictions or discouraging<br />\nmeasures by the University<br />\nwould probably cause widespread<br />\ndiscontent among effected<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAsked whether additional<br />\n<br />\nLETTER<br />\n<br />\nMAN OF THE WEEK<br />\nLarry Frelow, who takes<br />\nover as housing director.<br />\n<br />\nis far greater; 726 type 1 permits<br />\nand 2192 type 2. Although the<br />\npermits issued represents a<br />\ndisproportionate number to<br />\nspaces available, Betty Murdock,<br />\nassistant to George Benton,<br />\nVice-Pres. of Homewood<br />\nDivisions, cautioned that over<br />\n50% of the permits go to persons<br />\nwith more than one car.<br />\nTherefore, only half of the<br />\npermits issued are actually used<br />\neach day. Still, the figures suggest<br />\nwhy the daily parking hassles<br />\nexist.<br />\n'Either additional parking<br />\nfacilities, should be constructed,<br />\nor further restrictions should be<br />\nimposed on permit holders,<br />\nsuggest various sources.<br />\n. Both Gary Levine and Steve<br />\nSouthwick, Hopkins students and<br />\nformer members of the<br />\ncommuter committee, believe<br />\nadditional facilities are needed.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\nli<br />\n141E giWS<br />\n<br />\nGo get 'em Lar.<br />\n<br />\nvol. lxxxi, no. 11/tuesday, october 12, 1976/baltimore, maryland/81st year<br />\n<br />\non-campus parking facilities was<br />\na good idea, Clark said this would<br />\nencourage more students to<br />\ndrive, and thus could cqqpound<br />\nthe problem.<br />\nHowever, a number of sonrces<br />\nadvocated an annual parking fee<br />\nto pay for the construction of<br />\nnew parking facilities, or to<br />\niiscourage driving to school. This<br />\nplan could backfire if drivers<br />\n.eact by parking even more off<br />\ncampus. Others, including<br />\nHopkins President.

The committee<br />\ncharged with Frelow's selection<br />\nwas headed by Dean of Students<br />\nJakie Hall, and included several<br />\n<br />\nstudents, including Student<br />\n\u201eCouncil President Steve Ponchak.<br />\nHall said that Frelow comes to<br />\nthe housing post highly<br />\n_recommended and that both he<br />\nand the committee were very<br />\nimpressed by the strong interest<br />\nin young people which they feel<br />\nFrelow possesses. \"lie perceives<br />\nstudents as equals, he has good<br />\nbusiness sense, and he also has a<br />\nstrong management<br />\nbackground,\" the Dean said.<br />\nThe new housing director<br />\nasserted that considerable<br />\nemphasis will be placed on the<br />\nneed to incorporate student<br />\ninput into the policy-making<br />\n<br />\ndecisions of his office. He<br />\ncommented, \"We will have alot<br />\nof student input. I will always<br />\nremember that the housing<br />\noffice's main emphasis is to<br />\nprovide a service to students, as<br />\nwell as to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.\" Frelow sees the<br />\nlargest portion of this input to<br />\ncome through dealings with the<br />\nstudent council.<br />\nThe new director, who got his<br />\nstart in student housing while<br />\nserving as a student assistant<br />\nhousing director at Southern<br />\nUniversity in Baton Rouge,<br />\nLouisiana, contrasted the setting<br />\nfor student housing here with<br />\n<br />\nthat at the University of<br />\nMaryland: \"At Maryland the<br />\nliving student body is seven times<br />\nthe size of the housing program<br />\nhere. The major difference, in<br />\naddition to the size of the<br />\nhousing programs, is the<br />\napartment style of living offered<br />\nto upper classmen at Hopkins.<br />\nFrelow said that he has already<br />\nbeen briefed on the problems<br />\nwhich the University has<br />\nencountered in its dealings with<br />\nthe community in the student<br />\nhousing area.

Another reason is<br />\nHarrington's recently published<br />\ncritically-acclaimed book, The<br />\nTwilight of Capitalism.<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Matthew A.

These gusts made passing<br />\nnearly impossible and nullified<br />\nany semblance of a kicking game<br />\non the part of either team.<br />\nAs a result, strategies had to be<br />\ndrastically readjusted as the<br />\ncontest progressed. According to<br />\nHopkins Head Coach Dennis<br />\nCox, the Jays (now 1-2 for the<br />\nyear) had hoped to put the ball<br />\ninto the air at least thirty times<br />\nbut, because of the winds, were<br />\nforced to resort to a ground<br />\n<br />\nattack and attempted only<br />\nfourteen aerials.<br />\nAlthough neither team was<br />\nable to score in the first half, it<br />\nwas rarely this climatic adversary<br />\nthat was the major cause. Rather,<br />\nit was an old and more familiar<br />\nproblem -turnovers -that kept<br />\nthe game at 0-0 after two<br />\nquarters.<br />\nNo less than seven fumbles and<br />\ninterceptions were recorded by<br />\nboth teams through the first<br />\nthirty minutes of play, bringing<br />\npossible scoring drives to<br />\nscreeching halts.<br />\nThe best opportunity to get<br />\nonto the scoreboard came just<br />\nseconds before the end of the<br />\nhalf. The Bears intercepted a<br />\nBlue Jay pass and returned the<br />\nball to the JHU eight yard line.<br />\nHowever, the Hopkins defense<br />\nstrengthened and a short field<br />\ngoal attempt on the fourth down<br />\nwas unsuccessful when the snap<br />\n<br />\nwas fumbled.<br />\nThe Jays scored what proved<br />\nto be the winning points midway<br />\nthrough the third quarter. Under<br />\nthe direction of quarterback Bob<br />\nGeist, Hopkins moved on the<br />\nground to a first down at the<br />\nUrsinus fifteen.<br />\nOn a third down and five<br />\nsituation, Geist spotted tight end<br />\nMike Rhodey over the middle<br />\nand rifled a pass to the senior<br />\ntri-captain. Without breaking<br />\nstride, Rhodey gathered in the<br />\npass and rambled untouched into<br />\nthe end zone for a 6-0 Hopkins<br />\nlead. Moments later, Geist<br />\nincreased that lead to 8-0 as he<br />\nrolled around right end for the<br />\ntwo-point conversion.<br />\nThe home team closed the gap<br />\nto 8-3 in the fourth quarter.<br />\nBeginning at their own<br />\nforty-four \u2022, the Bears drove to a<br />\nfirst down at the Blue Jays<br />\nfifteen but could go no farther.<br />\n<br />\nOn fourth down, a field goal<br />\nattempt was good-the first such<br />\nsuccessful try following three<br />\nprevious failures.<br />\nUrsinus had one last gasp<br />\nremaining. With onlytwo minutes.<br />\nremaining in the game, the Bears<br />\ngot the ball near midfield and<br />\nstarted to move. However a<br />\nfourth down pass at the Blue Jay<br />\nthirty-five fell incomplete and<br />\nHopkins had its first win of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nCoach Cox was obviously<br />\npleased with the results of the<br />\ncontest.<br />\n\"The first win is always the<br />\nhardest,\" he commented. \"I was<br />\nvery pleased with our effort.<br />\nWe've been involved in some<br />\ntough games and some teams<br />\nwould have folded-I think this<br />\nshows alot of character.\"<br />\n\"Our defense won the game<br />\nfor us,\" the Blue Jay mentor<br />\ncontinued. \"They did a great<br />\n<br />\njob-especially when you realize<br />\nhow long they were out there.\"<br />\nThe Coach also cited the<br />\nefforts of Geist, the reserve<br />\nquarterback. According to Cox,<br />\nthe team wasn't moving under<br />\nstarter Torn Bender, \"so<br />\ndecided to give Bob an<br />\nopportunity and he was a big<br />\nspark for us.\"<br />\nThe number of turnovers,<br />\nhowever, was disappointing to<br />\nthe Coach.<br />\n\"Two fumbles and two<br />\ninterceptions are too manY<br />\nmistakes,\" he explained. \"We<br />\nhave to work to eliminate the<br />\nteam-especiallY<br />\noffensive -mistakes.\"<br />\nThe Jays will try to even their<br />\nrecord this Saturday at home<br />\nagainst Salisbury State.

In May, the<br />\ndormitory and the fraternity<br />\nwhose teams have amassed the<br />\nhighest total of points are<br />\nawarded the BIA trophies.<br />\nThe first sport organized this<br />\nyear was Flag Football, which<br />\ngot underway Sept. 20. It has<br />\n<br />\nbeen difficult to schedule games<br />\naround all the rain that has<br />\noccurred recently, but after five<br />\ngames, perennial powers Du and<br />\nWilson-Wood are leading the frat<br />\nand dorm leagues respectively<br />\nwith perfect records.<br />\nA surprising trend in recent<br />\nyears is the increase in number<br />\nand ability of the independent<br />\nteams entering BIA tournaments.<br />\nThis year is no exception, as the<br />\nPackers and the Black Student<br />\nUnion currently hold third and<br />\nfourth places in the independent<br />\ndivision.<br />\nTwo of the \"minor sports\"<br />\nhave already been held.

You have a test in<br />\nGarland Hall at ten. Madly<br />\ndriving through the parking lot<br />\nnear the practice field, you<br />\ndiscover, as usual, that all parking<br />\nSpaces in the lot have already<br />\nbeen filled.<br />\nLogic would dictate traveling<br />\nto the lower lot near Wyman<br />\nPark Drive. But on this Monday<br />\nmorning of mid-term<br />\nexaminations, these spaces are<br />\nalso filled. Thus, at 10:03, you<br />\nare forced to consider Charles<br />\nVillage, St. Paul St., or University<br />\nPkwy for prospective spots,<br />\nalthough this will mean an<br />\nadditional five minutes. Finally<br />\nfinding a precious plot on St.<br />\nPaul St., you arrive in class,<br />\nsweating and exasperated, at<br />\n10:15.<br /><br />\nOn-campus parking, free for<br />\nstudents, faculty members, and<br />\nUniversity employees, is highly<br />\ncompetitive, especially for those<br />\nwho don't arrive until 10:00 a.m.<br />\nOf course if one arrives before<br />\n9:00 there is little problem.<br />\nWilliam Campbell, Director of<br />\nPlan-operations, said 1077 total<br />\nparking spaces are available on<br />\ncampus, for those who possess<br />\npermits. Permits are issued to<br />\nthose living outside a 34mile<br />\nradius of campus, a limit of two<br />\ncars per person. Of the 1077, 79<br />\nare metered spaces, 247 are<br />\nfaculty spaces (type 1) and 751<br />\nare for students and university<br />\nemployees (type 2). Over half of<br />\nthe total parking spaces(564)are<br />\nlocated in the large parking lots<br />\nnear the practice field.<br />\nIn comparison to the number<br />\nof parking spaces available, the<br />\nnumber of parking permits issued<br /><br />\nAsked whether expp*e can be<br />\njustified for mcfrez.. parking.<br />\nSouthwick said,\"I think it would<br />\nwarrant moderate expense.\"<br />\nHowever, Southwick added he<br />\nspoke with Dr. Benton a couple<br />\nof years ago and funds weren't<br />\n,<br />\nminflnhle.<br />\nClark, 2nd<br />\ndistrict<br />\nPat<br />\nCouncilwoman, said she has<br />\nreceived numerous complaints<br />\nfrom residents of Charles Village,<br />\nUniversity Pkwy and the<br />\nOkanshaw neighborhood.<br />\nClark suggests students<br />\n\"should be discouraged\" from<br />\nhaving cars. \"This could go a long<br />\nway to helping us all.\"<br />\nHowever, a number of sources<br />\nsaid restrictions or discouraging<br />\nmeasures by the University<br />\nwould probably cause widespread<br />\ndiscontent among effected<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAsked whether additional<br /><br />\nLETTER<br /><br />\nMAN OF THE WEEK<br />\nLarry Frelow, who takes<br />\nover as housing director.<br /><br />\nis far greater; 726 type 1 permits<br />\nand 2192 type 2. Although the<br />\npermits issued represents a<br />\ndisproportionate number to<br />\nspaces available, Betty Murdock,<br />\nassistant to George Benton,<br />\nVice-Pres. of Homewood<br />\nDivisions, cautioned that over<br />\n50% of the permits go to persons<br />\nwith more than one car.<br />\nTherefore, only half of the<br />\npermits issued are actually used<br />\neach day. Still, the figures suggest<br />\nwhy the daily parking hassles<br />\nexist.<br />\n'Either additional parking<br />\nfacilities, should be constructed,<br />\nor further restrictions should be<br />\nimposed on permit holders,<br />\nsuggest various sources.<br />\n. Both Gary Levine and Steve<br />\nSouthwick, Hopkins students and<br />\nformer members of the<br />\ncommuter committee, believe<br />\nadditional facilities are needed.<br /><br />\n\u2014<br />\nli<br />\n141E giWS<br /><br />\nGo get 'em Lar.<br /><br />\nvol. lxxxi, no. 11/tuesday, october 12, 1976/baltimore, maryland/81st year<br /><br />\non-campus parking facilities was<br />\na good idea, Clark said this would<br />\nencourage more students to<br />\ndrive, and thus could cqqpound<br />\nthe problem.<br />\nHowever, a number of sonrces<br />\nadvocated an annual parking fee<br />\nto pay for the construction of<br />\nnew parking facilities, or to<br />\niiscourage driving to school. This<br />\nplan could backfire if drivers<br />\n.eact by parking even more off<br />\ncampus. Others, including<br />\nHopkins President.

As such,<br />\nthey are forced to develop<br />\nextensive ancillary staffs to deal<br />\nalmost exclusively with the<br />\nnon-academic or business side of<br />\noperating an 'academic<br />\ncorporation.'<br />\nA vital concern of any<br />\ncorporation's administration is a<br />\nsound legal support staff, and it<br />\nwas in recognition of this need<br />\nthat the Board of Trustees<br />\nestablished the position of<br />\nGeneral Counsel of the<br />\nUniversity last Au ust<br /><br />\nFrom its inception, the post<br />\nhas been held by Estelle A.<br />\nFishbein, former Special<br />\nAssistant Attorney General for<br />\nthe University of Maryland and a<br />\nspecialist in university law.<br />\nIn a recent interview, Fishbein<br />\ncommented on the contemporary<br />\n'university-as-corporation.' \"The<br />\nuniversity is a large corporation,<br />\nand has all of the commercial<br />\nproblems a corporation has. But<br />\nit is a unique organization in that<br />\nit has academic rather than<br />\ncommercial values\u2014a system of<br />\nethics prevails.\"<br />\nFishbein explained that in her<br />\ncapacity as University attorney,<br />\nshe handles a multitude of<br />\nroblems and responsibilities,_<br /><br />\nranging from campus labor<br />\nagreements to keeping abreast of<br />\nnew statutes and regulations<br />\nwhich have an impact on<br />\nuniversity operation. Having<br />\nserved for three years as a Senior<br />\nStaff Attorney for the<br />\nDepartment of Health,<br />\nEducation, and Welfare .(HEW),<br />\nFishbein is well acquainted with<br />\nthe intricacies of college- and<br />\nuniversity law, and with the<br />\ncontroversial issue of federal<br />\ncontrols on higher education, in<br />\nparticular. The federal<br />\ngovernment (through HEW)<br />\nimposes admissions quotas and<br />\ncurriculum guidelines on colleges,<br />\nas a prerequisite for federal<br />\nfunding.<br /><br />\nCorantion<br />\nContending that, \"the federal<br />\nintrusion into academics\" had<br />\n\"serious First Amendment<br />\nimplications,\" Fishbein pointed<br />\nout that \"the faculty of a school<br />\nis best qualified to determine the<br />\nacademic policy of that school.\"<br />\nFishbein claimed that<br />\nbureaucrats who are neither<br />\nqualified by education or<br />\nexperience, should not \"tell<br />\nschools what courses to teach, or<br />\nwho to teach them to.\"<br />\nAcknowledgement<br />\nHowever, Fishbein<br />\nthat \"HEW<br />\nacknowledges<br /><br />\nperforms an important auditing<br />\nfunction, in seeking out and<br />\npreventing fraud and<br />\nmisappropriation of federal<br />\nfunds.\"<br />\nGraduate<br />\nA graduate of Yale Law<br />\nSchool, Fishbein described her<br />\npersonal ideal for attorney-client<br />\nrelationships as \"preventive law.\"<br />\n\"Law suits are not pleasant<br />\nthings, and I feel that the greatest<br />\nservice an attorney can perform<br />\nfor a client, is to keep him out of<br />\ncourt.\"<br />\nFishbein is aided by Assistant<br />\nGeneral Counsel of the<br />\nUniversity, Frederick DeKuyper.<br /><br />\nGround broken for Mudd buikling<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nGroundb reaking \u2022 ceremonies<br />\nwere held yesterday in Dunning<br />\nPark for the new biology building<br />\nplanned for .that site.<br />\nConStfuction of this building<br />\nmarks the start of the new<br />\nHopkins biology complex which<br />\nwill include three buildings upon<br />\ncompletion.<br />\nFunds for the premier<br />\nstructure, which has an estimated<br />\ncost of around $5 million, will<br />\ncome mainly from a $1.5 million<br />\ncontribution the University<br />\nreceived from the Seeley G.<br />\nMudd Fund.

Larry Denton, director of<br />\nadministrative services conceded<br />\nthat he attended \"one meeting in<br />\nthe summer as a representative of<br />\nGeorge Benton, Vice-president<br />\nfor Homewood Divisions, on the<br />\nhealth plan, but had since lost<br />\ncontact with the program.<br />\nJakie Hall, who as Dean of<br />\nstudents probably has the most<br />\ncontact of all administrators with<br />\nundergraduates, admitted that he<br />\nstill was not sure how the plan is<br />\nto be administered. \"We have<br />\nbeen, talking about it for a while<br />\nwith Dr. Torrey Brown and<br />\nothers.

We plan to keep<br />\nthe trees there, re-do and<br />\nimprove the path, the bridge and<br />\nthe tunnel and generally to<br />\nconstruct a very attractively<br />\nlandscaped new park.\" In<br />\naddition the University received a<br />\ngift of seven animal sculptures by<br />\nthe late Baniamino Bugano, a<br />\nprominent West Coast artist,<br />\nwhich' will be included in the new<br />\npark.<br />\nRobert Harvey, chairman of<br />\nthe Hopkins' Board of Trustees,<br />\nnoted that \"The start of<br />\nconstruction on this building<br />\nmarks the culmination of more<br />\nthan a decade of planning.

These gusts made passing<br />\nnearly impossible and nullified<br />\nany semblance of a kicking game<br />\non the part of either team.<br />\nAs a result, strategies had to be<br />\ndrastically readjusted as the<br />\ncontest progressed. According to<br />\nHopkins Head Coach Dennis<br />\nCox, the Jays (now 1-2 for the<br />\nyear) had hoped to put the ball<br />\ninto the air at least thirty times<br />\nbut, because of the winds, were<br />\nforced to resort to a ground<br /><br />\nattack and attempted only<br />\nfourteen aerials.<br />\nAlthough neither team was<br />\nable to score in the first half, it<br />\nwas rarely this climatic adversary<br />\nthat was the major cause. Rather,<br />\nit was an old and more familiar<br />\nproblem -turnovers -that kept<br />\nthe game at 0-0 after two<br />\nquarters.<br />\nNo less than seven fumbles and<br />\ninterceptions were recorded by<br />\nboth teams through the first<br />\nthirty minutes of play, bringing<br />\npossible scoring drives to<br />\nscreeching halts.<br />\nThe best opportunity to get<br />\nonto the scoreboard came just<br />\nseconds before the end of the<br />\nhalf. The Bears intercepted a<br />\nBlue Jay pass and returned the<br />\nball to the JHU eight yard line.<br />\nHowever, the Hopkins defense<br />\nstrengthened and a short field<br />\ngoal attempt on the fourth down<br />\nwas unsuccessful when the snap<br /><br />\nwas fumbled.<br />\nThe Jays scored what proved<br />\nto be the winning points midway<br />\nthrough the third quarter. Under<br />\nthe direction of quarterback Bob<br />\nGeist, Hopkins moved on the<br />\nground to a first down at the<br />\nUrsinus fifteen.<br />\nOn a third down and five<br />\nsituation, Geist spotted tight end<br />\nMike Rhodey over the middle<br />\nand rifled a pass to the senior<br />\ntri-captain. Without breaking<br />\nstride, Rhodey gathered in the<br />\npass and rambled untouched into<br />\nthe end zone for a 6-0 Hopkins<br />\nlead. Moments later, Geist<br />\nincreased that lead to 8-0 as he<br />\nrolled around right end for the<br />\ntwo-point conversion.<br />\nThe home team closed the gap<br />\nto 8-3 in the fourth quarter.<br />\nBeginning at their own<br />\nforty-four \u2022, the Bears drove to a<br />\nfirst down at the Blue Jays<br />\nfifteen but could go no farther.<br /><br />\nOn fourth down, a field goal<br />\nattempt was good-the first such<br />\nsuccessful try following three<br />\nprevious failures.<br />\nUrsinus had one last gasp<br />\nremaining. With onlytwo minutes.<br />\nremaining in the game, the Bears<br />\ngot the ball near midfield and<br />\nstarted to move. However a<br />\nfourth down pass at the Blue Jay<br />\nthirty-five fell incomplete and<br />\nHopkins had its first win of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nCoach Cox was obviously<br />\npleased with the results of the<br />\ncontest.<br />\n\"The first win is always the<br />\nhardest,\" he commented. \"I was<br />\nvery pleased with our effort.<br />\nWe've been involved in some<br />\ntough games and some teams<br />\nwould have folded-I think this<br />\nshows alot of character.\"<br />\n\"Our defense won the game<br />\nfor us,\" the Blue Jay mentor<br />\ncontinued. \"They did a great<br /><br />\njob-especially when you realize<br />\nhow long they were out there.\"<br />\nThe Coach also cited the<br />\nefforts of Geist, the reserve<br />\nquarterback. According to Cox,<br />\nthe team wasn't moving under<br />\nstarter Torn Bender, \"so<br />\ndecided to give Bob an<br />\nopportunity and he was a big<br />\nspark for us.\"<br />\nThe number of turnovers,<br />\nhowever, was disappointing to<br />\nthe Coach.<br />\n\"Two fumbles and two<br />\ninterceptions are too manY<br />\nmistakes,\" he explained. \"We<br />\nhave to work to eliminate the<br />\nteam-especiallY<br />\noffensive -mistakes.\"<br />\nThe Jays will try to even their<br />\nrecord this Saturday at home<br />\nagainst Salisbury State.

In May, the<br />\ndormitory and the fraternity<br />\nwhose teams have amassed the<br />\nhighest total of points are<br />\nawarded the BIA trophies.<br />\nThe first sport organized this<br />\nyear was Flag Football, which<br />\ngot underway Sept. 20. It has<br /><br />\nbeen difficult to schedule games<br />\naround all the rain that has<br />\noccurred recently, but after five<br />\ngames, perennial powers Du and<br />\nWilson-Wood are leading the frat<br />\nand dorm leagues respectively<br />\nwith perfect records.<br />\nA surprising trend in recent<br />\nyears is the increase in number<br />\nand ability of the independent<br />\nteams entering BIA tournaments.<br />\nThis year is no exception, as the<br />\nPackers and the Black Student<br />\nUnion currently hold third and<br />\nfourth places in the independent<br />\ndivision.<br />\nTwo of the \"minor sports\"<br />\nhave already been held.
