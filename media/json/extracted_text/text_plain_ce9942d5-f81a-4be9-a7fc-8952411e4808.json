Well, mass<br />\nmasturbation would be in poor taste (esincially in this<br />\nweather), but an increase in the purchases of skin mags at<br />\nthe Union Desk would be the sort of thing that would<br />\nmake the Council members stand up and take notice. \u2022<br />\nShould the Council turn against the student opinion,<br />\nand nay-say the potential Pornographers, students should<br />\nthen attempt to find their filth through other channels. We<br />\nat the News-Letter will do our part, by publishing a<br />\nqerialised account of the love lives of various Council<br />\nfunctionaries (although HOPSFA adamantly maintains<br />\nthat such material lies in their domain). One would expect<br />\nthat the Hopkins Band will take up the practice of playing<br />\nlewd music, and the Bicycle club will take its members<br />\nthroughout the campus on bikes, shouting obscenities.<br />\nAfter all, if the channels already exist, why not use<br />\nthem?<br />\n<br />\nPeabody<br />\nHey, Peabody: don'cha nate it when some dummy from<br />\nHopkins writes up your events, getting everything wrong?

We're anxious to see ya...<br />\n<br />\nThe gays have stormed out of the closet and into<br />\nthe streets, bowling over some misbegotten and<br />\nhard-hatted persecutions, but no amount of rhetoric<br />\nabout their liberation will culturally normalize<br />\nhomosexuality. If anything, within the next decade<br />\nor so, their rhetoric and activism will inspire an<br />\n(unfortunately) authoritarian backlash in a culture<br />\nthat grows weary of moral disorder. This is because<br />\nthere is such a thing as human nature, and to the<br />\nbest of our common-sense knowledge its moral recalcitrance to homosexuality is inexpungable.<br />\nThis recalcitrance is certainly not going to be<br />\nexpunged by the sort of arguments that have been<br />\nlaunched in the gay's defense so far. Arguments to<br />\nthe effect that homosexuality is a natural expression<br />\n(countering the assumption that it is \"unnatural\")<br />\nare hopeless. This is because our concept of the<br />\nnatural is too vague to establish standards by which<br />\nthe natural and the unnatural, as such, could be<br />\ndistinguished. But, of course, this also means that<br />\narguments condemning homosexuality as unnatural<br />\nare just as hopeless. Basically, we decide what is<br />\nnatural on an inductive basis, in which case<br />\nhomosexuals seem to get an essentially negative<br />\nbilling. Still, the homosexual may advance theses<br />\nappealing to the artifice of social repression and<br />\nevolutionary advance to explain, respectively, the<br />\nfact that gays and bisexuals are a minority and that<br />\nthey exist. Otherwise, the homosexual may<br />\nexplicitly reject naturalness as a necessary condition<br />\nof goodness. If he were to do so I think he would be<br />\ncorrect., but then he would find himself out of step<br />\nwith a culture that puts its very highest premium on<br />\n\"naturality.\" But this premium is surely to be<br />\nrejected as nonsense, for much goodness involves<br />\nartifice, marriage for example. But clearly, there is<br />\nno absolutely decisive case for the naturality of<br />\nhomosexuality any more than there is such a case<br />\nfor its unnaturalness.<br />\nAppeals to \"latent tendency\", for example, do<br />\nnot successfully naturalize gayness any more than<br />\nsuch appeals could naturalize (read: justify)<br />\ncleptomania. Indeed, someone might claim that he<br />\nhas a \"latent tendency\", to oppress homosexuals. It<br />\nis easy to see that the concept of latent tendency is<br />\nas vague as the concept of naturality and that it is<br />\nconsequently useless as a justification device.<br />\nSo it is that, in spite of the impossiblity of<br />\nproving the thesis that homosexuality is not natural,<br />\npeople, generally speaking (and in spite of liberal<br />\nrhetoric at parties), cannot be convinced that it is<br />\nnatural. In any event, they cannot be convinced that<br />\nit is good. Homosexuality has always been with us<br />\n(in the closet) and it has always been regarded as<br />\nmorally problematic, and it probably always will be.<br />\nThis fact cannot be explained, or rejected in terms<br />\nof some rationally constructed morality. (Indeed,<br />\nthe attempt to consteuct a rational morality is<br />\nfarcical.)<br />\nThe stigmatic character of homosexuality is<br />\nirreducible, and any common sensically practical<br />\napproach to it will have to face up to this. No<br />\nmatter now frustratingly mysterious, the moral<br />\nrejection of homosexuality is not about to be<br />\nrooted out of human nature by any amount of<br />\nmarches, or speeches or political activism.<br />\nWhy has a massive campaign to normalize<br />\nhomosexuality (or for that matter, heterosexual<br />\nperversions) been launched in the first place?<br />\nBecause the homosexual believes in the naturalistic<br />\nideologists dating back to Rousseau. that his sense<br />\nof alienation, shame, and/or guilt, is rooted in<br />\nconventional cultural attitudes rather than<br />\nsomething as immovable as human nature itself. He<br />\nsays as much. He feels that if he can change the<br />\n<br />\nconventions as such\u2014which would be malleable as<br />\nconventions\u2014he can relieve his personal psychology.<br />\nTo be sure, the moral consensus of the community<br />\nweighs on any individual whose behavior falls<br />\noutside of it, but that consensus may itself be an<br />\nexpression of anthropologically endemic moral<br />\nattitudes. Hence, it is conceivable that the<br />\nhomosexual could extablish a merely conventional<br />\nsocial acceptance for himself and still be plagued by<br />\nendemic psychological problems.<br />\nAll in all, the alteration of the public response to<br />\nhomosexuality seems a poor practical strategy if this<br />\nis meant to resolve the homosexual's relevant<br />\npsychological difficulties as a whole.(The heart of<br />\nhis problem may, after all, be the massive<br />\nbreakdown of heterosexual romance. Too many<br />\npeople are seeking meaningless independence and<br />\n\"freedom\" instead of the challenges of real love and<br />\ncommitment.)<br />\nIn any event, if the attainment of the gay's<br />\ncommunity's goals within the realm of public policy<br />\ndoes not, in fact, relieve all individual homosexuals<br />\nof the relevant psychological difficulties, then those<br />\nwho are not relieved will find that the honest, and<br />\ntruly practical strategy, has altered dramatically. It<br />\nwill amount to the individual's private search for<br />\nsalvation from homosexuality. But here he is left in<br />\nthe lurch not only by the contemporary breakdown<br />\nof hetero sexual romance but by modern<br />\npsychology which is engaged all too often in the<br />\npractically vacuous project of trying to convince<br />\ndisturbed people that there is nothing to be<br />\ndisturbed about and that therefore they ought not<br />\nbedisturbed. Nevertheless, they remain disturbed.<br />\nThis reassurance strategy is the psychological.<br />\nbranch of a larger existential strategy which is an<br />\nattempt to do away with the whole concept of the<br />\nimmoral. That is, modern man, having no recourse<br />\nto re ligious grace, finds himself in a situation<br />\nwhere he can only attack guilt and shame as the<br />\nartifice of unwanted and unnecessary ideas like \"thimmoral.\" The attempt to destigmatize<br />\nhomosexuality (or for that m.tter heterosexual<br />\npromiscuity) is a sub-strategy within this larger<br />\nstrategy. We can see how hopeless this sub-strategy<br />\nis when we re cognize the hopelessness of the larger<br />\nstrategy it is a part of. Obviously we cannot rid<br />\nourselves of the concept of the immoral, nor is<br />\ndoing so in any way practical; not only would<br />\nwidespread moral despair remain with us, mayhem<br />\nwould break out..<br />\nModern man, for all his technology, is<br />\n_pathetically impractical in all of the really<br />\nimportant respects (the psychological ones). In an<br />\nage of rampant ideology he has lost his common<br />\nsense in almost every way that is is genuinely<br />\npossible to<br />\nhe attempts to pop-psychologize<br />\nand politicize himself into happiness. But practical<br />\nnecessity may driv e him b,.ck to common sense- to<br />\nintuitiv e m orality as opposed to activities that<br />\ncon flict. with it and corresponding (hopeless)<br />\nideologies of reassurance. The rejection of the<br />\nconcept of the immoral can only go so far before it<br />\ndestroys the liberal culture it is meant to insure.<br />\nTolerance itself is a moral obligation. With the,<br />\nperhaps, inevitable revival in force of the concept of<br />\nthe immoral and the recovery of moral sensitivity<br />\nper se, we may begin to see that homosexuals have<br />\nbeen hypocritically char acterized as one of the<br />\nforemost symptoms of decadence. We will see that<br />\nmany forms of visciousness have been hiding in the<br />\nsupposed hetero sexual \"healthiness\"-for example.<br />\nthe businessman who is more loyal to the fast buck<br />\nthan he is to his wife and kids.

The present<br />\ncontroversy over Dr. Pfeffer<br />\narose last spring aftef he was<br />\ndenied a recommendation for<br />\ntenure by the Political Science<br />\nDepartment.

Dr. Benton's position<br />\nwas phased out during last<br />\nsummer's administrative<br />\nreorganization. Since Ms.<br />\nKoenigsberg did not have<br />\nsufficient time last year to permit<br />\nher to accomplish much, the<br />\nStudent Council allowed her to<br />\nbe appointed directly to the<br />\nDenton assistantship without<br />\nundergoing the selection process<br />\na second time.<br />\nMr. Denton described her<br />\nposition as a \"formal liason with<br />\nthe Student Council.\" He praised<br />\nthe creation of the assistantship.<br />\n\"It's important for us to have<br />\nstudent input.\"<br />\nAccording to Ms. Koenigsberg,<br />\nher duties include attendance of<br />\n!Student Council meetings,<br />\nsu rveyance of literature going out<br />\nof Mr. Denton's office, and<br />\nparticipation as a non-voting<br />\nmember of the Academic<br />\nServices Committee.<br />\n\"Most of my work will go with<br />\nDenton,\" she commented, \"and<br />\nsome with Provost Longaker, if<br />\nthere's anything the students<br />\nwould like conveyed to him.\"<br />\nThe assistantship to Dr.<br />\nBenton formerly carried<br />\nwork-study pay.

There are those who dance in record stores,<br />\nmaking quiet little steps to the ubiquitous pop beat as<br />\nthey rummage through bins of Bee Gee albums; there are<br />\nthose who dutifully hustle or fox-trot their way through a<br />\ndance so as not to seem out of step with their peers.<br />\nThere are those who dance like pros, and there are those<br />\nwho can barely stand straight on their feet.<br />\nAnd then there is the ballet. It's hard to place ballet<br />\non the same level as these other dances, just as it seems<br />\nIncomprehensible to say that Julian Bream and the kid<br />\ndown the street with a Telecaster are doing the same<br />\nthing. But dance is dance, and despite the radical<br />\ndifference between its levels, arnny dancers see each level<br />\nas being as worthwhile as the others. Or at least that's<br />\nWhat we gathered from the few dancers we spoke with,<br />\nafter the opening of this year's Maryland Ballet season.<br />\nTo start at the beginning, upon receiving an invitation<br />\nto the ballet, we were eager to go, but rather hesitant to<br />\nreview; after all, we could find no one on our staff who<br />\nPretended to know anything about the dance. Thus,<br />\nfiguring that a film critic and an music critic would put us<br />\nsomewhere near the desired target, we packed ourselves<br />\nInto an awaiting vehicle, and set out in the general<br />\ndirection of the Lyric Theatre.<br />\nUpon arrival, the music critic noticed that there was no<br />\norchestra, merely speakers. A common practice among<br />\nsmaller companieS, as an entire orchestra would be<br />\nProhibitively expensive for any but the largest of the<br />\nlarge. (Afterwards, one of the dancers told us that she<br />\n?referred dancing to recorded music ratherthan live.<br />\nWhen you're standing on stage, all you can hear is one<br />\nPart of the orchestra. On one side it's just horns, on<br />\nanother side it's just strings. It's much more difficult; you<br />\nreally have to count everything out.\"<br />\nAlthough the music critic found that the sound of<br />\nbroadcast recorded music to be gratingly artificial, he had<br />\nto admit that the dancing usually distracted his attention<br />\nfrom such minor irritaiions. The film critic merely wished<br />\nthat someone in the tech crew had checked the levels<br />\nfirst, so that the onrush of recorded fanfare was not so<br />\nJarring.<br />\nWith the fanfare, though, came the dancers, and with<br />\nthem came our expectations. What would we see? What<br />\nwould they do? The first tableaux was entitled Pas de<br />\nTrois Royale and it was a strictly classical dance. A strong<br />\nsense of form, of style was evident throughout, and had<br />\nwe. any training, we probably could have recognized<br />\nvarious standard dance actions.<br />\nAs it was, though, we merely notic d the solos, duos,<br />\nand trios in the performance. The sense of movement was<br />\nstunning, we amateurs were, on the whole, impressed.<br />\nThe second work was a modern piece, entitled<br />\nBelong:, It was a duet between principals Sylvester<br />\nCamben and<br />\nCamille Izard. A formless, fluid, physical<br />\nrhapsody, the dancers began lying in a prone position on<br />\nstage, danced, and finished in nearly the same position.<br />\nAs with the first dance, \"Belong\" had no ostensible<br />\nPiot, at least not in the standard story-line sense. Yet<br />\nth<br />\ne re was a<br />\nuniting emotional strain, a single flow of ideas<br />\nand. feelings which were visually whispered to the<br />\naudience. Like the resonance of poetic allusion, one heard<br />\nWhat was said with out actually realizing that it was being<br />\nsaid<br />\nIf the beauty of feeling could be adequately translated<br />\nt\u00b0 Physical activity, \"Belong\" would approximated that<br />\n<br />\ntranslation. Both dancers, and particularly Campbell,<br />\nexhibited a sensuality that transcended the puerile limits<br />\nof eroticism, reaching an esthetic plane that was at once<br />\nmodest and decadent.<br />\nFollowing \"Belong\" there was an intermission, and<br />\nthen the major piece of the evening \"Sebastian.\" It was<br />\nthe only work on the program which was totally<br />\nplot-oriented, and also the only one with music written<br />\nexpressly for the action. But as in a play, although the<br />\ntext remains standard, the setting changes from director<br />\nto director;<br />\nand \"Sebastina,\" as choreographed by John Butler, had<br />\nan identity of its own, independent of other<br />\ninterpertations.<br />\nThe plot is rather simple. The prince falls in love with a<br />\nbeautiful courtesan; his possessive sisters oppose the<br />\nunion. Sebastian, a Moorish slave of the royal family,<br />\nloves the courtesan, and, when he sees that the sisters are<br />\nkilling the courtesan through black magic, lie substitutes<br />\nhimself for the wax effigy of the courtesan, suffering<br />\ndeath at the arrows intended for his forbidden love, and<br />\nthus Essential in the development of the plot is, of<br />\ncourse, the character of Sebastian, and the responsibility<br />\nwas borne expertly by Mr. Campbell. In the character of<br />\nSebastian, one finds echoes of Petroushka (echoed to an<br />\nextent in the score) and commedia del'arte; the title is, of<br />\n<br />\nnights<br />\nat the<br />\nballet<br />\ncourse, an allusion to the Martyrdom of St. Sebastian<br />\nElements of all this are picked up in the brilliant,<br />\nempathetic performance of Mr. Campbell.<br />\nCarrying himself with a sense of graceful restraint, his<br />\nmovements implied a force he dared not express. While<br />\nthe courtesan writhed in pain, victim of the black magic<br />\narrows, Sebastian reached out with compassion, with a<br />\nyearning to help that touched her in a way more<br />\nsignificant than the physical contact he was denied by<br />\ncaste. Sylvester Campbell moved eloquently, expressing in<br />\nsheer motion intricacies of desire that words could never<br />\ntouch.<br />\nOther characters were good; Ion Florin Scarlat was<br />\nsuitably statel4 as the Prince, Mary McGaw-Miller and<br />\nNorma Pera convincingly cold as his sisters. Camille Izard,<br />\nwho seems to be recognized as an ideal foil for Mr.<br />\nCampbell, was sinuously seductive as the courtesan, while<br />\nregaining as sense of compassion for Sebastian;<br />\ncompassion, alas, that seemed tempered by her even<br />\ngreater love for the Prince.<br />\nBoth the film critic and the music critic nave little or<br />\nno idea how much credit is due the choreographer as<br />\nopposed the dancers; however, we were told by various<br />\nmembers of the company that John Butler was an<br />\nunqualified genius, who,as one member put it, \"expected<br />\nnothing but the best, and got nothing but willing<br />\n<br />\nassistance.\" There were some brilliant moments of<br />\ndancing by the company in the background of this piece;<br />\nneither of us could grasp the specific symbolism involved,<br />\nbut it seemed evident that the set dancing, like the<br />\nabstract scenery, carried some structural signifigance.<br />\nOne needn't be a member of the cognoscenti to be in<br />\nawe of a moving performance, however, and both the<br />\nmusic critic and the film critic had to admit that they<br />\nwere moved.\"Modern Dance,\" said the film critic,\"seems<br />\nto be their strong point.\" The music critic nodded in<br />\nnumbedassention.<br />\nAgain an intermission, and then the last piece,<br />\n\"Napoli.\" A classical ballet, it was by far the most<br />\nclassical number on the programming, as the program<br />\nnotes assured we novices that the choreography was by<br />\nAugust Bournonville, who originally choreographed the<br />\n1842 premiere. \"The form of the ballet has been retained<br />\nfor the present production.\"<br />\nThe basic mode of \"Napoli\" is that of a terpsichorean<br />\njam session, where each of the ten dancers is given the<br />\nopportunity to \"show his stuff,\" in a solo or duo<br />\nperformance. With dancers leaping, twirling and almost<br />\nfloating across the stage, the visual extravagance more<br />\nthan made up for the melodic paucity of the music. Linda<br />\nKintz was especially notable for her omnipresent smile<br />\nand exhausting exhuberance.<br />\nAfterwards, after a winding drive through Mount<br />\nVernon, the two dance-saturated critics found their way<br />\nto a\"recepting\" at a disco called Casablanca. Casablanca is<br />\none of those deceptively glossy establishments, filled with<br />\nmen whose hair is self-consciously styled, and women<br />\nwho attempt to dress out of Vougue with a Mademoiselle<br />\nbudget and sense of aesthetics. Remarked one critic to the<br />\nother, \"I had always suspected these people existed, but I<br />\nnever knew where...\"<br />\nLeaving the upstairs disco, our budding interviewers<br />\nstood downstairs near the bar, in wait for dancers.<br />\nFinally, they arrived, and we approached, unfortunately<br />\nwithout questions. They kindly tolerated our gaffe, and<br />\nasked us, \"this was your first ballet? Did you leave<br />\nsmiling?\" The joy of dance was foremost on their minds.<br />\nFinally happening on a darker who wasn't too<br />\nexhausted to be bothered (one felt guilty pestering<br />\nprincipals), we managed a coherent line of questioning.<br />\nHad she been dancing long? \"Ever since I was ten. 1 used<br />\nto move to music, and my mother said, 'Get this ked to<br />\ndancing class!\"<br />\nMusic to her meant dance. \"I can't imagine people just<br />\nsitting when they play music; that's why I have trouble<br />\nwith concerts. That's why I could never play an<br />\ninstrument. I thought about taking piano, but it's a little<br />\ntoo stationary...<br />\n\"I think it's great that more and more people are going<br />\nto the ballet. I love it...there are days when I get up, and I<br />\njust can't believe that I'm making a living at what lenjoy.<br />\nI mean, it's a lot of work, but it's never been a job... It's<br />\ngreat!\"<br />\nWell, we critics must admit that it was fun, although it<br />\nwill be a while before either of us will become full-fledged<br />\nafficianados. Dance takes time to get used to, but it's<br />\ncertainly time well-spent. The Maryland Ballet's next<br />\nperformance is in two weeks, at Goucher. If you have ever<br />\nmarvelled at the beauty of the human form, or at the<br />\ngrace of an athelete, perhaps you might like tile dance.

Her name appears above<br />\nthe film title on the Playhouse Theater's marquee, but<br />\nFaustina is no more than a vehicle for Adjani titan Birth<br />\nofa Nation was for Raoul Walsh.<br />\nThe real subject of the film, Faustine, is played by<br />\nactress Muriel Catala. Although other characters, Isabella<br />\nAdjani among them, influence the outcome of the film, it<br />\nis primarily concerned with Faustine's observations of<br />\nthose characters and of herself.<br />\nAn opening, pre-credit sequence, in which Faustine has<br />\na conversation with herself, is important to an<br />\nunderstanding of the film, because it makes clear to the<br />\nviewer, from the very beginning, that all conversation or<br />\naction in the film is only important insofar as it concerns<br />\nFaustine. That is quite a burden for any actress,to bear,<br />\nand while Catala seems capable, the role she plays is not<br />\nsufficiently well-developed. In other words, she is a main<br />\ncharacter without much character.<br />\nFaustine, a schoolgirl, around 16 years of age, spends<br />\nher summer vacation in the country with her<br />\ngrandparents, something she has not done since the age of<br />\ntwelve. As one might expect, the grandparents are little<br />\nmore than fixtures in the house, and even the house itself<br />\nis of no real concern to Campaneez, because Faustine'<br />\npends most of her time wandering in the fields, hugging<br />\nand caressing the stalks of grain, and looking quite<br />\nsensuous.<br />\nShe is an adolescent, but on the verge of maturity, and<br />\nthe film's real concern is with how this young girl matures<br />\nduring a summer vacation. That may not be a terribly<br />\noriginal or profound theme, but it could be interesting,<br />\nespecially if, through insightful acting and screenwriting,<br />\nthe audience could perceive the progressive maturation of<br />\n<br />\nthe main character. In Faustine, unfortunately, there are<br />\nnot enough scenes revealing the psychology of Faustine<br />\nand too many scenes emphasizing the sensuous physical<br />\nworld around her.<br />\nIn an early scene, for instance, Faustine lies on the<br />\ngrass, watching two bathers, one of them nude. Variations<br />\non this scene recur throughout the film, because Faustine<br />\nis constantly on the outside, detached from the action<br />\n,<br />\nobserving the domestic and amorous lives of others<br />\n. The<br />\nothers, in this case, are a neighboring family, of which<br />\nAdjani is a member, whose summer existence, like<br />\nFaustine's, is a leisurely series of night walks through the.<br />\nwoods, tea breaks on the terrace, and swims in the lake.<br />\nCampaneez, apparently not content with merely<br />\nfilming Faustine as an adolescent on the outside of an<br />\nadult world, makes an embarrassingly heavy handed<br />\nattempt to symbolically emphasize Faustine's position.<br />\nWhen Faustine watches her neighbors she is often on the<br />\noutside of their blue garden fence, and at one point she<br />\nsays to herself, \"The door is blue that opens on the<br />\nworld.\" As one might expect, when Faustine finally does<br />\nmature, i.e. when she is no longer an observer of lovers<br />\nbut a lover herself, the final lines of the film tell us: \"And<br />\nfinally Faustine went through that blue door.\" Now,it is<br />\nhighly likely that an adolescent girl like Faustine, enrolled<br />\nin Symbolism 101, would create a mental landscape<br />\nof blue doors and fences, but the doors and fences really<br />\nare intensely blue, leading one to conclude that not<br />\nFaustine alone, but Campaneez as well, is enrolled in an<br />\nelementary course where symbolism is always spelled with<br />\na capital S.<br />\nkin even more irritating flaw, because it is present in<br />\nnearly every scene, is that Campaneez continually reminds<br />\nus, through sound and image, of how wonderfully<br />\nsensuous and beautiful it is to live and love in the<br />\ncountry. Many scenes do have a natural, seductive beauty,<br />\n<br />\nbut the beauty of other scenes is artificial, contrived: yo,<br />\ncan bet your bottom dollar that if Faustine, dresse<br />\ndI<br />\npink, wanders through a rose garden, the roses will also b,<br />\npink. There are scenes where a real sense<br />\nof passional(<br />\nlovemaking on the forest floor is conveyed,<br />\nbut too ofter<br />\nCampaneez slips into the banal cliches of splend<br />\nor in tht<br />\ngrass you can bet another bottom dollar that when the<br />\nhands of lovers touch it is filmed with close- shots, it<br />\nup<br />\nwhat seems to be slow motion.<br />\nThen there is the music, a virtual romantic torrent<br />\nof<br />\npiano music by Chopin, Lizst, and Tchaikovsky among<br />\nothers. Sometimes it is generated from within the scene.<br />\nwhen a character sits down at the piano and plays little<br />\na<br />\natmosphere, but usually, when Faustine<br />\nis walking<br />\nthrough the forest, it comes from the heavens and fills the<br />\nsoundtrack. There is nothing wrong with Campaneez's<br />\nselection of music, for it often does provid aural<br />\ne<br />\nsensations which complement the physical landsc<br />\nape<br />\naround Faustine and the emotional landsc<br />\nape within het.<br />\nThe problem is that Campaneez does not know<br />\nwhen to<br />\ntake the needle off the record.<br />\nFaustine has spent most of her summer observing the<br />\nlives of others, rejecting all suitors, and dreami<br />\nng of a<br />\nromantic love for herself: there is at least one sequence<br />\nin<br />\nthe film in which Faustine, hugging herself<br />\n, imagines that<br />\nit is a man hugging her. \"I've always<br />\ndreamed a lot and<br />\nI'm afraid to face reality,\" says Faustine of<br />\nher life, but<br />\nwhen she does love a man at tne end, and goes throug<br />\nh<br />\nher symbolic blue door with him, one gets the impression<br />\nnot so much that Faustine has replaced<br />\ndreams of love<br />\nwith real love, but that dreams of love have<br />\nbeen replaced<br />\nby a dreamy love.<br />\nWhen Faustine returns to school in the fall, hopefully<br />\nat an urban institution, perhaps enrollment in an intensive<br />\ncourse in Italian neorealism will teach her that most<br />\ndoors are brown.<br />\n<br />\n:77trt<br />\n<br />\nYou probably think all those Judy<br />\nGarland and<br />\nMickey Rooney movies are all a lot of bunk.<br />\nI mean, who<br />\ncan ever believe such a flimsy premise<br />\nas two lovesick<br />\ncollege kids turningto each other and saying<br />\n, \"Gee, why<br />\ndon't we put on a play?\" Sounds corny?<br />\nWell, such corn<br />\nis husked every October when The<br />\nBarnstormers band<br />\ntogether to present The Freshman One-Acts,<br />\na theatrical<br />\ncollage designed to initiate freshmen to the<br />\nfootlights of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"Magic to Do,\" this year's freshmen<br />\nfollies, will be<br />\npresented tonight and Saturday at eight<br />\np.m. in the<br />\nListening Viewing Room of the Hopkins<br />\nUnion. The fifty<br />\ncents admission The best one-act of<br />\nthe program was<br />\nthe excerpt from Lilian Hellman's thirtie<br />\ns' classic, \"The<br />\nChildren's Hour.\" Directed by Keno Rider,<br />\nboth Donna<br />\nDow and Katherine Evans offer finely<br />\n-drawn and sensitive<br />\nportraits of two New England. school<br />\nteachers derided by<br />\nthe whispers of alledgect Lesbianism<br />\nspread by a pupil.<br />\nFor once it seemed as if the actors had<br />\nforgotten they<br />\n<br />\nwere On a stage. They exuded a state of total<br />\nconcentration that has been long absent from the Hopkins<br />\nstage.<br />\nNext best on the program was Susan F. Obrecht's<br />\nadaptation of the Woody Allen short story, \"The Whore<br />\nof Mensa.\" The plot can best be summarized as a dual<br />\nparody of pulp detective stories and<br />\nprostitute-with-a-golden-heart fables. Josiah Gluck plays<br />\nKaiser Lupowitz,the gumshoe, a bit too fast and campy.<br />\nOn the other hand, Kelliann Hess plays Sherry, the<br />\nslattern who stimulates intellectually horny men's minds<br />\nwith discussions of Herman Melville, with just the right<br />\ntouch of cerebral raciness.<br />\nMichael Bannon sensitively plays a corpse who comes<br />\nbriefly back to life in \"A Soul ComeHome.\" Killed by<br />\ncomplications following TB and malnutrition, Mr. Bannon<br />\nrises from the dead to berate his mother (Daphne<br />\nGolding) for her fatal neglect of him. This segment is<br />\nhindered by an overly heavy ending which is more the<br />\n<br />\nplaywright's fault than anyone else's. Celeste Yousoof<br />\nhas adapted and directed selections from Shakespeare in<br />\nan act called \"Shakespearian Lovers\" This segment is<br />\na bit<br />\ntoo long, and could be cut in places, but the enthusiasm<br />\ngenerated by the cast carries the interest. Bruce Nib, Bill<br />\nOberle, Lisa Gottesfeld, Susan Obrecht, Eric Schum<br />\nacher,<br />\nElizabeth Unger, and Robert O'Rourke all do,<br />\nwell in their<br />\ndifficult roles as Shakespearian stooges.<br />\nThe two musical numbers,\"Magic to Do\" from \"Pipin<br />\n\"<br />\nand \"Aquarius\" from \"Hair\", are the opening<br />\nand closing<br />\nacts of the evening. Both numbers understandab<br />\nly need<br />\nmorepolish, but one must realize that musica<br />\nl talent is<br />\nhard to come by at such an academically orient campu<br />\ned<br />\ns<br />\nas Hopkins. Eric Schumacher and Beth Davis, the<br />\ntwo<br />\nfeatured performers, are perhaps a bit too enthusi<br />\nastic;<br />\none can tell they are trying too hard. But<br />\nthis is just a<br />\nminor quibble that one hopes will not dampe<br />\nn the spirit.<br />\nAll in all, it is a very enjoyable evening and<br />\nI have no acts<br />\nto grind.<br />\n<br />\n\f'October 7, 1977/ PAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nS,<br />\n<br />\nye<br />\nd ii<br />\noh<br />\nnat<br />\nfter<br />\nth<br />\nthe<br />\n3, ir<br />\n<br />\nt of<br />\nong<br />\n<br />\nttle<br />\n:ing<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nIral<br />\nwe<br />\n<br />\niel\u2022<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n\u00eda<br />\nin<br />\nlat<br />\nnd<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\ngh<br />\nDn<br />\nye<br />\ned<br />\nly<br />\nye<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\n% GET BACK TO<br />\n%<br />\n\"THE\"<br />\n%o<br />\nNATURAL...<br />\n%<br />\n% Naturally,<br />\n%k we serve<br />\nFrogurt.<br />\n....<br />\nkny<br />\n1<br />\nF'roguik<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOccice oC Special Events<br />\npresents<br />\n<br />\nDiaect caom Wales<br />\n<br />\nTHOMAS<br />\nLIVED HERE\"<br />\n<br />\n\"DYLAN<br />\n<br />\nA one-man peacoarnance in<br />\nprose ans5 verse<br />\nwith<br />\n<br />\nRozeniwurt<br />\n<br />\nAT \"THE\"<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\n1 VISIT<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br />\nFOR SOFT SERVE<br />\nS AND<br />\nTHE PATIO<br />\nFOR HAND DIP<br />\n4- ALL NATURAL<br />\nLOW FAT<br />\n1/2 CALORIES OF ICE CREAM<br />\n* YOGURT CULTURES<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nThursday, Oct. 13<br />\nTelevision and Violence:<br />\nEncouragement or Escape?\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. George<br />\nGerbner<br />\n<br />\nRag HanOy<br />\n<br />\nSATURDAY,<br />\nOCTOBER 15, 1977,8 P.M.<br />\nShaivea Hall AaOltoRiciro .<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Univeasity<br />\nHornewooes Campus<br />\n<br />\nk<br />\n<br />\nTickets: Regulaa - $3.00<br />\nFull-time staOents with ID.<br />\nanO Senior Citizens with I.D. - $2.00.<br />\nFoa caRtbea incoarnation;call 338-7158.<br />\n<br />\nMonday, Oct. 10<br />\n\"Ind now a word from our<br />\nsponsors...Advertising on TV\"<br />\n<br />\nJohn Maher<br />\n<br />\nSenior Vice President, J.

Jealousy of his off-campus<br />\nclassmates, I reasoned, had snapped his mind.<br />\nThe incident was good for half a dozen more chuckles<br />\nbetween there and my apartment, but it also prompted<br />\nme to recall events and feelings<br />\nthat had gathered a<br />\nconsiderable coating of dust over the summer. Of course I<br />\nknew that my<br />\npresent physical situation was far and away<br />\nbetter than it was as a freshman but had my friends and<br />\ntraded something much more valuable for the relative<br />\nopulence of off-campus life?

Now, I am not singling you in<br />\nparticular as being responsible for this calumny; your<br />\npublication is only a mirror for the society at large. I still<br />\nhave faith in your integrity and concern for the public<br />\nwelfare. For this reason I come to you with a plan that I<br />\nhave for restoring awe and respect for the true faith in the<br />\nhearts and minds of our young people. over whom I know<br />\nyou exert considerable influence.<br />\nTo my mind, the unbounded proliferation of religious<br />\ntracts and artifacts during the latter middle ages and<br />\nrenaissance period instilled a ho-hum attitude toward<br />\ntheir subject matter on the part of those who came in<br />\nexcessive contact With them. With the advent of mass<br />\ncommunications, the printing press and public museums,<br />\nthe exposure of these artifacts was extended far beyond<br />\nthe confines of their intended audience. AR.enaissance<br />\npainter or sculptor could borrow a subject already<br />\nemployed by some other artist in another work and, due<br />\nto the poor system of communications, never have to<br />\nworry about someone coming across a companion piece<br />\nand accusing him of plagarism or, at the very least,<br />\nunoriginality. However, with the wider awareness of<br />\ntoday's public and their greater sophistication, such an<br />\nindescretion is immediately pounced upon. The events<br />\nand miracles from the holy book are mistakenly believed<br />\nto be as common as their physical representations.<br />\nThere remains only one solution to this epidemic of<br />\nblasaity. That consists of the destruction of fully ninety<br />\npercent of the religious works now in existence. Only<br />\noriginals of the best quality should be preserved as<br />\nbefitting the Christian faith and our lord Jesus Christ.<br />\nFurthermore, legislation should be enacted limiting the<br />\n<br />\nnumber of reproductions to a low figure that would in no<br />\nway corrupt the reputation of the original pieces.<br />\nI sincerely hope that you will consider my proposal and<br />\ngive it the consideration worthy of aChristian gentleman<br />\nsuch as yourself.

In comparing \"Rose Garden\" to<br />\n\"Cuckoo's Nest\", she stresses the lack of explanation for<br />\nthe actions of the main character Deborah, as well as<br />\nthose of the other patients. It is evident that Ms. Aleiss<br />\nexpresses the ignorance which many laymen have about<br />\nmental illness\u2014especially psychosis, of which<br />\nschizophrenia is but one variety. Ms. Aleiss appears to be<br />\nskeptical that the reason for Deborah's actions could be<br />\nthat a group of fantasized gods order her to do things.<br />\nSchizophrenia is characterized by a loss of the meaning of<br />\nreality. It is quite typical for someone wilo is psychotic to<br />\npursue self-destructive activities such as burning and<br />\ncutting oneself for precisely such reasons, however<br />\nirrational. Does Ms. Aleiss realize that the story is really a<br />\ntrue one based on Hannah Green's (a pseudonym) own<br />\nlife?<br />\n\"Deborah's ...sensationalism lacks explanation\"<br />\nbecause in real life no one knows the answers.

Chicago's<br />\nDirector of Placement speaking:<br />\n\"There's a story I often tell about the guy who stood<br />\nup to the radicals during the Dow (Chemical) era. The<br />\nradicals were out in the business quad, marching and<br />\ntormenting Dow and tormenting the business school. Our<br />\nbusi ness school jocks came out from an LPF clutching<br />\ntheir beer cans; they were all men in those days, or<br />\nostensibly men. A bearded mail from the radical group<br />\nstepped forward like a soloist from a glee club and said<br />\nbeautifully, 'You've got it wrong, old chap.

The first point we would like<br />\nto refute is the supposed unwillingness of students to eat<br />\nthe meals. We have seen students wait in line for half an<br />\nhour in breathless anticipation of what delicacy would be<br />\noffered. In other words, they come in green, not leave<br />\ngreen as some subversives would lead us to believe.<br />\nClearly, such sacrifice indicates real commitment.<br />\nAs for the second point, that the food is slightly<br />\ninedible, this is a gross exaggeration. Why, nothing is more<br />\ndelicious in the morning than the tantalizing scent of<br />\nfreshly powdered eggs. Not only does Hopkins food<br />\nprovide the eight essential carbohydrates and starches<br />\nessential for growing bodies, it also presents--adventure!<br />\nOften, students can be found unwinding from a hard<br />\nafternoon of Chem lab, picking through the stew in hot<br />\npursuit of those shrewd little pieces of meat and<br />\nvegetables. And, to top it off, Hopkins meals are creative.<br />\nWhere else could you get pizza, spaghetti, ravioli, stew,<br />\nmeatloaf, Sloppy Joes, and just plain mush from that<br />\nsingle itty, bitty can:<br />\nThe third point is self-evident. Hopkins lacrosse balls<br />\nare not, and never have been, synthesized from leftover<br />\nmeatballs. Why, anyone \"in the know\" will tell you that<br />\nthe balls are merely grapefruits (who, by the way, as a<br />\nprotest against Anita Bryant's continued presence in<br />\nFlorida, volunteered of their own free will).<br />\nNaturally, we cannot expect the situation to improve<br />\nwithout decisive action. This is why the Office of the<br />\nChaplain will present a series of workshops and movies<br />\n(listed below) about cafeteria food during the January<br />\nintersession. We can only hope that it is not too late.<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nelementary macaroni: Consumption possibility of<br />\nnoodles plotted against curves of stew, fish, bread, etc.<br />\nAlso included: when to eat guns with butter and when a<br />\nlittle asparagus would be nice for a change. Caution:<br />\nextensive lab work may result in corporal inflation.<br />\ninto<br />\nvegetables: Why vegetables grown in a state of<br />\nnature might be more willing to stay awake during<br />\nlectures than those grown in the state of New Jersey.<br />\nTechniques of vegetating in class will be used in coping<br />\nwith day-to-day legumes. Students are encouraged to<br />\nrelax, take a few deep breaths, and close their eyes before<br />\neating. Pre-requisite: Ox Sieve.<br />\npre-meals: A sprecial course for pre-meds who want to<br />\nbe spoon- fed Calculus and Organic Chemistry<br />\n(intravenous feeding reserved for those in the 2-5<br />\ndrogram).<br />\nun, deux, trois; nous mangeons du bois: For those<br />\ninterested in the fine art of French dining. This course is<br />\ndesigned for those upper class- men who swore off<br />\nuniversity food after their freshmen year. Students will<br />\nalso be taught proper etiquette, including why it is<br />\nimproper to use the meatloaf as a paperweight. Fencing<br />\nwith celery sticks is permissible but is usually considered<br />\nto be in very mediocre taste. Remember, our motto is,<br />\n\"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow who knows<br />\nwhat they'll be serving for lunch!\"<br />\nFirst Annual Hoptlops: A fun-filled, fantastic, food<br />\nfest prepared by the Hopkins Food Lovers' Only<br />\nPreservation Society. Highlights include a premier<br />\nshowing of The Seven Percent Solution (a detective is<br />\nbaffled by a mysterious drowning in Campbell's cream of<br />\nmushroom soup), a milk chugging contest, and a special<br />\npresentation of the Golden Gums Award for merit- orious<br />\nmu nching.<br />\nWe hope that this program wilj encourage students to<br />\nmaintain a brighter outlook about cafeteria food.<br />\nFrankly, it makes us sick.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "1.1ct.<br /><br />\n11111<br /><br />\nVOLUME 82, NUMBER 6<br /><br />\nOCTOBER?, 1977<br /><br />\nME-<br /><br />\n!Pornography<br />\nSociety<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIto Form<br /><br />\n.7+.7<br /><br />\nPeabody<br />\nApproves<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022111<br /><br />\ni McLuhan at Shriver<br /><br />\nF.<br />\nF.<br />\nBY EDWARD BAST<br />\nE<br />\nPeabody students=<br />\n=<br />\nThe Milton S.

Well, mass<br />\nmasturbation would be in poor taste (esincially in this<br />\nweather), but an increase in the purchases of skin mags at<br />\nthe Union Desk would be the sort of thing that would<br />\nmake the Council members stand up and take notice. \u2022<br />\nShould the Council turn against the student opinion,<br />\nand nay-say the potential Pornographers, students should<br />\nthen attempt to find their filth through other channels. We<br />\nat the News-Letter will do our part, by publishing a<br />\nqerialised account of the love lives of various Council<br />\nfunctionaries (although HOPSFA adamantly maintains<br />\nthat such material lies in their domain). One would expect<br />\nthat the Hopkins Band will take up the practice of playing<br />\nlewd music, and the Bicycle club will take its members<br />\nthroughout the campus on bikes, shouting obscenities.<br />\nAfter all, if the channels already exist, why not use<br />\nthem?<br /><br />\nPeabody<br />\nHey, Peabody: don'cha nate it when some dummy from<br />\nHopkins writes up your events, getting everything wrong?

We're anxious to see ya...<br /><br />\nThe gays have stormed out of the closet and into<br />\nthe streets, bowling over some misbegotten and<br />\nhard-hatted persecutions, but no amount of rhetoric<br />\nabout their liberation will culturally normalize<br />\nhomosexuality. If anything, within the next decade<br />\nor so, their rhetoric and activism will inspire an<br />\n(unfortunately) authoritarian backlash in a culture<br />\nthat grows weary of moral disorder. This is because<br />\nthere is such a thing as human nature, and to the<br />\nbest of our common-sense knowledge its moral recalcitrance to homosexuality is inexpungable.<br />\nThis recalcitrance is certainly not going to be<br />\nexpunged by the sort of arguments that have been<br />\nlaunched in the gay's defense so far. Arguments to<br />\nthe effect that homosexuality is a natural expression<br />\n(countering the assumption that it is \"unnatural\")<br />\nare hopeless. This is because our concept of the<br />\nnatural is too vague to establish standards by which<br />\nthe natural and the unnatural, as such, could be<br />\ndistinguished. But, of course, this also means that<br />\narguments condemning homosexuality as unnatural<br />\nare just as hopeless. Basically, we decide what is<br />\nnatural on an inductive basis, in which case<br />\nhomosexuals seem to get an essentially negative<br />\nbilling. Still, the homosexual may advance theses<br />\nappealing to the artifice of social repression and<br />\nevolutionary advance to explain, respectively, the<br />\nfact that gays and bisexuals are a minority and that<br />\nthey exist. Otherwise, the homosexual may<br />\nexplicitly reject naturalness as a necessary condition<br />\nof goodness. If he were to do so I think he would be<br />\ncorrect., but then he would find himself out of step<br />\nwith a culture that puts its very highest premium on<br />\n\"naturality.\" But this premium is surely to be<br />\nrejected as nonsense, for much goodness involves<br />\nartifice, marriage for example. But clearly, there is<br />\nno absolutely decisive case for the naturality of<br />\nhomosexuality any more than there is such a case<br />\nfor its unnaturalness.<br />\nAppeals to \"latent tendency\", for example, do<br />\nnot successfully naturalize gayness any more than<br />\nsuch appeals could naturalize (read: justify)<br />\ncleptomania. Indeed, someone might claim that he<br />\nhas a \"latent tendency\", to oppress homosexuals. It<br />\nis easy to see that the concept of latent tendency is<br />\nas vague as the concept of naturality and that it is<br />\nconsequently useless as a justification device.<br />\nSo it is that, in spite of the impossiblity of<br />\nproving the thesis that homosexuality is not natural,<br />\npeople, generally speaking (and in spite of liberal<br />\nrhetoric at parties), cannot be convinced that it is<br />\nnatural. In any event, they cannot be convinced that<br />\nit is good. Homosexuality has always been with us<br />\n(in the closet) and it has always been regarded as<br />\nmorally problematic, and it probably always will be.<br />\nThis fact cannot be explained, or rejected in terms<br />\nof some rationally constructed morality. (Indeed,<br />\nthe attempt to consteuct a rational morality is<br />\nfarcical.)<br />\nThe stigmatic character of homosexuality is<br />\nirreducible, and any common sensically practical<br />\napproach to it will have to face up to this. No<br />\nmatter now frustratingly mysterious, the moral<br />\nrejection of homosexuality is not about to be<br />\nrooted out of human nature by any amount of<br />\nmarches, or speeches or political activism.<br />\nWhy has a massive campaign to normalize<br />\nhomosexuality (or for that matter, heterosexual<br />\nperversions) been launched in the first place?<br />\nBecause the homosexual believes in the naturalistic<br />\nideologists dating back to Rousseau. that his sense<br />\nof alienation, shame, and/or guilt, is rooted in<br />\nconventional cultural attitudes rather than<br />\nsomething as immovable as human nature itself. He<br />\nsays as much. He feels that if he can change the<br /><br />\nconventions as such\u2014which would be malleable as<br />\nconventions\u2014he can relieve his personal psychology.<br />\nTo be sure, the moral consensus of the community<br />\nweighs on any individual whose behavior falls<br />\noutside of it, but that consensus may itself be an<br />\nexpression of anthropologically endemic moral<br />\nattitudes. Hence, it is conceivable that the<br />\nhomosexual could extablish a merely conventional<br />\nsocial acceptance for himself and still be plagued by<br />\nendemic psychological problems.<br />\nAll in all, the alteration of the public response to<br />\nhomosexuality seems a poor practical strategy if this<br />\nis meant to resolve the homosexual's relevant<br />\npsychological difficulties as a whole.(The heart of<br />\nhis problem may, after all, be the massive<br />\nbreakdown of heterosexual romance. Too many<br />\npeople are seeking meaningless independence and<br />\n\"freedom\" instead of the challenges of real love and<br />\ncommitment.)<br />\nIn any event, if the attainment of the gay's<br />\ncommunity's goals within the realm of public policy<br />\ndoes not, in fact, relieve all individual homosexuals<br />\nof the relevant psychological difficulties, then those<br />\nwho are not relieved will find that the honest, and<br />\ntruly practical strategy, has altered dramatically. It<br />\nwill amount to the individual's private search for<br />\nsalvation from homosexuality. But here he is left in<br />\nthe lurch not only by the contemporary breakdown<br />\nof hetero sexual romance but by modern<br />\npsychology which is engaged all too often in the<br />\npractically vacuous project of trying to convince<br />\ndisturbed people that there is nothing to be<br />\ndisturbed about and that therefore they ought not<br />\nbedisturbed. Nevertheless, they remain disturbed.<br />\nThis reassurance strategy is the psychological.<br />\nbranch of a larger existential strategy which is an<br />\nattempt to do away with the whole concept of the<br />\nimmoral. That is, modern man, having no recourse<br />\nto re ligious grace, finds himself in a situation<br />\nwhere he can only attack guilt and shame as the<br />\nartifice of unwanted and unnecessary ideas like \"thimmoral.\" The attempt to destigmatize<br />\nhomosexuality (or for that m.tter heterosexual<br />\npromiscuity) is a sub-strategy within this larger<br />\nstrategy. We can see how hopeless this sub-strategy<br />\nis when we re cognize the hopelessness of the larger<br />\nstrategy it is a part of. Obviously we cannot rid<br />\nourselves of the concept of the immoral, nor is<br />\ndoing so in any way practical; not only would<br />\nwidespread moral despair remain with us, mayhem<br />\nwould break out..<br />\nModern man, for all his technology, is<br />\n_pathetically impractical in all of the really<br />\nimportant respects (the psychological ones). In an<br />\nage of rampant ideology he has lost his common<br />\nsense in almost every way that is is genuinely<br />\npossible to<br />\nhe attempts to pop-psychologize<br />\nand politicize himself into happiness. But practical<br />\nnecessity may driv e him b,.ck to common sense- to<br />\nintuitiv e m orality as opposed to activities that<br />\ncon flict. with it and corresponding (hopeless)<br />\nideologies of reassurance. The rejection of the<br />\nconcept of the immoral can only go so far before it<br />\ndestroys the liberal culture it is meant to insure.<br />\nTolerance itself is a moral obligation. With the,<br />\nperhaps, inevitable revival in force of the concept of<br />\nthe immoral and the recovery of moral sensitivity<br />\nper se, we may begin to see that homosexuals have<br />\nbeen hypocritically char acterized as one of the<br />\nforemost symptoms of decadence. We will see that<br />\nmany forms of visciousness have been hiding in the<br />\nsupposed hetero sexual \"healthiness\"-for example.<br />\nthe businessman who is more loyal to the fast buck<br />\nthan he is to his wife and kids.

Pfeffer. Dr.<br />\nPfeffer teaches in the<br />\nDepartment of Political Science<br />\non Modern China and<br />\nContemporary American<br />\nCapitalism. The present<br />\ncontroversy over Dr. Pfeffer<br />\narose last spring aftef he was<br />\ndenied a recommendation for<br />\ntenure by the Political Science<br />\nDepartment. Dr. Pfeffer next<br />\nrequested that the Academic<br />\nCouncil create an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to investigate whether<br />\nhis scholarship merited a tenured<br />\nPosition at the University.<br />\nDespite the support of scholars<br />\noutside the University and<br />\napproximately five hundred<br />\nstudents, the request for an<br />\ninvestigation of Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nwork was denied late last May.<br />\nSince the beginning of this<br />\nsemester, sentiment has been<br />\ngrowing<br />\nthroughout the<br />\nUniversity for the Academic<br />\nCouncil to reconsider its positon<br />\nof last May.

Dr. Benton's position<br />\nwas phased out during last<br />\nsummer's administrative<br />\nreorganization. Since Ms.<br />\nKoenigsberg did not have<br />\nsufficient time last year to permit<br />\nher to accomplish much, the<br />\nStudent Council allowed her to<br />\nbe appointed directly to the<br />\nDenton assistantship without<br />\nundergoing the selection process<br />\na second time.<br />\nMr. Denton described her<br />\nposition as a \"formal liason with<br />\nthe Student Council.\" He praised<br />\nthe creation of the assistantship.<br />\n\"It's important for us to have<br />\nstudent input.\"<br />\nAccording to Ms. Koenigsberg,<br />\nher duties include attendance of<br />\n!Student Council meetings,<br />\nsu rveyance of literature going out<br />\nof Mr. Denton's office, and<br />\nparticipation as a non-voting<br />\nmember of the Academic<br />\nServices Committee.<br />\n\"Most of my work will go with<br />\nDenton,\" she commented, \"and<br />\nsome with Provost Longaker, if<br />\nthere's anything the students<br />\nwould like conveyed to him.\"<br />\nThe assistantship to Dr.<br />\nBenton formerly carried<br />\nwork-study pay. Ms. Koenigsberg<br />\nnoted that the work-study status<br />\nof the Denton job is \"still up in<br />\nthe air.\" The holder of the<br />\nassistantship is credited with 15<br />\nhours per week.<br />\nMs. Koenigsberg singled out a<br />\nproposed 90 page text on the<br /><br />\nHumanities as a first step of her<br />\ngoal of improving the humanistic<br />\nstudy areas here.\"I am interested<br />\nin seeing if we couldn't direct-the<br />\npitch to the Humanities<br />\nstudent,\" she said. \"If I was<br />\napplying and going on a tour of<br />\nthe campus, it would turn me off<br />\nif Remsen and Mergenthaler were<br />\npointed out as the buildings I<br />\nwould be primarily<br />\nconcerned with\"<br />\n\"An\u2022 effort should be<br />\nmade to encourage Humanities<br />\nand Social and Behavioral<br />\nScience majors,\" she continued.<br />\n\"I don't think that should<br />\ndetract from the excellence of<br />\nthe sciences at Hopkins.

There are those who dance in record stores,<br />\nmaking quiet little steps to the ubiquitous pop beat as<br />\nthey rummage through bins of Bee Gee albums; there are<br />\nthose who dutifully hustle or fox-trot their way through a<br />\ndance so as not to seem out of step with their peers.<br />\nThere are those who dance like pros, and there are those<br />\nwho can barely stand straight on their feet.<br />\nAnd then there is the ballet. It's hard to place ballet<br />\non the same level as these other dances, just as it seems<br />\nIncomprehensible to say that Julian Bream and the kid<br />\ndown the street with a Telecaster are doing the same<br />\nthing. But dance is dance, and despite the radical<br />\ndifference between its levels, arnny dancers see each level<br />\nas being as worthwhile as the others. Or at least that's<br />\nWhat we gathered from the few dancers we spoke with,<br />\nafter the opening of this year's Maryland Ballet season.<br />\nTo start at the beginning, upon receiving an invitation<br />\nto the ballet, we were eager to go, but rather hesitant to<br />\nreview; after all, we could find no one on our staff who<br />\nPretended to know anything about the dance. Thus,<br />\nfiguring that a film critic and an music critic would put us<br />\nsomewhere near the desired target, we packed ourselves<br />\nInto an awaiting vehicle, and set out in the general<br />\ndirection of the Lyric Theatre.<br />\nUpon arrival, the music critic noticed that there was no<br />\norchestra, merely speakers. A common practice among<br />\nsmaller companieS, as an entire orchestra would be<br />\nProhibitively expensive for any but the largest of the<br />\nlarge. (Afterwards, one of the dancers told us that she<br />\n?referred dancing to recorded music ratherthan live.<br />\nWhen you're standing on stage, all you can hear is one<br />\nPart of the orchestra. On one side it's just horns, on<br />\nanother side it's just strings. It's much more difficult; you<br />\nreally have to count everything out.\"<br />\nAlthough the music critic found that the sound of<br />\nbroadcast recorded music to be gratingly artificial, he had<br />\nto admit that the dancing usually distracted his attention<br />\nfrom such minor irritaiions. The film critic merely wished<br />\nthat someone in the tech crew had checked the levels<br />\nfirst, so that the onrush of recorded fanfare was not so<br />\nJarring.<br />\nWith the fanfare, though, came the dancers, and with<br />\nthem came our expectations. What would we see? What<br />\nwould they do? The first tableaux was entitled Pas de<br />\nTrois Royale and it was a strictly classical dance. A strong<br />\nsense of form, of style was evident throughout, and had<br />\nwe. any training, we probably could have recognized<br />\nvarious standard dance actions.<br />\nAs it was, though, we merely notic d the solos, duos,<br />\nand trios in the performance. The sense of movement was<br />\nstunning, we amateurs were, on the whole, impressed.<br />\nThe second work was a modern piece, entitled<br />\nBelong:, It was a duet between principals Sylvester<br />\nCamben and<br />\nCamille Izard. A formless, fluid, physical<br />\nrhapsody, the dancers began lying in a prone position on<br />\nstage, danced, and finished in nearly the same position.<br />\nAs with the first dance, \"Belong\" had no ostensible<br />\nPiot, at least not in the standard story-line sense. Yet<br />\nth<br />\ne re was a<br />\nuniting emotional strain, a single flow of ideas<br />\nand. feelings which were visually whispered to the<br />\naudience. Like the resonance of poetic allusion, one heard<br />\nWhat was said with out actually realizing that it was being<br />\nsaid<br />\nIf the beauty of feeling could be adequately translated<br />\nt\u00b0 Physical activity, \"Belong\" would approximated that<br /><br />\ntranslation. Both dancers, and particularly Campbell,<br />\nexhibited a sensuality that transcended the puerile limits<br />\nof eroticism, reaching an esthetic plane that was at once<br />\nmodest and decadent.<br />\nFollowing \"Belong\" there was an intermission, and<br />\nthen the major piece of the evening \"Sebastian.\" It was<br />\nthe only work on the program which was totally<br />\nplot-oriented, and also the only one with music written<br />\nexpressly for the action. But as in a play, although the<br />\ntext remains standard, the setting changes from director<br />\nto director;<br />\nand \"Sebastina,\" as choreographed by John Butler, had<br />\nan identity of its own, independent of other<br />\ninterpertations.<br />\nThe plot is rather simple. The prince falls in love with a<br />\nbeautiful courtesan; his possessive sisters oppose the<br />\nunion. Sebastian, a Moorish slave of the royal family,<br />\nloves the courtesan, and, when he sees that the sisters are<br />\nkilling the courtesan through black magic, lie substitutes<br />\nhimself for the wax effigy of the courtesan, suffering<br />\ndeath at the arrows intended for his forbidden love, and<br />\nthus Essential in the development of the plot is, of<br />\ncourse, the character of Sebastian, and the responsibility<br />\nwas borne expertly by Mr. Campbell. In the character of<br />\nSebastian, one finds echoes of Petroushka (echoed to an<br />\nextent in the score) and commedia del'arte; the title is, of<br /><br />\nnights<br />\nat the<br />\nballet<br />\ncourse, an allusion to the Martyrdom of St. Sebastian<br />\nElements of all this are picked up in the brilliant,<br />\nempathetic performance of Mr. Campbell.<br />\nCarrying himself with a sense of graceful restraint, his<br />\nmovements implied a force he dared not express. While<br />\nthe courtesan writhed in pain, victim of the black magic<br />\narrows, Sebastian reached out with compassion, with a<br />\nyearning to help that touched her in a way more<br />\nsignificant than the physical contact he was denied by<br />\ncaste. Sylvester Campbell moved eloquently, expressing in<br />\nsheer motion intricacies of desire that words could never<br />\ntouch.<br />\nOther characters were good; Ion Florin Scarlat was<br />\nsuitably statel4 as the Prince, Mary McGaw-Miller and<br />\nNorma Pera convincingly cold as his sisters. Camille Izard,<br />\nwho seems to be recognized as an ideal foil for Mr.<br />\nCampbell, was sinuously seductive as the courtesan, while<br />\nregaining as sense of compassion for Sebastian;<br />\ncompassion, alas, that seemed tempered by her even<br />\ngreater love for the Prince.<br />\nBoth the film critic and the music critic nave little or<br />\nno idea how much credit is due the choreographer as<br />\nopposed the dancers; however, we were told by various<br />\nmembers of the company that John Butler was an<br />\nunqualified genius, who,as one member put it, \"expected<br />\nnothing but the best, and got nothing but willing<br /><br />\nassistance.\" There were some brilliant moments of<br />\ndancing by the company in the background of this piece;<br />\nneither of us could grasp the specific symbolism involved,<br />\nbut it seemed evident that the set dancing, like the<br />\nabstract scenery, carried some structural signifigance.<br />\nOne needn't be a member of the cognoscenti to be in<br />\nawe of a moving performance, however, and both the<br />\nmusic critic and the film critic had to admit that they<br />\nwere moved.\"Modern Dance,\" said the film critic,\"seems<br />\nto be their strong point.\" The music critic nodded in<br />\nnumbedassention.<br />\nAgain an intermission, and then the last piece,<br />\n\"Napoli.\" A classical ballet, it was by far the most<br />\nclassical number on the programming, as the program<br />\nnotes assured we novices that the choreography was by<br />\nAugust Bournonville, who originally choreographed the<br />\n1842 premiere. \"The form of the ballet has been retained<br />\nfor the present production.\"<br />\nThe basic mode of \"Napoli\" is that of a terpsichorean<br />\njam session, where each of the ten dancers is given the<br />\nopportunity to \"show his stuff,\" in a solo or duo<br />\nperformance. With dancers leaping, twirling and almost<br />\nfloating across the stage, the visual extravagance more<br />\nthan made up for the melodic paucity of the music. Linda<br />\nKintz was especially notable for her omnipresent smile<br />\nand exhausting exhuberance.<br />\nAfterwards, after a winding drive through Mount<br />\nVernon, the two dance-saturated critics found their way<br />\nto a\"recepting\" at a disco called Casablanca. Casablanca is<br />\none of those deceptively glossy establishments, filled with<br />\nmen whose hair is self-consciously styled, and women<br />\nwho attempt to dress out of Vougue with a Mademoiselle<br />\nbudget and sense of aesthetics. Remarked one critic to the<br />\nother, \"I had always suspected these people existed, but I<br />\nnever knew where...\"<br />\nLeaving the upstairs disco, our budding interviewers<br />\nstood downstairs near the bar, in wait for dancers.<br />\nFinally, they arrived, and we approached, unfortunately<br />\nwithout questions. They kindly tolerated our gaffe, and<br />\nasked us, \"this was your first ballet? Did you leave<br />\nsmiling?\" The joy of dance was foremost on their minds.<br />\nFinally happening on a darker who wasn't too<br />\nexhausted to be bothered (one felt guilty pestering<br />\nprincipals), we managed a coherent line of questioning.<br />\nHad she been dancing long? \"Ever since I was ten. 1 used<br />\nto move to music, and my mother said, 'Get this ked to<br />\ndancing class!\"<br />\nMusic to her meant dance. \"I can't imagine people just<br />\nsitting when they play music; that's why I have trouble<br />\nwith concerts. That's why I could never play an<br />\ninstrument. I thought about taking piano, but it's a little<br />\ntoo stationary...<br />\n\"I think it's great that more and more people are going<br />\nto the ballet. I love it...there are days when I get up, and I<br />\njust can't believe that I'm making a living at what lenjoy.<br />\nI mean, it's a lot of work, but it's never been a job... It's<br />\ngreat!\"<br />\nWell, we critics must admit that it was fun, although it<br />\nwill be a while before either of us will become full-fledged<br />\nafficianados. Dance takes time to get used to, but it's<br />\ncertainly time well-spent. The Maryland Ballet's next<br />\nperformance is in two weeks, at Goucher. If you have ever<br />\nmarvelled at the beauty of the human form, or at the<br />\ngrace of an athelete, perhaps you might like tile dance.

Her name appears above<br />\nthe film title on the Playhouse Theater's marquee, but<br />\nFaustina is no more than a vehicle for Adjani titan Birth<br />\nofa Nation was for Raoul Walsh.<br />\nThe real subject of the film, Faustine, is played by<br />\nactress Muriel Catala. Although other characters, Isabella<br />\nAdjani among them, influence the outcome of the film, it<br />\nis primarily concerned with Faustine's observations of<br />\nthose characters and of herself.<br />\nAn opening, pre-credit sequence, in which Faustine has<br />\na conversation with herself, is important to an<br />\nunderstanding of the film, because it makes clear to the<br />\nviewer, from the very beginning, that all conversation or<br />\naction in the film is only important insofar as it concerns<br />\nFaustine. That is quite a burden for any actress,to bear,<br />\nand while Catala seems capable, the role she plays is not<br />\nsufficiently well-developed. In other words, she is a main<br />\ncharacter without much character.<br />\nFaustine, a schoolgirl, around 16 years of age, spends<br />\nher summer vacation in the country with her<br />\ngrandparents, something she has not done since the age of<br />\ntwelve. As one might expect, the grandparents are little<br />\nmore than fixtures in the house, and even the house itself<br />\nis of no real concern to Campaneez, because Faustine'<br />\npends most of her time wandering in the fields, hugging<br />\nand caressing the stalks of grain, and looking quite<br />\nsensuous.<br />\nShe is an adolescent, but on the verge of maturity, and<br />\nthe film's real concern is with how this young girl matures<br />\nduring a summer vacation. That may not be a terribly<br />\noriginal or profound theme, but it could be interesting,<br />\nespecially if, through insightful acting and screenwriting,<br />\nthe audience could perceive the progressive maturation of<br /><br />\nthe main character. In Faustine, unfortunately, there are<br />\nnot enough scenes revealing the psychology of Faustine<br />\nand too many scenes emphasizing the sensuous physical<br />\nworld around her.<br />\nIn an early scene, for instance, Faustine lies on the<br />\ngrass, watching two bathers, one of them nude. Variations<br />\non this scene recur throughout the film, because Faustine<br />\nis constantly on the outside, detached from the action<br />\n,<br />\nobserving the domestic and amorous lives of others<br />\n. The<br />\nothers, in this case, are a neighboring family, of which<br />\nAdjani is a member, whose summer existence, like<br />\nFaustine's, is a leisurely series of night walks through the.<br />\nwoods, tea breaks on the terrace, and swims in the lake.<br />\nCampaneez, apparently not content with merely<br />\nfilming Faustine as an adolescent on the outside of an<br />\nadult world, makes an embarrassingly heavy handed<br />\nattempt to symbolically emphasize Faustine's position.<br />\nWhen Faustine watches her neighbors she is often on the<br />\noutside of their blue garden fence, and at one point she<br />\nsays to herself, \"The door is blue that opens on the<br />\nworld.\" As one might expect, when Faustine finally does<br />\nmature, i.e. when she is no longer an observer of lovers<br />\nbut a lover herself, the final lines of the film tell us: \"And<br />\nfinally Faustine went through that blue door.\" Now,it is<br />\nhighly likely that an adolescent girl like Faustine, enrolled<br />\nin Symbolism 101, would create a mental landscape<br />\nof blue doors and fences, but the doors and fences really<br />\nare intensely blue, leading one to conclude that not<br />\nFaustine alone, but Campaneez as well, is enrolled in an<br />\nelementary course where symbolism is always spelled with<br />\na capital S.<br />\nkin even more irritating flaw, because it is present in<br />\nnearly every scene, is that Campaneez continually reminds<br />\nus, through sound and image, of how wonderfully<br />\nsensuous and beautiful it is to live and love in the<br />\ncountry. Many scenes do have a natural, seductive beauty,<br /><br />\nbut the beauty of other scenes is artificial, contrived: yo,<br />\ncan bet your bottom dollar that if Faustine, dresse<br />\ndI<br />\npink, wanders through a rose garden, the roses will also b,<br />\npink. There are scenes where a real sense<br />\nof passional(<br />\nlovemaking on the forest floor is conveyed,<br />\nbut too ofter<br />\nCampaneez slips into the banal cliches of splend<br />\nor in tht<br />\ngrass you can bet another bottom dollar that when the<br />\nhands of lovers touch it is filmed with close- shots, it<br />\nup<br />\nwhat seems to be slow motion.<br />\nThen there is the music, a virtual romantic torrent<br />\nof<br />\npiano music by Chopin, Lizst, and Tchaikovsky among<br />\nothers. Sometimes it is generated from within the scene.<br />\nwhen a character sits down at the piano and plays little<br />\na<br />\natmosphere, but usually, when Faustine<br />\nis walking<br />\nthrough the forest, it comes from the heavens and fills the<br />\nsoundtrack. There is nothing wrong with Campaneez's<br />\nselection of music, for it often does provid aural<br />\ne<br />\nsensations which complement the physical landsc<br />\nape<br />\naround Faustine and the emotional landsc<br />\nape within het.<br />\nThe problem is that Campaneez does not know<br />\nwhen to<br />\ntake the needle off the record.<br />\nFaustine has spent most of her summer observing the<br />\nlives of others, rejecting all suitors, and dreami<br />\nng of a<br />\nromantic love for herself: there is at least one sequence<br />\nin<br />\nthe film in which Faustine, hugging herself<br />\n, imagines that<br />\nit is a man hugging her. \"I've always<br />\ndreamed a lot and<br />\nI'm afraid to face reality,\" says Faustine of<br />\nher life, but<br />\nwhen she does love a man at tne end, and goes throug<br />\nh<br />\nher symbolic blue door with him, one gets the impression<br />\nnot so much that Faustine has replaced<br />\ndreams of love<br />\nwith real love, but that dreams of love have<br />\nbeen replaced<br />\nby a dreamy love.<br />\nWhen Faustine returns to school in the fall, hopefully<br />\nat an urban institution, perhaps enrollment in an intensive<br />\ncourse in Italian neorealism will teach her that most<br />\ndoors are brown.<br /><br />\n:77trt<br /><br />\nYou probably think all those Judy<br />\nGarland and<br />\nMickey Rooney movies are all a lot of bunk.<br />\nI mean, who<br />\ncan ever believe such a flimsy premise<br />\nas two lovesick<br />\ncollege kids turningto each other and saying<br />\n, \"Gee, why<br />\ndon't we put on a play?\" Sounds corny?<br />\nWell, such corn<br />\nis husked every October when The<br />\nBarnstormers band<br />\ntogether to present The Freshman One-Acts,<br />\na theatrical<br />\ncollage designed to initiate freshmen to the<br />\nfootlights of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"Magic to Do,\" this year's freshmen<br />\nfollies, will be<br />\npresented tonight and Saturday at eight<br />\np.m. in the<br />\nListening Viewing Room of the Hopkins<br />\nUnion.

They exuded a state of total<br />\nconcentration that has been long absent from the Hopkins<br />\nstage.<br />\nNext best on the program was Susan F. Obrecht's<br />\nadaptation of the Woody Allen short story, \"The Whore<br />\nof Mensa.\" The plot can best be summarized as a dual<br />\nparody of pulp detective stories and<br />\nprostitute-with-a-golden-heart fables. Josiah Gluck plays<br />\nKaiser Lupowitz,the gumshoe, a bit too fast and campy.<br />\nOn the other hand, Kelliann Hess plays Sherry, the<br />\nslattern who stimulates intellectually horny men's minds<br />\nwith discussions of Herman Melville, with just the right<br />\ntouch of cerebral raciness.<br />\nMichael Bannon sensitively plays a corpse who comes<br />\nbriefly back to life in \"A Soul ComeHome.\" Killed by<br />\ncomplications following TB and malnutrition, Mr. Bannon<br />\nrises from the dead to berate his mother (Daphne<br />\nGolding) for her fatal neglect of him. This segment is<br />\nhindered by an overly heavy ending which is more the<br /><br />\nplaywright's fault than anyone else's. Celeste Yousoof<br />\nhas adapted and directed selections from Shakespeare in<br />\nan act called \"Shakespearian Lovers\" This segment is<br />\na bit<br />\ntoo long, and could be cut in places, but the enthusiasm<br />\ngenerated by the cast carries the interest. Bruce Nib, Bill<br />\nOberle, Lisa Gottesfeld, Susan Obrecht, Eric Schum<br />\nacher,<br />\nElizabeth Unger, and Robert O'Rourke all do,<br />\nwell in their<br />\ndifficult roles as Shakespearian stooges.<br />\nThe two musical numbers,\"Magic to Do\" from \"Pipin<br />\n\"<br />\nand \"Aquarius\" from \"Hair\", are the opening<br />\nand closing<br />\nacts of the evening.

An acquaintance of mine who<br />\ngot \"lucky\" and \"won\"<br />\na space in the Alumni Memorial<br />\nResidences for his sophomore year inquired, with straight<br />\nface yet: \"Don't you<br />\never miss living in the dorms?\"<br />\nDoubled over with laughter, my first reaction was to pity<br />\nthe poor deluded<br />\nsoul. Jealousy of his off-campus<br />\nclassmates, I reasoned, had snapped his mind.<br />\nThe incident was good for half a dozen more chuckles<br />\nbetween there and my apartment, but it also prompted<br />\nme to recall events and feelings<br />\nthat had gathered a<br />\nconsiderable coating of dust over the summer. Of course I<br />\nknew that my<br />\npresent physical situation was far and away<br />\nbetter than it was as a freshman but had my friends and<br />\ntraded something much more valuable for the relative<br />\nopulence of off-campus life? What of camaraderie? Wasn't<br />\nthat feeling of<br />\nbeing fellow travellers, fellow inmates if<br />\nYou will, more important than hot water in the morning?<br />\nClearly, it was time for some no-nonsense comparisons to<br />\nbe made.<br />\nSo, accordingly, I have comprised the following<br />\nchecklist of conditions now and then, taking great pains<br />\nto be at all times fair<br />\nand impartial.<br />\nFood: As my roommate Dixie Dick always says, the<br />\nOnly good thing we got out of Servomation was a<br />\nmediocre set of china. Yes, the place settings are the<br />\nsame, but now instead of labouring under piles of runny<br />\ncasseroles and brick-like desserts, they are gracing such<br />\nculinary delights as glazed ham, cornish game hens, and<br />\ncheese souffle. Where once we waited in driving<br />\nrains to<br />\nget our tickets<br />\npunched, we may now recline, martini and<br />\nP<br />\n. eailuts in hand,<br />\nand savour the robust aroma as it drifts<br />\nin from<br />\nthe kitchen. Never let it be said, however, that we<br />\nwho have<br />\ncome so far have forgotten our roots...once a<br />\nmonth we cook up some<br />\nbeef roulade just for old time's<br />\nsake.<br />\nRomance: No matter how neatly pressed your slacks,<br />\n,i 1\u00b0w smartly combed your hair, how rugged your<br />\nelt-buckle<br />\nor ilairy your chest\u2014the Johns Hopkins<br />\nbfreshman L still<br />\nfacedwith a terrible dilemma Namely, wh _re<br />\nYou must bring<br />\nyour prospective lovemate once you've<br /><br />\ngotten lucky. Whether its a short walk from the Rat or a<br />\nlong drive from Goucher, you and your honey still wind<br />\nup at something considerably less than a lovenest. If the<br />\ngirl has been wavering between yes and no, or if the beer<br />\nis beginning to wear off, then you are almost certainly out<br />\nof luck\u2014for nothing will murder a romantic mood faster<br />\nor more thoroughly than the interior of the freshman<br />\ndorms.<br />\nThe logistics alone are staggering. First of all, there is a<br />\nroommate to deal with. Whether it be through lengthy<br />\nthreats, humiliating pleas, or generou bribes, he must be<br />\nkept away. Even once the agreement is made, you are<br />\nhelpless against a double cross (be it out of malice or<br />\nintoxication, it makes no difference) because he still has<br />\nthat damn key.<br />\nNo matter how sweetly seductive your music, it must<br />\nstill compete with Zappa down the h..11 and Porter<br />\nWagoner on the floor below. No m,tter how tasteful your<br />\nposters and pictures, the peeling plaster and decaying<br />\ncinderblock call to mind nothing so much as a transient<br />\nhotel.<br />\nSpeaking from personal experience, I can definitely say<br />\n,that it is most difficult to convince the girl of your<br />\nsincerity and high intentions with a lacrosse ball keeping<br />\n3/4 time on the wall and a farting contest going full tilt<br />\noutside your door.<br />\nAnd this year? Oh, picture it if you will. After being<br />\nsuitably impressed with the gracious doorman and<br />\nspacious lobby, she is witisked upstairs, where, high above<br />\nthe teeming squalor of tile city, a Sealy Posturepedic<br />\nwaits amid the lilting strains of Burt Bacharach and<br />\nsuggestive Renoir prints.<br />\nRoommates: One of the more obvious pitfalls of the<br />\nfreshman year is the creature on the opposite bunk whom<br />\nfate and faceless computer have thrust indelicately into<br />\nyour life. If you are one of the lucky few who got<br />\nsomeone tolerable, my congratulations. For the most<br />\npart, however, letters to home from freshmen are filled<br />\nwith horror stories of the roommate who fails to bathe,<br />\ntinkers with chicken entrails, masturbates indiscretely, or<br />\na hundred other habits so loathsome and disgusting that<br />\nthey would turn the stomach of even the most hardened<br />\nslaughterhouse employee. This i not to say that my<br /><br />\nroommates this year (roommates of my own choosing)<br />\nare devoid of irritating eccentricities. They aren't, but at<br />\nleast they are the kind that mesh nicely with mine. For<br />\ninstance: Dixie Dick takes entirely too long in the<br />\nbathroom\u2014but his lengthy primping and grooming does<br />\nallow me adequate time to satisfy my burning lust for his<br />\naquamarine Samsonite tote bag in relative privacy.<br />\nPersonal Hygiene: Two toilets for twenty-four people<br />\nwas always a little risky, but I recall one morning after a<br />\nServomation South-of-the-Border festive night when the<br />\nsituation became critical to say the least. Sinks without<br />\ntaps may be all the rage as objets d'art, but have little<br />\npractical value when one is attempting to wet a<br />\ntoothbrush. Showers with alternately numbing cold and<br />\nscalding hot water are no doubt still in use in the mental<br />\ninstitutions of backward nations, but I am confident that<br />\nfreshmen can do without them. About halfway through<br />\nsecond semester the only mirror in our bathroom was<br />\nsmashed, which forced us to employ a jagged fragment<br />\npropped up by a rock for the rest of the year. The<br />\nresulting feeling of \"roughing it'? was more ai.in to<br />\nGilligan's Island than Robinson Crusoe .<br />\nNowadays, things are different. Shag carpeting<br />\nsurrounds my tender toes, warm water drenches my skin.<br />\nNo longer do I mistakenly squeeze someone else's zit<br />\ncream on my toothbrush in a crowded morning haze. The<br />\nmorning after a debauch, I have only my own corpse-like<br />\nface to stare at, only my own spills to avoid, and only my<br />\nown puke to clean up.<br />\nSpirit: To be sure, the dorms do serve a purpose.

Maybe this is due to the<br />\nimage of sports not only at JHU,<br />\nbut at all colleges.<br />\nThe traditional image of the<br />\nfootball or lacrosse player,<br />\nwhether well-founded or not,<br />\nscares away many a potential<br />\nathlete. Well, the sport that<br />\nmight appeal to more than the<br />\nbusinessman in one extreme, or<br />\nthe quarterback on the other, has<br />\nbeen at Hopkins all along.<br />\nGolf may be just the sport to<br />\nsupport if not become involved<br />\nin. Pat Caruso, Captain, a junior<br />\nfrom Scotch Plains, New Jersey,<br />\ndescribes the game of golf as a<br />\ntotally mental sport. \"Most of<br />\nthe game is mental, not only in<br />\nthe strategy needed to play, but<br />\nalso in the self-control needed.\"<br />\nBut, onc,e again, athletics at<br />\nHopkins is forced to compete<br />\nwith everything else, including<br />\nthe academic pressures. \"It's a<br />\nproblem to nave good golf at<br />\nHopkins. It's hard to be able to<br />\nchuck the pressures once you get<br />\nout there playing. I have no<br />\npatience for someone who can't<br />\ncontrol his temper on the golf<br />\ncourse. You have to keep<br />\nyourself together mentally.\"<br />\nThere are sports like football,<br /><br />\nlacrosse, and perhaps even<br />\ncross-country, that allow<br />\nstudents to release their tensions<br />\nin a somewhat healthy<br />\nenvironment. G-olf, though, only<br />\nrequires increased concentration<br />\nand self-control. Caruso feels that<br />\nthis is where golf becomes totally<br />\nseparate from other athletics.<br />\n\"Football and lacrosse are<br />\ncontact sports. If a person gets<br />\nangry, he can let it out on the<br />\nother players; at least there's<br />\nsome way to let it out. But in<br />\ngolf you can only hit the ball.<br />\nBut again, you can never hit it<br />\nwith that frame of mind; it<br />\nwould be disastrous.\"<br />\nThe benefits of playing golf<br />\noutweigh the image of it as a<br />\nsport designed only for pre-Wall<br />\nStreet majors. \"You have to play<br />\n,to understand. No one who<br />\ndoesn't play will take it seriously.<br />\nIt's a strange sport. So<br />\nfrustrating. You need so much<br />\nself-control to hit a little ball<br />\nwith a clumsy club.\"<br />\nThe prospects for this year's<br />\nspring season look good.

With the advent of mass<br />\ncommunications, the printing press and public museums,<br />\nthe exposure of these artifacts was extended far beyond<br />\nthe confines of their intended audience.

In comparing \"Rose Garden\" to<br />\n\"Cuckoo's Nest\", she stresses the lack of explanation for<br />\nthe actions of the main character Deborah, as well as<br />\nthose of the other patients. It is evident that Ms. Aleiss<br />\nexpresses the ignorance which many laymen have about<br />\nmental illness\u2014especially psychosis, of which<br />\nschizophrenia is but one variety. Ms. Aleiss appears to be<br />\nskeptical that the reason for Deborah's actions could be<br />\nthat a group of fantasized gods order her to do things.<br />\nSchizophrenia is characterized by a loss of the meaning of<br />\nreality. It is quite typical for someone wilo is psychotic to<br />\npursue self-destructive activities such as burning and<br />\ncutting oneself for precisely such reasons, however<br />\nirrational. Does Ms. Aleiss realize that the story is really a<br />\ntrue one based on Hannah Green's (a pseudonym) own<br />\nlife?<br />\n\"Deborah's ...sensationalism lacks explanation\"<br />\nbecause in real life no one knows the answers.

Sort of a contemporary<br />\nPerversion, a bastard son of the har-harring shuckster,<br />\ncomplete with fake hair and grey hush puppies. Barker<br />\nwore a brown sweater and a smug vacuous smirk.<br />\nThe event was the first Chicago Business School LPF,<br />\nor Liquidity Preference Function. A cute name for an<br />\nexcuse to get smashed on beer and wine paid for by a big<br />\nacro-name recruiter like IBM or FMC.<br />\nLPFs are phenomenal events. They begin in timid lines,<br />\nlong skinny trails of quiet people, shyly shaking hands. A<br />\ngood LPF soon bursts into huge raucous gatherings,<br />\nShards of conversation everywhere, men on the, make, the<br />\nrare business school woman wisely drinking ginger ale<br />\nrather than horrible fraternity poison.<br />\nIt shocked and scared me to see people like Winfield<br />\nand Barker in business school. felt fear and loathing.<br />\nI<br />\nIthought I had left these people behind in the reserve<br />\nroom of<br />\nEisenhower.<br />\nSoon the drugs began to take effect and Winfield<br />\nbecame a grotesque smiling suit, a polyester mannequin<br />\nwith a perfectly controlled laugh (part of his<br />\nv ocabulary).<br />\nBarker was transformed into a similar<br />\ncreature; horrid living dummy, always brushing his short<br />\nsandy hair (Establishment hair, as the saying went) back<br />\nfrom his clean freshly shaven<br />\nface.<br />\nIn chemical euphoria, the dozen wenches who pass for<br />\nWomen at Chicago Business became goddesses, queen bees<br />\na dministering to their courts of slobbering future<br />\nexecutives. I whispered to a demented friend,\"Don't tell<br />\nthem, but most of these people are doomed to Middle<br />\nManagement.\"<br />\nHe nodded in agreement. \"Sixty percent.\"<br />\nRecruiters wandered from group to group, drinking<br />\nlightly and evading important questions. One drunken<br />\nstudent grabbed a guy from FMC,a scared refugee from a<br />\nJoseph Heller novel, shoved a beer into his hands and<br />\nbegan to badger him.<br />\n\"Do you have any summer internships?\"<br />\nThe man admitted FMC does not have any summer<br />\nPositions \"at the present time,\" but he assured the<br />\nstudent \"we<br />\nare working on it.\" The kid would have no<br />\nPart of this scam.<br />\nAfter all, he worked for a law firm this<br />\nslimmer.

A<br />\nthird way to the Money River besides inheritance and<br />\nintimidation; business school.<br />\nWhat today's business schools provide is not a diploma.<br />\nAn MBA is a giant passkey to important executive<br />\nwashrooms where people called J.R. by their associates<br />\nhang out, getting psyched for huge three-hour business<br />\nluncheons.<br />\nBut that passkey is no more than a guaranteed spot on<br />\nthe ladder. Simply, in the Beatles' wor ds, a ticket to<br />\nride. Most of Chicago's graduates are doomed to middle<br />\nmanagement, ruts in an entrenched hierarchy. Only a<br />\nhandful of those passkeys will unlock the Big Door. Like<br />\nsome sort of a grey flannel game show...<br />\nToday's business schools are the stepchildren of the<br />\ncultural s hock of the sixties.

Any upperclassman recognized<br />\nit and Southside Johnny's got it on his first album, 'It<br />\nain't the Meat, It's the Motion.\"<br />\nAnd to some extent, college has become like high<br />\nschool in the 50's; the highest level of formal education to<br />\nwhich most aspire. So Hopkins doles out degrees in life<br />\ncompetence, with a few lucky students getting some oldfashioned book larnin' in liberal arts along the way. An<br />\nundergraduate learns to stroke along in life, bides his<br />\ntime, seeks refuge from society for a few years. As Ringo<br />\nsays, \"Gotta pay your dues if you waima sing the blues.\"<br />\nBut business school, especially the Harvard version, is a<br />\nmeeting ground. Here you shake hands and talk to<br />\nrecruiters with million-dollar budgets and get to know<br />\nstudents who will , if there's a placement director in<br />\nheaven, be the shakers and movers of America.<br />\nA final delicious anecdote, a short verbal photograph of<br />\nwhat business school students thought a few years ago<br />\nand still do, with refreshing exceptions. Chicago's<br />\nDirector of Placement speaking:<br />\n\"There's a story I often tell about the guy who stood<br />\nup to the radicals during the Dow (Chemical) era. The<br />\nradicals were out in the business quad, marching and<br />\ntormenting Dow and tormenting the business school. Our<br />\nbusi ness school jocks came out from an LPF clutching<br />\ntheir beer cans; they were all men in those days, or<br />\nostensibly men. A bearded mail from the radical group<br />\nstepped forward like a soloist from a glee club and said<br />\nbeautifully, 'You've got it wrong, old chap. Not run the<br />\nworld; rather, keep it running, and that's a tough<br />\nprofessional job.'\"<br />\nThe radicals? Ostensibiy men? Our bus.ness school<br />\njocks? Glee club? A tough professional job?<br />\nPockets of sanity exist even in Chicago, on corporate<br />\nhunting grounds where sexless, wavy-haired young<br />\nengineers lugging bEiefeases are only too glad to sign with<br />\nIBM or Xerox. There is safety in numbers for most<br />\nb-school boys; words like 'optimal' and 'efficient' can be<br />\nuttered acre without public castigation<br />\nSome talk excitedly of starting their own enterprises<br />\nafter graduation, the true reapers of Whitehead's rewards.<br /><br />\nBut most, like Winfield the Smiling, wLar their status like<br />\nbadges, secure futures neatly decided.

The first point we would like<br />\nto refute is the supposed unwillingness of students to eat<br />\nthe meals. We have seen students wait in line for half an<br />\nhour in breathless anticipation of what delicacy would be<br />\noffered. In other words, they come in green, not leave<br />\ngreen as some subversives would lead us to believe.<br />\nClearly, such sacrifice indicates real commitment.<br />\nAs for the second point, that the food is slightly<br />\ninedible, this is a gross exaggeration. Why, nothing is more<br />\ndelicious in the morning than the tantalizing scent of<br />\nfreshly powdered eggs. Not only does Hopkins food<br />\nprovide the eight essential carbohydrates and starches<br />\nessential for growing bodies, it also presents--adventure!<br />\nOften, students can be found unwinding from a hard<br />\nafternoon of Chem lab, picking through the stew in hot<br />\npursuit of those shrewd little pieces of meat and<br />\nvegetables. And, to top it off, Hopkins meals are creative.<br />\nWhere else could you get pizza, spaghetti, ravioli, stew,<br />\nmeatloaf, Sloppy Joes, and just plain mush from that<br />\nsingle itty, bitty can:<br />\nThe third point is self-evident. Hopkins lacrosse balls<br />\nare not, and never have been, synthesized from leftover<br />\nmeatballs.
