North Point<br />\nPress, 169 pp. S11.50.<br />\n<br />\nThere's an odd, almost<br />\notherworldly quality to Stephen<br />\nDixon's fiction: while it takes<br />\nplace in easily recognizable,<br />\nusually urban settings and involves characters not too much<br />\ndifferent from ourselves or people we know, it's not exactly<br />\nrealism. It's a representation Of<br />\nthe world not as it is but as it<br />\nexists in our consciousnesses,<br />\nwith all the attendant distortion<br />\nsuch intermediacy entails.<br />\nReading Movies, Dixon's new<br />\ncollection of stories, is not quite<br />\nlike dreaming, but it's close.<br />\nA linking motif, the movies,<br />\nsurfaces and submerges<br />\nthrmighout the hook, but a<br />\nmore specific connection<br />\namong the stories is that virtually every one is concerned to<br />\nsome degree with the ways<br />\nvarious types of fictions govern<br />\npeople's lives. Dixon's characters are constantly being bombarded by stories or forced to<br />\nact them out, fabrications of<br />\nlife that function as a scrim<br />\nthrough which tlic characters<br />\nmust view reality. In \"Small<br />\nBear,\" a couple's weekend in a<br />\ncabin in Maine is spent largely<br />\nin their creating tales, of vary<br />\nnig veracity, about a hear that<br />\nmay or may not be loose in the<br />\n<br />\nwoods; the storytelling becomes<br />\nthe primary method whereby<br />\nthe man and woman affect each<br />\nother's emotions. In \"The<br />\nBarbecue\", a group of guests at<br />\na rained-out cookout embellish<br />\ntogether an anecdote one of<br />\nthem has heard; almost all the<br />\nconversation among these people relates in some way to the<br />\nnarration or the truth of the<br />\nanecdote. In \"The Moviemaker,\" a woman calls up her<br />\nformer lover to ask for movie<br />\nrights to his novel, whose subject is their relationship, which<br />\nshe plans to alter to suit her<br />\nown creative needs, reforming<br />\nthe details of the affair into<br />\nsomething more to her liking.<br />\nOther stories deal with extraordinary events occurring in<br />\nordinary lives, so that they take<br />\non the qualities of movies<br />\nthemselves: \"Layaways,\" a<br />\ncautionary talc of urban<br />\nviolence; \"No! Charles,\" a<br />\nhospital drama about the failing health of a couple's<br />\nnewborn baby; \"The Watch.\u2014<br />\na street farce about mistaken<br />\nintentions; \"Cy,'' a sort of<br />\nhorror story reminiscent of<br />\nEraserhead or The Dephani<br />\nMan.<br />\nEach of Dixon's pieces is<br />\ncharacterized by an eccentric,<br />\nstylized form of narration,<br />\nsignaling the reader that he is in<br />\nneither the humdrum world of<br />\nthird- or first-person realism,<br />\n<br />\n. .<br />\nnor some more ethereal world of<br />\nfantasy, but<br />\ndisjointed<br />\nbetween.

D.C. to<br />\nface an improved Gallaudet College squad. A year ago<br />\nthe Blue Jays opened its season with a 108-76 trouncing of Gallaudet and also heat them 104-65 later in the<br />\nyear.<br />\nThis year's Jays should he a much improved team.<br />\nThough the loss of All-MAC foward Gary Beiminghoff from last year's 7-17 squad should hurt, the<br />\nreturn of Nick Nik'c. who was one of the Jays leading<br />\nscorers two seasons ago should add scoring punch.<br />\nAlso, two freshmen, Steve Mitchell and Mike Sohr,<br />\nboth of whom Coach Ed \"Nap\" Doherty expects w ill<br />\nget much playing time, should be key additions to the<br />\nteam.<br />\n.\"The players all worked hard over the summer,\"<br />\nsaid Coach Doherty, \"and they came back much<br />\nimproved. They all returned in good condition and<br />\nhave worked hard in the pre-season.\"<br />\nIn addition to the regular practices, captains Bob<br />\nClayton and Glen Wall have been leading the team in<br />\nextra drills and running afterwards. \"The attitude of<br />\nthe captains and the seniors in general has been great.\"<br />\nnoted Doherty. \"They've really been leading the<br />\nteam.\"<br />\n\"Our first goal is to make the playoffs,\" said the<br />\ncoach. \"The early part of our schedule, with Maryland<br />\nand Virginia Commonwealth is tough, hut once we get<br />\nby those games we should have an opportunity to do<br />\nvery well. The next few games after those against the<br />\nDivision I opponents are key.\" Last year the Jays lost<br />\nten of its first twelve games and never really recovered.<br />\nThe Jays are a tall team, loaded with good shooters.<br />\nCoach Doherty will he stressing ball handling and<br />\ndefense, as these are the areas where he feels the team<br />\ncan improve.<br />\n',We'd like to be a fast-break team, for with our<br />\nheight it would he to our advantage to run.' noted<br />\nCoach Doherty. \"If we're rebounding well, we can<br />\nrelease a man downcourt.\"<br />\nOn defense the Jays will press at certain times, hut,<br />\nsays the coach. \"We won't be a 94-foot team.\"<br />\nHopkins will also primarily employ a man-to-man<br />\ndefense.<br />\nThe Jays schedule is similar to last year's, with only<br />\nfour new opponents. After the opening- Gallaudet<br />\ngame. Hopkins travels to College Park to take on<br />\nnumber eight in the nation Maryland University. Then<br />\nafter facing another new opponent Gettysburg, who<br />\naccording to Doherly had a good recruiting year, the<br />\nJays will play Virginia Commonwealth University.<br />\nVCU is ranked fifteenth in the nation and, according<br />\nto the Hopkins coach, might be the hest team in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nVirginia.<br />\nAfter facing VCU on Dec. I, the .lays will then face<br />\nMary Washington, Lebanon Valley and Cabrini, all<br />\nthree of which defeated Hopkins last year. The Blue<br />\nJay defense really collapsed in these games, giving up<br />\n86, 89. and 88 points. If the .lays play well, these<br />\nshould all be close contests.<br />\n.January 5 and 6 are the dates for the Blue .lay Tournament, which in addition to Hopkins, includes<br />\nWestern Maryland, who heat the Jays 105-74 last Year,<br />\nPhiladelphia Pharmacy, who twice defeated Hopkins<br />\na year ago, and Case Western. It should he a tough,<br />\nexciting tournament.<br />\nthe .lay's other two non-league games are against<br />\nalways-tough Franklin and Marshall and Messiah<br />\nCollege.<br />\nLast year the Jays tied for third in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast division, with a 5-5 record. This year the<br />\nJays should challenge for one of two playoff spots,<br />\nwhich go to the top finishers in the division.<br />\nOnce again the frontrunner has to be Widener, who<br />\nwas undefeated in the league last year. The rest of the<br />\nleague is also tough, and history has shown that teams<br />\nsuch as Haverford, Swarthmore, and Washington College are especially hard to defeat on their home courts.<br />\nThis year's Jays are much improved. They have<br />\ngreater depth and more quickness in their front line.<br />\nIt should he an exciting season.<br />\nIf I had to go out on a limb and make a prediction,<br />\n1 would say that the team should finish second in the<br />\nleague behind Widener, and I expect that they should<br />\nbe able to break above the .5(X) mark. But if e\u2018erything<br />\ncomes together, the Hopkins hoopsters could go ver<br />\nfar.<br />\n<br />\nBob Clayton<br />\nCenter<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'6\", 205<br />\n<br />\nKen Puhalla<br />\nGuard<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'0\", 175<br />\n<br />\nOne of the two captains on the squad, Clayton will<br />\nstart at center for Hopkins. Last year Clayton averaged<br />\n12.2 points per game and 7.0 rebounds. Unfortunate1 , he also fouled out of seven contests. According to<br />\ncoach Doherty, \"Clayton has returned vastly improved. He can now use both hands inside. Nobody works<br />\nharder. But he must stay out of foul trouble.\" Bob<br />\nhas emerged as a real team leader.<br />\n<br />\nKen was an integral part of last year's Hopkins<br />\nteam. He is a good shooting guard with a fine<br />\nknowledge of the game. \"Puhalla is a very coachable<br />\nplayer,\" said Doherty, \"and also a very fine technical<br />\ndefensive player.\" Ken averaged 6.8 points per game<br />\nin the MAC league contests.<br />\n<br />\nRalph Horne<br />\nCenter<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'8\", 202<br />\n<br />\n\"Ralph has improved 1000/0 on offense,\" notes<br />\nDoherty. \"He's much more apt to shoot.\" Horne,<br />\nwho as a freshman averaged 2.5 points per game and<br />\n2.3 rebounds in limited playing time, should he a big<br />\nforce on this year's team. Coach Doherty looks for<br />\nRalph's defense and rebounding to improve as the<br />\nseason progresses.<br />\nEd Kasoff<br />\nGuard<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'-1\", 180<br />\nKasai', who Coach Doherty expects will he a starting guard this year, seems to have regained his<br />\nshooting tough after some problems last year. Says the<br />\ncoach about Kasai. \"1 hope he can keep up the good<br />\nshooting. I expect he will improve his ball handling<br />\nduring the season, too.\"<br />\nMike Kowatch<br />\nGuard<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'2\", 160<br />\nA sophomore, Kowatch has improved his shooting<br />\nand driving since last year. \"He has great potential<br />\non defense.\" says Doherty: and \"he moves very well<br />\nwithout the hall.\" Mike should see much playing time<br />\nthis season.<br />\nSte\u2018e Mitchell<br />\nForward<br />\nFreshman<br />\n6'5\", 200<br />\nSteve Mitchell attended St. Paul's High School in<br />\nBaltimore. He was recruited by Hopkins for lacrosse<br />\nas well as basketball. \"He has tremendous potential.\"<br />\nsays Doherty. \"Steve's outside shot is great and he's<br />\na good ballhandler for a big man. But his best asset<br />\nis his competitiveness.\" The coach expects him to he<br />\none of the top eight players.<br />\n<br />\nCharles Sikorslo<br />\nGuard<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'4\", 190<br />\nMoving up from the .IV, Sikorsky should give the<br />\n.lays a lot of physical strength under the hoards. \"He<br />\nhas a very good attitude and works hard,\" said the<br />\ncoach.<br />\nMike Snider<br />\nGuard<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'3\", 175<br />\n''One of the most intelligent players I'se e\u2018er coached.\" said Coach Doherty. \"Mike gets everything Om<br />\nof his ability.\" The Ghost is k flown for his great<br />\nshooting ability and according to his coach, Mike's ball<br />\nhandling and defense have improved, making him a<br />\nmore complete player.<br />\nMike Sohr<br />\nGuard<br />\nFreshman<br />\n6'2\", 170<br />\n<br />\nHe has the potential to become a great backcourt<br />\nplayer,\" says Doherty. Sohr, out of Fordham Prep in<br />\nthe Bronx. is a good penetrator and his hall handling<br />\nshould improve as he gets some playing nine.<br />\nGlen Wall<br />\nGuard<br />\nSenior<br />\n5'9\", 170<br />\n<br />\nOne of the co-captains, Glen is expected to he a<br />\nleader. Last year he averaged 10.5 points and 5.6<br />\nassists per game. A line ball handler and shooter, much<br />\nis expected from Wall this year. \"lie must he confident and assertive, a coach on the floor,\" says Doherty.

Dixon's characters are constantly being bombarded by stories or forced to<br />\nact them out, fabrications of<br />\nlife that function as a scrim<br />\nthrough which tlic characters<br />\nmust view reality.

In \"The<br />\nBarbecue\", a group of guests at<br />\na rained-out cookout embellish<br />\ntogether an anecdote one of<br />\nthem has heard; almost all the<br />\nconversation among these people relates in some way to the<br />\nnarration or the truth of the<br />\nanecdote. In \"The Moviemaker,\" a woman calls up her<br />\nformer lover to ask for movie<br />\nrights to his novel, whose subject is their relationship, which<br />\nshe plans to alter to suit her<br />\nown creative needs, reforming<br />\nthe details of the affair into<br />\nsomething more to her liking.<br />\nOther stories deal with extraordinary events occurring in<br />\nordinary lives, so that they take<br />\non the qualities of movies<br />\nthemselves: \"Layaways,\" a<br />\ncautionary talc of urban<br />\nviolence; \"No!

D.C. to<br />\nface an improved Gallaudet College squad. A year ago<br />\nthe Blue Jays opened its season with a 108-76 trouncing of Gallaudet and also heat them 104-65 later in the<br />\nyear.<br />\nThis year's Jays should he a much improved team.<br />\nThough the loss of All-MAC foward Gary Beiminghoff from last year's 7-17 squad should hurt, the<br />\nreturn of Nick Nik'c. who was one of the Jays leading<br />\nscorers two seasons ago should add scoring punch.<br />\nAlso, two freshmen, Steve Mitchell and Mike Sohr,<br />\nboth of whom Coach Ed \"Nap\" Doherty expects w ill<br />\nget much playing time, should be key additions to the<br />\nteam.<br />\n.\"The players all worked hard over the summer,\"<br />\nsaid Coach Doherty, \"and they came back much<br />\nimproved. They all returned in good condition and<br />\nhave worked hard in the pre-season.\"<br />\nIn addition to the regular practices, captains Bob<br />\nClayton and Glen Wall have been leading the team in<br />\nextra drills and running afterwards. \"The attitude of<br />\nthe captains and the seniors in general has been great.\"<br />\nnoted Doherty. \"They've really been leading the<br />\nteam.\"<br />\n\"Our first goal is to make the playoffs,\" said the<br />\ncoach. \"The early part of our schedule, with Maryland<br />\nand Virginia Commonwealth is tough, hut once we get<br />\nby those games we should have an opportunity to do<br />\nvery well. The next few games after those against the<br />\nDivision I opponents are key.\" Last year the Jays lost<br />\nten of its first twelve games and never really recovered.<br />\nThe Jays are a tall team, loaded with good shooters.<br />\nCoach Doherty will he stressing ball handling and<br />\ndefense, as these are the areas where he feels the team<br />\ncan improve.<br />\n',We'd like to be a fast-break team, for with our<br />\nheight it would he to our advantage to run.' noted<br />\nCoach Doherty. \"If we're rebounding well, we can<br />\nrelease a man downcourt.\"<br />\nOn defense the Jays will press at certain times, hut,<br />\nsays the coach. \"We won't be a 94-foot team.\"<br />\nHopkins will also primarily employ a man-to-man<br />\ndefense.<br />\nThe Jays schedule is similar to last year's, with only<br />\nfour new opponents. After the opening- Gallaudet<br />\ngame. Hopkins travels to College Park to take on<br />\nnumber eight in the nation Maryland University. Then<br />\nafter facing another new opponent Gettysburg, who<br />\naccording to Doherly had a good recruiting year, the<br />\nJays will play Virginia Commonwealth University.<br />\nVCU is ranked fifteenth in the nation and, according<br />\nto the Hopkins coach, might be the hest team in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nVirginia.<br />\nAfter facing VCU on Dec. I, the .lays will then face<br />\nMary Washington, Lebanon Valley and Cabrini, all<br />\nthree of which defeated Hopkins last year. The Blue<br />\nJay defense really collapsed in these games, giving up<br />\n86, 89. and 88 points. If the .lays play well, these<br />\nshould all be close contests.<br />\n.January 5 and 6 are the dates for the Blue .lay Tournament, which in addition to Hopkins, includes<br />\nWestern Maryland, who heat the Jays 105-74 last Year,<br />\nPhiladelphia Pharmacy, who twice defeated Hopkins<br />\na year ago, and Case Western. It should he a tough,<br />\nexciting tournament.<br />\nthe .lay's other two non-league games are against<br />\nalways-tough Franklin and Marshall and Messiah<br />\nCollege.<br />\nLast year the Jays tied for third in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast division, with a 5-5 record. This year the<br />\nJays should challenge for one of two playoff spots,<br />\nwhich go to the top finishers in the division.<br />\nOnce again the frontrunner has to be Widener, who<br />\nwas undefeated in the league last year. The rest of the<br />\nleague is also tough, and history has shown that teams<br />\nsuch as Haverford, Swarthmore, and Washington College are especially hard to defeat on their home courts.<br />\nThis year's Jays are much improved. They have<br />\ngreater depth and more quickness in their front line.<br />\nIt should he an exciting season.<br />\nIf I had to go out on a limb and make a prediction,<br />\n1 would say that the team should finish second in the<br />\nleague behind Widener, and I expect that they should<br />\nbe able to break above the .5(X) mark. But if e\u2018erything<br />\ncomes together, the Hopkins hoopsters could go ver<br />\nfar.<br /><br />\nBob Clayton<br />\nCenter<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'6\", 205<br /><br />\nKen Puhalla<br />\nGuard<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'0\", 175<br /><br />\nOne of the two captains on the squad, Clayton will<br />\nstart at center for Hopkins. Last year Clayton averaged<br />\n12.2 points per game and 7.0 rebounds. Unfortunate1 , he also fouled out of seven contests. According to<br />\ncoach Doherty, \"Clayton has returned vastly improved. He can now use both hands inside. Nobody works<br />\nharder. But he must stay out of foul trouble.\" Bob<br />\nhas emerged as a real team leader.<br /><br />\nKen was an integral part of last year's Hopkins<br />\nteam. He is a good shooting guard with a fine<br />\nknowledge of the game. \"Puhalla is a very coachable<br />\nplayer,\" said Doherty, \"and also a very fine technical<br />\ndefensive player.\" Ken averaged 6.8 points per game<br />\nin the MAC league contests.<br /><br />\nRalph Horne<br />\nCenter<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'8\", 202<br /><br />\n\"Ralph has improved 1000/0 on offense,\" notes<br />\nDoherty. \"He's much more apt to shoot.\" Horne,<br />\nwho as a freshman averaged 2.5 points per game and<br />\n2.3 rebounds in limited playing time, should he a big<br />\nforce on this year's team. Coach Doherty looks for<br />\nRalph's defense and rebounding to improve as the<br />\nseason progresses.<br />\nEd Kasoff<br />\nGuard<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'-1\", 180<br />\nKasai', who Coach Doherty expects will he a starting guard this year, seems to have regained his<br />\nshooting tough after some problems last year. Says the<br />\ncoach about Kasai. \"1 hope he can keep up the good<br />\nshooting. I expect he will improve his ball handling<br />\nduring the season, too.\"<br />\nMike Kowatch<br />\nGuard<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'2\", 160<br />\nA sophomore, Kowatch has improved his shooting<br />\nand driving since last year. \"He has great potential<br />\non defense.\" says Doherty: and \"he moves very well<br />\nwithout the hall.\" Mike should see much playing time<br />\nthis season.<br />\nSte\u2018e Mitchell<br />\nForward<br />\nFreshman<br />\n6'5\", 200<br />\nSteve Mitchell attended St. Paul's High School in<br />\nBaltimore. He was recruited by Hopkins for lacrosse<br />\nas well as basketball. \"He has tremendous potential.\"<br />\nsays Doherty. \"Steve's outside shot is great and he's<br />\na good ballhandler for a big man. But his best asset<br />\nis his competitiveness.\" The coach expects him to he<br />\none of the top eight players.<br /><br />\nCharles Sikorslo<br />\nGuard<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'4\", 190<br />\nMoving up from the .IV, Sikorsky should give the<br />\n.lays a lot of physical strength under the hoards. \"He<br />\nhas a very good attitude and works hard,\" said the<br />\ncoach.<br />\nMike Snider<br />\nGuard<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'3\", 175<br />\n''One of the most intelligent players I'se e\u2018er coached.\" said Coach Doherty. \"Mike gets everything Om<br />\nof his ability.\" The Ghost is k flown for his great<br />\nshooting ability and according to his coach, Mike's ball<br />\nhandling and defense have improved, making him a<br />\nmore complete player.<br />\nMike Sohr<br />\nGuard<br />\nFreshman<br />\n6'2\", 170<br /><br />\nHe has the potential to become a great backcourt<br />\nplayer,\" says Doherty.
