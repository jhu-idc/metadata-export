Not long ago we rubbed our inflamed eyeballs<br />\nand asked why do approximately 25% of the undergraduates flunk at least one course each semester? We concluded that possibly the reading period is too short, that<br />\npossibly too many people have too many exams in too<br />\nfew days, and that possibly something can be done<br />\nabout it.<br />\nIn a random sampling involving approximately onetwelfth of the undergraduate body, 40 freshmen, 30<br />\nsophomores, 30 juniors (no seniors, as many of their<br />\nexams are cancelled) ; 51 Arts and Sciences majors, 19<br />\nBusiness majors, 30 engineers) we compiled the following,data: Forty-eight percent of the students will have at<br />\nleast two finals in one day; two-thirds, of these students<br />\nwill have at least one more examination either one day<br />\nprior or later than the date of the two exams. Sixtyseven percent of those polled will take at least one test<br />\nin each of three consecutive days.<br />\nHopkins now has a final examination period of only<br />\nsix days, whereas until a few years ago the examinations<br />\nspanned ten days. We asked Registrar Irene Davis about<br />\nthis. A shorter school- year was wanted, she stated, \"and<br />\nsomeone had to get squeezed.\" We can readily understand why the undergraduate got it in the neck. It seems<br />\nto be in keeping with the Hopkins attitude.<br />\nWe randomly picked out six catalogues of other<br />\ncolleges. These are the facts: Union College, eleven days<br />\nof finals; Middlebury College, ten days; Columbia, ten<br />\ndays; Haverford, twelve days; Dartmouth, nine days;<br />\nHarvard, nineteen days (plus\u2022 a nineteen day reading<br />\nperiod).<br />\nWe leave the above facts for the readers to chew<br />\nfor one week; next, week, more pertinent problems and<br />\nsome solutions from the editors.<br />\n<br />\nIt's About Time ...<br />\nOne of the most pleasant but sorely lacking contributions of the Student Council are the assemblies, held<br />\nFridays at 10:00 a.m. Three years ago, Shriver Hall assemblies were initiated with notable success by the very humorous and<br />\ntalented Al Capp. Unfortunately, nothing on a similar<br />\nplane of enjoyability has been presented since.<br />\nThis year the Student Council has shown little initiative in scheduling assemblies. Dr. Eisenhower's address<br />\nto the students was indeed an excellent contribution to<br />\nthe Hopkins community, but an obvious need to everyone.<br />\nThe two Bell Telephone movies were placed in the lap of<br />\nthe Council; the Council had little to do in procuring them.<br />\nWe suggest that the new Council begin now to work<br />\nup a sched4le of assemblies for next year and if finances<br />\nare the stumbling-block, that efforts be made to obtain<br />\nthe funds either through the SAC or from other sources.<br />\nBy working now, the Council may be able to take<br />\nadvantage of the traveling schedules of talent suitable for<br />\nassemblies. For example, concerts might be arranged if<br />\nGeorge Shearing should come to town again. Friday<br />\nmorning should not conflict with his club engagements and<br />\nsince he is in town, the cost would be low. The same thing<br />\nis true of dance bands, and classical artists. Speakers<br />\nsuch as Al Capp, Walt Kelly, an,d Ogden Nash could be also<br />\nscheduled when in this area.<br />\n<br />\nnoticed a large, red-brick octagonal building standing before my<br />\nline of vision. My curiosity<br />\naroused, I inquired around and<br />\nuncovered<br />\nseveral interesting<br />\ntheories of the use and contents<br />\nof the structure. Some acquaintances of several years' standing<br />\nin this University thought that<br />\nall the female graduate students<br />\nwere locked away in it at night,<br />\nin order to protect them from<br />\na too-easily aroused undergraduate school. So I investigated.<br />\nDr. Walter Koski, of the<br />\nChemistry department, quickly<br />\nenlightened me. The building<br />\ncontains nothing more or less<br />\nthan a fairly large (four million<br />\nelectron volts) Van de Graaf<br />\ngenerator, operated by male<br />\ngraduate students and profe.ssors.<br />\nThe generator stands almost<br />\nforty feet high and the upper<br />\npart is enclosed by a 1000 cubic<br />\nfoot tank which is pressurized<br />\nwith Freon. A hollow steel wall<br />\nfilled with water surrounds the<br />\ntarget room, which is located in<br />\nthe Remsen sub-basement.<br />\nThe principles on which the<br />\nmachine operates are simple, a<br />\ngraduate student informed me:<br />\na Van de Graaf generator is<br />\ncomposed, basically, of a source<br />\nof high positive potential, a<br />\nmoving belt leading to a large<br />\nmetal dome, and a series of<br />\nelectrodes around a high-vacuum<br />\ntube extending from the sphere<br />\nto a target room below.<br />\nMachine's Operation<br />\nElectrons are removed from<br />\nthe belt through the use of an<br />\ninductor plate. The belt removes<br />\nelectrons from the dome, and,<br />\nsince the natural repulsion of<br />\ncharges of like sign forces the<br />\npositive charge to the outside<br />\nof the dome, a large positive potential is built up. At this point,<br />\npositive particles (in this case,<br />\ndeuterons and protons) are introduced into the high-vacuum<br />\ntube.<br />\nThe huge positive charge on<br />\nthe dome, forces the particles<br />\ndown the high-vacuum tube in a<br />\nrapidly-moving stream. A series<br />\nof electrodes, forty-seven in all,<br />\nis placed atound the tube, each<br />\nelectrode down carrying a slightly lower positive charge than<br />\nthe one above it. The .electrodes<br />\ngive the particles added velocity<br />\nand help focus _them into a<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n55<br />\n<br />\nA cut-away view of the Van de Graaf generator behind Remsen<br />\nHall showing its internal structure.<br />\npowerful beam.

This works out to place<br />\nthem in approximately the top<br />\ntwenty-five per cent of their<br />\nsecondary school classes.

The number of applications has held steady for<br />\nthe past two years.<br />\nI wanted to know about the<br />\nagencies and mechanisms of advertising Johns Hopkins to pro-<br />\n<br />\nspective students.

The first is the prestige<br />\nof the University and of its accomplishments. The second is<br />\nthe activities of the Public Relations Office, which is Lynn<br />\nPoole's baliwick.

Not long ago we rubbed our inflamed eyeballs<br />\nand asked why do approximately 25% of the undergraduates flunk at least one course each semester? We concluded that possibly the reading period is too short, that<br />\npossibly too many people have too many exams in too<br />\nfew days, and that possibly something can be done<br />\nabout it.<br />\nIn a random sampling involving approximately onetwelfth of the undergraduate body, 40 freshmen, 30<br />\nsophomores, 30 juniors (no seniors, as many of their<br />\nexams are cancelled) ; 51 Arts and Sciences majors, 19<br />\nBusiness majors, 30 engineers) we compiled the following,data: Forty-eight percent of the students will have at<br />\nleast two finals in one day; two-thirds, of these students<br />\nwill have at least one more examination either one day<br />\nprior or later than the date of the two exams. Sixtyseven percent of those polled will take at least one test<br />\nin each of three consecutive days.<br />\nHopkins now has a final examination period of only<br />\nsix days, whereas until a few years ago the examinations<br />\nspanned ten days. We asked Registrar Irene Davis about<br />\nthis. A shorter school- year was wanted, she stated, \"and<br />\nsomeone had to get squeezed.\" We can readily understand why the undergraduate got it in the neck. It seems<br />\nto be in keeping with the Hopkins attitude.<br />\nWe randomly picked out six catalogues of other<br />\ncolleges. These are the facts: Union College, eleven days<br />\nof finals; Middlebury College, ten days; Columbia, ten<br />\ndays; Haverford, twelve days; Dartmouth, nine days;<br />\nHarvard, nineteen days (plus\u2022 a nineteen day reading<br />\nperiod).<br />\nWe leave the above facts for the readers to chew<br />\nfor one week; next, week, more pertinent problems and<br />\nsome solutions from the editors.<br /><br />\nIt's About Time ...<br />\nOne of the most pleasant but sorely lacking contributions of the Student Council are the assemblies, held<br />\nFridays at 10:00 a.m. Three years ago, Shriver Hall assemblies were initiated with notable success by the very humorous and<br />\ntalented Al Capp. Unfortunately, nothing on a similar<br />\nplane of enjoyability has been presented since.<br />\nThis year the Student Council has shown little initiative in scheduling assemblies. Dr. Eisenhower's address<br />\nto the students was indeed an excellent contribution to<br />\nthe Hopkins community, but an obvious need to everyone.<br />\nThe two Bell Telephone movies were placed in the lap of<br />\nthe Council; the Council had little to do in procuring them.<br />\nWe suggest that the new Council begin now to work<br />\nup a sched4le of assemblies for next year and if finances<br />\nare the stumbling-block, that efforts be made to obtain<br />\nthe funds either through the SAC or from other sources.<br />\nBy working now, the Council may be able to take<br />\nadvantage of the traveling schedules of talent suitable for<br />\nassemblies. For example, concerts might be arranged if<br />\nGeorge Shearing should come to town again. Friday<br />\nmorning should not conflict with his club engagements and<br />\nsince he is in town, the cost would be low. The same thing<br />\nis true of dance bands, and classical artists. Speakers<br />\nsuch as Al Capp, Walt Kelly, an,d Ogden Nash could be also<br />\nscheduled when in this area.<br /><br />\nnoticed a large, red-brick octagonal building standing before my<br />\nline of vision. My curiosity<br />\naroused, I inquired around and<br />\nuncovered<br />\nseveral interesting<br />\ntheories of the use and contents<br />\nof the structure. Some acquaintances of several years' standing<br />\nin this University thought that<br />\nall the female graduate students<br />\nwere locked away in it at night,<br />\nin order to protect them from<br />\na too-easily aroused undergraduate school. So I investigated.<br />\nDr. Walter Koski, of the<br />\nChemistry department, quickly<br />\nenlightened me. The building<br />\ncontains nothing more or less<br />\nthan a fairly large (four million<br />\nelectron volts) Van de Graaf<br />\ngenerator, operated by male<br />\ngraduate students and profe.ssors.<br />\nThe generator stands almost<br />\nforty feet high and the upper<br />\npart is enclosed by a 1000 cubic<br />\nfoot tank which is pressurized<br />\nwith Freon. A hollow steel wall<br />\nfilled with water surrounds the<br />\ntarget room, which is located in<br />\nthe Remsen sub-basement.<br />\nThe principles on which the<br />\nmachine operates are simple, a<br />\ngraduate student informed me:<br />\na Van de Graaf generator is<br />\ncomposed, basically, of a source<br />\nof high positive potential, a<br />\nmoving belt leading to a large<br />\nmetal dome, and a series of<br />\nelectrodes around a high-vacuum<br />\ntube extending from the sphere<br />\nto a target room below.<br />\nMachine's Operation<br />\nElectrons are removed from<br />\nthe belt through the use of an<br />\ninductor plate. The belt removes<br />\nelectrons from the dome, and,<br />\nsince the natural repulsion of<br />\ncharges of like sign forces the<br />\npositive charge to the outside<br />\nof the dome, a large positive potential is built up. At this point,<br />\npositive particles (in this case,<br />\ndeuterons and protons) are introduced into the high-vacuum<br />\ntube.<br />\nThe huge positive charge on<br />\nthe dome, forces the particles<br />\ndown the high-vacuum tube in a<br />\nrapidly-moving stream. A series<br />\nof electrodes, forty-seven in all,<br />\nis placed atound the tube, each<br />\nelectrode down carrying a slightly lower positive charge than<br />\nthe one above it. The .electrodes<br />\ngive the particles added velocity<br />\nand help focus _them into a<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n55<br /><br />\nA cut-away view of the Van de Graaf generator behind Remsen<br />\nHall showing its internal structure.<br />\npowerful beam. The beam is directed at a target of some substance, such as a slug of beryllium. The particles strike the target<br />\nwith<br />\ntremendous force,<br />\nbreaking off fragments of extremely high energy.<br />\nThe deuterons and protons are<br />\nproduced from tanks of hydrogen<br />\nand deuterium. The gases are<br />\nionized into protons and deuterons, the ions are extracted,<br />\nand then emitted into the tube.<br />\n\"It's actually the simplest type<br />\nof accelerator,\" the graduate<br />\nstudent remarked after giving<br />\nhis explanation of its operation.<br />\nDr. 'Koski said that two programs were being carried out<br />\nwith the generator at Johns<br />\nHopkins. One dealt with the<br />\nstudy of the chemical activity<br />\nof the highly energetic fragments\u2014their effects on other<br />\nmolecules and their bonding, for<br />\nexample. The other concerns the<br />\nstudy of the actual transmutations caused by the bombardment of elements with the particles; beryllium, for example,<br /><br />\nwhen struck with<br />\nemits neutrons.<br /><br />\ndeuterons,<br /><br />\nHe stated that nothing ex'<br />\n.tremely striking had been discovered, although several students of the department had<br />\nreceived their degrees though<br />\nwork on the generator.<br />\nWas there any danger of radiation involved? The graduaW<br />\nstudent didn't seem to think so.<br />\n\"Most of the radiation is lowenergy stuff; the water in these<br />\nwalls stops almost all of it.\u00b0<br />\nDr. Koski remarked that the<br />\nradiation consisted of neutronS<br />\nand gamma rays, and that<br />\neveryone wore radiation badges<br />\nwhile working around the Ma\"<br />\nchine. The student pointed W<br />\na chart on the wall: there were<br />\nthe numbers of seven badgeS<br />\nlisted. There were less than<br />\ntwenty Milliroentgens listed MI\"<br />\nder \"gamma rays\", and \"under<br />\n19\" listed for \"fast neutron\"<br />\n\"It is possible to get more radia'<br />\ntion watching television than We<br />\nthe<br />\nusually<br />\nget,\" concluded<br />\nstudent.<br /><br />\n'Ti!

This works out to place<br />\nthem in approximately the top<br />\ntwenty-five per cent of their<br />\nsecondary school classes.

A letter<br />\nof recommendation from one of<br />\nthe individual's secondary school<br />\nteachers is also carefully considered.

The number of applications has held steady for<br />\nthe past two years.<br />\nI wanted to know about the<br />\nagencies and mechanisms of advertising Johns Hopkins to pro-<br /><br />\nspective students. Mr. Logan replied that there were four main<br />\nsources of publicity for Johns<br />\nHopkins, outside the Admissions<br />\nOffice. The first is the prestige<br />\nof the University and of its accomplishments. The second is<br />\nthe activities of the Public Relations Office, which is Lynn<br />\nPoole's baliwick. The third is<br />\nthe Alumni Relations Office and<br />\nits organ, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMagazine. The fourth, the student participation and enthusiasm in attracting prosepctive<br />\nstudents, which he considers a<br />\nUniversity's greatest asset.<br />\nDefines Jobs<br />\nHe defined the jobs of the<br />\nOffice with regard to advertisement to be the prompt and<br />\ncourteous supplying of information to interested individuals,<br />\nand the publication and distribution of adequate and attractive catalogues, brochures, and<br />\nthe like. A third task consists of<br />\nhaving the staff members visit<br />\nmany secondary schools each<br />\nyear, the staff members being<br />\nhelped by the various Alumni<br />\nCommittees around the country.<br />\nThe phone rang, and while he<br />\nwas talking to a State Senator,<br />\nI left, still wondering whether<br />\nLogan could be the man responsible for the varsity lacrosse<br />\nteam this year.<br /><br />\nHopkins Store<br />\n3101 ST.
