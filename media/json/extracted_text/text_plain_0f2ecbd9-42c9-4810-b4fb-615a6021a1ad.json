Although the metropolitan papers have ignored<br />\nMx Stassen's speech, we feel that any such discussion<br />\nof the pertinent problems of the peace deserves comment.<br />\nMr Stassen's principal idea is that the United Nations<br />\nshould form the nucleus of an international government to control the entire post-war world. The Units.d<br />\nNations would exert temporary control over the Axis<br />\nnations without 'inhuman vengeance against the populations.' This concept is in line with an opinion which<br />\nmany people have held that the world will and should<br />\nbe controlled by an international government rather<br />\nthan by many disunited ones.<br />\nTo establish such a government would require the<br />\novercoming of more than administrative difficulties. It<br />\nwould require the breaking--down of deeply founded<br />\ndistinctions of race, environment, language, and local<br />\ntradition. Mr Stassen's proposal that production,<br />\neconomy, government, education, all be put on a worldwide basis will go much farther toward developing international unity than did the League of Nations; but<br />\nhe must further recognize that cultural unity must be<br />\nachieved. This task may be impossible; it will certainly take careful, intelligent planning and many years.<br />\nAnother principal weakness in Mr Stassen's proposal is his point that the Axis nations should be disarmed, while the United Nations remain armed. Although such action may be inevitable in the process of<br />\ndeveloping international organization, such moves<br />\ntoward inequality should be avoided; and if inequalities<br />\nmust arise, they should be rectified as soon as possible.<br />\nAlthough the peace is probably far in the future,<br />\nit is not too early to begin thinking about it. Goveinor<br />\nStassen's points are promising of an intelligent outlook<br />\nfor peacetime administration.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nVags Give 'The Three Sisters'<br />\nFair Version Masterfully Handled<br />\nOf 'Candid'<br />\nBy JAMES APPLEGATE<br />\nAs a whole the Vagabond theater's<br />\nproduction of Candida, by George<br />\nBernard Shaw, is only mediocre; but<br />\nthe performance is well worth seeing<br />\nnot only because of the good points<br />\nthat the Vagabond interpretation<br />\ndoes have, but also because of the<br />\nexcellencies of Mr Shaw's drama.<br />\nRoger Maxwell, as James Morrell,<br />\nthe idealistic and socialistic Anglican<br />\npastor, gives a finished and understanding portrayal.<br />\nMabel Scott<br />\nGeorgi, as his wife Candida, is a<br />\npoor partner for him; while she<br />\nspeaks and moves with adequate expression, she shows practically no<br />\nemotion. She fails to convince the<br />\naudience that Candida's charms are<br />\nsufficient cause for the action that<br />\ncenters around her.<br />\nMoore, as Marchbanks, the tragically poetic eighteen year old, rises<br />\nto no variations of emotion. His<br />\nmedium of character portrayal is a<br />\nconstant pained expression and a<br />\nstiff walk; his speech alternates only<br />\nbetween<br />\ndreaminess and frenzy.<br />\nMary Alvey, as Miss Prossy, is a<br />\ndisappointment, considering her usual<br />\nexcellence; she is comic, but at times<br />\nshe fails to convey Shaw's nuance by<br />\ncontinuing at too rapid a pace.<br />\nMartin Murray, as the scurrulotis<br />\nMr Burgess, and Arthur Hazard, as<br />\nthe apprentice pastor, are quite good<br />\nin their small parts.<br />\nMuch of the deficiency in the acting, as well as in the staging, can<br />\nprobably be attributed to poor direction by Greg Mooney. Miss Alvey's<br />\nrapid delivery, in particular, may<br />\nwell be the fault of the director.<br />\nMr Dobson's staging is generally adequate, but it seldom adds to<br />\nthe action of the play and at times<br />\nit is clumsy. His use of characters<br />\ntalking into the wall is more annoying than dramatic, and he often fails<br />\nto make evident the motivation for a<br />\ncharacter's action.

Although the metropolitan papers have ignored<br />\nMx Stassen's speech, we feel that any such discussion<br />\nof the pertinent problems of the peace deserves comment.<br />\nMr Stassen's principal idea is that the United Nations<br />\nshould form the nucleus of an international government to control the entire post-war world. The Units.d<br />\nNations would exert temporary control over the Axis<br />\nnations without 'inhuman vengeance against the populations.' This concept is in line with an opinion which<br />\nmany people have held that the world will and should<br />\nbe controlled by an international government rather<br />\nthan by many disunited ones.<br />\nTo establish such a government would require the<br />\novercoming of more than administrative difficulties. It<br />\nwould require the breaking--down of deeply founded<br />\ndistinctions of race, environment, language, and local<br />\ntradition. Mr Stassen's proposal that production,<br />\neconomy, government, education, all be put on a worldwide basis will go much farther toward developing international unity than did the League of Nations; but<br />\nhe must further recognize that cultural unity must be<br />\nachieved. This task may be impossible; it will certainly take careful, intelligent planning and many years.<br />\nAnother principal weakness in Mr Stassen's proposal is his point that the Axis nations should be disarmed, while the United Nations remain armed. Although such action may be inevitable in the process of<br />\ndeveloping international organization, such moves<br />\ntoward inequality should be avoided; and if inequalities<br />\nmust arise, they should be rectified as soon as possible.<br />\nAlthough the peace is probably far in the future,<br />\nit is not too early to begin thinking about it. Goveinor<br />\nStassen's points are promising of an intelligent outlook<br />\nfor peacetime administration.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br /><br />\nVags Give 'The Three Sisters'<br />\nFair Version Masterfully Handled<br />\nOf 'Candid'<br />\nBy JAMES APPLEGATE<br />\nAs a whole the Vagabond theater's<br />\nproduction of Candida, by George<br />\nBernard Shaw, is only mediocre; but<br />\nthe performance is well worth seeing<br />\nnot only because of the good points<br />\nthat the Vagabond interpretation<br />\ndoes have, but also because of the<br />\nexcellencies of Mr Shaw's drama.<br />\nRoger Maxwell, as James Morrell,<br />\nthe idealistic and socialistic Anglican<br />\npastor, gives a finished and understanding portrayal.<br />\nMabel Scott<br />\nGeorgi, as his wife Candida, is a<br />\npoor partner for him; while she<br />\nspeaks and moves with adequate expression, she shows practically no<br />\nemotion. She fails to convince the<br />\naudience that Candida's charms are<br />\nsufficient cause for the action that<br />\ncenters around her.<br />\nMoore, as Marchbanks, the tragically poetic eighteen year old, rises<br />\nto no variations of emotion. His<br />\nmedium of character portrayal is a<br />\nconstant pained expression and a<br />\nstiff walk; his speech alternates only<br />\nbetween<br />\ndreaminess and frenzy.<br />\nMary Alvey, as Miss Prossy, is a<br />\ndisappointment, considering her usual<br />\nexcellence; she is comic, but at times<br />\nshe fails to convey Shaw's nuance by<br />\ncontinuing at too rapid a pace.<br />\nMartin Murray, as the scurrulotis<br />\nMr Burgess, and Arthur Hazard, as<br />\nthe apprentice pastor, are quite good<br />\nin their small parts.<br />\nMuch of the deficiency in the acting, as well as in the staging, can<br />\nprobably be attributed to poor direction by Greg Mooney. Miss Alvey's<br />\nrapid delivery, in particular, may<br />\nwell be the fault of the director.<br />\nMr Dobson's staging is generally adequate, but it seldom adds to<br />\nthe action of the play and at times<br />\nit is clumsy. His use of characters<br />\ntalking into the wall is more annoying than dramatic, and he often fails<br />\nto make evident the motivation for a<br />\ncharacter's action.
