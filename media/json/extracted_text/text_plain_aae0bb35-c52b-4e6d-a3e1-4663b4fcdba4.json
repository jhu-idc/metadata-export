Popularity to be lasting must<br />\nbe deserved.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIALS<br />\nNIGHT FOOTBALL AND THE FUTURE<br />\n<br />\nONE<br />\n<br />\nfootball has been introduced to Hopkins students. The<br />\nNIGHT<br />\ninitial performance at Homewood was not a roaring success. The<br />\ngate was rather poor. The old thrill was absent. What should have<br />\nbeen an occasion for much rejoicing turned out to be a rather dull affair.<br />\nThere were numerous complaints. Some objected to the cold, others to<br />\nthe lights, which they claimed hurt their eyes. We may be taught to<br />\nlike night football but the process of learning is rather unpleasant.<br />\nAs to the game itself, it was an unqualified success. Brighter days<br />\nahead in the athletic world may be seen for Hopkins. Sports writers<br />\nof the Baltimore daily papers pointed out that we would have to wait<br />\nanother week before judging the strength of the Hopkins team. However, we know Upsala to be of _approximately the same calibre as the<br />\nJuniata team which defeated Hopkins in the opening home game last<br />\nseason. We do not predict anything so rash as an undefeated season,<br />\nbut the Hopkins team has a score punch. Future games will be worth<br />\nwatching. The team appeared to be well coached and in excellent<br />\ncondition. There was not a single senior in the starting line-up. Most<br />\nof the reserves were freshmen. We hope that Hopkins is entering a<br />\nnew athletic era.<br />\n<br />\nwillalways<br />\nstand out<br />\nHOME RUNS are made at the<br />\nplate \u2014 not on the bench!<br />\nLikewise what counts in a cigarette is what a smoker gets from<br />\nit \u2014 not what is said about it.<br />\nChesterfield has a policy\u2014give<br />\nsmokers what they want:<br />\n<br />\nWe firmly advocate the playing of the Lehigh and Haverford games<br />\nin the afternoon. Both of these games should draw a large crowd to<br />\nHomewood. Judging from the attendance at the opening game, it<br />\nis doubtful that the playing of either game at night will draw any<br />\nlarger crowd that would the same game in the afternoon. On the<br />\nother hand, it is certain that football in the sunlight has a much;<br />\ngreater appeal for Hopkins students. We regret that Hopkins is forced<br />\nto play St. John's at night due to the shifting of the Navy-Southern<br />\nMethodist game from Annapolis to the Stadium.<br />\n<br />\nMILDNESS\u2014 the wholly natural mildness of tobaccos that are<br />\nwithout harshness or bitterness.<br />\nBETTER TASTE\u2014such as only<br />\na cigarette of -wholesome purity<br />\nand better tobaccos can have.<br />\n<br />\nTHE STUDENT COUNCIL<br />\nTT seems to us quiet regretable that the administration was forced to<br />\neject the principal organ of student government at Hopkins from its<br />\noffice. It is no doubt true that the Student Council does not need a<br />\nroom all the time throughout the year. On certain occasions, nevertheless, it is imperative that this body have a room to carry on their<br />\nwork, and furthermore they cannot share this room with anyone else.<br />\nThere work has to be done in private. Let us hope that the administration is able to find another location for the governing body of the<br />\nstudent government of which the University is proud.<br />\n<br />\nTO THE FRESHMEN<br />\nRESHMAN regulations have been completely abolished at Hopkins.<br />\nFSome<br />\ntraditions remain however. One of these is not observed as<br />\nwell as it might be. We refer to the custom of speaking to every<br />\nHopkins man met on the campus. This seems at first sight to be a<br />\nrather trivial thing. \"Hello,\" however, creates a friendly spirit much<br />\nto be desired. Some of the present freshman class seem to realize it,<br />\nothers either do not care or have attempted it, and not receiving any<br />\nreply have ceased the practice. We merely ask the freshman to remember that he is expected to speak first, and to notice that he will<br />\nbe answered except in rare cases.<br />\n<br />\nChesterfield Cigarettes are manufactured by<br />\nLIGGETT & MYERS TOBACCO CO.<br />\n<br />\n\f3<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 7, 1930<br />\nRY<br />\nnd enlso<br />\nle fin.<br />\n)0 enoneyeach<br />\nDept.<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nre<br />\n<br />\nDORM DOINGS<br />\nThe men are all back in the dorm,<br />\naugmented by many quaint and<br />\natrocious specimens of Freshmen.<br />\nMost of the rooms are occupied.<br />\nHowever, there are several vacancies\u2014the food is as good a<br />\nreason as yours.<br />\nFor a short time gloom hovered<br />\nover the denizens of the dorm.

Popularity to be lasting must<br />\nbe deserved.<br /><br />\nEDITORIALS<br />\nNIGHT FOOTBALL AND THE FUTURE<br /><br />\nONE<br /><br />\nfootball has been introduced to Hopkins students. The<br />\nNIGHT<br />\ninitial performance at Homewood was not a roaring success. The<br />\ngate was rather poor. The old thrill was absent. What should have<br />\nbeen an occasion for much rejoicing turned out to be a rather dull affair.<br />\nThere were numerous complaints. Some objected to the cold, others to<br />\nthe lights, which they claimed hurt their eyes. We may be taught to<br />\nlike night football but the process of learning is rather unpleasant.<br />\nAs to the game itself, it was an unqualified success. Brighter days<br />\nahead in the athletic world may be seen for Hopkins. Sports writers<br />\nof the Baltimore daily papers pointed out that we would have to wait<br />\nanother week before judging the strength of the Hopkins team. However, we know Upsala to be of _approximately the same calibre as the<br />\nJuniata team which defeated Hopkins in the opening home game last<br />\nseason. We do not predict anything so rash as an undefeated season,<br />\nbut the Hopkins team has a score punch. Future games will be worth<br />\nwatching. The team appeared to be well coached and in excellent<br />\ncondition. There was not a single senior in the starting line-up. Most<br />\nof the reserves were freshmen. We hope that Hopkins is entering a<br />\nnew athletic era.<br /><br />\nwillalways<br />\nstand out<br />\nHOME RUNS are made at the<br />\nplate \u2014 not on the bench!<br />\nLikewise what counts in a cigarette is what a smoker gets from<br />\nit \u2014 not what is said about it.<br />\nChesterfield has a policy\u2014give<br />\nsmokers what they want:<br /><br />\nWe firmly advocate the playing of the Lehigh and Haverford games<br />\nin the afternoon. Both of these games should draw a large crowd to<br />\nHomewood. Judging from the attendance at the opening game, it<br />\nis doubtful that the playing of either game at night will draw any<br />\nlarger crowd that would the same game in the afternoon. On the<br />\nother hand, it is certain that football in the sunlight has a much;<br />\ngreater appeal for Hopkins students. We regret that Hopkins is forced<br />\nto play St. John's at night due to the shifting of the Navy-Southern<br />\nMethodist game from Annapolis to the Stadium.<br /><br />\nMILDNESS\u2014 the wholly natural mildness of tobaccos that are<br />\nwithout harshness or bitterness.<br />\nBETTER TASTE\u2014such as only<br />\na cigarette of -wholesome purity<br />\nand better tobaccos can have.<br /><br />\nTHE STUDENT COUNCIL<br />\nTT seems to us quiet regretable that the administration was forced to<br />\neject the principal organ of student government at Hopkins from its<br />\noffice. It is no doubt true that the Student Council does not need a<br />\nroom all the time throughout the year. On certain occasions, nevertheless, it is imperative that this body have a room to carry on their<br />\nwork, and furthermore they cannot share this room with anyone else.<br />\nThere work has to be done in private. Let us hope that the administration is able to find another location for the governing body of the<br />\nstudent government of which the University is proud.<br /><br />\nTO THE FRESHMEN<br />\nRESHMAN regulations have been completely abolished at Hopkins.<br />\nFSome<br />\ntraditions remain however. One of these is not observed as<br />\nwell as it might be. We refer to the custom of speaking to every<br />\nHopkins man met on the campus. This seems at first sight to be a<br />\nrather trivial thing. \"Hello,\" however, creates a friendly spirit much<br />\nto be desired. Some of the present freshman class seem to realize it,<br />\nothers either do not care or have attempted it, and not receiving any<br />\nreply have ceased the practice. We merely ask the freshman to remember that he is expected to speak first, and to notice that he will<br />\nbe answered except in rare cases.<br /><br />\nChesterfield Cigarettes are manufactured by<br />\nLIGGETT &amp; MYERS TOBACCO CO.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 7, 1930<br />\nRY<br />\nnd enlso<br />\nle fin.<br />\n)0 enoneyeach<br />\nDept.<br />\nand<br /><br />\nre<br /><br />\nDORM DOINGS<br />\nThe men are all back in the dorm,<br />\naugmented by many quaint and<br />\natrocious specimens of Freshmen.<br />\nMost of the rooms are occupied.<br />\nHowever, there are several vacancies\u2014the food is as good a<br />\nreason as yours.<br />\nFor a short time gloom hovered<br />\nover the denizens of the dorm.
