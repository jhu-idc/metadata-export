At<br />\nWednesday's meeting, this amendment was discussed at somelength<br />\nboth by Graduate Athletic Manager<br />\nHarry Burgan and by C. E. Ellicott, the sponsor of the proposed<br />\namendment. The former argued<br />\nthat the harmony at present existing between the Board and the<br />\nvarious managers would certainly<br />\nbe disturbed upon the managers<br />\nthemselves becoming members of<br />\nthe Board. The latter contended,<br />\non the other hand, that practical<br />\nco-operation between the Board and<br />\na manager, was, under the present<br />\nconditions, certainly impossible;<br />\nand that the only thing to remedy<br />\nthis was the presence of the undergraduate manager on the Board<br />\nas a member.

The latter contended,<br />\non the other hand, that practical<br />\nco-operation between the Board and<br />\na manager, was, under the present<br />\nconditions, certainly impossible;<br />\nand that the only thing to remedy<br />\nthis was the presence of the undergraduate manager on the Board<br />\nas a member.
