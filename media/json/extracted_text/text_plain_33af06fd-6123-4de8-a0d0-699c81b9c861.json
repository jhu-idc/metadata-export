More than 1000 students<br />\ntake at least one course per<br />\nsemester using this grading<br />\nsystem.<br />\nOriginally instituted to permit students to take courses<br />\noutside of their major without<br />\nhaving to worry about a<br />\ngrade, the option has come to<br />\nbe interpreted differently by<br />\nstudents. According to Assistant Dean for Academic<br />\nStudies Martha Roseman,<br />\n\"students now feel that 'if I<br />\ndon't do well, I'll ,take it<br />\npass/fail; if I do well, I'll take<br />\nit for a grade.' \" Although<br />\nrepresenting a change in<br />\nphilosophy, Roseman does<br />\nnot feel that the alternative<br />\ngrading system has been<br />\nabused.<br />\nThe worst problem occurs<br />\nwhen students attempt to<br />\nchange their pass/fail decisions beyond the last date to<br />\n<br />\ndo so or even after the<br />\nsemester's grades have been<br />\nrecorded. \"Students that<br />\ndon't do well come to me and<br />\nbeg or even have a faculty<br />\nmember recommend that<br />\ngrades be changed to<br />\npass/fail,\" said Roseman.

It<br />\nallows students to \"get their<br />\nmoney's worth out of their<br />\neducation.

The importance of<br />\nthe dean of Arts and Sciences to the<br />\nacademic life of most Hopkins students<br />\nnecessitates that undergraduate concerns are<br />\nconsidered in the deliberations to pick the<br />\nnew dean.

(I ended my beer-drinking phase<br />\nupon reaching 21 years.) And<br />\nsince coffee is drunk for the<br />\nbetter part of the day (and<br />\nnight), it is this beverage to<br />\nwhich I'll devote myself here.<br />\nAlthough I've long been a<br />\ncoffee-drinker (weaned on<br />\ncoffee-milk during kindergarten days by my patient and persistent father, to whom this<br />\npiece is dedicated), my consumption habits became fixed<br />\nduring my early days at college,<br />\nlike so many others. During the<br />\nfirst semester of freshman year<br />\nthere are two basic types of coffee drinkers. The first group includes those who rarely drank<br />\nit before, but begin to preceding<br />\nthe first major exams. These<br />\nconsumers often cannot discern<br />\nlevels of quality; to them it all<br />\ntastes like brackish swamp<br />\nwater. Thus, massive amounts<br />\nof cream and sugar are added<br />\nto render the coffee palatable.<br />\n(Wouldn't it be easier to pop a<br />\nfew No-Doz or some speed?)<br />\nMembers of the second group<br />\nare already confirmed guzzlers<br />\nwho are sent on a quest for the<br />\nbest, cheapest, or most available coffee on campus. At<br />\nHopkins there are only a few<br />\n\"coffee-ing holes,\" mostly dictated by location and time of<br />\nday.<br />\nThe daytime Gilman Coffee<br />\nShop probably leads in quantity; have you ever noticed, the<br />\nfilters lined up already filled<br />\nwith ground coffee waiting to<br />\nbe brewed during mid-morning<br />\ncoffee rush? A truly awesome<br />\nsight. The coffee here is adequate. Also, the adulterator is<br />\nderived from an animal that actually once said, \"Moo,\" so<br />\n<br />\nthis passes. (Have you ever<br />\nwondered about what \"nondairy\" creamer actually is?) But<br />\nbest of all about the GCS is the<br />\nservers. Yes, the wait in line is<br />\noccasionally agonizing, but<br />\nmost coffee shuttlers here recognize those in need of their<br />\nmorning fix.

I used<br />\nto despise machine coffee until<br />\na compatriot in coffeeology<br />\nclued me in to his secret. He<br />\nclaims that drinking machine<br />\ncoffee all depends on your at-<br />\n<br />\ntitude and expectations. If you<br />\nexpect it to be good to the last<br />\ndrop, you'll be rudely disappointed. Instead, don't even<br />\nconsider the beverage dispensed from the many-buttoned<br />\nmachine as coffee. Just call it<br />\n\"coffee-drink,\" in the same<br />\nway that orange drink is<br />\nanalogous to orange juice. Of<br />\ncourse coffee-drink must contain minimum of 10 percent genuine coffee. A refreshment<br />\ncontaining less than 10 percent<br />\nconstitutes \"coffee-ade.\" Finally, \"bionic coffee\u2014 is 100 percent synthesized by man, and<br />\nnothing in it has ever lived, including sugar and milk.<br />\nThere's little to say about<br />\nLevering cafeteria coffee except<br />\nthat it's there and passes the<br />\nsipping test.

Referring to<br />\nProfessor David's lecture on<br />\nthe freeze, he says that two<br />\nmain points of this lecture were<br />\n\"illogical.\" The first of these<br />\npoints is Professor David's<br />\nstipulation that the freeze, by<br />\nfreezing nuclear offensive<br />\ncapabilities but not defensive<br />\nmeasures, would undermine<br />\nour deterrence. Professor<br />\nSpring sees this as \"illogical\"<br />\nbecause \"surely [the freezel<br />\nwould strengthen deterrence on<br />\ntwo grounds.\" From this statement, it is quite evident that<br />\nProfessor Spring is totally ignorant as to what deterrence is<br />\nreally all about. Deterrence,<br />\nwhich has been the United<br />\nStates policy with regard to<br />\nnuclear weapons for many<br />\nyears now, is based upon survivable second-sirike nuclear<br />\nforces. In order for both superpowers to feel secure in the age<br />\nof nuclear weapons, each side<br />\nmust feel that it would still have<br />\nthe capability to cause unacceptable damage to its adversary<br />\neven after it has been hit with<br />\na first strike. This is known as<br />\n\"mutually-assumed destruction,\" and while it is a rather<br />\nhorrible-sounding name, it has<br />\nproven to be effective in deterring the use of nuclear weapons<br />\n(so far!). In order to do this,<br />\neach side must maintain nuclear<br />\nwarheads which they know will<br />\nnot all be destroyed in the event<br />\nhat the other side should<br />\n<br />\ndecide to strike first. As long as<br />\nthese \"survivable second-strike<br />\nforces\" are maintained, both<br />\nsides will realize that if they<br />\nwere to strike first, they would<br />\ncertainly bring unacceptable<br />\ndamage upon themselves. Hence,<br />\nneither side will strike, and<br />\ndeterrence has succeeded.<br />\nHow does the freeze undermine this deterrence? By allowing each side to develop defensive weapons, such as antiballistic missiles, lasers capable<br />\nof destroying warheads in<br />\nflight, etc., the freeze could<br />\npossibly enable one (or both)<br />\nnations to achieve total invulnerability from the adversary's missiles. Once this has<br />\noccured, deterrence will be obsolete, because there will be no<br />\nthreat to prevent a first strike.<br />\nThe nation that struck first<br />\ncould annihilate its opponent<br />\nand defend itself with the defensive weapons that it had<br />\ndeveloped. There would be nothing to deter them.<br />\nEvidently Professor Spring i<br />\nignorant of these rather important facts. This brings us to his<br />\nnext point. He says of Professor David's lecture: \"The<br />\nimplication is that only experts<br />\nhave the right to speak on<br />\nnuclear defense.\" Of course, in<br />\na democracy with guaranteed<br />\nfreedom of speech such as ours,<br />\n_everyone has the right to speak<br />\non any subject s/he wishes.

The<br />\n3-credit Evening College course,<br />\n\"Feasibility and Implementation of Robotic Systems,\" was<br />\ntaught by Barry Whitman and<br />\nWendell Leimbach.<br />\nSince the course was designed for masters in administrative<br />\nscience degree students, it did<br />\nnot go too deeply into the<br />\ntechnical aspects of robots. Instead, it focused on the use of<br />\nrobots in industry. Whitman<br />\nsaid that robots are used for the<br />\n\"three D's: Dirty work, Dull<br />\nwork and Dangerous work.\"<br />\nWhitman also said \"the class is<br />\na mind-stretching thing.\". People must. know what will happen if companies use robotic<br />\nsystems to replace the workforce, Whitman explained.<br />\nOne management problem<br />\nthat Whitman cited was that, in<br />\nthe future, factories may not<br />\nneed as many parking spaces,<br />\nas there will be fewer workers.<br />\nHe pointed out, however, that<br />\nfactories will always need<br />\nworkers to keep the robots<br />\nrunning.<br />\nOne of the robots used in<br />\nSaturday's demonstration was<br />\nreally just a working arm. The<br />\nmini-robot, which is made by<br />\nUnimation and sells for $8(100,<br />\nis run by an Apple computer. It<br />\nis a model of the type of robot<br />\ntypically found in the workplace.The other robot was a<br />\n\"R2-D2 look-alike,\" according<br />\nto Whitman. The robot, borrowed from Equitable Bank actually is just used for promotional purposes. Unlike many<br />\nrobots used in industry, it is not<br />\nautomated but is directed by<br />\nradio control. Whitman said he<br />\nused the robot to dispel the<br />\npopular conception of what<br />\nrobot is like.<br />\nThe social implications oi<br />\nrobots was another part of th(<br />\ncourse. Whitman said that thi \u2022<br />\n<br />\ntopic provoked the most discussion in the classroom. The<br />\npopular theory, according to<br />\nWhitman, was that as robots<br />\ncome, people go. Robots in industry have already displaced<br />\nsome jobs. Yet, according to<br />\nWhitman, the federal government has no plans at all to deal<br />\nwith employees replaced by<br />\nrobots.<br />\nWhitman proposes retraining<br />\nfor those unemployed by robots. He admitted, though, that<br />\nnot all of those unemployed can<br />\nbe retrained. Whitman said,<br />\n\"I believe that the work Force<br />\nis so terrified that the topic cannot he dketissed.\" He explained that the problem goes to the<br />\nvery heart of their existence.<br />\nThe factory has been a part of<br />\ntheir families, and taking the<br />\nwork away is disruptive.

Kun explained, \"It's great<br />\nthat you can have more people<br />\nliving on campus, and it's great<br />\nthat you can try to build a<br />\ngreater sense of community,<br />\nbut this situation, when coupled<br />\nwith other things, such as increased tuition, is a very expensiye proposition.\"<br />\nStudents who choose not to<br />\nlive in University-owned apartments/dorms can research options and housing facilities<br />\navailable to them.

Albee visits Homewood<br />\ncampus April 11, when he will give a public lecture<br />\n(and possibly a reading) in Shrivel. Hall, as part of.<br />\nthe Writing Seminars-.sponsored Arts lair, which<br />\nformally kicks olf tomorrow with the presentation<br />\nOf the Kenai, Awards.<br />\nOver Spring Break a couple of us went, not to<br />\nHorida, but to a less temperate New York, and even<br />\nthough we didn't see swarms of people .sauntering<br />\naround without clothing, tve managed to make Our<br />\ntime worthwhile. Edward Alhee's new play, The<br />\nMan Who Had I hree Arms, which he also directs.,<br />\nrec\u2022ently opened on Broadway; the previews were<br />\ndemanding u great deal of his time, but nevertheless.<br />\nhe agreed to let us interview him at his apartment.<br />\nThe street on which he lives in the lower West<br />\nSide of Manhattan used to be the center of the<br />\n\"cheese district\": we are confronted by warehouses<br />\nand seem still to catch the whiff of cheese in the<br />\nair. The warehouses are dingy gray brick, unimposing. We step onto a wooden loading platform in<br />\nfront of one. There is Albee's name above the<br />\nbuzzer. We rise in an old freight elevator and enter<br />\nthe playwright's loll apartment. The ugly facade of<br />\nthe building envelopes something cavernous and<br />\nsplendid: one wall deep red brick, polished hard-<br />\n<br />\nwood floors, furnishings sparse but elegant. A<br />\nplump Siamese cat pads over to me and rubs her<br />\nneck against my leg.<br />\nAlbee leads us up an iron spiral staircase<br />\n(aquamarine) to the second level, which, when seen<br />\nfrom below, protrudes only partly into the expansiveness of the main room. A huge skylight cuts the<br />\nfar end of the ceiling; we look at it more closely<br />\nfrom the upper level, and Albee mentions that it<br />\nused to be an elevator shaft. We pass through his<br />\nbedroom and enter a small, but high-ceilinged,<br />\nstudy.<br />\nAlbee is wearing cotton slacks and a black shortsleeved polo shirt. He seems to be in fine physical<br />\n\u2022hape: excepting a little paunch, he is well-muscled,<br />\ncan. He has long, straight, streaked-gray hair; a<br />\npair of glasses are angled up on his head as if that<br />\nis their natural perch (though he takes them off to<br />\ntwist absent-mindedly between his fingers every so<br />\noften, while we're talking, he never puts them over<br />\nhis eyes: back they go, up on his head). A bushy<br />\ngray mustache hangs over his mouth. He smiles<br />\ninfrequently\u2014he seems reserved and serious, his<br />\noice low and sonorous\u2014hut when he does, it is<br />\nbroad and friendly , and when I see it in profile, I<br />\nget the curious impression of the grin of a cat. His<br />\ntalk is measured and thoughtful and, like an actor,<br />\nhis voice comes deep from the diaphragm.<br />\nN-L: When I was in high school, Mr. Albee,<br />\nplayed the role of .Jerry in The Zoo .Story; shortly<br />\nthereafter, I noticed an ad in the Times for \"Albee<br />\ndirects Albee\" at Columbia University. So I had<br />\nthe opportunity to sec The Zoo Story and The<br />\nAmerican Dream, as directed by you. Now that I'm<br />\nhere, I can ask you about something specific in the<br />\nproduction which struck me at the time\u2014it concerns<br />\n<br />\nthe very opening of that production of The Zoo<br />\nStory. You had .Jerry in a tight T-shirt, drinking a<br />\ncan of Coke, a swagger to his walk, and then<br />\nfinishing the can of Coke and tossing it behind his<br />\nhack into a garbage pail before opening his dialogue<br />\nwith Peter. 'That was something completely different from what I had envisioned, and it kind of<br />\nbothered me at first. I had a totally different conception of ,Jerry from what you seemed to convey<br />\nin that opening.<br />\n,4LBEE: What was your conception?<br />\nN-L: I didn't see .Jerry as the cocky, macho type<br />\nof person that was implicit in that sort of arrangement. But that, of course, is entirely subjective...What I've been thinking about is the distinction between the realm of the playwright and that<br />\nof the director, how the two'crafts coincide and<br />\nwhere they div ergc, and how one relates, as a<br />\nplaywright, to the director and vice versa. In regard<br />\nto that particular production, you were both<br />\nplay wright and director.<br />\nALBEE: Let's see now. That very opening was<br />\njust a bit of business that th, actor wanted to do,<br />\n.ind I didn't see any reason why he shouldn't go<br />\n..vith his instinct; he seemed quite capable of walk<br />\ning, thinking and drinking a Coke at the same time.<br />\nIt was meant to indicate no particular attitude about<br />\nanything; if he'd tossed it on the ground rather than<br />\nin the trash can, I suppose that might have indicated<br />\nsomething. The fact that he tossed it in the trash<br />\ncan indicates a kind of neatness-, I suppose. But the<br />\nbasic thing I was after in the Production was... I've<br />\nseen other people direct it, and too often Jerry is<br />\ndirected and acted as being a psychopath, as being<br />\nalready a suicide, already at the end. What I've<br />\nalways seen him as is too sane, a teacher. somebod<br />\n<br />\nPalmists Read Palms Among Red Velvet<br />\nBY DAVID HUDACEK<br />\nI had serious doubts as I neared the salon of the<br />\npalm reader on ('harks Street. On my occasional<br />\nj:111111s 10 the Charles I heater, I had seen the palm<br />\nIcader sitting by the window of her shop, pointing<br />\nto me amid Ihen curling her finger Iowa'ds herself,<br />\ntrying to tempt me into having my fortune told. - The<br />\nneighborhood. with its bag ladies. peep shows and<br />\nadult book store, had kept me away. In addition,<br />\nshe had never seemed very reputable to me. Maybe<br />\nit was the Strange purple light in the window, with<br />\nplastic fibers sticking out of it. May he it was the<br />\nway she was Plastered With make-up. Lit her way,<br />\nI had very little faith in her ability to foresee the<br />\nf inure. and I approached her salon with a less than<br />\nobjective at'nude.<br />\nShe did have one thing going for her, however.<br />\nShe looked like a palm reader. With the dark skin<br />\nand the big gold earrings of a :gypsy, she fit the<br />\nstereotype perfect ly. Her shifty eyes seemed to know<br />\nsomething that I didn't (namely, that I would he<br />\nthree dollars short after my visit).<br />\nWhen I knocked on the door of her shop, which<br />\nwas locked, I was surprised to find her reluctant to<br />\nlei me in. She opened the door a crack and looked<br />\nat me suspiciously. She asked me what I wanted and<br />\nI told her I wanted my palm read. A young woman,<br />\nwho I assume was her daughter, said something to<br />\nher in a language that I had never heard beforell<br />\nsuppose it was Romanian). The daughter had obviously learned to apply make-up from her mother.<br />\nThe palm reader, after discussion with her daughter,<br />\nagreed to let me in. The daughter seemed even more<br />\nsuspicious than her mother, and together they formed one of the more unfriendly pairs of businesswomen I have come across. I felt uncomfortable as she led me to her waiting room, and I began<br />\nto wish I hadn't come. Heather, my female companion, reluctantly followed.<br />\nThe large waiting room was unlike any room I<br />\nhad ever been in before. The decor can only be<br />\nlikened to that of a brothel. We sat down on a red<br />\nvelvet couch. The poorly lit room was dominated<br />\nby red velvet. There were red velvet chairs, red<br />\nvelvet couches, red velvet lamps and red velvet<br />\nheart-shaped chairs, all of which sat on the plush,<br />\nred shag carpet. The only thing that brought any<br />\n<br />\nnormalcy to the room was the large color TV in the<br />\ncorner, broadcasting the evening news. At one end<br />\nof the room was an alcove with a bed in it, separated<br />\nby strings of plastic beads (I have no idea of the<br />\npurpose of this room). There were also shoes on the<br />\nfloor near the entrance. By the time I saw the shoes,<br />\nI was having very serious doubts about the validity<br />\nof the palm reader. I was also having serious,doubts<br />\nabout our safety.<br />\nHeather and I were glad to have our turn with<br />\nthe palm reader, our eyes having been numbed by<br />\nplastic and red velvet. We agreed to have our palms<br />\nread together (it isn't any cheaper that way,<br />\nthough). We sat down, and the palm reader said<br />\nin a heavily accented voice,\"Put two dollars in your<br />\npalm and make a wish,\" which we did. I couldn't<br />\nhelp but notice that she had enormously large false<br />\neyelashes, looking as though they might fall off at<br />\nany moment. Her liberal use of mascara was also<br />\noverwhelming.<br />\n<br />\nShe began with Heather's palm. \"You will live<br />\nto be 95,\" she predicted. It sounded a bit typical<br />\nto me, but I was willing to go along with it. \"Do<br />\nyou understand?\" she asked Heather, to which<br />\nHeather nodded. \"You are honest,\" she went on,<br />\n\"and you don't like being hossed around. Do you<br />\nunderstand?\" She then went on to describe<br />\nHeather's love life, saying that she loved two men,<br />\none light and the other dark, and one loved hex very<br />\nmuch. She also said that she would marry and have<br />\ntwo children, a girl and a boy. A few more details<br />\nand several \"Do you understand's\" later, Heather's<br />\nfortune had been told. During all of this, I had been<br />\nwondering it' the palm reader got a discount on<br />\nmake-up.<br />\nIt was now my turn. She took my hand, examined my knuckles, and said,\"You will live a long life.<br />\nYou are honest, and you don't like to be bossed<br />\naround. Do you understand?\" This all seemed<br />\nfamiliar to me for some reason. She then went on<br />\nto say that I would be successful and that someday<br />\nI would own a car (which seemed like a safe bet to...<br />\nme\u2014the car part, that is). She did know, however,<br />\nthat I was depressed about school, and she predicted<br />\nthat I would do better. She then said that I liked<br />\none girl very much, but that I didn't think she was<br />\nhonest. The palm reader was finished with my fortune, and I now saw my destiny ahead of me.<br />\nShe said she would pray for us it' we each put a<br />\ndollar in our palms and made a wish. We reluctantly<br />\nagreed, and I went on to silently wish that she<br />\nwouldn't ask for any more money. She thanked us<br />\nboth and said \"God bless you.\" I asked her for a<br />\nbusiness card, but her daughter quickly said<br />\nsomething to her in a foreign language and she said<br />\nshe couldn't give me one. The palm reader told us<br />\nto come back again and bring our friends, and as<br />\nwe left she quickly shut the door behind us.<br />\nLooking back on the palm reader now, I suggest<br />\nthat anyone seeking an interesting experience and<br />\nwilling to brave the neighborhood and enormous<br />\namounts of red velvet should go to see her (her shop<br />\nis near the Charles Theater). I don't know how accurate her forecasts are, although Heather and I<br />\nlater realized that several of the things she said in<br />\nregard to school and such came true. One thing I<br />\ndo know for sure: someday, somewhere, I'm going to be an old, successful man with a car.<br />\n<br />\n\fotic Psychopaths And Single Drafts<br />\n<br />\nwho ultimately sacrifices himself. And it's a kind<br />\nof quiet decision. Anyway, whenoer I direct the<br />\npb I trN to run counter to the notion of Jerry as<br />\nhysterical pschopath. It doesn't have to be acted.<br />\nI find that quite often actors do a lot better in my<br />\nplays by acting against the intention of the lines.<br />\nBecause the lines carry the weight. That's why when<br />\nI direct a play I don't have too much business going on...<br />\nN-L: But don't ou want to support certain<br />\nelements in the character?<br />\nALBEE: Elements of Jerry's intelligence,<br />\nobjectivity\u2014about himself\u2014should be as important<br />\nas anyt hing\u2022else, to balance against the overwhelming despair. In other words. I just didn't want it<br />\nto be a roller-coaster trip; it's got to be more interesting than that, and more complex. Because,<br />\nyou know, if Jerry comes on at the beginning of<br />\nhe play like a gangbuster, Peter's going to get up<br />\nand leave; he's not going to sit there in Central Park<br />\nand put up with that.<br />\nN-L: You want it to mount slowly but gradualk .<br />\nALBEE: Yes. And also enough to trick and hypnotize Peter; if it's something that's going to scare<br />\nhim too much\u2014you know, you can tell if somebody's psychopathic\u2014you get up and you leave. It's<br />\ngot to be something that we become aware of instinctively and gradually just a little bit before Peter<br />\ndoes.<br />\nN-L: Okay. Have any directors of the play other<br />\nthan yourself tended to see something else, something a little different that perhaps has intrigued<br />\nyou?<br />\nALBEE: If you're a writer who has an absolute<br />\nvision in your mind when you write the piece\u2014of<br />\nwhat you want them to look like, what you want<br />\nthem to sound like, and what effect you want the<br />\naudience to have\u2014then the responsibility of the<br />\ndirector and the actors is to accommodate that. I've<br />\nseen lots of directors in lots of my plays who have<br />\ntried to impose their personality on them; and<br />\ngenerally speaking they end up doing, I suppose,<br />\na reasonably interesting production, but a wrong<br />\none. I write very precisely and very tightly, and .1<br />\nknow exactly what I'm after. Now it's quite possible that what I want is not going to be quite as effective as what somebody else wants... but I'm<br />\nmuch more interested in what I want.<br />\nN-L: Certainly.<br />\nALBEE: But not all writers are like that. Look<br />\nat Lanford Wilson, for example. I think Lanford<br />\nwrites his plays a little more loosely than I do, and<br />\nprobably takes a lot more ideas from his directors<br />\nand his actors than 1 would. Everybody writes<br />\n<br />\ndifferently.<br />\nN-L: I caught an article on Sam Shephard in New<br />\nYork magazine some time back, and the most interesting thing that he had to say is that when he's<br />\nwriting a play he sees distinct, complete images as<br />\nhe goes along.<br />\nALBEE: Sure; most playwrights do, I would say.<br />\nIf the characters aren't three-dimensional in your<br />\nmind, or the environment that they're in on stage<br />\nisn't clear to you, you're not going to be writing<br />\nvery clearly. You should wait until all those things<br />\nare clear before you write anything down.<br />\nN-L: Do you work from a scenario? Do you<br />\nlay<br />\nout anything?<br />\nALBEE: No. I find that the quickest way for me<br />\nto forget anything is to write it down. And anything<br />\nthat I can't keep in my head is probably not worth<br />\nthinking about.<br />\nN-L: And do you work on different parts at the<br />\nsame time, or do you switch around\u2014<br />\n<br />\nwhich are different time durations; you can<br />\ncapitalize, you can underline, you can italicize,<br />\nwhich is single, double and triple forte. You can<br />\nnotate as precisely as a composer can.<br />\n. N-L: As precisely?<br />\nALBEE: Just about, I would say. Also with a<br />\nsense of your words. For example, let's take a<br />\nperfectly simple sentence: \"I wonder why I went<br />\nto the store?\" Okay? If you underline the word<br />\nwent\u2014\"I wonder why I went to the store?\"\u2014or<br />\nyou underline the word store\u2014\"I wonder why 1<br />\nwent to the store?\"\u2014those are two different meanings, totally different meanings. And you change<br />\nthe meaning entirely depending on which word you<br />\nunderline. This is something I learned from Chekov,<br />\nBecket, other people who notate terribly precisel.N.<br />\nI wanted to be a composer when I was a kid; I was<br />\nincompetent, and so I never became one. I started<br />\nlistening to serious music when I was about ten or<br />\neleven. It's an important part of my life. And when<br />\nyou read a play, if you read a play properly, you<br />\nhear it when you read it; even when you're seeing<br />\na play, sitting in an audience, watching the play,<br />\nI suspect\u2014as opposed to film, which you get mostly<br />\nthrough your eyes \u2014even when you're watching a<br />\nplay, I think you're really getting it through the ear.<br />\nN-L: Do you try to establish a particular rhythm<br />\nof speech for each separate character?<br />\nALBEE: Well, not specifically a rhythm; but no<br />\ntwo characters speak alike.<br />\nN-L: And how do you go about delineating this?<br />\nALBEE: You get to know the characters and you<br />\nhear the way they talk. If you write two characters<br />\nwho talk exactly alike, they'd better be identical<br />\ntwins.<br />\nN-L: And how do you convey this?<br />\nALBEE: Through the language; the kind of<br />\nsentences they use. Some people talk in short<br />\nsentences, others in long; some talk in broken<br />\nphrases; some have large vocabularies, some have<br />\nsmall vocabularies. Everybody's different.<br />\nN-L: And all that becomes clear to you.<br />\nALBEE: If I know the characters well enough,<br />\nthen I know the differences in the way they talk.<br />\nN-L: In any of your works have you had trouble<br />\ngetting to know the characters well enough?<br />\nALBEE: No, I don't start writing a piece down<br />\nuntil I know them very well.<br />\nN-L: And you have a clear conception of the<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nALBEE: The nature of the characters, yes. But<br />\nthings-1 reveal things to myself about the<br />\ncharacters as 1 write them, things that I've obviously<br />\nalready known, without knowing that 1 know them.<br />\n.N-L: Can you say that you draw characters from<br />\npeople whom you know or from things that you've<br />\nseen?<br />\nALBEE: I've never been able to figure that out.<br />\n<br />\neatures<br />\n<br />\nALBEE: No, I write from the beginning to the<br />\nend.<br />\nN-L: How many drafts do you go through?<br />\nA LBEE: One.<br />\nN-L: Really?<br />\nALBEE: And then I'll retype it. And the revisions<br />\nI make in rehearsal are basically cuts; very few<br />\nadditions.<br />\nN-L: How does one go about developing one's<br />\nown voice?<br />\nALBEE: I don't think you can; I don't think it's<br />\nanything you can learn. You either have it or you<br />\ndon't; you find it within yourself.<br />\nN-L: All right, I'd like to talk about rhythm.<br />\nYou've spoken a lot about the conformity between<br />\ndrama and music.<br />\nALBEE: \"All art aspires to music.\"<br />\nN-L: In a number of your plays I get a rhythm<br />\nof the language clearly from the text, just through<br />\nyour technique of punctuation.<br />\nALBEE: Well, come on! You punctuate exactly<br />\nthe same way a composer notates. You've got all<br />\nthese wonderful commas and semicolons, all of<br />\n<br />\nI think I make them up.<br />\nN-L: I've noticed in your plays that while most<br />\neverything is very carefully constructed\u2014the<br />\ncharacters, dialogue, conflict, tension\u2014you're very<br />\nspare in delineating action.<br />\nALBEE: I'm not spare in delineating action.<br />\nN-L: Excuse me. What I meant by \"action\" was<br />\nthe very simplistic type of action, like \"He gets up<br />\nfrom the couch and moves to the bar.\"<br />\nALBEE: There's such a difference. A part of<br />\nthat, the majority of that, is contained within the<br />\ndialogue. Urgencies to move or stand still, get up<br />\nor sit down, are contained invisibly in the emotional<br />\ncontent of the lines. They're there. You don't even<br />\nhave to put them down.

He says<br />\nthat estimates as to how much<br />\nmight be raised during the campaign would be premature, but<br />\nnotes that privately offered suggestions range from $300 to<br />\n$450 million.<br />\nIn the next several days the<br />\nProvost's Office will be receiving all of the 12 to 15 planning<br />\ndocuments prepared for the upcoming campaign. In addition<br />\nto documents from the institutions' eight divisions, other<br />\ndocuments, such as for the<br />\nlibrary, financial aid, and student life will be turned in. A<br />\npreliminary assessment of these<br />\nreports' findings will be done<br />\nby the Joint Trustee Development Committee which is made<br />\nup of trustee members from<br />\nboth the University and the<br />\nHospital.<br />\nFrom November 5 to 7, the<br /><br />\nBoard of Trustees will meet in<br />\na special session to consider the<br />\nprogress of planning for the<br />\ncampaign. By that time, says<br />\nAssistant Provost Steven McClain, his office hopes to<br />\n\"identify the major needs [of<br />\nthe institutions] over the next 15<br />\nto 20 years.\" Among the major<br />\nneeds that McClain said may be<br />\nreadily identifiable were construction and renovation requirements, as well as other excont. on p. 7<br /><br />\nPresident Steven Muller has not<br />\nannounced any candidates for<br />\nthe position, several members<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences of the Academic Council have<br />\nSigmund Suskind announced indicated that they would prefer<br />\nhis resignation Wednesday at someone from within the faculthe Academic-Council meeting. ty, rather than an administrator<br />\nHis term as dean will end in from outside the university.<br />\nJune when he will return to his<br />\nAlthough the choice of a new<br />\nformer position of professor in dean is up to the president,<br />\nthe Department of Biology.<br />\nSuskind said that the opinions<br />\nthe faculty are \"very imA brief biography of Sig- of<br />\nportant.\"<br />\nmund Suskind appears on page 7.<br />\nSuskind says that he believes<br />\nSuskind, who has been a that \"integrity\" is the most imdean for 12 years, said that it portant quality that the new<br />\nwas \"never my intention to dean must possess.

According to Assistant Dean for Academic<br />\nStudies Martha Roseman,<br />\n\"students now feel that 'if I<br />\ndon't do well, I'll ,take it<br />\npass/fail; if I do well, I'll take<br />\nit for a grade.' \" Although<br />\nrepresenting a change in<br />\nphilosophy, Roseman does<br />\nnot feel that the alternative<br />\ngrading system has been<br />\nabused.<br />\nThe worst problem occurs<br />\nwhen students attempt to<br />\nchange their pass/fail decisions beyond the last date to<br /><br />\ndo so or even after the<br />\nsemester's grades have been<br />\nrecorded. \"Students that<br />\ndon't do well come to me and<br />\nbeg or even have a faculty<br />\nmember recommend that<br />\ngrades be changed to<br />\npass/fail,\" said Roseman.

The announcement of the<br />\nresignation of Sigmund Suskind, the Dean<br />\nof Arts and Sciences, offers an opportunity<br />\nto raise questions concerning Suskind's<br />\nreplacement and the organization of the<br />\ndeans' administrative structure.<br />\nThe immediate problem is the selection of<br />\na successor to Suskind. The importance of<br />\nthe dean of Arts and Sciences to the<br />\nacademic life of most Hopkins students<br />\nnecessitates that undergraduate concerns are<br />\nconsidered in the deliberations to pick the<br />\nnew dean. Preferably, the new dean should<br />\nbe young, innovative and enthusiastic about<br />\nreforming undergraduate education. The<br />\nundergraduate curriculum is likely to undergo revisions during the next few years and<br />\nthe Dean of Arts and Sciences must play a<br />\ncritical role. Not only should the new dean<br />\nhe receptive to student input, but he must<br />\nalso have a clear vision of the necessary<br />\ndirection that undergraduate education must<br />\ntake. Finally, the new dean must demonstrate sensitivity to the humanities and social<br />\nsciences, areas that are destined for trouble<br />\nduring the upcoming years. Because the<br /><br />\nHomewood deans' office is primarily stacked with personnel from scientific and<br />\ntechnological backgrounds, an appointment<br />\nof a non-science person would produce a<br />\nmore equitable balance.<br />\nIn addition to finding a suitable candidate<br />\nfor the vacant position, Suskind's departure<br />\nprovides an excellent opportunity to reevaluate the structure of the Homewood<br />\ndeans' office. Last year's reorganization has<br />\nsince proved to be problematic. The lack of<br />\none central leader has produced confusion.<br />\nThe present structure is administratively<br />\nunique because the top of the hierarchy is<br />\nshared by two deans. Overlapping jurisdictions and the lack of ultimate authority has<br />\nproduced confusion and complaint from<br />\nfaculty and students. Perhaps the best solution would be to augment the role of the Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences, placing him at the top of<br />\nof the deans' hierarchy. This would make<br />\nit easier for students to transmit complaints<br />\nand reach solutions to problems with the<br />\nadministration.

(I ended my beer-drinking phase<br />\nupon reaching 21 years.) And<br />\nsince coffee is drunk for the<br />\nbetter part of the day (and<br />\nnight), it is this beverage to<br />\nwhich I'll devote myself here.<br />\nAlthough I've long been a<br />\ncoffee-drinker (weaned on<br />\ncoffee-milk during kindergarten days by my patient and persistent father, to whom this<br />\npiece is dedicated), my consumption habits became fixed<br />\nduring my early days at college,<br />\nlike so many others. During the<br />\nfirst semester of freshman year<br />\nthere are two basic types of coffee drinkers. The first group includes those who rarely drank<br />\nit before, but begin to preceding<br />\nthe first major exams. These<br />\nconsumers often cannot discern<br />\nlevels of quality; to them it all<br />\ntastes like brackish swamp<br />\nwater. Thus, massive amounts<br />\nof cream and sugar are added<br />\nto render the coffee palatable.<br />\n(Wouldn't it be easier to pop a<br />\nfew No-Doz or some speed?)<br />\nMembers of the second group<br />\nare already confirmed guzzlers<br />\nwho are sent on a quest for the<br />\nbest, cheapest, or most available coffee on campus. At<br />\nHopkins there are only a few<br />\n\"coffee-ing holes,\" mostly dictated by location and time of<br />\nday.<br />\nThe daytime Gilman Coffee<br />\nShop probably leads in quantity; have you ever noticed, the<br />\nfilters lined up already filled<br />\nwith ground coffee waiting to<br />\nbe brewed during mid-morning<br />\ncoffee rush? A truly awesome<br />\nsight. The coffee here is adequate. Also, the adulterator is<br />\nderived from an animal that actually once said, \"Moo,\" so<br /><br />\nthis passes. (Have you ever<br />\nwondered about what \"nondairy\" creamer actually is?) But<br />\nbest of all about the GCS is the<br />\nservers. Yes, the wait in line is<br />\noccasionally agonizing, but<br />\nmost coffee shuttlers here recognize those in need of their<br />\nmorning fix. Upon blithering<br />\n\"GrribdgIburg,\" your \"White<br />\nCap\" has already started to<br />\npour.<br />\nThe nighttime coffee shops<br />\noccupy an entirely different<br />\nniche. These club-operated<br />\nenterprises are a godsend for<br />\nthose in need of coffee while<br />\nstudying on campus at night.

Busy cramming in the<br />\nlibrary, the oply options are the<br />\nSnack Bar (which we won't<br />\neven think about) and the coffee machine on Q-level. I used<br />\nto despise machine coffee until<br />\na compatriot in coffeeology<br />\nclued me in to his secret. He<br />\nclaims that drinking machine<br />\ncoffee all depends on your at-<br /><br />\ntitude and expectations. If you<br />\nexpect it to be good to the last<br />\ndrop, you'll be rudely disappointed. Instead, don't even<br />\nconsider the beverage dispensed from the many-buttoned<br />\nmachine as coffee. Just call it<br />\n\"coffee-drink,\" in the same<br />\nway that orange drink is<br />\nanalogous to orange juice. Of<br />\ncourse coffee-drink must contain minimum of 10 percent genuine coffee. A refreshment<br />\ncontaining less than 10 percent<br />\nconstitutes \"coffee-ade.\" Finally, \"bionic coffee\u2014 is 100 percent synthesized by man, and<br />\nnothing in it has ever lived, including sugar and milk.<br />\nThere's little to say about<br />\nLevering cafeteria coffee except<br />\nthat it's there and passes the<br />\nsipping test.

Somehow<br />\nit's more tactful to arrive at a<br />\nseminar with one large-sized<br />\ncup rather than several smallersized versions lined up on the<br />\ndesk like so much artillery.<br />\nWhile two or three 8-ounce<br />\ncups look like a direct challenge<br />\nto the professor to lecture as<br />\ndryly as possible, one 16-ounce<br />\nsize is perfectly acceptable.<br />\nFinally, there are many areas<br />\nfor personal experience with<br />\ncoffee, many quite innovative.<br />\nA group of three friends used<br />\nto concoct their own version of<br />\nkahlua using grain alchohol,<br />\nvery strong coffee, sugar and<br />\nvanilla. Thus armed, they<br />\nwould attend Friday morning<br />\nclasses happily (and end up<br />\nhaving bizarre debates with the<br />\nprofessor which seemed to<br />\nmake little sense to anyone else<br />\nin the room). To me, Reading<br />\nWeek is defined by sunbathing,<br />\ntrashy novels and large jars filled with the strongest (occasionally spiked) iced coffee. So<br />\njust use your imagination, and<br />\nthe possibilities are infinite.<br />\nAnd remember, the effects of<br />\ncoffee-abuse are often a lot<br />\nmilder than those of overindulgence of other substances<br />\nfor veteran indulgers.<br /><br />\nPAGE 6/APRIL<br /><br />\n8, 1983,<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nSpring Is Ignorant About Facts Of Freeze<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nwas very surprised by Professor David Spring's letter<br />\nconcerning the nuclear freeze<br />\nwhich was published in the NewsLeiler of March 11. Referring to<br />\nProfessor David's lecture on<br />\nthe freeze, he says that two<br />\nmain points of this lecture were<br />\n\"illogical.\" The first of these<br />\npoints is Professor David's<br />\nstipulation that the freeze, by<br />\nfreezing nuclear offensive<br />\ncapabilities but not defensive<br />\nmeasures, would undermine<br />\nour deterrence. Professor<br />\nSpring sees this as \"illogical\"<br />\nbecause \"surely [the freezel<br />\nwould strengthen deterrence on<br />\ntwo grounds.\" From this statement, it is quite evident that<br />\nProfessor Spring is totally ignorant as to what deterrence is<br />\nreally all about. Deterrence,<br />\nwhich has been the United<br />\nStates policy with regard to<br />\nnuclear weapons for many<br />\nyears now, is based upon survivable second-sirike nuclear<br />\nforces. In order for both superpowers to feel secure in the age<br />\nof nuclear weapons, each side<br />\nmust feel that it would still have<br />\nthe capability to cause unacceptable damage to its adversary<br />\neven after it has been hit with<br />\na first strike. This is known as<br />\n\"mutually-assumed destruction,\" and while it is a rather<br />\nhorrible-sounding name, it has<br />\nproven to be effective in deterring the use of nuclear weapons<br />\n(so far!). In order to do this,<br />\neach side must maintain nuclear<br />\nwarheads which they know will<br />\nnot all be destroyed in the event<br />\nhat the other side should<br /><br />\ndecide to strike first. As long as<br />\nthese \"survivable second-strike<br />\nforces\" are maintained, both<br />\nsides will realize that if they<br />\nwere to strike first, they would<br />\ncertainly bring unacceptable<br />\ndamage upon themselves. Hence,<br />\nneither side will strike, and<br />\ndeterrence has succeeded.<br />\nHow does the freeze undermine this deterrence? By allowing each side to develop defensive weapons, such as antiballistic missiles, lasers capable<br />\nof destroying warheads in<br />\nflight, etc., the freeze could<br />\npossibly enable one (or both)<br />\nnations to achieve total invulnerability from the adversary's missiles. Once this has<br />\noccured, deterrence will be obsolete, because there will be no<br />\nthreat to prevent a first strike.<br />\nThe nation that struck first<br />\ncould annihilate its opponent<br />\nand defend itself with the defensive weapons that it had<br />\ndeveloped. There would be nothing to deter them.<br />\nEvidently Professor Spring i<br />\nignorant of these rather important facts. This brings us to his<br />\nnext point. He says of Professor David's lecture: \"The<br />\nimplication is that only experts<br />\nhave the right to speak on<br />\nnuclear defense.\" Of course, in<br />\na democracy with guaranteed<br />\nfreedom of speech such as ours,<br />\n_everyone has the right to speak<br />\non any subject s/he wishes.

The<br />\n3-credit Evening College course,<br />\n\"Feasibility and Implementation of Robotic Systems,\" was<br />\ntaught by Barry Whitman and<br />\nWendell Leimbach.<br />\nSince the course was designed for masters in administrative<br />\nscience degree students, it did<br />\nnot go too deeply into the<br />\ntechnical aspects of robots. Instead, it focused on the use of<br />\nrobots in industry. Whitman<br />\nsaid that robots are used for the<br />\n\"three D's: Dirty work, Dull<br />\nwork and Dangerous work.\"<br />\nWhitman also said \"the class is<br />\na mind-stretching thing.\". People must. know what will happen if companies use robotic<br />\nsystems to replace the workforce, Whitman explained.<br />\nOne management problem<br />\nthat Whitman cited was that, in<br />\nthe future, factories may not<br />\nneed as many parking spaces,<br />\nas there will be fewer workers.<br />\nHe pointed out, however, that<br />\nfactories will always need<br />\nworkers to keep the robots<br />\nrunning.<br />\nOne of the robots used in<br />\nSaturday's demonstration was<br />\nreally just a working arm. The<br />\nmini-robot, which is made by<br />\nUnimation and sells for $8(100,<br />\nis run by an Apple computer. It<br />\nis a model of the type of robot<br />\ntypically found in the workplace.The other robot was a<br />\n\"R2-D2 look-alike,\" according<br />\nto Whitman. The robot, borrowed from Equitable Bank actually is just used for promotional purposes. Unlike many<br />\nrobots used in industry, it is not<br />\nautomated but is directed by<br />\nradio control. Whitman said he<br />\nused the robot to dispel the<br />\npopular conception of what<br />\nrobot is like.<br />\nThe social implications oi<br />\nrobots was another part of th(<br />\ncourse. Whitman said that thi \u2022<br /><br />\ntopic provoked the most discussion in the classroom. The<br />\npopular theory, according to<br />\nWhitman, was that as robots<br />\ncome, people go. Robots in industry have already displaced<br />\nsome jobs. Yet, according to<br />\nWhitman, the federal government has no plans at all to deal<br />\nwith employees replaced by<br />\nrobots.<br />\nWhitman proposes retraining<br />\nfor those unemployed by robots. He admitted, though, that<br />\nnot all of those unemployed can<br />\nbe retrained. Whitman said,<br />\n\"I believe that the work Force<br />\nis so terrified that the topic cannot he dketissed.\" He explained that the problem goes to the<br />\nvery heart of their existence.<br />\nThe factory has been a part of<br />\ntheir families, and taking the<br />\nwork away is disruptive.

Kun explained, \"It's great<br />\nthat you can have more people<br />\nliving on campus, and it's great<br />\nthat you can try to build a<br />\ngreater sense of community,<br />\nbut this situation, when coupled<br />\nwith other things, such as increased tuition, is a very expensiye proposition.\"<br />\nStudents who choose not to<br />\nlive in University-owned apartments/dorms can research options and housing facilities<br />\navailable to them.

A<br />\nplump Siamese cat pads over to me and rubs her<br />\nneck against my leg.<br />\nAlbee leads us up an iron spiral staircase<br />\n(aquamarine) to the second level, which, when seen<br />\nfrom below, protrudes only partly into the expansiveness of the main room. A huge skylight cuts the<br />\nfar end of the ceiling; we look at it more closely<br />\nfrom the upper level, and Albee mentions that it<br />\nused to be an elevator shaft. We pass through his<br />\nbedroom and enter a small, but high-ceilinged,<br />\nstudy.<br />\nAlbee is wearing cotton slacks and a black shortsleeved polo shirt. He seems to be in fine physical<br />\n\u2022hape: excepting a little paunch, he is well-muscled,<br />\ncan. He has long, straight, streaked-gray hair; a<br />\npair of glasses are angled up on his head as if that<br />\nis their natural perch (though he takes them off to<br />\ntwist absent-mindedly between his fingers every so<br />\noften, while we're talking, he never puts them over<br />\nhis eyes: back they go, up on his head). A bushy<br />\ngray mustache hangs over his mouth. He smiles<br />\ninfrequently\u2014he seems reserved and serious, his<br />\noice low and sonorous\u2014hut when he does, it is<br />\nbroad and friendly , and when I see it in profile, I<br />\nget the curious impression of the grin of a cat. His<br />\ntalk is measured and thoughtful and, like an actor,<br />\nhis voice comes deep from the diaphragm.<br />\nN-L: When I was in high school, Mr. Albee,<br />\nplayed the role of .Jerry in The Zoo .Story; shortly<br />\nthereafter, I noticed an ad in the Times for \"Albee<br />\ndirects Albee\" at Columbia University. So I had<br />\nthe opportunity to sec The Zoo Story and The<br />\nAmerican Dream, as directed by you. Now that I'm<br />\nhere, I can ask you about something specific in the<br />\nproduction which struck me at the time\u2014it concerns<br /><br />\nthe very opening of that production of The Zoo<br />\nStory. You had .Jerry in a tight T-shirt, drinking a<br />\ncan of Coke, a swagger to his walk, and then<br />\nfinishing the can of Coke and tossing it behind his<br />\nhack into a garbage pail before opening his dialogue<br />\nwith Peter. 'That was something completely different from what I had envisioned, and it kind of<br />\nbothered me at first. I had a totally different conception of ,Jerry from what you seemed to convey<br />\nin that opening.<br />\n,4LBEE: What was your conception?<br />\nN-L: I didn't see .Jerry as the cocky, macho type<br />\nof person that was implicit in that sort of arrangement. But that, of course, is entirely subjective...What I've been thinking about is the distinction between the realm of the playwright and that<br />\nof the director, how the two'crafts coincide and<br />\nwhere they div ergc, and how one relates, as a<br />\nplaywright, to the director and vice versa. In regard<br />\nto that particular production, you were both<br />\nplay wright and director.<br />\nALBEE: Let's see now. That very opening was<br />\njust a bit of business that th, actor wanted to do,<br />\n.ind I didn't see any reason why he shouldn't go<br />\n..vith his instinct; he seemed quite capable of walk<br />\ning, thinking and drinking a Coke at the same time.<br />\nIt was meant to indicate no particular attitude about<br />\nanything; if he'd tossed it on the ground rather than<br />\nin the trash can, I suppose that might have indicated<br />\nsomething. The fact that he tossed it in the trash<br />\ncan indicates a kind of neatness-, I suppose. But the<br />\nbasic thing I was after in the Production was... I've<br />\nseen other people direct it, and too often Jerry is<br />\ndirected and acted as being a psychopath, as being<br />\nalready a suicide, already at the end. What I've<br />\nalways seen him as is too sane, a teacher. somebod<br /><br />\nPalmists Read Palms Among Red Velvet<br />\nBY DAVID HUDACEK<br />\nI had serious doubts as I neared the salon of the<br />\npalm reader on ('harks Street. On my occasional<br />\nj:111111s 10 the Charles I heater, I had seen the palm<br />\nIcader sitting by the window of her shop, pointing<br />\nto me amid Ihen curling her finger Iowa'ds herself,<br />\ntrying to tempt me into having my fortune told. - The<br />\nneighborhood. with its bag ladies. peep shows and<br />\nadult book store, had kept me away. In addition,<br />\nshe had never seemed very reputable to me. Maybe<br />\nit was the Strange purple light in the window, with<br />\nplastic fibers sticking out of it. May he it was the<br />\nway she was Plastered With make-up. Lit her way,<br />\nI had very little faith in her ability to foresee the<br />\nf inure. and I approached her salon with a less than<br />\nobjective at'nude.<br />\nShe did have one thing going for her, however.<br />\nShe looked like a palm reader. With the dark skin<br />\nand the big gold earrings of a :gypsy, she fit the<br />\nstereotype perfect ly. Her shifty eyes seemed to know<br />\nsomething that I didn't (namely, that I would he<br />\nthree dollars short after my visit).<br />\nWhen I knocked on the door of her shop, which<br />\nwas locked, I was surprised to find her reluctant to<br />\nlei me in. She opened the door a crack and looked<br />\nat me suspiciously. She asked me what I wanted and<br />\nI told her I wanted my palm read. A young woman,<br />\nwho I assume was her daughter, said something to<br />\nher in a language that I had never heard beforell<br />\nsuppose it was Romanian). The daughter had obviously learned to apply make-up from her mother.<br />\nThe palm reader, after discussion with her daughter,<br />\nagreed to let me in. The daughter seemed even more<br />\nsuspicious than her mother, and together they formed one of the more unfriendly pairs of businesswomen I have come across. I felt uncomfortable as she led me to her waiting room, and I began<br />\nto wish I hadn't come. Heather, my female companion, reluctantly followed.<br />\nThe large waiting room was unlike any room I<br />\nhad ever been in before. The decor can only be<br />\nlikened to that of a brothel. We sat down on a red<br />\nvelvet couch. The poorly lit room was dominated<br />\nby red velvet. There were red velvet chairs, red<br />\nvelvet couches, red velvet lamps and red velvet<br />\nheart-shaped chairs, all of which sat on the plush,<br />\nred shag carpet. The only thing that brought any<br /><br />\nnormalcy to the room was the large color TV in the<br />\ncorner, broadcasting the evening news. At one end<br />\nof the room was an alcove with a bed in it, separated<br />\nby strings of plastic beads (I have no idea of the<br />\npurpose of this room). There were also shoes on the<br />\nfloor near the entrance. By the time I saw the shoes,<br />\nI was having very serious doubts about the validity<br />\nof the palm reader. I was also having serious,doubts<br />\nabout our safety.<br />\nHeather and I were glad to have our turn with<br />\nthe palm reader, our eyes having been numbed by<br />\nplastic and red velvet. We agreed to have our palms<br />\nread together (it isn't any cheaper that way,<br />\nthough). We sat down, and the palm reader said<br />\nin a heavily accented voice,\"Put two dollars in your<br />\npalm and make a wish,\" which we did. I couldn't<br />\nhelp but notice that she had enormously large false<br />\neyelashes, looking as though they might fall off at<br />\nany moment. Her liberal use of mascara was also<br />\noverwhelming.<br /><br />\nShe began with Heather's palm. \"You will live<br />\nto be 95,\" she predicted. It sounded a bit typical<br />\nto me, but I was willing to go along with it. \"Do<br />\nyou understand?\" she asked Heather, to which<br />\nHeather nodded. \"You are honest,\" she went on,<br />\n\"and you don't like being hossed around. Do you<br />\nunderstand?\" She then went on to describe<br />\nHeather's love life, saying that she loved two men,<br />\none light and the other dark, and one loved hex very<br />\nmuch. She also said that she would marry and have<br />\ntwo children, a girl and a boy. A few more details<br />\nand several \"Do you understand's\" later, Heather's<br />\nfortune had been told. During all of this, I had been<br />\nwondering it' the palm reader got a discount on<br />\nmake-up.<br />\nIt was now my turn. She took my hand, examined my knuckles, and said,\"You will live a long life.<br />\nYou are honest, and you don't like to be bossed<br />\naround. Do you understand?\" This all seemed<br />\nfamiliar to me for some reason. She then went on<br />\nto say that I would be successful and that someday<br />\nI would own a car (which seemed like a safe bet to...<br />\nme\u2014the car part, that is). She did know, however,<br />\nthat I was depressed about school, and she predicted<br />\nthat I would do better. She then said that I liked<br />\none girl very much, but that I didn't think she was<br />\nhonest. The palm reader was finished with my fortune, and I now saw my destiny ahead of me.<br />\nShe said she would pray for us it' we each put a<br />\ndollar in our palms and made a wish. We reluctantly<br />\nagreed, and I went on to silently wish that she<br />\nwouldn't ask for any more money. She thanked us<br />\nboth and said \"God bless you.\" I asked her for a<br />\nbusiness card, but her daughter quickly said<br />\nsomething to her in a foreign language and she said<br />\nshe couldn't give me one. The palm reader told us<br />\nto come back again and bring our friends, and as<br />\nwe left she quickly shut the door behind us.<br />\nLooking back on the palm reader now, I suggest<br />\nthat anyone seeking an interesting experience and<br />\nwilling to brave the neighborhood and enormous<br />\namounts of red velvet should go to see her (her shop<br />\nis near the Charles Theater). I don't know how accurate her forecasts are, although Heather and I<br />\nlater realized that several of the things she said in<br />\nregard to school and such came true. One thing I<br />\ndo know for sure: someday, somewhere, I'm going to be an old, successful man with a car.<br /><br />\notic Psychopaths And Single Drafts<br /><br />\nwho ultimately sacrifices himself. And it's a kind<br />\nof quiet decision. Anyway, whenoer I direct the<br />\npb I trN to run counter to the notion of Jerry as<br />\nhysterical pschopath. It doesn't have to be acted.<br />\nI find that quite often actors do a lot better in my<br />\nplays by acting against the intention of the lines.<br />\nBecause the lines carry the weight. That's why when<br />\nI direct a play I don't have too much business going on...<br />\nN-L: But don't ou want to support certain<br />\nelements in the character?<br />\nALBEE: Elements of Jerry's intelligence,<br />\nobjectivity\u2014about himself\u2014should be as important<br />\nas anyt hing\u2022else, to balance against the overwhelming despair. In other words. I just didn't want it<br />\nto be a roller-coaster trip; it's got to be more interesting than that, and more complex. Because,<br />\nyou know, if Jerry comes on at the beginning of<br />\nhe play like a gangbuster, Peter's going to get up<br />\nand leave; he's not going to sit there in Central Park<br />\nand put up with that.<br />\nN-L: You want it to mount slowly but gradualk .<br />\nALBEE: Yes. And also enough to trick and hypnotize Peter; if it's something that's going to scare<br />\nhim too much\u2014you know, you can tell if somebody's psychopathic\u2014you get up and you leave. It's<br />\ngot to be something that we become aware of instinctively and gradually just a little bit before Peter<br />\ndoes.<br />\nN-L: Okay. Have any directors of the play other<br />\nthan yourself tended to see something else, something a little different that perhaps has intrigued<br />\nyou?<br />\nALBEE: If you're a writer who has an absolute<br />\nvision in your mind when you write the piece\u2014of<br />\nwhat you want them to look like, what you want<br />\nthem to sound like, and what effect you want the<br />\naudience to have\u2014then the responsibility of the<br />\ndirector and the actors is to accommodate that. I've<br />\nseen lots of directors in lots of my plays who have<br />\ntried to impose their personality on them; and<br />\ngenerally speaking they end up doing, I suppose,<br />\na reasonably interesting production, but a wrong<br />\none. I write very precisely and very tightly, and .1<br />\nknow exactly what I'm after. Now it's quite possible that what I want is not going to be quite as effective as what somebody else wants... but I'm<br />\nmuch more interested in what I want.<br />\nN-L: Certainly.<br />\nALBEE: But not all writers are like that. Look<br />\nat Lanford Wilson, for example. I think Lanford<br />\nwrites his plays a little more loosely than I do, and<br />\nprobably takes a lot more ideas from his directors<br />\nand his actors than 1 would. Everybody writes<br /><br />\ndifferently.<br />\nN-L: I caught an article on Sam Shephard in New<br />\nYork magazine some time back, and the most interesting thing that he had to say is that when he's<br />\nwriting a play he sees distinct, complete images as<br />\nhe goes along.<br />\nALBEE: Sure; most playwrights do, I would say.<br />\nIf the characters aren't three-dimensional in your<br />\nmind, or the environment that they're in on stage<br />\nisn't clear to you, you're not going to be writing<br />\nvery clearly. You should wait until all those things<br />\nare clear before you write anything down.<br />\nN-L: Do you work from a scenario? Do you<br />\nlay<br />\nout anything?<br />\nALBEE: No. I find that the quickest way for me<br />\nto forget anything is to write it down. And anything<br />\nthat I can't keep in my head is probably not worth<br />\nthinking about.<br />\nN-L: And do you work on different parts at the<br />\nsame time, or do you switch around\u2014<br /><br />\nwhich are different time durations; you can<br />\ncapitalize, you can underline, you can italicize,<br />\nwhich is single, double and triple forte. You can<br />\nnotate as precisely as a composer can.<br />\n. N-L: As precisely?<br />\nALBEE: Just about, I would say. Also with a<br />\nsense of your words. For example, let's take a<br />\nperfectly simple sentence: \"I wonder why I went<br />\nto the store?\" Okay? If you underline the word<br />\nwent\u2014\"I wonder why I went to the store?\"\u2014or<br />\nyou underline the word store\u2014\"I wonder why 1<br />\nwent to the store?\"\u2014those are two different meanings, totally different meanings. And you change<br />\nthe meaning entirely depending on which word you<br />\nunderline. This is something I learned from Chekov,<br />\nBecket, other people who notate terribly precisel.N.<br />\nI wanted to be a composer when I was a kid; I was<br />\nincompetent, and so I never became one. I started<br />\nlistening to serious music when I was about ten or<br />\neleven. It's an important part of my life. And when<br />\nyou read a play, if you read a play properly, you<br />\nhear it when you read it; even when you're seeing<br />\na play, sitting in an audience, watching the play,<br />\nI suspect\u2014as opposed to film, which you get mostly<br />\nthrough your eyes \u2014even when you're watching a<br />\nplay, I think you're really getting it through the ear.<br />\nN-L: Do you try to establish a particular rhythm<br />\nof speech for each separate character?<br />\nALBEE: Well, not specifically a rhythm; but no<br />\ntwo characters speak alike.<br />\nN-L: And how do you go about delineating this?<br />\nALBEE: You get to know the characters and you<br />\nhear the way they talk. If you write two characters<br />\nwho talk exactly alike, they'd better be identical<br />\ntwins.<br />\nN-L: And how do you convey this?<br />\nALBEE: Through the language; the kind of<br />\nsentences they use. Some people talk in short<br />\nsentences, others in long; some talk in broken<br />\nphrases; some have large vocabularies, some have<br />\nsmall vocabularies. Everybody's different.<br />\nN-L: And all that becomes clear to you.<br />\nALBEE: If I know the characters well enough,<br />\nthen I know the differences in the way they talk.<br />\nN-L: In any of your works have you had trouble<br />\ngetting to know the characters well enough?<br />\nALBEE: No, I don't start writing a piece down<br />\nuntil I know them very well.<br />\nN-L: And you have a clear conception of the<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nALBEE: The nature of the characters, yes. But<br />\nthings-1 reveal things to myself about the<br />\ncharacters as 1 write them, things that I've obviously<br />\nalready known, without knowing that 1 know them.<br />\n.N-L: Can you say that you draw characters from<br />\npeople whom you know or from things that you've<br />\nseen?<br />\nALBEE: I've never been able to figure that out.<br /><br />\neatures<br /><br />\nALBEE: No, I write from the beginning to the<br />\nend.<br />\nN-L: How many drafts do you go through?<br />\nA LBEE: One.<br />\nN-L: Really?<br />\nALBEE: And then I'll retype it. And the revisions<br />\nI make in rehearsal are basically cuts; very few<br />\nadditions.<br />\nN-L: How does one go about developing one's<br />\nown voice?<br />\nALBEE: I don't think you can; I don't think it's<br />\nanything you can learn. You either have it or you<br />\ndon't; you find it within yourself.<br />\nN-L: All right, I'd like to talk about rhythm.<br />\nYou've spoken a lot about the conformity between<br />\ndrama and music.<br />\nALBEE: \"All art aspires to music.\"<br />\nN-L: In a number of your plays I get a rhythm<br />\nof the language clearly from the text, just through<br />\nyour technique of punctuation.<br />\nALBEE: Well, come on! You punctuate exactly<br />\nthe same way a composer notates. You've got all<br />\nthese wonderful commas and semicolons, all of<br /><br />\nI think I make them up.<br />\nN-L: I've noticed in your plays that while most<br />\neverything is very carefully constructed\u2014the<br />\ncharacters, dialogue, conflict, tension\u2014you're very<br />\nspare in delineating action.<br />\nALBEE: I'm not spare in delineating action.<br />\nN-L: Excuse me. What I meant by \"action\" was<br />\nthe very simplistic type of action, like \"He gets up<br />\nfrom the couch and moves to the bar.\"<br />\nALBEE: There's such a difference. A part of<br />\nthat, the majority of that, is contained within the<br />\ndialogue. Urgencies to move or stand still, get up<br />\nor sit down, are contained invisibly in the emotional<br />\ncontent of the lines. They're there. You don't even<br />\nhave to put them down. Any actor will have a sense<br />\nof when a line is meant to be spoken standing up<br />\nor sitting down.<br />\nN-L: Then you simply don't have to bother with<br />\nstage directions for that sort of thing.<br />\nALBLE: The only time I put down stage<br />\ndirections-1 put down far more line readings than<br />\nI do stage directions, you'll notice\u2014is if it's very<br />\ncont. on p. 17<br /><br />\nPAGE 16/APRIL 8, 1983<br /><br />\nThe Meaning of Life<br />\nsiN<br /><br />\nSunday, April 10<br />\nGreat Hall 11 am-1 pm<br />\n$2.50 for all you can eat<br />\nfish officers Michael l'alin, John (Leese and Craham Chapman examine Eric Idle's lack of leg.<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 12<br />\nsubtle glee with which they act out their<br />\nconcoctions.

II<br />\nyou're right, they'll stay on stage until you tell them<br />\nto get off.

One of the studios bought The<br />\nDeath of Bes-sie Smith. I wrote a two-hour<br />\nscreenplay for that, which theN decided was far too<br />\nviolent, and it was never done. But I don't like<br />\nwriting screenplays, because it's not a writer's<br />\nmedium.

Storm<br />\nDavis gave up three runs (two<br />\nunearned) in two innings, and<br />\nTippy Martinez retired the side<br />\nin order in the ninth.<br />\nThree of the Kansas City<br />\nruns were unearned; Dan Ford<br />\nallowed a run to score in the<br />\nfirst inning when he dropped a<br />\nroutine fly ball, and two runs<br />\nscored in the seventh after Cal<br />\nRipkin Jr. fumbled a hard<br />\ngrounder which would have<br />\nbeen the third .out.<br /><br />\nTom Seaver is back!<br /><br />\nBoth Oriole runs were scored<br />\nby Dan Ford. In the first, he<br />\nand Ripkin teamed up with<br />\nback-to-back doubles. In the<br />\nsixth, Ford reached on an error<br />\nby the shortstop, was advanced<br />\nto second when Ripkin walked<br />\nand scored on a base hit by Eddie Murray.<br />\nLarry (Jura was the winner<br />\nfor the Royals, scattering four<br />\nhits in seven innings and alloWing only two runs, one unearned. Dan Quisenberry earned a<br />\nsave by finishing the last two innings giving up two hits. The<br />\nRoyals offense was led by<br />\nGeorge Brett, who doubled,<br />\nhomered and scored three runs.<br />\nWillie Aikens and Jerry Martin<br />\nboth hit solo home runs.<br />\nOn Wednesday, Mike Flanagan was the winner allowing<br />\nseven hits and giving up the<br />\nlone K.C. run on a homer by<br />\nHal McCrae in the second innings. Tim Stoddard came in to<br />\nget the save, pitching the ninth<br />\ninning and allowing only one<br />\nhit.<br />\nDennis Leonard, who took<br />\nthe loss for the Royals, was<br />\nknocked out in the fifth inning.<br />\nCastro and Tufts also saw pitching duty, with the three pitchers<br />\ngiving up a total of 11 runs on 14<br />\nhits. Offensively, the Orioles<br />\nwere led by Al Bumbry, who<br />\nwent two for three, scored four<br />\nruns and stole a base, and John<br />\nLowenstein, who was three for<br />\nfour with three RBI's. Also contributing to the effort were Dan<br />\nFord, Cal Ripkin Jr. and Rich<br />\nDauer, who each went two for<br /><br />\nfive with one RBI.<br />\nLast night's game was rained<br />\nout and will be made up at a<br />\nlated date.

Boa<br />\ngames will be televised beginnin!<br />\nat 2:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nThe depth of the meet was<br />\nsuch that in general a person<br />\nhad to swim faster than the<br />\nsixth-place qualifier to finish<br />\ntwelfth, and faster than the second place qualifier to be sixth.<br />\nFor example, the Blue Jays<br />\n800-yard freestyle relay team<br />\nswam seven seconds faster than<br />\nlast year in the trials, but finished four places lower. In the<br />\n100-yard butterfly, the top six<br />\nfinishers swain faster than the<br />\ntop qualifier. \"Clearly, it was<br />\na very, very fast meet,\" concluded Coach Welsh.<br /><br />\nbrought the Jays seventh place<br />\nin the -400-yard relay. The<br />\n800-yard freestyle relay squad<br />\nof Anderson, Leonhardt, Bangs<br />\nand Tom Kristek placed<br />\neleventh. Also, Bob Britanisky,<br />\nBruce Cairns and Jim Cutrone<br />\nturned in strong performances.<br /><br />\nThe Jays' only winning time<br />\nbelonged to Mike Leonhardt.<br />\nHe won the 1650-yard freestyle<br />\nin 16:04.54. Leonhardt also<br />\nfinished second in the 500-yard<br />\nfreestyle and third in the<br />\n200-yard freestyle.<br />\nOther outstanding indi\u2018idual<br />\nswims included Harvey Allen's<br />\nsecond-place and Wink Dyer's<br />\nseventh-place finishes in the<br />\n1(X)-yard breaststroke. In the<br />\n200-yard backstroke, Harvey<br />\nAllen took second while Wink<br />\nDyer finished tenth. Dick<br />\nJohnson finished in a tie for<br />\nninth place in the 200-yard<br />\nbackstroke.<br />\nThe 100-yard medley relay<br />\nteam of Johnson, Allen, Steve<br />\nSegreto and Leonhardt placed<br />\nfifth. Allen, Leonhardt, Kevin<br />\nAnderson and Dave Bangs<br /><br />\nSecond, they swam their fastest times of the year at the Nationals as planned. Third, they<br />\nwanted to place all three relays<br />\nin the top six. However, the<br />\nmedley relay finished fifth<br />\nwhile the 800-yard and 400yard freestyle relays finished in<br />\nthe top 12.<br /><br />\nOverall, the men's national<br />\nsquad at least partially achieved each of its four seasonal<br />\ngoals. First, the Jays wanted to<br />\nadvance in position; which they<br />\ndid from fifth in '82 to fourth<br />\nin '83.<br /><br />\nFinally, and perhaps most<br />\nimportantly for the future, the<br />\nteam sought to place new faces<br />\nin the finals. Freshman Wink<br />\nDyer and sophomore Dick<br />\nJohnson pulled through. \"But,\"<br />\nCoach Welsh added, \"we had<br />\nhoped for a couple more new<br />\nfaces.
