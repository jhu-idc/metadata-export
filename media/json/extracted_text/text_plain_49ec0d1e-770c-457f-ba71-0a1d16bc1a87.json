These include issue research,<br />\nconstituent relations, speech writing, bill drafting,<br />\ncontact with bureaucratic agencies, or representing their<br />\nsponsor at a community or even a committee meeting.<br />\nXeroxing and envelope stuffing seem to be an inescapable<br />\npart of an intern's life, but is by no means his only<br />\nfunction. State and especially local legislators are often so<br />\nshort on staff- that they can ill afford to waste the<br />\nvaluable resource offered in an intern. The sponsors are<br />\naware of what the intern can do, and are not hesitant to<br />\nutilize him or her.<br />\nAccording to Bob Roach, graduate student<br />\nco-ordinator of the program, \"The legislators are<br />\ninformed that the students are expected to work as<br />\nlegislative or administrative assistants. If we find that a<br />\n<br />\nRichard Pfeffer was denied tenure by the Political<br />\nScience Department last year. He was refused an ad<br />\nhoc committee by the Academic Council this fall.<br />\nMuch has been made of Pfeffer's Marxism--both as a<br />\ncause of why he was rejected and as a reason why he<br />\nshould be retained at this politically conservative<br />\nand academically orthodox university.<br />\nBut the campaign which Pfeffer and his advocates<br />\nhave been waging is a classic case of the Good Old<br />\nCause of liberalism. If Pfeffer were to remain true<br />\nto his Marxist activism, he would have washed his<br />\nhands of this place long ago and kept his job as a<br />\nforklift operator. That, however, is a dilemma of<br />\nradical intellectuals which they rarely happily can<br />\nresolve for themselves. So, wishing to remain within<br />\nthe Ivory Tower, Pfeffer has taken on the liberal<br />\ncoloring of the context in which he is operating.<br />\nBasically, his case comes down to the right of an<br />\nindividualto free expression-however idiosyncratic<br />\nand unorthodox--and to fair review in an essentially<br />\njudicial proceeding. Neither of these rights is given<br />\nvery high priority in Marxist political systems, nor is<br />\nthe individual, per se. The question here is what<br />\npriority are they to be given at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity? Sadly thus far, the answer seems also to<br />\nbe: quite low.<br />\nThe esteemed academic reputation of Johns<br />\nHopkins apparently cannot afford one<br />\nunconventional scholar. The academicians here<br />\napparently cannot tolerate in their midst the<br />\npresence of an aggressive teacher. And the Academic<br />\nCouncil cannot violate the principle of departmental<br />\nautonomy on behalf of a mere individual. That is<br />\nthe final irony of this good old liberal cause: an<br />\nostensibly liberal safeguard of the principle of<br />\nautonomy has protected the integrity of individual<br />\ndepartments and even individuals within<br />\ndepartments against the power of the larger<br />\nuniversity. Now those securely entrenched in power<br />\nhere are using this principle as a shield against one<br />\nindividual's challenge to the integrity of this<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nCan Johns Hopkins meet the challenge? Is this<br />\nuniversity going to yield to<br />\ninternal group pressure and conformity, or is it<br />\ngoing to grant Richard Pfeffer the right to a fair<br />\nCont'd. P. 17.<br />\n<br />\nstudent is not being used in a productive manner the<br />\nsponsor is contacted and an attempt is made to correct his<br />\nor her approach. If necessary, the student would be<br />\nplaced in another office.\" However, throughout the six or<br />\nseven year life span of the program, this latter course of<br />\naction has rarely been necessary. Many of the sponsors<br />\nhave been accepting interns since the conception of the<br />\nprogram, and have developed an appreciation for the<br />\nvalue of the student's contribution. In a few cases,<br />\nstudents develop such a good relationship with the<br />\nlegislator that they will continue contact even after the<br />\ninternship has formally ended-as a volunteer in a political<br />\ncampaign, for example.<br />\nRoach pointed out that the program has built up a<br />\ngood reputation among the state and local legislators, and<br />\n!have more requests: for interns than it can handle. The<br />\nprogram has expanded and now places students with the<br />\nBaltimore County Council, in addition to the City<br />\nCouncil. This year an experimental phase will place some<br />\nstudents with the General Assembly's Legislative Study<br />\nGroup. The primary emphasis will be on issues research,<br />\nbut the students will also be available for spot duty to a<br />\nparticular delegate.<br />\nHopkins generally places 10-12 of its own students per<br />\nyear in the program, but students from UMBC, Towson<br />\nState, and Goucher may also apply bringing the total<br />\nnumber of students involved to an average of 35- 40 per<br />\nHopkins<br />\nyear. The seminars, however, are limited to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nFinally, and probably most important of all, a Hopkins<br />\nstudent can gain more from a political internship than just<br />\nthe increased knowledge of state and local government.<br />\nThe interns are active participants whose ideas and efforts<br />\ncan add to the final product.<br />\nApplications for the Curriculum for Political<br />\nLeadership are available in the Polifical Science<br />\ndepartment office and Room C-2 of the Metro Center<br />\n(basement of Shriver).

Considine<br />\nThe Peabody-Hopkins concert series got off 'to a<br />\nroraring start when pianists Enrique Graf and Katherine<br />\nJacobson performed a duo-piano recital in Shriver Hall<br />\nOctober 1.<br />\nDuo-piano recitals are far from commonplace<br />\noccurances these days, and one suspects this is due as<br />\nmuch from the somewhat limited repertoire as it is from<br />\nthe logistics problem of getting two matched concert<br />\ngrands on the stage at the same time. Surely, there is<br />\nliterature available for one piano, four hands, but it would<br />\nbe foolish to restrict a concert bill to strictly those pieces.<br />\nIs it any wonder, then, that there are but few great<br />\npiano duos in the world today? Alfons and Aloys<br />\nKontarsky, Eden and Tamir, and Walter and Beatriz Klein<br />\nare a few of the great duos, and to those pairs we should<br />\nadd yet another; Graf and Jacobson.<br />\nMr. Graf and Ms. Jacobson are both master students of<br />\nLeon Fleisher, the famed pianist who teacher at the<br />\nPeabody. Their ensemble performances date back to a<br />\nFaculty recital in 1976 (both were on the faculty of the<br />\nPreparatory Department).That performance was so<br />\nsuccessful that the duo was sponsored by the Peabody in<br />\nthe National Piano Ensemble Competition this year,<br />\nwhich they won by unanimous decision of the judges.<br />\nHaving heard them play, one is not surprised. The two<br />\npianists do not play exactly alike; rather, like the<br />\ndifferent sections of an orchestra, they maintain certain<br />\ndistinct timbraltraits, which greatly enhance the sound of<br />\nthe duo. One hears a sense of depth and shading that<br />\nexemplifies the best in pianistic technique, but, because<br />\nof the use of two pianists, the colorisms are expanded on<br />\na grand scale.<br />\nIn this respect, one wishes that the two pianos used in<br />\nthe concert had been better matched. The primary piano<br />\nwas the magnificent German Steinway used by the Shriver<br />\nHall Concert Series. Regrettably, the secondary piano,<br />\n<br />\nwhich was not a bad piano in itself, was so outclassed by<br />\nthe magnificence of sound and clarity of tone generated<br />\nby its German brother, that the two instruments seemed<br />\nalmost like the prince and the pauper. This problem was<br />\navoided at first, as the opening piece in the concert was the<br />\nMozart Sonata in C Major. (K.521) for four hands. With<br />\nMs. Jacobson carrying the bass while Mr. Graf effortlessly<br />\ndelivered the treble, it was a performance of unmistakable<br />\ngrace and sheer Mozartean clarity. One felt that, with an<br />\nopening of such infinite delight, the duo would be<br />\nhard-pressed for a rejoinder.<br />\nHard-pressed, perhaps, but successful nevertheless,<br />\nfor following the Mozart was a stunning reading of<br />\nBeethoven's Sonata 8 in c minor (op. 13), \"Pathetique,\"<br />\nby Mr. Graf.<br />\nAn extreme, yirtuosic sense of dynamics, an insightful<br />\nsense of phrase and robust sense of Romanticism<br />\ncharacterized Mr. Graf's performance. Tossing off phrase<br />\nafter phrase with almost frightening abandon, Mr. Graf<br />\ngave the impression that even the most difficult passages<br />\nwere mere child's play for him.<br />\nIn fact, perhaps the only criticism one might have was<br />\nthat Mr. Graf's playing seemed almost athletic in its sense<br />\nof technical prowess. The piano was often pushed to its<br />\nlimits, its rich sonority verging on clangor.<br />\nBut one need only recall that Beethoven was well<br />\nknown for his pianistic excesses, and his inability to find<br />\nin those puny Viennese pianos a suitable outlet for his<br />\npowerful technique. With this in mind, one seemed to get<br />\nan idea of what the Pathetique sounded like for<br />\nBeethoven, its edges rough and sonorities surging, as Mr.<br />\nGraf eschewed the almost overly polite playing of many<br />\nconcert pianists.<br />\nFollowing the Beethoven was the Brahms Variations on<br />\na Theme be Haydn (op. 56), for two pianos. The work<br />\nseems to be a Peabody favorite, as the Peabody orchestra<br />\nhad performed it a mere four days before. Although the<br />\norchestral version is by far the more popular, one finds<br />\nthat the piano score is ,not, only an easier means of<br />\nfollowing the piece's exposition, and, because of its<br />\n<br />\nlighter tone, generally more pleasing. The performance<br />\neasily did justice to both composer and composition.<br />\nAlexander Scriabin was a Russian prodigy, whose piano<br />\nand orchestral music infused a strong sense of mysticism<br />\ninto a Spartan, if somewhat spatial, romantic esthetic. His<br />\nSonata in f minor (op. 23), which was performed by Ms.<br />\nJacobson, is a technically intriguing work, somehow<br />\nreminiscent of later Liszt, yet not entirely rewarding to<br />\nthe listener.<br />\nThus, it was ample tribute to Ms. Jacobson that she<br />\nmaintained a cogent sense of lyricism that kept the<br />\nlistener's interest while remaining true to the ephemeral<br />\nspirit of the work. In short, a convincing performance of a<br />\nless-than- convincing work.<br />\nFinally, the audience was treated to Ravel's La Valse. A<br />\ntruly orchestral duet, it is better known to most audiences<br />\nin its later orchestral version. Despite the general fondness<br />\nof American audiences for orchestral Ravel, one can easily<br />\ncome to believe that it is through the piano works that he<br />\nis truly to be known<br />\nThe Graf-Jacobson Ravel was truly a knowing<br />\nperformance in that respect, despite having been marred<br />\nby the unequal balance between the two instruments.<br />\nPreviously, Mr. Graf's powerful, crisp playing had<br />\npreviously graced only the German Steinway, while Ms.<br />\nJacobson,performed the Brahms on its American cousin.<br />\nThe difference was not as noticable then, because Ms.<br />\nJacobson's playing was more fluid, less intense than that<br />\nof Mr. Graf, and thus did not tax the American piano.<br />\nBoth piano parts in the Ravel demand the utmost from<br />\ntheir pianos, and thus some of Mr. Graf's rippling glissandi<br />\ndemanded more than his poor keyboard could deliver. In<br />\nRavel, the clarity is of tantamount performance,so such a<br />\nfailure was unfortunately irritating.<br />\nOurtisde of such technical trivialities, though, the<br />\nperformance of the Ravel was admirably authoritative,<br />\nand delightfully crisp. If this concert is indicative of what<br />\nthe Peabody has to give Hopkins, certainly many will be<br />\neagerly awaiting the next offering.<br />\n<br />\n11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1\u2022<br />\nI1I 1 \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI 1I<br />\n\u2022I1\u2022<br />\n1\u20220<br />\nIII01110<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI1<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u202211 0\u2022I.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.10\u2022011<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n11 11<br />\nIII II\u2022<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\n=I\u20221<br />\n=TP<br />\n<br />\nFreshmen Class Elections/Run-offs<br />\nReferendum on the formation of an ad hoc<br />\nabout referedum available<br />\ncommittee for Dr. Pfeffer (Info<br />\nat Student Council office)<br />\nBallot boxes will be located at:<br />\nDorm Snack Bar/Cafeteria 10a.m. - 7p.m.<br />\n<br />\nGilman 10a.m. - 2p.m.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n00<br />\n0.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n000<br />\n.0.<br />\n<br />\n0.<br />\n00.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n..o\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022...<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2014<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nLevering Cafeteria 9a.m. - 2p.m.<br />\n<br />\nLibrary 7p.m. - 11p.m.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nw\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n0101.<br />\n011=<br />\n011110\u20221.11<br />\n....<br />\n1=1000,1b<br />\nMOM/0<br />\n01.=<br />\n1/=.\u2022<br />\n<br />\nResults of the Freshmen Elections<br />\nCandidates in Run-off<br />\n<br />\n=Mb<br />\n'<br />\n0:1\u2022<br />\n\"=.<br />\n00<br />\n<br />\n10.111<br />\n<br />\nPresident<br />\n<br />\n\u2022=0<br />\n<br />\n=1<br />\n<br />\n==<br />\n<br />\nRobert Seder<br />\nMichael Steele<br />\n<br />\nS.C.

I will pay<br />\nparticular attention to its intellectual roots since these are<br />\nnot readily apparent, perhaps unfamiliar and therefore,<br />\nopen to misinterpretation. I shall argue that Pfeffer's<br />\nwork should be located and judged with respect to two<br />\nintellectual traditions which, although important in their<br />\nown right, are quite alien to positive social science as it is<br />\nusually practised in American universities. The first of<br />\nthese traditions relates quite simply to a humanistic<br />\nconcern with the dignity of work and can claim writers<br />\nlike Rousseau, Fourier, Tolstoy, Proudhon and others. I<br />\nshall make particular reference to Simone Well since<br />\ncertain parallels exist between Pfeffer's work and hers.<br />\nThe second tradition is that of Marx with its emphasis<br />\nUpon the construction of a critical science.<br />\nThe problem which Pfeffer addresses is the work<br />\nprocess and its meaning in capitalist society. There is ,of<br />\ncourse, an abundant literature on this and even whole<br />\nsub -discipline swhich seek to deal with certain aspects of<br />\nit. What distinguishes Pfeffer's book is not the problem<br />\naddressed but the manner of his approach and the method<br />\non inquiry. Since these last seem, at first sight, rather<br />\n<br />\nthe camaraderie and hostility, at the same time as she multiplicity of objectives. The first is to show that the<br />\nsought to grapple with \"the evil which wound thought information which Pfeffer has obtained is consistent with<br />\nitself.\" She went to work in the Renault factory in that of other investigators who have examined work for<br />\n1934-5. She left feeling that she was marked for ever with different perspectives using different methods--the direct<br />\nthe brand of slavery, understanding at last how the Stoical interviews of Terkel and Sennett and Cobb, the<br />\nacceptance of the indignity of work was the only possible participant working of Balzer and the more traditional<br />\nsocial science studies as represented by the HEW report<br />\noutcome of submission to the \"invincible and inexorable<br />\non Work in America. The second objective is to critique<br />\n(which<br />\njournal<br />\nfactory<br />\nHer<br />\nlife.<br />\nfactory<br />\noppression\" of<br />\nthe<br />\ninterpretations of others, to contrast the \"liberal\" and<br />\nHannah Arendt praised as \"the most unsentimental<br />\n\"Marxian\"<br />\ninterpretations, to show the inherent weakness<br />\naccount of factory life\" she had ever read) was a turning<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nwhen exposed to the critical tools of the<br />\nformer<br />\nhuman<br />\nthe<br />\non<br />\npoint with regard to her reflections<br />\nlatter and thereby to consolidate the Marxian<br />\ncondition.<br />\ninterpretation. A third objective is to provide a reflective<br />\nPfeffer, in the first two parts of Working for Capitalism<br />\ninterpretation of the work experience using the Marxian<br />\ngives an account of precisely such an \"outrageous<br />\ntools.<br />\ncondensation<br />\norganized<br />\nan<br />\nexperiment.\" The account is<br />\nI judge this part to be less successful than the first two<br />\nof an extensive journal kept day by day while working in<br />\nan industrial plant in South Baltimore. The prose is clear partly because the objectives sometimes get in the way of<br />\nand cogent, free of any sentimentality or pedantry. The each other and partly because of the method of<br />\naccount is lucid and Pfeffer strips away, step by step, the presentation. The material assembled as supportive<br />\nfog that shrouds the mysteries of the work experience-- evidence is strong enough and the Marxian critique of<br />\nthe socialization that takes place in even looking for a job, liberal interpretations comes through superbly at times<br />\nthe training process, the technical aspects of work, the although the quality is here uneven. The reflective<br />\nsocial relationshipswithin the job hierarchy, the concerns interpretation of the work experience is lessstrong and it is<br />\nof workers and the institutional arrangements through in this regard that I judge the work still to be incomplete.<br />\nwhich those concerns are supposed to be expressed. All of The links between the first two parts and the third need<br />\nthese topics are subjected to detailed scrutiny. But the strengthening. The bond between these separate<br />\naccount is much more than that,for this is no work components is crucial to the final interpreatation.<br />\n\u2022 :,9v:4ffi<br />\n<br />\ns<br />\n4.y<br />\n<br />\nKt:V<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nconstructed in the mould of a supposedly objective,<br />\npeculiar, it is important to explain the rationale that lies<br />\nsocial science.Nor is this simply participant<br />\n\"value-free\"<br />\nbehind them.<br />\nobservation. By its very nature, this kind of experiment<br />\nThe universal thread which connects the literature on<br />\nuses the self as an integral element within it. The feelings<br />\nWork in capitalist society is a notion of the gap between<br />\nthe manager and the managed, between the \"bosses\" and<br />\nand thoughts, the careful charting of emotional and<br />\nsubjective responses, the conflicting tensions, all become<br />\nthe \"workers\", between \"us\" and \"them\". This gap gets<br />\nin<br />\ni nternalized within the literature on the problem of embroiled in the experiment. The subject and object<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\nobject<br />\nand<br />\nsubject<br />\nthe experiement. The<br />\n.work itself. A great deal of literature, for example, deals<br />\nexperiment lose their clear separate identity and become<br />\ndirectly with how \"we\" can make \"them\" happier, less<br />\nlocked in a dialectical unity. The struggle then becomes to<br />\nalienated, more cooperative and more productive. Those<br />\nfind a representation of it all which is itself a synthesis of<br />\nwho seek to understand the work process from the inside<br />\nmaterial experience and human response. This Pfeffer<br />\ninevitably end up imposing mental constructs which sit<br />\ndoes admirably. And at the end of the day we are left<br />\nu ncomfortably with the phenomena being described. And<br />\nwith a unique and indelible impression of what working<br />\nthe workers themselves often seem incapable of<br />\nfor capitalism is like, as experienced on the front line.<br />\narticulating their feelings. The reason for this last state of<br />\nof<br />\neffect<br />\naffairs, Simone Weil concludes, is that a primary<br />\nthe work experience is to make it extremely difficult to<br />\nwrite, speak or reflect cogently upon it- \"thought cannot<br />\nreach out to grasp the evil which wounds it.\" The result is<br />\nan extraordinarily one-sided view of the work process--a<br />\nliterature dominated by non-workers writing about work.<br />\nThe one-sidedness is not the result of some ideologically<br />\nimposed conspiracy of silence , but a reflection of the<br />\nbarriers which prevent those who know the experience<br />\nfrom articulating its meaning and those capable of<br />\narticulating meaning from grappling with the experience.<br />\nThis condition is itself the product of the separation<br />\nThe limitations and pitfalls inherent in the method are<br />\nbetween mental and manual labor.<br />\nmany and Pfeffer sets most of these out in the<br />\nThe investigation of the work process presents a<br />\nintroduction.

Others are more serious and can never be<br />\nthe<br />\n(including<br />\nqagments of worker literature that exist<br />\novercome--the investigator is there for a term and the<br />\nsongs, the jokes, the political tracts.) Simone Weil, seeing<br />\nworker is a \"lifer\". Pfeffer overcomes most of the<br />\nthe difficulty quite clearly, chose another path. She used<br />\ndifficulties and pushes the method to its limits to exptract<br />\nh erself as part of an \"outrageous<br />\nthe maximum amount of information.<br />\nexpe nment\"--\"outrageous\" because it involved submitting<br />\nherself to the routine of factory life, experiencing the<br />\nThe third part of IV orking for Capitalism has a<br />\nhopes, fears and frustrations, the indignities and insults,<br />\n<br />\n'THIS BOOK HAS BEEN A<br />\nJOURNEY THAT DOES NOT<br />\nEXIST...<br />\nMERE ONLOOKERS WILL<br />\nNOT ARRIVE.'<br />\n<br />\nBut then the incompleteness is not that surprising. It<br />\ntook Simone Weil several years to work through to what<br />\ninterpretation. Finding the<br />\nwas for her a satisfying<br />\nviolence which the work process under capitalism<br />\ninflicted upon the worker unthinkable and appalled by<br />\nStalinism, Weil's reflections took her towards a religious<br />\ninterpretation. But it took several years for her to do that.<br />\nPfeffer seems embarked on a journey which points in<br />\nanother direction but which will surely be just as long. As<br />\nhe himself puts it in his conclusion: \"I am not ready or<br />\nwilling to reduce what I have learned to a few pithy pages<br />\nand definitions. This book has been a journey to a<br />\ndestination that does not ye t exist. It is a journey to a<br />\ndestination that must be of our own conscious, active and<br />\ncollective creation.\" With that exhortation we are invited<br />\nto join in a process of discovery regarding our own<br />\nsociety. A process which demands our active<br />\nparticipation simply because, as he puts it, \"Mere<br />\nonlookers will not arrive.\" And at the base of that there<br />\nlies a larger question: how to make onlookers even<br />\nunderstand. And it is that question which this book<br />\nconfronts head on in no uncertain terms.<br />\nI end with a postscript because although I have tried to<br />\npresent my understanding of this work in terms which<br />\nare honest to my own standards, I am conscious of the<br />\npolitical context in which I am writing. In terms of the<br />\ntwo intellectual traditions I have defined, I judge this<br />\nwork to be very strong in relation to the first nd<br />\nappropriate and eminently defensible as Marxian critical<br />\nscience. In my judgement, there is , then, no question as<br />\nto quality of achievement. The only relevant question is<br />\nwhether these two intellectual tradition-traditions which<br />\nhave both a long and noble history-can be represented in a<br />\nuniversity which is supposedly dedicated to free<br />\nintellectual enquiry and the open pursuit of<br />\nunderstanding by any means that may be requisite to that<br />\nhigh purpose.

After each evolutionary step,<br />\nthe older portions of the brain still exist and must still be<br />\naccomodated. But a new layer- with new functions has<br />\nbeen. added.\" Those three brain layers are the reptilian<br />\ncomplex, found also in reptiles, the limbic system, which<br />\nman shares with other mammals, and the neocortex,<br />\nwhich is found only in the more advanced mammals. The<br />\nbrain of a human being, then, contains remnants of its<br />\nnonhuman ancestors; in fact, the brain of an embyo,<br />\nthrough the seventh week, resembles those of fish and<br />\namphibians.<br />\n<br />\nWhat distinguishes the mammalian brain from the<br />\nreptilian brain is the limbic system, for it is in the limbic<br />\nsystem, contends Sagan, that the beginnings of altruistic<br />\nbehavior are found: \"Love seems to be an invention of<br />\nthe mammals.\" Successive layers of the limbic system and<br />\nneocortex, added to the reptilian base, quite naturally<br />\nincreased the total mass of the brain, so that the historY<br />\nof evolutionary intelligence is one of successively larger<br />\nbrain size and increasingly more sophisticated brain<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nAlthough early ancestors of homo sapiens, like the<br />\nAustralopithecines, had much larger brains in ratio to<br />\nbody mass than other mammals, they had an almost total<br />\nabsence of a forehead, and their brain masses were<br />\nthe average human adult brain<br />\none-third the size of<br />\ntoday. As our apelike forefathers, such as the<br />\nAustralopithecines, evolved, brain size relative to bodY<br />\nmass increased as well.

Because chimpanzees<br />\nand dolphins are, without a doubt, intelligent mammals<br />\ncapable of communication with humans, Sagan wonders,<br />\nand not facetiously, \"If chimpanzees have consciousness,<br />\nif they are capable of abstractions, do they not have what<br />\nuntil now has been described as`human rights'?

For years he lived in Madrid in close<br />\nrelationship to the poets of his generation (Garcia Lorca,<br />\nAlberti, Guillen,Cernuda...), tcthe, Chilean Pablo Neruda<br />\nand the younger Miguel Hernandez. One of his -worst<br />\nhealth crises kept him in this city[ after the Civil War, and<br />\nbecause of his obviously Republican allegiance his<br />\nnamecould not even be printed during the first years of<br />\nthe Franco regime. In 1949 he was elected a member of<br />\nthe Spanish Royal Academy of Language. Aleixandre has<br />\nbeen the most influential living figure in the development<br />\nof Spanish poetry, having also been read in Latin r,<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nHis work (12 books of poems) is remarkable for its<br />\nsustained quality and for a surprising capacity for<br />\nconstant evolution. Aleixandre's early writing combines<br />\nthe Post-Symbolist tradition withtthe game-like fashion of<br />\nthe early 9's avantgarde, but very soon he turned to a<br />\nstrongly irrational, almost oneric language close to<br />\nSurrealist \"automatic writing.\" The poetry of his middle<br />\nperiod has been characterized as a Neo-Romantic<br />\n\"pantheist mysticism: the vision of the cosmos as a<br />\ncreative exotic impulse that thends to unity through its<br />\nown destruction. During the 50's, Aleixandre humanized<br />\nreality in very simple poems about history, about' human<br />\ntime; about the individual's difficulties in living.<br />\nHis very recent work (for most critics his best by far)<br />\nconstitutes an impressive exploration of time, knowing,<br />\nexperience, and old age in an extremely dense language.<br />\n<br />\nTranslators: Leo Emilfork<br />\nDiane Garvey<br />\n(Romance Languages)<br />\n<br />\nCOBRA<br />\n<br />\nCOBRAS<br />\n<br />\nCobra all eyes,<br />\nbulk lying down,evening (low,cloud),<br />\nbulk among dead leaves,<br />\nsurrounded by hearts that suddenly stopped.<br />\n<br />\nLa cobra toda ojos.<br />\nbulto echado la tarde (baja, nube).<br />\nbulto entre hojas secas,<br />\nrodeada de corazones de subito parados.<br />\nRelojes como pulsos<br />\nen los a rboles quietos son pajaros cuyas gargantas cuelgan,<br />\nbesos amables a la cobra baja<br />\ncuya piel es sedosa o fria o esteril.<br />\n<br />\nClocks like pulsations<br />\nare birds whose throats hang on quiet trees,<br />\nkind hisses to the low cobra<br />\nwhose skin is silky or cold or sterile.<br />\nCobra on glass<br />\ncreaking like a fresh knife that undoes a maiden,<br />\nmorning fruit,<br />\nwhose velvet is still in the air, bord-shaped.<br />\n<br />\nCobra sobre cristal<br />\nchirriante como navaja fesca que deshace a una virgen,<br />\nfruta de la manana<br />\ncuyo terciopelo aun csta por el aire en forma de ave.<br />\n<br />\nLittle girls like ponds,<br />\neyes like hope,<br />\nnaked like leaves<br />\na lascivious cobra passes by looking at its other sky.<br />\n<br />\nNinas como lagunas,<br />\nojos como esperanzas,<br />\ndesnudos CQ1110 hojas<br />\ncobra pasa pasciva mirando a so otro cielo.<br />\nPasa y repasa el mundo,<br />\ncadena de cuerpos o sangres que se tocan<br />\ncuando pa piel (!ntera ha huido como un aguila<br />\nque oculta el so.

One of the<br />\nprimary reasons for the success<br />\nof this year's team is the<br />\nexcellent playing of co-captain<br />\nand senior, Frank Olszewski,<br />\nfullback on the Hopkins defense.<br />\nOlszewski has an ambivalent<br />\nPersonality: introverted,<br />\n<br />\nself-demanding , low key on the<br />\nexterior. He is, nevertheless, an<br />\nable individual during high<br />\npressure games, to take command<br />\nand with his excellent field sense<br />\nlead the team to victory. Coach<br />\nOliver describes \"Funk\" as he is<br />\nreferred to by his teammates, as<br />\n\u201cone of the most dedicated<br />\nplayers I have come into contact<br />\nwith at Hopkins\"<br />\nSuch personal dedication to<br />\nthe game was started at a young<br />\nage and developed throughout<br />\n<br />\nOlszewski's years at school.<br />\nFrank started playing at the age<br />\nof six and while in elementary<br />\nand junior high school began<br />\nplaying on local amateur teams.<br />\nIn high school at Patapsco in<br />\nBaltimore and in college at<br />\nHopkins, Frank has played<br />\nvarsity ball and supplemented his<br />\nlove of the game with<br />\nparticipation in seasonal, indoor<br />\nand semi-pro leagues as well as by<br />\ncoaching summer and junior<br />\nteams in his spart time.

The team's<br />\nnext home contest will take place<br />\non Saturday, October 22 when<br />\nthe team faces Georgetown<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n<br />\nJuly in California, Frank was<br />\nchosen as an alternate for the<br />\nU.S. Olympic soccer team of<br />\n1980, a position for which he was<br />\nselected from many national<br />\nhopefuls.<br />\nWith such an impressive record<br />\nit is hard to imagine such an<br />\nindividual as Frank improving his<br />\nplay anymore but with Frank the<br />\ndrive toward self- perfection and<br />\nimprovem ent is always there. \"I<br />\nam constantly practicing and<br />\ntraining to try and develop my<br />\npassing and ball skills, to play<br />\nmore steady ball and develop a<br />\nconstant, stylized form.\" Funk<br />\nlooks for inspiration from Frank<br />\nBeckenbauer, a West German<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Tennis<br />\nServes Well<br />\nby Doug Johnson<br />\nWhen you are scheduled to<br />\nnmeet a team whose school gives<br />\nits tennis players scholarships and<br />\nan all expense-paid full week's<br />\ntrip to Florida to John<br />\nNewcombe's Tennis Camp in<br />\nDecember, and your school has<br />\nbarely even heard of women's<br />\ntennis you might be a little<br />\nintimidated. Not the Johns<br />\nHopkins Women's Tennis team.<br />\nAlthough neither George<br />\nWashington nor JHU ended with<br />\na real victory Tuesday, because,<br />\nwith the overall score tied at 4-4,<br />\nthe last doubles match was called<br />\non account of darkness (the<br />\nwhole thing started at 3:00 pm<br />\nand still wasn't over at 7:oo),<br />\neth Yanowitz seems justified in<br />\nlaiming a \"moral victory\" for<br />\nlerself and her teammates. Beth,<br />\n*n the number one singles slot,<br />\noverpowered her opponent, Beth<br />\n\"aufmann, in straight sets,<br />\n6-2,6-2. Lisa Gottesfield carried<br />\non a three-hour marathon with<br />\nthe number two player from<br />\nGWU, both displaying very, good<br />\nform, but finally lost 6-4,<br />\n4-6,6-7. Lizz Cianos and Kate<br />\n<br />\nFor the second straight week<br />\nthe Jays had their opponents tied<br />\nat fourteen with only one half to<br />\ngo in the contest, but failed to<br />\nscore any more points. This<br />\nweek's combatant, the Ursinus<br />\nBears, rallied for nine points in<br />\nthe final thirty minutes of the<br />\ngame to take the victory. Frosh<br />\nBear quarterback Craig Walck did<br />\nnost of the damage by galloping<br />\n44 yards to a tally and booting a<br />\n40 yard field goal.<br />\nThere were a few bright spots<br />\nin the Jay line\u2022up on Saturday-.<br />\nDespite the lack of scoring<br />\nPunch, the Jays rolled up an<br />\nastounding total of 300 yards on<br />\nthe ground and.342.through the<br />\nair. Junior runningback Kenny<br />\nBess paced the attack with 170<br />\nYards and senior Jerry Faraino<br />\nscored a touchdown late in the<br />\nsecond quarter to bring the Jays<br />\ninto a tie.<br />\n\"Our running game did look<br />\ngood,\" admits Cox. \"But we are<br />\ngoing to have to throw better if<br />\nwe hope to win.

Brandeis<br />\nThe fall classic has returned to<br />\nexcite and thrill us once more.<br />\nThe National<br />\nLeague Los Angeles<br />\nDodgers, boasting \"power, speed<br />\nand<br />\npitching\" take on their<br />\nAmerica' League counterparts,<br />\nthe New<br />\nYork Yankees. Both<br />\nteams are laden with stars and<br />\nevenly matched. There will tie<br />\nPlenty of action on the field to<br />\nthe fans'<br />\ndelight.<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\noff the field<br />\nevents supercede the games<br />\nt hemselves. The<br />\nYankees are<br />\naccuswof buying the pennant and<br />\nbending the rules to suit their<br />\nneeds. The Owner dislikes the<br />\nmanager, the manager has more<br />\nthan the usual<br />\nproblems relating<br />\nto his<br />\nplayers, and the players<br />\nsquabble among themselves. If<br />\nthis is<br />\nreminiscent of the Oakland<br />\nAthletics of recent fame, read on.<br />\nJim<br />\n'Catfish\" Hunter, Reggie<br />\nJackson, Ken Holtzman, and<br />\nMike Tottez<br />\nall played for the<br />\nOakland franchise. Catfish<br />\n<br />\nHunter, Reggie Jackson, and Don<br />\nGullet were purchased as free<br />\nagents, and much of the controversy swells around them. What is<br />\nof greater importance, however,<br />\nis that outright purchasing of<br />\nballplayers is not new to the<br />\ngame of baseball or other sports<br />\nas well. Babe Ruth was sold to<br />\nthe Yankees by the Red Sox and<br />\nTom Seaver was originally bid<br />\nupon by the major league<br />\nfranchises. It is true that the<br />\nnature of the game has changed<br />\nand it is now the ballplayers<br />\nreaping the benefits of their<br />\ntalents.<br />\nWhich system is better? That is<br />\na subjective matter, but<br />\nirreleveant since the rules have<br />\nbeen established and all the<br />\nowners are free to use them.<br />\nAs for Billy Martin's .problems<br />\nin coping with a team of<br />\nego-maniacs, it is entirely to his<br />\nand the teams credit that they<br />\ncan continue winning while<br />\nbelittling each other and the<br />\n<br />\nowner. High -priced teams, loaded<br />\nwith stars and egos, have been<br />\nassembled before and lost. The<br />\nOakland Athletics are a notable<br />\nexception and it should come as<br />\nno surprise that the heart of that<br />\nteam now plays for the Yankees.<br />\nBall games can only be won on<br />\nthe field and not bought. It took<br />\nsensational play form Mickey<br />\nRivers, Thurman Munson, Ron<br />\nGuidry, and Sparky Lyle, for the<br />\nYankees to capture the pennant.<br />\nThese players were all with the<br />\nteam last year along with Graig<br />\nNettles and Chris Chambliss. A<br />\nchampionship team was here long<br />\nbefore Don Gullet and Reggie<br />\nJackson donned pinstripes.<br />\nFurthermore, it is debatable how<br />\nvaluable the free agents are to the<br />\nteam. It took stellar<br />\nperformances at all positions for<br />\nthe Yankees to repeat as<br />\nchampions and all three free<br />\nagents either performed poorly<br />\nor not at all in the play-offs. As<br />\nso often happens a relatively<br />\n<br />\nall season.<br />\nIt is time to steer attention<br />\naway from overpublicized club<br />\nhouse chatter and back to the<br />\nfield where it belongs. At first<br />\nbase, Steve Garvey epitomizeil<br />\nwhat the Dodgers are about.<br />\nPerformance and sportsmanship<br />\nare his trademark . He is strong<br />\nin all aspects of the game and a<br />\nteam leader. A solid hitter and<br />\nfielder, Chris Chambliss<br />\nexemplifies many of the same<br />\nqualities. He had a poor play-offs<br />\nat bat, but should turn around in<br />\nthe series. The edge goes to the<br />\nDodgers.<br />\nAt second base and shortstop,<br />\nthe Dodgers , again have a slight<br />\nedge. Bill Russell is a sometimes<br />\nerratic fielder but comes up with<br />\nthe big play. Dave Lopes adds a<br />\ndimension of speed to the lineup.<br />\nThe Yanks' Bucky Dent and<br />\nWillie Randolph are better<br />\nfielders, but not as consistent at<br />\nbat.<br />\n<br />\nAt third base, Ron Cey and<br />\nGraig Nettles have almost<br />\nidentical statistics this season<br />\nwith Nettles slightly ahead. Both<br />\nWill be key players for theirteams with the Yanks getting the<br />\nedge on this one.<br />\nOn the mound the Dodgers<br />\nshould get better starting<br />\npitching from Don Sutton and<br />\nTommy John. Ron Guidry will<br />\noffset part of it and the Yanks<br />\nmust hope that someone can<br />\nback him up. In the bullpen<br />\nSparky Lyle should provide the<br />\nbetter support with the Dodge's<br />\nweak only by comparison. Both<br />\nteams have excellent reserve<br />\nstrength but in a short series it is<br />\ndifficult to judge its importance.<br />\nIt should be a close and<br />\ncompetitive series with the<br />\nYankshhaving home field<br />\nadvantage. Based on this and my<br />\nN.J. background ths writer picks<br />\nthe Yanks.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14/ News-Letter, Vol. 82, No. 7<br />\n<br />\nRunning Off at the Mouth<br />\nby Christy Jo Anderson<br />\nInterviews are never easy<br />\nthings to do. The people being<br />\nquestioned must be willing to<br />\ntotally open up and talk about<br />\nthemselves in ways that they<br />\nprobably have never conceived of<br />\nbefore. This inquiry went<br />\namazingly well because this<br />\nwriter already knew Brad Mudge<br />\nand Charles Grice before<br />\ninterviewing them.<br />\nThe advantage of previous<br />\ncontact with Brad and Charles<br />\nmade the initial talking a little<br />\nmore natural and therefore, they<br />\nwere at ease in expressing<br />\nthemselves. The obvious danger.<br />\nof course, is that possible lack of<br />\nimpartiality. For this reason, this<br />\narticle is comprised almost<br />\nentirely of their conversation one<br />\nnight when there just happened<br />\nto be a tape recorder<br />\nremembering their every word.<br />\nThe strength of their feelings<br />\nabout running and how it has<br />\naffected their lives is strong<br />\nenough to stand on its own<br />\nwithout interpretation, or<br />\ninterpolation.<br />\n**************** ***********<br />\n<br />\nBrad Mudge is a senior, English<br />\nmajor, and a transfer student<br />\nfrom St.Lawrence. Charles Grice<br />\nis a freshman from Austin, Texas,<br />\nmajoring in International Studies:<br />\nMudge is classified as a<br />\nbearded,prep with a wardrobe<br />\nfrom L.L. Bean, and lately has<br />\nbeen walking with great<br />\ndifficulty due to a back injury<br />\nincurred during the first home<br />\ncross-country meet against<br />\nSwarthmore. His personality on<br />\nfirst contact might seem to be<br />\nquite \"the unapproachable<br />\nhuman being\" but this \u2022 initH<br />\nimpression quickly changes. In<br />\nreality, Brad is just very aware of<br />\nwho he is and with that, assumes<br />\nno social pretense with anyone<br />\nhe meets.<br />\nCharles Grice is an entirely<br />\ndifferent person. Six-foot four,<br />\nblond, and with legs so long that<br />\none can only laugh about the<br />\ntrouble he must have finding<br />\njeans that fit, he is more reserved<br />\nthan Brad but still slightly crazy<br />\nnonetheless.<br />\nBrad: I can identify with you so<br />\nmuch, Charles. When you choked<br />\nthat first race (Loyola). I knew<br />\nyou were going to, everybody<br />\ndoes. When I was a freshman, I<br />\nburned out every practice, then<br />\nI'd get out there at the race, burn<br />\nthe first mile and tie up so badly<br />\nafter that that I couldn't move I<br />\nwas so tight.<br />\nCharles:I've been doing that all<br />\nalong. I burn myself out every<br />\npractice.<br />\nBrad:But you're a much better<br />\nrunner than I ever was. I didn't<br />\nstart running till senior year in<br />\nhigh school; I was a football jock.<br />\nI weighed 160 pounds and played<br />\ncenter and middle linebacker. I<br />\nwas a lot bigger, I'm about 130<br />\nnow. I was heavier and smoked<br />\ncigarettes and was drinking. I<br />\nused to be really a wreck.<br />\n<br />\nAll three of those present,<br />\nincluding the interviewer, are<br />\nvegetarians, and talking about<br />\nthat change in Brad's lifestyle<br />\nbrought up the subject of a<br />\nmeat-less diets.<br />\nCharles: My vegetarianism has<br />\ngrown since when I first started.<br />\nThe humanitarian aspect is not<br />\nvery important at all any more.<br />\nBrad:Let 'em all bleed. For me, I<br />\nstarted when I was an ecology<br />\nfreak, so to speak, as an<br />\necological consideration. Eating<br />\nmeat is just incredibly wasteful.<br />\nCharles:but now we're away<br />\nfrom that and back to khaki<br />\npants. And now my<br />\nvegetarianism is more selfish and<br />\nself\u2014centered and to hell with<br />\nthat stuff.<br />\nBrad: And you have to be<br />\nself-centered. Charles:And it's<br />\nall developed. As you progress<br />\nyou take notice of that<br />\nprogression.<br />\n<br />\nthought \"My god, I'm going to<br />\nout so long for,\" and I was<br />\nrunning right away. My healing<br />\nprocesses are strange. I'd like to<br />\nget back for the championship<br />\nand nationals because I think I<br />\ncould be of some help.<br />\nCharles:Yeah, we really need<br />\nyou. That's one thing though. I<br />\ndo have four more years ahead of<br />\nme, which I have to remember.<br />\nBrad:It's a period of incredible<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\nCharles:Staying here? I'd prefer<br />\nnot to think about it. I doubt it.<br />\nBrad ;That's what everybody says.<br />\n<br />\ncompete; to win sometimes and<br />\nthat's incredible incentive. Who<br />\nwants to go to Oregon and be 35<br />\nman? That's got to be the pits.<br />\nBut even in our team there's a lot<br />\nof tension.<br />\nCharles; And it's getting worse.<br />\nBrad:But the running itself is a<br />\ntension released. I run more<br />\nduring exam time than any other<br />\ntime all year round, simply so I<br />\ndon't have to study.<br />\nCharles: And you run well then,<br />\ntoo.<br />\nBrad: You're damn right I do.<br />\nCharles:You got all this energy.<br />\nYou study like hell, run like hell<br />\nand then run like hell some<br />\nmore.Brad:It's amazing.

And I<br />\nhad never paid much attention to Woody Allen, so after I<br />\ntook on this job, I went and saw one of his movies.<br />\nCCS: Which one did you see?<br />\nMMc: I think it's the Sleeper, which was rather dull. But<br />\nthen I began to read a couple of his books (Without<br />\nFeathers, I think, was the first one), which I found quite<br />\ndelightful. Then I got to New York and found myself in<br />\nthat movie queue at 7:30 a.m. (laughter) on a cold<br />\nNovember morning (laughter). But Woody was sitting<br />\nnearby in a long trailer full of...where he kept all the<br />\ncostumes for the show, and so we talked there and had<br />\ncoffee. But it seemed very strange to see this crowd of<br />\npeople standing outside a movie at 7 a.m. I think it was<br />\nThe Ekide of Frankenstein.

A paper on some aspect of the legislative<br />\nof the second semester, is also<br />\nProcess,<br />\nrequired.due at the end<br />\n_ loth the state and local internships begin in January<br />\n_awith an orienta tion program designed to introduce<br />\nbt udents to the nuts and bolts aspects of the legislative<br />\n'<br />\n134Y for which they will work. Differeat legislators speak<br />\n,<br />\nu such basics as committee structure, how a bill is<br />\n(itt<br />\ntkrafted and becomes law, and the relationship between<br />\n\"e legislative and executive branches.<br />\nv:rite Intersession period is considered an important and<br />\nan-table part of the program. Working full time, and freed<br /><br />\nfrom the time constraints present during the normal<br />\nsemester, students develop a solid understanding of the<br />\nrole of their sponsor and of the legislature as a whole.<br />\nThey are able to develop a personal relationship with their<br />\nsponsor and become fully acclimated with their<br />\nsurroundings. The experiences and knowledge obtained<br />\nduring this period ease the transition to a part-time status<br />\nthat occurs in the second semester. By this time, students<br />\nhave a better understanding of their own interests and<br />\nlimitation, and can concentrate on a particular activity or<br />\narea, if they so desire.<br />\nBeginning second semester, student are assigned<br />\nreadings on state and local government that are designed<br />\nto compliment thie work experiences. The reading load is<br />\nnot heavy, and varies from tradition political theory to<br />\nanalyses of current political situations. The readings<br />\nexplore such issues as the urban political machine, the<br />\nrole of community groups, and legis lative reform.<br />\nStudents bring together both the theoretical and the<br />\npractical through discussion of the readings in relation to<br />\ntheir own observations of the operation of the political<br />\nsystem.<br />\nThe range of work experience may differ with each<br />\nintern. Depending on the sponsor and the legislature<br />\n(state or city or county council), the interns perform a<br />\nvariety of functions. These include issue research,<br />\nconstituent relations, speech writing, bill drafting,<br />\ncontact with bureaucratic agencies, or representing their<br />\nsponsor at a community or even a committee meeting.<br />\nXeroxing and envelope stuffing seem to be an inescapable<br />\npart of an intern's life, but is by no means his only<br />\nfunction. State and especially local legislators are often so<br />\nshort on staff- that they can ill afford to waste the<br />\nvaluable resource offered in an intern. The sponsors are<br />\naware of what the intern can do, and are not hesitant to<br />\nutilize him or her.<br />\nAccording to Bob Roach, graduate student<br />\nco-ordinator of the program, \"The legislators are<br />\ninformed that the students are expected to work as<br />\nlegislative or administrative assistants. If we find that a<br /><br />\nRichard Pfeffer was denied tenure by the Political<br />\nScience Department last year. He was refused an ad<br />\nhoc committee by the Academic Council this fall.<br />\nMuch has been made of Pfeffer's Marxism--both as a<br />\ncause of why he was rejected and as a reason why he<br />\nshould be retained at this politically conservative<br />\nand academically orthodox university.<br />\nBut the campaign which Pfeffer and his advocates<br />\nhave been waging is a classic case of the Good Old<br />\nCause of liberalism. If Pfeffer were to remain true<br />\nto his Marxist activism, he would have washed his<br />\nhands of this place long ago and kept his job as a<br />\nforklift operator. That, however, is a dilemma of<br />\nradical intellectuals which they rarely happily can<br />\nresolve for themselves. So, wishing to remain within<br />\nthe Ivory Tower, Pfeffer has taken on the liberal<br />\ncoloring of the context in which he is operating.<br />\nBasically, his case comes down to the right of an<br />\nindividualto free expression-however idiosyncratic<br />\nand unorthodox--and to fair review in an essentially<br />\njudicial proceeding. Neither of these rights is given<br />\nvery high priority in Marxist political systems, nor is<br />\nthe individual, per se. The question here is what<br />\npriority are they to be given at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity? Sadly thus far, the answer seems also to<br />\nbe: quite low.<br />\nThe esteemed academic reputation of Johns<br />\nHopkins apparently cannot afford one<br />\nunconventional scholar. The academicians here<br />\napparently cannot tolerate in their midst the<br />\npresence of an aggressive teacher. And the Academic<br />\nCouncil cannot violate the principle of departmental<br />\nautonomy on behalf of a mere individual. That is<br />\nthe final irony of this good old liberal cause: an<br />\nostensibly liberal safeguard of the principle of<br />\nautonomy has protected the integrity of individual<br />\ndepartments and even individuals within<br />\ndepartments against the power of the larger<br />\nuniversity. Now those securely entrenched in power<br />\nhere are using this principle as a shield against one<br />\nindividual's challenge to the integrity of this<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nCan Johns Hopkins meet the challenge? Is this<br />\nuniversity going to yield to<br />\ninternal group pressure and conformity, or is it<br />\ngoing to grant Richard Pfeffer the right to a fair<br />\nCont'd. P. 17.<br /><br />\nstudent is not being used in a productive manner the<br />\nsponsor is contacted and an attempt is made to correct his<br />\nor her approach. If necessary, the student would be<br />\nplaced in another office.\" However, throughout the six or<br />\nseven year life span of the program, this latter course of<br />\naction has rarely been necessary. Many of the sponsors<br />\nhave been accepting interns since the conception of the<br />\nprogram, and have developed an appreciation for the<br />\nvalue of the student's contribution. In a few cases,<br />\nstudents develop such a good relationship with the<br />\nlegislator that they will continue contact even after the<br />\ninternship has formally ended-as a volunteer in a political<br />\ncampaign, for example.<br />\nRoach pointed out that the program has built up a<br />\ngood reputation among the state and local legislators, and<br />\n!have more requests: for interns than it can handle. The<br />\nprogram has expanded and now places students with the<br />\nBaltimore County Council, in addition to the City<br />\nCouncil. This year an experimental phase will place some<br />\nstudents with the General Assembly's Legislative Study<br />\nGroup. The primary emphasis will be on issues research,<br />\nbut the students will also be available for spot duty to a<br />\nparticular delegate.<br />\nHopkins generally places 10-12 of its own students per<br />\nyear in the program, but students from UMBC, Towson<br />\nState, and Goucher may also apply bringing the total<br />\nnumber of students involved to an average of 35- 40 per<br />\nHopkins<br />\nyear. The seminars, however, are limited to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nFinally, and probably most important of all, a Hopkins<br />\nstudent can gain more from a political internship than just<br />\nthe increased knowledge of state and local government.<br />\nThe interns are active participants whose ideas and efforts<br />\ncan add to the final product.<br />\nApplications for the Curriculum for Political<br />\nLeadership are available in the Polifical Science<br />\ndepartment office and Room C-2 of the Metro Center<br />\n(basement of Shriver).

Considine<br />\nThe Peabody-Hopkins concert series got off 'to a<br />\nroraring start when pianists Enrique Graf and Katherine<br />\nJacobson performed a duo-piano recital in Shriver Hall<br />\nOctober 1.<br />\nDuo-piano recitals are far from commonplace<br />\noccurances these days, and one suspects this is due as<br />\nmuch from the somewhat limited repertoire as it is from<br />\nthe logistics problem of getting two matched concert<br />\ngrands on the stage at the same time. Surely, there is<br />\nliterature available for one piano, four hands, but it would<br />\nbe foolish to restrict a concert bill to strictly those pieces.<br />\nIs it any wonder, then, that there are but few great<br />\npiano duos in the world today? Alfons and Aloys<br />\nKontarsky, Eden and Tamir, and Walter and Beatriz Klein<br />\nare a few of the great duos, and to those pairs we should<br />\nadd yet another; Graf and Jacobson.<br />\nMr. Graf and Ms. Jacobson are both master students of<br />\nLeon Fleisher, the famed pianist who teacher at the<br />\nPeabody. Their ensemble performances date back to a<br />\nFaculty recital in 1976 (both were on the faculty of the<br />\nPreparatory Department).That performance was so<br />\nsuccessful that the duo was sponsored by the Peabody in<br />\nthe National Piano Ensemble Competition this year,<br />\nwhich they won by unanimous decision of the judges.<br />\nHaving heard them play, one is not surprised. The two<br />\npianists do not play exactly alike; rather, like the<br />\ndifferent sections of an orchestra, they maintain certain<br />\ndistinct timbraltraits, which greatly enhance the sound of<br />\nthe duo. One hears a sense of depth and shading that<br />\nexemplifies the best in pianistic technique, but, because<br />\nof the use of two pianists, the colorisms are expanded on<br />\na grand scale.<br />\nIn this respect, one wishes that the two pianos used in<br />\nthe concert had been better matched. The primary piano<br />\nwas the magnificent German Steinway used by the Shriver<br />\nHall Concert Series. Regrettably, the secondary piano,<br /><br />\nwhich was not a bad piano in itself, was so outclassed by<br />\nthe magnificence of sound and clarity of tone generated<br />\nby its German brother, that the two instruments seemed<br />\nalmost like the prince and the pauper. This problem was<br />\navoided at first, as the opening piece in the concert was the<br />\nMozart Sonata in C Major. (K.521) for four hands. With<br />\nMs. Jacobson carrying the bass while Mr. Graf effortlessly<br />\ndelivered the treble, it was a performance of unmistakable<br />\ngrace and sheer Mozartean clarity. One felt that, with an<br />\nopening of such infinite delight, the duo would be<br />\nhard-pressed for a rejoinder.<br />\nHard-pressed, perhaps, but successful nevertheless,<br />\nfor following the Mozart was a stunning reading of<br />\nBeethoven's Sonata 8 in c minor (op. 13), \"Pathetique,\"<br />\nby Mr. Graf.<br />\nAn extreme, yirtuosic sense of dynamics, an insightful<br />\nsense of phrase and robust sense of Romanticism<br />\ncharacterized Mr. Graf's performance. Tossing off phrase<br />\nafter phrase with almost frightening abandon, Mr. Graf<br />\ngave the impression that even the most difficult passages<br />\nwere mere child's play for him.<br />\nIn fact, perhaps the only criticism one might have was<br />\nthat Mr. Graf's playing seemed almost athletic in its sense<br />\nof technical prowess. The piano was often pushed to its<br />\nlimits, its rich sonority verging on clangor.<br />\nBut one need only recall that Beethoven was well<br />\nknown for his pianistic excesses, and his inability to find<br />\nin those puny Viennese pianos a suitable outlet for his<br />\npowerful technique. With this in mind, one seemed to get<br />\nan idea of what the Pathetique sounded like for<br />\nBeethoven, its edges rough and sonorities surging, as Mr.<br />\nGraf eschewed the almost overly polite playing of many<br />\nconcert pianists.<br />\nFollowing the Beethoven was the Brahms Variations on<br />\na Theme be Haydn (op. 56), for two pianos. The work<br />\nseems to be a Peabody favorite, as the Peabody orchestra<br />\nhad performed it a mere four days before. Although the<br />\norchestral version is by far the more popular, one finds<br />\nthat the piano score is ,not, only an easier means of<br />\nfollowing the piece's exposition, and, because of its<br /><br />\nlighter tone, generally more pleasing. The performance<br />\neasily did justice to both composer and composition.<br />\nAlexander Scriabin was a Russian prodigy, whose piano<br />\nand orchestral music infused a strong sense of mysticism<br />\ninto a Spartan, if somewhat spatial, romantic esthetic. His<br />\nSonata in f minor (op. 23), which was performed by Ms.<br />\nJacobson, is a technically intriguing work, somehow<br />\nreminiscent of later Liszt, yet not entirely rewarding to<br />\nthe listener.<br />\nThus, it was ample tribute to Ms. Jacobson that she<br />\nmaintained a cogent sense of lyricism that kept the<br />\nlistener's interest while remaining true to the ephemeral<br />\nspirit of the work. In short, a convincing performance of a<br />\nless-than- convincing work.<br />\nFinally, the audience was treated to Ravel's La Valse. A<br />\ntruly orchestral duet, it is better known to most audiences<br />\nin its later orchestral version. Despite the general fondness<br />\nof American audiences for orchestral Ravel, one can easily<br />\ncome to believe that it is through the piano works that he<br />\nis truly to be known<br />\nThe Graf-Jacobson Ravel was truly a knowing<br />\nperformance in that respect, despite having been marred<br />\nby the unequal balance between the two instruments.<br />\nPreviously, Mr. Graf's powerful, crisp playing had<br />\npreviously graced only the German Steinway, while Ms.<br />\nJacobson,performed the Brahms on its American cousin.<br />\nThe difference was not as noticable then, because Ms.<br />\nJacobson's playing was more fluid, less intense than that<br />\nof Mr. Graf, and thus did not tax the American piano.<br />\nBoth piano parts in the Ravel demand the utmost from<br />\ntheir pianos, and thus some of Mr. Graf's rippling glissandi<br />\ndemanded more than his poor keyboard could deliver. In<br />\nRavel, the clarity is of tantamount performance,so such a<br />\nfailure was unfortunately irritating.<br />\nOurtisde of such technical trivialities, though, the<br />\nperformance of the Ravel was admirably authoritative,<br />\nand delightfully crisp. If this concert is indicative of what<br />\nthe Peabody has to give Hopkins, certainly many will be<br />\neagerly awaiting the next offering.<br /><br />\n11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111<br /><br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1\u2022<br />\nI1I 1 \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI 1I<br />\n\u2022I1\u2022<br />\n1\u20220<br />\nIII01110<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI1<br /><br />\n\u2022\u202211 0\u2022I.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.10\u2022011<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n11 11<br />\nIII II\u2022<br />\nII<br /><br />\n=I\u20221<br />\n=TP<br /><br />\nFreshmen Class Elections/Run-offs<br />\nReferendum on the formation of an ad hoc<br />\nabout referedum available<br />\ncommittee for Dr. Pfeffer (Info<br />\nat Student Council office)<br />\nBallot boxes will be located at:<br />\nDorm Snack Bar/Cafeteria 10a.m. - 7p.m.<br /><br />\nGilman 10a.m. - 2p.m.<br /><br />\n.<br />\n00<br />\n0.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n000<br />\n.0.<br /><br />\n0.<br />\n00.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n..o\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022...<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2014<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nLevering Cafeteria 9a.m. - 2p.m.<br /><br />\nLibrary 7p.m. - 11p.m.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nw\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n0101.<br />\n011=<br />\n011110\u20221.11<br />\n....<br />\n1=1000,1b<br />\nMOM/0<br />\n01.=<br />\n1/=.\u2022<br /><br />\nResults of the Freshmen Elections<br />\nCandidates in Run-off<br /><br />\n=Mb<br />\n'<br />\n0:1\u2022<br />\n\"=.<br />\n00<br /><br />\n10.111<br /><br />\nPresident<br /><br />\n\u2022=0<br /><br />\n=1<br /><br />\n==<br /><br />\nRobert Seder<br />\nMichael Steele<br /><br />\nS.C.

I will pay<br />\nparticular attention to its intellectual roots since these are<br />\nnot readily apparent, perhaps unfamiliar and therefore,<br />\nopen to misinterpretation. I shall argue that Pfeffer's<br />\nwork should be located and judged with respect to two<br />\nintellectual traditions which, although important in their<br />\nown right, are quite alien to positive social science as it is<br />\nusually practised in American universities. The first of<br />\nthese traditions relates quite simply to a humanistic<br />\nconcern with the dignity of work and can claim writers<br />\nlike Rousseau, Fourier, Tolstoy, Proudhon and others. I<br />\nshall make particular reference to Simone Well since<br />\ncertain parallels exist between Pfeffer's work and hers.<br />\nThe second tradition is that of Marx with its emphasis<br />\nUpon the construction of a critical science.<br />\nThe problem which Pfeffer addresses is the work<br />\nprocess and its meaning in capitalist society. There is ,of<br />\ncourse, an abundant literature on this and even whole<br />\nsub -discipline swhich seek to deal with certain aspects of<br />\nit. What distinguishes Pfeffer's book is not the problem<br />\naddressed but the manner of his approach and the method<br />\non inquiry. Since these last seem, at first sight, rather<br /><br />\nthe camaraderie and hostility, at the same time as she multiplicity of objectives. The first is to show that the<br />\nsought to grapple with \"the evil which wound thought information which Pfeffer has obtained is consistent with<br />\nitself.\" She went to work in the Renault factory in that of other investigators who have examined work for<br />\n1934-5. She left feeling that she was marked for ever with different perspectives using different methods--the direct<br />\nthe brand of slavery, understanding at last how the Stoical interviews of Terkel and Sennett and Cobb, the<br />\nacceptance of the indignity of work was the only possible participant working of Balzer and the more traditional<br />\nsocial science studies as represented by the HEW report<br />\noutcome of submission to the \"invincible and inexorable<br />\non Work in America. The second objective is to critique<br />\n(which<br />\njournal<br />\nfactory<br />\nHer<br />\nlife.<br />\nfactory<br />\noppression\" of<br />\nthe<br />\ninterpretations of others, to contrast the \"liberal\" and<br />\nHannah Arendt praised as \"the most unsentimental<br />\n\"Marxian\"<br />\ninterpretations, to show the inherent weakness<br />\naccount of factory life\" she had ever read) was a turning<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nwhen exposed to the critical tools of the<br />\nformer<br />\nhuman<br />\nthe<br />\non<br />\npoint with regard to her reflections<br />\nlatter and thereby to consolidate the Marxian<br />\ncondition.<br />\ninterpretation. A third objective is to provide a reflective<br />\nPfeffer, in the first two parts of Working for Capitalism<br />\ninterpretation of the work experience using the Marxian<br />\ngives an account of precisely such an \"outrageous<br />\ntools.<br />\ncondensation<br />\norganized<br />\nan<br />\nexperiment.\" The account is<br />\nI judge this part to be less successful than the first two<br />\nof an extensive journal kept day by day while working in<br />\nan industrial plant in South Baltimore. The prose is clear partly because the objectives sometimes get in the way of<br />\nand cogent, free of any sentimentality or pedantry. The each other and partly because of the method of<br />\naccount is lucid and Pfeffer strips away, step by step, the presentation. The material assembled as supportive<br />\nfog that shrouds the mysteries of the work experience-- evidence is strong enough and the Marxian critique of<br />\nthe socialization that takes place in even looking for a job, liberal interpretations comes through superbly at times<br />\nthe training process, the technical aspects of work, the although the quality is here uneven. The reflective<br />\nsocial relationshipswithin the job hierarchy, the concerns interpretation of the work experience is lessstrong and it is<br />\nof workers and the institutional arrangements through in this regard that I judge the work still to be incomplete.<br />\nwhich those concerns are supposed to be expressed. All of The links between the first two parts and the third need<br />\nthese topics are subjected to detailed scrutiny. But the strengthening. The bond between these separate<br />\naccount is much more than that,for this is no work components is crucial to the final interpreatation.<br />\n\u2022 :,9v:4ffi<br /><br />\ns<br />\n4.y<br /><br />\nKt:V<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nconstructed in the mould of a supposedly objective,<br />\npeculiar, it is important to explain the rationale that lies<br />\nsocial science.Nor is this simply participant<br />\n\"value-free\"<br />\nbehind them.<br />\nobservation. By its very nature, this kind of experiment<br />\nThe universal thread which connects the literature on<br />\nuses the self as an integral element within it. The feelings<br />\nWork in capitalist society is a notion of the gap between<br />\nthe manager and the managed, between the \"bosses\" and<br />\nand thoughts, the careful charting of emotional and<br />\nsubjective responses, the conflicting tensions, all become<br />\nthe \"workers\", between \"us\" and \"them\". This gap gets<br />\nin<br />\ni nternalized within the literature on the problem of embroiled in the experiment.

A great deal of literature, for example, deals<br />\nexperiment lose their clear separate identity and become<br />\ndirectly with how \"we\" can make \"them\" happier, less<br />\nlocked in a dialectical unity. The struggle then becomes to<br />\nalienated, more cooperative and more productive. Those<br />\nfind a representation of it all which is itself a synthesis of<br />\nwho seek to understand the work process from the inside<br />\nmaterial experience and human response. This Pfeffer<br />\ninevitably end up imposing mental constructs which sit<br />\ndoes admirably. And at the end of the day we are left<br />\nu ncomfortably with the phenomena being described. And<br />\nwith a unique and indelible impression of what working<br />\nthe workers themselves often seem incapable of<br />\nfor capitalism is like, as experienced on the front line.<br />\narticulating their feelings. The reason for this last state of<br />\nof<br />\neffect<br />\naffairs, Simone Weil concludes, is that a primary<br />\nthe work experience is to make it extremely difficult to<br />\nwrite, speak or reflect cogently upon it- \"thought cannot<br />\nreach out to grasp the evil which wounds it.\" The result is<br />\nan extraordinarily one-sided view of the work process--a<br />\nliterature dominated by non-workers writing about work.<br />\nThe one-sidedness is not the result of some ideologically<br />\nimposed conspiracy of silence , but a reflection of the<br />\nbarriers which prevent those who know the experience<br />\nfrom articulating its meaning and those capable of<br />\narticulating meaning from grappling with the experience.<br />\nThis condition is itself the product of the separation<br />\nThe limitations and pitfalls inherent in the method are<br />\nbetween mental and manual labor.<br />\nmany and Pfeffer sets most of these out in the<br />\nThe investigation of the work process presents a<br />\nintroduction.

Others are more serious and can never be<br />\nthe<br />\n(including<br />\nqagments of worker literature that exist<br />\novercome--the investigator is there for a term and the<br />\nsongs, the jokes, the political tracts.) Simone Weil, seeing<br />\nworker is a \"lifer\". Pfeffer overcomes most of the<br />\nthe difficulty quite clearly, chose another path. She used<br />\ndifficulties and pushes the method to its limits to exptract<br />\nh erself as part of an \"outrageous<br />\nthe maximum amount of information.<br />\nexpe nment\"--\"outrageous\" because it involved submitting<br />\nherself to the routine of factory life, experiencing the<br />\nThe third part of IV orking for Capitalism has a<br />\nhopes, fears and frustrations, the indignities and insults,<br /><br />\n'THIS BOOK HAS BEEN A<br />\nJOURNEY THAT DOES NOT<br />\nEXIST...<br />\nMERE ONLOOKERS WILL<br />\nNOT ARRIVE.'<br /><br />\nBut then the incompleteness is not that surprising. It<br />\ntook Simone Weil several years to work through to what<br />\ninterpretation. Finding the<br />\nwas for her a satisfying<br />\nviolence which the work process under capitalism<br />\ninflicted upon the worker unthinkable and appalled by<br />\nStalinism, Weil's reflections took her towards a religious<br />\ninterpretation. But it took several years for her to do that.<br />\nPfeffer seems embarked on a journey which points in<br />\nanother direction but which will surely be just as long. As<br />\nhe himself puts it in his conclusion: \"I am not ready or<br />\nwilling to reduce what I have learned to a few pithy pages<br />\nand definitions. This book has been a journey to a<br />\ndestination that does not ye t exist. It is a journey to a<br />\ndestination that must be of our own conscious, active and<br />\ncollective creation.\" With that exhortation we are invited<br />\nto join in a process of discovery regarding our own<br />\nsociety. A process which demands our active<br />\nparticipation simply because, as he puts it, \"Mere<br />\nonlookers will not arrive.\" And at the base of that there<br />\nlies a larger question: how to make onlookers even<br />\nunderstand. And it is that question which this book<br />\nconfronts head on in no uncertain terms.<br />\nI end with a postscript because although I have tried to<br />\npresent my understanding of this work in terms which<br />\nare honest to my own standards, I am conscious of the<br />\npolitical context in which I am writing. In terms of the<br />\ntwo intellectual traditions I have defined, I judge this<br />\nwork to be very strong in relation to the first nd<br />\nappropriate and eminently defensible as Marxian critical<br />\nscience. In my judgement, there is , then, no question as<br />\nto quality of achievement. The only relevant question is<br />\nwhether these two intellectual tradition-traditions which<br />\nhave both a long and noble history-can be represented in a<br />\nuniversity which is supposedly dedicated to free<br />\nintellectual enquiry and the open pursuit of<br />\nunderstanding by any means that may be requisite to that<br />\nhigh purpose.

But a new layer- with new functions has<br />\nbeen. added.\" Those three brain layers are the reptilian<br />\ncomplex, found also in reptiles, the limbic system, which<br />\nman shares with other mammals, and the neocortex,<br />\nwhich is found only in the more advanced mammals. The<br />\nbrain of a human being, then, contains remnants of its<br />\nnonhuman ancestors; in fact, the brain of an embyo,<br />\nthrough the seventh week, resembles those of fish and<br />\namphibians.<br /><br />\nWhat distinguishes the mammalian brain from the<br />\nreptilian brain is the limbic system, for it is in the limbic<br />\nsystem, contends Sagan, that the beginnings of altruistic<br />\nbehavior are found: \"Love seems to be an invention of<br />\nthe mammals.\" Successive layers of the limbic system and<br />\nneocortex, added to the reptilian base, quite naturally<br />\nincreased the total mass of the brain, so that the historY<br />\nof evolutionary intelligence is one of successively larger<br />\nbrain size and increasingly more sophisticated brain<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nAlthough early ancestors of homo sapiens, like the<br />\nAustralopithecines, had much larger brains in ratio to<br />\nbody mass than other mammals, they had an almost total<br />\nabsence of a forehead, and their brain masses were<br />\nthe average human adult brain<br />\none-third the size of<br />\ntoday. As our apelike forefathers, such as the<br />\nAustralopithecines, evolved, brain size relative to bodY<br />\nmass increased as well.

Because chimpanzees<br />\nand dolphins are, without a doubt, intelligent mammals<br />\ncapable of communication with humans, Sagan wonders,<br />\nand not facetiously, \"If chimpanzees have consciousness,<br />\nif they are capable of abstractions, do they not have what<br />\nuntil now has been described as`human rights'?

For years he lived in Madrid in close<br />\nrelationship to the poets of his generation (Garcia Lorca,<br />\nAlberti, Guillen,Cernuda...), tcthe, Chilean Pablo Neruda<br />\nand the younger Miguel Hernandez. One of his -worst<br />\nhealth crises kept him in this city[ after the Civil War, and<br />\nbecause of his obviously Republican allegiance his<br />\nnamecould not even be printed during the first years of<br />\nthe Franco regime. In 1949 he was elected a member of<br />\nthe Spanish Royal Academy of Language. Aleixandre has<br />\nbeen the most influential living figure in the development<br />\nof Spanish poetry, having also been read in Latin r,<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nHis work (12 books of poems) is remarkable for its<br />\nsustained quality and for a surprising capacity for<br />\nconstant evolution. Aleixandre's early writing combines<br />\nthe Post-Symbolist tradition withtthe game-like fashion of<br />\nthe early 9's avantgarde, but very soon he turned to a<br />\nstrongly irrational, almost oneric language close to<br />\nSurrealist \"automatic writing.\" The poetry of his middle<br />\nperiod has been characterized as a Neo-Romantic<br />\n\"pantheist mysticism: the vision of the cosmos as a<br />\ncreative exotic impulse that thends to unity through its<br />\nown destruction. During the 50's, Aleixandre humanized<br />\nreality in very simple poems about history, about' human<br />\ntime; about the individual's difficulties in living.<br />\nHis very recent work (for most critics his best by far)<br />\nconstitutes an impressive exploration of time, knowing,<br />\nexperience, and old age in an extremely dense language.<br /><br />\nTranslators: Leo Emilfork<br />\nDiane Garvey<br />\n(Romance Languages)<br /><br />\nCOBRA<br /><br />\nCOBRAS<br /><br />\nCobra all eyes,<br />\nbulk lying down,evening (low,cloud),<br />\nbulk among dead leaves,<br />\nsurrounded by hearts that suddenly stopped.<br /><br />\nLa cobra toda ojos.<br />\nbulto echado la tarde (baja, nube).<br />\nbulto entre hojas secas,<br />\nrodeada de corazones de subito parados.<br />\nRelojes como pulsos<br />\nen los a rboles quietos son pajaros cuyas gargantas cuelgan,<br />\nbesos amables a la cobra baja<br />\ncuya piel es sedosa o fria o esteril.<br /><br />\nClocks like pulsations<br />\nare birds whose throats hang on quiet trees,<br />\nkind hisses to the low cobra<br />\nwhose skin is silky or cold or sterile.<br />\nCobra on glass<br />\ncreaking like a fresh knife that undoes a maiden,<br />\nmorning fruit,<br />\nwhose velvet is still in the air, bord-shaped.<br /><br />\nCobra sobre cristal<br />\nchirriante como navaja fesca que deshace a una virgen,<br />\nfruta de la manana<br />\ncuyo terciopelo aun csta por el aire en forma de ave.<br /><br />\nLittle girls like ponds,<br />\neyes like hope,<br />\nnaked like leaves<br />\na lascivious cobra passes by looking at its other sky.<br /><br />\nNinas como lagunas,<br />\nojos como esperanzas,<br />\ndesnudos CQ1110 hojas<br />\ncobra pasa pasciva mirando a so otro cielo.<br />\nPasa y repasa el mundo,<br />\ncadena de cuerpos o sangres que se tocan<br />\ncuando pa piel (!ntera ha huido como un aguila<br />\nque oculta el so.

One of the<br />\nprimary reasons for the success<br />\nof this year's team is the<br />\nexcellent playing of co-captain<br />\nand senior, Frank Olszewski,<br />\nfullback on the Hopkins defense.<br />\nOlszewski has an ambivalent<br />\nPersonality: introverted,<br /><br />\nself-demanding , low key on the<br />\nexterior. He is, nevertheless, an<br />\nable individual during high<br />\npressure games, to take command<br />\nand with his excellent field sense<br />\nlead the team to victory. Coach<br />\nOliver describes \"Funk\" as he is<br />\nreferred to by his teammates, as<br />\n\u201cone of the most dedicated<br />\nplayers I have come into contact<br />\nwith at Hopkins\"<br />\nSuch personal dedication to<br />\nthe game was started at a young<br />\nage and developed throughout<br /><br />\nOlszewski's years at school.<br />\nFrank started playing at the age<br />\nof six and while in elementary<br />\nand junior high school began<br />\nplaying on local amateur teams.<br />\nIn high school at Patapsco in<br />\nBaltimore and in college at<br />\nHopkins, Frank has played<br />\nvarsity ball and supplemented his<br />\nlove of the game with<br />\nparticipation in seasonal, indoor<br />\nand semi-pro leagues as well as by<br />\ncoaching summer and junior<br />\nteams in his spart time.

Brandeis<br />\nThe fall classic has returned to<br />\nexcite and thrill us once more.<br />\nThe National<br />\nLeague Los Angeles<br />\nDodgers, boasting \"power, speed<br />\nand<br />\npitching\" take on their<br />\nAmerica' League counterparts,<br />\nthe New<br />\nYork Yankees. Both<br />\nteams are laden with stars and<br />\nevenly matched. There will tie<br />\nPlenty of action on the field to<br />\nthe fans'<br />\ndelight.<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\noff the field<br />\nevents supercede the games<br />\nt hemselves. The<br />\nYankees are<br />\naccuswof buying the pennant and<br />\nbending the rules to suit their<br />\nneeds. The Owner dislikes the<br />\nmanager, the manager has more<br />\nthan the usual<br />\nproblems relating<br />\nto his<br />\nplayers, and the players<br />\nsquabble among themselves. If<br />\nthis is<br />\nreminiscent of the Oakland<br />\nAthletics of recent fame, read on.<br />\nJim<br />\n'Catfish\" Hunter, Reggie<br />\nJackson, Ken Holtzman, and<br />\nMike Tottez<br />\nall played for the<br />\nOakland franchise. Catfish<br /><br />\nHunter, Reggie Jackson, and Don<br />\nGullet were purchased as free<br />\nagents, and much of the controversy swells around them. What is<br />\nof greater importance, however,<br />\nis that outright purchasing of<br />\nballplayers is not new to the<br />\ngame of baseball or other sports<br />\nas well. Babe Ruth was sold to<br />\nthe Yankees by the Red Sox and<br />\nTom Seaver was originally bid<br />\nupon by the major league<br />\nfranchises. It is true that the<br />\nnature of the game has changed<br />\nand it is now the ballplayers<br />\nreaping the benefits of their<br />\ntalents.<br />\nWhich system is better? That is<br />\na subjective matter, but<br />\nirreleveant since the rules have<br />\nbeen established and all the<br />\nowners are free to use them.<br />\nAs for Billy Martin's .problems<br />\nin coping with a team of<br />\nego-maniacs, it is entirely to his<br />\nand the teams credit that they<br />\ncan continue winning while<br />\nbelittling each other and the<br /><br />\nowner. High -priced teams, loaded<br />\nwith stars and egos, have been<br />\nassembled before and lost. The<br />\nOakland Athletics are a notable<br />\nexception and it should come as<br />\nno surprise that the heart of that<br />\nteam now plays for the Yankees.<br />\nBall games can only be won on<br />\nthe field and not bought. It took<br />\nsensational play form Mickey<br />\nRivers, Thurman Munson, Ron<br />\nGuidry, and Sparky Lyle, for the<br />\nYankees to capture the pennant.<br />\nThese players were all with the<br />\nteam last year along with Graig<br />\nNettles and Chris Chambliss. A<br />\nchampionship team was here long<br />\nbefore Don Gullet and Reggie<br />\nJackson donned pinstripes.<br />\nFurthermore, it is debatable how<br />\nvaluable the free agents are to the<br />\nteam. It took stellar<br />\nperformances at all positions for<br />\nthe Yankees to repeat as<br />\nchampions and all three free<br />\nagents either performed poorly<br />\nor not at all in the play-offs. As<br />\nso often happens a relatively<br /><br />\nall season.<br />\nIt is time to steer attention<br />\naway from overpublicized club<br />\nhouse chatter and back to the<br />\nfield where it belongs. At first<br />\nbase, Steve Garvey epitomizeil<br />\nwhat the Dodgers are about.<br />\nPerformance and sportsmanship<br />\nare his trademark . He is strong<br />\nin all aspects of the game and a<br />\nteam leader. A solid hitter and<br />\nfielder, Chris Chambliss<br />\nexemplifies many of the same<br />\nqualities. He had a poor play-offs<br />\nat bat, but should turn around in<br />\nthe series. The edge goes to the<br />\nDodgers.<br />\nAt second base and shortstop,<br />\nthe Dodgers , again have a slight<br />\nedge. Bill Russell is a sometimes<br />\nerratic fielder but comes up with<br />\nthe big play. Dave Lopes adds a<br />\ndimension of speed to the lineup.<br />\nThe Yanks' Bucky Dent and<br />\nWillie Randolph are better<br />\nfielders, but not as consistent at<br />\nbat.<br /><br />\nAt third base, Ron Cey and<br />\nGraig Nettles have almost<br />\nidentical statistics this season<br />\nwith Nettles slightly ahead. Both<br />\nWill be key players for theirteams with the Yanks getting the<br />\nedge on this one.<br />\nOn the mound the Dodgers<br />\nshould get better starting<br />\npitching from Don Sutton and<br />\nTommy John. Ron Guidry will<br />\noffset part of it and the Yanks<br />\nmust hope that someone can<br />\nback him up. In the bullpen<br />\nSparky Lyle should provide the<br />\nbetter support with the Dodge's<br />\nweak only by comparison. Both<br />\nteams have excellent reserve<br />\nstrength but in a short series it is<br />\ndifficult to judge its importance.<br />\nIt should be a close and<br />\ncompetitive series with the<br />\nYankshhaving home field<br />\nadvantage.

His personality on<br />\nfirst contact might seem to be<br />\nquite \"the unapproachable<br />\nhuman being\" but this \u2022 initH<br />\nimpression quickly changes.

Six-foot four,<br />\nblond, and with legs so long that<br />\none can only laugh about the<br />\ntrouble he must have finding<br />\njeans that fit, he is more reserved<br />\nthan Brad but still slightly crazy<br />\nnonetheless.<br />\nBrad: I can identify with you so<br />\nmuch, Charles. When you choked<br />\nthat first race (Loyola). I knew<br />\nyou were going to, everybody<br />\ndoes. When I was a freshman, I<br />\nburned out every practice, then<br />\nI'd get out there at the race, burn<br />\nthe first mile and tie up so badly<br />\nafter that that I couldn't move I<br />\nwas so tight.<br />\nCharles:I've been doing that all<br />\nalong.

And now my<br />\nvegetarianism is more selfish and<br />\nself\u2014centered and to hell with<br />\nthat stuff.<br />\nBrad: And you have to be<br />\nself-centered. Charles:And it's<br />\nall developed. As you progress<br />\nyou take notice of that<br />\nprogression.<br /><br />\nthought \"My god, I'm going to<br />\nout so long for,\" and I was<br />\nrunning right away.
