At least 18 of ducredits must be in Humanities ol\u2022<br />\nSocial Sciences.<br />\nThe original proposal for the<br />\nB.E.S. degree was formulated last<br />\nyear by the CUS and then sent to<br />\nthe departments which offer engineering courses, for modifieaitons, before it was approved<br />\nyesterday.<br />\n\"With this new program, it will<br />\nhopefully improve the flexibility<br />\nof the B.E.S. curriculum and allow the majors to take more<br />\ncourses in other areas,\" Holik<br />\nstated.<br />\nHe revealed that one CUS<br />\nmember explained that B.E.S.<br />\nmajors, who, under the old regu-<br />\n<br />\nlation could only take 24 credits<br />\nin outside areas, are now eligible<br />\nto enroll in up to 50 credits of<br />\nnon-engineering courses.<br />\n\"This should remove the rigid<br />\ncurriculum engineering students<br />\nhad to take; it matches the more<br />\nliberal B.A. degree,\" Holik commented.<br />\nThe CUS also opened discussion on independent study and<br />\nresearch grading, prompted \"by a<br />\nletter from an undergraduate<br />\nstating that students get a'gut' A<br />\ngrade for research that has never<br />\nbeen clearly outlined,\" Honk<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"We discussed how to deal<br />\nwith this problem, keeping in<br />\nmind that independent study and<br />\nresearch is the backbone of<br />\neducation here,\" he commented.<br />\nThe undergraduate member revealed that although no action<br />\nwas taken, one faculty representative suggested that the first two<br />\nsemesters of independent study<br />\nbe pass-fail. Any future research<br />\nwould be graded.<br />\nHolik explained that the average grade for . independent research is now a 3.6. or 3.7, and<br />\naccording to a study by CUS undergraduate member Jon Bell,<br />\nthis grade level has been consistent for the past five years.<br />\n\"This is high average, mostly<br />\nA's and B's,\" Holik asserted.<br />\n<br />\nMembers of the Mathematics<br />\nDepartment also criticized the<br />\nSC's findings as well as the manner in which the SC completed<br />\nthe Reports.<br />\nDr. Jean Meyer, Mathematics,<br />\ncommented, \"The initial version<br />\nof the report on the Math department was anything but responsi\"<br />\nble.Acting department chairman<br />\nPhillip Hartman said he refused to<br />\naccept the final copy of the -report because the Council went<br />\nback on its pledge to show a revised draft of the report before publishing the final edition.<br />\nThe Academic Council took<br />\nthe Reports under consideration<br />\nat its meeting Wednesday, where,<br />\naccording to one member, they<br />\nwere received, to some extent,<br />\nwith dismay.<br />\n-In a typically unrealistic way,<br />\nthe Council is viewing the Reports with alarm,\" observed one<br />\nmember.<br />\nThe AC will conduct a special<br />\nmeeting Tuesday for further consideration of the reports.<br />\nSaid AC member Dr. Elias<br />\nRivers, Rivers, Romance Languages, \"Some members of the AC<br />\nwere upset at the reports for fear<br />\nthat they would be used by deans<br />\nand other members of the administration in the promotion process.\"<br />\n\"It's dangerous in the hands of<br />\nthe administration,\" he added.<br />\nAnother AC member, Dr. J.<br />\nHoward, Political<br />\nWoodford<br />\nScience, cited \"the short-sighted-,<br />\nness of the way in which the report was done.\"<br />\nStudents have other things to<br />\ndo than evaluate programs,\" he<br />\nnoted.<br />\nSeveral AC members, however,<br />\ncomplimented the Reports, calling them \"well done.\"<br />\n\"They were constructive and<br />\nwell though-out, commented Dr.<br />\nCarl Christ, Political Economy.<br />\n\"Alot of work went into them.\"<br />\n.

Edidin will instead teach Evolutionary Concepts, which will form a sevencredit sequence in conjunction<br />\nwith Principles of Physiology, for<br />\nnon-majors.<br />\nThe elimination of Biological<br />\nConcepts means that majors will<br />\nno longer have an Option in their<br />\ncore requirements.<br />\nAlso, majors will be required<br />\nto take Cell Biology Lab and Biochemistry Lab. Previously, Biology majors needed to take any<br />\ntwo labs in the discipline to fulfill their requirements.<br />\nIn addition, changes Were<br />\nmade in the requirements for advanced programs.<br />\nThe changes in the requirements for biology majors were<br />\nmade in an attempt to clarify the<br />\ndiscipline while Still providing an<br />\nopen program that is flexible to<br />\n<br />\nthe needs of the individual students, according to department<br />\nmembers.<br />\nDr. Robert Ballentine, undergraduate advising coordinator for<br />\nthe department, drafted the revisions after the faculty suggested<br />\nan a recent staff meeting a refinement of the requirement and a<br />\nremoval of their ambiguity for<br />\nthe new catalogue text..<br />\nBallentine stated, \"No change'<br />\nwas made in the overall point requirement.\"<br />\nOption<br />\n\"Students will not have an option in regards to core requirements but otherwise the program<br />\nis fairly open.

I think this will be the<br />\nworst year we've seen,\" stated<br />\nPlacement Bureau Director<br />\nMarilyn Bugg.<br />\nBugg said, however, \"Hopkins<br />\nstudents in particular have a real<br />\nadvantage in seeking employment. Hopkins is the best school<br />\nin the state and one of the best in<br />\nthe country. This makes students<br />\nhere more competitive.\"<br />\nEngineering and economics<br />\nmajors should- fare better than<br />\nmost in their efforts to land jobs<br />\nBugg said. She refuted a statement by the College Placement<br />\nCouncil that economic ills are affecting opportunities for engineering students as well.<br />\n\"We have no fears for engineering students.\" Economic majors are also in increasing demand, according to Bugg.<br />\nThe number of recruiters that<br />\ncome to Hopkins has dropped<br />\ndramatically this year. In addition, those who come have fewer positions available than in past<br />\nyears.<br />\nImproving the tight employment outlook somewhat is a joint<br />\neffort by the Placement and<br />\nAlumni Relations Offices to engage alumni in assisting undergraduates both in job hunting<br />\nand in making career decisions.<br />\n\"We're taking active steps to<br />\novercome a bad year,\" Bugg said.<br />\nBugg commented .that \"the<br />\nwhole gamut of Hopkins' sttidents\" use her office for the purpose of seeking job placement<br />\nand not merely fringe students<br />\nwho could not obtain admission<br />\nto graduate schools. \"We get<br />\nmany students who do well in all<br />\nfields and just can't make up<br />\ntheir minds as to what they want<br />\nto do.

That would make this speech<br />\nso much easier.\"<br />\nHeller's remarks were introduced by John Barth, a colleague<br />\nand personal friend of Heller.<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nBarth noted facetiously, \"Twenty-two years after writing it,<br />\nCatch-22 is still selling like MacDonald's hamburger.\"<br />\nBefore turning over the floor<br />\nto Heller, Barth pointed (Art that<br />\nit took nine years for Heller to<br />\ncomplete Catch-22, his first novel, and about as long to finish<br />\nhis next work, Something.

During the process of writing, it's a<br />\nprivate, personal experience.<br />\nWhat I enjoy most is the sheer<br />\nintimacy of that and the knowledge that what I'm doing, I'm<br />\ndoing as well as I can.\"<br />\nNeurotic<br />\nHeller, in explaining parts or<br />\nhis own writing process, stated,<br />\n\"I rewrite my material terribly,<br />\ncompulsively, neurotically.

When they vote on the referendum on the Honor Commission in the next two weeks, they<br />\nwill decide not only the fate of the Honor System for themselves, but for future undergraduates as well. A vote for proctoring Would mean that even in theory, that Hopkins student does not pursue knowledge as an end to be desired in<br />\nand Of itself but is merely concerned with achieving good<br />\ngrades towards some material end. Perhaps the resolution of<br />\nthe present cheating problem would be best served by a proctoring system, but the dam'age such -a move would effect to<br />\nthe academic atmosphere here and the undergraduate's selfimage would probably undo any good that might be accomplished. In this case, the cure would be worse than the illness.<br />\nOf course, the refutation of the Student Council-Honor<br />\nCommission proposal at the polls would only be the first<br />\nstep. Undergraduates must learn to work honestly and in<br />\naccordance with the Honor code.

So<br />\nadept was he that everyone (except<br />\nthe faculty) waited expectantly for<br />\neach new volume ofjokes he published, wondering in an amused<br />\nmanner what his next subject of<br />\nmerriment would be. Undoubtedly<br />\nhe was a favorite among undergraduates. (Black &.\u2022 Bluejay editorial,<br />\nFeb. 1925)<br />\nThe subject of merriment has<br />\nbeen a vital force through mostly<br />\n<br />\nunrecognized tradition in Hopkins<br />\nlife. The Black & Bluejay humor<br />\nmagazine, begun in 1921 by undergraduates and published eight<br />\ntimes yearlyfor fourteen years, was<br />\nthe first attempt at a student publication representative of the broad<br />\nspectrum of Hopkins sentiment.<br />\nSince its demise the smile of parody and low jest, if not unnoticed,<br />\nhas gone unpublished. In this vacuum a group of undergraduates<br />\nmet to discuss the formation of a<br />\nnew humor magazine.<br />\nPart of the facetious tradition<br />\nwere the pranks engendered by<br />\n<br />\nclass rivalries as well as unrelated<br />\nincidents in the dorms and elsewhere, passed in jest, but mostly<br />\ndiscarded in the changes of humorous taste. The forms of undergraduate merriment have been as imaginative as freshmen are forever<br />\ngullible.

Mark is a threetime college division All-American'<br />\nand has been a perennial MasonDixon and Middle Atlantic Conference champion. Mark's high school<br />\n100-yard butterfly time of 52.1<br />\nwas one of the top 25 times ever<br />\nrecorded by a school boy in that<br />\nevent and earned Mark high school<br />\nAll-American honors as well as a<br />\nnational ranking.<br />\nUnfortunately, however, in<br />\nMark's four year career at Hopkins<br />\nhe has been unable to improve on<br />\nhis high school time. And after taking into consideration the fact that<br />\nMark was a nationally ranked<br />\nswimmer in high school, it is alsc<br />\nunfortunate to note that Mark is<br />\nnot a nationally. ranked University<br />\nDivision swimmer in the NCAA Division I championship swimmer today. Mark competed against University Division swimmers in the<br />\nNCAA Division I championship his<br />\nfreshman and sophomore seasons<br />\nand performed poorly. But in his\u2022<br />\njunior year, Mark failed to even<br />\nparticipate in the Division I championships and he will most likely<br />\nskip the Meet again this year.<br />\nI find it hard to believe that<br />\nMark has been satisfied with his<br />\nsmall college All-American honors,<br />\nbut the fact that he once competed<br />\nand excelled at all indicates that<br />\nthis is so. I also find it difficult to<br />\nunderstand why an athletic program would be unable to motivate<br />\nsomeone with Mark's talent. How-<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\n<br />\n(these meets provide a swim-<br />\n<br />\nwith the highest level of competition in swimming today.) The<br />\nswim program, which Mark speaks<br />\nso highly of, apparently fails to<br />\nprovide the motivation to excel or<br />\nto push to the limit of capabilities<br />\nand talents.<br />\nMaybe then some sort of definition of athletics is needed before<br />\nMark can be named \"Athlete of<br />\nthe Week.\" I'm of the opinion that<br />\nathletics include an effort to realize<br />\none's full potential and require<br />\ndedication and commitment.<br />\nTherefore I would be hesitant to<br />\nrefer to Mark Horning as an athlete<br />\nand maybe \"Talented Individual of<br />\nthe Week\" would be a more appropriate title for Mr. Horning.

His titillating style,<br />\nhis verve and zest\u2014reading him is<br />\nindeed an enervating experience. I<br />\nstill marvel at his ability to compress so few thoughts into so many<br />\nwords. In short, he is a paragon of<br />\nliterary virtue\u2014the very quintessence of unctuosity.

However, some memories were collected by certain<br />\nalumni. Neil Grauer, '69, for one<br />\nrecalls that when he was a freshman \"jackets and ties were required attire for Sunday dinner in<br />\nthe dormitory dining room.\" A<br />\nrule flaunted \"by several freshmen<br />\nwho wore a sports jacket and necktie\u2014but no shirts or trousers\u2014to<br />\nthe Sunday meal.\" Another legendary incident stemmed from the tradition of prescribed hours when females were allowed to visit the dormitories; \"the door of one's room<br />\nhad to be kept open the width of a<br />\nmatch box.\" The incident occurred<br />\nwhen an \"inebriated freshman and<br />\nhis girlfriend literally copulated in<br />\nfront of an enthusiastic gathering<br />\nof dormitory residents and the<br />\ndorm master, who observed that<br />\nno rule was being broken because<br />\nthe door was indeed open much<br />\nwider than a match box.\"<br />\nStories like these evidence the<br />\nvitality and the changing taste of<br />\ncollege humor. The gilded age of<br />\nthe Black & Bluejay has become<br />\nquite tarnished. The bounds of<br />\npopular taste are not only bounded<br />\nby libel. As a facetious topic pornography hasbeen castrated.<br />\nWhat remains for a new humor<br />\nmagazine is the vast arrogance of<br />\nacademic pretentiousness, whether<br />\n<br />\n/1,t.,<br />\nIii,,,,<br />\nmight seem like a distasteful joke.<br />\nBut it is not the purpose of this<br />\n<br />\nmagazine to laugh at the misery of<br />\nothers. We do that everyday. Rather we premise our merriment on<br />\nthe assumption that as long as<br />\ninstitutions and people keep their<br />\nillusions there will always be someone to poke fun at.<br />\nIn the pendulum swing of generations of Hopkins students there<br />\nis both constancy and irony. From<br />\nthe stilted sophistication of the<br />\nBlack & Bluejay to the equally romantic, if natural ludicrousness of<br />\nour conception, there is the same<br />\nstruggle for self expression, albeit<br />\nwithout the sense of community<br />\nthat was Hopkins in the twenties.<br />\nLaughter is perhaps the only<br />\nhealthy reaction to a world increasingly insane. Thus we should have<br />\na last laugh knowing that others<br />\nwill do the same, and then maybe<br />\nwe can keep on laughing as A.B.<br />\nFaust suggested when he wrote in<br />\nthe first student publication at<br />\nHopkins, The Debutante of 1889:<br />\n\"Classmates: We are nearly ready<br />\nto be hurled upon the world in an<br />\nexploding bomb. While the preparations for the shot are being made,<br />\na few moments are yet left to us to<br />\njoin once more in friendship before<br />\nour final parting; and while we are<br />\nthus gathered together, let us try<br />\nto live over again the three years so<br />\nquickly passed and so filled with<br />\npleasant recollections.

Once he<br />\naccepts this, he can concentrate on<br />\nreceiving an education, academic<br />\nor otherwise, at the institution he<br />\nattends. He will not worry about<br />\nthe night life in D.C. or the wilds<br />\nof Middlebury, or other collegiate<br />\nparadises.<br />\nII<br />\n\"Colleges are merely practice<br />\ngrounds for future leaders.\"<br />\n--Hopkins Senior<br />\nThe realization that all colleges<br />\nare basically alike tends to breed<br />\nan apathy towards the trivial and<br />\noften pointless controversies at a<br />\nschool. Currently, examples of this<br />\nat Hopkins are the upcoming Student Council elections and the<br />\ntroubles of the Honor Commission.<br />\nPut simply, student councils are<br />\n<br />\nof anger. Those who are elected<br />\nshould feel honored but not expect<br />\nglory, for their election enables<br />\nthem to complement their education by working with the council.<br />\nTell The Truth<br />\nA controversy which is perhaps<br />\nmore peculiar to Hopkins is the<br />\nfailing of the Honor Commission.<br />\nTo the motivated student this<br />\nsquabble should have no relevance.<br />\nAs a friend said recently: \"I don't<br />\ncare if we have to take tests in individual booths. I don't cheat.\" It is<br />\nnot worth being involved in a dispute such as this, one which is tedious with jargon and petty in battle. If a person does not cheat he<br />\ncan rise above local affairs such as<br />\nthis and pursue an education unencumbered by the provinciality that<br />\ndictates the construction of such a<br />\ncommission.<br />\nThe difficulties and annoyances<br />\nfound at Hopkins are present at all<br />\nsimilar institutions, in one form or<br />\nanother. The Honor Commission<br />\ndebate is replaced by numerous situations at other schools. These<br />\ncontroversies are often immersed<br />\nin immediate rage, and ,students are<br />\nsusceptible to their attractions. But<br />\nthese problems are not unique to<br />\nHopkins. Once the student transcends the temporal struggles of a<br />\nschool, and accepts his presence<br />\nthere, he can obtain an education<br />\nunaided by people and organizations who attempt to practice \"real<br />\nity\" upon him.<br />\n<br />\nThE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n,.... ,<br />\n...,1<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n...\u201e..<br />\n<br />\n.;<br />\ns<br />\n<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness =nag&<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editors<br />\nproduction consultant<br />\n<br />\nIfarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br />\nLinda Joy<br />\nJay Goodgold, Lainy Stephans<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\n\u2022 Russ Smith<br />\nMike Bloch, Jeffrey Posner<br />\nStephan Levin, Robert RosenWaser,byton Blick<br />\n<br />\nstaff writers: Tony Adnerson, Ellen Bernhard, Bot Buchanan, Joe<br />\nBuscema, Tom Connor, Rich D'Agostino, Bob Danner, Steven<br />\nEaddy, Sue Eyrich, Laura Feigin, Pat Flannery, Patrice Gallagher,<br />\nLeonard Levie, Rich Lorraine, Michael Manes, Tom Melia, Taula<br />\nTarnapol, John Tetlaff, Liz Wallace, David _Warren, Joe ,Rodrigue<br />\nproduction: Craig Nankin, Joe Lob!, Mary Anne Reilly, William<br />\nTalialerro..

Such journals as Harry, The<br />\nPaper, Performance, and City Dweller<br />\nhave begged me and countless others to<br />\nread them. Quick to label them trash in<br />\nthe face of the established weeklies I<br />\ncould be reading instead, I disregarded<br />\nthem all.<br />\nLast semester, I decided to break this<br />\nbad habit. I started reading the Port City<br />\nNews, as:it was the only surviving rag. On<br />\nFebruary 13th I picked up the paper for<br />\nthe last time. It did not appear on 27th as<br />\nit was supposed to. (I was distressed for<br />\nall my hopes of establishing the Baltimroe<br />\nHedonist byline vanished! Where else<br />\ncould such nonsense be printed but in the<br />\npages of an alternative newspaper. Christ<br />\nif the bartender of The Clark Street Garage could have column there so could I.)<br />\nHoping that the editors were not run<br />\nout of town or anything like that, I went<br />\ndown to their office on 714 Park Avenue<br />\nto find out what was going on. I had no<br />\nidea of what 714 would look like or<br />\nwhere it would be. Newspapers tend to be<br />\npublished in the seedier sides of town:<br />\nnot only does the warehouse school of<br />\nfunctional architecture best accomodate<br />\ntheir needs, but commanding positions<br />\nare easily obtained on the outskirts of a<br />\nmetropolis rather than in the vulnerable<br />\nheart of the city. Witness the New York<br />\nTimes on the west end of Forty-third<br />\nStreet in New York, the A.S. Abell plant<br />\noverlooking Baltimore harbor, and even<br />\nthe Gatehouse here on campus. I was surprised and impressed by the elegant Mt.<br />\nVernon headquarters of the Port City<br />\nNews. I pressed the doorbell, and in the<br />\n<br />\nvalra<br />\n<br />\nStaWSASSlzfl<br />\n<br />\nlagers dared to think as uptown wouldn't<br />\ndare.\"<br />\n\u2022 For a writer and artist it was quite the<br />\nplace to live in. It was then, as it was later<br />\nfashioned by the Beat Generation, a haven for young .intellectuals to challenge<br />\nthe establishment ideology. Anarchists,<br />\ncommunists, socialists, muckrakers, critics, poets and artists were all welcome<br />\nand given a chance to express themselves<br />\nwhether in a salon discussion, or in the<br />\npages of Max Eastman's remarkably liberal magazine, The Masses.<br />\nEastman left Columbia to work as<br />\nmanaging editor for $25 a week\u2014which<br />\nhe had to provide himself by syliciting<br />\nmoney from the well-to-do intellectuals<br />\nwho were interested in keeping the magazine going: the lesser Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, and Whitney. All of the contributions from the writers and artists were<br />\nmade with no thought of payment. Their<br />\narticles and drawings were based or<br />\nwomen's suffrage, workmen's compensation, safety conditions in the mines, and<br />\neven a more revolutionary idea, the formation of a League of Nations.<br />\nThe lessons Eastman learned as editor<br />\n\u2022were detailed in his remarkable study,<br />\nJournalism Versus Art (1916). Despite his<br />\nliterary convictions, he knew that successful journalism could never be literature. It<br />\nwas business. He knew that a good magazine writer cannot \"allow himself to flow<br />\ninto his pen, for then, though he will captivate those who like that kind of a self,<br />\nhe will offend those who do not. In order<br />\nto please everybody and offend none, lie<br />\nmust eliminate all these warm and spontaneous impulses that are his very own,.<br />\nwhatever they be, and confine his efforts<br />\nto the creation of superficially and obviously 'pleasant' qualities, like fluency,.<br />\n<br />\nanxious moments I waited, on the brownstone steps, I began to picture the demise<br />\nof a literary experiment --not to mention<br />\nthat of the Port City News. I mused: A<br />\nman is either living or earning his living.<br />\nHe is never doing these two things, purely, at once.

In 1912, like many other intellectuals, he ventured to Greenwich Village. In the years 1910-1914, that community flourished on a scale that has never been equalled in the intellectual history of this country. The artists John<br />\nSloan, George Bellows, Art Young, Stuart<br />\nDavis, John Butler Yeats, Rockwell Kent,<br />\nand Robert Henri lived with the writers<br />\nVan Wyck Brooks, John Reed, Max Eastman, Hutchins Hapgood, Floyd Dell, Walter Lippman, Ernest Poole, and Carl Van<br />\nVechten. They ate in the same restaurants, drank in the same bars, and frequented the salons of Mabel Dodge,<br />\nAlfred Stieglitz and others to discuss the<br />\npressing issues of the day. They collaborated in the novel utterance of such magazines as The Call, The Little Revies, and<br />\ntheNew Republic that attacked obsolete<br />\nmores and thought. As Floyd Dell put it<br />\nin his, Looking at Life, they basked in<br />\n\"the golden sunlight of the twentieth century\" that was so different from the<br />\n\"dark, strange\" one that preceded it. As<br />\nJohn Reed classified the group: \"The Vil-<br />\n<br />\ngm==al:m=332g vs35:55=;43:Zai:a3:5A VARA<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 and wit, and theglamour of sexuality and<br />\n-money, and a -few touches of pathos and<br />\npurity, and no difficulty for the understanding.

I met Richard<br />\nBronson, the editor-in-chief, who was<br />\nalone in the office. He told me that the<br />\npaper had folded due to lack of funds.<br />\nThat was the case. Whereas some recent<br />\npapers in Washington have been launched<br />\non a fifty or one hundred thousand dollar<br />\ninvestment, the Port City News published<br />\nfor six months on an eleven thousand dollar base. One of the reasons it was able to<br />\nsurvive for so long was that the editors<br />\nand production staff owned Octopus,<br />\nInc., an advertising and graphic arts firm<br />\nthat did the art, layout, and copywork<br />\nfor free. There was only a paltry salary<br />\nfor those who worked steadily on the paper. There was no money to attract professional writers and commercial artists.<br />\nThere were not good advertising and distribution directors working to entrench<br />\nthe paper in the city. Successful advertising is the lifeblood of the modern press.<br />\nIndividual over-the-counter sales covered<br />\nthe publicity of the paper since there<br />\nweren't enough funds to pay for the services of Maryland News, the leading distributors in the area. The'Baltimore paper<br />\ndid find its way to Essex, Dundalk,<br />\nTimonium, and Owings Mills.<br />\nThose who did write for the paper on a<br />\nregular basis were talented enough to<br />\nwriteinteresting features, and columns<br />\nsuch as \"Jazz Ave.\" and \"The Betting<br />\nBartender\" did spark the paper.

Undoubtedly<br />\nhe was a favorite among undergraduates. (Black &amp;.\u2022 Bluejay editorial,<br />\nFeb. 1925)<br />\nThe subject of merriment has<br />\nbeen a vital force through mostly<br /><br />\nunrecognized tradition in Hopkins<br />\nlife. The Black &amp; Bluejay humor<br />\nmagazine, begun in 1921 by undergraduates and published eight<br />\ntimes yearlyfor fourteen years, was<br />\nthe first attempt at a student publication representative of the broad<br />\nspectrum of Hopkins sentiment.<br />\nSince its demise the smile of parody and low jest, if not unnoticed,<br />\nhas gone unpublished. In this vacuum a group of undergraduates<br />\nmet to discuss the formation of a<br />\nnew humor magazine.<br />\nPart of the facetious tradition<br />\nwere the pranks engendered by<br /><br />\nclass rivalries as well as unrelated<br />\nincidents in the dorms and elsewhere, passed in jest, but mostly<br />\ndiscarded in the changes of humorous taste. The forms of undergraduate merriment have been as imaginative as freshmen are forever<br />\ngullible.

Mark is a threetime college division All-American'<br />\nand has been a perennial MasonDixon and Middle Atlantic Conference champion. Mark's high school<br />\n100-yard butterfly time of 52.1<br />\nwas one of the top 25 times ever<br />\nrecorded by a school boy in that<br />\nevent and earned Mark high school<br />\nAll-American honors as well as a<br />\nnational ranking.<br />\nUnfortunately, however, in<br />\nMark's four year career at Hopkins<br />\nhe has been unable to improve on<br />\nhis high school time. And after taking into consideration the fact that<br />\nMark was a nationally ranked<br />\nswimmer in high school, it is alsc<br />\nunfortunate to note that Mark is<br />\nnot a nationally. ranked University<br />\nDivision swimmer in the NCAA Division I championship swimmer today. Mark competed against University Division swimmers in the<br />\nNCAA Division I championship his<br />\nfreshman and sophomore seasons<br />\nand performed poorly. But in his\u2022<br />\njunior year, Mark failed to even<br />\nparticipate in the Division I championships and he will most likely<br />\nskip the Meet again this year.<br />\nI find it hard to believe that<br />\nMark has been satisfied with his<br />\nsmall college All-American honors,<br />\nbut the fact that he once competed<br />\nand excelled at all indicates that<br />\nthis is so. I also find it difficult to<br />\nunderstand why an athletic program would be unable to motivate<br />\nsomeone with Mark's talent. How-<br /><br />\nF<br /><br />\n(these meets provide a swim-<br /><br />\nwith the highest level of competition in swimming today.) The<br />\nswim program, which Mark speaks<br />\nso highly of, apparently fails to<br />\nprovide the motivation to excel or<br />\nto push to the limit of capabilities<br />\nand talents.<br />\nMaybe then some sort of definition of athletics is needed before<br />\nMark can be named \"Athlete of<br />\nthe Week.\" I'm of the opinion that<br />\nathletics include an effort to realize<br />\none's full potential and require<br />\ndedication and commitment.<br />\nTherefore I would be hesitant to<br />\nrefer to Mark Horning as an athlete<br />\nand maybe \"Talented Individual of<br />\nthe Week\" would be a more appropriate title for Mr. Horning.

His titillating style,<br />\nhis verve and zest\u2014reading him is<br />\nindeed an enervating experience. I<br />\nstill marvel at his ability to compress so few thoughts into so many<br />\nwords. In short, he is a paragon of<br />\nliterary virtue\u2014the very quintessence of unctuosity.

However, some memories were collected by certain<br />\nalumni. Neil Grauer, '69, for one<br />\nrecalls that when he was a freshman \"jackets and ties were required attire for Sunday dinner in<br />\nthe dormitory dining room.\" A<br />\nrule flaunted \"by several freshmen<br />\nwho wore a sports jacket and necktie\u2014but no shirts or trousers\u2014to<br />\nthe Sunday meal.\" Another legendary incident stemmed from the tradition of prescribed hours when females were allowed to visit the dormitories; \"the door of one's room<br />\nhad to be kept open the width of a<br />\nmatch box.\" The incident occurred<br />\nwhen an \"inebriated freshman and<br />\nhis girlfriend literally copulated in<br />\nfront of an enthusiastic gathering<br />\nof dormitory residents and the<br />\ndorm master, who observed that<br />\nno rule was being broken because<br />\nthe door was indeed open much<br />\nwider than a match box.\"<br />\nStories like these evidence the<br />\nvitality and the changing taste of<br />\ncollege humor. The gilded age of<br />\nthe Black &amp; Bluejay has become<br />\nquite tarnished. The bounds of<br />\npopular taste are not only bounded<br />\nby libel. As a facetious topic pornography hasbeen castrated.<br />\nWhat remains for a new humor<br />\nmagazine is the vast arrogance of<br />\nacademic pretentiousness, whether<br /><br />\n/1,t.,<br />\nIii,,,,<br />\nmight seem like a distasteful joke.<br />\nBut it is not the purpose of this<br /><br />\nmagazine to laugh at the misery of<br />\nothers. We do that everyday. Rather we premise our merriment on<br />\nthe assumption that as long as<br />\ninstitutions and people keep their<br />\nillusions there will always be someone to poke fun at.<br />\nIn the pendulum swing of generations of Hopkins students there<br />\nis both constancy and irony. From<br />\nthe stilted sophistication of the<br />\nBlack &amp; Bluejay to the equally romantic, if natural ludicrousness of<br />\nour conception, there is the same<br />\nstruggle for self expression, albeit<br />\nwithout the sense of community<br />\nthat was Hopkins in the twenties.<br />\nLaughter is perhaps the only<br />\nhealthy reaction to a world increasingly insane. Thus we should have<br />\na last laugh knowing that others<br />\nwill do the same, and then maybe<br />\nwe can keep on laughing as A.B.<br />\nFaust suggested when he wrote in<br />\nthe first student publication at<br />\nHopkins, The Debutante of 1889:<br />\n\"Classmates: We are nearly ready<br />\nto be hurled upon the world in an<br />\nexploding bomb. While the preparations for the shot are being made,<br />\na few moments are yet left to us to<br />\njoin once more in friendship before<br />\nour final parting; and while we are<br />\nthus gathered together, let us try<br />\nto live over again the three years so<br />\nquickly passed and so filled with<br />\npleasant recollections.

A student council representative is worthy of no more attention, than,<br />\nsay, a tutor or technician, learning<br />\na trade through university resources. Yet as in \"real life\" the politicians on the campus are the most<br />\nvisible and obvious.<br />\nIt is frightening to realize that<br />\nthe national and local governments<br />\nare composed of former college<br />\npresidents and politicos. As in the<br />\n\"real world\" college campuses are<br />\ninundated by reformers and renegades, regulars and hacks, who<br />\ncampaign for office all year,<br />\nthrough sometimes subtle, but<br />\nmore often flagrant, snares at recognition. Everyone says it<br />\nshouldn't be like this at college,<br />\nbut it always is.<br />\nUndoubtedly-, in the current<br />\ncampaign at Hopkins, there will be<br />\nheated exchanges between candidates and ugly feelings. Such theatrics are nonesense, the elections<br />\njust are not important enough to<br />\nget excited about. A plausible case<br />\ncan be made. for voting and it is<br />\nprobably a good idea.

There is competition and<br />\npressure at every prestigious school<br />\nin the United States._<br />\nAl though some Hopkins students whine about Baltimore, most<br />\nof the complaints center on academics, the work load and strain.<br />\nIt is of relative inconsequence<br />\nwhere a school is located, as people<br />\nadjust to their .surroundings, seeking out all they can from a given<br />\narea. Four years is a comparatively<br />\nshort period, not long enough to<br />\nexhaust the resources that a university and its environs have to offer.<br />\nTherefore, it is not particularly important whether a student goes to<br />\nschool in New York, San<br />\nFrancisco, or Baltimore. Once he<br />\naccepts this, he can concentrate on<br />\nreceiving an education, academic<br />\nor otherwise, at the institution he<br />\nattends. He will not worry about<br />\nthe night life in D.C. or the wilds<br />\nof Middlebury, or other collegiate<br />\nparadises.<br />\nII<br />\n\"Colleges are merely practice<br />\ngrounds for future leaders.\"<br />\n--Hopkins Senior<br />\nThe realization that all colleges<br />\nare basically alike tends to breed<br />\nan apathy towards the trivial and<br />\noften pointless controversies at a<br />\nschool. Currently, examples of this<br />\nat Hopkins are the upcoming Student Council elections and the<br />\ntroubles of the Honor Commission.<br />\nPut simply, student councils are<br /><br />\nof anger. Those who are elected<br />\nshould feel honored but not expect<br />\nglory, for their election enables<br />\nthem to complement their education by working with the council.<br />\nTell The Truth<br />\nA controversy which is perhaps<br />\nmore peculiar to Hopkins is the<br />\nfailing of the Honor Commission.<br />\nTo the motivated student this<br />\nsquabble should have no relevance.<br />\nAs a friend said recently: \"I don't<br />\ncare if we have to take tests in individual booths. I don't cheat.\" It is<br />\nnot worth being involved in a dispute such as this, one which is tedious with jargon and petty in battle. If a person does not cheat he<br />\ncan rise above local affairs such as<br />\nthis and pursue an education unencumbered by the provinciality that<br />\ndictates the construction of such a<br />\ncommission.<br />\nThe difficulties and annoyances<br />\nfound at Hopkins are present at all<br />\nsimilar institutions, in one form or<br />\nanother. The Honor Commission<br />\ndebate is replaced by numerous situations at other schools. These<br />\ncontroversies are often immersed<br />\nin immediate rage, and ,students are<br />\nsusceptible to their attractions. But<br />\nthese problems are not unique to<br />\nHopkins. Once the student transcends the temporal struggles of a<br />\nschool, and accepts his presence<br />\nthere, he can obtain an education<br />\nunaided by people and organizations who attempt to practice \"real<br />\nity\" upon him.<br /><br />\nThE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n,.... ,<br />\n...,1<br />\n,<br /><br />\n...\u201e..<br /><br />\n.;<br />\ns<br /><br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness =nag&amp;<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editors<br />\nproduction consultant<br /><br />\nIfarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br />\nLinda Joy<br />\nJay Goodgold, Lainy Stephans<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\n\u2022 Russ Smith<br />\nMike Bloch, Jeffrey Posner<br />\nStephan Levin, Robert RosenWaser,byton Blick<br /><br />\nstaff writers: Tony Adnerson, Ellen Bernhard, Bot Buchanan, Joe<br />\nBuscema, Tom Connor, Rich D'Agostino, Bob Danner, Steven<br />\nEaddy, Sue Eyrich, Laura Feigin, Pat Flannery, Patrice Gallagher,<br />\nLeonard Levie, Rich Lorraine, Michael Manes, Tom Melia, Taula<br />\nTarnapol, John Tetlaff, Liz Wallace, David _Warren, Joe ,Rodrigue<br />\nproduction: Craig Nankin, Joe Lob!, Mary Anne Reilly, William<br />\nTalialerro..

Such journals as Harry, The<br />\nPaper, Performance, and City Dweller<br />\nhave begged me and countless others to<br />\nread them. Quick to label them trash in<br />\nthe face of the established weeklies I<br />\ncould be reading instead, I disregarded<br />\nthem all.<br />\nLast semester, I decided to break this<br />\nbad habit. I started reading the Port City<br />\nNews, as:it was the only surviving rag. On<br />\nFebruary 13th I picked up the paper for<br />\nthe last time. It did not appear on 27th as<br />\nit was supposed to. (I was distressed for<br />\nall my hopes of establishing the Baltimroe<br />\nHedonist byline vanished! Where else<br />\ncould such nonsense be printed but in the<br />\npages of an alternative newspaper. Christ<br />\nif the bartender of The Clark Street Garage could have column there so could I.)<br />\nHoping that the editors were not run<br />\nout of town or anything like that, I went<br />\ndown to their office on 714 Park Avenue<br />\nto find out what was going on. I had no<br />\nidea of what 714 would look like or<br />\nwhere it would be. Newspapers tend to be<br />\npublished in the seedier sides of town:<br />\nnot only does the warehouse school of<br />\nfunctional architecture best accomodate<br />\ntheir needs, but commanding positions<br />\nare easily obtained on the outskirts of a<br />\nmetropolis rather than in the vulnerable<br />\nheart of the city. Witness the New York<br />\nTimes on the west end of Forty-third<br />\nStreet in New York, the A.S. Abell plant<br />\noverlooking Baltimore harbor, and even<br />\nthe Gatehouse here on campus. I was surprised and impressed by the elegant Mt.<br />\nVernon headquarters of the Port City<br />\nNews. I pressed the doorbell, and in the<br /><br />\nvalra<br /><br />\nStaWSASSlzfl<br /><br />\nlagers dared to think as uptown wouldn't<br />\ndare.\"<br />\n\u2022 For a writer and artist it was quite the<br />\nplace to live in. It was then, as it was later<br />\nfashioned by the Beat Generation, a haven for young .intellectuals to challenge<br />\nthe establishment ideology. Anarchists,<br />\ncommunists, socialists, muckrakers, critics, poets and artists were all welcome<br />\nand given a chance to express themselves<br />\nwhether in a salon discussion, or in the<br />\npages of Max Eastman's remarkably liberal magazine, The Masses.<br />\nEastman left Columbia to work as<br />\nmanaging editor for $25 a week\u2014which<br />\nhe had to provide himself by syliciting<br />\nmoney from the well-to-do intellectuals<br />\nwho were interested in keeping the magazine going: the lesser Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, and Whitney. All of the contributions from the writers and artists were<br />\nmade with no thought of payment. Their<br />\narticles and drawings were based or<br />\nwomen's suffrage, workmen's compensation, safety conditions in the mines, and<br />\neven a more revolutionary idea, the formation of a League of Nations.<br />\nThe lessons Eastman learned as editor<br />\n\u2022were detailed in his remarkable study,<br />\nJournalism Versus Art (1916). Despite his<br />\nliterary convictions, he knew that successful journalism could never be literature. It<br />\nwas business. He knew that a good magazine writer cannot \"allow himself to flow<br />\ninto his pen, for then, though he will captivate those who like that kind of a self,<br />\nhe will offend those who do not. In order<br />\nto please everybody and offend none, lie<br />\nmust eliminate all these warm and spontaneous impulses that are his very own,.<br />\nwhatever they be, and confine his efforts<br />\nto the creation of superficially and obviously 'pleasant' qualities, like fluency,.<br /><br />\nanxious moments I waited, on the brownstone steps, I began to picture the demise<br />\nof a literary experiment --not to mention<br />\nthat of the Port City News. I mused: A<br />\nman is either living or earning his living.<br />\nHe is never doing these two things, purely, at once. And the literature we love is<br />\nthe literature whose motive is pure -living<br />\nIt is the utter and extreme play of the<br />\ncentral nervous system ofan organism tragically committed by its heredity to the<br />\ncontinual performance of work. In that<br />\nplay alone are the serious things born.<br />\nMax Eastman<br />\nJournalism Versus Art<br />\nMax Eastman assisted John Dewey as a<br />\nlecturer in philosophy and aesthetics at<br />\nColumbia. In 1912, like many other intellectuals, he ventured to Greenwich Village. In the years 1910-1914, that community flourished on a scale that has never been equalled in the intellectual history of this country. The artists John<br />\nSloan, George Bellows, Art Young, Stuart<br />\nDavis, John Butler Yeats, Rockwell Kent,<br />\nand Robert Henri lived with the writers<br />\nVan Wyck Brooks, John Reed, Max Eastman, Hutchins Hapgood, Floyd Dell, Walter Lippman, Ernest Poole, and Carl Van<br />\nVechten. They ate in the same restaurants, drank in the same bars, and frequented the salons of Mabel Dodge,<br />\nAlfred Stieglitz and others to discuss the<br />\npressing issues of the day. They collaborated in the novel utterance of such magazines as The Call, The Little Revies, and<br />\ntheNew Republic that attacked obsolete<br />\nmores and thought. As Floyd Dell put it<br />\nin his, Looking at Life, they basked in<br />\n\"the golden sunlight of the twentieth century\" that was so different from the<br />\n\"dark, strange\" one that preceded it. As<br />\nJohn Reed classified the group: \"The Vil-<br /><br />\ngm==al:m=332g vs35:55=;43:Zai:a3:5A VARA<br /><br />\n\u2022 and wit, and theglamour of sexuality and<br />\n-money, and a -few touches of pathos and<br />\npurity, and no difficulty for the understanding. Everybody likes this a little, and<br />\nnobody dislikes it much.\"<br />\nWhen the buzzer sounded, I walked UP<br />\nthe stairs to the second story headquarters of the Port City News. I met Richard<br />\nBronson, the editor-in-chief, who was<br />\nalone in the office. He told me that the<br />\npaper had folded due to lack of funds.<br />\nThat was the case. Whereas some recent<br />\npapers in Washington have been launched<br />\non a fifty or one hundred thousand dollar<br />\ninvestment, the Port City News published<br />\nfor six months on an eleven thousand dollar base. One of the reasons it was able to<br />\nsurvive for so long was that the editors<br />\nand production staff owned Octopus,<br />\nInc., an advertising and graphic arts firm<br />\nthat did the art, layout, and copywork<br />\nfor free. There was only a paltry salary<br />\nfor those who worked steadily on the paper. There was no money to attract professional writers and commercial artists.<br />\nThere were not good advertising and distribution directors working to entrench<br />\nthe paper in the city. Successful advertising is the lifeblood of the modern press.<br />\nIndividual over-the-counter sales covered<br />\nthe publicity of the paper since there<br />\nweren't enough funds to pay for the services of Maryland News, the leading distributors in the area.

Prior to this week,<br />\ncoaches Oles and Green were not<br />\nable to substitute because the A<br />\nteam consisted of only the four<br />\nstarters. Because this problem<br />\nwas so critical, especially on days<br />\nwhen Hopkins fenced two<br />\nopponents, the coaches reluctantly brought tip three newcomers<br />\nfrom the B team. Against Vanderbilt this week, in a meet won<br />\nby Hopkins 124, two new Hopkins' swordswomen, Arna Cohen<br />\nand Diane Goldstein, though not<br />\ncompletely ready for collegiate<br />\ncompetition, won their first<br />\nbouts ever as Hopkins' fencers,<br />\nwith Diane shutting out her opponent 4-0.<br />\nOf the seven victories of the<br />\nwomen fencers, six have been by<br />\na score of 11-5 or better. \"This<br />\nseems to indicate a wide disparity<br />\nin women's fencing between the<br />\nupper division teams, those that<br />\nare nationally competitive, and<br />\nthose of the lower division,\"<br />\ncoach Green said.<br />\nToday the Hopkins women are<br />\nmeeting two teams that are definitely in that upper division-Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania.
