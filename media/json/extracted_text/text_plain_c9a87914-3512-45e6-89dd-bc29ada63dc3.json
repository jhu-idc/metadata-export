It is hard to lay down fixed rules on<br />\nthis subject. I therefore propose to give<br />\nmerely a few general hints, and to state some<br />\nof my personal experiences in this line of sport.<br />\nFirst, then, as to the bicycle itself. It is not<br />\nWO much trouble to take one's own wheel to<br />\nEurope. The freight across the Atlantic<br />\namounts only to two or three dollars, and, if<br />\nthe wheel be well packed in a wooden box, it<br />\nwill not suffer on the journey. Bicycles can<br />\nbe landed in England free of charge, but on<br />\nthe continent this is not the case. It is, therefore, advisable for tourists intending to cycle<br />\non the continent to join the \"Cyclist's Touring<br />\nClub,\" of England, or the \"Touring Club,\" of<br />\nFrance. To do this, it is necessary only to<br />\nsend the dues to the secretary of either club,<br />\ntogether with the names of two indorsers who<br />\nare already members. The C. T. C. is now<br />\njust as useful on the continent as the C. T. F.,<br />\nand members of the English Club are permitted to take their wheels to the continent without making the usual deposit of ten or twelve<br />\ndollars.<br />\nWith regard to the gear of the wheel, my experience has been that for all round touring,<br />\nwhich is liable to embrace the mountains of<br />\nSwitzerland and Italy, as well as the hills of<br />\nEngland and Scotland, the gear should not<br />\nexceed seventy to seventy-three inches.<br />\nI am a great advocate of the double tire\u2014<br />\nthe Dunlop or any .other good make. Of<br />\ncourse, partisans of the single tube are to be<br />\nfound, but apart from the fact that these tires<br />\nare little used in Europe (and therefore could<br />\nnot be so easily repaired en route in case of a<br />\nserious break), there can be no denying the<br />\n<br />\nNo. 15<br />\n<br />\nfact that, even if the double tire requires<br />\nslightly more labor to mend, the repair once<br />\nmade is more permanent. On the sharp flints<br />\nwhich are found on French roads it is not unusual to puncture one's tire two or three times<br />\nin one afternoon, and a single tube with five<br />\nor six repairs in it becomes, to say the least,<br />\nsomewhat \"porous.\" Beware, intending tourist, of using wooden rims with a clincher-tire<br />\nof the type of the Dunlop. For this experiment I once paid with half an hour of unconsciousness, which came upon me without<br />\nwarning in the middle of a delightful \"coast\"<br />\nin the Shenandoah valley. Let the aspirant<br />\nto the twenty-mile \"coasts\" of the Alps be<br />\nwarned, also, against riding without a brake,<br />\nor using a brake which is in any way inefficient. For this slight lapse from the path of<br />\nperfect prudence I was once rewarded by an<br />\ninstantaneous leap from my wheel on the brink<br />\nof the Ticino, on the St. Gothard, and by the<br />\ndeplorable sight of a mangled front fork. My<br />\nexperience, it will be seen, has been hardearned, and the reader should at least regard<br />\nmy advice as sincere.<br />\nBy all means, ride with a gear case. I have<br />\nridden with one from London to Edinburgh<br />\nand back without once cleaning my chain, and<br />\noiling it only once. In London a gear case<br />\ncan be bought and fitted over the chain for five<br />\nor six dollars.<br />\nMud-guards may be dispensed with, and the<br />\nuse of a lamp may be obviated by arranging<br />\none's schedule so as to reach one's destination<br />\ndaily at a certain time. In Italy, however, the<br />\nregulations about lamps are somewhat severe.<br />\nThere remains the question of baggage, by<br />\nno means a simple matter. The best bag to<br />\ncarry is one which is placed in front of the<br />\nwheel (not over the handle-bar), and which is<br />\nfastened by two straps to the handle-bar, and<br />\nby a third strap to the front bar of the frame,<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nnear the fork.

Since<br />\nthe invention of the concave grating by Prof.<br />\nRowland, all the laboratories in the world have<br />\nbeen gradually acquiring grating-spectroscopes; but, naturally, no laboratory is so well<br />\nequipped as ours.

It is our intention to arrange for several courses of lectures given by various distinguished professors and observers from a distance.<br />\n\"In the field of engineering, especial attention will be given the needs of advanced students. The purpose in this is to offer to electrical engineers and others those facilities in the<br />\nway of lectures and laboratory work which are<br />\nnot available elsewhere in this country.

The '99 \"Hullabaloo,\" which is now in<br />\npress, follows the general rule in this regard.<br />\nThe cover is in cloth and paper, with simple<br />\nlettering and new color effects. A new shade<br />\nof red is the important feature. The title page<br />\nis an exquisite water-color design reproduced<br />\nby the three-color process. This is an entirely<br />\nnew departure in Hopkins annuals, and promises to be one of the most attractive features<br />\nof this year's book.<br />\nThe leading article is written by President<br />\nGilman, under the title, \"Early Days at Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" It includes many interesting reminiscences of the founding of the University<br />\nand anecdotes about men connected with its<br />\nearly development. An excellent steel engraving of President Gilman serves as frontispiece. This is the first time that such a process has been used, and this year's \"Hullabaloo\" is the first book for a number of years<br />\nto contain a portrait of the President.<br />\nThroughout the book, special attention has<br />\nbeen paid to illustrations. The title drawings<br />\nwill be found of unusual merit. The senior<br />\nclass is presented in detail with a half-tone portrait of each member. The usual athletic organizations and miscellaneous clubs are well<br />\nrepresented. Care has been taken to omit unnecessary statistics and long articles. The<br />\nliterary articles are short and interesting. A<br />\nfew more or less prominent individuals are the<br />\nsubjects of mild satire. The military enthusiasm of last year is not forgotten. A spirited<br />\nmock-heroic relates the events that centered<br />\nabout the junior banquet of last year.<br />\nThe number of pages is reduced, relieving<br />\nthe book of unnecessary bulkiness, and a new<br />\nshape has been adopted.

HILL, 1900.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nnusicAL CLUBS' ELECTIONS.<br />\nThe recent elections of the Glee, Banjo and<br />\nMandolin Clubs have decided the officers and<br />\nleaders of the organization for the year of<br />\nI899-19oo. E. Skipwith Bruce, who has acted<br />\nas assistant manager during the last year, was<br />\nelected president, while John H. King, under<br />\nwhose successful management the clubs have<br />\npaid off a two-year old debt of over two hundred dollars, will continue to represent the<br />\nbusiness end, with Wilson L. Smith as assistant manager. Charles A. Vogeler and Walter<br />\nKrager will lead the Mandolin and Banjo<br />\nClubs respectively. Both have had extensive<br />\nclub experience. Vogeler has played on the<br />\nLawrenceville and Johns Hopkins Clubs, while<br />\nKrager has played for several years on both<br />\nthe Banjo and Mandolin Clubs of the University. Stephen Harwood will add to his ancient role of \"star song bird,\" the leadership of<br />\nthe Glee Club. The officers and leaders of the<br />\nvarious clubs promise to fulfill their parts well,<br />\nand there is every reason to hope for good<br />\nclubs next year. The pleasure to be derived<br />\nfrom membership is well known, and an excellent chance will be offered next year for new<br />\nmen to get places. The summer vacation will<br />\nafford an excellent opportunity for learning to<br />\nplay a banjo or mandolin, and thus securing<br />\none of the vacancies that will occur next<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe gay brilliance of the basement has gone;<br />\nthe Medical and Chirurgical Faculty has left<br />\nus, but long after their departure the corridors<br />\nof McCoy Hall have been decked with portraits of some of the most distinguished physicians that the Faculty has numbered among<br />\nits members\u2014men who have gained honor for<br />\nthemselves and Maryland in their profession.<br />\nConsidering the high place the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School holds, it was fitting that this<br />\nimportant celebration of the moth anniversary of the Medical Faculty should be held at<br />\nthe University. The meetings were under the<br />\ndirection of Dr. S. C. Chew, President of the<br />\nFaculty. A number of instructive papers were<br />\nread and addresses made on the theory and<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nhistory of medicine by prominent physicians<br />\nand surgeons.<br />\n<br />\n.st<br />\n2tbIettc0.<br />\n<br />\nCRESCENTS, 5 ; HOPKINS, 2.<br />\nOn the, 29th our lacrosse team lined up<br />\nagainst the famous Crescent Athletic Club, the<br />\nchampions of this country for the past five or<br />\nsix years. Although our team suffered defeat, it played a magnificent game, holding the<br />\nscore down to 5 to 2, the same score by which<br />\nthe Crescents beat Toronto University, the<br />\nchampions of Canada, last year. Unfortunately both Abercrombie and Fitzgerald were<br />\nhurt early in the game by the needlessly rough<br />\nplaying of the Crescents, thus weakening our<br />\nteam. The score at the end of the first half<br />\nwas 2 to 1. McInnes, Maddren and Guggenheimer so distinguished themselves that they<br />\nwere asked to play for the champions this<br />\nsummer. \"Billy \"Hodges,a member of our '98<br />\nteam, played third attack for the visitors, and<br />\nwas a conspicuous thorn in our side. As the<br />\nCrescents said, it was a fine, close-fought<br />\ngame, and showed once again what true fighting blood our boys have.<br />\nIn compliance with the desires of influential<br />\nmembers of the Athletic Association, the trustees have lately decided to designate a new<br />\n\"Committee on Athletics and Gymnastics,\"<br />\ntwo members of which represent the faculty,<br />\nthree the recent alumni, and two the resident<br />\nstudents. The members of the committee<br />\nrepresenting the authorities are Prof. Renouf,<br />\nwho has been for many years deeply interested<br />\nin Hopkins athletics, and Prof. Reid, who was<br />\ndistinguished as a gymnast in his undergraduate days, and was one of the earliest advocates of a new gymnasium. The alumni members, as both students and as alumni, have<br />\nmaintained a warm interest in the University's<br />\nathletic welfare. They are: Allan McLane,<br />\nA. B., 1886; James Shaler Hodges, A. B.,<br />\n1886; George C. Morrison, A. B., 189o. The<br />\nstudents on the committee are W. H. Maddren, of the Medical School and lacrosse team,<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nand R. H. Grimes, of the class of '99 and also<br />\nof the lacrosse team.<br />\nThis committee has selected Mr. William<br />\nW. Mackdermott as Instructor in Athletics<br />\nand Gymnastics, and their nomination has<br />\nbeen confirmed by the trustees.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 12,; STEVENS, I.<br />\nStevens came down from the Dutch precincts of Hoboken with the earnest and fixed<br />\nintention of cleaning things up hereabouts.<br />\nUpon close inspection we must admit that they<br />\nsucceeded, only, unfortunately for Stevens,<br />\nthey put the cart before the horse. Poor Stevens certainly traveled a thorny road; confident of victory, and determined to avenge their<br />\n8 to i defeat of last year, they fell Saturday<br />\ntwelve various times. Upon the whole, we<br />\ncannot wonder that MacDonald, the Stevens<br />\ncaptain, wanted to know where we got such a<br />\nteam; nor at his astonishment upon being informed that it was the work of an American<br />\namateur coach, our great star player, Maddren. The game started off with a rush, Stevens tallying the first goal after thiry-five seconds of play, by fast, perfect tipping, catching and running. That woke up our attack,<br />\nand for the next ten minutes they kept pegging away at the Stevens goal, only to be<br />\nthwarted again and again by the really miraculous work of the Stevens goal-keeper, Layatt. Suddenly Abercrombie gets the ball, tips<br />\nit to \"Fitz,\" who sends it to McInnes; bang it<br />\ngoes to Grimes, and swat! it is in the goal net.<br />\nThe score is tied. During the rest of the half<br />\nthe J. H. U. attack chased the ball around the<br />\nlot to the tune of six more goals. The chief<br />\nirouble at the beginning was the combination<br />\nof Stevens' brilliant playing and the nervousness of our attack.<br />\nThe second half was even more savagely<br />\nfought, for Stevens became desperate, but,<br />\neven playing probably better than they ever<br />\ndid before, they could not stop our scoring,<br />\nnor score against the best lacrosse team that<br />\never represented an American college.<br />\n<br />\nAs for the individual playing, it is hard to<br />\nparticularize when every man is a star. Abercrombie, our \"Aber,\" was everywhere and<br />\nanywhere, now playing on the defense, now<br />\ncarrying the ball down to the attack, now<br />\nshooting at goal. He played a truly wonderful game, and showed his great fund of endurance and skill. Grimes, Fitzgerald, McInnes,<br />\nBandel and Sayler all did heroically, and if<br />\nspace permitted would be individually complimented. The playing of the defense field,<br />\nFoster, Bruton and Tyler, was a revelation to<br />\nthose who realized that it was a green defense.<br />\nFoster, especially, did great work. Both Maddren and \"Guggy\" did even better than their<br />\nbest, and electrified the crowd again and again<br />\nwith their brilliant playing. Griffin also<br />\nshowed out to advantage, with his telling running and his body-checking. In fact, the<br />\nwhole team was one large constellation.<br />\n<br />\nTFIE TRACK TEAM<br />\n<br />\nIn the annual spring games held last Saturday by Georgetown University, at Washington, our track and field team continued to win<br />\nhonors. After several weeks of steady training under Father Mack, the boys were in fine<br />\nform.<br />\nIn the number of points scored we stood<br />\nnext to Georgetown herself, and if Garrett had<br />\nbeen entered also we might have stood about<br />\nequal. Mullen did some pretty work against<br />\nthe Georgetown cracks ill the quarter-mile,<br />\nwinning fourth place against all the stars, such<br />\nas Mulligan and others. Scholl jumped five<br />\nfeet nine inches, tying for first place in the<br />\nhigh jump and winning the broad. The fact<br />\nthat he lost on the toss of a coin does not detract from the merit of his work. In the halfmile, Riggs, our star half-back of last fall, ran<br />\na beautiful race, winning second place against<br />\nsome of Georgetown's best runners.<br />\nClark did some steady running, and made a<br />\nthird place. Knapp was third in the 220-yard<br />\ndash, and third in the mo-yard finals.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTo every Hopkins man who witnessed the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania relay races, on<br />\nFranklin Field, on Saturday, May 29, there<br />\ncame a thrill of pleasure when he saw Mullen trotting in ahead of Armstrong, the University of Maryland sprinter. To be sure,<br />\nthere were but two competitors in the class,<br />\nMaryland and Hopkins, since Columbian University, of Washington, and St. John's College, failed to appear, but there was a certain<br />\nextreme delight in beating Maryland. It is<br />\nsaid that the faculty of Columbian disapproved<br />\nof the endeavors that were made to secure athletic material, and for that reason summarily<br />\n\"shut down\" on the track team, and refused<br />\nthem permission to enter.<br />\n- Clark, Riggs, Captain Knapp and Mullen<br />\nran in the order named, and each beat his man<br />\nout. From the time Clark started to gain on<br />\nMcPhail, the Hopkins boys were never<br />\nheaded, and it was merely a question of what<br />\nCaptain<br />\nour lead would be at the finish.<br />\nKnapp ran in beautiful form, and considerably<br />\nincreased the size of the gap between Miller<br />\nand himself. Mullen ran the last quarter, and<br />\nassured our sprinters of their gold watches<br />\nand banner. The latter has been added to the<br />\nnumber which already adorn the north wall of<br />\nthe common room. George Radcliffe, who<br />\nwas a regular member of the victorious team<br />\nlast year, was the only substitute. Coachelect Mackdermott accompanied the team to<br />\nPhiladelphia, where they went on the Friday<br />\nbefore the games, and put up at the Colonnade Hotel, where Cornell and other of the<br />\nteams were domiciled.<br />\nRiggs, who did such creditable work on the<br />\n'Varsity football team last season, as well as<br />\nin-the B. A. C. games at the rink, and Clark,<br />\nthe two new members of the relay team, ran<br />\nwell, and more than held their own with the<br />\nMaryland runners. The record of 3.43 1-5,<br />\nmade last year by Hopkins, was reduced onefifth of a second.<br />\nAs the Black and Blue has now won in her<br />\nclass two years in succession, it is believed that<br />\nnext year she will be placed in a higher class,<br />\npossibly with Georgetown.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 We are looking forward now with great<br />\nexpectancy to the intercollegiate baseball<br />\nchampionship'of the State. By our victory<br />\nover Western Maryland, on Saturday, we neutralized the bad effects of our defeat by Gallaudet on the preceding Saturday, and stand<br />\njust as we formerly did\u2014at the top of the list.<br />\nGallaudet lost to Washington College by a<br />\nscore of 3 to 5, and our victory thus places us<br />\neven with the mutes for first place. We have<br />\nalready badly defeated Washington College,<br />\nthe only team which was to be feared, and the<br />\nAgriculturals should be easy now.<br />\nOf the three games which have been played<br />\nsince our last issue, two have been defeats,<br />\nand one, a victory. The game with Gallaudet<br />\nshould have been won easily, and there is<br />\nreally no excuse for losing it. Stage fright<br />\ndid it. When the score was 6 to i in our<br />\nfavor, to go to work and make enough errors<br />\nto let the other side beat us out was pretty bad<br />\nwork. Perhaps we shouldn't criticise the<br />\nteam for nervousness which can't be helped,<br />\nbut, what on earth was there to be afraid of?<br />\nWe are really much stronger than they are, and<br />\nif we get another chance we'll prove it.<br />\nWe expected Georgetown to wipe up the<br />\nfloor with us\u2014and she did it. Georgetown<br />\nhas won an uninterrupted string of victories<br />\nthis spring, and of course we couldn't do anything at all with her. But we might have<br />\nmade at least one run.<br />\nWe could not bat, that was the main trouble. Wight, Joyner and Clarke, the heavy<br />\nhitters, simply fanned at Bach's and Kenna's<br />\ncurves, and only one man got to third base.<br />\nStrouse was ailing, too. He had to pitch .<br />\nwhile he was not feeling well, and poor support soon rattled him. The score, 15 to o, tells<br />\nthe tale.<br />\nAt Westminster, Strouse was on hand with<br />\na fine assortment of new and original strikeouts, and succeeded in imposing eleven of<br />\nthem upon the collegians. He had perfect<br />\nsupport, too, the infield and outfield vying in<br />\nthe good work. The batting was also up to<br />\nthe standard. The whole team put up a fine<br />\ngame.<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nA little more of this kind of work and we<br />\nshall have the pennant. Then Captain Joyner<br />\nand Jimmy Swaine, and the others who persevered early in the season, will be able to feel<br />\nthat they have the approval and admiration of<br />\nall their fellow-students.<br />\n\"MINER PHYSICS.\"<br />\nEz I wuz shuvin' boxes 'round t'earn me daily<br />\nbread,<br />\n'N me pulse wuz beatin' weary, 'n me arms<br />\nwuz gittin' dead,<br />\nI happened, lookin' t'rough a door, upon er<br />\nfunny sight,<br />\nI hollors t' de janiter, 'n squints wid all me<br />\nmight.<br />\n\"Wot makes de succers sweat so hard, wot<br />\nmakes 'em squirm 'n shrink?\" '<br />\n\"Dey're bein' quizzed,\" responds me pard, \"'n<br />\ndey're tryin' t' t'ink,<br />\nWi(l splutt'ring questions in der ears 'n mem'ry growin' low,<br />\nW'ile Am-s is learnin' acc'rately de t'ings det<br />\ndey dunno.\"<br />\nPer he's quizzin' \"Miner Physics,\" he is quizzin' em t'day,<br />\nHe's tramplin' on der feelinks in a bloomin'<br />\nbrutal way,<br />\nHe's loadin\"em wid zeros w'ich he's stickin'<br />\non ter stay,<br />\n'N he's quizzin' \"Miner Physics\" in der morr-nin'.<br />\n\"Wot kind er cove is Am\u2014s?\" asks I, wid curiosity;<br />\n\"He is an enenint Physacist\u2014a queer monstrosity;<br />\nWritin\"laws uv nature' on er board in rigid<br />\ncalculations,<br />\nEz if Gawd, t' make de universe, used Algebra<br />\nequations.\"<br />\n\"W'y are some holdin' up der paws, 'n most<br />\nare lookin' pale?\"<br />\n\"He's asked who's studied 'nature's laws'\u2014de<br />\npaws dey tells de tale.<br />\nSo dey're between de devil 'n a very deep blue<br />\nsea.\"<br />\nI asks, \"W'ich is de devil?\" \"I leave det t'<br />\nyou,\" sez he.<br />\n<br />\nPer he's quizzin' \"Miner Physics,\" he is quizzin' em t'day,<br />\nDey're wigglin\"n dey're wormin', but dey kinnot git away;<br />\nDe blood is zoonin' in der heads, de numbers<br />\ngrowin' gray,<br />\n'N he's quizzin' \"Miner Physics\" in de morr-nin'.<br />\n'N wid det, I wint t' wur-rk wid a lighter<br />\nheart, t'inking det it wuz more fun shuvin' a<br />\nbox around den findin' its inertia.<br />\nORLANDO MCGINNIS, A.

It is hard to lay down fixed rules on<br />\nthis subject. I therefore propose to give<br />\nmerely a few general hints, and to state some<br />\nof my personal experiences in this line of sport.<br />\nFirst, then, as to the bicycle itself. It is not<br />\nWO much trouble to take one's own wheel to<br />\nEurope. The freight across the Atlantic<br />\namounts only to two or three dollars, and, if<br />\nthe wheel be well packed in a wooden box, it<br />\nwill not suffer on the journey. Bicycles can<br />\nbe landed in England free of charge, but on<br />\nthe continent this is not the case. It is, therefore, advisable for tourists intending to cycle<br />\non the continent to join the \"Cyclist's Touring<br />\nClub,\" of England, or the \"Touring Club,\" of<br />\nFrance. To do this, it is necessary only to<br />\nsend the dues to the secretary of either club,<br />\ntogether with the names of two indorsers who<br />\nare already members. The C. T. C. is now<br />\njust as useful on the continent as the C. T. F.,<br />\nand members of the English Club are permitted to take their wheels to the continent without making the usual deposit of ten or twelve<br />\ndollars.<br />\nWith regard to the gear of the wheel, my experience has been that for all round touring,<br />\nwhich is liable to embrace the mountains of<br />\nSwitzerland and Italy, as well as the hills of<br />\nEngland and Scotland, the gear should not<br />\nexceed seventy to seventy-three inches.<br />\nI am a great advocate of the double tire\u2014<br />\nthe Dunlop or any .other good make. Of<br />\ncourse, partisans of the single tube are to be<br />\nfound, but apart from the fact that these tires<br />\nare little used in Europe (and therefore could<br />\nnot be so easily repaired en route in case of a<br />\nserious break), there can be no denying the<br /><br />\nNo. 15<br /><br />\nfact that, even if the double tire requires<br />\nslightly more labor to mend, the repair once<br />\nmade is more permanent. On the sharp flints<br />\nwhich are found on French roads it is not unusual to puncture one's tire two or three times<br />\nin one afternoon, and a single tube with five<br />\nor six repairs in it becomes, to say the least,<br />\nsomewhat \"porous.\" Beware, intending tourist, of using wooden rims with a clincher-tire<br />\nof the type of the Dunlop. For this experiment I once paid with half an hour of unconsciousness, which came upon me without<br />\nwarning in the middle of a delightful \"coast\"<br />\nin the Shenandoah valley. Let the aspirant<br />\nto the twenty-mile \"coasts\" of the Alps be<br />\nwarned, also, against riding without a brake,<br />\nor using a brake which is in any way inefficient. For this slight lapse from the path of<br />\nperfect prudence I was once rewarded by an<br />\ninstantaneous leap from my wheel on the brink<br />\nof the Ticino, on the St. Gothard, and by the<br />\ndeplorable sight of a mangled front fork. My<br />\nexperience, it will be seen, has been hardearned, and the reader should at least regard<br />\nmy advice as sincere.<br />\nBy all means, ride with a gear case. I have<br />\nridden with one from London to Edinburgh<br />\nand back without once cleaning my chain, and<br />\noiling it only once. In London a gear case<br />\ncan be bought and fitted over the chain for five<br />\nor six dollars.<br />\nMud-guards may be dispensed with, and the<br />\nuse of a lamp may be obviated by arranging<br />\none's schedule so as to reach one's destination<br />\ndaily at a certain time. In Italy, however, the<br />\nregulations about lamps are somewhat severe.<br />\nThere remains the question of baggage, by<br />\nno means a simple matter. The best bag to<br />\ncarry is one which is placed in front of the<br />\nwheel (not over the handle-bar), and which is<br />\nfastened by two straps to the handle-bar, and<br />\nby a third strap to the front bar of the frame,<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nnear the fork.

It is our intention to arrange for several courses of lectures given by various distinguished professors and observers from a distance.<br />\n\"In the field of engineering, especial attention will be given the needs of advanced students.

The '99 \"Hullabaloo,\" which is now in<br />\npress, follows the general rule in this regard.<br />\nThe cover is in cloth and paper, with simple<br />\nlettering and new color effects. A new shade<br />\nof red is the important feature. The title page<br />\nis an exquisite water-color design reproduced<br />\nby the three-color process. This is an entirely<br />\nnew departure in Hopkins annuals, and promises to be one of the most attractive features<br />\nof this year's book.<br />\nThe leading article is written by President<br />\nGilman, under the title, \"Early Days at Johns<br />\nHopkins.\" It includes many interesting reminiscences of the founding of the University<br />\nand anecdotes about men connected with its<br />\nearly development. An excellent steel engraving of President Gilman serves as frontispiece. This is the first time that such a process has been used, and this year's \"Hullabaloo\" is the first book for a number of years<br />\nto contain a portrait of the President.<br />\nThroughout the book, special attention has<br />\nbeen paid to illustrations. The title drawings<br />\nwill be found of unusual merit. The senior<br />\nclass is presented in detail with a half-tone portrait of each member. The usual athletic organizations and miscellaneous clubs are well<br />\nrepresented. Care has been taken to omit unnecessary statistics and long articles. The<br />\nliterary articles are short and interesting. A<br />\nfew more or less prominent individuals are the<br />\nsubjects of mild satire. The military enthusiasm of last year is not forgotten. A spirited<br />\nmock-heroic relates the events that centered<br />\nabout the junior banquet of last year.<br />\nThe number of pages is reduced, relieving<br />\nthe book of unnecessary bulkiness, and a new<br />\nshape has been adopted.

HILL, 1900.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nnusicAL CLUBS' ELECTIONS.<br />\nThe recent elections of the Glee, Banjo and<br />\nMandolin Clubs have decided the officers and<br />\nleaders of the organization for the year of<br />\nI899-19oo. E. Skipwith Bruce, who has acted<br />\nas assistant manager during the last year, was<br />\nelected president, while John H. King, under<br />\nwhose successful management the clubs have<br />\npaid off a two-year old debt of over two hundred dollars, will continue to represent the<br />\nbusiness end, with Wilson L. Smith as assistant manager. Charles A. Vogeler and Walter<br />\nKrager will lead the Mandolin and Banjo<br />\nClubs respectively. Both have had extensive<br />\nclub experience. Vogeler has played on the<br />\nLawrenceville and Johns Hopkins Clubs, while<br />\nKrager has played for several years on both<br />\nthe Banjo and Mandolin Clubs of the University. Stephen Harwood will add to his ancient role of \"star song bird,\" the leadership of<br />\nthe Glee Club. The officers and leaders of the<br />\nvarious clubs promise to fulfill their parts well,<br />\nand there is every reason to hope for good<br />\nclubs next year. The pleasure to be derived<br />\nfrom membership is well known, and an excellent chance will be offered next year for new<br />\nmen to get places. The summer vacation will<br />\nafford an excellent opportunity for learning to<br />\nplay a banjo or mandolin, and thus securing<br />\none of the vacancies that will occur next<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe gay brilliance of the basement has gone;<br />\nthe Medical and Chirurgical Faculty has left<br />\nus, but long after their departure the corridors<br />\nof McCoy Hall have been decked with portraits of some of the most distinguished physicians that the Faculty has numbered among<br />\nits members\u2014men who have gained honor for<br />\nthemselves and Maryland in their profession.<br />\nConsidering the high place the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School holds, it was fitting that this<br />\nimportant celebration of the moth anniversary of the Medical Faculty should be held at<br />\nthe University. The meetings were under the<br />\ndirection of Dr. S. C. Chew, President of the<br />\nFaculty. A number of instructive papers were<br />\nread and addresses made on the theory and<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nhistory of medicine by prominent physicians<br />\nand surgeons.<br /><br />\n.st<br />\n2tbIettc0.<br /><br />\nCRESCENTS, 5 ; HOPKINS, 2.<br />\nOn the, 29th our lacrosse team lined up<br />\nagainst the famous Crescent Athletic Club, the<br />\nchampions of this country for the past five or<br />\nsix years. Although our team suffered defeat, it played a magnificent game, holding the<br />\nscore down to 5 to 2, the same score by which<br />\nthe Crescents beat Toronto University, the<br />\nchampions of Canada, last year. Unfortunately both Abercrombie and Fitzgerald were<br />\nhurt early in the game by the needlessly rough<br />\nplaying of the Crescents, thus weakening our<br />\nteam. The score at the end of the first half<br />\nwas 2 to 1. McInnes, Maddren and Guggenheimer so distinguished themselves that they<br />\nwere asked to play for the champions this<br />\nsummer. \"Billy \"Hodges,a member of our '98<br />\nteam, played third attack for the visitors, and<br />\nwas a conspicuous thorn in our side. As the<br />\nCrescents said, it was a fine, close-fought<br />\ngame, and showed once again what true fighting blood our boys have.<br />\nIn compliance with the desires of influential<br />\nmembers of the Athletic Association, the trustees have lately decided to designate a new<br />\n\"Committee on Athletics and Gymnastics,\"<br />\ntwo members of which represent the faculty,<br />\nthree the recent alumni, and two the resident<br />\nstudents. The members of the committee<br />\nrepresenting the authorities are Prof. Renouf,<br />\nwho has been for many years deeply interested<br />\nin Hopkins athletics, and Prof. Reid, who was<br />\ndistinguished as a gymnast in his undergraduate days, and was one of the earliest advocates of a new gymnasium. The alumni members, as both students and as alumni, have<br />\nmaintained a warm interest in the University's<br />\nathletic welfare. They are: Allan McLane,<br />\nA. B., 1886; James Shaler Hodges, A. B.,<br />\n1886; George C. Morrison, A. B., 189o. The<br />\nstudents on the committee are W. H. Maddren, of the Medical School and lacrosse team,<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nand R. H. Grimes, of the class of '99 and also<br />\nof the lacrosse team.<br />\nThis committee has selected Mr. William<br />\nW. Mackdermott as Instructor in Athletics<br />\nand Gymnastics, and their nomination has<br />\nbeen confirmed by the trustees.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 12,; STEVENS, I.<br />\nStevens came down from the Dutch precincts of Hoboken with the earnest and fixed<br />\nintention of cleaning things up hereabouts.<br />\nUpon close inspection we must admit that they<br />\nsucceeded, only, unfortunately for Stevens,<br />\nthey put the cart before the horse. Poor Stevens certainly traveled a thorny road; confident of victory, and determined to avenge their<br />\n8 to i defeat of last year, they fell Saturday<br />\ntwelve various times. Upon the whole, we<br />\ncannot wonder that MacDonald, the Stevens<br />\ncaptain, wanted to know where we got such a<br />\nteam; nor at his astonishment upon being informed that it was the work of an American<br />\namateur coach, our great star player, Maddren. The game started off with a rush, Stevens tallying the first goal after thiry-five seconds of play, by fast, perfect tipping, catching and running. That woke up our attack,<br />\nand for the next ten minutes they kept pegging away at the Stevens goal, only to be<br />\nthwarted again and again by the really miraculous work of the Stevens goal-keeper, Layatt. Suddenly Abercrombie gets the ball, tips<br />\nit to \"Fitz,\" who sends it to McInnes; bang it<br />\ngoes to Grimes, and swat! it is in the goal net.<br />\nThe score is tied. During the rest of the half<br />\nthe J. H. U. attack chased the ball around the<br />\nlot to the tune of six more goals. The chief<br />\nirouble at the beginning was the combination<br />\nof Stevens' brilliant playing and the nervousness of our attack.<br />\nThe second half was even more savagely<br />\nfought, for Stevens became desperate, but,<br />\neven playing probably better than they ever<br />\ndid before, they could not stop our scoring,<br />\nnor score against the best lacrosse team that<br />\never represented an American college.<br /><br />\nAs for the individual playing, it is hard to<br />\nparticularize when every man is a star. Abercrombie, our \"Aber,\" was everywhere and<br />\nanywhere, now playing on the defense, now<br />\ncarrying the ball down to the attack, now<br />\nshooting at goal. He played a truly wonderful game, and showed his great fund of endurance and skill. Grimes, Fitzgerald, McInnes,<br />\nBandel and Sayler all did heroically, and if<br />\nspace permitted would be individually complimented. The playing of the defense field,<br />\nFoster, Bruton and Tyler, was a revelation to<br />\nthose who realized that it was a green defense.<br />\nFoster, especially, did great work. Both Maddren and \"Guggy\" did even better than their<br />\nbest, and electrified the crowd again and again<br />\nwith their brilliant playing. Griffin also<br />\nshowed out to advantage, with his telling running and his body-checking. In fact, the<br />\nwhole team was one large constellation.<br /><br />\nTFIE TRACK TEAM<br /><br />\nIn the annual spring games held last Saturday by Georgetown University, at Washington, our track and field team continued to win<br />\nhonors. After several weeks of steady training under Father Mack, the boys were in fine<br />\nform.<br />\nIn the number of points scored we stood<br />\nnext to Georgetown herself, and if Garrett had<br />\nbeen entered also we might have stood about<br />\nequal. Mullen did some pretty work against<br />\nthe Georgetown cracks ill the quarter-mile,<br />\nwinning fourth place against all the stars, such<br />\nas Mulligan and others. Scholl jumped five<br />\nfeet nine inches, tying for first place in the<br />\nhigh jump and winning the broad. The fact<br />\nthat he lost on the toss of a coin does not detract from the merit of his work. In the halfmile, Riggs, our star half-back of last fall, ran<br />\na beautiful race, winning second place against<br />\nsome of Georgetown's best runners.<br />\nClark did some steady running, and made a<br />\nthird place. Knapp was third in the 220-yard<br />\ndash, and third in the mo-yard finals.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTo every Hopkins man who witnessed the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania relay races, on<br />\nFranklin Field, on Saturday, May 29, there<br />\ncame a thrill of pleasure when he saw Mullen trotting in ahead of Armstrong, the University of Maryland sprinter. To be sure,<br />\nthere were but two competitors in the class,<br />\nMaryland and Hopkins, since Columbian University, of Washington, and St. John's College, failed to appear, but there was a certain<br />\nextreme delight in beating Maryland. It is<br />\nsaid that the faculty of Columbian disapproved<br />\nof the endeavors that were made to secure athletic material, and for that reason summarily<br />\n\"shut down\" on the track team, and refused<br />\nthem permission to enter.<br />\n- Clark, Riggs, Captain Knapp and Mullen<br />\nran in the order named, and each beat his man<br />\nout. From the time Clark started to gain on<br />\nMcPhail, the Hopkins boys were never<br />\nheaded, and it was merely a question of what<br />\nCaptain<br />\nour lead would be at the finish.<br />\nKnapp ran in beautiful form, and considerably<br />\nincreased the size of the gap between Miller<br />\nand himself. Mullen ran the last quarter, and<br />\nassured our sprinters of their gold watches<br />\nand banner. The latter has been added to the<br />\nnumber which already adorn the north wall of<br />\nthe common room. George Radcliffe, who<br />\nwas a regular member of the victorious team<br />\nlast year, was the only substitute. Coachelect Mackdermott accompanied the team to<br />\nPhiladelphia, where they went on the Friday<br />\nbefore the games, and put up at the Colonnade Hotel, where Cornell and other of the<br />\nteams were domiciled.<br />\nRiggs, who did such creditable work on the<br />\n'Varsity football team last season, as well as<br />\nin-the B. A. C. games at the rink, and Clark,<br />\nthe two new members of the relay team, ran<br />\nwell, and more than held their own with the<br />\nMaryland runners. The record of 3.43 1-5,<br />\nmade last year by Hopkins, was reduced onefifth of a second.<br />\nAs the Black and Blue has now won in her<br />\nclass two years in succession, it is believed that<br />\nnext year she will be placed in a higher class,<br />\npossibly with Georgetown.<br /><br />\n7<br />\nBASEBALL.<br /><br />\n\u2022 We are looking forward now with great<br />\nexpectancy to the intercollegiate baseball<br />\nchampionship'of the State. By our victory<br />\nover Western Maryland, on Saturday, we neutralized the bad effects of our defeat by Gallaudet on the preceding Saturday, and stand<br />\njust as we formerly did\u2014at the top of the list.<br />\nGallaudet lost to Washington College by a<br />\nscore of 3 to 5, and our victory thus places us<br />\neven with the mutes for first place. We have<br />\nalready badly defeated Washington College,<br />\nthe only team which was to be feared, and the<br />\nAgriculturals should be easy now.<br />\nOf the three games which have been played<br />\nsince our last issue, two have been defeats,<br />\nand one, a victory. The game with Gallaudet<br />\nshould have been won easily, and there is<br />\nreally no excuse for losing it. Stage fright<br />\ndid it. When the score was 6 to i in our<br />\nfavor, to go to work and make enough errors<br />\nto let the other side beat us out was pretty bad<br />\nwork. Perhaps we shouldn't criticise the<br />\nteam for nervousness which can't be helped,<br />\nbut, what on earth was there to be afraid of?<br />\nWe are really much stronger than they are, and<br />\nif we get another chance we'll prove it.<br />\nWe expected Georgetown to wipe up the<br />\nfloor with us\u2014and she did it. Georgetown<br />\nhas won an uninterrupted string of victories<br />\nthis spring, and of course we couldn't do anything at all with her. But we might have<br />\nmade at least one run.<br />\nWe could not bat, that was the main trouble. Wight, Joyner and Clarke, the heavy<br />\nhitters, simply fanned at Bach's and Kenna's<br />\ncurves, and only one man got to third base.<br />\nStrouse was ailing, too. He had to pitch .<br />\nwhile he was not feeling well, and poor support soon rattled him. The score, 15 to o, tells<br />\nthe tale.<br />\nAt Westminster, Strouse was on hand with<br />\na fine assortment of new and original strikeouts, and succeeded in imposing eleven of<br />\nthem upon the collegians. He had perfect<br />\nsupport, too, the infield and outfield vying in<br />\nthe good work. The batting was also up to<br />\nthe standard. The whole team put up a fine<br />\ngame.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nA little more of this kind of work and we<br />\nshall have the pennant. Then Captain Joyner<br />\nand Jimmy Swaine, and the others who persevered early in the season, will be able to feel<br />\nthat they have the approval and admiration of<br />\nall their fellow-students.<br />\n\"MINER PHYSICS.\"<br />\nEz I wuz shuvin' boxes 'round t'earn me daily<br />\nbread,<br />\n'N me pulse wuz beatin' weary, 'n me arms<br />\nwuz gittin' dead,<br />\nI happened, lookin' t'rough a door, upon er<br />\nfunny sight,<br />\nI hollors t' de janiter, 'n squints wid all me<br />\nmight.<br />\n\"Wot makes de succers sweat so hard, wot<br />\nmakes 'em squirm 'n shrink?\" '<br />\n\"Dey're bein' quizzed,\" responds me pard, \"'n<br />\ndey're tryin' t' t'ink,<br />\nWi(l splutt'ring questions in der ears 'n mem'ry growin' low,<br />\nW'ile Am-s is learnin' acc'rately de t'ings det<br />\ndey dunno.\"<br />\nPer he's quizzin' \"Miner Physics,\" he is quizzin' em t'day,<br />\nHe's tramplin' on der feelinks in a bloomin'<br />\nbrutal way,<br />\nHe's loadin\"em wid zeros w'ich he's stickin'<br />\non ter stay,<br />\n'N he's quizzin' \"Miner Physics\" in der morr-nin'.<br />\n\"Wot kind er cove is Am\u2014s?\" asks I, wid curiosity;<br />\n\"He is an enenint Physacist\u2014a queer monstrosity;<br />\nWritin\"laws uv nature' on er board in rigid<br />\ncalculations,<br />\nEz if Gawd, t' make de universe, used Algebra<br />\nequations.\"<br />\n\"W'y are some holdin' up der paws, 'n most<br />\nare lookin' pale?\"<br />\n\"He's asked who's studied 'nature's laws'\u2014de<br />\npaws dey tells de tale.<br />\nSo dey're between de devil 'n a very deep blue<br />\nsea.\"<br />\nI asks, \"W'ich is de devil?\" \"I leave det t'<br />\nyou,\" sez he.<br /><br />\nPer he's quizzin' \"Miner Physics,\" he is quizzin' em t'day,<br />\nDey're wigglin\"n dey're wormin', but dey kinnot git away;<br />\nDe blood is zoonin' in der heads, de numbers<br />\ngrowin' gray,<br />\n'N he's quizzin' \"Miner Physics\" in de morr-nin'.<br />\n'N wid det, I wint t' wur-rk wid a lighter<br />\nheart, t'inking det it wuz more fun shuvin' a<br />\nbox around den findin' its inertia.<br />\nORLANDO MCGINNIS, A.
