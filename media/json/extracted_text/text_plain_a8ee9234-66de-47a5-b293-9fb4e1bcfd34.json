We do not think there is any definite set of traits<br />\nwhich can be ascribed to the ideal teacher. His type is varied. Some<br />\nare successful because they are speakers of ability who hold the attention of their classes; others use wit to gain student interest, some who<br />\nare students of their subject succeed because of the lucid manner in<br />\nwhich they \"put across\" their explanations, and still others are so well<br />\nregarded by their students on grounds of personality alone that the<br />\nactual work of the course becomes a pleasure.<br />\nNo teacher who actually aspires to be more than a mere pedagogue<br />\ncan put himself above the criticism of his students.

Some<br />\nare successful because they are speakers of ability who hold the attention of their classes; others use wit to gain student interest, some who<br />\nare students of their subject succeed because of the lucid manner in<br />\nwhich they \"put across\" their explanations, and still others are so well<br />\nregarded by their students on grounds of personality alone that the<br />\nactual work of the course becomes a pleasure.<br />\nNo teacher who actually aspires to be more than a mere pedagogue<br />\ncan put himself above the criticism of his students.
